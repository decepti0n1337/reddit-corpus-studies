A 2021 study about meaning and sentiment of the word "salty" used in Reddit.

The researchers spent approximately 140 hours compiling the language corpus through Google Colaboratory. Our language corpus consists of 3,560 text files from 10 subreddits, divided into 365 files per subreddit. Each file contains a day's worth of comments. The token count is 215,487,429 and there are 614,497 unique words.

From observing the word salty in context and from co-occurring words, it is found that salty is often used with nouns that refer to younger people such as 'baby', 'boy' (or 'boi'), 'child', 'kid', 'kiddo', 'preteen', but It is also used with people who have a lot of experience, like the word 'vet'. Nouns used to refer to people who meet with the word salty often refer to people who lack maturity, such as 'crybaby', 'manchild', and 'immature', etc. The word salty often appears together with many nouns that are considered swear words, profanity, pejorative terms such as 'cuck' (from 'cuckold'), 'fucker', 'neckbeard' and 'whore', etc.

The study concludes that the word 'salty' is used in conjunction with various groups of words, among which the most common groups of words include:

Salty af and other variations

The abbreviation 'af' comes from the word 'as fuck', in which 'Salty af' means very salty. There are other forms of writing that convey this meaning as well to reduce vulgarity, such as salty as hell, salty as heck etc.

Salty much?

The question 'Salty much?' is an adaptation of the Internet slang question 'Jealous much?'. This Internet slang question is a rhetorical question. In the case of 'Jealous much?', if there is an answer, it can be reply with 'Much Jealous' but in the case of 'Salty much?' there is no response to the question at all.

Salty tears

The term 'Salty tears' is an internet slang term that plays on the two meanings that tears taste salty and people can feel salty through their tears. But upon an examination of the corpora of r/deadbydaylight subreddit, we found that 'Salty tears' is the name of a website that is talked about in the subreddit.

mmm (or yum) salty

The words 'mmm salty' and 'yum salty' are a play on words that can be taken with a certain flavor. From the observation, it was found that when using these words, the last letter of the word 'mmm' or 'yum' can be dragged out such as 'yummmm! salty!'
