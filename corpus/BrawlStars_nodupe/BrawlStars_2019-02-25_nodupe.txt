Yeah you could gain trophies by teaming but think from the perspective of the person who is getting teamed on and what if you end up as that person so really I think it would be better without teaminh

It can be different tasks and etc.

Well yes but actually no

Instead of geisha, why not name it kimono piper? I feel like geisha is too mature for brawlstars. The art itself though is lit.

Yes thx for finishing it

I care.

What about Nickel?

The problem with auto-aiming in the direction you are facing is if there is a target is a different direction you wouldn't shoot at it. They added auto-aim to make the game easier for beginners, so I can see how it may be confusing for them if auto-aim doesn't hit an enemy near them.
---
It could be implemented so that:
---
    if(target in sight) {
---
       auto-aim at target
---
    } else {
---
       auto-aim forward
---
    }    
---
I don't know if it would be quite that easy, but regardless it would be inconsistent and probably lead to glitches. In my opinion it is easier to just manually aim, but the idea isn't bad.
---
 
---
That is true, but I suppose if the maps were created well, every brawler could have an equal playing field.
---
"Soooo... I heard you needed some pipes cleaned, eh?"
---
If I’m not mistaken they are redoing old skins before new skins are added
---
How many?
---
Oh man, I was actually just looking at the assassin brawlers, and then was anticipating, Darryl, being something like ___ assassin, but then it said Heavyweight.  I wasn’t seeing it.  So I thought and then came up with it.
---
Wow.
---
Sniper haven
---
a metaphor for my alcoholism 
---
Nah he’s just not an a tier in gg, maybe a low b tier. 
---
At least til mid
---
if(target in sight) { auto-aim at target
---
That’s the dumbest thing I may have ever heard
---
Auto aiming pipers super
---
And not bounty???
---
I would’ve thought he got second every time but you still need at least a few 3v3 wins to unlock showdown so I have no idea.
---
Throwers would be pretty good

Jesse is good on certain brawl ball maps

Gem grab is her best mode

Exactly

Great job sir!

                         (Joke)

               Good art concept

They could do something like clash royale for example in the next update they could add a epic at the day of the update and 2-3 weeks later add a rare [kinnda mixing both types of brawler realise metods(waiting and instant launch)]

I lost 50 trophies in a row with new ricco.

You said all that I wanted to convey, thanks bud.

I think that can't possibly be an overpowered buff considering the current absolute shitty meta for Piper 
---
No its not. On my phone (galaxy s4) i cant see some of the character's aim thing. Like pam or frank. I cant see the aim thing on the ground. But at dynamike or barley its there. Colt, primo and rico has it but anything else of them doesnt have the aim thing.
---
Not really an outplay when it‘s just the broken respawn immunity saving you
---
Nop
---
did you win?

Nice meme man

One of those party blower things where you blow it and it uncoils to go straight then returns back into it's coil position.
---
Me too
---
It must be by the device
---
What do you have?
---
That would make it worse than big boxes. One big box is 3 draws for 5 tokens (0.6 draws per token), one mega box would be 10 draws for 20 tokens (0.5 draws per token)
---
At least it’s not 3 coins 
---
I don't play solos on that map, but that doesn't happen in duos
---
Better than feast or famine. 
---
Well I left sorry
---
Mega boxes aren’t that good tbh. I’ve had 9 of them and I’ve gotten nothing.

But this does go to show, Shelly's super is OP.

For me they are the same

Legendaries become available on the shop after you unlocked all the other brawlers in the game. For example after you get all the rare brawlers, mythic brawlers offers will come out on the store. 
---
Unlocking a legendary brawler is not an easy thing, I’m currently at 4780 trophies and I didn’t unlock a single legendary and personally I’ve opened tons of boxes and megaboxes. Some of my friends unlocked them even at 1000/1100 trophies, its pure luck honestly 
---
Not with that attitude.
---
Connect your supercell ID to brawlstars for your main and then on your secondary I just go to settings and click log out of your supercell ID and the game should restart and give you the option to play without it and give you your secondary. You can click log in again to access your main account again. And you can also click log out to access the secondary.

No, as in like he has 6 seperate accounts that are all maxed

---
is that supposed to ve funny?
---
i have one without the watermark. Did you read my comment?
---
It’s his khakis that hold him back. 
---
But really, he’s a support brawler, you’re probably trying to play him like bull. He doesn’t need anything other than a little more time for you to get the hang of his playstyle.

I hate this too. But I guess it’s trying to prevent ppl to jz quit the game if they feel like they are going to lose.

I tried to give him some unique colors (also a blue frog is kind of weird), but yeah, that's true

I think 10 gems would be much better.

Legendary.
---
Teamwork is the key to sucess.
---
Did that ofc.. who wouldn't do that before posting it here?
---
Overused yes, OP, no. 
---
Exp? It wasn't always 1k. It hit 1k exp per level at lvl 99. And maybe a level a day is an exaggeration, but I'm a global launch player, and I'm at lvl 100. So, you do the math. How many levels I'm at, compared to how long the games been out.
---
Not good like urs..16brawler..7800trophy..I donno the level...Got bored and deleted the game(no new brawlers lol).. Your average trophy is 420..not  good..neither bad
---
Health pin again
---
Is that really an exploit though? I see it as a pure skill😂
---
Me in the swimming pool pushing the water with my hand 
---
??? No I didn't report you what???
---
Nice 
---
Sorry cant do the math..donno the facts...you reach first 20exp levels in a day..then it gets harder..not harder but it takes time
---
The words will make you out 'n' out..
---
Jesus Christ
---
I think crow is usable in maps like this. You just have to get to the center and his poison comes in handy because it reveals enemies in bushes
---
Haha yes trying to get 10k when I had 9947 trophies and season restart was happening in an hour
---
I can understand you but I do not know this network and I have contact Supercell support and they told me to send a drawing on "reddit"
---
PS : Sorry for my English i'm French 🙂
---
10,700 ÷ 23 = 465 roughly. Not 420. Nice try tho. Also, none of my brawlers are much above 500 because I'm going for all of them being 500 before I make a full push to 600s.
---
Thank you very much.😀My english is bad,sorry.
---
When why are you in the games official subreddit?
---
Make Penny spotlight👍
---
Yeah but I've been playing for a year and 9 months, since the very beginning of beta. So I was patient and you should be too. You'll get something eventually
---
Supercell needs to give out more exclusive stuff to higher players... a skin for reaching 10k would be nice
---
Fronk
---
lol i took 10000
---
I think it looks really nice but maybe it doesn't get in the game because ist like the devil.... Do you understand what i want to say?

When you are going to do more?

Eh, your opinions is your own opinion its w.e, but at the end of the day you quit and I have one of the few known accounts over 10k below lvl 100.

M E T A M O R P H O S I S
---
bbut whatever..am just stating facts..u r playing from global..u got all brawler bot sayin some arw MAXXXX and other so good levels..p2w? who knows 
---
Epic. But I don't think they will add it if they see it since Mortis already has 3 skins unless they are willing to make this a limited time skin
---
Would Sans be okay? 
---
That's actually terrifying, I love it!
---
“I CANT EVEN TURN INTO THE FUCKING DEVILS KNIFE”
---
maybe good way...?

NEON LEON WE NEED IT
---
 Look closely. There's a little kitty hat. :) 
---
You could get it with gems and then the battle pass rewards you just enough gems for the next season 
---
Then we could just change his colors but not the animal
---
Well that’s a load of bull. It should just go away when you open the app, like in CR. 
---
Yo lo obtuve en la megacaja de los 4000 trofeos

Great!

Lol, your whole reply is just showing how stupid you are.

O can’t see penny starpower, there’s a good starpower in front of it!
---
Wow, cool!
---
 Thank you. Please look forward to future works. 
---
Maybe you would have better luck if you knew it was mythic, not mystic
---
They are still being tested, so they restricted it to 400+ to not make the servers collapse.
---
Until now i thought he had a big red nose... 
---
I don't get it...
---
yes.  He gives candy presents to good children. It's kind of creepy after I say it. 
---
I think 8 is max, never got 10 but i started 1 week before global so i haven't played for long
---
It’s only one because when he was in your shop, you probably were at 549/550. Then you maxed him during the day 
---
I decided to save all i got from about 3600 to 4000 trophies,i let my wife open them,she got Spike on the 10th or so Brawl box,and she got Leon from the 4000 mega box.
---
I don't even have a single epic,im shocked
---
Out of box thinking man..see on the front page
---
I like it but i prefer a brand new golem looking brawler

Cool thnx 👍🏻

I was about to say that

You're soul is mine🦇😎🎩

Creatures of the night
---
Just know that the best ways to spend your gems are on token doublers and event tickets(if you can get max rewards on Robo Rumble) rather than mega boxes because token doublers and tickets give you mort boxes per gem.
---
I feel u dude my friend played for two months and got two epics and a mythic. It took me a year to do that
---
Good, my max is 13:14 (glitch) and 5:59 without glitch 💪
---
Look it the better nita
---
Hiding a TNT

That matchmaking is probably the bug, it’s totally okay to get two of the same brawlers in one match

And Spile

Amazing

I just do showdown

Well, it’s not much..

Imagine having two guns and only one gun holder😂🤣😐

Great

Which program did you use to make it?

Thank you

This sucks

You are lucky! There are actually 9 rewards that are worse than this one!

However, I had thought about it, but I saw it well💪

Thank you!

Kinda like it did with gene

It would be a 80 gem skin at least

We need that

Someone teach me.

Holy crap, this is one of the best skin ideas i have ever seen!! Mortis is my favorite brawler and this type of skin matches his voice acting and just the creepiness of a clown just makes it soo much better. Love the idea!!

CROW has a PHOENIX skin.

The hat is missing.
---
Right when the bull showed up I already knew what was gonna happen LOL
---
Well genes shot doesn’t do the extra stuff if it hits someone so... 🤷🏼‍♂️
---
Why take away a small element of skill. All this would do is make it easier for people who haven’t played gene? If anything the devs should add as much as possible to increase the skill cap of brawlers because that will lead to a longer life span of the game 
---
NANI?
---
I agree about his range. I too think he needs a shorter range. But I dont think he needs a rework
---
Yeah I hate that
---
lol
---
No, buy the token doubler. (10 boxes for 50 gems)... Nevermind,buy thr 80 gems mega box, thats more worth it!
---
It's not a david shield it's a pentagram that presents satan.
---
Yeah don’t buy it then. Sorry I didn’t understand your full context but I do now. Ggs I’m pushing without max btw, these newbs could never
---
Shelly's super works wonders 
---
:) I'm obsessed with clash royale and CoC too btw. I have way too maylny supercell accounts &gt;.&gt;
---
More sour I'd say
---
u/rayharvey
---
And dynamike would be 9 even smaller cats
---
DAAMMM !!! 
---
IDK
---
I wish I was this lucky 
---
Gg! But if you’ve been playing since first day of beta, it would be more like a year and 8 months 
---
God DAMN
---
what did you use to make this?
---
I was already amazed by the play, but then I saw that this even prevented you from losing, well played!
---
TÜRKİYEM
---
I have been playing since the global release and I got Leon at 1.6K trophies. And I thought I'm unlucky
---
Holy fuck, I missed this lol
---
Rasist
---
He also has Crow
---
he uses him so that doesnt count
---
WaIt FoR fReE?!?!
---
WhAt A dEaL
---
tip from guy at 11k dont get heated over a few matches
---
Hacker
---
you guys are arguing the same point
---
I agree, his range is ridiculous.
---
He needs his hat
---
Da fudge
---
You have True, I'm so stupid 😌
---
Tbh I was hoping upgrading to level 8 nita would let me destroy boxes in 1 less hit, which has some obvious advantages...but 999 damage :(
---
I'm gettin the whole auto aim squad to 500 first lmao. And probably not before I get some of them maxed. My shelly is level 8 @460 but she's like 20 power points away from being maxed. 
---
𝑺𝑨𝑫𝑵𝑬𝑺𝑺

Congrats on only knowing how to play one game type. Stop pushing one brawler in one gametype and learn how to play the overall game. Do you even know what laning is?
---
141 coins awesome!!

u mad ?

 Just the same happened to me😂
---
It's because you're high cups.
---
There's not a lot of people online with a lot of cups.
---
Sometimes match making can take a few minutes
---
Hold my Crow
---
yeah tilted with Rico
---
No we don't
---
Nothing more satisfying than stealing win from idiotic opponents who are taunting long before the timer runs out.
---
Its in the game. Its called bounty. Minus the 5v5 part.
---
Lol this is weird and cute at the same time
---
you're at 4k chill bro
---
I was waiting for that..
---
200 IQ play
---
Sounds interesting
---
Fat healer

Great map dynamike wouldn’t be op with star power

It's terryfying...

Would u mind sharing them?

Feast or femine with super drink!!!

That's not the point, you don't need to slap "pEtITioN" on every shitty idea.
---
He replied!
---
The matrix frimo o0o
---
 Is this real?!?😂😂LOL
---
It would force you to play as destructive brawlers
---
I  don't like you any more
---
:(

One word: karma

That's me!

You love to see it

WOW I NEVER KNEW THAT THANKS FOR THE INFORMATIONS
---
Barley.!!!yummy
---
Ding ding ding!
---
Pls no. This game has existing issues. This is a flat out cash grab for a game that's already made record profits. FIX THE EXISTING GAME PLEASE! Honestly if they add this before doing anything to fix the rewards on Trophy Road I will be uninstalling. Tired of games like this. 
---
I said is early not bad, learn to read
---
What’s supercell got to do with this?
---
Why do people on this sub moan that new players get everything easy? Been playing for a week, 1800 trophies so far, no epics or legendaries, and only 1 super rare. Wish I did have this awesome new player luck. 
---

Im sorry im not gone argue with mentally handicapped individuals its pointless
---
Oh hello Ash!
---
As i said idk how it is in high rankings, but where i am, i think theyre actually op. You say that theyd be useless without that bonus speed, but i say that theyd be more difficult to use. Now, at least in my ranking, theyre easy to play and usually get a high ez winrate.
---
And yeah, checking bushes is important. But not always viable, because get in this situation: youre running away of "x" brawler. Youre half hp, and you NEED to heal. Its a difficult situation. You pass next to a bush that you didnt check bc you wanted healing, to fight the one chasing you. And boom! Bull/primo/shelly/darryl etc appears. But yeah, specially bull.
---
I think supercell should think in their entire gommunity, and fix those issues if its not too late. Hopefuly, in the future heavyweights will be viable in high ranks but not so fkin op in "low" ranks.
---
Well I don't really care about other players I want it so badly
---
Change don't to yes I want it 
---
Go to the r/Brawlstars homepage and tap those 3 dots on the top right (for mobile) and choose user flair 
---
Same dude, 2017 OB and got grow last week, also my first Legendary...
---
Good idea
---
Your soul is mine
---
Played since global launch. Reached 8000 yesterday and I don't know what to do now.
---
I have 18 brawlers and pushing all of them to 500 for 9k mega box doesn't look appealing to me.
---
never ever waste time there.Get the hell out to the middle if you are a squishy guy.
---
Ok, I believe you. I really don't get why so many randoms throw games like that.
---
I hope i do... :(
---
Remember: don't team at all if you want to make showdown great again
---
Looks amazing, current one isnt really good 
---
No wonder why i can see 7  or 8 throwers spinning on skull creek and cavern churn
---
Rocket rain!!!!! 
---
Fake, if your heart would actually stop you would have been dead!! 
---
No please God no! This is a terrible idea. 
---
Love it

Inner peace.

First of all, I'm terrible artist and my English is below bad. But despite that, I really want to introduce you my concept of a brawler. I've named him Octo(Okto), because, you know, he is an octopus (with cool cybernetic tentacles, by the way!). His play/battle style is quite like hunter - seeks his enemies with main attack, slow them down and make them visible in the bushes with his super. Detailed charecteristics:
---
×Hp: Lvl1 - 3200, Max - 4480
---
×Speed: 720 (basic)
---
×Attack: Bullets per Attack - 3 
---
   Range - 10, 7.5, 5
---
   Reload - 2 seconds
---
   Damage - Lvl1 - 360 per tentacle (1080), Max - 504 per tantacle (1512) 
---
×Super: Range - 10 
---
   Duration - 8 seconds
---
   Damage - 0
---
  Main Attack:
---
Octo's attack is the three tantacles thrown by him on the enemies. Each deal equal piercing damage with different range. Tentacles that have hit the wall will reflect to the nearest enemy brawler on the other side of that wall (they can reflect only one time). Also reflected tentacles will not have any boost to damage or range, etc. This ability will help him with seeking his enemies out and dealing a lot of damage upclose and, especially, in the areas surrounded by walls. It will let him deal damage (at Max) equal to 3024! (without considering piercing).
---
  Super Attack:
---
He fires a hook or cling that looks like a robotic arm/palm from his tentacle that clings to the enemy brawler. This sort of a hook interferes it's carrier to walk normally and sends a signal about his location to the Octo. It deals no damage, but decreases movement speed by 50 and makes his victim visible(only to him!) in the bushes from any range. This also will go through any non-brawler enemy, like turret or box. 
---
  Star Power:
---
When the duration of "palm" passes or his carrier has died it will try to cling to the next target in the radius of 5. When it switched to the next enemy brawler the duration will be decreased for 2.5 seconds. So the chain will include 8 seconds target, 5.5 seconds target and 2 seconds target. It will make him more versatile in team events. 
---
  Conclusion and even more detailes:
---
This character went to the paper and text straight from my mind, so if you have seen something very similar to "Octo/Okto Brawler Concept" it is may be caused by my newness to Reddit. If you have any better idea about this character or you think he is too OP, please leave a comment below. If you like it please upvote this post, because this concept took a lot of time to represent it to you in the most clear form. In the end, I wish you luck and joy in the Brawl Stars and your life. Peace✌️

Puppets 
---
My theory is that most randoms are working for Supercell, and they mess games up to slow down progression (specially the primos)
---
IM MORTIFIED
---
I whould give you gold if i had it
---
Lol nice. So true
---
I mean as far as we know, he mentioned the word "teaming" not "mess around". So it seems highly plausible that he teamed on the first place before getting to his position.
---
Mortis gang. Creatures of the night 🎩🦇
---
Which fucking Christmas lmao, game's been out for 2 years in beta
---
Jessie the nazi destoryer 
---
I really like the old puppy turet its cute
---
the first one she killed missed every attack.
---
Great I got 2 dislikes, it was a joke people
---
make a big box there.
---
No it won't. It's just more crap. Cosmetics? Cool useless after you stop playing so a complete waste of money. Emotes? See previous reasons why they are crap. Boosts? What are they boosting gold, power points? Because we don't need boosts we need better trophy road rewards. Everything they're talking about is worthless in game items. We need more content for end game. Most players at my level are bored because the rest of the game is just waiting for loot boxes. Battle Pass is a way to fix issues they created by forcing everything to be locked behind loot boxes.
---
How can you underestimate the defoult puppy turet you momster
---
Ooo a leon and mortis fan. Nice👌👌👌
---
The ones that bother me make them lel :)
---
jim.com
---
Shelly!
---
U know what, i opened my 1000 trophies friend’s COMMON CHEST… and got Leon. He already has 1 mythic, 1 epic and 1 legendary, and i don’t have any of them
---
Nooooo
---
First day of beta no legendary 
---
What? You should expect a heavy dose of bull and Shelly on what I’m guessing feast or famine 
---
Yeah he cant have been playing daily
---
Fek off
---
Those I did not made them because I did not go haha :)
---
How can I get it?
---
Money. I don’t want to directly say it or I’ll get banned 
---
Thx
---
22 gems!!!!
---
Gonna open those 16 boxes?
---
Thanks. Didn't think so but that's a lotta damage! Lol
---
I see primo and bull in your future 
---
Oh yea but in the end it would only hurt
---
Fantastic!!! Where have make it? I hope that Supercell will insert your skin in the game
---
🤣
---
This skin should be for Jessie!!!
---
i am a master with microsoft paint as you can see by the wonderful drawings
---
This is amazing! Sold!
---
Oh, yes thank you.
---
I was thinking about Penny Musketeer skin, when I clicked on your profile and then...
---
Ha. You stand no chsnce to my no coin
---
Fire map!
---
It must feel like that because my own Bull/Primo destroy my ass with the goddamn coins.
---
Well done map my guy. Upvoted for sure. 
---
Ya I just had that feeling usually I record when I have 10+ boxes 
---
That spelling though ;)
---
Show us your brawler list
---
I don’t use el primo or waste my gold on him... I could get him to max level but I don’t choose to do that with my gold
---
Gem grab is trash, not even worth playing for the Star Token IMO because it’s pretty much a 50/50 chance you’re going to win or lose a match
---

Mildly annoyed that you didn’t let the music finish
---
Remember, don't team.
---
Yeah its true what you say but that can be an big improvement in the game because i am sick of all these teamers and i know that i am not the only one 🤗
---
the spawns at the top and bottom are wayyyy too close
---
This map would be great to a RR map
---
I thought we already established his other gun goes in his gun wait wtf is going on oh fuck oh shit
---
d e a d   m e m e
---
Frank*ly*, I agree. He's a "hit or miss" guy. He either works or he doesn't. 
---
Amazing! Excellent editing, and the ideas are great!
---
The only thing I disagree with is including kills-deaths-assists. Many people have mentioned this before: If you put KDA, then some players might become more focused on kills than winning, e.g. they would rush the enemy to get kills even if they have the ball/gems. It might dilute the team-based aspect of the game for some players.
---
But overall I think this is an awesome end screen! The only thing I don't see is where it displays the check/X if they want to play again or not.
---
Absolutely nothing... This is just how mortis players work
---
It is "easier" to team with a barley then for example a bull. You also see a lot of barley/dynamike teams, so you could argue that this is a way people play it. But I am just as buthurt as most people about teaming so I don't promote it...
---
Good Game!
---
Damn. That's so true
---
Thats why they have rank17 bull and shelly and rank 6 rico...no skill 😂
---
Force Bull to only spawn in the middle
---
This is what true mortis see💯💯💯
---
Just luck I think. I got Poco and Crow in the same box.
---
MEHA has been noted
---
supercell will sue supercell for this
---
Yesssss sir
---
Fuck if I know if this is original. I just wanted to make something stupider than I am. 
---
How is this amazing, the Poco was just throwing lol
---
Thank you for your comments, I'll try to do that. 👍
---
I don't see how it makes it easier, though. These balances would be exactly the same if they were still a quarter of what they are now. (They multiplied by 4)

I know thats from the brawl stars animation kinda songs created back in 2017 and removed from their channel...
---
Becuase if they want like 20 dmg off, it's easier
---
Clash Royale may take longer to max out but at least I had every card unlocked  within a year and got to play them in challenges and tournaments had a lot of fun trying new things.
---
I can't say that about Brawl Stars 1.2 years and still missing Frank + mythics and 2 legendaries. Not being able to try new things in a long time takes all the fun out of me.

Yes I hope they make it as a skin...same for dyna and brock...I hate these new models...

Where??

It's almost like duo showdown is now a thing, oh wait, it already is. stopthespin

Geez this is unsettling

I would main the hell out of the skin
---
I mean if she got that +4 you bet your ass you dead
---
Ok thanks 
---
The corner has a 2 by 2 square, Tara max star orthrowing an object(except penny cannon)
---
Same as primo in away
---
The ball goes faster and farther. It doesn't pass through enemies though, that'd be too OP.
---

I don’t have anything else to say besides one last thing:
---
Holy Crow
---
Nightmare Fuel
---
Can you do this in Blender tho? 
---
Jessie left the lobby, as you can notice at the bottom where the jessie player's name has a cross behind it.
---
Bet
---
Yeah, i feel exactly the same
---
Ah I see, thank you. 
---
 they're both equal to 10 brawl boxes but the token doubler costs one more gem 
---
Gotcha thanks 
---
This was just a standard 2v2 with power drinks honestly gave up when I saw it 
---
Made using Mordeus' Brawl Craft:

Wow. You just destroyed my point. Nr.1: You don't know about my knowledge of wrestling. Nr. 2: My point was that a King wouldn't do something like wrestling. Nr3: What's the point of pointing out my spelling mistake? It didn't cheapen my argument. The letter C is stupid anyway. Don't be so toxic. 
---
I think you just change that slot based on what mode you're playing. Gem grab: make it "gems held" or "gems stolen" would be cool. Heist: damage done. Brawl ball: scores.  Bounty: k/d/a. Etc.
---
That would promote playing to the objective for whatever mode it is.
---
I read this as it would say ellllll primooooo and it made it 20 times more funny
---
It's so perfect good joob 👍
---
Darryl for the Win
---
*sees gem dissapear into midair* "wait...what?
---
Doing this with Shelly is a lot of fun
---
Bounty is usually good for Piper 
---
Sans 
---
Finally! Someone with a great idea! 
---
Yes pls
---
I received one of those too. I got nine gems. (Ils me donnaient un cadeau aussi. J’ai reçu neuf gemmes.) Thanks (Merci) Supercell!
---
it's because you were playing against top global players. 
---
Come on, it's one game. the guy just wanted to help them push. 
---
it takes top global players 30 some minutes to find a match.
---
The only good type of teaming is when the group has a low amount of power cubes and there’s a way more powerful enemy that needs to be addressed first. But for me, once that enemy is killed, the alliance is immediately broken
---
He be like #f2pbtw
---
Wooooah 1 token ! Xd
---
Yes I have got 7 gemmes me but, why?
---
But he’s fine as it is. I don’t think he needs a buff. Just gotta play him carefully.
---
Hide in the bushes long enough. Any1 can win
---
It's true
---
Default Dance
---
That's tough
---
However, if it’s just two of us teaming and that guy has a little bit of health after the fight with the powerhouse, I’ll run away and let them heal up. It’s only fair
---
Nope
---
his bottles last 2 seconds on ground . one on one fights are not his thing . he can do area denial very well but other teammates have to take advantage of it.
---

Haha, you say that because you aven't got leon but this is so hard to play him now, everybody can kill him

Jesus that's terrifying
---
Nice Try

Wow...Just wow

I am sorry for you but my legendary chance is about a fifth of yours

Umm wheres the iq mike?
---
Crow is useless. Literally lost 80 trophies in 1 sitting
---
I apologise....it’s a lovely meme! 👍🏻 especially if it gets Crow a buff!
---
Thanks for the support

Oui c'est le gemme pour ceux qui ont ouvert des box a partir du shop pendant que d'honneur était retirer du jeu 
---
i released a small amount of air from my nostrils
---
What if they just sat on the map, like little tombstones! That would be cool. 
---
Yessir
---
I LOVE your work man,very great details!
---
Jessie evolves into Pam
---
I love you both
---
Trust me crow is useless. Was my highest brawler at 480 and guess what? Played a few matches with pros but also against pros and down to 406...
---
Then explain why you can see the dynamike in the bush. Come on

Hahahahahahahahahahahahahha🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣
