Reminds me of ig-88 from Star Wars, very nice!

I know his overall health while engaging is lower, but I like the current Darryl than the old Darryl(last patch). That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs a buff for me, you can‚Äôt really say it‚Äôs a *nerf*, they shifted the power in his SP blah blah blah you get it, as I said, by the way I play I prefer having higher base health than shield power.
---
Just 1420 regular boxes. You‚Äôd probably pull 1 but not 2.
---
Ooo do Darryl next
---
I think it looks meh but I don‚Äôt think it needs to change. The one that OP proposed actually looks kinda dope though.
---
I'm Bull. (I live in Finland)

Your on that fan fiction shit m8
---
That's what the key points are for ;)
---
Haha thank you
---
I think it's meant to try and read Brawler movement ie strafes and retreating
---
Her turret fires a barrage of bombs when destroyed. It used to fire the barrage of bombs in random directions, but the most recent update made her turret target the barrage at opponents when destroyed. Now it‚Äôs too powerful, especially in siege and heist. She was already powerful in siege, now it‚Äôs just dumb.
---
poco is okay, he‚Äôs in an *OKAY* spot... but he‚Äôs easily replaceable and he‚Äôs not the best option (like pam, who is very much better than him) poco needs a buff to push him back into the meta a little bit, he‚Äôs a one trick pony
---
Bibi
---
CoC is more competitive, has more longevity, more things to do, more social things to do, it‚Äôs easier to upgrade and progress, and isn‚Äôt luck based. 
---

---
CoC is better than brawl stars.

He really doesn't need a buff though? I'm at 7000 trophies and he is the only Brawler i have at 500 trophies. I have pushed him mostly on Gem Grab and Brawl Ball, he also works on Duo Showdown. He is good right now.
---
WTF IS THIS POCO!
---
FBI OPEN UP
---
I have him at 500 too, he is really good.

Now you got the buff ahah enjoy

Under 200 trophies anything is possible
---
I approve as a TF2 player

Mortis is all but useless as a teammate at everything but high trophies except for sometimes brawl ball. I don‚Äôt play him and probably wouldn‚Äôt even if he got buffed. I just want competent teammates.

Nothing has changed on her for a long time. Is this a troll post? Everyone hated on her star, and she used to be my fav, but now its OP? I'm so confused.
---
*I swear if nita isn't next*
---
Also keep the awesome drawing :)
---
"Hone that form to get you ready for the big fight"

dance my puppets dance!
---
They nerfed Rosa the next business day after her release.
---
yea makes more sense than cloyster. still amazing art tho
---
I'm equalising all my brawlers to level (priority to higher trophy brawlers, Max is lvl 8 Shelly with upgrade available for 7). I've read that once you hit level 9 your chances of legendary go down as you can get star power from boxes. So, if you haven unlocked all brawlers is this a good idea?
---
Where the fuck are the gems?
---
The same happened to Crow and it made zero difference, so then they gave him another buff on top of it.
---
You mean the brawler that broke thier game Cause no one could kill her?
---
preach
---
Same here. Relax we'll get there
---
Nita power lvl 10 ptw confirmed
---
Sorry for the confusion but yeah this is what I meant
---
And They are correct, luck can make anyone look good...
---
Wait, so if you get star power they become level 10?
---
math 100
---
It isn't about me. It's about the killer mortar 6 shot bomb at the end.
---
I know
---
Lol and he dies
---
At least I‚Äôm not the only one that thought this
---
Im sorry. But the guy on the right is the only one who deserves to get to play her. Limited skins op. Reindeer nita is best nita.
---
IDK I got Jessie's pretty fast from a box. I think it might be the same difficulty as getting the brawler itself so rarer ones take longer to drop.
---
I love what you‚Äôre doing, keep it up !! Bo as a Pok√©mon trainer would be interesting ü§î

But whats stopping someone like a rosa or a primo from just rushing you. And about being a tank, I never said he was and I said that you could also run away but you just forgot that I guess

Rosa and Primo are Tanks dude, they can rush anyone. I'm not gonna continue this argument, it's pointless

Supercell said they want their game to be as simple as possible. I guess they gave round numbers to stay consistent with this idea.

Maybe after seeing this post they could change their mind for darryl..

I do think that the beer on the bottle would fall off so it would do 0 damage

---
My eyes hurts...
---
Why?
---
I feel like Mortis is only useful at lvl 9 with SP. They take out brawlers so easily, and can survive decently. Other than that level, my Mortis always fall shorts of one extra shot to kill the enemy before I die, due to not having enough charge or SP.
---
Or I'm wrong?

I want it.

Where is the download option

Yeah, that‚Äôs why I play Rico on that map

Wow forget about the gold, this is better ü§©

But they buffed Penny's sttar power and it is good!

Jesse would have Electric type Pokemon
---
casual mortis is amazing
---
Another Rosa nerf? I know she was really OP at launch but it feels like she‚Äôs getting a bit gutted now. Thoughts?

One thing that would make mortis better is to reduce the delays between his attacks and super and reverting the reload speed buff
---
Musical mayhem!

---
Hi worst brawler
---
Okay so the way to figure it out is this:
---
coin doublers are 5 gems per box
---
buying 60 tickets has a value of a bit more than 4 gems per box
---
and this has a value of 89(cost)/20(brawl box value) this gets you to 4.9 gems per box. NOT WORTH IT.  Buying tickets and getting 32 each time in RR is significantly better.
---
One offer you should always look out for is the 1000 coin doublers for 29 gems. This has a value of 2.9 gems per box which is definitely hard to beat. Imo, just make sure that its better than 4 gems per box to make it worth it.
---
Ik I got most of mine from boxes but you should look at the reply I sent someone higher up on this post... I have major bad luck.
---
Temple ruins in beta
---
EVERYONE IS SAYING ITS WORTH IT BUT IT ISNT. If you already bought it then dont worry it isnt a terrible trade (its only a bit better than buying 50 gem coin doublers)

---
I see this more as a rebalancing than as a buff/nerf tbh, imo Darryl is the worst brawler without his star power and this makes him better pre star power while making his star power a little bit less annoying, as he could just roll into you and facetank everything, so there wasn‚Äôt really much counterplay.

Take my upvote. Also, they're called "brawler lore" apparently.

I'm gonna disagree with this. 1:shelly can't be as annoying. 2:shes not a healer3:she can be used for offense or defense but poco is a support brawler kinda like crow and gene. Stay in the back, charge up ur super and be super annoying

What?

5 seconds later respawn to base and  you rush to the enemy base while El primo is waiting for the game to be over 10 seconds later El primo bot is here

But you also never said someone else drew that.

Brawl ball works very well. I got mine to 300 trophies at power 1 with brawl ball. Use him on maps where theres a lot of tanks cuz he shreds them.

Crow doesn‚Äôt do big damage? Tru, that‚Äôs why he has poison, to dick people off. Mortis? Fucking run at enemies and just die while doing only 1000+ damage

This is actually good, needs more upvotes, as a matter of fact, see you at the top

When did they confirmed it? If so then i am excited about the brawl talk, its about time üòÅ

Same tho
---
Excuse me? Half the brawlers? He can only 3 shot 5 brawlers (Spike, Rico, Crow, Piper, and Barley)
---
Oh definitely. Its just extremely discouraging to play against/with all star power people when I dont want to spend money on the game.
---
i really never wanna see poco without a hat ever again
---
Very good!
---
I like you too
---
o hi üëÄ
---
Well, he is viable in Gem Grab and that‚Äôs about it. While he can be useful in brawl ball and duo sad as you said, most of the time his low damage output and heal don‚Äôt change that much. I don‚Äôt get why people think he is viable in showdown. Every time I play with a Poco in brawl ball I end up loosing since a tank scores through Poco.
---
Good job! You‚Äôre the 5%.

i'll try too

ok thx

Maybe decrease the last blast dmg not amount of shots or make the cannon when target one thing while doing the last blast but it‚Äôs shoots in an 5 shots at the same time in an x shape to prevent the enemy from moving anywhere

Very good question, I never though of that. I'm guessing it would make the most sense for him to teleport to whichever side of the water he is closest to.
---
This creature of the night is a disgrace to the Mortis gang.

But your an unskilled bastard. Haven't you seen the YouTubers that have a level one account and push to 500. You are so unskilled swine and you probably asked for a mortis buff.

Keep your salty out they play the game since day one and they ARE more skilled than me, but why i am unskilled? Because i am complaining about something not fair? Probably you are far stronger than me or maybe not but this doesn't allow you to say "you are such an unskilled bastard". Ah and the youtubers that you are talkin about have almost all of their brawlers at rank 20, at least in their main account, so get quiet kid because i don't want to argue on some sh*t like this

Fun fact, I am the highest rated non-beta player in Denmark. The chance of teaming in my map, is less than regular showdown maps, duo to the sheer advantages in various biomes. So it makes no sense to team with a close ranged, for a brock in the upper left corner for instance. The general inconsistencies are no more than that of the current showdown maps, they also have various parts where you are at a disadvantage, or people start uneven, which gives others an unfair edge. The fact that box spawn rates are random, shows that they do embrace the RNG element, because it's unpredictable and forces the player to adapt. Now, the good thing about my map, is that this RNG is very visible, and the decisionmaking is more crucial here because of it. The added high-risk corners adds to that effect. I have to disagree with you, but do appreciate your comment. :)

Please make it.

Using bull not in a bush
---
What about modern type of skins
---
Been getting pretty good randoms since I've gotten to 8k trophies.
---
Disgusting the amount of people ganging up on you tho
---
I bought that offer and got Darryl and Bibi
---
I actually really like that
---
Same shit.
---
Dyna=Powercube,Powercube=Dyna.
---
She sucks until you hit your star power. She's my only brawler left below 200 trophies because I can't stand playing as her, she does no damage
---
Randoms with 7k trophies and above are bit better. Even then you find noobs who keep using auto aim
---
You should play rico if you have him
---
He‚Äôs my only rank 15
---
The thing is, which brawlers are great on this map? Double Trouble is for snipers, Skull Creek for throwers, your map doesn‚Äôt have ‚Äòbest‚Äô brawlers for the map, and that makes trophy pushing on it incosistent.
---
I got gene when he was just op
---
One word: ^
---
A reason you don‚Äôt have a rank 15 may be that you enjoy playing more than 1 character
---
Oi maybe not stoopid
---
I do enjoy playing with more brawlers. Now I am trying to get Bo. But hopes for me to get a legendary this summer
---
Please post new map ideas in the r/Brawlmaps subreddit. Thanks! By the way, one-block-spaces are very hard for brawlers to get through so they are normally not included in any maps. Thanks for your ideas though!
---
SCP containment breach
---
I love the look of it, but playing on it wouldn‚Äôt be fun, it is so small, I guess it‚Äôs my opinion though, I prefer long range showdown maps :p.
---
I started to find good mates at 400 brawler trophies, but sometimes the sinergy is not good
---
How many trophies do you have, I am non-beta as well and I am currently at 10,5k.
---
Dang, I am only at 1K :(
---
Wish me luck then
---
Exactly! The skill cap of my map, is way higher than the current showdown maps, but it is also more fair, due to less teaming and meta. At trophy ranges below 400, it is just pure fun, as people would lack decision making, and just roam the different biomes to the best of their ability.

No wrong post go to Bull gang
---
It‚Äôs scary how perfect this representation is
---
No....
---
Shelly got it
---
happens to me too man
---
r/beatmeattoit
---
I wouldn‚Äôt say it is skill cap, the RNG removes the ‚Äòskill cap-reward-rate‚Äô
---
Please post all new map ideas in the r/Brawlmaps subreddit. Thanks!
---
Youre supposed to reply to a comment by clicking reply, not making an entirely new comment. Just some advice
---
Of course it has a higher skill cap, if the brawler pool is higher, and the decisionmaking is more crusial.
---
Didnt realize you didnt do the art at first, but it was pleasingly humorous to see "Art" cropped out
---
Ok, sorry im new :/
---
Cloyster really fits her
---
I use seige as Mortis only, so I can carry just in case I get bad teammates
---
Nope they simply got a 150 gems skin instead of a random recolor, no complains here about that
---
-White Crow raided the chat-
---
The mortars name is karl the canon in (german)
---
Was about to downvote, then I read the username
---
Yes, I lost 30 gem for another skin
---
Yup, that's right :P
---
"New"
---
This is one of the oldest and most frequently-repeated ideas on this sub. It's just so obvious that I don't know why it hasn't been added yet.
---
But your art and map design are awesome!
---
Also, IMO they should remove event modifiers from Showdown and add a "Showdown with modifiers" gamemode that rotates in with Duel. This would give us more Showdown gamemode options and also allow them to bring back Life Leech.
---
How (where) do you edit all your posts?
---
Why are you stupid
---
Pretty much, but you got more value in the end
---
If you mean by make my post then with the paint.net
---
Well, maybe not so hard, but it changes a lot when u have bonus healing from star power of Pam and Poco, and get 2600 per shoot from Piper in bush
---
But if you dont want this skin, you want your gem back for another skin, right ?
---
Do you even listen what i said?
---
This took forever hope it doesn‚Äôt get lost in new
---
That's fair, it's what I expected too
---
Any request for another brawler?
---
But if you dont want this load rico skin, you may prefere to get yourngem back for new otjer skin right ?
---
Yup, they weren't that good, they made a mistake there and there, but still they did good job
---
A good job is a win
---
And Pam like: Come on, we can do this!
---
Yep, but I meant in my post that I have won with cancer matchmaking (u know what I mean, matching normal players with P2W players)
---
Imagine spawning  in el salvador as a piper lol
---
*cough* ...Canon... *cough*
---
Removed - DO NOT SUBMIT POSTS WITH TITLES IN ALL CAPS. CAPS LOCK IS CRUISE CONTROL FOR COOL
---
Fighter has a good balance between hp and dps?
---
Rosa: *whistling*
---
How about gaining double the amount you lost by doubling your spin rate
---
What a tip bro thxüòÇ
---
I got Leon from one of those blue ones
---
Darryl rolling is just him spinning sideqays
---
Honestly looks like he comes from a nursery rhyme on youtube
---
No prob any time
---
does 3/4 of damage to enemies and then heals himself and teammates and then kills the rest of your team is semi broken
---
RYAN!!!
---
*oh yes jessie squeeze harder*
---
save ryan
---
Love this idea
---
Oppening
---
it's cool, when my friend and I want to play 1 vs 1 we have to kill bots to play normally
---
POCOS STAR POWER SHOULD BE REGULAR POCO. NEW STAR POWER MAKE HIM HEAL HIMSELF BY X AMOUNT WHENEVER HE ATTACKS
---
Yes
---
