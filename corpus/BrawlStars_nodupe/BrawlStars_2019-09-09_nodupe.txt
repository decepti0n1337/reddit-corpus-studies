Yeah this has been happening to me as well. Weird bug.

One thing to note: That‚Äôs MY 8-Bit, who happens to not have any star powers. So 1UP can not save him nowüò¢

Thanks bruh! First time!

u so funny

Honestly can you just shut up, no one really cares and you‚Äôre just kinda annoying, like that one kid no one wanted to talk to

Are you retarded, or just a 9 year old trying to act smart

The game needs more gold since there are more brawlers in the game
---
that was a fuckin sweet last snipe
---
yep
---
Pls make sure to make Leon a guy cause he‚Äôs a guy in game and they‚Äôre Nita brother so maybe make it like they playing in a field idk something I think it would be cool

Different Poses you say üòè

All this did was remind me that I have nobody to play duo with and I played duo with randoms to reach almost 13k trophies :(.

My favorite brawler is FRANK. His attack is OP and receives his Super quickly because of his fast attack recharge.

aimbot should be something like 
---
when 8 bit is still, he will charge a gauge for 5 seconds, after then, the next shots will do 30% more damage
---
Aimbot and Critical hit are good, but flashbang seems kinda broken. Damage booster is pretty passive and not too game changing because 8bits base attack and stats are so strong.
---
 My favourite brawler  Spike

Aww man

I wouldn‚Äôt call it pain. You have all 3 legendaries lol. 8k here with no mythics or legendaries and only 2 epics.

No I bought the offer last season and this one too.
---
Either it's coming later for you guys (a matter of hours/minutes), or the offer is randomized (like star powers in the shop)
---
 Could be inactive
---
Yeah, maybe also Piper with Snappy Sniping could be a good choice now, but I've never tried. Yde cleared Insane XVI with Pam, Bull and Carl, blocking the boss near a wall and spamming with Carl's attack, Pam helping him with the turret and Bull staying far avoiding the rockets and killing some bots.
---
Which is why I made the post
---
Actually one more question. Did you ever go on long losing streaks? If so was there anything you did about them?
---
Yeah imma have to a agree here. The remodel is fine. The icon is not whatsoever. Its like she got sucker punched in the face and lost all her teeth.

But what if I don‚Äôt want that

I personally save my star points for skins. I think the effort to get the star point vs what a mega box costs, it is not worth

Oh, thanks for telling me.. I literally just got piper 550 right after the season ended... The irony

killing rosa and pam as mortis rank 50
---
Why is that?
---
I did, I was on a long losing streak but that was before the trophies system update, when I was on losing streak I took a break for a couple of days, and after that I got back my trophies.
---
It was my bad I didn't know they have to be 550.. I had piper 447 and today I got her 550, the irony..

Thanks for telling me

I have been getting this too but just shrugged it off as fat fingering or something.

No prob you‚Äôre the won doing the amazing work

Yeah ex-president promoted me and left by saying that he doesn't want to take all the president role burden and i want to play as a average brawl stars player.Today i even managed to make contact with the ex-president of our club and brought him back to his club once and for all.

Yeah that was luckily a happy ending after all and we all are reunited together as one family.If u are intrested in joining our club then u can join freely.
---
Oh sorry, I thought it said my first brawler
---
No problem bro.
---
I got all 3 and i disagree maxed at 7k and i know by experience
---
For a second I thought the title was "short crappy animation" and I was confused
---
I'll think about it, my trophies are kinda low tho so I'll farm up first and consider it once I'm ready
---
I wish I get one too I'm at 15k, dropped to 13k today

Looks familiar but I don‚Äôt know what

my friend got bibi from big box and piper from mega box from the season end offer it is extra stonks for him he is at 7.1k

And yes, im saying it's a good animation you made

Well u can join our club if u have more than 6000 trophies.

piper's 3 seconds in the air is a big deal too dude. It's supposed to be useful.

And bro... It's a video game. Not much of it makes sense. Like how does piper get in the air, how does leon go invisible, how does spike throw a non-existent cactus grenade?

Im reporting this due to breaking one of the rules of this subreddit. "All content must be related to Brawl Stars"
---
I won Shark Leon too!
---
Nice idea I like it!
---
Well that's unfortunate üòÖ but still possible to reach 8k or 9k without any problem. Just add 400~500 trophies to that "no prob cap" per brawler you get from now on. You'll eventually get every single one except for legendaries which are just dumb luck you get when you expect it the less (I got Spike in beta 1500 trophies, and Crow in the day that Gene got released, in the second box I saved up for Gene lmao, and since I got the actual Gene 5 days later, I haven't obtained a single brawler via Brawl/Big/Mega Boxes), so the only remaining brawler I have is Leon. Got 13200 trophies rn so just be patient and try to grind little by little, so good luck üòâ
---
No . Big boxes are absolutely not worth it

Oh i forgot since i never see the damn skin

So cool

How is this him missing the joke at all?

Up to 850 on heist with first star power. Then showdown til 1k with extra life

Im really sorry i was sure ill get my 2nd mythic not my 2nd legendary

But what about reload speed
---
Look at the art style hence the title
---
Piper wants to know your location
---
everyone gangsta until shelly charges up her super.

Is the skin already available in the shop? Cuz it never appeared to me. Is it like ‚Äúpremium‚Äù or im just unlucky?

Lol i got 1020 last season now i got 2050

Damm I‚Äôm at 11.703k to 11.443k

A megabox counts as 10 normal boxes, the legendary percentage scales with that too.
---
You literally tagged me. How could you not expect to see me?
---
I also thought you'd have figured out by now that I don't really care about that.
---
Don't whine so much, 100 trophies isn't that bad amount if trophies to lose :/

no. have some restraint.  big box gives 3 boxes for 500 whereas mega gives 10 for 1500. mega has better value.

It gives you more than the trophies removes... and you can use the star points for in game content... but nobody will ever be satisfied. It‚Äôs easier just to complain.

Imagine the reset of players at +20k

Im at 12.5k and every time I request a play people rejects, what you consider me then?

Yeah maybe you can do it for low trophies noobs but if you actually learn to play brawl ball you would actually know to Never autoaim when at your goal cos u might own goal üòëüòë

I would start to play again if this is gonna happen

Bruh

But what if I don't have crow

Thanks!

It reset ypur Tara to 725, but you got the 220 SP's for getting her into the 750 trophy range.  The way they show it is deceiving.

If AFK-ers don‚Äôt turn off their phone, the game can‚Äôt see they are AFK, it costs like 20 seconds to disconnect AFK players from the game.
---
In this game, 20 seconds can mean the difference between losing or winning.
---
(I can be wrong, correct me if so)
---
220 star points is exactly what you should get for a brawler between 750-799 trophies. Check the Season End Star Points rewards table in game
---
i want
---
Oh ok thank you

*slap* STOP TOUCHIN' DA CHILD
---
Is..is..that a refrence to the sonic trailer?
---
You should make it every shot.
---
Penny's cannon doesn't hit accurately, and even when it does, assuming that the 1 in 10 balance is complete, you would get an entire second of stun. A stun about as long as Bibi's charged hits.
---
Basically your star power although well thought and cool. In theory, it feels as underpowered as old Last Blast.
---
Tick is quite good in Brawl ball tbh, but that's your opinion so ok
---
everybody gangsta til the plant starts walking
---
In addition, every point captured by each team automatically becomes a unlocked spawning point, with brawlers spawning in the point closest to the cart
---
God
---
Wait barbecue?
---
I bought it but i have alot of gems how many do you have?
---
save up gems and buy from shop. sometimes 349 gem offer appears in shop.took me 7 months , you can do same.
---
ok, it just looked confusing that I got 220 for 625 when it looked like I should‚Äôve gotten double for 751
---
Why would it be a waste? The legendary chance increases quicker when opening megaboxes than with normal or big boxes.

right thats the first thing i thought

Yeah but if you have a high chance, it means u haven‚Äôt unlocked a brawler in a long time, I literally had no new brawler other than trophy road in 5 months

They are retarded lmao.
---
It‚Äôs cool, but I feel like brawlstars is one of the least fit types of games for a payload mode
---
Where is Supercell located that has weekends on Monday?
---
Don‚Äôt talk about winning the skin, I have yet to  even encounter a shark Leon in game :( If I ever see him before Friday, I will take it as a lucky omen
---
ok what the fuck
---
oh and you must be very strong in order to make her pregnant 15 times
---
Well now I'm wishing I had waited to play boss fight! :|
---
r/lootstars
---
Why did you ignore the chat bubbles at the bottom
---
I think they count the end of the weekend as when he ticketed events end
---
Same
---
This is sooooooooooooo sad
---
Hard to betray Rosa or Bull as Mortis though-
---
Oh btw I can show you I got leon from that box, rn he is at 10 trophies
---
doesn't either. It works on any other mode. The explanation says "target" not "brawler". It works on IKE in siege and base in heist.
---
open brawler profile ,click on trophy level of any bralwer.
---
Leon from big box (i did a 15 brawl boxs opening and 2 big boxs) i had like 4.7k trophies lol
---
I can play baby shark on the piano, is that ok?
---
lmao
---
me2 high5
---
 My favorite brawler is Rosa and my player tag is #2V2VCJ09
---
Yeah, it's so weird.
---
I hope that any youtuber reviews that :p
---
No but I know the month when I started this game , because that day my friend's birthday party was there and my friend told me to play this game and I liked it still now and I am happy that supercell are improving this game but I dont know when they will improve matchmaking.By the way I started this game in December last year because I remember that after 2days of playing this game ,a new update has arrived in which Leon was new brawler so u can understand when is date.
---
Finally a high effort work,thank you!
---
Kinda strange but it looks cool
---
At this point they just want my damn money and if i can i will surely do give them some
---
So tokens will be considered doubles through the week or just this weekend?
---
Bro thats so rude:( im sorry for you
---
Thanks for the advice
---
Mortis have coiled snake ready!
---
&gt;Another thing that can improve, too, are the rewards, you should increase,  
---
They did increase them, by a large amount.
---
I didn‚Äôt even try since I knew I won‚Äôt get him, sooo :(
---
Nsfw
---
kinda late but i like me that puffy gene boi

I hope that any youtuber reviews that ;-; :p
---
You have the mega chest. Also this is a big box.
---
Your mega chest only has the gun and hand and arms ....no 8-bit facial features...seems a little off.
---
Still ...it's clean and very nice.
---
If you were the first to post this ...I honestly didn't know.
---
Great idea , I just thought of it literally today , that's why I date some of my drawings.
---
Not to mention I did it by hand and not computer.
---
IF this would make it into the game, would you like it to be bought for gems or for starpoints?
---
I don't have a legendary üòêüòêüòêüò≠üò≠
---
Thx!!!
---
Can he run half life?
---
Requiers
---
And 1up, that's kinda OP-ier than band aid.
---
Amazing work!
---
Thx!!
---
Why did u down vote if ur name is litearlly icehot
---
Nah ...two completely different renders.
---
Yours is nice , but not the exact same drawing.
---
I can see you reversed the image of 8-bit and then overlayed an image of a mega chest on top and then manipulate it to fit across his body properly.
---
Nice work though.
---
100 trophies is nothing. Also, you just need to start actually pushing and take advantage of the new system. I didn't get all my brawlers to 550, but I had 18. So I got 1260 star points. A few more brawlers to 550 and I would have gotten 1500 which could buy a mega box.  
---
If you are keeping your brawlers above 550 this system gives more boxes per season than before.
---
I highly doubt they would team though. Even if they try to its to get an easy kill
---
Obviously not a repost
---
Hopefully ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
What happened ?
---
I didnt do anything it was like that I promise
---
I don't understands Rosa's please explain
---
No it was like that in game I didnt do anything
---
THIS THING IS NOT CRINGE
---
The template is overused
---
Same lol
---
Soo nice *sniff*
---
Nasƒ± buldun la beni
---
It takes me about 4 hours total for one
---
W.O.W.... Awesome.
---
Dude, you made a big mistake. Brawlers won't be able to pass if they go from left.
---
OMG this skin is making my eyes glitter! Perfect!üëå

My favorite brawler is Jessy. #2JQYPGCGQ
---
Well you‚Äôre clearly not patient
---
Thank you so much! &lt;3
---
thanks man you deserve more upvotes and platinum awards !!!
---
I solo these often.  You'll be fine.  The trick is to run right up to him, he swings over you.
---
I get that too, but aside from this one thing, they announce everything days, if not weeks (like the Leon skin) in advance.  I guess I just viewed this as a unique surprise.  Even on CR, they never announce Gold or Gem Rush in advance; you just open up the game and BAM, there it is.
---
Just get a brawler to the next 25 or 30 or whatever rank
---
Idea good Job
---
No I am and now I'm working hard because my leggie luck is around 2000
---
Idea yeah
---
But does that stop me from spending all my gems on skins instead of levels and star powers? Of course not.
---
Idea wonderfull
---
No I am rlly I'm back to the game and I'm starting to work
---
Well I didn‚Äôt said you can‚Äôt
---
Oh ok
---
I've never gotten that close to him.  To clarify, if you stand in his hit-box circle, he basically can't hit you?!?
---
Reply*
---
I think you ought to read his username üòÇ
---
But I-I-I can-can I ha-have a condition
---
I Will try to fix it, there are Still some change that can be maked
---
ok....
---
r/ihadastroke
---
Did Leon skin add to game I can't see it in my shop
---
Looks good but think you coulda done better creatively. He needs a skin other than being a system.
---
I wil buy that skin for gems .
---
*will
---
Am or pm if am I can't watch

It's ok like a 7.5/10
---
I gave this rating because the middle is too much Water so when the zone comes very close the tanks will kill everyone but with all this negativoty a Little positivity doesnt kill
---
Entries are now closed. Will be picking winners later tonight.
---
Maybe you should try digital drawing? Wonder how that will look
---
Is this worth it to do? Do you actually get more tokens overall than without the event doubler or does it come out to the same?

Copied from u/Gedi Kor

I almost never look at trophy amount unless it is exceptionally high. The only thing that matters to me is top 3 brawlers, lvl to trophy ratio, average brawler lvl and which modes he plays. (Im 15,000 player)

Thanks. All im missing is tara, mortis and spike

Can it run tetris?

It gets the effect 2x,its like 20x2x2,super worth a try.
---
Yes that's my next move in the next few months...I'm getting a new desktop computer, and some drawing program... nothing super expensive but good enough to do this kind of art.
---
Good enough to do any kind of custom stuff from scratch.
---
Do you have a drawing program you recommend?
---
mecha bo and mecha crow skins make you win
---
yees

Our giveaway drawing pays no attention to vote karma. You can have -10 or 100 and your chances are the same.

I got 17 in the big box

So basically it spawns a Leon bot that deals 0 damage? Interesting idea

Beautiful as always legendary idea
---
If you have any brawlers over 500, at the end of the season, they reset to set values depending on what that brawler‚Äôs rank is.
---
 For example, if a brawler were at 587 trophies, that‚Äôs rank 21, which means the reset would leave that brawler at 550 trophies. 
---
So, let‚Äôs say you had 4 brawlers at 525 trophies. They would all get reset back to 500, since 550 is the cutoff for rank 21, and 500 is rank 20. You would essentially lose 100 trophies. So, if this is what happened to you, I hope I helped.
---
By the way, the season ended late last night.
---
is it worth it to spend the start points on these?
---
Look at the title
---
Answer i got from Support:
---
Hello, xxx!
---
Thank you for your patience and your report to us! I am xxx and it is nice to meet you! 
---
This has happened to me too, in order to prevent/fix it I swap the wifi/mobile data or close all apps via task manager (if out of session) and restart the app to fix that.
---
Our game team is working feverishly in order to fix this as soon as possible and it will be included in our next update (optional or regular one)! 
---
Thank you again for your report, it is with your feedback and observations that will allow us to keep making this game better for all players!
---
Please keep an eye out on your Appstore/Play store for any future optional updates that will address this.
---
Keep Brawlin' (and being awesome)
---
lol all I said is I won shark Leon, don‚Äôt get mad at me for winning, please.
---
Thanks man this is Nice to hear
---
Really depressing, I've got 100 coins from standard brawl boxes. You can imagine my disappointment waiting two weeks for my star shop mega box to open this üòÖ
---
I need coins, that is the type of box I need in my life
---
Lmaoo I know I thought it would be obvious since is a ghost
---
Why I am in the center
---
which gang should i do next
---
Seems like an extremely good time to buy some token doublers, eh?
---
You legit just stole art
---
I think they are made on Eastern Europe or something. They are small companies printing these out to make a profit, they even have the old Brawl Stars Logo from back in BETA. Cheap knockoffs.
---
Oh, wait- so does it subtract 40 from the token doubler?
---
Or does it still only subtract 20, but give you 40?
---
Didn't enter because I have Leon already, and I wanted people who don't have Leon to have the opportunity to unlock him :)
---
Heh, that‚Äôs pretty rad m8!
---
Brawlstars in general is exteremly f2p, sure you can speed shit up a bit with money but you can also max out without spending a penny.
---
Lol...it's the angle
---
Are you maxed out on brawlers and power points?
---
Apart from the fact 1up comes with a shield...o.p
---
Same. Got 80% more rewards for less work pushing past 18k.
---
Thank you so much...I appreciate your support!
---
YES! That sounds really fun to make! I'm on it!
---
You also just got a cheap skin for free, too
---
Does not work for me at all. Waiting for the update
---
I feel like this is the best way to handle it.
---
Now this is a meme, nice to see someone else with my name is making epic memes
---
He can atak
---
THANKS!
---
Yeah the star power for sure was the cause of the miracle win, never doubted that.  Key is to not rely on it so that it might save you at the end like this.  I was the only one on my team with range, and had 2 teams hitting us from both direction while staying under cover.  
---
On the flip side no matter what I can usually take out the player that killed me when they move in for the tokens.
---
Links for the downloads! Huge thanks to Toad for helping me, as well as crc! Upvote to keep this at the top please!

Have you tried top hat mortis though?
---
But what if that top hat Mortis is disturbing literally everyone and stealing everyone‚Äôs boxes?
---
Congrats!
---
Ok now this is epic
---
If he had to change his name to that and make a club with that name, he probably mainly plays with randoms, and it's quite hard to push in 3v3 modes like that.
---
Can't jump to conclusions yet, it could be he got hacked or maybe his sibling got on his device. Maybe try contacting him to see what happened. And when you said "close friend" is that internet friend or real life friend?
---
Tick is actually the hardest to kill in high tier skillful matchups when he has well-oiled
---
Not Funny, didn‚Äôt laugh

You should retexture golden apple with power cube.It's fking awesome dude and i love your work. Keep going
