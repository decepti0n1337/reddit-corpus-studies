maybe it can be a shadow tara that copies exactly what you do. So your new skin would still be visible.

---
See you in his next review
---
Not really, the way that your phone works with internet is that it runs everything first from video then till play. It builds an oval like shape in which you can move last, as for it is the toughest part to do.
---
Make a 2nd account and do it with Jessie
---
Cries in wasted 1500 star points
---
Cool dude

How come you can use emojis while us cant use emojis without getting downvoted?

Both your ideas would make a fun and balanced star power

Very smooth drawing

A 6000 trophy 8-bit doesn‚Äôt seem realistic

I mean, it looks fancy and all, but I don't think people will like playing on this map

39 gems for Rockabilly Mortis

Bruh its a joke lol

Ya I think so thx but always they are skin offer I got so stressed about buying or not and I think I will save gems to dynamike Christmas

I‚Äôm only missing one and I have .33% legendary drop I have opened around 300+ boxes in total since sandy‚Äôs release and nothing...
---
bad example since Overwatch nerfs the shit out of people just how mortis was decent then they fuck him
---
what do you mean password. if you mean the supercell id code well i tried and it didnt work he could still get on
---
That‚Äôs for British. American says color.
---
Sadly, many redditors are immature. Just try not to let this idiot get to you. r/brawlstars is especially immature from what I‚Äôve collected just because of the mostly-teen playerbase.
---
Lol
---
Spike uwu
---
But why? What do you get out of it?
---
I got spike
---
I don't even have one
---
Oh yeah just like how  the British say school while Americans say gun range.
---
You aren't? The point is to not need quick coins for whatever you need "right now". Upgrading a brawler can always wait. You shouldn't buy a star power if you don't have all brawlers maxed. And if you have all brawlers maxed you should be able to get coins pretty quick from boxes.
---
I find &lt;InsertNameHere&gt;YT to be like 10x worse.
---
Frame 32.

tell that to brocks ability to unload 4500+ damage at close range faster than darryl or mortis...

The tick at the left just looking at them wondering, ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs that guy again?‚Äù

This is kinda useless cuz what happens if you don‚Äôt have Leon?

He means that the people playing 8 bit have at least 6000
---
I got Big Robo boi

Wish i had leon too lol all i need are mortis and the lengerdarys
---
Over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again

i see the mortis gang is as big as ever

That‚Äôs interesting. I wonder if that‚Äôs true.

You are technically correct, the best kind of correct
---
Wait theres a new map
---
Proof you are the real epik?
---
It wouldn't bounce towards other enemies like Jessie's attack. It would bounce like Rico's normal attack.

I don't like it

???

I‚Äôve played with so many people named like ‚ÄúJOSE EL PRO‚Äù and they are all complete and utter bots

I love your creativity
---
is it just me or could brock use a buff?
---
That's why they have discord
---
oh, yeah, ok. mb
---
Thank you gamer!
---
Instead of screenshoting just swipe done through the comments. It will pause the gif for u to see your brawler.
---
I got the birdbrain bo
---
surprisingly but to me playing it vertically isnt actually that bad
---
*Corporate needs you to find the difference between these two pictures*

There was a buff? Thought they never touched it.

What should i say bruh

neat stuff

Whit Barley
---
I asked for the names of the good value offers. 
---
Stop replying. You have nothing to contribute here, so do us both a favour.
---
I got spike but I haven‚Äôt unlocked him yet
---
It's a lot of effort to sit down. Save all shit. Put all shit on time-line.
---
The name doesn't matter just take the one with the biggest value
---
I have an idea for leon:
---
Wanted
---
Candy store theif
---
Or something like that
---
I always use the same 3 brawler in brawl ball... frank darryl and mortis... because I hate brawl ball. but thank you for the suggest!
---
Penny's mortar which i think is the only spawnable with no name. :(
---
Lmao
---
I am also at 13k and am missing all of the legendary brawlers. And have only 3 star powers
---
I got tick's head
---
I got the tic super
---
Perfect now i know that this subreddit likes stealers more than the original creator.
---
Got piper! (meanwhile i was writing this the '' got milk '' sentence got me...)
---
I am gonna downvote you because you asked for upvotes and used depression, like PooPooHead
---
The mods are so fucking stupid 
---
Theres people stealing, reposting , unrelated posting, and spam accounts 
---
I sincerely think the mods here are so stupid
---
Nice.
---
Ye, they are both made by me

lmao

it's as possible as breathing

there is a 10 megabox pack for like 30 dollars

ball sauce

I can sign it.
---
I feel attacked
---
He was better than piper till snappy sniping if they buff him he‚Äôll be more op
---
That sounds like it would make matchmaking much longer and also would slow down the servers in general
---
NO FACTS HERE PLEASE.
---
It literally didn‚Äôt break any rules
---
lol tara jr.
---
I got Bull XD
---
Yeah pretty much. Good luck though.
---
This meme is made by a kid that's for sure they will do it eventually for everyone
---
Damege per second is 666. Cool
---
He can block people from getting close to you and my Jessie was already rank 20
---
+the joystick when is lag it will register later the walking or shoting 
---
As the glitch theres no lag and it sticks to walking forward or doesn t want to walk which doesn t register later
---
In not sure if it is or not, but it does display now that when u get all brawler or a rarity ur luck for other rarities increase
---
Y
---
I have an Idea
---
I got Crow!! O wait, i have Crow üò∞
---
he is OP in a hand of a skilled player can wipe out an entire team
---
Press yes
---
true, i hope i can at least get sandy soon...
---
Yeah its cuz you have to almost use ur turret aggressively, I don't think you should, juts use it to zone, but it's hard to make work, not very strong even at 500
---
What if the power up lands closer to the box instead of replacing it? That way you don't delete the animation
---
annoy people by constantly shooting XD
---
I haven't got one for over one and a half month.
---
What is she doing in there?
---
Relatable. Parents are divorced, im at 14-15k with only sandy and leon missing. Take a guess.

I have shelly

As an Italian GX (insert name here) is 100x worse

Now that made me smile ^-^
---
Shelly is what I got, AS√å ME GUSTA
---
I thought it was all fine and wholesome until i scrolled down.
---
*Jessie was like a mother to me...*
---
Gone. vanished into thin air
---
Well,for Darryl you would have a Pirate Voice with Accent and memoring phrases along with some original ones and a robotic effect,due to the fact Darryl is a Captain
---
As for leon,it would be some cool teenager's voice but a bit creepy due to the fact he is an assasin
---
I really hope Leon doesn't get Tara's voice and Darryl gets Tick's lmfao
---
u/uwutranslator
---
At least you have ONE legendary here I'm sitting with 0 legendaries at 14k!
---
I have like 10 brawlers sitting on max P.P (don't have enough gold to upgrade), this game is becoming grindy now..
---
I‚Äôm at 18k trophies and I need coins to upgrade like 24 brawlers, like its so stupid what are they thinking 14 coins out of a box? You know how long that takes for me to upgrade a brawler? Months
---
Shelly :,)
---
Hi! May I know where u got the Brawl Halloween poster from? I would like to take part in it
---
Jayyysus!!!!
---
Well, hope life serves us well from now on. Thanks for the answer kind sir.
---
That sounds really cool
---
Yeah
---
This is so cool
---
The post to the left. I think that‚Äôs it
---
No no and no and your name has that teaming tag in it which is why i hope you will never get a legendary
---
Any new unpaid way to get gold is giving out gold. Right now there's a limit to the rate of tokens you can get without paying.
---
If there were more missions that gave gold, gold would become less scarce and people would buy power points and upgrade faster.
---
The whole idea of power points is just a way to get people to spend real money. Otherwise all it does is undermine competitive play. They have to balance the rate of progression. Too slow and people will leave. Too fast and nobody will pay.
---
I made a new account about a month ago and am really feeling the limitations of my power 6 brawlers. However, the alternatives are less desirable for me.
---
I got the mouse bot
---
But you forgot....but you didn't do....but what about... 
---
I think you missed....
---
Did you do....
---
What if....
---
Maybe ...
---
Nope! He got them all! 
---
XD
---
That's what I'm wondering
---
Oof
---
Its from gedi-kor post
---
What about the PowerPoints
---
Almost immediately!!
---
Power 1 rank 23 crow. Amateur
---
Noce
---
Spike
---
Omg this is SO HILARIOUS XDDDDDDD
---
Congrats bro!!
---
Im also at 10k, got crow back in 1500üò±
---
I mean a lock function where people won't accidentally open boxes while trying to save them
---
Bruh that sucks !
---
Lol he puts those in all the time
---
I got boss robot
---
I wonder what is your feeling if Supercell puts all the face you draw in each brawler icon just for your account only üòÇüòÇ
---
u/lesbianboy
---
Or... 1 ticket...
---
Nice skills! Although it will be safer to play mortis on maps with more walls
---
Free mega box that has a 100% chance to give me a character?
---
thanks :)
---
More better
---
I got Penny's turret (what?)
---
Not really i think you shld save for other brawlers
---
Gene's pat on the back is waaay to different here. Of course why would you use his game-changing super to just heal a teammate. It's like wasting a great opportunity to grab an enemy. 
---
In the other hand, Pam's super was made to heal so teammates will most likely to stay on the area if not too long, but still they were to go back just to heal. I do understand that you would not want to sacrfice Pam's super just to heal 2 ticks of the healing it could give. But in other modes just like robo rumble, gemgrab etc, it would be useful because staying alive is the key and staying in the healing station can help you stay alive. And also, im saying that we could buff it by 100 or 200 for it to offer greater amount of healing
---
No. And also if I had to, I would choose darryl.
---
Thanks bro :)
---
Child you shouldn‚Äôt be drawing in class
---
Or...Bot 2/Leon
---
Nice vid! Editing needs a bit of work, but overall, pretty sweet!
---
Wow Mortis at 890 trophiesüòÇ
---
AT least he does not have 10 gems
---
r/shittybrawlstars
---
Bro it's just a song man,
---
That‚Äôs literally 4089 different combinations. I don‚Äôt think it can fit in one post, and who would put in the effort to do it?
---
Please no
---
Ur stupid leon moves faster only ehen his super is active but colt runs faster. And bull has shield when his health drops below 40 % and bibi has shield only when her home run is illy charged. Idiot. Analphabet
---
Its a glitch where you pick a star power then turn off your wifi then pick the brawler you want to use that star power with and play with it
---
Why?
---
Like A Month Late
---
Doing God‚Äôs work my friend
---
u/spicychickencrow
---
i dont see colt as much as I see piper, leon. Takedown is teamer heaven
---
Lol nice. Also, welcome to the sub üòÅ
---
No offense, but it seems like you're just begging for upvotes by guilting everyone that sees this post. Stealing is bad but the fact that you are complaining about 200 up votes instead of 300 seems kinda scummy.
---
Supercell didn‚Äôt give sandy on my birthday üò™
---
Pretty good after buffed. Now it can tank 3500Hp. Hide behind it after your ult for non-penetrating enemies. It can be suicide against Penny tho.
---
*is that a Jojo reference?*
---
Best skin ever
---
I know i just didnt see this on this subreddit
---
the guy commented right on top of you lmao
---
When you're supposed to be the medic in your team but you just really wanna go fish for kills.
---
It was literally everywhere,how can you not see it
---
lmao l just laughed so hard
---
I dont know 
---
I am sorry
---
How the fuck
---
Though I resent teaming, a part of me dies when a friendly brawler dies. So if I see someone spinning I just leave and fight someone else.
---
Were you even active when it was everywhere?
---
This is fantastic o_o
---
Because MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA
---
No not memorable at all, and neither is this conversation with you as of now. At first you came off as someone with a brain, now you have just proved otherwise. 
---
Well thanks for the click bait. Have a great Monday!
---
Yeah... I was
---
Tickets is actually the best deal for gem on the shop.... token doublers being the second best

Penny's cannon lol

8-Bit‚Äôs Star Power should be nerfed yet again-still too strong

Please feel better. No hard feelings buddy.

I don‚Äôt see the problem here.

Oh my gosh tick head

Auto did not, i tried to throw the running path ran constantly.

Something like a steam controller might work. With the trackpad instead of a stick. I don't know if it would really be better than just using touch controls though.

The "battle pass thing" is called a trophy road.It just shows what rewards you get the more trophies you earn.As for the season,it only affects you if your brawlers have 550 or more trophies and corresponding to your trophies you will get certain amounts of star points

I played many times Poco in bossfight an won

Yeah they seem to be terrible at the game every time lol
---
Oh, gotcha. So my progress will stay after the season ends?
---
everyone talks about this but forgets about rosas attack and super description
---
There are different categories of brawlers.
---
Trophy Road
---
Rare
---
Super Rare
---
Mythical
---
Legendary
---
Basically anything you don't see under trophy Road can only be obtained from boxes
---
You forgotting about fact, that in Clash Royale legendaries are not so valuable, as in Brawl Stars
---
Getting an item box in Mario Kart be like
---
Yup you don't get affected by seasons until you have brawlers with 550 trophies or more
---
Cool. Thanks!
---
Ah yes yet another reason to hang myself
---
damn forgive me lord
---
*Jojo's Bizarre Adventure - Awaken (Pillar Men Theme) starts playing*
---
Okay, but a golden chest or a big box has a tiny chance of giving you a legendary
---
I'd hope so... your star power was 13 vs a 1 and a 0.
---
What the fuck? Leon is not the worst. He is op in solo gamemodes
---
HOLY SH**
---
why do you think, strangers on the internet would give a fuck if you bought a big box or not. downvoted

I dndn't expect that... Nice artwork btw

U were just lucky to hit the enemies, the extra range didnt help.

Dyna can be used in brawl ball as long as the person who uses it isnt noob. Only noobs will think dyna cant be used in ball.

Oh...

I'm at 10.7k and don't consider it endgame, I don't even have all the brawlers, like 4-5 upgraded to level 9-10. Endgame would be when you'd have just some star powers to get and miss only 1 brawler. Trophy road has barely any relevance here.

I dont but i always get bullied by crows bc if his poison. Just stay in range poke and bam enemies are dead. Charge your super and you have an escape plus a dodge AND a damage abilty. When i get close to crow with leon they kill me if they have their super no matter what.

Well you are just bad then. Crow is only annoying in solo. And his is meant to be used for killing off targets or escaping. I have both Crow and Leon. Crow is harder.
---
üò¢üò¢üò¢üò≠ I love Leon but I got crow
---
I do understand that but imo the system should add up the trophies of every brawler in a team and make them play against a team with a similar amount
---
Do you like Minecraft?

*depression face*

Well i push leon in solo and you cant do anything against crow.

Yes people keeps bring piper for brawl ball

Its the most satisfying thing
---
That's cool. I wonder if you could use the spring while you had the ball. That would make for some really interesting maps.
---
then 8 power cubes bibi comes an pushes her
---
It's ok to not know what life leech is..
---
Ignore him.
---
Life leech was basically an add-on to solo showdown like meteor or healing mushroom.
---
It was there before Brawl Stars reached Global. So nobody can blame you because I guess you started playing after global. 
---
Anyways what life leech does is if any two brawlers in solo showdown come close to eachother they would start to lose health per second. It was made to discourage teaming.
---
Get rid of all of them.
---
Thanks :3
---
JUst one job man.

It's a mod of brawl stars, the One Who posted literally posted a screenshot of a community map from it

a better version of chavern churn?love that map with rico

That‚Äôs probably what caused the issue, like I said outdated.
---
Edit: meant to respond to your reply to my comment.
---
Stay on the boss bot from start to finish, dodge every1 you can, that usually fixes most problems, although there‚Äôs the occasional rng with spawns but that‚Äôs why you try to dodge everybody and keep good spacing to stay alive as long as you can to prevent ‚Äòopposite side of the map‚Äô spawns. I find if I keep that up even with maintaining only 0/1/2 power boxes the entire match I always get top 5, top 3 even. Just some advice for whoever struggles with takedown
---
Well, you can't predict the future if your next team wins or not, but hey I will agree with ya, .. I just recongize you are aginst your own team, rip you.
---
Fine... I‚Äôll do it myself

no buy doublers and tickets for starpower

Takedown is probably the best solo gamemode and my personal favorite. I don't know what you're talking about.

Can't buy the star power if you don't have that brawler; aside from the fact the the brawler has to be level 9 to even get a star power.

X¬≤+69X¬≤=0;

---
x=‚àö70

x=8.36

So thanks to the "69" in the nickname, the nickname became better and it got a 8.4/10 rating

But if there wasnt 69 in here then:
---
X¬≤+X¬≤=0
---
2x¬≤=0

x¬≤=2

x=‚àö2

x=1.41

1.4/10  Pretty shitty rating isnt it? Conclusion, always add 69 in your nickname cuz it is the best number in the universe

This is similar to a recent vod of a Penny Turret shooting something off screen (and off the battlefield). Weird.

I agree but people think this is eaiser than pushing with shelly or bull in showdown, so I rather see this then in showdown.  Just my opinion doe.

Yea i know i also sometimes refer to him as her even my entire band calls him her. Normally there stands "fighter" like on all other fighter brawlers, but in german it's "k√§mpfer", just on sandy stands "k√§mpferin" (the female form of fighter in german)
---
Anyway, when you upgraded all brawlers to power 9, you can savely start saving up for star powers in the shop (well you can't use your money for anything else, so it's the only option). Since you have everyone on power 9, the star powers should come, you can't get anything else from boxes, except coins and the bonuses (gems/tickets) and with enough coins you can buy star powers you really want. 
---
So it will go like this: you play some games and open the boxes you got, repeat and at some point you'll get a randome star power, then later you'll have enough coins to buy one, you wait till a good one comes up in the shop and buy it, and so on, in this time you can always try out your new star powers and have more fun than normally, so you will still have much fun in the time you get maxed

How can you be that much of a dumbass? Your cropping is horribly shitty.
---
The first SP is surprisingly good
---
It‚Äôs a PvEvP game mode where killing other players nets you almost nothing once you account for time used to kill said players. In any game where you can freely choose to kill or not to kill another player, and it has little to no effect on your chance of winning, killing is considered toxic. 
---
I typically play in the 600 - 800 range, I understand that it is a strategy that is used and I can see that the people who use it usually don‚Äôt win. It‚Äôs not a viable way to play. If there was a live leaderboard then you could strategically select who to kill to maximize your chance of catching up or keeping the lead. But at the moment it typically doesn‚Äôt work that way, you only end up losing and ruining the fun of other people‚Äôs games.

Idk maybe try it?

(Sad) teaming in showdown (happy) teaming in takedown.
---
Yeah if you want to do it go in a freindly game
---
Well, something else which is fun is: you play crow in duo showdown and always try to hunt the enemies down you see, like there's a shelly, you hit her with your max range, but she can't hit you, if she comes after you, you can just run away, cause you're faster and if she runs away, you can follow her and always poison her, it takes more time, but at some point she'll die, then go for the next enemy, it's pretty fun, well for you it will be fun, but for the enmies, not so much
