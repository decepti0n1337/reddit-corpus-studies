Doc, Im countin on ya!
---
I love my ball!
---
Too bad, chucklenuts.
---
Amazing? Portrait mode is dogshit. And you can barely see anything
---
yeah this should be her star power
---
as of you know, spot lights dont reveal you in bushes literally in every other stealth games
---
I agree 100%, passion for a game's flaws and possible fixes are a wonderful thing. But I usually just see sheer anger and whining. It's just annoying to me having to know that I share a game with lil bitches I guess :)
---
i don't see the problem with that tho
---
aaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhgggghhh.
---
Not neccesarily.
---
A stick is more laudable than a cow.
---
I've seen no Pam lewds.  Probably because of her protective thickness.
---
There are for sure things Supercell can do better, I'm with ya there. But this sub acts like we're all paying customers getting raped in front of our grandmother or something.
---
Lol, now that I see it, they actually do look alike!
---
Pam's and colt's star powers are one of the best in the game. Especially in ticketed events. You can use pam on robo rumble for that consistent healing and you can use colt to run around in boss fight. Shelly's star power is the only thing that makes her super useful because without it it only dose 500 damage or something. Maybe a little more the closer you get. That slow can give your team the opportunity for a crucial pick like letting your gene pull the pam with 10 gems or slowing the piper so your piper can get that pick. 
---
Primo's star power is useless don't get it
---
Advertising dude? Must be new to reddit.
---
how about reporting you for spamming?
---
cuz i did.
---
As if it had any skill to begin with. All the bibi's on SD is completely normal because she was literally just released so whenever we get a new brawler you'll see them on SD
---
Yeah just you
---
Backstab lul
---
Thank you!
---
It's the other parts that's meant to be funny
---
El Primo is here
---
Beautiful reminds me of the old days of elixir and chips
---
Hell no.
---
Lol
---
Better rephrase that, because they are not updating. They are talking about the update, and they have been for almost two years.
---
That was my next idea.
---
yeah. Better be good lol.
---
FBI is here to raid the FBI which is raiding the Redditor
---
Shelly needs a SPAS-12 skin ("french resistance"?) or a SAIGA skin (cutthroat comrade)
---
Yea typo
---
Thx to for your reply mr.ponko
---
:(
---
Yeah, my vid is more of a tips video though, you know, more for beginners. But i get your point
---
so torches work on everything, even colt? i mean if u shoot 1 bullet will it light the whole chain? and for shield how about when ur shield has max health it just leaves it there
---
Such a good bargain, imagine what you can buy with that 1 gem you save
---
Pam and colt star power are nowhere close to that good. Colt is a C or B tier and pam is a D, she would be an F if robo rumble didn‚Äôt exist, as thats the only place its ever useful. Shelly‚Äôs is only good if you need to run but wasting your super to do it isnt real smart in most cases.

What Rosa should have sounded like:Your a thorn in my side.

Stay juicy, stay fine, and spin on teamers.
---
I wish I have Gene
---
It‚Äôs not my fault the make bad decisions
---
It‚Äôs just that he‚Äôs gotten like 4 needs now and he‚Äôs clearly not as strong as February Leon
---
Lol true
---
The Brawl Stars community doesn‚Äôt understand that the dev team is SMALL, and unlike the Clash Royale team, listens to the community as much as possible, sure they won‚Äôt implement the skins the subreddit likes, but they try their hardest and work day and night for a update that you people complain about.
---
Bibi is perfectly fine and I‚Äôll like to see how she affects this Meta
---
Weak maps? What weak maps? Some showdown maps may be easier to win in then others but you have to learn which brawlers are best and go with what you have
---
As it was already stated here before, multiple skins for a Brawler is easier to make then other‚Äôs, a Piper skin might be very hard to make comparing it to a Barley, or Shelly skin
---
There is no reason to complain, they try their best...
---
This is the quality content this sub needs. +1 for comic sans.
---
This does introduce a new style of maps and concepts within a brawler, but yeah it isn't the biggest. This just introduced some new styling and brawler mechanics.
---
I know this is about the boxes, but I‚Äôm too jealous at the fact that you got Leon in the +3000 trophy range...
---
Exposed
---
Right over here
---
I also unlocked gene with same thought
---
My friend got her first box FIRST!
---
Or something called saving up boxes. 
---
I had over 300 boxes saved and I maxed bibi out in 30 mins. ‚úåÔ∏è
---
What are you at
---
They holding my man leon back, he got nerfed like 5 times in a row, no skins no voice, like damn give my man something.
---
Big Hero 6 is Marvel property.
---
Yuhhh
---
The best two games to exist
---
Looks kinda similar to the one fan art where she‚Äôs holding a machete, but it looks great nonetheless üëå
---
probably because it's tied to her attack sound effect
---
Supercell is my name, Brawl Stars is my game!
---
You came into the wrong house, fool! (Ik it ain‚Äôt Big Smoke, but still...)

They must really suck if you still won
---
mortis is a finisher, hes supposed to kill anyone who is at low health during the round (talking in 3v3 terms) and he also has the most mobility in the game
---
Thanks dude
---
No one cares

Which one. Lol

Super cool concept! 10/10
---
Gene üòÇ
---
Yeah, I agree. As a Darryl, a good Mortis player is a nightmare...
---
LETS ROCK!!!
---
hell nah, of someone disconnects, its mostly because they were kicked due to the connection being bad, and this is mostly an error that comes from the servers and not you own internet, so a bigger trophy loss would be just am asshole move for those who have these problems
---
Oh thank god.
---
congrats
---
I started to use that icon as soon as I hit 10,000 and now I feel like changing it because I don‚Äôt want to support this
---
Dank.
---
is that detectable even? pretty sure that whenever you get a single battle ban it just detects the activity, so its either due to bad connection OR idling
---
You see the Piper's butt? That's creepy. xD
---
God that super button effect is annoying
---
Golden week

exactly i agree with polish thats all they need, the both of them
---
The world is blind

I can‚Äôt guarantee that, I‚Äôll try(less often 1 or 2 times a day at most) or maybe I‚Äôll forgot one day.

I mainly use her hit back to my advantage by hugging the boundary. So I can hit enemies into gas.

But Rolling charging brawler gettibg stunned over water was fixed about last or two updates ago.....

u can get dyna from boxes back then

Completely agree

Nice concept! And colouring! Always appreciate traditional art
---
Honestly nobody cares
---
I‚Äôm impressed tbh
---
Yeah I know, but still it is difficult to predict the movements of brawlers and move accordingly within seconds. 
---
Do you even have Leon. I feel Like if you did you‚Äôd know the answer to these extremely easy questions.
---
ABSDHAHBSHAHSAFHADHFADHHUAHUAUAHA

Excatly

Think is most close range is tanks except mortis I think they should increase his attack range but he dashes the same distance so he dashes then swinsgs the shovel forward pretty much
---
nobody plays siege except top player 10000+ and we now know that .02% of all active players

Let's be real, no one would join that 3rd player.

Community not being noticed, wtf? U guys all asked for a crow buff, rosa and Leon nerfs and that‚Äôs what they gave u, this sub is now full of whiny 9 year olds making tons of shit posts on the same memes and complaining about every fricken update. This sub is starting to turn into one like fortnite‚Äôs just a bunch of ungrateful kids wanting free stuff.
---
Has this ever happened to you? You bought a house and it was not disclosed to you it had a termite infestation? In the walls and in the mouldings? So you have to take it upon yourself to call your own termite extermination company? But when the guys show up they immediately ask if they can use your bathroom? Then for over two hours they take turns going in and out of there taking huge mud pies and overflushing? Then they go in there together, and you hear a bunch of scrounging around, then you hear a bunch of yelling, and one of them is standing in the bathroom doorway shouting at you that his friend's foot is stuck in the toilet? And he says "Help him! You gotta help him!" And when you go in there to help him he just pulls it out of there easily and laughs cause his foot wasn't stuck? It wasn't stuck at all, he was just faking it? And then they get really serious and go "It's Turbo Time!" And they both start running around the house as fast as they can and jumping over the couches, but when you try to jump in they yell at you and they say "You're not part of the Turbo Team! Don't run! You don't run with us, we're the ones who run! Until you're part of this Turbo Team, walk slowly!"
---
So you go lay down and be by yourself and read your art books, but then the next day you went into the bathroom and it looked like the hole in your toilet had shrunked? You said "How could that be? There's no way they could have shrunk the toilet!" But then you saw in the trash a receipt from Home Depot for a toilet the exact same size as yours but with a¬†joke hole that's just for farts! They replaced your toilet with a fart toilet? And now you can't go to the bathroom in your house cause your toilet can't suck them down and you feel suck to your stomach?!
---
Has that ever happened to you?!
---
Oh btw nice post.
---
What game modes did you push her in? And what is her role?

No offense but r/noonecares

---
This update was a new brawler, repackaged maps, a few skins, and a rosa nerf...
---
Pretty underwhelming. My expectations are pretty low now with updates. So many good ideas from the community and we just get more of the same... (hey different colors at least) lol
---
hows about we nerf that range of rosa
---
Cuz capitalism
---
It's the way crow's super works. By autoaiming his super. He lands at the location where the closest enemy was at when you first tap the super button. The daggers dont start right in the middle of crow. And thus. When you land directly in an enemy, none of the daggers will hit an enemy. All brawlers have the same hurtbox. So if they stand still while crow uses his super, they wont get hurt. This does not apply to the boss robot, the vault and IKE, and large brawlers, where their hurtboxes are larger and can get hit by the daggers. I hope this clears up some confusion as to why none of crow's daggers when he lands hit an enemy
---
Penistone

U have small penis enlargement
---
I strongly am agents brawl stars having a battle pass... this would make the game like fortnite... brawl stars need something unique and more original
---
THIS POST X10000!!!
---
There is such little incentive to grind trophies. I mean, I wish they at least added some cosmetic skins to unlock or cosmetic titles/profile pics we can use... they could be a lot more creative than just 300coins...
---
I think a cool one on death would be "three strikes... I'm out"
---
Imagine playing with a team of Piper, El Primo and Crow
---
I already knew why. Just thought it was interesting and probably not intended.
---
why does everyone want tara to have a voice

SUUUPER Laggy. good though. if its too laggy, use  [https://pixelcrux.com/Brawl\_Stars/Map\_Designer/App](https://pixelcrux.com/Brawl_Stars/Map_Designer/App)

I just got Bibi, and guess what? My rates didn't decrease. Both times I've gotten Mythics however, my rates dropped.

Its so weird... Bibi had done her swing BEFORE Gene super, but it didnt affect him
---
Boss Fight Rosa pls

---
for the voice thing I think they should have released a voice for a brawler that's been in the game for a while, instead of giving a voice for each new brawler immediately, I mean, if u can afford to hire a voice actor, Hire one for a brawler that we have been begging to get a voice, I'd personally love a Darryl voice, or tara (except i have no idea how her voice would be like), hell, even Leon or spike, if we wanted a Rosa voice we would have asked for one
---
There's a record that's 17sec but that's still impressive

I think this update was/is very over hyped. They added a new Brawler and some new maps, but come on, no story mode of any kind? I wasn't a fan of this update, although I really like playing brawl stars.
---
On the contrary.
---
P2p players should have the coins to avoid that.

Hey that‚Äôs me

I got Bibi, my rates didn't drop. They did when I got Tara and Mortis though.
---
"Oh no, everyone will care about what I ranked"

Being able to end a heist game in 10s, that's game breaking, all the robot rumble exploits, that's game breaking

In the end...BiBi is still edgy

Good luck to you, may the randoms be great.

I think she needs some kind of buff or remove the delay before hits..

See kids think that this update is useless but they hard work into this
---
Yeah I appreciate the update too tbh
---
Yeah but crow has a movement speed advantage.  Spike doesn't.  She has huge damage POTENTIAL.  She doesn't do huge damn consistently.  To be able to get that huge damage usually means your too close to the enemy brawler.  I'm not op but I have all the brawlers.  Spike definitely needs a buff and it should be a health buff.  Usually brawlers that low in hp have a big movement advantage either base speed or star power.  Spike doesn't have any of that.  She has a trap which is ok, but to utilize her star power requires her going into her own trap, which isn't really wise when she has such little base health.   Her trap can't out heal incoming damage so it doesn't allow her to be aggressive.  This means you'd have to use your super in a non combat situation to heal which is useless since you'd just heal anyway.  Plus if you are just tagging enemies with the spikes then it's going take a lot of shots to build that kind useless star power.
---
Please tell me how it is broken?
---
Then you play mortis on the wrong maps. Play him on stormy plains, Skull creek and Rockwall Brawl. Low health brawlers are there in shwodown, after having had a fight with another brawler. They usually have low health and you can finish them off. Idk how you can't find them.
---
Or you're just bad at mortis in general. You're probably the type of person who plays mortis as a gem carrier
---
Yeah maybe but if the box is too easy to get, Brawl Stars won't implement it
---
Please ask me first if you want to copy my works..üòî Although you've done it wellüòä
---
i've been looking at the message for 5 hours now and I still don't know where the error is
---
The good old days
---
And supercell add only 3 balance changes...
---
This only makes her balanced
---
Agree I dun thk they hv to add new brawlers instead they shd add more quality and end game content . There‚Äôs no motivation for players over 11k to push
---
It is easier to do skins for Brock than Tara. And they look good too, so I don't see any problem other than Brock having too many skins. Besides they need to remodel Tara first, so that's why until then she has no skins
---
But you're basically describing what you are doing to push to 12k
---
I mean its been done for his main attack you literally just copied mortis or bibi's attack and his super is basically described as a colt super when you land all your shots
---
Star player on the losing team?
---
This has been happening to me as well. I don't know what is causing but they should defintiely look into it, it's very aggravating losing a fight because of it.
---
Yep. Actually inspired by Boom Beach
---
not me
---
Probably is a siege expert with alot of time for himself
---
Yeah, you're probably right.
---
I know right i was so fed up at seeing the same posts about the same thing
---
Buff mortis supercell he really need a buff
---
That's not a valid argument
---
True but i didn‚Äôt buy her
---
perhaps
---
2000 coins wait its 2 coins lol jk
---
"By community" Im gotta stop you right there.
---
So why do good girls fall in love with me?
---
Understandable Chief
---
Wait so he got the brawler from a brawl box and there was no reason to waste 10$ on gems to buy here?
---
Says the one with Jessie's flair
---
Lol yes it is. You‚Äôre calling like an 8 year old sexy, that‚Äôs absolutely disgusting. Don‚Äôt be a pedophile
---
Yeah... that'll be nerfed. üò•
---
lol. My first post that actually went well.
---
I agree! Darryl really needs a massive health buff for a tank and he might need to nerf his star power as its becomes too reliant. Many you could also give him more dmg at far range
---
Pam is my name thickness is my game
---
ShE GoNnA UsE It As A Di**Do
---
‚ÄúMakes the game a little more fair for them‚Äù what does that even mean
---
Right. I'm saying itll probably get buffed. And in comparison colt's sucks. And leon. Super duration is what 6 seconds now? Like you cant even get away from rosa or primo. I mean. It was kind of stupid broke in heist but... damn.
---
There isnt much content from the update so they spread them out through the month so its *like* were getting something new but its just so we dont get bored the first week and stop playing till next month
---
Do you know the release day
---
2k coins like every other star power
---
Kk thanks
---
Landscape update brought, new UI, crows voice, Saphire Plains gem grab map (gone), landscape ofc, 
---
Ahh Landscape hater is here smh
---
What? Thats like saying yiu are automatically a furry for having crow as a flair, or you are a fat person for rico.
---
The other team had 400 trophies.
---
That's how you can view it.
---
I literally opened 5 boxes and got her lmao
---
I don't understand why crow's jacket has a cat.
---
Atleast we can hope next update gonna be big because its summer next month but we can only hope.
---
Honestly i wouldnt be mad if they delayed next month's update to july so they have more timr to make content

Did u mean di*do?

But then without their super Primo and Bull and all the short rangers would be useless

This would be too good to be real

Ahhhh now I get it. Well, I see what you mean, but let them get in trouble for their ‚Äúsins‚Äù, it‚Äôs very hard for people to change other people. We may be able to give them ideas and reasons for the ideas, but they must be the ones to decide to follow/listen to those ideas. Also, just because someone says something on the internet does not mean that‚Äôs how they act in the real world (it‚Äôs the sad truth, but it‚Äôs how the world is now. MOST people are not just completely honest with themselves)

Try mega knight primo

His super can jump like the one in clash royale
---
NO MUST MEME

Dude, calm down. I don't mean literally breaking the game. I just mean that it completely distorts the game and ruins the meta.

Which tier is highest?

But get Leon on the first box?

Do I make sense? Also I was correcting someone‚Äôs incorrect information. Even if the informed is kinda‚Äùsinful‚Äù, teaching them what‚Äôs really right (factual or morally) is the best thing someone can do in my opinion

That's on you. I personally have been playing since three months before global, and I still play daily. There are over 500k people who still play, meaning the dev team must be doing something right. It's not their fault if your someone who gets bored of games easily.
---
dude this trick is known since the pads got added to the game
---
Stunning as always
---
This is basically mortis super now
---
Thats the fair downside. You would need to keep it in check. Bibis knockback is also not always good, you create a distance that can be your demise.

You would have to keep your passive out of funktion if you see that you won‚Äôt need it in the next time

This might be old, but he's absolutely shit. All my brawlers are above 400 but Darryl is stuck in the 250s. He's only good at surprise attacks on a weak crow or piper(without their supers). He can't take on short range brawlers nor his his ult useful against long range brawlers. Forget mortis Darryl needs a huge buff
---
Supercell did send these cryptic messages about the new update to these Brazilian youtubers and got everyone talking about it. They wanted the hype.

Shelly:WhY yOu BuLlY mE

Piper:Because,I can,Sweatie

Is it a coincidence that I got gene when this came out
---
If ur really high skill in mortis , you wont just cleaning up after ur teaming u need to add pressure and constantly keep harrasing them, this is only in gem grab tho in the other mods i can agree he is bad

It's not because the post is outdated that you must steal it

Fixed matchmaking? Lol. Nah son. Barley and Brock needed more skins. There was no time to make matchmaking decent.

You make that? I love it but hate it cause now I want nibble tea.

Love the concept. Glad people take part in our community to procreate stuff that supercell would never think of. Sad that this won't be added. Supercell please change.

Same happened to me, when I was no powercube Shelly and I just made Superstack on El Primo with 17 powercubes

Why isn't his ultimate a black billiards ball though? I think that would fit her so well

He's not, I understood what he said. I tried hard this game when I started to play, I wanted to be maxed out very quickly. But after a few months, I stared to get tired, but always wanted to grind as much as I can. When I forgot to do my keys, I became uncomfortable as he said, as if I had to play to not wasting time. Because of that, I got tired of the game, because that desire to be "constant" ruined my gaming pleasure.
---
Now I play only to unlock the big keys, but when I have a few little keys left, it's always a strange and bad feeling to quit the game and loose them. However this "game system" could have made me feel that same sensation, but it would not bother me anymore bc I (almost) maxed out my account.

More range, more damage, faster recharging all this he needs

Siege is by far my favorite game mode.  Fight me.

Also fuck Carl (the Reason why i'm Not saying f ck Rosa is because she is hot)
---
overused topic but i find it funny because of the gif

Rosa is fine now in my opinion. She is still strong but it's not a save lost when you face her

Sure, but could you please leave the link of your channel?

Yes

Hey,
---
Just wanna say I really love side story. Thanks for such a great, not completely luck-based map!
---
Removing post because supercell took care of it
---
What about primo + rosa = shelly
---
+ good randoms
---
And added 5 skins
---
just quality
---
reminds me of giratina
---
I take it you like auto-aim...
---
That is fing adorable.
---
If the Mona Lisa and Sistine chapel had a baby, this would be it. Just gorgeous.
---
I still doubt Colt would be related to Bull or Pam, because in the trailer No Time To Explain, Bull was Wanted and Colt's a sheriff! Pam is a Junker and made her own weapons while Colt has probably custom-made revolvers. ¬∞~¬∞
---
And if you do get close....you knock them back further away.  Her passive gets in the way quite a bit.  You can't really hide with her cause when you surprise some.... You knock them away.
---
Thought colt was pams brother or something
---
I really love Canadian barley

Token doubler is like a megabox but 30 gems cheaper without discount

I got gene today too

Mine ia 0.0960 i dont even have any legy or maythic brawlers and i dont have piper and bibi
---
She is still good.
---
Geez how many brawlers u have?
---
Thanks :)
---
Where will the screws appear?
---
This is one of the best showdown maps that i seen ( i mean created by someone)
---
I'd like to See it in a game
---
Imagine asking for bibi when u hot spike
---
What if there were two mini IKE turrets on the sides that had less range, damage, and health. That you had to get through before you fight the main IKE. But with the addition of mini turrets, you would have to increase the battlefield size a bit, maybe put some extra time on the clock, and decrease the health of the main IKE a bit.
---
*auto-aim carl‚Äôs super*
---
Wait you are serious. You really gave me silver award. Thank you sooooooo muchh!!
---
Looks like clash royale with extra steps.
---
Amazing.

Darryl is my name, barreling is my game!

Best one yet

Sei Italiano?

# lol it actually is
---
Posts like these scare me.
---
Only one mythic, two epics, and no legendaries.
---
Bro I have no idea, I was just making the map as a reference.
---
Yes but i said when the sale ends but the token doublers are in the shop
---
This will actually beneficial for teamers.Cuz spin and damage the target and pass the life draining to victim .What could be worse than people teaming against u and u are lossing 100 hp constant with no healing.
---
Yum
---
Every time i see gedi-kor is simply amazing design! Gg

PaDdLeS tO tHe mEtAlS

also adding the teaser on tik tok, making an animation and adding spike sock later to it. thats the overhyping
---
haha, youre welcome‚òùÔ∏è
---
Haha, not bad. I feel like Carl and Rosa also made good use of this version
---
they make the matchmaking harder for teams in one of the last updates
---
Any super rares?
---
lol
---
Bc i got all of them
---
The ones in the game are also created by people like us you know? Brawl Stars said so in the brawl talk. They said that the current maps were community created and that it's no exception that this update will include new ones by the people. I'm hoping it does get added despite the needed balancing, I'm still a beginner. Thanks for the review.
---
And i got frank and carl in like 15 minutes
---
Wtf happens to Nita?
---
True
---
good idea but honestly I think you‚Äôre upset that you lost 100 trophies in the past 15 minutes
---
üëç

Colt should also call for his mother, as it's one of his voice lines.
---
where did u find that
---
It is russian blyat word, but with minor changes (swear word). I'm Belorussian, I hate them.

I am from Russia –ë–õ–≠–¢ is tag of very famous YouTube Icearrow –ë–ª—ç—Ç people team a ND don't kill his temate –ë–ª—ç—Ç is the best tag))))))))

Its useful to climb doe

Does anyone know what the thing next to the handle is for? I don't even know what it's called.

I think its a dead leon hoodie

It looks like it

I actually ment putting bushes here (see photo). I was in a hurry and couldn't explain it very well, my bad ;).

Well, it‚Äôs lewd
---
It's so fucking high :D.
---
It‚Äôs extremely useful in brawl ball.
---
yes agreed. Im still recovering from Leons release haha 549 gems and that was the "discount price" and thats like $40. Also it turns out bibi with star power is insane.. looks like i was wrong about her being suprisingly weak.
---
_Wow_
---
Any tier list includes ricochet i like it
---
Um
---
No Leon
---
Solo rewards skill and strategy? Wtf are you smoking? You can literally bush camp your way to rank 15 and then team your way to rank 20. It‚Äôs the lowest skill, lowest strategy mode in the game. By far.

Lord forgive me for what I'm about to do

It‚Äôs really good

This blows my mind!!! I'd buy that in an instant, I love genie too hahahah!!

I will. Thanks. Takes a hell of a lot more skill than sitting in a bush or spinning like ballerina on crack.

Once I won a bounty game as Shelly because enemy Gene pulled me in in the last second (I had my super)

Bro my mini account has been playing since day one of beta (June 15th 2017) and has no legendaries. So, no, your case is not normal. It has way above average pull rates.

Tbh I probably would have upvoted him if he had said seige....

Thank you thank you thank you. Just THANK YOU! Haha thanks for the comment.

Nice!

Ah! Gotcha. Thanks for the quick reply.
---
I don't get how this is funny to people. Posted 100's of times per week and is just some low effort karma farm. Just need some title saying the lines of "took my 69 hours" or "i'm the new leonardo". Doesn't anyone else agree with me?

So stupid of you you, to steal other People's art

Carl is also unique

Lol this post is amazing üçø
