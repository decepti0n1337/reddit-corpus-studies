This is why i love supercell. Their attention to detail is amazing
---
---
---
Same
---
A bit like Sandy. I was not expecting him to sound like Colt at all, but they're almost identical. His voice lines match, at least
---
It fits her
---
Nice artwork, here are som tips from a 12 year old artist:
---
-Try adding more intense shadows, i use a sort of ‚Äútrick‚Äù where I draw the normal shadow and then a bit of cell shading over it
---
-add some clearer highlights 
---
!Very important thing I realized too late!:
---
If you‚Äôre planning on doing a character that stands out you can use any sort of background, just make sure the character is separated from it
---
If not then draw a own background wich might take a while but is worth it
---
So basically:
---
More intense shading and highlighting
---
Either uninteractive or interactive background
---

---
Hope this helped
---
Morris need a buff ? Please god no, he is REALLY insane right now, he don't need anything.
---
I saw the origanall it was good this won is still good i feel relly bad fore the backlash so tacke my upvote
---
not funny didn't laugh
---
discounted token doublers= more worth it
---
just save your gems for discounted token doublers, so no
---
or your just a heavy gemmer and you don't want to wait then it is worth it
---
I'd rather forget it, thanks
---
Ya this totally isn‚Äôt a joke
---
they must remove this map,its not fun.
---
nice

Emz is vsco. She also says ‚Äúur not getting a friendship bracelet‚Äù and ‚Äúslskskskskksks‚Äù
---
Ok boomer
---
what? can you explain further
---
Then...just nerf carrion crow? /facepalm
---
Why why and why?
---
I got dragon knight... *angery noises*
---
I mean... I once spawned next to lot of powercubes and bot was next to me
---
Next thing i knew, it chathed away
---
nice drawing
---
Not nice, didn't nice-d
---
Hold up hold up man, you didnt do the math.
---
Next thing you know El Fuego lasts longer than Leon's super
---
Bufding invisaheal does nothing bc now leon wont be able to do anything w his super unless he has speed ao tge nerf cancelled out the buff and hell suck w o speed sp
---
Ipppphhhoooonnnnnneee 11 (I wish I had that phone tho) nice drawing
---
Guys I have not been on this reddit or the brawl app since tick came out. What did I miss?
---
it is fair, matchmaking depends on your trophies,not power level, and it means the Frank is "good" if he got 460 with power 4
---
BEGONE
---
I agree with the problems that had not been solved yet. Just here to say that crow's star power was  completely useless. Now maybe we can use it
---
yes
---
Spike is still better than crow
---
If you divide the cost by the number of boxes, you get 40 gems per mega box. That makes it 30 gem saving if you do the deal.
---
F2p players can get gems
---
Wow that‚Äôs high. Sounds higher than mythic chances even. I have two legendaries, both acquired around 0.08% chances. But I‚Äôm lucky, others have a percentage like yours and none. That‚Äôs the thing with probabilities, there is always going to be someone who doesn‚Äôt get them even after years...
---
Im not giving you a freindship bracelet. (something like that)
---
We do know it is this but I think this is not the final artwork for the second
---
these balance changes just keep getting worse and worse
---
Bibi: Once again, another nerf. I stop playing as the game started getting repetitive, but maybe it‚Äôs time to buff other characters that she has outshined rather than nerfing her to the ground?
---
Primo: I really don‚Äôt see why we can‚Äôt comprehend this. Nobody cares about el fuego, as long as i‚Äôm moving faster with meteor rush, i‚Äôm using it. Why? Because it makes up for an area that el primo lacks in, charging / recharging his super. I don‚Äôt need extra damage, either rework it or get over it.
---
Leon: Same as primo, make invisiheal useful or get over it. The movement speed makes leon better, not healing when it‚Äôs unlikely you will even be taking damage. Buffing invisiheal was also no excuse to to nerf the super. He isn‚Äôt even that strong so i don‚Äôt know what your goal is.
---
Brock: It just seems like when it comes to this star power there is generally a lack of comprehension. Nobody cares about making a small circle of flame that people will hardly ever walk in. That doesn‚Äôt even take the slightest drop of effort to understand. Even worse it‚Äôs just a double edged sword. You‚Äôll keep increasing the damage till it becomes so OP against stationary targets to the point where it has to be nerfed. Rework it or forget it.
---
Crow: Playing with fire and we all know it. Why don‚Äôt we give him buffs that will make him useful, like a slightly increased super charge rate, rather than buffs that will make him more annoying. Doesn‚Äôt take effort to understand.
---
Darryl: I just find it funny that everyone knows that darryl‚Äôs steel hoops should never be below 30 percent, and yet it always ends up that way. Stop changing it and fixed the things that are actually wrong with him. As for rolling reload, same as primo, same as leon. Nobody cares. People use steel hoops because it helps darryl improve in an area he lacks in. Instead of aimlessly making changes, let‚Äôs use our head to see what we can do to improve darryl‚Äôs second star power. Since darryl is generally weak without his roll, we should consider making rolling reload into a star power that helps darryl when he doesn‚Äôt have his super charged. 
---
Poco: This one is a personal opinion, but is just like to see poco reworked as a whole. He‚Äôs just so simplistic to the point where it‚Äôs boring, and it reflects on his star powers as well.
---
Spike: It‚Äôs honestly just a general lack of intelligence when it comes to balancing this brawler. Spike has a star power that literally hits people just because you in his main attacks vicinity. You literally can‚Äôt dodge it, so what do you think needs to be done?
---
I don‚Äôt expect everyone to agree with what im about to say, but it‚Äôs really the general lack of results that have made this game boring. Nobody needs a brawler made from recycled parts, spend your time adding things that will actually improve this game, not just add to it. Clubs have no purpose, the trophy road is horrible, daily rewards aren‚Äôt even anything worth batting an eye toward and so much more.
---
Not fair! You got me!
---
Well, shucks! It HAS been a while since I updated it! Idk, would you say I'm beyond subpar?
---
Sorry for the repost but I just wasn't comfortable with the gross incest stuff...
---
Next time I'll try to hold my tongue before jumping to conclusions.
---
Hell yeah.
---
I'm just saying it is unfair because my frank is at power 4 and his is at 8.
---
Someome called me?
---
Don‚Äôt forget Leon getting a voice
---
Why
---
discounted token doublers still more worth it
---
But i bet ppl will still ise carrion crow more id honestly know
---
I prefer Spike but Crow‚Äôs gotten a lot of nice buffs. And he‚Äôs getting buffed again in the update. Spike too but only to his healing super.
---
The code to the template guy is r/RITOMB
---
I saw the origanall it was good and now i see this wher you fixsed it up it relly good im sorry fore the coment but mortis is her unkle this is relly great art i hope you keep up the great work
---
Oh look, are you a brazillian?
---
&gt;Doesn't have Sandy yet. 
---
Relatable, and that's the most sensible part.
---
Lmao
---
She's a mf vsco girl not even bs is safe
---
But it isn‚Äôt as of right now.
---
He shaved beard for us!! Press F to pay respect for his beard
---
I would say he should receive a 0.5s or 1s buff to invisibility duration
---
The doritos...
---
Mortis, B-B-Bringer of ants!
---
Nita buff is shocking
---
F
---
Drew (cr cm) also dyed beard for royal ghost costume
---
wow, complaining about getting a legendary boo hoo
---
I have max piper with only ambush (but its broken now so thats cool). Thats my only max brawler, im pretty lucky I have that 1 star power
---
Its tomorrow i think
---
I love darryl
---
Odd how the entire subreddit was once knee deep in ‚Äúgive us Leon VOs‚Äù memes, then...

More destruction and more shellys? Ah shit, here we go again.

how is it not worth it
---
They dint show the trophy road
---
Poco?
---
Think she's a VSCO?
---
Developers never shares things with us because it can get scraped
---
Nah he was just 2 power points away from maxing brock
---
You can actually get 213+ upvotes
---
Darryl actually feels fine without voice lines. I wish they hadn't gave Leon any voice lines, honestly.
---
I also do but I‚Äôm not a tick main
---
Oh now i understand.
---
I didn't want voice lines for Leon :(
---
Nice
---
Ever tried solo?
---
Spike is definitely not the worst after this nerf it‚Äôs Leon
---
My only critique is her magic eye. It‚Äôs not up to date
---
Yeah, I'm disappointed that they are having her depart from the generally benign yet entertaining voice acting that they have had done in the past.  I really don't appreciate the blasphemy, personally.  Hopefully it was just an oversight and they'll be willing to change out the questionable soundbites if enough people express their dissatisfaction.
---
Can you explain me? Plis
---
Then yes, those 550+ brawlers got pulled down
---
i got 8 seconds once, a mortis self scored twice
---
Heavy Firebrand (from Gargoyle Quest) vibes going on. I dig it.
---
Brawlers above 550 will lose a certain amount of trophy depending on how much higher. You can check the exact details for each of ur brawlers by tapping on their ranks in the character select.
---
[removed]
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
As a voice
---
I think he was such a mysterious boi without it :(
---
Thanks
---
Spike should not have a voice. He is a cactus, and a voice would ruin his charisma.
---
I‚Äôm already making a drawing about size. Yur not the only one who has this in mind
---
We crow mains have been getting excited, but watch in a months time our era will be over.
---
sorry, i didn't know. haven't played brawl in a few weeks
---
But it fits him, a little boy cheering and celebrating. You expect him to be all dark and mysterious? Personally I don't mind and am just happy that he has a voice.
---
Excuse me
---
Is the bubble gum the sun in the background
---
Wow.....5 years
---
Fake?
---
It‚Äôs still just going to be pop super and get a kill against most brawlers in the game. Especially with first starpower
---
Sorry it isn't
---
Anyone getting undyne vibes here
---
Just me?
---
Ok
---
This will only slightly change his balance lmao. Just make him less frustrating to play against if you aren‚Äôt a shotgun character
---
He could be if he got any buffs
---
I answered this before, I was searching for a flair which says "fun fact" or something like that, but I don't find it, so a I was going to put nothing, but I accidentally select "idea" (and I don't notice like 5 hours after post it) so... it's a fact
---
I like the voice, just thought it would be a little deeper. But some of his lines just sound really uncharacteristic to me
---
[deleted]
---
That's at power 1
---
You‚Äôre not wrong.
---
I downvoted because you did the brawlers for lvl 1 not lvl 10 why tho?
---
AHA! You thought you can trick me? I see that ‚ÄúXcQ‚Äù at the end! Ain‚Äôt getting rick rolled today!
---
Most people have all non-legendary brawlers unlocked by 13k, just keep playing, brawler chances are influenced by brawl boxes which you can only get over time.
---
Exactly
---
Should people be smurfing? Also, does it make sense for people that have 15k players playing with 9k players, which have less experience, skill, and comprehension of team coordination.
---
I also called social security on you have fun being in jail!
---
How is this a trick shot? You just passed it between your opponents like any normal goal
---
That's most likely what happened but im not trying to carry people that don't know how to play the game
---
Indeed
---
I love the question he had, because it seems so unbelievable that they sound like this lol.
---
You expected Spinel? xD
---
First meme about his voice that made me laugh
---
Do u still luv rosa?
---
Yep. I was commenting this a million times a day. LEON DOESN'T NEED A VOICE. He's better without one. I also predicted they would make it annoying.
---
New game?
---
Plz give it to me. I really need it. People are making fun of me and bullying me just because i dont have 10,000 trophies. I try my hardest, but i don't get much time. so please, please give it to me. i dont wanna get bullied anymore.
---
It takes about two days for youtubers to show sneak peaks then the day after that update.
---
It's Graveyard Shift, which is pretty much the old game mode life leech.
---
What is this
---
This is how 200IQ see it,and down there,are hoe 50IQ sees it
---
Damn that sucks, try reposting this somewhere in the afternoon and not at night, it might just get a little more attention.
---
He's trolling. If you follow the link, you'll see.
---
Sandy is 12 bUT TRUE
---
Leon is My second fav brawler and this made me so angry
---
I'm trying to say that it's not Supercell's problem. If the community is going to be ignorant and impatient, that's on us. They make brawl talk to hype us up and let us prepare so we aren't surprised or confused.
---
And boss have 10%
---
tbh everytime i played ls and died i spawned at the far left of the map while everyone is fighting in the right side
---
what the fuck is this
---
I don't think they will nerf him anymore
---
It just 40 damage nerf, and ambush is still very strong
---
r/OffendedSnowflakes
---
Bro chill it's just a... Holy shit...
---
All im gonna say is that im probably gonna play with sound off now
---
I will not wait for the update.In my country the update it is going to happen in 10am.And in this time I'm in school
---
he's literally a child y'all making him out to be some stoner who hangs outside a 7 Eleven ready to shoplift a Ring Pop
---
i have mixed feeling for jessie tbh. fuck her bounce attack and just her in general in big game but for actually makign your shots hit that fukin' crow is quite the hard work
---
The THICC RICO wins
---
What a nice gardener
---
Her super is trash
---
Why?
---
Maybe,cuz sandy got released at 3am last update,maybe its the same as 8-bit,1 day after,but if im correct... :)
---
A slight buff. Like a reload speed buff from 2.4 to 2.2 seconds.
---
Interesting you may have started another copypasta shit storm
---
üëç
---
Umm not sure I have max crow with 13k trophies over all, he is very strong up here and believe he should be being nerfed
---
If you seriously think that shelly is op and need a nerf then you are definitely below average
---
And a 19% speed boost to Homerun
---
Nobody:
---
Emz:oh my goooood!
---
for carrion crow damage buff is 29% IF opponent is  below 50% health. say that happens half the time, that's 15% damage buff for crow. on the other hand extra toxic provides 16% damage reduction.  so extra toxic is already better in 3v3 as it can usually provide 16 or 32% damage protection for all of your teammates, whereas carrion crow is better in 1v1 modes. that went straight up 20% which is huge.
---
incendiary was already better in heist and siege due to 1000 extra damage per rocket, they can simply buff the radius to make it good enough in other modes but they made it deal even more damage. this doesn't make it any better in other modes but it's even stronger in heist and siege. 
---
spike star power was considered top 5 to top 10 when it only had 500 healing per second. it had the limitation that you can't simultaneously heal and trap your opponent as he will be too close to you and may kill you.now it provides enough health that you can do it simultaneously. what do you think it will be ranked now. curveball will get nerfed as he is used alot on top ladder and this is the preferred star power like 95% of the time. curve would be lowered to make it dodgable or reduced speed of spike. 
---
de capo was good, it had the limitation that it was good mainly when you had a tank(rosa,bull ,primo , shelly with super etc ) teammate  as they can push back opponents while you heal them. now you have to face tanks that have 2400 quick  healing available at disposal plus 3000 burst heal super. this is super annoying especially in gem grab (cause you will lose control of middle) and brawl ball( tanks can walk the ball in unless you got stun/knockback) 
---
leon is rarely used in competitive now days. he is mainly good in lone star and showdown because people don't keep track of you so they don't expect an invis leon coming after them. in 3v3, if the leon is missing for too long that's a hint that he is coming and all 3 start checking around, not to mention leon has to fight in melee range and he can't fight 3 people at the same time. his invis got nerfed in siege too. he can still be used in lone star and showdown but he is much worse is other modes.
---
I see your point but maybe less days between Brawl Talk and the update wouldn't let the hype fade. It's not really being impatient (as I agree that most people's problem is this) but I personally kinda gets excited less and less
---
Yaa a midpitched voice just pretty casual one
---
I am also rocking a OnePlus btw then
---
But still it‚Äôs epic
---
Tara + Mortis = EMZ
---
#HOW WOULD YOU KNOW THAT
---
True
---
##YES WTH
---
Leon will get a voice on this update
---
&gt; Why is he got nerfed???
---
It's all out of their control though. They have to release the brawl talk early because they have no clue when the update will be approved. It could be one day after BT, or it could be 3+, but they don't know. They would rather it be too early than too late.
---
That's real?
---
Since base stats are poor most of the time
---
(Maybe not poor now)
---
D O W N V O T E
---
Yaa I agree
---
I'm sorry but that's such a bad way of thinking. Legendary or not every brawler should be balanced, not nerfing a brawler because they're hard to get just skews things
---
Happy cake  day üç∞
---
Feels bad man
---
OH YEAH
---
Oof
---
#noice
---
Looking forward to it :)
---
No, stop, I‚Äôm Jewish!
---
I thought the update was always 3 days after Brawl Talk, correct me if I'm wrong, that's what I keep reading everywhere to the continuous "When is the update?" questions üòÇ
---
Sneekee time!
---
same i was just a little mad
---
He got the first part of his remodel, which was the animation rework. They planned to remodel him completely at a later date, but nothing has happened yet :/
---
More often then not, it is, but it hasn't always been. It ranges between 1-3 days, so it's out of their control.
---
**pulls out an AK69**
---
Orb speed buff, she will shoot faster
---
69% nice
---
:'(
---
That hits very hard
---
Frank use rate in the new enviroment drops to 0%
---
I am from Russia
---
Change this to dynamike
---
noice
---
But with Leon not maxed he is trash!
---
Yeah he's already the worst out of the 4 legendaries...
---
*And where is Curveball nerf? Spike again dodging every balance change
---
Definitely one to play on mute with
---
f
---
It do be like that
---
 I wanted to say that but ok
---
Lol
---
Well they're brother and sister
---
Pretty nice a good first step :)
---
Before: give spike voice :(
---
After: EW WHY YOU GIVE SPIKE VOCIE WHYY
---
Fuck u
---
Elbows look like that to otherwise yeah haha
---
Yet, no Mortis or Frank buffs
---
F for our barrel boi
---
 ü•á
---
Made me laugh
---
same mortis gang rise up
---
Wow that‚Äôs a great idea! Love it!
---
hey man have thought about a bibi kill bill kinda skin? :]
---
1 tile gaps... please fix them. But it doesn‚Äôt look bad
---
but they let you win
---
it's nerf or nothing
---
SHAME ON THAT PIPER
---
I am confusion
---
Don‚Äôt go in that profile
---
Wait how did you know? The update isn‚Äôt out yet
---
you did nothing tbh
---
crow already got buffed 5 times in a row
---
What the...
---
Wrong site buddy
---
Well lets see ticks use rate and win rate basically plumetted after the balance change and sandys was of course op.
---
Yeah lotta stuff coulda been done, glad to see my girl penny gettin some love tho
---
nice meme
---
I started playing Brawl Stars in december 2018, what's Life Leech?
---
#stopnerfingleon
---
Stfu hater
---
Same here but I'm like what supercell came up with.
---
Lets spread this news through Leon gang
---
#AND I OOP SKSKSKSKSKSK
---
Filthy Warframe meme, good message
---
did emz really need a buff?
---
I was trying to get super from deryl then kill ok
---
no I mean the Brock was shooting at you after he spun so it was okay to kill him.
---
Old model my man
---
Ye
---
Rosa is my name, botany is my game, seeking for the boss is distant,  up until you do, it will already be nonexistent.
---
I know but he was falking about the strength of brawlers and sandy being the only decent one
---
*cries in leon*
---
every update nerf leon .. just stop crow is way better now ...
---
Hat. Period.
---
I am not. You post a video where you were doing team with a Brock so stfu
---
Nibblinghamster.gif
---
still, ive  seen it enough times myself to know that he can kill most by 3 hits while youd need at least 4 to take him down, which imo should be the opposite
---
yay :D no more 6 hp left on box!
---
get that every day
---
They will and they won't stop
---
But he got a girlfriend!
---
No
---
Poor spike :(
---
You must be a Reddit light theme user to be able to see this lmao
---
Yeah I got 6m 30 but was a incredible match
---
R.O.L.F (Robot Of Large Fists)
---
A smaller, fast low hp robot with a single punch attack called piston punch, dealing a lot of damage per hit, but slow reload.
---
Super would simply be a triple piston punch called crushing combo
---
Sp could be along the lines of extra hp, or faster reload rate
---
Some lines:
---
Feel the piston!
---
Let's punch this out!
---
Let me give you a hand!
---
so the right way to play is to not attack the bot a lot? The right way is to always attack the bot and not waste your ammo on others unless they are near you with low hp
---
it didnt do enof damage to any1 else
---
Time to insanely push Poco bro, but I‚Äôm always afraid when they are overbuffing my favorite star powers/brawlers because after them being OP some little time, they start nerfing and nerfing them as though Supercell punish them for being OP:((
---
he is decent now, but i latest buff is dumb, shields protect you for ~30% of dmg, and they defend only you and require activation ( using super, charging bar ) he blocks 20% of dmg of enemy, and that also affects dmg they do to crows teammates, and all you need to do is hit enemy ( its 4 s debuff if remember correctly, longer than protective pirouette, and steel hoop which have less than 4 s duration )
---
He is for star points.
---
Nah
---
Colt is just a worse Rico
---
10k trophies, 600 brawler trophies, shelly in every BB match, SD match and on maps that have at least small bush formation
---
Lol gayyy
---
Not everywhere, just in Big Game
---
poco be cheating on rico
---
chill the fuck out???? did a vsco girl kill your entire family????????????
---
Did I hear 43 powercubes nita with a bear that has 100000000000 health?
---
There is a magical genie, an arcade machine who's gone rogue, a Frankenstein's monster, a literal crow-man and you are freaking out about Shelly's style like everything else is fucking perfect
---
Very epic.
---
the piper nerf is not bad she will be still decent
---
Happy cake day
---
Poco finally got his girl after 2 long years
---
It is more needed which is not a buff.
---
You clearly dont understand what a buff is
---
It just makes leon more star power dependent which is not a buff
---
Blyatiful
---
go to their discord i guess
---
wow I thought it was just for Mortis Mortuary at Showdown
---
I know, I see I saw that they changed the gold Mecha Bo skin. And it looked like the skin when Mecha skins were launched. So I puted it here
---
Really, WHY Supercell??
---
They arent though u still got the skin just beecause a different color of the skin releases doesnt make the original version crap
---
I a. not sure if it will stay until the real update comes, maybe just development versions, cuz i really miss the old cross
---
It wasn't enough, and unless a Jessie boss is bad or just unlucky, they can easily hit 2.5 - 3 minutes and that's just op
---
So why is Gene doesnt say "ABLAHABLAHABA" ?
---
Sad
---
Happy Cake day
---
hold down here im not here to make some controversy about Update here
---
Oop I‚Äôll buy it
---
Well since you know that they will anyways I guess this can be considered just adding to the spam.
---
Let's not forget those full-fledged 8Bit Duo Showdown battles. That thing made the entire arena trench warfare.
---
Make more this is goodüëç
---
well i‚Äôm trying to stop the spam not be the spam
---
the files are stored in /data/app/com.supercell.brawlstars-1/ i guess root access is needed
---
Thx xP
---
8 bit im spikes super,shelly shell shock super in emz's super=ONE SLOW BOI
---
Thank uuu
---
Now that's creepy. r/imsorryleon
---
Thx x3
---
Thank you ^_^
---
i ask where ü§Æ
---
That's how Leon should sound. He is a kid.
---
How do you know they did?
---
I shoudnt laugh that much when mortis got slam lol
---
Few?
---
Myself
---
you literally just got done saying you know they will anyways. Therefore you added to the spam knowingly. How is that trying to stop it?
---
Now nita is gonna be op and Im gonna take advantage of this to bully yall sneaky bitches
---
wait they ALREADY removed the cross?
---
Blue pilled comment
---
It‚Äôs totally Juvia from Fairy Tail so her design gonna be the same I guess
---
This is my idea for an Invisiheal rework:
---
Leon will gain 2000 health worth of overheal when super wears off. This extra health will go away automatically after 5 sec or when he takes 2000 dmg.
---
i said they will as in them going to before i posted this
---
How ironic. People from r/leongang say otherwise.
---
THE FUDGE U SAY TO ME U LIL SHIT
---
My friend at 6k was complaining that now he has to get to 8k
---
He was like:
---
"Wtf I just got to 6k now I have to get to 8k ughhhh"
---
(Îàà‚Ä∏Îàà)
---
ok
---
I‚Äôd prefer him without a voice. What is a sentient cactus supposed to sound like anyway
---
Its too late...
---
Try using punctuation marks next time.
---
Star powers should not do more damage than main attack
---
Thousand lakes and got maze too
---
Pretty damn cool uh ?
---
No its not. He mentioned photo.
---
love how emz says "i'm just here for the trophies..." XD
---
Luckily I wake up at 5:30 for work.  
---
Staying up for a 3am update doesn't make much sense anyway, better to just go to sleep early and wake up at 3. Then you can actually play for awhile instead of eventually crashing.
---
Today... right here... right now... I‚Äôll love again...! I‚Äôve already found someone...
---
Piper is actually pretty dandy if you focus on killing and maybe opening up the walls in front of the goal
---
Atleast you guys can make noise unlike me
---
what is he suppose to be or where is he from ?
---
It's happened to me when I was at 6k trophies and my friend is 2k trophies he got spike
---
Playing with randoms be like:
---
Yay
---
I suck so bad at drawing but I like it
---
Actually in the old lore from beta it‚Äôs said he is half human half crow
---
Leon: sup bois i got a voice, sandy: same, crow: *same awnser*, spike: am i a joke to you
---
He sounds sorta like a brat, which I honestly like. He probably uses his invisibility powers to play pranks on people and show off lmao
---
emz: i'm just her for the trophies...
---
me: hilarious XD
---
She may be descended from the mythical race of endermen. The arm length is correct for that.
---
He is one of the weakest brawler in the entire game. He deserves a buff.
---
Finally someone who agrees with me
---
Well i would feel bad if i clickbaited.... It's just wrong
---
Cause he‚Äôs a plant
---
It's not your fault,the people that are making this seem like a huge deal make this look like it's a sin on earth
---
*cries in boom beach*
---
Meet Daddy long legs' worthy opponent - Shelly long arms
---
He seems extremely strong in solo modes, and I could pretty much pick and choose who died when I got the super.
---
*i'm sugar and spike*
---
I like the gift of light
---
Hi man
---
I think calr says theology not geology
---
Yup keep playing with that mortis who self goal and you will be here in no time
---
I am the 666th like

Oh yeah, he made Brawl kars

May i ask why?

I agree, but it hasn't happened yet, which is what I'm saying.

I once saw a mortis among 9 shellys in lone star
---
Why dont supercell give leon different super
---
Leon is already the worst out of the 4 legendaries...

But the real question is where spike nerf? Damage nerf? Curveball?

Carl is your lowest...I'm disappointed

What does clipping mean

You have to change the text. This wouldn't nake the meme good but it would make sense because this is how the format works. The text on Joe in the background needs to intimitdate the guy
---
That‚Äôs not a diaper, that‚Äôs like... leggings but only to the knees? They only reason she has them is because in beta all she had was the top and a black void under her

---
Flare does not check out
---
Spike is kinda too
---
Lmao fr
---
My sister says that (and I oop) and I hate it

Yeah but leon wasnt op and nobody complained. We need ti start a buff leon movement like crow mains did

Dont dare stare at me *AUTO AIM!*

well, now they added it

I'd rather not have Gene 2

this is worse than night witch mortis

it just depends on your luck how much are your legendary chances and trophies?

That tick culd ruin some childhoods

He thinks we're stupid....

this reminds me of a time we had to do a play and my friend who dressed up as a potato said "i'm a potato!"

Think about mortis looking at you with the grin... muahahahahaha!!
---
thank you sam for the kind words! &lt;3
---
Oooo spicy!!
---
She's just standing there, menacingly....
---
But the super time nerf is to big because its gonna make him without a star power a bad brawler
---
Yeah, if they just nerfed the projectile speed of the shurikens, Leon would be pretty balanced.
---
Bloody Wicked!!!!!

Frank is not getting any remodel ‚Ä¶ he just got a new default skin custom üëï‚Ä¶

Nice!!!!!

Sandy is creepy, but good job

Its not bad, just unoriginal...

I‚Äôm getting some daft punk vibes

Dude you must not have Leon

Im sure everyone catch that long ago, nothing new here

How about a nerf

If u look closely, the frank super clearly hit mortis

This. This is the best. I don‚Äôt need anything else
---
thanks! youre supportive kirin! :3
---
yes, yes. this exactly, could not be worded in a simpler way
---
I can't say "so cool" coz Sandy is a fiery imp so I'm just gonna say "that's hot"

see ya in hot, bro

Put voice in dynamikes chicken

hey Emz what do you think about the fact that your uncle sometimes wears a dress and uses lipstick?
---
Im interesed and weireded out at the same time
---
How the...
---
This is by far the most retarded post I've ever read. Thank you very cool.
---
Im pretty sure he remained the same, but with some more details just like normal Frank
---
Its a skin. Plz no
---
I enjoy it, it's one of my favorite map. And i'm pretty sure i'm not the only one. Stop having a blind bias of something
---
No it was confirmed
---
Does anyone know when the update is coming out everyone is saying wendsday but idk
---
Well you surely are not ready for real world yet buddy
---
Repost !!! In case you don‚Äôt know it‚Äôs already been done by someone !!

Enjoy his 7 seconds of invisibilty

Never thought I‚Äôd see the day where people are asking for a crow nerf and Leon buff.

and the last one

Well pants dont talk so..

Repoooooort

No mustache

No u

When you realize he got nerfedüò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠ü§£

exactly.

but tbh leon is going through a beta-mortis kind of crisis so im kinda neutral on that aspect, maybe he needed it, maybe he just, doesnt (shrug)
---
Sad but true
---
Real for rosa too
---
Isn't you just don't know how to play in that map? it's not a luck at all since the minecart didn't spawn randomly, all you need to do is stop running into rail when there's a minecart
---
very cool
---
Cool
---
Communicating like animals and communicating like human are two different things.Our crow talks as a human and not as an animal this is what I meant when I said that he can talk.I don't want super cell to make spike talk,but I want them to give him sounds just like Tara,tick, gene etc
---
Stop reposting

I don't know man. She is slowly falling out of the meta again like in pre Band-aid times. It's hard man. I think they should reduce Band-aid charge time to 15 seconds

Hey I made it before this I swear
---
Me: *internal screaming*
---
the mega box special offer is worth it no matter why. even if you don't get either star power or new brawler, you get at least more power points and coins to upgrade your brawlers.

Ksksksksksk omg

keep trying

fellow spike, do insult our brethren
---
This was made like a month ago

Poco is not Mexican,he's Spanish.

It was only a joke, however if a poll was done I am certain a huge mojority would be in favor of it being completely removed from the game.

Thanks I hate it.

One tip. Dont make a habit of doing the video with only text. Try to actually talk. You will get a couple subscribers but you wont grow if you keep that up.

These youtubers get the video a little early so that they can analyse it

That's how old Brawlers like Colt get power crept tho

Spike will never get a voice and he never will be muhahahaha

Sorry, Spike machine broke

Let's not forget the fact that this sub downvotes anyone for saying teaming is viable or for using No Hat Mortis
---
YOU serve the soviet union

Bruh

And.... I should care whyyyy?

Sandy looks like Rambo

That means we have to join and play graveyard shift for the whole time it's there so It becomes permanent

---
I finally meet the artist behind the rule 34...
---
Talent outside pron drawings = 100, nice.
---
yep
---
Nope. I feel his  reload is just too slow for that little damage, health and range he has.  Even for support, he has too little health and range to even do stuff. And if legendary aren't stronger, why are they so rare?
---
Showdown is a mode meant to get the highest place no matter what, this includes teaming, bushcamping, etc.
---
Sandy's a he
---
Hell no. Sandy is a support brawler and is fine as is.

This is cursed

# Luck System Sucks.

YouTube !!!

they want an update every day because

who wouldn't want 9000 fuckin brawlers
---
What?
---
I agree
---
r/brawlrecruit if you're looking to get the trophies back
---
poor tick  is in the floor
---
You're right. Life Leech favours a really small amount of players and is often very frustrating to play. But at least it not that random compared to other modifiers.
---
Fake‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt believe him
---
Life leach is back as a GHOST
---
Agree,  tbh the chance should increase  0,0050% of each 10 regular boxes,  3 big boxes +1 regular boxes or 1 mega box
---
And also not contains teaming :D I get it. Though, I won't play it much and won't like it
---
He got killed by Nita ‚Ä¶ then he respawned ‚Ä¶
---
don't forget that I already pushed my Leon on high trophies but you'll struggle then to push it as high as me when you get it so I win from that not you
---
Wait WTF!!!
---
r/youbrokethechain
---
Found it myself.
---
hope supercell pay attention
---
I was at 0.21 after i got my 3rd legendary, im at 0.15 so im long past tgat point
---
Ngl it looks like bull‚Äôs shit and I hope you didn‚Äôt spend 5 hours doing this
---
Good meme
---
I don't know why the hell they reverted last tick nerf and rebuffed him. He is the cancer of this game
---
 
---
Now thanks to this nerf his super will be COMPLETELY USELESS. I mean 6s is shit and impossible to use.
---
Leon was already the worst legendary and one of the worst brawler in the game. He would have needed a buff instead
---
Don't be crazy, of course cactuses don't talk. If he did it would be far too unbelievable.
---
Well being patient will not work with a game like this. It has no good or satisfying rewards for players who are hardcore pushers and really neither none of friends or me would play this game if i don't get a legendary at 0.3 Legendary chance
---
shelly - 150, piper - 80, leon - 150, frank - 80(?) and jessie - 10k starpoints
---
1. Listen here you little sh\*t
---
2. the second thing you said isn't true
---
Lol I forgot
---
No. It would have taken him longer to respawn, and when he would have respawned, the message would have disappeared. Also, Cory is playing Piper and the message is showing that Barley has died
---
In this update he is going to have a voice :)
---
Right now I‚Äôm at 0.28 üôÇ
---
[saints row 4 finale] joined the chat
---
no
---
Fantastic idea, aproved by spike gang
---
Well maxing a brawler is so tough. If i upgrade one brawler literally I am bankrupt at that moment!!
---
This game is becoming a huge struggle!
---
I was playing mortis in solo showdown earlier and 4 bulls and an el primo teamed on me.whoever those people are,are ruining brawl stars and need to die
---
what? why?
---
Ty
---
Totally, same thing for me. I didn't like it that much back then but now I'm absolutely fine with it
---
Tomorrow, when shop rotates
---
Sadüò≠
---
Beautiful!
---
But like, with an extremely deep voice
---
They're rare because they have such useful abilities. He's not stronger cause that would make the game really unfair. Also, look at cr, legendaries aren't op or stronger, they just serve certain uses you don't see in other cards. And he has a very fair bit of damage. Maybe a reload buff but that's about it. When he places his super, the area denial is insane so buffs would just make him op. Hes like Tara, he may not be extremely strong, but his super really makes up for that.
---
AH, AH, AH!
---
First emz now skele piper
---
r/engrish
---
Wait my brain instantly thought it was Rico,and i read rico instead of barley.
---
Wow the Bounty one isn‚Äôt hard
---
Hi cronopeirce
---
they said they will make it permanent if the play rate is high
---
#Bruh
---
This is wrong, he costs 80 gems
---
Save the polar bears
---
Crow is cool how he is
---
Yep
---
Costs 150, I have 60
---
So Bibi 2¬∞ SP,  rosa and bull 2¬∞ sp are copys too  cause they have the same mechanic as Darryl 1¬∞sp a shield.
---
At least he's getting an awesome skin this Halloween.
---
No hes not stfu
---
You dont even see leon being played at pro matches and Spike is the best legendary competitively. Only noobs say leon is the best. Spike has better damage than him and can deal alot of burst damage even at mid range and at long range he has those spikes which are really good control and his super aswell.
---
**pulls out cross** The power of christ compels you, demon!
---
Don't give me hope
---
Im at 9.5k all my friends saiy im Lucky
---
Joe mama!!!
---
For Leon, it should've only been "you guys are getting buffs" for Leon
---
Didnt someone else made this?
---
Yea
---
Nice, hope you get one soon.
---
Even before the nerf, spike and sandy were better and they still are.
---
Let's wish SC will change their mind and add it permanently as Everyone is going to love and play graveyard shift a lot.
---
Me:*salutes and cries at the same time*

Piper has the same main attack as Brock and 8but has the same main attack as colt and Frank has the same main attack as Nita just times 5

---
It's displaying, but it's not functional.
---
Nita is Leon's sister...
---
Atleast we got a Leon voice
---
***alabama noices intensify***
---
No. Just make his super go to 7 or 8 seconds again but make invisiheal heal for 800 again. Basically just reverting the changes they made to him is enough.
---
This is the taste of a liar player!
---
what is he doing?
---
they said it will be permanent only if the play rate is high
---
His other account is also in the match as you can‚Äôt exit
---
you can only play it with starpowers so everyone has the same lvl and beginners can't join it.
---
DO IT
---
That sub is dead everyone uses r/okbrawlerretard
---
I have 10k with only 23 brawlers and no legendaries

With 6 power 9 brawlers and 7 star powers

Better than what I could draw, well done
---
I always have been a fan of medical use and for that reason I got it
---
Search for mematic or meme generator in playstore or apple store
---
IDK. Maybe. He showed them.
---
Oh must be a bug or something
---
So irritating
---
do you want  a sad fact?  supercell said that the life leech  will only be in this month   :(
---
Actually want this QOL feature so badly! There's some cool moments and/or clutch plays in the replay that you want to record or see it later or show someone but then you also need to make sure you don't play many matches otherwise it'll go away forever. I wish this is added soon so that we can play uninterrupted and record/see those replays later.
---
why is he having smartwatch
---
Not a bad idea
---
It isn't, it's an old feature removed, where would tieckets expire.
---
The longest meme ever seenüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
I never spend my star points on boxes 
---
I keep them for cool skins
---
I'm kinda confused that should I get shadow Knight Jessie or not
---
Maybe it was his lil' brother turn to play
---
They could be banned, like in some other games like League of legend for exemple.
---
His damage is really high.
---
i have a vivid memory of spike having a very *deep*, black man voice, and it was in a commercial that had brawler raps. I dont quite remember how it went, but i do remember him saying something like "doesn't matter if im attacking or hugging you, ill nail you all the same". Can anyone please tell me im not crazy?
---
r/cursedbrawlstars
---
Troll at maxim
---
Don't worry it is temporary
---
I'm not opposed to fan made skins and cool artwork, but the whole "brawloween art collaboration" is way too over hyped, not to mention most of these skins fucking SUCK! And they aren't the real brawloween skins anyway, so I fail to see the point here. 
---
They all just kind of suck.
---
and a voice

Happy every brawler noises

Wait, it's not CARA SIMON now

a.. voice??

yeah

You're taking about that Invisiheal buff, right?

O?

Not nice

Where can I find them and how do you know

Stop barking
---
No.
---
Dude you‚Äôre tripping Leon hasn‚Äôt gotten a single buff since his release and still gets nerfs every other balance change. At his peak he was untouchable.
---
Yeah ‚Ä¶ maybe
---
I wanted to make the exact same meme r/beatmetoit
---
kairos‚Äô channel
---
I hope he gets even worse.
---
:( as a Leon main this is a sad time..
---
The springs seem useless I don‚Äôt think people would use them
---
Crap, I want the skin, but that's a hefty chunk of gems more then I have, dang it
---
Enemy heads
---
Thats false
---
Nope, Halloween event atm, but possibly Supercell will leave it ingame
---
Wow thx
---
Ya me too I hate it so much
---
np
---
SHe uses social media (that mean reddit is include)
---
He‚Äôs not in pro matches cuz Supercell loves to nerf the fuck out of him and many pro players like Bobby still thinks he‚Äôs good
---
Spike‚Äôs voice should be a chew toy squeak sound effect.
---
I got leon at 6k from a free box in the shop. So I'm lucky
---
He will still remain one of the best characters in the game for Lone Star and SD. His invisibility will always guarantee this place to him until it is reduced to 0.6 seconds.
---
What exactly would these sources be?  I did not understand
---
Will do! My favourite gamemode atm
---
No. Leon deserves it.
---
Is the blind
---
the one thing i am super excited for is the shelly reanimation
---
I dont know how to draw so yeah :D
---
I've heard about that because of a friend who shipped them
---
wHaT sHoUlD wE nAmE iT?
---
Wich day is it for you
---
EEEEEEEEEK! Leon! I thought we were friends!
---
No... I dont think i will
---
His invisiheal buff wasn‚Äôt even much of a buff, since he lost a second to the invisibility duration, they should‚Äôve increased it regardless to keep the healing consistent
---
ehhh :D
---
Brawlers are cute, brawl stars is cute, we are all
---
#CUTE
---
That‚Äôs the starting % i think
---
what he means new model for crow? does this mean a complete change like rico?
---
Some of the brawl stars youtuber show the animation
---
Leon gets a buff
---
Why did Leon get a voice though? He‚Äôs supposed to be an assassin and last time I checked assassins don‚Äôt say talk before, during, or after they kill someone. I know this is unrelated to this post but I just wanted to get this out there and let anyone know who didn‚Äôt already know that Leon is getting a voice.
---
Is not
---
You can still team in Life Leach just shoot each other at same time you wont lose any hp
---
I keep forgetting that people still use this joke which is more overused and annoying than the one with The  El primo in gemgrab
---
I really appreciate you doing this and it looks really freaking cool (would love to learn to draw that) , but not in the Brawl Stars context. I hope you understand.
---
Do you get star tokens for big boxes? I can‚Äôt seem to find the answer
---
What about Darryl's voice?
---
Do you get them to 549 to not lose trophies?
---
OOOOOOH how i dislike Frank. He is waaay to unfriendly and his sarcasm is always out of control.
---
Sorry but my first post didn‚Äôt  get any traction, I‚Äôm the creator, I tried reposting
---
I got Sandy yesterday with that darop rate, hope you get him soon
---
Or a type of Icon in profile
---
How would a stun work in this game? It would be to op.
---
It was trying to ment that is saving boxes to get power points for Emz
---
Huh guess I‚Äôm playing on silent now
---
Bro, don't farm karma. Also who gives a fuck if they were teaming
---
Its stealing, not stoling
---
Does he throw explosive swords?
---
But I wish there won't be Emz stars (if you know what I mean)
---
***rule34 artist looking at this:*** that's interesting
---
Why do you think that? The update is always 3 days after brawl talk. It will be ironic if it won't.
---
for some reason i remembered about that one NES game about von Count that somehow had functioning voice acting (and also smooth ledge grabbing)
---
Alright...
---
I'm in bro let's do it I want it to be in game forever and ever
---
And he becomes human this time.
---
Sadly it is a temporary mode
---
Scrapy: Zzzpppp. Sparky: zzzp
---
Idea: give this idiot brain
---
Air drop
---
What did he say?
---
I uderstand inglish and know inglish but i just cant spell sum words but thanks sum peopall get mad becuse of that but thanks alot
---
New N00bies:Well yes but actually no
---
The thing is, when he gets his super, all brawlers that don‚Äôt have any close range combat skills are dead while he has a long range for a close range brawler. Yeah I understand that he needs to get his super but so does shelly and tara and the other medium health brawlers but they have a shorter range than him. If I was going to balance him, I‚Äôll make his super 8 seconds and make it so that he is revealed for 0.1 second before he supers so that people can stay aware of him. It‚Äôll set a skill cap for players so that either parties will know how to eliminate each other. I‚Äôll reduce the range as well but I‚Äôll increase the damage and decrease the reload speed.
---
He a plant so ok
---
Thiefs valley?
---
I‚Äôd just like to see his animations be smoother. More like Phoenix crow honestly. He‚Äôs clunky right now.
---
Oh yeah. Fair enough. I forgot that it's a premium skin.
---
I wish they wont cuz they are making brawl stars for kids under 2
---
no, either one is correct, idk what these people are saying. cactuses and cacti are both correct.
---
***brawl kars***
---
Yeah
---
the day i got spike seconds after reaching 10k from a regular box and it was 4 days ago
---
I‚Äôm not  karma farming, these teamers got me to lose 9 trophies on my 850 8 bit
---
Well he could at least get some cactus sounds
---
Pushing your brawlers...
---
&amp;#x200B;

Lower.
---
He could also hold a Ban Hammer
---
I feel bad alot of post get stuck in new

Slap till he stop. H a hahaha

Big F for this guy

Go to hell

Leon is to great for you anyway

And you will never get him

And if you have leon you don't deserve him

Why am I laughing

I am at .19something and I haven‚Äôt got my first legendary:(
---
No it isn't fake even KairosTime showed him on his video
---
Yes is guess
---
I came up with it becuse i thot he can throw forks
---
Can somebody make skin versions
---
I wish they Just make brawlers more realistic not more childish but they just can't make proper remodel except for frank and piper

---
Most likely not.
---
Oh, yeah, you can play matches of (example) a Shelly, other 2 brawlers, and in the other team also can be other Shelly
---
Same, people complaining about not having all brawlers at 1500 trophies
---
Those boxes are for the star points to upgrade emz you clever
---
Yeah man, I got the skin with the hat and still waiting for the one without the hat. Idk why they don't just make it interchangeable.
---
On the first few days it will be üòÇ
---
So a brawler can only be used if they have a star power? In that case they need to increase to chance of getting one... I've had 5 brawlers at level 9 for the last month and didn't get a single star power for any of them.
---
There probably will be a halloween pack. I don‚Äôt think anyone knows what it‚Äôll entail till it comes out. If i had to guess I‚Äôd go with $10-$20 with gems and coins
---
this makes me wish we had some sort of brawler that has a turret that acts similar to sparky
---

---
Sandy: . . .

#Yare Yare Daze
---
While you are typing this message
---
At least there won't be Emz stars
---
In case you haven‚Äôt noticed the post is about brawlers with legendary rarity. Shelly does not have legendary rarity. What people think is that she has the power of a legendary. That isn‚Äôt the case here, this post is about the brawlers that classify as legendary which does not include Shelly
---
They better otherwise I will riot
---
Bull does more damage
---
Nah he needs to sound like a very aggresive morgan freeman
---
Wow, thought this was Rico, but hey great artwork!
---
This is what i thought when i Saw emz
---
F for leon
---
Yes
---
No because Leon sucks now
---
Pizza mozerella
---
To me their main attacks only look similar, Same with the super. But the function completely different and have different roles, so while I would also like some more out there concepts I‚Äôm not too upset with emz and can‚Äôt wait to play with her.
---
Nope
---
That's cute
---
Found the person who doesn‚Äôt have Leon
---
But they will make it permanent if everyone love it
---
EPIC
---
wait I've seen this one before but it wasn't mortis
---
Rico got fucking cucked
---
The arabian family
---
The first time in his life where he isn't tired
---
Upvote this guys come on..... it‚Äôs actual quality content.
---
Because an assassin should be able to be sneaky, and sometimes his super wouldn't reach very far without the speed SP. Yeah, the buff to the healing SP is great and all but for a 1 sec time decrease to his super? Yeah, no. I would take the extra time instead. Supercell made a big screw up on this one.
---
Oh yea, don‚Äôt get me wrong. I don‚Äôt hate these new additions but we can expect better quality Brawlers shown from the past. But I will be fair, Emz was dished out very quickly compared to some Brawlers so hey, I‚Äôm not complaining too much.
---
As a frank fan I like it but it's kinda weird because he's human
---
You are not the only one
---
that was same thing with people begging for crow buff
---
now it's overbuffed and now begging to stop nerfing leon
---
It is?
---
Yes because you did it 2 times in a row
---
Yes please
---
All of this effort into this makes all of the other artists to shame
---
It has the pumpkin icon.... definetely all this halloween skins will be limited.
---
Leon, I would nerf his range by 1 tile, nerf his health to 3000, and make his super lasts for 5 seconds but charges every 12 seconds automatically + charge from his main attack, this way he becomes invisible a lot more often but isn‚Äôt invisible for quite as long, and since his health is lower he is more reliant on the invisibility.
---
Go to brawl stars front page, and at the top right corner
---
The matchmaking is based off the trophy count not the brawler level
---
You should make the walls in the back destroyable.
---
And add some power cubes, bounce pads, energy drinks, meteor areas and healing a mushroom area, which overlaps with a poison area.
---
she also looks like a man. Except her face
---
I still hope he gets a cute childish voice.
---
You dare disrespect life leech 2.0?
---
They felt bad about the last patch so they buffed his super to last indefinitely.
---
Look at his name
---
Change da world my final message goodb ye

Took me 2 hours from 570 to 69, might be an issue getting unlucky with people fighting each game other.

You're thinking about the Count from Sesame Street maybe?

hi

Signed. Lets overthrow the current balancing team and hire new ones.
---
Maybe he could throw pieces of pizza instead of shockwaves, wouldn‚Äòt that be funny?! Or the shocks itself contain pizza ingredients
---

---
Wow so Frank is now Daft Punk!
---
Yeah that's the one
---
What did he say????
---
Sandy looks like a depressed adult millenial
---
Stop because the dv team sucks at remodeling brawlers
---
AH, AH, AH!!
---
Yeah lex said it
---
spike is my name hugging people is my game.
---
How can they call the mode "competitive" if it features showdown?
---
Showdown is not fit for competitive play. At all...
---

Leon screaming in pain because he just got hit by the nerf hammer
---
I am so happy that life leech is back
---
Good, I really like the mysterious vibe he sets off. Any voice he is given would be weird
---
im quaking in my boots
---
Not invizible
---
Wtf
---
Instead of nerf return his old hight damage
---
Hƒ±w get you brawler flag (crow, leon...)
---
and I oop-
---
My stupid fucking brain sry
---
I saw someone triple jump in a takedown match at 600 before
---
THAT'S RIGHT I HEARD THE STORY OVER AND OVER AGAIN,
---
Can someone explain what this means
---
During his super he should walk on four '' legs? ''
---
Negative gems that you can buy everything
---
im cool with because i dont have leon
---
sadly it's temporary but they said if everyone loved it, they will make it permanent so it depends on the play rate
---
Sounds like a great idea! Because everyone prefers using the second star power of him which is definitely more useful than creepy harvest
---
im so pissed they are missing an oportunity like this. howcome they dont add a mortis skin on an update like that. wtf...
---
At least they don't remodel because they suck at remodels so bad
---
That‚Äôs what we said last time
---
They remodel them to fit the current theme of the game. And so they can make more/better skins
---
And WHY does leon have to pay the price? he is just a kid in hoodie
---
In the balance changes they are buffing his invisiheal to try and make it as good as smoke trails but if they nerf the duration of his super then the speed will be better for getting to someone
---
finally
---
sick
---
And with that they widen the Gap between Lv. 9 and 10...
---
[someone made a change.org to reverse the nerf](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ)
---
But his speed isn't being increased
---
Gives his super 'Stunning Blow' a whole new meaning
---
why...
---
cuz he stole those candy
---
Stop just wait for it play and it will have supe hight play rate and as the dev team said they will return it as permanent modifier
---
Invisiheal can be good in Brawl Ball or Siege. 
---
If they‚Äôre trying to make more people use invisiheal, they‚Äôre doing a shit job. Nerfing his super Duration will make more people use Smoke Trails.
---
Ok lad
---
well... everyone showed the skin sooo np and ty
---
‚ÄúBrick‚Äù
---

---
200 globally.... we are all probably gonna be like 2000 place
---
Do you realize that you will be supercell's next punching bag for nerfing after they kill leon with them
---
I dunno, I like Mortis the way he is but that might be cause of how much I play him (rank 25 and both star powers). He is good, but only on few maps and requires lots of practice
---
Yes it is you can even triple jump
---
[r/woooosh](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ)
---
You just missed the joke twice mate
---
My friend just started playing Brawl Stars and I‚Äôm scared he‚Äôll get Sandy before I do
---
It not out yet dumb dumb
---
I have decided that I want to die
---
I think my favorite part of this photo is the Starbucks siren logo. these are the things I love to see on this sub I hope you‚Äôd do more in the future!
---
Leon already sucks rn
---
And we know mortis is her uncle so mortis has a brother/sister?
---
And that is my he is overpowered now. Long range and spread, stops healing, fast speed, and both an aggressive and evasive super.
---
they nerfed sandy tho :/
---
repost
---
How about he got a bad Nerf and a bad buff. I think the invisiheal is absolutely uncesarry,and the Nerf as well.
---
I also saw thst but they didn‚Äôt say anything in brawl talk, I think it looks kinda like gene. With the eyes, mouth and forehead.
---
r/leongang is angry as well
---
They are limited time except DJ Frank, and Jessie dark knight is 10k star points
---
yep exactly what i think
---
**he killed me**
---
I'm not mad, and apparently a lot of people in this subreddit hate me now for making a lot of hate posts about Leon. So it's true that hate only breeds hate.
---
Sandy Is like: looks like Someone Wants to die
---
If they don't take 2 seconds to look at the subreddit before posting it, how will they see this?
---
...thgirlA

chuuu
---
Magician's Red!
---
Don't play aggressively. Camp in bushes if you have to.
---
Maybe play other modes some you‚Äôll have more variety for your brawlers so that when showdown is bad for some characters you can play them in brawl ball or something. Also brawl ball is very fast paced and rewarding if you‚Äôre good enough at it.

Idea: Agreed.

---
You play the role of an imaginary character who's undertaking a large-scale quest of some sort. These games typically have warriors, monsters, swordplay, magic etc. Think The Elder Scrolls, Dark Souls, or Bloodborne for example. I suggest you remove rpg from your post.
---

Your writening is very good! The advice is for your improvment, nothing else :)

Of course he gets removed on his birthday month!

---
My friend got killed by a golden mecha crow today lmao
---
*Warning, grammatical errors may occur*
---
Oh wow you went down to -4, looks like this post is in hot right now and this comment gets downvoted because 90% of this sub is just cocky 9-year-olds who never played Life Leech and just jumped onto the hype train to disagree with everyone who doesn't praise Life Leech.
---
Honestly Life Leech was never a outstanding modifier. It, as I mentioned before, favours a really low amount of Brawlers, Brawlers with healing abilities have a massive advantage, bush camping is way too viable and kill stealing makes this modifier even more frustrating.
---
And even though it may seem like Life Leech is a fair modifier because it treats every Brawler equally, it really isn't. You picked a squishy and you spawn next to a Piper? One shot and you're dead for sure. You don't have any boxes close to your spawn? You have to play way too offensive or else everyone is going to outlive you.
---
After they removed it, everyone acted like it was a perfect modifier.
---
 It really wasn't. And don't get me wrong, although it had it's mistakes it was still a really good mode. Almost every single game mode and modifier has massive flaws, not just Life Leech.
---
C mon boys 1 m people post emz at the same time lets do itt
---
This is the smoothest thing i have ever made

God damnit fucking hate it when discussion threads get buried by shitty reposts and lazy memes

This makes no sense

Cyber Spike, THAT'S WHERE FUTURE BEGINS also nice art bro I m just waiting you to make Michael crowson

I see this before

The season ended yesterday, so you got a long way to go buddy,

# SHELLY + 8-BIT = SHIT XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
---
I hope so!
---
My rate was .18 when I started to try and get sandy 
---
400 boxes later and I‚Äôm at .26
---
Remodeling brawlers is creating a new model which is basically like creating a new brawler
---
Dont you think its too much to create 2+ brawler models every update?
---
Congrats dude!
---
I think so i saw a post with maintenance
---
It‚Äôs been a great year for you. Like literally because you were released last December
---
Lol, I just posted this 10 secs ago and got a comment. I wanted 549, because you lose trophies from 550 and beyond, but I didn't want to lose trophies, so I did this. I wanted to comment this, but reddit didn't allow men so I commented right now.
---
they added a new attack animation for dragon knight jessie surprised no one posted a video about it
---
Sure? But those other brawlers aren‚Äôt as similar to Sandy as Emz is. She‚Äôs basically a copy paste of Sandy with a little bit changed. Majority of damage is over time, super is movable but doesn‚Äôt last as long, no invisibility and super slows. Other than that she will play pretty similar to Sandy with rude sands.
---
So even if I don‚Äôt make it into the top 200 I still get star points?
---
ü§ûü§û
---
you want to report people for teaming? lmaooo
---
No I mean you might, just depends which legendary(s) you have
---
Guys he just wants his lollipop...
---
PLEASE VOICE FOR DARRYL thanks üòÅ
---
I like it, although it‚Äôs slightly ruined by the fact that they barely change her face during it
---
Oh geez
---
Agreed. Instead of taking off a second of his duration he should get one more second.
---
N9 mas eskis de brock no mas
---
yup i think you will not gain or lose trophies but you can only play it 3 times per day
---
Brawler: Olf  Leon
---
Class: Sassin

K vrga, esto no es H :vvv

They did both...

Vsco Crow!

I don't even have leon :(

Whats your channel called?

If they were to delete Leon I would be pissed I just got hime yesterday

Good luck ruining other peoples days cuz you failed to ruin mine. Have a great day

---
those are the shitty people who use piper in brawlball. like if they were good ok but no they suck ass as piper
---
i mean peoples will post it because they little kids trying to get upvotes its like w enever seen this before with new brawlers thats gets release
---
My channel is called Jayman-brawlstars
---
So you made a post just to try and woooosh someone.... that‚Äôs just wierd and plus is r/woooosh
---
Frank in brawl ball

Enemy-team-stunned-inator (except when they use super like shelly's, Darryl's or other like that)
---
DANG LMAO
---
I hate how good this skin is because I can‚Äôt afford it
---
i think he will get a voice in the november update cause he is the last one without a voice
---
Thanks man! You truly are the people‚Äôs hero!
---
It was just coincidence. Any app needs to be approved by Apple to push out the update, which usually takes up to two days, stated by either Frank or Ryan (can‚Äôt remember) on their twitter
---
I don‚Äôt see why they need approval to update considering they have had multiple updates already but, yunno:
---
 Apple Things ¬©
---
So it won‚Äôt be gone after the Halloween season?
---
Happens. I luckily got Spike at 5k, but in my defense I grinded a lot to get there. I downloades the game on day 1 of Android beta release, and grinded a LOT of trophies during that summer. And two months after, got da cactus. Dont qorry, you'll get one eventually.
---
Yaaay üòÅ

His bird cant see this rule 34 stuff that why he has his shirt off bc he wants to party and his bird cant see I wonder what the bird is doing in there anyway Bird: rule 34

Does anybody here play btd6? I know I do. (you have to pay for it tho).
---
Ikr with the super nerf leon is only viable with smoke trail by u can get there faster with the small amount of time you have
---
My mom wakes at 5am,if she wakes at 3am too she will make me close the phone

What
---
XD
---
Yup
---
Fucking beggar that can get the hell out of this sub: Am I A JoKe tO yOu
---
I got with this ac with every other brawler  maxed or power 1 and they were all at rank 26.
---
Lol thank tho... Can't help it I don't want to make the brawlers the samr boring thing
---
150 to be exact. new dope pose animation and also for the the attack. honestly i‚Äôm gonna get it in a couple of months im gonna look hot af
---
Playing Sandy and complaining that other brawlers are somehow OP üôÑ
---
Mortis needs buffs or a serious rework, not nerfs.
---
Instead of the second panel use the palpating one where he says ‚Äúa surprise to be sure, but a welcome one‚Äù or maybe task failed successfully
---
It was fun to play tho and the best way to push up trophies
---
Poco: Ready to get Brawled on?
---
Welp you'll def see worse
---
You sure? Not even food... Or water...
---
Probs not tomorrow maybe Thurs. Cause all the other ones were on Thurs
---
This just means that Leon was born in December (global launch) and will die in December (same month)
---
Happy 1 year leon üò¢
---
hmmm interesting
---
cause 10k star points equals to a 300 gem skin
---
Idk what it means lol
---
Haha more to come
---
I feel like this could also work with gene
---
Uno reverse
---
upvote farm...
---
thanks i was mesing around with a stile
---
What would you spend 50k star points on?
---
did you get anything from the mega box tho?
---
I started pushing after I saw the brawl talk. I know it's not a big deal but it still feels good.
---
in help and assistence a man tell me this dont pass in many times but i see like 10 posts like this
---
yep only here for the event
---
10 months waiting for a legendary...
---
UNLOCKS LEON*
---
And I am still waiting...
---
In the strictest sense of close range brawler with a gap closing super, but yeah they are pretty different. Wasn‚Äôt really my intention to relate them but the other guy was insistent.
---
Honestly the 2 brawlers that seemed fitting if they didnt have voices were leon and spike but spike just gives off a üóø vibe
---
Mm not really that im salty just cuz I dont have it. Its just annoying how my sister got it at 3k and she has his star power smh.
---
That Shelly super strat is pretty obnoxious, at least the ep primo jump, it was quite hard but the Shelly super is just annoying
---
Plus imo, leon is sorta trash atm so not looking forward to unlocking him. Id rather unlock smth else
---
Me : _says anything hateful about Leon and get 59 downvotes_
---
I was hoping she would be 5000 star points I knew she would be more expensive than linebacker bull but she didn't really feel it was mecha bo tier... That is until 8 saw the crossbow animation. Still think it is less than 10k though but whatever it is free anyway.
---
~~Am yet to open. I don't think I'll get anything though cuz I just got mortis a few days back.~~
---
Nothing special.

O
---
Can't do "15% chances" because that's RNG. It will be unfair.
---
This is against TOS so I‚Äôd be careful about posting that kind of thing here
---
Congratulations
---
I think that means new brawler ideas
---
Easy on android, difficult on iphone
---
I just noticed the background
---
T
---
It's 150 gems. Which is amazing because Leon gets gets a custom animation, attack animation (Bones instead of Shurikens), and a wolf howl whenever he goes invisible
---
Did you attack people?
---
Spike won‚Äôt get a voice because he already has a voice. He just makes cactus noises. Have you ever heard a cactus before? Sounds exactly like what Spike says.
---
Frank said that if the win rate is high and players are loving the game mode, it will become permanent. I hope it will!
---
CaN wE CoPyStRiKe pEwDiEpIe?

Wait are you saying its a better or worse version

These are icons provided by supercell to content creators

and sorry for the repost, I had to change it up a bit until it was good!!!

¬ß
---
Now that I have leon's voice I wish he was with spike.
---
I‚Äôm saying that Emz super is so much better than spike that spike will be useless in the meta.
---
Bibi health nerf is bad i already have trouble pushing in showdow due to no skill shellys and other high damage brawlers
---
Legend has it dynamike is still trying to hit the double
---
Yeah exactly it gives incentive, which is always good
---
Only with speedy star power
---
Oh in that case it‚Äôs perfectly fine I guess

He deserves that

And a vpice

That makes one of us ...

That netfix adaptation is perfect

Oh my god. So leon WAS a demonic creature

When do you think the update will be?

Everyone just needs to play it a bunch. I think it would be a great fit for the ticket event slot for during mon-fri.
