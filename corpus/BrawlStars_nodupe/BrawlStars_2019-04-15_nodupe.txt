When you post it you get 1k upvotes, when I posted it a month ago I get 5 and people saying it’s a dumb idea because it would make gene take no skill

Fraud and forgery is piracy
---
Except they leaked crow buff today soooooo.....
---
Oh? You're approaching me?
---
No one likes teamers
---
Not really brain dead or no-skill, he's just easy brawler to use. But you still need some skills like dodging, patience for ambushing, and apply his super to approach or escape
---
can't wait for the meteor rework

thanks for the comment, I will correct the filter nxt time.

Did you figure it out yet

Read op’s reply

Yes

maybe over convidence?

Sorry better delete it 😅

You all are saying I’m mean but just be honest with yourself. I’m thirteen and could probably draw that in one minute.
---
Looks like the Fortnite skin
---
This is a poor idea
---
someone disagree with you
---
2 reasons: 
---
First one is probably because you didn’t use the idea flair tag, flair tags help people find what they are looking for and if you don’t put one, your post will just get burried and lost.
---
Second reason is that you just drew without giving it any shape or something, I made it look like it’s an actual hit marker.

I dunno man. In siege and brawl ball this think owns
---
***150GEMS***
---
Omg I’m shaking and crying right now. Bo and Pam would never do this 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
---
I would just say: no.. the Game would be broken then.. and brawlers like gene, Tara.. well obviously every game would be useless somehow.. just get one sneaky with Mortis and give it to ur mate like no reason to play gem grab anymore 😅😂😂🤷🏽‍♂️
---
I smell #PESTILENCE
---
Hoooow....
---
For starts the movement speed would be broken, it would also make the mode less consistent as it is already quite strategy based it’s only once you get past insane II that it becomes more strategy. Also you could get people playing both sides to farm coins it wouldn’t be fair.

This is a great idea! Meteors are too predictable and don't affect teaming that much. Also here before this blows up!😂

im 17 he's probably around 10-12 and his drawings are waaaay better than mine
---
*when you realize you can use piper on any showdown map if you're skilled*\- I see pipers on every single showdown map for some reason, even some bad ones. Yes, there are some excellent ones for her, too. I like how you used the open mid and meteors to choose Piper, well played.

He said I could give him whatever I could, so I gave 100 pesos. I was chatting with the kid for a while, he told me he doesn’t have Spike yet.

Why TF would someone downvote my comment . Dude I'm telling you this reddit community is the most toxic

They made a post about making a crow buff chill lol.  They were gonna realease a buff anyway.

I think it defeats the purpose a little bit, Gene is already easy to use but needs some skill to know where it will split and how much

Love who everyone is mortis

-3 Modes of game, one is disorganized because it has 18 letters and the other two are the same thing, what changes is the difference of the elixir oara dragon.

-1 "New" card that was actually pulled from Clash of Clans instead of being made from 0. 
---
-5 New "Skins" that actually only change color to yellow. (Minus the rocket, that's cool)

-New Ui ... Wow, just put all the buttons in one, amazing, completely changed the game ... The Brawl Stars has changed 3 times but nothing compares to that.

They were like he is gone right and then the celebration happens
---
Yes Brawl Stats is very useful. It shows you a graph of your trophy progression of your club and profile, your stats with specific Brawlers, upcoming and current maps and which Brawlers are good in them, and overall has more stats than regular Brawl Stars.
---
no, never
---
if you don have crow or star power brawler this mode become a shit, never bring back him
---
Oh fuck yea that'd be a good idea for a new crow skin

Its terrible. They should give it for free or else no one would ever buy that crap

I guess mortis need little bit of super rechage buff or small amount of damage buff like if you agree
---
Yeah
---
Come back here
---
Lol he isn't the best brawler, he isn't even the best legendary.
---
best value for your gems would be to spend them on token doublers once they are a special offer, it's essentially a mega box for 29 gems

Agreed

For me this map is incredible and beautiful, I hope you like it.

I have no idea cuz I don't have her in any of my IDs but she definately tough to deal with in many modes like gem grab,  brawl ball,  bounty and siege. Moreover, there is very less chance for you to escape alive if you get trapped in her super
---
Not dead But its too crackhead voice or more like mortis XD
---
Also give us a free name change pls papa

this is way too good to be on this sub

Yet again, they nerfed my boy leon
---
Thanks
---
Doesn't make it true even if you repeat it so many times. None of the pros consider him the best brawler in the game and for good reasons.
---
It's not my fault you choose that character.You have enough open field and enough close ranged space.It's a bit from all
---
Wait where did it say?
---
Papa bless

Lol but I unlocked Mortis the day after I unlocked Rico,

But I am not the luckiest. My friend got Leon at 900 trophies.

They did not. Click on your name and you’ll be able to change the color there ;)

Don't listen to the other guy

yay

these people are too *insert word* to understand this meta meme

Sweet, now if you'll excuse me, I'll go sulk in a corner from the concept of my inaccessibility to a legendary brawler.

How will I push my rico now? Any good showdown maps for him?

Lol got that too

did they drop a new update?

I tried this out too lmao

Ow shit this gave me an idear to beat my own record for most dps again but it’s not possible now I think about it rip

is the update out tho?
---
The math is wrong since you have 10 pulls (mega box) but your point still stands, incredibly lucky

Yeah like an hour ago

Lol

No, the developers have an obligation to make the game fair and fun.

U can try

very exciting

I agree 👍

Na I need frank so I don’t know how I would get both in practice oof

click on the menu button top right (three horizontal bars)

Anyone else have the bug when trying to place pam's turret by tapping the super button it doesn't place and just disappears?
---
The icon for Bo isn't reflecting the remodel
---
its still wrong but you’ll matched with lower trophies but over 9k!!! wth is this -.-“ i don’t like sd because not every brawler can be pushed their and now i have no where to play on
---
Why did they have to nerf Leon? I don’t have him, but I can 1v1 a Leon with primo...
---
Joins the radom teammates club to cuss them...*outstanding move*
---
Oof you bet me
---
Odd place to put it, but thanks
---
There are tons of shotgunners on even skull creek. People just hate those maps
---
what
---
How many gems
---
How you did it? I going to bet you again if you don’t have max brawlers 🌚
---
I mean it's not impossible. 10C3\*99%\^7&amp;1%\^3=1.12\*10\^-4=0.112%. In other words, around the same odds as of getting an actual Legendary brawler (base 0.12% chance, can be higher or lower)
---
*says all the Leon mains who can't play any brawler other than him*
---
He’s overpowered. His starpower speed plus his newly buffed speed is insane
---
Ay ay ay stfu it's not cringe
---
It’s not a bug just with phoenix crow in this particular little mode. And also Use this on heist tower , not as affective but still very good . I have one many Heist because of this .
---
Missing my edgy black/grey name already
---
They need to fix that bug
---
Thanks that was really helpful, there are so many different offers that it’s hard to know which are worth it as a beginner. I will buy the mega box offer and then wait for the next discount on token doublers just as you said, thanks again!
---
Yeah, me too. Only hearing the sounds from my attacks.

its in the replay

Cries in shelly... atleast she got a buff

Umm.. this is a level of stupidity I can’t comprehend. Firstly, you put two sentences side by side without transitional words or phrases. I read into the context like any person with half a brain would do and came to an obvious laid out conclusion. You know this is what you meant so I don’t know why you’re trying to justify your wrong. Secondly, I never said I teamed and I backstabbed. I said I teamed to backstab. That changes the entire intention. If you don’t know what intention in a sentence is then I’ll just stop wasting my time. I can already confirm that you’re not in 7th grade yet because I teach 7th graders and majority of them knew this coming in.
---
Yeah but the record its mine? Cuz i posted this letting 5 alive first :P
---
get that bull boss bot neat mouse bots and super stack you will get around 20k
---
nice video, i like it
---
isnt it supposed to be free?
---
Yup.
---
Shelly needs more of a rework than a buff.
---
Her super is too OP in lower levels when ppl forget to check bushes. With this update, she will absolutely dominate the 0-3k trophy range.
---
Ah thanks!

Will definitely try both :D

2) you backstab

Done. Hope it isn't too hard

Nice!
---
Crow and Bo are so op pls Nerf bo and crow(good job guys )
---
Nice
---
You have a bigger field of view, that line represents the limit. You have a huge advantage.
---
Luckily they got removed
---
So if you ever make a purchase (even by mistake) and refund it, SC can decide rather or not to take anything you used in-game from the Purchase. I accidentally bought a pack and got a refund, awhile went by and I assumed SC was going to be nice and let me keep my stuff, then they just take the gems I spent (Not bad tbh and understandable). 
---
Also thank you very much!
---
#its a bunny
---
How to do in you need to get a Phoenix crow and a crow then go into training camp, charge you super with the 4 bots that spawn around you not the ones at the top, go to the boss and then auto aim the super and one every few tries you will get that big crow
---
The animations are well made.
---
I am not happy with Cavern Churn being removed, it was the map I pushed Rico on.
---
Check the button with the 3 lines top right
---
You are so dumb
---
Read the patch notes again. You can change your name one more time for free if you used the color code before. There's also an option to change your name's color by tapping on your name in your profile in the Trophy Road.
---
Now I only mess around in Training Cave now.
---
I would be part of the crow gang
---
If I had him :'(
---
Yo fix my name.
---
One pam for the price of two
---
Can I put my name yellow again?
---
Congrats all the unnecessary complaining paid off. We’ll see how people feel once they see how op crow will be now.
---
Why do you play Brawl Stars instead of studying and making a future?
---
Feel bad for the other 2 people
---
Okay
---
I actually kinda like it how it is now tbh
---
Sadness noises
---
Stop nerfing my chameleon boi. He's gotten nerfed 5 times now :(
---
No.
---
Do people really like his rework? Because I don’t I like the old version this version looks kinda dumb to me
---
One of the best updates
---
There’s no way that’s a thing. Where did you find it?
---
This shit has to stop, I literally came to check if there were any posts about this.
---
Hopefully with the exposure they are getting now, thanks to the BrawlTV, Supercell address this problem.
---
Sad af
---
Ive also seen a dynamime in siege teaming with the other team, making them lose in ONE round
---
The skin's super has a graphic problem.
---
Yes. Tap on Trophy Road, scroll to your profile, and tap on your name. There is an option to change your name into whatever color you want.
---
Rico needs no skill to work in cavern churn. I hate it.
---
That doesn't answer my question
---
Are you stupid or something
---
I wonder how Spike would sound with a voice...
---
Same as Leon.
---
And Darryl
---
No, that was always in the game.
---
I don't know, but don't buy it for now, wait for them to fix it.

ooh true i should try that

Supercell, there's this bug where I go into Training Cave as a Brawler, let's say El Primo for example. But then when I exit, the game will make voice of the Brawler that I previously had selected when I logged in ( let's say I logged in as Dynamike and I play El Primo in training cave, I exit and then I hear Dynamike say "Here birdie, birdie"). Is this a problem for anyone else. If so, please fix this.
---
Even if they don't fix it now,if I have when they do,it will just uptade
---
they also push you and block shots
---
I used a fucking emoji dumbass
---
Hopefully that's the case.
---
For Spike, what does it mean that you take into account the added range from the projectile splitting? Does that mean it doesn't go as far anymore? His projectile also seems to go slower... or maybe it's just the new effects?
---
You just lost
---
Change it
---
Terrorism
---
i guess you have to change it, unless supercell adresses this issue
---
Did they gave you gems?
---
Okay, thanks!
---
Same is happening with me  whenever i get out of training thingy i listen to bo
---
I already used my 1 tree change
---
I was thinking disturbing the peace for Poco
---
Anyone else not really like the rework tho? Because I personally like the old one better this looks more childish and dumb in my opinion
---
I already used my one free change
---
The new one?
---
Supercell ruined the balance of ratio in the game
---
I agree. That's the big problem of her. Her Super should totally be faster or range longer at least. I would love to use the queen in more than one mode...

Am at 10k, is that enough to qualify as "higher range"? I think Shelly was well off without the buff.

I'm thinking the drinks just come a little closer, to him would be too op.

Can y'all like stop complaining

Oh my god people read the damn patch notes

Oof, that's deep. (Hey, u/Backup41214. It's Deji!)

pretty sure every brawler is a 3d model with perfect edges that dont contain a resolution, if you want finer edges buy a phone with better resolution (or better ppi (pixels per inch) to be correct)

Technically Spike and Gene received a debuff. They lost DPS.
---
It isn't
---
Leon was never suppose to kill tank. He IS an assassin, which mean he's supposed to target low HP target. Because those low HP one have high DMG and high range, this super allow him to close the cap. While with tank, they excel in close range combat with high DPS, Leon should never be able to win against TANKS' MAIN STRENGTH WHICH IS CLOSE RANGE

Hey now with the update my name isn’t pink anymore and has the lettering instead, great work!

Yall are like what, under 5K or something? She struggles a hell lot from 400 above. You can see any of coach cory's, kairos's or lex's videos on gem grab, showdown, brawl ball and they will barely show any Shelly gameplay cuz of her unviability, unless they are doing a ranking video where they put Shelly at the bottom lol

Reality is often disappointing

Like seriously i m sorry  if some random fuker got salty when u say an sonic meme but i was not planed this to be like a shitstorm that makes my day...

Global player. What was life leech?

But a mega box is equivalent to 10 brawl boxes, so you can remove one 0. This is always 0,001% luck...

You can unlock around 100 Leon with that luck lol

So contact them from supercell.com, sorry bro 😔

Agree, I read a little the balance changes notes, and they mention Frank, reducing the duration if his stun to the boss, but they didn't mention Penny's cannon.
---
No prob is my fault .. I accidentally log in that banned account..

Brock is good in showdown on most maps and decent to good in almost all gem grab maps. His super is one of the best in the game providing both control and clearing the path to make him more effective.

I read the best use for gems are buying tickets first, and second buying the token doublers. I'm not sure about this one.

Omg it worked!
---
Couldn't have said it better
---
They have dine stuff about teaming. In the meteor game mode meteors will target teams. In the healing mushroom one mushrooms will stay away from groups of players
---
it happens on other brawlers as well. it doesn't harm the game or anything really. but im pretty sure they will fix this soon enough.

Next to the "select" button in the brawler’s screen

Instagram? Go look memes from there maybe you find tge sonic meme

Yea F
---
"I am against this"

"I must do this though because I'm not good enough to progress any other way"

Someone else noticed that the game is more lagged now or is just me?

Bot Drop is the only long range Siege map so yeah

Life leech wasn't horrible for me, I got 5 brawlers to rank 20 just in life leech.

Exactly. There is really no way for supercell to fix this that I can think of.
---
Instagram normie
---
What the actual fuck did I Just see?!
---
We can agree to disagree
---
I tried, after the 1st super its not really good...
---
There’s a hell of a lot of controversy just from what I said there.
---
I think my point is being misunderstood.
---
I don’t hate life leech (well I kinda did, but whatever, I hate heist). What I actually hated, was how it removed the core mechanic of the game - life - and replaced it with ever degrading health. I’m a 3v3 player, and in my eyes life leech wasn’t Brawl Stars to me, I would reluctantly play DSD/SSD, but when it came to life leech, to me it wasn’t *there*. 
---
It didn’t feel like the game I was playing - and I think Supercell saw that life leech felt like an entirely different game.
---
This point is completely different, as yes I understand some people enjoyed it (especially Reddit-based players) and it was effective to push in, I just don’t feel as if it had a true place in Brawl Stars, that’s all.
---
Why the fuck
---
Have they

OMG 😍 thanks 🙏🏼 its work 👍🏼

Ur welcom
---
OK, I understand your point, but I still play very passively in life leech especially if I'm using piper, I always play it so that I won't get hit by other brawlers while sniping them.
---
Thank you a lot 😭 it's always a honor!
---
Don't worry bro
---
Maybe you hear the sound of the brawler that you selected before?
---
People who play crow like this were the ones asking for a buff lol.
---
You get a free name change... go to name change option to claim it
---
Crow's poison damage is proportional to dagger damage (1/4 dagger per tick)
---
Look at the size of the crow at super
---
Reminds me of the good ol' days of 1941
---
You can also select the color now... its part of the update
---
I laughed so hard
---
Still waiting for that dynamike nerf
---
Yeah after I posted this, that what I noticed too each time I clicked "Play Again". After exiting and start a new game, the problem doesn't happen.

Leave teaming it ads a twist to showdown

She would throw two yellow cards on the side and the one in the middle would be red
---
I mean it makes sense when you consider it’s for his super
---
That was when the game was first revealed
---
must have
---
True but it could have been new brawler. It’s like winning the lottery and instead of getting money you get dirt
---
Damn..im the only one who like this map?lol

But it was the map I reach my crow to rank 20 :')
---
Lmao See you in hot

Lil helper Penny was in the game since Christmas and they changed the attack just now...
---
yeah that's a good strategy man. but in term of gaming experience I do enjoy Siege because we can kill the other teammates whatever we want. Brawl Stars should add a map like a Deathmatch map. I mean sometimes, I get bored when I lose gem grab like 5-6 times in a row same with brawl ball.
---
Shelly counters Darryl, Mortis, El Primo, many times Bull and Frank. I really don’t like how everyone and their dad abuses her in showdown. She torments tf out of lower trophies and the buff will make it worse
---
https://i.redd.it/2ouuj037ejr21.png
---
Yeah just realized that
---
You can just change it.
---
Welp down goes the luck again lol...
---
Only if you pay attention 🤗
---
Glad you liked it :)
---
Well your crow is already at rank 20 so why should you still play that map?
---
only if you are lucky enough to pull one

Nice to see you liked it :D

I hope they introduce a whole theme of soccer skins when the World Cup comes or another big soccer event. Hey when summer arrives, can you do a whole collection of summer themed skins? That would be cool

Carl buff is very noticable in game

Nice copy of my post kid
---
I know, but why do I have to use my free name change again because I already had my color that is since the update that the name is shown different and I do not want to use free change because I might need it later
---
Is she out?
---
Ok, thanks for the tip. Now I can improve my maps! 🥰
---
Not trying to sound like a dick, but this is pretty useless and just spoon feeding players. Like we already know how these brawlers work and newer players are bound to find out in less then two games
---
All good just thought I'd let you know. Have a good one
---
&gt; It's called **fan art** for a reason. You do it **expecting no compensation** or even recognition, just because you enjoy the game.

Yes it can be job but community makes maps because they love the game!

You’re not being misunderstood. You’re a coward who wants to play passively and let the other kill each other before doing anything. Granted, that’s a viable strategy. But don’t come crying when a mode isn’t perfectly suited for you.

He broke the standards, rather than jumping into the team, he jumped away, truly a pro player

Yeah i was afraid too

Black/gray was difficult to read on some surfaces, so they removed support for it

Great idea! I'm also imagining how she's going to be throwing referee cards, orange and red, which is going to look so good. The artwork is so nice looking as well, I love it!

Best map in the game RIP
---
His range was like twice of what it is now
---
R.I.P 😂
---
hey so literally like two days ago I disagreed with you when you said Crow was cancerous in Showdown.
---
Welp, now that the update is here.... I take it back. I finally don't have to tiptoe around the map when using him which is SUPER nice, but he also feels a tad OP. Him being my best brawler around 520 trophies, he was my favorite but I also had to play crazyyyy carefully because of his weak initial damage and low HP. Now, he feels a bit OP. Nothing like Leon was, but they could half Crow's buff and he'd probably be in a better place.
---
I jumped into it with dyna star power before 😂

Thank u so much !

I think if she will be on sale she will cost 19 gems like other rares but if not then 30

I def agree

80 gems for bunny penny (comming in 19th of April) and 150 gems for shiba nita (comming in during golden week wich is from the21rst of April to the 28th)

If you come up with a better solution than this you should be the supercell president.

Shiba nita will be permanent and penny comes this friday price is unknown

You have one for free

He justs need a polish.

---
Turns me on ...
---
Heh heh heh heh!
---
No it’s the best part of the update, cracks me up
---
Didn’t work
---
I'm ready to serve.
---
Cool photoshop
---
Hey guyth
---
FTFY
---
Yeah, but watch Supercell fuck him up harder than No-Hat Mortis
---
Yes I agree with you  We won +6 trophies and 2nd match we lost it because this lagging doesn't want us to win.This is harder than teaming
---
You're right, I'll just be over here scared.
---
When you will have rosa, you'll be happy to play her in snake prairie
---
I didn't say that it's bad, just that it's correct.
---
Press the try butoon and then press on the right to switch to skin and release "try butoon" midway
---
You swipe to the side with Bunny Penny and hit try at the same time. Worked first try multiple times for me!
---
Just get Twitter. Write opinions about updates, ideas and game in overall. Developers must see that, you are very interested in the game.
---
And you don't want to be mean to the kid, so you be nice in the limited conversations you have which makes him think you're his friend even more even though you just want him to go away but you don't want to say that to his face.
---
I do?  We're getting married now?
---
Star powers are easier to get then legendaries
---
I’m at the royal ghost emote :)
---
Thats a new form of teaming that is taking over and its actually ruining showdown completely.
---
People who are active and fight are punished for doing so. People who hide in a bush are not only safer from enemy fire but also are more likely to be teamed with and not against.
---
Started seeing it at 500. People just standing there until the gas kills us all, or one person attacks. Wtf.
---
Its fair
---
No problem!
---
You posted the same thing twice
---
Poco buff r/PocoGang
---
Only thing I like about the remodel is the cheat. The colours do not go together and the eagle makes him look stupid.
---
I made a referee Tara before but it gedi kor’s is way better
---
I have high rare rate so im good
---
Omg don’t upvote because supercell will find out
---
So?
---
I made this exact same post yet yours got way more upvotes OOF. Have my upvote anyway because you noticed too.
---
the good thing is that we can expose them
---
Yea u play too much
---
What, that's illegal!
---
great editing
---
Hey at least Leon deals the same damage. I usually don't get to charge my super because I'm too busy running away from people
---
Wdym?
---
suits him very well
---
It fucking sucks, I AM LAGGING ALL THE FUCKING TIME. How is this the same supercell company as coc and royale?
---
It’s like shitcell took over. Nonclan requests for xp or gold, no wars, NOTHING. Just lag after lag
---
Context?
---
Now I can change my name color! Before it was 1 character too long
---
I agree. The only problem is that Brawl Stars' fanbase is mostly ten-year-olds.
---
What I hate most is the fact that his hat has tee back of a cap
---
His animations look dope tho
---
Mann Vs. Machine
---
Yessssss
---
Presumably in two weeks.
---
Not sure who found the bug but I saw it on reddit and I might as well make a how to video :-) (not very good had a few minutes to edit! Hope you enjoyed!)
---
OOOOOOF too long
---
Missed opportunity to make the cannonballs Easter eggs
---
dank
---
Салам алейкум
---
Spike :)
---
XD
---
I spectated a friendly game so...
---
Just two people duo show downing with a bunch of boys
---
you guys are great, truly the best support and fixed that problem before I even thought about it.
---
Agree
---
But I have the Free Nick change so these are two different topics in my opinion, I refunded for a legitimate reason and I had money to spend on the game. Since I love the game I'll spend money if I can.
---
IT IS CROWS HEAD!!!!!
---
Why is Spike eating the heads of their enemies.
---
Works! Thanks
---
nah just a buff
---
Nvm
---
Bug found by u/ZoroCloud
---
I’m not that bad at the game btw, I’m just using a different account so my main doesn’t get banned for showing glitches to the public. Supercell please don’t ban just try to fix this :)
---
Exactly
---
Did penny get a range buff? That doesnt look like 9 tiles
---
Good idea
---
Holy Crap. 3 punches and she gets her super back? This is actually a 12 second invincibility shield.
---
She’s op
---
It's just a sort of sensory overload.
---
Everybody gangsta until a random robot starts saying "AAAAEHHHHAOUFHAHAGAHAU" outta no where
---

---
#TOP PLAYERS
---
i know i was just saying that a lot of people will disagree with you
---
Secret
---
Tell me plzzz
---
If only they change Darryl's badic attack from 2 shots into one..
---
Playing rocket league RN, dm me
---
I feel it would make the skin like super cool
---
just hold try and let go after you swipe to bunny penny
---
Should have gotten a iPhone 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Degenerates like you belong on the cross
---
Bruh that’s already out
---
Poco will rise again
---
Ooooo nice

---
37490 DPS with a power 4 tara lol
---
Kara, Darryl, and Leon don't say a single word in the game
---
Poco as a better healer but pam as a better combatant maybe? Pam probably needs a small range nerf but still.
---
hide in the bushes or get sucked into the vortex of doom
---
serenade poco
---
Lmao iPhones are better 📱
---
no im best
---
They just give in this update... Carl a voice. Meanwhile Tara or Leon didn't even get anything new.
---
You switch by pressing the arrow and with another finger press try while its switching
---
*silence*
---
What? Please explain I've never hear of this.
---
Tara, Darryl, and Leon don’t have voices despite having been in the game for a while but Carl just got a voice even though he was just released
---
Same for me
---
This is not my screenshot lol, screenshot is from Lex’s update video on YouTube.
---
Oof. And that was the battle that could’ve gotten you to 500 with Nita
---
Oh ok thanks lmao I never play this sound that’s why I didn’t get it at first
---
Snake Prairie.
---
U gotta give props to the poco, he ran up with him to enemy spawn to heal and support... primo would’ve been long dead if not for the poco
---
0.1 seconds actually affects it a lot and in certain situations can be the difference between a win and a loss. shelly got a range buff and projectile speed buff, but when did she ever get a reload speed buff?
---
also, a decrease in reload speed makes it faster and better if you did not realise
---
Thats a gud idea bcs rn...brawl tv just puts you in a random place xD
---
Or its just me... 😂
---
After crow buff, we need darryl's super buff. Darryl's super without star power is useless (except for brawl ball). And, can you make Darryl's super recharge faster?
---
The exception is when playing with randoms.
---
You might wonder why but the answer is quite simple. Money. See, that Poco has the star power already, but the dude has only 3k trophies.
---
So yea, he doesnt get banned cuz he spent money, and if he gets banned he might not wanna spend more money in the future.
---
Well the skin isn’t out yet which probably means they are working on it still (though it is useable in training) so it might happen
---
