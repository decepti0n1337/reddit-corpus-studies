Just like my dad

He is pretty shit in gem grab too. Every time he is on my team, he barely contributes anything and just dies all the time

I‚Äôm studying pure math in one of the top Universities. Don‚Äôt try to make excuses, you can learn everything by yourself. Find proper books, tutorial videos and be consistent if you really want it.

If you can‚Äôt learn it, than you don‚Äôt want it strong enough, but definitely not because you can‚Äôt. 99% of people born with equal mind abilities, the only thing that matters in this f**ing life is your self control and determination.

nita is supposed to be an aggressive brawler to put constant pressure on the enemy team with her attack and bear
---
I'll try to once I get my upvotes

Cactus?

nita and penny are too young for this roo, aren't they?
---
I have 3 mythic but 1 super rare is darrel
---
U put Jess in the wrong tier. I think she will fix it
---
#EEEELLLL PRRRRIIIIMMMMOOOOO
---
Actually, Nita is one of the best, her super fast reload speed makes up for the low damage, the bear is great for pushing back low dps brawlers like poco. She is probably the best at peak-shotting, and she can attack through walls, not to mention the incredible skins she has. I can see why you would think that, but she‚Äôs actually pretty good.

Oh.. I‚Äôm global

What is this?

I hope he realized who killed him
---
Wowwwwwwwww
---
Leon got nerfed 4 times though.
---
1. nerf: Added the 4-tile visibility when next to a brawler.
---
2. nerf: Super duration down to 8 seconds, damage down to 460.
---
3. nerf: Damage down to 460, super charge time +1 shruiken.
---
4. nerf: Super invisibility time down to 7 seconds.
---
What did I just read
---
Retardation is a very common mental illness, of course people would play like thos.
---
What the f?! like 90% global players have more trophies than me, even though im from beta..god im sad now, i have all the brawlers except Leon and Crow, F2P...\*sadness noise\*

You're  legend

No

So yeah. There is worse

No kidding. Its boring.....

Reminds me of YOLO

Is that a reference of that Mettaton EX vs Frisk Fan Art?

Lore wise, Rosa + Spike are more important, gameplay wise, Morty + Dyna are more important.

That is actually amazing, they were so dumb!

Glad supercell made a way to win against teamers like that.

he actually needs to be like when he was released, make a legendary feels like a legendary, most like a rare brawler looks like a legendary

Him and Anita are...why do u think they are related to animals

Missing El Primo

Cool idea!
---
Simple solutions keep a brawler low on purpose when you win lose the trophies and repeat that way you can play seige safely
---
Yikes you sound like me talking to my little brother. Welp, not everything is cut and dry, there are circumstances that can arise from a 1- 0 score with 15 seconds left, or a mirrored triple tank match, etc etc
---
Dang bro

Can someone check if being displaced while holding the ball shoots it at the direction you were last facing?

They better make this a thing.

no, shelly can destroy a 20 power cube bull
---
A team based adventure mode would put this game over the edge. I know it's not that type of game, but I think it could be a way to earn PP, coin, or gem. Maybe even exclusive skins for completing super hard puzzles/maps
---
Im att 4 500 and i have one legendary brawler.leon
---
This is skill
---
Sorry. Numbers 1 and 2 are different options for the super. The normal attack would just be throwing a spear straight forward like a shot. My bad.
---
Couldn't find a better format tho
---
dick
---
Thank you,
---
so each game mode has different criteria to be a star player? Like in heist it will be the amount of damage dealt to the safe?
---
Brock can be played as a long range, like piper, but also a short range almost shotgunner due to his high burst damage. I‚Äôd recommend starting off playing the long range game, targeting mostly squishy targets (spike, penny, Jessie, piper, anybody who isn‚Äôt a tank) and using bushes to ambush brawlers who are damaged or have a low health pool. Brock is mostly about positioning and aim/predicting where the enemy will go/be. The more practice you have with him the better, but I think the best advice I can give you is target squishes, you can get picks incredibly easily when you hit your shots and allow your team to control middle, while in bounty you‚Äôre earning stars off each easy kill.
---
Better than randoms tho üòÇüòÇ
---
This is the first Spike skin concept that isn't made by GEDI-KOR that I actually like

Wonderful !

I love this skin and I'd love it when the next skin is Frank :)
---
barley lol
---
Yup. In Brawl Ball it is unique since we obviously cannot determine who goals how many times (esp. if the enemy throws) so it should be based on the kill-death ratio or damage dealt per second. Same in gem grab - you aren't the star player by being the gem carrier sometimes.

I got Rico as my profile pic in-game and he's not even my favorite, and I rarely use him.

It's 'cause he's one handsome boi
---
So I live in America, so the most important language for me to learn is English.
---
My mom (and my dad) grew up in India, so they learned the national language (Hindi, which they are speaking here), and Telugu (which is my mothertongue). My parents speak to each other in Telugu, so I can understand that language pretty well (although I have difficulty understanding it).
---
My mom's friend also grew up in India, but in a different state, so she does not understand Telugu. So they communicate in English and Hindi, and in this case they were speaking in Hindi.
---
Dude his damage per full attack was nerfed by 240,60 less on each blade his super duration was nerfed by 3 seconds you can now see him within 4 tiles and his charge rate of the super was nerfed too.Plust that he has the 3rd lowest health in the game,just learn how to deal with him
---
Why you took a week?
---
no i download from the link in yt
---
You still reposted it
---
If you have talent you can destroy any team in seconds. This doesn't mean rosa is op. Only brawler who needs to be nerfed is spike. At least he needs a balance update or rework or something like that. E.g they can reduce the damage but increase the health
---
You don‚Äôt have to be standing still to be hit by it, a lot of times you need to turn around or change direction and that‚Äôs when the hit lands.
---
So in these two game modes it will be the aggregate of multiple criteria, so in that case won't the kill/death ratio be more apt for a game mode like bounty rather than just kills
---
You never fail to amaze me
---
I do not put Mortis Gang posts and J never went in that Gang, but thx anyways and have a "legendary" year!

It already started. Many players switching on other games because of this latest Rosa crap...  But they just ignore it for who knows what reason. They know everything. They know statistics from their servers, they know if one team has Rosa and other dont what is a win/lose chance, etc, etc...

Exactly, you can't play as Rosa, Leon, Mortis, have a lot of power cubes, be cornered,  etc without people teaming on you. They just instantly see you as a big target or easy prey.
---
umm well, when they were printed they were just grey, cuz the PLA that was used for printing was grey. Then I just used spray paints and acrylic paints to color them the correct colors :)
---
Do you draw it?
---
I like how You did this without using some  expensive pencils. Realul apreciate this fan-art.
---
I'm at 2.6k without an epic
---
Cuz u got that
---
Being at 5k without a legendary is not a big deal lol, it's completely normal dude...
---
Spending 19 gem cause discount
---
How do people make these skins! They are so good do you draw it with a painting app?
---
I looks like there was anti teaming within the opposition team. 
---
üòÖ
---
This is true but not the only factor. Total damage dealt is also a big factor in deciding star player and (obviously) winning the match makes you much more likely to get star player (but not certain)
---
u/armenhart u/Mexican_Potato69 thoughts?
---
Get used to it
---
nope :) it's just the angle. do you wish he was buff? XD
---
It also appears it was taken off the playstore as ads dont play no more( which is great with no ads) . i was checking if there any updates so if it came with new icons or something like that for better map making, but no? It doesnt even appear as installed in playstore... What happened ?
---
They loved it hahha
---
I live skin but shes trash and weak
---
Maybe
---
It would be my dream, even if only they really took my skins into considerationüî•
---
Lelell

As usual another great idea by gedi sir I would love to sign a petition for his appointment at supercell BS .
---
Whoever wants upvote the post plz !!
---
Same just like her pose i find the bear ugly but Shiva nita looks adorable if she didnt have white eyes she reminds me of Robin from teen titans go
---
Well played, that's pretty cool beating them 53-0 but tbh they were literally running in and feeding you stars the whole time tho lol
---
yeah he's good for protecting the ball at the start of the game by throwing bottles at it so no one can come close :D
---
honestly, any brawler can be good. it just depends on the user skills ;)
---
 Hello. I'm a representative of Max Basharin channel ([https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=6i-vUKTPg\_s&amp;t=62s](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=6i-vUKTPg_s&amp;t=62s)).  I found your clip and I really like it! :) Can I use this clip for our  future videos? I will credit you for sure!Ôªø Have a nice day! Kind  regards Max.
---
Wow, our leader is here (r/shellygang)
---
indeed
---
Brawler concept to follow.....
---
All I can say is he us a bit fishy
---
Yes, I create them
---
Shellys guns is hollow confirmed
---
Wow could you like teach me?
---
Everything ok but... what happend to Colts hair?
---
Why didn't you put a single skin , all brawlers are default , why? I am sure u got few skins
---
Wait man are you a brock?
---
When I draw stuff it takes me like a week to make something like this... How long does it take you?
---
hahaha maybe you could make a "new skin" idea for that uwu
---
How long does it take! For me it take a week to draw something as good as this.
---
Ayyy, got a question, do ads not show up in the app anymore?
---
They surely must raging after that
---
They thought it was the best!
---
I gave the b-day boi to choose, he chose Spike, and his bro loved Sakura just the same, so it went great.
---
They were like "can u print other characters for next birthday" hhaha if they only knew the process it took to just make the Spike xD
---
Shelly is a yandere confirmed
---
Rico‚Äôs head fell in the match
---
sorry I will
---
there was
---
spike and gene ones are just quality ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
Exactly the same idea still counts as same idea
---
This is a super cool idea!! Supercell better add this, I need it in my life!!!!!
---
Murder is legal when you see this.
---
&gt; I'm sorry, I'm just not English and the translation may not be correct.
---
This is so cool! üòé
---
We'll seeüî•
---
Yeah fair enough
---
My *FAVOURITE* map
---
with sharpness 1000
---
Fun fact: way back when the game was beta,Mortis got nerfed 4 times in a row:
---
 -dash range decrease by 25% 
---
-heath decrease by 12.5%
---
-speed decrease to run same speed as everyone else beside crow ,super range decrease.
---
-star power nerf.
---
would be cool if colt pulls out a gattling gun or something for his super
---
Take notes u/GEDI-KOR
---
I think im gonna repost this in 5:00 PM.
---
Because for some reason this inst getting attention,like this received 3 upvotes In 1:00 PM and its still 3 upvotes,wich that means this is not getting attention at all.Just an advice if you want to upvote this again.
---
cause he was more op than leon.
---
math ERROR. O divided by zero is not possible
---
Lets hope
---
I LOVE THIS HHH
---
Pretty cool
---
It was a joke.. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
That was amazing üòÇüòÇ
---
Yes he is. Look at any tier lists. Spike has decent range.
---
Oof
---
Did someone forgot about "royal agent Colt"?
---
Yeah
---
I also think it‚Äôs super unfair that the Nita has no ammo. Actually, if you have a powercube advantage I also think you should give all your cubes to other players!!!!!!
---
Also supers are super unfair and should also be removed !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
/s
---
#NO ONE GIVES A SHIT
---
Only when you do a match with that specific brawler
---
Typically do not resonate with skin ideas, but this was an exception. Well done
---
op must dislike weekend events a lot
---
yes you are. first of all, you named me karma farmer, and i maybe that's offensive for me, 2nd, instead of doing a bit of analyzing that people actually like these you wrote comment "stop doing these" like it's going to change anything. prove me wrong
---
I feel like that was a hint
---
don‚Äôt forget to downvote!
---
Need Cereal Darryl nowüòÇ
---
You can keep it
---
I dropped it for a reason
---
Im 5k with 2 legendaries...
---
Im at 7.9k and got 400 hours so that sounds right.
---
I‚Äôm confused, what is that thing
---
That should be a skin
---
It‚Äôs because they usually have bad WiFi and most Mexicans don‚Äôt play videos games
---
This is all headcanon
---
Exactly And Crow Does Nlt Have Alot Of Health
---
How long have you been playing?
---
What power level is ur crow
---
I know people like them. Anyways, anybody could make these. Not hard to make at all. Low effort memes like these that are being reposted over and over and over again is described as karma farming. I‚Äôm not simply targeting at you, I‚Äôm simply wishing for better and more creative memes on this subreddit instead of the same creativity of the Kirby franchise on here.
---
Not sure if you read the box on the side but bo could be possibly much older anyways. I just decided to put it much lower.
---
Ahahha I imagine:(
---

---
K time to retire good job
---
Ok,that will help to get the Star Powers as times goes on, but what is there in late game incentive? If I have all the stars in 3 months, and then I get tons of coins I have nothing to spend them on. 
---
I suppose when new brawlers are released I can max in a day, but that is unbalanced to other players. Same old Supercell short sight.
---
i could just literally spam entire subreddit with lots of these, but i don't. i only post ones that i like or find funny. is that bad?
---

Shelly takes two rosas down faster than one
---
Sorry I'm a disappointment in life
---
Thanks!
---
Thank you!
---
What I just said was the example of ‚Äúgitting gud‚Äù
---
That‚Äôs what happens when you ‚Äúgit gud‚Äù
---
yes you are right, it was coincidence. We worked on same concept. But I didn't steal anything.

Yes.

She definitely needs another nerf. Anyone who says otherwise we won‚Äôt talk about

'' Habablala HABABHHABABA '' He says, with a grin on his face, before leaving with them
---
YOU AGAIN?!?
---
It's beautiful
---
got‚Äòcha now it‚Äôs a feature

I swear I didn't   Repost.   Maybe some one thought of it before me
---
True, hopefully they'll do more about it.

OK

Which means I'll never get (jk I have all legendary)

Nerf Rosa!

You tryna put ya boi on with some Mortis trophy pushing tips?

AHAHHAHAHAHAHA
---
That Tara probably should've used their super, but I guess it wouldn't make a big difference if the timing was off
---
Do you realize that you literally can‚Äôt get into the center with those jump pads
---
Dynamike and bo were available in normal boxes before global release, then they made them trophy road exclusive
---
My favorite modes are heist and Solo
---
My list 
---
1. Heist

2. Solo sd
---
3. Bounty
---
4. Gem grab
---
5. Duo sd

6. Siege (love it but the trophy loss is too harsh)
---
7. Brawl ball

He's actually pretty good at gem grab, especially if there's no healer on the other team

I'm in love with your art style! If you do a Mortis one I will absolutely give something!

Why is that dude worth of being a meme template?

But i was broke so i couldn't buy for 30

The feeling you get when ol' Mike kills a creature of the night...
---
How many trophies do you have with him?
---
Practice makes perfect
---
But it does hit corners/s
---
how?
---
Yep
---
Well he is supposed to be a support brawler so I guess playing as him wouldn't be as much fun as the others
---
i'll spare you this one time
---
Yeah, sorry
---
I'm still wondering how does people have similar names
---
Not that far...

im.. a WHAT?!

I'm twelve, I can hardly draw a cat
