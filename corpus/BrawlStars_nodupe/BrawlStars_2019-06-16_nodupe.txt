I skipped over all of that, I read like..the first 3 sentences XD.

---
1) IM NOT TRIGGERED THIS IS HOW I DEBATE, shit didnt even know I had caps on not gonna delete it though, that's too much work XD.
---
2) Some of them may be alts but not my friend XD hes at 2.5k(lenny) and my other friend is at 11k(trevis), me and lenny win against trevis quite alot(not together of course I'm talking 1 v 1)
---
I have about 30 "friends" who are at 8k+ and I guarantee that half if not more of them cant beat lenny. Because we had a tourney. 
---
3) you say I haven't seen your gameplay but u also haven't seen mine.
---
I dont have discord but u can give your team code and I'll join

---
They are nothing compared to the sniper bot who can shoot behind walls
---
I do I'm just playing with randoms but like I say my brawlers probably aren't powered up enough and I'm relatively new so I wouldn't want to bring you down man! That level must be crazy difficult. Are the rewards even worth it? Tbh I don't see the point in this game mode if it's so impossible and you don't get rewards along the way.
---
I miss this
---
I said the post suffers. She deserved that buff, she also deserved another buff. If you have 15 PC or you use the energy drink good you deserve to win. In this picture it kinda looks like that only Shelly has accese to those powers if you know what I mean. Powercubes and energy drink doesn't make her OP. Everyone can pick them up. You say that she is only  good in SD and she sucks everywhere else. Why would you complain about a buff she got then? Everyone has problems against that one brawler. I get this but this post does a shitty job to reflect your own opinion.
---
I dont think we will ever see, but maybe if a skin comes that shows his face, we can see. I think leon is cool now, with his hoodie :3
---
Just to be kill by teaming shellys

For me to replay any levels below Insane IV doesn‚Äôt cost any tickets, so it doesn‚Äôt affect me in any way haha. Ill be down to help you just send me your team code.

Make a new one.
---
Pam, Bull and Colt
---
At the start of the round deal all the amount of damage possible, dont take time to regen hp just keep attacking.
---
Let the Bull take all the power cubes
---
The Colt must have to stay away from boss n teammates so the missile attack will track him and he must get take of all the mini robots(he can also deal damage from range so he can help in the first minute)
---
In later game the laser attack can be really frustating, the Bull must have to be close to the boss since is more easy to dodge the laser attack(only use super to escape)
---
If you dont have super and you are about to die the Pam must sacrifice.
---
I just watched this video earlier today
---
So you say that this doesn‚Äôt happen when Pam/Bo/Poco/Frank/Mortis(!)/Primo see eachother?! OMFG, there is one map where throwers team, those 6 always team on every map.

ÁôæÂßì and Yamada(might you know him...)said that Rico Mortis Shelly are OP.
---
So I wondered why they got buff.
---
I made it to insane 5 with randoms, maybe we could join?
---
What a smart play. That‚Äôll teach teamers.
---
Same I tried it in friendly game because I don't have it and it didnt work

Sad ursaring isn‚Äôt there

It's not a solo victory or a 3v3 victory, but you gain trophies

ah, gotcha :D

I'm at 4k with no legendaries
---
Yes, you can. Thank you for giving credit.
---
Hmm... I didn‚Äôt think of that
---
I see this as an absolute LOSS!
---
I also think the same however there isn't a way to validate someone as a thrower unless there will.be someone who watches the replay or gameplay itself. As there is thousands of games with similar problems, I doubt Supercell will do anything about it. Having a report system will have a chance to backfire as some could team up and report against a person who did not do anything whatsoever.
---
I was about to draw, then I realized that there are people who say 
---
'COLT IS PAM'S SON! SHE IS NOT SUPPOSED TO FLIRT WITH HER OWN SON'
---
And in my 'mother's day' special art, I made penny like a teen, and some guy said 'she is a 30 year old dwarf' ... So...
---
But still, I am more disappointed by the fact that I can't post it normally, otherwise some old men will get angry, telling me this is a 'child friendly' game. And I am like :
---
THEN WHY THE HELL ARE YOU HERE  YOU OLD FREAK!

Typical complaining post about quitting because of not getting a legendary.
---
Maybe she think she‚Äôs a Shelly?
---
So little timmy that has 10k trophies in his 100$ phone gets throw out of the game due to over heating his phone, he should be punished. Gtfo with this stupid AFK punishment. Shit is not Ranked CS:GO.
---
Dynamike is about to find out just how many hits from a shovel his hard hat can take
---
They‚Äôve evolved
---
I‚Äôm not really complaining about the legendary they aren‚Äôt the best characters right now i just haven‚Äôt gotten anything new in a while I‚Äôm missing like 5-6 brawlers. I haven‚Äôt gotten good random teammates and the event modifiers don‚Äôt really make me want to do showdown. So I‚Äôm stuck in a limbo
---
his mechanic feel more like a trophy road
---
Wintrading. Top players will abuse this to push one account. This would make you able to 'never' lose trophies on one account by sacrificing trophies on another.
---
Yes, joke, lol. They are VERY different cultures.
---
Perfect timing

Do you have star Shelly skin if you do then yeah you have waited a long tinr

Yep

You're talking about a rare situation. It's not an excuse to throw the game, most of the time they have no excuse whatsoever. In real life, you cannot balance two things at once. If you got other priorities, then fix them first because it's unfair for others to suffer to no fault of their own.

Like I said, whether or not the player willingly left the game should be punished for leaving either way. The teammates would have to shoulder what "Timmy" left. Every gamemode except Solo Showdown would need teammates and Of course, teammates are a valuable asset or if not we would lose the game. And as you may already know, this kind of AFK system is already present in many popular games.
---
Literally what happened to my Rico
---
Doesn't help that the Boss gets faster and faster the more autistic he gets
---
I thought of that too, but I should have said that this would only be applicable to random games and not pre-made games.
---
It really is! He did the final 4000 damage for us
---
Without looking it up, in fairly certain that amount of down votes was record setting and was for EA saying that the ridiculously long leveling system to unlock all of the content in the new star wars game was "To give the player a sense of accomplishment " or something. The community was extremely unfond of that.

Flair should be ‚Äúart‚Äù

Thats why they released Maple Barley. Frank said they will celebrate Brawl Stars' birthday on 12th of December when the game went global, so I dont think we will see any birthday update, sadly
---
the boss drops power cubes when you deal damage to him
---
wow... if wolf was implemented into the game he would be broken
---
They will put discounts for skins
---
oh. ok lol
---
Good job!
---
The only ticket event game I play is big game because being the big brawler means I don‚Äôt have to rely on idiots.
---
Is it even possible?
---
That one random who plays Frank in boss fight
---
This is absolutely amazing! I love it! I‚Äôd give more praise but I‚Äôd sound like a broken record XD
---
Yeah, it does so its not all bad.
---
Your teammates were likely on a team.

I noticed you put the official surname of Bull of him old description xD (sorry for my bad English)

Let me join in too. This monstrosity should not be revealed to the world.

lmao i had that like on my first day playing

Every mortis ever

yeah im trying to save this subreddit from your shit posts
---
Shellys are so desperate they started to team between them
---
Boss fight respawn is way damn longer than 20 seconds. I stg the timer is slow or something, it is not 20 seconds.
---
Colt, Pam, Bull is definitely the best comp
---
I had it everyday that I‚Äôm home alone.
---
I do play heist, but lost more than 20 cups cuz of bad randoms
---
Yea, bull is pretty good
---
Sure!
---
The only brawlers that are good on the mode are Pam, Colt and Bull

Teamers are backstabbers anyway. You're just as bad.

I don't know why but i really like the draw theme

Nice artwork amigo

Muerte a la grasa

Excuse me but if a mine started to glow it explodes even if new mines are already spawned (in this case only an arrow was released). I clearly remember paying special attention for that moment when I was learning to play Bo. May have changed though, gonna test.

I had 2018 trophies last year and say someone with 2019, wish I had uploaded it now

So wholesome im crying. That drawing at the end

You obviously don't get it. How old are you? The Mona Lisa is very famous, so obviously people would know u ain't the creator as the creator is dead. This art is not famous. You don't go to a museum and expect to see BiBi art, do you?

They are the ones hiding in a bush the entire time while your team gets destroyed.

And when do they come out to actually fight? When your team is dead. Then they die and we repeat.

El rey wasn't added when the game was released. It came out in a random update with beach brock. Saw havoc's video on the history of bs and is refreshed my memory

Probably bull or shelly lol

Your too strong for a Nerf anyway

I stan to this

This funny crap made me laugh. lol

thx

Thank you! Damn shellys and brocks(???) taking power cubes. How did these people even get to insane?

I absolutely love your drawings of these younger brawlers, they're so adorable!

thank you as always, Llewho!

Well i actually dropped to 422 and i cant get back, i got to 485 tho

thank you so much! I actually hope to make one for each brawler &lt;3

Oh sh-

He sadly deleted it tho
---
Hell yeah
---
This made me wheeze in laughter. Thank you.

Lie or not, supercell still needs to make money to feed their kids. They said they‚Äôd fix this special offer thing next client update so guess we‚Äôll have to wait and see
---
Oh sure that NOT!
---
Shit Shelly players grabbing power cubes are my biggest issue lol
---
Chilli?
---
That was awesome!
---
This has nothing to do with mm lol
---
Love G-string Bo

Lol well done, but it was super easy difficulty with maxed pam, plus team mates killing the small robots
---
The old model of rico , dynamike were much better. Now we have a fat boi , a normal old man with a yellow bird (still alive).
---
Don't sure
---
Why does this remind me of The Outsiders
---
By S. E. Hinton for you genies
---
What if we saw Leon as a kid holding baby Nita, sorry i ship those two as siblings owo
---
Yeah, legendaries are better regardless of anything else. If you get a legendary your immediately a pro.

Roooofffffflllllllll im sticking with that too

what a heart warming comic

I think this qualifies as a Honestly though meme

---
I'd read/watch that.
---
WHAT ABOUT THAT 100K HEATH BOT AT TRAINING CAVE?
---
Brock was absolutely the best
---
Not at all. Dyna is really hard to hit with, and his Star Power is really hard to utilise properly. Mortis is also really hard, but Dyna is harder
---
I just realized that you write the name "Jessie" and not "Jessy". Lol

Why is Leon so mean :( Spike finally managed to get a balloon and not pop it and then this happens.

I don‚Äôt think so

Not requested by other r/assassingang members, it was me and just me :p.
---
Careful, this guy‚Äôs a hero
---
I drew a rapper penny
---
How about brock? Look at this weird boi he was much better back then
---
*acts like I read this*
---
He should've played showdown and camp until 5th, the more safer choice than going into a 3v3 mode or siege
---
I will *bace* myself
---
The pheonix skin from Crow costs 300 gems. That would be legendary.
---
I do it when I'm tilting, but other than that I'm usually aggressive, which can work at times
---
He was just panicked I feel bad for him
---
Bruh tara piper pam...?

Old brock looked like a criminal, new brock looks more cool now :)

it really makes my day to hear that my art made someone else's day lol &lt;3, ill try my best to make more though ;b

Not unless u r in the final stage

So me voicing my opinion and saying that less effort is being put into each work is selfish and contemptible?
---
Let's go Mortis.
---
But it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs the r/BrawlStars that people use the Leon template. If they use this one, it won‚Äôt have anything to do with brawl stars

We need a way to disable the smoke in solo showdown

Kid this is r/brawlstars

If the card had ‚ÄúBLAARUGGURRHH‚Äù written on it it would fall completely in the laughing category

You did not talk about the daily rewards maaan........

This only makes the game p. 2.w........
---
Penny has still the same smile today!
---
Lol
---
Then change the title. Makes its sound like you discovered this.
---
same
---
Me too
---
They could just pick out individual brawlers, like 6-10 and give them a buff. So people try out new combos and see if anything works well.  
---
Robo rumble is pretty stale when the only team you run is a star power Bull, Jessie and Pam. Although would people even try something new when they know that team will get them 6:15.
---
r/TIHI
---
U mean trophy gates like in CR?
---
I‚Äôd rather get default Ricochet back before getting new skins for the old model, but if for some reason Supercell decided to use the old model again but without the default available I suppose I‚Äôd take it.
---
Why do the brawl boxes look so clean?
---
Just looked up brawlboxes brawlstars lmao this was the first one
---
Nah. Make it such that 2 or 3 cannons can only hit the safe or Ike
---
I saw the old versions of brawlers and I was like hmmm interesting why is Nita's chin so big

(Global player don't shoot me down)

Your post has been removed, make sure to use the body of a post to elaborate on the title.

Just some feedback.
---
1. At first I couldn‚Äôt tell that Jessie was Jessie cause of the glasses ( at least to me)
---
2. Penny‚Äôs to me was perfect but it‚Äôs that her shirt clips into her hip/legs that kinda got me off the 10/10 for penny 
---
3. BiBi just looks kinda wrong as it looks kinda rusty and doesn‚Äôt look like Nita or the other two
---
Other than those tho great job. Also as a male I gota say it, make em thicc.
---
Good luck on your future productions out of all I‚Äôd give your art a solid 7 half/10

Mortis is the only one who can outrun that bastard.
---
You'll eventually max out on pp for Nita and get more for other so ig it's a blessing in disguise
---
My Little Pony might disagree
---
exactly
---
You stole this
---
nice concept!
---
We all know what happened üòè
---
Great but bear a little outsized
---
Put an /s then

Shelly Bandit Skin

I don't know why, but today nearly 8 out of 10 Brawl Ball match I play, my team has 0 BALL CARRIER while the opponent ALWAYS HAS 1 BALL CARRIER, 1 AGGRO, 1 SUPPORT.  The matchmaking system for randoms are the most garbage thing I can ever imagine of Brawl Stars, it's even worse than random. How the hell one team could've ended up with 0 GEM CARRIER IN GEM GRAB WHILE THE OPPONENT HAS POCO AND PAM AT THE SAME TIME??? Seriously, anything, even if it's have to prolong the matchmaking duration, I WANT SPC HAVE TO ADD THE ABILITY TO ORGANIZE A PROPER TEAM COMP AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. Lose because of having dumb team is as bad as stupid randoms throw the game

Bean
---
Sry,is dat fake,because u erased ur own name dude :/
---

---
Hope in the future the Chinese New Year skins come back

Night which mortis is not a creature of the night.
---
Thanksüòâ
---
Take it easy dude
---
Yay
---
How?
---
Aughuahguahghuaghhaguh
---
You should‚Äôve put Carl over rose gold peach üòî
---
Well, Piper can count as well. While she wasn't released with the initial launch, her model, name, description, stats, etc. were in the game.
---
This meme template can't afford four robots sorry
---
&gt;It was a simple suggestion that has been suggested before I'm sure. I didn't ask for this. Leave me alone lol
---
So why would you post if you don't want answers?
---
Well I'll try
---
Ty :)
---
a old 95 year old man
---
I think that 300 coins at 11k are more frustrating :D
---
Only one brawler consistently succeeds, and it's Bibi.
---
Exactly
---
Bitch
---
Thanks even though I saw it before it was deleted
---
So what you killed adrian1998
---
The OG theme is the best, honestly.
---
Wrong sub buddy no
---
Need that lion dance brock one
---
Plz make this change!!
---
Me: hey that‚Äôs pretty good
---
*Realises Bibi isn‚Äôt on there*
---
Me: U DISGUST ME CHILD
---
(Jk it‚Äôs still good)
---
thank you guys! it means a lot!
---
It's because these 2 brawlers can't have skins until they are remodelled. Meanwhile el primo has 2 skins already
---
So you‚Äôre an esper too I assume?
---
Idk I like it, I call it aubergine nose
---
I was looking for other choices...
---
Or l.v.l 1 mortis XD
---
Other choices of what ??
---
Aww thank you man!!
---
Thank you thank you! Ahh, everyone please don't cry!
---
First thing i tough it was N word
---
Well thank you!
---
Normal Difficult :/
---
Thank you! (¬¥‚àÄ`)
---
Thankies!
---
Well, it wasnt in a random brawl ball game, however this game was part of North America open tourney
---
The classic remove 3-4 blocks and puts them back on
---
noice
---
Of winning!! I was losing with Shelly, and other options would came with -500 allies
---
So he got an embarrassing loss in front of hundreds, maybe thousands of people?
---
Massive oof
---
Try playing top hat for hundreds of matches, instead of being stuck in the Mortis Gang conspiracy, then maybe you'll understand.
---
That is what everyone believes. I originally thought he was like a corrupted version of a Barley robot but then when the sniper bots came I think that makes more sense.
---
Press F to rescpest
---
Yeah lol
---
PIPIS!
---
This is pretty awesome
---
Hey chill man. Don't escalate toooo quickly
---
He/She doesn‚Äôt have the hat, that‚Äôs the problem
---
You risk it for that
---
Read like a book, played like a fiddle!
---
U deserved it
---
I think he wants to kiss the -99 votes, not run away from it
---
ah yes of course
---
I also don't like her, actually, i don't like any one of ,,spawners", nita is my lowest trophy brawler
---
Old Rico was ugly af tho
---
Normally the trophies are fairly close to each other, like maybe 20 or 30 apart. Someone who played would know that you absolute imbecile.
---
Me 100/0
---
Wait...
---
I had to buy Leon at 10k and lost all my saved gems ...
---
That enemy primo was pretty awful. Anyways, gg
---
Okey dokey
---
Pam: lol y‚Äôall some cookies
---
People don't realise how awesome this actually is...
---
Hey it‚Äôs not our fault if you were to stick closer to us then you wouldn‚Äôt die
---
Botiful
---
I‚Äôve been waiting so long for someone to make this
---
Lol you're getting so triggered about how stupid you are üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Lol, basically why I put a disclaimer in the title
---
Super cool
---
Oh so the guy who said that i have to max out 1 brawler at the time to farm coins was half right?
---
I don't have to upgrade the brawler to max, i simply have to max out his power points cap.
---
No. BOW DOWN TO YOUR NEW GOD
---
And a Mortis skin
---
And a Crow skin
---
And a Leon skin
---
Bro but how do you not know that trophies are normally not crazily far apart in matchmaking? Genuinely, do you know that? I understand matchmaking isn't PERFECT, but it isn't that bad.
---
the only 'me and the boys' meme iv enjoyed. Thank you.
---
This seems like an absolute waste of my time
---
Cool
---
1984 gang
---
You were able to roll across the map with one automatic charges super which was like 20 seconds and (20 ish tiled long) so you could get stuck in rivers and stuff which made Darryl op in heist
---
Oh yeah, mr GENE
---
I understand. I tried to make it a BIBI skin but my friend said.
---
Ok why is it not a brawler idea.
---
Ic  couldn't  reply to it. 
---
Sooo...
---
Oh no Brock! Look BULLhind you!
---
Weow a better version :v
