Kakashi, we new it was you underneath. 
---
Yeah it's difficult to dodge 10 dynamikes shots per second even with mortis...
---
Man... You have Mortis? He not is easy to play and he not kill bulls and shellys.
---
next thing they will add hats. wait no they are removing them.
---
Oh sorry, i didn't saw that you were the one that posted, when i read for some reason i though that you were someone that was pointing that out as an issue
---

---
But yes, but it could be more simple, idk. Removing the autoaim near Mortis would be hard to program, especialy for it to be used in only one bralwer. 
---
Brave of you to assume it‚Äôs a guy 
---
Wow! It really looks like something supercell would add to the game, good job :)
---
Ok ok the supercell balance this.
---
I like it, as long as you keep the current ranking trophies.  Discouraging teaming is higher on my priority list than removing campers.  
---
The time gets increased?!?!?!? *sad*
---
Wow! What a novel idea! I certainly don‚Äôt see this suggested __every day__
---
When there is a shelly, it is 100% try hard 
---
Purryl
---
Bc why can you jump non stop 
---
wow
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Yeah about that they can also do it to you so its fair fight
---
Yeah, but i put those channels of water so long range brawlers can shoot in without bull being able to get them
---
I cant believe this got 700+ upvotes. 
---
What is this idea bringing to the game?
---
I like these changes and the speed at which they came out. However I would like to mention that ever since the lunar new year update my game‚Äôs been crashing when I load into a game on occasion. I‚Äôm sure this isn‚Äôt the first time you‚Äôve heard about this, but I just thought it was worth mentioning.
---
**just like the P E E K A**
---
Not that much, right now he only strugles to kill shotgunners and Pam, a average/good Mortis player can take anyone out with not much strugle, he is stronger than ever if this new update, so good to play with him.
---
I hardly see them after I got higher up in trophies.
---
Also, check bushes.
---
cool but to much wasted space that would make it even cooler
---
True, bull require no skills they should nerf him
---
*_e p i c  a n t i  t e a m i n g _*
---
Soo, does that mean that you could get like 13-15 trophies if you kill everyone and get 1st place?
---
Well said
---
Wow totally not that website where you can play as gene!

It would be great if that was the case, specially for solo players.
---
Thank you for the clarification 
---
Bruh that‚Äôs how it‚Äôs gonna br
---
Very cool! It is a very restricted in the bases and that would change some strategies a little bit.
---
If mortis shouldnt die to bulls and shellys then which brawlers should he die to? BTW mortis would be much harder to play without auto aim dont you think?
---
Removed - DO NOT SUBMIT POSTS WITH TITLES IN ALL CAPS. CAPS LOCK IS CRUISE CONTROL FOR COOL

He's the only reason i got this game in the first place

Love for that line which was for Pekka

It's all about trophies, isn't it..
---
Real talk
---
How? or just lucky that u came with another random Mortis?

Brave of us to assume its mortal being

That‚Äôs what the changes to pool party were for.

People didnt have the medicine to treat the plague...so people dressed up like a plague docter and they would travel from village to village saying that they would heal the plague for a whole lot of money...of course they where fake tho and the plague killed millions
---
I say both are true, but I think this will result in a lot of brawl ball players choosing fighter class brawlers, rather than defensive brawlers.
---
Ok ok bad idea. Wow i no think you hate his much. Hehe
---
Thx lol
---
If you zoom in and look closely you can see it has some sort of cabines, so a strong guess that it's a Ferris wheel
---
Sounds fun, sadly everytime i play leon everyone tries to kill me.
---
Dynamike
---
Thanks, I hope supercell implements something like that down the line
---
no why
---
What he's thinking: "You know, I could charge into the enemy base when I have all the gems for that one extra kill." Amazing art btw!
---
How did you predict his movement????????????????????  
---
More concerned about your service...
---
Vampike?
---
I was thinking about it recently too
---
What the hell is wrong with the matchmaking in this video? The brock beingat 51 trophies???
---
Ur a noob and u get paired with noobs, whats wrong with that
---
Who is the creator of the map? 
---
Are you in the allies family because there is someone in there who's dynamike is as tilted as u (I forget who)
---
Ninja skins would be awesome. They should make a set, and give the 3 mythic brawlers all ninja skins. Two right now already fit the theme (tara and mortis) and i dont see how gene would be too far off. 
---
No they don‚Äôt want a k/d/a because the game isn‚Äôt about kills, it‚Äôs about objectives 
---
Lmfaoo
---
I NEED IT NOW
---
Pen and ink?
---
As are other moba styled games, yet they have the ratio available. No reason to hide the information, at least have it for games like duo showdown
---
Omg we have a sub for calc class tomorrow... hoping to meet el primo
---
Played a game of duos half the teams where Daryl 
---
Is that Robin Thicke? xd
---
this is why i wake up in the morning
---
NO! Ninja Leon! NINNNJA LEONNN
---
What grade you got?
---
Not happy about matchmaking just because I can't play with my noob friends.
---
But kudos to SC on handling these bugs so quickly. The fact that they let the robo rumble exploit slide but patched a competitive exploit so fast really says alot.
---
They actually DO care about their game =') 
---
What?

What do you mean??üòÇ

eXcEpT gEnE

Is this an idea?

OooohüòÇShitüôèüèªnice catch , I do need service tho 
---
Idea??o.O
---
But if I had to choose a brawler I‚Äôd say Shelly only because you start with her so it makes sense
---
Probably yeah, but if they implement this I think it might be Colt because in my opinion he is the face of Brawl Stars 
---
No one tile gaps please
---
This should be considered as cheating... 
---
I‚Äôm not trying to say that. What I‚Äôm trying to say is that you shouldn‚Äôt talk about fairness when (a) the match was actually pretty fair and (b) you had a pretty big advantage in the match.
---
All the best.
---
Supercell be like: i got your nose
---
Oh I just flip my phone when that happens lol
---
Ok
---
El Primo isn‚Äôt just here, he‚Äôs everywhere
---
F
---
If you use photoshop, the photoshop file is available, so you can do whatever you want yourself!
---
That‚Äôs just a slower el primo who hides in bushes. Lame.
---
This would be a cool skin for like summer or Earth  Day.
---
i always use my *regular* attacks instead of my super
---
i agree with what you say
---
Gosh, I love it. Definitely a big want!
---
Yeah, 90% of the people here are stupid thinking bull in the bush is a problem in showdown. No one even talked about it before the noobs rushed into the game and the only problem that people mentioned and actually acknowledged was teaming.
---
That is because RN it is better to watch people Duke it out and stay hidden than to come out at the last minute to steal.
---
Also, by making it about kills it would reduce strategy options like survival fighters (pocos) or zoners (barleys).
---
If you think bulls and dps heroes are dominating, making it about kills....
---
WAIT WHAT YOU WANT IS BOUNTY!!!
---
Top ten anime crossovers 
---
Yeah, don't know much about reddit currently.
---
This hit too close. *cries*
---
Oh, and if you stop to explain - you are a goner 
---
You could maybe keep the Japanese theme and make Mortis like a samurai 
---
That's the downside to stopthespin, too many people are true teamers.
---
One of my favourite characters easily
---
Don't forget about Leon Bull Pam though
---
We have to reach the devs, and talk to them about the changes.
---
Yeah I swear I can never get my super when I need it I waste like 5 seconds every time I try to super
---
That one is my fav
---
How about a day ban for if you score against your team mates and a week if you do it twice?
---
That's just bounty with extra steps
---
I remember back in the day SC replied to one of these posts and said we don't need to report, they're watching from their side ([link](https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/8eb9bh/fair_play_in_brawl_ball/dxtu3gr/?context=3))
---
Yeah, but I think he's trying to say betraying won't do much because they'll just brush off that one game where there is a backstabber because most people are true teamers, allowing them to gain trophies more than he lost in that one game he got backstabbed.
---
why would you auto aim with poco, it really lowers his effectiveness
---
Before and After Hat Mortis üòä I‚Äôm ok with this.
---
Please kill my brawler too lol
---
Being cocky can be really funny but not the best idea
---
Exactly, I hate double trouble for that reason.
---
*eskimo is here*
---
This legit looks like genderswapped bob the builder lmao
---
Atleast i am doing my part,u know?
---
Teaming is balanced? Are you stupid? How does it seem balanced when 9 dynamikes are trying to kill 1 bull? What is the bull supposed to do?
---
That's how mafia works
---
It's better just to wait for the epic 
---
Make way for the hero.
---
Lol I love this a lot. But I do wonder what they will look like if the bear was Batman and Nita was robin (since robin is smaller than Batman)
---
rn I'm imagining supercell making the next limited skins at 150 too but with a higher number "discounted"
---
It it's anythinglike Clash Royale, if they patch it you'll be stuck with the color code in your name
---
You are a true God of defeating teamers
---
I want f1ddl3s help

I hate this damn game. 
---
Gonna go play 50 rounds of showdown now 
---
I know lol
---
Brawl stars on drugs 
---
I started like a week after the game came out and I‚Äôm only at like 9.5 k
---
Need to beat it again
---
True
---
yeah i agree you should ask for upvotes but you need to be more welcoming to new redditors they dont know better
---
-attract attention so ur teammates can kill them easier.
---
-never attack a shotgunner, even if it's the last enemy in sdüò≠ u have no chanceü§ß
---
-take all gems in gem grab.
---
-get close to frank, let him use his super and dodge it.
---
-steal in showdownüòè
---
-attract attention in heist by running straight to the safe(unless u know u will not survive it) to give your teammates the time to prepare for an "attack" or "amBUSH"
---
troll primos, because primos are the most annoying brawlers in the game, unless u're playing with mortisüòè just show him every corner of the map (by getting closer and running away) 
---
-don't dash to dodge, mortis' cooldown already is 73847337 days long. (unless u're playing against a mike or barley) 
---
Outstanding move!
---
suprimo
---
Thanks! I submitted this in the Brawler concept contest by u/phlorpe! I hope it gets noticed!
---
Wow. This conversation is going so well. I love when it doesn't just devolve into anger for a point of view. I do love this game and think they did a great job with it. But even I've gotten super sad about the trophy loss and wanted to find something to put that frustration on (END TEAMING SUPERCELL!!! ARRRGGGG!!!). But when I sat back and thought about it, I was really only limiting myself and my overall enjoyment of the game over my belief that I had been unfairly punished. I wasn't mad at the teamers, I was mad at the game for punishing me for playing. After that, I started having more fun using teaming as a tool to get what I wanted which was more trophies. I rarely use it even now that I've had the change of heart but I don't think all the call for bans and "solutions" really help people address the real problem or address their real frustration. I just want to help people focus that frustration into more meaningful dialogue directed at the core problem and not just at each other over opinions.  
---
Yeah you‚Äôre right I should chill out a bit. But if you look at his comment history all he does is advertise YouTube and lie. Just salty for some reason I guess.
---
lol he calls it yesterday's heist map
---
lol lets call that "war"
---
Yikes guys, I have most brawlers mostly because I got them BEFORE the updates... I'm only missing Leon :/ I got Crow recently from a mega box on the trophy road, but my legendary rate was at 0.798% which may explain why :/
---
You‚Äôre telling me you want a buff to autoaim. Noob. 
---
It was overkill to increase spawn time by 40%, would have preferred a smaller change. I also actually liked the old spawn time, was difficult to score but made things like "field position" important. 
---
dash and destroy
---
Wtf???
---
I propose when destroyed, the cube moves towards the closest player
---
I need healing.
---
Yea but I‚Äôm going to offer some advice. The star power damages people if they touch it. People will obviously know about it and they won‚Äôt go near it only in certain situations such as the poison is closing in. Maybe something else would be better
---
Gg man
---
Lmao that's actually true, bounty is my favorite mode.
---
Dynamike and Darryl ftw
---
merciless..
---
Ah, thank you
---
There is glitch?
---
thats one hecc of a long darryl super
---
Man you make great concepts. Keep up the good work! Can I ask what you use to make these out of curiosity? Photoshop or illustrator maybe?
---
Im sure it's based on your skill.
---
Spike got the Sharpshooter title, but it's a legendary, when lower rarity brawlers also got it. Also, is there a barrier that denies the Fighter title to any non-trophy road brawler? Or a barrier that denies Throwers above rare? So many examples can be given...
---
Was looking to get one but the shipping is ridiculous, almost as much as the plush itself 
---
this happens to me in the middle of a game and its cost me at least 120 trophies
---
I‚Äôm going to leave an otherwise worthless comment here in the hopes that Supercell checks these forums and posts. 
---
I 100% agree with you. My random matchmaking instantly went from win some, lose some team up with good fandoms and win a few together to every match I get in my underpowered brawlers get crushed and I lose most of my random matches. I have to play with my highest powered brawlers to win a random or the couple that I‚Äôm really good with and god help me if they end up being on the lower end of the power levels in the map. As soon as I try out a new brawler my random team is destroyed. One example of just poor matching is I joined a heist match. My team was all ranged or throwers and their team was primo, bull and Shelly. 
---
Supercell keep working at the matchmaking for this game. 
---
Good modes!
---
Essentially, the goal of the game is to score 200 points (or to have the most points after 5 minutes)
---
Basic rules of bounty apply to this game (stars are each worth 1 point).
---
Bringing gems back to your safe give 2 points for each gem.
---
Scoring a goal rewards you with 10 points.
---
Destroying a safe rewards you with 100 points.
---
This massive 10v10 battle has some different rules from gamemodes such as duo showdown. Each player must collect their own power cubes, as they are not shared. Dying makes you drop 50% of your power cubes for others to pick up.
---
The blue and red cages (made out of old-school barriers and TNT boxes) represent each teams' goals. 
---
In 2 corners lie each team's bases where gems are deposited and their safe is.
---
In the other 2 corners are bush patches with a brawl ball in the center. When a goal is scored, the ball respawns in the bush patch.
---
Because the game is so long (maximum 5 minutes) it would make sense for bushes to respawn (if Supercell approves).
---
Overall, this game mode is 99% not going to be added but it's just a fun idea to think that we could see some massive collaboration of every game mode.
---
Thank you for reading.
---
Let unoriginal people kill things. It‚Äôs what they do
---
why el primo is a duck
---
Just kind of interesting cuz that never happens
---
"have much fear"
---
the fire should be under his legs
---
If this gamemode has any leverage to become a reality, I'm sure supercell will do a better job at placing enough boxes for 20 people.
---
Thanks :)
---
Yep! I‚Äôm nearing all my guys at 300 trophies each at the moment and I literally only play showdown to do it because I can‚Äôt rely on randoms for the 3v3 games AT ALL.
---
I have no luck with the other game types unless my buddy is online.
---
Times like this when there‚Äôs only on showdown map to choose from and it‚Äôs no bueno for one reason or another, I just end up on reddit instead. Lol
---
It‚Äôs a clan tag
---
That‚Äôs their ‚Äúclan‚Äù
---
1v1 in Brawler Stars, I‚Äôll beat you
---
I don‚Äôt want to lose with you anymore*
---
It just doubles power points but that would‚Äôve been lit!
---
That was my guess, but where it originated? It's the only kind of clan tag used in the name I've seen, and I see them usually like a couple different ones a day, different name but same tag
---
Wait. By this logic Leon has infinite hoodies underneath his first one.  
---
This is evident by the fact that he is unaware of the fact that anything else should be present.
---
Despite Brawl Stars no longer having a Wild West theme, it is evident that showdown maps are very hot (it's a desert).
---
Therefore, Leon should have died of heatstroke long ago.
---
Supercell, you got some explainin' to do.
---
Well I never seen mortis in rock because there's a lot of tanks
---
Do a puffer fish spike
---
That was clean üòÇ
---
This happened to me today. I was like "just six more trophies then I'll get back to work." Negative twenty trophies later: "What have I done."
---
You are a disgrace for not using the hat
---
I approve this skin. üòç

He is otherwise Kite Bait when he has no bush. 
---
You have to be under 3k for? I'm 4.3 but why 3k specifically? To have weak bots? 
---
to death
---
Leon would get over 4 trophies a game under top 5 because the only way to kill a Leon is by  teaming or supercell nerfs his damage and speed, it's ridiculous how brain dead he is
---
Ok, this is epic
---
thanks you help me too xD another noob 
---
About to join now. I should be well over 3500k right now but playing with randoms is doom. My IG name is Jace.
---
Not me, but I am trying to push rico to 500 on showdown altough maybe that isnt the best choice
---
Everytime I try to dodge throwers attack someone comes to me and kill me
---
Shut up, even if you‚Äôre joking. His name is Leon, it‚Äôs a guy. This world is getting pathetic. 
---
Congrats!
---
But how many maps have bushes. Especially showdown. Regrow makes bull a too strong especially in showdown look at previous meta before update
---
Everyone tries to kill you immediately.
---
No mercy for that Leon.
---
I‚Äôm at 5500 and am still at 16 brawlers. I have decided that I want to die.
---
Me with my 2 400 trophy brawlers :(
---
Don't use all 3 shots unless you can kill them.
---
Amo conservation is an important part of playing throwers
---
If you weren't able to get revenge on that penny don't talk to me

Kakashi Hatake
---
I use brock
---
It's solo. either you respect the mide of game or you change of mode. There the players who put themselves in 5 in which surely 3 or 4 in voice ... serious what is that? When you team 2 at the end of the game already it's not cool for the last ... but here at 5 out of 10 ...
---
Yesss please 
---
Its already in the game. Its called "Friendly games ".
---
Ser has more uses
---
I know your feelings bro
---
he chose a different brawler, so he did not hit "play again", so, knowing the amount of people playing...
---
it's not always due to random teammates. sometimes your team gets countered by opponent's team composition. also there are times when you fail to land shots  which can make you lose. another problem is that  you can't trust others with gems so everyone tries to pick them and causes more chances for opponents to land shots or splash. 
---
Still pretty random to me. Only worked in certain angles, tried to do it in a custom game to test, sometimes it worked, sometimes it didnt. Might in fact not be random, but still not reliable either
---
Whenever I‚Äôm dealing with that level of bush it only takes me 2 minutes too

Theres 4 brawlers who stand a chance in todays map. Leon: destroyer of teams Mortis : dynamikes have nightmares about him dynamike and barley: JOIN THEM

Either stopping regen while in proximity of an enemy, or remove regen and make it so you can regain full health from a power box.

eXCusE mE

Let‚Äôs settle this beef

And you have 500 in 1 year, that's the exact same ratio.

The weebs have struck again
---
Lol that‚Äôs Dav I know him
---
everytime i watch this, it gets even better
---
Frank has a pretty annoying attack delay, so a Mortis user with good timing can attack right as Frank uses his attack to move past Frank's hit range. 
---
Or well... That's what I usually do. Idk about what the other Mortis did

Haha, no worries

Straight up
---
Leon deserved to lose solely because he just auto aimed all his shots smh
---
Haha thanks man
---
Thank you! I used Illustrator
---
As I remember it's all start by some top clubs(I won't say the name) trying to enter in a match at same time and teaming together... Than supercell hide names on showdown and fix matchmaking... And here we are
---
Supercell cursed u now u will lose all Ur trophies
---
More like: there‚Äôs no fucking reason to play you because supercell doesn‚Äôt care about 500+
---
Poco 500 is so stressful, gem grab w randoms is too risky so I played solo showdown to make top 200 US
---
Holy, i didn't expect that coming Kkkkkkkkk nice 
---
no one ever know what's behind his hoodie, even myself
---
Well played then!!
---
They won‚Äôt do it because iPhones are standardized, but there‚Äôs a million different androids each with different levels of notch, and one phone is even getting a holepunch (which is the stupidest thing ever IMO, and an absolute pain in the arse to work with for developers because it‚Äôll be a deadzone on the screen)
---
[If]&gt;{player}&gt;shoot&lt;1&gt;{bones}&gt;[then]&gt;break&lt;all&gt;{wall}
---
Now give me the money
---
I mean all that‚Äôs happening is he is attacking at a shorter range because it‚Äôs directly straight at the enemy. If he aimed imperfectly it would be better so it‚Äôs not that he needs it but it could be that he‚Äôs bragging about using it with that handicap
---
Yeah, I suppose, but it's worth giving a try
---
+1 every 2 kills
---
tip applying to any brawler: get a premade teammate / teammates you enjoy playing with. dont go for randoms.2
---
If only power levels were the same too lol
---
Im at a bit over 5k, randoms will be fine for now. Maybe when I get highee
---
This should be a custom game mode 
---
My friend Ivan has 13 brawlers and he is at 4K...
---
That jump animation looks a little clunky. At first I thought this was a glitch you were experiencing.
---
No hat mortis almost cost u an upvote
---
And add the kill counter at right top 
---
I am innocent!!
---
the logic is clearly to end randoms (for example) being 2000 total trophies matching up with you and you as a 6.3k to stop being matched up with newbies, effectively stopping both smurfing and bad matchmaking, buddy...
---
Why would it remind you that? its not eve- Wait what is going on in this video?
---
Thx

Oh my! Yes indeed

Went through hell and back

Ofc

Lemme know if you do

What !!!
---
Tell that to the judge. You're coming with us!
---
I got a brawler up to 500 but it was too tempting,I couldn‚Äôt resist not playing Bull since his good frien is a bush,so I got him up to 544 I‚Äôm on the leaderboard now.
---
Umm
---
Go away, Crow
---
Order?
---
 I played against Dav Many times too
---
How many total trophies do you have?
---
I love playing Dynamike.. My Mortis is only power 3 and he just gets deleted. I‚Äôm a fan of Bareley as well but it doesn‚Äôt change the fact that people do stupid stuff like going for kills in Gem Grab while holding 9 gems and the countdown is going.
---
It‚Äôs just absurd.. do these new people not understand that kills don‚Äôt actually matter unless it‚Äôs in Bounty? What the hell.
---
And Brocks old potrait
---
This is to prevent top players playing with other top players smurf to gain easy trophies to the leaderboard. 
---

Will do! Thanks man.

Playing with randoms is a better showdown than showdown.

*slaps it off*

Very funny

Before you ask, yes, this design is based off of Wolf's design from Super Smash Bros. Ultimate!

 Very obvious: your teammate was named ‚Äúi never lose‚Äù

Come back with attack mechanics

How do u make these

But darryl has 2 double barrels shotgun... i should be quiet

It's made of clay.

Without super BULL. With super Shelly all the way.
---
Ye but that was your relative dude
---
whut, that's literally my job! steal and run away, he already has a trashy range
---
Teaming in solo showdown smh it's called SOLO for a reason
---
Are you familiar with that expression?
---
The whole point of the mode is to kill strategically. A bull sitting still for 2 minutes and popping 3 shots off as you round a corner isn't overly skill full just like running in shooting isn't.
---
I have played 400+. Its the only time it's fun and has stopped me playing with new characters in showdown until they are rank 16.
---
His point was running around getting kills requires no skill. Sitting still requires a tap every 10 seconds only. Little skill there also.
---
There's really no other answer to your question so hearing it from me won't make a difference. Get it?
---
3 Months... Iam at 11,7 k now.
---
Congrats dude
---
Alright negative nancy.
---
Dude go 400+ with any brawler you will have absolutely 0 chance to win if you don't team, you will see.
---
Sure it is toxic but you can't do anything to stop it so you are forced to do it as well.
---
Wow nice! Do you have all the brawlers? And do you have any maxed?
---
Go fuck yourself.
---
Lol
---
Darryl‚Äôs one of the most versatile brawlers right now, he can be played in all game modes
---
I bet they could find a solution!üí™
---
I just noticed woody is dabbing
---
I have em all and they are maxed, too.
---
Keep up the grind, mate. Happy brawling ! :-)
---
Oh ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
If they are better they gonna pass this trophies range soon and won't play with you (and others on ~400) anymore. 
---
so if they are shit - this is exactly the place where they should be (at ~400). And if they cannot pass this trophies range quite fast it's mean their games are not so one-sided with the people on this range. And people on ~400 has quite good chance to beat them. 
---
Power level shouldn't be taken into consideration (at least as high or even medium priority) for matchmaking. Other way there won't be any meaning to level up your brawler; in this case it's better to just remove the power system at all (ofc it won't happen, that's not how you do business :D ) 
---
"You team with any brawler that wants to team with you". Oh okay so I'm just gonna team with a bull as crow. Do you even think before writing? And you are the one stating I'm asking dumb questions shake my fucking head.
---
I will call it Ninja Hattori Tara üòçüòçüòç
---
Hmmm, you cannot be f2p!
---
Why Iam hard right now
---
Don‚Äôt lose then ok 
---
Good idea!
---
Iam not. I spent money on it.
---
I know exactly how to fix this...
---
Life leach
---
This is insane 
---
I know, but it's pathetic and you're only contributing to this pest. Just because someone else does it doesn't mean you have to. If you can't win without cheating try other game modes.
---
Cool but they will never use it
---
Idk how to add the photo here.. without link
---
No thanks, I'd rather contribute to this pest.
---
Iam not f2p. I spend money on it! ;-)
---
Who cares?
---
Press F to pay respect! 
---
R u on the global leaderboards?
---
Think iam. 800 ish i guess. Not sure, can look it up.
---
I'd like to see you find a bull that wants to team up with a crow or any other brawler. Never seen a bull actually spin to team in my countless games in showdown. If you're going to use an example at least make it realistic.
---
I know it‚Äôs not gonna happen but.. I thought it‚Äôd be fun to draw her. 
---
Why not just block the invites for 5 minutes?
---
Nah iam not on top 200 global. 
---
Nice keep up the work !
---
You too mate, happy brawling!:-)
---
When making a post you have to choose picture instead of text
---
I haven‚Äôt noticed much difference (10.5k). I might be getting matched with more teammates that aren‚Äôt below 7k, but I haven‚Äôt played a huge number of matches.
---
I feel like you and alot of other players largely overestimate star powers
---
I make another post
---
All I see is everyone spinning above 400. I'm gonna upload a video in 10 mins and link it to you where the whole fucking lobby teamed up and was just waiting for someone to shoot so that they can massacre him. 
---
Its free, be thankful 
---
You reach higher trophies level, of course there will be more people with maxed brawlers. 
---
Also now on ~400 more players with maxed brawler. This is just the thing on this range. If you still play here (on this range) after as you said "keep getting full power 10 enemy teams" and didn't drop but has some problem with climbing it's mean this is the exact trophies range you should be. 
---
So assuming that this is the trophies range where you get close to 50% win rate there are 2 options for you: 
---
1) power up your brawler (since you still have some spaces to do it) 
---
2) improve your skill - there is almost no limitation to this probably. 
---
With your skills and power level rn maybe it's for good that you cannot climb higher for now. 
---
Congrats dude, have fun playing em!
---
You are so lucky you sick me
---
I posted this idea in january, very good idea
---
You should start selling
---
Might even become a millionare with that quality
---
Are you selling any of these? I wouldn't mind having a Spike for my desk
---
Fake I say
---
Showdown is an unbalanced mode. It‚Äôs the only mode you can play without having to rely on other players. Playing a character with a low TTK, like Mortis or Crow, and coming out the winner is high skill. 
---
I can confirm it is much, much easier to run around as bull, one of my favorite characters, and shoot everyone after collecting all the jars in the middle. Then it is for me to squeeze a victory out as Mortis.
---
Didn‚Äôt say anything about camping being skillful. Being a  Vulture doesn‚Äôt mean camping. It also means stealing kills and targeting weak links. It takes more strategy which is why it‚Äôs a higher skill.
---
Better than meteors 
---
Lets hope so...
---
You still get free boxes but you have to be licky
---
Tara looks so good
---
Amazing art and Idea!!!!!
---
Leon needs a buff
---
This is the way it should be...  Should someone with 10k trophies that unlocks a new brawler be matched against someone who just installed the game?  Doesn't a higher total trophy count imply that that player likely has more skill regardless of the brawler they play?  You were essentially exploiting the previous matchmaking system to be able to play with less skilled players.  Unfortunately for you they fixed it.
---
You forgot el primo
---
I don't like it crow should be legendary
---
Lol. This is funny! Sure many ppl would agree with your sentiment
---
They don't have to necessarily be throwing simply because they are playing ranged kits
---
They didn‚Äôt really tho. Any brawlers above 300 trophies prioritize brawler trophies over total trophies. So you still can get 3k or less people who can‚Äôt play with a 400 leon. 
---
I want rockstar poco
---
"Solo" showdown
---
That looks some real dedication!
---
Except you weren't necessarily put into matches with new players. You would go into matches with other players with new brawlers 
---
Agree
---
You got all the brawlers through purchased boxes so that's p2w. Just telling ya
---
the bot does not take over for afk players. they just stay in spawn till the "afk warning" shows up and shoot/move for 1 second then stay afk again.
---
how about for players that score the goal to your own goal in purpose? 
---
ive seen too much of these while pushing with randoms (people arent always available to queue up with in higher trophies). please make random 3v3s a better experience. 
---
I was just about to say! NICE WORK! 
---
Which brawler are you playing
---
Why don't you guys upvote it?
---
You can still aim it to hit multiple targets.......
---
How could a mean person get his fanart of Gene in a youtubers thumbnail ü§î
---
Rocker Mortis not fed up?) 
---
Yeah no. Improving his ability to force his opponents to wait longer for a heal is a bad idea, since it‚Äôs Crow‚Äôs biggest strength. Also, match length was just cut down for some modes. How about improving his damage per projectile by 15% and reducing poison damage ticks by 10%? 
---
Why is it unfair?  Matchmaking is based on trophies (player skill), not player power.  The guy obviously has less skill than you.
---
That‚Äôs stupid they won‚Äôt make Crow A Mythic 
---
More like Brock's skin
---
Pay to lose

I prefer that instead of 7 Bulls hiding in the middle bush on some SD maps and who are just waiting

Can u make one and ship it to me and tell me how much it cost as well

We just recently made a spike skin but surely we can try to make this skin, it sounds a pretty fun skin
---
Also there is no teaming wich is really nice, on my main there is always a bunch of throwing teamers on the current map
---
I mean it took cr almost 3 years to implement it we cant complain 
---
Bubbles or maybe octopus ink, we really didn‚Äôt had a conclusion

I always thought your work was 3D printed, but actually u made such awesomness with some basic tools, fking awesome man!

I know how you feel *cough* *cough* Bull is for Noobs *cough*
---
It would make more sense to introduce an incremental currency / token system for brawlers over 500 that has a different reward structure that adds to the meta game.
---
What does the best players in the world have to do with anything I said?
---
I said that the advantage goes to them witch is obvious, for all of us who don't plan to become pros in a mobile game..
---
I never said that you can't win tho. Learn to read before rushing into shitposts 
---
Barley makes huge dressing efforts but is still barely noticed by females...
---
Interesting ü§î
---
This is one of the best I have seenüòÇüòÇ
---
Lol true 
---
Poco is actually really great at showdown when you team, he can win a lot of 1v1s because of his heal or he can use his super to stay alive longer at the end of a match when everyone is backstabbing each other 
---
in regards to your solos duos argument.. teaming in solos is very different from having a teammate in duos, in solos you have a very temporary truce and most people backstab when their teammate is at low health 
---
If you haven‚Äôt seen much teaming you are probably very low in trophies, I understand where you are coming from if that‚Äôs the case because support brawlers like poco aren‚Äôt used much there, however showdown is very different game mode once you get higher in trophies 
---
ill downvote him so u can be the 69
---
Leon ruins the game anytime I play against him. It's not even funny. Then they even turn out to be a couple lvls lower. 
---
Didn‚Äôt refer to the Frank speaking about sd in general lul

Or actually aim because you need to aim to be good at the game and carry your team because you have actually good game sence
---
Ok!
---
YE dude, I was trying to say that since the beggining, Spike's first description refered him as 'HE' and I don't think the skin changes the gender (-_-)
---
Pam and colt are bro sis, Pam and bull are couples with 2 daughters penny and Jessie 
---
Well your point would be better made if you just stated the first br game instead of just throwing a random one out, just trying to help buddy üòâ
---
I don't think Mortis is the hardest...
---
  
---
You clearly can win a lot of trophies by avoiding every fights in showdown. In gem grab he's good to take gems and go away instantly.
---
Stats are very balanced...except for the speed. Fast movement speed can make the brawler hard to hit and should only be used if they would struggle getting up close or have lackluster stats to begin with. He should have the normal movement speed like all other brawlers imo.
---
For the art style, it looks very good, but it seems too complex to be a character in Brawl Stars. Keep in mind they would have to make all those details when making the model so simpler is better ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
So you argue that auto aim should work when there are no boxes around and it should suck when there are boxes around?!? Don't you find this inconsistent?
---
Nah this is more like colt during his puberty as an edgy teenager
---
They usually leave if u lose another which ia kinda sad :( like *WHY?*
---
Please make him a hitscan brawler. It's something that brawl stars needs, 23 brawlers and still all projectile, hitscan would change the game alot but also making aim more important.
---

The first ever br game was actually an arma mod but some people consider minecraft hunger games a br game as well so it‚Äôs unclear what exactly was the first br game and most people don‚Äôt even know about those gamemodes/games that‚Äôs why I pointed out a more popular one. ‚Äúbuddy‚Äùüòâ
---
Doesn't worküò´
---
In that case it should only choose the enemy, which I believe it does, choose the closets target but I could be wrong.
---
I didn‚Äôt have any issues with these bugs UNTIL I saw this post wtf explain. 
---
You put your trophies on the line playing past 500 and your rewards is having your trophies simply vanish 
---
No! You don't need to use autoaim everytime, you have to know when to use it and when not, spamming a buton requires no skill and it is your own fault if you use it in the neiberhoud of a box! 
---
THIS EXPLAINS EVERYTHING. That's why I got Crow for free. It wasn't a legendary for all this time lol
---
r/woosh
---
I hate these Darryls, all I wanna do is just fight someone for power up then suddenly s dares just came out of nowhere and third party us
---
YEP!
---
I also have been awaiting a legendary. I dont mind what legendary. I would just like one
---
Playing in Australia, Adelaide on 4G, straight up all I can say is the 2-second delay for attacks/ultimates ruins the game. Still playable, but borderline fun/unfun.
---
 I recently unlocked Piper and her ultimate is rather useless with the input lag, by the time you've dragged her ultimate and waiting for it to go off, it's already too late, you're dead.
---
I don't want Crow to be mythic! Having him as a legendary was the only thing that made me proud of my luck. SUPERCELL DO NOT RUIN THIS GOD DAMNIT

TIL

I play the game too just saying it would be much more enjoyable if it were fairer.

*Press X to doubt*

Meanwhile im down here with bulls, shellys and primos at 300

can I whoosh you

REVELATION

Guess it‚Äôs subjective but h1 is the first official stand alone BR game, I‚Äôll give you a pass buddy üòâ
---
With 300 boxes, your chances are still the same as with 1 box. If you don't get it, then imagine you have a 27000% chance to get PowerPoints.
---
Thats your opinion :D
---
This is sick. I like the corralling entrances/exits in the center
---
Fun fact: They were all teaming.
---
And in that game was totally 8 bulls
---
Niiice
---
That means nothing 
---
Thanks for the compliment but it's true indeed! It actually is my first time drawing :D
---
Someone be salty
---
How do you do it?
---
I think his super daggers should do more damage not the poison of the daggers but only super daggers just my opinion 
---
Well, Colt shoots six straight long-range shots out of his revolvers .But this new brawler shoots a single bullet . Which is more like Jessie's attack. However it does less damage than Jessie but has a great super.
---
they mentioned in update list
---
Those were bots
---
Me, nah. Im just surprised that someone took the actual effort to dig through my posts and find one that was popular lol.
---
As for downvoting my comments every time I say something, I‚Äôm not sure whose the one who‚Äôs salty here.  Hmm...

I got crow in a regular brawl box so if it's true oh well he'll be my first mythic.

Wait, since the boxes were in the past once gene comes out, does that mean that all of the boxes you open won‚Äôt have gene in it?
---
Now instead of a ‚ÄúFree Box‚Äù you have an extra 100 tokens... which is a ‚ÄúFree Box‚Äù. Are people just lazy to play for tokens or ungrateful?

As someone who doesn‚Äôt team; definitely is not ‚Äúwithout a question‚Äù. But not really the argument here. I still don‚Äôt see how matchmaking bamboozled you; just the players in the lobby themselves. 
---
That used to be how you bought boxes but then later changed it to tokens
---
This is a shitpost of another level!
---
Hate that mode,to much random and bugs,better it be some another gem grab or heist.
---
I don't like the blocks around the mine. Makes it very easy to sneak in and grab a gem. Not a good quality.
---
no
---
üòÇ maybe maybe
---
yet my rant about darryl got deleted. Why is this in r/BrawlStars
---
Look at it however you want, matchmaking isn't the main point of the post
---
It looks great
---
You'll still see a primo running around
---
He needs to be better than Leon, then he won‚Äôt need more buffs
---
So, I don't have Daryl.  Does his super charge up over time or something?  Or charge by shooting at nothing?  I constantly see him getting his super charged without hitting anything and it confuses me. 
---
Feels bad man. Hope you get them back soon.

You deserve a million upvotes.

r/lostredditors

Thanks

You can definitely speed it up; the other people you were playing with got there before you and hit the play again. There is also no way you should miss the play again button because of the animation.

Cross finger for crow.I dont want him as mythic
---
You can hear voice lines of locked brawlers by tapping on them
---
One of my favs but not the best because spawning bottom left is a setup for failure lol. 
---
He will be released the day after the lunar pack deal expires, guaranteed!
---
I believe originally play again was cutoff under a certain number of trophies; which has now been changed to 150 trophies from what it originally was (no idea what the original value was). 
---
Whatever helps you sleep better at night. ‚úåÔ∏è

Crow will always be legendary, he is really good so screw making him a mythic

Exactly. 500 isn‚Äôt a problem for me, but when you get to 600, it just get intense. The highest i‚Äôve got with a brawler was 700 tho.

I think that they should change his star power so that when he poisons opponents their movement speed gets decreased while they‚Äôre poisoned

And his Super is red and hot like fire

Oh, that‚Äôs fine! I just don‚Äôt like it when people get treated like that. ^^

The players that you played against were bad. This ain't an exploit. It's hilarious to think that you global players would know more than beta players :&gt;
---
I am at 3.5k and playing random. I guess I am also in the more challenging group
---
Gene
---
This is a great idea! One issue it might cause would be camping, especially towards the end.
---
Lol. Assuming that‚Äôs a joke. Only because that‚Äôs so far disconnected from how the game works that I have to assume you‚Äôre joking. 
---
Of course there is... gemmers man. They got all lvl 10 before starting playing the game
---
It's to make up for his range, but this is just an idea to make that mobility the focus of his character.
---
To be honest, I‚Äôve been very unlucky till recently. After playing this game for over 1.5 years since the beginning of the beta it was irritating to see all these new players getting mythic‚Äôs and legendaries so quickly and when they were just starting.  
---
Once I got all the rare and super rare brawlers which took me a long time. I went months without getting a new brawler till I finally got my first epic. After that it was like clockwork. Few weeks later I got the other two epics within a week. Then less then a month later I got a cheap Mythic offer, had enough gems and got Tara. Later that week I got Mortis from a box. Then recently an offer for Leon popped up, so bought some gems cause he‚Äôs the main brawler I‚Äôve been wanting since he was added. By far the most I‚Äôve ever spent on a IAP ever though. Usually I might buy $2 or $5 bundles occasionally but never a $20 standard gem pack like I had to do to buy him. From getting Mortis my Legendary odds dropped very low. Except yesterday I somehow got Spike, which was a nice unexpected surprise for sure. 
---
Keep trying and I‚Äôm bet your luck with change. I really didn‚Äôt expect it since my luck was seriously nonexistent for awhile
---
It's hilarious you still can't read my point. You clearly didn't read of high trophy chars still doing this exploit anywhere either did you?
---
Whats your user. Let's play boss

Unrelated but great shots

If you marketed these, I would totally buy a few! Good work, dude!

This reply was made by mortis gang

No, unless its your main/you really like playing him

I have died many times to all the brawlers... except crow. Crow in my opinion NEEDS to be mythic. He isn't at the same level as Leon and Spike

Yesss he needs a samurai hat or something!

Just a question, do u have to get them power lvl 9 or actual lvl 9?

I mean it's fine you're beta, probably play all day every day. So of course I may not be as good but you fail to know when someone afks out. Because the ally or enemy won't move from the beginning briefly.

Then starts demolishing. Then he will pause again (the player is checking in before the games over for trophies)
---
I know this because I've seen someone do it right next to me. 
---
If you don't wanna play any friendly games that's fine. I'm willing even to know I'm bad but you're coward to even prove yourself. Weak. 
---
Imagine a separate skin where he has a rice paddy hat!

This is great, i wish they had a random loading screen to look at each time we log in or go into a battle, one loading screen makes it feel boring. And there is a lot of potential. Like going into a new match you could have a loading screen for that game mode. Like a gem mine loading screen for gem grab. 
---
third party can happen but thats not the majority of my deaths, its when I get a kill and then someone appears outa a bush and just 1 shot me cuz im low after outplaying someone. Im in a high elo, and literally everyone does it so first off it would solve a lot of "boosted" shelly and bull since those two are the most prone to hide and clean. Boosted meaning they are high trophies when they arent that good with the brawler. Thats not how brawl stars or a system to track skill and achievement should be...
---
Wow this post is going to completely blow up, this skin is so awesome
---
How?
---
There was a doubler deal in December. 2010 tokens for 69 gems.
---
This is a funny statement because I had 500 regular boxes, 25 big and 3 megaboxes saved when Leon came out and I didn‚Äôt get him from any of those. Then I bet 80 tickets in Robo getting max rewards + key doublers and after opening 50 boxes I got Leon üòÇ makes you think the old boxes couldn‚Äôt have Leon but it‚Äôs all luck ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
That's what I thought. Don't even wanna play a friendly match. Weak 
---
Not if you play bounty and are aggro af while you're dying more than your killing. I've seen those people get star player before 
---
Servers in Zimbabwe 
---
How raged the other guy is lol
---
How?????
---
When Mortis actually had a good 3D Model.
---
That's just going to make Brock and Piper kill everyone
---
calculate centripetal force on this spinny boi
---
Play in organized teams. Randoms never get the job done
---
Same with my primo, 400 to 340
---
That was a galaxy brain mindset, wtf, get rekt teamers.
---
Too much?
---
Please no. Just no. 
---
God damn a toxic comment section...
---
I dont have link but it was leaked with new mortis remodel that is right now in game 
---
That's odd, I get mostly throwers and Ricos 
---
I just played against you last night, first time we lost and second time we won haha. Jonnyboy‚Äôs mini acc? 
---
i lile how in the botton left corner the username is clear and somehow they messed up anyways
---
Not necessarily, by my point was that it would encourage people to get kills or something rather than the game‚Äôs objective.
---
Well it should be teamers.
---
They dominate bounty nevertheless 
---
Or you all stand in the same bush and strike. 300+ is rigged with Dynas and Morti. If you aren't one of these sworn enemies, pick a side...
---
hey Star Wars started off with a little wincest yknow 
---
Zero. Not opened a single legendary brawler yet.
---
Maybe you shouldn‚Äôt have spent all that money 
---
But why should I die
---
Ê≠ª
---
Look how they massacred my boy
---
I think the hat would kinda ruin his hair
---
ow wait i did post about that i totally forgot lol https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/acahho/remodel_concept_of_el_primo_from_4_months_ago_sry/
---
Lo s√© &lt;3
---
lol u call me trashy? better stfu üòÇ alright?
---
Exactly what I was going for 
---
Auto aim lol hit the box instead of the dyna
---
Using the exploit? Hope you get banned as soon as possible
---
enemies from everywhere
---
Idk
---
People keep saying things and I ask them to give me their user name and show me their skills, and they don't even reply. 4 people. 1 from my mis titled double post.
---
My point is, if you're 350 Or 500, simply not understanding the fact that I know people winning doing this exploit and it isn't fair to those people in the 250 range even. It's funny... But it's not a way to handle a game.
---
If a player closes the game, intentionally, it should count as an afk for a temporary ban. Not replaced with a bot, so when they log in before the (play again) thing, they get brawler trophies and can manage to not lose any. 
---
But the issue is what would you as the player who got ksed from would do? You are to weak and even if that shield stays up for a fraction of a second it might make the difference because some characters attack faster than the others. Suppose a basic Dynamike and Nita situation. Dynamike ksed from Nita and gets a shield Nita quickly spams all three attacks in the time it takes for Dynamike to finish/summon (though with summon she will probably get only one hit in). This means Nita was blocked from her damage and probably dies to Mike. 
---
Maybe they should go for some QoL changes on Crow then. i don't see why they would inherently make a badly graphical ability. They can also make it so landing on someone directly does no damage but provides him with some short immunity or enhanced poison damage. Or just make all blades land but that sounds broken. 
---
When you get spike to 600 &gt;
---
guess u're right ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 
---
Yes
---
Would buy
---
I thought that too but then I figured out that it would make Jessie attack the other brawlers
---
Tu tambi√©n eres espa√±ol? 
---
That's why Primo keeps wasting his super on my turret?
---
Also pennies attack hit the other Penny with all 3 coins
---
Just tap rapidly, it skips faster that way
---
That's called autofire
---
problem?
---
Yea
---
Woah I never noticed I though they were flames
---
What's a common? What's the difference between common and trophy road?
---
This idea was mentioned not so much ago but ignored, glad someone is mentioning it again. Hope they add it.
---
Og player
---
That was some OP moves, here‚Äôs an upvote. 
---
I'd want ur coins lol I'm broke
---
I found this guy when I was pushing trophs with low brawlers
---
So on a battle royale "free for all" game mode you expect there to like... Not be a lot of enemies around you?
---
There are arguments for teaming but this is not one of them lol. Your argument is basically "its too hard without teamers." 
---
No Brock hat tho
---
Just have ten different bralwer on one map
---
Sounds dumb no offense 
---
oof
