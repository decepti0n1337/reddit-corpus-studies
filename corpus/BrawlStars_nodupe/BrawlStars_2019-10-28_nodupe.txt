Mario Kart is p2w tho, but I play it too

I was upvote 1000
---
Hah, I don't care. This is my opinion. And yes I always hated his skins, because some of them are ridiculous but I liked only 0.1%. And yet it's my first time getting karma.
---
Supercell need to add it it's amazing
---
Hehe lets pretend we dont see that
---
But Mecha crow is a 300 original skin and 10k star points for black Mecha.
---

---
Dragon night Jessie can be bought for 69 gems and a 10k Star points for shadow knight.
---
Does not make sense for this to be 10k.
---
Oh, hahah. That's rly funny, that's what I meant, right? It's, like, no its not f'ing Graveyard Shift, it's Life Leech!!

Go bait some normies in Insta, Fake yt-er

Im just waiting for Piper tbh

That's Rick
---
The entire map is Tick
---
That is fair but I pushed mortis almost exclusively in brawl ball so just my opinion :)

A start of a new beautiful story^-^

Only with photoshop but it is so long if want i can make on of your but if you want, come in private msg

r/DarrylGang rise up!

---
Uhh.. don't need lvl 13 Shelly ult in my walk way.
---
What about pink piper and blue Tara what gem skins are they a copy of them
---
I‚Äôd argue that they don‚Äôt need nerfs, otherwise it would just be Crow and Tick
---
Beware: OP has never posted quality art like this in his profile before.  The picture is also weirdly cropped and low quality; may be stolen.

Is that poco brawl stars?

Yeah a little as pixelcrux ? But pixelcrux is so uncomfortable and I think the rendering is not great.

And also I only put 1 star power

You can't just compare a single characteristic and ignore everything else.

[Here's the float in news footage](https://youtu.be/TFU1iuLYiSg?t=2182). I love how it doesn't stand out at all in comparison to the other floats and performers.

Lmaooooo, good job hahaha

Not yet

It makes me cringe so much for some reason.

I cant tell if it's some sort of sick joke, but even so its still fucking weird

Thx

What happened to her neck lol

super does about 2900 healing.  3 attack is 2400 ,500 less.

What would you like to add?

It difficult to kill tick kill dyna
---
Whot the fack

Satisfying gotta save this.
---
Pretty sure if it wasn't Supercell, there would be no Brawl Stars up front.  They'll milk any possible opportunity for money.
---
There are still mechas that cost gems... like mecha bo is orange and mecha crow is blue
---
Hey. Who said that was your idea? Stop stealing my old concepts!
---
Yeah, like either of you would have come up with this joke.
---
Crow has 4 skins: White, phoenix, black and blue mecha.

The mecha skins are copies of gem skins, it‚Äôs just that when the update came out that the normal/gem mecha skins were spaced out for the month while the star point skins were out and ready to go

No. You didn't put it. I did.

I dont like when somebody just enter a round and then just type somewhere something like:

"Lol barley is fighting primo and barley died" or "METEOR DROPPED ON TICK WITH 23 POWER UPS 100% NOT LYING GO CHECK M8" or "TEAMERS PRIMOS JUMP INTO THE GAS HELPING YOU WIN 110% NOT LYING" sorry but every time i see posts like this i think like that
---
Thanks man!
---
I used Paint Tool Sai for it
---
Good Job
---
The wii music is playing in my head. Help
---
Thanks for that

I think in these types of post you should never write brawler name even 1 and if you want you can write like "throwers, shooters, fighters" that at least dont hurt eyes

She was auto aiming I think and because she had the ball it wasted her super on the ball and she started auto aiming to try and get the primo off her back. Honest mistake, I‚Äôve been in some close calls where auto aim screwed me by attacking a power cube box rather than the brawler that was rushing me and bam defeat. Definitely sux and it was stupid but it definitely wasn‚Äôt intentional and I feel like her team automatically assumed that and was pissed.

---
Boy if you're so triggered over a mobile game then you should take a break and go outside. And he is a kid, and his voicelines fit him very well. 
---
And why do you all love graveyard shift so much?? Its still RNG based like normal showdown. If you spawn near a piper when you play crow or spike, then your game is over. If you are in a place where no one is near, then you're as good as dead.
---
Marked as "Gaming"...
---
Yes
---
Yes me too
---
You're everywhere in controversial
---
Thanks
---
its a joke
---
I have both and I honestly think witch shelly beats star shelly. Her animation is just incredible, you can see the 5 blocks of goo she shoots out, you know exactly where to aim to get more blocks onto the enemy. If you don't know what I'm saying, Shelly's attack looks like it's alot of bullets, but it's split into 5 shells. Witch shelly lets you see these 5 shells, star shelly doesn't. I just can't tell you how much I absolutely adore witch shelly, the only time I ever spent real money on this game
---
Nice comeback clown

Did you design this? I don't know if this is a repost but I'll assume you drew this. It's absolutely fantastic :D Keep up the good work!!

Well this post is saying RARES  only
---
Yoda interviewed about his Ketamine addiction
---
Star Wars favourite Yoda has shocked the entire Star Wars community by admitting that he has been an intergalactic ketamine addict for the last forty years.
---
According to the little green man, he started using ketamine shortly after the first Star Wars movie, A New Hope, was released in 1977 and has struggled with addiction ever since.
---
‚ÄúAh yes, strung out am I,‚Äù he told Wunderground earlier. ‚ÄúFor many years, done Ketamine has Yoda. Forty years ago, a normal man Yoda was, six foot tall and normal colour skin had he. Then, one day, sniffed a fiesty one, did I. Forty years later, a green midget ketamine addict am I.‚Äù
---
Reports suggest that Star Wars writer and director George Lucas was aware of Yoda‚Äôs addiction but chose not to intervene as he felt it added depth to the character.
---
‚ÄúOh yeah, I knew about it from the very start,‚Äù Lucas told Wunderground. ‚ÄúNot a lot of people know this but Yoda was actually a guy from Nebraska named Vincent. He‚Äôs not even an alien, what you‚Äôre actually looking at is a man who has completely surrendered his mind and body to drugs.‚Äù
---
‚ÄúOriginally he was still quite tall, we used camera trickery and makeup to make him look small and green but he‚Äôs shrank at a rate of about one inch a year and gotten progressively greener,‚Äù continued Lucas. ‚ÄúHe used to be able to talk properly too but now he muddles his words up all of the time. If he wasn‚Äôt such a good character, it would be tragic, but hey ho, that‚Äôs Hollywood.‚Äù
---
‚ÄúEventually, if he keeps using ketamine, I believe he‚Äôll turn into a pea, which would actually work really well for another movie I‚Äôve been writing, Star Peas, it‚Äôs set in the same Universe as Star Wars but way into the future after a rogue band of vegetable farmers brought peace to the Galaxy,‚Äù revealed the director. ‚ÄúPlus, I pay him in ketamine so by the time he‚Äôs a pea I‚Äôll literally only have to give him about one gram every year, that‚Äôs cheap, even for washed up actors from the 70s.‚Äù
---
According to movie insiders, the original Star Wars cast was plagued with illness and addiction, including Chewbacca, who was suffering with a rare strain of throat cancer, all of the Ewoks, who were addicted to Brylcreem and Luke Skywalker who recently lost a hand to loom bands.
---
ohhhh sorry, I was thinking of when big game was called boss fight

What? That's so bullshit! He got so much upvotes because of this beautiful piece.

It's not sometimes true. It's like 80% true. Every single time, my teammate decides to hide with me till showdown, but they keep shooting revealing our position getting us a 5th place.
---
Lmao this post is going to blow up
---
Wtf rockabilly mortis???
---
i just have 1 suggestion to make it better, reduce the middle water cause it will make it hard to survive in the final showdown if you use brawlers like primo or rosa
---
I didn't notice that :)))

No! That's not how your supposed to play the game!

It isn't comparing to default shelly though, this post is comparing witch and star shelly. Any shelly skin is better than default shelly.. Heck I think any skin in general is better than no skin so..

The world finals pack (containing 12,000 coins, 12 mega boxes, and 150 gems) was disguised as a $10 brawl-O-ween pack

This is true

Dude they are siblings, and children at that. Stop pushing these gross ships
---
I am there, but not there for were wolf Leonüò≠ I have 86 gems
---
I meant that the shield appears when you attack other players, but it appears after your first hit. You still have a second so you will be able to do some damage.[sorry for my english]
---
Endless walking around and when you reach the other end of the level boss can't be attacked. Repeat.
---
I take a screenshot of the characters and draw over them on s note
---
Yup tick was my lowest brawler he was 12 rank and now hes 20
---
I would've bought it if the cat showed up in game.
---
Yeah. Only exclusive skin I got is the helper penny
---
He‚Äôs pretty ridiculous in my opinion, he‚Äôs actually the brawler I hate facing the most in Graveyard Shift.
---
if you don't have a decent team game will put you with -200 trophy masters at times just to make you loose. And then it will give you an easy win after you have lost x times.
---
i preffer adding kaboom canyon back
---
Players using  money are the ones making existence of this game possible. That is the fact, which everybody should realize.
---
If you like the game, and have the money, why not use it? There is nothing especially noble being f2p. The thing is, that most of the players are kids who usually don't have much money. That obviously makes some of them bitter, if not toxic when they can't buy stuff they want...

No one will guess what i will cosplay this year üôÉ
---
What brawler should I upgrade first??
---
It will be like
---
Whoa is big response time!
---
Says the guy that has a single post and that post is about brawlball. How many trophies do you even have?
---
Well, I prefer the first one. I will always use my fav brawl but if the random brawl is not usually for me to use, then it's useless.
---
@ the op then
---
There's always that one who thinks the game is P2W.
---
Hate the skin love the idea
---
I have a better idea! There is only one dashing assasin in the game, and EMZ has such a dashing look!
---
No you only say that to people you're familiar with, otherwise it would be kind of an insult, but if you know this person, then my bad, i didnt know
---
Wow. That‚Äôs one costly mistake. Hopefully support can help you out if you got overcharged!
---
bruh serenades are made by men
---
While yes, I do think this is a good idea, because after you‚Äôve upgraded every brawler fully, the next step is just to get skins. However, they‚Äôd need to be significantly marked up, like a thousand coins for 5 gems Would make much more sense, as you would have to remember that gems are the main source of revenue from a game that is free with no ads. And because of that it will never happen, but hey, nice idea anyways
---

So many people saying good job yada yada. There is no effort here at all?? Anyone can cut out barelys face with some cardboard and hold a wine bottle lmao. Weakkkk

You remind me of someone I ain't gonna say who tho
---
1. I'm not triggered, I'm just disappointed. Besides, I rarely play Leon, so I'm not bothered by it too much.
---
2. We all enjoy Graveyard Shift because some of us miss Life Leech, and some of us enjoy a new modifier to showdown every once in a while. Also, why do you assume that Crow or Spike can't dodge Piper's shots?
---
what a deal

I would guess they will Arrive this week, probably Thursday

But Piper isn't bad in brawl ball
---
Exactly my thoughts

This guy sucks dick for dimebags!

What the fuck am I looking at?

The thief had confessed he stole it a while ago, he said he just forgot about it

Is about that weird part of twitter where piper was a crossdressing guy and he was..... Lets say i have regrets

Okay im just saying that the multiple ones will do way more extra damage

About playing at big tablets.

Thanks for your art post! If you are not the creator of this work, please make sure that you have included the source, or to  comment it here! Unsourced art may be removed if you are not the creator.
---
You fooled me, I thought it was yours. Why do you do this?
---
Soo what the tablet is big so it's harder to play is that it because if it is that's pathetic learn to adapt
---
I swear, this mortis smile is not normal

Leon is overpowered
---
Yes I need it

I hate art thief‚Äôs

Well this map is pretty close so it will be a bit difficult
---
You stole this idea!!!
---
That's how I think it'll make the meta more diverse.

Removed - DO NOT SUBMIT POSTS WITH TITLES IN ALL CAPS. CAPS LOCK IS CRUISE CONTROL FOR COOL

Lovelly! I would give you some fancy wording  and a great pun, but i recently changed my flair so ill just say: Magnificent cosplay :)

Quadruple, thanks to the last Bo mine
---
Nah
---
 Not to be rude but the emz attack looks like a poop fart
---
I gave that bitch a peice of my mind
---
Ask the Spike
---
maybe they played together? reply if you played with pair. Then ye, if you played with pair it's matchmaking.
---
Barley is kinda good

Why are people still responding to this comment, this was 19 days ago...

What is cake day? Is it random or is it on your birthday?

There was a pause between "first" and "second" if we would of called that "quadruple" :).
---
Lel the original had no sound then I changed it to this with this sound effect
---
#ho ho ho
---
It's the day you joined reddit
---
Repost again, you‚Äôre losing your trust
---
I can tell just by the title its stolen. No one has ever made art and put "by me" in the title. I will report him
---
Ight imma head out
---
The Crow Gang strikes again
---
Yeah she is like those teenage girls today
---
First of all, you had a power advantage.
---
What gamemode btw
---
THATS A NEGATIVE ELIXIR TRADE
---
more so you games of my idea if you want support my idea put it in the club and send to supercell itself
---
basically island invasion 2
---
Idk, but im definantly in the top 1% (17.5k)
---
Lmao
---
Woah that's a lot of trophies!
---
8.5k no legendaries yet
---
√üruh
---
I think I got an idea 
---
Pause at a time so you can see what skin you got
---
That's going too far. His account needs to be banned/restricted at best.
---
Sounds like a 12 year old's kinda issue
---
Emz is like teenage girl so she should have brigade skins
---
He is taller now
---
And 3 star powers
---
Raccoon
---
repost
---
So, super gets charged in 3 basic attacks and when she has her super she just needs 1 more basic attack and She can use her super again, the only brawler that if She has all ammo charged with super, She can do super, basic attack, super, basic attack, super, basic attack and super against only One opponent, and if there are two, then Just super, super, super, super until they die, Is It enough or do I need to Say something else? (Btw no hate, Just telling you why I think she's OP)
---
12.5k and got spike
---
It doesn't look right since u recolored what r supposed to be pants as her actual legs ü§£
---
The prestige.
---
I think it looks pretty good! Great job!
---
I JUST HIT 11K TODAY AND I THOUGHT THERE WAS GONNA BE A MEGA BOX T-T
---
Or Rune
---
Something* lol
---
in a different way¬Ø \ _ („ÉÑ) _ / ¬Ø, this is the original model from the game
---
Well if u wanted a solution, delete the app data and sign into an alt's supercell ID. PS, u can't delete a notification
---
I dont usually play with sound :/
---
I wish I have extra life... have only the 1st star power for 8 bit which it sucks!
---
Why would you say something so controversial, yet so brave?
---
I remember a few weeks ago when i've seen this here, looks like insta normies stole it and then a reddit normie stole it back (that just shows how reddit is turning into such normie site)
---
I'm sorry I don't speak can't-shoot-over-walls
---
Nobody cares about the reason of your bad grammar, my advice is to NOT share this kind of things on the internet, we don't need that information.
---
Oh but I still just have crow. Hopefully I get something good out of the 12k mega box I just got 11.7k
---
When u see a mortis with coiled snake
---
What website is this?
---
I am not against that, all I am against is playing with clanmates 6000 trophies below you.
---
Also, Im at 12k so this was unfair matchmaking anyway.
---
Yes but her super is only charged with 3 attacks if they are up close, same thing about the 1 super and 1 attack thing.
---
Its really nice good job!
---
It is real
---
Its goood but one hour is so many. Come to me i teach u how to do that LOL
---
C‚Äôest vraiment une excellente id√©e
---
No its not the update for October just came out
---
gotem
---
I feel extremely threatened by this demonic creature supercell, please remove this it gives me nightmares and visions of hell itself.
---
Is the 8-bit hand???
---
Nice gl
---
Who said that? I swear food can't talk. I know it can't. Are the ghosts trying to haunt me now? Is my niece's constant blabbering starting to take over my brain? I must be spiraling!
---
There is no argument. They are both good options
---
Literally everyone, except new accounts which have a higher legendary drop, has the same problem. I was lucky enough to unlock Spike at 5k trophies, but I could say that I had grinded a lot that month to get there (June/July 2018 btw, beta phase). Don't worry too much about it. Keep playing, and you'll get one eventually. But tbh it's not gonna change much. You might be able to win easier trophies with it, but thats pretty much it.
---
Kinda late but at least you noticed it!
---
The problem is matchmaking. To fix that, you shpuld only be able to choose brawlers that are 50 above or below your teammate(s)'s trophy count.
---
Noice
---
AND NOW I HATE HOW I COMMENTED ON IT....
---
How many star powers do you have? I only have Shelly‚Äôs and there is only 4 hours till power play comes outüò≠
---
Leon is a chameleon...thats how he got his name ChameLEON.
---
Confirmed
---
Or anybody
---
Confirmed by devs
---
I already did skin on Pam
---
I have both of barleys and primos and hyper bear for Nita, and I am very close to bull power 9
---
Same meme can be done with brock, emz and jessie.
---
Ironic as "witches" were prosecuted by the Catholic Church in the middle ages.
---
Nice good lucküòÄ
---
Not if Tick has anything to say about it
---
Thx you too
---
‚†Ä
---
üëç
---
Congratulations
---
Yeah but that means that any brawler Will be doomed if She Is upclose, there must be at least One that can counter her upclose, even Leon can be defeated (by bull) upclose but shelly can't, only a piper with a super with good reflexes could survive
---
Bro its not though im at 13k and i go against those players all the time
---
Me but I got both poco‚Äô star power and it‚Äôs colt and primo
---
Jeeeeeealous!
---
Thx i understood but thx u for doing the effort
---
I totally agree, and not only that the value is amazing (shot animation, win loss animation, brawler model, and a black cat) but it's not like I'll have 80-150 gems any other day. I rarely buy gems (I've spent 20$ on brawl stars over the course of 2 years) and unless a save up a ton I wont have another chance to buy sakura or robo spike even though they're available full time. I'll probably still buy witch shelly though, so thanks.
---
i love that idea thx for sharing!
---
I want coffee emz
---
I feel like Loaded should be at the head of the table. 
---
In any case I don't want his stealth to be super relevant. Stealth is never healthy. I'd rather his stealth be weak, and he be compensated in other ways. 
---
Maybe his speed increase Star Power be made default and he gets a new one.
---
U're welcome !
---
r/engrish
---
His star power is SO BROKEN
---
I‚Äôd say spike. His star powers are more influential on a game to game basis and really take him to a new tier of threatening
---
Hi I'm that spike with 0 power cubes and a power drink who murdered u :D
---
I‚Äôm not sure how far you‚Äôve progressed in the game or how much you play, but I‚Äôm a maxed player who plays about an hour a day and let me tell you, once you max out, you earn gems a lot quicker. I‚Äôm also F2P so don‚Äôt fret about not having that many gems again as long as you save up and not spend them on other purchases
---
I think it‚Äôll cost at least 5000 star points ( if it were to be added to the game ) considering the price of calavera piper
---
r/MissedTheS
---
AND then you just see rockabilly Mortis smiling in the background üòÇ!
---
Feels bad
---
Yeah it' s not like cus of long range Maps heist became the less played mod, at least before well... Siege happened
---
I‚Äôm so happy
---
Same
---
Lol thanks. I actually laugh wether i face boss gene or when i get to be boss gene
---
Poor spikey boi got spooked ;w;
---
4416 out of the highest number you can count to!
---
but does she have a hydro flask?
---
Just Shelly living her best life
---
It sounds like the future
---
S t o I n k s
---
wow thats amazing!
---
On an aesthetic perspective, it looks amazing! However, I think people may be pissed about how open it is because of the huge number of open maps in brawl stars. I also think that the main issue for this will be late game when the gas closes in, as there is no way for close range brawlers to have a fair fight, perhaps add a little platform in mid for the brawlers to fight on?
