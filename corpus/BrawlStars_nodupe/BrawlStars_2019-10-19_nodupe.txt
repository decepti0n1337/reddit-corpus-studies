Damn whats ur trophy im at 15k missin sandy

Leon's old star power is so good for this

well compared to the shitty memes on this subreddit , you actually need brain cells to come up with something like this. respect to OP

WHOS COMING!

they are not supposed to know that

Why do I get pelted with downvotes

**gets reported by a ton of people**
---
Oh wait what have I done ITS MORTIS MONTH RUN MY FELLOW DYNAS
---
Lol
---
Oh goddamn it not the brawlstars cactus
---
What do you mean organized teaming?
---
Eh, leave zombies to frank. Leon could be a ghost
---
Or was that your boyfriend? The one you were arguing with against me on r/shittybrawlstars?
---
Well yes but actually no
---
Wow didn't notice that
---
Ah so Samantha is controlling zombie Leon (only real gamers will understand)
---
This was actually teased in the retropolis teaser because in the background there was a mortuary
---
Is that a bald spot on his back
---
I like the frank edit it's like regi from Nintendo edited to regi-gigas
---
Not because it sounds that way. Because it‚Äôs literally the feminism version of the noun in Spanish.
---
Oh! Awesome! Wish I got some 8 boy power points.
---
Lies, deception.  Too much blue.
---
Well played :)
---
Nice
---
Thanks!!
---
That still sounds like communism man, you sure you understand what we‚Äôre talking about?
---
Oh so creative i love it
---
Dash and be trash
---
oof
---
Mortis is very fun to play,and if you know how to play him,you could destroy your enemies.Anyways,he is very hard to play too,so many people don't know how to play with Mortis (sorry if my english is wrong,it is not my original language)
---
It was time for leon to go. He had seen enough.
---
Nope give me attention because that‚Äôs what I ‚Äúwant‚Äù
---
I think there is also the idea that Mortis can just run off and do whatever he wants. Other brawlers have to make space but Mortis is fast so that becomes a thing. Just theorizing
---
Yeah I always thought it was sup erc ell ngl
---
Pls comment down below and let me know what u think
---
At least I'm not you too. I'd rather become a nice, civilised person, who is somewhat likeable than be a toxic asshole.
---
Photoshop.. It's a good painting / drawing program
---
UPDATE: they chabged it again to "fansstarss"
---
btw what do you report them as? I will also tweet until this account gets enough reports to be removed.
---
I just played with ramdoms for 2 months and i lost 1004 trophies and played with my friends and finnaly recover it
---
You're pretty known in the community for your art. Its actually pretty good art
---
Mortis ia balanced wdym?
---
That was not the answer i was expecting but that is actually really clever!
---
I'm just saying Leon isn't OP
---
I dont think so as it was only for the end of summer
---
Fansstarss is not banned yet
---
I love this people. I bet they all have Sandy and now they are defending him and acting like he isn't OP.
---
I have him and I managed to reach 500 trophies with no trouble at all and I have him at level 2. 
---
His super is extremely OP and lets not forget that he has a super boost that gives his tornado ability to take your hp while you are in it. He is most definitely OP...
---
But it has 0 followers, 0 following, 0 posts. So yea.
---
Until you see them teaming in duos
---
I Like that, Mike definitively needs more skins
---
I haven‚Äôt seen anyone post the video yet so I wanted to share it with you guys. It kinda is free upvotes tho.
---
11
---
Well really the probability of drawing a legendary is based on luck, I'm at 11K+, been playing since global, and I have all brawlers except for 2 legendaries - Crow &amp; Sandy. So you just gotta get lucky to pull one from a box.
---
I just wanted to share it with you guys since I haven‚Äôt seen anyone else post the video. It is free upvotes, I just don‚Äôt care about the karma points-
---
Thanks fore the critisiaom do you want to remake it
---
Why did you don't try to remake this?
---
Haha nice
---
Hmm... I just checked the account and it still has 1601 posts, 40.9K followers and 3 following... I don't think he's banned yet
---
I upvoted my then I noticed it was at 70 upvotes. I did what needed to be done. You‚Äôre welcome america
---
Not to mention everyone hunting you for powercubes.. 
---
# UGH
---
The reason there aren‚Äôt as many upvotes is bc ppl didn‚Äôt notice it :)
---
My guess? Supercell was classifying brawlers by speed class. Assasins are all the fastest walkers, heavyweights the second fastest, and everyone else is the slowest. The only two exceptions to this rule are 8-bit and Sandy.
---
i don't know why they do that btw the mode i made has no powercubes so people should focus on killing robots instead of killing eachother for the powercubes
---
If they were also on 790 with a power 3 brawler, while you are on 790 with a power 10 brawler, then you were the noob
---
Noob means new dipshit. They didn‚Äôt have more than 150 trophies
---
1 minuto a√≠ e se ele atirar leg 0-0 ,run for your life becase os coming for uor

This make any Sense
---
That‚Äôs why I was like how‚Äôd you win?
---
There is still one in his mouth
---
Ah ok, that should help then. Have an upvote
---
[removed]
---
Several times today I was on my 10k mini and this happens and I was using power nine Pam in gem grab, frank in bb, and etc. Meta choices and some of them were hard carries too lol
---
we brawl it, we talk it, 7rings
---
Bull is the big brother training little brother Mortis to fight teamers
---
Go away lol
---
looks amazing
---
Well, then it wasn't the fault of the matchmaking, you can't get matched with really low people, they MUST have been in a team with the other high trophy guy, so the problem are just higher trophy people playing with low trophy friends and ruining it for others, but supercell can't do anything about it, or should they make a rule that high trophy people can't play with their friends anymore if they don't have enough trophies?
---
Oof
---
How
---
Im so sorry fore you
---
I love rush wars
---
Ive been having so much fun as fun as brawl stars rn
---
ya but im struggling to keep 1 alive
---
It doesn't you get less boxes in the long run big boxes are a box for 10 gems and megas are a box per 8 with doublers being a box per 5
---
No it‚Äôs a matchmaking issue that‚Äôs the point of his post. Supercell can fix it it‚Äôs a bug I was at 790 teammates weren‚Äôt above 150 their team was all at around 550+. How is that fair I was basically 1 v 3
---
Cool i like it
---
What does that have to do with anything?
---
YES! YES! YES! YES! YES! YES!
---
I do hab to disagree though.
---
Hear me out:
---
If we compare two players with the same brawlers at the same thropy range for each brawler one of them is f2p and has most brawlers at level 5-6 some at the higher levels too of course. And the other has only brawlers with star powers. Then the f2p would have reached the same amounts of throphies as the one who already maxed out his brawlers and got that sweet bonus from the star powers. Which are pretty significant. Just think about Shelly vs Shelly with the old Band-aid.
---
Then again after a certain time/throphy amount the difference disappears because even f2p get star powers at the end.
---
Lol u were absolutely correct. He is playing mortis! I just remembered your comment after seeing his postüòÖ
---
A total disgrace to r/mortisgang
---
Its always like that i dont expect to get a legendary at 10k only at 13k 14k and all the 2ks get the freaking legaendaries
---
That‚Äôs basically robo rumble with a Halloween map skin

Stolen, please guge credit next time scum
---
deletus their fetuses
---
Get out
---
Well ya know, Mortis is known for stealing...
---
But if we also consider the fact that I (for example) was f2p and played 3 hours a day (on average) while you were p2w (for example) and played 1 hour a day (on average). Since the brawlstars ladder system prefers grinding over skill, in your circumstance, we could be equally skilled. 
---
You are also stating that for someone to be p2w they must have star powers/ max resources. What if I only spent a few dollars on a power point pack here and there? That still counts as a paid player, but their brawler levels would be very similar to someone who had spent no money on the game and played for the same period of time.
---
Definitely Ryan

at the very least your watermark is still there, if the gunna post your crap they should at least link your reddit account so people can find the Artist, at the very least they should disclaim it's not their art and their just sharing something the thought looked cool, but then why not link the artist.

You can see the code in the image and his youtube channel is : https://m.youtube.com/channel/UCyhQyeUjSzkb2CFW3uDmeEQ
---
Wait, i cant see it
---
Wait, thats illegal
---
f2p playes are more patient and i guess spend money smarter
---
At first I thought this vid was about popcorn rico.
---
The down side is he stops (like frank) and takes time to land his attack (like bibi and frank) and has small range (like bibi) so there will be enough time to escape from his attack (it works for frank and he is as fast as bull and more tankier than bull) and he yes he is as fast as crow but he got a bigger hit box so he cant dodge as much as crow and again he stops to attack so you can escape from him and he can't chase you as much a crow
---
It sounds OP when you just only compare his positives without considering his negatives
---
The speed is mandatory because without it, it will be too easy to get out of his range while he stops to perfom his attack and he won't even be as successful as frank in landing hits since his range is way smaller than frank and the reason for the HP is the same reason why every melee brawler has high HP that is we have to get near to a bralwer without dying 
---
And even if he's still sounds OP to you we can always balance him out
---
XD I like this improvise

check the end of the video again

Mortis is better with hat

Two things i can say about that

1- Pipers new skin

2-Pam new remodel

3-Or new brawler (not sure)

Very stonks.

Yde .....are u ready for new mortis skin !?
---
We got Lone stars and takedown at the last one... not so bad !
---
you can try Google rewards but it gives very low amount
---
The next brawler will be mortis without hat for sure
---
The situation between mortis and frank is basicaly like between soldier and merasmus in tf2

Or maybe Mermaidman..?

Too big

i'm iranian btw and i visit the sub every 2 to 3 hours to check my posts
---
Replace bibi with Pam and shocky with energize and you got it right.
---
Maybe a new fish-like brawler. Would be amazing
---
Why ?
---
By opening boxes such as normal, big, and mega boxes you have a chance of getting some gems. 
---
Another way of getting gems is by purchasing them.
---
There is a third way. Supercell can give you gems if you have a creator code.
---
Considering your brawler flair I thought you were gonna just smash this post with a hammer......
---
Thanks you
---
you have to open boxes to get brawlers. you can gain trophies quickly but it doesn't mean that you also opened boxes
---
You forget the strange brawlers
---
Okay but those spikes in dropping would make me uncomfortable.
---
Where did you see this ?
---
Whats this
---
Exams.
---
The goal is really to keep Tara's shadow close to the safe and keep it alive. It has extremely good focus healing over time. You can tank some shots to keep it up longer. Reposition the AI by purposefully taking damage.
---
Turrets/Deployables are recommended but not necessary for 5+ minutes

OH MY GOD IM DYING

The gooses can be the new brawlers super maybe a new spawner
---
Thats gene!!
---
Well, height too, they can change it with the skin. Don‚Äôt you remember that robot dynamike skin? And you can‚Äôt just see a video, see a brawler far away and think it is smaller than other.
---
About the eye, you are really right, it‚Äôs missing an eye.

Wow, I just played you. GG you are a good mort :)

This hapens to me sometimes and i have a big phone but its funny

Bottom Left one is obviously Gene and right one might be a Mummy Tara skin but idk it doesnt has the top eye
---
Ok the title was stupid but when i posted the video have been out for 18m

And your comment TOXIC% 50

oof rip, i‚Äôm 14k with 24 brawlers, lets hope we get a brawler soon or the new mythic :)

The food comes unpeeled.

Not that good and so low effort maybe an image or a text
---
Zoom in on his shoulder if you want...
---
Bruh my comment ain‚Äôt toxic. You should probably know that everyone overanalyses everything put out by the yt channel.
---
If you‚Äôre ever more than Pam‚Äôs turret away from the safe, you‚Äôre doing it wrong. There are minor exceptions to this, but for the most part you need to stick near the safe. The only major exception is when the boss spawns. You always go find the boss.
---
Penny just use fool‚Äôs gold
---
And both of her eyes are revelead. Probably a new brawler
---
but maybe its a new brawler that spawns ducks üòÇüòÇ

I don't see how this means addiction. Brawl Stars is a game that actually deserves most dedication to it, seen how actually fun it is compared to the 99% of mobile games that are pure garbage
---
Lol getting star tokens isn't hard

I wanted to say joe but its been done ;-;

hmm

Then, if it has to be a new Brawler, I hope they make it original.

So I guess my fanart is ABSOLUTELY not canon then.... ._.

New environment mortis mortuary

i don't think it's a new tara skin, cause they showed iris tara in the mortis house

I love it but you are spamming, so take my downvote

Piper skin

I posted this way before there were a lot of these. I don't know your logic of time, but I think you need to use your common sense; The official YouTube channel of Brawl Stars posted a new video, and of course everybody is hyped about it. Heck, even YouTubers have already speculated about the new update and when and what will come with it. It's complete human nature to be excited about this. So just ignore the posts, and if you still find the Subreddit flooded with this "plague" just get off reddit, and do something more productive. Say... maybe some Brawl Ball? Or maybe just take a nap haha.
---
is it just me or tick is hilarous af.
---
New brawler
---
No it means Yde is getting remodel, skin, and nerf because he is OP

Roommate =/= couple

Why arab?

Meanwhile I‚Äôm just trying to get mortis

damn boy, that Primo is way 2 good

Im glad you like it

did u watch the video till the end? it literally says "brawl talk tomorrow" at the end of the video smh...

And how should I remove it!?

Ha, I get it! Because Mortis counters Dynamike. Comedy XD

at least make it look like you made the art alright?don't steal if you don't even know how to edit

Oh

It literally has his watermark right there

That's a new skin for mortis look at his eyes

Sorry, i from Russia, my English no good, maybe i took some mistakes to my text

Yes, maybe he just started playing brawl stars

New brawler?!

Hi
---
Imagine it with a top hat
---
Why everyone is pointing at the newspaper that says brawl talk. They said "brawl talk tomorrow" at the end of the video its already confirmed.
---
Too many people are posting this.this most likely is a piper skin
---
Is that from luner new year i think it mite be
---
That second one looks like gene but the first one looks new tho
---
Honestly tho
---
At 0:20 behind the tree over the right side

You might be right, maybe it's a Chinese year or just an Arab character

UNDERTALE?? IS THAT ASGORE‚ÄôS EYES?? (I know it isn‚Äôt because he used orange and blue but this one also has the same animation, just closer up and different colors.)
---
I think a skin for gene maybe?
---
thanks btw i will not get the new possible mythic brawler now :/
---
Ummm...why?
---
Gene skin confirmed!!?
---
The last one was an accident
---
\#you have provoked a gang war
---
Cool tier list except that Shelly just rob banks u know she's a bandita, and Bo is KFC manager and u misspelled sheriff, still upvoted tho
---
I think it might be gene
---
okok but serious guys, hat or no hat?
---
u/RadY3ro that's probably what the thing you saw is, a hint at the next environment
---
Yeah I need to mention that. His art style is somehow became a little closer to mine.. haha
---
right.. its right, not rite
---
I saw the hint on the YouTube channel and remembered the legend of the headless knight :P
---
Don't worry, she just wants your candy...
---
So that she can start a plague through those candies kids will eats them

The one under the dock has got to be Gene.
---
Look at the colt btw
---
isn't mortis a mortitian/mortician/potato?
---
the new brawler has pupils tho she was just looking to the left in the video
---
I think is is my new favorite. Great job as always!
---
Yes
---
Boku no

Someone who actually has worth in this world. Someone who actually matters to people.

Someone, who is not you.

Kid, you don‚Äôt want to do this
---
It's true: all of the assasins have the same speed (Exept darryl, who isn't technichally an assasin, but the community generally considers him one).
---
This isn‚Äôt what the sub is for
---
For pic no.6
---
Its not biome its themed area pleas we are not in Minecraft
---
I never coment, but this... Is fucking fabolous, the best halloweens skin
---
I love this!! If you do more, I would love to see them too!
---
Dead piper maybe? So now piper can crush on poco....oh god...
---
Yeah kidoo you're going to r/iamverybadass . May the council decide your fate.

Dang it

My mistake, I wrote a comment that rewords what is written in the image.
---
Well it's related to brawlstars, excuse me if it doesn't meet the requirements, I did not know.
---
its piper this girl has the same umbrella as piper so its a piper skin
---
10 year old me would understand
---
I‚Äôm not 10 as of now
---
Same
---
This looks amazing
---
No problem and true lol

Their is another

Maybe mummy tara

Dude you‚Äôre awesome

Do it, I‚Äôm getting really tired talking to a moron. You think some redditors‚Äô opinions on that sub are worth to me? I‚Äôm going to stop because I don‚Äôt want to be banned again.

I have lost my brain cells taking to you. You‚Äôre a mistake and you‚Äôre nothing to me. I don‚Äôt care about this ‚Äúcouncil‚Äù. I never said I was badass, I‚Äôm not even trying to be one. I can‚Äôt understand how you call me kiddo when you have the mentality of a 7 year old.
---
and his first meme is an horrible meme
---
Appreciations mate
---
It puts you in the same brawler trophy range
---
New skin for gene and tara
---
Im a creature of the night!
---
What game mode did you frequent?
---
INTO THE FIRE
---
Maybe he‚Äôll get a decent buff this time.
---
this post has been approved by plague itself
---
Skins
---
Of Tara and leon
---
I have all Mortis skins but not one of them is good in my opinion lol
---
 Or they replace No Hat Mortis with this one. (Top Hat Mortis ‚Äî&gt; Mortis)
---
yeah, really really amazing
---
this has a lot of visual pollution
---
That would be really cool
---
The new brawler will be something that spawns ghost ducks
---
Ima bout to use the tara and sandy one
---
It's ol' Greg
---
Cheers
---
I don't think so
---
First things first : *talking
---
Second : Dude you are so funny and I literally can't stop laughing. No one could make you lose something you don't have, I know you're upset cause you can't do anything to look like you're a big deal, but at least try posting comments so people will actually start like you. Good night.
---
Thanks, someone with a brain to realize that this kid is stupid. It‚Äôs like he‚Äôs expecting a prize because of this.
---
Cactus green!
---
I decieded to repost a modified version of the meme that i uploaded some hours ago, i think this one is better
---
DynaMikayla?
---
GET OUT OF MY SWAMP
---
I like him with the hat, but I they are both good.
---
Why is Brock a gangster?
---
We got tara and pam in the same update and frank and penny in the same update
---
maybe piper muerte
---
Morits now every think a bout the new update
---
I have no idea what of them is skin what brawler.
---
VAs don't go back to voice in animations sadly (apart from the old Brawl Stars ad one)
---
why would they put tara 2 times while there is only one of each brawler in the video?
---
Exactly. Frank is useless in anything other than brawl ball because lets face it, him having to stop during an attack is a huge downside. maybe buff his damage, or make him faster.

Its your connection

I think 1 is a Gene skin?
---
Ok üòÄ i Just try to dont let this subreddit be like instagram with One people doing something and 100 reposting
---
There‚Äôs no need to look closely it‚Äôs pretty obvious
---
You know. I just noticed the thing under the bridge is a gene skin.
---
ohh you¬¥re so unlucky
---
I know that is already done but I posted it before viewing the over posts. Sorry.
---
Frank is just mad for not getting anything new

If i see the creature of the night i updoot

The thing on the boat motor is a hand, and then i looked at it again later, and it is üëå. Like wtf brawl stars, why you gotta do me like that?
---
Ye.Forgot to mention that
---
Happens to me all the time. For some reason, on ticket events I often get matched with people at 2k-5k (while I'm at 15k) who pick the wrong brawlers for the mode. Plenty of Poco, Mortis, Piper, Gene, Frank... That's why I NEVER bet more than 5 tickets with randoms, because 9/10 times that's what happens and I don't want them to go to waste.
---
One: I‚Äôm not talking about her third eye, I‚Äôm talking about the one that‚Äôs under her shawl- not that you would know what a shawl is
---
Two: the ‚Äòdesigned‚Äô eye is clearly moving around and is most likely the thing making sounds in Tara‚Äôs ‚Äòvoice lines‚Äô
---
that was not even you, you were spectating them
---
It‚Äôs already done ‚Ä¶ but I‚Äôll give you my upvote !!
---
I think this is the New year event.
---
Bruh it's piper
---
**THIS CANNOT BE!**
---
yeah and she was wearing the iris skin
---
If you wanna max your brawlers fast !!
---
And????
---
That Is not Iris Tara skin
---
Dynamike is probably celebrating that mortis got crushed by franks hammer
---
that for left is hot
---
Way cool
---
You dont know that. It looks like a tara skin to me
---
I think it's Gene
---
Your ABLAHBLAHBLAH, hand them over.
---
Maybe i redraw this into more cool?

(Credits will be)

this is called replay mode

Okay!

Where did u found that??

New skin for Dynamike CONFIRMED

Might be the new brawler.
---
Shelly is a he

Thx

To me it looks like some kind of ninja
---
Mockey lmao
---
IT‚ÄôS JOHN CENA!!!
---
Awww man Gedi-Kor ur the god of the skins like ur skins are much and much better than original ones
---
xDDDD well that's confirmed now
---
shut up Wesley
---
This is a glorified splash map
---
Now thats a premium skin
---
9/10 , mortis hat missing :(
---
I don‚Äôt see the first one
---
##Say hi to me.bat
---
*gemmers not pros
---
Brock and Ball torture 
---
from wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.
---
Yeah, he has bats. Those bats drain the opponents‚Äô health and instantly transport that health back to Mortis, as if they have some sort of magical link.
---
Also, he looks vampire-y. That doesn‚Äôt mean anything but it sure is another indicstor that Mortis is a vampire.
---
Gene is not a pirate
---
Natheng is their 
---
Ha pls see what you are dweing
---
Okay okay ... pls see this okay ....! Bye bye
---
Yeah I‚Äôm really struggling to see what‚Äôs happening in the pic... is it a headless knight that‚Äôs holding his head against his torso with... a sword? 
---
Kinda confusing
---
The joke is everyone says every little detail even if it isn't important
---
Im more afraid of Pepe Gedi-kor
---
IDK , I like both
---
Looks like mummy tara
---
Another skin for gene? Or new brawler?
---
Which time zone tho
---
huefel also smells like updog
---
shelly said trans rights
---
It‚Äôs probably the other way around
---
El primo is Mexican not Spanish but ok. Also as a Spanish I don't support "Toro". Anyways it's a nice skin idea
---
Actually, rage in increases damage and movement speed but not attack speed. Same for haste. In cr, they should just buff move speed and dmg but not hitspeed, which would be more balanced than the current. Still dps buff, but not as broken
---
Yes. Maybe it's Helsinki time.
---
I didnt know that because I didnt get any of my brawlers at 650 so I made a guess.
---
Darryl looks really epic
---
But everytime i get maxed pam or jessie , i came to a stage that i want to play with randoms
---
CAAAAAEEEEEEEESAAAAAAAR
---
mortis eats dynamike. thats the joke
---
I got downvotes for making a joke let‚Äôs go gamers
---
Mortis parents
---
No shelly is a bandit remember?
---
Shelly's face
---
Im dying lmao XD
---
I actually thought of putting her there but it didn't look fitting
---
WTH
---
What's the joke?
---
got spike right before the new brawler gets released rip my legendary chances
---
oh my god its –∞ really hot
---
üò•üò•üò•üò•
---
Welp apparently according to a painting in the background, Frank has parents lol
---
Leave him be, I'm pretty sure he's not a native English speaker.
---
the brawl stars cactus proceeds to change form
---
I also push in solos but they probs also only pushed up to there crap rank in solos and surely u should know how to play a brawler in different gamemodes!!!
---

how did u calculate the probability of 80%?
---
WANTED GEDI-KOR WTF
---
you guys going to pen and trade ?
---
Maybe it's just pirate gene
---
i now, but dis is not the rite moment to juge
---
Why, she is one of the best characters
---
Quite kid next day: so anyways I started blasting
---
Its jean
---
i think the new brawler is a mummy girl and i think she will has some sort of pulling mechanic like gene
---
NOOOOO! PLEASE!
---
But he needs a nerf, they overbuffed him.
---
Ah yes sharing is CARƒ∞NG
---
I,m Russian, bro!
---
I think the one in the swamp is Gene, dunno y
---
This looks well made, 8.5/10
---
Listen here, you little shit
---
It's not your meme
---
I thought that it could be a skin cause these sticks really looks like he's dynamite
---
Looks like a new brawler. It may also just be a skin. That lake monster under the dock in that same may also be a skin, or a new brawler.
---
Nvm heavy, im heading out.
---
She is so sinister i love it.
---
Im at 9k without even a mythic or all epics ;(
---
Okay sign
---
okej wen aj ≈Çont gug
---
Stolen
---
Yeah, it is. Since I hit 3k to now, I didn't get a single new brawler, while my friend got all epics and he also got Spike at 2k ***:(***
---
Me too. No legandary. I‚Äôm at 10.4k now. Wanna be friends
---
*There
---
How long does it take you to get 1K trophies?
---
Shelly is broken. Think about that before you E EC *him*
---
iris tara was in the video
---
Are you in an inactive club?
---
He **stoke** it

barryl
---
All you do is steal memes
---
I just joined one of my friends clan that he just made. Already got 40k I think total in clan
---
lol imagine a ghost duck attacking you from nowhere
---
Hi Dad, I'm speechless.
---
But its FUNNY!
---
E
---
Cram skin
---
40k club trophies?
---
ƒ∞t so CUTEEEEE AH
---
Most people seem to be saying Gene. I'd be inclined to tell you it's a Penny Skin. Unless it's a new brawler, in which case, a lake monster brawler would be awesome as hell.
---
This is must be a mosque
---
Yea
---
TF2 classes have bajilion voicelines and i love it.
---
it's beesniper
---
Big nose? Are you referring to the fish lips?
---
guys it's not mummy tara cause tara was in the video with her iris skin
---
Mine is 97275 but here is my friend request :

---
How you look like after you miss all 3 shots in close fight
---
1k? I dont think so
---
What is that supposed to mean
---
Al right.
---
Mortis says he‚Äôs immortal in his death line, and it was 100% deserved
---
I got the joke but you know I had to do it.
---
Rosa and El primo: Are we a joke to you?
---
I did think of this when making the image, though I didn‚Äôt include it because it‚Äôs just speculation.
---
That s the ironic part
---
Full random, ≈ëket dobta be a rendszer. Lehet hogy bar√°tok, de az nem v√°ltoztat a t√©nyen, hogy egy 700 tr√≥fe√°s j√°t√©kos j√°t√©ktapasztalata sehol sincs a m√°sik h√°rom√©hoz k√©pest... √âs az igen is sz√°m√≠t! M√©g a 8000 tr√≥fe√°s j√°t√©kos is 140 szintes profillal j√°tszik, ami azt jelenti, hogy sokat j√°tszott de nem annyira √ºgyes, azzal nincs is gond.

A M E R I C A
---
Ok. I know the satisfaction
---
Oh... New brawler? Or New Skin?
---
Everyone talks about how many skins has brock
---
Barley: i am a joke to you
---
Very weird
---
Just because it's a troll doesn't mean it's good. Sometimes a bad troll is worse than the real thing.
---
This however is a very good troll. A real beacon of an example.
---
Yooooo that's sick

PregoüòÑ

Wow!!

Thanks for all your input! I fixed the image, should I repost the fixed one and delete this one?

Gucci smart toilet
---

---
Amazing skin idea!
---
You will suffer the wrath of my cringe AND YOUR SOULS WILL BE IN MY PICKLE JAR!!!
---
New brawler?
---
Really should be crow
---
Whats the name of the app?
---
I viewed his profile its stolen
---
NICE
---
Did you hear about season reset? :D I was over 650 with Dyna, I started to push him back just now.  
---
But the fact that the 3 enemy has way more game experience than my 2 teammates, that's not fair for noone.  
---
Even the 8k player was on 140lvl profile, that means he already played a lot, just wasn't so skillful and these types of player are better.  
---
The 2 players with me were newbies/beginners and they were matched against 17k+ and 10k plus players.  
---
For them (even they had 1-1 brawler over 600) is it even fair? (And now I ask for them, not for me)
---
Beautiful
---
YOU WILL SUFFER WRATH OF MY CRINGE AND SUFFER BENEATH THE WEIGHT OF MY BIG BRAIN
---
Yeah I understand, but it is possible
---
I have just zoomed SUPER close to the YDE/YOU it says YDE its confirmed guys :(
---
You know They had to do it to us
---
Too scary for brawl stars but still amazing work
---
No hat for me but hat looks good too üé©
---
Pls downvote guys cause its stolen
---
Spike is raping assasin
---
You when at a party: (Dynamike)
---
Stop. This isn‚Äôt even something ‚Äúnext level‚Äù worthy. You‚Äôre just spamming your subreddit on random posts
---
Its stolen dowmvote he lies look in his profile
---
If total trophies would could, how could 14k player fare with freshly unlocked lvl 1 brawler then?
---
and what you want
---
Hmm right
---
MY MAN TRUMAN LMAOOO
---
Bruh the Bibi fanart has a NSFW version I suggest not looking 4 it
---
Is barley,because on the scene of that winged man you can hear barley voice
---
I don't know why no one likes playing Frank but anyways, I destroy every player in Showdown
---
especially in Duo Showdown he is very strong but no OP.
---
Brawltalk? üòèüî´
---
no its not idiot im not falling for it
---
It‚Äôs nice to see that there are brawl stars and deltarune fans except me
---

adding a report button is a risky choice cause you may get reported by some players for no reason

Why post something this inane.
---
Piper se murio a la verja
---
oh shit my whatsapp is showing

Good
---
I love your teammate Primo..
---
He like "Well done mate.. Let me take the ball and score a goal" :D
---
its Gene I guess
---
Is because for Mortis eat he
---
Where you seen that?
---
Me to my friend: eyy I got a legendary at 1500 trophies

I pushed my Leon to 1k last season so I know how hard it is. Mad respect for anyone who can push to level 30.

It‚Äôs a gene skin
---
who's the starter brawler

Is this a old picture? Because there is old el rey primo

We need to take him to gedi-kor
---
A screenshot from reddit
---
Im shocked how this still not in the game
---
Lmao
---
But why?
---
I smell a new barley skin
---
THIS IS TRUE, WILL HAVE UPDATE SO ... BECAUSE IN THE LAST TEASER OF RETROPOLIS UPDATE THE MORTTIS MORTUARY WAS HIDDEN (AWAY) AS IN THE IMAGE YOU
---
Which time zone?

*YES*
---
Also notice how there‚Äôs an umbrella
---
oh no that gene...

that's my friend IRl O\_O

Haha yep! Enjoyed every moment of that match :D

But look, the clock in the mortuary is pointing at 10 or 11 (idk) but everything came at 10:00 cet.

Lol. That's why you keep your device safe from others
---
I already have 10.5k. No legandary. Sucks
---
A better question would be how many times are we gonna see this stuff over and over on this subreddit? With every post, this topic becomes less and less interesting. So please for the sake of Brawl Stars, look before u post
---
If I remember right last update Paul (game artist) mentioned something about a ninja brawler, could be that. Plus with Tara in the game a mummy would make no sense to add (already is a mummy, or can easily be given a full out mummy skin)
---
Very fancy, 10 pooped bombes out of 10
---
I just love the wanted poster
---
I got Leon at 12k. Haven't got even a single SP since last month. Patience...
---
I just got spike
---
A gene skin
---
Popo means butt in Turkish tho.
---
I try but then my cousin at 3k keeps flexing all his legendarys lmao.
---
Some people like you make jokes about this but in my home we argue about this at the family dinner and it's not fun
---
Same I beat him once in lone star  but 2 other times I got destroyed in brawl ball
---
r/thisisnotbrawlstars
---
Dude, my mom started playing last month. She has crow and she's not even 4k
---
Do you understand that higher rarity is not supposed to mean better or any kind of overpowered brawler, but more unique instead.
---
Have fun with it. Is an hard brawler to use but a very strong one. Also... congrats!
---
U shouldn't have made that choice ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø That's on u
---
im talking about this sub, you have a problem?
---
Have my upvote, hope this gets in hot
---
f
---
See im pretty goodluck
---
In brawl ball
---
I got shocked
---
I hope they replace it with a better Star Power
---
Bro I don't even play BS but love your fan arts and outfits for the characters
---
Gene is more fun
---
Sherriff?
---
I don't use a shitty phone, idiot. It's their horrible servers.
---
sheriff
---
: D
---
And this is why I have an alt account.
---
Its mummy poco guys
---
Damn 30k that's a little over 1000 on every brawler
---
No not at all, he has the most heath, one of the faster charges for his super and regular shot, incredible super that can indefinitely  stun, his regular shot is similar to Pocos but does nearly double the damage, not to mention his star power that makes his regular shot almost triple pocos damge. But yah let‚Äôs buff frank because he can‚Äôt move much
---
I opened 7 boxes and got tara and sandy  i got so lucky, and dont be sad youll get brawler soon hope for legendaryüëå
---
Looks clearly like Creature from the Black Lagoon. This sub is showing how young it is lol
---
I think the girl could be cursed doll jessie

Her eye colors swapped.
---
How do you set your username to a character
---
That's the best art I've seen
---
Right. And tell me how good he does in showdown, lone star, siege etc.
---
ah ok
---
Yeah that might make sense. Maybe once they release all the themes they will release some sort of brawl map
---
Hablbablabalbala. It looks like Gene.
---
I really hope you know those are glow sticks
---
HJONK HJONK

Mortis is not a vampire. He‚Äôs a mortician.
---
honestly tho, a solid 8/10
---
And I was looking at that with my phone below my waist
---
You might as well just throw if that happens
---
U forgot a brawler in the water(left bottom ) here u think there is a new brawler
---
Nickatnyte?
---
This is beautiful. Rico is so hated on as a basic useless character.
---
I mean, this won't change that, but at least now he can lose in style.
---
No
---
Aww damn, my dreams ruined. It's fine, there will probably be many more little shorts with people getting their own voices, maybe not the exact same but I can quench my thirst for more of this brawl Stars animation this way
---
thats just an rpg
---
well now you did
---
Hello there!
---
isn't that the contour of Mortis Mansion? just sayin.
---
That's very understandable
---
I think the silhouette is Mortis Mortuary
---
Post this in the Humor flair it's more better
---
Make his 2nd also remove the pause charge when under 30% hp. Making that HP add more value.
---
The attack still stops him. Just not during the charge. Kind of like Bibi.
---
Some Toilet Fridge that can only startup
---
Is.. Nita.. dabbing?
---

---
