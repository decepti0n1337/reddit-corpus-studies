so? it‚Äôs rly low odds to pull a legendary, especially with only 143 boxes.
---
So if that happens to more than one person it‚Äôs no longer a glitch?
---
Woahhh this is amazing! They should make this a skin!

Then you must be from the future my friend 11/30/19 is two months away
---
I don‚Äôt doubt that it‚Äôs hard, but how often do they release new skins? Maybe a couple every few months. They really don‚Äôt have time to make attack animations? I‚Äôll give them the benefit of the doubt for now because they released 2 new game modes and a brawler. I just hope to see more new attack animations in the future.
---
He never opened up boxes. Early draws are predetermined. Poco is one of those draws
---
I don‚Äôt know but I also don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs possible. There‚Äôs a time limit and not very many chests. Unless you‚Äôre that good ü§îü§îü§î

Very well made. Stuff like this gives me a reason to search around this subreddit.

For his regular attack it should just be water
---
Now this is what I would call a *legendary* synergy lol
---
Great idea!

Why did you get downvoted tf.

You forgot to add the sheriff in the title. Colt is not confirmed to be part of the junker family.

---
I know o really shouldn‚Äôt be defending them but how would you like something completely random a attack animation takes about a month to perfect but I‚Äôm guessing they change their minds a lot. Also they want there work to be worth while. Keep in mind this team of attack animations had new brawlers attacks priority‚Äôs first. Skins second. So I estimate it takes about 3 months to get a full fledge attack and then they might dust it so it may not be worth it in their minds.

Kinemaster is an app
---
Spawn camping is one of the Lone Star strategies, learn to bush check or dont play lol
---
That looks nice. I would def get it if I didn‚Äôt already have dragon knight Jesse.
---
Instead of getting sandy I got Leon, Mortis and Bibi. üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
---
I was actually so disappointed that I didn't actually have him, it looked too believeable
---
Exactly üëåüëå

I really want a new brawler with a sword

I like how there's still has u/GEDI_KOR on it

Anyone gonna talk about the shield?

You sure did go suck mode on them
---
I learnt my lesson. In 10 hours im deleting the post
---
Well alright then
---
This is so wholesome
---
But he needed boxes to max sandy out though, yeah?
---
Oh I mean the discounted token doubler deals and discounted tickets, do you have any idea?
---
Sorry, but I have a lot on my plate at the moment, but if you go to my community you could request there as a post and I could get back to you later on!

I would kill for This!

No one likes getting spawn camped. So when you spawn camp, just think about all of those people's days being ruined because of *you.* Also, sure, it's an easy way to get trophies, but about 80% of people including myself, don't really focus on pushing trophies, or getting brawlers out of their tilts after the season ends. All we care about is having fun playing the game. Spawn camping and getting spawn camped melts all the fun out of the game, making your time spent useless. Also, bush camping in showdown depletes every last morsel of enjoyment.

This is why I can‚Äôt stop anime. THOSE GIRLS ARE SO HE*KING HOT!!!

Thanks üòÅ
---
Well, as I said, he just has access to magic. That's what those pouches are attached to his waste: magic sand that he can use to attack, or create small sandstorms.
---
As for the sjkilar color palette, if we refer to KairosTime's BrawlTopia theory, a lot of the characters seem to just fit in best little "clans" or groups. And either have matching themes, and on some cases matching/similar color palettes.
---
Examples:
---
- 8-bit, Brock, and Rico fit into a modern urban setting (they also all feature dark blue and have modern gamer like lingo)
---
- Bull, Crow, and Bibi are leather wearing, 50's gang inspired (tough guy greaser talk also)
---
- Shelly, Colt, and Piper are wild west characters (bandit, deputy/sheriff, upper class madam). Throw Barley in there too, because he's the saloon barkeep.
---
- Bo, Nita, and Leon are a native American-esque tribe with Spirit animal vibes (they all wear animal hats and have powers related to said animal)
---
- Penny, Darryl, and Tick are pirates (eye and skulls galore)
---
- Carl and Dynamike are miners (obviously)
---
- Mortis and Frank have that creeper/monster vibe (also they both have drabby clothes and purple skin)
---
- Tara, Gene, and Sandy all have a mystical, magical desert feel (think mystical lost arcane arts from the Middle East. They also all share the same color palette)
---
- Jessie and Pam are tinkerers, or junkers, building things from scraps in junkyards.
---
This last group is a stretch, but I wanna say Poco, Spike, and El Primo have this "weird west" vibe to them all. Like, tall tale sort of characters that are otherwise really unbelievable. (El primo gets lumped in here because his original character blurb features him gaining powers from getting hit by a meteor).
---
Never noticed 50 posts about this huh?
---
No i am actually barley. You are always in the middle of your team.
---
trophies for kill or "StopTheSpin", because if players really want teams to stop, they just stop them
---
Ya, okay I see your thought process now
---
Also, i meant about the two dynamikes on their team. I actually didn‚Äôt notice the trophy count of tick until now lol.
---
lmao thanks! In my opinion, though, the shades of colors aren't very accurate as in the real game. Also, you can clearly see that someone colored it instead of one color throughout an object. However, I really appreciate your compliment! That really makes me feel good about my weakness.

but wheres he gonna put his thermos?
---
nah
---
He will just eat pizza rolls straight out of the oven
---
Yum
---
Don't really care but congrats
---
He didn‚Äôt max him out in that video
---
The title literally says "Brawl Stars"
---
These tips are not from Brawl Stars but he is just saying that most loading screen tips in Brawl Stars are useless just like these tips
---
They could be green with a bluish/reddish outline but if you just barely tinged it blue/red it might not be noticeable
---
No, they didnt name el primo, el primo said ell pweemo
---
I love Ring Pops so it would be sweet!
---
Omfg  taras face
---
My friend bought spike, leon and sandy. Thinking of disregarding him as a friend
---
ew his new walking animation disgust me, he used to be my 3rd favorite brawler :,(
---
well either i'm terribly unlucky or something cause randoms at 800 are still mainly bad
---
Lol imagine if no one noticed him and just left him there until the match was over
---
Last place confirmed
---
Nice job man I just got mi Rico to 600 In this map
---
No, you can't report them for being bad. Cry somewhere else
---
I don‚Äôt either, but it‚Äôs impossible to beat Supercell‚Äôs Intro Music‚Äôa Loudness. It just is!
---
I know. I thought it girl when i first saw him but then somebody wrote it's boy and I heard his voice and it's true
---
Plsease skins Is boxes
---
Thank you! I am glad you can relate to one of my worst fears lmao
---
His face says boy
---
But his nails say girl
---
I know , its ...... inevitable
---
Lol oops
---
Considering that u have all brawlers maced out I would say it was expected
---
Same... it‚Äôs impossible
---
I have 10 trophies to and no legendary brawlers
---
Mortis is gonna be so happy
---
*snaps*
---
Omg hes here. Keep on making these great vids(and dont die making them)!
---
That happens a lot cuz of randoms lol they rly need to fix the matchmaking i dont want to play with new players while playing with my 750 poco
---
omg this is so well done! I hope this is actually put in the game.
---
So basically unless you play with a preformed team you aren't good at the game?
---
He will be! We can all be friends and I‚Äôll make everyone some of my famous Spicy Kickin Chicken Soup!
---
Bout to say...

The guy just wants a legendary brawler

yeah, you can even catch some omen's on your team.

Wow, √© bellissimo questo montaggio

Oh also how do you do this type of writing?

---
Oh sorry hahaha
---
Have this problem for 6 months. Sometimes even 4 or 5 games in a row and it got worst since 8-bit release. And somehow i face more lag with some brawlers. I'm playing Clash royale, coc, and rush wars right now without a single problem.

True

Hey guy did you know that human can drink lava but only once
---
Wow 120.

Try reaching 150 cubes or sth to see if the game crashes
---
The funniest thing is that you reposted it
---
i play on mute
---
This looks like it could be good! Keep it up
---
Fakenews, i can clearly see power 2
---
I think it is because BB is a fast mode if you know how to play and make pushing even better
---
Yeah but i could really say the same thing about Heist
---
At first I tought "Oof what a nice feeling seeing all different brawlers" then I realise...
---
You should check out my idea for a barley star power lol
---
if only supercell were so nice
---
He got Sandy in his first box he opened. Before he unlocked Sandy his brawl box count was 2657 when he unlocked Sandy his brawl box count was 2656 so he got Sandy in his first box. Now here you are saying it actually took bentimm 50 boxes to unlock Sandy not 1 Just watch the video &amp; Go Fuck
---
Ahah will try
---
At this point, I can't believe people are still wondering if supercell is bad a balancing or money hungry.
---
it's clearly a strategy. They release a brawler &gt; people buy it cause it's a cheat code &gt; they nerf the brawler &gt; repeat.
---
It is not a game supposed to be fair, it is a cash machine. And if people would stop being pigeons, maybe supercell would stop this disgusting behavior
---

Yeah but I killed him again

---
Used your template, i liked it :)
---
Yeah I think the matchmaking is a fraud now
---
Lol
---
Ikr I took sandy just for shits and giggles and wound up first place because I was the only one who actually bothered to go for the bot...
---
Of course we will not let supercell to give mortis +1000 above health tho. I think a small buff to health can make him better. Like from 3800 base hlth to 4000 is ok i guess.
---
Yeah.... especially piper's. Every match I have played with a piper in it you can tell it's a auto-aim piper so they just attack what moves
---
is it better now?
---
Good work dude ! :D
---
Brawl ball: you still can't defeat me

You got medical use at least lol

Unless you got 5 other player chase behind you

Sand can't be eaten üò´üò£

ya but the piper used super to jump towards enemies and it makes me wonder why not use close trophies
---
What non sense, supercell brought this update because most of 70% people wanted that brawl ball should be permanent ,go watch in YouTube but I think seige should be removed permanently
---
Not for me. I legit feel like randoms were better under 300 trophies than after 700...
---
Not me

Thats relay good

The key to this mode is learning to survive, and knowing when to attack other players and the boss. Consider collecting power cubes at the start where you think no one will go to, and avoid getting cornered by players. Rack up about 7-8 power cubes in whatever way you can and try chipping some of the boss‚Äô health and then attack low power cubes players and repeat the process.

This is what I did with Leon, 0 Deaths

I went against Yamada and his global pushing team and I was using my  level 2 sandy and I won them easily

Takedown splits my brain in half, learning when to attack the boss and other players at the right time. Requires much strategy depending on the brawler and avoid death at all costs.

Boy voice and a little girly appearance = Alien

rice can destory so be careful
---
Which other legendary do you have?
---
I hate it when everyone is playing one brawler. But configuring meteors to attack ppl who are bushcamping is really hard, but if it is possible then the meteors might just attack everyone who is in a bush which means everyone will stop using tanks and shellies and instead use piper or Brock which will be even more annoying. What do you think about takedown I think it's even more unfair because ppl just camp near the edge of the map and keep collecting power cubes and when ever the boss is like at 30% health 28 powercube leon or bull will come in to take the victory while ppl with 4 powercubes are working hard to damage the boss as much as they and when 28 powercube guy comes in he hits the boss 3 times and the 4 powercube guy goes from "you're in the lead!" to "keep up the good work" instantly in seconds he falls from his well deserved no. 1 position... I mean I know that supercell don't think to much about balancing when they make a new brawler or new game mode (ex: bandaid and old seige) but my God, these games are either unfair or scummy depending on which way you look at it. In takedown while dealing damage to the boss you always get trapped between someone with 12 powercubes or more and the boss so you have to run through the boss taking tons and tons damage but there is someone else on other side who will then kill you. I don't know if this is because of the compact maps or something else but it's really unfair more unfair then lonestar could ever be...
---
It's bee sniper
---
Agreed. Balancing around star powers is retarded for most of the population in
---
Alien=transgender
---
Well, I'm a piper who solely focuses on the bot after killing 2-3 enemies or till I get 5-7 cubes. I attack anyone who attacks me. Otherwise I leave em alone, unless you're roaming around with low health and just asking to be sniped.
---

Ranked 1st a few times with 8bit and pam, ranked 2nd with gene once too (use super to pull low health brawlers for easy power cubes)
---
uh the bottle breaks into like 30 sharp bits so..
---
Yeah i used to watch this years ago
---
I understand no offense for that comment
---
That‚Äôs true too
---
Yeah me too. I love bb but it gets stale after the first 5 matches
---
They are though..
---
Draw 8 bit being played by another 8bit
---
In the brawltalk they said 'he' so its safe to assume that its a dude
---
our next brawler attacks by throwing trash!
---
please don‚Äôt be one of those people who say ‚ÄúInsTaGraM BaD ReDdiT gOOd‚Äù. let people use what they want.
---
The problem was that they weren't a preformed team - matchmaking went from 1/6 one by one all the way to 6/6. And somehow they lopped all the 900s together and left me with guys that are 400 trophies lower than our opponents. Honestly these teammates were higher than a lot of the ones I've had tonight.  I've been consistently getting paired with 300 carls and 200 bos (which I somehow won after the most massive carry ever)
---
Happy cake day

I spent the entire match trying to protect the boss and pick up as many power cubes as possible. 90 is my best so far!

Trophies ? and also are u a f2p ?

I saw people camping in bushes in takedown.... Like why tf are people camping in takedown the only way to win is damage on the robot

This is so true... when the bot is at 25% and you die you can literally never reach it before it dies...
---
And then there are the random people walking around the map with 20 power cubes that kill you before you get there...
---
K thnx
---
Unnecessary, the matchmaking time only takes around 3-5 seconds so there‚Äôs really no time to read the tips.. also they‚Äôre useless.
---
Sim
---
So why the hell did u say that?
---
Because wanted a shelly nerf &gt;:&lt;
---
She is annoying af :&gt;
---
so at 544 you got the newest legendary and I can't get a single legendary at 12k seems fair
---
Love it
---
No one cares
---
yeS siR-
---
Timing is a key!
---
Yas ;&gt;
---
Yep, really fair...
---
Atta boi! I wish we hired more people like you in our company.
---
Yeah But People Who Over Like 1000 Takes More Then 10 Miniets
---
There is no strategy. It‚Äôs just a shit show. The absolute worst game mode, by far. Even lower skill than solo showdown.
---
Thanks man, maybe in the future this could happen :)
---
And a little bit of prediction ;)
---
:&lt;? Ke
---
Yup
---
Before we mock him, we must know the answer to this.
---
I‚Äôm having fun playing it tho, strat is to basically try to ignore fighting and head for the big robot to deal some damage. It basically tests your dodging skills from brainless enemies wasting their ammos on you instead of the Big Robot.
---
√áok g√ºzel bence
---
Bull it's another case of poorly design.
---
Putting  the meme of a camping bull aside (Because it no longer works in 400+ trophies, you know, people don't facecheck bushes anymore), it's ridiculous how a tank relies 100% on people approaching him cuz he has extremely low damage at medium range but one of the best damage dealer in the game when mele range, no gap-closers, an useless super in every game mode but BB and less health than other tanky brawlers like Primo.
---
And if that wasn't enough, Shelly exists.
---
Why would I take a screenshot? I can post I picture of my player profile.. I have no reason to lie
---
Isn't skull creek coming back in lone star
---
Ke but still this doesn't deserve the up votes :&lt;
---
Sandy x Leon
---
Ke wtf? Give this lad some up votes ;&gt;
---
Creepy harvest is already op
---
Coiled snake did needed a nerf
---
They don't just look at community for balancing. They look at use rate, win rate and pick rate
---
A bit over 14k.
---
My experience with programming is quite decent and I'm currently employed in IT company as a programmer.
---
But I just thought that you may be in fact right, cause my native language is Russian. So around me people usually say general terms like "integer type" in Russian, but use English words like "integer" (or "int"), "short" and others to refer to a specific type. 
---
So yeah, thanks for your patience :)
---
Tanks will still out damage him at 1v1, have more health and more range.
---
Me everytime
---
Not really, he did 2.8k damage per shot which is still less than Pam/Darryl
---
Skull Creek is now map for LONE STAR
---
See ya in hot
---
Say what you want but I hardly post at all, and have never had more than like 30 up votes, so stop with all that negativity lol
---
Players in Takedown should not drop power cubes so people will focus mainly on the Robot instead of fighting 1v1 50miles away from the robot...
---
I had a colt zone me the fuck away from the Robot while I was playing Bull.... like buddy... we‚Äôre both not getting anything here....
---
D: never been soo negative srry I'm usually a weeb
---
so today i had 26 gems at first then i got 11 gems from 2 boxes and now went from 37 gems to 137 mega stonks
---
Should‚Äôve played around it
---
Even a Piper can delete a Mortis in narrow passages with her second star power.
---
He need unload speed buff imo maybe slightly
---
Darryl is very fun
---
I'm finding takedown more fun than lone star atm, mostly because unlike lone star there isn't bush camping. It's also strategic, in that you can go for the boss or try to kill someone else to charge your super and collect their cubes. I haven't seen the camping and collecting 28 powercubes method so far, maybe that's why I'm enjoying it. I think both the modes either it needs to be longer or shorter. If it is shorter it punishes you hard for dying, but also eliminates bush camping and power cubes camping. That's the only good thing I can think about it being shorter so in hindsight maybe not shorter. If it is longer, then you have a higher chance of making a comeback but also high stress if you are in lead lol. I think you are right, that the maps don't really seem to be that good. I can't put my fingers on it. Imo maybe the maps are too large, so in lone star you are trying to find opponents to kill and in take down you are trying to get to the boss asap after spawning and it uses valuable time. Both modes punishes you hard for dying and I'm thinking most of my opinion comes from the fact I'm not very good at surviving. Also Shelly seems to be too good in both modes, atleast from the maps we have seen so far. Everybody is scared of her super. Doesn't matter if your the tankiest brawler with 30 powercubes, her one super is enough to mess your whole game and that's a real feelsbad moment. They need to nerf her super because especially lone star so far from what I can see is dominated by her. It would be ok if she was high skill brawler but it's just shoot shoot shoot super shoot win. I think Supercell has been trying to get more solo games in because most people complain about randoms. These two game modes are such good ideas but so far just hasn't been implemented that well. What I think they thought lonestar would be, is like their "No time to explain" YouTube video, where there is a diverse amount of brawlers and everybody is trying to win among the chaos but unfortunately what's happened is Shelly super in your face and bush camping. Maybe changing the brawlers from 10 to 6 might also change up the game? Sorry about this massive post.
---
Yes. Especially when Im laggin and I move at 1 fps
---
i guess very soon
---
I doubt that.
---
This is a problem, but the effects could appear only to the player or they could appear normally but with a smaller range, or the effect would not appear if the player was in a bush. Thanks for the comment! ‚Ä¢‚Äø‚Ä¢
---
Yeah, just starve them all

I shouldn't have to prove anything, but here.. Properties of the screenshot.

Few hours ago, there was 46 power cubes shelly, she was toying with all of us
---
(Chucles)*i'm in danger
---
Correct me if i‚Äôm wrong... but isn‚Äôt that still like a 99.68% chance to not get one? lol but it is high.
---
he used all the gold to buy his new suits
---
Thank you mortalitybot, very cool
---
Now I really wish this was in the game. Great job üëç
---
With a level 4 spike..
---
Awesome! Looks very good. If you don't mind me asking, how did you get the leon icon?
---
I'll think, but soon I'll post other cool ideas. ( Íàç·¥óÍàç)
---
Lol, its automatically starts when you scrolling down
---
Go for it! I believe un you my man :D
---
U r doing ok should be normal primo with winning animation
---
I think shark leon should throw fish
---
ogm how did yuo get 5 legnedrys!?!?!!!!!!?!!!!!
---
Damn look at the gold
---
I found it in a video
---
I want to like Darryl. But he‚Äôs the least tanky tank. He can‚Äôt hold a candle to Primo, Rosa, Bull not Frank.
---
No, what do you need to do for this?
---
Steven universe?
---
DECREASE? Have you used sandy? Its already almost as slow as mortis
---
\*war of the worlds tripod sound effect\*
---
\*\*\*KILL THE DINAMIKE SCUM\*\*\*
---
Yeah, hope you do get a viral vid or something
---
I did not think of that. ü§î
---
or walk through a swamp
---
Dude, Sandy is a boy.
---
No, you and the other Primo lived
---
You could also show your account to the naysayers. I frequently have to show my account info to people. Then they usually shut up. I got Sandy in 4 regular boxes. But I‚Äôm fully maxed and have been playing since day 1 of beta. I‚Äôm also P2W so I would‚Äôve bought him anyways ($70 CDN is the price tag).
---
Nope
---
Bull's super should be quicker. It should take him half the time to go from start to end. That way it gives him a chance to surprise enemies instead of getting killed during the dash.
---
Nice !
---
The trick is to be incredibly pathetic but show potential. That way, girls will come to mold you into what they want. ;)
---
I can't wait!
---
Spikes star power might get in his own way
---
yeah change it it would be great. but remember sandy is a boy
---
whoaaaaa. my eyes are blessed
---
I had the same experience with Piper. I just sat back shooting the bot while everyone else fought, did pretty well.
---
That Bo on the right side knows it's over
---
You're welcome!
---
So like when that one YTer did cosplay
---
r/no
---
Its should not shown to enemies
---
Unlikely, but thanks for the suggestion!
---
Your the BEST
---
The power cubes are BIG issue in take down, but I don‚Äôt believe is SUPER bad. It just needs readjustments.     
---
It‚Äôs a completely new mode anyways.
---
They‚Äôre bots
---
God damn, and I can't even get 20 gold...
---
I'll take 39 gold any day!
---
What is that?
---
You went on a losing streak so it matched u with bots
---
üòä
---
Dovresti fare video su Youtube sai?
---
Very well done art. I will stick to El Rey anyway...he's the boss!
---
I've found that people with the most power cubes don't necessarily do well. They focus so much on collecting more cubes that they don't end up attacking the boss as often.
---
nah, su youtube nessuno li vede i video di canali piccoli, invece qui su reddit possono vedere in 4000 il tuo post in un giorno.
---
Are you sure that it isnt good? Cause I think its AMAZING!
---
Draw bull but he's an actual bull
---
I did too yesterday
---
Remember the community animation project that happened a while ago? This is it! The reward you get for having one of your cels (Segment of an animation) in the animation!
---
Well it has a custom animation
---
Holy shit
---
But you have to understand! He is not a tank! He is an ASSASIN! And you play assasins the same way as leon and mortis. With darryl you use your super to roll onto enemies and kill them quickly (like assasins do) and why are you saying that darryl cant kill frank? Frank is loterally an easy kill for darryl if he lands a good roll. You can do the same with shelly (when she doesnt have super) because you have bigger DPS than shelly (ofc without super) and kill her.
---
Facts ^

suddenly a cars time appeared from nowhere
---
Honestly I think he's fine as he moves incredibly slowly and his shots are spread out
---
Sorry, but I can only accept submissions through posts to my community, r/Fort_MaximusFanBase, or from a direct message!
---
O un idea.....
---
I‚Äôm gonna be honest, no, it will not. If anything, it gives the opponent MORE time to move. More than likely they‚Äôre gonna be keeping their distance from Frank anyways
---
dica
---
Oops! Sorry this is my first post I was so excited that I just messed it up.
---
Give me an idea now and I'll take a go at it
---
Nice üëç
---
Porto tutti i vedeo che o fatto su Youtube su reddit
---
im so dead
---
bell'idea
---
Idk what to tell u haha. Play sneakier
---
Frank is mining fatigue
---
Sadly i never and will never experience the feeling of getting a legendary
---
ricordati di far passare almeno un giorno fra un post e l'altro (e anche che il video non deve durare 3 minuti)
---
Did you stole that idea from me? I legit suggested that several times
---
Oh for sure. You‚Äôve had bad luck. but eventually you‚Äôll get one
---
You are doing OK&gt;next screen&gt; -2 trophies.

How the fuck do u play sneakier

Yeah... good penis you draw there (in Leon‚Äôs butt)

OhhüôÇ, I didn't realize that

On my way!

Should add some black outlines
---
Colt with Slick Boots is so awesome on this map.
---
Yep
---
I thought about it like Brock's fourth rocket, it's always there but only usable with a star power. But thanks for the feedback!
---
then im blind or it looks big because of all that detail
---
Nope. Once u use your power points on a brawler, and u apparently have a few over the required, those power points get discarded so use the power points on a brawler that u want to upgrade but also has at close to 350 power points left to go until it can be upgraded.

It will convert to coins

why did they give u 100 gems?

It's not bad at all

a consolation prize would be cool

Yeah:( local multiplayer i mean

I think some colors will seem like other brawlers, it would be confussing

I swear I made them all by myself. If you have already seen some, I don't know why.

Its so annoying things like this, there should be a range of trophies where you cant play with low trophies. The bull didnt knew anything about the game.
---
and still not a legendary

Thank you so much. If you have any skill, in programming(to create modded servers) or in art design. For brawler art creations you can pm meüòâ

Im sorry :(

Sure

I dont get it

What am i looking at

He can‚Äôt do a backflip, but he‚Äôs still pretty cool. He does a bunch of „ÄåMenacing„Äç poses and his idle win is him looking like he‚Äôs about to punch.

Dynamike.

Sandy.
---
Frank.
---
How about just make shark leon a 30 gem skin
---
No, you should say \*phew\* at 2:09 Because the time for the Boss to win is 2:10 now.
---
First if all, why would you BUFF Shelly by giving her additional armor? not to mention that you are just basically copying Bibi's star power which shows lack of creativity and second.. If you give Spike the ability to make walls with his attacks, imagine if you go on a showdown match and there are atleast 3-5 Spikes building walls everywhere, just try to think about it. Wouldn't you think that it's dumb? and Spike can just spam his regular attack hoping that the enemy gets trapped in the walls and use super. Good enough of an explanation for you?
---
The power cubes make the game very hectic and some players don‚Äôt even try to kill the robot. Some brawlers feel completely op (ex: bull with his tough guy sp) and others are useless. Personally I‚Äôm not willing to risk my trophies on this mode because of the randomness of it
---
Not your fault m8, but thanks for paying respects
---
this is light mode users friendly

r/blursedimages

Heist one of my favorite game modes and I shouldn‚Äôt have to wait 3 days to play it
---
how come this guy gets 500 upvotes and some other people who post it get 0? not hating btw. just asking
---
I don't get it. Could you explain sorry.
---
amazing
---
lol, makes me laugh
---
I stayed in another comment I'd need spike in my rework. Don't have much ideas for Shelly but it is not exactly the same as bibi. I might think of it.
---
Flair checks out.
---
I don‚Äôt think its toxic at all, pretty easy to avoid them/ render then useless if you use the right brawlers for the map
---
First of all: Really great idea 
---
Second: What does the super actually do, I didn't quite get it from the picture 
---
And Last but not least : the second star power is so OP
---
I'm ready for any suggestion)))
---
Can't blame me for not giving my time to read the handful of comments here
---
Do you even see their trophies? Jesus you're stupid
---
Just got 200 gems
---
I didn't even know that that existed!
---
Dbz reference, gotta love it!
---
I could give you the template if you can improve on it
---
I can't model memes yet
---
I don‚Äôt have a lengendary

Me that spent 60$ on mega boxes
---
Thought i could get em from there should have just bought the damn offer end me :,)
---
Neither did I until I made this new account
---
Some give brawlers insane boost while others do little to nothing
---
That's not even relevant. 
---
"Wow, Mount Everest's actually much higher than I thought!"
---
"But it isn't higher than that volcano on Mars"
---
I have 6 brawlers 500+
---
Can you get em all??
---
When I first looked at it I thought regular primo‚Äôs knee was bulge
---
Position yourself better, and watch its spawn point 
---
Idk what Brawler/s you're playing with, but I like the robot and personally I find it easier with the chaos it causes
---
I may do a rework soon. Can you tell me which ones are bad?
---
its already good without the caption. (good for this sub, not good at all in any other place though)
---
ok
---
Jesus wasn‚Äôt stupid
---
yes, but it's a low effort post, he stole the picture from r/dankmemes
---
I still don‚Äôt understand why that skin isn‚Äôt 500 star points when you literally get it for free
---
Cool
---
key word: CLOSE
---
I don‚Äôt think even with the 2.5k upvotes sc will still see it:/
---
Maybe the attack can be teeth
---
it's worth 150 gems but they give it for free
---
Oops
---
the speed reduction bibi's bat employs is twice that of Shelly's shell shock, which is already strong. and brock's super is basically a much better and upgraded barley super which already offers wayy to much map control.
---
Same here today as well
---
yess lesbian ship
---
Can we get an f for my ears
---
Wow. You get a good point I did not think ofüëç
---
every rarity has a girl except legendaries lol
---
just because he is at low trophies doesn't mean he is bad
---
I gave way more reasoning than just ‚Äúsomeone plays well with a brawler‚Äù, I in fact gave you plenty of valid reasons.
---
No because it creates a second version of the game
---
my guess would be since the September update or sometime not long after would be when SC started making a bigger deal of the scid connection + reward skin 
---
I often make new accounts whenever I get a new idea in my head (although most of them, I don't keep) and the first time I saw this prompt was, I think, around when Sandy got released?
---
way too op: bull, brock, bo, primo, poco, carl, frank, leon. Don't get me wrong, I love the ideas. But some of these would never make it into the game. brock, poco, and primo's are probably the craziest ones. the amount of damage and control those star powers give them is way too broken. change poco to 1 or 1.5 seconds. change brock to 500 damage for 2 seconds because the area of damage is pretty large for it to be on fire for 7 seconds, the extra rocket is fine. change primo's to 500 dmg and probably only 2 meteors. having that much damage come down for 8 seconds in game modes like gem and bb gives a team way too much control. everyone would use him and everyone would hate playing against him. 
---
i also don't think any brawlers should have auto charge supers like the one you said for gene or leon. their super are INCREDIBLY powerful. it's fine with darryl because it's just rolling, it's easy to mess up and counter and only does a small knockback. auto charging leon's invisibility is crazy. gene's super can turn a 10 gem loss into a 10 gem win in 1 play.
---
If you want to play with your friends cause you trust them, then play with them, but if you are 2 you are dragging the 3rd teammate with you, i bet that guy trusted that 300 hundred trophy bull, but that doesnt mean he was good, im talking big tophies gap im 12k above him. Maybe like 6k restriction for rankeds or something like that.
---
Really interesting.
---
First off,  i didn't tell them anything,  i gave a suggestion.  Apparently you're new to reddit and don't realize how much great fan art gets overlooked,  that's a big part of the reason i created r/brawlstarsnextlevel

tbh both of them are bird shit. id rather play showdown than those 2 shit piles of game modes
---
imagine penny on this map XD
---
Not bad at all! Extremelly cute tbh :3
---
How do you expect to balance that without completely reworking Mortis's mechanics?
---
And by this logic, I can say 8-bit needs a buff to help him stand a chance against throwers and Piper, throwers and Piper need a buff to help them stand a chance against Mortis, and etcetera.
---
true dat

Yes, please. Exp levels are just another source of occasional pretty lights and flashy animation for immediate reward - and some tokens now and then.

It seems like everything short of 20k or Rank 30 isn‚Äôt an accomplishment anymore; Supercell made everything so easy
---
lucky, retard
---
I was not in a losing streak I gained around 80 cups with Shelly in showdown
---
It was just the kind of ironic humour
---
Without them making it easy you wont be at 10k, I'm pushing my leon to rank 30 but season reset is gonna destroy my leon's trophies
---
Oh wow, nice job. That impressed me again. You have been proven worthy
---
Guys, chill out. I have 12k but I don't have Piper.

You're so bad that you somehow didn't manage to get star player
