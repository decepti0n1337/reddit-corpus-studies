yeah totally

There is something wrong with the game because I have two devices both using the same network and there is frequently lag on only one device and not the other.  I can switch back and forth for matches and it‚Äôs always my iOS device.  My older android phone does not have this when I have a good connection.  To top it off I am using the IOS device as a hotspot for the android device, and turning off hotspot, Bluetooth and power cycle on iOS will not make the problem go away when it is happening.

What kind of excuse is that?! That does not justify taking other people‚Äôs effort, whether big or small, without their credit.

---
Stealing is stealing. There are no exceptions
---
Once you reach 500 trophies there is literally no reason to push beyond. You dont get special trophies, you don't get loot for having extra trophies on season reset. The only thing you get it -50% trophies on the brawler that are over 500
---
You mean FoRtNiTe
---
It might be good woth the Spile but hes a Cactuse and well,Desert.
---
Also Carl,how it talks,the cart and the pickaxe is too minecraftish.

sometimes ya gotta move with them so they get caught in it

you‚Äôll get used to it life is fair that wayü§£üòÇ
---
ok but what does the umbrella part look like
---
Acceleration causes bullets to go faster the further they go until other forces such as gravity and normal forces causes it to decelerate. Pipers bullets reaches its fastest speed (theoretically) at her furthest range which is why it does the most damage.
---
No
---
Brawlers trophy‚Äôs? Or in general?
---
Great skin as usual! Just one question: How would her regular attack work if she is using a sword? lol
---
Anything goes in showdown, sorry if u got offended and no we don‚Äôt get all our trophies this way, we do it occasionally to have some fun
---
Is that Tara? XD
---
It goes by individual brawler that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs hard to get power 1 to rank 20 because you go against power other rank 20 usually power 10
---
He has one of the best in the game.  Movement speed is one of the things that can make a brawler SUPER good bc u can Dodge more easily.
---
Looks like old chip! Nostalgia:(
---
This is my best mode

*What the fuck did you just bring upon this cursed land*

for millionths time.... REPLAYS are still under development

They are working on ways to STORE all the replays without exploding the servers
---
It is very hard task so hang tight and keep an eye out for news on it
---
They already said it'll be slowly going to be available to all player in the future JUST NOT NOW (technology isn't there yet)
---
T my meat
---
Would be cool but why would we use it matchmaking would take longer and we all know rosa will be the dominant brawler for that game mode.
---
No, because the moderators only check if the same person gets reported 5 times.
---
It's a good idea, it just needs some more work.

Pretty much what everyone else is saying, deal chip damage from range until you have your super and use it when the enemy clumps up. Don't use her in heist or siege, she has control but not a lot of dps to take out the IKE, safe, or siege bot. She is a good option in control based game modes like gem grab. Try not to use her in bounty as she has low health and needs to get close to take out brawlers, you can use her, but it will be tough, unless you have a good team comp set up beforehand.

This would be difficult to implement now unless you intend on resetting the stats on existing accounts. SC probably doesn‚Äôt keep the specific data of past games (ie. Games that occurred two years ago during beta) so we‚Äôd all have to start from scratch.

I once got a leon while invisible with mortis he didn't expect me to expect him to expect me of foing right so he changed directions while invisible. He went into a wall. And then I attacked. He didn't even see it coming and he was totally trapped...

I felt like the best player in the world for that match...

srsly tho props for the effort

Nice, but can u show is the battle log for this battle. It looks like friendlies because names of brawlers over 300 trophies don‚Äôt appear
---
But whenever i see a brawlers left  then i will see poco or Jessie with 0 powercube coming out of a bush covered in poison, so you don't need the power cubes
---
What the fuck have just brought onto this cursed land

Not much a fan on animals, but this is really cute.

No its Pam.. where she says "I'll fix you up" so I replaced fix with f***

I did not say that but some people say that . Like read one of the comments on this particular post tue guy said Spoilers

Just Nerf her star power and super just a bit but please mainly nerf her star power

yes

Funny thing is, while I was trying Leon I reached 5k and opened the mega box and got Gene. A day like no other hahaha

Wow that‚Äôs pretty funny and true but you know who really needs a buff POCO!!! (YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW MUCH WE HAVE SUFFERD DUDE NOT EVEN THE BAT SUMMONERS KNOW IT!!!)

It‚Äôs not me it‚Äôs some guy in my club
---
Why would Poco be a rapist like dude that‚Äôs not like him and if you ask me a Poco main I think it would be disturbing the peace with the music he‚Äôs playing loudly
---
bro, it's not hard for supercell to make it so that there is a standard level for the brawlers that join, and I doubt it's hard to find 2 people with the same character, and if u don't like it, then how about making it possible to play as brawlers u don't have like in clash royal, and for ranks just make it any rank and add power cubes to the map so even if ur new u can still win with power cube advantage
---
I actually killed 10 Shellys in sperate games

of SD and I was a Poco so they got what they deserved

Oh my gurd

No that‚Äôs a seagull

Skull creek is still without modifier and I think that there will be a throwermap if supercell wants throwers as meta.
---
I once tilt my Crow below 400 and got into a game of siege with randoms...and then we went on a winning streak for a whopping 2 hours. My Crow is now slightly below 600 because we lost the last match we‚Äôre together.
---
You rang?
---
Wtf is meme caption?
---
POCO MAINS RISE UP
---
There have been games with literally only Rosa...

LETS ROCK!!!! WITH THROUGH THE FIRE AND FLAMES ( I hear Poco has world record on that one)

Even disregarding staff shortage, I think replays would also have to be implemented fully before such a report system would be functional.

Nice play but misleading title.

Most of the mirroring programs now are integrated with useful features, including screen recording, screenshots taking and so on. For that, I would recommend [ApowerMirror](https://www.apowersoft.com/phone-mirror) app. It allows you to record your screen, take screenshots, do some annotations and a lot more. It is also compatible with iOS and Android devices. to use it, simply download this app on your computer  and iPhone then connect your iOS device by going to control center. Tap on 'Screen Mirroring' then select the name of your computer with apowersoft.

Removed - Your post is too short, please expand on your title.
---
Jesus: _heals others._ every brawler except poco, pam and gene with starpower: *wait, that's illegal.*
---
&gt; To make Poco and others viable for high trophy solo
---
Not all brawlers have to be good at all game modes. It's ok for some to be better than others and when a support brawler isn't good in a solo BR, that's ok since he is a healer, not a damage dealer.
---
The issue with your other suggestion is that damaging boxes is meant to be risky. Like using all 3 shots to almost open a box and then a Primo or Rosa runs over and you have to decide if it's worth it to stay and fight for the box or run away since you have less ammo and likely lose the fight. They are there to encourage risky play and get fights going.
---
No thank you

Yeah my Frank is ok when I play him, random Frank's though...

I didn't even save boxes, just used coins to buy her points in the shop and got the star power from a box yesterday. Once you have all power points, you make about 2000 coins in 3 days.

Yeah but the characters aren't all Wild Wesry where as West Legends are all that theme.

Btw I didn't even realize Brawlstars was wild west until like three weeks ago when somebody did a cover of the song and I heard some notes I'd never heard before... And then I realized the cactuses and grass and dirt and oh my gosh it's wild west theme wtf how did I miss this

Only the boxes

Which is correct because it confused the hell out of me when I first played it

Why did they remodel it like that it looks awful, imo

Well.... I didn't read the description when I was a newbie... so yeah I was hella confused at first

He has a bunch of problems, which is sad seeing as he‚Äôs never acknowledged or noticed by Supercell.

And do I get In game rewards for it?

I get that now, but I don't know why they [can't stream replay data to a file in real time]((https://www.reddit.com/r/brawlstarsmodding/comments/bkffhb/replays_under_400_trophies/), which would avoid the bandwidth issues. If they couldn't do that then making screen recording a built in feature would be appreciated since Android doesn't have one built in.

At no point did they make this clear so here I am guessing.

Thank you!
---
It was a mode in showdown where you slowly lost your HP and only by killing (or attacking? I don't remember.) other players could you get your HP back. Which of course made it pretty much impossible to team.
---
Also: Piper Paradise
---
I tried to send a friend request but he had too many lol

Nooooooooooo its already bad in gem grab, so why do you want to make me lose more of my trophies?!?! What have i don to you?????

I really love playing as Rico in this map, It‚Äôs so satisfying. hahaha

According to supercell, it is because beginners don't really understand what is life leach.
---
That happened to me about a week ago
---
This is true.
---
If you are a new player you will have a legendary in the next day
---
Yea same for me tdy, there are so many matches in brawl tv over 1000 spectators ( normally there are fewer than 300 )

That's racism lol

I think el primo is in the opposite category.

Thats really a cool idea!!

I like it, 10/10.

Looks cool, but it would suck gameplay wise

No ones fucking talking to you

Another great idea would be pumpkin spike or Jack o Lantern spike

Of course man you can use it!

Agreed. I am kind of a gene main too and I find him really powerful, I feel so insecure when I see the enemies use gene too.

---
Are your nips not as strong as his?
---
Actually, it was thanks to Nita‚Äôs bear keeping Frank busy so that he wasn‚Äôt involved in your fight with Pam that you were able to survive with 10 gems carrying home. Colt was trolling, that‚Äôs undeniable, but that Nita was still fighting to take back the gems, thus the word ‚Äúdoing nothing‚Äù is quite incorrect and disrespectful in this scenario. I do admitted that your play was very good, almost single-handedly wrecked the opposite team but please don‚Äôt take all the pride to yourself, leaving your teammate in the shadow, especially when they are still battling with you, even if they‚Äôre not that good. Remember, Gem Grab requires teamwork, which means no single player can beat the other team without their teammates so next time please give, even just a tiny amount, credit to the teammate that actually play. Without all of that out of the way, have a good day m8!

If you play with primo you automatically lose 10 chromosomes during the game

(Backstabbing r/Punpatrol)

No, it was already in the game in 2016. I just checked my post on CoC forum and it confirms it. My idea was to let us know by displaying the name and not an eye üëÅ icon who‚Äôs spectating us even if not during the attack but at least afterwards, and their response was what I mentioned above.
---
Liiike it
---
Remember global players.
---
‚ÄúWere able to do this.‚Äù
---
How much üèÜ?
---
Well his argument is silly.  Rosa has MORE range because ROSA does NOT have a distance closing super.  
---
Primo has LESS range because PRIMO DOES have a distance closing super.  
---
How do you not see the balance?
---
What do you dislike about this map?
---
Im on 393 w jessie and WON rank 1 without teaming. Idk how I made it but I killed rosa, two teaming bos and a shelly. Yeah I didnt know I could do that too. I tried to betray penny but she got killed so Nice.

Would've been a lot more impressive if they didn't ad star power
---
üëèNoüëèOneüëèCares
---
no 2000 damage only 500
---
Turning darryl from a heavyweight to an assassin could possibly mean giving him a speed buff. All heavyweights move at 770 units. All assassins of any kind move at 820 units. All other brawlers move at 720 except for colt if he has his star power, in that case he will move at 780 units. Even though that may be a bit too much of a buff for darryl, it can help him a lot with mobility.
---
so you play calculator 2 the game
---
Damn

I got mortis like the day after they nerfed him in bb it looked like so much fun
---
Br na area
---
Probably 1500 trophies lol
---
Some cart to follow teamers...
---
Yee
---
Perfectly balanced
---
Mortis, creature of the light
---
colt always lasers me

That Purple Drank !
---
In English?
---
Wait that's illegal
---
I think that bo doesn't need a nerf. Neither carl. He should be in the meta at least 2 to 3 months. He is good without star power, but even better with star power. He definitely has his counters.
---
Time to stop
---
He might I think this is as good if not better then gedis skin I had this idea in my kind and you brought it to live props to you man
---
why suffer tho
---
No. But my youngest brother
---
Thanks for the awesome meme template!
---
#Nita wants have cubes, Nita must have cubes
---
Beeaaaaar
---
Grunt
---
Um... she is throwing her cards through boxes and people at the same time..  are you seriously debating the reason Tara's range and potency is fine but Rosa's is not?  
---
C'mon...... c'mon...
---
Well, I have 4K trophies and still haven‚Äôt got Carl neither none of the legendaries, I opened a mega box today and haven‚Äôt got nothing
---
There's a Rico plushie in Santa Mike's bag?
---
take a second look and realize primos chest has no detail lmao
---
Lol ur at 4800 dumbass
---
And then there's me that thought shouting "OH MY GOD I GOT PAM" in my classroom was worth it...
---
 Brawlers who could me an different
---
Yeah they need to come out with a new solo mode for players that dont have alot of time to play steady everyday. Cause I'm beyond sick of showdowns bullshit
---
Dude, the birds don't have teeth, Crow need to be with the robots and Spike
---
snas
---
Idk why but this post made me laugh so hard
---
But does he have the n-word pass?
---
Morco Potis &lt;Marco Polo, change my mind
---
If that Dyna has SP there could still be a chance
---
To repel teamers, the minecarts should be armed with a Jessie/penny cannon that‚Äôll target people (penny in a large group)
---
Would make more sense if the zombie was actually near spike
---
Wouldn‚Äôt really do anything specifically against teams. Everything you mentioned could just as well happen to anyone else.
---
Am I the only one wondering who the hell Coach Cory is?
---
*insert actual OG mortis skin*
---
Pootis :v\*TF2 Intensifies :v
---
still XD good one
---
is happy with having every legendary before 2K
---
I had a game like this 10 minutes ago
---
She already got nerfed u idiotüëè
---
As a global player I don't feel safe in this comment section
---
I agree but I just want them to add it instead of showdown, cos let's be honest, showdown is a shit game mode with alot of unfairness and with seige having giving more rewards it's kinda useless and it's only loved cos it doesn't require teammates
---
Actually, most of us are randoms
---
Yeah, unfortunately melee with spike is a Russian roulette
---
Too soon.
---
Que incr√≠vel mano! Muito bem feita! 
---
Coloca uma marca d'√°gua ai ou os cara passa a m√£o, faz s√≥ uma repost e tira print desse post mostrando teu nome pra depois tu poder provar que √© teu!

---
Ps: ficou top
---
Poor leon
---
Nita; shaman of bears and master of fire.
---
I miss the old dynamike skin
---
I know right what were they thinking. I see no benefits to this change.
---
As all brawlers should be. Except Mortis. He needs his range back.
---
Oh HELL NAW
---
One violent hippie she electrocuted many people to death
---
It is indeed sad
---
Looks like sans
---
Al principio pens√© que era un comentario en espa√±ol, pero al final result√≥ no serlo :v
---

When u can't decide between digital art and hand art
---
Piper makes me so uncomfortable
---
Wasn‚Äôt even teaming. It was more like a sarcastic spin cuz I had my super so knew I had the dub in the bag. Anyone else do that?
---
He didn't save any power cubes for u when ur ded cos he gave up on u
