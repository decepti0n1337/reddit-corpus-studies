Jeeeeeealous!
---
---
---
Thx i understood but thx u for doing the effort
---
I totally agree, and not only that the value is amazing (shot animation, win loss animation, brawler model, and a black cat) but it's not like I'll have 80-150 gems any other day. I rarely buy gems (I've spent 20$ on brawl stars over the course of 2 years) and unless a save up a ton I wont have another chance to buy sakura or robo spike even though they're available full time. I'll probably still buy witch shelly though, so thanks.
---
i love that idea thx for sharing!
---
I want coffee emz
---
I feel like Loaded should be at the head of the table. 
---

---
In any case I don't want his stealth to be super relevant. Stealth is never healthy. I'd rather his stealth be weak, and he be compensated in other ways. 
---
Maybe his speed increase Star Power be made default and he gets a new one.
---
U're welcome !
---
r/engrish
---
His star power is SO BROKEN
---
I‚Äôd say spike. His star powers are more influential on a game to game basis and really take him to a new tier of threatening
---
Hi I'm that spike with 0 power cubes and a power drink who murdered u :D
---
I‚Äôm not sure how far you‚Äôve progressed in the game or how much you play, but I‚Äôm a maxed player who plays about an hour a day and let me tell you, once you max out, you earn gems a lot quicker. I‚Äôm also F2P so don‚Äôt fret about not having that many gems again as long as you save up and not spend them on other purchases
---
I think it‚Äôll cost at least 5000 star points ( if it were to be added to the game ) considering the price of calavera piper
---
r/MissedTheS
---
AND then you just see rockabilly Mortis smiling in the background üòÇ!
---
Feels bad
---
Yeah it' s not like cus of long range Maps heist became the less played mod, at least before well... Siege happened
---
I‚Äôm so happy
---
Same
---
Lol thanks. I actually laugh wether i face boss gene or when i get to be boss gene
---
Poor spikey boi got spooked ;w;
---
4416 out of the highest number you can count to!
---
but does she have a hydro flask?
---
Just Shelly living her best life
---
It sounds like the future
---
S t o I n k s
---
wow thats amazing!
---
On an aesthetic perspective, it looks amazing! However, I think people may be pissed about how open it is because of the huge number of open maps in brawl stars. I also think that the main issue for this will be late game when the gas closes in, as there is no way for close range brawlers to have a fair fight, perhaps add a little platform in mid for the brawlers to fight on?
---
[insert reverse letter image of the UNO]
---
We know
---
I killed a power cube 11 penny with a 4 power cube Mortis in duo showdown
---
yeah but whats the point?
---
Yeah. That happens to me as well. Even in gem grab, down to a few seconds but they just had to spin.
---
where can i get those doodles
---
Kind sir you are welcome, as my upvote wull push it to 420. Nice.
---
Aww so no shello kitty
---
yes
---
spikes a plant so he has no peepee üòè
---
Japanase style ?
---
Do you not love your sister? I‚Äôm pretty sure Leon is one of those rare good siblings.
---
Woah, that‚Äôs awesome! Do a brawl ball next :D
---
r u asking for me to do japanese style or u are saying that the draw is on japanese style bacuase is not :v
---
If you‚Äôre at decent trophy (300+), you‚Äôll be able to just pick up a powercube or two and then focus the boss over and over. You‚Äôll get at least fourth, which is enough for me. Don‚Äôt attack anyone else unless you have to. Keep attacking the boss. You‚Äôll stay 1st or 2nd but sometimes drop in my experience.
---
^what
---
You replyed my comment not on the post just so you know
---
Bruh
---
That would be perfect, but 50 is too low, I think 100 up and down would be better, matchmaking could adjust for that 
---
I mean you can have a 600 brawler and play with a friend that has 10 and matchmaking will fix that.
---
exactly wwhyy
---
I'm saying that you need to read it like a manga from right to left otherwise it doesn't work.
---
[deleted]
---
Oh sorry lol
---
I hate Leon‚Äôs new voice
---
OOF
---
Loved this so much. Your commentary made me laugh and the ending was amazing. Upvoted for originality.
---
Respect.
---
Cool!
---
No prop just telling you so the poster can see your comment
---
o yea thanks for notice
---
2 power points for Shelly... to get max Shelly
---
I may die, but i still live!
---
They hare the truth that Emz's voice lines are the worst.
---
I played with randoms and won 2/3 rounds. Only 65 points for me so far. :(

What program did you use? It's so amazing!

Well good for you

Someone's getting banned today

-Ryan_supercell probably
---
So yeah, a win is 30, and an epic win is +3 so the max you can get is 99, how does someone have 120 already?
---
Not a bug, matchmaking in power play is based on power play points not trophies
---
I was wondering the same man. I won 3 games being the star player. So no clue
---
Oh i didn't know, sorry to hear about that
---
It‚Äôs a bug, not a hacker, so it‚Äôs not really bannable.
---
nice play
---
Apparently it‚Äôs a bug‚Ä¶
---
check my post. he somehow played 4 games.
---
He must live in Australia and has sent us the future
---
In the description read the description üò≤üò≤
---
Sadly, most of my friends are terrible at the game, and I have one friend with a star power. Forced to play with at least one. Second match I got a bot. Friggin randoms
---
It's really not though
---
I don't know how I did it
---
Probably a screw up or bug on the server side
---
I mean, yeah
---
Overwhelming victory, I think I'm gem grab it's of you won before the 15th gem spawns
---
Subtle flex
---
Yeah, for sure.
---
I know
---
Lemme explain ok so if emz use her super and one enemy get inside her super emz will regain health for 200 per second when 5 enemies r inside her super she will regain 1000 health per second the health regeneration depends on how many enemies inside her super
---
This is what we need !!
---
Play all 3 of my games, 1 game with 2 guys, 1 game with randoms, and 1 game with a lower lvl friend.
---
Game with 2 we won and we almost had an epic
---
Game with randoms we won and got epic
---
Game with lower, he went Shelly and hardly ever pushed when I asked him to be agro and we lost.
---
With the data I got,1. Make sure teammates (friends or randoms) play there role, otherwise gl winning
---
2. Make sure your friends are experienced enough to understand both the map and brawler they choose to use
---
Does anyone know why one guy has 120 points while everyone else has 99, is he hacking?
---
This looks sick dude
---
This collab is awesome. Great work all of you. Maybe Supercell will consider it for next year‚Äôs Brawloween.
---
Search the forum and you‚Äôll find your answer.
---
*i knew it!!!*
---
Ok, thanks
---
How will you defeat bull in close range then
---
Looks like two people flipping each other of

I like piper's
---
I love the tick skin it's so cute
---
EMZ and El Primo teamed up before matchmaking.
---
I never heard 8 Bit Say that!
---
Some gems wont hurt
---
No one is gonna talk why the whale emoji? Mkay, anyway, awsome draw
---
Yeah I saw, he prob got bugged or glitched
---
Nope.. Crow ready to break his neck XD
---
Oh my
---
By gems I assume u mean power cubes. They appear in insane and above
---
Seems like the guy got some kind of glitch that gave him a fourth game because 120 points is 4 wins so yeah
---
Here we go again, these 'OGs' whining about this demented child of trans Barley and a fucking sniper bot. Stop bringing it up, it's just karma farming. Show some respect to the devs and the new things they bring to us.
---
If you check his stats using stats websites, it says he played 4 games. Clearly there‚Äôs a glitch
---
Don't Question It
---
I want to question it

I want to knowÔºåtooü§î

this would be nice AND handy
---
Lol I don‚Äôt give 2 shits about internet points. I was just trying to be helpful. I took a screen shot of a tweet on Twitter, if you had asked for credit I would‚Äôve given it to you, since you obviously care about getting all the internet points you can get.
---
And you‚Äôre right, I did make it sound like I looked at his log, and that‚Äôs because I did, but at that time I didn‚Äôt find a take a screenshot because I though people would know how he got those points (120) so when I saw your post I took a screenshot.
---
Sounds like some shit off The Exorcist
---
what tweet are you even talking about ? and if you really want to be helpful , you could have just linked my post.
---
This isn‚Äôt a joke, me and all my friends and all the brawl Stars youtubers always win as Mortis in brawl ball, but how tf are u gonna even get close to the safe as Mortis and damage it?
---
I got 3 wins and 2 were epic. Gotta say I got some pretty good randoms
---
I don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about I got the screen shot off of Twitter, I don‚Äôt know what post you‚Äôre talking about lol

As a F2P those are really worth it,Not wasting them on something that doesn't even help

LMFAO. It would be even more pay2win. Stupid idea

Omg I've never gotten so many powerpoints out of a single box in my life!

Just because of that Supercell will like itüòâüòâ

Hope more people see this. Well played to your team.

I had an account before the global launch but i didn't have a Supercell ID one day i got bored from the game and deleted it.Then,i heard about Global Launch and huge updates and i came back(After a few months.),i started in a new account and i am still using this account.
---
Can someone tell me how to get a brawler next to my name
---
This is amazing and I love it so much
---
Then. I. Would. Kill. Myself.
---
emz would work well as a mythic but they gotta take away another mega box ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
He made a post on it here
---
Plants can‚Äôt throw or walk
---
Its a bug even the guy himself posted it
---
Omg so gae &gt;=&lt;
---
I mean, I Say this not (only) because I get killed a lot by shellys, it's also because when I use shelly I literally obliterate everyone, Just learn how to dodge and your fine, and that's why I almost never use her, I hate her OPness
---
Matchmaking will try* to fix that
---
There are people that can Dodge really good
---
Just a feeling I got
---
I would played with my Brothers with 18k but he had already played his games
---
Seriously I don't get it

I finally got crow at 14k And 9 months too, I share your feelings

Must be a bad day for you if you're that pissy against other fellow Reddit users.
---
: )
---
Every-round-shaped attack like this increase range a lot like Frank, Pam, poco and EMZ
---
Then, I don't know
---
No. If you bait the robots to follow you for too long, the robot will have the speed of god and run toward your safe and only damage it.
---
You can‚Äôt do this online.
---
Yep. Never seen that stupid Piper before. Like she didn't react to the first scappy shots at all. Maybe she hoped that it will just stop firing by itself...
---
very epic
---
Everyone KNOWS about that Bruno guy just stop posting these
---
I played all with random and get 1 win, 1 epic win and 1 lost. Your random is just.. bad?
---
Um bug de sorte eu diria. Mas acho que v√£o fazer voc√™ ficar com 99 igual os outros

Amazing

He didn‚Äôt repost. Look at his reddit name and his in-game name you idiot.
---
Link https://crux.page.link/ysi9B
---
Thank you
---
I only got 40, 1 +30 and the rest are +5s
---
I know I thought of that too. I just took an easy brawler to Photoshop. But let's just say he hasn't got a star power or his super ready ;)
---
You write ‚ÄúdAynamike‚Äù
---
No problem
---
Already did

Not a bad day just felt weird seeing people bragging about low ass shit trophy count. Even weirder if such reply has got nothing to do with the original post or comment

Nah

99% of afk people have lags

Shut my mouth

Don't you get bonus points for being star player?

This is awsome

I shall sacrifice my head for this cat

Magically, I posted this bug 20 minutes after power play came out, and I get the least upvote. F.

We live in a society

Got 93 points just with randoms
---
Bruuuuuuuuh
---
Well 13k is actually MORE frustrating
---
But gettin poisoned once is?
---
Cool
---
I got him rank 25 before that season end with Star powers
---
They will do it after Pam got a remodel, probably next update. Just be patience and stop spamming Pam skin meme in the reddit
---
Ok
---
Im not angry...
---
Wow

I now have a clue! Why does Leon say that much ‚ÄúNita‚Äù? Cause he LOVE Nita!
---
Really good
---
Randoms are good ;)
---
Sure
---
Yeah definitely i too won all 3 mathers but i have 96 only with 2 of match as epic win after adding epic win of all 3 then too total shus be 99 how do he got 120????
---
He got my permission, thanks for the link anyway)
---
Yea true

Then join a better club, you can definitely find one where you‚Äôre in the bottom half and the majority of people are better/higher than you
---
Wat.???

of course it wasnt!!!1!!
---
For what ? I upgraded to power level 9 likes 4 days ago, these Are my first star powers
---
emz doesn't need a nerf

There‚Äôs no ‚Äúplay again‚Äù button after you finish a match. You are forced to exit to the lobby

Brawl tv would be fun but the problem we have is that if the person spectating you, knows you, then they will never shut up about that game if you make 1 mistake or misplay, so people get nervous

But it's not changed at Android too. Only changed at Google Play

Legend says that the Primo-in-a-hole exploit is still present but there are no walls to take advantage of it.

But showdown is a spin simulator

Nice art, but I don't think Rico looks good on a bear suit.

Mine is  0,1359% Lol

Ahhhhh dear ppl who downvoted me: r/woooosh
---
Primo is actually good in minecart
---
If he didn't jump with the gems
---
Fact : primo-in-a-hole exploit can't be fixed.so supercell only make the walls thinner so players can't do it
---
Use Ecosia Search Engine too, Ecosia is a search engine like Google. But Ecosia uses their money by planting trees! Ecosia.org

Maybe..but I guess they will fix it soon..

Wait hold on..

Som' not right about this

Oh my god

Even on 16000 trophies the chance of opening a star power are still 0.0482

 Dammit

I agree. The whole point of my maps are just for fun

Wutch shelly would be better

Why does every black and white drawing on this subreddit have red eyes?

i have 65 points (lost one match because of lag)

Poor pam

I got Sandy in 13k too

KO NI CHI WHACK!

Nice ;)

After about 1 year from global  release

I think he is a hacker

Totally agree

tweak the up and bottom walls a bit to prevent any 1 tile gaps

It is not for everyone to use a bug not everyone looks at reddit or other sources and it doesn't add a new feature but just is a balance thing.

I love this

This is me reversed
---
Yall are mad becous little timmy has his shelly a star power? I have 4k and im like 2 power levels away from the chance of a star power, on shelly that has 500 trophies somehow
---
It's just a bug. Chill. 21 points isn't going to make a difference to all of us at 99 or lower.

Btw, this club is active.

You know that spectators get shown for all people, so if a friend of anyone in the game spectates him, you also see 1 spectator, so if i play against you, i just need a friend watching me, so you lose your concentration and it gets easy for me

You won and still complain about this

what did he say

Some people‚Äôs didn‚Äôt get it in the last post !!!

So I guess this comment might help them !!

Excuse me but I'm just going to ignore that poco is purple

Leon will be deleted from the game because he's very overpowered

Did you get two star shelly
---
Oh sorry. Thanks for telling me.
---
üëç
---
Or when you are completely max instead of coins you get star points
---
[Really?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/dor6xg/to_late_to_post/f5q65fy/)
---
So the difference is that your parrents are so stiff they wont let you swear and you dont even type them out or are you belittling me for saying fuck?
---
You want help? I made  the post and I am friends with Miguel.
---
Don't waste your coins on powerpoints! It's harder to gain coins than powerpoints, and also, if you max Jessy you can receive free star power from boxes and Crow can wait to have his powerpoints from another free boxes.
---
I never spent my coins on powerpoints, only to max my brawlers and I'm a F2P, have 12k trophys and 10 brawlers maxed out (with both SP) and 4 with 1SP
---
aww, i can't stop barfing rainbows now
---
Solution: get an iPhoneÔøº
---
Update: I just used Spike in a game, and the exact same thing happened. My attacks would happen a second or two after I did them. I then tried Spike in a bot game, since it was way more obvious with him. The problem disappeared; something is wrong with Supercells servers.
---
I have all legendaries in brawl stars and they are maxed since a long time, but most of my legendary cards in clash royale are still lv12 (that's probably what he meant, so to get legendaries is much easier in clash royale, but to max them after getting them is faster in brawl stars)
---
Dammnnnn
---
No, the difference is that I respect other people and you don't. That is something that your parents forget taught to you
---
You don‚Äôt do it on iOS cmon man

That's a repost

then for Miguel to get those extra power play points removed.

This comment was not brought you by r/MortisGang

maybe pam was in a team with frank. it only counts the highest throphies. so you cant really blame matchmaking for a russian who thought having a player with a lvl 1 pam at the 500 throphy range as him/her was a great idea cause they will get pinned against lower-level players.

Nita is rlly good now, what are you on?
---
Thanks!
---
Hahahaa. It could be true tho
---
God that looks annoying, lol.
---
Thanks, and I know... I did it on purpose.
---
You just don't play with randoms
---
This was my first time doing this and in was so amazing to me.
---
its coming out on halloween
---
What and why?
---
High effort meme and art
---
so i tell a guy who imo doesnt deserve resoect and its bad, yet you call someone a dumbass and thats fine, fucking hypocrite
---
No dude,frank is her borfriend,it was confirmed by supercell
---
A teammate with 8 gems el primo supered onto the middle and died so we all lost out on the power play for one game :( at least I managed to still win that one
---
Ok.
---
It could if Robo was next in queue for ticketed events. Boss Fight messes with the cycle.
---
i honestly thought this was piper at first-
---
No if you have an xp road
---
No
---
Or tell your friend to stay off your account
---
It's a kid friendly game. I don't think they will.
---
Going to phase
---
Nice!
---
is favorite not favourite lmao
---
HOW IS THIS EVEN POSSIBLE?!
---
Poco is best really hope he gets another skin soon don't have serenade poco and really don't feel like getting it.
---
Iris Tara is actually really good, it changes the model a bit unlike pink piper.
---
Piper is bad for that map of gem grab :/
---
Hi.. Can i record this gameplay and post it on my Youtube channel (Lang Buaya Gaming)?
---
I will put your name in this video
---
Ok thanks but I'll need 1 more person
---
I got pink piper just because Peach
---
I feels you btw.. Just get the same gameplay just now.. Now i want to chill myself..
---
Some of us have no friends, ok?
---
Op
---
Yes
---
this is why they had to eliminate life lech
---
Well Serenade Poco is a great skin!! A bit expensive, but worth it. I wish Darryl had gotten a Pumkin skin this Brawl'O'ween. Supercell just likes giving Jessie another skin, for some reason
---
I hate new buying system of skin because WHERE IS PIRATE GENE I WANT HIM
---
Flair checks out
---
I thought this was a post on r/osugame and I was so confused

It saved my life tho

---
that Darryl does more damage than Bull and does more Damage than Darryl.
---
I did not understand that fragment, I am not an English speaker
---
It's a glitch. They got to play more than 3 times.
---
Well, you could say it is a SAFE zone. 
---
And the other one is a NO SAFE zone.
---
That means that you have 23 brawlers, so if I do 6,000/23 that is around 260 trophies for each brawler. So that either means that you don‚Äôt play much or you are not good at the game because 260 is not much(At least for me i don‚Äôt know about you).
---
Aaaah fine I give up, I dont know what else to Say anymore lmao
---
Yup, im at 12.9k missing EVERY legendary, frank, and bibi...
---
Nice job
---
Spike damage if it hits all spines (something impossible against a brawler) ends up having the highest damage in the game
---
why not
---
OK no that was my bad on the English. I meant Darryl does more Damage than Bull and Pam does more Damage than Darryl
---
!!!
---
It's impossible to get a draw in heist. You can't have the exact percentage for both teams.
---
Where at?
---
Please Tomorrow I wait that for 1 week
---
You¬¥re right.
---
I used my max Mortis(Creepy Harvest) and the three matches I lost them.
---
\*If you don¬¥t know Mortis is one of the best brawlers in the map\*
---
r/ihadastroke
---
The fact that this garbage post gets 300 upvotes is just depressing.
---
I have 15, lost all matches cause of trash randoms. I don‚Äôt wanna describe them...
---
Goated
---
How this even happening?
---
Too true
---
Piper Calavera was Just an excuse to add female Poco into the game. Don‚Äôt @ me
---
Before watching I thought you were going to show yours and the other teams safe both being destroyed at the same time, if so that would have been cool. But yeah, as the other guy said, this is a common occorence because the draw is not done on the actual safe health, but rather the percentage of the health (Not tryna spread hate, but hope this helped).
---
Skins dont affect gameplay, theyre literally there for cosmetic purposes.
---
Just like you I‚Äôve climbed up to around that range almost exclusively with randomly only, I recently joined a club two days ago and just asked if anyone in there wanted to power play. That‚Äôs really all there is to it. You don‚Äôt know if they‚Äôll preform as well as you‚Äôd like but having a team comp you‚Äôre happy with helps.
---
Best artwork I‚Äôve seen yet üëè
---
I wonder how this "map" will actually play
---
what is the problem IN DOING DAMAGE TO THE ROBOT AND IGNORE THE REST OF THE PLAYER
---
Let me guess, cavern churn and feast or famine?
---
im at 12k and im missing tara and all legendaries
---
Well I‚Äôm usually on around now everyday.
---
That is amazingü§£
---
Everyone has their own definition of having fun. Some only have fun when they win, some are casuals who don‚Äôt really care they‚Äôre just here to kill time. You need to understand every person has a different perspective on things. Hope this helps.
