T√° n√©, mais voltando ao assunto, gostou da ideia?
---
Before climbing above 500 was dead easy I got 7th (around 600trophies or so) because the other 6 guys were teaming. 
---
No full dyna bs like you see in maps like this one, 6 regular dudes who just decided to hate me. 
---
They didn't even start killing each other afterwards they waited for the zone to get small and at some point someone decided to shoot.
---
Don‚Äôt underestimate Mike‚Äôs beard

This is beautiful

No u

Y u use an old screenshot of bounty

Yeah I will say that too there r some game modes that I don't like playing but every game mode is unique in it's own way
---
oh. i understand now. i'm with you
---
At most I only see like 3 dynas in one game, let alone teamers. I don't know what server you're playing on, but jeez, that's gotta suck.

Ok m8 just letting you know that this was a post from coach cory meme review.
---
You may have changed it (you did) so it's slightly different but you should probably delete this.
---
Yea but was it almost max and did you do nothing wrong?
---
I‚Äôm just hoping they add some skins for brawlers that don‚Äôt have any.
---
Ha ha omg, so funny, you've achieved comedy
---
/s
---
yes!!! or 3 maybe
---
Yes
---
Probably, even though that was my name before i changed it. I'll go with that one, or try to come up with another original username.
---
  You see, when i created ‚ÄúMageddone‚Äù there was no google search results for it. That's why it's cool
---
Lol.
---
No it deserved to be killed clearly.  Was very dull a lacked any unique aspects to keep people playing
---
Come check out my profile, I posted an eight kill dynamike win, that I couldn't post here.
---
Did you post this on all three subreddits?
---
He didn‚Äôt make it just so u know

What a stupid comment.

Wait hold up, I think I'm one of your ingame friends

I dont get it but upvote fore effort
---
You have achieved comedy in a wrong way
---
ngl you were bad in the first half, but then you got way better! This comes from someone with 11K trophies so no need to take this to heart
---
Ibh I saw so many posts with that title
---
Mines sitting at .29. I just hope the next brawler is a trophy road one again so my chance stays up
---
Well you have one and had enough gold to level these brawlers up. I don‚Äôt have any legendaries at 12,700 trophies and 28 gold
---
Thanks you crow? Not to be a dick, but you should remove that ‚Äús‚Äù

Don‚Äôt ask for upvotes. Even if you want supercell you see this, why not just report it in the actual game. Seems like dumb logic but maybe that‚Äôs just me.
---
It took me months to notice that you could tap on your brawler to change it.
---
Pam will heal him)
---
It's so frustrating to bet lots of tickets on robot rumble and find a random using bad brawlers like Tick, Piper or Dyna.

Omg, I literally posted this when I used to play brawl stars and you just reply it after months lol, but yeah you‚Äôre an OG.

So cute!

Mortis can be used very effectively in Brawl Ball. The problem is, most people *fucking suck with mortis*, so they dont use him effectively and make it a 2v3.

Why you playing with randoms in Power Play

why do you have fortrash

Why?

uwu
---
Tha fact that you are moving around the safe and not doing the max damage pisses me off,just stand still god dammit
---
So who's Ultimate Kars in this case
---
What did u push her in?

I understand about the winning part, but if they want to they should do both parts. (Not gaining trophies/lose trophies) when your internet is down.

Long leg bit is not real. He cant hurt you.

Long leg bit:

Hey! I can play with you! I'm at 15.2k and my tag is #92PL8LLU. What's your name? (to add the right person)
---
Can I play with you?
---
I mean, if they don‚Äôt give it for winning while disconnected, they should not cost trophies when losing.

It's probably because that barley was shit at aiming

Is this asking for a name?
---
Well atleast you get a discount version of that good skin anyone will take that discount skin over no skin any day
---
No ?
---
You can grind 150 XP in like 10 matches if you get star player every match. How about just letting the brawlers come out of boxes like they‚Äôre meant to be? Putting them in the trophy road would take away the whole point of being a legendary, if you want to add brawlers to the trophy road just make them trophy road brawlers.

Its rockabilly mortis..not rockability

What the heck? I already made something like this around 14 days ago. Seriously, I‚Äôm not lying. You can look in my profile right now. Still good though, honestly.

Go onto the main page of the sub Reddit click on the vertical elipses button on the top right corner then click on "change user flair" and then you can select your favourite brawler and he/she can be next to you profile (only on this sub reddit of course)

Im waiting

Oof

Yeah just go do something else, they'll probably take a while

Sounds like skill based matchmaking but with extra steps
---
The noobs think jessie is op so buffing her is kinda hard when you have people like these. I think they should buff her damage to 1260 like penny . penny is really good with her new damage
---
This would be could but then some players would just rate everyone bad. And some players won‚Äôt even mind rating others.

10/10 for graphicsüëåüëåüëå

well that is pretty scum of you for bm'ing in front of them while you camped in a bush.
---
My best was 22 sec with my power 1 rank 23 Poco. My teammates just disappeared, and left me to defend the safe, but with 660 dmg, I couldn't really hold off any robot.
---
no
---
Add Emz's super as well.
---
You get 20 tokens every level up
---
Oh man, yep, it happens
---
This is acually a very bad idea,but creative non the less
---
Try getting all brawler to rank 35 that a 100% truly maxed
---
That artwork isn't that good as compared to the Leon one. Of course more would upvote for Leon.
---
Well that makes 2 of us
---
Sorry, your post has been removed. You need an account that's at least 7 days old to make a submission here.

Didn't u see NSFW

Yes please. I'm actually really freaking thirsty
---
2k players with all legendaries: "Amateur"
---
Why poco looks soo durpy
---
Wow, uh- all I can say is
---
F for the YouTubers.
---
Oh grow up ffs, he spun like 2 times.  He made a really smart play and was just spinning at them to say "gotcha" . I don't understand why kids get so upset over someone spinning, yeah it can be annoying but scum? It's a game don't take it so seriously  .
---
Wow so useful who cares? Inma need 80 more if I want a box to even have a chance to get something useful so exp is practically useless
---
Looks cool but LINE would never allow this, sorry
---
Why such post got 181 upvotes whereas some people try their best and their posts get less upvotes
---
Well,my problem is not the Leon artwork,its the fact that the person who posted the leon artwork isn‚Äôt the original artist,and he gets more upvotes than the actual artist who made the sandy art.
---
It's not a fishing stick it's a freaking fishing dick
---
Just an example,there are many more artworks that go unnoticed!
---
Ok
---
Exactly!Finally someone who understands me :)
---
How do you talk to a real employee?! It's always the fcking bot!!! I've been trying to work this out for 1 month! Someone help me please
---
I didn't mention about a smart play, I mentioned bm'ing. I agree, it was a smart play, but the spinning was just unnecessary.
---
Naming yourself Werewolf Leon
---
that makes 0 sense
---
i also got first with poco in a power play lone star match xD
---
Ur bad too dude u should see his super ready and gonn explode near boxes andd ur healt 4000 its enough for normal goal
---
Or dont have to deal with randoms most of the time
---
There should be room for report system btw..
---
I am in this picture and i don't like it . 
---
&amp;#x200B;

P. S  No legendary on three accounts i play on . Just  bad luck i guess

Also she's probably a typical teen who listens to k pop. Ironic since she probably thinks that boys dancing and singing is a career lmao

And?

You did ruin your 999

Specially when you get the same bad randoms 3 times in a row without ever pressing play again
---
Top 1 banned üëè
---
Irony at its finest.
---
No
---
I think it could go back in time
---
I find jessie better because her star power makes her turret really affective. Pens seems only good in heist and maybe siege where her turret can do damage to the safe/Ike
---
You can allways disconect and win trophyes without doing anything (that's why)
---
Ye but u didnt have to be so rude
---
They should buff him not let him slowly rot as he keeps getting nerfed.
---
How do you put these images on the meme?
---
Im honest. You‚Äôre overforcing it. Makes you look 14, dont do that
---
Why? I would like to hear some Gene sort of VA for Spike
---
Im not even 14 loll
---
I said that it makes you look 14, not that you are
---
About 21 brawlers. 19 brawlers need points and the other 2 are missing Star Powers.
---
Oh so it makes me older ok
---
they are the same picture
---
Surprise surprise!
---
I have 9 brawlers with maxed power points. 2 of the brawlers are missing Star Power.
---
Yes.I will take down my post once this artist‚Äôs work gets 200+ upvotes.That‚Äôs all i want to see :)
---
No, i dont think i will.
---
No he is fine he doesn‚Äôt need any buffs or nerfs  he is fine supercell nerfed him cuz he has a REALLY BIG use rate and win rate he is fine and think I reddit users need to kinda shut their shitty mouth no offence
---
No, it was necessary
---
Did u even see my yt profile pic
---
No, luckely i didnt. Maybe you should just stick to not making videos if youre just going to overforce it
---
Maybe give him an extra 1 or 2 seconds invisibility time
---
Play again with different randoms or you can just go to the main screen and just click play
---
SmoothIClay I suppose

Another proof that this sub is fucking trash.
---
Penny got a small buff before which makes her stronger than Jessie. Ima just say that Penny turrets is better than Jessie
---
You are wrong and here's why:
---
Firstly, 3v3 games have a lot of factors that count in to why a person wins so it would not matter if a person had only 1 good factor.
---
Secondly, here are the factors that count in to why a person wins: the brawler he picked for what gamemode and map, his teammates, his application of the knowledge he knows in brawlstars and his amount of knowledge of brawlstars.
---
I mean, the kids in ur class that are bullying you are probably meaner, im just telling you the truth here mate
---
i have no idea why but this why does this girl literally give YDE  a view if she hates gamers i cant relate
---
You are super lucky
---
Yeah lmao normally i would do that but I like pushing a lot and then seeing something like plus 300 trophies
---
An app?

I know right!

If you disconnected and reconnected at the right time, like 5 seconds before the match ends, and you won, you‚Äôll actually get trophies! There‚Äôs this one time when I was playing bounty and I lagged, so I closed the app. Later I tried to open it again and it was the last few seconds of the match. Found out that we actually won the match and I was the STAR PLAYER. Free trophies for me :) I love you random Artificial Intelligence who played as me.
---
If i go to support and say "how about giving us free legendary on trophy road?" Then they would say "nice idea, why don't post it on reddit?"

Finally, we can now see the news button. It annoyed me so much that it was blank.

So will it be strong for you if it gets health as much as Primo? Meh.
---
"We've lost some brawler models"
---
13 brawler models were removed
---
Purely epic. I can‚Äôt even do it with my maxed crow with both star powers.
---
I think it should be 0.5% for each star power you can currently obtain.
---
No it's not

Here's what I found for you:[https://youtu.be/\_glu2rF\_M7o](https://youtu.be/_glu2rF_M7o)
---
That's an insane achievement! Well done.
---
Me too, but only with star points
---
Durian darryl should be a skin available during august 31 1957
---
Oof I only have spike that's fore the link. :p
---
Woah man!
---
Thanks man!
---
Sure man!
---
Bye man!
---
(I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm writing, neither do I know what I‚Äôm doing with my life.)
---
Back then 500 trophies is like 700 trophies nowadays. 1000 trophies is huge
---
Oh God... It's awesome
---
I think they should leave it there. You have to work to get star powers and to max your brawlers and if the drop rate was higher it would ruin the fun in getting a star power out of a box at random times.

If you take a look at the channel we don't promise anything. We never have and never will, we just make videos for people to enjoy.
---
Dyna, mortis,colt, piper and brock are cooler now
---
Quality gamer moment
---
Perfection.
---
For players under 4K trophies only
---
Why Spike has no voice?
---
Ok, but this title just sounds like you bpaming 'em
---
Hay day: You guys are even in this meme?
---
Both the Shellies used their supers.
---
The fact that EPIC promotes such videos is tragic.
---
Its not for free its for good players xd
---
Wait for xp road and you will get
---
What
---
How??? Lol
---
Ok so a cactus in real life moves and shoots spikes ?
---
Brock:hey wait for me
---
I know
---
Man I really liked old bo and Brock
---
Maybe piper
---
And elprimo ain‚Äôt thicc why isn‚Äôt there any thicc
---
When supercell will fix it?
---
Author's note: Sorry for the guys who waited for the finished artwork :') I was out of Reddit for a while because some health and personal problems. So I wasn't drawing lately.
---
What about El Primo and Bo?
---
I think you have to go to your mail box and there should be skin donation from supercell
---
That‚Äôs the main reason why people hate the mode
---
Haha yep, idiots always use shelly in boss fight and robo rumble. And it's usually the 5k noobs
---
Now we just need to send this to Supercell and wait.
---
Crandy
---
It's not a Bug and it's totally normal to have 2 Same brawlers on The same team when playing with randoms.
---
Also.. thanks!
---
Your super happened , its just your WiFi/ the game that lagged , you can see the enemy Leon stunned showing the super wasn't stopped
---
I packed crow on my 2nd account at 600 trophiesüíÄ
---
Most of them deserved it though. Like Bo‚Äôs. His new one is so much better.
---
Hi i am duck
---
Smash land:crying In forgoten
---
Lol the same speed
---
10 coins for 1 gem is... Cheap, I think. Like, 30 gem big box for 300 coins? At least 450.
---
My crush:
---
Which one is cool
---
Every single of 'em: /\\
---
l
---
No I see an error, trust me I have no friends, randoms are only okay in brawl ball, every other mode ABSOLUTELY USELESS
---
Big box for 300 coins? Bruh I don't even have coins to upgrade my level 3 brawlers...
---
LolüòÇ
---
I hope they do something about it
---
It's just a copy of werewolf Leon but white?
---
The fact that these modes show up in powerplay makes me want to die
---
Agreed. CR gets a new one every MONTH!
---
Thanks!
---
Better idea
---
Extra life spams you with full ammo 
---
When you get killed by 8 bit with extra life you also can get 1 more extra life but it will spa you with full ammo and health but only once and the respawn shield will be 1 second longer than the normal ones (only for solo events and duo events for 3v3 will respawn you without ammo 
---
Also once per game)
---
Also damage per bem decreased to 403
---
Delet this
---
It happend to me too.
---
Whenever someone gets disrespectful in takedown I make it my mission to deny them space and ultimately kill them all match. They won't do it again next match.
---
*PeTiTIoN tO aDD ThiS AbiLITy to BrAwL STARs!*
---
Feel you, im 9k too and ive never gotten la legendary from a megabox
---
Fix your god damn bot I saw this a while ago
---
bruh it‚Äôs a game, of course it moves. Giving him a voice however will ruin his silent type personality
---
yeah this can be abused
---
I think a better idea is make it so you keep all the ammo you had when you died then respawning with that ammo, since when you die from a bull in a bush you have no chance even with extra life
---
I like it. You are the man
---
I'm the Darryl*
---
Man, you just fixed the bug instead of supercell bois
---
Idk man
---
Yooo, me too) My Darryl is at 1006=] Congrats!.
---
I had to wait until 13,5k, I made a 100+ boxes pack opening, I just opened the first and got Crow
---
I think he got banned from this subreddit
---
6:30* 
---
You can get 6:00 minutes even with this combo when it's underleveled

Haha i get it why shes a outlaw.

Did you get spike before getting the mythics?
---
You serious ??? You seriously didn‚Äôt watch the vid to say that lmao. I didn‚Äôt say that for every Russian: ¬´¬†thanks to these two Russians¬†¬ª mean ¬´¬†two Russians¬†¬ª
---
Hay Day *cry*
---
Lol I have 1 legendary and all the mythics and my chance is 0.1510.And thats just idea (sorry if someone already did this)
---
Had to try it lol
---
I agree.
---
Yeah, I got rares, super rares, then spike, then epics, and then mortis
---
Brawl stars not for kids? U kiddin me? All the supercell games' target audience are kids. Explains their profanity filter, never swearing or dark jokes in their vids, ban for swearing in clan chat etc. Why? Because kids are also more likely to spend on their greedy microtransactions and are much more competitive in nature than adults.
---
I always  get a fucking shelly in every pp match and when i see one i know they are dumb
---
Dude you are completely missing the point. He‚Äôs free to play.
---
Lemmme give you a good 10 seconds of a round of applause üëèüèª
---
whats ur trophy is it 15.9k
---
No. This is completely and objectively true
---
Master is easy. I always play mortis in boss fight from normal to master and always win. But when it reaches insane I get serious.
---
Ty
---
Well then that‚Äôs correct and avoidable. What were you even trying to say?
---
Which one? First or second model?
---
Gem deals, daily power point deals. He can buy those
---
While the spawns are luck based, avoiding death is a solution
---
15 969
---
Because fire crow and boom box Brock are far better and I can't put them both on the same level
---
Okay this might seem awk. Just a while ago i was watching super smash bros on youtube and i find the map's style and the image very similar.
---
Star point shelly
---
Who was released before Leon?
---
don't ask for any crow nerf cause supercell will make him star power dependent just like piper
---
Because robo Mike has a chicken on it so it must be better
---
Perfect answer
---
I want to but I'm not making a tier for 1 skin
---
Top model?
---
Yes it is
---
thats a mix of luckiness and unluckiness, some people dont even have a leggy at 15k, while some people (like me) got 2 leggies at 9k (but only 1 mythic)
---
Thank God lol
---
Frank tweeted 2 months ago that, to be in the top 1% in Brawl Stars, you needed ~14,000 trophies. So no, not even close to 35%. It's just that this sub is filled with high trophies players
---
Edit : I wrote 40,000 instead of 14,000 smh
---
Wow!
---
You unlocked crow! Can't say the same.

I don't think so

No way really? Didn't know. He gotta be in S tier now

:o

oh look, a guy on reddit with 140 trophies.

First guy would live a lonely life
---
I just go for the other player when the shield is on, and not always depends on the situation
---
You really thought they made the name from that?
---
This makes me soft, like it's very hard to believe that all this happened one year ago, it really feels like yesterday. I can still remember the time when I got my first legendary or when I got Piper (my favourite brawler)
---
im 14.6k now and i got all brawlers (bought mortis, bought gene and bought leon)
---
At least you got a star power
---
I bet you are fun at parties
---
Its not my match i watched someones match
---
See ya in top of all time
---
Yeah this is getting pretty annoying I spent like this one time like five hours making a character from another video game but what if he was in BrawlStars and it looked very good too but then I only got five and yet some how a low effort meme and A DEAD ONE got like 2.1 K or something
---
*DUDE SEREUSLY*
---
:D
---
Leon is really fucking weak without his healing star power anyways so its already ok if his star power seems a bit op
---
Oh man you barely did it, so lucky
---
And that's because most of russian players are little kids. Can confirm, I am russian.
---
My statement still stands
---
Can agree,remember what happened to cr,legendaries there are no weightless cuz of free stuff.
---
There are free brawlers called trophy road brawlers. Legendaries are not meant to get on the trophy road.
---
It happened to me too 1 week ago. 
---
Now is all ok. Wait and it will resolve
---
yeahhh, skins dont fkin count, bo and crow are bare feet

Yea but this will be for the final reward I mean they should give something good

u/YusufYedek u/0Argali

saved the  legendary picture of a legendary brawler

BEAR WITH ME

unless you play a lot of heist

Pretty solid concept, but I don't think supercell will have gems on an xp road sadly :/

---
And you forgot the remodels of the brawlers.
---
Maybe not a legendary, but maybe a box with a LOT of gold, maybe like, 3 star powers, perhaps a normal 1k token multiplier and a brawler that can only be obtained there, not really a legendary, but sort of a final thropy road brawler.
---
I find the whole legendary thing... weird, considering that brawlers are categorized as legendary based on how unique they are and not really how strong they are, Im pretty sure Emz could be considered one, but noone does because she is free
---
This is simply when each brawler were introduced
---
Like it but what is she?
---
Great info!
---
What?
---
wdym who won...its a draw
---
Thanks !
---
Another Jessie rager? C‚Äômon guys, maybe in +900 trophies it‚Äôs kinda bad, but, for me, it was the easiest brawler to climb up to rank 25. Maybe the problem is not Jessie, is your skill
---
It's literally the same thing that happens in brawl stars üòÇ
---
Band aid in a nutshell
---
Mouth is not good.

Good idea
---
Thanks)
---
I tried her a couple times before, and it wasn‚Äôt as great as expected. In hindsight she could have been thrown into C tier/might work. The knockback could definitely help, especially in the late game!

Hey! Nice man here. Could you give me your Supercell ID and credit card information so i can get you sally leon FOR FREE????

(Please dont this is a joke dont do that please please please 100%legit no joke potato microwave idk)

That's a bit too furry for me

Go have an eyesight check

I love the skins and the 49 boxes for 49 gems.

Whoops forgot about her. She would be in the overpowered side btw
---
This does put a smile to my face

The ultimate buff

He‚Äôs so fucking slowww

Thank god it's december

The stat was for active accounts

And before it Shelly used Shell shock on him.

They've done this before.

I would be happy if I got this Star power.
---
How do you think they should rework him?
---
Right, but was there a given explanation as per why?  Token doublers modify the amount recieved
---
Haha. I'm literally dieing in laughter. You're such a dedicated comedian. Take my gold.
---
WTH is this
---
200 iq tactic
---
Range doesn‚Äôt really help as much in this mode, especially when the yellow bots spawn in. Once they‚Äôre on the map, it‚Äôs better to have enough hp to tank for the safe than to attack at a safe distance. At around the 6:15 mark, the bots will most likely overwhelm your team, and the goal should be to stall out the massive amounts of bots, or to slowly chip them down. This is where the extra 2-3k hp can make a pretty big difference; even if you live for 3 extra seconds, that‚Äôs most likely going to allow a teammate to revive, which will further increase your time.
---
lol just beacuse u don't heve friend doesn't mean everyone doesn't
---
Thats why i thought about making it a trophy competition rather than having to hope that youre teammates are on so you can go thru with the battle. Everyone can get on and play on their own time. The trophies you have earned in battle are recorded next to your name in the club battle screen so you can see you and your teammates trophy contributions. I just feel like it would be easier this way but a way for the clubs to actually play against each other would be awesome. I just cant figure out how it would be coordinated.
---
cause mythic is "RED"
---
Were back in 2017
---
I just checked. I have hog rider carl and can confirm he does not have toes. He has one central foot.
---
lmao
---
Get smarter dude and stop posting stupid things that are obviously
---
If they they change incinery to dps on the brawlers. I think that would be a great buff to him.
---
It ended so fast I felt bad for the other team :(
---
Still doesnt work for me without that stupid trick
---
Crow: ‚ÄúYou guys are getting nerfs?‚Äù Was what I was expecting when I saw the thumbnail had Crow in the last panel.
---
Needs to happen please
---
Wont happen. Like many people including myself. I have all the brawlers...
---
Oh my ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
100% calculated
---
Leon could have ran infront of jeanes
---
I get scare of high power up person
---
So you are here to judge me about posting something that i need an opinion of while there are like a thousand more posts out there being pointless such as brawler fusions and all that other unnecessary bs?
---
Now this, *this* is beautiful
---
Because i have and had all brawlers when i finished trophy road, i should get 700 gems
---
I suppose they could also make it so that only brawlers who have a certain trophy amount can compete, for example only brawlers with 400+ trophies just to stop people who may be better at the game from making new accounts to play against easier competition or what i would call poaching lol.
---
Yeah, frank super stops all supers even on the opposite side of the map
---
Oh No! I lost 0.2 accuracy!
---
You know the would be inverted buff to sandstorm if chances to miss happens.
---
Aw man

It's not supposed to stop his teammate super...

uhhhh

no...not really.

idk why but i think it looks weird. prob just me tho
