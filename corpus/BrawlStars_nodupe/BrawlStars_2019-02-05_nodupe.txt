Nice concept! She seems a little too basic for a mythic though, maybe make her an epic probably. I'm also concerned about the flashbang, how would work on the person who gets affected? Are they not able to see a part of their screen or what? Anyways love the concept!
---
Olha... achei um BR ksksk
---
They are lol we have a whole clan of just people with bot and a number after 
---
you can still see the raft meme right b4 it switches to brawl stars. Anyway i like it, you should have done this in island tho and rolled around the sides

Ok. Stuff like that happens. Someone makes something and has no clue someone else made it.

Who gave this guy gold? Let me join in lol

It's spelled S T R A T E G Y!

For blindness effect, 90% of your screen turns white. That remaining 10% is the significant amount of opacity in the corners of the screen.
---
Sometimes i do. Its easy trophies. But i usually do it for brawlers that suck at showdown.
---
if you double the token doubler, it gives 20 brawl boxes for only 50 gems!! That's insane! Right now it's fine since it gives 10 brawl boxes for 50 gems. Also, a brawl box is worth 10 gems each so already the token doubler gives a lot of value. 
---
nice art, but i don't think samurai fits to tara, i mean... a samurai uses a sword as weapon. And tara will not throw 3 swords :3 so nah better call this a fan art.

Oh alright.

I find it sad how you're assuming I team.
---
No, I do not team, but if you play TF2 I'm sure you will be able to see how this is similar to being a "friendly".
---
This was sure, a lobby full of teamers in solo showdown, but this was different, everyone was teaming, everyone was friendly, nobody was attacking anyone, that seems to be a one in a million chance of happening.
---
I think you should have savored the rare moment, and should've let the others do the same.
---
You were selfish in ruining their fun for a few trophies, no matter what you say, that is a fact.
---
Lol thats why i hate randoms
---
Perfect 
---
why

They could do like overwatch does and create animated shorts with life, I think the style in this game could really fit Pixar like animated shorts

Well it went global so I was right

I‚Äôm waiting for the same thing lol. Those mega boxes will be much more valuable if I can get him 
---
no worries\^\^ the idea is to also make the doubler apply for star token so the value gap between normal and big boxes gets smaller
---
You can talk all nice, still your saying ‚Äújoin the team‚Äù every single match at 450+ brawler trophy‚Äôs look like this. in skull creek you will either see all dyna‚Äôs/franks/mortis.  certain maps. are for certain brawlers. although you can‚Äôt seem to understand that it‚Äôs SOLO showdown. So no, it‚Äôs no fact.  ‚Äúruin the game‚Äù yet your the one here that would have joined the team.  i‚Äôd rather backstab ;)

I like the concept, but make the super a thrown barrier (passable by himself and allies), so that if dragged back to middle, it cancels. I think the bottles shouldn't do very much damage, but the middle does most.

---
I disagree. I play a lot of Gem Grab with randoms only, and between 0-300 trophies I have more wins than losses.  
---
Like any Arena-style or Moba-style game, it doesn't matter if someone leaves or gets disconnected, you will still lose points. This is because the system could be abused otherwise.
---
Now you might think "How can it be abused?". Well, depending on how high Trophys you have it will be easier to sync with someone to start a match at the same time. Depending on the time of the day and Trophy level this is possible. This could then be exploited by having one sacrificing trophies on their Brawlers if the match goes sour, so that their friend can keep climbing the ladder with their specific Brawler.
---
As many threads and comments before, there's 2 solutions for this:
---
* You become a better player and carry your team with Brawlers that excel on the Gem Grab/Heist map.
---
* Don't play with randoms. Play with people from your Club or find a Discord server and find people there to play with that are around your skill level.
---
When you lose a 3v3 game, regardless if it is with randoms or with people you know, instead of finding excuses to why you lose (e.g. thinking that your teammates were bad, or that someone left, or went afk etc) you should instead reflect on how you could've played better instead.

lol, i had some itunes credit and i spent it all on the Brock and Colt one. idk, but i just don't like the darryl skin.

I'm lagging a ton a lot right now. Don't think it's your phones fault or your connection

this was my exact thought a long time ago. i quit the game for almost 9 months just after the landscape update. i come back after global and unlock frank on my first box. hmmmü§î

Well you always can use the movement lock, maybe it can help

I hope you get banned from reddit.

Brawl ball is the worst in this regard. Dying on the offensive end can be quite the advantage in a counter attack and if u kill everyone in your own ur even more fucked bc once u get to their goal they will all be immune/full health/full attacks
---
I think the spawn time as well as the invincibility period definitely need to be tweaked. The time you wait before spawning is just a little too fast and the amount of time bad players are rewarded with invincibility is frustratingly long. I don't think, however, that the damage you do should be nerfed during the invincibility period as I believe it would make it too hard to get out of a spawn trap.
---
the thiccness is spreading. first they got rico now they came for primo
---
But the extra win on your profile

My answer wasn't even long. It was constructive on both giving you an answer why IQ test would be mute for games, and what solutions there are available for you if you feel that it's impossible to win with randoms.

My son is so disappointed!! We had some kind of Gem purchasing problem which extended beyond the time window for purchasing Leon.
---
iPhone 6, iOS 12.1, updated game - January 2019 patch (12/29).
---
My son has been wanting Leon ever since he learned about the game and finally this weekend, he noticed that Leon was available for \~575 (I can't remember exactly, but it was the US version fo the game special sale this past weekend (feb 2-3). We decided we needed a $9.99 purchase of gems, plus a $19.99 purchase of gems, and my son broke his piggy bank to "pay me back" to get Leon. I made the first purchase, the $9.99 one, and we got the spinning clock saying "transaction pending" and we waited several hours for it to go through and appear. Then, we went to make the second purchase, and the clock started spinning - and CONTINUED to be unavailable until AFTER the Leon discount special was available, and now it's gone!
---
Sometime after Leon offer disappeared, the clocked stopped spinning and the gems from the second purchase didn't' even appear in our balance, and as still not there.
---
I checked my Apple iTunes store, as suggested by SuperCell in game support, and both transactions were listed as completed... but that's not so. One of them never appeared in the game.
---
The main issue, is that no matter whose fault it is, or whether Apple did or didn't approve payment (we checked everything by the way, my account is current and there is a valid payment source registered with Apple), even if the gems HAD come through to our account, they didn't come through before the Leon discounted special was available - now he's not available for purchase on the game anywhere.
---
It's not about the money, it's about getting a Leon brawler for my kid. Can we work this out somehow? Again, happy to pay the money, just don't know how to get our new coveted brawler.
---
thank you for considering how to help us. I don't use Reddit that often, but I'll try and check back here at least a couple times a day to see if there are responses. I'll try to find a notifications setting so I'll get pinged if there's a reply, though, again, not used to this system.
---
Thank you.
---
What aboutthe players without Darryl?
---
ok, if you're going to complain about this, stop it. i know that some of them doesn't make sense or sounds right to you, but i just want to relax a little bit after losing some trophies üò™ 
---
Jessie looks creepy even in the game. Check it out in the brawlers section.
---
What is even
---
kinda true, but you have to admit, he is still the best brawler in the game
---
Avoid long range brawlers, they will just delete you from existence

Trophy road brawler not a legendary brawler anymore 
---
I got him yesterday and I‚Äôm already 400 trophies with him advice I would give is don‚Äôt bite of more than you can chew and be aware of your surroundings (don‚Äôt get to close to bushes unless you know it‚Äôs clear) also stay persistent in showdown try to annoy them into another player to finish them ( with this method I‚Äôm able to kill bulls Leons and other tanks even without baiting them into another brawler). Brawler to avoid would be any with the ability to strike through object like poco Nita frank Tara and primo and one more thing don‚Äôt get to close unless their low then go for the kill. Hope you have as much fun with him as I do üëç

It had slightly more rate, Im not in that situation, I obtained my most liked brawler spike and then I got 6 legendary elixir before darryls update
---
how did u get a flair.
---
yes i agree. in my opinion level 5 is when he is usable. when you get him to level 5 you should play him on stormy plains and hot maze where all the throwers are. if you play him on other maps you should get 1 or 2 power cubes and hide in a bush. if someone comes dash away and hide in an other bush. with mortis you could try teaming so you could let your teammate do all the work.
---
to check bushes you should dash close to bait, then dash away
---
Being a hero doesn't always mean saving lives.

So he will summon a lion right? Coooool

oof sorry
---
"Gotta Ketchum All!"
---
Keep in mind‚Äîyou can get away with back stabbing at least once per game. One or two people back stabbing each game introduces the risk of back stabbing. Teaming is built on trust, and increasing the risk of backstabbing is what breaks down that trust in the long run.
---
Sure, you won‚Äôt be able to do that more than once or twice a game, but you don‚Äôt have to worry about building a negative reputation among teamers because we are all strangers to one another, and after 300 trophies, that is especially true, as we no longer have our names identified in game. 
---
There is a ton of incentive to team, which is why it‚Äôs difficult to break this thing, but it takes a lot of fed up people to finally get the ball rolling.

My problem with clash Royale you stop playing it for a month and then it is impossible to get back into playing it as their are new cards that you should have at your trophy range but they are new so you don't but with brawl stars new characters can get added stuff get re worked but at the end of the day it is mostly the same clash Royale always changing so you constantly have to play it that's why I stopped 
---
Well if you are an idiot then you wont understand so shut up and dont comment hate on my post

Too health,too damage!

He was never big brawler LOL

i dont even have leon
---
At another‚Äôs expense
---
wont be enough
---
So true :/
---
Honestly mortis is only really an option in showdown brawl ball and gem grab that's why he is bad almost every other character can have some success in every game mode except mortis he needs some sort of buff maybe a range buff but the range he does damage in stays the same and maybe a speed or reload as well
---
yeah boiiiiiiiiiiiiiii

I probably won't get gene but hopefully spike or crow I don't have them yet and I would love them I'm literally just missing all the legendaries
---
Lol nobody plays him in showdown because of the sheer amount if shotgunners and how slowly he destroys boxes and he isnt even viable in Brawl Ball anymore because of the new patch where kicking the ball consumes ammo
---
This is fucking hilarious

I thought the Bull charging into Colt's blazing bullets should be something in an action movie.

well played buddy

how many trophies and are you free to play?

Usually lose some more because I tilt hard lol. Lost 50-60 trophies with Jessie today, but after taking a break I got on with a friend and got the trophies back.

And nobody will get fucking HURT!

I do understand that no trophies are awarded to people that enter the match and purposely exit to let the bot play, but i didn't do that. The game crashes due to bugs from the update and I'm "penalized" wth?

‚Üëthis

They can just do it like fortnite and we can report people who team.

Yeah but with most brawler reworks have come remodels too.
---
Shh... ü§´

# I JUST REALIZED THERE IS ALREADY A MAP NAMED THIS LOL, JUST ENJOY THE MAP

That doesnt make them the same thing that just means they did both at the same time

well, one of the characters from (at least from what i've seen) part 5 has a stand that works like a turret so yes

Also so so stupid by the middle Piper, it was pretty obvious what was gonna happen
---

---
Really?? Brawlers had lore?? Jeez I started like in December and I really wanted some backstory on them... Had no idea that this existed and it was removed.
---
May I use this
---
I love it
---
I like the idea.... but teamers would be trading Honor points like bit coin. They have no honor and deserve no points. So this is a no for me unless you can devise a fix for that.

It is pretty hard. If you're good with the character, take them into 3v3 gamemoses, you'll have more success there.

Try ranking up your brawlers evenly. Just playing bull on showdown is going to hurt your skill/knowledge of the game when playing other brawlers or even learning maps. I find it a lot more enjoyable to rank up my brawlers evenly, that way I play with everyone I have, and I‚Äôm at about the same skill level with each brawler. 
---
This is imbalance brawler
---
Well, if you ask Reddit, everyone will say buy tickets and token doublers with gems but i am buying mega boxes every time they appear on sale tab for 60 gem. ƒ∞ think you should buy it. But dont buy it for 80 gem. Buy it when they are on sale.
---
Congrats you.
---
I have all my brawlers at 12-14, but just can‚Äôt seem to reach past 16
---
I‚Äôll try that, thanks! 
---
Nice
---
Yes, teamer in solo SD is killed :))
---
Well of course it will be more difficult as you rank up because you are playing higher trophy level brawlers which usually equates to higher skill. 
---
yes. and his skin don't have effects
---
You can't be serious... Do you guys seriously think this is acceptable...

For sure. Just seemed like a giant leap from being around 14-15 :)
---
 thanks for your advice!
---
Tara gang rise up
---
Lol nice!
---
Old rickochet is the best
---
Just keep playing and you‚Äôll get over the hump! Maybe watch a few YouTube videos if you really want to get better!
---
Only buy the 49 gem mega box deal if you want the best deal. Otherwise just the token doubler. But you are free to decide :)
---
Haha. I don't use auto aim.
---
interesting
---
I‚Äôm also playing on SE, actually 
---
Excuse me wtf?!
---
He's the Trolls Friend mate.
---
Wtf
---
Are you high?
---
wow
---
The translation is: "brawlers left"
---
So simple yet so good
---
I only like Piper in long ranged maps. Where brawlers come from one side. I think bounty mode is the best for Piper.
---
no
---
please complete it i want to see it man its aweasom
---
Why does he? Because you normies don't understand irony? /s ruins the whole joke. L
---
Neymar biffed
---
U can see in the vid who spins first tho (not me) :)
---
This is insaneüòçüòçüòç
---
One word: Bull
---
how do you do this?
---
Mate. If you aren't an idiot you fucking realize it's duo. OP made a joke and idiots don't understand it, that's what happened. 
---
I don't know why,but I don't get notifications from brawl
---
You can presume that my Shelly ruined my trophies. Maybe I should say with straight wordsüòâ
---
Holy shit
---
True 
---
Dynamike
---
I will not stop posting this "shit" if u dont like it go away,and look at that frank in the vid,look who spinned first,just so u can see that i am not taking advantage of someone that has lower power.
---
Play with team
---
50 coins are fine down there because trophies are so easy to get. My next reward is 300 coins - and I have 70k stockpiled. It‚Äôs going to take hours of grinding this whole season to get that lackluster reward. While low levels can just push another 50/100 cups in an hour or less, and get the next reward.
---
Uhhh...I think you posted in the wrong Subreddit
---
I got in  a chest Piper and Tara too and 2 days before Leon  a free chest
---
I suppose that‚Äôs constructive feedback so thanks
---
Gene also
---
I sense some salty new players who just got rekt by a mini, jküåö
---
But the feeling of opening mega box is very good, i think it is worth extra 10 gem :)
---
Doesn't matter tho, you're still spinning and temporarily teaming with them. That's why teaming can't be stopped even if people like you backstab. On average (at least for me) Out of 10 showdown matches, 9 times there are no betrayers and only 1 time there is one. I lose a few trophies but in gained much more from teaming. Benefit outweighs the risk
---
I thought I was cool with my 10 Brawl and 2 big boxes saved
---
Lol gg you literally killed your Luck with this Epic box
---
Finally a man of culture xdxdxd
---
Oof, F. Yeah, legendaries are extremely hard to get. That's why some people say you're better off just biting the bullet and paying the 25-35 for their offers when they pop up, because you'll have to go through an unholy amount of boxes to get one. 
---
Looks amazing !
---
I‚Äôll buy it 
---
Too much fortnite
---
I have 10 brawlers **** this game dude I cant play battleroyale mode  if I win I get 3 if I be second I get -7
---
I knew you wouldn't observe jack.

Lmao
---
If only you got star player
---
Sorry to listen that, at least the game crash you like in my IPhone?
---
Ur and idiot... cant you see this this dude is "following" this dude and spectating his games where he does this every game.... just look at the video dumbass
---
Bc they can't grind anymore with their main acc 
---
It is not really teaming temporarily if u think about it,teaming means teaming against someone,here the person spins then i spin and betray,here i just gained his trust nothing more,i didnt hit someone with another someone against someone,u get me?
---
Lol wrong stupid ass
---
Creative
---
Thx bro,much love !

iphone, i haven't been playing brawl stars for a while, in the past it didn't lagg while screen recording, i see now it does, rip. so ill use my 400+ brawlers to trollü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Nope she still sucks ass in showdown
---
Lmao your mom

no ur

This could also be teaming in showdown lol. Great job

ewwwwwwwwwwwwww
---
That was odd but probably, unless it can be deflected elsewhere 
---
Just like when my wife texts me 20 massages in 15 seconds while I'm playing bs. You can prevent apps from being able to create notifications on android
---
ha! you just activated my trap card! get thicco'd
---
Your chances of getting gene wont change. My point is that say u can get either gene or spike. If u were to get spike first, ur chance of getting gene would remain the same. However if u get gene first ur chance of getting spike would decrease heavily. So you clearly want to get spike before u get gene, right? And the one way to make sure you get spike before gene is to just open your boxes instead of saving up
---
Let's use sign languages instead to tell him- OH GOD HES NOT LOOKING AT US OH GOD OH FAC
---
You now what they say about big feetüòâ
---
i know, that all happened since it came out for android...  the only way to play without lagg is using a new phone with only brawl stars and world's best wifi router lol
---
Yeah right, those are so easy to combat, there practically useless, the real problem is The RG 
---
Yo Supercell can we get a report function?
---
Right wins because only melee or bad player would have enemy Shelly SUPER point blank. Brawlers like Piper can SUPER and not take damage btw.
---
I hope not
---
Ehehe thanks. Pues muchas gracias
---
Oh shit you're right, I feel so dumb
---
Very normal 
---
Nice brawlers, just one clarification, every brawler when levelling up gain 5% in hp and atk ( total of 40% from level 1 to 9) so you should see back their stats
---
Thanks for the great words
---
No bull super right to the safe
---
Supercell you should definitely add this. Soon every players will get to 10 000 trophies they just need time. And right now the high trophy players who already have all their brawlers 500 have no motivation to play and reach high trophies because they know that at the end of the season there gonna loose there trophies and they wont even get anything. Once every brawler is 500 there is no motivation to continue playing. The other players will just catch up with time and it s like nothing happened. We re ‚Äúmax‚Äù now so we should have an advantage.
---
If only his voice didnt sound like skeletor
---
I just asked Frank on twitter about it,he says that they are aware of the problem and working on it,shouldnt be too long and we will see a bug fixes update rolling out!

---
But see this shouldn‚Äôt be the case. It shouldn‚Äôt be that people don‚Äôt play a game mode to avoid teaming, that just shows there‚Äôs a problem 
---
#I WANT MY MOMMY
---
Looks amazing tho, have an updoot.
---
Yes...its basically that map but changed a little bit because that one had things that didnt add much to the gameplay and one path corridors that are annoying in game...its that map with a little twist...and that corridors on the side should have less grass also like i did on mine
---
Well I got 600 Crow, that‚Äôs my achievement. But still congrats 
---
God, at least be original
---
Bad map since you can‚Äôt get to the middle 
---
But they can hit people 
---
I‚Äôm at 2122 trophies and 19/22 brawlers. Still need Bo, Spike and Crow. Matchmaking has been ridiculous lately, most players I get matched with get suicidal if we close to winning. Anyone else having problems with matchmaking? 
---
Awful. You can't have 1 tile gaps

you're right it was 1.99

El Secundo ?
---
I certainly think so!
---
prob just needed some extra gems
---
1/6 chance but feels like 1/100
---
So pretty... Pretty epic!
---
Did you see the spawn locations of brawlers, they can‚Äôt unless they get into the middle
---
Ok.
---
I feel you bro, i feel you
---
I tried :))
---
Hahahaha.Jajajaja
---
It already exists it's called showdown
---
You can hit people
---
Brawlers are upgraded but only for star power.
---
Meaning, i u play alone in friendly game now after downloading the optional update, all brawlers will be having starpowers but will be on your current level.
---
Ouch‚Ä¶ There are many people complaining about MM¬†and displaying not so bad pairings, but your case seems reaaaaally bad :'(
---
why u not want me to join bro :(
---
Too obvious! Lolü§£ü§£

Thank you!
---
they don't dude .
---
They don't .
---
Too true
---
üòÇ I didn‚Äôt even notice
---
U have 286 trophies as ur team highest while opponent has 221 
---
Heres my Idea for a new bounty map, what do you guys think?
---
Yeah, seen another similar issue on twitter, of a ball bouncing off a wall that had just been destroyed. Hope that SC will fix this soon.
---
Nothing is stopping you from teaming if you are that adamant in playing Showdown at higher trophies. I read the Solo as in "One-man queue" so you can't premade into a Showdown unless you play Duo Showdown.
---
Why they allow teaming is probably only Supercell that knows. Theories are that they are small team so they won't have the resources to investigate if reporting would be available, as people would make false reports when they are upset that they lost (happens in every single Arena/Moba games). It would be technically hard to implement any function or feature to prevent teaming since there will always be workarounds for it.
---
üòÇ üòÇ üòÇ

What happens at the end?

4K upvotes. One post is probably gonna rack up more karma than I do sheesh

It feels like bullshit lol
---
I guess we will nees this when we will get more brawlers

Download the optional update, your brawlers will be on ur current level but with star power

So much better than the Rico Model.

Amazing, just add the spawns and make the middle more interesting and BOOM new awesome map that I think its best

He wants some sakura spike

No it Will be abused by mini accounts of pro playerw

Looks like Island Invasion.

Screw Clash Royale, least in brawl stars it isn't p2w like in clash royale. In clash Royale even if you're skilled you can't beat a max player. But in brawl stars, you can kill a level 10 easily with skill.

Go watch some youtube and learn how to play brawl ball. You can play him in solo showdown but you're competing for 2nd and 3rd place and your main strategy is bush waiting and killing low health people.
---

Actually nvm barley would be op in this
---
Is this what hell looks like?
---
Theres new version made by u/Sector03 btw 
---
Yes this should be a thing
---
?
---
that's why it should be unlocked at 5K trophy's, like i said in the post
---
Damn your so smart 
---
Mortis, like his title in game, is a mobile assassin. He works well with Crow as both can attack targets at the same time while being able to keep up with the others high speed. Don't dash into groups, hunt single targets. Rule of thumb, don't engage shotgunners unless you can guarantee a kill. Your main targets should be Piper, Penny, Barley, Mike, Bo, Brock, and Jessie. Other tankier squishies like Colt, Poco, and Shelly should be second priority. Also, don't engage tanks (Pam, Primo, Bull) unless you have great backup. 
---
You're right but SC should do something about this. Either remove solo showdown since they team up anyway or make something that would prevent teaming up. As for the restriction of controls, DotA 2 has turn rate and it is a moba game. 
---
looooll
---
Like it

Goddamnit

wow..

oh i didn't maybe it was my friend when i left my computer open.

No he can with a super

What if you just wanted to win

BUT THE GAME SAID NO
---
ever realised a team consists of 3 players?
---
What? Is this a joke? Ricochet was old rico
---
Don't woooosh me

This could be a great feature for the showdown map, maybe you could get hurt by it and get knocked (like bull's super)

if you look closely the bull kicks the ball before you grab him but good vid

July 2017, when the legendary that I earned is 10 elixir ;-;
---
Where is spike?
---
And I hope Life Leech is coming back. But that's a modifier. Question is how they could stop teaming in the regular Solo Showdown, and so far I've yet to see a viable solution being suggested.
---
Looks like Tara
---
It increased after every boxes you opened, just a little bit after some big numbers. It also drops every time you get any brawler.
---
So the possibility is you have your chances up a bit and the drops again after you got all those rare brawlers.
---
It drops every time you open a new brawler, also don‚Äôt be expecting another legendary for a long while
---
They won‚Äôt guy you‚Äôll now that gene is going to be released when te you tubers losers will get the ok from supercell to drop a sneak peak , when you ‚Äòlol see it on you tube then gene will be dropped some days later , it‚Äôs annoying because we already know everything thanks to the data mine so drop it already jeez

A friend of mine has leon but not el primo so...

I was trying to find the official info about this, and I was refering to an old video that discussed the luck factor maybe they changed it. I hope you are right though
---
Ever played clash royale? They give out free chests all the time but dare you to mention free emojis. 
---
The buff she didn‚Äôt need
---
actually that's pretty cool though 
---
People will just wait at spawn until people die and then go to the middle 
---
Thank u
---
Im not saying El Primo cant win showdown you just have to use him right. But stfu you camping noob. Im glad you lost. You are cancerous like a camping bull. (I also know you have to get your super to have a decent chance of winning but still :/)
---
Lol its not that he is stupid, this guy is simply too smart
---
With those odds, the chance that you get it in the next 500 boxes (assuming 2 pulls per box) is over 90%!
---
Welcome m8 (wear the hat if ur a true Mortis)
---
That‚Äôs pretty cute :3
---
Ok that makes sense, but I‚Äôll check my chances after every brawl box I open and it still doesn‚Äôt change.
---
Never would have noticed it
---
i didn't say that i believe it or something, the laggs ruin the day since day 1
---
Every time I open a box, it increases by 0.0014%
---
Jessie kills as big brawler. free boxes for days
---
Playing above 500 trophies so randoms OP
---
We need a tara version of this
---
Top 10 Anime Plot Twist
---
Everytime I open a box, it increases by 0.0000% :(

I thought they fixed it...
---
But the buff she deserved.
---
12k is good
---
I never said Supercell doesn't make skins for very rare brawler, I said they clearly prioritize common brawlers and that's a logical way of working. Very rare brawlers have, at most, 1 skins, meanwhile Brock has 4!
---
It's not increasing after every box, it's more like after 10-30 boxes, I forgot the quantities
---
I really like this
---
*would this be lrgsl or illegal*
---
Too much overleveling and slow ass progress just made it boring. Is it just me or is progress pretty slow for brawl too?
---
Literally me
---
Oh, okay. Thanks. How much does it increase by?
---
Lol now im *dapper*
---
The same happens to me
---
I started with the global launch. Ive opened every box I could afford as soon as possible. Ive bought most of the specials offered. 22/22 brawlers.
---
That has to be me
---
*when you team in duo showdown*
---
curiously I got the same Brawler, in the same box

I would buy them if they are available to buy size 44 eu

While frank is a tank, he‚Äôs not dangerous like the other ones. Frank‚Äôs best bet is to protect his high dps squishy teammates while they stay back and clear the map. He‚Äôs usually the big bodyguard. However he is still a tank and when only the team remains, 90% of the time everyone turns on frank, so he has to be quick with his super because he‚Äôs not getting 2 shots at it

Yes, I know, I just lost the old picture of the fan map in the gallery, so I decided to post. And the app for creating maps is not updated, so I would remake this map for a new style. Sorry.

My record is 18 seconds
---
I love it Leon needs a huge nerf

it‚Äôs based in brawler trophies not overall. so any brawler over 500 will reset halfway.

wait this illegal

Neither Nita is original..

Annie from League of Legends is older

Your correct but let‚Äôs agree that this is his friend because of all the other points. Tbh, the supercell point and spectate point is all I wanted to make but it seemed interesting.

probably due to the graphics quality being pretty good

Flipped my computer upside down. Worth it

I am FTP and most of my brawlers are lvls 6,7,8 and I have one on lvl 10, so what do you mean it's not enough? Just like your money irl, manage your gold properly and you will see progress.

This is fcking legit.

heh, you think that‚Äôs hate, the only brawler i got from the box is *piper*......... yeah
---
Similar situation as you, man. If I don't pull a new brawler soon I may just quit the game. It's getting ridiculously boring playing on the same modes using the same brawlers... And supercell also ruined my fav game mode brawl ball

13 is not much

&gt;I‚Äôm not saying El Primo can‚Äôt win showdown you just have to use him right.

#***SWIMMING WITH THE FISHES***

It‚Äôs like talking to a wall

Brawl ball isn‚Äôt about the person who scored it, people have to work together, especially after the update
---
Personally, I like it.
---
Yes the other people knew from the start that someone was playing primo in their showdown match so they decided to team up and 3v1 him.
---
I‚Äôm very new to the game and trying to understand how the odds work. I have unlocked all Rare and Super Rare brawlers, but when I open chests it still gives me the percent chance of opening one of them. I obviously can‚Äôt open any more of them - where does that chance go? I assume it‚Äôs just for power points/coins? Also, I don‚Äôt have any star powers that I can unlock yet - where does that chance go? 
---
X to Doubt
---
Just keep scolling if you don't like it
---
Jeez no need to yell
---
Never bought a skin but i would for this one damn,i love it
---
I think this is a good idea, but, I think it should be so for the first 1.5 sec or only a portion of the invincible  time should be used for this. Otherwise I think it would be a little too easy to score. Good idea though!
---
This is a widely known issue
---
The only thing that bugs me is thst there ia written the gamage per each bullet/pumch/hit/whatever but the is written only under a few character how many billets they have per each attack

No. Please tell me this is photoshopped I‚Äôm crying and shaking

Like 500 on a brawler. Or like 1000 trophies on the trophy road
---
I used to hate backstabbing. I was a teamer before #StoptheSpin came and was loyal and didn‚Äôt kill someone who had low health. I remember the days when you couldn‚Äôt even team in showdown even when you wanted to as there were organized teams using voice chat. However ever since #StoptheSpin I‚Äôve never teamed once except to backstab. Now I don‚Äôt team at all instead of backstabbing cause I think of backstabbing as a mean thing but that‚Äôs just my opinion. Nice work man :)
---
That‚Äôs how mafia works
---
Can I explain to you how roles work? If I‚Äôm the front line. And I‚Äôm level 4. To the enemy front lines level 7. There is no scenario, where I go head to head with the same champion that I‚Äôm using, and win. None. Zero. He kills me in 3 autos. I kill him in 5. That‚Äôs not balanced. 
---
Its funny that i got it from a free box
---
Very true. I was thinking with brawl stars how positioning and things like on a more 3D level would make it more skillful. But Royale does take a lot into it to become good.  
---
LOL LOSER 
---
Wow! What's your legendary droprate at? I'm corious
---
Lmao it said intense so i thought it suited it correctly
---
this is weird, exact same thing happened to me, am also Alex
---
Thank u and i was like u actually,but when i was a loyal teamer i was getting betrayed üòÇüòÇ
---
Stole my idea
---
When did he max out his account? If you maxed out during the start of beta it only cost you like 400-500 lol
---
Mine is 0.0197 lol
---
She looks older than she actually is.
---
Did you do this today
---
No, I have a 10-inch tablet and it has happened to me many times, there must be a way to separate the controls for those who are "clumsy".
---
Then play a different game. But the reality is, I can kill 3 people come in 7th place and still lose trophies while some bush camping Bull does nothing and gets second place. The game mode is survival. It's not about kills or playing honorably, it's about making it to the end by any means necessary. The "solo" part simply means you showed up as a solo player not that you can't use some strategy to out last your opponent. 
---
Look, I'm not the one you need to be mad at. I didn't create the game mode or decide how many trophies you lose. I'm just a player trying to play. Direct your frustrations into something positive, like suggesting better game modes for solo players rather than posting negativity because one aspect of a fairly broad game is stressing you out. 
---
thats how mafia works 
---
It‚Äôs just a piece of paper
---
Gg #pocoplaydespacito
---
He's appeared twice since I started play like a couple months ago I'm sure he'll be back
---
Wow Rest In Peace! Such unluck üòíüòíüòí
---
Under-rated comment ^
---
I can‚Äôt believe these comments... You can play whatever brawler you want on whatever map you want. It‚Äôs not like you‚Äôre playing 3v3 and picking a bad brawler and putting other people at a disadvantage. You‚Äôre by yourself, why would it matter who you play. 
---
Camping is a strategy, not ‚ÄúcAnCEr‚Äù. If people don‚Äôt learn to shoot a bush where someone may be sitting then that‚Äôs their problem and you have all the rights to take advantage of it.
---
Teaming has been a problem for over a year now and the devs just don‚Äôt care enough to stop it. Used to be my favourite mode when the game launched but I rarely play it anymore cause it‚Äôs practically a death sentence.
---
Can you do some tips about showdown?
---
Wow lol
---
you could add a REPORT button to players who do double in showdown and IMPROVE THE CROW
---
Mate if you watch YouTube then go browse brawl stars you'll find it. It was only Released in one country first (canada) and then several countries (soft launch) then global.
---
Each brawler had a description before global, bull is nearsighted, spike is the last of his kind and so on 
---
Yeah thats annoying too.
---
Man but hope so that doesn't happen often, cheers! 
---
i downvoted
---
Legends are overrated and will get boring very quickly if you overuse them upon receiving them. Trust me when I say you will be disappointed after a week of getting one or even two. Also if you really just want to use them and don‚Äôt want them for trophy pushing, then make an alt or two and just get the daily 2-3 boxes and you will more than double your chances of getting a legendary (even if it‚Äôs not on your main). Everything I said is based off my experience, and it could relate you as I got my legendary chance to be higher than my mythical and was playing since beta/July 2017.
---
I know how u feel about teaming and all that stuff and i feel the same. But what i meant is that teaming in 3v3 game modes is WORSE than teaming in Showdown 
---
that a dad way to say fortnite
---
Alright thank you so much!
---
I already did some changes, I want to put later.
---
Thank you üòÄ
---
Wym exploit?
---
Huh
---
THANK YOU üòá
---
Around 1500$ to max an account atm
---
Francyy
---
I want Mortis so bad
---
Thats very very good holy
---
skins are purely cosmetic it doesnt give any advantage, you already get gems in boxes. they need to make money if you want new updates and shit. i f you want the skins so bad pay or wait to have the gems for it.
---
Just to ask, do you really have Leon?
---
Don‚Äôt get it
---
My chances for a Mythical is 0.2496% is that a long wait? From big box
---
Yeah got him at 700 from a regular brawl box (i was more shocked than happy at the time cause i felt like i didn't deserve it)
---
I know that feel bro :c
---
Upside down 
---
And for a legendary 0.1248%
---
People who Question players for taking tanks are those that team. They hope that they'll get bigger teams in showdowns and have fun bullying Tanks.
---
Is everything alright?
---
Look how they've massacred my account!!!!! 
---
That is a bug abuser
---
didn't even think of that, thanks for the feedback!
---
it won't happen :) uninstall the game
---
Downvote.
---
I guess you could say Leon looks Shelly
---
Jajajajaj, yeah, I love you, thank you for translated it
---
Yes!
---
Lol I just noticed I have a typo there üòÇüòÖ
---
Nice info but what's the link with my request?
---
This is what I'm talking about
---
it‚Äôs very very sad.  he‚Äôs playing against bots. lol. no skilled required what so ever. 
---
thanks for the tip
---
For months I kept thinking if the game could be killed because solo showdown was a fail at higher levels
---
They 're XtreMe together
---
Leon nerfs didn't actually work
---
*Attracts bull*
---
I play a bit of guitar myself so I fully support this idea, but I think Supercell has bigger fish to fry at the moment.
---
Not all heroes wear capes
---
It's called upvote
---
Yep just me then.
---
Read the main guys name I‚Äôm sure you can figure it out bud
---
Link for anyone wondering: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T0n-Z4UbrI 
---
Sameeeeeeeee
---
This is amazing wow 
---
Go onto your phone‚Äôs settings app and disable them from there.
---
If you told me exactly what the racial slur was it‚Äôd probably help me find it
---
His name is Nucking Figgers, I don‚Äôt see any slur there???
---
Well I guess it‚Äôs incredibly frustrating then. There are certain days, with my current champion pool, where it just feels like there is nothing I can do beside bush camp with Bull. And that genuinely feels horrible to do. 
---
Problem isn‚Äôt primo, it‚Äôs the 6 power things he had. They knew they had no chance in a fair fight so they teamed him. It‚Äôs not fair but that‚Äôs the mentality 
---
He should have the X in his eye like his old skin
---
Pretty sure it‚Äôs one draw at tat chance 
---
This was last month...
---
snipers can take the darryl out before he charge his super
---
I like your points. 
---
Read the description right above the percentages üòÑ
---
I have the exact same problem. Been playing 12 hours since the game came out
---
I can't look at a box ready to open and just leave it 
---
10 of 10 what is everyone else doing this is da bomb best
---
Uh im so new to reddit i still havent worked out how to post to a specific thread or subreddit. XD
---
I‚Äôm either getting whooshed or you‚Äôre impressively stupid
---
Hope it appears soon for you mate, I haven‚Äôt seen spike in shop in a while so it will soon. I think.
---
O didn‚Äôt see that my bad
---
Season reset resets brawler trophies above 500
---
This needs to be a map!
---
Of course it isn‚Äôt good but sometime people underestimate my super and then die when I play barley 
---
Oh, that makes sense. I feel stupid now.
---
i have this mod as well, and everyone already seen gameplay of him
---
His name is fucking n word with the f and n swapped 
---
This post was made by Darryl gang lol
---
~~I recognize this persons name somewhere~~
---
Lol Morris before buff
---
whys this getting downvoted its literally the truth
---
Where is it?
---
The ones you mention utilize generic costume schemes that aren't direct copyright.  Ninja Turtles would be a tough one.  I had a thread with some of my best skin ideas not long ago and specifically left out a few like this for same reasons.  FAT PRINCESS PAM?  Yea I don't think Sony would allow it, lol.
---
he pulls enemys only to himself btw I have Gene so I can test your myths but I i don't understand how he could pull someone to the water
---
Big box, I don't think you can pull 2 brawlers from 1 normal box
---
Looks like "one piece" character
---
Totally agree...i would love to try my maps and some others ive seen here
---
Removed.
---
Rule 6. Keep self-promotion limited, tasteful and well received by the community.
---
One thing is that by the time his super passively charges on his little island, the boxes on the very edge would probably be already engulfed in the poison cloud. Maybe move them in farther. Pointless observation.
---
it‚Äôs a Darryl only map, hence called ‚ÄúDarryl games‚Äù
---
You got all three! You just can't see Leon.
---
That would make Bush Campers even worse!
---
no, you won't. Iknow because i have that modified version with gene
---
My level 9 Darryl cries in the hopes of finding his star power in a box. 
---
Rule 6. Keep self-promotion limited, tasteful and well received by the community. We also expect you to be an active member of this community.  
---
Grrr!
---
I would rate Darryl's star power in the top 10.
---
This is how they get copyright sued
---
IKR. If the mode have some legitmate issue, they should at least let us know why they are removing them
---
Hey buddy there‚Äôs a thing in the game that directly counters campers, it‚Äôs called checking bushes.
---
No personal attacks.
---
wait... how?
---
It would be cool if they could begin with star power
---
Teaming in any game infuriates me 
---
This is a zoinks for me scoobs...
---
r/whoosh
---
Inagine getting stuck on one of the islands
---
Mortis Gang strikes again!
---
This has been posted like a million times already
---
crow is good
---
The whole crowd is just made up of Bull and Shelley
---
the game‚Äôs definition, it says ‚Äúsolo‚Äù. 
---
3500 trophies- 50 coins???? &amp;&amp; it continues to get worst as you level up...MUCH worst....
---
It's your fault for bush camping on thousand lakes with Primo.  
---
bos star power is complete trash lol
---
Tu veux dire qu‚Äôon a pas tous les m√™mes chances d‚Äôavoir tel ou tel truc?
---
Thats really high
---
this person keeps drawing good stuff
---
I legit tried all my 14 brawlers and they r still like let‚Äôs team up on him bc he has no good name I guess
---
Wreck-It Frank!
---
_NIGHT MODE_
---
Don't forget about that one mortis that will steal your energy drink and win with no power cubes
---
those look like bots
---
I understand how the Star Power system works and that I‚Äôm unable to open them now, but I‚Äôm curious how that 1% chance is distributed among the other options. Does this just mean that I‚Äôm 1% more likely to receive power ups/coins? I assume so, but it‚Äôs unclear. 
---
It didn't use to be, and on a grassy map it can stop a bull from getting you.
---
I suppose boxes could be added to the outside of each unit, thank you for the criticism, the middle portion was the most difficult to work out.
---
Best map so why not have it up more?
---
Unfair and one tile gaps reedee
---
My buddy said I would really like siege but I just never bought it *shrug
---
At this point, just waiting for TD2 and only back to TD for that reason.
---
He‚Äôs saying that he is the same Rico as before, so you shouldn‚Äôt use him because he is thicc. He said that if you don‚Äôt hit shots off of walls, you are as useless as before the update.
---
Every Brawler would win. Duh. Jokes aside, Shelly's super is trash.
---
so its point capture
---
like in fps games
---
Weird. They just made a plushie of her, so you‚Äôd think it would be a minor change to not make the plushies look outdated.
---
yea, it used 2 be super overpowered but its not anymore.. its not even great on cavern churn anymore because of all the dynamikes 
---
Then quit the game lol
---
This needs more upvotes :(
---
Not good for kids
---
People are dumb on this game. Chase me all the way around the map in a circle and then get killed themselves because they were so stupid.
---
Shaggy can win
---
Haha, Mike and barley would be annoying 
---
Um, no.
---
he gon' find another girl
---
They aren't
---
I have an android
---
I'm screaming rn #6
---
The good half of the subreddit salutes u 
---
No, that is clearly mentioning that you will enter this game alone, with no party. Whether or not teaming is cheating is obviously subjective, but by no definition is it a fact
---
It is a subjective opinion, all maps should have the same chances, because not everyone wants to play on the same map that often
---
These posts deserve upvotes, please supercell. Make showdown great again.
---
Luck,man. Luck.
---
We need that story line
---
The bane of my existence! Thanks for the heads up.
---
Noice
---
There‚Äôs not much you can do to fix it Op. even with my Iphone 8+ and good internet I lag all the time.
---
lol whatever you say teamer. 
---
Non, les chances augmentent au fur et a mesure qu'on ouvre des box
---
Not even close
---
How do you check your own luck? 
---
It is x)
---
I‚Äôm screaming rn #7
---
Yeah, you‚Äôre just getting unlucky on the power points. You should still be thankful for him though, took me a year and a half to get my first legendary
---
I thought the same thing as you when I got Tara and Mortis. For a while I got almost nothing for them, but after a little while the points started coming. So, don't worry, they will come!
---
Tar-uh is how I say it.
---
Sometimes i think that people didn't realize that they can buy really good games instead of spending money in just one game
---
Do people really think this? My easiest solo wins have actually come as Mortis, which surprised the hell out of me
---
Yah, same, he is still op though.
---
Patience
---
I would say top 3.
---
And, I‚Äôm not saying spike is bad... I even said he‚Äôs really powerful. I just feel like the old spike was a lot more fun to play.
---
I‚Äôm also excited for the buff he won‚Äôt get until it‚Äôs October 
---
No it's fine as is now, the walls on the corner of the goals can be easily broken and if enemy team does get a team wipe it makes it easier for them to score while simultaneously giving the other some chance to come back. This way, it's not one mistake equalling to a definite loss. 
---
In gem grab for example, gem carries can make a mistake and lose 10 gems but the team can still come back from it, what ur suggesting is equivalent to making a barrier for the team making them not being able to come back.
---
Trophies are supposed to represent skill... Unfortunately, because of the current exploit and Showdown, trophies don‚Äôt carry too much of a skill value.
---
As for the power levels... It is definitely possible to beat lvl 10 brawlers with lvl 1s... power lvl doesn‚Äôt predetermine the outcome of a game. Half the time, when I verse players that have star powers ob my second account, they are freaking hopeless.
---
Mm will never be based off of powerlevels... Otherwise what would the point of them be? Just hope that Supercell will fix the value of trophies.
---
Oh noes
---
Luckily I didn‚Äôt roll into a bull or Shelly wif super lol 
---
You know that he is spectating and you can only spectate YOUR FRIEND. So this is his friend lol.
---
Who will ban? Who will look through the reports? Where are those resources going to come from? Administrating a Report-function requires manpower and resources, both which costs money. I doubt it will be something that will be prioritised anytime soon, as there are more people actually teaming than there are people complaining about it.
---
If SC has said that it's OK to team with others, then I don't see them having any plans to do anything about it. It might come in the future, once the game gets more popular, more players and the Brawl Stars team can grow bigger. But for now, if SC has said that it's OK then most likely it will stay that way.
---
:O
---
Smh... 
---
Club members***

What the hell is happening

I hate you

Brock ‚ù§Ô∏è win
---
Thank you :3
---
Isn‚Äôt gene legendary
---
Piper was confirmed to be getting a remodel sooner 
---
Was pretty clean... But kinda boring xD
---
I still miss the second portrait ui with pins... That was sexy af
---
i guess you can say you saw it for a SPLIT SECOND
---
Nah frank said they‚Äôre getting a remodel
---
We need to stop the mortcism!!!!!
---
This might seem like pouring salt on the wound, but earlier today i got spike out of regular brawl box and a few weeks ago my friend got leon from a regular brawl box
---
someone explain to me wtf that crow was thinking lmfao
---
5th, we're proud of u bro
---
Yeah ik what you are saying... But nobody likes losing. 
---
Having the current system in place is actually not a bad idea, it just needs some tweaking. I.e. only 1 game with bots after 3 losses allowed only
---
I guess he didn‚Äôt see the spike coming? 
---
Always assume the shelly has her super ready. You won't believe how many times I lost because I try to go after a shelly when she's low on health.
---
But it might be a win for him if he didn‚Äôt get into the grass for tht power cube , he jz need to keep a distance he has energy drink 
---
Darrel‚Äôs name is Sanz....BRUHHH
---
By backstabbing, I mean never having the intention to team and killing the second you spin. That will teach them not to trust random people.
---
Los primos* 
---
Bull can do that with his regular shot, I wonder why he isn't op.
---
BRAZZERS
---
&gt;Spike's stats are fine as they are, im just afraid that in the future, he'll be pushed away from the meta due to other brawlers reciving buffs or just Gene (the new brawler) being OP.
---
Then I probably misunderstood you, as you stated:  
---
" Spike's stats are fine as they are, im just afraid that in the future, he'll be pushed away from the meta due to other brawlers reciving buffs or just Gene (the new brawler) being OP. "  
---
I interpreted that Spike will be weaker in the future when the meta shifts and if other Brawlers gets buffed.  
---
I think Spike is fine where he is now though. We all like different I guess :) Personally I'm waiting for Bo to get buffed/more relevant, and Mortis as well.
---
Pam is very good in general grab, put her turret behind walls, but still in a position where it will heal teammates, don‚Äôt have Mortis so I can‚Äôt give any tips for him
---
Key words, CLOSE RANGE. Primo isn't good in the game right now, wonder why, far ranged brawlers.
---
Sharpshooters or nothing 
---
Yup. Seems like Supercell don‚Äôt want me to enjoy legendary gameplay 
---
Have you ever played showdown past 500, she is the worst brawler at that, even in grassy maps.
---
What if they have something comes up you can‚Äôt punish people for having a life
---
I think SANS would win
---
