I noticed I had ignored a few replies from people so I thought I'd finally answer. Is that such a bad thing?

---
Ummm wrong number bro
---
But I got 30 in a real match, not a friendly match
---
u/GEDI-KOR ain‚Äôt got shit when compared to this
---
Shelly + Spike =
---
That reminds me of [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/bcq7v0/new_skin_idea_jungle_shelly/eksqxzm/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app)
---
&gt; Or maybe the animation for his Super would still be visible when he uses it inside a bush.
---

---
That is a fantastic solution that would make him more fair without overly nerfing him. The animation should be pretty pronounced and stay just long enough to make sure people can see he cloaked.
---
Yes, I agree.
---
Next to the plant
---
Ok lmao
---
F to pay respects
---
She was playing minecraft
---
Can people see this?
---
2 tiles*
---
1 tile gaps created by supers don't exist anymore.
---
If its a new rare then everyone is going to just buy it from the shop
---
I know
---
Do you know if the Christmas stuff is coming back next year
---
Frankly, I didn‚Äôt even want a Bo remodel. I wish none of the brawlers were remodeled #keepthenostalgia
---
i had about the same amount of brawlers when i was at that trophy range buddy
---
Credit to u/HereBeJimbo for the meme template!
---
No
---
Dynamike would still be OP, same with Darryl, this map isn‚Äôt versatile in any way, everyone will play shotgunners or Dynamike and there are one-tile gaps. Cool Idea but it does not work in reality.
---
Pam skin should be the number one priority
---
:(
---
Nita learns English
---
Mega knight from clash royale
---
Sorry I just hate siege you should try untilting in showdown
---
Ummm... what?
---
[removed]
---
I'm don't know but I hope so. It would be pretty awful to make limited time skins and only have them available only that one moment do they should come back annually.
---
This would ender his super useless, both or your "ideas".
---
People have trouble dealing with Leon because of the lack of map awareness. People in higher trophy range have less problem dealing with Leon.
---
Not to say that Leon is not strong, he is. But this is not the way to balance him.
---
If its up to me, I would try to further shorten his super duration or maybe increase shots needed to charge super.
---
I really like the crow one
---
Wait now you can see the pic
---
Then remodel the hell outa tara, that crap is lit.
---
Just add Some arrows in there.
---
Yeah
---
If this is an additional Bo skin then it's okay.  If they are replacing the original with this one it's a serious downgrade.
---
As a nita main, I'm prepared
---
Turret drags people to it. Can't drag people under certain range.
---
Imaginable
---
It‚Äôs all fun and games until she punches those cacti in your nuts
---
My mom still tells me that lol
---
Pam is Jessie‚Äôs mom too, just a reminder
---
This is an awesome idea; adds some more color to the main menu.
---
.... I don't care
---
Nice loading screen concept, but maybe not the best box concept
---
Bounty

Onwards, my friends!
---
Hey, you broke my guitar.
---
**Bulls want to know your location**
---
Sounds like you are the bad one
---
Ooo
---
i too poor to afford skins will likely be a Legendary or Epic (which means i wont get her for a while and Bo remodel is bland so yay
---
I admit I‚Äôm not the best out there, but I sure as hell ain‚Äôt the worst. I‚Äôve literally watched my teammates let someone get away with less than 100hp. And yes I say watch because that person happened to be out of my range
---
I love how you turned around the brawlers to make the screenshots
---
Now i don't know if the remodel will be something like this.I wish that remodel too.
---
Lmao. I used Ibis Paint X.
---
One-tile gaps, and don‚Äôt add TNT, it isn‚Äôt in the game and they will not add it soon.
---
r/ColtGang
---
to be fair saying ‚Äòkid‚Äô is annoying and doesn‚Äôt give you the moral high ground
---
Bro, Gedi kor literally made what people on bs hate the most.... TOOK Bo's hat OFF and everyone applauded üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
So true. But only if they have her star power...
---
Either way, I don't think she can beat Bull in a  1v1.
---
Spike first, I want him to have a cute childish voice, hello again!
---
What happened to nita's semi dark skin? (Love the drawing
---
take all my properties and myself included
---
They give the spike plushie a remodel?
---
No I think this was the prototype plushie

*What the fuck have you brought upon this cursed land*
---
 Looks awesome, but remove the one hole gaps.
---
The worst, hide and seek with useless jump pannels and one tile gaps.
---
How would that work, my eyes are 3 colors and sometimes a 4th.
---
My grandma.
---
I've heard that brawlers can fit through one block gaps
---
Did you win?
---
I‚Äôm not gonna say it

---
love it ... it reminds me of high noon lobby !! anyone remembers that game ??? watch it on youtube and the theme song is legendary
---
Ive been playing since january 3rd and have every brawler ecxept spike but im also level 96
---
Wow have everyone except Leon Spike Mortis
---
No everyone is asking for a remodel like everyone was asking for one for bo
---
All the credits to my friend Gabriel Oliveira, who drew this amazing piece of art! üòç
---
There is no common, at least not anymore.
---
Rare
---
If he means by oldest models, that's a lie. The oldest model is actually Primo (once the update drops).
---
Cool XD
---
where is shelly?
---
It‚Äôs a pretty nice remodel+ supercell actually listened to us and put there own time into it
---
New bo sucks
---
Who are u saving up for?
---
Am I the only one who has America vibes?
---
She barely does dmg though and unless you‚Äôre retarded you‚Äôre not gonna sit there and box against her. Also, it depends how fast she charges her super, which given how high the dmg reduction is it‚Äôs probably gonna be slow charging. 
---
She‚Äôs just going to be an actual tank.
---
I did and the recommendation on that page is to try in app. I similarly emailed customer support and have yet to hear back from them.
---
She actually shares a greater resemblance to tara.
---
Tara has purple hair like shelly, but it is a bit darker like Rosa‚Äôs
---
And her skin is also darker, closer to Rosa than shelly is.
---
I won my first solo squads like this!!!
---
It‚Äôs ya boy Rohan Kishibe
---
at least spell hentai right smh
---
Huh. That seems pretty op. Do you know how quickly it charges? Because if this charges even remotely fast, then she will be unstoppable with her star power. You‚Äôll be healing more health while in bushes than the damage you‚Äôre taking.
---
Spike &lt;3 Shelly
---
Oh god, pam has three infinity stones
---
FBI OPEN UP
---
Huh, I hadn‚Äôt seen those yet
---
Wrong sub
---
Shelly got on bath salts, stole Primo‚Äôs clothes, killed Spike and wore his/her skin.
---
Anyone seen the new frozen movie?
---
twinsees
---
Yeah and it's not the same.
---
Me: *reads the complaint part*
---
Also Me: PENNY'S TURRET RANGE
---
Abuabuabuabua! *gives lamp*
---
I don‚Äôt understand how there‚Äôs people that still CANT see the resemblance. They‚Äôre literally identical.
---
u/rtil
---
Leon
---
Fuck forgot the flaif
---
They said somethung about a "training cave"
---
So that makes me think that we can try out any skin in a kind of sandbox place where there are targets to shoot
---
Brawlers only appear in friendly games if you have them
---
Yeah the person who made ducking thick Nita
---
No kne would understand unless he is an intellectual like me
---
Brawl stars sub
---
Brawl Well Puppers
---
if you play too much you'll burn yourself out but if i have all the brawlers trophies will become irrelevant bc i have all the progress i would need at that point it would just be for fun but in a game like this the content has to be over saturating or the game will die out example: COC/CR
---
I do have carl In my main account This is my third account
---
Wait till you‚Äôre Nita and the 8+ come after you in a hunting party

hahaha~~what a Plants girl!

congrats!

i think it means that by having 1 time only skins they will just have the file there, wasting space, because its now a useless file

Wow I wish I could do that teach me plzz
---
Let's talk! You think  shelly Will get a buff?
---
oh yes! a crossover between Touhou and Brawl stars is amazing!
---
Event skins are permanently yours once you buy them, so SC can't remove those skins to add others, nor just add more event skins for the same event.
---
Bo now looks like a father like Tribe leader, that just reinforces my theory that Bo is Nita's father.

Night witch mortis wasn't controversial

It was awful

But thicco made good

Wait.

Doesn't it mean I watched incest art on rule 34?

Hey, nope :D it's just that I need like 30 clips for every video and since my right hand is kinda messed up and gets tired very fast while writing, I just made a copy-paste text which I'm sending out everytime I find a good play :)

Brawl Ball Primo is insane with a good comp at 500+. If anything it requires more thought and coordination than the control comps you see at that rank (Nita/Tara/Spike/Jessie/Rico)
---
Ya the remodel looks ass I like BO how he is

Sorry I‚Äôm abit new to this game. Only started play since global

It's gonna be a rare brawler..Will cost around 19 gems.

I like our Nita :)

Yes I saw this cool post with all the stats but they wasn't confirmed it (not the user release). Now they did :)

I didn't know i see so much people hating it because it's not model from GEDI-KOR

That explains a lot! Much better than the "Netflix and Chill" part with Shelly and Spike.

Ÿ†if it was like clash royale it is gonna be so much better    that you can see the comp for every team and the brawlers trophys then you can see a replay
---
That would be awesome if that was the legit backstory
---
According  to a reddit  post she will be rare!
---
Why?
---
Really like this idea its kinda freshen this up
---
I agree with this. I had taken a break because my best characters (Shelly, Colt and Jessie) Got too high in rank too fast. when I came back I felt like I couldn't win a single match which frustrated me so much; frustration which caused me to lose focus and am literally unable to play because I get angry + frustrated when I see my rando team mates being too weak to do anything.
---
335 Average Trophies vs. 378 Average Trophies. Looks pretty solid
---
What..?
---
But It's my Idea and I don't know your map...
---
agreed
---
That was the fucking idea, genius!

Guys, I got the uno player!

https://youtu.be/dSKdjm2K_bg Watch this video ..It will clarify your doubts. And put '1' ,not #1. And it works for character upto 7 , not more than that.

This actually looks sick! Good job!

Nice

Matchmaking is based on average Trophies not individual Trophies
---
I did not sow that sry all.

I'm sorry but your evil plan didn't succeed

I know, they said that. So why am i finding 1k total trophies in my team when i got 7k? Mmh

or auto aim

And Rosa.

That's great. But I still think that Rosa will completly kill the Tankers and Shellies. RIP my waifu

Ya sure!
---
Take you on average 4 months and 10 days to get 140 gems unfortunately
---
Same, I feel like the original is better but everyone like sakura because of the videos and in-game textures
---
U lucky boi
---
Thats hot
---
Because matchmaking is in the end based on the brawlers individual trophies, not the overall trophies. The brawlers individual Trophies influence your teams average trophies.

This looks like a nice update. Finally a bo remodel

A reason why she needs a remodel

probably a thanks vid for 1M subs

Wait...is that meet from my club!??!?!?!?

Actually it should be added!Nice job!

Yeah i know

Poco would be better

Your been playing since the start of global with $200 spent and have only just got your first legendary?! Wow that‚Äôs insanely unlucky

Remove the "in" then this post is perfect.

I used to think Crow could have an optional buff, because as some people mentioned, he is weak because of wHaM bAM hERe cOmEs pAm in like, literally every game mode, so I would have believed a Pam nerf such that she is less frequently used, should already be enough of an indirect buff to Crow.
---
Hope this buff ain't too big, otherwise he would just be the next Pam.
---
This should be added in game!

Its a PC MMORPG game,its a good game,little bit hard to adapt.

There are some servers per country

But i do not recommend to play.

Since the game was purchased by other company,the game was dying.

Its a very good game,there are people playing but i do not recommend to play until it improves.

You can see videos in YouTube if u want more info.

me when i see siege is available

It‚Äôs the text that they use, it is one word but to make it look better that‚Äôs how the font looks

WoahWoahWoahWoahWoahWoahWoahWoahWoahWoahWoahWoahWoahWoahWoahWoahWoahWoahWoahWoahWoahWoahWoahWoahWoahWoahWoahWoahWoahWoah how did you find out

I have this odd theory:

New Brock is Old Brock's son
---
New Mortis is the reincarnation of Old Mortis
---
New Dynamike is Old Dynamike's younger brother
---
New Bo seems like Old Bo's twin brother
---
Rico is Ricochet's BIG Brother
---
Old Bull is just regular Bull having a flu
---
And the "New" brawlers teamed up and killed all the "Old" ones and that's why they all are in heaven
---
I thought that to

Why were so many ppl filming?

Soglad its a green cucumber and not a red or blue one

Background sure. Replace logo, no. They use that in many other places other than matchmaking.

It's not a cat it's Shiba Nita =))

QUICKFIRE works well on enemies close to you.

I don't know if this belongs to r/Brawlstars or to r/aww

Oh.

IITTSSSS PIKACCCHHUUUUU!!!!!!

Is this an out of season April fool's joke?

So changing the map to be showdown sized made it unfun?

What my favourite brawler is piper or brock

Potato mafia

New story arc! Shelly and Spike are Rosa‚Äôs kids with another unknown brawler, who will be revealed as the next brawler to enter the game
---
Darryl: am i a fking joke for u?
---
OMG it's EL PENISüò®
---
Ahhhh i know, i was really tired and didnt want to drop trophies looking for teamers in sd, so i just used something off of google images/a video instead
---
Not the combination but ok
---
What‚Äôs your clubs ‚ô£ name?
---
Lol made this a real meme
---
Crow Buff = Buffed Crow = Crow Remodel
---
Take my pet cactus. When it dies it turns into fireworks! I call it a needle grenade. Fun to use!
---
Which demon
---
There would be way too many reports to go through them all and this would be highly inaccurate as two people could gang up on a weaker enemy to take them out and get reported for teaming even though that‚Äôs just strategy. Teaming is a very difficult problem to deal with reasonably.
---
Then I definitely need this.
---
The real Bull.
---
Ha ha ha
---
Showdown be like
---
and then that dude downvotes you, smh
---
Event loading screen would probably look really cool.

Rare brawler or rare in general like mythic or legendary

They wanted to remove the western feeling, right? Well this background could mean many things apart western style.

1150 at lvl though.

I'm an android made bt cyberlife

---
I think what happend is that the Shelly and Carl were in a lobby together so when they go into a game it tries to even out the trophies levels by making everyone in-between there trophy's
---
I'm surprised that she's not Epic at the very least and the update only comes with two new skins. How will they make money off this update?
---
Wait, that problem requires an outstanding solution beyond science.

At least he still has his pants

Sorry but why brock? The n-word?

Or literally half the brawlers in the game

Must've been really hard to win wot 2 maxed brawlers at 390 trophies..

I hate it when people pay so much money so they can get to 500 only by extra demage they deal instead of skill they have

That üòê face tho

It's sad because there is so much potential in this game, but hey we got that new much needed brawler.
---
True.
---
A matchmaking in Gem Grab of mine was a 7 Darryl, 5 Frank and 5 Bull vs. a 10 Tara, 10 Poco and 5 Pam (I was the Darryl). We won and I got the Star Player due to outplays I made.
---
Which means more fun :3

Technically not a super chain, but gj anyway

I feel you

eyyy i opened 70 boxes and got 0 gems, top that i dare you

Send the guy who made it to the ranch

Ma bravo riesci a battere i nabbi

Holy shit but wouldn't she be OP as hell for a Rare?!

Not the first time i see a beyblade jump

They said in brawl talk we need more subs.... He'll be buffed next update.. that's just a teaser Because he said if we ever dream of a Crow buff we need more subs.
---
I agree with it 100%

Looks nice but try to focus on enhancing the game rather than doing those stupid updates with new brawlers. New brawler is good but applying more solo modes (wich is the most important because the chances to find someone who knows how to play are none) is definately going to improve the game.

Thank you man!!

its not enough!!!

well they will change it in the new update, instead of focusing someone randomly (somehow each time I have under 100% hp I get focused to death), they will focus areas where theres the most players.

A needed buff!
---
I‚Äôd really love to know how. I just get jumped by a Shelly bull or primo, every time. Lost like 30 trophies trying to figure out what magic you guys have :/
---
I always get these kinds of matches and always drop like a 100 trophies/day, thats why I only play showdown now
---
Dynamike is not normal type... Its teamming type
---
The crow in the video is maxed, so base damage is being increased by 20 at base, and there‚Äôll be an extra 1 damage per level on top of that. So it‚Äôs 28 bonus damage per dagger at max, 20 bonus damage per dagger at level 1. Doesn‚Äôt seem too huge really.
---
Thicc?
---
I saw this on the apple recommendation page and there are so many things wrong with this article....
---
His poison ticks are 1/4 of the damage of 1 dagger, so when they buff daggers, I think the poison gets buffed too based on that.
---
thanks! :)

that mortis was a big noob he should remove that hat

This Brawl Star's update is soo lame
---
Here is my version : Shelly = Frisk, Spike = Flowey, Pam = Toriel, Darryl = Napstablook Leon =Sans, Poco = Papyrus, Barley = Grillby, Rosa and EL PRIMO = Dogamy and Dogaressa, Penny = Undyne, Jessie = Alphys, Scrappy = MTT Box edition, Carl = Muffet, Rico = MTT EX, Brock = MTT NEO, Tara = W. D. Gaster, Gene = Mad Mew Mew (the Nintendo Switch Exclusive boss), Bo = Asgore, Sakura Spike = Asriel, Crow = Chara. Did I missed some roles?
---
I thout what:
---
pam=tory
---
bull=assgore
---
jess=asriel
---
leon=chrara
---
nita=frisk
---
ryan=gaster
---
derryl=sans

pico=papyrus
---
dino=nd
---
dino's team=mad dummy
---
barley=mtt
---
carl=alfys
---
shelly/rosa=undine...
---
Wait this is literally Carl
---
Now people r gonna ship spike or primo with rosa
---
Yeah cuz gems work differently in clash than in bs, oh get more from chest and it‚Äôs proportionally more
---
üòÇüòÇ
---
Who confirmed it. I have been wondering. If it is rare I'm saving my gems until a deal comes up.
---
Infinite rolling
---
NICE this is one of the best star powers in the game if you learn to use it correctly! It was also my first star power back when star powers where first released! I got it day one of them coming out and I have to say it is 1 of the best for strategic play and just to have fun with! Go practice your jumping in friendlys to get it down and possibly even double jump! Hope you have fun.
---
20/24 all at 500 :P 2 star powers bought

They would say siege not brawl ball.

That happened to me, too.

Their Rosa VS our Rosa

Enemy team Rosa: Boxing Champion
---
Our Rosa: My bare hands

If they just polished that model of Mortis it would have looked sooo cool.
---
Only in 5 tiles range the auto aim works perfectly or you could just be facing a pro player or you aren't dodging well
---
oh no oh fuck. i cant unsee it
---
I've just checked your other skins and i think that you should not change the original brawler skin too much, some skins look like completely different brawlers.
---
why is she looks like a mad scientist?

That‚Äôs hot. That‚Äôs hot

Lol.

Ryan IS literally a meme

Of course
---
It's very easy to identify an autoattack player (my case)
---
No no no dude.  There‚Äôs a lot of stuff wrong with this but by far is the ‚Äúbull and el primo are good carriers‚Äù. No,  no there not. There good aggros, carriers are Jessie Pam penny bo Poco etc, no Simone who has the shortest range in the game.

Idk, I thought chocolate coins would make sense.

Thanks so much

I agree with you and thank you!
---
Nah it‚Äôs really good to harass the enemy with because it hits enemies close to it, Tara‚Äôs star power on the other hand...
---
They should make something to know where the turrets will hit the enemy for penny and jessie.And  to add this to spike too.
---
With knuckle dusters

Wat never heard of life leech I'm new BTW (not really) played when it was released globally
---
"Solo" showdown. "Every brawler for them selves".

"ReSuLtS MaY VaRy"

Me: - 150 trophies

Daddy spike is gonna have to pay child support
---
The symbol of BS would disappear in this way
---
Teamer detected

Yeah, he‚Äôs not good in solo showdown, but he‚Äôs decent in duos
---
Ever heard about dodging, LOL.

Orrrr when you unlock a new brawler above 3k trophies.
---
Ahahahahhaha Green cucumber
---
Loool
---
Then you gotta watch coach cory's latest video, its the easiest solution to fix treaming. He explains it well
---
Yes. I'm just saying this would be a better buff
---
Good post
---
inappropriate song lyrics....***ENGLAND IS M-***
---
He needs Some kind of rework to stand a chance against healers.
---
I don't play solo showdown, I'm just tired of all the entitled brats in supercell games thinking what they do is always right and trying to shit on anybody who doesn't agree. Banning people for doing something that's a minor annoyance?
---
Cool.
---
Looks like he is low riding.

75% of it was fake. There was some stuff that was true, but it was April fools, so yeah
---
Because crow smells a rat.
---
Wtf. Was the first emotion I had. WTF was the second one I had. XD nice work!
---
Well it sound like someone just got their first star power
---
Nvm ok click your profile go to brawlstars subbreddit and then top right corner click the options, change user flair
---
That would be a good one for mortis
---
its meant to look bad lol, thx for the compliment
---
I have many questions regarding your username
---
It is similar to this one https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/bc87ty/pregame_brawler_selection_concept_when_mathcing/

Says the pam, jk ik bull is pretty simple

I do think the colours need to be brighter though.

This is incredible I never would have thought to do this
---
Thank you Null, very cool!
---
Poor spike
---
Oi, I thought the same. When I saw Rosa I just thought it was one of these skin ideas from Gedi-Kor or something.
---
I want her
---
How do you for Emojis over your skin ?
---
Haha yeah a few games just for fun
---
Yes!

I think he's pointing out the redundant 'lmao' at the end of your sentence but sure.

This is getting cringey

Nobody:

JK Rowling: Colt was a single mother
---
I still dont have him... 4000 trophies
---
That means that the next brawler will be super rare, mythic, or legendary üòØ
---
If you  kill them before they kill others it discourages them
---
God please yes
---
**smiles in espa√±ol**

*clears throat* mortis

Reminds me of bloons td5 and battle cats conditions
---
Do we have any idea on a Rosa release date?
---
üò≥
---
That's why I called it chaos lmao
---
They‚Äôre permanent
---
When you get a star power it means the the brawler is level ten so you always have it. Hope this helped
---
why just why
---
Oh wow! Thanks!
---
Was it the quenchiest?

*THE* quenchiest :D

Update for brawl stars: stops teamers, remodels bo, adds 2 new skins, new brawler
---
the community: haha the clash royale update is so much better

update for brawl stars: am i a joke to you?

I already told you how

I‚Äôll upload one next week :) ‚ÄîProbs going to be about gem hunting!
---
Instead of having a play button they should have a ‚Äúmake random team button‚Äù which assigns you to a team of randoms, and then you are able to chat and pick brawlers/gamemode as if you chose from your friends list, and this way they don‚Äôt have to make a separate tab or screen they just put it in the normal one.
---
Just imagine *fanart*, *shudders*...
---
#FBI OPEN UP
---
Probably get downvoted  For this but idc. Why tf cant people be grateful for once? By the time CR released one update brawl stars has released 2, introducing 2 new brawlers, a new game mode, gameplay improvements, 3-5 new skins, new remodel, new maps and new voices. CR released one big update and ur complaining. For BS it‚Äôs either wait 2 months for a big update (which everyone seems too impatient for). Or constant monthly updates with new content to keep the game refreshing.  But you can‚Äôt complain at the devs when they have delivered another solid update
---
Jessie just wants to get junky. What about your cool ass?
---
friends of brawl stars I have a doubt I have the highest percentages for an epic brawl and it does not come out for more than two months I DO NOT HAVE ANYTHING
---
Sorry piper, this one is defective. We'll take him back to base.
---
When you post it you get 1k upvotes, when I posted it a month ago I get 5 and people saying it‚Äôs a dumb idea because it would make gene take no skill
---
Fraud and forgery is piracy
---
Except they leaked crow buff today soooooo.....
---
Oh? You're approaching me?
---
No one likes teamers
---
Not really brain dead or no-skill, he's just easy brawler to use. But you still need some skills like dodging, patience for ambushing, and apply his super to approach or escape
---
can't wait for the meteor rework
---
Al fin we
---
thanks for the comment, I will correct the filter nxt time.

Where i see this idead.......

Mortises are toxic around these towns!

Did you figure it out yet

Read op‚Äôs reply

Yes

maybe over convidence?

Sorry better delete it üòÖ
---
You all are saying I‚Äôm mean but just be honest with yourself. I‚Äôm thirteen and could probably draw that in one minute.
---
Looks like the Fortnite skin
---
This is a poor idea
---
someone disagree with you
---
2 reasons: 
---
First one is probably because you didn‚Äôt use the idea flair tag, flair tags help people find what they are looking for and if you don‚Äôt put one, your post will just get burried and lost.
---
Second reason is that you just drew without giving it any shape or something, I made it look like it‚Äôs an actual hit marker.

Gene players like you make me want to break my phone

But genius strategy none the less

Like crow

That would be way too strong

Free stuff pls

I dunno man. In siege and brawl ball this think owns

Omg I‚Äôm shaking and crying right now. Bo and Pam would never do this üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
---
I would just say: no.. the Game would be broken then.. and brawlers like gene, Tara.. well obviously every game would be useless somehow.. just get one sneaky with Mortis and give it to ur mate like no reason to play gem grab anymore üòÖüòÇüòÇü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I smell #PESTILENCE
---
Hoooow....
---
For starts the movement speed would be broken, it would also make the mode less consistent as it is already quite strategy based it‚Äôs only once you get past insane II that it becomes more strategy. Also you could get people playing both sides to farm coins it wouldn‚Äôt be fair.
