Lol

Ok now this is funny
---
I wanted to make a free space heist map
---
Definitely has a lot of influence. Mortises attack is very unique so adding another brawler with a dash attack seems reasonable. The pouncing feature has some of the crow mechanics but bouncing back creates a whole new layer that is unlike any super in the game. I also feel like being able to would an opponent (similar to poison and burn) adds a new animation to the game.
---
Imo no. The difference is this meta is starpowers, so usually in Low trophies it‚Äôs fine. But Rosa was the brawler, and she was ridiculously easy to get and OP, meaning it affected all trophy ranges
---
My data is good tho and the WiFi logo happens whether you use data or WiFi

Nita on a pita ? üòÇ

the only thing that really matters is tick nerf. the buffs are really unnecessary and the debuffs are minuscule in gameplay
---
Just accept other languages dude. You wouldn't want to be talking in English to somebody else then having somebody make fun of it. That's just rude, and we don't need rudeness on this subreddit

I guess I should have said All boxes I'm opening...

That was a joke lol
---
Do the funny heal!!
---
bibi didn't needed an hp nerf, as a crow main now i can push my crow higher after the buff, and tara finally getting a buff now she will be everywhere in the meta, and i think 8bit doesn't need to be nerfed cause any nerf to his main attack will make him useless cause of his extremely slow speed
---
Yea once I got on brawl tv it was around 450 viewers and I was so happy
---
Can someone link me this picture, I want to use it but I don‚Äôt want to steal this guys work

mom? are you saying that leon's mom is tara from another dimension

*jazz music stops*

Sorry :,(

I mean... He looks like POS, but clickbaiting and racism? Yeah, he is not a good person, but honestly I was expecting worse from "worst YouTuber", like paedophilia, constant hate speech, having child workers, idk

Hindu isn't a language. It's a religion.

What's the use of reload speed buff if you need to be at full ammo to get it? like bruh.

I mean, I dont think it's a good idea to make him a partner.

you should probably just delete this post and post it the next day since its night and it won't get noticed.

People like wonderbrad do so too, though, and it took months for him to get his CCode
---
What when you got it? Mime 0.112 when i got spike from box.

i love this

It‚Äôs been higher but ever since I got gene it flopped.

Digit spun and escaped the FBI

Yes I just went through a cold spell.

They probably partnered him based on his sub and/or view count. I don‚Äôt think any of them speak German
---
same with loaded rico
---
JOE MAMMA!! Ok I‚Äôll stop
---
Finally a person who makes an idea and properly illustrates them
---
If you have max power points for every brawler this is normal
---
Gene is a make tho
---
Congrats I had a similar case to you I got mortis out of a star token box and crow out of a mega box and 8-bit minutes later which all of this happened at the day they released 8-bit
---
This doesn‚Äôt seem the least bit fair, considering I‚Äôve been unlucky long enough to get max power points for all brawlers, and now just get useless coins from a big box
---
Wonderbrad and Lex are the only funny ones tbh.
---
And Wonderbrad is actually a decent player.
---
That's fly
---
Nope . When you buy something from the shop , your main account would receive just 5% , so if you create a new account , and buy a big box with 30 gems , you will receive just 1,5 gems , which I think that are 2 gems . Are those infinite gems ? (:
---
But then it spawns you at the other side if the map and theres only 15 seconds left
---
Isn‚Äôt it EA?

Clash games Mutter hat ihn bei der Geburt 10 mal hoch geworfen aber nur 5 mal gefangen und er spielt Minecraft mit Goldr√ºstung. Ich finde puuki w√§re ein besserer Partner, auch wenn er ab und zu clickbait mach, oder Lukas aber nd der Typ.
---
Yah ppl are passionate
---
"well balanced". This brawler is clearly OP and not balanced at all. Nice idea and art but it needs a huge rework.
---
Hiw is thatop? Its 1000 dmg over walls, more than dyna
---
Lol knew but there's only one guy with 500 trophy brawler matchmaking paired them with 3 500 trophy brawlers as the enemy team had 2 low trophy brawler they should have been paired at least with 300 trophy brawlers
---
No one asked you
---
Is this inspired by Celeste? Looks really similar to it
---
Better than I can do lol
---
Pro tip: The jessie should have waited till the leon got visible and scored the goal :D
---
Walk on water? More like Jesus lol 
---
btw walkin on water  = OP just get a closed ranged brawler around and go in the middle water if there is and stay away from close brawlers by being into water :D
---
daaaamn
---
Pula
---
I will stand by what i said
---
whoops that should be facing the other way
---
Yeah but i needed to fix the size of the pic so now you can xoom alot better
---
Finger thinkers. Register here
---
but it was one simple game xD
---
What i was saying was that if you have 500+ and play with two 0 trophies friends in your team they will find you a match with three 500+ players
---
He's not a clickbaiter
---
Titans use darryls roll knockback att the end
---
Damn, dude. They can't just think of a better person than HIM, yeah right.
---
Oooooo I understood thx
---
Should her Super have a duration?
---
&lt;-- daniel
---
the cooler daniel --&gt;
---
Then you clearly dont know anything about balancing
---
With Pico's consistent splash damage in areas where he's viable (think brawl ball or gem grab, especially bb where enemies tend to group up) even just the sight and heal delay is a huge advantage, and 1200 damage was nothing to sneeze at, with 3 shots and pre nerf Screeching Solo Poco could pump out massive damage and consistently get his super over and over when he can get multiple shots, which he still can but with the damage nerf to Screeching Solo it's just not as impactful as before unless you're now also healing your teammates while using it.
---
Though aren't they stupid enough to play with these low trophy low lvl brawlers
---
I got 20 upvotes on my previous leon update. I really appreciate it :)
---
Darryl can do it too
---
I don't see how this is support but ok
---
Why is this getting downvoted lmao
---
This is really nice
---
This is literally impossible
---
It supports me to play more with leon.
---
I tought it was a bug because i got the ambush star power after the buff
---
if you have low health then yes. hitting 3 consecutive shots with piper isn't easy.
---
Im older some 15 years than u and we all know that u are noob who is teaming and have no skill‚ù§
---
Doesn't make any sense
---
Double apologies?
---
Piper can deal over 6000 damage without power up at level 7
---
Uh just to make it clearly I know people are gonna like my progress with hin so I do more.
---
Oh yeah here comes the 12 year old who claims to be a lawyer's kid and has 17.6k trophies. The guy with the Leon profile picture who has joined CoachCorySubmissions. Yes, I'm totally scared of this lying kid.
---
It's mystery to me how we should know this in a picture. Can you just buy a stress ball or something and leave your cancer posts to yourself? Thank you
---
oh no
---
Oh hey, MissStealYoTrophies!
---
who are you \[thanks by the way
---
They know
---
you can but only on open maps .you are talking about stats ,you are not looking at real game situations. brawlers like gene mortis leon nita throwers poco darryl sandy can make short work of her.
---
who are you but thanks
---
can someone recreate this map and ask to bring back don't judge, but in 2018 octoberish maybe i started and then i stopped for like 1 year but that was my favorite map (are they going to bring back the thing where you could see the skins when you select characters)
---
Dynamike‚Äôs Santa skin already throws gifts for its super tho
---
Thanks for your art post! If you are not the creator of this work, please make sure that you have included the source, or to  comment it here! Unsourced art may be removed if you are not the creator.

They will be eliminated anyway becuse her super is always ready
---
Should have been a mortis
---
...what.
---
I don't know. SP and the turret actually stack but I don't know of the drink further increases your DMG.
---
I would definitely pay 150 gems for this
---
hey

Removed - DO NOT SUBMIT POSTS WITH TITLES IN ALL CAPS. CAPS LOCK IS CRUISE CONTROL FOR COOL

i was expecting coiled snake mortis but ok
---
In my opinion, it's the lvl 75 pack

Oh my god these posts are so annoying. Obviously the Nita was in a party with someone and made the matchmaking unbalanced. These posts are so meaningless and don‚Äôt add anything to help the game

No it remains same. Proof go to help and sup, start a conversation, when brawlers,brawl boxes and shodown comes click on it, then click drop rates and you will see in the text that brawlers purchased will not affect the rates.

Yeah xddd

not with his super

If everyone has the skin it doesn't have any value as it becomes the default one, the skin everyone has. Lunar new year brock or darryl have a lot of value because a few players have those for example.

She just YEET it like full on through sat gene and just kills him

Any token doubler deal for sale is a great deal

Yeah I'm also fed up that a simple screenshot or a repetitive low effort meme can get thousands of upvotes but art doesn't. The thing is that you shouldn't worry about some internet points, you won't get anything from it. Just do what you like, if that's drawing, and post it here even if you don't get many upvotes.

It's a meme. Basically, if you ask who Joe is, they tell you JOE MAMA. It's really stupid, but people like it, so...

Sandy?

Thanks, but photoshop experts can easily take it out lol

Poco Gang rise up! More than just a useless healer...
---
It's a meme. There isn't a new supercell worker. Joe is a meme. When you ask who he is, they tell you JOE MAMA.
---
I dont know
---
Nope. If you save gems you can buy them. I have most skins and I'm F2P playing since last June. I don't buy every single mega box offer or token doubler, I only buy skins and I have plenty 150 and 80 gems skins. Just don't waste them in every single opportunity you have. Save them for every update so that you can buy a dope skin that they release. I currently have 98 waiting for Halloween skins and my friend has 204 saving up till then(F2P).
---
 " Robo fugu " what language is that
---
Looks good! I wonder what his attack will be

i think they nerfed his star power too much a super duration nerf would have been enough

Ya I know i hope I will dont care about them in future...
---
Buy skins is waste skins not equal wins I am saving them to buy the shark Leon but a good token doubler offer comes and I have to buy it to progress
---
And that is why I still use top hat mortis
---
originally ambush was +400 but yeah I guess it‚Äôs 2796
---
That's crazy. He must be pretty unlucky.
---
Swearing or being toxic could be apart of that.
---
Not that impressive IMO. You dodged some and got hit by quite a lot. Was expecting you to not get hit.
---
You probably swore on chat and now you are acting like a victim. Man up and serve your time you little shit.
---
This so cool! I love it!
---
....even though your at full health
---
He‚Äôs saying that stars above their head is the tiebreaker if they have the same amount of total stars
---
More like *Our Battle Will Be Epic*
---
but now with the 60% buff, i think some of pro players would perfer Ambush instead of Snappy Sniping. Killing a El Primo or getting a Sponge Frank at critical hp with 3 shots is nice to be honest.
---
Even above 500 I see a good number of people "hiding" with the ball, especially when sandy came out the num er of people trying to sneak with the ball in his super was ridiculous.
---
Hi

I felt the need to do it lol
---
Rocket No. 4? Every single bullet will hit if you get close to Colt and Rico? Piper Super? Jessie and Penny turrets? And only if you have Coiled Snake right? I have a f\*cking rank 26 power 6 Mortis and I don't have powerpoints. I  have around 5000 coins, so you see I NEED POWERPOINTS. In the 800 trophy range, everyone has f\*cking star power, so I can only KS.
---
I played with a guy with that name before
---
Still many people have posted these elf on a shelf memes and they became annoying
---
Wut...
---
Why does Darryl kill with his hat
---
Just have a bunch of Brawlers who have splash and shots that don't insta kill (Dyna, Barley, Poco, Frank, etc.) all next to each other. That could work, but it might end up that one guys kills the rest. You never know.

You needing power points is your problem. Then don't play Mortis until you get those points?
---
What are you proposing? That Mortis should have enough damage to 3 shot Jessie? I've seen Mortis wipe entire teams in Bounty and Gem Grab. It's not the brawler's fault that you're playing a power 6 Mortis in 800 trophies and expecting to win consistently.
---
What dude? Relax, everybody here it‚Äôs  like he haven‚Äôt got any better thing to do except hate inocent gusys with their drawings

Thank you!

Really send link
---
Ayyy Someone who has my opinion on that guy :D
---
Basically I tried to get a Leon from the Shark Leon event from him but he completely fucked up how to give it away:
---
He "randomly" picked someone from the stream chat, even though he literally said that the conditions were to send a comment under his shark leon stream announcement video, where you'd pretty much opt in for the giveaway. The Random picking from the stream chat (with no software or some sort of program mind you) could have been rigged since he did it himself and could've searched for one of his friends instead of an actual random person
---
I hate that guy and I'm ashamed he's one of the only brawl stars youtubers here in germany

His buff is good because now in combination with the carrion crow star power he can actually be good
---
^

Huhuhuhuhuuuhuhu

Yeah! That would be insane! XD
---
Is it possible to learn this power....Also.....Hes to dangerous to be kept alive
---
Whew! I've got Crow and Spike.
---
I swear it looks like a pop up ad. WIN A SKIN!!!!
---
But you didnt liked the post
---
Lmao
---
Yeah ur right, the fact that the Rosa's name is Ash made me believe that this is indeed Ash's video, this guy stole it and tries to llay victim
---
Now you got it. Much better than 10/2
---
Don‚Äôt forget that dynamite is like 90 years old and his spine is compressed as fuck
---
My dude you took it from another video
---
It is directed from center point of Frank as he is big his center point meet with wall easy which can destroy it and stun brawler within his center point I always stun mortis that way in brawl ball.
---
Man one day you'll get, yesterday I got my first with 12k
---
I see you're a man of culture
---
Agreed about werewolf/supernatural
---
He IS somewhat treated like a legendary, as in that most people say they would have gene over crow because gene is better.

Well guess you are right,but there are some total noobs who unlock leg at  &lt;1000k trophies. Brawl Stars should drop brawlers based on your win rate or something.

I can send one for free since you asked nicely. I was thinking about printing 3 for a giveaway since it turned out pretty nice and the material costs are negligible. But I'm not sure if giveaways are ok in this sub. DM me your address and I will hook you up.

Am I the only one who thinks these posts are annoying?

I guess so...
---
Thanks man!
---
I don't agree that Bibi is anti-Darryl cuz she can knock him away, but she can't kill him quickly due to his health and the Steel hoops star power. But yes, I agree that he needs a buff. Probably a Steel Hoops or Rolling reload  buffs

 Nice art

Good idea. Not necessary.

Removed. Keep your post titles descriptive and provide context. Additionally do not use low effort/all caps/clickbait titles.

me too mate me too i almost lag every match on 4G/LTE
---
Got my first at 5000, got my second at 12000. I really don't deserve this luck.
---
Nope he only has withe skin 
---
And he can stay under the sun
---
*Epico*
---
He‚Äôs a kid. Just let him be, man
---
How come this great art just get few hundreds of upvote!
---
This is an amazing skin, but the only problem is that there would be copyright issues if the skin got added
---
if you want to grind boxes fast wait for a ticketed event like big game or robo rumble
---
So true üòÇüòÇ
---
I honestly hate this and feel like it's super rude. You're waisting their time by doing this. If they close the app, they don't even get tokens for losing. So they just have to sit and wait because you're cocky? How does this help anyone? How does this benefit the progression of the game? You literally could have put the ball in, gotten out, picked another brawler, and started a new game in the amount of time you held it. It's just inconsiderate at this point. I get spinning a little for fun, but this was ridiculous.
---
Boi This is too good üòÜ
---
Laugh in poco with screeching solo
---
Now I might be going on a limb here, it you MIGHT have lost because of the 198 Pam. Just a thought please do not crucify me. :^ )
---
And Rush Wars...it‚Äôs not Even available for the whole world
---
Blame your mistakes on others, duh
---
BROOOO i think sanndy needs a buff
---

---

---
my friend crow vs sandy... he won
---
LOL THAT ARE FACTS
---
That is the stupidest fucking thing ive ever seen
---
Last 2 days for me
---
bibi is a kid :/
---
How many trophies?
---
This has brought back my SD PTSD
---
I do consider myself very lucky! I was not expecting him
---
Tick is Arabian, silly.
---
*No, I don't think i will*
---
*Honestly though*, 7.5
---
You forget to sighing
---
uhh... just look up xtil xtil on twitter and youll find nita uhhhhh naked and uhhh
---
*NOW this is an advengers level comment*
---
They couldn't nerf duration without doing a full update.
---
8 I think is the shortest they can go. 10bi think is optimal.
---
Yeah sure I'll do it for you if that's what you want!
---
The digital version is there
---
Hbd bro
---
Yeah they probably will but they couldn't change the duration without doing an actual update on the app store. Don't ask me why
---
Frank lookin  T H I C C
---
Idk if you screen shotted the last part of mortis super or if you actually caught that
---
That‚Äôs actually pretty awesome
---
A comment that *doesn‚Äôt* involve breasts (shocking, right)
---
This *genuinly* freaking good art

Why? Getting 1000 token doublers gives you one mega box worth, so if I bought 2000 token dubs, I would‚Äôve used 100 gems for two mega boxes worth
---
a gummy bear + showdown = no f..... way!
---
F
---
Wow haha so funny this meme has already been made
---
When they released the skin it was 429 lol -10 gems
---
That leon looks real irritating
---
No.

u/THE_5050 you're welcome

Hi Kairos

Yes, discounted mega box is a bit better than normal doublers, but discounted doublers are better than discounted mega boxes (and come more often)
---
Yes he maybe op but let him have his time to shine for over 9 months he never got a chance

*batter up*

When she found out didn‚Äôt get nerfed but in fact got a buff...

tHeRe AlReAdY aRe SkUlLs
---
The map contest is a total whack right now
---
I would, i payed 700 gems for sandy and i would take this offer any day. Although i already have leon its still a good offer.
---
Nice idea! Looks fun, but mind the one tile gaps
---
Discounted doublers always come out when I don‚Äôt have gems, at least That what it feels like, but you‚Äôre right, I forgot about the discounted doublers
---
Please don‚Äôt upvote this. This is a traced version of the drawing by r/freealand. OP probably just printed out a copy and traced it. 
---
It‚Äôs pretty clear when you look at OPs and the original. This is yet another case of stollen art
---
You don‚Äôt have any mythics? Wow...
---
what I really like about this mode is how karmic it is
---
Then wait for it to come into rotation at full price
---
*dies internally...again...*

#I T S  H I G H N O O N
---
DID YOU JUST CALL PINGU A WEEB?
---
Not really, looks like OP put some effort into it.
---
Yeah I'm at 11k and I'm practically stuck I can only push my brawler so far till they just go back at the end of the season
---
But he just put music and lyrics
---
I have 0 clue what the fuck this is...
---
I have leggies but it is Anouilh getting star powers they are common
---
still, it has more effort than those shit meme templates where you just put text in the blank space and get ton of upvotes.
---
Guys... I‚Äôm shaking
---
True, but just cuz it's less shitty doesn't make it not shitty
---
Ofc. U meant at least i have leon i guess. And mortis.
---
Back in the 90 there was an arcade cabinet/game called 'Mad Dog McCree'; it was one of those games based on video-events; later Konami brough the 'Lethal Enforcer' series to arcade and consoles. Those pink and colored gun were it¬¥s trademark.
---
Wow Thanks! My dad said he would be home after work to take me to the park and never came back! Turned out he died in an accident at work!
---
Finally a mod that (probably) takes care of this sub and tell users what to do and what to not do.
---
No
---
OK the thing is that just yesterday I was compiling a THIRD new star, and that was what it did!! Also, once I post them, I will also be balancing my previous ones. I will make Greedy also make Gene's Super 20% easier to charge up.
---
Nice stolen post.
---
Ah ok makes sense.
---
why not?
---
Thanks, just wondering.
---
knew somebody would ask that
---
YES! so annoying. And the ppl who collect powerpoints in the corner and forget to attack the bot, like what are you doing?
---
The sword and sheath template would have fit this meme better
---
the downvote wasn't neccesary, duh.
---
downvote? where is it?
---
Oh ok thx

For mortis pls
