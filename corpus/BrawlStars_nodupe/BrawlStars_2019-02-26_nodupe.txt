Don't ruin my meme took me 15 minutes to make
---
F
---
Umm wheres the iq mike?
---
Crow is useless. Literally lost 80 trophies in 1 sitting
---
I apologise....it’s a lovely meme! 👍🏻 especially if it gets Crow a buff!
---
Thanks for the support
---
**I smell a rat**
---
Oui c'est le gemme pour ceux qui ont ouvert des box a partir du shop pendant que d'honneur était retirer du jeu 
---
i released a small amount of air from my nostrils
---
What if they just sat on the map, like little tombstones! That would be cool. 
---
Yessir
---
I LOVE your work man,very great details!
---
Jessie evolves into Pam
---
I love you both
---
Trust me crow is useless. Was my highest brawler at 480 and guess what? Played a few matches with pros but also against pros and down to 406...
---
Then explain why you can see the dynamike in the bush. Come on
---
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahha🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣
---
*big box 
---
Agree! 
---
Nita-&gt;Crow-&gt;Leon
---
Why does it say they won but on the tokens it says defeat 
---
Must ban that teaming Mortis. He must not be a member of the gang
---
The kid who pretend to be a ninja by throwing fidget spinner and stole Harry Potter's Invisible cloak
---
Yea but for me (personally) it’s hard in showdown
---

---
Bs post screenshot

"Give me money or I'll go afk"
---
Was sitting in the same room as my friend playing showdown with Leon at abou 500 trophies. We’re in the same match so I went out of my way to kill him 
---
Lol
---
To scare dynamikes more
---
That don’t won’t if a bull comin at you
---
U/BlueRobotics 
---
But that’s not a matter of symmetry, that’s a matter of map balance. 
---
I see you on every single brawl stars post 
---
I defeated a bull btw (but he was n00b.)
---
.
---
Teamer 😔
---
Doesn’t have to be symmetrical, just needs to be a balanced map on either side.   Restricting maps to symmetry removes half of the creativity from the dev team, and from the game. 
---
Excuse me it's groundhog burrow.
---
(Humor)
---
Why everyone is making sea Leon’s since I made my skin v:&lt;. Just kidding. Still I invite you to see my concept xd
---
I am still working on the map and feedback just like this really helps me! I deleted a few boxes or replaced them so they are equally spread across the map/town. Gonna upload it soon
---
So cool
---
That’s my boi’s
---
what was the original thing in the space where crow is?
---
KIAN MY MAN 
---

---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Nice drawing! I just have some questions 
---
1. Did you use copic markers? If not what did you use to color it 
---
2. Is this traced? 
---
3. How long did this take 
---
Gonna go with Ghost Town Gambling and it honestly looks much better 😉
---
Haha no need to mention me, was sorting by new and this was the first post.  
---
However, I requested the "to be continued" meme (examples is https://youtu.be/82ISpg1VdrE), not the airpods one 😅 But I think this one is more relevant nowawdays. Good meme!
---
Death, more like satan
---
Holy crap that looks stunning. Great work
---
This is too a2some of an idea for supercell to do
---
Ok..?
---
Alright, it's what I wanted.
---
Oh shit thats good 
---
all brawlers has a gang subreddit 
---
Visit r/BrawlGang for more info

I was surprised at first like u
---
Somone does some stRATEGY FOR A LOT OF BRAWLER HIS NAME HIS.
---
Exactly, saying it out loud sounds like bow
---
Create a second channel now in case of a Third strike
---
Wow.. cant wait to see more! Yes i like more violent badass dark theme skins but i gotta say this is done well and its worth the effort! Keep up! I would like to see next skin for Piper.. maybe like Nurse Piper or Bewitcher Piper 
---
Overall this is AMAZING imma follow u dude ❤
---
Good idea
---
I love how people have all these great idea and they’re never implemented 
---
haha
---
Ngl, this looks like it was made in the 90s
---
u/Artemis 
---
Lol I still call it that
---
I know I'm not saying you're not. I'm just saying don't say their name or make any references to them. They're going to copyright strike you for some trash reason. &lt;3

Cancer
---
Since when was mortis a gardener lmao
---
I am dumb so i dont get how is little bro linked with this
---
Can anyone explain 
---
Thnx
---
100% agree. I love the map how it is currently but for whatever reson people dont like that its not symmetrical because its not "fair" I made a cool brawl ball map with a wall that looked like "\" with grass on both sides and people didint like it for the same reson. Just had some spare time and wanted to see what it would look like. But I do 100% agree with you. 
---
This reply is bias

---
Hey i had the same idea i made a month back, the only problem is that yours looks better than mine
---
Weird flex but ok :( At that time my highest brawler was in the 300s
---
I really wish they'd revert his super back to what it usually did. Nothing more rewarding than curbstomping a brawler with 5 bottles when they come charging at you.
---
Oh well. 
---
😳 DAYUM POCO LOOKIN A LIL FRESH THOUGH 😳
---
Oh wow I hadn't actually seen this before, I love the colors of his jacket!
---
hey, a powercube is talking guys
---
I got spike during like the first 5 months of beta
---
Where did you hear this?¿?¿
---
HAT LYFE
---
Looks like he's making a ...  "Seductive" or "come at me" pose
---
I'm done I tried to scroll to the side 
---
Honestly cheerios hurt more than uno cards
---
Im just surprised Leon is the first brawler to lose
---
Who is this guy? Did someone know his channel or something? I wanna know haha
---
\+2 wow if they lost it would be VERY long matchmaking and they would have to win 4 times in a row to get any trophy gains
---
just think about dat

So many maps are like this; double trouble really is what they say, teamers everywhere. There are a ton of teaming Mike's on wall maps, cavern churn and feast or famine are too RNG.....PLAY 3V3 SHOWDOWN IS ASS.

Why?

Rockabilly is like top hat, i doesn't matter that he doesn't have a hat.

They said it themselves, check the survey in news

#Amazing as heck bro!
---
 But dyna could survive the poison by super jumping in the middle and he and barley can easily attack other brawlers. Plus he can jump in and out of the buildings.
---
At that time my highest was a max trophy 500 primo. I remember there were only like 2 other 500 primos so I showed off to all my friends :P
---
Yes, you are absolutely right! I already saw this problem by myself, I wanted to spread the boxes equally, but forgot to focus on the thing you called "high risk- high reward". I changed some things for example the huge box count in this one little house (now: 1 box spot) or the box count in the middle (around the lake there are +4 box Spots)

without string tension, the arrow wouldnt go anywhere, it would just fall to the ground

Quite a shame to see people abusing the Copyright system. Contact YouTube about this and there is a chance they'll take care of it.
---
I literally don't see anything that Tweenky or this Hélio Inácio Costa person could copyright based on the names. If it's because of video title, it still remains without reason. I've seen many videos with the same title.

I love the statistics concept

Ok now give us the source

Hi AMAZING 500/10 concept!! Mind if I give you full credit but repost it to give this a little more attention???

This looks amazing! It also seems really nice that you'd be able to see how many people own the given skin and the release date of the skin. :D

# HOLY CROW
---
She's number one by far
---
if they allowed that you wouldnt want to know what i would say to teamers

What same people in match oh god that make sense

If you are defeated wait for some time to take revenge ho

Ha ha ha ha

Oh yea turning up the boombox.

I can surely say that this is coming to the game. Probably during Halloween this year.. .!!!
---
IM A CREATURE OF THE NIGHT

That's a great star power shelly  breaking cannon! Boom splashed.

This would allow several skins to be added rather than just 3!

It's an old image, look at Spike

I thought they were donuts.

Yes congrats

Imagine when leon uses his ult : a cloud of bubbles form and dissolve as he turns invisible, and in the player's retrospective the fin is visible above the ground like a shark.

The only thing I dislike is that he won but got defeat tokens. Buddy you got scammed.

Getting 1k brawlers isn't that crazy of an idea anymore. Tons of people have done it, but rarely are they played again lol

Well I think you can to also a bug there (Tara Dynamike)
---
I like it ton, a skeleton-ton
---
How did you know he would come out? I mean you knew so you recorded, right?
---
Can you share your club with me?
---
Thats something SUP ERC ELL would need to figure out, I’m not really sure whats fair, maybe a timed ban on matchmaking.
---
That's literally what I said, but yeah
---
No, you are wrong.

??? How is this 300 IQ

I don't really want to be banned or anything but I think a comment is Okay right?
---
Mortis, I think u can still use him since there’s a bot limit
---
no
---
Thanks 🙏 
---
Her range is so annyoying. Plus the reload time is so fast. I have seen Pam in all modes Gem Grab. Heist.Bounty.Brawl Ball and SD too. She needs nerf for sure
---
this is great 
---
There are just too many strategies that keep you from gaining skill. Even if you play aggressively, you don't learn about team compositions and chemistry, and there's a lot of downtime where you're either in a bush or looking for an opponent. Solo is just usually not as intense as 3v3 modes, and has a completely different playstyle.
---
When you’re over 500 every brawler and the season restarts there are drops of 2k or more
---
Your post has been removed, make sure to use the body of a post to elaborate on the title.
---
Even though you are always blue on your screen, the computer does something called true blur or true red where you can either be on true red side or true blue side. In clash royale sometimes placements are a bit off for some buildings whether you are on true blue or true red. I guess its the similar for BS where one side may have a disadvantage.

Tweenky is idiot

Woow. Toppp

I guess he doesn’t have sunglasses anymore. 
---
I need this!!
---
But you'd be missing Dynamike and Bo at 1k trophies?
---
the skin didn’t have sunglasses from the start. he still had the animation on it tho
---
feel free to r/woooosh me if this is me missing the joke 
---
Nice work keep it up
---
im so sorry please dont slaughter me
---
Supercell condones teamming, so just team away since we players did everything we could to stop it and youtuber even went against about it but sc just dont care
---
😂😂😂😂
---
Btw how do u get the crow icon next to ur name because I want one
---
Press this -&gt; r/brawlstars, then click the 3 dots all the way in the top right. A menu will come up from the bottom, and the third choice down says change user flair. Press that, then select the brawler you want to have as your flair.
---
Thanks 👍
---
What
---
How long does he attacks ?
---
Guys,upvote this so that everyone can know about this

I got a 3k shelly main on my team my last match and I'm nearly 11k

Most of the time. Lost so many trophies. Server is s\*\*t

honestly I just ask Sector himself, because I’m in a discord server with him and some additional friends

I have T Poses of mortis top hat, rockabilly, El Rudo, Frank, Leon, Nita, Bull, Jessie, Bo, Barley and Lunar New Year Brock

Had no idea that's an actual subreddit, definitely subscribing
---
Yeah, In Game its Dark Blue
---
Man, that's a Cool idea! But you forgot the star Power.
---
That's Dope.... Supercell should consider it!! 😯😯
---
Tweenky is trash
---
How can you say gold is gained fast enough? Tell me all the places you can get gold from?
---
No it's just they've been ranting to redditors who post leon skins that leon is and can only be a chameleon.
---
RIP your epic brawlers
---
Omg what the fuck? How did the same players get matched twice in a row? That is literally impossible,that must be a glitch or sth. You must report it to supercell holy shit
---
Water is horrible in brawl ball

love this so much

Shut up reposter

You cant make her Star Power stronger than Jessie's

Maybe the bombs land more accurately instead, or make the coins spread in 5 directions  instead of 3

F for you

When you play with random :

Darryl and Bull could be stuck with the safe :o
---
"Watch your manners!"
---
Uhh if you know who is SrPelo please tweet him to make  bruh Stars in a shellnut
---
But if the kills are done with the help of your partner, the cup is taken by the one who kills if and maybe it’s not you
---
Same here, I was the local 2nd crow but it show me 4th because of this.
---
How about whenever you hit someone with mortar, you gain back one ammo back
---
still need to reload after shot
---
Upvote to save Piper!
---
It is totally fucked,I have Crow with starpower and het his health in friendly battles is still 2880. Pls fix
---
That's a good one 
---
I ment backstab eachother, say u killed some1 together and they got the kill then u killed teammate so u got a +1 trophy anyhow 
---
No, thank YOU for this art
---
It's amazing idea 
---
I'm f2p and I've been in the Boom Bandits since last year. Started playing around second half of 2018 a few months before global.

THE NOSTALGIA....AAAAAA

It's literally just 5 more seconds to exit and rematch
---
Colt suicided with his revolvers???
---
Good
---
You're doing it exactly fine, team and backstab as soon as you get the certain kill. The best way to stop teaming is betraying teamers.
---
3k+ hehe but primo at 500
---
Competition

**Bro.** Bro bro bro bro bro. Listen.

I don't care.

That's awesome, any good tips?

Both are decent. "I want everything free and now!"

Thanks for the support! I will backstab even more

---
Yeah ive noticed that too, I reckon we are chucked in last minute to avoid games starting with 9 people. Like maybe its because individuals close their application so we are selected really late. 
---
For what its worth, my game does lag out with the connection icon appearing at the top, and I am in the same room as my router. (86.7Mbps in my last speed test). This happens mainly in 3v3...
---
Veey nice, Good job 🙂
---
how about electro dragon skins with electric blade.
---
I have him too, it is definitely fun but sometimes it just annoys me that I could’ve gotten spike lol
---
Definitely will not 
---
**this is where the fun begins**
---
Decent lel
---
I legit have that same stuff in my shop but different star powers
---
Don't make this game  like Fortnite please!! No need of that...
---
I mean....the battle pass was literally a question on the supercell brawl stars survey. Whether people would be interested in buying the pass. And the idea here is not dissimilar to what is being done in Clash Royale. So it's a possibility that the battle pass will have a similar format. Definitely a possibility to see in the future
---
Chill cave is a great map for barley
---
We really need to sequence his GENEOME
---
In games like bounty, gem grab, heist, and brawl ball killing is easy you would gain 1000 with ease. So I think it should only work in Showdown

Well my shelly went from 489 trophies to 390+ real quick when i realized these past 2 days i've been facing a lot of teamers in solo sd. Total bullshit man lol. Wanna quit this game.
---
Nice
---
Higher level??? 
---
they should remove it
---
Simplified version: you’re wrong
---
what do you mean?
---
Be GENEtically different baby!
---
i too am a beta player and have been playong from the soft launch. but idk abut you but crow’s damage is pretty bad. it’s too easily countered. it doesnt matter how well you play, any decent player can easily regen and thwn take you out. 
---
Enemy team didn’t have a creature of the night.
---
r/fuckyoukaren
---
This is awesome!
---
if the brawl pass is coming out i hope it cost like a certain amount of gems or coins so i can stay f2p
---
Howdy Brawlers!

I'm back with another Brawler Spotlight. This time, it's Poco! Please note that this spotlight is for **casual players/beginners**. The way pros use a Brawler is pretty complex and can highly differ from this spotlight.

* Dynamike

* Mortis

* Tara
---
* Shelly

Thanks for reading. I hope you like the spotlights!

I like how someone is complaining ab free stuff 
---
Even people with 8 subs can exploit the copyright system
---
Adidas skins
---
Crow?
---
This is fantastic! I would love to see this in game! A lot of people are complaining that it’s just coping Fortnite, but Fortnite is not he first game to have something like this. And it’s a fantastic way to encourage people to play the game as well as get great rewards for it! I really would like to see a Brawl Pass in game!

Ooh yeah, that's what i'm going to sugested. I just can't find the words for it. Sorry...
---
The boss would be able to get insane amounts of time if they hide in the bushes in the top left, but if that was fixed this would make a great map
---
Oh i forgot!!

Who the hell wants Bo nerfed? He’s really unpowered rn.
---
I know some of you know it but I’ve had may people that didn’t know they could do this so sorry if you already know :)
---
Crow next pls
---
What is this...
---
Maybe this weekend?
---
Where is it?
---
Not just in spectator mode it's in battle because they are no more ???
---
Maybe this weekend
---
stupidity at its finest 
---
*cough* robo boss *cough*
---
Brawl talk means talking about what's in the next update, right?
---
people find it difficult to find partners for 3v3 and showdown is fun. so supercell ignores this issue to coerce people into playing other modes . aka increase player base for other modes.
---
Why are there so many people making maps it's annoying as hell. Like 6 out of 10 posts are about a damn map 
---
Poco is a bad choice for Poco?
---
Seems fake but ok
---
This survey is ridiculous. It’s broken, so it won’t let me take it. I’ve been trying for days to take it.
---
# This Is Not Fortnite
---
This is 
---
All the brawlers with ??? That you see actually have names. It’s just that in showdown supercell cover players names with ??? To help stop teaming. So if there’s 3 shellys and they all have ??? You don’t know which shelly is your teaming scum friend
---
Nani? 
---
I didn't say that lol
---
#S P O O O O O K Y
---
Lol don't tell us to spend money on this game. Wtf why then we have spent so much time waiting for brawlers to unlock. It should be you ppl spend money on this game because you're new
---
Damn it really do be like that sometimes. What’s it like now
---
That’s what supercell wants you to think
---

Yoooo mr krabs why is this subreddit full of shitty paintings man...

At this moment, Mortis knew, he fucked up.

What is SP?

When our mama sang us to sleep but now we’re stressed out!

Star power

Uh

Maybe

This is the type of art that always appears in the game. Congrats men.
---
*DONT WANNA GET A BAD TIME KID!*
---
 Let me know your opinions ;)
---
Your right!
---
Thnx I can post now haha
---
Remember tap to shoot? Thats nostalgia!
---
Hmmmmmmmmmmmmm?
---
Congrats 🥳
---
This* lol 👌😂
---
Oooh. Ok. I'll record trophy count too.
---
Tfw you see all this posts about buffing Crow but you don't even have Pam when your legendary percentage is higher than your mythic.
---
This has to be the skin name hahah
---
Wtf???
---
Cyka Blyat
---
Im pretty sure barley is called barley because hes a bar tender
---
New region hype!
---
Don't forget that Tara has the n word pass, making her stronger than Pam.

I sadly got 41 gems :(

CROW GANG💪😤💪😤💪
---
OOF
---
Hehe

If you look closely you'll see the spikes of his main attack are wisps! :)
---
Given the abilities I would bet it’s an epic
---
Always glad to see credit even if your idea was original as well! Props
---
I have Jessie power 8 and 83 boxes saved up. 
---
My Jessie is 489/550 (missing 61 points), and I soon unlock 75 power points from 6500 trophies reward. 
---
Am I better off putting the points on Jessie and opening boxes hoping to get star power (essentially "losing" 75-61=14 power points), or putting the points on another brawler (at best lvl 7) and opening boxes to get Jessie to 9.
---
Basically I'm wondering how many boxes (statistically speaking) I'll have to open more or less to get 61 points for Jessie and if it's worth.
---
There is no right answer but I'm looking for your advise! 
---
Ahaan, sure.
---
yup nice
---
+1 Such a beautiful and simple concept! make it happen! u/ryan_supercell
---
Y
---
can you gather all the awesome works at last to have a big group photo?
---
That will be very NICE I think :D
---
Beautiful concept, But it can be other way around, Just doesn't have to be the same as of Fortnite and Pubg's system.
---
Thank you!
---
I didn’t even know that was a thing
---
Isn’t that frank ?
---
I have her on lvl 9 but haven't unboxed her star power yet unfortunately 
---
*Megolavania plays*
---
You super away.
---
Wtf is this game with 20/23
---
I’ve been like that since August
---
No. Sorry if I sounded rude up there, it should be a contructive critic. 
---
I don't know if you know, but there is a sub for posting maps in which the DEV's keep looking.
---
Plow then kachow
---
Thank you 🙏 
---
Everything is better with creature of the night
---
r/mortisgang
---
This want part of the plan
---
There was a plan?
---
That it true, but balancing for the possibility to throw the game has never been a thing. They've made this game easier to play with Autofire, but if youre playing with Randoms you can't always expect to win as there are many Supers that can throw the game (Primo / Crow jumping in w gems, Tara / Frank missing her Super, as well as Randoms just feeding the Enemy team their Super energy). Obviously there will be times where your teammate messes up, but that will always be part of the game regardless
---
Didn't you open a mega box?
---
Dang it forgot my meme quotes to keep this going 
---
Wow that sounds really really unlucky, do you have any sort of proof? 
---
Wow very cool
---
Farming? Really? A man of your talents? 
---
Wehre did u get dat image?
---
Let’s goooo
---
Look at the attack animation next to bull it’s a boomerang 
---
I’m thinking... I think New Brawler is behind the Ryan.You can see attack animation coming from Ryan’s side...
---
WAIT HE/SHE HAS ONE BULLET
---
How did this happen? We're smarter than this! 
---
I’ll try
---
I agree with this. It’s just a problem to me that a huge advantage in power cubes doesn’t really matter when you’re a tank facing a Shelly. Maybe they could widen her shot cone, add some damage, and lower her rate of super recharge. 
---
It’s called the credit card hack
---
Scam

I think that brawl pass would be a well addition; if it has content for f2p players as well.
---
🤔
---
it could litterly be some skin you dont know, plus why do you care so much about what i think
---
Aight, we'll just wait and see
---
I can give you some screenshots, but don't you believe me? Like, why would I lie about this
---
btw its clearly a pickaxe not a boomarang lol
---
The walls can be taken out easily, i don't see a problem here
---
Stolen
---
Best post about this photo I have seen
---
Bam bam be dam bem
---
Thanks for linking it
---
It has a boomerang motion. How it looks like doesn't matter
---
I want to know artis name so I can credit them
---
Read the caption
---
Thank you.
---
Thanks, it’s the first think I thought when I saw it
---
94℅ of attacks wasted on bushes :') 
---
xD
---
jk
---
Thank you. 😊😂
---
I wanna join especially with the shit in mouth 
---
Yus. Poor primo. 
---
the fact that its a pickaxe makes it a pickaxe
---
Do you know the artist?
---
Would be helpful if you did
---
Sorry for the "test" the map is "Insine inside:
---
Yea so then rip to u XD
---
*removed life leech from showdown*
---
I don't see why favoring certain brawlers is bad for a map, but i do agree with the unbalanced walls
---
I don't know man, people in the internet can be weird
---
Cool! I cannot wait to see the new mechanics about new brawler. 
---
Dont we love our stats.  LOL
---
I’m at 8.5k, no legendaries or gene

just search "brawl stars twitter", it should be the last pic they published

Your brawler concept might be the first one to make it into the game, except for the Tara inspiration one. Congrats! 🎉 ❤️

---
really fantastic work. creative community in this sub is lit.
---
me lol
---
Where did you find this?
---
It's a boomerang apparently
---
Yeah.. that's a ULTRA SCUM.
---
Ok i have got other maps in progress but i don't know what name put
---
do you have Leon?
---
if you ever play him in showdown you will realize that it's almost impossible to hit more then 2-3 shots at long range 
---
each one of them dealing about 230 damage, it is literally impossible to compete with Colt,Brock,Piper ect..
---
at long range
---
same like me no mythics. On leggendaries just need crow. 
---
It goes up super slow overtime, but mythics drop the chances of legendaries. 
---
Competetive play 
---
Random game modes: 
---
either Heist,gem grab,bounty or brawl ball 
---
Ur trophies doesnt mather:
---
here u dont lose any trophies here 
---
Instead u have a new trophy system ct (competetive trophies) the more trophies u have the higher rank u are and with that u get higher ur rewards that will be grantes at the end of the season 
---
Rewards:
---
Cp competetive points with that u can buy cool exclusive cosmetics with! But for a high price so grind!
---
HOw dO I geT cP LUL?
---
As i said at the end of the season depending on ur rank and when u win a game u will be grantes a small amout of cp
---
Will i Lose All my progress after a season also how long is a season?
---
Nah u will keep ur rank but at the lowest amout of ct to reach that rank 
---
(also if u lose alot and get ur ct under the amout to be in a rank u will derank)
---
2 wEeKs like the leaderboard season same end date start date etc 
---
 :-) Okay yeah i got most from overwatch but man i love that game and this game lol 
---
ples UpvoTe so rYan Daddy Can NotiCe Me
---
Do you like the map?
---
*Order delivered. Your legendary chance is increased by 1%. Also your next legendary drop gives you the following debuff: "Direct a plane to directly crash into you. This debuff can't be controlled by will."* 
---
Lol teamers showing off
---
Sounds like me 24/7
---
OMG this is a really nice art! Please make a Ghost Leon! Cause Leon can be invisible like a ghost, huh?
---
Damn you're good
---
I honestly loved the concept of Jessie little helper design or whatever its name is rather then this one. But, a new brawler is better then nothing I guess..
---
wait, having mythics drops the chances of getting legendaries?
---
Yay, thank you! Just got Gene :)
---
Supercell gave me a 15/23 brawler limit. Literally opened over 100 boxes and nothing
---
I’m at 5600 and don’t have a single epic, 1 mythic and 1 legendary &gt;.&lt;
---
Nerf crow
---
Hey ! Whats that in the sky that lan-
---
Amazing !! Can you do a Ghost Leon, cuz he can be invisible like a ghost.
---
maybe it does 896 each way, then we walkin'
---
Idk
---
Ah
---
thanks
---
Could be a new brawler or a new miner skin for genie
---
&gt; Our lawyers say 'YES! YES!'
---
yeah i hope too ahahah
---
nice concept!
---
+
---
*Another Bull map that deserves my downvote because I don´t want to see this in-game*
---
Wish i had a legendary 😭
---
Is wooosh isn't it?
---
I dont know how to attack the link but its on a picture in reddit where the new brawler had full health
---
Darryls would be able to evacuate almost everywhere
---
What is subreddit
---
You earn and lose trophies throughout battles. If you lose a battle you lose trophies, if you win a battle you get trophies, showdown depends on placement 10-5 place is a loss of trophies and 4-1 place is a gain in trophies. Ranking up with brawlers is when your gain trophies it goes to the trophy count of your current brawler and same when you lose trophies you can rank them up by getting the required trophies to rank them up. Leveling up works by getting power points from brawl boxes and when you have enough to level up a brawler you can level them up if you have enough coins. 
---
Entitled to play a solo gamemode where everyone plays solo?
---
I feel you man, it just feels nice to play showdown with bots, just to remember how fun showdown should be.
---
Remember vertical screen?

Removed. Keep your post titles descriptive and provide context. Additionally do not use low effort/all caps/clickbait titles.
---
I hope you can get your showdown star keys with ease, I'm always scared about them too.
---
Entitled to play a solo game the way YOU want everyone to play? That's exactly what you are saying....
---
Gene and Tara OP
---
Dandado, I have come to bargain
---
Just don't do it
---
At first i was dissapointed that my nita wasnt in the 400 or above range but then i saw the replay was actually available :) one of my first posts so if i do something wrong please tell me :)
---
This is actually amazing I'd love to see it in game
---
Drives me nuts that he has two guns and only one holster. Ahhhhhhhhh
---
Or this week
---
In other supercell games as well
---
How do they even feel good about themselves if they win by teaming? Where does their pride come from? They are letting other people get their trophies.
---
Why doesn’t he have ammo?
---
What trophies are you at, 50? This shows progress for players who play the game everyday, useful for top people. 
---
Its a mix all the yoyo brawler ideas
---
300 IQ Colt
---
If I had to explain someone what original content is I would show them this.
---
And say it's the opposite.
---
It's a photo that brawl stars post in his twitter, here is the link: (https://twitter.com/brawlstars/status/1100455457414569984?s=21) 
---
No no no
---
youre welcome!
---
I did not want to explain this. Mortis and dynamike are in a team. Mortis easily counters dynamike. Go on r/mortisgang and you should understand the joke better
---
Don’t all brawlers have the same run speed except star power Colt
---
Idk how people play rico. I see him a decent amount but I can't play him for shit. I am preform really well with Colt who is similar in play style but then I switch to Rico and fall apart
---
The only problem I see in this skin is that I can´t see a single hat
---
This is underrated 
---
I’ll sell my kidney for that skin
---
Maybe it's an Epic, it's not that hard. 
---
And you teamed, so no one cares.
---
No, it's a pickaxe. 
---
I think this might be a r/woooosh
---
I just typed some [random numbers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP-Ipsat90c&amp;t=720s). I do think it would be funny if a real credit card number were posted like this, but no one ever tries it since they believe it's too good to be true. The problem is that it's a joke that can't be told.
---
you forgot the space before “is”, so the link doesn’t work lol
---
Could be on trophy road
---
Green Arrow. 
---
Awk this is for casuals 
---
How you do you know its not mythic or legendary
---
Penny is a currency
---
This is beyond science 
---
Hide this post, supercell will think Crow is always this effective 
---
1k gold =1 gem
---
I like how Leon covers the whole map
---
[deleted]
---
I've calculated that his health and attack at level 1 are 4000 and 640 respectively
---
This is just speculation. 2 brawlers is highly unlikely considering how we got Gene just a few weeks ago, but it's a possibility. Also, the "minion" is wearing a mining hat which fits the theme of the pickaxe so I could be wrong.
---
Petition to name poco pocho
---
Another brawler I won’t get.. 
---
Lol alr did
---
Not really, crow has a faster range and speed than shelly no matter the powercubes. The leon should have switch to the crow
---
Ok so um... I'm 12 and if this is actually the new character I'm flip
---
It kind of is my main 😛. Was #1 dyna in the US by getting on that mad grind right after the season reset for a small while. Have it currently sitting at 615 trophies.
---
What's wrong in being an Indian god?
---
I have 21/23 and I have been playing since day 1 of soft launch ;(
---
Lord I pray to god they don’t add this
---
El Primo -&gt; The Cousin 
---
Wow the game looked different
---
Yeah that one was reaching. If they called her Rosie, then there's a strong correlation to Rosie the riveter how and how Pam looks like the strong working woman from WW2
---
Shes still at the top of the meta and i don’t think she needs a buff whatsoever 
---
u/vreddit_bot
---
I do agree that the projectile is curved in a way that it came from the brawler behind Ryan. This does let us speculate more about the attack of the "minion" (if it is a new brawler). But if it is a new brawler (the gem one not the minion) I would be surprised, I do understand where your coming from though.
---
pEw Pew peW
---
I wonder what crow is 
---
damn itd be sad if it was rare rarity and you still couldnt get it
---
How exactly do you stop the spin?
---
Is this from your old account?
---
you cant throw a boomerang while its being thrown already 
---
Damn you deleted it lmao that was quick

---
Yeah for sure!
---
Where is that vid?
---
maybe the new brawler's name will be axel🤔

Actually without reading comments I figured out it was -1
