He cant say it if someone else says it first?

I think it sorts everyone by what your filters are
---
Definitely not. Imagine if you were a match with all power level 5. Then there would be absolutely no point in power levels..
---
Thank you :) i tried balancing out the map as much as possible to create a map that suits the majority of brawlers well.

This is why if I don't play for like months.

100 power cubes, imagine that!

I remember when i went to eat school lunch with my friends i would pour a lot of salt on my food and eat it.

It's good, but not symetrical. One side or the other will get an advantage, so you can bet on players whinning.
---
Never have I wanted to breed with Piper as much as now

Nice

Its useful, if this working on opponents.But its useless on team

How did you do the hair so well?

Oh, aren‚Äôt you some Brock‚Äôs dad?

Killing 100 power cubes on Shelly is like killing a Shelly with bandaid

what is the name of this m√™me please

yup

upvoted. no hate 4 u :)
---
yes i do but i'm saying the game uses wifi to play right, so if the game disables airplane mode, you would be able to use the feature or you could have the game sync with a airplane ticket date and it enables airplane mode when you get on the flight.

hmm...

I opened him so early I just thought he was another brawler. So I have him but missed that feeling.

Because you cannot push your favorite brawler further? Really?

good luck I hope you'll get your brawlers

Primo: punches shelly

Shelly: **p a t h e t i c**

I guess it is beacuse of trophy inflation. 10k it's 20 brawlers 500+. Too easy to reach.

I haven‚Äôt been upgrading this mortis to save coins for other brawlers.

What‚Äôs your problem with auto aim? People figure it out quickly enough. Auto aim on Shelly = good. Auto aim on piper = bad. Also how in the hell is it game breaking?! It‚Äôs not aimbot. It doesn‚Äôt take into account movement or anything. It just goes for the closest thing that is a target, be it box, bear, or player.

Gem grab is soooo boring but I cannot see it being replaced

Brawl Ball is a total chaos. The continuous combat pace of this mode is not really my cup of tea
---
Why is nobody talking about Shelly? She is starting brawler
---
I posted this 5 days ago
---
Ill be honest I hate Brawl Ball as it‚Äôs so hard to play at lower ranks. Plus I feel Gem Grab has more diversity and requires more skill and allows players to learn when to be aggressive and run rather than just walking straight into that Frank to tank everything as Rosa.
---
Jeez
---
You need to try to develop some situational awareness.  Keep up with who goes where and check bushes when possible.  Energy drink is a favorite of many players for good reason
---
I Agree.

Great idea! Hope this gets lots of attention

He really don't need it,  he's almost always OP

Wait whats going on?

No 47/19 is the best
---
Both modes are pretty important (despite the fact I suck at brawl ball)
---
there can only be 4/5 game modes at a time.  more modes dilute player base and matchmaking takes longer.
---
Yup
---
u mean life leach? wish supercell bring that back too

haha lol

Nice name, you forgot "how"

No, i personally hate brawl ball

P.s crow bo and tick are next after them

Agreed highly my friend just got his first star power, luckily it was for his faviroute brawler gene (magic puffs BTW) so we played a duo match and his first thought was "why the fuck I'm I not healing"

Love Brawl Ball but my favorite will always be Gem Grab
---
I'm a agree with that, Brawl Ball is a good mod but I've a preference for Bounty.
---
yes brawl ball should be perminent
---
Feel like this is would work with bibi more than gene
---
Guys
---
reasons why old brawl stars was better:
---
1. No autoaim
---
2. No autoaim
---
3. No autoaim
---
Which star power was that
---
**IS THAT A CROW ON A NOOB ACCOUNT I SEE?**

I can't belive this is real...

Mikey's demolition
---
so you are the random i get in my matches.

I agree
---
Yep,since 2k
---
That's cold!

Damn it looks like it added a lot more than 1000 damage

showdown is already very random. adding more randomness is not a big deal

---
Why does that exist?

Nice job
---
Man i still don't have my second star power. So trust me.
---
So according to you, brawl ball is great as long as you have a lot of experience, and it should replace gem grab, the starting, tutorial game mode. Hmmmm. Something about this doesn't seem to add up.
---
Nice idea, but the aiming change is horrible. I‚Äôd replace it with autoaim being disabled.
---
thats a lie. He can also get pushed and die.
---
Ya know
---
With that much skin showing, I know there is gonna be a random guy that wants to breed with Piper again
---
Those memes already kinda died but ok

That was A M A Z I N G.

That doesn't tell much

He is pretty good by himself, &gt;!maybeeeee his 3rd star power will do something!&lt;
---
Good one dude. I add that to the other 1,000,000 unfunny El Primo jokes
---
I didn't know that and I didn't need to know that

very well said, in this case supercell would make it even by hence mirroring the map but keep my idea in mind! thanks for the feedback!

In the competitive trophy range it would probably increase the wait time from 20 minutes to 30

---
Oh sorry I saw a post about the new ones and did the first thing that came to mind
---
Oh. Good thinking.

That doenst mean that BOTH of his star powers need to be supportive.

What about when people wanted to change Siege so badly they quited the game

Faster recharge times too

And i love it

by design, Jessie's turret misses sometimes. As well as the long-range bots.

Heist is fun, my least favorite is brawl ball.
---
If you primo collected all the cubes once the teammates respawn  the teammates would drop ore cubes. At default they drop 1 then an extra 1 per 3. So if primo took 3 the team drips a total of like 6 more. A profit of 3. Imagine how far you could go optimized like that
---
Lucky you, my 7K mega box gave me squat

Just don‚Äôt show skin then there won‚Äôt be people wanting to breed with Piper, or Bibi, etc.

that actually deals damage tho

Nice but not seeing health it a bit too much. You could make it so that they can only see their health every ten or so seconds for three seconds. Or you could make it so that they only see their health when they are below 50 percent of their total health

Guys, I'm shaking. I'm fucking shaking. I never wanted to breed with anyone more than I want to with Piper. It honestly fucking hurts knowing that I'll never mate with her, make her pass her genes through me, and have her care for our perfect offspring. I'd do fucking ANYTHING for the chance to reproduce with Piper. A N Y T H I N G. And the fact that I can't is quite honestly too much to fucking bear. Why would this guy create something so perfect? To fucking tantalize us? Fucking laugh in our faces?! Honestly guys, I just, fuck, oh my fucking god
---
(sorry)

At this point Gene‚Äôs star powers are so much weaker than things like Shelly‚Äôs bandaid or Poco‚Äôs new star power and or Jessie‚Äôs new star power.
---
its a copypasta dont worry about it
---
Poco the polite boi
---
It's easy if you had 1% means that every 100 bos you should find a star power, if I open 200 box and I find nothing there something that isn't working. This happen not only to me but to a lot of player

What I'm wrong? We haven't got something new in 6 months

It's not like he stole your meme it's a template witch are very hard to find the original and also people don't credit templates just memes
---
There is no fixing Supercell could do!
---
They HAVE to use the highest trophy player‚Äôs trophies to decide the teammates and enemy team, if they didn‚Äôt do that, people would exploit the system and get easy cups by just playing with low trophy teammates.
---
So epic
---
Any other phone gang can decline the callüí™üèº
---
Generally speaking, when it comes to Siege or Gem Grab people like you are essentially the worst teammates/randoms that everyone talks about.  I've noticed this as a common denominator because the really good Solo players know how to stay alive.  In map control games, sometimes you have to make a sacrifice for the good of the team ... because you will respawn anyway.  The solo players will pull back at the worst times and its game over.  Showdown players don't typically like map control choosing to strategically withdraw to stay alive.
---
I'm in no way doubting your skill, just that your specialty usually doesn't translate well to team map control.
---
Damn spike be looking hella fine man real fly
---
Not just that... the two star powers are üí©
---
Yeah but it wasn't the same "design" i would say
---
Was Tommy in your party?
---
I find poco is better used in a strictly support roll, his normal attack healing for 500 is amazing. Follow around a bull or Rosa and attack with them whilst healing them. Makes them win most gunfights which is what he is made to do. His new star power is nice, but he‚Äôs not meant to 1V1, enemies
---
EXACTLY! THEY WILL GET THE MESSAGE THAT NOONE FUCKING LIKES SIEGE!
---
lol true, if you open 100 boxes its not a 100% chance you'll get a star power, the chance remains at 1%, but the more boxes you open you're more likely to get something at some point
---
Dude don‚Äôt make a meme template if you don‚Äôt want people to do this.  Meme templates are for using and making memes out of.  Credit for the original meme maker is an extra nice thing.  You can‚Äôt just make a meme template and then complain like this.

The spike one is so true üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Valid point. That star power works to support tanks and win over fights. But just a reminder Poco goes from a poking healer to a potentially 1v3 mini tank. His attacks are AOE and his ult goes through anything as long as it reaches. Making him a really good front line . Maybe standing behind bull.
---
I can‚Äôt tell you the amount of times I have killed two in the beginning because I am able to be aggressive with this ult. The character doesn‚Äôt need damage but by giving him it he literally zones so much without even trying.
---
So 3v3 is the 'pro'? Ok nice, I like it more
---
But after a while you should realize finding out where they are is more important.
---
I agree. I do think that my lack of skill when it comes to scoring probably gives me bias, but in general I found that I had far more success when pushing in heist than in brawl ball, since in general I've found heist to be a lot more consistent when you have a premade team, while brawl ball has such a diverse meta that even with a premade team you may still come up against teams that end up matching well against yours and drag out matches to a draw.
---
Hahaha

Like... *so you have chosen death*

God idea it is not crazy complicated so it would be a cheaper skin and brawl stars needs cheap skins

Underrated comment XD XD

The fix is that they use the lowest trophy to find the 3rd teammate and the highest trophy to find the opponents. That would stop the problem of people trying to carry their crappy friends.

Make it an event with tickets, raise the rewards a tiny bit. Add some balancing (remove the aim stuff) and I can see it happening, gotta have tickets to limit rewards and encourage gemming.

Forgot to mention add the ability to select what gamemode you want to spectate in Brawl TV.

What?

This is how it works. But it shouldn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs absolutely absurd that someone with 800+ trophies gets matched with someone with 50.
---
Dude as a F2P you‚Äôre not gonna get it if it‚Äôs even 80
---
Disable auto aim and make it visible to others that you are doing challenge mode so i can flex that my bull manual aim is just as good as auto aim

Remove auto aim

How did you do that glitch?!

Come I have draw some to look profile I have made 3 or 4

You've played for days. Unlocked every brawler and maxed them out. You've perfected your skill with each one to perfect your game, and you've finally completed the hardest achievement this game has to offer.

**HeReS oNe HuNdReD aNd FiFtY CoInS**

yeah but. how. is. this. humor. its literally one of the most overused jokes in this subreddit, just because he has *FUNNY GLOWING EYES* it doesnt make it funny
---
Leon super in OT can make for passes the opponent didnt expect to be possible in my experience
---
That‚Äôs the risk the person with 800+ trophies is taking. When you queue in with randoms, you‚Äôre the one taking the risk. It‚Äôs random, hence the name ‚ÄúRANDOMS‚Äù
---
Very nice
---
This would be a perfect crossover
---
No way... NEW SKINS CONFIRMED!
---
It‚Äôs even worse when they use their super in the bush only for them to attack in the bush
---
Ur just toxic
---
Creper
---
Not a bad map, but the energy drinks make it tuff to gain trophies consistently.

Adding attributes to skins?

I like this idea. Upvote!

Omg I love this! Its just perfect üòçüëå
---
you have 15 brawlers with the majority to rank 20?? You my friend have terrible luck. hope my upvote makes you feel better
---
Well, yeah, the Mecha skins don't need a remodel, but Default, white and Phoenix deserve it, because dude, you never see the super animation model or bugs of the skin? (
---
I would but my parent won't let me play with people I don't know cause they don't want me to talk to them. Not even supposed to have this account on reddit
---
Good job
---
use leon
---
Fantastic idea!
---
I‚Äôm at 12k missing all legendaries and Tara, been playing since global launch as well.
---
That's why it's unique
---
Phoenix Crow also doesn't need a remodel. It's a new model.
---
Im at 11k only habe spike but I want crow so badly üò≠
---
Cute!
---
I have 2 legendaries before I even got Tara
---
You shouldn‚Äôt be risking playing with a party of 2 where someone has 50 trophies. The risk when you queue with randoms should be bad team comps or someone at your trophy level who isn‚Äôt good or just a complete lack of coordination. I can handle that. But someone with 50 trophies? Come on. You can‚Äôt possibly defend this.
---
Sorry, totally forgot about that
---
Wtf? Gene is REALLY fun to play when you know how to play him...Same with tara
---
Yes I‚Äôve been lucky enough to get all the brawlers without spending a dime
---
Worth saving for it
---
only made better by rule 35: if there isn‚Äôt porn of it, there will be eventually
---
Honestly, you probably are trash and salty lol. Shelly‚Äôs super interrupts animation so this is completely normal.
---
Ok, but less fix the bugs like the idle pose Phoenix Crow, and when he uses the super
---
Nah not really. It only charges up his super a little bit thats all.
---
I am 700 poco and can confirm that screeching solo is great at getting those &lt;1000 stragglers in gem grab and bounty.  But in open maps like cell devision (I think) and jungle bounty maps. The first one provides a lot of utility. And can save the entire game against poke comps like Shelly(ish), crow, nita, spike, pam, Mortis(not poke but you can save your teammate).
---
I had 2 legendaries way before 13k I always wanted to get Tara because most of my teammates play horribly with her
---
Cursed video

It could be a 700 Shelly or a 50 Shelly you're still gonna have a bad time

Of course, i would buy

How do u know?

Agreed i'm sick of these

Mom: We gave BS at home

BS at home:

It all makes sense now!
---
The 500 healing with Da Capo can come in clutch, but it just isn't as clutch as the large coned attack for Screeching Solo that goes through walls and can act as a finisher. Plus, with the 500 healing, you have to waste ammo slots that you could be using to attack the enemies and charge your meaningful heal, your super. Yes, you can attack enemies while also healing your teammate, but it just doesn't work out a lot of times.
---
Now imagine this without the super
---
But he's a "support" brawler for a reason...
---
It even says it in the brawler menu thing so his star powers are meant to "support" (or help) his teammates
---
Everybody gangsta till the bush starts walkin
---
You‚Äôre an absolute moron if you think this is acceptable. End of conversation. Have a good day üòò
---
There is rule 34 with gene too, only one
---
The original copypasta wasn't even about Brawl Stars though lol
---
Select the brawler with the star power you want to glitch. Then change that brawler to the one you want to have the previous star power and quickly enter in the match! If the icon of the brawler hasn't changed when entering the match you did it!
---
I see you speak Minecraft enchanting table
---
Wow 3 gemsü§§
---
extremely overused jokes but I'm liking for the template originality
---
My swing was completely finished before her super even lit up yellow. Didn‚Äôt fire until the following frame.
---
But thanks, lol.
---
Thank you for understanding this. People like fix_matchmaking are just absolute idiots for not understanding how this works. Like are they 9 years old or something?..
---
Lets do this.

Do you have a link to the post or the guys username?
---
You did not look at news
---
And yes, yes I am
---
You‚Äôre gonna get arrested mate
---
He‚Äôs literally classified as a support brawler. His star powers are used to support others. Hence being called a support.
---
Yes, all of his other SP's are really underwhelming.
---
I wonder if piper has smelly feet.  Look at her feet.  They look like they've seen war.
---
just because its humour it doesnt mean its good humour. Yeah, some people will always like it, but most of the subreddit now kind of hates these jokes if you've been scrolling in it for the past few days, they are extremely overused for the people that have been here for a long while. Humor is subjective, but is it that hard to just come up with something new instead of recycling the same garbage?

Bro the game was in beta for a very long time, you should know that.
---
Guys, I'm shaking. I'm fucking shaking. I never wanted to breed
---
with anyone more than I want to with Piper. That perfect, curvy
---
body. Those bountiful breasts. The child bearing hips of a literal
---
goddess. It honestly fucking hurts knowing that I'll never mate with
---
her, pass my genes through her, and have her birth a set of perfect
---
offspring. I'd do fucking ANYTHING for the chance to get Piper
---
pregnant. ANYTHING. And the fact that can't is quite honestly
---
too much to fucking bear. Why would Supercell create something
---
so perfect? To fucking tantalize us? Fucking laugh in our faces?!
---
Honestly guys, I just fucking can't anymore. Fuck.
---
I got all of them before I even had Mortis I'm shaking rn.

I am allowed to call r/EmojiPolice as you said i can do whatever i want, so i choose to "YOU are Being toxiC as well"

---
Oh i thought u was gonna steal it
---
Flairs
---
I‚Äôd enjoy playing her too. My account is cursed.. I didn‚Äôt unlock penny until near 10k trophies. I‚Äôve kind of lost interest in the game lately knowing I must use my wallet to get any new brawlers lmao. Also I suppose the  trophy inflation update kind of pissed me off... had like two brawlers left to get rank 20 and then I woke up to the update after wasting hours and  hours of pushing
---
pregnant. A N Y T H I N G. And the fact that can't is quite honestly
---
I think the Tommy was with the Primo,
---
But gonna admit, this primo is not really genius
---
Ok

Well
---
I found the picture that you were using in that link

Anyhow, there needs to be a combo skin with Bono and Frank
---
My idiot friend keeps telling me leon is a long range
---
heist + bb -&gt; bounty
---
bounty + siege -&gt; bb
---
It s null's brawl
---
poopoo

Got our pickaxe swinging from side to side

Great Idea!!

 Or a starpoint skin

These ones are gonna be the most fun to swap

It comes from an Overwatch copypasta about the Halloween Mercy skin. The original comment was deleted/removed, but [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/57e5gh/breeding_with_witch_mercy/) was the text.
---
Lol when you see a large chinese flag on the enemy team you know it‚Äôs over
---
This is a copypasta about a overwatch skin from 2yr ago
---
  
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/5wl7vk/guys_im_shaking_im_fucking_shaking/
---
It should go in singular lines separating squishys from running and in squares like a wall
---
And we wonder why the Brawl Stars fandom want to fuck the characters.
---
I swear, Supercell look at us and piss themselves laughing.
---
5 megaboxes should be the reward for spending weeks to get here.
---
At Power 1? Yeah. It would be weird
---
That‚Äôs a bit much, why so sensitive?
---
90% of his comments are basically this but he changes the brawler name
---
Imagine no more! r/brawlstarsp

True. I always see people hating teamers and saying that they must be banned, but these people are worse, and really should be banned

I saw the copypasta on an overwatch post of 2 years ago

You're more upset about it then I was üòÇ.

Guys, im shaking

I don't know if you are allowed to colour in the Brawl Stars Logo - just resubmit it if you need to as a back up

Thousand lakes v2
---
I got 2 Star Powers too from 1 box with Spike!
---
Leon's super is still pretty effective in brawl ball imo. Just go into a bush, activate your super and take out all the squishies from behind
---
yeah, supercell was not working in vacation, how people want brawl talk now?
---
wtf ed is an italian gamer HAHA
---
No'nt
---
i have a 708 mortis wanna play
---
I just got crow at 2100, very lucky for what Ive seen ppl talk

Randy, You gotta let the liquor do the thinking

Thnks m8
---
I hate my mind.
---
Thanks I will work on it
---
Yes I'm the best brawl stars player.  No I cannot be beat.  Yes I exist.
---
This is a repost I‚Äôm fairly sure I remember seeing this before
---
What the fuck
---
Impact text
---
Its true tho
---
Needs more upvotes.
---
I was thinking about this forever. Supercell needs to implement this ASAP. There should also be an indicator to wear the smoke is gonna close in on. Great idea!!!!
---
Jesus fuck, I feel stupid right now.
---
Jessie but more OP
---
Damn why do people love brawl ball so much. I kinda hate it.
---
Excuse me wtf i dont geht your Point this isnt unbalanches
---
If you use demolition on gene the super instead of pulling the target only slaps him dealing 1000 damage
---
He will be throwing plates.. pretty cool
---
*This does put a smile on my face*
---
Right üòÇ
---
It would be fun, but maps should have to be redesigned not to focus on the center as the main battle place.
---
Carl got Darryl‚Äôs first SP, so gene can get his second
---
No anime shit pls
---
Hallo! I am a fellow brawler in brawl star! I am a brawl youtuber and i like use you funny clip for my Youtube channel! You will be has the credited in my video! I have more information down for how submit!!

Thanks, I finally got it. It took me like 30 tries tho. How hard is it for you to perform this glitch?
---
Guys has somebody tried secondo gene's starpower on Rico?
---
Poco?
---
Star Idea: Upon contact with an enemy with his hand, Gene automatically reloads all three shots.
---
With colt, it does 17k dmg
---
I did this, and it worked but I accidentally wasted 800 getting a brawler i don't use to level 8 so be careful lads
