Bro my mini account has been playing since day one of beta (June 15th 2017) and has no legendaries. So, no, your case is not normal. It has way above average pull rates.

Nice!

Ah! Gotcha. Thanks for the quick reply.
---
I don't get how this is funny to people. Posted 100's of times per week and is just some low effort karma farm. Just need some title saying the lines of "took my 69 hours" or "i'm the new leonardo". Doesn't anyone else agree with me?
---
So stupid of you you, to steal other People's art
---
Carl is also unique
---
Lol this post is amazing üçø

That‚Äôs nice &lt;:). Also thanks for respecting someone‚Äôs opinion, something that‚Äôs sort of rare nowadays unfortunately.
---
I need this!
---
Playing since just before global launch. I have exactly the same board as you, except that I also got Bibi. So I would say it's normal.
---
Lol

Don't worry l will make whole subriddit know this shit thief,you have  justice to end this man or woman

IKR!! I still can‚Äôt believe that didn‚Äôt hit!!

But you chase pro bull that want you to have super to get close to him and wait a sec for your super and life end
---
I don't like it. I love it!
---
This is actual hilarious, you stole the post from swordz and theres his name right there... your a fucking joke
---
Dank you sir

Bull: *starts choking*

(Nice art btw)
---
Dont worry man, he will be downvoted to oblivion
---
primo‚Äôs cape: am i a joke to you?
---
Todynho
---
It's normal for me
---
barley has zero mechanics bull barley and every character have one style of playing and one attack you must be an english major because you managed to stretch out something that could be said in one sentence to a couple paragraphs
---
Say it like this when a leon enters a bush with his super right after he teamed with you
---
Lordosis
---
Fuck, I want this on a T-shirt.
---
Oh so you rather everyone just let him steal others work and post as his own? Cause that solves this so well... are you stupid?
---
Definitely, its not like a typical legendary rate is 1/5 to 1/2 that of the mythic rate, no not at all.
---
Rare *and* very rare brawlers: am i a joke to you
---
Good list, but Shelly would pull out her shotgun and then scream
---
I don‚Äôt know man... 12 gems isn‚Äôt bad...

Oh! Nice fan art! Love it

Three-digit bots are fine tho, right? /s

He isn't op but his star power gives him that extra boost

oh they dont take away the fun, no.

r/subsithoughtifellfor

You just uploaded the same battle the third time

It seems you‚Äôve arrived at home

tell that to a Bibi, Gene, and Frank
---
Wow, I mean personally even a month is a little too short for promoting to vice, but obviously hindsight is 20/20 and most of the time people who seem nice for a month, aren't gonna do that sort of thing. But still, on his part, acting nice for a month just to end up kicking everyone is dedication to being scum
---
The second I see any bot over 20 when my teammates are incompetent is the second I dip or just embrace the loss, usually the latter.
---
I've got Nita at level 10 and barley at level 9, still no piper.

You should post on the BS subreddit rather than on your profile

why are you getting so angry

Sorry, and thx, lol üòé

Uh he said star player? Not star power. I think you have things mixed up

*auto-aim genes super*
---
I'm from Russia, and I can say, that [–ë–õ–≠–¢] sucks. They can't play normal, the playing only as a imbalance character  (Frank) and teaming with other Franks. They are dumb kids, who don't know how to play showdown
---
I had me a mortis feast. Easiest star player you‚Äôll ever get with him.

Bibi dummy thicc
---
When his booty is flat but so is his heart rate

Lmao we're all just copying the same words onto every thief post. This idiot deserves it though. He is just *begging* to have a bad time.

I like it, hope to see an upgrade, I think you're doing a great job ;)

Instagram always steals memes from reddit... So, its still a repost
---
Dude they are part of a gang, 1- they can‚Äôt adopt each other,  2- Crow is older than Bibi therefore it does not work, at all.
---
Nope, why would i even do something like this?
---
I was trying with mortis, annoying piper and dyna.. but my team died in the last second

This is an obvious troll. Please dont make any more posts about him

Why is her plunderbuss so small

Me: *sees Leon with super ready go into a bush*
---
Everyone who‚Äôs not Leon: starts attacking literally any empty space around them
---
if you see someone with a :V at the end of their name 99% of the time they just joined the game or hardly play games at all aka they suck
---
First, they are "clubs", not "clans"
---
Second, you can't post that here. Read the rules
---
Yeah, I am in a very similar situation, playing since global and I didn't get penny for a while. Currently I have leon, tara, pam, frank, piper, penny, carl, rico, barley, darryl, rosa, poco, eeeellll primo, bo, dynamike, jessie, bull, clot, brock.
---
crow is op, not Bibi. All crow players or people that have crow say hes now balanced but he just fks thhe game ober rn. before he was annoying and kinda good, now hes too good and too annoying.
---
El primo is the impure race that supers on to the mine when they have 10 hp left and 10 gems and the opponent team has a bibi with her super ready
---
So you agree with him
---
this i s pretty good, just next time clean up the edges on the hair and the coloring of the hair looks off
---
Did ya steal this one too?
---
No, Leon's super doesn't deal damage... I just forgot to point that out.

What if they are the same person?

Tara has to few trophies, so it is bad matchmaking. Anyway I had one time in my team all players 300+ trophies and opponents have ahd max 50 trophies. They have loosed and there was no fun for me to win against them...
---
let curves exist without yall flippin out, gosh darnit!
---
is it a barley tho ;0
---
I said it makes no sense TO ME.  Can you read that better?  Controlling still matters, that literally will never go away when the sole objective is gaining and protecting gems.   You still need to protect/control the area where the gems spawn.  Once you have enough you then have to control the area around the gem career.  Gem Grab takes less skill now.  How is dying in your spawn area, spawning with an INVINCIBLE shield, picking up the gems to get wiped out over and over again skillful????  To me that sounds like the team pinning them in there spawn and killing them over and over, are the ones being skillful.  Yet they can't capitalize on it because the invincible shield will protect the enemy long enough to defend the gems for the next teammate to spawn in.  That's not being skillful that's barely surviving.  If endzones exist, then the gem carrier couldn't die once in there spawn or else the gems go back to the middle.  That means your teammates need to prevent brawlers from getting within range of you, that is by definition area control.  When you are on the defensive side of literally anything, that means you are in control of that area.

Poor Leon lol

i have the same 1 legy ni mythic
---
My luck is for sale too! I opened 2 Mega Boxes and no Bibi when she got released and I opened 4 Big Boxes, 22 Brawl Boxes and didnt get Rosa when she got released.
---
Wait thats illegal
---
They have the night witch mortis skin though, kinda screwed up.
---
He didn't claim that it is his,he was just making a meme about him finding an anime artwork of a girl that looked like Bibi in a different sub reddit
---
I don't have his star power so idk but his reload speed is fine
---
Good shit.

Why does he look terrified

Maybe with Pam's help idk

Oh ok. Than I will try to improve myself next time :)

Wow nice kill

I think poco need more health (same as Pam)

hmmm its almost as if it was a joke.
---
Sorry sure but i gotta arrest for making bibi a loser
---
? This isn‚Äôt bad
---
Well, the left pack is a one-time pack which others who had bought it won't have it again. 
---
The right pack is event-themed and is actually good bargain compared to old event pack. ( Which include lots of coin instead of gem )
---
I absolutely hate people who steal the works of others but I'm happy to see that there are people that do their best to stop them.
---
This needs a upvote
---
That would be a very cool feature
---
Wow I really hope it's you! Yeah totally post on reddit get more appreciated than twitter post and also is easier for preventing or at least alert people about these thieves. Hope you become successful as Gedi Kor :)

Ummm, two EXACTLY SAME milk cartons with different prices can't exist. They differ. Same here dude.

How 2 do that

at least tanks' health and move speeds are enough fast and sufficient to force long ranger's attacks.

how many trophies do you have ?

Killed it with this one man, nice work, shading while keeping your hand at a distance must've been a pain
---
Biggest post-global update, but don't blame them. Most people knew Brawl Stars after its release.
---
Supercell wouldnt do such things and if they did, people wouldve found out
---
posted the wrong image sorry
---
If everyone could chat then there would be 50% more teamers
---
These aren‚Äôt the same milk carton, one clearly has more milk(a mega box). But also same size milk cartons for different prices can totally exist, what the hell are you smoking there‚Äôs like 10 different brands and types.  
---
For another store analogy it‚Äôs akin to a ‚Äúlimit 1, rest at regular price sale‚Äù. Actually a better analogy would be a packet of coupons for say Subway. One is a a foot long and a drink for $6 and there is three more coupons for a $6 sub. One really good coupon and some decent ones.  
---
The thing is I‚Äôm sitting here explaining a half dozen examples to you of why this is fine and you literally aren‚Äôt saying anything of substance. It‚Äôs like arguing with a brick wall. So I‚Äôm not sure if I can continue.
---
This is not a meme nor a template. Good thing you posted it twice so I can double downvote.
---
should have deleted the primo
---
But it does NOT make it a ripoff, you don‚Äôt have to buy this offer at all and you can see the value for each offer, so what if one is better than the other for the same price? That‚Äôs all the point in value packs.
---
How do you know this?
---
The same can happen on Eye of the Storm, which still got added to the game
---
I see you use Brawl Stats as well
---
Time to hang out with Gus fring
---
if this was real they would get shipped with mortis by the weird side of the fandom faster than you can say "why doh"
---
Poco just isnt a solo showdown character. Buffing him to make him a good choice on Solo Showdown would make him OP in other modes.
---
lol whatever
---
ikr it disapointed me a ton, was enjoying the art if you know what i mean...
---
are you using NW Mortis?
---
As I said I love his art work just not the ideas
---
Yes...
---
What are you talking about? Theres no islands in Eye of the Storm

Buddy I'm telling the truth,  this update was overrated.. without getting bibi , you can't notice any change to the game .

Don‚Äôt play solo showdown. 98% of top players don‚Äôt touch that mode because it‚Äôs toxic garbage. Low skill. Boring.
---
No, he‚Äôs one win away from 500 so he‚Äôs afraid of bad randoms making him lose like 150 trophies
---
The point is not that I died, but how they all camp untill someone has low hp
---
Eminem dawg
---
This is actually a really good idea. It would make players less worried to lose trophies on a brawler and make people want to set up a team with friends instead of spamming solo showdown. Maybe at every 100 trophies so you dont have to worry about tilting when playing.
---
I see but brawlers can still be used after they hit 500, right?
---
u/KairosTime_Gaming

Yeah but it‚Äôs easier to get at least on trophy in solo most of the time

---
I accept it tho cuz it good
---
I didnt think about that

*Upvotes anyways*
---
Matchmaking goes by trophies, not power level.
---
Good boi
---
I hope they will do it asap , not after 3 years like clash royale did
---
Yeah but MY GOD should it. 50% trophies, 50% power
---
why would want to see porn of characters from a mobile game played mostly by children anyway. also im sure that no person that is 19 years old plays this game and has god in their name.
---
Is that change my mind meme all over the world like try to change my mind or like I changed my mind about this topic?
---
Thank you, it was really fun to work on. Hopefully it turns out well.
---
Then you would probably get matched with low trophies that are new to the game
---
Well they haven't made a single limited skin in 4 months now...
---
Then you would probably get matched with high power levels.
---
Omg sorry for that :'D i she isn't a boi
---
if somebody does it i will give them silver
---

---
Please stay in school.
---
Beacouse people think you are using that guy to pretend that you took the meme format from him and that you didnt steal it
---
r/actuallyno
---
Frank say that she will have remodel in next update.
---
Exactly as my games with Bibi...
---
Yes. And in this event, all the brawlers should have a sight range (much lesser than in other events) so that they would not see each other hiding or seeking. Seeker gets lower sight range than the hider (few tiles lesser). But we should be able to see the whole normal range in the map like before. Just the brawlers should be invisible beyond particular range. Does that sound nice?
---
Brock turnin Super Saiyan!!!

Yea but they still have to fix it. They cant have one of the main ecents that broken

May I also have your opinion about hiding the player own name?
---
Wouldn't that make the HUD cleaner?
---
Have you ever looked at your name while brawling?
---
Go to r/brawlstars and tap the 3 dot on top right and chose user flair.

Except if ur Dynamike

A solid yellow bar merging into 3 smaller orange bars is much more confusing for newer players than having a separate yellow bar. But sure, I guess having that opinion makes me retarded?
---
Let's think about that
---
Every time
---
XD
---
Stealer
---
Those emojis smh
---
What do you mean, if the yellow bar is showing at all, you know you have three bars left via inference....
---
Me too, it just makes more sense. If there are 3 power cubes just sitting there, that can be the difference of our team winning or losing.

So

Now, can you do Poco AND Jessie? Together?
---
As a couple
---
But how much is that affecting gameplay? Larger character models would take up that space but no one has a problem with that.
---
A Bounty map wich I spent a lot of time on sooo please don't hate on me cause im new to this and I really want to help Supercell with some Brawl Stars maps!!!
---
I just had this with a god damn Carl. Dude was in front of me but the hit wasn‚Äôt registering. His were though.
---
No one does it,even his name is a boy name.....and he has freakin blue shorts
---
Why is your flair carl then
---
There is Beach Brock, Boom Box, Lion Dance, Hot Rod, and???
---
What it looks like when your connection drops and someone in your friends list is watching your match ü§®
---
I like they idea of this. I though of something simular to nitas bear. More DPS, Taster but less HP.
---
Can someone send me the link for this Barley template?
---
Its the opposite... Rosa is clearly older
---
So he is working for a modern Bomberman?
---
Brickkkkkk. r/brockkgang
---
Noone can change your mind

It turns red or blue already
---
No matter what anyone says , this idea is absolutely good
---
m&amp;m dogs

Congrats. Brick wants u
---
Yeah our username Is useless it would be better to hide it , there should be an option for that .
---
While this is true, I'd personally label it as a spoiler, because it is a spoiler either way.
---
Are those Pewdiepie legs in the background?

"Batt'em Up allows Bat to hit back enemy projectiles in the direction he's aiming, pierce through them, and hit them close up with his bat from left to right."
---
I have all of them except Bibi. Man I'm unlucky. Damn
---
Gene should be in the Gene tier imo
---
When you have no mythic legendary or bibi
---
Take my upvote for all those other upvotes
---
I wasnt talking about bat
---

JOU LOOOSE

I‚Äôm colorblind and I honestly appreciate the third bar. This is a great idea but it would take a little more work to tell if I have it charged
---
What
---
People assume that he won't make more Fan Art because he is currently working for a new company.
---
That's not my point. When the yellow bar moves over the smaller orange bars it appears that your shots go from 1 yellow to 2 orange, 1 big yellow to 1 orange then 1 big yellow. It makes something that was simple to an overcomplicated mess just to make it more "aesthetic."
---
I would love for the character models to take that space instead of a useless bar or text!
---
The artists spent so much time making this models and then all we see in the game are bars!
---
Jessie makes the video games
---
HoW cAn 69MiN eVeN aPpEaR?
---
Yes officer this comment right here
---
Poco vs teamers
---
Let's get this party started
---
I prefer the third bar. The orange and yellow blend too much for colorblind people.
---
Yeah, because there is a batter class
---
Yeah, you are fine
---
I think that's because his native language is portugese.
---
Yes. Me, hanjo I bring you my SIMPLE GEOMETRY! Lol jk he doesn't say that but he does say simple geometry üòÇüòÇ

This is our next goal!

 I personally think the third bar is perfectly fine, but a good idea regardless!
---
Darryl is metal + wood, should we care about ages for bots ?
---
Asking for upvotes makes me like this less, just lost and move on plz.
---
Dude dont try to lie we know that you took lower one first then pushed up to the higher one...
---
She knocks you out of her range most of the time, she has short range, and a huge attack delay, so by the time she catches up to you you've healed, and if she doesn't knock you back most brawlers can kill her quickly because she can't attack fast enough. A buff isn't needed, just more intelligent gameplay than usual.
---
Carl be like

yeah, it's bad design

I do this a lot. I havent seen anyone else do it or mention it in this subreddit but I feel good now :3

so...

In the original one the girls says red for the color

It says Brawl_Stars 414

*431

But the star power was nerfed by 33.3%
---
Oh god *slaps face*
---
To be fair I kinda want to see a showdow with all 5 barley skins together
---
Oh dang it I thought this was cool.. never mind lol
---
It's slow though, so I'd say it balances her super out
---
Wait. That's illegal
---
When you have no brawlers but spike.
---
Yeah he‚Äôs the best legendary
---
Yeah lol
---
r/iwishthiswasajoke
---
Yeah but... randoms
---
that is the joke yes
---
Lmao he not a legendary he needs a buff
---
Then why does he do it?
---
I think adding a color-blindness mode that can be toggled on and off would be better.

I wish that was true
