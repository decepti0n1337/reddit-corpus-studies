Nice work although  it Can be improved

I probably have more trophies than you lol. And plus ur the loser for playing showdown and only pushing on showdown. Ur so pathetic.
---
But shelly can't super in time because she will already be dead. Bull can fire twice before shelly can fire twice, he has faster unload speed. And if shelly uses her super first, bull will survive the super and an extra hit and kill shelly before she can fire another super.

It should have gone in. If you watch closely, after Jessie hits the ball with the super it goes downwards to the goal but it didn‚Äôt. Like there was an invisible wall pushed the ball put.

For this who don‚Äôt speak Spanish this post is suggesting a cat skin for Leon.

Why only Showdown? All modes would be nice.

Piper and Poco: Am I a joke to you?

Can we get spike but with 40 spike balls at once so it crashes the game
---
&gt;Which brawlers are best?
---
Pretty much the Gem Grab brawlers.
---
&gt;What is your favorite map?
---
None. This gamemode should change completely before being a thing I like.
---
&gt;What do you wish you knew when you first played this game mode?
---
I don't really expect anything, since I can adapt to pretty much everything new.
---
First, the gamemode drawing is a complete clickbait. I mean, the drawing shows 2 Siege robos battling agasint each other, but that never happens in actual Siege. Second, why is the reward system doubled? I know it's because the games are longer, but why the trophies? It feels so punishing to lose a Siege match than any other 3vs3 gamemode that I basically stopped playing Siege even for the Star Token (lost 200 trophies and failed, even with composed teams, so no more Siege until this trophy reward changes). Third (and last), I like the RNG involved here, but this doesn't keep it from being basically a Gem Grab match with double rewards. We should make more things to change this gamemode.

i think hes a bit underpowered...could use a buff (like crow)
---
Thanks 
---
Horrible one at that.
---
Yeah, it kinda is. But, actually I really enjoy playing bull and I aim 100% of my shots. (Unless it's an accident). Weird flex from me 
---
I think it's bc you have to follow the enemy movements when shooting, but the ricochets are much harder to land with and colt's shoots exactly straight.

If the bolts are tied at the last siege there should be an overtime round. Being down by 5% and ending the game with a tie is extremely anticlimactic :/

Crow ult was a nice touch

That's what happens with the power smoothie and 6 times as many power cubes as everyone else.
---
Clash royale was celebrating their 3rd birthday, if anything, i feel as if stuff, such as bo remodel, crow buff, etc, will come within the next few months or so. As for clash royale skins, such as executioner carl and such, i would think that the brawl stars team wouldnt push much progress on clash esc skins until clash royales 4th birthday, and so on and so forth

Try to pin the post

Piper infinite reload and massive projectile size

Dear Lord

How

ask a moderator?

i'd rather worry about the actual gameplay then aesthetics.

Hmm today I will play brawl stars   
---
No doge don't
---
also pin your subreddit rules to the front
---
Facts
---
Problem with this is that the team that makes the first push typically has center control at the start of the second round, so resetting the bolts would favor the leading team, not even it out

He literally just said /data/ directory

does it work on iPhone?
---
yep, good luck growing your subreddit
---
Thx bro
---
Bo remodel i believe is coming in the next update, and a crow buff probably will too. But still. Supercell said they wont take action against teaming. Thats what im worried about. Sure, i had a good game today where i overpowered a team in solos. But most of the time, i lose a game due to teaming, and therefore lose trophies, and then I, angered over the unrightful loss of trophies, stop playing the game for a few hours. Not only does it hurt my experience, but im also not gonna pay supercell if they wont fix this problem i, and many others have that ruins the game.
---
np
---
If he were to get a buff, I think a small health buff would go a long way. But he‚Äôs pretty much balanced everywhere else imo.
---
Mortis is a grave digger btw
---
Yep, but you need to be jailbroken 
---
I wish we could triple the HP of the robo boss and triple the damage of the IKE and increase range slightly so that the penny mortar trick would be fixed, and any brawlers who have enough HP won't be able to rush into IKE to get a few hits off, e.g. Bull rushing and shotgunning the IKE like 3 times.
---
Yup
---
Elegant makes me think of slim, maybe bodyguard frank or bouncer frank?
---
The strategy with Barley is to zone and do damage preemptively, so that when the bolt does come around, there is little competition for it. Also, typically you should be coordinating with another brawler, like Shelly or Bull, who can force enemy movement to make it easier to land your shots.
---
So he fears girls
---
Thats like saying any bird character is Crow...
---
Carl just needs a buff even maxed he cant go very far

Mippie10 (5002) trophies

I have a 'throwaway' brawler that I use for all 3v3 events when my friends aren't available. Pretty much a brawler I use to get star keys and not care about trophies. Caring about trophies when playing with randoms only ends in 2 ways:

1. Broken things.
---
2. Hypertension.

&gt; My laptop is slow as shit so I had to place every wall by myself, and it took like 15-20 sec to place it. Then when I was almost done, the site updated. It was much faster , I could place everything in a straight lain and in a square. The problem was: they also updated the textures. Sooooo my Thanos' clothes were originally old model safe heists, because they were black. Then it updated to the blue safe so it screwed all of his clothes and those powerboxes in his gauntlet were originally black spawn points that are now grey circles. So I had to put in a 2-3 hours extra to switch everything, think it out, and his face also took a few hours. That was the hardest thing I've ever done in my life: Thanos' face. And don't get me started on switching windows to the meme and then back to the browser. I probably should've used some program to change the opacity of the meme to make it easier but I ain't need no help. Well, to those who're still reading; yes.

I got even more lucky with Crow and Piper from one big box and frank from brawl box the day after
---
In order for you to watch a replay, the replay itself needs to be saved somewhere in the game server/s. I think that it's because servers can't hold every single replay from every single player.
---
I suppose they set the mark at 400 trophies because there are less brawlers above this mark, and thus less stress to the servers. If they lower it at 350, they need to expand (idk the scientific terms here) the servers to handle more traffic.
---
At least Carl's slow pick is good for changing the direction of the returning attack #buffCarl ?
---
Carefully, he is a hero

---
No joke, i am Spongebob and the day before that was it Tara
---
I think it's a glitch 
---
please adopt me
---
That was very similar to what I was thinking
---
I mean, at 180 trophies you can play every brawler in every mode and map (im currently using carl just for the star token in every mode at 100 trophies).
---
Another awsome skin but i have a good idea wht eff supercell put more ability for a brawler like speed or teleport and the abilitys you can buy it and put it in eny brawler plis puplish my idea
---
Geez spike OP

Ez

#THICC

Well I do hope you get banned for creating hacks that will diminish everyone's else experience if it spreads.
---
yo spike boutta hit dat puhs
---
But how they do the opposite with clash royale, where you can see all your replays, and has double the players brawl stars have.
---
And that's why I suggest 350 cause it's not a huge decrease in the number of trophies required.

The siege bot should have a power cube system to it so with every bolt the robot would do more damage and have more health.

But on a fair note that could make siege unfair

Wait, you're saying he isn't OP now?

LOL it‚Äôs people like you who broke this game.

Where did you get this?
---
Wait, you're saying he's OP right now?
---
Yes I agree. I'm 10k+ I have no motivation to push brawlers I don't like to play, like tara or carl. (and then gene/barley are also not fun). And I also agree with the trophy road crap, reaching 11k doesn't even give you a mega box?! But just 300 gold?!
---
They are cactuses 
---
So, we still got problem...

Lol

Is this legit?

nope~~solo all the way, bro

sometimes, and you can't die, all on you, very challenging right? lol
---
Interesting 
---
At 300 with lvl 5 brawler you will be matched with those star powers
---
Fair enough.
---
making a private server i think is against the tos
---
If they made her do the little whistle thing before the charges in clash every time she kills someone I would literally pay INF amount of dollars for this.
---
wow :0 
---
Wouldn‚Äôt this have made more sense on mortis since he dashes, and giving him a sword would make him look like an awesome knight. Still looks cool 
---
And you think it's okay
---
thank you very much! thats very encouraging ! bro
---
Yes, search 'Sakura Spike Blossom Ball' on youtube
---
I'm always watching it well. That's great. :D
---
"Matchmaking is based on the trophies of the brawler you are playing with". 
---
Not in total trophies. 
---
In this case we can say none of the two.
---
but u like it?
---
Based on Night Witch Mortis, this actually has a good shot of being implemented
---
Yes
---
Like always amazing work^^
---
I don't think getting a Legendary has too much to do with how many trophies you have. It totally depends on how many boxes you open.
---
So tactical map
---
how can u guys do this?if its on a privte server jhow to join i guess?
---
I meant that she should switch to baking because it looks delicious!

Darryl is only OP with his star power, but I agree with the rest

---
So you‚Äôre making another skin

he probably means direction

Poco yes, I disagree with frank though as you have to stop for a brief moment to attack and in that moment you are vulnerable to a Bull, Shelly Primo etc.

As a person that recently pulled Leon, I say that he's actually not as OP as people think.

I can already see the Darryl's rolling over the lake haha

i've got better map ideas than this , this was just a throwaway map 
---
He's loosing his lollipop, haha. Looks great as always!
---
It's based on trophies not level.
---
Yeah just missing spike and crow. First i got the rares and super rares. Then it went like 30 days without anything new. After that i got leon and 2 weeks after that i got piper. Then it took until 4k trophies mega box before i got mortis after that i got frank, pam, gene, carl and tara in that way. (7200 trophies now)
---
Yes I only write my sorrow because I play more than 10 month and nothing. And I opened more than a thousand boxes.
---
I'ts not bad... good job bro!
---
Why did you say 600 piper with a 500 screenshot lol. I have 600 piper if u want to lie about it I‚Äôll send u a screenshot and u can use it lmao 
---
Yeah it's really weird. Losing makes you win...
---
Hate that mode. 
---
alright well i‚Äôll set a reminder to come back to this thread when the real balance changes are released, we‚Äôll see if this is real (it‚Äôs not)
---
and you say that like I don‚Äôt want pam to get a nerf when I definitely do, she‚Äôs way too op rn lol
---
The translation is so bad that it's funny
---
Why do u guys have brawler names next to your names what the heck
---
And sorry for never gonna giving you up
---
I m gonna cry :(( :)))))
---
Idk, maybe looks a bit like the KKK robes
---
I would rather just have him banned. I don‚Äôt want to do something that could get me banned. I was cursing him in my head tho
---
It looks like the bandit from clash Royale
---
Spike with a voice seems weird for me
---
Free box isn't a trash. I got Piper from that
---
#BUON COMPLEANNO ANCHE DA PARTE MIA
---
Yeah, not a native speaker so those kind of errors are common. The countries are funny though
---
More like a Leon in front of the bar
---
He just need a nice looking skin
---
Supercell is known for not having many workers on each game, but that's all I can answer.
---
Every player in the match has significantly less trophies then that Tara and you shouldn't have to face an opponent that has a maxed brawler when your team consists of no brawlers even close to that level.
---
 In Solo Showdown this actually isn't a bad tactic and this how I got Leon to 500 what you do is wait until someone comes close enough for you to burst them provided they don't check the bush
---
Make more memes like this
---
‚ÄúShimmysham‚Äù 
---
I just learned a knee word today
---
Please show a picture of your account I'm willing to bet your mortis is  nowheres near 500
---
Let Tencent manage them.. üòÇüòÅ
---
Problem is you can win the first 2 rounds and end up losing because they manage to carry over 21 bolts into the final round and you lose. Can it be so that you take the difference in the number of nuts or something that people have? Or do something so carrying over a huge mass of bolts won‚Äôt be a decent strategy to win the game
---
Saving boxes works quite well for getting a new brawler.
---
Nah I‚Äôm saying go back to it cuz rn it‚Äôs free box every 20 days and like 2 power points and like 5 coins 
---
Of course man. If you do end up doing it can you send me a link to the video ?
---
I wish I could say that's equally as retarded but I've seen him win too many Siege matches
---
Let this spread like wildfire
---
I like them they fit quite well!
---
I‚Äôm gonna try and get Leon to rank 20 before I level him up. I‚Äôm at rank 15 but I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT EVENT I PLAY HIM WITH as higher ranks means probably more level up people meaning Leon can get two shorted by a max Brock or so
---
Today i won with a man that was playing Poco in Siege xD (i played carl)
---
We need to buff him 20000000 dps is not going anywhere 
---
Check my profile 
---
Grande! Bellissima torta
---
It was sometimes there was bulls 
---
can you do it without having Piper
---
Seriously, u got spike Pam frank in 3k trophies . U r really lucky already, my first and only legendary (crow) is at 9.8 k lol 
---
Good stuff lad
---
Thank you for saying this.  People think that if they open 100 boxes that they will get something and it just doesn't work that way.  You may open 500 boxes and not get a star power.  Then you open a big box or a mega box and you can get 2 in 1 box.  It happens when it happens.  
---
OBviousLY
---
I would have to guess it‚Äôs because they‚Äôre used to playing with ran*dumb*s so they usually would leave and do it again for the chance of a better team
---
Yeah, but i spent about 40$ andy friend is F2P
---
Why do you feel the need to complain about a system that is entirely random?
---
yes, which one do you prefer? [mmm lv1](https://youtu.be/UioqyetEnSo) 
---
Oh lol , ur frd is super lucky lol 
---
im sorry to my translation
---
If you are 8k trophies you probably played the beta. If you earned that 8k just in 4 months, you should take a breath and stop playing for a while.
---
I know how to fight shelly, but that doesnt means that shes not op. Of course i killed tons of bulls, shellys... but a brawler that can just make infinite ultimates is not balanved at all. And not every brawler is op, nita is the only one balanced, crow is ok but needs buffs. Mythics are all ok but not balanced at all. Examples? Tara is very legit against many brawlers, but destroy others (piper, crow, dyna, barley...). And dont be wrong, cause countering a character is to be able to deny or block some of its abilities, but no just to destroy it. Those i mentioned doesnt even have a chance if the tara player is good. Gene is ok cause he has a very strong attack but a non damaging ultimate. Also same as tara, he absolutely destroy some brawlers. Mortis is ok cause hes only good in some bounty maps, in a little few showdown maps and in hem grab, but also needs buffs. I could keep going but im sure you got what i mean
---
Well, there is no backstabbing without teaming, right?
---
cool Halloween costume idea
---
Well yes well no
---
450 piper level 9
---
Killed by a darryl that rolled in
---
Second time killed by a jumping primo
---
I didn‚Äôt have super either time (camping like you said)
---
Can I ask when do you plan on uploading the video?
---
Casual games would solve it. I agree. I‚Äôm at 12k trophies with 24 brawlers and I would just like to play for fun with randoms sometimes but I can‚Äôt/don‚Äôt want to...
---
Well, I was not calling them cancer on that much of a serious note. Sorry if you perceived it that way, and your points are sure correct and I understand them. But, if you don't mind, can you tell me why you consider this map stale? I mean, I thought it contained enough bush and open space, as well as some places for throwers to do work. Also, what could I balance out, in order to come to a more final and polished version? I have made only this 1 Showdown map as of now and I am not that good at making them yet.
---
Thanks for your time, and again sorry if you found it toxic.
---
dm me

r/brawlrecruit

Kk
---
A combo of Pam piper and Sakura spike! ;)
---
I am around 8k trophies and still no legendaries.And you have most poverful legendary so you are pretty lucky
---
Use Piper in brawl ball
---
HUHUHU YOUVE BEEN GNOMED
---
its not sans
---
When you know how counter el primo punch it's like this
---
Spamer
---
# I'M AS FAST AS F BOI
---
Cool map. Should be added in the game
---
# Matchmaking is like a maths equation that nobody can solve.
---
# OK NERF CROW
---
Yes we want free boxes
---
I agree with taking bolts back to your IKE is good, but  the reasoning for 4 player teams is a stupid idea.
---
You could change it to bee leon
---
Omg 500 trophies lvl  1 Leon and crow 
---
Thousand Lakes with a pinch of salt.
---
Oh lmfao you noticedüòÇ
---
You check it by being a Shelly with a Super ready. Second favourite prowl of mine after Feast or Famine's central bush.
---
BAAAAAADDDD Star power..
---
This isn't that big of a deal and is really easy to counter. It's also not a bug. 
---
New brawler is called Clusterbomber in the files. Here is a video I found on it: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=H7nUBd1l13U
---
In friendlies everyone has star power

Yea üòÇüòÇthts insane , wht mode did u grind them? I only got to rank 19 with power 1 gene haha . 
---
That is a placeholder
---

Welp, dont really have people to push with in 3v3, so solo showdown. Stormy Plains works really well for Crow and Leon

Had to dance on the grave xd. Thats me

Well i got all brawlers expect the leggies.My chance is miserable so rip i guess.
---
Poco: Stop healing
---
Darryl: DOPIT
---
Stop complaining about teams and just shoot in bushes before entering them
---
Wow! And I thought I was in a bad situation when I lost 100 of Poco's trophies.... 
---
Poco works nicely as well

Your post has been removed, make sure to use the body of a post to elaborate on the title.

I'm f2p player with +5600 since global and just lvl 85

OH! GOODNESS GRACIOUS!

who would fuck shit thats boring just fuck a person

Oh well leave with your tail between your legs and be scarred over a mobile game? 
---
You literally took what I said and tried to apply it to me because I hit close to home. How *childish*.
---
 Nice try but goodbye!!
---
Dynamike joined the chat
---
what is your total trophies? what powerlevel is your shelly?
---
I‚Äôm personally not playing poco on this map and this is amazing how far this comment has gone lol
---
Ther eis no help...im in a terible situation, If I play any brawler that is at 340 or above trophy range, I only get matched agiants bulls and shellies, and if I play any brawler that is at like 420 and above, there is just teaming...so yeah there is nothing to do by me ill just lose trophies to get a brawl box every day and when I get a new brawler (hopefully one day) then I can push a little bit...
---
Next up : Kyurem Leon
---
Same situation here.What's your leggie chance myn is 0.0288 so i won't be getting a leggie any time soon...
---
You should make the award go to the giant bush in Island Invation
---
When you try to do it will Bull's super: ¬∑_¬∑

by far the dumbest game mode. me and my friends were playing siege together and got the first two bots in the game. with their defense having less than 20% left in the 3rd round, somehow maintained mid control and got their first bot of the game, and destroyed our tower. -10 trophies for all of us and this isn't even the first time it happened. I suggest we should remove this game mode please.
---
0.056
---
A me la skin non piace
---
Nope
---
Impressive
---
I think Bo is boring.  LIke who the hell loves a bow and arrow?  Why couldn't he get a shotgun gun?  A gun that shoots shotguns that go off in the distance.  So like throwing bulls everywhere!?  
---
Now THAT is a fun game.
---
I sMeLl A rAt
---
Yeah I think it is too
---
4 year olds above me
---
Yeah I saw that
---
I feel u , I m over 10k, still matched player way less trophy than me (&lt;3k) 
---
I wouldn‚Äôt know what, because Showdown is often really rng, because of where do you spawn, who is next to you, where are the boxes, where are the people going. I think every map has there good and bad spawns. 
---
This is terrifying
---
Crow:i'm a birdmaaaaaan
---
420 token every 15 days.  
---
That's 28 token per day,  
---
Which is less than 33% of a box per day.
---
That's also 8.4 box per month  
---
**That's not much.**
---
It's a good skin I really like it, but a minor change that should be maybe changed is the sword. The bandit has a baseball bat soooo.......
---
This is beyond science!
---
I like how he is holding a mega box in his arm, good job!

Thank you üò≠üò≠üò≠

Use /s instead

thats kinda mad but im more of a casual player

White crow 2.0
---
James, listen.  This is going too far.
---
Wow thats rally good
---
4 April and 5 april
---
I know it's not that much but its a lot for me because I've been on a losing streak today
---
Done.
---
Yeah
---
To add to this, -100 trophies
---
Piper 10 power on 250, this is 666
---
*Thinochet is that you?!*
---
Don't take it personally.  Darryl just needs a big recode to nerf his damage output.  Also, I have about 14,000 trophies and so forth.
---
Tbh Carl is pretty cool
---
OK OK i want
---
Yes but played game only for an hour (Weekdays üòä)

So where is this post exactly?

---
You lost trophies?
---
You died after they stopped teaming. If you had played it less aggressively at the end you would have had a chance at winning it or at least dying one place later.
---
And you lose  i meant
