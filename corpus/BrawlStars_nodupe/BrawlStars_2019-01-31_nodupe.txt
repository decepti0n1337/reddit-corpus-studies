Don't mess with Darryl.
---
Weird flex but okay...
---
KDR has been used as a stat in many different games regardless of team goal. HALO, Modern Warfare... the list goes on and on. Brawl Stars shares the commonality with those games that they have games modes where a KDR *would* be helpful to know, so I don't think excluding it because there are game modes where it may not exclusively benefit the team would be a valid reason NOT to include it.   
---
Yeah!!
---
Love this idea 
---

Don't worry, it's just Darryl doing his thing.

I know you edited your comment. Ylu can't fool me

stop fucking pasting this everywhere.
---
And then you remember stormy plains is back
---
every time someone spins at me, I shoot in their direction (missing on purpose) and go away from that person. because if I didn‚Äôt want to team with them, someone else might
---
Oh, nice thanks for the tip. I've been using her alot in gem grab and yeah she appears to be decent. 
---
So awesome!!
---
It also helps Nerf Leon just a little bit because he does less damage at range
---
what‚Äôs in it?
---
Of course!!
---
Find 2 friends, ask them to play as Dynamike&amp;Block, get your ults charged, destory the enemy team at 9 gems, get one more gem and watch your enemy not even trying to get to back 
---
no thats where you're wrong
---
criminal scum, teaming in solo
---
You can't stop the Nita.
---
Forgot to mention team code is XE4ASGTZ
---
Food* and Drug administration (I was just joking when I said it)
---
BS
---
This is a bit odd and may sound weird but works well in my experience.  Play her in duo showdown with Frank, now this works better if you're next to, or can at least talk, to the person playing Frank.  But have both Tara and Frank charge up their supers as soon as possible, Tara can help Frank deal with longer range brawlers and Frank can clean up.  But when you're ready have Tara catch a team in her super and have Frank super right away, with his delay that should have them both and then you can kill the enemy team
---
RemindMe! 29 hours
---
I recommend only using her more in gem grab but she is very good in brawl ball too. My tara is level 18 and mainly use her in gem grab espicslly because it isn‚Äôt as fast as brawl ball. When I use her I like to do a lot of little chip damage (small damage) to have them stay back. Many times I as well hide and wait for someone like Rico, colt, poco, barley, piper, crow, mortis and maybe Nita because hitting someone with all three cards does SO MUCH DAMAGE and it is really helpful. If you hit someone with all three cards and all three attack u basically almost have your special. That‚Äôs all the tips I have for her 
---
The Shelly was try hard I managed to do it just in time
---
I think they should rework showdown. So trophies depend on your kills. So there isn't someone who has 0 kills and 1st place.
---

---
This happens a lot. If there's 3 players left and 2 kills each other at the same time.
---
Good job. 
---
How old are you? 10?
---
In a world of constant chaos how can you afford not to have at least one gun out at all times
---
Valentines Poco all the way!
---
Oh shit i don't use tara after this story 
---
Hahaha so true, it's fun for a second until the dynamikes and barley's close in
---
Plush

Spinning after killing someone is toxic unless they tried to team

---
There is another tip. I was #1 frank in the world with 850 trophies.
---
Oh wow
---
[removed]
---
You should honestly try to rank evenly.  It‚Äôs just more efficient.  You learn how to play other brawlers besides the shotgunners which take exclusively auto aim.  Plus your net trophies end up a lot higher.
---
good for u :)
---
They are sexy

unusual boast but alright
---
ok

Cool concept of he he's gonna look! I think he's gonna look similar to this as well.

Not taxes, its the exchange rate of currencies.

Too many one tile gaps

This would be cool
---
A vampire who has the least intimidating voice lmao
---
Except legendary 
---
It was 1 on top free when it came out
---
Same thing I got 
---
I called horrible because ik. Idk actually what is one tile gap
---
how did you know? I was waiting to buy it until Gene comes out
---
We are all Bull on this day.

Didn't they say it would be $5?

Not out yet

Here's the original link: https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/ahp23k/humor_well_that_explains_a_lot_of_things/?utm_source=reddit-android. Instagram steals a lot of things from this sub so yeah.

Ya
---
Yeah buying legendaries is a good thing.
---
That bear seems very confused lol. Very nice art!
---
I like to run into the fog if I'm cornered, low on health, and about to die just to deny the other player my powerups.
---
Only worth doing early to mid-game though. Not much point in a showdown.
---
Can't believe the other team followed. Well played.
---
It wasn't official, someone datamined it
---
Brock, Darryl (Star power mainly), Rico, Colt, Piper, Leon, and possibly Shelly if you are tired of facing Leon and Darryl.
---
How many trophies do you have 
---
Oh that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs $5 more 
---
Ok thanks, sorry, I knew it was stolen, just didn‚Äôt know original post
---
ew
---
It's alright
---
The updates and all the change is great imo, except the life leech one (only).
---
I wish could have told me this before. I bought 1 legendary 2 mythic 1 super rare and 2 epic straight from shop
---
If there is an offer, it will probably cost like 259 gems or something like that
---
Oh. Well I seen people with it so I was confused

I appreciate the feedback! It‚Äôs nice to hear different perspectives and viewpoints ‚ù§Ô∏è

I get lag every game, no matter where I am
---
Yeah
---
Lunar new year, the level 50 offer isn't worth it.
---
I'm not very fond of the concept. It just feels unoriginal for her to have a star power that's like Jessie's, and plus, her cannon is already annoying so this is just gonna make it more op. But I do agree that some change needs to be made to her star power since it's pretty bad.
---
This game does have hitboxes so ehh
---
Thank you! I appreciate it!
---
Awesome thanks!
---
Guess I‚Äôll dÃ∂iÃ∂eÃ∂ pay anyway
---
I can relate, I tell myself I won't spend another dime on this game, then they go and pull me back in like this.

I want to get into playing more but I find myself getting frustrated within a game or two and shutting it off. Clash of clans it is ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Just got my first 500 brawler on the map!
---
Can you post links to the others????
---
nah i made the mistake of buying two mythics in the shop
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
coulda bought so much skins
---
God, another of these posts. READ. THE. FREAKING. SUPERCELL. POST. There are two lines, and it saya they are testing the servers. It is just temporary.
---
Except he didn‚Äôt. He still top 3 overall, arguably the best 
---
Afaik 0.1- 1% for a brawler per thingy so yeah you gonna have to open at least 10 on average to get a brawler.
---
How u got that shelly tag tho
---
And he's a Vice president
---
Mortis at 19?
---
He should be at 10
---
The best I‚Äôve seen so far.
---
Gems so I can buy the plush but in the game
---
And if he gets Darryl after the offer? The offer or price will change?
---
both one favors gems other favors coins
---
barley is easier to hit and gives temporary area control
---
barley's always higher than mike on the leaderboards (maybe cause oliveoil)
---
Daayyyuumm
---
I have a butt ton of tickets I saved and I don't know what they're for, and I have 1400 left in doubler 
---
what
---
Me too, this made me sad
---
*Time to get constructive!*
---
Oh okay. Now next time I know not to buy unless it's a legendary 
---
But Poco has different particle effects; Rico just shoots a different projectile. Poco also has clouds and broken heart particles in his main attack, and his super leaves roses temporarily.
---
r/dankmemes?
---
Gems &gt; gold
---
no thanks not signing in
---
Tickets are to play special events.
---
Oh alright 
---
Don‚Äôt give up hope. This morning I got Spike after a year and a half of no legendaries!

Sure! You can find them [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/ak51oe/idea_new_brawler_concept/) and [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/akhy6s/idea_another_new_brawler_concept_chozen_the/)
---
sue this guy
---
Maybe is becuz of replay option? ü§î
---
My bad, i never saw that post, I looked on the official u/brawlstars account (which i assume you're reffering to, if this is not please tell me where you saw this)on the january update and saw nothing about the replays.
---
Do u not have an account?
---
Also assists. Some players want to know they helped the team as much as possible... Even if they didn't get a single kill.
---
Nevermind im dumb
---
350 gems, less when it‚Äôs on sale
---
Maybe for April fool's?
---
how bout 3
---
Gems since I already have Spike üòÇüòÇ
---
You could also be complete trash tho.
---
oh u caught me darn
---
a nail gun, lol damn 
---
Title.
---
what was the point of your comment 
---
I just bought the other one yesterday... those fuckers
---
It's not cheating, supercell said teaming is part of the game. They don't have plans of removing it either.
---
Guy, if this mends your heart, it isn't cheating. SUPERCELL has said it is another strategy

Iirc 350 gems. Yes, not worth it
---
Same but instead of Colt it was Leon lvl 7 ü§™
---
Well that just makes it kind of pointless to have a solo mode...
---
My guy wanted final circle but you had to do it to em
---
Yeah but Gene for sure will come out with sale like 259 gems
---
I had no idea. Also fuck Darryl, legit made me throw my phone a few times lmao.
---
Yeah I suppose so. I don't like teaming cause I feel the term solo showdown means that you're on your own. 
---
Probably server lag
---
Lunar nw year darryl
---
I disconnected during showdown, when I came back, I had a power cube and was engaging a Brock üòÇ
---
Gems can be converted into gold so gems have much more versatility when being spent.
---
There has been offers for every new brawler Leon was legendary and cost around 40$ in gems so less then that hopefully 
---
Gota save that penny
---
How do you even get Crow Leon or Spikey Ball Bitch, I have opened so many crates and nothing, best I have is 1 mythic.
---
You can-fucking-not have a main attack as a CC. It'll turn into what Overstun is now
---
70 gems &gt; 550 gold
---
Why am I not surprised you have a Nita flair. 
---
you just got bamboozled bro
---
I saved about 100+ normal crates and start opening them like crazy
---
Same here
---
I did üòÅ
---
I always laught with this pic. Both girls are almost the same
---
I've opened so many crates and only got Tara. I dont even like her. Feelsbadman
---
Great idea, but my concern is the aiming mechanics of this brawler. Summoning a bolt of lightning will be difficult.
---
You see, on reddit, there is this amazing feature called a direct message. Maybe you can use that?
---
When you say every time do you mean LITERALLY every time? As in you are completely unable to use your super? Or was it an exaggeration and it happens a lot of the time? 
---
I open every single one immediately lmao. I could not wait for that.
---
Not just Leon, A group of Leons
---
Noooo bring it back! :C I shoot these for fun all the time
---
Which one of you died first
---
This is really nice!
---
1. It‚Äôs max with friends 
---
2. It‚Äôs considered practice mode , something OBs know about but they removed it and re implemented it into friendly 
---
3. Why is it portrait???
---
Maybe assists as well
---
How do you do that?
---
Lol he was like u got it
---
I‚Äôll give you an upvote to make you feel more guilty bout failing Calc so you would work harder
---
mike-atouille
---
Feels bad man
---
What if people started with every brawler for free
---
But at a level ‚Äú0‚Äù 
---
Even lower than level 1
---
And to upgrade them at all you have to unlock them. 
---
At least then you can try them out and have fun with them.
---
Dude how you got those healing mushrooms attracted to you? The only things attracted to me are those meteor showers.
---
I just feel pissed that I haven‚Äôt even gotten a new brawler. I have terrible luck.
---
Have fear Mortis is here
---
lunar
---
Barley isn't good anymore in heist
---
They also have to put ratatouille under his hat
---
Frank's going to be scared of him
---
Clearly he was responsible for your success xD lol this happened to me in Clash Royale, and then when I lose, I reflect on my skills for 20 minutes 
---
too lazy. why do you make it like that
---
Ye yee
---
3500 trophies, no money spent, only have Tara and no legendaries.
---
This looks like somebody familiar... 
---
Thank you so much omg
---
I assume the lunar one will be around once a year, but will the other be back at random timing until I purchase it?
---
It just sucks my friend pulled leon and mortis back to back and hes spent no money and has 2700 trophies... and he already had crow
---
Brock 
---
50 gold profit. It‚Äôs not much, but it‚Äôs honest work.
---
Great transition to make a previous meme part of the next
---
Downvoted you forgot the ‚Äúcries in Mexican‚Äù
---
Lunar
---
Gems &gt; Gold
---
The odds seem so small. I just wanna go invisible and make squishes mad. :(
---
So that‚Äôs why there‚Äôs an exit button because they wanted to bring back practice mode
---
Until higher ranks especially go for gems over coins
---
Gems &gt; Coins
---
Exaggeration
---
Agreed
---
Ya happening to me. I also log back in and I die :/
---
Super is dope
---
What's up with barley super sparkling after duration is over?
---
I linked it ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 
---
I don‚Äôt understand your logic at all. How does that negate what I said?
---
Die feminist
---
Whoa.... like wow. 
---
If you look at all the names, they're so boring. The only explanation I can think of it is for easier international translation.
---
The practice. He is the most OP brawler now. 
---
Yea Ive made a v2 of the map with some fixes and changes.
---
that dudes the most toxic dude i've ever met on brawlstars
---
Lol
---
i think all packs are worth it, but yea for non spender its pretty good 
---
The lower your rank the more trophies you gain per win and the less u lose per loss. U said dont use em after 300 and i said yeah i wasnt for that reason
---
is this not common knowledge?
---
 why repost someone else's good meme 
---
its awesome 
---
iPhone 7 
---
Hear you loud and clear, about 40 people commented the exact same thing before you.  A couple useful comments mentioned letting the stun proc after 2 or 3 successful hits.
---
\+dmg done,healed and tanked?!
---
Gems. You can get gold pretty easily if you play a lot.
---
hmm use your best judgement
---
The heal circle description says it avoids grouped up players you can check now while it‚Äôs still up 
---
Dynamike doesn‚Äôt always deal 1300 damage
---
Each stick does half that and they only deal max damage if you are between them when they explode, the splash damage overlaps.
---
People think he‚Äôs op until they unlock and play him, they begin to realize how weak he is.
---
Slow reload, hard to hit projectile, no control, can‚Äôt reliably kill people on top of you, all of these downsides for only average damage output.
---
Barley can at least kill people on top of him, even if it is a bit harder with his super nerf.
---
\*smiles\* First time?
---
Hi
---
"samsung devices" is a pretty general term, might elaborate on what phone you hVe

I am posting this again because I had a couple tweaks I wanted to make. This is the final reiteration, hope you like it ‚ù§Ô∏è

Smash and grab. That was gem grab's old name

One has more gold

I only teamed with pre-buff Mortis but that's all.
---
The lunar new year offer was 10 bucks
---
Yeah, gem are better
---
70 gems for me, i already have 24k gold
---
But the other has more gems and if you put those gems to gold the gold will be more
---
Going back to old bb, no ammo for shooting ball and spawn players where earlier used to. I mean the bb before the 3D update here
---
Reverse!
---
Good concept, just please no more furries!
---
i got crow at 1500 and
---
leon at his last offer
---
Whoever plays Poco in Solo Showdown deserves it. 
---
Both double value nah but for real lunar
---
Man this was how the game used to introduce their brawlers at the beginning of the soft lunch 
---
I don't draw furries? Lol....  Isn't he just a human wearing a wolf hat?
---
Good job must have been hard
---
I felt that
---
50 gems buys 500 gold in the shop
---
Bring back skulls for Mortis and nerf to 1000 or 1200 hp, leave frank the same way.
---
Changing both of them was unnecessary.
---
Yellow vest penny 
---
4481 trophies 303 on crow my odds are .o768 and i  have spent 0$
---
Girl‚Äôs*
---
It's turned out it is actually $10. I was gonna buy that too

My friend is at 1.7 k trophies with leon and spike

But that‚Äôs JUST A THEORY, a GAME THEORY. THANKS FOR WATCHING.

#removethelimit /s

You better get the eye bleach
---
Its 1000% not worth it i bought a mythic brawler deal its not worth it.
---
1. Use your gems on tickets and token doublers
---
2. Not as fun and pulling RNG
---
5v5 tho
---
I would have it take no ammo to shoot the ball and just have a whole set of new map that favor offense rather than defense.

---
Playing since 1.5 yrs and only 1 legendary 
---
It‚Äôs tough for the brawlers at 10-20, they are all around the same for how good they are. Who would you put lower than crow and piper?
---
a lot of people know this he‚Äôs probably flexing his account i agree
---
Eh, even with the buff I don‚Äôt see him being too good in any game mode. Especially with the hard brawl ball nerf
---
Here‚Äôs a little lesson in trickery
---
You know why. 
---
names are not unique there‚Äôs probably hundreds of fake molts 
---
Okay cool, then my comment is ‚ÄúI know right!? Makes me want to play the game with a controller or on keyboard and mouse.‚Äù
---
im an ignoramus, tbh i didnt look at his stuff anyways
---
lunar, 50 gems can buy 400 gold 
---
Dont scare me
---
Bro imagine seeing this pop out of a bush with a super.
---
I'm not lying bruh. Might be unluckiest person everüò≠
---
You might need to change the health, attack and reload speed, and range to incorporate this, but perhaps after he hits an attack, it ‚Äúcharges‚Äù the enemy and doing consecutive hits within a certain time frame will do extra damage (could allow to stack up to two charges so it doesn‚Äôt keep adding extra damage if you manage to stay on them and they haven‚Äôt died after the third hit)
---
lol is this faxx
---
buying boxes is one of the worst ways to unlock brawlers. free 100 token boxes have the same legendary chance so buy tickets for robo rumble and play with a god team
---
I mean I can't see what's being done. All i see is a Nita moving some trash where it belongs, in the dump.
---
Update: got them both and got trash lul
---
Well, i don't know you but every match of gem grab and bounty that i have played with mortis i always won.
---
We should only see OURSELVES stats cuz it creates feeling of "inferiority" or something 
---
Not all brawlers are created equal
---
What makes me want to play with controller is going down the left side of a map and not being able to see under my thumb, I‚Äôve walked into so many bulls and Shelly‚Äôs looking like an idiot. Or anywhere if a piper is under my thumb and I don‚Äôt see her lol
---
Damn!! Have more fear Mortis is here
---
genius sub
---
Why?
---
Dang. Was hoping it would be 5$ like Christmas 
---
You better bullieve it
---
He seems more flexible and ruthless than the previous Darryl movements
---
i feel like crow might have the edge over rico and mortis
---
piper and crow are easier to push than frank or mortis
---
penny is not better than either in my opinon
---
both of them over poco too poco is underwhelming
---
I understand all that - you‚Äôre wording was just awkward. 
---
buy ne some gems üòÇüëå
---
Bull central*
---
If I bought the LV25 Pack, can I still find the lower LV Pack in shop?(I haven‚Äôt bought any of it)
---
Tragic... well maybe we could squad up sometime. Only been playing since global but, im 6100 got everyone rank 15 today (me holding back tear still dont have legendary) so thats nice
---
Poco, he‚Äôs right behind you! Oh god oh frick. He can‚Äôt hear us! He‚Äôs got airpods in!
---
So will the pack be gone by the time gene comes out seems like it to me
---
You might wanna get a fact check. They said that before hand. And in response they made event modifiers. And besides, the event modifiers were made to prevent teaming, you can‚Äôt argue with that.
---
Got the level 50 pack too but not gonna buy it, especially since the lunar pack is better. I didn‚Äôt play back on Christmas otherwise I would of bought that one :( 
---
I will üòÇ
---
Aww. BEAR!
---
Thanks for this good art. 
---
Place another one. No pint in detonating it and not having a cannon anymore. Just charge again and then you get another one and some damage done 
---
Maybe the 3 skins that aren‚Äôt lunar new year won‚Äôt be limited edition 
---
The best teaming there is! üòÇ
---
thiccochet is indeed wonderful in showdown
---
really

Good luck with that.

Gems

That is quite expansive I would gladly throw 5$ but 10 no thanks.

Teeeeaaaammm wooorkkkk FTW
---
I think the Rico and mortis buff helped a good amount and are both better brawlers than crow and piper rn, before the balance update I‚Äôd agree with you. But it‚Äôs just my opinion, I can see where you are coming from
---
just use frank and then ez
---
I love it personally! I don‚Äôt think we need another thrower, and the SP looks op, but it very unique 
---
\[To elaborate\]  A factor to how much experience you earn per match depends on how well you did in terms of eliminations.
---
Mortis is a good brawler, but I feel there are better options than him, and he can‚Äôt do anything at all in heist
---
when you get hit by franks super
---
of course they wont be
---
Jeez that was actually more realistic looking than I thought. Props to you, but I don‚Äôt know if I could pull that off.
---
Great concept! I really like it
---
It‚Äôs old 
---
Diner-Mike.
---
Weird
---
Yes really
---
Bug but can be OP
---
People will get so triggered in the last 15 seconds if you do this. Lol
---
I actually made a post about sans poco
---
Did he start with and empty super? Will three hits full charge it?
---
I‚Äôm gonna stop you right there
---
This is what I fear
---
Ugh this now means every "special" sale will contain gold instead of more gems, gg SC
---
Yeah it‚Äôs true, but it‚Äôs not done
---
Disadvantage of this strategy is that it would probably only work against good players though lol
---
*slap the money... BOTH
---
Wtf are you even trying to do at this point my guy
---
70 gems

Gems.

I like how it rewards you for consecutive hits. That could work.
---
Before I read your comment I thought of another idea, so figured might as well shoot it your way.  I was just thinking about an effect that would stylistically make sense with lightning, and I thought of that saying, "lightning doesn't strike twice in the same place."  So what if we could keep the stun, but where ever you hit leaves a blast radius that can't be struck again for a period of time.  It could either be a literal amount of time, or something like after every 3 hits, the oldest marker goes away, and you can hit the zone again.  So you're potentially creating safe zones, punishing you from missing, but at the same time if you do hit a target, you can't just stun lock a character over and over in the same place. I imagine your opponents trying to strategically making use of your safe zones.  Idk, just thought.
---
Mbnnn
---
The christmas pack was only 4x value so not much better but they're both good, I could really use the gold that's why I want both
---
Wow, that‚Äôs sounds very cool. I would love to see that in the game!
---
Chuck Norris yeti to my eyes
---
What time zone are you in and how did you get that not in my shop
---
Litteraly everyone is lvl 50 here lol
---
The new brawl ball is honestly a lot better than the old one since you can't kick the ball behind the goal
---
The only complaints i really have is that ammo kicking cripples mortis, the spawning in goal isn't that bad but maybe make the goal deeper
---
Im in EST it‚Äôs currently 10:15 pm here 
---
Mortis mains: _what the FU*K_
---
Please delete all these guys like omg I play Leon who is 100% balanced. If your dieing to a bull/colt with Leon you should just delete this post. 
---
Wait a minute. What?!
---
Why not both?
---
wasnt this taken from another meme
---
I see it too, I think he needs to be a little smaller. 
---
Is the new Rico meant to be a homage to Bender from Futurama?
---
But they went in with him 
---
42
---
The m fking plush
---
Godamn I love when you artists do it in your own style instead of trying to copy the actual game's style. So good.
---
Those brawlers you listed do more damage up close so if you made maps smaller they would be better, and colt takes skill to aim so
---
Yeah that's my bad dude, im exhausted. And at the time i commmented that I was high lol
---
You are a heroe!
---
I would want this on Bounty only. It could adversely effect playing the objective on heist and gem grab where k/d doesn‚Äôt necessarily matter as much 
---
He doesn‚Äôt need to be fixed. He‚Äôs still descent kind of like Darrel now. He was WAAAY to OP before the update. There was no way to stop him. So I guess you‚Äôll never get to play him. üòÇ
---
Wait isn't this from like 8 months ago or did they re-add this map?
---
it still clearly looked like they had the advantage when they ran into the gas which is the "first half"
---
the second half is when dyna respawns and kills both members
---
Too much
---
I am at 10k cups and had never spent a penny on the game until the Leon update came out.  Before I spent money I had every brawler with every star power except mortis( I have him on my second account) after I spent money I got Leon and got him max level.
---
r/thechurchofshaggy
---
Where are people making these new map ideas?
---
Thicco Mode or Mo Bamba
---
Legendary Chance: %0.0576
---
Boxes opened a day: 5
---
Legendary Brawlers: 0
---
Mortis the Vampire King
---
That‚Äôs not a friendly game that‚Äôs a bot game
---
That‚Äôs a rip in the chat boys
---
Frank üëÄ
---
Justifiable if it was a Leon
---
As an 8k
---
I don't think it's possible to fix it nor do I think it should be. Although the only way I could see discouraging the behavior is to allow people to report players for teaming but as SC has stated, teaming it's part of the game if you choose so. And frankly reporting players for playing the game in a manner you don't agree with is ridiculous. However actively sabotaging in a team match should be a reportable offense especially since trophies are on the line. Personally I'd rather they fix matchmaking for team modes before they do anything to solo showdown. Just my 2 cents. 
---
You‚Äôre only allowed 200....
---
u/Binnyboy
---
Thats a big going around, basically if he breaks a skull next to a wall in that map, his attack destroys everything it touches, only seen it work when he goes up at an angle though
---
Nice! I‚Äôm happy to see that you don‚Äôt need the character maxed in power level to hit rank 20.
---
Are you Canadian? 
---
GOOD JOB BIG ACHIEVEMENT
---
Can we get a 30 gem skin lol
---
Well Leon's not that great anymore but still feels bad
---
I haven't had to many issues with that either. A few when I was still under 400 total trophies but not after that. I feel like a report function would end up being bad from what I've seen here in this sub. Sure it would help the community police it self but... there's too many "I play with a code of honor" types. Meanwhile I'd bet money that if they're on the team, they're more than willing to help.
---
That was to avoid 1 tile gaps. Your main attack would do that too. 
---
Youtube has the perfect answer for you, i have looked up already!!
---
Ah
---
they re-add the legendary map 
---
Yes
---
What the heck you literally lasered her
---
Yeah it‚Äôs a somewhat buggy thing that happens because of the bones
---
The prices were already spoiled
---
This looks a lot better then before and it doesn't feel like you added 2 maps together now,also if you didn't tag supercell you should and try to get put in the game!üëçüôÇ
---
He betrayed too early there's a way to backstab too
---
It works anywhere where a bone is next to a wall
---
Op means overpowered, fucking normies
---
So is the price for loaded Rico, and yet we got different price. Your point?
---
Maybe you should also ask why primo says his own name
---
It works with primoüòÇ
---
Are they ever going to do something about teamers jesus
---
Is this...winning?
---
I lost almost 100 trophies on my samsung because of this. You are not alone
---
That‚Äôs a real tongue twister
---
I swear many leons think they‚Äôre unstoppable and play way to aggressively lol
---
Same lol, the crashing is so annoying. Lost some trophies because of it
---
"Eheheheeheeeeeheheehheheh......ehehehehhee" ~ *sans*
---
I read this in Bull's voice, _no Bullsh*t_... I have no regrets
---
Yeah this game makes me want to never play a game with loot boxes again lmao
---
Well what I said was pretty self explanatory.. Their are people that are below 1k trophies that have spike and crow bot or not. The ranks of the bots vary as well. Do you really think supercell would make it clear to see that they‚Äôre bots as well? Just because he has 1k trophies with level 7 crow it doesn‚Äôt prove 100% that he is or isn‚Äôt a bot. However if he has brock and has never reached 1k trophies on a new account then that is a bot 100%
---
Brawler trophies nothing else
---
Wait a second.... *that's illegal*
---
A pride of Leons.
---
L E T ' S  R O C K
---
What is this rico heaven
---
They said it is when the lunar new year offer ends
---
Ooo maybe Darryl could have a Birthday cake skinüòÇ
---
Trade gold for gems :)
---
And that's why Tara's Super is OP!
---
Plush 
---
Relatable 
---
Yeah, even currently, I'm always taking unnecessary risks just to be the star player and it's not helping the team win
---
He was recently nerfed so I guess the confidence is running low haha
---
Chill 
---
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zed.mapeditorbrawlstars
---
And op is no where to be seen, not surprised 
---
Easy choice. Just don‚Äôt team in solo showdown lol
---
Oh god üòÇ
---
Imagine teaming with a Shelly who has their super and only knows how to use auto-aim 
---
Does anyone else think we need just 1 more healer in the game?
---
u/thiccochet
---
I‚Äôm 9k with no legendaries 
---
Don‚Äôt put the spawn in the goal...
---
thats GREAT. 
---
hey, would you mind explaining the season ending in 11 days thing? im new to the game and i dont get how it says "diminishes trophies earned above 500 by 50%" 
---
This happens 1 out of every 3 to 4 games while I am pushing brawlers to 500 so.... no.....
---
I‚Äôm at 1800 trophies and I don‚Äôt even have all the super rated and the only brawler I have above that is Tara
---
Precisely, it is a bit of a throwback to the old narrower maps where rico was Leon.
---
Please delete the game so nobody will have you as a teammate ever again. 
---
Shotgunners work? How?
---
Darryl works but he's not exactly a shotgunner (more of an assassin)
---
They need 1 map for every game mode where every brawler is viable
---
Why‚Äôs they say it‚Äôs $5 though
---
Teaming is not cheating, SC has said it
---
Oh come on... Why you gotta hate on my Shelly skills? üòÇüòÇüôÖ
---
^now that's a real statement^
---
Chill
---
What?
---
Idk maybe i just use pixellab to edit it if it dose look the same as another meme im sorry i didint know
---
Yes! So excited to see more of them!
---
There isn't much of a difference either way
---
Ha ha
---
But you would have to push to 500 first to upgrade that brawler. I mean its an idea that i wnated to share. 
---
Yeah i know üòîüòî
---
Supercell wants to know your location
---
Remember time when game actually required skill?
---
wait were u sarcastic abt the ur original comment?
---
*F*
---
U should do it slower
---
What about who already maxed it?
---
Yeah thats a cool idea too!
---
Thanks
---
who‚Äôs the friend then
---
We?!?!
---
It can be implemented for the new upcoming brawlers. And those who have not unlocked certain brawlers as well
---
God i miss these days. So many good things in this pic that have been changed
---
1.1k???? Wow thank you guys i never thought it would reach this many upvotes xD
---
love the pam
---
That's insane 
---
What was the trophies count for that match?
---
Now i saw thta u have ron curency so ur romanian
---
Life leech game mode was the only one that could stop the teams.
---
I had an original idea.. 
---
we all did &lt;3
---
#BRINGER OF BATS
---
Intentional.
---
It only happens if you play with a friend.
---
well minus the noobs who downloaded the game with global launch and don‚Äôt have all brawlers anywhere near 500 and still have plenty to do 
---
Nah in boxing el primo is better
---
That's a difference of 70 gems tf
---
I'm confused. Teammates are already revived in every game mode where there are teammates. Also, his super would be impractical in solo showdown. 
---
nothing you can do. maybe see if google play games works if you're on android 
---
Gotta pay to win G e M s
---
Any proof? That‚Äôs a pretty bold claim when the REAL top players have over a thousand trophy‚Äôs 
---
Not bad for old timer
---
Nita with 10 power cubes after 6 shots.
---
cuz bs now required so much ram to running a simple map which is bullshit.. i miss those moment before the global when bs was buttery smooth.. now we just have to delete this game once and for all
---
Turns out I'm bull with 20 power-ups
---
Had this happen to me playing as the Bringer of Bats.
---
02:58 rn.. Yeah, I should go sleep..
---
Lol I watched you guys betray each other one by one
---
Enjoy, my new friend.
---
Lollll
---
Ehhh we‚Äôve seen better offers
---
Yeah thats my point you didnt loose  much
---
yep
---
The lunar pack is 9.99$
---
Matchmaking forgot to check the bush.
---
It's gene other than the passive category
---
spin2win
---
Okay sure.
---
I‚Äôve marked down every single time where I‚Äôve gotten a mythic, epic, or legendary brawler. Only these decrease your chances. 
---
So I split up the timeline into sections based off of mythic, epic, and legendary brawler times.
---
This is then put into a program which will use a for loop to simulate openings and will increment the probability by 0.0048 every 39 boxes, just as brawl stars does. 
---
And that‚Äôs how I got my probability 
---
Lol this is so smart! 1000 iq
---
Smh I don't support teaming but I almost always team and betray in solo sd
---
i choose or
---
dont know bout you guys but my chances increase after one a week's worth of boxes by 0.0048% its not bad
---
Caught me at work again Mr Crow
---
Hunger games?
---
Ironic you used all three bots on your team example
---
Okay so you are saying its Supercells fault you dont have either Leon os Spike? "Kids", lol. Know your facts before you talk.
---
But it is probability, it is not fact. At the end of the day it is still rng, if you flip a coin 50 times it should drop on tails once in a while, does not mean it certainly will. 
---
Me too
---
DOES ANYONE WATCH THE BRAWL TALK??? im sick of people asking this question over and over again, and even if you didnt watch the brawl talk THERES THOUSANDS OF POSTS ASKING THE SAME QUESTION SO WHY DONT YOU CHECK THOSE INSTEAD
---
That Shelly has worse reflexes than my granny
---
I know it‚Äôs not fact but players should not have to wait for a new brawler to continue progressing in the game 
---
Looks great Tam, keep it up
---
They don't, you are free to progress with the other 20 characters. 
---
Ugh so hard to decide!!! Lunch or no lunch.üòÖ
---
Thanks Sart!!
---
I‚Äôm complaining that I have to wait before progressing further into the game 
---
or if ur lazy, he started with 3/5 of his super charged. swiped twice to fill it up, swiped 1 more cause whynot, then supered.
---
I maxed them out already
---
Yeah powerpoints wise, now get them all to 500 trophies. The powerpoints are not the endgame here. 
---
How long is the stun? That sounds very op
---
Just look at Overwatch .. i want as much Stats as possible .. And I‚Äòd love to have a Stats Section where I can see my most kills in a game.. most gems etc. 
---
Good point 
---
Mad
---
GoT ‚ÄòeEm
---
As soon as I thought about it, I could not do it!
---
You know that the chance to pull a mythic out of a mega it's equal to the chance of big and regular right? So just save 2 regular boxes and you'll have the same odds of 2 mega. The only reason for me to save them (but I've already bought it lol) is to power him up as soon as I get him. 
---
TLDR:
---
Btw since I maxed out almost all brawlers (at the mid of feb. I will be maxed out, I'll max him very fast). At the end I suggest everybody to buy his offer (at max. it will be 350 gems like every other mythic which is better than 0.2496%) which is lesser than my legendary chance lol
---
Dam son 
---
Thanks!
---
Please no I'd be bottom with 0/13
---
Leon is already struggling with his new nerf.
---
I miss these days like I still miss him today.
---
you just outlined it 
---
Its purposely done so.
---
So that no one will have an advantage from their device
---
This is the first time I would spend money on a video game. Do you guys think it‚Äôs worth it or should I wait for a better deal? Thanks
---
They said that it would be in the middle of February.
---
gl getting literally anything else in this game, but thats a godly pull bro
---
If your teammate lives and you respawn you continue as your previous brawler. If both are dead, you both respawn immedietaly but both restart. Once one of you get a kill as leon your team wins
---
The LNY one is alright. If you have that cash it's quite good value. But the one for 39 gems is pretty bad. 
---
I mean you need 400+ on a brawler to record a match so...
---
Pretty high level if you ask me.
---
I put the image, drew him next to the image, made the image a little transparent, put the image on the drawing and corrected the mistakes. He was looking awful before doing the last step
---
Then the Mythic brawler offer comes out just as the lunar new year offer expires.  
---
I do hope that Supercell releases Gene before the offer expires.  They can even put up the Gene offer and I'd buy it and the lunar new year offer just to level him up at the onset 
---
Aight thanks! Do you think better deals will come as I progress in trophies?
---
Big Game is fun, but the rewards aren't. They really need to rework it and not just change the maps.
---
Oh, really?  but is very uncomfortable :( but you are right i think.
---
Lol...max Darryl under 200 trophies.
---
What about the new event robo wars? Will it be in this update. 
---
The update so fa is amazing. GG
---
Holly crap that's one condensed talent you got. Awesome
---
Ikr P2W 
---
i hope darryl won
---
 i want the darryl skin but i don't have darryl yet ;_;
---
Buy both!!! Lol 
---
Why can't people understand this? People team in showdown not because they want to play with teams, but because it **helps them get to a higher position**. Adding another mode so that "people who want to team can go play that instead" is exactly why many people don't understand showdown.
---
I was pretty close
---
Why did you include a picture of a deal that literally has 3x value? Smh...
---
I have 2800 trophies, still missing some
---
I'm getting serious lag since? 
---
Everyone they should put a discount like te christmas skins
---
wait in a bush (preferably one in the center), spam auto aim
---
Cups?
---
not really, the RNG healing mushroom god was on my side. i had a connection error at 1.12 and they kept me alive
---
Colt has sparkles on his attacks just like brock
---
Starting to get all brawlers to 500 now. I'm at 8700
---
No discount on skins?
---
I am grateful. The price of Brock is fine, same with Darryl. But Colt‚Äôs skin needs to be 80 gems, not 150!
---
SBLOCCATO!
---
Make discount on skins or I won‚Äôt buy #discounts
---
Man the old lv 35 pack was great.. sad to have missed them
---
That is a name... There are no rules against teaming...
---
And what do you mean - What is my main?
---
well... it is a little more expensive now
---
Yes because the skins not worth that much 
---
Maybe you would like to join the feeder band, SAVE MORTIS 2

It has more gems
---
Ok maybe ill join
---
Abush :))))))
---
 There are **549,004** people in the U.S. with the first name Ryan 
---
does it work on a fire tablet with the new update?
---
*That's gotta hurt!*
---
Really depends on what you want out of your first max brawler, personally I'm trying to get Shelly or Jessie first, I'd like to get Darryl first but I want to push him to 500 at lvl 1
---
Its the name of the gamemode, thats what the gamemode is. For example, if I go to gem grab, I expect it to be a gamemode about grabbing gems. If I go to SOLO showdown, I expect to play against other people, *SOLO*, if I wanted to play with a partner, I'd go to DUO showdown, ya dingus. 
---
I mean what is your main as in what character do you use more (as you can see from my user flair, I main Nita).
---
Yeah, actually. It's just another BM attempt at the end of the day. Besides, I never do it if I have low health. Got to look after my own trophies.
---
The smallest effect on Darryl Dumpling skin...
---
Why are people playing tanks on this map ?
---
Yeah Nita is a great brawler of course, I‚Äôm not criticizing the brawler 
---
Perhaps, I play every brawler so I don‚Äôt pay attention to the trophies range
---
Yup, El Primo can also but he never does that
---
Mr. Hands for Brawl Stars!
---
Go the main Brawl Stars Reddit and go to _Assign User Flair._ There's a tag for every brawler except Gene.
---
AHHH THE PTSD!!!
---
Underrated AF
---
Yeah or primo is too passive or he is way too agro, a primo player in a nutshell
---
Probably not. If you like them, best to purchase while you can. 2 weeks of being available for purchase is more than enough to understand if you really need 'em.
---
You have Piper.  Your Statement with no epics is wrong. 
---
Wc mahn
---
vice president thiccochet
---
In the next few seconds, that Colt is going to turn around and last his Super directly at him.
---
I counted Gene
---
They sell these skins at a fortnite/desktop price point. I thinks it's too high for a mobile game.
---
With 80 trophies it isn't
---
No point in stacking unless you're trying to get gene when he's out
---
sin dolor no hay Gloria.
---
Woah thanks man
---
* *YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE A LOCO TIME*
---
It varies on the situation. Trust me, I like using Nita but there are those annoying moments when a Bull can mop the floor with you. The best way to escape Bull is just keep moving and if he tries to get close, move away from him. 
---
No problem.

Hah, many times I ‚Äúsuffer‚Äù from ‚Äúteamers‚Äù but I team too, so i can‚Äôt say much against it, though if they solve the problem would be great.
---
The question is; why would you go near a shelly even if she doesn't had her super she can easily kill you
---
Make them available to everyone
---
Is the Lunar worth? I am a new player 
---
Yeah supercell kinda overlooked this
---
Too manyüò•
---
I thought it was 5$ as well :( wasn't there a reddit post by a leaker that said it was five dollars?  
---
That¬¥s a great idea, i never thought about it
---
Why are you crying? He‚Äôs not taking credit for it...
---
 I want a t pose spike
---
Apparently Rico gets a rework too /s
---
Its a replayüëç
---
the offers are reallly bad are we already going on the clash royale path ? oh my god btw I feel like gENE WON'T BE PURCHASABLE  I'm 100% sure at this point that we'll have to find him into chests , if this happen I'll drop the game 
---
In the French version he is called DynaMike
---
I thought yedi is brown 
---
What offers! My game crashes very often and it's very frustrating. First terminate this bug :|
---
It is $14.99 AUD so I believe it is $9.99 USD
---
Oh, I see :). Don't think I was rude, I don't have any at 500, so I thought nicknames become visible üòä
---
What were you doing? If I‚Äôm not mistaken you were using auto aim.
---
Brock have 3-4 skins and PAM,Tara,Poco,BO,Piper doesn't have skins üò°üò°
---
Wait a second,  football bull in the next 20 hour? 
---

---
They will end up losing money if so. The most logical thing to do is not to get rid of them....

Bo needs a new look

Go back to fortnite. We don‚Äôt need stuff from fortnite in bs

LOL
---
phoenix crow is a phoenix, not a dragon

Bonny is a close friend do mine! He sent me a text 3 months ago asking if I like the map. The irony is real.
---
He doesn‚Äôt have a club lmao
---
Don't tell the people of our secrets!
---
Bruh he‚Äôs experience level 198 he‚Äôs the best of the best
---
This aint my first rodeo
---
They added 2 more skin slots and filled one of them, just like 3 skin slots of piper
---
Colt skin is trash and they expect me to pay 10‚Ç¨ for that. No way in hell
---
Yeah sometimes the movements become glitchy and laggy. Lost many trophies beacuse of this. Also the game crashes after playing a few times.
---
[deleted]
---
I got it
---
r/okbuddyretard ?
---
This the best skin in the event because 1: it has a different attack animation (soy sauce and mini dumplings) and 2: it is the cheapest skin for 80 gems
---
Not to flex but I just passed 3k and the only brawlers I'm missing are Pam, Tara and the legendaries
---
Same and My joystick is getting stuck and i keep moving
---
 no idea how to stop
---
Happened to me 3-5 times
---
Yeah everyone is experiencing this and it also seems to be every 3rd game, first I thought it was coincidental but it‚Äôs happened every 3rd game now. Maybe every 3rd game you play instead of playing close the app and reopen it and see what happens, if it works then do that every 3rd game. 
---
If he put the name of the person that created on it he is not stealing credit man. He just like something other person did and repost
---
Nah, if they're limited, you feel more pressured to buy them. 
---
I never heard of such creatures
---
That‚Äôs why Mortis is one of the best anti teaming brawlers in the game
---
Fuck no. I have no money to give them atm but if the pack were to come out again next month. CaCHING!
---
It's your choice to buy it, whining on Reddit does nothing to change it. Stop blaming them for being a company that needs to pay the bills and salaries of its employees, these are limited time skins and they cost more because of that.  And yes, while they are expensive, that doesn't give you the right to say that they are being greedy.
---
Furthermore, the skins are purely cosmetic, why do you care? Since you brag about your F2P accounts on CR and CoC, it shouldn't matter if they are expensive, right?
---
The Lunar New Year pack is fine, it is better than the level 50 pack which most "casual" players won't reach until after this event (most as in a lot, Supercell knows how to market their games haha) since the game went global recently, this is a major step up for other players, and you need to consider that before attacking Supercell like that with accusations of being "greedy", while they can be considered to be greedy in other games they have made in the past, they are not being greedy here.
---
They aren't being greedy on this end, you are not considering the inner machinations that happen in Supercell to influence their decisions.
---
u/NadoBR, could you kindly stop complaining about cosmetics? :)
---
I disagree. They hear the community, I could mention many things that they did for us.
---
If you were talking about that why did you not say best design team
---
Ok that's epic 
---
Like how everybody turns on each other at the same time
---
I agree, but you need to recognize how level deals were offering more gems during beta, and reduced later on. It's the same case with Clash Royale, where arena packs initially had more  value to them. Sure, cosmetics are optional. But it's still a product I'm paying for at the end of the day.
---
The Game was not shown in match history because it was not finished. If you look after it now, it will show. However.... The timing was really strange and it happened to me too. 
---
Maybe it‚Äôs a sync error, meaning that you already died to that bull, but your game wasn‚Äôt synced with the server so it won‚Äôt show you and instead disconnects you until your in sync again.
---
Id rather they just remove the character from the game. The cancer of showdown
---
I m not saying I am in the best band but in top global band like top 100
---
Hey, are you the real one? üòÅ

You need to get downvoted -1000times

So it was true!

---
At 0.15 that moris should have attacked you. But he was a noob
---
This skin should have been on el primo. I mean, if someone is a football star its got to be el primo
---
It‚Äôs called money, that‚Äôs the point
---
nice
---
Dude your gold holy shit gimme some
---
Had a couple of matches with players teaming up, its very unfair but managed to turn the tides around. 
---
1) Go get a team. Don't gamble with randoms if you can't afford to lose.
---
2) Like I said, bad team comp. It doesn't matter what level that bull is, if you're playing Mortis you're going to lose.
---
The only problem with this is that the good players will be more likely to see this and more likely to be willing to share their stats, anyways, I at 5100 with everyone except for the legendaries. I have about 230 solo wins and 100 duos
---
It does actually. Try on rock wall brawl
---
Are u sure about that? I just spent have an hour doing it with my friends
---
But duo is a different mode
---
I want to play solo and others should play the mode solo too, that's the game, being the king of the hill
---
Just tested it also works with primos attack.
---
(Btw the stone walls and the skeleton obstacles need to be touching
---
I hope the level 15 pack comes on, because if it does I will get it and buy serenade poco. I‚Äôm not a fan of any of the other skins except pocos and darryls 
---
Lmao those r bones
---
Why? It's my favourite showdown map. Do something against teaming.
---
Ya it‚Äôs going to be a feature for competitive players for now, the servers can‚Äôt handle all the new players records as well
---
Welp I need this now
---
Signed
---
It does give u stuff it automatically gave u powerpoints and coins. And u didn‚Äôt unlock a new brawler
---
Does his attack change?
---
One upvote = one new brawler for this bad boi.
---
i know haha
---
or Mortis :D
---
Can't wait for Gene.
---
r/rareinsults 
---
Where's the ammo bar of your mortis?ü§î
---
Wow the dumpling Darryl skin comes with matrix madness, now I‚Äôm for sure getting it :O!
---
Lol good stuff dude üëåüèº
---
No it my favorite map in friendly games but not on ranked.
---
Ive been playing for one week, 1750 trophies, 9 brawlers (trophie road + darryl, poco &amp; el primo). 320 3v3 wins, 23 solo wins, 2 duo wins. My main tactic for getting trophisch right now is snatching a 4th, 3rd or 2nd place in showdown. 
---
True! It will be more creative 
---
I know, man, like $10 each. That‚Äôs just too much.
---
Obviously it's a mini. 
---
Gold gets useless in the higher ranks
---
Swipe left or right on your character
---
I know, I wanted them too. For $10 a piece, I‚Äôll pass.
---
Would be nice if Supercell gave us some data to get the bigger picture
---
This map is incredible just feels amazing to play in
---
Lower the skin PRICE!
---
Yes losing is part of the game. Yes losing from being out skilled is also part of it. Im just extremely annoyed with being matched with an enemy group well over my trophy and power. 
---
Omgod yes! Yes it happens if i play for a while
---
i accidentally uploaded this gonna delete soon
---
Thanks due
---
For anyone wondering if i'm high or not, look at the translation for "showdown" in the video above.

---
So your darryl need to be maxed to be usefull?
---
i cant thank the nita enough for spawning her bear tbh
---
best comment
---
I‚Äôd love if supercell introduce more icons
---
his super is trash
---
Unlikely you‚Äôll get 20 gems in 2 weeks time. If you like it I recommend you spend a few bucks because it‚Äôs gone otherwise:/
---
Btw how to spell buetifull I'm from Belgium so I don't know
---
Maybe it is really  trump
---
But that doesn't explain why Darryl's skin has effects and only costs 80 gems.
---
I‚Äôm in the EXACT same position as you and I‚Äôm not sure what to do, got the Rico skin before it changed and now I‚Äôm considering buying the ones you mentioned.
---
Thanks genius
---
xd i got 36k gold its worthless when ur maxed
---
sort of. i got him to 500 without it (pre-buff). he is just a million times better with it
---
Nice!
---
Its  a Bot frontera supercell
---
Pretty sure it is different. There's a sparkle animation when the rockets burst from contact or range. It's a small detail but there
---
 
---
Thank you.
---
Rico‚Äôs and lobbers: allow us to introduce ourselves
---
Ik but hopefully not
---
should i get him and another skin or pocos skin only
---
It happens so often it's a joke. I don't think it's 'part of the game' no logical human will avoid hitting another brawler that close to you. 
---
You‚Äôve gotten 64 downvotes from this post lol
---
There is a confirm button now .
---
First legendary out of the 4K mega box. Kinda glad it was Crow. He‚Äôs really unique and requires skill to play effectively. 
---
yeah, totally
---
Ur welcome /s
---
Maybe change the caption to "when you've watched too much Fox News"...
---
i autoaimed a bunch close range. but i mean...shelly....

cant auto aim those jukes tho ;)

a bit too high????? 10dollars for low quality skins are ridiclious
---
darryl in skull creek
---
but the rocket is blue, right? it has nothing to do with the color of the skins,
---
why? because u dont feel special anymore ?
---
yeah idk how. i guess matchmaking gods went easy on me and didnt give me matches with 9 throwers
---
Nice. I got crow as my first leggie at 5k-ish trophy too. Best brawler for me so far, it's fun poking poison at other people lol
---
All they‚Äôve said is mid february
---
It‚Äôs really up to you. All of the limited time skins will most likely appear in the future, so don‚Äôt buy them if you only want their exclusivity. If you like the skin, buy it for sure! I don‚Äôt personally, so I‚Äôm waiting for the Poco skin. 
---
Skins are really for your enjoyment, so buy the ones you like the most.
---
( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞ )
---
Yeah, I don't get it.  
---
What's going on here? Explain it to a noob please :)

good luck!

Sorry but they won‚Äôt

An impressive feat considering Fox news isn't shown in the UK...

I did with Nita and work as well

yeah i had an internal facepalm when i saw that

You‚Äôre joking

https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/alqgao/dumpling_darryl_shoots_mini_dumplings/?utm_source=reddit-android
---
Where can i get those figures? You have a shop or something?
---
So, assuming your chance is 0.2, you're complaining that you didn't get an 11% drop rate? They need money somehow. I don't have a legendary either, and I've spent money on the game too. There's no real reason to complain.
---
Yea they only implement 1/3 because most of them are stupid
---
for god sake dude what kind of lag u got there hahaha btw what is ur phone though ?
---
I'm bothered that this isn't marked as Humor flair
---
I wish I was joking, but it's that bad I can push brawlers easily on showdown up until teamers start appearing more and more (around 350 trophies) and clanmates aren't always available so I want some teammates who can actually play this game
---
Best story ever, I got Leon after a ton of grinding this game and then my friend at 900 trophies gets Spike from a random box. Fml.
---
Eh yes they do, it's the odds of 10 normal boxes per mega for legendary. It's like opening 120 normal boxes
---
Hahaha ok, best advice: dun play with randoms xd
---
Repost, take my downvote.

[I made Darryl.](https://images.uline.com/is/image/content/dam/images/Class-Group/c29/g220/g_2087.jpg?$BrowseRHD$&amp;iccEmbed=1&amp;icc=AdobeRGB)
---
I‚Äôve done it for 50. Just make the enemy drop the ball near the water
---
Then there is no way to get it back
---
I can get behind that, since they do need to make money out of it, which would make more sense why they should‚Äôve put the offer to $5, so people feel like they are getting much more value, and therefore will get more buyers.
---
Crows skin is 300...
---
Ohhh nooo I think he meant the Leon auto aimed 
---
I just noticed how spikes head looks at Shelly as she moves talk about attention to detail
---
ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
It doesn‚Äôt factor that in because you aren‚Äôt literally opening 10 boxes you just get 10x the amount of stuff.
---
ikr
---
with the special offer in shop it‚Äôs not...
---
Yeah I‚Äôve seen some clips like that. Its getting out of hand. One of the devs responded to my post saying they‚Äôre working on a fix
---
it's a smurf and 910 is nothing special
---
Jeez! It‚Äôs broken
---
And to get the fuck away from a battle
---
Read mega box info man. You are mistaken
---
you wouldnt have killed him anyways. you wouldve hit him once and made him have 200hp and then while you are waiting for your next shot he wouldve ulted away.
---
i want to be good at brawl stars lmao i dont have any money to spend on the game so therefore i can't progress as fast as all of the people who do spend money
---
I love that Spike plush so much
---
It says they have ten times more than regular but if what you are saying is true you could get more then one brawler per big box
---
They should add a brawler who can use water
---
I unlocked poco in a free Blue Box today!!
---
Teamof 7 nice

with the special offer it‚Äôs cheaper sherlock üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 
---
i did not really enjoyed this event. Seems like this is an event made just for the own supercell, once it gives only gifts that need money to get it. I think New skins, new interface and a new soundtrack on the navigation screen doesnt mean nothing for the players. We like the bonuses, extra coins, power ups and new challenges that remet us to the theme. I hope supercell could think more about the players instead the players money next time.
---
He‚Äôs coming at the end of this current season so a week and a half about
---
I agree with the first two points, but i disagree with the third. I think the prvious version was too much focused on killing each other while the mod is meant to be for goals and not kills. I think the very first version did it the best but thr current one is still better than the first.
---
I‚Äôm gonna use a gift card I got from my birthday to buy Dumpling Darryl. Does that make me p2p?
---
Wow
---
There should be a gray circle around your character that automatically deals 10% of anyone's and yourselfs hp if none of them attacks each other for, idk, 2-3 seconds. Walls and being inside a bush interrupts the gray circle. 
---
Fin
---
bo?
---
What kind of idiot compares the normal price of a skin to an offer price skin... üòÇ
---
Dumpling Darryl is definitely my favorite of the 3 and it helped that he is the cheapest too üòä
---
compare this to lol skins and then tell me again how this quality is on the same level?
---
Alright Ill quote it for you then. " you get 10 random draws, each with these reward probabilities: " (goes on to show brawler box probabilty).
---
you‚Äôre an idiot bud
---
Laugh whatever you whant mate. The true is, you cant get a rank 20 brawl at 1.5k trophies thats why you are mad. But its ok. Someday you will do something that makes you feel proud of your shitty life. Peace mate.
---
Crow...
---
Maybe wider goals and further spawns, cuz that will not affect the flow of the game as much.
---
Look in the ball
---
Still slowly rolls 
---
*Hey just noticed..* it's your **2nd Cakeday** BRzerks! ^(hug)
---
Che culo di merdaaa io non trovo niente
---
Beat me I used dynamike in 200+ , me and 4 other ppl left , mofos teamed up on me 
---
the issue for me is that it will be bulls paradise. because spawns are quite close bulls will be able to rush and kill when just out of immunity. Ranged attackers will have to back off. Other issue is that bulls will be able to sit in the middle and as the poison comes in they will be able to pick off ranged attackers funneling through the centre circle
---
I don‚Äôt think it will happen because if they do it, they break all the first day bought player....
---
They are all at max level, you can‚Äôt tell til the end of the game
---
Recycling bin acshuallllyyyyyy
---
I think same.
---
Safe doesn't last enought and It somewhat made trowers less effective.
---
It's still much less than what they would've gotten.
---
But you are right, and that's why I said *may*. I'm still on the fence about it. I *really* like the skin but it does feel shitty to support them here.
---
The price is the same for everyone. Your currency is just weaker, but based on exchange rates you‚Äôre still paying the same amount for gems. 
---
It always reminds me of like when in a movie there‚Äôs a fish then a bigger fish eats it then it just majestically disappears.
---
Found the teamer.

And now he is clickbating brawl stars videos!

Or have it fit the game mode you‚Äôre playing, for example purple for gem grab and green for showdown. 
---
Teamed
---
saw u in matches a bunch of times 
---
(sorry for the quality) 
---
Idk about ruined the map but I definitely liked it better before. 
---
I'm mad? Lol, haha. You're the only here that is mad, just look at your comments and I'm the one who's mad? Haha, cry more kid.
---
Also, you're so stupid. We're talking about a game and you're talking about my life? What does my life have to do with this game? Lol, also, I'm already proud of my life, different from yours where you only know to be stupid on the internet.
---
Again, I will laugh about your shitty comment. 
---
Oh my goodness yes
---
That isn't yours, you dont have talent
---
I think the whole idea was to make it so throwers didn't dominate the game type as much 
---
When you pay miners below minimum wage
---
Maybe they are planning in a remodel.
---
They said in the middle of the month
---
I think so .. or maybe its a misunderstood from myself..  . Ok thanks for the information anyway ! :)
---
Cool
---
Omg. Kiddo, get a life. Im mad about getting downvoted for saying the true. But as always humanity believes in lies. Keep it up.
---
Dude you paid 10$ FOR THAT! Feels bad man
---
Dude you are so awesome! It's great that you keep doing these cool clay models! Really amazing work!
---
Exactly the same I think i am going to get darryl last and i love that skin
---
You should have told supercell to unlock Leon for you so you can ‚Äúsee better‚Äù
---
That was great! 
---
You stupid it‚Äôs brown look it up
---
What does 75 contain?
---
I think so. But I've bought them all so I can't tell.
---
Also 3 barleys in bandit stash not breaking the TNT but Going over the Corners and breaking the safe through supers.
---
Which is based from Battle Royale.
---
yeah lol
---
It was a pleasure, your idea was brilliant! Congratulations for the initiative, if you have any other ideai can communicate me
---
Love the art style :)
---
That was really crazy! 
---
That is not how a petition works
---
They sure do! Thank you very much!
---
I'd like if they made it so if you tapped the super button while he's charging he stops charging
---
Filthy teamers
---
I only play sd lol
---
But you didn‚Äôt give a tip, you just said there was a tip
---
i been know this
---
People still underestimate Mortis
---
Thanks man
---
Nice skin idea and art! Would love to see this skin in the game, very clever concept!
---
Oh, this is too cute!!! Thank you for sharing!
---
I need this type of skill
---
But then in the comments you said the wrong trophy loss/gain and when someone called you out you didn‚Äôt answer. I‚Äôm not trying to be rude but maybe it‚Äôs not true?
---
Id buy it tbh
---
Thanks! And yes, I'm one of the fan art contest winners :)
---
Removed. Keep your post titles descriptive and provide context. Additionally do not use low effort/all caps/clickbait titles.

he can 2 shot showdown boxes now and his starpower is insanely useful

Huuuh?

Please Decrease The Prices please
---
Repost
---
Dura Mike ‚ÄúDuracell ‚Äú hahaha Italiano √®?
---
Its true 
---
Yes, offers for every brawler rarity will appear in the shop at some point. Epic brawlers cost 170 gems, Mythic brawlers cost 350 and Legendary brawlers are 700 gems. Note that these prices are not discounted, most of the time they will have a 20-30% discount, making the offer considerably cheaper. 
---
Well it actually increased by 120 gems and now costs 150. Sadness rip.:(:(
---
Ok i will stop doing that
---
I feel like 150 is too much for a rare brawler 
---
Wasn‚Äôt clickbait lol, the bundle comes with 170 gems. Check your shop
---
Gene is coming out in the middle of the month.
---
Holy shit!
---
A few thoughts:
---
1) as soon as I saw you were Frank and a few descriptor words were 'epic', 'win', 'team' and 'funny', I knew immediately it would involve the super hammer of stun!
---
2) Never once did I imagine you using the aforementioned super hammer of stun like 18 times.
---
3) Lol
---
YOO This is great!! Also a welcoming welcome back for the keyboard in the back ;))
---
They won't come back, there is also one  for lvl 75
---
3.5 K trophies and level 10 brawlers‚Ä¶ _*P A Y 2 W I N I N T E N S I F I E S_*

---
Imagine dying 9th as Mortis only to show us a bug... A true hero!
---
I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôll be enough but best of luck
---
Really mice 
---
Thanks man!
---
False
---
My only level 10 brawler. Not hard when you don't use your coin or gems on anything other than a specific card, an leveling the one brawler up. 
---
I +1 that
---
AHAHHAHAHA
---
First, start with 2 mega boxes. Those both cancel out.
---
So now we have: 100 gems and 2000 coins vs 170 gems and 1500 coins.
---
So, now we‚Äôre stuck with this question: Is the difference between 70 gems and 500 coins equal? Short answer, NO.
---
In the store, you can buy 400 coins for 50 gems, and 150 coins, for 20 gems. 
---
With that, that is 500 total coins is less valuable then 70 gems, because you could buy 550 coins with the extra 70 gems that you get from the level 50 offer.
---
Therefore, if you have both offers available, or you‚Äôre close to level 50, I strongly recommend either buying both because their both great offers, but if you have to choose one, buy the level 50 offer!
---
2 mega box, 170 gems and 3500 gold for $14,99
---
Read my comment
---
ikr.. noticed it too.. bad design. IMO it's fine that the ball can go into water, it can't just act as if there is an invisible wall around it,
---
BUT it should float to the nearest edge in like 1-2 sec. OR just remove all water from Brawl Ball lol
---
Yeah u have to be accurate and hope the brawler don‚Äôt spawn across the goal(1 on top of the other)
---
They‚Äôre working on beginning and mid game content they‚Äôll work on late game after 
---
Yea idk how people are so low trophies with level 10s
---
I think u mixed the two?
---
lol
---
Mortis, bringer of darkness
---
Wtf bad deal for a maxed player
---
I highly agree! LOL
---
Your comment literally states that the lunar new year one is better by 50 coins
---
With 70 gems, you could buy 550 coins. The 50 pack is worth more
---
yeah its annoying
---
Yes indeed
---
I get the point but nobody chooses coins over gems tbh lol
---
I don‚Äôt think so but I‚Äôm not 100% about it.
---
any gameplay of old darryl?
---
Yeah, he basically explained why lunar year offer is better but mixed up which is which.
---
You get 2 trophies for each win so yeah he's insane he got 100% win rate.
---
Same!
---
Great idea
---
ioi
---
Atleast i got token doubler from it üòã

Honestly with the cost of these skins im just saving gems for valentine poco

I just won a bot fc match with Rico in Cavern Churn. It‚Äôs actually pretty good.
---
I‚Äôm assuming they played non sd events if they were above 500 for a character.  This meaning their teammates could be high in skill with max brawlers.
---
wow! thank you!
---
I didn't know Gene's Super can pull a full-size Robo. Hay gh√™.
---
Honestly,people are gonna team on u just cuz ur a leon
---
That doesn‚Äôt prove anything, I‚Äôm talking about 500+
---
My lunar offer is $15 üò´ I would have bought it for 5 but not spending 15...
---
I think two is annoying enough, Dynamike is a pain in the ass and I'd prefer to keep that role to a minimum

wanna play with me? #YUV2Y8U

he like
---
Yes this is definitely brawl stars related content
---
Nice
---
I thought I would get pranked by just showing a blank picture. I was wrong. 
---
Of course 
---
I'm saving for Gene because i already have all brawlers
---
Getting a brawler to 500 doesn‚Äôt mean you will get them to lvl 9 in the same amount of time, that just doesn‚Äôt happen.

Never mind o gotta go

Yes, the only reason I have semi-high lvl brawlers is because of the old systems.

No problem .. sure
---
Got confused, meant lunar sorry
---
So you posted an opinion and tried to trick everyone as if it were a fact?
---
Thank you for your compliment.

Dude you must be the most stupidest kid I know I hope your joking about not getting it it is so simple even a blind man can see it

Rico looked like a badass cowboy, had a real pistol, physique, *a hat!* The new Rick is fat, no cowboy, no hat, and shoots toy balls rather then bullets. He reminds me of one of those toys you move and it makes the balls pop everywhere.

So please do the math for us then :)

Very nice

I got Leon at 1395.. 2663 now and got Frank through that time. Buying the Lunar offer tho, wish me luck!
---
The 2 teams : 1st team:piper,brock,colt
---
2nd team:piper,brock,colt
---
It‚Äôs stupid. Some players have all brawlers to 400 trophies but for others is not that easy!!!
---
11k tr and I never played showdown
---
WHY! Bush jokes are not funny. Bull and shelly are trash in showdown and almost every game mode. Have you ever heard of teaming? Well try bush camping against teamers, noob. Just play heist if you don't know how to shoot at a bush.
---
‚ù§np, you should sell them it looks perfectly done unless you wanna keep it for yourself which i would do! Im sure a lot of ppl would buy it tho..
---
Imma have to follow u this is just... üëåüëåüëè
---
Thank you so much
---
Its restricted to brawlers above 400 because supercell needs to test the replay system to make sure their servers can handle it before releasing it to everyone
---
https://progameguides.com/brawl-stars/brawl-stars-skins-list/
---
Not the best but its okayyyyy
---
-6 ain‚Äôt that bad chill out, just play more games 
---
Literally the only thing they have to do to fix the spawn in goal problem is to increase the amount of time it takes to respawn after death. Just increase it by as long as it took to get from behind the goal to the front of the goal before. Probably add 2.5 seconds to the respawn timer. Then the punishment for dying will actually be sufficient and goals will happen way more frequently
---
Is becuz they are testing it, otherwise the servers will crash
---
Stupid teamer!
---
#spintowin
---
The main idea behind it its the server capacity,i believe that sc didnt give bs all the servers they asked for so in order to dont lose gameplay quality they limited the amount of replays there can exist for the overall good ,more like a ..."its all we can give you for now" situation.Anyways,if there is just one brawler above 400 in that game repetition will be made and accesible for all,i mean you can play with a friend and tell him to get a 400 brawler etc..
---
Start crashing a lot lately, got tired and quit lol.
---
Yeah.. but people will always be eager by a modes to come out.  
---
And my point isnt to have all the modes 24/7 but to have a better balance between the modes cause now it's like SD &gt;&gt; Gem &gt; Heist, Braw Ball &amp; Bounty   
---
Id take all the El Primos from this world for a spike
---
I ended up buying both of them. Welp, I am no longer a free to play player, goodbye my money.

Nice question
---
Who is gene?
---
I haven‚Äôt played since global release?
---
This a wack map 
---
Yes I know, we F2P havent got maxed bo so we cant deal so good with those tanks, except playing shelly or tanks...
---
I wanted to be provocative 
---
i was expecting NANI? but nice animation lol

Same for me, really frustrating.
---
It might be only on weekends
---
Shuttup, showdown is supposed to be a fair game mode, it says it when you start, ALL BRAWLERS FOR THEMSELVES. No one except stupid idiots consent with teaming.
---
Bulls bulls in the bush
---
No Problem :D 
---
Remember kids!
---
The water slows down the ball, but it's not like if the ball don't get out of it!
---
I know about the Battle log, but I don't see anything about replays there. Also I'm not a new player.
---
I‚Äôm a simple man. I see Shapiro, I upvote.
---
It does matter what you do, do you think it is fair if one person has to try and win against nine people. Have you ever even played SOLO showdown? It says all brawlers for themselves. You think brawl stars is a game where you win with no skill. You're letting other people get your trophies for you. It's rotten and should get banned.
---
Yes, thank you.
---
Dude chill! 
---
Me toooo aaah!! Good thing I bought it ü§©
---
So?just because someone got lucky first mean that you will too,I'm currently at 4.5k and I didn't have any epics mythic or legendaries until 3k so be patient you'll get them eventually
---
bruh moments 
---
They are both fine after the recent update
---
Le√≥n should have gone invisible when Nita hugged him
---
Now we need:    
---
Dypa Mike (geriatric dyna mike in adult diapers)    
---
Dino Mike (Dinosaur)    
---
Diva Mike (Scuba Diver)    
---
Dial-a-Mike (Male escort)
---
T H E    L E A R N I N G   C H A N N E L

Where‚Äôs he at?

I really can't say anything for mortis that isn't possible for any other star power brawler and the fact that on his own you can't really say he's even mediocre. Frank on the other hand has good range and good damage plus even a high reload, the only bad thing you notice is he self stuns when he attacks making his attack immobile making his range feel shorter even though it's longer than shelly's range in some balance changes.
---
a regular match..?
---
You don‚Äôt have to use those guys to win. I usually use penny in showdown and tend to win or come second. If you play well, you shouldn‚Äôt be consistently losing to bull and Shelly 
---
Am I the only one who thought the Shelly was bending over and the chair was her ass and thigh? No? Just me? Ok
---
almost 40 seconds*

---
Ok L I B T A R D. But seriously what‚Äôs wrong with Shapiro?
---
Same thing here. I updated my iPhone (6s) and now it crashes at the start of the game maybe 1 out of 3 or 4 games. Better than nothing. Usually still alive when I get back in lol 
---
ZigZag Bonanza
---
That's the best deal I have ever seen main wish i had that offer
