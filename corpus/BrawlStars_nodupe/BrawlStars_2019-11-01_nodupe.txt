No thanks my great grand mother, merry poppins

Yes, ive been waiting for someone to be mortis and this looks amazing, happy halloween!

Siege is a pretty poorly designed mode.  
---
Most of the time, after surviving a bot attack the enemy has already regrouped and is pinging away at collecting bolts whilst you and your allies are all over the shop trying to recover. Then the next bot comes.  
---
Needs some kind of recoup period where bolts don't spawn after a bot has been downed to allow both teams to get into position - how often do you lose because you didn't get the first bot? Far too often.

You are an imbecile with a lack of brain cells. Remember yourself saying "Anyone who thinks star Shelly is better than witch Shelly is either a moron or a f2p who doesn’t have the gems to buy witch Shelly and is just trying to cheer themselves up."? That's your sorry ass attacking people who thinks star shelly is better than witch shelly and I give no fucks about you disagreeing with people but you are attacking other people who thinks star shelly is better, dumb shit

---
I made a similar complaint about the bush camping. The fact that someone can get the power cup and still disappear in the bushes is the worst! For me bull isn’t the biggest issue it’s Leon. Having the ability to be in the bushes, go invisible, and move wherever makes him the ultimate cheat code. Also, the ability for someone in the bush to auto-aim their attack is also the worst! My suggestion was to limit the line of site for someone in the bush.

Ive tried 800+ trophies showdown,and holy shit they're all complete losers that cant accept a loss.
---
Thats why i stick to 3v3 modes,because not everyone is a retarded child with 47 chromosomes
---
Guy only had 1600 overall trophies and his highest brawler is 300. This needs to stop!!!
---
For myself new stuff is that I get 2-3 three crappy uneven games at the start of every new level. Yesterday gem grab with 400 trophy randoms (me being at 700) for two games and I was no longer even near of 700. Then got a normal game and won it.
---
I don't see an issue. I think getting something for free is better than throwing 150 gems for it
---
*Thank you for finally being the chosen one*

This is Lwarb map!!! It's not yours!

Crow has just closed his eyes
---
Were u auto aiming?
---
Really balanced, not too heavy on the invisiheal side
---
They need to revert the nerf
---
Think of this scenario: the 7th brawler just died, you are now in the top 3 so you know you're gonna get trophies then you decided that you'll just let the bot play for you cuz you know you're still gonna get trophies.
---
Hi.. Can i record this gameplay and post it on my Youtube channel (Lang Buaya Gaming)?

I will put your Reddit name in this video.

just no

Just stop
---
Don't worry, I've enough diamonds saved to get Spike next time he's on sale, so he'll be nerfed then.
---
Yes, I agree. Leon is really good in solo, but not in 3v3. I wish there was a way to buff him for 3v3 a bit, but not affect solo games. I can’t think of a way to do this, so ideas would be nice.
---
Well we screwed
---
I see. Nice observation you have done. But don't you think that the power level should also be taken into account as these things will demotivate the emerging competitive players.

The 1st,the chance of winning against teamers is high since they will probably end attacking each other and die in a short amount of seconds,thanks to that 1 dumbass mecha bo.
---
Puper can touch you 1 time and do 2000 damage and heal so amny hp.

Tick is very annoying because of his fast super dealing a lot of damage and healing, and his main  attack mines.

Its a free puppy to bad hes not free in the game

White Crow is a simple recolor, Calavera Piper is actually has a costume modell. Obviously Calavera Piper is the better

What if Leon is really that smol in the actual game?
---
Such controversy. Sit back and watch the opinions separating the world in two parts.
---
You can also show it a reverse uno card
---
Reasoning don't make sense to me. Even pros have specific brawler mains, and it doesn't matter, because SC still gets a consumer whether they're so-called one tricks or not. If I'm going for power points, I'll play the other brawlers anyway; if I'm not, I'll only be playing my mains anyway. And arguably after a certain point, you have to main a few specific brawlers if you really want to master their play.) So it doesn't force people to do shit.

They  need someway to earn cash. Just like the power play event. You barely get jack shit if lose all the time and only only a little you win some. As stated, they give good stuff, but only little good stuff
---
I think it is strawberry
---
r/20wordslimit
---
You can't buy power points with cash.
---
Fellow Terrarian, Fellow Lordranian, etc...
---
Now give him shuriken and all’s good
---
No, I Just had an idea to remove eyes from every brawler
---
Believe me, it gets worse at higher trophies (especially at brawlers with 600-700 trophies)
---
Well Vampires hate Werewolves
---
True
---
Now for the big question, Do you have Leon in your account?
---
Oh Lee shit
---
Matchmaking only depends on the brawler's individual trophies.
---
Nope, but they do allow you buy stuff which usually need cash. Which results in lesser need to buy igc to buy boxes
---
I don’t get it. Why are you just holding nothing? Where is he? I want to see him
---
I used a split screen glitch and took 3 screenshots and connected them all
---
How much difference would an extra 40-60 points per 800 brawler make? How many players even have 800 brawlers?
---
Dyan
---
If they had your way of thinking. They wouldnt be offering such shitty offer like 30gems for 150coins or something
---
Take my upvote good sir
---
Im still doing the other 4 skins, I'll post them all soon enough :3
---
Can you make the same thing but with overwatch? However upovote :)
---
This is perfect
---
See u in hot
---
The laggg
---
This hits right in the feels man. Crow was the first brawler i pushed to 600, once i got there i went on a losing streak. I went from like 615 down to about 465. I was so mad at the time, but now i look back and i should have just stopped pushing, not to mention i was playing with randoms.

Brawl stars is better than zooba
---
Reason why you pick invisiheal instead of smoke trails generally, smoke trails I would say is better in lonetsar, takedown, showdown basically the solo modes. The advantage invisiheal has over smoke trails is the massive healing capabiliities for Leon and makes him handle his counters such as Crow better. I do know most people complain about how the healing is not Leon's playstyle and they start whinning but it covers a weakness which is always a benefit.
---
What if you’re not Christian
---
Bot Shelly though
---
And why i dont have humor? YOU DONT HAVE HUMOR BECAUSE YOU THINK THAT A CUTE LITTLE BABY WHIT LEON COSTUME IS NOT CUTE
---
My best character is Penny and usually I get the star player every time I play with her. That’s why I thought maybe Piper would be similar and maybe a little better for solo play
---
This is fine

And then you say that I DONT HAVE HUMOR!

Amazing but if it had effects it will cost ya extra 70 gems

I know he’s cute
---
Cool but the sub's rules say that it needs to be related to brawl stars.
---
BITCH HOLD ON
---
Doesn't really fit here
---
Then you would consider this sub a sin, in which case you would do anything to corrupt what once was pure and turn it in a desecrated pile of shit, similar to what these miscreant non-believers are trying to do since the opening of the rules.

Rockabilly Mortis IS the best

Good work though

If Primo can touch you, you're playing wrong.
---
So if the enemy team primo is better than yours it means they are playing better.
---
Still, it's a great achievement
---
Why dont you try a low trophy brawler
---
cool
---
You look dope

I will say the truth and you shouldnt be proud of it, for the next time put more effort in it and dont show it as a masterpiece

Pay to Play is well used terminology. There is no such thing as "an official term" since both are informal.

Pretending like there are any social doctrines or mandates determining their use is being needlessly pompous and annoying.

Only if you can prove it? Ur actually the first “beta player” I’ve seen that have actually said that. I don’t believe this “only wish” you have because most players never thought of this sudden change and never expected landscape. Your profile also doesn’t have a single post on this sub that was posted during the beta times...
---
Nice balance changes supercell, make invisiheal broken af but nerf leons base kit...very nice supercell, very nice...
---
I don't remember the video link
---
Of course not, they only give the gems. It’s an *opportunity* to buy any one (or more) of all the skins, not buying every single one
---
Nice
---
Is there an official source? Or just a lot of he/she said.
---
It was kind of short too, but it did tell the backstories of the Brawlers.

52 minutes later, i find this post, and sadly, its not in hot. Why ? I have no clue people are dumb idk

Heh. He's actually offering unused candy. Either way he's going to be disappointed that he loses his lollipop
---
Leon is still good...

they said they aren't making any changes to the trophy road
---
I thought that was the reason that Nita was so aggressive because he wouldn't cough it up

Good idea!

What is with this choosing star power? is there multiple star powers for each legend now? can you get multiple for each legend?

Bloody hell mate

---
What u mean by open someone's account
---
It's a mistake to even browse this sub.
---
Yeah you are right there but this time the Mortis didn't act like a dick.
---
Some peoples did 30k trophy but they aren't maje change? Soo absurd.
---
Who knows, Lollipops may actually contain alot of sentimental value to Leon
---
Then again, once you're consuming a lollipop, you probably shouldn't give it to someone unless you got a spare
---
I'd only get behind this if it were 1 per season, but even then Brawl Stars seasons are short. This would only work if it had the minimal impact on economy. The rates would also have to be obscene.
---
Guitar?
---
Nita is now on dark side minvile poco is in Sans mode
---
Oh
---
Ifvthey afk for a long time they start moving but qre bots also you can know if you are playing friendly games or a tick just rushes you and missesbevery single shot
---
Never thought of that. Thought he just likes candy
---
But against the player...
---
Bot piper is pretty insane too. They use ambush to its fullest and it’s terrifying
---
Bot Bo!
---
Nope,  its your opinion so why we do the same?

Yes 🤔❤

A little bit disturbing but I like it😂😂😂

At least put it back to 7 seconds I could understand that. 6 seconds is just too much
---
Next balance chamges: i'm about to end this ~~man~~ plant's whole career
---
Star shelly?
---
Bot colt is op aswell
---
I did say one per season, and I guess the gem cost could be somewhat higher, maybe 200 or 250. Also they’d have to classify skins by rarity, so they could show percentage chance of a drop. Also, since there are no pity rates, your chance of getting a “legendary” skin (Witch Shelly, Popcorn Rico, Mecha Bo) would could stay at .5% for forever. This keeps these skins exclusive and they’d still make a lot of money off of shop releases if them because it’s way cheaper to buy it then try for it out of a loot box.
---
Yeah your right :(
---
Sure!

I pick invisiheal because i dont have smoke trails jaja

Yes or no...all thanks to "autoaim" for the second shot.

---

---

---
I still didn't get it on the shop... I really want to buy this skin
---
Yes i know, but bibi has this ability already
---
It is like breaking the fourth wall
---

---

---
Im no bot :)
---
Man though, I do wish I’d known about the game a few months before global release, but I only saw the ad on YouTube 6 months ago :/
---
I’m sorry man I just reread your post
---
Really who wil give you money for gems?
---
Do you know that there is some peole out there need this money for food, home or clothes?
---
#BEGGAR
---
Skin. Mega boxes are not worth it.
---
I'd go with bo hat lol
---
In what program you can make maps?
---
I do, and i actually started this for people who struggle on pushing trophies.
---
make it 30 or make the bullet effect have like a rose trail or make the super bombs skulls
---
33secs isnt much
---
reminds me bridges like in clash royale
---
Looks great!  Kinda looks like she has a 5 o’clock shadow though.  I’d lighten that area up.

#STOP TRYING TO GET FREE GEMS#

This man is galaxy brain just like me lololol
---
Local luchador married a barrel
---
stop being toxic kiddo, talk english if u have nuts.
---
Is big brain time.
---
so then why would you post this?
---
Good user name
---
Ikr lmao
---
There isn't any price set for 50 gems
---
maybe they should add new price sets like
---
15,50,100,125 and so on
---
Rico as well
---
Jeez, dude. Why the aggresso expresso?
---
You mean espresso ?
---
What does DK mean? Donkey Kong? XD
---
As a 750 trophies mortis player, I am sad to say your opinion is trash. You cant kill crow unless it walks to your bush without checking
---
An expresso is a train, right?
---
There is litterally a watermark in the bottom left, did nobody see that ?
---
Every time I find a teammate named "Spike" "Leon" "unlockleon.exe" and so on, I know it will end like that
---
I see you're a cultured man as well
---
An espresso is a drink, right ?
---
BOT COLT
---
A buff is an increase in a stat, right?
---
Spooky af
---
Your name and flair don't check out
---
A nerf is a decrease in stat, right ?
---
&gt;Brawlers like Poco, Frank, Pam and Rosa are honestly OP considering what super powers they got...
---
heres the quote.
---
A Crow is a bird, right?
---
I think you wanted to say one game away from 7000 trophies? Btw It Simply depends on how good you are with the brawler you use and on the opponents, so if you lose even if matchmaking was okay you were either unlucky or not careful, these are things that happen my friend
---
if you want to get all the brawlers then...
---
JUST DO IT! MAKE YOUR DREAMS COME TRUE! JUST DO IT!
---
I have automa-tick reload in my shop. Hmmmm
---
How did you get that Spike next to your name
---
Am I the only one that always plays brawl stars on mute?
---
Sorry This is sad
---
You can see Gedi-Kor’s name and info poorly covered up, this is stolen
---
Nor really stealing
---
needs more cover
---
Wtf how that early? Did you spent any money on the game? I’ve spent none so far.

---
Its youtubers DUH
---

---
LMAO 😂
---
I only have 166 gems tho
---
r/shittybrawlstars
---
My legendary chance is 0.14 btw
---
It's not easy to get if it's at the end of the rewards. You could get a random legendary out of a chest and it's still a legendary right?
---
One of the players in the enemy team was in a team
---
F for rico at 498
---
The menu is specifically from Brawl.
---
What do you mean? this is an concept art not actually from BS
---
So close
---
I meant there is no such thing as a like on Reddit

I don’t really get mad about things, but this...this makes me visibly angry
---

---
Theres a bounty map that is released and its mainly bushes
---
Nightmare fuel
---
Legit stuff! Very cool
---
I know, just thought it was kind of cool I faced a leaderboard player
---
Fair point, I’ve edited it to 50 gems
---
You make a good argument, now that I think about it, 50 gems actually does make a lot of sense.
---
1 last question: what is that new controller logo reward at the top of your post?
---
Its like a gold
---
I have an idea to nerf 8bits 2nd SP in Graveyard Shift: When he respawns have him spawn without the invincibility bubble
---
Mine choose answer f and don’t shit the rest of the match
---
Ah it was so long time that i didn't saw stealer

---
Invisiblilty being 7 seconds and invisiheal to 800?
---
Totally ignoring the brawl tv people watching..
---
Poco is a gentleman and plays music for Piper
---
16.7 k with 1 legendary
---
I have to agree!
---
Pinny

Respect the first rule. U don't have respect. BLOCKED

Yup, it is
---
I thought it was "Great Scott" like Doc from Back to the Future
---
What are you saying? Rockabilly Mortis is like No Hat Mortis, but cooler. We all know Top Hat Is Better.

Adult Jessie be like:
---
Teaming is a strategy to spin
---
Once again my opinion
---
Leon does a Doggo
---
Me too
---
\*Angry Thiccochet has entered the chat\*
---
It should be a little faster the animation
---
They don't even go for the powercubes they're just breaking the boxes and go somewhere...
---
Same. Jessie is too op in big game, not even fair
---
Idk
---
I was blowing my nose and saw the picture, dead ass my nose is clear now
---
*so you have Leon*
---
It's to be expected with such a skin or Leon in general.
---
Excuse me while I chew my pills
---
*cries in not having enough gems for either of them* 
---
(I’m not f2p but I’ve spent like $5 on the game)
---
Damm
---
There is a bug
---
Ok, thank you!
---
For a moment I thought you were talking about the brawler Leon until I saw bricks name
---
Even better.
---
I hate the poopies who do this
---
I am sorry for the inconvenience but you didn't had to bruh me. Also infuriating fact zoom in on the third line, you can see that it's not straight
---
So cool
---
They see me rolling, they haten
