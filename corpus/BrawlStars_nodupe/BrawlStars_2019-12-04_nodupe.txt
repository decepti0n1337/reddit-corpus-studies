U can buy star powers from the shop at a cheaper price so this is kind of useless.

Those are bots not real games

That would make so much sense! He throws ornaments that breaks into three shards when it touches the ground!

No, he genuinely sucks. Most team comps on BB are tank heavy, and shotgunners are nearly as common. It's rare to find anyone he's especially good against, and even if you do they're probably well tanked for by their teammates. Mortis is just a bad pick in BB
---
if it's snake praire yeah
---
Haha okay buddy. Was that you? You certainly seem suspiciously defensive. 
---
If you look closely, the Nita attacked up front after passing the ball to Primo. Which suggests they didn‚Äôt realise they had received the ball and continued on their auto-aim attacks thus passing to the primo and then in a case of delayed response the next attack went forward. Also, I hope you realise teammates can see where someone is aiming with the ball. It‚Äôs clearly a case of late reaction, which wasn‚Äôt even the point. The point was, when you use auto-aim you pass the ball right back to the opponent. Which is what happened. 
---
Also, I wasn‚Äôt even critiquing their strategy, but since you‚Äôve started it, I‚Äôll also add that passing the ball forward towards the opponent goal is what anyone would do, I don‚Äôt understand how that‚Äôs supposed to be out of the ordinary.

His invisibility meter will be OP in SD and lonestar and bad in every other mode. Him having a literal instakill button would make Bull, Bibi, Primo and Mortis useless. In 3v3 he can just corner camp or bush camp and then when he has 5k health he will use his super and kill the gem carrier and everyone else due to his speed

Yeah I don't think they're worth it. I got Night Mecha Crow without a second thought because it's one of my favourite skins in the game, and I will soon get Light Mecha Bo because I like it quite a lot too. But the others are more of the same but worse, I don't think I'd ever bother getting them.

Ive done it before, trying to dodge shots and get better positioning. He probably just got distracted for a second or something or got a bug because he didnt try to own goal again.

That's beyond science.

uhh...happy cake day? ":D

Bibi has the lowest power level in the game and the lowest brawler trophies, and overall trophies. And anyone that really plays this game knows that experience and skill are way more important than simply power level.

WOW !

Why open them if you get nothing out of them

There already is an OG skin: STAR SHELLY
---
And not to mention your team has 2 people with star powers which is a pretty decent advantage,  so really the other team were the ones with the disadvantage lol. Get good
---
Same man
---
Where is Leon buff?
---
I think it is
---
Mort-is
---
Brawl stars should make a skin for this
---
Everyone gets bad matchmaking sometime or another, posting a pic wont change anything so why bother?
---
Leon finally got buffed for christmas
---
But kids like you dont play by the rules,and guys like me it ain't easy to be played for fools
---
Wow this is great brawlstars content... Yep... Brawlstars content it is...
---
Yeah i understand... Thanks! Glad we have somewhere to rant about such stuff haha
---
Ny asshole has been demolished
---
Cool jessy skin
---
I don't get it
---
Brawlidays is coming open all box to come
---
I have star shelly but i think that less people will have Christmas skins because they cost money
---
well, 15k is not a pro anymore
---
So let's go, let the room get chiller. Let's go dirty brother killer.
---
Because of stealing kills
---
the balance changes just got released and there is no buff for leon but no nerf either
---
Ye  haha
---
I know üôÉ
---
More like 2 power cube and a robot vs 22 power cube. You just shot him once and than the robot did the rest lol
---
see u in hot :)
---
I agree, but maybe alternate stone and wood blocks to make it easier to find the range of the attack?
---
It wouldn't make sense for most of the brawlers like spike, bo, Shelly, colt ect cuz their design is mostly the same, the model is different, it would make a little sense only for Brock and rico
---
Yes
---
No, less reason; you still cant play every brawler on ranked, and most people play mostly ranked mode. Therefore, there would still be a reason to try to get more brawlers. Quite a big reason in fact.
---
12,5k trophies and no legendaries :/
---
Thats an ok idea if it wasnt foe shelly doopi lookin ass
---
You can use it
---
Now All she needs is a skin
---
Cmon give some love to the cashless kid
---
So go ahead and try to hit if your able,guess you figured out mercys of the table,
---
Amazing work!
---
14k trophies and I still don't have shelly
---
Jokes on them, I don't have max darryl anyways so he is still OP
---
Poco has ears :/
---
*THIS IS MY WORLD,YOU ARE NOT WELCOME IN MY WORLD!*
---
Poco: aW, tHaT sUcKs!
---
now no one will choose extra life over boosted booster
---
Brusry
---
8 more days till global anniversary!!!
---
:Tick: WOW
---
This isn't even close to OP
---
Even when i play dynamike and get cornered, i head for the opponent's dynamike cos ik he can't kill me close range haha
---
Please don't ask for support. The skin really doesn't make sense.
---
I guess, yeah. His design is based on a dragon, but he‚Äôs a flying type because he can fly ig
---
Supercell hates Leon confirmed
---
Why?‚äô_‚äô
---
Username checks out....
---
Guys?
---
On low powerplay the opponents are randoms too mostly
---

Well here you go ps i can post gameplay if you want :)
---
Or "Buff Leon"
---
Upvote cuz you worked hard for it
---
MORE BO SKINS
---
NI-
---
Flair checks out
---
As much as I want this, I don‚Äôt think Supercell has the resources to either:
---
a) have a team to review each report
---
b) have an auto system to analyze each report
---
It will just be spammed by salty idiots who died fairly
---
So realistic
---
üò°
---
Or they prefer that Brawler, maybe? I've had all the Brawlers for ages, but Mortis will always have a special place in my heart.
---
Do i get only 1 basic box from the tickets?
---
It's there, he just used his super that's why you can't see him.
---
So true,  give me some luck
---
i'm at 11.2k trophies and also have sandy and leon to unlock
---
We should remind supercell that Mortis exists.
---
Ala, um br!
---
Bruh!
---
No I‚Äôve seen a whole team stun and score with a trick shot
---
How the frick?
---
My water mark is literally everywhere
---
She shoots electric bullets and she has a pet made of steel :) and she is a mechanic ( steel type)
---
My other posts are more original, look at them
---
just continuing a joke
---
PAM: I
---
I like it
---
Those are just attack types (from her gun and with scraps she finds) but she isn‚Äôt like Nita or Mortis where they have something part of thyme to make them that type
---
Dang, maybe next time colt
---
Trophy changes at the end of the season. I was offline for a looooong time. Y u mad
---
Car noises intensified
---
Thanks!!üòÜ
---
That's how brawl stars works
---
And here I was thinking I couldn‚Äôt see anything more original (sarcasm)
---
This is a reposts. Not only were you begging for upvotes to post it. But you also didn't even make the damn thing.
---
only 2 days difference?
---
r/wooosh
---
No. Twice Auto aim goal.
---
Golden barley is my favorite barley skin this looks fantastic :)
---
[deleted]
---
Yes, inteleon shoots water from its fingers and thats why it is a water type, its a spy and its not a normal type. So what you can say now :)
---
For Bill Russell skin contest on Twitter.
---
But in different years
---
Yeah, BUT INSTEAD OF MAKING HER FUCKING USELESS LET'S JUST DELETE HER!
---
It's obvious that ur a noob that can't keep long distance away from Shellys
---
Cinderace is a fire type and it is a football player, so why it isnt a normal type
---
Noice
---
It‚Äôs not a normal type because it shoots water from its finger
---
I dont think this should be done, last thing we need for brawl starts is 9 year olds practicing their shots whole day and cranking 90s
---
I wish they just nerfed rico and penny, so many maps favor rico and penny doing 1260 damage really is scary
---
From a competitive pokemon playing standpoint, Fairy/Ghost and Steel are good typings. I'd wager throwing in Water/Steel too. Fighting/Dark is really rough, especially when you take into account moonblast/dazzling gleam.
---
yes he turns balanced when you level him up to level 4 when he reaches 1k damage but why not a small buff?
---
This was a friendly game to try to get the safe down as fast as possible, in a competitive match, you wouldn't be able to pull this off in a competitive match.
---
Is that normal when it does it beyond the game and shrinks in the corner?
---
Mr. Consistancy number 3
---
i have 5K and i have gene
---
When I hear Darryl is getting nerfed: üò©
---
Realizing its over star a power and my Darrly is power level 8:üòÅ
---
Ok
---
And it‚Äôs also a strange coincidence how he perfectly cropped it to show everyone his precious little Leon
---
Yea it was a friendly game
---
I dont know man, I'm having a hard time visualizing your description. I would really need a screenahot.
---
Who expected that?
---
Don‚Äôt worry I‚Äôm not mad :)
---
I would‚Äôve never thought of that not a bad idea
---
Imagine a Godzilla movie but all the roars are just Bull groaning
---
cause she needed a faster attack but i don't have an opinion on the scrappy buff
---
Sorry that I can't but thank you for your help
---
I really want a normal ghost type to be introduced somehow
---
Aaarg the hansom boi :)
---
I guess he bought gems then used them and refunded them. Supercell takes away the amount of purchased gems if you get a refund. Even if it means you get negative gems. Seems like he thought he could get some free gems.
---
Nice
---
I only bought sandy with Gems but any account u see maxed ppl will say its P2W so it don't even matter.
---
that defense is just penny with extra steps
---
I like healing shade but the revealing your location in a bush is kinda bad.
---
Bibi attack bafed....
---
r/brawlrecruit
---
You should look at the rules of this sub
---
how do u do the small text, i know the big one
---
Probably for the 1st anniversary of global launch
---
*oh no he's hot*
---
My situation is the first panel but the dot is green
---
‚úåÔ∏èü•≥‚úåÔ∏è good luck
---
Thanks
---
Piper: FINALLY! A WORTHY OPPONENT!
---
There are 2 barley skins in your post which you can't buy (the default skin and the wizard barley skin)
---
My God rate is 0.0000000000000000019%

zfw no big titty shaky princess gf

I thought that red thing is his tounge

When you go online and witness 40K paragraphs worth of hentai about yourself.

---
Fastest one I have seen (in a real game) is 23 seconds thougj
---
But lets say Dynamike doesn't have his tnt, how is he still considered fire?
---
anyone know when this is in effect
---
üëå
---
After 10 seconds he start using the Mortis VA
---
‚ù§Ô∏è

Repost bot only works on images, I think
---
Hold up it was TEN seconds??
---
I cannot install cod mobile, it is not compatible with my phone. but I don't think the mobile cod is very good
---
While it took you months, she was my first brawler
---
The deer are pooping happily and i clean it up with a smile, i love animals, i also have a chipmunk in my front yard now.
---
Wow very well done!
---
Thats my B-day XD, Darryl was one of my first max brawlers as well OwO
---
Jessie is going to have almost the same bullet speed as brocks or Penny's? I'ma commit endgame then.
---
But instead you see a beach ball
---
Buuuuff leeeon
---
Why the Golden tooth? Still looks good though.
---
I like this,it proves that showdown is the most hectic gamemode
---
Who doesn‚Äôt love Christmas balls?
---
:CC what were the chances
---
Wow
---
Sure i agree. My intention was definitely not to max my account this fast, it kind of just accidentally happened because i was expecting it to still take years(my experience of 4 years of clash royale where i used the same principle and am still not maxed). 
---
Usually it takes like 40 years to max an account for F2P players with SC games(with the economy they use at release, then they start making leveling easier when they start to lose players).
---
This is kind of reason for this post, i‚Äôm surprised and disappointed that i reached all these goals this fast and now i can‚Äôt help but think that i probably should not have bought those offers since i ended up fast forwarding lot of the fun stuff when my intention was just to skip some of the boring grind.
---
Bad math, u/brawlstars
---
Nobody cares, also, gene is a mythic, not a legy
---
Leon is balanced though
---
Thx
---
FIRE
---
At least it looks right
---
But teaming Mortis isn‚Äôt annoying to go up against whereas dynas....
---
Ultra: Execution
---
Star Power: Communism
---
**Cactus**
---
True man XD 
---
He is our friend in real life :)
---
Alright jumbo
---
Nnnnnn
---
Yoooo
---
Idk hope so
---
Jessie never dished out enough damage, can only solo throwers if barely. The 10% is not enough, she needs more damage per hit. Her attacks are one of the hardest to land in the game and for little reward at that
---
idk why you people think it's a repost,yes it has been done before and no it isn't a complete repost
---
No it‚Äôs real bug
---
Nope. This is a real bug.
---
Except I'm up to 20 upgrades .-.
---
XD true
---
And while they‚Äôre at it, make its range infinite
---
Aww thx, cashless kid awesome
---
BOOOO stop faking
