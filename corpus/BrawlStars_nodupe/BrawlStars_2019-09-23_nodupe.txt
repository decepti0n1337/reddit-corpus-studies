\#WELL PLAYED
---
---
---
heehee hi doe ;)
---
Incredible job
---
That ruins the point of 'solo modes'
---
Its the cycle of life
---
YES! This is my favorite skin and brawler so I get hyped when I see these fan-arts. Extremely well made. I‚Äôm saving this!
---
Exactly, people just throw away the match because they have a Mortis/Tick on their team. Instead of giving them a chance
---
Ikr, I want it so bad
---
C O P Y R I G H T S T R I K E
---
But i didn't face such situation before uptade and to be true i mostly play with my teammates who have lower trophy as well but i never faced such a terrible matchmaking before the update and because of this problem i have already tilted more than 100 trophies but i managed to recover it by playing duos and events like takedown and lonestar.
---
When that one guy decides to ruin his own chances of winning by making your life a living hell. BIG BRAIN
---
The problem is most people don't use tick correctly.
---
you use tick...
---

---
press (Y) to Shame.
---
Lol mb have a good day sir üòÇ
---
She also has a heart pin on her leather jacket, or at least her artwork did
---
That would be, as the name implies, madness.
---
How is it possible to get that many trophies and not have all the brawlers? I'm at 5500 and I just need 2 legendaries and 3 mystics, (and 8 bit)
---
If in doubt:
---
Eheheheheheheheh
---
Really like the idea
---
Doctor: 10k damage piper can hurt you she doesn‚Äôt exist
---
him**
---
Why are people still calling him as a female---
---
well thats why solo exists
---
whyd you post this 4 times
---
But at one point everyone on one team will be too powerful for the other to even have a chance.
---
r/foundthemobileuser
---
Tbh I'm fed up of this I'm done with brawl stars I'm 14k with 2 legends I'm so angry and jealous nope nope nope I'm done I'm deleting this game well not delete it I don't want to play anymore I'm done I have 2 legends but not Leon and sandy wtf
---
Sorry
---
Well its nice but if u use it on an already existing offer.. Skins are gonna cost nothing, it also loses its value. Kinda
---
I know the dude missed like 2 shots the entire game
---
Piper is widowmaker confirmed
---
That's part of my frame! I feel honored!
---
He knows, he‚Äôs talking about how the commenter said all starter characters are brain dead, and colt is a starter character
---
https://youtu.be/xjHdJJxU2M0 10:00
---
He's trash
---
This is going to give me nightmares
---
Maybe stop playing bull in showdown, he‚Äôs not even that good in it at higher levels
---
This feels like an action movie, where everything, despite ridiculous odds, lines up perfectly. Except this was able to actually happen using skill.
---
I agree with you but still login to claim daily rewards
---
Deepest apologies
---
I also do this but the thing was I tried destroying the one skull and it didn't break
---
i hope you come back soon tho
---
Wow this is useful! Also if u wanna join my new sub r/insanetrickshots I‚Äôll give u mod in the next few mins
---
dang man my primo is lvl 7 and only rank 19
---
Are you aware that skateboard wheels can't pop?
---
Oh ya I forgot it‚Äôs level 1
---
It would be better if the grass didn't have the gaps.

That's called Big Game, it's already in the game, check your info before your 7th birthday and post something relevant, not plagiarism
---
You picked the most god awful music for this
---
The sex number
---
Oh. My bad. I guess they patched it because you could go to like 146 or smthn and it would crash
---
ikr. whenever there is a legendary post, 90% of the comments are complaining about not getting a legendary
---
Worth hearing about though
---
GET THIS SHIT TO HOT RN
---
I‚Äôm just saying you cropped it out so we can‚Äôt see it photoshopped and that‚Äôs not a cool thing to do.
---
i'm listening to megalovania as i read this post
---
It really be like that sometimes.
---
so cute!!
---
Thanks
---
Point is it is meant to be a solo game mode
---
It's still pretty impressive. People saying that trophies are easy to get now are all just heavy gemmers or just dumb :/
---
A W Y E A H T U R N I N U P T H E B O O M B O X

When I use my own credit card

This is ditto PUBG Infection mode üòÇüòÇ
---
This would be a good idea for a type of club wars
---
[removed]
---
I think it's very cute. Made me smile.
---
Not arguing, im just saying that those things is annoying to play against. Yeah its luck and thats actually why this mode is irritating to play.
---
Ohhh yeah that's strange haha
---
Well I‚Äôm gonna ask how
---
is your in game name jelf .
---
Really? Then go ahead and kill him... please
---
Wrong subreddit
---
That would have been so funny if OP said that xD xD
---
Am i only one who think brock icon is true devil.
---
I'm glad we're have a realistic person here. So many people were gonna go in and be like "iT nOt WoRkInG"
---
Because he s open?
---
That‚Äôs what my mom said when I was born
---
Nice aiming skills ;P

Sadly they aren‚Äôt family

I don't know this is not my project i found it in a video that posted by brawl stars
---
Normally I would call you toxic for that but because you did it so well and took it so far, that was a beautiful performance
---
how
---
I rlly like this idea, plus it basically forces people to either sit still and take the hit from enemies or to move and take the hit from the bone
---
I wish i(brock)  had some one to care to. But no one ship me üòë
---
How did you met Lex
---
Unfortunately yes. I can't believe this made it in '-'
---
Ohh. Can you link the video?
---
So close to frame 69
---
This is literally my idea for a tanky Lobber but lava instead of Cyrstal
---
wait, why "unfortunately"?
---
I‚Äôm thinking since he stubs enemies‚Äîhis range can be that long
---
That‚Äôs pretty cool 
---
It‚Äôs Ameratasu in human form and normal form with ameratasu being cool in the Capcom universe
---
My primo is 7 at 554 and i killed myself to reach that. Nice job dude.
---
Spinel‚Äôs origin is soo sad, it makes me want to punch rose
---
I found showdown so stupid after Lone Star and Takedown modes got released.
---
Bruh
---
To bad.
---
THANKS!
---
480\*29
---
plus the bonus 100,200,300,400,500.600 if you make it that far which is 2100\*29 which is 60,900 star points for all the brawlers. 13920 with all the 1400+ brawlers.
---
When she texts you 
---
"Babe Im Horny"
---
Would have been better
---
Nope...
---
Congrats. But now is only the beginning. Disregard anyone who says something like ‚Äúit doesn‚Äôt matter anymore‚Äù because they are wrong. Be proud of yourself and get ready to push even higher.
---
Makes sense
---
Does op stand for original post
---
you make me sad
---
I love it ü•∞
---
Cool keep going, not a worthy post but you keep doing it :)
---
Some people just wanna watch the world burn
---
It would be an automatic 10 v the bot if you only saw dynamikes.
---
I saw 3 teaming dyna's today
---
HOW?!
---
brock is love, brock is life.
---
Me just waiting for the invite to expire :(
---
it's completely unbalanced.  powerups should spawn way less and there should be a limit on how many powercubes one can have.
---
F in the chat I‚Äôm at 13k with no legendarys
---
This madlad
---
KonichiWHACK
---
Thats why i dont use short range brawlers. Pam is the best pick because of her high burst damage
---
as a mortis i use the same game. Brawl ball gank shots. same idea but actual skill and not being a degenerate
---
At least you have a legendary
---
Oh god oh frick
---
Ah yis
---
you will be maxed eventually but you will never be able to buy skins without gems/star points.
---
# I'm already excited to start drawing! &gt;v&lt;
---
Piper (even if I don‚Äôt ship them the most): Oh sweetie!
---
Nothing makes me more angry than someone putting down someone else‚Äôs accomplishments. Wow man, you finally got to 3K? Congrats man. Well done.
---
And why did you add that totally unrelated picture?
---
Would you like me to DM you a video?
---
wow thank you so much!
---
Damn, you became a bigger threat than the bot itself
---
He seems a little OP. I don't wanna be harsh (since my Brawler idea got a lot of hate), but him being able to destroy cover so much will make Brawl Ball short lived. 
---
Also, both star powers are OP. 
---
I think every aspect need a slight nerf except his HP and range
---
What?
---
lmao
---
biggest collab I have joined yet
---
pootis
---
Hmmm yes I speak blind
---
Man thanks for the advice... now I understand better.
---
Artists' dream collab &lt;3
---
Yup
---
gotta scroll 9 hours of posts to check
---
Now that‚Äôs the real question
---
Perfectly balanced as all things should be.
---
Complaints smh my head

You're an idiot leon is amazing

Really? I feel like I can consistently get 2nd-5th unless those power cube loaded pipers start stalking me.

That's overrated üòÇüòÇ

IF that modifier is present,which is once a week.

Congratulations!

Ah gotcha. What do you have crow and frank at?

Even though I can‚Äôt draw, I‚Äôm still hyped for this.
---
I‚Äôm more of a Crig person myself

I know it's my first time and plus I don't know how to create a cool fan art ik in mobile BTW

Thanks for answering!

Creeper...
---
Area 51 Raiders: They can‚Äôt stop us all.
---
Piper: *exists* 
---
Oh so this is the reason Area51 raiding failed
---
Thanks for compiling them here! They make great profile pictures.
---
More like eve map in showdown
---
no I'm just saying you will probably need further proof for supercell
---
Bruh i was playing leon and he 3 shot me in seconds. Before i knew he charged his 4th shot
---
Crow is adorable
---
Amazing idea for skin
---
Lol, I‚Äôve got 106
---
Oh for god sake, SCP 049 RETURN IN THE CONTAINMENT CHAMBER NOW.
---
Leader of OPs haha
---
Leon is amazing and IN MY OPINION his super is better than Sandy's
---
M-maybe xD
---
Apparently, it didn't work too well xDD
---
Because you can't reach 6000? üòÇ (Don't get too offended)
---
Others brawlers : "Oh Oh, when come as close as you like... Wait, no, NO !!!"
---
No I‚Äôm not offended that‚Äôs so true XD
---
Yah U
---
I have all epics and mortis but still no legendary.
---
Oh well i know that i have high ranked brawlers and i should not write this but writing it.
---
That's an amazing way to reply to my comment üòÇ don't worry you'll reach him :)
---
I had that while making a heart with gene supers... I was almost there!!!!!
---
You did well in 3 months, it took me since global
---
Where in the game are these icons besides the trophy road brawlers?
---
Rico be like: [Œ∏]
---
Well I‚Äôm actually 300 trophies a way
---
Thats legit misdirecting the enemy team
---
Wow
---
Then it's already yours, don't worry uwu he will be fun to play and you know it's worth it
---
He‚Äôs on showdown so prob that or brawl ball. Either way do brawl ball, it‚Äôs his best map and showdown after 500 starts getting aids
---
Took me a minute to get it but trueü§£ü§£
---
You need to go on the desktop version of reddit and search for flairs
---
Look it up on google "flairs"
---
458 trophy power 10 lmao
---
Kairos: Eating rocks till I get Rox

Seems interesting, I‚Äôll be keeping up with it

REEEEE IT LOOKS AWESOME ;w; I LOVE IT!

Absolutely Adorable! Love your art! :3

You asked for everyones opinion when you postet you list. Expect people on reddit to post their opinions

Thank you for giving me permission to redraw your beautiful skin (*ÀòÔ∏∂Àò*).ÔΩ°.:*‚ô°

Since when lmao
---
you missed the huge opportunity to use the word brawlloween
---
No,it's real,just for fun!üòâ
---
Oh no...
---
'Early Players Get Senior',Then why isn't the No 1 Person in your clan Senior?
---
The buff and rework I would give him is: 
---
Faster Reload Speed, like Nita, Rico, Colt, etc
---
6440 HP at max level and 1400 damage at max too
---
And putting him invincible in his dash.
---
I love when 6 years old are spitting straight fax
---
Exactly. I have power 7 mortis as 650 and this guy with power 8 at 570 thinks hes good lmao
---
Wow I thought people loved fortnite
---
you want skin or not
---
Aint no pro at 500. Thats casual play
---
Well i mean the game was in beta before.
---
Patients, I got Crow at 10k+too
---
Nice!
---
Also, if you want, I can make a list of what you can change. ( there‚Äôs not much cuz this is epic )
---
Example: colt‚Äôs extended mag can be buffed/changed, since 420 extra dmg isn‚Äôt much. Maybe a wider area of Attack?
---
good in Lonestar, Gem Grab, Solo/Duo Showdown, Takedown, and Siege pretty much useless everywhere else
---
Sue them if they don‚Äôt give.
---
Welcome :)
---
Bruhhhhh.I have 9000 and have 2 legendaries.
---
You should have tagged me! XD  
---
Solved! :)
---
YOU BET IM GONNA GET GEMS IF POSSIBLE! Or maybe not...all i want is to contribute to thia game and community :3
---
Gems be good too...
---
I d like to see her from the back.if u know what im saying
---
Play in sd
---
Zeus.....is a stickman
---
Hahaha, easy there, Mr. Law XD
---
motherfuckt
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
stupid
---
Well ofc! I'm glad a crow saying Spike is op. Consider Spike being the best legendary after sandy's nerf. Thank you for your cute Spike play.
---
And then when you thought you completely finished the game ! Poof ! The season ends and totally fucks you
---
So,
---
Frank's: Super-Strengh: If any Frank's Super hit his allies, they will get a 30% buff of damage for 5 seconds.
---
Poco's: Mucho Loco!: Poco's Super, if hit an enemy, makes they became paralyzed for 3 seconds.
---
Spike's: Spiky Friend: Spike's Super can now heal Spike's allies (300 each second) but can't heal him. (Or her, Spike don't have genre)
---
What do you think?
---
I havr only 15 gems now.poor me
---
Then there‚Äôs me with my highest brawler rank 21
---
Not a big deal,but nice meme
---
I ordered a salad sandwich...
---
I‚Äôm not. I do not own any of these two subreddits.
---
I feel sorry for you... ü§Ø
---
My boi crow always rocking üòç
---
Just play for fun, and stop focusing on the other aspects of the game (I only play bb with 3-4 brawlers)
---
I care
---
Now that's a lot of PATIENCE !!!
---
Spike when spike/throws super sprout thorns which do not allow to move to the enemy .Sandy angrily throws super when it or its allies come back, then they have 40% faster returns health
---
I dont even have a mystic brawler :O
---
Greatest idea? Arrogant kid. This star power sucks.
---
Leon is good in lonestar
---
suddenly become 0iq, why not
---
yea lol
---
if the primo didn't jump we probably would've lost
---
Never spin.
---
Star power: The Boss - Megelovania starts playing if Sans is below 30% HP.
---
If you care keep it to yourself. No one asked to you show your 550 trophy Leon lol. You are at 7k trophies too, just shut up already.
---
‚ÄúNo, I can do it! No, I can do it! Omg why didn‚Äôt this idiot raven help me‚Äù - Piper
---
‚ÄúHm, I can jump and kill him... HMMM‚Äù
---
How'd u get these
---
The need for report button is strong
---
Stop trying to only play with a couple of brawler. Actually try push the other ones and you'll find its fun and one of them might even become your new favourite.
---
Shop resets at 10:00 am GBT
---
Your game is almost crush at that point
---
Same to me
---
Removed - DO NOT SUBMIT POSTS WITH TITLES IN ALL CAPS. CAPS LOCK IS CRUISE CONTROL FOR COOL
---
Soo... me
---
It's OP no matter what, reducing damage won't change it. Would definitely break the game.
---
This is art collaboration project of the artists using this sub reddit, and it is great idea, but not update by Supercell. Dani is just being nice and advertising it in his twitter account. 
---
Off course this doesn't mean that there couldn't also be an update coming from Supercell regarding Halloween.
---
But the loaded Rico
---
No this is my brother null's brawl account
---
I loved your mortis video too haha.
---
i hope they will make mortis shine in this event
---
What do you mean?

congrats, you used a emote without cringy

If this is a repost then link it

Brawl talks are developer videos showcasing their content. Your thinking of community round tables.

Play a solo SD in Arabic. Win or lose.

Change back to English.

Open 9 small boxes.

Tap on every brawler (Even locked).
---
Open Big/Mega box.

NEW BRAWLER OR STAR POWER

It‚Äôs called season reset?

Once I played solo showdown and It was a 15 seconds game
---
Well hiders are already the team
---
Well guess ill push my shelly to 1k

Best thing I've seen on this sub in a long time. A group of fans with talent coming together to celebrate something. No complaining, no begging for upvotes, no half-assed repost, no shitty joke told for the fifth time, no shaking.
---
This is beautiful.
---
Does it works lol?
---
He‚Äôs likely maxed out. I‚Äôve seen the guy post on here before, and he had around 4K boxes before glottal if I remember correctly. Dudes a mad man lol
---
I grinded after the reset
---
Yes
---
Well I got Gene, Power throw, Shell shock, Darryl and Rico. Friends got Tara and Leon. So probaly
---
I bet that was really unexpected.

I wasn‚Äôt really counting on getting Sandy any time soon, glad I was wrong.

150 gems is WAY cheaper than 69 gems.

I'm currently at 16.5k, with a record of 18k and I'm STILL and STILL playing with 6k-12k with an absolute trash game sens. The matchmaking really needs a change.
---
Well it's not like he would ever need to open them all. He only needs to open as many as necessary to max whatever they add to the game.
---
Really cool animation!

uh

Hello :)

Thank you,Poco!)
---
This is a great cosplay! If you're looking for advice, I have a suggestion.
---
Its aesthetically perfect. The only thing about it is that Penny is a pirate brawler. She has the mischievous smile, and although she looks weak her personality is tough. Your expression is probably whats making u/Raif123 uncomfortable. You look like Penny, but you also look naive. Maybe try getting into character by posing like Penny, and trying to imitate her facial expressions.
---
tldr: Your costume is perfect aesthetcally. Its getting into character thats the problem. Penny has a tough personality. But in the picture, you look naive. Try imitating Penny's personality.
---
Pls don't take it the wrong way. Not trying to be rude. Good luck :)

Mortis - (‡ºé‡∫∂ ‡∑¥ ‡ºé‡∫∂)
---
wow bo is super op wtf
---
thats not just a line, is the actual ball hitbox. The game is very different in those conditions
---
Is that what they are going to call the next update as? Nice
---
Now even talking to u noob
---
I tried to get the token with Gene and got spawn camped the whole time. Then I took Shelly and got second.
---
piper is one of the best brawler in lone star mode right now
---
Why next year? We still have time right?
---
Hmmm... that's a cool idea, like a cowboy that made himself look like a dragon warrior, because he could forge weapons and armor from magma
---
How do you know she won?
---
Tara's shadow died too fast üò©
---
Don‚Äôt  know if this is a question but I would like to see Lil‚Äô Kairos versus Lady Kairos in practice modeüòÇ, besides that keep up the great content and look forward to your future videos!
---
Thanks &lt;3
---
He gonna spank u
---
Now it's normal, because the star powers doesn't affect that much
---
but it's cool!)
---
Dang ariel looks angry üòÆ
---
Thank you for the feedback!
---
Imma spank you
---
only island invasion map. shelly is not very good for lone star mode. you can watch the new video from coach cory's YouTube channel :/
---
Thank you so much ‚ô•Ô∏è
---
Sorry, what‚Äôs so funny?
---
Aww,thank you so muchüñ§
---
You should watch kairostime, he will let you know about any changes to the game, this feature was added since global or maybe since ios beta, either ways it's been there for a while and kairostime said it in one of his videos.
---
Can you give me an example (I don't know English enough, I am very sorry about that)
---
Spank bang
---
Me too but really no one cares if you will Uninstall the game because tgere are millions of players other than you(my only legendary is spike too)
---
Why pink piper? Should have gone with blue :/
---
Ahah, okayüòÇ
---
Where 8-bit
---
I honestly don't know.
---
He/She removed the watermark,he/she also didn't credit,He/She added his/her own watermark(I think)
---
??? You're literally asking for a free discount on cosmetic items
---
Oh ok sorry for accusing you. Can I get a link to your insta?
---
Oh...k
---
No
---
I wANt MoRe LeGendaRiEs.
---
Wait are you serious? The post that guy made is different than OPs. And OP even credited him anyway.
---
Bruh, you serious?
---
Attack: **SPONK**
---
SUPER: **SPANKO**
---
You created trA
---
Take OJ's power tool for it
---
What else does high trophies mean?
---
Is primo sp actually 10000
---
He found gems in every box
---
Star Power 1 Blue eye:after use the super he can use main attack blue bones and dogge much faster for 15 seconds (have a bar after charged √Æn 1.5 seconds dogge next attack) 
---
Star Power 2 Last attack : he summon a charge of gaster blasters around him after 40% low healt but have a bar this is full charged every 30 seconds (every blaster can Block any attack and give stun to enemy)
---
Your aim is crazy good
---
Where is 8-bit???
---
Don't fall for this,his English is also not good as you can tell
---
Our trophy rods look similar.
---
Star Power 1 Blue eye:after use the super he can use main attack blue bones and dogge much faster for 15 seconds (have a bar after charged √Æn 1.5 seconds dogge next attack) he need 6 complete attacks to charge the super again
---
Star Power 2 Last attack : he summon a charge of gaster blasters around him after 40% low healt but have a bar this is full charged every 30 seconds (every blaster can Block any attack and give stun to enemy for 6 seconds) radius 10 Meters. Can't destroy walls
---
Me too, I have 13k and I don't have legendaries.
---
Who won?
---
u/sofaestofado has a post named spike (Can‚Äôt Link cuz mobile), might not be the same image, but pretty much same content. So totally original I wouldn‚Äôt say so...
---
I swear this sub doesn't understand reddit. Reposting isn't against reddiquette so it isn't reportable. Reporting someone for reposting just wastes mod time. Also OP took an idea and improved upon it. This isn't a repost.

Okay üòà

I have never played fortinte. Obviously you are 11 years old, "tsk tsk tsk", the joke about not being born, too childish and immature, ah, kids these days are so disrespectful.
---
Lol happened to me too... But with a mythic
---
Oh that's lucky
---
?
---
Judging from your grammar, I think you're one of them too.
---
Ok, we get it. But if you win 3v3 battle, than the losing team are going to be sad too, right? Why not lose on purpose in 3v3 then? The objective of this game mode is to deal more damage than the others. And other players can't deal damage if they are dead.
---
I have everything above 500 so I don't have a reason to play anymore
---
Fake Gedi-KOR
---
Oh I didn't see the op I just saw the pic cus I accidentally exit from reddit
---
Where is 8-bit
---
That you are skilled and have been played a lot? Well I am a bit skilled but i took a break for 2 months
---
It‚Äôs like they want us to hate the mode.
---
The point of takedown is to deal more damage, then others. And others can't deal damage if they are dead. Everything is by rules.
---
U do there are new ranks üòë
---
Star power: every 20 seconds he takes no damage
---
Nice cosplay :)
---
Person?
---
It is stolen
---
The sides are good but the mid..... SHELLY HABITAT
---
It‚Äôs only your fault if you took a huge break. Trophies is an indicator of how much a player played on his account meaning that a low trophy player didn‚Äôt played that much, if you play a lot you‚Äôre most likely to get a legendary. So instead of crying because you don‚Äôt have a legendary I suggest you actually stop complaining and blaming it on unfairness even if it‚Äôs fair and try harder to get one.
---
ill nerf t
---
Look at u/Yopppyyyy ‚Äòs post, then look at this one. They are **not** the same! If you really think that this is still a repost, then I think you should learn what a ***meme*** is

Wait you‚Äôre the guy who kept promoting your club in our club

Buy 150 of corseüëåüòÇ

i know that

Good

OK and I know what a meme is

How is it copy paste? The person talks about her expression and penny. Did you even read what they wrote
---
r/wooosh
---
Lol
---
Oof
---
Its sad the damn starting brawlers are the go-to for an easy win
---
When you try to be funny but you are not at all and even sound stupid. Also learn grammar, they don't teach you that in primary school?
---
Skin 2 Win
---
Maybe the Octomber uptade brawler is gonna be a zombie ,witch or something like that? THAT would be cool
---
Very cool!

Actually i mean it to be stupid hahaa omfg!!1!1!

Now I‚Äôm starting to see some creepy furry things with Sandy...
---
Wa bwa bwa bwaaa bwa
---
Amazing idea, hope supercell add them, keep it up the best quality content, all I have to say is Nice.
---
To let the community shiw if they liked or disliked this video
---
It also REALLY pisses me off that you can play Gem Grab and Brawl Ball with the full width of the new screens but in Showdown and Siege they crop it and give you fucking black bars again.  I just upgraded and it blows.
---
She is 12-16 year's old. That means you get arrested Sir.
---
Who tf cares
---
Oops
---
Thanks! :)
---
Np
---
#WA?
---
Is there a list somewhere of how star points work now?
---
Why blur the name and tag? Also wheres the proof he doesnt have a legendary?
---
With a box like this I needed to flex.
---
Bull and bush
---
Ohh, thanks :)
---
aww too bad

Rip old barley

Yeah, some of them are already in Instagram, but they'll be here
---
Are there any rewards?
---
Both a big box (500 SP) and a mega box (1500 SP). They should be available now in the store.
---
How is your legend chance even high mine is 0.22
---
It‚Äôs ok if I do it on paper and post ( and send you the link ) or I‚Äôll type it?
---
Then what the fuck they upload their vids after 1 minute the brawl talk is released

lol this happened to me as well, a shelly missed a super shot lol
---
*dare oposse me mortal*
---
How much trophies do you have?
---
550*
---
r/MortisGang in a nutshell
---
That sub should just cease to exist
---
This with el fuego star power would be complete
---
Seriously? You're only 300 trophies with starpower? Nice job spending money and ranting about others who are at the same rank as you, with a power disadvantage.
---
No one in class don't interesting in it, so when i play with my friend, a lot of 10 years kids go to us and start say: "How many trophies you have?", "I have 5 legendarys", "I have 1000000000 trophies". Pls, stop
---
Just get everyone to 500 it‚Äôs not THAT hard
---
Imagine a nine y/o in 9th grade...
---
Soooooooooo balanced man!!!!
---
Fany nander AHAHAHHHHAHAHHAHAHAHHHH
---
This isnt the first op brawler.
---
And can we get some kind of reward for getting kills? Like xp or some gold?
---
Frike the Monkey
---
either way, if you connect to supercell id or not, your legendary chance won't drop when you unlock a rare. So you really shouldn't call then "dumb"
---
That would make it P2W which supercell is very against
---
At 8k?
---
Not my proudest fapü§í
---
I'm not 9! I'm 15
---
Where can I find this ungrateful piece of rat fecies?
---
Man that‚Äôs so confusing, everywhere I see people commenting that their probabilities change with 10, 30 boxes or less than 100
---
Meanwhile i got 3 event tickets
---
Yea
---
I just need all the legendaries
---
10 mega boxes = legendary
---
#seems broken
---
Ready to listen all your criticism
---
*Mortisisstilltrash*
---
They weren't even teaming but nice
---
oh yes Spank me harder
---
I did that frame on pixel art theres a confusiong on the title i will change it
---
Is it nothing or is it alot of gems
---
I will declare the start of the nice chain
---
Yea becous theres totaly not a brawler name bull
---
This is awesome
---
They were i can post the part were they spin
---
Yeah supercell found the name bull
---
r/brawlrecruit
---
I like your concepts, its look like from supercellüëç
---
They were teaming at first but then they betrayed each other
---
You have made tra
---
Ah shit... Here we go again!
---
You can literally go through walls! You can dodge his shots at close range and just reload normal shots
---
Oh frick it's frick
---
Yes, first one was taken on Saturday.
---
The second one 2 hours before the event ended.
---
Yeah true
---
Ok but its better than now
---
I didn't even know he existed, but thank you for enlightenmentinizing me
---
I become Leon in the school to üòÇ

Tara is OP I got 18 rank on She/He BTW Tara us men or women?
---
Very.good!
---
I made something very similar to this looks great
---
Nice.
---
No problem. I also have some other lit fusions
---
üòÇ BTW, do you plan to do more cosplays? ü§î
---
Yes!
---
Well theres not really a reason to open up the boxes once you maxed out, so you would just save them for when like a new brawler is released since coins are pretty much useless when you maxed out, and you don‚Äôt have any power points to get anymore.
---
k.
---
Lads she‚Äôs 15 bewarned
---
Pretty cool dawg
---
What a bot lmao.
---
Yeah i know and what does this have to do with you not understanding the joke
---
And what do you plan for the next one? I would really like to see a Jessie one üòÅ
---
i just got frank today soooo
---
Very good :D
---
Who do y'all thinks is the cutest?
---
Remember buff Carl,Gene,Crow, and nerf Rosa, Leon 
---
Or rework piper icon ?
---
Idk about ya , it‚Äôs a funny meme and a huge won 
---
Especially Mortis needs a buff 
---
And what‚Äôs a better way than #MMGA 
---
If u want to be involved 
---
This image or any image u creat or a video a gif a meme anything 
---
On r/brawlstars 
---
Raid starts 
---
Sep.25 5 pm est

Good luck creature of the night

It should include #MMGA or #buffmortis
---
Now. That a lot of damage
---
Just clipart but thanks lol
---
I like how they included the bubblegum lol. Very nice!
---
Thank
---
I also have crow and I am F2P
---
Thank you, didn‚Äôt know that!
---
Not compared to Dina's Demolition, which is a ranged attack with a decent radius.
---
Lol perfection
---
In other words they are fucking stupid
---
Idk ask supercellüòÇüòÇ
---
Only managed to do something like that with crow. I usually get bored quickly aswell.
---
COOOOOOME GET IT (\¬∞^¬∞/)
---
This doesn't even make sense but that wouldn't work, just play siege, which is already in the game and use wizard thinking your a cool fucking little shit playing clash royale when your actual account is still in the goblin arena with the 2 year badge dumb ass, get a life and colt in brawl stars, you really need him to understand how important skill, something which you have a complete lack of, is.
---
Yeah ive seen a meme like this like 5 times this week
---
why can't you just let him be special
---
what were the ods (1 day 5 chests - 2 big 2 small 1 mega) bibi fell out of the small chest and then after the % reset on epic brawlers i got a noter epic from the mega box id literally gotten 4 epic in a row T_T (such lucky and unlucky outcome at the same time)
---
It‚Äôs just to sub and like u think ur gonna get crow, spike and Leon guess what I have 3 of them shit I forgot Sandy.
---
BIG TIME
---
My class only plays that pubg bullshir
---
Thank you for this. Have this skin since it was released
---
Please abandon your account and wait a short 7 years until your thirteen and have some logic and don't continuously shit post and do nothing else
---
Excellent Mortis technique!
---
So he is basically saying...pls fix this, I got a legendary instead of super rare, this has to be FIXED!
---
My god, what is wrong with these kids
---
I mean what else would you do with star points

Please Give Me Thumbs Up Below Coments because 1 hour 30 minutes.

I know a guy at 12k with no mortis or any legandaries

W a r n i n g !
---
This is a test where youre NOT allowed to shake. If you shake, you are disqualified. So the rules are simple.
---
D O N T   S H A K E ! ! !
---
Probably because your trophies are still in the double digits, complain when your trophy level has 5 digits, which is 10000 so you don't sprain that poor six yet old brain of yours, and you don't have any other legendary
---
If he‚Äôs buffed he‚Äôs going to be op. Let mortis live imo
---
I hope you get her soon. She is so much fun to play, but she does require good skill to play. For example you cant play aggro with her until you have your super.
---
Tank
---
Whats the atomic mass?
---
When robo rumble had a one month break
---
Mortis voice lines are awesome tho
---
It is an ad... in a way :) it is my way of telling you I will be posting my new how-to-draw tutorial on how to draw Iris Tara soon
---
Yeah but still people will complain about the spam as they do in the yt comments because everyone is still complaining even though their comments mean almost nothing
---
Wtf...this is even more cursed than spank, di-ck and fock...
---
El rudo is a lot cheaper it would not be fair
---
lol
---
That‚Äôs a scam‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs your luck it doesn‚Äôt work ‚Ä¶
---

---
Match making doesn‚Äôt account for power level, only trophy level, which is still a little off, but it happens
---
Looks really great! I like the hat a lot, great job. I would love to see more cosplay, keep up the great the work! I‚Äôm here to support you!
---
10.5k trophies w/ 4 legendaries? and you‚Äôre complaining?

1. Shelly e4 Boss e5

2. Bull e2!!

you can't compare them if it isn't for mobile

Yes but nazis sucked at their job lol

No, auto aim is the reason they got nerfed (after the landscape update)
---
Portrait mode or Landscape im still a god close range manual aimer but now any average joe can have the aimbot for aim like a pro bull... sad
---
I never auto aim at any range any brawler just to protest that disgusting thing and Im still a 1k primo and bull üòò

This looks really nice! Please do El Rudo too plss.
---
Wow a el primo joke, this is so funny, i would give u an award if i h√¢d money
---
damn that's really good. Supercell seriously needs to take notice for like El Rey and like pirate Gene kinda mad there no affects for those sound good job man
---
Ummmm.....isn't the bottom right word a racial slur.  Like using the n-word with hard er?
---
But manually aiming will lead to massive delay
---
when you try to make a shitpost but then it gets too real
---
Cool

That won‚Äôt work against Sandys with Starpower

he probably lagged, he clearing isnt throwing on purpose, if he was, he wouldve took the ball and throw in own goal 2 times in a row
---
Not as good as a legendary
---
What is the best mode for jessie
---
How? You cant even get 158 as rico
---
Dude it‚Äôs also partially luck.  You don‚Äôt get away with 96 hp and call it skill.
---
Good and honest lovin' is overrated. Play the field/map while you still can. Get into every lane and shoot your rockets indiscriminately. You can settle down when you get arthritis in your thumbs.
---
Just reached 10k
---
You‚Äôre under 6k, and have all mythics and lower?

And you ‚Äúknow the pain‚Äù

I'm at 8.3k and I've never been in Tribe Ferocity because of this. I only heard of the club until now. You're probably thinking of someone else.

Not if their ‚Äúaccomplishments‚Äù aren‚Äôt even accomplishments.

I dunno, that dubstep is pretty convincing

whats your lowest brawler
---
but still %100 TRIGGERED

8-bit cause I just find him sooooo boring

how many trophies?

Sorry my bad I also have a friend called OOF Oofington so I thought this is you

It's like manually aiming Shelly's attack in island invasion, you are only hindering yourself 10 fold

Lucky

cause the bear is too fat and it is stuck in the GUI

It would be nice if it shows up in your shop soon.
---
Pls do that supercell

Nice original context

You have a legendary!?

Technically it is, but not with the K.

What is your least favorite brawler? Mine is tick

Edit: no offense to those tick players

Ok :3

*Bull sad noise*

why is your mini account better than my main account?
