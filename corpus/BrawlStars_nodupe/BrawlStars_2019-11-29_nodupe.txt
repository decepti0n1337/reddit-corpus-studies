Mine is bugged where the taps register up and left of the actual tap and this only happens in brawlstars even after reinstalling on an unlocked Razer phone 2

Edit: it was cus I had the game set to 1080p in the game preset while the phone was still on 1440p

Please elaborate

Plz bro i only need  2 days

...how many trophies do you have and do you comment this on literally every trophy-related comment
---
Very XD! Epic family guy gamer moment!
---
I knew that art style looked familiar...
---
I can buy one right now but I don't really play Bo or Crow enough to want a nice skin for them. Plus, I'm hoping they'll release a new 50,000 star point skin soon.
---
Cute!

Well at least youre honest. Happy Thanksgiving friend!

I‚Äôm gonna end this

you gave it to them because there Trophy-worthy(Bull,Brock,Dynamike,etc), Rare, Super Rare, Mythic, Legendary, and of course, Epic.

Legendaries are really overrated. and to think that people will spend about 400 gems to get a new brawler,and then have the audacity to complain about not having/getting star powers

Thx

And who do you play in lone star?
---
It happened to me before too. I think its a glitch where if you were watching brawl tv then quit the app, and rejoin the app and play a match, this would happen. To fix it, just press where the proceed button is and itll bring you to brawl tv, then quit braw tv. :)

Pretty dumb comment considering most players below 600 don't use star power.

Absolute genius.

What's happening with this Chico milk?
---
so that‚Äôs your excuse for not knowing bo‚Äôs star power? Lol it was a joke btw kiddo so take it easy  ü§£
---
To be honest, nobody has any idea as to how to play mortis in brawl ball(IMO). He isnt a goal scorer to me, rather a very opportunistic support brawler, normally just waiting for the players to line up, and then chain supers and act as a distraction while his teammates push the ball up the field
---
Artists, him give him art that he is waiting for!
---
why no?
---
I dont know if your joking or not but just in case you're not he didn't open his mouth because in the original version of that meme the birds mouth is closed.
---
imo hes a mix of goal scorer and support, in that he can dribble very fast, especially with coiled and super (scorer) or can dash to low health brawlers or assist (support).
---
mortis is a great goal scorer if your teammates know how to pass or if the opponent just leaves a side open. he's also the fastest brawler which helps in scoring.
---
for support, I've chained like 3 supers on enemies which allows other teammates to score. he can also kill control brawlers like tick, dyna, emz if played correctly.
---
God bless you
---
You definitely can goal score with him, i was just saying that its way better not to ball hog and just walk around, instead of having an actual presence on the field
---
Have you ever stop to think maybe I‚Äôm a ‚Äúbad random‚Äù just some food for though
---
yeah this is true.
---
*jumps over Shelly super and kills her*
---
True. Besides, pay to win players and people who didn‚Äôt use a brawler until they upgraded it are always there.
---
They‚Äôre all bots.
---
This would be the perfect skin to have in the Chinese New Year update if brawl stars still decides to do it next year. But that is awesome.
---
When crow jumps to me and i kill him avoiding super. 
---
Crow: ^ (look again at the pic)

penny was actually pretty decent, op knew turret placements and generally had control of their lane (except for that one part with bibi)
---
Ye
---
The guy is kinda thicc tho
---
They got Bo to hunt crow LOL
---
Swan Song healed over a BIG radius throught walls whenever Poco died, extremely usefull in gem grab, heist and situational Brawl Ball and bounty, it healed every status effect, and could very well turn the tide of an battle if well coordinated, I think people just didnt knew how to use it well, or it was too complicated (the most complicated thing at the time was bo's mines)

---
please stop making posts like these. they are low effort and ruin the community when the whole feed is just this and choccy milk. it gets tiresome after awhile.
---
yes, i know i made a post like this. but that was a few months ago, when it wasn't a thing and no one had did it. still low effort but at least it wasnt repetitive. now all of these posts are made to farm karma, and its really ruining the subreddit.

Most of them dont have a choice, because its Power Play, so you need a star power. I only had Nitas, so I basically never won, but I just got Pam's today, so I could actually help the team

Remember how people OG. What's worse is if both of your teammates worked together to do that. My teammates were so good, performing very well and scoring the first goal. Then, right b4 we win, the Mortis OG on purpose. 30 seconds b4 we win, the Frank was already just attacking our own goal. Then, in over time, the Mortis "skillfully" dribbles it into our goal, while Frank shoots backwards. It pisses me off so hard. If you are gonna throw the game, at least don't waste my time.

Definitely worth it a legendary when it's not on a discount is usually 600-700 gems and your getting good skin with custom effects,so I think it's worth it

No, the joke is that supercell likes to add brock skins, (the brock skins is the horse) and the leon buff is the hidden troops, the joke is that supercell wouldnt let leon buff enter their "kingdom", but they'd let brock skins enter. Its a trojan horse reference bruh
---
When people say Leon is better than you
---
Stop hiding in bushes
---
Shouldn't need to explain but 5 Mort and 3 leon
---
Ow awesome!! ‚ô°
---
As a piper
---
someone put "Do a barrel roll" (starfox quote) when Darryl use special pls
---
I mean who doesnt RiGhT?!
---
I want number
---
#mistake#
---
Cool
---
Around 100-250
---
I like it!!!
---
I do not enjoy Jessie as a brawler lol but very awesome cosplay!
---
Omg su cute!
---
What
---
Yeah obviously when your a dynamike you are gonna say he is op but just play any other brawler and you will see how easy it is to kill him or play leon if you have and see how much you struggle 
---
I suggest you at least watch a tier list before you talk so you could have a bit of proof thanks :)

Later

You are fucked up

She was added in the game in April. It's too soon for a remodel for her. But I don't think she needs a remodel more then Pam. She looks okay.
---
Awh this is so cute! I love the soft colors
---
Actually it returns if you don't use your other attack after again 2 seconds 
---
An enemy can also bring it back to you if he  dashes or jumps
---
And if you ask, when an enemy is marked by the Ake and he goes in a bush, the actual chain becomes invisible too, so you don't see where the other person is hiding

I got first legendary at 8k

The format made me lmao

Nita, bo, darryl, carl, spike and leon be like:

Something happened?

some of these seem op as hell

and I like that

Yes,its a masterpiece by god of paint.

Exactly

I wonder why?
---
I would think they meant 2 also because 3 seems the farthest from that look.
---
Yeah I've always loved this format, finally found a worthy hero
---
9k is quite a big amount, you know
---
It doesn‚Äôt look that equal
---
If they don't have any power 10 but Shelly then all they have to do is not playing until a good mode for Shelly comes out in rotation. It's so frustrating when you loose because your teammates pick a Shelly in bounty.

I can see it now

e como faz para ter uma conta

---
Ha, you don't say. She's my favourite character actually. Doesn't make me care more about Jessie though
---
On the other hand, it's normal attack is like  brock but the missile speed is significantly cutted down, it will be quite hard to hit ppl
---
I like Spike being a smiley little cactus though, so I think no voice fits him well.
---

And also the naming yourself [insert your name] here.
---
3 IS MY FAVORITE
---
Leaked El Primo skin?
---
oh hell no
---
Whoa! That looks scary
---
Thank you!! I do enjoy her as a brawler especially with any of the star powers :D
---
Bair?
---
DISPOSABLE
---
Leon doesnt need a buff...hes still one of the best brawlers for showdown and lone star...and if hes weak, why are so many people playing him and still winning with him...yall just want hin to be overpowered.
---
Yea no shit
---
What the....
---
elo

You should‚Äôve recieved a message that says why when you entered the game.

Sadly, Reddit doesn‚Äôt take opinions very kindly... (I‚Äôll spare you this time, though)
---
Good job! But i do find the weird head angle intriguing...
---
Yeah pay to win lol
---
Same. Spike and leon
---
I like them without voice
---
Dont be so sad about it not being special, just by buying one you‚Äôve already achieved a great milestone in brawl stars! Good job:)
---
I love it! Elf Penny and Reindeer Nita with this Rosa skin would be so hype

True...I see so many leons, spikes and crows in my matches...they really are overrated.

I don't know.
---
Cool but there's a few problems
---
1 : They look like hentai characters
---
2 : Jessie looks like star shelly  combined with a construction worker
---
2 for me
---
Probably they're talking about the super duration because 6 seconds is not that much
---
It's Day 29 Of NNN bro, don't make me act up
---
Exactly. Of course bull or primo can usually kill her if she has no super. but it‚Äôs so op, she can literally kill anyone (Other than really ranged brawlers like piper, Brock, and crow). And her star power makes her even more op. It‚Äôs just a constant resetting of her super, every time she uses it.
---
A legendary pack,without a skin,costs about 700 gems.But it may come with an offer.

I did it 1 time fore a friend this subreddit dose it 5885488448 times

i know no one care about my opinion, but he is still thicc :(

Leon survived in Supercell Nerf Home with no buffs for so long now he is in Supercell Buff Home üòù

That depends on you ;)

people dont get that this is satire?

CLUTCH AF

These are all Perfect!!!!

Im ok with open map but -

1- please add wall for protection

2 - remove that water feature from Brawl Ball map :)

Supercell: YES SIR!!
---
I love that one

Then we die later

Tell me how I max out 28 brawlers, all I got from my two boxes was tickets coins and gems

I hope u get them all ‚ù§Ô∏èüåπüëç

removing the scar is uneccessary, and I think it makes him look more like a monster

it's ok

Hey guys! Just here requesting to supercell name the next brawler Chris, I just play with the word Christmas, and its actually a good name, what you think?? Greetings from mexico sincerly Brawler Cyo Yatusae_YT!üåµüåµ
---
Weekend
---
Im not saying its impossible to counter them. Its just hard to do so when they can hit you but you cant hit back every time
---
E
---
Discounted, Leon has never been less than 349 gems for himself alone.
---
#***E***
---
I bought it.... No new brawler
---
What about Leon‚Äôs super? He turns invisible, shellys supper allows her to shoot through walls. Gene can grab you through walls. Piper can shoot from a really far distance before you can even get to her. 
---
They are all super powerful in their own way. You‚Äôre just choosing one thing to cry about and then you want to cry again 18 day‚Äôs later
---
Damn it, it was too much, I lost NNN
---
Carl is my name
---
Throwers can hit from over walls. These brawlers you list here must not be obstructed to try and hit you. Meaning nothing can be in their way when they attempt to hit you. Throwers on the other hand use walls. Its like cheating
---
This is great! Keep going and voila
---
I have been playing for over a year but  solo is not my favourite, I thought Bo would be good for this map because of his star power so I played a lot and I noticed this on many games .
---
Its not like cheating when it‚Äôs part of the game. I‚Äôm not gonna argue man. If you don‚Äôt like it. Don‚Äôt play. Stop crying about it every day
---
Good job you ruined my childhood for this cute picture üòÇ
---
Ahh yes FEAR ME
---
Am i crying? No. Im stating my opinion like every other human on this planet. If you dont respect it then thats alright. If you disagree then thats alright. Carry on with your day
---
Y‚Äôall play with sound?

Then why do you play Pipe errr
---
Can you fucking stop spamming
---
Can I crosspost that to r/shellygang? Thats awesome!
---
And then, without mercy, Carl ran over the frogs.
---
Yes, you can
---
So incredibly cute!!!!! Do u have an insta profile where u post art?
---
Ya it's really annoying and it bugs me whenever I play
---
I‚Äôm sorry but that is not stealing your stupid if you think that. The only things they have in common is that they are short and green.
---
pickle sandwiches
---
If you don't get it, it's what Stevie T says

I would buy this even if it was 150 gems

I probably would have seen it more clearer and not have to repeat 5 times of ya didn't shake it that #HARD

I like the idea! I also think this is an extra difficult map so since supercell as a business doesn‚Äôt want to give out as many tokens it‚Äôd be excellent for them üôÉ! But seriously, I like the idea! Way to go!

It‚Äôs a good way to keep brawlers warm for the winter too üòÖüòÖüòÖ

Who is karios ?

Agreed. My back is breaking from looking at this
---
People say that it surely won't come back but... why? It is only a skin. We don't want remodel to the old version. Just a skin for Rico. It looks great and brings some nostalgia. I like it.

Currently playing my third account and I'm doing a one brawler at a time to 500 trophies without upgrading them. I play brawl ball solo only and only play new brawlers once I have the last one to exactly 500( I get it to exactly 500 in solo showdown though)

T√ºrk m√ºs√ºn?

Some so
---
they should put brocks one back also oh wait another brock skin
---
thats actually the bullet of a Anti-tank rifle used in WW2
---
Skins ideas are really epic, but Supercell never put they in the game :c
---
Okie dokie.
---
Nope. I‚Äôve had it happen before in real games. It is very frustrating.
---
Whats wrong with this? Mortis isn't a great brawler but he can escape easily from brawlers its all about strategy and your team obviously
---
Good idea
---
Cool but Leons sucks
---
Is that sarcasm or true?
---
True but there is going to be a point to just get them. I was at 8 k when 2nd power came out. Out of all 24 I only gotten 3 or 4. The rest I bought them all in the shop.

Takes out the skill gap. No

also nobody really gives a shit if pam gets a supersuit or not
---
Oh wait I mixed it up with hideout my bad
---
This is so smart
---
Don't use it then.
---
You have 3 starpowers to choose from.
---
On the other hand i find it to be really underwhelming unless you gain more damage by bouncing on walls (that way you can trickshot yourself to nuke enemies) because Bulls charge is slow and easily avoidable.
---
Ball?
---
Idk a flower
---
They could hardcode it so it's never a the first SP you get with Bull.
---
That makes sense
---
I really like the Great Brocket.
---
Sure decimating enemies with a well aimed barrage is cool and all but... a big explosion bro.

What about this for Piper?:

Sneaky Flight: When Piper uses her Super, she goes invisible while in the air until she lands.
---
Nah man it‚Äôs totally real
---
Why do dynas do this...
---
Fucking beautiful
---
And they are both named Spike
---
Instead of being bought, it should be free for all accounts created before Ricochet was changed to Rico...similar to the Star Shelly skin.
---
Or, the devs set them up this way
---
0.0623

Yeah man I guess blind and I can‚Äôt tell that it‚Äôs photoshopped

Thanks, Sherlock
