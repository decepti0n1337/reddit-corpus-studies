Quality and quantity are different things. I understood that your problems with Brawl Stars are not mine as well. I have no bugs or I don't care about Trophy Road. The only other thing you talked about, was redesign. You say they are taking too long. SuperCell thinks first about quality (what Brawl Stars has) and redesign are also not very important. Thay want to make the best redesigns as possible. As I said earlier they didn't have all ready for global launch (like other small companies) and that's why they take so long.
---
I your opinion, what should they change in their work and system?
---
Wow how long have you been

Making a report button isn't the answer if that is what you are implying, in most games it is just a button for someone to spam when they tilt. It also can be a strategy if say you are Dyna and facing a mortis, teaming with a bull/shelly would be strategic. Or maybe in a Utopian society...

That is just a modifier though, and I would not want to play if life leech took over the base showdown.

Don't understand why the changed him he was perfect the way he is now he looks like a fat drunk dumbass

i know its sad

So guys we did it we reached 1 fiftth of 100000 throphys

It doesn't do extra damage, when you do the third shot the poison does effect. :)

Concept is cool but it‚Äôs likely scoring will be very low and difficult, unless catapults were added to any map this is being used on.
---
I wanted the star token 
---
I dont have him either but I think he needs a rework and not just a straight up buff. Playing against him is so fucking annoying. Poison lasts way too long
---
Eventually this will become easy because we will have so many more brawlers. Right now the 13K profile pic means something, but later it will mean pretty much nothing, only that you like and spent time into the game. Maybe they should increase the trophies for that profile pic or just make some more really cool ones. Would give reason to grind at least.

---
I was saving 45 boxes and 4 big boxes i opened the game to play and i accidentally opened one big box :(
---
I would love to set this as my background. I understand why artists watermark their creations - Instagram thieves etc. Would you consider selling un-watermarked copies?
---
Yah I‚Äôve had 100 trophy death spiral.
---
I have almost max power points for all brawlers but getting the gold is a pain
---
Um.... you probably need to get some friends to play with you, some good team comp suggestions are tanks, some long range and maybe a healer. Probably something like pam, el primo, bull, colt, leon, jessie (ok not that good), and maybe a tara would be okay to do too. 
---
One time I got so pissed I bit my phone and broke the screen 
---
On the reddit ama, brawl stars Dev team agreed, that crow does NOT need one. Idk if it's a joke, but they seemed pretty specific about it. He's so fast, and his damage over time is real beneficial.
---
His ult out of a bush,  with a good crow player is insane. I used to underestimate crows. They're pretty good if they're pro

Rico‚Äôs remodel hurt me

I‚Äôm a bit late to the party here (was lurking after commenting on one of your other posts), but here‚Äôs my suggestion.
---
I figured you have over an 80% chance of receiving Carl. It really doesn‚Äôt matter which way you open the boxes unless you got lucky and received the new brawler within the first 10 draws. 
---
What I will say, as you get close to achieving star powers (not sure where you are on that progression), you‚Äôll want to start with regular brawl boxes in some instances. For example, I just opened 5 brawl boxes to get Dynamike to level 9, so that I can use a mega box to attempt getting his star power. Now imagine the reverse. Instead, I open the mega box for the coins, and then I level up Dynamike. I then open 5 boxes. 
---
In the latter case, I only had 5 chances at Mikes star power. In the former case, I had 10.
---
Sorry if my post is convoluted. Some might argue that I‚Äôm overthinking it, but I‚Äôm an economist‚Äîmy life is all about overthinking the math to optimize the outcome. 
---
I‚Äôm happy to answer questions if you have any. GL on getting Carl.

Hmm. That‚Äôs not even all the brawlers tho and there‚Äôs still many more to come so I think it‚Äôll just bc kinda too small and unpleasing to the eye but I can understand why you‚Äôd want this!

Oh lets break it doooowwwnnnnn

Nah...my favorite is when I have a teammate Primo, and I am watching him thinking, "Ok...all you have to do is stand between the enemy and the goal to block his shot while we spawn as there is no way that guy is dumb enough to try and walk it in vs an El Primo." Then I just sit there and watch my teammate Super to the enemy for no damn reason as they just shoot a free goal under him. Just El Primo things I guess..

What do you mean?

Do you live in europe? If not we would have a problem with the servers
---

---
That don't work with friends and you can even get the star token too
---
Do you have an abundance of coins? If not, I recommend holding off so that you can level up more Brawlers in the meantime. At a 1% probability, star powers come by often, which makes it seem unreasonable for them to be priced so high.

Why bring up kids? It‚Äôs not like adults are any better with video games.

I really like the idea of it

Yeah that's a French saying, felt like adding a French vibe to it

I'm positive that if they bring normal showdown back I can get above 14k...and life leech would make teamers scarcer making showdown even more viable
---
I said it for siege
---
I Have one account

True story. Especially worse when they are bragging they got one... AND EVEN WORSE when they are lower trophies than you... AND EVEN MORE WORSE when you open Mega Boxes and get nothing, but they get Leon from a Brawl Box. üòëüò§

Yeah.. If you lose 14 times in a row, it's not solely because of your teammates

Highly doubt it's enough to live on. Even with a moderate community of 150 daily viewers and 100 steady subscribers you still can't make a living out of it. 
---
Streaming full-time requires quite some.

&gt;Imagine judging people that work longer hours than you because the work is different (entertainment)

Imagine thinking being a streamer = you automatically earn enough money to make a living out of it.

i don‚Äôt see the problem with this matchmaking? you are within 100 trophies of your enemy‚Äôs brawlers. matchmaking would take so long if it matched you with brawlers writhing 20 trophies of you.

If you‚Äôre asking about the brawlers it depends on the ramdom players you‚Äôre end up and the brawler they picked for the game. Matchmaking works based on the trophies for what‚Äôs written in the game. So you could end up with the worst two ramdom brawler for a specific game if the players chose them.
---
That‚Äôs why the pros will play with their club mates or friends and pick the brawlers that‚Äôll be the best for the match and depending on what their teammates choice as well to get the best team.
---
KairosTime released a video on youtube which explains the best brawlers for each game based on discussion from pro players.

Again, I said It was not about trophies. It's on siege so question: how were we supposed to look for bolts and actually be able to hold em when bull smokes all your team mates with one shot since you know, around 3000 HP for all of them, jessie is there to finish his work and bo, well, bombs all over the map?

He could throw a pickaxe that stands still at tip of his range whrilling at one place for 3,5 sec to deal 800dmg per sec ( lvl 1 ) or he boomerangs pickaxe at enemies that will bounce off 3 enemy targets with 740 dmg (lvl 1 )

What's the point of this post?

Yeah but now showdown seems to mostly have modifiers. 
---
We went from always having a showdown with no modifiers and occasionally having a showdown with modifiers at the same time to now only having one showdown that more often than not has modifiers.
---
At the very least they could alternate the modifiers but ive seen back to back modifiers.
---
They more or less shit on everyone that prefers showdown.

I dont hate gem grab/brawl ball/heist but I prefer to play those with friends.

"look here pumpkin head, you're all done"

Ok yes that can happen. However the brawlers that can do the most damage to him are typically sharpshooters which means that their projectiles take time to come towards the primo, thus giving you time to react and get out of the way. I am not saying he is the best brawler to pick, but I am saying that he is a viable pick and can stir up the power dynamics in this traditionally sharpshooter oriented map.

Ye its so annoying. Sorry for the salt but thats how i know to speak/write.

The only brawler that would have trouble killing primo running backwards is bull. Every single other one can kill primo before he gets to the safe. The only way he stirs up the power dynamic is giving the win to the other team 
---
Yeah what the heck,unless if they gem then what the F*CK
---
a negative one would give 2 bolts instead of 1. Also, the stats of these bolts can be changed
---
And I‚Äôm saying it should, so should overall trophies, but more importantly it should, every time a new brawler comes I don‚Äôt want to deal with a bunch of maxed out genes with only 100 trophies, that‚Äôs not skill based, in fact explain to me how that‚Äôs skill based

I think something like this leaves it open for people to abuse it and downvote people just for the hell of it. 
---
Not sure if there were/are any League of Legends players, but their Honor system was decent. Not perfect - but at least it left it open for people to vote or note vote and leaves it so people can't really troll and "down vote" other players. 
---
I Did They Support Dont Give Me The Answer
---
&gt;Like I said. There are stages to this. And you are in the denial stage.
---
I thought you weren't gonna lecture me? 
---
&gt;Nobody "has limits" where they go around thrashing items over a tantrum about a game. Only people with anger management issues do. And pretending like things were OK to break that clearly had value to it is part of the denial.
---
Are you sure, because I did. Not the first and not the last so don't go around spouting nonsense. 
---
I'd like you to tell me if you're qualified to diagnose me? 
---
Who is pretending to believe what I did was okay? Also no it wasn't valuable, I have another J3 Achieve. Unless you know me, or are me you'll know what is valuable to me, perhaps it would be valuable to you but not me since I got this phone for free from my brother. 
---
&gt;Stop kidding yourself. Let your therapist know you did this and ask them if "everyone has their limits" before getting violent.
---
Actually the first day they took my case, the therapist wanted me to point out what 'triggers' me and informed me that we all have are limits but should actively try to calm ourselves down. Which is why I said we all have limits.
---
&gt;In which case... You have an extremely low tolerance before getting violent.
---
Hahaha, no. Again you're not me and you don't know me. I don't get 'violent', I'd get in every fight in the NYC subway if that were true.

2 lvl 10 brawlers can't do anything aagzinst them x)
---
maybe 4 boxes 
---
The real question is why is there a 2k difference between 3 and 4 
---
I'd 100% like to see that in game, that way also people that want modifiers can have them at all times
---
Yes, I can agree there are downsides to all options.  I don't see changing a mode for all brawlers to make one brawler a viable means to correcting balancing between brawlers.  
---
You are also correct that if you narrow crows shot too much it will be a nerf more than a buff.  However, you could bring it in slightly.  Right now at the end it is so wide that you can actually miss players because the brawler splits two darts.  I know this is happening because I have watched it happen.  Narrowing this slightly so a brawler cannot split the darts would help or making it so if they were splitting the darts they still took at least one hit of damage would help.  You don't have to narrow it where you can hit all 3 darts at mid range but maybe 2 at mid range and 1 at max range would be good.  He has a roughly 45 degree spread.  I am suggesting it go to a 30 or 35 degree spread.  This should be sufficient for scouting bushes and close up gaps in his attack.  
---
Your right he doesn't need to be the same hp as mortis and Leon.  Getting him up to about 4000 at max level would allow him to at least take an extra hit.  He is still on the low end of all brawlers and would need to stay ranged but it gives him a fighting chance against other long range brawlers.  I'm not talking extremes just slight increases.  Well the damage increase was a little extreme but hey we all can dream.
---
Anyway it was a good discussion.  It's good to hear other thought out opinions on it.

No I honestly don‚Äôt see why that‚Äôs a problem, it doesn‚Äôt just guarantee the Jessie another 100 trophies and what you described right there is the basis of a Freemium game with in app purchases 
---
Good point about the luck system, the majority of the achievements would definitely be about stuff like you earn/work for, for example trophies. 
---
Always check out the bushes
---
No pls no
---
This is a bad map but the concept is good.
---
That would kind of destroy the games economy
---
having multiple supers is such a cool idea! but i think it would be hard to balance. don't get me wrong, i really like this concept. i would love to see new supers for the brawlers i have cause im kinda bored with them. good work dude!
---
his super can make him travel across the water
---
Nah the game is pretty good but a buff to crow would Be good even If i dont have crow
---
Animee
---
It won't. They released him in game, tested it out before hand. (But bugs can creep into ANY place, so ynk)
---
Gorgeous 
---
Hate cavern churn
---
HeWwO tHeRe
---
Yes, but at least it should have more emphasis on power levels than it is right now , to prevent a team to have much more advanced than the other ,right?(I‚Äôm sure there are more extreme examples than mine)
---
I have 5100 and I will say: play TOO MUCH the showdown mode
---
Not enouth close
---
This is an amazing idea 
---
My favorite
---
None of my friends are playing this game. (Who am I kidding? I have no friends. :( )
---
Oh thanks, haven‚Äôt notice 
---
\*short scream\*
---
He dose'nt have any friendsüòñ
---
Wow
---
This post took me ages to make
---
It's just beautiful 
---
Wath?
---
Too similar to the Clash Royale challenge page in my opinion
---
exactly
---
There already are.
---
Now i cant eat brocoli anymore
---
I can‚Äôt believe people still don‚Äôt realize this
---
Sidebar let's you edit your flair
---
whats wrong with brocks range?
---
and pam OP rn
---
piper is unstoppable with energy drink                         unless of course  ELLL PRIMMMOOO
---
You make a lot of assumptions from one figure, no I‚Äôm not a max player and no I don‚Äôt bitch about matching up with low players. Let me guess you‚Äôre aged 10-15 because you don‚Äôt seem to recognise how fake systems work as well as the financial sides of business 
---
This is very good for being drawn by hand
---
Damn, you put soo much effort in to this...
---
It should but it isnt even implemented in game yet
---
Imagine it spinning! 
---
 thats sad if true  (hope its not)
---
Thanks it means a lot I will try making more but they take a lot of time and effort
---
Keep up the good work!
---
Thnx
---
Welc :)
---
Make the video shorter. Also dammmmmnnnn
---
stop flexing bull as shoot the DAMMN BALLL
---
üòÄ
---
Brawl ball is the most fun gamemode ... if you can do trickshots and shoot between players and get epic goals u will change your mind u just need skills-_- 
---
this is not your work
---
Leon constantly disappearing when the teacher says there a pop quiz. Dynamike, Crow and Piper using their supers/star power to hop out and skip class. A hole in the wall where Bull entered because he used his super to get to class on time. 
---
i aggree with pausing regen during a gene pull and nerf to leon and pam
---
##Several thousand people are typing...
---
Spoil : the end is sad
---
I built a little fence around me made of power-up boxes. All of the bulls auto-aimed to the boxes meanwhile I built a big turret that‚Äôs even stronger than big boss Jessie‚Äôs turret. GG dudes
---
wait..that‚Äôs illegal 
---
Oh like chemic
---
what are you talking about?
---
Oh I like being behind Bars especially the ones that serve vodka
---
Multiply your brawler chance by the amount of brawl boxes you have
---
chemistry* but yes
---
Honestly this is the best event background I've ever seen.
---
(I've experienced this as well.)
---
Posso essere un moderatore?
---
Love it
---
Hey guys do you all know why brawl star always lag with WiFi even if I got a 150 Mbps connection? 
---
WATCH YO DAMN MOUTH!!!
---
Brawl Ball is my favourite mode.
---
in spanish it should be quimico/quimica wdym
---
RIP
---
4 big 50 little
---
Sicko mode
---
We need that
---
When I play as Darryl, I always think that I can kill Crow, but he's just too fast... He's low damage and low health, but he can easily run away from Darryl when he uses his Super. (And Crow's Super is good for retreating/finishing off Darryl.)
---
u/riochann5230 is my favourite
---
I‚Äôd love to be that turret right now. Just behind Jessie. That turrets nose is what my junk is lookin like now.
---
Upvote for use of a Star Wars meme.
---
We were close to reaching 10 pixels in the image
---
Shut
---
Nita could have a larger earth tremor as her super, which hits in a square/circle that does 2000 but she is slowed when casting it but it also slows enemies caught by 40%
---
Lmao I have
---
Well I love how I can intimidate players just because I chose Leon or Darryl lol although a Bull or Shell makes a better job at this
---
Yes that‚Äôs what this clip is about
---
Baby
---
If I correctly understand you (I am not sure, my translator badly help), my Winty will always fly, and because of that he will move more quickly. Like Carl, for example. Also, we can change his super ability. He can fly up and fly over the hands of his teammates creating small clouds from which snow will fall. And this snow will treat your teammates for few seconds.
---
I think the idea is good, but idiotic randoms could downvote you after losing even if they were the ones who caused you to lose
---
Is that weed! Arrested at ounce. *Takes weed and starts rolling it up* I‚Äôll be back just got a write some papers
---
He is actually pretty good now I have played him. I changed my mf mind..
---
Yeah, if it looks good sure. It will definitely be quite clear!
---
One time I killed someone AT THE LAST SECOND but the game still ended.
---
Just like my ass
---
This is the most beautiful skin that I have ever seen 
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure Supercell manages money for different games, not just combined. It makes sense seeing as they have different developer teams for different games, and I also don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs wise to just make a large investment like this just because of some complaints like this. They‚Äôre more likely to just remove event modifiers completely tbh.
---
I agree on the fingers, but yes, this could be a nice change!
---
It‚Äôs just an idea
---
Troll
---
No way
---
When old rico was badass
---
You‚Äôre*
---
Can you give up a T post of all 3 crows on r/crowgang please and how did you get that?
---
So many randoms having really bad Reputation. In fact, I think no one with only one account would have a good reputation
---
Second super might be complicated 
---
Maybe second sp 
---
Wtf lmao üòÇ
---
Yeah that last shot at the hiding shelly was random, I would have picked them if I didn‚Äôt kill her lol
---
Crow‚Äôs star power should be to have the poison stack
---
Triangle as barley
---
No it says new and a post from like 10 hours ago
---
 &gt;That's the thing, shelly is amazing early game
---
I hope you are talking about Gem Grab here because that is completely false on SD.
---
how many trophies does your crow have?
---
Thank you üòÑüòÑ
---
dude that was kinda obvius, standing still while spinning do not has much sense
---
It‚Äôs honestly better than GEDIS. no hate but it‚Äôs pretty annoying and others need respect
---
What if someone is being a troll and downvotes all of their teammates even though they got carried?
---
Icy what you did there 
---
He reach 440plus, but now got tilt. His 405 now.
---
Good idea
---
Happy cake day!

Soy el mejoor!
---
Makes you a king bro 
---
What do you mean? This map has so many bushes  (for Spike of course.)
---
Yeah I just wanted to say this before Carl releases
---
This is an interesting idea! Any art work for this?
---
Relatable gem amount
---
OK thanksÔºÅ
---
*cough ... El Primo
---
Nice bulge
---
is this a joke that im not getting?
---
EXACTLY
---
but supercell showed a little Carl gameplay where they said that he can move while spinning 
---
Jeez fine I'll delete it
---
Bulls in bushes is fine because a bull would die instantly because of long rangers  if he runs around in the open.
---
To be fair the assumption was dumb, I just see a lot of high level players whine about one problem without realizing the hipocrasy of what their saying, anyways while I don‚Äôt see the damping of money flow your right, I am looking at one system but something making money doesn‚Äôt mean I think it‚Äôs fair, and many others agree.
---
An complete separate model for Crow that is used during his super animation.
---
Happy cake day
---
I‚Äôd buy this skin in a heartbeat it‚Äôs bad ass!
---
Flair checks out
---
Very skilled *laughs*
---
Yes you are correct. The encounter will end in a failure if you play primo by just trying to rush. However if you play primo smart you can dodge those projectiles and push in. Also towards the late game when the dividers in the middle are gone it becomes easier to play and maneuver around the projectiles. 
---
That‚Äôs actually the best concept I‚Äôve seen in this subreddit
