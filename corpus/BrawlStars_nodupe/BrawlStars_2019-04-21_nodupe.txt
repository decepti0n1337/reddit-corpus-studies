So damn satisfying.

---
---
Yup.
---
Awww
---
Just go to the water then go get Leon :P
---
Cucumber Spike
---
You won‚Äôt

Don't worry about it haha, I meant flex btw. You know, like it's a phrase now ;)

Ur a joke
---
Anything is possible
---
What is happening XD
---
i‚Äôd rather have them do leon‚Äôs super
---
I noticed that!
---
This was made for a fan art contest before Gene, Carl and Leon
---
Best way for me to lose all my coins
---
Spike has the potential to deal more dmg than Shelly close range, plus his super is one of the best in games. Bull has a better chance going against a Shelly than a spike in any given case.
---
I like this even though is old. can you update it pls.
---
ABGHUAGHUAGHUA
---
It hurts me inside every time I see it used wrong
---
NW Mortis is honestly just a flex on Free to players
---
*She's sugar and spice*
---
This looks like a filter
---
100th upvoter!

shhh nobody needs to know that

RIP tara spike and darryl (and le√≥n but that One need a buff or no more nerfs before a voice line)

no.

I opened 23 boxes and a box just this day and got nothing
---
Lol its in order you bot
---
[s] true loll having a brawer with 676 trophies, it's just someone with 676 total trophies
---
You are invading my Reddit XD. Thanks dude.
---
Just buy
---
True. But some people are good at it, and it provides another alternative to get coins.
---
I hope she is a 30 gem skin
---
I just find your posts funny
---
Lol thanks man üëçüëç

What's the peak performance here. Shelly is the worst brawler in game rn. Crow is above average. You had a 4 poweup advantage. 
---
Not saying you bad played, you just did what mostly anyone could. It's like flexing beating mike w a mortis
---
Mortis should be beautiful IMO I find it awesome
---
I understand,. What are some exploits you have in mind? I have some. Maybe some cheating with high trophy bands, but at the same time, most of them have maxed accounts.
---
Lol thanks!
---
When you know you pay attention to detail to much
---
This is wrong unless they recently changed it. I got Leon on my mini that doesn‚Äôt have all brawlers. The offers are mostly random. New offers like new brawlers or skins are normally controlled by supercell on the day of release.
---
I'm not the artist but I'll make a request
---
He needs a super buff but a damage nerf
---
Ah
---
*ching chong*
---
 Hello! I'd like to ask you if I could use your clip as a part of my  compilation of Brawl Stars Highlights. I'm an editor for the Gaming  Curios network. You would be credited with your name on the screen along  with a link to this post. Let me know, thank you! :)
---
Shouldnt poco be in american teir
---
Yeah. I was just throwing out some suggestions (even if they‚Äôre not super cool).
---
yes
---
hol up
---
U have no life
---
At the beginning I walk towards the bot and land two attacks then I stand still next to the bot and land three
---
*Club Wars
---
You are a 500 IQ player then. Also that Shelly is triggered that you did that XD.
---
What is the definition of pro matches? If a pro player enters the game does everyone in it get broadcasted? I‚Äôm around 9.3k with 21 brawlers and I saw that I was on brawl TV, it said the game was live with like 45 people watching.
---
Does that mean that I was specifically being streamed? Or just the game in general?
---
So then I'm guessing it'd be fair to show how much ammo your enemy has as well then.
---
He got a tramp stamp.
---
I meant I rarely spend money, I play cr more then brawl stars
---
It is lol
---
XD nice
---
No f
---
He‚Äôs already balanced. Just gotta learn how to play with him.
---
Carl was angry at me :P
---
We Stars
---
Stfu*
---
Starts to draw mortis... decides not to.
---
Fucking hell I searched this out just to see if anyone else had said it, I want him to die so badly.
---
Other than different movement, it looks like she won..
---
lol you got a point there.
---
i didn't notice it, sorry my bad.
---
I have 13k trophies and I don‚Äôt even get broadcasted 24/7
---
Hey, that PFC doesn't rate a blood stripe!
---
1s left before your teammate respawns
---
Thanks ‚ú®

"Tags my friend that doesn't have reddt"

_Not the face!_
---
New here, what does spin rate mean
---
THIS IS AMAZING
---
He didn't? I can easily find a website to make these images for you. Also how are you so sure?
---
I see. Maybe it might just be the maps.
---
Bull and Shelly: HAPPINESS NOISE
---
Errrr. Okay? Guess you can't see im stacking her ulti lol.
---
I love this.
---
No that she can stack it continously
---
I've noticed this a lot lately, hopefully this can get some attention
---
Indeed it was not a fair match.
---
that happens when you go on a losing streak i think
---
I'm level 99, only 17 brawls
---
I'm sorry
---
I HAVE HOTTEN THAT AND ITS SO FRUSTRATING
---
my friend is a leon, and is only missing gene and crow
---
Dang, it was 5v4v1 and everyone survived for *that* long??
---
Hot Maze removed? wtf Supercell!! how will I push Nita now??
---
Well that‚Äôs cuz Leon is useless in cavern churn. Geez dude have some perspective
---
On his description, it says "he"
---
Would you get coins for every powerpoint donated like in clash royale?
---
Yeah but ‚Äúhe‚Äôs‚Äù a robot
---
Join Nova Circle a new and active club! The logo is a magenta banner with a star!
---
if everyone else is teaming and you are the only one by yourself, yes
---
Rico tem que ser gordo
---
Dude the devs have their handful seriously they have added so much into the game that the community has asked for. It‚Äôs hard to design a game and squish all the bugs in it. Be grateful.
---
So if other people are next to eachother and you are alone you will get healed?
---
1 WEEK LATE AND NOBODY CARES
---
Cool.
---
Lol i am that guy. But why that guy have so little trophies?
---
OOGA BOOGA
---
Good ‚Äòol Gene treatment.
---
This looks like it was done by 3 different people and whoever was supposed to draw the Nita gave up
---
I feel like they're gonna do it to Rosa
---
Since like others mentioned, they wouldn‚Äôt do it cause of the gambling aspect, what they can do is have you root for a team or brawler in showdown
---
Sorry I'm not experienced
---
Is it ok tho?
---
You have to keep mortis! But otherwise nice job!
---
I thought on the bigger ones they‚Äôd do it with American days, interesting!
---
Imagine if he could use EL MUNDO
---
They're just kids, it's adorable but don't ship them too much
---
No puedo sacarte la mierda si no te acercas
---
This meme format is the best
---
here I am stuck in 5.4k no star power no level 10 or whatsoever. win once, lose 10 times straight to my a**. I think there will be a time I uninstall the game. but yeah thats what you get when you play with randoms.
---
Guys the devs work as hard as they can. If they need more time, give them some more time. People get impatient and ask what the next update is gonna be. If you don‚Äôt want that, don‚Äôt be impatient.
---
It doesn‚Äôt make sense haha
---
Oh
---
Not spike, the insult is saying mortis looks bad
---
Because I bought it the second it came out, from the character itself. Look at my profile. I posted about it. But I talked to supercell about it and they gave me 21 gems back.
---
I hope they never change them to make the game more family friendly...
---
Should I take it down?
---
Delete it
---
Disco names are neat.
---
Me too
---
Question: what would happen upon activation of her super?
---
Listen buddy, you and I both know that you‚Äôre not ‚Äúshipping‚Äù friendships. You‚Äôre implying some sort of romantic relationship. You‚Äôre making comments based on which ‚Äúcouple‚Äù you‚Äôd rather see together out of the characters on this thread. Why do you have to bring any sort of romance into the picture with these kids? Just because there is a game (especially one with children characters marketed for children) doesn‚Äôt mean that you have to sexualize or romanticize characters. Regardless, you asked for my opinion in the post and I gave it. I think this is gross and uncomfortable even if you‚Äôre just implying ‚Äúinnocent cute holding-hands type relationships.‚Äù
---
Not to mention the amount of images of seen of Jessie on this sub as a mature sexualized woman. Yuck.
---
Probably
---
Made With Pixel Crux
---
Ok
---
A bunch of hay would cover her
---
Definitely not a fortnite skin ripoff
---
I love the leon! There are what? 1...2...3 of them!
---
I feel your pain. Minus the star token part
---
I opened 5 big boxes and 80+ boxes when Carl was released and didn‚Äôt get him, kept opening whenever I got a new one and still don‚Äôt have him, yet when Leon came out, I got him within 10 tries
---
FBI OPEN UP!
---
Too pretty for pain!
---
If the players are teaming?
---
Oh I was thinking you went out of your way and decided to buy it at full price knowing u could have bought at discounted price
---
Lmao this would never happen but what a brilliant idea
---
This takes streaming to the next level.
---
Huh? I don‚Äôt get it?
---
I like the grass design
---
I know this, I was sharing how many I got here and said how many I have saved up.
---
Wait footprints is a thing? (Feels like a noob even though he only started 2 months ago)
---
Saved up in general, not this picture.
---
Lol I wish I had that many gems. If I had that many gems I‚Äôd be giving 10 gems to every el primo I see then let them jump into any spawn they want.
---
Wow you‚Äôre so cool! Way to show off your money while ‚Äúbeing humble‚Äù. I want to be you when I grow up!
---
First of all showdown only has max 10 players
---
I think u were also supposed to say r/punpatrol
---
He shot himself
---
Kind of. Since you're betting coins, and others get double the amount.
---
Crow should be "Beautiful" because he's got that *NOICE* New Yorker voice
---
If this were a thing, you can have a friend or an alt account watch the match, and the when you go on your account or your main account, you can just do a the max bet for that match, because you already saw it so you know what to put in
---
In your post you said to not buff him. Now you are asking for one?
---
He used to be baggage and they buffed his damage and his star power which made him top 5 now they nerfed his star power and hes top 15 at best.
---
I think randoms and the brawler you use is more important than the power. I push most of my brawler to rank 15 and slowly push up the trophies ,  I only play a few matches everyday ,just to get the star tokens
---
Oh I get it, the # of brawl boxes and the date today (4/20)
---
jeon ü§î
---
&gt;I mean he is  op against throwers  (barley and dynamike)
---
For a second I thought this was by GEDI-KOR XD
---
Why there is a‚Äú‰∫õ‚Äù before the ‚Äú‰∫öÊ¥≤‰∫∫ÁöÑÂêçÂ≠ó‚Äù,‚ÄôAsian names‚Äô already means‚Äú‰∫öÊ¥≤‰∫∫ÁöÑÂêçÂ≠ó‚ÄùÔºåbut that ‚Äú‰∫õ‚Äù means ‚Äòsome‚ÄôÔºåI‚Äôm an Asian but I hate a lot of other Asians which never treat the game seriously,specially kids and mean person.
---
Thanks I hate it
---
Photo credits to u/epicgamermortis

true
---
I said I want one, no asking for one BUT HE DOESN'T DESERVE IT
---
I never said they are.
---
DUDE UR SOOOOO LUCKY
---
I got Pam early on tho lol
---
Pic credits to u/epicgamermortis
---
Penny is near bottom tier, she doesnt deserve that place
---
Why tf does this not have more upvotes, a post with the same exact meme template with different words with an open mouth spike be getting 200 upvotes and an actual useful idea to the game isn't getting as many. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
One thing to think about is for people who have all power 10s/all the power points, how they will donate, and secondly, giving them gold for that is super useless cuz they have gold sitting there that they don't need.
---
if i got i on brawl tv i would kill myself if this was added so people waste their money
---
*nyeheheEaeEaEAAaaah*
---
I have 4500 trophies and I only had Frank which was sad. 16 brawlers now i have 18.
---
Before i got gene i was at 7.0k....
---
Damn holy shit. Which brawlers do you have?
---
They are live....
---
Even the damn Crow was teaming...
---
See you at the bottom of the new posts..
---
I need a legendary but my luck is soo good. i beat 5 dynas in rockwall brawl lol and opened a megabox that i saved from 4000 and that is what i got.
---
Yes shes only a rare
---
wdym
---
For now
---
Its a well done skin but such a bad idea, I mean his name is short for Frankenstein
---
LOVE IT
---
This is perfect in every single way
---
I agree
---
So, he is OP against a certain type of brawler. Next you‚Äôll be telling me that Shelly is OP against sharpshooters! It‚Äôs called balance, my dude
---
i have every brawlers except tara crow spike and leon. i wish i could know what a legendary looks like lol.
---
Exactly man, this is brawl stars not some anime
---
he doesn't need it, learn how to use him and his strategies
---
this ain't my first rodeo üòâ
---
Just when I play the game in a dark environment ,and with my night vision on,I can hardly recognize the star power icon under the enemy brawlers.This will do big deal if the map is like Snake Pirare or Caven churn ,because bo‚Äôs star power is op in these maps.
---
Bet GEDI-KOR wouldn't have come up with this.
---
Well, i just got Piper today!
---
(I mean, is no legendary but still!)
---
You must not be OG, then
---
Yes.
---
I was an OG, then stopped playing and lost my acc
---
That‚Äôs a good idea
---
(10/10 photoshop btw)
---

---
Remodel for Carl Please
---
Dude she‚Äôs related to poco and Rosa (when poco was alive)
---
I like the ult icon
---
He‚Äôs so nasty treatin‚Äô her rough.
---
This is amazing
---
ü§£Rooooosa!!!
---
Then call it "hey kids, which family friendly brawler will take the EüÖ±Ô∏èIC VICTORY ROYALE (vote with 20-200 coins)"
---
lol the sunflower should cover her
---
Lol
---
No im not between 18-20
---
God damn it this is amazing
---
nice skin but supercell is against hats :(
---
I don't like life leech :c
---
What
---
You will be amazed to listen.... I unlocked pam,dyna,carl,spike and gene... In mu mini in just one week..... I didn't clicked screenshots so sry... But its true
---
i'd say it's a false equivalence. baiting to backstab is often the only way to counter teaming. this guy knew that his chances of beating every teamer through awesome dodges were a lot lower than his chances of beating them through backstabbing, so he spun to backstab. i can see that backstabbing can be toxic, but at this point in the game it was basically his only option
---
UwU
---
But then you realise ur an L primo with super
---
Nice drawing! I do feel like jessie needs to end up with pennie :)
---
He need some milk
---
Teaming in bounty ,üëå
---
dont feel like changing carl  
---
crow isn't really fit for "how are they existing" because throwing poison isn't crazy
---
How does the super look like?
---
This is so retarded
---
Yup, I got him super early into the official android release but nowadays he gets slapped down by most brawlers
---

Highest respect to you my friend.

He is a geologist

He has a pickaxe and a minecart, he rides in, it's the most stereotyping mining gear
---
SWEET HOME ALABAMA
---
You sir are a genius
---
It's impossible, they have no cavity to take liquids
---
Her best mode is brawl ball, in high trophy showdown you are gonna get bullied with shelly, unless you can keep control of the centre on feast and famine.
---
Thats where ur wrong,mate he does have a beard
---
I am the only one who read this with Carl voice?
---
Your post has been removed, make sure to use the body of a post to elaborate on the title.
---
Lol a lot of jump pads
---
The progress to push trophies is long and boring, I am a little bit tired of this game . By the way it is called a big box but not medium box
---
OMG I can relate so much
---
looks like the ExTrEmElY fUnNy tIeR lIsTs are back
---
as long as the teleportation isn't to far or he doesn't have too much HP he would be balanced
---
nita: D: NOOOOOOOOAAAW!!
---
That's the thing
---
When is Rosa getting released?
---
it's actually "New customers!"
---
And I never saw anyone shipping this until now.
---
That's another one
---
They had extra speed back in the time. It was so f*** broken and the devs revert back to original. Hopefully!
---
Super

We have to die only because people are watching? Don't be ridicolous. I don't give a fuck if 100 people are watching, I care about my trophies.

Penny did it better.

What about the lonely 3000 hp colt that has 10 gems and is about to get a tasty from taras super that is 50 miles away?

Should have named it Star Power ü§î

That kid at 1500 has leon?
---
This was posted yesterday
---
Sick bro xd
---
Hoow i always lose with her.. any Tips ? Im at 405 with her
---
So cool dude
---
From 500 per blade and 10 seconds of super he Is 440 per blade and 7 seconds of super
---
nah primo when he goes against a shotgunner has to stay as far away as possible but still hit them so he should still aim
---
In which way isit ungrateful ? People pay money for content. The brawler is already there and saying "well it's on the game but we only unlock it in a week" is worse than doing two patches.
---
It's not like supercell is throwing free stuff at people and release tons of new and exciting content. 
---
Brawlers are unlocked through loot boxes and in most cases the only way to get mythic ones or legendaries in a decent time frame is buying the directly for absurd prices.
---
Add to that the release of completely stupid packs with tons of coins that noone at that level wants.
---
Add to that, that Clash Royale got at least a decent one today (100 gems+legendary chests for  2$) and we can talk about what is reasonable for a game that generates 50+ million $ revenue per month.
---
No...
---
Is ThIs A jOjO rEfErEnCe

*Don‚Äôt mind me, I‚Äôm just over here manually aiming Carl‚Äôs super.*
---
I'm crying. Of laugh of course
---
F for Bruce
---
Still if a gem grab or any other gamemode that is not showdown  ends you can see it also teaming in showdown is getting bigger and you can still find out people teaming at 200 trophies
---
Sick idea dude
---
Android Spike.
---
When did you get it and who is it?
---
she just turned into Howard the alien
---
I have him power 9, and before he got nerfed he did 700 damage per blade, now he does 616. I feel bad
---
Yes please
---
why u block out trophy road and coins?
---
Ye
---
Nice!
---
this is a great idea! If it showed that people are betting on you i would have so much stress lol. 
---
For me, whenever I see that blue eye i get super paranoid lol
---
To calsh Royale
---
Do you even understand the joke lol
---
watch it hope you also Lough at this video
---
I feel sad too, especially because I own him..
---
The last one really made me laugh lmao good job
---
Crow:$hit
---
I just wait in the bushes for the others to kill each other.eventually,there's also gonna be an energy drink spawning next to you so you can ambush anybody who wants to take it ;)
---
I see you die to poison at late game
---
Yeah but he is as fast as crow and mortis, but his damage is just insane and he can dodge shots all day and night and still deal crazy amount of damage
---
üòÇ me too bro

Please tell me you aren‚Äôt a homophobe too.
---
No one block gaos
---
Well they should. This will damage brawl stars, and Vietnam‚Äôs reputation at the same time
---
You should also not get any rewards (exept the star key) for the first win otherwise pepole could farm trophies like that
---
no i mean where did you see the stats  
---
i like your idea

I feel u had my leon at 498 next thing I know he 390 üò≠

You can make a game not pay2win and still have zero ads.

Example: Team fortress 2 (even before steam release).

Rico on the left is a dum-dum.
---
Rockstar Brawl is relatively easy, pushed my level 7 Shelly to 500 today
---
Cursed.
---
1 spectator is more valuable than 100 Brawl TV spectators. Why? Because they are friends who cares, lol.
---
Wow this is awesome,Supercell,come hereüòÇ
---
Because I don't like the actors and voice of the brawlers. I feel they are even rasist in some cases.
---
You fucking deserve that for teaming. People like you ruin solo showdown. Glad Supercell did something.
---
Yooo dude !!! *Pocho voice*
---
Just so cute! Nita goes school! Oh cutie! I'm oops... Sorry!
---
Bbb
---
Crow wouldn't be scared
---
_WHO ARE YOU_
---
Lol shelly is the easiest brawler she takes no skill easy 500

Can you not spam the same post?

He‚Äôs decent in most. Not really good in anything but gem grab, and that‚Äôs only because killing isn‚Äôt necessary
---
I don't have gold so have a cupcake üßÅ

We need to start a massive campaign to nerf this robot
---
It will be fixed to not go in the gas :? i think.
---
true but 7 is a uneven number for a gud pic
---
ahoy sponge boy me Bob,
---
I AM SUFFERING FROM A CRIPPLING NICOTINE ADDICTION. GIMME A POD BOIIII
---
Nope, but just to say he knows me too so yeah I you every play with him again just ask him about "Fisher745"
---
They jst play for the star token and other token in the game . They dont push my trophies
---
This is awsome
---
Tell me ur trophy range and when u join him tell him to call me
---
Awesomeeeee
---
Do not sexualize this game.
---
Yall must be real try hards if bo star power doesnt bother you
---
NERF #FRANK
---
How did you get those icons and skins?
---
Regular attack is too powerful and ‚Äúplantys‚Äôs‚Äù is incorrect grammar, you gotta say plantys‚Äô. Also he is pretty good otherwise
---
Somebody please explain why the graphics look like this
---
This is how I met my wife, and I‚Äôm only 16
---
Is it just me or rosa was short AF
---
Happy for you and funny fact : I also got my first legendary today morning, and it was also Crow !
---
?
---
U lookin at me?
---
What if 2 spikes from every spike shot get anchored to the ground?
---
Can I send you a gem grab map idea I worked hard on it and would be happy to see it in the game like lex's map it's called shifty launch.
---
taras not that bad, just needs polishing
---
Tf
---
I used this to find invs leons lol
---
Wish that was a thing (the only reason I'm not saying R SLASH SUBSYOUFELLFOR is because of u/antiloweffortbot
---
Birdy
---
Tbh it‚Äòs too edgy for casuals but tbh I‚Äòd like maps like this looks very funny maybe implementing some hints and increase the map size slightly would make it a funny competetive map nice job üëç
---
I also posted this to r/mortisgang
---
when you run out of ideas
---
Spinner
---
A bit too many bushes at mid but otherwise a balanced map
---
If we implemented your first change the boss would never hit anyone? Because as he got close to the ‚Äúfarthest player‚Äù, he would then be close and target another player.
---
I like this threat
---
I am officially addicted to shrooms
---
you make me un poco loco
---
Oof well to late to change it now, I'm too lazy
---
Of course it is already claimed
---
But the art comes from somewhere right ?
---
i dont know dude, my average games are about 6 minutes and we always lose bcuz of this sniper, imo, we should buff other robots lil bit and nerf his dmg for 10%
---
0.0096 got everything except crow and will smith.
---
I had no idea I was controlling the mushrooms lol. I was just in a jukey mood after killing a maxed barley that kept following me.
---
Happy easter ^^üê∞üê∞
---
This is so cursed
---
Great! Looks like gedi kors
---
Nice idea but cosmetics box should have a prize like 60-70 gems (between the prices of rare and big box) as they will add plenty of skins later on as the time passes
---
CARL IS MY NAME GEOLOGY IS MY GANE
---
The art style kinda resembles Diives
---
when ur wife aint giving you no coochie so you make a video so you can look at piper's thiccness for an hour
---
I bought mortis for chips
---
cursed^ cursed ^ cursed ^ cursed ^ cursed ^ cursed ^ cursed ^ cursed ^ cursed ^ cursed ^ cursed ^ cursed ^ cursed
---
Truce
---
"we have to die"? What do you mean? Probably "we have to not ruin everyone else's experience"? Because that would be awesome
---
I literally went through every brawler to see how much DPS they could do
---
1st place-Tara (No duh)
---
2nd place-Dynamike
---
3rd place- Piper (Its so satisfyng to watch her ult)
---
Idk
---
How about those round shits
---
Yes
---
You vs teamers lol
---
u have my respect for that
---
btw i never legit unlocked primo, bought with chips
---
Wait the Mortar is actually called Lenny?!

I was saving for shiba nita
---
As long as you don‚Äôt play with randoms you‚Äôll reach...
---
Leon+Nita pls
---
Damn! How bout crow? He‚Äôs the one brawler I bought with gems forgot how much tho
---
My favorite brawler has been soiled...and yet I find myself enjoying this a lot
---
frank isnt thicc hes D E N S E
---
It goes by trophies, that‚Äôs it.
---
Leon and Gene should be pedos. **For various reasons**
---
saving for rosa I see
---
Where are you from? I'm 6'3K as F2P since Global, btw.

No i just have add the super

---
I love the drawing, but doesn‚Äôt rico already have enough skins as it is? Just saying.... make a Tara one please üëç
---
i don't understand
---
Then why am I the only one in the 300‚Äôs? This matchmaking is broken
---
Rico and Spike - The forgotten kids...
---
So that is what Supercell have to fix. They fix many bug before. I just want they look and consider about that. After watch a replay i feel kind of angry you know.
---
üòà
---
Icons for skins finally coming?
---
...
---
My guess would be April 29 because that would be Showa day which is the Japanese holiday for the emperor Showa and sho means bright or light and wa means peace. The new Nita skin is based off the shiba which is a dog kind of like a corgi. There are two types the light and dark version and this one is based off the light. Since sho means bright or light this could imply that it would fall on Showa day. Idk maybe I‚Äôm just over thinking this a lot.
---
Thank you man, it means a lot
---
How
---
I would have loved to see a bunch of dynamikes happily spinning together
---
Did that already
---
Random fact: that Carl (Colindalgetty) is in my club
---
I LOVE THIS. put Japanese fonts for the title xDD hahhahaha
---
Wtf... Who are you? Where did this skill come from

Haha... I'm new on Reddit do you know if we can delete old posts? I accidentally posted same picture twice
---
**RANDOMS**
---
You did but you said it in a different way
---
probally a third party website or app
---
I mean they get it too... I have 87 boxes rn and that probably wont get me anything
---
Fuck. I had this idea and started making the video. I am so sad.
---
Crow gang!
---
It is, I have it,I thought that shiba nita is better but then I bought the bunny penny skin and it is amazing
---
Tweety?
---
Bull, please stop drooling.
---
It looks decent but there are too many walls, which is an huge advantage to throwers.
---
Do legendaries ever appear in the shop for cash?

Darryls super??? You mean darryls stat power??
---
Pewdiepie
---
He sure got buffed!
---
I used Rico and Piper and got 5 to 1 place almost all the time BUT my Rico and Piper are low trophies so if your Piper or Rico is 400+ trophies I don't thing it's gonna work maybe check brawl stats
---
Bought crow power points. Good man.
---
Stick Arena Ballistick. It was a Free-For-All Stickman game from a couple years back

Hahaha was good

true af
---
How do I say ‚ÄúFUCK‚Äù in Gene‚Äôs language?
---
You know it
---
ya because this it the most important issue rn
---
Same but without Carl too and at 4600
---
Watch out! Don't get too greedy for all of those boxes in the grass! You never know who might be lurking...
---
No I say its rigged because almost every single globalnplayer has got a legendary at around 700 trophy range.
---
And the problem is THEY GET THEM!!1!
---
You know your not the only person coming up with this idea I bet like 100 bucks at least more than 10 people have had that idea before you.
---
Tnx
---
The same thing was posted like...10 times
---
Lmao i always spin dynamike in the lobby. Only epic gamers can time it so that he lands as soon as he completes a spin
---
Yeah
---
With ten gems?
---
yeah. it was pretty satisfying to watch \^-\^
---
pam gave him a little too much to eat
---
Barrack Obama
---
The same thing happened to my shelly. She is rank 16, 308/380 trophies
---
Okay, uploading a video of the activity log just for you
---
I have the same just change tara with spike
---
If u play 3v3 with mortis and I u have a good team its so much fun, because there u can play a little bit aggro and its so much fun (except heist and bb of course, you shouldnt even be playing him there)
---
r/usefulredcircle
---
I think only the boxing one needs a remodel the rest are ok
---
Because you can count him as an instant attacker while his scattershots are in slow attack speed (since it‚Äôs not instant)
---
Why they added thiccochet? Since this damn robot is so much better?
---
HE DOESN'T MISS ONE SHOT!!!!
---
*Hey wait a minute...*
---
I did, there‚Äôs nothing
---
I dont play solos, but for duos I recommend brock, nita, spike, crow, leon, Carl, gene, colt, or even 1 of the 3 tanks if you have a good ranged teammate.
---
LOL! I think that is really good luck
---
*mii swordfighter*
---
He even blurred his name
---
I got Leon at around 4.5k Trophy range and I'm Global Player
---
You can check my profile now and see how bad my losing streak was
---
Agreed. Got the couple of gems needed for that 1000 token doublers! Wish it was like that every day.
---
Tbh ok. But Piper, oh Piper...she‚Äôs got a handlebar for some reason.
---
Ikr it a joke he said in the comments becuase his name and address was on there but like why piece it there in the first place
---
Nice man, I got my Leon from 2nd discounted mega box when i was around 900 trophy lol! Pretty lucky on this game, have fun with Leon and pray they release a skin for him haha
---
Just give me pamüòî

Oh yeah what up bro? Let‚Äôs play some gem grab later on today?
---
Peeps
---
I mean it depends on the map and where they're at. He's got the range yeah but if there's a wall between em Shelly can super and take his lunch money
---
Same with Mortis
---
Piper should be top

Well, I just don‚Äôt know what to say, thank you üôèüèΩ

/woooosh

I would watch this show!
---
A power 10 jessie, power 10 pam and then 1 other brawler can easily get 6 minutes. Lots of colts or nita, Sometimes frank.

*Gene is not a girl*
---
My idea about penny star power is to replace it with the:
---
When penny normal attack hits an enemy it explodes dealing splash damage.
---
Or they can replace it with the:
---
When penny normal attack hits an enemy the bounce of her hit is doubled
---
Can confirm is real
---
*what is lancer doing here*
---
I don‚Äôt think she is. She‚Äôs a fortune teller not a mummy

This reminds me of the time I got Darryl from one of these

Yeah? Lucky bro üòÇ

Leon is just a Primo with more range

Wow that's _really cool!_

nothing to say, just amazing.

Dang, did not expect this to blow up so much! Thanks for the gold and silver! :D

Ye i was also surprised when i did it in only an hour. Honestly i was just so hyped when i got him that my drawing sped up like crazy lmao

Everytime lmaoo

Ah, I see now. It‚Äôs actually really cool!

if they see two blue dots they are duo

What about the dragon one

I keep posting because I think it‚Äôs kinda funny the amount of hate come with a post like this. Hot girl will always make a pic better, right? Dad never was around, but that‚Äôs not the point, I have my own money thanx. And no this is t it there‚Äôs more! The projector is so all the homies can watch while whoever is duking it out we can all watch together on the big screen. Stay tuned you‚Äôll see what I‚Äôm talking about.
