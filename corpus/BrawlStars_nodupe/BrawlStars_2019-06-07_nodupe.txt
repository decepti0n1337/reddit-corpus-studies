Love it, imagine the super being a cyclone and Kraken arms flailing out of it.

OMG JUST STOP DYING
---
Lol yea but I already have 15k...
---
I swear sometimes I'm doing great and think we're winning, I haven't died, but I look up at the opposing team's score and it's like 20 and I'm like WTF duuuudddesssss who keeps dyyyyinnnggg??

Keep

That barley

**Away from me**

Someone probably already saw this

*Thiccness is the right answer*

Oh yea, that is what I thought.

They should make it so that you can arrange it in any way you want right?

@gyarafish
---
*cursed x2*
---
Damn, I just commented this, didn't see it had already been done, i added kraken tentacles flailing out the whirlpool though lol
---
**This is pure art**
---
Okay heres the plan:
---
 First you have push the pedal so you go the maximum speed distance. If he catches up, then keep going like that for a few seconds, then brake the pedal to send Carl crashing into your car. Then you open your door and go up to him up close. When he throws his wrench, you immediately catch it (it moves painfully slow) and then pick carl up, and throw him on the ground. Then you beat the police to death with the wrench once they inevitably come, and then run over a couple thousand pedestrians.
---
Since you couldn't make up some stats for them I'll make em for you free of charge!Also i will refer to your character as (character)
---
Hp:6780
---
Attack:(Character)has a long range shot gun that has the same range as Bo but a smaller radius(Character)Shotgun shoot's out 8 pellets that deals 260 per pellet.
---
Super:(Character)Goes on a rampage. It swings it's stop sign that deals 1350 damage around a 3x3 area with increased movement speed.
---
Star power: After (Character)Freed themselves they have gotten very alert of their surroundings,so whenever a enemy brawler is within (character') 6x6 area (character)gains a temporary speed boost.
---
Yes I wish they made that you can arrange the robots in the way you want but if you want to make more complex things use gene since he can pull the robots
---
Poco is not that weak. He does quite well in gem grab
---
what are you talking about 😂
---
The profile picture looks like a Pokémon
---
Mortis at lvl 10 is pretty much invincible

Damn, feels bad man

True. Skins dont belong in updates supercell. They dont fill slots for content and I'm fucking sick and tired of them being the bulk of an update.

It would take an hour to find a match🙃

I didn't downvote, I'm asking how you have 23 brawlers at 5k.

yeah, that's true

Bibi: I GOT THE MOVES! I GOT THE MOVES!

Hey

Truth hurts
---
How to play Mortis in Solo:
---
1. Stalk Dynamike
---
2. Stalk 2nd Dynamike
---
3. Stalk 3rd Dynamike
---
4. Stalk the random Barley
---
5. Make them team
---
6. Piss them off using your god-like dodging skills
---
7. Gets close and runs away
---
8. Watch how the Barley burns the Powercubes
---
Me: i love u bb
---
Bibi: who tf is brawl ball
---
Yes. Good point. like OP did with shelly.

whatev its true

Poco buff!!!??

Poco was really good in 2018
---
He went
---
S I C K O M O D E
---
I dont even play siege anymore ,plus the star token isint tempting to me anymore
---
Nwmm is amazing
---
Thank you!! 😄
---
Uses super and wastes it
---
when she has her star power, oh my god she is broken
---
the *speed*. you can dodge anything, and is insane when it comes to control. the massive spread + knock back is crazy good for keeping people away from an objective such as power cubes or gems. 
---
without star power, she is decent, possibly even underwhelming
---
NANI!!
---
Nwm is amazing
---
First time I've seen Leon, he's usually in the background invisible
---
True shit

Nah mate

##Sad Rico noises
---
Ya I'm kinda lucky, I didn't say it was you but someone did
---
They need to buff poco, poor guy takes the whole game trying to break a box
---
My dumbass actually thought it said steve
---
He’s so strong that he doesn’t even jump at the enemy team with 10 gems
---
Please don’t listen to these people that say “mortis is a high skill cap brawler”. Sure you can push him, but so can power 1 brawlers. Does that mean you don’t need to upgrade your brawlers?! 
---
Truth is he is highly team reliant for most of the situations. You’re basically like a scrawny guy in a gang full of badass people who do most of the fighting and you show up at the last second to deal the finishing blow and show off “aha see how i took down the entire team, i’m so op”. 
---
With that said, he does have his moments which basically comes down to match ups such as a team full of squishes who on top being squishes make mistakes and it is these moments that mortis takes advantage of and squashes entire team. Again, quite rare. 
---
However, when it comes to 1 v 1 situation, he does struggle and for most the most part he would lose unless enemy is incredibly stupid.
---
When it comes to stats, his damage is the lowest for a melee. A level 1 bibi does more damage than maxed mortis. Has the slowest reload speed(yes, even slower than piper). He even loses the mobility game to bibi(sp) who can catch up to him even after 3 dashes. 
---
Now, people who are doing decently with mortis right now are already good from other brawlers’ skill point. And to do even better is pushing it where other brawlers dont need as much effort. And frankly, it’s not even rewarding to try and get there.
---
Accurate
---
oh, once you get piper, that changes. the speed and damage on the bullet is insane. just be good at Brock at you'll be great at piper. she is really, really good, no matter what the youtube rankings say
---
Can you wear it?
---
Poco memes are invading the subreddit
---
How do you even get that lucky
---
 Hi, can I use this clip for one of my funny moments videos? I will give you credit. This is my YT: [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJyrNfNgjwN\_B6IWAZqbWzg](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJyrNfNgjwN_B6IWAZqbWzg)
---
Poco is meme-worthy
---
It's an online game. There needs to be a punishment for people who disconnect. Otherwise you would just disconnect from a game you are going to lose and lose nothing.
---
Everyone else in a match is online and playing, why should you get points or whatever for not playing? I'm not discussing server issues, but mostly, people get disconnected because of their own internet issues.
---
There is nothing to this subject that needs to be discussed. Maybe Supercell will improve their server, maybe you will improve your internet connection... who knows
---
Megalovania

i got spike from the first box i opened after not playing for weeks on my mini so i guess this is their way to make you come back and be an active player
---
He is the chosen one

You prevailed with God!

I don't know, I didn't think I had that many, I got Tara and Mortis in the past 1 week

Leon aprove
---
OH SHIT YOUR RIGHT
---
Ok....so he’s not the best but still better than the middle of the pack. That’s far from needing a buff.
---
Keep your post titles descriptive and provide context. For instance, if your post is about an in-game suggestion your title should include a brief description of what your idea is.
---
Oh no
---
He was like 4th to last in Kairos tier list, mortis also got shafted. People say buff mortis's reload speed but what would a poco buff need?
---
i was confused and then i realized it was your teammate and i apologize for your pain
---
Screw their kids.... Jk but I hope they realize if they do ignore their "customers" enough it will eventually back fire
---
Not really a template, just a silly meme with Kairos face samples to fuel other memes. I don't think that I should be credited if people use the faces for other memes because they're just screenshots, but I don't want this reposted and I guess you could use this as a template idk lolol. If you use it as a template then maybe credit me.

They aren’t ignoring the customers, they’re just trying to make money.

In new post section there was this top upvoted post.......... Wow! 😂
---
Jeez
---
Ironic username for him
---
It takes a special someone to get lose in HayDay
---
I wouldn't mind spending money it's just my options are basically loot boxes, skins for a few Brawlers or dropping a decent wad for a brawler especially a legendary idk I feel there could be a better way to do it
---
'But it's too confusing for new players'
---
Wich?
---
Yeah drop rates are pretty tough for a few people, but I mean, getting those legendary brawlers are supposed to be rare. I wouldn’t be surprised if this was actually meant to make money, and I would not blame them if so, they’re a 100% free company and they need to be able to market somehow

Not gonna ask bout Shelly but why the fork is crow trophy road in this XD

Fix what? Matchmaking is based off brawler trophies, I’d say that was a fair match. I mean, I get they had star power, but I think it’s still fair

When you lose to much at UNO its time you place a card with nothing on it so you make the call on what card it is.

Oh, whoops. Which brawlers have you not done

I actually play a lot of siege, got around 200 trophies on 3 different champions so I really don't get this meme. You just need to understand which of them are stronger.

It worked for them,why not me!

How long you took to get all this:)

Wow another person who still has the ricochet flair. You, me and op still have it lol.
---
Barley and Dymamike not metally and temmers
---
It's not a repost, just there was a meme template

I feel like Morris is more balanced with his current star power, but if there were multiple star powers then this would be a nice addition

Ditto on noobs in 4K. Took a 6 month break after hitting 4K before release of brawlstars. Just stared this week and climbed 600trophies in a day without a loss. So many reckless plays and unbalanced decks.

I agree and disagree. It doesn't have a place in duo showdown but it's almost required in heist

But I used him at sd and got 500+ before the mini poco buff

Yep im a Poco in solo
---
Me too
---
Wouldn't say he is good in sd, but in brawl ball he is nuts. Being able to easily hit two enemies with one attack means your super charges so much faster.

With gene you can play with randoms and he’s just a better gem carrier, bounty hunter, siege player, and brawl ball player than poco

That feeling when you're fucked.

BEST SKIN EVER! (totally not cuz im a terraria fanboy)

Tbh i think primo is not weak. I pushed him with level 6 to 500. If you have at least a bit of skill you can play him easy and dont cry he would be weak just because you cant play him. Same for poco.
---
F
---
yep
---
If you are close to him and you see his attack animation, dash trough him and you will not get hit. Same for super

Forgot to put on "humor"

I’ve never liked Brawl Ball, anyway. I’m totally in the camp of reworking Brawl Ball and Siege, or just replacing them with something else.

I typically skip them both and just play Showdown over and over. 🤷🏻‍♂️

how the heck did you get **NEGATIVE** 5532 gems? Thats like negative 300 dollars!

Lol....give buff to bibi in her attack speed

- Go on the subreddit home

- tap the tree dots in the upper right corner
---
- tap on change user flair
---
You can do it in every subreddit that has flairs
---
3 legendaries in normal boxes. The thing is that having purchased Phoenix Crow makes me p2w :(
---
Ok, so just go to the brawl stars reddit's home page and then click "community options" under the white box that says 174k brawlers, 1.6k brawling. After you do theat click "add flair" and then select your brawler. 
---
Hope this helps!
---
Still good but definitely not broken. Also good in showdown and far easier to use than crow.
---
How can it be toxic, when you don't have teammates for spinners to enrage?
---
Just looks like plastic.
---
I think that istead of bouncing away,the ball should just stop right before getting inside the goal because if it will bounce,unfair strategies will be created

Um.. no he doesn't

At 200 cups you can do well with ANY brawler
---
RUSH HIMMMMMMMMMMMM!
---
.2 at the least, he needs a range buff so he can have a higher pick rate.
---
Love it!!!!
---
😊
---
Thank you too!
---
I do watch. But remember, he is one of the best player in the world and have an organized team with top tier players as well. Using his skill to apply to the general player base is really stupid. And it doesn't change the fact that Piper is one of the worst choice in BB, her weakness is very obvious (low HP, insanely long reload speed, most useless in close range and goal line defense, she has really low DPS which killing all of those tanks is the real issue)
---
Perfect.
---
Bull:time to shine

Nice! But why do you hate her? 😂

This is dope I could see it being a poster concept

Criw? Still an X in the corner?

Dick?
---
Love ur art!! 👌🏻👌🏻
---
Poco is actually decent since BB is a very agressive mode and Poco's best in an agressive team which have those tank to keep healing them. Mortis is kinda bad mostly because of his slow reload speed
---
r/engrish

Thx!!😄😄😄

r/english

Thanks I appreciate that 😘

A friendly reminder this is a shovelware game.  
---
Mortis has a shovel.
---
I love plants and I was especting to love her.
---
And well I don’t like close range brawler to begin with, but unlike bibi which was well balanced day one, She was really overpowered when first introduced, and still is in the top 3-5 😅
---
Must be the disappointment of the perfect skin with a style that I does not like 🤷‍♂️
---
( she’s my only brawler under 300 😅)
---
Well, I got 2 legends
---
You deserve the upvote:)
---
Btw I also have spike but at 4755 I only need Frank and Crow to get the rest of the brawlers

Bull is another story or even primo crow or piper

it's fair since mega box doens't give me nothing

Congrats! And "mustard enough courage" is one way to say brave enough to post but hay I'm not judging, great art too! Its oh so true on what happens in gem grab.

Yeah, that's what I was thinking - but it might stop people from trying to exploit the really narrow areas.
---
Hm
---
Thanks for doing the maths, sounds like a bug in the time system
---
No better estate than Free real estate.
---
If you rearrange players it spells replays
---
Brawlers...ASSEMBLE
---
I like the crow idea, but even better: How about his poison heals HIMSELF half the damage per tick when poison is active on an enemy. This would offset crows low health.
---
It wouldn't be so cringey without the title.
---
Why did you steal?
---
Dude is a great ideea!
---
If it hits the edge of the map, it should bounce instead of just stopping imo
---
I don't like reposts
---
No I just checked you have nothing to do with this skin and if anything looks to be you have stolen post
---
For THOSE GUYS that like to screw over others because they nothing better to do.
---
I always get star player as poco lmao
---
Camps all game and 3rd parties the last 2 people

Still goes to hell

Is it a lobber *barley and dynamike flashbacks*
---
What’s your username?
---
He's trying to be tough but he's just adorable
---
Yes i did
---
I'm new, how do I unlock legendarys?
---
Is that your Chinese homework in the background lol
---
Idk
---
i’M tOo gOoD!
---
Pretty sure the one that is getting ashamed is you.
---
Bruh
---
THANK YOU!
---
Colored versión?? Love it!!
---
That is the shortest enemy Rosa range I've seen
---
Icewizard?
---
No I didn’t
---
Stop fucking complaining, I’m at 5200 trophies and just got my first Mythic today. Haven’t gotten a legendary still
---
CUBERS UNITA *cough* I MEAN UNITE
---
THIS ARTWORK IS STOLEN!!
---
I hope so, but I still need 100 power points to upgrade my... &gt;!shelly!&lt;
---
Her face do
---
i love this Xd
---
Hah, his son)
---
What if you! Wanted leon? But Mega box said: trash
---
Sure looks good btw
---
The difference in that is that Mortis is the only one who can’t fight back when running away
---
Buff mortis
---
At least give the link to the god-damn creator!
---
That your clan sucks?
---
Such a cute and true Text and then you have to take the creepiest pic of poco you could have found ?
---
Rosa was a mistake from the start
---
The second Piper one is a good idea because it’s too easy for enemies to move under her when she jumps up, and Piper has no way of changing direction once she’s up in the air
---
I don’t do random duos.  Only when my bro wants to or someone from my club invites me.  Poco in duos with a range or tank friend is good fun
---
I’ve bought crow, Tara and Pam in the shop and also bought around 20 Megaboxes currently. I’m at 5.3k with all brawlers.😊👍🤗
---
is that a godzilla reference?
---
Wasn't it, "I'm sugar and spice."
---
Thanks
---
I actually had time to google it
---
Ye that would be a big oof, but i already have all brawlers and leon maxed out. He’s not that good xD
---
He said that he wantt the replay of the mmatch to be at 100 or 200 trophie not 400
---
É nois
---
Ikr :)
---
Nightmare
---
Thankyou! There should be an option to turn off those offers
---
Ok
---
Randomly in boxes
---
Where?
---
Dynis vs MortMike ? Lol
---
?
---
I know, i slowly improving the pasta
---
Pretty decent I would say
---
Shes still op
---
You thought you had me cornered, _El Primo_. But you forgot about my stand ablility 「ＢＬＡＣＫＰＯＲＴＡＬ」who specializes in close range combat and looks like you’re within range.
---
ゴ
---
  ^ゴ
---
        ^ゴ
---
Heyyyy
---
Good
---
I actually looked it up bro
---
Buff mortis :v
---
SANS WANTS TO KNOW ATHENA'S LOCATION
---
this is so true
---
Yes I will but it will take me quite some time, and I don't know if it's that necessary since Brawl Stars can't have reference to other games. But don't worry, I'm gonna do it for Art's sake!
---
I think 100 Star Tokens is a bit too much, but I see why you made it like that. I remember seeing a very old post about the same idea but to unlock the Mega Box, you will need 5 "Gem Tokens". These can be obtained by winning a Ticket Event. So it would basically take 5 weeks to get a Mega Box.
---
yeah
---
100th comment: great idea
---
he indeed can. " I am a crow main"
---
Well if you stop to question it, you’re a goner.
---
Is that THE KairosTime?!? If so, amazing work man, you beat him!
---
Dude one day my colt went from to 426 to 330 :/ (today he is at 445 trophies)
---
I think Mortis needs a buff more then Poco
---
Are the traffic cones on the side for penny’s cannon 😂
---
Im The frend of pery can you say to supercell that the skin comes in Brawl stars
---
Put a hat on this Mortis
---
They actually are and btw my Instagram is jakey2506 and I’ll post more concepts there!
---
I honestly don’t know what you are talking about. This has nothing to do with this post.
---
Ahhh, yes. Terraria. I remember the good ol' days...
---
Damn, *BROCK GOT FRIENDZONED*
---
Same, and I still play it by now
---
Ikr same with showdown, too many spots for bull or el primo to Bush camp
---
Ehh, *details*
---
Goes to next demon.
---
“You’re not on the list”
---
“Yeah, of course. In Brawl Ball, I kick the ball at my own goal!”
---
Вууххх
---
You are a very in likable person
---
I think they should make an option for you to not be featured on Brawl TV, and you could get matched up with other people like that. Just so there's no public shaming. Maybe even blurring names would seem like a good option.
---
Poco?
---
Wait, you meant free powercube?
---
For anyone wondering yes I made the skin
---
Pretty much everyone else with more than 1 legendary has spend alot of money on the game. Atleast you have everyone else.
---
Omae wa mou shindeiru
---
Put me in the screenshot with my name marked out like a sandwich
---
I no got a legendary
---
(My account is from my brother but it is linked to my cell phone *-*)
---
You can't make this, because the box is already ,,open'', although the animation shows a closed chest.
---
r/bettereveryloop
---
Spike is cancer or psycho
---
That’s honestly crazy. I’ve been playing as long as you too. What brawlers are you missing?
---
PINGAZ
---
_Laughs in high health_
---
420th upyoter
---
Ngl this fits better.
---
Darryl😍
---
exactly what you need, exactly when you need it
---
# Always &lt;3
---
Oh yeah, boss fight. It's very fun to play, however, the rewards aren't that worth it, unless you're high up in the challenges.
---
Gedi-kor....i am following you :D
---
XD
---
The rocks speak to me
---
First off, money
---
If every brawler was as easy to get as a rare, no one would spend money on new brawlers. Supercell is a company and has to make money. Also characters range in unique powers the higher the rarity they are
---
Yeah. I really like piper but it’s annoying getting tenth places in showdown pretty often
---
Basically this. they could change it, but it probably wouldn’t be worth the trouble.
---
Your "defense" was making up and assuming things, which is stupid. I don't see any point on discussing with a teenager with low self steem. Anyways, your post isn't important and nobody cards about it, so keep replying and posting the same, you will be the same kid with insecurities and the game will be the same.
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
3 months is nothing
---
Me: *runs with the gems I collected*
---
Everyone at the jewlert store:
---
Make a new account.
---
Then add team in the training cave
---
You keep telling yourself I’m the one with insecurities, you’re the one who called a 17 year old “pathetic and stupid” while they tried to hold a respectful debate with you.
---
Bad skills*
---
Sorry I'm missing something
---
Cause right now is energy drink showdown
---
Before looking at comments, I thought it was normal to get a legendary at 350 and another at 2000
---
Yeni 1 tane hesap açmıştım ilk oyunu oynadım adamlar bottan beter oynuyolar merak ettim adamların profili bi baktık şok
---
Yea the persons can just team while that one person sits in a corner waiting for draw or trophie loss
---
SMH yeah it is
---
No dying allowed here
---
Rosa and Carl’s are the absolute worst.
---
Why is chelly the donkey
---
It takes a very, very *special* person to play Rosa in brawl ball.
---
We are making games, and my friend said to me "Your weapon drawings look like brawl stars character icons."    
---
so i shared it here :)
---
That’s not going in his video
---
Now, make the trident a pickaxe, and enchant it so that it comes back.
---
**and that's a FACT**
---
Is mortis a joke to you?
---
Yeah i mute my phone
---
exactly me in combat
---
100 is too much how about making 25 tokens?
---
Mcd's would be proud
---
r/blessedimages
---
I downvoted to get Leon
---
;-;
---
No, it’s part of the game
---
I'm pretty sure you just get everything rewarded to you without you seeing the animation of opening the boxes.
---
Damn it, I don't like teamers but I love dick! Now I'm conflicted...
---
Dynamax shelly
---
r/cursedimages
---
What I don’t get it
---
Thanks for dying and dropping the 10 gems
---
{Teams in a lot of languages}
---
I’m sorry but this doesn’t make sense. If you want details just tell me
---
I mostly agree, and thank you for taking the time to type this all out. Hopefully Supercell sees!
---
Get downvoted
---
Default Brock: Am I a joke to you?
---
Im at 500 ive been playing since decemember i gpt both spile and like spike at around 2000-3000+ and i got leon at 5000
---
This* supercell gotta ban these guy.
---
I feel anxious just watching this
---
At least you understand
---
I can feel the cancer emitting off of this post
---
I thought ninja only played fortnite BUT NOW I can destroy him
---
Did you Photoshop the text or did you hit a fucken secret GOD mode button?
---
Already have crow and Leon, so I’m downvoting to see if I can get spike
---
He's a skeleboi, it's all good
---
Mortis in siege
