Now shelly needs a nerf bc of band aid
---
---
---
This has been done 80 times. Also low effort.
---
Is it just me or is Shelly‚Äôs conquering the game right now? Each match I‚Äôm always against one and solo showdown has about 5-6 every game wth.
---
He looks like a carrot
---
im in part 4 lol
---
Thanks for paying so much attention on my posts
---
*Fornite dance*
---
A soul for a soul
---
Good, i thought you were still in part 1 and i didn't wanna spoil you of dio appearing again in part 3
---
Pharaoh Frank, and he should lost his nose
---
Guys I'm shaking
---
Yea!
---
Hilarious bro!
---
Now this is definetly a skin i would buy if i had leon. And they need to change brawler icons when you have skin.
---
Go brawl go,Go brawl go!!!!!!
---
i mean i don't really now if he's dead?
---
I wish this would happen to me instead of everyone playing bush survivor until the smoke reaches the center
---
I love the art style!!
---
OMFG exactly!!!! Frank's problem isn't his health, it's the fact that if u go around the Frank very closely and u arent so squishy the Frank is pretty much dead and he has well... ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. The only tanky brawler that if u get close to him u can kill him with most of the brawlers in the game. With him "stops walking while attacking and super" and the super and attack delay mechanic which are necessary for him so he won't be OP, I think the only way to buff him is to delete him from the game
---
He is, and for good, although he appears again in part 6 as a flashback, that's all in gomna say
---
oh alright.
---
Super cool and cute, but they're siblings
---

---
Still upvote tho cuz I love fanart
---
Omfg I didn‚Äôt realize that we needed this
---
Now if only he had fought like that in showdown...
---
Tell me this guy is trolling
---
Actually it's penny
---
F
---
There is and honestly its annoyong 
---
Lots of games have bad Matchmaking ok? 
---
We are playing a game devlopers worked hard for and here are the kids complaing about Shelly and no skins for some brawlers
---
Its hard to get all those things in 1 update

Not gonna lie, this is my favorite user made skin.

40% is overused and 60% is so wrong

Do not get tricked by his innocent face

Hahah thanx dude!!!

Don't bring me CR flashbacks please...

guys, I‚Äôm shaking

U best be rdy to get to 12k if you want ur next mega box it's painful.

Thank you \^\^

---
Piper snappy sniping is counter to this dumb starpower
---
Congrats. I'm only missing Crow
---
Step 1: dont point blank a colt
---
Is this yours?
---
It's clear you haven't battled nor played shelly: her super charging is OverPowered. She just uses super, than regular, then she regains her super, uses it AGAIN, etcetera. She can deal ~5K damage with each, making a total of 15K+ damage. Assuming Frank, Mortis and Spike have 7500, 5320, and 3000 hp, they will be blown to ^bits. If there are any survivors, the colt will attack em. **Assuming they were close to making a goal**, if they had already scored that's a different story.
---
But he was with energy drink, way faster.
---
I need more karma so I can post more brawl stars memes. Good fan art btw
---
I thought first when i saw spike but i never drawed it and this is in lwarb stars
---
You are the enemy of the people
---
Was i the only one who thought of DIO rather than Crow the first they saw this...?
---
Yeah
---
This is a good idea but I think you can add jumpers on sides to get in as diferent way to retake center against Sniper + support teams.
---
Hey look it's connected from my hero academia
---
Gamemode?
---
They are fucking noobs
---
Aren't they synonymous (in brawl stars)?
---
I always let everyone else kill each other first. Makes the whole thing easier.
---
Nevermind the mega boxes. I can't wait to get 150 coins as a reward for reaching 14500!

Look at a crow then look at crow

They have good offense but a horrible defense if the enemy knows how to juke

Oh ya shiiit

I have seen this on devices of many youtubers.... Probably it is because of the big size of your screen.

Haha stolen

i would buy it, and i did. its worth the skin is really nice
---
That's why she put the 8 ball there
---
why
---
First of all, we all knew what they meant by ‚ÄúAuto fire‚Äù. Second of all, stop trying to be bratty and trying to counter something they said. It‚Äôs both useless and undeniably annoying. Your comment already has 4 downvotes.
---
My dream is to work with them and then have my house decorated like this!
---
Very satisfying to watch you killed the 1st crow :) nice shot there
---
I lov e it
---
Robo Mike is OP
---
The only Dynamike who managed to kill everyone without teaming
---
This is basically how much Spike does in one shot
---
Where she lost her pants?
---
Is this in SandBox?
---
Lwarb
---
r/cursedbrawlstars
---
U using lwarb?
---
I have that too
---
I believe you, I‚Äôm just having a hard time figuring this out from a programming perspective. I think your on to something where mines have their own unique identifier and that‚Äôs what is targeted by the star power. It‚Äôs just kinda weird that every other star power, to my knowledge, is locked to its firing type wether it‚Äôs a regular attack or super and this one isn‚Äôt. It just seems inconsistent.
---
Watch this https://youtu.be/csegCSxWGcU
---
***o god o fuk***
---
I can sense the sarcasm üòÇ
---
Looks like a mummy to me
---
Lwarb? I have that

u can‚Äôt tell cause they‚Äôve never done it before so there‚Äôs nothing stopping them from removing it

Looks like one of those Egyptian stone warriors. Cool!

Who accidentally upgrades a brawler?

I like that crow background

And also it‚Äôs called a fail for a reason..

Can these posts just stop.

how did u do this

What IOS is if running?

That would be too hot. I can't handle that

????? you mad cause you got a new brawler??????????
---
take your upvote and get out of the 12000+ home

That coloring took way longer than like the whole animation

Really saying i havent seen one

true

earth bending?

I was once a fan of the like Leon and Nita are siblings Theorie but I changed my mind

Me: \*Sees this\*

Me: ITS TIME TO WORK AT SUPERCELL

this convinced me :)
---
Yes please
---
Beautiful
---
Every brawler has a blue background when you unlock him.
---

---
I believe it‚Äôs an exploit
---
Yea but I missed the major one
---
I hate those people
---
It's inspiring... Here's a new star power: penny's turret NOW shoot in a straight line Just like jessie's one (obviously it can't shoot over walls)
---
Now he a pillar man
---
This is a very controversial topic: Frank might feel like a beast in the 0-600 range, but above that, if you can play well enough you should be able to avoid him (yes, if you are good you can do that in ranges below 600). After 600 he just gets countered top easily by band aid shelly and potentially newly meteor rush El Primo. He needs a buff, not a nerf. Try to learn how to play against him! :)
---
The first time i heard that voiceline, i thought she was saying: "Watch it, turd!"
---
Awesome drawing btw
---
The change of trajectory
---
I wish I could give you an award üò•
---
Cursed AND Repost.
---
The enemy will instantly drop the ball to prevent themselves from accidental self-scoring

I'm shaking I'm literally fucking shaking because it's so damn cold in my room
---
10/10
---
aww thanks man, honestly didn‚Äôt expect to get any.. you saying that is good enough for me :)
---
Man imagine getting two afk teammates...
---
i don't know what, but I know i'd love to see more things involving the members of the subreddit. FNF in the server is fun, but 1: you need to be in the server, and 2: it's only in-game.
---
nice
---
i think ur right
---
Life...
---
Throwers are going to be the new shelly on that map
---
I feel u m8
---
Yeah, but without super you can just walk to him and close kill him because he can't even run and attack. He needs buff.
---
is that a new skin?
---
Same thing with skins, people asking for legendaries, that‚Äôs all I see on YouTube and it makes me feel bad üò≠
---
the frame numbers are still part of the file name, anyway
---
good to know but check out my other maps
---
I personally like them
---
This is true art
---
I mean you're technically correct, but some corrections are so insigificant to the conversation that several people get bothered by it and downvote (like the grammsr nazi). But yeah times are tough
---
Great game btw
---
Ah c mammo
---
Cactopi
---
R E P O S T
---
Who got star player
---
is this real because i looked on my game and it wants there sooo
---
That's so stupid. I rarely do this as the stronger brawler but when I do I execute them upon seeing a slight hint of "betrayal"
---
Never took that kind of L.
---
Seems unecessary
---
Awesome but so similiar to the default skin
---
Something that I think would be very useful is if you could find a way to have comments made by an official Brawl Stars team account on a post (the ones that get marked with a Supercell Response flair) automatically pinned at the top of the comments to find them a little easier. Which I guess would mean that whatever comment it is they were replying to would get to the top but yeah
---
Yes
---
*What is point hunters?*
---
Cuz he's soooooo weak it's so ez to dodge his shots when ur close to him,he can't walk while he attack or super, and there's a delay in his attack and even bigger delay in his super
---
I‚Äôm hunting every crow I can find with Bibi
---
Just 9,500 trophies?
---
Wtf are you saying. The shelly does this amount of damage when you are exactly next to her. When she respawns there is a distance between her and the brawlers who are about to score. Create the image in your mind, in that range she will probably do max 1200 damage and not even to all of them. They will get the knockback and lose the ball however they will probably catch it and score.
---
I don‚Äôt understand

I mean, cool that you have both star powers, but slick boots doesn‚Äôt do shit. I always use magnum special. Slick boots needs a buff or rework to be even remotely viable.

Not broken at all

I'm on 6900 trophies and I got every single brawler but Spike. The legendary that I actually wanted. Darn Spike I was cursed with Leon instead

i like how bibi voice line sound so different like when she says ‚Äúoh my gosh‚Äù in a seductive way and then second later she says ‚Äúcool it‚Äù like someone who just dropped their lunch on the ground

Dark elixir. You use it to buy and level up heroes who defend your base, as well as train and upgrade dark elixir troops.

Yup

Ok

Supercell: tries to make us happy giving brawlers a creative skin and not just a obligatory ski

But you got Crow ! And you delete the game

Yeah in my club a guy named ‚Äúleon and crow‚Äù got all three legendaries (he had 2k trophies btw)

It looks very much that they belong to the same club. So, Barley and Brock came along with this 533 trophy Bull as fixed team, not as randoms.

Toxicity of players in brawl brawl is just awful . People ruining the game by throwing into there net . Somemany try hard noobs spinning and missing a trick shot and much more
---
Because I just wanted to...

I don't think this is a good idea
---
I colored it with Ibis Paint X
---
That's Amazing .... congrats bro...

I dont like Siege
---
How did you get internal audio allowed on Android?!
---
if they made the two required goals to win the game then I don't see how they aren't the star player
---
I got 4000 just now i dont have pam,crow or spike

wat du u mean

Maybe Leon is a female

Definitely need more strategy/ tips and tricks for players. Would especially like to have overall discussions over brawlers like how they may interact with eachother.

I'd like to stay informed about the official news without being flooded by shit posts and bragging posts. Would be great if those would be grouped in Megathreads or something.

---
If you want to get upvoted that much, then upload something that isnt a normal play
---
Ok agressive idout. Everyone has a mistake idout
---
The game doesn't factor in goals for the star player
---
This is some real shit right here
---
I‚Äôve been here since global
---
#T O R R E T
---
Who else has her super sound play in their head when you saw this?
---
There are 8 band-aid shellies with supers defending.
---
Sry for the bad quality....... The hoodie over leon has 2 breathing nostrils which shrink and enlarge(try rotating leon slowly you'll see)
---
So you steal his time/fun instead? Makes perfect sense.
---
Torret
---
if "all they did" was score goals and still got star player then that is demonstrably false
---
No one shaking? Good.
---
Yes! I was reminded of that too :)
---
But what if he has super and energy drink?
---
Great. Love it
---
Tq
---
I love this! The rock band concept is also perfect for the skins
---
What do you mean?
---
While I'm still struggling for a legendary at 14k
---
Pennys mortar‚Äôs name is lenny

But what if....LEON IS ALREADY GIRL!

Me too. But the thing is I dont have any mythic nor legendary, so I cannot push anymore since Im gonna lose it.
---
ohh you're right. I didn't think about that
---
ur mums bush
---
This sucks
---
Maby they also want to hide the absolute terrible AI of Mortis, Leon and Gene bots

I didn't mind it when I had it but now I have the p30 with emui 9.1 and the software has gone downhill

Me and it was a nightmare for me lol

But u got fricking leon

I didn't coach cory did

Yes, a lot! Its on the floor now

Jaja, Just a prank, she was in the team with the other random

Yes my fellow wooden droideka
---
El Primo was in a Bush,Turrets cannot see brawlers in Bush,Same goes with Penny's mortar,Jessie's turret,Nita's bear and Pam's healing station.
---
Is this island invasion
---
Say right sike now
---
sen kimsin o√ß
---
Sorry can't remember you :(
---
But brawlers can still move if they are affected by her super. They cannot attack anyway.
---
He meant solo showdown. He is terrible there
---
IT'S EL FRIMO, OR PRANK... wtf is just wrote.
---
When you use the super on the panicking Shelly and use it on her again because you hit her teammates by accident
---
And repeat the cycle for the whole match...
---
And that's how I won 47-15 in Bounty with Frank

Mmmmmmmm

Yeah, and then find out that your 9 gems pocho died and find out that you are flying in the enemy base. Nice
---
This is called having a brain. You don‚Äôt need to be a goalie to know how to stop simple shots and predictions

I get my revenge as Shelly by chasing Mortis all over the map with my Super, focusing on him only until he is dead

Nah they usually have like 10

See I was waiting for a comment like this. I know plenty of people who have a brain but don‚Äôt know the game of soccer. People don‚Äôt think to pass, they don‚Äôt think to hold onto the ball at the right time and shoot instead, and they think that just by moving side to side will stop a goal. It takes some knowledge to be good at brawl ball and this is why a lot of people complain.

Ike sike spike like

No!

First things first, this post is almost 3 months old.

Second, what do you mean by "SF"?

Where MMA Russia?

I shred with tick. You got to know how to use him and his super well
---
No, not really

How many shakers on this one?
---
Meet Up section would be cool to find new players to play and climb together with. GL everyone and may the luckiest win!

Fair enough, the title was really supposed to be a Stephen Colbert reference üòÑ
---
Why do people ship him with nita? Wtf they are brother and sister
---
This bullshit is not even remotely funny
---
Or named suprememasterkyle69 just for having leon

Thats that meteor sweat

Ok play with me and ill carry you in chill cave gem  grab with tick. I got rank 20 tick

i think crow is ok right now, though i wouldnt mind if he got a small buff.

Sounds great. Also, no, I don't have discord.

Friend advice, don't pause to see the "glitching" frames
---
Stolen, we can clearly see the original watermark on the right
---
Wtf
---
I know it's not hard to hear sarcasm but it hard to see sarcasm
---
Because they can‚Äôt give us brawl talks all the time. They have to set-up and such. Also they need the update ready to show. Just wait until they‚Äôre ready.
---
I opened 160 box this morning nothing !!! I have 9 level 10 and 9 level 9 they are 22 star power to get !!!!!
---
Okey wtf
---
MMA russia helps you
---
yeah hes actually good
---
On app store. That means made by supercell. Go take a look, and also there is even a post here on this subreddit just go to r/brawlstars and search "leon and nita are brother and sister:
---
Or photoshoped
---
Cam ne znayu
---
Good drawing, meh meme... with an overused joke.
---
Usualy i cant even find them on yt
---
it is not as game changing as his other sp
---
Hen I read the title I thought that this would be serious, ut these are just some brawler stereotypes
---
The system doesn‚Äôt favour people who spend a lot of time on the game like you... but I suppose when they do their metrics you are in the minority. Those in the same bracket as you I would think would already be spending to power up their brawlers or have started way earlier than you. 
---
This is how they‚Äôve chosen to monetise the game and though not perfect I think it‚Äôs less p2w than many other games so I‚Äôm not complaining too much. I‚Äôve had far worse experiences with other games
---
No biggie
---
It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm doing anything but a classic post-lift ice cream binge
---
I‚Äôm ashamed to be in no gang because of you

Looks good, but the unzipped hoodie wasn't necessarily....... still a good drawing tho

Give me a meme idea, I really need
---
Hater...
---
El Pollo
---
Maybe if the community didn‚Äôt spam ‚ÄúBrawl talk‚Äù they would
---
i though it will be useless but its actually useful u can disguise as tick and run into a brawler and kill them
---
I'm assuming the green dots are supposed to be launch pads, but you cannot get out of the center. or you better have darryl,bull primo, crow, or piper.
---
Not really
---
Why?
---
Weird physics
---
^yes
---
Because everyone knows its time
---
Dynamikes tho
---
well done bro . bibi is one of the best brawlers in game    i was suprised when they didn't nerfed her in the last balance ... i think she should get nerfed she has been the top 5 brawler in almost every gamemode
---
Cool! Two of amazing redditor collab!
---
This is such a good representation of this game right now.
---
No this maps garbage
---
Yep
---
I do it all the time as Primo.
---
Press  B for bruh moment
---
Original leon was a god
---
r/emojipolice
---
Okay, my El Primo meme is shit, but why only my post?
---
Id say Bibi and Frank is the best brawler in Siege
---
&gt; Also, when a "weak" player gets the drink and he's able to kill someone who had a good match up to this point, that just shity ballancing.
---
I would argue not giving the weaker/losing player the ability to counter play is worse. Comeback mechanics exist in other games and those games are way more balanced than brawl stars.
---
GOD THAT LEON WAS ME!!!!!!! DAMNNNNNN
---
Hahagdhahhahsjah
---
Tick be like
---
Boom!! Very nice
---
Coming from the brawler that takes zero skill to be good with. Does that make her a good brawler?
---
Purple  has 6 letters and so doesn't update. That's basically the connection you should be making. Didn't we learn last update that the random color they say doesn't mean the type of brawler?
---
Really like it!!
---
Very cool, but the real question is ... why?
---
Why did my panties just get wetter?
---
Czech Republic.
---
It's really sad! There could've been so many good second SPs for him... but no, we get a sad half-buff that will do next to nothing in showdown.
---
Like, come on- poison life leech maybe??
---
He has the reaction timing of a potato to that energy drink
---
This idea is actually pretty good!  If you ask me, the second map name is great. I'd rename the first map to "Frantic Field"
---
he was joking
---
Very cool. Much wow üêï

A monthly contest with new maps, skins and/or gamemodes.
---
A new dynamic like that will properly increase the community contact with supercell, The monthly winner will get his map/skin/gamemode included in the game and his Brawlstars user could get starpoints or gems.
---
Note: The gamemode could be a unique ticket event or a regular event but gamemode winner will not be frequent.
---
No... just no
---
Now say spike right
---
Why do people think that star power is so bad? Using crow in the right way allows for Carrion Crow to really shine. That extra damage can really stack up when you need it to.  It also doesn‚Äôt hurt that it‚Äôs still miles better than extra toxic. I feel all the negativity stems from lex‚Äôs strong opinion, all I‚Äôm gonna say is look at it from a personal perspective and let‚Äôs wait a little more to see how it fits into the game. Hey, maybe I‚Äôm wrong. I‚Äôll wait and see!
---
The most OP SP in game, hands down
---
Is Leon not good
---
I guess thats a little better name and Thx :)
---
That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs called a ‚Äúscare crow‚Äù
---
I mean not to brag but I‚Äôm ok at showdown with tick
---
This is a very good ideas supercell should do
---
why are you making this a a big deal? multiple emojis look bad why make fun of him/her for using emojis?
---
r/technicallythetruth
---
They need to reduce this spread on his mines and give him a health boost. There's too many brawlers that can 2 shot him.
---
Have none at 17k but it‚Äôs not about the trophies if you have a legendary or not.
---
If thosd 8 have any brain whatsoever, they attack same time and crush heist in seconds
---
Not true, so... ‚¨áÔ∏è
---
Hahaha XD Comunque ti chatto in priva

Make me laugh, this does.

I would love to see something like 'What We Were Up To This Week?' which is on Clash Royale's subreddit come into life onto Brawl Star's subreddit by developers.

You're welcome

Ikr
---
b r u h m o m e n t
---
You can grab power cubes trought walls?
---
So what you are really saying is that Tick is a touch too technical for you.  
---
Yeah I hear that.  He's a tough woman's hero... not really for you, Jack.
---
The people complaining about the people complaining about brawl talk are more annoying than the people actually complaining about brawl talk. Change my mind.
---
It's a good idea thou
---
Your making it a big deal dude. The radius for picking up cubes is HUGE. You just saw it right there lol.
---
He doesn't need one
---
Minor changers? I don't see any difference
---
Here in Brazil have so many noobs called "El Gato" those guys doesn't even play right, there are also too many "Agus"
---
Yes but if the party leader chooses band-aid for the Shellys
---
I'm like: All my friends with 2K already have Leon, I'm 7K and I'm still missing 2 mythics and 3 legendaries, this is so bullshit, but my man i see that some 11K players are struggling to get all epics....
---
Late reply but Penny would be nice
---
I don‚Äôt even have a legendary and I‚Äôve been playing since beta... D:
---
Poor Mortis, he doesn‚Äôt have anyone to talk with
---
r/shittybrawlstars
---
you aren't a newbie anymore with the 7k trophy range even if you have played 4 months ago and for the actual post barley is better than both dynamike and tick and he is the only thrower that mortis can't kill easily you just need to practice on him and you will find that he is annoying wether on attack or defense and if you are not playing heist with him use the super for area control
---
Still not knowing seemed wrong to me, so?

Do u guys want comics instead?

Never said that, just curious

Oh no! He's hot!

Im now away from that game for over 1 Year! Still no 2.2?! *Damn.*
---
This isn't related to Brawl Stars.
---
Slick Boots is jealous
---
Hey, I didn't say it was the *worst* second star power!
---
(Sad Gene noises)
---
Seriously, can they not give him a SP that he can actually use on his own? :(
---
Niko?
---
Because all it does is add damage .. what are the other benefits, lol?
---
For what it's worth, I think you convinced me to spend the gems I had saved on it. Mostly because I love Crow and his first SP is practically useless anyway.
---
Well i'm still higher and i also got all 3 legendarys, but yea, i feel bad for the people who are on over 10k and don't have a legendary and it's not like you're better than others if you got a legendary, it just means you're lucky or have spent real money, that's why i don't understand the people who brag about their legendary on a few thousand trophies, it just pisses off the people who are on 10k+ and didn't got any legendarys
---
millions of people according to brawl stars youtube channel and this subreddit and also twitter comments
---
Soooooo.. why the most people like brawl
---
They are lovers.
---
Other that a buff to his mines' blast radius (by maybe 1/3 tile), Tick doesn't need a buff. In fact, if you don't play him Snake Praire, he's amazing. I pushed him to 500 trophies in a day. The most balanced newly-released brawler since as far as I've been playing.
---
"I now crown, King of Brawl Stars to PoopyTangerine."
---
But it says "great" right there
---
Jk, i know, he is my favorite brawler and his 1st star power wasn't really good, but i had hope that he gets a good 2nd sp and now that he got one, it also isn't really good, probably good on some situations, but hey, i didn't got it so i coulden't try it, so it could be better than i think it is
---
Like 999
---
what a legend!
---
Because he poison and hit me
---
I'd like less overused memes in this subreddit
---
Its was an account called something like "Kairoswifebilover" or somthing and he talked in detailm about fucking kairoses wife.
---
No fucking clue how it got 5 silvers
---
New rarity
---
WowüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
THANK YOUUU
---
He was an account about uaving sex with kaiores wife with only one comment,yeah it was in detail.
---
Definaitly not silver worthy

That legs are thicc..
---
Bro, you're on Reddit, you will never walk alone
---
Okayyyyyyyyyy
---
El Primo: I don't know what you heard about me... *rips off shirt*
---
How is that even possible.
---
the most fun for me is frank with his super there is no such joy more than stunning the enemy and see them spam auto aim on super while you kill them and they can't do anything other than getting stunned again and again XD
---
Looks like a great game
---
Poor batman..
---
It was March , with the Carl update
---
say spike right now
---
just wait for the next update it will come in two weeks
---
That bounce at the end could've NEVER happen to me.
---
You have 12k trophies, and your profile pic is crow, right?
---
And then die with 10 crystals  XD
---
Well the best thing is that you recognized your mistake.
---
Nope haven‚Äôt unlocked him looks like I‚Äôm the wrong person :|
---
Epic or new rarity
---
Truly a sight to behold
---
If I jump on the silver trail I will be downvoted to oblivion
---
Same reason I don't have any legendaries and mythics lol
---
They will not get nerfed
---
Most fun i had in BS was crow on Island Invasion at low trophies.

Wait why? I was serious

Supercell just hates asians .It all make sense. Bibi well balanced.(tick is lobber) anyways, I think    supercell hates Korea(or my tablet.becauseI broke my tablet while playing brawl stars...........)na.          anyways, there is a few reasons why.                                      
---
#1: there's no Nita skin Korea ver. there is Shiba Nita,panda Nita,but no else. Ya know,Shiba dogs are from Japan, and pandas are from China. but Korea. there is nothing.no tiger or something.bears are not(or yes but there pretty far likely.) having Korea's Image. so It is.
---
2#:there is a forgotten rumor that  a guy (he is Korean.) once was banned for no reason. supercell said it is because  he lended his account to another guy. now so,If you ask them, they don't reply.that is weird.
---
3#this is akward actually,but in clash a Rama, there is a episode where the Finland beats Korea.      N  Do they didn't just think Korea is good but they hate them so they beat Korea with tricks?           
---
Finally, we get this: supercell hates Korea,so they don't have Korea Nita (to hide blame, limited edition Colt skin can not buy now),And so ya know,a little rubissh, but why does leon not have skin or voice:because..................er....................leon is Korean.okay,why? because supercell hates Korea. they made an o.p into shit to prank them,and they can't pronounce Korean and hate them,they don't give leon voice. 
---
+So where  does that go? Of course to Brock and other new brawlers,and they give nothing to leon 
---
Because they hate Koreans and leon because they're like leon is Asian or so.or Korean
---
Poco looks badass!!! Damn I ain‚Äôt never seen him like that before
---
Thumbnail.exe
---
Because Supercell would lose money lel
---
We just need ICON to avoid clutter as much as we can
---
If u can't remember the icon, chances are, you probably can't remember the name so I think we only need the ICON of the sp
---
It sucked
---
Lol yeah
---
Band-aid Shelly = Down vote
---
Just kidding dude, that‚Äôs awesome
---
Imagine how much more powerfull his jump will be weighing 500 pounds, it would be worse than dynamikes super
---
Hah man that got me
---
Star points... is... pink.... tho
---
I bought this skin for 19 gems so not
---
doesn't count as an actual rarity since you need trophies to unlock them
---
So... super rare + mythic 
---
Two brawler! AMAZING ;)
---
This was me
---
Original Rosa was the most OP ever in the game that's why she is a bully
---
12.6k with 0 legendaries
---
Anyone else think Spike looks funny from behind?
---
Lol
---
Who are you?
---
Well, there is a brawl stars rule 34 sub, and now i think they'll get combinations of rule 34 and 63
---
For those wondering what sub i mean r/brawlstarsp (look at your own risk)
---
Yes,yes he is.
---
I meant that OP's idea would be useless because that screen is skipped a lot of the time for some people, I didn't say "Supercell fix this."
---
I didnt even know u guys had ur supers all at once, i just gave up because i knew were were not gonna winüòî
---
Cursed video
---
Cause you can actually see upwards
---
Were you playing with other people or was the 3 legendaries a coincidence?

No, i was playing with my friends. Was the triple jump a coincidence?

I reported him
---
It isn‚Äôt bad. I fact it‚Äôs bettter than first. Can u think before u post. It isn‚Äôt funny. Crow is my favourite brawler and I would say that it‚Äôs starpowers are equally good if ur a pro and u can notice how strong it could be.
---
Spread out spawns shelly can just run your way then you wouldn't notice first then too late also WAY TO MUCH CACTUS
---
Mortis, Crow, and Frank
---
How would you know?
---
she T H I C C
---
Nope, it does nothing.
---
BRUH FLEXES SHIBA NITA
---
I will change the spawns but I‚Äôm keeping all the cactus
---
You're not very good at giving advice.
---
Halloween brawler...? Both mortis and frank are purple-ish and they both woulf fit a "scary" theme.
---
So it's just for show? Does it show on your profile how many awards you have won?
---
the blending colors are insane. best art ive seen in a while
---
No I was with my friends too. I was playing piper and I said the win is only a win if I‚Äôm in the air at the end. Then we had the idea of having all of us in the air at the end, and there were three brawlers that we have that can jump.
---
Hmm
---
This happened to me once. There was this bo in brawl ball who was in my team and when i passed the ball to him he just spinned and scored our own goal 2 times. This is a BIG issue in brawl ball and i hope supercell fixes it.
---
There is no other way that is possible as a Free2play
---
Yea, it should be :

Did you really downvote me for explaining lol...  
---
It‚Äôs a game man, some people just play for fun, not to be super try hard. But honestly I do both, there‚Äôs times where I‚Äôll do this. And times where I just take every opportunity I get, mostly a spur of the moment thing or mood thing. Or your attitude towards that opponent, did they steal your box and harass you, kill em. Where they a respectable opponent that benefitted you during the match, maybe give them a fighting chance.
---
holy--- i remember it took me FORVER to beat this game cause i suck as console games. I loved it though.
---
I have all the brawlers. Opened boxes for star powers.
---
What? Do you want this clip in a video? Or...

Lol ok :)

Those are duo spawns
