People abuse it in every game that has this function but that doesn't mean that the function should not exist it simply means that you need a good algorithm that punishes the abuser and punishes the report

And going beyond a support with people in case there is an error would be indispensable

Fair enough. There‚Äôs no need to keep a watermark on a template unless it uses someone‚Äôs artwork though, no one will mind.

That's not the right account

Oh ok

It will be 7 11 19 25 35 if these doesnt happen it means that someone from the future knows that i am giving the winning numbers and decides to change it

Literally the most obvious skin idea ever I hope supercell adds it

I meant the idea of rhyming it. I guess it's not because of that brawler combo meme.
---
Uhuuuuuuum
---
Either is fine for getting brawlers. What you want is the most number of random draws, and 15 random draws is more than 10.
---
Anyways it's just a format so he didn't steal it oh well
---
\*ahem ahem\* I am quite opposed to your opinion. This might be easy for someone to say who HAS a legendary, but as a long-time dedicated player who has spent well over $100 on this game, played for months, and ranked on the leader boards for several brawlers, but still haven't received a SINGLE legendary on any of my accounts, I am going to disagree with you, completely. Legendaries may not be the best brawlers, but they are the rarest, and they offer unique abilities and playing experiences which you can't find anywhere else in the game, for instance invisibility: something that only two brawlers, both in the legendary tier, can use (sandy's super gives it to his team, but still much better to use it yourself). Also, when everyone around me who has lower trophies and is f2p, and noobs who hardly ever play the game get a legendary, I hate them for it. But I hate myself the most because my stupid luck can't even offer me a single legendary brawler. I hope you find my opinion useful to your little discussion because as I understand it, you are strongly opposed to players like me.

Honestly I don't know because we upgraded it.. but it always sucks at night

but the ability to go invisible is very good and unique and i think 7 seconds is enough. and both star powers of leon are viable so i think sandy is the one who is too overpowered but leon is not that bad if you know how to use him

Np, thanks for the question, glad we cleared things up

Wow I always thought it was just me that saw the bulletd bigger. But not only they are visually bigger, also I have the feeling (idk if its just an illusion) that their hitbox is also bigger, making it easier to hit players. If it is actually this way, its completely an error and should be removed. Skins shouldnt change gameplay...

I mean what else are they supposed to do? Leave it being broken like 7 secs -80% rosa shield?

Not even true you just suck even with the trophy  buff
---
So happy to see Tick nerfed, he's the most annoying brawler in the game.
---
Why was Jessie buffed?
---
Why Crow buff?
---
I'm sorry Leon doesn't get a buff
---
Here come dat boi
---
I want to give you an award so badly lmao
---
the best balance change in this year crow tara and jessie deserved this buff and now everyone will use ambush instead of snapy sniping piper can now do 3k damage if she is in the bush yikes
---
It really is
---
#buffpoco
---
*J e s s i c a*

Yeah Leon deserves a buff he was forgotten by supercell
---
OP Creepy Harvest is back!
---
Are you 8 or what? Because you clearly don't understand the season reset
---
It will still be strong, it‚Äôs not about the damage, it‚Äôs about the inability heal and being revealed by the sandstorm
---
Wdym
---
This sucks
---
Mortoise on tortoise,now its rhyming !
---
Tick could destroy the crates with trhowing his super into the Hole
---
That's fair, but they must have known his super was busted.
---
This. I feel like I‚Äôm about to get wooooshed, there‚Äôs no way this guy is this stupid
---
they nerfed sandy's star power too much making it 100 would have been enough

Real sad doe

shelly needs a rework she has a useless attack and a broken super

Crow Buff? ~~OH YES!!!~~

Stop this already its shit now
---
Kaw caw! ü§üüêª
---
How bout on the supercell shop dude
---
HOW DO YOU NOT KNOW THAT
---
Basically, they reverted Batting Stance
---
This is the second time they have changed Bibi
---
It‚Äôs not like all the brawlers don‚Äôt have her
---
This meme sucks 
---
The rhyme meme died out in less than a day
---
Its never to early for Halloween
---
Lucky
---
Also since crow is getting multiple buffs
---
Write the name of the content creator you want ti support in the blank space. :)

Finally Tick rng removed and explosion nerf! I'm really Happy rn
---
Not funny. Didnt laughed
---
Wait, didn't Bibi's Battering Stance already get a nerf to 30% on previously? Why is it still being mentioned in this new patch? Will it be another nerf aside from the HP?
---
Leon gang :)
---
she can 3 shot tanks (even primo) now. this is absurd amount of buff. don't touch bounty till next balance update.
---
Battle Stance was actually the chosen Star Power by pros after Home Run was nerfed. And it was really strong as well. The nerf was justified so that both star powers are fairly equal
---
Mortis would be balanced finally
---
kairos said that  his range/duration reduction might require client update.
---
exactly :)
---
it includes revealing location of brawlers even if they are in grass or inside another sandy super.
---
Tick nerf. YEEEEAAAAHHHHH BOYYYY!
---
Just realised even frank with sponge cant take a 4th hit
---
for everyone
---
Yeah I know that but throw your super 2 times at the same spot from a same distance, both doesn't look the same, so its not a fixed pattern right? (And yes i know there will be 2 on top 1 middle and 2 on bottom, thats fixed. I am not talking about that)

I would save but if you don‚Äôt want to save get hyper

When you have no one
---
Because he is very bad without his star power Coiled Snake
---
Woowoo
---
OK, thanks (nothing interesting for F2P)
---
I think crow's poison need to be nerf for 2 seconds
---
Now I would like to play Tara
---
‚ÄúStar player‚Äù is completely useless since the introduction of tick
---
Or supercell can add a like/dislike button. When you like the like amount of that person increase and vice versa. If that person have low like amount then there is less chance you will be matched with him. Disliked players will automatically be in your blacklist (u won't see them again) and the liked one will pop up more frequently.
---
Wow, no one knows about it
---
Happened to me, but it was Rush Wars
---
Hyper, but it‚Äôs really only useful in heist. Actually that‚Äôs the only game mode where she‚Äôs really good. They need to buff her
---
Damn she looks really pissed off
---
But still it requires high skill to use Piper..... 
---
She is good on open maps but when at close range she really suffers 
---
She may have high dmg in long range but at close range she can be taken out by every single brawler in the game
---
Lmao I have 47k I have bought all the star points skins except the golden one
---
nice
---
What?
---
At first I thought it was hard to do but then

Epic nazo :D

You‚Äôre in a good spot though. You should be getting only gold from boxes, no?

Holy shit i can one shot literally any brawler with new piper buff

Ohhhh that explains my life

I actually knew ._.

Haha this boy is a JOKE. You must be some kid that doesn‚Äôt comprehend anything

Bear with me

God why do guys always think that Bibi is too strong why just because you always got killed by Bibis in showdown?
---
"Nobody cares", more like bore ragnarok
---
Oh cool
---
Bless the tick nerf
---
I mean it's not like the character is good anyways lmao
---
Dude u have a legendary, I got a legendary after playing for 1 year. Be quiet and humble yourself
---
yeah, light mecha and gold mecha cost 10k and 50k respectively so it‚Äôs already 120000
---
You shouldn't be complaining about drop rates at those trophies... If they buffed them too much they would be godly and there would be no point to buying anything else
---
Isn't that the way they wanted him?
---
Agreed, but the same can kinda be said for every other brawler in the game for any other mode, can't it? Tara's win rates on bounty, despite the low use rates, are quite high, and it's been shown that piper can be good on brawl ball. Heck, why not play poco on heist when he's good at supporting tanks like bull and primo?
---
I was the original poem leave post maker..
---
This doesn't rhyme
---
The only reason I ask is because I recently came back from a 10 month break so I'm not sure if it's good value or not, I think it is but I'd like to hear your opinion
---
Literally me! I just can‚Äôt help it...
---
Show mano‚ù§üëå

Of course, it was just insane prior to this nerf and they must have known

I would.. time to get downvoted for having the minority opinion

Except the fact that's not written Los Del Rio, but his Reddit name...

why do i not have upvotesüòÇ
---
That's what I was thinking too at least buff band-aid, but don't buff it to the point where its super game breaking. 
---
2,500 and 3,000 would feel ok in band-aid, but not too OP so good idea on the amounts of HP idea
---
??
---
Broken beyond repair.

Darryl is fine, your buff would make him absolutely broken, just like he was in the assassin meta months ago.

Ummmm... Ok?

Reworks and reposts aren‚Äôt the same thing. I took the time to redraw and rework Topper because I was unsatisfied with the original. If this post was a repost everything would have remained the same.
---
Still surviving that long has got to be impossible without mods.
---
Jessie  needed a buff. Maybe not a damage on tho. I think she needed a faster projectile to be harder to the enemy dodge it.
---
Crow I think he was balanced however he was not competitive brawler. So they are probably trying to make him apear more in competitive scene. Since he is the second most loved brawler in the game
---
Gameplay?
---
Haha
---
I don‚Äôt play Mortis nor do I record my games, I just play and observe
---
Leon want me XD
---
ok

HAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAGAHAHAHHAHAAHAHAHGAGAHAHAHHA
---
I actually like these changes, great job!
---
ok but why did you downvote?
---
Crow op
---
I'LL FUCKING SUPER YOUR FACE OFF TOO.
---
I think it's a great idea for a star points skin! It should cost around 2500 star points and I can finally buy a skin for her
---
Aren't you frogetting something? Shouldn't it be 125 Gems?
---
Dude, its not even an actual game
---
how much trophies
---
10.570k
---
She's a dumpster tier brawler with the chainable super being her only strength. The game shouldn't be balanced around 200 trophy players.
---
see you in hot
---
Honestly tho I agree. The Morris buff is solid and good, he was struggling to survive against a lot of brawlers. The piper buff, well that‚Äôs just too op. She can literally two shot Pam from a bush. That‚Äôs not good, most other brawlers are one shot now. Tara had a good buff. She just didn‚Äôt do the damage up close. So overall these are good changes (not including the piper buff).
---
Guys I will help you with the first 2 images on left. The first image is from "The Lion King" and the second image is the betrayal meme from modern warfare. Hope u guys understandüòÖ
---
HOODIE HOMIES ! THIS MEANS WAR!

I agree its still dumb that a card does more damage than a fricking knife/dagger
---
Yup, you're paying less than 100 gems for basically 20 boxes.
---
Can't find it mate..
---
Brock is OP!
---
Nice
---
Have 104 and 10 big boxes planing to do a vid with 250 brawl and 20 big
---
Because it was too OP: you could destroy the mega robot of 3 power up very fast and do a lot of damage at Raid
---
I never said I liked any of his nerfs. I simply implied that he is still a pretty good brawler. Then you continue with more incoherent bias claims by saying that everyone with a brain says Darryl is in a bad spot. In fact, I don‚Äôt agree and I indeed have a brain. You shouldn‚Äôt look for brawltubers with the stats to judge brawlers because most of the player base is pretty garbage (low trophies). You need to elaborate on why the brawler is bad or good with mechanics and comparisons. And ‚Äúgetting riled up‚Äù does not describe your response to that other guy. You verbally offended him. That decreases your credibility and it draws petitions away from you.

 Did you get this from Youtube comments on Kairos's new vid?
---
Ahh yes of course
---
Me boi a loney whyy
---
If you calculate how much damage deals his poison/fire/electricity it's the same as his dagger so a card scratch is the same as 4 seconds of poison/fire/electricity, lmao, but tara is still a bad character, she deserved a buff
---
It's not the matchmaking's fault, it's because the other guy was playing with him
---
Darryl has more range than Bull.. so he can 1x1 him. You can chip him away and when he is at mid Hp roll on him and insta kill him.
---
Rosa and primo you can roll on them.. also you have a faster shoot animation than both. Also more damage. You only have to be carefull about their supers.. and always roll with full ammo.
---
He only have less HP than them but with his 1st SP he has the shield.
---
His super is a lot better than Bull's for engaging
---
Rosa has no engage tool..
---
For me the only heavywheight better than him right now is El Primo but even them you can deal with
---

smh Crow's main attack getting overbuffed when it was already good for support
---
Because he was VERY low risk, medium reward. He can stay behind walls and on the opposite side of the map and hit multiple enemies for free. Against most comps, there wasn't a lot of counterplay involved, even though Tick would not necessarily be bursting everyone immediately.

Brock: n-nowhere!

It could be like that but but this is absolutely same like the other

Yes, if their gonna add something this Halloween, theY NEED to add this. Hopefully we'll not able to toggle it and not just *only being active for the duration of the event.*

I killed Mortis in showdown duo multiple times I was playing Dynamike he was the power cubes (role reverse)
---
would you agree with me that i shouldn't be opening boxes anymore until a new brawler comes out?
---
I feel like the star power change for piper was only to balance it with snappy sniping. They could balance snappy sniping by giving piper delay between autoaiming shots--.75-1 second delay would entirely fix it so you cannot just spam it. It would then take skill to aim and benefit from the reload buff.  
---
For sandy, he is still going to be extremely strong with the amount of stage control he offers with his super radius. I feel his super should have a diameter of about 7-8 tiles for it to control only 1 lane and not multiple.   
---
For the other changes, these are actually very good changes. Very well done.

Dont nerf invisible brawlers, then what is the point of "invisible" if other players can see them while healing shade heals them

They Bush camp

Why?

It gives them trophies by doing they are mostly non-skilled players who can't play with other brawlers except bull,shelly,primo.Or they just want to get some free trophies
---
An I one of the few who think Piper didn't need a buff at all? Same with Jessie. Scrappy needed a buff, but not Jessie.

They had us in the first place, not gonna lie.

You know frank is bad when he can be taken out by the most trash brawler in the game
---
I really like this set of changes.
---
Tara felt really weak before I pulled Healing Shade and both her poor base stats and original star power got a needed buff.
---
I have a friend who really likes Jessie, and I wanted to like Jessie but the overall poor damage output in most modes made that hard.
---
Crow‚Äôs one of my favorite brawlers. Any buff is good in my eyes.
---
Ambush was always the Star Power I found more fun to use, so with that big of a buff Piper will be a lot of fun until you inevitably nerf it. Thank you. I wish Snappy Sniping got a little buff too, like 0.3 to 0.33, but it only takes one SP I like to be happy with the state of a brawler.
---
More reason to use Creepy Harvest is appreciated.
---
Same for Magic Puffs.
---
Batting Stance was definitely too strong. I think the health nerf on top was too much and a whole quarter cut was probably excessive, but as Bibi‚Äôs not one of my favorites I‚Äôm not too upset to see what might be a slight overnerf.
---
Not a fan of the Primo nerf, but I definitely understand. Would have been cool if El Fuego was made useful too, though.
---
So all in all, my only complaints are that Sandy wasn‚Äôt nerfed a little harder (such as hitpoints reduced by 10% - there‚Äôs no reason he should be somewhat tanky with his kit) and that El Fuego didn‚Äôt get a rework or buff. I would have liked to see it changed to leaving a fire effect like Incendiary and Balls of Fire in, say, a 2.5 or 3.0 tile radius that did 750 DPS for 4 seconds so it would have a use for destroying stationary objects and some area denial but not be that useful for killing anyone - obviously if it did that much damage as a lingering effect landing on anyone would be a guaranteed 4140 damage, enough to kill many of the brawlers without further attacks. However, guaranteed destruction of any turrets Primo landed on and taking out nearly 7.5% extra health on safes per landed super as pretty much the entirety of his star power doesn‚Äôt seem so broken when his other one is a very significant movement speed boost that‚Äôs useful every single time you use Primo‚Äôs super.

Pam is the best tank to kill Shelly with, period. After that is probably Rosa with her ability to reduce damage and deal good damage outside of Shelly‚Äôs dangerous range.

No, of course not. Mega boxes will never be worth it. That is an effective 11 gem discount. You could buy 2 50 gem 1000 token doublers for 100 gems which has the same value as that offer. This offer has a value of 22.47 tokens per gem.   
---
Or you could buy 2 39 gem 1400 token doubler offers for a total of 78 gems and get 28 boxes. 8 more boxes for 11 less gems. This offer has a value of 35.89 tokens per gem.   
---
Better yet you could buy 65 tickets for 49 gems. At 32 tokens per ticket(very easy with 8-bit in the game) you get 2080 tokens or almost 21 boxes for 49 gems. This offer has a value of 42.44 tokens per gem. About double the value of the offer in your question.

Piper on heist....
---
It‚Äôs basically the same as one of Rico‚Äôs projectiles
---
It makes sense until you get a brawler you‚Äôve been waiting to get for an entire year so you just want to play with them. And then it feels like the game is punishing you for being good... I don‚Äôt want to purposely lose, I don‚Äôt want to spend a ton of money to buy gems, and I want to play him... just a rough spot hahaha
---
There isn‚Äôt one

Doesn‚Äôt really matter I think couz piper got a skin with remodel to ‚Ä¶

Awesome!

Wow !!! 55 minutes before it was at 100 upvotes now it‚Äôs at 200 congrats again lol

They took out his RNG which makes attacking with him more consistent. I could hardly win a game with him before and won my first 5 games with him today

Definitely has a lot of influence. Mortises attack is very unique so adding another brawler with a dash attack seems reasonable. The pouncing feature has some of the crow mechanics but bouncing back creates a whole new layer that is unlike any super in the game. I also feel like being able to would an opponent (similar to poison and burn) adds a new animation to the game.
---
Imo no. The difference is this meta is starpowers, so usually in Low trophies it‚Äôs fine. But Rosa was the brawler, and she was ridiculously easy to get and OP, meaning it affected all trophy ranges
---
My data is good tho and the WiFi logo happens whether you use data or WiFi
