Ummmm.....isn't the bottom right word a racial slur.  Like using the n-word with hard er?

But manually aiming will lead to massive delay

How? You cant even get 158 as rico

Dude it‚Äôs also partially luck.  You don‚Äôt get away with 96 hp and call it skill.

Good and honest lovin' is overrated. Play the field/map while you still can. Get into every lane and shoot your rockets indiscriminately. You can settle down when you get arthritis in your thumbs.

Guys, I'm shaking. I'm fucking shaking. I never wanted to breed with anyone more than I want to with. That perfect, muscular body. Those bulging biceps. The child making reproductive organ of a literal god. It honestly fucking hurts knowing that I'll never mate with him, make him pass his genes through me, and have him care for our perfect offspring. I'd do fucking ANYTHING for the chance to reproduce with . A N Y T H I N G. And the fact that I can't is quite honestly too much to fucking bear. Why would  create something so perfect? To fucking tantalize us? Fucking laugh in our faces?! Honestly guys, I just can't anymore.Fuck

I expressed myself badly, it's good to buy power points, but it's good to focus on just 3 brawlers at most, I'd say.

Oh that. Interesting

dont start with this again. mortis is very strong and has been even moreso since coiled snake. stop playing him in his bad modes and charging shellies with supers and go slaughter throwers, turrets, and snipers in bounty or smth
---
Nobody:
---
That one person at school: Taperon.
---
Sandy: I'm feeling sleepy
---
I can see why he's disappointed
---
oh thats pretty good
---
By the way, I am pretty sure Piper does more damage from far away because of change in SOT (speed over time). In physics, an object soaring through the wind would gain more speed over time. That's why in Boss Fight when you are far away the missiles are supersonic (the rockets come from the Boss in case you didn't know but you most likely do).
---
(No hate the models look clean)This looks like the 3D stuff that little kids would watch. Anyway make them dance, Mortis would look hella funny dancing.

But this means that most of the kids on this subreddit won't have anything else to post. They're so bored and they have to make recycled memes and beg for karma. In my opinion, memes doesn't progress a game and make it better, but rather make it worse.

good it will get rid of them

Unless it has actual effort memes are bad

The worse memes are the recycled ones, and they get 3k upvotes for just putting brawler icons on top of pictures. If it's an original meme template, or the "Brawl stars version" of a meme template, then that's fine; but I'm pretty sick of seeing the same memes over and over again. Especially the "Every Single time" memes.
---
yea i saw a post on here where a guy had a bunch of power cubes and at the final moments of it, he wiped out the bot and got first so i was trying to recreate it, been going at it for fucking hours and of course when i'm actually getting kinda close to it, that happened. Im not necessarily blaming supercell, that part im just messing around, but it wasnt my wifi cuz everything else was working fine
---
How did I miss the cross "X" on the TOP tick.... smh
---
Thank you, u/Bird-Rapist, very cool
---
*BenTimm1 has entered the chat*

"How? And why?"
---
They fixed Band-Aid after all the star powers were released. Snappy Sniping aswell. And they can‚Äôt really test the brawlers too well, so they come out broken or underpowered. Balance changes are always needed.
---
Please, TAKE A BREAK.

Guys Im uncontrollably shifting.

Ur post bruh u lost

If u Keep trashtalking about brawl stars  can u quit the game we don‚Äôt need you
---
No people collect invites like I also have max pending invites
---
I‚Äôm sorry, I have to disagree with the Tara rank. Have you ever seen those videos where people throw regular playing cars through watermelons? And she has magic cards too
---
That's not "8bits", that's called Pixel Art, and you should try learning the basics of Pixel Art.
---
Hmm
---
Just hit 12k for nothing
---
I see you've experienced island invasion

7000 boxes

1 Big box
---
WAIT, thats illegal

You can quit the game if you trashtalk brawl stars we don‚Äôt need u

i mean they should know how canceorus it is

By "recreating it" you mean you just put a filter on it?

I didnt say it is impossible, I only said it isn't fair

---
Beautiful
---
It's perfectly balanced as all things should be
---
Hey... Thanks a lot dude!!!
---
I have to disagree with the poco one. If his SOUND is enough to PHYSICALLY HURT a brawler, that means that if your hit by poco‚Äôs music, it‚Äôs most likely to be more than being deaf
---
congrats i maxed poco yesterday and he is also my first maxed brawler
---
10/10 and upvoted
---
Nah just to play with friends
---
The star power rate is always 1,00%. It increased because you completed sone other categories. What changed since the update is that now they show this increment in the rates and they show 0% in the categories you completed
---
Bro the trophy is so Low and I sell for 100 no one will ever buy
---
If I get 70 more trophies I‚Äôll be top 200 in the world, but that‚Äôs a long long journey. I just got mikes Star power so I‚Äôm still learning how to use it but once I do hopefully I can get to 750 without abusing showdown
---
thanks :)
---
Why are you talking about those things with kids around?
---
What is your problem? If you want I'll just leave reddit, Mr Random guy I've never met who is probably 1k trophies
---
It's just a meme, not complaining
---
ok. You can‚Äôt just post that and not expect someone to shake to that

yeah next i will make snake prairie for lone star

also, doesn't sandy throw "sharp pebbles"? they said he throws sand in the brawl talk but his attack description ingame says it's pebbles 
---
*i mean i can't see a bunch of pebbles doing a lot of damage but imagine if they got in your eyes*
---
No i mean I  will get if it is $5 cause I have like twice your trophies
---
Wish I could flex like that. Only flexes I got are luck based such as pulled crow, 8 days later got spike then next box star power, 3 days later got spike on mini. But no bragging rights skill related.

You should have added how bull naruto running somehow hurts a lot
---
Only people who don't know how to play mortis correctly think he needs a buff
---
Even better than others
---
*snap*
---
Lmao I played against Yamada youtube with my level 2 sandy with 200 trophies  and he was using level 10 sandy at 900 trophies but I won him in gem grab
---
Try trolling better, literally said "I'm not asking for legendaries"

yeah the whole idea of the mode is to damage the robot

Lol I have so much star points even after buying all the mega box and both mecha skins
---
Noice
---
Give this skin to me its too cool
---
Lol I have all the skins except the gold ones
---
Well if your legendary rate is at 0.1, then you'll take an average of a thousand boxes to get it. And that's just an average. 11 mega boxes is roughly a tenth of that.
---
Lol so true
---
And shouldn't 8-bit burn 6 holes in you with his lazers
---
One time I was playing Brock against colt in showdown. After 30 seconds of missing all of our shots we just spun at each other and went our separate ways
---
I‚Äôm Leon and I have f2p
---
Noe i opened 2 big boxes and i dindt get anything
---
Great design ! Love it !
---
The one thing that slightly bugs me though is that there are 7 brawlers in it when it is clearly a game of gem grab.
---
Hmmmm good point but at least the 4 first slots lol
---
End his suffering
---
Look niceeeüëå
---
YOURE NOT FUCKING SUPPOSED TO DUMBASS, TWO BIG BOXES? ARE YOU FUCKING SEVEN YEARS OLD?
---
Now. Wait for the next 20 brawlers to release and ultimate box opening ;)

This isn't going to have any impact on game performance. Every game client already knows their position from 1-10 in the server, but groups them into bins for the respective messages that you currently see. All this will do is show the exact positioning. The performance impact you get will be so little there won't even be a difference. And I don't think there are 100000 live players on a single server at the same time.

ahh the memories from beta

Not at all if you think a post saying that I'm at 10k and don't have any legendary but with a meme format gets 4k upvotes.

Or forgive beach brock...

no

Shelly's hurting each other, you finish them of or powercube stealing and being inevitable
---
I mean maybe Piper's bullets pick up speed the longer they are in the air and thats why they do more damage the further they travel?
---
Enjoy level 9 Legendaries on ladder.

I know that now. Had to watch a couple YouTube videos first to find out though.

But it‚Äôs not just lonestar, I just used it as an example.

Not for bentimm he got it from a single brawl box on his first try

That's a stupidly huge buff but I know what he feels like but there is a counter to Shelly... Run into the poison you can end your suffering quickly and the Shelly won't get the power cubes! I'm not siding with him but a Shelly chasing a mortis is really annoying...

There was a trophy change, an inflation, where getting trophies is way easier now. Getting brawlers to 500+ isn't that hard, but with the addition of this, there have been more ranks above Rank 20. Still, getting trophies have been easier than it was a few months ago.

They didn't change the chances. They just made it more clear in the infographic by not factoring in chances for brawlers you couldn't get because you already had all those. That 97% or whatever it use to be chance to get coins + power points was basically just 100% minus chance at star power minus chance at all brawlers. Now it doesn't show the chance at brawlers, it probably only includes a legendary chance.

I'll take your entire collection of quick animations

If a player crashes or stars the match at the wrong time it's not thier fault. This is why the player turns into a bot when you close the game. It is very common so a lot of people would lose more trophies for no reason, they did nothing wrong.

I guess you didnt spent a dime. No hate bro but if nobody would pay, you couldnt play this game. Think abou it.

Exactly, that is why it is still the usual -8 trophies and not minus more trophies. Also, my idea is that this only affects players who has met the 3 criteria stated above. That means, if you crash, and come back within 30 seconds, it doesn't affect you.

When big game first came out, it was really easy to match up with your friends with you all qued up with 500 trophy brawlers (bc it was super difficult to get back then). Once you all got into the game together, you‚Äôd just let the boss get max time‚Äîthis was also before decay was added so it was easy

I completely agree with this. Skill cap is what makes this game fun.

I shouldn't have to quit over balance changes, but that's what happened.

is that lwarb private server? i play it and i know that skin. they removed it sadly even the unholy leon

Not really New

I should put this I'm my fusions

On the pc
---
BUFF MORTIS!
---
No, that's way too much...
---
Nice but it doesn't work as indestructible blocks don't exist anymore
---
Leon‚Äôs star powers actually work Inside of sandys super. (His star powers say during his super) So take advantage of it until they patch it.
---
Yeah, maybe they could set up a conversion/exchange system, where they could pay (lets say) 2 coins for 1 star point. Idk
---
In my opinion the Mortis' one is too OP. And maybe also Leon's one. However good Ideas
---
Oh! Then that space can be left empty.
---
Wow! Truly amazing! I didn't know this beautiful voice line was in the game!
---
also the "get 0 if you win" should also apply to losing, kinda like in tf2
---
Really cool idea but I think the first star power is op
---
I know it‚Äôs not yours, but everyone has already seen this and there is no need to post it again. It looks like a really cheap way to get karma.

the design is very original, but that there are so many bushes and the unions between islands are so small it will make a map with many campers

I have a theory: what if the reason game gives lower tier players better brawlers is just to get them invested in the game more? Just think about it, why would they give you Sandy when you play it consistently for &gt;1/2 a day. They have no reason because the algorithm knows you won't stop playing anytime soon. And when you stop playing that oftenly they give you legendary to hook you again. Once I didn't play for almost a month and I got Tara from the second blue box I opened. It might have been just a coincidence. Who knows but I kinda believe this theory.

She is able to pull enemies in a radius together, the super in itself doesn‚Äôt do much damage, but since Tara has splash damage when you pull at least two brawlers you are able to do a TON of damage.

I only noticed the fuqin butt plug because a friend's finger swiped across my screen. And no, I wouldn't spin the rarest brawlers around, I'd jump in to a battle within seconds of obtaining them to play the game. I already know what the brawlers look like because you can see the details in battle. Now shut up and play the game instead of trying to defend the fact you get no real ass and only play the game to stare at fantasy ass.

I agree that his is midrange though he excels in close range so let's say in solo showdown Crow which takes about 5 or 6 attacks (depending) on his level to break while Leon could just get near and neither take it for himself or kill the defenseless crow that has no ammo

By ‚Äúyou kind of can‚Äù, I mean you can disable one star power by picking the other.

You can‚Äôt choose to make Dynamike power 9, but you can turn off Dynajump as long as you have Demolition.

The best part is out of the 6 games we played we lost 1 and I got star Player for 4/5 we won
---
Yes i want this to be in game!!
---
You tryin to make it more harder to get boxes?
---
No. And you only buy skins for characters you have. So if you dont have gene you cant buy his skin
---
Really good job and I really like the concept, but like communism when you put it into practice it doesn‚Äôt work too well. Poison is coming in? Well it‚Äôs either dying on the ring or immediately being Supered by a shell camping the landing zone. All throwers, ninjas, ranged or any brawler that doesn‚Äôt have a shotgun would instantly die . Also the islands would have to be incredibly small to accommodate the massive amount of water between them. A sandy, spike, 8bit, Pam, barley, dynamike super would cover most of not all of the island. Looks really great but launchpads or paths to get to the center instead of an open map with walls and bushes for cover just doesn‚Äôt work in this game.
---
Crow is actually my favorite legendary although I don't have him which sucks but here's the thing crow is meant to be a pain in the ass and not a high damage dealing brawler all his aspects regarding his speed poison fast reload speed and his super which is made for him to escape or ambush he isn't meant to be an aggressive brawler although a little health buff wont be bad.
---
what about crow?
---
He's talking about some other console better than brawl stars, go install brawl stars on it and u get shit wifi and plus you get extra games that are official by the nintendo company.

Love it. The idea of his coconut head chasing brawlers around whenever he uses his super. Also the crab on his leaf cape is a super nice touch üòä
---
Legendary food for dynamike
---
yes, but when you are playing at high trophies there is a decently high chance that you can get queued with the same players, and because of this they can try to get into the same game as their friends by solo queuing, and if the game isnt going well one person can just leave and cut the losses for their other teammate to boost his trophies. Whenever there is trophy compensation in a competitive game people will always find a way to abuse it. Your idea could work if there was a set cap at around 500.

Or they could just be like power cube crates where they have HP. That way anyone can blow them up. That would make it more interesting. Here are some situations you could encounter:
---
* If someone is bush camping next to a bunch, you could shoot the crates to get them out of the bush instead of shooting the bush. 
---
* You could lower the crates' HP and then leave them so you could shoot them if someone gets too close to the crates.
---
* The crates could be in positions where they will blow up walls to either let you get at other brawlers or escape.

Ricochet...come back...come back....

They are wrong, and many people seem to not understand how the odds in BS work. I saw it myself that a rare brawler dragged my luck down, but by a very little amount. IIRC it once even didnt show it dropping (meaning I was close to having it go up)

This is sick
