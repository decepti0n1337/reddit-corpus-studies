Nothing is wrong with teaming. Are you saying that since I was stuck in a bad area and got bullied out of a power cube I should just lose? Nah I'm charismatic not stupid. What if youre in the last 3, you have 3 cubes, and the others have 4 and 16? You just accept 3rd or 2nd place? Nothing's more annoying than trying to chip at the guy with 13 cubes in a 1v1v1 as the other dumbass solidifies his spot at 2nd. Sorry man but teaming isnt evil its a power in our hands to smite those more fortunate (with power cubes) than us

Because you didnt buy it before so they are allowing you to buy it now kind of like in clash royale when you get arena 4 offers in arena 10

Ohhhhh

Alright. Have fun talking to yourself then.

Good concept I've never seen anything like this, this would definitely add more skill and team work into the game. Well done!

Imagine a Rosa Bull Shelly Primo Darryl combo

I like this idea. There could be combined supers for brawlers who has (probaly) relations  with each other (e.g: Mortis and Frank)

Self esteem went down, played cause he makes me happy when I play him. Then this.
---
Not asking for sympathy just a little PSA
---
We could maybe have 2 star power for every character or more and We Can choose only one to play with , and some could have more advantage in like gem grab than showdown So we choose the best one depending the mod We are going to play .

Yeah I know

His name or what?

y'all remember the frank buff?

Wow Rico is a gumball machine WhAt A TwIsT...

😀hope supercell can make more star power

nice
---
Does this work for unexpected tf2?
---
And how exactly do you avoid genes shots and get close to him? Or avoid crows daggers? Sure you can do some fancy dodging and use cacti and walls to block shots, but this makes short range characters nearly unplayable.

Would be interesting. Take my upvote

I unlocked my first epic brawler at 5K trophies
---
Why do people lose trophies on purpose?
---
Booooooo
---
Her Super -_-
---
For real. I have tried for so long to get my Leon to 400 trophies. I would do great and get far until I lose every single battle and have to restart at 290-300. It sucks. I just want to replay my fails...
---
Wait... That's illegal
---
It's back bro.
---
At 3400... supercell plz
---
The old models.... I miss you Mortis, ricochet, brock, and dynamike.
---
Bruh
---
haha thats so true
---
See what it’s like I. 400-500 cause it’s obvious non of your brawlers are there. It’s fucking hell.
---
Enter in my profile, there is a video where my crow kills a piper in the air with the poison
---
I guess you are right but the core of my point still stands. Everything would be very restricted
---
Optimist view: they want easier matches so they lose trophies. They don’t care about trophy pushing so there’s no negative to losing them
---
Pessimist view: they enjoy knowing that others are getting frustrated.
---
You have to know who to mess with and who not to mess with. I’ve seen close range brawlers that don’t camp and still they do pretty well. Maybe with this change they can give a buff to the close range brawlers as well. And you don’t necessarily have to make the duration 17 seconds as well. You can make it 25 seconds so it will also be in favour of close range brawlers.
---
Well we cant turn them into James Charles
---
Kinda like fusion?

Those are scary...

Oh I thought everyone trophy pushed for rewards. Wondered why I kept seeing videos of people scoring on themselves in brawl ball. Thanks!
---
dont like it? dont click on it.
---
I lol'ed

i also am against teaming, but it’s not like it’s against the rules, as the only rule is to survive, so it’s bound to happen. if it’s too unfair for you then just join them.

Well he's maybe a p2w player

Ooo. Draw Frank.

Why un'originale?

What is this shitty post?
---
Yes.
---
I think you're right. Are you noticing a trend lately? Because this happened to me three times the last two days. I thought maybe people are trying to throw their trophies
---
Great so now let’s start comboing regular attacks! This is seriously a horrible idea, there was clearly effort put into it but in general it definitely has no place in the game.

And people like you shouldn't have access to the internet, you see how fucked up the world is? Go back to YouTube, kid

What is his age anyways?

Echlipse channel died because of clickbaiting too much
---
This was the every now and then piper. No wasted shots. Never saw her use all 3 in quick succession. She never attempted to ball carry. Used her super to destroy the wall in front of our goal for me. Used it avoid their Darryl’s and Tara’s supers. She was most definitely our star player. The enemy team had zero answer for her.

14... 15? Around those ranges.

Play him in brawl ball maps which are less bushy and keep your distance from tanks. Super is used to either slow a brawler down to hit him or to stop them for chasing you. Also spike in brawl ball is for defense and crowd control so just let a frank or primo be the ball carrier . I’m a 500 spike main btw
---
tracing isnt art
---
I would like to give Leon another Star Power.
---
Star Power: Great escape
---
Leon now can teleport 3/4 tiles when he uses his super. He keeps the invisibility and the super's time but it doesn't have the speed of the other Star Power.
---
But that would make him OP so it's just an idea...
---
worst indeed
---
noice
---
Maybe not the shovel... Just bats... Bats everywhere.
---
Ahhhh... About that.... Yeahhh I have a different plan...
---
He doesn't have an exact age, i looked it up and it says nothing about how old he is. So technically you couldn't potentiality be right
---
Nita and Jessie: mega turbo laser bear
---
Well it is a personal interpretation.
---
Wow that’s nice
---
funny
---
Sorry I didn't mean to have Couldn't in that sentence
---
It's alright. I just interpret his age anyway. My comic is not canon really.
---
Hecc since when did Colt and Mortis dated?
---
People in this thread act like they have to be either contrarian or conformist in terms of upvoting or downvoting and that by upvoting something that asks for upvotes, the upvoters will somehow lose anything at all. 
---
Somehow the only time I change my initial vote is when I actually think about something for a second. 
---
The person who made the brawlstars clay thing or Cooke frosting star whatever it is was apart of the game and maybe the sub. I personally feel like if I meet a brawler IRL they may share some interesting qualities and have some unique viewpoints on the game and the community:..
---
I wish it will happen

Bad bot.  Lean some physiology, blocking the carotids doesn't make you unable to breathe, it blocks blood to the brain causing you to pass out.  Whoever made you is an absolute moron

Upgrade shelly
---
There fish in the pie, are u blind?
---
Good !
---
Shelly, her star power is great
---
Fair enough
---
Thx.
---
Upgrading 1 brawler at a time is better than upgrading all brawlers and having no coins left. Upgrade shelly

fish isn't trash. i just thought you are calling the berry trash.

K. I just dont have the coins.

Im almost there

Welcome to brawl stars. I'm at 9k and 9/10 of the randoms are 3k-5k
---
How many do you need?

Just got 6 minutes

Sorry for the poor graphic to illustrate any form of comparison, but for the same price, Hot Rod Brock is by far the superior skin. I hope Supercell does something to make Lion Dance Brock more worth it, instead of simply adding fireworks to his attack animation.

And what are these kingdoms in brawlstars? Names for teaming?

Umm what happened?

5v5 should be added too

Looks like the croocked man from the Conjuring 2

Yaa right

thats why when i play barley in heist, i’ll go as close as i can to the safe.
---
Yeah
---
yeah but do you have a crush on it? lol
---
Who do you enjoy playing the most? I’d max that brawler.
---
Barley is better than shelly in rr
---
Wack.
---
i think... upvote 🤣

This happened to me,but with piper.
---
no prob

Then there's those godly ppl who team, then also try to backstab you, and then I friend them lol

pEw PeW pEw

im here

then why did you put a circle around one of them
---
IT'S TIME TO PRACTISE TEAMING :)
---
honestly a minigun wielding brawler would be pretty cool. their main attack isn't traditional ammo, but instead one bar that heats up as you use it. once it overheats, you must wait until fully cooled to use it. not a clue what the super would be. star power would definitely being either more effort to overheat or shorter time to cool
---
Lucy looks like my character idea for Soul knight game ^_^
---
 Baxtrix is so god damm clickbait and his commentary is also so annoying. He just wants views
---
Honestly this brawler would be my favorite
---
Its true
---
Teaming is skill-less.
---
its true
---
Colt's star power is fine because it's actually useful
---
I totally meant his star power! Edited 😂Thanks.

thank you for supporting it :)

All those turrets feels like 5v1 :P

For a penny piper combo maybe the turret could just lob four shells
---
But why
---
I could see this brawler in game, very well done!
---
Forget about the squares. 15 and i will try bull. 20 and i will post Nita
---
I DON’T SEE IT
---
Pootispensor here
---
30 trophies instead of 150? I'm gonna buy this right now
---
Then underatand how they work and use brawlers that can counter them.  All of the trophy road and rare brawlers can counter legendaries in some way.
---
I am a F2P as well, but that doesnt stop me from playing well.  
---
For Spike, understand how the spines from his attacks shoot out, then use Colt to take him out as his attacks are of the same distance as to where spike's attacks explode.
---
For Leon, use a brawler with a spread attack like Shelly or Poco to keep him at bay.  Spread attacks are also more likely to hit Leon when he is stealthed.
---
For Crow, if you are close to Crow, then use your attacks to overpower him.  He is dependent on distance, and if you take that from him, he wont get far.  I would know, since I have him.

Hello! Please add this map to Brawl Stars.

Actually nice art btw

They confirmed that they can't put a brawler/skin in the shop without the timer, but there isn't any offer so far.
---
No problem. You were able to voice out your opinion in a non-threatening manner. I appreciate that :)
---
Yes
---
😢 I’m sad now, how many trophies?
---
Maybe Bethesda is helping to develop this game
---
Why
---
I'm gonna say this again. Life leech wasn't great because certain brawlers, like Pam and crow wo super op. I liked the idea of life leech, but it really just doesn't work.
---
I feel your pain.
---
Pls buff Leon!
---
Another idea but I’m too lazy to actually post;
---
Rico hits Bibi with super, she then uses her super which insta-kills and enemies it touches and bounces around infinitely.
---
Ikr
---
Way to realistic
---
Its fine
---
I would prefer a 100 player-pubg like showdown, nothing less
---
Sorry of my bad handwriting, but I will tell you about her main attack and super:
---
MAIN ATTACK: abstract art
---
She swipes her paintbrush, and if it directly hits an opponent, it will take damage. After using an attack, there will be paint on the ground where she uses her main attack. People stepping on the paint will deal damage
---
RANGE: Like bibi's
---
SUPER: inkoming
---
Lucy takes a bucket full of paint and splashes the paint. If it hits an enemy, the enemy's screen will be covered in paint. and will be unable to see what is happening on the screen for a few seconds.
---
RANGE: Like poco's
---
🥧 here you are sir
---
*jazz music stops *

it used to be my favorite game

Nah i prefer Pollo
---
Yes, I have  this problem too. it's really annoying.

And when he loses, he just blames it on other people. When other YouTubers lose on their main, for example Rey and Kairos, they just shrug it off. When he loses 'Come on, what we're that Nita doing?' 'That Penny should have followed me!' and stuff like that. When I was watching Cory with my brother, he instantly disliked him, and said 'what's his problem when he loses, other YouTubers don't do that'

Thickness is the key

You stole that art sir I'm calling the plague doctors

I don't like idea of super combos, but I think it is possible by a dedicated game modifier or event which supports this

Why I started this fight was because you said 'ding dong your opinion is wrong '.  That comment itself is so wrong . So I thought I had bought myself a customer in my shop of 'teaching people manners' so I started going at it against you. And also you don't decide which apps I use and which ones I don't . You don't even have a right to have an opinion about how I use my apps or what kinda apps I have on my phone  . U also said " wow your life must suck " , how? How do you even think that up, theres gotta be some reasoning behind it right? The reasoning I've done about you leads me to think that you must suck absolute shit in academics , but I could be wrong

It takes something back in my mind... but i don’t remember precisely

So crow basically

Damn i hide this post no?

More Nita Skins woohoo! -.-

It's still cool man.

Right, Piper is like Nicki Minaj thic and five foot tall

There's no right or wrong in opinions, u have to respect other people's opinion

Your post has been removed, make sure to use the body of a post to elaborate on the title.

same here! Single brawler player but mostly have bad skills(some of them are not)
---
Maybe it’s because this is the old upgrade system... it could be... maybe
---
Aw that sucks I only need Tara and Bibi to get all brawlers. Eventually you'll get em.
---
Really like this one ^
---
Its revealed by community manager @RLighton that the skins aren't limited and are staying.
---
It's still a good discount from supercell.I found out that the original price is 100,while usually is 50 trophies.Still a good one,gotta go trophy push.
---
Oh really??? Then what's the timer for???
---
Oh my bad, the joke whooooshed passed me
---
0h n0
---
Yep I was disappointed the pies had glass in them lol
---
hm
---
Tech issues. They can't advertise in shop without timer for some reason.
---
Please draw piper and Bibi
---
Not worth
---
aww??? That's actually really sweet! Thank you for the support &lt;3
---
Umm...
---
Ye
---
donezo ☺, oh and i just tried copying piper's brows in game pic thats why its the shape 😁
---
How?
---
You can't have rarity determine strength in a competitive game, otherwise nobody would play the low rarity brawlers.
---
Mortis deserves it, underpowered shit goblin
---
I bought something ingame.
---
Make Pyro or Spy! they match very well with this game
---
My laughter bursted out and now people think I’m a weirdo in public
---
Honestly I'd also go for bake sale instead of phoenix even if I had enough gems
---
Is this Private Surver because that map is not in the game And Brock has 1 ammo slot
---
Leon + Nita = Invisible bear
---
Are you sure? Because they are there in my game.
---
OMG! Wayyy ! I want to add it
---
I would love to see a game mode that just has combos
---
Maybe wallpaper is better 🤔
---
I disagree, siege is really good game mode if you want trophies with control brawlers such as barley, dynamike, carl, gene and alot more. You can even push with a right team comp almost every brawler in siege.
---
Ok but how did it ramp up so mutch
---
I see this as an absolute win!
---
You are a nice dynamike.... Thanks...
---
The boi was me.
---
Might be overpowered. Maybe you can only stop if you’ve gone eg: 60% of the way?
---
Perhaps
---
Fake if you get two or more brawlers in one chest they need to start with the same letter
---
What the frick is this?
---
Crow: Poison damage is dealt in 5 ticks instead of 4.
---
I played Brock a lot

Yes :D

Wins by accident

Just so you guys know, the idea was my alternate account, idk why I did that either lol.

I checked again. They aren’t in mine

So damn true i'm at 8k and got no legends
---
I'm f2p 😐
---
GG WELL PLAYED :(
---
Comment other brawlers that i should make a skin for.
---
happens at clash of clans too
---
Well how about you start pushing you little bot if you got all of them?
---
I wanted to do that as the title originally
---
6:15 you mean
---
Legendaries aren't necessarily stronger than other brawlers, none of them ar IMO top 3.
---
Exactly.
---
You bet!👍👍
---
2012 wants his memes back
---
Being waiting someone to buy this skin, 
---
here you are 😂😂😂
---
Where is it?
---
Seige is actually my favorite gamemode
---
Lol, the progression is actually pretty alright compared to CoC/CR.
---
The first one are socks change my mind
---
I paid my parents $1 after getting the $1 purchase, and the next day we got notified that we had lost 2k on a game, and when we looked to see purchases, we had gotten 20 $100 purchases on the game and none of us had any bonuses in the game (we got the money back tho)
---
No im pretty sure if i recall once i got 6 mins 13 secs and i got max rewards. Could be wrong tho
---
Hey ik kom niet uit nederland, ik was er gewoon op bezoek
---
Those would be fun. Did beta used to have randomised maps?
---
Imagine buying this skin only for a change of clothes and a pot instead of a barrel when using super.
---
i like to imagine a brawl stars alternate universe where everyone is carl
---
Phew, who would've thought
---
I'm the alt account.
---
Me too . the same feelings
---
That means your opponent is better than you lmao
---
Yep👍👍👍
---
Idc
---
It’s called actually having a life.
---
hol’ up
---
Lol, nice, lmao, lmfao, ok, rofl
---
Adds nothing to the conversation
---
Definitely is cream pie🍼💦🤤
---
When she got released, there was a twitter post I found.
---
Really great art but you should stay away from drawing men
---
* It will takes 13 swings to charge his super
---
* Every enemy got hit by his super will fill it back by 50% (same as Dynamike)
---
No! It would get rid of the ridicoulusly funny clips when Bull charges into the poison
---
Stop playing one week. Supercell rewards u to stay when u show getting bored. Learned this from clash of clans then replicated on clash royals and works here too. First time I remembered in BS I got Leon first day back, second time gene, third time three brawlers in the first two days.
---
That mask looks like anbu black ops mask. Great job!
---
Its called having fun m8
---
That's nothing mate share when you have 6 minimum lol
---
All three are way to OP
---
1822 trophies
---
1822 victories
---
Wat e heck
---
Stoopid bipolar comunity &lt;3
---
Maybe there's a blind spot. It's like that with Poco attack too, but it's difficult to position yourself in this spot
---
Blade of demon destruction flash backs.
---
Barley's is way too OP
---
Tbh gedikor selling his art might prevent more trans skins.
---
Thanks ;) I’m actually just about to hit 150!
---
Ahhh how things suddenly change, noh?
---
This would be super OP
---
combos actually seem like a pretty good idea lmao
---
Maybe trying to actually dodge shots and pick your fights accordingly. Tbh tho, bush camping is not the worst of the worst and it is pretty much the only way bull can shine so I hope he gets reworked in some way
---
Its the Jevil from deltarune
---
Is this a peasant joke that I’m too rich to understand?
---
Bold of you to think it'll live long enough to hit anyone
---
Sure
---
Agree °&lt;°
---
;( #F#
---
i'm just wait bed wars
---
There is hope for me im at 6.4
---
As you should see if you looked at the picture I won as well I’m just saying power is important because they can kill you easier and faster there are such things as lucky shots that get you even if your good and sometimes it just takes one lucky shot to win or lose
---
[here](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/207563386538557441/552149892659675150/imba_cat.png) is something i used on my discord server
---
It gets worse
---
and to eat a banana
---
Possibly stolen art.
---
Even me. I lost 45 trophies tdy and earned only 10. But I lost 45 after I earned 10
---
gene is in the antique shop probably
---
Ha no I was tying to make ppl draw focus to those ppl to show the power levels it was more of an underline
---
Nah I did not, maybe I was just really lucky. Ofcourse I did lose some, but I got to rank 20 easily enough.
---
Seriously ?
---
Vampires don't die
---
It literally has a watermark from the original artist. I never said this comic is mine I just like the format/template
---
Ok I love the enthusiasm but they're not adding it back. Leave it be. They've responded to a multitude of posts and u/supercell_frank said that life leach would be confusing to new players... Personally I think that's stupid because there's a learning aspect to the game and they won't care to lose there 6 trophys on shelly. I feel like they don't want to add it back for there reasons and this is just some louzy cover up.
---
Super Combos would be amazing.
---
Yea as you can see I won against a team with two tens I’m just saying it’s annoying when ppl are matched with you that are much stronger and it just takes some joy away when you use skill hit them 5 times and they hit you twice and you lose
---
Well not exactly 3 pipers but three low health enemies. Such as crow, barley, and piper.
---
Aren't there socks?
---
You could be right but I’m pretty sure they would specially say that kinda like the Chinese New Year ones how they were labeled seasonal skin offers. But they aren’t really seasonal/ holiday offers so i don’t think 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
I guess you could say it is GENE-uine?
---
No pls ;(
---
You Nita stop before it goes too far.
---
Yes it was a new skin from yesterday looks a bit similar in a good way
---

My Penny was 3 trophies away from rank 17, but then lost 2 games in a row because first we got a terrible comb and 2nd game we got a nice comb but one of our teamates was afk. I think I'm going to stop playing Siege forever.

Unless you’re daft you’d see that I was responding to YOU. Don’t have time for your nonsensical catcalling on a concluded discussion. If you wanted your presence to be of any significance, you should’ve come yesterday morning. If replying again to get the final say floats your boat then go ahead and be immature. I need to wrap up my prescriptions.

at this point all box thiefs felt so bad for him that they are just watching over in a bush eating popcorn as of itbwas some kind of movie

Not to disappoint but Gedi Cor already did this idea.  Still nice Ark though

r/CrowGang!

Omg this is so amazing

Not bad at brawl stars, bad at siege. But true

It's a joke lmao I thought that was obvious

That can't stop me from doing it!!!

Crow: I smell tara

gayyyyyyy

Nita + Jessie should be a bear with a bigass gatling gun
---
Ah that’s hot

yeah lets just part ways and kill each other when there are like 4 lefy

Bots spawn back when your dps is 0 for 3 seconds
---
I understand, you get max rewards (32 tokens) at 6:15 and you missed it by 1 second. Please don't consider this Subreddit to be filled with noobs (but unfortunately that's the truth).
---
Luckily, my star power for Piper came in the shop the day after I got her to level 9, and I bought it with gold.
---
Sharpness V Intensities
---
Some ideas 
---
Penny - Any successful hit with penny’s main attack replenishes half an ammo bar. (This should help reward skill, and improve her 1v1 capabilities, while allowing her to be more successful without the use of her cannon)
---
Poco - Hitting allies with your main attack increases their movement speed by 10 points. This speed buff depletes at a rate of 3 points every second. Allies can have up to 30 points additional movement speed. (This will allow poco to support his teammates with effects other than healing, and potentially grant him more versatility in other game modes if the speed proves to be valuable enough)
---
Jessie - When Jessie or her turret eliminate a player, scrap in the form of armor is spawned at that location. It has a 3 second grace period in which only Jessie can pick it up, after that any ally that walks over it can obtain it. It gives 1000 hit points + 5% of the brawlers base hp (So Jessie would get 1224 hp)
---
tell me If you want to choose mortis
---
its worse with a nita
---
its a fucking 6 v 3
---
Do a brock and piper combo
---
I wish my clash Royale luck would come to brawl stars, one time I got a legendary from a free chest then I logged on to my 2nd account and got another legendary back to back, if only I had that luck in brawl stars
---
Happens due to movement while shooting, even without auto aim. It is most observable in brawlers like Pam and Rico who have high unload time. 
---
Sometimes it even feels like they're shooting from their arse.
---
i dont get why penny's one third of a bag can deal the same damage of a whole bag, should it be a third of damage when they split up?
---
I got starpower to my piper from box next day. I have had starpower for bo in shop almost every day but I want to get all power points to all brawlers first so I don’t have 2000 coins :(
---
So you make these solely for appreciation?......You should refocus on what you like to do, and not care what other people like.

Another day, another amazing Kirin artwork! These skin ideas are great, coz one can actually see the time and effort that went into making them. It's great how you've turned biker chick Bibi into a more refined and poised version! Really hope Supercell sees these &amp; implements them somehow. More power to you! 
---
P.S. The 'What If' series isn't over, right? Really enjoyed those as well  :)
---
I’ve seen so many of these kinds of things... y’all just need to get better at siege. Use the right comp, focus on control, don’t go for a bolt if it’s gonna get you killed cuz that does nothing but hurt your team. You’re welcome.
---
Dude I had similar luck too in Clash Royale, but I eventually stopped playing because Brawl Stars is really one of the only games that requires a good amount of skill when in the endgame content (with max level Brawlers at power level 10) because it’s all fair and just becomes a simplistic MOBA at that point.
---
Thanks you too! Also are you romanian? just asking.
---
Of course that Leon in the corner will win
---
Yeah, if you can recharge the super meter, then you should be allowed to use the star power as well.
---
It is around 350 trophies for piper,I'm around 5,800
---
No buddy look up kitsune mask
---
Needs more jpeg.
---
Life leech was horrible
---
Check Ryan’s twitter
---
That’s smart! I only really intend on spending gold for the Star Powers I NEED as soon as the character hits level 9 because they just are levels better with it. The other ones I can just let drop from boxes.
---
Nice job! This is really cool since supercell is finding new ways for brawlers to attack, and since this is a sort of mix of barley and Bibi, I really like your idea!
---
She looks so sexy
---
Its very time consuming art, here is my upvote for your hard work
---
So I assume that she cannot be attacked when underground but can still be seen where she's going, so technically her super is Rosa's super with 100% damage block??
---
This is my SD comp, and ik this is like -30 karma xD
---
You're welcome :-)
---
This inspired by kimetsu no yaiba?
---
Anything that can be done here?
---
Everyone is talking about how OP it is
---
But not how the primos name is meruem
---
Im sorry I though this bug wasn't reported
---
I should get deported :(
---
They should add those backstories again
---
Man,how about duo heist or duo gem grab,or every other 3v3 in duo form,how do you guys think?
---
Dont play with randoms
---
This is me exactly only I just got Bibi
---
It's a popsicle
---
Lol, just found spike
---
El primo's star power should be when ever elprimo. Uses his super the foes affected by it will be stunned for 2 seconds due to the landing 
---
Crows to should be reworked making his pain darts stack up
---
Penny or nita
---
Go to r/BrawlStars and you should see something like "Change User Flair".. sorry I don't quite remember
---
Duo SD is where this build shines. Say, try it on Thousand Islands. Penny drops super in middle, Jessie drops turret at one of the two entrances to mid, and guards the other one.
---
Crow too
---
Where did you repost this from? You can clearly see it from the bad cropping at the bottom
---
Took OP so long to get a legendary they used one of the oldest meme formats
---
Feels good, doesn’t it!

They probably had bad connections just like you

Tara: Card Master: After Having  3Attack Slots Charged While Under 70% health your next 3 attacks Blind the enemy for 2.9 seconds

😂
---
To be fair, you picked frank. Not a great choice either. But gene is much worse.
---
I usually spin a bit when I see someone I *really* dont want to deal with when gathering boxes, as a sort of "please just leave me alone" offer.
---
It’s a meme template, but ok
---
Yes I understand that, my post means to say that I sometimes have a easier time with Siege than say... Heist, where randoms just ping the safe qhen it is like at 90% instead of taking out the enemy AND THEN ping the safe... or in Bounty when we are up like 11 to 7, and they just keep pushing until they die..... am I wrong in trying to defend an advantage?!?
---
ROMANIENS POWER
---
Couch irony
---
Man,I definitely feel ya,I faced the same in both bounty and brawl ball,in bounty,there was a Carl in my team what he did was he went in the center of the map and started spinnin and fed the opponent team with stars,I was just frustrated,and then in brawl ball,there was a Mortis in our team who just went straight to take the ball and then came back to our spanw with the ball and goaled for the opponent team,next spawn he did the same,man,I don't understand,do player like these don't even care about their trophies? Of course playing with randoms does not guarantees a win but it does not guarantees a loss,but players like these ruin everything,they neither care about your your trophies not their own.
---
Since when was this was an innocent lil’ Christian sub
---
It would honestly be overpowered
---
Be gone, normie!
---
weeb.
---
Then maybe don't be an artist. If he's little he can get better, but with all respect for your lil guy, this isn't an art subreddit, its for Brawl Stars, a game. Fan art is fine but this isn't a place to ask for criticism. Go to r/art for that. I hope your bro gets better, but I don't really feel bad for wanting to filter out bad art here.
---
B E Y B L A D E
---
In my opinion Primo is better for Gemgrab Robo rumble robo bossfight siege heist and brawl ball,so I would definitely prefer Primo,but normally I dont play either of them
---
Bought off a custom Rubix Cube website?
---
This isn't r/art tho.
---
Agreed
---
its was over when i made this post
---
This really fits the fact that Bibi is asian but BS style too

not that they wouldn't just every time a community themed idea came up he would just shrug it off and say well we cannot add that feature like club wars for example

I gotta call BS .. I've bought every level pack.. at 9k trophy's .. bought Gene Carl Rosa and BiBi to keep my legendary drop rate up and have no legendaries .. and only have enough power points for two brawlers at level 10 .. sorry if I'm wrong but the maths just not adding up in my eyes

my drawing of dean

I usually tilt more than that before i get the star so that's actually a good deal

Reminds me of old Rico which I like more than the current one so I would love this in the game!
---
Salty aye?
---
Mortis is always the first brawler above super rare that i opened first. In 3 accounts.
---
My ass
---
Thats why she was my first max
---
This is just my opinion and i hope you like it!

Maybe:)
---
Great
---
What is he supposed to be, a baker?
---
That match didn’t have a brawler that has 400 or more trophies
---
##Thicco wants to know your current location
---
You fine person have clearly forgotten about siege.
---
Okay
---
There isn't a single normal looking brawler in this drawing. By normal i mean ya know brawlers like colt,bull ya get it. Was that intentional. Also gj.
---
This is broken*
---
Cool :p
---
this kind of thing is getting old real fast

[Leon] Sneaky surprise:

The first 4 shurikens you throw after being invisible deal +25% damage

Nice drawing :D

By calling me a kid (with context) you are exuding a negative connotation, so I assume that you are a adult? So what your saying is you are an adult that plays brawlstars. And brawlstars is a game made for kids. Nice logic there.

Thx sooo much you the best

Good thinking 🤤

What’s wrong with saying someone is trying hard. Are you denying scholars if their efforts,

86? More like 6.8.

1 Star token for 30 trophies! That’s a 69% discount!

---
MorTIs, bRINGeR Of do0M!
---
All packs are the same from my understanding, I bought the first one and the second one is the exact same, so I’d assume the third would also be 4.99 USD for 2100 coins. I may be wrong though
---
Stop posting requests for people to stop posting request for a report button. It's a thing that Brawl Stars really needs and there's a reason behind why people want it.
---
:) your right
---
K then
---
Sorry but why were you showing us the dynamike instead of the actual action
---
Pulls 7 rosas with super
---
Poncho should spit
---
Nah they not a ship they like tha brotha and tha sista relationship like good friends
---
With a 490 trophy Shelly, on that specific map, enemy team with 7 gems, and gameplay aiming for 9k trophies, yes it’s a legitimate strategy bro
---
Nice teaming
---
I know that feeling. #noboinseige/heist bc that happens a lot to my team
---
Yeah, that Bibi only had 187 and you guys all had 300+, very unfair
---
U know i could of kill him easily but he helped me at 1st so...
---
That'd be for your entire team, sir
---
Bibi’s star power should let her use her normal attack to redirect her bubble if it bounces by her. She wouldn’t need a charged home run bar to do this.
---
Brawl Stars is not even 3 years old...
---
Lol
---
Join a club
---
this is soo good bro—
---
Legend
---
Piper
---
Yea I know but I believe that they aren’t limited time. They didn’t say there were
---
The trophy loss thing is to make people play maybe. Cause if you could win trophies, you start a game, leave to do something, and comeback (I have no idea)
---
