Equilateral triangle is "perfect" triangle?
---
Yay more coins
---
Good idea though
---
sure why not
---
I agree, but give him a mechanic that gives a speed boost after a kill but decrease his health to 3800 so he is tanky but not quite. Also his second star power could be... Dem drives the school bus, which gives it an added speed boost, increased duration, and the ability to chase after people and zone them. As for the name, idk. Hope this helped!
---
Amazing quality
---
I recommend Colt with Ambush as well

well it was a joke but good for him that hes well

Me who can have like 5 more brawlers on level 9 but has 200 coins: Hah
---
This is so sweet! ‚ù§
---
Looks like a puddle blood on the ground
---
First, do you recommend upgrading Pam or 8-Bit to Power Play? I have Shelly, Piper, Leon and Poco maximized, only. Second, I have a team but they are not very good there. How can we train 3x3?
---
Is Penny a kid?

To be honest this will actually be true in the future

At that point i didnt care i was happy i won, you feel me
---
Download videoleap it‚Äôs very good on iOS, but some problems don‚Äôt work, I don‚Äôt have a pc so it‚Äôs much harder for me to edit lol
---
Fighter class I feel like is just a general brawler category, like shelly is very different from jessie, whereas bull and darryl are very similar. Sandy's speed is actually tied with heavyweights, and I feel his reload speed is decent since it's faster than penny/barley's reload. And if people treat sandy like a tank killer then they're the bad randoms
---
Lol that would be fun!
---
tfw one of the least used brawlers have almost the best winrate
---
I have this too, please update if you figure out how to fix it

8-bit not here
---
There‚Äôs a small chance of getting a starpower. Most likely will only get coins.
---
I am sorry to disappoint you but you weren't any better. If not even worse than them. Poco and Spike were keeping control, yes they died a few times yet you didn't really do anything much to help your team other than rolling failing a few times.
---
I agree. Spending on boxes is a waste. If it was gems or gold then things would've been different.

that touched my heart

You deserve them man! Did your nephew really like it? You‚Äôre very generous

Yes! Yes! Yes! This needs to be added!

But she has her old stats back now with just 100 less health, right?

This Was Stage Cuz Why Would There Be 1 Team For 3 People.
---
While very few players will suffer from this now, the fact is that gold does eventually become useless, and in opening the boxes for a new brawler to max them you‚Äôll probably get gold at a faster rate than you can use it.

Hey, if a lot of people are saying it's a repost, it's best for you to delete this before it causes more trouble. The comments will get more and more harsh the longer you keep this up. It's good not to be selfish of upvotes. That's what someone else taught me

The rewards honestly are too small. I think the first five should be 300 coins, the 6th is a big box, 7-9 are 300 coins, 10th is 200 power points, 11 and 12 are 500 coins, 13 is the shelly skin, 14 and 15 are 500 coins, 16-18 are 700 coins, 19 is mega box, 20 is another christmas skin, 21 is 800 coins, 22 is 900 coins, 23 is 1000 coins, 24 is a big box, a mega box, and 500 coins, and 25 is the last christmas skin plus 1000 coins, 2 big boxes, a mega box, and 500 power points.
---
Shelly a shotgunner and Jessie's a turret class.  Fighters are like Tara, emz, sandy, Nita (short mid range, quick fire rate, decent reload speed).  Sandy is the weakest of the group.

i won the next game surprisingly.

Nooooice I got my spike up to 500 about two weeks ago. And now I have more brawlers at 500 than not

Ok, now THIS is EPIC

Hence the reason I hate Brock
---
They cost 50000
---
Nah your English is fine
---
Thats because you havent seen my art
---
Me too, the spike was the best player, but their auto-aim was annoying. In the first 30 seconds you supered into the Shelly 2 times, I do feel the struggle though
---
No, its poisonous
---
Yep you're goddamn right
---
Most of 80 gems don't have attack animation. Unless it is a skin to celebrate something, like lil penny, santamike, dumpling darryl.
---
Sally leon is special skin for line collaboration
---
Actually just like me, OP might not have English as his mother‚Äôs tongue, in which case it is acrually nice to be pointed out a semantic mistake causing you to make the wrong assumption about something. üëå

If this is real then yout doing great but ur post history is really sus seeing as though you have never posted or even mentioned your cancer before

Every increasing prices!

I kind of want a leon attack damage buff not invis
---
I agree but I just would like some more Trophy Road brawlers.
---
At that point just make the games 90 minutes. And add time for every death and fake injuries every 5 seconds for corner kicks
---
Yes you are. People just hate to take the blame so they blame their teammates
---
One modification to make it supercell friendly, make the daily rewards the calendar but modify the rewards so we get a skin offer day 5 or day 25 we get random rewards like a mega box day 24 a big box day 15. A small 50-100 gold on the off days.
---
So far as f2p and 4 brawl star level 10, i bought only one star power and all the other dropped from single chest, hope my streak will go on
---
Waaaay too high, that‚Äôs like giving out a star power every 3 days without trying. I‚Äôd scale it to our trophy road

I personally don't like how everyone hates on randoms. We all classify as a random too don't we? You could just be disrespecting your own self btw..
---
I know the community can be toxic sometimes but I really dont care what they saying they say o you are so trash I go with the flow and say I know that you dont have yo point it out
---
supercell said teaming is a legitimate strategy, so stop crying
---
Oof
---
Ok brutha
---
Dont worry dude kirby was my main
---
XD
---
It's not totally a recolor, obviously I know that but it is not very unique. Golden Barely is 30 gems and provides much more value than this 80 gem rip off. Iris Tara star point skin is just as unique as this yet is being priced as a recolor. My point being this skin is not worth 80 gems. Also the duck mouth doesn't look nice.
---
Leon is wearing Sally's skin and Sally has no problem with it
---
Wow this is perfect
---
Not how it works buddy gotta get good rng from boxes or buy them in shop or get trophies for trophy road brawlers and for skins you gotta get gems for

r/pipergang Nice Name

Cool concept but work on the art.

# "HE'S TOO DANGEROUS TO BE KEPT ALIVE"

Firstly, this skin has different attacks, lots of detail and a little bit of detail

and second: Talk to the line about Sally's mouth, not supercell.

But hey. You never know. Miracles could happen
---
Wait so you won the skin giveaway and entered your nephew‚Äôs account who didn‚Äôt own Leon before so he now has Leon and the skin? Either way, that‚Äôs really awesome of you!

U spelt actually wrong but ok boomer
---
If it was in a normal match then it would be fine because I could get the trophies back in another match, but it is in power play and the matches are limited. People like these should get temporarily banned for doing this.
---
The fact people are still linking my sub warms my little sub owning heart

yea i‚Äôve been the only one flailing the posts smh

I accidentally do that when I‚Äôm attacking a enemy and another pass the ball to me so I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a good idea

Nooo just been playing since beta :) Crows my favorite Brawler I saved up for so long to get the Gold Mecha

Yeah but when you have proof that the person got the ball in the middle and then went into our goal without passing the ball to anyone they should get punished or something similar

Emz was released way after sandy...

But no matter if you use a viable or non-viable brawler, it's always just as fun.

gun: aim normally
---
Healer/Booster: small indicator that moves up and down by aiming up and down (must be aim on teammate to make it work

Super is quite simple: she resurrect, boost herself and boost her teammates (if they aren't dead)

This is just an idea

I don‚Äôt mean to but this on all of Leon gang, I just wanted to point out the fact he was just trying to cover has ass

Who‚Äôs sandy?

my buff to leon is, i would buff His damage from 616 to 750, buff his invisibility time from 6 to 8, buff smoke trails from 24% to 27% and nerf invisheal from 1000 to 900

No because everyone would play for themselves trying to get star player and then you die a horrible death
---
That's really generous of you :)
---
Or.. people who say this are the randoms that need to be carried if they ever want to win a game, I mean no offence but when I am at 18k-20k trophies playing a brawler at 650-750 range and I get teamed up with a Frank at 150 trophies that tries to walk the ball in rather than using his super to break the boxes in front of the goal, I can legitimately say randoms suck. You would be surprised how many people in the range of 5000-13000 total trophies you get matched up with that do not know the difference between their head and their asses. The only instance where it does not matter if you are playing a brawler that have game changing supers or damage, but try playing a support brawler when your teammates do nothing but auto aim and feed the opponent supers and then you will see this meme is just as dumb as those randoms.

Hey man, i'm looking for someone with a lot of game time, pushing top brawlers from 530-550 range to 600+.
---
My stats are on the comment above, i'm experienced 3v3er and showdown. All of my stats are with randoms, never actually played in any groups.
---
Cap out at around 550 on showdown, with a 620 Bull being my ath. 
---
I'm experienced with all brawlers, 500+ trophies on 10/23 brawlers and 400+ on the remaining 13, which i'm slowly grinding to 500s. 
---
Could have some 1v1 practice matches to see how we play :)
---
This offer is for anyone reading btw, as long as you've got some brawlers over 500 trophies outside the obvious Daryl, Shelly &amp; Bull.
---
What is that title.
---
I think matchmaking should depend on one's brawler's level aswell. Getting in a game against 1 or even 2 lvl 10s as a level 2 brawler doesn't make you loose immediately but often kills the fun. At least for me.
---
Nice timing indeed - could have ended miserably
---
It‚Äôs impossible to hear people from distance you know
---
[Visible confusion]
---
Youre doing the good for the world, spike. Clickbaiters dont deserve choccy milk.
---
This should be an official supercell book about brawlstars...
---
‚ÄúNot bad for an old-timer!‚Äù
---
I only upgrade the ones I like, so I don't lack gold.
---
No, brawl ball, I was at a huge disadvantage and my teammates should have gotten star player not me.
---
I haven't been playing CR for years but I remember this event.
---
700 upvotes for a screenshot? Most high effort brawl stars concepts/ideas don't get that number of upvotes.
---
So that means if the spike and el primo had a better teammate, they would have won that match lol...or maybe not.
---
Ahem...If bentimm would open his boxes he would have 1000000 gold...ahem
---
yea

Btw leon probaly wont get nerfed anymore so stop crying...and hes still really good and one of the best brawler for lone star and showdown. If you suck at him, thats your problem. If you dont like it, dont play it.

I never said I consider that a lot and im not flexing, I literally just said how mere 1 is in over 2000 xdd
---
Bunny penny is my favourite skin in the game.
---
XD I dont even have a brain
---

---
Hey mate, 2 out of a thousand isnt bad. Besides, you have three out of four of the legendary brawlers...
---
Give credit to the original artist thief

But you have super üòé

All of these small inconsistencies between arts very probably happens because the 2D artist and the 3D artist aren't the same person and the 3D artist forgets to check these details on the 2D artist's work even though he has to base its own work on it. It happens.
---
Everytime I see this kind of minecraft video, the player place the last blocks so it look like they made it, although they didn't build anything, like here
---
Shen would die
---
Aww, that's cute
---
Yes, exactly
---
It kind of reminds me of those ripoff games with the beautiful art in the loading screen, but the models in the game are not okay.
---
It is Awesome. And I am definitely not saying the models and art in brawlstars is bad.
---
Keep going!!!
---
I am missing only the legendary brawler consider yourself lucky
---
Oh, and should I upgrade him or just keep pushing?
---
you are true,after 1000 star points,I lost all gem grab matches
---
help im trapped in a zoo and people are throwing orange arrows to see me dance
---
Oh no leon has sharingan
---
Not funny
---
&gt;I will continue saying what I want, you cannot limit my speech.

Okay, thats it. Have fun with your block you "I want everything to be free"! whiner.

You know power play functions completely separate from normal ladder matches, right? Shelly has a very similar amount of power play points meaning in power play she‚Äôs done roughly as well as you meaning this is perfectly fine. Also, learn to make a two person comp that can carry if need be. I played without a third and we won all 3 games with epic wins because we brought a Poco/Primo combo(wanted to do poco Darryl, but my partner didn‚Äôt have either maxed). Two tanks(especially Frank) is a super risky move because if your third is someone like say Shelly, you have nobody to counter ranged brawlers.
---
They‚Äôre powerplay trophies, not regular ones

Spread attention in the comments a bit more to let others be aware of the repost, and everyone downvote the post.

This comment pretty much sums up the age of the average brawl stars player

Good bot

I like it(also that custom names or badges or whatever how do you get them? Like for example:you are Crow)

Can be his alt tho

Even I love teaming in takedown. Showdown teaming is just toxic

Wdym that totally works like my friend named himself Leon but he got Crow so now he's crying

I just played a level 10 frank and he hit a lot harder then me. Maybe it‚Äôs worth saving up tokens to see how far I can push him at level 1?

I have only had frank for a week, but I just haven‚Äôt been getting any tokens for him

'Brawl Stars went global' is a thing that happened
---
Jessie but all of her lines are extremely verbouse

He's speaking the languages of gods
---
Thanks I saw it and your was the best and then mortis and I just upgraded jessie to lvl 9 cuz scrappy turns the heat up
---
No max
---
Bruh

Ambush

It also looks like he is giving a massive head to mortis
---
The amount of times I see level 1 accounts is more than I care to mention
---
Okay

i cant play this buggy ass game anymore it‚Äôs literally unplayable
---
Hi

He's My favorite brawler, on my Instagram i draw him like no where tomorrow
---
Indeed
---
atak‚Ä¶
---
Tyler! It's me winds &gt;.&lt;

That's what he implied he meant you can barely play the game without paying
---
Heyyyy, what up mate?
---
Nothing much
---
Bye

I just got around 300 upvotes on my bibi art check it out

You‚Äôre doing amazing work, dude. You‚Äôre like, the only artist I know that likes to draw bull.

Sorry about that, dude

10 pm in my place and I have a quiz tmrw.. I think u too
---
Wow...how can you survive against so many bulls and shellys haha
---
Quiz?
---
everyone knows they arent just going to give out free stuff like this, especially when players really need it, they need money, they want you to buy it, not get it for free
---
Exam.. finals
---
Nice job
---
Oh. Not for me. My final tests are on like 2 weeks beefor christmas
---
Allemand is german?
---
Yes
---
I have a math final exam tmrw and the rest of the subjects r around 6 December

And besides I made this as a meme not an actual suggestion
---
Lwarb isnt on my app store
---
Well, good luck! Btw where do u live?

i hope that we will get star shelly again!
---
UAE
---
Yeah , i dont like it

How is the weAther there? Like 35¬∞C or what

Just a question to the creator of the post: do you like anime or did you just draw this for fun;nice art work

Listen kids, this is NOT how you make ballance changes. This person clearly based his changes on the brawlers he like and doesn't like. He probaly won't admit it though.

10/10

152 and saving  for when Sandy get a good skin
---
Coooool
---
I lost against him 3 times in beta!
---
they were walking together earlier but I just decided it‚Äôd be too long of a clip if I left that in
---
Reminds me of these Google and Bing memes
---
Crow does more damage than mortis in close range , and his super is just terrifying  to even power 10 el primos
---
That was great
---
Thanks! I hope you get her star power soon!
---
He is just saying that he got someone who is actually good
---
Sakura Spike: Am I a joke to you?
---
Glad you like it, thanks
---
I think that it matches...?
---
I have a friend that earned el primo at 7k
---
I like purple rounded eyebrows for shelly
---
I think it will be good!üòä
---
Guess I'll have to go to the playground then
---
Jokes on you, Im bad at drawing humans
---
30 gem skin
---
Hey frank! I heard you are missing frank
---
He does give credits, but they are fake. He just finds someone who was in the match then puts his/her name. It's sad how these kids are falling for his clickbaits.
---
No I mean a Sakura from Naruto

Shit and I stupidly buried my cat, when i could've had a nice meal

Wanna Sprite Choccy Milk?

please do a jojo style
---
I swear to you every match I play, lag is always there
---
Hold up did this actually happen?!
---
Not really, there are good randoms too. It is really gratifying when your team is at your skill level. Sometimes they play even better than me, and makes me feel bad being the ‚Äúbad random‚Äù lmao
---
Im guessing thats jessie
---
Look at the purple eyebrowns! Dude ur repost is doo doo
---
yeah, its f i n e
---
üëâüí™üëç

Per r/thebrawlstarscactus I‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs Spike‚Äôs job
---
*heavy breathing*
---
This is some god tier art
---
what brush did you use?
---
Depends on your field, for some 3D is way faster and easier to do than an illustration
---
What could have been better is Shelly instead of colt
---
It‚Äôs stolen
---
aww oh no
---
Stolen
---
I also dont live in canada but It only took me 10-15 min to change id and download it. Andriod released a year later but you could do the same thing on that aswell.
---
Old darryl in a nutshell
---
now that's what i call a very very talented person, good job!
---
Yes sir
---
Also star shelly was only for players who registred when the game was in play store first time and you had to registre to get star shelly
---
you spelled "I'm stupid" wrong
---
LOVE THIS
---
What else can I do
---
Lmaooooo. What a noob!!
---
A couple of people already said it, but please do a Jojo‚Äôs bull. Maybe give him some sort of stand, and the ‚Äúmenacing‚Äù text.
---
I bet people are gonna use this for a meme template
---
Ok thanks :)
---
It is?! Darn, a shame this thief had to steal it
---
Well, it's not really teaming in Takedown, but whatever floats your boat
---
THIEF!!!! Give credit
---
Brah it's G R O U N D
---
I seriously just had nearly the same exact thing happen to me as Darryl except some Jessie‚Äôs turret finished me off. I swear, this modifier needs to have signals for the rockets‚Äô area of impact (like Boss Fight does) so that we can at least try to prevent these wombo combos.
---
Really nice artwork
---
Mortis √ó Piper
---
did you know you can use manual aim?
---
I hope poco gets a buff
---
What joke are you throwing onto me? I don‚Äôt give a sh** that you got sandy
---
So accurate. Jessies and Pipers are the worst when playing take down. Allways so agressive.
---
Stolen meme
---
Yes I did, but auto aim is of much easier access
---
repost
---
You know that if you would be really the "good player" you have only the chance to get 2 bad randoms while the enemy team has the chance to get 3? Maybe try working on your own play because you are the only consitent factor in all your games.  
---
Or just play Solo Showdown. Then you know it's all your skill. According to the matchmaking you should have at least 550 trophies if you sit at only 40% winrate for every brawler. Shouldn't be too hard.

Randoms in a nutshell

The FBI agent is an idiot. He spelled ‚Äúyou‚Äôre‚Äù wrong.
---
so you know it's a repost
---
You had 9 power ups soooo...
---
No one is special for playing since global
---
Solo showdown
---
You probably don't have experience playing with randoms. Once you play many games with randoms, you'll understand.
---
Because matchmaking is fucked, it goes off brawler trophies, not individual trophies
---
SOMEONE ACKNOWLEDGES VILLAINOUS FINALLY
---
I want a Morris shovel or crow's dark Mecha suit and daggers.
---
The ironic part is that the actress is named Piper Perri.

He said that he found it from a subreddit, WHICH  proves it's a repost

That is pretty cool though
