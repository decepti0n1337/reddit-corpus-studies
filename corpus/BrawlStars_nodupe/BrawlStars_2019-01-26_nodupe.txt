Maybe if you actually looked before you posted you'd see literally every other post is the same thing you just posted.

---
---
yikes
---
he's so ugly now 
---
I think that the Mortis nerf is smart, but the Barley nerf is totally unnecessary. 
---
incognito tab üòÇ
---
Also a colt remodel
---
I Agree with this 
---
So I plan for this to be the last spike skin for a while, I really like spike as a brawler and I enjoy coming up with concepts for him because of his round character model, I plan to switch things up pretty soon, any suggestions for which brawler I should start making skins for next?
---
Ik but not for colt tho.
---
The change is already made
---
See on one hand I‚Äôm glad he‚Äôll look like how his portrait depicts him, but on the other hand,
---

---
Is that a water gun?
---
I loved the skulls idea too, so my guess would be for better optimization maybe? Lots of skulls on the map might not have been good for optimization? Both skull based characters getting this removed makes me think so
---
O o f
---
How can someone not open the game right now? Why wouldn‚Äôt they be able to get on the game but go a website
---
Ryan is just the community manager. The supercell devs are to blame for this monstrosity.
---
How do I favorite a post
---
kairos did it first 
---
Big ricus 
---
Not Rico, it has way more health
---
Dope 
---
Mortis dribbling was high skill gap and made for clutch plays. Not a fan of that brawl ball change at all.
---
So, why Mortis would not be OP?
---
Okay i understand leon needed a nerf; but come on why did you make his super terrible and his damage worse. I mean you couldve just given his damage a bit of a nerf instead.
---
I‚Äôm not liking the brawl ball and bounty changes. 
---
Making shooting take an ammo really benefits some brawlers over others, and ruins the strategy of passing the ball then attacking immediately. 
---
Grass not regrowing is a huge problem because by end game long range will be OP and close range will be useless. I liked the variety of different maps in bounty but it seems they‚Äôll all be long range dominated now. 
---
I‚Äôm willing to give the devs the benefit of the doubt on these because they‚Äôve tested it and I haven‚Äôt. But what I can‚Äôt accept is Barely. PLEASE change back. He had the coolest super in the game by far, as I was telling my friend who recently began playing earlier today. New Barley seems lame and so much strategy was taken from him. 
---
Thicco mode
---
good a Leon nerf. i think his super is good now, but i still think he needs a bit more of a nerf to his damage. guess we will see.
---
He is a baby
---
I don't understand why people like old mortis hes so ugly
---
r/iamverysmart
---
He looks like jessie now 
---
Do you think the change was necessary? What about the buffs it got?
---
What about Dynamike?
---
its not
---
You better start packing your bags than
---
You got that right
---
I think he isn‚Äôt dead in B.B. yet. Bi me able to dribble at all even if it uses all of your ammo is really good
---
They‚Äôre stealing everyone‚Äôs hat tho. Next is gonna be Darryl that‚Äôs a firm bet
---
Wheres the egytian tara one that one was sick
---
Yah , this is where you should stop ....
---
I‚Äôll stick with Rick O‚ÄôShea
---
Colt remodel has been posted several times
---
r/woooosh?
---
I would actually read it if op didnt use caps so much
---
It‚Äôs confirmed, Supercell hates hats 
---
Havent seen any tbh except mine,swear.
---
When you give your friend no producer credit. Smh
---
What do you think the yell at 3 seconds is? A new brawler? New VO?
---
F
---
Correct. I am not a beta tester or am I in any part affiliated with supercell or the brawl stars team. 
---
If you looked before you posted you would find some
---
Can‚Äôt blame them... Leon is annoying.
---
Where's the ice?
---
Out of all the moveset ideas in the comments yours is the most accurate to the actual character! Im keeping it in mind for when I redraw him :)
---
Bottom left also has good box rates.2-3 most games
---
I didnt think Barley needed a buff at all let alone the huge one he got. Should be fun?
---
He was too OP back then (he dealt ton of damage and you could autoaim his super and always hit the objective
---
Spinning is a stolen move from Mount &amp; Blade: Warband Napoleonic Wars DLC
---
Just did a test game. You are right. Thanks! 
---
&gt; I didn‚Äôt say there wouldn‚Äôt be brawlers that would do his job better
---
I did, because thats a big reason you almost never see Crow in Heist and also needs a buff so he can be a more viable brawler to use.
---
Def wait for legendary
---
\#savemortis
---
Maybe like a 2nd star power?
---
Ye that would be dope maybe like instead of poison for crows main attack it be can ice that can freeze ppl every noe and then?
---
Thank god. Now barley isn‚Äôt required in every heist game and when ur opponent has a barley and u don‚Äôt u have a fighting chance
---
Or u can make them like a 2nd star power option!
---
Umm its upgrading not upgrade lol
---
‚ÄòTornado turns‚Äô
---
I almost never reddit and yet all you wooshing idiots are killing reddit. Along with every other site it‚Äôs spread to
---
your barleys skin is just INSANE. if its not in the game in the near future im going to be really mad
---
He was my favorite! Love the idea :)
---
Nah, I was referring to the fact that they were going to rob her obviously
---
If anything, we could switch some of Spike's damage for HP. 2400 is disgusting. I feel he could do less damage for, say, 2600 -3000 base health.
---
Balance changes video
---
You forgot ice cream spike 
---
What the heck is that? This was bad before global release and it's interesting that it's apparently not getting any better.
---
You're a real artist. 
---
I think that is a skin of summer
---
\&gt;wo
---
The skulls change seems like a buff...1800 is huge, and will help in 3v2s, and against SD teamers.
---
I doubt it's Rico, this one's gun is smaller and different colors. While Rico's is just a grey rifle with a orange scope lens. Unless they remodeled him, this is going to be a new brawler. (Also his head isnt that much of a box, its more Diglet-shaped).
---
No offense taken. Good healthy debate.
---
I see what you are saying however I‚Äôm also concerned with the removal of the skulls. I think it was a horrible decision for life leech and it may be here as well. As they‚Äôre aiming for him to be a stealthy assassin, he‚Äôll feed off brawlers with/at low health which means most of the time he‚Äôll sneak attack them taking little damage. When the star power healing comes in handy is when you are on the run with low health and need to grab some to heal up. Only time will tell how that plays out though. 
---
They‚Äôve been trying to change him to a stealthy assassin for a while and have consistently come up short. And now he‚Äôs not even good at brawl ball if he remains weak after these changes. 
---
And Rico too. He is fat now lol
---
ba dum crash
---
u/BrawlStars_Support. Thanks for always being nice to the users and when I read this, OMG... you basically made my day &lt;3
---
Wait people play this shit? 
---
Oh god of fuck oh no he can‚Äôt hear us he has fire bottles
---
True
---
Ruined. He wad such a cool design too, i loved him and i wanted remodel kinda like Barley got, but yeah, it is sad but it is real
---
Everybody ignoring the fact that they used the old theme in the video
---
Sitio do picapau amarelo
---
rip my boy crow
---
Damage buff and star power change...
---
Oh, that's cool
---
That would be a great crossover skin
---
Looking for some new people to play with. I‚Äôm sitting just under 5,500 trophies, and still have 5 brawlers locked. Hope to see some new faces!
---

---
You know that Poco is the next one, right? We don't have time to cry bro
---
Yeah and thats a problem overwatch had when they had this concept. I think with some visual cues it would work though.
---
He did but his damage no longer stacks 
---
"I DO NOT COME IN PEACE"
---
If you look at his icon when selecting it looks more similar to the new one
---
u/ryan_supercell
---
I'm crying and shaking rn. They ruined my best boy Barley. 
---
When is this update coming?
---
It's good  meme material /s
---
The change is an overall nerf
---
But *THICC* rico is better
---
No crow buff : (
---
No u
---
Either end of January or beginning of February. Basically sometimes soon. They usually start releasing sneak peeks like this a few days/a week before an update 
---
I just hope that this is Darryl without his barrel, and we kinda have evidence, right?
---
That one question in the Comunity Round table, "Bla bla bla a genie appeared and he took Darryl's barrel, bla bla bla, don't ask"
---
Idk i'm just trying to not believe
---
Maybe with the hat but they took that from us too
---
It was an ad
---
so he finally hit puberty
---
put ads on the ad 
---
It‚Äôs too easy to get to level 5, star powers are supposed to bring something new and exciting to the brawler, and should b something special, not something easy to get.
---
She heals and deals so much damage it‚Äôs not even funny....
---
Well, we still don't know if there is going to be new skins
---
it's mortis all over again
---
but well... he's bald and also a robot so...
---
Remodeled brawlers usually mean new skins so I hope the skins are good
---
Yes.
---
I can see where u are coming from
---
Exactly
---
But as of right now thiqqq Rico with no hat is no bueno 
---
You forgot to put ‚ÄúSupercell‚Äù in the car
---
Not a bad start! I know it's unpopular but I don't believe Leon needed a nerf.
---
Shit man that sux. My buddy got his first Legendary at 102 tho. Im at 6k at lvl72 without legendarys and Tara
---
It's obviously rico
---
Look at the gameplay shown when they have Bo walking around and getting hit by Piper's mines. His cap looks updated but also has some glitches that don't currently happen in-game.
---
Yeah, but you never know.
---
[removed]
---
So it‚Äôs not a genie üßû‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 
---
Most likely
---
And I thing it can be a hooker too
---
Or the people who are going open him in the boxes they saved for the new brawler.
---
Wow. Calculations. 
---
Let‚Äôs see! What‚Äôs inside!!!!! 60 coins, oh 
---
Umm balance changes 
---
No we didn‚Äôt 
---
Does this mean Barley's super will deal much less damage as well as make him no longef able to kill all brawlers in the game?
---
Say OP that does not have leon
---
This Kent2D dude is actually amazing at this. :o
---
Ugh
---
my god, u dumb
---
#refresh
---
I heard the decrease would be big if the rarity is high,true?
---
it's not. I have NEVER watch &amp; read any JOJO's books and animes. don't know why guys usually talk about my works are  after Jojo, Haha.......üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
These changes are great! Thanks supercell! 
---
yeah,not gonna argue with that
---
Maybe 5 gold per battle, so that F2P will have way to earn more gold by spend more time in the game. Also, if giving gold for winning is too much,put a cap on every day gold. Maybe 200 gold per day.
---
Yes, i know Brawl Stars is pretty F2P games atm,but this game will involving throughout a year,much more brawler will come and we still need PP to upgrade them. Maybe today you have 100k gold bc you are already max,but soon may need golds again.
---
Please consider my idea,thank you for reading :)
---
P/s:English is not my language,sorry for bad english.
---
Not quite :(
---
Calm down bro, its not like Supercell just made him bad at his best mode and didn't gave him any sort of buff or change, he did get a lot of changes that should make him more viable in other game modes. 
---
And also, now that they made Mortis "bad" at Brawl Ball, they can buff him better. One of the reasons that Mortis have been bad for so long is the fact that if you buffed him in any stat, it would comptely break him in Brawl Ball. That is not a problem anymore, that is acctualy good for him, kinda like when Darryl gor reworked to be played otside of heist.
---
Take it easy bro :D
---
Lol the chicken shelly and primo on the left. I like the idea.
---
just hit 7k, with nor mythics or leggies.
---
aiming next for legendaries
---
I did... 99540 is what it says
---
Man I hope it isn't a Rico remodel but rather the new character, but with the fact that it has one eye, is a robot, and has one gun, I sadly think it's unlikely... );
---
Thx
---
Yeah, i honestly believe that the ammo use on brawl ball is a direct nerf to mortis, he uses his ammo to get to the ball, unlike El primo or Darryl, he's definitely nerfed on brawl ball, and honestly I still don't see him reliable on any other mode asides surviving top 4 on solo showdown
---
No you will get put in the blacklist 
---
Yeah, still would like old Rico to be a skin
---
I got my first legendary after 8 months of playing
---
I‚Äôd categorise it under what Tara is categorised as. The zap is just a mini stun
---
Rico's change is only to its atk dmg not max health so i dont think thatll affect the healing factor
---
That‚Äôs insane! Darryl finally looks like a beast!
---
Bring back that of music!!!! 
---
Like so brawlstars reddit sees 
---
It's pretty hard to capture in photo.
---
Try and look at near this time and it's clearly a Brock with a black hat
---
Next up is poco ;(
---
Projectiles cannot pass through. I‚Äôm unsure on exact stats of the brawler. Feel free to explore
---
I can see him being much more used in Showdown and maybe even Gem Grab or Bounty. Idk, i think he still needs a buff to reload speed since it is not a problem anymore. 
---
Didn't wanna let all those years of learning math go to waste 
---
Crow has low damage and he's a legendary? I think his super makes him legendary enough. In every and any SuperCell game Legendary hasn't equated overpower. Let's not get that confused. 
---
Nice job removing the only fun thing in the game, brawl ball mortis.
---
it's real not.üòÇüòÇüòÇ just after looking Bull's figure in game so I sketched it. I just try to let cute style in game become real style.
---
XD
---
Yeah that‚Äôs true. It‚Äôs just so painful when you hit all your shots and then you cant do anything 
---
So you need his Star Power to play him and you can not play solo?
---
Ain't he labeled "Toxic Assassin" for a reason?
---
&gt;Poco can heal in 2 ways and kill and have higher hp.
---
&gt;Pam has high hp and also heals in 2 ways and have a way higher dps.
---
Support doesn't mean weak in any way.
---
Btw thanks for this polite way to express yourself something not quite common here. Despite the way it's shown no ill feelings here.
---
Sounds pretty Sickochet
---
haha

Thicc BOI
---
I approve of this
---
Ahahaha that‚Äôs hot
---
Mortis is a very good gem carrier.....his ability to dodge shots makes him a high skill cap....but it's just impossible to kill him if u time your dodges well...overall he can't kill a shotgunner or fighters ....but still his buff makes him more viable for gem grab
---
Nah, i think that if they didn't touched his super he'd be fine
---
Bo's star power didn't get nerfed 33%, it was nerfed 50%.
---
It used to give 4 extra vision tiles now it gives 2. You can't count the 2 tiles of vision every brawler has as part of the SP because bo has them already at lv9.
---
If you count those 2 standard tiles then one could say nerfing it 66% gives him 2 tiles of vision. How come a 66% nerf would equal a complete removal of said Star Power? It's because of the false premise that the 2 standard tiles of vision are part of the star power. Which they're not.
---
TL;DR: bunch of star power buffs, probably final fix of brawl ball, weak brawlers get stronger
---
What, Moths will love this brawler
---
Source?
---
He also seems to move faster than rico.
---
LOL
---
Yeah that‚Äôs cluster bombs
---
I think this skin is on Rico
---
The meta is bushless!!
---
In none of the comparisons I actually have the same amount of hp so I think we can still confirm its rico
---
How do you know Colt is power 10?
---
The star underneath him.
---
The buff will make me use Darryl lol
---
Wear mortis hat.
---
Finally I know what that star means
---
Jessie..
---
I think they weren't able to buff crow without making him op.....due to his high movement speed he really irritates....quicker super reload and a small damage buff was needed although
---
I love his poison mechanic....it just makes him so different....coz even if u hide in a bush....that poison ticks reveal ur location
---
I just hit 4000, but i have just piper.. no motis no frank no pam no etc..
---
He has some weird things going on, like the fact that his chin is inside his arm.
---
No love for Thiccochet?

---
What does Supercell have against hats? First mortis and now rico
---
But they made him thick 
---
Is this his new look
---
Well done, comrade
---
I already have it, it's the shadow of her Star Power xD
---
Right? He's really fun when played properly, bouncing all over the place 
---
Lmao wtf you aint teaming with leon? Nobody teaming with bull tho thats foe sure.
---
No it doesnt
---
Leo  didnt even get a big nerf
---
It's funny because it's supposed to be lower cased which is hillarious to me
---
It‚Äôs also a huge nerf if there‚Äôs a character running down on you, like a primo or something 
---
My boy Mortis' ability to try hard brawl ball will be soon removed 
---
Quick mafs
---
That's it?
---
To add to the other response, you wouldn't want that high poly model in game unless you enjoy poor frame rate and battery life.
---
They finally nerfed Leon 
---
HOLY FUCK HOLY FUCK HOLY FUCK OMFG

RIP
---
Oh üòî
---
That's probably Rico's son, Fatchet.  
---
Jokes aside it might just be a new brawler. Idk just my guesses.  
---
As for the brawler changes they seemed good for star powers but they needed to fix other brawler's as well. But let's talk about one brawler: Barley. Oh boi I can go on for days on why I feel this will destroy Barley.  
---
You know, Barley was a very solid brawler for me. I always looked at him as strong in heist but never op. He was great in certain maps but eh on others. But this super stacking nerf destroys him completely. He's not good on heist anymore. Furthermore, he's screwed against close-range Brawlers, and his super is no longer that good in gem grab maps for doing things like killing gem carrier. I can go on and on for this but hey, MAYBE his rework can do something. But if he's weak I'll just...never use him.
---
Whats f2p
---
I'm still noob at 3D
---
For 3 seconds, doesn‚Äôt make that much difference. Skilled players will be able to avoid the super completely, and the damage will be minimal
---
They could make a brawler who‚Äôs main attack is making people lag and people wouldn‚Äôt even notice
---
When Its out?
---
yes, yesterday
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Where can I see the skins? 
---
It‚Äôs rank based
---
MORTIS GOT BUFFED SO IDC
---
I'm in love with the very fist panel. THEY LOOK SO CONFIDENT
---
That needs to be bos skin 100%
---
I totally agree with you. I wonder what their thought process was. What is the reasoning behind this, as they must‚Äôve thought this
---
change makes the game experience better. My only idea for it is the map doesn‚Äôt look as great when walls are destroyed and the grass grows back, as the absence of walls makes the grass look peculiar. Another reason would be it creates different strategy, but not necessarily better strategy.
---
This should be in the game 
---
q4:- plz add replays i really wish to learn from my defeats about what i did wrong or how i could have done better.
---
BO NEEDS A REMODEL WHY DONT U GUYS UNDERSTAND
---
The damage buff is really really good, but the rework is definitely bad because he won't be able to heal as much anymore.
---
omg that is star power   
---
the normal frank did not get a buff
---
yea
---
Yup
---
Where I‚Äôm at most people have their star powers. 
---
gem mine*
---
Is this date real? because its too close.
---
Ok well that's just rude.
---
No croow -_-
---
Go Go Inspector Mortis
---
Rico became fat
---
So if they all land on top of each other it'll only do 5 ticks of damage.
---
I have an idea for a few brawlers, which would be great:  
---
Well it used to be. But they nerfed self healing brawlers in life leech like barley, pam and poco
---
Use him to grab the ball then pass it, proceeding to go mess with their poke and aoe afterwards instead of dribbling the ball all the way to the goal 10 seconds later?
---
Nooo
---
I think it doesn't anymore because when u click on info it says robot coming from all sides.
---
For clubs you could request power points/gold/tickets and mabye tokens
---
You can already use Discord for that
---
It‚Äôs working. Just tried it
---
It‚Äôs working. I just did it 
---
LOOOOOOOL,big boi rico was getting fed, NOM NOM NOM
---
Stop complaining
---
Yeah, his star power is super underrated. In a 1v1, it essentially gives u a 600-1000 hp boost and it denies crows poison effect 
---
Thanks for letting me know
---
...
---
If u got another friend we can do it together
---
So he's now unplayable and mortis is going to wreak havoc on the lower tier players.... Awesome sounds like great changes. 
---
Oh, ok!
---
Well they ruined melee and shotty brawlers in all other game modes in the process.
---
What was the old cheat?
---
&gt; 1453 HP
---
*Sad Byzantine noises*
---
Today I was playing the new Robo Rumble event and " surprisingly " a c**t decided to NOT play the game. He was a primo he fought till he got his power and then jumped into some closed rocks and went off. The bot couldn't do anything about it and the robots didn't kill him or go for him. He just got 3 minutes of robo rumble event without doing anything.
---
Awesomeeee!!!üí£
---
Elprimo's jump on the top of map
---
Oof to the primo trying to help
---
&gt;kicking uses one ammo bar
---
thanks god, fuck mortis and the running with the ball behind their goal for 1:30 min
---
Rico+ Piper? i would draw piper+colt!üòç
---
Yeah it's Rico living up to his icon picture 
---
What was your comp ?
---
Maybe add some Gold boxes that have more health than  the ones in Showdown but Drop gold? So there are some other Spots to Contest over
---
Why can‚Äôt I put a flare on myself ?
---
Forgot to mention, Really like the idea, looks super fun 
---
if its that easy then there should be no problem for you to go all the way to the top...

I hate the remodel

then go and look for a good club where you can meet other players that can group up with you...  none of the pros just got good and every other pro invited them to play with them.. if you want a good team, work for it

Its a glitch hes trying to help dont go near him

Same i mean look how fucking skinny his arms are and how ugly his guns look

Can u help me get this time

Why?

He looks... younger?

Wdym. His star power got nerfed and now he can't dribble. His damage buff barely matters.

Still doing?

I can understand how El Primo can go there but how can he get back?
---
Sir, I have a family. My wife Karen left me, and I‚Äôm only making 7 JahCoins an hour. I can‚Äôt afford anything. Please, for the children.
---
No, we don't. :)
---
Guess we have to accept it then...

Their super is ready.

Well I don‚Äôt think you understand what jah scarified for us. He died for your sins and if you‚Äôre going to disrespect him like that you will be sent to the Jah Chamber

How did u do it?

amazing
---
Oh now I feel bad for breaking then out with the bosses rockets. 
---
Rooms full. Hmu if you need another
---
Legendaries should be harder to play and have slightly higher potential. Leon is good at all ranges and takes no skill.
---
Get to 9k 
---
oo nice f2p players can get new brawlers easier xD
---
What are your legendary chances? 
---
3200
---
New balance changes.
---
When passing the ball you now use up one ammo, which means mortis can only dribble once with full ammo, so he isn't good anymore.
---
He can‚Äôt get back 
---
He doesn't. He plays bait safe behind the wall.
---
Just finished the game
---
If he was buffed AT ALL, it would be stupid not to play him. He needed nerf...
---
Check now
---
Yes where is it?
---
Opened 50 boxes after grinding robo didn‚Äôt get a thing 
---
Is there a way to make sure this works 100%of the time? I got the el primo part down but sometimes too many robots spawn around the bottom and rush up to the safe and sometimes it's too much to defend with 2 people once it gets to the 5 minute mark
---
Basically what happened is my friend and I were trying to do the exploit with dynamike + nita bear. I got super before nita so I went up and used it on the wall. Then the boss spawned and as you can see it got a little confused
---
Ryan is bald
---
Ayyy I'm in Mutiny Retreat too
---
I'm not saying he didn't need a nerf. I'm saying that this nerf is damaging enough to Leon, and that a worse nerf doesn't need to be issued
---
Same thing. Room full
---
Just saw it on that post who wanted to exploit it.
---
Please tell me that this is the new Darryl holding one gun and not Rico
---
I love this new model!!!! You have my big upvote!!!
---
A lot of players mustve wanted to experience it
---
In my opinion, he wouldn‚Äôt be significantly stronger in showdown since he still can‚Äôt out-damage the Bulls and Shellys. It would only make him kill weaker Brawlers faster.

In most tier lists I've seen Piper is considered better than Brock at Bounty so I don't feel I can agree, but oh well.
---
Pam is ok i think?
---
I did a little digging and found that if you go to the channel banner there is a thing that says 3:30 „Ö£Îã§, translating to 3:30 pm. 3:30 pm is 1:30 am EST (my time zone) which is when this was when this date was leaked. That being said there a chance (since the Korean BS channel is an official BS channel) that this date could definitely be real.
---
Who won the match?

Brock has a better super, reload speed, and he has AOE.

Did the Nita mike bug work tho?

add me: AM #V0V9UJU

Lmao, no. Just imagine them making a entirely new brawler but at the head they just said fuck it and slapped on a ricochet head. That‚Äôs obviously not what happened. They also wouldn‚Äôt have the first tease of the brawler be in the balance change video.

Adding you now
---
Even if they put a news update out stating that teaming goes against supercells fair play policy i think would be a good thing.
---
Even if they didnt have something in place as punishment, coming out and saying its not okay would go a long way.
---
Ive never seen anything from the brawlstars team about their position on teaming. Maybe they have but i havent seen it and if they havent i think that's a failure on their part by not addressing something that is ruining arguably the most popular game mode.
---
Awesome skin!! Really good job man! But I wanted to see Barley‚Äôs robotic face more 
---
\\o/ u/Frank_Supercell
---
Even if you halved Leon‚Äôs ability, and cut his attack damage and speed, it‚Äôs still way OP. Once he has his special up and finds me in showdown, it‚Äôs instantly over in 1 attack for most of the brawlers I play... my suggestion would be to instead he be completely invisible, make the invisibility pulse on and off, so you know he‚Äôs around but not exactly where he‚Äôs going to.
---
Also, it‚Äôs very difficult to play against certain brawlers when you‚Äôre certain brawlers. When Mike or Barley sees me in maps with lots of walls, often I‚Äôll have nowhere to run and will die within the first 10 seconds of the game.
---
Also, some brawlers take sooo many shots to break a crate, they really need a crate bonus to make things more balanced.
---
Oh, thanks dude, I predicted that because this is his damage in the BS official trailer, and it was like that for a long time
---
This is by far the best Nita drawing I‚Äôve seen.

Yes

Welp theres goes my hot former pool boy rico skin concept

Most of the time that‚Äôs not the case, I‚Äôm in a bush in showdown and he‚Äôs just running around checking all the bushes while he‚Äôs invisible. He sees me, 1 shot and I‚Äôm dead. Invisibility is such s cheat skill.

El primo charged his super during the first 6 waves and then jumped into the wall "mass" in a way he gets stuck into it. That way, the number of active robots will be eventually less due to the server limiting the robots count and they trying to catch the stuck El Primo. With bad luck, the hardest round will be the 21st boss round.

It's great to be a Barley main

Now he needs a reload buff, his is the slowest in the game at 2.5 per attack. That could not be buff cuz he would be op in BB, but now plz buff!

Nothing was more annoying than fighting a Crow in every match in every game mode.  If they buff him and go overboard I don‚Äôt think I can deal with that again for two or three months

Colt x Shelly,_,

oof

Honestly, they probably remodeled Bo, Primo, Colt, and obviously Rico. Those are the four that could use some new polish.
---
Never U-U
---
Do you open your brawl boxes or save them? If you have many stacked up it‚Äôs worth opening them. As the chance to get legendary brawlers increases each time you open a box and don‚Äôt get one. 
---
For example Im at 2k and recently unlocked Leon but I also have 0 mythic or epic brawlers. 
---
I probably should have led with this but the best use of gems is buying tickets and token doublers. They lead to opening More boxes which means more coins, power points, and brawler unlocks.
---
Absolutely amazing!!

I have a question.. Is teaming allowed on brawl stars solo modes? because there is a lot of teaming on this modes what breaks the game for a lot of players. I think you may implement an option, after you die, while spectating, to report people for teaming. That's my suggestion that I think that would improve the game 
---
Carefully, Jo√£o Faro

STOP REPOSTING!!!!BITCH

Cool bro!

Reported for bad title : doesn't live up to the post.

Wait ricochet is getting a remodel? Isn‚Äôt he just re-balanced?
---
Barley is like that one brawler that everyone gets from a "box" so they feel lucky.
---
I‚Äôm just sad that yet another hat is gone, Rico‚Äôs was my favorite too. Cries in the corner*
---
New model really good
---
Ravioli ravioli don't lewd the dragon lolis
---
Ah I see but I stick to the right side/bottom right so I dont think I'm messing up what they're doing. I've been getting 4m ish with teams recently but the last 2 wrestlers that did this we got 2m and then this one at 3m ish... so idk how well this really works but we ended up getting overwhelmed by the other bots/boss that spawned within the 30 seconds they do this...maybe the wrestlers have their timing off, like maybe doing it right after the first or 2nd boss would be better? I'm not sure, sorry for misunderstanding the glitch.

It's Rico remodel dude...

No. Im not #1 barley player in the world, but im playing supercell games for quite long time and im sure they remade barley because they didn't want him to be played like that.
---
I agree

Why stephen hawking?

First idea is already a thing

oh ok so what do you think i should do mate?

It's your opinion. Im just exlpaining mine
---
do u thinks its the best thing i should do? coz i am currently at 4050 trophies
---
At high trophies, barley will rarely land his super close range on a moving target if they dodge. His increased super spread will make it easier for him to hit a primo, but do less damage. If that's a nerf to you, then fine. But you can't say it's a huge nerf. Especially since he'll be able to do more damage to that primo with his damage buff.
---
I‚Äôm at 5,500, no legendaries. My girlfriend got leon at around 200 trophies :):):):):):):(

---
&gt;Im not #1 barley player in the world,
---
I thought that was obvious already
---
&gt;they didn't want him to be played like that.
---
...Anymore, which doesn't change the fact that now he's even more hepless in close quarters.
---
Let's agree to disagree before we make this futile argument more uncivil alright? cheers, sorry if I was mean.
---
But it's not a problem to kill a boss with 2 brawlers. 
---
The exploit mostly helps with the "late" timer when most of the strong (golden, or whatever color is it) robots are stuck. 
---
My 1000th like for you, absolute masterpiece!

Thanks...
---
Basically. Originality no longer exists.
---
What? 
---
Actually really good in solo sd, he is a passive brawler. Avoid people and it's pretty easy to get him up to 500. He is also great in gem Grab as an agro brawler and he is OP in brawl ball but he is getting nerfed in that mode soon. 
---
EVERYONE hated brawl ball because you could go behind the net. It was commonly agreed upon that brock's and nita's star powers were the weakest. These were changes that people wanted, yet now that we have them, I barely see any thanks.
---
Oh come on. It's just a simple discussion about a Mobile game. Others would just call me #nolifer. It's fun to have an argument once in a while. Cheers
---
Both already exist in the game.

First one is playing with bots.

Second one is Big Game.

Nah. It's dominating and then will have it's time to suffer a bit.

the only thing i like about rico now is his thiccness
---
~~FBI!!!
---
Why is everyone convinced it's a Rico remodel? Where is your proof you're all making premature asumtions. My money is on it being a new brawler.
---
The differences are EVERYTHING besides the barrell. 
---
I still am not able to throw the ball and immediately catch it after all this time... seriously how do you swipe so fast. 
---
Is the bear supposed to look like a dude just in a costume? Lol 
---
~~FBI~~

People managed to get 13:21 by all leaving the match at the last second.

me too

you nice draw of Nita! Will you draw an El primo or Bull?
---
Holy sh*t, how is this possible. You are freaking amazing and fast. Bravo
---
A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one
---
Isn‚Äôt this song still in the game?
---
You're right especially as f2p players. You too! :D
---
Amazing ! Keep it up
---
No they removed it last year
---
There are a lot of people who miss the old models, but i hate all three of them (Rico excluded). They look weird, and simply ugly to me. I am very happy with the new models
---
thank u buddy
---
You good create a 3d model Darryl!
---
I thought I heard it while I was playing showdown, at least a very similar version. 
---
Big Rico!
---
Thanks! Your trophy count is really good. Keep it up!
---
the dev team told that after global update they will be throwing out new brawlers often, and also if u see the sneak peeks and some youtube vid, u can surely make up with a brawler incoming
---
Removed. Keep your post titles descriptive and provide context. Additionally do not use low effort/all caps/clickbait titles.
---
I save them for legendaries
---
Very creative idea, and very good artwork!
---
You sound... Nice... Plus, you're wrong. The brawler in the video hits a health point of 3800. Not even at full health. Ricochet's max health at power level 9/10 is only 3360.
---
It‚Äôs actually cos I could dribble with 1 swipe and he is 552 trophies
---
This feels heavily tara inspired. The attack, the clone, the ninja concept.
---
Huh? 69? I thought it was a xxx tentacion skin
---
How? You trap Nita's bear where the big robot is? (just like primo?) 
---
Where‚Äôs shellex?!

I¬¥m 250 trophies away so I¬¥ll get him when his attack gets buffed

youre welcome

---
I swear, in every game (especially showdown) I always find 5-6 Bulls
---
A old idea 
---
For improve that people sees his post
---
there is a max time for the event, like 13 minutes and 14 seconds or something of that nature...
---
Leon has better range while sacrificing HP..
---
The already nerfed super is trash...go ahead and try going stealth in Gem Grab..it's a either low level chaos, with everyone shooting 360 or a high level play where teams are coordinated and people 'spy check'..
---
#1 in every gamemode?
---
Brawlball is all frank/mortis/brock/primo
---
Bulldown is..well, shelly/bull pretty much ONLY
---
Heist is mike/barley instapick
---
Gem grab is any mans grab and Heist is Leons as much as pipers, imo
---
They shouldv'e nerfed the range (but then he's a worse shelly/bull) or nerfed the damage drop.
---
My 2c.
---
Hope supercell do that 
---
Specially with all the posts about it on reddit
---
Small but good detail!
---
diamond
---
Dynamike is busted considering that a perfect throw is undodgeable 
---
I‚Äôd love to go ahead and try going invis, it‚Äôs too bad players like you who don‚Äôt know how to use him think he deserves a BUFF
---
So everybody that has it basically knows that you cheated though. How is that an accomplishment? 
---
Sorry dud i don't have the link.
---
I believe that the star power ‚Äúrework‚Äù was a huge nerf, the extra damage is irrelevant because he won‚Äôt be getting 2x as many kills as it would be with him and teammates combined, and it‚Äôs useless at high health. The extra damage will help against maybe barley and crow whose star powers can prevent 3-shit kills (barley heals and crow makes him deal less when mortis used to do exactly enough damage to 3 shot). Overall mortis got nerfed bad in an effort to make him more viable without star power.
---
I feel like no one liked this one haha. looks great on phone though, I put it on my own.
---
youstupidideot
---
And yes I made all of his attacks dash attacks
---
I made that design 97 days ago.... he stole it....
---
Fbi is seeing you now
---
BEAR
---
Oh no
---
Brawlers who lose the hat (Brock, Rico, Mortis) get buffed... brawlers who got a hat (barley) get nerfed... oh no
---
S. powers aren't the problem, matchmaking is.
---
doesn't matter, it's having it or not. It's an accomplishment to me because it's max time, it's not to you because you don't think like that. How would you expect us to come to an agreement on anything I have to say back to that? lol.. different strokes for different folks, and we are very different. it's just a game though so no need for arguing bud.
---
I was playing earlier and I saw a primo doing this, so I sat on the objective while our third teammate ran up to el primo and brought all the enemies to the base and we died :)
---
I assume sir has 10k+ trophies?
---
It's too bad players like you who don't know how to use him, can't think of how to counter him and cries for NERFS
---
Gamepad controls
---
1. Left analogue stick to move
---
2. Right stick to aim and shoot (normal attacks). Just aim and release the stick to shoot like you would do in the mobile game.
---
3. LB to attack the nearest enemy
---
4. Hold RT and use Right stick to aim and release to use the super attack
---
5. X for super attack immediately at the nearest enemy
---
Alola spike
---
r/wooosh
---
Actually this is a nerf  to both of them since they can't benefit from someone else's kill now.
---
If in addition to this they make his projectile a tiny bit slower
---
Nice idea I love it!
---
Having three brawlers to defend instead of two will indeed make quite a bit of difference. Will test it out!
---
RIP Barley

So good ‚ù§Ô∏è

Sorry I shouldn't have snapped like that. I can have a short fuse at times. You were very respectful and made some good points.

He prob has an emulator on his computer and just plays on that because on pc you can connect a controller and it‚Äôs prob a windows computer so it can be wireless 
---
Lvl 1 Gopnik
---
Anthem would like to have a word with you 
---
He has higher damage now, that is by definition a buff. He did get nerfed in bb, but that isn't where I play him since he can get top four in showdown just by survivability alone.

Ok, that's fair I guess, but I still don't like it.
---
I know it seems like I copied you but I just got to this Reddit yesterday plus I downloaded yesterday  it's kind impossible that I copied you I'll delete the post if it's too much like yours
---
LOL.
---
big chungus 
---
Ouch, treachery 
---
What‚Äôs your team code?
---
But there is different time frames from when some people got on it first vs the rest of the regions... so why should some places get these things vs other regions... personally I feel that yes all the first region user should get icons since only clan/friends would see that and that's it and then everyone should get something similar to the shelly skin since it's a before 2019 skin that everyone had a chance to get...not in game items have at it, in game items like skins should have been available to everyone like the shelly skin everyone had a chance at.

Tara or Dynamike can make another hole in the south, and you can place another turret there.
---
Only English
---
28, this monday
---
I‚Äôm confused. Making Bo less of a skill based brawler and easier for newer players justifies this ‚Äúneeded‚Äù nerf? Bo was needed the hardest, and max skilled Bo players will suffer the most.
---
Player piotr16500 Leon please
---
It ain't a mistake. They do that on purpose to attract robots spawning on the north. Don't set him free.
---
Pap(rico): So sans, what did you do today
---
Sans(thicco):i went to grillby's
---
Pap(rico):And?
---
Sans(thicco):i met a hot girl
---
Pap(rico):Really?!?!what was her name?!
---
Sans(thicco):piper.she said she knew you
---
Pap(rico):YOU IDIOT!YOU WENT OUT WITH MY CRUSH?
---
Sans(thicco):yea what's wrong with that?
---
Pap(rico):*speaking to the audience*SEND HIM TO THE RANCH!
---
Wow...so cute &lt;3
---
I think he should be a league reward brawler 
---
Not related, but I hate when somebody says "main". It is just stupid
---
And about what you say, yes and no. Her super is pretty strong if played correctly, but at higher trophies they know how to avoid it, or at least don't group up. So yeah, pretty strong but not OP.
---
As a Crow main, a buff would be welcome. Making the super faster in flight would greatly help his role as an assassin. Faster projectile speeds would also be great
---
Yup typical redditors likes memes more than actually quality artwork
---
So like how did u do asking for a friend 
---
Oh yeah yeah
---
No no no
---
2nd Rico: "Im you but thiccer"
---
Thx &lt;3
---
FINALLY, THANK YOU!!! RIP BO #MAKEBOGREATAGAIN 
---
I thought it was Bull lmao
---
Yo... I am just blown away with your artworks! I would love if you got a job with Supercell to add ideas and such. Keep up your work! We love it.
---
Not the charge. The slight growl in the beginning 
---
Me neither
---
I've never teamed and never will, but I usually find them (like everyone does). If you shoot one of them and they are half/low hp, most probably the other one will finish him. And if it's still early in the game and you cant bring one low, you can just run and try to get some gems/kills in the rest of the map. Playing safe is usually the best advice, to be honest.
---
THANK YOU. Making Bo less of a skill based brawler for newer players is ridiculous. #MAKEBOGREATAGAIN
---
This is what I was looking for, thanks
---
I kinda don‚Äôt totally agree with the bo part.I think that with this damage buff he will be more used in different game modes(in low trophies 300 for example)but now that his star power is nerfed he can have another buffs 
---
More damage = less skill based. Revert nerf supercell. #Makebogreatagain
---
His super: drops a turret that instantly heals everyone, and heals every tick, shoots very fast bullets over walls that explodes into a tornado when touch the enemy, allow him to dash to the enemy and become invisible, throws bats after goung invisible to heal and deal damage, gets shield that reduce damage taken by 40%, and shoots out bouncy watermelons
---
Perfectly balanced, as all things should be 
---
Stephen Hawking used to play Brawl Stars? ^^^^/s
---
Still want to ???
---
8 / 9ish. She‚Äôs a great brawler! Her healing station is amazing 
---
That has more health then Rico, and the only thing that changes with Rico, was he¬¥s damage.
---
*So maybe that¬¥s not Rico*

Yeah, I feel you. There definitely isn‚Äôt a brawler I ‚Äúmain,‚Äù but just some I am more conformable with than others. I think that if you really do main a brawler you‚Äôre not getting the full experience of the game. 
---
Thats a nerf to everyone
---
Basically Ryan right there.

And his weight

This happens to me all the time I hate it when this happens
---
Source? I'm korean so I understand korean :D

I‚Äôve been wanting this for so long. Thanks for posting this! Wish I could give you gold dude.
---
F to pay respects

Does it actually give boxes or just a glitch
---
Juice
---
It isn‚Äôt el primo 
---
The best skin idea for bull yet
---
Unnecessary doesn‚Äôt serve a purpose and is more intrusive to screen space
---
Piper is the same as Mortis, they can‚Äôt buff her or else she‚Äôd be too strong in bounty.
---
I suggest they add more walls and bushes to bounty so she won‚Äôt be as strong.
---
That way they can buff her
---
good first post üëå
---
Too bad
---
wow very good
---
No it‚Äôs just an issue from youtube
---
Sure it‚Äôs not just the last half of it?
---
I‚Äôm a gem grab and bb 
---
obviously gives u boxes why wouldnt it
---
Anyone want to help me on this exploit? I have Primo but all the randoms do not know how to do it. Been trying to do the exploit since it came out with no luck
---
In positive. El primo is a grrrr and this is a gahhhh
---
aaaaaaaahahah
---
Amazing, could u do richocet next?
---
(His remodel i mean)
---
I can‚Äôt tell if your being serious or not how many boxes did you get
---
My fav
---
Pls someone explain to me what the primo glitch is
---
For you 
---
okay, thanks for clarifying. So Super will do more damage than regular attack. That was something i didn't get. Thanks.
---
You're giving me don't Starve vibes with "quality of life"

He is bad

Rip
---
Thanks so much! It was a ton of fun to make!
---
BOB, DO SOMETHIN!
---
Can I please give my suggestions for new brawlers
---
1. A mythic brawler call Fang the Copperhead Cultist 
---
 Fang is medium range brawler who attack is spitting venom which causes the enemy to get 1370 damage per spit at maximum level and 3 ticks of 200 venom damage at max level. His health at max level is the same as poco‚Äôs and his super is throwing seven snakes in a bunch and when they hit the ground the snakes spread out from a circle radius of 4 tiles and each snake deals 270 damage per ( only one hit ). He looks like cultist leader dressed in crimson robes, his hoodie has two fang like points and his face show while hooded he has green snake eyes, a snake tongue, and in his mouth has snake fangs. Fang‚Äôs walking speed is the same as colts walking speed when he‚Äôs max out. And finally his star power is second life where when he dies his ghost will assent and will get a 10 second life limit to still do some damage but when fang dies his ghost will do and get half the damage he deals and half the health he owns.
---
So what do you think supercell I mean this brawl does fit in in this game he is Wild West material cause he is a cult leader and copperheads live in southern United States
---
Translation (preferably in English)?
---
Ugh.. ok
---
I will just hide in a bush so i can atleast get some trophies
---
Its Amazing !! Up !! 
---
No, its the right one
---
Normally you'll  mostly care about that maul hahaha!
---
But, he throws two... one would always explode on the time and the other just wouldn‚Äôt always be on time...  it would still be the same gameplay. 
---
Oh yeah! I had the skin before they removed it
---

---
Should have submitted it to the fan art contest! It can‚Äôt be a Facebook profile but it‚Äôs the realest art I‚Äôve ever experienced 
---
why lmao you didn't do anything to deserve it lol, this makes no sense
---
already been suggested before by someone else but still a good idea
---
I have the same problem and I use an iPhone XR 
---
Only 6 comments including this one? Damn
---
I know right
---
Yeah thought so too lol
---
Betrade
---
It‚Äôs the el primo glitch. Look it up and the next time it happens you might be able to last a really long time 
---
Same happened to me. We lost immediately afterwards. 
---
Now yoy wouldn't get any "value" by throwing it up close
---
Its a complete CONTROL super 
---
why would it be intrusive to screen space
---
the button would be the exact same size
---
If only I could actually use my super when I click it.
---
Must be even in the thumbnail there was a model that looked like a genie 
---
Yep XD 
---
Rip ricochet 2017-2019
---
I looked it up, but it literally never happens.. It just results in myself and the other rando having to last as long as possible without a third player.
---
As cool as this is, I can see the dire wolf being used for a separate hero instead of Nita.
---
Glad to see you used a watermark. I'd like to see those instagram stealers try to remove it! Great idea and good work visualising it!
---
Yeah Anthem servers aren't that good 
---
Tell him I won‚Äôt cuz he should push his butt off
---
It's a hack for robo rumble to get the max time which is 13m 14s. Primo charges up his super and uses it to get trapped. Any bots that spawn nearby by stay frozen because he's closest but not available to attack. Eventually the other 2 players just stay by the safe and guard it and there is a limited number of bots allowed on the map at all times. Primo basically stacks up on bots surroding him that are frozen and then game stops spacing anymore bots because it's reached map limit. That way you get max time with no effort. It's a hack that'll probably fix in the next update. 
---
already been done way better bud [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdVdRk0pxpk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdVdRk0pxpk)

this is pretty awesome

It‚Äôs like the Primo glitch, but better. Harder to pull off tho.

Similar to this old idea

---
yea unfortunately i dont think theyll remove it because its become somewhat of a core aspect of the game as of now. at least theyre buffing mortis to better handle it

The pic in OP and what you described are the things I hope get fixed. The most annoying ways to die

Thanks, I hate it.

I saw the post actually but after they edited that out

So basically its official because Supercell does also have offices in Seoul, South Korea 
---
HYPEEE

Where did they said very soon
---
Great idea!
---
Matt, TKO Round 1
---
Indeed! :D
---
Mcree untie me 
---
Thats the official supercell account of Korean Dev Team
---
Supercell have offices in Tokyo, Beijing (I think), Seoul, and more
---
I think this was a much-needed rework. The difference between power 9 and 10s was too big. His Star Power was OP, but without it, he was really weak. I think this was a good change a will help newer Bo players.
---
great
---
U r Korean?
---
as an avid Marvel comic book reader, I can say that this looks like something straight out of a comic book. This is by far one of the best works of art i've seen. Keep it up mate

Then brawl talk is tmrw? Sneak peeks?

there are squares around all of the photos do it better

Just use a lvl ten dynamike w/ super
---
It is more useful and can actually shoot

Sorry I don't know how to insert images I someone can help me I'll be so much aprreciated :D

There's an option to lock the movement pad in the settings.
---
BOB DO SOMETHING 
---
I think bo gets a remodel tho.
---
Decent idea. Nice.
---
So guys, we did it! A tenth of a million subscribers
---
Dang dude, are you blind ? Just take a look at Cavern Churn on your game and compare both maps.
---
So, you‚Äôre on the spectrum right? 
---
Grats
---
Rompes las reglas, ni√±o.
---
I literally wouldn't purchase ANY because ofc they looks "unpolished" and old
---
Congratulations
---
Bo is getting a voice but i don't know about the rework
---
Really funny! 
---
I'm pretty sure this is a remodel because:
---
1. The Brawl Stars team said nothing about a new brawler.
---
2. The head of the new brawler is similar to Ricochet's.
---
3. The health is similar to Ricochet's as well.
---
All that aside it still could be a new brawler!
---
I prefer hatoortis over obese mortis (OBs)
---
Thanks! 
---
Thx! 
---
It's a bot found in the balance changes video and people call him thiccochet
---
Thanks!

Great job as always kairos!

It‚Äôs likely bull, as not only can you hear his charge, but the growl seems to have started right as he preformed the action. Not 100% sure tho
---
u/brawlstars
---
Crow doesn't need more HP, more damage, more speed, or anything like that. What he needs is stackable poison. That will let Crow be competitive without making him too powerful.
---
Omg r u serious ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
That's also quite a possibility. But because she seems to always wear clothes that resemble the style of the native americans more so than modern clothes, I discarded that possibility previously.
---
*wrote and you did not hide an code
---
It‚Äôs really not tho
---
I did see that, but that‚Äôs not the main point of barley. In higher trophies that technique only works on the safe cuz nobody dumb enough to walk into that.
---
Now his attacks are much better and his star power is really good. He‚Äôs gonna be unstoppable in life leech with all that free self healing.
---
NYEHHH
---
Imo it fits well with his ability to bounce shot. A round character with bouncy balls in a toy gun, I understand their choice and tbh, I like it
---
So u r telling me u don't lnow how to put images on another image? 
---
Or u don't have 10 minutes
---
You can

At least they finally fixed his eye. That made the game 
---

---
I'm sorry if I got you mad, but keep the passive agression to a minimum, thxman.
---
Anyway, you can't cry "nerf!" if Leon is broken and is OP in the hands of some pro players or w/e...
---
Since most of the playerbase is around the low trophies, and most use shelly/bull, the whole "then don't go near them" or "l2p" argument is invalid...the more trophies you have - the more reasons for you to know how to play around a character...
---
"nerff leon plz 0.01% of pro players abuse him!" 
---
*90% of playerbase instapick bull*
---
Nice!
---
Thiccomode goes THICCCC
---
the buff is coming:( 
---
Yup. Got it! 
---
Well... Leon is getting nerfed and people are rushing to get him to 500. I don't see what's wrong with last second pushing.
---
Big oofs, nothing better than making people look like fools in brawl ball using him. At least he will be more viable in other game modes now.
---
its okay! its Dr. Pig if you wanna look it up
---
Very good idea! I hope they'll add it
---
I'm pretty sure they will remodel all brawlers in the future, and when they remodel Crow, they will surely improve the skin. Look at Bull and his skin, it got a huge improvement
---
they wont its a legendary skin. 
---
Yeah that looks like it would fit. Could also work the other way around I guess, but then Brawl Talk would be up for minimal time before the release...
---
What's the team code? I'm on Bluestacks so I can't use the link.
---
WTF?!?!
---
Iirc somebody already did it with Nita, Shelly and Dyna, but anyways, people don't know, so take my upvote
---
Create a supercell id once you recover it.
---
Did you have your account linked to a Supercell account or Google Play games account? That could help.
---
"54% goes down"
---
Can you make a video after the update on how to use mortis now that he is ruined?
---
Didn't downvote this post.
---
No, I did not :(
---
No, I did not
---
then don't play him on showdown lol. He's good at gem grab and great at brawl ball.
---
I like how you based the scheme around the dog turret. 
---
BEER!!!

level 5 is more then enough. 
---
Sorry man, I think you're screwed.
---
Not sure they can really do anything, but you'll have to ask them just to be sure.
---
He was already pretty versatile and good if played correctly, now he will be strong. He is really underrated tbh, and I'm afraid he becomes too strong
---
Screen off for 1 minute üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
"great at brawl ball" RIP lmao.
---
Did you even read the change notes?  
---
He meant to do that lol
---
I diagnose this skin with having no hat.
---
*Actually though this is pretty good, I love it! :D*

Wow... don‚Äôt know if you are trolling or if you just an IQ of 2... I feel sorry for you dude
---
STORMY PLAINS V2

Much much better then the one used now. Im in!
---
He was trying to do an exploit that would keep 99% of the bots away from the safe. But if someone comes close to el primo, everything gets ruined. How do you not know about it?
---
It's not really a bug your brawler will be level 2 when you enter a match. If you want the visual glitch to go away reselect the brawler 
---
Thanks for noticing! I tried as much as possible to make it look as if Jessie built it :)
---
I know about other people that did not have their account linked, but managed to recover their progress by telling accurate data (trophies, gems, coins etc).

At least matchmaking is so fast the exit button is useless

lol
---
*F intensifies*
---
Np
---
Hmm that is interesting, although I'm not sure if poison quite fits the overall lore of the character, perhaps explosives? In terms of returning over or under walls, it's more like going around the sides/corners. They don't go that far so it's not like Yoyo will be too far away even if it runs around a corner.  Might still be awkward though haha
---
Can someone add me that has this robo rumble, I am in need of some tokens

*why are we here...just to suffer.?*

I did mean Penny, but as the other poster said Nita would actually be better.

This has to me my all time favorite format even though it‚Äôs so old and underrated

Yea pretty much *my friend has all 3 as a f2p and I‚Äôve spent 5 buckaroos stuck with Tara as my rarest brawler* 
---
I think that most people complains comes from solo showdown where he doesn‚Äôt  shine. 
---
whats this?????

If somebody wants to make a visual design for Joey and post it, be my guest! (Plz give credit to me for idea lol) I don't trust my artistic skills and I don't think I'd be doing this idea justice if I were to make a picture
---
That's such a good point! Current one is way more user friendly to the casual audience now that you say it! That may explain why Supercell would prefer the current UI to something more flashy like this! üòÖ
---
Apart from penny, I will have to calm the fbi for the other three
---
But I guess I‚Äôm kinda lucky cause I blew that 5 bucks on skins and gold and I have all brawlers but mortis and the legendaries 
---
I think I can‚Äôt say :/
---
Nice 
---
chester
---
Sweet, I like how in depth that concept went too.  Might have to refer to that one for the next concept I do.  Grabbing objects is a pretty neat idea.  
---
The real question is why do people play this game
---
by when?
---
I‚Äôll see what I can do 
---
Well...*I can already feel the judgement coming*....I too am a f2p and have all brawlers except legendaries, mortis and piper
---
Thanks! I figured it might be a good mechanic for defending against people chasing you down :)
---
Yes I did but you‚Äôre not finding 
---
Darryl Isn‚Äôt the best in brawl ball but still quite decent.
---
Using his super he is able to dribble like Mortis.
---
Hey can you add me?
---
Yeah, definitely didn't give the star power that much thought.  I was afraid to make it too OP haha.  Any suggestions?
---
But yeah at first glance, it DOES feel kinda cluttered but as we all know supercell developed 5 successful games (2 of those in which not so popular) so they know ecatly what they r doing 
---
Looks cool!
---
yes! and i dont have to go on my second account just because i want to look at my progression üòê
---
I think the book should actually say ‚Äúhow to get better internet‚Äù
---
I‚Äôll do it with you i‚Äôm Uchiha
---
How many people on this subreddit don‚Äôt know about the exploit? 
---
Yea I recently got to 3000 and in the box I unlocked before I hit 3k I got frank so my luck has been good recently but I‚Äôm just gonna have to play robo rumble with random because I have no friends that want to play lmao. And I‚Äôm f2p pretty much (skins give me no advantage and gold is overpriced)
---
But I‚Äôve been observing for a month now and it dead solid has not changed
---
*Hey just noticed..* it's your **1st Cakeday** apollo-ape_! ^(hug)
---

---
