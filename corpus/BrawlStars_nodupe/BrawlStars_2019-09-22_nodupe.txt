This was such an obnoxious and loud way of conveying you want emotes and skin colours. Yikes.

Schooling me today eh? XD
---
We only need feminism and comunism, and this game would become Joseph Stalin's favourite game, Left Stars.
---
Happens to me but with Mortis
---
Ok
---
I used El Primo for 40% of the time (which is also the best Brawler I have) and I didn't need to
---

---
considering most heavy weights consist of just getting close and punching them, yeah no need to aim
---
It should be siege. Anything but brawl ball, it's the worst gamemode by far.
---
Definitely a good idea. 150 gems for no fx is pretty big bs
---
Dou thats It so cool bro
---
Love the idea
---
Not even close.
---
im getting flashbacks of the almighty classic

###RAN RAN RUUUUUU

This concept was a competition for fun with a prize that everyone has a chance to get, if the team considered his submission funny enough to make it in then I dont see the problem. You could argue that "he stole the place of an actually good submission" but its not like this is the only bad one, I think it was clever sarcasm even if it was just a troll or someone genuinely thought it would be a good idea
---
Am I missing something?
---
The account is new, so the person made a new account just for this
---
Advice from me make his star awake

Bruh, I can make scribbles like that, where‚Äôs my 100 gems?
---
Ew i hate you

---
Get out.

You are a gene?!?! ;) Haha

Cool! It looks like Electris from Monsters of Etheria (Roblox)

Irrelevant but ok

Congrats man

There's no point, you can only do it in friendly.....

Brock is black, and Rosa is also black, but with a British accent.

Ouch, spike‚Äôs fucking hurt

And a cactus. Don't forget the cactus.

I don‚Äôt even care what they are classified as

Yes, thank u ;)

It's sooo bad. I'm on 28mbps WiFi and it can barely play. Only rocket league has servers this bad, out of the hundreds of games I've played.

opened 51 and 3 boxes and got noooothing

Congrats!

Piper: I've got a lot of letters
---
Jessie: alot? I only got 6
---
Shelly: i bareley got 3
---
Pam: you guys are getting letters?
---
Most of them were poorly made
---
Same for me :)
---
Got an extra 0 in there
---
send n00d$
---
ok :(
---
Interesting...
---
Why 320, such a specific number
---
Leon needs a rework imo, not a nerf. If there's a leon it basically means random death, and there's nothing you can do about it.
---
Another YouTuber who is a Hat-er, uh?
---
I had a random Piper on my team (power 2)
---
And i was a 8-bit, the other guy was a Rico, i got 4:55, I consider that good since i had a Piper on my team
---
You played sooo bad.
---
Might sound weird, but if they don't play at all, they wouldn't destroy walls which would actually help out the other teammates. The walls help filter the bots and a person like El Primo, which I played in that match, can hit through more than one enemy. Also when they AFK for too long the game kicks them out and a bit replaces them which I would much rather take over a person that trolls.
---
However, I agree with the brain dead players. They are worse than bots.
---
Very nice
---
English?
---
Rofl maybe because you put in a lot of random shit in? Only thing worse about the top one is that it‚Äôs less outlined, colt pupils aren‚Äôt shaded in + colt colors are off. Other than that much better than yours lol
---
Both seem traced so who even cares
---
"fat acceptance" 
---
We all know Pam is weak af right now. And she is ranked as epic brawler lol
---
Piper - habalablablablalablalbalba

UNFORTUNATELY I AM A CACTUS
---
Im going to make every brawler and im only 10 so
---
*Woah...chill*
---
Rico with that GUCCI
---
Stay behind powercube boxes so you can bait shotgunners
---
Tbh I'm fed up of this I'm done with brawl stars I'm 14k with 2 legends I'm so angry and jealous nope nope nope I'm done I'm deleting this game well not delete it I don't want to play anymore I'm done I have 2 legends but not Leon and sandy wtf
---
Any ways happy bday
---
I love how Colt is passive aggressively smiling.
---
Im making 4 each Saturday and sunday

Wow. I opened 10 mega boxes 1 big brawl box 67 regular boxes today. All I got? Coins and ONE star power. No sandy. I‚Äôm salty lol. Congrats!

Man rejecting that team invite gave you the luck of sandy

1)Where are you from?

2)Do you love Legend of Zelda series?
---
3)Do you think that Brawl starts is P2W?
---
They had 2 level 10, we were all lvl 8-below.
---
And thank you for pointing out the obvious, you are a genius.
---
Let‚Äôs keep in mind everything is thought through by a team of devs who know how what they‚Äôre doing. So chances are if it‚Äôs not in the game, there‚Äôs a reason, or it‚Äôs on its way
---
No because I answered before, also I feel like I presented a neutral view

It‚Äôs original, and supercell isn‚Äôt gonna review every single frame submitted. This was probably submitted early on and they saw it and laughed

Aiming is still important for brawlers like El Primo. You want to make sure you hit the right target. If you are chasing a brawler that has a spawnable like a turret, they can drop the turret and your auto aiming could hit the turret instead of them. It's also relevant when brawlers are in bushes and for game modes like heist and siege where you may want to either go for the objective or a brawler. Auto aiming is OK in some situations but you definitely need to know when to aim.
---
No Gene, Piper is also Epic...
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdGGTLRWGnk found something crazy
---
ALLOW ME TO SERENADE YOU SOMETIME
---
Ok now i understand more now
---
No Piper, you‚Äôre a epic
---
Its like asking to make a ray gun 50$, its legendary for a reason and yes 50$ is a reasonable price for something titled "Legendary"
---
Nice tits
---
Nice, I got my Piper to about 40 cubes and I dealt 13k damage per shot and my super did 40k if all bombs hit, I went from last to first in 1 super
---
Yeah.. very dramatic

I respect your opinion and your amazing!!

Thank you

I feel like his super is a bit weak though :/ but awesome idea hope it gets implemented
---
Will there be a recommended team comp in brawl stat?
---
I think Piper x Colt is lowkey kinda cute ngl
---
Great idea
---
That brock gave me a panic attack
---
I did because i watched it at 0.25 and they were a lot of memes
---
Reason y I only got 41 is I had to go
---
I don't understand anything.
---
You still have 2 brawlers to go though
---
MMM, LOOK AT THISE FLUFFY ARMS, those HOT eyes AND THAT COLOR, OOOOOOH THAT COLOR FITS IN SO GOOD, omg so good
---
Oh yea that girl I guess she is cute too
---
I live my own life unlike u
---
Awesome art

Change ur brawlers on their menu, on bots, and tap start before the brawler icon changes
---
Tick fractal
---
Wow, 13000, muchas!!!! 
---
Es sarcasmo, por si no lo entiendes, desde el nuevo sistema de copas, 13000 son b√°sicamente el nuevo 8000 copas, donde no est√°s bajo, pero tampoco alto
---
Deja de usar "xd", es Reddit, ni esos t√©rminos ni los emojis son bien vistos, solo dan cringe y hacen que te veas pat√©tico. Esto no es YouTube ni Facebook, as√≠ que deja de hacer este tipo de publicaciones
---
As√≠ que por favor, si no tienes idea del juego, solo vete. No has dicho ni un argumento en todo esto, solo has dado cringe.

I was thinkin about that, when I see this polar nita in hot, I was like, "wait... I already see this image somewhere... Take my downvote and GET OUT"

How insulting. The splotch of gray in the corner is the ONLY thing anyone should pay attention to. Oh how dare you diminish its significance by talking about the coat. I feel deeply betrayed.
---
Where's *Ricochet*
---
Amazing idea! The first match I played, I thought about something like this. They could also just teleport it to the center each x seconds, or something similar, because right now RNG is a huge part of the gamemode, and that's not a good thing for the game at all
---
It's ok I like it

I Love this, i love bibi, very cool

that's true, but that doesnt mean you cant play the game if you dont lol

Tough bro. I got super lucky. I still haven‚Äôt spent money but saving up your boxes until new guys come out usually is worth it.

I was going to comment that

This is a stolen art

Nope but the showdown

awww niceeee

Ah yes the uno reverse card, I've been fooled once again.
---
Yeah sure... Sandy is **focused**, yeah... totally
---
Something's wrong with matchmaking
---
needs some balancing, but really cool!! 
---
(he may be too much like bibi...)
---
I already addressed why he should leave it up.
---
Nita would be invincible
---
You tell me, were you saying that i got carried up here bc im 6 yes or no?
---
Not many people like siege . Thats why seasonal vote i think will bring more variety to the game
---
I can‚Äôt say for certain but you should get the items
---
Dynamike: *Yaaaa!*
---
What the cinnamon toast fruc is this
---
I think so.
---
Removed. Rule 5.
---
Accurate. How tf u not have p9 at 120+ like how
---
Im like 150+ and Im f2p with every brawler p9+
---
(No sandy)
---
Why does it matter? I think they have better things to do....
---
ok, just for clarification, no I was not saying that, I was talking about the ones that basically are throwing the game by dying and being stupid, star powers doing really anything if your just bad. just actually have people with star powers is nice.
---
No
---
I don't think the top is better, but you're wrong. You can criticize art without being an artist. You can tell food is bad without being a cook. You can notice when something is poorly designed or built.
---
#stahp
---
I smell a scammer just saying. Hopefully I'm wrong...but this appears to be this player attempting to scam the system and outplay them at there our setup.
---
Makes a purchase...and someone mysteriously asked for a refund ...TWICE...
---
How strange.
---
This is really good.
---
Yeah, probably, I was just a little pissed about losing trophies
---
Why tf is Penny naked
---
Lovely
---
*FURRYS YOU SAY?*
---
I‚Äôm thinking about this for dynamike too!
---
That carl...
---
Like I said, anything but brawl ball and I'll be happy. I don't even get the star tokens anymore, it's not worth the losses. Thinking about it for a minute though, I dislike brawlball because nobody knows how to play it properly, I also say this about siege all the time.
---
If he resolves it with apple or whoever...soon as it's resolved ..I'm pretty sure supercell could reset his negative gems back to zero or wherever he left off to begin with.
---
It's not there call which is why they made a decision to stay out of it and let apple handle it.
---
Piper and tara?
---
Wow nice brawler! The art is COOL!
---
hmmm, really depends. if you're going for views, people want the clips and for them to be shown once you have a decent subscriber account. but if you enjoy making high quality meme edits and hope for the best, you might just get subscribers. I dont think people watch commentaries unless you're actually funny, do meme edits, or just famous, or a girl I guess.
---
Ohhhh it totally sounded like you were attacking me bc you said lvl 1 noobs, and im lvl 6 so yk. But yeah thats true and it makes since bc alot of times after i win i play again with the same randoms n they throw the game off like wtf that how you know i carried them or they played good for once in their life the match before

Well done!

Me too bro, you know what lets play together n carry that one lucky random so that he can go throw games off last minute for other ppl at 900 lol but fr send friend invite

I want my Rocky!
---
What is that?
---
It also possible that the gift card is bought by stolen or fake credit card, and then the seller will sell the gift card on the internet for much lower price. Usually gift card is harder to trace, it means the end buyer won't always be affected. But it all depends on whether Apple wants to track. Is the gift card cheaper than its value?
---
Did supercell confirm they aren‚Äôt family?

There‚Äôs always a bigger fish

At least you HAVE legendaries. I've wanted leon since I started playing, and I know I'd be good with him, but NOOOO. Supercell says "YEET" to my luck
---
All of ‚Äòem, actually
---
The most talented man in the world today. Astronaut, doctor, engineer... you name it he‚Äôs done it
---
Lone star is not a very fun mode, it's easy to win if your leon, piper, or gene, but a horrible trophy plummet if your just about anyone else, I would have personally went for King of the Hill not going to lie...
---
sad popcorn thicco and el rudo noises

They need to make a queen shelly skin
---
Wow!

That‚Äôs odd, he keeps leaving coach Cory comments on silence. Is there some beef that happened or something?
---
How you people draw this things so well ? It's seems so complicated
---
Lmao what's this
---
As a rework for band-aid, very meh. Band-aid seems to be perfectly fine now. Granted, it's a defensive heal that makes Shelly harder to kill. But again, it's a defensive star power.
---
Buuut, a healing ability that works when your character stands still is a neat concept overall. If there was specifically a tree or even a gargoyle character, that'd work perfectly.
---
They have the same gender

If you drop them they bounce back to your hand

sandy must be mythic because ~~she~~ he has.... rose clothes, like tara gene mortis(on his top hat and tshirt)
---
That‚Äôs not true at all. I said the exact opposite actually. You know now how this works with your case, if you want to get back into positive gems then it‚Äôs *on you* to prove to Apple that those refunds weren‚Äôt initiated by you, from your iTunes account on your Apple device.

You just gave the exact reason why this isn't in the game. Targeting specific players is a big no no
---
I love you Mr. Bat
---
Perfect example of Supercell giving a legendary to a kid at 300 trophies who did nothing to deserve it.
---
When will people realize it‚Äôs someone teaming with a weaker player and the matchmaking finds a game based on the highest trophy teammate
---
Genderbent hentai
---
Yes
---
Dude love your posts hope supercell adds these keep up the good work
---
Why do people do that? Why would someone want to lose trophies? And why would someone want to be the person everyone hates?
---
That Rico had 400 trophies that's why....
---
If anyone in the match has more than 400 u r able to see the replay
---
He doesnt have a King skin
---
Genderbent hentai lewd stuff
---
I really love your artworks
---
The Rico named Poco was at 403 trophies, so he/she has unlocked replays for this match. The replay is then available for everyone who was in the match
---
WOOOOOW
---
This isn't a fan art its a effect
---
I prefer game throwers rather than retarded randoms because it loses my hope at least
---
Just that brawler may be 100, but their overall trophies may be quite high. My 8-bit is low cause he is newer, whereas my other brawlers are all 550+
---
If one brawler in the round on 400 or higher everyone can replay
---
just watch them
---
bruh

oh i didnt even know!! thanks!

it's supposed to be soy sauce :b

thanks for the help :))

I used to think that people just exaggerated these kinds of things until I saw my friend with 4k trophies get 2 legendaries

Thanks broüòç

Same thing happened to me. I have 2 accounts, my main is 8k and my 2nd is 7k that time. I haven't played my 7k trophy account for like weeks or months because im busy and im focusing in main account. Then after logging in in my 2nd acc, after several boxes I've unlocked crow and im shookt LOL

is there any access to the island at 1 o clock except through supers?

It looks so because of the angle of the picture^^;;

this is much more fitting than having an entire scoreboard of all the players- i hope they do change it to be exactly like this because this is honestly perfect

Ya that's true but supercell wants everyone to be a gemmer

How about #32 frame...

So is Jessie but she got more guys shaking than Sandy does right now.

Thats amazing!!!

i colected 108 power points in friendly with mortis new mondial record ;) (funny)
---
That's pretty cool
---
reposted it cause it got deleted along with my old account
---
Wait im confused... Sandy is a boy?
---
THEN MORTIS CAN.

I guess this is under 400 trophies lol people are complete idiot

No I didn't get wrecked by Leon, I get cheap shotted by every cowardly little baby that thinks they have any talent. And unless you're out in the open with mortis instead of hiding in the grass and waiting to three shot someone when they pass you by and aren't prepared for it, then you aren't good with Mortis. There isn't any skill in doing what every single person has been able to do since day one.
---
Call me when you're surrounded by a Penny, a Jessie, and a Rico and they're all gunning for you because you're a Rosa and can't attack them. That's that cowardly bullshit that I'm talking about.
---
Im definitely never giving another cent to super cell unless they add a one on one duel mode with minimal cover and no grass to hide in. Either that or actually balance showdown between close range, mid range, long range, and throwers so that nobody can ever get into a showdown match with a character that they have no hope of beating because they can just keep running away and chipping at them.
---
550 trophies. He had around 520
---
Oh wait you meant the other one?
---
someone's cake day is always relevant
---
Same thing my friend you need to learn to place your shots especially when there are blockers in goal. You need to learn where their hit boxes are so you know whether you can squeeze the ball past them. This is important so you know whether or not you should walk the ball into goal or shoot it in
---
How is That even possible
---
Also shit posts at https://www.reddit.com/u/Totallynormalmale
---
not really impossible ?? its totally possible especially if its an op brawler
---
Chocolate is better :P
---
Thats cool
---
so cute
---
Sandy is oficially a boy
---
Probably because there are more than 2.29MILLION people playing the game and supercell hasn't spent the money they earned from brawl stars to upgrade their servers
---
Wdym this art is good....atleast he is not like other reposters.
---
hello im leon. im a good kid that kills people.

You can‚Äôt switch your view point. A second ago you said it wasn‚Äôt relevant and now you try to use it as an argument. You were probably 10 times worse than one half of them

Oh okay

Cool drawing
---
Try your best not to be the opposite you are now

Literally ran around my apartment yelling at 1am
---
Nah bro I‚Äôm just responding to you assuming my play ability with absolutely 0 evidence
---
I think the reload speed should be a little bit faster

This is stolen, don't trust him

It's not hard to fake these

Wanna report him for having too much skill?

Yaa another repost

bruh please dont call him the best character thats an extreme exaggeration unless u got proof dont say it

I got leon yesterday and I was only 600 trophies
---
Amazing.I love Cuphead style art!
---
Yea i quit a year ago. Was first place in my country. Came back to open my 600 boxes for leon. Didnt get him. I came back yesterday. Opened about 100 boxes. I got carl, rosa, Sandy, leon, gene, tick, 8 bit. Have everything nowüòÇ

My english us not enough, i will say in russian - Shedever, ok translate masterpiece??

yeap, i think the end screen should just be the same as a regular showdown, dont really need anything new there. imo

Look at spicy Mike. Its attached to his hair! OUCH!!!

Because you posted your 6969 trophies. You, sir, are indeed, dumb.
---
I m 11500 thropies but no legendaries
---
YO! A little help here?
---
I'm gonna come after you for having more legends and mythics than me. How you get those bro.
---
Kk
---
I don't have friends anyways
---
Probably frustrated about you randoms
---
If Bo had the star power there'd be an image under him showing it. SMH
---
It's not really worthy news tag. Also what trophies are you at and when did you start playing. As if you been since beta this is sort of normal.
---
I got it, stand Back son, one, one, one, one, uhh.. one
---
If the enemy team is Penny, Rico and Jessie then chances are its an open map. I dont see why youd play Rosa on a map designed for long range brawlers. Also long range brawlers counter rosa. Brawlers counter other brawlers, thats the point of the game. If your brawler is getting countered constantly by certain brawlers on a certain gamemode on a certain map then choose a different brawler. The enemy isnt gonna let you just attack them and let you win the game. Thats why people hide in bushes because its a strategy that helps you win. If theres a map where theres lots of bushes and leons then just play a brawler that counters him and dont go near the bushes. Simple. Dont get mad because you get killed and lose games. It happens.

I can understand that you want to kil the servers.
---
Is it?i dont know.im sorry if its reposted
---
Omg spike is so adorable and Leon is so üòé
---
then you dont know how to play
---
Damn this is a good idea. I would suggest that all Redditors may do the same, whether teammate or opponent, who troll, to upload their IDs to a Google spreadsheet or smtg. Not that it may do much harm to them, but worth a try.
---
The only downside is ppl may simply upload IDs after rage quitting, hopefully it does not happen tho.
---
Well luck I guess got spike 2 days ago.. and now Tara.. ^^ I had all legendaries and was missing only Tara. Now I miss  sandy
---
Dang I never even saw the one at 0.42 before
---
How is that even possible
---
The only problem is the duos are too close to each other BUT this is an amazing map
---
Noo xD 0.4% I remember it being 0.0x lol
---
Check your english
---
proof that you were a beta tester ?
---
Lol idk why supercell copied One of their Brawler idea &amp; make a another one. F For Leon.........
---
no
---
Your post has been removed, make sure to use the body of a post to elaborate on the title.
---
I spent more than 200 tickets but I only recorded that part
---
I have sandy but i think it is a trash
---
A report button should be implemented to get rid of these idiots
---
True
---
I'm at 11k and missing gene and 2 legendaries, spike and sandy!

what's wrong there?

Did you cash tell the truth.

i have sexual intentions with leon

What did you made with jessie, she's naked

Watch, he'll turn red any seconds now.
---
Anyyy seconds now...

See, red!

You can actually reach 7:30 if all maxed up
---
send the entire screenshot

exactly
---
You can say that about any comments, so that's  not a argument.

But he has less brawlers than you
---
# I SAID SHUT UP YOU ANNOYING SHIT!
---
How do you people come up with this?
---
Penny's head on El Primo's body
---
Meant 8 bit
---
Ok thx for explication
---
You shouldn‚Äôt be able to kill someone who doesn‚Äôt know you exist
---
I think it wouldn‚Äôt be the best idea because 
---
1. A lot of children play
---
2. People usually speak either English or Spanish, so it might get confusing for English-speaking people who don‚Äôt know Spanish as well as Spanish-speaking people who don‚Äôt know English and further disrupt gameplay
---
3. How would the mechanic work? Would it just be open-mic? Would there be a button you press? etc.
---
Sandy is like
---
Heil **tler

just dark humor nothing more im not a **zi supporter

He he
---
yeah but your the only one who says posting a screenshot of rank 35 is a shitpost
---
El Primo : I am the Boss of bosses!(crow noises)
---
Its normal and depressing
---
Yup
---
lmao who would want a account at 4k
---
No it's not an alt account plus I focused on all of the brawlers since I know someone with 16 brawlers at 6k no epics nor mythics neither legys
---
This is a repost bc M1s51n9n0 told me to crop this pic.

Piper doesn't have a British accent, she has an American southern one, and yeah I think she is part french because her name was Piper De La Prim or something amongst those lines.

I am 11k and i haven't any legendary brawler, i play with realize in android from canada!!!

I have 5K throphies and i have all rares, all super rares, and all mythics. But just one epic which is piper

How can good players, for Example the best german Tara (thats me), contact you for a little push? It would be an awesome experience!
---
Can I have the template
---
Might be hard if it‚Äôs a graveyard, y‚Äôknow
---
Do it
---
It fits the definition. Tell me how this post is useful to this sub. It's not. It's the same as posting that you got leon. Your just bragging,and  not helping anyone.
---
Friendly for robo rumble?
---
Why is this so true tho I‚Äôm at 9000 no legendary then my 3 friends at 1500 have legendary and say I‚Äôm trash becuase I don‚Äôt have. A legendary

Could be an okay meme without the nobody, it's useless and overpaid at this point.

Have you ever seen a western movie? They have plenty of pool tables in saloons and stuff. His original design had a poncho and cowboy hat, I don‚Äôt see how he ISNT based in the western era

Ok thanks for replying to me it feels like I've won something cause I never win in giveaways and im 10 so I can't get twitch so thank Kairos

I‚Äòm almost 10k and have only 1 mythical and no legendary

Yeah but they can rework him, not make him the most useless Brawler ever

Ur probably right. All i know is that he id a pool bot. That is confirmed.

I bet your noob ass can‚Äôt do that for shit lmao

r/shittierbrawlstars
---
When you thought that it is a shitpost about 69, but it is not and it is even worse
---
After you unlocked gene and proceeds to continue opening, i thought you are going to pull a leggy
---
As in, does the post introduce a new concept like a new game mode, ot shares a fact that is obsucre. Does the post at least make you chuckle. Things like that.
---
Is a good mode to prevent teaming. Why was it even removed
---
I'm at like ~2k. What do these memes mean? Am I at better odds for unlocks?
---
I don't have any legend and i am 13k almost 14k

Guys, take some sleep ok?

Yeah I was kinda bored at the time.

Sure.

I am 12k and nooo legendary

My drop rate is 0.12...

yup most easy to push brawlers !

I have morts and gene not yet

I have all but 3 lengendarys ._.

His shit is extremely strong tho, depends what you play, but just stay close to a teammate and spray
---
Happy birthday!  I got 100 coins for mine :/
---
If only that darryl were a jessie. Easy 13 minutes
---
I got my first legandary spike like 2 days ago im at 8k now you just have to save a bunch of boxes and when theres a new updatr open it dont just imediatly open your boxes

Also, no legendary brawlers yet at 9k, the road is paved with my sadness and sorrow.

Why did you turn me into a skin?

Anyone else 14k and no legendary? I've seen people at around 12k complain about having no legendary but no one at 14 k complain about it, so just wondering..
---
Why the fuck ppl are asking for Shelly nerf? Have u seen meta tierlists?! SHE'S AT THE BOTTOM! Yeah her recharge speed is too fast, but except that she's totally balanced so stfu if u don't know how to handle a Shelly it doesn't mean she needs a nerf
---
Rico is based of how people looked back in the 80's in the us

And Nita, Leon and Bo are all related

shelly got hit by a stun grenade

yep you just need a higher level leon and skill and trust me he doesn't suck he so strong on takedown i'm a leon main

no u
---
Then why don't speak french?
---
This shud be illegal
---
Saving boxes is my current tactic so far ive saved 40, also nice i hope you enjoy spike.
---
Tbh i like how rare they are you just have to wait and save boxes youre chances should jncrease if you have all brawlerd except leganderies and when you have some max brawlers
---
Yes. They did.
---
he is a little sleepy boy
---
I think you should make the destroy cover after yellow post bar charges one of the star powers. Apart from that really good idea for a brawler!
---
tf do u mean? its easier to push on sds lol

You have to pay for my aids treatment now

R√≥wnania is so dump, i'm 800 nita and have 24 in Poland

Okay i have barley at like 750 power points level 7 so ill do him
---
Yo im at 12k and i got my first legendary yesterday and it was sandy i was SO HAPPY

Jessie, Barley and Spike. Their 2 star powers are amazing, so maybe that should be your priority
---
Only English in this subreddit.

Okay

Bro relax it‚Äôs just a idea it‚Äôs not post stealing contest‚Ä¶ btw this post is made my Supercell only the colouring is add by someone else‚Ä¶ I found it good so I thought it‚Äôll be a great idea

You dont know how people from spain talk, they have a different accent and the voice actress for shelly is from colombia.

Leon and Nita are siblings.

Piper counters shelly hard usually

You should call him ‚ÄúBlaise‚Äù

No he dont have boobs, looks perfect with long hair, and how is the nose girly?
---
Uhh u talking to me or the guy who posted this?
---
You liar. I believed you for a moment.
---
You stole the art, and posted it as your idea. That is someone's else work, and you tried to use it for getting karma.
---
If it isn't yours, don't post it, specially when is something as simple that isn't a good idea
---
Sorry autocorrect my bad
---
Dam thats a high legandary chance
---
No matter how much reworked solo sd is gonna get teaming will not stop consider it as a strategy basically. An illegal strategy
---
1:to much spawns. 2: take any rolling/jumping brawler,wait until enemy team jump and roll to them spawn with no chance for them to damage you(sorry for mistakes,i am not eng)
---
Same here
---
But the point is to have the most damage done, if you have other people shooting it you have a smaller chance to win.
---
Its the best to collect power cubes in the beginning and then take out others and start damaging the boss
---
Dont understand the meme, the point is to be the only one damaging it so it makes sense to kill others
---

This is really not OG at all

They just kept piling up. Made most of them to play with people, and they help organise a family of clubs.
---
At below 650 trophies literally everyone is actually mentally disabled. It gets better above 700 tho
---
LEEEEEEORY JENKINSSSSSS!
---
He's quite good actually. Most people who think he's bad probably played a game of showdown with him at level 1. Not only does he get a power spike at level 8-10, his star powers are fantastic and he absolutely wrecks squishy brawlers.
---
P.s. I think I may have messed up the spacing, but whatever lol
---
How about you can be an object and the seeker will have infinity armo but if he / she shoots wrong it will decease it health
---
That is actually Hilter gET It rIGhT nEXt TiMe
---
BooHoo let me press F on the world smallest keyboard
---
they have lives to waste
---
Good
---
i see it
---
There was a draw too
---
800 down to 680 is 120 trophies unless my math is off.
---
r/shittybrawlstars
---
Depends on the shot, a lot of these ones are more unique and the chances dont present themselves too often so its not as many as you think.  
---
Only one I remember is the shot at 0.42 was the 3rd attempt.
---
I think it depends on the map and situation you have. If shelly can get close to carl or nita, she is going to destroy them but if she can't, they are going to make her get step back.
---
The fact that she looks like a 5 year old and has boobs is scaring me
---
Oh my god. I'm in your clan! You're a legend, man!
---
Actually it‚Äôs skateboard wheels
---
Delete shelly
---
Why'sy pp hard
---
This is why I play spike and try to kill all shellys, it saves everyone else the torture of being killed by them. Getting killed by a frank which takes some skill to use doesnt piss me off nearly as much as getting killed by a no skill shelly. KILL THEM ALL...
---
You're mean
---
So maybe that's why i never get 1st place in takedown...
---
Yea piper is a veteran
---
coiled snake
---
Don't make this statement. The brainless people on this sub will downvote you to hell
---
Delete brawlers
---
True, there is a lot of 3rd partying and kill stealing in lone star, but I can still get kills quite easily and I can get 1st a decent amount of times. Showdown usually has at least a few people bush camping, stealing your kill  and even 3rd partying so Idk why you like showdown so much
---
I recommend Grammarly. Nice edit by the way.
---
Delete stars
---
Best comment LOL
---
The rewards for seekers is way too little compared to hiders. Also, you should be able to kill seekers, but they have a health boost.
---
This map is not symmetrical, all 3v3 maps have to be symmetrical on either a horizontal or a diagonal, or else it is not 100% even. Also r/brawlmaps for map submissions. Make it symmetrical please.
---
I'm at 13.5k and now I have one goal, to max all brawlers before getting a legendary, I just maxed 3 recently
---
after playing since global release,12k trophies and zero legendaries......
---
True Story :(
---
Forreal, I can‚Äôt even win cause I main tick and people keep killing me instead of the boss so I can‚Äôt land one hit.
---
Nah
---
I think your right
---
Just don't forget the other shnit names like tfue/tofue,el pro,el crack, noobmaster69, and the russian name.

In the post it does include skins and gene and sandy aren‚Äôt specific enough to be necessarily Egyptian gene and sandy are 1 sandy is just dressed like an Arab at the time if anything most wore lose garnmets

Ah you mean the negative IQ players yeah they exist
---
Yep I'll just walk over the the team's wall. Oops I'm dead
---
Now I'm thinking of a genie banging a voodoo woman. Thanks

It has a problem, the seekers and hiders can be organized so that the seekers do not kill anyone (making the hiders get the maximum reward) And when the game is about to end the hiders let themselves be killed by the seekers
---
Please how do u do this
---
Could be 7.
---
Yeah:3
---
Yeah same thing with star points if they were‚Äônt a thing I might be in top 200 local right now
---
Thanks so much! I have a couple of other questions...

---

Oh
---
Pretty sure this stolen, it‚Äôs the older model and looking at your post history you reposted someone else‚Äôs work before so I‚Äôm sure your the type of person who would do it again
---
Jajaja
---
Was about to comment, repost, but if you originally made it then I'm fine with it.
---
I did it for fun when I was in the lead, I got a good 40 cubes from it too lol
---
Bibi is medium ranged and not a tank
---
Why
---
Morti not mortises
---
Soup can your nut
---
Well if another brawler has 35 power cubes and I have a chance to kill them I will ,because they‚Äôd do the most damage to bot and win .
---
I got him about a year ago at 800 trophies, and i got leon a few months ago. I‚Äôm not sure if it was luck or not, but i dont have any mythics and im missing crow and sandy
---
Thousand lakes + dune drift
---
Ja jestem polski te≈º! Witam!
---
I got sandy to 550 (yea i know it's low, but i didn't got the time to pushe him) and i just lost 2 games as sandy, cause the enemys on those 2 games had a sandy too and he played better than i did, just 15minutes ago i made 7 gg games and won all of them which got my sandy from 500 to 550, so i have to say till now i found it much harder to lose than to win, but we'll see how op he is on 700-800
---
Yeah I know but I don't know what i can add
---
What if he offered like a wish? I would
---
I love the idea but 3 tokens...come on...we need more
---
All the brawlers weren't even maxed.
---
Thanks! :)
---
El primo
---
So that is why i didn't know about the game mode :D
---
Yde stop fucking flexing, nobody fucking cares because we all know ur life revolves around this game
---
Certainly will
---
You literally just copied infection mode in PUBG-M
---
Yeah right
---
Thanks! I was thinking he would be an Epic Brawler, but if he were to be on the trophy road, he would be at 8000 because that is the next rank that comes after 8-bit's rank.
---
Lmao
---
No thats not how brawl stars works
---
I‚Äôm so thankful they added the do not disturb
---
Just got barley's second star power nothing else I thought it would be. A brawler
---
I have a friend whose legy chance is 0.5% and has no legendaries
---
The patch notes said that it was when morelly-bit fell below 100% the effects would happen
---
Shouldn't we make 10001 a trend like 6969
---
Exactly this. I don‚Äôt know if the thread starter was trying to be smart or something??
---
AW YES
---
Please excuse me but in takedown I farm like 15 powercubes either from killing people or just finding them, then I go and try to do as much damage to the boss. Is killing people for powercubes making me an asshole?
---
Not from roblox. The idea is prop hunt
---
Are pink and magenta robes manly?
---
In the German version of Brawl Stars, Sandy is female. You can proove that by looking at the role of Sandy. In Germany there is a male and a female word for "fighter". And for Sandy it's not the male version, "K√§mpfer", but it's the female version, "K√§mpferin".
---
So she is female...
---
Pls like my post so more people can see it.
---
Hmm, it is incorrect
---
Sandy sleeps all day
---
10k and missing 6 brawlers lol
---
I agree 100% my dude
---
Me too. My legendary odds are currently 0.0816, what about you?
---
I got Leon from a Brawl Box whilst in school and when my friend was playing. HMM,
---
soooooo should i flip it
---
Which Mortis star power is better, creepy harvest or coiled snake?
---
Too....Anime....
---
This is not supposed to be selfish but will u give me a brawler I haven‚Äôt gotten on in three months and I‚Äôve been maxing my boxes every day
---
Oh, THE BINDING OF ISAAC, YAHOO!
---
Do not understand this meme.... Like at all
---
Like first sorry for bad drawing anyone who know to draw can do this and post it but u need to tag me
---
SHIN: he is new epic brawler who attacks whit wind his super is having giant range and deal massive damage of 4000 but when he uses his super he stop in place like Frank
---
His first SP is named "light as wind" when all 3 attack bars are ready he become 20% faster
---
Second SP: Hard as rock,when his super is ready he gains a shield that reflect 18% of damage he takes his shield disapier when he uses his super          
---
Hope u like it!
---
Ajo dacht ich mir auch xd
---
Ok fine 3:
---
If you know how to counter and evade in time, Creepy harvest is good. Coiled snake is good too if you want to get a head start on your opponents.
---
Lmao like every shelly ever
---
nani?
---
(üåü\_üåü)
---
HuH?
---
SHIPPP
---
Lol same. Wish she shot fireballs.
---
if you see this post dislike it to upgrade your legendary drop rate by a FAT Chance
---
if i say like no-one will
---
Epic
---
Pam's Star powers are both good. But I'd see myself using Mama's more often.
---
If they would add this, i won't need anything else for the rest of my life
---
which it is
---
U don‚Äôt even take off the name of the original poster
---
Very cool concept but would definitely need balancing, seems OP
---
Bruh I don‚Äôt careeee an I don‚Äôt upvote comments that‚Äôs tells me too make a post or something so you can get people attentions
---
Who cares man u gotta like itüòéüòéüòéüòéüòé
---
It‚Äôs not a problem unless you‚Äôre trying to push a specific brawler and the current map isn‚Äôt good for them. As soon as I learned to look at the map that‚Äôs up first and pick a brawler second, the game‚Äôs been a lot more fun.
---
Kairos i needed to ask how much time will it take me to get a legendary brawler i have grinded a lot to 7k ttophies and have 0.08 percent chance to get it
---
Can u not
---
r/lootstars also congratulations
---
Furrie
---
Extra ticc
---
*confused sceaming*
---
it took me like 30 seconds to understand this.
---
She has a lot of health, as well as an INSANE long range
---
Disturbing
---
Geil dachte ich w√§r der einzige der es gesehen hat XD
---
oh my god you just murdered that dude
---
I can see this game mode make it to the game as the 3th game mode with no teaming.
---
Fsss in yde real life
---
ignore the robot we added him by mistake lmao xD
---
10/10
---
between 550-600 and up or so, not as much difference from before, really

Easy
---
You should be able to edit once it‚Äôs in your Library
---
Excuse me? Who is this lemmy you speak of he sounds like a great man
---
I have an idea of an animal brawler too, he's name is ROLF
---
He always wildin, it‚Äôs all fun and games til he shits on the floor
---
Its not funny, but hey you got 69 coins exactly, you dont see that everyday
---
Yeah. If you say that it's your "fiRsT pOsT" it's probably just a second account.
---
Ummm‚Ä¶ half the showdown maps cater to tanks/close range brawlers.
---
Good idea!
---
facts lmao
---
Yeah I suck:( only 9k trophies
---
I unlocked my second mythic today I'm at 15.6k
---
Yeah lol
---
I was playing with randoms so everything went wrong
---
Wow cool you survived from healing mushrooms. Such skill
---
Hola. Hablo Dios.

What is all that?

This was literally in a coach cory video a few weeks back, you fucking scum
---
*Kor from Brawlhalla intensifies*
---
frank hasn't a head its a mask
---
??? I dont understand you cant use you super until the bar runs out of juice??
---
Dw I'm sure you lick it up like a good big bro ‚ò∫
---
Alright calm down what goes through ur head don't speak like this on the internet
---
How is this possible?
---
I‚Äôm not the autistic one! I leave that to by other brother Maddox. He‚Äôs not autistic he‚Äôs just a fat weirdo
---
game files
---
Like Leon, your bar decreases to show the time left for the super
---
Omdz yeah
---
Wait why is Bull good for Heist?
---
Crop your meme
---
the new brawler is a sniper and has a giant bee as a pet?
---
Disgrace
---
I kinda like playing mortis but he is not so strong and dymamike is one of the three brawlers that I have rank 24(with darryl and colt) Does that make me a traitor?
---
blah da blalaha ma da???
---
r/itswhooooowith5os
---
Push a lot of brawlers to 550 trophies to start cranking out the star points and get the bog box and mega box for those star points at the end of the season. This should increase ur chance of getting more gold, star powers, and other brawlers üëç
---
Stop trying to get free karma, you really are the lowest type of scum in society
---
Aaarghhg beear
---
Nothing, buddy. You're pretty much stuck. I would suggest playing a lot and using the star points you obtain to buy mega boxes and big boxes, and maybe some skins if you like any. Hope I helped.
---
On wich can I access game files
---
Why do I hear megalovania?
---
The problem i have is that at higher trophy counts the level disparity is too high if your buddies are casual. My roommate caps out in the 200s on her highest brawler, and i outright can not play with her without using brawlers i just dont play and havent pushed yet. If i try, she gets smashed by people with a 3/4 level advantage and star powers, so matchups get stupid and she loses fights she shouldnt because the numbers are out of whack. Its 90% why i had enough trophies for tick when he launched but also still only have roughly 7k now, i just dont play because my friends cant play with me.
---
Hmm interesting
---
nah it comes more from the overused annoying jokes that the guys post more than the character itself, really
---
Im traumatized lmao
---
He's quite girthy but not that long so not really that great
---
From mortis gang?
---
r/no
---
hello i would like to ask you a question why you guys don't do a way to exchange gold for gems this would be so cool until andre approved it and he's from the brazilian super cell support i have a video on my channel will be leaving tomorrow or it should have left more here is the video link [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHgFCIUT9YQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHgFCIUT9YQ) is more pro final and I am Brazilian
---
No u
---
that is so cute
---
He stole that
---
This is SandPamPer !
---
Why do people like you exist?
---
BUT POCO DOESNT EVEN SPEAK SPANISH
---
but... they‚Äôre both beginning with ‚ÄòMama‚Äô...
---
That's why you can only do a couple brawlers each season. It helps the casual players get to those higher ranks atleast once.
---
Ayyyy hes arrived bois, it worked
---
Now this is epic.
---
Because it's a good song \_(¬∞^¬∞)_/
---
The don't attack me is just saying don't be rude.
---
i miss the old el primo, the new models just look silly
---
Thanks!
---
Honestly I've developed the mentality that if you fuck with me, I'm gonna fuck with you
---
Kairos in a nutshell
---
I found it on my sisters instagram and asked her if I could post it on reddit
---
I think he was open to criticism. They just didn't want people to be rude about it
---
I played it in Showdown and Bounty. 
---
Tick has incredible control in Bounty which is why he‚Äôs such a good choice. I pushed Tick in duos, Skull Creek and Cavern Churn. Since there are so many walls he‚Äôs able to attack most teams without them even hitting you. 
---
Showdown is a weird mode for me to say since most people think of Showdown as this mode that only cheaters use to organize team, however I just really enjoy playing it and it‚Äôs my favourite mode so why not.
---
r/buffmortis
---
Yeah. This is big brain time

Also don‚Äôt forget homosexuals

She has some weird fetishes
---
That's good that you at least have someone you have Brawlers low to play with. I have one or two friends that we have to sweat so we can play (all 500+)
---
Thiccest brawler
---
same 
---
my el rudo skin doesnt look special anymore
---
Yea :&gt;
---
¬øQue? What are you even saying bruv, that is completely wrong
---
I threw my phone and got a hole in my wall once
---
Terrible repost.
---
i'm 7k and have 22 i feel like i don't deserve this much
---
***well i ain't complaining ya know***
---
&gt;8-Bit should be American, because video games were invented in America
---
8-Bit is based on Gameboy and that is Japaneese invention. So he is CLEARLY japaneese. Also, not so sure about first ever video game to be made in US but i digress.
---
Mortis goes ‚Äúch√∂p ch√∂p‚Äù
---
love it
---
Or he couldve just had a lot of boxes saved up and opened them all to get the power points. Dont assume people are p2w when youre not sure.
---
That drawing is very cool!

Nobody said that
---
THƒ∞S ƒ∞S SO CUTEEEEEEEEREEEEEERR REEEEEE
---
I dont have friends to play with 24/7
---
The saddest part is this issue has not been acknowledge at all, and people stop complaining because they already got used to it.
---
Honestly, I want to give my account away for free, but terms and service says no
---
i won‚Äôt see but im sure that is a clickbait
---
Ok thank you, I was unsure when I saw the stats and was thinking to myself ‚Äúwow a great ability, attack, super, and damage, but wow that hp is weak for a melee brawler.‚Äù Thank you for telling me these are lvl 1 stats
---
lol
---
Why can I relate so much with this
---
his yt channel sucks
---
I feel u bro
---
Made me laugh!
---
Take my upvote!
---
Same except I bought boom box brock
---
Thanks! Any reason for those particular numbers of boxes you keep? Also any reason you keep many types of boxes instead of just all small boxes, since the boxes just have different numbers of random draws than different content?
---
Oh my thank you
---
I bought boom box brock too SMH
---
So.... This IS really getting spread everywhere
---
I once saw a mortis with 20 power ups that didn‚Äôt attacked the bosss and just killed everyone else, at the end he decided to attack but robot was so los in health he ended up in 7th place, that‚Äôs what he gets
---
Me playing piper and being upset when I end the game with 20 cubes but get 8th
---
Still a guy
---
Delete it
---
Duh, lmao. Why would I post NSFW on my channel?
---
Y si en ves de atacar al robot atacan a uno
---
There is, i saw with my own 2 eyes, now i want to die
---
Hey wait that's not all skins...
---
Ohhhhhh I just didn‚Äôt put a pic cuz I‚Äôm terrible at drawing
---
He was good during beta but now he‚Äôs just like any other click bait YouTuber
---
I don‚Äôt understand why someone would name themselves that- it‚Äôs not even funny
---
I am at 14k got spike when I was 5k got Leon when I was 11k no crow or sandy I think this is how all bs accounts should be
---
Or it could be sandy
---
The worst kind of youtubers, the fact they legit make a living out of this is so sad
---
Haha thanks! I actually spent all my tickets since the 8-bit combo is so OP. I‚Äôd advise for the next robo rumble bringing your Pam up; even a lvl7 Pam is good enough for max time when paired with a strong 8bit and star power (shocky) Jessie.
---
Hello im new ! My videos went viral so fast
---
don‚Äôt care about your channel lmao
---
Thank you good Redditor!
---
I'm embarrassed now I started during June and I have 12000k trophies.
---
No prob man
---
No problem
---
Okay! I‚Äôll try to level up my pam! Can u hit me up on brawl stars pls?
---
No it‚Äôs not is just do damage not kill other players :P
---
If you buy Sandy, then that offer disappears the next day. It isn‚Äôt replaced with an offer to buy the other legendaries at this time; you‚Äôll need to wait for the next legendary offer time from Supercell.
---
Thanks just thought if I bought her maybe crow or spike would appear appreciate it !!
---
Does the team share powercubes or?
---
Why did you put the Humor tag then? Aha!

I think you‚Äôve found our next brawler
---
\#WELL PLAYED
---
heehee hi doe ;)
---
Incredible job
---
That ruins the point of 'solo modes'
---
Its the cycle of life
---
YES! This is my favorite skin and brawler so I get hyped when I see these fan-arts. Extremely well made. I‚Äôm saving this!
---
Exactly, people just throw away the match because they have a Mortis/Tick on their team. Instead of giving them a chance
---
Ikr, I want it so bad
---
C O P Y R I G H T S T R I K E
---
But i didn't face such situation before uptade and to be true i mostly play with my teammates who have lower trophy as well but i never faced such a terrible matchmaking before the update and because of this problem i have already tilted more than 100 trophies but i managed to recover it by playing duos and events like takedown and lonestar.
---
When that one guy decides to ruin his own chances of winning by making your life a living hell. BIG BRAIN
---
The problem is most people don't use tick correctly.
---
you use tick...
---
press (Y) to Shame.
---
Lol mb have a good day sir üòÇ
---
She also has a heart pin on her leather jacket, or at least her artwork did
---
That would be, as the name implies, madness.
---
How is it possible to get that many trophies and not have all the brawlers? I'm at 5500 and I just need 2 legendaries and 3 mystics, (and 8 bit)
---
If in doubt:
---
Eheheheheheheheh
---
Really like the idea
---
Doctor: 10k damage piper can hurt you she doesn‚Äôt exist
---
him**
---
Why are people still calling him as a female---
---
well thats why solo exists
---
whyd you post this 4 times
---
But at one point everyone on one team will be too powerful for the other to even have a chance.
---
r/foundthemobileuser
---
Sorry
---
Well its nice but if u use it on an already existing offer.. Skins are gonna cost nothing, it also loses its value. Kinda
---
I know the dude missed like 2 shots the entire game
---
Piper is widowmaker confirmed
---
That's part of my frame! I feel honored!
---
He knows, he‚Äôs talking about how the commenter said all starter characters are brain dead, and colt is a starter character
---
https://youtu.be/xjHdJJxU2M0 10:00
---
He's trash
---
This is going to give me nightmares
---
Maybe stop playing bull in showdown, he‚Äôs not even that good in it at higher levels
---
This feels like an action movie, where everything, despite ridiculous odds, lines up perfectly. Except this was able to actually happen using skill.

I agree with you but still login to claim daily rewards
