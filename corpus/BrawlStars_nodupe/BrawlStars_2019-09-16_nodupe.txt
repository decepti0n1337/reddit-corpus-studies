So sand does more damage then a flying pickaxe ok that makes sense
---
Lmao I'm getting negative karma
---
Pam is fine, she just need a skin
---
No cause I got crow with that
---
Better then if I were to make one mine would be horrible
---
[removed]
---
Nah I critised his other skins. I'm not redoing the gene thing twice
---
Leon look the coolest.
---
Now, instead of knocking them back they just get a really hard slap to the face that hurts and the pain stays there for a while.

It's so fucking easy to get karma on this sub.
---
Just steal anyone's art and that's it.
---
Who let you into reddit?
---
Mine just came up from 0.08 to 0.096 so idk man... no legendaries + no tara
---
yeah, if/when it gets like that, everyone will quit and move to rush wars, like cr to bs
---
They're not since the first day
---
I haven‚Äôt been on Reddit in a while, is r/whoosh still an acceptable term?
---
Crow was holding the peacock miraculous and his name is croyura
---
The point of fan art concept skins is so that hopefully they can have it added into the game, idk why you think they ‚Äúcopied‚Äù or are upset about this. They took inspiration from your fan art and you are upset by this? I don‚Äôt think you are the type of person to deserve it into the game like this then.

---
And triangles, very realistic
---
9k isn‚Äôt even that much, don‚Äôt complain. There are people like me at 14k with no legendaries.
---
If you drew that I will definitely upvote but apparently not
---
I can get behind this sub.
---
Doesn't mean it's good content.

Actually in the 3D model the eyebrows are blonde

I'm at 12k and I'm missing 2 brawlers

#Better delete your post because if it stays there you will get a negative comment,and if you act with rage will just DECREASE your karma,acting like this will result in a punishment,because of the FIRST rule of this subreddit

Bro at 5k I had no mythic of legendary, 2 epics, and all of everything else(before 8-bit to shut tf up

How do I find it

But it isn't nearly as tall as slenderman

That‚Äôs an opinion, and I disagree.

The drop rates are a joke but Supercell is a busines, that's how they get üí∞ If leggies were easy to get, then  nobody would pay for them. You either spend on the  game or pay with your time and patience and it may take a while to get a legendary. You're already playing for free so yeah.

---
I‚Äôm at 10k (I‚Äôm not that high and I shouldn‚Äôt be complaining) but I don‚Äôt have Mortis, or any legendaries

Yeah, you drawed something? NICE WORK YOU SON OF A BITCH. DO YOU THINK ITS FKING NORMAL TO STEAL SOME HARD-WORKING PERSON'S WORK JUST TO GET SOME STUPID ORANGE ARROWS? NO. IT AIN'T WORTH IT.
---
Not even. It‚Äôs actually not in the heat interest of the team for Multiple people to be playing conservative. If one holds the gem the other two can play aggressive

Yeah but put it on one skin so it‚Äôs cheaper

At least you now understand

---
I cant believe he stole it but thats people in brawl stars post stolen stuff and act as it was Normal
---
Tara ditched a magical spirit for an undead musician... poor Mortis. Maybe he should turn himself into a demon. That might win Tara over.
---
Because if you have received all tokens etc, you're only left to receive coins. So we'd rather wait for a new brawler or new upgrades instead of opening boxes and ending up with just coins.

Stealing from an artist from Facebook obviously. Stealing from another social media platform and posting it here isn‚Äôt a repost but it‚Äôs still stealing

they have? well shit, i guess i'll take it down

did the meme wrong still good though
---
tbh i like the way he draws jessie‚Äôs hair

It would have been fine if he credited the orignal creator instead of claiming it as his own. Even if he isn't on reddit doesn't mean its not stealing. He could have credited his FB account.

Its my case, but its not because I turn mad. Every time im like, Its my last game... then we win so im like ok another one... until I lose and I finally put my phone down.
---
First (and probably only)! JK, not to faux pas by commenting on my own post, but not sure if I'm supposed to upvote myself since it did it on its own.  Also, volume is loud if you're at work, my bad.  Also, teaming up in Solo is bad m'kay.

I'm that teammate.

Yeah but another legendary makes your probabilities go higher

 Those are the mods

Oh gotcha. Thank you for the heads-up.

 ‚ÄúHey look what I draw‚Äù he didn‚Äôt draw he flat lied and you are ok with that?

Just report him he is just a huge pathetic bitch

Simple right

No ur wrong

I saw him crawl out from behind a rats ass
---
Chronopierce didnt make it, they just shared that it was stolen from someone on facebook
---
What the NSA agents sees all day
---
Which app you used?
---
They can and they should. Solo showdown ain‚Äôt about teams. And she can still do it with a blast like that but a blast like that shouldn‚Äôt be able to wipe out Bull or Rosa or El Primo. If they don‚Äôt nerf the damage at least let it take more shots to charge her super. I trophy push in solo and if it‚Äôs packed with Shelly‚Äôs I‚Äôm almost always losing trophies unless the long range players get her first. I‚Äôve made it to 2 brawlers many times holding anywhere from 8 to 12 power cubes against a Shelly with less than a handful and always seem to be blown away.

Stupid bot! This amazing art made by hin!
---
I remember back in the day when it was 100
---
Illegal
---
Yeah just becuase you reposted doesnt mean you are stealing
---
Sandy's utility should make him a legendary, just saying.
---
*Shaking noices*
---
Yes
---
Shadman will make it interesting
---
anyone else feel like sandy isn‚Äôt that unique or original and doesn‚Äôt feel like a legendary? he kinda just borrowed random abilities from other brawlers like poco and leon, nothing really special just for sandy, like the other leggies (invis (not unique to leon anymore i guess), exploding cactuses, poison effect)
---
Carl one please!
---
Uhmmmm... r/ihadastroke
---
Yes ik I forgot to delete that :P
---
When you have a her super it will get messy
---
Ok she doesn‚Äôt even have as much health as bull or el primo
---
Welcome to brawlstars
---
Thank you
---
The mods don't do shit on here so sadly we can't expect them to do anything
---
Carl is my main so I‚Äôm loving it. *McDonalds Theme song plays*
---
Yo that level 1 crow at 800 is badass. Also yeah top players in clubs do this shit it‚Äôs disgusting. Thanks to the shitty queue times at high throphies it is possible to land on the same match more easily.
---
This is not yours
---
no i think it‚Äôs more the fact that he doesn‚Äôt feel as unique as the legendaries, it just feels like recycled abilities from previous brawlers, like poco and leon, albeit the invis is AOE, but is invis nonetheless, an ability originally unique to leon
---
This is really good art! I hope it gets noticed!
---
Literally 3 of these people are the biggest teasers in the game
---
What
---
no rarity is a measure of uniqueness as well. colt is very straightforward whereas spike has very unique mechanics. you‚Äôll notice as u go up the rarities their abilities get more complex/special
---
Don't buy them
---
how, it‚Äôs literally impossible
---
Who all tired to do this after reading it?
---
Yesss
---
I think the challenges should be extremely hard only for good players and I think you should only be able to unlock the brawler around like 7000‚Äì8000 trophies and it's less rare to get higher rarity puzzle pieces how about that or maybe you can only get the one legendary that you really like and that's it I came up with this idea because my little brother has 10000 trophies and doesn't have, mortis, tara and crow
---
everyone gangsta until Mortis starts throwing dynamites
---
Yea because she doesn‚Äôt need it. Any tank that gets to close is done for. What I‚Äôm proposing is a nerf to either damage or the amount of shots needed to charge her super. She would still be op either way but it would at least give a tank a chance. If it loads that fast she can hit you twice but you never get hit twice because the first one is a finisher. I personally would rather the charge amount be nerfd because if you ain‚Äôt to close you might be able to run away with a 16th of your health but not if she gets her super back to back.
---
Yeah so does everyone

To be honest, that Brock really played well but his teammates, especially that Poco ruined the whole game. He shouldn't have spun but if the poco wouldn't be so bad they would have easily won at the end. Your luck tho

How about a replay

Be thankful that they even made a f2p  game for you asshole

Ok loser idc what you think but we both came up with this idea, but your meme died in new for some reason. I didn't stole it

there is a possibility that ally brawlers might be undetectable by the enemy IKE when inside the sandy‚Äôs sandstorm, thus an instant no bot push win

Looks sick dude keep up the good work:)

crow should be part of the retro theme, i thought?

A) Is this what r/BS has become?

B) He‚Äôs literally a robot.

Iam at 13k with no legendaries
---
Yep. 17k here. Half my brawlers max level. Not a single legendary.
---
That‚Äôs so true
---
Ok seeing hot i saw someone near in time to my post i hate this subreddit
---
stfu, i do that, i mean habhabblla (you didn't hear me say anything)
---
In the video the bosses health was insanely high so I'm guessing there's some kind of time cut off
---
Can I have the old Rico lol
---
He dropped trophies so he could have max time and max rewards
---
Ooh this is so cute :D
---
Oops. You can't drop below 30. Yeah you're right. That's p2w I guess.
---
Nothing..
---
Check out mine üòÇ

Haha, that‚Äôs funny. I‚Äôm sick on my cake day
---
Haha ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù I wonder why you don‚Äôt know.
---
can confirm
---
t r u e
---
It was probably a coincidence and i don‚Äôt really post so I don‚Äôt care about upvotes and stuff
---
Good art! This post would probably get 1k+ upvotes
---
8-bit *has* five letters. He has a hyphen in his name, which counts as a letter
---
Wow
---
Yeah, i don't wanna post here anymore
---
I WAS JUST ABOUT TO DRIVING SAY THAT
---
Is 8 a letter?
---
I mean people copy stuff all the time in all different subreddits
---
I WAS JUST ABOUT TO FRINKING SAY THAT
---
You‚Äôre welcome.
---
I don't forget...CHANGE BO ICONN
---
The arcade bois were too slow
---
People being impatient and asking for the update instantly when we had a big update 2 weeks after another update.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt count that as a letter though...
---
*thinking*
---
That's so good and funny, makes me smile. Thank you.
---
Yeah but in the r/brawlstars there are kids, someone got 4k for stealing bruh, this is a thing that happens only here
---
i will miss him but i love the new remodel
---
Sick animations I see! Love it!
---
Thanks!

Wait... hmm... this makes me confused af
---
No problem! Your artwork is great. Would love to see more from you. üëç
---
Thank you!
---
O ye Aztecs or the Mayans
---
yep they will come with the update
---
$20 for leon
---
$50 gift card for spike
---
$50 birthday money for crow
---
The 2 $50 ones were back in the old days where deals were crap
---
No, but after this post blew up I might have too. I've been saving my points for when I get crow to buy his mechanic skin tho.
---
Frick ur gf rn
---
Shelly and Colt are better off.

Delivery sevice

Why are there no Colt anc Shelly shippers here?

I agree  but i disagree that rosa is they're mom

I feel like that every update

yea later ima clean it up

waiting... waiting... waiting...

Your a sick clay-maker

This art is good enough but calm down it was announced yesterday

He said he'll buy the new legendary brawler next time it comes out which is really sad :' (
---
Every time kairos opens a box and don't get Sandy he gets a bit sandy
---
Let's suppose it's SanD, okay?
---
Guys i‚Äôm shak-

Why is it so satisfying to watch

sleeping while running is sandy's best ability

Band-aid?

I know, but most people understand Native American as the natives of the land of today's United States. In the rest of the continent they're just known simply as 'natives' or 'indigenous people '.

Disgusting in my opinion

You dare oppose me mortal
---
F... He will always be remembered
---
Too secure safe. Only throwers good here

How the fuck, got all brawlers on 2 different accounts, one at 18k(highest 21), other one 12k.
---
Did you buy em all
---
#F
---
It's possible you get üèÜfor place 2&amp;3 in lower score for place 4 too.
---
Thats was lucky u just autoaimed
---
I agree, this does seem possible.

That‚Äôs why he‚Äôs always tired. He was using all his energy raging at randoms

You have a bit too much time on your hands..
---
Fuck opinions, right?
---
I‚Äôm in this picture and I don‚Äôt like it (10k)
---
Have you ever had sand in your eyes? Id rather get hit by a shovel.
---
No? Missing teeth, Pinochio nose...
---
This Is **AWESOME!**
---
Why retarded brawl stars devs give piper reloading speed with snappy sniping? Piper is sniper, not designed for shooting many shots. And it's breaking the game.
---
And shitty organized matchmaking and balance.
---
Braindead Frank and brawl stars devs, please do something... AS A FUCKING GAME LEAD.
---
You got me there
---
It was the first box I opened today (and nearly dropped my phone). I don't like hoarding boxes and I open them asap, so I'm leaving getting Sandy up to the blind luck. 3/3 legendaries, worked well for me so far :P
---
From we're

I thought that was a Glory Hole at first.
---
But the way we make it can improve it.
---
Yeah I was surprised at the amount of wins as well, maybe bush camping solo showdown until rank 2-3 so it doesn‚Äôt appear as a win? I played him in 3v3 brawl ball and he wasn‚Äôt too great which was why I was floored when I saw his profile.
---
I'm about tho whip zis ass boah.
---
All because people are assholes
---
100% Stolen, water mark is badly edited from left top corner. Original is done by u/VikingSkirts

At future i gonna do more balanced maps :)

But 8 bit?

it's people looking for a new brawler except of pam

Lmao, the ball flew

It happened to me!!!

Shelly is Puerto Rican

sorry for quality but that's what I managed to do

How u got this Nigth Mecha Crow skin Offer im waiting for a long bcz i haven't any Legendary at 15k ü§í

I hope this repost gets flooded with downvotes

SaNd?

omg 1.2 chance

Sandy is a Boy right, But looks Like A Girl
---
And icon of tara
---
I thought shelly was Spanish
---
Same thing here
---
Hey I updated the game nothing has downloaded what the freak
---
Collecting gems doesn‚Äôt make you the beat player, it will keep players from passing and instead steal goals. Kills depend on your role. There will be no team play in bounty
---
But won‚Äôt people get Avery if they don‚Äôt release update times
---
Nope its not. I just edited out the brawlers without the trophy count. [Voil√°](https://imgur.com/a/ku0CRk2)

Stop stealing memes.

Then he/ she should eat shit as well

I think it's lag (see the first five sec it suddenly flashes to the game modes
---
It's photoshop, no hate but it's humor...i think everyone should understand the joke. Let's be real, you can't get 2 brawlers in one box...or maybe it's something new and i haven't heard of it?
---
ye:
---
Idk I think it's just something to do with the update
---
Hah even Poco is confused on why he is in a dress but nice art
---
You right
---
Tara looks done with all of their bs
---
ok
---
You don't want to know how much i spend in caffeine...
---
Then you should subcribe to Brawl Stars youtube to know about new Brawl Talk
---
IDK about i think sandy is a female name and it looks like a girl so... \(¬∞√ó¬∞)/
---
Imagine 3 sandies in 1 team
---
Hah,my language absolutely different and difficult,idiot.But what about your father?I think he speak on english.Im 9 year old?Ok.But you 6 year old stupid kid.
---
it's literally written in your own post. Wtf is this.
---
Yup You are Right
---
Ik, like is there anyone willing to put money just for a brawler?
---
Wow, i liked this format with Spike!
---
It was meant to be a joke anyways so yeah
---
It's like whenever someone drops to like 2hp, they become OP and dodge EVERYTHING
---
This is sooo cute my heart is melting
---
true
---
 Nice, I will use it for wallaper thx!
---
finally. i literally have 130 tockets saved just because of casual play because the other gamemodes dont reward you as much
---
stolen and he got 2 silver awards and 1 platinum award.....
---
it's fine doe
---
Haha you're forgetting my Leon unboxing video üòÖüò≠ I'm still sad about that...
---
What is this? I mean its a nice drwing but the idea? Oof
---
Why the heck you are saying like this why ??!!!!
---
I dont know why supercell just uploads the Brawl Talk the day before or on the day of when the update comes out, its not that hard
---
I can speak 4 languages and you? 1 and a half? Who is the 6 year old now huh?
---
The truth!
---
yoo r u the real? hate it what mr.thief did
---
flair checks out
---
poco goes locoooo
---
Say any one üòê
---
There are no poison clouds in that gamemode so you are way less likely to get cornered by teamers and you can run away. And it's not that grate since you both have to get the kills in order to get points.
---
Hoping so
---
Ok.... üòê
---
It would be no fun to explain it
---
I know, its bad.
---
It‚Äôs all coarse, and rough, and irritating; and it gets everywhere.
---
Omg this sounds TERRIBLE!!! Knowing my luck on these videos, it would probably kill me üòÇ
---
Who the frick gave this art thief a platinum
---
Nice
---
nice high five
---
Then you are going to eat sand? (I'm joking)
---
Mortis have 840 no 820
---
What you mean I will get or not
---
holy shit...
---
I gave him my silver dang it
---
Yes,but only with the homerun bar active(sorry if my english is wrong)
---
It didn't need improvement. The famines weren't as bad as people said, they dealt with major war stress from the US, did some trades that should've sabotaged them but didn't &amp; many other things.
---
And now it has a platinum award because someone is stupid
---
that wad not needed, but it was executed perfectly.
---
I also gave him a silver right before I knew it was stolen
---
finally it's back after i wasted 50 tickets on big game
---
I dont know
---
My bad. I gave him one before I knew that the original artist is not the one who posted.
---
I can telekinesis
---
Because you can't hear her voice wich makes you think she's adult and not a screaming kid

You can see all the new icons in Coach Corys Video

Sanddest video #3
---
I would just have it always appear disregarding the area like most team shooters tend to be maybe just the bar no percentage
---
They wouldn‚Äôt officially announce it if they aren‚Äôt. It only takes a few days (usually) to get approval, meaning brawl talks are released around, probably just after, when they ask for approval.
---
r/thiccochet
---
*You know,  there was a reason supercell made the last two brawlers free*
---
Still 1% or 1/100 , still they don‚Äôt say to you if you open 100 boxes you will get a new one, the chance is 1% and u aren‚Äôt lucky
---
You can just say sandy fan art üñºüòë

Yeah, that Crow almost took my yin and yang out of balance :D

Stop bullshiting, it's official, it was even shown in brawl talk and youtubers are showing it.

I appreciate that you appreciate the appreciation of the appreciation

Looking at colt even 10 is good but doesn‚Äôt stack or else you‚Äôd have a primo running like a banshee

Seeing old maps about to be added 
---
It‚Äôs all coming together

I don't have maintenance.... WHY ?

The health on Sandy looks overtuned imo
---
Haha she better not find this, oh and did Sandy being a boy mess up your brain? Cuz when I think of Sandy Sandy from SpongeBob times in mind. It makes me lose braincells.
---
Smooth moves
---
Same for Primo I can say
---
Stop spamming
---
Well, you are right it was my favorite map
---
Got him to 500 b4 the update

You don‚Äôt get anything from most boxes

He  changed his clothes!

Its fine doe

Hate to say it cause it seems that people love his voice but i cant fucking stand Carl with his lisp, i just turn the sound off when im playing him cause of this
---
He  changed his clothes......

It's going to cost 80 gems... :) (confirmed by Coach Cory)

Wtf? Leon has great damage up close, his super is a very strong 1 that lets him either get away or powerfully ambush players, his long range damage is not great but he can poke at least, overall, not weak man.

Never had a virus on my Galaxy S4, S5, S6 edge, S7, S8+, Note 8, S9+, Note 9, S10+, or my current Note 10+. No clue where you get this virus information from. Apples got you guys real good with the brainwash.
---
Yes I am constantly having the problem where i try to do my super and it just does a normal shot
---
Well well well... who's in the wrong here?
---
I spend all my tickets on Big Game to get some gems on boxes, but only got to 47 gems.
---
I have 10100 and I have Spike only :"(
---
Why did you made it with mematic?
---
When you realize that everybody will call it sand anyways
---
What if Sandy was actually supposed to be tara's boyfriend instead of her son
---
Kill me
---
4,000 / 6,000 is not a lot these days.
---
I still think they release OP brawlers on purpose, it is just hard to balance stuff with such a limited number of people testing.
---
Once everyone gets a chance to play, it becomes more apparent what aspects need to be buffed / nerfed.
---
It is still an interesting theory, tho.
---
Now its too late :(  Happy cake day!

HE CLOSED THE MOUTH

Yeah but there isnt an auto shoot button that targets teammates

My man t-posing and being a choppa at the same time

What if this get 1 upvote
---
They just need to make it so you cant aim there or go inside the goal, that easy
---
My internet didn't work so I posted it a few times mb
---
You should see full gameplay first I think it‚Äôs premature to make nerf ideas for sandy yet.
---
Even if so, people will be tempted to spend more money on the game to max the brawlers out before a nerf

Also they aren't really innovative.

they put all those maps in solo bounty to counter teaming in them- change my mind

That‚Äôs actually pretty smart. No one else has pointed that out yet. It‚Äôs happened so many times that it does make me a little suspicious...

first of all, you don't need fuckin cracked apps. iOS isn't shit, it's way better than android. And the phones are overpriced because they have quality
---
Well, i saw a video of Lex using Sandy's super to sneak to the I.K.E, kill it and win in siege. Possibly Sandy's super will be changed, b≈´t i don't know.

Little did people know, Sandy was an available brawler when Leon came out, but you had to activate his super while he was already invisible

Maybe add a 5 sec cooldown.

Oh boy he g r o o v i n!

Its not gonna get  removed, probably replaced. Because what would really happen if you remove a star power that people already have? Not to mention how hard it is to get star powers

Sandy's projectile goes faster and in a slight arc in comparison to poco which has more spread and range. Also supers are completely different why did you also mention the super?

Wait before pressing post multiple times

Very unlikely because we have many cosmetics in this update. They would've told is by now. Btw. Lex did an Sandy vs every Brawler video. Pam wasn't remodeled there but Primo was

Why wouldn't I? If I could push Piper and Mortis to 700+ of course I would be able to push the other brawlers since Mortis and Piper are one of the highest skill cap brawlers. Not much of an achievement since people are getting rank 35 brawlers but that's what I could do with only 3 hours max per day.

Good idea but it‚Äôs hard to tell who scored on per pose and who scored on accident my idea just add a freaking report button with the ability to link a replay to it even if your not at 400 plus trophies with the brawler

No people must experience the pain frank felt

It would definitely be op because it would make the whole team not only sandy invisible for 12 freakin seconds. The range of the sandstorm is 12 tiles which is too big. I am expecting for his super to be nerfed like reduced the range from 12 to 10 or reduce the time from 12 to 10 or 8 because 12 seconds is too long for invisibility

Awsome memes incoming
---
should be 24h so these clowns dont get to it too often. if you accidentally do score by accident its still adequate to give you a penalty.
---
alternatively they could scan for people to whom that happen too often as a pattern and take away a brawler at a certain treshold.
---
Honestly if there were emotes in BS I could see people just trolling and emoting in the sand while invisible

Wouldn‚Äôt I have to pay 1k if I got it in a box instead? I‚Äôm new to star powers and no idea yet how they work.

Do I not have to pay for anything after the power 9 upgrade?

Your right. This idea needs to be reworked in some way.

---
it's hard to explain because i don't speak english, but I just put sandy here because he seems to be from the same family of tara and gene
---
No the last upgrade you pay for is to get to lvl 9 after that you dont pay to level up unless u buy a star power from a shop. If u get it from a box its free and the shop is only 2k

Nope

wow! c u in hot!

In your view, is 2k worth it if I have only 2.5k coins but my other brawlers of interest currently 400 or so power point away from level 9?
