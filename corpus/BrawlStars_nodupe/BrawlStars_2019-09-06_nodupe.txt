Thanks for pointing this out!

Yup this has happened to as well. Created a club with my co workers when this game first came out o n global. Always had a maxed out club and I promoted someone who was active and vocal in the clan to VP. Kicked everyone next week.

It indeed is a sensible idea and it does looks like it you have put some serious efforts on it and it is gonna make anyone sad to see their post get downvotes and thats obvious. But it might be that the people who downvoted thought a little bit more critically? Like the idle disconnect thingy when you don't move for few moment? Or that the star power isn't going to make any sense in any mode other than showdown or perhaps a little bit? But you get the point, I hope. Although I do agree with you that the downvoters could work it out in the comment section but again, the downvote option is their for a reason. Please don't think that I am just hating or being jealous its not like that at all its just that I have OCD and I can't stand anything that doesn't perfectly fit or make sense
---
Imagine having the time to do that. I don't have time to pull shit like that let alone play the actual game.
---
you are below 6k and missing 5 brawlers!! stop complaining about this, there are worse
---
This is the worst map I ever seen         sorry

#I do too.
---
I might be shaking again...

How the heck did you find the time to go start a screen capture?

I always want to do this when I get on Brawl TV but have never been able to :)

Also, RIP- sorry!

That's a great idea.

why u make her so hot. OmO OwO

Matching does suck, posts about it r fine.  Post complaining about complaints is just hypocritical.

It‚Äôs good

But it doesn‚Äôt feel like a Jessie that would be in Brawl Stars
---
Oh lol who is he
---
Yeah lol
---
Thanks haha
---
She too hot
---
This means if spike dies the enemy takes about 200 damage.....
---
Needs to be a higher return percentage like 15%ish
---
Only mortis would say this as he has the same sharp tip.
---
Ikr..very unexpected

How about anyone touched by Spike starts bleeding for 3 minutes losing 1000 each second.

It is just a generic nickname for mexican wrestlers. Also, Primo means first in italian
---
I have not been confirmed about the fact that they‚Äôre siblings because most fan arts about nita and leon is about a ship between them so thats why I didn‚Äôt know thx for letting me know anyways :D

wrong game for this subreddit mate

The piper icon we have now looks like a man

Thats... Literally El Primo translated to English. It is just a Spanish name for a mexican wrestler.

I have Leon and Crow (without money) and my friend got Spike from his 10k mega box. Gems are freaking common to get. And, while matchmaking sometimes sucks, you can just invite other people. Makes me want to tell these people to shut up even more.

i agree

Piper looks like a crackwhore atm

Now they are immune to lag

Alright so if it was like that then you could get matched with someone who just got tara at power level one. And before you say it can be both ways then matchmaking would be longer because you would have to be matched up with people around your brawlers trophies and you overall trophies
---
LMAO

WHAT?!? No way I created it with the piper icon atm :((

Guys I'll Answer to your all questions in next post. And its just a concept.

Bull new starpower idea belike: if Bull doesn't move for 5s he become a bush.
---
THE THING IS YOU DIDN'T USE SNAPPY SNIPING
---
No, that's an opinion. Would you like me to explain the difference? And
---
1. Why would they be for Mortis? Are you just some Mortis main who just wants everything in the game to either be an indirect or direct buff to him?
---
2. Band-Aid is OP but Shelly was probably the worst brawler in the game before it, it helped balance things out (a bit too much). What's the point of giving 2 OP star powers to Mortis for no reason?
---
3. I'm scared that this post has upvotes.
---
Oh it looks really nice! Give him a resting bitch face to match with bandita shelly!

Wait i got matched with him recently, is the world so small?

Mortis is one of my first brawler at lvl 10 and since Coiled Snake was released I found every star power of every brawler that I had at power 9 or 10 beside coiled snake

My favorite comment by far
---
so it should be fixed, it takes WAAAAAAY  too long
---
There are enough players to fix matchmaking. I am ok to wait 7-8 sec instead of 1-2 and play a good BALANCED match
---
Then why do most of your posts reach hot?
---
Piper showing her true colors at last.
---
Yes
---
Honestly pretty underpowered, even if you get killed it only deals 166 to the opponent. Yeah, it resets the healing timer, but it‚Äôs going to have reset recently if they just fired.
---
Honestly 50% would be more fair - kill a Spike, they‚Äôve secured 1660 damage on you in tradeoff. Severely damage one and he gets away, you‚Äôre left with some significant extra damage. In one-on-one scenarios, though, it‚Äôs still pretty weak.
---
Something to keep in mind, though, is that this wouldn‚Äôt make sense for a lot of the brawlers. Why would rough skin damage Rico from eight tiles away? Colt? Any other ranged brawler? For that matter why would it affect close-range brawlers other than Primo? Several of them have a weapon that prevents physical contact, and Rosa has plant gloves.
---
A fun concept, but would need some serious tweaking and would never make sense. I know, this is a game about robots fighting people with guns, lasers, magic, and fists, but even so it seems odd to attribute an effect to rough skin when that rough skin isn‚Äôt even coming in contact with anyone.
---
I‚Äôm probably just overthinking this.

Why are you trying to team?
---
Kids can't understand voicelines sometimes.

You were probably teaming as well. Why aren't they hitting you? its almost like they were surprised.

"As good as me". You find good teammates if you stop sucking your own dick. SMH

Your bad
---
Technically he is shooting the wall but it's not because the gun sticks out further. The tip of the gun is not further than the brawler circle. The path of projectiles starts exactly where it is shown when you aim which is slightly inside the brawler circle. 
---
What is happening is more complicated. The brawlers that experience this are brawlers whose shots do not pierce, explode, or shoot a volley (the shotgunners). For these brawlers, when you shoot at a box or brawler, you always hit the edge of the circle. This is called the hit box. If you shoot while standing on top of a brawler or box, you will hit the closest edge of the hit box relative to the start of the projectile source (start of the aimer). 
---
In this example, the brawler is positioned directly on top of the box and the box is positioned directly against a wall. When you shoot in the direction of the wall, the projectiles go into the wall because the edge of both objects are touching. You are hitting the edge of the wall first. If you stay in the same spot and shoot away from the wall, every projectile will hit the box. If you back away from the wall enough so the start of your aimer is more than halfway from the box edge that touches the wall, every projectile will hit the box. If you are less than halfway, every projectile will hit the wall. 
---
In my opinion, this is a bug and I think the wall edge should not just absorb the shots. While you can say that it's not a big deal for boxes, this also applies to brawlers. Swap the box for a brawler and you will miss all your shots if you shoot into the wall. While definitely rare, it would be frustrating to happen in a competitive setting.

I think the same. But i also noticed that if you upgraded a brawler recently the chances of getting his star power is really high from mega/big boxes. I opened one of each box at got both tara star power(1 from mega &amp; other from big box) which i upgraded 1 day before opening those boxes , i  still didn't get any star power of Shelly, penny &amp; dynamike.

Figure out her Attack delay and her spacing. She‚Äôs like Bull in the sense you need to get up close to the enemy to be effective, but she‚Äôs not much good hiding in bushes. She‚Äôs best used to push people back and control space
---
When you get the hang of it work on moments to knock opponents away (eg so your teammates can score a goal or knock them into your teammate‚Äôs Super) and when NOT to knock them away (eg knock them out of your teammate ‚Äòs super)
---
Familiarise yourself with map areas where you can ricochet your Super to maximise damage in close quarters or even sneak attack enemies out of sight (e.g. IKE that is on 1%)

Play with your friends or be lucky

I keep facing so many top players from all servers it's not even funny just yesterday I faced Elliot, Bobby, Alec ,yamada,Uday etc and almost all pros from my country while I'm a f2p player at 19k playing with randoms and lesser know players most of the time it's rough man.

Server capacity can definitely play a roll but why does it trigger the Wi-Fi symbol....?

Are you sure you did it, because there is some websites that can make picture into pixel art for minecraft, I have nothing against that, but it still not fair getting upvotes when you didn't even do that (I'm not saying you did, just asking)

I am not that good at mort,i just pushed him in bounty for 20k.Anyway if u want some mort tips is to wait for the enemies to clump up then you can mass kill.I only use mort here coz of many long range brawlers which makes it ez for me.For pro mort tips watch Yde on YT lol
---
u win

Yeah it's the first ever golden mecha bo actually

Yessss!

sure ya

is this post a troll ?
---
Or grab El Primo
---
Omg penny 
---
Lmao
---
I like it, and that's snow joke
---
I didn‚Äôt think about that, but yeah, this would be a HARD counter to Crow. The best Crow players damage their opponents, and then heal while the poison is still in effect in order to compensate for Crow‚Äôs low health. But if Crow also takes damage when he hits SP Spike, that strategy is gone.
---
I dont have much except targeting long range brawlers and throwers,and waiting for enemies to clump up then attack.For pro tips you should watch Yde on youtube xD
---
?
---
Legendaries represent how unique the brawlers are, not how many skins they have
---
Can I just say all of their expressions are just priceless?

It's quite possibly the most "what?" Thing I've seen ^ _^

Your at 3000 I had like 22 brawlers at 3000 and now at 14k all I need is leon

Yeah, I‚Äôve watched some yde. He‚Äôs good too. Thanks for the tips!

atleast piper didnt look like a grandma

True. Randoms now get high trophies because they can play with players ridiculously higher than them and get carried all the way.

What if they add a on/off button on the settings to change the idle disconnect?

And 8 yr old kid complains about the smallest things right? üëç

And no, short terms are typically used by the teens to mid life people. So you're either too old or too young. Or u just got a stick up ur ass.
---
yes
---
They put skins with discount every other day. Why making a post about it ? Did I miss sth ?
---
That's like the old first star power from Feb 2018 or something like that
---
What‚Äôs with these people saying it‚Äôs OP? This means that Poco has to die to use it, and the optimal play is to stay alive...
---
because the clips are mine, why I should give them to you???
---
Yeah I was thinking what would be a good star power for poco and then I remembered his old super lol.
---
Very impressive how‚Äôd you do it?
---
The meme died but i love Primo soo take my up vote lad ;&gt;
---
No the graveyard is his and hes mad cuz Supercell made it into a battlefield like barleys bar and bulls diner
---
Are you from Czech Republic?
---
Stolen from u/ChronoPierce
---
This is what I was thinking as well. I made it heal 3000 because he has to die to use it and also has to wait 20 seconds.
---
Star Tokens are awarded when you get 4th place or higher in Showdown.
---
Actually there is a 36% of chance of not getting a star power on 100 boxes. And a 13% of not getting a star power on 200 boxes.
---
Counting that you have on average 5.3 boxes/day (assuming you do everything right). There is a 13% chance that you don't have any star power in 38 days.
---
This man is milking this comic so much lol
---
When someone asks to team me - my goal is to backstab. One of them wanted to so I went to kill him and notice the rest of the dynos. At that time I had to wait for the best moment.

When the ‚Äúnew mythic brawler‚Äù down the bottom is cheaper than the limited time discount
---
Who else clicked faster than sonic
---
For the first aspect of the game, the people are not bots. You will come to know of them as "teamers" and either hate or become one of them. If you see two players start spinning, run away from them. Spinning is a form of offering truce to another player. Although many players are against it, Supercell says that it is a "legit" survival strategy and it will not do anything about it so if you lose to teamers just know it's supercells fault. Sometimes you may just be unlucky and find yourself stuck between 2 players who want to gang up on you first before attempting to kill one another.

You must be very childish if you got mad  cuz they accepted us.

I mean second time

Cool idea, but there should be more room for brawler interaction, so some of the walls should be removed. Also, add more aesthetics and bushes
---
welp...dont get how brawl stars is involved here oof
---
mini?
---
It‚Äôs an issue people have with Clash, and I‚Äôm sure its an issue for people here. If I thought the world revolved around me, I woudnt have said that the issue is unfixable. I know Colt and El Primo aren‚Äôt overpowered
---
Honestly though
---
Mod...
---
So since someone already did something you can't do that? For the same reason he shouldn't even do Brawl stars video since other people already did that. If I want to make something that I like why I can't?
---
I can‚Äôt believe some people have no life so they fucking try to ruin other people‚Äôs accounts. Also, the hacker isn‚Äôt very smart, because they were dropping trophies AND trying to sell the account? So sorry man, that hacker is such a horrible person

Mod....

sadüòÇ
---
Daryl was known by noobs to be the worst. In no way was he bad. And he still isnt.
---
He got the nerf from 40% to 30% that's balanced in it's own right. And daryl got a buff to his base which wasnt need. So be happy instead of complaining.
---
Now its 30% to 25% still balanced because he got a buff to his attack. Now if he lands all 3 hits he can deal 9.4k dmg enough to take our frank with his second star power and if he has rolling reload (which is deemed useless by noobs) he can deal 18.8k dmg.
---
So call darryl weak all u want dumbass but thats definitely not the case.
---
Dude... Where did you get that comb

Isnt there someone that can duo with me and show me a few mortis tactics?

Try solo but don't pick a thrower and I assure you the map will be infested by teaming mikes, ticks and barleys(this doesn't applies if you pick mortis).
---
Ok, but it would be cool if they added a darryl voice...people are saying he doesnt have a mouth but then look at rico and tara...they also dont have a mouth, but still can talk...
---
ew ew ew ew EW!!!
---
dont wanna go back
---
Bruh i need to make tick and 8 bit to 20
---
Yrah me too,but i miss 5 brawlers that that will be 2 mythics and 3 legendary..
---
2 is better
---
Nice man üëåüëåüëå
---
Ya that's good I
---
Tick is a actually very good in Cavern Churn cus you can spam middle and your super if you throw it in the bushes you can kinda see where someone is
---
Mike the spike is right water isn't wet the item it is on is wet lol I love how we can all just be smart butts and yet all get along with eachother.
---
I hear what you are saying though as the partner I was speaking with on the phone experiencing these issues with also has 1 Gig internet speeds. I myself have 300 Meg both more than capable. I also use a Galaxy Pixel 3 XL. There is pretty much no reason for this on either of our sides. Thus going right back to Supercell.
---
How are ya‚Äôll typin so fast?
---
Hahaha Jaja! Mike the Spike your Right!
---
ORIGINAL [SAUCE](https://youtu.be/70qgGh-jPaw)
---
Well they get killed by the storm or win the match
---
They might be op but yeah cool new star power ideas, even Kairos likes them
---
Mortis can hide in those tombstones. When he stands near them, he disappears. Or maybe thats too unfair
---
By the way, I am not a pro at this game but I think that I am an above average player. I am assuming you play with randoms.
---
In showdown don't be the first one to go to the middle. Sometimes you might get lucky and get all the boxes but other times you won't. Be a third partier. Third Partiers interupt fights so they can be the winner of two fights and steal all power cubes.
---
In gem grab, the gem carrier must be protected. I get anxiety whenever my random teammate has a lot of gems so I usually like to be the gem carrier.  When I say protected, just get a rosa or el primo or something to just push the enemy team back to their spawn while the gem carrier keeps on collecting gems.
---
In heist, play someone like bull and sneak around the sides of the map. Kill people you can easily kill without being too sidetracked. This makes the enemy team have to decide, should I defend or not? If they defend, it means they cannot attack and your teammates can help you.
---
In siege, throwers are good when many walls. Otherwise choose high dps long range like colt or the spawned gang (nita, Jessie, penny) Heavyweights do work in some maps.
---
Bounty, play long range, throwers or assassins that can kill and escape.
---
Sorry got lazy for siege and bounty
---
Thats 9th MY DUDE

Welcome to jump scare stars
---
Wtf?
---
this post is so right and so relatable it hurts my brain
---
brawl box at 0 trophies.
---
That's right when I was lagging so was my teammate at the same time, for the same duration, through multiple games. Though we live in totally separate areas on separate devices and separate internet/Cellular devices. This isn't possible at all without it being more or less server side (Supercell)
---
O no
---

---
Damn right messi scored it.  Look at the enemy team fair matchmaking lmao
---
Thank you! Sorry for hurting your brain though haha Jaja!

Thank you

Nice, good luck and hope you get there! I'll give you an up arrow to start

what the fuck
---
Spike was lagging and Bibi was healing up
---
Bibi and my team didn't expect Shelly to own goal. Also I posted this cuz I think it was laughable.
---
 If you wanna have so much hate might as well ignoring this post
---
Hahaha ok but you get the idea, its obvious that supercell got some fixing to do :D
---
Thanks, Appreciated
---
i BELIEVE YOU
---
Nah if u saw it, he ran first then i ran too.
---
He shot his thermos
---
Why did they remove skull creek and thousand lakes and still lwft this? :/ worst map in my oppinion
---
That skinny Primo confuses me
---
No they didn't close the mouth they removed it too.
---
Nah this is stupid
---
Np
---
Tick is OP if you have some heavyweight

You have no idea what you are talking about. Shitposts in new are WAY better than lying about putting hours of effort into this.

Wow üò± amazing discount üòµ

"I'm in this picture and I don't like it"

It is happening the same here and with my clubmates too.
---
The account owner is still an idiot. If that's the case put the kid to play with bots, they won't be able to tell the difference and you won't fuck up someone else's game.
---
Because of the recent trophy inflation. Trophy dont mean shit. Just count the number of boxes you opened or at least you account level.
---
When tara finds her R34 fanarts
---
These bootlegs are getting better and better

 Sorry what is R34 ??
---
I‚Äôm almost there with a power 1 bibi I think I‚Äôm at 430 right now nice job tho
---
this is a beautiful map although you forgot the spawns
---
my opponents had such small brains lmao
---
But op literally never said he spend hours. You have no idea what your talking about. Also you can't tell me my opinion is wrong that's not how that works.
---
Cute idea, then you mispelled cemetery :(
---
Very epic
---
I play mortis frequently and I have never managed to steal powercubes from someone
---
Very good looking! Maybe mortis and frank could get some special effect too

Oh boy.

Cutting it short, it's porn but for literally everything that exists. Yes. There is jelly beans porn. (not like i watched that of course)

Ah ok hehe

Ik the barley thing but if you say he got free box from the shop then why it is at the bottom left? If he got the box from the shop he would already colldcted it. Did you just started playing brawl stars?

What happened?

No problem! This comic has reached its peak! It was asked for by popular demand in the comments of my past comic!

The thing is, and I said it long time ago, **Not only you don't have statistical evidence, but also you are lack of logical reasoning. And because of that, it is not an issue, it's just merely your delusional thinking.**
---
that‚Äôs pretty crazy?
---
Yea because its 2 times speed. No brawler moves that fast.
---
Low hanging fruit meme. Plus a lot seem to be believe they are never the bad random

Wtf

youll understand when u get teamed by 7 dynas and ur playing mortis

I have no friends.

Thank you very much :)

Its just sad at this point
---
It's ment as a Joke anyways haha I was thinking for barley to have him as Roberto the crazy stabbing robot from Futurama lol.
---
Sweet, that‚Äôs what I hoped, but I feel like I‚Äôve gone from 7k trophies to 12k without getting any star powers..
---
Instagram? More like Insta**bad** amirite?
---
Ok I‚Äôll leave

On a somewhat related note, I dunno what witchcraft sup erc ell did, but I can FINALLY play brawl stars on my LTE connection.
---
Before, I could never play on LTE, even if my friends connected to my LTE hotspot could play just fine. 
---
BUT HURRAH, I can play the game on my phone again!
---
Very good, you can give me tips to draw?

Slack slick you are a....

Congeats to you :)

Cuz you can't play Solo SD with a friend.Choose Duos or 3v3 if you want to invite someone

Because you're playing Solo.

I jst want to say that supercell has been doing all of these amzing stuff in such a short time I can say nothing but to say thanks

No

Lagged really fucking bad

Now that's whst i call *conten*
---
That's retarded. You shouldn't do that. Piper has the ability to deal damage the further away she is from the boss, giving her an excuse to stay away from it. Obviously, you shouldn't run with her to a corner of the map, but you shouldn't get close either. Getting close is the main risk because the boss has the ability to punch someone rapidly and deal thousands of damage in just a few seconds (depending on the difficulty). And her super lets her go close and deal some more damage to the boss or to get away from a hot fight between that 2 powercube Primo and the OP sniper bot. Besides, I once managed to get to Insane II with just a Piper on 7th level.

I see it as a rather detestable personality trait

I think it‚Äôs better get banned if dont move for 8 sec

Ppl like you r the shitty randoms that get carried by ppl like me, yall also throw ppl‚Äôs effort down the toilet with yall shitty skill now you wanna come talk shit, this one of the reason there should be a 1v1 so i could trash your shit til you rage quit

Which edition program did you use?

That's cool . Question: how do you round the top so neatly ???
---
This is so random
---
Yeahh!
---
But it wasn't advertised as limited once a year. It was advertised as a limited Christmas 2018 skin and that's what it used to say on the skin. Now it just says christmas skin. Doesnt really matter but it is false advertising which is fucked up
---
Yes :D

At least you weren't wrong about the messy part. Even if it wasn't messy, it's still terrible.

oh yeah, i feel retarded now lol

Low effort

The Brock looks like a legit Earthbound sprite.

I hate when teammates score an own goal on purpose
---
Only reason i post this is because by playing with different randoms every game i barely keep a 55% win rate but when i find two good ppl we just beatass left n right for like 10 games and i love that so much. The ones that talk shit is bc they cant relate they the trash randoms

Is that why it keeps saying it has closed in android??

Do you think they will make new holiday skins or just bring the old ones back

Leon

His face looks like he hit a glass wall. It just looks so flat.

I don't know why, but I've had much better success on cellular data than wifi, and a lot of other players have experienced the same.

This was your post from last year but now the skins will be available for people next Christmas. That's not what you said. You said that nobody will be able to grab the skins after january 3rd and you changed it without telling anyone

I am not familiar with this? Are you speaking in regards to the app not responding and saying close app? If so there were several smaller updated released to fix this issue they were not mandatory and therefore you would need to go into the Play Store and install the update manually.

They're not useless but teaming is certainly easier than taking it by yourself
---
Can we get an F for your trophies?
---
Okay that Banjo &amp; Kazooie thing is clever
---
if you saw a bot it's cause the person who played was lagging too much
---
Douch
---
I love playing Frank here.
---
What a bait and switch. I figured the replay would include Dragonforce's Through The Fire and Flames. 
---
Good escape by the way.
---
Oh yes
---
Then the 7 seconds would pass and they would get idle disconnected. It really ain't that hard
---
No this is pre match bots. If you notice simple names like Jack or bot 3 lol they are fillers for the match before it starts. You can typically tell when the games over by the x being already there or simultaneous x outs
---
Honestly I'm not sure which one looks worse

And no Shelly

oh no but actually oh yes
---
Damn, she got something hanging in there :")

why I can hear the distorced voice?
---
For me it's incredibly consistent where I will go multiple games with bots even if I close out and start a new game. All my brawlers are lvl 9 or 10 but my trophies are around 500 to 600 so I feel that is why.

They arent stupid terms lol, and m8 idc that you have some vendetta against shortening terms and using emojis n' whatnot. Get used to it or dont get on the interwebs.

No you just play bad

Because content creators started promoting giveaways for the skin and Leon brawler starting by September 7 if you see the streaming via twitch. The official release is the 13 for all players.
---
Yeah but you should add bibi
---
I feel sorry for that Rosa...
---
If the character has a super that deals damage on it's own, then it can charge the super meter. Granted, not all of those that can do that can charge it as fast as Shelly. But having that be a unique feature to shelly isnt bad, I think. 
---
The amount of damage she can do with her super, though, is bullshit.
---
That's not true, it was 50% for the old 300 which is now 500.
---
i miss playing bounty or heist everyday and I hardly play now because of it
---
Why don't we make all skins free. Oh, and we can make all brawlers unlocked. Supercell don't need money, they can design amazing games and work on them for free, who needs money
---
I don't like it tbh. while it gives certain brawlers that aren't great for most 3v3 modes a chance, it shouldn't be in rotation more than bounty and heist.
---
Tf you unbalanced it for then
---
I just upvote everything

Alright everyone I‚Äôll clarify it here. The 997 trophy shelly at rank 20 is a screenshot that I took before the update happened and before the rank 35s. That‚Äôs the only old part about the meme. The MEME itself, I created using the photoshop mix app and meme deep fryer, and then added in the old Shelly screenshot. I looked up a template of the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna stop you right there‚Äù meme and saved it to my phone, and then pasted the Shelly screenshot on it as well as the Season Reset icon. The meme itself is completely original and created by me. But the Shelly screenshot is old, like you guys said. Sorry for the misunderstanding

You‚Äôre talking about kids as if they‚Äôve never played a video game before. I think after 1 or 2 games they‚Äôd realize that the bot ai in this game is horrible and that they‚Äôre winning easily. Much more likely that the player was a troll imo

Happened to me last evening, looked like no one was playing. in fact, I got to play two times with the same exact person (showdown mode)

Yeah, I wanted to try out 8-bit‚Äôs new skin and I‚Äôve not been able to play more than at most 5 games over the last 30 mins

A lot of people trying to use 8-bit still at lower levels (less than 250 I think) and matchmaking only puts more than one on a team as a last resort.

Idk what this is supposed to symbolise but ok

Another edit. It was inevitable you would use a belittling term on me at some point, so I‚Äôm not suprised

what

Well... I wouldn‚Äôt play dyna on the current map for sure. Maybe the other Robo map, but yeah that‚Äôs a different start where you pretty much have to avoid the Robo at all costs.

Try Colt or some other high DPS brawler, totally different story then.

Thats called luck

This map is the most unfun map in the whole game, Supercell should never have added it back.

I just told I'd try to get my clubmates to use it.

Sure, but they're inversely related. Your opponent's skill at aiming counters your skill at positioning. And while the *concept* of positoning is fundamental, skill at positioning has a lot of room to improve among casual players.
---
Unless you are good at dodging, 8-bit will kill you quickly. Which means that 8-bit is extremely good at punishing lower-skill players (which needs to be toned down). It's not healthy to have a brawler that is entirely based around exploiting poor play at low levels, or who becomes game breaking at those low levels.

i can draw leon with his super activated :))

Where did you heard that from?

It was a good copy pasta

Use Ookla's speed test app, it tells ping and packet loss. Whenever I have more than 10-15% packet loss, the game lags.

tf are ypu talking about? he/she never said those don't charge super. and this whole thread is talking about how shelly charges super really fast with her super so it's unfair for brawlers that don't attack with super. you should go and learn what people are talking about

Because even though people want to act tough and want to 1v1 each other it shows like no skill in this game, even if it was without bots and you were the same brawler because leon v leon or any same brawler interactions are boring and usually it‚Äôs just you and the other guy shooting each other at your range and moving back and forwards to try to hit them when they follow. Here‚Äôs what I think would be more fun.
---
Think about siege, you collect bolts to create a strong robot to make a big push on the other team. What if the objective in a 1v1 was also focused on collecting resources to getting stronger. You could summon different allies to help you(to make it simple every 30 seconds or so you can pick one out of 3 options that appear on screen and then that ally spawns) now this could be like 1v1 siege or 1v1 heist but instead of a safe as the target you are the target but you have about the same health as the big brawler in big game. So you use your resource you pick up just like gems bolts cubes. And the more you have the more you allies you spawn. This is an incomplete idea I could use some more ideas on this. I‚Äôm thinking maybe we could add a life steal element where each time you attack you get 25 or 50 health of your attack so your encouraged to attack(this would only work by attacking the other player not allies). Health decay may also be needed to ensure games are around 3-4 minutes because I don‚Äôt want a timer on these games I want one player to fall to 0 health to crown the other player as the winner every single game. It could also have some defenses as an option(this would work by having some broken down areas on the map and every time you have the option to select an ally you could also instead of picking an ally you could pick a defense to be rebuilt. Again it‚Äôs just 3 circles with and image of either an ally or defense you select what you want and it comes just so it‚Äôs simple and fast).

I think any star power which does damage that you don't do without it doesn't charge super. ex pam and poco's second star power and as you know, tara's first star power
---
Why you stole that
---
Her star powers would spawn a real Tara
---
agree we don't have that much ticketed events
---
Also, I ended up in one of his live-streams
---
I see your a Man/Women of culture as well.
---
PIZZA BOT
---
Baby Shark tototootooo
---
he would be visible as long as he has the sword in his hand. and you can hardly kill anyone with bare fists
---
What i think he means is that it basically fully charges it but that‚Äôs only when it‚Äôs a up close shot kuz each individual shell adds to the super
---
Great ideas as always! You‚Äôre reworking Burn and Blaze right?
---
Bounty or heist is as good imo. Now it gets blocked out by siege which everyone hates.
---
no the star power that charges super
---
The piper is probably like uhh piper sucks and where is my teammate going?

That‚Äôs what stopped me from upvoting...

Yes sirüòä

***the credit is in the template***
---
%30 is pretty low, can be %60
---
No it‚Äôs not
---
Lol I was nita
---
Whats horseshit is Mama's Squeeze doesnt charge starpower when it does damage.
---
Very cute
---
Yes I can see that being a huge issue for you particularly along with anybody else playing mortis. Or now how about playing 8bit as he is so slow to begin with let's hope he doesn't lag hahaha.
---
Sorry if this is kinda cringe lol
---
Ya know what I hate?  This post will get lost instead of making front page.  This is a great tip and strategy that needs to be heard.
---
Seems a little op but ok
---
Arcade machines don't have WiFi(most) so they don't lag. Simple

Boom Beach? This is Rush Wars!

His hand is backwards D:

Haha Jaja! üíØ

Trash

I made an error on the shading! Dang it
---
share your thoughts :)
---
Thousand lakes was one of the only showdown maps with an actually diverse meta, you could play pretty much any brawler and still have a decent chance of winning
---
Nah, if youre talking about @8Bit_Gaming on insta, thats me

You were typing in teamchat weren‚Äôt you

Go right ahead! I don't mindüòä

Can swap the head to other brawlers (Primo:  HODL 10 Gems and win match or use super to jump to enemy team)
---
Seen that glitch happen to a super bouncing off boxes but I dunno
---
Angry birds crow*

Piper you can shoot me anyday too

Edgy kids

Good job replicating the style! I've always tought it kinda sucked that they moved away from the western asthetic but these designs are really cool!
---
HEY, stop
---
can you stop shaking the scream like you have issues, jesus
---
I mean circling eagle doesn't change the fact that a lvl 1 shelly can stack supers or bull can explode Bo in 3 shots.
---
Why would u play tick in cavern churn
---
Do u have dyna-jump

Swear to god this is me every morning when I need to play gem grab üòÇ

You‚Äôre funny man, showdown actually teaches you to dodge

we have:

a fucked up neck
---
Lol sorry, Lets take things slower my bad.
---
and there‚Äôs no point of it every time, it just ruins ur vision of what‚Äôs happening and looks annoying
---
Nice but this isn't that lucky. Getting a legendary/mythic would be more luckier since i'm pretty sure that an Epic+Rare isn't that rare. Correct if i'm wrong but good drop!
---
I had the same issue, was nervous to ask till I started messing with my settings lol
---
It was literally 2v2.
---
Yes I am interested :)
---
What‚Äôs going on dude? Need to talk or something?
---
so what
---
ok so u dont have to comment that, most of the comments that you post are hate comments
---
who downvoted lol
---
Tnx ManüëçüèΩ
---
This acc does not have el primo
---
Is El Fugeo good or is meteor rush just better? I'm deciding whether or not to wait for meteor rush or coiled snake.
---
How much do you play every day? Is this even healthy what you're doing? Also congratulations!
---
Make blaze and burns name shorter like recent brawler names

I love how people think mega=brawler. It doesn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs literally just 10 boxes packed into 1. And your legendary odds are never gonna be 10%

Is 44 views on my Brawl stars vid considered small?
---
If you use nita on this map and use her bear as a locater in the middle you are 300iq

Guys, I feel like you're addicted. Just sayin.

My favourite map, can practice my dyna jumps and win most battle with him. Plus all those outplays against mortis was so fun
---
We do it at 4 mach speed
---
Its big brain time
---
. ƒ∞f you could watch the replays you wouldnt talk like that. And how can you call someone you dont know 'moron'.
---
People just complain to much, yes this game is p2w (only a little much less than other Supercell/mobile games), yes some brawlers don't have skins, yes matchmaking can kind of suck, and yes some brawlers still need remodels/ balance changes. But the game is still good, and with Supercell it will be good for a long time. Yes criticism is extremely important but so is realizing how it's a good game, with great devs, and aside from annoying kids who complain too much a good playerbase.
---
Looks kinda like Alice from SAO
---
True man true!
---
This guy starts getting unstoppable
---
With that amount of gems, I would just save up for a legendary

Thats Cool Idea!

---
Hey hey! :D Thanks

Wow, in only 3 hours someone has managed to use this format to make the shittiest meme possible. Hopefully this format can actually make people create good memes

Tysm

I'd definitly go for special magnum unless it's robo fight(?) that fighting big robot with tickets. But my colt isn't even power 10 :/
---
What‚Äôs your brothers ign then we can get the skin off namemc
---
Almost as annoying as sorting by new
---
I remember it having that much cactuses cuz u know *sad darryl noises*
---
Lol I'm 15.4k, 8k is nothing
---
Bruh you know how much gold is needed to upgrade? This will make the game more p2w. This post is pretty useless.
---
Oh yeah! Almost exactly
---
Looks like you cant answer huh. 'Moron'
---
Sadly I‚Äôm pretty sure there are grown adults dumb enough to fall for that crap too
---
Big ^Oof^ for that Piper
---
Yeah that's how it be...
