Thanks

Idk

I was blowing my nose and saw the picture, dead ass my nose is clear now

*so you have Leon*

It's to be expected with such a skin or Leon in general.
---
Excuse me while I chew my pills

*cries in not having enough gems for either of them*

(I‚Äôm not f2p but I‚Äôve spent like $5 on the game)

There is a bug

Ok, thank you!

For a moment I thought you were talking about the brawler Leon until I saw bricks name
---
Even better.
---
Oh
---
I hate the poopies who do this
---
I am sorry for the inconvenience but you didn't had to bruh me. Also infuriating fact zoom in on the third line, you can see that it's not straight

So cool

#HE SAID HIS BRAWL STARS IS WEIRD

that seems pretty low, considering this is for peiple who reach 14k+ trophies. What about 1%?
---
Lol, yeah I heard he just got sponsored...
---
I have no understanding of this image
---
smooth, love how they all went at you in a straight line
---
She talks to Scrappy like it's a real dog so maybe
---
I mean my Legendary Chance right now is 0.2%, so an extra 0.1% chance is a 50% Buff. Also when you open a certain amount of boxes and it goes up, it only goes up by 0.01%. It could boost it by 0.2% instead of 0.1% just so the impact is a little more noticeable.
---
Looking thicc! ‚ô•Ô∏èüòè
---
hmmm, seems reasonable
---
Slash and dash your opinion is trash
---
But Leon is still good tbh but cause he's a legendary he has to be better so supercell pls buff him
---
This map kinda sucks
---
Ehhhhh he only had 1 place to go
---
Lost 3 times in like 5 minutes total :// i don't think siege should be part of power play. It's broken, enemy wins wit lv1 siege

1% is WAY too much. Wouldn‚Äôt that be half the chances of getting a RARE brawler?
---
I wish i put this much effort into my essays
---
Pretty much wrong
---
I don't understand .... Does it means that teamer will protect the weak player against strong player ?ü§îü§î
---
BTW it's normal to attack other brawlers in takedown to charge super and use it against the bot
---
We will all get used to his voice, because when mortis voice people at first thought it was kinda cringy but now people think it is pretty cool, it will be the exactly the same with leon, we will all get used to his voice and people will eventually be fine with bis voice.

Literally siege broke my won streak. All wins and 1 siege loss. Siege is the worst game mode.

 jessie‚Äôs turret: gets destroyed in 2 seconds

I am not understand ... üò´ Explain please ~

that was the point

Hate to break it to you fam but thats every couple months. Last time he was in shop he was with Spike. There was also the time all 3 were on sale.

Imagine getting boosted...

Lmao your serious? That‚Äôs not what the term means

Many, many times

U can still attack the Dyna tho

Can you do any better?

Hope it gets lost in new.

I did but the video became blur

Nice Art! üëåüèΩ

Yes. Make a big spot showing their health. Remove the mark showing their location. Let's know they're almost dead and try find them...

Ok, just add credits. What‚Äôs the name of your channel?

Sharks don't have scales

Not necessarily, getting power cubes from enemy beaters deny them damage, and let you do more damage to the bot. It‚Äôs basically an investment. If your Super bar is empty all game, you are playing the game wrong

I used penny and im killing the  whole team alone

What does Ike mean

Honestly I'd say give it two months, he might just go on sale again for christmas time along with the other legendary brawlers.

So would it just follow you or crash and damage you even if you weren't close

Alright

Keep them

Hey are fun to open in mass

You can infer by when he cut the video off

They can't just goal the have to trickshot so they can flex on this

maybe you can just hold up a sign, that is much harder for these people to crop out. maybe even have it say "I am a creature of the night" with your username below

Don‚Äôt get pissed

Ah fuck another one of these
---
Shameless, really... but I guess they ‚Äòmight‚Äô have their own unique ‚Äòbrawlers‚Äô, but it‚Äôs still kinda shameless

Oh so it's a glitch. Could you take a video and upload it so supercell can fix it
---
I was at 750-ish with Darryl, now I‚Äôm stuck at 700

Nice idea this is actually my third aquatic brawler idea the other 2 are on my old Reddit account brawlboicharm also nice to meet you it's always fun to chat about brawler ideas to other people atleast to me.

I made a post with screenshots a month ago i think.. since then i never play siege even for once. I can't do screen record that time because my brawler had trophy under 400, so i can't watch replay to record
---
Oh...
---
You now have three legendaries!Wow such a lucky man!
---
Rico needs 1100/210
---
I don't think that's possible. Like physically.
---
Once you're marked, its fixated on you regardless of your position. If they did what you said, and included your actual position, there would be so many factors. That's why they either take your final or initial position. If you take both, there will be situations where players can go in and out and then the rocket gets bugged, there's so many things to calculate, just not a good idea. Imagine the rocket changing direction midflight, and then you suddenly go back and then it changes again to hit you.

Thanks for the very good comment! I played since the beta and i Remember when auto aim were introduced what that bring into the community, i totally agree that auto aim is viable if you know enough were it will shot to just have a faster input. Anyway i just wanted to say, believe or not, me(8bit) i did that on purpose since was so sudden i didn't knew if i aim it right but i was trying to change his aim in case he was autoaiming
---
The best content on yt fir wxample mokeys show
---
No, it really isn't. In niche situations, sure. Overall, I'd literally take every other brawler in the game instead of her on the team. She's so useless in Siege. Every time I see her on my team, a little part of me dies inside because I know I'm going to waste 2 minutes in a fat loss.
---
Not even robo retreat or meteor rush can help you dodge the ike's bullets
---
For a minute, I was wondering where is the Leon.
---
post it in r/mortis gang
---
Ok, that‚Äôs it. I‚Äôm done with chests.
---
Was it you that /u/Middle_Hotel is talking about lol
---
I think giving 700 gems to F2P's is a bad idea. Cuz they can to do everything with all those gems, u can't be certain if someone will use those gems for a new legendary or for buying skins/star powers.

She looks more like a Japanese than an indian

At best you have an ally that storms opponents &amp; the robots with her attacks &amp; Super. More often, you have a pelter strategist. At worst, #spin2win.

Holy shit mate I wasn‚Äôt expecting an essay yo. Thanks man! I‚Äôll keep that in mind.
---
Sir I shall join you in the revolution of f2p gladly as my flexing friends are 2k with every brawler and every skin except star point
---
But you are a leon
---
Why don't we ban Penny from siege?
---
No
---
I'm pretty sure it already works like that.
---
what do players, who want to help you,require?
---
This glitch was discovered just some what after bibi was released
---
It‚Äôs just colt misses a lot and Shelly is well a shotgunner except her super makes her frustrating 
---
Mortis can kill the long range and throwers but the thing is they can easily kill him too
---
With Leon though he is better then the 4 I suggested cause leon is a strong ‚Äúassasin‚Äù I don‚Äôt get what people think of him his main role is to kill high value targets (like the gem carrier, or some guy with a lot of stars) and just in general leon can kill about anybody he wants when he has his super since (except for some exceptions like bull and Shelly) but he can basically kill anybody and have a ez time doing it cause his invisiblility allows him to
---
What means F2P
---
He doesnt. He is pretty balanced, only people ive seen complain about this (a.k.a cry) is leon flairs..they probably get countered by crows and think he needs a nerf and leon a buff xD. They want leon to become broken like the first day of his release, I swear.

so this wasn't inspiration at all for you? I mean the pose is very similar, and so is the nose, muscles, etc.
---
Watermark it ffs
---
I used Rico, a supposedly B tier brawler and got 1 loss and 2 epic wins
---
If we can see in what percentage we are in,it will be handy,and if they allow more matches for power play then we can decide how much to grind and atuff like that

Always put your Reddit r/username on your work!

Learning that how to juke, aim, memorise the maps, abilitys, star powers etc.

In clash royale you just place troops down and cant even controll it so what is the skill you need
---
why do most of the people dress as Leon?
---
Why did you downvote
---
Just because hes good in showdown and graveyard shift doesnt mean he needs a nerf. Hes not that great in 3v3...
---
What game is it?

Slow claps.

Yup, when I meant Japanese brawler, I was thinking about Bibi, because of her voice lines ‚ÄúKonichi-whack‚Äù and ‚ÄúSayonara‚Äù, meaning that Bibi is 100% Japanese. Idk about 8-bit because there really is no evidence of him being in any nationality, but he could be Japanese.

No, thats not how you play xD

That's a familiar username. I wonder if that's me if you could share that Bull's user id
---
Hahahaha randoms bad.
---
Also leon is fine as he is now. Just play him in showdown or lone star. I pushed him to 600 at power lvl 7 and had no problems.
---
Wait you have a legendary? I'm 13k and don't even have any legendary or Rico.

If we stopped posting, then these people would have to make actual content.

 I dont get it
---
youve never played tuber simulator?

Nays
---
Bruh, he sucks at lower levels because people are noob and dont know how to use him. And he is really strong. Probably the best legendary rn because of the burst damage. And he isnt only a tank killer, he is also a good control in 3v3 gamemodes, and also really good in showdown and takedown because of the burst damage. And with star power he is even better. Definetely top tier, and the fact that youre bad with him doesnt interest me.
---
His weapon should be an ice pick then
---
Wow
---
Looks very nice. Well done!
---
Kys
---
The only problem with the map is that if you play mortis double trower and get the first star with mortis the trowers can just spam the one entrance
---
You are right

Did you watch part 5? Cuz this is similar to golden wind's polnarref pose
---
Seriously?

I like how it's drawn, but the body proportions seem smaller than the head?
---
Honestly I miss playing bounty every second day
---
I said maybe. And I didnt say legendary. Although the chances are small. You can always get lucky and 40 is not nothing. But yes most people won't pull a legendary and I know how hard it is to pull one cause I had 17k without them. Still waiting

Thank you

Leon stills sucks in 3v3 gamemodes. "Colt misses alot" isnt an excuse, the fact that youre bad with him is your problem, not mine. So aim your shots. With mortis, you can dodge their shots and then das on them with coiled snake. If you dont have coiled snake, he is a little bit weaker.

---
Nice. I had a powerplay game where i was piper (only max brawler, the brawl ball sucked) and I was with a mortis (poor guy, probably his only maxed brawler). We were constantly dying and just barely surviving, and when the map was small there were two teams left with us having no powerups and the other teams having heaps. Suprisingly they didn't go after us and we had half to ourselves, and they killed each other till there was one guy left and all it took was one piper shot. other two games I won aswell by a landslide. Hope powerplay goes well for you
---
because the DOT on sandy's super is more like chip damage, it's not the main focus of his kit.
---
I am fully f2p
---
I have everything max but not sandy i am at 14,5k and f2p

No no no, the price of 150 gems is almost 2 mega voxes hence the 1.85

yup, it is.
---
It says 23d.
---
it should have gone down by 0.1 because when you get 1 it goes down by 0.05 so im calling bs you had even worse chances
---
I get a lot of top 4 places in takedown (lots of wins) and i use colt, and I attack the bot **unless** im not near the boss (still moving towards it), the boss has its shield, I am not in range or they are blocking me. I will get my super 2-3 times a match and use it on the boss. People are idiots if the think you can't attack others in takedown. It wins you the match. They're probs just salty for other skilling them and losing

I hope

Feel alone with bull cuz both star powers seems good

Shes balanced you just suck

Can I name it dead trend?
---
K.
---
Getting 3 gems from 100 brawlboxes is more than getting 27 gems from a single brawlbox.
---
To find the reason why, calculate 3 times 100. You know that its 300. 300 &gt; 27. So I don't get why people must get angry from this type of situation where you only get 3 gems from all 100 brawlboxes you open and a youtuber gets 27 gems from a single brawlbox they open.
---
This is opinioal and this "meme" is low-effort filler.
---
When piper and 8 bit gets nerfed I believe crow will be the one of the strongest brawlers in-game

Actually forgot to give you a brain :P

well just play the game dude ive been playing for half a year and i already have half the brawlers

Someone help me do woosh I don't get the joke.

You have to take to account how fun brawler lis to play.

Woosh

Bull's probably not. Bull seems to be from the Wild West, look at his boots, vest, and shotgun.

The dark one is called shadow knight Jessie lol

passing the ball to teammate close to goal so they score makes them useful.

Delete this whining. Bralw stars is now alive more than ever. If you don't like the game, just don't play it .

How did you come to the conclusion that I said Bibi is Indian. Also I wasn't really interpreting your comment as you saying that no other language can have a word I was just putting out a statement, but I guess I didn't word it that way.

only my tick is at 549 I'm waiting for power 10 tick rn

at least u survived for 4 mins straight

Waiit there actually is a 1,8k trophies 8-bit does it mean since it stops at 1,299k he has 0 star points at the end of the season ?ü§î

Shelly doesn't need a nerf. Sshe needs a *rework*. She destroys any close ranged brawler with ease yet struggles to defeat a single long ranged brawler, which is ironic since she was designed to be a "middle ground" brawler who is supposed to deal with both close and long ranged brawlers

Ok.......... :)

haha patrick says 'wat'
---
I wasn't suggesting a 1 shot, but it's still heavily in leon's favour even with a power cube imbalance.
---
piper needs a nerf
---
:D
---
Sorry
---
English translate- Zombie Leon
---
Thanks :)
---
*F for those 2100 star points*
---
Now they nerfed Piper and I think she‚Äôs no longer OP (-40 damage)
---
–ü–µ—Ä–µ–≤–æ–¥ –ø–æ–∂–∞–ª—É–π—Å—Ç–∞
---
I do agree pay to win is annoying but I have almost all the brawlers(except crow sandy and Leon). I‚Äôm free to play. It just takes time.
---
Nita isn't that bad. She's slightly worse than Jessie in terms of dps but in the later stages shes a beast with her bear with me starpower.
---
Damn sexy furry Leon...
---
Yes. Yes it is.
---
Maybe he's Japanese since the hairstyle is the one from Japanese vandals gang it was also hinted that bull is from retropolis which could be a brawlified version of the environment of Japan but since he has also wild west vibes it's kind of confusing maybe they change the ideas of his plot since before all of that brawl world it was just supposed to be wild west theme
---
Impressive
---
I feel you
---
Can you please keep your preferences for having sexual intercourse with furries out of the Brawlstars reddit please? much appreciated
---
Well yes,but actually no.You can kill people for don't letting them to give damage to boss.But if u are killing people all the game and not to boss,you are stupid.
---
I know how you feel, whenever I spin it‚Äôs like ‚Äúoh your nice let‚Äôs go our separate ways :D‚Äù
---
Sneaky stealing
---
you can actually buy Leon hoodie in Poland [here](https://allegro.pl/oferta/bluza-dziecieca-brawl-stars-leon-zielona-158-48h-8623783157)
---
How much trophies do you have? Dont lie
---
And then you realize you are 8-bit
---
I learned it new bro ty so much
---

---
CRBULA
---
LOL
---
 woah thats some dedication! 18 days!
---
Yes i fucking am romanian, why do you even care or ask lol?
---
Push her to 1000 trophies then u can nerf her ok thx bye.
---
BORING
---
porque catrina es un personaje t√≠pico del d√≠a de los muertos en Mexico, y ella b√°sicamente est√° vestida de eso
---
Someone from my club is 1547 with spike and crow
---

---

---
#LuckyGang
---
Canada first, Finland second
---
Behind the vault
---
lucky i wish i had those
---
And you make a post nerf shelly and say she beats a whole team... pathetic im at 17k and she is very well balanced now.
---
I know, i can explain how it works if you want
---
That means you still have time
---
tupoy_igrok*
---
it's not your post wtf
---
A person with no-brain does that üòÇ
---
that wasn't irony I had no idea what he meant
---
i actually almost came when i saw this skin in brawl talk
---
why Russians..they don't understand that they're shaming Russian players with that shit.
---
its ok
---
Yes pkease. Im very confused.
---
Maybe you say she don‚Äôt need a nerf Because is the reason you‚Äôre at 17k trophies
---
you can edit comments btw - just click the 3 dots
---
The third is the afk shelly that loses you your tickets
---
2.5k I got spike recently...
---
Tis my duty to say. Git gud.
---
Thay won't put 69 in the game map
---
C u r s e d
---
did they nerf his damage to?
---
yes
---
And nevermind.
---
600 is low, but your point was right. Leon is not for 3v3, he is good in solo modes
---
Is it me or does she look old ._.
---
Never
---
well, no, but actually yes
---
That mortis got a big head no brainn
---
Your ruining the joke.. makes us look bad
---
Some people who hate Siege (including myself) Don't like the difficulty and sometimes the unfairness.
---
 I stopped playing it completely when there were alternative things you can do besides using robots.
---
Cause idk iM dRuNk
---
Why the game hates me three
---
First of all, i like the fact that you made stats for her, but also kairostime wasnt the only one who talked about Buffy in their video.  
---
Second, you could have at least gave credit to the guy who made the brawler idea.
---
okie dokie
---
I guess so
---
Froget abaut mortis , it is from Romania !!!!
---
And we wanna see brawl stars celebratin 1th december beacose its Romania s birhday
---
Amazing, Gardevoir is my favorite Pokemon and Piper is one of my favorite brawlers 11/10
---
Thx I worked really hard on this pun
---
In duo*
---
I have piper aimbot did you know how to do it you go to google type how to nerf... Shelly and its automatically gives you pibot
---
There are no likes on Reddit
---
Yeah, since trophies rework and new brawlers it‚Äôs been much easier
---
yes you can, when it's ON SALE
---
Nice very cool see you in hot
---
Im actually proud...
---
Then why did you play him?  
---
Also if you want some good maps for Mortis, just use [starlist.pro](https://starlist.pro)
---
Teaming is officially an strategy frank confirmed
---
The limited skins will be back eventually. Except Star Shelly, that's an exclusive one
---
It's NOT nice to be at 69 "trophies" at power race right now
---
Nice.
---
Very true :(
---
It would be like:
---
Nana
---
Danadada
---

Dan da dan da dan da dan dan piu piu dan dan dan siu
---
Gues what intro song i made
---
I'm sorry but i do not like this map at all.
---
Ok bro ;P (I still think Shelly need a nerf but I don‚Äôt say it anymore)
---
Put your water mark or it will get stealed
---
See you in hot
---
I rather die
---
That‚Äôs a bot

Yeah with the amount of Upvotes this is getting

Pretty basic not gonna lie
---

Nice i hope you to see you in hot
---
P.s.s im to
---
Not all of them are bad, but it's hard to find good ones. You got lucky
---
Colt is my list favorite brawler
---
EVERYONE, LETS REPORT HIM!!!!!!
---
Let‚Äôs all report him.. that‚Äôs all
---
hmm not related huh
---
EMZ is balanced, 8-Bit is very situational
---
I don't get what you're trying to say here.
---
I agree. I use reverse image search too sometimes, especially when op's account is like 1 day old
---
Special move... Hh sounds familiar
---
when you win a fight aganist your brother but then you say 'i fucked your mom'
---

---
You also have spike?
---
mhm
---
Ye sadly i dont know who that guy was :(
---
Bot Frank with Star Power: A M A T E U R S
---
I just want werewolf leon but i have 87 gems
---
They can like what they want, but the problem is that these ‚ÄúOG‚Äù players are constantly whining about how it‚Äôs not fair that global players have legendaries and that they deserve them more because they‚Äôve played longer and are now above 14k. They hate on global players for no reason other than not playing in beta, which, might I remind you, was not a global beta. You had to be in select countries to even play beta.
---
Ahh Russians...
---
Hm seems printed out
---
im not supposed to give my opinion
---
Gene and tara
---
Im an arab i can say gene is 100% true but im not sure about tara tho
---
Leon gets countered easily at 800+ in 3v3, same with crow tbh. You don‚Äôt see them as much in higher trophy matches cuz brawlers like spike, bibi and sandy just rule those areas
---
Right!
---
uno reverse card
---
upvotes\*
---
Ah I see from what looks like happened it got hit then stunned which briefly stopped it before it got the knock back of Bibi's swing
---
By ways. 
---
And means.
---
Well you have 2 legendaries from what I see, the game clearly doesn't hate you.
---
The bear moves like 1 second after it should have (if it even should have moved at all).
---
*Attempt a risky trick shot, but fail miserably
---
Thx
---
Because...their connection was bad?
---
I was thinking of that too, It would not be bad
---
its obvious that you tilted after reaching 3k
---
Daring today, aren‚Äôt we?
---
So cute
---
Yes how dare he
---
I‚Äôll try my best I won‚Äôt waste my ticket :/
---
*print out
---
 Imo it gives leon a new look which is the point of skins
---
I was just gonna ask the same thing.
---
For non-french speaking people, I think he said he wants unlockable brawlers with Star points, star points and gems in Trophy Road, and a brawler that can teleport (I think)
---
Pretty Good :)
---
Yea sure
---
Effects also suck because most of the time Leon fights in close range so you won't see them anyway. And he doesn't even have an effect for his super.
---
i wouldn't play rr with randoms in the first place because i know things like this will happen.
---
You‚Äôre welcome! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Frank showed some stats on Twitter...the average amount of trophies is 4.5k......people that want an extension of the trophy road are barely 1% of the player base.....stop whining....the trophy road might not be extended for another year or so....
---
Players could get boosted to a high trophy amount and are consistently bad whereas someone else carries.
---
oh shit oh fuck he called Leon sexy
---
Nah leon is still super lol u have to use hime right
---
Mortis's and Piper's seconds requieres more skill to use than the first
---
Sure man I'm not saying you're wrong, some people just think differently
---
You want to do 100k daily uploads and streams? Oh boy that will get hard, i mean impossible, even if you upload 100k 1second videos, it would take you more than a day
---
Not actually the same. If you are not maxed, powerpoints from small boxes will be divided to more brawlers
---
I think they should increase the view angle a bit so its more like a bird's eye view. This sucks especially when playing Piper in showdown/takedown/lone star and you spawn on the upper side of the map.
---
Yes it's that
---
bruh. they give us the option to buy boxes with star points as a compromise
---
how do you check your chance?
---
In my eyes there is two types of teaming.
---
1. Teaming up with ONE other brawler against a common enemy  sometimes more is acceptable.  An example of when more is acceptable is throwers teaming up on cavern churn. End game they have to enter the bushes where they will certainly be massacred so yes while it is annoying it is necessary.
---
2.  Spinning to team there is no other threat except for this brawler and you spin to team. Especially toxic if more than one.
---
Plot twist:*You get a star power bcz of your lvl9 Shelly.*
---
*laugh in dyna-jump*
---
IKR. I hope cavern churn will become a takedown or lone star map then the storm can‚Äôt take it. Only yeeters
---
I have Paint it
---
I always use Pam (have both SP) with randoms in RR so that I can help others that doesn't have max brawlers to 6+ minutes, but they always use noncompatible brawlers (especially the ones that can destroy the walls), which made me cannot carry them
---
Once I teamed up with a lv.1 Mortis and lv.2 Dynamike, and somehow we passed 5+ minutes
---
If you meet me as a random in RR, feel free to add as a friend :)
---
And u finally get to them, only to see invisible leon with smoke trails to pick them all up
---
U get 75 likes from me
---
It's worse, way worse
---
darryl
---
You are meh!
---
Now I feel proud of myself, knowing italian and learning french does serve well
---
It's actually impressive to miss so many trickshots though
---
Why i hear piper shoots?
---
Shelly: lol nope
---
And an upside down L and a small T
---
You printed this dumbass and quit asking for UPVOTES
---
Can someone explain, I dont have 8 bit or Emz
---
The credit for this meme template goes to who I would call the God of Reddit, u/SrGrafo, go check him out if you don't know him! He is the best! (Also he is on the bottom right)

\*It's a thing in reddit that people don't use emojis called r/EmojiPolice\*

Thanks!

*Menacing*

What? He means centering the camera a bit below the center of the screen. No ones changing any 3D. The graphics would stay the same.
---
Thanks dude!
---
somebody who attacks people in takedown apparently can‚Äôt swallow this pill
---
I think what he needs is a rework. I just posted an idea for what this rework could be, you can read it if you dont mind :)

Opponents: Am I a joke to you?

LITERALLY ME

Same

Nice! After ??? Months of playing, I just got my first brawler (Piper) to level 9 but most of the star powers are pretty boring :(

Edit: her star power is in the shop the day I commented this!!! But I spent all my coins upgrading her T-T

I know :)

Well, I admit, I went a little overboard, but still, be nice. These are some of my first posts here. All of my posts ever have been insulted, never got more that 5 upvotes, or gotten removed by mods. Just be nice.
---
Ooo! I like it! Another name could be substantial shift but I also like magic valley
---
Guys dont freak out hes speaking the language of gods
---
I suggest there isn‚Äôt roses behind her because if she is trying to get in a bush and start hiding a rose will on the outside for a few seconds letting them know she‚Äôs in there. Over all great effects and should be added to her skin! üëçüèª
---
See you in hot!
---
How do you edit like that?
---
Awesome

Who else noticed that colt did 420 damage

That means there will be one more trophy brawler as the little icons change so we got Emz for the Hellish dude Icon and now there's the last one.

Really well done good job!
---
No offense but I dont see how wearing a shark skin can help sharks. Its not like supercell is giving money to any NGOs right?

Thank you!

And you ofcourse

And get so faaar
---
To be honest, it is. Most people on the enemy team had Long Range brawlers whilst we had mostly short ranged. Plus, they had two power 10s.
---
Played the Mortis like a fiddle
---
Sorry, there are too many fan art about ghostbuster Pam :(

To anyone that doesn't understand, look at the power levels.

I am at 8.5 k and have 27 brawlers

This meme was made about 6 months ago
---
I‚Äôm glad they aren‚Äôt. It was fun going thru it but I like that they extended it with star points. I love that I now get skins and mega boxes instead of a few coins or power points.

Are you gonna trace the whole 9 pages too?

Go to the shop and tap on a big box or mega box. Then tap on the "i" in the corner to see your odds for everything.

With some jumpads it would be perfect.

How did you do this?

Is calavera piper a limited skin?

No offence but i bought night which mortis instead of her
---
Hey man, I see your name and had a question. Are you from a latin country?
---
Emoji no
---
Me: *comes with Pam*
---
Matchmaking and randoms: Alright I'm gonna put a Nita and an El Primo next to ya!
---
Ye but the skin will be back in the next year halloween
---
Srry for my english
---
Brawl stars: "Ok you had your fun"
---
Because mortis can‚Äôt win showdown without teaming and people who want to throw use mortis because he can easily dash to get the ball. M
---
I have night Witch Mortis already üòÅü•ß
---
U welcome :)
---
Tbh i saw lots of posts with that title
---
I got my first one at 15.5k...
---
Or what about Candy Skulls for her super, idk thats just my suggestion
---
Randoms negeer dissapear.
---
She is dead, she doesn't need a Parasol to fly or land
---
Tick..
---
&gt;!hahaha got ya!&lt;

Now make Minecraft characters in brawl stars

It happened to me once but it went away immediately

I have power 9 Brock but no star power :(

Use a jessie

i also have lag (i'm from iran too) but it is not too much it just happens on certain maps with a retropolis or mortuary environment
---
r/Itswooooshwith4os
---
why would you expect more for 80 gems lol, 30-80 gem skins are just a recolor.
---
But in the end..
---
Just buy it and hope they change it like the Summer and Dragon Knight skins
---
Yes ! Atleast they make it unlock in lvl 20
---

Bruh my 3v3 wins are less than 1% of yours
---
And on PE damn!
---
Are this dudes ideas in the actual game?
---
Cool
---
im completely f2p and im only missing crow at 10k
---
Honestly tho wtf. Give us a skin im sick of this.
---
that's my brother right there
---
He needs 7-8 seconds for his super
---
yum let me destroy that map with my coiled snake mortis
---
You also can see the winning team got +8 trophies
---
7.7/10
---
Bruh bobby has over 40k wins‚Ä¶
---
say sike right now
---
this is not me i can't win that much :/
---
The fact there are so many players at around 4500 trophies could indicate two things:
---
- there are a lot of new players coming in. And, even though newer players are practically guaranteed a certain amount of brawlers before they have to heavily depend on their actual box RNG (hence the 4k player with a legendary brawler meme), it still isnt much.
---
- and tieing back to my previous point, brand new players aren't going to be that skilled. So pushing their brawlers beyond a certain point, especially if that brawler is lacking in power level, it becomes a grind. 
---
Supercell has this game made primarily for longevity. Even with the inflated trophy count, unskilled players are a dime a dozen. Until they actually improve, they'll keep fumbling around in the lower trophy range.
---
Yes, i knew it! piper is a guy
---
And there is no *Legendaries for f2p*
---
R/Minecraft
---
Oh shoot my bad but still
---
really? btw i found this player in the leaderboard
---
You also get lvl 10 brawlers everytime you play game rooms
---
Am I the only one Who thinks The first star Power its kinda op, i mean 2400 HP with his attacks
---
Yeah it does kinda exist
---
&gt;!ticket events!&lt;
---
But even you can't deny it's an interesting title.

no only brawlers that you get from boxes will lower your box chances, he's wrong

---
You are so intelligent! If you haven't got Leon, that's sucks. (Use your mom's credit card and buy him, and buy all of LEGENDARYS! üòà) If your have Leon, buy Werewolf skin and go to HAPPY and stop hate!
---
No, they‚Äôre trying to get Leon‚Äôs winrate in one specific mode (Lone Star) down and he‚Äôs suffering in every other mode as a result. At least, he would be, except Invisiheal is now OP and Leon is now both a decent assasin and a pretty good tank.
---
But you‚Äôre right, without a star power base Leon is not good right now, and ideally Leon should have a buff to his base stats and a nerf to both star powers. Perhaps Supercell could restore the seventh second of invisibility but reduce Smoke Trails‚Äô boost to 21% and reduce Invisiheal‚Äôs effect to 800 HP? Basically pre-nerf Leon except Smoke Trails is a little worse so neither star power is overpowered.

What you just said makes zero sense üòÇ

Nice piece of work üëçüèø

If you said,‚Äùgive me‚Äù, that actually would have been pretty funny lol.
---
But yeah, how much do you want him for? üòÇ
---
Heres how it works: you invite your friend and tell him or her not not be ready. Then you click ready and brawlers at the same time. Then tell your friend to ready and there it is! Btw this information was from another reddit user not by me
---
You dumb bitch it's hair spray

Thanks!!!

You don‚Äôt have a Crow flair...

Awesome idea! But it should be a bit smaller other then that it would be Perfect!

Well, i must thank you for not being such a dick about it! Cheers friend!

That's just what I think.

it‚Äôs obvious dude took the zeros with him

That's bad luck but 18.5k with only 1 legy isn't lucky either

Great man

True

I hope you will get an legendary soon

Says the one who uses this garbage template

And I see you are suddenly getting cold feet about calling her out for tracing and are now spamming ‚Äúdon‚Äôt witch hunt‚Äù on every comment pointing that out in hopes that it would somehow do something.

Buy buy buy buy...

have you tried tara and piper? leon and poco? Ive seen some hard bullshit every game
---
I dont really want a turret tanking for the safe when it has more value in damage
---
Its fine. Theres no way to prove myself. I will say however that im not terrible but im not pro either.

You need them to distract the enemies, thats why you could make those goals
---
1. Dynamikes skill varies on your trophy range, but dynamike is overall better than barley right now
---
2. Amazing burst potential and can throw iver walls
---
HOWEVER:
---
There are many counters to Dynamike so i dont think a nerf is even necessary. Depending on your trophy range, I say either the enemy Dynamike is really good, or you unluckily cant dodge dynamites.
---
Tip: move in very erratic ways to increase your dodging potential.

Can i get a screenshot of the back of gold mecha bo? I need it for some artüò≠

Hacks üëåüèª

It's still nice piece of work :(
---
If you want to look at it that way when I was a lightweight I‚Äôve beaten many heavyweights asses, easily. This is why I said skill matters more than power level, which is why overall trophies should matter. 
---
I have another account where I got 11 Power level 1 brawlers to 500. At the same time I know people that have maxed brawlers and don‚Äôt have any brawlers to 500.
---
Because of skill level. If you put a team of power level 5 pros against a team of power level noobs, I guarantee the pros win.

Nice effort but 30 gem skin don't need custom animations because they aren't expensive. Superell should rework some 150 skin without custom animations. All 150 gem skins that doesn't have custom animation are a rip-off

Contact supercell at the given email address on the page where you downloaded Brawl Stars.

Why is Clash Royale here? It's better than both rush wars and brawl stars.

Auto op

Half your account is map ideas, take it to r/Brawlmaps
---
Gem grab? what?
---
And very rarely voice changes (Robo Crow/Bo/Dyna)
---
bruh does anybody under 6k realise how hard it is to get brawlers? 4k and a super rare is LUCKY. I got penny at 5k as my first super rare
---
Thanks, bro, you help so much!
---
Clash Royale is Teaming with Rush Wars to delete
---
Brawl Stars
---
oh wow he used the sp glitch so original i bet nobody ever heard of it
---
Graveyard shift has extra novelty because of the skin changes‚Äîit stands out more as it‚Äôs own mode.
---
It's bad if it's with randoms, because those gold snipers are lethal as fuck.  Most people Auto aim the nearest target leaving the gold snipers to pick you off.
---
Oh I see because rush wars is so weak. Rush Wars is the neglected child
---
Tick with Bo's second star power
---
It still works but they nerfed it quite a bit
---
Mortis mortis I have a super

You know I think random will jump to enemies (with El Primoooooo stile XD) on the right so i jump on Piper and that what happend XD. Yeah I have Mecha Crow.
---
my friend is at 6k and his rarest brawler is Rico
---
and another friend at 1k has crow
---
I use tick in robo rumble
---
I woke up in the middle of the night an hour after shop refreshes on the day it came out and immediately spent 3$0 to buy it
---
u/uwutranslator
---
No, it would not. If you auto-aim at a long ranged target, chances are you're going to miss. Besides, the only time you should ever be auto-aiming with Piper is if you have a an enemy right on top of you.

While it is very frustrating to have to deal with players like this, they might have just been lagging.

This is impresive!

This happened to me with Colt but eventually I got it

Dude... lmao

You can literally see him trying to move into the AOE/Shooting us at times. He wasn't lagging. You can  also see him moving in a pattern to avoid the AFK warning.

Make power cubes spawn in the corner so the randoms can be even worse

its kinda dumb that experience, the only thing that truly tracks your accounts age has a cap
---
I agree. The reason why they are called ‚Äúlegendaries‚Äù is because they are really hard to unlock.
---
Idk why they decided to make his mask less colorful...
