He's the only one missing and I have 0.06% to find a new brawler- i believe in my luck *noIdont*

Please criticize as necessary. Also, sorry about the formatting. If it says “Attack”, “Super”, or “Star Powers”, everything under those words is describing that thing.

I think it would be interesting but it would do absolutely nothing to stop teaming, imo thats what we need rn, modifiers that can prevent teaming

I never said getting to rank 20 with power 1 was a big deal, bit the fact that I obtained 200 trophies in 30 minutes is a pure demontration of the amount of times I placed first or second in Showdown. Also, only Solo matches. This game is full of unprepared teammates, and once I was in a team (not showdown) with a level 5 tick with 36 trophies. I was playing as a Penny, SP, 600+. If you want to play 3v3 you must have friends you trust with you. Furthermore, the point you're trying to make with Shelly is valid but only when talking about low level/ low rank matches, and has nothing to do with the Super exploitation that makes her invincible at close range, because of the cycling, the stun etc. etc. Nita and other low trophy road reward brawlers are far less powerful. They're easy to play with but they don't have a 100% win rate at any given circumstance, like Shelly at close range once you know how to spam the super. And think about this. Two or three Shellies together against a big brawler can demolish the HP bar super fast. This braindead, low-risk high-reward is permanent in any environment where close range is achievable for Shelly. Her damage might even be OK, even considering its low spread rate, projectile speed and range... but the other things need imediate actions. Thank you for taking the time to discuss and presenting valid and constructive points.

Nice job lol

How would it work though?
---
rank 20 is extremely easy even with level 1
---
Yeah, it makes me mad when I play with someone who has like 4K trophies when I have 9K.
---
I only have 23 brawlers with 10k trophies
---
Well, he does enough damage to justify a weaker SP
---
Demolition is a very good star power. Be happy with what you got
---
The Pocos are very loyal when it’s the Duo mode in a match of Showdown they will be willing to do anything as long as his partner can be powerful to assert massive domination over the match, Pocos aren’t able to save their partners in time resulting in the partners blaming them instead of themselves for the Pocos are a wonderful species and very powerful in other game modes but he has a limit and that limit is included in this game mode for he is the slowest in the family of BrawlStars but can start quite the fight for being weak for if they can’t save their teammates it was their fault for being an idiot and not sticking together or waiting for the Poco to catch up and wandering off without protection!

ok, this is genius!!
---
Um if it isn’t over i just wanna ask do you brawl tubers ever like make your own programing things?
---
Idk how I get to 9.5k
---
Well supercell put a minimum amount for replays because servers aren't that great rn, not because of this sub.  
---
However, I wouldn't want replays to clog this sub either because some are just basic. But unfortunately I don't think Supercell's gonna do this since players are gonna complain and stuff.

Ohh my goddd. That's amazing! And I'm glad to see you are still making bs skins :)

That’s offsides

What do you mean Leon deserves a lot of respect as he is a skilled brawler who like crow takes a lot of practice to effectively use

Theres nothing original about this post.

Shelly with 700 with band-aid isn't too hard, my only 700 brawler was Jessie because I prefer doing every brawler to 600 than doing stupid overpowered shotgun girl to 700.

The mortis did at the start. But really just passed to the enemy frank

Technically it's Penny. Penny has about 25% more damage but a 30% slower reload. Extra hit, but Penny has half a second of offload.

TL;DR Penny is slower than Poco by something like 0.8 seconds.

Please comment your thoughts

The new Brawler, called Bella( seen a post from the game files about it) is in fact, a ledgendary brawler
---
Wanna play?

That’s true. I resign my case.

It has a different meaning. Why?

I suggest that both bots shouldn't fight each other instead they go straight towards the opposite ikes

I hope you misspelled the word Bear...

Lmao you strugglin with piper
---
Btw im gonna delete all comments that say im liar cuz im not + i checked lwarb beta that guy didnt make any of those skins he just got them from other pepole
---
We already have barley. We don't need anymore useless cards.
---
i have several ideas, it's not really hard to come up with viable alternatives:
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
\-have gene reload all ammo after sucessfully pulling someone with his super
---
\-let genes super deal damage (500 - 1000 ish)
---
\-give him increased reload speed
---
\-instead of 4th shot in a row dealing twice the damage (which would actually be too strong to not take it), give gene 4 ammo slots, so he has a greater burst potential when pulling someone
---
i want star shelly too!!!!
---
True, we already suck in Showdown due to the existance of Shelly.
---
it is stolen lol, we can clearly see the instagram user tag
---
He was only spinning so he could kill the robot and wasn’t teaming with anyone because he wasn’t attacking anyone but the robot.
---
What?
---
Oh. But. I had many and I didn't get dynabetes
---
The only way to remove teaming is removing the free for all gameplay, and that's not gonna happen.
---
Maybe
---
Sure yes
---
oh no legendaries have such a low percentage pls dont be a legendary
---
Yep
---
I have bandita shelly and star shelly lol
---
im shaking haha im literally shaking haha im literally going to kms haha,
---
cool drawing btw

If band-aid wasn't a thing it would've taken me a while longer
---
You got a star power to reck teamers, 3 gems, and token doublers

Hol up. Isn't that just better Gene SP, Worse Brock attack, And just a super taken from Barley though nice art

Didn’t have anything, still made it

Have been sitting on 6k coins for the 5th day in a row myself.

Now, I am Certain that the offering rate for SPs has been significantly decreased, because I would get the same, Singular starpower offered at the shop at Least every other day back when I could only get the One, and now I only get one, Maaaaybe, every 3rd/4th day.  
---
And it won't be one I want either &gt;:(

Yeah so IT WOULD BE EVEN MORE OVERPOWERED

Ahh I remember when Sharpshooters were the last brawlers Id ever touch now me 11k I absolutely adore hitting shots with Colt

He was a no hat

the left one, because it's perfect

Ok which upgrade do you have it

How about fully grown wheat?
---
This would be great for celebrating coc 8 anniversary
---
SHIBA LIBA

Your bear*, nice idea

brawl spelled backwards

I not used wheat, bec. People can see

The problem was Mortis was shooting instead of just walking it in.
---
puta que pariu
---
500th comment what should i do? Guys?
---
I only seen the starpower actually mess me up is using A Shotgunner at long range while trying to run away,Its not enough pepper damage to scare him off

But jessie have shoky

Yes, I've used tall grass on podzol

It should be what the fuck

who cares dude, who cares about internet points, they get you nothing in life

You should've said Indiana Gene

I was gonna say you should have higher expectations than the person above you, but your expectations are way too high lmao
---
No, this has mostly been gem grab. I played double showdown once with another dude without lag though
---
Shelly is the incarnation of auto aim
---
Tbh shelly is one of the worst brawlers without band aid.Everyone wanted a buff now everyone wants a nerf...There are still people who plays shelly without band aid or first star power.
---
EPIC
---
I have them all lmao, and i didnt buy a single one

Dude this is amazing!! Keep it up!!

Then I have *no idea*

OMG this is sooo cool

I amw a women of the night

u/mrinfinity80 I summoned a wild brock

wish there was a brawler with an m1 garand to counter the axis weebs
---
Nice theory you got there.Maybe it will be true someday.
---
Barley because he deals a lot of damage and it is easier to hit your targets rather than dynamike and his starpowers aren't bad (dynamikes starpowers OK too)

Thx

As expected, most people gets their shelly first to 500
---
Super Rare -&gt; Rare -&gt; Epic
---
Is that in order?!?
---
Not funny didn’t laugh
---
You didn't have to post this,there are hundreds of this kind of post and Supercell is aware of this
---
Do you think that's a coincidence?
---
any brawler can hide in cluster of boxes if he isn't facing splash attacks. they can steal boxes from others due to high health but they still can't hurt you due to short range. you need to be experienced enough to realise when a tank can chase you down and how far you should stay away from them.
---
Ahhh dad.... No...... Im just looking at that ant on her dress. Yea😅...
---
Only few shall know

And you have hurt frank's feelings now, he is now with his lose animation
---
I'm shaking
---
Not a man of culture i see... Not nice &gt;:(
---
not op but ok
---
I agree I was stupid to say she needs damage buff.
---
In bounty I always get pipers, Leons and Pennys who throw the game by never checking bushes and fighting even when we are 10 stars ahead. And no I'm not saying this because you have a piper beside your name (I forgot what it's called)
---
If they get only 4 boxes, they just needed to grind more... like me!
---
*NOICEE*

wh.. Who me?  What? No im just thinking about my Thermos bottle. Yea yea

As long as you give credit yeah go ahead

At least they aren't playing Fortnite

Do you think it should be easier to obtain new brawlers. I started playing in the first week of beta and stopped after 5 months. I have continued playing when the game went global and I have been playing it since. I have only 22 brawlers(missing all legy, tara and gene), but my friend at 4000 trophies has all 27. Also I am at 12000 trophies.
---
No, just no.
---
Ayyy ayyy big smoke(rico i mean) . It's me brock. Chill chill.
---
I think it might be rare or super rare cause too many legendaries dilutes the game

Band aid

I guess it's about star power

Me pranked 👌😎🔫
---
currently at 14.6 k (was 11 k before trophy inflation) and i just lose 8 gem grab games in a row playing with randoms, and then like other 4 times playing with randoms in siege. wish i have a team to play with, i guess im just going to be playing duo/solo showdown from now on.
---
Me: 16 brawlers need upgrade  i only have like 200 coins and i need coiled snake and band aid i can also max out my bull and im at 9k
---
And? Im 13k and also 23 brawlers. You are not special.
---
Mortis takes a maximum of 5 seconds to destroy a box at max level
---
I NOW HAVE 400 RICO!
---
Should I just delete this I mean no one likes it and I hate this post aswell
---
 That perfect, curvy body. Those bountiful breasts. The teenager bearing  hips of a literal goddess. It honestly fucking hurts knowing that I'll  never mate with her, pass my genes through her, and have her birth a set  of perfect offspring. I'd do fucking ANYTHING for the chance to get  nita
---
 pregnant. A N Y T H I N G. And the fact that I can't is quite  honestly too much to fucking bear. Why would Supercell create something  so perfect? To fucking tantalize us? Fucking laugh in our faces?!  Honestly guys, I just fucking can't anymore. Fuck.
---
Yeah i mean here about new solo gamemode idea which other person was talking like some continuous respawn deathmatch
---
To catch a predator
---
^
---
Tick was planned to be mythic. You can see that on the second star powers video, the star power's name was red

&gt;!repost!&lt;
---
All you need is them damn walls
---
thanks i was working on it from yesterday and changed the map 3 times before posting it today
---
And that’s why you place the turret in front of you
---
It would.
---
More free progression = less people buying gems/coins to progress
---
Its the game looney toons world of mayhem the game i play
---
Broccoli guy
---
If you don't get the joke, broccoli guy is a villain from skylanders trap team, he laters reappear in skylanders imaginators as a host of troll radio
---
I have star Shelly but I prefer bandita Shelly lol
---
Hong kong
---
\*peeking
---
Dunno what are you going for, but nice.
---
О! Мне очень жаль Я кореец, и сейчас уже более 12 часов. Если вы проверите на следующий день, есть так много комментариев, которые вы не можете проверить. Так чем я могу вам помочь?
---
It’s a little wired but nice😉
---
salut
---
I think its too similar to normal showdown
---
Reminds me of Light Yagami. Great job my dude
---
Chaos in siege.The game will end probably since the first robot.And the devs will balance siege again beacuze the pros will push so fast that can even hit that 35k
---
Everyone choose bo in smash
---
It is supposed to be Bo in a wearing mostly black with red x's on him.  His eye has a x shaped scar in his eye and also a scratch to his cap. His bow is supposed to be a crossbow instead of a regular bow and his mines are x shaped instead of circular. I just didnt execute the idea very well and hope that somebody redoes it to make it look like a skin that could be in game.
---
YOU DIDNT HAVE 400 WHEN YOU PLAYED THAT MATCH! DID YOU!?
---
I always have the same thing in the Star Shop. The retarded bull skin and the light mecha bo
---
One time I played with a Colt, won, and lost only to play with him again. I remember I spawned in a couple games with him. And then I switched modes AND brawler, and saw him again...
---
Instagram normies...
---
Well yes but actually no.
---
I mean... It fits mortis, but I just think it fits Piper better.
---
For sure i would love all models of it. I am sure you did great.
---
That is called band-aid shelly's second star power lol
---
This dude legit has night Mecha crow when I'm over here with only 1300 star points
---
Actually mortis would be op with this star power
---
They only make money though if people who grind that much pay for other things like gold or offers. I still think we need season rewards back but I understand that if they do it will probably be less boxes per season.
---
I wish I got that, all I need is star powers now but I've had none in my shop for the last 3 days
---
The opposite thing has happened to me: I was dragging a red (don’t know wtf it is, I don’t know English very well), but it showed my super
---
**NOW EVERYONES WILL BE 0 TROPHIES AND IS POWER LV 1 AND YOU LOSE YOUR STAR POWERS AND SKINS AND WILL BE THE WORST BRAWLER IN EVERY SINGLE TIER LIST**
---
The 69 is so fitting for this skin too
---
Tysm!🙏
---
Exactly, then you’re both sitting in a lobby feeling obligated to talk to each other.
---
Maybe he pulled crow recently and it’s his lowest brawler. I have 10k Star points with my lowest brawler in the 300s
---
I would have actually bought it too if I hadn’t wasted my gems on token doubler😂
---
At least my star power is better than yours.
---
to everyone saying its unbalanced this is bull not piper, try brocks first starpower on colt and anything is OP.
---
Woah
---
Lol
---
You missed... the perfect chance... to use Brockoli....
---
I got Star Shelly lmao
---
True hahah yeah ive been having mixed feelings abt it.
---
Actually, the first 3 ammo points regenerate 1.5 (if all hit) and the fourth would make 2, giving you AN EXTRA FIFTH HIT, so yeah; broken
---
0.1248 ;(
---
Bug with mortis Then
---
uno reverse card today piper gets snappy snipping which is a star power that brawlstars youtubers say could be better then bandaid
---
No way
---
9k + 7k + 2k players vs 11k + 13k + 11k players
---
You can watch my first DynaJump Guide that I posted a few days ago. Here’s the link!
---
[DynaJump Guide 1](https://redd.it/cni6uu)
---
Konichiwack!
---
Lol also he gpt banned but he said he will return in a month with a new copypasta
---
More like hippie Shelly
---
Well i have 13k and no leggies
---
#stoptextinganddrinving
---
Lol its probably bot 1-5
---
Here is a bad, cuz of throwers they will dominate
---
One trophy, one token and one star token away from prize... lmao
---
I don’t want it to comeback though :(
---
That would be boring to watch. People want to see gameplay, and idk how opening boxes, and the shop has anything to do with making the post more original since it's still the same re used concept. Guess that just reflects that you don't have a problem with the lack of originality and instead generally dislike the post and feel that you have to discredit the hours of work this guy has put into it.
---
Amazing!
---
You’re trash kid lol
---
The idea was to 
---
1) Make the battles int beginning of the match
---
2) Then by "Super" destroy the boxes
---
3) Then finally start beating the safe
---
that would make him op ngl
---
nice
---
Ikr, better then actual football.
---
2 bad we need Christmas spirit u fart
---
They would either have to walk all the way around it, or just use a thrower though
---
Similar to a screeching solo annihilation
---
Yea, but if you bring hmm, maybe Shelly? Than reach the "Super" and destroy the boxes! + Shelly has more dmg than barley, right?
---
Spike could fit in this skin well
---
Next will be mythic then legendary. We still have 3 mythic and legendaries
---
Hes just frustrated hes getting low ass trophy trash randoms i can relate not to the low trophy part tho :/
---
 Yea, but if you bring hmm, maybe Shelly? Than reach the "Super" and destroy the boxes! + Shelly has more dmg than barley, right?
---
I agree , but you are leaving out gene :c
---
May I suggest using the format I use for brawler concepts? I find it easier to follow and find specific stats.
---
Can someone please explain the shaking meme? 
---
I've never been so confused before
---
The oppisite team variant would be intresthing because you choose to protect or attack the heist but still this looks cool
---
Mortis with snappy sniping would be OP.
---
The only downside is that before the super, you would have to walk all the way to the enemy respawn area, where they have the most control
---
Wrong! It’s 11:55 here buster!
---
hmm, okay, I agree :P
---
Where is *insert a brawler whitc didn't exsist when you made it* downvote!
---
No, you have another way, open your eyes
---
?
---
How did you not use ammo?
---
Hi...oh his head fell off...
---
Okay guys, I understood, that it was bad idea, so I will make another my idea for Heist map :P
---
But it requires skill to get close to someone
---
They got us in the first half not gonna lie
---
Girls: oh my god he’s so hot I want his sperm
---
Oh f\*ck, I forgot about this, thank you!
---
when i play really bad i just wait for everyone to exit or wait for the 10 secs to pass so people think i was afk during the match lmaoo
---
Also pams backpack looks like a face
---
Baaaaaadddd
---
There ya go
---
Try 13k if you hit every single blade of the ult
---
Bye
---
Is it Light Yagami ?
---
Thank you sooo much. I’m totally in love with your art too!!!
---
Its not a bug its just someone bringing in they’re teammate who had lower trophies then them
---
Invisible turret shooting them
---
SALL
---
bull turned to shelly
---
I swear if this doesn't get more than 3 up votes this time lmao.
---
Great concept, op. Keep good work! :)
---
1977 trophies ha ha ha, hard work, I've been playing since global release 1 - 2 hours a day, that's hard work and a lot of people did even more
---
But there was a sale on summer Jessie and summer Brock for 39 gems each. I have both of them now
---
Love this! BUT PUT THE HAT ON THE MORTIS IN THE BACKGROUND
---
Well, apparently so!
---
I think that new brawler is going to be Mythic because Supecell should make 4th mythic and then 4th legendary
---
Don’t you mean 11?
---
Np my dude
---
They do. You've got one coming up in 23 trophies. Keep up the good work :)
---
You are right my friend.
---
You know who he is right?
---
He didn't say he smiled tho
---
MaDe wITh MEmEaTiC
---
Barlock.
---
yEs
---
Omg sorry I actually happen to like top hat mortis more but I forgot. Sorry
---
Hi
---
Oof
---
Petition seen ;)
---
Wait what if you team with the enemy to take down the team with 20 power ups?
---
Of Course!! XD
---
I'm upvoting. But I wouldn't buy it because it looks like a promotion for the Dora movie. And things like the Dora movie shouldn't exist let alone be promoted.
---
You just have to press and release to fire, that's done quickly by tapping, meanwhile you don't have to drag to aim, that's why it automatically aims for you
---
it's not a glitch. it's how her attack works
---
It WAS 1 trophy
---
Two games in different genres made by the same developer can still coexist. Also, Clash Royale isn't dead, not by a long shot
---
Make Leon take off Nitas hoodie next
---
I’m want the picture is a glitch
---
XD LMAO
---
Respects for the primo on the enemy team. Well done.
---
the picture is drawn i'm pretty sure
---
The new Starpower somehow doesn't work in practicemode by me.
---
Well but there's a small issue, Frank isn't a trophy road brawler...
---
Sinced you threatened me now I want to do more. Thanks. XD
---
Repost fucking dumbass and fuck ur post don’t ever post again
---
I just imagine Mortis with a high pitched voiced saying^i am a creature of the night!  
---
Cute art!
---
Great job! Kinda reminds me of the Dragon Quest Builders standard outifit
---
Don't bully my furry girl Nita :&lt;
---
Lol i have like 370 regular box
---
Wholesome
---
Make this in jojo style
---
Is it weird that i hear persona music to?
---
Lol it would actually be lot of fun
---
Hoiii ;&gt;
---
r/brockgang unite!
---
I'm shaking.. I'm fucking shaking, guys. This art style is truly amazing. Gotta love this series
---
Yes this is high skilled gameplay. 2 bulls getting ready to spam aa
---
You can’t call someone an asshole when you called him fucking retarted
---
This need more up votes
---
I think it said Christmas 2018 skin
---
"I might be evil, but I still have PRIDE"
---
B**ch lasagna
---
That looks pretty awesome!
---
Marry him.
---
Hola soy Shelly!
---
What have you brought upon this cursed land?
---
I'm getting close with Jessie too. Good character.
---
No thank you for bringing the best brawl stars “garbage” content.
---
Oh no it’s you again
---
I feel like I get mostly boxes
---
I'm not asking its just people seem to hate what people accomplish and my power 1 crow is just gonna trigger people so no point in positivity
---
Right? In solo showdown I can understand, but in duo is just pure dumbness, at an point you can have an invincible brawler spawn right next to you.
---
If its fake then who made the drawing
---
I need this bootleg peace of art
---
goosebumps
---
Bock
---
I get them like 4/7 days a week. Guess I’m lucky. Oh wait never mind still have no legendaries
---
idk
---
You are, you posted it 6 times, i will not be added because a lot of stats and details are missing and it’s just nita mixed with rosa
---
What sucks is that spike gained trophies and tokens
---
Now we gotta treat her like she has 6 ammo slots
---
as long as he's having fun, i won't call it a waste of time and energy. and, he's not gonna stop anytime soon, he was in the hospital.
---
It will not*
---
i actually send it look at my profile
---
You stupid he meant he was 1 trophy away (8149) 
---
To getting the next milestone. Your blind, look at the darker orange. Go see a doctor.
---
Yup burn the teamers
---
Why did you assume that we all hate supercell?
---
why does that sound like some badass anime intro lol
---
Love it! If u made this into a series I would read it. Just sayin
---
You did your math wrong
---
Ok DAMN BRO like I can barely handle him as he is and you had to go out of your way to make this monstrosity?
---
It's a good effort bud :)
---
am I the only one who thinks Star shelly is better than bandita
---
Its a 2018 skin, you played in 2018, you got it
---
That’s even more ridiculous. No need to give the tank killer the health of a tank
---
It's actually not mine and yes he can be annoying AF but gotta say he thicc
---
Why tf your video in portrait but ur game in landscape this hurts. Downvote
---
Wtf you are not making any sense mortis has nothing to do with this
---
Anyone just use normal Shelly? Because I do 🤷‍♂️
---
F for broken chain.
---
Uh oh. Guys. He’s fucking shaking.
---
no.
---
you turn around and look up
---
I play Piper in Friendly Practice.  (Bots, heist, kaboom canyon. 
---
Get your super and jump over to top right corner and simply just wail away (corner is max range)
---
So OP. Especially because it doesn't matter at what range you hit, you still get half an ammo.
---
You called him a power cube haha that was funny epic 😎😎😎😎virginity rocks!
---

---
okay but should i repost the map
---
My fellow brethren got the star player though ;)
---
but in the videos it said he was a robot :|
---
also they said colt had shotgun or something but ur correct
---
Everyone in this comment section being amazed, me: “uhhh, yeah”
---
They don’t care their ultimate goal is to make money
---
Up to you. If you think my suggestion shouldn't be added. Let it like that.
---
It’s Reddit. 
---
We don’t do that here.
---
Jaiden animation
---
I kill lots of shellys as Morris.... And as penny but hey were not talkomg about me here....
---
The best brawler.
---
okay thanks
---
Well I have only Shell Shock.... so yeah I'm automatically cool
---
Really?
---
When ur dyna is lvl 6...
---
Why not
---
If you can’t land two hits on a Colt without getting killed, then you’re probably just bad at using Mortis.
---
Lol I was actually thinking about saying that. Also r/forgottoswitchaccounts ?
---
I don't see why unlocking everything would stop me from playing brawl stars altogether.  
---
 Unlocking every star power just means that I would have a Huge variety in options, and I'd be able to experiment all the more.  
---
And besides that, BS is being updated frequently with new brawlers and maps. So anything i earn beyond maxing out my account Currently does Not go to waste, but is being stockpiled for use later on.
---
Nah he’s just tooting his own horn
---
The Mortis gang is going after me, help me!
---
Very good
---
Yeah I didn’t. I grinned ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
I don't think you're able to, unless the dev team or a YouTuber has pictures. We can really only take the dev's word for it.
---
That's not a bull. A true bull would sit in bushes til second place
---
