How about gaining double the amount you lost by doubling your spin rate

What a tip bro thxüòÇ

I got Leon from one of those blue ones

Darryl rolling is just him spinning sideqays

Honestly looks like he comes from a nursery rhyme on youtube

No prob any time

does 3/4 of damage to enemies and then heals himself and teammates and then kills the rest of your team is semi broken

RYAN!!!

*oh yes jessie squeeze harder*

Love this idea

Oppening

it's cool, when my friend and I want to play 1 vs 1 we have to kill bots to play normally
---
POCOS STAR POWER SHOULD BE REGULAR POCO. NEW STAR POWER MAKE HIM HEAL HIMSELF BY X AMOUNT WHENEVER HE ATTACKS
---
Yes

Might just be me but by the time your hopping away for grenades to be dropped and have a chance at hitting, youre already dead

Why
---
That is why I want you to downvote this
---
Sabotage?
---
Don't catch you slippin' now (x2)
---
It is an effective strategy tho.
---
I know, stop giving legendary brawlers to people who don t have 3K trophies yet and instead give to 10K players who don't have a legendary yet
---
It looks pretty fun actually
---
Smash?
---
Even piper is actually good here
---
Wait, you guys are winning siege?

Oops I looked at the number 7 and didn't noticed the face

yeah but if you are low on health in for example the stage 3 bossfight, just go behind the wall and she heals
---
I was like that‚Äôs the reason I‚Äôm gonna kill you
---
Everyone will rush mid with...nasty concequences
---
Easy kill on everyone cause I was going ham
---
I am sorry, did a mistake. I have fixed the picture but I can't edit this post anymore. Next time I will do it better
---
I feel that
---
I‚Äôm the small percent that‚Äôs good at it......
---
The best is when you‚Äôre missing 3 brawlers but have the rest of them maxed so all you get are coins
---
Actually i kinda like siege
---
Do you have unlimited data? Brawl Stars works better with service.
---
How do you practice with bots? I‚Äôm fairly new to the game
---
For comparison to when she first got introduced, her super time has been halved, damage reduction decreased by 12%, damage reduced by 9%, and hits to get her super increased 21%. That is a lot. The only one who can even compare to her is leon who had more nerfs, yes. But each were significantly less, and some even gave him a tiny buff, but Rosa has been bombarded with nerfs, so now she has an average win rate of 48% which makes her below average.
---
Sorry, I have fixed the picture, but it is not possible to edit the post. Should I make a new post?
---
I saw the same exact post like a month ago
---
3v3 is the core of brawl stars, so if he's balanced there i believe that's good.
---
That's an average of just under 580. Seems like 13000 would be the "achievement" level.
---
I do, service isn‚Äôt always fantastic where I live but I‚Äôll try it out üëçüèª
---
That would be a good game mode but I think it should be a special event ( in my opinion )
---
This is great! But my opinion doesn't count cause I'm a useless mistake.
---
Interesting
---
I don't get all the hate siege gets its a fun unique game mode. Yea there's potential to go on massive streaks and sometimes you can lose a lot of trophies but that also means it can go the other way too. I think if you're only argument against it is that you lose more than you'd like you shouldn't bash the mode and start looking to become better in that mode. It's not like siege is magically harder for any of us we all have to deal with bad randoms and different game mechanics.
---
F
---
My apologise, did a mistake. I have fixed the picture, but can't edit this post anymore. Next time I will do it better :)))
---
This is so sad. Alexa, play despacito
---
Make sure to use lower Brawlers if you're not totally sure about your service - don't want a -7!
---
You are right, next time will do it better
---
You just press the "Create" (Aka Friendly game) button where you can select any map and mode in the game. If you wanna play with some friends just press the Invite button and that's about it
---
Yes it is idk fun day friday???
---
Yeah
---
Fair enough, can‚Äôt tell ya how many times I‚Äôve dcd while pushing my colt over 7-800 trophies.. it‚Äôs the worst feeling
---
New brawler every update? Please no. This will never let legendaries to show up in our collections

I don't know i don't have brawler with 500 trophies. üòÖ

actually, I think that poco is kinda op in 3v3 game modes, his range is outstanding, his damage is not to shabby and he can heal quickly with the amount of charge his damage does to his super + his star power

Now this is how u truly rocket jump

Awesome I would prefer vs the same brawler however comes down to skill

Not if you can dodge em, 1v1 me
---
nah he should throw a bottle of piss that‚Äôs an aoe poison and slows them down
---
Some brawlers are counters to anothers so... This is stupid
---
Hey Gedi. Just wanted to know what you did to make these full of color and perfectly without paper in the final projects. I would like to try it out because I try to make ideas sometimes but nobody likes to read posts and only look at art and clips (because 75% of Reddit is picture book reading children based on my experience).
---
It works everytime for me. Before carl came out I played every day and got every token I could and never got a legendary. Then after I heard carl was comin out, I saved every box I could, if i remember it was around 65 normal boxes and 15 star boxes. Then I unlocked carl and spike after opening them all. So I decided save until Rosa came out. when she did i opened around 25 boxes for my 10th one to give me Rosa. Then i slowed down at playing the game, but i saved up to 17 boxes (no star box) and got bibi like on my last open.
---
I think this games box system is (secretly) like royales chest system. Cause in royale, everytime i take a break, my next chest gives me a legendary.
---
i think at least 2 would be good.
---
Say that you hold no rights, do supercell can use it

Can confirm.

2 pipers on a team can be scary if you both know how to use her

But poco is op

Spike **did** have a voice in a trailer , *back in my days , there were trailers with brawlers, yeah..*
---
Seriously though as Frank said Spike will NEVER get a voice

I gonna do a lot of things later ;).

I liked Shiba Nita :)

Oh ok then. Maybe i will try. Thanks
---
You're welcome!
---
No don't destroy Leon secret blushing on something face
---
Well, if I remake it I could get more viewers. There's only 7 atm
---
Remember the ''We need to talk'' video? when they made the community scared that the game will get killed, (OG's will remember that photo Supercell gave on the news ingame)  they unlisted **Every single video**  on their channel, they removed everything on social media, and the rest is history im too lazy to explain
---
Pretty sure you can‚Äôt get negatives on posts lol
---
Who cares about Penny's turret when you got a sicko mode Poco.
---
Kind of meaningless without seeing the other brawlers. If both sides have a new player, it's fair.
---
That would be OP in gem grab and siege, like how Barley(lvl10) is almost unkillable in Siege, maybe add a debuff to enemies on his ult or increase the healing.
---
False, I was once number one crow US with 713.
---
Very good!
---
That seriously their first name? (Don't answer that) cause if it is, that's a no no my friend

Get prepared for the nerf LOL

*ring, ring, ring* 'uh, hello' "yes, supercell HQ, I would like to inform you we have a hacker on the loose"

Would you listen to someone who named themselves after a game that they *don't like*
---
To all people saying he is balanced:
---
How can a brawler who is okay in two modes and unplayable in any other mode be balanced?
---
Oh the irony
---
I have done that countless times and once I get bored of that brawler I instantly regret it lol. The problem is that the gold is hard to get.
---
Offer. Not discount. Offer makes complete sense. They‚Äôre offering you a skin for 80 gems.
---
xD
---
Is it just me, or *sniff* do I smell *sniff sniff* a slight scent of *sniff* bull?
---
The hatless Poco makes me very uncomfortable
---
I play poco solely in gem grab, and man does he rocks. 
---
With how his attack range and spread you charge super so fast it‚Äôs crazy. 
---
I agree that he is the embodiment of a 1 game mode brawlers but he truly ace that one
---
Your right... It is about the skin...
---
When the person says fortnite is better than bs then you know he/she is stupid

Let's go get em

Well people who played for 2 years got an exclusive shelly skin soooooooooooooo

This is only a boss fight thing, it starts and ends on the weekdays. Robo rumble and big game will stay the same though, will start on weekend and ends Monday.

?..

This will actually be really cool! I love the idea of having skins animated in a way like this.
---
Dynamike with starpower :p
---
Wack
---
Clever idea!
---
ouch rosa is vegetable meat
---
Name checks out
---
Don't worry I don't do that this often. And I try to stay polite most of the time, except when the person I'm playing with is REALLY bad.
---
For instance, the Bull I was talking about was at 11k trophies. At this point I wondered if he just wasn't doing this on purpose.
---
Wow, Im a sub
---
Good for you
---
*zooms in*
---
Personally, I think reload buffs r the way to go with mortis instead, as it increases mobility and damage output.
---
Nice wallpaper lmao
---
Yeah no. When you are matched with an El Primo who charges the boss and a Jessie who doesn‚Äôt place her turret it isn‚Äôt fun
---
Yeah and it makes sense since Leon is a chameleon
---
So according to you, Japanese = anime 100%. Ooooh I see.
---
Well, what about Hot Maze?

So first art stealing, now map stealing? Dude, you didn‚Äôt even try to crop out the watermark. This is a whole new level of scummy.

I did as well, please report it

I had same situation like 2 months and I dont know the solution

It‚Äôs ok I got my first one like a two week ago, I played since beta so about two years now almost, got 11k and lvl 146, I almost gave up too don‚Äôt worry I‚Äôm with you

---
Lenny* (?)
---
Not just stupid, but retarded
---
I use the on
---
Would be cool if it‚Äôs a 5v5 with a very long map.
---
why the hell would i play fortshite
---
the real question is, did you get the star token?
---
Your preference tbh
---
What Leon format?
---
That is correct. As for the rabbit, I'm guessing it should have between 200 and 300 dps.
---
My ideal buff for Poco would be a speed and reload speed buff.
---
Well, it's not. üòÇ Pocco doesn't even sound like a Finnish name.
---
Well you see his teleport isn't instant, he has to wait for his hat to stop moving before he gets teleported. Also, unlike Bull, his Super won't allow him to go through walls.
---
It is not.
---
I was talking about 1 tile gaps between walls. It's pretty hard to go through them and can be frustrating to not catch up to the enemy because of them. Anyways good map.
---
HUDAAAAHUDAAA
---
You‚Äôre dumb lol
---
Great my brain stops working again
---
He was just trying to get close to them, he did nothing wrong
---
I only associate Dyna flairs with teaming.  Dynamite iidnt very fun to play, not very good, and is only very good when you team.  Barley is actually a very fun brawler in my eyes, and mostly good outside of SD
---
we talkin about the character or the grain now?
---
This sounds like a bunch of excuses honestly. There might not be power cubes, there might be as well, we don't know because the mode doesn't exist yet. The point still stands you said something couldn't happen and I showed you proof that it could. If you think your Bill could beat Rey's Mortis, good luck. Just know I'm putting my money on Rey...
---
Kids? So you just assume im a kid because you don't agree? Dude you're a broken record.
---
Shiba Nita was me of my other favorites
---
##JESS CAN'T FIX YOU
---
Lol
---
I smell LOTS of pennies
---
The lazy eye and beard pushed me to buy it.
---
It would be good with a different format.  This format is made to have a plot twist at the end.  For example:
---
**Me:** *kills Pam*
---
**Everyone else at Dunder Mifflin:**
---
(Tom's Face)
---
In SD, definitely, I think Rey would have the upper hand, but in a 1v1, where Mortis can't pre-charge his ult nor cover himself, he's pretty much death, Mortis takes 5 hits to kill a bull while bull only needs about 2 full shots (which he's gonna be landing because of how Mortis attacks)
---
Hi my name is Joe I am 16 I sleep at my bed

Yeah but imagine taking Jessie, but you are matched up against a barley, which is √† counter to Jessie. You loose, and you take mortis in case there is a barley, mortis being a counter to barley. But you get matched up against a Rosa. Mortis stands no chance against Rosa. See what I mean ??

This certainly has more thought put into it than a lot of others I‚Äôve seen. Also I like the idea of the healing star power. That would make Golem sort of like a Paladin, which would be cool. I‚Äôd love to see something like this made into an official brawler. Good job!

Well according to me, skins do not provide any advantage in battle but most of the limited time skins will be on the battle pass and free to play players knkw that we can easily beat a star shelly or pheonix crow. Thanks for understanding

Try triple tanks. That got me to insane 3

ok my bad sorry

How did you misspell it twice?

Carl gonna use to crack stones lol

I actually got Crow as my 12th Brawler on the 5th week playing. I haven't got any other legendaries since. I want Spike thoughhhh.

Spy is better. He has and revolver and can disguise. Also different ways to be invisible cough dead ringer.

Insane 1
---
Hey Gedi have you a Youtube channel or something that i can learn from you? I want to start making my own skins but i dont know how to start
---
I think Supercell patches it.
---
It seems like you work with Brawl-Mart making skins to sell there (spotted that dinosaur darryl)
---
No
---
Worst part is that I would spend money on this game to get Gene Mortis Crow and Leon but it‚Äôs so overpriced. It sorta makes sense 5 bucks for a epic 10 for a mythic and 20 for a legendary but it‚Äôs so expensive
---
Elaborate?
---
At first I agreed with you but after seeing this same comment over and over from you I just realized you really don‚Äôt care

I think Supercell patched it.

I know you dont have an advantage, but if there's a skin you really like in the battle pass, but you cant buy the battle pass, thats not very fair. I hope you get what I mean.
---
Hi!
---
Thank you!
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure you can buy the skin at any time and the 80 gems offer isn‚Äôt a discount, so you don‚Äôt have to rush to get it.
---
Bibi with star power gonna Yeet
---
Were the saves damaged at all?
---
No he ate the entire Rainbow
---
THANKA YOU!
---
That would be way cooler. Maybe there's like a "hiding phase" and you can hide your flag anywhere on your half of the map in grass or something.
---
r/nerfcrow

Idk. It was fun but they ruined it with too many map changes
---
Who cares you know what the word is
---
He is left, but the picture is only in preview here
---
My first thought was death note, I'm stupid.
---
I wish they actually sold Brawl Stars figures
---
Ballbreaker Rico XD
---
Lmao
---
For a quick reminder: just use either Colt, Leon, Pam, Bull, or Primo. Make others' life easier.
---
I‚Äôm not complaining of Poco being not in the picture, I‚Äôm complaining about him being misspelled by the game lead (Frank) 
---
Try to understand posts before insulting
---
Mispell

JUST JUMP UP KICK BACK WHIP AROUND AND SPIN AND WE JUMP BACK DO IT AGAIN
---
I love this idea.

I meant reptile

What other advise do you have for him and Carl ( I also need advise to push him)
---
Hey darryl roll on that water
---
Underrated
---
Likevote for more

well, eh.

but it was
---
Don't be sad.It have just happend for everyone
---
imo after the 4th season(the one with the tornament) the show got repetitive. It was still good but the stories became predictable

*ey*
---
There a subreddit for stuff like this, r/brawlstarsp
---
Sorry, i don't speak froggy legs
---
Hard carry
---
Nice
---
I don‚Äôt have anything else for mortis, but for Carl,   My best advice is to use walls to your advantage. Try to trap people in closed areas so you can get your pickaxe back quicker and deal tons more damage. Also, with your super, only go when your health is really high. Lots of players dive in with 1/2 hp and end up getting themselves killed without doing much. Hope this helps!
---
You should have upgraded shelly and colt to lvl 9 before you opened the boxes so you could get star powers
---
I like the idea but what is if they added a color change option so you could change the buttons, the hood l, the pocket, and Stripe.
---
Artist be like:
---
Thanks a lot
---
How much does it cost?
---
You sure rosa is a dude?
---
There clearly is a Bibi behind him. You can‚Äòt trick me, fool!
---
No color, so it doesn't count xd
---
~~back when Rico was actually a good brawler &amp; wasnt **T H I C C**~~
---
It's not p2w. People get level 1 trophy road brawlers to  500 trophies.
---
Haha geology bats!
---
How does no one understands these kind of words style means sarcasm?
---
He was being sarcastic.
---
One of the tickets...

Death by lolipop

Which one

No it pierced the other way

Stfu and take my karma
---
No.
---
Mortis needs an **INDIRECT** buff, not a Direct buff.
---
By buffing Dynamike and perhaps nerfing like Brock/buffing Piper, Mortis will become better. Specially in Bounty which is honestly his best mode imo
---
A mouthwatering death
---
This isn't a bug. Replies are available if there's at least one player that has &gt;=400 trophies in a match.
---
I've suffered it multiple times, auto-moderators must be stopped.
---
for sure they have to add it, its amazing
---
Pride Leon.
---
Wrong flair
---
What do you suggest? I couldnt decide on a flair.
---
Same this shit sucks right
---
Humor
---
I can call my female friends dudes, and they call me back like such the same way. Yeah, pretty sure dude works bothways rn
---
B A K A, I'd sit in a bush with my super ready to roll onto you and make TEAMING no more.
---
Changed it

I see you are forrom romania arent cha

I don‚Äôt upvote karma-farmers/karma-beggers.
---
It‚Äôs some bogus shit
---
Yeah, the 2 Oni seasons were great
---
I can second this. I too used to think that leon was critical, but managed to beat the level much easier with Pam.
---
Not exactly begging. If you don't wanna make the mods rethink then go ahead.
---
What happened then? What do you mean by: taking down a meme?
---
It isn't automod. It's a new moderator who got rather trigger happy
---
Impossible
---
It is no longer on brawl stars subreddit
---
No u. Toxic kid lmao
---
Lol right
---
I see the a lot, but I don‚Äôt think it will be fixed anytime soon.
---
At least you got some power points... I guess...
---
However, your legendary chance will have increased dramatically. I hope you have better luck opening boxes in the future!
---
I am really hoping that it‚Äôs not a minion that picking him up
---
It makes sense and I even have proof. I can screenshot it any time you want.
---
Carl: How much would this be?
---
that was supposed to be joke
---
besides, isn't that thread just to shit on others? why don't they just make interesting content and discussions themselves on this thread?
---
Oh god is AMAZING!
---
If the cross barrels weren't in the middle it would be a good map. 
---
Oh wait, it's Siege nevermind. Nothing can make it better lol.
---
No idea but it‚Äôs a new design ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
There should be this kind of skin for every brawler and you unlock them at 11k tr maybe
---
The do I fact more than other brawlers
---
This happens when you upgrade a brawler while that brawler is in the lobby
---
Thanks for telling me
---
For the love of god actually use your tickets
---
yay this got featured on meme review thanks guys
---
Even his name is Toxic.... 
---
But for real, sorry about your loss.
---
Ha! Actually I already tried to make such skin. But I like your too!!!
---
Aww, how cute
---
Oooh I love this. It's a lot like hot maze too which is gone now. Upvote from me. Mind if I repost and give you credit? I'd love having this in-game.
---
Funny pun
---
#&lt;3
---
You need someone with speed and range to dodge rockets and keep the shooter bots away from your tanks. Jessie isn‚Äôt a great choice. Colt with his star or Leon in her place and you have a solid comp.
---
Your post has been removed, make sure to use the body of a post to elaborate on the title.
---
Someone has actually done this before
---
Black, just like his old design.
---
Huh, that is a good strategy... Nice...
---
Also, all new map ideas should be posted in the r/Brawlmaps subreddit. Thanks.
---
Almost loss
---
*Report
---
Light mode
---
Congrats
---
It's not the rockets that get me, it's the sweeping wave of lasers.  Jessie and Leon have the same HP and Colt has less, so he will always go down in one sweep if I'm anywhere within 180 degrees of his front when he decides to do the move.
---
Bull and Primo can use their special to dodge, but what are y'all doing to get past this? It feels broken and impossible.
---
Damn dude see you on the front page this is epic!
---
You gotta type more than a title buddy
---
Couldn't, Agree More.
---
Go to the home page of the subreddit, three dots top corner and change user falir
---
Would he shoot nuts?
---
Sorry, because this essentially defeats the whole purpose of the map but 1 block spaces are very hard for brawlers to get through and they are not on any in game maps. Thank you!
---
Brawl stars needs to copy Fortnite skins lmao
---
Thanks for the replies, guys. I've certainly seen my share of reamers(almost always throwers) and I'd hate to get lumped in with that lot.
---
Also, please post all maps in r/Brawlmaps subreddit.
