I haven't been playing Brawl Stars for very long, about a month

Honestly they aren't even skins. They are just art that would never fit in a game. Obviously his earlier one were awesome but recently it's not even skins anymore.

Everyone

Why did you go after the el primo? They weren't teaming
---
Super rares are only easy to get if you have the means for acquiring them; that means either gems (to buy the offer) or boxes to open. 
---
Even at 60 boxes, you‚Äôre looking at close to a 50/50 chance of getting him versus not getting him.

Hello, I have a question about de power ups, the actual green power boxes  give us life and damage, my ask is will you put other kind of power ups like movement speed, attack speed or only life or something else?

There's no need to deny that most of the upvotes come from redditors licking gedi's shoes. He created some great concepts at first but now I feel he's just playing off the fact that people will upvote him no matter what he posts
---
Why is it so hard to get a legendary brawlers without having to spend any money
---
Impressive results 
---
Amazing and ransoms used in the same sentence? Uhh
---
I personally like playing on cavern churn, rico's pretty amazing on it despite the prominence of close range brawlers
---
My only criticism is some one of the skins don‚Äôt look like it belongs to the character he is designing it for (example: Veteran Colt) but then again supercell made Night witch Mortis and it doesn‚Äôt even look that much like mortis. It‚Äôs kinda hard to explain but you get the idea

Probably a Leon main from the fact that he mindlessly rushes into his enemies and expects them to melt before him

So tru tho

how would you stop this?

I love the idea but in actuality it's not good. I mean no harm toward the creator but for the state of the game it just doesn't work. If they could fix some of it's problems I would be happy to keep it in the game. 
---
Truly a legend
---
Yup
---
They are really smart. That colt used his bubble to eat up all the lasers.
---
But Bo is power lvl2?
---
Yeah basically, I just find it weird that its always Jessie who is the weak link ( not saying I am an expert or anything, its just that I would never run straight into a bull on purpose lol).

Really? Thats the best way i knew on how to fix it, sorry chief, your on your own.

[removed]
---
That makes no sense
---
Well now it makes sense...
---
Dude you killed everyone else in the game. That‚Äôs honestly incredible. 
---
They changed them because of carl and the way he works
---
The sub has been stagnant for a while, it ain't Gedi-Kor (and the other artists) fault.
---
It's all Buff Crow, Bush Bulls, El Primo 10 gem jumps, Etc.
---
Fbi open up!... Wait you a police?
---
He is talking about 1.5 and 1.4 is like 99/100 so almost no difference. 14x100/15 =~ 0.9
---
What are your trophies? I'm at 6k+ and it's absolute cancer to play with randoms. I either lose or win as the star player (I know it does not mean much, but gives a good idea. And no, that does not mean I'm super good, only that the randoms are awful, and you can clearly see on their retarded decisions during the game). Yet when I play with my club or friends I always go on a winning spree. Obviously a planed team comp makes a big difference, but it always surprises me how 6k randoms make such bad plays.
---
A good example is brawl ball, so much fun to play with friends and club, because they pass the ball, position well and help each other like anyone with a brain. Then you go on with randoms and you get a primo that does not pass the ball even if 3 enemies are on him and you are totally alone on his range (they don't even pass the ball to the enemy and try to hit them, they just run with it, die in 2 seconds, and try again). A Darryl missing his ult by a mile and letting the enemy all alone with the goal open. The Bull seeing everyone getting away from the Frank while he is using super but he decides to keep going in Frank's direction because... I don't know. The Frank on your team using super to destroy your goal cover to get 1 low hp guy when he is all alone and your whole team is right there...
---
Everyone does something stupid once in a while, it happens. But there is a curse in this game where randoms will use all their repertoire of dumb plays whenever they get matched with you. It's just how it is.
---
normie meme
---
As do I
---
For me it‚Äôs genes, the ones on my team are ass. They always miss their super and barely hit any shots whatsoever.
---
Crow       Supercell        Please       Date

I know it a joke, but Carl is a super rare

Just clay! haha XD Thanks a lot!!
---
1.) Crow got a small buff, doesn't mean he's never getting another one
---
2.) Bo will get a remodel
---
3.) GEDI-KOR's skins are amazing and he has been noticed by the team, but he can't be a 3d artist. This doesn't mean there's no way his skins are getting in the game, ryan said in a brawl talk they used some community ideas
---
4.)There's different kinds of teaming. I know it's annoying. But deal with it. New strats come around.
---
Cuz you level up 2 times. It‚Äôs a glitch, it should‚Äôve been 40 but supercell haven‚Äôt fixed this yet. Before seize it was impossible to rank up 2 times in one game. 
---
Hope they fix this. 
---
Thank you very much :D
---
Thank you so much!!
---
Most showdown maps favor high DPS characters who can kill crates with the fewest number of shots. Characters like Shelly and Bull.
---
Most people aren't at 550 trophies though. My highest is barely 300
---
Not Cavern Churn. That's just teamers vs bush campers.
---
U know what I mean
---
Darryl's shooting the Battle Log, Leaderboards, and News
---
Invincibility won't take you far past the exit and the enemy knows there is only one exit they need to focus fire on, so it's not like it will be a surprise when someone comes out.
---
Dont know how it happened 
---
Says the guy with 4000 trophies 
---
Yeah, but if we want to balance brawlers, it better to look at how good this brawler is at 500+ trophy range. Because at 500+ trophy range, it shows how good a brawler actually is. Frank isn't strong tbh, el Primo is better than Frank overall
---
Nice man 
---
I have 0 legendary brawlers, but I have every other brawler  :)
---
üò±your right
---
Yeah, I feel like all the maps that get shit on favor shotgunners but the maps that favor range brawlers are loved. I think the issue is that people think every brawler should work on ever showdown map which is definitely not the case with most maps.
---
I bet she only shoots at brocks
---
People who gets killed by Rico or throwers outside the bush and they are scared to go inside the bush are whining about how shite the map is. I like cavern churn and I don‚Äôt use bull or Shelly. I use rico. Best map for rico 
---
Primo took all the power cubes and booked whenever in danger. We kept dying to get boss to lock on while invincible and do as much damage as possible. Colt does a ton of dps, shelly does less, but can startle, and primo does most, but very little range.
---
U should've just auto aimed and then the Smelly would've been dead
---
Everything everywhere has been suggested already, we don‚Äôt have the capabilities to see back in time 50 years so we might as well post our ideas if we haven‚Äôt seen them recently.
---
Impossible, maybe something like that. I created it yesterday
---
I JUST OPENED ANOTHER ONE!!! I NEED A CONFIRMATION SCREEN!!!
---
Imagine a pekka Darryl with super rushing towards you
---
Frank tho
---
Thanks, it's really satisfying! I always try to do my best.
---
I admit that King Frank was perfect!
---
Actually not really
---
This is so accurate that it scares me
---
I feel bad for you man. I‚Äôm at 4.3K and I thought it was unfair that I only have 15/23. 
---
Mythic odds are 0.2496%, so you had a 29% chance of getting one, so it's completely normal. Legendary odds go up the longer you don't get a brawler but then they reset, but lets assume you had a 0.012% chance. With 135 boxes, you had a 15% chance of pulling a leggy, so the odds still weren't in your favor. If you want to calculate the exact odds, go to [https://dskjal.com/statistics/chance-calculator.html#general](https://dskjal.com/statistics/chance-calculator.html#general) and plug in your exact value and number of boxes. Hope thid helps!
---
I say that because most of the token doublers are just 200
---
so like a duo showdown like mechanic
---
Two things happen at the end of a season
---
1. Brawlers above 500 get trophies it in half like if you have a brawler 508 he would go down to 504.
---
2. Under some trophy road rewards(1000‚Äôs and 500‚Äôs) you get more tokens the farther you go on the road. When the timer runs out you collect the tokens that it shows.
---
Hope this helped 
---
wanna team with me ? I play solo too
---
nice
---
These two are the worst maps in the game ans should have never been added. On the bright side though, since we got them both in a row we won't have them on friday when carl comes out, so it'll be easier to push him. It was annoying having gene come out and seeing cavern churn as the SD map at the time.
---
I‚Äôm loving Cavern Churn because it‚Äôs the  only map I can push my Shelly, Bull and Rico. 
---
I can't decide if this is sloppy rounding or just bad math, but if those probabilities came from multiplying 135 boxes by 1/1000 chance, that's not how you do it. See my other comment on this post for the real math :)
---
Facts don't care about your feelings
---
No I just want to know more than "1 person is watching you. Is it a friend? Someone else? A developer? Who knows?"
---
Then don‚Äôt go into the bush in the middle. When I play as bull or Shelly I stay away from the middle until the very end and I usually get 2-4th. 
---
Bo being op? What. You must be 3K-5K. Dude you wont see a single Bo over 6K unless they are maxed  because his kit is so awfully predictable. His attacks are quite avoidable and if dodged correctly you literally anulate him. I even saw a Crow dodging in between Bo‚Äôs shots due to their hitboxes, speed and directions being flawedish. And his mines arent useful at all since most brawlers have some kind of escape, if not they just simply step on it and walk away. They aint that useful, especially when a Mortis can just dash through them lol.
---
Goblin slayer eye ! Also looks quite finished to meeee
---
Hell Boy
---
He‚Äôs getting other people‚Äôs posts more attention and credits them. How is that a problem? If my idea didn‚Äôt hit front page I‚Äôd love for someone else to post with credit in the title and for it to reach 1k upvotes.
---
It starts around 300 trophies, but it's not that big a deal. But I went into solo showdown with a 440 trophy Pam and literally everyone in the game was teaming tho, so it gets MUCH worse as you get higher trophies
---
well mine is 483
---
Yes
---
Nicely done
---
I like "no idea why but primo is usually here"
---
I laughed 
---
Your only options are to pay money or to wait for thr RNG gods to bless you, don't worry it'll come. The legendaries might never come (I have 8k and no legendaries) but the epics will come eventually don't worry about it.
---
You can't be against teaming in solo sd and also brag about this stuff. You're still being part of the problem even if you're killing teamers in the process
---
I only have mortis at 3.800 trophies
---
You say this. But I constantly get matches with 400+ people who quit siege if they don‚Äôt get the first siege robot leaving me to 1v3 and 2v3. I screen shot it and post to support, they sent me a link to a post that closed 382 days ago.... 
---
I have to be honest chief, if you think Shelly needs a buff, you're delusional. 
---
Night witch mortis is a tribute to Clash Royales 3rd anniversary. Its meant to be a special skin.

That's because the trajectory of the ball is calculated when you shoot, and when you shot the ball, the wall was here.

Piper is the second suggestion. Coincidence? I think not.

Why is everyone saying Shelly's super is too OP from this video. I mean if it was a Tara super she could have chains super as well. If it was a Dyna super he could continuously throw supers as well. If it was a Brock super it would have been a straight OHKO with 1 super and he will get his super back.
---
Bottomline it is the blue teams fault for grouping up together. A simple Tara super would have swept your entire team. That Shelly needed 3 supers to take you guys out. That kinda means Shelly's super is too weak don't you think so?

I'm clearly in the minority here, but I feel Shelly and Bull are terrible choices in island invasion. Park a ranged guy in the center and wait. You'll get top 3 every time.

if crow sucks, then why do you main him?
---
checkmate. 
---
Well at least you are probably gonna get carl 
---
Imagine bulls Shellys and other campers were unable to walk in bushes 
---
Give this man some gold
---
Honestly I can‚Äôt remember it that well but
---
U invite someone, but they don‚Äôt join instantly 
---
U then invite another person and they join 
---
U move the person who joined after into the spot where the other invited person is being invited 
---
Then that person joins 
---
And boom now there‚Äôs 2 people in 1 spot
---
I have Crow, and I don‚Äôt think he needs a buff, he is awesome in Showdown, and descent in bounty/gem grab/brawl ball/siege. I pushed him on solo Showdown and gem grab mainly. You need to be good at dodging and aiming. Power 5: Rank 19: 468.

Removed - Your post is too short, please expand on your title.
---
They should really add a casual mode where you only get xp
---
I wouldn't mess with Spider Brock tbh especially with 2 launchers
---
Now you probably regret not upgrading your character before the match
---
Brock: I‚Äôm the coolest brawler you‚Äôll ever meet
---
Officer Jessie: no way! I‚Äôm way cooler!
---
I just can't rn

Best one in my opinion, he is just so different than the othersüòç

How about a Yosemite Sam Darryl

---
Step 1 to get good: get your mom's credit card
---
Step 2 : buy mega boxes and get spike
---

---
Also i opened spike from a box 5 min ago
---
Yeah I got this bug at 5k but heard most don't see it until around 10k trophies, guess I got unlucky
---
Well you can use crow, pam, colt, piper,brock, or any other long ranged brawler on island invasion.
---
11.3k

---
Fricking heck
---
I can not unsee the crow :/
---
BULL: Mom said it's my turn to play with the XBox
---
No, so. Lets say i have my shelly at 600 trophies. At season end, this is reset to 550. If I am not at least above 3000 trophies total where i can get a season reward, i won't get anything. All brawlers you unlock are available to you forever. You will never lose you Bo or Dynamike, even if you drop below 3000 trophies. The timer is in the bottom right of the trophy road btw.
---
Imagine ifbi get crow too
---
Honestly doesn't even look real. Amazing!
---
Yes dude i try to balance it in my new map
---
Made me laugh because it's way to accurate 
---
If i* fast typing has its downsides
---
the snake prairie of showdown or cavern churn 2.0
---
Step 5: Hide in your room whilst parents argue. (great time to use spike)
---
I have
---
1 legendary: Crow
---
2 myth. : Tara and Mortis, bringer of doom
---
All epics. 
---
And all other brawlers unlocked except for Bo. Soon tho. 
---
I hope all people get what they want soon üëè
---
Or when u play with crow
---
this would actually end teaming at least for this map
---
Step 6: post on Reddit how you got spike

This is what you see when you die

Cavernchurn is good

The problem is that she can chain her super even against one person and that's ridiculous. The fact that if she has her super she can destroy any close range brawler (even if they have more power cubes) is stupid.

Looks like a 4 leaf clover. Happy St. Paddys Day

r/cursedimages

I understood. I mean I don't think showdown is what's pushing lower skill players.
---
I think what has happened is the flood of new players offered a bunch of trophies to people who weren't that good.
---
The flood made winning way easier, specifically at lower ranks and for those who paid for power. I think there were enough new players to push a bunch of bad players way up. I mean you can still find gem suiciders and bounty rushers into the 400s.
---
As for Mortis, at power ten he is pretty big in his niche maps/modes. I'm not surprised you could get him up, especially if you did premades with good team composition. The Mortis/Frank pickups made them stronger, because you could scatter them across the map and only use them as needed. They were way too strong.

Long range dominates late game for Island Invasion, as long as they don't get teamed on. I would say the same for eye of the storm as well. Check the bushes and you're fine. I'd say tanks are more annoying than strong for that map.

I probably did before I knew teaming was loose against, and was new to the game (less then 2000 Trophies)
---
Can you add the special character tasks?
---
Ex:
---
1-Kill 50 enemies with Colt
---
2-Play 100 matches with Colt
---
3-Win 20 matches with Colt
---
The reward is gold,tickets,gems or esclusive skins
---
Honestly I think the biggest thing with siege is they need to make it so you have to go near your side of the map to throw bolts to the turret. Maybe just inside the range of your turrets shots.   
---
Stop someone from greedily overextending until they throw that bolt then die. Or you can't camp the middle and pick up 4-5 bolts without moving back a bit to deliver. 
---
Color it!
---
Two franks will team on the middle loading each others super and so destroying the walls to kill the other players.
---
There isn‚Äôt really any ordering required. If you have any level 8 brawlers that you want to upgrade to lvl 9 to potentially get star power I suggest you open the smaller boxes, and upgrade the level 8 when you have enough gold, as soon as possible. Don‚Äôt get too carried away.

---
I never play on WiFi because of the lag. It seems like it should be the same speed or faster than data network. Lag is a killer 
---
I have to completely disagree with the Darryl change. His health is already the lowest of any heavyweight, he doesn‚Äôt need any less. What I would personally want is to remove the outermost projectiles from each attack, and increase his damage per shell by 25% to compensate. This makes hitting all his shots a lot easier, because you have to deal with 8 instead of 10 plus the whole ‚Äúboth attacks aim in different spots‚Äù thing.
---
Supercell has already responded to many of this type of situation and will NOT CHANGE your name unless it is offensive after the name change(which produdu isn‚Äôt.).

There really isn‚Äôt much of a solution to teaming‚Ä¶ Supercell can‚Äôt ban, since they need huge amounts of manpower, and if they hopes to use bots, they will need to spend time programming it, and even then it might not be fully accurate and ban innocents who are just spinning to BM. Furthermore, as mentioned in the AMA, the way to express‚ÄùI want to team‚Äù could just be changed by the community(strafing left-right, up-down, diagonally, hugging a wall, possibilities are endless.) 
---
I know how to read. Can you imagine people playing in this map? 
---
Colt
---
It‚Äôs still only 30ish players. And there‚Äôs **a lot more players who play brawlstars** im 100% sure the result won‚Äôt even be close to being the same if every brawlstars player voted.
---
Once you defeat all the other brawlers, Pam is the final boss.

#so god damn accurate
---
Unless your robots always push to your right, and enemy bots push to your left. They would never meet in the middle (or anywhere) and honestly it should just be that way for all sieges, because as it currently stands you can almost kill an IKE with the first siege, even without anywhere near max brawlers, and this would add more strategy to the mode/make it a little longer.

So all the people commenting here are sucking you off for karma right? Bette than art right? How about this. Who plays solo showdown? Who? You heard of Siege - no you don‚Äôt play that. You heard of smash and grab - no you don‚Äôt play that. You heard of heist - no you don‚Äôt play that. You heard of BRAWL BALL - no you dont play that. Your clown ass plays 1 mode. Solo showdown. And complains about it. Hey fucko. Play another mode. Nobody wants to see this shit. I‚Äôm not here to suck you off for karma and you can downvote me as expected. I should get about 10-15 downvotes for this. But what I‚Äôm saying is true fucko
---
I mean same
---
Or how about that the bolts don't freaking spawn ONLY on the side where all 3 of the enemy team are camping? 
---
yo nice work
---
It would be crazy fun to play on this map
---
Dang I wish I had the money for photoshop.

Actually technically if there are 8 people left one of them is you. So that would mean it was 7v1v1v1. Still impressive none the less

:brock:

---
No jump pads are actually 2x2 so the bots can jump on them
---
the fastest the backstab in the west 
---
no really did you saw how with one spin the dyna gained auto trust and not even half a second after the backstab happens
---
Light bolt: the player who picks it up will remain lighted (and so reveal your and near teammates' position) until next siege.
---
Shadow bolt: this bolt won't affect the bolt count on your team because it's just a... shadow. Also, your vision in bushes will be reduced until next siege.
---
TP bolt: if you can send it to your base, you will be teleported to the base.
---
Then you would have a choice to either defend or Attack, but I feel this could drag the mode on too far if both team just consistently decide to defend each other‚Äôs bots. Furthermore, Siege‚Äôs game time is fine as it is. We high trophy players need to find the fastest way to get the most trophies. An ideal game of siege will be closed out by the 2nd robot, 1:45 in, for 10 trophies, compared to other modes, this is more than twice as fast.

The top left corner should be bigger and more in the center, hence ‚Äúancient ruins‚Äù add pixel brushes in them as well. Good map name for a showdown though!

You‚Äôll probably get all legendaries before you get the 530 gems. Legendaries aren‚Äôt easy to get. Just keep your expectations Low so you won‚Äôt be disappointed.

Ahahaha there is only dynamike that teaming
---
Shelly looks like momo xD
---
i advised to Frank in twitter long time ago also.
---
nothing happened
---
I'll do it but I couldn't understand the "pixel brushes". Can you explain please?
---
Maybe something like a "Fatigue Bolt" where whoever picks it up deals 50% less damage for 10s or something. Essentially it would be crow's star power but much more detrimental.

This totally ruined solo showdown for me. Even though I pushed my acc to almost 6k on solo showdown. But nowadays it feels like not even Teamers are ruining the game for you, but rng too. 
---
This is the definition of chaotic good. To be able to kill the teamers, first he must team with the teamers
---
Buff crow bolt: Buffs any Crows on the map. Bad if there is a Crow on the opposing team.
---
Random bolt: Gives a random bolt. Is rainbow colour. When you pick it up it gives you a random bolt. For example: If you pick it up it it will give you a freeze bolt and will freeze you. Or if you're lucky a normal bolt. 
---
I think this would be better in modifiers like showdown. You probably know why, it's hard to explain it.
---

Somewhere either under the comment box or app settings should be an option "Fancy Pants Editor"

This will fix spacing, bringing it back to normal, just like in your notepad where when you double press space it will leave one blank line and the writing will be on the second one.

yes you have to go to the shop, click on the big box or mega box, and press the ‚Äúi‚Äù in the top left corner

Well the concept of siege is to last longer, so while I understand where you‚Äôre coming from, that‚Äôs not *really* the point of the mode. It also seems to snowball really easily, even after the change, and the games I play (at 2k trophies) are almost never even close.

Lag in this game can be unbearable and seems everyone is heavily affected by it. Often my teammates and enemies will just stand still in the middle of action.
---
Any damage caused should be percentile as to avoid making the game mode advantageous to high hp brawlers. 
---
I changed it in the original website.  Thanks for telling me!

Wow how did it happened

Pff, saving boxes.  I'm still missing all Legendary brawlers + Gene @ 8k cups.  I open every god damn box I get.

Good morning developers, could you please tell me how or when I could denounce a player for playing in a game? It has already happened to me a few times that I play and purposely make us lose, for example throwing the ball in my own goal. It's really frustrating to know that I can not do anything when I play players like that.
---
also the weird flex meme died like 2 months ago
---
Croatian youtubers (or any non-english speaking youtubers) steal 90% of their content. In the last 3 years Croatian community is bassicaly copying English youtubers and stealing their videos.

---
OH HELL NO

Oh wait now i figured out Ur Photoshop.. XD 
---
The nostalgia is killing me
---
I did not say that, however, bush camping has centralized the meta for a large portion of the player base. The game is played however the community reacts to the situation and most of the solo SD maps have large continuous bushes in the center of the map. This layout benefits shot gun brawlers the most.
---
The other issues I noted are with Shelly's design, not the maps. Overall, she is balanced on most gem grab maps, and matchup dependant for the other game modes outside of bounty, which she is weaker.
---
Ahh ok I get it now yah that would be a good thing too
---
Yes. How can you get a star power for a power cube?

The team in control of the bolt spawning area is already at a huge advantage

Crow is about to super Shelly              F

The other Bull was maxed, so I guess that was a factor as well. If you manage to get two Bull teammates, make sure the higher level one gets the Power Cubes.

No, Crow needs a really small buff, and a nerf to Pam, his poison-effect already is really good

I love Braw star and i think It si a very beautifull game

Yeah, there are so many more inputs than COC and Royale that it has to record, so they are preparing the servers to allow replays for everybody. Should come out soon :)

That's why you don't spam autoaim

You forgot that darryl that thinks he can play with the big shot gunners

I love it when the teamers don't do the maths. I had the bright idea of playing Jessie on this map yesterday, looked down and found six throwers. There were seven brawlers left, and I'm happy to say that I won with 1 powercube.

I think instead of buffing his damage they should buff his charge rate for his super. You are right he has a strong super, the only problem is that it takes 2759273738 years to charge. A buff to the charge rate would make him more viable in gem grab and bounty.
---
no need dude i uninstalled the game
---
&gt;I hate those players in showdown
---
Why? I love facing them. Easy win
---
I hate playing againsed Frank even tho he is bottom tier. His stun lasts wayyy too long imo.
---
too bad. lost hope already. fuck this game 
---
Counter, high lvl leon is just to op, in to short time he gets you high dmg, no metter how much hp you have. And shelly is ok, not soo op like leon, but in shadowdown for example you have 12 powerups and still shelly with 2 powerups and ult kill you in oneshot, what is kinda unfair.

Whenever I team I just betray them first chance I get, even if that means I need to get a quick kill with them before hand. Teaming should be fixed tho it's actually toxic for 6v1 or whatever to be in any game

They add new brawlers and stuff, but what use are they in 1v9? You say the truth and get downvoted for it, heh
---
Also teaming is currently the best strategy at higher levels. Kairos' #stopthespin did help, but it was temporary and players who contributed suffered from trophy loss. To win you need to team, so you either go with the flow or lose trophies. No #stopthespin initiative can root out teaming utterly, and that's why it will keep spreading. Only devs can fix teaming.
---
You should probably ask on r/BrawlStarsCompetitive instead
---

Whats wrong with fortnite? Damn everyone is hating on my fav game üòÖüò≠

You see, remove those two and all that's left for Shelly is Feast or Famine. She would simply suck in all the other maps simply due to low damage and being easily outranged. Plus, if you're looking for a showdown map to push Crow on, these are the ones.
---
Don't worry, we still have double trouble. You know, where you see neither Shelly nor Bull because it's full of Brocks.

Y que hago con eso?

Lo siento si es una pregunta pendeja xD

I do agree, but back in the days when it took 6 hits (with poison), he was the strongest brawler in the game. I don‚Äôt want this to happen to Crow because that would make Showdown even worse. (especially if the crows are teaming)

You are acting like there is some easy solution to teaming when there isnt.Banning would be too much as the dev team is very small and this would take a long time to do.The only really other way would to be changing the core mechanics of showdown to not favor teamers.
