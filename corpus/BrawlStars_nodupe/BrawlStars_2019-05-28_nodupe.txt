I bullieve you

Yea I misspelled map by accident the first time :|

hehehehe
---
I think so
---
Why do you think hes not being released for another 5 days? Theyre still working on it.
---
Same! I got crow at like 3 am!
---
I love the paladin piper idea... except she‚Äôs not melee
---
RIP scrappy
---
snipping tool, am i right?
---
so you mean to tell me the only thing in the update was skins and its taking them over a month just to add sounds for them lol supercell is actually pathetic
---
Ankle breakers
---
I‚Äôm watching this match on Ash‚Äôs channel right now. Thanks for spoiling it. 
---
Just kidding. Good job. Must take a lot of skill to beat top players :)
---
eh the community itself isn't very toxic, it's the fuckers on the outside like you who make it hard to say you play the game lmao
---
Oh no
---
I‚Äôm not saying that they shouldn‚Äôt be punished. I‚Äôm just saying that they used more toned down ways. Ex: The meteors target brawlers close to each other. Healing mushrooms spawn away from brawler that are close, etc.
---
If you are asking if you can do this in the actual training cave in-game, no
---
and when you do hit something..sometime there s no sound from the hit...so kinda annoying
---
What are those "friends" that you mention?
---
Or noobs getting leon and crow in two consecutive boxes
---
And people think he needs a buff
---
Ok thx
---
All good maps except Radio Rave. It has way too much bushes like Eye of the Storm. Juts remove some bushes and were golden:)
---
i didn't really want to debate, but it's just a friendly reminder to attack shelly from far range. I agree with you, there is no point in arguing on a subreddit for a mobile game, that'd just seem unprofessional
---
really nice art style, and I like how you payed tribute to the video :)
---
umm
---
There‚Äôs an area that can be captured by a singular team, of which a maximum of 3 areas separated from one another. More points captured = more points gained. First team to reach 1,000 points wins.
---
Not particularly, this season is where I‚Äôve been pushing a lot with high win streaks
---
Thats Similar name as u/SubGetsTheStix
---
but, shelly's super won't do much to teamers, it does little damage at far range
---
Barlette
---
oh yeah, he told me he took inspiration from my name in his name
---
Oh thats same person as Subsaibot47
---
Yeah, Bibi will have a LOT of rework.
---
seriously? wait, that name rings a bell, who was that again, I remember it was someone good.
---
Glad people know so much about the game. Yes, minus the powercube bonus it could be a Tara, Penny, Jessie or Leon. But bots can be Carl but not Bibi, so it can't be a Tara or Leon.
---
u/Subsaibot47 got banned here i believe

u/Brawlstarsplayer is the same person too

Pika what do you mean you are one of the best bull player ever of course you will play against pros and other op player like patchy and jiggy. The skin is just for youtubers so top players should see it more commonly for the next couple days.
---
welp
---
I'm not Christian... so... yeah.... BUFF SHELLY
---
Well yes but technically no for the other person you start yours first .
---
Part 1/6??
---
Me: Wow, this is great!!
---
Also me: welp i said i would review this, and here we are. 
---
(INTERNAL SCREAMING)
---
Alright, lets get started.
---
Rink: Maybe this could be a Christmas/Winter event modifier, It would be good for Bibi to use to knock people into these screwing them over.If brawlers are knocked back do they slide across the ice? üëç10/10
---
Spotlight: this sounds like a great concept, it would prevent bush camping, and it is straight to the point. Would it be destryable by Supers? 9/10
---
Static Barriers: I feel like the health should be not that high, because It would take at least 4 attacks, and I feel like  it should just take three. How long would the barrier be?
---
Got cut short cuz of time.
---
 Part 2 tommarrow (hopefully)
---
Ssd if you have a brawler that can counter teaming or you‚Äôre simply good at it
---
Dsd if you and a friend are good-can be done with randos but be sure to pick a brawler that can carry in that case
---
Heist probably the best game mode for playing with randoms as you can kinda solo if you pick a good offensive brawler for the map and your teammates have at least 27 brain cells
---
Gem grab is kinda mixed, i personaly only play for the star token besides on one or two maps for nita i forgot the names sorry. Be carefull and try to play a gem carrier or an alt gem carrier(bo is an alt gem carrier, usualy fighter, but plays gem carrier if no gem carrier on team)
---
Seige the answer is no without a team. Only play if felling reaaaly lucky or need the star token
---
Brawl ball is another safe bet with a good character for the map you can do well if your teammates know what to do you should be mostly fine.
---
Bounty is basically the same as brawl ball, play the right character and you should be mostly good to go
---
~TheSmallRaptor
---
It‚Äôs a creeper
---
There was a time when brawl ball was good but I stopped playing it because of the spawn points
---
They need remodels more than Piper jesus christ (except spike and poco)
---
Oh god, i havnt even finished part 3 review
---
something
---
u/Ryan_SuperCell
---
I love how the trophy fits his hand
---
Its honestly better because of the spawns you dont have to run all the way around anymore and people cant camp with the ball after one goal behind the goal
---
Then use spoiler instead
---
Anf
---
It's so easy to level them up when you don't get any brawler.
---
*cries in a corner*
---
To be honest. I really don't care if Gedi's work will make it into BrawlStars, its a fan suggestion and that's all it will be. (Not jealous by the way, I just simply do not care at all)

Ohh i never get to try his star power back in the days when he used to be too fast so yea, thanks for pointing that out

Ahem, what the guy doesn't understand is that if you decrease the reload speed it DECREASES the amount of time you are requires to wait, But if you increase the reload speed you INCREASE the requires time by more seconds. So for reloading Decreasing is a good thing.
---
His bats are pepperoni. And also very nice work

Oh right, good point there! Thank you!

No
---
After looking at this more, the spawn points may need to be tweaked a little bit, because if you start and your crow or primo has super they can just hop over to the goal and get the ball passed to them
---
Nita doesn‚Äôt need a buff

My idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthis map is that all kinds of brawlers are meta.

Supercell gave a challenge to a bunch of YouTubers. The gist of it is that they have to record themselves playing Bibi on Showdown, and every time they get a power cube, they put a piece of bubblegum in their mouth (each piece is one point). At the end of the match, if the YouTuber can blow a bubble, their score for that game is doubled. Whichever YouTuber ends up having the most points in any given game wins.
---
oh no, russians —Åapture the game. Help!!!

Autoaim is very usefull in close range battle, I wouldn't kick out this feature completelly. In mid and long range - yes, you have to learn how to aim
---
Hey!  I know this anime
---
My friend got 4 high rarity brawlers in a week including crow at 900 trophies which really is demoralizing for players like me at 5.5k trophies. They don't priority spam autoaim which is starting to make me think they actually deserve those brawlers a little more but nonetheless its pretty insane

Nobody cares

Damn you must spend a lot of money to have maxed powerpoints at only 10k
---
Thank you!
---
Serously NO, Mortis is not gonna get overpowered. Playing him in showdown is basically suicide with at least 2 brawlers THAT ARE NOT TEAMING TARGETING YOU. To most people mortis is basically a powercube unless he wastes time hiding in bushes. #StopMortiscism
---
same here
---
It don‚Äôt exist anymore, has been fixed
---
Idk why they give free skins to youtubers
---
i wish i could give you 100 upvotes
---
he do more damage whit less life, his super is necessary to not risk too much the death
---
Sorry, I just thought it was the humiliation of those you killed.
---
congratz man
---
j ai fais cette map siege pour la mettre sur brawl star merci si vous la mettez
---
Jajajaja I think you meant to say star power
---
When you initiate the attack before homerun bar isn't even charged, even tho it's going to charge completely after you press the attack button (say you attack with the homerun bar being 2/3s on its way to being full) it isn't gonna have the knockback.
---
hey, I didn‚Äôt get gene until a month after his release, what was he like before the nerf took place? Just curious :)

Thx

Woah I would pay anything for one of these brawlers! Great job!

---
I only played siege for 6 times... I thought that I am the one who plays siege the least here XD
---
I see, thank you !!
---
I literally got Leon the same time
---
That's too much and ridiculous.
---
is this made for darryl‚Äôs long roll?
---
Sure thing
---
I don‚Äôt know, i play him only in 3v3 modes not showdown, so that‚Äôs probably your problem, in 3v3 the outplay is letting your teammates do enough damage that you can finish the job
---
How can that mean that they are noobs?
---
Because of the blank black background, this will get stolen easily by only blocking ur watermwark with the same black-coloured border

Why is there a sea bear outside?!

Kind of looks like a thumbs down but it is fine,I cannot waste another 3 hours doing that

Siege is like heist and gem grab combined I don‚Äôt understand why they made siege make you lose so much trophies
---
Throwers are not too op in this map i made not too many houses, this has bushes, and open places, so throwers are not too op here

well this is deepfried

You dont have to play siege if you dont want to

This was copied from my last post it was posted 2 mins after mine

This can be "perfectly do gamemode objectives 50 times"

Hold gems for 15 times

Have 7 star on your head and HOLD them until end of the game for 5 times

It‚Äôs like that every time supercell makes a new brawler and that brawler has so many problems

I think with shelly you sometimes have to aim to tag the enemy to charge your super and stop them from healing

Personally I want it to be in game

Fvck i wanted to comment that
---
? Lol what do you mean?

Yes

Brock can auto aim sometimes tho. He should be in 50 50. Its the only reason he is better the piper. Bc he can burst on melee range and "burst" basicly equels to auto aim

---
true
---
Oo yes that would be interesting, or how about both bots will spawn for all sieges, the bots have a little fight in the middle, then the survivor makes his way to the other side to attack the turret.
---
The turret would have to reduce in health in this case
---
Randoms can be bad as hell, specially when they are 120 level 5k trophies xD.
---
None of my friends kept playing Brawl stars. So i soent over 90% of the game playing with randoms. Im at level 99 and 8600 trophies which i think is decent. Its just the matter of luck of finding good randoms. Most of the times that i climbed it was with 2 randoms who are also good and we just went play again for 20 games. But nonetheless i had bad randoms a lot as well. Id call it a 50/50
---
So thats what mortis does in the night??
---
The main point here is: If I had a squad (me forever alone)
---
I think  you didn't perform the edit quite well in the lower brawlers there's a black screen that already been boarded out of each brawler

not a good idea, you are giving elprimo a reason to jump in the enemys while having 10 gems

that will make random much more suicidal in gem grab, bounty and siege. i don't like it but with some tweaks maybe it should work

Gene‚Äôs hand does damage (like it used to). This would make it unable for the pulled people to heal.
---
If your team is coordinated enough and obviously that much better than the other team, you're going to win regardless of how many sieges it takes.
---
The point being made is that, assuming semi-equal skill level, the last team that wins siege is going to win the whole game.  The reasoning for that is that a team can specifically refuse to win a round so they can easily win the next one.  Meaning if they know they can stall long enough to get to that point, they can easily just blow out the other team by having a massive bot to push with.
---
yee
---
there is an J next to the :c
---
I basically never used to play nita because it felt really awkward in most modes but in siege the bear can easily take control of the middle by forcing enemies to retreat to fight the bear. Then you can easily collect the parts.
---
Maybe it was a really shitty big box
---
Give him some credit. It‚Äôs likely higher than Shelly‚Äôs.

Congratulations you lose your trophies for nothing this isn‚Äôt even funny

How the fuck is a zigzag similar to doubling back? Besides, we weren't even discussing Penny, only her mortar. If we're discussing Penny, let's also talk about her teammate Gene who just coincidentially pulls you out of the mortar's way, or your teammate Frank that freezes the mortar.
---
And if you think a zigzag is predictable, you're out of your mind. Of course I don't mean literally moving left and right every second, I mean switching your horizontal movement while also going vertically. Done right, it's nigh impossible to hit.
---
Thanks man!! :)

Flying discobot: 2x2 floating two armed robot with hover instead of legs and metal afro. Moves very slowly, but teleports 7 tales away each time he takes 3% of damage.
---
As basic attack he throws out a disco ball that explodes into 8 rainbow bullets (like Spike‚Äôs granades). Randomly, he can also spin himself after teleportating. While doing this, all bullets that touch his hitbox are reflected and aimed into those who shooted them (excluding his own, Nita, Frank and El primo ones, that just dont hit him durning spin)
---
Additionaly while in rage, he shoot three Poco attack like soundwaves around himself. Rage mode also makes him shoot two disco balls.
---
On Insane, he can also fire homing missle as fast as regular brawler, wich explodes into two small and round sound waves.
---
Let's talk about the worst star power in the game. Penny!
---
Penny's new star power should increase the amount of damage done by the coins from Penny's regular attack. I don't mean the money bag. I mean the money **inside** the bag. That way, you will have to focus more on lining up the opponents. This will make Penny's star power more reliable because her mortar is already op. The mortar shouldn't get buffed by the star power.
---
TL;DR: Increase the damage done by the coins that come out of Penny's regular attack.
---
It is, but four tiles of vision doesn't give you any major advantage - almost every brawler can still hit you, and it's much harder to avoid them before they do. When it was 6 tiles, it made a big difference.
---
I don't think he is complaining about the level matchmaking...

---
Sure, but I'm saying that is just one strategy and there are multiple ones that work. That can totally backfire if you just straight up lose during the opponents robot. Some teams are good at controlling the mid, but bad at capitalizing on their robots. Some are better equipped to defend against robots. Some teams are just a mess and can't do anything because they get brawlers that don't synergize.     
---
Playing the long game in siege is no different in my opinion than playing gem grab with a Tara or Gene being the linchpin of your team and relying on a big swing of gems at the end with a well placed super.
---
Very cool man, nice job !
---
Yeah, when i play aganist penny is very annoying, especially because it seems that the mortar never fails
---
Mortis: ey bb check out pp
---
Guys we did it teaming is no more
---
Barley: The more times in a row you hit someone, the more damage it does.
---
Jessie: The turret's bullets now bounce to different people
---
Bo: You get your ultimate upon killing someone, but you have to have done at least 50% of their health
---
El Primo: Your super flies 25% faster at all ranges except melee range (so that you can still dodge supers)
---
A win can lead you to glory and loose will destroy everything
---
Wtf no.
---
Why is it heist combined with Brawl Ball?
---
Thank you!! üòä

Wow that‚Äôs the first time I‚Äôve beard someone call robot rumble vault defenders
---
Damn this is good
---
Thats bandita but still a nice one
---
Should require more kills and should be more rewarding
---
Yes. Let's stop teaming in a different way
---
When Crow poisons a brawler, the poison will spread to anyone on a 4 tile radius around the poisoned brawler.
---
I‚Äôd switch penny‚Äôs star power. Where the mortar can detect people in the bushes
---
I‚Äôd switch Nita star power. Let the bear run faster than the brawler ( just like Tara‚Äôs clone) so it will be able to get hits. 
---
I‚Äôd switch gene‚Äôs star power. I‚Äôd extend her super so the arm can reach farther.
---
It could help stop those jumping primos with 15 gems.
---
Cuz then manually aiming wouldnt be a thing if autoaiming would target the nearest spot.
---
Lmaoooooo
---
Swap Frank and Spike and this list would be near perfect
---
I thought it was Sans, but i when i saw image not spoiled then I got it

I know how you did it. You bought bandita shelly and showed the silhoette
---
Ok
---
Oh no, he gonna give us a bad time
---
As far as I know, they've announced literally nothing.
---
Why is there no info about it
---
El Primo‚Äôs should be more game changing, considering it‚Äôs what we need to keep him good competitively but not ruin him with new players. I was thinking maybe a range increase for a short time when he gets a kill.
---
you don't deserve rights
---
If your gonna hate on Fortnite then at least get facts straight brawl stars came out AFTER Fortnite.

I'm really confused on why it says 205 out of 10 kills but no boxes given

---
Finally a good idea sharing environment. I think a simple but effective idea is to have another star power in which Carl would get a boost of movement speed whenever his health is below a certain point (he IS in a minecart) 
---
Another idea I had is to Mortis and I think it‚Äôs pretty interesting. Going along with his vampire theme, whenever Mortis is about to die and the shot that would kill him connects, he would survive that shot. 
---
For example, if he had 600 health and a Bibi attacks connects with him, a shield would summon and ‚Äúblock‚Äù that attack. But, this only works for one projectile as well. If Rico were to super me and I was one shot, I would survive the first shot but not the following projectiles.

That's what I believe is being said though.  The team that's doing the stalling is obviously smart enough and understands the game mode well enough that they can abuse the mechanics like that without losing.
---
As you said, you can't always rely on a single strategy.  Though I'd take the stall strat over the aggro strat any day when it comes to pubs.
---
But you still need manual aiming for the trick shots and just juking the opponent

The map looks good, but the map can be really unfair as the duo teams in middle bottom and top can have 6 powerboxes nearly... Like, let it be more balanced so every team can get the same max ammoumt of boxes..

 I swear that mine too,  my friends started playing Bs since global, but now they get bored, so I¬¥m the only one still playing. Now they play Cr, I don¬¥t know why. And then me and one friend play CoC too hahaha.  I hope that Supercell gives us a good update for June, that it¬¥s time, and so everyone returns to play .

But why, why would you do that?

oh yea

You mean capture the flag

Good

I hope they add it
---
I think it would be interesting to have Bibi‚Äôs Star Power work with her knock back mechanic. Like it blocks attacks or supers. Or it is able to deflect attacks back at the opponent and it damage them with their own attack.
---
Example: Dynamike lobs dynamite at you but you use your bat when it‚Äôs meter is full to knock it back at him (provided you are at the right angle to do so). 
---
I would love to have this!

I freakin' love that
---
Right, I am fifteen and fortnite already bore enough people of my age, instead children of 12 years of my school only think of fortnite and pokemon go xd.
---
since you nerfed the crap out of leon, I want to ask if you can add a star power to him that allows his shurikens to be able to ghost through blocks, but it will only work if he is using his super.  So whenever he activates his super, if he wants to, his first attack while he is invisible, will be able to go through walls.  I know it is a weird request, but it would make up for what happened to leon.

Take my upvote

Brick won too. r/brockkgang
---
That‚Äôs what I would of done. Then I would of thought stupidly and use the super on the walls to free him. Lol
---
It seems that you need to remodel Bo.
---
I think it is the best to make starlevels like in clash royal and with each level the starpower will becoming better.
---
First of all if you get an account it's most likely going to be around the 500 trophies range and that's if you get one, which is also unlikely
---
I am trying to show some :)
---
I am patient lol, it's just a light hearted meme
---
Hahaha thanks for your personal medal
---
Yeah happens sometimes to me too. This video should be enough for supercell to ban him for some time.
---
I understand all of it, but a light hearted meme is never harmful.
---
Actually Spike's condom broke and so appeared Rosa
---
This is good. NO! Its the best map of showdown I've ever seen!
---
And I'm depressed to be the first Barley player in my country and not have Leon.
---
If its minecraft my upvote shall always be there
---
Goodbye.
---
Not as slow as spike but yeah
---
Good job, you destroyed some walls I guess?
---
Its not a disgusting habit tho lol
---
Thank you kind sir
---
But you are not better than CanYaDigIt!
---
This is common with maps that have wall in front of the goal... but just until a certain trophy range
---
Cuz his damage is so low and he‚Äôs basically useless in solo SD
---
maybe they're related
---
explains why i hate them both with a **burning passion**
---
I meant, like get player‚Äôs data. Not the api but how do you make it, where it comes from because as far as I know sc does not have an api
---
the range is okay but it should be fixed because of the blind spots she has. just her knockback range should be reduced. Otherwise she‚Äòs well balanced imo
---
Genie = Gene
---
That's a cool idea
---
omg idk why i laughed so hard xD
---
üòï Wow
---
Maybe if I just play more solo sd I'll get better. Funny how that might work. I usually only play it to get brawlers to around 300 then never play them on solo sd again.
---
  
---
Idk what to do with the teaming. I'm afraid to team and not to team. If I team, they might betray me or try to and get us both killed. If I don't, I die to them and all the ppl teaming with them. And other times I just die to teamers completely randomly. They don't wanna team with me, they chase me, nobody will team with me against them, I lose 5-7 trophies.
---
Is he a difficult brawler to use?
---
Then just aim manually instead of quickfiring???
---
Every FCKIN time!
---
ok
---
are you doing this to get banned or you just stealing
---
I wAnT mY MoMmY
---
When Darryl rolls, his roll extends by 5 tiles for each wall he bounces, while gaining a shield that blocks 25 percent of taken damage.
---
Pam extra parts when the enemy walks into the turret range they et the poison effect.
---
Bebe batter up she can wack her bubble gum
---
I already watched it and you'll love how this show ends
---
Maybe not this exact idea cause of the comments above, but I would like more of a reward for getting kills (mainly in showdown). I mean, nobody likes owning the first two people in the match and then getting killed and losing trophies. All that hard work for nothing. SUPERCELL FIX THIS!
---
It's natural to have problems upon release, look at Mars from Dota 2 as an example
---
Gene buff? How about no
---
happy cake day
---
yes correct right before it is charged.
---
Bruh mortis is ONLY good because of his star power and you‚Äôre gonna remove that?
---
You would go to the highest most magical part of heaven
---
espero que les guste mi idea acerca de un nuevo mapa para brawl stars
---
 16 what?  Martian years?  Jupiter years? Centuries?
---
what
---
You have to remember that this game is balanced around the middle of the pack. If Mortis is only balanced in the hands of a skilled player, he isn‚Äôt balanced. Bull on the other hand, autoaim and you can win
---
Nice
---
Lmao you dumbass it‚Äôs erpip
---
Shes fine, the only problem is her weird blind spot
---
having her star power definitely helped she became really fast. I wasn‚Äôt really planning on pushing to 600+ it just kinda happened I got to 500 by sd and heist and when I was 500 played a couple siege and was at 650. Im top 20 on leaderboards now but I was 3rd after my push
---
Pam could have her torrent poison enemies inside the ring.
---
Dayummm sexy. r/brockkgang
---
she's pretty difficult to use, she has the smallest range in the game, as well as landing them are equally as hard. She also suffers if a power gap is too much, say one enemy is a power level over you, you're going to feel very squishy, more so than even rico sometimes.
---
Clapping makes me want to take your side on this
---
Bull: can stop his super at the cost of 1 ammo. So if he uses it and wants to stop near an enemy he can waste 1 ammo (just hits attack button and it stops him but he doesn‚Äôt actually shoot)
---
Poco: Super should still damage enemies (amount of regular shot but has bigger range and goes over walls) so it‚Äôs not a big upgrade but substantial enough making him more viable in showdown
---
That‚Äôs crow bb
---

why shelly's, you realize so many other supers do more damage, like rico or something

If you know, you know
---
yeahüò¨
---
I brother in arm
---
Sorry it was Leon tho
---
why does everyone think shelly and bull are good in snae prarie, well, a full team of them, my brother had that team comp and got rekt by brock colt and piper.
---
Ya but I‚Äôm sad that happened I tried to quickly swipe but I tapped and it lost me my team they left me and our team had won like 13 in a row so it made me sad
---
Hi, can I use your clip for one of my funny moments videos? I will give you credit.
---
Honestly that's pretty true. That stuff bullshit tho
---
That‚Äôs not how auto aim works for goals if you auto aim with the ball it goes to the center of the goal with or without your super
---
Next level teaming.
---
I haven‚Äôt got Shelly yet how do you get her?
---
She does...almost every brawler has one so she should get one too...but I think she deserves a skin and a remodel first...
---
 ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
I can already see the bulls
---
No,the skin will come before the box
---
True...Idk what supercell is thinking, they gave gene a voice in the next update of his release, same with carl and rosa...next update we will probably get a voice for bibi because idk what supercell is thinking to not give tara, darryl and leon voices before the newer brawlers...It would be alot more fair
---
NoT tHE fAcE!

Asistant- when Penny's cannon is placed, her damage increases by 15%

No Clash ideas allowed here. Nice idea though, I genuinely like it. There‚Äôs just no way for it to be realistically implemented into Brawl Stars.

You clearly didn't understand the purpose of this post...
---
Thats not a concept its a CR/CoC crossover
---
Trash
---
Guess you deleted a comment? Didnt read it. But anyway, yeah its Leon. I lost faith in getting a Legendary. After Bibi came out i though: yeah, one more brawler which will decrease your chance to get a legendary.
---
Idk what I just looked at but I like it
---
Bruh...hold up a little bit. First should tara get skins before anyone because she was in the game for almost 2 years and has no skins and no voices while leon was in the game for 6 months and he had his time of being game breakingly op..So tara deserves a skin, remodel and/or a voice before leon to be much more fair.
---
Nah
---
I know that
---
They all look amazing but that Leon tho !

I didn‚Äôt delete a comment lol but anyways at least you got a a legendary I‚Äôm jealous

SC does but remodeling brawlers takes a long time (more time then making skins SC said) and they have to remodel certain brawler first before they can add their skins.
