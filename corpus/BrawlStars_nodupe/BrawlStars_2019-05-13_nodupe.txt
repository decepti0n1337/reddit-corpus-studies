I like this it would incorporate some more strategy into the game and the ability to build your brawler to your play style
---
Who has agent colt

who autoaims mortis
---
Yeah i think thats him i mean tge name is purple like in his videos and the characters for his name are the same
---
Agreed
---
are you happy about unlocking a brawler you knew it was gonna happen in a few days no matter what? more than a legendary, wich people play for a year without unlocking? it just doesn't make sense

Yep. Honestly this seems to have been made into a way bigger deal then it should be, and let's be honest, if he posted it on Insta it seems sus that he didn't also post it on Reddit.

Cool idea but they would make the skin very expensive like maybe 150 or even 300 gems

#PARKOUROW

U played that pretty bad ngl 
---
Here comes the downvotes
---
My team hit 0% first and the screen panned to the enemy safe.
---
hide in bushes more. when the other team wasn't even on your screen, you were just doing circles in the centre. the large advantage of Leon is his super but I don't think I saw you use it more than once that entire match. if the other team can't see you, hide in a bush and hover over your super so you can run up on someone and surprise them. 
---
also, spread out from your teammates more. Leon should be used on the sides of the map, for sneaking up on people and supporting your gem carrier. you were largely all grouped up in the centre, so it's a good idea to spread out.
---
I hope that helps!
---
Well u didn't put smile like this üòÄüòÇü§£

---

This matchup might not be best representation since Leon is best used to bully the less tanky brawlers. Maybe one thing u can do is spam your shots less and save at least two shots to burst them down when they get up close or if gene pulls in one of their tanks. Maybe if the opportunity presents itself u can be more aggro with your super (or without, if you are confident) and harry them from behind or the sides so that u can create space in the mid for gene to pick up gems. Its quite congested in the center on this map and hard for your gem carrier to get anywhere close without massive risk if their tanks are pacing within the channels and within range. Leon‚Äôs good at pushing brawlers around or and drawing them away. While not ideal but I think u didn‚Äôt do too badly. I think erring on the side of being conservative is always good. (Obviously I never follow my own advice)
---
Of this goes
---
Please leave suggestions for more brawlers to draw, Rosa and Spike are next be sure to check those out when I finish drawing them
---
Aren't  they in the umbrella and thats why its stays closed when pipes snipes but it opens and the bombs comes out and then the umbrella opens?

No, it‚Äôs fine.

I think time to explain

Ah, OK, I like one piece too

I'm at 8k right now with no legendary brawlers. I have the ones i like the most to play (poco, tara, jessie, nita, primo and Frank) between 400 and 500 and all the others non-legendaries between 300 and 400
---
Images should be flipped.

She couldn't really go to the side tho because there was a rosa contesting and it is hard for a leon to push her out

Well mine is at 450 trophies so,whatever they say I like this brawlerüòÇ

Both are equally good imo so you should get the one you think you play better or you‚Äôre more comfortable with.. I‚Äôd go for crow first since you can use him in many maps and poke other brawlers.. you‚Äôll have poison plus weakened opponents
---
I got my Rosa to rank 10 the day I got it so, yes, Rosa's trophies are very free

I pushed her rank 20 in duo. She is very good, especially with drink modifier.

Both are good, but Barley's is in a whole different level, one of the best SP in the game by far. In Gem Grab, Heist and Siege it's a real game changer. So unless you REALLY only play Showdown and prefer Crow, I'd get Barley's first. With Crow you can get a little more aggressive which is good, but with Barley you can push and zone far more efficiently and that will help your teammates too.
---
You don't know what they're into

Jk

Only Tara, the rest are the legendaries I will never ever get

Thats just wrong

I took this screenshot yesterday before I bought the skin for 80 gems.  For real?

i once had 250 viewers. and it was a disaster. my whole team consisted of power 7s and 8s (including myself) while the enemy team had 3 power 10 players rushing down our safe in heist.
---
why thank you! &lt;3
---
You just said you're actively not playing 85% of the roster because you're afraid of losing trophies. If your endgame is to stop playing the game then you're doing a great job. Care about trophies if you want but again, what's the point in even having them that high if you don't play the game?
---
OH LOOK ANOTHER SKIN STEALER

Okay, well i am a little greedy, just waste my gems on skins that i get from free boxes from now on i will spend my gems on token doublers.

if it was different one, then idk what to say...

That's way too strong, pulling someone across means you are right next to the enemy at the end of your super meaning you can one shot them

I think that‚Äôs actually more of a nerf. The intent of bull‚Äôs super is to go through the enemy team not bring them with you, for instance, if you want to push in heist you don‚Äôt want to bring someone with you.

Lol reality these days

then feel free to put r/wooooosh ?

Then you are lucky. It doenst matter if you have 0.2% or 0.1%. The 0.1% difference is so small it doesnt even matter that much. You just have to be lucky.

If I have your consent then yep

I didn't get the joke, so I have to be r/wooooosh ed lol

Why don't the morti talk about mortis buff!?

except the fact bull's super is slow as shit you could easily move horizontally to them once he starts charging, its really just an escape tool.

Is Bull own a restaurant or something? If it is then that restaurant seems to futuristic
---
and yeah some of gedi kors skin may come too
---
this guy probably stole everything
---
So cute
---
Well half tickets and half on Doublers works well imo
---
Depends on the map. It's almost impossible on maps like Passage/Eye of the Storm but very feasible on Erratic Blocks/Rockstar Brawl/Dune Drift/Stormy Plains
---
Bo is looking at Mortis's creature of the night XD
---
What are the extra arms for?
---
That‚Äôs not exploit. That‚Äôs enemy team being dumb and MORTIS being lucky he didn‚Äôt fought against other tank/range brawlers.
---
# NO
---
Where?
---
living legend
---
Yes, thx
---
Thank you for linking my guide in these btw (not sure if I said this already lol)!
---
Cards...
---
Token doublers. why?
---
One token doubler = 20 boxes
---
One mega box = 10 boxes
---
Mega box is 80 gems. Token doubler is 50 gems. So basically you're getting a 110 gem profit by buying one token doubler than buying two mega boxes.
---
AND all boxes have the same brawler rarity. And token doublers give you the 20 boxes piece by piece. but mega box is one box that have the same loot as 10 boxes, EXCEPT for the chance of getting more brawlers. meaning you have a higher chance of getting a new brawler when buying a token doubler. So buying token doublers is much much more profitable than buying boxes.
---
I know this is a joke but eh.
---

---
It's not that tough if enemies are grouped together (in 3v3) and u can do that in solo or duo also if u can aim properly instead of auto-aiming 
---
I have managed to rush inside 3 ppl in siege decreasing their health to almost 10% and then died but I got my super back and my team-mate, Gene killed 2 of them easily but third one went back but it gave us good mid control and we won
---
I don't exactly remember how did I use my super in SD cuz it was long ago but he is definitely a good brawler and this would make his super better (which is one of the worst supers in my opinion)

I know but at high trophies, he can't do anything much against long range brawlers cuz they won't let him come near them and even if he manages to run through them using super, they will get only 1k damage and then they will shoot him from sar and kill him easily
---
And his super is actually one of the worst supers in my opinion (it's useless in most of the situations if ur enemy knows ur position)
---
THE SPRITS CALL MY NAME
---
You

Maybe but his super definitely needs to be improved cuz it's one of the worst supers in the game

I honestly think autoaim is a nerf. So many people just spam it and it makes it easy to dodge people. Obviously it's harder against bull but it's still doable.

hmm.. im loving this new poco buff.

And *that fucking Colt*

Yeah I honestly don't get all the jizz about buffing him.. he is mad anoying in chipdamage and his flying ability quite OP in my opinion

It says (remodel) so he disn't claim it for himself

Sorry for the wrong one

I like it but I think it should only pull one person, and maybe if it does start to pull someone, it‚Äôs range would then be decreased?

That ones pretty bad too but siege is much more unbalanced and you lose way too many trophies

I was expecting that Dio would be the Sniper bot

Where‚Äôs the hat?

4,4k, not even a single mythic yet
---
So, you think if you don't get one of the rarest thing in the game, it's not fun? You do realize you have tons of other brawlers, which are equally as fun to play as, right? You don't NEED a Legendary Brawler to have fun. You can play as literally any other brawler and have just as much fun as if you WERE playing as a Legendary Brawler. Maybe you should think about how chances work before you complain to Supercell about absolute RNG.

Well i like bounty a lot so
---
She is pretty weak as a big brawler. We kill her most of the time in 1:33
---
Omg that is awesome. I really wanted a brawler that has some futuristic feature such as teleportation or time traveling. It is just a hint tho so can‚Äôt get my hopes too high
---
I feel like it's too huge...

What is the max level?

It's not that hard with randoms if the map is open.
---
It was months ago, I think it was in the news tab? I forget
---
I asked him for using the :v.It‚Äôs common in Spanish speaker countries
---
Yes, that was intentional but I can change it. Thanks for letting me know though.
---
Again. Next ballance changes for sure. I want the DMG reduction nerf. Down to 50%. I don't care about the duration
---
I got 9/10 wins in siege with piper and randoms and mvo every game. It all depends on the map. Bot drop, the map of last weekend was insane for her for example. In other maps is useless ofc
---
Oh well at least I tried xD

*GEOLOGY ROCKS*
---
Yes I was thinking about a super since the begining of the duel or something to have the super quickly as you was thinking because primo would be penalize if he can‚Äôt attak the ennemy so I hope supercell will see it and help us
---
Thats actually how I somehow got her from 460 to 500 (I was her)
---
I made it to 5000 an hour ago. Congrats anyway
---
80s-90s? I think that's a little wrong
---
That's a 50s-60s era restaurant/diner
---
Which makes sense with bull's pompadour.
---
Even the cars in game are really vintage in their aesthetic.
---
Might see more things with rockabilly Mort.
---
I hope piper or tara get a remodel and we get a Betty skin for either of them.
---
Rosa
---
See the thing is with this map you should play a long range brawler if you want to win, or you could use Darryl due to his rolling across water ability
---
Maybe because you are just bad? It is not hard to kill a rosa. There is something called staying far away or if you are a heavyweight having the rosa chase you in a way so that only you can hit the rosa

---
Wait.. He has dead ringer
---
Tbh if rosa gets slowed down she would be the most underwhelming brawler in the game, mainly because she would be unable to catch up with long range brawlers. I‚Äôd say lower her range a little bit instead.
---
That Primo model was never in game though
---
Yeah but IMO the glasses makes the meme funnier
---
Hehehehe
---
There would be none.  Leon has brown skin, my friend.   For it to be NOT brown, means someone consciously chose to wash it pale.  
---
As usual.

You should FTFY and add the glasses then (:

The makes me angry and sad at the same time
---
prefer the Frank version if this
---
Maybe less earrape. Otherwise nice editing though!
---
Is this a genjutsu or is it the mangkeyo of itachi???
---
Yes, I also tried that, but since it doesn't make much sense, I didn't try to answer this guy.
---
üíéüíéüíéüëåüëåüòÇüòÖüòÖ
---
Super
---
Very true! Haha
---
Great idea,but unpractical in the case the whole team is at the right and bolts start spawning in the other side. We need a map where we have free mobility.
---
Yes,i saw the jump pads,but they barely take you to the middle of the map and you need to wait for it to activate.
---
actually there's portuguese AND brazilian portuguese
---
idk the difference but they are different
---
I... I did not expect this post to get so many upvotes. Thank you
---

thank you! üíù

"Yo whats the scoop?"
---
"Penis"

*proceeds to crash *
---
Remember when supercell said that they're fine with teaming?
---
It could be a place where, like global chat, u could hang out
---
5 spikes
---
*rico the invader
---
Every day a letter is added?
---
Pat's
---
It's his drawing, his idea, he can do it as he likes. Other skins in the game do this too.
---
Evolution; it must have passed you by!
---
Bunny Penny is better
---
Plus its 80's themed, and what did back in the future had? HOVERBOARD
---
this is a rage comic
---
i can tel because the way it was done is the same and it has a rage comic character.
---
rage comics belong in 2011, not 2019.
---
you also said lol with a crying with laughter emoji, which is even less funny or cool than the meme.
---
hope this helps you improve your memes in the future :)
---
You tried to make a jojoke but there are no Stands!! o.O
---
That would be cancer... Rosa or death :/
---
Nice connection üëå
---
I think they'er going to add sparcly lighted map or a new enviroment?
---
A creature of the nighty boi
---
Mortis ganggg
---
I can confirm its new gem grab map with minecart if you pause the video at the perfect time you will see gems inside colt minecart
---
What do you think Supercell ID is for anyways? Of course it saves your progress.
---
Maybe
---
Yeah we get about a brawler a month, so that would be slow but maybe a new direction. Time traveller brawler would be awesome, or like a teleporter.
---
Yeah i feel bad for the one in the corner up-right. Optimize it?
---
Everybody gangsta in siege until the turret brawlers‚Äô super ring goes yellow
---
New pub with quests And wanted players, like in Shakes And Fidget
---
Thanks!

Just had Barley in brawlball who got star player. But to be honest enemies were shitty.
---
why not both
---
I like the new center gem mine. Makes it unique like the minecarts map.
---
This isn't the original post ;S
---
Yep
---
Lol i am at 4k trophies and got 23 brawlers
---
1 tile gaps are a problem.
---
but the matchmaking is near perfect
---
Gene grabs them.
---
Wut
---
And i think its new big boss map with minecart look at the logo on the bull's restaurant
---
I think you should otherwise the other person would take advantage of it and you would lose
---
i think the theme could be cyberpunk wild west while being located on the 50s
---
battlepass theme?
---
Nice jukes.
---
Attention all brawl stars gamers: Colt needs your help. He‚Äôs stuck in the middle of Erratic Blocks with all bushes intact, and it‚Äôs just him and a power 17 Rosa. Colt just needs to win this game to get to Rank 20, or he may never see the glory of the leaderboards. All we need is your credit card information and the three numbers on the back so we can buy him some power cubes. Hurry, so Colt can reach the epic Victory Royal!
---
r/LootStars.
---
NoT tHE FaCE
---
Only the Brasil brawlers can reveal
---
I love how the community focuses on the important issues /s.
---
Petition on banning brawlers for match
---
They already removed Cavern Churn and Island Invasion.
---
Bull and Rockstar Colt will be important
---
I mean atleast the guy admitted its not his and he posted it cause it looked cool
---
Have mercy on his soul
---
Yes if rosa has his super but without it would be ok
---
20 powercube Poco appears
---
Welcome to a bush! Can I kill u now?
---
Bo: Its Mine Zone so stay away from our lands.
---
Amaaaazing art :)
---
Why Penny is so small in the first case.
---
Thank you
---
Also for 3v3, especially Siege (:

---
Haha thank you! Remember:
---
#BUFF MORTIS
---
no one the both are for mortis
---
With randoms you can never be too sure that they know
---
You only have to give credit to the person who came up with the idea, I know you made the art and you dit it well but you have to give credit to the person who thought of the idea.
---
Nah fam someone requested it.
---
Either way, I will take that as a compliment.
---
It adds weight to the mesaage, ey?
---
It is showdown mod!
---
Ye
---
Ohhh... Nah nah, my name is Athena.
---
O SAM √â BRABOR BRO üòÇüëåüëå
---
Oooo, story mode! That sounds cool
---
Speaking of story mode, I think they should Incorporate story mode into boss fight or something like it. Thoughts?
---
[BRAWL STARS] DYNAMIKE &amp; CARL - THE MINING TEAM...üòé

[CLASH OF CLANS] MINER - LONELY...üò¢
---
Hold on! If you look in the background that's almost Modern Day, and the Neon lights everywhere... I know exactly what's going on here! The Game is getting an Era change, from the West to The 60's NeonMixTapeTour!
---
I understand. But I just don't know who else came up with it before me is all I'm saying
---
There are little entry points at the side but could edit it to where there is one in the middle
---
Yeaaahhhhhhh! ü§ò
---
Gg, I‚Äôve been playing since global release and I only have 2 star powers at 7300
---
Lol you think I wanted a sorry? I simply wanted constructive criticism, not childish comments like this.
---
Tell me how my art went down hill, I think each piece I‚Äôm improving in terms of highlights and shadows.
---
nothing really, it‚Äôs more for privacy reasons
---
Oh okay, well the person who has it to the right made the idea :)
---
Thank you!
---
how many spins for invisible Leon call?
---
that‚Äôd be awesome! tysm, i can pm u my friend link?
---
Rico: past the ball.
---
Me: that's rare!
---
Well honestly he is the one with the slowest reload time and plus a small range.
---
Looks like someone tilted a couple trophies by trying to get that star token
---
Whatever floats your boat
---
True
---
Thank you! And now you said that, I am waiting for Poco to sing Wonderwall.
---
ok got it! thank you!!!
---

*Old Cob disapproves this map*
---
Happened to me twice, I won tho thank god
---
Thank you. I just feel weird hearing my voice when I speak. I think it is a bit too low.
---
Want me to post the original to the right and show it's an El Primo concept with the Colt concept for when the game was ( I believe) in the beta phase?
---
If Brawl Stars ever implements lore, Leon will be a ~~yiff addict~~ **furry art enthusiast**
---
You're welcome! Glad to be in service!
---
Red riding hood Nita and her wolf. Seen that on this sub before
---
There should be a day for brawler concepts
---
Jessie's stand: scrappy
---
Penny-uhhh motar
---
Pam-healing thingy
---
Nita-bear
---
Tara-black portal tara clone
---
Also stands can be guns
---
Got my vote. ‚ÄòBout to get my homies to upvote this too.
---
I‚Äôve searched for it but couldn‚Äôt find anything on what the chances are for each rarity per box
---
Wow, that's really nice of you! I didn't expect anyone to actually replay
---
:D
---
A shoutout would be awesome thank you so much my man! 
---
I wish you all the best &lt;3
---
Cute :3
---
Deeemn that chin
---

---
I think poco is worce
---
Some of those might be describing a new brawler
---
HXJJS DON'T WORRY OUR STYLES LOOK SO SIMILAR AT THE END
---
Also same but with a translator and a little patience you can go pretty far ^^
---

---
Yeah but no, Minecraft commands don‚Äôt contains #numbers or @mentions
---
As a Darryl main I can confirm that this is accurate
---
Really good low effort post 10/10 ign
---
Wooshes are supposed to be for good/simple jokes. This is neither
---
Nice name
---
Only if changing someone's character were so easy
---
Its a lag issue. Try going to the settings and disable lock controls so you can have more freedom.
---
Yes I'd would like some sugar because I am gonna need it to make muffins

This is all my map ideas (3 of them)
---
Colt is new, so Poco spins around (during the fight scene, along with colt) and he explains what‚Äôs going on. Then they fight the next showdown after the 15 second showdown respawn.
---
Then the fire nation rocked it
---
GiVE ME MeaNingLesS InTerNeT pOINts!!!

Passage could be pretty good but because of al the teaming its such a mess...

Doge bear, watch out there‚Äôs a Nita behind you! OH SHIT HE‚ÄôS WEARING AIRPODS HE CANT HEAR US!!
---
A yes. Poco skin color
---
Lmao remove big drink, it removes skill
---
Kids watch where you super
---
Agreed, but because of all the teaming I left it alone in F
---
People who know the reference shut
---
En primer lugar, no dije que fuera mi idea solo dije que me gustaria. Logicamente existen miles de juegos que emplean esta misma tematica, no seas tan rata "no es una idea original" y en segundo, muestrame el post de spiuk y veremos ya que como te digo, la idea no es original, ni spiuk ni yo fuimos los primeros ¬øentiendes o no?...
---
Thanks Taicho, I hope you make a comeback soonüòâ. And Please Give Matsumoto a Bankai.

#MOM TURN ON THE VCR I'M FAMOUS

If you look at Gene in a way, he kind of resembles Jevil from Deltarune
---
Of course
---
nEgATivE CommENt! Nice map! Tone down the bushes a bit, even tho its a rainforest
---
Colt took the wrong rails while stealing Carl‚Äôs cart. Now he owes bull a lot of money. XD (please don‚Äôt hate)
