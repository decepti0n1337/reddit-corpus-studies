Legendary are the most unique. Crow has poison. Spike has a cactus grenade that shoots out spikes.
---
Leon can become invisible and kill people. Unlike trophie road brawlers who use a shotgun or just shoots in a straight line
---
Sometimes sorting by new is not a bad thing! Well done OP, it looks awesome!
---
"He just got clapped and he's coming back for more" -wonderbrad
---
Lol anyone could have their name at kairostimeyt
---
Crow is too map dependent. Leon isn't
---
No one's fucking complaining
---
Dang, thank you very much!
---
Spike is the best IMO
---
Nah, what I say is true, you don‚Äôt even need boxes you just have to have money to get good in the game, supercell is bullshit I love their games but they just care about money
---
Bruh
---
Why is there no airborne El Primo (you know the joke)
---
I do 3 in gg to get all the gems in one person
---
and saying he only had 450 trophies i highly doubt it
---
Dude you're acting like you've never used Leon. Try using him in any open showdown map at 500 trophies and hope you don't get sniped by the 4 pipers hiding in the bushes.
---
Nice
---
WHAT?
---
I laughted way too hard for this.
---
Well, Supercell confirmed that they're working on an El Primo remodel right now.
---
Yeah and I still feel dirty cause of it :(
---
Ha this is great. I love the explosion and everything, all I would offer as critique is piper looks really realistic and it‚Äôs kinda weird, and Jessie looks too blurry but overall very cool
---
Amazing

thanks to everyone for being so nice!

That was a rollercoaster of emotions and I am glad it ended on a good note. Holy crap Supercell needs to do something about teamers.

No not .13 but 1.3

I would add a bit more walls

I have 8.6, missing Gene and legendaries
---
happened to me as well
---
General Reposti
---
tru
---
I don't want to belive that. How many trphies and legendaries?
---
So what happened here is that they hit each other with their ults,totally obliterating each other
---
Just got 1, or new player?
---
wen I caught the Shelly was still behind the line
---
I like it but I think it needs more boxes on the right and left
---
Now i'm curious! Hahah
---
The campers are more toxic...!
---
Tell me, how the fudge do you do that
---
12,000 and all legendaries amd has them since about 9,500 since I got the last one
---
Hahahah Agreed!
---
Here is some quick feedback: 
---
\- There is too much grass on this map (it will be as cancerous as the Eye of the Storm). Keep everything prorpotional (equal amounts of walls, grass, etc)
---
\- Most of the wall structures aren't as unique as other maps. Try making unique block structures (apart from other maps)
---
\-  Remove some of the 1 tile walls in some areas of the map
---
\- Try adding structures on the edges of the map
---
\- Try fixing some of the box placements. This is one of the key points for gameplay (especially for the beginning of the game). Try having some 2-boxes, or boxes players can fight for instead of free boxes, but this is up to you =)
---
I had one that took 15 seconds
---
Shortest match is 17 seconds
---
He used the jump button obviously
---
The game ended right as I got hit by an enemy Bo's mine and it bounced me onto the air and kept me there
---
Maybe he fought Dinamike who threw super and finished like that?
---
Shelly wouldve gotten it

You don‚Äôt get that if everyone‚Äôs lagging, some of them have to have GOOD WIFI. So therefore it‚Äôs Supercells fault and your just delusional to think more laggers means less chance it‚Äôs supercell fault.
---
DJ Khaled!
---
Oof I feel u man
---
Shelly, Bull and Darryl's buck shots, Pam's Scrap Storm, Mortis's shovel (don't think it has a face), Nita's shock wave, Piper's sniper shot, Frank's attack, Gene's fireballs (excluding the lamp), Bo's normal attack, Mike's dynamites and so many.
---
Loool
---
have you ever tried Shocky he deals triple the damage
---
Idk, pam and jessie is definitely good
---
Ok so first of all how many people complain about lag it‚Äôs only this guy complaining because he has bad wifi

I can‚Äôt tell if the colt and primo were really cocky or just plain stupid

Underrated post

If this is in the game. I would actually pay money to buy gems
---
such wow. much observe
---
Yup, I know but it's frustrating
---
:D
---
I thought I was too but I saw people complaining about it on reddit
---
I played at school using ProtonVPN and bluestacks. Stonks
---
I think if you backstab them immediately then its legal. But if you wait until the team grows big and only few players are left... then technically you are dirtier than a teamer and an actual teamer.
---
Supercell can. Of course they can. If they implemented a report function and banned teaming, which means fixed period bans for players that team, it would stop. 
---
But they won‚Äôt. Supercell even admitted in one video that half of their staff don‚Äôt even think it‚Äôs cheating, which it is. Some people just don‚Äôt mind douchebag behaviour in online games (probably because they do things like that themselves).
---
Cause 1% is 1/100
---
1/100 x 1/100= 0.0001
---
How wasn‚Äôt he teaming? The Nita walked right past him.
---
Ok, I still haven't studied this at school

Haha but if u get 2 legendary in a row. Bro you must go for the lottery.

Thanks for your art post! If you are not the creator of this work, please make sure that you have included the source, or to  comment it here! Unsourced art may be removed if you are not the creator.
---
Teaming is cheating, plain and simple. Satisfying to see them all lose because of it. In showdown there is no reason why you wouldn‚Äôt be trying to at least avoid each other.
---
I‚Äôve killed multiple teamers before, usually do it nice and early when I see the spinning. Another satisfying thing to do is kill people who have been tempted to chase after the robot in that showdown map, thinking they can steal the cubes and/or kill you.
---
Nice!
---
This... isn‚Äôt yours. It‚Äôs in the game files, ya know.
---
## bruh üòéüíØüíØü§°üëè
---
But it will be cool if it was in the Game
---
Yeah, Supercell fixed the bug, when the game randomly crashes out, but brought another one, the ,,you can't move if you want to" bug.
---
I hate it too!
---
Reeeeeee
---
R e e e e p o s t
---
Avocado
---
Stop steeling !!!!!!
---
It is not xD
---
Every cube gives 25% more
---
So if you have 10, 250x
---
That is 3,5 more powerful
---
Yeaa I feel you. Just not enough hp or damage at this point.
---
Really lucky man....my friend takes the same so sad
---
My legendary chance was 0.06 and I got spike and now it's at 0.0144
---
Bibi is my favourite brawler, but I'm not a fan of most of her skin ideas. This one is my favourite so far! Good job on it -3-b
---
That Robo rumble isn't the next ticketed event
---
It was a cool update rip update
---
Those Poco feels... go to mid, get fired by six players trying to rush mid, eat all the cubes, die and watch 12 cube Tara teammate just stare.
---
Now thats call a painting
---
Ma man. I tried it once and it didn't go so well. I salute you.
---
They are
---
Jessie can't do anything as a little brawler, and that kind of bothers me more.
---
Can you link me for the real one because im too lazy to search for it?
---
I know - nothing
---
***I really know nothing***
---
Nope, why should I care how others feel? Does it suck when I get teamed on and lose? Yes. But at the end of the day if you can‚Äôt beat em join em. You can whine all you ant but teaming is in the game and I‚Äôm going to use it.

Oops ! Ok!

Being maxed with all brawlers around 428 trophies automatically makes you bad

It gives him +10 Agility

Do not say this again ;-;

I didn‚Äôt say you had to be maxed or have 428 trophies to be bad. I just said spending money doesn‚Äôt make you automatically bad.

Turn all bushes to walls, and add maybe 5 bushes scattered around. Currently the map would get you killed due to camping Shelly‚Äôs with their alts is a hidden frank that stunned you from nowhere

oh wow

Oh? Now I get what you mean, but still, it doesn't work like that

Gone. Reduced to atoms.

if that happens on 3v3 the others that you are trying to push fast are going to be like 'come on press play again already what are u waiting forrr!!!11!!1'

Same I was around 900 trophies

I'm about to do the exact opposite of your exact opposite, then ill do the exact opposite of my exact opposite.

Pam so thicc that she isnt thicc

On the other side 8 thophy 8-bit

The first shot was aim because when the enemy is in a bush the auto-aim doesn't target them. After that it's auto aim tho

I am to exhausted to crosspost it on r/shittybrawlstars so i will be merciful today

Top left is my favorite. Have an upvote for your amazing ideas!
---
That's awesome! He's one of my favorites brawlers (crow's my boy) and whenever I don't wanna stress in a match I go Leon because of how chill and fun he is. Really easy to push, hard to master I'd say.
---
Thx. Im a leon main but his attacks are weird and hard to hit all if them. Bos are really good but leins attacks are fucked up
---
You should link the original
---
I just get triggered ESPECIALLY when my opponents are doing it

It feels like my lose is a bigger deal than it is
---
CaaC
---
Everyone ganster untill mega box starts talking....
---
Yeah all I was thinking was "don't check this bush" and thankfully they thought I went down. A few of those dodges were a mix of predictions on where they were gonna attack tho.
---
The dude who played in this game now hears only piper snipping shots and can only see in blue/pink
---
After I hit him he was still going the same way for a split second
---
I got 196 in solo
---
thanks mate
---
Get it? Because she's fat. Comedy gold my Sir. Take my downvote
---
How can he move tho
---
This does put a smile on my face.
---
stOP SHAKING THE DAMN CAMERA
---
I think there aren't any characters inside walls
---
Supercell would probably just make Brock‚Äôs rocket launcher into a mega box
---
This is better than a Disney story :,)
---
Gotta check that out now.
---
My personal preference sir
---
Poco's been rejected again... 
---
Look's like it'll will be a lonely Valentines for him
---
Yeah it can be hard. Especially since the attack starts at the left and takes a while to get to the right. Basically at range with any brawler always aim. At close range you wanna aim the first shot to get the enemy on screen. After that just follow their movements and if you can, go through their attacks (if it's Frank or something) and tap away.

This deserves a lot more upvotes

Fair point, I misunderstood you. But telling people to stop feeling anger towards teaming won‚Äôt do anything either. Why did you do it anyway?

crow is the toxic arene

Why? Also its friendly game and there is no chance ot will happen actually.

Wait is that shiiii....

80 gems

Sorry but it is very bad

Now throwers have no chance to win against mortis

And the damage buff is bad

Definitely get it it‚Äôs nearly a guaranteed brawler at your brawlers
---
It's name is offensive Oasis
---
Star points, the new ranks and having high trophies are all part of the end game. Having high trophies was the only end game up until the changes. The problem was that people were getting bored and burnt out with that old end game. I'm not saying high trophies is worth less than star points. They are different parts of the end game and the changes give players something else to do. From that perspective, I would say it is a good end game. Could it better? Probably but SC has already made one round of changes to star points and I'm sure there will be more to come.
---
If all you care about is max trophies and are trying to be as efficient as possible, then you are right, you will save time but 240 trophies from 10 brawlers? I just don't view it is a lot of trophies (it's only 1.3% of 18K for example) and I'd rather take the star points. To each his own.
---
Good talk by the way (seriously); sorry if I came off rude in previous comments. I just don't see it the same way and my initial reaction was "what is this guy thinking?" I'm trying to see it from your side but just not convinced. Plus at this point, I doubt either of us will switch viewpoints based on our arguments. Would have been interesting if more people commented to see what others think. Oh well. Cheers.

That's what you get for Auto-Aiming,Also,That wasn't so bad
---
RIGHT
---
It takes time to do it,also,Supercell doesn't check reddit literally every day
---
Nice! I just unlocked him a couple of days ago!
---
 They are SSHHIINNNYYY
---
Dude I'm damned with those players I'm not playing anymore
---
Spike has no voice
---
2 other modes would put it at every 3 weeks not every month....
---
Play showdown
---
Yes u did,its sakura,not sukura
---
Good idea
---
It could would if the super bomb did a lot less damage, like 50% damage. and the other comments about chaining stuns are also correct. they would have to change it so that it charges your next super less than normal if you get hits with it.
---
but i like the idea
---
Post on r/BrawlRecruit,That should be a good place
---
So brawlball is only 60% of the favorite for Kairos viewers, not the entire community.
---
Watch out for teaming tho

That's an IQ 1000 play man. I just unlocked Leon a few weeks ago. He's so tough to play IMO. Props to you!

Yeah good effort but I've had 54 before, I think the actual record is like 80 or something

Some People are afraid of clowns,mostly the children

A flex but a big one

This happens when you play while charging your phone.

"Simple geometry"

Good for u, thanks for pointing that!! Totally related to the post

People would spam reports for no reason,even if you limit it to 3 per day.Also,play with your friends,or showdown

What‚Äôs the bug?

beebee

????

Buff Mortis

---
Didn't wanna make the title too long
---
This bug has cost me own goals in brawl ball
---
Really cool skin but supercell probably wont add that because its copyrighted.
---
Snare a bear in a nutshell
---
15 from a big box
---
No it's not AbOuT sKiLl
---
You were with someone, talked to them, told them what to do, while OP had no way of talking to them.
---
Aaaand he died
---
Also is that 3x mega box offer worth it?
---
Thank YOU to making this amazing template)
---
A bit?
---
Yeah
---
Man have you been living under a rock for a week, they added mega boxes and big boxes as an end of season star point offer
---
Yea, it's been happening a lot to me.  End up dying like a nub.  Never happened before until the recent updates.
---
kinda off topic but iphones just get uglier and uglier every yearüòî
---
if the 8-bit player is good, piper will be hard... but yes, probably piper is a good choice
---
It means he got it from a box as a coincidence so supercell can't give legendary (I know I'm going trough the risk of getting whooooshed but idc)
---
Buy Star Points for Gems
---
Tbh I got Spike from a mega box on tuesday and Crow, from a mega box, too and on wednesday.
---
After that I bought Leon for about 150 gems in the shop. 
---
I did not buy the gems.
---
Ty, I'm able to read. But I mean about the winners.
---
Do duos showdown with him
---
Looks like feast of femine with some extra stpes
---
lol
---
RR&gt;all the tickets event        BIG GAME is un fair      BOSS FIGHT  is boring
---
Ohhh yeah, ohh baby a triple
---
They completely fucked the mode rotation over time
---
I said that so others wouldn't talk about how the drawings suck
---
i hope I‚Äôm not the only one who chooses jessie in big boss until im the boss so i can torture people
---
Why need atts when he is so good overall? Poco has weak stats but is actually really easy and good to play
---
^pssst #YOUR AWESOME
---
Im shaking
---
Gem grab is the worst mode for randoms because they always go for gems, even if someone else is the carrier. Then they die and give them to the other too.
---
Unfortunately, gem grab is also 24/7.
---
more like symmetrical double trouble with a beautiful look
---
God damn
---
Don‚Äôt worry friend
---
Good old days
---
Please. Would make the map somewhat bearable
---
UwU thanks :)
---
Star points are to celebrate skill, not luck or how much money your willing to put into the game so no, that would ruin one of the only things high trophy, free to play players have to brag about. Also then there would be heaps of gold media bos and crows when that skin is purely to brag about skill, not pay to win players
---
Mmm yes, my favourite YouTuber 'cArA SiM0n'
---
lmaoo my cousin got spike at 400 trophies life is unfair
---
Lol derp
---
I have 10 available, and .1728% chance to get a legendary and still nothing. :/
---
Bruh nice
---
Ah, so you are also a dollar.
---
no one cares if u think this is shit basic stuff. Just appreciate it, or say what u dont like. but saying shit basic stuff dont helps anyone.
---
BiBi best girl
---
Thought it was just my phone! Good to know
---
Leon has same speed as crow
---
God, i got to 0.165 aprox but then i got mortis xD so It dropped a lot. Btw, how do u choose a character icon for this subreddit?
---
bounty with energy drink&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
---
&gt;OK thank you
---
Thanks to you aswell. I myself didn't know this til I looked it up lol.
---
Thanks. :)
---
He definitely does. At first I thought tanks would be good against them, but considering most tanks are short range, 8-Bit destroys them. Getting up close is pretty much an easy death
---
Gold
---
Nice tits bro
---
i got 116 then 156 after it that means 272 tokens in 2 matches in a row ultra stonks
---
That was clean
---
Simple. Just push spike with you're friends.
---
We spelt the some thing
---
How much trophies do you need to start appearing on the broadcast ?
---
My favourite one as well :)
---
r/WOSH
---
hmmm ok
---
Same
---
YES, WE MUST PRASIE WOSH
---
Could be a great choice of Sp.
---
The morti tho xD
---
Yes
---
If you leave a poor Barley to defend the safe against a Primo that's kinda on you XD
---
Yeah, I miss it
---
That was me with freak auto aim :)
---
Lol don't autoaim with morti
---
I mean, sure. I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a big deal. Bounty and Heist could each make a good tutorial mode. In theory, Brawl Ball could work too because of how simple its rules are, but in practice the tactics are too in depth for it to be the default mode.
---
True, star shelly is quite a big flex tbh
---
R/woooooooosh
---
No Crow or Spike yet youngblood.

He attacc                                                                                    He ptotecc                                                                                       But most importantly                                                              He‚Äôs thicc
---
for my its when i am walking and my character start walking for  no reason i always lose in showdown because that
---
What is IKE
---
Yeah, I've lost many matches because of this bug. Before, I thought it was my screen.
---
It was available for everyone who had the game in 2018...after the global release
---
i hate it i lost many games because of this
---
I have the same problem even on pubg mobile wtf
---
You try doing that when your under pressure...
---
I have died so much because of this
---
Ooh, Brock is in A

---
I would battle here
---
If your gonna throw a fit abt it maybe dont follow the sub?
---
Omg, I thought it was just me. This bug is so annoying.
---
Lol when I was younger I could relate
---
When you hit all 3 shots with piper
---
Yea I do the same but these kids just complain abput his 2nd star power
---
Its a balanced star power
---
I feel less dumb when people think that Brawl Stars still has the wild west theme..
---
I'm now super jealous
---
I am the only android who actually loves that design
---
every brawler has his own area
---
r/TheBrawlStarsCactus
---
Exactly.
---
Woah, can someone link source pls! :D
---
Or is this reworked?
---
I didn‚Äôt know srgrafo crossed over to BS.
---
Any brawler that has a longer range than him absolutely obliterates him on a open map and throwers counter him pretty easily
---
Is this an intended durarara! joke or im just high
---
bruh tara in a day
---
He‚Äôs the best legendary enjoy it
---
Ayye u gonna complain now??
---
What the fuck is this subreddit lmao

r/okbrawlerretard

just AIM 4head
---
Idk but I'd change my name to do that
---
downvoted for teaming against me, rosa
---
Not even sp
---
disgusting
---
better than boss fight
---
NO and why is that exist O_o
---
Who remembers when gem grab had healing mushrooms
---
I dont know how to tell this but here it goes.it is for a compilation of stories best made into videos. I think the title should be 'Brawl Story'

Episode 1
---

Alarmed by this a person working on cemetary dacide to check it. Upon seeing what she was into, he(Mortis) decided to help her on condition that she bring dead people back. She agrees and continues her experiment while mortis starts to gather bodies. But on her experiment she forgets to create separate potions for plant and human. she is then invited by mortis in his lab inside cemetary. She walks inside and see a dead body on a table torn to pieces and stitched. She decide to give her potion a test and sprinkle the body with potion. On the side of body there is a potted plant of cacti and a crow trying to eat flesh of body. As her potion was spreading wind blows and the cacti came in contact with potion. The body(frank) comes to life. Both are happy that it is success. They both cheers like maniac. But then in the peripheral vision of rosa something is seen moving. She is alrmed and on closer inspection she notice that the cacti has moved from original place and out of its pot. The cacti has come to life.

When he comes near the cematory he realise the sound coming from inside the cematory. He sneaks into the cematory and see the light coming from a room. He quietly checks the room to discover that a dead body a cacti and a crow has been brought to life. While there he hears the girl telling she will never reveal the potion to world. He then hatches the plan to steal the potion to bring a robot to life to help him in the bar. Then rosa notices him and he runs away.

„Öã„Öã„Öã„Öã(it means hahaha)

That doesn‚Äôt matter, what matters is that the person got a leggy on their birthday
---
I‚Äôm sorry but this is so hard to watch I‚Äôm cringing so much
---
Happy birthday
---
Robo spike is in the restroom
---
My guy; Shark Leon, all Mecha Skins, Pink Piper. All of them (and some more that I can't remember right now) were inspired by the community. They are not going to add all of the community skins because they are programming a game, not just drawing them.
---
No this is an = sign and what you will see after it is your iq 
---
Sorry had to do it nah it‚Äôs just a dress design you can find it in real life sometimes
---
 That‚Äôs really cool did you make it?
---
U just had to play one more game
---
The best of feelings
---
Are those Tara‚Äôs cards?
---
Bruh how is Leon not fun to play with he can scare people so bad and he‚Äôs fast how could you not like him
---
They also play against the best players, so it‚Äôs fine
---
Wow
---
Jojo stand looking az
---
STONKS
---
This is not ok
---
Just kidding dude...
---
Nothing wrong with that, we are all friends here right? (I don‚Äôt team and want peace between our kinds)
---
I like that, but I think the supercell never see my post and your comment
---
Yea if they‚Äôre 8
---
Yeah, i see why it's hated. Too many pipers, and too much teaming in final circle
---
So many defeat because of this bug it didn't happened before, 
---
It happened after my game got updated with optional update which was supposed to fix it irony
---
MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA
---
Week 1: robo rumble 
---
Week 2: boss battle
---
Week 3: boss fight 
---
Week 4: robo rumble
---
Once a month = 12x a year
---
Every 3 weeks = 17-18x a year
---
While yes it falls on the 1st week and 4th week they're only 3 weeks apart. It might not seem like a big difference but that is 12x a year for once a month and 17x a year if you started the cycle with something not robo rumble and 18x if you started the year with robo rumble l.
---
No there Mortis‚Äôs
---
Idk i guess not, though I got gene probably 5 months after my last brawler via brawl box. But good luck to us finding Leon soonü§û
---
Good meme but you needed to get the blank format for it to have worked better
---
Cause I like rico
---
Didn't know he was famous outside Spanish Brawl stars community
---
Don't worry, I did it on your part
---
The reason why is he plays fortnite and no one likes a person that plays that game even brawl stars
---
Satire
---
Tbh, it is Chinese traditional holiday.
---
So this is what he turns into with his super
---
I really think that star power should be like dyna jump, if you have skill its op if you don't its trash rather than low skill cap sp
