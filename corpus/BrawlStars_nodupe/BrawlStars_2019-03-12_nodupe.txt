You should buy skins
---
---
---
5 boxes are nothing. You need 2100 boxes to max an account. Lets try this: You get 2 boxes a day from tokens, plus "3 boxes" every 2 days from star tokens. It will take you almost 600 days or almost 2 years of playing every day to max your account. This is taking into account all the tickets, gems, and token duplicators you will get from said boxes.
---

---
Do you think this sounds reasonable? 2 years of daily playing just to get to enjoy full gameplay?
---
I'm not gonna lie, I love being that third Shelly and wrapping up the remains of the fight.
---
He got Bo before the trophy road update, but not Dynamike.
---
I got spike from a free daily shop chest and didn’t know how rare that was at the time so I was like, “huh, that’s cool I guess.”
---
You know their is actually Jessie porn
---
r/punpatrol
---
Don’t have many skins in mind, I’ll think of it a bit more, thanks 👍
---
That’s nothing. Once I won a brawl ball game in 20 seconds.
---
...I still don't get it
---
Best Brawl Stars meme I've seen 😂
---
No, some big company hire concept artist. I have been in the video game industry for over 10 years now ( not as concept artist ;)) but it’s prety common to see some Concept artist position. (And yeah no formation are required, just a hugeeee talent :) )
---
Sniper and assassin meta regarding gem grab and brawl ball maybe. Shelly still dominates most solo showdown maps
---
Yes. You can pull brawlers in Boxes, but you cnat get skins 😉
---
That‘s true. Right now at around 3k pretty much everyone plays bo lol
---
You: *doesnt have dynamike but has bo*
---
Trophy road system: Am I a joke to you 
---
Yea very true 😂 I’ll probably do that, thanks 
---
No 
---
Or dynamike
---
Or bo (im like 90% sure his bombs break bushes I could be wrong tho)
---
I, a professional Minecraft Linguist, have found some errors in your comment and have recrafted it. 
---
 &gt;or dynamike

It's allowed by SuperCell currently.

Just play Mortis and wreck them all.
---
I like how the Shelly at the end still tried to team with Leon 
---
Power level doesn’t matter so much , and I m sure ppl won’t hv one or two brawlers over power 5 and remaining power 2 lmao . But yeah it’s good to push one brawler to reach ur target cuz like u adapt it, but better not push a single brawler too far from ur other brawlers.. U will likely to face opponents tht are much better (more experience )than u , and tilt ... 
---

That’s some bad luck. I just got both frank and spike in a week. It’d been about a month before that. 
---
Only need the other 2 legendaries to finish the collection 
---
Full disclosure: I have spent money on gems but not an excessive amount (mostly when there’s a really good limited time deal) 
---
yep xD
---
It would not be humor. There are so many posts “I have 10k trophies I deserve Leon this noob is trash I want leon”. It’s definitely a whiney post. And your logic about the attack is utter bs. He called an innocent person an idiot. Why can’t we call him an idiot back?
---
Sorry bro. Good concept, only it would play like hepatitis B.
---
My highest from one game is 800 something, could have got exactly 1,000 from one game but i was so dumb i clicked the wrong button smh lmao
---
He is perfectly balanced as everything should be
---
Use your mobility to not get  hit while chipping away their hp with max range attacks. Close in for the kill when they are low enoufh by jumping on them and quickly normal attack after for the 3 hit burts. Do not give the enemy the opportunity to regenerate by retagging them with poison. If they retreat further to regen you get more map control and more pressure.
---
Safest way to chip their hp without getting hit is by using walls, slight peak, normal attack and back behind the wall. Crow is really good at bounty and duo showdown.
---
Flexing those 300 coins I see
---
I don't have Mortis because my luck is terrible 
---
Read the rules!
---
This is actually a well designed and thought-out map. Nice!
---
Because of teaming hahaha! People spin meaning they want to team. (Dynamikes have a history of teaming)
---
#N O  I C E
---
Happen all the time ... I m at 9.5 k always match with ppl below 3k and face ppl at my trophies range and sometimes 11k+. Super frustrating 
---
I keep a standard level to all of my brawlers to 15 and then I can use them. I pushed my colt to 16 because Dune Drift came out and thats a great map, but I would stay at 15 until all my guys are 15 and then I can push for the feel of things.
---
Couldn’t agree more

I won 1 game of siege in total and lost since then. I don’t even play it anymore

Shelly still dominates showdown only in lower trophies. After 3k using Shelly in showdown is a bit nasty with the recent long and really open maps introduced in showdown
---
Laughs in darryl
---
Wait did the season really end?
---
Carl got a job but can't seen to control the mine cart at times
---
....?????? you aren’t meant to use the super to pull a close range brawler in the first place UNLESS they are either: 
---
a. low on health
---
b. out of ammo
---
c. no super + one of those conditions
---
this applies for when ur pulling a gem carrier like poco too, and usually you pull when your teammates are surrounding you and they’re able to kill the person you pulled 
---
his super is awesome for changing the game drastically in modes like gem grab and bounty, and it’s amazing for pulling the robot or players with bolts in siege 
---
not every super has to do damage to be good 
---
LEON must die
---
Iria dar o mesmo problema do mapa pool party por causa das águas 
---
Dynamike a miner he got gems
---
Nice
---
hmmm...

Get out of here with your crap

I don't see why not

He got dynamike off a brawl box when you're only supposed to unlock him on trophy road.

---
Should have proposed this to supercell before CNY 
---
yeah this is bad but what’s worse is your 6 unread messages
---
Same man, 2 and a half here and still counting
---
Yes
---
Why Molt is allowed to play Supercell games is beyond me. Dude sits there and trashes on them when he gets bored of them then suddenly is into them again when an update comes out.
---
Should be reversed...
---
Colt is much more feminine 
---
That is very untrue. Shelley is one of the easiest brawlers to play, she counters a ton of the brawlers in the game, has CC, and threatens people out of her area just by being there. 
---
She deletes primo, mortis, darryl, bull, can’t be pulled by gene, can’t be dove by Darryl or bull or primo can interrupt supers like barley brock frank etc. Shelley is one of the best brawlers in this meta right now. 
---
By the way before you decide to argue with me I’m a pro player and league admin at PBL so don’t bother. 
---
Omg
---
That’s a flat out lie coming from a 12K player with ~1500 solo wins
---
I read this in his voice 
---
Also the brock may just be really bad...
---
this is ADORABLE 
---
Ola I am Roberto, I love his game and I would like to recommend a skin for Frank as a builder Frank and a brawler that is cold temperament well that is my idea greetings BRAWL
---
Clearly you lack creativity, enough said. 
---
Lol me last night
---
Supercell needs money
---
He was available then I logged off. You think it's my job to verify the code consistency every time I log in? On I game i've spent hundreds on? I really fucking hate people like you. 
---
Should I do that or wait and get max crow?
---
Mexican
---
Maybe it would be cool if the maps where random so like one match you will play thousand lakes and then the next cavern churn. 
---
I'm glad you liked it. I did my best with the design and art but still, it's your idea. Did it to help out or I wouldn't have drawn it otherwise :p
---
Lmfao Hundreds?😂😂 You aren’t mad about that? 💀
---
I always wanted to see them without the cartoon outline. Thanks :)
---
There are only a handful of brawlers who are actually any good on siege, it is the most team comp intensive mode. 
---
A quick guide on how to choose a brawler to play on siege. 
---
Is this brawler a tank? If so, do not play on siege. 
---
does this brawler have slow reload time? If so, do not play on siege. 
---
That leaves you with... 7 or so brawlers that are actually any good.
---
These rules are not true if you are playing in a group, only when queuing for randoms. 
---
Sorry about that, I'll what time I need on these things from here on out.
---
I was today years old
---
Já estou escolhendo meu bull 
---
It still looks awesome 
---
When siege first came out I decided to use my Leon (rank 15 at the time) and got a got random team and kept hitting play again until I had to do something but had him rank 18. A few hours later and I decide to play Leon in swigs again, drop back down to 340 before giving up. I’m still like 20 trophies away from getting back to rank 18 but I guess I don’t use him often
---
You’re prob garbage 
---
Yes. He is very good

New Brawl Ball Map: Grass Ball

https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/b022v8/new_map/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
This one is one of my best maps, an old concept, but still good! Thank you!
---
don’t you mean penny?
---
Man I’m playing mortis and I’ve haven’t gotten him rank up (lvl2) and he doesn’t do any damage, I love playing him since he’s really mechanical, I’m able to make some sick plays, I wished he can attack faster and a bit of movement speed in bushes, feel like those changes will make him more valuable. So RICO ain’t the only one that need some fixing.
---
Ayo fun police, go away.
---
Thats what they all say. Im putting you into the Brawl Stars slammer. Your roommate is a 20 gem carrying El primo.
---
I like the concept of making each big square different so you have to adjust your strategy based on your spawn/where u are on the map more than other showdown maps, but basically only throwers work on the map.
---
Time to Move to the boom box groove
---
I’d love this but should be a lower drop rate than even Legendaries I’m thinking.

Bro max crow ain’t worth, definitely go with Bo

---
I was thinking about this. How would they make money. Lol
---
Ok thanks, just gotta get a couple more gems and I can buy the points
---
WHAM BAM HERE COMES PAM
---
While I don’t think he’s shit, I feel like his range is to be questioned. He’s my least used brawler. I loved him when I got him but when I got him to rank 15, I stopped using him entirely. Don’t think he needs a huge buff tho maybe just a tad bit more bounce range or maybe a bump to fire rate
---
O no

Man just buy the 30 gem,”IF” you can.

i pushed mortis to 180 trophies at lvl 1 lmfao hes god tier on some solo shpwdown maps
---
I wished people I queue with aka randoms play like what your guide listed.
---
i got exposed 
---
Getting crow to level 9 is a nice bump but I’d rather max bo first as he hits really hard if you can land your shots
---

Pam really needs a Ghostbusters skin. That’s all I want.

this is what you see in sleep paralysis

your trophy’s what? what possession does your trophy own that you’re trying to get back?
---
Thank you so much! This helps a lot. The map submission post is actually what drove me to make this post. I'd like to make some maps and hopefully see them in the game :)
---
It should have been brock instead of colt
---
with the star powers (and even without in come cases) he can shoot further than colt, and around angles with similar damage. he's pretty strong if you use him right.
---
That buff was the little nudge you needed to get to 500
---
I have checked your maps and upvoted some of them! Apparently, there are a ton of 1-tile gaps ij most of your maps which means chunky brawlers, such as Pam or Bull can't fit.

He is a one man team

crow is antman

Thank you

That’s how to game has been, when Leon gets hurt, anyone can see him.
---
My friend said he gets a loot box from his club every so often, does that happen?
---
Couldn’t agree with this more.
---
Nick and Molt are the iconic duo for all the supercell games, when I would think of youtubers these two would be the first two with pat being third. If it weren’t for them I probably wouldn’t have gotten into stuff like boom beach and clash royale.
---
I just got crow at around 2300 trophies. I can already tell that it’s going to be ages until I get my next one. I’m thinking of just saving up my gems for a year and waiting for one to go on sale again.

No problem, just putting the credits here, after all, images and art like these appear so repeatedly in Google and most are without the names of the creators, at least you searched and posted here for someone to give the credits.

Nick and Molt, the duo for supercell and their games in general.

Lex and Kairos are the duo Brawl Stars.

Please Supercell Nerf Pam

Do a crow 👍
---
he stole the original Carl's eyes

Or standing opposite of dynamike
---
Crow doesn't need the buff... he deserves it. 
---
Due to their mechanics, Spike and Leon are very hard to nerf, with crow the only problem was his super.
---
This is a fan map, if I knew how to send maps to developers, it would be better, I will take into account your comment next time.)
---
*this is to good*
---
Dude same here. I also have every brawler except The ones you dont have. But the difference is that i am at 4.5k and I have star power Bo, Darryl, Shelly, Mortis and Poco.
---
So now it feels boring without a new brawler
---
skull creek is the best map bc its so easy to take out teamers and it feels good
---
cringe
---
"super juice" lmao
---
No please no! That will reduce my chances of getting that f\*\*\*\*ng legendary tremendously
---
I've played for about 9 months, and I got my first legendary last month. I still don't have any mythics
---
I have 4 brawlers at power 7 and the rest are at 6.

~~Also, re-reading what I said, it sounds that I’m complaining that I’m unlucky when I mean that I can see and sympathize with others who aren’t as fortunate as me~~.

Let's all agree that we all hate fidget spinners because THAT'S where all teamers got their interest in teaming.

“I’m magnificent :D”

Sorry but I don't know Spanish, I'm studying tho 😉

I haven’t got a legendary for 6 months, from July (Frank) to January (Leon and Spike)

Even without the StarPower? It is really fun to play him and I really wanna agree but...Its really painful to play with him without starpower now, I am sure u understand that pain too. 
---
Btw each time when I roll in and got my kill with Darryl, i would sing "they see me rollin, they hatin" in order help me keep playing Darryl, all the hard work paid off right at that moment.

Wow I’m literally in clas right now and should be making homework

Oh yeah true

That's completely wrong... I'd say every brawler is viable on siege, it all depends on how well you play 
---
Exactly lol
---
Ooh that’s hot. That’s hot.
---
I think it would work better if there were just box exclusive skins, not the ones people spend gems on.
---
IKR. But the poor guy's got nobody to queue with, since nobody is on his 950 level, but... innocent 400 trophy players? Really?

Hi Carl!

Once again, this game is making me waste so much time on just trying to get the star token by matching my low leveled team against higher leveled players. https://imgur.com/gallery/DRTgY17

I am 7.2k and still no legendaries

Make him a 300 Gem skin and Supercell might think about it

I was today years old..

Thank God
---
Erm...sometime u will get it maybe this month?
---
You have spike and you still talk about balanced rewards?!?
---
I team with Morti when it comes to Dynamikes 
---
Nop, Dani said a bit later
---
Wait but in "No Time to Explain", Shelly was there before Colt and seemed to know more than him 🤔
---
Best ever
---
Yea that makes sense
---
People that don't team to kill the Teamers are the real clowns here,You're gonna die in the end trying to fight either way They'll just third party

He got 3 epics in one box:/

How can I post pics on r/Brawlstars ?

Every single SD matches...

I know. I'm just clarifying it.
---
Bought the level offers and stuff.. I don’t have anyone max at 6300 my biggest brawler is power 7 lol 
---
Okay so like Pam and Bull = Colt and Jessie,,Colt is against his own father?
---
oh never heard of this reddit Thanks !
---
I know and I have posed on other subreddit before. But in this subreddit, when I click post it says can't post picture
---
It's rewind time
---
Its too late my friend Time to say goodbye
---
It’s not that bad it’s potentially 40-80 tokens worth
---
Matchmaking seems super balanced here idk why you’re whining
---
Intersting subject i take note
---
Is 1k damage not enough? I think she is good as is lol
---
Lmao
---
Yeaaah!! 
---
How did you bypass idle warning?
---
Actually I am against for asking for free stuff all the time, or any time at all, 
---
However it would be nice to have a exclusive just for the best of the best, like 1000 trophies or 800+ on a single brawler
---
It would be almost impossible, but for those that acquire that, they deserve something special, regardless if they spend money or not.

Ahh, boxes not being retroactive. That's a good idea.

Why’d u try to push on a teamers map.....

You didnt really need to explain.
---
And this pic is like the piper perri one
---
Well there is no point in complaining about teaming cuz SuperCell doesn't give a fuck and they see it as a strategy so,Feelsbadman I get salty about Teamers too but there is nothing I can do other than Team to kill Teamers
---
You can't be overpowered if everyone is overpowered.
---
I ain’t gonna team with that shovel wielding creature.
---
IDK why you are being downvoted but you are 100% right.
---
Did you ever buy anything with real currency?
---
If yes then check which ever account you used. If no then I have no idea.
---
Getting Spike is a better feeling.
---
I agree

Me: Good idea

Supercell: f all of you. Im mr. Krabs and i need money. MONEY MONEY MONEY

Hehe, That's **noice**

From 0 to 8000 maybe

Isn't there a specific category for sponsoring? Or Don't sponsor at all
---
They must face off
---
Why do you advertise this to me, I'm the most active there, it's hard not to notice my posts
---
That can work 
---
You should max at least 1 so you can drop the 1% Starpower
---
Well it actually is... Sometimes.
---
Don’t forget the amount of trophies needed for each. Sure the power levels may be off, but Bull is achieved at 500 and Jessie is achieved at 1,000
---
All I do in Coc is farm and upgrade with barch. I dont like complex strategies, ita just a pass timer to me. Attack with barch, upgrade, repeat
---
From the game "Paper, please!"
---
It exists only on duos and 3v3.
---
As a Darryl you shouldn't Team,He is a big anti-teamer,You have disgraced my race
---
It's not just you. 😁
---
The thing is... I embrace it. Moat people, and especially younger people, are afraid to fully be themselves because of what they think others will think of them. I couldn't care less. I am 100% myself and if that's a bit "cringy" (totally overused word imo) then I'm totally cool with that. 
---
Actually, thats an L
---
Short for the L you took when you got destroyed by those 8 dynamikes.
---
Please buff Crow. I can't understand how he can be called legendary. I spent a lot of time on twitch waching pro players games and nobody plays with Crow. It's a pity. Absurd.

You always get the lose music in showdown if you don't win.

Oh. Thanks for the info.

Then why did u post here?
---
Why do i see mortis nibbas here only
---
I mean most of us probably work better with a full stomach. Unless it's so full that we vomit. Either that or Shelly vomits on her opponents as an attack. 
---
Stick a bullet in me, im done
---
Darn it sure is a pain when Shelly beats her lunch in the middle of combat
---
Dynamikes will nut
---
Your math is right. two negatives (the word "lose" and minus sign) makes a positive
---
How’s that stupid? Chest or event ticket best option? And what do you get from chest? More gold . I think this is stupid. 
---
I know they don’t sale gems for gold but apart from giving skins for gold which they won’t, nothing else is worth exchange. 
---
Giving 5 gems for 500 or 1000 coins is not a bad deal. Anyway they’re giving gems in the brawl box already. 
---
OP: Makes post to show how bad matchmaking is...
---
Shows a "pity" match where he faced off against bots. 
---
I realize that but if put maps then that would take too long and TBH I’m really lazy so yeah
---
I really like the color-scheme of this one. ^^
---
oof 
---
I dont understand the deal with motherfuckers who chase ALL the way around the map, almost every time they kill you, get to half hp or less, then someone else just jumps on them and those dumbasses die as well??
---
the three shellys won
---
This is my horrible matchmaking experience lol. The piper on our team was throwing the game
---
https://i.imgur.com/AxSL3vc.png
---
Thag you brawl fanatic, very cool
---
What?
---
I've had teammates who ran into bombs when they had time to run away 
---
Good job. Sometimes you have to act like your enemies.
---
True.
---
I think that to be a real assassin, his super should be fully charged after hitting 8/9 daggers or 5/6 daggers + 4 poison ticks so we can use the super to jump on a weak enemy, kill him and jump to another or escape not immediately but as soon as possible, so an enemy would  have a chance to kill him before he flies away again.
---
Also the daggers launched by the super are not very useful imho, they could be removed and maybe replaced by a basic attack of 3 daggers to the nearest enemy on landing so that crow would get obviously killed in a 1v2 or 1v3 but has high chance of winning instead on a 1v1 even against a tank at half hp (like an assassin should have).
---
The star power, basic attacks damage and reload time could be the same as it is now for me.
---
It's likely an processor problem but brawl stars been ignoring me so :/

Please reply to the comment above with I guess.

Why did u post a random image of bull?

Bull is cool

I know you had nothing to do, and you say #STOPTHESPIN, yet you still spin..
---
&gt;	The English wasn’t really the problem here but rather the sentence structure. English isn’t my native language either.
---
the man forgot a comma. 
---
while you're at it, make a 120 players battle royale showdown just like PUBG XD
---
6 darryls
---
And you got problem with that?
---
There is an strategy hahaha
---
 more like **Barycochetyll**
---
what did they mean?
---
So..?
---
This felt like an action movie wth.
---
I spun to keep myself alive and to destroy the teamers, throwers spin in order to stay alive and gain trophies. My aim was to kill throwers and I don’t give 5 shits about losing trophies fam.
---
He's begging real hard. 
---

Nothing

It'd be fun! They just have to make this changes:
---
(1)Solo-Now 12 people 
---
(2)Duo-Now 6 teams
---
(3)Trio-4 Teams
---
(4)Squad-3 Teams
---
In addition make maps 2 tiles larger and a higher chance of Power Box appearing...
---
You can buy better things for 49 gems
---
So do you have a YouTube channel where you upload videos?
---
If you're playing on Wi-Fi, this is the problem. For some reason Wi-Fi connections no matter how fast constantly drop.
---
You'll have better luck playing on data.
---
Well, Rico has the bullets left at the end of his range. But Darryl will break the wall (I found a map where he can endlessly ricochet and experiment)
---
The first one that looks good
---
Looool bro you gotta watch youtube a little bit more his skill is in his bounce shots not his super so ur a noob you cant bounce his shots and thats what makes him good and his star power good GIT GUD idiot
---
This is why I quit. Brawlstars is my favorite mobile game ever and I can't play because every time I do I get paired with people way higher level than me and I lose trophy's constantly. Fix this shit, Supercell. I just want to enjoy the best mobile game
---
No time to explain
---
Either Trio Showdown or a 5v5 gamemode
---
It's all fun and game until a 16 cubes El Primo walks into you.

Yeah lol

Yeah that’s what I was doing

Come on guys this is a game. No politics pls

Ohh sorry ...

I just got Leon after opening hundreds of boxes I have no other legendary or mythics
---
I’ll take that as a compliment 
---
Time to was the teamers with soap
---
But throwers could easily kill him so...
---
I wouldn't do it
---
My little bro was saying this just a couple weeks ago lol

Damn... That's some bad luck you got there

well the real problem is 4 people teaming... or 5... or 9 😂

What ? What kind of 9 year old facebook shit is this ? 
---
alright my bad, your new cell mate is a Bull with a no bush map in Bounty
---
And decrease afking, I keep getting games where the show down is someone with no power ups in a bush who suicides for 2nd place.
---
This was beautiful. Poor Darryl, his sacrifice was not in vain
---
That’s actually really good! I’m looking forward to seeing more skins by you! 😉
---
If I was one of those throwers I'd have turned on my team when they all grouped up 😂 perfect chance to be ruthless.
---
Really? 
---
Dynamike and Barley skin
---
This is my favorite of all your artworks
---
Its cringey to me not by Nytes attitude but by how noobish he is. And I agree with someone that mentioned how Molts attitude is cringey as well. I used to watch every video of Molt, but it got to a point that in every single video he would rage a couple times for different reasons so I stopped watching him. I Love watching chief pat as well as kairos and lex

FBI OPEN UP

Ppl can still team without spinning , other ways like attack opposite direction etc. 
---
you get Mike at the trophy road...

Any skin ideas for pieper and Frank? Love your concepts

There's already a glitch where you can do that

What is your legendary luck number when u get him?

Thank you! I still have many more!💪

Y would u team anws if ur brawlers are so low trophies 
---
Ty
---
Trump Leon
---
Disgusting throwers
---
Ok...
---
This is def a yes
---
Sometimes getting corner is an unlucky draw, other times, it's your bad positioning/decision making
---
Leon &gt; Carl
---
U need a better positioning , awareness of other brawlers around u . 
---
Why? 
---
For sure. I really want spike
---
How can I get one?
---
Thanks for the info! I appreciate that!
---
Booooo

I love his concept. He looks like pororo with cart. How cute :))

---
Getting Spike
---
I'd avoid the 8 power cubes guy or try to kill him fairly.
---
Lol the only reason why i was teaming is because i am hella tilted with him from el primo and bulls teaming on me when i played legit same with my penny cept i dont team with penny anyways i lpst arounf 60 trophies too so i think I've been well served karma
---
Got my first legendary at lvl 55 a month ago with .0987%  chance
---
As a mortis I approve of this message
---
gee you’re right! wow OP should’ve made a joke about that!!!
---
10/10 legit would buy.
---
You should add some sort of star player to showdown. Even solos for the one who gets more kills(not for being the winner). And gets 1-2 extra trophies for doing so.
---
The thing about this is that everyone will be El Primo or a tank such as Bull
---
For or from?
---
More like when you get a gem at mid
---
He dropped the soap
---
Tru
---
This is a problem so old that should have been a priority by now since it’s not fixed already. But night witch mortis was more important I guess 
---
Both and the 80 gem one?
---
I don't mind to be honest
---
Thank you, especially since I am working hard lately!🔥
---
Unlocking any brawler affects your luck rate so yea
---
Seems very generalised, people with high powercubes tend to be very aggressive, you might try to kill him fairly and put trophies on the line, but most wouldn't 
---
I try not to team as well,teaming only when facing other teamers, but most of the players would rather protect their trophies, it's not right, but it's not indefensible
---
Abominachet 
---
But u wear teaming with the Darryl so u we're teaming to but it's ok you did a good job 😂
---
Not newbie friendly and I dont think its worth it anyway like cmon 50 gems? Not even a Mega Box
---
Law of averages my friend

Wonderbrad and being trash

Nothing, I just wanted to get a rise out of the uninformed masses lol. People hate trump because the news tells them to, I find it humorous

That's not how this works. That's not how any of this works.

I mean do they serve any purpose?

That Pam just basically killed his teammate lol
---
I miss the old rico

I suppose you are a maxed player, because when you hit 0.24% or 0.25% it's a guaranteed Legendary. 
---
.. just check the bushes 🤦‍♂️
---
Alright check brawlstars new or my profile
---
Power level isn’t put into matchmaking.. it’s based on total trophies (mainly higher up) and brawler’s individual trophies
---
*yes*
---
Its incredible!
---
It’s because 90% of people with 3000 trophies and a brawler with less than 50 trophies is bo
---
Damn. Good luck to you friend. I know you'll earn it all back and even reach a new goal!!

But the point of the poison is to prevent people from healing, not to do tons of damage

ToS of supercell says you have to be 13 or older to play this game. They do also mention that they have the right to monitor chats and "punish" when they feel is necessary. I do agree with you though, if you aren't doing anything derogatory towards a specific person/group of people/type of people, you shouldn't be punished, but that isn't my decision... :(
---
I just find out that ": thanks
---
How do u have -gems
---
But teaming isn’t a problem according to Supercell...
---
Carl didn't even come out and the madman still managed to come up with a skin
---
Can we just take a moment and appreciate the man's ridiculous dedication? 👏👏👏
---
Really¿¿??
---
hahaha that's funny.
---
Just upgrade your skill
---
Too op, he can say the n word
---
I played the system the system played me
---
I liked the vertical game more than the horizontal one. Tap to fire was actually fun and you needed skill. Also throwers were much more comfortable to use
---
The age limit to 12. Hysterical!
---
Just did it ! And for the last question, I don't think people will admit teaming ;)
---
holy carp cyn finally 
---
Bet supercell won’t do this 😉😎
---
Imagine a team of poco, Pam, and Gene, all with star powers, on healing mushrooms... literally never die

r/woooosh
---
Did it say banned for inappropriate language again? If so, they re-evaluate why you were banned and they may extend it. You may have been able to get a game in before they re-evaluated it.   
---
This is a guess based off how this has happened in a different game.
---
* Heavy breathing *
---
Actually showdown was a all vs all but with all this teaming and passive game where people just hide and go out when at least 5 people are dead, with this bonus you can lose less trophy if you are more active on the map or you gain more trophy because you killed people, making backstab on teaming more juicy
---
Would be cool if everyone had different ranges of vision (bo, Mortis, piper, and Brock may be able to see further than say Bull, Primo, and Shelly) It might not be balanced per say, but who cares if it’s unranked/ optional
---
what kinda question is this, obviously you do
---
Ahh ok
---
Just kiss me already ÙwÚ
---
r/mixedemotions 
---
Nice idea
---
You mean spinning? I don’t think they patched that yet...
---
He’s... not... white...
---
Many time I killed 2 people and get killed, at the end I just lost trophy and time because I was fighting like the game mode asking
---
You’re probably right, but it is anonymous and there’s no penalty for teaming right now so there’s no reason for anyone to lie.
---
that bull’s retarded lmao
---
Or they could bring back life leech which prevented teaming altogether
---
I mean tbf if you get star player from a loss there's quite a big skill variance in your team, i.e. that the rest of your team aren't very good.
---
It's Nacho Business... 😂 
---
1 each kill will be good, if you play good you can get 9 extra trophy
---
Lol they didn't change his name, just changed the font to transparent on the "cochet"
---
I say, 1 respawn per Player. Or, respawning platforms appear around the map, and your teammates must hold the point for a certain amount of time for you to respawn. It will make it so people don’t respawn chain or anything dumb 
---
Hey he thinks your good at the game but you should never accept them especially above 6k

It’s not Monday

I like the map if you like my map too pls

Who is Carl
---
With my first level 9 brawler I got their star power in a few boxes. Now I leveled up Poco to 9 and have opened a few dozen, and still no star power. Ever since I got him to 9, his star power is sitting in the shop for 2k gold, which I don't have. I wonder if the star power drop chance is way lower while it is in the shop.

Okay. You, and the other millions of players have spike, leon, and/or crow. Thats great. We dont care. Stop spamming the sub with this crap... instead maybe try actually having a discussion on an interesting topic.

that gene wasn’t bad compared to most genes i’ve played with

TGAY
---
But colors are a disadvantage, remove the colors, even from the default skin
---
Cool but the Instagram peeps can can crop out credit

Only great power can hold evil in check. If it takes teaming to kill the greater teamers, so be it.

I love dis skin btw, just why do we needs to combine games ;-;

Will you introduce new trophies rewards and new boxes? Copy to Angry Birds 2, because the are doing so good work with their comunity and they make them happy with their game rewards and events sistem. Will you include differents events(no tickets).

Its actually is cuz it makes you have an advantage but can also make you lose cuz of petraying

Honestly though, they must have been pissed enough to leave a bad review and OP was just looking for bad reviews so I don’t see what the big fuss is

It was just released on global. Give them a break. Other than that you make some good points. I didn’t know teaming had been around for that long. They should have done something in 1.5 years.

What do you guys think of it? Which brawlers will be strong/weak?

Will this kind of map change the mechanics of Gem Grab?

What do you guys think about the map in overall?

Maybe it's a Garfield/Heathcliff type of thing where creators come up with similar concepts independent of one another.

Now you’ll get a losing streak.

Wow, I actually very like this kind of map! Always fun, trying new things!😇
