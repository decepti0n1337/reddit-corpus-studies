Hahaha, I’ll take that as a compliment. I guess some of us like to look on the sunny side of things!  😉  Thanks for the comment dude!
---
---
---
Sorry I'll dumb it down a little. 
---

---
50 Token yes
---
80 ticket yes.
---
Fuck everything else
---
Sorry, what does 'stats' mean?
---
600 but without bandaid
---
But also try to look were things can improve. Lol
---
Why is this so accurate.
---
Im losing to the boss pls nerf
---
Oof it happened
---
Also keep in mind that even without band-aid, she is far from the worst brawler in the game, and that's mainly because of her super. It does over 2x as much damage as her normal attack, not to mention it also stuns and slows down with her star power, making her counter people like Frank and Bibi very easily. Also the fact she can chain her super makes her literally unbeatable if you get to her at point blank range
---
Wishing you the best of luck mate!
---
Only I bet that in the only box that will give u gems there will be 8 gems?
---
Yes. Yes i did.
---
Haha appreciate that!
---
Yeah, hope my randoms see this tip, great idea and artwork!
---
El primo in a nutshell?
---
Ok so AFMD
---
That works too yeah 😂 Also sorry to be asking so many questions but what’s the most efficient event to spend my tickets on? Robot Rumble? The 5-1 Big Brawler thing? You don’t have to make detailed answer like the other one, don’t worry!
---
12.5k no legendaries or gene
---
And there's no such thing as crystals in this game
---
I hate seeing this cause my highest is primo 809
---
Im sorry for the people that are want stuff with this bibi... ruining fan arts this deserves A+ on art and an F for respect
---
Why you post this here?! Also: *cries in f2p* :(
---
Tick can't hear anything she said
---
Actually got a good laugh out of me
---
I have shelly at power 9 I really want bandaid. But 600 trophies isn’t that bad right?
---
I think he means meth, that would make more sense
---
Of cold i bet
---
9.5/10*
---
If you know how to play Dynamike he becomes one of the best brawlers in the game. With his current damage he can 2 shot squishies like Barley and Piper, and 3 shot others like Carl, Bibi, Leon, Jessie, Nita, and more. While he isn't skilless, anybody who remotley knows how to play him can be extremely dangerous. Also no one would pick Barley over him because he still has more health and their supers work completely differently.

---
Exactly, it’s actually great that Supercell never listens to all the players supporting this hahaha
---
Why do people always calculate that wrong ? The doublers give you 80 boxes on top of the 80 you normaly get. That said it' 40 days of progress compared to a brawler that has a 0.xxxxx chance.
---
As a fellow blender user, nice background at least!
---
500 is the best
---
“My friends gems glitched” I’m explaining that refunding gems is the only way for this to happen.
---
EXACTLY !!!!!!!! It has happened to me 6 000 times with mega box - 45 gems (I had 40 gems😭)
---
then theres me with a lvl 8 shelly at 500

Message me a screenshot of ur account I’m too tired to keep going

Literally didnt understand a thing u said but ok
---
I have an idea aswell.
---
"Cornered Cactus" : when spikes health reaches "x" percent, spikes will shoot out in an area around him dealing 500 per hit.
---
The effective area could be 3 tiles or whatever, I'll let others decide what's balanced. And the health percent could be 40%.
---
Also how can I post star power ideas?
---
Plz color it it’s actually really good!
---
the donation would be made by the player's name and tag
---
Idk why buy he gives mr some KND vibes! Also nice art
---
My son had 60 something at one point
---
Is that ticket offer any good?
---
19k and rising ~
---
!
---
You should post this on r/brawlstarsnextlevel,  we love fan art
---
Mortis gets shit on by auto aim 21k trophies if you wanted to know.
---
Hhhmm I like the idea, but I'd make the health precent lower and have like 8 spikes pop out with 350 damage each
---
Pretty low considering the trophy update but l.
---
That is priceless,  i thought it was solo showdown at first
---
Yes fix teaming but don’t ask for upvotes dude
---
Ok, thnx for the feedback. Yours would be balanced imo.
---
Thx bro!
---
That’s actually how I got barley but I hope this glitch gives me Shelly I heard her star power is pretty good thanks you
---
21k..... lemme check the leaderboards
---
I think you can just Google the template, edit it and then upload the image
---
Well here's hoping
---
Ok, thnx
---
r/brawlstarsnextlevel... post it there,  we love fan art
---
Same but I have 530
---
Clearly carried by a duo partner or team. Not possible in current meta to take a level 1 Shelly that high on your own. Especially since your competition at 600+ is a better you (bandaid).
---
If I have the power to gift you gems I would
---
Me too !!
---
It's like the game knows you have that specific amount of gems, just to piss you off
---
Careful with concepts on this sub,  it can get you a 3 day ban...
---
Try r/brawlstarsnextlevel,  we're into that. 
---
Love the idea
---
I like it but it is soo good that ot would cost 150 gems
---
K go ahead, let me know if you see a “ManckTheDank” even in the game considering its not my ign lol
---
Where’s copypasta guy
---
Then what is
---
lol, the date is my birthday
---
[removed]
---
Hoping is better than nothing. 🙂
---
Believe me, i suck in add color
---
Kuff if you’d like to know, check me out! ;)
---
Are you in a club?
---
Yeah when I was at 8k I matched up with a 22k player. 
---
Lol, I thought we were evenly skilled but the trophies wouldnt suggest that. It surprised me but I have a good friend now because of it lol.
---
He may not seen it
---
this is more depressing than having a tilted brawler
---
Report him from life
---
**I AM NOT A SELLOUT**
---
yeah it should...
---
I pushed mortis there.....WITH NO STAR POWER AND AT LEVEL 6
---
Yeah, I think they only added it back because some kids whonnever played on the map said "petition to add cavern churn back"
---
And some people were calling it a good map.
---
Passage is better than this.
---
r/fbiopenup

Eu já tenho, mas conheço a realidade de como é difícil...
---
El primo with 10 gems FUNNY!!!! 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😳
---
Loop*
---
lmao keep up the good work dude
---
Br
---
and i am at 450 trophies with lvl 10
---
Leon is dead
---
Why is this sideways 🙄
---
Basically any tank.
---
well yeah. it's way too difficult to get legendaries.  opening brawl boxes might not get you one since chances are so low. here for price of 5 mega boxes you get lvl 5 leon.
---
Oh
---
then theres me with power 2 gene at 505
---
Total shock fills your body
---
Oh no it’s you again
---
our truth would be much better
---
Bruh tf lol
---
LOL SAVAGE 😎😎😂😂😂😂
---
Aw don’t say that.
---
Rebel? So, where is lambda on shoulder? :P
---
You get a 9/10
---
Like I said though, Colt can dish out more damage quicker than Leon both point blank and far away and has a faster reload plus with Leon's spread you're almost never getting all 4 blades to hit they are fairly slow projectiles compared to others so I just don't get how it would be broken if there's already another brawler that still has better stats if Leon didn't have drop off damage
---
12000
---
*600+
---
You lose 8 trophies when you get last place in duo showdown
---
This is the worst stock photo I’ve ever seen. Why isn’t the person going for the cue ball?

Spitting facts

Penny

I love her splash damage and her cannon^^
---
Wow that was so fast
---
Wow!!
---
mortis looks like he has coiled snake for every attack in the old days
---
Most of my brawlers are empty maybe 16/25 are just one skin
---
They are so wealthy !
---
When you get so good at the game, you only need numbers and the extra graphics are super annoying
---
F
---
WHERE DO YOU GET THESE MODELS
---
GIVE US THESE MODELS SO THAT WE CAN MAKE BRAWL STARS GMOD SHID
---
Wow haha what a perfectly normal copypasta
---
My prayers are with you
---
That’s the exact thing I asked him, all he said was that I had to search around.
---
I want to strangle you sooo bad right now :(
---
yeah at that point just screw the power points if you could
---
There is only quick search for supercell
---
No he will get charmed and.... 
---
to be continued---&gt;
---
Why :)
---
ok , nobody cares dude ;)
---
Cause my side  account is 2700 trophies and only rico and rares
---
So true I had 38 gems and I needed 39 for 1400 token doublers and I didn’t  get a single gem for 2 days and then the next box I open after the offer is up I get 3 gems 😢
---
Outstanding move.
---
My side account has Tara an I was around 900 too
---
This is a sign from God
---
Not funny. Didn’t laugh
---
😡 this game hates me then
---
Also I unlocked spike for my friend we was in the bus an I opened his free box in the shop
---
and  pp
---
Might as well get some gems and then you can go buy skins or star powers with the extra
---
"I'm shaking"
---
Yes officer, this one right here.
---
hey, “yOu BrOKe My GUitaR!!!” hahaha just kidding, i think poco IS loco and his range is nutty, plus he’s really good with 90 percent of the brawlers in the game
---
680 Trophies!!!????? *TRIGGERED NOISES*
---
and me
---
Am vazut videoul:)
---
*Kaizuku nii! OWERANARU!*
---
Awww...at least we have CanYaDigIt
---
Jealous?
---
he look like el primo's long lost retarded brother
---
Incoming Copypasta... arts nice though, color it maybe?!
---
Imagine molecular brain people not getting star player and naming themselves star player.
---
I killed gene, so he is mad
---
I'm at 6.35k, no legys and Mortis is my only mythic
---
It looks slightly disturbing that Primo's hands almost touch the ground
---
YES.I'm god
---
Damn she skeeted hard from that small moment
---
Oh so that's why Primo's hands were so long lol
---
No it's Brawl Stars
---
Lamo nah you're getting drafted
---
Nice
---
You buy Leon though?
---
Lmao u ppl r lucky im close to 10k and dont have any legendaries. Im also pretty sure most of us dont even have all mythics and some super rares! Im still happy with what i got and i dont like ppl who get legendaries before 8000 ;( its just unfair
---
Yes
---
Mortis 
---
Coz I’m too good with THE CREATURE OF THE NIGHT
---
I also bought the mythics I have
---
Faxx I’ve had so many encounters where they’ve survived with 20 or so health and I know without the nerf it would’ve killed them and it honestly hurts.
---
Lol rip everyone who are F2P and also have that offer in the shop
---
same for my nita
---
Technically the max powerpoints someone can have is 1410, unless you want those extra powerpoints to be converted to gold
---
nice.
---
Here are some tips for mortis!
---
I'm primarily a gem grab player with mortis cos shotgunners are not as common in gem grab, and mortis does terrible against them.
---
So just to preface all this: my tips are for him in gem grab.
---
I'm sure you're already doing some of these things, but lemme just reiterate a few basic tips for him :)
---
So the first thing about mortis is that you should know your burst potential. By that, I mean how much damage you can do with 2 swipes + a super and 3 swipes + a super.
---
Your goal should be to pressure the opponents with your presence by lurking around (and not getting hit! So you make them waste their ammo on you) while waiting for a chance to kill off a weakened enemy or squishy brawler.
---
This is where your burst potential comes in, because you need to know if you can kill the brawler in your interaction. If you can't, then it's likely that you'll end up dying with the enemy brawler, which might be a trade that isn't worth it for your team.
---
The second thing is that he should always be played as an aggro brawler. He goes to the enemy's territory, walks around and just intimidates them with his presence because they now have to worry "what if my health becomes low and mortis swoops in and finishes me off".
---
Never underestimate the importance of a good aggro! It's what you feel in showdown when you see an 11 power bull approaching you --&gt; he may not be able to hit you yet, but you keep your distance from him and you change your movement patterns because of his presence.
---
So just because you have trouble killing everyone as a level 6 mortis doesn't mean you're not helping your team. If you're staying alive and pushing the enemy back from the spawn, you're basically already doing a lot of your job there by letting your teammates gain control of the map (and gems).
---
For this reason, it's also very important to try to avoid picking up gems with mortis cos while playing aggro it's highly likely you will die. But remember! Your death is still worth it if 2 enemy brawlers waste 6 shots killing you, cos that's 6 shots not attacking your teammates playing mid/support.
---
Autoaim: i'm sure you've heard a lot of youtubers tell you to never autoaim. Personally, I think it has it's uses. It's a lot faster than swiping when used correctly, and it's sometimes very important to kill the enemy (e.g. brock) before he gets his last rocket off (which kills you).
---
So autoaim when close BUT DO NOT AUTOAIM IF:
---
1. There are walls nearby
---
2. There are enemy brawlers near -&gt; autoaim might target the wrong one
---
3. If you are fighting an enemy mortis (e.g you dash -- guess what he dashes away/through).
---
4. If you are a fighting an enemy jessie/penny and you've counted that they are close to their super
---
Lastly, try to count for your opponent's ammo. Dr. Mmm on youtube has a good guide where he uses a a nita in brawl ball, I believe, but the idea for mortis is you need to keep track of your opponent's ammo count so you know whether they have enough ammo to burst you down or whether you can kill them first.
---
Target the following brawlers:
---
Crow, spike (super + 3 dash range -- make him waste a shot as his reload is slow), piper, rico, penny (low burst damage to you), tara (without full ammo, if you get the swipe in you can kill her easy), brock (stay out of his autoaim distance of ~3 tiles, count that he has 2 ammos before going in), frank.
---
And ofc dynamike and barley and tick!
---
For this reason, gem grab is quite a decent mode cos his main weaknesses (bull, shelly) aren't as common!
---
hahahahah! “mORtiS, BRInGer Of DoOm!”
---
Lost to a guy with zero trophies the other day.
---
wtf is that shit
---
i like it
---
Don't worry sir, some Carls will detect seismic activities for u :)
---
R A N D O M S

Buy all of it for an absolute power move.
---
This deserves atleast 2k upvotes
---
I bought leon for 30 bucks
---
Shaking is illegal here
---
Go to another place if you want to shake
---
Thanks a lot! get as much carl as u can or maybe the whole r/CarlGang
---
Actually, that time I do a funny thing in friendly game (because I don't have Tara's star power). First, I use Tara's super to make a hole at the corner. Then, I use Tara's super again to put the shadow into the hole. Then, the bots break the walls and I saw the shadow stuck at the corner.

Thank you

Is Tara ok in solo?
---
An stace in the face must hurt...
---
Wow, he played like a true dumbass. Holy shit, wow I'm triggered. Glad I wasn't his teammate.
---
How is dat even possible? You are in the global leader board!
---
Don’t spend gem on anything other than characters and you’ll have all of the legendaries in a month
---
Smart boi
---
r/youtubeforkids ???
---
This is stupid
---
That’s so cute and sad
---
That's a good idea
---
Ummm Shelly obviously is the brawler that requires the most skill..so YES?
---
His pink gradient manicure's fire
---
For people like:"No, Crow needs a buff!!" He is literally strongest legendary right now. He got:fast reload speed, highest dps out of the legendarys (Leon was so close and Spike was hitting only 3 spikes) He got long range and easy to land attack, his super allows him to deal even with Mortis and even Franks, and he can push enemies back and almost always people are teaming with him. Even if ur a anti-teamer, he is still really good just because of his fast movement speed which allows him to easily dodge shots and get close to squishy brawlers. His star power might seem weak, but it allows him to survive 1 extra ammo from:Penny, Jessie and Poco. So i think he needs a nerf.
---
Sir, you just had two powerful jokes about Shelly go over your head and you took it seriously...
---
Oof
---
No ots hard cus every randoms have noob players as a teamate

Nice. Now, back to fixing my -326 Gems after purchasing Leon.
---
Not this new Leon offer, but the old 350 one. I actually bought it.

Yes an no i really like the play style of mortis an leon is idk ruthless but i like being an support character like Jessie an sometimes being a tank

---
Yes it is
---
Post this image every time someone complains about fair matchmaking.
---
Oops
---
Yes the only map I was able to make consistent progress on him and push him to 500 as a Rico6. Was awesome - now I can sit on him and not play him till he is maxed, which won’t happen for a long time.
---
Oh no i meant 160 overall. 80+80.
---
Lol how can ppl be so dumb doesn't he know its a duo sd

What?

Im almost 10.000
---
Then theres me with a power 6 Shelly at 200
---
Nice one. Mortis used to be really good in bb. Then he got nerfed. So people tend to think he isnt good anymore. Hes actually still really good, just not as overpowered as last time
---
How many trophies you got?
---
Bull wth Tenacilous B is a counter to Band-aid Shelly. Idk why they scrapped the idea.
---
I havale Crow and Im 9500
---
Oh, I got Leon at 4k with 20 boxes

Nah man I don't gem, I'm a F2P since android launch

Here's a fact: nobody cares if Leon is on sale in the shop

Penny the best brawler
---
I upvotes solely because of the title
---
Crow.
---
I'm 10k with only 1 mythic and mo leg
---
"you also could have bern doing bad"... no, i picked jess with starpower who is really strong in robo rumble. there is no excuse for picking brawlers other than jess, pam, primo, rosa or frank in this mode. these players didnt only perform badly, they were completely ignorant for other players trying to farm tokens
---
Aha
---
To make something annoying even worse. it's great!
---
Just because you picked a good brawler doesn’t mean you’re the best player to have ever existed

I mean it's kinda official, it says in the Pixel Crux main menu, that it is the Official Companion App for Supercell Games
---
What's unsettling, the fact pam can blow primos dick up in a twitch of a finger or the fact you got #1 winning 0 trophies also HOW THE FUCK?
---
I like this map
---
I like this
---
Any intentions on others?
---
Yeah same shit...i'm 13k and my legendary chance is very low...
---
I see I'm not the only one who thought this
---
0.0144 with 2 legendaries, i want crow
---
Ikr supercell what the frick... how is that Gx 770 trophies with Nuta
---
U forgot the 10 gems
---
It’s like duo vs solo, separate waiting rooms.
---
Nice...I need only 2...spike and leon
---
I can do anything
---
Just throw in a 45 minute half, see the final score, rebuild the obstacles every 5 minutes.
---
Not funny didn't laugh
---
ummm ... ok? you didnt understand anything i just typed did you?
---
`I S  T H I S  A  S E R I O U S  Q U E S T I O N ? !`

10k but sameeeee
---
The Brawliverse!!!
---
Hehe👌🤙
---
Good skin but guerrila brock would be abetter name and he should have like camouflage on his face and scars
---
Look his dous win
---
Easter Egg
---
atleast you got 5 trophies
---
Hitboxes
---
Frank is a badass
---
He didnt
---
Güzel olmuş gardaş
---
Press f to pay respects

'-'
---
Hate when my Duo teammate tries to team with other teams
---
Open some boxs
---
he tried the youtube way there is clips of gene pulling enemys to kill,but he failed
---
Sad frank noises

Is this actually real?

Me : See this Post

\+fail
---
*El primo looks like he's really on CRACK*
---
He probably has no clue what you meant. I’d put a lot of money that him and Brock were together. Either way, it’s absolute crap. I’m over 20k...3 gems grabs in a row to get my star token, I didn’t have a single teammate over 5k total. It’s a absurd.
---
*TRIGGERED*
---
Gotta flex
---
This is very good
---
Water: *exists in bb*
---
Poco: THATS MY NEW HOME
---
i feel so bad to the enemy piper..
---
Unless OP proves that he went in with that Barley &amp; Piper joined randomly due to matchmaking, he should stop acting like a whiny loser.
---
Ikr just wanted to post something
---
Clean up crew!
---
Lmfao supercell failed the matchmaking of bs so badly
---
There is no skill involved so picking an optimal brawler who has a high power level is the only thing you can do and he did exactly that.
---
Get it
---
he would still have 0 gems, this isn't instagram or facebook
---
Leon never to be found again
---
Yeah legit its the worst matchmaking I've ever seen
---
Buy Bandita Shelly, only cost 30 gems
---
80% of all randoms I play RoboRumble with pick Shelly. Who told them Shelly was good in RoboRumble. Shelly can chain supers against BRAWLERS but no against bots. She is basically a Bull with less damage,less health and a useless starpower
---
Finally.
---
#A SKIN WORTH INVESTING IN
---
Leon Gang Anyone?
---
Nothing he just wanted to say hi
---
And then the loading screen changes 😂
---
CR deserves to be stranded for its toxicity. I don’t think anyone can resist taunting endlessly like they’re 10 unless it’s a twitch streamer. I miss the good old days of “Good luck” and “Good game”
---
Big oof
---
and then 10 minutes later they will be shooting each other again
---
Hmm, thats a cool idea! My opinion is that there is too much grass on the map, but it still looks cool. The gamemode is interesting👍
---
Hey Pat, who’s your favourite and least favourite brawler in the game?
---
Yeah you could say that
---
No that's not true. I saw pros with maxed brawlers not getting 6:15 several times and I'm not even maxed. I use level 7 and 8 brawlers.
---
Tbx
---
Nice luck you got there m8
---
Like: Coiled Snake
---
Dislike: anything besides Coiled Snake
---
Rico one is too overpowered
---
Then there not “pro” what’s your definition of pro?
---
I like more daily deals offer :))
---
Are you sad
---
Hmm, looks cool, I would like to have one like that👌
---
Do you miss all your rockets as Brock?
---
What A Coincidence 😆. Or Is It For Real? 🤔
---
0oOf
---
i would like it if people would make original content like 1337 trophies but nooo gotta be unoriginal
---
meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
---
Found this in hot. Enjoyed it. Sometimes it speaks for its self. But this is also a place where I tell people reposts are dumb and get 28 downvotes, so don’t mind me. I’m a man of un-respectable opinions.
---
Do you know something about if supercell are giving a use to bands ?
---
Spotify cheese
---
Ils my favorite brawler
---
G-
---
team mers
---
You mean *deathpacito*
---
Thank you, man!
---
Is this a real thing?
---
Thx
---
Wooow, nice drawing👌 How long did it take?
---
I actually didn’t watch much YouTube before I started my channel - as one of the first mobile gaming creators in 2012, I sorta just liked playing Clash of Clans and had a weird urge to make content. 
---
The early days were amazing, I remember gaining my first 10 subscribers and calling my mom and asking why she made so many accounts. 
---
YouTube today is still great, but back then it was a bit more innocent, you know? Things are just much more professional nowadays with higher production value, and everyone is much more business savvy. It was a Wild West back then.
---
Will you record more videos with Chief Cat in the future?
---
I think chief pat don't speak german so i tell.
---
A german YouTuber called Kyle made a video with the title "I took the *NEW* Carl TO showdown &amp; this happened".
---
Brawl Bro is to lazy to make own Thumbnails and video ideas thats why he has 5 videos with a translated Thbnail from Ash.
---
Puuki is too bad to do any thing so he just opens every video 50 mega boxes.
---
I like this one a lot!
---
True true
---
Which brawler is best against thrower's  ?
---
XDD
---
Chief, What is your favourite Star Power? Do you know something about the Huge Announcement?
---
I hope you answer!
---
Not really. The point is that Brawl Stars players are 99% P2P. The truth is they buy it
---
Side side to side
---
Thanks a million
---
ouch
---
What is it with all these third star powers
---
Yeah sure 😂
---
Lol wouldn’t fit
---
If you (by obligation) had to choose one brawler to scrap out of the game forever,which one you would choose and why?
---
I hope it forever be like that
---
I think a bee idea would work better for spike, like maybe he throws a hive and bees fly out, I just dont see how his attack would make sense for ticks attacks, looks good though
---
r/emojipolice I'm sorry sir, I'm gonna stop you right there.
---
El Primo's fault
---
Yessssss
---
I'm talking about those youtubers who have been playing for a long time and got everything maxed.
---
Awwww
---
EXACTLY!
---
Whoosh 
---
It’s /s guys
---
I don’t think it’s a repost
---
Yes we know it’s already been leaked for a month or so.
---
I’m default Rico, not special and feeling like decapitating myself when I lose
---
So we back in the mine
---
That’s a copypasta
---
Uninstall or dont complain
---
Lol someone in my club is lvl 25, 1.6k and has 18 brawlers. And then he's fuckin using a summoning phrase like, “/unlock#legendary@SPIKE_BoxOpening@1or3/SP”. It’s ridiculous, he has a 400 shelly main and barely plays any of the new brawlers he got.
---
He was named BO not 80 but pls dont call me stupid if im wrong
---
James Charles
---
Besides the slow effect (maybe stun?) it’s just a worse version of his first star power.
---
\*Sad Gyro noises\*
---
&lt;3 Byutifule
---
if they were in a spree, then why would i get a 0 teammate
---
I'm not complaining damn it
---
Mecha Crow
---
I think its just a joke. But the more its used the stupider it gets.
---
r/shittybrawlstars
---
Fucking nobody
---
does stacking actually increase the chances to get a new brawler? how does it work?
---
How many brawlers?
---
I agree, it just needs a buff that also gives a few seconds of immunity.
---
Delete this porn and also meme is not funny
---
Leonnnn
---
It’s not porn
---
**No emojis on Reddit.**
---
Somebody ready sumbitted this idea.. I think it's u/ChronoPierce
---
Guys, I'm fucking detecting seismic activity
---
Not enough boxes at spawn or even at the middle.  Other than that I'd say it's a solid sd map.
---
Not a bad idea!

That is called serious lag

What is your favourite brock skin
---
Halloween is my Bday and Darryl is my bff, so I would really enjoy this!

Yup so do I

You should consider yourself lucky from getting that in 10-15 boxes lol

guys pls no links that lead to nsfw posts at all, please.

You can select Icon????!!!!????!!!! Been playing since U.S. release.

leon was the first brawler released after global and all of the other rarities have gotten a new brawler so its going to be a legendary

Me: fighting off 3 brawlers

Angry robo: Showtime!

Will we be seeing anymore clash of clans?

*passpartout flashbacks*

Can you give us a future insight on big brawlstars esports coming?
---
mortis tara spike
---
Why aren't you missing rockets with brock?
---
Skin suits him well, since sometimes he can be really fucking annoying
---
Another brawler, mythic or legendary is just gonna be another pain of luck to figure out lol.
---
Instead of KDBSKDHWLDUE it's BZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ
---
Shelly*
---
What? I just said what you said. He's a man and he uses makeup and it's okay
---
Bad skin
---
What is the regulate chance to get a legendary brawler???Im at 13.6k now and i need just spike.
---
What’s up with the    &amp;#x200B;   under the graph?
---
Rule 34: Everything that exists has a porn version of it
---
Guess BS is another victim of R34
---
I use them in the opposite way. Shocky is defence with solid placement so the enemy team has to take lots of damage to destroy it. Energize is offence by just throwing it right in the middle of a team fight and constantly healing it.
---
I would totally do it
---
no im just saying how the bot just happens to always spawn closest to me and chase me
---
Wont work cause copyrights...
---
Nah, do all rosa
---
I like this a lot. He can shoot exploding stings
---
Nice art however Shelly isn't a trophy road but rather a starting brawler
---
He probably didn't know you were trying to get him to pass the ball
---
Well Ryuk is not gonna like this bit I’ll give you some time
---
Add penalties in the form of Account being temporarily banned (1 day) for scoring in your own goal twice in one game
---
Thank you)
---
Since you play mobile game often, do you have carpal tunnel?
---
Also do you still play Clash Royale even though you don’t upload it anymore?
---
best time is 13:14 using the exploit. my realistic best time was 6:17 or something like that. me being power 10 jess, my brother power 7 pam and a random pam lvl 10
---
Szerintem csak auto-hit volt
---
It's not once every 50 games. I get matchmaked with people on 4k-9k trophies EVERY game. Same thing happens on enemy side. It's not fun, you literally play 1 vs 1. Especially on bounty, best tactic is to leave enemy with same trophy range as you and kill others. Plus just had bounty match where i was in team with 10k and 7k against 7k, 3k and 6k. We won 42 to 1, they were killed immediately after losing their spawn shield. I liked this game, but after they've broken reward system it's no longer fun, i'll probably leave it soon. I'm 13k trophies player btw.
---
IKR
---
Thank you! Even so I have a feeling that my Piper is still a bit too different from the original Piper :')
---
Did u think mortis should get a reload buff since u can no longer dash-dribble in brawlball like beta and is no longer Op as hell in brawlball??
---
S T O N K S
---
Thanks! Autumn mood strikes in
---
[deleted]
---
Thank you!!
---
I’m at 16k trophies and I’m only level 105 so I won’t have the 120 badge for a while
---
Yeah I know but it was fun drawing it :D
---
Thanks :3
---
not cool. we all know this is from lwarb beta
---
I think coiled snake mortis is the best choice for bounty right now and it’s really hurting piper
---
Just happened to me a few hours ago
---
:joy::joy::joy::joy: when you play TEAM FORTRESS 2 :joy::joy::joy::joy: so you make BRAWL STARS MEME :joy::joy::joy::joy::joy:
---
As long as you are having fun, ill keep upvoting :D
---
Make u r autograph more visible since art thives are everywhere... Nice art though..
---
This is not your idea, you stole it from LWARB or Null's Brawl
---
It has begun
---
Awww thank you 😄
---
It's stolen
---
How about you just keep your distance out of his range like you do for darryl? Same thing.
---
Yeah. That boy looked like he had cancer
---
I remember leaving clash royale when it started deteriorating. Heard they added season passes and what not now, ruined my once-favourite game.
---
I’m trying
---
I have 14k no legendaries 😭
---
What is your two cents on the star points and the removal of the end of the season tokens?
---
Bruh stop posting 3rd Star Powers you stole them from LWARB or Null's Brawl
---
## bruh 😂💀💀💀💀
---
with randoms?
---
It's very hard to judge just how far he can dash due to his speed. With practice it can be done I guess
---
Oh how they shine
---
"BUFF MORTIS" 😂😂😂😂😂.
---
in brawl stars? no, it's actually LexGetsTheStix
---
Have my upvote sir
---
Thanks) Trying to somehow show my fashion sense(that I don't have) through Piper fanart
---
I find that once you get to the higher leagues people stop spamming emotes
---
Oh no
---
yo're acting like a play solo showdown, that gamemode is a pile of garbage because of you idiots
---
Bruh #2
---
actually, yeah i guess, it's kinda unfair that you're randoms were both low level when they were all max
---
I mean, i always say ggwpgl at the end and at the beginning gl and thank the opponent if they say it back too. Im only toxic if that person is toxic to me
---
HaHaHaHa LeOn Is InViSiBlE fUnNy
---
It just has a surprise factor. We’ll have to see if people get used to it eventually. If that happens, coiled snake won’t be as strong as it seems rn.
---
Fake ass shit he was in a room
---
Are You Bad At Playing Brock Because You Always Miss Your Rockets
---
i love democracy
---
U lost anyways
---
Still a dumbass
---
Ikr, Mortis Coiled Snake makes him extremely powerful in gem grab and bounty
---
Me too :') She is a fancy woman, but also kinda a cowgirl and I'm just scared of which direction they are gonna choose
---
Renaming this series to MONTHLY FANART now.
---
If Supercell keeps those brawlers coming I just bested you with one move! MWAHAHAH!
---
Also thank you very much!
---
He's Awesome even without any starpowers
---
You cant steal people thing
---
Thanks bro
---
they are all made by the same guy, maybe the post didnt appear in his feed so he kept posting it
---
Don’t worry about it I totally understand
---
Then delete the old ones
---
Are you kidding me? Toxic cards? That’s the stupidest shit I’ve heard in a while.
---
Ik can't wait😅😂
---
The season pass isn't what truly ruined the game. What ruined the game is the lack of f2p content. Every update had like 1 little thing for f2p players and then some massive addition that could only be experienced with micro-transactions or **SOMETIMES VERY RARELY** gems

It's cool but sadly they won't add it to the game because they will get copyrighted...Sad
---
REALLY REALLY EPIC
---
Its legendary for sure
---
Sorry to burst your bubble but as someone who animates, this is not too impressive, especially considering he said it took him five hours. There are a lot of people that could make this in less than ten minutes. I would give him more credit if he made the models, which is hard work, but he didn't, he found them. Looping a rig to walk, moving a character, doing a couple rotations and ending it is beginner stuff. If OP is a beginner, yes, nice. But if they have been doing this for a while and are trying to show off, it is not anything special.
---
I need to have that!
---
:&lt;
---
Which do you prefer? Brock or Piper?
---
Great! I play about 2 hours in total per day so it took me quite a while. How much do you play?
---
Never heard of team mer. Is that short for team merica?
---
Shelly isn’t considered a trophy road brawler actually :/. Still, great work!
---

Hope you cleared out your browsing history

Delete the others man

Oh yeah! That's a really good idea, thanks!
---
Damn u reply fast
---
Yeah I know but it was really fun to making it 😄
---
Whats is this shitty post?
---
No its not, no one is the same
---
Where
---
Probably on a flea market or some other place with knock offs, still a cool gift though
---
Um...ok? What's that and what's so bad with it?
---
That's great bud! Guess u played quite a good amount of time per day then😉
---
I have no idea...
---
FUC U
---
no
---
He's from the brawl stars discord server, you can go to my profile to see what he said before.
---
I was contemplating getting the gems I need for him earlier today, then opened him like third brawl box after that. Pretty lucky.
---
Ahhh... Kids. The very best people at ragging in a subreddit
---
17k! Damn bro! Congrats!
---
I got spike at 800 lmao now I'm almost at 7k and my legendary chance is. 0001%
---
No it instantly activates even if it charges while she is below 40%.
---
You really progressed great man!
---
Good, but the face is looking like a kid
---
Ill post how much I have at the end of the season😂 I'm trying to get 18k but I don't know if I'll be able to push 850 trophies in like one day😂
---
Seeing as how pros have to push 16~ hours a day for 2 weeks to compete for a top 10 spot in the world, what’s your stance on a league system that would prioritize win rates over time spent pushing?
---
Ah yes, my luck in every game that has unboxing
---
Shelly ain't from the trophy road
---
He plays duos and wanders into the poison.
---
Piper is very good in brawl ball
---
But 300 hp would trigger the band aid?
---
How is this "Humor"?
---
Supercell needs to ban him, also look at his name
---
To those if you who play bo in robo rumble I hope you drop your phone in the toilet.
---
Is he? I always thought invisibility would be a lame super
---
Kid, you posted this 7 times. Stop
---
I was about 30 seconds from booting him from our club when he left. I was sad. Wanted the pleasure of booting.
---
Another shitpost
---
whos better, spike or Leon?
---
The only issue is that it would make matchmaking longer at higher trophy levels.
---
Yes, but the picture literally says "No spin zone", and "Spin" is Gyro's main technique
---
No this is from actual brawl stars
---
But with his first star power it not only negates poison but also heals for more than you were originally damaged. It’s just better.
---
Please do
---
But why don’t I see a bush?
---
Cringe
---
Does a 5 year old know how to spell/read well you are an a-hole
---
I won’t ruin your happy moment then :) You won 8 virtual trophies from a video game :D

 I started laughing so hard when I noticed his name was "BrawlStarsIsGay" 😂😂
---
Bro you just posted cringe bro
---
He told you in the title smh
---
I'm just saying, you are acting like one trying to correct every little thing

That's an understatement... I'll bet he's white as a ghost now

I was saying this since the beginning. Adding emotes will just make it toxic, exceptions being "Good Luck" and "Good game" and some teamwork emotes like "Fall back" and such
---

What is your thoughts on the Star Points system implemented that replaced Token Season Rewards

Idk why everyone is hating on people who pay. They help keep the game running and without them, brawl stars wouldn’t still be around.

what's wrong with his name?

Ban him!!!!!

Because it's sad to lose that deal

It's like why these people even exist

Honestly, Clash Royale has lost its touch on me

Definitely would cop if they released this

This better be in the next update

GUYS IM SHAKING , IM FUCKING SHAKING I NEVER WANTED TO SLAP THE SHIT OUT OF THESE COPY PASTAS good art btw
---
Brock's super
---
But it's fun to think about the other's reactions. Wish there was global chat to imagine it better though
---
What is your opinion for the addition of campaign/more lore in Brawl Stars? Do you think it would be a good idea to add it?
---
Chances are he's in a 3 man squad with the other two all my brawlers are in the 300 rank except mortis hes 49 I assume it'd be the same for me if I was to play with a squad
---
First time seeing it work

Honestly, I don’t find club members much better and when I actually find someone who has great chemistry with me, they’re not online when I’m playing. My irl friends are all in their 8000s at best so...
---
The only Repost of a gedi-kor skin we can accept
---
First  star power is way better than this...
---
You mean quests? Or achievements?
---
Pam Frank and barley would go unto a little cavity and get 9 mins
---
Maybe you should see him from 6 tile
---
Nah, there's more People who can draw better than this...
---
C R O W P L E A S E D I E
---
Well definitely not worth it
---
Blank template please?
---
Them too but this is good
---
Well I didn't know...but okay?
---
Still too op man
---
&gt;I wish
---
That Pam: What the HELL are you doing?
---
You haven't Said "Brawl stars" with a robô Voice
---
It’s only 30 trophies...
---
Idk i thought it's great idea like the real life chameleon
---
..... that'll just extend the time and the match will be the exact same
---
oh boy it sure does
---
Kill hin
---
Maybe not every week but every day. I ramamber that the old clan chest in cr was stupid for being weekend only
---
That’s exactly the problem, it’s so easy to push brawlers now so players that have no experience can be up this high and just choke games. Showdown doesn’t make you good, it’s the 3v3 gamemodes lmao. I’m 10k trophies and I was playing when no one was on.
---
47
---
THICCNESS*
---
Ok good job
---
Showdown makes you good when you are playing mortis 700 and everyone is fighting for a place
---
Thank you for the answer! Good to know!
---
Barley had 320 HP now he has 3200. 320X10=3200
---
Maybe think first next time
---
Repost, this same thing was posted before
---
Its quite random first i got 1 in 150..then i got 3 starpowers in 30 box
---
No one gives a fuck if you are mortis or not, they want trophies
---
What were you guys doing this whole time though ?
---
Are u jerking off while recording???
---
Fair enough, I’m in the same predicament, started playing again after a long break and only have 12 k trophies.  But you always get that one random team which will help you push 200 trophies.
---
r/awfullykinky
---
Ah yes. Primo and shelly
---
I can’t wait for her Morris outfit
---
When it was 2 min and 30 seconds people hated it so when they reduced the time by 30 seconds it suddenly became good because you don't have to play that long for a star key
---
Shelley X Leon
---
because i solo carried that shit
---
https://www.reddit.com/user/Eryklav/comments/col923/another_random_shelly_pam_power_7_me_power_10/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share   those are my more regular games
---
But in your point you said you want to see it's effects it has but you can't buy it even if you like it. What if you tried a skin then wanted to buy it but couldn't because it isn't in the shop, that would be no fun.
---
Fall back would definitely be an abused emote.
---
Obviously band-aid
---
I simulated it I didn’t want to use any special effects lol that’s the best i could do for a robot voice
---
Ohhh yeah

BRUH😩😩👌🔥
---
What I can't hear you over the sound of, banjos.
---
Yes, that's no problem. Everyone makes mistakes, especially if you do something for the very first time. Now you know and you won't make that mistake again and as I saw, you deleted the emojis.
---
OMG SUPERCELL PLZ DON'T BAN HIM, GIVE HIM AN AWARD "BEST TROLLER OF BRAWL STARS"
---
Anyway still a masterpiece
---
r/subsifellfor.
---
What do you mean beat popularity is not better game.So you Say that
---
Minecraft just beat Fortnite popularity.So you mean Fortnite is better?
---
You dumb
---
Never play shelly please.
---
I’m gonna be honest right here as a Poco main right now 
---
If the dinner is getting cold EAT IT QUICK
---
Its the background.
---
Yes "chinese new year" is a wrong term technically
---
ROYAL AGENT COLT SKIN IS A KOREAN SKIN THO
---
Idk
---
Hi, thanks for offering but I honestly don't see a meaning to that since even their vice president participates in these
---
huh what do you mean fake?
---
it’s only a theory xd
---
I’ve been playing since global release
---
I'd pay 1k gems for this mode, especially when I play Gene
---
This is me when i play brawl stars 
---
Also, nice job 
---
I was cringing
---
Screeching solo still better!
---
LMMFFFAAAAOOO
---
I did the same thing, opened 40, got knowine
---
The xp at the end sounds like Gene's voicelines super fast
---
Ohhhh that makes more sense. Haha I guess I half wanted to blame the brawl stars gods for this loss
---
How do you still have level ones if you have been playing that long😂
---
Brawler vs skin
---
What’s brawl party?
---
Shell shock is a very good star power, high utility
---
Yeah cause you’re such an expert on top players lol.
---
Nice.
---
Star points just get you skins. A COSMETIC! It's bad especially if your the 10% of the playerbase that is actually decent. You go into matchmaking knowing your going to get bots. It's not fun there is no such thing as a challenge present within the game. I'm F2P in both BS and CR.
---
Cute!
---
Oh hi pow
---
When you ran out of ideas so you get private servers star powers
---
Oh ok. I'm glad lol
---
He already got water. He is crawling from that direction. Also as a 15K player with no legendary brawlers I would take that deal.
---
But my teams piper literally jumped to bulls the whole match
---
Wow man thanks so much
---
Get used to it. Posting on the internet=criticism
---
Well it’s your opinion that Bibi is fine
---
And mine is that she needs a nerf
---
So we can go our separate ways
---
Because you're proud of 500 trophies at level 1. Great job 👍 
---
:)
---
know i'm angry
---
Yes that's true, however factually she doesnt need a nerf.
---
Price to me she needs one, use rational thinking.
---
Thank you Mr VX
---
#MATCHMAKING IS BASED ON HIGHEST TROPHY PLAYER ON THE TEAM
---
You, sir, are a genious. And this is a master piece!
---
sorted by least trophies
---
They should just add that to his super honestly
---
I have been bamboozled and apologize profusely
---
I enjoyed this way more than I should have..
---
I just hit 6500 trophies my name is TheAllyBrawler
---
I would choose Band-Aid over Shell Shock any day.
