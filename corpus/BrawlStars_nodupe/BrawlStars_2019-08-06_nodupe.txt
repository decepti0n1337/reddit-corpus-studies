den he said, "just kidding 9/10" and I fought "dat's fine :)"

Aftew dat episode evewyone kept getting 9/10's and I fewt bad because of de effowts put into deiws compawed to mines, but at de end of de day I weawized we'we just hewe to have fun and waugh about memes. :)

Other star powers work so I just might work there too. If so then she'll never gonna die
---
Yeah but I think it only heals like 5040. Cheif Pat made a video on it I believe
---
I think the first 10/10 meme is the FBI open up meme, and that was a long time ago.
---
It doesn‚Äôt. The mechanics behind it are Shelly getting 5,400 health added, not just ‚Äúfull health‚Äù all healing mechanics are needed as a big boss very severely. As a big boss Shelly you will gain about 1,000 health after dropping to 40% health

Do you even know how matchmaking works? Do some research before you post this crap.

Wait is this just teaming?  \[skeptical face\]

Hmmm ‚ò∫

Just Ignore Crow's Poison

Dude Ik that matchmaking is supposed to be based on the trophies OF the brawler that person is playing with, but I was kind of on a vent because they did really nothing in that match... I should retitle the post to ‚Äúfix matchmaking‚Äù or something. Thanks
---
You missed the "I was born at a very young age"
---
Ya, kinda ...I don‚Äôt usually Team ...I Team When I get teamed ..You know what I mean :)
---
Nice
---
It‚Äôs still not matchmaking‚Äôs fault. It‚Äôs just trophy inflation, causing noobs to excessively main one brawler. Has nothing to do with matchmaking
---
Im saving up on that 449 or 499 legendary deal. I am a F2P player playing since first day since global and I have 360 right now. I've never spent a single gem on token doublers/tickets. I only spent 30 gems on the gold rico skin that eventually turned into loaded rico.
---
Seriously the same comment was also there at the Piper fan art but the word 'penny' was replaced by 'piper'
---
And that's a fact
---
I am a F2P with 360 gems and I've never bought a single token doubler/tickets before. Im almost there
---
It does work. It only heal 540 health. I did it. Its worthless...
---
Lol yes but thankfully not with a bibi
---
Oh sorry, didn't realize it was you. Just that movement during the first countdown was dumb.
---
I hope you get 3,000 upvotes from this. You are amazing
---
I wish. I‚Äôve needed 21 bo points for like a month

Lol

Supercell could've thought of it and not seen that post. It's kinda of a obvious idea for a skin

He actually didn‚Äôt auto aim, I think he tried to attack them but forgot he had the ball

200 coins is pretty good ngl. I wish I got more coins and power points from my 10k box. But I'll get 300 coins from 11k so that's nice

I have that skin and this post just makes me happier

Say sike right now

Congrats!

He's not that great at Bibi so it's believable that you won

Nah I did and who be downvoting my comment

Bye

Hi hello hey heyyah

I agree. I worked hard to max my rank on all brawlers!

Yeah that happens to projectiles sometimes and that was the only one in the air at the moment
---
But summer piper was good....
---
Delet this
---
 I did
---
No joke bought the 50 gem token doubler the day before this came out because I just reached 50 gems and I got depression when I saw the offer, being f2p has its upsides and downsides

Matchmaking ia based on brawler trophies not overall trophies

I think his internet is just horrid and this was meant to be posted at the start of beta

they‚Äôre all like 950 lol

I mean Night mecha crow

I mean even second place when ypu get +8 you get the lose music, that so stupid lmao

You know what's WORSE? You being a thrower hoping it get some tanks to protect you but THEN getting 2 thrower teammates! 
---
 The other team it mortis, Darryl and crow 
---
Its a horrible map for throwers
---
 your teammates are 200 trophies less than you and the other team
---
 
---
They are level 1
---
They are only high up because their older sibling pushed for them

You are at 499 trophies for that brawler

Why did you repost your own old post that already got some recognition?
---
I don't know... I don't think they are demanding they just want new skins because all skins in my opinion are directed to barley, rico and brock and all of them have at least 3 skins. And i feel that the higher rariety brawlers have less skins but ya.
---
Darryl is ok. As a decent tank now. I disagree with piper though. She is a horrible brawler in some maps

Hello i up tick to 500 trophy in level 5 with a technic i love !

Just only triple attack with him, you shoot your 3 attack on opponent then wait the complete reload before attack.

Tick is insame when you play it like that

Comedy of errors

wait are you official?

Your comments are always good I don't get tired seeing them all day

Europe feels big because of the diversity, but tbh it depends what you define as europe. Id you call turkey and russia europe then its huge, matter of perspective i guess? I would also depend on the population density... who knows

(Bob Ross saying nice)

not really
---
I think they‚Äôre bots... all of them are trophy road brawlers, the game probs got confused that 2 lv 1 shelly and nita were in a game (both starting brawlers)

A little strong?

I've seen people shippin' Bibi x Piper, it is confusing

What the Fuck
---
That primo jumped into a world of pain.
---
It was a joke. I saw the exact same text with monika from ddlc. There's nothing to worry about
---
You mean Bibi?
---
It's not a matchmaking issue. It's that they teamed up and didn't care that they had such a huge trophy difference.

Speaking of Gedi-kor, he randomly stop posting

Hell nah! Its enough to get to lvl 10
---
You are right
---
NOT FUNNY DIDN'T LAUGH
---
Coin costs for every level, and power points needed??

Or is there a new currency used to upgrade brawlers?

Awww thanks man neither do I get tired of seeing your beautiful ideas and skins.

Ya and his reload is knda slow
---
This is whats wrong with every gaming community.
---
"Wheres the skins?"
---
People used to advocate for new gameplay. New GAME content.
---
Now all you kids care about is aesthetics.
---
Keep it going. You're only hurting yourselves.
---
mhm
---
Star points :D except not fifty friggin thousand star points probably the same amount coins were from 1 to 10
---
True
---
Nah man it would be star points totally different
---
It‚Äôs like when u play clash royal your enemy try to use log to stop your mega knight from jumping on his princess and your mk jump over the log and land a lethal attack but the crowd start to booing you because his log touched your tower.
---
Crow dead inside

Carl stop stealing all my oil, i need it too!
---
Yes, he was 10th,he deserved that.
---
The dog is just in the background, watching them. Waiting for them to be vulnerable so he can take them out
---
Go so we can destroy them
---
Dude u already need to spend over 5k gold i think? To get to lvl 10 . Not mentioning waiting for the star power , getting the tokens , and if lucky enough get 2k to buy it from the shop .
---
Also if to get to lvl 9 you need 1,200 gold . If getting to lvl 10, 11 can cost alone 2 k for each 0-0 that aint easy for a thing that isnt worth the wait and grind
---
Get this man a christian
---
blame the shelly, not matchmaking
---
That's why I'm saying you'd level past 10 with star points
---
PRIMOOOO!

I said Supercell game lol
---
Oh shit they gonna win Olympic 2020 with that
---
That's what I've always thought. I mean, it's a great game and they are so active.
---
Some people can't even wait a day after an update and they're already saying "when is the new Brawl Talk???". Pf, I wish people could understand. We don't even have those annoying ads in the game.
---
Think about them throwers
---
BIG BRAIN
---
sure why not
---
üòÇ I‚Äôve been filtering posts by new to see how ideas have changed lol

;)
---
Yeah literally the same
---
Both shelly and leon stereotypes I see happen in almost every game, especially leon
---
Synchronized Miking &gt; Synchronized diving
---
Nothing standard works at 800-900 anyway. 
---
People at that range usually only play in teams with people from their club anyway,  hardly anyone gets to 800 under their own merit. 
---
So this is a moot point
---
Ill try to do better, thanks for being honest

What are you? I myself am from Russia and I know about this prefix, Our youtuber created this postscript so that people would recognize themselves, not timing, BLET, This is the most faithful prefix, and if you write this, then you come just to the last picture!

This is related to bs, and stop commenting those
---
What brawler would get this
---
Just stick the word "paying" as the first word in each box and it will make more sense.
---
Dont mind. Im doing the same. Yea i read and it makes a little more sense. Still, coins to gems and gems to coins would be a much more straight forward approach.
---
Really just need the team to see this tbh so if you have the time repost it by all means.

Bro. Sis. Sibling. Please get that emojis are cancer. And don't just say "lmao". Here on Reddit we give input. This is not social media for the fun kids with bright futures ahead of them.

And yes, good ol' classic emoticons are okay in moderation.
---
why post this
---
i didnt . i just needed another skin and he was in the shop to screenshot it :D i only have the mecha crow

Thanks :)

Can I get that on Crow, please?
---
I dont know y but by the time I got to "daddy i pooped" i was laughing super hard thank u sir

Well which brawlers do you think will perform best here?
---
OMG this is crazy so supercell said the update in the fall why are they doing this
---
u/Brawler999
---
Cool idea!!!
---
I would gladly buy skins if I knew that my money was going towards a game with developers who are making an active effort towards achieving optimal competitive play.
---
This task a grueling one
---
It is possible to win, just think a bit more
---
That looks like it'd cause a world of pain if someone had been trapped in the corner.
---
Big brain
---
I agree, this does seem possible.
---
Probably like Shelly and brock
---
Ok good luck with this amazing project

Alright then! I‚Äôll try to work on it this friday night, then when I‚Äôm done I‚Äôll post it on this sub.

What makes you think OP was trying to increase legendary chance with this? This would more be for saving the mega boxes for when the next brawler comes out.

There‚Äôs eleventh in the pic.......?

Yup

That sounds great! Just dont cut school for bs or something like that. That would be some actual bs.

Thank you both for the laughs from this clip and in advance.

That guy is relentless

My favorite part of this SP is actual the visual effects. I feel like I'm shooting a laser cannon out of the bush.

I'm really going to miss those FX if I ever get her second SP, because that one sounds 100% better.

And Gene and Bull?

I mena.. I wasn't saying that's what his intentions were just was stating a fact for those wondering, and I didn't think of that use so you've enlightented me ;}

I don't think they would add that. They want you to buy them because it's *''now or never''*

yes yes yes yes y e s

All the extra speed ones are the same, too. Asset reuse!

Racism and stereotypical

Great idea id like to see my options in battle

Yeah, I‚Äôd agree, their all great on BB, and definitely Primo. Tbf this does look very fun, like a sneaky fields revamp

**I have a discord server https://discord.gg/aB6GHvR**

**I post my early wip artworks there and such things like that**
---
Nah, I don‚Äôt cut school, no worries, I do the workload first and then have fun after. Thanks for the concern though!
---
I hope I‚Äôll be able to make a great guide...
---
Yeah, seems like OP is the kind of guy who rushes the gem spawn with Mortis at the beginning and then dies with all of them.
---
 what I was trying to say is that it could easily be Italian, the word "pene largo" litterally means "wide penis" in Italian. We will never know if the player is Spanish or Italian
---
cOol
---
1 gem for 30 or 50 coins would be fair
---
thank you
---
You will. Dont worry. Good luck on school, too!
---
You made the meme...

---
You need to make a Supercell Id. Apple Id/Game center doesn't actually have much to do with it.
---
Go to Settings and click the Supercell Id button. Create an account, make sure you're logged into it.
---
Then go back to Settings and click the Supercell button again, then click Logout. Then you can create a new id and log in. Now you can easily switch back and forth between the two. You'll need two separate email accounts (not throwaways, you will need access to them if you ever want to log in on another device).

Leon isn't OP anymore and actually relies on sneaking around an assassin, so...

Does it feel good?

Nice now I can flame randoms even more when they don‚Äôt do anything and have ammo ready. üòÇ
---
The only time facing Shelly is balanced
---
You can't compare them. The only thing they have in common is that they slow enemies
---
Most enemies wouldnt die if they ran over everyone and you would have to be suicidal to do that
---
you dont even probably own those Skins, fellow T H I C C
---
Maybe he got too comfortable because he had his super, either way that was a no brain time play right there

Go to the brawl stars page there should be an options tab and hit add user flair
---
Fr tho,
---
Yep
---
Reminds me of epitaph
---
when a mortis with creepy harvest comes and there's another 5 snacks near you
---
Why did I get downboted
---
Ne-ar El primo
---
Wrong subreddit
---
Why?
---
Well I‚Äôm not posting all the same shit non stop bcs just screaming for Leon skins, mortis buffs, band aid nerfs etc. does not do anything and just annoys supercell. They only listen to those bringing good suggestions with good explanations.
---
I think bandaid should heal like 2k or 2.5k hp rather than heal to full

I just found out that he is a 9 year old
---
This is a jojo reference.
---
If they're going to make broken brawlers at least make them legendaries so not every single damn person can use it
---
Immediately deserves my upvote, dunno who tf is downvoting everybody‚Äôs submissions smh
---
I also got star powers much more easily before the summer update. TBH it used to feel like more than 1% now it feels like less.
---
I asked support but they said it's the same
---
gone reduced to athoms...
---
Kkkkk pene largo, os nego inventa
---
this happened for me like 7 times.. because I play this game from beta phases.. but some months I dont play and some months I be addicted
---
I just tried it and it is real
---
It's stupid that the name is even in Brawl Stars...
---
For the one guy who keeps downvoting everyone, go get banned, appreciate other people's work
---
When I see one I target him
---
You literally own this frame my guy
---
If this doesn‚Äôt get in the final film I dunno what will!
---
Wtf, he has just said Ok
---
Sure sir, here is your upvote :)
---
lol back luck

Friend: Piporico isn't real he can't hurt you

Seriously, few people downvote everyone else just because they feel they‚Äôre not as good as them smh

yes, Bibi has a visual indicator for her not-so-game-changing super and star power. There's no reason why Shelly (and others) should be any different. With the introduction of the new star powers Supercell stars to bring a little deep to the game mechanics and we need custom effects to reflect that approach.
---
Thx ;))
---
Nice I don't even have a legendary yet but still nice
---
Asking for upvotes?
---

---
Pathetick

I'd honestly be more than aggravated losing to 3 Dynamikes, it's great that you won. The bonds between Dynamikes grow stronger everyday.
---
Bull at the end be like get away from here
---
SEIY?
---
I kinda feel bad now. He's deleted his whole reddit over this
---
TF2 is really cool, and BS is also a team MOBA class-based shooter game so there's that
---
Other get leon from begin and now you speak like nothing happend? THIS IS ONLY LUCK, i could get all legendarys from the 1 st one man, it donst need numers to write that, ONLY LUCK MATTER
---
bad one.. toooo long range .. like if bull plays here he will like 100% get 10th place .. barely .. 1 not much bushes 2. too and so much water 3.not much walls .... also those one blocks or whatever are boring for the player .. please make another map without these things that I said .. because the map is boring and too longy-range loool

Yeah it happened to me one time, the limit of xp per day is 1000 or up to 1017 xp,

 you can reach 1017 xp by playing a 3v3 and getting star player (at 999 xp)..

Well I got mine from a regular box and I'm still trying to find the other 2 Legendaries because I can hardly get my trophies up with my current brawlers.
---
I‚Äôm Russian and I hate this players too. They‚Äôre very dumb in 3v3 and really annoying in solo SD. They are spinning in solos even on low trophies! This is ridiculous! But we can‚Äôt do anything with that((

Because people can't reason what games you like. People hate Fortnite instinctively so by heart they boo others for mentioning it. I an individual dislike FortNite but that doesn't mean I can't be reasonable with to said game. People now and days can no longer be reasonable. For instance. Your post about the current situation.

How did I never see this???

I think the down voters are color blind lol jk

Banning a brawler just because of one user seems kinda harsh.
---
Seriously though, maybe he just doesn't understand brawl ball.  Or maybe his phone was upside down.  So many valid explanations!
---
Good old Dr. Bill.

Something I wish I had

There is a flair called 'Waiting For 10K' which means everyone can join. That subreddit is made for new 10K players to share their happiness, or when they reach 12K. Or even more. It is not my problem if you can't understand lol.

Why should they be banned? They literally did nothing wrong

How is he not a good brawler???

---
this shelly is so f* stupid, jesus.

whaaaat? I just realized that it is even in my name ... I dont remember that I put it

Nice! Here is an upvote for you.

Everyone can count to 20. Doesn't help a bit
---
98% of this sub won‚Äôt get the brilliance of this. I upvoted, took away my upvote, and then upvoted again. Bravo sir. Bravo.
---
Ikr, I just wanted some power points to upgrade Rico but noo I get Leon, crow, and gene. Like come on
---
They're no longer on vacation
---
As a Shelly main, I would‚Äôve wanted to be that Shelly.

I wish I can give you a gold for that.

This is OP AS FU*K!

Repost no ?

Or you dont know....

Why do mortis did not ate dyna XD

It‚Äôs far from late. You have a lot of time. Judging by previous batches coming out, I‚Äôd say you have like 2 weeks
---
What
---
Same with Bibi's, new Rico's and Leon's, the three of them have the same icon
---
But where do i get the frames that i can draw in, google?
---
This is worth my upvote
---
Pulling that off requires a hell of a lot of skill and luck geez
---
That‚Äôs a terrible idea though. If you know that you will lose and there‚Äôs 5 seconds till countdown, just exit the app and you don‚Äôt lose anything.

Dude it‚Äôs a pinned post lol

I want to upvote, but there's 769 upvotes

oof, thanks

Personally I‚Äôm just going to save mine for future skins... or maybe mecha bo, not sure. I still have a ways to go before I hit (my second) 10k.

Mecha Crow was 100% worth it though.
---
Not really a King. You failes merserable

I did make it higher but I made a post on the brawlstars recruitment page
---
He cant say it if someone else says it first?
---
I think it sorts everyone by what your filters are
---
Definitely not. Imagine if you were a match with all power level 5. Then there would be absolutely no point in power levels..
---
Thank you :) i tried balancing out the map as much as possible to create a map that suits the majority of brawlers well.

This is why if I don't play for like months.
