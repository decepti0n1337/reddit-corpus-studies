Pretty much makes his first main attack Darryl‚Äôs roll
---
---
---
Yep its literally feast of Famine
---

---
1st or 10th
---
#no plz stop this nightmare don‚Äôt bring it back please
---
No
---
 how do u plan on nerfing him? He is one of the weakest brawlers in the game
---
That's the quality of the recording dumbass

A NAO porra devia ser √° tara o ship do mortis a Piper combina no colt COLT X PIPER MORTIS X TARA

–ß–µ —Ç—ã –Ω–∞–ø–∏—Å–∞–ª?
---
I thought about doing something like lol
---
Or just show the bandaid BAR to enemies and teammates
---
What is the point of this post?
---
No nerf
---
Everyone is just rushing or camping
---
Typical day at showdown 
---
I mean solo
---
Then why did you say he was OP
---
Piper with a drink in feast or famine sucks so bad though, wrong timing mate.
---
Why is there a cursor
---
In specific maps
---
ThanksüòÅ
---
This map is actually good for poco
---
Yay in excited
---
Like?
---
Double Shelly
---
No i drew it
---
Hi dynacube
---
Ah yes. At least they did a good job at making them somewhat interesting despite it just being a recolor
---
they haven't removed any for like 10 hours now. They probably haven't gotten around to choosing any more yet. Probably later tonight
---
SHE itself is underperforming in brawl stars actually especially high up in the ladder
---
And thats why they aren't buffing her regular stats instead star powers 
---
Altho bandaid need nerf maybe show the bar to enemies
---
*sigh* Here we go again. Now before you think of me just as a power cube. Let me tell you that 1) I‚Äôll buy you food, 2) I don‚Äôt team, and 3) I Already have friends that are Morti kind. I want peace between our kinds and we can coexist together!
---
The Trophy buff In a nutshell
---
Oki we good
---
Jam
---
Cool!
---
Im your friend now
---
Yeah. I always forget that she has it. It's a very cheap way to buff her. She is still garbage without it and Supercell will nerf it soon
---
Hooray!
---
Since april/19
---
Is Dynamike gang allied with tick
---
I‚Äôm not sure but I think a Youtuber by the name of JK made a video on this.
---
https://youtu.be/iYGL23T1aF8
---
If you go around 1:30 you can see that this could be an Easter egg or I‚Äôm just gullible
---
I believe so, he is a fellow thrower
---
If we are talking about Brawlers without Star Powers, then the whole tier list would be different
---
Tick &gt; mike
---
This is in no way a nerf. It‚Äôs the same area where people can see him, but if this is implemented, you can see how far you should go from the enemy. Big buff for Leon, I don‚Äôt think it should be implemented.
---
Theeeeeeedde First!
---
JAJAJAJAJ que gonorrea
---
The funny thing is I‚Äôm trying to do the exact same thing, but failing
---
K, yeehaa_15
---
What? New skins
---
Thank you so much! ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
I like but I'm guessing it's too much skin for it to actually be allowed into the game
---
Was there a high ranking trophy user on the other side?
---
apparently not
---
So good news the game is working and it seems that all my club had the seem issue .
---
Cuz im pretty sure the person with the highest trophys in a party activates the matchmaking balancer
---
K, CoolGuyTow
---
The nita one will be exploited so badly mate. I will just throw my bear in my base behind a wall so i can have the star power active longer so i can do more damage.
---
Plop him onto the safe
---
10-&gt;3
---
He is weak against all tanks and shot gunners also weak against sharpshooter and throwers every one escapes his range excapet if he corners him
---
So glad the trophy progression was changed. I got my Darryl near 500 before and was for some reason worried I‚Äôd drop if I played him agter rank 20, as if that mattered.
---
Now I play all my rank 20s that I got too easily all I want because if at any point I get them where I can‚Äôt push anymore, I just wait less than a week for the next season reset and do it again.
---
Yeah, rank 20 means nothing now. That‚Äôs okay. I like to not have an irrational fear of playing my 560 Darryl.
---
Something about how the game is free but you can buy stuff
---
Thought I'd give it a shot here is the my frame https://imgur.com/dwXhOpo

If you push all of them to 500 then you will receive 7200 power points

Me how can get only coins

That would lower his skill gap too much. Leon should have some *cough* skill *cough cough* to use
---
Leon regenerates health when he goes invisible
---
Lol you r too dumb an explanation
---
unpopular opinion: poco is one of the best brawlers right now because of the shelly and bibi meta, and the reason he's so op is because of his HEALING star power, and his new one sucks and is only useful in showdown(which poco sucks in anyways)

I don't agree. Star points cool, but for endgame players, not for newbies who don't fucking care if they get literally 0 star points when they could get a box. There is winning in this community, just not with dumb decisions. Add star tokens AND season rewards, everything will be alright.
---
Add season rewards back and leave the star points ingame as well. Literally that easy

---
Maybe if we had season end rewards AND star points together the person above wouldn't make the comment? Why push a brawler over 500 if these star powers literally don't cost shit? They are useless in their current state.

I like both the ideas

In news and go back a few there is the summer update section that tells everything in the update including the star powers
---
This is so complex, it'll never be condsidered. This just seems like too many random ideas thrown into one. Normally the name should be a pun towards the brawler i.e. Gene, he is a genie, or Bibi, she has a baseball (or BB) bat. Simplify this. This is not a good idea.

Thanks and have a good day!:)
---
wOW tHaT sUcKs

I appreciate your effort but a lot of these sound overpowered and also a lot of these are just stats upgrade, which is kind of boring just like most star powers in the game. I hope people can come up more creative or unique star powers such as the jumping dynamike one :D

True, but her natural weakness(close combat) makes her only viable on bounty, where she never needs to be close to people for an objective, and very open maps as an assassin

If the match goes on to 13 minutes 40 seconds, it counts as tie if you don't pick up any gems. We picked a gem accidentally so we were winning by 0 gems but they win by 1
---
Oh shit that's wise.
---
No, they don't need to be away from the team to load band aid, band aid fucks many characters in different ways: ooh a bull vs a shelly? Guess what with the band aid  shelly wins, oh I'm a leon and I chased a shelly with half hp, oh she killed me cause she had band aid, both teams have 9 gems, shelly rushes and doesn't get killed cause of the band aid ooops gotta retake and we die, shelly has 7 stars in bounty, gets hit by 2 shots of piper but oh, she has band aid so she regenerates and barely escapes, shelly is the MOST used character, dont believe me? Check which brawler has more trophies of your friends, and go to rank 20 showdown, only Shelly's, the first character should be easy to use in the start (1000-2000, trophies) but useless when other players get good, the p90 in cs:go, rocket launcher in krunker, victor in paladins, all these things you can get from the start but they become worse and worse, however shelly is the most used

This is a common thing for people who sit at their computers for hours everyday, the blood circulation in their legs gets cut off. To prevent this it doesn't take much. Just do different activities or take time to stretch

"Everyone can get 49 gems for free after playing for about 1 months"
---
"49 Mega Box is way too much value for 49 gems"

"Stop asking for too much free stuff"

Not a copy paste

First of all, that's not how you spell my name. Second, I didn't actually do it. I'm not a sinner. I just made this post for karma. Third, stop advertising on random people's posts.
---
yes, that is a big problem, but matchmaking is made according to trophies, not levels
---
At least we won though.
---
Well no because a team can easily take out a brawler the drink just gives you a fighting chance teaming can‚Äôt be stopped properly and many have accepted that

that's what i'm saying

Oh, this is Barley's new star power!

Ricochet Shot: Barley's bottles, basic attack and ultimate alike, throws another bottle at a random enemy brawler (autoaim) on splash! (Does not trigger if the bottle is a production of the ricochet.)

u/NINJAQkk: Leon, you can now get your super for FREE! Oh and crow, you can deal like an extra 100 damage. Sometimes.

what is this a reference to?

I think that‚Äôs the default limit

well it nicer than 30 gem skin I got bored of it so I bought this one

Teach me

So rare

Wow the bullets look like a tick version bullet bill from mario
---
I've been playing this for 1 year now, you can't buy skill with money. Salty...
---
This is what happens when kids want to add things to games. Basically all of these are OP and would ~~disrupt~~ destroy the game's balance.
---
I like where this is going
---
Select brock with his fourth rocket star power then quickly select Carl and press ready while the icon is brock and done, it takes practice but you will get the hang of it
---
How are you at 9387 with only 4500 star points
---
Congratulations
---
Wham bam here comes Jess!
---
Wym?
---
I spent a total of 3000 on skins, and I only recently got my first rank 20 brawler (shelly). All my other brawlers are rank 16-19.
---
How about a "friendly" match between us? Then we Will see Who has skills or not how about that?
---
r/sbeve

Oh okay, I haven‚Äôt spend any star points and I‚Äôm at 9750 with 8500 star points... saving for something idk what though
---
His?
---
El primo is way too op
---
I only have been playing for two months and have star powers for Shelly and Jessie.
---
You decide which brawlers you want to focus on and spend only the coins to upgrade them. Then whenever points come in the store you purchase the points with coins for them.

An epic Penny with 7000+ health and 306 coims per burst/coin pack

Are these the new Star Powers?

I like how your name is Moorrrtttiiisss, but your user flair is Dynamike :p

Just buy it

looks like globglogabgalab more for me

If you going to the hot post in r/brawl stars you can see my postü•≥ü•≥
---
If your a squishy brawler you almost 100% dead. But if your a tank your probably good unless the leon has a lot of power. Keep in mind sometimes you can hear the leon going invisible so I always try to play with sound on showdown at least.
---
Sure link?
---
Looks like goth and rock mix gone wrong no offence but piper needs a remodel first before these skin ideas can be made well.
---
Makes sense to me
---
ya, i saw it few hours ago and i saw it in hot post few minutes ago and i was shocked that the upvotes increased so rapidly

#wowww!!!I LOVE the new remake of ricochet!!!!!!!!!!!(coughing)

---
El Habanero is just an overpowered version of Berserker
---
Get buffed my guy
---
Me too
---
I guarantee you that all of these star powers would break the game if they ever got in. That being said most of these bring out the most annoying traits in each character and just to put this into perspective it‚Äôs essentially like giving everyone Shelly‚Äôs Bandaid
---
maybe just 50% slow
---
It means "attack" in Turkish
---
And I am Turkish
---
Getting a star power is like getting a brawler: it can only happen once per box (10 times per mega box, etc.) meaning the chances do not stack. Still, it is recommended you don‚Äôt buy any star powers until all your brawlers are power 9.
---
What?
---
i wanna know too
---
I'm a little unsettled that they gave a robot a human skin color
---
I constantly play showdown, and if I‚Äôm not a bull, or a brawler with double his power cubes, and they surprise attack, then I die almost immediately

Bad manners- used to describe intentionally obnoxious behavior. Players may BM in order to frustrate or irritate the opponent, to gloat and revel in their victory, or simply to drag the game out and inconvenience the opponent as much as possible.

Damn they left jessie naked

Hol' up

As a jessie main i can confirm this is correct we tryhard so hard we move too fast for the average player to notice that we use ukuleles

Yes brock have 4 skins and what about crows 5 skins

What does the 50 mean????

Stolen art gets 1k upvotes. Message to moderators: u dumb

It's probably just 3 friends that just decided to play as a team of all colts.

---

Id doesn't HAVE to be unique, but it's at a lower priority. What happened is there were no other players at that trophy range to match with a colt, so it matched him with another 2 colts..

Search online: el primo meme template, Nita bear meme template etc.

Then you go to google drawings, make your meme and download it as a png. You then post that png on reddit.

No, in gem grab, you can make the final kill in the last second and win the game. In heist you can hit the safe and win by 1%. It should only work in bounty

Ur probably right...Well time to be a bo main than.

I think poco's was that all his fans left him and he spends his days making riffs or something.

Don‚Äôt be mean, there are artists here.

Thank you very much !

Thank you so much!^ ^

Damm, he gets nerfed in all ways, lower hp, lower dmg, and higher rarity meaning he is harder to obtain.
---
That Jessie looks like she's about to commit some war crimes
---
Np I love these star powers very imaginative and unique
---
Ik but there are recolor of skins so for 30 gems skins it cost 500 star point and for 80 gems skins 2500 (but its too expensive for 80 gems)
---
To make it look better than it already is, try to make the joints less visible, the fingers less pointy, and if your drawing Carl, make his helmet and eyes bigger.

There‚Äôs no rucking difference ones just left to right that‚Äôs it

Sorry to say but this post probably will get lost in new. These ideas have already been floated, but to no avail. I suggest getting a discord! You can do voice calls with your in-game friends when you‚Äôre playing to coordinate games. It‚Äôs a great tool.
---
This is automatically equipped on all Pipers I thought.

You weren‚Äôt supposed to give it to anyone in the first place. You can contact supercell support but I doubt they would do anything because sharing supercell ID‚Äôs is a bannable action anyways

It was not even they who invented, these abilities were in the game
---
A lot of these are insanely overpowered, but the concepts are good. With some number tweaking many could be viable.
---
I think you are severely underestimating how strong stuns and slows are in a MOBA game like this. Being hit by a slow or stun often means instant death, as it basically paints a huge target sign on you and everyone in the world will instantly shoot you because they know you can't dodge.
---
Shelley's is by far one of the most overpowered, it's literally her original Star Power except now it's applied to her normal attacks too. And most people can testify that getting hit by her original Star Power already often meant you were dead meat. 2 seconds is a VERY long time in a game like this.
---
Still, good ideas should be upvoted, so here you go.

There is a daily experience limit?
