But you got the best one tho.

Nope, the best's Spike

No. You can invite 6 peoples to playing with you.

Is it me, or this feel like every tf2 class fighting the bread soldier keep teleporting

#DAMN IT SOLDIER
---
That‚Äôs the game algorithm for you. If the game sees that you don‚Äôt play as much, it will secretly up your luck chance without visually changing the numbers to hopefully give you more brawlers to have more incentive to play the game
---
Could be better with more salt üßÇ
---
It's better to have a bull in there with escape super but shelly works pretty well
---
Frank is a hard-hitting dude, and a real physical specimen. His Super will shock and awe!

More likeable at the bo skin

All i can imagine now is Pam as a T H I C C Mercy

# COINCIDENCES

Thanks, dude :)
---
I ain't complaining, but pro tip to get a legendary, quit for like thr hours months then come back, works 100% of th time
---
Your mother did not give birth to you so you can misspell a meme about a mother giving birth.
---
One time I played boss fight, I got a Poco. Poco took all the power cubes and we lost miserably. After that, got salty and played again. Then played with the same poco for #2 more games
---
I think not ü§î
---
Not really :/ he's pretty weak and you'll get the best of him from up close which is hard without bush camping :(
---
Did I misspell something?
---
 I already killed a Darryl and a Dynamike as Piper.  Both had 25 Power Cubes.
---
Ok mr. no-dps and gets killed by the spawning bots while trying to kite boss
---
That timer is for when the next event will change
---
Yea, it‚Äôs a theory but a pretty logical one. I had two friends test it. One quit for about a week, came back, then got Bibi in his first brawl box. Other friend quit for a couple days, came back, then got Tara. Obviously not as good as Spike, but you get the idea
---
Not enough dps and too squishy for expert+
---
Look!! He is good for u too. 7-7

---
Wow. So much pain in this pic. I can only imagine the rage.
---
That‚Äôs some amazing artwork but how will her regular attack look like? It can‚Äôt be three lasers because her regular attack takes a little to get from Point A to Point B
---
What the hell is that knockup time?
---
Maybe for leon a sight reduction so instead of seeing him in a 3 tile radius it's a 2 tile radius
---
That‚Äôs going to be difficult as there is no global chat in brawl
---
This is so true
---
The bot was scared days why he jumped
---
The wiki says that the speed for the assasins is 820, tanks 770, and normal brawlers 720.
---
All speeds where buffed during the 3d environment update.
---
And anyone who thinks WIKIPEDIA IS A RELIABLE SOURCE NEEDS TO RETHINK THIER LIFE. why do u think when u were in school teachers said to stay away from wiki?
---
Fuck off.

I got my first star power after 2 boxes when I got penny to lv9, thought it's not that hard to drop.  
---
My next star was around 40-50 boxes after that one. Now I have 2 more lv9 sitting for months waiting to get a star.  
---
The real wonder is that I never get a legendary hero after all this time. ( I'm at 3,750 trophy) Though I just got the last heroes (except legendary) 2 days ago.
---
Just a quick correction from a Spanish-Speaker. I would be more like El Primo Futbolista
---
Did you just say that Rosa needs a BUFF?
---
And that Bibi DOESN‚ÄôT need a nerf?
---
Bibi is the best brawler in the game and definitely needs a small nerf.  Rosa needs a range nerf, but that‚Äôs all.
---
Idk what buff to give Dyna tbh
---
well, it's intended to be like that
---
But all you have do is get 6th in showdown then your good
---
Just got it today and got a quadra kill clean up through a wall in Duo sd
---
You could have used my template.
---
 ô Ä·¥ú ú
---
Damage.  Buffing his damage wouldn‚Äôt affect the interactions with lost brawlers he counters, but it would help him counter more brawlers.
---
Or alternatively getting his super with 1 less swing.
---
Piper is in no way a city girl... She dresses like wild west sharpshooter Annie Oakley without the cowboy hat, and talks like a southern belle. Might wanna double-check that one chief

Lmao so I started opening up boxes. I went through 10 big boxes, I got nothing. I go through 10 small ones, I get nothing. My 11th box, I get Mortis. My 12th box I got Tara lmaoooooo. I got them consecutively and I can‚Äôt stop wheezing, ty for encouraging me to open them üòÇ. The only brawlers left for me to get are all three legendaries, let‚Äôs see how long that takes ü§™

Bo is pretty good until you get insane. About 2000 damage per shot and the mines can really do something on the boss.

Dune drift was toxic with teamers before now its better than before.Passage still sucks due to no event modifier and teamers.

---
Dawg it‚Äôs raiden
---
balance the amount of stupid randoms pls.
---
Okay stop messaging me
---
Some people are just too dumb for this game
---
A little bit complex for a brawler design but seems fine to me; however I want to tell you that:
---
1) the floor does not conduct electricity in a wavelike manner. It would be more suitable to say he creates an electrical explosion that sends electric shockwaves thru the air
---
2) star power should be called fatal leak, as it seems suitable that he would start leaking electricity due to his damaged body
---
3) Eyes! So far every brawler has at least one visible eye! The whole body seems a little bit more like a mecha skin, maybe make him a little more cyborg or human?
---
4) for a sharpshooter like brawler his health is DANGEROUSLY low with DANGEROUSLY SHORT range. Truth is, he should be at least 4000 with something like Tara‚Äôs range. Stunning for 0.3 is in fact VERY OP so I suggest he be a ranged tank with long range that requires good aim, low damage like Nita but with stun effect of 0.1 second, with about 1.5 second reload. This would be a bit underwhelming but requires a lot of skill to use.
---
In conclusion, it is already pretty good but with a little bit of appearance and stat change, this can be even better!
---
Howd u get past insane II im stuck lmao
---
Sure buddy.
---
So you are the wise Bo
---
I understand and agree that it‚Äôs not all the time when you get put with people outside of your range, but supercell should set sort of brackets e.g 300-325 brawler trophies match up , to make sure you are not on somebody‚Äôs team who has like 100 trophies less than you
---
Especially when you have to wait hours for a new event.

Haha same
---
it means theres teamers
---
Obviously, they were bad or I wouldn‚Äôt of been this frustrated. You can easily tell if it‚Äôs a mini or not. Not hard to spot
---
HELLO it's me the maker oof. Anyways on the attack please don't start a fuss I just wanted to say that his attack only pushes them.back every 4 attacks but unfortunately I forgot to type it in because I'm just that BLIND OOF. but yeah.
---
Also his super animation last for about 3 seconds making him a easy target but kinda dangerous at the same time like frank.
---
So the damage will be done from his super and the stun but only to brawlers in range so if a brawler is out of range nothing will happen to them and they can get a quick fast easy snack/kill out of ya.
---
Ammo: 3
---
Movement speed: a tiny bit faster than Brock's.
---
Reload speed: 3.2 sec for each bar.
---
His super takes about 11 shots to fully charge up.
---
I can't even find a bo anymore bc of bandaid and all the shellys
---
She still does enough dmg against the boss &amp; the little bots and she is also one of the brawlers which can interrupt the laser attack of the boss. Didnt tested it out but band-aid could also be a + point.
---

---
He's tier B in duo showdown (if you play on solo and manage to be second without using the survival strategy at all consistently over 500 trophies you're literally god), if you're good you still won't make kills, but will rather make everyone low and then they'll regen and try to take you down again. Everyone goes for poco in showdown, and your teamates usually overestimate you capability of surviving alone. 
---
He's somewhat good in brawl ball, about on 40% of the maps, 50% of gem grab, about 30% in bounty, where he can be good because of his heal (and maybe the only mode his first starpower may be better than the second)
---
One of his starpowers does need a buff/nerf. They should both be just as good.
---
He's sometimes decent in siege, he usually gets pushed to the side trying to kill his aggresor, and can't reach his teamates with his heal because of that. He also doesn't do almost any damage to the robot.
---
He's more bad than he's good. He deserves at least a small buff.

Nita has her Hyper Bear Star Power. Don‚Äôt know if it is useful or not, but I use the bear for more temporary DPS. I always put the bear behind or beside the boss when he is about to attack. 
---
So, you can say it‚Äôs not a good brawler to use, but most of my brawlers are not maxed anyway. Plus, I was getting most of the Power Cubes, so my bear did like, more than 1000 damage per swipe towards the end. I died, but the bear finished it off.
---
Nice job man, hope you get legy soon!

#MUSICAL MAYHEM
---
I imagine a genji mortis skin, and the bats become the dragon
---
I think they should make it a more gradual heal, like 1000 hp per second and increase the charge time to 25-30s, since previously what made Darryl op was his super that charged in 20s. With the nerf to 30s, Darryl dropped in viability.
---
Because it will add more connection to the player. Something to look at other then the current menu page. Why do we need brawlers that are connected to each other such as Barley and Rico when you can‚Äôt see them together?

This is probably an old screenshot of when replays weren't playable at all, so I think your lying.
---
Never have I ever been in or seen a fight in the bottom left corner.
---
I‚Äôve acc been thinking about them adding an angel brawler but nvm üòÇüòÇ
---
really? Misterious identity? He is an assassin but he needs a voice
---
I sorry I'm think of something else... it was the wide map similar to dune drift?
---
Once it's two players left, the mushrooms stop spawning. So if ppl were attacking each other until the end, the last person standing from that should win, since he wouldn't just be standing in the poison like the other player.
---
Your post has been removed, make sure to use the body of a post to elaborate on the title.
---
You didn't win 10 trophies back then tho
---
Eye of the storm is awesome. What are your issues with it? The only problem for me is the middle is kinda bland, but other than that, it's pretty good.
---
Why doesnt he need a buff then?
---
Yes... MUCH more than I expected...üòÇ
---
Sure !!!
---
Go ahead and wish you all the best
---
Why Supercell couldn't add that?
---
Why don‚Äôt they add a bar that lets you see your teammates atk recharge?
---
Bcus in team u can only add 3 players but randoms u can play with alot players
---
Believe what you want
---
The areas listed on the left are the places/themes which we could expect new brawlers to come out based off of those themes

Tnx
---
This is not inspired. You just copy copy pasted all of this. And this background sucks. Like a lot
---
In the other modes, respawn is faster, so there is no need for that
---
Thanks for being honest ‚ù§
---
It shouldn't be just a menu background, it should be way mote interactive and at the same time we need space for lobby so the current menu is fine now but i would say this can be the game mode selection screen, current one is just 4 game modes in 4 boxes and a fifth one floating below them, instead of those, if this map could work and the ongoing game mode should be marked in the map referring that "this game mode takes place here" like that. You know just like clash royale war card collection day island
---
Hmm... Probably River Rush (long time ago showdown map)
---
u/uwutranslator
---
You can invite 9 players to play friendly showdown, why not invite to play Robo Rumble?
---
Ow ow iw i detect pure anger also wtf wrong with you
---
Maybe it can zoom in to the part of the map your playing in
---
Oh ok means it will expand the player thing so 3 players to 9 players?
---
Oh
---
Sure, no problem with that. :)
---

Nice trickshot. Also, this is the shortest game I've ever seen!!
---
Ricochet top

Its cool

Not at all, it will feel more like a supercell game if they add this, since clash of clans opens with your village as the menu screen

For all users who don't believe this!When you don't have 400 trophies instead "replay" you will see this "replays is unloked at 400 trophies" but in my screenshot writes "no replay avaleble yet".

True

The last thing of trophy road should be your choice between the legendaries
---
Yeah maybe that's what it was idk but it was a pretty balanced map overall for all brawlers
---
Shrank
---
They are probably playing in a team... so its fairer to play against enemies according to the highest trophy player, instead of the lowest. Don‚Äôt u agree? I would suggest to team only with players within a 50 or 100 trophy range.. so many games have been ruined cause of this
---
No
---
Maybe every game mode that is currently available can be a different island and you can choose from there which mode you want play??
---
I don't see something good here
---
Inspired by skylanders , i just haven't place where write it... sorry üôÉ

Don't do kids, drugs

Oops i post something exactly similar just now except mine was less creative  :') you did a really good job

Why not? Spike is the strongest legendary right now, im glad I have him.
---
I don‚Äôt mind Shelly mains but if you only use her then I have a problem
---
But he's in Retropolis
---
3 shelly is better
---
It‚Äôs not toxicity if it‚Äôs true and nothing special. It‚Äôs a Shelly. Trophy inflation makes nothing special about this. Try pushing a mortis to feel special.
---
How did you do this ? WITCHCRAFTERY
---
I SWEAR i never seen any thrower in cavern Churn 
---
Once in a blue moon i see tick

The original trophies that were there was 8777, I just edited the 877 out and left the 7

I'm on the weird side of this subreddit

2: dont use siege size maps for anything but siege

3: 3 spawn points, not 5

4: only 1 safe on each side

5: the map must be symmetrical or it will be imbalanced.

look at the first one and tell yourself whats wrong with it.
---
then draw a second one. 
---
then draw a third one with the second ones mistakes. 
---
its a pain in the ass but i guarantee you the third one is significantly better than the first
---
Lily and cleon

I played 550 Bo and many other 500+ brawler and have not seen a single thrower

They had us in the first half not gonna lie

But you said the best brawler

KairosTime has a Reddit account himself and several art post got way less attention but did put in a lot of effort, he just took a screenshot of someone elses video and gets karma.

Thats why I don't use Tara a lot. With this amazing buff idea this may encourage me to play her more! I hope this comes soon!

I main him rn tho

Nope. I was just one of the 1k or so watching you desperately spin to save yourself.

Wouldn't work in a competitive game like brawlstars

i never understood that handwriting, but nice job there

Well new game mode 2 v 2 v 2 v 2 v 2 v 2 v 2 v 2 v 2

You have to wait some time

this is way worse after the recent throphy change. Losing 6-7 trophies does not matter that much anymore

Balanced??
---
Nigga, there are only Bulls, Shellys and Rosas in this map, you can't even choose any other Brawler bc they fuck you
---
If you choose a rico or Mortis (example) the campers will fuck you too:/
---
That thing.... st.. still hurtsüòü
---
Well reality isn't always formed around "suggestions" go be lonely elsewhere
---
Also, Bibi Fits Sans Too because of her speed, her cool personality etc...
---
Maybe a slight polish to his model like Frank, but yea skins and a voice are a must!
---
Yeah... but the speed is mostly from star power.. and sans special attack is ‚Äúnothing‚Äù... and crows poisen doesn‚Äôt do that much..

Maybe shang mortis since shang sounds cool first

Mortis is going to have a fantastic dinner.
---
That's was and my question =))
---
Ok, so how do I stay relevant when I'm only doing chip damage?
---
Just annoy people by chipping them, and once their health is low then start to get closer

Thinking to yourself: ‚ÄúAm I stupid?‚Äù

My first brawler i got to 500 is also shelly

And good clan 2 win, the clan and anti-hero weapons are op

Another problem is when you're right at the VERY END and you're the only one alive, and they get you. Boss is almost destroyed and they kill you. I swear just I want to start thowing shit right now
---
They should do mini showdown tournament. The whole thing last about 20-30 mins total time.
---
Gem or open siege maps. She‚Äôs beastly on a few siege maps.
---
Dang! Is the small lines used for the shading watercolor too? Or did you use pen/copic or something?
---
i used to play
---
&gt;Ok so you're talking about 3v3, 
---
Well, duh. There's like 5 3v3 modes and only two other modes. Isn't 3v3 the lion's share of the game?
---
&gt;, in that case gem grab is good for pam... 
---
Well yeah. But according to most tier lists, she's pretty much competitive in every mode. I was kinda hoping for more all-around advice about how she fits into a team, regardless of mode specific objectives.

I scroll through this sub sometimes. It's just some porn. You don't mind it after a while. Like I said, there is some solid artwork there. There is porn of Overwatch and other hero based games and no one really minds it. The thing with Brawl Stars is that it's a mobile game. Many people look down to it. This makes this sub whole existince even more cringy for many people.

And im brazilian so i dont understand any f*%@ng thing that you said.

Can you make one with New Super Mario Bros. Wii Sounds? Or Mario Kart wii and play carl or something?

The problem is that there is people that make those

Huh? You're aproaching me?

But when you kill it..

700 gold. Fuck off üòÇ

My first comment ever , thanks mate!

Matchmaking is based on trophies of the brawler not the power level

I don‚Äôt see what you could possibly be complaining about here

Chief Pekka is famous

No it isn't. You're just saying that because he said his play was better.

Don't take these downvotes seriously because most of this sub is filled by 11 year old kids who can't even think properly.

Dude you just singlehandedly made me reach 1000 trophies with carl thank you
---
Cute
---
And you were so slow the last brawler that you played says a cringy voice line out loud. Imagine hearing "WHAM BAM HERE COMES PAM" in a public place. Awkward

So she just said nobody the whole time? Wow

Dude you're in a game with Patchy

To you it is. But the funny thing about opinions is they're all different.

Now Mortis will be too op in brawl ball

Yeah dude, I actually got downvoted for saying cavern churn is the worst map and that some brawlers dont need buffs (and a gave a rational reason too)
---
But yeah I dont really care about downvotes because it's common for people who make sense to be downvoted.

I love your name
