Yes
---
---
---
Dont get me wrong, jessie is a great utility brawler, and her turret is amazing cc, with the health buff it makes using first star power really viable, but... she's not really that strong even with the projectile speed buff
---
Joji&gt;Filthy Frank
---
Oh god,oh fuck,the brawlstarscactus is here!!
---
The best ideas (4 ideas) 
---
1.Takedown rework
---
Now is ticket event and instead of dealing damage to the boss the boss will be just like in boss fight insane 3 (you can bet tickets) you and other players (10 players vs boss) (the same rules as boss fight but maps big as showdown maps)
---
You can play it in friendly game
---
2.you can play other ticket events in friendly game
---
3.star token doubler(ammount 18)price 40 (when is not on discount) 29 when in discount
---
4.star token doubler even it will double every star token no matter the event it will rotate for every mounth with the double token event
---
Lol stop upvoting this, I'm just reporting this thief
---
Highly unlikely. If you were maxed out on power points, you would not receive this offer due to the game giving you offers based on what you need.
---
Okay, thank you very much
---
I promise you it happen a few times
---
But then it becomes a hybrid between poco, emz and piper
---
ive done that like twice before
---
Piper should be wise, she literally a princess from a rich family maybe
---
feel better yet rookie
---
Oof
---
Same
---
yeah.
---
11K trophies

Why is that an oof?

Spike isnt getting a voice... Its already been confirmed

Why are you keep putting ‚ÄúXD‚Äù XD

That's why they are in a paradox

Because I'm extremely awkward...XD

Seriously i had seen this shit posted a million times in the sub kid.

I know. I was simply stating a fact.

I guess you‚Äôre right... XD

Tick went ultra instinct mode

Thx 4 understanding

This is super cool! I love both these games so this is an awesome crossover to see.

1k is too much. Maybe buff it to 500

Oh no not again

Sorry but, aren‚Äôt good ideas
---
The thing is this guy's editing is one of the best in the brawl stars funny moments thing. But i agree that click bait for funny moments are ridiculous. Btw thie guy is mobile arcade
---
But dynamites will barricade themselves and the game won‚Äôt end
---
I mean I guess but it's all I could think of posting I'm not too creative üòï
---
I agreed the whole time that they don‚Äôt play perfectly, my point was that it‚Äôs still entertaining because they are the best in the game, you said it‚Äôs not as entertaining because of misplays
---
Well yeah I said that this is already enough for once a year thing cuz theres so much loot
---
ok but they were in a paradox
---
Leon damage is extremely high

Thanks :D

Did you find the cost for it??

WTF
---
This is why lone star sucks. Kill stealing.
---
Bro I got penny at 3k trophies
---
Me too, fellow internet explorer user
---
How yu do this
---
Supercell won‚Äôt give away that much free stuff
---
A new TH should be the rarest one
---
The secret ingredient is lag
---
Thats why i said a small detail. you can do that, i just felt like it would be nice
---
Neat
---
It‚Äôs big brain time
---
What is this
---
And his pull could be a hook!
---
Primetime baby!
---
I would by this skin no doubt about it, great work ü§©
---
But then you'd be giving up the better star power in most cases
---
It is Real?
---
gei
---
Your going to hell
---
no.
---
Time for trouble!
---
Not everything get reset when a ball is score. Entities, like turrets and players, get reset but attacks, in this case barleys main attack, don‚Äôt.
---
Why if they accept you can remove them if it really matters. And best case they deny it
---
I would say this is r/karmaroulette
---
Miss the old El primo
---
Stoned rico\*
---
How will the game detect that a brawler barricaded themselves? Also if they got in they can get out.

Life can really suck some times &amp; we both know it. One thing that makes me feel better during hard times is that we often grow &amp; learn most when we struggle.
---
In my experience, if you do your best to be nice to others without being too hard on yourself for your mistakes, you'll pull through it as a much better person than before. You may find yourself happier too!
---
Whatever you're going through, I hope it all turns out &amp; you have good people around you üëç
---
Yes it is TH 12 came last year, and Supercell (clash of clans) announced a new TH every year starting last year
---
They only had gold ones. That would be so cool!
---
Well you can't really call 2 years in a row being every year.

Brawl Stars was made to be a competitive TEAM game where completing the objective takes priority, I mean the game doesnt even have kill assists ffs, so taking a game like this which was balanced around specific TEAM comps and making it a FFA Deathmatch doesnt work imo
---
Idk wtf you people are conplaining about. Like what are you gonna do with 1 more second of invisibilty.
---
Thxxx!!!

Hey Lex what do u think will be your next 1000 brawler

As a leon player this is the funniest thing ive ever seenüòÇüòÇ

nice idea

Eh..si, purtroppo si
---
Thanks

Nice detail!

Bro u need a mint

Thank you, and it's okay if you don't know how to play everyone just needs to practice

yeah no worries

Welp now I know lol it looked legit! I got all excited üòÖ well I beat them real good if it makes you feel better lol

Now this is an interesting skin

It's a vibrator

I'm calling it, Brawl Talk on Monday Dec 9

This is beautiful! Nice shading :D
---
thats nowhere near the fastest showdown game

rolly and best boi

I need more time in practice with bots, the problem for me is how slow charges and the damage with the distance

No. This is perfect.

If you mean for phone,i recommend Kinemaster or Power Director.
---
11,5k, only got spike a week ago. No other legendaries
---
You have to be present at the end of the match
---
Yeah the community‚Äôs been begging for a report button. I‚Äôm actually getting good vibes that it could be the next update they give up a report button. I think another thing they could do is have people who go afk mid match be banned from random match making and can only play in Solo mode or with a team
---
No one noticed the 8-bit that tried to clear a bush when it was 3 people remaining?
---
Fr

Yeah lol

She is not OP Not that much

Sweet that is good news I guess!

Darryl is meditating beyond the force

Now, he is too dangerous to be kept alive.

*gives tick fiut cummy*
---
Let's go

Or just chose the maps that this is not possible
---
Also, tick     ticket
---
I like the idea of a Christmas reward calendar thing... And it would be good to have at least -ONE- brawliday skin!
---
And what is the bad even most of the community think that is good idea also
---
Maybe you dont want more star tokens
---
And im not the only one that request this idea
---
I know I will at least searate it okay
---
Kairos finally got a GoldMecha Bo, guess all that grinding paid off
---
Or is he...
---
Really Leon is so easy to get why do people say he's hard to get??????  I got Leon at low trophies... Lower than 1000 ! Why people... WHY? oh maybe it's because you say: "I better get LEON in this box..." You won't unless you say: "I have Leon already!" Literally... Think Positive and you will get anything you want!
---
Seems way too broken
---
r/redditsings
---
So, not really a buff? It has a nerf included.
---
# DAB
---
Sorry... But it's not true. I got Leon when I was less than 1000 trophies and off didn't have any star powers!
---
I just hated when i get 1 or 2 hard earned stars and then watch your teammate die 4 times.
---
Poco nerf? Why?
---
U DON'T HAVE PRIMO?!
---
I played a tick and he was definitely hard to deal with
---
I have a post from 2 years ago on this subreddit, does that mean I deserve three legendaries too?
---
Well he did. Haha 9/10. üòÖ
---
Am I seeing Paw Patrol?

I have mortis instead.

Not sure how it's possible but it's gotten worse lately. I get marched with low 400's all the time and I have 600 level brawlers. It's almost unplayable
---
It so ok
---
50000 the skin is too good to be cheap
---
Takedown needs a rework for sure, but honestly, I play it quite a bit (as it should be played, no killing other players) to push Bull and Pam every season and it works wonderfully. Not the most fun, occasionally frustrating, but not the worst IMO. That "honor" definitely goes for Lone star, which is the most bullshit, unfair and frustrating crap in the game by a long shot.

The big brawler's name sounds kinda familiar to me..
---
It‚Äôs actually buff‚Äôalot and he needs to be nerfed some more.
---
Yes he is
---
I see battle passes as an easy cash grab tho because the free rewards are usually annoyingly useless and even if you buy it chances are you won't even get all the rewards. It also makes the game more of a grind.

I dont know sally leon is cute but warewolf is cool

What was the reward?

Amazing

Should be not 1075 but 1260 because is a Max. Sandy attack (sorry for bad English)

There is a solution search it up on youtube

That‚Äôs what it looks like. FFS the Bo was walking into ticks mines. I wouldn‚Äôt waste my time playing with OP either. 
---
And this post is exactly why there will never be a report button.
---
Oh shoot it‚Äôs my favorite content creator :)
---
Yeah..can‚Äôt unlock one in 14k
---
It‚Äôs because you suck. The Brock didn‚Äôt feel like wasting their time. I mean, you literally walked into ticks mines and your movement made it super easy for piper to snipe you.
---
You die seconds after respawning because you just walk into the line of fire and commit suicide.
---
Takedown is actually alright at high trophies when everyone focus on the bot. But occasionally there will be some pipers, jessies, crows and emz there to ruin your life lol.
---
Yeah Lone Star is trash, meta is very stale. LEON or MORTIS. Sometimes piper, crow, gene. Other than that I don't see other brawlers at all. And it's so RNG, sometimes you can get 1st because you got lucky or you can get 8th because all your kills get stolen or you had a really bad start. It's stupid.
---
Worst 3v3 is siege, randoms don't even know how to play siege, they're expert at dying.
---
user name check out
---
I love this idea! Another star power could be that it does not get slowness after teleporting. Also, what is the brawler‚Äôs movement speed and rarity?

None, This should be a reason why SuperCell should add a report button.

What it means? Just a game with a new update it isnt brawl stars

But it will be nerf for power boxes, safes, Turets from siege, and all robots.

Say there are only two is remaining in Showdown. You both have 200 HP(Definitely one-shot range) and you shoot each other, but your bullet comes first, thus you are the first, despite being dead after a few moments. This post related only to showdown.

That‚Äôs... a great idea! Ok i will

bruh im talking about the GOOD skins, ya know the season exclusives
---
btw my % are 0.1120 for legendary brawlers, i have all brawlers unlocked (except the legendary ones obviously) so i don't get boring easily

new brawlers are good and everything but no a priority, like you can unlock brawlers all year and for free, that's no the case with skins

Tilting.

Haha true. Love the drawing of Leo

he is right though. nobody cares about op's life.

Supercell doesn‚Äôt care when you have bad players on your team, if they did they would fix the matchmaking.

I respect your opinion.
---
Ahh yes, the good old days when i was watching cartoon network, now it has been ruined by the abomination in the name of teen titans go

Either way it's just cosmetic. 109 is a good deal for the skin, but it's whether or not you care for the skin and want to buy it.

r/TheBrawlStarsCactus

I don‚Äôt know what is this but I like it
---
No I‚Äôm Dutch but I‚Äôm obsessed with Russian dances and musicüòÇ
---
Average and obvious play. Other teams sucks for not realizing.
---
I'll be getting it in a few days after Power Play!
---
:l Yoda Spike
---
o k
---
Jeez this is against the rules that not talking bout' BS and other app.
---
‚Äúwe‚Äôre 1 star ahead, lets push forward‚Äù
---
Same Same Same here
---
Damn I forgot.
---
And when she jumps, the wings could come out!
---
This cool and all but copyright
---
I feel the same way. Whenever there is takedown I play like 20-30 matches with piper,colt,bull,Pam and I get like 200-250 trophies instantly.... Takedown is low skill gamemodes but it is good for grinding trophies.on the other hand when there is lone star then I just play it for the star tokens and didn't play it for the rest of the day
---
my english is bad sorry ;-;
---
Bruh
---
2 words my bad
---
Oh, right
---
i agree with all of these except sandy. i think sandy's pretty balanced now after all his nerfs
---
I'm pretty new to Reddit, how did you get the "Rico" next to your name?
---
Totally agree üòÖ
---
:l
---
Oo t√ºrk

Minecraft not dying totem and 8-Bit Extra Life
---
Wow brings a tear to my eye
---
Wow every art you make are beautyfull as always!
---
omg.
---
This is me, 2 days ago, shooting boss while dodging 8 Bit and Piper shot XD
---
There's a good chance this is unique! I checked 83,869,514 image posts and didn't find a close match
---
The closest match [is this post](https://redd.it/bzsg9r) at 57.81%. The target for r/Brawlstars is 86.0%

"Yes,it was"
---
Brawl ball or bounty
---
What about disable season reset option
---
So you wont lose trophyes every season
---
Yeah I made it on my phone.
---
The game is way too popular for the devs to just leave it to dry like that
---
Meh
---
At 13.5K now
---
And I Also find poco is typing like dead man.
---
Also good idea !
---
No...
---
Ha! Not even close. I don‚Äôt main anyone because I‚Äôm not stupid. In fact, right now Emz is tied for my lowest trophies of any brawler. Try again, sweetheart
---
Wow, such empty
---
Thank's!(I'm Romanian)
---
They could have been in a team with the other player.
---
someone made it not supercell
---
Ok ;)
---
*insert google translate here*
---
I got him a about 6k or 7k
---
But who made it that's my qweshten
---
Dawn I was about to write this
---
Band-Aid, Just past its OP times
---
I kill one or two people a match and rarely I don‚Äôt get the star token on the first try. Lol yes it‚Äôs a strategy to kill people but it‚Äôs a pretty bad one.
---
Fam I'm missing *Pam*
---
First deinstall BS, turn your phone off/on and reinstall BS. These steps fixed it for me
---
This is why it‚Äôs my least favorite event.
---
Ok like restart or just turn off
---
Ok why is that important
---
"Please don't let this get lost in new" I am pretty sure that's against the rules.
---
Rlly? I always thought Bull was useless in that event. Hmm maybe I should try it out.
---
This is NOT safe for work. That primo jump was cursed
---
Restarting works out too
---
Balls Of Fire
---
The legion of crows approves
---
Yeah boiiiii
---
From the animation Supercell released, we can see that El Brown is not a skin of Brown for El Primo, but in fact a skin of El Primo for Brown.
---
If a leon only plays lone star for the star token your missing out on a LOT of trophies
---
God dammit.
---
New meme template?
---
Recolor of regular skin, it should cost 500 star points. Cool design btw
---
Thats why i dont even bother playing takedown. Too annoying to take 90% of the match getting to the bot coz you got killed by a thrower / colt / really anything but gene
---
Let him die by the storm
---
Nobody cares.
---
Pro tip: don't waste gems on skins if you don't have all the brawlers
---
Someone posted the empty template,and i made a meme.
---
Most original post i think anyone has ever seen on this sub.
---
I think so as well, but than not how it looks now but this as idea and than make it brawl stars like and better. This could be a very funny and nice skin.
---
Has anyone else gotten the glitch where on the news tab it shows 1 notification for the videos portion? I have clicked and watched each video but still showing the number 1 on the tab notification area.
---
He is under your bed.

I have brawlers at 400 trophies, but I want to improve my skills with my newly acquired ones
---
Boxes
---
Thank god I though he was under my bed
---
Did you have a 999 trophies piper?
---
u/fnafxbrawlstars
---
I got it from a meme generator and it's called "man surrounded by slippers"
---
How is it possible to use 35 tickets? Isn't 20 the highest possible?
---
enemies: these are very confusing times.
---
You‚Äôre a moron. Kill stealing is pure luck. And I‚Äôm acutely aware of what rng is. If you think lone star takes skill, please stick to lone star so you don‚Äôt poison 3v3s with your ‚Äúskills‚Äù. Moron.
---

wait, this sub isn't r/shittybrawlstars? holy shit I didn't even see a difference
---
For me Tick is the cutest brawler and i'm serious so ignore my flair
---
Bandita shelly is a cool skin
---
Congrats I dont have shelly
---
Flair checks out
---
Congrats
---
Emz at home is better than regular Emz

TBH remove energy drinks and meteors. They do nothing to discourage teaming and just fuck up the game.
---
He did look in the corner down in the image
---
You refuse to bring up any new arguments, and have resorted to calling me a moron. Thats kinda cringe bro
---
r/ihavereddit
---
Yours wasn't really a risk. If the Rosa had gotten the energy drink you would have been dead for sure. You made the smart move.
---
Brawladays
---
Nice idea! Just some things I noticed: 
---
His super -  it's like a Darryl roll that can break through walls, AND you get to control him during the roll. Think this needs to be reworked to make less OP. Also, his star powers seem really OP too depending on the range of them.
---
*nuts?*

This is true, I usually spin to indicate that I'm friendly. Sometimes works but most of the time doesn't

Since the new update, the game is lagging so much no matter which phone or internet I'm using

Thanks so much, have to turn this into an inside joke with my friend
