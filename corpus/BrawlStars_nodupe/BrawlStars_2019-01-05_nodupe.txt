Even darryl makes fun of him
---
Idunno man, ask my team mates
---
I used to think he was bad until I realized I that you need to be specific on which maps to play him on. 
---
for rico should been: Same as Colt but his bullets will come to you no matter what.
---
Yeah i know thats my point the guy i replied to said it goes up
---
I need ricochet, the legendaries, and the mythics. Got all 3 epics. 
---
Cuz he killed darryl :)
---
Spicymike
---
Long range wins unless Shelly jumps him close up
---
You can check by going to the shop and tapping either of the boxes and tapping the i in the top left corner there it says all of your drop percentages
---
leon is a joke
---
Crow is great when you have a team that can clean up and take care of all the poisoned players trying to hide. Otherwise his damage and health is to shitty to do anything with. 
---
Bull doesent even have to leave the bush 
---
You need to play very carefully dont rush high damage/hp brawlers like bull, primo etc try to flank and take down brawlers like colt, crow, penny, jessie etc and most important dont miss your super try get as close as possible that they cant out range you
---
Damage +8%
---
Range +1 tile 
---
Invisibility +1 second
---
And there u go here are my changes to make Leon seem more balanced
---
Same 
---
This is a joke right
---
oke dokey
---
Bruh there are like 20 Leons there.
---
Mortis might be level 9
---
***\*ALL CREDIT TO***  u/thepengu77 ***\****
---
Maybe he's level 9?
---
He‚Äôs a plant
---
Im missing ricochet penny all epics all mythics and all legendaries
---
...Hello? I'd like to get some bushes on my property removed, how much will it cost?
---
I'm at 4.2k trophies.... with only rares and super rares :/
---
Is this just for a particular game mode? I‚Äôm looking for a brawler for Deathcap Cave
---
I like how mods keep this up but delete my ‚Äúlow-effort‚Äù posts in 5 minutes
---
He is like Mortis, get close to low health brawlers, kill them and run away. Avoid tanks. You can also apply pressure and do chip damage, then escaping.
---
Darryl is so much better than Bull and Shelly at high trophies, don't play him as if he were a shotgunner
---
There's nothing glitched. The last person to deal damage to the Rico was the dyna
---
Wow!
---
You can do it on mobile
---
I SHAKE MY *SHAKE MY HAND*

did it in 24 sec homie
---
False advertising 
---
Jojo*
---
Crow flair explains it all
---
If you need to select a star power, why is the box pointing to ‚ÄòSUPER‚Äô
---
He is level 10, you can tell by the star underneath him, like, in the green circle, you can see a star shape inside it. By that you can tell of a brawler is lvl 10
---
Everything looks fine to me...?
---
Looks like 7 to me crackhead
---
Well ppl have done it in like 13 sec lmao
---
üëåüëåGOTEMüëåüëå
---
Where does it say that pink one is female?
---
NEVER
---
Seems like a wonderful idea, but it won't happen since they would need a whole new team for the story 
---
Nope, you can see in the video that he's level 10
---
I don't get this at all why the f*** is there a dynamike head on a dinosaur
---
Seems fine
---
They are both male...
---
Glad you liked my Rage idea!
---
Can I ask a quick question? Didnt wanna make a new post just for it. Are tokens always rewarded in even numbers? Like 10, 20, 30 and so on?
---
I can‚Äôt believe this comment. You think a template meme is high effort? I think it‚Äôs absolutely ridiculous that one would think a TEMPLATE MEME is not low effort. If someone takes hours to make a meme off a template, that is 100000% on them. And it‚Äôs not just a moderator, I and many other people on this subreddit decide what is low effort through the report button.
---
Crow was one of the best brawlers in the game before, the only nerf was the amont of hits required to charge his super was increased. So why do you want a health buff if he was one of the best brawler with the same health?? If you want to buff him decrease the time he takes to charge his super. 
---
Skin to win bro
---
Leon isn‚Äôt been op...
---
The red bars in the meter are overlapping the black line, and that is not the case with the blue bars in the blue line for your team.
---
First being El Primo right?
---
El Peter couldn't make it today. I'm his counterpart El El Peter.
---
The joke is that it is the same background as the one used in the "you know I had to do it to 'em" meme. It was purposely made like that to make the meme less important (as El Peter explained).
---
I hope this answers your question.
---
El El Peter out!
---
dId YoU jUsT aSsUmE sPiKe‚ÄôS gEnDeR(s)???
---
I‚Äôll ~~carry~~ help you. How many total trophies u got
---
Bo definitely needs a buff because enemies can walk into a mine and quickly walk back so they don‚Äôt get hurt. A possible solution to this could be a trap instead of a mine that goes off instantly, but does less damage.
---
please change the immune mechanic in showdown mode. it can be really game changing sometimes and it is so stupid. you kill someone and then some bull gets revived and oneshots you while he is getting no damage for no reason.
---
You can queue up at the same time with a buddy and if your lucky you can get into the same match, kind of like solo teaming in Fortnite. 
---
Bit of both. Darryl underwent a huge rework so he now travels 7 tiles with his Super. What he was previously was a character that easily outgunned a Bull, rolled 23 tiles and his Star Power only lasted during his roll. But as you can already imagine, this made him absolutely OP in Heist and shit in everything else.
---
At the moment, his damage falls way short of the other close-ranged brawlers, and as a result, his Super is only useful as an objective-based mobility tool. 
---
The crow one is too close to home. 
---
The brawler i used with most success were bull and primo. In fact i think i literally got bull higher than 250 trophies just in one heist event alone.
---
Lobbers are another super strong type of brawler as you can dmg safe from good distance withiut depending on terrain destroyers. 
---
One thing that should be changed is brawlers should NOT be able to walk through the safe. 
---
Also, add a ‚Äòmelee shield‚Äô (melee type brawlers do 50% less dmg to safe) for the first 20% of safe health. This would promote more stategic play than just full agro rush.
---
It‚Äôs very f2p friendly in terms of maxing your brawlers. However you shouldn‚Äôt focus all power pts onto a single brawler (don‚Äôt ‚Äúmain‚Äù a brawler) as everything else would be under leveled. 
---
[removed]
---
Yeah true. Was just trying to give some quick examples off the top off my head
---
Yeah I said in the original post I bet we‚Äôll see this at the first major lull of the game.. super excited personally lol 
---
My thought was to max out one brawler per gamemode and then only push those brawlers up leaderboards. And then the rest can be underleveled and for fun not stressful pushing.
---
oof
---
Happened to me. I was mortis and i just teamed with him coz he cant do anything to me and killed him when he had 4 power. I dont know if that counts as teaming, we didnt kill anyone together 
---
Thank you too
---
don't talk like that with crow üò≠
---
*Scouting the bushes to see if anyone is there to charge his super and charge to the house* but then a miracle happened..........
---
A shelly with super came out and shot the bull... to his death
---
I totally agree with you on the fact that there are way too many one tricks in the game rn. I‚Äôm almost at 8k and I consistently get matched with 1-2k people. However, I don‚Äôt really think weighting total trophies will fix the problem because then it will be way harder to push all your brawlers equally. You are going to have a hard time pushing that 100 trophy brawler if the rest of your brawlers are at 500. Idk that‚Äôs just my 2 cents
---
Why are you trying to sound like customer support lmao
---
It depends on whether you focus on a brawler or not. When I had piper I decided to max and it was really fast. I started the game in June 2018 and I already have 2 maxed brawler, soon 3 and my 21 brawler I have more than 9 or I lack power points.
---
*mike.exe has booted up*
---
Yay my two favorite brawlers
---
Day 5: He's just been walking around my house all day and night, screaming about how "THE BULL IS GONNA STEAL YOUR VIRGINITY" and stupid stuff like that. Jokes on you, pal, I'm a robot so I don't have a... y'know. The screaming is pretty annoying, though.

If he was level 9 he wouldn't have the brawl stars logo below him :)
---
most of the time one guy would spin around in circles to try and team and if the other guy spins as well it means they have agreed to team. not speaking from teaming experience :/ just watched some youtube videos

How can i report you for excessive whining?

Cool thx

Same. Been waiting since before global launch

Quiet library kids? You sayin we're intellectuals?

Day 17 : brawlstars sees this convo and decides to add a campaign to the game and add this story
---
somehow poco takes 3 years to kill a box but 3 milliseconds to kill me
---
Yeah, I sure hope it comes
---
Seriously they should add a campaign
---
This will make the game a lot more complex, I like it
---
Tower defence simulator
---
This reminds me of r/whywereyoufilming (Maybe not the right name but something Like that) were you recording or just took a screanshot at the perfect moment
---
Thanks for this lol trying him now at power level 3 since I was so shocked he's supposedly good and just got annihilated twice, saved me further embarrassment 
---
Nah chief thats wrong
---
Scientists say this is the last image a brawler creates before death in showdown.    Kinda reminds me of baki the grappler gore

Thiccness level-1000

Maybe next time
---
22 is the amount of brawlers in game. So 100% = 22 ....
---
Even just Getting all 3 rewards is Awsome 
---
No, I have all the brawlers except for the 3 legendaries but still haven‚Äôt gotten the offer yet.
---
First though was ‚Äòawesome‚Äô 
---
But if they do this they‚Äôll need to make it obvious what super that player chose to a teammate or enemy. Otherwise it‚Äôs a little less about skill before they see you super the first time.
---
Lol working on drawing the next brawler
---
Supercell makes games at the total opposite of mmorpg. Good mechanics and gameplay, but on mobile, no story, no quest, only short games..
---
Creating a mmorpg would be like creating a whole new company. They would need a whole new staff to do such thing.
---
This is the stuff that mods leave up?
---
ITS ALLLL IN THE CARDS
---
#1 Showdown would better
---
Let me give an AWARD for you a No-bush Bull
---
Try playing her more
---
Yea!
---
Good luck at end game
---
That‚Äôs why you stay away from people... she‚Äôs a sniper
---
DAY 8: OH GOD HE'S IN THE HOUSE HE WAS HIDING IN A POTTED PLANT THE WHOLE TIME HELP I'M UNDER THE BED SOMEONE CALL THE COPS
---
So? Just because they are a certain rarity doesn‚Äôt mean anything. And look at the power levels smh.
---
I‚Äôd say rise, although for me I don‚Äôt have much else to do now haha. 
---
Last update was fantastic and opened the door to lots of new potential gameplay 
---
I guess he means the YouTubers who hopped onto the bandwagon when brawl stars went global and not the YouTubers who actually liked the game and invested time into it during its beta stages like lex, Kairos and Rey 
---
Darryl is too cute
---
Use him to poke at a safe distance. Alternatively,dont. He a bastard
---
How often do new gamemodes come out?
---
I've played brawl ball a few times and haven't seen it come back into rotation in a week.
---
Bo's actually good at something...
---
I‚Äôm guessing you‚Äôre referencing teaming
---
First time i saw bow top tier
---
You'll be waiting for a long time bud. 
---
How does star power play into this
---
That it will be of three rounds who kill the other one two times win and all brawlers can have the double of life like a shield yo make little bit dificult to win 
---
This Ricochet with only 2 powerups was following me constantly spinning. I was almost dead and was being harrassed by a crow and the Ricochet killed the crow but ended up dying. He saved my life and I ended up winning but I will never forget that brave warrior. F.
---
You mean battle log?
---
Love this ideaüòòüòò
---
Makes it more "strategical" and "versatile" 
---
Team compositions in lower trophies are mostly random. You see him a lot in gem grab higher up
---
Definitely!
---
Safe zone is definitely my favorite map, because it allows for a ton of different team comps rather than bull, a thrower, and a support. I also prefer quicker heist games, because long stalemates aren't fun for anyone.  Heist is easily my favorite mode regardless of the map though and I think it should appear much more than it does now.
---
Get colt!
---
I always found it kind of funny how whenever Rico loses, his arm straight up falls off. Anyone else find it funny?
---
Yeah when my angry level reaches to 1Ô∏è‚É£0Ô∏è‚É£0Ô∏è‚É£% when I see internet connection when I‚Äôm playing good 
---
Hey how are you 
---
Too scary, Bill flanking is already terrifying
---
Haha lol
---
It's a real pen
---
Hey man can u show us a gameplay of this skin i love brock and i have been having second thoughts on buying this skin lol
---
I understand that the XP packs keep coming back, but I don't need those lol I want the Leon special offer to appear in my shop xd
---
Run away in showdown
---
Coach Cory‚Äôs next video lol
---
Thanks
---
Rico is good
---
What is so special about this pic?
---
Day 9: While waiting for Colt to arrive, I set up a trap for Bull. When he walks in, a flaming barrel will hit him on the head, knocking him out, allowing me to shoot him with everything I have. All I have to do is stay in my room...
---
Check your profile
---
Yeah, it's so much fun to start out a match (especially heist) with a player that AFKs for the first 20-30 as seconds. Instant disadvantage
---
The most respectful ones both don‚Äôt have skins or voice lines ü§î
---
not even bad... titled my Darryl from 489 trophies to 267. Never recovered

Once she gets one good super tho, she can just keep chaining them.

tilted my tara from 517 to 451

Point of this post:
---
Most people think that legendary brawlers are the most op brawlers in the game and they would freak out if they ever get one so if Bull was a legendary everyone would freak out and be like ‚Äúholy shit this thing is so op‚Äù because he is so op in a bush

Supercell-

Hey everyone, ever thought of how this guy feels about you saying these stuff to him. It doesn't feel good what makes you think that saying these stuff to him makes him happy. You guys are the brats who insult people for no reason. Just because you didn't get a brawlers doesn't mean that when he gets a new brawlers you have to insult him like that
---
I‚Äôd say that all of the E tier brawlers are better than Darryl in pretty much every game mode :p
---
How is mortis different to crow?
---
BRO YOU FORGOT THE WATERMARK
---
Ah, ok that makes a lot more sense

Holy shit how many people are going to post this

Low tier-Cries, puts Ricochet and El Primo because they have their hands to their face. Meanwhile in the tier right above, Penny and bull are doing the same thing.

Bottom tier has 2/3 turning their back on you, meanwhile in mid tier Mort and Leon both looking away?

Pretty sure you know nothing about how a server works.

Don't facecheck.

They are just dancing to the BS theme, let them be

That person played with 2 other people with max accounts.

but until you go to rabk 4 on your any brawler you wont lose trohpies.get a new brawler and check out for yourself.

They match you with similar trophies. 
---
I found some nice guys who credit our work 
---
Wooosh
---
It‚Äôs a good idea, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs what supercell would do.
---
Firstly, SC priorities FAST mm over ACCURATE AND BALANCED mm. Waiting 20 seconds for a game is time that supercell doesn‚Äôt want.
---
Furthermore, there could be trolls just purposely switching to the brawler which your teammate would want to play and cause their teammate to be randomly assigned.
---
Agreed.I got 3min 39sec with her.Het chain shots are devastating.

Mortis it last dont 3.

I got her today I think she‚Äôs the coolest and so much fun to combo with frank or dyno!

I just noticed the link doesn't actually work so ima just post it here: https://youtu.be/2pXQoUvIY3M
---
Ok
---
I just started 3days ago, did you spent money for upgrading? Because upgrading a brawler seems like it will take months to max one considering how much gold they cost and how hard it is to get tokens to upgrade.
---
Why are you switching subjects as fast when I give an argument?
---
classic supercell
---
Same here
---
Oh wow ye you're right. Leon is good too üëåüèæ

That's called teaming, welcome to brawl stars.

Sounds good but flex seal walls can‚Äôt be destroyed buddy, it‚Äôs flex seal we‚Äôre talking about.

Weird, though I am not complaining!

Martiss

LMAO

What...
---
Yeah it is frustrating, everyone just team up and you are alone... I try team up and  get close and kill partner. It is my way to fight with teaming up :D I hope that person is so frustrated and stop teaming up or do the same thing as I did. Try it too! It is my guilty pleasure ;)

I think it is hard to catch. Devs will have to watch sometimes to arenas and can't work on another things.

Dooooo ittttitititit

Sans is Spike. 
---
Then it only proves that those parties in solo games will be a part of this game forever. So there is no point of playing solo anymore.
---
First time?
---
Nice one
---
It was the fifth game in a row with parties like this.
---
Kk
---
It doesn't change that salty players will report innocent players and waste supercell's time

Good idea but his face doesn‚Äôt really add up. One should look upset and the other should look happy.

As a f2p this felt incredible!

No problem!

I cant find the loss pose so i went with this
---
Pretty average to be quite honest. I don‚Äôt want to come off as mean but you would have to get a pretty insane score for it to be of any worth.
---
True, because her standard attack is so strong already but it essentially always jumps between three enemies. The turret is also a really nice distraction.
---
I've got a afk warning midway through the game, because I was just camping out in a bush for a whole lot of time lol

Brawl stars sucks

I feel ya bro.

Meeeeee tooooo

Oh don't worry you didn't come off as mean. But thanks though.

I'm still rather proud of myself

If you're reading this, I'm sorry fellow "???" Bull who was backstabbing a Piper a few hours ago but got killed by a Colt instead :'(

But Supercell officially approve teaming as a valid strategy.

soo mutch memories of being killed by teamers :)

/s??? She definitely isnt in need of a buff, if anything she actually needs to get nerfed
---
ahahahah
---
Okay then answer this question besides tanks not including Pam who can she beat and answer this as well while you‚Äôre at it what game mode has she been consistently good at gem grab besides stone fort nope and at it she is still very replaceable showdown with star power bo around a big nope heist kaboom canyon and... well that‚Äôs it bounty same as showdown brawl ball sneaky fields and triple dribble and maybe just maybe pinhole punt
---
Why does he become black and white 
---
Yes but whe just want to play drryl like the old days
---
Supercell likes teaming so they won't do anything. 
---
I dont know some people are just unlucky like my friend whos been playing since global drop as i have only has 11 or 12 i dont remember i on the other hand have 19 and am only missing the legendaries
---
and he is week
---
My first one was also Nita!
---
This is what i call HELL
---
It is #REALLY BAD I played like 8 matches and all lost them. 
---
Brawl stars took ages to be released lol
---
He should scream ‚Äúthat‚Äôs a lotta damage!‚Äù When he attack‚Äôs people
---
Oh u have negative karma now good for u
---
Excellent
---
Bull
---
No.
---
Colt: NOT THE FACE!
---
Office quote I love it
---
Yeh
---
Yes yes yes! u/brawlstars
---
Omg :)
---
Shitpost
---
Mortis would be good too, swinging in the bushes as a gem carrier and dodging Bull! Bo with Star Power would be by far the best in this map!
---
I was referring to the HP.
---
Thanks, Can you please vote me up?
---
There should be something like this, i keep finding people trolling like no tomorrow or staying afk in the spawn area...
---
I know but the speed could cover that 
---
The bane of my existence is an auto aiming colt... I just open up my ass and prepare to lose trophies
---
Jessie as big brawler
---
Colt/ Shotgun/ high damage output brawlers for everything else. His as much as you can when big brawler
---
Oooooohhh this looks awesome!!!
---
BULL IS RIPPED
---
Oof thats high
---
Then it's better on others
---
Mortis should be on the bottom tier, but the rockabilly should be on the mid tier
---
My favorite is the crybabies whining because they have 9 star tokens and 99 regular tokens like it is a conspiracy against them.
---
You took a shitty ad and made something so god awful I don‚Äôt want to look at it. Good job
---
Just Stop, Nita's bear is a billion times better than this despite it getting oblitered everytime. This chicken wil die to the weakest of weak brawlers.
---
Do not give up you have to take a rest then play again you can do it
---
U/TheCanadian1739
---
u/TheCanadian1739
---
Ayooo
---
it's super charges super fast like 3-4 shoots 
---
Brawl stars have 22 brawlers designed to dominate in different modes. But other games have lesser characters, each stronger than one and weaker than another.
---
Close range or long range shots?
---
Nice video. Now only if it weren‚Äôt Leon you made it with.
---
We have done it in 45s 1 hour ago, but im pretty sure you can go way lower to 30 seconds i think
---
long cuz the chicken flies 
---
A family that brawls together, (probably) stays together.
---
nagger
---
What game is first in your country???
---
How do the stars get determined?  Like how many you get per elimination? 
---
Not like it's original anyway
---
This seems like a good map dispite that is is from clash royal. 
---
Wow! I like it!
---
Idk but i never got a legendary offer and i own every brawler except legendarys
---
I got spike with the old descriptions but crow with the new ones and with crow I didn't even bother taking a screenshot
---
Did I say 15? Make it 16
---
Well because everyone is complaining about bad matchmaking I thought i would be nice to show that is can be nearly perfect too
---
Dayum, and I thought I did pretty well
---
Spike:Hi mom hi dad what is the launch of today? üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Nice one Pam's son
---
Ok stop with these useless tier lists
---
I like the idea, but I think Brawlers should stay at one super to keep them simple. Nice job though!
---
Huh, I have no idea then. From what I've seen using LTE is better for lag, irdk man
---
ah right okay,
---
figured it was another bad one lol
---
17 now
---
But then, suddenly, out of nowhere...
---
***EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEELLLLLLLLLL PRIMOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO***
---
I agree
---
9 brawlers are on 85 +- 2%. Thats not bad
---
Sorry I couldn't understand the note, please reframe
---
i was more so on about the colt,
---
r/OGbrawlstars
---
The only games more f2p friendly than BS are games like pubg mobile etc. He is delusional if he thinks this game is f2p
---
I dont like the whole life leach idea we already have crow maybe regeneration after he deals damage? 
---
I played the game since the android realese not global realese and not iPhone realese so i never saw it
---
Ecks dee so funny exks dee hahahaha Ecks see 
---
Jessie and Nita are really strong, bc their turret/bear get more health and dps
---
ay its a sfw version
---
No he didnt and very well so it was fine. ( Like there is any skill diverence from 0 till 250 )
---
You're breaking boxes incredibly inefficiently
---
We are just more woke as this sub has not been invaded by normies yet
---
Had about 19 tickets. Did three 2x tickets, one 3x and the rest just 1 ticket. Had 2 leftover and only was the big brawler once. Used bear boy and succeeded my first time as big brawler. 2 mins 28 sec.  Had 10 boxes to open and got more. Honestly, for the reward, it‚Äôs easier and less hard to play with the team. Same rewards and less more chance to win in my opinion. 
---
That's my point, he deals damage and heal at the last shot
---
Hahahahah so true 
---
Yep üôãüèº
---
I don‚Äôt understand how adding emotes and in-game text have anything to do with 5v5. About ‚Äúdumb toxic‚Äù or afking players, you should always play with friends or reliable people from the r/BS Discord server. SC will probably do something about players who are inactive on purpose.  
---
If you are the big brawler that has an ability to heal yourself it wil only heal you a quarter of what you would get healed in a normal match to prevent brawlers with healing abilities to be over powered as the big brawler
---
I would be happy to with crow. He is the last brawler i need for a year 
---
What is your point, there are so much childrten with an phone/ ipad here (percent) that those games are on top. Meanwhile, Brawl Stars is too hard for those.
---
The more you don‚Äôt get brawlers from boxes, the more the percentage increases of actually getting them in boxes
---
I once faced 5 teamers, mainly Pipers and Franks. I hid for as long as possible, but I lost in the end and also got -1 trophy. Ridiculous.
---
redesign mike &gt; give him a limited skin like a week after the game releases globally even know hes a 2000 trophie brawler and itd be impossibly hard to get him before the skin goes away &gt; give him another skin
---
Not a very vulnerable position, you had strong grounds
---
I'm glad, thank you!
---
Why dose my post have 600 upvotes
---
I think it won't work anymore next time it comes around
---
[deleted]
---
i know this guy
---
saw him in duo sd with chiken in a vid long before global
---
Diverse\*
---
If u got pam better use her since u don't heal
---
*Upvote dis post or you gunna have a bad time*
---
No, I changed a few colors
---
I think Nita as a mini Pekka could be improved but the generl concept is cool 
---
Gg lol
---
Yes I mean like what kind of game is it, not the name of the game literally...
---
1 Star Power Bo should suffice.
---
WHOM DO I WOOOOSH?!
---
Lmfao
---
Fair enough! 
---
Would love to hear your ideas on how it could best be implemented into the game!
---
Ya that will help max players who fear loosing trophies playing with their rank 20 brawlers.
---
Yeah... I just got Bo to 500, and now they announce that he is getting a voice. I would really want to experience it in a real battle (no bots) but I don't wan't to go under 500. I dropped Nita from 500 to 460 when I wanted to try her new skin.
---
That super would be really stupid 
---
Go to the frontpage of the sub reddit and below the "subscribe" and "create post" you will see your name and an "Add Flair" Choose your favorite brawler!
---
Looks like 1 quicktap
---
The more people who play the more people who will get lucky 
---
I get it. It's a Bull in a China Shop!
---
i dont know.kinda feels like shelly and mortis would look badass on a small bike
---
That's how mafia works
---
When SC first noticed teaming, they tried to prevent it but any additions were complicated, far-fetched or boring, and slowly realised that teaming is a valid strategy, as long as it isn‚Äôt organised teaming or mass teaming
---
And this was September 2017. Can people read other posts about teaming, see through the comments and learn that teaming is staying?
---
Good,you he a genius!
---
I have 3200 trophies and I only have tara and frank from the better brawlers
---
Exactly! Any ideas on how it could best be added to the game?
---
It's a thing that the devs are trying to balance. They want teaming not to be the only way to win the game but also keep it in the game. 
---
1 paragraph- Epic is a business, they need to make money. The whole argument that they don‚Äôt listen to the community is simply wrong. When did they not listen to the community?(No, double pump is a bug that had to be fixed)
---
2 paragraph- excuse me, it‚Äôs almost like epic never says that the game is going to be free . The actual game costs money now for 1 simple reason- its not ready to be free to play, as its very hard to understand, and everything will be flooded with dumb questions and trading. The whole money argument is simply wrong, you are not getting an advantage by buying skins. The save the world part of the game is buy it and play it forever. You don‚Äôt need to pay extra to get things. Save the world is actually getting a LOT better now, and i think when it goes free to play it will kill the br part of the game.
---
You need to play all brawlers equally if you want to actually progress in trophies.
---
What???!!! I have 5k trophies and i only have Piper and Mortis..
---
Mythic worth buying or better waiting for ledgy?
---
I would be happy if I even got a mythic...
---
We already have Barley
---
And I‚Äôm not ready for more stun mechanics
---
Hey there! I understand you are having questions about Brawl boxes!
---
The draws you are getting are completely normal. Here is a luck factor in the game so keep in mind that the higher rarity brawlers will be harder to pull. If you would like me to go in specific with these chances, feel free to let me know.
---
Best regards, brawl on! ü§†
---
I don‚Äôt team though
---
It‚Äôs a top-down arcade style shooter. It‚Äôs fast paced, short games. Mostly 3v3 but there‚Äôs a free for all game mode too. Different brawlers have different abilities and attacks. 
---
It‚Äôs not like clash of clans where you hit a wall and can‚Äôt continue, you can keep playing for as long or as little as you want
---
I hope u will get what‚Äôs make you happy buddy
---
Yeah ikr, it's stupid that we can't buy a skin for a brawler we don't own.. Don't know the thought process behind that. 
---
Hopefully will be a band feature soon..
---
Jeez dude, you‚Äôre stupid
---
It's 1v5, not 1v4
---
*Overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer*
---
You sound like the support team, but with actual useful information
---
\&gt;Get owned by a bull in a bush
---
Tbf to him this probably isn't the best place to ask. It's a team based action game. Download it and find out
---
Idk there are a lot of stupid kids on this sub-reddit and game...
---
Oh really? 
---
Well, maybe just one mode, because with 8 active modes, 4 with and 4 without trophies, the queues would be long. 
---
Showdown would be best imo.
---
Dude people suck in this game. I must be the best player on the planet because everyone I play with plays like they have no idea what to do.
---
Thank you! :)
---
SC algorithms 
---
You know that all game devs are goats? Right?
---
Dievherce*
---
Always pleased to find darkest dungeon references in random places of the internet
---
Not worth buying mythics imho
---
Mk. Thanks!
---
Thats pretty good though i mean you got a Mythic
---
Inb4 you also carry 10.
---
Honestly, Don't like this idea. Defeats the purpose of unlocking boxes.
---
maybe a valentine version?
---
Ya, as Supercell has removed practice mode , it can be a replacement for that mode except we will play with real people rather than bots,it will be a fantastic addition üëçüëç.
---
Nice!
---
The big brawler wins at 2:15 or something like that, not 2:00
---
Probably kids or people think they'll win and take such risky move. I rather bail with the 10 gems rather heading to a fight
---
Only the real 90's kids will remember 
---
Unfortunately I cant experience this due to maintenance lol
---
Maybe Frank is not that bad to hug.
---
Errr no..? So there‚Äôs a discounted item and a full price item, what‚Äôs the big deal..? What the dude commented is still valid, if he wanted to unlock both mythics he could
---
This seems like a good concept
---
yes make it happen!!!
---
everyone upvote it!!
---
This, I recently started playing with a premade team and it feels like I'm playing a different game, super easy to stomp people
---
With barley too (against mortis)
---
F
---
And you‚Äôre the Primo lol üòÇ 
---
Hmmm still you
---
Indeed, the easiest way is just to win games.
---
What a brilliant post
---
I mean don‚Äôt get me wrong he can still use a slight damage and health buff, but he‚Äôs still great. 
---
No tokens can be earned is better. So people should still play the ranked matches
---
Lel
---
Welcome to Showdown

900 is nothing? 
---
Enjoy the power points
---
wooow GJ ! amazing !
---
Bruh.... Gamemode? (Im assuming you started playing at around 0 trophies)
---
Can you try to send it to supercell? This skin is lit af!!!
---
I wasn't hoping for it, but I'm fairly glad someone posted this.
---
Un-BULL-ievable!
---
* naruto music plays *
---
Lmao so fake 
---
Likely going to be a different map next time boss fight is back though :(
---
Were you playing as the big brawler?
---
you lose 500 every second
---
That's good
---
Too much...
---
He‚Äôs getting nerfed. I got him to 500 in one day and then stopped using him. He‚Äôs too OP. My team mates got him to 650 and 700. 
---
No one likes bo lol shelly be like I want u just for your star power ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
What happened?
---
he is definitely getting nerfed so glad i got him to 500 first
---
Oh
---
His fat stumpy legs wouldnt even reach the pedals. C tier at least.
---
Especially to the losers who team up. 
---
Why is hugging a skeleton good sir
---
actually not really cuz of meteors
---
I'm changing my language to Italian right now! Ezperienza!! Sounds too cool
---
Don't blame me I'm kinda new 
---
I think mortis is underpowered
---
It‚Äôs a big fix
---
nothing 
---
It‚Äôs a bug fix...
---
i think his reload speed should be 6 seconds, i dont think he will be op
---
No
---
Lol I do that to get my 500 brawlers I take advantage of having global release friends 
---
thats how mafia works
---
Apparently you're the noob because when you try to team up with a Shelly and she accepts then you go over to her and then she shoots you
---
Make one for every brawler please.
---
THERE IS NO UPDATE
---
True üòÇ I jumped straight here one I realised about 10mins ago üòÇüòÇ
---
If you had 300 more key doublers couldve gotten a mega box outta this
---
Bug fix, lol 
---
Abandoned camp?
---
no update , just bug fix. ;0
---
Bug fix coming in
---
Ok I'm not using app I'm using the traditional browser so my badüòÇ
---
I think they should reduce the amount of hits needed to get his super
---
I wish they Buff Mortis but is only a fix 
---
Repost!
---
No, and it also doesn't affect experience. So if you bet 20 tickets and you get, lets say, 20 tokens per each ticket, your total tokens will be 400 but exp will be 20
---
Neeta
---
Yes never team with a Shelly
---
Don't know why but the "ur uncle" name really suits to the franküòÇ
---
His hat would be a helmet
---
but El Primo is so nice, i think he likes hugs too
---
You don't need to blame supercell for that. That's your problem. 
---
What's new i didn't see anything new
---
Piper should be at Great section too.
---
I feel like this could be good for people who want to play brawlers they've got to 500 but don't want to lose 500
---
This is balanced between wins and losses, if they change it the top players wouldn‚Äôt be the best but the ones who play the most.
---
its just bug fixes lol
---

---
Okk,i will
---
I need skin pls
---
cant u see he got 3 brawl boxes?
---
I don't know why, but i love star wars related memes!
---
How would you know? Does this mean you are a *gasps* TEAMER!? 
---
Yah hug Leon and he backstabs u in less than a sec
---
Please send this in to supercell, this is amazing!!
---
So Nita likes pancakes
---
I'd say the community management is better than most, if not best right now. They do make a lot of changes based on what the community says. However they do keep adding unbalanced items so....

6/10, Piper should be lower considering she's wearing a dress.
---
It‚Äôs a nice idea but it would increase matchmaking time pretty dramatically
---
Unpopular opinion: the office is dog shit
---
That's interesting! A lot is lost in translation so I appreciate the info!
---
Mhmm I would wish that Brawl Stars team/Supercell would take this to notice, and perhaps scramble this idea?.. 
---
I won first duo match after maintenance with a randomüëåüèº

–ù–µ—á–∏–≤–æ
---
Better luck next year 
---
You forgot the part where Bull kidnaps Piper
---
You got Leon as well. Nice Luck, pal! 
---
No, just fucking no
---
It could work, here take my upvote
---
A nice map layout in it self, a lot of wide open space(Sniper alert), perhaps more bushes?..
---
And yeah, bit too nazi xd
---
I like how it could act as a deterrent to stop players from playing dumb characters in certain modes (e.g. piper in brawl ball). 
---
One possible issue is that this would basically cause a specific meta in each game. Everyone would want the same brawlers (e.g. Leon) People would have to go specific brawlers in order to get into a match. 
---
Ayyh, thanks! 
---
(For Barley) Only from long range? What about dealing 80% to safe on your own with a concentrated ult?
---
When I premade with one friend he picks Bull and he just opens all walls with one ult, and I solo the safe...
---
Lmao I have stuff to post but reddit doesn‚Äôt let me post anything for some reason 
---
Check my profile... Already post some Brawlers ideas too
---
[https://www.reddit.com/user/Azakamaru](https://www.reddit.com/user/Azakamaru)
---
Beat me to it
---
?lol?
---
Nah, that's how it's always been. I'm surprised there weren't more Shelly's though.
---
alright I didn‚Äôt need to sleep tonight anyways 
---
You forgot the Ring of Death lmao
---
I mean, you still could play the normal solo gem grabs, without playing against the 'wish teams', would be pretty rigged for a team of 3 playing solo, and a team against them, whos playing the wish thing. 
---
Only lvl 13,
---
Ha get on my level you crook 
---
Local Level 1 crook shoots down a couple of boxes and became a Level 35 Boss (1961 colorized)
---
And yeah, would want to add in the text, that you couldnt wish for any dublicate Brawlers (not possible to wish for 2bulls in the same team) or even wish for a bull, after you are one. 
---
Lasted the same with Jessie. She's op as big, pretty bad as a little guy tho
---
I opened 150+ boxes and didn't even get a epic, mythoc, or legendary on robo rumble exploit which was a better deal. Lol
---
+ Not possible to play wished teams against not Wished teams (so bid increased percentage to win) 
---
Interesting
---
Don't mess with the bull!
---
What are capitals
---
BRING IT SUPERCELL!!!
---
Now this is epic. This is probably the best brawler idea i've seen in a while
---
Frank's super is super deadly.
---
I went ham with 20.
---
NO ONE BEATS, THE BULLLLLLLLL
---
"Matchmaking is based on the trophies of your brawler"
---
Kapppaaaaa kipppoooi
---
Nita squadd
---
Nobody is supposed to be spammed. When the game was portrait and without auto aim we aimed manually all the shots. Including bull
---
Sadly not a lot of ppl understand the joke, but its still pretty creative
---
Robo Rumble
---
He has a demoitized symbol
---
Well it‚Äôs kind of annoying to see this posts 20 times a day.
---
I never really considered how fast their matchmaking actually was until you mentioned it just now, some games load up super quick. Nothing beats that feeling for sure, but what im tryna get at is that if it doesn‚Äôt exist then why promote even playing field for your game at all? ‚ÄúMatchmaking based on trophies‚Äù as a statement in their game is a blatant lie 
---
Cheers for th replys.
---
 I'm a new player not very good. I've got spike though so I'm trying to level him up but struggling to get him over 200 tropies  (I play with random people) has anyone got any tips for spike? Best game modes etc 
---
Cheers 
---
Relatable
---
 [Rant] on Brock players*
---
Every time I have a Brock in my team, It is 90 % GG for the enemy team. So frustrating. If you can't aim just use Shelly,Bull and spam auto-aim like a 500 Trophies Noob. No offense but it is how it is ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
See it 21 times a day then, ring the sherif cause it‚Äôs a problem that needs fixing. 
---
Having 400+ trophies means you should start to expect being matched with top players
---
After the Darryl rework I think that Barley is the best.
---
LMAO üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Just upgrading, or play solo only. Its really annoying for your teammates
---
The good ol' Darryl.
---
i guess supercell takes into account the trophies of other players you have recently played with? not sure. i‚Äôm at 384 on primo and i play against as well as with 500 trophy players sometimes if we keep pressing play again so
---
The Pekka-Mini Pekka combo in both Clash Royale and Brawl Stars would be OP.

I had more than 2 minutes as a boss bull

Duped shovel

Showdown is for noobs
---
IS    JUST     A     MAINTEINANCE     BREAK
---
Nothings needs to happen every time they do one lol
---
Lol
---
You lost the bounty one, even though you had more trophies. I'm very disappointed in you.
---
Didn't know you made 7 tier lists
---
Man this is cool! Well made! 
---
That Star Power is weird... Bulls, Darryls and Primos supers do knock players back, so why would Roys super only do it when he is maxed?
---
At least Mortis doesn't have the mechanics of Bull
---
I fully understand that and that's why I think they need to rework Bull and/or the concept of bushes themselves. But while that's an instant loss for you, it isn't an instant win for the bull. They essentially need that to happen at least 5 times a match to win, and it just doesn't.
---
It happens some games, usually either bad wifi on your end or bad WiFi on their end. Stuff like this has happened to the best of us. oof
---
Spin 2 win
---
What do you mean?! Leon is in the second box, can‚Äôt you see him?! ;)
---
You're right, star power could be another
---
Lol prueba y ya esta esto no es fortnite
---
How did it go?
---
Dude, what trophies are you at? 500?
---
barley lowkey looks like an instagram baddie with that pose
---
Go to the r/brawlstars main page. Go to 3 dots in the corner. Click change user flair.
---
I think it's the other way around
---
Someone explain what P.E.K.K.A. means to us who don't know?

Looks like barely and dynamike's dream

Piper can get this hug anytime
---
Good: poco

Ummmmm ok....

Dafuc
---
it will decrease 
---
Bo is confirmed to get a new model and a voice
---
Legendary drops decrease when you pull/unlock Mythics. So Pam shouldn't apply.

This is why I drink

I found this image on the Russian social network VK in an anonymous profile that simply disappeared... If it is true? I do not know, let's wait to know

I need this.

15 caixas, 5 power points do Leon

I got 30 today with Jessie, I survived 3:50 if I remember correctly. Finished up with 1200 tokens

I thought of a mysterious savage with a football in his head, yellow ink to symbolize his mouth, and 3 colored feathers on his head
---
Leon is Chameleon 
---
Ok chief.

Any idea of how I can fix this?I'm on Android and Supercell aren't replying with their stupid automatic sparky thing that doesn't help

2v2 decimated Clash Royale because they made it give the same rewards as ladder with no real risk. They need to only make it useable for crown chests.
---
This guy was a teamer and well not many people like teaming
---
Random question but how do you get the brawler and picture next to your name?
---
I realised that people who got killed and are now hovering around their killer would get bored super quickly üòÖ
---
So i had a new idea: while in soul form you are just a little green ghost but you can still move at max speed (crow, leon, mortis speed) see the battle and an area around your killer. This area is their soul contract radius, if you stay inside this area you can linger in the mortal world, but leaving it results in permanent death. Also if an enemy kills more people and collects more souls, his focus on one separate ghost decreases, increasing his soul soul contract size. If your killer gets killed you will respawn at your ghost's location allowing you to have a bit of control of your respawn location. After reaching 5 kills without dying the soul contract reaches its maximum size ( like barley's super thrown at max range). How soul wells work, is that when a ghost touches the soul wells circle they disappear. The soul well's size is identical to the maximum range the soul contract can reach, so if someone stands into the middle of it, the brawlers' ghost he killed will have nowhere to run from exorcism... 
---
Piper should be on the top
---
You lost me there fella lol
---
Yeah maybe you are right! I would certainly play more if i could compete with my fiends! 
---
Pain train! xD
---
The incentive is trophies, a leaderboard to be on, playing with pros, or the more simple man thought, "having fun." They have ranked rewards as well. The only other incentive they have is being able to unlock heroes but that is intentionally RNG locked because that is how they are going to make their $150 or so profits from each individual...
---
No....
---
It can mean prime tho.
---
By the way who says darryl is weak? 
---
Yes ofcourse
---
I beat molt before, I have the screenshot of it 
---
It most certainly is true haha it‚Äôs super easy 
---
this guy instagrams
---
Shelly and Piper are kinda great too
---
Love it
---
Niceeee
---
Oh... I went way too in depth with that one lol
---
I can‚Äôt play bull im terrible at him, and I team with my friend in duos?
---
I remember that game! It sucks ass. Guy I was up against clearly had nothing left and was gonna lose but then stalls and my WiFi went out for no reason for like 1 second so I lost. That wasn't epic
---
Hmm, he probably meant that the best way to get tokens is taking barley and using him in the corner. You will get 2000 tokens in 15 mins
---
Nice man
---
Seems that you can't get the I love it music vibes
---
Bull is probably for Bull, because he's really fucking annoying.
---
Barley=Bob but smaller
---
I appreciate your honesty
---
It looks so good man !
---
#NOBODY BEATS THE BULL
---
Thanks for the nice reply i would Date you!
---
Have a nice day my friend
---
Love it!brawl stars need more skins like that!nit some shitty bumbox brooks,even if its not in western climates,its from other supercells games and it looks amazing!
---
Popular opinion: It‚Äôs not
---
Even tho this is a good idea it simply wont work... Matchmaking is based on the brawler's trophies you are playing with. You cant have matchmaking happen before brawler picking. 
---
If I'm honest I don't think they were looking for an opinion. Just getting other people to explain instead of researching, then getting snarky when the rely wasn't helpful
---
In top roght edge you have those...3 points click them,than user flare and you'll now what to do
---
Yyaaaaaaaa
---
Wow thx üòÅ
---
Have a nice day! 
---
F`
---
It‚Äôs remind time
---
U right, that's probably what it is
---
My first time was 3m31s, second was 3m51s.
---
Oof very nice, I like it
---
It‚Äôs random
---
This is not even close to the truth. Supercell doesn't want to remove teaming... 
---
No. Above avarage means that most of the players are under that point. For example if most of Bulls are 400, then above avarage will Be 400+. However New players really favor Bull, and think he‚Äôs good in sd and play him. As other New players use bull, too, which makes bull players feel that bull is good, becuz he can beat other bulls, but not Longer range brawlers. This will make bull meta brawler for Some time. However i belive that New players will realize AFTER Some time that Bull isn‚Äôt that good, and Bull will stop being meta in lower ranks.
---
This is sick! u/BrawlStars add this!!
---
hello there!
---
Because he's 300+ trophies on that brawler
---
This is clearly sarcasm so he is
---
I mean once you get to 350+ trophies most people are 8-10 power anyway so I don't feel like it really matter if you get matched vs a 500 or something higher. They have the same power level. I get what you're saying it's obviously a disadvantage I just don't think it's impossible is all. You would have to queue with a team you probably couldn't do it with randoms. But I think good teamwork, comp, and chemistry will trump power level ultimately most times. 
---
Haha bro I pulled Leon last night from a regular brawl box lol
---
None will give a fuck about your post, people will keep posting over and over again.
---
Teaming can never really be stopped without ruining the gameplay.
---
Everyone who wants supercell to fix this needs to remember that these are individual players, not bots or npcs (unless you afk) that you can force to hit a nearby player when you reach a certain radius.
---
I‚Äôd say the only way you can actually fix this is through the community itself as nobody wants to switch the game to auto aim only (that is an idea to prevent teaming by causing you to shoot at the nearest brawler but it also essentially takes away the skill and makes it harder for aim focused units)
---
I‚Äôve never had a legendary offer. I just hit 1000 trophies if that matters
---
The first text bubble reminds me of something I managed to do with Colt in Gem Grab.
---
Red team had 9 gems and all of them were on the enemy Jessie. My (random) teammates (iirc a Brock and a Dynamike) left the Jessie with low HP, and I killed her and stole all the gems and another one from the gem mine from the center. Then I ran to a bush (not on the enemy side) with Jessie behind. I got disconnected 1 sec before the countdown ends due to lag, but we won the match. I also got star player.
---
Or u just use dat exploit
---
Hello there! I understand you are having questions about progression.
---
To get things started, let‚Äôs start off by saying that experience level nor trophies give you any sort of competitive advantage. When you win a match, you‚Äôll earn 8 experience points then 10 more if you get star player. If it‚Äôs a draw, you get 6 and then 10 if again, you are star player. And when you lose, you‚Äôll earn 4 experience points. 
---
In low trophy games, you‚Äôll earn 6 trophies per win and barely lose any per match. However, when you rank up, it will become harder to earn those trophies. The maximum rank you can get is Rank 20 which is 500 trophies. You can still play after you reach 500 trophies however, it will count towards season rewards. When the season ends, all brawlers above 500 trophies will lose 50% of their trophies above 500.
---
Winning will give you keys to help unlock brawl boxes to give you amazing rewards like coins, Power points, brawlers and much more! You can also buy power points in the daily shop to help you level up brawlers. If you would like me to go more in specific about brawl boxes or brawler power levels, feel free to simply let me know!
---
You can check you stats in the league reward screen where you see your profile. It should be located all the way to the left.
---
I hope this helped answer your question. Brawl on! ü§†
---
i think el primo means something like ‚Äòprime‚Äô. el primo is in his prime form
---
pretty sure the meteor won
---
no
---
Yeha it was absolute bull
---
Same here but i got him in the work xdxd, i hope you get more power for leon to get him higher in power buddy! :) 
---
noty
---
Haha hope u do too bro haha, his power is only 2 rn and I pushed him 300 lol
---
Hello there, I understand you are having questions about special offers.
---
The team has made a statement about this:
---
Any XP level pack offer or legendary brawler offer you haven't purchased, it will show up in shop at some point! We try to keep our offers fresh and interesting for our players, so soon enough they will be there and you will be able to buy the one that fits you best.
---
Just keep in mind to check the shop form time to time!
---
I hope this helped answer your question. Happy Brawling! ü§†
---
Coool! I have to see if he is broken as every one in this reddit and in youtube are telling! But later, my leg hurts hell xd!
---
Frank confirmed that all the OG Brawlers will get a remodel, he also confirmed an update quite soon. 
---
Friendly games alone count like bot matches, since it is like that "practice mode" it used to be. I was also beta player and I think that those friendly games with no friends are bot matches that still give you tokens. I entered recently and counted like that I think... Correct me if I'm wrong
---
Take American football for example, if you're up in the last few minutes of the game you just hike the ball and take a knee to run out the clock. 
---
Accept it, it's teaming or get teamed, nothing can be done out life leech.
---
Hello there! I understand you are having questions about special offers!
---
There are currently no special legendary brawler offers available in the store at the moment. 
---
Any XP level pack offer or legendary brawler you haven't purchased, it will show up in shop at some point! We try to keep our offers fresh and interesting for our players, so soon enough they will be there and you will be able to buy the one that fits you best.
---
Nice!!! Which one?
---
We should be able to report people, teaming is for losers
---
Crow sucks tho. 
---
I‚Äôm fairly certain trophies don‚Äôt matter, I think it‚Äôs just completely random. Thing is, I haven‚Äôt heard of anyone getting one lately.
---
that is so true lol the brawlers who need it most never get it
---
Your health slowly chips away so you‚Äôre forced to fight others for power points as opposed to camping in a bush
---
Hm, i can't wait for the new rico and also bo.
---
How many trophies do you have?
---
just got past 2000 today
---
Sopa do macaco?
---
I see ur MIUI 10 :)
---
Well...still better than two solo showdowns...
---
Well, it's leon, i have been reading a lot in this reddit along with youtube about how broken is he, is he that broken and i should be excited for him or...they all are exaggerating alot??
---
I feel like mortis is the only brawler that can make opposite ends of multiple tier lists.
---
Mortis IS a bad boy
---
Good idea, but first we need to talk about why your level 7 Phoenix Crow is still at rank 10.
---
Only 5?
---
lol I also want leon and i am near 7k trophies (sorry for my bad english)
---
*kill 3 brawlers and end up 7th* hmmmmmm
---
but yes i agree
---
Star Power: Thats Hot
---
it will probably happen out of nowhere 
---
~~I think u just gave me an fanart idea~~
---
It's just the brawler model, nothing will change with the gameplay
---
Thousand lakes
---
Well if Prince was an Undertaker
