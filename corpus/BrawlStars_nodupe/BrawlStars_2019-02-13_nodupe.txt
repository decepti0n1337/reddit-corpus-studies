Can we get an F for the old menu music playing

---
That's cool man. Was it hard to get there, or did you just play a lot?
---
Just showing where thwy would spawn, they would not all be there :)
---
Actually if replays become available for everyone, they could just make a ‚ÄúReport Replay‚Äù button. Basically it sends the replay and reason of report to Supercell and they can review it.
---
With what purpose? The chance won't get higher right?
---

*hacking noises*

Exactly lol

Thanks for the warning. I assume the next is a ticket as well?
---
I guess he felt compelled.... cornered by three pam' s mustn' t feel good
---

---
Ah I see that now
---
But it really do be like that so no stopping
---
Between what?
---
No. Too much people would have the same brawlers. Anyways, CR has more cards than BS has brawlers. It‚Äôs good for now.
---
Tara to Shelly ‚Äúcome with me if you want to live* That‚Äôs the Bull1000 artificial  bush over human skeleton.
---
Well then. That's a load of bull.
---
Literally right after seeing this post I opened a brawl box and got 5 Mortis, 6 Colt, and only 14 coins 
---
Yes of course, very perceptive. If it happens again, fine will be 740 gems and one downvote.

With your comment I was just notified by Supercell that teaming has decreased to 0% across all showdown matches.
---
Wow, good one!
---
Mrs. Obama, I did it, I stopped teaming.
---
Thanks Captain !
---
Exactly!

This. This is what people don't understand. Teaming is by no means a no-skill strategy, instead, it's a strategy that focuses less on pure skill and more on psychology. Read your teammate(s)'s movements. If they keep trying to approach you, they're trying to kill you. Know who to and not to team with. Know when and where you can trust your teammates. Understand that your teammates care more about getting a higher place themselves than getting a higher placement as a team. There's so many intricacies of teaming that so many people are overlooking. It's not a no-skill strategy by any means. If anything, it may even be considered more skill in some circumstances.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Still, fuck big teams. I'm an advocate of teams of 2-3, but the 9 man thrower teams are ridiculous. I remember originally getting Dynamike to 500 in Skull Creek and Stormy as my first 500, and every game would go approximately like this: the first 4-5 throwers to go to mid would get into a team. The remaining throwers on the outsides would either group up and form their own little team, or just get picked off by the big team in the middle. Then, after everyone except the one team dies, it'll usually split into 2 more teams, usually split Dynamikes vs Barleys, but sometimes it's just whoever is where at that point. Though it seemed like there were two distinct teams, there was 0 loyalty whatsoever. If a single Mortis showed up in front of a team of 5 Dynamikes, they would all try to kill each other or escape by any means necessary. It was still a lot of strategy, but much less fair of one. Especially since Mortis was so unviable back then, what with its movement speed being the same as the shooters.

That‚Äôs some justice for using OP brawler

Yeah, that's why I it should be able to be turned off. Rip.  :P

Not at all, you can still use it for new character unlocks

I got leon from one yesterday!

Oh he's there

Thank you OwO121212121221q, now I am free to roam this earth.
---
I won so many games due to having his star power... split second was a great map for him
---
Except he actually is keep looking
---
That Bull was so dumb... All he needed was one regular attack and that was all.
---
But of course, for a Pro like him, he needed to finish with his Super...
---
Just upvote the post and downvote his comment
---
That doesn‚Äôt make sense

I want you to know that I appreciate the civil discourse... especially with how.... venomous.... I was being in the beginning. I know how hard it can be to maintain your composure in a conversation, when you sincerely disagree with your interlocutor. 
---
Unfortunately people with great intelligence also have the easiest time justifying their beliefs (there's real peer reviewed research that supportsthis), even when they're wrong. I've tried not to succumb to that trap (and still do not think I have lol). But if you had been as, aggressive, as I was... I suspect the conversation would not have been nearly this productive lol.
---
I think that we could probably come up with some viable solutions to many of the issues that, unfortunately, plague this game. 
---
Not that I'm saying I don't love the game. I do. I very much do. And that should be apparent in my passion for improving its quality. If I didn't love this game, I wouldn't be here. It would be deleted or left stagnant and unused (I'm looking at you Clash Royale üò°).

That is not even special

Just wait till he ults on the enemy team with all 10 gems. *laughs in tears*
---
The petitions in this subreddit are based off of little kid‚Äôs ideas and dreams. The majority don‚Äôt even benefit the game they‚Äôre just useless ideas about skins and decals
---
Since I made the last post about everyone going Shakespeare under a Colt fanart every time I see comments like these they feels underwhelming
---
I had higher chances than that and opened about 7 mega boxes and got nothing...
---
None of them. Gonna open up my 200 boxes when gene drops and hope to get some lucky star powers.

As a global player this makes me feel like scum for missing the beta

Hi, I'm sorry for bothering you, but I started playing since December, I have a question, are star power "consumed"? or since you get it, can you use it indiscriminately?
---
Well maxing out a CR account was like more then 20k dollars. In Brawl you can do it for wayyyyy less
---
I always thought he threw raw steaks 
---
teaming in gem grab is even better

that spike and tara spent over 2 minutes shooting at each other and neither one of them got a kill lol

Yea ik that. He's countered a bit atm. Teamers always go for you. Darryl is very op atm. Crows are also very annoying. As well as each round had at least 3 leons including me. Pam is also hard to deal with. It wasn't the hardest it could have been, but it certainly wasn't easy being so squishy.

This is new for me, I don't know about this xp limit before you post.

One question, you played how many matches to show this?
---
Haha no worries. Thx for the compliment.

You always have your star power active once you unlock it. Hope that helps :)

At 0:02 you lost in big game

(Very Awful Quality)

reduces their score by 1, then when you upvote, it removes the downvote, which increases score by 1, and then adds the upvote, increasing score by 1 more. basically its the same as just regularly upvoting in the end but technically the upvote "adds 2"
---
I‚Äôm just saying it can be better.... I‚Äôm sure some people are losing their passion to get on the game on a daily basis. 
---
Ok man... but.. that whatsapp message at the end is pure art.
---
No trophies lost or gained so I dont really count that lol
---
I‚Äôve been playing for over a year now and it‚Äôs just one game that never gets boring!

Yep. He bought all the characters and power points. Totally normal 
---
I have no clue what you are trying to say here.
---
This would be good on April fool's day.
---
I‚Äôm not sure but I think it is around 1k+ xp
---
This can go either two ways. One, he very op. Two, he makes brawlers look not op.
---
Maybe so sort of long shock wave that when enemies are in the middle it does most damage and closer is middle damage and furthest is the least amount, and she would be at the speed of a colt or crow
---
 Oh snap üî•
---
Reminds me of the Overwatch ultimate symbols

Honestly when utilizing boxes a poco can hit the bull through it so easy win for poco

Big brain

How do you beat that?

Most likely to fail but ima give it a shot

Oh

But is it normal for him to have less than 300 trophies on all of them?

Really? Humor is not allowed?

I‚Äôll share the results but I don‚Äôt have brawlers over 400 for a replay

Can be defeated by a reverse card, which reverses every attack to her

Actually, I'm pretty sure he just glitches through the wall. Sorry if this sounds rude, not my intention.

Yayyyyyyyyyyy!

Not get another legendary for months bud

That‚Äôs true with any random full game lol. Unless you somehow get paired with a GOD. But that‚Äôs rare.

I'm fine with just one for now lol. My friends have been playing for months and don't have any.

Lol didnt think of that

You do realize he is still a legendary?

So just a few things in your post that are factually incorrect; el primo‚Äôs move speed is faster than spike‚Äôs. He‚Äôs a tank and tanks have the second highest move speed behind Mortis, crow, and Leon.

Wtf did you bring upon this cursed land
---
Lol I got my first epic at 5k+
---
Thursday time
---
But there are Crows climbing consistently to 700 trophies every season? Leon isn't a poke brawler btw
---
Is it just me or has this sub been pumping out really good memes as of late
---
That‚Äôs close enough for leon to kill pretty much any brawler in the game while just spamming auto aim 
---
that's not how does it work 
---

You have excellent taste

No, it's a Penny

Quality

Can you show the attack and super in game?
---
Why must is be 150 gems
---
it shoots with white cloud and super is pink hearts
---
yep~~I use rico in any where
---
As a poco main, i find the price outrageous.
---
Wishing I could afford that skin lol 
---
leon gang, come here

Wish I could afford lol

Tickets for try hards. (Robo rumble)

Token doubler for casual players.

Yes me too mythic brawler gang?

My friends are bullying me saying that i suck at the game, they often come in groups and tease me about how shit my channel is, that my channel is dead the minute it was created... 
---
Had that happen so often, jesus. I guess it makes a little more sense given that it normally happens when a team gets too stronk, but seriously. &gt;.&lt;

Not even maxed smh

Really?

Mortis:[Walks in]

Mortis: Hey uh, just checking if you guys had any spare power cu- OH MY GO

Can they extend the sale by one day so I can open my boxes for the gems after genie is released??

it‚Äôs normally 3D hearts in regular battles
---
I like itüòÜ
---
where did you get this? 
---
‚ÄòUsually‚Äô low skill, so it doesn‚Äôt apply to everyone. Plus, not many Mortis players are good, you still see many at 400 trophies trying to be Gem Carrier and failing miserably
---
Read this comment in Mortis's accent.
---
Double trouble.
---
I once changed the app's language to French in the hopes that I would hear them speak in a different language. Too bad they don't. That would be interesting to hear.
---
They should bring lore back. It makes the experience more attractive.
---
Weird...
---
My gosh, is this day 1?
---
I love bb, I pushed Jessie to 468 with it
---
With friends btw ;)
---
Spike is actually smiling so...
---
It's pretty cool!
---
Supercell keeps increasing prices... Make it 50-80 gems at least.
---
It‚Äôs a remake on the pikachu meme so...
---
Play him in GemGrab
---
I am having the same issue - i made a note of my percent chances for each rarity when I got that drop chance spread sheet a YouTuber posted, since then I have opened around 50 little boxes, 2 big boxes and 2 mega boxes and the percent chance for any rarity has not changed at all. I do have every brawler but Crow (and Gene but obviously he doesn't count) , however it clearly states your chances will increase if you don't get a new brawler, so either theirs a glitch, or they're outright lying and your chance stop going up once you get a certain number of brawlers.
---
Aw man. I would trade for spike :-)
---
6 big boxes and 48 small i think..started saving late tbh
---
i don't understand why mm doesn't takes power level into consideration  
---
imo there is a huge difference between a level 9 and a level 10 brawler
---
Yes, but Pikachu isn‚Äôt smiling in that meme
---
Poor birdie :(
---
Pumpkin Spike Latte
---
Photoshop?
---
Let's ask him in twitter to carry a hammer from nextime onwards in brawl talks.
---
Thanks! :D
---
Same
---
He is actually a thrower?
---
I mean the ‚Äúsmile‚Äù looks very similar to the pikachu face
---
Tara and Pam on auto-aim spammers,thats basically wrong. Put there Darryl.
---
Most and cheapest are both superlative form so you can't use them together 
---
Yea i now saw it xddd
---
Replays are saved when a brawler inside the game have 400 or more trophies
---
  
---
You don't have 400 trophies, but Nita do
---
What??? Don't fool me. You didn't draw anything
---
Zero boxes 
---
he should have 42000 attack, but he only uses 0,01% of his power
---
#n  i  c  e
---
So Mortis is in the Credic Card category but not Tara? 
---
I see the sneaky 420's you put on his stats.
---
Crow
---
Literally watching FRIENDS rn
---
lmao
---
Brock with his magician red was the first to die 
---
eventually
---
im not trying to brag but i got very luck and have 1 legendary 2 mytice and 2 epic at 2500 tropies its just pure luck
---
dune drift but with no walls and it's on gem grab :v
---
Damn, it really do be like that
---
im going to be harsh and nobody can stop me
---
Bloody teamers!

What‚Äôs a key doubler, what‚Äôs a key, and how does one get them? New playa

Fun fact: sakura spike is still name pink spike in arabic

Perfect Revenge... Victory + Star Player

make this happen on 1st April
---
You are but a minority
---
Why is this true?
---
Poco isn‚Äôt garbage
---
Spike is good, takes some skill and it's really satisfying when you hit 3 or more spikes with one shot.
---
He's not as OP as before, but still is balanced in my opinion
---
Not another bush lover map!
---
Oh hell yeah
---
Hell yeah!!!
---
He's in the weeaboo category. Because all Mortis players are disgruntled Yasuo mains that wish their shovel was a katana
---
Thanks 
---
Angry Tara/Pam main detected 
---
Keep spamming xd
---
It's best better to not use because we can't couldn't won't understand what OP try tried was trying will try to say
---
Nope main colt xd, i mean is difficult play with auto aim tara and pam, there's a chance to miss all shoot.
---
Weird flex but ok
---
Your team had a higher trophy count and that is pretty equal as spikes star power isn't that effective 
---
Triyng to annyo me thsi wouldknot wokr I am way aboev tath
---
It was the same reaction at brawlidays from me, I bought it straight away but then chef dynamike got out, and I'm never using this skin.
---
To be honest the only REAL tier is the Unga Bunga tier.
---
Everything else is just bait
---
I have 6 big, 52 small and one mega for the 4000
---
MAGIC!
---
Yeah ;) that's absolutely true
---
it doesnt really work because he is happy and not suprised
---
Weeaboo category moreso
---
Tara just spams :^)
---
Ik would probably be a pretty childish voice
---
At first sight,    I thought it is Ryan
---
I really like the layout, it looks nice.
---
On the other hand the story sounds a bit silly tbh...
---
So Mortis' last name is "Mortis"? What? And what did the old woman mean when she said "He looked like death" to "me"? Who is this "me"?
---
I dunno maybe I'm nitpicking too much...
---
Gravedigger clutches all dynamikes

Please dont summon the weebs. They'll stink up the thread

You got the right idea. Gj mate 
---
Can we have some Free Skins ? Please #JusticeForF2P
---
That feeling does not go away at lvl 9, so, means i need the star power?
---
This isn't his ..
---
Make a post in hope that the devs will see this, however with the last kill wins their has to be a time limit 
---
Give credit where credit is due
---
Ok thank for telling
---
I spent more on Poco's new cover, than I ever have on a Valentine's lover.
---
Poor bird ;_;
---
And?
---
You should thank KairosTime, I learned this from him.
---
He would be the most balanced brawler :)
---
OMG, how did I not notice? Bo Remodel please.

Thats....perfect

I played with a couple of good randoms yesterday on brawl ball and pushed 80 trophies, it was fun.

No i'm not, a member from my band got it for free

Yeah it‚Äôs a bug i guess. Got it for free too
---
Yeah same here, but it's true
---
Trophy Road Reward. You dont have to open it instantly.
---
Replays are actually enabled at rank 17, at 380 trophies.
---
XD ah Boy Fotoshop you got me
---
Woow hahahha 
---
I have played for a years bit still have no legendary. Dont even have all epics! But i have both mythics and 6.5k trophies

It's not photoshop!

Other 2 are in the bushes

1. Persons without Gravedigger user falir aren't allowed here hehe

Lmao this happens all the time to me

You‚Äôre not alone. I couldn‚Äôt care less.

Ok thanks!

But you can defeat them with mortis...
---
HAVE MUCH FEAR MORTIS IS HERE

Please say Its Photoshop this is a Kind of unfair dir everyone who don't get the skin for free

How much is he?

C√°llate boca mejor maric√≥n little puto, and all of you culo!"
---
Underrated pun
---
Yes the Colt Gang
---
Good idea. Also they could perhaps check the replays too. But since Supercel is a small team I think that they would be overwhelmed
---
The prices are ridiculous in this game.
---
Better that the Suprise Pikachu Meme
---
Lmao someone downvoted you
---
But yeah I noticed some people who got him as soon as he dropped had the cloud animation and others had the hearts. The hearts are probably an updated version because when the data miners leaked the skin it was the cloud animation. Guessing it's just a temporary bug 
---
XD
---
Was that you in the clip, That was amazing though!!!!!!
---
Yeah!
---
If you‚Äôre going to steal pictures, at least hide your other drawings

Kurwa xD
---
#THEY ARE'NT FIGTED SPINNERS!

And even then that ones only 150. Phoenix Crow is the only 300 Gem skin.
---
Nice. 
---
No one wants to team with Leon at all, I made it a challenge for myself to play as many games as it took to see if someone would team with me and it took 15 lmao
---
Its a complete remodel of the skin and an animation change, seriously be grateful

Ohhhh, thanks.. I understood now. üòÇ

Yep

Hmm.. something seems suspicious. You don't seem like a creature of the night.
---
This is so Lovely! Bull x Penny is one of my favorite ships!&lt;3 Nice drawing!!{\*‚âß‚àÄ‚â¶}

Buy it and max out Penny 
---
I am a hardcore Mortis main, idk how to get the flair.
---
 *~~Have much fear, Mortis is here!~~*  *Creatures of the night!*
---
That's a perk of this. I've realized there's so many GG maps with a lot of walls. I wanted to cut back on walls and make it a cutthroat game with not as much camping
---
You should be able to rank up all brawlers even more, you should have a good win to loss ratio. 1500 trophies?!? Bro I‚Äôm at 6.4k and I have 15/22 brawlers so I don‚Äôt know what your taking about
---
I am not like the second, and I am glad!
---
The MORTIS gang
---
Yeah I thought that supercell would release them eventually and no one had access right now
---
r/engrish 
---
I'm down

When they changed the match making I‚Äôve seen tons of people stop growing in trophies also it‚Äôs based on luck you your brother is luckier than you

Aaaw... I want he does this pose in victory with this skin. Latin lover eyes included XD
---
Probably not, Leon can outrange Frank, and with 10 power cubes that‚Äôs double damage. 
---
Dead meme
---
All my showdown games have a bull that does this
---
u/iDufflebag
---
Ok, scenario, bugged matchmaking makes 6 colts play together.
---
So a ton of golden bullets go flying everywhere and all you got to distinguish them is a faint glow around said bullets. If you didn‚Äôt happen to see who was shooting how the heck would you know in a high stress location who‚Äôs are who‚Äôs. you ain‚Äôt thinking that well because your trying to think how the heck am I getting out of this.
---

---
THIS IS AMAZINGGGGGGGG HOLY CRAP
---
Yo Happy Cake Day
---
No
---
Yeah I guess I did get a little triggered there but it's pretty annoying when people just assume autoaim
---
Yes
---
Why not? 
---
It simbolises valentines and music 
---
1h and 90 more :P
---
on it, chief.
---
we‚Äôll get there soon haha
---
A. Invisibility is not OP
---
B. He can only kill a Bull in showdown with several power cubes
---
C. If you can't counter Leon you're bad at the game.
---
i was joking there, no offense, i don't even care if you otoaim or not lol, i prefer colt too, theres not enough maps to take advatange of his bounces to make for from colt's damage
---
THATS PRETTY COOL
---
I don‚Äôt think I would go into a battle full of colts I usually go with a premade team anyways it doesn‚Äôt need to be completely golden it can still have the faint blue or red from what team it‚Äôs coming from
---
If you‚Äôre using el primo and you‚Äôre carrying 10 gems, don‚Äòt use your super to jump on enemies
---
We should all love people like him, keeps the game free for all the free to play players who continually chastise gemmers on this subreddit. 
---
Once you play this game for a few months you‚Äôll realize that he is the only character that you can dodge 100% of the time. Even without fast character like crow 
---
Yes he needs he is not an assassin that his class suggests. He doens't do high damage and has very little HP. If he would do that little damage he should have way more HP. Take spoke for example... he has same HP as crow but does a lot more of damage and his super has CC (slow) in area. If crow has same HP as spike he should do same damage as him as well.. I am not saying he need to have more burst but more poison damge I guess..... if we take Leon as example ... Leon has mora HP more Damage... same speed..... and even more range... I know Leon do little damage in max range... but so do crow 
---
Good point, but the odds of getting dominated are pretty slim if you‚Äôre a good player and your teammates aren‚Äôt bots 
---
Yeah I guess my original comment was misleading I think Rico is a good brawler I just prefer Colt and a bunch of people in my club were raving about Rico and slamming Colt 
---
Not really
---
Yes please!!!
---
Not rigged, you just most likely have mythics  WHICH LOWERS YOUR LEGENDARY CHACE 
---
If you're using bull, hide in bush.
---
EpicüòÇüòÇ
---
Its usually because he's already dead. 
---
Hey BIRDIE BIRDIE BIRDIE
---
‚ÄúThanks for the free trophies!‚Äù
---
I think the best I've had from one box was like 12 gems, but other than that I get 1 - 3 every 10 or so boxes.
---
That‚Äôs not what that sub is about tho
---
Remodel please 
---
gem grab is dog shit with randoms 
---
honestly playing crow in showdown is a mistake
---
You are telling me you haven't looked in a mirror your entire life? /s
---
Jokes aside that's a 200 IQ play right there
---
Huh. Well whenever there is a Rico in Showdown I always see him, he‚Äôs so big.
---
It‚Äôs like how they did poco‚Äôs new skin he has a different look but you can still see witch team it‚Äôs coming from 
---
I'll take it. 
---

Not my proudest fap.

How do you know? He is a mythic so he shouldn‚Äôt be

Except a recording isn‚Äôt saved for those games. ;-(

‚ÄúCOMEDY‚Äù
---
Mmm okay then.
---
Under 1800 trophies and just got Leon from a small chest, can confirm
---
Wow that was fast, I posted this like 3 seconds ago
---
Not having in game friends can be a problem. A good place to find friends is the discord for this subreddit, where there is a whole channel full of friend invites
---
Darrayl and mortis
---
I mean, he was 550 trophies. He wasn‚Äôt terrible
---
Wow dude that‚Äôs awesome. I‚Äôve been trying to balance all my brawlers around 325 and it‚Äôs been pretty annoying to have almost 6000 trophies and no replays. They should have made replays only for 5000+ trophies.
---
Bro I‚Äôve seen games with scores like 60 - 0
---
r/English
---
Holy shit
---
The el primo is my friend hahaa
---
What a coincidence 
---
It‚Äôs called browsing new
---
100 crow trophies or total?  I'm almost at Bo.
---
He can kite, chase, and poke. Yet he really isn't something that can pressure or take a hit. Does his dot stack up or not? It would be nice if it did.  
---
Outstanding move!
---
Very cool! The green pencil makes the shading amazing!
---
How can i get that brawler icon in my name? 
---
You must not play any solo showdown then...

So truee!!

Your post has been removed, make sure to use the body of a post to elaborate on the title.

Thanks bro, gonna win next ESL Tournament with Barley only
---
Yes definitely bots

You were very patient and calm. I'd be freaking out and getting killed right away! 
---
8-2 and still almost got u :P 
---
Thank you so much üíï
---
I can confirm as a day one (beta) player. Most of the trophy road brawlers were commons prior to trophy road being added, and drops are random.
---
And then you realise why you have to be at 400 cups because it is so laggy.
---
r/clashroyale r/lostredditors
---
honestly underrated 100000 iq post
---
what does it do since its a 150 gem skin or is it like royal agent colt
---
So cool üíï
---
They always do that..
---
Surely he bought it when It cost 30 gems
---
Nice edit
---
Its not fog its poison
---
Does it come with gf?
---
I have no Idea. Total noob plays from opponents.
---
They are guided by the spirits
---
there is someone who was alone or there was 11 players?
---
S T E C C A
---
It took me about 3500 to get epics and 6000s to get legendary i got all the brawlers and about to max out ~8000
---
fogg don‚Äôt care
---
Poisonous fog
---
Give it 3 shots just to be safe
---
Omg
---
thx man!
---
Poison doesn‚Äôt stack. His poison has 4 ticks and even at max lvl it does less than 400 total.
---
If I have one brawler with 400+ trophies, will the replay be available only when I showdown with them? 
---
No problem!
---
Omg but there are pipers climbing to 700 trophies therefore piper is op
---
Those are the randoms I get on my team
---
Why Colt wants to kill Poco?

Shout-out to r/Brawlstarscompetitive and their discord server.

This people who play after global release will never understood the fun of playing portrait brawlstars and a new brawler was a duplicate brawler...

PLEASE SUPERCELL MAKE IT HAPPEN! It's so annoying when you're teamed with, basically, bot wannabes
---
They don't do ANYTHING, it's like 3√ó2 in most modes, which is very frustating 
---
Yeah, I gotta say that QOL improvements make the game much more enjoyable. Maybe just reduce the size a bit.
---
For some reason, it does that if Poco is maxed. It's a bug I guess.

*DO NOT FEAR, MORTIS IS HERE*

Dude solo showdown is the best mode regardless of brawler

he is sl strong he punches ths arrow
---
agreed
---
~~i will eventually regret this but barley for the win hands down~~
---
As a Leon main, ik that Leon‚Äôs will most likely team with other Leon‚Äôs or team with other brawlers to take down a Leon. Leons will backstab if they‚Äôre teaming with another Leon

Wow, imagine delivering a bull or a shelly

**YAAAAAAH**

No its 10000000000IQ

i couldnt do that lol thats my favorite brawler :)

Yeah and probably will be 279 gems

Alaska doesnt offer jobs easily :(
---
lmao i hate you :D
---
There is situations when you need to aim by close range brawlers we know that, but when you aim with a close range brawler and the enemy too close you look like a dump .. there is no habit there is smart use.
---
It‚Äòs a strange map, I actually got star player since I got 2 of my teams 3 kills

Well done!
---
That‚Äôs the joke
---
No autoaim is dumb and should never have been part of the game. Aiming at close range is an important game mechanic and autoaim ruins it
---
Ya

Petition to ban petitions

Because they translated the word.

I love it when this happens, Leon is way to overconfident, even if he has 10 boxes
---
Poor barley.

*Wooo* It's your **1st Cakeday** yuyuty1! ^(hug)
---
darryl is good ngl
---
Mess with the noot noot, you get the shoot shoot
---
I have already see people complaing about Darryl. That he is broken right now...... Bo starpower was nerfed it is not that strong anymore he is not a Starpower dependent to be good anymore. His dmg buff it was really good maybe he need a rework to his attack somehow because he is some steps behind other gem grabbers yet. However he is a lot better right now without starpower.

Does anyone else hate poco‚Äôs voice

Your petitions are called suggestions

Ghost Leader is #3 Frank atm
---
1. Yes
---
2. Not really but it‚Äôs most likely that you will unlock them by rarity order because of the % of pulling them in a box
---
The answer to the first question is yes! I pulled Leon about 2 weeks ago from a regular box.  Not sure about the second one. I‚Äôm sure someone, somewhere has run the numbers though! 
---
\*Outstanding move meme\*
---
If he‚Äôs clever enough to do that he wouldn‚Äôt have ran into the gas..

But one person must be shelly, or am I wrong?

---
im doing this too but i have almost 100 regular boxes and 20 big boxes.and 1 mega box from trophy road
---
Please just give mortis a new voice! And maybe brock, they sound like clowns when they should be dark and swaggy, get brock his serious face again and a deeper voice like bo‚Äôs
---

Oh, that‚Äôs how it works?

---
Must be **shelly**? Nah you could be any brawler. Search up Duo showdown Glitch video by coach cory he has did a video on how to do the glitch.
---
Ow my ears
---
Man I wish it was 300+
---
Thank you for the quick response, was thinking that higher rarity brawlers can only be gotten from higher boxes but good to know, hopefully i get something good along the way! Thanks a lot!
---
I didn't know that. Thanks for the info
---
God damnit
---
I mean my comment, but when people say "petition" they just mean something like "who else agrees such as such"
---
It's a game, and he's having fun. If it honestly triggers anyone, then they shouldn't play.
---
Bear being clever at the end üòé
---
You got me chief
---
Brock is alpha backstabber 
---
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying.  I know matchmaking doesn‚Äôt take into account power levels, however it‚Äôs trophies. Usually people are 400 are good with those respectable characters. So by them having two of their main guys at power 10 to my teams zero.. unbalanced is all I‚Äôm saying. 
---
Granted some people still suck at power 10. Not in these two games I posted. Wrecked my randoms
---
Boo.
---
Awesome dude mortis gang I hope this get into brawl stars well done 
---
Take my upvote
---
Um put a white background plzplz
---
When instead of the pikachu meme you use a spike pic:
---
I picked this game up about a month ago and loved him a lot (1st one I hit 300 with). He‚Äôs indeed very strong IF he has the star power. Otherwise, very squishy and easily bodied.
---
That is stupid 
---
Miiki: Doesn't want downvotes
---
Everyone: Nah
---
T H A N K S
---
But always use super before the teamate dead
---
Viva i prosciutti
---
I know mm is based off trophies, they should have another line of code to take into account power levels too. Since most people who have around 400 trophies are decent with whichever character they are on. So having two power tens with one of their mains against my teams zero is just unbalanced. 
---
And I know they were probably a premade team. So it‚Äôs more just me venting about how shit randoms I get and rng is awful. Can‚Äôt get points towards the characters I actually use. 
---
Lol not even close im at 7000 trophies I played before global so im better than you and still think these brawlers need a nerf
---
I know that you were reffering to your comment. Using petition in this sense is as stupid as those mobile game ads that say ‚Äúif you get to level 34, you‚Äôre legally skilled‚Äù
---
That was a great break down of common sense and knowledge, yet I wonder why there are so many refusing to see this...
---
Yea pretty much. This was like 5 games in a row. Hence my fristration of getting bad players and playing 1-2 power 10‚Äôs every game. 
---
Why a sequel?
---
Thanks
---
Gunna make it a series kind of deal with my low level brawlers at high trophies.
---
This title somehow reminds me of Daleks
---
Well it's the meta now, sorry
---
If you Team with someone with 100 total trophys while having yourself 5000, you'll get matched with people around 5000 and not in between like before. Idk if that's the case here though. 
---
I think a series should be on your YouTube channel
---
Playing mortis
---
Spend all ammo at once... walk in a straight line... PRO SKILLZ!
---
Wish people could have non toxic discussions on  reddit Instead of just calling everyone trash.
---
Noobs are gonna make this game successful sooo like maybe try to help them understand instead of being a douche?
---
Darryl is currently top tier but only if you have good knowledge of other brawlers capabilities. He does not need that star power to kick ass
---
Thank you! There was a part of the story that unfortunately disappeared from my notes.
---
Right now the best game mode for him is heist and brawl ball. Using his super over water allow him to cross it and to the safe, make him powerful if you right. He could carry brawl ball like motis used to be. And his star power is overpower. Basically double his health for more damage. Don't compare it to shelly or bull. Compare it to Motis
---
Dude, it‚Äôs a brawl stars subreddit. Everyone here knows the game and 99.999% plays it...
---
It was about 30%
---
Killed 1 person. What's the problem?
---
More like it‚Äôs a stupid trend that kids on Reddit use because they think for some reason it will get them karma
---
‚ÄúEndless trash talk potential‚Äù....I mean it doesn‚Äôt matter how many times you spam it your still going be saying ‚ÄúWow‚Äù 
---
Wait. That Tara..... FLAPETTE?! THATS ME!
---
he shorted 3 times... that‚Äôs the problem, had we been up closer, all of us would‚Äôve gotten rekt, I supered up close on a 7 power up bull and shelly while I was at 0 powerups, killed both of them with 3 back to back supers
---
it doesnt matter how much the company is worth, its still a small dev team. Do you want them to fix the game or add stupid useless things? thats my point.
---
She‚Äôs okay as she is
---
Can we use this picture on  [https://brawland.com/](https://brawland.com/) ? :D Thanks, Frank &lt;3
---
And? Don't group up against a shotgunner. I really don't see any issue with this.
---
Wow you got dingroll
---
But where is the: "Nice matchmaking" button tho?
---
Dynamike master race
---
Ok I was just asking for opinions on the game, jeez
---
**If I could control rewind** 
---
Thank you 
---
how do you avoid grouping when the enemy has the ball and going for the goal? run away?
---
What color do you want ur legendary?  Black usless poop,  green OP pickle or *not found*? 
---
It‚Äôs useless if you do not have every brawler 
---
Supressed?
---
Personally, wouldn't have been so passive and tried to attack the one above you more aggressively but I get the point that people teaming isn't fun in showdown.
---
Has 13 brawlers
---
So?
---
FLY FREE MY PRETTIES!
---
True, and bo I assume, that bird. I understand animal carcasses used for tribal like characters, it's understandable.
---
Leon is almost some urban kid with some hoodie. While it does look cool, I'd prefer if his hoodie had some type of red scarf instead of a tongue on the very tip. Then again, whatever, I don't use Leon. I don't like him either. 
---
You must‚Äôve not played other competitive games. In League of Legends there‚Äôs a ‚Äú?‚Äù Ping which is used to signal that enemies ar missing. Yet it‚Äôs mostly used to spam on teammates when they make a mistake. Trust me, someone spamming ‚ÄúWow‚Äù after a lost match isn‚Äôt a good thing
---
Btw cappy is the hat he is not under Mario's hat
---
Creepy af
---
Why? 
---
thats part of the idea, but u can see the shotguns,  otherwise i made this skin for fun, not pretend it serious, if u want u have more serious skins in my profile, soon more!

---
Hey, I'm new here, how do you get these brawler icons next to your username?
---
Ahh... 
---
mortis gang
---
Well looks like they did it ;)
---
Watch out dynamikes, There‚Äôs a mortis behind you, Oh shit they can‚Äôt hear us, They‚Äôre wearing extra hard helmets
---
Lol middle childs fire
---
Yeah, I did.. What's your point? 
---
I do but I‚Äôve had games with 2 players acting friendly towards each other not shooting each other when they are the last 2 standing.  
---
If they both queue at the same time it‚Äôs possible they could get in the same game.
---
2/10
---
Me too now I hope I can save some... ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
lol he just high on acid
---
Some also play bull and primo as an assassin if you think about it. Of course no passive super but still.
---
Daryll yeah, I could picture him being an assassin but just how he looks, I wouldn't call him that. 
---
You should be afraid too.
---
Yeah I understand that all too well haha, in order to keep positivity I suggested just having ‚ÄúWell played‚Äù ‚ÄúGood game‚Äù and ‚ÄúGot to go‚Äù
---
I‚Äôd love to see a Mortis skin where‚Äôs he‚Äôs in a knight outfit like Jessie so we would have:
---
A knight (Mortis)
---
An archer (Jessie)
---
A mage (barley)
---
That‚Äôs true, I had seen a video of the same situation last time it was in the rotation and was too distracted to see if this was the situation again
---
No she is balanced now you just gotta know how to play her, chip damage until you get your super and then you destroy people thats why shes my favourite brawler
---

How can someone have no problems with teaming??? Its so aids

I'm a creature of the night

Those solo victories tho

What if said cactus is spike

Already in it ahhahah

The mortar is supposed to an annoying thing that is behind your wall making it hard for them to destroy it putting it behind there is making thinks so much easier for them

Very cool!

It‚Äôs shellies just like baby and babies

Fuckin Right?? Or they run into their own goal with the goddamn ball or some stupid shit
---
Plot twist: the birds are controlling the dynamikes
---
There are reasons why Darryl points his guns at you during the victory animation. This is why. 
---
Is that Barley your friend?
---
I could be doing something wrong but I haven‚Äôt really felt a difference in Darryl‚Äôs DPS after the balance changes.
---
I domt understand how cant they just play duos like are they dumb??? Lot of people are trying to have fun and they are ruining it...
---
I think we all know the best counter to 90% of teamers..... Mortis gang

At the closest range it was up to 60%

Well my tinnitus has now become apparent as I turned sound on the very moment primo was revealed.

Maybe not 1 trophy per 1 kill. Probably 1 trophy per 2 kills.

Yeah I feel like some star powers need to be reworked.

It‚Äôs not that they are bad or anything but there is just a lot of potential that‚Äôs isn‚Äôt being used.
---
Much love for the game tho :) can‚Äôt wait for gene
---
Yep you just like me man...
---
I quit brawl star when i was just 2.8k trophies because i'm getting 27 lose streak in gem grab and solo SD . In solo SD, teamers are the most frustrating. Make me delete BS.
---
But then one day...
---
I met a dude with 7k trophies and saying that i should play brawl star again because there always hope and i *DID*. Starting with a new account, 5k trophies in just 2 week and I'm right now almost 7k trophies. The dude with 7k trophies right now is 10k trophies.
---
It'll be funny if regular Spike's voice is a boy then Sakura's Spike's voice is just a high pitched version of regular Spike's voice

That could be a special game mode

If I recall, there's already an app for this.
---
This looks like a peep marshmallow 
---
Good idea 
---
Accurate
---
Awww that's sweet
---
My point was illustrating that calling something out is different than just not liking it. Are you being obtuse on purpose, or is this actually hard to grasp?
---
Lmao
---
Either I‚Äôm a dumbass or something doesn‚Äôt add up. A max Poco at full health should have more than 4560 health, but yet the star power symbol is underneath him. Am I missing something or is this photo shop?
---
This made my day better, thanks.
---
No its not photoshop, I took this screenshot 2s ago
---
I wanted to display there is a difference between a max and not maxed poco skin
---
Thank god someone says it man. I was mad as fuck cause everyone is saying he is so op and I just saw a video of "chicken" a pretty big BS youtuber literally saying that he should be removed one of his points being "yOu cAn'T dO aNyThInG aBoUt HiS sUPeR" bitch please just get on a brush or even scout him since most of the time its pretty obvious when he is using his super.
---
I just got leon at 500 and even tho I played him before the nerfs I mostly played him at power 4/5/6 so I always had a power level dis-advantage to my other laner(always played him on gem grab and some bounty) so that made me learn a lot.
---
My point is that the small nerf on his dmg and the 2 seconds from his super were enough to balance him( I would even bring his close range dmg back) for the reasons u already stated. Also rico/darryl buffs are indirect nerfs to leon on team based modes since all experienced leon players would agree on that to be able to beat laners like rico,dinamike,barley,spike... u gotta dodge all of their poke and gain distance wich happens to be extremly hard if u are facing a good rico or they are using spike. And for darryl well he is now able to 1vs1 leon with his INSANE 40% damage reduction and health advantge. 
---
Leon is getting so much hate cause it became a meme like the "better nerf irelia" on league of legends and also because braindead youtubers like chicken are spreading this bullshit while none is pointing out the fact that darryl is way more overpowered then any brawler except maybe rico with his insane starpower+range+even tho It's hard to play you can dominate huge areas using his passive correctly. And what about spyke? Yes he has low health but he also has an insane basic attack thats covers a gigantic area while being able to shoot from really safe spots and also being able to deal 1.8k(3 spike hits) on short range wich can help him delete some assasins wich is super unfair since its already so hard to get to close range against spike... oh and the slow on his super is pretty huge.
---
He is definetly strong on gem grab If u are skilled and can lane against these hard match ups (spikex rico...) and he is also pretty strong on bounty but definetly not op in none of them. In heist isnt really that great.
---
Won't talk about showdown cause it is not really a competitive game mode sinces there's so much RNG on it(u depend on how much of an asshole ur opponents are).
---
*SCP 49 HAS BREACHED CONTAINMENT*

---
What MulTVrse said. I also play with randoms mostly, cos I want that added challenge. Credit to supercell where credit is due, matchmaking has improved A LOT. 
---
Brawlstars is like real sports. Unless you are all elite level players, there‚Äôs no way you can get away with not playing as a team. And even if you are, you‚Äôre usually found out when playing against moderately strong players who work as a tight unit.
---
So if you are playing randoms and lose a high percentage of the time, it just means that you‚Äôre skills are not enough to carry your team if you need to. I.e. it‚Äôs a fair reflection of your skill level. Let‚Äôs not kid ourselves.
---
The only way to overcome this is you have to look inwardly and identify the areas you can improve. 
---
I too went thru a horror spell as well recently where I was stuck with Tara playing for 20 odd hours before I overturned a 80 plus trophy deficit.
---
Then I proceeded to drop another 70 trophies with colt and again, another close to 20 hours of grinding to get back again. 
---
It was really painful and I had the bruises to prove it ‚Äì I literally raged and headbutt random shit out of sheer frustration ‚Äì but ultimately I became a better player through the experience. Not by much, though lol, and I expect to have to go through these mini slumps again in order to go to the next level.
---
If you choose not to ‚Äògrow‚Äô with a club by constantly interacting and learning from other teammates then the learning process is a lot harder. But I understand from what you said that you want to play in a certain way. Fair enough. Just don‚Äôt give up if you love the game. You deserve better.

Ok, thanks!
