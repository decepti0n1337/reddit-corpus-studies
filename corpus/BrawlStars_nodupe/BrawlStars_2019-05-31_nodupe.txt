Sorry, that was on accident.

Leon too
---
Idk I just know he used to triple jump in GG coral to win 100%-100% games at the last second, probably hasn‚Äôt done anything else doe bcuz he hasn‚Äôt got training cave
---
The day he was released this was the map we could play
---
Hey can you make Leon next?
---
Epic drawings
---
What. What do you mean? This isnt a repost, and if it is, show me the post
---
no
---
and please dont put that here
---
leon is too much OVER POWER
---
I‚Äôm not the one that made the joke

It's fine, I gave them both an upvote

nope. robots can't reproduce k

Thanks!

Reported. Can‚Äôt be linking NSFW content for a game that kids play too, man. Especially when some of the characters are canonically underage...
---
I was thinking about doing Leon next so I‚Äôll probably do it

Yup. And now we‚Äôre getting road rage Carl while it‚Äôs in rotation too.

you bet!üëç

YOU MAKE ME POCO LOCO

Spike has never been so delicious üòã

makes me lose trophies (just got -50 today but got that sweet star token) and brawl ball is actually fun without much more risk
---
Yea, I just like making maps and then posting them on here
---
YESSS
---
With that logic we should get two for the big games
---
Same! I haven't had any great ideas in a while though.
---
pike
---
Now instead of 100 trophies for a star token, it‚Äôs 200
---
It's not default.
---
Some people... Celebrate that weird festival in mainland China where humans eat dogs ...
---
 But not us
---
I usually just make it up as I go
---
Whatever it takes
---
You can get Piper in brawl ball though
---
*"GEOLOGY ROCKS"*

It‚Äôs translates to ‚Äúyour gems are gone lol‚Äù
---
Huh. I should try that
---
No
---
They are both good
---
Good job man it looks really nice.

How good do you think my map was?

Piper‚Äôs really only good in solo showdown with energy drinks and bounty. Outside of those game modes, she struggles. If you learn how to effectively dodge shots and take advantage of her wack close range, she isn‚Äôt as broken as you think she is.

I think club takes precedence over friend atleast I would rather it since most club mates are in my friends list I would want to see if they are a club friend or like a random friend who you friended for playing 20 odd games together.

I can‚Äôt see the image so I‚Äôm assuming this is Carl cuz of your comment

Have a toggle feature personally I wish there was a toggle feature now I don't like knowing people are watching it puts me under a lot of stress. Like not to team even if if you don't you die I'd rather lose trophies then be caught teaming.
---
Allow me to go over this one last time. Yes I commented in this post, I was unclear of what I had said and choose words that could be taken with different meaning and recommended a subreddit that nobody cared about in my comment, I replayed to you these many time not to convince you I'm innocent or because I'm insecure and let other peoples word define me, I'm replying because I'm simply doing my dang hardest to solve this problem by being humble, kind, and knowing my mistakes, I'm only human am I not? Yes it is true that I @ you on a different post, but that was only so I can have assistance to help manage this burden a little easier, I had no intentions of sending an army to down vote you to oblivion and when I believed I had handled the situation I said in short "No I'm fine I had managed it by being humble" but it appeared I'm not done yet and @ you only sparked more against me and let me repeat my self, I had No intentions of sending an army to down vote you, only to have some one to resolve this situation, and you decided to reply to my comment instead of formally (but you are replying to me formally now) you just sent a harsh message with no meaning and I decided instead of staying in my comfort zone, to take a stand by reasoning, see unlike what you think of me because I am replying to you again only making you think I'm insecure and want my way that is not at all true my friend, what I do is compromise or meet in the middle because everything would be better if it were distributed equally than having a war for just one way, and I apologize for all the backlash I've stirred up these past few hours even if you don't forgive me I'll still forgive you because its the bigger person thing to do than continue with an argument that'll go nowhere and maybe next time I'll see what my message can mean to others than what I think of it as, and hopefully we can shake hands forgive what we've both said and continue on with our lives. You have my apology even if you don't apologize at least I was able to let go sorry, good bye, and have a super sharp bull's eye day!
---
He have Dynamike as highest what tf do u expect
---
Brawl T.v is seperate this wouldn't affect it
---
Amazing teach me...
---
How are they random and from club? Random would mean like someone else has a club mate or friend spectating them but they are random for you
---
Yeah there are millions of people who do such troll things you just have to deal with it
---
Thanks. She's definitely one of my weaker brawlers though. Much prefer playing my Crow.
---
Made with anxiety and crippling depression
---
How many times u blowed up ur phone because of Carl?
---
Rage. We could have won if we had a third team mate dealing damage. Did you see how many times that Bibi had a few health left? What about all the times that Barley stood in the middle wide open for a gene - grab.
---
It is always like this to prevent unfair pushing tro√ºhies. In the way you have expected you could take 1 trophies friend and play with 200+ players when you are at 400+. Easy to abuse this way.
---
Bad joke
---
&gt; You're probably the type of person who teams in Showdown and scores on their own goal in brawl ball.
---
&gt; I think we both mostly agree however so hopefully we can still be friends :)
---
Bruh
---
It says a lot when his own friend makes a comment.
---
Technically you have already scored because ball was beyond the line, but yeah it looks a bit weird

Ew. Duos.

Bro, that was mediocre at best, if they rushed you, u woulda got toasted. Plus I always team, ppl like you are what destroy the game.

You team because you have no skill and you ruin the game by double teaming people with talent

bro that‚Äôs illegal

Watch till it ends‚ÄîI avoided Piper's shot (or I just can say it missed) to survive and then avoided close range Penny's shot at the end to kill her
---
If one of those shots hits me, I'll never win
---
That's good news to hear. His club page does look like an official Nova club though. I posted a link showing the page on my first comment. Maybe you could say something to the President or Co via discord.

Sorry

Repost cuz my dumbass said bounty

Wait is the reload speed like pipers or any other brawler
---
Everyone who likes Mortis is welcome
---
Great! I can tell this isn‚Äôt just a traced model from the game, as bakesale barley holds the pie in the other hand.
---
It‚Äôs definitely not an official Nova club, they have a completely different discord server from us. Lastly, I don‚Äôt want to start conflict with anyone so you should join their server if you really want to call him out.
---
MINE WOULD BE CüòçLT
---
The thing is, that littlerabbit guy has actually gone back and edited his comments so now you don't know what his 2nd comment was. He's a manipulative weasel.
---
49%
---
Sometimes it‚Äôs because of lag, this looks like lag here.
---
May you please explain how I‚Äôm ‚Äúoverreacting.‚Äù And how he isn‚Äôt being unreasonable too. How does my IQ have anything to do with the morality of -5 trophies in a game due to a troll?
---
No ones defending it, but you can‚Äôt just ban people for doing something that‚Äôs not covered in the rules. Like he said, refer to the earlier reply. Add this to the rules and he‚Äôll stop. If not, ban him afterwards. Also, in clash Royale, Nova (as well as some other organizations) had ‚Äúfeeder clans‚Äù which were full of people throwing games to help the main clan push trophies. If the people on the other team were also in a nova club, that‚Äôs probably what‚Äôs happening and this person is far from the only one.
---
This is incredibly cool and also incredibly threatening
---
I don't get it, he wasn't p2w?
---
You drew better than me dude
---
Am I the only one who was seeing those amazing Dynamike trick jumps. Well done
---
Booooooooo what a tattletale
---
You can become a skin designer if you do those stuffs in 3D
---
Dunno, but we won like hell :P
---
SO MUCH FOR MY EYES TO TAKE IN
---
His original reply has been edited. In that reply at 1st he defended the guy in the video. Now he's changed that comment to say "Let's keep things family friendly" because he's a manipulative rat.
---
Very entertaining. I played a brawl ball game against Jarod and scienceisthekey yesterday. Hades was their 3rd. I had 2 players on my team in the 12-13k range. Awesome game. So much fun to be paired with 5 other players who understand how to play. Ended 0-0, but man. I‚Äôd take 0-0 games with 5 other people who know how to play over the shitty randoms I win or lose with any day.
---
Your new legendary chance is 0.0096% or your old one before pulling crow was?
---
Having more than 10 gems as el primo makes the bar go out of the frame
---
So basically you realised you weren't coming off very well because you defended the guy in the video and then went back to edit your comment to try and look better than you are. I can't believe you had a kid. Someone actually had to want to sleep with someone as manipulative and arrogant as you.
---
Yeah, I will, 'Cause he helps to distract them and also he takedown that Brock
---
I would kill for that legendary brawler chance
---
Patetic post
---
If you tilt a brawler, it means that the brawler now has less trophies than he/she had when he/she reached that rank.
---
He's right doesn't matter if what the guy in game did was a dick move he didn't break any rules quit crying
---
So, what was in comment before edit?
---
Xd. But i promise, it will be fun to play.
---
im poor

Yes indeed

Do we know why it is 1/3? What happens when you purchase? Is there another offer?

IsmISMillustration

That is not true for some people, I mean I had Mike Star Power at 4k trophies because when I got Mike I only gave him the boosts to level 9 and in one day I got his Star Power from a big box after a mass opening! And I am good with the Star Power now at 6k trophies.
---
Holy shit

Op but i like it

The only one that make sense here is grabing power cube.

I am Egyptian too!
---
good edit...lol
---
Great, then why did you have to insult he dude for not having a star power at 7k? I didn‚Äôt even get my first star power until 10k.
---
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm thinking too.. it‚Äôs so sad to see no offer in shop just like bibi. Really expensive for gems. 80 gems for a skin, not reasonable. They drop the offers continually..
---
u/IsmISMillustration is the real creator behind this skin idea and artwork
---
just please next time think twice before you post anything in reddit :)

Ikr. I can stand it for about 3 matches before my ears start bleeding. I think the lines are okay though, just the way he says it grates on my brain.

So you admit to being a teamer?

oHmEH gAwD I wAntEd cRoW

Because it is for how long it is at the top of the shop instead of where you usually buy skins.
---
Oh....... Well, at least that‚Äôs enough to upgrade my Lvl 1 brawlers
---
"Well yes, but actually no"
---
Yeah, it was made before dude
---
they probably wont as supercell cant make money from it
---
bUt i wAnTEd LeOn!
---
who did? :( I'm sorry it was not intentional. I did check other works esp gedi-kor and other artists (I don't remember their name) and I didn't see this so I assumed it was not made yet :(
---
that's very kind of you. thank you :)
---
 No
---
well supercell is greedy and they want you to spend money. the countdown will make it look like its worth it.(dont get me wrong i do like this skin )
---
I honestly don‚Äôt remember who, but I‚Äôm sure that it was. But for me if it isn‚Äôt intentional it‚Äôs okay that also you do that :)
---
so true
---
I'm not making stuff up. You know exactly what I meant. Why spend so much time and effort trying to make a pointless point? The win to loss ratio is 50%... draws are an edgecase that doesn't really factor into the point. But if it makes you happy let's call it a win loss ratio.
---
Yes, I'm really sorry :( That's actually what I was afraid of, that someone did this before and I'm not aware. I do my best to come up with original ideas. If the ideas are borrowed/inspired, I always mention them :)
---
move while shooting and use the mines in gem grab / heist (on the safe)/ and also around you to bait others
---
Ryan&gt;Frank in terms of dealing with community issues, Change my mind
---
its just a meme
---
What could mortis do against him?
---
Yeah I know that's what I was asking. Have you unlocked these brawlers already and the icons haven't unlocked because of a bug or something?
---
just a meme
---
No it‚Äôs just a bigger purchase button basically, I‚Äôll suggest you to wait for some random offer because that skin is not going anywhere
---
No i dont have em
---
JUST A MEME
---
3 times the same offer
---
It's 3 times the same offer, someone found the packs [here] (https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/bso8ty/datamine_may_update_datamine/).
---
Thanks. You‚Äôre doing good work. My money was on BSB because of her high-heeled shuffle.
---
Why would you ever play mortis on thousand lakes?
---
Everybody's reaction: YOU JUST WANT MORTIS TO BE OVERPOWERED
---
Everybody's intention: farm morti as powercubes in showdown
---
those who upvote: XP
---
Nooooooooooooooo :(
---
Oh! What a discount 0 gems off!!!
---
sucks to be you
---
It was created because Darius stole the art to point out other people who steal art. r/antidariusbrawlstars check it out and see 
---
that it matches my description
---
Personally I think it‚Äôs a good price, even without a discount like from 80 to50 gems or something. It looks badass, has some sick animations and concept in general is really good. If anything, this would probably originally be 150 gems and now it‚Äôs 80. Hopefully my opinion helps with the situation
---
*random critical grenade launcher flashback intensifies*
---
Hmm
---
I need that in my room
---
I don't need a phucen vo
---
Your probably right but i keep my opinion
---
You are romanian too
---
My favourite brawler is spike. Got his star power two days ago.
---
I know, it was a joke.
---
bad manners like spamming emojis in cr
---
Lol why
---
The knockback boiii
---
It's not about the discount. It is about them saying it is on offer when it is just the original price. It's like buying an item that original price is $50, and the discounted price is $50 because SALEEEEEE or NEW OFFFFEEERRRRR
---
Dude she make me wet so sexy body I want **** her so hard
---
*hehehe* My calculations are **always** correct
---
For reference:
---
Road rage Carl is 80, has unique effects.
---
Bunny penny is 80, unique effects. 
---
Sakura spike is 80, unique effects. 
---
Viking bull is 80, and is totally worth it. 
---
The skin doesn't justify the cost, and it really crumbles in comparison to the other Brock skins and other 80 gem skins. 
---
I honestly would rather pay 80 for Rockstar Colt than Beach Brock
---
Hey i made a slightly different post from this 1 month ago 
---
Not complaining good work
---
My answer to you is No. Last season when i pushed him to 736 trophies he was one of the hardest to push. Yes you're right he is a high skillcap but if we conpare him to the other close range brawler he's the worst.
---
Why would you watermark this? You traced it amd them coloured it with a computer. That‚Äôs not that hard.
---
remembering that the wodde status is already at maximum level
---
But it can‚Äôt be because I can see it
---
Small  easter egg: when are you repeating this video, quilaty is worser And worser
---
You literally just downloaded this game, don't you?
---
Discounts on skins
---
Sorry it is out of context but could someone tell me how to post something on reddit because i don't know how to do.
---
Which one's your favorite?
---
Why is your penny a third of your total trophies
---
I one trick her
---
I'm not one to use gems on cosmetics in these types of games, but this would tempt me ;) . Nice artwork.
---
Talk about maining a brawler
---
So, what you mean is that you're ruining showdown cause you aren't skilled enough to win? 
---
Are you kidding us or something like that?
---
I didnt know there was another one, sorry
---
Was being kind and letting you know
---
it's between Leon, Nita, or Piper
---
https://youtu.be/3w_RdJpfuXs
---
Shelly's super isn't the best and I have a pro to talk about it.
---
also white crow doesn't have anything unique, just the texture
---
I just said exactly the same as that guy but two hours later.
---
Youre able to buy it 3 times
---
hell yea one trick
---
He killed that meme already, the battle is over.
---
Omg.He has showed us what he had allready known.
---
That's what each brawl stars YouTuber has said multiple times in each of their videos
---
You go to Brawl Stars subreddit then click "create post" found in the right side of the screen :) hope this helps
---
That is just marketing like it is a limited offer. I am pretty shure you will get simmilar offers even if you buy this 3 times
---
aw thank you :') really appreciate it!

It's so true this skin worth 150 and they could discount him for 119 and no one has a problem but for me the problem is that all the skins they add is 80+ gems and f2p like me even the hardcores (im 10.5k) cant buy any of them
---
Ouch
---
XD
---
Rarely, but yeah. I think I‚Äôve had it happen 2-3 times
---
Anything above 100 is 100+!
---
Nah I‚Äôve decided that if I‚Äôm going to play the game I‚Äôm going to play the game for fun. I‚Äôll be saving my gems for skins from now onwards.
---
He wasn't teaming? They were the last two.
---
Those were the last 2 teams left. How can they team? That was just bm‚Äôing.
---
No a mean a game round

Only 2 teams left. How can they team?

Okay, now you're trying to make me look bad using cheap and stupid arguments.

Are you really a parent? How old is your kid? Did you adopt them or you 'made' them? If you 'made' them consenting, how did a rational living person agreed to have a relationship with you and raise a child with you?

Good catch. I don‚Äôt understand why people feel the need to steal ideas like this. Just shows a lack of confidence in their own abilities. Really just sad

That"s a weird costume for Rosa

Not just 10K+ players. I‚Äôm at 6.7K and it‚Äôs the se down here. Don‚Äôt want to push brawlers to 500 so keeping them at 400.

I feel like this was more to bring it to the attention of  very casual players who don‚Äôt check brawl stars related social media or the news section.

Yep, i know how people like you work. You make every single thing be about you, you manipulate the truth, ignore a part of the truth, just to make you seem/feel right and the other person wrong.. I've encountered many people like you, but i just can't understand why they would do that, is it because of ego? Greedy? I like when people like you show up so i can try to find an answer to these questions.
---
Now..
---
**You:**
---
&gt;May you please explain how I‚Äôm ‚Äúoverreacting.‚Äù And how he isn‚Äôt being unreasonable too. How does my IQ have anything to do with the morality of -5 trophies in a game due to a troll?
---
**Me:**
---
&gt;You're being arrogant and ignorant, and i'm sorry but doing this is dumb.
---
I think you didn't catch what i meant, so i'll explain:
---
Brawl Stars is a game, games are supposed to be fun.. If someone, in a Multiplayer online game with an objective, ruins the game, then.. They just ruins the game, the whole point of it, they make you frustated, mad, and bored, make you wanna do something else, which, in case of that happening very much, will lead many players to stop playing Brawl Stars. (That happened with "Among Us", sadly)
---
People here aren't "overreacting" because Op lost 5 trophies, but because it's happening to many of them.
---
The actual answer: Saying that "this is nothing" is kinda dumb, and people are saying you're overreacting because you were/are arrogant while defending a really bad and kinda dumb realization about this situation.
---
Pssssshhhttt don't ruin his fantasy

its not even in the correct orientation

And i don't really need any of those, i'm happy with myself, i'm happy by not being an asshole locked in a ignorant imaginary mental world, living a possibly sad life and most likely surrounded by people who act exactly like you. ~~Also, i don't really want a wife or a husband, children or toxic people around me~~

You have no clue about age. Your emotional intelligence age though seems to be about 5. Following is definitely not closer to fulfilling than it it is to attempt. Fulfilling suggests completion. Following doesn't mean something has been fulfilled but the effort is made to try.
---
Bo gets decreased land mine detonation times. Call it Short Fuse.
---
Rosa gets percentage of damage mitigated by shield converted to health. 
---
Piper does full power shots regardless of range on next shot, after using super. 
---
Penni's cannon now explodes on death in a large radius. Heavy damage close in and it decreases the farther out. Terrain destruction only in the small heavy damage radius.
---
Bibi's super leaves a sticky mess on the ground for a few seconds. After it pops. Rooting an enemy for a second or two.

That‚Äôs literally my teammates every time until I never play minecart madness with randoms now.

It‚Äôs because Supercell originally made the brawlers with an outdated model format‚Äî they would have to recreate Tara from scratch just to make one skin, so more than one would be very tedious. Instead, Supercell is giving all of the older characters remodels so that they can layer skins on top, which is way more efficient. For more detail, I believe that KairosTime made a YouTube video which explains this.

Epic skin

How did you made it? Awesome!

I am confused as to what it wrong with this. If it's their English grammar, cut them a break, it's not their first language. If it's something else, please, tell me.

its not her current model people don't like its just she and the other brawlers that need remodels aren't 3d rendered

English is not my native language either. So stop using it as an execuse. "Oh, it might not be their first language". So what? Also, they use emojis which are awful. I mean, there was no context. They just put them there for no reason.

r/brawlrecruit is where you should go if you want to recruit people.
---
This would be a sick character. Shoots explosives that can go over walls and if they fail to hit their target they explode in a radius similar to one dynamite. Something like 1K damage on direct hit and explosion damage is determined by how far they are from the center of the radius.
---
Super could be a demo knight charge that does a good amount of damage on impact and stops when it hits a target.
---
Basically a direct hit thrower with a charge. So kinda a mix between the different character types.

Have you ever thought that sometimes they aren‚Äôt going to give us like a 30% discount on everything and that they‚Äôre a business concerned with profits sometimes? The majority of people who buy a skin buy it during the first few days so now is the best time for them not to discount it if they want to make money. Why are there people like you who are so greedy that they don‚Äôt understand that the people working on the game need money smh

They did give us gold packs in the shop

Nothing is wrong with teaming. Are you saying that since I was stuck in a bad area and got bullied out of a power cube I should just lose? Nah I'm charismatic not stupid. What if youre in the last 3, you have 3 cubes, and the others have 4 and 16? You just accept 3rd or 2nd place? Nothing's more annoying than trying to chip at the guy with 13 cubes in a 1v1v1 as the other dumbass solidifies his spot at 2nd. Sorry man but teaming isnt evil its a power in our hands to smite those more fortunate (with power cubes) than us
