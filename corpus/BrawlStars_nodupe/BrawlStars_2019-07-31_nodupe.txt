It was awful. If you think cavern churn is bad with teaming throwers, you should see hot maze. It can stay right where it is.

I‚Äôve added boxes near every spawn and in between the teams at the corners to fix that XD you can zoom in on the photo to see the boxes

Throwers where complete cancer on this map

And gem grab remodel

Nope actually. It‚Äôs a huge coincidence. While making the maps I just tried to make every single type of brawler viable, and that was just the result. When people pointed it out I was shocked Xd

Thanks.

This died on new...sad

I just read that they can't remove skins from any account and if they refund you gems it would be unfair for other players because you just got a skin for free. Sorry man, feel bad for you :(

Just because Bull and Pam have the same hair style doesn't mean they're married. It could be because they have the same father but different mothers. The father had a Pompadour hair style so then Bull got the style because he liked it. P has it so she can remember her Dad.

 Hey man, great play! can i use your videos for youtube vid, i making a compilation videos for great play. Thanks :)

Bull‚Äôs skull on the belt looks like a messed up boner

I would love to see Kirb as a playable character!

No, star powers don't decrease your legendary chance, only new brawlers.
---
(It is more valuable to wait for the star power to drop than to buy it)
---
such a liar if rico was 569, why isn't he rank 20?

Primo!

Yeah, that's how the system works, it happen to me to many times, if you reconnect at the time, you are gonna get the trophies

Yes of course!

Oh. I love the Amazon. To get your packages on time every time!

Honestly, it‚Äôs a no win situation. Think how quick duo teams kill a bot. Now imagine bots spawning over and over near teamers. The team. Kill the bot. Split the cubes, new bot appears. Repeat the above until the teamers now how have 42 cubes each. Have fun!

Man, I'm glad they remodeled bo. He looked like a 40 year old white guy, who's pretending to be native american. New bo skin is much better.

Maybe it's just me, but it looks just like the weapons in the game!Great job

Let's say you went up and attacked someone but you got low on health. You can use Invisiheal to quickly get back into the fight.

I had the same thing in mind when i saw the post
---
Everyone is random you know, but im waiting for teammate in duo till he respawns and then pick power cubes, passing the ball in BB, don't jump to enemys with 10 gems

How can he wait four months for him when he got released 7 months ago

because maybe they didnt want leon for the first 3 months of him being released genius
---
Leon was op at this time
---
I have to say, I agree, doesn‚Äôt mean I can‚Äôt be happy about it
---
Do the math : 
---
2MB = 20BB = 20x 0.25% = 5% to get mythic (you need 20MB for half a chance)
---
or 20x 0.07% = 1.4% to get legendary (70MB for half a chance).
---
With 98gem you can buy special offer token doubler for more BB.
---
what does that have to do with this
---
like it
---
but Supercell will make the price high as golden mecha crow

Hahaha... I'm actually old.I am 40 years old. I've been painting since I was a kid, and it was terrible back then. I drew it in earnest since I was in high school, and I didn't study painting separately. I just drew it the way I like it. And I went to an animation company. After about 10 years, I quit because I didn't fit in with the company. Now I spend my time painting the pictures that I want to draw.

Yeah that can happen it happens with the gems in gme grab and power cubes in showdown where if you kill the person just befroe the object disappear s it can still stay on the ground but rare for that to happen

How many trophies has the brawlers you are playing with?

In that case, you can turn it off

As a punishment the players character should be put in the training map. Everytime they get hit by a newbie they lose 1 trophy.

Guys, I'm shaking. I'm fucking shaking. I never wanted to breed with anyone more than I want to with Jessie. That perfect, curvy body. Those bountiful breasts. The child bearing hips of a literal goddess. It honestly fucking hurts knowing that I'll never mate with her, pass my genes through her, and have her birth a set of perfect offspring. I'd do fucking ANYTHING for the chance to get Jessie pregnant. A N Y T H I N G. And the fact that I can't is quite honestly too much to fucking bear. Why would Supercell create something so perfect? To fucking tantalize us? Fucking laugh in our faces?!

Honestly guys, I just fucking can't anymore. Fuck

I agree with you in one point, the game is slowly removing f2p rewards but it doesn't make the game trash, i mean yeah i'm trigerred too that they removed a lot of f2p rewards but the game is still enjoyable even though Brawl Stars is less f2p friendly than before but you know they can still add new f2p things in the game..

Piper will litteraly have her original range (before she got nerfed)

That thing could turn invisible it is next to you

I could have eat him but I chose not too I am also trying to be vegan (with mortis not real life)

You all retarded its sou dumb why you use that all player attack to you nevertheless

YES! YEEEESSSSS!
---
Not just Bibi, it‚Äôs the case with anyone with Coiled Snake, even Mortis himself. They just need to fix the indicator.

That was a Big Boss win lmao.
---
How does a picture of a couple bullets get 1.2k upvotes..?
---
Lol my bad. I was so furious that i misstyped
---
I agree one hundred percent. They should of left the mode the same but adjusted the trophy loss
---
Do you use leon? I use him and it would be extremely helpful to me
---
what would happen to people without weapons like leon or nits
---
Sono chi no sadame!!! JOOOOOOJOO!!!

Yes, he deserves to get banned for 2 things:

1. He threw the game
---
2. He is using NO HAT MORTIS

Thx lol some weird lil kid was mad i asked üòÇüòÇ

Ok not going to lie if this was your sisters than say it on the title that it was your sisters. Also that looks cool but not mortis

Dynamike jokes are funny but no hat mortis is blasphemy

Nice but how do you get that trophy statistics graph
---
And children have the common sense to know that it's a joke. Especially since he did the same thing with Darryl before.

So does. Spike shove spikey balls in his mouth?

---
Pretty normal Situation. What is your point?
---
Kind of a related point here; the inflation *did* make trophy pushing easier, but as a consequence of that it also diluted quite a bit of the player base, and finding good randoms somehow has become more difficult.
---
Yep!
---
I don‚Äôt know if any of you guys collect funkos but I do and I saw this and though I‚Äôd post. Once again all credits go to Craft by K on YouTube. He/she also makes clay brawl stars figurines.  Super cool!
---
Yeah. I know, that's why I said something with the time line breaking allowing all eras into modern day.
---
Not hard to do with Leon‚Äôs long reload speed
---
Smart dynamike will predict a dash and super at his feet
---
That's a Big Duck!

Thank you

bruh üò´üòéüòéü§£üòÇ
---
What did he say?
---
Also be able to report people for teaming in showdown
---
Sounds like a Karen to me
---
The gem spawner cant be covered with bushes. I think this is a rule in brawl stars because then first time players will be really confused if this map is in rotation when they start playing.
---
Yeah exactly, so it would suck to be standing there
---
Poyo!

A sub filled with Nsfw stuff. Don't go there.

I‚Äôm not asking if it says 1%, I‚Äôm asking if anyone has noticed it taking well over 100 boxes to get a new star power since the release of the new star powers

You mran photoshppped it?
---
i got fucking 1300 upvotes for a clip with 0 followers lol
---
The fact you consider El Primo human and not God is beyond me
---
I hope they never remove the star power glitch because it affects competitive gameplay in no way, plus it‚Äôs not possible in friendly games with more than one person
---
Frank couldn‚Äôt be made out of stone because then he would be like a statue that has no flexibility or movement

WOWWOWOWOWOWOWOW

In the picture layer, I selected the parts I wanted to colour in first with the magic wand tool (in paint.net, dunno how it`s called in Photoshop :P). After that I simply created another layer and filled the selected area with different brushes (for blending purposes).
---
Oh, and thanks ^-^
---
theorically this dina has more than 18300 health.  Damage would go upper than 10000. means instakill for dina but mortis will ned more than 6 shots to kill him. XD this time dina is winner
---
That‚Äôs a lot of balls. ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)

Well he looks like he'll be able to handle those spikes

But on power level 1 he only does 700 damage

It's like a star skin of sakura spike

In a ranked game, over 50, in a friendly, over 100

IM EATING MA BALLS!

here is piper btw she can shoot 2 times with the star power active

I'm not very good at designing maps...

The two islands close to the middle are only for Solo Showdown, so there are no Duo Showdown "green generators" in those islands.
---
THOT ALERT delet dis now üö®
---
Okay wut
---
Oh my god who touched sasha??
---
No its patrick
---
Band-aid is not the only reason this is needed. This is also because of Piper, Poco, Shelly's super or when you are in a map which has not enough walls.
---
Also,if people say Leon's farthest damage needs a nerf,then why not Colt also? Each of his bullet deals 300 damage,1800 damage in total. If each level 1 Leon's blade deals 350 damage,that would be 1400 damage in total,why not nerf Colt first?
---
I already have this idea before Band-Aid comes out, but since I don't know how to describe it,it was delayed. 
---
Now Band-aid is here, I spent more time to think about it,and announce this idea.
---
I just used Band-aid as one of the reasons of why I want this buff since band-aid appeared.
---
Evidently we do

Commenting the same thing over and over again isn't humorous.

Wait that means that the skins are better than originals which means they pay to winüòû (I'm F2P)

–†–û–°–°–ò–Ø
---
Maybe 5 or 7 cause piper left a d pipwr right so yuh to many peepss
---
Any brawler is pretty weak on power 1 thus getting 500 on them is a nice achivement.
---
Removed. Rule 3. No providing information on how to break Supercell Terms of Service.
---
Cool, he almost looks like a peanut character. Nice job. üëç
---
And that is what i call a pro dynamike
---
im just following the chain i dont make the rules
---
also i misread and thought it was rhe same comment oof
---
Nice play with dyna
---
I was playing with frenk in that map and killed literally everyone in the map lol
---
No because I don‚Äôt have Leon üòî üò¢
---
Yes belongs here perfect
---
of course
---
Would be cooler if this was accomplished with a skilled brawler
---
Shelly: I see this am absolute win
---
Nice a lot of walls bushes and open space
---
If you see a glow pink RUN !!
---
Band aid op
---
Wait, gem rush got removed why
---
Great :)
---
Many pro players and players with a high playtime agree that she sucks. She is bad in GG, Siege, Brawl Ball. She is good in that one full bush Bounty Map and overall decent in showdown.

Is that a CARL reference?

That's because they are bad, dear.
---
We should get 5 tokens for every kill
---
Shellshock? Biggest trash in the game lmao. You want Band-Aid. Trust me
---
Maybe remove scoring in your own goal, the ‚Äúfun‚Äù gets removed for the trolls even though they might camp outside the enemies goal with the ball anyway
---
This is pretty much asking for downvotes just cause people will meme you now
---
Not exactly ugly better word would be unpolished
---
Oh my god. I never noticed that.
---
Bruh why ship them? They are brother and sister it feels wrong to ship them
---
Same with Bibi. You can see her Baseball bat spinning. If she has star power then you can see arrows going around her

He was unpolished, and that's a fact, the fact that he was ugly is just my personal thought
---
I think you're just bad. 1K trophies. Come on. Goodbye then. We will probably not miss you.
---
Ok. Yeah he does look much better now. Also don't you think this Subreddit is obsessed with Mortis??
---
Wow, it was you dio
---
No, this is not a repost. I think you are talking about the one where you hit two people with colts super
---
Small advantage i suppose. Without context it seemed like you made an account to see how long it would take. Some people go as far as to never upgrade anyone for the challenge. Anyway, thanks for following up
---
And spin spin until you win win to team with al other mikes
---
Yes, it's absolutely obsessed, but we both know that the best brawler is piper
---
Cot him at 3500 lol ,he so fun, and for me is quite easy to use
---
BUT I CAN MAKE HOLE THROUGH MY GLASS AND ADD MA BALLS THERE
---
Downgrade

Fr because he dated both üòÇ

You are absolutely correct. BTW how many trophies you have??

Shes 12

What

Like you can talküòô, Hun.
---
This kid is like more stupid than a potato
---
I have now 14k trophies but my record is 14.4k
---
Create a friendly game ( can be on any game mode) select brawler with interesting star power select another brawler and REALLY fast click select and play the better your internet is the harder it will be to pull this off but give it a try and then you can tell me if its cool or not :D
---
You need to go up my friend

Basically big game but with a safe

I‚Äôm friends with Morti Kind though

this is still funny

Yeah i like it that way, thats how the game was intended.

There is literally no proof that this is yours. You don‚Äôt have a watermark, you have zero art related history, and not even a single link. This is stolen

Dude this is actually mine, I‚Äôm sorry that I didn‚Äôt draw a watermark... but that‚Äôs a heavy accusation. If there‚Äôs any way I could prove that this is mine, I can provide proof.

there is a difference between hentai and porn, also my phone doesn't do it so...

this is beyond science

The title makes me cringe... otherwise nice idea

I don't have a mouth:(

How it feels when trying to run away from an el primo.
---
Nice, good job!
---
It's the best feeling to have a good thrower. Nothing worse than that. Other than a noob mortis.
---
I already did that!
---
You can check out my profile! üòÉ

711 trophies with mortis. Impressive
---
Thank you!

815 pb :)) trying to get 900+ this season

How can you bypass the no hat curse so easily?

He would look better if he had a hat üé©!

i am the god mortis. that's how i guess. now FEEL MY WRATH

i can do one with the hat too. i think i can say i have mastered the art of the screenshot :)

I‚Äôm trying to get there with frank, got to 800 last season as well

Well... i don't have any sheets but I kept listening to that losing bgm and recorded instruments. (Or... TeChNoLoGy Is NoT tHeRe YeT.)

wow. i really struggle with frank. got him to 500 as a lvl 2 in cavern churn before the trophy update but my best is 601 with his first star power :| im really bad with him.

Seems like the easiest target to no way he beats a shelly with bandaid
---
Hmmmmm... maybe? ü§ó
---
Oh okay i understand now op dyna

My dude how long did that take you?
