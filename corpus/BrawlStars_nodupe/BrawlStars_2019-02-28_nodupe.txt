-12 trophies
---
---
---
It is the most luck depented out of all 3vs3 modes. It is the longest. You can have aadvantage by losing, because you keep your scraps... it's obviously objective but I think that this mode needs some improvements

How do you get her?
---
here i'll give you an upvote
---
Haunt fits, it probably was intended
---
The best part of this map is playing as Shelly and Supering someone immediately after they get launched off of the launch pad. With that kill, I get my Super again and do it over and over
---
I hate to go back 10 years to best describe Siege. Gayyyyyyyyyyy
---
I think they give you a couple of seconds and if you are still alive, then the bolt you collected automatically goes to your base.

yup

There is a new brawler lol

Its so fucking horrible. I will make it my mission to hunt down all these skins with my hat Mortis!
---
I didn’t hear about him getting a voice and I opened up his info and had a panic fueled laughing fit.
---
Shush
---
That's pretty accurate
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Nobody likes modifiers. Only life leech had a good amount of fans and was the only one that did somethin against teaming and well.... hm I guess from today instead of 60% showdown is now 70% luck...
---
Uninstall the game and reinstall it. That's how I fixed the problem
---
Not trying to be rude, but what's the strategy..? Am I missing something? 
---
That's karma, yeet
---
I know the map is called Spring Trap, but why aren’t people calling the actual trap a push trap from Clash’s builder base?
---
It was a good idea but poorly executed
---
Nice 
---
Even worse than Mortis without a hat
---
The skin is pretty “meme” just that chin it kinda irks me
---
I was beautiful...
---
That's what I'm talking about... "Exclusive"...
---
It shouldn't be exclusive, there's no point. Just to make harder for each of these plataform users to get each others skins?
---
And if you think it's that easy to iOS users to get Android skin and vice-versa, then what's the point of making it exclusive instead of just... giving both skins for everyone? See? No point in doing it, waste of time. 
---
Supercell: What if we combine our games together? Fans would like that!
---
Fans: Wow, that seems so cool!
---
Supercell: *Has Night Witch Mortis exist*
---
Fans: Nevermind
---
He’s literally a “toxic assassin” and that’s how you’re supposed to play him. If you want control you should pick up barley or Jessie or something
---
It was beautiful 
---
It's good when you have no gems, because you can just jump in there then use your Shelly super for 3 consecutive times.
---
1d8h
---
More like $39.99
---
Sounds like something night witch mortis would say.
---
check buShes!! it's your entire fault you never even check bushes. shelley and bull are meant to be shotgunners. Shotgunners. close range. learn how to counter them.
---
To be honest, it should maybe be a ticketed event, giving tokens, not trophies
---
Look, I don't have Crow so I don't know if he is really that bad or if he is actually good.
---
F
---
You have to have Mortis to even get the offer for this skin. When popcorn Rico came out I had the deal on my main with all brawlers except 2 legendarys and gene, but not on my mini account with no super rares 
---
I believe showdown now stays in one box, even with the mods. Heist and Bounty share a box, and now Brawl Ball and Siege share one.
---
You mean, the night demon... I still have nightmares yo 
---
Yeah that makes sense actually. Good point. 
---
This is fake he had 15 gems.
---
Also can I just say hoe op this makes barley.
---
Your finger or your leg or your the middle?
---
let's take it down 12 notches or so
---
The link doesn't work fyi
---
Is this a troll? Where are the rules?
---
Perhaps he's a lot more viable at top levels of play, but for 90% he's hands down the worst brawler in the game. 
---
true...
---
They had better options like fire spirit spike or mega knight el primo, but no, make Mortis look like a trap. I’m not called that beast Mortis anymore, it’s new name is Morgay.
---
Ew she looks nso ugly
---
Yes pretty accurate, but with 3v3s and dumb random teammates who jump in the enemy spawn with 20 gems
---

---
yeah a loss on this is more tham a 10th on showdown
---
10th on showdown should be the ultimate shame
---
Not out yet, but yet, it shouldn't since it is a disgrace
---
WAAAAAAAH!
---
How did you got 3 of the same brawlers?
---
Wait 1d 8h 
---
Sure, they might be from a different universe. But that won’t stop the wizard from sending other things from his world to Brawl Town, just like his robe
---
Lmao her neck. Or his.
---
Kk
---
Gene in this mode is stupid. Never won Fa a gene in this mode.
---
Although its very minuscule amount of space but he is getting "more vision" through there 
---
It should be one bar with 3 bar length
---
🍰🍰🍰🍰🎂day!
---
I'm sorry I do not believe it
---
Laser eyes thanks you 🙏 
---
I can't wait to get him
---
First they nerf him in brawl ball, then they give him the voice of a dweeb, now this shit..
---
Agree!!!! I hate the modifiers !!! 
---
LMAO
---
oh I love it
---
Post stolen from me🙃
---
Why are you acting like this is super impossible to do? Especially at lower level play, people are very predictable with their attacks. If you know Mortis’s charge time, you’ll know when his fourth attack comes up.
---
Usually pretty close
---
Thats why. Meteors target depending on the proximity of players to other players. Or that what it seems
---
I just hate the meteor modifier tbh...
---
Pam,she thicc
---
I’m....I’m sorry.
---
holy shit
---
They should add launch pad that launch people into the middle so there will be less teaming (maybe also including landing knockback and damage)
---
That man wasn’t stopping for anything 
---
i for one actually think its so bad that i like it
---
Nightwitch Mortis? More like
---
Nightmare fuel Mortis
---
Yeah very niche... He needs walls to fight behind to be effective. 
---
People complains that his buff wasn’t enough
---
Yeah he really seems like a good brawler with a nice mechanic. Good luck in your games/openings too :)
---
DO you understand how to use crow.
---
woah that is such good quality how and what app

I'm only going to be buying this if it's limited time. Otherwise I am never going to let my gems get remotely close to that skin. Ever.

I do that and I have her around 430 rn but I get stuffed when a better burst comes around knocking even at both full hp, unless you're hugging each other there are times where the cards are inconsistent and it fractures your total dmg output. Her super already takes so long to build, why not just decrease its radius very slightly and buff her dmg per card? Or rework the cone she shoots. And what's your trophy count for your tara? Shes one of the 11 brawlers I have left to get  to 500.
---
Someone was killed by mortis recently...
---
El Primos homeland
---
It’s not a bug, the shop just shows you offers you haven’t already bought so that you might buy them
---
It’s only Super Rare, don’t.
---
You can get them from boxes?
---
Not even in game and already most hated skin
---
Probably they were just trying to not die and that is why they were going closer to your base to defend the bolt they collected 🤣
---
It’s a trap!
---
They could nerf his super range considering it just got buffed to go through walls. Other than that I don't see anything else happening to him. This is not entirely game breaking as it is not a glitch, so it doesn't need to get patched. 
---
Though I do recommend Gem Grab as pulling their gem carrier to your teammates can really turn the tide. Good luck!
---
Mike performed well for me.
---
Can't believe crow reloads slower than pam

 A lot of u suggest that I should join a good band and that is a good idea. Thank u :).

How’s the music different?

---
This skin makes Mortis look like a crossdresser
---
Rest of the skin is good expect the faxt mortis is a man and men dont wear lipstic
---
Did you just complain about new brawlers. Shut up lmao
---
It's to keep it fair because  they're new deals
---
He became BR
---
my friend thats never played brawl stars was scared after hearing #”I AM A CREATURE OF THE NIGHT”
---
I love this game and love the devs. They work very hard and you can tell they're passionate on this game.  
---
What surprised me if the sudden update outta nowhere. One day we get some leaks and boom next day we get the update, and that's a thing I love.  
---
However, they really goofed up Night Witch Mortis skin. It really could've been used on someone else Tara or Piper, but it was used on Mortis. Or hell, even a totally different card for another brawler, like musketeer penny!  
---
But it could be improved of course, but it just seems very outta place and the skin really just looks bad. 
---
I used his skin to make an artwork
---
What Is the problem?
---
And supercell gave him your gems lol!
---
Credit the guy 
---
grats, btw did you earn anything like gems?
---
This community has extremely toxic people who do not even think about the work the team has and simply say "I DoNt WaNt iT in tHe gaMe!".
---
Thats the joke
---
I think it’s a good monent for the ‘Upgrade, fuck go back’ meme
---
I couldn't agree more with you. His voice is so adorable and makes me actually laugh... Love it tbh.  
---
PS: ADAVABDADABAHUEHUE
---
Haha autocorrect is so annoying sometimes. Meant to say mortis 
---
I know LoL 😂
---
Yeah, thats a little op in that mode
---
That actually makes a lot of sense. Thanks!
---
But he NEEDS the 12th gem!
---
Bruh 4.5k and tryna flex -_-
---
AS LONG AS YOU HAVE RNG ON UR SIDE 
---
facts, my first ever skin was Lil Helper Penny and is my favorite. hope they do a lot with the skin
---
+Miner 
---
Carl needs an executioner skin
---
What??? No,WTF??? I just talk about Piper cuz... in game... I think... the brawler is a girl maybe??? 
---
You're right. Showdown is just RNG Simulator 2018. Or 2019, with the modifier DLC.
---
He has all the rights to be scared. Lol but seriously gene’s voice is so weird. 
---
LOL BULL AND PRIMO OP
---
Wow. Simple, but great artwork!
---
Mines 20 wow
---
This map is amazing,  i would be so fun to play 
---
Yea, but double trophies was a bad idea 
---
Is this an example of something that works in practice but not in theory?
---
Yea I know, but there’s no reason this should be in, it’s really easy to see 
---
lol.. she's a badass and hottie in cr, she don't wear lipstick it just her lips represent her as a cold hearted witch. and.........  she's a legendary 😍
---
I love the devs and really appreciate all the work they put in, but that skin suuuuucks
---
How racist
---
Antivaxx parents have a child. Three years later: polio scored!
---
Piper is great in duo sd 
---
I love the concept of having to use bouncers.
---
Hahahahaha LMAO
---
That looks like more than ten people, also the map is too open, piper would be op and shelly horrible
---
I have played a couple of matches with random and having success with primo. for some reason those guys won't push into the middle lane unless its dyna,bull or another primo
---
WhAm BaM HeRe CoMEs PaM
---
Great question: It got nothing to do with the powercubes that's for sure.
---
No, Skin is great, just needs a little change in the face
---
Can someone quote the supercell response i cant find it
---
Oh my god. I bet the team that lost kinda screamed
---
It is very fun but feels too risky. Also with the random spawns and already random teammates the wins/losses feel like result of chance. I am thinking of never touching this and skipping the stars. 
---
I think they should tune this down to normal trophies, I don't get why it would have to be double. Those who like the mode will still play it, time is not much of an issue here. I guess the devs think that people play this game with a trophy per second mindset lol...
---
Just don’t encourage them to make more shitty skins please 
---
i think its because you cant handle the shelly style
---
At this  point, this can be considered bullying, I mean how many great skin ideas have been post in this subreddit, and they choose that? seriously?
---
The hood should have black buttons for Sonics eyes
---
Remove the legs
---
GENE is C tier? WHAT? He can pull the enemy’s siege robot all the way back to the perimeter of the circle giving the whole team another 3-5 seconds to deal with it before it gets close again.
---
What. Just happened.
---
most likley 
---
Hes joking with ya. Or she...
---
I just got star player with Frank. Try to take a bolt from Frank. Or get a bolt with Frank standing there ready to super.

Or you could also pull enemies to your base so that the turrent takes them out

---
thanks i was trying something different. glad it came out lookin good!
---
If they gave him a voice I would want him to sound like Rick for Portal 2 (he’s the green adventure core) but a little deeper and of course with the robotic filter all the robots have
---
And put on a ghost skirt. 
---
Saw? while we are thinking of ways to make Skin better, there are people on this Reddit who just complain and dont help
---
This is very good my highest is 22 with darryl
---
Hmm, what? I see nothing wrong
---
ew its face is sharp and pointy
---
I think you might be overlooking Bo - the mines slow down the big bots, are helpful to thrown on the chest and do damage across clustered players / chest, and distance shooting is key against a fighting bot to avoid damage. I’ve had a lot of success. 
---
i hope they change that, its straight up confusing 
---
Yes that is true, but consider this. Would you want to negate the damage of one enemy brawler or the damage of a robot boss?
---
Wow
---
They added the ability to change the way your brawlers are organized. See the top right corner.
---
I think they are trying to make skins like fortnite adding humour into it maybe its on purpose!
---
Tbh, Only the long chin is the problem imo other than that, its a good skin
---
This is magnificent!
---
Robot boss
---
nope, 2nd
---
Oh no
---
Playing with randoms on this mode is somewhat impossible, the only time I won was with friends 
---
It's not terrible it's just not what people wanted. 
---
I would love a report button but i almost never see someone using it as they should be in games

oof I don't have gene but that sound really fun!

This happened to me last night, but with a Brock. The one standing near the gem hole was a Shelly. Was totally pissed off. Good thing I had a super ready for Ricochet. Surprisingly, Rico is a beast in this map.
---
I only got pam to 500 in showdown, otherwise I play it for the star token, I'm obviously f2p

agreed

Then play 3vs3.

If you think that's too old to do, then you're too new to Reddit ;)

The trophy is directly on the plus sign. Thats what he means

Make bolt drops less random, reduce number of bolts that the team who doesn’t get the robot keeps, and reduce the trophies back to normal. That would be best in my opinion

Use them for token doublers or on the golden chests when they are on sale for 49 gems. The 60 gem deal isn’t as bad but it’s best to just save all your gems for the 49 deal. I do it every time.

Still lost the game tho

What do you mean poorly made?
---
It's the best and most fun gamemode so far.
---
You must be mistaken you're worth any questions. You're salty. Teamers don't change anything. Get good. And if you're so upset then just do it yourself or get better enough lol. 
---
This is ridiculous. They should change it to normal losses ASAP and or refund players for the trophies they lost.
---
You should need also an executioner
---
I think he needs a nerd but not a huge one, maybe like less health or slightly slower attack.
---
I am normally against spinning too, but this time it did feel REEEALLY good 😂😂
---
So your homophobic 
---
[removed]
---
Why are randoms so dumb? 
---
It just makes more sense cuz he spins w the super ya know
---
This is true and all, unless you slap the shit out the other team and they collect 3 cogs all game.
---
Same here, I'm confused 
---
Trophy win/losses are equal until after 500. Near and at 500, its +10/-10.
---
Similarly, showdown is +7,+6,+4,+2,+1,-1,-2,-4,-6,-7
---
The stopped movement speed when attacking makes up for the good super

I think you have never seen the lightning skin for tracer in overwatch 
---
He's the first...
---
I got +482 one day 😂 got 3 brawlers to rank 20
---
Ya its called "GET A BETTER WIFI AND STOP COMPLAINING"
---
Down it
---
lol
---
gene got a voice before tara, wtf
---
Well maybe its also possible to make a 7v7 out of it. Potential is def. Here
---
*done
---
I don't see how that makes it homophobic,It just makes more sense since Carl spins 
---
Same percentage doesn't mean shit. Show us the hp of cannons or the screenshot that says draw.
---
The thing is that they earn over 800 millions of profits on a yarly basis, effort is just not enough.
---
As you said, u/GEDI-KOR did a much better job, and he is just a player like you or me. I don't really care so much cause I dont own skins, but I am sure that they could do a lot better, specially when they are expecting revenues
---
No, it's not wifi. I can sit in front of my router with 5 bars and it will still happen (5gb/s)
---
How do u guys get brawler in your names?
---
Lol ur bad
---
Map is actually pretty good 
---
Ahh i hate that stupid cannon
---
Report what? We can't talk. All attributes are created by them and legal. I can't think of anything they have said is against the rules that players can exploit, therefore there is nothing to report.
---
But it’s my name
---
Suffer from success

Leon is so bad now. RIP. My deep condolences. 
---
Just for fun
---
I pushed up to 7,800 trophies without getting any legendary then I got crow from a normal box 3 days later I got Leon from a normal box so my legendary chance is struggling rn😂
---
As a native Korean(even tho I play the game in English because of this reason), I agree with you 100프로.
---
Crow is already quite strong right now. Literally the best brawler at showdown, tied with darryl. I think it is a niche brawler that can 1v1 almost any brawler and win with high consistently. But in a team, he gets neutralised by pam's turret, gene's star power, and poco's heal/starpower heal. But in a showdown, he has got almost no weakness
---
I believe you hold on to the ball, and you can’t shoot until the boomerang returns
---
Same. My teammate mike sucked for more than 1 occasions. But then i encountered someone running mike at 500+ and he wrecked the opposition somehow. Idk what happened, he was freakin 2v1ing the enemy team..WE WON 10. The next game, the same guy was my opponent..and wrecked my team..became star player again and WE LOSE 10. *long time since i found a worthy RANDOM*
---
That is super impressive wow!
---
Also, can I use this stunning screenshot for an article on my blog? Will mention your name as the credits for sure!
---
Like CanYaDigIt says, "Git Gud".
---
Or u/OwenReds
---
I would spend all my gems on this
---
Once you play a few game on this map you get the timing and the position of where people can be, if you don't see all 3 mid they are in the grass.

There we have the update for clash royale birthday we do not need a night witch skin
---
Nothing. He is a CREATURE OF THE NIGHT!
---
That’s not a tilt that’s a damn robbery of your trophies 
---
Same XD from 6k to 5920 
---
Inspired by Rupaul's Drag Race All Stars 4 Episode 4 Runway.
---
Or bull
---
Omg, this is so much better. 10/10 would buy.
---
I pushed 7 k without mythical or legendary now I feel very bored... I don't have much expectation now I have given up 
---
So that people like you can get stuck and die lol
---
This remind me of Ryze ult in league. If they had dynamike/frank it woulda been oof 
---
Thaaank youu
---
Ofc you should! 
---
Rockabilly mortis must have made for me..he is.. 🌟👌👀
---
Even I am at 4k trophies......let's team up.....
---
Yeah and it's also known as "I've had the same wifi for months and it started lagging just now"
---
Omg imagine supering as darryl and being able to roll around the entire lake
---
What do you think of Frank in this mode? Just wondering since he's the only brawler I want to play atm xd
---
At 8000 we loose 10 feels so bad
---
Why? I think both of those Skins are really nice
---
Honestly the look of how bad this skin looks makes me want it more then any other
---
Mortis is useless if there are no dynamikes around and he will likely just backstab you once your health is low. 
---
Here's the image of what I have rn https://imgur.com/a/HoQcRzR They don't seem high at all. Next time I open a chest I will see how much the %s change tho. Just to make sure this updates correctly.
---
Insta-unlock on Carl would be better, no?
---
Since it’s 2/100 for every small box, I don’t really think buying star power is worth with gems
---
Damn, I'm so dumb
---
Darude sandstorm
---
Vizir Gene
---
lmao
---
that's what i have been wanting
---
Why is there that jessie badge in front of your name..??
---
And how can I get that.??
---
*surprised pike*
---
How can I get that mortis badge..??
---
Np.:p
---
It’s luck based just like every game that has loot boxes. So stop crying, some people are lucky and other aren’t. It’s that easy.
---
Tbh Rockabilly isn’t bad either.
---
I should end it should I.. end it all now lmao 
---
Cool ! I want to see that in - game ! 👍
---
How can I get that crow badge.??
---
what do you meean?
---
Yes it's not worth it
---
XD
---
Whole community hates the skin
---
Oh no idea how that makes sense but thanks for the clarification.
---
Wait what, they are supposed to change, as mine have done, but they are exactly the same as mine, and I have gotten an epic so that can't be right, I have 1900 trophies roundabout. 
---
I ain't buying that shit.  I have rockabilly and it is enough 
---
They may just be really stingy with their "luck system" 
---
A million times better than Nightwitch Mortis
---
Yeah this idea is actually great
---
Really dumb idea 
---
How bout  Barley and Mike and call them spinning buddies 
---
How can you play him? 
---
I guess u dont have any brawlers at higher trophy range. Its a fact that you lose more than u gain at high trophies. Even in other modes like gg, bounty n hiest I've lost 6 and gained 3. *perks of being at high trophy level*
---
AHHAHAHA no lmao but that’s a banger it’s Paris by suicide boys 
---
What happened?
---
That’s me last night 
---
Exactly 😂
---
I see that Mortis badge in front of everyone's name, How can I get that?
---
Removed. Rule 3. No providing information on how to break Supercell Terms of Service.
---
Even if it’s a stranger, it’s better to play with them and plan your game than play with a stranger not knowing what brawler their using or strategy 
---
*To be continued plays*
---
Yeah it’s nice but totally doesn’t worth it.. 
---
Siege is exactly Gem Grab and Heist Fusion
---
100 times better than night witch mortis
---
Trueee...that skin is Trans man
---
I unlocked him today! Somehow Darryl still fucking eludes me, I've got all the epics and mortis and at 3500 but no Darryl. I got a star power poco ffs
---
Ye I almost used SS. I barely used brawl ball and carried some games, and scummed some games.( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Fffffffffffff
---
On Monday, I had 6444, then I've been stuck these past few days between 6380 and 6410. It got worse yesterday because of Siege Mode, where I lost too many trohies (currently at 6365). I'll think twice before trying that more again
---
Like how piper chooses in her super, kinda like that
---
This actually made me laugh so hard
---
Nice find! The only mythic I have is Tara she’s great and I heard gene is OP
---
I just unlocked my first above super rare this week i was at 2600 approx i feel you man i was getting really frustrated about it too
---
There are 2 lots
---
Some brawlers are terrible in some maps, that's already a fact.
---
...for a piece of your soul 👻
---
But WHY!???
---
how do you get the spring traps?
---
They were definitely bots. Their movement was really sketchy and synchronized, and no one at 300 trophies is that stupid. Probably for boosting accounts
---
Yea my lucks been pretty bad too! My highest rarity was frank and after i saved up gems (ftp) i opened 3 mega boxes and nothing. And then before i go to bed open a free brawl box and get gene. Taras really good in gem grab and brawl ball i think, genes pretty good overall but yea! Finally some good luck
---
You can 1v1 some brawlers but the you need to be really skilled, maybe a little damage buff would be fine
---
Imo nothing. It's just that before the voice acting most people thought he'd sound like something else but it's not bad. 
---
Its actually a cool ingame model but they couldve made the splash art better
---
Good news, boys! The support answered and I got 500 gems as a donation. I suggest you talk to the support if you haven’t done so already!
---
Map looks nice, really makes me wish we had more terrain options (as usual). Some trees would be awesome here.
---
That’s still a fantastic find though! My luck isn’t so bad I got Tara 2 days after starting 😆 but I’ve got 6 more to get including bo, but I haven’t unlocked a new brawler since pam 
---
*You ssstay out of thisss!*
---
share that replay :D
---
also F
---
Hotwings i know you ive played with you before or have you as a friend!
---
skin plz
---
I don’t understand though how you “save” your bolts cause isn’t it whoever has the most bolt summons the robot you can’t choose when to summon it 
---
tf
---
Transgender
---
I feel like el primo has been waiting for this moment for his entire life. 
---
Very nice map bro 🙂
---
They also insulted Mortis, no worth
---
Exactly I don't understand it either but it happened. Like my team had more bolts than the opponent but they got to summon the robot instead. Super weird I swear but it resulted in us having a super OP robot at the final siege so it worked out
---
What's wrong with them, why are they thinking about doing a disturbing skin for mortis and not about doing a Bo remodel? 
---
Shelly lv7 with the 10th place? Not sure it's a normal Showdown :)
---
Finally now I don't have to keep calling the FBI every time she's here
---
This same thing happened to me when I had 15 brawlers. Some people don't know but brawl stars can be brutal when it comes to drops. 
---
ELL JEEEEEEESSSSSSSIEEEEEEEEEE
---
You just want to have a way to prove to yourself that it wasn't you who ruined the game for your team, do you?
---
I NEED THIS. I WOULD PAY FOR THIS. ALLOT
---
The real Island Invasion
---
I don't understand it
---
Um, no. I don’t want to lose 4 trophies when our piper and brock spends the entire game jumping on the spring.
---
*WE need this.
---
Now please adjust your flair to the appropriate creature of the night
---
The middle bushes near the gem pit confuse me 
---
This has always been a thing 
---
Edited because that was such a nub mistake! 
---
Yeah Super Cell usually adds nicer, more varied things instead of those ugly placeholders. 
---
No 
---
Repost
---
Damn just call them out 
---
I hate the modifiers in showdown. They better not be a permanent thing 
---
Allows for real 1v1s and keeps you from getting third-partied well at least you’ll be able to see who’s trying to come for you. *DISCLAIMER: LEONS DO NOT COUNT*
---
it came in jan update....!!
---
Do not undermine yourself, your artwork is great you should stand up for yourself. 
---
If we look at what they made it’s like it’s straight out of a Frankenstein movie and yours actually makes sense. 
---
I lost 2 in a row then proceeded to regain them back in other modes, then back to siege won 1 then ditched it, I’m sorry but losing 10 is just too high of a price 
---
This probably needs a mini ED-209 from the robocop movie as turret
---
Im a gene main since i unlocked him, his auto aim is decent also for his super but once you get used to aiming your shots with him including the super you really dont want to go back to auto. He is a very decent brawler with very decent stats and a very versatile skill set. Manually aiming is just so much better!
---
On se munkin mielestä hieno, sen lapio ja hyökkäysanimaatio erityisesti. Mä ainakin ostaisin jos mulla olis Mortis. Kyllä sen naama näyttää vähän vanhalta mummolta, se on vähän outo lol.
---
Pääsyy vihaan taitaa olla se että siltä puuttuu hattu. 
---
pickle chin ah boy
---
Go to play store and update your game 
---
Apologies, thanks for clarifying 
---
Don't give them any ideas. Inb4 brawl stars challenge accepted...
---
Also his super misses often, when you auto that will be much more frequent!
---
No
---
Unfortunately, this problem has only occurred since the update which I have done
---
#WE KNOW WHERE YOU LIVE
---
Yes!
---
when you think supercell has an original idea but its just 2 characters from previous games
---
Same...
---
u/SpiralzzHeoo
---
/r/Lootstars no one cares here
---
damn the amount of reeeee of this skin is annoying, just don’t buy it if you don’t like funny skins 
---
"Showdown moved exclusively to the 2nd slot, **some of the maps have active modifiers**"
---
 It is not all the maps it contains.
---
Great game but stupid developers
---
In my opinion, Mortis’ face is a little too dark . Otherwise these skins look fabulous 
---
Skilled, but I dig J the most and can’t see her going out like that. 
---
If i save boxes from now until carl gets released i have got at least 99.6% chance to get him. I can't wait to try him
---
U should be happy u got 10       
---
Just -10 trophies 4 times in a row 
---
Quite the opposite actually. Everyone will form a mob just to burn you at the stake. 
---
I don’t think the OP actually pronounces it with an R
---
hot maze was cancer
---
I got my first brawler over super rare when i had 2500 trophies and there are people who have waited longer.
---
He has 2 eyes combined into 1
---
So yes but you are not hogh in trophies
---
He definitly is bad now. I'm sad.
---
For people asking I'm guessing cuz of his spread?
---
Just replace the water with walls or something, water in bb sucks
---
Great map! I also tried making a map similar to this but yours is just so much better, love it.
---
That's cuz El Primo is muy bueno
---
Im glad. It is just very frustrating having to wait days for a vanilla map to pop up so i can hav fun. I was happy i finally found a game i enjoywd playing and then they murder the fun part (for me) of it. Im just sad :-(
---
Oh really thabk you so much. Can u likr send a ink or somehing to ur map?
---
"Great game but stupid developers", the developers are not stupid, but you, play another gamemode, do not like another? oown... how sad, the exit door is right there.
---
Wait what? We have this in the new update??
---
/r/Lootstars we don’t care
---
Ohhhh I like this!
---
Simple : REMOVING THE SAFE SO BOTS CANT DMG IT

Supercell: adds an ugly mortis skin that nobody asked for.
---
Passionate Artists that have made 100+ awesome skin concepts: **Are we a Joke to you?**
---
Banned for idling but teaming is ok 😂😂 they need to fix it
---
EL PRIMO IS HERE!
---
It's because he's not Top Hat Mortis
---
Oh...i really liked that map :((
---
oh lol idk how I didn't see it
---
Lmao fucking noob 
---
It was hot🔥🔥
---
Therw should be one or two launch pads to get out
---
1380 i think
---
Same I get targeted by meteors all the time and my rank 15 colt got chased to rank 9 by a robot that was like half the map away
---
Let’s go!
---
But when they release bunch of brawlers so people could climb up quickly, this would be a lil too high
---
It didn’t, you can see replays because the Frank, Penny and Rico are above 400. It doesn’t need to be you, just one brawler in the game above 400
---
Does not matter
---
No, it is just because there is a 400+ brawler in the lobby
---
Looks great, would love to play on it gl on getting it ingame 
---
bruh 
---
I believe staff members and big content creators get to try skins like 1 day earlier then everyone else
---
0 iQ enemy
---
I don’t think that it’s possible to get to the islands next to the middle island
---
FBI OPEN UP!
---
Yeah ty. But idk how to 
---
Hope so!!!
---
FBI, OPEN UP!
---
But literally everyone has them....
---
i feel you! :D
---
And el primo
---
They said that shooting the ball doesn't use ammo for him, so I'm assuming that he can still shoot it while his pickaxe is in the air.
---
I havent put the spawn markers. But there is a person whos gonna spawn there tho.
---
The way you built it its the budhist wheel of life! The nazi one is tilted at a 45 degree angle. Still once seen cannot be unseen
---
Dynamike doesnt even have to use his super to get across
---
Ok, thanks for the idea
---
This would be way more disappointing than the mega box it is now because some people already have all the legendaries. Plus, this would only be a one time thing, so once you finally did get a legendary, those odds would reset. 
---
Dude wtf im almost 7k and nothing
---
*sees Crow flair*
---
killmeplz
---
At least they paid attention to reddit
---
It is not cheating but is wrong and dirty.
---
I was also pretty damn surprised too haha.
---

---
Still, teaming isn’t something you can get people banned for, this isn’t Hypixel kid.
---
Have silver
---
Cool
---
She could have a taser :D
---
I think if you reduced the amount of box spawns cause Jesus Christ there’s a ton, it would work
---
Bouncing primo
---
O GOD THE RUSSIANS
---
I got the update, seige still has a few min left
---
I loke it I hope supercell see this. 
---
It would be great to see each people with like 5 or more hahah
---
Black people 
---
Thrower-Mekka
---
Yup and ty
---
I would never hate getting new brawler.
---
NOW HERE!! Is a freaking good idea for reward reworks finally!!!! Kudos OP! Everyone complains (rightly; somewhat) about legendary drop rates and SC tried to avoid that with the “luck system”. Every “reward rework” I’ve seen proposed has had no sense of balance to it and often comes off as either whining or just asking for way too much. It’s a f2p game, quit looking a gift horse in the mouth. 
---
The brawler rarity serves two purposes: 
---
1. It creates artificial ‘lines’ around Brawlers who are for all intents and purposes balanced.
---
2. It keeps players engaged and gives them a reason to spend time in the game outside of the actual gameplay. 
---
Look at any fighting game for example.. you don’t start off with every fighter and often have to beat levels (achieve accomplishments) to get them, and with them comes cooler and harder play styles but is still a character that could be beaten with the ‘starter’ in a multiplayer format. 
---
BS is not much different except that it’s PvP solely and there’s no PvE involved. 
---
Anyways to end my ramblings! 
---
This is a great and simple solution!! I don’t think you should be dropped a legendary just for grinding to a certain point but there should definitely be better incentives and rewards for the players that stick around and really sink some time in! 
---
Wish I could give you more than one arrow! 
---
RRB 
---
I can't wait to unlock a new champ and get demolished by you in gem grab
---
Ok

Can’t Imagine 😰
---
Why did that work
---

---
I did start playing at global release but I’m not a noob. I believe I’m pretty good. 
---
I am at 250 with power level 6. I wonder how he did that🤔
---
All bulls and shelly/ies be like SURPRISE M\*F\*ER
---
What?
---
except the mortis
---
Ahh right so u matched up with them eventhough u didn't press play again? It was not clear from the post. 
---
It’s the new game mode gives you double trophies
---
Removed - Your post is too short, please expand on your title.
---
This isn’t really QOL but I agree
---
It is clear now. Supercell released this skin just for the sake of the memes. Nice meme btw!
---
It is impossible 
---
It would be permanent
---

Magical Words: New mortis skin is worst
---
Press X to Doubt.
---
They hated u/fluffy_furry because he told the truth
---
looks like they are trolling us 
---
N-word
---
Mortis is a he. Regardless of what clothing he decides to wear or what gender he may identify with or his sexual preference. Mortis dressed as Night Witch is obviously a PC move to cater to some of those fans. 
---
Gene is INCREDIBLE dude!
---
Personally, I think Mortis skin will be better if you remove that mask, but leave his eyes black, they are cool.
---
Try to change bat bowtie for skull bowtie.
---
I’m Just Wondering If This Will Be An Unlimited Time?
---
And then shelly uses her super...... Game over
---
Then you’ll have a better chance for the next legendary brawler in the future
---
Shhhhh
---
I can lose trophies 2x faster with randoms now
---
It would of been funny for a April fools joke and they change all the brawlers for a temporary time ,but this just shows, that the community is active with ideas and supercells ignores them. Sensor tower reported 50 million in revenue and some random person on the internet is showing them how it’s done. 😭
---
Remember when bo and mortis were epic rarity?
---
Almost used SS as in never used it? or were you meant to say mostly? 
---
Lvl 35 mafia boss
---
No. Thats whats cool about ir. You can chill on the islands or go to the middle amd wait/ amd kill orthers. Basically the first one to the middle rules  the middle. There are a lot of boxes in the middle.
---
Aaaand I'll never play it again LOL
---
Nita is good on siege.
---
I made the Ghosty Spike ! Check my profile to see my concept of him
---
that would be nice considering mine is currently at 0.000%
---
At least stormy plains is back
---
and all transgenders
---
I Think it's a good idea 🔥
---
Destruction 100
---
Mike is good on siege though...

Mortis, the Mortal!

I’m not talking only about ghosty spike.. and don’t lie

"Say hello to my little handcuffs"

"The law wins!!!"
---
Do you mean permanent as always available in the 4th slot? I think that’s a thing man- it’ll rotate with Brawl Ball just as Heist and Bounty rotate.
---
I have missed it what buff he got?
---
Clash Royale has a similar sorting sorting system its confusing but its not a mistake
---
Actually, you did, but the other one is a thousand times better, and it’s not yours
---
I think Siege could probably replace Gem Grab as the "Official eSport" for BS. It has much potential.
---
Hey I saw you in my game in gem grab playing as penny 
---
I'm not lying... It was also trending in here for a while... Check my profile and you'll find it.
---
Brawl ball is now in 4th slot and we cant play until tomorrow :( 
---
I mean permanent as GemGrab. always aviable
---
I know you have the skills to make this reality /u/pjlorpe
---
fEeL tHe PoWeR oF mUsIc!
---
It’s so bad no one will believe this unless they are trying to be dumb, no offense 
---
Poco goes Coco!
---
Yeah it is..but as you say, a tiny bit. I don't see how that could be an advantage to players with wide screens. It's negligible 
---
Or a metal ball so it retains its circular shape
---
ahh I see
---
I love your nickname

When you play the new game mode xd

Life leech sucks. It's like a pam paradise
---
Grinding 110000 trophies (months and months worth of time) for half a percent increase in finding a brawler? 
---
Might as well throw in 2 gold while you’re at it 
---
That is an awesome concept do you think you could do crow next?
---
The post you stole from is literaly two posts down on hot. make your own memes.
---
What if someone has all brawlers? 
---
A new meme template perhaps!?
---
just as cool as this looks, it’s so unfair/unbalanced and a very small amount of brawlers can win in this map.
---
Hey I also had idea about viking Carl lol guess im not the only oje
---
Did you really had to tell that to me and make me feel extra bad?  
---
You think?
---
I'm going to address only 2 things, so here goes:
---
&gt;I suggest that all bolts spawn on a line in the centre of the map to ensure its fair,
---
Yes. Much needed. Supercell needs to reduce RNG, especially since Siege has eSports potential.
---
&gt;I also think rewards should be back to normal as it really stings to lose a ton of trophies in a 3v3 mode.
---
If I'm not wrong Supercell addressed this already. Since Siege takes a considerable amount of time (compared to other Gamemodes), Siege should have more Trophies earned too. **However**, rewards should be **~1.5χ** the normal Trophies earned.
---
Mandatory Life Leech &gt; Mandatory Meteor Shower
---
Nice
---
they wont. they removed it because its to complicated for a lot of new players and the also have the data, peobably a lot of casual palyerd did not like the mode and it was palyed less than the other modes, so they removed it.
---
Penny and Jessie God tier... I didn't know losses were double because I've not lost yet. Played 15-20 matches too so good trophy gain.  
---
This took them from level 12 to level 15 iirc.
---
Why is mortis is the lowest tier That's bad I got 6 6 6 wins in a row using mortis in seige
---
its not, it just seems a lot since we only know +5 -5,
---
In CR you win lose 30 cups.
---
its all the same, just another scale
---
Pesky leons
---
Everyone will get carl. He's only a super rare brawler.
---
whats the point of the boxes in the water
---
i pushed nota from 440 to 524 with ONLY randoms on Siege, never played with the same team again.
---
try to improve yourself

I know, know. Their terms of service don't allow RE. In all seriousness though I'd love it if we could play offline with bots, play on other servers, have LAN parties, and most importantly use a BT or USB controller
---
at this point the can jsut delete heist in the next update. Siege is way better
---
Someone else pointed that out. So umm it was a missclick. Its not supposed to be there
---
Thank you! I had to do at least one skin for Spike!👍
---
more trophies arent equal to more brawlers

I think they also teased the Bo rework comming in March.. hope you can find anything, maybe there will be new files if we get an maintaince

Delet dis subreddit

r/redditsings ??
---
Good idea lets make the edgiest character even more edgy
---
The unholy amount of bulls en shelly’s on dis map fils me with fear just thinking about it.
---
Yes, so if you get a legendary or 2 in the begining it is the best situation cause only legendary drop rate goes down, for other rarities it stays the same
---
Map name: kevin
---
The longer is see this skin, the more i consider to buy it. i think im not the only one
---
I don't think so, I've had many matches where as soon as the match starts there's a bolt right next to our/the enemies semi-circle. I'm not too sure though

Its really cool how a jump pad makes tanks viable in so many ways :) really good addition
---
My friend supercell say (we make night witch mortis skin for funny and 3rd clash royal birthday) 
---
EL NITOOOO
---
Omg imange his super throwing a pineaple😍
---
Well that can't be because you get 8 megaboxes for the first $30
---
yep but that still doesn't change the fact that the middle portion is pointless. If I would defend the tanks I would go behind them in the bush. Still it is a linear engagement with barely any tactics to it. And I don't have many friends who play, so premade teams are rarely an option for me.
---
To be clear, I am not arguing that if you spend time on this you cannot make a strategy with premades and have success in this map. It is just that the map forces you very heavily into certain brawlers (this is not uncommon in heist but this one takes it to the extreme) and one seemingly optimal tactic (if you can call it that) with an outcome that is unsatisfying if you win or lose. It is a badly designed and unfun map, not one which cannot be beaten with the right comp and tactics (I doubt any map is).
---
If I would have an attempt at fixing it I would probably go for 2/3 of the current length of the sidebushes and put 2 wide-ish openings to the cage in the middle, on the sides towards the safe on each side. But that's neither here nor there. In its current form this one sucks compared to any other heist map and I hope we don't see it again.
---
Your not giving much path options, basically everyone's path is predetermined
---
Its been a Month I didnt get brawler ... Is this a Fun at 7000 open 5 mega boxex 50 brawl box 20 big Brawl box... No new brawler.. Bot even drop rate increase.....

---
Gotcha. Yeah I don’t disagree with you. Maybe Someday they will have 5 or 6 game slots instead of 4 to help with that 
---
Why is this nsfw
---
Isn't that the point of any game mode really? You will never have a mode in which every Brawler is good.
---
Nope they are all in my band.

Thank you so much

Enjoy that team diversity while it lasts because the meta will develop.

She can cuff me any day...
---
Great idea, but how would one go to the small islands in the middle? There seems to be no jump pad going up there. Also, this map is very disadvantageous for snipers.
---
How to create these type of maps
---
Meanwhile
---
#Supercell: We made it for fun! You are still paying for it tho!
---
6210 to 5820
---
If on every island there are two launch pands for different directions it would be better imo
---
More gameslots are fun. there is one main reason why we dont have so much and probably wont have:
---
if you have more gamemodes at a time, you divide the whole playerbase into more different lobbys. the result is longer queue times, especially in high ladder
---

---
Vegetoid is cool dude :(

I have no idea how it gonna use super but i love it anyway

You should be able to jump any island tho.
---
:D

.. the most players are causal noobs.
---
i had people in my club with 9K cups, they dont even knew what brawl talk is and what supercell id is.
---
You forget that crow has the fastest walking speed, and one of the fastest unload speed. Technicaly crow can unload 3 of his shots faster then (I guess) every long range brawler. He needs that reload speed. You also forgeting that the shots 3 bullets, not 1
---
Just got Penny from a brawl box.Guess I'll try this.
---
500-200?

Oh shit

Contact them again?

Or some guy with 2 devices and 2 accounts..
---
Rico is great.
---
yes. Also. the tip of the bush in the center top and bottom is useless. if you stand there the cannon can still shoot you
---
You're joking 😂 
---
It would be soooooo cool if the light on top of the turret flashed when it was shooting at an enemy 
---
For gods sake, pyramids cant roll
---
it will cost 150 Gems, confirmed
---
What's life Leach
---
I'm at under 1500 trophies and have only got 2 brawlers from a box. Pick and Leon hehe
---
I persume it means the damage works like inferno tower
---
NOW WE ARE TALKING
---
I have an advice for you. Just don't play with randoms 
---
Hi everyone
---
I have actually all my brawlers at power 9-10, for the ones who are not at this point you have to know that then you start collecting a lot of coins but you cant spend them correctly, the shop rotations works randomly as the support team says and it is very annoying going day by day looking for the star power you look for and never appears, for the last month I was looking for the Dyna-Jump and it didnt come to the shop, i saw several times the other ones and other offers but never the dyna, I think this must work in a rational way and not so random
---
remodel will be in THIS update probably comming in march. It was just a teaser and a joke
---
Yeah its 200-500 then 
---
No it sucks
---
yes. 23 hours to wait.
---
I don't have a Jasper on my list but I feel like I've played with you before
---
Or two people playing together
---
I just got Leon and I would get this.
---
0.1 decreased reload increases Crows overall DPS +7%. This is a lot!
---
No, Supercell isn't (we aren't Supercell). We are removing titles that are rude, vulgar and entirely inappropriate for this subreddit. People need to think about what they are posting before they do it.

Only suggestion is to make the top walls two thick aswell, otherwise power 10 dynamikes will be very strong.

If he unload 3 shoot he doesn't get any value to the poison part of the dmg. Also he shoots 3 dagger but you can only he all 3 if you are close to the target... being that close also is harder to dodge and Crow has the lowest HP and the low dmg output you will lose a close range fight  if you are at long range crow only hit 1 dagger and his low damage wil bem cut in 3.... he has a fast movemnt speed but that is not enough to him deal with any longrange brawler... it is good agais close range because they can never reach you and you cun run and hit them... however he has so low dmg that sometime you and without room to run and they came close to you and end yoi with 2 hits..  reload speed is not what he needs.. he need dmg....He is a good brawler in showdown but other than that he is not so good in any 3x3 mode
---
I like it but there will be bulls bouncing around everywhere😂
---
But they hve almost the same name and it's so inprobable
---
I’m glad that once you get in the middle you can’t leave 
---
If you get to the midddle first then nope
---
Imagine landing in the water lmaooo

Hllthats the point

Bounty mostly sometimes showdown but on long range maps,,If you get her to level 5 You deal 2k damage and can 3 shot boxes on SD

Hha nice
---
And?
---
Thays the point you cant
---
Lucky....
---
So when they picked their names when they started the game and made the same username on purpose. Supercell doesn't require unique player names so it'd be really easy. Also you were playing duos increasing the likelihood

Whats youtube videos

Hey Supercell! Give this guy a job, because their Skins' Idea are best then yours!!

Congrats bro! I love all your skins' Idea.

You could remake this as the colosseum, it fit perfectly.

Wow I'm dumb I always thought that was his actual nose.

Thank you. I appreciate that the OP likes these skins but he's essentially reposting other people's work.
---
No u 😎
---
I got Shelly as soon as I downloaded the game
---
I think they were trying to make Mortis look like he was cross dressing.
---
Damn they added Donald trump boxes? 
---
 Thank you for the compliment. I believe that everyone has a superpower which called effort. 
---
For anyone seeing this make your account first Then make your map i lost a lot of time and an amazing map that i was making for like a week all because when you go to make an account after your finished you lose the map your working on
---
next week ia CR birhtday, mid of month is Carl, so maybe between CR birthday and Carl or after carl 
---
yo digo que si, seria chido prro :v
---
Yeah I like seeing the good compiled like this but it’d be right to give credit
---
This is the reason imma buy that dude
---
Carl gang!!
---
 It is difficult to tell now. But I can say that I have a japanese traditional general skin. 
---
Interesting idea ！
---
Never gona work. Bulls are too OP
---
What about people like myself with all the brawlers, this wouldn't be a reward for us 
---
Yeah thatd what i thought
---
lmao xD
---
New wave of jumping primos.  Only now, everyone can do it
---
Candy Island
---
Reminds me of that one Undertale puzzle..
---
Even so, if you spawn with quick access to 3-4 boxes, you’re in pretty good shape
---
Yeah. But with duo sd its gooing to be a bloodbath
---
Nice map, i like that you can play this with almost any brawler. Hope this one makes it into the game.
---
Rip.  BO IS OP
---
she's getting a remodel for her default skin first. that's what frank tweeted out.
---
oh, thank you. you almost be my follower :)
---
Good job, now your profile says it has -12 karma. Lol
---
yep agreed xD
---
ㅎㅎㅎㅎ 당연히 가능합니다. 저는 한국인 분들이 한국말로 말 걸어주시는게 친근해요 :)
---
Definitely. But those brawlers were too 'strong'. I mean if you play Non long range brawlers you're straight into disadvantage, Still I don't think removing life leech thus, is  the Solution.
---
You deserve it!!
---
Sadly it's true. I'm in East Europe (more precisely Romania) and people aren't that good at mobile games
---
Bro, they are maxed , how are they “defaults”
---
it is equal to all other rotating modes, it does not have a special privilege just cause its new
---
lol I don't know why but this looks fun good job
---
REPOSTING AN IMAGE!
---
Where is credit? 
---
It doesn’t matter that monstrosity will have 0 buys
---
Same situation with cavern churn. I would say throwers are op early game on cavern churn, yet they dont dominate due to the bushes in the middle.
---
Let’s play and we’ll see. 
---
How is bush camping not a thing anymore? I’m running Crow and don’t camp at all but I’m not seeing any less campers now than I have before.
---
My advice is to push all your brawlers as high as you can but find one or two you especially like or play well with and focus on them and get better with them. They’re all so different and favour very different strategies, you need to find what works for you. As above poster said, you don’t want to push trophies too high or you’ll just meet really tough opponents that will destroy you, however you do want to push to unlock brawlers. Nothing stopping you pushing to get a brawler then dropping again to face easier opponents.
---
Which brawler are you currently using?
---
actually thats what i meant xD im not either 10 yo kiddo who sits 24/7 in youtube and watches gaming :D 
---
Are you living under a rock?

Why is this person geting downvoted? They’re fully correct!
---
Nah, not even close.
---
Ya but thats why you shpuld go to the middle as fast as possible so Bulls dont get there forst
---
its a real MOBA gamemode, it will be epsports in BrawlStars
---
They paid him 5000$ to say thes becous sc naw its dosnt works seriously
---
Then you were playng gem crab and both teams just walk on their sides with the same amount of gems :)
---
I never thought of it that way. Thanks for the suggestion!
---
Heist needs some work but it's still a great game mode. What we need is another game slot so the rotations can be faster. But I know that may cause issues in wait time at higher levels
---
Yes and cloun mortis is awsome
---
They are max brawlers what do you mean with "defaults"
---
yeah, lunar years colt one. but no skin for japan.  I am Korean, but I think Japanese skin is also necessary.  because Japan also uses the lunar calendar. T.T

According to Orange Juice, the 0.1 second decrease in reload time contributes to a 7% increase in DPS.
---
Patrick has no nipples 
---
 Thank you for your support. Someday I'll be able to see you on the official video :)
---
Did you just woooshed me ? 
---
Heist is the faster mode for pushing trophies tho
---
he gets an visual rework in march 
---
And I get one brawler every 5 months and no legendaries at 7000 trophies..so unfair!
---
This is so true. If you farm and push past your skill range then you'll have no fun in the game. My skillset rn has my brawlers around the 300 mark and I have no interest in pushing them higher. If it happens as I'm playing and get better then that's cool but it's not fun to push trophies. And tbh there is no reason to, trophy road rewards are trash lol and season rewards aren't much better. 
---
The average age on this sub is less than a Ted Bundy victim, and this is the only comment you are concerned about?
---
I'd buy it if I had Mortis for the memes
---
Post on r/brawlmaps but still pretty cool
---
fun is more important than cups,
---
other modes are to short
---
i made some more maps, it anybody is interested.

Trust me I feel your pain, I definitely don’t want you to think I’m trying to hate on you, keep grinding there are lots of videos on YouTube and Reddit that will help a lot it’s way more fun to grind and know you can hold your own. IMO 
---
We actually need this in the game this skin is so 🔥🔥🔥
---
it will be limited time!
---
I mean yeah but some spawns get to mind faster than others for example the second to the top one on the left vs the top left one. The top left takes 2 jumps while second to top left takes only 1
---
limited time during CLash royale birthday event
---
No, why would they?
---
I will buy just if is limited 
---
welp, didnt know about that. thanks tho!
---
Are you for real?
---
First of all, it’s never ever ever worth it to not gain trophies in the hope of better rewards in the future for those milestones. Season rewards + the fun in progressing.
---
Secondly, you say you’re a beta player, then you should know that when rewards are replaced you can obtain them again. As that has happened before. Also, if you really are a beta player, you’d have a legendary by now, especially if you spent 75$+ on the game. 
---
Ya its a gamble who gets closer
---
it was a joke but i think it's a bit complex to understand
---
Yes, they are way better than we are (also obviously a team, whereas I was solo queue)
---
Yes Comrade
---
Sponge is a glory box
---
You just keep slaying it eh? I like this design for Leon!
---
Uhhh... Actually if I get Rico so my chance of getting a super rare will drop. So I will have a small chance when Carl come out.
---
Wdym with all of them failed? Can I see the maps?
---
Thank you so much &lt;3
---
No problem bro
---
si esta bien, solo que la ulti se podria mejorar para que no este tan op, pero sigue asi, no es de que tengas dinero, sino las ganas que tengas, solo trata de hacer el trabajo presentable, y lo mas importante, subelo a un subreddit que habeln español, por que aqui nadie te va a hacer caso por que nadie habla español.

good job but ACAB

This is a great map, just remove the barrel in the bottom right. It makes a one block gap which isn’t allowed.

bruh if you lose 0.025 for a mythic how much do you lose for a super rare, if you lose any luck at all, just save for like 2 weeks and thats it
---
Are you good with Mortis? if ses then get his. his star power is a huge buff and changes the way you play.
---
Leons is alos good but not as gamechanging as Mortis.
---
But only get mortis if you can play him
---
I rarely buy skins but this one I would most definitely buy
---
Jeez. People are already making Carl skins? I don't mind but *still*.

its for free... back then we didnt get anything.

just be happy you get anything for free

There is no need for you tell me that there is no need for me say there is no need for me to reply to your comment saying there is no need to tell me that there is no need to tell me when there is nothing you need to tell me about no need to tell me, there is no need to tell me.
---
the skin is good, people are only upset a little because he wears makeup and womans clothes.
---
Corner case lmao
---
Great though there is a one block gap at the very top 
---
yeah
---
The reason for them adding it in is to keep players interested in the game. If you didn’t get rewarded, what would the point be of progressing? I’m simply informing them that the cost-benefit ratio is very far off once you reach a certain point and looking to hear what other people say. So you can keep your “self-righteous” comments to yourself if you aren’t going to help promote the discussion.
---
what does mean.
---
Finally someone understands 
---
i hope supercell does a skin concept contest, would love to see this skin in the game

it's so coooool ;v

Bought this pack and an experience level 5 pack, no problem
---
*Petition* to stop this meme
---
No because total trophies are factored in
---
Am I a joke to you
---
I THOUGHT OF THIS YESTERDAY (thank you though,I am horrible at drawing,even if not my idea still really cool)
---
lesson learned ... lol , my first 3 games was with my 240 Barley with randoms... I ended up winning all 3 ... then I learned the Barley isnt good to Siege.
---
Obviously
---
2 is an exception as well for killing an enemy. By passing the ball to the enemy, they’ll 1) need to spend time passing the ball so that they can shoot you back and 2) they’ll have to waste ammo getting rid of the ball 
---
Ik i just nade something. And it did so flipping good. Over 1.8 K. 
---
Ellesar guess who got him?
---
Ok just to make things clear - I heard the word ‘default’ a couple of times from my friends and no skins used to be called ‘default’ in wild west portrait mode (most of you probably don’t know that but the game was basically vertical and skilled), so I figured I would call them defaults instead of just ‘noobs’ or something. 
---
Also no, it’s not a reference to some other game and I am not gay.
---
So please ignore the title and enjoy the damn video thank.

See my other comment
---
Can't say I disagree.

---
that map was teaming pot in the hell so no, im glad its gone. JUST MY OPINION
---
What the fuck did you bring upon this cursed land?
---
Oh my, already skins for carl wow. An idea that would be cool is that when he spins during his super. Water comes out of the boat as an animation and water would just sprinkle out when he spins.
---
Yea see my other comment
---
It's just the same thing the youtubers have to show carl
---
Look at my big comment
---
You are just bad with him. Take this and remove this post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/MortisGang/comments/apouzp/hello\_fellow\_mortises\_a\_friendly\_guide\_to\_you\_all/](https://www.reddit.com/r/MortisGang/comments/apouzp/hello_fellow_mortises_a_friendly_guide_to_you_all/)

Take a look at my comment
---
Oh ok thanks, how do you get it?
---
Hello Irat4k, I hope you have a wonderful day!
---
Paint sai and Photoshop :)

better idea than witch mortis skin
---
I absolutely love the way you draw.
---
next👏meme👏
---
Only one problem: Darryl!!!
---
Good idea,  bit imagine all the campers
---
Same...even gene didn't have this many AFTER A WEEK...and also this good
---
That spawn point is too good considering the corner spawn points 
---
This is amazing! Love it
---
Just look up "BrawlStars carl server" or somerhing like that
---
r/foundthemobileuser
---
Also, *are you sure 'bout that?*
---
Nuts
---
Hot land but the lava is water
---
I like how u also made the icon thingy, really cool skin!
---
I agree with you, but can you please not speak like an Instagram meme caption.
---
hAhA xd R\Whosooh 😂😂😂bruh be get epic game'd 🗿
---
This NEEDS more upvotes!
---
If you lost 50 trophies stop playing for a while, just that simple
---
&gt; Triggered much? Man there is some real sensitivity around here.
---
Man, the irony, eh?
---
ITS ACTUALLY 0.250  
---
0.048 x Rarity(Mythic=5) =0.240
---
I think she should shoot a bunch of tiny meteors. I feel it would fit the skin.
---
I think spikes needs some jiberish voice lines too.
---
All in favor of making Gedi-kor the best skin artist in brawl star history say “I” 
---
LOL 
---
Legendary*
---
*Looks at pam nerf* Meh keep Bo as he is
---
Europe server im from Albania
---
my device has 4GB ram
---
Pekka has two swords when upgraded
---
Gross skin. Remove it. 
---
good boy 
---
Good stuff, would be a nice 30 gem skin since we haven't had any of those in a while,
---
She's ok bellow 500 trophies playing against randoms.
---
She's bad over 500 playing vs an actual team of 3 coordinated people
---
Yes, in Clash of Clans. But we are celebrating Clash Royale's anniversary.
---
Mortis is looking like he wants your soul now.
---
One jump pad missing in one Island at the top, the 3rd from the left to the right. 
---
So nothing in regards to my comment? 
---
Darryl like it.
---
People would just camp until the storm gets to them I feel like it’s just kinda weird
---
I'm a dyna main, and shelly is a good brawler, but not in showdown. She is top tier in heist and brawl ball, but trash in solos.
---
Explain how you have Carl wheezer already?
---
Too true!!
---
You can’t change titles
---
I got Leon and Gene recently
---
Thank you. 
---
Ik i made a remake go check it out
---
Ok 
---
God I wish that were me
---
Stolen credit card or refunded gems.
---
Probably
---
Wooo go Bakersfield. Worst air quality in the nation! Also I think the most syphilis among teenagers. 
---
Doesn’t mean we can’t take a little inspiration from coc and give her two swords
---
Join a club?
---
Sorry , I am quite new to reddit so I don’t fully know how it works 
---
Please guys gave me a like on this comment
---
Also, she doen't attack with punches. She attacks with her swords, and the movements she does for the attack is too slow to be in the Robo's punch speed.
---
u/Frank_supercell    u/jumpei_supercell 
---
ass heart
---
i know they factor in, but if you play you're least trophied brawlers you go against people with lower trophies on their brawlers too, hence why i'm asking if that happens xd
---
really great!!!
---
Probably.. in the game files, the first Siege map is called “Swedish Siege”. (IKEA is Swedish). 
---
Bo and Bo: WE CAN SEE YOU
---
Well did you do anything in the past? I'm going to venture that Supercell went back and reviewed your entire account history and found some other questionable charge backs. 
---
True but why would anyone do it?
---
No that was the only one they even gave me the exact time that specific charge back happened
---
WHAAT?!? Congrats. 
---
Was worth a shot
---
I have screenshots of it and stuff like that. Screenshots of the map
---
Mechanic:
---
•Has 3200 health
---
•Fires ink filled balloons that pop into 2 blobs of ink on the floor.
---
•Initial Balloon travels a short distance which pops dealing 890 Damage.
---
•Blobs of ink deal 450 damage and damage during 2sec.
---
•Reload time fast.
---
•Star Power Rolls a barrel of ink that explodes and covers a large radius dealing 1045 damage and last 3sec.
---
Username checks out
---
When i created it
---
Looks amazing good job
---
So they can add their own watermark and steal all the credit 
---
Go check my remake
---
Nah i have screenshots abd i have been talking to stefanos i think hes a dev or somethig
---
True, I didn’t consider that!
---
🤣 why credit to the other guy?
---
It still is a good map design though.
---
Come on grab your friend~
---
NerVE ThIS
---
Where can I get a flair? 
---
ELLLLLLL PRIMOOOOOO
---
Why do I not have this update
---
L O N G P U N C H
---
Idk i actually like the skin but it could be a lot better
---
Is frank a girl???
---
Stoop xc *dead*

---
I just got leon and spike from a regular box.
---
Wait sale and save 90 gems
---
30*
---
post it to pew sub before someone repost it
---
They are very good but a little bit to over the top in my opinion.
---
I spent like 40$ and already have leon and spike(from regular boxes lol), none mythic tho. 
---
Totally Agree!
---
Well it’s not in the brawl ball goal but it’s close
---
Increases speed and damage but not health
---
Why almost every map from reddit is bulltopia? 
---
Man do I get so irritated when I see people with 1-2k trophies or even less than 1k trophies have one, two or even all three legendaries... Supercell, make things more fair for your veteran players who have played since day one of the beta launch... Like me and many others.
---
I use one brawler that I never rank up above rank 14 so I can just solely use him for grinding keys and star keys and it's spike
---
Agree completely
---
Getting less brawler pieces. Then you have a higher chance of getting that new brawlers because getting no more colts or spikes from a chest can mean you get stuff that isn’t those brawlers. Thus increasing the other stuff for new brawlers. So if you have 14 brawlers max, you have a really high chance to get a new brawler.
---
Ah but the hardest task is not yet complete. Good luck retrieving the 2 trophies
