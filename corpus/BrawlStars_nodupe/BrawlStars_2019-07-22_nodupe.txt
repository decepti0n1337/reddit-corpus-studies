That's a good idea too

i actuallybuy gold with gems cuz i will never get 80 gems to get a mega box and all my brawl boxes give me 6 coins

Thank you, Kind Morti. I bet we could of been great friends if I was still alive. I always did want peace between our kinds

Why u getting so much opposition cuz ur a dynamike? Fellow Morti I know that it is tempting to assault the power cube but u must learn that we are all equal.
---
Leon is actually pretty useful in Snake Prairie because when a brawler destroys the bushes that lead to the other side, you have to expose yourself in order to get to the other side. If you have Leon's Super ready, you can use it to sneak to the other side without being seen.

And I do approve of such peace. Rest well, ol' friend.

---
You're basically dead after you killed a Jessie because of the damage she delt to you

Every other brawler with such a short range has massive health and fast reload speed, and also does a shitton of damage.

I have 15 open star powers to receive from several different brawls and bao comes star power I'm thinking they must have changed something in the probability because it makes no sense not to go out with all those brawl boxes

You're too my friend. But let's not forget Tara with the same skin color and is very stealthy for a fortuneteller and could be the mother of Leon and teaching him to the best of her ability, to add, Bo and Nita have an actual animal on their heads (as in they killed or found a deceased animal and decided to make clothing out of them) yes Leon has a Chameleon hoodie, but it wasn't made from an animal, it represents an animal, it appears to be a chameleon but its not made from one, its all cotton and wool. But that's my reasoning, so have a nice day!

Dont give me that crap. Please don't. Ive thought about this for a long, LONG time. Whaddya do in life anyways? You live, you waste time, and then you die. Its not if you die, its just a matter of when and why. So why not? No use in prolonging the inevitable. The only reason we as a civilization are afraid of death is because we don't understand it. As a matter of fact, anything society doesn't accept or brand as "normal" is treated like garbage and hated, distrusted. Like me. Since I'm some freakishly tall weirdo, no one wants to get to know me. Ive spent a whole year, a fucking YEAR, trying to talk to people. I used to be the most socially extroverted guy in the room, the life of the party, before my godamn growth spurt. My "friends" abandon or use me, society is predjudiced against me, and no one welcomes me but Death. Death will embrace me with open arms. It will guide me to an everlasting peace that I have sought for a long time. It may seem scary becayse you don't know it yet, but I can understand that isolation. I can resonate with Death, because only it can understand my pain and sympathize with me. And don't give me that "It'll get better" bullshit either. Cause it won't. That's life. Society has warped our minds into thinking death was the problem, when it was, in fact, the answer! Just because we don't know what lies ahead doesn't mean it is bad. It's just different, and its the cowards of society that try and hide that from us in order to prevent us from seeking answers. If nothing else, life is so horrible at this point, that Death can't be any worse.
---
I mean you can take cover or get out of their range (but not out of your range) while also taking care of close quarters combat. It just really meshes well with her main attack and I think that makes it one of the best
---
That's a nice idea...

They‚Äôd be awesome.

Yeah changing it up a bit would be nice such as randomly playing different event themes. Perhaps even an ability for users to change loading screen and customise audio for the background music from past events if they own skins or something from that event etc. idk but the same old stuff is getting kinda boring
---
Lmao it‚Äôs all good, I understood you the first time. The dynamic really was dumb for playing him in that map.

They change the song every thine they have a different theme and when they have no theme it‚Äôs normal music

---
The fact that Shelly is an op star power is beside the point here, what they were saying is that it adds spice to the matches that you should adapt to what star power they have and then try to overcome.
---
It basically works like meteor shower etc.. which changes the match a bit, but there nothing related to RNG about waiting 20 seconds, maybe it‚Äôs unexpected-but mot RNG.

I like to open boxes as soon as I get them, because I have hopes of getting a new brawler.

How is this related to brawl stars

Thanks for the question! The answer is no :) The flowers are technically walls so no attack can pass through. No splash attacks for Penny either although any attack can definitely damage the "wall" :)

Gene and shelly comp: am i a joke to you?

Only 4k trophies but i know how to play against 500+ so im here to help

so

Thank you!
---
By the way you do realize that crow has the most single super damage potential against the heist safe, right? A perfect crow super can cause over 12000 damage (over 25 percent) to the safe. It is hard to achieve in a real fight, though. The enemy will probably stop you from supering on top of their safe.

Also this meme.
---
I forgot to mention that all regular boxes there have been replaced by Big Boxes.
---
Okay, thanks for the free Big Boxes!
---
Yes, it needs more boxes. But that‚Äôs not an issue, you can just toss them in somewhere. I like your spawn points a lot, especially how you can launch straight into middle. And I also like how you used a lot of water around mid, but with good spacing it‚Äôs still not a huge choke point like it is on Thousand Lakes.
---
They should do something like in Fifa Mobile where you could fight with other teams and earn tokens that you could exchange for players, money bla bla. They should do same there but with idk, packs, or points that we can exchange!

To avenge Dynamike?

But still tho

Hmmmm, I understand why your scared, but you got to stay strong. You aren‚Äôt going to let some obstacles get in your way, right? Never give up, young one! There‚Äôs still Rosa, Piper (kinda), And Shelly (kinda) to go for. Jessie is a kid and Pam... made the kid.

Mah it's just 2 star powers and Tara

I can be you friend.

16
---
Exactly!, She's the worst for some people because the orbs are slow ok, she's not designed to insta kill players. You have to predict the player's moves and deal damage that way. Once you get your super it's like you get a second mate to prevent you to be killed, defend an area, heal behind the turret (possible depending of the enemy brawler) etc, she has a lot of possibilities.
---
You say that until you realize that you can only pick one of the two star powers you just got

I found leon and crow in a normal brawl box sooooooo....
---
But you know as a dad i feel so uncomfortable to estrange my bibi if i do that i will be alone.

Yes it's great idea!!!
---
There's a chance of -2% of getting a legendary, if you're lucky your mythics will go away
---
Take my upvote. Just take it.
---
i'm at 8k with 20 brawlers. my wish is to get a mythic brawler.
---
Instructions unclear, Buffed Poco and Nerfed Bibi.
---
The idea isn't broken, the rewards though couldn't be 1000's of star points. It would have to be either very low numbers of them or something else.
---
I will not believe it. If you show me evidence I will simply claim is doctored. It has to be when there‚Äôs less than 0% chance in every brawl box.
---
I found spike and crow in a standard brawl box... in fact all my brawlers and SP I found in a brawl box. Big boxes and megaboxes are the real bad boxes here
---
100/100 would buy this skin if i could do that
---
I know hot to solve this... buy it. This guy will never show again
---
I did think about that, but since crow‚Äôs voice is high pitched and annoying, like a parrot, I just chose a different kind of an high pitched annoying voiced bird
---
Hello, I really love your game and I want to propose an idea. What if when Nita died, and the bear alive Nita will be able to rejoice and also with the turret of Jesse and a penny cannon

I love the comic, (and I get it doesn't have to be completely realistic) but the whole point of canaries is that they would die first if exposed to H2S gas, CH4, CO, etc, due to having a smaller respiratory system  even if there are a bit further away from the source of the gas then the miner. A rock burst would be more appropriate, especially given they were harder to predict before modern technology.

You are right. But it‚Äôs our job as parental figures is to support on what makes our children happy. I‚Äôm going to be honest, when my kids left me it was very bittersweet, knowing they are going to forge their own paths and make a difference on this world, but it did make me feel alone sometimes. But I know that this is how the world is and we have to just do our very best! Also, they never stay away forever, they always comeback to visit because their love for their parental figures never leaves. And Bibi is only 15 while Brock is only 16, they are both not going to get hitched immediately if they see each other once, you got plenty o time to cherish memories with her.

Can't believe they don't have something similar already. The rewards would have to be lower though, they'd never give 10,000 for one season, 100-500 perhaps.
---
There is a wealth of possible modes and ideas out there, it baffles me why SC aren't pushing a lot out there in terms of options. As things are, the game is a little samey. The same modes rotate, the same boring one (Gem) doesn't rotate, we have to wait a week for ticket events, and so on. More survival modes, hell even a single/team mode where we play through some kind of narrative would make things interesting. You could play it through with different brawlers for different results.

The game could also benefit from feats of some kind (such as 'kill x number of Crows' or 'survive for 1/3/5/7 mins in robo'). They'd give small but valid rewards.
---
You spend gems while you can spend them on offers. However, I don't mind it
---
Lol, he‚Äôs going to get mad when he sees this thread
---
Congratulations! You are no longer on fire.
---
Personally I think piper is 17-21 idk though. But this is really well made man!
---
I want keep star poits to buy spike skin... wen I have spike, it will be easier...
---
nice blurring lmao
---
His attack can only go through walls once he has waited several seconds after reaching full ammo, similar to Bibi's knockback mechanic.
---
FBI open up
---
Tbh I dont recognize the map on the right. Is it from before global? Could someone tell me what it's called? Also, Eye of the Storm is definitely one of my least favorite maps *cOugH CoUGh dUne dRIfT*, but I dont think it should be removed. Maybe they could remove another map...   *COUGHAVCOUGH DUNE DRIFT SKSBSKEB*
---
Oh oof im grinding
---
Thicc rico is bad rico
---
Let me main Darryl
---
No, I edited the code to look that i have the skin, only on me. I have 8101 star points and im 8550 trophies.I cant have the skin, its 50000 star points
---
Im still grinding man. I have 7200 trophies.
---
That map is called hot maze it was removed in January I think. That map was full of dynamikes and barleys but it was a fun way to push mortis
---
wait.... SHIT
---
K :))
---
All the comments saying repost but the upvotes have spoken. Get mad. (Downvote if it makes you feel better, couldn‚Äôt care less)
---
This isn't really very skill based, it's very lucky
---
ok

# 100 GEMS?!
---
Unless you timed your death which I am skeptical of
---
Fata
---
Absolutely not. Keep hot maze where it is. But remove eye of the storm too. They both suck. Horribly.
---
I hope yours is awesome too!üòäüî•
---
With the addition of Tick, that map would be so much more broken üòÇüòÇüòÇ. There would be like 5 Tick heads just running around the maze.

Yeah, but a little bit of dodging too

Hello INNURIA
---
Very true !
---
Yea, but I also seen that on Twitter some guy asked Frank: ‚ÄúI wonder when we will ever get a LGBTQ character in brawl stars!‚Äù. Frank said ‚ÄúWho said we haven‚Äôt?‚Äù This means that there is a confirmed Brawler who is somewhere in the LGBTQ spectrum! That‚Äôs really cool!
---
Bro can u just stfu ur justa noob and a little kid
---
You need help convincing him? I'm in.
---
What the actual fuck?
---
i cant tell if its supposed to be sharingan or just regular shuriken but either way, true asf
---
Does it have to be online art. Can you print it out, color it, and take a picture of it
---
The enemy is team Mehmetcan emrepro and emre turkish names :D
---
jesus christ i was playing with a piper that did exactly like this in showdown
---
No tnx i want to do it by myself. But tell me his weakness
---
She has 2 years, the game was launched in 2017 and she was there, and recently it was her birthday
---
Please explain.
---
This is good. But I feel they need to nerf it a little.
---
Personally I think unless you really want it bad, wait until they add more skins or items to the shop. There may be stuff you like better.
---
Okay so they made crow phoenix: fire 
---
                                     Mecha crow:Electricity
---
Alright now we need like a duck crow and a tree crow or something like brawlstars makes me feel im playing pokemon go
---
I wish for a new brawler *cries cos no brawler for two months*
---
I like ur name
---
So basically i owned turkish players
---
Screw r/mortisgang, but not Mortis himself.
---
Use your super to destroy the bushes and even damage him in the process. Without them he cannot do anything. Anyways that's all I have. I gotta fly back because my leader called for a meeting. Have a good day(or night) Brock. Also good luck :)
---
Now mortiss shovel won't work
---
Yeah, I liked the tweet but not the comments. A lot of people were against lgbt which is understandable to me because theyre kids so they either dont realize they should at least be neutral or theyre actually just homophobic.
---
I was explaing this and why this is important to see a company doing something for lgbt month (last month) and ACTUALLY doing it for the people and not as an obvious marketing scheme
---
Amazing! And his super could be like the Inkstrike from Splatoon!
---
That‚Äôs why I hate them, the maps to me are not balanced for all types
---
wucky my teamates see dat i died and go sicko mode on aww 4 teams at once uwu  
---
oof
---
Tnx man. And show leon and spike who boss is
---
One of the best ones
---
Heh thanks. I got like 4 accounts with dumb names like that
---
Next goal is 300!!!!
---
Idk... both?
---
Can you do more than one?
---
i was tired of seeing this memes about leon with no voice, but this does put a smile on my face
---
Gg but I got 6 brawlers form a mega box
---
So... they said this just for marketing? Also I‚Äôm completely fine with LGBTQ people (I have many LGBTQ friends), I do have ships for the Brawlers that are LGBTQ but they are not as strong as my Straight ships (since I have a Straight mindset but respect and support LGBTQ stuff)

Oh crap
---
Watching the vultures all get killed was nice, well done. Hate it when you're not on full health and two brawlers decide 'oh let's gank!' and ignore each other to come after you.
---
I just saw that image rn. Lmao I didn't trace it my friend requested it in that position and he sketched it on paper so I could do it for him.
---
I like the idea of club leagues, it would be so cool to have something everyone in the club can work towards. Though I'm not big on star points as a reward
---
It is way too easy to get cornered on Dune Drift imo, on Eye of the Storm however, with some epic dodging, you can escape. Dune Drift gets you in these little corners which makes sniping to finish on Dune Drift super easy. Because everyone uses Piper. Whenever I see Dune Drift it's "ah sh*t, here we go again."
---
The trophies aren't balanced and the enemy team had a player that was near the start of trophy road.
---
Haha I think I've had a game with this player, seen that pop up on my screen before too.
---
I think it would make the game even more pay to win because you can buy coins in the shop
---
Your weird, the eyes are outlined exactly like the one in the other picture, and as well as other shadings.
---
Fun fact : This is true.
---
can't wait for this!
---
Oh cool, that would be nice, be fun:)
---
Good idea but you should change the design like adding some skull thing on her clothes so that her super doesn‚Äôt seem random
---
Crow
---
We need #givedarrlfukingvoice. Like seriously a robot pirate will do

It's a weak copy of Pam's Super actually üòÄüòÄ

no...you are the food

More like how not to play poco shelly or nita. They coulda backfooted a bit killed the tick instantly and went with their lives but they decided to just run in a straight line back

I love the design but I have a hard time getting a "Warrior" vibe from that.

Yes ^^^^^

Post it on your profile and show me.

So true, new siege is awful but at least you don't get -6 for losing.
---
I dont care what you say....SERENADE POCO IS MY JAM
---
Piper is actually just a good looking 50 year old
---
If the skeleton are golden it works but if skeleton are real skeleton you could maybe change the golden skulls for more white/grey skulls on her clothes
---
Well idk then.
---
Give me mortis
---
Old enough to send you to jail weirdo
---
A crow with 5% is basically a dead crow he has 2k4 hp, how u can make it go to 5%, shelly recover too much from her super, rosa super is too weak...

Ok

That's one specific instance where the Tick was lucky enough to encounter stupid players. God that brawler is terrible.
---
Welcome to the poco gang my friend

Eye of the storm is legit the best map ever... If you were to remove it.. being passage back... Maze is ight but passage and storm easily overcome it

Yea just in general would be great to see someone like Leon without a skin yet get an awesome new themed one similar to Robo/Mecha stuff, and then a recolor for the star point version would be easy. Crow got 3 versions in this update....
---
Me 2k with only one legendary ‚òπÔ∏è

Ngl she does look like a young teen in this artwork

Well boys we did it, Colt is now Sonic

Thank you so much :)

At least 30 the way piper sounds

Well it ain't her first rodeo

This would be a nice replacement for white crow.

Hot maze needs some minor tweaks, eye of the storm should not be removed, but should get big changes.
---
Same
---
Yeah!
---
Oh well
---
You are weird... did you know that? Cause other people are encouraging me.you can see them here!üôÑ

Yeah. Yikes. I would just delete the whole post at this point.

True

Hasta la vista, baby

Who scored it. Me üòõüòù
---
And I cant get a ticket from mega box...
---
Im not suggesting for players to play solo or not,  just saying all the top players didn't get there alone. 
---
As far as gem grab,  maybe something mode specific could be added,  but personally,  i never have a problem getting kills and damage when I'm the main carrier,  so I don't really see that making someone's ranking drop. 
---
Naturally there would be room for improvement,  and it couldn't hurt... the only trophy system is horrid for trying to determine quality
---
üòÇ I did it
---
Anybody hyped for clock fight!? June map making contest winner map
---
Hopefully they'll add more recolours of other skins in the next update
---
Thicc head, thicc eye, thicc chet, what other thicc do you want?
---
True, but at least it's a half decent skin.
---
It could be based on how many trophies were gained in the season instead of total trophies and maybe be less abusable by top players joining a few bands
---
Yeah on stormy plains too. Angry robo is SO SHIT! They removed life leech and gave us more UNFAIR angry robo...wtf supercell...
---
A Minimum wage job is enough for your gem addiction

You can‚Äôt , you have to wait a while

I agree with you

The new trophy system is great i can finnaly play my brawlers that were at 500 and not have to worry about loosing a shut ton of trophys. It makes the game a lot better

Things that sound strong on paper can be different in execution, his pierce ability is slow but you're focusing on his **Pros,** to balanced out his **Pros** he has his specific **Cons**
---
His **Cons** being his health, slow reload speed and less damage than other sharpshooters.
---
We also have to remember many people can break walls, he can only break a few at a time between shots, and he has to get close without dying. When there's other brawlers like Primo who has a lot of health and then Piper/Dyna can do it somewhat safely with easy escape
---
**I also have a ***challenge*** for you and anyone reading this.** Without looking anything up, you have 30 seconds to think of maps that would make a huge different with this ability to destroy walls. If you cant remember the name just search it up after the 30 seconds and reply
---

It's such an ugly skin lol I'm so tired of seeing it and Outlaw Colt every damn day.
---
Some people dream success

The buying power points is a great idea but what about ‚Äúavailable in brawl boxes‚Äù?
---
I didn't know that
---
this is really good, I always love seeing your artwork!
---
Y'all ever wonder why tf does reddit repost an idea that was reposted on Instagram that was originally made on Reddit....yeah I wonder why...
---
Love it!
---
nah more like royal runway
---
A better way to describe **"single-shot"** would be **"Hit-or-Miss,"** though mostly people won't get it and will assume you're referencing Tik Tok, so choose where you use it
---
&gt;&gt;**An example of using this term would be:**
---
&gt; "Snipers are strong but take forever to reload, it's basically a Hit-or-Miss weapon"
---
#EEEELLLLL BARRYL
---
*FOO*
---
The combination of Darryl‚Äôs above average mobility and DPS makes Darryl the superior brawler.
---
you can just not play this map in showdown, it only takes like a day for it to change...
---
Then for example if you are viewing this comment press your user name and the bottom option should be 'change user flair' press that :)
---
Will do!
---
Oh ok sorry take my upvote then I loved the other versions

i did this before and the controls suck along with the emulator being shady, i envy people who got it down

Can you buy the skin using the star points without having the brawler?
---
legendary power points are just as common as trophy road power points

Suddenly everyone plays bibi and teaming you are the only crow and you don't team what do you do:
---
a) get a super to jump in the middle so bibi's can't touch you 
---
b) try to kill off all of the bibis
---
c) try to get the bibis to kill themselfs
---
The thing is, it‚Äôs way too god damn easy to gain trophies
---
For example, you need a 42% win rate to get to 800, and that‚Äôs just fucking stupid
---
Lets not forget that "ricochet" is a legendary

Most of the tickets were free...The gems were left over from buying the mecha crow skin. I rarely buy skins. I could buy token doublers and tickets but feel like I've got enough and spent enough on those for now...I am waiting with the star points to see what else comes out...You got me on the gold and I am kicking myself for not buying frank's or tara's star power but wasn't sure how good they are..

This is good!

Nice job!
---
I have no clue dude
---
I believe because the map feels more horizontal rather than vertical of the other maps. Make it easy to fight throwers while going to the safe.
---
Dyna jump is actually probably the worst star power if you cant use it with alot of skill
---
Hell yeah
---
It will max out at 99.

The should remove cavern churn

100 new brawlers why not

Ohhh I see ok ok. I don't really assign stats because I just like the design aspect and assigning attacks and supers :) But I do agree with you. If given the wrong amount of stats/range/etc, any brawler can be op

It‚Äôs based on the top player in your party. Supercell doesn‚Äôt care one bit if you are using a 900 trophy brawler and you‚Äôre playing with your friend at 50 trophies, you will he matched against people at 900+

And brock hasnt gotten a skin in awhile. while crow got 3 in one update along with bo. also bo has 4 skins if you count his default

the gap of a barley, crow, bo and brock skin atm is the same until next big update/next event

Fire
---
Im gonna be honest....that looks terrible
---
When he pops up from the ground it makes an effect of dirt or something
---
His hair looks a little detached from his head but this still looks pretty good
---
Actually the invisible sight is his super so that is probably fine, but being able to constantly break through walls is really, really powerful. He can break through some barriers in an entire clip which prevents other brawlers, whose play style really requires them to take cover, to be able to get the positioning that they need. I think the design is pretty cool with his name being pierce and him being able to ‚Äúpierce‚Äù through walls, but I just think that ability may be too powerful
---
Does his primary fire break through or simply pass through barriers?
