Nice post stealing

Wait why are they closing rush wars ?
---
That how it is for me literally I have all the brawlers at under 6k
---
Yes i am
---
shat do you mean?
---
actually I would really prefer it if they changed her name in English to Catrina Piper. "Calavera" is literally just the Spanish word for "skull," whereas Catrina is the name of a traditional skeleton character and getup from the Day of the Dead celebration.

It took me a second to realize that the title was lyrics of that firework song lol

Sorry to hear about your loss. Thankfully you have found a wonderful support network here in brawlstars. PM me if you need to talk. Also that goal was fucking filthy, keep it coming!

If you don't Pick them up, enemies will, where is the logic (I understand what are you saying just pointing that in some cases you should Pick them up :D)
---
Deep
---
Which one?
---
I have one legendary but otherwise same
---
F
---
It really sucks because they have some awesome animations.
---
It's a strategy. Hate to say it, but I occasionally do it too. (Im 17k btw)
---
Boi you traced
---
true, in some cases you do, however most of the time the enemies will be pushed back into their own spawn area so you will have control over most of the map, including the center.
---
haha i mortis haha throwers food haha comedy fucking laugh i beg you!!11 lmao i am comedy genius! that means my joke funny &amp; original haha!!1!1
---
I'm not the right person to help you with this, but good luck!

Qué tiene buenas curvas :v
---
Are u upgrading ur brawlers evenly??? I would recommend u to upgrade one brawler to lvl 9 first then go for a 2nd brawler to lvl9 and so on.
---
If u get offers like star powers in the shop don't buy as u can get free star powers from boxes
---
Not quite right: every time they are happy, there is a Piper, every time they're sad, there's a Primo. I would do it but I do not have that time
---
You know how frank kinda spins when he does his super?
---

---
Just spin with the yellow circle around you to make it look like ur about to attack
---
When? And then why she has a Poco's photo in her phone
---
*insert red wifi symbol here*
---
I mean I personally think backstabbers are basically at the same level as teamers. Teaming requires no skill, but neither does backstabbing. People say they backstab to stop teaming, but often backstabbers make the first spin, and I've never seen a backstabber leave the power cube on the ground after they kill their teammate. Backstabbing depends on teaming, but fuels it at the same time.

is it only for in app purchases?

Ouch.

This is neededddd

Hi spike
---
that's the point
---
Ahhh! So shiny!
---
I never got a chance to try it :(
---
I only team with Mortis cause I just feel bad
---
Frisk?
---
What were the other games SC was trying out?
---
Good mod
---
Nobody chooses a brawler that can destroy blocks except dynamike.
---
The dynamike has dynajump
---
Werewolf Leon
---
In that case I’d love to see that concept added to the game. It would really show what characters dominate in each map/game mode.
---
#laughs in 39 gems
---
Yikes. I dont even have sandy or have even matched against Sandy but that sounds like crazy nerfs
---
All my kills got stolen then I got killed. 😐😑
---
Shit i was about to say that
---
plz post a video how you did this
---
how did you get the 39 gem offer? i haven't seen it, recently at least
---
I don't think this is stolen people, I like it though
---
Lol you gonna fix it?
---
You lucky dog, I knew I should have downloaded it
---
Yop
---
You should have known, there are more skins with better effects, rockabilly mortis is pretty much the worst of the bunch of 150 gem skins.
---
you forgot to add a 1 at the end
---
OOOOF
---
OOF
---
Perfect 👌
---
teaming in takedown is good
---
Reach out on ask Reddit or message me, I'm 16 and I can feel the same a lot.

I got to 600 after grinding like another 30 mins in brawl ball. My highest with mortis is 700. I’m trying to get to 800 this season!
---
I understand you but your just going overboard. What, this is one match up out of the others. Most of them are honestly pretty fair in terms of trophies and levels. Plus, you don't have to hate on the whole company because of one mistake. It's not that they don't know how to do proper matchmaking, simple errors could go wrong, they could be invited to play as a group. This could cause frustration, but don't expect every match up to be so similar

The Ballad of Buster Scruggs. I think the movie is about two years old. If you like comedy and drama skits, you’ll like this movie. Great messages, great laughs, would recommend.

Oh look! A guy who's complaining on other people's posts when they didn't take the credit for it!
---
Whenever that happens I think that they are better than me or I was better than them
---
Soooo... Mortis with a different super... Gotcha.
---
I had this idea in April but Kairos stole it from me but I forgive him:
---
Name: Bricky
---
Health: 4000 \~ 6000
---
Attack: Throws a brick dealing 2000 \~ 3500
---
Super: Builds a 6x1 wall with 8000 \~ 12000 health which him and teammates can go through.
---
Star Power: Anybody who damages his walls will be poisoned for 60 damage per second for 3 seconds (does not overlap)
---
Star Power 2: When Teammates go touch/go through the walls, they will be healed 300 health (They can touch it over and over again to heal).
---
\~ means Power 1 to Power 9.
---
Only way to find out u/RepostSleuthBot

I don't think I've ever heard anything in brawl that has made more sense to me 😂😂

Yeah i know and i hope similar things never happen in BS

Was it a one to one conversion or like how for 80 rush wars gems you would get 40 brawls stars gems
---
yeah you're probably right. Out of curiosity, what are some Frank counters used in higher leagues?
---
Thanks!
---
yes allow us to introduce ourselves memes are back!!!!!
---
Hey, you'll get him soon don't loose hope!
---
That's really cool! I've had Mortis on my main for months now
---
Nice, keep up !
---
Yea...?
---
Mouth is much larger than the body.
---
Does rush wars gems have more, less, or equal value to brawl stars gems?
---
Yea and then you get matched with the worst team in all of Europe.
---
Haha. Lol. Good artwork, too. Upvote from me!!!

Why didn't you gave creddit to GEDI-KOR

---
This is so cool. I especially love the art style
---
Lol this would have been perfect if that one piper in enemy team had default soin instead of the pink skin xD
---
is there a way to send me a link if so please send
---
He is balanced. You just need to play him right
---
Fuck you
---
I think it will be a good night
---
That’s exactly what I stated in my previous comment. Depending on your perspective on teaming, it really wasn’t a problem because, in fact, you were the problem. 
---
Of course the people who did find teaming a problem, and were against it, were the minority, but it was a definitely a big deal as it was big enough for the Supercell team to comment on it.
---
To be fair, reddit is always a small minority of the playerbase, so a lot of the feedback and complaints may not reflect the true thoughts of the all the players; this means, by default, my argument is invalid, but it was a big deal on reddit at least and remained that way till global.
---
Ah yes, Clash Royale. The game that has the most toxic little shits
---
Classic trickshot
---
Crow is op already

See, this guy understands

Thanks for your art post! If you are not the creator of this work, please make sure that you have included the source, or to  comment it here! Unsourced art may be removed if you are not the creator.
---
Damn, this is so beautifully done!
---
PS: coming from an artist myself, I must say a job well done! Especially the background details of mortis shadow and all
---
Now that I thought about it, I think I agree with you,it would make much more improvment to the game and alot of new experience! Looking forward for supercell to do something about it.
---
Hyper bear was not even close to one of the best star powers in the game. Bear with me is nearly always better

This looks amazing!! 🤩

Oh fuck, we got fucking strapoints to buy excellent skins FOR FUCKING FREE. You still beg for more...

So you are thinking that's a skin if it's a brawler huh?

And also wrong flair :D

I did that yesterday but we had a good team but srsly.....so thought this was just me 😂😂😂
---
Ok buddy
---
I don't think one single post may cause the death of the game. I just don't understand how Supercell just don't have a PBE (test) server where some people could try the update and give feedbacks. THey do so much hazardous updates that kill their game, I don't understand why they didn't implemented it yet.
---
Tbh, I would love to see your character’s final design, I’m just getting triggered easily when I see tf2 references, for ex. Overwatch which I can’t stand - it’s unoriginal. I disliked even Brawl Stars until I started playing it, this game’s is fine, because it has a lot of original ideas
---
I would feel so bad 😂
---
This will be so much fun
---
Holy shit that’s an 8 item mega box
---
And then she smiled
---
This is not an evidence. You could be also a bad random with good teammates as well.... But yes, Leon might be good in Heist
---
Happy to play
---
You have good taste
---
That way you WILL eventually run out of tickets.

It’s only on purchased gems

Never celebrate too early 😂
---
Incredible meme template ! Can I made it into a drawing ? I'll credit you.
---
It equals to the amount of money of gems that cost 69 gems in bs

You can only transfer your gems to other supercell games

*as any brawler

This is big Brain time

It gets there when you have Legendaries left

It goes by how much the gems cost in each gane

Wow, just wow. That amazing ! (posted by a random french guy)

---
You're from Romania?
---
No in arabic the name is "PLAY IN ARABIC" just change the laguage of the game
---
Good luck! Is Ricochet maxed?
---
And brawlers on sale. Thats just broken
---
It is ok when it just release,but every update is getting the game more shitter.So...
---
Not blaming,but rush war is darn because of supercell themselves.I play rush war and thought it is not that shit,but I quit and back to brawl stars and clash royal before the random card battle came out
---
Things like this must be fixed
---
Fr tho😂
---
when opponent is inside your super, you heal up some health per second

Obviously Werewolf Leon.

Tara and nita and poco and sandy and frank and barley and tick and dynamike and... Nah I think I said everyone
---
Oooooooo thanks
---
i think 100 is too much it won't pay off knowing my luck
---
make it 50 or 30
---
The artstyle is really unique and aesthetically pleasing!
---
You're good ik sorry for calling you toxic
---
I’m ralated.
---
No, Ricochet is
---
You should blur your email
---
Sounds like a cool idea
---
Crying in 15k with no legendaries..

Me too

---
i taoped on it to check and its 2 dollars for me
---
Well, maybe i misunderstood you... But Leon actually is the most sp addicted brawler now
---
I was about to tag Shinymoon about that than I saw who OP was
---
"Maked"
---
Bitcoin is a virtual currency though, so doesnt make much sense with an ATM.
---
lucky i wish i got leon powerpoints
---
I dont know but i was so exited
---
Work? What work? It’s an idea that is being presented to the community, don’t you want it to be shared? You haven’t done anything to develop and implement it, so what work have you made?
---
spike was confirmed to not have a voice
---

hes a fucking cactus
---
Good bot
---
Nice
---
yep you got star player
---
She was good in siege and showdown too. As well as big game
---
poor little cactus
---
u/repostsleuthbot cmon
---
I think you saw the text wrong, this barley obviously is ricochet, not barley
---
I didn't show the whole replay so you don't know!
---
Yes
---
I hope SuperCell will take this sarcastic map, seriously..
---
There are thousands of player complaint about "Toxic player making own goal"
---
Hope SuperCell will make a solution, how to counter this kind of players :)
---
That person has the same name as me although the person in the picture is not me
---
That's a good point. I remember only being able to get my best 2 characters up to 500 but for the rest it was practically impossible, now it's a lot easier tho so that does make sense why teaming chilled out a little
---
Oh, i didn't noticed that in the game. I though it's idea xD
---
I did and i live in serbia
---
Which program do you use?
---
I posted it on this reddit cuz i feel it's my home and you are the only ones who will understand me and ye i posted it on other places
---
This is just a strategy man it's no big deal
---
Most important is riccochet
---
But the penny buff was unwarranted
---
Lol first they gotta fix existing servers…

Because supercell buffs and beefs based on the competitive meta 90% of the time. I agree for the majority of players, the buff was the wrong decision, but for pros, nita was weak.
---
But if mortis has super, he can 4 shot leon and kill him. But depends on the powercubes.
---
For movement speed you could probably remove a column, indicate (tiles/second) in the column header, and if that brawler has a movement speed increase/decrease add it in brackets next to the main (for example Bibi’s would be 2.4 (xx))
---
Just makes the spreadsheet a bit less cluttered
---
ha lol 😂😂😂
---
:'(
---
That makes sense

I first read DANK Mortis

That face at the icon

It's true

It's not takedown

I mean, your teammates look like they did almost all the damage, and those kills could have been done in amy 3v3, so don't use this as an excuse to play Mortis in heist. Seriously, don't.
---
ill take your entire stock
---
Lone star is straight up for someone with good teams

No, it's horrible
---
Thats ricochet

---
dan nog is het geen centre lol

I think the darryl only had rolling reload

I had 4
---
It s just for fun don t take it so serios :)) everybody knows that mortis sucks in heist
---
Spear time just reminds me of sans
---
Its Ricochet you stupid xD
---
So is that the reason I was lagging very little ...past 3-4 it's been lag  and lag all way ..losing all power plays
---
Crow white is a color change from the original Crow, you can pass it to 500 stellar points, it would be better since the star points are color change or exclusive skins like the wicks
---
i like the honesty
---
Imagine being them
---
I have tons of scetches of that skin idea but they all turn out bad.

when gene comes on offer, he will come with either a skin or 180 powerpoints.  240 gems would be the safest bet though gene himself should cost about 175.
---
I just realized that's human skin... Why would someone do that?
---
Ok
---
Ok thanks
---
she is close to top 10 but other ranged brawlers can beat her.
---
I will support this
---
10 power points for tick?? That's insane

He's legendary you really think they were going to keep him good?

---
He's legendary you really think they were going to let him stay good?
---
Thiccochet getting even thiccer with that extra HP. Same goes for Frank and Darryl
---
#NerfEmz
---
It's just his star power being nerfed. He's still good.
---
Uhhh... the update dropped a fair while ago...
---
Ik but it was fun while it lasted
---
Same as me but with Bibi instead of Tara!
---
Oh no, you're actually going to have to aim your shots now. My heart bleeds like a hemophiliac's.

So, you’re obviously a bastard from mongolia

thx!

249-349 gems

Health healed means artificial healing, not natural healing. Artificial healing is from supers/star powers, natural healing is not. Health healed referrs to the artificial healing.
---
Or when you pick anyone other than Piper and colt in lonestar
---
Holy shit I might try that out
---
This fits on r/OkBrawlerRetard
---
Also i would reccomend buying a legendary but ok
---
I was reading too quick and I feel I saw "Brawl Stars Money Back". Then I feel I heard the song "I want my money back, I want my money back".....so why do you guys hate it so much that you want your money back?🤣🤣🤣
---
I know, but I thought about a larger radius.
---
No honor.
---
Its cam not health
---
I don’t have that many gems 😕

If I were to rework Léon I would increase its invisibility duration and increase the range at which you can see him when he's invisible that way low hp low brawlers that don't do a lot of damage per hit  have a chance at surviving when being dived upon. Right now what's ridiculous with Leon is that you can play a showdown match not knowing there's a Leon in the game because he's across the map. The Leon gets his invisibility, runs across the map and melts you close range and there's nothing you can do because he moves faster, has higher dps up close and is fking invisible.
---
I only give ideas
---
Where did u get this?
---
I could see that if it was 1-0 them, but you were 1-1 and you guys were pushing on them to the point they had to sit back and be defensive. You’re wrong man it’s a game. Just chill and enjoy it. Stop posting such aggressive shit like “I carried this game so hard” or “Hate towards all spinner”.
---
Yes. I thought I would have to wait several months to get one. And after that I was back to 0.01 %.
---
I agree with FortheEnts. Looked like someone waiting for you to make a move rather than showboating
---
 **i'm back baby** !!!
---
I know this happened a long time ago, but please read this post "specifically the "Low-Effort memes" in **State of the Subreddit** part of the post. [Yes, you probably seen it](https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/drs41u/dear_supercell_is_brawl_stars_dying_the_current/). If not, you need to read it. 
---
Yes, I shared a lot of stuff in that section, and some information came SPECIFICALLY from this post (aka your comment and attitude with my comment). Also, I researched a bit and some people down there want to give you rewards for what you said, right? **Proving the subreddit is filled with repetitive garbage** (including your post) and other stuff rewarded me with a Platinum Award from the community manager, Ryan himself. 
---
\*Sign\*, your post is fine, but remember to not post repetitive memes and put low-effort titles. If you simply don't care, then that's fine with me. 
---
**What do you have to say now?**
---
This brawler has so much potential regarding skins.
---
WHAT ANIME IS THIS AND WHERE CAN I WATCH IT
---
Aww
---
You mean....Winnie the Pooh Nita skin
---
Well technically on the first goal we were 0-1. But yeah agreed on the defensive bit. And yeah id change the title if i could edit but cant. It was a hard core defense on my part is what i mean by carrying. Without their knockback wed have lost. As for the hate towards all spinner. Eh ill give ya that. I hate spining in game period.
---
Does he really need more health though? I agree with whoever said a mild shortening of his attack animation would be a great buff for him.
---
yes i know
---
Yeah
---
Maybe he discovered this right now
---
Don't be rude
---
Be patient
---
Soon this posts will disappear
---
Very cool skin ! I would love it to be added to the game since white crow is in my opinion the worst crow skin, and it costs 80 gems. Also, I think crow should get a remodel soon (I hope!), and it would probably involve a remodel for his skins. But I wouldn’t make like a separate skin since he has so much of them (5). Nice work!

What if you 👉🤓

I upgraded to rank 20 my jessie and bo this way
---
He is too dangerous to be left alive!
---
Me too that's so painful...
---
Oke
---
I haven’t been able to get a single star power in 4 months 🤨
---
I agree that they should have nerfed ambush, but I think they are trying to balance both Snappy Sniping and Ambush, as they are both getting merged with this change. She was becoming a little powerful, but still not nerf-worthy
---
That's a cool drawing but why are you in jail?
---
Sure! :)
---
Frank doesn’t need more health. He’s already the tankiest character in the game, and has a star power that makes him even tankier. Just make him attack faster
---
Thats the window 😂
---
* INVISIHEAL BUFF *.    |     * invisibility Nerf *

Ryan and Dani
---
I object! Good randoms are rare, but good randoms that press *play again* don't exist
---
So erm how do you score into your enemies goal?
---
r/croppingishard
---
Why everyone still thinking russians are with bears carpets and something like that i hate it cuz im rus
---
Or without super
---
Counter point - it's nice that the most powerful characters in the game aren't the most expensive ones to obtain.
---
Your arguements based on facts, written in your country's sources, considering that fact,  there is "cold war" between Russia and USA from 1947, most of countries(probably you are living in one of this countries) just writing history in "USA's version", where bad facts about Russian history  can be in the spotlight, when some oher facts can be covered in darkness... If to say it shortly: "Different countries write history of other countries, while basing on their own opinion".

la estrella sola
---
Sick of playing with randoms? post your ID here so we can team up and push trophies together because I am sick of playing showdown just to push trophies 🌚
---
I mean her Main attack is also very strong
---
High Can is a very important brawler stat.
---
Ну и для чего ты это сюда написал?
---
Buff leon
---
I agree as piper main, it will be better to nerf ambush, not her attack :/ She's getting more nerfs from update to update. F
---

Wait, THIS is what you meant by “talking to the devs”? I thought you meant sending an email to the dev’s reddit telling them your suggestions. But no, you talked to a support member who isn’t even part of the dev team YESTERDAY, and you believe you contributed to the buff? C’mon man that’s just egotistical nonsense
---
God, I really hate being a Piper main right now, I really don't agree that nerfing her main attack instead of her starpowers is even a sensible choice.
---
Thanks man
---
The best idea in this subreddit. Awesome
---
Log darryl?
---
Please that it costs you bro
---
Really, geez thanks dude
---
I think that was Kairos Time who said, which I totally agree with. He be able to dodge better, and hit more shots.
---
You're welcome, good job man
---
Atleast hé didn’t got nerf in the balance change of November 2019
---
In dome modes yea but the majority yes
---
She should summon a normal Tara, that would be funny
---
Okay cool, but how are we supposed to differentiate between ally and enemy shots then?
---
Good effort! Green pants tho
---
screeching solo doesn't charge poco's super

Nah fam you dumb

Welp, that’ll solve your gem problem for, like, ever

Bro you're on internet, not in your 3th grade class chat
---
u/MegaMrBob had the idea of having cool colours like Green Blue and Purple for allies and warm colours like Red Orange and Yellow for foes
---
Oooh, that’s a cool concept!
---
And sorry how many brawlers at level 4 fo u see on 700 trophies? Your queue would last for 30 minutes. They said it themselves its based of trophies which indicate your skill and not power level.

how would supercell make money from this??
---
When do these apply?
---
1. Don't use auto aim
---
2. From that clip, Leon is closer to the box than to the spike
---
Darryl don't need damage buff (darryl main here) but I'll take it.

What BiBi thing on Frank's hammer?

It looks 90% the same as the original model, no thanks

---
Look how they massacred my boi  😔  (Spike btw)
---
did you use star power glitch because for me it didnt work
---
Why they decrease piper’s damage instead of decrease ambush star power from 800=&gt;750
---
Hey

Winning is winning

This is so good

Not possible

Thanks for the reply. As far as the numbers go, they are vast estimates and I did address it in the post. I'm not sure what perspective allows you to say they are irrelevant, as I think they are hugely relevant to put things into perspective, *especially* for people who have never considered what I'm talking about here. I think "don't play with randoms" is just a mute point. It's a nothing statement. There's no point in joining a club at this time, most clubs are inactive. I've been in a couple top USA clubs and I sent out invites left and right and am one of the most active people in chat and people hardly ever accept invites, nor do they send them. And god forbid you lose 2 matches "gtg cya bye" before you're even back in the lobby. 
---
As for your 2nd point, you are correct. But it sure does take the fun out of the game when you're forcing yourself to a small selection of brawlers. Basically never use any of the fun brawlers...

F for my friend that likes spike very much and put spike to 1000
---
That’s basically a copy of my post ... eh upvote
---
I generally think he needs a range, radius and damage nerf
---
You’re doing el primo’s work my boy
---
The unly way theese work is with star power glitches
---
No more brawl ball
---
Holy shit that’s 4 tickets!!!

so what are you pointing out? that in every match you got no throphys?
---
Mood tho
---
I can’t win lol
---
k cuz when i do it it dosent work and my wifi is as good as darryl rolling into water and stopping in the middle
---
So it still doesn't match the balls in his guts? Going through all the trouble to implement new colors, and it still doesn't match? Great idea.
