“Barley”
---
Jessie
---
Every 2 weeks you get a token reward and any brawlers over 500 trophies have their trophy count over 500 cut in half, for example if at 600 you go to 550 because 100 over 500
---
the point is they dont want to lose trophies...
---
Damn and I'm over here struggling to get to 8k with 18 brawlers
---
Well, I can see the logic behind that. I don’t understand why though. All I can say is that if that is true, they shoulda released this game as an outer space game, which was the initial idea for Brawl Stars.

Your telling us that a purple fat man, A 9yo in a scaly suit, a pirate, and a Frankenstein monster belongs in a wild west setting? 
---
Yes the other basic brawler (OG) are in the wild was theme but that's how they look and we love them.

It would be nice to have this theme come back for a special event

Yes

They did. But you have to play siege
---
No, the true healer is Barley! “Ready to serve!”

It was fairly pointless

piper is the best brawler in the game

I got her to 500 trophies as level 7. She isn't weak at all. Just underrated.

Safes are centralised across the board now.

why is everyone saying 3 lanes lol

how can i help you today

I'm at 7k trophies with no mythics or legendaries. yes

My apologies to Barley, Spike, Jessie, Gene and Nita.
---
Do you know what “solo” means? The name of the game implies that working together is cheating. If you’d like to team up, may I interest you in one of the other game modes; duo showdown is especially attractive for your kind... unless the only reason you team is to 2 v 1 someone.
---
In life, you will eventually realize that there is a difference between what is legal and what is right; the former is determined by a small group while the latter is determined by the community. 
---
While teaming is not a banable offense, the vast majority of our community has agreed that teaming, while allowed, is not right; stop pointing to the governing body (Supercell) as support for your argument when they have also acknowledged what I am telling you. 
---
I originally thought siege would be 5v5 since the map is so huge, maybe something similar?

Hes is one if not the hardest brawler in the game. He is on pair with mortis in the level of difficulty.
---
Good luck landing 2 arrows 
---
Welp time to start putting spike faces on everything.
---
Am I? Doubt it. I’ve seen Shelly solo three brawlers at once too many times. Her super can kill primo like Leon could before and they both needed to be close to him

Sometimes I don't even understand it! Anyway thanks!

Thats why its so good
---
Cool idea, but I'd probably never use it because it could make you use Piper is solo showdown
---
Nice
---
Awesome!  There’s nothing else to it than that?  If my trophy total is over the required amount, I get the reward even if I don’t use my brawlers over 500?

For brawl ball just don’t play with randoms, always organise a team with right comp, for solo showdown depends on the map and the brawler that you are using since sometimes teaming is the only solution, for duo showdown try to get as many boxes as you can at the start

Bushcamping... fk I hate showdown, such a blow to the value of trophies

---
No, they’re saying that both people who have and don’t have crow both want him to be buffed
---
Lmao wtf happend in there
---
It works tho, and I’m sorry that you looked into the mirror
---
Could Also be a Bo skin
---
i did before gene came out
---
I hope this is a joke. Its called attack animation. Also , there are different serves... such as U.S east
---
Pam is broken
---
~~buff crow~~ I dont have an opinion

Not true

---
Thanks for the feedback! Im thinking that his super should be slow to charge. He is short range so it would be hard for him to fight those who are far away from him. Maybe the super shouldnt have damage. Do you think the star power needs a change? 
---
Lol yah
---
[removed]
---
True but if you get all you shots off point blank then that would be 9 daggers worth of poison. Maybe it could go up to 3 at a time and then you could add more when the effect wears off
---
 Wow hm does it cost
---
Well, it was because making things like Brawlers were easier if there was really no theme at all.
---
Turns out they removed the add by code thingy, Heres a [link to add me] 
---
The other thing is a 100 attack is nothing so it would have to be closer to 7 or 800. Think about in solo sd how many hits that would be on a single box haha
---
What about a knight Tara?
---
For me, it was 31.5 with the least expensive shipping method.
---
Hi Dev Team,
---
I love the game and really really want it could be more fun in near future. I’m sure fixing the following issues could pull off more in-app purchase:
---
- more game modes (expect ~ more than 10, not take into acct the special events)
---
- rewards on each 100 rank diversified, by now it just looks boring and repetitive.
---
- joining club is totally useless by now. Please make some benefit team member can utilize when in a club.
---
The first 1000 rank u guys doing well but when I look at the next 3000 rank I have just sighed 🙄 this game deserves some investment!
---
Your lower trophy count than i am... but sure. 
---
You get extra gold/coins 
---
nah, i killed two leons in a row from medium-to-close range, and one went surprised me when i just narrowly killed another. if a spike can throw out his spikes quickly, leon is dead
---
YEEES
---
Literally no one thinks that
---
Literally Unplayable 
---
Só podia ser BR kkkkkk
---
What do people spin?
---
He's not OP. Just because one person is good with him doesn't mean he's broken.
---
I can aim well but for some reason it just starts pouring in like 5 spreaded out streams and its FOOCKING ANNOYING
---
I can't believe my eyes 👀. This is AWESOME! 😍
---
Haha yeah 😂
---
Pam is just a bit(alot) less fatter
---
Could happen on accident way too often. Supercell already said they’re fine with teaming
---
Shipping is 13$ of me (USD)
---
Kkkkk
---
thank god theres someone with worse luck than me
---
im at 5.8 k and im in the same situation
---
I laughed way to hard at this
---
Ouch...
---
Creative
---
Remember to turn off auto rotate too!
---
I have Shelly
---
Yeah, lol
---
This is just a picture of legs, I think you forgot to post it right, mate.
---
This is why there has to be 2  brawlers who do it at the relative time and the movements must closely resemble a spinning motion to avoid accidents.
---
That’d be reaaal nice too hahah
---
I think you didn't read my whole Reply
---
Well done dude lmao
---
I'm noob? What am I playing since the game was in beta? ;)
---
I got 30 boxex, then i think. Hey, i will open them. i got crow.
---
I wouldn't recommend the poco plushie. The hat is flat and its meh. I only got it be hes my favorite brawler 
---
IKR? Still missing 2 despite playing since day 1
---
Are you a fellow who has no legendaries but has high trophies like me?
---
Now that would actually make sense
---
Is this tanooki gene from Mario?
---
O shit
---
Very true :/ 
---
When piper wins
---
Hmm, u sure, I haven't checked my battle logs...
---
What's ur name on Brawl Stars?
---
What forest theme???
---
which is what we want and is what I did
---
Can we talk about the fact every box you opened either had Spike and Frank tokens or Spike and Dynamike tokens
---
this is actually too good
---
Same 😂
---
I’m lvl 5 at 162
---
Duo really needs to up the trophies earned
---
It was luck he is f2play
---
Penny, my captain!! &lt;3
---
Literally the only fucking thing that comes out of everyones mouth right now. No, he doesn't need a buff. Fuck, why are people so fucking retarted.
---
Thanks for telling me Just-a-regular-toast I'll re-upload it on the day
---
Maybe it's not a forest theme but did you see the map passage? That type of theme
---
Haters will say it’s fake.
---
Penny
---
This is also the issue with the loading page
---
I love it! No problems with any solution. Teaming is teaming and must be stopped in any way possible. 
---
You didn't even gave any stats.
---
Thank you! Yes teaming has to go.
---
Holy crap this is pure gold lmfao. I would love to see more, keep it up.
---
Yeah I’m a first day beta player but never played during this time cause I quit around when brawl ball came out and only redownloaded at global launch.
---
As a ftp player I am scared for the battle pass what if it costs like 10 gems
---
What the fuck did you just bring upon this cursed land.jpg
---
Great skin 👍
---
Do you know what a percentage is?
---
😉 Hope to see Crow higher on Coach Cory's next brawl stars overall tier list!
---
Tron Shelly lol

Auto aim
---
mythic: swiggity swooty ill come for ur booty
---
Check out my post for an anti teaming idea!
---
Oh I think I know what ur talking about now. How dumb I was...
---
First I have played Clash Royale so much but I moved on to Brawl Stars .Because of it's Strategy based gameplay , community freachers and youtube Brawl😅
---
Ik that's the point
---
Mine is in my home screen
---
It's me, Gene
---
They said are going to make clubs more interesting/useful if I'm not mistaken
---
I know, but bear in mind that matchmaking doesn't consider power level, therefore u can be matched with some dude who has a brawler with star power and 0 trophies (those people exist and they're annoying). I think matchmaking should consider both brawler trophies and power level
---
Nah
---
Lol I posted the same thing like 2 weeks ago yet you still got more up votes then me feels bad man
---
We need it!
---
From graffiti, to illegal fireworks Mike lives a life of crime.
---
is this real? dont have my phone on me now
---
??wut??
---
I think it fits him and it’s not something to over bearing. Gives him a legendary kind of power and play style 
---
now i can lose even more trophies :D
---
How could I not come up with this?
---
That’s me who commented I love it!
---
Do me I was 33 USD
---
I would like to ask you ?, why do not you enable the option to change your name again, even if it has an additional cost of 20 or 10 gems, and why do not you implement the option of being able to speak with group members by voice?
---
Thanks!
---
I can tell but like ;-;
---
We need it! We want the battle pass!
---
As someone who plays a lot of barley, yes
---
Pfft only 42 digits? Come back when you know 1000
---
It’s MAAM
---
sorry I had to
---
I hate you to
---
Nice Job Can't Wait To See A Piper Skin 
---
Lagging every 2 seconds is bigger issue 
---
Thanks! 
---
What
---
Reminds me of a Pokémon 
---
Sniper gene
---
I’m saying that at the moment, no matter how many daggers you hit, poison will deal 98 damage a tick. My recommendation is for how many daggers you hit, thats how many times the damage you do. So if you hit 3 daggers you do 294 poison damage per tick, 2 daggers 196 damage per tick, and 1 dagger at 98 damage per tick
---
Why not
---
G A M E R    S K I N
---
Oh holy crap sorry i thought i was replying to my own comment. 
---
Sorry for any contusion

Reminds me of a Pokémon or a character from DBZ

---
Got 4 big, 33 small and a mega box ready
---
I’m pretty sure the game doesn’t update every brawl box. I’m not sure how often it does update, but I do know the only way to increase your chances is by opening more boxes :/
---
Take the hint
---
I myself have never experienced lag while connected to WiFi on my normal iPhone 6
---
What's his power? 
---
Trophy droppers will love this
---
Literally see the red wifi sign every time I try to play
---
~~Skull Creek, Cavern Churn, Feast or Famine, Island invasion and Dune Drift~~
---
Something with his cane, you can decide if you’d like
---
Every brawl box you open increases legendary drop rate. It doesn't matter what box. I'm not sure but it's quite possible that you have reached the max drop rate %. The % you have is the same as the default one when you play for the first time. 
---
Aw crap
---
I'm really tired that people see a skeleton and instantly Sans appear...
---
You mean musketeer Penny
---
They should be disguised as Power Cube Boxes(or whatever they are called) in Showdown.
---
When you destroy the Box....
---
A BOMB EMERGES
---
Unless it is a Power Cube Box....
---
BUT SOMETIMES THE POWER CUBES ARE TNT
---
That’s what I call leader
---
Crow not being buffed.
---
How did Sunny lose 4 trophies, even though they placed 3rd in the second game?
---
I’ve been monitoring the sub for posts about this topic for a while, and unfortunately I’ve seen several players quote 0.25% as their odds. I don’t expect to see that great an increment, but I’m just concerned about the fact that mine is stuck at the default rate and has not budged even after opening hundreds of boxes D:
---
Hey, you miss the cloak!
---
Uhm yea, why?
---
I'm making a video about skins gamer Osterman
---
He has 4 ears...
---
As in global or beta? I’ve been playing since beta and I’m also missing 2.
---
Is this a crossover with Hollow Knight? Looks cool either way though
---
I do understand that! Problem is, the rate hasn’t budged ever since I started monitoring it before Gene’s release, as I saved up a bunch of boxes for him. Is the luck increment just that small? I’d be comforted even if there was an increase from 0.1104 -&gt; 0.1105%, haha. Anything to know that the rate is going up, even if it takes 100 boxes to push it by 0.0001%!
---
Ew 1 tile gap, gl navigating through those
---
Tbh those odds are pretty good compared to mine. I'm at 0.0288%
---
Haters gonna hate
---
ummmm. The fact that at max level his when all shells hit its 2800 damage. He can also three shot majority of the brawlers. 
---
Best idea ever.
---
Right, people are hating on this because they wouldn’t want to do it. I just want to be able to, they don’t have to.
---
Beta
---
He probably is. 
---
I see! Did you receive a new brawer within the last month or two? :) I hope yours increases soon!
---
To clarify, I’m not concerned by the absolute rate itself, just the fact that it hasn’t been budging at all in spite of the many boxes I’ve opened.
---

All these beauty... I love birds &lt;3
---
I love this it’s amazing!
---
 How are they going to fix lag? You can’t fix delay in connections lmao😂
---
I’ve heard that getting a Mythic causes your Legendary drop rate to take a huge hit, which is probably why yours dropped so much. Congrats on Gene though! :D
---
I mean like fix there servers or put me in nearby servers not ones on the other side of the world
---
Brasil sil sil
---
ALWAYS
---
Oof 
---
At least all three of the Mythic’s are cool tho 
---
Bruh my main is at 10.5k and I recently got my legendary 
---
SHOOT DETERGENT
---
Yeah. Big oof for that
---
Executioner Carl you mean?
---
There is already a concept like this out there but it’s well executed. It deserves more upvotes ❤️
---
Yeah. Big oof for that 
---
Technoloshelly
---
Oh no.   What have you done.
---
New skin confirmed.  Instead of dropping bombs, (s)he lays a big Waft that launches him and damages opponents.
---
Man ya I’m not sure about that. I had about 200 boxes save up for leon and after I opened them up, my % went up about .05% but for you to not go up anything is kind of crazy
---
OH NOOOOOOO 
---
jessie tenfold 
---
Penny forever my boi ❤
---
quite good if i do say so myself
---
No it’s just something people would like to have happen
---
I love this! Feels perfect for Mortis.
---
Wow, love the image!
---
My favourite brawler is Penny! The second one is Poco an third Mortis the magnificient.
---
Yeah it's a great idea and I really wanted this for a long time! When I use crow or piper in 3v3, I can NEVER jump down, and I can only go right, left, or unfortunately, up. This really screws me up.
---
Same
---
...but not the worst!
---
He doesn'tt
---
Why not trade system ?
---
Does that answer your question for why there should be no battle pass though?
---
There are no innocent children these days from everything they are exposed to. And racial slurs do matter
---
So surreal yet, so savage
---
sometimes what you want is not what I want, it's not what your neighbor wants, it's not what Supercell wants
---
Interesting fact. I am NOT calling anyone a liar (I would never accuse someone of that without solid evidence), but may I ask where could someone find information like the Crow win rates (again, just for the sake of me learning)?
---
That aside, showdown.... glad to see Crow has success in a mode, but showdown is not known to be a competitive game mode (E-Sports, How often top players rely on showdown, etc). I know he is also good in heist, though I suspect (based on my own experience and other rankings) that his viability in heist does not compensate for the other modes.
---
Now as much as I want a buff for Crow, I also know and openly admit that he does have a lot going for him. He has speed, poison (prevents healing), and fair range. Also, his super makes good for takedowns or fleeing when he needs. However he has minimal HP (only gets that 10% reduction IF he has his star power),  at 392 damage per dagger (hard to get all to hit unless at close range, BAD IDEA for crow), he has low DPS, and a SLOW charging super (according to the wiki thats 8 daggers + poison). What I really want to see is SC letting him charge his super faster (5 daggers flat, but poison no longer charges super). 
---
Know how after you lose 3 times in a row, you are pitted against teams with much lower power/trophies? Apparently draws also count towards 3 losses.
---
(It doesn’t show on the screenshot but I won before the 2 draws in a row.)
---
Also I have a hunch that the “weak players” are just bots. Would appreciate if anyone can confirm or disprove this.
---
Lucky
---
This comment right here officer
---
I will destroy the blood lines to however made this
---
lmao this is a joke, it will never work and instant kill makes the game shit, 
---
i know what percentages are and i know you arent trying to Sound rude, and neither am i, what i meant is that obviously there are percentages for each rarity and lets again just say that its 1% thats 1/100 then the random number generator would pick a number between 1-100 and if it hit the trigger range example 57 it would drop a legendary brawler (and yes i know that its on a much larger number scale)
---
as sector would say: "o"
---
At least click on the archer queen ability stats xd
---
The Brawlers continue to fail us in ways we didn't know were possible
---
It would be awesome if Leon could have a costume like an Assassin or Snake; Poco like Slash (or someone else); Piper like a Geisha; Bo like Hawkeye, Elf, etc. Frank like Hulk or Hulkbuster.
---
And a new brawler who can fire leaves (or whatever) and a tornado as a super that moves and keep the enemies in the center of it dealing damage.
---
Thanks. 
---
First of all, thanks for the advice and not to worry about the numbers. I agree with your idea because if you get to obssesed then you might just freak out. Secondly, your username...(nothing against it)
---
big facts
---
I agree with you, buuut if you give a perfect or close jump on the enimie, you can deal a good amount of damage or even finish with the enimie 😄
---
Omg
---
So Nice Of SC To Be Like That!
---
Looks REAL gud
---
Nice.
---
cuz their trash or they lose their in siege by tilting idk, theres so many ways to lose trophy don't get me started on randoms
---
Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
---
He didn’t even crop out the OPs name lol
---
Battle pass is controversial that one is a 50/50
---
How you did it
---
lmao 
---
Removed - Your post is too short, please expand on your title.
---
Where is he?
---
spike I base on the white eagle and I put different colors is not only white and yellow thanks for your comment
---
No, the percentage number is always the same, its not rng because its already determined. The legendary chance doesn't constantly go from .1 to .2 to .05 etc., its always the same and its pickee up from the range (100%)
---
I'm pretty sure he will 😂
---
I did it twice today and it makes me real happy 
---
Its sad how i want this in the game, but youre a 2D artist! :(
---
Keep your post titles descriptive and provide context. For instance, if your post is about an in-game suggestion your title should include a brief description of what your idea is.

I got impatient and opened 20 brawl boxes and 4 big boxes. Even worse, i got nothing in the end
---
r/tihi
---
Haha I tried to play duos with a friend but didn't end up well :( I think it's due to bad communication cuz I wanted to split and find as many power cubes as we can while he wanted to stick together and teamfight. (He was on crow btw)
---
YOUR SOUL IS MINE

I mean unless you’re in the middle bull is pretty ass on Hot Point

Tbh I have probably upvoted only a couple posts here on Reddit even after a year, and I’ve got to say this truly deserves an upvote for you artistic talent

Too old

Nun there’s plenty, but there are some better ones.

oh no you did

Feast or famine I love it the risks you have to take and stuff
---
fortnite bad upvotes to the left
---
Actually that's a leak of new spike remodel. 
---
Jessie all the way
---
I like how you used a very old image
---
It’s suppose to be sans...
---
ELLLL PRIMOOOOO
---
Why did this comment on the other comment getting silver get silver?
---
Wow amazing!
---
“SLURP” Nice
---
Every Time you get a mythic both tour mythic AND legendario drop chances reset
---
So they don't get kidnapped, just got back from a kidnapping actually, guy didn't block out his IGN in a video.
---
too
---
it’s better to open boxes right as you get them just incase you get a token doubler. then you get more to open more boxes in one session. it’s less satisfying but you can get more stuff 
---
Nice, will there finally be a countdown to Carl in the Brawler selection screen?
---
V
---
Write that again in English
---
i got my first legendary leon at 5.8k a couple days ago. 4k is nothing, some beta players have reached 8k+ and still have no legendariws
---
600 trophies no epic our mithics
---
but
---
i have spike!!!
---
note: all my Friends at school hates me for my luck!!!
---
at least rework the f#%$#ng skin if you end the promotion cause the offer for 299 gems included the nw mortis and then the offer apeared for mortis separately so u should at least give her some boots
---
That's OP
---
Same happened to me, OP. 
---
I don't see Karma hitting you when you spun at the end
---
I have no idea, please forgive me 
---
How is this an "update"?
---
Give us carl!
---
Yeah... for some strange reason... hehe...
---
El primo says that
---
Thank you soooo much for finally nerfing Jessie 😂
---
We want Carl, we are mid March! Where is he!
---
#MAN PERFUME
---
Thank you for the Jessie nerf in big game
---
This soooo awesome best meme ever I laughed so much lmao
---
Thanks m8
---
i always open the brawl boxes then the big's and last one the mega
---
You’re welcome, it has been pretty cool lurking in this sub 🌚
---
Dang no Crow buff.. :(
---
Yeah, just ask ryan, he confirmed
---
Dude only 60 3v3 wins and 8k trophies how is this even possible? 
---
What's the best way supercell could put an end to this stupid shit? 
---
Mortis gang upvoted this concept ⬆️
---
Dumb ass
---
You could join a better club if your in a club that is not that active or has low players, I usually play with my bro or a friend that knows how I play so we both play the same way depending the situation. 
---
I used a game image as base, don't ask to me XD
---
“Never meant to do damage” does not equal to “damage soooo low and so ez to be killed”. He is for sure not DPS. Let’s assume he is a support. All other supports can easily kill crow. Why not set him to be 500 health and 10 damage because “crow was never meant to do damage”? Ok, Supercell has such an accurate win rate system that most players don’t agree with. Why more balances if it’s this accurate? Accurate win rate systems should already provided perfect parameters without any further change. If Supercell is this accurate, there wouldn’t be this many people quitting the game. Even under this post, see how many people requesting crow buff. Once again, don’t tell me how accurate this game’s system is. If the complaint is significantly higher than all other complaints, Supercell should take actions. Players are not the fool. 
---
Also, stop defending for Supercell. Even all YouTube players request buff crow. Don’t tell me you have deeper insight than all of them.
---
Do u realize how old this is 
---
its possible to get gene + legendary or legendary + legendary, like a 1 in 2 chance to get either of them i guess, no one really knows the numbers
---
id love to see this in color too but im really terrible at colors lol ;b
---
Same. Sometimes I will keep rolling with them if they've proven they're legit. 
---
Well my clan is just got my friends in it, I got an active friend but he does like the complete opposite of what I want him to do. XD so it’s incredibly hard to push for 400 as mortis 
---
If your going to complain this much just play another brawler because “you” suck with crow.
---
Get skills to play with him. 
---
Thx Sherlock 
---
Almossssssst hot as my girl Jessie.
---
Asia? 
---
Meanwhile they cant even buff Crow properly...
---
Thought this was r/ShitpostCrusaders
---
Nice man once in a lifetime experience
---
And is not again fixed! 
---
I supposed this apply to all male characters 'cause game is family friendly, but I use a in-game image as base, I'm not censoring nothing.
---
Should I buy? with 60sgd?
---
Mike Sons of anarchy?
---
I ve seen u before somewhere
---
Sadly Asians cant participate
---
Pretty much
---
I understand because I am also an asian
---
First of all, I was being sarcastic. 
---
Second of all, this is not even close to being funny.
---
Don't kill leon like mortis remove this or else sc might just do it
---
Where 
---
Sansssssss
---
that would be dope with some repolish
---
Soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo Cooooooooooooooooollll!
---
I need a player behavior reporting system after the game ends.
---
Erm........ NO!
---
Shameless money grabbing
---
the problem with night witch mortis was it looked like he cross dressed, a completely different female model for leon would be a different situation
---
Man Darryl's short,adorable
---
Dude she got nerfed in Big Game. Were you reading?
---
Happy cake day dude
---
Lol
---
So true...kill the pig and ur Mortis XD
---
Frank Was Pretty Right, It's On Game Terms "Don't Ofend Any Players Be Or Don't Be Randons.
---
Really nair!
---
How would this stop teaming exactly. Your first statement be clear about what is and isn’t a bannable offense. Teaming is not and will not be a reason to ban someone. Supercell has stated that.  
---
There was a thread the other day that basically came up with a great solution. We will see if supercell takes that suggestion though.
---
Cow
---
Yes. I have 50 boxes.
---
Tganks for yelling me, i got it from someone on discord and put it here
---
The big turret that you're supposed to defend in siege
---
They literally did this. Read the notes
---
Ich bin halt bei 3700 und brauche nen neuen Brawler /:
---
Finally. That turret is so annoying in my opinion.
---
Me too getting the same error
---
Jessie!
---
21/22 of  march theres a countdown 
---
Maaaaaybe 3 more. Then, It might be enough.
---
If you look closer at one of the photos it says he's 2742 trophies
---
Just meant a somewhat rare brawler
---
YES
---
Do it
---
They only did this for Brock though 
---
crow is weak anyways.. 
---
Hey u got a box very similar to mine  i got tara and piper from a big box
---
Wish Granted, your mind has now been changed. Your opinion is now reversed
---
Yeah in this game it’s pretty easy to max as F2P. I didn’t spend any money and I have all my brawlers at 8-9 power level and 7 star powers
---
No, they made it so that brock can't hit it while standing outside (so they enlarged the range of the IKE turret). This means that other brawlers will have a harder time as well
---
Wat
---
wanna team with me ?
---
i got muted from the discord and its been like a month
---
Same thing look at mine
---
That's why I want him...he is going to get a buff and we know what happened to darrly and mortis.
---
📺 https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEONwxYwSdWqOcy7N-OzcIA
---
I just realized that leon has the only super that isn't targeted 
---
I dont count carl
---
Ggs
---
Ikr.
---
Why did this get silver?
---
Pennnny !
---
PMM PLSSS
---
Not for $45USD.
---
Everyone got the offer it looks like.
---
It might be some sort of bug , I've also find that replays were available on some of the matches I played. 
---
Come back to the clan xD
---
very cool.
---
Me too but with legendary! Leon and spike!!! Now I can finally push to 2000 trophies!!,
---
Make a male Nita
---
Holy damn!
---
there's no remodel bruh
---
They probably changed the way it thinks.........it.....iT.....IT.....ITT
---
Gene had a blue background when he was showed in the brawler list.
---
Everybody got it. Its because you did not bought it. Its not bug at all
---
I wanna fk her so badly 
---
I GET IT
---
For making map, i using Brawl Map Maker, you can download it in App Store and Google Play
---
For making skins, i dont know what they using
---
shell primo
---
THanks
---
SAVE IT  FOR CARL
---
25 dollars a steal😂
---
Put the hat on Goddamnit
---
Yo shout out to Pam who earn 100+ trophies at level 1
---
ha ha HA HAHA
---
It's going to be huge, really. I was prioritizing getting in the middle before the bot was even killed before. Now, might not need to do that as much. And, as offense, you can be more aggressive about potentially dying without getting too severely punished.
---
The matchmaking system works on the basis of the trophies, and does not take into account the power levels at all
---
You
---
Jessie’s range is longer...
---
The order doesnt really matter in terms of chances, but you should open the small boxes so if you get carl from them you can save the rest of the big and mega boxes.
---
And also Posts about repetitive posts.
---
Done
---
I got Pam to rank 15 at level 1. She was incredibly op before all the recent updates and changes
---
I bought creature of night today
---
I would buy this in a heartbeat 
---
Why dont you want best skin in game
---
thank you
---
This is my first time drawing anything for something ever 😅 i know im really bad 😂
---
Different formats 
---
He says that Mortis is a legend, but he does need his Hat of course :p
---
Hello, I enjoy playing but lacks communication between players in teams, that will make the organization of the game easier, could be like clash Royale, Greetings from Chile
---
Sorry autocorrect I meant Broked
---
Last time opened 300 boxes to get Gene(got her) my thumb was sore for like 4 hours afterwards
---
Click the link for more info.
---
Mortis is a legendary 
---
I’d rather just get the crow offer.
---
OMG
---
The only problem I see are those two inside islands. Brawlers who spawn there get free boxes with no competition and can camp there for a large amount of time. Also, if you’re choosing not to camp, you’d have to jump immediately into another brawler. Otherwise, great map! I’d like to see an island-style showdown map come to brawl stars.
---
it will kill the character's personality
---
Maybe you could unlock universal sometimes out of boxes?
---
Bruh... Hes a super rare he wont be hard to get. I have like 90 small boxes and a mega. And been saving for like 2 weeks?
---
Idk I dont even have her star power yet
---
Мне?
---
Me too 👎😔
---
Really just prejudice man, I think everyone's hopping on the Fortnite bad train and everything that's within it is bad.
---
ok good for you?
---
What would enhance the enemy not knowing where his super is though? If you place the mines strategically the enemy won't see where they're at already, not much you can really do to "change" that. I think his star power is really unique, supercell just needs to find a way to balance it out so that it's useful but not broken
---
I have 75 chests pending, this is exactly how I felt.
---
yes officer this man right here
---
When you drink lemonade 
---
Huh
---
She shouldn't be able to attack during super
---
Super should also make her faster so that she can escape from close range and shotgun brawlers in bushes
---
It is not the best.Its his opinion.
---
Pls gimme link
---
And I thought the on-release new champs in league were overpriced.
---
People never fail to amaze me
---
Worlds saddest frank
---
Ciao
---
same but my friend u/eddiereee got leon with pure luck
---
wow that'd be amazing
---
I thought this was an oh skin idea, it looks so similar to the old mike
---
I'd reckon it'd do little to change said character's personality, considering how wildly some skins can vary from the source material granted. Take Caveman Frank or Dumpling Daryll for example.
---
How did you got that mortis pic and name with your name?
---
Now watch me whip
---
I’m too poor to afford the deal. Can anyone spare $50 and help a lonely 3300 trophy brother out?
---
The thing is when three brawlers are left I don't consider it teaming it's simply doing what you can to win obviously you were seen as a threat from both people and they knew if they went after each other you would win. The problem is when 3 or more brawlers work together when there are still 7 or 8 people alive or in some situations when there are 6 brawlers left and 5 are teaming but your example is fine with supercell it is the latter they dislike.
---
Yeah but you might get that in a box 
---
I do not mind this function!
---
LMAO SO TRUE
---
Not in showdown either. Just because a character is good in a lot of places doesn’t mean they need a nerf
---
Same to me and i rebooted phone and still nothing
---
Tara's scar is the mark of her contract with Gene, letting him live inside her body. After Gene left her, the mark became a scar.
---
Upvote plz
---
kk
---
That is a great idea. Although maybe slightly too OP
---
Also both your ideas are no offense pretty bad personally my favourite way to possibly fix showdown is the bonus trophies for kills I feel this could also help stop tilting say a person gets two kills but then a 3rd guy comes up bam you come 8th but you only lose like 1 trophy for 2 kills. Only problem is kill stealing 
---
That's pretty awesome. Did you use pens or poster colours?
---
I'm at 7k and 18/23
---
Yeah i noticed i fucked up. Just seemed logical 
---
5k and its still like that 
---
Are u sure?
---
It’s normally 300 gems for the skin
---
Go to r/Brawlstars and then click that ... at right upper corner there it is
---
You use the translate. Hahaha i take 3 hours in this pic
---
I am so happy that Carl is going to release after the Holi Festival and I am sure that some of you guys also saves your brawl boxes for Carl I hope that we all get Carl or any Legendary brawler..IMAO😆😆
---
THANKS FOR THE CARL SUEPRCELL TEAM.

Using an iPhone (X Series)???
---
Hey. I was wondering if you were thinking on taking out any soon a Tara skin where she turns to male. Perhaps a ninja who throws shurikens instead of cards?
---
It is just due to the fact that i have maining her lately and i would love a skin of a ninja.
---
Kind regards
---
Nope i've done around 20 seconds against a big boss crow that was afk
---
Woah, great
---
He’s really more of an assassin with more health instead of a tank. You can’t be careless with how you’re playing him thinking you can rush like bull or primo because it wont work. Darryl can clap anybody at any levels but you have to know how he works.
---
Don’t leave us hanging. Who won? You or Brock?
---
Play and pause , backward and forward
---
I have like 40 lol

I said same in your pic, i like your painting style.

Thanks

Oh my.. i tought that too. I will change my concept 😂
---
Pretty accurate for me except I actually get the trophies back in showdown thankfully.
---
open the mega box first.
---
You can buy this game for free though. 
---
Too hot for a 7+ game😍
---
this comment chain made me spit out my water
---
They said Mid-March first though
---
how???
---
uh
---
She seems to do a bunch less damage than barley though
---
This is not gonna make a big change in your luck bcs it doesn't gets a reset when you unlock a brawler. It just drops depending on rarity in this case it will just take your ~15 boxes of chance I think. I didn't calculated it but...
---
Wut?
---
That looks so clean ! Great job bro
---
Ola amigo come eat that taco
---
Because games are meant to be fun
---
Ike kills everything I think is what it stands for
---
91 gems*. So slightly less of a bad deal
---
Oufff that guy is sad 
---
This is so funny😂😂😂Nice work Everybody should see this👍🙌😂
---
Cool 
---
Someone's gonna wank to that. Not me, just someone.
---
Just remember that some perceived "percent off" they slap onto a price doesn't change the price. Rather than looking at it like you're saving 25%, just view the 750 gem price point. This is for buying anything in life but especially SC microtransactions.
---
It's also not really a deal when everything constantly has these "sales". They just price high and give a "deal" that is still high. Evaluate the prices on whether they're worth it to you, but only you and you alone can answer that.
---
You can say that pam, poce, etc are not good in this game mode
---
So then they missed the joke. For some reasons, I got downvoted
---
If your on mobile go the r/brawlstars and in the top right tap the 3 dots and then hit change community flair!
---
Not”not good in this game mode” unplayable 
---
Lol always a spinner
---
I know😂So was that
---
No one wanted to buy this at 59 gems me included good luck selling that for 150 RIP
---
Rather sky wars
---
what is he talking about?? i’m always wondering
---
a pro can handle that ;)
---
There used to be a grammar error in the message, he’s saying they fixed it.
---
Yea i bought spme brawlers for real cash but never on legendary. I got crow from brawl box. When i was like 2000 trophies. Now i am 4000 and still waiting for second one
---
Buy it. Crow is getting a buff soon
---
Sure poco with no heal 👍👍👍
---
Everyone would be.
---

Don’t you hate it when you aim straight down the middle but your piss goes the other direction?

It was a joke. Chill out mate.

I actually think that the 7% DPS buff was exceeded.

HEEEEREEE’S CARLLL!!!!

El primo uses launch pad to launch himself with 10 gems
---
Bamboozle the enemy and jump to the other jump pad to fly all they way back
---
New Brawler: Camil
---
Health:3920
---
Main attack: Camil throws a paint grenade (lobbs) that damage enemies and reduce their defense (they take more damage per hit at max level).
---
Damage: 140
---
Increased Damage taken: 14% DOES STACK. The effect resets when an enemy is defeated.
---
Super: Camil heals herself and her allies (regardless of distance) over a short period of time
---
Healing per second: 220
---
Seconds of Healing: 10
---
Star Power: Camil is not revealed when she takes damage in a bush.
---
Supercell should consider putting a few of your skins into the game! This is beautiful artwork worthy of being put into the game! Well done!
---
Usd
---
you’re the same age as regular leon
---
I understand that but just dont understand what they will do with heroes that heal themselves (pam,mortis,poco etc)
---
Have you tried force quit the app and after turning on and off airplane mode  and turning off and on wifi which ever data connection you’re using?
---
Others have been able to get through by keeping trying 😉
---
So do you think a sniper that is designed to be a short range brawler is fine?
---
Took me little over a month to get all legendaries you’ll get them eventually 
---
This isn’t too... foreign... of a concept! I’ll see myself out..
---
Sooooo op
---
Thought Holi is at 21st march lol 
---
So... Why are we here
---
Que Paso con el lanzamiento global de supercell ID
---
They may heal, but not as much as they do. This is just a concept
---
Ever heard of a little thing called "assassins"? If leon decloacks behind you, super away. Mortis getting to close? Super away. Darryl rolled onto you? Super. It helps piper survive and keep her range 
---
Interesting
---
It is stolen 
---
[how to become a pro tara](https://youtu.be/O531hO7Uq98) 
---
I would buy this
---
*GYROOOOO*
---
I guess that will work
---
I hope so
---
Carl shares the same concept with the Executioner, so it should have an Executioner skin!
---
Ha ha
---
Supercell came up with this ideas but left it :(
---
So cool
---
Is Megashadow intended to be the same as the normal Shadow? I saw both of them with the same stats (both with 2400 HP and 400 attack). Is this a bug?
---
That’s not how it works buddy
---
Actually more like Skin Ideas.
---
Thx!
---
how what works
---
I guess what I've never understood is why you would even have power level in the first place if people wanted to solely be matched with those who have the same level... There's no purpose to a levelling and stats system if you aren't matched with people of different levels, within reason of course. I get that it's frustrating, but those people likely grinded for those stats and if they were only matched with those of the exact same level, then what's the purpose? The amount of time they've spent on the game should give them some kind of advantage.

When will you increase the amount of gold from brawl boxes???

Makes sense now. 😆😆😆 anyway good job man. I like it how you give time to creating all these amazing skins. I really hope seeing quite a few in the games. 
---
AQUA GENE is the best one ever. 
---
I agree with this

Jokes appart, that would be a nice El Primo skin tho

Sorry I don't speak rice

Yeet

And summon an invisible Bear...

No... I understand how the “wheel” works, it just doesn’t show the next skin while scrolling to the left properly

No comment.

I ABSOLUTELY LOVE YOUR ART KEEP DOING WHAT YOURE DOING
---
Better than the other games like clash royale
---
Can they actually make clubs useful first?
---
*Moles start burrowing in*
---
Cool
---
Haha :)
---
Nooooooooo but why😣😣😣
---
Just curious why you decided to open right now instead of waiting a week for a chance at Carl.
---
And get those sweet 💎💎💎 after 
---
U r super lucky thenn....
---
Sakura-chan
---
So far, 6 big boxes and 167 brawl boxes. Still have almost 7 days to grow that!
---
They should hire you as a VA designer. You'd make skin designs then the 3D Artist would turn them into 3D models or something.
---
Because I won a giveaway so I can buy him with gems👍👍👍

WoW, when did you start saving? And how did you get that much?
---
brawl stars in a nutshell
---
HAHAHAHAHA 500$!?! DUDE EVERYONE KNOWS ITS RIGGED. you should have calculated your chance to get something before getting 500$ worth of gems
---
bruh
---
Just use money lol
---
I have a Samsung J7 Prime, but I don't have the option for internal sound recording in Mobizen.
---
I had the same offer too
---
I started saving right after Gene was released the 2nd time.
---

If it weren't for the skins and a new gamemode this could have actually been real

---
You can still save boxes to get power points for him after unlocking him with gems.  
---
I'm still debating if I want to buy him with gems and try to get him higher level, or just not waste the gems. Maybe if they have a Carl + power points offer for gems I'll buy that.
---
I'm impressed about how much creative you are
---

---
I like the shell what if gene will be disguise as Lord Krishna 
---
Same fell bro 
---
that was fast
---
Magnificent
---
It'd be funnier if I didn't knew Spanish. But it's still a good meme my guy. 
---
I am opening all the boxes to get as much gold  as I can because I have an almost maxed account
---
Yay a gene skin
---
you can definitely get the epic ones for that much money. rest would be tough. if you seriously didn't get any then you are really unlucky.
---
How do you get the brawler next to your name?
---
Gasp :0
---
The colors are really amazing. Your skins look better than supercells tbh 
---
XV4FGR8 that’s my room
---
Well buy shop legendary brawlers, you can get all 3 for 50 dollars plus about 10 saved up gems
---
First thing I'm spanish, so I'm sorry if I  make a spelling mistake. I wanna ask you if you are thinking in create a 1vs1 mode, my idea is doing 3 rounds, at the end of one you can change the brawler and the winner is who wins two. Please think about it😘
---
Pd: I LOVE your game
---
Pams teaming is the biggest form of being weak as a player
---
Spend your money better
---
how do you calculate your chances?
---
Cool! Thanks for letting me know! 
---
3200 isint even that high
---
that doesnt have to mean anything, just saying
---
If they can make it work then we’ll see. But yes, it will take time to adjusf
---
It's not about skins it's about getting legendaries, not all people have the same luck but I think this is just too unfair, that some random at 700 can get a legendary in a brawl box for free and I who I spent 200€ and I am at 6000 trophies can't find one, also I know there are players in worse situatuons than mine, like 10K no legendary, this is so unfair. 
---
This might be my favourite skin of yours. Love Gene and love your work dude!! Keep it up!! 
---
yes , I have this skin it is so cool
---
What I do is have brock be my star token farmer, I keep him at zero trophies so I don't lose any
---
People on my friend's list always ask why I refuse to play SD. This...this is why.
---
I won't spend any more money on this game I'm tiredq
---
It works for mobile lmao, I’m on mobile
---
139 gems? That’s a lot, holy cow! I’ve been playing since global release and have 31
---
- character personality
---
+ player personality
---
Thier is 3 dots in the top left click that then click choose flare then choose crow
---
You can join SVS top player 
---
If this is real I hope they at least make an option for people who want to play with today’s 3d
---
ok can we just play without voice cuz ur making me scream out loud ,,TOO PRETTY FOR PAIN''
---
What would the nerf be? Shotgun Brawlers would really be no fun to play and would just not be used as often due the tweaking of auto aim,I do understand Auto Aiming Problem for Brawlers like Colt cuz he can rip right thru you if he hits all of his shots

That’s how mafia works 
---
Ew crow
---
Don’t team in the first place
---
Who the hell wants to depend on a team in order to play only a few times?
---
r/crowgang that’s a deal from us if you wanna take it
---
Oh shit oh fuck
---
I know I have him at power 6 and it does 450 dmg per dagger.
---
Crow needs a buff.👍
---
Totally. It's a shame too because I would totally buy this skin if it were like 10 dollars max, but there's no way I'm spending the kind of money they're asking, just out of principle alone. 
---
I still don’t get it
---
Autofire almost made me quit... after playing since the beginning, I had become fluent in the old control system, and then, suddenly, I was terrible...
---
Suscribe plz

Spike saw something he liked.

Woah dude sick! (I am mister_x_21 of u remember)

Penny and Jessie have the same health and range, and they both have a turret, I was just wondering.
---
If this happens anyone want my account cuz imma uninstall. I'm at 8.6 I have all brawlers expect Mortis and gene 
---
Don't be such a sourpot, I'm sure OP appreciates the constructive criticism and advice. Just because he did it for free doesn't mean that he doesn't want to get better at it.
---

I cry more and more when you post nice skins that won't be in game 😥
---
coz bush
---
Kro
---
Yeah, but it would be a lot of work for Supercell, because they'll have to change all of the character animations in game
---
That monstrosity did 9/11?
---
I got the level 5 pack instead pf that, but it costs real money when it should be fReE
---
nah, don't worry
---
Yeah it applies for everyone. It's a global offer I guess. I don't know what happens to those who already have it but I don't so I got the offer as well.
---
My game doesn't work anymore after the maintenance break today, I get stuck at the screen where it asks to play with or without supercell-ID. Does somebody know what to do?
---
yay another way to down my legendary odds
---
Those Batteries Give Him More Energy To Spin Much Faster!!!

There is NOTHING wrong with having Ike as a name

She's a turreteer.
---
I’d love a skin of the old dynamike design.
---
Leon Op gg,Literally anybody that has a Super that helps their movement is gg
---
Just saying...If you had shot the brock instead of the primo you probably would have killed him. 
---
Lol exactly
---
How many trophies do you have and what was your legendary chance when you got him?
---
Who said he could get better at it ? It's like I come to you and notice every grammatical mistake u make. That's annoying.

enter that and do whatever it says
---
Makes nita
---
This is beyond science
---
Well it is noy the randoms fault... if ure playing with randoms and u are at high enough trophies with that brawler (300 and above) the randoms arent bad... its just that they chose wrong brawlers (piper in bb or poco in bounty) 
---
It happened to me but with Tara And Mortis In one big box.
---
Lucky u Have Gene
---
When you found Shelly hiding in that bush
---
I Can't understand anything its not english
---
How is this man not hired yet?
---
Thanks for the answer!
---
She is ranged, has the highest dps in the game at close range, her attack is impossible to dodge, she has a lot of hp, her reload speed is pretty fast and her super throws a turret that heals her over time for as long as she wants to, and her star power heals her while she attacks. 
---
Also, there are 1-6 Pams in every single Showdown match, and if they all team up against you (because they really like teaming) you're doomed. Why wouldn't I think she is OP?
---
That can never happen for me cause of shot delay 
---
That brock could have won if he started to get closer to piper
---
Soon is like never
---
Do i need to enter my phone? :/
---
Yeah so umm...how many days did it take to do this again?
---
Phoenix skin is "the offer" for everyone. those who don't have crow get a chance to unlock it along with skin.
---
U gotcha!!

---
1 day, from idea to recreation 
---
yep..see if u avoid teaming..in a theoretical way..thats the first thing u should do..but but but..then be ready to not win(ofc u would win sometimes)..so the best thing is..team..but not with intention of teaming..team and when u get a chance to kill him..like if he is injured a little..then kill him..
---
dont die, play a brawler that fit's the map. Try to learn which brawlers you can win a 1v1 against. Play all your brawlers to earn more xp and dont just focus on 1.
---
These tips works for me and i am maxed out at 11,2 K :-) 
---
Good luck. 
---
Well, atleast you can push Pam easily...
---
It's possible, but I heard it's really difficult for this to happen
---
oh is that so..your sarcasm skills are poor boy
---
Tara isn’t weak, are you dumb?
---
It would be cool if they changed his super animation from a hand to a fish with this skin.
---
I started at global and reached 4K this morning 
---
We love you Gedi
---
For teaming? yes
---
4K buddies!
---
r/wooosh
---
Good to know ty
---
That is why i dont play siege
---

---
Krl, o otro time ta ferrado 😅
---
That would be really fucking awesome. But SC should look out that no attack animation looks like the attack had a smaller hitbox or anything like this
---
4.2k don't have any legendaries
---
Finally! 
---
Amazing as always.
---
Although the image could be improved, the idea is pure gold! Great work!
---
I’m not dumb just I’m staying in solo showdown and I’m trying to destroy the power box for more than 15 seconds and most of the time someone come and stealing it and killing me
---
Ahhh, alright, I think I get it :)
---
Buff
---
It's reverse time! XD
---
No hat mortis is better imo
---
Is that the android beta (i really dont know plz help)
---
I don't mind. I got leon from one casual small box and not from a box opening.

Nice artwork. Then I saw Spike... still awesome artwork ;)

Jessssssssie please !

---
OH , new skin
---
I don’t have any legendaries rip
---
I mean he really close to me so I prob not going to do damage. Even though panic in that time
---
The homie colt
---
I gotta say ucazo is right for the most part for people like shelly and bull (and maybe some tanks), using auto aim is good for when you are up close. I have tried the strategy of flick to shoot and i personally hate it with bull (but with medium-long range heroes its good) because i want to get in, get as many shots in as possible, then use super to back off with a kill. I hoped i helped, and if i didnt, piss off
---
I can :P  
---
What color ?  
---
Yep youre right
---
Want colt ? What color ?
---
I don’t know who to ask, so I’m asking you since you may know about it
---
do you know if it’s available on iPhone? I’ve tried finding it but have had no luck 
---
Wow nice dodging. Also really bad aim on their part.
---
You do to need have crow to be in the r/crowgang 
---
when does carl come out?

Tara is in a very good spot right now

He doodoo
---
Mhm... what about a deep red like her hairs ?
---
I imagine blue/light blue would look the best
---
Remind me Subnautica because of this skin
---
Just because a Brawler has a good toolkit doesn't mean he/she deserves a nerf. Once the Brawler gets nerfed, maxed players along with other players who enjoy playing with them, are going to complain and we are going to have a buffcrow part 2. Its a vicious cycle. 
---
Jessie in general is good in a lot of modes, notably Gem Grab and Brawl Ball but nothing a little bit of skill and planning can't overcome.
---
I know some me at 16,000 who is missing leon and spike. His name is WinD, he is on pretty much all leaderboards top 25

Hey good job on lv 9 frank

El Ricardo Primo
---
Yep you are right about it I'm just telling the numbers
---
Top 10 reaches recorded in human history
---
I hate when it happens: meteors lock-targetting a brawler and another brawler chasing it. No matter who (me or any other person), it infuriates me seeing it.
---
This is not humor. This is a serious discussion topic.
---
That's all it will take to take him to power 9.  That and 2050 gold

Wooooow! 🍆🍆🍆

So cuuuuute art

I hope you will add race cars

Okay :D

I'm making another one rn, so i'll tell you when it's done.

just pretend only Brawl Stars exist

it still says it expired
---
Thank you all guys for upvoting and commenting

btw I love the game this is just humor

A mix of the two :D

Making another on rn, will tell you when i'm done :P

They bringing fpp soon then lol 
---
Ok *snap* this is epic
---
well at least the teamers died, which is the moral of the story
---
Scusatemi ma Leon lo avete fatto diventare schifoso!! Dobbiamo arrivare che ogni shuriken tolga 1 di danno??? È diventato troppo scarso

(Traducete in italiano)

Very good

80 trophies at power level 10? Wow

Tara can be a lot better with a little more damage and faster reload time
---
   To go 
---
Sounds good
---
are you trying to push tara on showdown? Lmao
---
I lose so many games to this. 
---
Yea it deels so short ago
---
Oh..I feel sad for you

i'll surely use light blue for skin and blue for clothes
---
I see youre a man of culture as well
---
Woah...It's ok hell get them eventually
---
Gene is very good
---
This is what every shelly user expects when they say "shelly is the best brawler" but cant even ult twice in a row
---
team r/woooosh
---
The moment you open a brawl box, whatever you get is already added to your account (gems, power points, brawlers etc). The remaining is all animation. 
---
Crow is bad
---
If that's the angle you play from, how the hell are you supposed to use Piper?
---
Look how they massacred my boys
---
#IT'S ALMOST OVER 900,000

---
Oh.
---
ok lets try something else
---
Yes but my friend only have 1200 and he had 14/23
---
That isn’t racism lol
---
Phoenix Crow, I think this is the same to everyone
---
Hey thanks! I’m not the one who made it tho the artist’s name is in the title
---
Open the boxes it will boost youre super rare chance and you will get pheonix crow
---
r/comedyheaven 
---
I'm at 23/23 brawlers so no brawler or skin offer for me as I already have pheonix crow skin.  I have Bo star power for 169 gems.
---
Is this some sort of joke I am to skilled to understand?
---
Playing with nerve out
---
Crow movement speed are decent
---
Li-la vi sinty zi lu (crow =op) and those are not even words

Thank you pal :DDD

Thanks Gedi! :)

It’s derogatory and insulting
---
I call it playing with soiled pants. 💩🤯
---
;)
---
Haha nice one bud
---
Exactly or supers that can make others move faster or go in the air are op
---
It’s 5% of the original level 1 stats to the current stats
---
Not true, all Xiaomi phones (except the A series which have no MIUI) come with a recording app that captures sound. Whatever app you're currently using is complete garbage, if it can't even do something as simple as that. My sister who doesn't have a Xiaomi usés "DU Recorder", she says it's the best one. Maybe try that one?
---
Nice art! Also I posted a leon custome (bunny leon) can u look.
---
It might be insulting but racism isn’t insults. Racism is putting one race over the other races. Even though it was offensive I still found it slightly clever. 
---
I started at soft launch in Russia (3 days before global) and got 4k 2 days ago.
---
**Insert generic where is he phrase here**
---
Nice job my dude!
---
That sounds like work.  I ain't gonna..
---
Lol why didn't u just use the gems on legendary offers? 
---
This cheers me up since Ive been on a losing streak 38 loses in a row and counting with rank 15 brawlers and i had to call a special hotline to stop me from bungie jumping of a bridge...
---
Nerf. Actually.
---
Aight just sayin’ all the credit goes to the guy who made it
---
I just found this pic on google and I thought it would be nice to share it to other people
---
It could be made like that on purpose
---
Honestly I’m the crowgang leader and I think the price for crow is out rages but if you already have crow and you see this offer his skin is 209 gems witch is a deal but for the legendary it’s a lot of money
---
I know rip
---
I play zombs 2 
---
Not at all but I’m trying to have some trophies from her.I unlock Tara yesterday and it’s my first mythic brawler
---
I ain’t u though 
---
 Yes... YES... r/crowgang FTW!
---
Now we have to spy check, that's just great.
---
Carl actually may be somewhat good
---
It means that the 5th box you open gives you a rare brawler (there are more but I don'know what box?)
---
IT WORKED FINALLY but ur still not responding :p
---
AMAZING 🙌
---
The bottle she is holding...
---
Looks like the pills that give like 25% hp from Team Fortress 2...

No?

Wowee
---
Job well done, Mac! You must be good at arts!
---
Im at 3.5k trophies and don't have an epic wtf
---
I do use DU Recorder with my phone but i dont think it records in-game sounds,also not all android phones have a built in recording system,some do and some dont have.

Thanks guys for feedback

Cursed comment
---
Pam made a deal with the devil to be all powerful
---
Right. The racism lies in the fact that someone expressed their thoughts in a language other than English, and someone else felt the need to put them down because of that. I came out a little strong in my original comment, but I find the joke derogatory and not funny.

Everyone want a crow buff bruh

Please don’t ever do this😭😭😭😭
---
Ok nice...
---
I was saving them for Carl but then I won a giveaway so I have enought gems to buy him
---
The worst part about this game is allowing premade teams to match against random teams. Of course, everyone that only plays with friends/clan will disagree because they like winning.
---
Siege mode needs a lot of work. It is very unbalanced.
---
That said, I’ve never run into a 10 power opponent. Seems like your bad luck or an exaggeration.

---
In one big box!?
---
Mortis gang too
---
Wtf did you bring upon this cursed land?
---
Can you fix the shot delay in your game? Usually it happens from the beginning of the match throughout the match. Now it happens literally in the middle of the match which annoys me even more.
---
Because you're poor
---
I like it personally
---
Killer = game over
---
I would buy the crap outta this skin
---
what the heck are there so many furries?!
---
It's a bit like crow but other than it it looks like an amazing idea! Awesome drawing.
---
Anal beads
---
as a person who likes to abuse people with a layer of dynamikes attacks, this is weird

He better use the spike to its potential
---
Dude I have enough gems but the skin ruins it for me, what do you think? Plus I’d rather have leon.

---
Cowboy Colt
---
No because those little boxes push up your rates for getting a brawler. 
---
It's in you.
---
Cawwwwwwwww
---
Are you planning putting in tbe future some kind skin for leon.?
---
Hey Gedi I know this is probably really out of the blue but I have you ever thought about designing csgo skins?
---
There is a lot more completion but I think you have a lot of talent for this kind of stuff 
---
Actually she will.
---
6500 trophies and my chance was 0.2
---
I have all 23 brawlers but my spike is level 1 and I have a few other low levels like lvl5 crow and level 4 gene
---
Amazing sakura
---
I agree now because it boosts my drop rates as well as possibly getting Carl then getting power points in mega box 
---
Thank you!!! 
---
Oh go choose flair from settings I believe
---
Probs when the update comes out after carl
---
He is drax
---
i mean i do max brawler trophies one at a time cuz its easier than doing it all at once (ps i know how to play its my alt)
---
The guys face when he laughs is hilarious
---
#Jaiden
---
How are none of these are put in the game by supercell they are so good wtf
---
Skins are cool but skill is much more important, I don't have that xd. Maybe, some day you will get it :D
---
Princess+Sniper = Piper
---
Lol, He is in my club! Didn't know even Indians are there even though it's a US based club and most are of US like me! Gonna ask the leader to kick him out!
---
I'm not sure what you mean by draw information, but all I pulled was power points and that's it if that helps. I ended up psending another $100 and getting nothing again... I decided to stop spending money on the game entirely, I realized it's for the best.
---
16 but ok
---
I need Leon's hoodie. I'm serious
---
Not my proudest fap.
---
Dude am amazed by the amount of effort and dedication you put into creating these. Awesome work!!

No ^^

Use it if you want :3

Spike does massive damage and if you’re a good shot then you can hit people with him.
---
Have a BRAWLtasic birthday! And you got a BRAWLtasic luck!

(plz help)

OMG! SHE POOPS BOOMBS
---
Leon
---
Then they’ll like maintenance break and I’m like alright sick imma get my tickets....NOPE 
---
Welp, I found Leon.
---
Honestly it’s a great track, and Milos just makes it strangely entrancing 👀
---
I did manage to get my free chest after a few try’s 
---
I love the loaded Rico skin
---
No way this is going to be real in-game player view.
---
And I tought I was gambling my 3 karma points by posting this. I haven’t seen any complaints about her other than the Showdown stuff, do you think the devs will adress the issue?
---
More! Please sensei!!!
---
I just had another great idea for a buff.
---
Currently, his super is charged by his daggers and the poison inflicted and charges much faster at close range because you are hitting them with all 3 daggers, the problem is charging it at long range which takes a very long time even with poison chip. 
---
Heres my proposed solution
---
Instead of he daggers charging his super only the poison charges it, but it also charges much faster. With this change crow will be able to charge his super very quickly from long range with the poison chip won’t be able to spam it like shelly when he gets close up because the daggers themselves no longer charge. Something similar to this can be done to fix shelly as well, since she charges her super very slowly at long range but can spam it when she gets close, instead of all 5 shots from her shotgun charging her super have 1 shot be “special” this single shot will be the one to charge her super, this way it charges at the same rate at both long and short range, this means supercell can lower the amount of hits it needs to charge so she’ll be able easily charge her super from long range by hitting the single special shot while no longer being able to spam it when hitting all 5 
---
How much is he without the skin? 
---
But he will drop other chances that were saved up for months.
---
If you want to watch the anime it’s called ‘one punch man’
---
Your right!

I really don't like them!
---
That is fixed with the update :)
---
Damn i hope they consider adding it great job
---
Even if SuperCell only gets permission to use his concepts as inspiration, that'd still be awesome. The nature of fan art is to share ideas, isn't it? Great artwork here!

I'm offended by this. Why are people assuming it's gender...

Very good idea

Yoooooo supercell if you add this skin I’ll pay any amount of gems for it amazing job

The season lowers your trophies and i forgot that it wasent 4 days it was 8

Your second reason seems valid, give them nothing, but then you need a detection system that has to be very accurate

 Katakusu : put a tournament or competitive mode in the game so you do not have to play on non-professional websites and when you play the tournaments they give you a prize depending on the position in which they stay and they are played in all the way

Depends on the game mode, for showdown i got him to 200 with level 1 then he became too weak and got him to 6 which is kinda good but nothing special
---
Yupp thats what sucks
---
Idk, i started playing in early january
---
So F-ing true!
---
No, unfortunately i never opened a mega box
---
is it a bad time to say i’m hard
---
Ou you want the realy bad Time 😉
---
Omg ,my chance on legendary is 0.1440 :0
---
Would the bull over the bridge before it collapsed or would he just stop as it gets destroyed in front of him??

You mean teaming time

Now how about four pams at once

OH MY... GOOOOOOODDD
---
&gt;If primos worked like that, he wouldn’t be able to super the bridge at all.
---
It says if he lands on the edge
---
What is this "lore" you speak of?
---
That's so cool! Good job! 
---
you really don't need to downvote. its actually harder than you think for a maxed out account.
---
Supercell saw your post.
---
Yepp true but still annoying ":D
---
Ok...nevermind then.
---
No, it’s not 😂, I’m maxed out and I did this 3 times in a row earlier, you just need a good team comp 
---
Fun fact: That account is not maxed out.
---
Yep just split the water and place walls there
---
dude. i had to deal with a lot of stupid randoms. I titled so much on every other brawler
---
xD
---
Go to shop. Click a mega box. Click the info button. 
---
Just take the upvote you cheeky bastard.
---
I heard on Youtube that there was a competition for brawl stars maps (I think it's still ongoing), and one of the rules was that the map shouldn't have 1 tile spaces, I guess someone like Frank and El Primo might be a occupying more than one tile. So definitely widen the bridge. 
---
Adding a third bridge I'm not so sure.
---
duck me that is cool
---
How’s level 1 crow?
---
Discounted token doublers even better
---
Not me, I love it
---
Sorry what makes it unplayable
---
Germany tank Ratti 14 000kg
---
I don’t understand what you are saying. My point is he wouldn’t be able to destroy the whole bridge.
---
Look at my profile and look at the improved map of this!
---
You’ve got to be kidding me 
---
Great 2012 font 
---
Oh I know the feeling of dealing with randoms 
---
I can't, I tried. Well if I'm not gonna get them soon I think I'll uninstall anyways, it just makes me angrier. 
---
The switch is selling good btw. But yeah it would be cool. But you couldn't play outside without hotspot.

HO LY SHIT

Yeah true but it would be too hard

r/CrowGang ftw

It’s not unfair though, matchmaking is based on trophies so if they are level 10 but 250 trophies they’re probably not that good so you should have a chance

yeah.

"Sea Gene" flows better

I'm tired of all these people posting "oMg I got leOnCroWaNdSPiKe"

Did well with Crow and Poco before,
---
Repost. We don't forget posts that quickly.
---
No Barley is fine, he‘s my fav Brawler and in my opinion he is better than Dynamike. Dynamike is easier to dodge, because of the explosion delay. 
---
Good for you 😊😁
---
Happy birthday 
---
They remade everything with a reason, it turned out amazing in my opinion
---
Whats the original comic?
---
I am desperate to make the re-make famous!
---
What Bull and El Primo players can do in showdown? Switch their brawler.
---
The solution is for you to fall into the water and move slowly (like Spike's super) and take damage over time until you get out of the water. To get out, you just approach an edge of the water and your character just gets out. You can't manually re-enter the water.
---
What's this meme with dynamike spinning 
---
This would further strain the mm process and also seems as though it’d be rather easy to exploit. 
---
Superrare shouldn't be so hard to unlock.. the chance is around 1-2%. High for a new brawler. Of course I don't expect him in the first 10 boxes but like I said it should be fast
---
Because I do not get any brawler for a long time.
---
yes you will , but you wont know what brawler you have untill you enter the game , if i use a random num generator then i know what brawlers i am going into the mode with
---
I see you’re a fellow terrarian as well
---
It would probably move him to the nearest land
---
!!english
---
But it's honestly fucked up and is an exploit. It basically shows how much you suck at the game
---
Mommy mommy give me 50$$ for this mobile game please!
---
*gets disowned* (hopefully)
---
You fall into the water and move slowly until you escape the water, and also you take a little damage over time until you escape.
---
It's fitting. In the bag she transports the healing station and above that she stores her scrap to prevent you from healing
---
You probably got all of them through teaming didn't you
---
r/whoosh
---
Damn nice, but not as nice as sexy mortdyna
---
It’s not impossible, you won the game which proves it. 
---
Maybe juuust maybe you won this match. But idk
---
Hello partner:)
---
They had recently released an offer for Leon. Do you remember how many gems it was? I want to aim for that now.
---
Yup, im getting this matchups more and more. Once we played against all 3 of them lvl 10
---
Yea my chance is high so If I don't get him in the first 2 weeks he's released welp.
---
30 dollar should be enough but no Supercell of course wants 50 dollar. Yeah he has skin bit a skin has no value. The skin should be work as a bait like the trade tokens from CR. Greedy SC. 
---
Gene. Ez wins here tio
---
How’s it an exploit when supercell day it’s within the rules? I don’t think it should be a part of the game either, but it is now. It doesn’t make sense NOT to team. 
---
Your going to tell me you wouldn’t if everyone else in ur match was? For the sake of moral dignity? Until the rules are changed I see no problem with teaming. 
---
Dude, this is just phenomenal! The art looks real af and the concept is really nice. Extremely well done!
---
they are going to give a buff to crow in the next? 
---
Lol, it’s funny how many people ask that same question!
---
Ok I agree on how to exit, but why take damage tho is what I'm curious about?
---
Because people could cheese the mode then.

So that players can't camp inside the water, thus being too well-protected from players not in the water. You drown if you stay in the water, basically. So you're compelled to escape asap.
---
Yeah, but this happens every game mode too.
---
Bo is everywhere
---
He said penny in 1st message but second message i don't know
---
Crow, his poison is op
---
otherwise you could just camp in the water and nobody could reach you because they can't jump in the water too
---
But why
---
ITS. PERFECT. I AM SPEECHLESS. STAY AWESOME AND IDK WHY I AM STILL TYPING IN CAPS AAAAAAAAAAAAA
---
horrible im trying
---
to push my fresh gene which is pretty autistic lol to reach 6,5k and tryna play in a fun gamemode but always bo is so frustrating thanks new players at 3k 🤬🤬🤬
---
You misspell "then" and "if you roblox"and you call me a baby?Watch Your English
---
Plus Many adults play brawl stars
---
 Go do your research..
---
Oh wait....You Dont even know whay research means
---
Ok, how would it work with el primo? You’d be in the water since the bridge brakes under you...
---
Thank you. I appreciate the comment. 
---
Me
---
No I didn't even know spinning means teaming until like 4k
---
12 possibles spawners -.' 
---
wow this is so unpopular
---
r/BoGang 
---
That’s really cute! - r/BoGang
---
Wouldnt that make an infinitlre Darryl toll though like how it was so his roll would be really long
---
What the hell is wrong with the billion cacti?
---
😋
---
Frank too, unless his hammer comes down on the bridge.
---
I know how u feel. Every match with my new brawlers had a Bo, Bo was always star player, and my teammate Bo is afk. Maybe play Gene in a Bo-less game mod...wait there isn't one. 
---
Good luck!
---
arcade shelly was out like 5 mins ago!
---
also as always great work
---
This looks awesome!
---
The good old days! Still prefer those days over now tbh
---
I always thought she had a 3rd eye she could kind of see the future out of, and she uses the cards she throws to tell fortunes or some shit.. She kinda reminds me of a genie. And honestly speaking when you think of it this way, Tara is more of a genie than Gene is.
---
r/woosh
---
I think it's not russian
---
Thank you!
---
r/shellygang
---
Sounds good! 
---
Depends on the map.
---
pls yes
---
3 top right dots; change user flair. Welcome to the Morti 
---
Go on r/brawlstars. In the top right, there’s three dots. Click them and you’ll find “user flair”
---
How about temporarily disabled bridges?
---
r/swoosh r/swoosh

6000 trophies without any epic, mythic or legend? Really? there are 14 brawlers (without counting epic/mythic/legend) so 6000/14=429 trophies per brawlers... hard to believe. if it's true I'm desperate (currently 14 brawlers, 3.5k trophies and I begin to think the game play with my nerves...)
---
sweet home alabama
---
But wouldn't the player in the water become an easy target since it moves slowly? Other players would probably be able to reach him
---
Amazing drawing^^ one of the best i have seen in a wilee give credits to your friends this is awesome^^
---
Finally u put a string! 
---
Ok ok I get you
---
It is
---
Oooh, good theory! I always tought Tara was a gypsy sent from the void to brawl for watever reason Supercell will impliment. 
---
Calm down!
---
Carl's pickaxe was actually an in tune used Poco guitar until he threw it, which made it out of tune.
---
He's just making it back in tune.
---
/s
---
Looks more like an El Primo skin than a new brawler. They could make him look more hood like you know, some grills, heavy ass chains, saggy jeans... lol maybe you should draw this bro, I'm no artist.
---
2.5684%
---
Sure doesn't really apply to Poco. I've been playing a lot of Rico and Barley lately, and have really learnt to be downright scared of him. Four hits and he will end you, I got backstabbed by one as Rico, I used my super and I still died. Also, it won't just be two-people teams. Often it's six or seven people spinning.
---
Currently no epic, mythic or legend, I'm 3.5k trophies. Yeah, you're lucky, or at least much much more lucky than me.
---
Looks amazing^^ great jobe dude keep goingg this is awesome
---
Well... Darryl lucky  o.o
---
Well you make your own map so we will se witch is better.
---
What the hell did you make this with? It's so perfect!
---
i played one more game and litterally im tilting the game i was gene and the only person who wasn’t a bo was a mortis
---
U got that
---
When at 400+ the only things you want to dodge are throwers, Bull, Shelly, and El Primo. Leon will happily take all the help he can get, and Crow and Spike get three-shotted by everything. 
---
Well done mate. Would buy 10/10
---
Partly me
---
You mean the meme with like 1.3k upvotes, which is the same thing as this except with shelly?
---
What i said was a joke too man but you can’t really tell if someone is being sarcastic or not online
---
Yes: Spike's eyes.
---
0.0336 The F brawl stars!
---
Thank you. I appreciate the comments!
---
I play a weird mix of brotherhood and dominant then. I always end up with 5 more power cubes than my buddies, wait for them to start busting up on each other, and then it's win time.
---
Yup
---
If you like duos, I think you should play with a friend or club member using higher ranked brawlers so matchmaking would place you with higher brawlers. Hopefully less Bo
---
😰 why?
---
I am f2p but i will buy him i have 51 gem and frank said he will be in shop special offer with decreased price
---
O____0
---
This meme still going?
---
I feel u
---
I’m at 5,300 trophies with no legendaries and a 0.1920 chance 🙃
---
I say 4 or 5. Anything underdog like Mortis, Jessie, Piper and Poco go from there to actually start being dangerous. Otherwise they're just a joke player.
---
yeah i know usually i do that because im in a french top 30 band but i just wanted to play chill after work and yeah great game supercell lol
---
no wayyyyy 
---
I like it, I think an alien skin would be most fitting considering his abducting power
---
You misspell "what", plus only adultes who plays roblox and 'some' babies. You're still a baby so you have a lot of stuff to explore in your life. I don't wanna waste my time with a sucker.
---
When that second movie came out I dropped all my plans just to go see premier. Worth it!
---
Stolen Art 😪
---
What joke? He really needs that legendary.
---
I mean how do I get that feeling? it's just not the same...
---
Well, when the bad touch hand grabs the boomstick abuser who happens to have their Super Shell ready to use. I'm pretty sure the demented angry bird Will Smith will have a bad time.
---
We must all give up teaming to make the game more fun.
---
Depends on what is much for you?
---
I watch jaiden animations and i really like her ari, if this skin aas in the game i would uss it
---
But *cough cough* i need croa firs
---
I gotta admit,I have teamed for shits and giggles but I don't double team people I just carry them and make sure they get to 2nd place possibly take shots for them 
---
get a second account
---
Tara best girl
---
Do you mean heist
---
Gene doesn't need changes
---
Cuz why no xd
---
Darryl = O2
---
Hm... you activated my trap card
---
r/iamverydumb
---
Wow a shitty comic and 600+ upvotes.. while i spe nt more time trying to make a good one and it didn'y even pass 100...
---
SHOW ME YOUR WAR FACE!
---
# power core
---
Nah, they have different skin color.
---
Its so funny how they both just stood there and for her to get close.
---
I posted that
---
You’d think that, but I have 6324 trophies and 17 brawlers. I’ve been playing since beta too
---
His hand special should be a shark biting the opponent.
---
well this is a really original idea.
---
EEEEEL PRIMOOOOOO!
---
Nookio
---
CUTE
---
but normally green 
---
Spike and pam
---
Damn can't wait for kids to spam like 10000 fake reports. 
---
thanks dood, just did one with it c:
---
She could suck a dick instead of that candy :P
---
This should be the top post of all time. Easily.
---
Wooosh
---
Something to cure it

I enjoyed those 4 minutes

Awesome skin as always😎
---
Stay away from my niece!!!
---
They used a patched matchmaking exploit.
---
Every teamer ever
---
How do you play in Pc? It's a emulator?
---
Thanks! It took me around 15 minutes to make it.
---
Why the machmaking is very unfair 
---
Here birdie birdie 
---
Not only does your art look awesome they're super unique. I would have never thought of an Aqua Gene.
---
Add a dances menu and I'm done.

Pls yes

0.009 😭

I like to bait someone with a spin and see how close they let me get to them.
---
Then I kill them.
---
Lucky Spike
---
There's still this glitch were Mortis has some lipstick on and looks really bad. Please could you fix this glitch? It really hurts my eyes to look at.
---
If you have a bad network don't play multi-player games.
---
Yep the world turns to you like africa in the 19th century
---
My friend spent £60 on brawl stars today.  And I’m worried about 2
---
Battie battie*
---
As a hat simulator guy, I Approve of this idea.
---
Oh god . Those meteors . You cant without a fucking meteor shower everywhere you walk 
---
Down voted for teaming 
---
I think it’s a turban
---
Ocean man take me by the hand lead me to the land
---
Since this post became a thing
---
Took me a sec to realize there was a veil covering her face (and not just bad white balance washout editing), but after that...pretty good.  Nice work.
---
Maybe there could be a trimming piece or piping around the edges of the veil to let it stand out more...?
---
Upvote this post if you want more icons
---
Ok damm chill. Bye
---
This is cool
---
Hey it’s a team of 15 people you can’t blame them

Holy crap this is awasome

Needs less healing p/s

It Remembers me to Kylo Ren. From Star Wars.
---

---
Literally my brawl stars life...
---
Thank you! 🤩
---
Hope some developer see this, it's the dream brawler 
---
NP bb 😘
---
Not really, Mike has many hardcounters right now. Pam on the other hand is the best Brawler in the game.
---
Please no. 
---
52 
---
Resch 3000 trophies then
---
It was actually available for free for me. It looks so much better than default one 😉
---
Been playing from day 1 of beta launch 
---
We need a Star Lord Colt
---
BOOM BOX BRICK LMAOOOO
---
Yes... keep going.
---
Yeah the skin was free if you played it in 2018 but I am curious how many people did
---
Baich
---
Ravioli ravioli please lewd the fucking loli
---
It's no shit Sherlock, DoNT bE A SiSsY!
---
Hella funny 
---
At first i thought Spike was just the holes created by the bombs
---
Is it based on Void Termina? ;)
---
You never heard of a retuning pickaxe? It was used by lumberjacks in the 19th who had to walk long distances to get to the tree they were cutting down and they would use pickaxes which they could retune and repair without walking all the way back to their cabins. 
---
I don’t think you understood that I have 2 legendary’s but all I wanted was bo :|
---
Damn, i think i’d like tara beter than Gena tbh
---
#Leona
---
I wondered about this too! Supercell games have always been really popular, and the switch already has some “apps” as download only games. However, I don’t know if Nintendo would do it or if the joysticks would provide an unfair advantage
---
yuck
---
This is a good idea but I see a few problems:
---
•Shelly and colts super doesnt make sense to break the bridge since it's on the ground
---
•What would happen if someone triggered bo's bombs while on the bridge? If the bomb was right in the center of the bridge the knockback wouldnt be a big enough knockback to push a brawler completely off the bridge. (This problem could happen with basically any super)
