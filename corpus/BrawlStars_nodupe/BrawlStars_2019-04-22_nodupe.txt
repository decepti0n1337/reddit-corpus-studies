Oh yeah what up bro? Let‚Äôs play some gem grab later on today?
---
Peeps
---
I mean it depends on the map and where they're at. He's got the range yeah but if there's a wall between em Shelly can super and take his lunch money
---
Same with Mortis
---
Lol
---
Piper should be top
---
Well, I just don‚Äôt know what to say, thank you üôèüèΩ

Wendy's

She didn‚Äôt pick it up

I have 20 out of 24 at 4.7k

/woooosh
---
I would watch this show!
---
A power 10 jessie, power 10 pam and then 1 other brawler can easily get 6 minutes. Lots of colts or nita, Sometimes frank.

I call em Kirbys

*Gene is not a girl*
---
My idea about penny star power is to replace it with the:
---

---
When penny normal attack hits an enemy it explodes dealing splash damage.
---
Or they can replace it with the:
---
When penny normal attack hits an enemy the bounce of her hit is doubled
---
Can confirm is real
---
*what is lancer doing here*
---
I don‚Äôt think she is. She‚Äôs a fortune teller not a mummy
---
This reminds me of the time I got Darryl from one of these

Yeah? Lucky bro üòÇ

Leon is just a Primo with more range

Wow that's _really cool!_

Yes

Ye i was also surprised when i did it in only an hour. Honestly i was just so hyped when i got him that my drawing sped up like crazy lmao

Ah, I see now. It‚Äôs actually really cool!

Mortis is the creepy janitor

Tara and Jessie, are in the book club and are super tryhard elitists who get 120% on every assignment. Tara in particular is obsessed with harry potter erotica

For reals tho

You‚Äôre never gonna get that Leon

I liked your map! :)

Bruh it‚Äôs all fair. It‚Äôs average trophies of team

Me too

make it yourself

I guess you pladtoad
---
its like that for a reason
---
**BLZ?**
---
Thanks bro
---
I utilized state of the art technology to make this
---
well it's an easy fix
---
Except once we killed all the throwers the Shelly imidiently back stabbed the Nita and I died from the Shelly too
---
Without a common enemy we collapse
---
He has aimbot
---
I think it could go both ways
---
Are we analyzing a meme?
---
i'd rather have trophy gates per rank actually tbh, it would prevent players from getting frustration due to losing 120 trophies or so
---
CALLATE, TU PUTA
---
They could just reduce its reaction speed because the very instant that he is in range of you it will instantly shoot a bullet. Like you could be playing jessie shooting the bot and you run around the corner to heal up and your teammate comes to body block the little shit will just ignore the pam and go around the corner to snipe you

Nobody bullies the Nerd, becuase hes probably a tattletale

Seriously, what are even the odds of getting a legendary from each different box?
---
Thanks for warning me!
---
What's wrong with fast progress? What keeps people playing this kind of game is gameplay and skins... Having access to certain characters is key to having a good experience in some modes... F2P players most of the time feel locked out of content by a pay wall for some months until they get lucky in one of measly 2 blood, sweat and tears grinded free boxes. Doesn't scream player retention to me... I stayed cause I'm stubborn and gave in to a couple of high value gem packs that eased the frustration with some characters.
---
Truer words have never been spoken
---
If you want to see more maps created by me, I would appreciate you to go through my profile and give my maps support because I really try to make them
---
Because they team
---
oh
---
The matches were based on the trophies of the highest brawler on your team. The guy with a 300 barley is what caused the unfair match making
---
What about Kid Kairos?
---
No, they don't and they won't
---
Supercell is a company, and every company wants to incentive players to keep playing constantly, bringing them goals
---
Brawl Stars (and Clash Royale, for example) do this with the levels, players are attracted to play more and keep grinding to get higher level brawlers, and that is how the game works
---
Also, level difference in this game isn't that big tbh, specially when you don't consider star powers
---
And no, they won't change it as they do it purposefully to keep people playing constantly
---
Finally, and honestly, you are just salty and angry, we all can see it, relax, stop crying and get over it. ‚ù§

Your skill needs a buff now.

What's wrong with a curved one?

The joke has to be funny retard :3

You do realize that this app has a "Make Image" button right? It exists for a reason.
---
Oh I assure you it's not my skill
---
and Darryl
---
Guys, don't even bother replying, he is just salty and won't get any argument
---
Let‚Äôs all go downvote the post AND his comments!!!
---
And the worst part of it is, when El Primo respawns, he rushes into the enemy to try to get the gems back, only to be obliterated again.
---
Oh if you think Spike needs a buff then it is.
---
I opened 10 crates at the start and got Leon
---
Leon*
---
Not trying to be rude, but you are just at 4k
---
Spike is easily a top 10 brawler, being good at controlling areas. Also, he can have a big burst damage and chip damage if you learn to aim his attack. It is just your skill, get good
---
Piper
---
Report him this is against the rules
---
Nerf which bot? I missed this one...
---
But Mega Boxes give power points to upgrade things so it is not bad but if you get 30 gem skin you lose 90 gems
---
I guess it's not in the sky if they're islands.
---
Also, a better name would be Skyward Skirmish (just a suggestion).
---
No.
---
(Oh god please don‚Äôt whooosh (4 o‚Äôs) me if this is a joke I‚Äôm trying to help) it‚Äôs probably because the mirror is slightly slanted down. This produces the illusion that the floor is elevated and slanted higher than it should be.
---
I dont have Carl too tho
---
i love you
---
Plantera
---
Dude that's not even a big deal, I've opened 300+ boxes before and gotten not a damn thing. Sometimes it takes a couple boxes and other times it can take 400 boxes lol
---
Bruh üòÇ
---
My best was 6:09 legit
---
The amount of trophies you have doesn't mean shit when it comes to brawler drop rates bud.
---
Trash
---
If y'all hate it, just do it, divide each skin by price and make different Cosmetic boxes.
---
My Power 5 spike at 300 trophies can nearly overpower Primo, I don‚Äôt think Spike needs a buff
---
Maybe the Star Power could be that when Rob summons Poncho, it rushes forward (like Bull) somewhere around 7 tiles. Useful for getting up close to enemies and destroying walls.
---
Im annoyed by that too
---
I'm proud of you my son
---
MMM have my weeb-gamer upvote.

I‚Äôm at 6.1k, I got Carl in 5.9k, and I got it like just last week. Luck shall come to you!

I was at 3600 with 16 brawlers and then an unexpected streak of luck hit me and I got Frank, Piper and Carl in 3 days. 
---
Spike I got around 1700 trophies but I don't play him much as I seem have hp management problems with Spike in solo showdown. I don't have any mythics or other legendaries.
---
Now I wish I would get power points for my new brawlers instead of those that I don't play.

He can kill you without getting closer! Literally, his range it's like 80 tiles.

Nope. 5.2k is nice tooüòâ

I‚Äôm SD do not be aggressive. Try to get boxes and then hide. Use your super only to maneuver through bushed areas and when you can take out brawlers you know you can kill in all three of your salvo blades
---
Wow u got 2 others leggies as well. U so lucky
---
Spike should be in the popular
---
It‚Äôs not that you suck. It‚Äôs just everyone has that time when they are frustrated and it seems like they are loosing every game. It‚Äôs the mindset that‚Äôs most likely making you loose. Not an actual loss of skill

So how do players decide to team with one another? Is it the first set of players to hit the center of the map?

Funny part is that they all have a type of machine/bear to kill you with

Dude, you have to learn wichbrawler is good on wich map. That trophy loss was totally your fault.
---
That mortis was a shame to our morti society...who runs away after getting close to a dynamike?...good thing he died fast..he WS a disgrace....(also NW mortis is not the worst skin...no hat mortis is the worst)
---
Could be super weird
---
WTF BRO
---
Repost :/
---
His Star Power doesn't do anything in Showdown Solo. And that's the biggest flaw.
---
Gene is to 3v3 what Crow is to 1v1. A super annoying brawler, but, he has a super long range (more than Crow) and his super, while it's pretty risky, can just change the whole issue of the battle in 2 seconds.
---
Can't see the texts
---
I think vice versa.
---
*Those thick Eyebrows*
---
He deals 1760 damage in one shot, keep in mind the projectile speed of his shots is ridiculous
---
Now I fucking hate this thing but i don‚Äôt think it needs one. I can still get 6:15 sometimes so I‚Äôm perfectly fine with it being like this cause it means there‚Äôs a challenge
---
Feels sad man
---
Crow didn't need a buff he was just difficult to use, they also said he's a tricky brawler to buff cause if you knew how to use him, he were strong
---
He‚Äôs still only ‚Äúoutperforms‚Äù in showdown. In 3v3s, he‚Äôs only really viable in heist and playable in siege and bounty. For casual players, he‚Äôs a beast. But for pros, he‚Äôs not the best option. I would personally nerf him a tiny bit, but give him indirect buffs, like nerfing pam etc.
---
When you‚Äôre poor af but still wanna show off.

---
99.99% he will inevitably hit you
---
Just because you're teaming up against the person with lots of powercubes, doesn't justify it
---
As Darius has shown us, yes it does
---
Really? All maps is teaming paradise!
---
Crow isn't op, he just super annoying. When a match starts a crow chases you, kills you and dies in the process coming 9th place

The way you comment ‚Äúread my username‚Äù makes it sound like you‚Äôre the evil villain of brawl stars, I love it

Cool

Np ;)

"POSITIVE ELIXIR TRADE INTESIFIES"
---
Why just leon...now even crow will do!!
---
Crow doesn't need a nerf. He did need a small buff for other Modes and there you have it. He might be an S Tier in Showdown but still nowhere else.
---
So handless crow
---
Can't believe how many times i wanted to aim my Super but my Shooting stick went over it and i just shot normally and died.
---
How dare you that 10% damage decrease saved my life like 100 times
---
I'm a girl with really small hands so 60% of the times I want to use a super I end up using a normal attack, I've lost more matches than I care to admit because of this.

He literally has 3 posts, the earliest one was 9 days ago and it just a picture of the trophy road rewards and titled "is bad". His account was also made 12 days ago...

Wish i could have a legendary brawler.

A brawler that is difficult to use is not a well balanced one to me. Especially if other brawlers from the same genre and rarity are way easier and stronger.

Yeah... I dont have any legendary brawlers and Spike is my favorite one!

Nerf them all slightly too!!

So what?

Is it actually funny? üëÄ

Oh hi Sarcasm!

I think reddit doesn't count votes against a user from the same account after a certain amount. I'm also pretty sure votes that are done on the user page don't count at all. You have to click into each post and vote. To prevent people from doing what I assume you did, go to the user page and downvote everything as you scroll down.
---
It's happening since after the update
---
I'd put Frank under "Doesn't know what taxes are" and Dynamike under "Will occasionally forget about taxes" since he probably spends all of his money on dynamite
---
No... It‚Äôs only written you current trophies, not your HIGHEST ones

Spike one would be unbelievably OP and Crow one would be hellish for the enemies if teammates could see them.. but that Leon idea...
---
.
---
Is beautiful.
---
I think they did change the super button configuration to solve the problem a bit, but looks like it still does happen sometimes.
---
You guys wanna discuss which is the worst brawler to be playing with when that happens? My answer would be Piper.
---
I have it too we have an unfair advantage so i don't really care
---
The first two are okay, in my opinion but the red and gold are just crazy

That moat of water actually lies on a hill, known as Moaty McMoatface Hill. So, from your angled perspective parts of the pad are cut off because of the raised terrain.

Oh, I agree he needed a buff. Just stating that I think public opinion and balance changes are bad bed fellows.

117k gold. Okay.
---
Dynamike
---
What about Gene's lamp
---
no that app does that i have it too it shows my tilted brawlers as the rank below

And thats like 260 too much i honestly would be fine with it being 1500 damage so he wouldnt one shot the low health brawlers

Now, Person to person, I‚Äôm not going to tell you to kill yourself just because you stole someone‚Äôs artwork, I think you‚Äôve taken enough bad comments to last a lifetime. But you can change! It‚Äôs not that hard...now, weather you also stole any other content, I don‚Äôt know, but regardless I think you maybe should change and start posting original content. I know that it‚Äôs hard to get a lot of upvotes, but stealing something that pretty much everyone in the community already knows isn‚Äôt yours won‚Äôt help. I would recommend making a new reddit account and start from scratch, making original jokes, or replays, or discussions and such. With enough time, your reputation will grow, and you‚Äôll start being on the trending page.

Solo showdown is getting worser and worser. This map "flying something" is a teamers map
---
Just saying this thread has be dying because you people are arguing and i agree with both, crow did need a bit of a buff, they buffed him just slightly too much. He was underwhelming before, and he didnt fit the desvrpition of "toxic assassin". I agreed with supercell's change

Here I was thinking my 70 was a lot

Well dang, it looks almost identical to the real thing.

He couldn't even see LEON from a brawl box HE OPENED with his hand cuz leon hates kairos

Notifications are typically utilized by developers to act as a one-time prompt to notify the user that something new has occurred or otherwise requires their attention.  It is common practice in most programs/apps for a notification to clear after the user has viewed it.  Or there is at least an option for the user to clear the notification manually.
---
If a notification is unable to be cleared then all future notifications under the same heading tend to lose all importance and urgency.  For instance, if a new notification were to pop up under my "Brawlers" heading I would most likely ignore it assuming that it was part of the existing (16) notifications that have been sitting there for months, unable to be checked off.

Yes but there are hundreds of other games on the store and if newcomers can't get into brawl stars they'll just download another game, and I'm sure supercell prefers millions of potential newcomers play their game than some existing players get a little more satisfaction

I'm really not bothered if people get the best Brawlers on their mini at very low trophies; but in their main.... oooohhhhhhh

That is me today

Looks like im not only one who is doing that with gene

It was probably a new person playing with his friends

it has nothing to do with satisfaction.  it's just bad game design. it's not fair in any way that someone can just win an engagement by tapping his screen because he was playing a shotgun brawler. aiming at close range is a thing in video games don't try to deny it

hi guys i have been playing for a long time with brawl stars about 4 snows and unfortunately one thing i can't get a lot of fun with. there are minimum epic characters and unfortunately I have already done everything to open at least 1 epic brawlers but unfortunately I have not opened anything and I am already 4350 couples

same i look at his account and not only is he a teamer he is also P2W i mean im not faulting anyone for spending money on something they like but its just annoying people like this are privileged the toxic way they handle themselves

Gene I don't think is a sniper.  When I think of sniper I'm thinking of a lot of damage over a long distance.  Genes can hit far, but for very little damage.  His Max damage is honestly mid range, leaning towards close range.  His super can attack far but only services to bring a brawler closer (the opposite of what a sniper class would want).  Spike is weird to me.  His damage is very inconsistent.  If you stand on top of someone (allowing more spikes to hit) you can do 2500+ damage a shot, but from far away it can be a small 300+.  Unless the spike ball hits the target with 1+ spikes then you are 1500+.  She really functions like gene in that she does more damage the closer the brawler, although she has one of if not the lowest health and genes in middle of the pack.  Spike health is 3360 and genes is about 5k.  When you think of spikes super it's really a trap to control others and to health yourself.  I would classify Gene and spike more as a skirmisher for there versatility.  There main attacks are mainly mid range, but they can lightly poke people around corners.  Both of their supers are area denial.  When I break those 2 brawlers down they start to sound more like Tara and bow.  I'd actually make a new class all together for Tara, bow, gene, and spike.  Since there supers are area control and they all really have a mid range shot as a main attacks.  They all function to serve others too.  Bows vision helps teammates, genes healing helps others as well as trap grabbing brawlers from escape, Tara's and spikes help to area deny people.  Lol sorry about the long rant.

If you go in showdown, stay in grass a lot. I rarely try to kill in showdown i just try to get 2nd. You could memorize the damage of whatever level mortis you have so you know if you can 3 shot someone.

Brawl Stars should add a feature to be able to request and donate power points when in a club. This way it‚Äôs a little bit easier to get the power points for the specific brawler you need.

Yep its very nice
