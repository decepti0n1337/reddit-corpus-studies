Ok sorry won‚Äôt do it again

This map is so cool. Brawl stars has some pirate brawlers (Darryl and penny) but no pirate maps. I hope there will be some kind of pirate update where Darryl gets his voice and they add new pirate blocks kind of like the new city blocks in heist and dry season. I hope this map will be added to the game too

Did somebody say Snake Prairie except undiluted?

Yeah. I was like the second or third comment. Saw it on new. My bad

I hate teaming but if it‚Äôs against me a Leon...all morals are thrown outside my window. It‚Äôs either that or I throw my phone
---
I like the idea, but sometimes being afk isn't their fault. Trolling and stuff yes I see that, playing poorly... Well depends trophy count tbh
---
He really fun to play in showdown but hard to get higher that 5th or 4th
---
crap that was it, I was waiting for something to happen

---
#destruction 100
---
Oh Pam! lol funny you should mention that... check my newest post :p
---
If it‚Äôs against a Leon, I will team no matter wut
---
To what?
---
There will be a hidden score for each player, thumbs up gives them +1, thumbs down gives them -1. 
---
Players with high scores will be on teams with similar score players and low scores play with low scores.
---
If someone has an exceptionally negative score they should be looking for a ban.
---
To promote positivity and have people use this system, if everyone on a team upvotes each other, everyone on that team will gain bonus exp for that match.

My first brawler that was rarer than super rare was Spike. I waited literally the entire month of March before getting a brawler and it was Cactus Man yay
---
You're basically getting 17 gold per gem. A power point is worth 2 gold.
---
I like that analogy
---
Lol
---
Not at all
---
That doesn't give you fucking trophies. The first match after the tutorial and the bot match is the first trophy match. However, it is possible that the guy has played before, but just hasn't won any games yet.
---
It's been years since the dynamike/Mortis war, when a Barley threw his final card - a super super... Only one has emerged from big box 101 reuniting with an old face in carlsworth and has since adapted to life out in the random queues.. a barren wasteland where no trophy survives.. But from seeing super franks to the ghoulish Mortises and various raiders who've fallen to their spinning addiction two things are certain.. her tools ain't for fools and **showdown... showdown never changes.
---
Hopefully if this happens we see more Star Wars themed skins for colt and such
---
excuse me, but are you going to finish that box?
---
Well, it's possible that he has played before. but just not won any matches yet.

Well, it's all about theory. Lots of us lose our mind when hearing that Gene's super can travel through wall and now he's still not broken. I don't think this should change too much, just put even more skill required

STOOOOLEEEEEN

That looks like if Nita and Leon had a daughter, the hoodie and sweater from Leon and the bear and or resemblance to Nita.

Perfectly balanced as all things should be

Nope. It was a draw. Still better than -5 trophies.

Nice job OG proud of you (even if you did remove me as a friend but I understand whyüòÇ) keep going strong man
---
that carl thought he was the hulk when he lured into that frank and gene but got straight up bodied
---
Hmm that's true. But some how it works better with Primo... because you can just change directions to dodge his while the bear does his work. Always works for me.
---
I have to disagree with the lower Bull label. Because Primo can punch through boxes, I always found more success with him in that spot rather than Bull
---
 why did you do this when it cost $0.00 to not do it?
---
Suck a dick
---
Lol it‚Äôs just a joke chill out
---
put a /s next time

gg
---
That is where you are wrong
---
My heart has officially uwu‚Äôed
---
Darryl?
---
I mean, sure I understand they're probably better at higher trophies, but I have my Primo in around 350 trophies and I lost to a Darryl only once. I don'f see how he geys dumpstered as long as he isn't right on top of Darryl.
---
United States, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Europe, and Italy too
---
14 hours yeah right. Your phones lying cause you should‚Äôve been at like 20 hours at least jajaja. 
---
I resent the implication that I'm a noob and i'm not saying it's not possible to push him. In fact he's very fun to play, he's just underwhelming (mostly because in between attacks he is completely defenseless). I also love that he's so high skill cap, it makes the game more interesting. 
---
I wasn't trying to write an inclusive list of all the bad star powers in the game, those were just the first ones that came to mind. Here are some explanations tho..
---
Tar's star power lets her use it to tank a bit amount of damage to escape better, and I think it's more useful than it seems (although I don't have it) because brawlers whose shots don't pierce can't damage Tara when she's right next to them after supering them, which allows her to take less damage when supering. This means you can get closer to the black hole if you want, which is a tiny playstyle change. (I admit her star power is kinda bad too tho).
---
Bull's star power gives you another choice to play him differently, it's just that intentionally keeping low health to use it is a bad idea, so it's kinda useless. It's definitely impactful when diving in siege or in the last second of showdown or heist tho.
---
Overall I think the star power suggested in this post is probably too strong, even if it is high skill cap. I made another post about suggested star power reworks on r/BrawlStarsCompetitive tho, the top choice was "super leaves a trail of sharp rocks which deal damage" but I liked "super duration increases when running along a wall".

Wait that's illegal
---
Shout out to OP, I might just steal this photo for personal reference
---
Why did you post this again?
---
Was thinking the same. Knowing where to hit obstacles is a huge factor in knowing how to Carl. 
---
Plus his distance allows him to aim his axe and then arc his return, effectively creating a triangle- or cone-shaped attack. He cant shoot over walls, but this is a close second. 
---
Thanks
---
Oh yah that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm talking about you saw my post and then took a screenshot and the scribbled over the words and how do I know look at the top it‚Äôs the exact same as mine and NOW THE POSTS WILL COMENCE

Praise be, to OG

This needs more upvotes, what an amazing idea man!
---
Dang! Nice use of brawler mechanics! Especially on those behind the wall shots!
---
Spike and Leon 
---
no
---
Well I hope you get the other super rares and at least one epic pretty soon... Good luck!

There should be a kind of reporting system for those players since I also have faced teaming players in showdown. And it‚Äôs my personal favorite to be honest

Imagine feeling entitled to an exclusive reward for choosing to play a game

I ayed the game since day 1 but lwft for more than a year because they removed tap to shoot it was the best tume only ob's remember

Lmao fr this guy thinks that just because he's good at the game and has time to spend doesn't mean that a underwhelming character that the game (the players that literly support the game in its entirety) can't be changed around a little. We're not asking for a lot just yah know mabye a little better character.

Oh, right, LUL

I remember watching you on Kairos's channel in the draft wars where you got all your shots on with piper

Realistically, every location ever is "You'll die here"

Geeez ok feedback taken

Could be his star power instead

You have avenged all of us oppressed brethren.

Don‚Äôt play with randoms then buddy, not that hard. And what kind of person runs Carl in heist, don‚Äôt do that. Ever.

2 of my accounts around 2k have leon and spike. The one with leon has mortis tara and frank as well. All f2p

Back in the day I was barely getting all my brawlers to rank 15 and I got my Frank all the way to rank 17 as level 4. He was that strong

Hello

Thanks so much! :) any tips on how i can improve my photoshop drawings like a format or anything?

Leon! Hes invisible

I'm at around 4,3k now and have no mythics or legendarys. Spending around 20$ tho. I hate my life.

I love how it changes colors as you finish typing it so you know it worked andd you have to confirm it by typing it again, but people still fuck it up

You're a nice person. Congratulations, Master. 
---
Piper is SO underrated in showdown. She is great in showdown. She can just snipe at a safe distance. Her worst map is cavern churn
---
Yeah thats a great idea! For every kill you do you get +1 trophies at the end. That could stop hiding, teaming and would appreciate the people who get the most kills but die as 2nd, 3rd.
---
Where is spike?
---
Weird flex but ok.

Why are we even arguing ;)

He's having two mythics and 1 legendary now.

I can feel you.

Are you happy now?

So true

A lot of the pams were lvl 10 as well, and if I was eliminating someone that didn‚Äôt team I wouldn‚Äôt be spinning

Hello, /u/Ryan_Supercell !

Just want to know, what do you think about the game called "Tanks A Lot"?

Is the game an inspiration to Brawl Stars or just another shameless rip-off of it?

Let me know!

Yea but calculating has a whole would solve the problem of how rare legendaries are, I have a friend who doesn‚Äôt have all the brawlers and that makes it impossible to get high in trophies

I was playing a game as tara earlier with 4 remaining. The Gene and I noticed two Frank's teaming so we both teamed as well and took on the Frank's. This left the two of us where we were both too scared to attack each other so we died to the smoke.

Teaming cuck go play duos
---
I dont think win rate will be good too. Cuz not that good players can have a good win rate playing with a team and better players can have a bad win rate beacuse they play just with randoms.... people that play less the game can have a better win rate than people that play a lot even when this players that play a lot are better... I think the only thinh that this matchmaking is missing is power level of the brawler. Sometimes with a brawler at 350 trophies level 6 you are paired with a full enemy team with  level 10  and the same amount of trophies. You have to play against brawlers with star powers and none of your teamates have it.

You should practice more on it tbh for me it‚Äôs the easiest mode to consistently climb trophies if the hen grab map is unfavourable

Darryl, darryl... bawbabaobabw, leave

Dude, you have different labels and I haven't seen your post. Everything in your post is different, except the idea of labeled maps

El velocidad is a noun, so, it should be, "el primo veloz" üëÄ

This wouldn‚Äôt work because people would just camp where you land after using the jump pad, nobody would want to use the jump pads

What labels are the same?Everyone knows about throwers and death on the right boxes. And then everything is different.

And what I posted after you doesn't tells that I copied you

time to get exploited

plus: the trophy rued rewards are not that good i mean 2500 trophy for 50 coin is absolutely trash 
---
You are the definition of a random. Starpower on a brawler and still stuck below 500, blaming teammates..

i prefer the time when don exist auto fire

The camp in the middle, the death at the 3 boxes, I said that your "worst place to spawn" was "you'll die here" which is essentially the same, and the single "mortis" tag was just put in a new spot

oh soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

cute!!!!!

Not to mention the "free boxes but primo" reflects the fact that I put a camping brawler, Frank, there as well, but admittedly thats a bit of a stretch

Hello Supercell, it is not a question, I do not know what happens with the odds of the legendary ones in the brawl boxes that do not go up to 0.01000% and I do not have any legend and I have been playing this game since 2017.!!!
---
I would love to see a brawler with some sort of summoning ability.

No, SuperCell should not nerf her. THEY SOULD DELETE HER! üòàüòàüòà

&gt;If you see that Shelly dealt a lot of damage (killed poco, for example) or has red circle orbiting her:
---
&gt;DO NOT TRY APPROACHING HER - HER SUPER IS READY!
---
Every brawler should know this.
---
No you
---
But bringing a brawler into a gamemode where said brawler isnt good is a great way to lose. 
---
Ahh...a man of culture as well ;)

Sorry but that map isn‚Äôt so good.

i did not see that coming lol

You need to pick brawlers that you want to level first. Either because they are best to upgrade first or because you like to play them.  Then level them one at a time.  You won't have enough coin to do them all at once in f2p.  I myself have 8 brawlers that are awaiting upgrades not because of points but because of coins.  Fortunately as you run out of points for brawlers you start getting more coins. So you will eventually get them all upgraded.
---
Well the point is that teaming is actually a good strategy, and even if you don't like it you have to do it sometimes, if you don't wanna lose. Let's say it's a huge risk not teaming in certain scenarios.
---
Sometimes I temporarily team: I don't spin, I just don't shoot you if my reading of the situation doesn't require me to do it (starting a fight when you see someone is not always the right thing to do); then if you start spinning I don't spin back, just to clarify that we're not a team for the rest of the game or that I will help you, this is a "strategic truce" and I'm not fighting you just because I won't benefit from it atm.
---
Or if I'm 1v2 and someone helps me, then I can team up depending on the situation.
---
Most modes... Except for brawl ball, I personally like playing him in bounty, heist and showdown
---
Its so weird, I'm 3300 trophies and i STILL haven't got piper but a few days ago I got Carl... How did I get Carl BEFORE Piper??? I've been in that sweet spot where I have a chance to get piper but still haven't
---
wow thanks for the upvotes do you want more memes
---
am soo glade that i got mortis!!!
---
its my favorit brawler
---
WHAT DID YOU SAY???
---
What colored name means? Reputation?
---
Bascially NEVER approach shelly. If you have more range, kiting and spacing is how you will beat her. If you have shorter range kil bull or darryl... Then god help you
---
currently at 7450 and no luck from mega boxes they suck

Tmr is exactly 1 month since the monthly brawl talküëÄ

That Mortis though.

I do speak Spanish. It does makes sense and sounds cool to me. 
---
This map would be amazing for Darell
---
Ohh I remember seeing that one as well. Thanks for explaining!

also just me

I can agree with that but he is not the worst brawler also poco in siege for an example is useless  
---
ie

Every brawler has his weaknesses..... Poco's attack is useful for damaging multiple targets which powers up hi super faster... Which inturn helps him survive longer...... He is good in seige too...

this part of my life this little part is called happiness

I got Carl as a normal box, I'm kinda feel uncomfortable playing with him, he is okay i guess, but there are many others really good brawlers that can counter him,  
---
I've been struggling a lot against piper, colt, even jessy and penny,  
---
his speed is too slow compared with other brawlers and his dps is just below average.  
---
it is not as a good as i was expecting him to be.  
---
Im just a little over 2k trophies  so may my opinion is not as good for that reason
---
This is wrong in so many levels.
---
I have a hard time believing this. Nadie le va a decir "La velocidad" cuando puede ser "El Veloz", "El Rel√°mpago", "El Rayo" como alguien m√°s menciono antes. La velocidad no tiene sentido en este contexto. La velocidad de que exactamente o de quien? La velocidad no es representativa como nombre del personaje.

It's one of my favorites

Sigue haciendo sentido que se llame La Velocidad. Arc√°ngel se llama La Maravilla y nadie dice que est√° charro. Es cierto que pueden haber nombres mejores, pero hace sentido y ese fue el nombre que el OP le quiso poner. Y si representa pq est√° haciendo alusi√≥n a Flash, conocido por su velocidad. No?

Yes he will. All brawlers do...lower rarity ones just decrease the percentage less

I remember buying bull with tokens because I thought that I couldn‚Äôt unlock anymore characters if I didn‚Äôt have all the uncommons but that ended up being dumb

But then I was like you know 1 more game went hurt and you can tell where it went from there
---
–ó–î–†–ê–°–¢–ò –ë–ì

The legendaries were 500 tokens back then and you would get like 1 token from a box for every duplicate brawler. Times were tuff

I've been playing since global release and I got crow 4 days ago lel

Same üòÇ

I was a way lower total trophy count when I did like 2 to 3k

Yeah ik I got pretty lucky though back in the day. I have a screenshot on my phone of unlocking spike with a vertical screen lmao

At least someone thinks so. My art just keeps getting downvotes. I made a carl skin that took a really long time to make and I put a lot of effort into it but it still didn't make it onto hot. This skin has only 2 upvotes yet there are skins that are worse than this on hot with hundreds of upvotes. I really thank you for liking and appreciating my artwork  :)
---
Carl IS the teamer
---
Removed - Your post is too short, please expand on your title.

She needs a rework tbh. Nerf her super, buff her mid range damage or something.

No probs! I posted one today that took a long time too that got about 150, some just seem to get thousands

Day 86 still haven‚Äôt gotten a new brawler since Bo..  send help

I don‚Äôt have spike and my legendary chances is .27 or something
---
I only have 3k coins and that's not even enough to upgrade all the brawlers that I can level up.
---
He (or it?) is the only brawler I am missing... can you tell me if you are finding him (or it?) easy to use?
---
congrats, play for us betas players that do not have legendary

Yep, kinda janky but it's the best Spike I've got for now.

what do you mean a ban? and why do you think i‚Äôm ruining his account?
---
Con l abilit√† stellare
---
Here‚Äôs a few ideas for you.  Use them at will- I‚Äôll happily take some credit though ;).   
---
    
---
Prince- medium speed, high medium health brawler.  
---
Attack- lunges froward slightly with his Lance, dealing high damage (1600?), but only has one ammo slot to recharge after an attack. 
---
     
---
Super- charges forward increasing speed for short time, his damage is doubled, and when connected with an enemy he stops, allowing him one heavy strike, but also gets him into a god position quickly.    
---
      
---
Star power- after a hit he gains a small amount of extra speed to catch up to a fleeing enemy.     
---
Baby dragon- normal speed, hovers above the floor but can‚Äôt pass over walls, medium health brawler    
---
Attack- shoots an area damage fireball from its mouth dealing good damage (1000?), but damages on contact. Passes over walls but is instant area damage. Projectile radius similar to dynamites super, but a bit smaller. Average Reload speed like Tara‚Äôs. 
---
 
---
Super- He becomes enraged, allowing him to fly/ jump over walls by running (technically fly) directly into it. Allowing him to escape quickly but still be targetable. His reload speed also increases, causing a quick threat in game. Lasts x amount of time (idk) 
---
Star power- When he is alone in a radius (similar to bo‚Äôs old star power radius) his movement speed increases due to him being scared on his own. (Like In Clash of Clans) . 
---
We can go farther back
---
Me too but today
---
In the beginning of the month there was a leak for an update on the 28 which is in 2 days. So maybe then. Maybe
---
Leon fits it better

Every time I see an El Primo in Bounty, I know that team lost.

That's cute :p

I recently got frank so im part of the club now!
---
God Damn That Is A Tough Choice Oh Jeez 
---
Yeah like getting 221 trophies. It‚Äôs a term
---
Honestly. Carl is tons of fun to play. Like everyone else on this thread I think his star power needs a bit more but he's still fun. Maybe something where the pickaxe curves a bit more on the way back. I like the idea of throwing it and then running past a wall so it comes back and hits someone on the other side if I move enough.
---
You forgot to put "No Legendary" under the big box 
---
Yh I saw Theme Park Carl was it? It was really good. Can you look at my Ram Rider Carl and tell how to improve pls.

 But didn't you earn trophies

Her super is good, but if a shelly and a bull encounter each other in a bush, bull can two tap shelly and bull fires faster. The only reason the bull lost was because the bull got outranged. In Brawl Stars, range is a very important thing. If you have low range and no way of getting close to your target, you're probably a weak brawler. Shelly outranges a few brawler, so she can kill a few brawler in the game, and hardcounter at that.
---
This is the worst! 
---
Guess what
---
It was on purpose. I copied what everyone was commenting in the tinder post and pasted it in the first post I could find.
---
What's with your legendaries' drop chance?
---
Think its pretty good, Huh?
---
I know that high DPS brawlers are better for angry robo. But I thought somebody would play a thrower, but going to my battle log afterwards there was everyone else was Bull or Shelly. 
---
Shelly's super is good, but shelly is very bad. Yeah, shelly's super is good but it can only be used to counter close ranged brawlers. That's around 7/24, so shelly's super is very situational.
---
I remember those days
---
I just tell myself he bought him.
---
Are you dumb, Mortis; just dash away, you idiot.
---
Hmm, the matchup is very situational then, I think they both have an equal chance of winning.
---
I‚Äôll message you how.

Darryl is actually surprisingly good at killing shelly, his star power is so overpowered that you're dead if a darryl rolls at you. I've killed so many shelly's even through the super.
---
#HEAVY BULL
---
He gets ignored because Pam is OP. A nerf to Pam is a buff to Poco. Pam isn't a real healer anyway.
---
Me, she is a very weak brawler because of her low range.
---
He didn't made it
---
Its exactly like that lol =)
---
You read my mind:)
---
or did he idk
---
Oof I was way off
---
Completely wrong, shelly can only counter four brawler in the game, that's around 18% of the brawlers. \*Teamers\* ruin showdown.

Not many brawlers can beat a 20 power bull. She‚Äôll can 
---
I love brawlcraft keep it up mordeus!
---
(Nobody)
---
but u can fix it
---
Oh and btw can you add real time battles with other players
---
Me in siege 
---
For me it changes at 14:00  so you're 1 hr ahead
---
Thanks 
---
But darryl definitely makes up for the range with his passively charging super.
---
No sorry
---
That‚Äôs what she said!
---
Would be cool, but I don‚Äôt think Supercell would be willing to buy the rights to Harley Quinn to make it happen
---
Be in brawl ball..... God I hate that game mode!
---
The original was posted a long time ago and it got like 2k upvotes, you're just doing this to get karma
---
\*when auto fire didn't exist (really? There wasn't auto fire? Didn't know that).
---
Go to the subreddit, as in click on the logo to go to the reddit brawl stars homescreen. The click the three dots in the top left, and click ‚Äúchange user flair‚Äù. Then select who you want and click apply

HAZAH! WISH YOU THE BEST OF LUCK GEDI!

No, IRL money for tournaments
---
There is no such thing as a skilled primo
---
Good map... But similar to cavern churn in middle
---
Actually, you're right. 
---
I was at 4.7K when I got Spike it hurt really bad
---
I disagree. Removing auto-aim isn‚Äôt gonna make the game better. You can say that it‚Äôs taking skill from the gameplay and to a degree you‚Äôre not wrong, but that‚Äôs mostly the case for long range brawlers. For close-range it‚Äôs an essential tool for many people (myself included) because auto aiming is reaction based, and unlike long rangers, close rangers need to be face-to-face in order to be the most damagingly efficient. So having to quickly attack that one Leon right in front of you is what makes auto-aim and important gameplay feature to a lot of players. 
---
Simply removing auto-aim will be an indirect nerf for close-rangers, as aiming your shots takes a noticeably longer time than quick firing, and -like I mentioned- it‚Äôs gonna be a lot harder to quickly take down an enemy in your face without going all panicky. I understand why you want it removed. It‚Äôs not fun to have an auto-aiming colt in your team, but in my opinion I don‚Äôt think many close-range players will be happy if Supercell just removes auto-aim.
---
But hey, maybe Supercell will add a ‚Äúdisable auto aim‚Äù option in future. Would be a best of both worlds.
---
Carl is a good boy and Jessie is a good girl so they are perfect friends 
---
It was ironic, you know?
---
Ahm... Have you noticed that if you get x/y = z, and then you do z ¬∑ y  =x you're just moving numbers, and ofc the number will be the same, right? The difference that you see it's the last decimals of the rest on 240/4.9

Yet. ^^^^^^owo

I refuse.

"Srpelo sounds"

I mean they‚Äôre both good. I wouldn‚Äôt really say one is better than the other.
---
CHAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGE
---
I think it should give you or one trophy or a tiny reward such as some gold or tickets
---
What's this? An insta comment on Reddit? 
---
You forgot April 1st update /s
---
Unfortunately
---
Yep. Unfortunately. People in showdown will spin to show that they want to team, it‚Äôs kind of annoying but I don‚Äôt play showdown all that much
---
Can you supercell give me mortis please? Y just want him
---
Why is no one mentioning the TNT
---
friend, is question, in case there is an administrator who can see this post
---
Yeah, but you could use the one tile gaps to cause the robot to stop and ‚Äúattack‚Äù you even though it can‚Äôt cuz there is a wall
---
Too many walls, in my opinion. I think people would only play barley and dynamike on this map, but if you remove some walls I think it could be a very nice map :D
---
I see your point. But, when autoaim got added, close range was buffed as hell. Then it got nerfed in the damage of the op brawlers. I also hope they rework leon. Thing is the game worked perfectly without autoaim
---
The pinching would be so bad
---
But I don‚Äôt do that shit
---
What? 
---
The angry robo? 
---
if your talking about angry robo then nope. stormy had energy drink and healing mushrooms. Angry robo does appear a lot on dune drift tho.
---
Not all mikes team, believe it or not 
---
You got to believe -Kevin Malone
---
it‚Äôs and [idea], it don‚Äôt happen...
---
Well, yah, but most do. Its just a joke :/
---
U clearly worked hard on this u rly deserve to get some love 
---
ughh ice seen this 100 time. lemme explain. hes og and played along time ago and at that time there was no trophy road and dynamike was a common brawler and didnt need 2000 trophies to get.
---
#DOWNVOTE HIM!!!
---
I‚Äôm surprised they didn‚Äôt just dive
---

Gem grab
---
I am at 42k coins AHAHAH. 
---
I didn't collect any of those rewards hoping Supercell change it
---
Nah, i like the cowboy theme
---
Thank you
---
Okay guys lets do some dancing! 
---
Yeah it‚Äôs not that common in lower trophies but I‚Äôm at 360 with Leon and I just had 4 dynamikes team up and at that point it‚Äôs impossible to win without teaming yourself
---
You do realise that I'm complaining about my luck right? I got Leon almost 2 months ago and crow 5 months ago. Before I got Leon(6.4k), my last brawler was piper(3.8k)
---
I hope S.C. takes it... 
---
Please buff crow I love it but it doesn't feel like a legendary
---
Yes, although I'll admit I don't know what the radius is. Clearly I'm lower level and don't have star powers unlocked lol
---
The dev team said a long time ago when the game was in beta that they will never give rewards other than XP for Star Player because it would make people focus on getting SP rather than focusing on the main objective (playing as a team).
---
Repoooossssttt
---
Brock is a trophy road brawler you only have to reach 1000 trophies to get him
---
Sad no one mains dynamike I‚Äôm deleting this so uncultured people don‚Äôt take my internet points üòë
---
You can‚Äôt do one block gaps some brawlers can‚Äôt get through 
---
Hey everyone, let's play a round of "spot the bad player". 
---
De momento las repeticiones se quedan guardadas en los servidores de SuperCell. Si hubiese tant√≠simas replays, tendr√≠an que invertir mucho m√°s en servidores. Limitarlo a 400 ayuda a que no los tengamos que guardar nosotros en el m√≥vil, y antes tampoco hace demasiada falta.
---
If u see my most recent post you will see what my barley did ;-;
---
Please do Mega Knight üòç
---

---
#unless you play bull
---
It's because in Brawl Stars you need more inputs since the game need to record every fraction of seconds of your movements and there are 10 brawlers in the match (Showdown), so the servers needs to be better to record every input. But i think they will low down the min amount of trophies to watch the replays. 
---
You r not explaining it to me still 
---
he is, do you not know what win trading is?
---
Why the barley? He won
---
Circle the whole map and put SHELLY AND BULL ONLY
---
iM aN oG bEtA pLaYeR
---
If only his super lets him jump twice, even if it forgoes some dmg
---
The two non skins
---
His poison needs to do more damage after it hits
---
I'm not a true anti-teamer. I've accepted that there will be people who team no matter what unless we actually have a solution. I have one, which is making brawlers drop the number of powercubes they have.
