&gt; island invasion haas more bush
---

---
I am telling you that you cnanot escape huge amounts of bush in the middle, which you can easily do in island invasion.
---
&gt;So you want every showdown map to be same?
---
I want them more skill based than luck.
---
&gt;There's still strategy to when to open boxes
---
Ok? It is a lot lesser than what you can strategically do on other maps. In this map, you get blasted. In other maps, you can at least escape bush and focus on somewhere else of the map.
---
&gt;You can control your area and scout the bushws
---
And blasted to death in seconds because you cannot shoot to that blind spot?
---
&gt;Your last part can be for any map
---
It's just A LOT more common occurence in this map
---
Look, all we saying is, this map is a little more luck based than other maps, that's what we don't like about it.
---
---
---
CoC had the Healer Angel. CR had devs who listened to the community (lol nope). BS has Gene. 
---
We all need (emotional) support sometimes.
---
I guess that could work 
---
I've been drinking the wrong brand my entire life
---
That's a better but worst way to put it
---
Typical idiot that think it‚Äôs just: ‚Äúget better‚Äù. Ok dude, whatever you say üëåüèª
---
So... you should be happy
---
I wish it was like Clash Royale where it‚Äôs red or blue to show if it‚Äôs a friend or a random person.
---
Agree
---
F for u
---
There really isn‚Äôt a counter. Don‚Äôt take them all on by yourself. Wait it out and try to team with the other people. Pick them off one by one. If nothing works, accept your fate, camp, and get the highest place you can.
---
My only problem is how many Bulls appear whenever it‚Äôs in rotation and the obscene amounts of grass at mid.
---
Yea but my 
---
Legendary drop chances are low as heck
---
EUGENIO CRAB

Robo Bros
---
i dont think stun effects should be a thing, let alone this common on a brawler
---
*bushes start speaking bo and bull*
---
Literally no risk
---
I dont know what you were looking for but that‚Äôs it...
---
You have seen players get high trophies with power 1 right?
---
Same. All of my friends who play brawl stars are at 2000 trophies or below. Since they can't keep up with the skill level i just end up losing a bunch of trophies. So I just end up playing a lot of solo showdown.
---
I thought you were always maxed in friendlies?
---
Cool nota bro &lt;3
---
I noticed you‚Äôre low in trophies. Just keep playing and learning the strengths of each brawler and how to play them on the maps catered for them, that way you aren‚Äôt making ridiculous claims like ‚Äúit‚Äôs all luck.‚Äù
---
you can take a picture of your statues then just take a picture of the materials you use. Either I am being dense or you are doing this on purpose. 
---
Hey you can kill two birds with one stone

Dynamike has to learn that teaming isn‚Äôt good. His theoretical ‚Äúfriends‚Äù can betray him, even his bird!
---
i got him to 500 in solo showdown, just gotta be somewhat aggressive
---
LONG RANGED BTAWLERS!!!
---
Weird flex having Tara but ok. 
---
Nah, the brock one is the best
---
You're enjoying the new model over the old?
---
Hey thanks!
---
Ahhh yeah
---
Got Crow in that lunar offer. 
---
Yea, after the bock skin
---
It would be more like 100 coins for 50 gems, or even 100 for 25
---
Yeah, very nice argument. I think this discussion is now over.
---
But liek, why did they change Barleys icon tho?
---
Literally unplayable without it 
---
If you‚Äôre admitting you‚Äôre wrong then I guess it is üôÇ
---
I really hope that gets added like take my wallet supercell me want peon skin
---
yea
---
Well, just farm up some boxes.
---
CAN HE SLAM IT*building rises then crumbles*
---
 
---
yes. yes he can.
---
Leon typo
---
MIRACLES HAPPEN....
---
Ah it's Bull with 10 Power ups....
---
I‚Äôm max sooo
---
Wow he‚Äôs so dumb 
---
He's top nita and penny bro
---
Well Gene comes out soon, so you'll have something to use the points on
---
*STROKE TIME BABY!*
---
True that
---
Same for heist
---
I like the map, but it seems like its mostly just negatively affecting the high ranks, how about You guys under 3,000?
---
nope...
---
dude, 9.4k here(10236 pb) without legendaries. supercell needs to increase leggy drop rates for high level players
---
"Don't touch my canary"
---
it was removed for some reason. I liked shooting star
---
I have 2.8k trophies, no I'm not high rank but just because it negatively affects you doesn't mean we shouldn't have a voice.
---
 Thats why we're a community, to hear diverse opinions c:
---
My Excellence Is Undeniable!
---
Ha lol try being 9.3k missing two legendary 
---
I think that they will change Shelly a bit, just like they did with Poco and Colt.
---
Damn that shelly is hot...
---
It just gets harder
---
You all don't realize that 10 times MORE means 1+10
---
Great! Maybe only 3 capture points with 5 brawlers, so it isn't one on one the whole time.
---
The brawler u r currently using must be above 400 trophies 
---
You don‚Äôt have to look at them if you buy them all! üòÇ
---
No, it isn't. My crow is rank 20 and it was easy to push trophies with him. 
---
On a brawler, not total trophies. They‚Äôre just testing it out so they want a smaller player base to see if they work fine
---
Technically is if the first box you open is a big box or mega box, but certainly not probable 
---
Yeah, fair enough. I've never played Mortis, so I can't speak about that, and although that it is true that those champs you mentioned don't take much skill, I think in this situation it's more about decision making. I do think that if I played Mortis I would agree with you though. Anyways, thanks for staying cool and not getting all defensive and what not.
---
Ur so funny 
---
i have your brawlers(and bo) at 9400 trophies. push some cups!
---
In my experience, what usually happens is people rush towards and fight over center, then the team that holds center successfully usually wins. So I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôd be left to 1v1s, but I‚Äôll take note of your suggestion!
---

pretty good actually
---
Nice Man! Still waiting for Leon and Spike, now when gene comes out knowing my luck I‚Äôll probably get him and legendary drop rates will go back down to 0 :/
---
Ik know ppl who got 1K tho

This was amazing

Why it‚Äôs that ?

That‚Äôs fair enough lol, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs still relatively new tbh

because some skins look cooler on the preview screen then in game.

Yet it feels good on showdown lol. I always find dumb Leons rushing me thinking they are invincible
---
Why do all noobs think bull in the bush is op. It's not, and it doesn't exist. If you don't know how to aim your shot at a bush, just quit showdown. Bush camping Bulls don't exist because of the actual problem in showdown that noobs just brush off. You can't bush camp when everyone is spinning and no one is killing each other. So can you noobs stop being so unoriginal and post at least mid-effort memes.
---
Lol. Come on they can't every guys name in the game. They took inspiration. They didn't rip off his whole design.
---
Should have left the bull to attack all the bo‚Äôs lol
---
Of course not, this is a very serious issue. The geniuses over at Supercell allow teaming because of the amount of strategy it takes to recruit an army of retarded people as fast as possible, to then bully one person off the map at a time. Solo showdown is a true team-based strategy gamemode that requires the strongest of minds to play properly. 
---
also yeah im fucking around
---
Focus on getting all your brawlers to 500 before worrying about what happens next. Maybe you‚Äôre feeling Darryl, and you get him to 600. The next season hits and you drop by 50, but you have another two weeks to make that up + progress further.
---
No. 
---
Hell yes. After 4 or 5 games
---
Go Poco! Love the drawing :)
---
Every modern router has 5G channel. Wtf are u talking about
---
It seems like his nerf wasn‚Äôt horrible, but practically every brawler received a buff, which indirectly is a nerf to other brawlers.
---
Stupid idiot, do I need it spelled out for you, WHY Bull in the bush. Piper has a star power revolving around bushes, make memes about her will you.
---
I think it is pointless to lose and gain over and over. But thank you for advice
---
Or just a Karma whore who wants new people to upvote him

Heh, sorry, my bad. Just sorta annoyed how teaming is just the only thing in showdown and it needs a stop.
---
When they added a bunch of community maps to the game an update or two ago they gave credit to everyone who‚Äôs map made it into the game so I don‚Äôt see what the difference is in this situation. It might just be coincidental that they both had the same idea and that the devs didn‚Äôt notice there was a post about it however. 
---
LMAO
---
I do, but tilting makes you play other modes sometimes. It seems like SSD is "Bulls here! Bulls there! Bulls are everywhere!" lol. Or dynamikes thinking that they're human helicopters or some shit. Shellys that have a broken phone screen from tapping so much, the list of SSD stereotypes goes on.
---
Sorry to say it but it doesn't get better with lvl10 mortis, shotgunners are OP and are killing the hopes of a diverse meta.
---
That's my face playing Gem Grab. Other than that I have fun with the other modes.
---
Non Competitive mode would just disable trophy reward. There would be very little to actually change in the game. All game modes would still be played. It would just be two separate queues. One for competitive play and one for non competitive. 
---
You weren't lucky, just good
---
Clash royale has been out for almost 3 years and it still doesnt have a working cancel button lmao 
---
More like any solo showdown meta?
---
Rico is broken 
---
I have a friend who Shelly supered so hard he cracked the shit out of his screen.
---
They just underestimate him
---
They said they‚Äôre fixing it :P
---
*fair start*
---
You have a pure soul my friend.
---
What happened to shelly's gun
---
He may be a tad overpowered so I am adjusting some stats. His health is being bumbed to 5000, his punches will do 400 and the kicks 700. His super‚Äôs main hit after his enemy is lassoed in will do 1800 and when the enemy lands he will take an additional 200 along with anyone in a 4 tile radius who get stunned for that 1 second.
---
Comment if you think he still may be overpowered.
---
Ye
---
Forgot to mention - this is a map for the game mode Big Game
---
Damn. I had a friend who bush camped with Bull so much that he got all the Boy Scouts badges.
---
For real? 
---
A single Panzer division destroying an entire French army (circa 1939, colorised)
---
The meme is referring to life and not brawl stars. Just edit the meme to say brawl stars. 
---
I had a friend that dyna-spinned so hard he grinded his thumb tissue down to the bone.
---
Atleast it‚Äôs not shelly or bull lmao
---
This is literally the same as me. Maybe it take more boxes now...
---
I bet Supercell won't reply back
---
mortis
---
I had a friend who stole so many kills and power cubes as Mortis that he's serving a life sentence for robbery.
---
yea showdown is so overplayed
---
I see what your saying now. That could work but you might as well play the friendly match. I personally wouldn't want to play a non competitive mode because if I get nothing, then its a waste of time to me. That also would change people's mentality when playing because they aren't really worried about losing anything, then they play differently. It's kinda like playing poker without money, you won't take it as serously making you a worse player in a sense.
---
He's giving that face that Rico players give when people say rico is a weaker Colt.  
---
Great art btw!

They added one....and he sounds AWESOOOOOOOOME!

Uhhh
---
I highly suggest you wait until you get his star power. With the Brawl Ball Nerf, Play him as an aggro assassin. Every time you kill someone you practically get full health. You can 3 shot most characters, and most of of the others with Super. In the beginning of the match, just run around trying to kill an enemy of your choice ( Use your judgement, Try Killing Throwers, Jessie, Pennie, Crow,). Once you get your Super, just roam around and wait for the perfect opportunity to kill at least 2 of them. Try to not pick up gems unless it‚Äôs 100 percent needed.

Them motherfuckers .
---
A. Showdown supposed to be 1v1s, so it's expected for you to pick brawler that could survive and do well by themselves, such as shotgunners at maps with alot of bushes and walls or long range at maps with a lot of empty areas. Bull has this attributes, in form of high health and damage
---
B. In other map like gem grab you need aggro brawler, one that could deal high damage, prevent carrier to grab gems, prevent enemy aggro to disrupt your team hence Bull is a decent choice. Although in some cases Bull is not the best pick for all maps
---
While in heist, his super can reach the safe also destroying walls. But back at it again, in some maps he's not the best pick
---
C. Overused? It's 22 brawler pool, people will find the meta and pick one that will make them win and apparently Bull is pretty easy to be used for new players. A lot of counters for Bull are available also it's not like he's Leon broken
---
Ahhh, Jessie's old portrait, Dynamike's and Rico's Old model, and derpy mouth Mortis.
---
Great
---
And Come back Life leech
---
I find it pretty good too!
---
Because a brawler on the team has 400 trophies, at least that's what I've heard will happen
---
Very cool 
---
Wow that was savage 
---
I legit laughed at this for long
---
Hah primo scared of super
---
I would wait until the last day to buy the pack
---
I.m asking this myself.I just got Crow in the lunar offer but I was hoping for Leon/Spike.. Do they regularly appear in the offers or Leon was there for some fast bucks? 
---
yea, and it's crashing very often
---
Good
---
I'd go for the crow buff train in most cases, but this one... Crow's super its one of the highest burst damage in the game, if they were to place  something like that then you could expect the same nerf than Barley.
---
If crow needs something is damage but not in that shape. Its hard to get Crow's super and with this probably they'll make it harder to load.
---
One man army.
---
Well I'm here to shit in your shoes a bit. Most people won't make it that high and this sub will stay being inundated with mid tier stuff as the average of the player base will be that, average.
---
Better sorry than my freaking Ex ..
---
It‚Äôs there so every brawler has two skins in the background, ur getting downvoted becuz it‚Äôs really obvious
---
Nice one
---
i guess its my first time
---
Ohhhhhhhh....We need a shirtless bear (the animal) with a 24 pack who throws axes that explode into fire bombs and all he does is laugh or scream (in Russian) depending on if he's killing or killed...
---
Thanks
---

---
Thank you!!
---
Lmfaooo bruh don't do em like that
---
Ehh!! Rlly?
---
Very detailed arms and shovel though 
---
No, brawlers only have 2 skins in the background if no skins have been made for them. If you look at Jessie, there are only 2 skins. If you look at Shelly, only 2. But Brock has 3 skins AND he has a silhouette as if more skins are coming.
---
You really don't have to aim for first place. Just don't rush mid, collect boxes in corners and maybe pick off a few, and I'm fine if I end up 3rd or 4th. I also like to play this map as Nita, and as long as there isn't a plethora of star power Bo's, I find myself getting positive trophies fairly consistently. The map is very luck based, but up to a point there is still strategy you can take instead of rushing mid. Plus, personally, I find the tension makes this map more fun for me, even if I lose
---
None... not saving boxes hoping for one brawler. Opening more boxes now so my drop rate chance is still going up. Makes no difference if I save them or use them now
---
How does he spring forward and do a back flip?
---
Do one where the snake is all grass and call it, "Snek in the grass." eh? EH?
---
This isn't a traditional wedding dress skin because there are so much concepts of that. So, I made it a pastel blue instead.
---
This is epic, can we have this as the official merch
---
Why ban it? It is not agains any rule.
---
Survival means using anything, even strategic alliances, to survive.
---
Banning teaming is like saying "invisible leon should be banned" or "camping in a bush should be banned". They shouldn't.
---
Thx
---
5 weeks? Thats a joke right? I‚Äôve been around since beta and only have 7k lol..
---
Of course, but like you said, that's the reason why we hate this map, because it's very luck based. Not that you shouldn't play it. You should be able to win it most of the time if you're good enough, which is the case in literally all of the other maps (i don't like island invasion too but you can easily go to middle in there, so no complaints on there)
---
r/thiccochet
---
RIP CROW
---
Yes! Mainly because in island invasion there is open space in the middle that allows for different brawlers, not just solely bulls and max bos. I play colt there mainly. In cavern churn, however, it‚Äôs really just hordes of dynamites and bos and bulls in the late game. Idk it‚Äôs just more fun.

This. What they should be asking for is a different game mode based on total kills or some other solo factor. Personally I'd love to see a 3 or 5 min free for all map where respawns are possible. I think it would be a great addition and give us solo people something extra to do that isn't just solo SD. But as it stands, solo SD is a survival game. If people have worked out secret handshakes to figure out how to better play then it's really up to you to either get on board or be prepared to adjust your play style.

Yeah I literally thought of that right after I posted it. Maybe it only shows band members names that are spectating you only? And it‚Äôd would show the first 3 people to spectate your match
---
Is their a specific one that is good?
---
üòÇ
---
Nope I just need Crow but I dont have the offer
---
–í–∞—â–µ
---
yes and why after they nerf lol
---
Came here to check that also
---
I have crow 
---
Thought it was real for once
---
No cause you will get trophies then doing 3v3 you are a totally noob without strategy and skill rip 
---
Ok? 
---
Yup
---
Wow wish i had so much luck

It‚Äôs good but depend on how many brawlers you have 
---
The big brawler has to survive past 2 minutes and 15 seconds to win. 
---
Wait what?
---
I was talking about myself, not you lmao
---
That's a lit wallpaper!!
---
I already have Leon and Crow so my offer is Spike for 549 gems
---
:)
---
Oooohhh ok lol
---
–ñ–∏–∑–∞

Prove it

Thank you for the suggestions. Am in process of saving boxes for Gene so may well wait to see if Crow comes when I open them all. 
---
Hehe, Thank you

Hola

I've seen this type of problem often. Your Graphics Chip has worked its way up from the logicboard in one corner. This   usually can come from mainboard flexing or excessive heat. Off to the repair shop...it will only get worse until you see no picture at all.
---
Well that's for sure not long range. But is still long enough. There are only 3 ones that are longer. Piper,Jessie,Colt and I'm missing one.
---
If that Colt hadn't used his ultimate uselessly to the Jessie they could have won.
---
maybe u were lucky but ppl with skills can do that
---
Yes it is
---
F or  p  Ai n  a  nD fo R  gL Or  y

did you buy the offer..?
---
Ya :( so sad

Thanks for the response, guys. Seems like I'm not playing brawl stars for a while now :P

Thanks for the response guys. Seems like I'm not playing brawl stars for a while now :P

It was still stuck at the end I just took the picture earlier
---
His super is a pet Scooby Doo
---
To fend for my life whilst having my health quickly drained by a high-skilled Piper?
---
When i say "everyone loves showdown" i don't mean "100% of the Brawl Stars players love it" even though it sounds like it.
---
I already knew that, but thanks for the advice anyway...
---
Colt looking slav
---
Mortis kept stealing their gems
---
who gives a crap about being OG only fortnite players cry about that
---
Precisely.
---
I still don‚Äôt get the purpose of this post.
---
That's RNG in a nutshell. Everyone has a fair chance, others are just luckier.
---
Bruh they made a mistake Brawl Stars team made a statement saying that they will patch it in an optional update... It‚Äôs not a bug... 
---
Same lol
---
Supercell plz nerf Primo 
---
This poco will follow me into my nightmares
---
Bro i got two mini accounts and one main....NO LEGENDARIES
---
Leon? Balanced? 
---
(He is worse after The Nerf but still beeter than Crow)
---
Thanks for sharing! 
---
It‚Äôs cool and alll but HELL NAH I ain‚Äôt wearing no gamer Jordans
---
Yes you can get brawlers from Regular boxes too! I got Frank, Piper, Pam, Spike, Tara and Moetis from them.
---
Um... It's not *back*, it has always been like that
---
None.
---
Fu*k supercell THEY ARE DUMB GET RID OF THE TEAMING OR ADD REPORT BUTTON its not fair i cant push after i reach like 17 rank 
---
Resolve micro lag in game
---
if you already have leon then you get offer of other leggies. otherwise just leon. it's upto their mood what brawler they send as offer.
---
 you get star power from boxes but brawler must be level 9.  having enough powerpoints for lvl 9 but not being upgraded doesn't count. 
---
That happened to me on my mini and i don't have any maxed there 
---
it's a 300 gem skin so yeah .
---
I've played for 7 months too, and just hit 8k with 17/22. Then I got Leon right after.
---
I hope you'll get one soon!
---
Sorry it's at 70 upvotes I must downvoye
---
Common meaning the trophy road brawlers or th rare brawlers? 
---
Lung cancer strikes again...
---
The bug is on ios right? Well android is better glad i have android xD

Give us better chance to get legendary without pay money plzZzüíôüòçüòò

---
I mean considering that you only have 444 coins, I'm pretty sure you need those coins as well. Boycott all you want. They will only change if they can make a profit by making it cheaper. It is a business model after all
---
Oh really? I dont even get the box in the shop the free reward that i got on all my 3 account were 14 gold...
---
BULLLLLL DOZZZZ........
---
*Voice in the distance* YOU LOOOOSSEEEE
---
Lvl 100 crook at play here
---
Yeah I experience this too. When it‚Äôs a match where I‚Äôm like 1/10 but then I hit cancel and it still queues me up for the match. I think in this case it‚Äôs more of supercell‚Äôs job to make sure the queue removes us from the match rather than keeping us there. However, I do think again it‚Äôs more than that. What if there were already ten people queued, but it was actually just checking the connection of all players to the match. 
---
Either way, I agree with OP‚Äôs post but I still think there‚Äôs too much we don‚Äôt understand about how matchmaking algorithms work to make it sound like an ‚Äúeasy fix.‚Äù
---
okay thank you! appreciated
---
I found leon
---
Russian community grey againüåö
---
wait for super to charge up . roll in , kill,roll out. and yes he sucks against tanks+ leon. he becomes way better when you get star power ( he is in top 8 at the moment). his best modes are brawl ball and bounty . also works in showdown depending on what you face.
---
learn to use the water pond on maps, this ability makes him great at escaping tough situation and allows longer travelling.
---
ahaha i just went 30 post and spam NERF LEONüòÇüòÇ and yeah i now he got nerfed bit just a litel bit more dmage ner or range, hp nerf one of those bicaus he is still op
---
Sick

After a tedious concert. Looks so cuteüòç‚ù§Ô∏è

my bad üòÇüòÇüòÇ i forgot they thiccned Rico,  sighhh now my hatless floaty boi Darryl will get mixed up with NotRicochette

549 ... but Where i buy for 700 gems? Mmmmhhh ü§î Superceel trolling?
---
Nice
---
Typical Team Mate when i okay alone... 
---
your phone is beyond science LOL
---
*Logic had left The server*
---
If he‚Äôs a mythic 16.68%
---
No, he' s right
---
The increases chance only applies to Legendary Brawlers. I recon Gene is supposed to be mythic right? 
---
same happens to me
---
Hahahaahahahahahahhaha thah made me laught so Hardddd BULLSHIT
---
Bull has joined the chat
---
Are they from Darryl?
---
Stop teaming
---
Why does Jessie's face scream "You wot mate?!" in my head?
---
#I DONT WANT A CANCLE
---
Omg
---
Oh god the throwers will rule
---
If the attack hits nothing it does something like penny' s (whes SHE hits)
---
Have more trophies than you with only 16 brawlers, so having 7000 trophies isnt high trophies
---
Teaming is a strategy, SuperCell approve it.
---
However they don't encourage teaming between players that know each others, that's why you have no names displayed past 300 tr.
---
Only kids are complaining about "unfair" teaming.
---
(YEAH BOIIIII) 
---
Maybe you will be poco
---
I love him... and don't have him...
---
Jesse and nita‚Äôs spawnables are really strong and leon (if you have him) is really strong
---
very cool! lovin it!

You forgot the /s

Dude cancel button works sometimes

When u get the reference

But is not cringe
---
Is cute

But it came out today
---
Supercell ID?
---
You should of waited for new brawler lol
---
That's great bro! Ur so lucky I've unlocked a super rare as my highest.
---
At 1:30 , today is so long my friend
---
At least then you would know where he is by the growing bushes
---
I  know, I always try to team with peeps who will kill the damn Leon or crow in the game and when I do, they‚Äôre like fuk u I want power cubes and kill me bc they r try hard 
---
I have a good connection almost every match i have no clue what causes this, it wasnt like this before the new update 
---
Yeah i dont have 1 super rare and 2 epics
---
Ïò§Ïò§„Öó ÌïúÍµ≠Ïù∏Ïù¥Îãπ

Oh, sweet, it‚Äôs fixed for me too
---
I have a friend who works in supercell. She just gave me the server to play gene.
---
same way. 
---
3300, the game should be playable without friends, i mean im not the faker of BS but at least i dont make any of those things i said above
---
he has crow what the frick
---
boohoohoo üò¢ what a crybaby
---
damn nice. gratz!
---
What the hell!üò±
---
Only English, reported
---
I‚Äôm at 2100 trophies and I don‚Äôt have bo, mythics, and legendaries 
---
Thanks! I‚Äôll pass it to you now :)
---
Why did you give shelly an ushanka?
---
Dont like the idea of mirror
---
E should have like a shelly/nita type range damage like 400-600 with quick reload and like 3-3.5k heath
---
Luc must be distinguished from colt who already shoots 2 lanes of bullets, slowing them down would be better as a starpower only if both shots hit
---
Tim sounds ok i dont like throwers
---
Randa is way to inconsistent which i dont like the fact that you could hit someone for 1 damge just upsets me
---
Rip mortis. Was my favourite back then (still is) but they ruined him
---
You are not alone.
---
yeah my dog works there too
---
I was very often the big brawler and idk why I wanted to be a normal again after a time haha 
---
I found another noob user here!
---
What program? Also amazing artwork! :D
---
I‚Äôm thinking to buy Leon too.. is he actually fun to play? Don‚Äôt wanna spend the money and hate playing him and not have any fun
---
I dont get this issu( i have an android) it could be something with phone
---
I am really hoping this is a joke... or just shitpost
---
That's not thic tho xd
---
She's incredibly fragile, is slow and her attacks take ages to reload.
---
  
---
If you can't handle a Piper, it's not because she's easy to play. Play her and you'll see it's one of the hardest brawler to play. She's good in bounty and some showdown map but that's it
---
Yesterday they announced an optional update coming fixing this... Stop making these posts
---
so true
---
This...THIS IS ART!
---
OP is the original creator check his/her profile he/she also has Twitter :v
---
That really good bro you must have a lot of trophies
---
When you select any other brawler it goes to the last skin you used. When you click on dynamike it goes to the spot the Christmas version of dynamike occupied 
---
Yea sorry it was kinda a bad choice of words. People who love showdown tend to be low to mid range trophies, not because they aren‚Äôt skilled, but because they think ‚Äúin showdown I don‚Äôt have to worry about stupid teammates‚Äù  which is correct. And that is one of the contributors to why some people like showdown. If you find good teammates and don‚Äôt play with randoms, you solve this problem. As a just over 10k player, I have pushed 17/20 of my brawlers to 500 in showdown, but I would‚Äôve much rather had done that in a high pace game mode such as brawl ball.
---
Ps. Just to remind you there is nothing cowardly about retreating, and YOU should do it if you the gems. (You also shouldn‚Äôt feel bad about retreating because that is literally 1 of the main aspects of gem grab
---
It's called pentakill xd
---
Basic attack is a smoke around him? How does he do damage? Is he like crow and he poisons then with smoke or what? Also add a drawing
---
Thanks for giving your opinions! I'll try to learn from them. Those Brawlers were my first ones, so I guess it's normal that they aren't that good for now.
---

That's awesome. Can you also show us the painted version?

He means the spinning thing inside the nose ring

I know... üòÇ
---
IMO it is overpriced
---
I feel you üò≠
---
I love new ideas i just try to think how would it be balanced and based off how other games have failed their not bad ideas just not realistic
---
Shelly is OP in this mode
---
Same here I have 2 legendaries and all the rest of the brawlers so lol
---
This isn‚Äôt even that bad lmao
---
Didn't live up to his name
---
*Allow to purchase only for accounts created before global
---
Old Brock and Dyna should be added back as skins. While the current default Brock(and his skins) look really good, (Dynamike is meh, gotten used to him but vastly prefer his old model), I would love to see 'classic skins' for the brawlers that look totally different after their rework. 
---
Jesus Christ Shelly, Poco and Nita look fucking terrifying. I was just about to go to sleep, thanks        :(
---
And how you're named there? 
---
Holy crap you really deserve gold.
---
I feel so bad for them. I'm losing brain cells while watching this.
---
Welcome to hell 
---
For the ticketed events you need either 400 or 600 to unlock and for the special events you need 800
---
I think you don't understand how to play Piper. Yes she has the most damage and the biggest ammo range (without counting Spike) and yes her attack is the fastest but here is the thing.She is slow AF, she doesn't hae a lot of HP, she has the slowest reload speed of the game and she get destroyed by absolutely every brawler at close range .If you think she is OP, you just yave to aproach her, she is slow so she can't run away, she doesn't deal most damage at close range so you could beat her and she couldn't spam you because she has slowest reload speed.
---
Could work as some reward to Beta players if people really wanted it like that, I guess.
---
 My group defeated a frank in 1min and got 25tokens , should i post it ???Cause it looks like free karma
---
it was discounted and at 30 gems before the update lmao
---
I have 4K cups and don‚Äôt have Darryl 
---
I agree with Colt and Shelly but the other old models look okay 
---
I was talking more about people maining a brawler but yes i know.
---
Thanks :)
---
Isn‚Äôt that how it works already? I mean, I‚Äôve never seen a bull outside of a bush so I just figured. 
---
r/whoosh
---
Yay! Happy to see max brawlers in friendly games!
---
But only when they are live
---
Exactly how is supercell gonna fix the fact that you play with randoms and have bad teammates
---
Omg I would love to play old Mike, Brock and Mortis again! SUPERCELL PLEASE!
---
well i haven't seen much yet, but how is 6 people not attacking each other not bad?
---
I had a friend who pulled Crow as his third brawler. Also, a friend with less than 3k trophies got Mortis and Tara on the same day.
---
Mine‚Äôs Still crashing 
---
Well i guess it‚Äôs a little bad, but on this map especially, you usually see teams of 8+ every game 
---
There is basically no need for this, it really doesn't matter who is watching you. This feature would only clutter the screen, the game is supposed to be simple and clean with only 3 joysticks during gameplay.
---
Exactly, in situations like those, I'm not even sad I lost trphies. STOPTHESPIN
---
People who team in duos don‚Äôt deserve human rights
---
Then he is basicaly a tank leon
---
Thx! 
---
And he has crow too
---
You‚Äôre spending less than I would be. I‚Äôm going for the full 50 because I only have 30 gems 
---
What are you doing?

Teamers are all jerks.
---
Lol I just noticed xD
---
No,its from battle block theater))
---
Why does this game like to match up teams of three against solo players?
---
Or these guys are just bots 
---
Yuuup
---
Glad to hear
---
Yes, kill those teamers, show them the meaning of SOLO showdown; the mode that needs skill.
---
We are supposed to do everything we can to survive, this is the only rule. So teaming and also backstabbing are fair strats
---
Lol I have 7.5K and played since the very start... just never gemmed I guess ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 
---
you got that from Nubbz3‚Äôs discord...
---
Yeah but I also cannot deny so far they actually give pretty good amount of tickets
---
I mean I end up with around 35-50 per week. And thats like at least a 800 tokens. So basically a extra 8 chests per week isn't bad
---
Nah i would want 1 coin = NO MORE BULLS IN BUSHES 
---
This should be a settings menu configuration if anything. 
---
Ahh I see, Thanks for responding!
---
Credit to the op please
---
Thanks!
---
Yeah
---
We need to buff his star power to make it 3 or 4 tiles. But not 6
---
I opened two boxes and didn't get any brawler, can you believe that??? /s
---
Lol it was me üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Gotta be at least 400 trophies for that brawler
---
Im not talking about legendaryes i m talking about atleast epic or mythic or legendary i have everything else unlocked
---
Congrats, don't forget to use his hat
---
Do the smug dance Jessie!!
---
Elusive 
---
I have no epics mythics or legendaryes 
---
*When the bush starts speaking Bull*
---
Take a thrower to kill throwers 
---
The biggest pain in the ass is eating oranges. If the juice gets on your display,you'll have a hard time playing if you don't clean it fast.
---
This is a strategy - if you are being cornered and there is a good you are going to die, you teammate should draw attention while the other gets away
---
Just reached 4k, got every brawler except the mythics and legendaries. Probably opened up about 10 mega boxes
---
We fought for the hat. It will never be ignored
---
Gottem. New Scooby-Doo episode where they take off his hat and find that it is the droideka that was stealing all the power cubes.
---
We need a capture the flag gamemode 5v5 on a showdown map or something 
---
That‚Äôs good!
---
Why people is upvoting this? Lmao
---
He is a martial arts scarecrow sensei. Hiii-yah!
---
I am level 160, reached 11k, still no leon
---
Yes, that‚Äôs how it should be!
---
0.16
---
I am F2P too, i know this pain.
---
Does it close the game or is it in game connection? If so it's probably crowded servers
---
u/frank_supercell fix this please
---
Is it worth buying him after the nerfs?
---
Same
---
I want a ladder wich every brawler has power 10
---
And that's why you don't go everyone on the middle
---
How much is that? $20 is 360 gems. Even on sale, paying 549 is crazy!
---
Ma che cazz...

Yo this is dope

Holy smokes that was insane.

i would prefer spike but my special offer is for leon. is leon still worth getting ahead of random schedule? I have no Legendaries yet.
---
Your post has been removed, make sure to use the body of a post to elaborate on the title.
---
(He got buffed mate, he deals more damage now, so unless if it‚Äôs not a whoooosh, delet dis please thanksüåö)
---
Level 105 and 0 of these, I cri everytim
---
I think that his main attack might be instantly killing anyone coming near his path, even though that will require him to use 0,03% of his total power. So i guess he‚Äôs a bit underpowered.
---
Upvote this comment if you think Teamers are the worst!
---
It‚Äôs not really your fault, making passing the ball require ammunition is kind of dumb
---
7494 trophies as of now

same

I guess the wall only visually disappeared, and it takes a little longer for the actual coded wall to dissapear.
---
Don't worry dude supercell doesn't care about OG players they want us to spend money and they're trying hard üòÇ
---
The other Colt had 128 Trophies, literally unplayable.
---
This is how the system is kinda meant to work, let the bad players who just push on one brawler get owned
---
El primo is here
---
30 gems goon! Saw the price @80 in the dev build and said I should buy it now before the update lol

---
He‚Äôs still good, he‚Äôs just not as dependable as he used to be.
---
Now you have Gene to worry about 
---
Yeah getting 50 coins in the later stages is the most lackluster thing ever
---
Really seems like a bot. Were you around 50 trophies?
---
I probably got something like that, I got a crash either after 3 or 4 matches, especially SD

Yep

7k and I am missing 2/3 leggies, played since day one IOS
---
Chip sticks are been better if you can use them 
---
Mortis' old pose was the best victory pose imo. The losing pose also made him actually look like what he was based around (morticians).
---
God's work? Looks like scavenging to me
---
I'm in
---
ok thanks
---
Weird, I got Leon and then Crow came. I personally like playing support and his poison comes in clutch pretty often.
---
Best thing to do is keep your distance, shelly does take skill to get close to the opponent
---
yes, and the game still crashing.
---
Said no gamer ever anno 2019.
---
I mean, who hasn't heard of micro-transactions at this point. Everybody knows any form of box/chest contains items.

Hell yes

I hope you‚Äôre joking

He‚Äôs already been nerfed. Still good though, it being worth it no one can decide but you.

If it doesn't work the first 3 times, lets keep doing it cause why not?

Thats how BS works or is it only from this map?
---
I hate you
---
üóø
---
It is
---
TARA OP infinite super
---
thanks
---
Even with his star power bull isn't very good in this gamemode I think...
---
I want to die
---
Don't buy boxes. You can buy a 1000 Token Doubler for 50 gems or buy tickets and consistently get high time on Robo Rumble.
---
Wait hold up isn't showdown and brawl ball only supposed to be in the 4th slot?
---
It isn't backstab because it's solo. 
---
Now listen here you little shit
---
I used to play 2 to 3 hours per day until i got all my brawlers 300-340, after that teaming gets so bad the more trophies u gain that i know barely get the daily tokens.
---
Just got my first legendary today!!
---
I'd use all those tickets and pray for RNGesus
---
**D o m i n a t i o n m o d e**
---
**e n g a g e d**
---
Come on people!  It's obvious that this dude bought the legendary brawlers with gems!  Don't be so damn gullible!!!!!
---
With all the 3D printing going on it really makes me appreciate when someone is truly handcrafts something.
---
*tokens
---
Bs works like dis,theese are all spawnpoints,so it is going to be 8 at the centre,somwhere,it will be no boxes in some plces,maximum 24.
---
Would be fun but that defeats the purpose of ticketed events 
---
Dioporco
---
Oh hey nice username
---
lmao
---
I‚Äôd give you gold if I had some. üëçüèº
---
You paid gems for ricochet? 
---
It‚Äôs been made
---
He‚Äôs been nerfed by supercell he isnt great now
---
Or Dynamikes.
---
Explains the max rank bull
---
Seems ok to me :3
---
His DPS,speed and Invisibility
---
Nice :)
---
You got him to 360 at level 3, post nerf. That‚Äôs great. At some point, DPS brawlers are gonna start to overpower/outplay you. It isn‚Äôt because he needs a buff, it‚Äôs because showdown isn‚Äôt his best game mode.
---
Try him out in Gem Grab, Bounty, and Heist.
---
In Gem Grab, he does well to take out Gem carriers and pinch opponents into your teammates.
---
In Bounty, he can consistently take out players with high bounty, and get away with his high movement speed.
---
In Heist, he can completely flank an opponent, and either deal massive damage to the safe, or help your teammates to break through for a more invested push.
---
I feel like it would be 30 to fit other rare brawler skins 
---
He's shit anyway
---
I'm at 2.6k, haven't spent a dime, been playing a couple games a day for just over two months and I've unlocked everyone but the Legendaries (and Bo). 
---
I didn't think it was difficult to get anyone other than the big Three. Piper was my last to unlock.
---
Repost ughh ugghh
---
And I have 8.500 trophies without any legendary.. 
---
Dude I‚Äôve subbed, all your work is amazing, thank you so much üôè
---
If you posted it, it means you think it‚Äôs impressive.
---
but do you have the money box just in case?
---
I can see that.
---
Same with Leon please 
---
I‚Äôm guessing you haven‚Äôt seen the range on his super. Don‚Äôt talk shit when you have no idea what you‚Äôre talking about.
---
Why are skins so expensive now?
---
Has Leon not got toes ?!?
---
121
---
He doesn't. Its very sad
---
Definitely 
---
Please upvote posts like these. SUPERCELL needs to see these immediately
---
Actually, there are to main types of using it - defensive and offensive one
---
While using it in defense is pretty simple - just spawn it via auto-aiming your super - star power makes it a lot more effective, cause before defeated your bear can heal you up, so that can save your life:)
---
Still, using it in offense is quite more challenging, because there are more ways of it and more mistakes can be done (the firs one - not use on shotgunners for obvious reasonsüòÑ)
---
So, while he can be used in offense to help you to chase someone by blocking his pass white a bear, you also can become viable by getting close to someone and spawning a bear among you and your enemy. Aside from it will give you a shield if your enemy does not have a piercing attack and it will increase your firepower - with a star power it will create some sort of healing circle - you will heal you bear from your attacks, hiding behind him, and he will heal up you, attacking enemy in front of him. Of course, it will not last for a long time, but still make tougher a lot.
---
Hope it was helpful‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
The second slot is for Showdown. The fourth slot is for Brawl Ball and modded Showdown
---
Violated
---
I‚Äôm at 5k and have everyone besides Piper and the Legendaries 
---
Theres no way you got that high without any epics mythics ir legendaries
---
Removed. Rule 3. No providing information on how to break Supercell Terms of Service.
---
F for this guy
---
Play them all equally, don't main.
---
I have participated on the ticket events but still nothing, the worst part is how my friends just always say shit like just be patient XDDD.
---
You‚Äôre an idiot. 
---
What‚Äôs your problem? Did you seriously get offended for a comment?
---
YEAH GOOD MATCHMAKING FOR ONCE
---
I did this with Leon
---
U mean THICCOCHET
---
It‚Äôs even worse after 10k, believe me.
---
Wow... Cool! 
---
Now this is good stuff
---
This reminds me of the movie scenes where the hero is outnumbered but then the bad guys betray each other and the hero just swoops in and cleans up. Basically what happened lol.
---
Bro, u pushed him to 360 in 2 days with power 2, i have shelly on 350 in 2 months with power 8
---
Yayyyy!! My favorite!
---
That‚Äôs precisely what he said. 
---
So you got killed by two Leons? 
---
Nice work. Thiccochet next?
---
üõë STOP! YOU HAVE VIOLATED THE LAW! GO TO COURT OR SERVE YOUR SENTENCE!
---
The which?
---
How do you know if either side was actually a team or not? You're just assuming based on skill?
---
No,he's good where he is BUT THOSE FUCKING TEAMERS ABOVE 400 ALWAYS KILL U FIRST CUZ UR A LEON AAAAAH
---
ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
It will be broken though
---
Wait nvm you can just buy skins
---
Maybe for Clash Royale, but it seems to work fine for in brawl stars. 
---
yes his ability of being useless is really strong now. 
---
Then they would go from OP to useless lol.
---
Tax
---
Top for dynamike.
---
I think she haves so many farts! üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Yeah I would want that back
---
That's really cute
---
Wish i had that change of luck.
---
Gave up and started a new account due to not unlocking any new brawlers.
---
Gave up at 5k with 13 brawlers.
---
Hadnt unlocked a brawler from a box since 1600.
---
Still didnt have any epics mythics or legendaries....still didnt have all super rares either
---
This map is the best map I've ever seen! u/brawlstars
---
Good idea
---
Hahaha
---
Brawl ball?
---
That is awesome.
---
thats pretty much what gene already looks like
---
Pure damn lies
---
That tara just lost her last brain cell
---
bEt
---
I‚Äôm at 9.5 k I went since beta without a legendary and last week I got leon and spike within two days.
---
I dont want to shatter any Rose Spike-tinted goggles but...
---
A lot of those models look super ugly, especially Shelly.  Dynamike and Brock could be made as skins, as one redditor said.
---
Just search on YouTube or something and you willüëå
---
Hahahaha
---
What, when, why, where?
---
Unfortunately, as we all know, Brawl Stars has no way of communicating through a global chat (as in Clash of Clans), finding club members, or finding sociable comrades for the next team fight. From our own experience, we know how difficult it is to get your club members excited about Discord. The agreement in fights then usually falls by the wayside. Experience shows that only up to 25% of "casual" club members use Discord. We want to ensure that all users, no matter whether they are good or bad (relatively speaking), Android or IOS, young or old, diurnal or night owl, ... can exchange ideas and socialize on a common platform. Since we know that there are already several hundred discord servers for individual clubs, we provide here a fair platform club-independent for all devices. The focus is clearly on the cozy togetherness.
---
What we have planned ...
---
¬ªRegular voluntary training sessions with tips and tricks from experienced players
---
¬ªDiscord internal tournaments depending on the desired game modes (Brawl Ball, Showdown, etc.)
---
¬ªCreating a cuddly cozy Brawl Stars community
---
¬ªClassification of players for learning, not for skill (we know that everyone started small)
---
You are convinced and would like to support us?
---
Then rip off your ingame friends list and bring along all your Brawl Stars friends, because only together we will grow up! Just send them the link to the Discord server the next time you play together, and we'll grow faster, as you can imagine. But remember: growth is not everything - it should also be comfortable;)
---
Invitation link for you and friends:
---
Invite to the Discord server and join yourself: [https://discord.gg/g9mXymF](https://discord.gg/g9mXymF)
---
Did you know... that we are looking for committed Discord Server administrators who will take care of the future development of the server and implement new ideas? I'd like to get in touch.

Relevant username.
---
Much like Pam, Barley and Poco? 
---
Okay. But a nerf is still necessary. They're insanely powerful in boss fight to the point where its unfair. 
---
Ricochetüò≠üò≠üò≠
---
Words from the Bible 
---
Ok I bet my penis that it hasn‚Äôt been exactly a month boi
---
To be completely honest, I actually like the new brawl ball a lot
---
Wait...they had tnt!!??!
---
Poco looks like hes going to steal your fucking soul tbh.
---
Hmm, that's interesting. Now that you mention it, I may have noticed a slight decline in connection quality since the update came out.
---
Playing for a month and got nothinn
---
Maybe his reload speed or range should be buffed
---
thats exactly what i dont have either. in at 4.4k
---
Man i would love to see it that parrot could fly around his head XD
---
Is this the new meme template
---
Just missing crow 
---
Pam and Barley are great against the boss tho, while nita and jessie are trash against boss. I think it‚Äôs balanced, you never know what role you will get.
---
i am glad frank didn‚Äôt get first place
---
I straight up thought u were gonna run into the storm lmao
---
Genius
---
sin dolo no more gloria
---
I do play overwatch
---
Bro delete it
---
Loli 
---
Not just buy skins but we can buy in gems TOKEN DOUBLER or shop BOXES BIG or MIGA BOX.
---
Just missing spike, how long have you been playing 
---
banned?
---
This is what I like to call Squads with friendly fire
---
Skins and players are offered in PC games too. I remember the D3 days and the bloody auction shop. Real money for weapons and gear. There‚Äôs nothing wrong in charging to keep the servers running. The lights don‚Äôt pay for themselves. Ryan‚Äôs gotta est too! It‚Äôs F2P but for the rest of us who support the devs and the millions of updates they give us it‚Äôs justification. 
---
Damn 8k? And I thought no legendary at 6k was rough
---
when ur friend plays brawl stars for the first time: skull trooper?
---
Wow that is brilliant
---
But him
---
He is a skelleton. If he didn't die at a young age he is prob old. The joke still counts :D
---
Wtf
---
CREATURES OF THE NIGHT
---
is it true value ? 
---
I'm still laughing at this please help
---
Welp I give up then.
---
still worst lega, no matter how much love you tryna give himüòÇüòÇ
---
You‚Äôre below 2k and have a legendary
---
This is sad
---
I think these would be greatly voice lines for Darryl!
---
True
---
They should bring the goal a bit up, but make it 1 tile less so that ppl cant corner with the ball
---
You just want 'ol Morto back, dontcha?
---
Is the title seriously 1 sentence?
---
Lol looks amazing
---
I did that on my first day of playing 
---
Absolutely Genius OMG
---
I want to bring old Shelly back. She just looks hilarious.
---
Actually anyone can brake the wall because of the new update which states one block gaps don‚Äôt exist anymore so the game decides to brake the wall or the skulls to make it a bigger gap
---
is there any chance you can make crow? i feel like he could look really cool with his slim character model
---
Owu 
---
Ok
---
How do you think she flies into the air like that?
---
If you have that money to spare and are fine with losing it then go for it
---
ThiCCoCheT
---
That's soo cool
---
so is darrly 
---
Thanks for the chip. I‚Äôll remember that. 
---
Yeah I know just thought it‚Äôd be cool, I‚Äôve always been curious as to who‚Äôs watching my games, I‚Äôm sure many others have as well. The names would come up on the top part of the screen where the black box is
---
People who say auto aiming is op need to see this video lol
---
It looks like 10 or 12 bridges
---
Before the update I prepared a Google Doc I planned to post here where I wrote voice lines for all the brawlers who didn't have them (including Bo, Brock, and Mortis at that time). I figured I'd go through now and show the ones I did for Darryl, Tara, Spike, and Leon then. 
---
Working on moving Tara's to paper now. Figure people would rather look at an image than click a link or text post lol
---
yl*
---
And the few bullets that hit him is the nerfs he got
---
Then you can't get him faster, simple as that. All you can do is farm for boxes, but it's not like there's some way to speed things up.
---
Lol, Beautiful fanart!
---
That's why I'm trying to push trophies with him,
---
Jebaited
---
&gt; Barrel Boi 33
---
Mythic
---
i‚Äôd say maybe frank?
---
In the friendly games the weekly challenges won't award you points it's just for practice but not in the friendly games it will award you points so people are still gonna buy tickets to play it
---
May it be with you
---
Shelly would not be Ashe, their attacks are completely different. If anything Nita would be ashe, both shoot medium range, super spawns a big dude that does damage, it makes way more sense.
---
Because he won't be Super Brawler or for other reasons
---
there‚Äôs a section in the help and support in game where you can visit for some info on this!
---
not even 1000 tho, feelsbadman
---
Yeah mate you have half the trophies he has.
---
Ohhhhh
---
The mouth trumpet really is impressive. 
---
And i've oppened around 200 boxes and i still dont have my shelly star power, be patient.
---
The Og Days
---
Omg üòÇ
---
Top ten thing you can‚Äôt unsee once you see them
---
His stun is nerfed to the ground as the attacker, and he is easily overwhelmed as the boss -&gt; he is bad in big game. But actually all brawlers have the same chance to be the big brawler.
---
What are you making these out of? They are really good
---
r/bikinibottomtwitter 
---
My first brawler besides throphy road was actually mortis, but I suck at it, I'm only missing the legendaries now 
---
Lol me too
---
In any map
---
Shh
---
Couple days ago got Crow, Piper and Frank in the space of 24 hours with only free boxes, this shocks me.
---
Brock mortis dina and rico are probably the best ones from thos collection and deserve to get added back in the bgame
---
I got it sorted in the end.
---
I caved in and made a 2nd Supercell ID just for it haha.
---
Assuming chance from each draw is 0.1%, and each brawl box has 3 pulls, you'd be opening an average of around 350 before getting a 100% value. Even that doesn't guarantee it. Playing on a single account slowly but surely raises luck over time. I see why you want Leon, after all he is a fun brawler, and pretty good, but a lot of other brawlers are also fun like Rico, Dyna, and Darryl. Just because you can't get Leon doesn't mean you can't enjoy the game.
---
Muhahaha
---
SUCH A GOOD IDEA!!
---
Bull,primo and shelly are really easy to push in showdown in lower trophy ranges compared to other characters. But once you reach a certain point, it will be completly bull free, or at least there will be much less bulls.
---
Idea: make the goal more thicc and deeper so you spawn inside the goal but far away from the "goal line"
---
How many tokens did you get from this???
---
Annie...are you Ok? Are you Ok Annie?
---
Wow 
---
He is good in bounty gg and sd he is pretty good and with his sp buff i could say he is actually op 
---
That‚Äôs what I was thinking
---
Im not agree on all his point. But in this particular video, the arguments he uses about the transgenders (not abortion) are quite good. I like the way he's confronting the girl. I don't know the guy. This video is actually the only thing i have seen from him.
---
Bad at game 
---
Half the map is inaccessible without dyna‚Äôs star power or a super
---
On my mini, had 200
---
Stop stealing artwork that isn‚Äôt yours 
---
Don‚Äôt auto-aim 
---
How do they even ..? I‚Äôm not gonna ask lol
---
AYE DANIEL
---
What did I just see...?
---
Where the fuck are the mods
---
Every club has a Big Chungus
---
Even more epic than a draw in Bounty.
---
El primo and Colt having hardcore anal sex my man
---
Lol, i wanted to make some this kind of post, but didn't have a friend who has Tara :). Nice one, take my upvote! 
---
I'll just sit in my corner still wishing I'd get a new brawler.... atleast I got Thiccochet tho.. 
---
Made a report there are underage children on Reddit too ffs
---
You peaked my interest, now you have my attention.
---
yeah i get you, in higher tier games it makes sense that matches will go into overtime. interesting perspective to take into consideration...
---
How?
---
hahaha
---
great idea!! make the goal size deeper!!
---
Does anybody know if there‚Äôs a confirmed date yet?
---
wtf
---
r/lootstars
---
I went crow a month ago and I play daily (I have 3600 trophies) and I do not want to leave another brawler
---
I salute you
---
Stuff really gets me going I got my first legendary st 7750 trophies
---
10.4k beast
---
Firstly these lines are great they should be official 
---
Secondly i want to write like you -_-
---
I‚Äôll happily take it !
---
3
---
Yes we need more incentive to not bush camp 
---
I see You are new to Reddit. Reddit is not about stealing other people's post and saying that that's yours. If You like someones post You can share it, tag that user and write that You like it, etc, but You cannot post anything without giving a credit.
---
There is no rule against posting what you get in a brawl box 
---
mans wanted a spectator
---
This looks dope
---
I 100% agree. Rewards are the same, while higher players need more of everything to progress. A lot of high trophy people are lacking legendaries as well. Rather than a useless 150 pieces of gold, they should give an instant 0.1% legend chance/draw increase per 100 cups starting from 8k. If one doesn't need it, then just give gems. Higher players don't need gold or boxes. They need brawlers to keep pushing.
---
Im at 5k and I have  all the mythics,legendarys(except spike) rares and super rares(except thiccochet) but no epics for some reason
---
Does this happen for other people aswell?
---
yeah for max robo rumble time
---
Your wish is granted with an upvote!
---
How can you fuck a comment so bad?
---
Playing since global too. Only got 15 brawlers, missing all epics, mythics and legendaries excepting Pam üòë
---
Mental gymnastics
---
Luck of a pro
---
KiNd sTrAnGeR
---
Because there can no longer be one tile gaps
---
So it breaks the wall
---
Oh, that's just because I've only ever spent ten dollars, from a gift card I was given. So it does count as paying, since I got gems I used to not own, but I spent it on skins because I don't like skipping progression by paying, it's not fun.
---
Don't you mean, _pass_ the word. 
---
So true
---
Tara super chaining is OP
---
OMG I JUST FACED HAYAT TODAY
---
Ayy. 
---
Waste
---
You should become a professional photoshoper
---
Love the idea of little red hood, but tbh i don't like it aestethically
---
Don‚Äôt waste them on a skin.
---
I got 2k gems as a reward, I don‚Äôt spent money on brawlüòùüëå
---
Maybe they can make the goals bigger and still have brawlers spawn in the back of the goal. This‚Äôll make it so that it will take more time for them to reach the field.
---
I was thinkin that was being sarcastic, sorry
---
Only if you have maxed acc imo. I would rather spend my gems on token doubler and event tickets for more boxes then skins. Maybe just me. 
---
Especially in wall-filled maps, just try to avoid confrontation. With dynamike, if you can get close, then you can really mess him up, and barley has low dps, so just try to stay away. You can zone them as well, pushing them out of walled areas. When it's just you and them left, just stall until the poison closes in. If you have a super that can break walls, then you can surprise them, being able to break their cover.
---
Press F to pay respects... Or press G to not pay respects...
---
Love ya
---
I want the old spawns back but with a bloackade for the ball so that you cant corner it
---
I agree, ive been meaning to get skins like Dumpling Darryl but it seems impossible for a player like me because drop chances are unforgiving and they purposefully put them only for a limited time.
---
I also missed the christmass skins because of this.
---
Yea it's been happening a lot to me. I hadn't died from it until one showdown today. 10th place hurts. 
---
Spike took two days.
---
But from their perspective, aren't you a random?
---
yeah it depends on what enemies you get
---
You discussed it at Discord server
---
Mortis is the best, followed by crow &amp; Leon. Pennys turret and Nita‚Äôs bear are also good at them, and brock/ricochet/tanks can work as long as you build up your super really quickly
---
Wild. Would love to see how good his squad is. 
---
Stealing posts huh
---
Mortis wrecks throwers. He can dodge their shots super easy and does enough damage to 3 shot them as long as you aren't level 1 and they're maxed or they have a ton of gems in sd or something.
---
Not just older devices. The new update fucked something up. The game crashes now for people too. 
---
omg wow so cool :O
---
Disagree completely. I think it's more fun and competitive now. Way better than before and I hope they don't change it.
---
I didn't play often before, but now, it's amazing!
---
Only my opinion anyway
---
F to pay respects
---
Hide in a bush for all eternity.
---
This just shows how F2P brawl stars is. You dont have to be max to be number 1
---
Of course it is. I was just saying that it's your privilege to see it all the time, comparing to ones who didn't buy the skin and can't even see it as unavailable in the character section.
---
Not only your post. Look at his profile. Every single post he made is stolen. Go and downvote it now. u/FlavioInnocent
---
Of course 
---
Max Bo: **heavy breathing**
---
Honestly that looks pretty fun
---
Goddammit, that's too CUTE X3
---
Pay to progress? Not really win
---
oof my theory then
---
I have all brawlers at 4k trophies yesterday üòÇ I did buy Leon but all other from free brawl boxes üòÇ
---
Because the dbd subreddit is a meme factory.
---
Yeah that was me lol
---
I saw that too, posted it as well to spread the word. Let‚Äôs see what happens 
---
I got crow from a free chest, I have no epics and no mythical though
---
Is it a glitch or intentional?
---
Uh, no sadly but now i have the itch to go check them out.
---
They should let his poison stack. That honestly seems fair
---
