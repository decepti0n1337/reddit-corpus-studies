The dev team said a long time ago when the game was in beta that they will never give rewards other than XP for Star Player because it would make people focus on getting SP rather than focusing on the main objective (playing as a team).
---
Repoooossssttt

Brock is a trophy road brawler you only have to reach 1000 trophies to get him
---
Sad no one mains dynamike I‚Äôm deleting this so uncultured people don‚Äôt take my internet points üòë

You can‚Äôt do one block gaps some brawlers can‚Äôt get through

Hey everyone, let's play a round of "spot the bad player". 
---
De momento las repeticiones se quedan guardadas en los servidores de SuperCell. Si hubiese tant√≠simas replays, tendr√≠an que invertir mucho m√°s en servidores. Limitarlo a 400 ayuda a que no los tengamos que guardar nosotros en el m√≥vil, y antes tampoco hace demasiada falta.
---
If u see my most recent post you will see what my barley did ;-;
---
Please do Mega Knight üòç

#unless you play bull
---
It's because in Brawl Stars you need more inputs since the game need to record every fraction of seconds of your movements and there are 10 brawlers in the match (Showdown), so the servers needs to be better to record every input. But i think they will low down the min amount of trophies to watch the replays. 
---
You r not explaining it to me still 
---
he is, do you not know what win trading is?
---
Why the barley? He won
---
Circle the whole map and put SHELLY AND BULL ONLY
---
iM aN oG bEtA pLaYeR
---
If only his super lets him jump twice, even if it forgoes some dmg
---
The two non skins
---
His poison needs to do more damage after it hits
---
I'm not a true anti-teamer. I've accepted that there will be people who team no matter what unless we actually have a solution. I have one, which is making brawlers drop the number of powercubes they have.
---
You are right. Her super is to op
---
Im gonna be frank, that joke was horrible
---
Buff edgy birb
---
Buff the edgy birb
---
But it takes shelly quite a few supers to kill bull when bull literally needs to tap once. Bull can shoot faster than shelly so it doesn't take much to kill her.
---
Its good but Alls I see is throwers
---
52 card pick up with Tara 
---
They should know this, but the truth is, that then when there is an enemy fucking shelly, you're always wasting ammo checking the bushes so you're always at disadvantage because of the constant bush checking.
---
Carl can‚Äôt get 3 shots. That‚Äôs not how he works. He has one shot, a boomerang. That he can‚Äôt throw again until it‚Äôs back. 
---
To troll
---
Thanks man! If someday I have the knowledge on how to do one for sure!

Lol I can 1 up that I think. My Darryl dropped from 432 to 296

---
Lol I knew I‚Äôd see a crow buff in that list
---
She is too cute!!!
---
&gt; Low damage, even point blank
---
I wouldn't say that. She can 100% to zero most brawlers point blank except tanks, and even then, her super will be charged by her third shot and will finish you off.

Honestly any of these Leon concepts would be great or just any skin would be fine
---
... which is why they should make the super button an option (like the way it was before), as I posted 
---
List of vharging characters:
---
Bull
---
Shantae
---
Demoknight
---
Scalebearer
---
Good idea but it ruins the way people would play and just go for the kills instead of defending the safe or something like that 
---
Get a team
---
Is Leon viable in Siege? I tried using him once and tilted 80 trophies with him...not sure if I'm doing something wrong...
---
r/suddenlycommunist
---
Buff bot to 500000 healthed bossfight boi

Yeah that could be cool

Am I the only one who thinks a lot of these are too much Pam would be the worst brawler with these changes
---
/r engrish 
---
I subscribed to t-series.
---
What does it have to do with brawl stars.. 
---
Or just rotate it...
---
Just so you know, Supercell has banned players in CR for doing that. 
---
The funniest thing is that when I opened my boxes when Carl arrived in game I win Carl and Frank too ):v
---
I feel your pain. My friend once changed my name to MeGaay (in Clash Royale, fortunately)
---
That's nice, atleast you're supporting someone. 
---
I think I'll never get him because at 0,1776 I still got no legendary
---
Eh Leon ain‚Äôt so bad outside of showdown now. Spikes bad to go against anywhere
---
People have told me he is pretty good at gem grab
---
Nita, before attacking me, make sure you have a meaishield. Spawn a bear and walk behind it.
---
Owo

table of contents

---
fuck wrong subreddit
---
Looks like it can only show the graph once you put your profile tag which means i can't see  brawlers
---
Which tilted before 
---
Actually I find that statement correct. I, along with many other players, have no idea how to deal with Shelly. At a glance, she seems very powerful, easily able to eliminate you if you make a wrong move. She is not overpowered but I still think that her ult charge should need more than one hit to charge and super should not charge super.
---
I got crow at like 400 back during the beta lol
---
We are number one but it‚Äôs GEORGE WASHINGTON COMING HERE TO HAUNT YOU
---
Tap once, shoot, tap once. You should be able to tank a hit
---
I would give you gold if I have one üèÖ
---
I got Crow two days ago (the last Brawler I received) and got him to 500 in 48 hours and no trouble. 
---
He does not need a buff. 
---
Switch Pam and Shelly. Pam has no weakness, nor counters save maybe lobbers. She deals insane damage up close, and good damage afar, good range, and is a tank that can heal
---
My noob friend got Spike. His first reaction was: he sucks.  
---
The next day he got Leon (unbelievable). Apparently, Leon also sucks.  
---
Noobs are hard to satisfy.
---
Mythicc
---
Crow should be a D.O.T. brawler, I think it would make him very good at pestering the other team.
---
This looks sick!
---
Commit die
---
If you‚Äôre a high rank but low trophies, do you match make against tougher or easier opponents?
---
This? 
---
Sad but true mah frend
---
Global was much later after landscape. I really miss ‚Äòtap to move‚Äô controls, it was a really strong way to play once mastered
---
If she's beating you when you're crow or tara frequently, you're bad at the game.

Easy farming tho

looks good!

Yes yes

There are now too many Mortises which are hard counters to Dynamikes.

Yeah mortis is the new showdown meta

Crow is balanced

Change my mind

Do NOT try to drink and eat too much before going to a rollercoaster

Lose 30 trophies getting 3v3 star tokens
---
Gain them back grinding solo showdown
---
I don't see lot of morti either....
---
Wow I really like it nice job. If you have a model you can print them but don‚Äôt they print with colour why did you have to paint it? Also was the model free? 
---
I don't trust strangers with 10 of my trophies
---
Yes, like that, but for spike ! Mobile plz.
---
The thing is, you get more trophies by teaming and not backstabbing, sure if you backstab enough some people may stop teaming, but others won't and as long as two of them are in the same match they understand that they have two options:
---
1- team and win 5 to 7 trophies
---
2- backstab your teammate and have less chances of ending in the best 3
---
It sucks when you have 8 stars but your team's bull just suicides every 4 sec giving them a hearty 14 stars
---
I use android. Upper right hand corner, 3 dots, the options/settings button. Then click flair, there will be a list you can set.

This mortis is a disgrace to Mortis kind he does not even deserve to have his m capitalized

I doubt it honestly. I feel like this one would be very small if so though. Only so much they can do in such a small time frame.
---
I‚Äôm 2927 and have lvl 9 dyna
---
In some supercell games both players get a loss...

300 isn't high enough for teaming to be a big problem. I only notice it around 450 trophies and even up there it's only occasionally

# DR. KAVAN POCO
---
Get over it, there's bothing you can do
---
Not to mention the fact that its a time consuming threat that can leave your safe exposed
---
Since, dagger+poison =560, total damage would only increace by 12.5%. I do agree that respawn times need a small nerf. If they were to change the ammo bar on carl, his reload would stay similar but getting hits would be a bit easier and not annoying like it is right now, unless you have SP. He should get a speed buff if they keep the ammo the same as that would also make hits easier, maybe tank speed. Cool SP idea and thanks for the feedback!
---
You need to be able to get everywhere, or you could literally just hide in an island the whole time.
---
I'm just trying to cheer him up a little
---
Clutch lol
---
^ Yeah mate contact these guys,  they are the main managers of the BS Team.
---
Nice name lol
---
If something goes wrong? You mean if they try to backstab? Well that wouldn't be backstabbing, that would be fighting back. I mean you can use whatever playstyle you want but me personally I despise backstabbing, I'm a very nice and honest teamer 
---
I lost brain cells reading this
---
Gene sounds so friggin cute!

There you go, you gotta stop playing barley in showdown dude

Before it was possible to get dyna and bo from the brawl box.

The wait is killing me

Yay! Thx bro a shelly is always good for me :), now for the drawing part shading perfect, drawing amazing, I admire you for drawing good the shotgun (I struggle drawing weapons :p) and also face is kinda weird but hey faces are one of the most difficult things to draw, practicing is the only way. And you didn't forgot the bandaid :D! Nice work overall. üëçüèº

Frst i thought it was fake..as it was a screen shot then wen i saw the vid u attached..mahn..u have got real talent...hope u make more drawings!!

I would like to draw like you and make skins you could show us how you do it even though I can only make maps but that is another roll you could teach us.

I am a very dishonest teamer. I make it a point that all the powercubes we come across are mine, and that they are merely lucky people that I chose to spare. As for what I mean by "if something goes wrong," it's kind of like if I need their powercubes to win a fight against another anhold (brawlers usually will be too chicken to help me defeat someone who has a good amount of cubes).
---
PS: I respect you honesty and confidence about you teaming. I bet that this gives you a lot of downvotes in this subreddit

Not wrong. Tara's super caused this.

His skill level has little to do with the outcome

We really dont deserve him
---
It sadly isn't 2.8 either
---
Lol i cut that part out now
---
The idea is good, but star player is meaningless in some gamemodes. It's based off how much damage u do, so u could potentially feed in bounty but still do the most damage and get rewarded for bad play

No

I didn't know that ahri's ball did 1.5 times the dmg if it hits the same champion for the second time. Thnx for the info
---
Ahem ‚Äúgallowboob‚Äù

---
I think a player rating system may work. And then people with bad ratings get put with others that have bad ratings. Good ratings with other good ratings etc.
---
The biggest issue with things like this is people abusing it and defeating the purpose.
---
Just stop playing when you start losing 
---
Aiming Pam‚Äôs super ._.
---
Thanks!
---
No teamers under 300
---
Not likely
---
That crow is a spy! Quick, what‚Äôs the closest thing to a pyro in this game?!
---
This is chemistry üòé 
---
Maybe a way to buff crow is to rework how he poisons other brawlers. My idea is to boost the damage he does depending on how many knife hit the adversary.  
---
For example: (Crow level 10)
---
1 knife hit - 1/4 base damage x 4 (392 + 392 overtime)
---
2 knife hit - 2/5 base damage x 4 (784 + 627 overtime)
---
3 knife hit - 3/5 base damage x 4 (1176 + 941 overtime)
---
But with the condition that if you hit the target again before the tics count ends, it will restart taking into account the number of knives that hit the opponent this time. In order to be clever and patient when attacking  like an assassin.

This sucks so hard. Happened me 3 times that the ball was a little bit over the enemy goal line but not 100% and it wasnt a goal. These "special rules" are killing me...

Same happened to me in BB where this one Rico keeps purposely shooting the ball into our goal. These people really need to be banned.

Not a bad idea but it's kinda not fair.

Alright. I have to say, it was partly your fault that you lost to 3 pipers.

Yeah... it would probably be better with smaller team spawns and bigger center island

Stick three forks in me, i'm done.

And it'll make unfair for Piper then since she's the only brawler with the fewest option to be reliable enough to play on the all available events.

Hi, do you have your player tag? I'll have a look!

You looked I assume? Want more forbidden knowledge? Piper‚Äôs eyes are closed throughout the entire match. Meaning she essentially hits her shots blindfolded.
---
Sorry üòìüòì
---
***HOW***DO YOU MAKE LETTERS SMALL
---
yup... :P
---
Imo, she have to keep enemy far away and then it's normal if she isn't the best at dodging
---
not really. she is good against assassins and tanks. buff them and shelly will be meta. 
---
FYI These topics are best directed to me, not Frank, Dani or Ryan.
---
I think SUPERCELL mentioned something about it taking up too much space. But I'd like to have replays under 400 too, maybe even just 300 would make the it better; it seems like a better place of where it should be to me. 
---
Hmm u got a point
---
Lets suppose tou are going to buy 300 power points... If you brawler can get 300 power points, it will fill the power bar normally. However, if your brawler needs 200 power points to reach level 9 (max level), the other 100 power points will turn gold to you.

---
I want to know what happens when you step on the spring with the ball
---
Wow GEDI-KOR you always amaze me with your creativity! This looks great! (Ps notice me senpai)
---
really cute:D
---
In Brawl Mart, there is dinsaur darryl, puppet bear, arcade gun etc. ü§£ü§£
---
And that Is when? According to how many boxes Ive opened my luck meter would be through the roof for epic brawlers. 
---
He knows baby language!
---
such a cute skin! :D
---
Me too
---
So cute art is it
---
just be patient then, not everyone has to be ready when you say so.
---
where did u do all of these
---
I love this guy in showdown. Doesn't matter if I'm a 0 Powerup Poco, I'll go for him and then die.
---
Crow is already annoying to deal with 
---
Most people are using him wrong, its alright of you don't manage to kill enemies because they're gonna be pushed back anyways, thats his job 
---
This is a bug
---
The chances for epic brawlers do not increase, only the legendary chances. It's 100% luck. It can happen today, tomorrow, or in a month. You will get them eventually.
---
It was for carl...got him in the 2nd box btw üòé
---
Season reset
---
Yeah you suck
---
i love this
---
Trrreee
---
_The hardest choices require the strongest wills._
---
Yep
---
that hurt a radius of 5 meters of people around me
---
I really like how your art style vhanges over time. It really gives a fresh vibe every time you post new art! Keep it up! ü§ó, i guess?
---
Shelly charges her super quickly and can burst down the walls. 
---
NEW BRAWLER CONFIRMED
---
I think a basketball game mode is coming, where you shoot the ball like a thrower.
---
Shelly doesn‚Äôt need a buff. Not because she isn‚Äôt weak at higher trophies, she is, but because she‚Äôs a starting Brawler and because she dominates lower trophy gameplay. The first Brawler you get in the game doesn‚Äôt need to be competitively great, especially when Nita, Brock, Jessie, and even Bull are all in good to really good positions right now and you get them all fairly soon after Shelly. Buffing Shelly only makes her more infuriating to play against for newer players, and considering how good she already is there, it could straight up cause people to stop playing the game. Shelly is everything she needs to be. She‚Äôs the first Brawler you get, she‚Äôs an extremely low skill cap Brawler, and she‚Äôs good at killing tanks, something newer players are likely to have problems with. 
---
No need to change what isn‚Äôt broken. 
---
I wish I could do more than just upvote this comment
---
Damn your young eyes
---
he is better than carl?üò≠
---
This was already posted before though...
---
If the timer didnt keep going down when the enemy scored a goal then youd have enough time for this goal to count
---
yeah and crying about it on reddit will definitely make a difference
---
Removed - Your post is too short, please expand on your title.
---
Yea

When the poison is expanding it does not deal damage IIRC

There‚Äôs not enough cute skins in BS I love this skin, the bears eyes are too good!

What're dubs stand for?

So to close the loop on this case, I have checked all the details on this account and found that the account was locked not a week ago, but only 3 days ago on the 24th March 2019 as a hacked case and was waiting for correct verification from the account owner (Point 1). We have not received the answers we were expecting from any account claimants - so the account has stayed locked.  
---
Also upon inspection, the account displays **very clear evidence of being a sold account** (Point 2)**.** Now I am not going to elaborate, but Point 1 and Point 2 here are also clearly linked to each other. This leads me to Point 3, you have claimed that you have been "robbed of $500 by Supercell". Checking your account, there are no transactions listed, which means ZERO money has been spent on this account in-game. So to say we *robbed* you is completely untrue. If you bought the account for $500 (which is a huge NO NO), then we can't be held accountable for that.
---
To end, this account is in clear breach of Supercell's [Terms of Service](https://supercell.com/en/terms-of-service/) \- sharing, buying or selling accounts is not cool, and we reserve the right to lock and ban accounts we find to be in breach of these terms.

So cute

Nice and wholesome 
---
I can relate to this
---
nerf shelly's super but buff her basic attack
---
*no*
---
That‚Äôs cute af
---
Wow, that's actually a simple but brilliant idea, so many robots dying, many power cubes, will also affect teaming, but it won't be added anytime soon lol
---
First of all I reply to bad English so this is not spam
---
Thank you!üî•
---
This is the most creative Nita skin I have ever seen. Amazing twist on the typical *pet* aspect by changing it into a puppet!
---
It reminds me Razz and Rags from Kingdom Rush series. Good Job thoüòÑüëç
---
Is this official?
---
That's insane. Good luck to him! 
---
No her having 31 does not prove your point, that shes good only with super, in the slightest.
---
Someone broke their phone today...
---
Darryl and Bull are gonna be beasts in this
---
you expect to attack mercilessly woth mortis non-stop cuz no reload needed? that why the reload is there, so you dont do such a thing that couod also make mortis op.
---
also unless you just happen to be in a round with only throwers no one can be killed in less than 3 shots, 4 at most. (only exception is showdown)
---
Autocorector Rusty not Risty sorry
---
You're legit the best
---
I Need this :] 
---
lolllll
---
the rektttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt

ü§£
---
 This map reminds me that I used to read Supercell as Sup - Erc - Ell.
---
So near 40?
---
It‚Äôs so fluffy! I‚Äôm gonna die!
---
Yeah and idk what they did to the ball after dec 2018 update but the ball acts so unnatural now
---
Thanks for comment i'll be more good with your comment 
---
Oh,i'm of Brazil,the name of him is dinamike in brazilianüòÖ
---
Why you bully me??
---
Poor Spike :(
---
She/He seem so dessapointed :(
---
Watch to the end with volume on.
---
What, really?
---
Also I didn't really get the joke :I
---
Og music is too good for brawl stars so they had to get rid of it
---
Poor Spike,He/She looks so disapointed :(
---
He didn‚Äôt score lol
---
I know what you mean but I still watched that clip about 20 times. The gas populates the new row at 11 seconds. He gets hit for 1000 damage at :14 on the right side from gas and then at :16 transitions from gas to gas with no damage. Starting at :20 he takes 2000 damage from gas within 2 seconds.
---
This video makes it seem like you can literally stand in gas the whole match, as long as you transition out of fresh gas within 5 seconds. Is that true?
---
It might say like Brawl Ball is gonna be changed or Spike is gonna be nerfed?
---
Best pirate friends, so cute)
---
And Gene‚Äôs lamp!
---
Ooooohhhhhhhh now i see it
---
I have an idea maybe carl once he dies he jumps of his mincart losing 50% of his maximium hp his pickaxe range is lowered and his super duration is lowered by one second  but he becomes morr speedy a bit faster than primo
---
How long does air dry clay last?
---
I love this one! Thanks for sharing it. 
---
Amazing! Would buy it 
---
That‚Äôs a trophy 
---
I dont see Darryl.
---
Why it can give us a reason to play more 
---
We play as a family 
---
Lamo
---
it's because I won 3333 trophies with him,i know,it's a bad joke
---
Hehehe brawlmart
---
Would buy it instantly 
---
Paco is iron man again
---
I‚Äôm so happy for you
---
Again... 
---
That's adorable. 
---
putting a large lake (larger than the one in the video) in the center of every map would be a pretty good solution to teaming.
---
Why? It was a fair match
---
Ay that really good.
---
My badüòÖ

Ok no one look at the typo in the title lol

Lmao im a meme nowüòÇüòÇüòÇ

This Brawler looks like a pilot of some sort so.....
---
Aeron is a TROPHY ROAD REWARD Fighter.
---
Health: 2700 (+92)
---
\[Bomb Bowl\] Aeron tosses a bomb that rolls forward that explodes upon contact with a wall or an enemy, damaging them. Upon explosion, the bomb splits and shoots fragments sideways. (1200) (+75)
---
\[Bombs Away!\] Aeron summons his plane and rises up into the air. Aeron drops bombs in his controllable movement wherever he flies. Lasts 5 secs. (damage per bomb: 800) (+75)
---
STAR POWER - Flight Duos: When Aeron uses his SUPER, any friendly Brawlers (only maximum of 1) within his activation radius will be granted with a flight along with him!
---
Stop bullying that poor Spike!
---
Just bad luck. Since that post I‚Äôve unlocked Pam, Frank, Tara, Leon, Crow, and Carl.
---
I‚Äôm at around 6k trophies now.
---
That‚Äôs actually fax
---
It is a concept bro :)
---
Thanks :D
---
Thanks bro :D
---
This looks really nice!
---
How is the 3d art studying going
---
The feeling you get from opening every box, for me, keeps the game alive. So there's no need to rush the game. Just obtain your dailies, get your tokens etc, and cross your fingers. Statistically, it will happen one day :)
---
flair doesnt checks out
---
Soon...
---
....wow....that's really sad man....
---
Keep up the great work bro, 3D must be hard just keep up the hard work you will get their!
---
But how did he got the xp 
---
Looks really cool other than the map is too small for 5v5. Still, the overall idea is great. And there could be a lot of variations:
---
It could be like Bounty where there's a match time limit.
---
Or It could be like Heist where killing the other boss wins.
---
And If it were bounty, maybe the big boss is only 2x as strong as a normal player and when that player dies, someone else on the team becomes the new big boss.
---
It could be done as 3v3 on a smaller map or 5v5 on a showdown sized map.
---
Crazy ton of possibilities!
---
I win, you lose. Bitch. 
---
My only max is nita and i want a skin but I didn't have gems at the time to buy the christmas and im not too fond of the panda. I would definitely buy this.
---
So true
---
When üïí‚ùì üòï
---
I doubt that dealers would find another way if the anti-spinning script would be programmed perfectly.
---
The lighted in green does not mean who killed more, it indicates your statistics and the two of blue are those of your teammates.

(I think that you said, I do not understand English very well sorry: b)
---
Yeah

11/10

Maybe make their own game. Own company idk. They have communication with us a very large base of players.. we can be influenced 
---
Omg please let this become a thing i want to be able to know how bad that el primo really was
---
Yea you‚Äôre right
---
That primo is god awful 
---
But bro this was like 2 months ago
---
10 outta freaking 10
---
Dragon ball z Vegeta reference thx
---
there* ;)
---
Impossibile 
---
Yes I have a lot of Lucy
---
I've seen my opponents defend against our lvl 19 bot, taking just 20% damage.
---
Yeah, he must have lost the required gem grab match
---
Look at the shape of the map it goes by 
---
SUP-Top of the map
---
ERC-Middle
---
ELL-Bottom
---
Looks good
---
Yes please! 
---
There are no shop offers today... Did you record this last week or even earlier?
---
Thanks so much.
---
I NEED THIS!! 
---
It‚Äôs over 9000
---
bushes, go on zig zag, etc. if you don't happen to be walking on a straight line you should be fine, you can also dash to the bullet to take less damage if yoi are close enough
---
I love Lucy
---
I'm getting closer to 6k (5.7k now) and you are telling me I'm not gonna get legendary from mega box? :(
---
Very similar to double swoosh
---
so who's going to pilot
---
Someone pointed put how difficult it could be to push onto someone's IKE to deal damage whipe the mech bots provides support. I made some slight adjustments to make it a little less of a hassle to attack the IKEs. One thing to note is that these walls surrounding the IKE are supposed to be temporary as they could be broken down with most Supers(Colt, Frank, Primo, Shelly, etc.)
---
Thanks, I am going to present it to Make a map Monday
---
Ahhh
---
Cute! &gt;-&lt;
---
There defense musta been a Frank dynamike and Jessie
---
Dm me when u post it
---
6 brawlers above 500 and none of them ever lose 8 trophies when I play sd with them, literally everybody is saying you‚Äôre lying just drop the case buddy
---
Only possible with darryl
---
As a shelly main, im terrifeid of the future of shelly
---
Leon is still open he need a another nerf ...nerf Leon. plz fuckin supercell do it 
---
I did post it a few minutes ago, do you want to check it out?
---
Drilling colt
---
I didn't see that meme i promiss
---
Well he doesn't NEED bushes, but they make him incredibly oppressive. Walls prevent him from getting damaged by most brawlers, but bushes deny vision. I don't know about you, but it's not fun for me when I walk into a bush only to have a shotgun shoved down my throat as soon as I step in. You could always bush check (which increases survival dramatically), but just the fact that it denies vision makes it so good for bull
---
Very soon
---
DOMINATION MODE ENGAGED 
---
It was a Bo, Barley and Penny if I recall correctly.
---
Lucy is a Neanderthal 
---
How do u make your text big or bold ???
---
If its a spring update why he said green instead of pink? And like that video is almost all pink :/
---
WAM BAM HERE COMES PAM
---
ooohhh so cute üòÑ I love the design! I would love to have this skin in the game.
---
That‚Äôs pretty nice too
---
That stylish Crow about to get some good bird pussy

Howly shit this is good

Too tight

You mean cawern churn

So pinky spike was the one who took mortis's hat!
---
That's fortunately untrue.
---
So bad its good
---
Unburden is the name of Hawlucha‚Äôs ability that boost its speed when it consumes its held item
---
wasn't this leaked on an update? I think they said the next update this will happen.
---
It is Drifblim‚Äôs ability as well, that‚Äôs why I named it ‚ÄòUnburden‚Äô.
---
I agree, it is very balanced! 
---
*So Sakura Spike stole da hat*
---
Waiting to actually get Carl be like
---
Yes i would like skin to be added in the PFP system
---
also badges they would be included in the Battle Pass 
---
you talked about in the quiz
---
Use walls to your advantage. If there are no walls in site than you can dodge.One way to do this is fake going one way and going another. 
---
He will jump to mid with low hp soon
---
A good skin not made by Gedi-Kor? What is this madness
---
Yeah bounty.
---
Did anyone notice riochann posted this?
---
Thanks will try this :)
---
Very well thought out. Good concept üëç
---
I think puppeteer doesn't really fit this skin very well. Maybe teddy bear Nita or cuddly Nita would be better
---
Want to play together?

I just posted my first meme (I am from Europe)
---
Ples Buff Crow
---
Colt buff and shelly buff are not needed. I would do that like this: Shelly big super nerf and normal attack buff, poco damage buff, crow damage buff, spike damage nerf, tara damage or star power buff...My balance changes wishes
---
Is that sarcasm? Orrrrrrrrr nah? 
---
So Poco pls
---
I like the idea that it says b_mart üòÇ keep up the good work üñí@GEDI KOR
---
Completely agree! It would be so useful to know if who my teammate was killed by, as oppose to who recently did the damage. Like I know who dealt the damage most recently, but I want to know what *actually* killed them
---
People just salty i proved em Right, eh what did I expect. Most don't take being proved wrong lightly lol
---
wdm this is top tier art

What the hell

Not sure about all the stuff around the edges, but the rest is cool!

Well,that's mortis

Nerf the FUCK out of her super. IMO no super should be stack-able and all should have some sort of cooldown.
---
Gene Gene bizzare adventure
---
My problems with your post. There are more than 2 true tanks. Frank is more of a true tank than primo is, and I‚Äôd even go to say Pam is a tank and possibly even carl. Also, it takes time for them to implement brawlers and make sure they are all balanced. In addition, even buffing the worst brawlers would not eliminate a meta. A meta would still arise no matter what and theres more than just brawlers to make a meta. Maps and gamemodes also define a meta
---
I don‚Äôt team
---
Really cool!!
---
And not even good updates back then...
---
Gedi kor level
---
Nope I totally understand 
---
But nwm skin animations are TOP notch
---
Only hating cuz of there first impression (face)
---
poor Colt
---
True. Just continue to play, if you're really in it for the fun pushing trophies shouldn't be your main concern. You'll get the other brawlers eventually.
---
whats the movie name?
---
I've seen a 0.0096

I agree but nwm have top notch animations

Ppl only hate cuz of their first impression (face)
