But his range is already so wide that he can easily strafe in a wide pattern side to side and still hit you
---
Rico - Problem Occured - (Uses super) - Problem bounced away
---
How?
---
I've thought of this idea before to his Soper would be a blast of lava that flies from out of his head
---
I like the event modifiers because it adds another element but there should be a plain version w/o as well
---
Reasons why this map is bad:
---

---
1. Too many bushes that is hard (impossible) to check
---
2. Spawn location unfairness
---
3. Uneven chest spawning location
---
(Too many chests spawn at places with bush)
---
4. The name of this map is wrong it should be renamed to ‚Äòbull-Shelly paradise 2.0‚Äô
---
At least there is less teaming than usual in this map
---
That pic is the stuff of nightmares. . .
---
Yeah, you're right. I'll just probably shut up
---
Overwatch made money off cosmetics, not p2w features. I would gladly pay *money* for a non p2w Supercell game.
---

---
True.... I‚Äôll cover for 2k players then
---
r/antiduriusbrawlsatrs
---
Hurry and waste ur money üòÇ
---
It‚Äôs definitely stolen art. Take a look at the profile.
---
If you have to worry about missing him, you're probably too close.
---
I.e. Brock, Colt, Piper, Penny, Gene, etc. will all hit him outside his range. Primo, Rosa, Bull, Shelly will all be too close to miss or to far to hit. Only midrange brawlers like Nita or Carl would have to worry about that.
---
Wow That's open
---
I mean, I view them less as classes and more as ‚Äòunique‚Äô titles. I doubt anyway besides Bibi will be another Batter
---
TARA WANTS TO KNOW YOUR LOCATION
---
This is so cute*^*
---
Penny, and Rosa: Are we a joke to you?
---
How do you backstab with Poco??
---
It‚Äôs supposed to be something you think is true but many people disagree with, like back in the day when buff crow was a meme you‚Äôd right ‚Äú crow doesn‚Äôt actually need a buff you guys just suck ‚Äú or something song those lines. If this was supposed to be satirical then you should make that more clear because I couldn‚Äôt really tell and I‚Äôm sure many others couldn‚Äôt either.
---
That‚Äôs that one evil spike boi
---
Thats how you know colt needs a buff, the only reason ppl dont complain is bc he has a high dps for his range but he is not good in bushes and he is not good long range and only good at mid range (if you hits atleast most of the shots consecutively)  dont get me wrong im at 7.3k and colt is my favorite brawler thats why i got him to 535 last season (185 place for USA) was hard tho
---
It's actually his pie-baking wife. They are old so they have to take turns in the arena.

Tbh I don‚Äôt play siege at all
---
My bad sorry
---
But I think the majority of us want a Tara remodel
---
Shelly op
---
shouldn't a dead body look like a dead body
---
It IS a dead body üòÇ
---
I suppose so, as long as he doesn‚Äôt get a damage buff I think he‚Äôd be good.

I think need to reduce the bushes ,don't let bull overpower

---
Well why?
---
all my other brawlers have 260-300 trophys
---
Yeah, I had the same idea when I first saw Tara die. Good post
---
Screw you! I'll never unsee that now.
---
Yes same with when gene pulls a newly spawned pan turret
---
Utterly Perfected in every way.
---
I thought the joke was that you swapped them so Leon is ‚ÄúToxic assasin‚Äù because it makes you toxic when he kills you in solo out of no where, and Crow is dashing because you can never catch him as he poisons you.
---
I think the entrance to the middle must bigger ,if no the sharpshooter always targets that bushes
---
the bushes are literally the main focus here, plus there are gaps in the bushes so you can spot enemy brawlers trying to make their way to the safe
---
"perfectly balanced, as all things should be"

---
What is the true name of the meme(what it is based from
---
oops I spelled dynamike wrong
---
"Fans". Wow, this random user at Reddit thinks he has fans lol
---
Second, this post is totally unrelated to the game. You should be banned by doing these kind of posts
---
Read the comments people have identified it as his unless you can prove otherwise.
---
But I have to give some credit to supercell, at least they buffed crow, 'listened' to the community most of the time but they need to work in endgame content since once you get every brawler maxed and at 500 trophies, there is simply nothing to do unless you wanna play competitive and hoping to find top players to play with because there is physically no way to push with tendons all the way to 1K trophies on one brawler for example It usually takes an excessive amount stress)
---
Because of watermark? People have looked into it says it is OP's

 It's just that they innovated so they were able to plan it out better because its much further in the future

And what's wrong with that?

I actually think Poco absolutely not fits Sans by Personality. I know Poco is the most similiar to Sans, but his personality is more energetic than Sans one. Also, i think Spike fits more Flowey as he is a plant.

Thank you for this post,  this actually made my day so much better,  as of now I'm headed to late to school by approximately 40 mins. And it's the first day of finals , so thank you atleast this made me happy today

EW. DISGUSTING.

Haha, I think it's great that you "blocked" the corners. That way no annoying Penny can place her turret there.

I hear you man. One guy in my class got Spike and Crow at 2k. My friend has everyone except Bibi and legendaries. Another guy has 2 accounts, both 2k and he got Crow and Spike on both of them, and my friend that got me hooked up with this game had a 0.00 something legendary chance yet got Leon and Carl after. Me? 7.6k trophies, play everyday, recently opened 20 brawl boxes and 2 big ones. Had a 0.14 legendary chance. Guess what? Got NOTHING. I'm literally in the same boat as you(just switch Tara with Mortis). Played ever since global. Hang in there man, it's not much, but know that you are not alone and that brawlers don't matter, but SKILL.

---
Guys who play mortis in heist and hanging around without damage.
---
Because you are F2P
---
What does that have to do with anything?
---
Tottal thropy count
---
Lol that was my first though but this made a better picture
---
Assimetrical
---
It's a little hard to tell what is going on with the spawnpoints. Only 8 grey that I counted and four green?
---
Other than that it's really cool.

Ik ga stuk üòÇ

xFort... and Vbucks... ladies and gentlemen, this guy killed Fortnite

I literally only got my second mythic a couple days ago and I‚Äôm at 5k

Wouldn't it be nice if we were older. Then we wouldn't have to wait so long?

Bo will start his own rap career

This is after Penny and Darryl tried _Sea of Thieves_.

Lol same
---
Tbh life leach doesn‚Äôt even sound great. Sounds like the tanky brawlers  can just camp till a squishy brawler comes trying to gain health back. It‚Äôd basically close showdown only to More Hp brawlers
---
too pretty for pain
---
Heheheh

#This could be

#EyeOfTheStormV2.0
---
I got no mythics 1 legy and  3 epics
---
Before auto aim this was pretty common. Nevertheless, well done Sir...
---
shelly doesn t need a nerf cuz She is a weak brawler but her super is macking She special
---
a shelly without a super is easy to kill with every brawler in the game

dragonball

I can't beat the shit out of you without getting closer!!!
---
Ooooo satisfying

Updoots*

but he is good, you just don‚Äôt know how to play ‚Äòim lol
---
How come you make the same mistake twice lol
---
This would be 10x funnier if the names were switched.
---
500 trophy crow that played like trash. Ridiculous lol. That crow could have won the game easily at least 3 times.
---
pathetic asshole(hope they fix this)
---
Well played
---
They weren't even teaming
---
D I O

r/lostredditor

But the real question is:
---
#WHY 
---
is there not a hat?
---
Hopefully in the next update
---
El primo is a god after all...
---
I expect nothing and get nothing. Perfect.
---
What show is this meme from?
---
Thanks :)
---
Niceeee
---
he puts a huge twist in his, nobody does it quite like him, at all, on the other hand, Morgz copies Mr. Beast Head to toe
---
Must have felt like playing a bullet hell game haha
---
I was thinking that maybe they should be broken up with some blocks
---
*R/crowgang has invited you*
---
you just used some m8 üëå
---
SpEinIeng In ThE BuSh
---
They weren't teaming they just went for the crow instead of eachother because he was low
---
My disappointment is immeasurable 
---
This should be a thing
---
...rero?
---
Its ok bro...here's a cookie üç™
---
You guys sure like to make the same *joke* over over and again
---
Brawl Stars for you bud
---
5/5
---
no 4444 is the best milestone
---
Yeah completely agree I feel like theres enough brawlers in the game for now any more and it will feel over saturated with many similar brawlers. I cant be the only one wanting new modes, club battles things along those lines.
---
No, for continuous games of bots
---
That‚Äôs what a murderer trying to avoid suspicion would say
---
Rico!üòÜ
---
This is a brug moment
---
Yeah!üòÑ
---
That hole is... long
---
Yes we do, its called recyceling, we dont wanna destroy our earth
---
It's gonna be a  big update because supercell takes a company wide vacay in July
---

---
I am f2p i got spike at 3.5k now i have 7.5k
---
Thicochet is thiquer
---
Yeah I was aware of this just dont want to get mt hopes up and them to just drop another brawler with more maps and skins :/
---
Yeah, i think the buff mortis thing is just people that dont have the skill to play him good cus he has a skill cap
---
Then why do you have leon as your main
---
Rosa still needs a nerf
---
Yeah I didn't like the remodel at all.
---
Beautiful
