Broski, CoMe On BiBi Is ObViOuSlY tHe BeTtEr OnE
---
---
---
Twice I played brawl ball and a random purposefully scored two own goals. I looked for about 10 mins for a report button.
---
So your saying you‚Äôd rather have skeletons on the field than the Mega Knight?
---
Me: haha its funny how it happens
---
Apparently everybody else: NO ONE CARES &gt;:(
---
Me except for that fifth Brock skinüò±ü§§
---
don't be so harsh on the kid hes only 12
---
Usually skins have the name of the skin followed by the name of the brawler.  So is the name Bee Bibi?  Or Bumble Bibi?  Or Bee Bee Bibi?  This is truest cursed in the best way possible
---
They have a thicc barrel. Maybe a battery for supercharge?
---
depends on when it‚Äôs used, of course. I‚Äôd rather have it in *my deck*, yes, but in the field, depends on the circumstances
---
I don't even play a whole hour per day and I managed to get all brawlers to 500. I started playing on global launch and I haven't spent a dime.
---
Its confirmed people with mortis flairs are the dumbest people on this sub
---
Yeah I agree on both and just like my randoms they can be good sometimes
---
I think it's related to \[Jojo's bizzare adventure\].
---
Me neither
---
And this is why we need to be able to report people. There are fuckers who won't group with team or stay in a bush aiming at nothing.
---
Fix dynamikes line that says ‚Äúnot bad for an old-teamer‚Äù
---

---
It‚Äôs supposed to be ‚Äúnot bad for an old-timer‚Äù
---
Dont buy her, its just an epic
---
Damn.
---
Rip our fallen brother chickenüôèüôèüôè
---
"crazy laughters"
---
It's the third person in line ibib
---
Feels bad man, 
---
But hey, most of the brawlers you have are actually really strong.
---
Brock, Carl, Colt, Barley, Jessie, Penny, Rico.
---
All of these brawlers are strong and easy to push up even with randoms, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll be able to get higher up with them, getting more trophies will increase your season rewards and earn you additional mega boxes which will increase your chances of getting more brawlers.
---
So I dont have to use Pixel Crux to get them in?
---
wow forgot to add the "S" these are confusing times
---
I don‚Äòt play that much... and I dont think im horrible..
---
No. Most people just use pixel Cruz since it came before the app. Just be sure to most a link to your map on the make a map Monday thread
---
Thx
---
esta usando un tapa rabos osea que cuando ocupe la cosa esa que te manda a volar 7w7
---
I did end up buying it and didn‚Äôt get a lot of people but i opened two boxes, one from the pack and 1 for 60 gems and I only got frank
---
Ik man i was just trying to say i get it im bot trying to start an arguement
---
If people actually *do* like this, I'll try making new map designs and creating a new themed collage. I put a pretty good sum of effort into this, so I hope you all enjoy!
---
Frank was my first epic. He is a beast. If you know how to use him, he is amazing. Brawl ball and siege are two good modes for him at the moment
---
Ok then, end of "chat"
---
Another GEDIKOR masterpiece!
---
It says spoiler lmao. I cant anymore this is so weird.
---
Marked as ***news***
---
Just use "Them" lol
---
True
---
Its wayyyyyyyyy lower then 6% its not even a 1% chance
---

---
And the current map, Eye of the Storm, just has way too many bushes. You basically have to use a short-range Brawler or else you lose.
---
I know. But they didn't update it yet.
---
My question is also sarcastic...?
---
Wow he looks boring
---
Shy guy
---
Yes
---
I feel bad that posts like this get any upvotes. The epitome of laziness

hell no man just imagine how many sweaty bull mains will be in those bushes. Yikes !

Palmas ,_, vc apagou o post anterior so pra botar em ingles,nem coloque os estatus dele porqu√™ a supercell n√£o liga pra ideia de brawler,somente ideias de mapas(e talvez mudan√ßa de balanceamento)

Sorry to hear about that.

If you tap on the Star Level in the Brawler‚Äôs screen, you can see it says ‚ÄúUnlocked in POWER LEVEL 9‚Äù

Uh

For a second i  saw here as sasuke uchiha
---
That Frank was one of the worst randoms you can find... the kinds who use their super to goal although they are literally touching the goal post. If he had just basic attacked it it would have reached inside before the shelly has time to catch it.

No
---
I totally agree and I also have a 3rd point: 3- when I play mortis, I always lag, I don't know why but the attack starts ~0.2 seconds after I attack, and it's very disturbing me
---
I know, it makes me want to beat the shit outta them

This is one of the most stupid things I have ever read.

Also he's thiccer
---
When you unlock a brawler your chances of getting a higher rate brawler goes down
---
This... Is quality content. I would probably buy a skin with that name
---
It was added with rosa update
---
First 350-ish are easy to get in less than 3-4-ish days with pretty much any Brawler.

Meh I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs useful, because there is 6 things to look at.

Dang. Epic. At least she isnt as hard to get as those mythics and legendaries

I did! Check my profile.

The current one for showdown called Eye of the storm

Lol I figured.

Carl is very OP now and you should push him as much as you can... Maybe play him in showdown
---
lol
---
Yeah but they shouldnt make it so normal people have codes, only creators because its support a Creator, maybe ppl with 1-2k subs min
---
I got her from the first out of the two boxes I had kept lol
---
Nah
---
Oh...oh no.
---
It's already in the game, it got added with the rosa update secretly and they didn't mention it on the patch notes.

I love this map
---
You can touch anywhere on the right side of the screen for attack but the super button is just stuck there
---
Period
---
That's true
---
Bold of u to assume tara will EVER get a skin or remodel
---
Brawl Stars system and Clash royale is completely diffrent. Once you unlock a brawler no matter the rarity you will gain power points and you need the same amout of power points unlike cr where its all rng and once you get a legendary you will have to wait just as long to get another. The games arent even comparable.
---
Nah those are fine imo
---
If u die to bulls and shellys constantly then thats ur own fault, they arent hard to deal with.
---
Lion dad:Its OUR GRAVE
---
SO MUCH BETTER
---
Tbh No the map isnt good cause of the small trees in the way no offense though
---
Lol only been playing 2 months and I have 22/26 brawlers. (Don't have Bibi or legendaries)
---
Half of the map is just shelly

guy that makes those vids here, hi

Yup bro

While Pam can be the meta with her camping turret, and Gene with his overtime,

Can't agree with this more... It isn't even about the losing, but how you lose because of something stupid. If you can't aim with colt very well fine, you suck. But if you don't play objectives, you deserve ban imo. There are some stupid as shit people in thus game

That‚Äôs not a game mode, that‚Äôs just a modifier. Teaming will still run rampant in every solo showdown game that doesn‚Äôt have life leech as the modifier.

i said the exact same thing
---
Oh yeah yeah pls
---
that doesnt make any sense considering every showdown map has the majority of boxes usually clumped together in the center. the reason for that is that it gives the mode a high risk high reward system, because farming boxes at the outside of the map is easy and leads to hiding and waiting
---
Thanks, I'm now at 9800 trophies
---
All brawl ball some duos
---
I find her in all possible maps, also on opened maps. That‚Äôs the fault
---
It was a real player
---
Yes. We should not make all brawlers balanced in showdown. You saying that el priomos range increased (1 fucking brawler) in bounty is the same as all brawlers getting "balanced". If some brawlers have high damage they will be BETTER (AGAINST OTHER FUCKING BRAWLERS YOU DUMBASS) than Poco in damage. Kys
---
i couldn‚Äôt  understand a word you said
---
Love the new HD graphics!
---
There is only ONE mode that u don't depend on your teammates, SOLO showdown. Which make it unique. üôåmeanwhile we have lots of different 3v3s, do don't play el primo in bounty, but do can play it in brawl ball. The exact opposite for piper. But in my opinion u have to be able to play all the brawlers in the ONLY SOLO mode in the game. (Cuz there is no other modes for solo play.)
---
Just imagine: you won 11 times in a row... so the game decided to put you up against people of a similar level... its not made to make you lose... if the feature wasn't there, then you would face noobs each time and skyrocket to the top... which will destroy the purpose of a "game" 
---
I think you're the only "slow" person here
---
Wow 9.8k, I have a question. What modes did you play to reach there?
---
No joke, I would legit buy this üòÇüòÇ
---
Atreus
---
5.2k something like that I deleted the game so I can‚Äôt be sure
---
Big Jessie: Dying Party
---
I'm sorry but as far as I see that Piper hits more than you
---
Heyyyy, I remember posting this same image... you really beat me to say bat guy was Bibi now instead of Mortis :B
---
Homerun?
---
What is your nickname on instagram?
---
Solo showdown isn‚Äôt even a competitive mode because it doesn‚Äôt require any skill. You can easily even put the odds by doing something like teaming or bush camping.
---
You literally said is not a feature and now you are saying it is, your first comment was calling me a kid but it looks like you can‚Äôt even do basic reasoning üòÇ stop right here please you are looking idiotic
---
How is the piper and crow one hard?
---
Actually it's a great idea. Never actually thought of it. üëçüèªüëçüèªüòÅ. But I guess it could use a little bit better editing?? Sry if I'm being rude but it's just a suggestion
---

---
i'm at 7.5k and got no legends i need this type of luck!
---
Nice
---
But colt uses pistol.
---
maybe the game isn't for you, should try something simpler like candy crush... it will make you win every time!
---
Yes, that‚Äôs exactly what bounty is to El Primo and Brawl ball is to piper.
---
Ok listen here you little shit 
---
jk
---
Wielki Fina≈Ç
---
How could he forgot Leon :(
---
You can still use piper in brawl ball if you are good enough
---
Where's colt?
---
That‚Äôs amazing
---
Crow isnt OP change my mind
---
Its not a feature to make you lose on purpose, it is there to give you more of a challenge...
---
When you had paid 1.99$ for a skin
---
But she‚Äôs not ideal, that‚Äôs the point. Some brawlers will ultimately be ideal on certain game modes and maps while other brawlers won‚Äôt be.
---
Fair enough but why piper......
---
nice linkin park's lyrics in the title there lol

Indeed it was lost,or you see the same posts everyday? If they didn't get lost we would have the same,small posts that made it to 10K or 15K,they can even be super old. At least i never found it in the front page again. But why people complain? There are stupid posts about the "1 Less Gem" offers and they get annoying and repetitive yet every post get +100 upvotes and,exept for a post about it,nobody said a deam thing.

Yes. Bring it back.

This is excatly the first thing that popped in my head when I read KairosTime's youtube channel name

Oh boy time to crush some skulls

Yeah lol I knew trophy road didn‚Äôt always exist but I thought you would‚Äôve pushed more than 300 trophies lol

Well how do you call a function that makes you lose on purpose, let me tell you: a feature the developers wrote to make the game more balanced! But I don‚Äôt want it to be like this because they are not saying it exists so why would the low key implement it? Give us some informations about it and maybe I can reinstall the game again, they can‚Äôt just hide shit and make me frustrated  af
---
Ok sure. But low damage brawlers should be given a chance to break boxes without getting attacked by a bull or shelly
---
Here, try this game... 
---
https://www.kiloo.com/en/kids-games/
---
All i got out of them up to 7k is rico and gene
---
Also no. It wouldn‚Äôt be fair to high dps brawlers. Think of it this way, if two people were to punch a box, one is skinny and the other is swole af, who do you think would break it faster? It‚Äôs honestly a... not good idea and contradicts many things regarding S-showdown.
---
You should put spinner under him XD 
---
Got it?
---
Ght
---
Guess imma make som money then
---
F-Mega
---
The only thing that I am saying is that current system gives the Tanks (like Bull, Shelly, Rosa,...) Too much advantage for boxes. Have u ever tried gene in solo showdown, when u are still trying to open your first box, other brawls are opening there 3rd or 4rd. (U have to spend 20 seconds for single box,  other spend 5 seconds )
---
New 5v5 sneak peek
---
Grammar ? "It's" wins against "Its"
---
Yeah but it doesn‚Äôt solve the money problem
---
Looks like you know many of these games probably I‚Äôm not the kid here üòÇ why are you digging you‚Äôre own grave???

So you are saying that you should go up against noobs everytime you play...so you can easily win....

He doesn't need a buff
---
Buff his range by 5%
---
What the actual frick are you guys talking about? This is the BEST showdown map because long and close range brawlers are both viable
---
the could in return just release skins mor frequently, this would balance it out
---
For Showdown you have to play him on the right maps( skull creek, Rockwall brawl, stormy plains).   He works in brawl ball as long as you use your shots well enough. He was always bad at heist which is OK since he shouldn't be op in everything.  Again he isn't too good in siege. As for bounty target dynamikes on maps like Excel, Layer Cake, Bull Pen and even Hideout
---
F for crow
---
that's why i call this map as Island Invasion 2
---
Not everyone is as good as you then I have good aim but a moving around el primo will be difficult especially if he‚Äôs farting into a bush and it‚Äôs low ranked
---
Royal runways is the worst map, seems like there are only 12 boxes on the entire map

Not this lvl. We meant lvl 1
---
i know nat and i‚Äôve never seen her make any content lol

Thanks, Im so shocked! I went to sleep and it was at 180 upvotes, wake up, 2.7k upvotes!!?? HOLY!!

I had a Gene pull me to a power 20 bull right as they died to the bull in duo showdown and this reminded me of it.
---
thanks.

That brawler in bush at right side

 Not the reason why but, that still works

Of course they are afraid, you can end someones life instantly if they are close enough
---
Every time I try to cut the video it crashed so I had to upload the whole thing

Have you ever seen a penis?
---
Best tip is to not play Shelly, she‚Äôs shit
---
hAhA bEcAuSe hEs iNvIsIbLe :DDDdd
---
uh what?
---
Life leech just makes showdown worse for close range brawlers and better for long range brawlers who are already good in SD. They have solved teaming with the energy drink and mushrooms, which isn't too big of a step but they partially solved it.
---
I would trade 100 trophies for a star powered brawler any day. But yeah, framers suck
---
Lmao you stupid
---
Another community piper map

Look it‚Äôs 69

Maybe because some of the bushes like the bushes on the outside is literally impossible the check until the smoke covers 90% of it, and this is coming from a 13k player. This map had more thought into how cool it is than thinking about the gameplay.

Dude what would it be called

Play dynamike for siege...god i cant tell how easy it is... Not so much skill or effort but great prize
---
Unless you can play solo then just stop playing the brawler and playe him or her the next day atleast you will be fresh
---
You can contact supercell support team and tell them about the name , lv and code maybe they will help you
---
Indubitably
---
I never got that excited anyways, the dynamike did carry, that‚Äôs how we won, he was the best on our team, if I went afk, of course we didn‚Äôt win because of me, the dynamike was star player, of course he carried.

RIP headphone users

You literally answered your question, private servers are private so you can‚Äôt play with people in the normal servers and supercell responded btw

Yea this happened in a match i was in as well. I took pity and stuff near the edge of the river so he charged his super and came back out. And killed me.

:(

Jk. He came out killed everyone. 2 brawlers were left, me and him. He surrendered.

Btw, we're friends now.

You‚Äôre wanting us to stop saying buff Mortis?

Wow someone totally didn‚Äôt already post this and you totally didn‚Äôt copy it a few weeks later... -_-
---
I can agree that some people just spam their attacks to approach the enemy. But he has a slow reload and low damage that means he can only kill low health brawlers like barley, dyna, piper etc.
---
I feel like people want him to be a tank buster because of his range, but that‚Äôs not his role at all. Whenever I see people in my club who think Mortis needs a buff, I watch them play him. It‚Äôs their play style with him that needs buffing.
---
that is the thing who break this mode
---
Maybe D.Mike?

why the epics and not the mythics?

Ok calme down and eat your dynamikes

Quality content! üëå

Nope
---
#MORTIS JUST NEEDS A REWORK! NOT A F****** BUFF!!!
---
I‚Äôm not I‚Äôm just a random guy
---
Mortis absolutely does not need a buff. If you buff his range or reload, he will always be able to run away. If you buff his health or damage, he will start killing brawlers that he really shouldn't. Same thing if you buff his super/SP. If you were going to gice Mortis a "buff", you could only really nerf his counters, although this idea of letting him get around corners is ok, as it will help the lower players who use autoaim
---
Yes.

Yeah about 3-5

Check bushes.

He can easily kill low and medium hitpoints brawler if u approach them correctly. For tanker it's a bit more complicated, in showdown you can kill tanker if you are a good power cube stealer (XD), in 3v3 u can just wait till tanker used all ammo or having not so much hitpoints, how good Mortis in 3v3 is also depended on how good ur team work.
---
Also i don't think 900-1260 damage/main attack is considered as "small"
---
Thanks
---
I know made him myself xD
---
How?

Ikr lol

Nice repost man. Real credit goes to u/tsunderehaven

Wasn't this already a feature for Nita that was removed? Are they bringing it back?

The only difference between them is that spike has no problem at killing skeletons (Poco) while Frisk/Chara... might need some helpüëÄüòë
---
That contained information about retropolis and the fact that it was a 50s-60s era diner, not 70s. Also, may I ask, is Franks description still contain "70s kid"? Because if it does, it mean HE WAS BORN THEN, and it's not a teaser. I'm finished here
---
He?
---
Have some Respect dude 
---
The creator took time to make the map NOT to get hated
---
Everyone requesting buffs seems to have one thing in common....they‚Äôre playing team brawlers in solo showdown. #buffsoloshowdownplayersbrains
---
Jessie of course.
---
I‚Äôm f2p but I just don‚Äôt use most brawlers so I got this
---
Lol, even colt's dps is higher, maybe you can't count?
---
No, he doesn‚Äôt need a big, he needs a FIX. His attacks don‚Äôt register often even if the white aim indicator is touching a brawler. There was a video posted a while back showing mortis and how even if the corners of his attack are touching a brawler, the attack still won‚Äôt hit, whereas Rosa‚Äôs attack doesn‚Äôt even have to be touching at the longest peak to hit all three shots
---
&lt;3
---
Oof
---
Tihis is very good
---
It's Jessie the reason it has an extra 400 health is becuase Jessie has one power up (400 health)
---
Crows fine
---
GUYS I'LL FINISH IT OFF, BOT PRACTICE ROUNDS DON'T HAVE HIGH RARITY BRAWLERS, SO THEREFORE THAT IS A JESSIE.

Yep. Made it for a friend first. Looked a hour for effects and applied them to the idea in my head. You can see my previous post with this wallpaper

its not that mortis is bad, its that hes so goddamn situational that other brawlers can do his job much better than he can.

with the abysmal reload speed and range he definitely needs a buff

I tried hundreds of times and it didn't work so yeah probably
