Yea so it just takes time, even if he got 1st every game itd still take a few hours, it‚Äôs more about the time dedication

Lucky guy: hey! You stole my brawl box!

You are all talking about the kid but this is technically the mom‚Äôs (or dad‚Äôs) fault because they let him play so much.
---
I bot both of them wen acreching solo first came out it took 6 days fore it to be in my shop

No one will use! Is low effort!

Thx!

Ohhhh I get the joke, I thought it was that Darrell not hitting the small bots

***8-BIT REMODEL IN OCTOBER UPDATE***
---
Isn‚Äôt that basically primo plus brock
---
Thanks for answering
---
That happens with a lot of Brawlers, it's very curious.
---
Try Jessie, or Penny... Many other Brawlers.
---
And also... Try Crow and Spike.
---
Crow: If with super, you hit the robot with all the dagues, it will show a big number. I remember when I tried lvl 1 Crow there, and it dealed like 5000+ damage. Even more, but I don't remember exactly. 
---
And even more if, before you hit it, the robot is poisoned. That deals more damage.
---
And Spike, if you perfectly hit the robot, it can deal 3060  (or 3360, I don't exactly remember) damage. Lvl 1 Spike.
---
I would give you a gold if i had coins
---
She is the only brawler that can‚Äôt hit more than 1, so now, if this idea was implemented, there will be a new standard for all new brawlers, which will be nice to see
---
Yes you did
---
I would call "Phoebe".
---
Just make it happen supercell. We don't need any area damage with it. We just want to see Piper hitting primos Shelly's, bulls on their heads. The damage would be same, but we need that animation change
---
You just said a thruth. Most of the time a jessie actually gets a big time on big game because people are either to scared to attack her or rage quit.
---
[fixed it](https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/dhjpfx/petition_to_put_zomgs_to_brawl_stars/)
---
Yeah ur my friend i know u
---
Ok dude, now you gonna have to do one of these for every brawler lol

Good work.

Thanks

I agree and also they should make brawlers in take down faster(everyone will have the same speed tho) and make it so the Robo stays in one area
---
Actually, he is kinda bad. Look at all of his hard counters in there! Bull, primo, shelly just to name a few.
---
*_NO_*
---
True, it is nerve-wracking if your match gets featured in Brawl TV, with 700+ players watching your every move
---
They should make that like when the robot is like across the map you get a speed bonus to get to him
---
Bruh don't ask support for ideas, they're there to help you not take ideas
---
Yes:v
---
Happy cake day
---
its not a repost... its a template for making memes, that doesnt count as a repost. nobodys done this yet
---
Tf? So now no one can play it?
---
Yes and also make it so that you can only attack brawlers when everyone is at the robo
---
^uwu
---
When he spots its the first 4 beats of the theme
---
The mom is Tara too... big F
---
average
---
Maybe it will only repair 450 damage or something like that?
---
Probably like an hour.
---
Not to mention the smallest hit box in the game I think.
---
Ouch, I blowed me butt off
---
#YES
---
Maybe cause she doesn't have training for those
---
Thats mean

I don't know)

I was very confused until I turned on the audio

o ok thank you for explaining

My game was laggy that time

True

I died inside and got sandy

Ummm dude you ok? It‚Äôs watermarked lol. Also OP is the artist, amazing job OP!

But Sandy hasn't been released for 8 months?

It depends on your skin, it sounds weird but its just like getting a sun burn, it effects some people way more than others
---
no
---
lol jOkE
---
have you never watched a 20th Century Fox Movie?
---
Thx
---
Any update that introduces a new brawler does this. It raises the casual bracket by 500 and the competitive bracket by 700. The trophy balance just made the difference between the brackets more severe. And that‚Äôs nearly enough to be in the top 1% (14.1k last we heard).
---
Too many people in this sub don‚Äôt realize that most players don‚Äôt even have 5 digits. This place just has a really high saturation of high trophy players.
---
Mine too.
---
**heavy breathing intensifies**
---
Dont worry dude,..it happens to alot of people,its not because you are dumb ,its just confusion ;D
---
OF COURSE HE IS LOSING
---
He got no fingers left
---
This is just a joke don't take it seriously.. -_-
---
such a waste, best way to spend ur tickets is Robo Rumble.. u can get 32 tokens per tickets pretty easy
---
She quietly laughs and waves at you
---
**Harvard wants to know your location**
---
Its probably fake and everyone just fell for it
---
no unless u would like to be hit by mr.bat
---
Reeeeepost
---
So you were the jerk who just jumped around than rather help us win
---
Nice vid though
---
What about people who accidentally on goal like when they are auto aiming at an enemy and their teammate passes the ball to them so they auto aim the ball into their own goal
---
Ofc at 2k trophies
---
This certainly didnt happen, but imagine being a parent who lets your 6 year old spend $3000 on a video game, rip his fingers apart while playing and then blames the game, lol that has nothing to do with brawl stars its just lazy, careless, terrible parents. 
---
If it was real this child was probably baby Lex
---
they should put more spring traps in takedown maps so you can get to the boss faster
---
iTs DyNaMiKe
---
**I would wave back at her**
---
all I simply do is not believe
---
Ouch... lol
---
Why does the ball have cum stains on it.
---
Read it carefully, its just a visual thing, just an alternative attack animation for close range :)
---
On a random note how is your real life going
---
This also makes her no longer unique from all other brawlers
---
But piper shouldnt be buffed in close range because every brawler needs to have weaknesses or else its not balanced.
---
Thats like giving elprimo a 8 tile range attack to compete with other long range bralwers.
---
The ÏãúÎèÑÌïòÎã§ means to try something,

Better that than loving them blindly
---
ooo yes this would be great
---
epic :D
---
Yeah but still pretty trash somehow
---
Pretty sure it will do the same amount of damage as now, but simply + area damage
---
dont mess with devito
---
Yeah basically you stay behind and chip on your opponents, Tara is basically useless until her super comes to play,and when you have her super, make sure you have all three amino slots full before using it if not it will probably go to waste
---
Now make it fat and have its head pop off instead.
---
Thanks!
---
Yeah its just an aesthetic thing
---
Wait really?
---
I didn't know bots are that good lmao

Okay
---
Imagine all that trouble to push a wall and then a Shelly comes out of nowhere and supers the whole block.
---
It's at 69 comments oops I made it my bad I'm deleting this comment

Thats a great idea except sans main attack should NOT go thru walls

Shes probably bushcamping

So I AM the toxic one? AGAIN, I said I'm a proud Shelly main, got downvoted and hate comments, AND I'M TOXIC. YEAH.

Thank you for making my day happy

Same here 13.5k no legys
---
Correct about first x number of boxes, but my brother didn‚Äôt unlock any super rare until 1.5k, and I didn‚Äôt get epics until 6k. There probably is a guaranteed rare though
---
I am not, thats why i said: 
---
&gt;Fine. You wanna hate their support team? go ahead. Whatever man
---
But you are the one who is still refusing to let go of this conversation, it seems like you are one of those guys who want themselves to be the one that puts the last words in to look like they won the argument. If thats the case then come on, put your last words in and end this conversation
---
if your good you can play throwers in open map, honestly idk why im still talking to a dumbass like yourself
---
Yeah ofc, but u mostly auto aim with Shelly
---
It‚Äòs cool ,Yu reare aa clever boy.
---
Yeah I can't disagree with that, but it's still can't be removed
---
pp
---
bruh you go away and never use reddit u fucking russian
---
Chill out fam, the only reason i went full out is because i know kids will deffend the thing they like even if its bad, so i was testing you a bit.

Nice
---
Already did it, my first power 9 brawler at 7k trophies smh ...
---
 Song name?
---
Exactly! I‚Äôve also seen this like 2 months ago
---
But you can do lone star
---
Edit:on second thought I won't make the character
---
Cuz it to hard and I can't draw
---
Sorry, my tired eyes cant read this post
---
Sorry to burst bubble kid but sc is not going to add your idea 99% of ideas in this sub are not even added in thr game
---
Shelly can be a metric mile away from me and her bullet can barely graze my ballsack but her super will paralyze me from the waist down and just leave me with my pants down waiting to get piped by a Bull with a raging chubby
---
Yes, also it's extra **nice**.
---
Not really.
---
No, but you cn use octopus launcher as well...
---
I will tell u to not post shit content
---
This is basically people complaining about piper's eyebrows or that wizard Barley's head is slightly sticking out of his hood
---
It is not the game's fault that parent is just not responsible for his/her child
---
what about being able to charge his super by healing with normal attack.
---
Lmao
---
I just lost 100 brain cells
---
#ZA HANDO
---
Stop with The Sans Poco thingy, Poco is much more energetic than Sans. I actually think you should do the Spinel - Mortis Animation instead
---
At least i posted it thay may post it
---
Your piper icon gives me nightmares
---
Honestly it‚Äôs the parents fault and it‚Äôs the parent who deserves a 1 star rating, not a five star rating
---
why
---
I dont know fortshite !?! Anyways can suggest some improvements ??
---
Ye 3v3 game is fun at low trophies but you had to get competitive and an organized team at higher trophies because randoms are so bad
---
I knew I forgot something.
---
I like to shroud myself in mystery.
---
Ambush was overly buffed. 500 is enough 600 is even better. +800 to his max attack is too much
---
Ok, and when she return back she return to deal -2000
---
Why can't i inform them.The kids want to know.Also since you removed my post I'll post it in other ways
---
Im really curious how to enter or have access to that game files thingy. But the comment always gets removed
---
And he can walk the ball to the goal
---
But ive had piper at power 9 for almost a month now and colt for at least 3, i just dont understand how i have a lower chance to get the brawlers than star powers and i get the brawlers
---
This concept has already been proposed.
---
:D
---
Just take my upvote
---
Why sport shoes not Japanese slippers?
---
I would be awful at this; great idea, sounds like a winner!
---
How about power level? Would it try to match brawlers with the same amount of trophies or power level or rank?
---
This could be, however his response was a direct response from the same topic I was talking about. Thank you for looking out!

This could as you said be a ‚Äúno no‚Äù or this could be a big deal! Especially for the players who started playing any supercell games with clash of clans. This could be a good thing too! Thank you for the ideas!

Wut?
---
Wow! That's epic! Good job!
---
He‚Äôs the fastest walking speed in the game
---
See? They are not bots, they are actually employees they do read our messages
---
Also thats an awesome brawler ideai would like to know how aiming and attacking works for her
---
Even as an p2w player is not enough unless you are willing to spend over 200$! Trust me im an p2w and have spent on gold until i realized that its a waste to spend on gold and only buy skins
---
Ok
---
yeah it's annoying
---
Fatcs
---
Lol but to be clear this is fake but i understand the joke
---
I would give 5 rounds and every round you have to play another brawler and both players have to use same brawlers every round
---
Better idea for star power would be when he use his super he gains 30% damage reduction shield for 6 seconds
---

same here

Doesn‚Äôt that mean the boss can‚Äôt get out until a brawler goes to attack?

isn't every box looks a bit rectangular?

Its a running joke on this sub. It may be getting a bit overused, yes, but no need to get so mad over it. Your emojis aren't helping your point, either.

The bad One Is Mortis in Heist, the bad randoms play Mortis in Heist and not Mortis in bounty BECAUSE THEY ARE BAD
---
Humor tag
---
Please draw male Piper
---
How the hell are you at 7.3k trophies and still unable to dodge even a few Piper shots? Playing and dodging Piper is both very strategic and you're saying this as if she's guaranteed to hit you. It takes skill to play Piper, and now that you're nearing the 10k zone people are going to start to play Piper better than they did when you were at lower trophies.
---
I know it was just luck, i just liked the video because i enjoyed it

this could be a gamemode :D

This is so true.

Ohhh I didnt know that syrup exists
---
9/10. So true
---
It‚Äôs already permanent for the new players
---
exactly, i said that 1000 gold seems a lot to lower hq people and not so much for pro players. Im hq 5 and I have over 6k gold
---
Dr Phil: Humanity was a mistake, lets get real here
---
I had 15k before I got a leg and my chance was 0.26 so don‚Äôt complain
---
Looks awesome!
---
Yeah, he has a problem
---
Why would he need a damage buff? He has a very long and wide cone for his attack, that‚Äôs why his damage is balanced the way it is. It is effortless to hit anyway with an attack.
---
If you want a damage buff expect a big nerf to his wide cone.
---
brawl talk will be next week or a week before halloween

Maybe ppl over 15k should get free coins and gems and maybe power pts if they dont have everyone maxed out, at the end of the seasons
---
Bo is overall a good character in Bounty. In 99% of all plays you will have a Bull, Primo or a Rosa on your Team. Stay close to them and helo them when you face Shelly or something.
---
Well, chances for getting star power are 10 times higher than legendary though

Glad Minecraft is revived.

Unless they are a rank 35 Mortis this is true because in order to play Mortis in brawl ball now you have to be 9000 Iq
---
And if i remember corrctly it ended up being brawl talk
---
Nice idea
---
Have you not played the other games..?
---
MARF
---
Spectacular work dude!
---
Shut up and take my gems. Dope idea
---
Post this to Mortis gang
---
Song?
---
Your a legend!
---
Also pam is called a dude
---
creepy
---
Thanks :)
---
Look up "gyro jet". 
---
IMO, Supercell opted to betray the original Piper gun concept of a self-propelled bullets. These type really do follow the rule that farther targets get hit harder. For self-propelled types, max range was worse for the target. But, the bullet trijectory was never perfect. .... but then, Piper is a rich aeristocrat and seems to have gotten a gun that can fire perfect gyro jets.

Somebody‚Äôs salty 0.0

Think your just bad not the piper's.
---
Dude, what you just did could have been done with literally any other brawler.
---
Git gud
---
Why is it so underrated lol
---
Forgive me
---
No, chief. That ain't it.

Yeah me too, can someone translate?

It's no the brawl talk, sorry
---
no :(
---
Can everyone just agree that auto-aiming is fine in CERTAIN situations? Obviously manual helps when there are multiple targets (or when you want to obliterate (or not) some walls instead of attacking someone). If you‚Äôre up and close with your target, it‚Äôs a safer bet to auto-aim, plus it‚Äôs quicker especially if someone surprises you. It takes more skill to use auto-aim all the time but with Shelly, both are definitely a part of her gameplay makeup. It might be detrimental to use either exclusively‚Ä¶

i meant the "take your low efford comment and shove it up you ass",that was unexpected,but i get what you are saying
---
Same, but I'm good at drawing for my age
---
No dont buy because of the halloween update we might get better skins
---
He wasn‚Äôt even shooting at me ;)
---
Oh? You're approaching me? Although I killed your friend you are approaching me? 
---
I can't beat the crap out of you without getting closer.
---
Oh! Then come as close as you like!
---
Oh I forgot about that. Thnx but better skins.....Loaded Rico is a good skin
---
It‚Äôs oh ho! not oh! get your facts right
---
Sure lol
---
I had 4K coins and star powers weren‚Äôt showing up in my shop for the past several days. Used all of my coins to upgrade brawlers cuz I got tired of waiting and the next day, there are 3 star powers in my shop. Bruh
---
Neat idea!
---
Two questions tho: 1) how much damage would his super do per second? and 2) what are those symbols about? (the ones with the x‚Äôs and o‚Äôs)
---
Duuuuuude
---
Oh sorry... I literally today finished the last episode but was bleeding from my noise when they fought... It's hot AF here

---
Hey not sweat man, literally...
---
Record tutorial and send me
---
For sure, I have five brawlers I could upgrade to power 10 but have no gold, and have never spent gold on star powers.  Maybe the star point system could be buffed for late game players to get more gold.
---
Can u please add prestige to brawlers ranks. It would be appreciated. Thanks.
---
Hmm sounds good.
---
It‚Äôs from the new Halloween video
---
This should honestly be in game
---
Thank you!Every answer is good!
---
I didn‚Äôt enjoy golden wind as mutch as the other ones
---
My expectations where really high, but you somehow managed to bypass them completely!
---
Will be looking for all those amazing art posts these days for sure!
---
Technically you do, since you looked at this post and made an effort commenting on it
---
Ahahaha nice editing skills üëç
---
This video is cool, but you missed the oppertunity to call it *Brawloween*
---
I agree that this becomes a problem sometimes, but there times where this becomes an advantage. Such as baiting and getting the other team to push too much.
---
They bout together fuuuuuuucked up
---
Have you got the sound on?
---
It takes a few hours to finish.
---
Tbh, i've made this in kinemaster, bc i dont have a pc
---
Repost you don‚Äôt know how to be creative
---
Well sure it is reasonable to team up with someone if you have a bad matchup with another brawler or they have high power cubes. Also why would they attack each other that would just make them both weaker.
---
Lol F for leon. He tried so hard
---
I expected Dio or Rickroll
---
I was really wrong.
---
Hmm...I can't read russian
---
He made ALL combinations with 2 brawlers
---
He posts his own achievements in Reddit, you don‚Äôt need to try and freeload karma
---
I already see those arts, kinda suspect...
---
Spike
---
I have already earned 100 gems for the skins uwu
---
Nobody is saying replace the other star powers. People just like suggesting 3rd star powers. I bet in a bit over a year they might consider adding 3rd star powers.
---
It‚Äôs the hidden video ‚Ä¶ I can prove it ‚Ä¶ coach Cory still have the link of the video ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs about you-tuber tournament ‚Ä¶ that video only work if you have the link to that ‚Ä¶

Why are you all booing me I'm right

Because you're not a beta player, ah yes, eslaved global player

Now i get it

True tho

I thought I deleted this post

But sometimes you don't  have time to wait if you're addicted I use to go offline and cool down with my family but now I have no one just my fat cat

What did he say?
---
Your opinion is no longer valid
---
This probably took you long time,right ?? The bot is so annoying he always ask you the same question
---
WOAH THIS OUTRAGEOUS!!! I LOVE THIS... I HAVE NO WORDS.... THIS IS SIMPLY OUTSTANDING... NOT EVEN SUPERCELL COULD BEAT THIS...

If they do require no skill, then you can get them to the top easily.

After all these years, I found it!

Dodging the power cube in showdown

He must have been lagging or something. Happens to me all the time lol
---
What about Poco,Shelly and Colt?
---
Get righ there?
---
This sounds like a good game mode, and there are definitely going to be good and bad brawlers, so I really like it!
---
Aren't you a party pooper, well be it or not, we're hoping brawl talk comes soon
---
OH MY GOD JEDI I DUCKING DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY ARE YOU STILL NOT A SUPERCELL DEVELOPER?!?!

Shut up I didn‚Äôt get my first one until 13.5k so suck a dick little kid
---
Be my wife ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
No. Skins are useless.
---
Shitposting
---
Buffing crow is the worst idea I have ever heard, he is literally already on the tip of being op. Piper is a sniper, she doesn't deserve a range decrease, but I do agree with you on the damage part.
---
The one with the hat(wich is not there) :(
---
Furry- a person who likes to draw furry animals
---
Neko- A person that draw ppl with cat ears
---
Know the difference smh

Piper is not unbalanced. She was low tier in all 3x3 gamemodes except bounty before her 2nd SP was released
---
frakts
---
How did you get this??
---
The "take over fortnite" part is funny. That will never happen.
---
r/comedycemetery
---
probably, but it happened to me many times that I was paired with people of less than 300 trophies when i was in a team with a friend or with randoms and the 200 one leave while i continued playing with the one who is in my trophies, matchmaking isn't right, they have to fix it
---
Nice I‚Äôm at 14.5k trying to get 15k, keep grinding and you‚Äôll get higher
---
Ooh it's poco I acualy thout it was mortis. Lets just say it's a good skin for them both.
---
I think it would be cool if it shot pumpkins and the mines were seeds.
---
Same!

Here is the link to the map!  [https://crux.page.link/4xteF](https://crux.page.link/4xteF)

If you like this map and want it in the game, please give it a thumbs up!

speaking of tick holding a pumpkin they should make a pumpkin tick skin

LOLOLOLO 69696969 XD RAWR IS VERY FUNNY CAUS SECS HAHAHAH!!!!!!!

Nobody wants these posts stop
---
That‚Äôs only 11k though

Sorry for your loss, I saw that you even caught the ball the first time the noob tried to score.
---
Ah, alright. Didn‚Äôt think about that. My cart is fast, meaning that it‚Äôs excellent for transporting the crows. But would you like to borrow my friend‚Äôs hammer? He‚Äôs name‚Äôs Hog Rider Carl, you‚Äôll find him in a Gem Grab map called ¬´Minecart Madness¬ª, driving around in his old, scrappy minecart!
---
Kinda useless
---
Repost this was a concept a few months ago
---
ƒ∞t's old brawl talk
---
The enemy Pam really backstabbed you guys by taking away 5% lol
---
Only if you give me those star power deals in your shop ;)
---
Rule 5: low effort posts
---
And she could shoot water. I love the splash effect of the beach series
---
I found it in this post: 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/9sy3nb/psa_posted_by_brawl_stars_on_their_official/
---
If you think that's op, try bull with snappy sniping
---
Also star powers usually only increase damage by numbers, not percents because it would make them op in showdown and takedown where their damage can be increased so maybe change it so it increases damage by 80 damage per laser and reduce the hp requirement to 40% because 60% sounds too east to get to
---
Damn
---
So without the vision you‚Äôre not this worth it
---
Yo, you're a legend. Thanks.
---
i just want them to fix the lag (and clubs)
---
?? Tell me, does it take more time to get 1k in cr than in bs? No! In cr u usually have 50-100k gold, in bs never, and in coc u have 10 mil
---
Leon is whyt now

Thanks, and that is fine with me.

That blacklist idea sounds very cool actually

Epic adds ‚Äúcool‚Äù shit without considering balance, which means that quite frequently the games balance is just fucking shattered when a new content update or season drops. 
---
Also bloom. Fuck bloom. Bloom while ADS‚Äôing has no place being in any shooter and it CERTAINLY has no place in a battle royale. It‚Äôs a shit mechanic designed to lower the skill gap between players that rewards players with mediocre aim while punishing players with good aim.
---
We all are free to imagine whatever we want to :)
---
If i had to compare it, her main attack is a mix of Carl's, Barley's, Nita's, and Brock's main attacks and Bibi's super but at 8-bit speed

That look so amazing

They can't shoot great...)

Oh God, these kids can't respect anyone, they always think they're gonna be cool if they disrespect someone's sexuality or color

Ambush is extremely annoying, couple that with poco and you got a 99% win rate team, what the hell add a leon and make it 100%

you can now buy worc or maybe ekips

Also me = couz you‚Äôre my 2nd favourite brawler

I‚Äôm surprised you even found my old post. I agree with basically everything you said. Bad players and teamers just honestly ruined the game for me

Because Halloween is near

Next day you have BAN

Aw man... I was hoping for what the top guy was hoping üò•

the meme was *this* close to being perfect

Duh you need to be in the top 5 posts on the front page  and have at least 1k upvotes to be on Meme Review
---
congrats i guess?!
---
But you spout that shit out your humongous mouth 
---
I'm the idiot? That's why I jumped in a conversation
---
If you didn‚Äôt knew brawl stars make your rounds laggy on purpose just like clash royale , haven‚Äôt you noticed that when you are about to kill an enemy,an  enemy comes close to you or you have 10 gems your game freezes?
---
Not my problem.
---
It‚Äôs decent.
---
nope, it isnt.

Thanks, I guess?

PS: Person gave me no stats about things like increased win rates or play rates
---
Now this is truly a low effort post, and the meme's not even that good. You didn't even put any effort in this post. You just took a picture online with a title, hoping for free karma.
