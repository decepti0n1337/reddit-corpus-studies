Kinda sad how you pay attention so much on memes instead of actually focusing on the conversation here. All I said was that op's technically wrong and you came out of nowhere and said get your head our of your ass which still makes no sense to me. Probably another stupid, pathetic meme you use

It‚Äôs not stonks at all because the token doubler you get from boxes/purchased using gems doubles tokens AFTER tokens you get and the double token weekend. You don‚Äôt benefit anything token doubler wise; the only thing is probably just saving you time to finish your token doubler.
---
Thanks
---
Everyone knows about this.
---
The higher trophies you have, the lesser trophies you will be rewarded/win, and the more trophies you‚Äôll lose/loss.
---
that's rickdiculus
---
You absolutely can‚Äôt. There‚Äôs a delay between the actual game and what spectators see. We tried this to find out. I played solo and had a club mate spectate and voice chat. Everything he told me, I already knew. The only exception was where a bush camper was but I woulda figured that out because I‚Äôm not stupid and I bush camp.

oh no im so frightened that im in a fight with a fuckin‚Äô toddler. bruh this guy just wanted to show you something and you‚Äôre over here saying ‚Äúwaaa he no specify, so he wrong waaa‚Äù like dude cant you just enjoy something. the point of getting your head out of your ass is to look at something at face value, and just appreciate it for what it is. hope you learned something, peace bitches.

Plot twist : There are &gt;1 brawlers in the map
---
I think that 600 would be a good replacement!!
---
To much reddit for today
---
This is disturbing
---
I have crow but i want spike or leon. Why is it like that?¬ø?
---
Crow is like 8 in crow years
---
I play Mortis in heist on maps where throwers/shooters are good.
---
You would hear bonetrousle instead.
---
r/emojipatrol
---
Very cool
---
Reeee
---
Oh no, I'm a bad random!
---
He can tell you almost everything.. where the energy drink is spawning..where the robot is spawning... and most importantly tell you where the remaining players are , what brawler do they have , how many power cubes they have ...this is most helpful with maps full of bushes like cavern churn and eye of the storm and even in the gem grab map : snake pariel (not sure what the second word was)
---
Wow
---

---
you are a terrible player.
---
I wanna be Winston
---
Why did you get downvoted twice?
---
You‚Äôre welcome!
---
yes , im 25 lvl supercell, but i have 96 lvl

Your lucky you have bibi im at 4k trophies and still no epics :,&lt;

I‚Äôve gotten the full 128 without token doubler but never 196 with it
---
Did you expect to get a legendary with that low of a chance?
---
huh? why is there a fly? (around end where in shows sandy)
---
Nice
---
300 gems is when the model changes todinho so I think this skin could be 150 gems or 80
---
found it (somewhere in the shadows!)
---
I don‚Äôt even know
---
There's always a chance
---
*cries*
---
ok bonne chance ü§û
---
piper really out here with the name skinny legend and I respect that
---
Inspired of gol d roger?
---
Don't you mean jotaro kujo? Sorry if I'm missing a joke lol
---
His name is noob. What‚Äôd you expect?
---
this thread is spooky because the flairs are all mortis
---
50% players know how to pass the ball
---
10/10 would buy
---
close combat chars in (most) bounty maps are also awful. most of the time they can't even get close to the other team which consists of Piper/Brock/Penny
---
God help us
---
[removed]
---
Omg pls nerf Nita her bear always keeps scratching in a weird position omg!! Nerf Nita I can‚Äôt even get past 200 trophies!!
---
You played yourself
---
Ok
---
this is not a background enough to be a wallpaper
---
Gene has more health and better burst damage
---
Leon: Gentelmen, I see the lollipops safe
---
Brock: Safe and sou-
---
*Stuffs mouth full of lollipops*
---
*Begins to choke and dies*
---
Brock: -nd
---
I think it‚Äôs because you were 1 power point off the maximum to get the brawler to level 9
---
So I was at rank fifteen, then my trophy count went down under 300, which is the amount required to get to rank fifteen.
---
I'm basically saying that I'm so bad that I shouldn't even be at the rank I am.
---
Piper: is godly in overtime
---
Mortis: Counters throwers which are common in heist
---
Frank: ok frank does suck here

This guy probably has a pikachu already smh don‚Äôt be too upset
---
Well it can happen bc good content gets stolen a lot.
---
Yeah the full was the option, but they only have one orange and no white so I decided to just go with outlines. Spinning seems like a cool idea, but I'll figure out animations later probably. Thanks anyways
---
Yup. That‚Äôs just how it is. This was fairly low effort so I wouldn‚Äôt care too much if this gets stolen. I‚Äôll be mad, but not that mad. I‚Äôd suggest putting a watermark on your vids.
---
Dude yer art is too amazing
---
Yup. Anyways goodnight

It's what happens when you join two chests in minecraft
---
noice.
---
Yep, 640 from max Robo and level up doubled.
---
So whelly got TWO mega boxes?
---
He got 10 trophies so it's obv a showdown win.
---
How many draws would this give, 20 or 25?
---
I feel this. After I posted this I got Carl out of a box.
---
Have you seen yde play mortis in heist
---
lol I finally know what is 1-byte
---
Dumbass
---
 I don't understand you, I'm not an English speaker
---
Mortis in snake prarie
---
Imagine waiting 2 months to insult someone.
---
sadly this is one of the most relatable things I've seen here
---
What app did you use to draw this? It's just too cool
---
Exactly. Mortis is basically garbage without starpowers, like Darryl used to be.
---
No, that was the old star points system. When they added the new ranks, they reworked it.
---
Imagine not know what I mean by tryhard
---
Frank in Lone Star actually helps you :D. Frank in Bounty would make a lot more sense imo
---
Are you saying Mortis is bad
---
So its like an artist‚Äôs signature?

This is a shit post please delete it r/shittybrawlstars

Yeah, this makes me really miss both Ricochet and the lore of descriptions at the same time, aside from the good skin concept and art lol

Amazing concept I hope the devs add this!
---
Do robo rumble with 20 tickets and try to stay alive until 6:15 and then u will get like 2k tokens
---
Lol this happened to me too last week, i got mortis and tara after 3 months no new brawlers
---
Ah, sorryforactinglikeajackassbye
---
Ok bye
---
rockwell brawl
---
Exactly! I‚Äôd rather the token doublers be applied before the event doubler... It‚Äôs quite annoying.

Dang, but they told me it would be the same thing

It does üòÇ

Did not commit luagh

Well the review in the pic only said black people and jewish people so thats what i put

11000 but theres a twist i have no legendary

you are my legendary

Just no

Wow! *Surprised Pikachu face*

but it's got Brawl stars related stuff in it

I did not do it on purpose, reddit went crazy.
---
500iq gameplay
---
Actually reddit was the one that posted it 6 times. Idk how. They were all posted at the very same moment.
---
he never begged for downvotes
---
Reddit posted it 6 times for some reason.
---
1st.Not begging for upvotes,i suggest re-reading the title of the post.The title simply requests everyone to show some love,if you are betting one ticket as the big brawler,you can simply suicide to benefit 5 others.2nd,if i was begging for upvotes,wouldn‚Äôt the title be much different?Like ‚Äòupvote to continue this deed‚Äô or something.I dont see anywhere in the title where i asked for upvotes,just simply try to continue the good deed.3rd.Hopefully you need to consider how long i took to matchmake for this game,and how long it took me to get the big brawler.No offense but,next time,just try to re-read the title yeah.
---
Wow im over the moon
---
that 1k looks nice. and does matchmaking take time ? (even though its only big brawler)
---
Begs for downvotes??
---
I only posted it once but for some reason it got posted 6 times...
---
This guy is farming Karma so good!

you replied to the wrong guy
---
extremely
---
Nice map! Def would play on.
---
I actually want this, hope to get this next CoC anniversary.
---
When there are dynamikes
---
How did you get to Mod the game??
---
It was impossible for me since month!
---
Thank you,and yes took about 3 mins to matchmake,and about 3 games to get big brawler.Hopefully you‚Äôll understand,i dont want upvotes,but if you are betting one ticket,simply i ask you to continue the good deed üòä
---
cool and all but have you imagined how the public would react to a game with p2w casino lootbox system that this game has going to a console?
---
Just say that the game fullfills matches with bot with fake names üëãüèª
---
Happy cake day
---
oh crap, he went GOD MODE
---
yes yes i understand , i was not the one who accused you of begging for upvotes. the other guy did
---
What do you Want to nerf about it its allready nerfed so hard
---
Z e r o p o w e r t I c k d o t e x e
---
lol, meant to say upvotes
---
Playing bs in a switch is actually possible (maybe not anymore) but you need a computer
---
Probably how they reacted to the other mobile games that came to switch
---
Yeah,i‚Äôve replied to his comment haha,sorry for the confusion
---
There should be a button for the options menu, like + or -, and a button to visualize the map of the current event like x or y

You dont pull that phrase out of your ass for nothing, you pull it out with the indirect intention to imply you want upvotes. 
---
This phrase is often used at the beginning/end of a performance/show, which is soon followed by applause. You using this phrase here implies you want 'applause' - the Reddit equivalent of which are upvotes.
---
Insteading of me needing to reread titles, **you** need to rethink your phrasing. I know you dont care about my downvote anyway, but I'm doing it for moral reasons. Have a good day.

Removing his eyes? Sure. Him being a hentai MC? Not so much. Last thing you'd hear is Bibi moaning. **oh god what did i just type**

Yes this happened to me with gene. I got him and so long could not get one power point from box. I was also wondering why it happens. Now I know it's not only me

Really help you?

But it is enough?

If not keep your mouth shut!

YAAAAY  A 150 COINS FOR MY HARD WORK!!!!  (what everyone is saying is, that if we do get coins, we should get more, not 300 but maybe 600 or even more)

At least you have a good point, the one above was salty about my opinion.

my pb is 16.2k and i have like 16 brawlers with max pp but not enough coins to upgrade. those coins are not enough, you will realise that later as you get closer to maxing your account

Thanks i'll never stop
---
I'd kill for a Crow. Second favourite with Mortis being 1st
---
It is their problem, 1) they allowed to change his super, 2) they allowed for El Primo to build and close the goal 3)  they are loosening 1 goal. 4) and they don't have wall breakers. I think they done a lot af mistakes (it will be OP for stupid people)
---
You are trash
---
It's disapper!! What about XUAN6WSE??
---
THE ONLY SOUND I CAN HEAR LOOKING AT THIS IS ULTRA REVERB NOOT NOOT
---
12k and never ever had a brawler or starpower or 30+ gems coming out of a megabox. I think it is all set up to prank me.
---
Buy it. You get a legendary for a cost of mythic brawler
---
27 tokens per ticket 
---
play robo rumble with good teammatesalways get the startoken because it is worth 30 tokens
---
Picture died so
---
 imma ges li-on's in d-ere
---
And pick him
---
oh cool
---
I got Crow before 2k. Now im 11k with everyone but 3 legendary
---
Good idea, love that game
---
You could just take the joycons off and play with the touch screen so you don‚Äôt have to use the controls
---
Yeah they're two of my favourite brawlers too. Might not be the strongest brawlers right now but they're always so much fun to play with. My favourite though is Spike, and I still don't have him :'(
---
Niceee it would be cool to make it like mortis sister or something
---
The clickbait is everywhere. Sadly
---
Yep. Nobody thinks you're cool for doing that.
---
we want more jews

I was going to say that!

---
T R A C E R
---
skin inlcudes ( a little idea of mine)
---
-custom brawler model
---
-custom effects (pickaxe boomerang become Saturn ring and the super get colorful and full of stars like a galaxy and the ufos parts Light Up in many colors) 
---
-custom sounds (super sound become a cosmic sound) 
---
-custom voice (carls voice has a digital like voice idk how to describe) 
---
-custom animations (walking animation couse the ufo floats and moves and spins best skin for teamers :) )
---
Nah, I'd argue 650 and above got mostly decent players. Issue is, it's an absurd grind to get there every season even on a couple of chars so unless you've got the time to burn you're stuck with people like in the vid.
---
or shelly in low trophies lol

No ur dumb .Shelly was in the team with them and it‚Äôs their choice

You can look at my account (justArfy) and make sure that I played for sure more than a month.  it may seem to me, but I'm one of the few people who were not at all angry at the game.  I believe that the game sucks because 1. the majority of the community of the game consists only of idiots who will judge you only by skill, and 2. the developer (who basically does not hire new employees) updates the game every 3 years (!)

sorry for the mistakes, translated through a translator.

I don't think it'll be good since other players will kill the leading damage dealer. Maybe it's best to not show the stats.

.....I'm scared

I mean yeah, after 500 trophies, trophies reset every season. Like I've been playing for a year or so and have pushed 20k. But most of my brawlers right now are like low 500 because I don't play then as much. You can always go to your battle log and view the players profile to see if he is a dedicated player or just a Nita main.

I got my first legendary at 15k(playing since global)

Unfortunately it's not dumb but pretty smart. They know millions of dumbass kids will click and see their favorite tuber unlock many legendaries.

So this is a collection of brawl ball goal that look fantastic. But one important question. Is KairoTime correct in saying that for MOST situations, Mortis is subpar in brawl ball unless he is piloted by someone like yourself, who has a ton of time played with him?
---
no it doesnt
---
That's not how you use woosh lmao

Yeah, Colt is distracting

Yeah but I‚Äôm saying he was meant to be an assassin in game. You can play him as a support but he‚Äôs meant to be an assassin but isn‚Äôt even that great of an assassin compared to Leon or others

You heard of slacktivism?

Yeah, you're right. But not everyone is that stupid to think that this is True

What!? Oh hell nawwww!

Not even brawl stars related, how the fuck did this get upvotes?
---
Lol I posted that before
---
what about fist of fury
---
Because crow does show it's tail
---
Oh, okay, let it be 150 then
---
***Noice***
---
He doesent know what IS brawl stars he just hear a≈• school
---
Nice map
---
Yeah if you try this in the training cave, if you auto-aim on the Robot, the other robots will take damage not the one you auto aim
---
I don‚Äôt see anyth... you thought i was gonna say the joke üòÇ
---
This happens exactly.
---
Everyone: cool concept
---
Me: hE Is DOiNG T POsE
---
Sad thing is, it IS a strategy
---
Sorry
---
Gene is from Cato right?
---
Come back and talk when you learn English.
---
Congrats! Welcome the hell
---
I think its just weird dreaming about cartoon character in that way.
---
I actually figured out why this happens
---
and its not simple
---
Well if you didn‚Äôt know you don‚Äôt get trophies when you crash out of the game
---
just that
---
auto corrector HATER
---
Yup it was in August unfortunately (that why I made my reddit account in the first place)
---
it's a screenshot where the old crow model is seen
---
See you in hto
---
I got 800 throphies with Frank:)
---
Gun snek in Brawl stars would be fun tho ngl
---
Actually I've thought of a way. You have to let go of the joystick first and then let go of the trigger to not shoot it. Whereas to shoot you let go of the trigger while aiming
---
Removed.
---
Rule 4. Keep post titles descriptive. Do not use all caps/clickbait/low effort titles.
---
It's like I'm watching some old school movie
---
See you in hot
---
By the way your template is good
---
Alright here buddy, I‚Äôm at 4000 trophies and have no legendaries. This post triggers me
---
This is brawl star not clash Royale
---
One post of this is enough, stop spamming. Removed.
---
Brawl pewds
---
Supercell plzzzzzzz
---
Rule 5. Repetitive or low effort posts with a low discussion potential will be removed.

---
If you want sandy you need to wait a long time i think.
---
But 8f you are p2w i schould by it
---
As An f2p i agree i also play clash royale And still have only one deck (golem, night witch beatdown) 
---
With all the cards lvl 10 or higher (max lvl 12 zap)
---
brawl talk
---
If it is it ain't very popular. It's quite easy to notice popular memes and trends
---
Nice video, but I can't help but feel that many of the shots were over-done for the sake of being cool. In most cases, even a normal shot would have sufficed; no need to bounce off three walls.
---
Yeah I just put the profiles of dynamite, Poco and an edited Poco instead
---
Actually it‚Äôs you who started teaming with him
---
This nerd more upvotes
---
The WR is 14s and my record is 16s
---
OMG, GEDI-KOR, I love your work tysm, and keep it up!
---
only 4000 ? nyeeeh
---
True dat but have an updoooot
---
Good one üòâ
---
I knew it but it's a bug, right?
---
I could be wrong but I‚Äôm pretty sure lead is 1st, doing good is 2nd to 3rd, doing ok is 4th to either 5th or 6th and the rest is need more stars
---
It was already Fighter

Hey how many subs you got

Shut off your assbutt motherbitcher

Darryl doesn‚Äôt need a remodel tho and he has a skin
---
Buying legie will downshift my drop rate???
---
Welcome to sandy gang
---
Bug/glitch are similar enough. Both result in unintentional consequences.
---
[deleted]
---
Attack names for Rosa, 8-Bit, and Sandy aren‚Äôt in caps.
---
They aren‚Äôt creatures of the nught
---
Thanks, bro
---
No u havent, this was addressed a month ago
---
Auto aim is a feature, not bug abuse. Get off your high horse and learn to use it when it's helpful
---
Sandy gang :3
---
It took me 8 months to get the total number of gems up there, so if you get a deal earlier, you can probably do it in 5-6 months to get 349 gems
---
No brawler is worth spending money on IMO, and spike is probably the last one I would have wanted to spend money on if I ever did. He‚Äôs great in brawl ball and some gem grab maps but he‚Äôs far from spectacular. Leon would be a much better option
---
Not bug you are just unlucky
---
Of course not, buying brawlers on the shop doesn't affect your drop rates
---
Try again all of us know who he is you can,t just steal it and it will work
---
Removed - Your post is too short, please expand on your title.
---
If you are in a box, and you shoot daggers out of the box, will the box get hit by them? No, that's exactly what happened.
---
yet the entire community whines when someone teams in camera.
---
OMFG
---
To get you to spend money. Do you think those servers pay for themselves?
---
Oh ok can u tell me when, so that I try to do it every match
---
stick
---
I understand how the game processes, and what you are describing. But Crow is not in a box, that is just the mechanism that the game uses to calculate the result of the actions. Whether this was an oversight is based on SC's intention. I wouldn't be surprised if they wanted it to be this way, and I wouldn't be surprised if they didn't. But no one is arguing against what you just said.
---
not gonna happen. sales from the lootbox casino would drop low if such system would be implemented. and for a poor indie company like supercell they need that money.
---
by the way, brawlstars is the most f2p out of all games. stop crying for free stuff and ask mommy her credit card if you want to play Leon.
---
Yep
---
A feature that was implemented so new players could have an easier time learning the controls. You know what else was a feature? Tap to shoot, and now it‚Äôs not. Crazy how that can happen! Now get off YOUR high horse, sweetie. Bless your heart!
---
#hmmmmm
---
Hey guys why did he just post a blank picture?
---
Laugh
---
Laugh now you have to laugh
---
Yeah it doesn‚Äôt I checked and I was wrong sorry
---
Because money
---
Yeah. Best value in the game
---
Token doublers are 29 for 1000 or 39 for 1400 if you buy the offer. Token doublers are ALWAYS more efficient than buying a megabox. The difference is that buying a megabox instantly rewards you, while tokendoubler rewards you overtime(but has waaay better value).
---
In other words, do not ever buy megaboxes. Do not buy 1k token doublers for 50 gems unless you are impatient. Preferably always get the 29 and 39 gem offers.
---
Unless you are filthy rich and have money to spend/don't care about efficiency.
---
This idea has been suggested so many times. I don't understand why people keep upvoting it. [Frank has spoken.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/b7guep/frank_and_darryl_skins_icons/ejtbimx/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)
---
Yes! I‚Äôve had power level 8 Leon for far too long (about 2 months... still not even 120 power points yet) and I‚Äôve been itching to get him to 9... he will be my first level 10
---
*ocd activated*
---
oh ho WOW,this is some great art bro
---
Well that just sound like  coild snake with extra steps
---
OP didnt do them
---
Yes, this would be awesome! And would limit the amount of toxic dynamike teaming
---
Ways to respec your brawlers you leveled up a lot so you can switch those power points and coins to a different brawler to level up
---
Edit: Or a ‚Äúpreferred power points‚Äù setting, so that you could turn off power points gain for up to 5 brawlers, raising your chances of leveling up brawlers you want to level up
---
No you got 3rd
---
In game name checks out
---
Ik

Ya know energy drink is like chocolate. Its really tasty but if its near a hush (cuz chocolate does that( ya dead
---
Well at least you can say that you took this from lwarb beta
---
Uh bring that damage down lol that‚Äôs stupid unless this is at level 10... well no actually definitely not
---
Lol..waste super
---
A small thing. There are many things but I would like to see a rework on Bibi's Super. Her Super us fine but I would like it to be different. I would make more sense from realistic point and gameplay point. Her Super should deal only around 400-500 DMG. For that it should slowdown enemies for 3 seconds. This makes more sense because it's chewing gum. Less DMG makes more sense. It also helps Bibi in combat. You know the moments when you wnat to kill somebody but you just knockback them away? With this rework Bibi would knockback enemies slow, then slow them wirh her Super so you can catch up better. This just makes sense. Bibi actually has a Star Power in the gamefiles that gives her Super the slow effect (even with the DMG) but we don't know when this SP comes if it comes at all
---
4 minutes 7 seconds with Rosa
---
Yeah it sucks
---
Yeah man, Ricochet was better
---
Happens to me too
---
I hope you get there soon
---
[Another one](https://imgur.com/a/zflfU7p)
---
I don't see a lot of teaming lately as i used to some months ago, i'm just lucky or something changed?
---
I beat an 8 cube Leon as a 1 cube Mortis with an energy drink.
---
No, u got.
---
I am free to speak any

---
Oh yeah that was when Rosa‚Äôs so OP lol. But what about after Rosa got nerfed?
---
Mine is .19
---
Lol.. true
---
This template also works as a meme, spike wants to show bull nuts!
---
Lol what if it's my post
---
#NO
---
I know bro but she's not like 8-bit/tick/sandy.....
---
The only thing that was nice about bibi was her movement speed and the nerfed it :/
---
What year is this that this template is still relevant 2012??
---
Lucky ass
---
What is this map?
---
Frick you
---
Cyberpunk 2077 is overrated. Change my mind.
---
I dont remember prob around 2 minutes
---
I know, I was being kinda lazy
---
Wait..... Yes exactly because.. Uhh there's night in minecraft and mortis is a creature of the night (I knew I would find a way to explain it)
---
There‚Äôs an invisible wall near the water
---
All 4 legendaries are great though. The fact that Leon is the weakest legendary is crazy
---
This haunts my dreams
---
Thanks for the tip
---
Prove it.
---
#MINECRAFT
---
the SunBentley is just sad. He got 1400 and went back down to 875
---
*Cries in Mortis*
---
Ayy, your saving boxes! Your bound to get a new brawler with that
---
Yee
---
Agreed...but only IF played correctly.
---
3v3 gamemode
---
Maximum time: 3 minutes
---
Collect power cubes from boxes (the boxes in this gamemode have 4000 health instead of 6000) to become stronger (collecting one doesnt increase stats of your other two teammates) (you can have a maximum of 10 cubes in this gamemode)
---
The more power cubes you've collected, the more points your opponents get for killing you. (They get 1 point if you have either 0 or 1 power cubes)
---
There is a point in the middle where every 15 seconds a star spawns that increases your team's score by 1 when someone from your team collects it
---
The game ends either at max time (3 minutes) or when one team gets 80 points
---
Respawn speed is the same as Bounty
---
Boxes respawn in the positions they were destroyed 20 seconds after they are destroyed
---
It‚Äôs fine, but I agree with you, the draw music is way better than the other music.
---
Mortis teams as much as dynamike, no one ever said mortis opposes teaming
---
How did you create that?
---
Nice meme format

For anyone wondering, here's the original Cyanide and Happiness comic:
