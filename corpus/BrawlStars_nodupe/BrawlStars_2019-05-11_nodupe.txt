How will Rico eat the spaghetti
---
You do realize that the rewards only reset in cr for the leagues, like when you reach Chalenger I, which is hard to get to, the rewards don’t reset for normal players every season, that would be OP since you’d get a free legendary in CR every season, I agree that seasons should reset in BS but this comparison is invalid
---
Spike kills the teamers
---
I posted it and will start on Rico then Tara
---
*Ready for another?*
---
This is really underrated amazing work m8
---
1. Shelly is most likely italian
---
2. Piper has a southern accent
---

---
I rest my case
---
uwu yes
---
In the game :p (jk)
---
I was out of time to draw this, this is why some Brawlers are missing.
---
Rico and piper reference nice
---
This.is.amazing. New homescreen for sure!!
---
My friend has 1000 trophies and all epics and mythic. While I'm at 4.5k and have one epic one mythic
---
Carl's probably digging as usual, darryl is contemplating his rework
---
That must be his second main, the first one is bull
---
Heh, thank you 😊
---
Thanks for my new wallpaper for my phone
---
WE WILL NEVER RESIDE
---
It's ok lol. I got that reference... 😅
---
Lol. Thanks noob
---
I actually have more luck playing on my regular T-Mobil connection, than my WiFi.  But keep shilling out your narrative
---
FBI open up!!!!!!!!
---
1. Piper has a southern accent
---
Where’s all the other brawlers?
---
now do the same with art oh wait you have no integrity
---
Always thought frank was a dj
---
This reminds me of a Meme:
---
Spectator: We have all the gems | Penny: Run! | Pam: Hide! | Primo: My super is ready and I had 12 gems... | Spectator: DONT YOU DARE | Primo: EEEEEEELLLLLLLL PRIIIIII!!11IIIMOOO()00!! *uses super*
---
THIS IS EXTREMELY CONTROVERSIAL
---
I want to make a toast: Garlic Bread. Also this is awesome artwork. Thank you!
---
So this is what happens when I turn off the game!🤣
---
You brought to life what many merely imagined!
---
Really awesome
---
Thanks! Well, a tavern is in fact a place that serves alcohol and bad food, but who said Barley should follow those standards? 😅
---
Dank.
---
Yeah it’s kinda ridiculous.

Its really good:O continue to draw

yes, I did inspired him because I am Brazilian all the children here love this drawing
---
I also hope so •,u•)

Lol it looks nice tho

yeah, that was fun

I dont think they were teaming, i think you were just being sandwiched.

Huh? Im at 12k

ohhhhhhhhh

Welp You tried,Now you've been downvoted to oblivion
---
This is the 6969 meme but better
---
You mean notes

Or brawl Stars?
---
I just wrote everything down on notes and pasted it into here
---
😂😂😂👌
---
There is no credits anywhere so by posting this you are claiming it as your own
---
Leon is California
---
Her super should block 50% dammage. Not 70%. She should also not be able to charge her super while in it. Also her dammage needs to be reduced by 20%. And her health by 10%. This will take her from being the most ridiculously overpowered game breaking fuck stick, to being a normal brawler. Or just delete the damned thing.
---
Not to mention Rosa.
---
Good idea
---
Leon, Jesse, Nita and Penny should be “Too young to come to the casino”
---
Sure @VRVicAV210 name
---
If they were that busy, they wouldn't be browsing reddit.
---
Why would you want a cosmetic over something that actually effects the game? Wow
---
Oh I was looking at the wrong post 😂😂
---
There is problems with replays and they need fixing/improvmets. They won't release is to the masses because of how big the player pool is now. They will fry the servers
---
The movies 3 hours long. Browsing reddit does not require you to do that in one sitting
---
Another reason why she is OP
---
Lol 😆
---
What app is that
---
Mortis gang is after you
---
spoiler please
---
Or nah, play the game normally or find a thing called teammates that arnt randoms
---
MAJESTIC!
---
Rosa is fine lol
---
I agree with almost everything. Swap leon and jessie and it will be more accurate
---
The title meant that rosa should get like -10% damage while having the shield up, and rosa is dominating.
---
Shelly isn't good at all. She deserves that f tier
---
I do that as well. Some of want to enjoy doing randoms on occasion. But more than that some of us sometimes come on just for the tokens till we can get on and push later. Some of us have jobs and stuff to attend to. if you dont want it thats ine. Theres a reason why its a toggle switch
---
Oh im do sorry 😔😔

Don’t play with commets, robots, or energy drink to whatever those are. All these things force you to come out and it’s impossible to compete unless you’re using a tank.
---
Good point
---
Can you try to make Rockabilly Mortis?

Yeah

I now just hit 5000 trophies. And and now have Piper!!!

Just use low trophies brawlers so when you lose its easy to recover. Like me i use my mortis stayed at 380trophies  range and my other brawlers are at 460-500
---
Awasome!!

Wow, you’ve got a keen eye. I’ll fix that quickly.

pretty sure its u/coachflapjack

I'm gonna post some video on YouTube, buddy.

The tutorial teaches you how to play. Not how to become the world's best player.

I love this.

EL NACHOOOOO

The name is bad. You should name it "DA ROCKS SPEAK TO ME"
---
Hands of my star power
---
But it teaches you wrong.
---
i have this problem too but my solution is...#####PLAY BRAWLBALL
---
Ellylle, she has the all-seeing eye
---
Always knew Leon was a player
---
Make the center bigger otherwise rico's bullet will kill anyone in side
---
I got 30 before
---
I know that but even if Colt and Mortis were in a team they should face lower players. Colt is on 5k, Mortis is on like 2-3k and I'm on 9.3k, while the opponents are on 8k+
---
You too sir and I hope it comes to brawl stars
---
Oh my god that is goddamn amazing
---
This is by far the most skillful thing in all of brawl stars. Just play with it on training cave so you can get a feel with it
---
me2
---
Woah really? But thanks tho!
---
Is this different between countries? Mother's day is on 26th May.
---
The more you know
---
thank you so much!!!
---
Wow
---
Getting to level 69 is one thing but having 69 XP on the bar with the level 69 is once in a lifetime
---
My english isn't that good, but I have subtitles :) In the future I might also make english videos :)
---
your time will come just be patient i got all my mythics in a 15 day span after not getting a brawler in 3 months
---
If you dont have a level 9 brawler the star power drop rate is 0.0%. This changes absolutley nothing
---
Yea but guy gave credit to guy gave real credit
---
With one or two more matches that explain some basic stuff, like don't be too aggressive, to surprise the enemies how to play that bralwer in that gamemode; these are very important in Brawl Stars.
---
Is that miles moralis i have miles moralis too but it is a leon
---
Id get bull's and Pam's star power because they are very useful and you can use that max bull on robo rumble and boss fight so you can get good rewards. More rewards = more star powers in the long run
---
Hey I’m from HK too!
---
#Yes
---
can't see anything, too
---
But you stole that art...
---
You unlocked 800 free trophies

Yo (11.8k)

Beatifull

yes true
---
Got noped
---
Darryl and Frank?
---
Hi there, hk
---
probably they're teaming
---
God gave u a brain my friend :D
---
We don't post those stuff here
---
Litteral translation  of french brawlers :
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
El Buff
---
Crowback
---
Jin
---
Calling something "Trash" is just another way of saying "This is bad as fuck".  
---
And stop acting so goddamn tough by calling other people trash just because they disagree with your opinion.
---
I wanted Leon and Crow but got Spike instead, still thankful though
---
Dont turn on volume at max
---
Wow! Great! I not have any word! You artist! Can you make Tara's Magic Corner or Rosa's Botanic Laboratory?
---
It literally saying "If you're not the owner" you dumb shit
---
I have circled icon for everything on my phone because theme i used including brawl stars
---
They should be named
---
Corbeau

El Muscle

I just wanted to say that :P

Uh one hour

\*Do you want a offer with the shiba nita sk--\* SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY!

Press 'F'

I'm just saying that there's more polite ways to "rate" someone's work. Don't you think there was effort put into it? Even if you don't like the artist's style you don't have to call it trash ya know

give credit to the original artist in title

Setup lol
---
Let’s all upvote it so maybe supercell sees this!
---
Wow there are two leons!
---
its  answer  not a  question
---
2 months
---
Did you even look at this post? All the shading and the attention to detail on the wood, Supercell wouldnt do that and I don’t see how a simple skin would make the game not kid friendly, I mean the concept of the game is kill the other team to win, isn’t that not kid friendly on its own?
---
Too barley to be able to cheese bottom left if another brawler attracts rockets
---
Is that what this picture is showing? I had no idea!
---
This is not a bot match, this is you in a friendly game with people who have the names bot and a number.
---
Kind of late to say that lol
---
450 tr Dyna 😆
---
It’s fake. If it went from 500+ to 444 it would show rank 20 not 18
---
Are you portugal?
---
Yeeeeeaa pleassee
---
I somewhat recently got Pam.
---
Not a legendary but still the best non-rosa bralwer I have.
---
Maybe disconnected so the bot plays
---
This is not a friendly game with bots, this is an actual match with people with the names "bot (insert number from 1-9 here). There is no exit button at the bottom of the screen so this can't be a friendly match.
---
That's awesome! I got Pam and Piper on the same day but rarely use them
---
Chad
---
Sry. Try doing Crow.
---
What makes you think they did
---
Less hitbox
---
Siege
---
This is a really cool idea!
---
Smooth af
---
👌
---
I got Pam to rank 8 and then I stopped using her. Unfavorable maps and EVERYWHERE I WENT THERE WAS ROSA just meant that at Power 1 I couldn't really have fun eith her no mo.
---
it's basically bushes everywhere.
---
She used to be so strong, but now she's hot garbage
---
What are you? Who are you? Why are you?????
---
Eh? Pam is still pretty great, she's easily one of the best Brawlers overall. Just not as OP as Rosa.
---
Nice
---
i was debating on weather or not to spoiler it but the picture covers the thing anyways so yeah
---
sorry tho :(
---
Awesome but just saying Pocos "guitar" is a Ukulele lol

What is life leech
---
Same situation
---
How is that related in any way
---
When you unlock a brawler, your percentages still drop either way (wether you bought it or got it out of a box)
---
Lol.
---
Some coffee (?) I think she likes it.
---
Imagine being this triggered
---
if you use a phone try photo editor (with blue logo)
---
or just crosspost with this sub
---
gotta give some props for actually crediting in title tho
---
Too easy for barley to cheese*
---
It gives unfair vision advantage tho 😂
---
He was pissed because Dynamike exploded his top hat...
---
that intelligent colt tho
---
2 mouth :)
---
it's not but no need to downvote
---
Vc foi muito trouxa cara, agora aguenta. Já perdeu, o cara ja levou todo o credito.
---
Stop complaigning about free rewards. If the game gives you an average of 13 coins a day, that's 390 coins per month. That's about 50 gems worth of coins, which would cost 3.98$. Supercell is giving you free coins at a loss. FREE COINS. Stop complaigning unless you want all free things to be rewarded.
---
Cant watch it... just me??
---
Well, he lives in a cartoon game universe, he will find a way.
---
Really downvotes for asking a question?
---
I completely disagree. If you’re playing in a team of 3; you should be playing other teams of 3. Your ability for open communication during games doesn’t exist while you’re playing with randoms; so sticking a 3-stack against a team of randoms instantly becomes unfair based on that alone. Let alone the player chemistry difference, the ability to draft an actual functioning team; all of these things would be very imbalanced towards a 3-stack if put against 3 randoms.
---
Thank you 😊 I was kinda already planning the Tara's one, maybe in another opportunity.

How much brawlers you got?

It would just be bounty then.
---
Thanks man
---
oh no!
---
lol How do you get to 300+ trophies by auto-aiming with colt
---
All accept Crow and Spike
---
But with out stars the objective is kills not points above people’s heads
---
If you look closely, I’m controlling the Rosa kk
---
Too good
---
Where did you get Template from? Pls can I use it?

No self-promotion. Do you guys even read the rules?

I love his arts !!!
---
ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 감사합니다. 덕분에 울보님 영상 확인하고 왔어요.
---
Wow thats some really good artwork. This would be awesome to see in the game. Nice job!
---
That's not proof Sherlock. That's a 1% chance dude, it's not like that is unlikely like getting a legendary brawler. If people can get 2 legendary brawlers in one box, then this shit aint proof. Do the math idiot.
---
Omg this skin looks legendarryl
---
2k damage Sparky guns? Take my gems
---
Wow the splash.
---
What trophies cuz I’m at 4.5k and have 1 mythic and no legendaries
---
r/whooosh
---
This is amazing I love your art and wish you the best of luck 
---
P.s. Supercell needs to hire you
---
OMG NOT EVEN GEDI-KOR COULD DO BETTER OMG OMG
---
Nah really it’s more about killing anyone and not having to focus one person who’s dominating. It’s also on a bigger map with power cubes to increase a brawlers advantage over another brawler adding another sense of complication to the mode. It’s a glorified showdown mode with respawns and teams
---
WHY IS THIS SO AMAZING?!?!?!
---
Uh, I don’t know, perhaps almost 300 if the matchmaking is working well kk
---
r/lostredditors
---
Im from türkey
---
This is some of the worst Pam gameplay I’ve ever seen
---
Collect
---
I think its a record.
---
Lemme guess. You play crow in solo showdown instead of as the support brawler he is?
---
Can u give me this template pls where is it from?
---
I have the same but it‘s spike
---

How does Legendary Darryl roll? How does it work? How are you supposed to roll when you’re wearing a chest around you? It doesn’t make any sense. You can’t roll!! You can’t roll like that!! Fine, you can use an egg, and you can use a dumpling barrel, but you can’t use a chest it doesn’t make any sense!! How do you roll with Legendary Darryl?! Does he use wheels?! I don’t see any wheels on him! How does it work?!! I don’t know!! I don’t know how Legendary Darryl works!! Someone tell me!! Please, someone tell me how does it work!! PLEASE!! SOMEONE TELL ME HOW LEGENDARY DARRYL WORKS I NEED TO KNOW!!! I NEED TO KNOW HOW LEGENDARY DARRYL WORKS!!! PLEASE!!! PLEASE JUST TELL ME HOW LEGENDARY DARRYL WORKS!!! HOW DOES IT WORK?!!! SOMEBODY EXPLAIN IT!!! IT’S CONFUSING!!! HOW DOES LEGENDARY DARRYL WOOOORK?!!!HOW DOES IT WOOOORK?!!! **PLEASE!!! SOMEONE TELL ME I NEED TO KNOW HOW LEGENDARY DARRYL WOOOORKS!!! HEEEEEEEEEEEEELP!!!!**

Worms armageddon holy bomb. HALLELUJAH !!!

When I see poco and spike together, and get flashback from "No time to explain"... It realy strange...

But your art so amazing!!!
---
Ya te mamaste

They NEED to add all of your Clash Royale skins into a collection for an event. Maybe an anniversary or something
---
As someone who's been through clash of clans and clash royale, the projected 1 year max time in this game is pretty low compared to the other two.
---
¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Look at my account and whatch a brawler invented by me and his skin that is hisgrandmother  his skin rockstar grandma
---
Confused...but quality editing
---
thicc.

When Rosa came out ;))
---
I honestly love how non-teamers team up against spinning teamers. Then go at each other like it's WW3.  Not sarcasm.  I really do love it and being part of it
---
lmao
---
If you want to win, he is a bit weak at the moment.
---
If you want to have fun, he is one of the best Brawlers to use for that.
---
The artist didn't notice that
---
Today I defeated a bull in 1 minute and 4 seconds... But he was lagging lol 😂. People don’t know to play bug brawler.
---
Brawl Ball is by far my favorite!

  Wait I thought it was too pretty for paying

I'm not blaming teammates

Siege is VERY TEAM COMP dependent and you're playing double the amount of time just to lose double the trophies
---
Siege is very unpopular rn and it is mostly cos of the harsh trophies loss (theres more problems but I'm not talking about thos)

An extra ammo bar would break the game, a lot of those up there would destroy the game.

This....is beautiful in many aspects

Tbh, I think that she's more of a healer, imo.
---
Autoaim doesn't full clip twice good sir.

Funny...I think the opposite. I have genuinely lost some players I regular teammed up with because I refuse to play Seige and just leave anytime it is chosen. People have different tastes.

I think you don’t get it. My post is showing games I had in random against people quite under my trophies, there were easy wins. I said to stop it also. What we only want is to play against people at the same level as ours, not higher not lower. Stop talking about skill, we only talk about matchmaking here.

Cool map (and I get it
---
It's just as hard to survive while getting passive teamed.
---
Spam
---
Then that’s just keeping the brawler the exact same.
---
Nah, because they'll have another slot.
---
Who said a streamer is a top tier player? Why do you assume just because they stream on Twitch that they're good? Assumptions are not good, we need to look at the facts.
---
Yes, he has told me that before. I don't remember which Twitter account of mine it was. I have many, and it was right when the change went into effect a few months ago. They did it purposefully. 
---
Everyone wants to win. Matchmaking right now is a joke, everyone knows it. Luckily he said he's working on it. But until then, their numbers will drop steadily. Good luck to them though.
---
Yep, it's a great one
---
I like the mega knight legs
---
This skin should also cost 500gems and it will be the icing on the cake
---
The real author of the ice spike skin is u/Matheus Crazy (or something like that).It might really seem like the u/lenagatto made it but [this](https://imgur.com/pZO4ocE) proves that Matheus made it a day before lenagatto posted on Reddit. Matheus mistake was not placing a signature when he posted the art to the group. He is innocent and lenagatto is the true art thief

Why do i think its a repost
---
Star power - penny can aim shooting cannon and decrease 20% of reloading.
---
Penny can aim like a cannon.
---
Thats all.
---
I think its could be good rework!
---
Unless you plan on waiting for 20 minutes for your game; you’re not going to find a game of players EXACTLY at your trophies. 
---
Also how is that not an issue of skill?  You said that higher trophy players you lose to; and lower trophy players you clean up easily. Is that not an almost direct correlation of skill?
---
There’s obviously no perfect fix to this issue; but we’re only going to agree to disagree on the fact that playing with players 50-100 trophies above you isn’t an issue at all.
---
Both of them actually doing Showdown to try to be who will be the best at revealing "theirs" to that lucky participant.
---
yes yes i know that i'm just saying that goalie star is one of the best all stars because of the freezing attack
---
Bullshit, you definitely got carl or rosa at some point
---
This was in 330 trophys
---
Yee
---
uhh I only see spectate and profile... I need some help can you explain hoe you got it.
---
iM sUgAr AnD sPiCe!!!
---
Wow just seen this now this is a really nive idea hope to see the next volume soon 🔥🔥🔥
---
idea: from brawl boxes there is a boss battle that gets exponentially harder and each time you beat it you unlock more levels for your brawler
---
for example the rico boss battle you would be battling a super strong rico and for level one he would have like 30k health level two he would have 60k and three he has 80k health and 4 has 100k and 5 has 120k and each time you beat the boss you unlock that level(you still have to pay for the upgrade) and the boss goes to the next level until level 5
---
it’s sorta like boss fight except solo and you have to be rico for the rico fight and the events for boss battle will rotate around like it would go to shelly for one week then nita and so on
---
power cubes will also spawn when you are fighting the boss so you have a fighting chance the
---
i think you're misunderstanding what i mean by passive teamers, i mean they just team but they don't chase anyone, they just stay still and most of the time hide in a bush. For example, everyone there was passive expect that mortis, and the morits died because he was bad
---
I agree with rework,but if he becomes a low damage long range brawler,hew will be poco
---
How did he get the 1 gem?
---
Y’all need to stop sucking him off
---
Im missing mortis gene and all the legendaries and I haven’t gotten a new brawler in well over a month other than Rosa who I bought which shouldn’t affect my chances. My legendary chance is 0,0960
---
Yes
---
This skin is brighter than my future
---
Happy birthday
---
But the digital version is not his too, I had made the paper version and a colleague of mine in the Facebook group of brawl stars asked to do the digital version, he stole the two.
---
dissagre
---
POCO GO LOCCOO
---
it happened to me 3 times this round XD
---
Sorry... I'm new at map making. What would you suggest changing?
---
Not completely...
---
the leveling is missing and the minions.
---
Ohh shoot dude that sucks.
---
oh man I'm just waiting till they release an op unbalanced plant. the last few  brawlers weren't so good at lauch. and they even nerfed one of them.
---
Take this down. You stole it.
---
The Gedi Kor of Clash Royale is here! :D
---
Nice job btw :)
---
So basically legendary trophies from cr how
---
I’m sorry but I don’t speak 600 Iq
---
Beautiful
---
Imagine a company wanting to make a profit /s
---
happy birthday man
---
I'm so sorry you had this happen to you. Your art is really good &lt;3
---
This is amazing
---
u/SirLoner Wondering what do you have to say
---
I use spike
---
I have how to prove, I will send the link of my post on Facebook, and you see the date, my post is older than his post.
---
That’s actually ironic, because people say gene is the best mythic and Tara is the worst

I spadaj mały kipiatoku nikt cię tu nie chce

He didn’t make it
---
he didn’t make it
---
Ahaha
---
THIS CANNOT BE
---
You know that guy u/dariusbrawlstars ? He stole art from u/GEDI-KOR and got the most downvoted Brawl Stars account of all time in less than two days. But you get thousands of upvotes? Get the fuck outta here.
---
u/sirloner would have probably removed it, that scumbag
---
I admit that in the first post I did not put my signature, giving him the chance to steal, but I took the drawing, signed it and sent it here to prove it's my own.
---
Yes. Yes. Yes. Just had my first real hit with this last season. 221 trophies. Gone. My desire to push is at like zero now. Btw, I beat you in a siege the other day 😁
---
Cursed_Brawlstars
---
Sadly thanks to thieves they have to :/
---
Good job
---
Holy shit so smart
---
Gotta love this glitch
---
This is the worst thing I've ever seen
---
Pay to wins gonna dominate
---
Excelent de bun post
---
Now this is legendary
---
If she’s nerfed anymore she’d be trash. Perhaps a slight shield 🛡 damage reduction but that’s it. Going from 6 seconds to 4 was already a huge nerf.
---
Why you team?
---
He's telling him to shoo
---
Nice skin Supercell add this pls
---
Lol the second Fortnite X Brawlstars meme I’ve seen today
---
The sparky's as guns will make him OP
---
There's the old mortis on the left😂
---
If you can help me spread the word, I thank you very much.
---
Totally man
---
facts
---
This is cursed and disgusting. Take my downvote sir.
---
Yes !
---
If he kills you your legendary drop rate increases
---
how do you change it?
---
Removed - Your post is too short, please expand on your title.
---
She is balanced IMO. 4 second super hit her hard.
---
I’m a Darryl main AND I NEED SOOOOOO BAD. 
---
#AHHHHHHHHH
---
I love it so much.
---
TOTALLY AMAZING NO WORDS WOW
---
This is so good, great work
---
Ok thanks
---
Rico likes spaghetti? He’s probably Papyrus in disguise
---
Guys this post is stolen, this guy stole other post as well. Don’t trust anything he post
---
i like nuts
---
Are people having an argument over a drawing?
---
Why do people do this ?!? What to get likes? Fucking stupid. All he will get is hate
---
is sir loner the guy who posted it on IG? It’s the same person?
---
Oh,why you have stolen?Spike de Gelo is portuguese but you are american
---
Someone has to make a Rick Roll version of this
---
He commented in that post saying he drew it with color pastels.
---
Never have never will underestimate him
---
Nah
---
The old reddit switcharoo?
---
Woah
---
Regular cause it just showed the new brawler spins Nd hen the box ended once I got him
---
Sorry, i know it also looks cringe to me
---
thought the exact same 
---
my name is ItzAj24 if you wanna play anytime soon
---
 
---
I play leomord harith Chou and tanks
---
This is actually autistic. Her super is 4 seconds, this happens all the time before the nerf, but SHE ALREADY GOT FREAKING NERFED and isn't even that op anymore. So STFU
---
Reddit Gold! 🎖
---
Considering the highest person is at 6400 that would be really good
---
If I put this in google translate, I could probably get a tangible response
---
More motivation to get good for your opponent I guess. Or to break their phone...
---
Oh ok, you mean edges. Yes, they do have three edges.
---
Take my upvote! ⬆️
---
Yep, that's what happens when you get any Brawler from a Brawl Box. I pulled Leon and Rosa on my 600 trophy mini (like what is my luck how is it so good) and it's just the animation
---
Legendary dude! This is amazinggg
