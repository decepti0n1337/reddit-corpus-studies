he is clearly joking

The number of afk players and trolls in the game recently is through the roof. When the new update came out, I had 6 games in a row in the new game mode that had an afk on my team... Had about 4 games so far where one player kept throwing the gift back to the enemy.
---
BEEEEETCH!

I am waiting here to hunt a good r/woooosh

it's true ....

Petition for Darryl to change class type to "Rolling Heavyweight."
---
Roasted him
---
Really?
---
WTF
---
yes im not made the template.
---
But I REDRAW IT.
---
So it's mean i make the template special for our sub
---
Wow,best post on this sub
---
Guys its works as a downvote too
---
1. Go in the middle.
---
2. Avoid the boxes.
---
3. Wait till someone starts shooting.
---
4. Steal kills.
---
5. Profit.
---

---
This is how I got some of my Brawlers from 100 trophies to 500. Sometimes you would be the only one in the middle and could get all the boxes and sometimes you decided that it's not worth it and go away. It was always the psychological game.
---
But at least it‚Äôs a minecraft stack of games
---
Say Shike right now
---
That's true. I hope they will do something with that.

your post was great... but this template is just everywhere
---
What you have done has made god very unhappy
---
Can we change Piper's one from sharpshooter to sniper like Bea?
---
Well better than scoring the wrong way..... twice

That's from line in YouTube
---
Yeah it sucks so much I wish they kept them exclusive and just made new ones :(
---
No. Piper is a real name. They did the same with Bea. They pick names based on the brawler's features. Piper rhymes with sniper, so they picked Piper.
---
I had something similar
---
Day 1 : I open a megabox in the store and nothing. My friend says "That one won't give you anything, THAT one does" opens free box and gets Piper
---
Day 2 :
---
- Morning : Pam
---
- Evening : Gene
---
- Midnight : Bibi

While I can understand the thoughts behind it and why you and others would like to have something like this I think it's a bad idea on top of a bad system. I'm sitting at 9k for the past months since since I dont see a point in pushing the brawlers I dont like to play for the rewards the trophy road gives.
---
That said I dont want to accuse you of the mindset of "I have done it so I should get rewarded", but while I agree that high trophy players that invested time and effort to push high should get rewarded I think doing it without a complete overhaul would cause several issues.
---
1. An extreme top heavy trophy road, the rewards split over multiple tiers could be okay - &gt; why not do that through a complete rework.
---
2. How many people would benefit from this? Both in terms of players above 15k and none maxed.
---
3. An exclusive skin that people would likely want to see retired after a trophy road change - &gt; how much value does this skin have in terms of value? 30 gems? 150?300? 50k starpower? People would either be unhappy that it's too good or bad. I imagine that only a small minority would get the skin anyway - &gt; 5%?1%?less? This would need ressources to create it and for which brawler? One of the classic low rarity? Do people that own the brawler get something on top?
---
4. Quite a bit of the stuff would only mean more coins for maxed out players which I would dare to guess is not an ignorable amount...
---
While I applaud your effort (though you could have spell checked it a bit better) I think that it wouldnt be a good idea with my main reason being that it's completely unfair for players that are foe example at 12k, 13k, 14k... because they had the same thankless trophy road and now would be punished for not pushing 1k, 2k... more.

Scince darryl was released I've had the idea that darryl should always have his super charged. But instead of it only going a short distance , it would last as long as you wanted. It would take like 2 seconds to get into the barrel, then you could control where you wanted to go. You wouldent be able to attack while rolling but you would be able to travel through the map a lot faster or maybe escape or chase an enemy when needed. It would also take about 2 seconds to exit the barrel, so you would be very vulnerable when in the barrel. Think of it as the citron from pvz gw 2.

So basically, Piper's a hoe
---
Not really it was just shotgun camping
---
*laughs in f2p*
---
They'll be trying to get Bea to the maximum trophies they can get, so there's a higher abundance of the character, as is whenever a new character is released.
---
I srsly wanna cry dude. i opened 130 boxes and 16 big boxes and only got 2 star powers all my hype for the update was wasted and i can only enjoy the new LIMITED mode :(

I have already updated it in another post

What if you don‚Äôt have level 9 brawlers what would you get instead of the star powers. And what would happen when new brawlers are introduced and the trophy road increases
---
Thank you for ruining my day
---
I love tick even if I don‚Äôt have his star power :)
---
if you think it's stupid, don't play it
---
And Piper is a sharpshooter but Bea is a sniper?
---
They should change Piper's class to sniper too(maybe?)
---
My megabox chances for legendary is 0.0909% lol

Sounds pretty damn sick. I'm down for it. Wanna make a petition on change.org or something?

how many boxes did it take?

i agree. spike is just the cutest :3 ( i have it too! )
---
No, I'm the one who's gonna cry.
---
(s)he be lookin‚Äô FIERCE
---
Looks like they wanted it to be thrower friendly judging by all the walls, but it's too open for that by the looks of it. Feels bad
---
I completely agree with you. One feature that I would add, however is that you pass the present if you‚Äôre very close to a specific teammate, in which case it automatically goes to them.
---
Also, if the present is dropped, the present should go back to the starting location in 1-2 seconds. Having it just sit there for too long makes it too easy for a recovered, respawned enemy team to dive in while your team is still recovering and take the present.
---
Will that make a difference? I know Ryan, Dani, and Frank keep tabs on this reddit page so if we get enough upvotes we might have an impact.
---
wut
---
Yeah the reset timer for the present is really interesting.. I also like the idea of after 3 seconds after being dropped, enemies can reset their own present by picking it up.
---
none
---
i bet you used the new improved randons thing ( magnfying glass ) and this guy just chose mortis and you were ok with it :/

No, the only people that should be able to report are the people that were in the match. Even if that wasn't the case dozens of reports coming from a club would be easily filtered out. It's almost as if computers are good analyzing and filtering data.

Thanks

people will not under stand underline snapshooter and sniper

No i dont put them in corners, i put them in random bushes near the center, then wait....

---
yes you can be right
---
If a computer did it, it wouldnt be able to differ unreasonable reporting, also if it was only the people in the match, every person would have two reports making the people with the most reports be kinda useless, as itd be limited to just two people
---
O don't see a problem
---
As I understood,when they said "playing with randons will become better" they meant that they would introduce a new mechanism where you can find plauers before a match starts,so you can organize your strategies before the match starts (exactly like when playing with friends/clubmates)
---
Also,judging from the image,the enemy team was  probably in the same lobby.

The new map "Treasure hunt" is already a paradise for teamers. It's awful. Too many brawlers are staying alive at the start and then they all go slowly to the bushes in the center and the first who takes the initiative will die, that's why they all try to team with each other.  
---
They should add the energy drink modifier to stop the teaming in this map. Looks like they didn't test it before adding it.   
---
At least in feast of famine, those who went to the center had to fight (and die) and those in the edge had to try to survive away from the center , and away from each other (no teaming).

If you have a brawler with less than 300 trophies you will see the name

more like QUARTERBACK BULL

Ow ok thank you

Sandy must've said "teaming is a strategy"
---
Same here gonna be kinda fun
---
If you enter as normal it would be hard for supercell as there could be lots of new ways to manipulate the system and get maxed accounts without buying things. For example lots of game can be glitched with date and time. You could get infinite free boxes on brawl stars with this glitch. They would need to make the shop internet only as well as things like boxes even if you have some ready to open.

Do u are have stupid?
---
They could make it so that you can only play practice matches and not anything else.
---
It's a good ideia for who is traveling and haven't internet
---
owh mah gawd bwest enngrish
---
Hmm Nice Work there ;D
---
But, i played since 1st day of global and theres no big game map like this;
---
In the history pf bs there was only three big game maps,but not this.... xd
---
1 ticket hecc yeah
---
If you don't like something in my post please shut up and go away
---
Yup

I would want this to be a real crossover if this was possible

That‚Äôs not how you reply to a comment.

You‚Äôre supposed to tap the ‚Äúreply‚Äù button under u/I_Like_Stoned_Bread ‚Äòs comment.
---
No one said that
---
Sorry I never watched Jojo
---
Ahahaha
---
I like nothing in your post. Why would they have the skin in game files and not add it? Making a "petition" for this is absolutely ridiculous.
---
Battle: stars

No way! You got a ticket!

---
What a repost
---
I Said that You motivating all of us with your speeches bro
---
THIS IS FRICKING TRUE
---
I count 
---
Gene
---
Penny
---
Bea (without supershot)
---
Mortis
---
Jessie
---
Nita
---
Crow
---
Spike (If he doesn‚Äôt hit 3 spikes) 
---
Sandy
---
Notice a pattern? 
---
Gene, penny, bea, mortis, Jessie, poco, Nita, and sandy deal guaranteed maximum amounts of damage if they land 1 hit on the enemy brawler. If you hit an enemy with max, it‚Äôs easy for a few of the bullets to miss even if you aimed perfectly because of the delay it takes for it to the shoot, and the low travel speed. 
---
Only crow and spike are the two brawlers that don‚Äôt deal guaranteed maximum amounts of damage. Crow is a character to keep the enemies at bay, so his DPS doesn‚Äôt really matter as most of his damage comes from poison at long ranges, and spike is area denial. 
---
What is max? Nothing really. Just feels like a less accurate colt with half the damage. 
---
My aim is fine.
---
Ah yes Leon knows what we all are thing and not thinking (joke no offence)
---
Bea I think
---
Cuz youre not og. I remember this sht. First ever map that was made for this. It was in beta btw  good ol times
---
No you can't, your trophies and boxes are handled server side. If a date glitch existed you wouldn't need an offline mode to activate.
---
Modders already tweak the game to get instant reload and infinite supers but they only work in friendly games.
---
I want to be your in-game-friend
---
That would be soooo good
---

---
chameleons don't wear shoes,do they?
---
LUCKY!
---
OK.
---
BULL-dozer.
---
No, it did work, i remember very clearly playing a practice game offline without getting kicked out, ofc you could only play that one game which you had to play on wifi which then switched off
---
Frick I don't have Rico.
---
You had it....You had the chance to make Poco in the Sans version...
---
This subreddit is a lie Kairos isnt even a mod
---
Bluetooth only really works between 2 devices. Maybe it could be done but it would be bad. Wifi is the way to go and it's been a thing for PC games for a long time.
---
Discord tournaments aren‚Äôt competitive dip shit. Clubs do that shit for fun.
---
Go watch the PBL. Semifinals and finals are in two weeks. Not a single team will run Max or Bea. Because if two teams of pros face each other with real money on the line, they‚Äôre gonna pick good brawlers. And btw, Yde, Bobby, patchy, og, Chepo....all the big names in Europe and North America compete in PBL. Secondbest might pick Max to troll. But then again he self scores in competitive play because he‚Äôs toxic. I will bet you any number of dollars I‚Äôm right. Name the price.
---
it doesn't work QwQ https://link.brawlstars.com/invite/friend/en?tag=9CYRCY2LL&amp;token=j2nt3ymk this is mine if u wanna play (I also have 14k trophies :P)
---
this was made before
---
which brawler do you play on this map then? from what i see, only throwers suck.
---
Um I don't think that the meme works like that
---
La noi √Æi groaznic oricum
---
A copy of that data is stored locally though, modders make [infinite reload](https://youtu.be/sUy61bnu4Fw) and custom skins for offline play.
---
true. this was the Ricochet remodel we never knew we always wanted.

I think they should decide the rank in terms of damage dealt to enemies not the one who got the kill like takedown
---
I'm 28 years old. From the way you behave and the manner in which you think you are tough, I'd say you're right about in your puberty. If anything, I should call you a kid. But I won't, it's just disrespectful. I'll call you a dumbass, which is far more accurate because if you had any brains or respect you would not be posting this topic or posting at all. Your three highest brawlers are literally auto spamming little-skill brawlers, all of which can auto spam Max to death
---
Now your the one acting like a moron smh
---
You idiot... I AM IN PRO BRAWL LEAGUE

Jack chepo  along with Bobby and OG is Literally in the same cash prize tournaments I‚Äôm in...

They made pirate ship for Darryl

Frank didn't got a remodel, they updated his model, this is why Caveman Frank didn't get any changes but for Penny sorry i don't know ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
---
Cool, but do you guys eat pancakes for breakfast?
---
Oh, I don't want anymore Christmas skins, I think we have enough. This was just a joke of my reaction to all the different things in the update
---
who used the festivalizer on spike
---
Based off my experience Leon is already nerfed enough and is pretty much only good against most brawlers with high power cubes.
---
I rate spike voice and darryl voice 0/10
---
I THOUGHT IT WAS THE FEELING WHEN. MY LIFE HAS BEEN A LIE.

When you go against a russian –ë–õ–≠–¢ or against an italian GX you know it's an automatic win.

ok...and?

Amico mio, questa √® una sub inglese, non si parla in italiano porcaccio di un dio

No one likes campers

Make Frick next, if nobody made it before (Frank + Tick)
---
everyone will just use penny to hit the brawlers behind lol
---
?
---
But Thousand Lakes got ruined
---
How?
---
its not bad. if you dont like it just dont play it
---
Is that fake if not have fun its fake
---
And my other friend are worse than me. Its just unfair
---
I think it‚Äôs somewhat interchangeable, but always heard it as the face when
---
  Yeah, I can agree that there is a lot of actually stupid Russian players, but If you try to offend them... why are you offending ALL Russians with this meme? There is actually a lot of great RU players too
---
Bea is stronger
---
BURN in HELL for your HEINOUS use of the *LORD'S NAME*
---
Wtf is this shit?
---
I never liked the old one because it remindes me too much of the Dragon Ball robots, i couldn't think at anything else while seeing him. For me he was never Brawl Stars but Dragon Ball.

ohhhh...

First time?

If its a fanbase sub then you shouldnt have named it KairosSubmisson cause if Kairos wanna make a submisson sub of his own then he couldnt cause you already taken the name
---
Ikr i definitly noticed that since i saw the youtubers sneak peek videos, normally only Hog Rider Carl and Captain Carl aren't shrunk
---
Not getting brawl stars besides SANSEON
---
Buy leon(for me)
---
I mean Bea is stronger right now, I unlocked her so I know, but Leon is way harder to find so I would be very happy if I would have found a legendary before unlocking all the epics, because finding an epic means decreasing your legendary drop rate, Bea is not that hard to find, you'll find her anyway

Korea people love brawl stars so much while my country blocked supercell games on chplay and appstore :( (still have ways to download)
---
You are using No Hat Mortis, it's a sin.
---
There is no bug! The obly bug in this game is bee!(xddd)
---
I think it's the drink from her animation
---
What? The fact that you have max? There‚Äôs no need to flex man
---
Dude I mostly use top hat ,I am saving up for rockabilly mortis
---
Shhh ;)

This meme has been done a million times, but I'm sure you'll say you didn't knowüòí

Cool

I didn't know gnomes could run

When someone steals your power cube so you steal their lungs
---
You would probably be happy about the 100 Coins compensation instead of Leon + Skin. ;)
---
He barley uses reddit though, and also it's just a submission of posts about him it's still a fan base
---
Repost?

Ah, yes MAX + SPIKE = MIKE

What repost?

No üò≠
---
Hehe

Task Failed Successfully
---
–ò–≥—Ä–∞ —Å—É–ø–µ—Ä
---
This would be great
---
The best choice you can make is to buy Leon as it is not worth leaving your gems to spend on tickets or token duplicators since for you to win a legend or a mythical is a bit unlikely and random so as you just need These two brawlers I would indicate buy the Leon.
---
(Sorry for my english)
---
I think that it should be like a testing version of the game. Like you could pick a brawler that you can play with and modify its power, which you could play with bots
---
Yes that‚Äôs what I do usually but trying to kill him in Siege is so frustrating, it‚Äôs been 7 games and i‚Äôm slowly becoming mad
---
You‚Äôre just bad at it
---
No, it's not. Modders have made completely offline versions. If some modders can do it unofficially with no source code, it would be super easy for Supercell to do it.
---
Removing jessie completely, so she cant be the boss. People can chose from other 30 brawlers so it won't be a big deal. They've made takedown which is the worst gamemode instead of removing jessie.
---
She just has an addiction
---
Yeah I got the skin because it was discounted during the summer but now it‚Äôs overused
---
I guess. We used to have those back in my days I think. Nonetheless, a great idea
---
Chek ourlt my video plz vote i vote yours
---
I've had it where I don't even get into the match and I lose trophies though. That definitely needs to get fixed.
---
That is different and totally needs to be fixed

Bro what's the connection between rosa and shelly?

What is your name on Brawl Stars?
---
Can‚Äôt say much on him, but after taking a break from the game... I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm rusty with Mortis or what. I used to be great with him, but now I feel like he isn‚Äôt fast enough to justify being useless in all other attributes. And so if you have even one other team member who isn‚Äôt bringing their A-game, Mortis just becomes not good enough. But get a good team with him... and you‚Äôre golden. I don‚Äôt know, for a character who is solely relied upon for speed.... he isn‚Äôt fast enough. Or he isn‚Äôt strong/durable enough to matter.
---
Waarom zegt idereen dat
---
I think chicken primo is going to haunt me in my slumber
---
What did the second 1 give
---
I faced Ash in SD once. He was Darryl, and he suicided into a Shelly, which did enough damage for me to kill her for the win.
---
I got a solution for you
---
MORTIS
---
no
---
probably
---
But what would players who have every brawler get? this seems nice but it would just annoy end game players since new players get for free what they waited a long time for. 
---
Same reason why they cant add a legendary at the end of trophy road like some have asked for
---
South, I'd assume?
---
You looking at me? I'm the boss of bosses
---
In my experiences she‚Äôs op, BB she can‚Äôt be stopped unless someone is actively being a goalie, showdown she charges her super by toying with you then uses it to kill you/you and your partner, gem grab she can just charge over to the other side,
---
Ok got you
---
I also appreciate that everyone gets at least in powercube before going to mid
---
Idk wait I'll send you a link to the video
---
leon has entered a state of chronic depression

It already has it. Playing with boys is already technically ‚Äúplaying offline‚Äù

But what about the brawlers abilities? It would take too much work to do it, i play online pc games, and I don't think a single one of them has offline play because the servers need to be reached in order for the game to function.

"If it bothers you that much buy yourself a gift card or receive one for your birthday or get one on a holiday like Christmas and buy a bunch of tickets." See? What part of my sentence doesn't make sense in this kind of comment?
---
The OP in this comment states, that if you're whining not getting what you want, you should buy the stuff you want to have. The thing is, that many people can't either afford or don't have the permission to buy gems. Let alone the probability of getting a legendary is very slim, but still reachable on an f2p account.

You could replace Piper with Max or Brock and the whole thing would just loop
---
Trophies aren‚Äôt a great metric of how many boxes one has opened ‚Äî which is the only real way to assess your probability. Technically I can push to 15K trophies in a month playing nonstop, but it doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôve opened many brawl boxes and therefore having no legendaries wouldn‚Äôt be surprising.
---
Idk if you're referring that hes argument was bad or just notifying us that yours is. 
---
Its pitiful to try to make an extreme "metaphor" and then end up making no sense.
---
Thought that was me till I saw the spike and leon
---
It should be dynamikes
---
Her projectiles travel too fast for most to dodge because to deal the most amount of damage in the shortest period of time the team has to get close to Jessie and that means that there‚Äôs too little time to react.
---
I hope you can buy the skin whit star points
---
Great achievements require great sacrifices and there stands someone to accept sacrificial offerings.

I think he isn't a f2p at all

When i took this ss i had only bull as well but now i have jessie and 4 other 9 levels. But the thing is i was first. It was 3 vs 1. But they thought i am easy target so killed each other. And I killed the last shelly.

Brawl stars team I would like to say a review about your game and would very much like to hear from you.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Brawl stars have a lot of potential, but one problem I see a lot is about the trophy system, whenever someone loses trophies they give a certain rage and this is not good for the following facts: most players who play casually just to have fun they get angry and stop playing, because losing trophies does not make anyone happy and at the time the person will want to stop playing.
---
I know that messing with this is trickier because it's part of the game system, but it's a tip to me that no one misses trophies in standard modes and only competitive modes so all types of players can enjoy themselves.
---
( I used the google translator)
---
This would also work with Nita
---
Nah theres not enough plastic
---
This is big brain time
---
Why not
---
This is so cute! I love how you drew Leon. Maybe I should do it like that
---
Lol thank you
---
I agree. She used to be my favorite brawler but now she is my least favorite
---
Credit to u/Jaysun__ go check his/her account!
---
Edit: nvm its nsfw
---
Because we don't care if you're salty about people having legendaries.
---
Buy Leon, i think is better OwO
---
You don't care, the guys who upvoted does.
---
u didnt get all the coins, as u can see it is still at 100%
---
Interesting pov
---
I wish I had pirate colt equipped just to have an easy gun fight lol
---
I see that too. I've rarely seen it inside the game though. I have seen afks, but like twice during the last month or so - not nearly as much as this subreddit suggests. I wonder if this is just because the few times such incidents do happen are so noticeable.
---
Takedown was not meant to kill the boss robot , it was created to get killed and pissed off by the other players .... man I hate Takedown , but honestly tho .. it's a little better than '' Steal Stars '' .
---
Why? Just curious.
---

I got my only legendary and 2 out of 3 of my mythical from mega boxes, so can't relate.

It says NO, so there are no local leaderboards.

Considering there is no oil or trash I assume it's not in Brazil either.

Bruh the bottom picture summarizes my whole life

Incredible! I like the thick outlines for each brawler, they look just alike to the actual in-game brawlers! I hope to see more art from u!

Nice work! Looks almost exactly like in-game!

Removed. Keep your post titles descriptive and provide context. Additionally do not use low effort/all caps/clickbait titles.

great job on rework. i only need to paste this again as the old post got removed.

actually there are few things that would change the game weirdly. you need to firstly buff dmg or stuff on lvl 1, then you add 40% of this dmg and you get dmg on level 9. so, if piper's attack would be 2300 on lvl 9, then on power 1... it would be around 1642,857. pretty strange and specific, am I right?
