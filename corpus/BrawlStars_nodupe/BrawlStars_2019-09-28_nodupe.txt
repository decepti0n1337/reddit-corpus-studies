Really great idea tbh
---
---
---
Thank you üòä
---

---
The wine bottle is the starting point of my idea of a "French Barley" üòâ
---
This is adorable!
---
What's with the black-out at 0:12 though?
---
thank you :)
---
Ok
---
Stop being a hater people will do what they want so please stop and I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs bad to speak up but please stop being mean to these people and let them enjoy whatever I hope you will take this advice thank you
---
Thanks!
---
Yes but I feel like it should be a good Shelly skin and she shoots the brawl stars logo
---
Very good.
---
Wow, it took me a few seconds to realize this wasn't a Nita fan art
---
no i made a sarcastic joke and you coudlnt get it and you are just being toxic
---
:/
---
Gj
---
The brawlers you listed are all epic or higher. 
---
25 boxes is not a lot, your chances of getting Spike from that are probably somewhere around 5%. Mythics not far behind that.
---
This is super adorable!
---
that is such a good idea! have my upvote :D
---
Just suspense lol üòÇ
---
Your rank is wrong.. Penny literally throws gold coin bags
---
You just got a free Upvote.
---
That doesn‚Äôt change the fact she‚Äôs a pirate
---
Um sorry I have spike I just grab him so I could play as him
---
The one that is supposed to be op doesn't have bad cropping at all
---
Showdown is probably the best trophies/time investment right now, so play that. 
---
Play Duo if you're lacking confidence, or if you're seeing a lot of teaming you don't want to participate in.
---
Try to push your brawlers evenly so your overall skill improves, and because pushing is easier at lower levels.
---
Otherwise maybe check out some tutorials for general gameplay tips.
---
Well it worked for that I guess, ha... I was a little worried Bruce had gone feral there.
---
Tbh ur not wrong
---
this is such an amazing idea, especially for f2p players!!! have my upvote so supercell can see this!!! :D
---
Sweet, great job!
---
Me two I have spike in my account no wonder I don‚Äôt have 3 of the legendary
---
same but with a mike in heist when the safe's on 10%
---
See you in hot!
---
Do you have any favorite GG maps or do you play them all?
---
I really like double swoosh and minecart madness but I don't find Crow works really well on all of them.
---
Is it probably because ive ran out of normal brawlers to get, so at this point of the game it gets harder to acquire new ones?
---
what do u mean by brawlers? bc that would make earning new brawlers too easy, right?
---
i love the 15k mark, its still challenging to get there and is a point where the road ends right now so its be a great new start
---
.....   ..... u/The_trash_artist
---
WTF IS HAPPENING HERE
---
Should we remove random option ? 
---
What's the point of random then ?
---
There's timing issues, that's why I can't play with friends mostly. Also it doesn't hurt to improve matchmaking doest it ?
---
Thank you for believing in my work üòÅ
---
I could attempt to make a joker version of Leon if you are interested?

Yup

Verde is for grandmas
---
Really epic idea tbh
---
definatley!
---
Gedi-kor is highly overrated
---
Barl√©
---
Yes not easy to get around new concepts. Some players just want Leon to remain aesthetically untouched vs seeing what he could look like in something other than a hooded costume. I find it refreshing to see if he could actually pull this off.
---
Bear hugs make the world go round.
---
Sometimes you have to think outside the Hood XD
---
Yeah
---
His old description was that he lost all his fans and something else i don‚Äôt care the point is that he is poor
---
No problem! I hope to see more in the future!
---
Hahahahah
---
Halfway done...will color it in and post sometime tomorrow.
---
I wanted to see his face so bad... I have no clue how the community will respond to it.
---
Hopefully not to harsh XD
---
Would you mind adding me so we can team up?
---
Agreed, shelly is ass and not fun to play, shes so easy to get wins with.
---
Atleast let it be a choice to choose which brawler the skin goes to.
---
Maybe
---
Oh haha
---
You can finish the middle challenge in one match. And if your passive enough. One counter
---
Brock: I was lagging!
---
Everyone Else: Aw sh*t, here we go again.
---
piper needs her gloves back
---
You don‚Äôt really have to rely on boxes. I got most of mine from the shop with coins. I don‚Äôt have Sandy yet, but I have all star powers except for 4.
---
very good but add some details and bigger moustache barley has much more big moustache
---
Nothing wrong with my router. And if it‚Äôs just my router, why were so many other people in the game lagging, my router?
---
Pushing is not dumb, the skill gap is still present.
---
If u were the top player who got 25k b4, u could reach 30k.
---
If u were 8k u could get to 10k
---
Etc. Skill gap is still the same.
---
The super should have more range and push back players 1.5x bibi to begin with. It currently is underpowered for a super that requires 7 hits to charge
---
Poco is richer than piper. He is literally god, and if we don‚Äôt grovel before him, he will incinerate us with one note from his trusty guitar
---
uwu
---
Thanks for the advice! So the handle on top didn‚Äôt need supports? You printed it sideways like the file comes? Seems crazy since it‚Äôs a completely horizontal overhang...
---
I‚Äôm currently trying it with supports but I anticipate it‚Äôs going to be a pain to break free. Cura‚Äôs supports are kind of aggressive.
---
I‚Äôll try it without supports the second time, maybe I‚Äôll get fancy I do it multi color like you.
---
Thanks for the inspiration, my daughter is really excited to have a brawl box IRL :)
---
They stopped supporting android x86 devices.  Idk what devices that include, but might be the problem
---
It should be a reference too one punch man, cause she one shots with her super
---
Mine was .2113 when I pulled Sandy
---
Bruh if the average is 6k I'm fucked. I just want more boxes in the road lmao I'm 16k and I need 3 legys still
---
Oo that‚Äôs a cool idea! I would buy it if it was in the game :D
---
me waiting for my parents to stop talking to tell them I shit the bed
---
Shelley is low skill cap
---
Maybe he just wanted to switch brawlers.  Wouldn't be nice if we could do that on the "play again" screen?
---
I went for the head
---
Spike evolved
---
No
---
Now is Bullshit's great day of terror! None dare to molest, or make afraid.
---
That's always been the case...
---
Time&gt;skill
---
But there‚Äôs no -ooooh
---
Weird
---
Yes! Considering u have a .1359% chance of getting a legendary from each card draw (there are 3 in a small box, so every small box u get u will have about a .4% chance to get a legendary. It‚Äôll take like 200 boxes
---
Thank you for actually giving the link
---
Ok, the first thing you'll say is "go get a life, you made 10 posts already"
---
And to that i say no. Drawing is basically my life, i do digital art and my pc broke so i had to use up time drawing while my pc is being fixed.

Thank you all for answering!

Crow- name change

Extra Daggers
---
Leon- unchanged
---
All these are suggested and not compulsory to follow
---
Sorry dude, you deleted the old post I put this on and I didn‚Äôt notice :/
---
SKIRMISHER + SUPPORT = Fighter
---
shake my head my head
---
Great idea don't see this coming. It will be like giving free skins.ü§îü§î
---
Why?
---
So this is long overdue but first the general reworks.
---
1. Tara‚Äôs super should not be hard countered by walls. If a target is in the range of her well but behind a wall they should be dragged through a wall.
---
2. Tara‚Äôs super should cancel the ability to attack. It has happened to me many times where I get killed by someone being dragged in and it doesn‚Äôt seem fun.
---
3. Tara‚Äôs super should be less punishing when you miss. Now it‚Äôs your fault when you miss a super but it isn‚Äôt extremely hard to however it feels impossible to charge it back up, I have four ideas to fix that.
---
A. Have it so each SP does help charge her super, the attacker will recharge a whole cards worth of your super (which is 1/14, but don‚Äôt quote me on that) and the healer does half a card  for each health blast.
---
B. Increase Tara‚Äôs super range by .5-1 tile completely around the circumference of her super.
---
C. This is one I think should be done regardless of what option you choose but decrease the time it takes for her gravity well to be cast by 50%.
---
D. This is an extra SP idea that would make it that as soon as Tara cast her super she gets 1/3 to 1/2 of her super automatically back.
---
4. The shit that happens in the clip is probably a glitch and definitely needs to be fixed.
---
Happy cake day OP
---
How long  is your toothbrush (in cm)
---
ok
---
Flair checks out
---
Well I think it‚Äôs because my trophy count is higher than all the other gene players in the US
---
*WonderBrad laughter*
---
*Pillar man theme plays*
---
Uh! Thats a good idea! (I want Legendary Brawler in 10000 trophies okay?) )
---
Like how they come out with broken brawlers like pre patch Leon and Rosa
---
No, no i didn't mean that, Just asking why are we here on earth? Is there even a purpose for this all?
---
Bruh this is me at exactly 8:25 AM on weekdays üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
I think Bo being a fighter instead of a sharpshooter annoys me more. Dude literally uses a bow and arrow
---
I think our trophy count is just higher than people who aren‚Äôt here on earth
---
Tara isn't unemployed she is a fortune teller. So not great money but money still
---
At least you got the Leon's sister
---
Cry more brawler babies.
---
Happy 99th birthday Joseph Joestar!
---
You evenly got your brawlers to a good spot but when someone has 1 brawler that's about 20% of their total trophies is an issue, if they were at 10k and had a 700 trophies shelly no problem but when you are super low on trophies it shows skill if you have all your brawlers even not just use a semi broken brawler to push trophies
---
And if u had more time u could win more than those who didnt am I not correct?
---
And now high trophy still has that lol, just higher than it used to be.
---
Things to grab as gene :
---
Bull
---
Shelly
---
Rosa
---
Darryl
---
Gene that is pulling another gene which is pulling another gene

I fourth this

Btw, the word you're looking for is ‚Äúfixed‚Äù, not ‚Äúrepaired.‚Äù While both have literal meanings that make sense here, fixed can mean ‚Äúcorrected‚Äù whereas repaired implies it was broken to begin with.

Bro brawl stars should add time in game so you can play during morning, midday, sunset, night, etc. the video looks like almost sunset-ish.

Why did they do that?

What the actual hell

r/unexpectedjojo

Not everyone is p2w.Also judging from your level of mortis and his trophies,I can say that you don't play the game good either.This game isn't about power level.It is about skills.Example"I have a power 8 Tara and I have 800 trophies with her,most of people I play against are level 10 and still I win

exept bulls already healed 2 much
---
Hmm yeah I think it‚Äôs about whether the fight is a waste of time or not. I think both sides can be right sometimes. The one I don‚Äôt like is when they‚Äôre clearly wasting both of our time, eg the robot is on the other side of the map and they‚Äôre chasing you around/in the other direction for 30secs+. Neither person benefits since it‚Äôs just giving others the opportunity to rack up damage. But to your point it is not a waste of time if you are stopping active damagers.
---
I feel attacked ...mr and my 13k won't stand for this

Plus you know that you can get reported to the police right?

13k today plus and say ‚Äúi dont even have a legendary‚Äù slant has to go

Did I ever say that?

Nice

Mh, Fair enough

No, fuck people who make posts like this.

I'm at 12k for 2 seasons and have played since global, I don't have GENE or ANY LEGENDARY IN THE GAME

Idk why but it looked very clean. Also great job

Oh I'm crying haha

i don't know that to say, but i like it

And Leon's design was latest so there's no need to remodel him u clown

why is he in an oven

STAHP THIS BULLSHIT oh wait...

*Intense posing*

thats excatly what I though

my chance is 0.0806

It‚Äôs not the bloody matchmaking FFS! They‚Äôre just in a party.

What do you mean

No, even without super I enjoy killing you. However, usually I have Leon's flair , so it's even better to see you die from my shurikens

Wut did u Dodge ?

boohoo, so sad, crying over ficitional characters.
---
It‚Äôs nothing but impatience with you people,  huh? Doesn‚Äôt matter how hard they work, you want more. Doesn‚Äôt matter how F2P the game is, you will always want more! More, More, more, more, never ends. Supercell could add 10 more Brawler‚Äôs, shit, 10 more everything. Doesn‚Äôt matter. More, more and more.

boss fight was the original name of it before they changed it to big game

Hi guys, Tara here to explain the joke. So basically, when you get on brawl tv, means that a lot of players are watching you and you become nervous and sweaty. At the end, you still managed to get first place, which is amazing because now you can show all of these poeple who watched you that you're actually good.
---
Thats my other acc i have proof
---
Its my troll acc
---
The french aren‚Äôt like that
---
And why did you posted twice then?
---
Hi guys, Tara here to explain the joke. So basically, attacking people instead of the robot in takedown is a dumb move. So dont do it.
---
I hated that too. I even quit after that because I couldn‚Äôt keep up with everyone pushing way faster than me just because they had more time. I would win with skill before and progress faster than them but not after that update. I‚Äôve started playing a bit each day after this update though.
---
sorry i only serve drinks
---
When things go on the internet they no longer belong to you, they belong to everyone.

Yeah see for ur self i deleted the post

way to op for throwers

Yaa

yes but missing 3 other legendaries

what do you want to say?

After seeing such a good idea after browsing Reddit so much, it fills you with determination.

Okay then :)

it's really worth it

My brother has his lvl10 Jessie at 49 trophies for this reason. Took a couple of hours to go from 700+ to 49(Lowest possible AS u dont loose trophies at &lt;=49). He hits 4min+ at most times, tho he is just doing it for fun not the boxes

It looks cool

It‚Äôs so sad, u/tacotacocaat has so little talent and is a little bjtch who only learn NOTHING about values. Steal people‚Äôs posts, rude speech, I‚Äôm wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if anyone told me your Mother doesn‚Äôt love you.

R/loweffortmemes

Yes, dumbass. That‚Äôs the rule of the internet. What is it? Do you own Brawl Stars? Your clips are of a game, which you don‚Äôt own, so you tubers can do whatever they want. IPP laws don‚Äôt say against that.

---
Lmao just copy all the other shitty compilation channels, either way, while you won‚Äôt get copyright striked you‚Äôll still need their permission. I learnt this the hard way when my 15k sub channel was blocked from ad rev for 6 months
---
I did think. Do you really believe that the people addicted and playing 10 hours a day won‚Äôt be trying to grind the wins?? Just because you remove the timer doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs any healthier. In regards to the star points, if you‚Äôre in the top trophy ranges, you would also be reaching the 50k star point goals eventually, but people are unhealthily grinding for it.
---
That means he is extremely lucky. Or maybe he just got all the tockens every day so that he didnt miss out on a box. But still, very lucky if he is f2p.
---
Get Banned
---
I feel like throwers are gonna dominate, Good map anyways.
---
goodluck!
---
atleast the meta will change a bit some brawlers like bull or piper need a better super
---
Lol
---
Or mortis skin remodel
---
Get nae nae'd
---
Seems like barley is the only brawler that exists.
---
Bull is alright if you can use him right,Piper is very good in my opinion
---
rip Frank
---
Cmon. All brawlers have weaknesses and throwers are weal against mortis. The knockback to enemies far away with dynamikes BA is so op
---
My English is not the best...
---
I really like that idea. That would mean if you play the game a lot you can expect to get a legendary sooner.
---
Which would help me cause my lvl is 132 and I don't have one. I even know someone who is lvl 160 and doesnt have a legy and that's just ridiculous.
---
Jesus Christ my guy
---
Yeah i need it :( I'm trying so hard to not buy these skins and it's hard
---
i am only 88 lol
---
Oh yea I forgot about frank... RIP...
---
Same as soon as i got him I got him to 512
---
yeah bull's super is either getting close to enemy or escape there is no other use to it

You are Yde's friend, right? I saw you on his vids.
---
But before that we will have Cyvlops Barley in Halloween
---
You guys have Spike?!
---
Finally a good meme
---
No you didnt, you commented on mine! Next time maybe!
---
Yeah it does, but since you have all the brawlers, your gonna have so much to push, can you imagine? 1260 √ó 29 that's a lot, so I agree with yours its a good point but really if you think about it I am slightly correct
---
Take a loaf of bread, put it in a dirty canal for a week, give it the personality of a spoilt toddler then give said loaf of bread a Reddit account. The result will be this monstrosity that deserves an IP ban.

I'm glad to see something different and interesting.
---
Higher than mine. I have a chance of 0.1161, and yet I only have one mythic and one epic, and Im already at 8k.
---
Yeah im close with yde, what vid was i on i dont remember lol
---
What
---
Ok so the fact that you got a legendary that you had a 0.1 percent chance is nothing? and buying legendaries doesn't count as ' not getting a brawler ' if you only have the legendaries remaining to get you will struggle getting them but according to probability you WILL get them. Remember when Kairos opened 1000 boxes and didn't get Leon? Consider yourself lucky
---
Same.
---
Sorry ich habe deinen post erst gesehen Nach dem ich meien Schon hoch geladen habe üòï

I mean, you were the one who got salty because someone said his posts were shittty... What a loser! Keep making your amazing posts, kid, and don't reply, because you will just show how salty you are, and I will be right

its not brawlers' fusions, so yeah here an upvote

You can DO IT!

O. Totally agree. Can‚Äôt stand without this. Jeez. That no one thought about this. Unbeleaviable. (I have honestly no clue what you just said. This isn‚Äôt an English sub for nothing)
---
#OH IS THAT? SO FUCKING INCREADIBLE. WOOOW
---
Yes,
---
In the Spanish translation Sandy's description says "Sandy es un brawler" The word "un"  Indicates that Sandy is a man
---
I have felt worse -48 on Dyna twice and -49 for mortis once

Wooooooooooooooooooooooooow

Pls stop

It's ok

very easy indeed

YOU DON'T EVEN PLAY FIRE EMBLEM...

You can even see this frame on 2x speed

Yes, until it was easy
---
Takedown be like: spawn as far away from the boss then when you get near the boss a 10 powercube Shelly one shots you and the process repeats
---
Perfectly balance , as all things should be
---
Yes he can...

It said 4 when I opened it :(

Graveyard. See( no time to explain) video.
---
But then you are the black guy smiling with yellow glasses cuz you are shelly with a super
---
He does just as much damage if not more than nita and it was the spread of poco and the star power is insane
---
That‚Äôs satisfying
---
I am totally with you , i know shelly and bull are spam as fast as you can but man tick is based on your aiming so its basically high skill capped!
---
Wheres the reverse card i know shes hiding it somewhere
---
He is banned
---
450 coins and 2 tickets from the megabox.

We gonna run

Nah he is the original creator (go check his profile) he just added the meteors icon

You can have every skin in the game for like $100. That‚Äôs not the kind of revenue per player that Supercell is looking for. They need the players that continue to spend on both skins AND progression
---
Guys Im...

Loving this artwork! Keep up the good work! :‚ô°

Made an oppsie on the title :p

Dude, I don‚Äôt have friends that play brawl stars (except some randoms that I friended that are usually not online) so how the fuck am I supposed to counter act the bullshit

why'd this get downvoted lol

I mean 500 free trophies as in you have 500 then hyper bear takes you to 1000 trophies
---
Just some dark backstory of Tara
---
Carlito or Carlos would both work. He could ride a bull instead of a rail cart. But what would he throw? Tomatoes would be my guess.
---
he doesnt want to go to school, like everyone
---
mega box is just 10 brawl boxes
---
XDXDDDDDDDDDDD
---
bruh
---
Somebody help me understand XD
---
No ?
---
Oh thanks
---
They have sex
---
If you recently hit 10k don't complain about not getting a legendary.
---
I dont like colored boys
---
U can do the same thing with frank, except one time i got 24k
---
Lwarb beta. Woosh me
---
That was cruel man
---
STOP! You‚Äôre giving them ideas!
---
Thanks
---
Out of the three I could argue ticks the best thrower as of now at least. A person with a decent skill cap can easily aim people down. If they‚Äôre not good at aiming, he‚Äôs your go to area of  denial guy. His super is more balanced in my opinion and I think it‚Äôs hilarious to see people running away from the head, but the main attack needs to be changed or reworked.
---
No !
---
Yep
---
Idk and reaper is having fun
---
On my first mega it was a 49 gem one.. Got Darryl Rico piper pam and Frank üíé
---
i only have poco maxed and still no star power
---
Can confirm. Got Crow at 6.5k months ago. I‚Äôm at 12k now and my only mythic is Mortis and not a single mega box has given me anything worth it (I‚Äôve bought 2, and never again)
---
Who even plays mortis in big game kek
---
‚ÄúPost me, expose me, I don't care, this art will be mine. It's fun and I don't care about other people's rights I have fun on the internet and I can if I want to‚Äù
---
But as you go to attack a frank supers you and they destroy you
---
Lots of effort put into this! I like it!
---
Its like brawl stars but with hacks and You can only play friendly game with bots
---
Yeah you‚Äôre lucky‚Ä¶ idk why it‚Äôs hard to get legendaries
---
its not about it being in the vid, but that they got gems for that.
---
Woah thanks
---
Thank you!
---
i mean, you're not wrong.
---
Now this would be awesome
---
he has spike
---
Me neither I had a 0.5% first one and 0.08 on the next one I got (at least I think so)

NO but I have Leon

EL PRIMITO

Repost, please be more original ffs

Great ideas but I don‚Äôt see to much use for the Stationed Scarecrow star power since if you only get the shield when you aren‚Äôt doing anything.

Filthy DM haters

Rare 2 euro coins.

I had crow like 30481017485 years ago

I miss all the other legis, tara and mortis

Yeah I was just messing

It‚Äôs ok

I know lol
---
r/lazyredditors

Oh ok good
---
Just make Pam skin. She already fine.
---
I think most people would rather get a better chance of getting a brawler than getting it instantly.
---
I mean u cant just run into the middle and expect to win,  but his play style is brain dead spam. Real far away just spamming mines that supercell made even easier to hit every patch.
---
Would be a good star skin

Here‚Äôs two.

It's his art

Sucks I can‚Äôt afford them as I bought the sakura spike skin instead
---
#One of the best posts in my opinion nice
---
The minions explode (more like a "pop") when they hit an enemy dealing 360 damage.
---
Ok crow imma explain the joke to you. If you get the token doubler, you find that you get about 35.8974358974 tokens per gem, by dividing 1400 by 39. Then, if you multiply it by 49, the cost of the mega box, you get about 1759 tokens. Thats about 17.59 boxes, which is 7.59 more boxes than a mega box, which is equal to 10 regular boxes. You get about double the chance to get a brawler.
---
Sakura Spike is god
---
Oh ok. I was thinking that she is polish because Jagoda is a polish name ;) I'm polish btw
---
Praise the almighty sakura
---
I dont I will

Now release Undertaker Mortis or Miner Carl and it would be awesome.

I‚Äôm pretty sure by pushing the big robot into the hole in the wall and chaining multiple Bibi supers you can get a much higher dps

Dont worry. I have Crow. Im not no legendary 10k player

You go into friendly and you click piper and pick snappy sniping. Then you go into brawlers and click Leon but when you do click ready as fast as you can. This takes practice but then it is super fun! Hope this helped üòäüòä
---
They won't

I don‚Äôt get this meme, if there‚Äôs 5 you won‚Äôt get a legendary? If it‚Äôs more you might?

I mean u only need to win one more time than before to reach rank 20. Doesn't seem too bad to me

You know 3v3 modes also exist, right?
---
Indeed...
---
Y e s
---
This reminds me of the colt and tara
---
I cant get power points so that means for me 5 star powers or 4 and sandy
---
You stole his post less than a day later you trash heap
---
Not original buddy
---
I'm only in the 500-600 trophy range but always come in top 3 in Takedown. I ignore every power cube and person and just go for the robot. The only time I'll fight a person is of they are being an asshole. Otherwise it's an easy but sometimes frustrating game mode.
---
a mega box for 1.5k star tokens
---
Wow, thats so weird you even drew reddit background and someone elses watermark
---
the bots should attack us when we get in their area
---
Yes,your right
---
 Congrats! You won nothing
---
Every time your friend brags about having all the legendaries while you don‚Äôt remind them that star shelly is something they can never get
---
Looks familiar.
---
I tilted 60 trophies with Piper once... I feel your pain dude
---
I‚Äôd say at least every 8 out of 10 Shellies I verse have Star shelly .‚Äì.
---
He is a fast boy, he heals per enemy hit by his super, is somewhat tanky.  All you need to know is that mortis isnt shelly, bull or primo
---
^^^elllll ^^^primooooo!!!
---
I nineteenth this
---
Spend some money
---
99% of people I verse aren‚Äôt teamers, I haven‚Äôt seen a teamer in at least a month
---
We are dead in that year
---
Play a power one mortis and see how much of a buff he needs
---
How does this have gold whay the fuck
---
Honestly this sounds way better than lone star
---
Just a tiny health buff like maybe 10%
---
2009 for Mortis !!!! Nice meme you made me laugh
---
Let's hope they don't make her available again like they are going to do with the Brawlidays skins
---
Promo
---
yep it is fun and will be a good choice for pushing trophies :)
---
Nice idea, would take alotta coding though so maybe next year
---
You must have been my one updoot
---
Really? I'd say 0.8/10 as maximum
---
This was the bane of my existence until the time I pulled Sandy on 5 items. Turns out I'm super close to maxing out (at the moment I have 2 Brawlers I need points for and then like 30 left on Bibi along with them)
---
I think there should be a feature where you can add a password because my friend‚Äôs son spent 150 gems on a skin he doesn‚Äôt even like rip and he‚Äôs a free player so it‚Äôs worse :(
---
I do too but its quite hard to catch as they would already be near you

Lmao imagine thinking it was about the downvote and not the intention behind the downvote, downvoting because someone has a different opinion. Couldn‚Äôt be me
---
Sandy is the same as mortis, THE SAME, but worse ofc, she has a bit more health but doesnt have movement, her super is team reliant
---
This isn‚Äôt even that rare.. cause often everyone will be attacking the most powerful person f
---
Bro I see people getting that many levels on their bot all the time it‚Äôs still a thing
---
Eai cara
---
His ultimate is op it‚Äôs like Leon‚Äôs but better and sandy is a legendary so must be a bit better
---
Wow, crazy. I haven‚Äôt been playing nearly that long, am at around 7k, and only missing sandy. No money spent
---
Lwarb)
---
Its a serbian name as well but my friend is a dude, not named Jagoda tho
---
Idk maybe it‚Äôs because of the trophies I have ?? But then again they‚Äôre sort of average
---
Talk about healing 4000 and dealing 4000 with mortises super
---
Nevermind it can stack easily
---
Mortis doesnt need a buff
---
Omg another sandy with a spike plush! So cute uwu
---
Is this Alabama?
---
I have +500
---
Or maybe it‚Äôs because of my location
---
How many trophies because lower people won‚Äôt have it as much as higher people. I see them allot and I‚Äôm playing 500+ ppl.
---
I'm sorry I don't speak 9/11
---
Oh ya that makes sense, i thought it was 3 randos and they got matched together
---
wow and I thought this community was better than fortnite toxic community....
---
Oh yeah ur right i had to do a 1 shot pause then I continued totaling up to 6 supers
---
In boss fight of course
---
Like yeah he can do it but by my opinion its waste of gems

It‚Äôs happening now !! :‚Äô(

Poco is bebey &lt;3

I thing you spelled nice wrong

Wdym. Dude. He downvoted my comment because he feels embarrassed about being wrong, even though he knows I‚Äôm right. Why are you defending him? What did I make up in this thread? He is clearly not talking about how he is the one that is  in the wrong here. He pulled he trigger first.

I checked ur comments and u seem like a really negative guy. If u don‚Äôt like the joke then just move a long. There‚Äôs such much better stuff u can do than being mean to people on reddit
---
I lost my account i made before global launch so i don‚Äôt have star shelly bc i had to make a new account when i got my new phone :(
---
At least don‚Äôt give power points to those with a pending upgrade.
---
Also how tf do you make your bubble that pink
---
 That is so cute!
---
He said something like ‚ÄúLike I always say, if you just want to say stuff like that, then get the fuck out you little shit‚Äù
