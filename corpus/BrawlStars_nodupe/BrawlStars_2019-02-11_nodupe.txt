Nice idea!

Although I agree with everything else you said they actually did offer gem offers before switching mortis from epic to mythic

hey, are you from brazil?
---
I think the post was a joke bucko 
---
But I have to collect all the seasonal skins
---
 (&gt;Ôπè&lt;)
---
The only appeal I can see with Mortis is that he is the fastest brawler.
---
Wong place at the wong time...
---
when im tara and have 0 hp left 
---
But its B L U E üîµ
---
Oh crap, I totally forgot. 
---
It is ruining the game
---
Overrated clash royale youtuber. Also does he think he‚Äôs the only person who likes the exclusive skins? I don‚Äôt get it
---
needs star power though otherwise he just gets wrecked. If you watch pro gameplay of max darryl and calculate the full damage there are so many situations where he just dies 
---
OP! Are you planning to beat Insane XVII?
---
I think it shoots dumplings ^‚ÄÜ_‚ÄÜ^
---
Your 174020 person on my list who has made this joke congrats!

*mortis gang*
---
It‚Äôs a preference thing. I think crow is the most fun brawler in the game, but statistically he‚Äôs worse than the other two, and the hardest to play. It‚Äôs up to you. 
---
Very much 
---
OH FFS JUST CUZ ITS A TF2 HAT DOESNT MEAN ITS A TF2 SKIN
---
nice!! now only 470 more chips for crow!
---
Ops the part about my cousin doesn't have to do with anything
---
i got barley global launch cuz i connected to the super cell id
---
Treasure chest Darryl would be cool
---
Why should we check them?
---
LOL 
---
iT dOeSnT eXiSt /s
---
No its not, otherwise i would have every legendary already
---
Me too it‚Äôs taken me so long just to get them up to power 5. I actually enjoy crow a lot but power 5 still really weak. 
---
I said this a long time ago
---
They left because you were playing spike.
---
No it was from the cactus that Spike threw
---
The xbox boi carried me
---
r/gatekeeping
---
Omg just pulled crow too! Back to back boxes! Leon and crow!
---
Plus it'd be easy just make the metal parts of Darryl gold make the metal hoops on the barrel gold and make the metal parts of his shotguns gold along with his feet gold and hands and head and a golden tint to his hat or the skull on his hat 
---
Oof 
---
K
---
I had a Shelly in a bush shooting at the wall while a Jessie just stayed at spawn
---
Brawlers need 2 squares to get through.
---
I would just space things out a bit.
---
Otherwise its unique and interesting
---
Oof
---
The answer is YES
---
yeah, this is true but a lot of times I'm the bad rando so I can't be mad
---
Rune longsword?
---
He is a mythic
---
Yes and colt is jessies brother...
---
Dude he was being sarcastic
---
How?
---
I still cant pass master coz i always got ppl running to boss and dying withen 15 sec..respawn and do the same thing. Had all kinds of brawlers
---
I've literally never been able to find a link to the meme at 0:30 please help
---
Its about surviving not who gets most gems.
---
Yeah I miss that Wild West theme so much and as well as Bo‚Äôs 4 mine. I also hated at the first time invincibility came out for showdown.
---
Super rare pros: He will be easier to obtain
---
Mythic pros: legendaries will statistically be easier to get
---
He cooouuld have scored if supercell wasn‚Äôt stupid enough to add water into brawl ball
---
Do you know what i hate more than teaming. People who dont record the entire game
---
Supercell make this happen
---
The ship deck / yard
---
He's stronger than Leon and probably spike. Pam and Darryl probably have an edge on him though

Big cheese

She‚Äôs pretty good imo. Pretty meh stats but her Super is for sure one of if not the best in the game. She isn‚Äôt doing too well in the meta right now due to assassins like Mortis, Leon, and Darryl being really strong but she can still be used effectively.

Today when I was looking this sub, I saw a lot of cool map ideas that I would like to see on Brawl Stars, but I think that maybe in Brawl Stars there's people that has good ideas but they don't know any map creator so I tried to create a mode were you can create your own maps and share them with the community.
---
Also, making the idea I thought that maybe there should be (if the idea is implemented) like a ranking where the top 1 is added to the game each month or week, such as in Fortnite

Ideas for V2 are very helpful üíô

I though everyone knew it was a tounge

---
Ikr, his long range attack as well as his spread shot if the attack misses, will be very useful in gem grab. Not to mention his ability to grab their gem carrier to turn the tables of the game‚Äôs outcome.

lol, or it‚Äôs just Planet X

---
hey i agree with what u said about teaming! &lt;3
---
I get that it looks like a chameleon's tongue, but what is Supercell trying to make it look like? A hat?
---
They fixed it as a bug in clash royale
---
Only time will tell, but his overall ability to pull opponents and hit from far away will be very useful and good in my opinion.
---
The bug was how it displayed, not it‚Äôs existence I think
---
Sure. Let's say that
---
I have 127 draws which gives me a 27% chance (still very unlikely). Unless you just ran through 300 boxes (which only gives a 52.7% chance), don‚Äôt regret getting those coinsüëçüèº

i got spike and crow before I get Tara

Lol, hes a pro so his account has to be maxed. Also, its P2W as in pay to win.

How do you get those colors for your name?

Umm I thought it was some giant nose for a while

LMAO these names get Wilder everyday

He fricking destroyed that kid with facts. He basically stated that they wouldn‚Äôt be adding it, because it‚Äôs a stupid unneeded feature and pulled off a roast at the same time. This guy should be the CEO of supercell.

Baiting - Easy but risky way to quickly charge your super. Best done against Bull.

Rapid fire -  Fire a regular shot and then instantaneously fire your super. This gives you a lot more damage when you use your super - however, it makes it harder to chain supers.

Same goes for power level. It's completely ridiculous to not earn power points as we play with THAT brawler... ü§∑ Like what's the point. Give us some points for achieving things like X number of kills or X number of game mode wins... SOMETHING. It's just loot box EVERYTHING!!!!

They have probably made it blue , so they don‚Äôt reveal what class he is in , it is most likely to be revealed on the day of his release if he will be a legendary or a mythic as he is in-between the two classes

Can someone give me the original video?

You want to be disappointed now?
---
Nope dude. You're wrong, we saved boxes many times for many brawlers and always worked.
---
And I assure you, it works. When you get a box, the content is decided when you touch, not before.
---
Proof is that, we saved boxes for Leon and he came.  There's video, many youtubers did.

a legendary brawler costs 40 USD. so are you saying that supercell should give us all the brawlers for 40 USD?
---
me OVER NINE THOUSAND
---
Ya dude add "Boner" good player 
---
I had the same game just now but with Jessie and a dynamite :/ this is what happens when you get a new brawler
---
 I somehow got all mythics before 2000. Imma let the odds be in my favor
---
They are testing them on a smaller scale.
---
Max him ! If supercell nerf it, he will be strong again because we can‚Äôt play him anymore in bb so he need to be powerfull on the other mods !
---
Why? 
---
For short: The blue background is the brawlers selection background, not Gene's profile picture
---
Yeah but when you get to 400, you lose. Then you become stuck from 395-400 lol
---
181 trophies isnt much at all...
---
might i add that you are extremely lucky and i am here crying in a corner with no legendary brawlers at 9k trophies
---
I love this
---
That is how probability works. 
---
1 - (1 - p)^n
---
Where n is the number of draws, and p is the probability of success. 
---
127 draws at 0.002496 chance of success, I have around a 27.2% chance of getting Gene.
---
What is the point of this?
---
Same, in our case it doesn‚Äôt matter. The only time it matters is when you have all mythics. Or it should be this way.
---
He got it right gamer
---
It's 1-((1-x)^y), where x = odds of drawing Gene and y = draws. 
---
1-((1-0.0025)^127) = 0.2723, or 27.23%
---
Cuz git gud. But no I have no idea why.
---
How come poco wasnt sans :( 
---
That is true. 
---
1 - 0.99^300 =0.951
---
I, colt , the very being which this soul possesses deems the woman ,who is in relation with me and has raised me up through my life, to be authoritively and imperatively demanded in my presence as soon as possible. 
---
the shade of blue they used does match with a super rare its just that since hes not unlocked, his background is darkened. it is the same for all super rares. though supercell already said that it was a mistake and that he was supposed to have a red background
---
Every time I do that im either a lil too far or a lil too short, and i get angery
---
I got star player not even doing much. I guess it's dmg based or gems?
---
They need to show damage done stats and shit.
---
Gems retrieved or stolen.
---
Landed and missed attacks.
---
I got star player running away as Darryl. No kills. 
---
Yesssss
---
Now she Look Thicc
---
Yeah I started short time ago, but saw some higher players saying it too
---
Only the worst games and the most desperate developers do that
---
1. I feel like a single brawler costing 40 USD is...questionable, at best as is.
---
2. I never said this should be done, but I'm simply proposing the idea. Is it needed? Not really, but I had the idea and wanted to start some discussion for it.
---
high dps and long range. and its boss fight not robo rumble......
---
Lol. Fortnite sucks but, I'd say it's 20% similar. Many games have similar looking shit. 
---
Defiantly 
---
...hm
---
When your teammate has all the 10 gems but still fight near enemy baseüëâüò∂
---
‚ÄúLuck‚Äù to computers is simply a random number generator based on probabilities. Since the probabilities are explicitly stated, it‚Äôs easier for us to figure out the overall probability, given hundreds of draws.

How does one get access to game files?

---
oh wow. i also got bo to 500 yesterday and guess what?
---
I also have 6 brawlers left to go!
---
Yeah, I know! I just wanted to point out that Supercell still didn‚Äôt change it.
---
The other bots kind of represent the brawlers like El Primo and Colt but what the hell is this one?
---
oh ok but this is DEFINITELY not needed. though i would like to ask supercell to GIVE ME MY FRIKKIN LEGENDARY since im sitting at 9k trophies with 0 legendaries
---
Same lol I don't get it. I'm missing

And all 3 legendaries

No other legendary exists. No other true assassin exists.

Hey nice to know that! I am a foreigner studying in Japan. I think it should be written as „Åì„Çì„Å´„Å°„ÅØ. 
---
thats me avoiding doing stuff for school
---
Realy,i have 30 gems,i love darryl.Hhhhhhhmm)
---
You get 100 which is a waste of time. 
---
With some powerlevels he is even more powerful and fun to play :)
---
Sometimes Jessie and nita use their ult only as a shield to lose boss agro 
---
He calculated the probability with the assumption that the rate doesn't change, it's just easier to compute. So what he's really saying is that he has at least a 27% chance of getting Gene. Besides, the percentage increase is pretty negligible to be honest.
---
Should be 600, is this a photoshop?
---
Clash of clans had gem chests, maybe it could be a nice tie in if they used the same model.
---
You lost the previous game

---
No, there is a 400 trophy Poco

There isn‚Äôt a way to report it and there never will be. The Brawl Stars team is way too small to handle reports if they had such a thing. Hopefully they will add something to showdown to prevent teaming though.

Ya he is cuz if u use Leon's super and get close it doesn't that much damage and ud probably die so I suggest using colt  or u could use  Shelly if u want to cuz both of them have supers for damaging and imo its effective against bots
---
That's what I thought too. But when a Frank stuns a Pam, her healing turret is either unable to unload, or is placed before Frank's stun hits her. There has not been a scenario (at least to me) that the healing turret is not placed but the super charge is entirely diminished. I've been playing since Android beta and I've never seen this.
---
Srsly IDK if Dyna is even good in Dat mode or not
---
Invite link though 
---
How did it end tho
---
Well it doesn‚Äôt take a genius to figure out that Primo is terrible on this map. That combined with the high level would explain a lot
---
It really be like that though because sometimes when I see people teaming I kill the person who spins first even if it gets me killed

You are 100% "the bad random" you keep arguing about when you can't gain trophies üòé
---
I don't mean Frank and Pam, I mean if you Shelly super a Frank while he's trying to super. It cancels
---
So it stands to reason that there's a time frame for every brawler in which you can cancel their super if you disrupt them at the right time
---
I've had it happen once as penny before, just how it is
---
Seriously i was enjoying the mortis dashing &amp; Killing everyone.
---
Can get built in clock and battery information built into the game :/
---
Thanks for the clarification I never knew that. So in conclusion, every brawler has a certain time frame for which u can cancel their super from unloading, just that that time frame differs for each brawler. Yes?
---
yup forgot about that one haha, remove both lol

Literally nothing is similar between these two

*Cough cough* Bull...

*Cough cough* Shelly...
---
Thanks buddy.

HD 
---
Supercell can figure that out
---
Agreed
---
To compute the probability for a legendary, I would have to build a model. For Gene, that is not the case because his probability will not be changing, as the luck factor only impacts Legendary Brawlers. Whereas Gene will be classified as a Mythic Brawler.
---
so he is a super rare awesome
---
That's the theory 
---
*Wait, that's illegal*
---
I got Mortis and Tara in a interval of three days :x
---
The coins and Double Token boosts you'll be reaping from *those* boxes ü§§ü§§ü§§
---
F
---
finally, a worthy opponent! our battles will be legendary!
---
I thought it was merged with the ordinary super icon
---
Yip, that enough Maths for one day üòµ
---
It makes people cry?
---
That makes sense.
---
I also was assuming that they were borrowing a little from Leon who is a character from the game "Awesomenauts." 
---
https://awesomenauts.gamepedia.com/Leon_Chameleon
---
He's a chamealon that has a stealth mechanic and attacks with his tougue. 
---
5/58, And a mega box of trophies. I hope to get Gene and Spike / Leon.
---
Like life leach? 
---
I still need all mythics and 2 legends so imma jist open them, gene will come eventually
---
Change your flair already!! üòÇüòÇ
---
tbf most of brawl characters are copies from other games
---
Jessie is just heimerdinger but the E doesnt stun
---
sorry forgot too xd
---
always saw it as a tong
---
Yeah but they took it out. Cuz apparently they love teaming (maybe it‚Äôs the only way the only way devs get wins). 
---
Rly
---
They really need to update Rico's flair
---
You and I are also a random. So yeah you‚Äôre right 
---
thx
---
Wait, that shit happens?!
---
No, it's not bad. Just know how to play the right games and catch the characters that die easy 
---
if Darryl ricochets for a long time, he breaks the wall (I once had it)
---
For one ticket ? This is so valuable 
---
True but it's from a Brawl Box. Free is free and that is my 1st legendary.
---
a white frank guy, a white frank brawler... i got it

What currency is that...?

I got my first at 8.5k with all brawlers maxed. Playing since 15 June 2017
---
I'm not that hyped about it but i still hope to get him. Good luck everyone!
---
It's a friendly battle so there's nothing special about it
---
I liked this remodel, it looks much better than we have today.
---
Gene: not so fast 
---
Nah just to actually see his stats
---
Haha, as soon as I got him, I grinded him up to 500 trophies in 4 days as a lvl 4 with only showdown. Love him so much XD but that was a long time ago now. 
---
I have Mortis and still no epic or legendary

I got my first at 8.5k while not having a mythic then got my second soon after now at 10k
---
So you mean that a f2p player could be able to purchase an endless amount of offers without paying? You realise that Supercell needs money too?
---
We can at least hope his neck isn't broken 
---
It reminds me of the OG Brock, i like it!
---
It's HE and his super hooks people towards him and his main attack is a ball that at a certain distance splits into few small pieces that damage enemies 
---
Yeah
---
Russians be like: STRAIGHT PEOPLE SHIPS ONLY. *NO GAY *
---
Une note, donc il veut dire un 20/20 ^^
---
The offer will be gone at the same time as Gene will be released.
---
I see that you aren't that active here, this has been noticed and posted about 3 billion times...
---
Why is Showdown lame AF?
---
How about getting 7th with 3 kills. That‚Äôs drives me even more crazy 
---
The fuck is a Bal
---
Yep i know
---
Lol gj yam
---
You can feel the dread in the way that primo stopped moving.
---
If it was unintentionally coordinated, then it is fine
---
EEEELLLLLLL PRIIIIMMMOOOOOOO
---
Nice! All this talk really makes me hope for a legendary. Or at least a mythic. Cmon Supercell be nice. 
---
Good catch, didn‚Äôt notice that! I like what supercell is doing with these countdowns for new content.
---
And you posted this why?
---
Why? Do you think he will be bad when he comes out?
---
Lol why hate
---
I figured a bunch of ppl may wanna see someone beating insane so I posted it
---
Didn't see it the reddit is flooded with low quality meme's.
---
Regarding the offer my lunar offer ends after four days and a few hours gene is getting released in three days and a few hours. So that gives me an extra day on the deal. 
---
Yes, that‚Äôs a common trouble. Frank isn‚Äôt as strong as it seems, especially at 300+, where people learn how to counter him properly. First of all, let‚Äôs talk where you can use him. You can use it in BB, SD and certain gem grab maps, definetly avoid Heist and Bounty. In BB he is one of the best, of course there are some maps that aren‚Äôt good for him, but most of them are viable. SD nightmare, Frank‚Äôs teams (you thought dyna‚Äôs teams were cancerous? Well, say hi to the 300+ meta)-&gt; basically in certain maps frank is used a lot, especially because a frank will team up with an other frank, they‚Äôll charge each other supers by hitting them self, and then they‚Äôll destroy everything. Of course this team works just on certain maps-&gt; Rockwall Brawl is the best one, you and your frank team will mostly stay in the middle, sometimes you‚Äôll hide in bushes to stun who‚Äôs walking behind the wall near you (at 400+ you may even find 7+ franks in this map). Feast or famine is a really good one too (not already at 300, probably more at 380). This time, you and your frank team will probably end team up with some other random brawlers too and you‚Äôll stay outside, not in the middle (this is the biggest difference from rockwall brawl). You‚Äôll basically spend most of your time to build up your super and use them to destroy the center walls and bushes, putting the one who survived the center under a big pressure (he is probably going to be an el primo, bull or shelly), making it hard for him to survive if he hasn‚Äôt a super to stop you. 
---
Gem grab: he can be a good aggro just in certain Gem Grab map, basically he‚Äôll spend his time killing and stunning people (of course don‚Äôt use him with Randoms, avoid playing with randoms in general. You should organize a good team combo first). Probably the best map for Gem Grab for Frank at 300+ is hard rock mine (or at least that‚Äôs the only place where i used him in GG, he is probably good in some other maps too, but he is especially good there). If you want to use him in that map, you‚Äôll have to go on the left at the start of the match to go on the enemy side, and basically you‚Äôll stay there as long as possible, while trying to kill and stun everyone. Pay attention not to break the small walls and bushes in the enemy side line, as those will be your biggest protection. His star power can be really
---
Helpful to kill those who respawn too. I think this is everything I can say to you about maps, you‚Äôll have to get used to his range.Also  pay attention to bull el primo and darryl who destroys you (darryl can wait and use his ulti on you, almost unbeatable if he has his super, even if you use your super). El primo and bull will have an harder time to get close to you, but they‚Äôll destroy you without problems too, especially if they have charged their super

Oraoraoraoraoraoraora!!!!!
---
Thats because you havent got past 350, everyone knows how to counter leon at that point and its not that op nor easy
---
I see now thank you mate

how about just showing the profiles for a longer time?! why would you post a video where everyone has to pause it 5-6 times to see anything?

Yes, but if you look at other locked brawlers, they‚Äôre background color matches their rarity. It‚Äôs possible they decreased his rarity, or this could mean nothingü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Oh cool, thanks!
---
No, this background is a different shade of "blue" than the Super Rares. He is mythic.
---
What‚Äôs so hard? It‚Äôs only normal difficulty
---
All brawlers above 500 get half their trophies taken away. For example, a 550 Pam would go down to 525. It's bittersweet, because you're able to push even higher the next season, and I like the practise.
---
A very quick story
---
Me: Mighry Tara, which brawler will I get in the next box
---
Tara: *shows me the cards*
---
Me: Oh no, there is nothing...
---
Me: *gets Leon*
---
Me: yayyyy
---
P.S. This is not real. I don't have Leon.

Is this a sarcasm?

Check out ky guns, haha! ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)

The spike isn't tall enough to get shot by the colt.. bull is going down. At least i won't get killed because I walked into a bush and there was a bull in it

---
I took many cards as a basis. There should not be so many boxes. For example, if there are many boxes in the center, there will not be many at the edges, and vice versa, it depends on how the random will work. I tried to make a map for everyone, so here are a few bushes.
---
Thanks for the feedback.

They're gonna make it 150 fucking gems tho.

Go ahead bro

Thanks!

And how is that gonna work for in-game?

Yea I have friended people before who are very good players with no Club and no way to invite other than to try to get them to party up and then ask them to join Discord.  Simple in-game feature needs to be added.

he's a mythic

Yahhh

No! I mean there's a special offer with Leon for 5 $ and not for 600 gems

She wanted to be like Rico

Gene is a super rare not mythic
---
Yaaaaaah

Am i the only one to immediately check every other brawler if it will have a skin as well?

Unlucky

Thank you! However they have already created the place for a fifth skin!üëç

High HP, high damage, and heals.

I play less than that. I'm only 1500 rating and I already have 18/22 characters. I'm only missing the cactus, the crow, bo, and mike
---
Lol nice
---
So satisfying...
---
Everything is better when there's more effort put into it, all im saying is that he could he could easily atlest put a 1gem icon over the treasure and a 10gems icon over indiana's head
---
It really is like people saying mortis is so op now but he still gets rekt by all those tanks and shellys because noone plays anything other that those brawlers....and its annoying
---
Does the season reset affect your overall trophies ?
---
2400 is nothing I got to 5000 and didn't have any legendaries or Tara (been playing since day 1 on and off)
---
Another poison-type mechanic would be cool! Maybe the star power would add some random variation of direction to the first attack after being hit.

you would say OP

That's basically pam

Yes. The rewards are transferred to your account right when you purchase them. The actual opening is just a visual. Everything is done before then
---
I feel like I might know.

You can make the argument for teaming in any scenario then lol. It will always benefit teaming (in terms of increasing your odds of getting 1st) vs playing an actual showdown solo.

this is Hot Maze 3.0

He‚Äôs very useable if you use him right. I got mine to 400 at level 3 and 500 at level 6. Just practice and it‚Äôll click. 
---
What? 
---
Wow, An actual Original joke, I congratulate you 
---
Thanks! She's a pirate after all XD
---
No, it's 600 for 19 gems
---
It literally gets rid of more skill if they just had auto do everything for you.. If you panic and try to run with mortis with auto or miss-aim and hit a wall, then you deserve to lose. 
---
Not mortis or Darryl?Frank?Lol
---
Yeah I know but I never say what leons isnt a reference to a chamaleon, in fact chameleon in spanish is "camale√≥n"

---
&gt; Let‚Äôs not ruin his/hers comment section with childish comments. 
---
Okay, thats fine. Good.
---
Also, i dont think asking someone "whats the need of putting your age in someone's artwork" is negative, considering afterwards i said the kiddo's art was good. But you made the environment hostile, which lead to you getting scolded by me and argueing on this section when, again, you said it yourself you tried to not ruin it with childish comments. Yeh okay
---
Wow i'm talking dirty all the time i should stop
---
they should remove auto aim because some brawlers are op thanks to it some can't use it.  it's unbalanced

She looked so ugly before

Same, yesterday

Whenever i try this as mortis the bull would start shooting me as well lol

Mortis kills Crow: Now have chicken in the menu!

This subreddit disagrees

That‚Äôs the point. I don‚Äôt think teaming is ever bad. It‚Äôs only bad when your the one getting teamed up on

29 gems for a mega box. 1000 key doublers is 10 boxes (mega)

This subreddit is wrong lol. I climbed crow to 400 at level 3 and 500 at level 6 easily. People just don‚Äôt play him right.
---
*thats something a crow would say*
---
r/SubscribeToPewdipie
---
Lmao
---
insane
---
Unplayable...
---
are you kidding me? if we had tap to aim i would agree with you but the new controls are fucking awful. Many times i swiped from left to right only to have mortis dash up for no reason. Happened many times while escaping from bulls and shellys, swiped too fast and the game didn't recognize the control and made me dash into them instead of away from them, even tho i had clearly swiped away. It's supercell's fault for wanting to make a mobile game because it comes with all the flaws mobile devices have, they least they could do is design the game to make up for these flaws. If could i control them with a mouse i wouldn't be this mad. 
---
Edit:please note the skin cost more than half of the actual brawler
---
Karen : takes the kids
---
Even for 50 gems it is worth it...
---
not populer opinion but mortis without the hat betterüòÖ
---
PaM iS oP
---
Yeah, I have it too, right after I spent my 30 gems on tickets :(
---
Lmao at first I thought he was gonna kill me but my man was so kind  he sticked together with me till the end
---
If they kill the others they get 2nd, which is really close to 1st and you get one less trophy only
---
this isint a bug, this isint matchmaking, this is someone thats p2w, its not a big deal because you can get your brawlers to lvl 7 very easily. 
---
Leon is not still balanced.
---
When the guy who cheats off of you gets a better grade than you on the test.
---
Welcome bro 
---
Thats cuz you dont know how to play him
---
r/woooosh
---
Dont ask......i was always spawned near bulls, shellys, darryls
---
They wont come back. They are limited edition. 
---
Use bull then...
---
I just clicked on this reddit 3hours ago, and I just kept going between different Reddits and just realized it started from here 
---
üòÇ
---
I think it would be better that the super, instead of making people waste autoattacks, just get slowed by a huge amount while walking away (they cant autoattack nor freely move until the end of the duration). Something like how [Fear](https://youtu.be/Rro20bR4jnQ?t=186) works in League of Legends.
---
Also, to avoid frustration from players battling against him, how bout it has a limited amount of ticks that increase their damage over time? I imagined that since Ayzan has low damage, he had a really high amount of ticks before the effect wore off. Which is something that, again, may frustrate some players that do not have any healing sources in their team. I mean like this:
---
Total amount of ticks: 5 (counting the initial shot)
---
Each tick will increase its damage A 2% 
---
Example: 
---
First instance of damage: 280
---
1st tick: 285
---
2nd tick: 291
---
3rd tick: 297 
---
4th tick: 303 
---
5th tick: 310 
---
Total damage: 1795.
---
Or if 5 ticks is way too frustrating, either buff the attack damage a bit more and reduce the ticks to 3. Can work either way lol
---
Yes because the over all trophies are the sum from all Brawler trophies. 
---
Really? Like never? It's sad, but thanks
---
BEAR WITNESS TO MY FITNESS!

Balancing is also probably one of their concerns. 
---
I've had it a few times, usually works when I click two at the same time.
---
We're not saying she's deadly (unless up close then she is)
---
She's just hard to kill and dodge

bull ist a good damage dealer and he can run away fairly easy with his super. i think he is accutaly a good choice for boss fight and him getting the cubes makes sense
---
It seemed to get better for me after the update
---
Leon is Zuckerberg.
---
If only I could get one lol.  Anyone else having troubles as free to play players?
---
I noticed this first...

A lot of Star Powers are just sad, like Piper and Poco. It really doesn't add much of an extra aspect to gameplay, nothing like Dyna-Jump or Fertilise.
---
Or 1 mega box - 15 boxes x (-2) boxes
---
It be like that sometimes
---
whats wrong? most people have long arms 
---
Idk dude, you basically told me to ¬®have better comebacks¬® so i just re-read the whole conversation and summed what happened and my point of view. If you think thats bullshit, thats your problem. But notice, that i was pretty tolerant when writing that paragraph lol

It is my hope that spinners will get early onset finger arthritis.

Just to mention that it's not the overall size of a cured polymer clay item that matters for its brittleness and easy breakability, but whether any areas are *thin* or *projecting* enough.  
---
Cured polymer clay items that are small or even teeny will be quite strong as long as they're thick-and-rounded *including* the lines mentioned above that would be brittle if thin or projecting.  But most all the other brands/lines of polymer clay will also be strong in thin areas.  (This is all presuming that the clay has been thoroughly polymerized during curing, which is a different factor.) 
---
I thought that only applies for legendaries.
---
Subtle flex of the crow skin 
---
Yeah I killed you with Mike

Bwahahahahahahhahahahahahhaha

It seems weird to have more mythics than rares

Man i never get brawlers i'll try to do that 
---
They changed the maps 
---
Nothing I love that cutie ü§ó I wish I had him, but I think he needs just a sliiiiiiiiiight nerf just a tiny tiny nerf üòä
---
Good idea, but the map is too empty... wayyyy too empty
---
Since you have a decimal as the base of your exponent, your exponents will keep on going down and down towards 0. But, since the only way you can get a 0 is by multiplying by 0, and that isn‚Äôt part of our exponent, there will never be a 100% chance to get the brawler. Is that what you were asking?

that's what i call toxic players. Glad he killed u
---
It's like taking a healing potion or taking a health regeneration potion. 
---
Agree to disagree, there are plenty of mobile games that have ported to switch and done very, very well. 
---
Just because they port to the switch won‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre taking away from enhancing the current game btw. 
---
YO IM IN CHARGE
---
yes it is
---
Pop pop pop
---
which also makes it bad for some brawlers
---
When you see 4 dynamikes spinning 
---
Me too
---
noo
---
Thank
---
I spin with them and hope they don't notice me lining them up for the take down. 
---
I‚Äôd say he‚Äôs definitely worse then most of the brawlers, not just legendaries. He just doesn‚Äôt do a lot of damage and has a very small amount of health. His poison is really his only redeeming quality because it prevents enemies from healing but his damage output is just ass. Like getting two shot by Piper and Brock is pretty fucking wack considering it takes like a million shots to take them out.
---
Haha true, it can be hard to tell.
---
Poor rabbit üò™üò¢
---
i love it when people draw Phoenix Crow
---
This is beyond amazing

Very well made!

Nothing to see here, just us cacti

IM SO PROUD OF THIS COMMUNITY

Neither have I

Yes I see its terrible...

Wow that grammar is bad

Because for one trophy difference it's not always worth the struggle. I do this all the time. Especially if the fog is far off. I don't want to wait two more minutes for me and the bush camping Bull to find out who the obvious winner will be. Save yourself the time collect your winnings and start again. 
---
But! I am already Tracer

Ben Shapiro would be proud

i have 100 boxes... welp TIME TO DIE

Theres a leon in every box but you can't see him
---
Actually in the way crow is right now if he goes of cover does 3 quick attack and hide back he gets so little value. Because the damage of the poison will no increase and will not extend.. so to do more damage. You have to do an attack with some seconds of diference of the other to the poison get more value. However brawl stars is a quick game with quick matches. The crow gameplay doens't really fit. Best mode for playing him right now is showdown and you have to be super careful and be a master of dodging enemy fire. Because 2 attack os lots of brawler can take you down.
---
Exactly, they have the player base to need the feature and the money to do it. They also have this feature in other games so the backend would be copy paste and maybe add some brawl stars specific logic. Then just add the front end to the game.
---
That has been one of my gripes..pairing up the teams more evenly would be nice..it is a hit or miss.
---
There will always be a meta. If you see a pattern, you can always counter it. A ranged brawler with high damage will keep pesky tanks at bay.
---
they change it so it is one of the considerations, but not the ONLY consideration.
---
I think brawler trophies is still the main factor.
---
I'm Krolito xD

Love it when this happens! Hopefully they never patch it üòÇ

was that rly pcats as bull

mortis gang with the bois
---
No. I don't like his play style. 
---
Slightly lagging makes it impossible 
---
they're above 400
---
Very cool!
---
What?? How is it possible to be that unlucky...i feel your pain man, and there are so many noobs at like 500 trophies who have a legendary...so unfair...
---
Totally agree. Game has been out to long now not to fix
---
Ima join
---
Do you think the Lunar Pack was unfair to those who spent all their money in the Level 50 Pack? I mean, both had the same price and the Lunar Pack was strictly superior to the L50 Pack. Discounts are never unfair, if you buy stuff for normal price, it means you have enough money to not wait for a better deal, you are paying to not wait.
---
At this moment, the majority of players who not purchased the Lunar Skins are either patient players or players who don't care about skins or poor players. I think all them should be rewarded with better deals.
---
At that point I also had none of them. Got 3 epics and Tara recently, after 6k (6.8k right now). 
---
Good luck, bro. I feel your pain.
---
You can search for it online or YouTube 
---
I was thinking that the lunar year happen just once
---
Gotcha thank y‚Äôall 
---
It‚Äôs kinda wasted if you spend money on pp, as it‚Äôs about 2coins for a single pp. it‚Äôs a waste of money especially if you are f2p, if you are p2w you can ignore everything
---
was joking 
---
Bull is one of the best brawler for boss fight. 
---
What you ran into is just a bad bull. It's not the brawler, its the player.
---
Juicy AF
---
I didn‚Äôt know :/
---
There were 4 dynamikes teaming with each other, spinning all over the place, tried to recruit me too but that‚Äôs just not my thing. Only 3 left here cause I‚Äôm guessing Leon killed one before he died 
---
Awesome bro!
---
I think its colt
---
Why did I think the gas clouds were moving? üòÇ
---
I'm almost 3000 trophies without spending money and I only have 2 legendarys to get and the unreleased card
---
This aint my first rodeo
---
Piper winks
---
Did Rico get thin again? 
---
Boi
---
This is revolutionary. 
---
Yes, checked his profile and he's President of his club called "phonecats" with lowercase p. Currently he's at 10.4k trophies and his band is 185th global if you want to see.
---
Rico 10 work? 
---
gg
---
20
---
I don't think you understood, the attack and super icons at√© at the game files.
---
A more subtle nerf is in order. I do think that the lack of anticipation in certain situations suck and is questionable what logic justifies an invisible brawler but that's just the case with new abilities I guess.
---
soon
---
What‚Äôs his new Super
---
What are you playing on? Why is it so grainy 
---
U have spike at 1.9k.... 
---
me jealous 
---
I think every one knows that its kind of a act we do when we are full of gem
---
what does the title mean?
---
Yea I do, although I still remember finding legendary elixir...
---
Oh thank you! I tried to give throwers a big advantage, since you don‚Äôt see many in Showdown, but I still tried to make it balanced between each class :)
---
Spike before 2k, don't be jealous
---
It‚Äôs funny how he drew Phoenix crow because it looks way better
---
what about star powers?
---
Haaaahha
---
Following
---
yup.
---
I have 16 saved and one big box
---
Your good bro
---
yes 
---
Soo true
---
I really don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs that bad anymore. I‚Äôd rather have Pam nerfed personally. 
---
Is there any reason you aren't able to print screen?
---
The difference of 40‚ÑÖ is because of Life, Attack, and Super stats.
---
Star Powers are like, extras, it doesn't have a exact porcentage of difference.
---
But probably 10‚ÑÖ too or less.
---
No . It just dodge using your movement...
---
They aren‚Äôt even the same brawlers lol
---
Don‚Äôt forget Spike and Pam. 
---
Yeah. Only have one Epic, no Mythics or Legendarys
---
7 Colt here.

115 boxes and 11 big boxes. Missing Leon and Gene, hope to get at least one. 
---
Meh
---
I know, but some of them give a massive advantage over brawlers who don't have them
---
Or Minecraft Survival Games 
---
Your right bro
---
lol 
---
Well Phoenix crow is cool for sure... but worth it? Nah too expensive
---
If you think brawl stars is the best Battle Royale game, ur dumb. Some games are waaaay better (like pubg even though I don't play it). Stop sucking off supercell
---
The thing that hard to dodge are those things he shhots and if you lose any health its even worse
---
BrawlStars ghosting. ü§∑ü§¶
---
I bought the Lunar Pack to get gems to buy skins. Also, I have no Legendary or Mythic Brawlers, so I'm not in a hurry to get Gene.
---
Thanks for linking my post :)
---
Keep fat fingering my big boxes :)
---
Darryl Gang
---
Which brawler you were playing?
---
Not really that massive. And Star Powers also aren't hard to get, almost the same chance than getting a Super-Rare brawler, which is not hard.
---
I drew it :P
---
It took a long time. But after a while I suddenly got Piper and Leon back to back.
---
Which ones do y'all disagree with? 
---
Yeah it should‚Äôve been pubg since that was the one that started the trend.
---
Piper's star power is reeeally good but it got nerfed harshly when they removed bushes's respawning, and even more now that there are a ton of brawlers that can destroy bushes.
---
Thanks
---
first of all this is a repost and secondly click the three dots in the cornerand click choose user flair
---
Thanks for letting me know!
---
why is he trying to eat the rocket?
---
It‚Äôs good because you get so much things to open little box and if you dont have a legandarie your chance go up every time you open a box
