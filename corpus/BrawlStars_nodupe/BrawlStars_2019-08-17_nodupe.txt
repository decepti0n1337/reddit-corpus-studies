Thx.

Less memes, higher quality content posts

This looks soo cool! Nice job.

It would actually maybe make more sense, as the map would open up fairly quickly (hopefully) and then the map would be shaped by which grass you destroy

There should be a specific time each week where people can make suggestions for new Brawlers/Skins/balance changes etc....

Not sure if possible but it would be nice to be add  media in comments.

Oooo when did they change Spike‚Äôs description before removing them? During western theme it was ‚ÄúThis strange desert dweller is the last of his kind. Or is he...?‚Äù
---
OJF broken

which then hinted it may not be true iirc. But yeah his family‚Äôs probably dead or something if they don‚Äôt pull a po when supercell gets back to doing the lore

Can someone give me the blank template of this

To be honest the hog rider Carl giveaway was better than this
---
Jimmy for the last time you cant use hacks in brawl stars
---
More posts about strategy, especially for boss fight.
---
Gonna be honest it‚Äôs not bad but the fact that it‚Äôs black and white confused me as of what it is when I saw this meme
---
Dude no. If piper was slowwwwly going acrosd the air, people could just run up. If she moved to the spot fast, they cant catch up
---
Ima also TRY to make one and post it on r/Brawlstars if it get 25 upvotes
---
This ad you made is epic
---
Maybe a weekly or monthly competition for best post / meme / play etc. where the winner is awarded a special flair
---
r/Brawlstars press 3 dots in top right corner and press change user flair
---
Lol
---
Yes please
---
Cursed

Yep. I give up.
---
Ah yes. Enslaved copypastas.

Supercell: I'm about to take down this whole company's career

No wonder that sub is basically cursed images

thanks, i guess ;w;

oh no

I‚Äôm really sorry life has not been the best for you at the moment, but everything gets better in the end! Know that people are here to support you and love you! If you want to talk about whatever it is, please feel free to
---
what-
---
Actually use some of the amazing ideas from this subreddit
---
How do you have the brawler beside your profile name
---
How do you have mortis or any brawler beside your name
---
USING THE ENERGY BOOST TO SPIN
---
Its a app/website
---
She's good on beachcombers though, but to be fair every brawler is good on beachcombers
---
Oops uh..
---
you have to buy a skin
---
just happens in the star points shop
---
lmao very good
---
I don't know, I think supercell is really trying hard to distant brawl stars from the "Western theme" in my opinion but I do agree they should do more wild west stuff
---
Its darryl's hat and there is also leon ninja star behind there
---
Sir but I think you jumped in the wrong direction at the end
---
We're in the endgame now
---
Hmm, there aren't enough pathways at mid and throwers would be overused on this map, spawntrapping would also be way to easy to accomplish.
---
Year
---
"moranguin"
---
I read that as "retarded miner" *face palms own face*
---
An area to suggest changes, report people (or just add a report button in game) and show bugs would be helpful and nice.
---
Literally got Crow today
---
Should be piper but at least you got the point
---
Thanks for the great content you guys gave when you were on holiday!
---
Agreed!
---
Except this is a way less epic endgame lol
---
Gene
---
Pretty big imo. I don't understand how people expect this to be a new brawl talk or an update hint
---
Ok I will comment there next
---
Do they even realise that it is a community based announcement?
---
Yeah I should have given up the gems hahaha
---
Why would you do that, kid?
---
First, go to the Brawl Star subreddit, then click on the three dots on the top right corner and click change user flair, then choose which Brawler you want to have beside your name.
---
The tag was "Humor", kid.
---
I‚Äôm not. I‚Äôm feeling like trash
---
Frank said that it was a Reddit announcement.
---
Happy cake day and F
---
I never met a shelly that wasted my super but tons of teamate bibi wasting my super (cus those randoms player always kncokback them when i try to use my super)
---
Then what‚Äôs the timer that doesn‚Äôt go down for
---
Ni√±o, no seas idiota, pedazo de mierda. No puedes publicar en espa√±ol, est√∫pido.
---
We should have dynamite control.  Then have everyone register their assault dynamite.
---
It would be cool if the developers could leave sort of mark on a post that would say that they are interested in the post. 
---
So let's say you guys see a new skin idea pop up in hot and it's the best skin idea ever to Grace Brawlstars subreddit. It would be really cool if the developers could add a flair, that says, "This idea is great and we might take it into consideration in the next update." 
---
We, as a community, I feel doesn't get much feedback from the developers about our ideas. Some ideas that we like, and want added to the game could be something that supercell will never add to the game. So in all, more communication from team SuperCell would be great.

Hi Spike‚Äôs family, Friends, cousins, uncles, aunts, grandpa, grandma, girlfriends, boyfriends, siblings, babies, school janitors, principal, nice to meet u!

Change the upvote and downvote buttons to something like colt smiling and a colt crying.
---
No u
---
Relatable.
---
No wonder everyone attacking them teamers demise
---
Yeah I was confused too. Behind Star Shelly it days Colt lol. Good quality assurance these guys have.
---
I am still waiting for my starpowerm.. been two months
---
Leon picks one up

Which one?

Tbh if you look behind bandita Shelly at the card, it's written Colt.

Solo teaming = no life

Duo teaming = how do you sleep at night

this subreddit is great already, if there was some bot moderator which could moderate the posts to avoid bad posts/reposts (like r/memes or r/funny) this subreddit could be much better!

Have more informational posts from moderators. Also more giveaways!!!
---
Stonks
---
This is the funniest meme I‚Äôve seen all day
---
Oh right
---
No

More accurately title posts, this isn‚Äôt the big announcement I was expecting. Maybe making memes a separate subreddit

Add more exciting features like promoting a post or something similar to that

Is dynamike trying to Dyna-jump down there? He had ton of stress?

Pretty sure you're misusing it.

Swastika is how its spelled

Maybe call it tom and jerry? Btw nice map i like it

My suggestion is to have less memes in the subreddit, I know the game is somewhat shallow but it would be way more enjoyable to have something like league of legends subreddit
---
Love it
---
I think we should control the amount of memes in this sub. and make it more related to the game. any maybe some tips from pros.
---
Nice a new mode
---
so cool
---
Super Rare edition:
---
Rico: 
---
Teammate: Dies 1 second after the game starts
---
Enemy: Keeps spamming super and always wipes out your team
---
Darryl:
---
Teammate: Rolls and hits a cactus and ended up in the exact same spot as before
---
Enemy: Is a rolling assassin
---
Penny:
---
Teammate: Puts cannon in the middle of the map thinking she has Last Blast
---
Enemy: Last Blast wipes out your whole team
---
Carl:
---
Teammate: Keeps spamming his pickaxe at the walls
---
Enemy: Somehow always hits you twice with his pickaxe
---
TOUGH AS NAILS, HARD AS A ROCK

#CREEPER

Hol up

Imagine Darryl just using his super on the water he can travel really far
---
A weekly/seasonal post where players can submit their best plays and/or funny High/Low IQ plays. The winner would be rewarded somehow in the subreddit and or (if possible) in game with gems or featuring in the news tab.
---
pop a brand deal with microsoft? sound amazing ngl

Removed. Rule 3. No providing information on how to break Supercell Terms of Service.

---
Go to the r/brawlstars subreddit, press on the 3 dots on the top right corner, then select change user flair. Then pick what brawler you want to be!
---
If he was over a wall or body of water when the super deactivates does he go to the closest solid ground or the one he was at last
---
I honestly think the best thing this subreddit could offer is a weekly or monthly map making contest that integrates the maps that win
---
Mean while spike‚Äôs enjoying to be in the top.
---
Speaking of which, I wish there was like a special token on beta player profiles, similarly to how there's the "played for X years" token in Clash Royale
---
Hehe my comment about the downvoting made it to the top im so proud
---
No shit
---
Oh, sorry, i forget. Yes, when you have super, you start play more aggressively and it's so funny to jump on enemies with low health.
---
Lol this is amazing, if i dont see cory reacting to this im disappointed in this sub
---
f
---
i saw
---
If all the shots landed on him it would have been a one shot kill or very close.
---
Even summer Piper is better
---
More communication with the brawlstars team and the community! For example, creating a simple site to upload skin ideas, brawler ideas just like maps!
---
The difference is-
---
Nothing but the colours
---
jAjaJAjA

Very 3D looking, I like it :)

it's only bs related if the text with the format it related to bs. the format can be literally anything, no one cares. but the text is what matters.

You are the kindest person ever. I salute you :)

Nah it's bad. Playing brawl stars on blue stacks is like u playing brawl stars drunk

#OK?? 
---
Now get out of here before i help you too.
---
(SPINS FAR AWAY)
---
Yeah the darryl speed suddenly sped up
---
No. I'm not a former number 1, I'm just saying that it's much easier to 1v3 in a 3v3 mode especially when there is a ton of the gems on the ground because the enemies will get greedy for them. I'm not saying 1v3 is easy, I'm just saying that it's not difficult.
---
Wow 4 brawlers in 1 box!
---
Give it  a try
---
It would be impossible without the power advantage because of less damage and health
---
Then you can tell me if it is good or not
---
*Joins laughing in being pretty mediocre*
---
Nobody.
---
Suggestion. Organize a bi monthly contest where a skin design made by the community is put under spotlight by supercell to be added on a list of skins that supercell could eventually apply in the game.
---
Without starpower* but he has his starpower in this clip and that's why he survived
---
Nobody... yet.
---
This is literally Snappy Sniping On Gene But Its Awesome
---
Woah
---
Great idea
---
I made a fan made story for Leon - This ninja was soon to be a leader for a long clan but he knew he could be more. So he left his village to brawl

Il problema √® la grossa presenza di Shelly?

Perch√© personalmente penso che la gente la usi parecchio in questa versione per mettere una pezza al dominio di Nita, che da Super Brawler √© decisamente troppo forte

It's a glitch. Go to help and see if there's anything helpful (tho probs not cuz bs help is not interactive like cr)

No matter what comes through that gate. We will stop them.

Let me know which of these star power ideas is your favorite! Personally, mine is Rico‚Äôs because imagine the chaos that would ensue from it üòÇ. All the star power icons were drawn on my computer, so I hope they look convincing. Also, the stats I came up with for the star powers are far from perfect and if these ideas ever made it in-game (that‚Äôs a big IF), the stats would not be the same as the ones I created. Last thing, if you read this far, have a cookie. Just cuz.

Thats your wifi my guy, thats defo not supercell‚Äôs fault xD

Flair Checks

#STONKS

The cutest brawler in Brawl Stars

the only valuable I have is star power on Bo which I bought in 2000....

Spike. What did you do???
---
#NICE

(I don‚Äôt even remember what this thread is about)
---
Yeah, try to play Brawler like Piper and you'll see
---
Shellies protecting the king.
---
not really, 400 isnt really low... specific brawler trophies might not matter either, with my crow at 100 trophies that I just got, im still facing ppl at 10k, just w lower lv brawlers
---
You know, you can complain about 69 memes by going to r/memes .
---
They are not attacking. That's a way to ruin your teammate's game
---
I haven‚Äôt ever said such a thing, if I deleted the comment it would still be visible
---
i will keep it like that :)
---
Devil? 69 is life!
---
open boxes
---
I have 3 maxed out brawlers but only have 1 star power
---
I know my name is MoreOfMortis but I think I i should change It to MoreOfPenny
---
NO I DISAGREE NO THANK YOU
---
#*whatever*
---
Staying in the bushes without attacking is not a strategy.
---
I want to return my Tara instead of my legendary drop rates plz
---
It's the old season! Now we have the: StOpPlAyInGbRaWlStArS

It doesnt increase difficulty, it just makes the games last longer...

Everybody knows that

#what?

#neither are you
---
Who know Gene played as a slayer player in Splatoon
---
Sad they also just realised the star power for my boi primo but why now why not on the first day..
---
I agree with ya

i got a total of 18 coins and 13 power points

Very nice! Not shaking though

With a mega box, chances are you would get 300 coins and a bunch of other stuff...
---
There is going to be that one person who wishes they are sakura spike. Eek
---
Fake check my profile and see
---
Hahahhahaahah
---
With a mega box, chances are you would get 300 coins and a bunch of other stuff... mega boxes are way better imo, plus pretty sure he wasnt complaining..
---
Good luck on these Copypasta members
---
NICE !

I made my nita at 707 trophies in side Story with hyper bear

Beside this idea, They should also make skin icons for profiles, so that players can customize their accounts much better.

Can't believe HTTYD 3 meme format is dead.

%1 chance from each regular box

No,69 power cubes

These are actually pretty good. Some are overpowered (Frank/Bull/Gene) but I think with a few balancing the rest can actually be in the game
---

Thx man :) I‚Äôm bad with stats and stuff like that
---
Hi! I think this subreddit needs to have more gameplay videos and less memes (I don't have anything against memes, but it is too much).
---
Read the rules of use
---
Im bat at statistics
---
This brings tears to my eyes.
---
easy einough, don't waste your gold
---
why ?
---
I was actually expecting something more
---
So if I saved some many boxes can I get it?
---
hahahaha it‚Äôs the sex number! how original and funny!
---
Yeah, if you want gene
---
I‚Äôd love a megathread about brawlers, star powers and concepts for new characters.
---
Yes, 2nd biggest earthquake in this community. 1st was made by a post named Hol Up, namely a "shocking" magnitude of 11. And it was a art stealer who posted the post.
---
That star shelly
---
for me it took 2 weeks. at the end of 2 weeks i used token doubler in robo rumble and opened like 30 boxes
---
no
---
Too late used all of my gold on el  primo nita  gene Tara pam. So I will try to save my gold next time
---
I think they should make it so new star powers would appear more in shops for maxed players.
---
How do u pick
---
This is dark.

Penny icon looks like she bribes her enemy to win. Good job though!

It looks like a painting I would find at the local Chinese restaurant of the owner‚Äôs kid.

Ur really talented at names and thinking out ideas!
---
You are clearly unluckier
---
Yeah,but when I'm  big Jessie they're all shellies who chain-super me and throwers
---
Tick needs a rework, not a removal. That's a drastic decision.
---
It looks great, but immagine be a throwable brawler in the middle and just blocking everyone trying to take the jump
---
**Balls of fire**
---
No you cant even walk to the middle
---
The thing is you have to be good enough to land the shots for it to be effective, but I see your point. Thx for the feedback :)
---
The title should‚Äôve been : NITAAAAA
---
I use the OnePlus 7 Pro.
---
Many BS youtubers use the IPhone XS Max
---
Or the razer phone.
---
Also a few of the spawns leave you stuck on a 1x1 or 1x2 island. This map needs a COMPLETE 100% redo.
---
Thx man :)

Max items to get in a box is 7-8.But if its real then congrats :)

You just talked tird person about yourself
---
Turntables have 630¬∞
---
I've never seen a brawler become so strong just by having their range increased. No wonder supercell were afraid of actually buffing mortis
---
Bro in some situation we have to take it, like enemy gonna take it before your teammate spawn
---
#Now you can‚Äôt be in my Minecraft thumbnail!

How to fix the coin issue: give players the ability to convert coins into other resources
---
Ideas for conversion are as below:
---
500 coin= 20 gems
---
10 coin= 1 star points
---
500 coin= 7 tickets
---
(P.S.: bring back life leach)
---
make new upvote arrow design
---
I covered gene and frank already, but not barley. I was thinking about doing 2 but decided to ultimately go with one because the area denial with ten bottles on the field at one time would be absurd (5 from attack 5 from super). Maybe 2 free attacks would be good tho idk u never really know until u can actually use it in game
---
I know but most of the time I die and there is no body in a 10 tile radius and my teamate picks the power cubes
---
I‚Äôm as hard as metal

aww mehn! That's actually my caption on my tweet üòÖ I kinda regret that I didn't do that here too

Oh, how the tables have changed their position on the 3 dimensional plane

Honestly thoooooo, I agree

I got meteor rush today from big box
---
It‚Äôs so painful tho watching my friends with 2000 trophies get spike or crow tho
---
And what if you‚Äôre on mobile website :P
---
I wish you could go into matches with the same brawler as your team without it having to be random.
---
Dude this is AWESOME don't shit talk that ur bad at this
---
Here is my other account
---
If you are good with her she is good in Brawl Ball. Especially if overtime happens. Snappy Sniping is going to make her so much better in Brawl Ball
---
Frank, Leon, Poco: OP
---
Tick, Gene: Trash
---
Well she wasn't stupid.... Ur a pro dude
---
I just hate this steretype about Shelly 1 stereotype out of billions, that Shellys are stupid
---
It depends on skills, if u play Shelly it doesn't mean ur a nub, and if u play x brawler it doesn't mean ur a pro
---
Sorry dynamike gang :)
---
Its only possible in friendly matches
---
Bruh mortis never killed dynamike in this
---
oh no it you again
---
Mortis, Bibi, Poco, Bull, Shelly and Carl they will have 3 star powers. remember my words...
---
That would be so annoying
---
I like it, its cute
---
I just got spike today
---
what is happening in this picture my eyes hurt
---
Amazing work OP, I would give an award if it weren‚Äôt for the fact that I‚Äôm broke as fuck
---
Tara was damn hard to figure out
---
r/brawlstarsp
---
No, why?
---
Because barely anyone uses her
---
Protect the president game mode?!? Yesssss please
---
N√£o sei falso, parece rick
---
Superball cannot be destroyed!
---
Yeah. I guess its true
---
More high effort stuff, mods should remove stuff that are already discussed a lot and would have a top hat Mortis flair
---
Hey I'm from France.
---
I would like 3 simple things that would make your entire community happy:
---
-a night witch mortis remodel. 
---
-buff mortis reloading speed 15 %
---
-colored supers
---
-icons corresponding to the brawler's weapon on the kill count (not my idea, just supporting)
---
-give every brawler a familiar corresponding to it on the main screen, like give mortis a cute bat
---
Give shelly his turret
---
Give Primo a fist-shaped golden trophy.
---
My idea for a subreddit is to have it better organized with all the random meme posts or "get outplayed" sorted into their own megathread. I'm sure this isn't a super original idea, but it seems like a good idea.
---
is this a pixel gun reference?
---
Spike, Jessie and Crow are my faves
---
Shelly is a "good" character without star power?
---
the only place you'll be shaking is in prison
---
Removed - Your post is too short, please expand on your title.
---
Just think about his second star power though
---
Not really
---
It gives ~50 on average, Kairos made a video regarding that.
---
That's nearly identical to the starting icon
---
Ok
---
This is a new account so it‚Äôs not that rare to have that
---
Thats behind the wall genius
---
It would be better that jessie is banned from all big game cuz she's op
---
I would change darryls. Instead, his super roll range is increased by 350%.
---
brawl stars stickers pack xD lmao cheap ass forum
---
Definitely I hate those kind of teammates üòë except when they are forced to do so when our enemies are gonna corner us
---
Maybe before you release every update (or brawl talk) give us clues about who the new brawler is and give is clues on who's being nerfed/buffed.
---
Rules on low effort memes
---
I want Crow to be unkillable...
---
An update will be a good idea :D
---
I would love more AmAs, especially with brawl stars Devs and the subs mods. This would greatly help with the health of the game and the sub.
---
Evolution mate
---
That would be a dream come true ü§©
---
I don't get it
---
i would upvote but you tried to team
---
you know
---
the Mortis-
---
the Dynamike and Barley-
---
that look-
---
This would be useful info, at least. No need to tell people when Poco killed someone with his guitar or not  as the OP suggested because he only uses the single weapon. Seeing star power kills would be nice, however.
---
You sir, are a detective
---
This is the meme that summarizes my entire account
---
Ooooo that's a neat idea...
---
Sounds like a spin off of chess üëçüëç

Have developer updates that are biweekly. Just to talk about what they are planning.

Put more fanarts

---
Sorry i dont want to copy you
---
Haha thanks for your help on the Tier List man!
---
You literally said that is is
---
Alright, a suggestion that I have is that perhaps add a section where potential new posts and creations from new people in the subreddit can get quickly popular.  
---
Sometimes I see people who are new in this subreddit and post something, like an Art or a Concept, that usually doesn't get the amount of upvotes that I expect it to be. I want to change that.  
---
Usually, I feel like not only is GEDI-KOR's post getting alot of upvotes because the quality of his art is good. I think that it's also because a lot of people already know him, and tend to follow him, that way, they will be able to see his work as soon as possible the second he upvotes it. Unlike new people who have to rely on timing and basically luck, if people were to scroll down to their post.  
---
So perhaps adding some kind of section or flair that people can use if they aren't that popular but they feel like their work is worthy of a little popularity. 
---
Of course, some people may abuse it, but I think that there could some kind of a limit or a punishment.Personally, I feel like the only posts that are worthy of being deemed a potential possible post that could appear in Hot, are:  
---
* The good quality Art. 
---
* The Skin Ideas. 
---
* The new Brawler Concept Ideas. 
---
* Fan-Made Animation. 
---
* Fan-Made Music.
---
* And perhaps even art outside the computer, such as Air-Dry Clay Art.
---
Anyway, that is about all I could think of right now. Things that I feel are not worthy and do not deserve the flair or a section that shows their potential of being hot are:
---
* Meme Posts
---
* Petitions
---
* Box Openings
---
* Rushed Art, usually as a joke
---
* Low-Quality Animations that consist of selecting whole characters, not moving their limbs, and moving them with the mouse.
---
I hope you find reading this concept of mine to be intriguing, and I hope it can be something that is implemented into the subreddit one day.

Gene in gem grab lmao imagine having a frank with sponge and that gene every time the frank grabs a gem gene pulls him to saftey

Most days 4-5 hours. Although i had some days that peaked up to 8-9
---
Oh
---
This happened to me today my team was2 Jessie's  a Nita and a book and I was el primo 3mins14seconds depressed
---
They are acc perfect some could be toned down a little but otherwise they seem rly good frank destroying walls is a bit much but if it was like he doesn‚Äôt pierce the wall and it stops at the wall that would be ok and maybe the damage on his next attack is reduced afterwards
---
Can we just talk about how a thermos bottle does more damage than an exploding rocket?
---
r/thebrawlstarscactus
---
They were complete garbage
---
I got it
---
Make it so that when you invite a friend to the team mode is not automatically changed to capture crystals, and then we won well, okay. Sincerely, Brawl Stars player.
---
Imagine Shelly with band-aid as big boss, she would be invincible
---
Balancing is hard man üò™ people give Supercell too much crap for their ‚Äúbad balances‚Äù
---
Everybidy has great supers but jessie has a lame one
---
With your idea, gene shouldn't get the super back completely, i'd say halfway charged
---
That‚Äôd be a good strategy
---
Sigma nuts
---
Yea it looks nothing like Jessie ...the only way I could for myself to believe it would be a Jessie is the hat and goggles.
---
But definitely a nice rendition. Just re-work the face.

They deal the same damage, but that‚Äôs the power of soup lol

I hope for more theorycraft and discussions about strategy in this subreddit

oh dude vlw, i do yes, obg for the tip ‚ù§Ô∏è‚úåÔ∏è

Lucky play
---
It was really the super that exposed the bushes as well
---
We should add more community discussions
---
Crow
---
Perhaps a weekly type discussion post to discuss certain aspects of the game
---
Looking forward to that :)
---
A bit late to the parade...
---
Ik I said a week but I‚Äôm uploading it tomorrow
---
You could‚Äôve at least credited the owner of it :/
---
as a jess main i still prefer the first, shocky can shred on offensive turret spots but managing damage is still the most important part of big game (plus you get a compass at campers and shoot around corners.)
---
He needs a remodel
---
He is moving way to fast and replay's cannot lag
---
wtf?...
---
What? They have fewer trophies, and two of us have starpowers. In the match we were killing them really fast, like 5 seconds after they spawned...
---
I love it
---
My piper is 504 trophies and power 6 and I am 4600 trophies
---
So you wouldn't have auto aimed in that situation? And what do i have to do so i can prove you that i am not a noob
---
Of course! I‚Äôm going to release an updated version tomorrow due to popular demand with a lot of balances
---
Rico's is more op than Shelly with 20 cubes, super and Bandaid
---
And what?
---
thx u!
---
emotes are ok but you can't wrote the title in majuscules
---
Ok, I have have other brawlers at 500
---
I think if it will be decidÔºåit will only in friendly game
---
Emoji police
---
I actually don‚Äôt want club wars.  That would drive me away from clubs bc it‚Äôs too much extra work.  We need donations tho.
---
So unless if the balls are labeled, you can just take the ball in front of you and bring it into your goal.
---
I get how it'll work if the balls are labeled, but it's such a mess.
---
Thats not how you use the meme
---
Yeah I got killed from the other side of the map by his super in the blink of an eye üòÇ
---
Leon's star power plus Bull, Shelly, or Frank would be terrifying. Imagine a invisible Frank super slamming your whole team, or an invisible shotguner walking up out of no where to delete you off the map. Not sure if we are ready for that quite yet but I would love to see of the community can find an effective couter to it. The power could be balanced by removing g the invisibility upon your teammate receiving damage, or attacking
---
It's on itü¶áü¶áü¶áü¶áü¶áü¶áü¶áü¶áü¶áü¶áü¶áü¶áü¶áü¶áü¶á

So ticketed?
---
Due to popular demand, I‚Äôm going to release a modified version tomorrow with a bunch of balance changes and fixes, and Rico‚Äôs on the nerf list.
---
A lot of them are op
---
I like it. This will create the appropriate chaos and loss of trophies by chance and luck. Just like supercell intended.

---
I love playing tick he is so fun
---
It's on my second account bud
---
The invisibility on the teammate would work exactly the same as Leon‚Äôs invisibility, but I will be making modifications in a new post tomorrow due to popular demand
---
German like this post cause p**** in germany is dick
---
Did Penny just paid Leon to disappear ?
---
A lot of people have told me that which is why I‚Äôm releasing a modified version tomorrow with a lot of nerds and one buff for barley
---
They wont probably be 52 boxes cause all the boxes from showdown are rabdom but who cares i like this map good job
---
Matchmaking is based on a highest trophy person in a team
---
To prevent NOOBS from getting hard carried
---
Yes please I want free gems because I want to buy mega boxes because I want a new brawler I have 7000 Trhopies but I don't have any legendary üò≠üò≠üò≠
---
It looks great, maybe remove those skulls because they don't seem to be necessary
---
One idea I had for Poco was Tough Crowd: When Poco uses his super on enemy brawlers, they will get stunned for 2 secs
---
^ok
---
Sounds great man! Looking forward to see what you do with them.
---
I would really like to see more discussions of how to use the browlers in each game, which are best to be used and when...tactics and a lot of stuffs like news in advance from the official announcements. Thank you for the effort!
---
I put it right in the safe so it looks like the safe is healing us
---
But RANDOMS tends to not have ocds.... they place it 1 tiles off every time and it triggered me
---
Nope supercell creates mobile games for a reason sir
---
Bro the beats are awesome!
---
Then IDK if you made her a bit older or you made Jessie more childish..not criticizing it btw..amazing artwork there ^ ^
---
Just wondering why Penny is so strong that she could hold Jes like that heheh
---
This wouldn't work for the top players, they coule just match with noob friends and keep climbing. Sadly this is the only valid way
---
I potentially see this as a possible exploit since you can just leave your brawlers not upgraded and still have more than enough coins to get their upgrades?
---
This deserves a lot more upvotes for the time and effort that was put into this. Very well made!

I‚Äôm just trying to do what makes people happy :)

Best ever

This is just a example i did not mean add this icon the  whole idea is just add more icons that need some thing to do not only lv or trophies example (get 5kills in showdown to get this icon)

you're welcome

I‚Äôm a big fan of Leon‚Äôs. Think it would be really fun especially in Duo

To make things more clear -  Although this looks like animation, it actually isn't, It's actually called "Image sequence". What I did is arranged all frames together and made them like a playlist while reducing the frame time (increasing frame rate), So what actually happening is, the frames SC has released are being played one after the other. It looks like animation cause I reduced the frame time :D , It takes usually 2-5 mins to render this thing, So, I haven't actually put a lot of "effort" ; But I appreciate your comments  üëç .   
---
I appreciate every artist trying to color these and especially SC for releasing the frame, Can't wait to see the final product. \[Hope sound effects are included either\]
---
Yes every match for the first 24 hours nothing but ticks ...the matches were ridiculous...tick bombs flying everywhereeeeeeeeee
---
It was actually pretty funny....as in surely they are enjoying being able to have a free character rather than actually playing a match.
---
Took a few days and ticks presence finally began to dwindle down to a manageable state, thank goodness.

Darryl would be able to roll from the middle to the end üòÇ
---
Shoo! Shoo! Away with you hippy!
---
The matches will last five seconds
---
A few things: Many brawlers already have a third star power in the game files. I can't remember most of them, just that Carl's made it so his super destroyed walls.
---
Also, gene needs a star power he can use himself.
---
Well the bullets have an end, if they hit an enemy
---
Thx :)
---
Wha-
---
I‚Äôm sure Supercell will eventually give gene a star power he can use himself unless they take his support class super seriously
---
After some nerfs these would be the perfect 3rd star powers in the game

Yes, but it'd be like bibi's super is right now, but worse:  "OH MY FREAKING GOD HOW DID THAT THING HIT ME ITS RANGE IS SO LONG WTF"
---
The bullets could go quite a bit of time without hitting an enemy, and if there's one after every attack, multiple of them could buildup around the map.
---
At that point, it becomes dumb luck (i.e. RNG) if a player gets hit or not.  If a bullet is bouncing for 10 seconds before it hits you, it's not really "skill" on the rico's part, just luck.  That's not usually good for games, especially strategic ones like BS.
---
Ceee plm ?
---
Thank u :) Due to popular demand I have an updated version of this post coming out tomorrow with balances to the star powers
---
I plan to nerf Rico when I release the updated version of this post tomorrow
---
I want better user flairs something besides just the brawlers.
---
Rei is not nice.
---
Another ‚Äúfunny‚Äù and ‚Äúoriginal‚Äù post.Thanks

What software was used for this just curious

Guys I'm shaking

..
---
Ah gotchu. Also it's a thing that happens a lot in manga to make one character seem like a parent chastising the other. Explaining that just made it a lot less cute but bear with me haha.
---
Shame for spinning
---
You know about it
---

r/softwaregore
---
bruh...
---
I do not approve.
---
and this is why i don't attack poco when he is breaking a box
---
I know his pain
---
Ummm I think Darryl is op cuz u roll and do damage like wt*
---
It was lag. To compensate for starting the animation too late, it speeds it up
---
U not the real frank?
---
I spin but i never team bro
---
IM DETECTING SEISMIC ACTIVITY
---
GO AHEAD MR.JOSTURR
---
I can‚Äôt upvote its at 666
---
Thats a great map i would like to see it ingame
---
Would it be a reference?
---
We all know you dum dum
---
Okay, i'll let this one slide
---
Its a bug
---
dafuq ?
---
Shelly is so hard to unlock.
---
ill keep quiet on the condition that you make more fanart
---
13 k box? What?
---
I was waiting for primo's
---
Apesi pe cuvintele sugerate de tastatura, f original...
---
Kind of anime?
---
Nendoroid kid?
---
Bruh
---
The frames are actually by supercell themselves they released it in batches so we could color them op just pieced them together
---
They did
---
It's sad :)))
---
I just won one with the timer at 1:59
---
Someone gotta have a new phone after that
---
They were in a team!
---
Shelly rave
---
It's missing some frames from batch 1, though...
---
Some of these star powers are ridiculously stupid overpowered, OP probably just wanted karma so created a star power for the first thing that popped into his head.
---
I can imagine Morgan Freeman or Samuel L. Jackson voicing spike.
---
Hi
---
allowing posting memes only on weekends.
---
&gt;"Buff his IQ"
---
 That's not relatable to this post. Not even close to constructive criticism.
---
&gt;"Crow is balanced for now." Your only saying that because he's your main. I mean look at your profile banner.
---
&gt;"If u seriously wish for a Nerf in next update ull be surely gifted one (Nerf for band-aid)" 
---
Your grammar was highly incomplete Could not read what you said.
---
YES!!!
---
If that is Clash Royale, I can‚Äôt even imagine what Clash of Clans is like.
---
Wha...it‚Äôs not like everybody has the star power. You have to buy or unlock them, which can take a while
---
New game modes, characters, or stars powers
---
3k, have leon, tara and bibi
---
Ok so shelly is piper now?
---
I did, at the end. He would have just backed up, and shoot at me back. And super away, Since he has alot of range.
---
Call it oasis
---
I love the animation, but a couple things irk me:
---
Colt's bullet shells still on the round after firing
---
(you've probably heard that one already)
---
and Spike's cactus bomb rotating forwards after it's thrown
---
great work though I dig it üëç
---
Yeah it definitely does, I can see a clear differencd between my 2 accounts (one maxed / one far from maxed). Also I have heavy suspicion that star power drop from box is not equal, I have ~20 missing SP's on main and havent received one in (esimate) +500 boxes, however when my mini gets finally one brawler up to level 9, it seems to receive the star power within days.
---
Why?  Tick is an incredible brawler.
---
He‚Äôs great in Heist
---
Some tricks for a better gameplay will help
---
Lol..Ok..üòú
---
Maybe if the attack stopped after hitting the wall instead of continuing through like the super, that way he still can't attack through one.
---
Well done on the small details (painted nails, eyeshadow according to their respective colors)
---
No, that would still be ridiculously overpowered. A main attack should not destroy walls especially when his super already can.
---
Amazing vid man! It really helped out :D
---
Ah ok thx!
---
Thank you
---
Ok. Thanks for telling me. Sounds sick.
---
And poco?
---
Ooh, that sound nice !
---
OMG I love those, I am afraid you have to rename Dynamike‚Äôs though, Short Fuse is the name of his main attack already. And I agree that the Mighty Hammer (Frank) should work as Coiled Snake. Keep up the good work.
---
Please play some high ranked Ticks in duos, he is far from useless. The map also plays a huge affect into this though, but that's with all brawlers.
---
Looking at penny: Be gone THOT!!!
---
Looking at jessie: FBI OPEN UP!!!!
---
I got my best time of 330 with a level 8 tick
---
Hmmmm
---
I‚Äôve got balance changes coming out tomorrow due to popular demand, and I changed the name of dynamikes star power and I nerfed Frank
---
XD
---
Amazing fanart AND cake day? 
---
#DOUBLE HAPPINESS
---
hes a thrower soo he will throw em from up to down but horizontally he will shot em just like a normal nita shot or spike shot
---
I think you should nerf Rico's to only bounces off a limited amount of walls.
---
tbh emoji police should only stay for abuse of emojis to the point something is eithe unreadable or straight up spam, not for a single one or two
---
Yeah probably
---
It's just a cheap cash grab
---
Second is OP. You don't have it?
---
That is is
---
True, Or 20 pp = 1 star point
---
Bam, made the sub a thing now [r/BrawlHurtingJuice](https://www.reddit.com/r/YouFellForItFool/comments/cjlngm/you_fell_for_it_fool/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app)

Subreddit would be cool if
---
Awww, adorable!
---
This is why gem grab is the best mode lol
---
She did. The point was 5 shelly's teamed up.
---
On some maps he can also be good in brawl ball
---
Dang
---
Old Reeeeeeeeeeeeeeee

I pushed my Tick to 500 in brawlball..
---
bad thing is that, at 19 trophies you don't even have ticket events
---
No, leave star points to skins until Supercell adds more use for them because 20pp=1sp seems broken
---
Oooh I see, but is there no files available to download so he can still color them in for fun?

I had a lot of fun doing this challenge. And what better way to finish it off than to color in one of my favorite brawlers. Good luck to everyone who entered! Brawl on!
---
#GUYS, IM SHAKING
---
New skin: # SANS POC√ò
---
Wtf..
---
At least this one is fun unlike the ‚Äúoh I guess now I have basically two lives‚Äù star power
---
Come on agree or disagree....we both know why he made that post hahahaaa
---
Wait until we get emotes in game , you will miss the spinning action i promise LOL
---
I bought thorny gloves later opened a brawlbox and got plant life
---
#GUYS IM SHAKING
---
Thank u so much ü•∞ I wouldn‚Äôt worry about the adjustments because I have some coming out tomorrow to balance out some of the star powers
---
Totally agree with u xD
---
And the gold was mostly capped at about 56 depended on the gamemodes that were available
---
When I first read it I literally laughed my axx off
---
We all know how frustrating it is with a Jessie as big Brawler hahaa
---
I love it, but I have a feeling it‚Äôs stolen... credit?
---
i feel like i saw this before
---
There is no wrong answer
---
made with memeatic
---
Randoms
---
I believe this is a repost from them
---
Canon plural form, canonized by Lee Roy OJ Yarn person himself
---
Nope, Supercell released a teaser for the names of the new star powers, and there were 4 red names instead of 3, and only 7 gray names instead of 8
---
Love him or hate he's spitting straight faxs
---
What is it?
---
Vegetables* not vegitables.
---
This is in romanian and it means : "Whit your left hand you can't even make the sing of the cross, much less to rule a country" *that doesn't mean Tara, it means country*
---
I don't know why is this even here :/
---
Bringers of doom
---
honestly there is nothing special about him so it will be dumb to make him mythic
---
If it be true, everybody would leave brawlstars
---
Delete this
---
Tara really needs a reload buff, whenever you miss your super, it‚Äôs like getting punched in the nuts
---
Dang I knew you were intelligent after all. Good call on that correction big guy. Keep up the good work, it will pay off in the future.
---
It‚Äôs 19
---
Pam's will be OP if she manages to chain her turret in Boss Fight, Siege, or Smash and Grab
---
I love how the muscles are bigger even tho technically it dosent help the dmg
---
Haha I thought it was a game update
---
The death is cavern churn
---
I have crow power 10 and Leon power 3 at 7500 trophies
---
Wheres the safe
---
Include polls that allow members to vote for one possible idea that could be added to Brawl Stars!
---
dyna in double trouble?
---
Oof guess ik nothing lol
---
probably in a team
---
They should make a character where they‚Äôre super deflects all shots, potentially hitting enemy players
---
Oh okay. Thanks for the info
---
The should ban like 3 brawlers at a time
---
Carl seems fun
