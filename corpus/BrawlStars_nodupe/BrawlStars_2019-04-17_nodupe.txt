uh ok
---
---
---
Nice
---
Not really since I knew crow didn't need a buff and I accepted him to be op after buff
---
the drawing style reminds me of Steven Universe lmao
---
Hello there
---
Time to take a couple steps back and start the cycle all over again...
---
Damn
---
Rico
---
thanks for posting this 3 times
---
What is that?
---
Yes mods tighten up on this please
---
Fbi has my
---
Think that he needs a polish like Tara instead of a remodel.
---
No
---
"What's in YOUR wallet?"
---
hes still broken
---
If you think shelly is op then you probably don‚Äôt have many trophies. At lower trophy ranges, people don‚Äôt know how to distance themselves from her and it‚Äôs very easy to use her successfully. However, at higher trophy levels she‚Äôs not very good due to her range. This was a needed buff.
---
It probably wouldn't be that hard to do either.
---
?
---
Reverse card from the card game Uno
---
It wouldn‚Äôt work well in the game. Showdown just works much better with 10 people in the game and it would be really weird with 9,12,15,etc people. Duo showdown is good but anything more I don‚Äôt see working.
---
And it's not just tiny percentages no no no its stays exactly the same
---
Cries in Tara
---
I believe meteor shower should not be a feature to all showdown maps because not all people think it works. I think there should be an option on every showdown map for meteor shower to please all.
---
You can't remodel it but you can polish it making to look more better while still looking like the original.
---
I knew this was gonna happen. I don't think he needed that buff maybe they could ad a different buff were they nerf damage and Nerf something else but buff something else from him so he's ok in every game mode and not super op in one
---
Would have been better of u said shelly: * super stacks *
---
if*
---
6714 trophies missing all the legendaries and Gene. I think I am just greedy.
---
What a very interesting character. It has a really cool mechanic and I think it‚Äôs really well balanced. The descriptiveness could be lessened though
---
Lumber Jack!
---
There is no woooosh in Ba Sing Se
---
Cool, but the design looks like your average pyrotechnic. It needs something special to make it stand out.
---
Stiffness 100!
---
Maked
---
island invasion will always be bad no matter what rework you do to it
---
Yeah I tried to make my own design so I got some help from FLE. This is the best we could produce. I'm sure that if this got added ingame, supercell would execute it much better.
---
Thank you!
---
i hate it
---
You've probably unlocked most of the easier to pull brawlers so the rest of them have a lower chance of dropping
---
Fair point ü§£
---
no she has the fastest reload in the game
---
I couldn‚Äôt agree more, not the biggest fan of the new update. I miss when everyone sucked! When did everyone get so good?
---
I'm no u/GEDI-KOR , but after seeing all of his skin ideas I decided to make a skin for my favorite brawler
---
How many times has he gone through surgery and suffering again?
---
The black stripe
---
Finally. Some words of wisdom
---
Nope
---
Oh lol oops
---
The latest thing I've unlocked is Spike and I still don't have El primo.
---
He's become Crow before buff.

My Brock does? It's just a new dance
---
How?
---
You guys that keep complaining about siege, a fair mode where you can use your skill to win games(bad randoms can be on both sides), is it because you have no skill whatsoever from playing solo showdown and gaining easy trophies from teaming? The only mode that's not balanced is showdown right now, so losing trophies in siege is on you.
---
thats getting too greedy. just no 10 coins thats all
---
Dammit. I loved darryl rolling and getting stuck lol
---
Its nuts in Duo showdown how players are invincible when respawning. I get it that you don‚Äôt want people to die instantly but it‚Äôs imbalanced. Invincible players also shouldn‚Äôt be able to attack!
---
[removed]
---
when you dont have friends to even play duos and people want a trio gamemode
---
8
---
Its also about timing
---
Oof
---
I dont have spike :(
---
I actually saw that she has very low attack damage but an extremely fast reload time, allowing her to attack for a lot of quick damage
---
lol he is op now all supercell needed to do was nerf pam-one of crows hard counters
---
His star power sucked now its ok.
---
Im glad that you love it,i remember coraline use to terrify me so i tried to make it into this skin because when pwople see this on leon they will run away(inside joke from my childhood XD)
---
Everyone who thinks she is op are people with shelly at 300 trophies with a total trophy count of 301
---
Only petition i back up %100
---
yup \^
---
Lol
---
*Someone who agrees with everything*
---
#NOW THATS WHAT I CALL IMPOSSIBLE 69
---
Why wear the majestic eagle when you can wear the enemies pet bird
---
F
---
Supercell really we need nerf shelly in damage and distance, why you did this buff??
---
Nani is it
---
It would have to be very, very low, because if it was difficult to dodge then it would essentially be like stopping enemies from being able to heal. Think of it like a Gene constantly harassing you all game from very far away.
---
Having something hit so consistently from so far away is a big deal. It might work perhaps if the range of the cannon was severely reduced.
---
I tell all my hoes, rake it up
---
There is. But you have to join their band to do so.(where the report feature is)
---
1 shelly
---
OOF
---
Mass penny
---
Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm praying it comes out Friday but ppl can‚Äôt be mad if it doesn‚Äôt, it hasn‚Äôt been officially confirmed yet.
---
Love the work some people but into drawings
---
Lmao I feel you on the 10 coins part, but let's be  honest bro,  dem  Legendary rates be killing us üòÇüíØ
---
It will probably get a nerf for big game just like frank
---
Lies, he would have gotten Dynamike and Bo at the bare minimum. People just salty.
---
A√≠ sim

Is this a joke?

Congrats

She's a rare brawler and i don't think rare brawlers are hard to get
---
Big game is what you mean,,, which is a bug game to me...

Shellies deserve this i was a 10 leon and a 1 shelly killed me with superüòîüò¢
---
r/cursedimages
---
9 people or 12?
---
that‚Äôs the problem
---
No she is going to be 49 because she doesn't change her pose while shiba nita has a change in her position
---
Yes.
---
I can still see the mean greediness in her eyes... Her cannon looks good, but I can't even imagine her in a cute dress
---
Or just use the "do not disturb" button duh
---
Yeah I would buy it
---
Better be 9
---
I'm not buying that thanks for ruining it boi
---
Don‚Äôt worry, just don‚Äôt make it sound longer, 325 days.
---
Or just 3153600 seconds
---
What about high level brawlers..?
---
So don't sort by new?
---
I would then need to save up 1250 for the actual upgrade tho ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

What device do u use?

Same+ happy cake day

True! Soz didn't know lucky I stuck to my og idea üòå

WTF Reddit?

just make mortis be able to dash through walls lmao
---
Yes
---
Ik right everybody always goes for the piper
---
I need more of these
---
I am pushing only in solo... I want to name this challenge... But it is not as popular...
---
he is literally one of the best in the game
---
Might as well not use reddit then.
---
YES, unless your bad with his star power, you can practice in friendly game, you can also getting lucky from a box and unlock his star power it‚Äôs worth it.
---
I think, SUPERCELL should buff common attack, but nerf SUPER (time to reload it)
---
I think they should make a new one, including new brawlers (gene, carl, rosa, leon), and maybe get them all in
---
Mine was Penny, to me Shelly was very easy to push up.
---
Sriracha barley?
---
Thank you kind sir
---
Old one looks a lot better, you better not touch him... :P
---
Yeah they should update this one
---
But I would have to wait for another 1250 gold to actually upgrade to level 9
---
What was with some not even working originally
---
This has happened in like every supercell game ever
---
stun?
---
I dont like the new model for bo
---
Haha not too surprising though tbh tho lol
---
He doesn't shoot faster just now his animations are smoother so it seems better.
---
Really nice build but you missed the bull with 7 power cubes on the middle
---
Yey
---
YDAVE GEMS FOR ROSA
---
I SMELL A RAT
---
I lose in ‚ÄúShelly is too OP!‚Äù Hahahahahhahahah
---
SAVE GEMS FOR ROSA
---
Oh, then i guess you have to play a lot, like half the day, or full days, (I play brawlstars 24/7) so I get a lot of coins, just keep getting star tokens and tokens and you should be good
---
Hey Lord AntiLowEffortBot. I think you're on the wrong website. Reddit is an entertainment site, what were you expecting?
---
People ain't gonna stop these jokes cause a bot told 'em to. Please stop spreading hate.  
---
This is a bot. Beep boop.
---
Hahahaha get it, subs he she it I fell for wish exist???1?1?1?!?
---
Why this little game continue have a connection problem. I mean even LOL can play with 20 ping but this game just got so many lags? Does that even make sense?
---
Reddit is made of of subreddits. They are what makes Reddit Reddit. There are subreddits about everything: Movies, cats, dogs, space... And there are subreddits for people to post the subs they fell for, thought they fell for etc. This is normal. What is wrong is you attempting to ruin their fun. Stop.
---
To subreddit lovers, this bot is just a jerk. Don't stop linking to your subs because some jerk made fun of you.

Hello, just a reminder that the subsifellfor joke is no longer and was never funny and is way overused.

Sesame Street's gonna sue you now

While he has a Rocket Launcher, he is not some crazy guy that screams AAAAAAAAAAAAA and claims his nation to be the best. Bo is nearest to that, also he has explosives.

he doesn‚Äôt do any damage at all to the robot

When does Rosa come out
---
&lt;c4&gt; Me 2 üòé &lt;/c&gt;
---
I wanted Phoenix Crow because of the massive super glitch
---
lol This woudn't be the actual in-game model :)
---
lol
---
Just trying to get comment karma
---
Um what?
---
That rule still applies to her
---
It could be, but he does not have a minigun-like attack. Also he doesn't leave food for others to heal, Pam does. Sort of.
---
Only beta players would understand....
---
Bots are also power 10
---
You could be right, I chose Colt because he has a pistol and that attitude of his
---
You get 2x coins for the leftover power points. So if you only needed 1 to get it to level 9, you‚Äôll get 48 coins instead of 24 power points.
---
Someone make him breath so SC can delete it
---
That‚Äôs very true but I expect mortis as scour is the fastest character same as mortis and of course bat = shovel
---
I like how no one comments on the actual post, &amp; instead clowns the dude for his color tags.  
---
Super impressive man, hope the glitch gets sorted out soon so you can get some credit.
---
I do, but not at the moment unfortunately. We can still chat about it, for when I get a bit of free time if you'd like. Feel free to shoot me a message :)

They are sniping you. Report them

How nice but  how Bad of what he is

Why tho?

Soy yo, o es que se mira mucho mejor el logo antiguo de Brawl Stars? (Me gusta much√≠simo por cierto :"3)
---
Wait, you guys really used the Brawler Button?
---
Supercell shows how good their game is again.
---
Well I hope then the percentage of damage reduced it decreased by alot, if not then good luck
---
bullet from mario?
---
I will not downvote u i get downvotes for just my opinion all the time and what u say is true
---
Ste man
---
and  no one is defending shelly? other teammate can defend shelly and plus thats stun can hit others too if in range
---
NP but most of the people find it funny
---
Yeah
---
Thanks for sharing your opinion however I think star powers should be adding new mechanics. Jessie heals her turret, Mortis gains health from kills, Spike‚Äôs super heals spike etc. I have coded games and if Brawl Stars is written in an object-oriented language these Ideas shouldn‚Äôt be hard to implement. Also, can you explain why you don‚Äôt like these ideas so the next time I do something like this I‚Äôll keep them in mind. Thanks
---
Really?
---
Tara [Screams in subtitles].
---
Nice üôÑ
---
Or is this a joke
---
The new remodel is looking great
---
im just saying peoples should appreciate the hard work that the developer is putting so much effort into this. everyone want this and that as if this is ez to implement with all the other stuff
---
Iam very mess thes mode
---
These videos are just shit made by 8 years old kids
---
Don't question 2019
---
Big agree, nice chart
---
I'm on 6900 trophies without a single legendary.
---
You'll be waiting a while given you've unlocked one so soon.
---
That also works if u r smart,  like if u buy those new brawler offers else if you waste gems on mega boxes, ur money is gone
---
Idk y but roflmao
---
What the hell did he think he was fighting for?
---
Who even would watch that?
---
probably a troll.
---
Yes in fact it removes the Tribal aspect of Bo in the first place, just like how the English pushed the Natives from their lands and gave them territory that is baron.
---
If you use Crow's 2nd skin and do what's you're doing in the video, the bird gets super big sometimes and glitches out. You should try it.
---
More like "El hombre murci√©lago"
---
Is this a Leon Joke?
---
**reeeee**
---
Ya but at that point you‚Äôd die anyway since you‚Äôre at 100 health .-.
---
LOL.
---
hes gonna start eating barleys instead and get drunk
---
YES
---
||Your name is coded||
---
Why?
---
He prolly did that on purpose.
---
Hmmmm
---
Aw really?
---
Thanks
---
I don't think she needs a Nerf cuz charging her super takes like 15-20 hits so she definitely deserves 80% damage reduction after that 
---
If supercell is nerfing her super then they should make her super chargable by 5-10 shots. Brawlers like frank can charge his super in just 3 hits so she is not at all OP, she doesn't need a Nerf at all
---
try uninstall the gameÔºåand forget about it
---
:)))
---
Bruh you got this! I'm rooting for you!
---
we all have to quickly push your trophies when you get her before she's miserably nerfed...
---
No its Nacho Libre give him respect he's way older
---
When 150 coins cost 20 gems, 229 coins cost 30,53 gems.
---
looks like brock tbh
---
STOP IT
---
You mean ‚ÄúB‚Äù
---
she does have a voice. it's just a mask covering her mouth that's all
---
Agreed but it will happen only once (for 6s) in every 30   seconds, she won't be able to charge her super before making 30-40 hits as big brawler
---
That is YOUR luck factor may not be other‚Äôs
---
go on help and support and they will say it‚Äôs a bug. If it is a bug they will fix it and it will me high. Happened to me like last year. I got mad and when I saw my chance I got happy. bcz It wasn‚Äôt low it was high
---
That‚Äôs a mega box what about the f2p
---
It takes literally 3 hits and it can splash
---
We all know
---
I'm sorry but this is a shit idea
---
Maded
---
Thats the reason he wormates those bats
---
Feat or famine? I never heard of it. Did you mean shellyville?
---
Wow u are so smart.
---
And she is **RARE** 
---
A ton of people would be using her
---
Cool

The last one is a unknown strategy. Are you even a human?

"I just won 1 game and got over top 1. Now let me get straight to the leader board and don't let it update buut bitch about it right away"

Sicko mode
---
Spinners for the win

I tried this, its just the timer
---
This would be good if it wasn't for the fact that it's possible for the enemy to not let u leave via camping jump pads on burst brawlers
---
Crow bouta super outta there

fred: now let see who is energ y drink really is.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
everyone: RAGE SPELL?!
---
rage spell: its supercells fault
---
How many times do I have to say this, POWER LEVEL DOESN‚ÄôT MATTER IN MATCHMAKING
---
Currently, she needs 9 hits to charge her super. That's insane in Big Game.
---
No they're auto aim noobs
---
No, you must understand that there are people who are trying to collect boxes and suddenly after 100 boxes a legend comes and he goes joyful to play and loses to the usual shell, which, incidentally, is given at the beginning (I am using Leon and Crow)
---
This made me wonder what would happen if we had fps mode
---
#There is no death, only a bringer of doom
---
Cupcake Darryl looks so SWEET
---
This brawler named Nash is an assassin brawler and is a relative of mortis
---
Health - 3200
---
Basic Attack - 1120-1660 (6 tiles) 
---
Super - 1340-1820 (8 tiles) 
---
 
---
Basic Attack (Slash) - Nash swings his sword creating an attack wave that damages enemies and deals 1120 pts of damage. After choosing which direction Nash will fire his basic attack, he can position himself by dashing in a specific direction (dash=2 tiles).  Note that you should cast his basic attack and choose where direction to dash using the joystick at the same time to trigger the dash effect. Casting his basic attack forward while dashing backwards is possible.
---
Super (Execute) - Nash empowers his sword making it deal more damage. Nash will charge for a short while (like frank before doing super) then performing a quick dash in a distance dealing 1340 pts of damage. Note that while dashing, Nash doesn't take any damage for a while and can be targeted again after the quick dash. 
---
Star power - After hitting an enemy target by his super, he gains an increase of movement speed for 1 second and can be stacked depending on number of enemy hits. (Total time of increase of mvmnt speed)
---
Note: the picture there is not really mine, i traced that and changed some details (im not really good at drawing sorry) 
---
Creds to deltagamegirl22 for the picture.
---
Yes, maybe they are.
---
But we are not manüôÇ
---
That's the problem bro, the system did not consider the power@@
---
People have the ability to think and they know that not betraying is the smartest thing to do as all the others will turn against you when you betray. Teaming with Shellies, bulls etc. only happens when they get the chance to kill you and they don't or when you both benefit from the situation 100%.
---
No They must be Balanced if They were too strong They would kill Everybody and the Game would be pay to win beacouse if you dont have a legendary you would just lose
---
I really like this update but I think nerf Pam is the worst balance in all Supercell games. There are changes I like and ones I dislike even when they're just, but I must complain about Pam neef. 
---
I think Pam was the most balanced brawler since she could defeat any brawler and could also be defeated with the same chances, but now it's a bit easier to kill Pam (yes, I said the worst balance and a "bit" easier) (maybe I'm exageraitng, but I really feel bad about this change and I wanted to show my dislike).
---
Did you do that because a part of the community complained or because she was really OP? If so, could you share the data you use to conclude that? In my experience she was really well balanced but maybe that's not equal for most players.
---
Dont think matchmaking has ever been based on power, only brawler trophies
---
Omg charged darril
---
Bad idea it will be a big nerf to him cuz now u have more obstacle to grab ennemies
---
It‚Äôd be abuse. And people would be idiots and think ‚ÄúThese two brawlers teamed against me‚Äù when he was simply a larger threat and they didn‚Äôt want to die.
---
Don't get fool by top players.
---
Can we play together from 6464 trophies but I'm bad at the game and you will prob ignore meüòî
---
that the 'weak wifi' problem is resolved xD
---
Everyone found that out in the first 20 mins of the update being released that was the first thing I did when the update was out
---
Puahed him from 450 to 500 after the update too easily. Carl is a BEAST on wheels
---
you can Install the Mod If youre on Android and record it yourself :)
---
sorry im gonna delete this

I kinda like it tho it looks goofy but it sort of turns away from the tribal aspect of Bo

Bro i know buying pp is not a good deal but im buying it only for mortis to get his sp asap im not  buying other brawler pps so i can save up coins after that

I'm wondering how the hell anyone's going to stop her scoring in brawl ball when her super is active.

Bull shit. Yeah, you could make plays with him on brawl ball with his super but his super took fucking forever to charge. I‚Äôm not going to play as a crow that throws toothpicks against an el primo charaging at the goal just so I can have 1 chance to make a good play with my super.

This post fits perfect with my recently posted video lol what a contingency
---
How many trophies do you have in the game ?
---
Great idea dude...starting a new match by accident is so annoying. Hope Supercell puts it in the game...Keep the good ideas coming bro.
---
Sometimes you get very good randoms. But don't play if you don't have any friends online because you if you lose you lose 10-12 trophies which is hard to earn in higher leagues. Barley and Primo are good for seige provided your teammates have good brawlers too. Also try watching some tutorials. Ash has made a video on how to win with randoms.

I have every brawler exempt Leon and crow been playing for 103 days

And kairos time says I need a play for 2 yrs to get every brawler f2p

Imagine Rosa in Life leach, she‚Äôd use her shield and take less damage I think
---
Yeah... I feel like every brock players I get in my team are blind.
---
Yeah she‚Äôs only Gona be like 20 gems
---
I'm free-To Play Btw!
---
Shut the f word up!! üò°üò°üò°
---
/s
---
But for real shut up
---
Yea I know! I was just thinking that. Btw can u sub to my new subreddit:) thx for the comment
---
That's not what I meant but.. ok.
---
ohshitohshitohshit-
---
Or just move the cancel button to the middle
---
Absolute genius
---
I'm not suggesting it lol, I'm just sayin' it'd be a bad idea.
---
In CR 5 clans come for a war. So the battles will be 1v1. Here there are no 1v1 modes. Seems like a good idea because clubs are useless right now.
---
Mortis is a counter to throwers, so try to target them. And run away from tanky brawlers.
---
Nice, I have 11K but I don't push my brawlers to more of 500
---
You're not*
---
I got rico from 428 to 264 once it was n o t e p i c
---
Woo woo woooo
---
Why
---
For Anyone saying this will stop teaming or do something to then it want do that at all
---
Why is my name showing the color tags now?
---
I‚Äôve played with you before then
---
this image shows the exact emotion it's trying to portray
---
More like a gif
---
lol, its not a bug, it just goes to the first reward available
---
It‚Äôs like a weird elixir ball
---
I won‚Äôt actually save boxes this time ill just buy it for 19 gems lol
---
its a conquer or be conquered world i'd do it again in a heart beat you know what i'm saying
---
Wait you guys can cancel games? Whenever I press the cancel button, I get put into a game anyway :/
---
Maybe not the full thing, maybe a weaker version, like instead of +400 damage per shot for Piper, it's +100 in a bush.
---
Because I played the game and got trophies?
---
Honestly I can‚Äôt even recreate it. I got all the little guys except 2 somehow
---
Dang that‚Äôs a lot of Karma
---
yes
---
Dynamike
---
Sry, do you mind if I use this for a crappy meme format?
---
It looks good but I think it‚Äôs funny how the spike is taped on
---
Got 33 once
---
also an ally bot to test the healing and stuff pls
---
My GUESS is next week friday
---
I do not have much karma, xD. But thanks I guess?
---
No, he says "who wants some TNT"
---
i dont get it
---
all name changes should be free especially people who fucked up
---
I have bug that im my showdown no one kills eachother and then there is like 5man groups
---
You do not hear shots from shellys and bull and sometimes more brawlers
---
Cheers for the credit.
---
Sure
---
What can actually stop her with her super though
---
Lmao thanks
---
Yes thank you OF
---
And yeah as you say, all brawlers in-game are almost perfectly balanced excepted Pam still, I mean you always see her in a lot of modes, Gem Grab, Showdown (in which she is almost always seen teaming, like are people so bad that they really need to do that with Pam?), sometimes Brawlball and a lot in Siege.
---
I don't know what to think about Shelly though. She may be not that strong at higher trophies, if they'd buff her again she would actually become a true monster at lower trophies.
---
ooh, ok; maybe it‚Äôs affecting primarily shotgun brawlers?
---
barley is annoying as hell
---
Removed - Your post is too short, please expand on your title.
---
He‚Äôs good at making 2d designs, but he has stated that he is just starting to learn 3d designing. There‚Äôs a long way before he‚Äôs ready to actually implement skins in game.
---
I saw the idea from you :)
---
someone with an energy drink and 20 boxes
---
Ohhhh ok thanks
---
Noob pipers in bounty lmao
---
Alright, I can agree with that. I mean i understand why they buffed him because he is a legendary but seemed more like a rare. I understand your points and by no means does he need a nerf or another buff. He's fine where he is you make valid points that showdown seems to be where he's best but in other modes not so much. It always depends on the maps. Yeah I guess he did need a little buff but not as much as a lot of community makes it out to beüòÇüòÇ yeah I get it
---
Hello there,
---
You can write a ticket to the support using **/Parameters/Help and Support** in BS app.
---
Explain your problem, sent them your screenshot and they will do the rest.
---
They will refund you and take back everything the offer gave you.
---
**/!\\** If you opened a Mega Box or more in this offer, be careful because they will take you 80gems for each Mega Box you openned. (If its like Clash Royale, I one time made this mistake !) **/!\\**
---
Hope it help !
---
Bekkario,
---
How can i get star shelly?
---
are you saying that the legendary percentages dont change when you BUY a brawler instead of unlocking it?
---
People already do this and it‚Äôs legal
---
flair does not check out.
---
This video is not about me facing 5 dudes at a time...READ THE TITLE PROPERLY.
---
thats right, i would be really happy if the matchmaking looked like this in the matches i play
---
I like gedi's more, but i still like the remodel.
---
I just like to make character alignment charts
---
How about an auto fire
---
I liked the map.
---
Needs more upvote !!
---
Only the frank one is pretty bad, bulls is decent actually, jsut maybe not necessarily worth 80 gems atm. They‚Äôll ad effects to it though
---
Well I have a thirst for trophies so no thanks lol
---
nice
---
The belt he wears is connected to the bomb, there is also a belt around the bomb
---
Probably just have high üèÜ, not sure tho
---
&gt;pls subscribe to my channel
---
&gt;pls help
---
He did .. Energy drinks and healing mushroom would not spawn near reamers. Watch the brawl talk again XD
---
Depends on your rank
---
I see you visualised it though, something I couldn't be bothered to do. So credit to you too. üòâ

Now THIS is a QoL update I can get behind! This was me yesterday lol

This subreddit is only for English posts. You should remove the post and repost it in Englishüëç

OMG stop
---
I have 69 gems
---
niceee
---
Thanks!
---
Lmfao
---
uma dica, poste em ingles pq aqui 80% √© gringo
---
I think you're overestimating the size of the team behind brawl stars... The brawl stars team isn't like any big corporation
---
It‚Äôs a common way to call that to a character because you love them so much that you wanna protect them.
---
But Supercell just doesn't have the manpower to do that. 'Overwatch' might not work if not given good rewards. And bots make mistakes.
---
What do you think of this idea?
---
Wierd haha
---
Well why like why what?
---
As long as I know, every emoji works lol

Only legendary percentage increases and it does that really slowly
---
Yeah I saved up around 150 gems for Carl, and I only needed 59.
---
Gems from boxes &gt; Just boxes
---
I swe near here
---
That's okay. I am thankful for people who sort by new like you. Thanks dude
---
I haven't saved any boxes for her
---
Just 1 mega box from trophy Road and 55 gems
---
This is ass
---
If you didn't know, this was posted 3 weeks ago
---
Man, the old models looked way better
---
Well I played duo showdown on Rockwall Brawl. Pretty okay as I had been paired with either good or decent randoms and did not get cornered by any pair.
---
Make it so you‚Äôre able to use your star power
---
Brawl ball is a very bad game mode.
---
I will buy her
---
Teaming is not as bad as people say? O.o
---
Lmaoooo
---
Bruh Rosa is gonna wreck the shit outta him, especially with her super
---
Shelly doesn't need her super when she has energy drink most of the time
---
Everyone has the same rare factor
---
trophees
---
Laughs in 105 gems
---
Such artwork should be preserved in mus√©e du louvre
---
True
---
I mean teaming isn't bad , but it wad too OP , teaming is quite tricky and from supercell completely supporting OP teaming to this , it's still good
---
I think gene is balanced now
---
I‚Äôm 14.5k but you don‚Äôt see me flexing on this fallen soldier
---
The training cave may not be too exciting beyond getting a feel for Mortis and the legendaries before I pull them, but spamming supers in the horde is a lot of fun.
---
Yeah this is a repost. Made a long time ago by someone
---
The update description litterally says she is a rare...
---
Nah, leon is right there, on the brawlers, behind the phrase
---
Show me da wae
---
Stuns
---
why downvote a bring back life leech comment :(

She isnt comming tomorrow

This one gets it!

It‚Äôs a purple skull lmao

That‚Äôs not a bug that‚Äôs how every algorithm work in every game.It‚Äôs use to make you play more and not be that frustrated that you stop playing

I've never seen someone that's more lucky...  
---
I'm 5k with 16 brawlers...
---
sam
---
Lmao
---
hoho
---
You don‚Äôt have to wait for OP to answer, Exe is right
---
So it‚Äôs useless to buy if you can‚Äôt see  the difference (idk if I would spend 10$ for a little animation that I don‚Äôt notice )
---
I MADE THE SAME POST BEFORE THIS ONE AND IT ONLY GOT 7 UPVOTES!!!!!!!!
---
So I reinstalled the game because I was having issues, some sounds of some brawlers attacks where not playing in game and now when I try to get my account back I get that, wtf?
---
***WHAT***
---
Next draw a beat up Leon thrown in a cage
---
Make sure you quit the game and restart before trying anything else. If it doesn't work remove Brawl Stars and download it again. If that doesn't work contact Supercell Support.
---
"created" totally not reposted/stolen. credit the original
---
Isn't there a way you guys can make it so coins work like gems too where you can remove them? I will be more careful from now on but this is the first time I have mistakenly purchased something thus I was confused on why would the gems be removed but the coins are. 
---
It is my fault in theory but now I technically owe 4 purchases of the 170 gems packs to make up this mistake and I feel that could be a bit polemic in the future between others who make these errors.
---
Thanks for the support however
---
Ya, I'm on android. I used a app called du recorder..U can find it on play store.

Hello! I'd like to ask you if I could use your clip as a part of my compilation of Brawl Stars Highlights. I'm an editor for the Gaming Curios network. You would be credited with your name on the screen along with a link to this post. Let me know, thank you! :)

Carl is my name, geology is my game

Slow down, just make it mandatory to put a spoiler tag.

You literally stole my/maltane's idea and gave neither of us credit. The post was literally at the top of Hot when you posted, you are completely bullshitting.
---
Why did you post this 3 times now?
---
For me is the same but is glitched with the play button not the skulls
---
Well you seem to like posting at 3AM I don't see why you wouldn't have looked through posts too.
---
Haha that would be a bit good if you got Gems everyday. You would probably only be able to get Gems as a reward a couple of times a week.
---
Wait but the robot isn‚Äôt the one bouncing...

I don‚Äôt get it

Such a nice idea! I would love it.
---
Cause I am a YouTuber and I don‚Äôt even have crow (my channel is Doom9736)
---
I don‚Äôt understand
---
I own an iPhone XR and it can stream, play brawl stars, and listen to music at the same time with no lag or frame drops. The A12 bionic chip in the iPhone XR makes it the fastest phone chip ever (production). So it is definitely a good option for the 750$.
---
I can‚Äôt view it
---
It's an awful skin for 80 gems but I would definitely use more than normal crow it if was free. I am ashamed anywaysüòî
---
Looks nice :D

Wrong again.

&gt;The other feature was Hypertext Markup Language (html), the language that allowed pages to display different fonts and sizes, pictures, colours etc. Before HTML, there was no such standard, and the "GUIs we talked about before only belonged to different computers or different computer software. They could not be networked.
---
HTML is the father of all web interface coding
---
Yes really
---
Good point

No, It shows like that if you are rank 20 and between 460-500 trophies

Thank you,this is my first time to upload things on Reddit
---
I'm convinced now that Leon is part of the same tribe as them as well. They all undertake some sort of animal and have their abilities. I wasn't convinced before because Leon was just wearing a chameleon hoodie. But, now that they remodeled Bo and purposely made him wear an eagle hat, I think they're all connected and just wanted some "kid friendly stuff".
---
I dropped my brother 2 legendaries sooo.... btw he plays really agressive

It's not supposed to show the bar, the bar is supposed to be empty

Hello, here are your ideas for the Bravl Stars for the May GLOBAL update and so
---
Scins
---
1: Assassin Leon;
---
2: Ice Cream Spike;
---
3: Mummy Tara;
---
New Carti:
---
1: Face Spike;
---
2: Map is full of bushes;
---
New Features:
---
1: Clan Chest (many people want this)
---
2: Emodie;
---
3: To be given as a reward for fame Gemas
---
New Character:
---
The miner is 4500 hp for 1 lvl, the damage is 800, the Super Miner when he buries himself under the ground and someone doesn‚Äôt betray him, he can vyprigut anywhere (you manage them when he buries) the star power when he is ill under the ground;
---
I hope you will pass the information to the developers, because I do not know English well, and I can‚Äôt write in the editor, please pass the information, I thought it was 2 days
---
also, there could be a gui like in showdown if you want V1(regular) or this
---
Mainly my point was that you were wrong in your ASSUMPTION because if you check leaderboards rn I‚Äôm still not there and you were just trying to make me seem like I was desperate for upvotes and tried to get a ss before leaderboards updated
---
Lol Power Ranger Tara
---
C U R S E D
---
Yeah that‚Äôs what I thought
---
What do you think you are saying? None of it makes sense.
---
Good, they should change it because tgey probably forgot to.
---
Thank u
---
bUfF cRoW
---
Unironically tho I got poco level 7 to 500 just by sd
---
It was at least a minute of this, not fun
---
Nice Apex legends porn bro lmaooo
---
Then what happens if they add an idea that multiple users created? Take as an example any oversugested idea. I think that‚Äôs why SC doesn‚Äôt do this unfortunately
---
what these are for  the mini pekka  watch out man
---
That sniper shot tho
---
YES! Especially to the drink
---
The artwork has very good quality, good job man!
---
I GOT IT MK
---
I contacted supercell support and they said that they‚Äôre aware of the issue and to keep checking the App Store for bug fix updates.
---

---
Removed - You have a negative karma score, please fix this before posting again. This action is to prevent spam on the subreddit.
---
If you are unlucky as me and don't have every other brawler at lvl 9 or them all full, this won't help much tbh.
---
Rico buff failed so i went with leon cuz he got nerfed
---
i fucking hate barley. good luck to you.
---
No im just saying ,for example in brawl ball it would help
---
What a gameplay man
---
U forgot Kirby
---
It wouldn‚Äôt be that op, it would just make him powerfull in that mode, its like a small buff
---
Whoa, men, this is way better than supercell!
---
Makes more sense, still sucks though
---
Lol 420 upvotes
---
Is this a joke,or something?
---
Like jumping on a tramboline lol
---
I always try to go on them and then get out of the radius quickly so they blow up without any damage done to us  ... 25% success rate
---
We need a primo extinguisher.
---
I bet there is gonna be that one guy that's gonna be whining about how this dude has got spike at ,3.7k and how he doesn't have any legendaries at set trophies.
---
Well ya... But didn't it kinda feel like everything in the update was you know... Going to be released with the update?
---
It ded
---
You are a degenerate and reddit isnt for you,get out now.
---
Because of morons like you, we see the same fucking posts 50 times a day
---
Supercells lol
---
Ofc you would say that you are biased to crows.
---
how do you like it if his hat is falling?
---
Everyone knows it by now!!! Thousands of people already posted this.
---
My chances of getting the 11th gem from their Shelly
---
XD
---
Also bulls a loser
---
Why would it fall down?
---
Honestly if she is in trouble she should be jumping behind a wall or somewhere that's not easy to follow. Positioning is part of skill too -- if you're caught in a place with no escape, that's probably your own fault in a game like this.
---
Probably a star power...
---
Buff Spike? Really?
---
Nobody asked for mine, they just took it
---
So what kido lol you are 10 yrs old and you are trying to be cool  shut up and what if i stole it lol
---
Can someone tell me what Penny is saying?
---
He wants that 11th gem
---
Who cares, nobody died. They already got donated 1 billion. The rebuild would probably not even cost that amount of money
---
I want to get the joke. I just dont get the joke.
---
I mean if i had to pick between crow and bull for who to be a bodyguard i would choose bull.1 he is massive.2 he has a shotgun.3 He ain't scared to take on anybody. Crow isn't exactly bulky so.
---
It was because I was choosing Carl!! üòÖ
---
You speak as if Showdown is the only game mode in existence. I'm speaking in general terms here. Everyone knows Showdown is one of Shelly's better game modes.
---
That‚Äôs a bit inappropriate but could you include a picture please?
---
Well, it's a low-quality clickbait YouTuber. What do you expect?
---
Still don‚Äôt have Leon, been playing since day one
---
#SO MUCH

lol btw join: r/BringLifeLeechBack

You know it

I am so sorry cause you dont like it, but I know that if you can play in it, you would see how funny is it going to be

I know this is irreverent but I just created a subreddit and if u r interested in bringing back life leech jojn up: r/BringLifeLeechBack

I hope lol

YES SUPERCELL HIRE THIS MAN!

I can only think of two voice lines for Tara
---
‚ÄúWhat will your fortune be?‚Äù
---
‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs unfortunate.‚Äù
---
Why? Could you explain?
---
I thought you misspelled but then o saw you were playing carl
---
I couldn't bc this happened to my friend and he wanted me 2 post it
---
Thas on you for playing carelessly. Don‚Äôt blame the game creators for your lack of skill on there game.
---
After seeing Carl's voice, I'm not sure if I want Leon to have a voice.
---
In that case I don‚Äôt think people Will believe you because you need proof.
---
but shelly needed a big buff.
---
Ok you're probably right, I was just shocked when I saw that same skin concept with that same name as mine. Sorry dor that, and nice concept
---
Trail of tears
---
Btw best comic I‚Äôve seen!
---
But when you say uno, that means you have 1 card left. Or have you never played the game?
---
As a note, I will be releasing 3 more brawlers to see how you guys feel!
---
Wow really? I never knew you could do that, even though this is the 1001st time this is posted, thank you!
---
Yea true unless they have experienced it
---
You only have 115? That‚Äôs weird. You should have more by now. Anyways save up for the skins coming out. Or mega box
---
Im taking this down
---
its not lack of skill its bull in a bush
---
On what map did it happen?
---
*A girlfriend*  
---
EJem,leaving beside my jerk attitude id suggest you to keep it for either a leggie brawler(just got my first today at .2064) or either a skin you really like (dragon knight jessie is the best for me) Maxing the account and obtaining resources will probably consume you very little compared to what it costs to obtain the gems (60 for a megabox? a megabox is literally 3 days of normal boxes etc... and those gems will be gone for  months)
---
#BringBackLifeLeech (best event mod imo)
---
It's kinda like a 9/11 joke or a WWI/WWII joke  (which were also horrific tragedies)
---
It's less to invoke a laugh,  but instead have people recoil at the idea that joke of such bad taste has been made
---
Lol ikr
---
It's to match you with similar opponents, however Supercell uses trophies to match them.
---
But k have countless screenshots of how lvl 10 makes a difference. That star power they get at 10 does give them a big enough advantage where if you got 3 lvl 10s. It's going in their favor. I think they should add more weight to lvl 10 brawlers.
---
Check the bush, don‚Äôt go by the bush, break the bush, get better at the game. There are many options.
---
Everybody knows how to do it now because this was posted a thousand times before...
---
not always able to check
---
How DARE you. We are NOT in any universe controlled by bulls.
---
EELLLLL PRIMOOOO!
---
Make the picture of her with the glasses on with her signature glasses
---
I love the entertainment, we're lucky to have these selfless teamers provide a brilliant show.
---
Wow wp
---
If gene can only super the primo
---
He is actually called ‚Äústick‚Äù in the Italian version because he is as fragile as a stick
---
I love when that happens. As long as I'm the Gene.
---
Are your other brawlers at like 200 trophies üòÇ
---
Sorry formatting, uploaded from mobile.

Happy cake day!

Star Shelly was a limited time skin given to players who launched the game before Jan 1, 2019, so there‚Äôs unfortunately no way for you to unlock the skin anymore.
---
Where‚Äôs the dad
---
Awwwww they're so adorable!
---
Were you also aware that you can try out the Bunny Penny early?
---
... wonder if people actually look at posts here

the cathedral memes aren't really that funny cause its just some old building that no one cares about

I just noticed bcz I have music off and turned it on yesterday. I didn‚Äôt not know ): this was the best song
---
Shelley: oh so your coming to me
---
Primo: yes how else am I gonna get my super
---
I honestly think her silence fits her character the most. It really gives off the "mysterious stranger in town" vibe, but regardless, these quotes are great too :)
---
mortis
---
is forced to face check everything
---
low health pool
---
low damage

is countered by aimbot

low move speed

is mortis
---
Yup! And the way you avoided crow super is genius. I ‚ô•Ô∏è penny because of these moments.
---
Because he's Korean. Kotrans are crazy serious when it comes to video games.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs not the point i found a bug, the point of the post wasn‚Äôt about trying skins you don‚Äôt have
---
If you could get a new Brawler from the Daily Box, you wouldn‚Äôt have a pick of three rewards, it would just give you the Brawler.
---
Holy shit that must have took hours
---
The dog became the gun
---
To get 1 more trophy?
---
she doesn't need a buff to anything maybe a nerf
---
Looks like fortnite the season 5
---
Agreed! She/he is so underrated!
---
My chances of someone actually relating to this graph is less than the red piece.

it annoys how people use this template wrong...

I have two 16s and two 15s and the rest are like 12s

---
The point is this, and the penny bunny thing, have been posted about a 1000 times this week.
---
I have a hard time believing this
---
Yeah, agreed! I‚Äôve said that to a few other people who have said what if I misclick. That would be the only solution unless you couldn‚Äôt get Brawler drops from the Daily Box.

Me too, buddy, except mine was power 2
