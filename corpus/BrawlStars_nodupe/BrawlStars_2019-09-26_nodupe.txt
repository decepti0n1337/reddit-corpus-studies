Totally, I get it, and was pretty much messing around considering it's a meme. It's amazing what can be jumped all over on Reddit of all places lol. I'm not worried about it but yea, made this one first, I know they're legendaries.

I think it is but since most are his faces it's probably primo

Yeah I doubt this is intentional. It’d be like me saying every screw in my house looks like either a + or a —

I made a Duolingo Crow skin in my profile, check it out. I just saw this right now when I searched up Duolingo Crow.
---

---
They buffed Da Capo healing from 500 to 600
---
Prioritize Colt in my opinion his both star powers completely changes his build especially, Magnum Special
---
Probably both put that was pretty good

For the time being, I also have the highest rated [Nita](https://i.imgur.com/5pp1Lhm.png) as well!
---
Yea 50k star points is quite difficult to get. Also some people bought the crow skin instead.
---
Nita - Bear with me
---
Shelly - Shell Shock
---
El Primo - Meteor rush
---
Northern korea
---
Also prioritize Mortis his both star powers completely changes him.
---
You dont know jojo? Ha bakara

What app do you use to make these? I have one awesome idea...
---
You're missing nothing. It has been like this. The types of players you described have most likely lost their connection to the server and are automatically controlled by the game (until if they might be able to connect). They usually take few steps, shoot into random direction and may up in the nearest bush seeming not doing anything useful.
---
Rico be floating
---
Thanks,

So for the Star power brawlers, which one should I get it once I have enough gold or should I just wait until it drops for free in the boxes? If so(with gold) which one should I get with gold first. Not really keen on using 2000 to get but if it’s a game changer I might just have too....lol....
---
Nita-Bear with me or Hyper Bear / Shelly-Shell Shock / El Primo- Meteor Rush
---
Since these are the only ones I can get Star powers for as of right now.
---
I’ll work on getting Colt, Leon, Brock and Mortis leveled up when ever I can.
---
If a person scores their own goal three times or more, they should be not able to play for like 5 minutes or more like in clash royale.
---
Too much, I did not play at all yesterday. Maybe today.
---
Leon is the best brawler!!!☺☺☺☺☺☺😃😃😃😃😃
---
Tnx for using my loading screen!
---
Okay, well in any normal competitive game Ayers are penalized for dropping connection. I'd suggest Supercell add a timer where people can't play or a trophy loss each time.

No no no its Rico and Mortis

I guașă this happens if rejected it :l

so you're saying if i get robo retreat I'll have good randoms?

Dude that's me when I reached 10k and got nothing and I still don't have any legendary😢😢😢😢😢

Cool idea but too OP some changes and the starpower could come in the game

Bring it to SWITCH!

Imagine that i dont have the other cards like: mythics and legendarys

Memematic sucks, I can’t even change the size of the dang font, so I had to do this. Oof
---
I translated it obviously
---
Guess who?
---
You also coulda have shot the colt to stop him from dealing damage, but no matter how it ends, having 10 gems in the back just about always wins
---
Rico just has good starpowers in general
---
We still don’t like it.

This should be updated on the next brawl talk.
---
I don’t have it but I think I’ll be great with it cause I’m always low as Rico plus I 1v1d a Mortis in a friendly siege match and dominated him without regen
---
whtat
---
did you even watch the video
---
The Primo looks as retarded as ingame
---
Been playing since global and I'm maxed on everything. Including Sandy.
---
Small question...... Is this really 'Mortis x Colt' or is it 'Mortis killing Colt'? Cuz I think Colt is gonna drop dead on the floor pretty soon...
---
Tara and poco will be taco.
---
I think the 80 gems are justified bcs its more than just a recolor. It also looks pretty good imo. For example, white crow is just a recolor but also 80 gems which is too expensive, should be 30 gems or get a rework.

Bro I got my first star power at about 3-4K trophies and now I’m at 7.7k trophies with 8 star powers, I’m f2p btw
---
But it doesn't have much else, no effects or much change at all. A lot of other skins are like that, but Frank is on a 2D model so it stands out more that this skin is kind of worthless.
---
No US
---
I'm not gonna watch the hole video but i know it's awesome so i will give a upvote
---
Your rank basically gives you free trophies. Get good. 😒
---
I think you mean 20 power cube? 20 gems changed nothing bro, it just means there gem grab match has been dragging on
---
i like how the zip is half way down the vest but it is still done up. my zips always break XD

Bruh someone already did this I think you just copied it

Or Colt
---
So many people have done this we don’t need more
---
Lol so true
---
What's going on?

Oh nvm
---
lmao then they lied to everbody who bought them last year bc ut literally said 'cant be purchased after the offer ends' well played supercell

Bruh no one cares about these and this doesn’t make you funny

Hey. OP. If you reading this. I have an idea. Tara and Poco will be TACO

Ingame he looks fine in my opinion I got used to it

It might be boring but it’s not basic, panda Nita is basic for example, just some colour changes, but this the weapon is changed, the snake thingie and his hair is different

Crow and Pam would not equate to that though. You don’t get to just throw in a random U in the merge when they are literally people out their names “Cam”

That's actually genius

Bull as well.
---
In before this blows up like crazy
---
nope it wont work always . what if someone before you had done more than 30% damage by themselves already, so irrespective of the number of cubes you  have you cant do more than 30% damage , which means you cant win. jus because it worked one time doesnt mean it will work always
---
Crow and Pam would not equate to that though. You don’t get to just throw in a random U in the merge when they are literally people out their named “Cam”

Probably won't but that's a respected amount of positivity you got there..

Bull needs a starpower or way to interrupt his super manually. it's so fricking long and dangerous to use especially in late game showdown where the gas is close to the center
---
**Eventually, he stopped thinking.**

time to take care of the weeds

Have much fear: Mortis is here!

nah, then people always fight for kills, gem farming etc. theres a reason why star player doesnt get anything

Welcome to r/brawlstars

Mortis is actually "death's" in latin
---
Cute :3

that''s the dumb thing about randoms you see. They know nothing about defending the safe, but instead just charge forward, shoot at it, but die, leaving the only educated person (you) to try to defend.  THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU IGNORE STUFF, MAKE IT A L+LESSON LEARNED.
---
or piper cause he have a sniper in the picture
---
Cool idea but as someone with a needle phobia I might find this skin problematic :p
---
🙄
---
(I'd love to see crow when he is jumping like crazy and when he lands beside a adjecent brawler, he holds his needle and tries to sting someone)
---
Well, I don't know what to say except he'd probably throw them needles! Maybe like in a paper airplane style or something?!

If Bruce doesn’t get the star player I’m uninstalling.

You have replays unlocked?

Dont know, CAUSE ITS AN ALMOST EXTINCT SPECIE

... if you can only get him 650 and none more its because he's hard to play... and maybe gettin fhim rank 10 would help as well. And imo tick is hella fun to play too.

He literally commented a link to a video where he bought it and played some Solo SD to flex with it.

I think this was a stylistic decision made in the icon design and it literally doesn't matter.
---
I feel like it matters more for piper since the difference between black and blonde eyebrows is a little more drastic..
---
It looks great but with Jessie you would have to make a separate projectile for shocky
---
Poco is my boi because he is god tier at group damage in gem grab. At 3.5k trophies. Try it
---
 no um i was going for something like the inferno tower
---
Yes and projectiles also
---
Exept that even the Time stop brawlers teammates also can't move.

Why "water"

Your other comment is just trying to say it is a joke

Yikes you could of dies in that situation if that leon was smart but I was smarter, you guys are so dumb you say brain can wth and i never said that the super was the best i said that if i didnt super that leon could of killed me

Will take that into account. Until then, Mortis will continue his job as a grave digger and quarantine will be strict

I don’t know about that. El Primo is already about halfway to being Star Platinum.

Yurp so why is calling other people suck a joke then ? That is a insult

Nice

That's because I'm not referring to a single person but players underestimating dynas

Are you high or something? What a joke

 I know that mortis is not the best, actually he kinda sucks.Not saying tick is 0 skill , im just sayng that if tick just spams and  it works . Spaming is easy and boring, of course if u dive in to the enemy team u will die.

Me como mis mocos

We were dm’ed a month ago
---
Because it's a J O K E not an insult saying someone is a BrAiN CaN is an insult
---
Thought it was going to be Ni🅱️a
---
Do you often just repeat the same irrelevant nonsense while telling others how wrong they are and to accept it? Do you win many debates that way?
---
&gt;I have better things to do than sit behind a keyboard talking to the likes of you all day.
---
Sure ya do champ. Go find some new fan art that's been posted and comment how you're shaking for the millionth time. Such a funny and original joke. All the best.
---
It is 7.
---
Ehrenlos
---
Why is that a joke? That is a insult. “you suck at the game!” Is this a joke?
---
feel the power of brawl and beauty
---
Your other comments are just saying that an insult is a joke
---
R/Englishishard
---
I didnt say "you suck at the game!" I said "you underestimated dynas potential" which is another way to say lizards suck
---
Wonder why? All other game modes seem to work.
---
How do you fusion brawlers?, with adobe photoshop?
---
r/madlads
---
I hope she comes back tomorrow discounted to 500 gems because that's all I have it's alot to ask but I can still hope
---
Yeah, There are many examples out there but I tried to emphasize the mask while trying to keep true to Crow's original clothing
---
Yup. Still a star power. better than nothing
---
Also, nice skin!
---
I know, like that piper probrably thought the Bibi was annoying because she will steal the powercubes. Piper is not annoying for shooting her.
---
You need to charge youre super
---
It's named that because of........                                   3 meters tall grass

Fuck spike cries da man

r/unexpectedjojo
---
The last one whit the tips and tricks
---
all i did is correct ur typo lol
---
Bi#@h I got my second legendary (2nd last brawler) at 11000
---
30 gemz plis
---
r/imsorryjon
---
Yeah!
---
Ok thanks
---
Yes,I Agree.But it brings back the old memories.I was gonna post something like this that wasn't taken from Google but nevermind
---
I've opened 200 boxes at least and got no star powers when I need 9
---
Updated with some of the suggestions from the old post. This map is ideal for sharpshooters, but in the interior, heavyweights dominate.  
---
  
---
Just tried to create an idea which came to my mind today.
---
Is no one talk about the loading screen?
---
Wait,So are lying and trying to Karma Farm?
---
Thx
---
Well, it’s rude if you do so on an old comment. If you see it, just leave it like that. After all, nobody mentioned it when I first made this, so everybody understood what I meant, thus making your correction futile.
---
Like, imagine writing a comment, making a typo, and months later somebody corrects you. (I know it’s only 22 days old but still)
---
E D I T
---
Now that's epic.... photoshop
---
Did you even properly watch the video before saying it was 9 kills? It’s clearly 7
---
That's still too much. People can start on teaming on a brawler as soon as they find out who he/she is, it won't be so hard
---
PS: It's not serious, it's created at fun
---
*L*
---
So uh Lewis from Mystery Skulls.
---
Da heck Man 😂😂
---
Just get 5 power bricks with barley and Push the bot. gets me no1 80% of the time
---
r/expectedjojo for balance
---
Ah and i forgot this
---
Eyes of no human are YELLOW
---
No.
---
Sounds interesting. I would like to put that together and see how it goes. I'll let you know when it's live.
---
Hi ♥
---
This map is very fun to play, due to the space and the bushes
---
Tbf they were pretty big hp buffs, he’s in a good place now
---
*imagine replying to 2 months old post*
---
Ok cool idea but WHAT IS THAT ON THE BOTTOM RIGHT CORNER?!?!
---
hi little spike
---
Feels bad man.
---
That mortis was a idiot lmao
---
Unplayable!
---
Do you mean me or?
---
Wow, this is really amazing, i wouldn't be surprised if you would be editing for huge youtuber great work man keep up the good edits!
---
Sounds good and keep up the great work
---

You can’t use Reddit if you’re 10 years old. You might not want to post just in case you get banned
---
I do not play this game and I don't know if I want to
---

---
How become that command
---
Where are Piper's arms? 😅
---
yes,after get all power points you get more coin from box.
---

Conversely, a mechanic should be introduced where players can't kill other players. Power cubes still spawn and if the robot kills other players, then great, you pick up their cubes. But since the main objective is to kill the boss, then there shouldn't be PvP
---
r/eighthsub
---
Dude darryl is very good. Hes not built to compete with other shotgunners. Hes always been an assassin type that you role and and pick up a kill on a lower health brawler.
---
r/ninthsub

Again with this shitty circlejerk. DURRR INSTAPOOP BAD DURR ONLY I MAKE PERFECT MEMES WITH FONT THAT ISN'T ELONGATED my mom hates me
---
i am 10 k and still waiting for 2 power piper
---
Takedown is replacing siege as the worst gamemode.
---
clap clap cough cough
---
And they didnt even find it. Most were just photoshopped or googled shitposts
---
OK THATS ENOUGH

Why are you getting downvotes? It's the truth
---
No please
---
excuse me are you taking all the credit for yourself
---
Do people just forget you can buy a legendary with gems when they’re in the shop...
---
At least you get a star power
---
lmao nice home screen
---
Ok guy. Thanks for the information.
---
Oh, that's nito
---
*Would you smooch a ghost?*
---
So thats the guy that was auto aiming in my game
---
You will perish, just like Leon, Bull, Sandy, and Tara did.
---
That’s exactly what happened to me
---
I meant that they were closer together.
---
Smoke should go all the way out the screen, it just disappears after leaving the gun rn.
---
It's fun to get more tokens, plain and simple. 2 extra box openings per day are fun. That's that.
---
**NO**
---
The art is amazing, but I also liked the way you described his attack animations.
---
#no
---
r/youbrokethechain
---
Lol the new takedown map is called Mexican Standoff
---
[Weak](https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/cunaym/probably_not_the_best_time_to_post_this/)
---
That happened to me with Mortis but before trophy changes and got him down to 390 from 499
---
Except yourself, which, evidently you are.
---
am sorry if i was mean to you.
---
Idc if everyone downvotes, I sympathize because I have a similar situation but my bro has all legendaries (except Sandy)
---
Why is there 2 bibis lol
---
r/shittybrawlstars
---
Hello to future people in hot
---
You should start packaging and selling these. I would buy a pink spike in a heart beat!
---
This is something I noticed lol
---
Bull/Primo/Rosa - Actually plays Takedown properly; attack the boss almost all the time.
---
Piper/Colt/Rico/Barley/Crow/Bo/Brock - Try to 1v1 every brawler or team up with another long range brawler without attack them. But once they see a bull, all long range brawlers teams up to kill the bull.
---
These are the brawlers who's ruining the game mode
---
This is Takedown at 700 trophies...
---
Not really a leak those were fan made so someone just made a pumpkin spike as one of the parts for the video
---
Gene would break the barrels though...
---
Hi Spike
---
Fucking kids
---
teamwork is highly advised for this gamemode as well
---
Pay to win
---
A man of culture I see
---
Finally a person not posting fusions
---
I use Rico a lot and I only focus on the boss
---
He got sandy today From a box he Said it in the chat
---
That is differnet. Thats intentional
---
Ye but its techniques. Ull see more of that in higher trophies
---
I can't show all the brawlers in someone's profile
---
Then starting ag game will take forever to start if someone has bad wifi. We want quick, fast, fun games, not 10 minute waits.
---
Oh really. Preventing with a super instead of just a normal attack, which would give him more damage points, plus, Colt didn’t had any power cubes, when he had 4. I kinda see the issue here.
---
We all know who gedi kor is
---
Yesn't
---
Aren’t they different drawings? This one has lines in the background and the artists name, but the one you linked doesn’t have lines and is empty. Admittedly, they do look similar, but I don’t think it’s stolen.
---
Edit: oops never mind looks like they just edited the lines on there and the name
---
It'd look weird with purple eyebrows, thats just how the artists draws
---
The Ike bot can now see you normally in its circle. The invisibility working on the Ike was removed because it was too powerful
---
Pretty sure he gave up
---
good symmetry, good layout, I'd give this map a 10/10 would recommend
---
I don't check brawlers that I don't have
---
I was about to downvote this but I saw you credit the artist. Next time though, credit the artist in the Title
---
Go collect some power cubes then? And I never said that Brock was smart, it seems like they autoaimed the super
---
I WANT TO DIE
---
Is really nice of you to acknowledge that, even with you lost.
---
Is it a bad thing?
---
Students who didn't get enough sleep fall asleep in class and teachers go sicko mode on them
---
remember when everyone was complaining on how strong Pam was and now no ever talks about Pam?
---
I only kill other players in Takedown to steal their powercubes XD

how many trophies yall matching against?

I really liked the idea of the super reload
---
Oh gatcha, I could of sworn I saw part of the jotaro arc but it's probably made up memories
