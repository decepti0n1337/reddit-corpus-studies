My barley is at 1200.
---
Well played
---
Da fuq u mean doesn‚Äôt pack the damage output. 1260 x 3 = 3780 dmg in quick succession in a fairly wide area
---
what a way to end this
---
All of the brawlers you listed can work if the people playing them are good.
---

---
&gt;Why not ? On open maps and ***with skills*** she destroys everybody
---
Guys, I Swear that the next one will be better ok? This one just my first idea, I Can do it better :)
---
Downvote
---
Did you remember when it where no shield in showdown? It was funny when piper was added.
---
[deleted]
---
Like the enemy is near him and he attacks wall instead enemy
---
They lost cuz brock missed all his rockets
---
Shove some C4 up his ass before he gets away!
---
Also she hits every brawler in her range.
---
It looks like Bibi had her homerun and bounced Tic's head directly at Piper. 
---
Bibi was like: " hey Piper, catch"
---
Theres always the great feeling you get when you dodge the shot and the checker still doesn‚Äôt know your there, even better when they go In and you turn up and kill them.
---
Someone give this man a medal
---
Or when sandy exists
---
I'm pretty sure I do
---
Why im hearing madara in the distence?
---
Can you guys stop doing the same post all over again?
---
No I didn't miss it, I just wanted to make Barley just different in the art that's all. In the next art I will do that thanks for the tip
---
Insert Dark Souls Theme

No problem!

Well, I still don't have enough power points to upgrade mortis, I just unlocked him a few days ago. Mortis was always my favourite brawler so I played him a lot.
---
Yeah so I don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre trying to say.
---
I mean your tats was dumb but your crow set you up
---
Do it without a stun.
---
I love the idea!
---
What did crow even do other than suicide
---
Ok bud
---
Things changed:
---
‚Ä¢Custom Piper Model
---
‚Ä¢New Vampire accent voice lines(voice over of Piper's original lines)
---
‚Ä¢Her bullets are wooden stakes now
---
‚Ä¢When her Super activates, a cloud of Bats flies under her.
---
‚Ä¢Super Bombs are now Dark purple.
---
‚Ä¢Has an eerie fog around her.
---
how
---
how did you make one of the cutest brawlers even cuter
---
The point was I triple frank stunned
---
Dude, thats my brawl ball team when an el primo or a tank is near our goal. We spam all our attacks on them. Nice work.
---
Looks like something out of Touhou. I like it!
---
That crow was good though.
---
He supered into full health tanks how is that a good play
---

Too bad it's rigged, but then again so are brawl boxes /s
---
Turns out Sandy and Leon are Nita‚Äôs brothers
---
But what if its 10/11
---
The fur should be fur colored
---
Ye
---
Well, you know how tanks like Bull and Rosa are good in Brawl Ball? Those guys counter Mortis.
---
Ryan: WRONG
---
You will get nothing either way. Those boxes suck. I never got one valuable thing like a brawler or gems from those stupid things(I‚Äôm at 15k)

remember before they added aut aim? He was atleast two times more mobile but still was balanced.

In gem grab you could play him as a gem carier or a agro but now he has only 1 playstyle
---
dude, you could have picked those powerups easily. why did you hesitate?!
---
I thought it was Penny at first
---
So fitting for her. Hope this gets added into the game. Nice twist on the name

yes because a circle can turn out to be not symmetric, an oval, not even lined well. there can go so much wrong when drawing a circle

Yeah his stats are corect but some People can play mortis and this is my opinio.
---
I started playing since global release, and I have the skin. I am not a beta player, am I? Correct me if I am wrong.
---
I am playing as crow
---
I also hope the mods take action because he didn't only steal from me... if you check his profile, he also stole from other people and I don't want him to continue doing that
---
Maybe a lot of rage to get to top 1%
---
Tick is worse than Piper in Brawl Ball
---
Yeah right 
---
You mean you'll search for post and crop out tue watermarks for internet points
---
That‚Äôs still kind of stupid, since you won‚Äôt know whether you‚Äôll actually get that brawler.
---
What was exactly what happened
---
50/50 some good some bad. But better play some thing esle. Mortis have most pick but aslo have most losing rank.
---
let me give you some free advice: there are already like 5 people (including me) who have commented in a lot of your reposts, that you are an art stealer. So quit trying to act innocent and delete all of your reposts , before you get downvoted into oblivion.
---
I need this
---
There was also a Bee Tick. But credit the original artists next time
---
Yeah. But the fact is we both ramdoms and we all bad sometime.
---
Can you explain why I got downvoted? I was saying it's fair enough that you like takedown....
---
That was good use of template actually
---
No not really. I‚Äôm not that bad
---
Solo Showdowm. Lone Star. Well, it would just be boring if the game ends when one player dies.
---
Thank you so so much for informing me. I already reported it to a moderator and also posted to expose his theft.
---
He shouldn‚Äôt suicide into frank bibi and mortis at full health I know that
---
This makes sense(Rosa being Shelly's mum). Shelly's dad is Hispanic(El primo?!) so she went to live with him. He and Rosa got separated because he didn't care about the environment (and she's a botanist) all he does is smash stuff (with his super that can clearly damage bushes or plants generally)
---
That isn't work
---
Nah
---
stolen art
---
Yea that works
---
Wellllll- something is better than nothing :')

Hey thanks! It's doing alright for now
---
Downvote him it is repost.
---
Which Programm you use for painting this?
---
I'm thinking the same thing
---
Don't delude yourself into thinking this game has skills involved lol. Its literally luck to have favorable matchups and even more luck to get teammates thst know how to work with you. Skill is barely a factor
---
Idk what you would name it, but this is great artwork. I love the details
---
Downvote, he is reposting
---
Its been like that most of the time tbh
---
Thank you! I appreciate it! &lt;3
---
(Also, nice!)
---
Of course he is good...his tange is so unfair for a thrower type brawler. And basically in bounty and gem grab, you just spam middle...
---
Not bad either!
---
YOU ARE STEALING PEOPLE's ART
---
I use sl8ck boots
---
Can you tell me sir what needs to be improved or changed?
---
I agree takedown just sucks, stresses me out
---
You stole
---
You need one more 3 place for the missing üèÜ.

Your drawing is oo nice. I am sad he stole it. It's basically like a diamond getting stolen from your house
---
Blue rocket acts like a red shell from Mario Kart, and red rocket acts like a blue shell

At least you have Tara
---
A great nerf for him would be to decrease the range of the 3 bombs‚Äô detonation. Would not destroy him but probably balance him out because he is overpowered in most team game modes.
---
I hate people like this

Considering we got the Pie Barley skin and the Night Witch Mortis anything is possible to happen. (Really like the artwork btw)

Reposting is fine, good even as long as it isn't frequent. Not everyone sees everything that gets posted. The problem here is he is trying to pass art off as if he made it. If the post was just a meme that would be fine. Or if he just titled it "Found this on art and thought you guys would like it" and the post was a link to the pinterest page that would be fine as well.  
---
But saying "don't repost" is getting a little bit to far away from the issue.

damn i got taras shadow

This is probably also stolen

Amazing! Supercell NEED to see this. Awesome idea üòç
---
Dude we know you‚Äôre like 9 and stealing art for a couple freaking karma, just give credit and be on your merry way.... you‚Äôre fooling nobody
---
Sure, but the reason these people do this type of thing is to rile people up. All they want is to get people to make posts like this one and give them attention.
---
He could have just created a supercell ID account and get barley
---
you got hard teamed on in duos

I think that is penny!

Hopefuly thats why i also posted in coach corry submissions

I assume another stolen one

---
Well it's not like his opinion is the only right one. I personally disagree with lots of his tier lists, and definitely disagree HARD with his Tick rating. Indeed, Tick is really good in Cavern Churn, as well as in many Bounty, Siege and Gem Grab maps. For me as far as throwers go, Tick is just a bit below Barley but well above Dynamike.
---
Nice art. Err, comment. Nice comment.
---
Just some game design ideas, *never* limit a player's movement options it is never fun for the players and turns people off the game really fast
---
if i see her i will kill her instantly because she never has good trades and i will take her lasso/rope and i will catch a piper then i will kill her.
---
‚ÄòDo it with skillz‚Äô seems to be the default brawl stars answer. 
---
If I was getting skilled players, there would be no problem. The problem is stupid randoms deciding to play Piper/Crow/Gene/Brock/Barley in brawl ball and expecting any result other than getting flattened. I‚Äôm good at brawl ball, it‚Äôs my best mode and I wouldn‚Äôt use any of those because they‚Äôre at an automatic disadvantage in that mode.
---
True
---
Stop stealing art, u should get banned for this
---
Am I the only one thinking about the Blue Shell from Mario Kart when reading about the red rocket?
---
he will do it himself after finding out that he has -ve karma.
---
I‚Äôm not supporting him, are you retarded?
---
Everyone please DOWNVOTE the post right now
---
It's STOLEN
---
It do be like that
---
I see you found a troll
---
You probably somehow stole this too
---
Tick is very good cause the attack spreads and his super goes around
---
rico has one of the most annoying attacks and super, long range, bounces of walls 99% of the time i get killed by his super its from the fact that his bullets spread, and he covers soo much area, i think removing that bullet spread in his super would be buff/nerf to rico, making him land all shots that he aimed ( now even when it doesnt show that bullet will bounc off a wall some of them will hit wall and bounce, its annoying when you try to shot  through tight spaces and your bullet bounces off instead of hitting ) but will also remove that random bullets flying across map
---
Thank you!
---
All right calm down jesus I just wasn't sure if you knew he was an art stealer or if you were saying like all the art of each mode is slowly arriving
---
Yup everything of his is probably stolen art, his art is stealing art and putting it on his account
---
Hmm yes this is clearly cool trader man fron Resident Evil 4
---
His first post that is actually his wow
---
Nice

We'll see. In the meantime let me down vote anything you posted till now.

Shelly. Best range, super with tons of damage that can help you 2 shot tanky bralwers. Has less mobility but she doesn't relly need her that much.
---
Thieeeeef

When Mortis release this map not here

It was such a good gamemode..

This is the combination of star powers of colt and mortis
---
Sorry this happened. I left comments and down votted in your honor
---
SureüòÖ
---
sounds good. we can‚Äôt be everywhere :/
---
I prefer shelly too, because she easily shredds the tankier brawlers
---
Supercell, Give us Lhamas tourrets now!!!!
---
Especially under 300 trophies. A lot of them exists.
---
Love this. It would be awesome if she shoots a ball of sand as her main attack. And the turret spits to the enemy players.
---
Woah, nice idea and edit too. Well done!
---
Shelly bcz the star powers bull bcz the high damge and bush maps like cavern something darryl bcz of the some waht tactical ultimate
---
Not the hero we deserve, but the hero we need
---
Yea no. You would most definitely need to heal after killing 1 brawler, and after healing ; full ammo.
---
LHAMA!!!!!
---
XD
---
It's a really ***nice*** offer
---
Depends on the mode and map.  Darryl is better in many Heist maps than the other two. Showdown, Bounty, and Gem Grab is definitely map dependent for my choice between the three.
---
We would like it if you delete your account right now and die.
---
Idiot son of bitch what are you thinking stealing for karma? Plus your drawing is so obvious repost you should get banned actually
---
Almost all brawlers are good in different sircumstances and sorry for typos btw in not english
---
Can you delete your account? Dumb kid
---
Carl? Well that's interesting
---
No i dont have leon Im Asking
---
bruh moment
---
The main idea of this post is to act as a remembrance for Mortis's old range and not the map.
---
Of course he did lol how can‚Äôt you tell
---
r/ricogang
---
To be honest. Sandy's super is going to be nerfed. We all know that. She has a huge nerf coming to her. I don't think that the ideas are the same nor the effects. 
---
In this case, this brawlers functions as a turret, negating people where he stands when his ultimate is activated. Nonetheless I think that his first Star Power should either give him or his teammates the speed buff, not both. It would be too OP if he could give everyone and himself a speed buff for 5 secs. Also, an AOE speed buff that increases 20% MS is too much. If it is AOE it should be 10 or 12% if it is only Tellie's MS then 20% is more than fair.
---
All in all a great concept.
---
With band aid before nerf
---
What did he say
---
Lol op
---
Don't be a Bullshit don't be a Idiot for losing karma.
---
Idiot
---
Yes but some times darryl messes up his super badly in showdown
---
it's always a useful strategy if you are on a losing streak :)
---
We here to help you
---
And you get a free lead for killing her
---
Thanks
---
No you should not focus on skins but new brawlers when they come out

I know

No but when they do will be easy to get them

Supercell hate free to play players

You can get him free by making a supercell id acount
---
You Didn't bother to mention this yesterday Lmao sad
---
Me too

Lmfao now I'm really worried it'll happen with any brawler with a skin

Hey since you consider yourself drawing show us your progress try draw something let us help you haha

You PayPal me $300 dollars and i tell Supersell to give her to you üëåüëåüëåüëåüëåüëå

Take my upvote so hopefully Supercell can see yoir post and remove or even sue this gane
---
god dammit, cant trust anyone in here man
---
TRUE IN BRAWL BALL
---
Yes it does, the only reason why he was fine at brawl ball was because he could rush the goal at a massive speed. He cannot do that anymore and since he's got a slow reload speed he cant move as much either
---
Probobly super late, but I legit installed redit to ask this, is this for sale?
---
SO cool Nita is like ShamanüòÄ

The bs is not brawl stars its BullShit
---
Exactly, but as a person who mainly depends on randoms, playing mortis is basucally a suicidal mission as im not incredible good at the game.
---
I feel like this one could be a little culturally sensitive. not that I care.
---
She shoots da emeralds
---
he is a thrower counter which is not like Mortis or Darryl who die from tanks
---
Only the skin
---
how did you get this text style?
---
Sorry for my speaking
---
I have only pne star power on nitaüò≠üò≠üò≠
---
If the turret spits like in minecraft im buying it
---
what's surprising throwers on a thrower map?
---
Breehhhh I only have 5 sp *probably because I only spend gems on skins*
---
I hope so.. usually negative karma doesn't really teach them... they might be trolls

Yup:Leon:

Minecaft Skinssss, oh yessssss!!!! Take my upvote and do more of this stuff

Pick the brawler and immediately press play before the profile changes.

I‚Äôve spent gems on skins before but gave up with it after, I don‚Äôt think spending real money on boxes is right because it just takes time to get the skins yourself, I‚Äôm at 8500 with two legendaries to go, I enjoy grinding for brawlers

U want leon? Get 700 gems and buy him OR you can be patient. If you choose to do neither, quit the fucking game.

even if this is legit why tf would frank use his super to destroy boxes smh

The buff from his star power takes effect after spawning his super, and the buff will be removed 1.5 seconds after his super exploded or destroyed
---
It goes against supercells terms of service, dont, all accounts involved will be banned if this is carried out
---
So how do get super from teaming throwers and tanks that goes in to middle bush
---
Jessie looks ok 
---
But can we talk about scrappy he is a liitle alpaca
---
thx, I didnt know about this glitch
---
Teamers, amirite?
---
No. Ur the one who can not understand memes
---
*Scrama*
---
*made by the wandering trader gang*
---
Yes. He does a lot of damage and has a large area of effect.
---
connect to Supercell ID
---
Y. Nerf on damage maybe. At max level, each mine can deal 894 dmg if i were not mistaken, amd you are suppose to move in the field, so passing through all of his spammed mines is surely to happen and that's a ton of dmg. However he can't be aggressive if his enemies come close to him (he can be saved by his super sometimes)
---
This is the worst thing Ive ever seen in my life! Ugh! Get away from me man!
---
Cuz he is an autistic that things he is rly funny

I hope so

I only see brawlers from trophy road (bo, jessie, brock, dynamike, tick, nita, colt, bull, shelly, and frickin 8bit

Shut up.

Don't u see 69?

No, you unlock barley if you don‚Äôt have him

this kid says he spent 3 hours on it. what did you spend it own, cropping the watermark?

i have more skin than you... EVERY SINGLE ONE except for golden mecha crow and bo

Technically our shellys are in maintenance break for a year. Really

It could be more fun if the meta wasn't just kill stealing, cleaning up, etc. Everybody's been asking for a deathmatch mode for ages, they just need to fix it up a bit.

Sometimes I'm in the bushes and Shelly appeared out of nowhere, -SCARINESS 100-

LMFAO YOU DONT EVEN PLAY BS AND YOU STEAL ALL THIS BULLCRAP TO GET KARMA. PATHETIC

Missed opportunity for Tick Or Treat Bibi

It‚Äôs called smart tactics ;) nice, I feel bad for you not having all brawlers though

r/jessiegang approves

Hmm, u/lisa-kisa stolen idea

I came here from Kairos‚Äô post. I love that cosplay, hoping for more of them!

Yep I started doing that ever since I made an IG account :) You can see in my recent artworks that I put my watermark in the middle.

The soldier next to Jess looks high

hope you won't ship mortis x piper again if this gets added in the game.

i dont really like the ships

i like the simples, no ships, memes

All right. Thanks for the heads up

1.55% pick rate means Tick is selected 1.55 times every 100 games, or 1 time every 64.5 games.
---
61.3% winning rate means he wins 61.3 games every 100 he participate, or 1 victory every 1.63 games.
---
The chance of both events happening together should be the product between the two probabilities: once every (64.5*1.63=)105.135 games
---
r/downvote
---
yes
---
it's so sad how he cropped the watermarks off all of the original artwork. kids like this actually need to get help.
---
that will be 300 gems for 3 acacia saplings
---
im not the kind of a ''selfish'' person (im not calling people who get mad by this selfish) so i get relieved when i and the enemy die at the same time but get low rank (because i think how much they also hate it)
---
i know you dont like me because of this, idc if you dont.

Then you should get out of the basement.

Ummm this is bibi

Imagine if Carl could throw two pickaxes at the same time, that go on different directions. To counter that, he would have probably a 50-60% need on attack, but honestly the amount of DPS you could pull off would be so insane.
---
Wow nice skin real ?

Oh. Sry. Probably damage dealt, number of deaths... Isn't random for sure.

I haven't think about her super yet i guess her super attack will be her candy basket what do you think?

I'm really Sorry But The Mods Are Lazy And (Probably) Won't Do Anything :( Don't Downvote Me, It's The Truth

Is your mind screaming free karma when you see these reposts or frick go away reposters

That should be banable.

No i made it myself thats why my share button is messed up, i made it on my phone btw
---
the only brawler at level 9 that I have is Dynamike and I'll need to upgrade more brawlers to 9 then

but it was posted before

Yes, one important thing, don't pull a bull

F for that mortis

I reported this post for spam, altough if impersonation or others copyright could be chosen to report as, it would reference this post as a **big fat fake**
---
One tip, don't use him on solo showdown.  I think duo the best or gem grab.
---
The Leon peeped around that corner and watched a grown heavyweight monster get birthed, what do you mean. Of course he would reconsider putting his ball in the goal. Obviously. üòÇ
---
Please make this a real skin
---
She'll shoot out giant emeralds and small emeralds too?
---
BC THEY'RE RIPPING US OFF
---
I'm just not an 11 year old kid who loves stupid memes.
---
thanks for the best tip ever
---
Indeed my friend!
---
What bullshit?
---
Same bruh
---
That dynamike saved it
---
Removing the power cubes from that game mode may fix most of the aggressive plays

Ok thanks ill play duo then because rn the gem grab map is bad right now or i just suck

Please delete it. You shouldn't have done this. Yesterday he talked how stealers stole his Brawl Halloween art and that he and many others may stop drawing brawl stars related stuff due to that. If you don't wanna get known as a stealer please do that. If you have some respect and morals delete it and repost it without the logo.
---

Ooooh, you got destroy!

A Singapore 10 cent coin. Ok

Okay I'll rip you up ._.
---
Go f*ck yourself
---
They should probably remove power cubes from that game mode so that people will focus more on the boss
---
The skin idea came from GEDI-KOR
---
She sells bad stuff, like the wandering trader from minecraft
---
I know right! It‚Äôs so annoying when people religiously go after you.
---
Personally, I don't see the points of skins. You pay a hundreds of gems just for a..decoration.
---
Event tickets and token doublers on the other hand are a pretty good value when they are on discount (they are good without the discount itself too).
---
Well at least she‚Äôs way cuter than the minecraft trader
---
At least hotter
---
just connect to supercell ID
---
That's not teaming, they weren't spinning and only attacking you, just cuz both of them were hitting you does t mean they're teaming.
---
Yes he was
---
I call gemmet
---
Wow, thats cool bro! We are p2w brothers
---
Nword
---
Why
---
if u want 2 I don't like this skin maybe save up for loaded Rico when it gose for discount
---
Luck. You just sat there until you were in showdown and the mines killed Bo not you
---
reposter: repost
---
original: ah s\*\*\* here we go again
---
Something to do with how replays are recorded. It would take a HUGE overhaul of the replay system for it to support download, share or replay control features and unfortunately supercell is incapable of doing so.
---
omg so relatable
---
nah it's jessie, 8bit and frank rolled up into one
---

But he was caught
---
Most probably is your random's friend
---
Lmao, I think you're the first person to acctually get the joke!
---
not sure if people are worried about exposing their troll accounts.
---
That's true. Also most of the times I have to ignore the power cubes around the map so that I can get to the boss faster
---
What he means is animations and model improvements and they did get that in the 8-bit update
---
It could be either I think
---
I'm just saying, be content you have one of them when there are beta players who have 18k trophies without one.
---
whats whit the coin?
---
I‚Äôm 11k trophies and have all brawlers except sandy. Only maxed 6 brawlers because I get no coins from boxes.
---
oof
---
WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK I just said there's no chance that there won't be a Shelly in Cavern Churn why u act like an asshole?
---
Do not ever open any boxes again, just let this account exist and make a new one
---
I got banned! I JOKINGLY said I stalled for time! I didn‚Äôt stall for time! Anyone with a brain would know it was a JOKE! It‚Äôs like banning a rabbit! The rabbit did nothing wrong! 
---
lol you probably won‚Äôt get the reference, but that‚Äôs what this reminds me of. I probably seem really weird right now.
---
Very nice , thanks so much for putting your suggestion. I am currently in the middle of episode 3 . I hope to upload it in the next 48 hrs
---
Keep the ideas coming it definitely helps, this is not easy at all XD
---
Try uninstalling and reinstalling the game
---
I talk about frank üòÇ
---
This needs more upvotes. This is great!

This ia so good! I made a similar concept, but yours is so much better! Keep up the good work!

Thought it would be a cool name for the map

how much times a shelly killed me:

Cya and have a nice day &lt;3
---
really? i thought it was just another brawl stars mod
---
it would not be the first hour I have this problem for a long time and I do not play in small trophies I play in rank 20 520 trophies
---
today is the worst day
---
You guys have brain ?
---
U forgot about pams turret. She can be under that aswell. Cool.
---
Yeah, just because he switched the colors doesn‚Äôt mean that these communist ideas are acceptable here.
---
Tara + Tick, that scared me lol
---
never happened and will never happen only if bull afk
---
is talking to teamers
---
You guys have microtransactions ?
---
Hats off to this guy
---
hh i hope not repost
---
I think that these brawlers stay out of bushes and the shotgunners kill each other off. That's why their winrate is higher.
---
Only if winrate takes into account getting 4th place and above.
---
I have 2 Star Powers for Mortis Shelly Nita Bo, and one for Jessie. Yeah i'm a pretty lucky guy
---
Well, as I understand it, you definitely do not respect my work. Although I spent about 6 hours creating it and another hour of rendering. As you can see, I deleted the post already 3 hours ago, but you still call me a lycimer and tell me all sorts of nasty things.
---
And I also want to say that the "Brawl Halloween" logo can be made in PixelLab in 10 minutes, if you have the font Nougat_BS
---
–æ–ø–∞ —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–µ
---
That‚Äôs a possibility too
---
Someone that actually had the balls to say this in a subreddit full of normies. Have my upvote, you deserved it. **Careful, he's a hero**
---
Me and a Jessie just let eachother do their thing, I got 1st and the Jessie got 2nd
---
Heck Tick : hectic haha I do the funny
---
That face worek on it next time but I linkƒô tour art
---
A 2 am sketch, feedback and criticism welcome!
---
That‚Äôs conveniently above the number I said. Piper is a silly choice in brawl ball - she is very easily killed and the mode is based on close quarters fighting. I‚Äôm sure there are one or two who have really, seriously got it down - but they‚Äôre the exception. 
---
Seriously if people stuck to brawlers that are good in BB like Frank, Shelly, Nita, Bull, Darryl and avoided squishies, they‚Äôd see their win rates go up dramatically. The vast majority are simply not anywhere near skilled enough to play Piper in that mode, and even then she is at a disadvantage from the start in every match.
---
ha! NORMIE!!!!
---
Yeh
---
PLEASE MAKE THIS SKIN (BITTE MACHT DEN SKIN)
---
F-word
---
Quality teamwork right there. Great comeback.
---
We have enough purple turban/hat brawlers
---
Ya ves bro
---
The bull was so funny
---
Caca in spanish means poop
---
Literally 20 people or something contributed to its creation but yeah it took them 10 minutes. You may not understand how they made it lol. If it's so easy, come on do it in 10 minutes.
---
*Nice screenshot*

r/shittybrawlstars who cares if this happens
---
Fgjtgb

He never said that it was his

So... where's Shelly?

Ban him from the subreddit it is all he has done

Shelly is like a creeper. She's made by mistake. üòä üòä

Go to the past and buy loaded rico with 30 gems.
---
Who cares r/shittybrawlstars and r/mildlydogpenis
---
Leon's one of the best brawlers for the meta right now
---
really minecraft skin?
---
Lol beacuse using a logo doesnt mean its copied we care about the skin not the logo dummy
---
You guys have internet?
---
Because when new year colt brought back nobody cared but when something that looks a little bit like star shelly everyone speaks out.
---
It looks like you are the Colt.  This person posted the same video ?

Darryl already has a remodel
---
Probably because someone played a high brawler with low brawlers, matchmaking matches you with similar trophies of the highest brawler in the team. So that way people can‚Äôt rig matchmaking to get High trophies
---
Super cell ID?

Sure I‚Äôm extraordinarily interested

What about Energy Drink and 20 Powercubes?

You guys are getting Gold?

I do it only to get as much as powerpoints as possible to beat high score

Its fun when you can 1 shot boss with 30k hp left
---
why did anyone downvote you, am i missing smth
---
post matches game experience
---
I only thought about it after I saw the llama
---
The colt skin was never for new year, it was just released at that time, you see on the brock skin it shows that it was exlcusive but it never did that for colt, supercell never said colt was exclusive
---
Remember this playing since beta
---
''stingy people'' bruh you dumb as sh\*t they won't add the skin becuse they would have to pay the company that made the character that ths skin is supposed to copy not because they don't want to support other companies lmfao

It's because shelly and bulls have a high pick rate and they almost always go middel which kils a lot of them which makes it so these brawlers hav a higher win rate also they probely barely win

Decided just to make a simple map!

Actually I just forgot to credit

I'm gonna get downvoted to heck for saying this but she does tho...She's the worst rare brawler and honestly trash without her super.
---
This is not even funny
---
Repost wth
---
Thats right but its red wizard not purple wizard :/
---
No time to explain
---
I would like zombie
---
I‚Äôm probably not gunna do that for a while since I‚Äôm busy with school. For these sketches it only takes 20 min tops. Maybe in the summer I can get started on it
---
What i mean is: if you play agianst a blue wizard barley, you will see its shots red because of the team colour (you are blue, enemies are red). You cant make your own barley shoot red orbs because you could confuse your teammates. So you could change it to a different colour for yourself, like purple, to make it different. See what I mean?
---
The Leon was likely teamed with the Bibi and the MM is based off the Bibi's trophies.
---
I like it
---

---
Wait what is Bruce?
---
sandy is weak without his super and star power
---
Well this primo is really *sad*
---
Wait, really? Is Rosa really THAT bad? I was always knowing her as the 'best rare brawler' because El Primo is pretty fucking awful, Barley is kinda hard to use and Poco is only for support
---
Its not fucking brawl stars you idiot
---
Oh look the minecraft wandering trader was such a cool thing they made it a thing in the real world, and then they put it in brawl stars
---
Idk

If you use lwarb can you get banned from brawl
---
‚ÄúI gave statistics and damage values clown‚Äù
---
Wrong sub
---
Edit: and just saw you posted this 3 times
---
Everybody down vote. Make his/her karma go negative. If anyone else reposts, they will be tracked down and down voted until they have negative karma.
---
He wrote stats wdym dude
---
I don't think that's true. Brawl stars can't detect you using a third-party mod app because you're not connected to their servers but lwarb's servers
---
Also if you look closely at Jessies waste, a spike appears below her. It's quite hard to unsee after that
---
My first brawler apart from trophy road was barley.
---
EL PRIMOOOOOOOOOOOOO
---
I agree shes rlly strongk rn tbh i feel dirty using her
---
Lmao that happens every time I go for a trick shot‚Ä¶
---
Ok thanks
---
Yeah, but what if you somehow already have all 4 legendary brawlers?
---
gotcha thx
---
aight
---
Bruh this post was on instagram. Is this even you?
---
Exactly
---
 200-400 gems if  you have all.
---
I‚Äôve been maxing roughly one brawler every week. I only have six brawlers left that I‚Äôm missing power points for, so I get gold relatively quickly. Granted my drop rates for star powers have been really lucky recently (about one per 20 boxes) and that can cut off at any time, but at the rate I‚Äôm getting gold now I should easily have every brawler at least power 9 in 6 months, and realistically I should have about 10-15 of the 41 star powers from pulls and a few more from the shop.
---
Of course, in that time, probably 3-5 new brawlers will be out. I probably won‚Äôt have the two most recent up to 9 yet.
---
I‚Äôve played just over half the time you have, so for you to have less on your account than I have on mine I‚Äôm pretty sure you‚Äôve just been really unlucky.
---
Well planned comeback my friend. 10/10.
---
Let me remind you it's you asking for the speed buff not me so remind me who sucks.
---
No. Stop asking for free stuff. If they did this they would lose out on money demand if they have no money they cant run the game anymore
---
Downvote brigade: **COMMENCE**
