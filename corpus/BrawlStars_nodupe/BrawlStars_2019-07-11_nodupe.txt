if you were born from 1981-1996 you‚Äôd be a millennial, so it‚Äôs unlikely this even was a millennial dumbass

What the hell man, how did you not die?

Nah, just got 4k. Not a pro
---
how long did you play?
---
#Where are the bats going?
---
Thanks. That's what I was going for.
---
As a soccer player ill tell you that it really is but ill also agree that if you r playing amongst friends and all of them with no shoes then yeah is better but of not then no cuz you can get hurt actually
---
Thanks a bunch!
---
so only one or two people will get it? or is this available for everyone?
---
ok but this is plain disrespectful to frank and ryan, at least say supercell or something instead of their names dude, idc if this comment makes me lose karma this is just outrageous at this point, at the end of the day, the game is supercell‚Äôs, if u have problems with it, dont disrespect these hardworking people and stop playing. easy.
---
Thanks so much
---
lol

It isn‚Äôt. He probably thinks that all 8 will always spawn mid.

I know what you mean, but the matchmaking IS based in Trophies, not in Levels.  
---

---
Brawler level doesn't mean that the player is actually good, its just means that he is 40% stronger than you.
---
Is it unfair? Maybe, but it's not illegal for you to max a brawler and then make a mess at base range trophy.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Supercell could change the matchmaking to fit this new demand? Of course they could, but why, they're at the same "experience level" of you guys?
---
Matchmaking really sucks by now, but at my sight, it's completely fair.
---
I'm not here to criticize you, just look at the big picture, level means nothing but power, if you can't control it, its useless.  
---
Remember Uncle Ben's last words.
---
P.S. Even if you're powerfull, you can always be destroyed by a LVL 1 PrO pLaYeR. Precision, Movement and Position is EVERYTHING in this game.

It's different from computer or smartphone but pratically you just need to go on the subreddit (ex: r/brawlstars) then on the options you will find "user flair" then select yours and its done
---
Yea one random helped me to get 300 trophies and i also helped him. And im still waiting to him to accept my friend request
---
Yeah.  No hats team to much.
---
it looks great, but i feel like the transitions between brawlers could be smoother.
---
This looks like a repost.
---
Yeah but when I try actually playing mortis as an assassin it seems extremely hard to actually walk up to the people to kill them.

You‚Äôre probably at lower trophies and playing with bad players.  It‚Äôs one of the best heist maps in the game rn.

I know what you mean, tho.  Games on my 3000 mini account are like that, but not on my 10K main.

I can see where you are coming from. There was a video discussing why genes nerf made a big impact in ladder and tourneys is because that long range was key in gem grab. If you had a gene on your team you would almost always win if they didn‚Äôt because of the fact you could pull there gem carrier to your team after getting a few gems and then taking theirs, thus you have around 8 or 9 and if it‚Äôs late game you could have many more. The only way to really counter a gene is have everyone carry gems but then you have no one who can ‚Äúsuicide‚Äù or risk dying and you can‚Äôt have one person retreat with all the gems, instead everyone needs to hold their ground and if anyone dies, the team loses 1/3 of their total gems. This is my opinion and I‚Äôm getting sick of saying don‚Äôt get mad so please don‚Äôt get mad lol

Wait what is he saying. I speak Spanish but I only understand bits and pieces.
---
I got the same conclussion, my gf and friends play less (3k &amp; 5k) than me and already have gene, tara and at least 1 legendary.
---
the randomness is comedic tho
---
Lol looking at a powercube

I think ur forgetting that you won‚Äôt have enough coins to upgrade Frank I‚Äôm the first place but F anyways

gem grab equivalent of tiny showdown

P.s I'm not saying that crow is bad I'm saying that crow is overshadowed by spike and leon (nerf spike?)

Why did you put on a filter

Low key the mega boxes on trophy road are all disappointments.
---
‚¨ÜÔ∏è
---
I was thinking about that! It will be so cool to just dash around the map with infinite ammo!
---
Wait... that's illegal
---
Then why did they get star player?
---
But there‚Äôs nothing wrong with that. Top players come and go, we don‚Äôt worship them. They just find a new game and spend $500 on that instead.
---
    The circle of mobile games my friend.
---
Star Player doesn't mean you're good
---
Skin idea: unthicc pam
---
i am 10k and no legendary or mortis. at least i have crow on my second account. congrats btw
---
Just not the best strategy
---
you can get 1k max exp per day
---
It‚Äôs not that it would be solely based on power level, but if the matching making has picked 6 randoms based on trophy levels already, dontpair all the level 10s again the lower level people. Mix it so average power levels are the same on both teams to at least give a fighting chance.
---
LFMAO Good meme dude!
---
I like this concept.
---
Lmao what else does Supercell want you to do? They don‚Äôt get richer with you being free to play!!! Continue with the F2P brave soul
---
LMAO
---
That makes the skin unavailable to anyone who's not maxed out then. Not everybody who likes the old Rico is willing to wait.
---
Shelly was just stronger in general than your Shelly, bo is crazy on that map, piper is a bit more difficult but has potential. You'd have to be quite a bit better but it's still possible

If ya dont mind, i will post it on my yt channel

I presume it was in the game files, they add it in so its easier to add for the new update. And the maintainence breaks are shorter rhan it needs to be because of this

Sure what‚Äôs it called, I‚Äôll check it out

don‚Äôt worry, I alredy downvote him

This is why I always say power level should be a part of matchmaking

He is actually there, and not just as a "haha invis," but you can tell that he's there in one way or another.

...I lost trophies because of this. Trust me on this one.

Nope she is in india, someone had the india dictionary and searched for NITA amd the result is bear

Thanks bro, but feels bad for him.

No.... I meant at the end screen, it did not say you lost trophies meaning it could have been a friendly game

its really good in brawl ball with one tank and one long range

Oh I see what you mean yeah I forgot about putting that as proof, but this was a real game,  i soloed with randoms and I don‚Äôt know any of these guys, I‚Äôll take a quick screenshot and put it up

No no no, it's fine. I believe you sorry for questioning

Again just like what happened with Crow and everyone saying he needed a buff, Mortis is just a bit more skill based, yeah Pam is a bit of a switch blade in a lot of scenarios but if you time a mortis‚Äôs shots right you can damge most of the damage from her and his high health pool, damage and speed allows him to take out throwers without much trouble except maybe tick, he can take down low health characters such as rico and crow before they can kill him and characters that have weaker hits, like Poco and nita(the bear will counter him though), and characters with a longer attack animation like Colt and pam which he can dodge and go in for damage. Speaking of which his attack gives quite a bit of dodging potential against a lot of attacks and retreat ability. His super‚Äôs regen and range can take out a full team and is really good with certain comps, while he isn‚Äôt too good in Solo Showdown unless there‚Äôs a lot of throwers, he‚Äôs great for bounty, duo showdown and brawlball

Well if your are good at robo rumble then focus on tickets is not buy tokent doubles even if you dont get brawlers you will still hekp progress your account

I got him to 600 at rank 6 lmao

You all are desparate. Let fucking SC on their break. They can't do anything in one update, Siege was changed for casuals and you all cry. The throphy increase was for people getting to 500 and beyond for Star Points, people said that it got inspiration from Zimbabwe. You all do not even have patience?

Shut up Mortis üåö

He's an assassin because his health is lower than the rest of the tanks.

Ok

I've literally seen 6 Top Hat Mortis'es team, not like there were any throwers anyway.
---
I‚Äôm just curious what makes yours any better?
---
You can press the "Help and Support" button on the Brawl Stars settings menu
---
mortis is only good at defeating teaming throwers
---
other brawlers not so much
---
Gta 5,really?
---
I'm talking about the post, why are you brining my posts into this? it isn't gonna help.
---
First of all, the title and image are barley even related.
---
Second of all, it doesn't make any sense, like, what the fuck.
---
Its sooo true

Of course, dislike everything with your fucking bots and you, just because you add 1 word to a template. If you actually intended that to be funny, I would just post the template by DarrylDumplings.

Come on guys this is Iwarb (a private brawl stars server) it's not real

If there is a big gang war going on and Supercell will add an update about it I will call it the ultimate showdown

COOL! GTA 6?üòÇ

Doesn't he say for vain or for glory

What are you talking about?

i feel you
---
Sad ;-;
---
Wait thats illegal!
---
I have every brawler except Mortis and spike is by far the least consistent
---
XD
---
Well,its your opinion,but Spike is more of a Harasser than the one who will finish the job.

After Darryl's wood fired grill, we have Dimebag Darryl's wood fired grill

And i'm gonna loose a lot of karma by saying this

I think you will get featured in some kind of "OMG FUNNY GOD BRAWL STARS MOMENTS NOOB VS PRO VS HACK VS GOD MOMENTS FUNNY"
---
True that.üëÅüëÖüëÅ
---
No problem!
---
U at 1k trophies or something?
---
Leone or Rosa are next.
---
ouch...
---
Lol
---
There could be a chance it could be randoms because in higher level trophies matchmaking is longer than below 300 matchmaking. I've faced up against an organized team as a random team and I got a 300 nita when I was using 500 piper (on my alt)
---
It looks good, but will it work for a loading time below 2 seconds?...
---
That moment when you are a 700 max level gene and go into random duo showdown and get a level one 400 colt who has no idea what he is doing
---
The trophies though
---
Hype!
---
When you do stupid shit in real life and have to post it to reddit because it's "funny"
---
Bonus is gems, tickets or doublers which aren't shown together with coins, points etc.
---
thats way to close to each other

bruh

With Mortis i only team with a fellow Mortis just to charge my super then i lure him into a trap bc Mortis players are stupid
---
bruh ü§ôüòúüëèüò§üôå
---
I highly recommend upgrading one to 9, so that you can get its star power.
---
How the fork you made so much ideas in just some minutes?
---
I would agree to get coins based on your kills. This could reduce camping. If you get for the other players kills, you could still camp and with luck kill the last one and get the coins.
---
Eh I personally think he doesn‚Äôt need a voice. Ya know., after what happened to Tara... anyways skins would be great
---
Mr.Bat want you to stop with the 69 jokes

Poco was my first 500 too! Leon was my second, currently working on Crow.

GOOD JOB MAN, IT'S A-MAZING.

its easier after the update, as lots of players are pushing 1 brawler rlly high while lacking experience.
---
Or cancel? 49 gems only
---
Supercell buffed his super

Lol.

N U T

2 minutes is too short

GTA: PLAGIARISM!!!!

Ok.thx

I cannot find this menu
---
Mortis means death... In latin...
---
HOLY FLYING COWS, I BEG SUPERCELL TO ADD THIS, I FREAKING LOVE IT.
---
u/Ryan_Supercell you must see this.
---
A bad 2 days to be exact
---
I love it! The drawings are so simple yet look so cool.
---
I got the sams box but brock instead of piper
---
Niice it got added. Good job man.
---
Thx your the reply
---
Yes XD
---
BUFFet Mortis üòâ
---
I mean I needed the brightness to highlight and see things more clearly. Dark mode for contrast
---
Niice.
---
sPoKe
---
And then... At the 3rd episode they reveal a leon skin!
---
Of cource ;)
---
Whatisthis ?
---
Since when dose Poco have a third star power?!?!?! Since any brawler has a third star Power?!?!!!
---
NIICE, it's so cozy.
---
Yea thats what i asked when that short came
---
Ikr.
---
Well that is impossible I think. The only reason to use poco on heist is to support a tank like bull or primo. And when a bull is at enemy safe he deal tons of damage. So probably the tank will get star player.
---
 can I share this great animation in my video? thanks!
---
Looks like a gargouille. I thought it's a new skin concept lol
---
Nice map, hope it gets added.
---
Who tf puts TTV and Youtube on their name lmao
---
Same
---
What BGM?
---
Aaaand the best camper award cooomes toooo: Brock
---
About profile...do I have a brawler next to my name? Or do I have to put one, because I have no idea how it works
---
OMG, HOPE THEY ALL GET ADDED. UWU
---
Bulligga
---
yes
---
Don‚Äôt you mean first thing that came to your mind? Lol
---
For touchdown map
---
Lol where do y'all get this
---
o  no...o no no no no
---
i cant edit!
---
Yes. He can be really annoying, but at the same time it is frustrating to use him because of all the factors like his health.
---
Thank you for continuing my sentence :))
---
No. Either godly or rainbow, but thats a lit name too.

Sorry for bad edit. Editing a picture on a phone is fucking hard.

Mee too
---
Ok...no need to flex.
---
Mortis
---
That's true, hope to max him out soon. He really needs that SP.
---
I know
---
Lmao XD
---
Its like buy 10 dollars at a cost of 5 dollars
---
Pee Pees
---
why this is in hot?
---
Try to update your game! We've released an optional update that should fix this issue. :)
---
Im from M√©xico and for the cloths, i can say the taco's local is in the capital
---
I don‚Äôt get it this is just a picture of you losing 1 game, unless that‚Äôs all it was supposed to be?
---
No it doesn't have the black outline
---
nice idea
---
Have you not updated? What do you use to still play what the game uses to look like?
---
Yep ur right about the first one, and reload speed seems okay as to not make it as OP as Bibi
---
No,Mecha era because there will be Mecha Crow and Mecha Bo also fighting with the others brawlers to stop Robo Spike
---
Bro im not flexing im just very confused and surprised ;-;
---
Rico‚Äôs pull out game strong.
---
My team: dynamike and tick
---
The other team:CrEaTuRe oF ThE NiGhT
---
More like get all brawlers to 600? 14,500 trophies is only 537 per brawler.
---
They said they will add boxes to the star shop
---
Ah I see I was confused because I couldn‚Äôt spot any trophy differences either
---
Is nice
---
You can add one on some programs (like Photoshop).
---
Congrats! He‚Äôs one of my favorite brawlers, loved him too much that I did push him to rank 20 2weeks ago

cool
---
r/unexpectedtf2
---
I miss ShellShock
---
Thanks, what power lvl tick you have when you reach rank 20? His really good, because of the attack range.
---
That is too broken. It‚Äôs definitely going to get removed from the game.
---
I said nightmare for how hard it's gonna be to get it.
---
Imagine this map with those "pistons" that would throw you back, making it harder to you to get to the end. Also cause if someone scapes from your sight u wouldnt be able to catch it..
---
Teaser: https://brawlstarsconception.fandom.com/wiki/Alternate_Star_Powers_(Jiawhien2015)
---
I will reveal these brand new star powers with new mechanics for the game shortly after. If you can also guess what these 27 star powers does in the game then you will get **3 more premium awards**, rarity colors does not corresponds to the brawlers' rarity.
---
u/Brawlstars u/LexMobileGaming u/Ryan_Supercell u/Frank_Supercell  u/Coach_Cory u/KairosTime_Gaming
---
Me be confused
---
Go to r/brawlstarsrecruit for this shit
---
What?
---
Tank in meta is when poco realy shines lol. Tank being out the meta is actually poco's problem. He is a great tank support.  The only tank in meta right now is Rosa. That is why poco is not very goon on tierlists. If bull,primo, frank, mortis, Darryll was in the meta right now everybody would complain about Poco being OP :P
---
See? Crow is worse than mortis so if mortis needs buff Crow deserves it more
---
anyone remember when the bear and turret had health decay?
---
I only enter to play Fute-brawl. When haven't Fute-brawl I leave. It can be a good alternative while Fute-brawl is in countdown.
---
#yes
---
look at band, isnt it supposed to be ban?
---
Fun fact he would‚Äôve been even more OP because his range is shorter therefor the attack animation is faster then Bibi‚Äôs
---
Oh... yeah
---
70: secs
---
Brawlers: *Stop*
---
*Jazz music stops*

#*Megalovania plays*

After that I will use penny hide next to crate lol

I'm sorry I don't speak expired ass noodles

Jokes on you, this is the second post i‚Äôve seEn

I recommend to you save your account with supercell ID, later uninstalling brawl stars and install it again

?

One word: 
---
Throwers
---
Ahhh that is too easy.
---
No we need to beat Mortis up first!

Ask Piper. Many people ship them

Excuse me wtf

 You could weak a rabbit‚Äôs foot, I head that helps. Of course, don‚Äôt cross a black cat‚Äôs path or walk under ladders, that‚Äôs a bit no when it comes to increasing luck.
---
is that an ##iFunnt WaterMark## üî´
---
I tried to even it with the health.  Crow does as much as him but has more health
---
There is an optional update for this, Frank said it
---
Welp i have a black cat
---
YeaüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
There‚Äôs no reason.  It‚Äôs all your device.
---
Fucks sake, those skins are expensive. Do you really think they'd spend the money to buy skins for every person watching the stream? And how would that even work? Would everyone need to register with their PayPal or whatever beforehand to recieve the money?
---
"Appear random" is a total lie.
---
There's a reason why everybody gets the same deals like skin and brawler discounts on the same day. Also sometimes you get deals that cost more gems or gold than you currently have, in order to manipulate players into purchasing gold and gems.
---
ü§°

I‚Äôm not sure honestly it‚Äôs what i wild hear
---
*cries in bad RNG*

---
I think it‚Äôs their servers.

I‚Äôm not saying that it‚Äôs bad to hide in bushes but there are people who only do that and try to get high placement.

Your device is the issue

Still dont have enough so im getting all 27 of my brawlers to power 7 or 8 then Pushing to rank 15 then Power up to 9

Bull and Shelly tryhards will love that middle bush
---
Not kidding, you will have a legendary 5 mins later
---
It‚Äôs cut off, I‚Äôd put the entire screen on the picture but my phone couldnt screenshot the top of the picture as well, which is why it‚Äôs somewhat cut off at the top as well
---
Finally someone gets it
---
I don‚Äôt think he is
---
You should remix it so tick just spout out gibberish and penny just says a very slowed-down arrgh from the SpongeBob intro sequence
---
This never happened?
---
Can we start a bruh chain?
---
Lmao what are you talking about
---
Im level five and my teamates are level two and the peolpe who im fighting are level 1 and 2 how its that fair???
---
And read brawl stars guides works better
---
What did you get?
---
Yeah i know
---
#chronopierce for dev
---
i think rosa (on release) would have been broken here. Just use the super halfway through the map
---
What was the reason they gave you? Screenshot the home screen and link to the photo. 
---
Also, you will need to give your game ID too.
---
Turtle master enchantment but in Brawl Stars

Who did u get?

Power levels have nth to due with match making

Right again XD sry

30 gems for a big box, isn't that awful value?

When they are still watching how youl oose, and you caught them

Sadly,grinding is wothless now.

They're all listed in the News section in game as well

The only data Clash Royale has to transmit is when and where each player plays their cards. Everything else is automated. Brawl Stars has to constantly transmit all of the brawler positions, any shots happening, whether they have supers, etc...it takes a lot more processing / network than CR does, so it doesn't matter if CR is working
---
What!!!!!
---
Matchmaking is based on trophies, not power level.

I can make a version 2 of it with the loading icon, and when it loads there can be a skip icon

THAT'S HOT, THAT'S HOT

Just low trophies
---
Yes in 30 secs. It get roll to you.

But you can easily run away, which makes it at least kind of fair. Key word kind of.

Looks like you draw it and use magic  to make it true 3D
---
WHOLESOME

Legendary is hard enough to get

This should be obtained by pure skills maybe when u finish the trophy road

I'll prove you wrong, just look at my latest post

Maybe if I replace middle fences with grass it would look better,thanks for adviceüòÄ

Hey mate, just between you and me, are you his best friend or something? You just make comments on every single one of his threads and is always agreeing with him,  what the hell?

I agree. It‚Äôs my first ever animation and I just made it for fun, not really to get added in game. Thanks for the feedback üòÉ

Did you lose 3 trophy‚Äôs in the game before and pressed replay without going to the home screen?!
---

You must be around 300 trophies on primo , that's y , at that range any brawler is good lol.

And they copied Fortnite a support a creator üòÇ

r/CursedComments

They were monkeying around since the start, but if you want to see the own goal to make sure they didn't lose, it's right before the match end at 0:06 or so

Ship

Doesn't look that much simpler
---
Yes this is the accurate representation of it.
---
I completely agree. I more made it just for fun, not really to get added in game

This isnt a bug or tecnical issue so it doesnt care for supercell

White on pic represents death due to thrist for power cubes

Hwy, Primo, let's go brawl-balling!

That‚Äôs depressing

I feel the pain.

Name checks out
---
Yes because Jessie is definitely 5 years old.
---
It was time for Thomas to go.  He had said to much
---
It‚Äôs still original tho, cause no one has ever made a gta themed brawl stars post....
---
Your the noob
---
No lol. Maybe as the matchup loading screen?
---
Btw the rate of exchange here is 1 star point = 2,65 scraps (or however they're called)
---
I don't really consider this copying because it's amazingly generous from a game company to thank their content creators for supporting the game.
---
why‚Äôs everyone so toxic in comments, i swear the people on this sub. if you don‚Äôt want to protect yourself from this, then at least do it for the players who you‚Äôd be queueing up with above 600 and throwing the game for.
---
Nope
---
**No.**
---
That‚Äôs the point of it. I just made it for fun
---
It not add some weeks later

Imagine not having both of Shelly's star powers

All of the above

Amazing idea! But supercell probably won't add this since they have no problem with teaming

android is better than apple

Crow is good idk what ur talking about. Just play him well

Bulls super also strong

It doesn‚Äôt work that way...
---
Yes, Android sucks, so you probably will blow up before you shoot me.
---
So adorable haha
---
r/cursedbrawlstars
---
Like heroes in clash of clans! Nice idea
---
No matchmaking is based off the highest trophies brawler to make sure people don‚Äôt boost with smurf or alternate accounts. So the enemy team were probably playing all together. There is no other solution to this as it is a f2p game.

Gene is the perfect GK because THE HAND‚úã

Frank &amp; Bull are massive Tanks at Center Back

Both Fullbacks Nita &amp; Carl provide assistance on defense and offense
---
Darryl rolls onto the opponents at Central Midfield
---
Brock passes the ball for attack
---
Rico is the playmaker of the team
---
Leon and Crow are the lightning-fast wingers ‚ö°
---
and Mortis dashes through the defenders and is a proven goalscorer‚öΩ
---
I like your spelling
---
youtube have a lot of dyi these days
---
Mayybbeeee on another wayyy...
---
This sub sometimes makes me feel weird.. I could never relate to something like this due to age.
---
I think the megabox is 2000
---
If thats the case, then you should receive a way more regular tokens. Like if I was to push to 10000 I want atleast 2500 tokens or more
---
Nope. 84.
---
Yeah isn‚Äôt that because the season resets?
---
(   .   )  \___/   (  .  )

olo ho olo
---
There old games made it really easily to get brawlers. Now they spit on your face to buy gems to get 2 day offer free brawlers
---
I see nothing wrong
---
Yup
---
That makes no sense because it could just act like a new Brawler
---
You got a pretty good point there. The boss ,and robo bandits, are a little dated.
---
Same XD
---
GiMmE a BeAt
---
It never ends!!!ü§£
---
So 1k trophies for this ?
---
Well, just swap "during class" to "at work" and "teacher" to "boss".
---
Reddit is strange isn't it?
---
But with the new trophy system that does not happen anymore :3
---
What app you user?
---
Go just search brawl stars restaurant
---
OP, read his username before you get offended over something you're proud of.

Ok sorry if I'm rude

Yes because he‚Äôs on water
---
I sometimes do be like that

"Do it!"

Very sorry that this happened to you.  
---
Unfortunately, I don't think supercell support can help you, they only do bugs and stuff if I'm not mistaken. My best advice is to build up that clan, invite the people who previously were there, ask them to invite more of the people who there there as well.
---
It‚Äôs that a thing?
---
Un Poco Doggo
---
good bot
---
I had to make a new clan because every time I would send the kicked people an invite link, they would get a message saying they were banned and they couldn‚Äôt join. So there is actually a bug
---
Darryl
---
!isbot
---
Cause it's pretty badly drawn.
---

No it‚Äôs cuz he kept losing. Basically how season reset works is that let‚Äôs say u get a brawler to 500 but u keep pushing that brawler. If the brawler is at 600 by the time the season resets, it gets bumped down to the number between 600 and 500 (so 550). So let‚Äôs say u get a brawler to 700, it would go down to 600 (cuz that‚Äôs the amount in between 700 and 500). I think supercell does this so that u don‚Äôt have like 50000 trophy account with a 7000 trophy Leon.
---
Good comparison
---
Yeah me too
---
I tried my best tho
---
Robo Retreat
---
Jesus dude all he did was repost a meme, that's not grounds to tell him to kill himself
---
I got crow and bibi out of the same big box the day she was released. Luck is so weird.
---
Yeah this is the original.
---
they say supercell is going to discontinue  in Viet Nam. i dont know when
---
He literally could've just walked in
---
I don‚Äôt have Morris. Is it just because he can attack out of the way real fast?
---
Food! I forgot about brawl stars in total since I quit the game several months ago and I don't think about coming back. However, #mortisgang.
---
Whats with Barley's face. . . or eye. . .
---
You're gonna love this only the 50% above 500 is converted to star points so if you have 516 at the end of the season you'll have 508 trophies afterwards and eight star points
---
U.... S T O O P I D
---
I got Crow, Spike, Tara, Gene, and Frank all from regular boxes. 
---
Pam, and Piper from big boxes
---
Mortis from my first mega
---
Is this from Wimpy Kid series?
---
I'm 7k before the trophy buff with only 1 lvl 8 character
---

But... we were getting along... and I don‚Äôt Team :(
---
Max piper OP at this time
---
GUM
---
Yes so thats a lesson he should havelearnt
---
"Walk it in if u can"
---
My face when mortis zips round the corner and im a squishy lil dyna
---
I buy apple to flex. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs better. So I can flex.
---
Not just that he can Dodge shots, if he goes straight to kill the throwers it's really hard for them to aim at him
---
STOP BREAKING THE CHAIN!!!
---
Yeah,its also why hes a counter to frank.he beats any laggy brawlers
---
I guess chickens raised away from the healthy farm chickens are not good food at all. Hello friend.
---
I don‚Äôt m is the meaning of that thing you said but nice to meet ya Friend! *holds hand out for a hand shake*
---
"Time to rest"
---
Agreed :)
---
It almost looks as if crow could fly in through one of spike's eyes and come out thru his mouth lol
---
Yes, *E*ffort does, in fact, start with the most common letter of the English alphabet, E.

Buy gold for all of us, start communism

I did not knew what tag to put it on.

The invincibility for teammates that respawn should go away when they attack for reasons like this.

Username checks out.

Sorry Man...

Good idea,my man darrel wouldn't mind a buff.

Ricardo Colt
---
Its looks like bugs penny
---
Nope mostly randoms, thanks for assuming though
---
Oh I didn't notice that it was referring to the Brawlers icon
---
Ikr, another p2w noob :/
---
Oh god rosa will be op
---
But they will have a hard time sharing those points because there's two of them, so maybe not
---
More like Ricolto Bullos xDDD
---
President of 550k clan here, I give a Senior+ role to only the most close people I know IRL, everyone else is a member, and if someone asks for a senior, fuck them.
---
Bruh Chain:
---
I have an idea, how about every kill u get in solo showdown, u get one star point. If it‚Äôs in duos it would get exploited maybe, it‚Äôs a lot of repawns and more deaths in duos so it is a little weird to implement it and can help make people play solo without teaming
---
Are you cheese clay on youtube? I really loved the bibi work and Bunny penny. Niiice
---
Vc √© Brasil?
---
I heard it as Rosa is my name, f\*\*king is my game lmao
---
Why Brock‚Äôs ear as the pic
---
Nita seems pissed because mecha crow saved her bear/dog
---
Yeah it‚Äôs a shelly with her super and bandaid
---
He didn‚Äôt rank up his brawlers evenly
---
Removed. Rule 3. No providing information on how to break Supercell Terms of Service.

Whenever I make a new friend, I bite them in the shoulder as a test of trust.

That reminds of me of this other meme i saw

Let's not. Its become stale at this point.

So people just google ‚Äòbrawler name‚Äô restaurant and find it?

(showdown) don't be impatient, if the current map isn't good for the brawler that you're trying to push, don't play
---
(Any 3vs3 mode) don't play with randoms if you don't have so much ability with the brawler you're playing with
---
Now we're talking
---
Also cause he 3 shots them
---
Yeahhh. I was playing earlier and in the very last siege, as my team was about to win, my wife called me. When I got off the phone and checked, we obviously won, but I got no rewards for it. That's super obnoxious.
---
i‚Äôm only at 8.3k trophies but i don‚Äôt need too much more power points and with the new trophies system it‚Äôs 2x as fast to max a brawler
---
I lost after
---
Yep there‚Äôs rosa, as I expected like 2 months ago ü§©
---
or does it?
---
Tara, the shadow who appears of his portal
---
That looks a bit creepy
---
Thats a good point, and that is not fair at all
---
KEEP IT GOING!!!!

Oof

Sorry don‚Äôt feel like getting 3 more Shelly trophies
---
*I DONT CARE!!!!! KEEEEP ITT GOOING
---
Once I literally had a dream about Darryl having a voice lol but I forgot what he said
---
Save
---
We need this, instead of Showdown, because teaming so bad right now
---
The efforts they made to keep those rage-quity randoms to keep playing but they still quits, so the only thing this system does is punishing those who lags
---
Do not use the work of others for your fucking benefit.
---
and i have 10k and still dont have a legendary and mortis
---
It‚Äôs not magical it‚Äôs bull heaven
---
3-2 some brawlers can do the same tho, like piper, bi bi and bull
---
#Mortis with second star power
---
All good
---
You got my upvote, mad respect for taking your time to write this masterpiece, most underrated comment, deserves much more love
---
100 siege wins with no losses would only be 800 trophies

This is traced from my art.

Where does it say they are called mousebots?
---
I agree about this but gem grab is also a fun game mode i saw epic comebacks in gem grab with 3 seconds remaining for the match many times
---
and i have 10k and missing leon spike crow and mortis
---
It has nothing
---
#run
---
Beautiful and unpractical
---
8.5/10
---
Trust me, you are gonna regret it if you open
---
1. Tara is a female
---
2.Her star power may seem useless but if the enemies survive you ult plus some attacks their quick fire attacks will target her shadow witch can save you and your team. Her shadow is very distracting and can be used to track down enemies.
---
3.If you don't like this star power, she will receive a second one. Her second SP will have her shadow heal you 400 up per attack with the same attack speed but from range
---
One time i saw one restaurant called sakura

So ur chance goes higher

Yes, but actually no. If you die. You give your bounty to the killer. If you had a large bounty, and die, the enemy Will have points, at the end of the game, the most wealthy in total stars wins It all, so dying with big bouties means Hippity hoppity your trophys are now their property.
---
They should give more star points for ranks 10, 15 and 20. Also for the end of season. Another thing would be giving star points at the end of the season.

How heavy is the weight vest your wearing to stop you spinning?
---
Well that's your opinion
---
YESSSS
---
I think 400+.
---
They can ask for permission, and supercell really wanted to do crossover from games
---
This happened to me too
---
I am really trying to play w/o teaming (i know in this match it doesn't look like i am)
---
it's raining outside
---
Throwing the game away
---
üò†üò†üò† who are u say that i suck. did u play with me see that? i am gonna report u
---
But they made robo Mike spin
---
This is a playground for bull, dynamike and Bo
---
We all know whats the favorite buffet for mortis üòÇ
---
Please?!?
---
Eww I don't wanna eat that weird looking Dyna
---
In my opinion, linebacker bull is a waste of star points. 2,500 for a recolor is too much in my opinion.
