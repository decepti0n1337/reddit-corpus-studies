You did your math wrong
---
---
---
Ok DAMN BRO like I can barely handle him as he is and you had to go out of your way to make this monstrosity?
---
It's a good effort bud :)
---
am I the only one who thinks Star shelly is better than bandita
---
Its a 2018 skin, you played in 2018, you got it
---
That’s even more ridiculous. No need to give the tank killer the health of a tank
---
It's actually not mine and yes he can be annoying AF but gotta say he thicc
---
Why tf your video in portrait but ur game in landscape this hurts. Downvote
---
Wtf you are not making any sense mortis has nothing to do with this
---
Anyone just use normal Shelly? Because I do 🤷‍♂️
---
F for broken chain.
---
Uh oh. Guys. He’s fucking shaking.
---
no.
---
you turn around and look up
---
I play Piper in Friendly Practice.  (Bots, heist, kaboom canyon. 
---
Get your super and jump over to top right corner and simply just wail away (corner is max range)
---
So OP. Especially because it doesn't matter at what range you hit, you still get half an ammo.
---
You called him a power cube haha that was funny epic 😎😎😎😎virginity rocks!

okay but should i repost the map
---
Nice
---
My fellow brethren got the star player though ;)
---
but in the videos it said he was a robot :|
---

---
also they said colt had shotgun or something but ur correct
---
Everyone in this comment section being amazed, me: “uhhh, yeah”
---
They don’t care their ultimate goal is to make money
---
Up to you. If you think my suggestion shouldn't be added. Let it like that.
---
It’s Reddit. 
---
We don’t do that here.
---
Lol

I kill lots of shellys as Morris.... And as penny but hey were not talkomg about me here....
---
The best brawler.
---
okay thanks
---
Well I have only Shell Shock.... so yeah I'm automatically cool
---
Really?
---
When ur dyna is lvl 6...
---
Why not
---
If you can’t land two hits on a Colt without getting killed, then you’re probably just bad at using Mortis.
---
Lol I was actually thinking about saying that. Also r/forgottoswitchaccounts ?
---
I don't see why unlocking everything would stop me from playing brawl stars altogether.  
---
 Unlocking every star power just means that I would have a Huge variety in options, and I'd be able to experiment all the more.  
---
And besides that, BS is being updated frequently with new brawlers and maps. So anything i earn beyond maxing out my account Currently does Not go to waste, but is being stockpiled for use later on.
---
Nah he’s just tooting his own horn
---
The Mortis gang is going after me, help me!
---
Very good

Yeah I didn’t. I grinned ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

Shelly is top tier and even before band aid she was op.

I think the point was that it should be shown as a token that you were playing before global.
---
We don't do that here
---
No offense to mikes who don’t team tho
---
Whoops
---
U probably got this picture from someone else that was playing, so u could be the red team in this picture. So red team won.

Same but only for his crow that he didnt deserve im not jealous bcuz he hav em and me not
---
It’s not about the money. It’s about making a statement.
---
Maybe the bot took over because of lag and you had to watch because the lag wouldn’t let you play?
---
Will do! I suck at BB though so that will take lots of time and patient teammates lol

I gave my argument little one, and judging from your response, it seems I hit a nerve. I gave my views upon how it is unfair to compare Brawl Stars to racing games, and up you go about PvZ, which has no connection whatsoever to what I was talking about. Added again to the childish insult of “pee-pee” instead of contributing to the discussion.
---
Child, I know it is difficult to use basic real life etiquette in this vast world of anonymity we call the internet, but trying to act like a big guy while showing that you have the mindset of a 12 year old doesn’t help you accomplish anything, be it in here or the real world. Using “pee-pee” in particular doesn’t help, and talking about PvZ when even the OP is talking about racing games, doesn’t help either.
---
It is difficult to improve as a person, and easy enough to insult somebody under a false username in the internet, but no matter how difficult it is to improve as a person and researching about games you don’t know about, I believe you can do it child.

No-one else to play with. Closest thing to a fellow player is Mortis, but he keeps impaling the ball. Plus he's too fast.

Great edits!
---
They are both queued up with the bibi.
---
You have bo and crow? That’s over 100,000. How is that even possible?
---
Very nicely played but not many meteorites hit you. If I was teamed on like this, I have to worry about the damned rock half the time along with the teamers
---
Ugh, this hurts me.
---
Then that match is impossible to be queued into, frank on Twitter has explained the way the matchmaking works, so either this is photoshop, or they queued as a team.
---
YES next is legendary fp lol you didnt know?
---
Than mythiccccc then superrare and.....
---
Exactly the point is to always have something to work for
---
see- I'm a Mortis main with almost 800 trophies on my Mortis but only power 7. I see a offer in the shop that would give me enough power points to upgrade him to power 8, but I'm broke.

Thats where the gems come in

So CUTEE
---
Because of all objective evidence available. Your stupid example rarely happens in actual games. Most people with a brain can neutralize a Shelly (without bandaid) before she ever gets close.
---
Give up what? The upperhand? Bull had very little chances, especially since meteors targeted him, and not you.
---
Not after band-aid.
---
I’ve been playing it longer than 4 months :(

Lmfao, thanks? Really didn't expect you here

Before the trophy change I only had barley maxed, I knew pushing him to 500 would be easy so I focused on others instead, now I have everyone 500+ and they’re lvl 5-7

Unless....?

---
Enemy im trying to run from you
---
Homerun!
---
Was too lazy xD
---
Okay   I have a idea that it fires a firework that explodes when hit someone it has a medium range and explode gives burst damage and for super it throw a bomb that heal all teammeates at bomb's range but I can't find a name
---
because randoms suck
---
Im just sharing and every post here its like me i post what i want
---
How did you get them to answer ? I let them 1000 messages for 2 separate issues. All I got is a basic automatic bot that always say the same thing. And it gives me no possibility to talk to a human.
---
shellys are stupid, they think they can win anyone with a super... so dumb
---
Haha I hope surpercell adds something like this
---
might be
---
Is just me or Poco does not say "Give me a beat" anymore?
---
Still OP? Yeah, kinda. At least there’s not 2 in every single 3v3 though, I don’t face against Tick that often nowadays
---
That's why the robots are my best friends
---
I remember when i exposed a repost and the guy who reposted it asked if i have a link from the real post which was like a month old and I got around -10 downvotes
---
it was worse, before Rosa got nerfed. You could just use her ulti and finish off the game.
---
Medium hp. Attack: extends his arm kinda like carl's attack and if hits then also hits enemy targets nearby. Super: throws healing/damage potion on the ground like Pam's turret with new starpower. Slow movement speed. 1st starpower: when hits enemy with attack then the extended hit has 2X range. 2nd starpower: allies and you when hit by your super gain movement speed
---
Mortis should work at the funeral and I see Leon more as an secret agent.
---
Yeah I think that you are that low trophy guy that thinks gene is bad, while he is one of the strongest brawlers right now xD
---
I can confirm you are a normie by just look to other comments

Can't relate 😂
---
Shelly&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;luck
---
Mortis is good. But sometimes you let the excitement take over and you start spamming auto-aim, resulting in the above
---
I have 6K and i have everyone except leon.
---
The problem is when you aim the first one and hit but the other two are auto aim because you need to auto aim thoes to win the battle. At least in my experience
---
Ok, so what's about update? New legendary brawler and new game modes? Or new luck system and clan wars?
---
To farm power cubes to beat a record
---
Auto aim shots the nearest enemy to you. Just press the shooting button with aiming and that’s auto aiming.
---
Chill out guys I just stole his hat
---
I got crow at 2.5k and honestly i hated myself for it, seeing that ny brother plays the game all day and is at 8.5k and his rarest brawler is frank while i have crow and tara at 2.5k just made me sad for him. They should give something like "luck boosters" for high trophy rewards like double your legendary chance at 8k if you dont have one yet. Just my opinion tho
---
Yeah, this post right here officer.
---
Actually, Shelly is very OP... 
---
Some tips: At the beginning, you can go for boxes but not for a fight. You should try to get your super by chipdamaging enemys. If you got your super go into a bush and if an enemy comes, you can easily kill him. No matter how many power cubes he got. Not everyone knows that the super button can shoot "normal" shots, if the super isn't ready. So, if an enemy with 15 power cubes comes to you, spam that super button as fast as you can. Yeah...
---
I’ve never used auto with mortis since the beta and i usually win battles BCUZ i dont use auto. If you can use your fingers fast enough you dont need to spam auto
---
This is beyond science
---
Frank said it was a 0.001 percent chance of happening
---
Maybe tramp and snap
---
I use the two
---
But you can do this in any live game with Shelly lol. When is the last time you saw crow chain super like that? Or bibi?
---
Ye, i know the basics. But its always delayed or too late. Like, a primo is close to me. I super, but somehow he got away and I only deal like 500 dmg. Can never get too close with her, i get countered by franks bibis shellies colts nitas etc and when I get super its just too late.
---
Imagine me being in a bush with 10 star points. I walk into a shelly with super with 2 points and yet i still lose cuz she somehows auto aims faster and can keep it going to stun me. If i tried that, i would fail and shed auto first or id succeed but fail to keep it going.
---
"S O W D O W"
---
Panic super actually works
---
Oh... Then good luck .-.
---
That means it doesnt exist :(
---
Well it jist the same power before Gene been balanced  :v
---
Yap r/cyrsedbrawlstars exists
---
A creeper
---
Lol, i am not from Iran but i agree with him
---
No walls... interesting...
---
but I'm at 14k
---
I'd make it 2000 health, to be better then Poco's
---
It needs to be stronger for me but ok
---
I got my Crow at 1,2k and Spike (in my second account) at 1,3k
---
I don't even have a power lvl 9 brawler and im at 12.2k you should be happy that you have atleast 3 sp's
---
Ok, and still, frank is considered one of the not great brawlers. Why do you think that is?
---
Me on 14k: no legendaries
---
A frank long stun would be better tbh
---
he is best in brawl ball
---
Your post has been removed, make sure to use the body of a post to elaborate on the title.
---
U deleted a comment saying i am dumb, thank u for not thinking, first of all lets say u have 27 brawlers all above 500 which means u have 13500 trophies, last season u pushed 2600 additional trophies and got 1300 star points out of it which means u only have 16100 trophies and not 18k, r/quityourbullshit
---
Great job! You want a lollipop?
---
Cute.
---
Yes! I finally upgraded my mortis,only 10 brawler left to upgrades!
---
Holy fricking frick what the frick
---
[removed]
---
No, brawl ball is his best mode, doesn't mean there isnt a plethora of better choices
---
It do be like that
---
2600 star points
---
U literally cant prove it
---
12.2k is terrible hahaha
---
Not even 1k brawlers get +2
---
#BrothersForLife
---
thanks for reply and good luck man
---
I know someone who got spike before 1k trophies, I’m rlly lucky tho so I never complain about how many brawlers I have, I’m missing leon and crow
---
Im shaking... its too hot for me... halpp
---
The vid says otherwise in ur profile, also it is 1201 and not 1300 so it means u pushed 2400 additional trophies which means u got 15900 trophies
---
Wonder how they're gonna respond to this
---
Ok then tell me your in game username
---
No but i got Another star power at Colt today
---
I have no idea, but I’m looking forward to it
---
Open my profile and u will see my gamer tag
---
Get the f*ck out of my room! I'm playing Brawl Stars!
---
or grab and squish
---
Very nice video
---
i never said he is op, i think that his super could get little tweak, like less radius but more damage, also,  ,,not considered good brawler" doesnt mean anything, people think brawler is bad, when he realy isn't, just like people tought poco was bad/crow is bad/jessie is bad you see where im coming ?
---
"You forget a thousand things everyday,make sure this is one of em'."
---
I can prove #GUGY00UR

No, Mortis.
---
Jokes on you Im 4k and also Im so unlucky
---
Няшно)
---
Bruh I've only played since global and alot of other people have star powers and legendaries that are lower trophies than me
---
They removed it  cause Gene was overpowered but i want it back
---
Lol you could get a night mecha crow
---
Probably 2nd place in duo showdown, and the fifth.
---
Tara’s super is good, but its SLOW. Leon’s is too kinda. I’m not saying to directly nerf her super, but to make it charge slower.
---
I have a photo of me last December 19 brawlers 10k
---
happens every single day lol
---
That is not true, it is a chance. So there is no confirmed legendary with any amount of boxes
---
Same, look at my profile aswell, lets close the subject now cus it is getting toxic, i may have misjudged u
---
No no no its sexy time poco xᴅ
---
Why though
---
How would you buff Rolling Reload? (Although I personally think its decent)
---
Why 🤔😂
---
El primo is the best brawler say Y e s
---
There has been a recent glitch where you can snap star powers (you can use a star power on another brawler)
---
This guy: killed Mortis at really low health that possibly the colt took down. 
---
Also this guy: Missed two shots trying to shoot colt. 
---
Also this guy: Saying God is playing.
---
Missed opportunity to name it “Smash and Grab”
---
How do you react when kairos disagrees with you on the strength of brawlers?
---
Well, at first I didn’t realize it was an announcement for r/brawlstars and not the game. So I really have no idea. My guess is something to celebrate 200k subs
---
😝
---
Yeah I agree that would be really overpowered, her turret already offers so much control, it would make her have the ability to dominate the entire map
---
Do you think bo's new starpower is gona be op?
---
Hi 
---
Which legendary brawler is your favourite?
---
His attack is so fast that if you want to use his star power you have to time it right. Which is why I said 75%
---
1 What is your opinion on organized teaming? Why people who do organized teaming aren't getting banned?
---
2 How do you come up with a new cringy intro every meme rewiew?
---
the answer is so obvious that i dont even need to say it
---
So she played with her phone upright?
---
Me!
---
How are ya (Honestly tho, i love ur vids)
---
r/emojipolice
---
Super
---
How old are you
---
What's your real name
---
What brawler do you think is the most balanced?
---
How about aftet he uses his super he gets faster reload speed for 5 seconds
---
Owh
---
Overall I think it’s pretty good considering the dev team was on vacation for a month. Definitely some small balancing fixes and improvements to the Star Shop are needed, but I think they’ll fix that next update.
---
Tbh it looks like there is a lot more than 27 brawlers
---
(Brawl Stars) How the luck system works?
---
When you were opening mega boxes to get the new star powers, you opened 10 mega boxes without getting a star power, how is this possible, 10 mega boxes mean 100 boxes and there is 1% chance to get a star power.
---
this is literally just leon but deep fried
---
You’re lucky you got penny I have crow and spike and I still don’t have penny
---
What inspired you to do YouTube and play brawl stars?
---
Life Leech
---
Shud i continue to deliver gems to enemys??!
---
That has more buzz words than a Morgz YouTube video
---
*earrape losing theme starts playing*
---
That's not what i want
---
5k, Mortis and all legs still to come, my big box says legendary chance is 0.048% chance
---
you stole this
---
How soon do you expect the update where star points can be used to buy brawl boxes? (P.s. love your videos)
---
Balance changes: Im about to end this girl whole career
---
Are you planing to push a brawler to 1000 trophies and do you think there should be more ranks, maybe to 25-30
---
You’re back! It’s been a while since you’ve been here
---
i got el primo at 4.5k
---
What is the one small feature Supercell needs to add to Brawl?
---
Is there anything that you’re currently unsatisfied with in this game? If yes, what would you do to improve it?
---
(And keep your beard too I kinda like it)
---
Tara and Leon need slow supers because theirs are arguably better. Shelly is garbage without her super, is garbage if she’s battling vs long range brawlers even w/ her super, and is garbage in most 3v3s, even with her super AND bandaid.
---
How many upvotes do I have to have too be on meme review?
---
The reason they did the star power thing was because they have a required 1 month vacation in Finland, so something like that will happen once a year. (Btw it was 2, not 3 months of star powers)
---
It's a glitch, once I went up against an all piper team
---
In your opinion.what is your idea to give player get more exciting log in to the games?
---
Like my idea daily rewards.

Thanks

Great question! I’m not sure it’s very exciting haha. I tend to work most days. I live with my girlfriend. Hang out with family and friends when I can. I play other games besides Brawl Stars sometimes. Try to gym it 3 times a week. I like to cook. Netflix/TV. That’s basically it haha
---
🤔
---
Band Aid, Screeching Solo, and Bibi
---
c'mon this is good wish It got more recognition
---
1.What event modifiers would u add or delete from the game?
---
2.And do u think supercell should add modifiers to some of the 3v3s ?
---
3.why did u start making a lot of meme reviews ? You used to do one each month now its trippled to be 3 times a month , tbh i missed ur brawler/super ect ranking videos
---
4.who's your favourite youtuber ?
---
5. Are u enjoying ur life as a youtuber ?
---
6.whats the major problem in the game at your opinion( exclusing teaming )
---
I am a fan since beta and i loved your content a lot! Sadly i dont enjoy it like before but its likeable, anyways dont take my  opinion like u should change or anything , be yourself this is just my honest opinion of ur content
---
The only reason your including it is because YOU are a global release player.
---
r/bettereveryloop
---
well it's easy if you had 8k after trophy changes but if you had 5k or 6k trophies it's not that easy
---
Stop beging. They will make skin for leon and other brawlers just give them time. Please..
---
What new brawler mechanics would you like to see that currently aren’t in the game?
---
satisfy
---
his super is half of map wide, also, if you think that brawlers should be balanced based on win rate etc., then they should nerf nita...
---
I made one for the trophy pushing contest actually (when Ninja &amp; others streamed)! But I never play it, probably never will
---
I got have 8k but when I was 7k I got 1k trophies I n 2hours
---
Could there ever be like a duel game mode where it's like 1v1 or 5v5 bcuz Ive always wanted 1v1s to prove who's better at the game n stuff like that
---
I’m sickened, but curious
---
How much money did you spend in brawl stars?
---
and brawler with the worst possible star power. ever.
---
While you’re there I’m here trying to ask support real things and get the stupid automated responses 😪
---
I see you watch undertale anime At haha ok..
---
It’s certainly possible haha, i doubt it though. If they do they better increase the drop rate haha 🤨
---
Oh god thats awesome. Im on my way to my 7k mega and i pray im gonna get at least something as good as you
---
I really want something new in the game because now that I have all my brawlers at 500 I see no point playing the game . I also have to unlock spike and crow to unlock but I don’t think that ever gonna happen . O really want end game content how about you??
---
Lucky bitch.
---
If combined all our power lvl, then my team got 21 power lvl and enemy team, got only 15. I mean, 2 lvl 8-s and some skilled player vs people who just started playing game (like their Bull)
---
Are you going to do more about the brawl gangs, I really like those videos and I hope you can do more :)
---
I played coc for about 3 years pretty intensely. Was in Reddit Dark and then Reddit Troopers
---
You have seen this post 100 times in the sub t
---
Right?
---
But sometimes it's unconvenient cuz if u wanna steal the gems from a 600hp brawler u just kill him and u can't get his gems
---
Can do this video?
---
Use worse comp in every mode and win
---
You can get stuck behind a corner without using auto aim
---
What is or was your favorite meta in the game’s history? It can be from the beta as well.
---
Which brawler and star power is rocking this meta???? Btw love your videos
---
Nope, His Normal Attack damage is OK, but his super damage is too OP, please nerf his super damage to tie him with Colt, that's all he needs.
---
That will probably be life leech
---
How can i make a creator code for brawl stars to put on my videos?
---
It's only my opinion, cuz i don't have Coiled Snake, Mortis really feels underpowered and even somehow weak in solo showdown.
---
HONESTLY.. I think there needs to be a much better reason to push high trophies/grind Brawl Stars. The Star Shop/Trophy Road isn't it.
---
Gg!
---
REEEEEPOOOOOSSSSTTTT
---
Roll
---
0.1728% in a mega box.
---
If u were stuck with one brawler on an island who would it be and why?
---
Oh ok
---
That’s so true I’m from Iran tho supercell plsssssss fix it
---
Very nice
---
They need to make it easier to unlock all brawlers of all rarities!
---
What do you think about it??
---
Also they need to make trophy road better 
---
Why should I push to 11k for 300 gold...
---
Maybe they're laughing ther asses off but won't respond
---
Umm im still new at this reddit thing + im still 4 days on here so i wont know
---
Absolutely lucky :( 
---
PS: I'm at 10,5k and haven't got a mythic or legendary Brawler.
---
Hey that’s me I’m only missing all the legendaries at 10.6k and my chance is 0,1344
---
What is your favourite video made by you?
---
Hmmmm 🤔
---
What do you think the best and worst brawlers are right now, and what's your favorite brawler?
---
Me with the chicks :P
---
The name of the font
---
Great idea. You're my favourite.
---
Looks like you can’t spell Showdown either.
---
What if i got the joke and just trying to get woooshed?
---
😂
---
That star power was at The game b4 but it make 300 damage
---
How is nobody else shaking?
---
I KNIW IT FUK BOY
---
Spike doesn't know either
---
Then just chill with the posting. 10 posts in 4 days? I mean just chill and see which memes are overused. You’ll learn in 2 seconds
---
When its confirmend?
---
Thanks, lets see
---
I thought you were answering to a comment of someone I blocked because when you block someone you can't see their comments but I'll guews you can see the comments made by the people answering them
---
He must say spagheti
---
Do you think if Supercell will put in quests for Brawl Stars
---
Those kids are in-game friends and are teaming in showdown,without killing each other and killing us,ruining the SOLO...
---
Its coc
---
Gene is my fave brawler! This SP would be amazing!
---
Spike and piper are his fav, idk his worst
---
Is this some kind of bad luck flex? xD
---
So my PB is about 12100 trophies and  my rarest brawler is Tara, my only mythic girl
---

Hey! Big fan and love your videos! I have four questions. 1) Who do you think needs the biggest buff? 2) Who do you think needs the biggest nerf? 3) Which star power needs the biggest buff? 4) Which star power needs the biggest nerf?

Thanks!

How about dealing the damage at the end of the pull?

Thanks!!

I’m 3k with spike and Leon

~1,000 dollars to max a brand new account. In coc it would cost like 100K +

Why does Leon have eyes
---
wow yeah that's unusual
---
Those were from the Pam we ganged up on. We weren’t teamed....just smartly both went after the most dangerous opponent
---
You forgot stolen concepts.
---
Nahhh...2nd star power should be "to be able to pull a teammate"
---
but that doesn't make it ok to take his work and post it again
---
Tara
---
luck cant be "fair" and I doubt they will change that, Im surprised you're not quitting because of teaming, bad maps, matchmaking, bad brawler balance, bad star power balance, p2w advantages, having to push a brawler to 800+ every season to push against more dedicated players, bad trophy road rewards, no reward at the end of seasons...
---
It’s funny- everyone knows Morris Is the thiccist
---
Shrekochet

I’m on 4K and have no legendary and one mythique

Do Spick next plz

Blets are just dumb 9 yo maggots teamers

My friend got leon at 2k.
---
? His super already goes through walls... what are u talking about?
---
Very very very very bad edit, seriously why do people like this
---
those dont appear as often but maybe I'll make a part 2 lmao
---
Hmm, but you have spike icon
---
I am 9.9k and have all brawlers ecsept frank  pam spike
---
I use too of them, but i still like star more, she looks so thicc in star skin

To. be. continued.

---
Thanks bro.

Dude
---
It ***IS*** true I see more teaming mecha bo's
---
Probably also factored in that the percentages were pretty close together and that you lost by time and not because your team's safe was cracked.
---
i got crow at 4k and leon at 5 k
---
Happens too often :(
---
Dragon's daddy

Do you think there will be more thing for star points like boxes, more skins or even resources like gold?

When Gene first came out his super didn't go through walls, but it did damage when it pulled someone. They changed it like two weeks later
---
His?
---
This be bad
---
Woof much coin
---
Im fucking shaking
---
1) How are you doing?
---
2) What brawler do you think has the most similar in strength starpowers and which one do you think has the least similar in strength starpowers?.
---
Is this AMA 9/10??🤔
---
Good bot
---
Second sp is like screeching solo
---
Why was this comment downvoted?
---
Poco is famous!
---
sorry, I kinda foregot.....
---
Spike's stance at the end works perfectly there haha
---
That's stupid. You'd delete the whole game cuz an OP aspect of one character got balanced?
---
My fave is Shelly..... I don't need a legendary (for now)
---
I made an idea about this, you can see it in my profile, but people said I was salty. And their small brains cant get that: "People that played more, deserves more legendaries". Fuck all of them which said salty to me. Fuck their fucking mother and fucking father and their fucking life, fucking sisters and brothers and their fucking career fuck their entire life

---
Hey David, Nat, and Rey it’s Tsoudapop/UnkemptMango! How are you all doing?
---
Did you forgot how to switch reddit accounts?
---
Love the artwork, but the concept needs... improvement.
---
Sharpshooters need to be able to defend themselves at all times, like Rico, otherwise they would be VERY likely to die. For a special homing attack it obviously takes a long time to reload and between this time Rocky has too little health. To balance it he had to be as thick as Carl. Also his normal range should be buffed because loads of brawlers can outrun his attack by running around obstacles.
---
Also, his super isn’t too original. Pocos screechinng solo can do both heal and damage since it’s magic, but for a bomb...not so much
---
Also it is nice that you decided to make it look like the other robots but it turns out to look too much like Rico 
---
But the artwork is real good tho

---
Uhhh, if an enemy is not in the range of your attack your auto-aim just goes to a random place, it is not a bug but... fine.
---
They said this not me it has been a long time. Before they do this auto attacks were targeting the closest enemies even if they aren’t in range (inclouding people hiding in a bush) and this caused so many problems so they changed it but i hope they change it again and make it targeting the closest enemy again.
---
no they shouldn’t. It took me a full year to get one. legendary odds should increase, but it would be nice if the actual old players got something as compensation.
---
So....... Buty 🥺

What a waste of star points, those are hard to get

I had a bunch of friends I met because I watched anime! We didn't live near each other but we loved to play games together, so one of our friends looked up multiplayer games and told us to download Brawl Stars! We all played once and they gave up on the game but I kept playing :D

Low effort.unoriginal.uncreative.

everything this meme ins't! Holy crap this is indescribable good!

Any tips for youtubers
---
HEY. TAILS OP!

I created it because I felt like crap when I got kicked from teams that told me that I sucked and my mother was a \_\_\_\_\_. NOBODY deserves to feel like crap when they're just trying to have fun playing a game. I was super nice too, and you know what? Come to think of it, I don't suck. I'm frigging awesome.
---
Ok,so what brawler is most prettiest one?And who is not?
---
That is false. When Leon was released he was op for a reason that reason is $$$. Shovels in coc cost 500 gems. CR is basically p2w. Those are some examples.
---
This on my country means d*ck 😂

---
Hey all, so this took me a few hours to make, not that good at graphics, but I thought I'd explain my thoughts on this and what each icon correlates to:
---
\- I think the scoreboard should be a toggle. Meaning, if you press on the clipboard on either team, it will hide/show the stats.
---
\- The "Pistol" icon represents kills.
---
\- The "Dead Skull" icon represents deaths.
---

There are a lot of things I want to change, such as the crappy look of it all, but due to time and lack of skill I leave as is. Yall talented artists can have it, I don't care about credit, just don't use this as clickbait on Instagram and YouTube.

Hands off, Rey's mine!

&lt;3 Tini BS - i bet his dream job is to be dreaaaamy.

I love cookies and cream :D

For Rey:Yo Rey and I'm currently trying to get 1000 colt power 1 I'm boxings friend too and my colt is currently at 650 trophies I just started after season reset love u man keep up the good work♥️
---
Hahaha
---
I think its a little bit easier than it was when you used to play! More time based rather than skill based. It could be a good thing or a bad thing depending on the way you look at it. I do think its in a good place for the player base as a whole tho!

Great question man! :D

Yes that's What I say

Not really related to brawl stars or youtube, but which anime(s) are you watching right now?
---
[deleted]
---
Gosh I hope not! They provide access to things to market/test, and then they also recognize the work creators put in with gifts sometime like a plush dragon toy or microphone, but supercell has been REALLY good about trying to make the other items in game as fair in distribution as possible
---
Hm...very interesting
---
I think all content creators are great!
---
No Bull is bush
---
Supercell's goal is to make games that will last for many many years 
---
Ofc they are business too but money isn't their #1 priority
---
I know you're awesome.... At least that's what I know from twitter
---
Ouch, I though my one friend who is a bit over 12k without any legendarys was pretty bad luck.
---
Do you guys think that the dev team will fix the matchmaking in hte next update?? Wish u the best!✌🎩

Nat is pro player and carries everyone. 100% would recommend checking out her stream.

Good to know! Thanks for replying &lt;3

Crow is balanced now I think.
---
If you want to push a crow, make sure you approach the bird quietly. 
---
Everytime I try to get close to a crow, they run away and spray me in the eye with something TOXIC. 
---
If they're sleeping, just tip toe forward then push him off his branch. AWWWWK

I have not heard any KPOP song. Which song should I listen to 1st?

Oh. Ok.😊😊😊 Don't you think that we need Rey-  the "Mortis God "   for now David ?

What are your favorite brawlers and starpowers?
---
Why are those your favorites?
---
I would LOVVVEEEE Challenges of some sort in Brawl Stars! Just something a bit different from the ladder grinding!

Im sure IX Will! I personally want to get a team together for this! Who wouldnt take a crack at taking a trip to Korea! Sounds AWESOME to meee! :D

If you could add and take away any one thing from BS what would they be?

That's cool :D

Not the biggest fan, though 2000 heal is the biggest heal and I feel that there could be a hidden use that hasn’t made it to meta yet. Some combo with Rosa or something, that will be OP.

Its not. And *it seemed* like ur jealous because the guy said that darrylgang has the best meme, and then you said leongang has the best memes...long story short, both subreddits have really good memes, and thats a big fact.

Can you give a hug to Spike?

He feels lonely right now, you are the only one that can make him happy so can you please do it? :)

Brock don’t stop.

El Tick: Rushes enemy base with 9 gems and has low health
---
Crow should be more buff
---
Probably not, because he’s usually on DND like many creators making videos. But, we will continue to do things on Twitch to connect pros and creators like Rey to you all. We did Brawl Walk and Talk with fans on my stream a few times and it was a hit! So, you don’t have to join IX to play with Rey, there are other ways you can do so!
---
ah yeah good old times

Interesting. My day job would be professional sleeper. My evening job would be witty and compassionate moderator. I think there is beauty in all forms, so a b c d e f I X.

Ok thx I was asking because my yt channel is really small so I was that playing with Rey might helpy channel expand a little
---
Holy hell. How
---
Indeed

**Shibibi**

Rey I love ypur channel sub since early beta of brawl stars
---
bot bull is the best bot
---
I was bullied and I wanted to make a change. But to change a world you have to know its people. To know a people you must join and become them. So I started streaming.
---
I think that a suitable star power for Eugenio is: Eugenio's super opens a gap in any obstacle hit by its trajectory for X seconds, such as to allow him to use his shots over obstacles. So if he grabs someone, he can already hit him right away without waiting for the wall to break, if he doesn't grab anybody, the super will make the affected obstacles transparent for X seconds to allow him to attack further or go inside. If Eugenio does not come out of the obstacles within the X seconds the obstacles in which it is positioned will automatically break, otherwise they will remain intact. Eugenio can be easily hit if he is in the opponent's beam if he is behind or inside the obstacle (Unless the seconds in which it can keep the walls open are few, in that case one might think that the walls could act as a shield to be well balanced), but nobody besides him and his team can enter it.
---
You’re just bad. It’s on you.
---
This is not his art
---
ricochet 3 😳
---
I saw this template on me irl)
---
I hope I’m not too late! Rey, what do you plan on doing in the future? who is your favorite brawler to play BESIDES Mortis? what would you do if (and a BIG if) Brawl Stars dies/gets boring? I’m in your club and I would love for you to ask these questions!
---
Great work!
---
I swear they purposely made Tick’s health and reload garbage so they can make it normal with the star power smh
---
"organized"
---
What is it?
---
You can easily see the difference between organized teaming and regular teaming
---
Another 99/100 post. You can add this one to the other 1,000,000 already existing pictures. Thank you very cool

This is stupid piper is a good brawler.

Yeah, but it’s not against Supercell’s ToS, teamers can backstab.

Well Mr. Bat wants to play...
---
This post is just "teammates bad, enemies good". Quite repetetive
---
I don't think that's a good idea.
---
OOF
---
i cant believe this fits lol
---
If you have all the brawlers then obviously it helps to wait until a new brawler comes out.
---
Otherwise it does not matter.
---
okay buddy
---
Must be a fake Cory then
---
It’s a great drawing. 
---
Did she just do a backhand slash?
---
Yes supercell Please 😭😭😭😭
---
It really depends on you
---
Either save them if a new brawler comes,or if you need resources open some or all
---
I do that too at the moment, but it changes absolutely nothing in terms of luck for new brawlers. You can immediately open every 100 boxes you get or you can collet 100 and open them all in one rush - your chances for new characters increases by the same rate
---
but the collect-then-open method feels rewarding as hell =D
---
Okay thanks
---
And after this happens they gave me the SP that doesn't show up here
---
##*Rolling Reload*
---
Thank you!!

*cough cough* basically reverting back to the original Gene super *cough cough*

Good lord,you guys dont ever give up?

When u actually had to aim with shelly. Smh. Game was so much better

woah pretty funny that you killed someone with you super

You simply reposted gedi-kor work hiding the credits

That's how band aid works!

Random number generator

It means the shop deals are randomized

It already works, but the game that i was playing doesnt appear

Thanks, I was cold

Get 400+ trophies on a brawler
---
I literally got it today
---
yeah, but now my house is partially blown up
---
She has to be brave for this game..
---
Trippy, colorful and bright! What a piece of art :D
---
Why do people even create those character-boxes like in the upper left corner ? I mean, ingame this picture never changes regardless of your skin haha
---
Man i would become rich
---
Yeah, never go into the middle in a bit match in brawl unless you want to get bombarded with attacks from every side... Bots aim for the ball immeadiently from the start of the match.
---
320 Coins* :(
---
suffering from success
---
The gedikor you wrote doesn't seem that popular
---
Either he waited for an opportunity or got angry because you guys were trash
---
The sad part about this he gets trophies and theres nothing you can do
---
Opentoonz. Probably the best possible free animation software out there.
---
Just a dumbass camping at enemy spawn thinking they could ambush them and kill them.
---
Lol you suck at the game if you can barely afford 160 starpionts lol
---
I mean you’re a fucking spike just rushing in and getting obliterated within a second
---
Come back when somebody scores to your team
---
Thanks :)
---
No. Watch the video again, he simply ran to the enemy spawn and did his best to hide until they forgot he was there. Even when countdown began for the enemy team he did nothing.
---
Don't say:Tara or Gene is gonna see the future and seeing everybody dying after giving their bests.But the only brawler which survives will be Leon.Get it?After everyone dies Leon turns visible again and then it starts that song when you lose the match.And he sees all the brawl stars universe.(from Kairos)
---
Dynamike dyna jumps over wall and water and feels safe
---
Yeah but he did it on purpose and didn’t even try to kill them when they ran back.
---
?????
---
He was the one doing nothing the entire game and expecting his teammates to 2v3???
---
Price of what?
---
Thank you, this means a lot. I love animating and frankly, I don't think I'll ever stop. I'm already working on my next one
---
Hope you can accomplish anything you're working for too.
---
Probably because he originally tried to get them on their way back and when he saw you were trash he just gave up
---
This happened to me in siege i got a phone call then came back and it said 0 
---
And i was like (# bruh)
---
Maybe we are xD xD 🤣🤣🤣
---
Used to be that way... back in my day
---
r/ihadastroke

But you lowkey wasted their trophies by being utter shit

This would have worked so much better when the game was portrait

Animația lui Bratu:))

Ik i try make them stop but they keep doing it
---
Madea lol
---
Donghoon u r amazing
---
A super rare brawler that can one shot  a brawler you get at 4000 trophies.hes like bull except he shoots twice and his super is bulls super except he bounces of walls and basically has infinite range if on water.
---
Same trophies?
---
Thanks!!!
---
You do know you don’t have to play with randoms right?
---
Rico would have fitted better
---
I didn’t say he did anything good but neither did his teammates and they would have probably lost anyway judging how the spike played
---
Is it “per dagger +100” for crow?
---
You can’t actually see that far down the map when you are at the top of the screen like he was. Also a 2v3 is a huge disadvantage. 
---
I don’t take advice from noobs that are at 2k trophies like yourself.
---
Man looks like B.E.N from treasure planet.
---
Yes its ugly
---
Search by tag would be a great feature
---
Damn ur entitled. Stop whining like the immature 12 year old u are and get used to life. You can’t always win.
---
*Give him a diamond reward*
---
Rey i have a question for you.....do you think that Mortis is ok rn with Coiled Snake or you think that he needs a little bit more?(No nerfs pls)....Check out my profile,900 last season XD.
---
Hey Rey! Just wanted to say love your vids and positive attitude. If you could go on an all expense paid trip anywhere in the world, where would you go? 
---
Keep up the great work!
---
You saw a fair bit and you also saw a certain spike dying over and over in the corner
---
Ur name is jothan, u weren’t even in the game. I know ur in game name by post history.
---
#hey thats mine give it back to me
---
#never knew that
---
Eww put it back on pls
---
But he have bounces, right?
---
Cool. I saw him in game, he looks cool as well.
---
Penis
---
And for the people that like to play with randoms? New players that queue up with randoms 100% of the time? It’s fair to those players to only have 1 teammate?

The only thing that would escape is Bibi's bubblegum.

*I'm around 6.5k and I dont even have a mythic yet, but you get legendary at 650 trophies*

Cool shot
---
These are so true. I feel like the poco one should also be uses his super right after you die to try and heal you
---
There's nothing wrong in using a format, but the way he used it is definitely unoriginal and low-effort.
