Even better
---
---
---
To me the remodel is adorable, but the icon kinda ruins it. Maybe it'll be like the Tara icon where u can select the old one as ur profile pic. But yeah, I like the new one a bit better because her eyes r adorable and her chin looks a lot better. Then again, that's my opinion
---
Oh, well u shouldn't still steal this
---
the wining pose must be the same, so we can Remember her
---
I like it!
---
Wrong place bud
---
except the icon the icon looks like dynomike face with make up
---
We will never see them again. Goodbye Ricochet...✝️
---
Nice idea. I can't stay shaking with this joke of a remodel
---
User code?
---
Yea but 8 bit range is long and crow wouldn't even want to come can touch 8 bit.
---
Give this guy a Gold medal
---
He is a shark, sharks don't eat candy (Or do they?)
---
Imagine If El Primo gets remodeled....
---

---
&amp;#x200B;
---
He will either look like Ricardo Milos or Ignacio from the 2006 comedy film, Nacho Libre
---
Whenever I read the word "butterfly", I hear PEKKA's voice in my head.
---
What do you mean ?
---
Just use...
---
*Whispering:* V.P.N
---
Guys im sh-
---
Remodels nowadays are getting out of hand tbh
---
 #S ^harpshooter
---
LOL I THANK
---
Piper looks like cinderella now
---
S h i b e:”GET BEHIND ME”
---
Hmm how do you know the others will remain all caps?
---
Developer build duh
---
In my eyes, the problem is the eyebrows, makes it sort of look like she's wearing a wig
---
wtf why do you state the obvious?
---
🎶Be a man🎶
---
Dev build
---
Thats true. I think its balanced
---
About 10100
---
it needs better eyebrows too
---
*voxel
---
The fire pattern change would be a huge buff. Now it is impossible to hit all bullet in point blank.
---
Well yes but actually no
---
Teaming sucks
---
Way better.
---
İk but its a legit stratagy
---
I was pushing my Penny on TL and my Mortis on SC, but BB will be permanent, so i still have a option to push Mortis
---
People that played before they added the trophy road and got free brawl boxes for it  
---
EXTRA STONKS
---
Can we get an F for Side Story? My fav map
---
Nice Binny
---
Ik right it should be a second option in a 1v1 mode bc king of the hill would be 1v1
---
Eugenio btw LOL
---
I wish there was power boxes on power drinks in the training cave
---
No matter what you select it’ll say 3 hours because that’s when any of the 5 events refresh lmao... I’ve been playing on and off since day 1 of beta.
---
Damn he is much slower than I thought
---
Well boys, we did it, Pat on the Back is no more
---
&amp;she isn't thicc anymore
---
Hell yeah I'm happy! NO MORE ME VS 9 SHELLIES IN SOLO SHOWDOWN 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
---
Agreed! While I like the remodels design, it doesn’t work for Piper at all. Her voice lines don’t match her appearance at all. She’s too young looking to match the older adult voice... To be honest, I don’t even recognize the new model as Piper, it looks like an entirely new brawler
---
An attempt to try to karma farm lmao
---
*frank's super animation*
---
#F
---
That is so incredibly op to be honest(Next bandaid) I don’t think I’ll have the guts to rush an 8-bit with a star under their brawler...

I pefer the new one

And please don't play Mortis.
---
A stupid icon will not make BS be a bad game, but her new icon is ugly af
---
No, cuz she looks younger
---
And her umbrella is not as it used to be
---
700 is new rank
---
Nobody complained because it still looks good on Shelly, it looks abysmal on Piper
---
#JVGRP9VR
---
This new icon is nightmare worthy...
---
Her umbrella does not look like an umbrella it looks like a shotgun
---
Make him shoot tide pods!
---
I got my tick to 600 without buffs
---
I remember when the chat before the premiere starts was "Dont kill Brawl Stars" and something
---
Lol, the new Piper is adorable! And they should know that she still has a chest, she's just blocking it with her arm and gun
---
#FirePaul
---
Bruh last year I reached 10k with 19brawlers it is much harder than u think
---
She looks much better
---
Well, shelly counters mortis so I tought putting her here
---
The super bull collecting all the cubes and running around doing nothing is so real
---
I think it's because of his use rates nowadays and they wanted to change the meta a little. Hes definitely going to become a strong brawler this update
---
I NEVER said its good
---
Truth lol
---
lmao
---
Looks like something you could build in Minecraft with lime green concrete and other materials
---
nice
---
[removed]
---
Love it!
---
You negated the opposite implying that it was good.
---
I said it was shit and you said “naw” implying it was good but k
---
Don’t beg for upvotes
---
It sounds kinda op lol
---
Extremely true , very nice
---
Piper is illegal now.
---
Requested by u/PepsiReaper
---
At least it looks better than her remodel icon. I have no idea why they made her toothless.
---
Actually he has it, this is just the picture.
---
Supercell just can't stop making tanks
---
Imo the teeth were the only necessary part but that just because I felt black eyebrows made her cuter 🤷‍♂️
---
Proof?
---
My favorite showdown map (And one of the most balanced)
---
big agree
---
I think you have to get used to it 
---
Because after a while at looking at the remodel I thought the new one looked bland and weird
---
That’s a hot take if I’ve ever heard one
---
I’m at 6k and still don’t have a legendary..
---
He doesn't have one tho
---
Lol
---
Congratulations, you are another toxic kid who don't understand the meaning of this post, so you just hate it.
---
What did the model ever do to u feelsbad
---
Literally idk why you say ‘’12 year old’’, and I didn’t see a post talking like that from the skin and I was all the say checking for information of the realease of the update
---
You learn something new everyday
---
No emojis
---
And Chief Pat
---
Both of these profiles scare the shit outta me
---
Well, I said its not shit but its also not good
---
+6K players are the pros B)
---
Gloves? Your saying the bad part about her remodel is that she has no gloves? Bro, supercell fucking *DE-THICKEND* her.
---
This makes the icon so much better
---
Goodception
---
Same; I couldn't sleep last night because I was thinking about the update.
---
**The Next Day:** 
---
Me: Where's the update?
---
Would you buy mega box with star point？
---
Ban Aids
---
You are a legend, and we need more people like you who contribute to the community! Thanks!
---
With no teeth tho
---
What happened to my boi OJ
---
I mean technically from their view the female colt is the left one...
---
And that's what they get those cheeky fuckers XD
---
Epic.
---
Bruh, tell me why they out here removing all the good maps....BUT KEPT CAVERN CHURN 🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
---
Bad luck you Will get it in your next smallbox ;)
---
agreed
---
Actual icon is good tho so there's no need to change it
---
I can't receive request.... sorry :(
---
B ball
---
There is no escape
---
Was already posted. Gotta be quicker next time
---
Let's not ignore the fact that its 50% Shelly's, 30%bulls, and 20% other brawlers.
---
Trash map.
---
can we initiate the "Screw Brawl Ball" club?
---
Do something with the clubs, like you did in clash royale. Maybe club wars or something like that. That would be really fun
---
Oop my bad
---
I see Carl a little bit
---
Don’t even remind me of the “Buff Mortis” era, it was pure chaos and anarchy where there was only two sides, those being “Buff Mortis” and “Don’t Buff Mortis” with the few stragglers of “Nerf Mortis” who were inconsequently swept under the metaphorical rug
---
Skull creek was good imo
---
Awww.. His trying to try again &lt;:3
---
Yeah cause brock didn’t get his remodel recently. The only one I’ll make an exception for is Rico. But people really complaining even though they’ll get over it in a week
---
U water markers it and all u Sid was add teeth and change the eyebrow color bruh
---
come on its a quarter of what he did before is not gonna be that horrible (i think)
---
You draw it for fun?
---
Mmmm yes
---
Just doing a favor, no need to thank me.
---
Ricochet will be the only missed one, the rest got good remodels
---
I always wonderd dosent anybody who played BS like 10 matches relises this is fake maps/scenario
---
Omigod i was one of the first people to post a remodel HoW dO yOu gEt yOuR pOsT sO pOpuLaR
---
I kinda liked skinty rico, matched the skinty barley thing
---
Removed - DO NOT SUBMIT POSTS WITH TITLES IN ALL CAPS. CAPS LOCK IS CRUISE CONTROL FOR COOL

ya, that would make it much nicer

This Amazing great job✨😄✨

This is*

Wow awesome job!! 👏🏼. My favorite nita skin idea so far!!
---
I don't have a credit card

Waouhhhh sooo cool ! Instabuy;)

Thanks! I’ll PM you my code!
---
Thanks 😇😇🦖

I got him 6 months ago
---
Thico gang
---
The Wii too but it didn't really make a lot of money... However it did have Netflix and YouTube... Which at the time was like *Wow*. Also you can play your childhood GameCube games in the Wii...
---
I never even thought of that! 😂
---
El primo and 8bit share the voiceline you lose
---
Both look awful
---
Skin idea; Cactus spike
---
Dude just stop you karma begging idiot
---
Bad husband lol
---
I can imagine how hularious will the dynasour look when attacking with his tiny hands 😅
---
Skin idea; Human shelly
---
Eyes are too big
---
Wii was one of the bestselling consoles of all time dude
---
i think we should have weekly discussion threads where a game developer or moderator comes out and answers a few questions, basically a weekly q and a to keep us in touch about supercell's progress. it would be good for maintaining hype and satisfying some of the loyal fan base always complaining about updates.
---
You mean Brawl Stars was so popular otherwise I'm gonna need an explanation for crows and cacti.
---
Did you make it there??? It is only 200 though, i got 13k (14k max) so its pretty easy.
---
Wow
---
Yeah and they are certainly not wizards who can update the game in a flash.
---
I’m not complaining but I think the supercell team could have kept the original one
---
Hopefully we can report stupid randoms
---
Never gonna give you up
---
Skin idea: Skeleton Poco
---
Never gonna let you down
---
Why does the rework look more official than the original to me??
---
and the 2nd star power is quite op
---
You guys are being a little over dramatic.
---
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
how was it balanced in any way, the end game was always the same thing being 4 brawlers stuck on the corners and since there is only 2 entries to mid it made huge choke points. this map was horrible and the only good part about it was u could hide in the storm if there were teamers cause of mushrooms.
---
Como conseguiu ser suporte?
---
Well if the mods could take action by deleting repetive post in this sub could help.
---
Haha, we made the same exact post (although I deleted mine)
---
?????
---
And even if the update is very good they demand even more stuff
---
Amazing work
---
they only made two heavys throughout the year tho?
---
F
---
She looks like a little girl on the new model
---
i really liked it too idk why everyone saying it's  ripoff
---
Oh wow Supercell have to do this 🤩
---
They make her look younger, like a teenager. While her voice sounds like a woman in her 30s or 40s, which is very well suited to her current model. But still I am okay with that, just that her umbrella looks really odd.
---
I can tell you worked hard on the drawing.
---
You can also draw in heist/siege if the % on both heist/turrets are the same and time runs out, but this is something different.
---
Now she has snake eyes!
---
It's missing teeth and she has black eyebrows instead of blonde ones which make no sense. It's not ugly, your right, it's just wrong.
---
i agree, brawl ball is so bad and it’s so cancerous playing with randoms
---
Oh god what joke am I missing
---
And then he got his first console
---
lol im an f2p player and i have loads of star points, can easily get 15 mega boxes on release day
---
I think the fence and barrel should be a few tiles up. In the vid the enemy's goal was fine.
---
I LOVE cute models like carl
---
And tick
---
I hope with the offer I can get the skin, I have 60 gems
---
Times are just an example, based mostly on when I personally see new game modes/maps. Times for option 2 are also slightly staggered to make the image less messy.
---
u/BrawlStarReyYT: am I a kick butt joke to you?
---
I love rey and kairos
---
Because supercell bankrolls fake yt'ers as marketing, gives them insider info, helps them build the game, they promote them literally in game... ityou cant take their opinions seriously they aee employees of brawlstars
---
What's the point of 50 gold, make it at leasr 200 per 24 hrs, not 50!
---
Tie me up by the bed. Step on my cubes
---
I don’t have any of the Mortis star powers
---
Lets play
---
Not much of a evil for giving away free brawler instead of putting it as legendary
---
I’m gonna be honest, the remodel is ok but the icon...ugh.
---
New look dummy thicc
---
That is !

I fucking called it bruh lol. Took me 5 mins to find my comment again

Nice nice nice
---
Wait untill u get roll-reload or what it is then u Can play him very wild
---
The image doesn't show up
---
Tbh i had never see this format here, but i just wanted to contribute here :/

Pfft her eyebrows aren't blond! That's how I can tell it's photoshop😎
---
More like he doesn't have dignity

Same
---
Legit, it were desigen for bull shelly and bo lmao.
---
Awesome map.
---
How to display the image

What's insanely long? 1 hour? 30 minutes?

At least he doesn't have Shelly as his best brawler

Yep

Then why the fuck are you complaining if you know it's not final are you doing it for the sake of it or maybe cause everyone else is doing it
---
Piper already a god at sniping when closing both her eyes.
---
NO YOU WON'T GET ON THE MOTJERFUCKING GROUND
---
Bad teammates, campers, teamers, etc.
---
I don’t thing he’ll disappear for long enough period of time for you to be tempered to go for those cubes. It’ll be immediate. Like band aid.
---
no you won't put your ****ing hands up
---
🤦‍♀️
---
#very true
---
Even the pupils are wider, it would be nice
---
(Sry for bad english)
---
Exquisite!
---
Yeah but you made it so big that it looks even worse, and the mouth was already good
---
And that is not a triple kill. You just killed 3 Brawlers. Triple kill would be killing them with the same attack
---
#I SAW DAT ON INSTA TO. AJAHAJJAHAHAJAHABAHJAJAHAHAJAJHABAN

The gloves make she look older
---
Snappy Sniping is why she is evil *evil woman laughter*

Perfection

Very satisfying to see it, karma slap him lol

How is brawl ball being a permanent gamemode a little feature...
---
Stop.  Nice meme
---
To his piper
---
The thing is once u reach rank 35, u drop back down when season ends...

I disagree, but they stated on twitter it's not the finished one and Frank stated the one they have is looking 🔥
---
Stone
---
He jumps with one arm and poses.
---
/u/weebdude69 Where did you see Mortis getting an animation rework?
---
Actually, 3. Bibi has enough HP to be considered as a heavy
---
So Rosa, Bibi and 8-Bit
---
Bruh, I have never had that experience. I'm 14k and everytime I played eye of the storm there would only be about 3 Shelly's.
---
The rest were of a wide variety of brawlers.
---
Cavern churn is just for Shelly's and bulls. U might get 2 different brawlers but that's a big if.
---
r/shittybrawlstars
---
I missed my chance. I just took a photo of it. I totally regret it now:)
---
Do you know what's better idea bring the old one back
---
Finally she's in heaven with her Bf Ricochet
---
Why are people downvoting you? Is it wrong to give an opinion? I like the new model too.
---
This is probably the best remodel idea so far, even better than Nightwitch Mortis
---
I love her remodel. But I just prefer her old model. Plus her new icon is just.... ew
---
Well if you turn around the first one its *( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)*
---
Spike’s super works too
---
From OJ, Cory, Lex and Kairos!
---
I basically took all of the information from their videos and put it all together in one post. Of course, I ran out of space and couldn't put the remaining things anywhere. :)
---
Thanks a lot😁
---
Lighten the colors on the new model and she’ll look perfect. They made the new Tara too bright and the new Piper too dark lmao. 
---
That icon tho...
---
It should be today at 10:00 or 12:00
---
Liked how it was before. 500 was tough but fair to achieve, and you could push further for bragging points. Now, star points have ruined everything and trophies have been inflated beyond repair, because actual skilled ranks take too long to get to with season reset.
---
I flexed my 6k trophies before I even knew about 8-Bit
---
Supercell: *Nerfed Band-Aid
---
Community: YESSSSS

Supercell: *Adds 1-UP

Community:
---
Eh, to me downvotes are just the number of people who disagree.

And there could easily be 6 clowns in the brawl stars community.
---
Where u from?

Germany
---
I’m from uk you have a different time
---
Jessie + drug dealer = new piper model
---
True true
---
Согласен.
---
Thats amazing!!!
---
Remodeler Piper is good
---
I cant stop laughing XD
---
Does her voice even fit now? Her voice lines sound like a grown women not a teenager.
---
Oh I didn't notice the Mortis rework mentioned from Lex or Kairos videos. Cool job.
---
I can’t believe they didn’t buff shocky.
---
Better is buff Pam's super than her first sp
---
Thanks for the giveaway! I think there should be more threads for recruiting. I don’t see them very often.
---
There are some incorrect informations tho

Sad Rey, Bentimm1 and OJ noises
---
As soon as I saw the Art Style, I already knew it was you.. Good job tho
---
I didn't sleep at all
---
What?
---
Piper remodel is not a default skin
---
Piper remodel is a 500 star points skin
---
When is New update?
---
The new remodel is younger, yet has no teeth...grandma is that you?
---
Where is dynamike?
---
If you’re trying to max him probably. I usually buy them for the ones I’m trying to get star powers for
---
what do you mean by dead? She doesn't express emotions?
---
I feel that he's 2 weak after getting nerfed. Or am I wrong?
---
I like it
---
But it has some problems
---
But with it or without it it looks cute
---
Ok thx
---
lol better

Man, that kills a lot of the hype for me for the update. I thought they were actual,y correcting their mistake of the terrible end season rewards from last update
---
Ok
---
k
---
I'm missing all legendaries at 14k

A shitty repost asking for something in the past. Thiccochet is superior.

Yep, added and removed maps for Bounty are invest. Shelly's +200 is due to copypaste and shouldn't be there. And Leon's heal is from 600 to 800
---
Eeeeel Robooooo
---
that would really work in the loading screen
---
Brawl talk already came out, just wait one day. It's already a step forward we haven't seen in ten weeks.

The 2nd star power information is also incorrect, I'm not sure about the first one tho

New Piper icon doesn't have teeth but when you mix with Mortis,it would get teeth because Mortis is a vampire.Is this the reference?
---
wow very shitty
---
he is basically correct so...
---
I don’t really like the new icon, the only good part about it is the teeth
---
This icon is even more scary
---
I want to suck Crow's dick
---
I hate this, i managed to take to 500 trophies 23 brawlers, and i was planning once reached 500 with the last 4 brawlers to start pushing my favourite brawlers to get that shitty starpoints, and then they ruin everything. This is another update for 24/24h  players, and it sucks.
---
May she fly that unbrella in peace
---
*Does nobody even know about the new heist map, Figure 8?*
---
lit!
---
The remodel is awesome, the icon is bad
---
Used to be a game mode where you didn’t heal at all throughout the match, you took damage over and over again till a mushroom spawned. The mushrooms where the only way you could heal in showdown and I was really fun, fast trophies if you where good at it. Also I’m pretty sure they did do a swap before because I vividly remeber there being energy juice on this map 🙌🏼😎
---
Yeah. I was planning to buy 10 mega boxes (have 15000 starpoints), guess I'll have to wait and be slowly spending them every season.
---
Will the update really becoming out "Tomorrow"
---
I don't think people like brawlball more than siege, bounty and heist combined.
---
:') No u.
---
**WE'RE BREATHTAKING**

"Your #3 makes no sense" I said assasins wait for the right moment to strike...how does that not make sense?

Nice bro! I'm pushing my Frank to nr 1 local im at 815 now and it cost me a hell of a lot of time so 1250 will be very difficult 😂

What that means...

Why?

This won't fit with his losing animmation

But it has not yet appeared :/

Very epic 😎

Hey you forgot to shave her eyebrows!

That's the best modifier so shut up you crying bitch
---
At least l don't look stupid in comparison to you writing "it's not dumbass" in my comments and l as said BEFORE stop using dumbass its starting to get old
---
Bruh wtf
---
Because you agreed with him in quotes and then said he contradicted himself when you failed to make a point lol
---
Yes please, I don't actually mind the gamemode that much, the randoms there are for some reason just so much more retarded than any other mode.
---
It‘s the hood of Germany it‘s located in Bonn 53 gang you know ✌️
---
I know Brawl Stars is more than a wild west game. I just don't they should target every single element that is wild west. They have been adding a lots of robots lately and I like those.
---
We all have opinions ;&gt;
---
Supers up and doesn’t come back down
---
yes
---
I hope so 🤞🤞🤞
---
Re read and see if it makes more sense.
---
Yeah but not the legitimate way
---
Good for you seige heist and bounty will always be available so you should be happy for yourself and others !
---
I dis that with jessie befor the change and couldnt clumb bc randoms so stop
---
Bo 1st starpower will be now 5 tiles wide/ adds 3 tiles of sight, not 4
---
I'm at 14K+ and most people that i get matched up with are around 8-9K trophies and like 80% of them suck

And yet 600 trophies was hard enough for me.
---
YOOOOOOOO OMG!!!
---
His mouth's different too
---
He'd still be shaking
---
Ok.... I found sugar type 1 to add to tea for £10
---
Inb4 people complaining they can't maintain their trophy level to get new ranks...
---
No robo: every one teaming  VS with robo : no teamer
---
Fute=))
---
Ya i think his teeth are smaller or something
---
Sweaty Taints
---
I'm shaking~
---
I see your having nad day as well
---
Many👏emojis👏=NORMIE👏
---
There is still teaming even with a robo
---
Well to be honest... it's a really playable map, i love it
---
Look at that black hole!
---
Why do you think so?
---
maybe narrower teeth, they fill up her entire mouth, but yeah, looks a lot better than the current piper. she looks like she's gone to the dentist to get her theet pulled out
---
The eye doesn't match her eyes in the remodel, you made the pupil into a circle
---
I seriously don’t know what you’re fighting for lmao
---
What if had all 3 legendaries before I had Mike on my mini? Double like? Dislike? What?
---
This will probably give me endless nightmares

---
I'm fine with the remodel but I like the old one better, she looked like a royal princess/lady and now she looks like a teen- The icon definitely isnt good :T
---
Where are th power cubes
---
Wait, so you mean mindless trophy grinding is fine now? The completely ruined gold economy, making it harder to max out brawlers when new ones are coming out every 6-8 weeks is fine?
---
Hmmm how about crediting people first before you POST
---
Nah +1250
---
You should have put the old Brock, Mortis, Nita etc. You should also have put the Minigunner (Did you play in beta?).

STOLEN MEME TAKE MY DOWN VOTE
---
Bad luck. She was just lagging in the worst possible moment.
---
Ikr new players are just so dumb
---
So he said that because mortis is good against squishies he should get a buff right? So mortis bullies squishies and gets away with it.
---
So what I was saying, is that shotgunners bully mortis in the same way. Yet he wants mortis to be buffed for them aswell.
---
I have been replying to too many people lol, there may be a chance that I may not know what I'm fighting for either.
---
How was Nita x Leon ship weird?
---
Let me find a link
---
My highest is 45 with luck
---
Based on the trophies gain and loss, 800 is the new 500... Meaning they really did make ranks above the pre-rework trophies lv of 500... SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER.
---
Dude I kinda know how you feel I pushed Nita to 500 in skull creek and Nita is my all time favourite
---
I know that getting 10 gems or 2 goals wins you a game, but I can’t say the same for 90% of the people I match with.
---
Oh this is for the moonlight event
---
I know it's frustrating to be with dumb player but i'm against a report button except for hating/dangerous speech on clan.
---
SC moderator can judge with no doubt the player that has been reported for nasty message(They just have to read it).
---
Gameplay wise it's very difficult, some players can coordinate themself to report bombing someone they don't like and get him banned. 
---
Also sometime you may just have a bad connectivity and i don't think that should reportable.
---
Haha true
---
I'm at 12,5 k and got no Mortis help
---
Speak gor your self
---
If u have to ask that question there may not be an answer you will be happy with.
---
Same with boom beach
---
Yea I know him as well his salty when he loses
---
So that's why I kept dreaming about him with a Carl Costume
---
N O C O M M E N T
---
This actually looks pretty good
---
Be ready for Rank 35
---
Nice idea owo
---
More memes and game arts
---
I find that 700-800 is tough competition. It’s a nail biter each time. After 800 you get very top play till rank 35. It’s very hard. 
---
I expect more win-trading to happen at the top with top tribes helping each other achieve rank 35
---
Also, skull creek is gone ohh man.
---
Btw, I'm happy Rush Wars didn't overtake Brawl Stars.
---
Star ppwer box too cheap it would be around 7.5k?
---
I would still buy mecha crow though,  since mega boxes to me are like 400 coins boxes. Basically crown is worth 2400+ gold
---
I've never heard it hahaha, give me link pls
---
I'm really wondering what was wrong with the old icon that made them remove it.
---
In my opinion, the remodel looks just like the old icon, and the new one...kinda makes piper look like she's 4 years old, without the teeth and all.
---
It's true that it deferes in some points but the main idea is the same just executed in a slightly different fashion...
---

It needed a nerf with the buff that daryl recieved.
---
Yeah whatever
---
Hehe 😎
---
"pls Upvote" Instant i press Downvote :)
---
I didnt realize Piper was this popular until I saw the reaction against her new icon. Justifiably so!
---
No i mistyped 1 letter dumbass
---
Nah, but shes one of my highly played champs..  I usually prefer to play Leon, Spike, Bull or Pam. Wbu?
---
I think the update should be already 2 hours ago
---
slightly less
---
Here take my upvote :)
---
this doesn't make sense since temple ruins and sunstroke already exists
---
8-bit hair is gorgeous
---
Even more*
---
My phone just can't handle it sometimes...feels like it's gonna blow up.
---
But it was 2 hours ago for me already, so it means, it probably can only be tomorrow?
---
I’m also hearing worrying rumours from Coach Cory’s latest video that Siege, Bounty AND Heist will share only one slot! Like WTF. They’re making 24 hours Brawl Ball, Gem Grab and Showdown. 
---
My three favourite modes are getting lumped into one slot!
---
They need to do something. As of right now clubs are totally useless. There’s no real benefit to being in one except having people to play with.
---
Then learn from it. Everybody else seems to handle the robo. Why can't you?
---
u/uwutranslator
---
Well, I would buy it, but I still haven't maxed out my brawlers. So I wanna use the star points for improving the brawlers.
---
Swallow your soul
---
B-but the bountiful br...
---
Me too :( I love to know when they yelling next time at brawl tv. When Date, and Time to release update. etc :P
---

It'll swallow something ✌

but this guy does massive damage for spike to close up on him. not to  forget about his massive range

Always thought of that! Even tho I hoped for some brawler like Daisy because she's a funny screaming mess.

I am 12 k no star power wtf

---
They made brawl ball from brawl stars into a real thing
---
Also they didn't change Tara's either.
---
I agree with what you said except the salty part. I’m also beta day one. And I have two fully maxed accounts.
---
My wife and play with the third guy being a rando. We find it fun pushing to 800 trophies per brawler. I don’t think it’s possible to get 1250 without spamming one map with a set team for 8-10 hours straight. And even then you’ll be up against the best. 
---
500 was a nice grind before trophy inflation. Now it should be 900. 1250 is untouchable for 99% of us. Competition and trophy losses above 700 makes it very hard to push.
---
Its just the starpower darryl is better now
---
Aww man, so much for his first skin...
---
No
---
F E E T I S H
---
i think they polished penny and frank's model
---
I would say brawl ball and gem grab are probably the least forgiving game modes if you're paired with bad randoms. You can carry a team right up to the end and still end up losing because one of your teammates does something that makes you wonder if they were a mole for the other team the whole time... Heist, siege, showdown, etc, I don't get that same feeling of having to babysit my teammates. I can see how people enjoy the teamwork aspect in certain game modes but for those who rely on randoms, it can be a chore.
---
What's the point of longer seasons? At some point you can't grind much higher and everybody wants to get Starpoint rewards.
---
The new icon kinda makes piper look like a robot
---
in 2151 years 25 days and 4 minutes
---
This is a very good skin !!!
---
This was an incorrect statement
---
Idiot? 500
---
I hate brawl ball, and now is permanent. Bounty is more fun and needs more skill, but isn t permanent.
---
Or just use a random number generator from 1-27.
---
Yeah xD
---
I have plenty of brawlers to upgrade to 8 and 9, only 2 to get to 6... 50 is still a lot to get daily. Not a lot in general, a lot to get every 24 hours
---
In a few hours
---
Before anyone else says it: r/flairdoesntcheckout.

Wow dude, you have serious problem

yeah they polished his model i think penny got a polish and a change in animation too

Its me....

also me but I think I'm gonna buy this skin is so cool
---
yeah
---
KairosTime
---
Bullshit, the new system is pure grinding, spending hours playing shitty games to reach 800 every season is a lot worse than the old system where you would slowly rank up your brawler to 500 then have enjoyable games readily available.
---
Will there be a discount on the gem skins?
---
Is it just me or is Pink Piper’s hair lighter?
---
Star power: coiled snake, doubles range, but changed to increase range by 75% only after August update
---
Me considering getting up at 4AM
---
You stupid.
---
God i thaught the uwu is his mouth and the eyebrows are the eyes.
---
You are right but it's not like Piper is 7 or something and a girl dating Robot is just weird doesn't matter how old
---
I sure hope so else I won’t be a happy boi today 😭😂

That’s true. Xd

At least Eye Of The Storm is finally gone

I bought bo's skin, then i found crow, really supercell? Suffering from success

For me it looks like 12 to 15 years old

this should be the new icon

Well played bro, I remeber when I was up there. I have screenshot for proof of you desire it 🙌🏼

Instead of band-aid that there was a point in where you can hide for 20 seconds and be inmortal again
---
Much MUCH better actually looks like piper and not a weird mixture of mortis and piper
---
Didn't laugh
---
Better than the new one
---
Sorry if my post offended you. To see how many fucks I give about your criticism, look at how much likability you have. Have a great day you negative price of shit😘

Yes

his new second star power gives an additional 300 damage to his main attack when he charges his super

🎵not anymore🎵

rank 35 is ridiculous

im also gonna miss being immune to tilting

I do want to know how this got trending

Swear on my 177 gems

That’s a cool idea

Or revert the remodelling haha

I have seen this before😓

You can barely see through the cracked glass of an iPhone lol gl
---
I think it’s because it is funny and that is unique among the brawlers.

Yea but the first starpower dosen't do anything în solo.

Another round?

Happy Cake day!

Keep waiting

Em I mean it's cool, but since there is Phoenix or even Mecha superior skins for crow there is no need for Crow to have another skin so try someone else like skin for Pam or Darryl or Gene or anyone without really cool skin
---
CoC just had one aswell
---
This replace with bo 2nd star power and it's pretty good
---
Getting to 500 was to easy after the update with gaining 8 throphies so this is a good thing. I used to be 23rd now I’m not even on the leader board

Just because he ain't as broken as he was before doesnt mean he isnt good.

Dribbling us still effective because it still allows u to cover distance. I just made a great play by dribbling.
---
Exactly 😂
---
Finally someone noticed the eyes! Also it's very nice!
---
So relatable
---
Ok wow finally someone impressed me with his map, it's cool but add some cactuses cuz places where are no walls and bushes there is too much empty

Its pretty soloid and awesome piper is even cuter

i think 8bit is gonna be good in boss fight

I mean maybe this Rainbow Barley skin is cool, but with others go to 'hell'

Can you screen record it then post please

Add flair "idea" cuz this is confusing post
---
I know they have officially been declared as siblings, but still this thing doesn't make sense. I know Nita belongs to the tribe of people that can summon bears as their familiar whereas Leon belongs to the tribe of people that can go invisible like a Chameleon. So if they belong to different tribes, they must have different parents. So how they are siblings?
---
now go to rank 35!
---
The Update will be for sure all bugged... so the game will be unavailable for many hours lol just like always...
---
The community will be disappointed from now to the end of the bugged update for sure ! Cheers :D

For everyone asking for source it was confirmed on Discord.

That would make sense since the last update came around that time

I want them to keep the old icon and not make changes to it. Remodel is good but not for the icon

Pretty sure I've seen this before.

Really cool :)

Piper had a kid with handsome squidward?

Same, but most of the community prefers brawl ball over heist, and hey man if SC did this it means they're listening to the community, which is good! You can't please everybody.

Well boys we did it, Leonita is no more
---
Same thing as tara remodel,so im pretty hyped

I see her cute and badass

Frank is already slow in brawl stars … we don’t want @Frank-Supercell  slow Now
---
Wake up dude
---
Best icon work I have seen. But am I the only one that cares about that red ribbon around her waist that is now almost not visible during match ?
---
Ye I mean that could go aswell, I guess xD
---
As someone who has the OTHER shelly starpower:  
---
Good.
---
Stolen.
---
Ideally, for me, you’d have ball permanent....gem and bounty would rotate since they’re similar strategically. Same with siege and heist. Then you’d have a slot for showdown and a slot for modifier showdown/ticket events. Modifier showdowns on weekdays and ticket events on the weekends.
---
So smart sir, if you didn't said this, no one would've ever know.
---
She’s still OP so spit out

Yea, no LOL

She’s still OP

Imagine not being able to poison enemy brawlers, This post was made by crow gang.

I like playing games against equally skilled players without having to grind hundreds of trophies every 2 weeks.

I have no words for this stupidity... Bandaid was the BEST star power in the game, of course it needs to be nerfed a lot.

Why screeching solo?

If it is true then send us the link which confirms it

Hhahha yeah... special ed right? Oh yes, I wonder if that's what your parents thought of you when they had you.. an abomination. No, the reason I like emoji police is because they stop disgusting kids like you from ruining Reddit. Like I said, go back to Instagram if you don't like people telling you to stop using emojis because emojis don't belong here kiddo. May I ask, why would people trodden me? Because I'm nice to other people and they respect me for that? Yeah ok, I bet you just stay in your parents house and sit around doing nothing. I dobut you've even went outside.. so you go on a subreddit to be a pathetic upset child since you didn't get to go outside right? Ah yes.. I've already been attending therapy.. what have you been doing again? Oh yes.. staying inside all the time.. also, now why would i shoot up a school? It seems like you would since you use emojis which probably shows signs of mental problems that are going on with you.. have a good day kiddo ;)

Ok yeah its hard to push to rank 35 but rank 20 is now meaningless and its not necessary to be proud of yourself rank 20 is now not the highest rank buy its still rank 20 nothing changed they added new ranks they dont changed the old ones so whats your problem?
---
They named it iris tara i think
---
Then your team was bad.  Had nothing to do with matchmaking.
---
# NANI?
---
How so? Trophies are just time spent playing basically since there is a 50% decay over 500 every 2 weeks. The season also just ended a few days ago.
---
Wtf, I didn't saw it in Brawl Talk. It's really official emblems and it's confirmed 35 rank?
---
I think getting all brawler's to 35 is gonna be done maybe once. Like I see people going for it immediately but once someone gets it I think the appeal will go away. 
---
With 28 brawler's that is 7000 trophies where you win and get +6 or less and lose +12 or more... (1000trophies -1250)
---
The best of the best will knock out maybe 3 brawler's a season. You gotta remember resets every 2 weeks as well stunting progress.
---
Not being sarcastic. Honest :)
---
Please like it
---
Bro, the top on the right, the tiktok one
---
No as in like anything from the mega box
---
No.
---
Let's be honest, Band-Aid needed to be nerfed but Shelly needs a buff
---
I have an idea a new brawler is rez a girl who pulls 2 rings which between the two do 1000 damage the closer the better damage they do and their Ulti is 3 rings with pinches which if they hit you do 3000 of damage and they slow down your special skill may be that those hoops go straight to an enemy
---
They are the same picture.
---
can you send me a link to the orginal one because I've never seens it
---
Ooooohhhh. Damn, didn't realise that was in the pic 😅
---
I understand that most players really love Brawl Ball and hate siege, but being the minority who prefers siege kinda sucks.
---
BrUh
---
He's so fast now
---
How did you see this post and not the 1000000 other posts about things related to the brawl talk. Like 90% of the posts here are about Pipers new icon or the new brawler 8 bit.
---
r/whoosh
---
Omg That’s SO MUCH BETTER than old Piper!  The artist that made that is AMAZING!!!
---
Best animation in the game!!
---
If you can get a google translation and explain it in your title it would work
---
Guys, u gonna wait next week. The distance from the brawl talk of tick and the update in the play store was more than a week
---
His talking about Piper
---
It's Castellano not italian
---
That map is a pokeball
---
I think you meant did?
---
I kinda phased it out of my vision, like I do with actual TikTok. I just don't "see" it.
---
Btw who's your fave on the tee? Mine's Toucan.
---
# guys I'm shaking.......😂
---
This icon is really shit, so SC a little bit fucked up with 35 rank icon. Well, I just sort by new, so idk how ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
The thing is that the update was delayed because of Piper's New Animation. Now that it is fixed maybe the update will be tonight?
---
YES SHE HAS THE SNIPER SCOPE! ^but^still^no^gloves
---
Wtfffff. It's already confirmed he and Pam will get a remodel, man.
---
😂 not bob
---
So satisfying
---
That kinda sucks. Atleast there are still boxes
---
that map like a pizza
---
Still a bad sp
---
That being said, what is the purpose of the game?
---
If you can't get all brawlers to rank 35, why would you still keep playing?
---
No one needs to ask anything. These new models were planed and would happen one way or another.
---
What? You saying that now? Shit i let him free 🤦‍♂️
---
I would love to play this! Don't lose hope.
---
New piper does not have teeth? Did primo punch out her teeth?
---
i will never stop fighting against them!

I hope so heh
---
This community is just full of whiny babies and it’s embarrassing. The amount of crying over brawl talk
---
Wow underage
---
My good can you 5 year olds stop pressuring sc about the update besides if sc does released the update today without checking on bugs and glitches then the community will then pressure sc to fix the bugs and glitches again. Have a common sense kids
---
Guys I’m litterly shaking...
---
damn calm your tits, no need to be mad lmao its a joke
---
A whole week till the update???
---
It is a new brawler 4 skins boxes for star points new ranks and a lot of balance changes in 3 weeks star power are not that p2w I'm f2p and got a few of them
---
Okay, chill bro
---
So i dont mortis or tara!
---
It's not going to be a batch 5... batch 4 is the last one :)
---
Will do
---
Nothing funny
---
As always
---
Now THIS is quality content.
---
I'm not saying they should update today. Read again
---
After my calculations it is so
---
F for Piper
---
Any detailed ideas or opinions would be nice.
---
oh right
---
Maybe Tomorrow.
---
Guys does anymone know when the god damn update is
---
Yes, me too!
---
But it looks like there's still a bunch left to color... unless SC hasn't been checking them, too busy working on the update maybe?
---
I dont like your idk why.
---
No no blue piper is the cool piper (art students will understand why ;) )
---
Wow fair play, I’m 17.5k with mortis added to your collection 🙌🏼
---
Try putting less open spaces and use different patterns.
---
Everything in this game is based on luck. Even upgrading brawlers is based on luck. I've been wanting to max bibi since june and i didn't get power points in the shop or in boxes for her i  WEEKS
---
Ugh I quit
---
Nice one pal, think out side the box eh
---
Ur not funny just pathetic
---
Because the community are filled with kids who dont have patience.
---
F for Piper. She will be gone forever after this update drops
---
r/woooosh you fool
---
He just guessed... only the brawl stars team  knows when an update is gonna drop, not even the youtubers (even though it's too late so it's probably gonna drop tomorrow).
---
The OG Piper going away makes me want to cry
---
Lmao you fell for it, i feel like 10 mins is when it'll happen
---
she always was but this is even moreso
---
ok. i am going to sleep. fuck the update
---
they made her even cooler
---
Developer version
---
At me it's 20:42 so i need to wait until 22 but anyway, the update will be released soon i mean, less than a week or something.
---
NOOOOOOOO.
---
Theres something wrong. The eyebrows are not yellow
---
You’re at 9K
---
Pam because she shoots scrap and spam and Pam Rhymes with spam
---
It's not too funny but it's true 100
---
Also the reason why probadly sc still havent released the update due to the community wants them to chance piper's new icon and they are probadly working on it.
---
Apparently you haven't seen mobile games by Nintendo
---

CoC the MVP!
---
I think Piper should get a new voice, her voice sounds much like an adult. Her new remodel looks so young and it’d probably not fit her.
---
Woke
---
In nearly every free game things are base on luck and paying brawlstars is pretty f2p and that about bibi is a little unlucky but powerpoints are a little based on how long you got the brawler if I see my non maxed brawlers they are all newer than the maxed only some are out for a half a year
---
It wasn't a glitch. He didn't collect it.
---
Finally she got her expression and pose back. She looked so stiff in the previous remodel
---
I know but is bizarre
---
Yees it's so much better she looks so nicee
---
I don't think the community is filled with kids, I think most of them are adults. And this is my perspective am not sure though.

You’re the only one getting defensive and calling names here , try relaxing a bit more
---
Just my opinion , it's not stereotypical if it is actually feminine, and female players actually make the purchase just to have that girly version skin for whatever character.
---
Yes super can make whatever skins and still be neutral within the design, Doesn't mean there isn't a demand for it.
---
Thing is though, I was trying to live so when I jumped I was expecting to be free.
---
Then when the screen followed dynamike there’s a Shelly that was at the bottom of the screen so I died anyways lol
---
True and sad

Same here

---

Nope coming out sometime mid-september. If the update even drops by then...
---
Haha as soon as she notices the camera she goes back to innocent mode.
---
and white crow 80 smh maybe they know most of the player who have them, got the legendaries by buying them using gems so they already bought gems why wouldn’t they do it again for a skin for their precious brawlers? hmm

So does that mean that the update is already finished and that they're just waiting for google play's and app store's approval?

I genuinely can't be bothered anymore. Sometimes arguments are fun, they provide a challenge. This argument has been me insulting a bag of hammers. I'm genuinely convinced a bot is typing your comments, because human beings can't possibly be so brain dead. The only solace I can take from this shit show is humour. Whenever I'm feeling down, I'll just read this thread and piss myself laughing.

If a male 8Bit player meets a female 3Bit they would team immediately.

Is this acceptable :) or are no forms of faces supposed to be used

UPDATE????????  U are când se baga: ((((

The last one is spot on

Ah yes, I watch pewds too

---
Now that's some high effort.
---
Yeah those are fine
---
Still bad
---
well they did update piper's animations, so maybe they need to fix some things from the icon and maybe el primo remodel? but i don't think it's likely
---
Jesus! This made me laugh! Thanks guysm

Noooo ;&lt; I will nis the old remodel for Primo and Rudo no supercell... Why ;&lt;

cool. not like anyone cares tbh

Yes I agree because gem grab is not the best mode, I know it's easy and simple to understand but I think if they put heist and gem grab together would be better.

I agree mortis was my first 500 trophy brawler cuz he's fun I have coiled snake and it's a blast once you g at him you'll enjoy him
---
What if there's nothing to fix ?
---
How do you know?

Thanks, sorry for being a lil harsh

It's all good. Sometimes I post comments too quickly, because I prefer to say what I think in the moment rather than trying to come up with comments that will get upvotes.
---
i don't see how his star power will be op since he may get killed in start of a solo showdown match and lose the chance of the revive i would say it's situational
---
Truth is it was accidental but still looks funny 😂😭
---
Who said it had to be op?
---
I remember when the game hit global every dynamike and Brock main where freaking out from the new models

is the deadline over? I want to participate but I feel it's already over since it's been 13 days

And this, is why I don't play showdown.

Y’all should enforce better memeage; no one wants to see the latest jared complaining about the matchmaking being off by 100 trophies
---
Haha funny el primo get it he pinch and he jump and when he has ten gem,,,,,, h e jump t
---
At the end my! And DIE!!!!! Hahah laughs at the fucking joke do it now your wife’s life depends on it.
---
Ah shit here we go again ,another post begging for remodel
---
OMG THIS IS HILARIOUS NO WONDER WHY ITS HUMOR HAHAHAHA
---
So its third star power is reaching rank 7 without any trophies?
---
This is literally the best post I’ve seen today
---
we go from incest to slavery real f*cking quick
---
Do you know or remember one of the brawl talks Ryan (community manager) said meteors are going to hit groups of players 
---
I made this because meteor are still hitting single persons
---
Don't mess with my crow

I'd prefer if u just dont reply XD, Literally just woke up and saw this....😑😴😪😴😯😥
---
"I respect u enough to read your comments" reading comments imo isnt a respect thing lol...it depends if you're interested or not.
---
"Instead of comparing crow and piper, why not stay on topic and talk about why shelly is a better ranged unit than piper" well piper is one of if not the best ranged unit, doesnt mean the others cant defeat her. And I was on topic when stating that it was just a point to prove a point.
---
"Shelly's shots dont matter when talking about equal skill ppl ayers" it actually does because one of those shots dont take skill and the other does. So to the one who doesnt require skill a skilled player can hit it more often than the shot that needs skill.
---
Sorry for only addressing your last point....is this a 3d discussion? Holy shit if it is...
---
Omg the rework you did is brilliant!
---
The heads still have the background but nice idea
---
ReEEEEEEEEEPPPOOOOOSTTTTTt
---
Its not a rework though. Its more of a change. Also I like his current second star power.
---
hn ho
---
Thos with no music made me cry of laugh
---
I’ll never see piper the same way again
---
The algorithms aren't always perfect
---

---
Its cool but why did they have to take off piper's gloves though?

And what are you ganna say?
---
Supercell should take a look at this
---
MMMM PATAS
---
He'll never get them back. Uninstall and leave 1 star review is the ONLY way to go here
---
Guys he take screenshot to early i think
---
Just realised I misspelled a few things.
---
Yea, I'am so excited.
---
Guys, listen to Me I don't Want them to change him too, but It's only opinion. I think he's one of The oldest brawlers with no remodel, and I Like It, ans just like You, I think That Pam need to be remodeled, so pls don't be aggressive in this post...
---
No...I dont think I will.
---
Soon primo will be reborn.
---
His losing animation is the best in the game
---
It’s a favorite in both competitive and casual. Of course there are still people who’s favorites are Heist, Bounty, or Siege...I just don’t think adding another slot is gonna fix everything. It would make matchmaking worse and/or longer and it would make another mode 24/7, which will make even more people mad. If there *has* to be a solution, I would be to somehow integrate one of the 3 to fill the Special Event slot but still have the same amount of time in rotation as the other 2 as to not upset the community. 😉
---
I feel like they are going to make the brawlers animations look more fluidly on every update :D
---
Really?! I going to Play story Right now! He looks so beautiful! And real!
---
I don't see the problem.
---
They probably won't in this update, but seeing that there are more &amp; more brawlers, I bet they'll extend/sorta rework trophy road before christmas. I'd like for them to add an experience road or something too because right now, experience just gives ya the 20 tokens when ya rank up and the different player icons. It could have more use...
---
Ryan says not a chance
---
And give him 70 star points, 549 will not reset him but also not give him anything after season reset post update
---
Ima be honest. Brawl ball is my favorite and always has been since it was introduced.  Some days I barely play or don’t get on just because siege is instead of brawl ball, and when I do get on it’s just to play once of each match for star tokens. I think this is great because siege just doesn’t get played enough, heist is decently played, but bounty only every three days... I mean it’s a popular game mode.
---
Frank said he’ll stream him playing 8bit on Saturday.
---
Ooops I didn't noticed That before share this map :/ but Thanks for notice ;)
---
When you accidentally clicked the play again button with the worst team mates be like:
---
oh...k?
---
Teaming don't matter you can just hide for sometime and teaming don't exist on every match
---
Bro I got two mega boxes saved, 13 big boxes, and almost 200 small boxes. It’s cool though cuz now when you get 8-bit you can get him close to max and prob get other new star powers and stuff along the upgrade journey.
---
Ditto
---
Turn up your volume
---
If Supercell Read It, pls Remodel Pam, no El Primo. For Players 😂❤
---
I feel sad for your companions, but this is still funny
---
Oh sorry... It's not like I can now...
---
That is not a new skin idea u just added something to his original skin
