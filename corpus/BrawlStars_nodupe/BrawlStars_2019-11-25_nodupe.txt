Add another layer for naming yourself "Brawl Box" (saw that name while playing today)
---
Don't worry, it's the same person.
---
thx;)
---
Been using this strategy already. No idea why people are out there targeting others. It‚Äôs common sense deal damage to the boss. Killing people doesn‚Äôt give u anything except power cubes which can be good but it‚Äôs better to just keep dealing damage to the boss.
---
*r/thebrawlstarscactus flashbacks* yeah, we don‚Äôt
---
Damn that happened to me once but I was a Poco and my doding ended quickly because I couldn‚Äôt dodge a shot from Piper and I was on low health
---
Now this is a masterpiece üëå it's amazing I love how it looks like dis :D

Whoever's code you use that person gets a small percentage of any purchases. Just as a way for supercell to say thanks since creators have helped develop the games community.  Personally I don't use the codes because the devs deserve it more than creators

I have one legendary but my friend who has 4000 trophies less than me and has been playing for a year less than me has 2. How is this possible? I trust you, Supercell. But this is just plain unfair.
---
I love how it says reduced blades
---
It definitely does, but imo just getting the damage in regardless works better. If you spend really any time going for cubes it's easy to waste time and/or die and lose ranking

Or save up those free gems you get from boxes to get a 349 gem deal legendary.

Interesting collection you‚Äôve got there

I think there will be a sale that will be cheaper than 349. I only have 106 tho

but the game is 3v3?

I've always wanted to cosplay as Nita. I just am way too self conscious to ever do it. So awesome you have the strength to do this üôå
---
Here comes the toxic kids
---
Ong so lucky that means u get el primo too!
---
The only reason he is not broken in this meta is because piper is still strong.  I feel like a crow with his super can win any 1v1 in the game (except 8bit with extra life).  I think he needs a nerf to his super at least.
---
#really man, it's easy to do

I love the both of you, and everyone else on this subreddit, have an amazing day

Bo‚Äôs hat looks like a chicken because of the head and dynamikes shirt üòÇ

Yeah that's true but at least least make him good for one meta
---
you spelled Piper wrong
---
what
---
My other strategy is get a brawler which is fast like homerun bibi and try to avoid players unless if they're lower and collect cubes then at the mark of 25%-50% I approach the boss and do like 4k damage each shot and skyrocket through the ranks
---
Always love the amazing ideas you come up with Blue Bot :) Also Happy Cake Day!!

You do understand PP is filled with Shellies only because  she's the only brawler most lower trophy players have a star power for? Not because she's OP.

Poor Shelly
---
Yeah that was my first strat too, works really well if you do it right and it's definitely more fun than mine, just imo less reliable. If people really go for you you can lose all your cubes, or they don't let you close to the boss, or it's too far away and suddenly everyone starts focusing it. Good to go foe cubes when the bot's invincible though
---
I lost all three games two days in a row
---
That sounds great ngl
---
Balance for power play
---
For lose 15 power play points
---
For Draw 20 power play points
---
Now it gives you star token
---
Now you can play power play even with level 9 brawlers

(the lise has to give litle more power play points change my mind)

---
In gem grab with mortis I killed shelly (by myself and the shelly was full health)
---
 Are you following me?)))ü§ó
---
tell me the secret üôè
---
whyy? and how? showdown ends when  you or all others are dead. takedown ends when bot is dead.but lonestar has to last entire duration, it would drag the gamemode too long.
---
Why not? :)
---
No))) to anyone))
---
I don't think it's limited because brawl stars has made a partnership with LINE Friends.
---
But is duo showdown and your teammate is alive
---
There are no EMZes in Takedown above 600
---
Are you signed?)))
---
:(
---
i had a match with at least 3 EMZs at 650-700 range.
---
Wow
---
Feel bad for downvoting but I'mistening to what you said
---
YES siege suks
---
Incendiary deals a total of 6420, and Rocket No. 4 deals a total of 6160. Incendiary is better in Heist, BB, and some gem grab maps. Rocket No. 4 is better in bounty, showdown, and some gem grab, and lone star.
---
Already following you ;)
---
Also located in a desert! Coincidence? I think not.
---
But she's with Colt.
---
Huh...maybe I don't play this mode enough but only saw Emz when my own Emz used to have very low trophies
---
You tell me!
---
this is so true, people who never play power play would enter with randoms and throw, thinking ‚Äú5 is better than nothing‚Äù.
---
Never mind, it is a legendary brawler but I guess you wouldn‚Äôt understand
---
no me, i ONLY play takedown for the star token, then i never touch it again
---
Yeah it would solve it
---
Why not take a... TRAIN TO BUSAN?
---
Same lol
---
Usu≈Ñ to ku##a

---
Leon ia my only max brawler
---
lone star i will play a bit more, i think the meta is a bit more forgiving, but in takedown all the high DPS brawlers just win. the strategy is not fun (not attacking enemy players, not charging your super) and the people are toxic lmao
---
Twins
---
yeah so dont complain about randoms because leon is shit in 3v3s
---
You have earned the NO LIFE achievment, congrats!
---
The reason I find those joke unfunny is because I don't have Leon, and I have been destroyed by Leons in Lone Star and Showdown too many times. It is true that his super indeed sucks too much now, but I think he needs a damage nerf. His dmg input is too high, basically clapping anyone in an instant. However, his super should be reworked to 8 sec. I have rarely been ambushed by invis leon, rather bush camping leons.

---
I already posted my own drawing somewhere in this subreddit, you can look at it if you don't know what I mean
---
2,5 years i‚Äôve been playing this game never seen something quite like this
---
I think the "your max trophies doesn't affect the matchmaking" really is a myth.
---
In my experience the team that get the third robot almost always win. So even if you couldn't get the first two robots it's ok as long as you keep getting at least a few bolts to attempt the third. 
---
Also, a lot of people run after kills instead of bolts. Make sure you prioritize getting the bolts over everything else. I play mainly Bibi and I just keep running from one bolt to the other, using attacks only to get enemies off me. 
---
But I guess it's a matter of opinion. I myself dont like brawl ball and showdown like most people do.
---
It's a duo match
---
they could just copy some of mario party game modes to put on brawl stars it'd be better than theses two hated modes
---
Nah, gem grab is always fun.
---
You should play all modes equally.
---
BRAWL BALL
---
I know this guy üò≠
---
And most of people don't buy it
---
it happened to me,but it was pretty fast
---
Even if I take max colt, there'll always be that dude with 78 powercubes that keeps killing me.
---
I like lone Star, I just wished it didn't revolve around kill stealing
---
Is there a chart to find out how many star points you get?
---
Takedown and Lone Star have duo!?
---
Probably not, maybe it's to catch that baby shark money
---
Fricking siege.
---
Even with teammates, siege is so boring
---
Idk its the worst 3v3 mode imo

No problem, I bet yours gets more upvotes though lol mine got 1.2k

Hey i have a question.
---
How do i get shelly, mortis, etc... Flairs?
---
....repost.
---
Do you know WHO delete your post..?
---
Yeah but there‚Äôs people like me who earn a good amount and still need ALOT of coins
---
I feel like 8-Bit would either go really slowly or Mach 5 with no inbetween
---
These two modes were rushed and poorly executed. There are so many flaws compared to the other modes. Idk if they‚Äôll fix them because I don‚Äôt see them fixing old issues.
---
And what about the history and the sheep Leon?
---
Well not the brawler, just skill, people suck at actually getting the kills quickly enough for them to not get stolen
---
Ok, I don't want to restart the same thing again and again but just know that I personnaly think hat is better, you don't think so and everyone can think what he wants ok ?
---
Takedown good, Lone Star bad.
---
That's unfortunate.
---
This was inspired by a game I remember playing at low trophies as Poco versus a Dynamike.
---
Nobody knows what they're doing at 0 trophies, so when I was low trophies I remember just walking as Poco toward the fleeing Dynamike that would just keep autoaiming and missing, while I kept doing a measly 660 damage to him. Now that I look back onto it it makes me laugh because I was basically playing aggro Poco even though I only did 660 damage.
---
It was so funny I made this. Here's my art, in all its terrible glory. I suck, but at least I tried :)
---
Cheers!

It was just a joke lmao

Attacking players in takedown is a stradegy

This subreddit and the community:im gona pettend I didnt see that
---
Yeah sad truth... HE's my second favourite Brawler
---
Its obviously crow
---
I support the bot
---
Yes! Although Bibi might be quite OP in this gamemode, and El Primo. Or anyone who can increase speed or jump. They might need to balance it out.
---
I love takedown. Lone star can die
---
Same to me
---
Very good
---
The only play takedown when I want to get trophies for Colt, other then that I really don‚Äôt play these modes because they so annoying 
---
Takedown really needs to be fix because I‚Äôm tired of idiots shooting at me when the boss is right in front of them and getting spawn across the map from the boss. 
---
Lone star isn‚Äôt as frustrating as takedown but I‚Äôm still not a fan of it and would rather play other modes
---
u/Memesthememe already allow him to draw it when he post pink piper and sakura spike
---
Yeah, but the wounding one‚Äôs not as good :/
---
I'm the other way around, I love takedown but hate lone star

What is name this aplication

Tis but an absolute... Nevermind.
---
Yes, me2
---
Honestly. They should replace it with a big box.

Congrats, in my opinion doin that or farm gems to buy the offer like the one you had on the shop for Crow, are the best options for f2p, don't give up guys ur time will come tho

Poco??? How Tara? And not poco???
---
just hit 8K week ago, but everytime im like 1 more win chinese people exist in matchmaking
---
Just a little background info: I got my buddy Kyle prior to the release of brawlstars global. When bstars came out one of my favorite past time hobbies turned into playing leon by kyles cage at night. It turned into a bonding moment so I tried adding some bstars plushies to the mix.....he hated that.....One of my previous posts of Kyle months ago was him giving a Poco plushie the evil eye....so I had to wait to get him something Leon related. After keeping up with the brawlstars world's a bunch of my favorite players allowed the community to acquire some of their merch. SLASH my dude. You made this moment happen. Kyle loves snatching snacks off it and it just means alot more to me to wear around!
---
Leon star power 3: TONGUE POP "when Leon enters his ultimate 6 lollipops shoot from outside his mouth (like my boi Kyle eating) and hit enemies for 800 damage.
---
How do you mean 1250 starpoints are 20K gold?? Dafuq
---
Just saying, star points are meant to be endgame stuff, us endgame people have boatloads of gold
---
You are not PREPARED!
---
Why are you booing me, I‚Äôm right
---
This is way more cool than the existing one...
---
So you mean you killed the Bull with Poco?
---
Get my upvote!
---
Don‚Äôt shout at me
---
These are quickly becoming my favorite modes. Reason being, randoms can't bring you down and there's no real teaming. Therefore, more often than not, skill = trophies.
---
i did

Feel the hatred of ten thousand years!

Seems like it‚Äôs be a bit similar to brawl ball. 
---
Running to the center to get the flag/ball, and then trying to take it to one end of the map. The only difference would be which direction you were going.
---
 *Laughs in 517 upvotes now*
---
Vinkev the people who collect all the power cubes are annoying because when you get to 12916 trophies, (cough cough me) you find someone doing that in every game and they almost always get 1-4 place even though they spent half the game collecting power cubes and spent so much less effort than the people who were actually playing the game. It just seems like a very unfair and lazy way to win in a  game that used to be fun.

Okay i get it...something like tournament..8 ball pool does similar kind of tournaments.

I think it will be a good idea to include them
---
No ur not. People in ur server just have names with Asian characters
---
Also in Emz and Spike's supers
---
Today on things that never happened
---
Yeah but then what‚Äôs the point of star points. They‚Äôre supposed to be a reward for reaching high trophies, not be another coin.

The slow supers like emz and spike dont stack

Then why did you ask

Well majority of the trophies from 500-1000 I pushed him in brawl ball and gem grab and I'll say that he is better in brawl ball.From 950-1000 I did it in duos and I'll say that he is a really good pick there,you just have to be aware of pipers and other long range brawlers.Dont overextend with him too much,he can't be played as an aggro brawler.Your best brawlers to jump on are: Colt,Piper,throwers,Another crow,sandy,emz,Jessie,penny and Poco and ofcourse if some of these brawlers have super such as tick or emz or Jessie try avoiding them.And you can also jump on some brawlers when they're under 4 or 3k hp except tanks that have their super charged or can two shot you.

Hope dies last

I thought it was from Ltt reddit
---
This drawing style is;excellent,amazing,great,wonderful,brilliant,good,nice,magnificent and amazing!
---
you just found the two greatest dumbasses in brawl stars
---
1043, can relate
---
I really hoped I could gat it but it never got in
---
Get
---
I would spend all my starpoints in gold ngl
---
I absolutely love it!!
---
xDDDD
---
exactly same thing with me. This problem existed since the day it released (beta). and they still never fixed this. and you know whats even worse? people who keeping saying that its my wifi faulth and not the servers...
---
I think there should be more star points when you reach rank 5, 10 and 15
---
games usually dont need downloading speed. just the ping
---
Do you have a yt channel?
---
At least its hollow and he had some good frog stew hmmm Shrek would love that üòã
---
I don't know how to continue the line üòê
---
Well yeah the same thing has happened to me yesterday.One match other teams just camp in bushes and get out of them when the zone closes and then they get obliterated by the team with most cubes,but in the second match the team that has the range and power cube advantage bullies you the whole game and pushes you in other teams which gets you and your teammate killed.I pushed him in duos from 950-1000 because he just isn't meta in brawl ball and gem grab(where I pushed the majority of the trophies) because of the current meta and I think that I would never get him to 1k if I didn't try in duo sd.

First Pam fan art I‚Äôve seen in a while, but the art looks really great! :)
---
Makes sence.... good job!!
---
Takedown us playable but not lone star. Lone star sucks
---
Super through the gap
---
Not funny didn‚Äôt laugh but hey git gud
---
Nah. I'm think about it tho.
---
VERY dumb
---
It's weird
---
You guys are getting brawlers?
---
The last two are hilarious. Jessie belongs to the nerds though
---
The internet for brawl stars depends on their servers
---
thanks
---
If someone mocks him he shows his blades.... and his guns
---
looks good
---
Well you had choose an email that was already existent so google add 3 number on it.....
---
So you should note it or try a different email....
---
SHETƒ∞SARA
---
Is 1000 what we should be aspiring to? Serious question.
---
i actually like lonestar but yeah i absolutely hate takedown
---
You monster you ruined everything
---
What?
---
Lone star could be better, maybe if it didn't depend on stealing the most kills or if they reworked the scoring it would improve the experience. Also takedown just plainly sucks, it's the game mode I hate the most, I'd play it only to get the star token at the expense of -10 trophies or so and then forget about it. Maybe it could be improved if supercell limited the amount of power cubes players can have at anytime to like 8 or something like that, because when any player has 14 they just become unstoppable.
---
I personally don't even play them for the star tokens I prefer having to wait an entire year to get a regular box than play either of those game modes.
---
tbh COD is good but i uninstalled it after some weeks, it was kinda boring
---
Just opinions, no hate
---
O sorry
---
Same here
---
No that wasn't me
---
Check this https://www.instagram.com/p/B47GWFDFWL4/?igshid=khgdgsdbe0h5 ü§ó I used a wig for Jessie's hair and I made some nice braids üôÜüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Wrong use of the format

Thank you!! ü•∞

I think there should be an IQ test for every game so idiots that think they are invincible and just run towards the entire enemy team like they are the big boss or something just don't appear
---
She's in my list of future projects!
---
M-M-M-MONSTER KILL
---
mostly randoms.
---
there wasn't any other email like this sooooo
---
The name i chose is very hard to copy
---
My friend got crow in 500 trophies on his secondary account!
---
i think 4 points for a coin is fair... 1000 points for 250 gold
---
Couldnt agree more.
---
Underrated
---
Oh no no no no üòÇ
---
Im okay with Lone Star but Takedown is a nightmare if I am using my brawlers under 500 since the idiots there think its Showdown with Angry Robo.
---
Nah how about snowbrawl
---
Three actually lol
---
Me too
---
If only all gems looked like that, my life would be complete.
---
"Why it's still empty?"
---
Come on, supercell only makes about few billions per year, how can they solve a problem with bad code/servers? Don't be silly
---
Started today with 832. Ended up with three losses and 847 points.
---
BTW, if there's anyone out there that can draw this digitally for me, I need it for a server banner. Thanks!
---
SAME HERE
---
Bruuuuuuh
---
+points?
---
Same with the game
---
Can I have the download?
---
Name yourself r/brawlstars

This meme has gotta go üòÇ

Jessie is a top tier brawler imo, people just can't play something other than crow or shelly
---
I have 81, but i'm keeping them for the update to buy recent skins
---
Hedge Honcho from Mario party ds my favorite mini game
---
I didn't think that could possibly be true, so I went and looked it up. [Yowza!](https://www.statista.com/statistics/298766/supercell-annual-revenue/)
---
I dont even play them to avoid rage
---
Game: should i give him a legendary or not
---
Teeth
---
Shotty&gt;Shovel
---
I feel lone star would be a way better game mode if it had duos.
---
Those two game modes shouldn‚Äôt be in power play though. They are less skill based and many random occurrences come in play to determine the outcome than any other game modes.
---
Nice
---
lmao
---
Tables turn*
---
Me:playing Mortis and crying in the corner for not having a legendary
---
Leon be like

r/lostredditors

This has no effort put into it
---
Next Update:
---
Brawl Talk: The biggest update yet!
---
Looking forward to seeing that ;)
---
They‚Äôre both bad but Takedown is the worst.
---
Wow supercell really be copying from clash of clans ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
There was no joke there what
---
If only you could use Brawler Skins as icons....
---
I really don‚Äôt get why people hate Takedown. It‚Äôs a reasonably well-balanced mode, the meta is pretty wide, and if you‚Äôre good at it you can almost always place well - you‚Äôre a whole lot less likely to get bullied by multiple players in Takedown than Showdown or Lone Star.
---
actually 1250 powerplay points would be 2500 gold
---
Happy birthday
---
XD wait I'm sorry I looked at colt agien XD
---
It's a good one, but in case they improve it, I just hope it doesn't affect the progress in a big part.
---
By the way, how do you do to get responded by a real person and not by a bot?
---
Because, in my case, no matter what I tell them, no matter how many times I send my questions, a bot will always respond me "Hi! This is the automatic support system, please select one of the options below". And when they say "Have we solved all your doubts?" I press "no" and say my question again. But it's the same thing, the bot will respond the same.
