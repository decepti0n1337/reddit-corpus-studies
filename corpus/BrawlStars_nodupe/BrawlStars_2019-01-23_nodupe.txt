I don't know tho ive specifically never had problems, but if I ever make another brawl ball map ill thunk about it

Nah, man, Mortis is super easy to use in showdown. All you have to do is run away, and you can get an easy 2nd place almost every time.

I've done pretty well with El Primos going absolute ape on people in Gem grab, to the point where I don't mind it. My problem is the people who just stand right in the middle and continue to attack (ALONE) as a brawler with low health.
---
They're hold 14 gems and feel the need to run and grab the 1 gem that just popped up when the enemy team has 3. Idiot always dies and gives up the match.

I am convinced that 95% of these matches are bots because even incest can't be this stupid.

yes it does the higher trophies you at the more you lose i should know because when  i push with my crow over 500 trophies one loss take away 6 trophies. While a noob with barely 60 trophies only losses very little but gains a lot to help them push higher in rank. As you continue to get better at the game you start losing more, watch this professional brawl stars player .https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC874WmmCVtIwTG4gQbWHKUQ

There's no incentive to leave your mine unless you want to get 1 v 3 or lose a 3 v 3 because you are on their side. 
---
This is so true lol
---
Love this
---
So you have a vest wearing cactus, grave-digging bats, a killer biker crow, and if you stop to explain, you‚Äôre a goner
---
Why 3 points? It'll be longer that brawl ball bevause of the longer distance. Maybe just 1 or 2.

Mamma mia pizzeria!

When you stack cubes in early game, you get an insanely huge advantage in late game.

-kill bull with Shelly 10 times
---
-win gem grab by carrying more than 5 gems
---
    Etc.
---
Actually, Brawl Stars connection is a shit for a considerable number of players, lags is commun, we really want a good update by Supercell.
---
You cant push every brawler in solo, IMO 3v3 game modes are a lot more fun
---
I was on like 100 hp with tara and the primo with 10 gems chased me all the way to my side of the map and died. 
---
Symmetry isn‚Äôt required, there‚Äôs no rule for it

Wait.... WAIT LISTEN TO THIS.... Add flossing emotes.

What did you expect, people aren't pros at the start. Bet you that there might be someone complaining about you in another post.
---
he is faster then tanks, slower then mortis, crow, leon.
---
*lose 100 more trophies on crow
---
I doubt it, because unlike most of my team mates I actually play smart and strategically. Issue is that no one else does
---
Then the dev team should do what they did with Darryl, he was to strong in heist but weak in other modes so a slight rework might help
---
üòÅüòÇ
---
This! Legit, my teammates will always steal all the gems (which I'm fine with unless....) and then when the countdown starts theyll run forward and attack the enemy instead of dropping back and then they get killed and we lose because once the enemy team grabs all the gems, everyone is too scared to go attack them... even though they have nothing to lose
---
When playing el primo your intelligence goes full hulk

I actually managed to win once by chipping chipping escaping with super chipping chipping and repeat, the Bull wasn't THAT good to be honest.

Thanks bro
---
Not quite
---
how
---
Feel bad for Pam, fell in love with Bull
---
That's just cause I don't rank up brawlers until I max them out. And I got a score on them the second game, we basically destroyed them. So yes I can say that yet were worse
---
i dont know about that one. if he can get gems, then he can make a break for it and run away with super
---
Because the mythics are rarer then most and most people won‚Äôt have those brawlers, The early trophy road and rare brawlers are the most likely to appear
---
To clarify the reason it is maxed is because I don't play them until they are lvl 9 or 10
---
I don‚Äôt miss either personally, I find it easier to play in landscape and that model looks like an alien
---
ahh gotcha
---
Just impress her with you juggling skills
---
stop calling me shelly
---
I don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôre aware of this, but there a new legendary brawler called Leon! He‚Äôs quick, stealthy, and deadly up close.
---
Should have picked Mortis 
---
They get the gems because they always kill the person who has more gems. Then they collect more and when the end they wait for him to leap to them.
---
Love the colors!

WTF I didn't notice that.... I'll fix it
---
Ye I'll fix it 
---
You have to kill to infect. Tokens are awarded by how long you stay alive as a normal brawler or how quick you infect others as an infected brawler. Infected people are stronger and faster to make the gamemode fair.
---
Being max at200 is a weird flex but OK.

Plzzzzz fix quick I love this!

What are the odds?

I'm a big fan!! Can I ask what software you used for this artwork?

I liked the portrait, buth the one with gray UI and pins &amp; badges

Charge into brock/piper face and kill em. Then go behind a wall and enjoy the lead

He's just doubling up on memes is all

Looks more like a samurai to me

I would like to see a Mary Pipers skin

I won‚Äôt give up, the game is nice but i think supercell needs to update it give it some new brawlers modes and different things.

But other than that I love it and I play it on daily basis.

I got Leon at 0.05% so it doesn't really matter. If it's gonna happen it will happen! :)
---
I'm the opposite of you 
---
I only play solo Showdown , I've grind to here i am now (6370 i think) playing 95% of the time in solo Showdown
---
You have to adapt your game style to beat the teamers 
---
To be honest i do see all the problem with them 
---
What you can do is.. 
---
You try teaming with some one 
---
And the betray then
---
That lady sees this everyday
---
Buy ..
---
Update*  there is no chance to tranfer pp to any brawlers
---
nice headshot. though you may want to clean the lineart so it will look cleaner
---
Am I the only person here who finds Mortis good for Showdown?
---
Yeah same. Just always add players you know that's good. There's always one player I notice in random that knows how I play, and we sync together.
---
Also I always click play again even if I lose, and I add the person that sticks around because I notice they're learning to play as well, or willing. Everyone leaves once they lose. 
---
It's all about knowing how the teams play style is and how you adapt to the teammates. 
---
Cause some go aggressive like a sharpshooter trying to get gems or a defensive one that stays back. Or a tank knowing how to bait the enemy to you and ki. 
---
Even if it's just one friend. Us 2 had 1 random, won probably 11 when I was at 3650?  in a row. He had a lv 6 poco and I had a lv 3 Bo within 300 trophy range, with one random every game but they would make it harder but we managed. 
---
We then went duo Showdown for the first time got 1st place 3 times in a row.
---
It's hard to find a player that plays well with your own play style, but it's easy for me to notice a player who's actually paying attention. 
---
Also knows how to not be greedy for gems (leaving some gems after a steal is needed) 
---
OR if the enemy has all the gems on their side, noobs go in and try to solo.
---
I add the ones that wait for all to respawn and stay the center and rush.
---
I'm still noob but that's just what I've noticed on how to get a comeback instead of rushing one by one and dying wasting time. Wait and go as a group.
---
This wasn't advice for you considering you're at 7k
---
But for anyone that's reading and hates gems.
---
that's one thin leon
---
i give a 4
---
Agreed. One time I got disconect just in the exact second the game was over. My team had won but I didn't receive my trophies had played the entire game and didnt receive nothing.. I gues they make that way sk people dont exploit it like entering a game and disconnecting but well I dont think that they will get far with this
---
Crt?
---
You did very well
---
And they opponent also just dropped like 3  pp then the his teammate picks it up. I agree it is so annoying.
---
Every skin worth 500 gems!
---
Thank you, i hate people who steal stuff to take credit.

300 gems
---
This is like a zombie  mode. I liked it
---
And orange juice
---
One thing they need to do is add more Maps with almost NO Bush, this will also be an indirect buff to Piper, Crow etc cuz currently the Maps favor Bulls and Shelly and Primo a lot, and since there would still be Old Maps nobody can complain. 
---
It‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs Darryl

Bull should be last brock,barley A tier this list is weird
---
Says civil war idiot
---
Oh it is nice. If ass special effect and animation, it can be meet the quality of Phoenix Crow. 
---
I am happy to spend 300 Gems on it.
---
Laughed
---
Lol I disagree, since brock and barley aren't as good close up when camping
---
Bull has unrivaled camp game and scales with distance
---
Is this a showdown tierlist? and still would be inaccurate
---
This fact must be spread
---
But this is not supposed to be a camp brawler tier list is it?
---
Mostly for showdown, but also a little general
---
And I disagree
---
Fuck it. I'm sittin' here at 4800 trophies and I still don't have Frank.
---
In the December brawl talk we didn't saw their feets. They were behind that table
---
I yesterday played some bounty and in every game ther was atleast one tank in my team and i thought why would anyone play a tank in this mode and what made it worse, at the beginning i made 2 kills so we were winning and i thought we just have to play defensive but one of the tanks just ran straight at the enemies and died then he respawned and again ran to the enemies and died, he did that for the entire game and at the end we lost
---
Love the hidden 420s and 69s
---
Crow has terrible damage
---
Sometimes you have a Leon on your team and you assume this is gonna be easy. Naah, Leon gets 0 kills and dies every 10 seconds

Easier than everyone else?

YAY SOMEONE WHO CALLS IT SNG

Vamonos!
---
Completely agreed. 
---
Still a lazy post
---
Nah, we just played frank, penny, and jessie. Just had easy enemies
---
U do realize how money exchange works right??
---
If they allow you to use bosnian money but with US prices, it would be as if supercell giving you a discount
---
if you are talking about the video in which they announced Leon and made the joke with Mortis's hat, that was not a brawl talk, it was a short one to announce the news
---
Your post has been removed, make sure to use the body of a post to elaborate on the title.

Actually it was a typo and it‚Äôs really bothering me
---
Most people grind on showdown because they can‚Äôt find friends they can trust. And if you play showdown all the time bull and Shelly aren‚Äôt to hard
---
They're still charging in dollars. The banks are doing the conversion. 
---
Mor tits
---
So team dead match ? Tdm 
---
So cute
---
Narrator: "He didnt remember."
---
Do you know how rare it is to have half the amount of mortis and half the amount of barley in one single match????
---
I always imagine as Primo is flying through the air that he's laughing maniacally at take off and then as he falls his face is like: fuck. I've got all the gems haven't I? 
---
open eyes?
---
#literally unrealistic
---
No, if they buff his normal attack at all he‚Äôs broken. 
---
I might see a slight go buff to be possible but the only way they can really buff him is through his super. Increase the damage and charge slightly while keeping the healing the same and he‚Äôll be a tad bit harder to kill.
---
The Poco skin is just AWSOME!
---
I‚Äôve just been in this place before
---
I would honestly just hide the shadow of the brawler so you only know what you get when it fully reveal. It's not fun to get spoiled by the character's shadow before it reveals. This stands for every brawlers you can get in a box obviously. Not only leggies.
---
Stuff like this proves to me I suck, good job!
---
Tbh you would be best pushing trophies in Showdown. At lower trophies, there are far too many Shelly‚Äôs and Bulls in Gem Grab and Brawl Ball. I literally win with Mortis in any game where there isn‚Äôt a Shelly on the other team
---
Where are you?

Really? I dont think its my wifi.

I somehow have spike but not a single epic and only 2 super rares, excluding Darryl. :(
---
Woooow thanks bro:D thats interesting
---
Frank is very responsive in the Twitter. But has not told anything on what they are upto. He should active in reddit more

Maybe it is today, it at least sounds like it. But wouldnt there be a set premiere available on YouTube?

Good map for rico

ILLUSION 100

I‚Äôve got mine at 250 trophies right now just playing solo showdown. Best tip I can give is to play safe and know which fights to pick. I can usually make it to top 3 by avoiding people and then just pick off the weak link when the other 2 final brawlers are fighting. 
---
Have fun never playing her again
---
*Gets Crow*
---
Ooh yeah that sounds fair enough. I hope I didn't sound so rude, now that I read my comment again lol. Nice idea btw, I used to always play infection during recess as a kid (Today's TMI)
---
Someone has been killed 1 too many times by bush campers
---
hes complaining about the star power i think
---
The game doesn‚Äôt allow overbuying or over claiming; it simply doesn‚Äôt happen. You will always end up with the exact amount.
---
It's alright. I'll use that when I play Brawl Ball. I mainly play solo right now. My strat is I hide when I'm near a box, then ambush a brawl that comes near. Then I get the weakened box. I just run if it's a tank though.
---
they were all maxed
---
Exactly. It‚Äôs a 3D environment. And you also have to take into account that some attack‚Äôs like Colt‚Äôs and Nita‚Äôs, executes attacks in a straight line, and still have a width to it. So that‚Äôs why it looks odd. 
---
Imagine if we can transfer gems to real money lmao
---
Some people consider It the best star power
---
[removed]
---
Damn, you beat me to it 
---
Nah darryl is the most fun brawler to play.
---
10/10 tho the eyes r fucked
---
So if you needed 7 powerpoints to get a Brawler max but a shop offer gives 20, you physically can't use the 20 on the Brawler you need 7 to max?
---
I hate these people who push only the shotgun brawlers. WHY DO I HAVE TO PLAY WITH PEOPLE LIKE YOU
---
What's with communist el primo üòÇ
---
With randoms? Good luck.
---
boss fight, the boss spawns where roshan is
---
He has low damage output in relation with his life, he needs a little buff with damage but is well balanced
---
its a nice skin dont underestimate the power of STARVATION 
---
Amazing job!
---
They should also change his clothes a bit
---
Ty!!! (That means thank u my mom told me)
---
How do you know you're asian?
---
He didnt say high, anyone with half a brain can dodge his shots.
---
Keep using these its what i do
---
But... should‚Äôt it be a gunner?
---
When Piper has been sticked with a fork.
---
These are really helpful! I wonder if you could do one for Tara
---
Oh .. yeah. You are right
---
the best map for penny to kill all of the troops in like 3 shots
---
It feels like something he should have instead of being an unlockable, but I do agree on thay
---
Damn, the gems in this game are way expensive
---
solo sd best gamemode for lonely bois
---
I was joking m8
---
That one penny someone drew should win imo
---
Imagine such a mode with a banishment system (to exclude Brawlers from the enemy team), if they did not take Bo away, a team of Bo, Piper and Brock would be a danger...
---
But it's a awesome Idea...
---
i dont want a shelly skin I never use her
---
Now THIS. THIS is art. 
---
I thought it was funny 
---
Oh, makes sense now haha
---

He just played showdown and killed himselfe when there were 2 left to get throphies, but don't get a sd win
---

---
WE NEED BO REMODEL
---
I feel like this is kinda big but this would be fun as a ticketed event
---
bo needs a nerf to his star power and a buff to main attack..
---
Looks like I forgot to add the logo to Darryl's hat, here's the edit: [https://imgur.com/gallery/f1t0rjt](https://imgur.com/gallery/f1t0rjt)
---
Assuming OP meant just trophy gains and it doesn't subtract for losses, that wouldn't be too difficult for a 100 person club to get in 2 weeks
---
The best are Leon, Pam, Spike, Nita, Brock, Barley,...
---
The worst are Bo (without star power), Piper (not versatile enough),... 
---
If it only gives the reward at the end of the season, then club-hopping wouldn't do anything
---
Photoshop
---
Looks like you're a new player. 
---
Hey fuckass, use a little common sense. This was drawn by a child. Show some empathy shitlicker
---
I hit 53 one game in DUOs
---
I have become so dependent on auto aim that i can't even play long range brawlers correctly :(
---
Leon is da wei
---
This is very well done!
---
Luck. 
---
Oooooo I like this a lot!
---
YES PLEASE. IM A TARA MAIN
---
Spike Wazowski
---
I both love and hate this
---
Hope it's not Photoshopped
---
More like leon carrying it's user's low skill
---
I know but if you have a full club your not gonna get everyone to get 1000 total trophies most clubs don‚Äôt have enough ppl for it or the ppl in the club are not active enough for that
---
Regular small BOX?
---
Damage buff
---
Right? I always have brain dead teammates who have no idea what they're doing despite this game being so simple.
---
Do all the brawlers and compile them into one post
---
Love it
---
OP in robo rumble
---
Interesting concept by a little hard to follow
---
Leon's super?
---
Use the one on the front page yesterday 
---
Moto G5. Worked great before the 3D update but can be iffy at times now. Not really a favourite device comment but hey it's the only one I've used to play it so let's consider it a 2 sentence review.
---
https://i.redd.it/br8jid61l7c21.jpg
---
what a nice thing to do!
---
Ok,i'll remove skull and change some details in center
---
I did because this post is nonsense and gets on my nerves.
---
This game is actually way cheaper than most pay 2 win mobile games. Everything‚Äôs just takes longer in this game. So buying stuff dramatically changes the amount of time needed to max an account.
---
If the Leon didn't auto aim and the bulls did they would kill eachother.
---
Here¬¥s my fan art

Pretty balanced map
---
This isn't a big achievement. Leon is easy to push.
---
Thanks bud
---
What's your luck? If you're buying the doubler then obviously buy the 1200 for a gem cheaper...?
---
Maybe I'm missing something.
---
A dude who is not understanding what humor is.
---
Yeah this just looks like a sharpshooter map, there should be more cover 
---
Yeah I see, but it ain‚Äòt that way
---
People can‚Äôt see Spike because he looks like a cactus and he‚Äôs hiding next to it XD
---
Same thing for Darryl, People can‚Äôt see Darryl because Darryl is actually a Barrel and he‚Äôs standing next to it! XD
---
The ULTIMATE FINAL BOSS!

this just happened to me, 6 winning streaks and then stuck

Can u like

Poor Colt... His hair is thinning. You can see his scalp through it.
---
Brock already has a rocket launcher on his shoulders why u put the team on there to
---
The sheer detail makes me cry with joy and wonder if this is the peak of humanity. 
---
The total power level comparison is only 1 different...
---
What's the best special offer though? One that includes a doubler?
---
Thank you so much for your support, this drawing took me 7 years
---
A cactus?
---
poco is good what he would get rework
---
Colt's model is more broken 
---
This hurts my eye balls and ear holes
---
What
---
Change the font and you got yourself a new member, how come I didn't think of that
---
r/woooosh
---
When you have more coins that your friends 
---
The way u play barley is why u should never play a 3v3 with randoms
---
eehhhh.....WHAT? XD
---
Thank you very much üòä
---
This would be good in a gammode 
---
No, but it may as well be
---
But how would you time your shooting when using the right stick?
---
And on mobile, you could for example abort the aiming. Could you do this on the switch too?
---
lol, I hope you are kidding
---
You see those barrels in the top left corner in the middle of the water, you should remove those because there is a possibility of a super breaking those barrels and then someone jumps or rolls on them and get stuck on that one tile spot, remember to focus more on gameplay then a visual especially when you try to put a little island completely surrounded by water where there is no escape.

Your pretty hot too baby 
---
seriously 
---
As with every brawler, auto aiming is bad with him. If you learn to not autoaim and get the habit of staying calm and taking decisions fast, you‚Äôll start to get better at him (and better at the game in general)
---
what
---
That was MEAN! üòÇ
---
THEY'LL NEVER SEE IT COMMMMMMIIIING
---
I mean debatable, but I guess it was a pretty toxic callout.
---
He didn't attack anyone until they were point black and definitely going to kill him üòÇ
---
Not as much as spike üò©
---
It kinda looks like dynamikes bird
---
I agree my spike drawing is so spot on they should put it in the game thank you so much for your support it means so much to me you have no idea
---
Anyone else having this problem?
---
(Died cuz of the screenshot :(  )
---
They doesn't even posting anything about upcoming events or changes.
---
please learn about the game before you comment
---
Now I want him in Smash Ultimate. 
---
*a cactus*
---
10/10
---
Poco note is so accurate.
---
Got a Star Player with him in Bounty.
---
So this is a relatively unpolished idea, but essentially the idea here is simple. His super will allow him to spawn at the place he last died. 
---
His regular attack allows him to boomerang his arm (penetration damage)
---
She's not rank 20 wym? Plus, why would one only play shelly?
---
Piper is balanced, but darryl needs a buff
---
the luckiest mofo. my 2 fav characters!
---
I feel you I just need crow and Leon 
---
This makes senses.
---
Very long ranged
---
was this from a regular brawl box?
---
imagine a duo getting 11 powercubes each within seconds...
---
Nice art!
---
Showdown or gem grab or bounty
---
I want spike
---
Creepy üò¨
---
Ik it's like a meme but I actually need help sooo
---
A brawler who is good in Heist, gem Grab, brawl ball, showdown and duo showdown needs a buff? OK. 
---
A brawler who is only good in Bounty and Duo showdown is balanced? OK. 
---
You‚Äôre playing Pam, which is considered much better than bull or Shelly. All you have to do is check bushes...
---
yeah I really messed this one up didn‚Äôt I 
---
Too op for bull. He‚Äôd be able to make bushes

You just wrote his name

People that cant clear boxes fast have no chamce of getting them. Thinking nita, poco, mortis. They will never be able to take a high hp box without a bull walking up with 13 power and 1 shotting it. 
---
Pro play...
---
Long raged brawlers will dominate
---
You get more gold than ussual, bcuz those power points pretty much convert into coins. i have my acc maxed (need crow) and i ussualy get more than 50+ coins
---
you live in their world where they make the demand, the value and everything its kind of empowering to thing you can achieve something like that in a digital world.

What did you use to make this?

This is dope

thats why i want to play the game with mice and keyboard

---
Thank you very much ! That's very nice of you to say \^\^
---
Loved the bear! Also... Is nita drunk...?
---
I don‚Äôt like the idea of another dashing assassin when there is already Mortis in this game. However, I can emphasize the assassin part with this skill:
---
Normal attack: Blade swipe: Santiago swings his blade, dealing high damage. The force is so strong that a gust of wind blows in front, dealing 25% of blade damage. (Unlike any other shot gunners, he only has 2 tiers of damage, but can still act like a shotgunner at close range, that makes up the assassin part)
---
Super: Santiago tosses his rapier in a straight line. Any enemy hit will be stunned. After the blade reaches max range or hits an enemy, gusts of winds blow around the blade, knocking back any enemy. Only the blade deals damage. (His super is very good at isolating targets, or even preventing enemies from running away by utilizing his super‚Äôs max range. I feel like this makes him a very good assassin).
---
Star power: Santiago can now cut bushes with any of his attacks, including his wind.
---
Piper awps down mid
---
bull, you cant see him
---
leon,YOU CANT SEE HIM
---
Congratulaton you won against a leon (op) who had like 150 trophies more and you were playing bo (worst brawler)
---
I've been saying this since switch release!!!
---
For Poco
---
You can't see him
---
What about dynamike? 
---
Got a boyfriend
---
Sometimes the shop does that, it gives you just enough power points to upgrade a brawler 
---
reuploaded because hopefully more people can see it
---
i also uploaded this to yt: https://youtu.be/f7FNB6RnpLI

Same thing, trophy road didn't exist. All brawlers were obtained from boxes

What do you mean? He spelled the brawler right ...

Hey I'm not disagreeing with you. The second Brawl Stars was launched globally, I basically stopped playing Clash Royale. I just miss the amount of good content in that sub. Don't get me wrong, there was still the normal amount of complaints and whining you get in other subs, but there were a lot of quality posts that talked strategy or showed little unknown interactions.
---
This sub is mostly memes.
---
this exposes the noobs.  Any noob says thanks and all vets say that this is dumb
---
Cool
---
Is it weird if I love this just because of the mustache 
---
u/brawlstars
---
it will be gone if you mean if you have more powerpoints then you need to upgrade a brawler to lvl 9  it wont be gone if you upgrade under  lvl 8
---
Token doublers.

here it is, hope u like it :)

3.4k only piper and still no daeryll. Damn it

The moral is kinda just a bit of comic relief tbh. Just showing that out of 100 games of "lower level" play (100-150 trophies and not bush checking") 67 times out of 100 I died to a bull hiding in a bush. And this would be the same for any character. I couldve done it wish any brawler and had the same results more or less. 
---

I was just thinking about this and you made it a reality! Very cool, would like to see every character.

Agreed! I love Rico. At first i thought he was just some crappy ripoff of Colt but the more i played the more i started to enjoy him. I still think he slightly under performs Colt but he has a uniqueness that makes up for it.
---
One buff i would like to see for this guy is when he initially fires his shots they seem a bit delayed when it comes out. I think if the starting bullets came out as you fired it would make a big difference.
---
this is harder to pull off if you are not playing against noobs
---
Even more rare than a legendary üòÇ

I never knew this! They definitely should not be random.

Great map! Would love to know how all of you guys are making these
