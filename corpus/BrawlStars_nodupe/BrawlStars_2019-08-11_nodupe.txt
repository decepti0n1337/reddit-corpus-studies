Minecraft just beat Fortnite popularity.So you mean Fortnite is better?

Yes "chinese new year" is a wrong term technically

ROYAL AGENT COLT SKIN IS A KOREAN SKIN THO
---
Idk
---
Hi, thanks for offering but I honestly don't see a meaning to that since even their vice president participates in these
---
huh what do you mean fake?
---
it‚Äôs only a theory xd
---
I‚Äôve been playing since global release
---
I'd pay 1k gems for this mode, especially when I play Gene
---
This is me when i play brawl stars 
---
Also, nice job 
---
I was cringing
---
Screeching solo still better!
---
LMMFFFAAAAOOO
---
I did the same thing, opened 40, got knowine
---
The xp at the end sounds like Gene's voicelines super fast
---
Ohhhh that makes more sense. Haha I guess I half wanted to blame the brawl stars gods for this loss
---
How do you still have level ones if you have been playing that longüòÇ
---
Brawler vs skin
---
What‚Äôs brawl party?
---
Shell shock is a very good star power, high utility
---
Yeah cause you‚Äôre such an expert on top players lol.
---
Nice.
---
Star points just get you skins. A COSMETIC! It's bad especially if your the 10% of the playerbase that is actually decent. You go into matchmaking knowing your going to get bots. It's not fun there is no such thing as a challenge present within the game. I'm F2P in both BS and CR.
---
Cute!
---
Nice
---
Oh hi pow
---
When you ran out of ideas so you get private servers star powers
---
Oh ok. I'm glad lol
---
He already got water. He is crawling from that direction. Also as a 15K player with no legendary brawlers I would take that deal.
---
But my teams piper literally jumped to bulls the whole match
---
Wow man thanks so much

Well it‚Äôs your opinion that Bibi is fine

And mine is that she needs a nerf

So we can go our separate ways

Because you're proud of 500 trophies at level 1. Great job üëç 
---
:)
---
know i'm angry
---
Yes that's true, however factually she doesnt need a nerf.
---
Price to me she needs one, use rational thinking.

Thank you Mr VX

#MATCHMAKING IS BASED ON HIGHEST TROPHY PLAYER ON THE TEAM

You, sir, are a genious. And this is a master piece!

sorted by least trophies

They should just add that to his super honestly

I have been bamboozled and apologize profusely

That's amazing, i thought the only Trolling could be scoring on yourself in Brawl Ball, now there's new methods. ;)

Hey guys! This is XampLe, a member of ‚òòÔ∏èTeam Clovers‚òòÔ∏è and just wanted to share my clip I recently got on siege. Thought we might lose this one but pulled out a CRAZY play to end it on a win, let me know what you guys think in the comments!

Hands down the funniest thing I've seen in reddit

Hey dynamaike! Just want to wish you happy birthd- *sees power cube on floor* NOOOOOO

Judging from the Crow‚Äôs name, I think they lost

Why are you so epic?

Ok, this has to be the best post on the entire subreddit so far.

What do you feel about the future of Brawl Stars?

Would you like to cover a non-supercell game? If so what would it be? Aka (what is your favourite non-supercell game)

Lmoa at first i was like damn he be trynna act like the old mortis in roborumble. And then after his ban action, oh shit we gotta kill him quick

It is, i asked him why he don't have his own youtube channel and he said that he can have all cash from lex if he work for lex, if he make hus yotutube channel, that woyld be nasty

Do the Royal hog nodding or the lion dance hog count as toxic? I sometimes use those after a win, I consider them celebrations

Exactly

I bet its Ricochet

Thank you!

I don't really think I did something that bad, I only reposted them because I genuinely thought they were good and just tried to share it. I went to search if there was any posts about this on the subreddit and I couldn't find them, so I thought they were downloaded from somewhere else. I really didn't expect all the upvotes, because that's not what I wanted.
---
Now, I didn't put any watermark on it or claim it as my own, but there's people out there who are doing it and not getting punishment.
---
Now, if you want to help the community find out actual art thieves, then **[check this one out}(https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/comy7g/fan_art_of_jessie/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)**. He stole the art and is claiming it as his own, and he even put his signature on it.

that's why you put a watermark on your oc

I was thinking it might be Shelly

The season pass made the tournament rewards really bad, other than that the updates have been well received with the trophies rewards and lower trophy losses

time to spend 4 more years getting to the end of the trophy road as well as getting all brawlers to 500 AND getting all star powers AAAAANNNDDDD getting every single skin including star skins AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD staying 1st place in terms of trophies for ever AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANNNNNNNNNNNNDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD making the best club globally  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD getting all your brawlers the highest trophy amount in the world AAAAAAAAAAAAANNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD your all done UNTILLLLLLLL THE NEXT UPDATE then you get MOREEEEE star powers .

I should be offended but tbh the joke got old fast

CAN YOU JUST WAIT SUPERCELL MAKE NEW UPDATE AND MAKE STAR POINT USEFULL.STAR POINT IS NEW IT'S JUST NEED AN UPGRADED JUST WAIT AND SHUT UP WITH YOU BLA BLA BLA.
---
I've opened a total of 127 as of today and haven't gotten a legendary. Plus 8 mega boxes and 3 big boxes. I'm big mad.
---
I would love it but that would be a licensing nightmare
---
oh yeah mr. krabs
---
you try to come up with 8 different skins with brawler models that don't work with skins.
---
How‚Äôs about replacing brawl ball and siege with a new game mode.
---
No but actually, you know how people do a copypasta and tweak a few things? Well this is a exact rip off,  not even a copypasta, nothing is tweaked a tiny bit.

SCREW YOU I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU WANT TO SAY CR IS BETTER OR WHATEVER.STFU I JUST WANT TO SAY THE GAME IS GOOD THAT'S ALL .(SORRY MY KEYBOARD BROKE DOWN SO SORRY BTW)

Oof I didn‚Äôt get what you mean at first, but now I understand. Your concern I‚Äôm pretty sure is regarding the middle most part since when the gas closes in and only that part is left, if there is a team directly on the opposite side of that block of wall, you wouldn‚Äôt be able to shoot at them. I‚Äôm thinking of replacing that wall with something else so that this will not happen, thank you for ur suggestion :3
---
I got 2 teammates just spinning in a 800 trophie game this ain't shit
---
LOL
---
Nirvana I checked the guy's account he only had shelly
---
I legit have no idea how he did this I checked his account and he only had shelly and he was playing showdown
---
why call them idiots?
---
So what your saying is that being able to dodge dynamike is a pro gamer skill?
---
Do u know what I call "pros"? Egotistical tryhards.
---
If being a "pro" means that u have skill then yes u can consider me a pro. If u consider a pro to be someone who climbs ladder and gets soy because someone passed him then u can miss me with that. If that's the case then I'm not a pro.
---
I have a Pam with first star power
---
I Usually only bet‚Äôs one or two tickets but if I bet 20 this is gonna happen to me
---
That's not me :(

How you guys have brawler name like you Jessie, someone is crow, Nita, and others.
---
Kickable at least

oh mann, ur definition of pros is surely referring to a minority only right?

Trophies does equal skill, unless you are just that person who grinds solo sd by teaming/bush camping.
---
Trophies doesn‚Äôt equal skill when you just don‚Äôt have the time to play, but u could easily wreck  players with higher trophies than you if given the chance to.
---
I agree majority of the players can dodge dynamike, but i‚Äôm just sharing a little clip, hope it doesn‚Äôt offend any of you.

Wouldn't it be way cooler, if we get to do this to our Max brawlers?
---
Like once u reach lvl 9, instead of maxing out we get this upgrade system. We can then choose different upgrades like perks or something. This would be a good endgame option, especially since the endgame kinda sucks now. Most players by then would understand the underlying game mechanics and this wouldn't be too complex for them.

The only way I can justify a No Hat Mortis is if he is doing as a ‚ÄúRite or Passage‚Äù for once he is at 500 trophies, he is worthy of wearing ‚ÄúThe Bat Hat‚Äù! I may want peace between Mortis kind and Thrower kind (and I don‚Äôt team), but even I think Not Hat Morti (who ARE NOT doing the ‚ÄúRite of Passage‚Äù thing) are ‚Äúbad‚Äù.

BrawlStars and other mobile games are like an on and off switch. Its on (the time I play) for a while then its off (the time I stop) for a long time waiting for an update. Other than PvZ2 the endless modes are fun, but PvZ2 drains the heck out of my battery, if only it was a PC and Counsel game.

Well then.....

Wonderful! Now I'll have nightmares tonight!!

But that's Showdown...

Either way, yeah, I pushed Bibi to 500 at level 5. She is pretty good in Brawl Ball, Gem Grab, Heist, even on Siege

If you quack fire when hoodie Leon is close, you hit him automatically.

Honestly at this point just use text.....

Yes that's probably what's gonna happen

Wow same skins and same brawler
---
Aww Man!!
---
I am currently at 6.9k trophies and when ever I use my rank 19 leon I play with people with 8k trophies,10k trophies and 12k trophies.It makes it very difficult to push my power 5 leon to 500 trophies.
---
Wdym by dat

Where is the sound file!?

He stole it from somewhere and claimed it as his own even though it obviously isn't

Piper's expression looks like Darkness from Konosuba

I once got matched with a 0 trophies Piper who used her super to get near the enemy brawlers so she wouldn't fail any shoots...

Nope, they aren't ideas, you can find all these star power in a private server called 'Lwarb Beta'. I have it, so i can start posting 24/7 every third star power of every brawler that has been released so far, but I'm not a karma whore, so i wont do it.

Read the rules then repost it
---
By ‚Äòcrappy art‚Äô I mean the people who draw intentionally bad art for upvotes. There are some maps which are badly designed, but not a lot. For 5 I meant that Frank‚Äôs Twitter and the comment section of other brawl talks are filled with kids asking ‚Äòwhere‚Äôs brawl talk?‚Äô Gedi Kor is still occasionally posted here but not much, don‚Äôt know why I put it there. And by anti teamers I mean the people who post memes of ‚ÄòMortis bad dyna good‚Äô and those other memes with Barley and Dyna. I also forgot about that copypasta, thanks for reminding me about it.

well maybe you should stop being a teaming piece of primo and just git gud
---
Yes, it is. Think of a game like this one without p2w content, where the only thing you can buy with real money are just skins, like happens on Overwatch for example, or R6: Siege. I don't if you know their business model, but it's quite easy: in R6 Siege you can buy with real money only skins and cosmetic stuff and the new operator. In Overwatch you have all the heroes unlocked and that's maybe would be too much for a game like Brawl star, but the R6 Siege model would work very fine in a game like this, and if people only spend money on skins instead of boxes, Supercell could change the game.

Can someone tell me what this meme is called? Please I need to know

Your making this sound like its a massive world breaking problem when its nothing. Not every brawler needs a skin just enjoy the ones you have you spoiled apple
---
Teaming is not a valid start in the first place

IDK how much in brawl stars but in total of all games there are 213 employees but brawl stars has the least amount of employees I think

Lazy upvote.

Using Piper in Showdown modes is definitely overrated

Aight not bad

Guys it's not the trophies that mortis don't have hat
---
Man, I'm just saying in a game like this the skin should be a base content added frequently. I don't know why you bother yourself with the fact that people wants more skin, its normal and I totally agree.
---
18 is maximum
---
I can't believe those people take the time to even start a game if they end up doing this.
---
reminds me of that crash 2 video on yt where every sound is done by someone else,you have my upvote
---
You have way too much spare time my friend
---
Why is he getting downvoted? Are you kids seriously going to stoop so low? It‚Äôs not a must for brawlers to have skins or voices it would just make the game more fun? Firstly you toxic and impatient people should stop spamming supercell for skins and brawl talk it‚Äôs annoying and don‚Äôt downvote people for honest opinion. People get insane numbers of downvoted for saying teaming is a strategy, it‚Äôs true. Everyone complains about teaming but the redditors themselves who complain often contribute to it. Supercell can‚Äôt fix teaming, it‚Äôs only the community who can and a million petitions won‚Äôt work.

Go ahead downvote me I don‚Äôt care

EEEEEL PRIMOOOO!

This is some lukiebear level play! Good job

To be honest I think there are too much dogs but a catgirl is ay worse

I love how the sound cuts as soon as matchmaking's over and it starts loading. So accurate

Dumbass. Barley isn‚Äôt supposed to be anywhere near Rosa. Barley is what‚Äôs known as a thrower. He uses range and walls to take people out without getting hit himself. I was right.

The healing mushroom has been updated to spawn in priority:

 First priority goes to spawning near a player.

Next, it goes to a non teamer.

therefore, it spawns only on a whole group if they are the only people left. And it counteracts the poison.

All his comics are just shitty lol yeah tru comics
---
Only reason he got famous were because of his reply edits
---
Pure talent üëç

tf you say to me you little

Guys I‚Äôm shaking rn someone is knocking on the door and I‚Äôm too afraid. What if he is a robber? What if he bust in? I‚Äôm defenseless rn, what if he frick me up I‚Äôm so scared rn. Frick
---
Nice map
---
Big ooooffff
---
Apparently, it's a small team of people, so monthly updates are already a privilege imo
---
You spelt knuckle wrong twice
---
Just answer the question. Would a Rosa6 survive 2fireballs*2ticls from a Barley10?
---
he.... killed himself?
---
Shelly-2,nita-3,colt-3,bull-3,jessie-2,brock-4,dinamike-3,bo-3,el primo-2,poco-1,barley-4,penny-2,carl -2,darryl-1,rico-2,frank-1,mortis-3,crow-5,spike-2. IDK if crow had 5 skins but the total is 48
---
Quality over quantity. A lot of these skins are mediocre
---
I love bubble gum before bibi kill me with bubble gum....^~^haha(?)
---
Poco = Crow Counter
---
Cool
---
Supercell needs to hire this man rn
---
It's exclusive
---
Perfect team
---
You don't say?
---
That Chase Rowler is just genius
---
Why not
---
Aww she looks so cute
---
GET HIS ASS!
---
Ok $00?
---
r/WhyWereTheyFilming

She's cute

What kind of device are you using?

And mega laser!
---
I had same situation sadly I lost Vs him
---
Noob showcase be like:
---
(The play at the end is good though)
---
Well congrats
---
(The play at the end is the only good part)
---
Oh man and I thought Leon still kept a fast speed with invisiheal but so I guess not.
---
When you call something/someone a term then you are basically calling yourself that. Ted talk
---
Shouldn‚Äôt be possible to do, but was easier than expected.
---
Speed increase is such an OP characteristic for brawlers. I also took Bibi to 500 today. Both were in the low 300s yesterday.
---
Q ramdom
---
Ye lmao
---
It also takes alot of work and money to make the skins and considering how small the team is...we are lucky we even have some skins
---
Congrats
---
They need to be paid to do their work probably.
---
Skin nonetheless
---
So a guy loses once and you think he deserves a ban? Just so you know, posting his private profile with your frustrated rant and encouraging the harassment of this brawler by 3rd parties actually breaches the ToS and you could actually face a real ban. I hope that happens.
---
Ok
---
Do you wanna have a bed time?
---
Okay then.
---
&lt;Grabs a book&gt;
---
Once upon a time ...
---
explains why you nailed El Primo's lines
---
oh rip. I mean no offence, but maybe he wasn't the bad one? Sorry don't kill me
---
Im on Android. My brother plays the game too and we both lag on Retropolis
---
Hahhaaa
---
r/madlad you actually went through and confirmed
---
That's hot
---
It shouldn't cost tickets but it shouldn't give u rewards
---
That's how I think that this would work
---
I don't think you realize what happened.. Seems like your small 9yo brain can't comprehend such complicated thing.. Let me explain. He purposefully didn't play the whole game, he let the other team kill him while he was spinning.. Lemme know if you need me to draw it out for you as well
---
bAN tHOsE tEAmErs
---
I HAVE LEON TOO
---
So what?
---
Soon I Will reach 10000 trophies and I still don't have a legendary
---
This is a failsafe to avoid exploits like the Mortis glitch u were trying. They walk and attack faster I think and they only target the safe.
---
How do you write like that
---
Hoy
---
Yep because some you don‚Äôt see clearly like barleys two star powers because one heals him and the other does extra damage
---
oh look here it's a mobile user! Ah, such a brilliant sight. also it's r/holup
---
Be Thick
---
Can't believe this got so many upvotes.
---
The problem isn't the fucking number of skins. It's good.
---
 But how some brawlers got 5+ while there are a great number with only 1 or none.
---
?WTF?
---
I don't think it says when you become visible to enemies in bushes... You'd need a friend to see it in enemy perspective. :p
---
spike right now
---
Holy heck you are the wonder Brad I am honored you'd respond :)
---
It got alot of upvotes because its true. We have 48 skins and people are to lazy to check so they just upvote because it's relatable. The title is there to trigger the toxic people who complain for more skins
---
I don‚Äôt understand the question. In English please.
---
SHAME
---
This is reposting welcome to redit
---
Niiiiiiiceeeee
---
It's ok. He was bad because he was doing nothing the whole match just standing
---
BUT WE WANT 69!
---
Yep. Saw someone on another sub that had 600 trophies with Leon. I‚Äôm at 9.2k with no legends and mortis now I‚Äôm sad
---
Geez she's sexy af just look at her! (It's supposed to be a compliment to ur awesome work!) 
---
Shelly's next?
---
Well that sucks
---
Congrats! I'm also on my way to being f2p maxed on my main yeet
---
Its leon dude hes not hard to push. Do that with a weak brawler and it will be more impressive plus there is the trophy inflation
---
Yeah, and Leon hasn't even got a voice
---
fire spirits that linger around for a few seconds before they... jump into oblivion?
---
Note:this is not a server its just a map that i downloaded
---
Omg the piper and brocks
---
Are u playing on a computer or is that just me that sees the cursor?
---
no one can play friendly duo cavern churn
---
YET
---
Ok we will just add 56 more skins to brock
---
The problem is when supercell gives us skins it's always for the same few brawlers
---
Don't forget Barley
---
XD awesome idea u have no idea how happy I would be if supercell will actually add this skin to the game LMFAO
---
Then we would have more then 69 skins
---
Just got Leon at 11k, my first
---
You can see him if he just recently walked into a bush to wait about 2 seconds before popping super. Normally, you wouldn't even need to since your enemies get paranoid seeing u walk into a bush with super lol. Flash your super with Leon when walking into bushes to cause more paranoia
---
"So that's why my reply took to long to pop up"
---
Leon is a fucken teamer
---
the question is: how do you join
---
Me want this skin too
---
aren‚Äôt I supposed to have the ‚Äògun‚Äô?
---
Nah you teamed with the healing circle
---
When they released it last September, they said they‚Äôre working on it.

You no get

Poco: #sweats profusely

What model?

Howvmany tickets did you spend?

bruh either you have godly bad luck or supercell literally hates you

also I'm pretty sure that number's not possible. Are you a beta player?
---
Good for you another beautiful lizard!
---
U stole this from the smash clip
---
How many trophies
---
XD lol
---
This reminds me of that one animation when gene pulled the robot to the safe
---
Imagine,the dog shot out bones instead of following you
---
I would have a real boner for that
---
Idk if its too late but you should save for one with more gems unless you have all leggys
---
I just said, im not blaming you, it's one replay. You cant decide from one situation. It's still a nice play

The super ring doesn‚Äôt count, and his shovel has to still be moving when they come in contact. It‚Äôs pretty self-explanatory.

Guys Im shaking. Im fucking shaking. I never wanted to match up with anyone more than I want to with Piper. That perfect, curvy sniper. Those bountiful trickshots. The trophy bearing skills of a literal goddess. It honestly fucking hurts knowing that I'll never match up with her, pass my trophies through her, and have her birth a set of perfect match. I'd do fucking ANYTHING for the chance to get Halloween Mercy match up with me. A N Y T H I N G. And the fact that I can't is quite honestly too much to fucking bear. Why would Supercell create something so perfect? To fucking tantalize us? Fucking laugh in our faces?! Honestly guys, I just fucking can't anymore. Fuck.
---
Who won?

Idk if they downvote. I can't take them seriously anymore with their constant demmand for skins and brawl talks.

 Rico OP

Probably 12 even though reddit is for adults

Both of them dont need a nerf

Everyone will be happy when you hear

Time and money as well. Supercell needs to pay the designers in order for the skins to be available

They are just immature as shit, those kids who still laugh at overused jokes and are inpatient.

 Where is brawl talk, where is brawl talk, why no leon skin, why no skin skin skin.

Remember when people wanted a tarw remodel, skin, and voice? Well she got a remodel and voice but it still wasn't enough apparently.
---
Until a Leon skin, we don't have enough

You are 5000 trophies and make posts like these and complain about not having legendaries? These posts usually say that 5000s get legendaries and people above 10k don't. I am almost 16000 and have 1/3 legendaries, so why don't you shut your hilarious ass up and play the game.
---
ah hell naw
---
Amazing plays
---
I CAN'T CHOOSE! The most broken star power that supercell ever released to the game or a kinda decent star power! WhAt ShOuLd I cHoOsE?
---
Yeah just ignore what I just said.. And I really don't know why you think that reading their ToS makes you look cool or smart because it doesn't, it just makes you a bigger clown
---
what are your plans on adding more progressions for the current system.
---
right now the progression ends once you levwl all brawlers. what are your ideas for late game progression.

the s

addition of multiple star powers were quite nice. anything else?

No worries, lets force soupercall to add custom themes in the game

You will never replicate my success

You spelt expretion wrong

Nice for the comments

Spikes so cute at the ending

And the fact that Piper and Pam need to get remodeled before they get skins

*dies*

Where is Sensei Adam?

Will he be coming back or not?

Mortis be like

this is reddit if they don't agree with u, u will get downvoted to hell

I hope mine get it haha

Ok... *official information* new spike‚Äôs skin Splok

They removed it before release

No necessarily if the mortis quit/dc mid game

i bet most of the people who ask for tara and leon skins will not buy it

Amazing Art

Are you getting married to your PRIMA???

Ok, every brawler i have...

Can you invite me?

Mhm

Well your dumbass came up with 5 somehow so...
---
I meant I will be primo lmao
---
Great art, like I've said before in your other post, why'd you repost this haha
---
3.5k but i had a mythic and a legy before
---
White crow, Phoenix crow, blue mecka, night mecka crow, gold mecka crow  that's 5
---
Darryl: Am I a joke to you?
---
You... you deserve a medal
---
*Drops new skins for Brock, Nita, Colt, Bull and Barley*
---
Supercell: There you have your new skins
---
Ah yes
---
Seriusly nobody comented to say what the think really really
---
It spells out the internal policies regarding what constitutes ban worthy offences, i.e., things your lone event and rant are talking about, i.e., the reason your little temper tantrum caused you to start this misguided post. And yes, ToS reading is sooooo cool. That's what I'm posting for. Cool points.
---
thank you again! no one saw the other post so i tried to repost, but i think no one will see it again ;u;
---
Well i personally don‚Äôt count recolors as different skins but technically white crow is a recolor so ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Why is not the case here because when two players are playing together, if one doesn't want to replay the other one will automatically quit as well, as here the Mortis player has the red X but not the other player

Why ya'll making these vague love scenes instead of meaningfull action adventure scenes?

This is so cool!!!! Hopefully Supercell sees it and make something out of it!!!!

I want is not one brawler 5 skin 
---
I just want every brawler 1 skin
---
It‚Äôs probably people who accidentally bet 1 ticket instead of 20 and don‚Äôt want to wait

That's also me trying to explain noobs that Bull is not the best brawler VS them saying "Lol you don't know a shit, Bull has the best damage in-game lmfaolmfaolmfao I'm so good at the game I have 3000 trophies you suck"
---
Seems like you still don't understand what happened and tbh I'm tired of trying to explain it to someone that's obviously mentally ill and lives in their moms basement reading terms of service of a online game..
---
You really think we would get annoyed by your original stories?! They're fantastic dude! I'm sure I and the community wouldn't mind them. My suggestion of it would be Nita and Bo (tribes), Carl and Mike (mining), Rico (pool bot, replaced Ricochet, the older model), and I would like to see one of Jessie and pan (family).  
---
If you don't wanna do origin stories (you should do them tho), you can resort to making skins, like the swap clothes thing you did, or just drawings of brawlers with each other, like what about a drawing of Bibi playing baseball with bull watching? That'll be cool!
---
No, it's Why have you built the crusty crab. For money(I don't remember how it was said especially I watched it in German)

Guess crow has no skins because all his "skins" are just a recolor of a existing skin that dosen't exist. How do you live normally in this paradox?

Thank you so much I‚Äôm so relieved that people don‚Äôt think that my comics are annoying

Anyway thank you for your suggestions tho it might take a while to make another comic but I‚Äôll try my best

Ban , BAN THEM...
---
At least you have all the Mythics when I have none of them at 12.4k
---
Yeah, What she said!
---
Satisfying
---
48skins in Brawl Star but not a skin for them?
---
TLDR
---
No, I understand. It seems like you're unable to comprehend what actually results is anyone getting banned. But great assumptions! Not childish at all (although I'm assuming you are a child). Mentally ill and living in a mother's basement, all because someone has corrected you? That's a healthy sound deduction there! And I tend to peek at the ToS as they come up in my profession quite a lot.

well, too show you that Brawl stars is better

Thanks! I don‚Äôt make maps often

Lmao you really don't have a life, damn, I feel bad now. Idk what to tell you, go read another ToS or something idk what you antisocial kids do?

What nonsense are you babbling about? Phoenix and mecha crow took actual effort to make

Nah it's very specific it can be useful only against Shelly with Shell Shock, El Primo with his star power, Crow and Frank's super it's super specific so bruh

If a big box is 3 small boxes, shouldn‚Äôt an offer for a small box be at least 10 gems, and likely more to make the mega box deal look like ... well ... a deal

No sps at 600 trophies is pretty stupid

It‚Äôs a copypasta that was posted on some Piper art a while ago. It became a joke to post it on every art post that featured female brawlers. The rest is history

---
Oh, well now I know I'm just arguing with a kid I can ignore you. Your post failed, you embarrassed yourself, and you learnt something about why your pubescent temper tantrums aren't ban listed offences; and why your harassment of the player you posted could result in a ban for yourself (an actual violation of the ToS). I'll leave you to deal with the anger alone now. Life after high-school is going to eat you alive.
---
If it was 10 gems in the shop then what would be the point in removing the big box form the shop? I proposed the value to be 5 gems to make it more appealing for people to buy them. Since it would be so cheap people wouldn't care.  More money for supercell
---
Heroes lol
---
Watermark it in a way that if he steals it you get advertised. Nothing else you can do. It‚Äôs been a problem that has plagued us creatives for eons.

I swear fcking losers why do they do that just go pam or Jessie it's not that difficult

The people who beg for brawl talk and more skins are just toxic. Bad for the community to behave in such a way is very toxic.

I finally found your Reddit account

If it were 5 gems, then there would be no point to the 80 gem mega box.

The amount of luck and coincidence

Guys I‚Äôm sha

That‚Äôs not toxic , if a community wants something then it should be taken into consideration

yeah me too

oh my god this applies to me too

It's not even freaking brawlers, why do I get matched with a freaking lvl 6 Barley?!?! I even was matched with level 10 crow and we easily got 5:50 minutes.

Probably a play with friends and your teammate s friend was noob

nice

Nope
---
Well the mega box would be there for people who don't want to open 10 regular boxes just to get the value of 1 mega. It would be the lazy option and for people that want to max out really fast.
---
The 50 gem token doubler is better then the mega box yet people still buy the mega

Seems like super laggy that's all

And lastly you still haven't said why not playing in a game purposefully is not a bannble thing, so in conclusion you're a huge clown without a life arguing online with kids about stupid things, reading ToS because you have nothing better to do with your life, I truly feel sorry for you and hope you can have a better life and possibly find a wife and get married (doubt it, but still hope for the best for you). I hope we can end this stupid argument here.

---
Now people know that I carried the team
---
Wonder where you got that specific number fromüòè
---
Wtf is this
---
More importantly why does this seem common?
---
The token doubler has an element of time built into it, so that can be cheaper for the same overall rewards. I think if you keep the mega box at 80 gems, the small box would have to be 8 gems at least, or more. If not 10 like the current big box, then maybe 9 gems to push people to getting the mega for 80 gems.
---
Exactly OP doesn‚Äôt even understand that no one is complaining about the amount of skins , they‚Äôre complaining about the number of skins on each brawler , they keep adding skins for brawlers that already have a lot of skins whilst some brawlers have none
---
I played 4 robo rumble matches using 700 trophy bull, and for all for matches I got a shelly teammate. And the shelly teammate all the play the same way as this. I'm 100% sure that this is on purpose.
---
Hey, found the normie
---
Are you a nolife? I assume you‚Äôre not OG cause of  your robo rumble time record... but that level tho....
---
Someone ask if I could post a clearer version of darryl
---
Just shut the fuck up more skins are better
---
You know that this would literally break the game?
---
I am an OG but I never did the trick, my player tag has only 7 characters, and if you made your account about a week after beta release it has 8 characters.
---
I see a 69 in there. Nice
---
If you don‚Äôt ask you won‚Äôt get , they‚Äôre not even spamming
---
Ooh nice 
---
You mean 7 including the #? Mine has 6 excluding it :)
---
The token doubler is 5 gems per box basically. 5 √ó 10 =50 so buying 10 regular boxes would be the same as buying 1 token doubler. No one is talking about the token doubler because 5 gems per box so i don't think people would be mad about regular boxes being 5 gems
---
Yeah you have right bro .post more memes
---
No 7 excluding it, so you must‚Äôve made your account very early but I installed brawl Stars about 3 days after beta release
---
goat legs
---
I'm not really sure how to do that seeing as I am just doing it on Paint
---
And that's a fact
---
thats like comparing a 300 $ phone and a 1000$ phone, im not saying brawl stars is bad , but its dumb to compare two completely different things.
---
Have you seen their social medias?  Specifically the official YouTube channel.

Well played man. Well played
---
Autoaim
---
It will break the game
---
I hear what you are saying but you are neglecting the fact that supercell always prices up rewards that are immediate as opposed to having a time element built into them. 
---
Another example is that for 39 gems, you can get an immediate 220 powerpoints on any brawler (a 440 gold value) or there are deals for 500 gold. The 500 gold is better value for your gems, but only because you have to wait for the offers for powerpoints to come up in the shop to spend that gold (not immediate gratification).
---
You're not the first person to come up with this idea. Supercell already recieved this request a few other times. But thanks for reminding them
---
How about 6 gems per box. You'll be better off buying the token doubler rather then the small boxes
---
What about [this] (https://i.redd.it/o77tb1wq7tf31.jpg)
---
Ok so what do they have to do,  hope that the brawl stars will guess what skins they want or ask for skins they want ?
---
Amazing
---
I dont know if will break the game(2k gems)but i think a lot of youtubers will make a video open the box lol
---
hey fellow bloom popper

I'm sure all the players would like it but it's way too op for them to put in the game

Yeah. More value.

Like once every 3 months. Very rare.
---
Same. Got downvoted to hell for talking about being nonbinary. These are fucking eleven year olds we're dealing with. Masses of them.
---
You are one of them aren't you? You are one of the people who spam their social medias for stupid skins and don't even realise your annoyance. This is most likely why you were confused when I said toxic because you didn't even know that you were causing so much toxicity
---
Haha well I had way to much gold before they released 27 new star powers. It‚Äôs there big plan, release star powers to drain the gold and boxes of OGs. Then they‚Äôre gonna drop a new legendary once everyone is broke and box less so more people will spend real money.

How would you nerf it tho? Last rocket takes longer to reload? Wouldn't change anything really

I just finished a game too, I had bet 10 tickets. We struggled to get past 4 minutes, which is a first for me since even with randoms I always get at least 5:30-6:10 range when I use my lvl 10 Pam. I had got matched with a Bull that died nonstop and a Colt that didn't hit a single bullet and only destroyed walls. Then I looked at their trophies and it all made sense: the Bull was at 500 trophies (5k total) and the Colt was at 180 trophies (300 total), while I'm at 11k. Thank you matchmaking, 10 tickets to the garbage. For the second time today.
---
Everyone who got it at beta definitely got it from someone who played clash royale. I saw from OJ on a clash video.
---
Look, I‚Äôd love em for 5 gems per box, or even less. Who wouldn‚Äôt? 
---
I‚Äôm just staying that if you keep the mega box, and want to realistically price this according to the way Supercell prices in game items, it‚Äôll come out to being 9+ gems per box since it gives immediate gratification but is the cheapest box you can buy in the game, so it‚Äôs gem price per random draw would be the worst.
---
To make it 5 gems, you‚Äôd need to redo all the other offers to make them in line with this pricing scheme. Mega box would have to fall to 49 or less gems, and doubler would need to fall to 25-30 gems.
---
Crow's first star power is pretty good too it helps a lot but people arent regonizing it .It can save you a lot

I don't understand that meme, but ok :/

No I‚Äôm not one of them , I‚Äôve never commented on any of their social media‚Äôs apart from Reddit , nice try trying to just blame me instead of responding to the point I made . Stop using the word toxic in such a cringeworthy and incorrect manner too

That deflation tho. I see now. The 9 gem thing now sounds more believable

80 for tick damm that's amazing. You are now ahead in progression due to this. Maxing out the account is soon to come
---
why not... helps u see if other people are maxed or like if u want to invite a bandaid shelly to your room, u can check if people have the bandaid star power rather than just shell shock

The only scenario for this to happen IMO is that shelly was a team with myke

What did you expect?
---
Another post
---
Honestly had no idea it was brought up. Just got back into playing the game after having a baby. Sorry.
---
Just checked them and yours should be faster than mine, maybe its old?
---
Sorry that the animation wasn't released. The idea just wasn't very good.
---
No.
---
No. It‚Äôs not at all op. Especially given the other stars/supers in the game for tanks. That‚Äôs where it‚Äôs most effective is close range when a tank is on you. But band aid kicks in. Or bull‚Äôs shield activates. Soon primo is gonna run like the wind. Frank stuns you. Rosa hits her super. And incendiary is still better in heist and siege. Rocket 4 seems very balanced to me at this point.
---
I just got it in January, my brother's is like 2 yrs old
---
IT IS NAME IS JO...OOF
---
It is really effective in heist tbh
---
yep i understand because not only is this addition helpful in any way, it‚Äôs also very useful because u can learn more about your enemies at the end of the game. quality post
---
–û, –¥–∞)
---
It 100% doesn't cost more to make the skins than they make from people buying them. And yea it's work. I mean they get paid to make the game as enjoyable for the consumer as possible. That's how the business works.
---
Duos 101....if you can, always wait. But if you can‚Äôt, snag the cubes so the enemy doesn‚Äôt.

Lol no the more level 9 brawlers you have, the lesser the chance of getting the star power for the brawler that you wish to have a star power

A well-played Dynamike is scarier than anything else, change my mind

But you‚Äôve exhausted your tokens, gotten every star token, and have tilted all of your brawlers so you can‚Äôt rank up

Not true. Big Game only lasts for 8 minutes.

That being said, I wonder what's the time limit on Boss fight?

Congrats! Im still waiting for mine lol
---
Is this another dumb complaint about "bad matchmaking?" There is literally NO solution to this!  You're matched up with low trophy people bc they're on a team with their friends.
---
The way matchmaking works, is that it takes the highest trophy brawler on your team, and then matches you with an enemy team that has a similar highest trophy brawler.
---
One solution a lot of people think of is averaging out the trophies of your team. This wouldn't work bc people would exploit it and have high skill friends make mini accounts so they can match up against low trophy players and get easy wins to get on the leaderboards.
---
Another solution is to have an enemy team that also has one low trophy brawler.  Now this is a terrible solution.  Idk why people say this one.  This solution would make matchmaking extremely long.
---
Yes, yes he did

I mean if you buy star powers with gold it costs 54k gold for all the new star powers
---
I hate it when noobs at like 2k trophies say they always have so much gold. That‚Äôs because all your brawlers are new and low level so it obly costs like 50 for you to upgrade and you‚Äôre getting gold faster than you are getting star points. While we high level players get gold at the same rate but we have like 20 brawlers and it costs 800-1250 to upgrade one of them
---
What are your thoughts on my getting a Leon from a brawl box? At &gt;4000 trophies?
---
He actually needs a buff

I think he is at "Some Fly Honeys" house.  Or lurking behind a bingo parlor.

This would give me a reason to grind.

200 tokens, as in the stuff you get for normal brawl boxes.

Because someone else in the game was at 400 trophies. If one person gets the replay, everyone gets the replay.

So I have previous experience making videos for a totally different topic.  I knew how to edit basic videos.  I was in California for a business trip and was sitting in my hotel room bored.  I had been watching a bunch of Chief Pat, NickAtNyte, Molt, CWA and thought..... "I can do that!" So I did.  I played Clash Royale for about 100 videos but never gained any traction because of how YT works.  I had a couple hundred subs when Brawl came out.  I did one video the first day it dropped, really enjoyed it and, as they say, the rest is history.   
---
So Chief Pat, Nick, Molt, Ash were the inspiration.  Boredom was the catalyst.
---
People used to ship her like that, i hate it too, so i pretty much created a brawler (absolutely human and man not woman) that fits her case

I think love finds love.  Love is a mutual acceptance.  No one is perfect.  People change, looks fade, but whats inside counts.  To share your life with somone takes mutual respect and trust.  That's something that's earned. Trust is the heart of all relationships in my opinion.

I was going to, but I had scheduling conflicts with a family trip. Maybe in the future!

Can you add me as your friend I have 11.4k above
---
My id is VISHWAM‚úå
---
well played
---
I'm happy for you!!!  That's really awesome!  Congrats!
---
I mean Poco‚Äôs will strive to get recognition to show the world what they can do and never give up they will see how when he got his first nerf really made him stronger he will show those people what he has been through and strive and grow to be the very best brawler and ever since he got his second star power from my perspective it was all he needed now Poco‚Äôs have a fighting chance to be the best brawler in the game!!!

I have been playing for exactly 242 days (8 months). The total amount of coins I have collected till date is not even a third of those 83,430 coins. I have progressed very quickly in trophies (16k) but am really far behind in terms of upgrades (not a single brawler over power 6). I'm not asking for easily and quickly maxable accounts, I'm just asking for P2W people to stop whining about excess coins after opening thousands of boxes and buying Combo Offers (like the Exp. Level ones)
---
Which band are you in?

it is a star beneath their feet

Uhhh you got me.

nice, thanks for answering! :)

Thanks for the support!  Means a lot.

I think Crow needs a buff.  I recently pushed him to 1008 trophies almost solely in 3v3.  It was not easy.  There are so few maps where crow can play and REALLY excel.  There is almost always a clear better choice. Maybe buff his HP.  Basic but would make him more viable. A more interesting option would be to buff his super regen, but reduce a little of the damage.  Make it so he can jump around more and be a more dynamic playstyle. That's what makes crow fun, so accentuate it!
---
The hat is so heavy he can‚Äôt wear it all night
---
I think he is too lazy for that, but he has considered it.
---
Thanks for commenting but I already do that.
---
Here,a 1 upvote
---
I don't doubt it.  I'm an average player.  Never claimed to be pro.  Plently of people can beat me, but I have fun playing the game!
---
Yes.  When?  IDK.
---
I just hope they don't nerf it. It's the only thing that makes Mortis good in this meta.If they nerf it he will return to his position as the worst brawler in the game.
---
Ah yes. Thank you for explaining what to expect.
---
Saving coins for 2 maxed brawlers ;-;
---
OMG I love your vids gorilla
---
I recently hit 1008 trophies with Crow in 3v3.  There are not many maps where he is a prime choice.  It was a grind.
---
I just got leon but I am at 4.5k trophies. I now have all 3 legendaries tho but no epic or mystic,
---
"Winning siege in 23 seconds" one thing to add in the bucket list
---
It was a spur of the moment thing.  I was talking with Kairos and he mentioned somthing about a pro Mortis interview.  I thought... hmm.. how can I make this funny... and then a few hours later CYDI was born.
---
Nerf the bitch
---
Sorry but hellnah man
---
Big fan
---
Yes!  Those videos are a LOT of work.  Also I don't know who all the actors are though.  Plus they would have to be willing to come on and do the interview.  But it's a goal!
---
It could be better if she does more damage because everyone seems to survive that and her reload speed is really bad
---
Is iT at max or lvl1?
---
13:14???
---
I totally agree!  I know some things I can't share that are somewhat related to that, but let me just say the Brawl Stars team has big plans for the future!
---
ORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORA
---
3 Barleys are going to throw
---
I know that the official API offers more data than the unofficial one, but isn't it still in a beta / non-public phase? (They did a pretty bad job hiding this API)
---
I posted a Minecraft vid a couple weeks ago!  While it didn't get amazing views the people that did watch it seemed to enjoy it!
---
That doesn't make any sense coz it would make progression WAY slower. With only boxes, you get about ~50 power points a day, while you can easily double that figure buy using gold to buy power points from the shop. This essentially doubles the rate at which you can max your account. Also, it it worth to mention that if you have no more power points to collect from boxes you get ~50 gold per box, rather than 20.
---
If anyone‚Äôs in that game has 400 replay it becomes available
---
Yeah, maybe 2 is true but sometimes the teammates exit together
---
Awesome! Thanks for sharing!
---
That‚Äôs coit, not colt.
---
Yeah!
---
How much dedication have you put into brawl stas?
---
He could have a higher attack speed. Like a small cooldown similar to El Primo's
---
What is that suppose to mean
---
Or maybe not many brawlers.
---
What does it take, 860 for power 8?
---
14 small boxes a week + 2 big boxes a week * 3 = 20 boxes a week
---
If each box drops 25 pieces that's a little over 2 weeks per brawler. ( 860^(pieces)/25^(pieces/box) / 20^(boxes/week) )
---
Drop the average to 12 since my last 2 boxes were 6+8 and 5+5 that and it's 5 weeks.
---
Thank you!!!
---
Meant my first, my apologies could have titled it as so.
---
 Do you want in-game event on Brawl Stars birthday?
---
What is the funny part
---
yea, im a brawl stars GOD üòéüòéüòé
---
Do you wish for a return of the OG Mortis?
---
Let‚Äôs hope itsh for Rico. Or else u/coachflapjack  isn‚Äôt going to like this.
---
I need those brawlers too... but I have 6100 ish trophies.... I‚Äôm sorry
---
We need this:(
---
ha no hat morris dies
---
top hat morris wins
---
The odds of what???
---
ghi\
---
Because who needs a siege robot
---
When Piper tries to super away from any brawler faster than Nita's bear
---
I know still pretty funny
---
I am F2P and started August 2017 I got 30k gold when they introduced the double reward with the adds
---
Could you at least think of something better other than the overused 420 joke?
---
Yeap
---
Ash was caught teaming many times even though he was an anti teamer. How do you feel about this?
---
When you choose normal you can choose solo or duo
---
Ablahahaha
---
That says 2nd
---
Yeah so doing this it will benefit him and his teammates
---
Nice win though!
---
Buy them, but save them for when big game is back
---
Sorry  see a ting I made it‚Äôs loading
---
Thank you, yes that was my joke üßê
---
I honestly don't remember any of their names other than Frank, because his parents named him after the Brawler and I think that's just wonderful
---
·¥Ö·¥ú·¥Ö·¥á ·¥ú ·¥Ä·¥ò·¥á·¥Ä Ä·¥á·¥Ö …™…¥ ·¥Ñ·¥è·¥Ä·¥Ñ ú ·¥Ñ·¥è Ä è's ·¥ç·¥á·¥ç·¥á  Ä·¥á·¥†…™·¥á·¥° ·¥Ä…¥·¥Ö …¢·¥è·¥õ 10/10!
---
I'm speaking of Supercell devs young lad, but I agree Bull is a major Bull
---
It already does
---
A lvl 6 does 1600 damage, that is more than a lvl 6 Frank, you can 4 shot most brawlers in the game with ease
---
Stai ce??!
---
Poco 700 trofee
---
Poco without his super is garbage
---
What‚Äôs in your opinion the hardest brawler to push?
---
Not really i mean... Just run like the arrows arenpretty slow tbh
---
I mean technically p2w is right. You have odds in your favour if you pay to bolster those odds. Unless you are paying to simply buy cosmetics in which case it‚Äôs still not p2p it‚Äôs.. pay 2 swag?
---
It looks and sounds like a very good idea.
---
Wow i thouth that me at 4.3k with only 4 rare and 3 srare (i got carl 2 days ago) is bad...
---
Congrats mate
---
ur idea sounds good
---
Exactly, also bull dealing over 20% of the IKE life with a single ult is ridiculous.
---
Whatever it is I hope it's different. Piper is my favorite character to play, but her design is not that exciting
---
Why does this post exist
---
What‚Äôs wrong with being me?
---
So? I didnt say i did that in 1 go.
---
I have enough tomatoes for a farm
---
I plan to buy GENE
---
My last mythic
---
top
---
Lmao i always listen to spotify or soundcloud while playing but it would be awk to have a spotify song on in a clip
---
Dude your supposed to have 420 for the memes
---
what the fuck did you just bringed upon this cursed lands
---
Shelly Windows :v
---
Same.
---
I'm dumb I was looking at the names to find the joke I should've read the comments first
---
ONEPUNCHBOT XDXDXDXDXDXD
---
Shelly Wins :v
---
I don't think u get the point... Q
---
It may genuinely be a good meme but not good enough for that
---
I played with u guys last time and u guys didn't git even half percentage on our ike, lol
---
r/madlads
---
I spend my money however I want. :)
---
My favorite brawler is spike.I love his design and I love his versatility.r/spikegang
---
sure you built that or just copied and pasted it.
---
aw man
---
Any advice on using Crow?
---
I want to get him to Rank 20 before season ends
---
Missed out on meme potential. I'd be rolling on the floor in laughter if I just hear the Benny Hill theme playing on blast as you charge the IKE turret.
---
I'm thinking of the engineer from btd battles. He has an ability called overcook and build turrets to attack which is pretty similar.
---
Hopefully they take away siege and gem grab they just aren't fun
---
How long u playin?
---
Dont even imagine,the pain is obsolete
---
Band-Aid will be nerfed
---
Not if you pick a mortis and piper apparently
---
:)))) cringe
---
Also I want none of you to be a major asshole by reporting him with the intent to get him banned because of the username. Still want him to continue making others like me laugh their asses off throughout the match.
---
Imagine Tara takes off the face wraps and she's a guy. Oof
---
Which is ur favorite brawler
---
That's illegal
---
W h a t ?
---
The rico one is sooo true
---
I like it
---
Wait, who‚Äôs the third one?
---
Yea :|
---
They should use u/Develop_Art‚Äôs version
---
you sound like someone id have to tell theyre shit
---
Ultimate objective of the mode is to destroy the IKE 
---
Siege bot is there just to help you but if u don't collect bolt you probably will lose
---
Siege is in its best state **IMO** (unless you can't tell its MY OPINION)
---
They should use u/Develop_Art‚Äôs [version]
---

---
I‚Äôm just spreading this on all posts I see, not just you...
---
Fun fact:Carl doesn't have footsprints
---
I still get triggered when ppl say with wrong terminology lol
---
I had never had any problems memorizing terms idk whats so hard
---
Is it possible you can be an even better YouTuber than you already are?
---
how about just making it for all counts instead tho
---
Time to use screeching solo.
---
Acctually yea he was playing with crow, but crow is at 6k trophies which doesn't change it
---
Just because her starpower is op doesn‚Äôt mean you can just ignore it and hope for the best.
---
You can see the star, you know that‚Äôs she‚Äôs going to heal, don‚Äôt get that close to her. 
---
bandaid sucks but this wasn‚Äôt a big brain move of you, as you could‚Äôve killed her or atleast gotten away alive.
---
Bull and Shelly aren‚Äôt nearly as good as Rico, Barley, Dyna, Tick, or Carl.
---
wait so mortis is indeed trans or
---
So? You only get 6-10 gems a day in CoC yet they constantly have challenges that give 100+ gems.
---
10 gems is fine
---
Are 2 characters in a single box even possible?
---
thanks for perfectly phrasing what i wanted to say.

No, I know that but if I were in the situation of those opponents, I would easily been able to predict where he was going.

Not scared there's no band aid shelly or bull.

Shame on that bush camping bull
---
wait until you see Golden Wind season and Stardust Crusaders animated

Anything in the game files for screeching solo? Or anything else?

When people say this I always assume they mean both the stats and the character, but I wonder who sees the credit on the bottom right lol.

quit complaining and actually learn the matchmaking system

Did it go well?
---
nobody cares about these small minute details.
---
What brawler shall I do next?
---
Prop hunt????
---
Little do you know Leon is in the picture

this is another post where these are just small minute details that no-one really cares about. Also your photo-shopping skills are trash you dumb bitch and you should be ashamed of your-self.
