You shouldnt be able to go below the rank below your brawler (example:a rank 10 cannot enter the trophy zone of rank 8$

What you have to understand is that this game is marketed towards kids... you can see the same effect on the fortnite sub, which indicates to me that 10 year olds don't really make great conversation on reddit.
---
I‚Äôm good with him I‚Äôve got him top 200 back in the old days and I don‚Äôt play him because of how bad he is. It‚Äôs a brawler they could do a total remake of. 
---
Poke the enemies to charge your super and when they group up, super them and all of them would probably die.
---
Sorry, I forgot to mention something.
---
The daily free item in the shop should be removed and replaced with this.
---
However this is a idea! It can be scrapped, tweaked, reworked, etc.!
---
I don't feel like Supercell should just give out free Mega Boxes everyday, this game is very F2P compared to other Supercell games.
---
Any feedback I get is appreciated very much.

Sorry for not making this commit earlier!

This is exactly what I was thinking.

Sorry dude life isn‚Äôt fair. The legendary brawlers aren‚Äôt even that OP. The only one I‚Äôd say is ridiculously OP is leon but pretty much only in showdown. In other game modes you can use multiple players to take care of him. Spike is really good but manageable. Also you‚Äôre complaint is that they are really good and really rare, that‚Äôs really contradictory bc of course the best brawlers will be the hardest to get I mean what do you expect. If you don‚Äôt like the game you don‚Äôt have to play it. 
---
I love your art style!!

150 gems is so expensive :(

He could've been playing before the December update. Back then there was a conversion of tokens or some other currency to gems.

True. True.
---
if you mean OG, then no lol

but I didnt like the tap to aim feature when I first got the game
---
I‚Äôm not gonna 1v1 you over a conversation about why people leave the game instead of pressing play again, in a game that doesn‚Äôt even have a proper 1v1 game mode. What is this, Fortnite? Call of Duty? Get over yourself.

Ahem it‚Äôs a canary.

We need this

I forgot to mention that the daily gift item should be removed for this system.

Hi.

I had a friend who had recently contacted Supercell Support about the topic of offers. Their response said that offers appear "at random." Also there are indeed Legendary offers, but they are not as likely (that's what I'm understanding at least).
---

I didn't get that opinion by myself, I've seen guides and tier list in videos explaining who is good and bad.

If you don't like my opinion then please either give more than one good reason why you disagree

I like this map a lot but endgame offers no long range/low damage brawlers a chance. Maybe break up the bush and put more open spaces and walls in the middle. In the rooms or ‚Äúbuildings‚Äù I would even put some more stuff or decorations in.

Sorry man I got crow when I was at 2500. I pray for all the RNG unfortunate people

Ir got removed, no explanations. I mean, it was a worst Skull Creek after all

I think adding a twist to the brawler would be pretty near. I think a robot construction worker would be pretty good. We need more robots like Rico, barley, and Darryl.
---
get ready for toxic breading grounds, propulation: bulls and leons 
---
There used to be character lore since day 1, but it got removed on December 5th... I don't think Supercell knows that the attack info buttons exist.

Can you post your leggy's percentage?

---
In a game called AoV, the creators added a monthly login for coins, gems, etc. They would also add skin tokens to get a skin if you login every day for a month. If you missed one, it would be fine because you could pay 200 gold to get the reward or something. It would be cool if it was something like this. 
---
Have you brought up that issue previously? That's what they might mean, that they already addressed this issue with you.

They also cannot move, but they can still shoot. Pulling close ranged enemies away like primo and bull can be game winning. Also, yes she is in no way a close range brawler as some people think. I made sure to stress this a lot. She has damage to burst down low-medium health enemies but she does not have the health to survive.

If I have 7ping out of curiosity what kind of ping are you getting?

Yes yes i like that.

IF YOU ARE GOING TO INCLUDE AN IMAGE FOR A BRAWLER, MAKE IT ORIGINAL!!!! DONT COPY PASTE!!!!!
---
If they could tell how many gems have been picked up, I‚Äôm sure they could tell when accounts have been created. Also the player tags could indicate when a player first started, with a certain sequence being the dividing point between OBs and Newbies. Why I think this is, is that some of the very first accounts created had very short tags and I‚Äôm willing to bet they follow an order that can be tracked.
---
Thanks for the suggestion
---
Equating cancer to teaming, stay classy 
---
Hahaha 
---
Very nice! What part took the longest?
---
I believe that would be how it works, and the reward would progressively get better the more days in a row you logged in.
---
Well, yeah, every person have different levels. But if you really wanna know....
---
20 \* lvl
---
Lets say that you are a lvl 100
---
(20 \* 100) / 100 = 2000 / 100 = 20 Boxes from experience rewards with a lvl 100.
---
That is a great idea, never thought of that.
---
Can YOU get a nerf? Geez, 11k missing 3 brawlers? Damn

[removed]
---
Can you stop being such a douchebag

The team already said many times they won't implement this because then people would start chasing stats and not playing to win. (Sometimes sacrificing yourself may be the best play but you might not feel like doing that if it'll be recorded in a statistic).

I'm like that too lol :')

I have a print of that somewhere. When that happened, i was like "Wow, so that happened"

It was pretty cool tho. Happened only once.

Idk, let me check my tag, I made account on second day of beta release

Also, why are people downvoting :(

i personally would prefer a health buff

It looks like Magneto

Add some walls around the lakes, then it should be 10/10

Damage and health buff

So this whole time, we've only seen one of her eyes and that's in her character profile picture?

What about brawlers that can walk on water, or have a super that allows for multi jumping walls and objects.

r/accidentalswastika would disagree

You Lose! *elprimo voice*

He gave him $5,000 when he died

Does it count big boxes like three or just one?

So when is the season over? Sorry for asking, I literally don‚Äôt know. Thanks.

yea, demise is proof u dont need skill for trophies, but a 13k knows whats good and whats bad, theyre not gonna use piper on cavern churn

If you are on mobile click on the three dots on the corner of the subreddit. Idk about pc but it shouldnt be much different

13K not gonna play sdüëÄ

u said he was the worst brawler, i agree with completely reworking him especially his star power but hes def the easiest brawler in the game 2 push trophies with

Why didn't they just flank You?

Spicy mikey
---
MY CULTURE IS NOT YOUR **** BRAWL STARS SKIN!!
---
Personally, I think Darryl players are the #1 players in the game, and deserve free mega boxes (completely biased)
---
It‚Äôs too bad I play brawl stars on the opposite orientation haha
---
Yeah, that's fair. Maybe instead of replacing the slot, they should add another one so we don't get Heist/Bounty/Brawl Ball so inconsistently.
---
Oof lol 
---
Every time you open brawl boxes and don‚Äôt get a brawler, your chance increases. If you get a new brawler, for example a mythic, chances of a mythic goes down. If you have all the brawlers of the same rarity, the chances of other rarities increases. 
---
.15 is good for a legendary by the way.
---
**Friendly Battle / Ranked Battle Posting to Club**. This is posting matches to your club so that it gives you an actual reason to be in a club. This way you could organize friendly matches without inviting every single person. Same goes for ranked matches, it would be fun to have that as an option. A similar thing is done in Clash Royale.
---
**Club Enhancements**. This is a major thing that needs to change. The clubs in this game almost seem pointless. If they added a donation system, wars or even challenges much like Clash of Clans, the game would have more of a purpose and so would clubs. This is very important to the longevity of the game.
---
Love both those ideas

My chance was .1104, until I unlocked crow.

if ur on mobile go to the subreddits main page and push the 3 dots in the upper right hand corner and it should say choose flair or something? i only know how to do it on mobile sorry, but it should be around the same way to do it on computer i‚Äôm assuming (i also agree mortis players are #1)

Don‚Äôt we all.üòÇüòÇ

My left ear is about to explode.

Wow... -.-

Well I‚Äôd just say enjoy not seeing teaming while you can. I miss those days.
---
&gt;Looks all right but it would be dominated by teaming throwers
---
FTFY
---
Super buff definitely. His damage isn‚Äôt supposed to be good. His job as a brawler is to poke and slowly whittle down opponents and then assassinate them with his super which is sh*t right now. 
---
I liek jessie (did I do this right?
---
Lol this post itself is shit too
---
This is so sad, can we play Mortis in showdown?
---
&gt;Barley maxed stays alive 30% more time, enough time to he make to #5 or higher

Or just walk up and shoot him lol. Darryl was bad. GJ though. I hate teamers.
---
Teach me backstabbing senpai

It's not a completely bad idea, maybe switch to you get a disadvantage for not moving a few tiles every 5 seconds. Like losing health or damage and it could stack up to 5 to lessen the amount of campers.

That‚Äôs mbps mine is faster, what‚Äôs ping tho? Also think I may have figured something, when my üñ• is on and I‚Äôm playing while I‚Äôm watching something then it seems to slow down a bit

Not OP. Just very good if you are skilled. Similar to mortis and primo or even frank/shelly who have tricks in BB. Kick slam and kick freeze for example are very powerful but very hard to master.

I pushed mine to 500 in solo SD. Get boxes, get ult. Hide in Bush behind wall and wait for prey. Kill and repeat.

Throwers in teams of 5 XD

What am I supposed to be seeing here? Is this just you spectating a match? Where is your Brawler?

Mortis is definitely more Renekton with Vlad's skin on.

I always thought his saying "troop ready for pain"

I feel sorry for that Penny

i had an epiphany

I really like the three boxes cutting off the two sides of the spawn, this could really help on the ‚Äúsit behind goal‚Äù problem alongside the big entry you made, good job

Thats pretty damn high actaully youll probably get it soon mines

What dies that mean

Hope so
---
How long gave you been playing?
---
Your first idea is great. To be honest, they need to give Clubs it‚Äôs own button and user interface. Having club info and the club chat seperate is a horrible design choice. Club chat needs to be bigger for this idea to look good.
---
Second idea is bad. Why? Brawl Stars is not as P2W as other Supercell games. With donation you could easily use your mini accounts to give your main account power ups. Another downside is that after we have max PowerPoints we cannot get more PowerPoints, if we just get excess PowerPoints then Supercell loses money by giving us extra ways to gain rewards from donating and receive PowerPoints faster

And as for teaming, most are probably from newer players

but that's just a theory. A GAME THEORY! Thanks for watching.

It's a lot more graphically intensive than clash royale and clash of clans so I don't think it's too surprising that some people will encounter dropped frames

---
Yeah that's why I said remodel/skin concept
---
Because everyone's asking for a remodel because he's ugly as all hell right now
---
Well coins and power points are actually 94% because in some boxes you might get only a brawler and that means no coins and power points, so the rest 6% is brawler only chance.
---
Thats like a hot maze
---
I would guess that the rule of 99 means that if you have 100 players in your club, the lowest gets kicked, bringing your club to 99 players. A lot of clubs do it.
---
Should be okay now: file is un-protected and can be copied &amp; zoom

So u r the reason no one wants to team with me when i play crow :')

Actually dynamike's shots are harder to dodge then barley's since they're faster and his super is almost impossible to dodge too. Why would you need to controle territory if you can just kill all of them?

Hey guys, Peter Griffin from the hit show Family Guy!

This joke gave me a hearty laugh after realizing what it‚Äôs meaning was. You see the joke is about a quality in pixels with examples being 480p 720p 1080p and 4K. This example has the lower quality from lower to higher. The joke is representing crow in the first photo likely as a cartoon and an actual crow in real life. This represents that the real life crow is higher quality than the in game crow! You got it now?

You can maybe diversify the games, your content look a lot like what the channel Albino would do, you could take example and improve it with your personality on it.

Well they just had a global release and I‚Äôm sure that and polishing the game took up all their time and now their focusing a lot on new things.

I think Brawl Star team is different from other team, they will tell us and surprise us when the update is around the corner and ready in few days....
---
So expect they drop in update summary when it is ready to release the update....
---
This is sick!

Really, this kind of posts are much better than all the memes posted recently

You are a hero to us all

I don't remember what was the value of his old speed. Has it the same as tanks? Because if yes, i'm totaly ok with it.

I'm sure they'd shit their pants if you moved towards them and start attacking like a mad man! :D

Yeah I noticed that behavior. But actually this doesn't seem to work. Everybody is annoyed because of that.

I wish I had your editing skills bro, really well done, had a good laugh!

Nah, the rewards are just ridiculous. Also, instead of joining when you are 500 trophies, you should be able to join when you reach a specific level (Lvl 50 or lvl 25 for example). The rewards should only be Gold and Power Points. Or maybe a "Tournament Box" that may include gems, but depends on your luck, because if Supercell is gonna give everyone 2000 gems (Like 70$ - 100$) to random people then the game will no longer will be fun, and there will be no reason for buying gems. 
---
If your mortis doesn‚Äôt wear a hat he‚Äôs not a mortis.
---
He didn't exactly said that it was going to he in it primer state. Maybe a new solution, like, the ball cannot go where you spawn? I like to spawn behind the goal, but players keeping the ball there is very bad.
---
Piper getting piped! 
---
I think that game was infested
---
No, having kda will only make most players even more obsessed with kills and bein "the mvp"
---
O agree withe the reload buff but his speed stays. Dont worry tho,bull can counter him.
---
Why'd u etch out the names? Also it's based on brawler trophies and character trophies kind of
---
Ok. This is epic!
---
Lol hi
---
Play bull that‚Äôs what 
---
Therefore, Supercell will no longer make money and probably won't do more updates due to the game not making enough money to maintain the servers, pay help and support, etc...

Ads were optional and you got to double a single reward from a box, but later on it multiplied every reward by 1.5.
---
Same with crow lmao
---
White Crow exists apparently.
---
I agree.......i want it removed as well....but currently the way this game runs....(ie left stick to move right stick to fire)....if u take away auto-aim....all shotgun brawlers will face difficulty firing
---
"Conical aim" type brawlers cant aim at such low range......
---
Omg same. i trynna find Barleys and Dynas in hot maze and Couldn't find any üò≠
---
Or he could keep his speed (which is what makes him a unique brawler) and they could rework brawl ball by making it so you take up an ammo slot to shoot the ball. 
---
I am mostly offended by the word ‚Äúroyal‚Äù but I do not think this game needs more kinds of reward systems. It‚Äôs just hard to get a Mega Box. That‚Äôs it

First of all thank you for such a nice post very good one , all I wanted to say is that don't get your hopes up they will eventually release balance changes more frequently but NEVER updates they've been doing this for over an year updates every 3 months and if you're lucky 2 new brawler every 6 months , and it's not because they're not capable it's just because they don't want to work , they work a very few time compare to other gaming companies and still fan boys try to protect them , now I'll tel u what's not an excuse for frequently update:
---
1) small team: the team is small true but they could easily wok faster or more the problem is only that they don't want to 
---
2) "I pReFeR a LesS UpDatEd gAme Than OnE fUlL o BugS": completely untrue I play other games like db legends which has a small team too since 90% of mobile games team are pretty small but dragonball legends get update WEEKLY with new story/event/mission ecc
---
3) " It WoUld Be HaRD To BaLNce too Much bRAwLERS" : also untrue since as I said before other games that i play release 4/6 characters per month and they are very balanced in pvp
---
Now there are no excuses they're very slow and have very light job roasters that's it there is nothing else to say  but it's useless stupid people will always defend them no matter what even if they don't update the game for 4 year not everyone is strong enough to accept the truth and the reality. Anyway a MOBA game like this needs ABSOLUTELY missions with good rewards not like clash royal something like a skin or gems etc but very updated mission , weekly/daily  missions, this game is 90% only for hardcore players cause you can play only for trophies and ranked and in a moba it's a suicide a game beautiful like this will die and be forgotten in 1-2 years like clash royale that now days  it's played almost only by hardcore and veterans player, this game needs weekly or at least monthly updates with more stuff to do in game FOR EVERYONE , casual matches , skins, brawlers, missions, daily reward , and tons of other stuff like other games . Oh and before the usual fan boy answers like : "the game has just come out" no it's not the game has been in development for over a year and they added only 5/6 brawlers and changed the ui/3d models in 1 fuc\*\*\* year do u get that ? that's why I lost hope for the game I bet what u want that we will have balace changes but never constant and monthly updates again they just don't work 8 hours a day like normal people . I know coding is hard but trust me a new brawler or skin or map doesn't need 3 months that's all I had to say
---
Oh shit üòÇ
---
Hey Frank, have we considered solutions like the ball cant be behind the imaginary line where the ball goes in the net for more than 10-15 seconds before it resets to the middle? Or maybe you can‚Äôt pick the ball up while you‚Äôre invisible. Thanks.
---
That's what he said

You are the biggest... 
---
436 cups and you got a crow. 5500 cups and I haven't got any legendary brawler in 6 months I'm playing.
---
But really, what are the odds that they team up?
---
I'm 100% sure because your trophies, if it was at least 420, you will find many dyna and barlys.
---
but how to get dinamike befor 2k?
---
Cool
---
Good luck
---
Yeah Frank, not fun to play at all anymore. Consider a reset of the ball to the middle after being behind the goal line(imaginary line across where ball is considered a goal) for say 10 seconds

---
Great idea Bro!
---
Ooooooohh
---
This is  a small guide on how to play him:
---
First of all, Darryl is _not_ a tank, he is an assasin. His description is a bit misleading.
---
His super can be used to:
---
1) Rolling away. On maps like Thousand Lakes, use the water to extend the roll.
---
2) Attacking. NEVER ATTACK A TANK WITH DARRYL. Thats important. Use the roll to roll towards ranged brawlers (Piper, Jessie, Penny, Frank, Brock sometimes, Colt and Rico (be careful), Bo, Nita, Barley (if super is not charged), Dynamike, Crow and Poco). 
---
Avoid rolling towards enemies with supers charged. Piper, Tara, Nita, Jessie, Crow, Spike and Barley are very dangerous if they have their supers ready.
---
If you roll towards a spawner (Jessie, Penny, Nita), be  careful. Their turrets/bear can cause serious problems, since Darryls hp and dmg aren't good enough to handle two opponents.
---
Remember to aim correctly your super, it's important to get as close as possible to your enemy. If you don't roll right on top of the enemy, you won't deal that much damage, and Barley, Jessie, Penny or Crow e.t.c. may get enough time to charge their supers. If you miss your roll, retreat immediately if there is cover nearby. If not, retreat and hope that they choose to fall back and heal, or keep attacking until your super is charged (this is a bit risky, only do this if you are close enough).
---
I suggest to hide in a bush, since many ranged brawlers come close enough, even when they check the bush, since many don't expect someone to kill them at such a long range.
---
Against tanks Darryl is weak. He can outrange Bull and Primo, and he has the same speed as they have, so you can follow them and deal chip damage at safe distance. Roll away if they suddenly change direction and try to attack. 
---
Spike is easy to kill, as he is so squishy. His super can cause some major trouble!
---
Pam is  a tricky one. She deals great damage and outranges Darryl. I suggest not to attack Pam alone as Darryl. 
---
Frank is easy prey. You can roll close to him and attack. If he tries to super, roll on him. The knockback of Darryls super resets Franks super. Remember, always approach Frank by rolling. If you walk towards him, he can kill you in a couple of shots before you can even touch him. Recharge your super as quickly as possible on him, since you may need it if he tries to super.
---
Ricochet and Colt can be killed easily due to their small hp. But if they are skilled enough, they may kill you with their super while you roll.
---
Brock can be easy to kill, but since Darryl has so little health and Brock does so much damage, it's best to trick him to use his rockets and then roll.
---
Dynamike and Barley are easy to kill, but Barleys super can be lethal if he has time to throw the bottles. Kill him fast!
---
Leon rekts Darryl, as he deals great damage and outranges him. 
---
Darryl can 1v1 Tara, but be careful.
---
Stay away from Crow if your super is not charged. Healing is important for Darryl, and Crows poison can cause major trouble. Never roll against a Crow with hes super ready. If you miss your super, Crow may have time to run away and keep you in poison.
---
Shelly is the ultimate counter to Darryl. She outranges Darryl, and deals too much damage. Never attack Shelly as Darryl.
---
Bo can kill you if his on a high level. You may still be able to kill him. Roll right on top of him.
---
Never roll towards Mortis, he just swipes away and you wasted your super.
---
If your enemy is near death, and you are too, I don't recommend using his super as the final shot that kills the enemy, like you can do with Bull, since Darryls supers damage can easily be overestimated, and you end up rolling away, and the enemy gets an opportunity to escape. Never do this against tanks.
---
Without his super, Darryl is extremely vulnerable. Stay in bushes and do not fight until hes super is charged.
---
Never roll against an enemy without full ammo and health!
---
Play Darryl on the right maps. Open maps, like Thousand Lakes, are good, since he can roll everywhere and use the lakes to extend his super. Maps like Rockwall Brawl are bad, since throwers behind walls are lethal if you play Darryl. Also, there aren't many bushes where you can wait for prey. 
---
Darryl is good in SD, since hes a good camper. As hes super charges automatically, you don't have to attack to charge it, unlike Bull. Hes also good in Brawl Ball, since he can use the knockback of his super to take away the ball from enemies. His super can be used as Mortis attack, throw the ball and roll after it. Hes super is also good in Brawl Ball as it charges so fast.
---
Hide behind boxes in SD, and let the enemy destroy the box. Grab the power cube and super away or towards them!
---
Play him as a flank. Sneak up to the enemy spawn, and roll on them when they are low hp and retreat to the spawn. Then, roll away before they respawn.
---
In Heist he is good at maps like Safe Zone, G. G. Corral and Cactus Corridor, where he can roll over the water. His dps is also high enough to deal significant damage to the safe. When you have attacked the safe and enemies start to respawn, roll away and hide in the bushes near the safe. When the enemies come and attack you, roll back to the safe and attack it. This way, the enemies will try to kill you and forget to attack your safe, and your teammates have time to come and help you.
---
He is best on higher levels, he is too weak on power level 1-4. 
---
His star power helps him a lot, since he can survive more shots.
---
I hope that helped you!
---
No it means dodging
---
That sounds like something from Overwatch or Pixel Gun 3D, which seems kind of unoriginal but could see this become a thing but if it is 5v5 
---
I made a post like this a while back and it got on the front page lol

---
Better version... Did you get big box with randoms? Yes. What did it cost? Everything. 
---
Please, don't "main" a brawler, you will ruin matchmaking for you and for us
---
Bo is right now one of the worst brawlers in the game, at high trophies they only thing he is useful for is his star power, without star power he is bad
---
He seems like he is strong because you are at low trophies
---
Also, Bo is getting voice acting next update! And probably a remodel
---
Everything is good here but the fact that you got Tara, Spike and Leon(i do have it but not others like you) makes me feel sad.
---
So that he he will not win with that...
---
It's Magic ^^^/s
---
whether you get a big box with randoms or with a team, outcome won‚Äôt change based off how u got it, so no, not better version. Losing trophies with randoms is a prob everyone has experienced
---
Why did they remove portrait mode?
---
Idea: Add Locked Movement Joystick in options
---
Wait a second...
---
LOL, I know ~ this happened to me many times before LOL
---
It‚Äôs sometimes green to show that it is you if it‚Äôs white some people will get confused who is who
---
Love this map but maybe a bit less walls. Overall I want it in game.
---
Finally Leon got bullied
---
Preach lol
---
need more modification
---
Just shoot at enemies til you get your super, then use yor super to pull the enemy gem carrier and kill him 
---
I don't like teaming either, but i think in a way backstabbing is worse, since they trust you
---
Nice, i'll try
---

I WOULD LOVE TO SEE SHELLY‚ÄôS CHICKEN FINISHED!

I really don't see your problem with it... You need everything. Someone who is further in the game needs it. But you???
---
All of them. You should level up all of them to lvl 6 or 7, because you have to play with all of them
---
Then, I would suggest you to upgrade to 8 and above the ones you like more and the ones their star power is almost necesary
---
r/foundthemobileuser

And in fairness I'm pretty sure the character models in db legends are taken straight out of dragon ball games on the PS4. Brawl Stars has to make up new caracters and model them from scratch

I mean, it is possible, but he isn't a good brawler overall. He needs a buff, and at the same time a nerf for his star power

Wow! Here, before it blows up.

I've only ever team when i see this like when he tried to do with Tara but they never want to

Since potrait and I'm 10k+, territory controlling of the whole game would guarantee a win but a few kills won't as they are not trapped and can still respawn and kill u.

I can dig it

With mortis?

I actually like it because all the campers and bulls will just play the bush lines and if you don't want to deal with that shit and actually play with skill you can go around in the open areas. Noobs play other noobs, everyone is happy.

üëÄ I‚Äôll take 2 then

Man I was wondering you would be cool with me using this idea in a sketch for the contest, I was gonna make like a school dance seen and that looks like an outfit Leon would be wearing to me, I don‚Äôt think I need to ask technically but just wanted to ask
---
üëÄ
---
No.
---
The fact is, if theyre dead you have the territory anyways. When if youre just "controling territory" theyre are still alive and they'll come back right after to kill you. Also, it depends in wich mode youre playing on. If youre in bounty then yes, kills is what matters the most.
---
Never under-estimate Crow.

Then walk to your teammates and shoot him.

Don‚Äôt walk too close to your teammates though he will dash through both of you and spam super

Barley is actually the best brawler in the game. (Uses super to annihilate 2 brawlers mid fight) *A little strong?*

is there also a consolation prize?

Colt range
---
Crow movement speed
---
One of the best brawlers cqc
---
And his ult makes him invisible, meaning that you need to shoot everywhere to be safe.
---
Not sure how that's not broken, there are a lot of people who already have him at +400 at lvl 2
---
What is considered as low level? I got 16/22 brawlers and except of two all are at Power5 or higher 
---
It's normal
---
Here's what I got so far

What?
---
I want chicken
---
That just sounds like a worse brock
---
It‚Äôs froze
---
Chill out bro. He‚Äôs relatively balanced. Just bc u rnt doninating w him doesnt means hes ‚Äúabysmal‚Äù and ‚Äúincredibly weak‚Äù. He is great control brawler who is the reining King of Chip Damage. Maybe needs a very slight buff to his health. 
---
They weren‚Äôt teaming they attacked theirselves
---
Yeah it's annoying that happens because one person has 0-50 more/less trophies it ignores the other 2 brawlers
---
There is a subreddit for finding clubs r/brawlrecruit
---
Right, I don't think it adds any competitive edge over touch screen controls. But if your touch screen is wonky it WOULD solve the problem. 
---
Hope this gets more up votes so it can be implemented 
---
El primo and leon

(‡≤°œâ‡≤°) 
---
XD
---
Why did you  have to show me this
---
Its totally worth it getting powerpoints from shop to get lvl 9 real quick. Reason behind is you can get star power and once you get powerpoints for tara you get 2gold each instead
---
Wa, not va. Gameplay may work as well, though I'm not totally sure
---
There's literally nothing wrong with the third picture, the brawlers with the least and most (Penny &amp; Poco) trophies are still in a decent skill range
---
r/brawlrecruit
---
That may just be you.
---
I think you can see by the worth/ grammar mistakes that op is very young so dont be too harsh
---
well, i logged in today and it was full with darryls soo ü§î
---
I'm confused, is this a self-promotion?
---
aye worked we have our 1st date  today at 7:00 we going to chuck e. cheese &lt;3
---
We finna gonna play and eat cheese pizzzza
---
Wow
---
Does your sister also playÔºü
---
If you don't mind me asking, what did you use to make this?
---
its mordecai from regular show
---
How much trophies did your brawler have?
---
ExCUse mE WHataF*cK
---
You could buy them but then you still can't upgrade her because you wouldn't have enough coins
---
This is bullying
---
Wouldn't the notch interfere with your gameplay? Different screens have different sizes, so they will have to enlarge/shrink and I feel like the picture will become unproportional.
---
I'm not complaining about the last photo, but the first and second ones... IMO also the power of the brawler can increase the precision of the matchmaking
---
Same thing happened to me. Would have been funny if youd had your super.
---
If I was one of those mikes every other mike would have died. 
---
Ghost Guitarist 
---
Thanks
---
Any concepts that includes more free boxes is a good concept 
---
But why did you include it?
---
I'd argue that they should give him an hp boost and drastically reduce his range to like nita or primo.

---
guess i\`ll be the winner 
---
There is a mobile app or website called [https://brawlstats.com/](https://brawlstats.com/) and it tells you your highest trophies you had on a single brawler. Just add your player tag and you can access your profile, leader boards and upcoming maps and events
---
oooh yes, before I realized it and I had to make another blog with the same drawing and the size of the contest üòÇ Thanks for the warning!! 
---
I think it should be sorted by recently used brawlers
---
Oh
---
 Thanks tho
---
One other thing is if you have seven or less letters/numbers on your Player Tag can basically label you as OG.
---
Excuse me what the f*ck
---
Too bad it‚Äôs true
---
Thanks!! 
---
10/10 they were good at the re design 
---
Do you mean Brawl Stars is the Supercell's only game that doesn't have a daily chests or something else?
---
It's possible
---
Perfection
---
[deleted]
---
I‚Äôd usually direct people to r/lootstars but I can let posts like these slide.
---
¬øTiene que ser dibujado o podemos editar?
---
Possible if you derank again(lose trophies)
---
Lol why are there so many dynamites
---
U could get bo from brawl boxes before the trophy road existed 
---
You could once get bo from a brawl box
---
Darry doesn't need a buff, he is better now
---
This is much better some other dumb skins I've seen, it's less extravagant (I've seen like tophat/romance Leon like he's an assassin where'd you get this idea from lol)
---
I'm crying and shaking I have never seen true art before. 
---
Better than 10 bulls 
---
I am an OB. Are you
---
I'm on the youtuber team just great lol soon gonna be on the enemy team, just let me pull leon you'll see
---
Siiiiiick!!
---
But there will be certainly an other overused brawler, I think fixing a limit of 2 same brawlers is not a bad idea
---
I think by Beta they're meaning the Star Shelly and Brawlidays skins (even though they aren't beta)... );
---
Very cool, I'd like to see it in the game! 
---
Link to repost for downvotes, insert here.
---
Link to OG for upvotes, insert here.
---
I mean it does in a roundabout way as within 100 boxes you should get enough coins to buy one
---
Brawl Stars *was* originally meant to be space themed... So possibly... Still doesn't seem right to me tho
---
r/Alabama
---
But for Leon to kill you it's like 0.00000000000000001 seconds
---
It went global a month ago
---
Omfg... FML
---
You could try the sub r/brawlrecruit or look on discord. There is a discord for this subreddit that should be linked in the sub description. 
---
I have over 4000 trophies and 0 legendarys
---
After that shit 3d update, this is necessary
---
They promote this omegalul 
---
Que chevere
---
Lmao facts. I've been avoiding gem grab specifically because it feels like blind luck being paired with players who practically hand over wins with their carelessness, among other stupid things. 
---
OH.

This is my entry
---
"careful, he's a hero"
---
They‚Äôre only visible to her
---
Why did you do this 
---
Yeah destroy that dirty teamer
---
Im not saying teaming doesnt happen, im saying 5 dynamikes teaming doesnt happen, just cause you played during beta doesnt make you autimattically smarter than everyone else...
---
That means you have 13 brawlers and 2600 trophies. That‚Äôs not bad luck lol
---
How do I enter? Someone please tell me, I started drawing before this even happened, because I am such a big fan.. XD
---
Fuck u
---
Thanks u/Totoro34 , very cool!
---
I'll check
---
But the thing is... it‚Äôs a repost. 
---
A bit, but backgrounds don't usually call for good detail and the darker at the top to lighter at the bottom is a nice touch.
---
what repost, I just spent like 10-20 mins making it, hence why my name is on it
---
This looks fun actually. But I'd like to know rules, like how do you win? Does the big boss lose health? Can you respawn?
---
Exactly, it doesn‚Äôt make much sense. However there def could be some better rewards considering some players like me get 10 coins every single day
---
Alabama now
---
Yup I know I am still noob :D
---
Yea, I wanna see killa, assists and deaths after my games
---
This meme was a version where it said did you get the star key and he did but it cost everything with randoms. This is literally the same thing but one box is slightly different. 
---
she really needs a ghostbuster skin
---
The team that beat the enemy big brawler will win 
---
And the 5 others will respawn 
---
If you really want to, go back to the posts 6 months ago with stormy plains, this is a common. And actually, me being a beta player means that I have more experience in the game so technically it does make me smarter than everyone else or...maybe I should you and you alone since your -7 ppl doesn‚Äôt represent everyone.
---
When it comes down to midgame solo showdown, focus on the shot gunners/short ranged brawlers to the point of ignoring other squishy brawlers. 
---
Imagine if you had your super that would be the fastest five kills ever
---
EXCELLENT POST FRANK, IT'S GOOD TO KNOW THAT THE DATA IS OK, BUT STILL HAS A SUB PAR FEELING. 
---
That warmed my heart. So satisfying üòÇüëå
---
manual aiming leaves the room...
---
Ok i will do the contest 
---
It‚Äôs for the contest üòÅ
---
BRAZZERS
---
we don't need any new brawlers, stop being so greedy
---
But also a Victory
---
B...but mortis is a brawler
---
Ok man this is rly fucking good I hope you know that

This would be kind of weird to implement, and a few problems may arise. First of all, if the player base is not large enough, because of the fact that there are now 2 different matchmakes for each mode, matchmaking will take longer. This could be argued by saying that you put competitive and casual into the same match, but that creates a different problem. You could have 3 accounts, go into casual, and give out free trophies to people in competitive by throwing the match.
---
Love this! But doesn‚Äôt the el primo seem a little small? Lol
---
Personally I think this might speed up game progression too much.
---
I have been waiting for that offer to reappear in my shop for a long time. Why did they have to have the level packs start cycling along with other deals?
---
Im not even gonna argue with you, theres other people who made the same point as me, you're just being toxic.
---
So nice
---
Okay they should actually do this
---
Aimbot
---
I think mortis is the same speed as el primo
---
Thanks 
---
Easy he chucks it of his shoulder bouncing and going toward the target
---
Blur out yo own name but no one else‚Äôs 
---
Yeah, but I still can't use controllers on my notches, kind of making my screen smaller than my brothers screen, which isn't notched, same dimensions, except I have a notch and he doesn't, makes my screen smaller, kind of a little tweak but could make it a lot more comfortable
---
People say that leon is so strong and needs a nerf but without him then the throwers will dominate again.
---
that was literally me a few days ago
---
About $20 to do your job for you. Pass.
---
Are you seriously complaining about the prize? If you have a problem with the prize, don't enter into the competition!
---
Iign = ThomasGN. You‚Äôll see that my highest rated is Bull @~260. Mostly because I bumrush vault with him in heist and people are bad. I don‚Äôt really use him out of heist ever
---
Alright, I had just assumed you where f2p, you might be a lil unlucky. It just rlly annoys me when there are people less then 3k trophies complaining about legendaries, meanwhile there are 10k+ ppl like me who have either 1 or no legendaries. I guess I‚Äôm just tryna say there are ppl who have it way worse than you. 
---
ive played for about 2-3 hours now this evening and so far im at roughly 15 trophies gained total... this is my evening.. every evening lol.
---
Well. The new map for it says no. 
---
Birdman is that you?
---
Why would you be offended by the word royal?
---
You have a point. I think people overexaggerate how bad randoms are. I've had plenty of amazing random players who I've added and still play with all the time, even Kairos likes playing with randoms... Makes you a better player. Although I haven't been playing for too long, I've climbed to 7.1k trophies almost with randoms only. 
---
Where is pam ? 
---
This needs to be uploaded differently. Upload it to Imgur or a separate reddit post and then comment the link.
---
üëÄ

Bull darryl primo and Shelly can also 3 shot them. 1344 damage for mortis is fine. 
---
Heh all the youtubers said it sucked. You remember the bombshell ‚ÄúOOF‚Äù that lex dropped on Ryan of course

Where is it? Can't see it

WHAT THE FUCK

---
No
---
Another bull pushing noob dont worry I know 3 others u r not the first
---
Bull what have you done?! You‚Äôve broken our house! üòÇ
---
I like how you tried to team and yet you‚Äôre complaining when people team up against you. This should be under humour
