Awesome 
---
---
---
Lmao this really caught me off guard 
---
I like how brawl stars is not toxic, but this is gonna make it be extra toxic
---
Well yes, but actually no. Because then Island Invasion would have even more teaming and more shotgunners. The current Island Invasion is literally such a bad and unbalanced map that it cannot function without meteors.
---
Good!
---
Reduce duplicated  brawlers so will be less lobber teams
---
It's about time we have some stats showing. This is j excellent menu. 
---
Similar??? What? Just starting with the heal, Pam is a slow heal involving time and the turret not dying, and Poco does burst healing. One is area control and one does everything. It's like comparing Nita to Leon, the only thing they share is being super annoying in Showdown. Pam is broken anyway.
---
Crank it up
---
Is crow bad? No. If he good in this current meta? Yes 
---
When you go to the middle there's no back to the other boats (ships).I think that will make Bull happy xD.
---
Right now that's important for determining the star player, I believe. But I think the gems lost are not accounted, so maybe the damage is more relevant.
---
I love how everyone believes Poco does something like 1 damage, until I get a teamwipe. Four hits at at power 9 is close to 4k damage...
---
Great idea. The game could use some QoL
---
Why has this man not been hired yet
---
No teaming at all 
---
 NOOOOOOOOOOOOO (dunno who that is) WHY NOOOOOOOO
---
Gr8 map but you should get rid of the 1 tile gaps because they are annoying to walk through
---
Can enemies see the shotgunner?
---
Where did your comment go? Hello u/deelee23? I wont bite, unlike you.

Thank you!

HOW
---
Try the official brawl stars discord server. It's full of low level player at 6k and lower. There's a few 10+k
---
I can't play with him normally anymore
---
Probably get copyright issues🤣
---
[removed]
---
Same but my dad I got screwed lol
---
How do i access it cuz i already tried to find it
---
Strongly disagree on bathtub Carl, would replace it with dino Darryl or Carnival Pam
---
Yeah because you’re too stupid to know how to use it properly
---
Try killing one on your own. The Poco will put up a fight, and if it's not a Pam they will die eventually.
---
Try putting /r/BrawlStars
---
Rip
---
Me: Has a perfectly good 5 bar Wifi.
---

---
Supercell: Let's pretend that's a super bad 0 bar Wifi and still make his game lag!
---
It’s kind of similar to Gene’s super, just not quite as limited, and the regular attack is much less powerful
---
Ah, little Dynamike..
---
*That is

Jessie shoots
---
ℭ𝔯𝔬𝔴  𝔦𝔰 𝔰𝔬 𝔠𝔲𝔱𝔢!

I have no mythics but I have 2 legendaries rip
---
Congratulations 🎉👏🎉
---
I think it should also include damage dealt since that is what’s used in finding star player 
---
gordon ransay would be "dynamike congratz you won your dream restaurant"

El Primo: I have it *but...* _**EEELL PRRRIIMMMOO!**_ *suddenly uses his super on the enemy team while also having low health*

I think the extra gems was due to the 1111 coins pal
---
It’s exactly the same but you changed the name and put showdown
---
People are thankful when they get 3 gems but you get all cocky when you get 12 gems (9% chance to get gems and within that 9% you have a 3% chance of getting 12 gems)

Welp they never responded or did anything so I can't help you either

Always 
---

---
Is this how SuperCell gets their sick kicks?
---
EEEEEEEEL PRIMOOOOOOOOO
---
Technically a Primo would have more deaths than the gem carrier or a support because he would be very aggressive. 
---
Also the gem carrier would carry more gems than the others. 
---
Also also the support is likely to have more kills than the others, so the stats are not much of a good comparison of player skill/contribution. 
---

Hii there

Hey fuck off

So I bought Spike on Friday (The offer on the store) then got Crow on a free Box on Saturday (I freaked out) now, like a huge % of players, I'm only missing leon. 
---
Man... Went from Zero Legendaries to two in less than 24 hours. Wow. 
---
And Crow
---
And nerf Pam as well
---
*time to get constructive*
---
We don't need another brawler that's only useful if you hide in the bushes.
---
But I enjoy the silly players who think it's a good idea to use these brawlers in a wide open bounty map. When they're on the other team of course. 
---
Bo Only works with his star power 
---
Wow, you got to 500 trophies in Solo? How completely original. And you did it the hardest way too..... not.
---
A Rico can easily get 2nd places

Silly!! how a tennis ball  bounces from a brawler to  another

1. Welcome to the beginning of your new life. 
---
2. Nerf Pam

3. BUFF CROW

4. As you learn to play Poco, you'll see that he is perfectly capable of wrecking everyone( Except a safe)
---
5. Read 4
---
it looks likes Boruto's eye
---
excuse me?
---
keep in mind this map was made for duo showdown, and in duos there isn't any teaming.
---
Truue but hmmmmmm okay I can take that idea

Haha thanks u made my day

Lol, you’ll learn to carry randoms, in time...

Can't wait

HAH A HA HAHAHAH AHAH A HA  LMAOOO
---
Carl on steroids
---
as a Shelly main i felt that 😫
---
You spinned...
---
No people just need to learn that someone like shelly is good against the boss but bad at being the boss and jessie has the opposite issue. What you should use is someone like crow barley or daryl which are decent at both 
---
Your missing 1 coin
---
Mortis: Attack me once and youre all power cubes.
---
Oh god oh frick
---
Yeahh
---
Haha gj take my upvote😂😄👌🏻
---
You can dodge brock as much as you can dodge Piper. If the gas is closing in and you have less space. Brock has more chances of surviving and the burst damage is greater as you are forced to be closer to other brawlers
---
???
---
BEAARRR!

Not my fault you dont understand what you're saying. I'm speaking English, not German.

Hey dude that’s me lol. I’m the dynamike.
---
Lmfao you legit held him hostage, poor dyna 💀 
---
those peasant numbers I have 19/24 at 6.7k and no mythics and only Leon (BTW everyone always says im lucky for having Leon but it seems like a curse since i can't get new brawlers now)
---
u/ParisStunPlays
---
Those stats are surprisingly accurate 
---
I have make this, its not stolen
---
Ok👌thanks bout your feed, i'll continue to make maps
---
You do realize that Mortis can kill him whenever he wants with no problem so he's just messing with him
---
Yeah yeah yeah there you are with the guilt trips again. Everyone has been through tough shit in their life, stop begging for sympathy. It’s pathetic
---
DUDE IKR. People are like "Dont complain you have Leon". NO THAT'S NOT HOW IT WORKS. Yes, I have leon, but my luck for anything else is dead
---
Crow
---
New brawler: Mortis's bat?
---
crow he's the one who can fly and since he's a bird i'm just gonna assume that the tracker jackers won't attack him
---
My footbull wants to know your location now thanks i guess
---
If one person in your game has 400 your good for replays 
---
Confused at how "carried" and "grabbed" are so equivalent to you that you interchange the words freely.
---
Leon- missing
---
because PAM has a very large range and quite wide splash and the walls do not hinder the nuts
---
This will be abused and never be used correctly.
---
It will never happen bc good players will get bad ratings if they mess up the game at the end, even if they carried
---
Looked at this for 10 minutes, finally got it😂
---
I don't think so. Even if none of my teammates reach 400, I still can watch replay. It's like this: [https://imgur.com/OmsA1b7](https://imgur.com/OmsA1b7)
---
Did i beg? Did i say i want sympathy? Whos gonna give it? Who wants to give it? You are a hypocrite, claiming im a scumbag, guilt tripping me by saying i hated you personally (i mentioned i didnt btw). Look im gonna wrap it up here.

Dont say anything if you cant be a decent human being.

It can still be considered symbiosis even if it's not mutually beneficial. If it's even parasitic, it is still a symbiotic relationship. 
---
I thought primo loses 23 gems
---
This is like a lost connections add. “To that Shelly and dynamike I connected eyes with in siege....”
---
#lets get this party started!
---
Spike, I am main mortis but sp8ke's star power is pretty good
---
Crow shouldn't be a hunger games participant: he should be the gamemaker's muttation (if you read it).
---
Also, mike should replace leon because district 12 specialises in miners
---
Penny - while everyone goes for the middle, she wreaks havoc with her splash attack
---
Either that or one thicc boi (i.e. Pam)
---
eyes wallow com

Ummm is Nita imitating others? I guess idk like if you agree.

Yeah

Nice, I got leon in 800

The guy probably was hoping not to be Big Brawler. Frank's stun is powerful against the Big Brawler since then they can Super Stack.

I enjoy his game pay style more then LEON, leon is just plain booooooorinnng

Too bad man but this is not going to happen, if it wasnt for these "worthless devs" Brawl Stars wouldnt exist in the first place, and now you're saying "we dont need you anymore, this is our game now" ? Thats a dick move, even worse than the "devs who do nothing". So try to calm down because things will change as long as we talk about them. Maps and balance changes are already being implemented into the game because of us (more or less...), we do have a big impact on this game if we want to. And no, giving the game to the community would only kill it faster. There needs to be a compromise and in this case its best if Supercell keeps running the game (even tho they would never give it to the community because they need to make money, thats just how it works). Honestly I never thought I'd have to argue about this but here we are

It seems to me that 3 maps are not enough, I think that you need to make a maximum so that you can post up to 5 maps

Thank you!😊

Lol you screen shot it and took a video of it lol

Wait Leon's a dude xD I thought she was a girl

I’m going to commit Shelly supered

Wait, that's illegal.

I do have Tara :D

You pay the gems and get 19 bull points plus however many coins the remaining power points equate to. So basically yes.

You do realize it's April Fool's and there's this thing called Photoshop, right? I HIGHLY doubt someone tilted this hard with 6 brawlers and still managed to have almost 10000 trophies among the other 18
---
No no...I can feel the Real 'fun' in these trophies.But if I don't play with my friends.I lost every game.Because noob...
---
Supercell has a vacancy for a 3D artist and they would love if GEDI-KOR applied but he’s still learning 3D art. 
---
Lovely artwork tho UwU 
---
You have a fence in the corners, if you break there will be a gap in one block, can you fix it?
---
Perfection
---
No, because playing with randoms gives your team a big disadvantage because you don’t have a solid teamcomp.

I got 220 for Leon. Is it worth the 39 gems?

How the crap did you find this 2 month old post?

you ever just take a dynamike as hostage

I never get ehy pipers would use their ult to stay in the same place it makes them really easy to kill
---
Do you even understand what I asked about? 
---
Hey bro he's the best brawler in the game but i don't think he's worth 550 gems because you can get him from a brawl box for absoloutley free.
---
How many brawlers do you have?
---
I mean, you should buy it if you want to. Have you played with or against spike before and if so do you think you’d like to play hin?
---
I've got an offer like this for pam, do you know what happens if I buy it? Will I just get a bunch if coins? 
---
Yeah, online status. If you have do not disturb on it makes it to where you’re appearing offline.
---
If that is true than you are justifiable in your artistic skills. If so than you are a relatively good artist for your age. Sorry for my previous deprications.

I have everything but crow and leon. I'm at 3200

I don’t know it doesn’t help that you’re not showing your trophy count or the ones of your teammate and his teammate :p

No it doesn't , it just shows that you are on DND , it doesn't hide your online status.

I’ve been waiting for so long😍😍😍

Just get him. Spike is currently the best brawler in the game and so is the skin so get him before supercell nerfs him.

And what I was taking about???? I was asking for ppl to not know that you're online. And DND doesn't do that. 
---
It sucks to play in this map. The dynamikes team, charge their super and clear the centre. If you play a shotgun brawler, there is no place you can go. You have to play mortis or a thrower
---
Shut the up and ready
---
I’m at like 6k trophies. I’m still missing him and Leon. 
---
Ok... it’s almost as if saying “speech 0” was also a joke
---
Do spike
---
Why does it even matter, it’s not like anyone can bother you anyway. Why do you need to ghost ppl?

I also got a leon and he is my first lvl 8 so that was a great deal

i think Clash Royale will get buff

U get the special ones like 39 for 30 gems or 29 for 30 i m not sure. I dont buy the regular ones.

Aye its gamma great!

They can look like us, but they will never BE us.

Yes you totally need to report people for doing what the game is LITERALLY MADE FOR.

If you can get at least 28 tokens per ticket in robo rumble then you should buy the biggest ticket offer. 
---
Got one for Leon too, but I’m 5 points away from max lol. Wish it was for a different brawler. 
---
Great map 
---
You literally came like a reaper, for each one of them, which makes sense, Mortis is kind of a reaper? 
---
Buy of course if you can buy the token doubler offer then you should buy the doubler
---
Nice
---
Yah I know right. I had to do it to the teamers
---
Play cavern churn he is op, if u don t meet barley and dyna team
---
Crow doens't need a buff People don't know how to use him
---
Link?
---
dont
---
Honestly, I'm not a fan. The entire idea of cavern churn is that there's a lot of walls on the outside, and a huge mid with bushes. The map is separated into the different zones, which defines the map.
---
2 for each power pont

Dang that’s pretty rough. Prob will wait for the 25 on trophy road.

Ok, I didnt look at all your maps but so far most of them are just spam, you don't seem to bother to add proper cover and you always stick around with bad gameplay ideas like adding a lot of bushes next to each other, making the maps a game of who can spam auto aim faster instead of who is better. And one of your map isn't even finished, that river showdown map is just an idea, not an actual map. I'd say that from all your maps the best is Corner Town. It does have some one tile maps but it at leasts add something new to Heist and that is an open map for long range Brawlers so I can see myself giving that map a "pass", but the rest are all quantity over quality. Dont take this as a personal offense or something but try to make a small amount of maps with good gameplay than a lot of terrible ones.
---
No. Having every star power would, though.
---
you can’t buy more than the max needed to reach lv 9. the gems u have extra will roll over for the next level you want to upgrade to

Battle for those boxes and jump to the center island! Once you jump, there is no turning back! This map is great for all brawlers and 1v1 interactions!

Aahhhh... I see that you are a man of *iPhone X* as well

Can we send big game, robo rumble or boss figth maps too?

I  bet randoms would pick Piper for this map

Ahhhhhhhhg ok

Welcome to the buff crow gang! 😁
---
“Friends”
---
You’re right , but You would agree with me that he deserves a small buff to his damage 
---
WTF is this? Lol xD
---
I don’t know what you are talking about but when I open a brawl box I get around 8-15 pp everytime. With 15 boxes  I’d get around 160 pp. not that bad of a deal
---
I approve 
---
*John Cena
---
Poco doesn't give a shit!?
---
I don’t see why it would be a bug. The placement of the healing turret isn’t instantaneous. It has an animation and Frank stunned you before the animation was finished and therefore cancelled your super.
---
It is the exact same thing when shelly supers Frank while is doing his super. Because his animation is longer, when shelly supers in time, it will cancel Franks super
---
Primo does a better one when he loses
---
Lol, I vote Darryl

Mine is called Juggler. It's a Gem grab map with style!

This is a sex doll.

Which Omen band? Theres lots of branches

This is a masterpiece it's worth millions!

I want her voice to have some kind of Spooky echo to it
---
Well your supercell ID is tied to your email, so technically you should(unless they changed the adress) be able to log back in
---
Yeah, true
---
Yeah but the super button got reset....
---
Can't wait for the new update!
---
Definitely not an April Fools joke. \^-\^
---
7000 and no mythics or legendaries
---
Interesting, a post that comes from Instagram...
---
Its gonna be Carl since Crow is pretty good if you know how to play him, but Carl needs some work
---
\-\_-, good point. But his title says otherwise.
---
No nonononononononono no no nononon
---
Mortis is godly as boss easy wins
---
Sounds good a Brawler with a water gun, super is also exciting, unfortunately you should consider to write this in english cuz this sub is full with usa folks and they tend to not know other language that isn't english and will start to cry english please.
---
I'm 9.1K at 19, just got carl a few days ago

Does he *ban*Europeans 
---
Did ya know that they banned 25 k people for the Apeil fools hunger games?
---
Sure he is but Waiting to be Boss or even not having Mortis is a struggle
---
Mine has leon PowerPoints
---
Yeap that’s what happens. Your super is used the money you click on it or drag and let go. Therefore it will reset when it is cancelled but something else, because it was used anyway
---
They want it to be "SPECIAL"
---
True Mortis is really bad as a fighter but as big boss he is so fast 💨 ain’t no one catching him for a solid 3 minutes 
---
Please no more bush maps

I know that will added in april update, had I known wrong?
---
It’s not my account. You should open more boxes then lol. My main account is at like 2100 and I have crow. My alt account is at like 700 or so. And I have spike.
---
I don't thing my phone has one, it sucks
---
I mean... the tittle is true...
---
Here we see 6 Dynamikes teaming in their natural habitats... as you can see, the poison gas is slowly surrounding them and the poor Night Witch Mortis and Wizard Barley, but soon... Natural selection shall takes its course...
---
I’m 7700 and have 23. I just got piper and Carl so they are low
---
As if shooting through walls isn't more me mechanical than shooting, running back.
---
A new map for you all. Again criticism is welcome on how to improve it!
---
Oh fuck. poor transmortis
---
This does put a smile on my face
---
I dont think they can put 3 block thick walls in a boss battle due to dynamike though :(
---
Bring in a whole bunch of throwers and it really is an archer tower
