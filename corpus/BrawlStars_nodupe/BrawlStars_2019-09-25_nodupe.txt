Yes definetly I‚Äôve gotten a star power from my first one nothing from my second but then a star power and sandy from my third! I will continue to buy these and work hard to get enough star points for them!

Good idea. But whats the rarity

I think taking away trophies us too harsh, what if there is no wifi?

How did you do the thing where it says Darryl for u
---
That's your own opinion and shouldn't be posted on any subreddits
---
You give credit where you got it... if you didn‚Äôt make it then you clearly stole it. OP probably saved the original meme and then reposted it, why not give credit to the guy who made it?
---
This is so cute &lt;3
---
i mean it made her look younger as she should but she did need a bit of fine tuning here and there but otherwise i actually reallly liked it

I've gotten crow gene tara all the super rarest uncommons and crow out of the free ones my advice get 20 tickets and buy 2, 500 token doublers (50 each) and just go ham on the special events and grind for the big boxes

Nothing too crazy, just thought to post this so I could come back later and see it. (600 trophy Mortis)

I never team, even if I'm losing trophies

I think this super is a little op. Even though they have a slow movement speed, it's being invincible. Instead, I'd just make the super a movement buff since having 2 brawlers in one is a little op.

Really?

This actually scared me

Nice to hear from you El Primo. Been some time
---
I like how the flair is art
---
I don't know where you got that idea from, but it is not possible to get Star Points from chests
---
read question is why you tilted your brawlers so much üòÇ
---
Yo nice meme but credit them
---
I love it when the robo does that, its tiny legs just spaz out
---
and this is tagged as a bug because?

nice idea but would easily get outdated, and wouldn't be very good after a few months.

---
Too narrow space
---
Shelly, colt, bull, dyna, brock, bo(arrows), 8bit, primo, barley, poco, Rico, Carl, Bibi, piper, frank, Mortis, crow would all be pretty easy
---
That leaves Nita, tick, pam, Tara, gene, Leon, spike, and sandy.
---
Most of the spawners would just use their spawn except 8bit and pam
---
Pam‚Äôs would be either her gun which would look wierd or maybe just win/loss pose.
---
Tara would be super charged/uncharged.
---
Gene would be the hand going up/down
---
Leon would be Leon on both sides, but if you upvote he disappears.
---
Spike would be cactus on downvote and spike on upvote (idk)
---
Sandy would be sand on downvote and kairostime on upvote (again idk)
---
Darryl will need both shotguns in the picture or maybe steel hoops (upvote) vs rolling reload (downvote)
---
Rosa would be the little plant on her back
---
think*
---
Wow, well that checks off my reading for the month
---
ok
---
I‚Äôm just here to see +10k players with no legendaries getting triggered.

Congrats on getting Spike tho, he‚Äôs a ton of fun.
---
Yeah

You‚Äôve gotten all your tokens already so yea

My native language is not saying the English language correct terms, I was referring to take down with my comments in this thread.
---
I played with colt before and it seemed like an obvious choice. But with that labyrinth it did not work at all. Did not even get that better token. With Colt it is important to have room to move and have place to hide from robots firing. That level had none.
---
I love, not die very good for soul
---
What are we talking about?
---
Literally why I hate playing bounty and gem grab.
---
Thank you brother! I was about to push him to 800 this season but ended up at 792... Ahh. 
---
Anyways. Thanks for remembering me. I am going to start working soon.
---
;3/
---
I have played tuberculosis simulator
---
Took way too long to figure out what those were so ima have to say pass.
---
The thing with this game is that before trophy renewal the most unplayable place was around 300 trophies, it got better after it.
---
Now it is somewhere around 700. My Colt unfortunately is stuck at 550 after tokens were taken away on Monday. And I am lacking energy to drive him further because of what I said above.
---
And yes, I might not be the best player so I tend to only play levels and game modes where I have a change to do well at least most of the time.

This mode needs a lot of work and should be pulled until they fix it.

They have now evolved to include brawlers in the periodic table

Oh I rmb this mode btw ur "strat" is not the most op in life leach. There was a exploit where u could stay in the storm forever by collecting each other health after they die. I rmb doing it and gained A LOT if trophies but they patched it by the time most people knew about it
---
Thanks for meta post, karmawhore

I never touch tara and frank since i reached 500 trophies with them

Starvpower is just a slight buff to a brawler having the star power dealing more damage than main Attack is just dumb

Oh yea, Morris's fun factor would make him legendary imo

Repost

Colt's face tho

Everyone talking about leon not having a voice while darryl also doesnt have one AND he only has 1 skin which is limited...so I thin darryl deserves a skin +voice first, because leon recently just got a skin. I think its time for our barrel boi to get something.
---
buy
---
Ikr...
---
I mean at the very least. I am not comparing both or their largest drop. I am comparing what they should give you at the very least. If a big box is truly 3 small boxes worth than it should AT LEAST have 120coins. Either that or i have never gotten 30+coins for months

This is what huge numbers of players do, you mean.

See so many wasting time and dying both ganking and then being ganked around the edges of the map. Fight the fucking robot! Fair enough if someone comes close you‚Äôre not going to ignore them. But on the edges of the map?

Go and play showdown if all you‚Äôre doing is fighting other players. None of these people ever win Takedown either.

***Pizza Time.***
---
U need to aim? He is trickier than mike? I mean his low hp is fair and the use for ur super is for self defense, his range is really big and the area of his atack is so big that if u aim is bad u still land one mine, he is a spammy brawler with little counterplay.
---
You might get banned for this. Just letting you know. Better delete it  just a tip
---
XD
---
‚î¨‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¨‚ó°Ôæâ(¬∞ -¬∞Ôæâ) Amm... It is TRUE !

Lol we don‚Äôt need to deliberately lose to get a low win rate with Mortis. All you have to do is play for an hour or two, those losses will come.

Badly needs something buffed.

Lmao this kid u actually listened to me, but too late!

actually solid

---
Lets be clear here, when you say spam, you mean autoshoot spam, right? Cause if you autoshoot with tick you'll never hit a shot, ever. His attacks take like 1.5 seconds to hit the ground after he shot. And basically every high dps brawler can kill him: bull, darryl, shelly, 8-Bit, colt, leon, crow, sandy, spike, etc...
---
Ehh, not sure, but for me Leon is the worst legendary right now and Spike would actually rekt that invisible bOi

I see "LOL" in a shape of lake in the map. Nice

Across the board. Otherwise, there‚Äôs no point in playing him; brawlers like Bibi, Rosa and El Primo are better candidates.

Playing solo is the worst with crow, i pushed him to 800 in duo sd, for 3v3 i would say just play him on maps he is good even without a good team comp (i can't say what maps tho, but there should be 1 or 2 maps he is good on, even without a premade team), on most other maps he is good too, but just with a good team comp, well i stick to duo sd and don't play any other mode with him

17k no legendary. There is always someone unluckier
---
Only cuz ur below 5k but idk why people around 1-5k get legendaries so easily?
---
Yeah... Long star be like...
---
You are matching against trophies and nothing more. So if you are that trophy range with your star power, then you should be there, if you are better you will be moved up by playing and limit the number of difficult games for everyone else.

1‚≠ê Power is a Teleport gun, the oponent that's been hit by it gets teleported behinde next wall.

2‚≠ê Power is for Porting friends directly in front of oponents with full shoots.

r/isitreallyasub
---
Was playing Rico for the first time in weeks today. Remembered that if you know how to angle your shots, you are untouchable and great DPS. I can only pull off the ricochets in very specific scenarios. I am not untouchable and great DPS.
---
...yes it does
---
See you can‚Äôt even use mortis as much because he ALWAYS has to dodge
---
Please, my eyes cannot burn anymore or they will pop.

Special offer vs daily offer. Two different things.

I've actually had an easier time in solo than duo with crow.

You're the one the prophets spoke of

I kinda mastered rico but not totally yet
---
Helped me get to 19000 trophies
---
I got leon when you got crow
---
It's just his art style

I wonder if it has anything to do with his username

Oh god

How do i get that?

I would totally by that

Spike in the right waiting for a **hug

Do you blame them? your at low health and if they can get a cheap power up in 3 seconds then why not?
---
Bottom left post. They really cut out my username name at the corner.
---
Now i have every brawler except Sandy. Before i got Gene, i only needed to get 4 more brawlers to lvl9 (8bit, Tara, Rosa, and the one with the bat [replying while im class]
---
Go to the sun's main page, click the dots and then user flaire. You can choose from all the brawlers
---
Which is unfair, trophies shouldn't be the only factor accounted in matchmaking
---
Being power 1 doesn't help situation either and I got him to 556 and still pushing at power 1

Omg so good i love your art keep it up

I‚Äôm a fake account?

I would join if I had Mortis. He looks really fun to play but my luck is terrible and I don't have any mythics and legendaries except for spike

this image is cursed

It's for design

I have now started to hate brawl stars Reddit now 
---
Everyone is spamming BUFF MORTIS whereas he is completely balanced 
---
His both star powers are S tier and still everyone is spamming BUFF MORTIS???
---
Any brawlers with low health doesn't even stand a chance against coiled snake mortis
---
You can change opacity on paper. Paper is see-through when there's light on the other side.
---
You said "what can i do with lvl10 tick in 3v3 mode you have to show us is solo
---
but like the old one had more character. He was supposed to be a person in the gold rush, now he just looks like a miner
---
My favourite legendary is Shelly.

To everyone who's complaining about Sandy:
---
  
---
#He's using his Super
---
They must really like it then.
---
Not to be a downer or anything, but i they do this the prices will change (a lot)
---
With robo retreat, Rico became much better at showdown, because when you lose health, it's easier to do "dribbles"
---
Awesome work. You deserve an award
---
Its a great visual idea but i think it feels strange, an arrow with the proyectile speed of jessie is weird and a dragon with that high attack speed feels weird too
---
I agree but I dont think leon needs a buff. All legendaries except maybe sandy are balanced.
---
P.S. and spike's curveball is a little bit op I think...
---
MAXIMUM DAMAGE

You just got a new follower. You are spitting facts and I like it.

Remember. We got 28 new star powers during Summer! We don't need 3rd star powers at all right now and we don't need them any time soon, so why bother posting ideas of star powers(not you) that supercell probably doesn't even see? Skins, brawlers, NEW goddamn memes and not those overused lame as hell "i want a legendary" memes etc, art. That's what the subreddit needs lol.
---
What did dynamike do wrong?
---
His best game modes are brawl ball and bounty.   Showdown is full of too many tanks.  
---
Brawl ball takes a lot of skill.  Have to practice passing the ball to yourself and rushing up to it.  
---
Bounty is filled with a lot of long range squishies so you just have to dodge attacks until you can get in close.   Use walls and put pressure on the other team
---
Never rush into multiple opponents unless you can get two of them in one attack.   You‚Äôll get burst down.   If you can‚Äôt pick people out stay close to your teammates and try to provide support.   You might not be able to 1v1 a bull but if it tries to rush a teammate you can take him down with the help of your buddy.  
---
It‚Äôs also underrated how well mortis can bait out attacks.   Stay at the edge of your enemies range and get them to waste ammo on you.   Then just dodge it by moving or by using a rush attack.  Even if you aren‚Äôt helping by damaging you can make it so they enemy team has less ammo to aim at your friends.  
---
If you do want to play showdown with him you have to play conservative.   Don‚Äôt get caught in between two brawlers and try to ambush weak brawlers from a bush.   Your goal should be to survive till you can get second place.   You can try to steal power up boxes from enemies but it‚Äôs dangerous.   Can end up taking last if you screw up.
---
I know I'm replying to an old thread, but that's definitely NOT Slovak.
---
I agree
---
I bought caveman frank by accident, and I‚Äôm usually low on gems :(
---
I agree its so annoying...
---
By cato
---
He is a assassin so play like a assassin. In gem grab and brawl ball get the gems or the ball as fast as you can. In showdown its best to camp in a bush and you can steal power cubes easy. And throwers are easy to kill as mortis
---
Relax every1 has diff opinions
---
Pretty sure it‚Äôs 17 seconds or something close to that

What does the silver reward do
---
yes r/cursedbrawlstars
---
You think thats great? He has got 2 ricos
---
Nice really. Nice.
---
Frick is the best, because Frank's face is smaller
---
I defend tick because he is not a braindead brawler. Im at 12k trophies and he's in my top 5 favorite brawlers. Im getting him at rank 20 right now.
---
Then you have them backwards.
---
But it adds effects and that‚Äôs what makes games look better and more enjoyable
---
That was amazing.
---
But the thing is spike is stronger than Leon..
---
Ok im being real im at 16k and my max tick reached 650, and that for me shows that he is a braindead brawler, also to be honest kynda boring to play, dyna is way more fun to play.
---
I bought mecha crow because of this :(
