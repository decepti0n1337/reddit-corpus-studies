Sir, can i ask what your doing in a 10 day old post?
---
Sorry for all of the players bullying you for teaming. 
---
Shaggy
---
I need this...
---
No... WE need this!
---
Ooo so big and bad now that you're cussing. You can't spell, and you dont want to explain anything because you dont know what you said. And it's not a robbery, and clash of clans has nothing to do with this. You're being reported and blocked. Have a nice day.

I will have 60 boxes saved up for carl by the time he is released. Hope I get 1 legendary too.

He or she said they don't know how to 3D model well (Turning it backwards and sideways) and need little more practice with it

Yeah it's a serious complaint. Trophy road rewards suck. So do you.

Laser eyes! That explains why she keeps her eyes closed. Thank you and congratulations for solving the mistery!

Jokes aside, great artwork, as always.

When I put "Art" it means that they are my assemblies/edits !!

Make it 1 gems for 1000 coins
---
Ugh I hate that
---
Oh haha
---
F indeed
---
Hey thats pretty good
---
It's not my fault if my internet is bad ;-;
---
what exactly is the idea here
---
 other than the ones you've stolen without credit
---
Agreed
---
Thank you! 
---
Not really. After 300+ brawler trophies is bascically as popular as camping.
---
Imma explain more.
---
I play crow, you know, that guys with high damage potential but cant take one fricken hit. I end up being pushed back because i need cover so i dont die against (someone i hate as crow), Brock. I go up and i see a Nita, for example, running after me. With the clouds pushing me so i would have nowhere to go, i choose the only way id even stand a chance to get out, team with one. I spin, pray im luckly, and the nita ignores me. I run away, and end up getting 4th instead of 10th. Conclusion, teaming is needed if it means i dont lose 7 hard earned trophies. (Real match if you didnt pick up on that)
---
Thanks! God, your name is Funtime too :0
---
:0
---
I had that as well and legitimately considered it before realizing it was over 200$
---
Lol same
---
This is such a sweet idea! I would love for it to be implemented.
---
She looks great with that beard... üåùüåö
---
Is this a bug? Geez. A hilarious one if it is, I know supercell likes money but that‚Äôs pushing it
---
Can‚Äôt have one exit out of the spawn like that, people will be relentlessly spawn camped coming off the jump pad.
---
I been in that same kind of situation, but I don‚Äôt spin, I fight back and if I‚Äôm close to death, I just go in the clouds since Ik they will get lower up if they try getting my power cubes, and when your crow, you can just lure Nita towards Brock, since you already have fast speed, so you can dodge well, or you can fight back, since crow is a toxic assassin, he can keep chipping the enemies until their hp is dangerously low and they start to back off.
---
Enough of tanks
---
What's season 3? There are still people playing fortnite?
---
Wow! So teaming and knowing how to play the game are mutually exclusive? 
---
Tell me, how does not know ‚Äúhow to play the game‚Äù if they team?
---
Honestly, thats way too risky even for someone who really knows how to dodge. Mabye if like  less than 6 are left ill try but not if 4-7 trophies are at stake.
---
Report his ass
---
Nahhh I really miss tap to shot. Good old days when mortis could kill a shelly or bull 
---
Well we got 2 good 3D artist around...it would be nice if they did
---
she is not
---
man, she has 18 power cubes, energy drink and her super... 
---
THAT IS BEYOND HUMANITY
---
More like when you have 11 gems and go back to get that extra gem
---
Is this some kind of peasant joke I‚Äôm too rich to understand?
---
#dies of laughter
---
You joined the club with this post.
---
It‚Äôs just based on the drops you get from the boxes. If you continue to get powerpoints and coins, your luck will continue to increase but getting gems and anything else will decrease your luck: 
---
That's the best part when primos or other low damage brawler try to sneak up on you and you are one hit away from super üòÇ
---
Thx for the positivity but I‚Äôm guessing as a global player, I‚Äôm not as good as you but I am good enough to get a 500 frank if I vsed people around my characters power level

Thank u all my friends! Thank you for your interest in my career. Brawlstars is looking for a 3d member, not looking for me. However, since I can do a bit of 3d, I prepare hard and try to challenge 'later'. I want to participate in their game production, but I know i am not enough to become a pro. There are quite many designers I admire. I will try hard and try to walk by them.
---
P.s. Please do not swear or spam the supercell. I will work hard to meet your expectations. :)
---
Yeah, Will remove post, am pretty high lol
---
He‚Äôs more like El primo

No problem, it's good practice for me :P

He seems underpowered, cuz if u see a random bush, its kinda obvious where he is

Pocos star power is kind of Fire with the new buff

I said teaming was ruining the game and he just said we had already talked about it. 
---
Not this crap 
---
I feel u man, got my first at 8000
---
I actually like this idea as long as they are balanced 
---
Well yeah they‚Äôd have to be really balanced or things could get messy 
---
Yes, and I understand.  But you also have to see how I was coaxed into making a purchase that resulted in monetary loss.

I wish we could change the gem grab one to anything we want. I'd never have to play it again.

This reminds me of when all the game consoles had left handed controllers

I agree. I recently had to replace my phone and ran into this same thing.

It‚Äôs kinda a bug that if you throw your ball as or before the walls are destroyed the hit box of the wall doesn‚Äôt fully disappear

Idk but apparently my teacher called it y intercept form lol
---
buy the one you like the best 
---
You accuse teamers of
---
1: "exploiting game mechanics"
---
I think spinning is allowed by the joystick
---
2: "didnt put in hard work"
---
we chose the easy way, you didnt. not our problem.
---
Just because we are a teamer doesnt mean we complain about crap randoms.
---
You say teaming is a thing  "game developers said they didn't want to happen."
---
uhh, supercell allowed teaming.
---
Also, your entire argument is a fallacy.
---
There is no link between being a teamer and " Playing aggros as gem carriers", or "bunching up", or " Crow and Mortis in Siege".
---
My best guess why u wrote this?
---
you lost a lot of trophies due to bad randoms and youre blaming it on the teamers. This is beyond despicable. Youre bringing up irrelevent examples and just blantantly blaming teamers. People like you is whats wrong in this game. Youre the kind of person who is a sore loser and just blames your problems for being shit on someone else.
---
My advice: shut up and stop playing brawl stars. Nobody likes a sore loser. I dont think non-teamers would be happy if I blamed all my problems on them. 
---
What if I said that non-teamers are the problems in brawl stars because they continuously flame teamers, causing the brawl stars community to be split it half? But i wouldnt say that. 
---
You know why? Im not like you. 
---
Crow doesn't deal Splash damage for any of his abilities.
---
Piper can do splash damage with her super.
---
This literally ended my streak on kahoot. Fml rip
---
Its shooting you with his love
---
Finally.
---
Love this. Wouldn't it be cool if there's a justice league and avengers themed skin! 
---
Can you make 3D model BAT BO or Cleopatra Tara skin for me, if it's not difficult for you? If you can't I will not be offended.

If only there was a super for piper 
---
It‚Äôs all situational at some point. If there‚Äôs a team of 5 dynamike‚Äôs, I‚Äôm probably not gonna backstab the only player that gives me a shot at positive trophies. Everyone has this false sense of pride when it comes to teaming, like it isn‚Äôt a kid‚Äôs mobile app. I don‚Äôt get it.

How are you so deluded? You call that an exposure? All they did was read my post and deny it, its amazing how useless the support team for such a big game can be. They didn't even bother looking into it and just denied that it happened.

Probably a good map to prevent Jessie's domination as well

Nah I like gedi KOR but I don't like that people are spamming posts to get him hired in supercell and gedi KOR doesn't like that that's why hate it you are better
---
This community became so cancer... People just get triggered when they see someone teaming lmao, like, it happens in every match above 400 trophies on a brawler. Ignore them.
---
ahh see? youre being toxic right now. you just stated that you dont care about teamers, which is being rude, and thus toxic. calling people toxic even though they may not shows that youre rude, and thus toxic. Hey, teamers do care if others enjoy the game. they offer you to team by spinning. If you dont spin, the youre not considered teaming and therefore you will get teamed upon. U had a choice to team, but u refused. Not our problem. 
---
tbh teaming still requires more skill then playing pam 
---
And also, dont try copying me and add tbh to the front of the sentence and fyi at the back. In your case the fyi was uncalled for since i didnt ask for that info, and thus you shouldnt say "fyi". 
---
Alright? if we are going to debate at least get your english right. Thanks.

I don't get it sorry xd what's the point

#Vietnam Flash Backs Concur 
---
please
---
I hated it when SC started throwing out free shit in clash royale. It ruined the game and I‚Äôd rather grind thousands of trophies in order to unlock a single skin than that.       Somewhere between those two extremes could be nice though.
---
A bit strong for his normal attack don‚Äôt yah think? Essentially nullifying pam and poco super and star power as well as gene‚Äôs star power.
---
But I feel like you‚Äôre onto something, maybe when he uses his super? Or on his star power?
---
Bull Pen is too similar to Pokemon HGSS Location: National Park 
---
I'm at 4.9k with 21 brawlers. I'm sorry for you
---
Jessie does NOT nees a buff. Why are you comparing jessie to gene anyway, the only way for gene to deal damage is his normal attack. Jessie has turrets. Jessie is actually super hard to deal with especially if she has star power. The turret deals 300+ damage per hit which more than compensates for the damage she lacks on her normal attack. Against grouped enemies she can deal massive amounts of damage. Because of the bounces. Honestly dont rly get what you're complaining about.
---
If you have the same number if gems as the opponent, the countdown stops. That‚Äôs what they‚Äôre trying to do
---
It‚Äôs not a fair map because it‚Äôs not symmetrical
---
You can already see if someone has their super
---
Boy you get so triggered when you see someone teaming, probably you are not used to, but above 400 trophies on a brawler in every match there will be people teaming. Brawl Stars is about strategy, not skill. You can be the best player in the world, but if 2 or more people sandwitch you, you are dead. Stop getting triggered.
---
Nita would still be overpowered though, especially with star power.

Why is everybody making so bad maps

Just a word : The map's idea is to BE very chaotic, cuz in my opinion, this would lead to many options of approach and flanking :)

I team up but only against Leon.

Hey lad! Thanks for playing! We would like you to come back someday. This community is yours, feel free to talk and also play again!

Sorry, I don't know.

Ok i could not contact support and no ey has been dissapearing from my account when i did not buy it. Even when i disconnecter my credit card from my google play. Sooo
---
When is Carl releasing??
---
When people refund wasted bought gems, supercell will put you in debt.
---
9400 and still no legendaries
---
Sureee, I could not contact support and money has been dissapearing from my bank account even after I disconnected my credit card from my google play :( like u never know when it will take another 5‚Ç¨ away
---
BTW I bought some gems and packs and it is all in my buy history but the transactions that i did not buy are only in my sms from my bank like wtf
---
( it has been like 15‚Ç¨ in total I mean i have all sms from my bank saved so if u need proof)

i agree

Who has the lollipop? All i see is a piece of paper and a red lolipip

Are you doing anything to stop teaming and bushing?

We will be sprucing up the Shop at some point in the future, but it's a bigger task and will take some time.

Boo boo, you‚Äôre missing one brawler
---
Monthly balance changes like CR?
---
Hello Frank! What will you do with skins? Skins for el primo are no longer worth their gems, as well as Jesse, Barley. Mortis turned out very badly. Why don't you take concepts of skins from redita? Or do not change the designer?
---
What absolute nonsense, Mod please just remove this post 
---
Will Carl come next friday?
---
That's great to hear! I'm happy the Finnish cs scene is growing :)
---
Nah extra lives will make the game lasts too long. 
---
Have you ever teamed in solo showdown? Did it make you feel dirty if you did?
---
Haha, you can rest assured I've heard the song many times over before the major started itself, it's very upbeat!
---
When you can make optimization so much better on weak devices? Will you adding new modificators? New ticket's mode? And maybe delete Cavern Churn/Island Invasion?
---
Can you increase the possibilities of getting a legendary brawler, since it is very hard to get one.
---
You can say the word that will be associated with the next update
---
I don't know, basiccaly i went to SUPERCELL site and there were just most asked questions and only thing I found was to try refund the money but there were bot transactions on my account, just sms from my bank that brawlstars took money it was like 1,75 ‚Ç¨ and 4,50 or something like that right away, than 8,50 or something like that 3-4 days after the forts 2 tranzactions. 
---
Will the Throphy Road ever get changed? I've seen a lot of complaining about the end-game rewards (useless gold).

Any news on when theres gonna be voices for brawlers that dont have a VO yet? (I personally hope Spike cuz he's my only brawler :D )

Hello!
---
Would you like to have 50 different brawlers at one point in the game? 
---
How many do you think would be just right?
---
What plans do you have for clubs?
---
Will we be able to send messages to one friend any time soon?
---
Hello.

Q: are you guys working on any leagues system like clash royal? ( bronze. Silver gold) it's good for end game

And thank you!

When will you buff crow???

I‚Äôve seen this porn

Hey dev team!! You have any idea to late game problem with gold? At first its hard to get gold, but when ure get all brawlers with all her powepoints, the gold turn usefull (except for the new brawlers that will come)
---
U have any plam to use gold in late game? My ideas, special shop, buy skins for gold (2000 for skin that usually costs 80 gems) or buy battle pass with gold too, thx if u response!! 
---
Its rewind time
---
"Whoever plays the game the most is #1" isn't that how ranked works in this game...
---
lmao xD
---
1. Yeah, Gene got a massive buff in the last update... maybe it wasn't enough, but it seems he's pretty close to done now, we are still analyzing the results of his latest buff to see what else can we do about it. Regarding Crow... it's a tricky subject, with his speed and damage-over-time attacks a buff that might look small could have a great impact in the game. But we hear you and the team is aware of these feedbacks. Nothing concrete for now, but working on it!  
---
2. I think the reason is that the first updates after the global launch focused A LOT on polishing the game. So once we have a firm structure, we are free to create as much content as possible. We are still polishing some stuff though. :)
---
Beautiful 
---
Why offers cost more in euros than in dollars ?
---
Would you consider changing the price for Pheonix Crow to 150 gems and refunding the people who bought him? I think 300 is a bit extreme.
---
mock/mark?
---
I feel everyone knows they want something for clubs that would also elevate social aspect of the game - but they might not know what yet. 
---
I think I've an idea about "Club Championships" that I feel is gonna be fit for the game. Can you DM so I can compile and send that idea? 
---
Also do you think it's a good time to start a BS YT channel üëÄ
---
And Jessie not quite looking a child...
---
Lmao I had the same idea!

I wouldn't spend 100 coins for 50 coins
---
Are there any plans for an ‚ÄòSingle Player mode‚Äô down the line? My initial thought is making it like a dungeon crawler type where the progression system is similar to the pins system where when you finish levels you get pins for specific brawlers. 
---
Along the lines of game modes:
---
- 5v5
---
- Capture the flag
---
- Competitive mode (each team bans a brawler then drafts their team)
---
Love the work work you guys do ‚ù§Ô∏è

What‚Äôs gonna happen?Gang Bang
---
will make a nerfeo to shelly because I think many players have spent 11 to 14 loads and shelly arrives in l ...
---
I think Gem Grab is my favorite one because, in my opinion, is the most balanced mode. It's the one you can create a lot of different strategies using basically all the brawlers available.   
---
Now for the favorite map... I think Feast and Famine... I love the Chaos at the beginning of the match, haha. 
---
Are you guys working on a way to incentivize having 500+ trophy brawlers? If not, is this something that's on the priority list for the future update?

Will you add a casual mode ( no loosing trophies nor gaining.. just fun) ? Plsss

Happy Birthday btwüëª

Ive played it since march 2016, and i never remember it not being a thing until 2017.

Then how about making life leech available at 1k or 2k trophies

Yep! We have an internal channel dedicated to discuss new brawlers, so we have a lot of ideas already! Now we have to polish them and grab the ones that would fit the game. Many of player's suggestions end up on that channel as well. :) 
---
Any new brawlers coming to league rewards?
---
A nice bonus for us f2p players
---
Do you add Persian languageto the game?
---
First off, we as players would like to thank you for the recent updates and frequent communications from you guys, it's honestly refreshing to see such transparency from a game company of  your size. 
---
That being said, I still have some questions:
---
1) At its current state I feel that the club function is pretty barren, it serves zero functions other than to make friends easier. Are you guys planning to add more to clubs? I'd love to see something akin to the Clan Chest in CR, or even an entirely new mode like Club Wars. 
---
2) On the r/ClashRoyale subreddit there is a "developer update" every week or so from the dev team, about what they are planning to do and such. I think it's a good idea for you guys to do on this subbreddit too, we'd love to hear about what kind of content is coming. What do you guys think of this? 
---
3) Any plans to add new Trophy Road Brawlers/Skins? Currently the Trophy Road after 3k does not give that much incentives to push. 
---
Thank you for doing this AMA! 
---

Gedi_kor replied in another thread that sadly he doesn't have much experience in designing 3d as he is a 2d artist but is working to be up to that level someday.
---
O then I'm confused

What Ryan is saying is that some things in the files get released and some DON‚ÄôT

---
Will the OB‚Äôs be getting anything cool ??
---
Eclihpse made a video about one week ago...

Why?

I personally think it's a very fun idea! But to be honest it's not in our current plans. So if this happens at some point, will be far in the future. :O

Hot maze was my favourite map... yay
---
CR has like 100 or so cards and is way P2W, takes forever to max a card. For Brawl Stars, it‚Äôs very F2P dude. No need for CR like new brawler challenges
---
How many brawlers do you expect to see by the end of 2020
---
Sorry to hear that! It looks really weird indeed... Have you tried to contact our support team? [Click here if you haven't!](https://supercell.helpshift.com/a/brawl-stars/?p=web&amp;contact=1)

Hi, Guys from SC! I have 3 questions:
---
First, is it possible that community skins and brawler concepts can be considered to be included in game? If not, a lot of the serious content on this sub would be wasted. If that is possible, as a follow up, i believe that an annual contest of fan creation of brawler or skin concepts should should be held such that the winner gets to have his/her creation to be a real thing in-game. If this is possible, i am sure producers of this sub would create more and much better content.
---
Second, i have heard from multiple friends that there is going to be a thrower named Catcher to be released in the future. Is this true?
---
Third, can you please consider re-enabling SCID in China? I am not Chinese myself, as i have recently immigrated, but i do have a phone bought in China, and the button for SCID does not show. If it is to be replaced by another login method, like the chinese Wechat, then please change it back: Wechat can only hold one single account, but people can have multiple SCIDs. Please let me know if you can.
---
Hi im french sry for my english,
---
 are you going to change the rewards of rank and season because at high level they become useless!
---
if you're asking about the numbers, it's all in Stats
---
No. I'm from a self-made club
---
Since he can't make 3D models supercell should use his 2D models to make skins. His skin ideas are still better than what supercell is coming up with (looking at you night witch mortis)
---
Yea I gave them way too much credit and respect. They're pretty dumb just read the reviews and ratings in thr store. 
---
Create an organizational system for the friends list so I can see my irl friends vs people I‚Äôve played with a couple times 
---
Hi supercell I have a idea for a better star power for crow! When he git one he become more health, ror example crow have 3340 health he become 3350 he become 10 health too with his poison! That mean he become pro hit 50 health more! in the end of a game he have not 3340 rather 4000! Thanks for reading 
---
You don't have problem with that because you never faced a 6 brawlers team. Where you have no hope of winning trophies.
---
Have you guys ever considered putting in a post-game stats summary? Even the bare minimum like kills, deaths, and total damage would be a huge help, as well as mode-specific info like damage delivered to the heist safe, boss robots, and so-on. I play side-by-side with my girlfriend and we often debate who contributed more (or less üòÇ) to a match, and it would be so nice to have some stats to back up our claims! It would also make it easier to decide whether to stay on playing with the same randomly matched teammate(s), and would give players something to feel good about at those times when they barely lose a close match even though they've performed well.
---
If it's something you've considered putting in the game but decided against for some reason, why is that?
---
1. Are there any plans for adding extra Star Powers to each character (still you have to choose one) so it changes the way is played?
---
2. It be good to have something to achieve with the clan, is there any plans for this?
---
Are the updates going to keep coming once a month or be like any other SC game?
---
Ah the colour of gems
---
Then check the sub more often, gedi kor has only posted like 8 skins, there‚Äôs tons of people that have posted way more than him 
---
I think that is too much
---
what if u instead made showdown 1st place give 5 and 10th take 5 trophies,because this is a main reason people team,they can't push they are stuck and they have to relay on others, punish players less for losing showdown also maybe add 1v1 gamemode for all like gem grab 1v1 and stuff like that because good amount of people play showdown because they want to avoid random noobs
---
Oh I‚Äôm so sorry that I don‚Äôt fucking follow everything regarding this game on social media. 
---
I have some brawler ideas in my posts, can you check them?
---
A situational Brawler but quite good on the right hands! What about you, how do you see her in the current meta?
---
What will you do about late game content? Improved trophy road?

I think it‚Äôs very immature to label optional cosmetics that fans of the game want to buy as ‚Äúmoney hungry‚Äù. Did you know that Supercell pays its employees to make this incredible game for us?
---
Not at this exact moment, but it's one item we want to revisit and discuss again. It's already on our list! :)
---
üëÄ
---
Why the box is no longer a store
---
The modifier that really fixed teaming was Life Leech. Why don't you make Life Leech available again in 300+ Brawlers as a permanent thing to remove teaming?
---
This is so cooool
---
I want this goalkeeper on my team.

I hope this is satire lmao

Do not add Persian language for Iranian gamers?
---
My only problem with braw stars is in showdown. I hate killing one teammate for the other to spawn right on his partner and completely destroy my health, because he has a shield bubble to protect him for 3 seconds.
---
Is there any way that you guys could make to were if you shoot while in your shield it disappears?
---
Why did you change Ricochet skin? I‚Äôm asking for a friend

This is *AWSOME*

If I offer a skin on Tara, you think about what would it add to the Game?

I have issues with firing my Supers still. I try and use it but it auto attacks instead which gets me killed sometimes. I'm on a S9+ is it just my phone or is this a known problem that will be resolved in the future?

Dear Supercell, what are your thoughts on eSports? The scene is still young, but es time goes in, more People will want to be competitive.
---
Will there be any big Events/tournaments hosted by Supercell? Let me know what your thoughts are &amp; btw you guys rock! 
---
Thanks :)
---
Its a joke because everybody in this sub is talking about him.
---
Im saying that the teaming is so bad rn, the Shelly could kill that Primo in a second she even had her super...
---
Will there be more Solo playing content in the game, if yes then when? If no then why? In my opinion, BS really needs to be a game that ppl don't always need good partners to play with. Playing with randoms literally means a 50% win and loss rate most of the times. 
---
What if his ult make him invisible for ~ 4 seconds and left a substitution at his position? Thus, allowing him to reposition.
---
you went afk
---
mortis gang here, could we expect some kind of mortis buff?  He's pretty good now, but he could be better in the current meta, such as a buff to his dash range or reload speed.
---
Will the old lobby music ever be returning? Personally I liked it a lot more than the current lobby music.
---
probably Bo Remodel 
---
Thanks for being an OB and for hanging in there! It was a wild ride. :)
---
Since jump pads are a new element in the game, we wanted to start slowly. I believe we are going to see many maps with jump pads in the future - I saw some really cool SD maps with little islands around here somewhere. Yep, pretty excited about this. ;)
---
how does that relate to the persian language you want to see in the game?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Tara also doesn‚Äôt have a remodel... kinda pointless to give her a skin 
---
Who's all of your fantastic voice actors? I didn't see them credited in the credits...
---
I really like playing her, but I have to admit that she is good in like 2 bounty maps and maybe one gem grab map only. I'd like to see (and use) her more often in the game! 
---
What aspect of Darryl makes him viable for his health of 4000, instead of the normal heavyweight health, which is 5800?

Is there a Brawl Stars API, like Clash Royale one?

Dam that‚Äôs sad when will we get new skins

I love siege.
---
Are we going to get an official API any time soon? Also an official fan kit for the art and assets?
---
First of all, thanks for all the effort ur making and the game is growing fast.. tho im a little bit disappointed that ur adding brawlers but not balancing the rate of unlocking a new brawlers.. its been 9 months since i downloaded the game.. no legendaries and no gene..I even doubt getting carl the super rare brawlers.. maxed out every brawler i have (not in level, but i dont get anything from brawl boxes) 
---
Q: is it because i have 3 star powers i got from boxes??.. or is it just soooo unlucky.. either way this is soo unfair and really bores me so much.. all my brawlers are 400+trophies total of 8600s trophies..

I‚Äô ve been playing BS since the Beta Launch in Canada, and lately, I haven‚Äôt had any reason to be playing this game, what I mean by this is that the End - Game is just too repetitive, it‚Äôs all about getting the daily Tokens and Star Tokens, getting a few tropheys, and losing half of them after 2 weeks: Are you planning to add more End - Game content for players like me?
---
Great skin
---
What is the creative process of making a new addition to the game (brawlers, game modes) and do you take in the feedback from the community
---
also thanks for the meme templates
---
What do you think about a "Crazy Mode"?
---
4 vs 4, but with boosted brawlers.
---
Players will start with a bonus like: Super at every 5-10 seconds, x2 fire loading, 30% speed, x3 Hp .... Can be a mini event :-s
---
Do you ever plan on improving the trophy road rewards at higher trophies? It is rather sad to push 300 trophies to get a normal brawl box at 6300.
---
And on the topic of brawl boxes...Do you have plans for new brawl boxes or perhaps improving the current boxes? Example: Make Big boxes be like 5 normal boxes, make Mega boxes be like 15.
---
When leon will have skins
---
Is there ever going to be a new trophy road
---
Will you nerf leon and also will you add special events to friendly game like big game boss fight and robo rumble?
---
Are you going to rework Penney's star power ?
---
Just wanted to start out by saying thank you for all the awesome content in Brawl Stars! So much hard work goes into this game, and I hope the community realizes it!
---
Will there possibly be any more major UI revamps to Brawl Stars? There were quite a few in soft launch days. 
---
About how much longer do you expect until replays will be available to all brawler trophy ranges? We know you‚Äôre hard at work prepping the servers!
---
On robo rumble, there‚Äôs the occasional exploit found by the community. Does Supercell test for exploits, or just leave it to the community? ;)
---
About how far out have you planned the future of Brawl Stars? Months, years?
---
We hope you always keep an open ear to the community! Thanks again.   :)
---
Are you guys considering giving tara (and all the other brawlers without va aswell) a voice actress anytime soon?

Can you please give me a brawler? üòâ

Why you don t give me a legendary? I don t have a legendary browler.  My name is CD JACK 15Q In browl stars
---
Will you put inside the game a 1vs1 mode with special maps and fight with the same brawlers both opponents.
---
Are you working on other ways to unlock skins other than by purchasing them? 
---
you know new event gives you 2 times more trophies
---
DANG!!! SON!!!!
---
1)Do you have plans on making siege a permanent event?
---
2) Will you be adding settings for friendly games?
---
^
---
By that I mean allow duplicate brawlers,remove bots button for example
---
Need brawl war mode...üòÅ
---
Is life leach going to come back
---
Sorry, I don‚Äôt speak German.
---
Will there be a name change for gems option in the near future?
---
Do you think you'll ever bring back the old descriptions? Maybe even expand on the small bits of lore we have currently?
---
Are you gonna make the brawlers more easy to get cause they are too hard to get and the power point cost a lot 
---
Yep! Jumpei is moving to a different project now! :)
---
In your opinion, how much would this skin cost? for me it would be worth 150 gems or more, it's really cool.
---
Will you add new features to friendly matches like where there are no bots, or no star powers, or no balancing, or the showdown mods as an option to turn on or off? I would really like this feature to be added but there‚Äôs no rush!
---
Gedi kor make a chicken crow, why not? XD
---
Epic 
---
Buff gene is is very bad he need a bit of damage bosst he needs to do a bit of damage with super i guess 10% increase in damage and 200 hp damage with super
---
Why do we have to get a brawler to 400 trophies to unlock replays? Do you plan on changing this?
---
Can you please put crow in shop ive been waiting for him in shop for months i bought 950 gemsüò≠
---
Any plan on relocating the Exit button while searching for a match?
---
Currently, PLAY button and EXIT button are located on the same point (left down of the screen), so it‚Äôs sometimes annoying when you double tap and the search get canceled right away

A spy from Brawl Stars did it in secret so BS could be special &gt;:)

Did think abaut a score board in the end of the brawl
---
I am rly want to see how much kills, deaths and assists to compare with my friends
---
Are you thinking about doing smth against teaming?
---
Why won‚Äôt you guys add more competitive elements to have this game compete with other popular moba styled games? 
---
Deff one of my favorite skins love how you keep him looking like frank while at the same time being the royale king üòäüíô
---
Is there going to be an in game map editor in the future?
---
Will you hire u/GEDI-KOR? He makes amazing brawl stars art and said he was interested if you were interested
---
OH and can we have a skeleton themed brawler sometime soon? (not poco, just one that can have a bomber from clash royale skin please)
---
Will you rework Night Witch Mortis? Will you nerf Spike? What's up with the Replay feature, that you can only get with 400 brawler trophies? How are you gonna improve randoms, like voice chat, or select certant brawlers you wanna play with, and it will filter it that way? When is Carl out, with a more specific date? Are the updates gonna be as frequent, as they were with the Gene and Carl update? When are there gonna be 5v5, 2v2 and 1v1 gamemodes? How do you plan on stopping teaming, because i have a suggestion with a free for all Bounty sort of gamemode. Is Life Leech gonna be back, because it's by far the best event mod. Damn, that's a hell lot of questions. Hope, you answer them all.
---
A Brawl Stars Addict
---
Why is Brawl Stars not a western related game anymore now it‚Äôs like from genies to birds and people wearing costumes and going invisible!
---
Thank you I was trying to go for something like that haha
---
What are the top five things on your priority list for future updates?
---
tell death i admire him/her
---
Can you report players who intentionally mess up your game on your team (example I had a bull on my team for brawl ball who purposely ran the ball into our goal making it impossible to win causing loss of trophies)
---
Will there be a in game community which allows all players to create maps and play on it.Just like steam community.
---
Is there gonna be a voice chat feature that will allow you to speak with your random teammates to organize what you are gonna pick before the match starts or atleast something similiar with a text chat atleast?
---
ƒ∞t is very perfect
---
m a s t e r p i e c e xD &lt;3
---
because they do not put more information about the battles, for example: how many kills were made, how many deaths, who did more damage, number of ultimates thrown etc, and also the range of objects such as the jessie tower, put a white circle as in royal clash that shows its range of scope
---
When will be Carl ??
---
"Change Night Witch Mortis" button
---
They cut the screen on some devices where the screen is bigger so they don‚Äôt have a viewpoint disadvantage to those on a smaller device.
---
Maybe change his coat color to red for a more tropical-bird-y color?
---
Hey I really hope you see this because I ABSOLUTELY LOVE this game but the controls ruin it if I run into a bush with a block behind it I‚Äôll just start going around it maybe make an option so wherever your joystick is aimed that‚Äôs the direction your brawler will go. No helping so I don‚Äôt run straight into the wall. If I pull my joystick to the right I want to go right even if there is a wall there not up or down to go around the wall also maybe prioritize other brawlers&gt;boxes with auto aim just some movement fixes and it would make this game even better for me
---
If your actually reading all this thank you very much for your time and happy brawling:)
---
Now sd hv modifiers to prevent teaming , but can u remove modifiers in duo showdown , the showdown with modifiers is really luck based and no skill 
---
How long does it take you to make all your amazing skins? I think you put more work in your skin ideas then supercell does.
---
Thank you! üôè
---
Can you make so we can see the chance drop rate on normal brawl boxes
---
Can we get the old home screen music back? Or maybe as an option? I remember booting up the game multiple time as the beginning sound following to the music was soooo smooth and nice, the old song is just soo much hype!!
---
i use the photoshop :)
---
Sometimes it does sometimes it don't 
---
ok,this is epic
---
As a top player, trophy pushing gets kind of boring. Is there any hope for say challenges like clash Royale? Or maybe even a club chest like Royale? Just something other than trophy pushing.
---
Can white crow get a remodel? I think IT does not worth 80 gems, since it's just recolored.....
---
Why was the wall in front of heist maps Removed
---
Agreed üòÇüö¨
---
oh that's so cool
---
It was a great mode please try to make it come back somehow
---
When are you going to buff crow?
---
How would this work on bush filled maps, such as Feast and Famine, where all the Bulls and Shellys are hiding but are just standing there waiting for some poor Crow to walk into their corner? It isnt like the Bulls and Shellys are teaming, that just happens to be their M.O. 
---
Taking damage like that would just give away someone's position. It's like playing hide and seek but you're shouting "COLD, COLD, WARMER, WARMER, WARMER, HOT HOT HOT!" while you're trying to hide.

What if it was within a certain period of time so like 20-30 seconds of not touching the enemy would make it not your damage anymore
---
What's lore?(sorry,i've been playing for less than 3 months and i'm not up to date with everythingüòÖ)

Any new remodels coming any time soon *cough* bow *cough* Also, buff crow?

Are there higher dropchances on power points which are a lesser rarity?
---
Contract Gedi-Kor
---
Plans for Crow? Real shame he was my first legendary and honestly id rather have tara or mortis...
---
Buff crow? 
---
Crow buff please? Been playing since early beta nearly everyday and only crow to show for it out of the legendaries - but crow feels very underwhelming at the moment. His hp is very low, as well as his damage. He could do with a rework maybe of his main attack - for example less spread on his daggers, or a super rework which doesn't require him to be up close to be at all effective.
---
Would like to hear your guys' thoughts on balance regarding crow :)
---
Normal Showdown should have a fixed button, just like gem grab. And for event modifiers should be enable another button on the game mode selection.
---
How can u get this Mortis behind your name? 
---
later? cmoooon
---
hello I would like to know if when they put seasonal skins such as Christmas or Chinese New Year could be proquridas without having the brawler to which correresponda since in my case I have no legendary brawler and for example if they removed a skin season lion, crow or spike I would like to buy it even if at that time I do not have the brawler because I like to buy such skins for the fact of being for a limited time
---
Will there be more than 4 daily game modes at the same time? Thanks
---
Any thoughts on adding a 3-person showdown or adding a 4th spot on the squad for specific game modes? Also, any ideas on how to fix teaming in showdown?
---
Will the trophy road rewards ever improve?
---
Well I do not have a question I have a proposal:
---
I have the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating a gigantic showdonw map in which 100 or 50 players can be so the teams are eliminated a bit
---
-In a corner you would have a small map to know your location
---
-The last one that survives would have a reward neither too big nor too small
---
-And a small reward to anyone who has done more kills
---
-Maybe the mode would not be available almost always would be a weekend event which you would enter with tickets
---
-And the tab that would be left where the current showdonw could be used to include a new game mode
---
-Anyway that was my idea I hope you see it and analyze it :)üòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅ
---
I really love your game and the great work and effort you put into this beauty! But there is one thing i would want. Reduced loosing trophies. The game somethimes looses players because they get angry due to a loosing streak. (I get angry somethimes but would never delete the game) It would make the game a bit more fun and enjoyable to play with friends or alone. 
---
#Will an in-game report feature be added?
---
Wow ce faci? 
---
Will the level packs ever reappear in the shop? The Leon update was before global, so I did not have the right apple ID with the right currency so I missed out on the first two packs. Please let them cycle when there are no other options in the shop. Thank you!
---
Are you gonna buff crow... if not why?!
---
Will you guys ever add a 1 trophy per kill system? From what I‚Äôve read it seems like a half decent way to stop teaming 
---
Hello, Good morning. I wanted to continue supporting the game mode 5 against 5 is very interesting and fun to get more out of the game thanks. 
---
And by the way would be good the bane to do team because you can hardly see any game of survival in just that there is some kind of alliance... That's all thank you very much. 
---
Couldn‚Äôt you just base it off damage with a max setting. If someone is stealing kills but only did a total of 1000 damage then it would be there survival rating plus there total damage output. If they die first and lose 6 trophies but did 8000 damage total it would be a max of 6 trophies minus 6 to get a zero rating. Sounds like a headache just thinking about it but none the less I sense the pain of dealing with that issue
---
Not much lol, just gonna play some Bull Pen tonight. I got a good comp and allies, made Cbass quit off his 850 piper from the map ü§£. Fees good to beat someone who is clearly a much better player than I am, twice.

Hello team of brawl stars I hope the game continues to move in the way that follows my question is going to have a battel Pass in Brawl Stars this idea is very good I am very much called as I am a graphic designer I am interested in skins for brawl and if you can create new characters I'm very interested in this idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe batel pass I have many ideas to put them to the brawl Thank you very much guys look after;) 
---
Why did you change the colors of people's names?
---
Contact supercell support
---
Oh got it, sry

Not a photoshop app- just drawing app :) iBis Paint X

I think the nerf to leon is a bit too much ,he's an assassin, and nerfing he's damage would be the worst way to adjust his position in this game ,what kind of assassin is that if he can't one shot anybody?? To my opinion the better change to leon is nerfing his range not damage ,because it's not right to have that much range on an assassin ,by nerfing his range he will have his strengths but not too overpowered and also counterable .(the win rate on leon is abysmal right now.)

Colored* cheerios
---
With Carl having the highest possible dps, would you consider a delay before another tick of damage when he bounces his pickaxe off a wall?
---
can you guys bring back the earlier attack animations of valentine's Poco?I mean that attack animations were too beautiful and good...now it's a bit girlish typeüòú
---
Are there plans on adding a new button to the menu? Something like "Create map" I'd like to create new maps to gem grab,showdown and stuffs like that. 
---
And then you could upload your map and the community could download.
---
Thanks for all ‚ù§
---
Viva M√©xico! üòÅ

I have been playing this game since June 2017 and I love it! Also I have two questions: 
---
1.Q: Do you accept ideas for new brawlers? (If yes, I would have one)
---
2.Q: Are you still improving and working on seige?
---
Hi! Do you guys planning an battle pass or something like that? I remember that in the survey there was a guestion,, would you like to see battle pass in brawl stars? To unlock exclusive skins boost etc". 
---
Why do you start with two stars on bounty it‚Äôs so annoying personally like you spawn and you randomly get convicted with a murder why supercells 
---
This will be the best skin in Brawl Stars
---
Okay so why can you only replay matches over 400 trophies for the brawler you played???
---
A feature that lets you rewatch your matches and get better seems more important EARLY in the game!
---
There was no limitation like this for Clash Royale so I don't understand why I can't just watch my matches until I reach a pretty high level. 
---
Love the game, favorite Supercell game so far, this is my only "issue"...
---
That and matchmaking sometimes lol
---
When they are going to have Pam's skin?:(
---
Any chance there will be a 5v5 mode that will be a lot of fun
---
Wham, bam, here comes Pam! 
---
Thanks Sart! :)
---
Pretty goddamn late
---
Will there be a rework of big boxes? 10 keys (2,5days) for 1 big box, that is equivalent to 3 small is not enough. Thanks
---
I am thinking about an option to drop diamonds (or whatever kind of items) to give the game a little strategic touch. It would also be fun to see some improvements on communicate options  between you and your teammates while in a game. 
---
P.S. : I love these Ama's  :)
---
Any thoughts on making old models of certain brawlers who had massive remodels (Ex: Mortis, Dynamike, Rico) as skins for people who played with those models?
---
Are you working on skins for brawlers like Pam and Tara??
---
Don‚Äôt forget the stunned brawlers‚Äô super indicator that blinks vigorously.  
---
r/Brawlmaps
---
True haha, my bad on that
---
Is piper getting any changes soon? I feel like she could use some help.
---
Thank you!!! Right back at ya! :D
---
Yeah it takes me a couple weeks to max a brawler because I actively try to just spend gold on it and buy the star power instead of wasting boxes which are a precious commodity. I‚Äôve managed to get down from like 20k to 10k but that fool buying leon and gene with gems and pulling spike
---
Chetad a Crow, haced algo con las personas que hacen equipo y m√°s modos de juego por favor. Gracias&lt;3
---
¬øPueden poner un boton para seleccionar eventos en las partidas amistosas?
---
Don‚Äôt forget the cuffs
---
I have seen a player that has Brock at 29 trophies. Can you explain me how this is possibile?
---
Gedy cor makes a skin of Frank Hulk holding a tank of war by the cannon
---
When is Carl released?
---
Will there be background stories for the characters cause i think itll be interesting, also thank you for your hardwork and wonderfull game
---
I hope you like it!
---
Crow gang approves
---
I don't think that because primo dont have a gun and the bull and RG does.
---
Bana neden 1 aydƒ±r hi√ß hero √ßƒ±kmƒ±yor anlamadƒ±m √∂b√ºr oyunculara 4 yada 5 g√ºnde bir hero geliyor bana hi√ß gelmiyor oyunda adaletsizlik var √ßok kutu a√ßmama raƒümen hero gelmiyor adaletsiz bir oyun bu Oyun nick im Yasin L√ºtf√º artƒ±k bir hero verin ya adaletsizlik yapiyosunuz
---
I can see this one being added to the game. This is AWESOME!!
---
How much more probabilities there are to get a legendary brawler when you have all the brawlers except the legendaries (by the way i don't speak english very well so I'm sorry write something)
---
(o\_o)
---
Why i have 3000 trophies and mt friend have same trophies and i don't have any Epic,Mithic,Legendary brawler?
---
My friend have Frank,Piper and Crow
---
Happy Spike Day!
---
It's real good.
---
Fix the solo experience already
---
Any Jessie skins coming out soon?
---
When will a Leon skin come out?
---
Get his star power first. Then you may commence.
---
one thing and if to eliminate the team because they do not do that when two or more players are 2 or fewer squares away without attacking they begin to suffer damage until they separate and so when the poison is closed closing they attack or die
---
This is just stupid
---
WHERES CARL!!!!
---
Hey BrawlStars team, can you check out some of my brawler ideas on my profile?üòÑ
---
Ahah you‚Äôre funny. I like you
---
I have an idea so that there are no more teams in showdawn, is that in this game mode is that the Brawlers can not turn or meteorite always fall as that would prevent there are teams and can not be together
---
Please add skin for spike
---
Since there is duo showdown and we know multi team game modes are doable, are there more down the line soon? I feel like a keep away mode or something with 3 teams could be really interesting. Also how are you guys gonna make the menu work going forward with new game modes? Will there be too many to just have them rotate?
---
1. What about clubs? I want to know what are you going to do with these clubs, maybe some HUGE club events and rewards for taking a part in them? 
---
2. I interested in few thibgs about Siege: How soon new maps will be added? And i want to know ‚Äî are you going to make Siege time a bit longer in time ( i'm talking about the whole match), i asking that, because reward is doubled and the whole time isn't.
---
3. Please, BUFF CROW!
---
Whta will be the next brawler after Carl? 
---
r/itsnot
---
When it will be add the battle pass ?
---
Now that‚Äôs hot
---
Last month was February.
---
they should have gone for this instead of that worse mortis skin .
---
Hola buenas tardes, en mi cuenta de brawl stars (√óPUNISHER√ó98) tengo 5837 y soy nivel 69 , queria consultar si en algun momento va a seguir saliendo la oferta en la tienda para comprar a Leon, ya que queria comprar gemas para poder comprarlo, espero que puedan responderme lo antes posible, muchas gracias.
---
*EL CUERVO*
---
Contact them, not me
---
Will you ever buff Mortis or Crow?
---
Happy cake day.  Wanna eat my cake üéÇ?
---
Holly Jesus! 
---
You should make a new game mode where everyone plays with the same brawler
---
Me gustar√≠a que se pudiera poner las skins que quisieras en los amistosos
---
When leon or spike are gonna get a voice?
---
What did you use to make this?
---
Hello, Am I able to know when the next legendary offer will drop on the shop? I have been waiting for a while I want Leon 
---
Are to going to do something about the teaming in solo showdown?
---
Always was, always will. Also I'm pretty sure it's "trans neutral" now mhmmmmmm tee her, (nice legs n a pair o bawlz) 
---
Hello
---
Love it so much! I love this movie &lt;3
---
Did anyone order a large Tailspin pizza?
---
Nerf shely buff crow
---
Since the new matchmaking I can't play with my friends with lower trophies because we battle against teams way stronger than us. Please make a new matchmaking system or rework this new one. Thanks ‚úåÔ∏èüëç
---
Glad to have you on the team for my favorite game! You seem like a very genuine dude that wishes the best for all sides!
---
WTF?! 
---
well they may inspire a better idea from that they always come with the best things
---
# Colt be like skrrrrrrrrreeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee.
---
They say she ain't nothing but a gold digger... 
---
What a mad lad 
---
is it viable to ask if there are differences in the chances of getting a new brawler even if there are obviously none? 
---
Premise 1: Low skill cap strategies require less skill by definition. 
---
Premise 2: Teaming is a low skill cap strategy. 
---
Premise 3: From 1 and 2; Teaming takes less skill than higher skill cap strategies. 
---
Premise 4: High skill cap strategies encourage players to become more skilled, whereas low skill cap strategies do not.
---
Premise 5: From 4; players who habitually use low kill cap strategies are likely to be less skilled.
---
Premise 6: It's possible to earn high amounts of trophies with low skill cap strategies. 
---
Premise 7: Low skilled players are synonymous with bad randoms.
---
Premise 8: If a player who teams plays in other game modes they're likely to play along side players who either also team, do not team or quit playing Showdown because of teaming.
---
Conclusion: Teaming does not encourage players to become more skilled by it's very nature and is a low skill cap strategy which means that teamers are low skilled players. It is therefore likely that low skilled players are playing in other game modes. The incentive is to earn the star token. It follows thus that if Teamers are low skilled players then they are bad randoms.
---
Put another way; whatever trophy level you started twaming at was where your skill level plateaued. But you kept gaining trophies because you found a way to exploit the game (which is just a polite way of saying you cheated). So if you started teaming at 300 trophies and your brawlers are at 400 trophies, then when you go into other game modes you're playing with other people who are at 400 trophies. Players who are likely to be players who don't team, quit Showdown because of teaming are also more likely to be more skilled. Basically you're a 300 trophy player (or whatever level you started teaming at) trying to compete alongside and against 400 trophy players. Plain and simple, you're just not as good as they are. 
---
Wait, is Carl out on IOS?!
---
Can you make me a gift because yesterday was my birthday
---
Are u doing trio or squad showdown... I should like showdown 5v5
---
stop youll get the furries excited
---
Hey guys I am looking forward to join a team in brawl stars . So if anyone needs a team mate plz do tell me 
---
In my opinion you should be able to start even with only one player, to allow exploring the map and testing stuff out.
---
Not bad
---
XDDDDD Bull has a beautiful legs.
---
Are you thinking about a crow buff? I know a lot of people asked but i think for a legendary he's pretty weak. He can be used very well but in use (i have him and spike) he is useless in a lot situations, against that spike and leon is very strong, but crow doesn't get a chance next to them
---
It is Mr. Spike üåµ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Because my clan is inactive.
---
they won‚Äôt leave it like that! i mean if he will get a remodel we should take an opportunity to purchase it with a lower price
---
I upvoted 3 times. I still want to do it more!!!
---
whats's up with the servers?
---
I'm From dominican Republic and I always get the bad conection icon even when I play using 100mbps
---
Well, I opened up a Mega box, 2 Big Boxes and 15 Brawl Boxes and I got nothing out of them and my legendary rate only went up by 0.05%. I'm very proud of this accomplishment! (i should get an achievement for "worst luck ever").
---
Some games such as Mobile Legends, Vainglory and other MOBA style games have these emote in game indicators to show if a teammate needs assistance or to show caution in an area or to gather for a team fight, etc. They also have a symbol on each character's profile/image to show if they are marksman, assassin, tank and so on. I agree that often times I want to be like "No, teammate don't go over there, we need to all be over here." Or very away from each other because of Jessie. Lol. I know they want the games to be fast and simple, but, I could see some form of a system such as this being effective for those who don't or can't use voice chat and also if we are in a place where connecting and communicating over chat isn't an option, it could help maintain quality of play for teams and "Randoms." 
---
Just thought I'd add to this instead of making an additional post since someone already brought it up. Cause you know. I like to help and stuff. üòä
---
Hahaha, soon in android 
---
That's amazing dude
---
is that you kuxir?
---
What do you guys think about of kill/death ratio in the screen in the end of the match? Also damage done/ damage receive;  healing done; goals scored/gems grabed/safe damage done/ stars grabed/IKE damage done/bolts collect.... something like that. So we can see our performance and the performance of ours teamates....
---
It's no magic solution, but I hope [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/axx3ta/suggestions_to_eliminatemitigate_the_impact_of/) helps you to generate some ideas to curb teaming somewhat, whilst maintaining the tactical and psychological aspects of it. 
---
Because I do not even touch a legendary, I have been playing and raising drinks for a while and I do not even touch one :(
---
I must be Frank, your majesty
---
hi  will   crow   get  a  buff ?
---
When are you guys gonna give a crow a REAL buff?
---
Any advice for me? F2P on 4700 trophies, with mortis, tara, piper and all super rares. 
---
OwO what's this?
---
Are you going to add missions that will reward like coins and maybe gems or power points
---
Is there gonna be a new rarity in the future?
---
If yes it should be uncommon
---
When will we be able to have skins for piper,pam and Leon???
---
Is Leon ever getting a skin? 
---
Hello bs team and welcome dani 
---
1. 
---
How do you decide what rarity a brawler is is it how good they are how unique or something else
---
2.
---
Are there plans for more gamemodes since the addition of siege was really refreshing and fun even more so then a new brawler also i really like how all youre gamemodes are unique and not the same as other games
---
Have a good day bs team!! 
---
To fix the showdown problem I have two ideas, 
---
1.- No more than two players with the same brawler in the same match. This can fix the Dynamike, Barley, etc. teaming.
---
2.- If the game detects that you aren't damaging an enemy in 24 seconds (or the time you want to set) you will start losing health with an effect, for example the poison effect of crow. You can display in the info of the showdown mode, that you will lose health if you don't damage someone in 24 seconds.
---
Suggestions: 
---
1vs1 and 2vs2 gamemodes. 
---
The option to play gem grab mode in 1vs1 (I have a post with the full suggestion in my profile).
---
Better trophy rewards.
---
Battle Pass.
---
Add more skins of brawlers for 30 gems (That's one of the reasons why I play Brawl Stars).
---
New ranks for brawlers above 500+ trophies.
---
End season new rewards: gems and gold.
---
Fix the effect when you rank up a brawler. (The shiny effect that appears in the medal, I think the effect should not be shown outside the medal).
---
The option to select a profile picture if you unlocked a brawler skin, for example: I can select Spike profile picture, but I want to select the Spike Sakura profile picture because I unlocked the skin.
---
Make the spanish language more global, Im from M√©xico, not from Spain. (I can help to translate the language).
---
And that's all for now.
---
Crow the Chad 
---
o-o
---
What is the team's current view on Showdown teaming and are there any plans of additional features that'll encourage and reward a more skill-based play style? (Bonuses for kills and achieving first place).
---
What do the Spanish words mean that El primo says ??
---
Thank you üòÅ
---
Where my legendary,mythic and epic Brawlers?
---
my trophy 2100+
---
First I have the worst luck and I have spent money on game anyway what week will the update drop
---
You‚Äôre just too good
---
I bet if Carl is underwhelming a decent buff would be that he can break walls with his super. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair to say supercell copied it exactly, they may have had a similar idea independently, but either way do you have the link?
---
nice little update
---
Personal questions 
---
Like someone else said why not add a backstory for the brawlers? 
---
How old are the characters?
---
And how many characters are you planing to add this year?
---
Are you going to add microphone so we can talk to our team?
---
Loaded for sure
---
In Layman's terms: focus on collecting screws, not throwing yourself at the enemy base
---
Also, no offence, but that's just being a little slow, not because it's new
---
Popcorn's gun looks danky
---
This picture makes me feel an emotion that doesn't exist.
---
It would be better if its small crow, but topless and he's got a six pack
---
Will you ever remove the Brawl Ball shot ammo consumtion? Mortis WAS one of the most enjoyable brawlers to use in this game mode. Now I just find myself avoiding the ball as much a possible and going for kills..
---
Since Gene was released in mid-February and now we are getting Carl after almost a month after Gene's release...so can we assume that we'll get a new brawler every 1month/1.5month ?
---
Scam
---
A solution to calm down the team in showdown could be to avoid that brawlers can be repeated in the same map because it is almost always the dynamike and the barley that ruin the game.
---
What are you going to do to make game more F2P yeah i know BS is most F2P game of supercell but still its hard AF to get legendary brawlers
---
Hello, dear developers of BRAWL STARS, I would like to say "YOU"
---
Why don't I get new bravlers ... for example, new players on 500 + -600 + cups Leon, Raven, Spike and other cool bravlers are falling, but nothing drops on 2k500! Please give me at least one new bravler I can‚Äôt raise cups with 10 bravlers, and you know why, but because it is impossible from my point of view!
---
Can you guys add a trading system in brawlstars like you have in other supercell games through the clubs. So we can possibly trade power points, gold, tokens, tickets, etc.
---
Hello supercell,we are going to have some new attacks for brawlers soon? something like more stronger attack but it cost two bars and its easier to avoid
---
Is there a "theme" for Brawl Stars?
---
Because the repetition is four hundred glasses there are other people who do not have these glasses and want to see their repetions can not go down to a hundred glasses
---
Of a gay! L o L guys like, so what if a gay sorry English not good but L o L mortis a gay but so? Xiaoxoxo oxo.. Xiao xiao aoaoo. Funny  L o L
---
What are u trying to know about this???
---
I can try
---
Can my ideas join this channel aswell?

---
Thank you for choosing crow
---
Holy moly yes
---
I'm confused
---
Why the levels of the brawlers are so different? 
---
Are you planing on adding club box or daily rewards? This will make clubs awesome! Keep going forward and good luck! 
---
Would you guys ever consider bringing back the old crests as kill icons whenever you kill someone?
---
Which Brawler was the hardest to design, make, and plan?
---
The heck! 
---
Do you think on a power points donations system?
---
Welcome to the gang of docking club
---
Hi Supercell, with regard to the topic of the team, my idea would be to put a button to report a player of the game when finished, so you can report to one or two players, either by team, by hacker, etc. Then, it would be necessary to review the repetition, if they consider that the report is true, they prevent you from playing the event until it ends (or another punishment that you want) and thus eliminate all kinds of discomfort. If the true report is not considered, give some punishment to the one that I report to another player, thus avoiding false reports. Thank you very much for reading and hopefully you can fix this problem.
---
When is Brawl Stars dropping on the Switch. And if not, why not? The paltform would fit perfectly for the game.
---
Thank you!
---
I know your pain, i waited for one month to get 2 brawlers... And now 17/18 is rank 20, i think i cant have fun anymore
---
What's your opinion about the Siege exploit....will you guys fix it or leave it as it is???
---
Will you buff crow?
---
A brawler who could create a wall would be overpowered for sure cause you could completely block off your retreat and make it impossible to follow you without a wall breaker, but a highhealth obstacle could maybe work.. I feel like Pam is very similar to this brawler‚Äôs role in the game tho
---
More skins for the third year of clash royale
---
100%. The inclusion of landscape and auto aim addition soured my taste and made me quit for months, but they improved on it. Definitely great developers that are interested in the longevity of the game.
---
put a button to report to the user that makes a team and create a section where the repetitions are seen and that the people bounce if they are doing team or not, something like the hackers report in CSGO.
---
In april,the next brawler can be Mr.Handy?
---
Permanent Life Leech wouldn't be fun if you want to play solo normally. What if there was a 6th slot for only Life Leech?
---
I have a few questions that have been on my mind:
---
1) Have you ever thought about adding a 1v1duel game mode? A lot of the community thinks it is an interesting concept.
---
1.5) If you have, do you think of it as an alternative to solo showdown so that people who really hate teaming can avoid it and to truly test their skill against other people at their trophy level?
---
2) Are you thinking of adding a 6th slot for game modes as you could put special showdown events in there as well as the proposed duels? This could be a solution to bringing back life leech. üòâ
---
The benefits I see in duels (1v1):
---
1) No one to team with means no teaming.
---
2) Quicker matchmaking and a true test of skill for higher trophy players.
---
3) Allows players to learn 1v1 interactions and new brawlers with very little risk (see suggestions).
---
The problems I see with duels (1v1):
---
1) People stop playing solo showdown to play duels.
---
2) People have more incentive to team in solo showdown as it is not the only solo mode, and teaming becomes even worse.
---
3) other modes feel much longer, especially siege, as these would be very quick.
---
4) Certain brawlers would be amazing and others would be almost unusable, making people frustrated when they are beaten by the same brawler multiple times.
---
Suggestions for Duels (1v1) if you like the idea:
---
1) Have it be low trophy gain/loss as the rounds will be quick.
---
2) Have gas closing in but much slower than showdown.
---
3) Have different modes like best of 3 or best of 5.
---
4) Have a level balancing system that tries to pick brawlers of the same power level as well as wins in that game mode or total trophies.
---
5) Possibly have a betting system with gold or a new currency that is specific to duels and have a shop where all the things are a ton of the currency, but it can be bought with gold or obtained through boxes as a bonus like tickets or token doublers.
---
For the currency (possibly bring back chips?):
---
This could encourage end game play as the currency can also cost gold and this could have it's own little shop place where players can buy things like skins and profile customization offers, maybe enough of these would even let you buy a few gems.
---
I love Brawl Stars and all that the team does and I appreciate that you are allowing us to speak directly to you. I want to thank all of the Brawl Stars team for all the heart they put into this amazing game, and I hope find something useful in my suggestions and questions!
---
Good skin, but supercell will not add this, becouse that would be copyright...
---
Many people are focusing on brock's super and forgetting the rral reference that's why you need to take a break from brawl stars onr in a while 
---
I have got an idea about a clan war  sort of thing, Its a little inspired from CR.
---
 PREPARATION-To maintain the overall level consistency of brawlers, There will be a preparation day. I think a total of 10 clubs should take part (10 is too much? I guess no because the president and vicepresident choses who to take in war just like in COC so as few begginers and noob don't end up in war) The preparation day would have a brawl star island which has different modes to be played. Each person has three tokens hence he can play only 3 times on preparation day. Unlike usual matches, In these match we will get powerpoints after winning, no specific power point for a brawler just powerpoints. Like if a club collects 1000 powerpoints, the president can distribute the powerpoints to any brawler from 23,current brawlers. Now! If the president gives every token to only 3-4brawlers this can be a  problem cause every person does not have every brawler. Hence the president has to keep in mind the variety of brawler the people have. This system will create a exciting challenge,either to give all powerpoints to the brawler everyone has or to distribute it like few to legendaries,few to epics then most to rares and all. After the preparation day, if there are powerpoints left that are undistributed it will be automatically given to the brawler that has max chance of upgrade. The preparation day is of 1 full day.
---
BRAWLDAY- Now the brawl day is of 3 days..Each day will have a event(showdown,gemgrab,bb etc) Now, The club with maximum number of powerpoints aquired in the PREVIOUS war will get a benefit, they will be asked : Do you want to chose the sequence and events that will be held in war OR They want to chose the maps for randomly chosen events? If they chose former, They can chose (1)Showdown(2)Gemgrab(3)Bounty
---
OR else They can chose maps for events choses by the system. 
---
Now on the first day whatever the first event is. Everybody in war can play (One player one time one event) For a win you get +1Trophy for a loss 0Trophy. Similarly on the second day event each person can agin only play once, if its gem grab and number of people in war are 50. Then One random person will have a chance to play one more time. If a person hasnt played in the event in the starting of  12hours of the event, the President has choice to switch him with other person that is not in the war.
---
AWARDING SYSTEM- I have a thought of a different awarding system hope you like it. Teams will be arranged in order of trophies. Now, Each club will get a box according to their position in the list, In the box their is- (1) Powerpoint- 25√óNumber of player took part in war(let it be A)
---
(2)Coins- 50√óA
---
(3)Gems-3√óA
---
Elaboration on point 1- I have thought of a new system for point 1, The President will have two options for the first reward(unlike other two rewards which are directly divided to each player that took part in war), The President can either Distribute the powerpoints to every person that took part in the war 
---
OR
---
Give All the powerpoints obtained to their clan. This powerpoint will enhance their clan level and they will get enhanced reward in next victory LIKE       55Coins to everyperson..
---
TO those clubs who ranked below 5, They will get a negetive powerpoints to their club, HENCE they will get decresed reward on their next victory, They will have to increase their clan level for more victory.
---
THIS WAR THING, AS FAR I KNOW, IS VERY GOOD, I CAN'T FIND A LOOPHOLE.BUT I WILL VE GLAD TO KNOW IF YOU TOLD ME. 
---
I know the president is being a good amount of power, but why not? He is our leader isn't he. 
---
Have a strong and wise leader guys. 
---
Tell me If you like the idea and share it.
---
Lovee your stylee^^ amazing work
---
Forget to switch accounts much?
---
Are you thinking about making a lot more brawlers?
---
Why are the characters so unbalanced?
---
Mortis is pretty much unplayable. As long as the opposing team is smart, he can‚Äôt get close to do any damage and it turns into a 2v3 (I recognize some games Mortis gets kills, but honestly that‚Äôs below a certain skill cap).
---
Spike and Crow are really weak characters, which is disappointing for legendaries. Spikes shots depend heavily on the angle which it hits, which isn‚Äôt clear to players because it SPINS. Crow doesn‚Äôt do much damage and can only harass, and both die instantly to a couple well aimed shots.
---
Piper and Penny are situational. Daryl is outclassed by every other close ranged character, and becomes heavily situational because of his super that recharges.
---
Meanwhile, Shelly can hands down win any confrontation because she has FOUR shots.
---
I think I speak for all about being disappointed in the Barley nerf as well. Gambling his super Into close ranged stacks gave him a shot when people came close.

---
Oh god 3 supercell workers answered.Lucky you
---
Unpopular opinion: crow Pam and Tara look good
---
Will be there some new skins? Like for Tara,Leon,Crow etc...?
---
1. Do you plan on creating a battle pass style leveling system?
---
If so will we be avle to buy it with in game coins as well as real cash?
---
2.will we see community member created skins be brought into the game? 
---
3.how often should we expect a new game mode/set of new maps for existing game modes? 
---
Hello Supercell, I was wondering if you are thinking to make some kind of graphics to put it at  the end of every team match, and players could be able to see how much damage they did to enemy team or accuracy.
---
This could be implemented in other game modes like in showdown, showing how many people you killed or in bounty how many stars. 
---
I‚Äôve been playing this game for a couple years now and I still haven‚Äôt gotten any legendaries. Will there be changes added to the percentage chances of getting new brawlers
---
Yu com from Moder Russia? (I am kind of russian :])
---
Delete thug life eyeglass, please
---
This was addressed in the answer.
---
yep didn‚Äôt expect that :D
---
No sadly
---
Thank you! Finally a normal comment :') 
---
Replace the Powercube with good meme and Bull with Laziness.
---
How do people put brawler name next to theirs on reddit? And will there be a battlepass?
---
Cheers from Serbiaüá∑üá∏üá∑üá∏

Yes modifiers sucks... mainly meteur and mushroom.... energy drink is kindda luck too but is also something that you can do something about it... meteors and mushroom are so unpredictable and annoying I hope they eliminate them from the game... also I do love normal showdown too.... and agree with you is disapointing to have to play only with modifiers. 
---
When u get 100+ upvotes just for saying 2 words. ü§î
---
Hello, I wanted to ask if you could redesign Colt's Rocker skin so that he shoots stars instead of bullets
---
Thats a great catch, but I doubt they will release ab update then. I don't think they will release updates *that* quickly. Carl wouldn't be out yet! 
---
Maybe they release Carl then?ü§î
---
I think that they won't add spring traps at SD because you would be able to escape the poison with them
---
Leon ez
---
Sorry about the bad formatting of 1.5, I wanted to make it a separate point so that it was not like I was forcing it onto the devs.
---
Some of us already got the rewards for reaching 8000 trophies and above. For example, the 25 power points for reaching 8150 trophies. After the rewards are improved, like 75 power points instead of the 25, will we get the 50 power points we missed because we started playing before global release and reached high trophies before the update?
---
This would result in "manual timelines" 
---
People will start skipping days on their devices to get rewards
---
Hola hay alguna forma de aumentar la probabilidad de que toque brawler en cajas gratis?
---
Gracias
---
Hahaha... HOLD UP
---
You mean the one who prefers self promoted self made popular content creators instead of companies who occupy youtube and destroy the chance of self found youtubers getting some views?
---
goddam man, I love your figure, Jessie is my favourite brawler both in playstyle and design &lt;3 really love your job, keep it up man.
---
If you mean the dev build, they wont just give it to everyone. You need to grow your channel first.
---
Can fanmade brawlers get added in the game? If so can I share my idea with you guys?
---
Quick question; do you take skin suggestions? If So I made a list of some that i think could work out.
---
I was thinking about a skin for tarra, an Egyptian skin would work really well... her Super could look like a whirlpool of sand and she could throw tiles/runes not cards.
---
She doesn't like showing skin so I was even thing something like a mummie kinda look.
---
Another skin for Jessie could work too, Sci-fi Jessie with a hover/railgun athstetic.
---
Skin for Leon; assassin. Shrekins, cloak and has a blade of grass not a lollipop in his mouth e.g.
---
I don't have much for pam, maybe a nurse Skin? Shoots bandages, syringes and other medical stuff instead of scrap metal? 
---
A dark piper would be an easy enough skin. Just until you come up with a better one.
---
yes
---
Can you share some of your aspirations for the Brawlers? Like on which person/character you based them on while designing? Thanks!
---
*Auto rolls into a wall and bounces right back into Shelly's supers range*
---
Thanks for that! But you can say quietly what you do not like the map because I will do a post again by everything is again revised.
---
of course i‚Äôm saving my gems just for the limited skins rn
---
That‚Äôs hot
---
Thing is thats not how it works. The luck chances increase after a certain period of time AND after opening aproximately 100 brawl boxes (big and mega boxes may differ)
---
Will you add at least one skin from this video?
---
https://youtu.be/7r8WxbiNFt4
---
Since the map theme is a warehouse and one of the maps is called Swedish Siege in the game files, maybe it's an IKEA reference?
---
Will there be any sort of competitive or ranked mode?
---
Just upgrade her to lvl 9 and you will can...
---
Haha ol√° Portugal FTW
---
Pam or Spike. I'd say Crow but he is more annoying than OP.
---
Are you going to put missions or something to get gems more easily?
---
I got Leon at around the same number of trophies, haven't gotten a brawler in quite a while so maybe my luck will be like yours and I end up with Tara.
---
So can we like get stat report like :Deaths n kills at the end of the game .....so that we can compare with our team mates also it would be fair to know how good the star player really was....
---
how about dealing damage if someone don‚Äôt shoot for x amount of time at some distance as if someone shooting them  
---
and stop being damaged when they start attack each others
---
Hello, my name is Sanjar from Uzbekistan, I play 3 months since I play, you add 2 characters and your ambitions reach 300 characters can be less, but with an increase in the number of characters you have, the chances are to grow and besides, the rewards for the maximum amount of cups are also you are of this attitude yet it‚Äôs too early to talk about this characters only 23-24 I‚Äôm more interested in your opinion about this and how you feel about the profiles that were created specifically to raise 1 character in my 2 profile I play only Shelly on the cups General cups 500 cups on Shelly 450 Opponents in my selection are appropriate or much lower than my rank. Another question is what do you think about the event of voting? there will be selected the type of card and bonus card for example the chosen map of boulders bonus mushrooms. apart from those 5 that already exist, I am interested in your thoughts about clubs in the clash of clans. The clan wars were added later.Similar story with clash royale, is it worth waiting for the same story zles or do you have other plans for clubs? Thanks for the answer and forgive me for asking questions if there are any.
---
Maybe spread out spawn points
---
how often are we getting new characters?
---
WOOOOOOOOOOAAAAAH!!! :D
---
Neither I do. I just do not want to risk that much for a star token. 
---
First of all thank you to Supercell for giving such a mind blowing game to us!
---
Thank you for giving DND in this update!
---
Question/idea-
---
1. What's about Solo showdown being a ticketed event ? Will it solve the teaming issue in solo sd.. 
---
2. Will there more ranks above 20? 
---
3. Will we see global chat in game to recruit players?
---
4. Ryan , Frank and Dani - which are your favorite Brawlers?
---
Love the Game and The Brawl Stars Team !
---
Thank you
---
A Huge Fan of Brawl Stars
---
Hope you answer this will mean a lot to me üòä
---
You have to comment on their AMA post so they could be able to answer it. That's how r/brawlstars works
---
Lol that is so true
---
What‚Äôs the purpose/point of rolling around like that? I see a lot of players do it. 
---
You should add an kill based shop.
---
For example every kill in solo showdown would give you 1 star but in duo showdown you would get 1 star for defeating a team. The stars should drop on the ground and the first one to pick it up would get it no matter who killed the person or the team. The shop shouldnt be very cheap like for 100 stars you could get 50 gold or 25 power ups for any character. It would fix teaming and bush camping the whole match.
---
It's fine, just gotta prevent our community from becoming toxic
---
Yup He told me when I asked him about the job 
---
Why dont you make that there is more posibilty of getting a new brawler in the boxes depending on the number o f trophys that you have because playing with the same brawler sometimes is borring is a sugestion thankyou supercell
---
Are you going to add a new thower that can stun with electricty?
---
How is crow‚Äôs win rate still so high, tho.
---
Por qu√© no puedo cambiar mi nombre m√°s de 1 vez
---
What's she doing with her left hand?!
---
Is Tara, Pam or piper get a skin?
---
Will there be a global chat coming at all?
---
When will there be a bull nerf?
---
El primo looks....different ü§î
---
Bo or brok 
---
I just wanted Tara so much
---
how do you see a better way of random startups? because it is very complicated to lose 20/30 trophies because of random teams where people play incompetently.
---
These are my suggestions:
---
-some emojis, texts, something to communicate with teammates would be cool. (Wait, Block for me, get it, etc)
---
-More icons
---
-more battle tokens please 
---
-More skins
---
-Ability to hide the control sticks 
---
-More voice work from the characters 
---
-More slots for game modes
---
-Full screen on showdown?? I don‚Äôt like the black bars. Maybe it could start of full screen and get to that point? 
---
Might have more suggestions but this is what I have. 
---
I have to say, I‚Äôve been playing clash Royale since day 1, only reason I got wind of it was bc of all the attention clash of clans was receiving. I tried clash of clans and it wasn‚Äôt my cup of tea. Since trying clash Royale I‚Äôve never played a mobile game as much until that point. Spending money etc. With the release of Brawlstars, there‚Äôs a new champ. I‚Äôve played this game way more than clash Royale. You guys are very talented and know what you‚Äôre doing. Keep up the great work guys! 
---
They are considering the option of taking as a reference or doing co-operation with gedi_kor for future skins. I think it would be a great success on their part to work with the ...
---
**jessie just died**
---
holy crap yes
---
Because i got a offer earlier for 5,50 exactly the same, Just without the coins.. so I am paying ‚Ç¨10 for Just 3,5K coins?!
---
With an Infinity Gauntlet, his Super being him using a stone to pull someone in (maybe even multiple animations if it was an expensive one)
---
Quando vai ser lan√ßado o novo brawl carl
---
I'd be raging and clapping at the same time if I were your opponent
---
Very interesting. Will the Night Witch skin be modified?
---
Hi !
---
I'm French so excuse me for my english Who can have some errors ! üòÖ
---
I'd say to Supercell your games are my favorite games ! I love clash of clans and Brawl Stars !
---
I Just have √† question : why the skins on Brawl Stars cost a lot of gems ?
---
But this is a super game i love It and I know how it's hard to create a video game because I'm programmer !
---
Continue and cheer up ! üòâ 
---
Please no
---
Are you going to make a new brawler every month? And will you ever change Rico back?
---
Happy cake day!
---
When is Carl being released 
---
Do you think one day we can get controller support.I think that it will be easier to play if we could play with a controller and have better accuracy and move around.
---
I love it! Especially since its supposed to be like sky wars. This is literally the best map I have seen on refit and I have seen millions of maps. Good job dude I hope it gets added in the game!
---
I have no problems with the map.
---
Idk what do you think? ahahaa
---
Level her up
---
Any chance there will be something "Wild West" in the future of Brawl Stars?
---
(Even if it's an event, purchasable theme, etc?)
---
Also will there be customizable controls at any time soon? These current controls are a pain for me to use to this day (actually, since March 2018 it's been a pain, and I've been trying to adjust to it since day one of landscape).
---
You do new skins?(sorry for my English I'm from Russia and my English is bad)
---
Have you ever thought about a support brawler that also negatively affects the enemy team?
---
For example, I was thinking about a support brawler with a bomb-like super (similar in radius to Tara‚Äôs) that when friendly brawlers are hit it gives them a 10% damage boost and %10 less damage intake, however, when enemies are hit with it they get a 10% damage reduction and 10% increased damage intake.
---
What do you think?
---
Is Colt and Jessie the children of Pam and is Bull the father?
---
Don't know if you'll notice but you should make a gummy bear Nita skin. What are your thoughts???
---
Reminds me of Xerath of LoL, really cool!
---
Amazing design, as always!
---
not a problem! keep up the good work! &lt;3 
---
Can you add when we play friendly matches that we can use brawler's that we don't have. 
---
   
---
Someday they will make the user of brawl stars can create maps to play with friends or other people to play friendlies. I really love that you could create maps exclusively just to play with friends and that you could put some maps in the game so to play online and this would facilitate the work of creating new maps for you I am implying that you choose user maps and incorporate them a few days in the game I do not know if I explain but if you understood me please DO IT and if not good just put the function of creating maps to play with friends THANK YOU :) 
---
Yes
---
This gorgeous man is a hundred times better than caveman Frank.
---
supercell I lost all my trophies with a bug you can give me back because I shopped a lot but with the update of the gene I lost everything I can contact
---
I thing Leon is too strong.Do you have aby plans on nerfing him
---

---
what's wrong with that?
---
enter a button to report people who make teams.
---
No she already got it with the global release
---
I have one special question that I believe it's a problem for many, at least here in Europe.
---
What's up with the constant lag? It's so easy to lag in this game, so much that I have to turn off as much as I can in my wifi to be able to play properly. This won't happen in high demanding games and brawl stars is  simple game, how is this possible? Is it a server problem or a network performance issue? Also I would like to ask if there's any special email for ideas for the game(new game modes, new rewards system, new brawlers, etc.), for example, a payload mode for club wars would be awesome!. I hope you can read this. 
---
You should add skins to trophy road that you can‚Äôt get anywhere else 
---
RemindMe! 24 hours
---
I dont want to see this at all, I feel it will make an "us" and a "them" in brawl stars where people who pay money get exclusive skins or more rewards, versus people who play free to play who cant afford it/ dont want to buy it. I really dislike this about fortnite/pubg and I dont want to associate brawl stars with a battle pass either
---
That is so pointless. Why not just give you 250 coins straight up? you only get coins from boxes so why would we get a coin doubler from a box.
---
When we say buff crow, I don‚Äôt this is what that means 
---
Can you have the option for the community to vote between 5-6 different ideas and implement the top 2 most popular ones? Like maps and brawlers, or new mechanics to the game? Because I would love to be a part of it and it would make me feel more involved in the game than I already am lol 
---
Wait, are you talking about the Special Offer?
---
What?
---
made with mematic 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/amqoay/damn_supercell_is_that_a_joke_please_give_players/
---
Are You Going To Buff Crow? Please Buff Him. He's Too Low. 
---
Please Add Persian Language to GAME
---
Will crow and tara get a damage buff at their base level
---
It‚Äôs less than i was offered for lv 35
---
Can Pam get a much bigger nerf? To her damage or her walking speed? Personally she looks like she should have a really slow walking speed, and this type of nerf might change how she is played.
---
How often do you guys review balance changes and how do you track if a brawler needs a buff or a nerf
---
Le prix d√©termine la valeur. Rendre plus rare le rend plus frais quand ils voient quelqu'un avec eux, je suis en utilisant Google translate donc si cela semble bizarre c'est pourquoi

SPECTACULAR TRICKSHOT!!!
---
oh . first thank you for this cool game ! and welcome Dani !!
---
may be my question is stupid but .. ah 
---
can you make the ' old ricochet ' as a skin for rico ? please? if you can't now , maybe in the future ? 
---
\+ will you make a skin icon for brawlers in profile and in the match ?

Why "lol"

Supercell if u don't have like mortis and on friendly match can u put any brawllers u want to use? So can u pliz add that
---
If he/she said you don‚Äôt have much experience, then prove him/her wrong
---
HUH.... Eugenio :D
---
Are u sure its a buff
---
What app?
---
This is an English speaking sub but that‚Äôs okay
---
They'll add a single skin and a green background with Celtic music, just like their clash royale """"""Crossover event"""""""
---
This is the best yet
---
Rock
---
The execution of it obviously, not the concept. *lowers your pitchfork*
---
Because for 6 months I have not touched any brawler? Do I have very bad luck? 
---
Damn. That was the best Darryl Ult i've ever seen
---
During a tied game too, next level ball skillz. 
---
Will power point be easier to obtain?
---
Mortis doesn't jump on Dynamike, he swings his ass against him with his *thicc* shovel
---
OP ü§ô
---
Are they going to put dances or emotes on the brawl stars?
---
Jess profi vshy
---
1. Will there be different themes for maps? Like what you did for CNY?
---
2. Any exclusive skins for upcoming holidays or skins that have to do with movies/celebrities?
---
This would have been SO much better as an anniversary skin compared to Night witch Mortis
---
I have an idee for brawl stars so that max players can still enjoy the game. When you hit 1500 trophies you can prestige to prestige 1. When you do that your account is gonne reset and you can start from the beginning. The player with the highest prestige is than top player. All the monny you spend in the game at your 0 prestige you can use then back but if you spend 500‚Ç¨, than you only get 250‚Ç¨ to spend at your next prestige
---
Nope my statement stands tryhard.
---
I use Darryl as a gem grabber and killing off brawlers 
---
I noticed that too 
---
Can there be special offer to buy a brawler cheap every week 
---
r/olddynamike
---
Woo woo
---
Are you planning to add more stage elements like the jump pads? I really liked these in gem grab because I feel like it gave close-range brawlers more of a chance. 
---
Why is there a time limit on how many tokens you can earn? I get it wouldn't be great if people just keep earning boxes but after a bit of playing it just feels like I'm not progressing anymore. 
---
Do you have any more gamemodes in the works?
---
Why did you stop brush from regenerating?
---
How are ya
---
See I do, but even if I start walking away before Frank's super animation starts, (for instance when I see the super-circle turn yellow but before his animation actually begins) I still just barely get clipped by the tail end of the attack. Even when I'm using brawlers that walk faster than normal while keeping a respectable distance. Then I'm stuck waiting to get 3-hit to death and by then, he's already got his super AGAIN. And it goes through walls. I think all of Frank is fine its just his super that could use some tweaking. 
---
Are you thinking about adding a Casual Gamemode where you don't lose (or win) trophies? Like 2v2 battles in Clash Royale? That would be nice!
---
Do you think you'll make a heavyweight legendary?
---
Mank 
---
No one wants your opinion, primo.
---
I bought it anyways for the meme 
---
Brock
---
So you have a fair point. But for me if I was a major corporation trying to reel in more players and maybe some more money, I would try to extend that trophy road as far as possible, making sure players don't reach the max trophy cap on trophy road, which in turn forcing them to play more or pay more. I get it's selfish, but it also gives the top guys something to push forward to. And remove the gold that is past 10k and put something more valuable like power points or big boxes because if they are maxed out, might as well get gold, tickets, and gems for being that far up there.
---
Just a thought, ya know?
---
You guys are doing great btw. I've been playing your games (except for Hay day) since CoC came out.
---
Will you ever allow a Friend Request system??? I know theres another way to get your friends and stuff, but wouldn‚Äôt it be easier if there was a button to just simply add and accept, etc?
---
Then the battle pass will come out
---

Even if you bought it in its current state, I think even those who purchased it would agree that [this](https://i.redd.it/p9jygkcbn2j21.jpg) looks far better, and not because it looks less female, but less like a shitty cosplay and too much makeup.
---
nah shut up
---
Hello good taste to the point I found the solution to couples who are swodown only the first thing would be to give a warning to those who agan couple the warning would be sending a letter say if buelves to aser couple in Swodown we were aser that you can not Go back to play swodown for this day and this is my solution to your questions I bid farewell and Goodbye gladly

Brawl stars is the laggiest game ive ever played ?Do you have any plans to fix the lag ?
---
the map name in english are aim and shot
---
maybe because his super does no damage so crows star power makes him deal negative damage, canceling the effect?
---
Hammer should be a tower or cannon
---
Is there any hope that we will eventually see more stats at the end of each game? For example, damage per second, kill to death ratio, total deaths and kills, or stats unique to each game mode. I feel it to be annoying you cannot see why you are star player. 
---
Fortnite?
---
after 2 brawlers have been within 5 tiles (3 tiles if one or both are in bushes) of each other for 3 seconds, they will begin to lose 300 health per second until they leave the 5 tile radius. when they enter the 5-tile radius this will start again 
---
Bro, your not alone

I feel like it‚Äôs good if you are against Leon and crow but that pretty much it

Man people still use akinator 10+ years later?  How wild.

Will there be a capture the flag or 5v5 game mode coming any time soon? (Btw I love the new update, especially siege and the launch pads, keep up the hard work)

Could we buy skins or something with gold in the future? Because when you have all brawlers at level 10 the gold are useless.

I love how Frank takes a second to celebrate with you lol.

Will we get a friend request system?

That's how Brawl Stars works
---
Death is the silent guardian angel you never knew you had. 
---
I Hope Supercell learned from their mistakes and never release another 'joke' skin only they find amusing. Next time give us something like this, which is actually worth our money. And when the next Mortis skin arrives it better not be a ballerina or something equally silly.
---
A skin for Bo?
---
Will you possibly add trading brawlers?
---
*L a n d m i n e s*

SHOWDOWN SHOULD BE LIKE FFA IN COD. FIRST TO X AMOUNT OF KILLS! ALSO WHEN ARE WE GOING TO GET TEAM DEATH MATCH?

Better get some Flex Tape

Can there not be a trophy cap for replays? Some of my brawlers have some epic replays that I wanna share

*F r a n k ' s S u p e r*

Why my brother have about 1200 trophies and have all 3 mitics and 2 epic but haven't  2 superare, and I have about 2000 and have from super rare in down and all are golden?? Why I don't find anything:(  ?!

&gt;I didn't remember the exact bounty translation, I just knew that it literally meant "star house"
---
Yes...set a default language as a player when you start and then it does a from-&gt;to conversion for each player based on their setting. Won't be perfect, but will be good enough for a game like this.
---
I have to agree with bob on the fact that the map is a bit too long range. That large bush area near the river would be awesome for brawlers like Bull and Daryl, but the fact that you always spawn with someone nearby (Usually someone with long range), its harder to survive the first minute
---
Personally I think Leon is still far too op
---
There is a blue turtle crossing the street
---
Open Brawl Boxes...it literally tells you
---
It's not laggy for the majority of the player. you either have an outdated device or a bad internet connection bc it runs well on my 6.
---
Mortis
---
Would we receive new classes of characters and or new unique abilities like having the ability to rapid fire your weapon without having to wait for your meter to load back up that should be a unique ability for some mystic and super rare characters
---
I‚Äôm not sure if the idea that Legendaries should be better is the meme or what, but if it is there‚Äôs serious flaws in that logic. In short, it leads to unbalanced gameplay, and a more p2w stigma around the game, which leads to a decreased player base and less recognition in things like E Sports.

---
Red red red red
---
You'll get them back when you get matched with good randoms. I keep bouncing back and forth between 6750-6800 because I'll get matched with bad randoms for a while but then get a good group and go on a run
---
Why not just make the range of the IKE not have any blind spots, like by making the dotted line (the line that represents the IKE's range) a straight line that divides a section of the map?
---
What is the problem 
---
Btw I am a 1000 Trophies Noob and the last one who would deserve getting a Legendary
---
The box description says that when you unlock all brawlers of a certain raritey, the chance for other rewards increases. However, this does not appear to be the case. Is this true?
---
Nice. I like the face
---
boom the box then I beat the meat
---
Can you add more detailed stats to brawlers so i can know the speed or range of brawlers before i play with them? 
---
How does he have bo?
---
((
---
Will Crow get a buff? Also, It would be amazing if he got a Plague doctor skin. I would buy that in an instant.
---
Is there going to be an increase on legendary brawlers like easier to get them
---
 When is Carl coming? Also, will you make  any of GEDI-KOR‚Äôs skins?
---
He played before league rewards were introduced 
---
Hy! Do You want to add some new "emotes"?
---
Who‚Äôs good on this map?
---
You can't be THAT unlucky...you DO have a legendary
---
have thought about increasing the probability of getting legendary or decreasing the number of boxes that are required to increase the probability?
---
Yeah I know
---
You Write on a Public Website. Of cause I will not, what do you think where you are :,)
---
Like this more in depth format. Allows for more detailed descriptions and overall feels more informative. Keep up the great work! 
---
 Typical
---
Shelly.
---
Then why do you ask??? 
---
I tried that after reading, i got Bullü§î
---
When will Carl come out and when he does do the people who already have the super rares get him automatically      And This Game Is The BEST I love it good work Supercell
---
He would mow the grass ü§£ü§£
---
I thought I would get a new brawler from my first brawl box too
---
Hi I am VotMaximus and I really love brawl stars but I have big problem.I did not get any nev brawler for months.I opened a hundreds of boxes.Please fix that problem.I really want some new brawler.A lot of love from Croatia üòÅüòÅüòÅ.
---
To see if other people knew
---
will the lag problem be fixed soon? 
---
That would be the best thing in the world
---
Will you buff Leon because he is so much worse than other legendaries now.
---
JK - Brawl stars 
---
Amino ~
---
I'm betting Carl
---
Jessie is completely busted in most maps against randoms who just group up and get destroyed. I play with randoms and have fairly good success; since the mode came out I‚Äôve gained probably 150 trophies on Jessie with this one mode
---
17/18 is rank 20, my high power level is 7 i will don't risk for noe
---
SOLUTION FOR TEAMING: whilst the big event isn't on replace it through out the week with the deathmatch gamemode untill the weekends when the big event is on so people can chose which one they want to play!! 
---
And i got Leon amolst 2 months of getting nothing
---
Me
---
Are we going to see better trophy road rewards soon?
---
You should get in touch with SuperCell! You are so talented and it would be a shame if you could not show your amazing ideas to the world! 
---
What are fandoms?
---
Will you buff crow
---
I am lucky...
---
i think its good you don't end of story
---
Don't use your super for the last hit
---
That's a good idea I think. Would mean the only exploit would be at the dead centre of the line, and that's the easiest to defend. However, I also think that siege was designed to have explanation, for players skilled enough to take advantage of it. Admittedly, the penny thing is just obnoxious though, I think that should be a nerf on her cannon range instead though 
---
Would you be willing to take ideas on a new brawler idea I have? I'm asking in the official thread cuz it wouldn't make it to the front page and I can't draw said brawler
---
I love what you guys have been doing!
---
Q1:How could we directly give suggestions for you guys?
---
Q2:What are the 3 main goals for these next 2 months?
---
Will crow get a good buff? just asking for a friend
---
Cory need to meet condom mama XD
---
(google translate come to into condom in videos if you dont get it)
---
When i go to showdown and siege maps my screen gets smaller, i mean other maps are okay and shown in full screen but these 2 are not, my phone is all-screen (honor 8x)
---
Is it a bug? 
---
I like the idea of a club treasury, but what if the treasury got stuff put into it up by having the same people in a club form a team and win battles? That could encourage club participation!
---
My idea about teams in shotdown is very simple. Only  you hurt  one player of 8. Then there are a 4 singles PvP. The Next fase Will be 2 PvP And finaly the final PvP.  Solution: only 2 players can hurt in the field in the each fase ( quarter, semis And final. Your sincerely.
---
do you guys really think it‚Äôs the best time to add another character, while so many characters need remodels?
---
will you ever remove night witch mortis? please?
---
Will crow get buffed in the next update? Or at least a white crow remodel?
---
Khm i dint said mc as mc,i said mc as minecraft ,_,
---
Will we ever get a 1on1 mode or 2on2 ?
---
What do you guys think about Barley in showdownü§ñ
---
Very origonal
---
Why u bully with the flex?
---
**oh I know**
---
Were i can use this map creator?
---
Will there be a battle pass or something in the future? 
---
The trophy road reward will be changed? The rewards are too hard to take and are useless,but at 4000 trophies only megaboxes and if i have all brawlers i only can max my account
---
BUT HIS WRISTS
---
You're just unlucky. You will get him eventually, however, because of the luck mechanic. I got my first legendary at 4k-ish trophies (a bit recently), so you should be able to get him soon! Good luck! üòÅ
---
Fuck these liars u just got top 4 or 3 which gives you 0
---
They are limited edition skins so they disappear.
---
Will Teaming in showdown ever be stopped? And how are you gonna do it?
---
I think crow looks really good as he is
---
If they remodel, it better be plague doctor crow. That skin is too good not to be on the game
---
The megabox will have more chanses then the brawl box and big box?
---
Hi!
---
Are you guys working on an in-game map editor where we can make maps and then friendly battle on them?
---
I know there are sites out there to make maps (which I do use), but obviously playing on them would be a lot cooler!
---
* ***Have you considered putting in a season pass or other options like that?***
---
Can you nerf bo, bull,and el primo
---
Imagine being a primo and thinking your opinion matters lmao couldn‚Äôt be me
---
Call him... Frank King Stein
---
I live in DK but my local clubs are set to NO. Total trophy‚Äôs and Brawlers at local are set to DK. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs a bug, or simply because there ain‚Äôt any Danish clubs.
---
Sorry for bad English 
---
Hey Supercell I have 3100 cups but i only have 14 brawlers , and some friends have 19 brawlers with only 2500 cups (any bodi have put money in the account).
---
Can I have Leon and Carl for free?
---
Can you buff crow
---
Same, in game it is nice 
---
You should work for supercell!
---
Fools, they activated my trap card!

We should receive more game modes too like capture the flag and a 4v4 mode and maybe a clan tournament mode where only clans can participate in a team based games in a shuffled play list like heist and capture the flag 3v3 showdown on exclusives maps that change every round on the playlist
---
However stats such as damage taken and received are fundamental in the game. It's not just about who deals the killing blow. These are important stats which reflect the importance of a player in the game
---
Dis boi is trying to turn Brawl Stars into Fortnite
---
Do you guys plan on buffing crow? I know you did recently but I feel crow is one of the worst brawlers and it‚Äôs legendary...
---
¬ø? 
---
HAPPY FLIpPINN cAkE daY
---
The simple solution here would be to get Discord. It's completely free (there are benefits with Discord Turbo (I think that's what it's called), but they don't change voice chat at all), and there is a voice chat in it. Have a good brawling! üòÅ
---
It should be reversed
---
Happy cake day
---
Bought chests but hasn‚Äôt played?  Pretty simple answer. Lol
---
Hello! I've been playing brawl stars since its official launch, and opened way more boxes then some friends yet, I don't have a player with higher rarity of super rare, all ofy friends got some epics and legendary, so
---
 is it possible that every player has thier own chance of receiving a brawler? If so how does it work? 
---
can you give me lion
---
supercell: makes new and cool skins
---
r/brawlstars:
---
supercell: releases one bad skins
---
r/brawlstars: REALSHIT
---
Lol idk I'd say better maybe slightly more formidable but pointing out that classes usually have give and take Leon has gone through multiple nerfs which doesn't make too much sense in my opinion Leon was designed to be an assassin and a glass cannon at that he has low health, attack range may be "far" but really only relevant when up close and his super only makes him invisible but still detectable now we have a character like bull who has high health and high attack that when close range his on par if not better than Leon's he is a heavily used brawler so it's proof of how powerful he is and I think this why no one wants to touch him because everyone has access to him but only a few have gotten lucky enough to get a legendary character
---
Make em free, to hell with it
---
I loooovvvveee the "to be continued" videos. I want more! 
---
How is it possible for one team to accumulate that many bolts? Don't they reset if you win the round?
---
Me 2 i got it from a simple brawl box. A day after i got mortis from a simple box lucky me
---
Poor guy üò•
---
Will Crow Ever Get More Buffs? I feel like he should be better for a legendary character. Maybe a damage or health buff would be nice
---
Sick. This would be legit!
---
Like this but maybe replace the Easter eggs? 
---
Im so hyped
---
Will u be adding challenges like quests or stuff like do x damage and get a skin?
---
F=U
---
That is actually in the map
---
Is there a possibility of getting a random Legendary brawler in Daily Deals? If yes, then how much will it cost?
---
You go to put the 5v5 mode?
---
Will clubs be any use in the future(like in Clash Royale, where they have clan wars)or something similar to clan wars? Or where in the past Clash Royale used to have a clan chest, where the more trophies you get in a week the higher the reward in the clan chest and you can even call it the club box.
---
Are you planning on adding "emojis" or any kind of button dialogues to communicate with teammates during the Waiting Menu or in-game?
---
The mods here are terrible 
---
A man of culture as well, I see
---
Out of any of the fan brawlers made by the community, do any of you have personal favorites?
---
i dont know
---
It's 3 nerfs
---
Needs more jpg
---
This looks like some strange elsa gate stuff...
---
Yeah Supercell doesn't give crow justice...
---
No prob I'm personally a mid tier spender because Brawl is a game where I feel that even if I stop the progress won't just disappear since I'm not spending but the lvl difference is a pain I'm personally every brawler 300 at around 5 to 6 with one star power for my Colt but seeing friends who started the game later than me with 5 star powers and every brawler is rather disheartening.
---
He moved to another project.
---
They plan to introduce maps to the game of apps and not just the internet?
---
Best strategy for 10 iq ever
---
thank u
---
What does IKE stand for?
---
Lmao üòÇ trueee
---
Both are Spanish and both have the same skin color not on that but el primo means the cousin so yeah :/
---
Oh.. u/jumpei_supercell (checking his profile)
---
In any battle Royale game their will be characters that fit into an easier play style. This easier play style makes them more abundant in your matches; which gives the appearance that ‚Äúthe brawler must be overpowered if everyone is using him‚Äù. This is the case with tanks currently (except Pam; she just is a beast). While primo and bull certainly shine when you‚Äôre too close to them; they‚Äôre very easily countered by a large portion of brawlers; making them not as useful the higher the trophy range you‚Äôre at. 
---
If you‚Äôre concerned about players dodging your shots via walls or pillars; that‚Äôs frankly more opinion based. In the AMA they did briefly talk about adding a Free for all death match like event; where perhaps this could be applicable. But the walls and covers are essential to this game. Without them; certain brawlers would have the ability to completely overpower other brawlers on certain maps. 
---
Removed. Rule 3. No providing information on how to break Supercell Terms of Service.
---
Do you add Persian language to the game?
---
he should throw feathers
---
Staph
---
thanks bot! :) 
---
darryl town
---
Not many people play Brawl, and even less play RotMG. You sir are a treasure.
---
True. Honestly I think the best way would be to have it so you can‚Äôt use your super when you have the flag. 
---
i have an idea
---
every game is feast or famine no mods
---
I feel the same about Mortis
---
I know. But that didn't really say anything about the character's backstory
---
Once you get to above 300 on a certain brawler the matchmaking is based more on that brawlers cups. Before 300 it‚Äôs +5 -4. As long as you can win more then 50% of your games you will gain cups as after it‚Äôs +5 -5 . In hearthstone it is similar you gain a star lose a star although there is win streaks but there is a lot of rng in hearthstone you can easily have a much higher winrate in brawl stars from 900-1000 its +2 -7 meaning you have to win 4 times to make up one loss and many players have gotten brawlers above 1000. Showdown does have some randomness with the spawn and boxes.  
---
When does he come out
---
Its no longer el primo.....
---
Its EL MUSTACHOOOOO
---
Good meme
---
Happy cake day, btw.
---
the reason i dont like these maos is bc its to ez to escape from a figt cuz if the springs, downvote from meüòï
---
True Darryls don't hide in bushes 
---
Yea I feel that. I haven't spent a dime, started since global launch and it's really tempting to just buy a least the character unlocks or something just to catch up to everyone who is already Max account.
---
It‚Äôs also a form of BM (bad manners). It‚Äôs essentially the only emote in game we have lol. 
---
Lol what 
---
Curious
---
Booooooooooo
---
Shelex
---
Hey! First of all, Supercell, love the work that you are doing. An amazing and fun game :)
---
Will there be any ‚Äúfriendly‚Äù events? For instance, like a safe room where we can just run around as brawlers and chat, etc.? Maybe throw some kind of a brawl talk, but within the game. Hope you understand what I mean!
---
skins sell mate. i love em. if a good one comes out id spend gems on it over getting legendaries. still waiting for crow and spike yet i have lots of skins lol
---
I'm 4700 with no epics, mythics, and legendaries. You're EXTREMELY lucky to have Pam.
---
Hello there. Considering consistency is the key for success it would be great if you guys considered having the option for a locked static joystick. I find the current setups not very solid and a lot of times I find myself with no screen for keep dragging the joystick...
---
Thanks in advance.
---
You are right plague doctor is the best skin idea for crow
---
Are you going to rework Bo's main attack? (and maybe super)
---
The damage output buff was great but the main issue with his attack is it inherits the worse traits of good attacks. 
---
It lacks:
---
The high damage output for most close encounters (unlike shelly and bull)
---
the thin spread of multi projectile attacks (unlike colt and rico)
---
fast unload speed of the attack (unlike colt, bull and a lot of others)
---
the reload speed is also mediocre
---
Also another issue with bow is ever sinse the landscape update an issue under the radar with Bo is it's way to easy to spot him putting his mines down. 
---
Opponents usually know exactly where they are.
---
I suggest (don't have to respond to this part devs) that they either make opponents not see him place the mines or change the mines to drop 5 and initiate much faster but at the same time they are always visible and have no knock-back.
---
Also Bo remodel? 
---
I think that the star player should recive something, like 5/10 gold
---
Will Nita get a black bear skin?
---
What happen is you get a legendary those the percent goes back to we‚Äôre it all started or does it just stays were you left off
---
They look like two alabama rednecks abot to commit incest
---
Hooooooooooo-oh bad meme
---
Yugioh?
---
Yes that is the reason that would be great to see just a mode like that. Since maps have their own best and worst brawlers, with a map that does not conteins walls but only grass would be fun to try.
---
And btw, i can relate with the Pam thing, that deserves to be tittled as a beast.
---
When you shrink and resize an image is MS paint.
---
Captivating!
---
Because of because of because
---
yeah, no quality control from what I‚Äôve seen
---
Ok wouldn't expect any until after the inevitable remodel 
---
Hey guys! I wanted to ask you 2 questions.  
---
Right now when you have a brawler at 500 trophies, it's at max rank and there is no point to push more, besides leaderboard. Some of us don't play these brawlers to don't lose trophies. 
---
1 - Will you make a "casual" mode where you can play the game without losing trophies? Sometimes you don't want to concentrate too much, just chill and play with friends that are at lower trophies.
---
2 - Do you think the leaderboard system counting the total trophies is good enough? Do you plan to do different leagues system, more than push trophies?
---
For the moment, In order to push the leaderboard is a must have all brawlers at 500. But you need to do it with all available, and in the future there will be more. It looks like a system that aknowledge more the hours spent than a ratio between victories and defeats.
---
Thanks for hear us and keep the good work! 
---
Yeah I‚Äôm gonna go on a limb and say it‚Äôs not Brock. I‚Äôm pretty sure the consensus is Bull, but I‚Äôm gonna say hopefully it‚Äôs someone not in game yet. 
---
Will you implement 2D as a graphics option in the game? PD: I asked this question but I lost the thread and I do not know if they answered UwU
---
WHEN WILL YOU VOICE LEON PLEASE
---
If you use you have smol pp
---
No because the game values F2P and is not fortnite
---
How much did Supercell pay you?
---
just get one powerup lmao
---
Then you have already seen it before.
---
