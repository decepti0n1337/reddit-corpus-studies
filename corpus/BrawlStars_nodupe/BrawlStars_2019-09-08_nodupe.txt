I‚Äôm not saying I didn‚Äôt have good tm8s, if I believed that I would have said ‚ÄúI carried fandoms against kairostime‚Äù or ‚ÄúI and only I beat KairosTime time‚Äù. The point of that post was not I had good ransoms it was that not only did I play against KairosTime but I also beat him

It just makes showdown identity

Barley can kill Mortis about 1/3 of the time, actually. This would be more like Dynamike or Tick

Hello. It‚Äôs CLayCHeese.

---
I made Brawl Stars NIGHT MECHA CROW with air dry clay.
---
If you want, you can see the making video.üëâhttps://youtu.be/BUhWyHWlifk
---
THANK YOU!
---
u/L-Primo
---
Nice job copying another Reddit video with the exact same strategy. So proud!!!
---
My friend got 32. So lucky. My highest was 19
---
There‚Äôs a shelly that camped on their way to 1000 trophies at level 1. If you can do 500 for one, you can do it for just about all of them if you‚Äôre patient enough by camping. I don‚Äôt get why you‚Äôre so in disbelief that camping is still a viable strategy lmao
---
I feel like this has a  fire emblem vibe to it
---
It's switched by the amount of ammo bars spent in the switcher objective, not by the amount of hit it recieves
---
See ya in hot
---
How did you get boss fight in friendly games ?
---
Trophies in general mean nothing, that‚Äôs my point. That‚Äôs in part because 500 means nothing, and because pushing to 500 and higher is so easy through showdown.
---
the running tracks a good idea ngl
---
Nita should be a cowgirl, that is all.
---
WHERE CAN I FIND MORE LIKE THIS WE NEED A SUBREDDIT BASED ON THIS
---
Next up: give us all the brawlers at 100 trophies
---
oh ok
---
[removed]
---
Hi is this a good play?
---
But then that's reposting
---
This is an awful idea.
---
You stood your ground very well
---
Okay...
---
Are you willing to explain further ?
---
to bad it's an actual skin
---
Baby found in dumpster
---
Also maybe one tricking a brawler isn‚Äôt a good thing. It always annoys me when I‚Äôm pushing and I find I‚Äôm playing with 6k players at 600+. It‚Äôs nice to have a rank 25 brawler but maybe focus on your other ones before you start pushing above 600
---
It starts you at insane 16!
---
It's expanded :P
---
Thanks &lt;3 I think it will get more attention here though
---
3rd star power is going to be added next update(or the update after the next one)
---
I mean the coloring it looks more contrasted the floor looks much darker and the bushes look much lighter
---
So Negative
---
so everytime i do this i have to blueball a friend
---
I love how el primos head blends into Rico
---
After so much time without saying anything here I come to share the models, For those who are interested Send Me An private message  and I will give you the  folder with all the characters, the folder will be updating every time a new brawler comes out.

can you also use it in computer?
---
Lmao it‚Äôs cause he‚Äôs far away and Minecraft screenshots aren‚Äôt that good
---
Bringer of bats
---
No one asked
---
Since you clearly cannot accept the possibility that you may not be correct in that the strategy does not work, here is my 500 trophy Power 1 Darryl getting Rank 3 (+6 trophies) in showdown via camping:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nD5BrHBA\_UQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nD5BrHBA_UQ)
---
Got any G Fuel?
---
I agree but since then I had play considerably less because my parents were trying to get more than ready for school and I had a brawler to 500 before the update as well sadly I don‚Äôt have a single star power
---
hey u by the way how do you get that "poco" tag thingy
---
Ain't that already a thing
---
Bloons tower defense defense defense
---
How about cardboard box TV 8-bit
---
In this game type, 5 players try to destroy the IKE in the enemies base first. The extra IKE‚Äôs are to make the game last longer by slowing down enemy progress. There would also be minions that march from both sides at regular intervals, down each ‚Äúlane‚Äù that would meet in the middle of its perspective lane. You can help those minions ‚Äúpush‚Äù a lane by killing the enemies minions. The IKE‚Äôs would shoot the minions first which would provide a meat shield for players to also attack the IKE‚Äôs. 
---
TL;DR its a game of tug of war.
---
I was the Darryl lol
---
What annoys me is when, say, a Pam gets the first two cubes, and then the colt yoinks the third one.
---
You'll see it less as you get into the higher Bossfights, like Insane and Insane II, but you still see it on all stages from time to time.
---
The tanks should get all the cubes to maximize survivability, preferably Pam.
---
Yea u will here
---
This isn‚Äôt funny. Stop.
---
Frank is one of the hardest brawlers to play.

This keeps happening to me as well on boss fight causing my character to stop moving until I reset the sticks. Never had it happen until today.

I feel like someone either has, or is going edit 8-bit on kirito from sao

They look nothing alike. So I'm gonna assume racism...

he is strong but not absolutely op. he is weak to brock ,piper and throwers.  he could use a slight damage nerf but he probably won't get one.

Stop the spin. Yay
---
I have both since long time
---
Oh lol
---
FVCK I GOT LEON FROM A BIG BOX TODAY! HAHAHAHAHAHAA IM SO HAPPY
---
Np! I clearly knew they were teamed during the game...but when I went and watched the replay, I was even more disgusted because it was so obviously organized pre match. Don‚Äôt tell anyone, but in solos, I may or may not spin2win...but duos....I‚Äôve done it once and felt truly disgusted with myself. And never. Ever. Ever. Organized pre match. I‚Äôve been in duo with club members before and we notice after the fact...usually one of us kills the other and we brag and talk shit üòÇ
---
i can see the logo already used in jessie gang
---
I know it‚Äôs only 5 trophies. That‚Äôs not the point. But in order to get reset, I‚Äôd have to push up to 550 at least.
---
That means I‚Äôd be wasting my time pushing my Spike only to be at less trophies than I was before.
---
Why would I push up in trophies to only go down at the end.
---
Supercells logic of the new ranking system makes no sense at all.
---
Auto aim goes centre of goal regardless of what so u didnt

Now thats what we call, pporok ;)

I hear ya on the first part, the last part not so much...it's not me on here crying for a buff because I'm not do good in game. To me it seems like his star power " toxic " doesn't have a balanced power output for a star power. 
---
Maybe it's just me ....sure okay.
---
Maybe it isn't ? 
---
That's why I posted about discussion with this topic, so it could be discussed with the community.

I'm not one to hop on some game community and cry for better upgrades just because I'm crappy with a specific character, just didn't seem balanced to me.

I didn't even know about the last part, didn't know that subreddit existed. Maybe yea I can check it out and get tips on how to use crow better.

I missed this also due to your edit...Darryl and Jessie are perfect...maybe Tara could use a buff on dmg output? ....not sure on dmg or the star power ...but those 3 I have them nearly to 22 rank ...I feel those are in good shape at the moment.

Tag: #28V8GQUY8

Highly recommend the competitive sub. It‚Äôs 100x more useful than this one and actually has useful content. Your post would fit well there and not get drowned out by useless memes.
---
As for Crow‚Äôs SP‚ÄîI feel that it is SO underestimated by the community. 10% doesn‚Äôt seem like a lot, but it really adds up since it affects both you and your team. And it‚Äôs completely passive...It negates thousands upon thousands of damage every game whether you notice it or not. And it effectively brings Crow‚Äôs health up to 3733. Any buff to this SP would just wreck all 3v3 game modes.
---
I freaking hate Omen, i wonder why they get 20k easily
---
Imposter Tick is just Tick though, same with Imposter Thiccochet.

nope sorry

But did u get the last brawler?

I would blame trophy inflation honestly

CoC has more active players than BS. At least in Eastern Asia it is..
---
little bit of both I think

I'm kinda annoyed that the other team that wasn't teaming attacked you. if you see teamers, don't attack the ones who are getting teamed on, just try to save him or atleast kill one teamer and not attack the one getting teamed

Colt Pam and Bull are the best,

Bull gets all the cubes and mainly goes for the boss,

Colt stays at a distance to dodge the missiles and kill the mini bots and at 2:50 goes far away from the boss (Slick Boots Star Power required),

Pam helps Bull deal damage to the boss and heals him.

Its really frustrating to see people use these brawlers in big game, it makes me want to just give up and stop lol. Worst thing about this match was that the Mortis even took all of the power-ups....
---
Me too,I'm down haha

Thats exactly what i thought when Rosa came out! Colt ADC for sure. I think I‚Äôd like to try Jesse mid or Crow support, those are the two I play most.

It‚Äôs not that hard, ita not like theyre creating aome crazy new brawler or something.
---
X and Y are team, Y is lower teammate, Z is random
---
(X+Y)/2=Z, meaning the average between the teammates is the random, then make other team Z trophies and youre all set
---
its not hard to implement, currently its just X=Z, its just plugging in a simple equation and bam

Because you lose trophies for losing. So someone at 500 could easily lose 6 matches and suddenly they‚Äôre not at 500 any more, are they? The tilting in the old system was ridiculous. It happened as early as 300 - suddenly you‚Äôd play some matches and 10 minutes later be 50 trophies worse off. Which, of course, you would not get back at the same rate. Which is why I was gradually getting brawlers to 300 and then stopping playing them. Now, my goal is just 500 and then see what happens from there. It‚Äôs now achievable for casual players.

Agree they should have static modes for the other game types but I sure it is less about matchmaking and more about not wanting to give away too many tokens.

Same, i really like the new update. After i got all of my brawlers to rank 20, i felt accomplished. I tried to push more every time, but the season reset was getting in my way of pushing, so i kinda didn't try to get higher in trophies.The new update sets new goals that can be made without trophy resets, and that makes me actually want to work for something. On the other hand, the grinding is insane. You lose far too many trophies, and gain barely any. This is a problem, because it's not good to spend that much time just to get a higher rank. Here's the trophy system, it's crazy https://brawlstars.fandom.com/wiki/Trophies

Just a suggestion, if you attack, you come out, but if you attack and don't move, it only takes 3.5 seconds to go back into illiusion mode (Note: in this, darryl rolling would count as moving).

It's because people like to jump on the bandwagon. They see somebody get downvoted, they sometimes don't even know why, but join in anyways. Some random will just downvote you because they don't like your username or something, and then soon you'll be at -15k karma before you know it. It's just the way of the intenret.

Lol kid, you cant just ask for free things and get them. Supercell isnt going to personally read your reddit post. If if they did (very unlikely) they wouldnt respond to your begging. Best way of getting Leon is to buy him or actually grinding for him.

Hi my favorite brawler is carl. I really hope youll creare more characters like that. His skill cap is really high which makes him themost fun and most competitive character. Both of his star power completly changes the way yo play him which is sickkk

I was told that I had a lot of walls and that supercell would never accept my maps

Extra life is fine, except in Showdown. It‚Äôs a one time use unlike Band Aid, and thus is balanced, Besides, if you die in the early game, there isn‚Äôt much to be gained compared to something like going after the enemy‚Äôs 10 gems

Honestly though, it's a 8.25

Yes, I mean the enemy Mortis. I just couldn't find a replay of me scoring recently
