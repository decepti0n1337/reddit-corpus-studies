Ayy, your saving boxes! Your bound to get a new brawler with that
---
Yee
---
Agreed...but only IF played correctly.

Nice
---
3v3 gamemode
---

---
Maximum time: 3 minutes
---
Collect power cubes from boxes (the boxes in this gamemode have 4000 health instead of 6000) to become stronger (collecting one doesnt increase stats of your other two teammates) (you can have a maximum of 10 cubes in this gamemode)
---
The more power cubes you've collected, the more points your opponents get for killing you. (They get 1 point if you have either 0 or 1 power cubes)
---
There is a point in the middle where every 15 seconds a star spawns that increases your team's score by 1 when someone from your team collects it
---
The game ends either at max time (3 minutes) or when one team gets 80 points
---
Respawn speed is the same as Bounty
---
Boxes respawn in the positions they were destroyed 20 seconds after they are destroyed
---
It‚Äôs fine, but I agree with you, the draw music is way better than the other music.
---
Mortis teams as much as dynamike, no one ever said mortis opposes teaming
---
How did you create that?
---
Nice meme format
---
For anyone wondering, here's the original Cyanide and Happiness comic:

These icons are amazing

No nerfing it anymore is stupid and it would make it useless

I got a new phone, but never linked my supercell ID. I did link my Facebook, however

---
I just gave my opinion and you came cursing me because my opinion is different from yours.Now tell me if you are not 7
---
Mine is 0.04 lol
---

---
It is the worth legendary in my opinion... But I don't have it, so just ignores me.
---
He sucks.. trophy brawler are op
---
That's me ty buddy!!!
---
Why are you calling me 7? Is it because your close to that age?
---
But whatever I'm just gonna go on with my day surfing reddit
---
It's fine. With luck like yours, you'll make it anywhere, bro.
---
I already gave you the answer
---
Eh I think it‚Äôll probably happen eventually. And maybe a battlepass. Keeping people engaged with the game is pretty important, if people stop playing they also stop paying. I think clash royale had a pretty good revival when the battle pass came out didn‚Äôt they? I know at work it went from nobody was playing it anymore to everyone went back to it and was grinding that battlepass.    
---
I think the creep of how long it takes to max it would be fine to add new ways of making progress. Each new brawler extends the time to max by close to a month for just the power points, let alone unlocking the brawler if they are any high rarity. Then the star powers as well.

You do realize that by killing you that‚Äôs one less person attacking the bot and they charge their super making it easier for them to damage the bot? How about instead of whining, you learn how to play the mode?
---
HUMOUR
---
Ok i don't see how it's humour
---
I love that smug face under his pumpkin costume :3
---
It wasn‚Äôt actually him that made the art, you can see they don‚Äôt have eyes, and they are made out of small sticks. He took inspiration from him.
---
I agree with him/her 7/10. Good but not like Gedi Kor
---

 its a sarcastic idea making it humor

Well someone did something similar to this but this one looks weird

Ya know what screw this I'm tired of arguing I'm just gonna let people post whatever they want and my judgement will be an up or down vote

Oh no
---
Maybe redditors can help you with your problem for why have you been trying to contact them? Also its just a motherfucking retarded bot in the conversation who just keeps you going on a loop by letting you choose stupid irrelevant options and says that it is here to replace themselves.

Hey you finally died!
---
Hah...
---
11,000 trophies and i have none of legends, but my friend who on 3,000 had 2 legends but now he is not playing anymore
---
k. How many legends in total?
---
Once again, skins have no practical usage.
---
Wow
---
Dang this is better then the usual art I see uploaded
---
I'm glad you like it... („Å§ &gt;œâ‚óè)„Å§

No it doesnt sound spanish, it sounds more like french.
---
Tryhard or fake
---
Either or. Whoever you like the most I guess.
---
I agree, teaming is a pretty broad term. Some might even use it to describe when you players sandwich one between them as teaming.   
---
I don‚Äôt try to team every game, have I teamed in some games. Sure, as I bet everyone has. But it‚Äôs ‚Äútemporary teaming‚Äù that‚Äôs fine with me. If your ride or die for your teamer in showdown that‚Äôs a problem. If you team with someone and they get down to half health and you protect the mc and let them heal up that‚Äôs no good. You should be willing to backstab whoever you team with whenever the time is right.  
---
Sometimes it‚Äôs for sure the best option to team, like you said two lower power cube players vs a higher power cube player.
---
That's the thing, I like both equally.
---
Dang
---
2000 trophy user
---
Flip a coin? That‚Äôd work.
---
Temporary teaming is a good way to out it.
---
K, I'll tell you the results.
---
Well I'm not gonna lie he never pay anything  on brawl he just got both legendarys in brawl boxes
---
Brawl stars matchmaking doesnt consider total trophies as much as the brawler trophies. Also may be due to team matchmaking.
---
I don't think it's fast enough
---
that title...

I got primo

I wasn‚Äôt teaming

I was waiting for the mortis to finish up

Yeah, but like the other guy said, you were in shooting range of someone and not doing anything.

I want to get rank 1 local with all my brawlers :P
---

---
Google should do this
---
How do you know?
---
Yeah well I would have fucked up real bad if i accidentally hit the box instead of mortis
---
Toxic.....like crow, who is also legendary
---
nyeh heheh....TEAMER,I KNOW THAT YOU WILL NOT GIVE UP,SO I GOT AN IDEA....WHAT IS IT? IT IS....DEATH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
That's just your opinion on what is or isn't unfair, not the definition of cheating. When people form alliances in reality shows like Survivor, are they cheating? When somebody uses Bull on a map that's entirely bushes instead of a character that **can't** kill you in 2 auto hits as soon as they see you, is that cheating? The fact is that there's no rule saying you can't decide mid match to form an alliance with another player so it's not cheating. Is it unfair or unsportsmanlike? You obviously think so and if they form an alliance before entering I'd agree with you. But is it cheating? Objectively, no it's not.

BARE WITNESS TO MY THICCNESS

Push all your brawlers evenly, it makes getting trophies much easier

They wanted to make ambush better than snappy sniping cuz they were tired or nerfing snappy sniping. But honestly as a piper main dis buff was not necessary at all, they should‚Äôve just kept them the same, reworked snappy sniping so that ambush and snappy sniping would be on even grounds.

I always play bo with star power. Mecha skin too.

Unpopular opinion: Well, it could be popular, I just have yet to hear other people talk about this. They COMPLETELY screwed the mode HEIST. They took away all the good maps but around 2, and replaced them with weird layout really terrible maps, and it‚Äôs completely decreased the quality of what was one of my favorite game modes when I first began playing from around January to march
---

Matchmaking be like: power 5+power 4+power 1=power 9 power 4+power 4+power 1=power 9

So what's Jerry supposed to be?

Nope 16k. You are just proving my point by asking how many trophies i have lmao

The template was release by supercell and I just created a meme with it..so...I have a watermark of the meme..

I waa just trying to recover my old account and my main account got banned please help me

Please help me she cast shake spell on me and I can't stop.

Me *dies instantly*
---
Flair checks out
---
I need these icons real bad..
---
No I did, but I‚Äôm sure you had to have *really* hated the matchmaking for you to have gone to the little effort needed to try and keep people out of your games.
---
Thats true.
---
Btw, yesterday i got the most pro mortis player in BB as a random! He was probably from japan or somethin... Had that username... üòÑ
---
It's funny that the Darryl was mad at the Shelly, but they were the one who died first and did nothing at the start of the match. 
---
If the Darryl even bothered to try after the first goal, you guys could've scored and tied.
---
How about second star power bo in snake prairie
---
bruh, its not your template
---
Yeah, I get you. I just wanted to say that time here has its cost as well, but you're right that's the only thing you're saving this way.
---
Whoops
---
When i saw the title i was like "oh no no no this going to be cursed"
---
But after i saw the art i was like "wow! he's kinda hot"
---
Hey! Thanks for reporting this.  Can you PM me your player tag separately? I‚Äôm hoping this is an isolated case but will keep an eye out for more reports.

Typical toxic answer from a guy that loses games as much as OP

How can I save the ICONS! THR BOT ONLY SHOWS THEM

He fears no man...

But fears all woman.

I just wanna try to find this (Is this on a google PC? If not then how did you enter bs on PC? i rrmember there is a thing that lets you play mobilr games on PC)

Idk He is using my Internet i think

OK

Hi Futinghe!
---
Uh why arent you recommending r/SandyGang you know, the original?
---
Congrats 100 coins is super rare
---
I don‚Äôt know why you‚Äôre getting downvoted because you‚Äôre totally right. They added the auto aim feature for that intention because I can‚Äôt see why else it would‚Äôve been added; almost no indication by the devs adding it during beta or even the player base asking for it.

Apparently Alaska isn't in Russia anymore. Strange.

Still got none, also still missing Gene
---
People can‚Äôt handle the truth I guess. Everyone knows the old controls were superior and actually rewarded skill more than the current system. Maybe they should make those controls optional but they probably don‚Äôt care about it anymore.
---
Lmao what‚Äôs your trophies last year. Send your proof of your trophies last year

He is bad though.

Because fuck jessie
---
May i have a blank video download, id like to insult my brother this way
---
 Mythic
---
But the devs already lowered skill gap for new players when they introduced auto-aim
---
I feel bad for the Dyna and Tick. They carried that Tara the whole match only to have her throw the match at the end.
---
Your team had that win in overtime,  throwers cant defend the goal without walls. 
---
Good replay.
---
Happy Cake Day!
---
Ssshhhh
---
El Primo's remodel actually looks worse than the old
---
IMHO that doesn't make any sense, even if it's a new brawler, total trophies are more important than brawlers trophies in order to get a players level

That is v a l u e

A 9 yrs old would love Fortnite, this game was ok until 9 yrs old kids ruined it, this game might be ok, but now it's trash cuz 9 yrs old are ur enemies/teammates and it ruins the game and makes it trash, AND THAT'S A FACT. (I had to lol ik it's cringe)

Wait what. So you have to be 9 years old to like Fortnite? Also, how does the enemy being a 9 year old ruin it? Seems like an easy kill lol.

That happened to my account too

ut-oh gracias amigo, i‚Äôve only had reddit for a few weeks now

You cant just request supercell to give you a creator code 
---
I think you can get one if you have atleast 100k-500k subscribers.
---
Like 2 weeks ago
---
1. Well actually no, but 90% of the Fortnite players are 9.
---
2.  U play Fortnite, and not just Fortnite, ANY game, for your entertain FIRST. If BS was a boring game u wouldn't play it for the trophies, u would search for an entertaining game. If you'd face 9 yrs old all the time and get easy kills that'd be boring, the fun is the challenge.

you: gets close to tara

tara: uses super

Actually this is stolen. You just put brawl stars poco and dynamikes.

Not bad!
---
If it was "maxing out a legendary in Brawl Stars" and "maxing out a legendary in Clash Royale", it would be the other way round

I've maxed out Crow Spike and Sandy (no Leon) but my highest lvl legendary in Clash Royale is lvl 12 (miner 13/20), not even one maxed out yet

Man sadly I don‚Äôt play Sandy as much for this reason. Least entertaining climb of my life. (Before nerf) not even fun though man, all auto aim smh
---
Thats me when i play piper
---
Does it matter? 
---
Mortis isn't a robot or a skeleton yet his hat got removed for a while and they added it back only because of the fans. So there is no rule like robot's remodel should be hatless
---
And if it still matters, barley got a remodel at global he still got his hat
---
What!!
---
Everyone knows that already
---
Due to school I don't play a lot, lately I got to 200 tokens a lot so this trophy thing is almost useless

How skins decide a date for remodel?

I kinda play a lot, but still got non. While friend got 2 Legendary at 8k .3.

For the next piece of work, you register a copyright and sue the Frick outa him
---
What?! it is so much trophies
---
He just purchased them, that's so obvious
---
I hope I get crow or Spike instead of sandy.
---
Ok...
---
is this real or?
---
u/ryan_supercell watch out for this guy
---
That's the most illegal thing
---
Yes, but Crow is still better than Leon in 3v3. It goes like this Sandy&gt;Spike&gt;Crow&gt;Leon.
---
Your meme sucks
---
Frank : no hat mortis is my dad
---
Sooo getting nerfed

What is this trash

idk
---
Then Jessie Pam 8 bit would be the most op trip for any game mode

It gets better after 500 trophies on a character. But otherwise shit feels unplayable sometimes.

Just because yde doesnt use him doesnt mean he is bad. There are rlly good mortis mains that use him in bb

Thank you sir nopeboy

im poor if gems but i have 55 boxes

it's legendary and his health and attack are same as piper but super isnt
---
I-
---
Smurf account?
---
less grass pls
---
That would make the progress too fast. There are probably some people who have like 30k starpoints saved up and they could buy 20 megaboxes. Would make the game a little too f2p friendly.
---
I DID NOT DO THESE SKIN ICONS
---
3-10 gems for a moderate quest? Thats nothing. You can get 12 gems from a small box if youre lucky
---
I believe you didn‚Äôt make any of these...yikes

bonethrower means the minigunner which was removed and replaced by pam

I really like bees in videogames, I hope they add this one!

Umm no, it‚Äôs just your little Christian eyes can‚Äôt handle a woman in a dress out in a stroll with her cat companion. If a woman in a dress is too sexy and her cup size bothers you that much there‚Äôs something I tell all of you mortals like that. It‚Äôs my favorite things to tell people, can you guess what it is? No? Well I‚Äôll tell you! If you can‚Äôt handle the heat or you don‚Äôt like what you see you can gladly FUCK OFF ya ya‚úåÔ∏èü§ó
---
It‚Äôs worse when you somehow get on brawl star live and 1k people are watching you
---
Actually, you can also push on solo showdown in Double Trouble or the map that appears on the 2nd day of season reset. I never played any other mode except showdown. I thought that until I get my star power I will continue playing showdown.
---
Add your watermark everywhere
---
But this is the point of showdown.You must kill people.Also he wasn't trying to steal power cubes,he was waiting the Mortis to finish up.
---
I was one of their people, I did not downvote but I did disagree with it. For that I apologize

when his smurf account has more trophies than your main account

I would like a new Brawler category 'Radioactive'. And a brawler with 360¬∞ attack angle. Just ideas.
---
Even after the box was gone you didn‚Äôt attack
---
Bee sniper is already the name, in game files

Then you already have free skin. What is it? Bo or crow skin?

Umm thats cool but its a grimm reaper
---
Oh, Corby! Great to see ya again!
---
I love this idea so much! I can't wait to see this in game - I wish You good luck!
---
Howdy! Great to see ya too
---
Even if I wanted to, supercell wouldnt give me the star power lol. I guess Ill never have a life.
---
#no, mejor no, es malo para tu salud
---
This is a great idea, but they should reduce her main attack a little if they do this
---
Garry it is me Sammy
---
Oh ok
---
Thanks m8!
---
Then what brawler you got star powers
---
Dont expose
---
# 4 SOLO VICTORIES

Si

Supercell: No, I dont think will
---
What is wrong with her?
---
Totally agree, you're right
---
But unnecessary complaining about that. And very annoying to me when i the hundreth time read that "WhY aM i NoT gEtTiNg LeGeNdArYeS??". Dude. Nothing magic, nothing special stuff, if you are not getting barawlers YOU. ARE. UNLUCKY. So please...just stop it

---
How many trophies do you have?
---
Btw there's someone push 8bit to 1400+ before but IDK the name
---
Ah ok i understand
---
They should make it so everytime you shoot your turret it levels up and becomes stronger as well. Maybe even have it transform to look more advanced and deadly each time. Last transformation it gains legs and can actually chase people down.
---
Thank you. I didn‚Äôt. I just do my work for the fun of it :)

Frank: "Piper is the best brawler in brawl ball"
---
When you realise that the randoms this guy has been playing with have similar IGNs.
---
yeah, just pass throug structure, stopping no aim, no brain jessies ( same ones who complained that her shots are hard to hit ) from just shooting turrets and hoping it will bounce on enemy
---
Idk it‚Äôs not showing up &gt;\_&lt;
---
Sadly, randoms don‚Äôt know how to read
---
It looks waaaay better
---
I was upvote #1000
---
They could compensate by making her heal 500 instead of 800
---
Just a heads up. A sneak peek is an opportunity to see something before it is publicly available. A sneak peak is the tip of a mountain engaging in furtive or stealthy maneuvers.
---
I had this idea of el poco for a loooooong time...
---
It‚Äôs a bit scummy to just create it like that but he did say he faked it sooooo
---
1k rn
---
Thanks God this person understands me...
---
Not all heroes wear capes
---
Might be that he has been playing before the new trophy system update! I know how hard it is to get to 800 trophies, with power 1 even harder! My best is my power 1 Colt 663 trophies! (My in geneal best is Nita 901 trophies!) If you wana see my Colt power 1 account search in clubs: EU Tuna and you will see my 2nd account Cannon Man!
---
Cool

Buff jessie uwu please

Or if you‚Äôre both low health and you‚Äôre trying to take away their attack while using your own.

Why is there an exit button.

Guess this meme is sort of relatable to you ( the e and the a in Barley are reversed)

Lol nice

Nah you right, I forgot to add my watermark. I‚Äôll just post it again in my profile with my watermark  on it
---
Yde:oh, you're approaching me?
---
Whoever built Darryl didn't give him speakers. He can only scream internally
---
He has low health and struggles on a few maps. Like I dead some flaws but not an abysmal amount hence the 8/10 rating.
---
Do I know you?
---
I‚Äôm a noob, but how do I access game code? (Sorry for bad English)
---
They should do what most competitive games do and average the trophies of the brawler.
---

---
how??
---
Mortis strike again
---
You know that‚Äôs his star power right?
---
XDDDDDDDDDDD
---
It would be absolutely op when Jessie‚Äôs turret, Pam‚Äôs helming machine, and 8bits booster are all next to each other. Reducing the healing in attempt to balance would make it terrible with just Jessie‚Äôs turret. This shouldn‚Äôt be implemented
---
Im teaming in showdown
---
‚ÄúWhen you score your own goal, go kill yourself‚Äù is also a good one to add
---
When did the song came out?
---
Lmao wtf
---
Por favor
---
in game files and i don't know how it will damage enemies but it's real
---
Reminds me of Widowmaker's close range move. I wouldn't get how we reload speed would work if she is at close range (we also wouldn't want to kill snappy sniping). Maybe it can be like Bibi's bat as well when the umbrella attack opens once (but less knock back than Bibi's)
---
Amazing art
---
takedown
---
Or ‚ÄúIn Brawl Ball, if a teammate is in a better position to score a goal and enemies are spawning, pass the ball to your teammate instead of attempting to score through several invincible enemies.‚Äù
---
This one is infuriating.
---
Very good SD map but horrible LS map
---
Guys calm!!! His is giving credits in the description
---
Happened to me fucking 5 minutes ago. I was spinning hella fast but my bibi teammate used special shoot on the enemy in front of her instead of passing me
---
A precious Barley, he can spins, that's who the Dyna is for.
---
Let's spam ALL your posts saying: "This person steals Reddit memes"
---
The problem with this is that this makes her too team dependent. She would be in the same boat as Poco. I get that they can nerf the healing in order to activate this rework but, as I said, she would face team comp problems.
---
He should have more Viking like face decals
---
every country except the U.S. calls it football.
---
Here before this gets overused and is all over the fucking reddit.
---
They need to add *"In Takedown, focus on attacking the robot instead of wasting time to 1v1 other brawlers and be a nuisance!"*
---
Really? I didn't know that he will be a legendary
---
True enough
---
The randoms I play with wont pass me the ball when the enemy is spawning and I was near to the goal.We ended up losing.
---
Ye I forgot to mention
---
I know, I‚Äôm just messing with you.
---
Majority of Reddit is American though.
---
Skins on trophy road? The most useless thing I've seen. And the skin.... Really?
---
in cards.csv, it says it is legendary, but i cant find anything special to make it legendary
---
Good job

Oh shit

how many trophies do YOU have?

---
In head this time billy

I like that idea, maybe I could serve as Star power
---
That was a big box not a regular and when you max power points you get more coins instead
---
and leon has 3 star powers now in game files
---
Power 1 sandy is better than any other power 10 brawler ngl
---
I love his axe!
---
I now main my mini more than my main account
---
What, It's not all about that. Some brawler models aren't very good and they have something better
---
It should be that it recovers health, but not as much as her normal turret.
---
They would if they had save it ...
---
I agree
---

When will people stop adding mechanics because of Brawlers personalities and actually think about if their balanced?

I didn't know that, i made it by myself.

*thanks* u mean

I will dm him since replying to a comment breaks the rules. Also thanks for the credit!

Why does Crow need a remodel anyways? I think he looks cool.

I doubt they will take our hat brother, It‚Äôs the only thing that shows we‚Äôre part of the Pirate gang.
---
This is amazing!
---
*no*
---
I like it!
---
Yaaay you hate my post
---
Nope,imagine pam ,8 bit and Jessie in the same team that's already a good combo but now imagine Jessie always healing those turrets. Infinite Heal+ extra damage+ defensive turret.
---
Oh for fricks sake Bibi....those were for the new bat!
---
As a Jessie main i can't relate
---
Am i a hero now?
---
"Jess will fix it"
---
Ded meme lol

There might be a 30 gem skin, if they like us.
---
Oh wait the shelly is you...
---
Yeh sorry i posted it twice with different text tho like different meme if u understand
---
Why
---
I mean a super that can knock back and break walls has to be kinda balanced
---
No spike no fumes o si no te rewokean y igual como van aser con crow lo unucio un manaller de supercell
---
No problem
---
Thanks. :P
---
I cant understand his mechanics. But it doesnt stop me to say SP 2 is op. The damage is too big. Imagine Shelly Super at you close range. Also damage is too low. 280 is not a big deal. SP 1 fixes it to some point, but its again low.
---
I thought Leon was 10 or something
---
What do you mean HER?!
---
wrong Mortis is **ASSASSIN** and he needs to go for kills for the protection of the ball carrier he offers neither health nor mobility when he has the ball because his reload speed doesn't let him be mobile and for that reason the most players lose the game
---
I keep noticing that bibi is weirdly the most favorite brawler in community form but is not really that good in the game anymore but this IS my opinion right, so? who even care about someone's different opinion it's still an option to think about teasing people about  their opinions it just weird.
---
He's a BOY
---
I laget hard when i saw your coment
---
But his model fits fine with the modern brawl star models, I had no idea his model is very old until today.
---
Same with Darryl.

---
Then why are you posting them? At least give credit
---
Actually no the new buff made him easily the most annoying brawler and he needs no more buffs instead a nerf
---
Mortis ! At the disco
---
I don‚Äôt think new primo is trash, I find it weird at first but I got used to it fast and it‚Äôs not that bad.
---
Always happen

but do you have all the star points? because i do so i only get coins or sometimes a star power

*why*

I wanna say good luck to you, but I don't have any luck to spare.
---
Kairos hates everybrawler on the game
---
thanks :)
---
What does BMing mean?
---
His victory pose is boring and his design is little poor like pam's
---
He‚Äôs still trash on all 3v3s he needs a buff for sure
---
oops i didn‚Äôt mean to upload the whole replay i was just trying to upload the last 5 seconds + overtime
---
Yeah I had an open shot because everyone was down the map then someone died so because I was right at the goal they could have passed it to me but my t eamate just walked and went past me so he could throw it but the enemy team got it and we lost
---
@frank can I have crow
---
it would most likely be changed to mythic since it's more unique than a basic piper and we have 3 mythics and 4 leggies
---
But wait... pam or darryl O_o because last posts i saw frank saying about pam
---
That would make 8-Bit Pam Jesse teams broken and unfair,

---
Looks great though
---
No Hat mortis is good
---
That Rico is staying alive at 1HP, what a legend
---
I agree with everything in this comment.
---
I would honestly say that the weakest legendary in terms of usability is spike, even though spike has insane amounts of burst damage and a good AoE slow, he lacks health and can be taken out relatively easily, his first star power provides him with heal but is limited to his super, which is normally used to take control of a portion of the map, while curveball actually isn't as strong because of the fact that standing around the mid range of his attack allows u to dodge the spikes, making it slightly easier to counteract that particular ability imo
---
Crow is super strong, due to his consistent DPS and he has a super that allows for quick escape and repositioning and/or burst damage when landing, that fact that his star powers can enhance his crowd control ability by weakening opponents or deal extra damage to low health brawlers really compliments his playstyle
---
Leon on the other hand is also stronger than spike (IMO) due to his higher survivability and burst damage he can still dish out, making him an incredible back line assassin in 3v3 as well, his speed star power (which I think is infinitely better than heal) helps him maneuver around the map much easier and he can also help with dealing damage to close range brawlers from mid range
---
Sandy is just good due to his health advantage over spike and crow and the wide area damage similar to poco, the quick charge on super also helps in his usage while the ability to deal 40 damage through star power, although it has way less impact now, can still do it's job in keeping enemies from properly disengaging and healing. On the other hand I feel his healing star power is almost too good now in comparison due to the fact that a 300 heal per second for 12 seconds is insane especially considering how wide the super area is, it's essentially a weakened invisiheal for the whole team, which can drastically change the way team fights go, considering the fact that brawlers with damage reduction like daryl, Rosa and bibi exist in the game 
---
But this is just my take on the situation so u r obviously entitled to ur own opinion, however I would really like to see ur responses or points against this

he already said they asked for permission
---
They think you died

So thats when your whole team is wiped in bb and the enemy team is spinning with the ball infront if your goal?
---
Ok your right i was saying bb but i ment 1v1 my mistake sorry
---
So... why are you proud that you‚Äôve admitted using your brawler takes no skill (in terms of shooting/aiming)? And look, I‚Äôm not trying to start a big argument here, just genuinely curious why.

8-Bit: am I a joke to you?
---
I think the orb should travel through the turret at normal speed when it hits it, it feels like a disadvantage when I put the turret in front of me and shoot at people from not a far distance and it dosent get them because it travels too slow and not as far, and feels like it would have been better if I didn't have the sp equipped.
---
Exactly, this is a BM
---
My point is that everyone wins if the big brawler doesn't fight back because you're more likely to be in the hunting party.
---
I don‚Äôt hate your posts it‚Äôs just that I don‚Äôt want the same memes over and over again. Sorry if I hurt your feelings.

Yes, but that means he would have had. To find where that paragraph was, Ctrl c, and Ctrl v onto my post, why....

Also pass it to the teammate who is closest to the goal.

Ive lost so many games because the enemy team is wiped and the guy with the ball wont give it up and doesnt make it in time.

Looked like a more "serious" game, without that Supercell touch. I remember downloading it and starting to count how much time and many chips it would take to get spike lol

him being slow can be annoying sometimes but his overwhelming damage just makes it easy to push trophies with him

but actually in game files, jessie has moving turret as her 3rd star power, now i am extremely curious for the next update and brawl talk

Insane dps and map control, rivaling Piper on open maps while also being great on semi-closed ones. He absolutely sucks in showdown and the likes due to his movement speed, but he's pretty broken in any gamemode where he can afford holding a single spot.
---
Needs good teammates to capitalize on that, though, as he can't push himself, only hold. That might be why you aren't having much luck with him.
---
Why are the sparkling eyes on his nostrils and not his eyes?
---
The starpower!!!
---
Every company should hire this guy
---
Slash and Dash, your opinion is crap
---
Yea, 8-bit use Player2 gun because the Player 1 is the Player

Because playing since android release is such an unbelieveable thing that I must give you a proof of it.

U clearly have something to show from October to December before global
---
PLEASE NO! Piper already need a huge nerf, don‚Äôt buff her again please üôèüò≠
---
It‚Äôs just a flair.
---
Pass to enemies?
---
"I have the fastest attack in the game"
---
One thing that you can also do is if you have the ball and you suddenly start 1v1ing an enemy, pass the ball to them. Once they have the ball they can‚Äôt attack you unless they pass the ball, meaning you can get as many attacks in before they do it. It seems like common sense, but it is sooo helpful.

I keep my hands off the football has as much as possible and try to run interference for the good players

He's not afk, he's clearly a coward camping for second. Little shit got first out of luck and absolutely did not deserve it.
---
I'm sharing this deliberately because the circumstances as to why I came third aren't what matter, if you're really that interested in my performance I have other highlights on my profile. What really matters to me is that shitheels like the *Mortis* in this clip, not the colt wherever you got that from, farm trophies through cowardice that they absolutely do not deserve.
---
Lol feels bad man. When I say challenge I mean like a fun game to see how well I can do
---
You need a brain
---
Poor sans
---
did you realize yet that this isnt a game where skill is that much required ? it s a game for kids around 12 yrs old
---
It could make for an interesting starpower imo
---
Okd meme
---
It‚Äôs really cool to see Piper hitting people with her trusty umbrella
---
Yeah especially when your team consists of ‚Äúleon el pro‚Äù and Bot 2‚Äù
---
Tick+Dynamike=Dick!!11 XDDDDD
---
I mean....well...uh....I don‚Äôt know what to say about this...
---
But that‚Äôs why there‚Äôs two star powers, situational star powers are good, especially ones that promote a team environment
---
uhm. so just melee what every healer has?
---
Very true. People just keep the ball from themselves when surrounded by 3 enemies
---
Same for the 14k one soooooo...
---
whos snas
---
Well, you're the one with a missing brain
---
and dont pass it to teammates when there are 1v1 ing someone else. also dont pass it to brawlers like spike / tara /8 bit etc

Well, you did well in this video

Hey, you deleted the post I cannot see nor remember who it was. And to be fair if someone has lots of cubes I can't exactly fight them head on. Anyways peace out.

What if he was trying to do a 0 wins challenge

We all have a sun, right?

And the sun is REALLY old.

Oh no! What have i done?! D:

You can have more than 99 power cubes, I once had 111 cubes in a friendly takedown match. But maybe supercell changed that

Would you wanna upvote this tho?

Nice idea OP

It is funny because is true

*Cough* Ppl who created their account before 2019 but didn't play beta *Cough*
---
I dont know might be useful in somewhere like brawl ball or showdown but in the rest kinda not useful
---
It‚Äôs so detailed and before seeing the title I just thought it was just supercell merch of one of the figures they sometimes sells in things like clash royale
---
I have a Russian friend who sends me memes, sometimes brawl stars related. he says he takes them from Instagram. I tell him to fuckin stop, because all original stuff was born on REDDIT, not the heckin Instagram.
---
I doubt it translates to soccer. Seeing as how it is football. Also whenever anyone says America they mean the states if they meant the continent they would say North or South.
---
That‚Äôs a great idea!
---
Because your account was just made recently?

I want his voice to be like in the trailer 8)

AYE NOW ITS AN AGREEMENT MEME (caps cause idk just wanna)

Thanks. If you don't mind sharing, what do you think of this idea? More of the brawler idea, not the rarity thing

Sorry for mention u/Frank_supercell u/Ryan_supercell

Oh no this is a bAd

No. Wasn't indended at all as a joke

I flip out when that happens
---
4/10 nice effort I could never do that :|
---
something tells me this would be a star power and rather strong
---
I thought you were dead at first
---
A sandy in a team, what would you expect?
---
Wtf what kind of kid is that
---
The post is a joke. OK?
---
Just curios, why not remove them?
---
Helal lan size .ss
---
Your prob a bad random. We will never know
---
But how i can?
---
its because u have all the other brawlers.  the more brawlers you have, the less your chance will be which is why beginners tend to get legendaries
---
Well you missed the B I B I nerf
---
Closing the god damn door
---
I think Tara is so cute :'(
---
Or dont pass to a bibi walking into the enimies with a full home run bar
---
CLOSING A GODDAMN DOOR
---
Carl and his tools have had enough shit
---
But Tick is actually a good brawler
---
Yes, skin is only esthetic , 50 coins are way more useful because you can upgrade brawlers with them.
---
Free everything is a bit much, like the all trophy road brawlers one is... bad to say the least. I think they should give everyone a free skin per year, not 500 Star Points (even though that is pretty much free) or like 30 gems. Something simple like "login during the week of halloween to get this free LE skin" or just for creating accounts before 2020, kinda like star shelly.
---
Then she could get a star power that adds a little knockback to the umbrella to help push them to shot distance or just help you get away a little bit
---
If he posted his art somewhere else, provide us a link to it
---
and do NOT auto aim when you have it
---
fax
---
****Thinking****
---
_These fleshbags think they can stop me from calling them fleshbags_
---
__Evil music intensifies__
---
Or even a attack like BiBi that knocks back but uses two bars of energy. 
---
You could follow up the knockback with a single shot which consume all three bars of energy.
---
Frank from supercell said they aren't going to make anymore "officially/strictly limited skins. They don't want to make any more skins that only come around once. Besides the Shelly skin, all the others have been changed to just limited during a time. Like Christmas skins last year will be back this Christmas but you can only get them during Christmas time, etc. Just like how royal agent colt came back from last lunar festival
---
I guess but more ppl know about video game systems than songs
---
I got Spike from a free box in the shop. It's just a meme.
---
U mean it doesnt even have to be good.
---
I loved it

That‚Äôs a pretty interesting idea my dude.

Tick!! Hey
---
why did u post it again
---
Why they be like that
---
Bruh...
---
True but all I did is get bunch of 3D preset shapes and combine them
---
Where did u message to Brawl Stars team?
---
Would probably need to be rebalanced seeing as the SP is already one of the best, but if, for example, Energize was changed to consistently restore 700 hitpoints to all allied turrets, healing stations, or boosters, then that could work.
---
He THICC
---
pro tip: dont beg for upvotes
---
Oh... I guess he says all of this on twitter? Everyone seems to know everything that Frank says but idek where they hear it

He has a thermos in his rocket launcher

then the 8 bit proceeds to try to shuffle away from you

---
Thank you but I am sorry that people can‚Äôt check my social networks and understand that this is my drawing.  They just write that I stole it(Sorry for my English)
---
That would be too much to be a compensation. That would make the SP bad even in comps with both teammates having a stationary super.

Ok

oh no shes buying fallout 76 no

H√© is a kid who need attention

Hey was there anything in the files for voicelines or skins for this brawler? Also does it say the rarity in the code
---
Just say Chomper Spike ffs
---
the one to the right is cursed
---
Good idea
---
Yes it does
---
Thats me with eny brawler
---
Same! I was mad
---
I like your meme templates
---
ye um well i play atleast 7-8hrs or if im free then minimim 10hrs ive reduced to 2hrs after my thumb started giving me pain tho
---
Myea... he had no ideea  :))

what you called this lol XD

I A m B a d I n E n g l I s h. Btw what even is this, kid?

I laghed hard

How does one not get bored after 10 hours of brawl stars a day
---
Camp + Team/Focus = cancer mode
---
Thanks fore using my template i saw this in the coments relly funny
---
They said they are removing randomness from the game so this shouldn't be happening
---
check the bushes, modifiers
---
Wow. Seriously?
---
I know, thanks for the template, but you said that already xD
---
Modding is important but alright
---
This is cool but wy did you do the old spike
---
Yeah it's a game that spawned memes
---
It's a good game as well!
---
For bow most people hold bows on their left hand not right. So box could be right handed
---
so you say...
---
I also want the 360¬∞ main attack
---
Let me guess, demon and Sylph. Yeah, 58k attack damage sounds about fine aswell
---
The weirdo with the beardo
---
you're lucky enough to even have 2 of the mythics! I got my Leon, Mortis, and Tara at like 10.5k
---
But the footage will still have to be reviewed and then a punishment will still have to be decided on. What you said is literally what a report is. The only ‚Äúnew‚Äù thing is a description of what happened, but that‚Äôs redundant since there would be footage anyway.
---
11-10.
---
&gt;!Yes, 11-10 (1), not 11/10!&lt;

Dude first of all you don‚Äôt ‚Äúlike posts‚Äù your clearly a normie second this is just karma whoring make an original post not begging for ‚Äúlikes‚Äù and many you will get some

Wassup, u want some grass

This meme is garbage

The template is from u/Memesthememe

I think Frank didn't super because I could've just walked behind him, but I might have lost if he did a normal attack and Colt finished me off.
---
Mama's squeeze.
---
¬ø?
---
What does that mean
---
It‚Äôs not my fault every time I go to Attack or use my super someone passes the ball to me last second
---
Haven't you learnt brawler star powers ? XP

Spinning Facts

Personally, the fact that he copied is bad. I would still hate him if he credited.
---
What do the star powers have to do with this
---
Badass
---
The best solution is play with friends!!! The fuck why i didn't did it i sorry i am gona play with my friends goodby
---
This thing got famous. And i dident expect that lol. So im gonna take advantage of it and try to make this map famous
---
https://crux.page.link/EqQH6

Lets try to make this horrible creation get into the game

LOL , you don't get the joke .

Good for Halloween update
---
Oh then pls , explain
---
-10
---
You asked if i realize pam is jessie's mother , instead of saying yes normally i just used her star power as a funny reply.
---
I would like that, the backflip that he does in the current animation isn't that good, I feel like it could be smoother.
---
Some random youtubers =Like and subscribe to get legendaries 
---
Legendaries = am I a joke to you
---
did I just read
---
What about "This game is so bad. Why."
---
So that means Bibi's shield, Pam's Hug, Rosa's Bush Heal are some that don't work, right? Thank you very much.
---
I like the current one better, but this one will be kinda ok for el rey
---
It got cropped out by reddit üòÇ
---
BR FAZENDO VIDEO DE QUALIDADE!
---
***bubble trouble***
---
First, this is really an aesthetic change more than everything because she would stay fairly similar
---
Second, I think Piper makes the game kind of boring, since you need to camp her out because you can't get near her relliably if the player is good. But overpowered? Not at all you just need to learn how to play, maybe with Snappy Sniping you would have a fair point but that already got nerfed like 3 times.
---
Me too HAHA!
---
Banana
---
Piper will never be the same
---
Why is it all ways crow lol.
---
Still more capacity than you have xDDD
---
Maybe if you spell it right we could understand you, and second you saying is too complex is complete nonsense, litteraly it would be if they are close: smack, and far away: a normal shot. Simple, Right?
---
It's sad how Darryl is always forgotten by the community. I hope remodel and a voice will make him more popular.
---
OH YE
---
Pretty solid I would say
---
Yea and so was life leech but they took it away because it confused beginners
---
Like the other guy said, reduce the likelihood of getting special points. Otherwise it's a good idea!
---
How would the game detect to shoot a shot or attack with the umbrella
---
Wow,I did the same &lt;&lt;play&gt;&gt; like one month ago vs a Bo and a Rosa !Felt pretty good I have to say!Anyways .....nice play bro üôèüèª‚úäüèª
---
wEaK cOmEbAcK
---
Piper = Witch
---
Hope they add the skin
---
I see it as an absolute win because of that watermark, personally it just gets out there more
---
That change didn't make any sense, I really hope they add it back. Still lifeleech is miles more complex than this, you know why,? Because life leech was a bit complex, whilst this is the simplest thing i've ever heard.
---
Thought that this was what the post was about for a solid minute lmao
---
It's so cool tho
---
It's around 3 or 4 plus you have to be below 4k total trophies. Judging from this person's username he/she is probably using a smurf account and likely fulfils this criteria
---
Wow cool
---
Come one. Your capacity joke was better than this.
---
Just imagine Darryl on here. He's gonna roll over and over again...
---
So having 2 attack buttons is simple? I don‚Äôt think so bc then you couldn‚Äôt tap anywhere on the right side to shoot, but in a small area
---
Darryl's remodel would be great for his birthday(in december). So I think Frank remodel in October, Pam in November and crow in January
---
Oh no, the yellow ring below shelly O_O
