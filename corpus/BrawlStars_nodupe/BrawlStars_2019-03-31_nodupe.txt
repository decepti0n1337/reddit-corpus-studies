Is this true??

If everyone did this everyone would get more trophies. You are a small brawler more often than a big one. Crazy.

this is assuming my post gets to hot though which is too much to ask

holy balls, you guys must be unlucky. Do you have any legendaries??? 
---
**MACHO PUNCH**
---
Even with auto aim wouldnt he have scored
---
I like the overall concept, but the super feels incredibly similar to Spike‚Äôs, it just doesn‚Äôt have the damage. I‚Äôm thinking maybe instead it should be more of a single target freeze? Or idk, maybe like a cone in a direction that freezes enemies hit? But even that feels like a reskin of frank‚Äôs super. I‚Äôm not sure what else it should be, i‚Äôm just throwing things my thoughts out there haha

---
Barley is cooler
---
:/
---
Some basic tips: don't autoaim his normal attack and especially not his super. Lead ur shots with spike. In objective based gamemodes like gem grab or bb, u can use his super to provide area denial to block off any exit areas or throw it on gems or the ball. Spike is op, u just need to learn how to use him well.

so yeah, i spent money on the game -- i also had to wait about a friggen year just for global release
---
It‚Äôs only possible staged.
---
Really like the idea of club war , it can should be cool at a new gamemode slot , and playable  from Monday to Friday , to make a rotation club war/robo rumble , big game ... and fit when a new brawler is playable
---
Also , all the club can play for some rewards (for exemple club war skin look nice) and a evolutionnary brawl box (like a little battle pass you can play every week)

Hope my idea is nice , and sorry if my english is bad

What is a girlfriend

Well the exit button doesn't work 99% of the time so you have probably lost 6 trophies

Jk, teaming is strategy.

Nice, the turret represents thr big game

Nah i need santa mike

Overall it is great but if you want to add lauchpads you could make it more fair

Everything is fine. No problems. I just need to play more to get back to 500.

Bonus as Prison Mike (r/unexpectedoffice)

This is insane. It will break the game

You still haven't edited it.

I think that the first idea is great but the star power would be broken. My suggestion is his super could carry him over water and or walls
---
Lvl 83, trophies 6116 (record 6176), Brawlers 20/24.

Missing Tara and the 3 legendary brawlers. 
---
Holy shit it‚Äôs like literally all of them were gunning after you
---
Remove the tnt and the 1 tile gaps, otherwise supercell won't add, but overall cool map
---
Edit he would be slowly pushed of the water if it ran out

This is way to expensive for 80 you will have 1 big box :/

It can be done, that first, the total damage done to the boss is calculated, and then calculate the damage done by the brawler

"You couldn't open the amount of boxes I opened even if you could open boxes 24h/24 non stop for a month" You talk like you've been playing since 1st day of beta. And there is no reason why anyone can't open more trophies than you. I have 7.5k trophies and got my first legendary at 7.2k. Be more patient. All your posts are about not getting a legendary.

I ****ing know that, what's done is done, I wish I didn't, but I did. Can you now stop repeating the same thing? Thanks. I am waiting everyday and what I get from boxes is: 30 gold, some pp of brawlers that I don't use, and once in a blue moon gems and tickets. I open a big box: pp of brawlers I don't use and gold. I almost never get gems or tickets from big. It's easy for you to say "be patient", but not everyone can be patient for the same amount of time or have the same amount of patience.. It's like you're trying to fill different sizes of glasses with one litre of water. Some big glasses could have all the water in, the smaller ones can't. But I still want to play this game. I know I say all sort of things about the game rng, and I know it's partly my fault I don't have a legendary brawler, but when I see someone with low trophies finding a legendary in a brawl box I think "Why him and not me?" Seems like all the other players are lucky except me.. But no matter what I say you will just keep repeating it's my fault and that I have to be more patient, because you don't understand how I feel.(And by the way yes, I think I have a both gaming and gambling addiction(not slot machines tho), and I'm aware of this, but even if I try to stop I can't, so don't tell me to stop because it won't change anything).

I don‚Äôt know, Fair? Seems like a weird word to use to me. Here‚Äôs why:

1. It‚Äôs an online mobile game.
---
2. It‚Äôs not a tournament/you‚Äôre aren‚Äôt playing for money.
---
3. Perhaps that was a team of people playing together.
---
4. BS, I imagine , wants to make match making as quick as possible. (Check out other mobile games in which wait times are 20+ seconds)
---
Are the teams necessarily even? Probably not, but if that‚Äôs your demand then setting up more competitive play amongst friends is the way to go.

No but its maybie that he found me in leaderboard

In the opponent team there is a 500 trophies colt. Maybe he was playing with his friends (that have very low trophies) and here it is. The game matches you (and your team if you are not playing withh randoms) against brawlers with the same (or similar) amount of trophies of the highest trophy count on your team.

I am in low level(1000+ trophies),so don't have any star powers right now. But won some matches with Jessie as Big Brawler. 
---
Yes(copied)! LOL
---
Oh that‚Äôs why it is at 0.0240
---
That's illegal
---
He can still, you know, bounce his bullets from the floor?
---
So what chance you will be a big brawler 4 time in a row? For a match alone your chance for a big brawler is 1/6. 4 time in a row is 1/6 to the power of 4 = 1/1296. Correct me if I wrong
---
I just wanna get then for free.
---
Lol never notices
---
True, but sometimes it can be useful like if your near your turret and then you see someone and go kill him and then you want to go back near the turret it will be easier to get there, imo its just more helpful for the bear like your getting a box and then you drop him and he starts following someone after you get the power cube it will be easier to find him and know if hes still alive
---
Wait, you have almost 5000 trophies and you are telling me that you have 1 more brawler than me who have 11000?
---
Oh yeah, I do. I know it hits 10 times but it doesn‚Äôt last 10 seconds :P

It was possible to get 8 mins with every brawler back in beta. I got 8 mins using Jessie, because the other team had a few afks.

Its unnecessary.We should get stats after the match that show kills and deaths and etc.

THe fucking teaming is getting out of hand and anoyes me the crap out .
---
Nope. I have been the first brawler but still didn't get it. So my guess is it's totally random and I'm just unlucky. 
---
Idea 2 wouldn‚Äôt work. As said, players at 10k+ are all pretty much max (not all, but most)
---
6 hours tops. Island invasion is perfect for bush hiding 
---
careful he's a hero
---
Why am In ur icon screen 
---
I found that screenshot from 3 months ago and I did not even know how rare it was.
---
oh ok lol
---
I meant figuratively. Bull sucks in bounty. Him and primo almost always are just fodder to brock and piper to get their supers. When the bushes are destroyed later on in the game, he can't do anything at all
---
lmao it‚Äôs literally island invasion and cavern Churn every single day
---
Oh wow, u mainly done in solo sd? But I thought after 400 trophies Shelly is unusable in this map , there are a lot of teamers in the mid (especially Pam) 
---
yeah, sadly i was only using 1 :(

This is such a nice and fitting skin for Frank but tbh nothing can top King Frank because you made it so great.

Why did u censor the name...?was the dyna someone you had in your team and you posted this just for upvotes?

  It‚Äôs not necessary for Tara, but might as well for consistency

Only thing that can hit a flying primo

This is a very nice skin! The Reddit community loves your art and your skin ideas are awesome! I hope Supercell mentions you in Brawl Talk and implements one of your skins in return to your hard work!

No, I‚Äôm not him. I just adopted the name that‚Äôs all.:)

Less bushes and a slightly larger map, like your design will reduce the amount of camping and teaming :)

---
Nice job especially at the front part. Just thinking, those Pams must be quite noob considering they can only land 1 scrap per attack at close range
---
It'll be LEGENDARY map!
---
I really hope they do some mini april fools day event for tomorrow! what do you guys think?
---
Life leech is the best mod and I'm sure everyone misses it. Meteors don't do anything but help teamers destroy the tanker's cover
---

Yes it's true but it's just an idea
---
definitely not frank 
---
Unless you can jump.
---
Exactly what I kept i mind

The center is designed to make teaming even harder

Because it reduces the avaiable space but is still open

Why?

Thankfully hot maze is no longer in the game. Thanks for sharing this strategy!
---
Both Mortis and Jessie spawn Little Friends so...
---
I'm a global player and I miss it
---
I hope it will come back
---
Soooo true
---
This is unfair for the Frank I think they should buff him in big game 
---
It looks cool...... But Supercell said they won't do maps with one tile passages

Phoenix crow looks great

---
I like the map ecause you can usually take a tara, team with lioe 6 people and when  the fog gets close your peircing attack erecks everypne and super too. People who complain are probably low trophies and think bull is a good option... he is in the early game but not late
---
On offense, yea it's pretty good. But in siege brawlers tend to get close, and we all know how piper's like in close range.
---
Oh, didn't catch that. Thank YouüòÅ
---
You are genius :))
---
Nikes!
---
Another genius :))
---
Damn you‚Äôll get there dude. I‚Äôm at 4125 trophies. I got mortis out of a brawl box and leon out of a mega box, just dumb luck. 
---
Oh, Momo is just what I'm called, my real name is Mohammad 
---
Nope, I made this. 
---
Do such small pictures weight a lot?
---
I got Carl the day he came out in my 3rd box I was happy but then realized my chances were smaller 
---
Show me

The shelly in this video named Elite also posted this same video but on his perspective.

THE TITLE IS:- GUY LIKE THIS DESERVES AN AWARD.

No one knew this until someone told this and THIS CREATES A SENTENCE IN THE MIND...it‚Äôs totally SCIENTIFIC!!
---
Oh you are dope it looks official

That makes sense, thanks for your explanation

Really hope this Carl skin gets released

If the boss doesn‚Äôt shoot his boxes down, no one will get to him.

Yeah I can see that, but say your tryna run from someone in de Bush maze, no bueno

And he walks by riding the little cart like a scooter

Why does he look so.... Thin???
---
Until energy drink comes in rotation...
---
espero que lo metan gracias ya que me costo hacerlo.
---
Nice timing
---
Bull is trash, primo is pretty decent in gem grab and brawl ball, frank is great in brawl ball, Shelley is excellent in bush maps and as a close range counter. Pipers star power is great ( I have it), and while I agree pipers super isn‚Äôt that great, it should have a rework so it launches faster and it‚Äôs easier for him to launch backwards, but it‚Äôs still a decent Super to help with repositioning 
---
I REALLY AGREE THIS
---
You have a point
---
Is in app purchases on
---
Pazzesco, un italiano su Reddit
---
He has every brawler in game and at 3900 almost 4k but yet I‚Äôm at 4650 with no mythics or Legendary 
---
Lol
---
tara hits way too hard close range and mid range, gene has the same problem. they can get ult easily and tara can hit 2 targets at the same time almost fully recharge her ult again. gene can get ult easily and grab ppl, theyboth are disgusting ults. its a death sentecne if u get hit by one.
---
I can also do this for other brawlers.
---
Just tell me who should I make
---
She needs a heavy rework.
---
Like...
---
A complete overhaul.
---
The concept is nice and simple the way it is but it just doesn‚Äôt work out ingame. 
---
I dont think tara's super is strong enough to survive even a second offscreen...
---
Exactly
---
# Rigged MM!
---
That's why long range dominates in end game cos middle part of map is wide and u can easily push short range away
---
‚ÄòDefinitely not frank‚Äô like on LOL
---
No need to flex...
---
Uhhhhh what are Mortis and Barley doing
---
Yah
---
Feels bad man. Also a little advice, if you are coloring the background with a single color try to use pastel chalks or pencil dust (the thing that is left after using the sharpener, easier to do, allows for cool background shading, and also doesn't hurt the paper as much as a pencil does keep it up bro :)
---
Pathetic. 19 sec (3 Shelly and 2 bulls) 
---
English please?

I think it would have teaming issues but if you added spring traps this could be awesome

I don't know if it's just me, but why does Leon look like lancer from deltarune

Love how his foot is in Carl‚Äôs minecart. Love your work!

TAROT cards  and jessie is Einstein's granddaughter

Poco is poco adagio which means faster than adagio. its ironic since poco takes forever to recharge ammo

The game mode helps too. The meteors destroy all the walls so you can get clear shots. 
---
Ok - I'll take it on board next time
---
I don't like how posts like these with no effort (no offence) end up with loads of upvotes, but other great pieces of art die in new. Come on r/Brawlstars .
---
WHAM! BAM! HERE GOES PAM! 
---
Stop please this hurts my eyes 
---
nicely done. i might post one of my crow games here someday if i feel like it
---
What if it shows both, but you still have that switch so then the bear can be in front of nita, like it would spin them so then you can see the other behind them and it would be a cooler effect to spin them spin(like how skins spin around in the brawler menu when you want to pick a skin). This would also work with Jessie, Penny, and Pam. Pam‚Äôs heal station doesn‚Äôt sound that cool for this but if the heal station changes when there is a new skin(like a fire hydrant for a firefighter pam skin) then that could be cool.
---
YOUR ACTIONS HAVE CONSEQUENCES. 
---
This is an idea  and yes they did lol.
---
No, if you use the locking thing the attack button is not gonna touch the Super-Attack button and if you have that setting just try to keep distance and do not auto-aim!
---
My best score is 33 bolts
---
i thought bull also means BULLet. bullet get it?
---
LET'S GET SCRAPPY
---
I'm using mobile data and it's pretty good, currently typing this with it.

Gosh, there are so many spike skin ideas and this is just another great idea. The devs will never run out of great skin ideas for spike. He can literally be anything and it would be a great skin idea. 
---
A Subreddit is what we are in right now. It‚Äôs stuff that you are interested in at the moment. If you tap on the Brawl stars icon (The circle) it will take you to the Subreddit :)

His emote and that situationüòÖ
---
üòÇ
---
I know that it‚Äôs not like a tournament or anything, but this was me pushing my bull. I have been on the low level sides trying really hard to push my brawlers and it was just really frustrating to lose to star powers and higher levels
---
I love seeing Frank in Heist or Bounty. Easy pickin's.
---
Yes, they said that many months ago. They ALSO said it recently. The government said murder is illegal many years ago. That was also surely confirmed in some court case today to still be true. Does that mean it no longer applies because it's old? No. Murder was illegal, and it's confirmed to still be. Supercell didn't support #StopTheSpin, and it's confirmed they still don't.
---
Next, you said they are starting to go towards it, that's basically saying they are going towards it. Imagine you're driving down a road to get to destination x. You've "started" to go down that road. You're 1/10th down that road. That's still you going down that road. It doesn't matter if you're just starting to go down the road or have traveled half of the length of said road. You're still going down that road. Your argument here was purely semantics and holds no water.
---
The look how well was clearly sarcasm. How was that not obvious. I'm arguing against #StopTheSpin, clearly I don't support modifiers in line with their intended purpose.

Im impressed by the 1% battery life
---
He look a carl...
---
No wait a frank..
---
No.... **That's a leon**
---
Piper and carl ALSO deserve a buff
---
I would rather have crow that no legendaries lmao and I like crow more than leon and spike...
---
Nope, only viable brawlers are rico, bull and shelly.
---
With that many cactuses, rico would be insane with star power
---
I used remaining 99% battery playing brawl stars, trying to push to 4000... I was only 40 trophies away and this came up...

Where is penny skin ???

Leon should be able to kill Poco

Hell yeah why do they get them legendary ones I can‚Äôt get no one I just got damn dynamike and Carl just now 
---
You want to see the world burn :)
---
Dat name tho
---
And Rico too
---
Idk when have they planned to do it. It is in a few hours tho
---
Try allways to get her super and dont rush to hard. With her Super nothing can kill you in close combat. If you are close to an enemy then first use ur super and afterwards shoot normal ammo. You should be able to get her super back(most of the time) and that's how you basically use shelly also don't waste your super when you know you can't kill that enemy.
---
Title- that's what I call a mastermind level 999999

there should be something like this in showdown, where you can see where your teammate is and stuff

I don't do that because most of those just bush hide for the entire game to get free trophies

The thigh gap...

I don't even have spike yet (R.I.P Me)

Ahh good idea! I like how this gives Carl a bit more strength against close range

This is nowhere on your profile.

I really hope they see this

I would like to, but it ain‚Äôt gonna happen chief

What happens when you push Mortis and Darryl up so high and the rest of your brawlers are so low?

Those are like the only sd maps that Bull and Shelly can be played on.

I think the chick is controlling mike like in ratatouille
---
It's different on Santamike too, the bird has a little Santa hat.
---
BUFF CROW!
---
Worse than Jessie in Nita IMO. That bear is basically a boss
---
Frarl 
---
I don‚Äôt like it because it hinges on your poisoned enemies having to hit people to benefit crow 
---
I also think it‚Äôs over complicated
---
I also quite like Crows star power as it is
---
I am a creature of the sea!
---
My fav anime merged with my fav game lol
---
Awesome 
---
Lmao this really caught me off guard 
---
I like how brawl stars is not toxic, but this is gonna make it be extra toxic
---
Well yes, but actually no. Because then Island Invasion would have even more teaming and more shotgunners. The current Island Invasion is literally such a bad and unbalanced map that it cannot function without meteors.
---
Reduce duplicated  brawlers so will be less lobber teams
---
It's about time we have some stats showing. This is j excellent menu. 
---
Similar??? What? Just starting with the heal, Pam is a slow heal involving time and the turret not dying, and Poco does burst healing. One is area control and one does everything. It's like comparing Nita to Leon, the only thing they share is being super annoying in Showdown. Pam is broken anyway.
---
Crank it up
---
Is crow bad? No. If he good in this current meta? Yes 
---
When you go to the middle there's no back to the other boats (ships).I think that will make Bull happy xD.
---
Right now that's important for determining the star player, I believe. But I think the gems lost are not accounted, so maybe the damage is more relevant.
---
I love how everyone believes Poco does something like 1 damage, until I get a teamwipe. Four hits at at power 9 is close to 4k damage...
---
Great idea. The game could use some QoL
---
Why has this man not been hired yet
---
No teaming at all 
---
 NOOOOOOOOOOOOO (dunno who that is) WHY NOOOOOOOO
