Star power idea: After using its super and for only a couple of seconds, its attacks will be the melee and the ranged one's combined, potentially dealing a ton of damage if the target it's in range of the melee.

Yeah no obviously I'm not not even close to yde's skill

Thanks man, but I beg to differ. I agree that some will break the game, but I have thought about all of these, and thought how they would be used. Give me some examples of pointless ones, and I will tell you why it would be good. Thanks again, and please upvote this, so others will see it.

Penny‚Äôs will be good, if wall are destroyed, so she can use her long range to attack. Crows would be very good, because 50 extra damage, can add 1000 damage, if just a few daggers hit. It would make his damage go up by a ton.
---
There is a pattern, I just forgot what it is

How often does penny's turret hit walls and also that would make the turret worthless
---
Oh no people are gonna accuse me of reposting now because we had similar ideas (look at my profile)
---
lmao, template is on front page
---
r/cursedvrawlstars
---
Piper: an extra bomb would add about 1200 health, and make it harder to get away from her bombs. 
---
Mortis: if you just want to hit to get super, or are just dashing away from a bull or something, it will help a lot. It will increase his survivability. 
---
Crow: damage will be very helpful for killing tanker brawlers.
---
And shells btw?
---
Also crows would not be good since its literally just carrion crow but better so they would have to buff carrion crow then the extra poison would be worthless. crows weaknesses that are bad as a crow main are health and super charge speed, his damage being low I am fine with, a better third star power would be something makes crow super charge faster
---
You could try to upgrade every brawler to max, or save up star points to buy a golden mecha skin. Other than that, there isn't much to do.
---
Should have had your brawlers leveled up first
---
Cool! I really like that design
---
I feel like she would be kinda underpowered with her damage

It realy doesnt tho x) competition starts around 480 imo

If you really hate playing with them, play solo modes or with people you could trust to play well. No point in complaining about it to the kids who roam this sub

r/shittybrawlstars KEEP THE CHAIN GOING
---
Thanks a lot! :D
---
Usable brawlers in graveyard shift included Gene, Crow, Spike, Piper, Colt and all the throwers. So it was more like 8 different brawlers. That is actually surprisingly high amount compared to many normal solo showdown maps where you can always choose Shelly (or Crow if you have one) and get the star token every single time.
---
Yes, Tick was too overpowered and so was Spike. I think the problem with this level was that the brawlers that usually are OP weren‚Äôt it in this level. It makes them angry
---
Right.
---
i still cant get over the fact that a bomb robot killed a 11 year old child. Like he threw a high explosive, he caught it and literally died
---
It‚Äôs the big where in friendly games you can use the super for a different brawler.
---
The autofocus on your camera is never perfect as well. It‚Äôs the same thing. When the situation is ambiguous it may not do what you hope it will do, that‚Äôs all. No algorithm can get it right 100% of the time.
---
That‚Äôs why people do it manually, they have full control. They only use auto in situations when there‚Äôs no way the auto will mess up
---
you start with 2

hey at least crop it a bit and your earlier comment was funny on its own, you didn't need to make it a post.

Gem crab sucks you get 9 gems then you get low hp and some Rosa from the bushes come up and kill you she's running to her spawn base and you have 5 seconds to respawn and then 2 second animation and while running to another spawn 3 seconds left and they win

No, I got permission from the owner, It's just an upgrade I made for his meme. You can check the comments of the original post for proof.
---
You can edit your comment
---
Oh , is that who you wanted?
---
That‚Äôs why I always save 1 or 2 max brawlers at low trophies for star tokens without losing much and push them in the last day of the season
---
Huh? Wdym that was smart of them to ban Mortis. not even giving YDE the chance. It's almost as if to assert their dominance and show who's in control of the game.

you're welcome!

Is this some kind of luck based joke that im to unlucky to understand

They still retain their charm as the characters, great execution :)

Do it. Ignore those comments about not spending money on power points. Just don't be one of those people who upgrade their brawlers balancely, and so they are always lacking money. My brawlers are all power 5 or below, besides the ones I actually use. For example, only my Mortis, Bo, Shelly and Ricoare over power 5. (I used Shelly frequently early on, but I no longer use her.) My Mortis and Bo are both power 8. My shelly is power 7. My Rico is maxed out, but only rank 3. I use Rico in events and power play. I also use Poco frequently, but he is only power 1. Just dote on a few brawlers like me, and you won't be lacking money. I plan to only get Bo, Mortis, and Brock star power and play them until they're all rank 35 before upgrading any other brawler. Just don't upgrade your brawlers as much as possible, only upgrade the ones you use.
---
Wow! Good job on both of them!
---
rico

Or that one random who spins WITH the ball and right infront of the goal before the enemy respawns. And then the enemy primo respawns with his super, wrecking that random.

---
FAQ
---
What does this mean?
---
The amount of karma (points) on your post and Reddit account has decreased by one.
---
Why did you do this?
---
There are several reasons I may deem a post to be unworthy of positive or neutral karma. These include, but are not limited to:
---
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Rudeness towards other Redditors,
---
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Spreading incorrect information,
---
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Sarcasm not correctly flagged with a /s,
---
‚Ä¢      69/420 jokes.
---
Am I banned from the Reddit?
---
No - not yet. But you should refrain from making posts like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your posting privileges in jeopardy.
---
I don't believe my post deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?
---
Sure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.
---
How can I prevent this from happening in the future?
---
Accept the downvote and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on Reddit.com. I will continue to issue downvotes until you improve your conduct. Remember: Reddit is privilege, not a right.

Got here before the comment was posted. This is for Lex‚Äôs challenge, right?

This is very well done.

He litterally showed Patchys account and it had 26k

Wait until all the people fire u back. I pushed 8-bit to 460 just in takedown without using his super(it didn't get charged as I don't attack people)
---
Jesus Christ I know it‚Äôs balancing I didn‚Äôt mean that the star power would be bad, I just meant that the star power had a drawback but the positive effect of it is way more impactful than the negative. Yes it is balancing but it‚Äôs still a draw back in certain situations when you‚Äôre targeting 1 enemy in solo SD. The star power is still really good in 3v3 for more control. There is no other star power in the game that provides a negative aspect in order to balance and I like the idea of that since in this case the positive effect is better than the negative.
---
I have seen this too
---
THIS "SnipesYouOut" DUDE IS SHIT

Which other brawlers do you have with star powers?
---
r/lostedredditors

Justtttt happned with me 2

So frustrating

Just wondering, are the brawl-o-ween skins gone?
---
Nice idea, I would love it to be added in the Chirstmas update! Upvoted :)
---
Good job.How many brawlers?
---
Possible skins?
---
Its the wrong star power glitch. Step 1: Select Star Power you want to use on a different brawler.(e.g. Band-Aid, Ambush) Step 2: Press Select on the brawler selection screen on the brawler you want to use the star power on and very very quickly press Play. If done fast enough, you should be able to use the star power of another brawler on the brawler you chose.(e.g. Bull with Ambush, Mortis with Meteor Rush, Nita with Boosted Booster) This only works in friendly mode.

Thank you for helping me understand exactly what he says

The weird thing is that For some odd reason..a lot of BS players are actually fans of SU..I LOVE IT!!

When you are trying to get a star token:
---
\- in gem grab your random teammate gets 10 gems and starts charging towards enemy base
---
\- in heist no one watches over home base
---
\- in brawl ball someone scores own goals or hides with ball at your own goal
---
\- in solo showdown random Leon decides to use invisibility to you out of 7-8 other brawlers for no reason at all
---
\- in robot hunt everyone shoots at you and not the robot, when you spawn it is always on the other end of the level and when(if) you reach the robot it has shield on. Then someone shoots you
---
\- in bounty hunt (3v3 star hunt) you random teammate goes berserk while you are winning and charges towards enemy until you have lost
---
\- in siege, just kidding no one plays siege
---
\- in graveyard shift you always get star token so supercell thinks this is too easy and takes it away
---
\- in solo star hunt everyone steals all your kills at the last moment
---
I think Nita would say that since she is older
---
i see this as an absolute win
---
Cat bombs. Hands. Serial killer.
---
"OH HO"
---
But 1 ticket is about half boxes
---
How can you even get in the bushes
---
Yeah but nita calling leon a brother is better than leon calling nita a brother
---
Amazing!
---
... what an idiot.
---
Wow i can't even see what im writing here,you're such an idiot to waste that time just for a replie that makes no sense just because you didn't laughed or liked it. You have all the time in the world just to do an replie like that. I needed to edit my comment to see anything other than this bs i'm seeing. You're just mad because you got rickrolled. And what? Gonna cry to your mom? Huh?
---
Honestly hyperbear is not as powerful as Bear with me. Especially considering what Bear With Me can do against boss robots (hint: cannot die unless rockets start spawning). With a coordinated team, Nita getting her Super with Hyper Bear could mean a victory (you'll need Dynamike or someone who gets his Super quickly to constantly reset the boss when he tries to shoot).
---
Sandy is not "Leon on steroids". His Super doesn't really synergize with his attack, since he isn't an assassin. And the fact that it's just an area is very limiting. Compare that to Leon's Super, which is slightly less versatile because it only works on him, but he can go wherever the hell he wants in 6 seconds (especially with his first Star Power), and he is actually able to kill someone while using it.   
---
Basically Sandy's Super is more for regrouping your team, and occasionally escaping (though it is still predictable where they'll escape because limited range), while Leon's is for assassination and occasional escape.
---
Honestly, the only Supercell game where exp is relevant is Clash Royale. Otherwise, I just stopped paying attention to it in their games. And the trophy road is all right too.

Thanks, my day is complete now.

Thx anyways

I don't know, but if you have all the brawlers except the legendary ones, the percentage of chances that you have it's pretty high
---
No prob bob

Damm,soo many views this cluckbaiter got...why!!!

U need bull to be at full range, so NOPE! Doesnt change anything

How do you do it?

Who &amp; where is their mum anyway?

This is a drawback, you deal less damage in exchange for double hit, el fuego just deals extra damage

I hope so, but actually, iam pro without any legendaries,when I was 3000 trophies, I had 49 boxes, and I've opened them, I got amortis,Tara, Carl and Rico

Ya veo pues un momento

Summary: You don't know how to play Insane+, nor do most commenters, which explains why I get so many mind-numbingly bad random partners.
---
Colt gets all of the power cubes, because he's got the speed and the range to avoid most attacks right up until the boss hits God level, and he needs the extra hitpoints to survive the rest and do damage faster. Leon shouldn't be playing at all unless you think dying is a good strategy - apparently you do.  It's hilarious that anyone thinks Jessie is even remotely useful for Insane+, and pretty much proves you haven't played that far.

This is not a bug or something. With you saying you're at 16,5K, you should know that. This happend because the other 2 players on your team were in the same lobby, and the game matchmakes based on the highest brawler of the team.
---
Isnt it obvious that I typed it anyway?
---
Estoy se acuerdo contigo, por eso mortis es un brawler para equipo. Por ejemplo, digamos que un carl te ataca cuando eres mortis y el tiene su super. No lo puedes matar. Ahi tienes un shelly con su super en tu equipo y ella usa su super cuanso carl usa su super para cancelarlo y ahora ya mero muere. Ahi lo mata mortis. Una cosa mas
---
Nunca uses a mortis en solo

thanks! :D

i like this idea, team modes (ik this is duo but still) have a lack of communication and this seems like a solid solution for it
---
thank god he didnt get his hat removed
---
thank ya! :))
---
Which one?
---
Kinda. It's one of the best ways to get your favorite brawler up to 9. Trophy Road isn't sufficient and you can't rely on the shop cuz of gold.
---
But there ARE better ways to spend your gems if you're f2p. Basically it's $3.
---
I checked and i finished it on october the 6th playing since global
---
U have a major disablity for saying no hat mortis is bad. Just look at that epic, clean hair. Oooh its awesome. Also ppl like no hat mortis so shhhh
---
Same
---
Yea, star points are reward for trophy, not for the quest, i think.
---
Since similar categories are mainly subjective, for example for me Jessie is good in all events, a brawler should be buffed only if its usage percentage is much lower than the average.
---
Thats better than all of my art combined
---
power play is dumb af honestly

it looks like you‚Äôre trying to make a super made up story be written by someone else, why the hell otherwise would you write it in the in game chat when you can text post your ‚Äústory‚Äù

If everyone deals 0 damage to the boss of course

Yes!

You compete these quests easily while playing and earn additional rewards

It can push players to play in different game modes, not only in showdown for example.

Oof. Idk if its a bug or something or they took it away cuz i dont play too much takedown.

Oh ok, thx

Agree. What I think should happen is if an X percent of votes say that it‚Äôs a punishable offense then it should go to supercell where they make the final decision.

Your one extra orb that splits off deals less damage so outside of that Jessie plays like she would normally. In a 1v1 she is not becoming worse due to the star power
---
I think that this should be a 10k star point skin not a 150 gems one
---
aha i actually draw sans a lot which is probably why they kinda morphed. thanks!
---
Emz‚Äôs second sp would be hilarious in showdown. I could just imagine someone trying to heal up on the other side of the map and then boom.
---
I reposted this because, like the title above, I made some changes to these ideas of 3rd Star Powers. Now again, I am not the best at making up ideas like this, because like I said before, this is the first time I ever posted an idea on this subreddit, or any other one. So please, no hate or harsh criticism towards me. I honestly couldn‚Äôt think of anything else that is unique when I post things.
---
It‚Äôs one of those things when you think your idea(s) sound better in your mind or seem terrible to you, but that‚Äôs how it goes, I guess.
---
Good, anakin good, what I‚Äôm trying to say is that I like itüëçüèº

Grind the boxes and big boxes. If you want to spend money buy mega boxes

Lol, that's some really good art!
---
If the mom was a brawler in the game who do you think it will be?
---
Hold up
---
That isn‚Äôt a drawback indeed, I must have read it wrong
---
Why did you post this if he posted it here and you obviously stole it?
---
Wow so true  lol

they have layers

The concept is unappealing

Then you have to move your thumb really far up that could block even more visibility

Thanks ive been on fire with these 4 posts currently and think this is enough ideas for now but if you have anymore ideas to give that would really save me time

---
Thanks man I forgot to add BS to it. Thanks for explaining it to them though!
---
Theoretically he should be decent, since his base damage and hit points are only a little lower than Colt's, and he has a high-damage super.  But his projectiles have a wider spread, and even with the Robo Retreat star power he's going to be slower than Colt except when he's in trouble. His most useful aspect over Colt or Pam is the ricochet of his projectiles, and that is of little use for this event.
---
When I've seen Rico in action he's one that's dying a lot, even early in the game. His extra speed only kicks in when he's at 40% or lower hit points (less than 1500 for a L10 Rico with no cubes), so he's likely to die regardless of the resulting speed boost, or before it even kicks in, as many boss attacks do 2000+ damage.
---
If he's on a team with Colt, he should avoid cubes and be in a support role, although failure is likely since he's too vulnerable without cubes. If there's no Colt, he MIGHT be the best choice to substitute for the Colt and take the cubes to damage the boss - but this is theoretical, as I've never seen him perform in this role.
---
But generally I wouldn't recommend bringing him to a random team, since getting paired with a Colt is very common, and Rico won't be a good choice in a supporting role due to dying a lot.
---
Way to poor to get it but I would want it.

BIBI (DUH DUH DUH DUH DUH DUH DUH DUH) ROLL THE WHEEL

You actually can‚Äôt only in friendly games
---
Here's the thing giving a brawler an op star power doesn't make the brawler good so that's why I think nerfing Piper's damage just because she has a very powerful star power isn't right idea or in Reverse for Nita or Leon especially true for Leon due to the fact he has three or four seconds of invisibility so when you first unlock the brawler they're basically useless
