just get ur super, ur leon, stop complaining 
---
Carbon Fiber or Shade (Shadow?) 
---
I have dynamike but I only have like 500 trophies how is this possible? I played the beta when the game was only on Android is that why?
---
Some people have even gotten mythics and legendaries in the same box. It's all luck
---
This is so sad.
---
Nah I couldn't even two shot a 1 power daryl at point blank, I just got him so he's level 1 tho
---
its so funny seeing ppl making fake accounts to do this because they dont have the balls to do it with there real account.
---
Congrats man
---
I love your concepts but I would have to say you should make some adjustments to your brawlers to be a little bit more balance. I‚Äôm on my phone so I‚Äôll be doing multiple posts!
---
1. Chief sounds really polished already, I especially love the chained attacks which slightly reminds me of LeBlanc from League of Legends, but reverting back the the original start. The only bad part of this move though is that, aside from his attacking, he really has no mobility, if you think about it. I think it should be able to dash, just like Mortis but maybe the more enemies he goes through, his dashes do a bit more damage than the previous or doing less damage, stacking up to three times (ammo). After he hasn‚Äôt attacked an enemy for 3 secs, the buff resets. 
---
His Super sounds OP, just because the wolves have 2,500 hp while Tara‚Äôs super with her star power makes it so her clone has 2,000 HP. I would make it that the wolves are very fast in mobility but having around 700-1000 HP doing close range damage.
---
Chief‚Äôs Star Power is awesome, keep it the way it is, or the wolves, when casted on an area does minuscule damage but also slows anyone in the certain radius for 1 second! 
---
I love you both
---
nobody likes darryl
---
or just play leon and dont be bad like this guy
---
Damn I always knew android users couldn‚Äôt spell üòÇ

Thank you mate. :)

---
No I'm saying literal children don't need to be exposed to this shit lol
---
People who have all brawlers save boxes so when a new brawler releases they can get it faster
---
Oh ok makes sense ty
---
Waiting for new content. Got all the PowerPoints, but gold is missing. Imo it‚Äôs not worth opening all the boxes tho. 
---

Yep üëç 
---
That's the Brawler's trophies, not the player's.
---
Please god no
---
At least two? Got it
---
Mi piace un bordello
---
Darryl is so much fun to play in brawl ball. You can use the super to dribble the ball and if your entire team just died you can use it to roll in front of the goal to save the ball
---
Oh okay
---
2. As for Shade, I love the concept of the reverse cone animation attack, it bring some plays and diversity to the game itself. I also imagined the attack animation perfectly. What if Shade Although shoots out an orb that does little to no damage, but when it comes back to Shade, the damage is more significant when it is returning back to the caster, similar to Ahri‚Äôs Q, in league of legends minus the initial damage Ahri has when she shoots her orb out. 
---
Super is fine, just the way it is, or it could be similar to Brock‚Äôs Super yet it is more bigger slow moving orb that once it reaches the top of the max tile, it explodes? 
---
As far as his Super with the 1.5x more damage sounds nice but it should be more where you can switch that debuff on another character, very similar to Zenyatta‚Äôs Discord, from Overwatch. 
---
Also Bo‚Äôs star power is really OP for cavern churn
---
I disagree. P2W means paying money to become stronger than F2P players. This could be items or other power ups that are unobtainable through F2P progression.
---
In Brawl Stars however, paying for loot boxes can be compared to buying an EXP boost. That's not P2W, it's a matter of speeding up progression. Some of the best Brawl Stars players are entirely F2P, and it's possible to max out your account for free.
---
Yeah and someone can reach 11k in a couple of weeks is that right? Plus it just means he‚Äôs skilled if he‚Äôs lvl 7 above 500 trophies, I don‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs your concern here
---
I‚Äôve been having horrible lag after that centurylink outage, that may be due to the outage though.
---
No god please 
---
No
---
God please no
---
NOOOOOOOOOOOOO
---
Lol 
---
No. At higher trophies they are mediocre and not versatile, they aren't good
---
Well, you are facing people at a lower level, especially since you just unlocked Bo (by the sounds of it). All characters feel that way at first if you have experience with the game.
---
Ni√±o, no puedes publicar en Espa√±ol. Tuve que reportarte
---
Shoot I just thought about the lol. I still think he could be a good support brawler 
---
what glitch?
---
Yeah but it's super infrequently an event
---
Dynamike spamming his aoe bombs in a small area is supposed to be impressive?
---
Primo and bull needs buff
---
Yeah. Main thing though with him is the Star Power. If you're wanting to push Bo, that's the first thing you need lol. Easy 500 trophies to be honest (at least if it's a map with a lot of bushes).
---
Saved.  Enjoyed immensely, reread.
---
Removed - This is an English speaking subreddit, characters not in the English language have been detected in your title. This may have been caused by emojis.

Without star Power, he is bad. You are at low trophies, obviously he will seem good against bad people. He needs a huge buff and a nerf of his star power.
---
Also, he sucks at Heist, he makes no sense there (no, the mines in the box aren't that good). He is decent at Gem Grab, and maps with a lot of grass
---
Maybe i will try next time
---
Pff I stayed hidden the whole match and the last last second before he walked into me he hit super and killing  himself "bull" in the gas lol

You lost it. Any knockback will make you lose it if timed well. That's why Shelly, Bull, Darryl and Primo are amazing Frank counters, because their supers can stop his super. Basically, don't play Frank in this map lol

No you match against people around your brawlers trophy lvl (for example if your bull is 200 trophies u match with other people who's brawlers are 200 trophies
---
I thought he was gonna use mike's star power and blast his way outta there. Nice job tho
---
The proper saying is ravioli ravioli never lewd the lol 
---
Don‚Äôt know exactly, but they definitely did it better than when it was in beta though. During beta there was no way of knowing your legendary chance.
---
I mean 100% of the damage, but where the bullets bounce back, and it would be relatively easy to dodge. If u r talking about at close range like bulls, I was thinking of adding something that decreases damage as you get closer in range. Also, for pyro, I made an individual post on her. If u want to check that out, it has a lot of changes, and it may change your feedback.
---
He‚Äôs.... already a policeman though
---
Well you have to wait for them to release the beta for whatever game they make in the future. Just follow supercells social media 
---
That‚Äôs only 2 losses lol
---
What about crow

SPIKE!
---
I always tend to be in the middle of the action and get rekt in the middle or get teamed on, even if I choose to team they‚Äôll eventually find an area to kill you, go for the cubes after someone dies and theyll all choose you as the next target, does the same happen to you?

Hey Nico it's Roman.

I guess since he's classified as an assassin I feel he needs better burst damage, since right now he plays like a support. Perhaps more daggers on his normal attack would be good.

Ya, eventually you just learn the tricks of running past people and pitting others against each other instead. There are many times when I get 8-10th because I get cornered by two people. I prefer not to team because I become paranoid they will stab me in the back.

They just need to add more Maps with fewer Bushes and few walls so that long range Brawlers can dominate there, like Piper, Bull and Primo don't need a nerf, existing maps makes em Dominant.

I like this. This is the pire beauty of what humanity can create. This is a masterpiece long to be found within history and will be known for how beautiful it is.

It's supposed to be the old brawl stars theme. It took me a while to realise that.

Lag? So my connection issues no matter what WiFi I‚Äôm on isn‚Äôt my own fault? I‚Äôve been el primo‚Äôd multiple times thanks to my perfect connection somehow not being good enough. I am very far from the best but well above average and I win top player 7/10 times on average but thanks to the lag I‚Äôm well below average lately. Losing 8 trophies for every 10 I earn. 
---
good idea 
---
If you grinded everyday since beta launch you would definitely have all brawlers that you have at level 10, especially if you haven't been wasting any gold on leggies.
---
Low key Pam is just Bull undercover

Am I fine? My alt accounts name is EAT ASS. I don‚Äôt know if it is offensive or not. Definitely not as offensive as the above account.

Omagudness it's true!

Boxes are not that hard to get. 4 star tokens + normal tokens, is about 300 tokens per day, which is 3 boxes a day.
---
Barley it is haha
---
it would not be power 1 bulls or 3k trophies, but instead how many trophies your bull has.
---
I‚Äôm lost with so many average words but if you are talking about delay no matter what connection you are using, yes, that‚Äôs a thing and it‚Äôs bothering everyone

Use that to your advantage to get away if you‚Äôre stuck in a tight situation

Since in the video No Time To Explain there is some paper with Bull's face and the word "Wanted", probably.

This is an example of how to slowly progress in the game.

Is that a reference to a joke about the TF2 dev team? If so, I love it!

Pekka is in clash royale too. Its a 7 elixir tank with incredibly high damage single target attacks.

Why?

yeah ive done this before and still do it when i dont bush camp with bull in showdown
---
I‚Äôll start with Nita being a furry.
---
Only a matter of time before some spicy brawl stars fan fic
---
you mean remodel, because rework and remodel mean two completely different things
---
I feel so bad for you. If anything, you deserve to be one of those people that get back to back brawlers in 1 box.
---
put a heart above the "cousins" \*wink\*
---
I MISSED THIS POST HOW DARE I
---
But really though I loved being a part of somethinf and glad to have contributed to another collab!!! Everyones part completes each other!!!!
---
Bull is extremely strong on a lot of the showdown maps, especially the current one "gulch." I prefer the larger showdown maps over the smaller ones because the smaller ones are always dominated by bull. When I first started I wish I knew to check bushes more often. I think solo and duo are both good, I like duo but sometimes if I'm having bad luck with partners in duo I switch over to solo. I suggest that when you log back into the game after playing showdown or heist, the default map should be the mode you last played on if it hasn't expired yet instead of just automatically going to gem grab everytime since sometimes you go on muscle memory and accidentally play gem grab when you didn't mean to. Quality of life improvements are typically the most important for games like this.
---
I see your point but shouldn't the 80% decrease of damage received make up for it? Like old Darryl star power u could bizarrely deal damage to him when he used his super
---

As someone who plays Nita and Primo a LOT, this is almost always true

Oh so bull is Vietnamese?!

Nice transformers
---
As a new player I thought he was very weak at first but I realized I was playing him completely wrong and now that I realize how to play him he‚Äôs op!
---
Now that's a lot of damage!

Ricochet did get a score of 3 out of 18 which was the lowest

All the level packs are if you have the money

Sure thing. Why not, but i am Brand New to the game‚úåÔ∏è starte on global Release. I have 1700 cups... 
---
any loot box system that uses real money transactions to achieve a rare reward is p2w

Yes, offers come up for legendaries sometimes
---
Are These lvl Packs coming back to the Shop like they did in Clash Royale when u missed them? 
---
I‚Äôm so pissed tho lol I would‚Äôve spent more than $30 US on the game and I only have all rare brawlers and a singular super rare brawler penny and I‚Äôve been playing a month before global release. A friend I have started the game a week before global release, has spent no money on the game and has unlocked all rare, super rare and a mythic brawler mortis. It makes me so pissed lol. üòÇ
---
But I think without getting to know the other brawlers, learning to attack could take more time
---
Noooo I just spent 50 on token doubler cuz I said ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no point in waiting for a mythic in the shop‚Äù
---
The cool down is too long
---
I‚Äôm also new 1920 trophies
---
Level packs are the best offers at lvl 5 for $2, lvl 15 for $5, lvl 25 for $10, and lvl 35 for $20. Best $37 you'll spend. Period.

Go and get that mythic brawler then.

---
Cool idea but then Supercell would have to add an emblem for every 100 trophies and it would get a bit out of control.
---
Welcome to Brawl Stars!
---
That wouldn't work well when you unlock a new brawler. You get a fresh new brawler and can't even play with it until you level it up a few because everyone else is playing much higher level than you. It wouldn't feel good.

We ended up winning, the last team had 8 each but Dynamike is op haha

*****PLEAS3 READ*****HEY!!! maybe that caught ur attention, some may know if u have all brawlers in a rarity category in the shop to purchase a brawler it will change for no dupes. But I'm questioning if that no dupe will go lower for a brawler. For example say there are 2 mythic brawlers in the shop and I have one mythic brawler. Say I have one more epic I need and 3 legendaries, will it demote the mythic for purchase to a epic or promote it to a legendary, I dont know how to put it but if u understand what I'm trying to say, thanks! :)
---
I know, I was just joking :) 
---
Buy keys doublers or tickets to maximize your account. Wait for offers to buy new brawlers. 
---
Yeah i think that since I play since the start of the game they give me more importancy
---
Lol never expected

Piper should be with Rico

Oh boi im dumb

I don't see much sense on this idea, but it is appreciated

I am sure you can come up with a nice Family Tree as well as me.
---
Just got mythical in shop for 256 gems
---
i mean it won‚Äôt necessarily get you in a game faster, you still have to wait for queue anyways, it would only save time if there happened to be a queue that filled up in the fraction of time between clicking the queue alone button and simply exiting and clicking play, which is at most a few seconds
---
The only thing I'm missing here is a pet.
---
Happened to me too

I understand, sometime movies goes that way and we don't expect that. But from the point of view of producers think People would go on the theatres to see stunning visuals and Cgi. So they might know focus on the acting and story plot. Which is definitely not true and audience would expect all three to be perfect in the movie. Here in Our cinema industry many new concept films with Heavy Vfx and cgi were released and it was a crucial part for new market hunt, The all films Unfortunately failed from the Acting and Weak plot side. The trick may not work anymore and People these days are getting more aware so they want to see such movies with a strong plot and acting, would be more grateful if they focus on social issues, vfx and cgi would enhance the experience of viewing but that's not a support stand for movies to survive box office. Just shared my perception.

Started at Android release, 17/22...
---
rework?
---
Keep going! Managed to get El Primo done at Skull Creek (solo SD). Good luck with Leon. 
---
Robo rumbo a ticketed event need 350 trophies to unlock
---
When he gone invisible i got scared.üò£
---
El Primo is actually Shelly‚Äôs Cousin! What a coincidence!
---
El Primo = The cousin 
---
Instagram is definitely a trash part of the internet
---
All rarities can come to the shop 
---
So I don't need the other rarities to get this, its just luck if I get the daily offer or not? 
---
Salty
---
yep, everytime I end up 10th in a showdown it's because I got too greedy around Primo.
---
Didn't he give u credits? 
---
You have no idea how happy I am that you referenced soundsmith
---
YesüòÉ
---
Should you keep all your characters around the same trophy level? I guess I can‚Äôt figure out if match making is done on a character‚Äôs trophy level or the players trophy level all up...
---
Ye , i wish there was a leon in his place tho
---
;)
---
Leon: \*walks into bush\* Shelly: \*shoots bush, hits nothing\* Shelly: \*screams\*
---
Oh ya i forgot
---
Yes, not bad)
---
Time to get a new girlfriend
---
Gonn need it
---
It‚Äôs just showing how many new players we really have
---
U first :)
---
I have, can I just play it anytime if i have tickets? cus I can't find it.
---
Don't know:(
---
I would save for chef mike unless you play Brock/Bull more
---
What are you complaining about? 300 GOLD! Its totally worth it to push for that reward! üôÉüôÉüôÉüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Thanks üôè 
---
Also Jessie: die because you‚Äôre around the wall trying to recover, but your teammate decides to run close to you but not behind the wall so her shot bounces to you. 
---
Anyone else instantly think of David Attenborough talking about something like this?
---
There will be three gamemode Big game, robo rumble and boss fight they both refresh each weekend
---
I‚Äôm not home and I need to use cellular to browse reddit
---
Pc browsing for a  reason to insert witty comments in a conversation 
---
Okay thanks :)
---
Dont be so salty
---
Bug
---
I think the post is wrong because when you have 10 gems you should go back to your base and survive
---
My friend got leon at 250 trophies at the same day when the update arrived. Not even salty...
---
Me2
---
Thanks captain obvious, your job her is done
---
Reminds me of Junkrat from Overwatch and HOTS
---
Because he's already dead?
---
I don't know if I can share the  **360¬∞** image directly to reddit and you guys can just look it without click into the link.
---
Can anyone teach me? I am new to reddit. This is my first post .
---
Lmao
---
I'm in that same boat.
---
And the final boss would be ~~Dr. Wily~~ Dr. Bull-y
---
Sorry bro this map won‚Äôt work. You realise most of the heist maps have zig-zag patterned walls? They block people from picking long range brawlers to gun down the melee brawlers, making it hard to dodge. 
---
A real response please.
---
Exactly! I really hope they do something about this. I also hope that they make it less rewarding to only play one brawler and make it more rewarding to play all your brawlers.
---
Unfortunately playing gem grab with ransoms is a sad time
---
Im king
---
Dev
---
Your phone isn‚Äôt the issue most likely. I play on an iPhone XS Max with FIOS quantum WiFi and I lose multiple matches cus of lag but it might be happening to others too cus one time I lagged so bad that the entire match timer ended and I wasn‚Äôt killed once which means no one else was able to get to where I was. 
---
When you look the bag of dynamike you can see a mini-ricochet inside it, easter egg? :0
---
He's almost useless if he doesn't have his star power
---
And then teaming with bosses appear...
---
That wasn't my point. If a bull primo or Darryl are on your tail it's almost impossible to throw at your feet, so anyone's normal reaction would to be spamming aurofire at a chasing bull. Don't take my words out of context please. And even if you manage to throw on your feet luckily they will just tank the damage and kill you anyways because they will outpace you and 2 shot you in range. 
---
If I remember you can still drag and use it at the black part
---
Thank you 
---
Shooting at your feet with a thrower is nearly impossible with throwers what was he supposed to do?
---
Thx
---
Shooting at your feet is nearly impossible with throwers 
---
Cool idea, but it could create a problem prominent in other customisable loadout games. Essentially, it could lead to confusion about what super a brawler has. Currently if you see a Bo, you always know what his super is. This system will leave you guessing whether a Bo has mines or an arrow storm, and as a result consistency is lost.
---
this made me feel uncomfortable
---
There is one people with 106 while all the others are only at 104 and 105. This is unacceptable Supercell, please fix your matchmaking, it's so unfair!! &gt;:(
---
It is not impossible,with auto-aim it is.
---
Nope. It's very possible to do so. Infact, he didn't even need to shoot at his feet, just a simple nudge upwards would have done the job
---
It do be like that
---
I just tell my friends that Leon sucks and spike is better setting them off int he right direction :)
---
I like the idea of other "talents" but actually it would be a mess. and btw dynamike star power is amazing if you are able to do some tricks.
---
You see people calling black people monkeys every day here?
---
I tested on my sister moto G and is working, battery saver is way better than any app that improve performance hahaha. Hope that helps :)
---
Look, lets do a little bit of math: with those 269 gems, you can buy two times the 80 gem tickets and two times the key doubler, leaving you with 2000 key doublers and a f**k ton of tickets. With those 269 gems, you can do all that, do the robo rumble with a team and get at least 50, 60 brawl boxes. About the luck of getting epics, the chance gets higher but not to a worth ammount, specialy if you want the legendaries. My opinion, but, with you buy Tara, you will loose a lot of gold, power points and possibly other brawlers. If you not buy her, you still get a chance of unloking her, but also have a chance of getting Pam (really strong in the meta), Frank (also really good) and Piper (not that good in the meta, but she dominates in bounty). 
---
In randoms, if you found your team mates to be good, hit play again, and friend them later. This way, you can play with them later. (Also you will be put in matches where your team mate has a rank 15 shelly but doesn't play any other brawlers.)
---
Unfortunately I have the commons one, Pocho and El Primo. Nothing else
---
You definitely can get higher without playing with friends. I‚Äôm at 9,000 trophies playing exclusively with randoms. There are others that are even higher than I am. Sure you‚Äôll lose thanks to a bad teammate sometimes but overall this just sounds like an excuse for not looking at your own play
---
That‚Äôs HUGE man! Well done!!!!‚Äô
---
WHAT YOUR FRIENDS HAVE 17 AT 1200??? 
---
You'll get the super rares sooner or later as they are relatively common. I'm still trying to get the other 2 epics and I have Mortis as mythic. I'm at 16 brawlers at 4.4k by 2k you should have at least 12 brawlers
---
Heil Germany
---
if you are a fairly new player, spend it on token doublers, however if you get event tickets you have to get a very high time on robo rumble consistently.
---

---
Congratz on tara
---
Could you be more specific on what the game mode will do? What is the objective? How many players?
---
She plays like a less-tanky El Primo without being in bear form, so people have unreasonable expectations. They seem to forget how squishy she is in human form.
---
When you have no short term memory
---
Solution: Don't play with randoms
---
It‚Äôs the other way around for me, but that‚Äôs probably just because of my bad WiFi
---
Charges a lot faster if you can hit multiple daggers. Just gotta be good at strafing, and no auto attacks.
---
Why so extra?
---
Not if you stop to make that system at 700 trophies
---
It would just be more difficult to have your brawler 700 than it is to have him 500 now
---
Thanks for your opinion, I really like the first part about playing with random. A similar thought could be on the teaming in solo showdown and the psychology and strategy behind it.
---
What I don't understand is the second part with the hate in the "p2w" aspect of bs. If you spend money it gets you faster to max, which would only take little more then a year without spending. What's the advantage of maxing out power through buying gems and offers? They need the same amount of skill as everyone else with maxed  brawlers (also they're lacking allot of practise) and still they would only match with people of the same brawler trophy range.
---
There are lots of games where the actual game starts only after being maxed out...obviously starcraft, league of legends,...are none of them. 
---
Does the fact that there are some competitive games you can actually play competitive on a fresh account make all the other games non-competitive games?
---
Don't buy brawlers with gems. It isn't worthy
---
Indeed. Also, I like how El Fuego turns him into a ridiculous pseudo-Barley.
---
It‚Äôs really hard to do it intentionally, I tried it after and took me a lot of tries 
---
Do not run away!
---
I played 2 bounty games in a row, I got match up against lester mo and other pros above 600 trophies per brawler, and the other match against more 550 and above, all 4 of my teammates were below 2500 total trophies whil al the pros were above 12k (I'm at total of 10k and my brawler had 460 trophies.
---
So teaming up with somebody is way better now than before. (especially if you are a pro)
---
Lol, i know the feeling. One time i was with my 300 trophies penny, playing bounty, and then, all of the sudden, i got to play against Tin Tin (one of the best players in the game), he was playing Bo (with star power) and had like 800 trophies, and his team had like 600. It was so unfair man, i just laughed at the situacion.
---
hell yesss
---
So many times people take screenshots of something they got from a box and you dont know what kind of box is that.
---
Good Point.
---
Well tank are countered by anyone that has range on them,unless u use auto aim only.
---
Maybe you shouldn't have made a line graph...
---
So then what do I buy? Mega boxes or double points? 
---
&gt;However, in my opinion my skill doesn't matter anymore; it now solely depends on my teammates rather than my actual skill.
---
So.. It depends on both your skill AND the skill of your teammates? Wow! It's almost like their individual people having their own experiences in this TEAM ORIENTED game. Weird! 
---
Man, that's amazing, I really like the idea and the design. It's very exhaustive to grind trophies above 500 right now, I put a lot of brawlers at 600 trophies countless times.
---
Yeah thanks for the concern but I think I messed up quite a bit, thx for your support man
---
Yeah that always worked for me. When i get the 10 gems i just run to the closest Bull i can find 
---
100% right . The problem is that they push their brawlers to 300-400 and higher by camping and teaming in solo showdown. Then you get matched with them because of the brawler trophies and they have no clue how to play 3v3 gamemodes. 
---
Fortnite mortis
---
Too many boxes wtf
---
Kind of the same thing with me, 9k with 18 brawlers all 500s and there‚Äôs nothing to do
---
I feel you I just tilted my Tara and i'm now raging.#relatable.
---
There‚Äôs REALLY too little lore going around. No concrete evidence for anything. For all we know it might simply a few random individuals here to slap each other. The only few confirmed points we have is that 
---
1. Pam and Jessie belong to the ‚ÄúJunker‚Äù family, and by extension, Penny.
---
2. Spike is the last of his kind and hence cannot be related to anyone.
---
3. El primo is likely to be cousins with another brawler
---
4. Crow ‚Äúshowed up one day‚Äù and hence also cannot be related.
---
5. Mortis is the fastest spook in the west
---
*insert image*
---
As it stands, there‚Äôs no evidence that dynamike is the head of the family. Besides that, the robot brawlers are likely to either be created by the junker family(in which case, they should not be fighting Jessie/Pam/Penny). Or if they aren‚Äôt, we cannot tie them to any family tree.
---
There is also no evidence to prove piper as any part of the family, or Friendship between characters in any way. The game either needs to get up to speed with lore(in death VO‚Äôs where characters react differently to being killed or killing certain enemies) Or just in game text, or even a single player mode that could have some lore reveals. But Supercell, being ever unkeen on lore, is likely to leave it as it is.
---
Thxx!!!
---
I think they should slow Brawlers down instead of freezing them
---
I need three legendaries.Pls SuperCell.

Terrible English btw but yeah

Sounds like low sample size and confirmation bias. Supercell is not out to get you specifically

It is called strategy. don't make this sub toxic please. Think what your mother would say cuz I am that mom.

If someone is spinning, they are taunting you so kill them immediately.

but that‚Äôs over a dollar worth in gems, considering you get the cheapest gem pack

Is that what they're trying to get? I always thought they were 5yo or something lol

Practice with it. When u get good, u can successfully do it most of the time in a battle

I hate to be that guy, but chameleons don't change colour for camouflage...

Even 10 games with low level players is horrible. This has nothing to do with confirmation bias. I understand supercell isn't out to get me. There should be a fix for this. It is messing with peoples ranks and stopping players from having fun.
---
Thank you! I'm going to keep it up and stay faithful to the woosh.

Aww if crow wasn‚Äôt so toxic (pun intended) and got rid of those daggers he‚Äôd actually be really cute

Thank you! I freaked out when I saw my skin Idea in Coach Corry's video. :O

I remember they came on saturday with the special event but i dont see them very often too so i think they might be gone

Geez you‚Äôre still getting downvoted. Turns out there were more nine year olds in the player base than I thought...

It doesnt decrease if you get them from trophy road or you buy them directly from the shop ;)

---
What is this? Fortnite mortis? Get this sh*t out of here
---
Not sure... I just hit 3K this morning and unlocked Bo, obviously at power 1.
---
If I was to constantly get matched against players with total 3K trophies and therefore brawlers around power level 4 / 5, I'd never bother using Bo until I've got enough power points to level him up first. I just don't see how I'd stand a chance.
---
Long finger boi
---
it's just a game why you need to be mad
---
Oh yeah for sure I know i'm still fresh off the boat myself just having started at global haha.  I was just being salty because my buddy got both of those like practically right out of the gate.  I was that guy that started Clash Royale from global launch as well and was like the last one I know to get a princess so i'm not holding my breath lol.
---
If a reward from supercell feels any better than a punch to the dick the world is probably ending
---
She‚Äôs a keeper 
---
I-uh think he broke his neck
---
This map could definitely work for melee brawlers as long as you have a good comp. I think it‚Äôs a good idea
---
That would mean ridiculously long queue times, because very few people at 9,000 trophies have level 1 brawlers. One of my favorite things about this game is how quickly I can find a match. It is not realistic at all to place multiple requirements like that into matchmaking, this will not and can not happen
---
I have a couple of questions for you, if you don't mind, since you are a long-time player and I have only played since global release.
---
1. Is it feasible for a F2P to max out characters?
---
2. If the answer to the first question is "yes", do you know how long it would take?
---
I only have a few players at Power 6 and I have been curious. Would appreciate your insight.
---
Lorax &gt; Showdown
---
Trees &gt; bushes
---
Fix teaming, brawl ball, robo rumble, the boss fight mode the list goes on for a while..
---
Its called SOLO showdown for a reason. If you want a team play duo showdown
---
There's already too much "round puddle" modifiers, we need something new, I don't know, maybe like  heil, smaller and faster than meteorites, but nothing like the shrooms and meteorites pls
---
Always felt Shelly and Colt would complete each other
---
Wow, 90% of the field can't be played 
---
Same thing happened to me until recently where I got Leon, so just keep playing you might get something great
---
I'm not saying worse, maybe just as bad? You're point, if i understand correctly, is that ultra aggressive play is bad, and i agree, i just have the opposite problem nearly as much, players who refuse to push or exhert map control.
---
Obviously
---
Hey man thanks for the reply, i am currently at 1300 trophies and is it worth buying token doublers 1000 for 50 gems?
---
I think they would get in hot water by changing it and not rewarding people who had already unlocked those staging with something.
---
Played 4 day's and I got it
---
Good one 
---
Preferably, matchmaking would be based on total trophies and brawler rank. However, I can see how that might not be possible as the playerbase isn't that big yet (especially in higher ranks). I honestly hope that Supercell can find a solution; with this I'm trying to inform them that it is severely impacting my experience.
---
Hmm..Pulling his contact lenses downü§®

Tanks are countered by throwers until he gets up close to them, and then throwing shots on them is hard and/or he outpaces them and kills them. I don't use autoaim most the time (unless I need to like with bull or something) 
---
Supercell haven't talked about this wtf
---
Dead meme.
---
Never expected it lol
---
The four of them would have no problem taking him down. The poison limited his movement, so he had no opportunity to make a worth while attack.
---
it's a tribute because now is dead. 
---
I cry
---
Weird flex but ok
---
I totally like the idea since im coming from pokemon and we have different moves and up to 4 different abilitys. So its like amlost everyone plays different teams and strategic. Except on tournaments different story.this would allow us to optimize the brawlers to our playstyle alot more
---
Fournuts
---
They already changed once. When they realeased this system there was some other reward at 4k trophies. Later they changed that reward to Mega Box so many players were mad but with time many people forgot that even happend.
---
I need to click the link.

Nice gif! Just to point out, I'm pretty sure the red thingy is supposed to be his lollipop, not the costume tongue.
---
top ten pictures taken before disaster
---
Huh? They DO make it more rewarding to play all brawlers, because your total trophy count (which yields rewards both from trophy road AND end of season rewards) is a cumulative number from all of your brawlers. What else do you want??
---
My friends underestimate Shelly
---
Spike is working on the heavy update

Nice :)
---
I got Tara when i was at 6.000 trophies, now i'm with 8.200 and still no legendary...
---
But my mini account with less than 1k got Crow already, lol 
---
I believe it takes around 2 years if you are dedicated and collect all of your tokens.
---
Exactly, just see better! Duh...
---
I‚Äôve got 2 more for y‚Äôall, one with Mortis, Crow, Spike, and Colt, and the other with Pam, Piper, Bow, Darryl, Penny, and Tara. Ill be uploading the other two over the course of the next two days
---
You're right. My opinion might've been a bit too strong. The problem is, that players are maining one brawler and getting matched with me while they're really bad. I want them to start playing all brawlers, but I understand that it's not as easy as giving rewards.
---
Yeah again I couldn‚Äôt really think of anything for rico
---
It has happened to me too
---
What about when you unlock a new brawler and they‚Äôre at level 1? If you‚Äôre 6k total and only get matched against other 6k players, you‚Äôll be putting your level 1 brawler against brawlers that are level 7+, often even maxed out. That means unlocking new brawlers isn‚Äôt even exciting because they‚Äôd be nearly unusable for weeks until you level them up due to the huge disadvantage. Unlocking new brawlers should be immediately exciting and you should be able to play them against fairly levelled opponents right away. 
---
Only at 2700 plus LOL
---
RichoSHIT
---
U get the point,tho if u use auto aim and a tank is near u(for example bull but he is not on top of u) u will be missing all ur shots,watch Kairos time's vid as he interviews a top dynamike player, https://youtu.be/vcjdwd2Aa_4
---
Prrbail u almost have super aka u almost have killed them
---
Relly? Because why???? I nerf this shit 3 times

Good one! Lol

I don't think she looks like Yugi entirely, maybe the hair... But if you think, we have very different views... Btw, thanks for feedback :D

What was this map called again? Windy Plains?
---
Well.. x2 explosion radius. Deals 1000 damage. And spawns next to players... this is just insane.
---
Can somebody explain to me how some of you were able to play the game before release?
---
Stormy Plains, the land of throwers
---
one of my favs, i love him so much
---
Hi, I‚Äôm a 8.5k player and most of my brawlers are power level 7( upgradable), 3 are maxed with star powers. I‚Äôve never spent real money on the game and I‚Äôve been playing since June 2018. I believe I have enough power points to max all my brawlers to at least level 8. 
---
He's really powerful. Got a lucky one, bud
---
When i was at 2k trophies, I thought it was something for fun too. Now i'm with 8k trophies and i know how can that change the whole match...
---
Okay yeah. I knew I had seen it before.
---
It's better than hot maze
---
This needs more upvotes
---
Does that exist? Because the only Legendary I dont have is Leon
---
Don‚Äôt mess wit Jess!

Yah, now i am nostalgic and i want it back, at least there is easy to counter trowers with mortis, on hot garbage is not....

Still... 1000 damage and hp + move speed of melee robot. I think it's too much. Think about when the robots are going to be tougher. He will gain speed + damage. This will make it impossible

---
Fixed
---
:) 
---
Prepare to be stoled
---
I hate it so much
---
Thats how pay walls become a thing..
---
But i feel by the 10000 trophy stage you would alrdy have all the gold u would need anyway so not quite sure what you would put in its place
---
Recently I played vs Tara 10 lvl with super in gem grab. All six players had 111-112 trophy and 1-5 lvl except Tara. Opposite team humiliated us near spawn point. My teammates gave up  fight. Just it was interesting to saw Tara super first time. 
---
Worst match ever! 
---
i have darryl...
---
I love fanarts with Leon &lt;3
---
I think Mortis will get a rework, more damage with a fast reload speed but a move speed decrease (maybe, look at Mortis, he's slower than Nita.)
---
Primo
---
Kills you then auto aims the air twice then auto aims his super on a teammate across the map
---
Also laugh when she gets to Franck and start shooting her super but she gets it back instantly after that ;)
---
Chicken
---
Where is this from?
---
This would be so cool :)
---
Can you even get legendary shop offers before unlocking both mythics?
---
Also also Leon: just delete brawl stars he's a virus
---
You are right. These are the most beneficial use of gems in the shop right now. However, the token double is not 60 but 50 gems (might change depending on the country maybe?).
---
The token double will bring you 10 brawl boxes over time, while the mega box is already 10 brawl boxes in one box.
---
Don‚Äôt mess with the bowl!
---
RO-BO
---
I think the 1000 token doubler is the best buy, with 10 extra box you can obtain extra ticket/gems/brawlers. I'll take it! Do you know if it's a one time only offer?
---
Sounds like a personal problem.
---
Alright, why would it deserve it more?
---
This makes no sense at all. The Fortnite devs communicate directly with the community daily, they push out weekly updates,  there‚Äôs no hint of a pay-to-win system, and the game is ridiculously polished.
---
Brawl Stars is fun, but you can‚Äôt say it‚Äôs more deserving in any way compared to Fortnite. 
---
I've seen people in this sub have similar problems 
---
I had that same issue, however my phone died. Your boxes were opened, you have your rewards. Most likely only PowerPoints and coins if you do not see a new brawler. 
---
I sincerely doubt anybody was copying brawl stats buddy. 
---
I‚Äôm not sure. I already had both margins before legendary offers were introduced. What I am saying is that pulling a legendary from a box is a lot harder then pulling a mythic and he already has a good amount of gems in that it would be better for overall progression if he simply waited to pull Tara from a box and just bought a legendary
---
High character is that?
---
All good, im just kidding. Its the different hair colors that remind me of yugi
---
It is a glitch, supercell said they are fixing it on twitter
---
Incest Brawl!!!! Lmao I kid
---
He's obviously scratching himself 
---
The 1000 token doubler is a standard offer, so in theory this will be on the store forever.
---
lol
---
Okay, well stop trying to get Karma and get off of this subreddit if you think the game is so messed up. Heck, or maybe find out some ways to fix the problems maybe. Complaining isn't going to do anything.
---
yep, was just searching on this as it's been driving me nuts. I have to play on data for the game to be remotely playable, not even sure how that makes any sense since my wifi can get 160 Mb down
---
Supercell in Tokyo giveaway
---
This is so cool and well done
---
Cool :)
---
Omg I'm a pokemon fan as well
---
Coolio
---
If someone likes this idea and wants to make an actual version, please go for it. My Snapchat version is nothing compared to some of those skins posted on here
---
Complaining about the problems this game has is  bad, I love this game even climbed to the top 200. In my country but this game has a lot of issues that need to be addressed
---
Didn‚Äôt see the update for boom Brock..... must be blnd
---
And each pokemon either have at most 2 or 3 abilities, including the hidden abilities
---
Nakkatooyah
---
That‚Äôs just luck.  It‚Äôs very unlikely.
---
Jessie's hell. Her bullet only bounces thrice, no? There'll be that one box that's untouched xD that's gonna hurt 
---
Shelly's and bull's 'camp near traps' eyes turned red
---
nearly $20 for one character, cmon $¬¢ what kind of crap is that üòÇ
---
Oh. I see. My kind has traumatized you
---
Oh right completely forgot about the 3 targets part. Mah bad
---
What‚Äôs up with people teaming up during solo? There should be a way to prevent this. 
---
Imagine playing showdown and losing to teamers lol
---
269 gems is almost 54 brawl box (using token doubler conversion).  
---
Just for info.  
---
This. Sometime there just isn't enough people at your level on your server at any given time. This is a fucking mobile game, I don't have all day waiting for a game start. Just let me get a game in when I can.
---
Reminds me a little of my map xD
---
Good job lmao!! would love to play dis map
---
Peek them 3 shots, then Super
---
This is the exact problem though: teaming won't stop teaming because they're afraid someone else will team. It's like being the first guy to put your gun down to start a ceasefire. Nobody wants to be the one to take the risk, but it's shittier for everyone if nobody does. I think Supercell need to step in and do something to stop teaming, because it's ruined the mode for many players.

Whenever I contact them I get not response.

Thanks.

OK guys, I bought this skin finally. Case closed lol.

why does he look so much like a monkey omegalul

Those spawns are a little bit too close to each other...

That‚Äôs brilliant

Esa no me la esperaba.png xd
---
OH BOY!! MOCKEY APROVES IT !
---
If the situation is that someone is teaming in a solo match, then killing the teamers is always appropriate :-) They're the ones wasting everyone else's time
---
&gt;It really sucks when people just want to kill u 
---
Funny choice of words for a free-for-all showdown
---
but still we are not guranteed to get a mythic
---
Depends. Have you spent the gems? If you have it‚Äôll give you a negative chargeback. But why would you want to chargeback? That‚Äôs not how you refund purchases. Don‚Äôt think buying then charging back will work. Contact Apple if you want a refund.

I like that leon "no point in trying." Wonder where you saw that? üòÅ
---
u didnt quote everything... theres nothing wrong with wanting to kill me but its just illogical to just die just so u can kill me with you
---
UpVoted :D
---
No. From someone who's done it up to around 300$. Thought they would remove gems but nope.
---
Love it !!
---
No. Please stop.
---
How long ago did you do this?
---
So I won‚Äôt be banned?

wow dank boi

Weird flex but okay

Lmfao I get the joke now go whoosh me if you want

Hello my friend. Happy new year and merry Christmas 
---
Are you kidding? It was getting upvotes and it‚Äôs funny 
---
Sky's Dreams
---
You‚Äôll need another 1250 coins to upgrade her once you hit that level cap. Tough decision but her star power is badass; might be worth it. 
---
Sry if this a stupid question I just started the game. I know increasing the power helps but does increasing rank do anything?
---
Forgot the shelly and El primo teaming 
---
You know I'm on my knees right I'm 13 and 5,6
---
Coach Corey just released a video on his YouTube channel addressing that very question.  You should watch it.
---
I‚Äôll check it out but to deflect 100% of the damage and bounce it back to them might be to OP. Maybe a 15-20% chance to deflect some bullets to the attacker also like 50% to block all or some bullets cause 100% will be too OP 
---
`well balanced like everything should be`
---
Give me a legendary brawler
---
Same. Just consider yourself lucky and move on haha
---
it can happen if you spam the battle and exit button
---
It won't go higher or lower
---
I wish. I‚Äôve seen to many waiting in a random bush in a corner of the map. Like dude you already play the most op champ in showdown why do you play like a bitch ? 
---
Clearly, you don‚Äôt know da wae üòî. 
---
Is this really a huge deal though?  Personally I don‚Äôt think it is at all, plenty of games that sell skins have done exactly this in the past. Same with hundreds of other companies with food or similar types of ‚Äúlimited‚Äù products. 
---
It doesn‚Äôt , it just helps in matchmaking
---
......
---
give me 20$ and I'll give you a legendary brawler
---
41 is no where near a world record for bounty. 
---
No, they don't need any nerf
---
Do you have to actually upgrade her for the star power to appear or just have the power points maxed? Cuz you don't have enough coins to upgrade her all the way yet, I don't believe
---
All shots piercings would be pretty broken IMO, it‚Äôs like every shot is his super except with shorter range. Combine it with that guaranteed 2nd bounce and I would think he would be pretty OP.
---
I‚Äôve got Leon. No mithics...
---
Word. This always happens. 
---
Removed - Your post is too short, please expand on your title.
---
I would tbh. New brawler is essentially free 300 trophies and it would take A LOT longer to get her otherwise, and whatever brawler you get unlocks new potentials for new team combos and whatnot
---
Oops sorry
---
And nita
---
Her main fire reminds me of that one weapon in gungeon (idk the exact name) which is a shotgun that shoots 3 shotguns. Her fire is really good for stupid enemies that line themselves up one after another, but the higher you get the rarer this will be.
---
Leon's the best man
---
oops sorry!üòî
---
Okay but why is Leon a different color?
---
I want perchatki and hat
---
Less HP too
---
I went to ReaperinRed's profile and scrolled all down to this :)
---
# Hmmmmmmmmmmmm
---
Different walking speeds too, its a very little difference but gives quite a big advantage at some points.

Damn colt died or something
---
Every fan made map: ‚Äú_____ Valley‚Äù

You don't need to look at it. You could ignore it. Lots of people share their accomplishments here. Maybe you could be happy instead of a sour puss.
---
Hah
---
I love when people want other random people to get the solutions that a big ass company cant get to adress a problem in Reddit. If you dont give a posible solution, bad, if you try it and give some examples you are acting like you know how to program better matchmaking, worst. 
---
We dont care about what solution they chose, but they must fix asap.
---
You know a simple way to fix it? Stop uaing aimple values as total trophies or brawler trophies. A good MM system has several values to create an elaborate system
---
:00000000000
---
He prob played the other brawlers and kept losing and he only won with nita
---
I just faced somebody with Shelly at 343 trophies. Guess how many total trophies? Yes, 343 
---
# *extreme HMMMMMMMMMMMMMM*
---
Ty ,üôÇ
---
This game hate us bro lol
---
Dont even get why people main a brawler
---
but it was tap to aim so it was ok
---
Can you elaborate this point
---
Looks like bone pit xD
---
Yeah, it doesn't make sense
---
But apparently people in this sub think it isn't a problem
---
She only screams. Feels like she's 3 year old
---
Oops
---
I had the same idea that's pretty cool
---
Subtitle: ‚ÄúThe greatest tap-aimers of the century‚Äù

birb 
---
telepathy I guess 
---
Ah yes, the good 'ol Colly ship
---
?????????
---
Good job to the penny getting 7 trophy's with one booster lol
---
cuz their play style was horrible, camped bushes whole time acting like the enemy didn‚Äôt know where they were, sat and watched while i was 1v3 and getting hammered 
---
As a Rico main, I am offended deeply :-(
---
Excatly
---
Really cause when my brother had purchased a pack with a super rare and epic  before that he opened a brawl box and got the last super rare he needed it then changed and it brought the super rare and epic to be an epic epic purchase
---
Configuration - supercell ID - create An account
---
I love Poco! And this is so true. Been playing a lot of him in the current showdown map. Almost impossible to hide from him and he basically turns into a shotgunner with no damage fall off once he gets a few cubes
---
Gonna be sick
---
Damn, both things I thought I'd noticed but weren't listed as stats and are pretty important so I figured they would be if they were at all different!
---
I don't understand the first 2 statements, and Spike is unrelated to everyone else, he is it's own species.
---
if you didn‚Äôt create a supercell ID and link it to your account on your old phone then your account it gone
---
Can confirm 
---
Also, your character moves its head to look in the direction of a close-by enemy. Even if they're in a bush. So if you're running and suddenly your brawler turns head, someone's approaching from the bush.
---
They both build stuff :B
---
i can understand you. hope SC could see it.
---
This is sweet
---
No way dude
---
If you are on mobile go to the subreddit, press on top right and "change user flair", if you are on pc the change user flair is on the sidebar(right side of your screen).
---
Your point is really stupid. I can get what he saying really fast, maybe open your mind a little bit!
---
Rip Poco :( He‚Äôs just like me IRL too!
---
Also
---
*been looking 
---
Lost both games, these don‚Äôt count by wins
---
Maybe drive and park is a better game? Lol
---
Not to be rude, can we stop with these? These are only speculation besides a couple which we know of.
---
My friend didn‚Äôt spend any money on the game and couldn‚Äôt unlock anyone bedsides Shelly Nita and colt and only really liked the play style of Nita since the beginning
---
I'd really want to see that
---
And they retreat after getting hit once
---
No I mean like I thought it was a standoff and whoever moved first would be dead
---
But no 50% booster :/
---
Yes, I love this! most maps have a choke point, but two will really shake things up a bit
---
What was at 4K at that time 
---
We league of legends now bois
---
There is no likes. Just that they are not against it. So it will always happens.
---
With that grammar and spelling will we be able to understand the stories?
---
Been like this for ages no one knows why
---
This. Even if you have two offers and only one left to unlock, the other will show expired once you purchase it
---
In game it would mess people up, for example having the choice between picking up the tenth gem for your team or getting this gem, people would throw the game for this gem. 
---
I like Colt for breaking down the fence and long range seige. His super can create a clear window. Bull and El Primo are good for storming the safe, but have trouble closing in on ranged brawlers.
---
Bro. Chill out. There's always going to be bad players in any game. If you get mad at them just move on. You don't have to rant about people who are probably just having fun.
---
I had two in my shop, bought one, and the other one just changed to expired and wasn't purchasable anymore. Special offers might be different, but I'm speaking simply to the purchase of a brawler by itself
---
I wish more people picked up on those signals. I‚Äôm a 2P leon. You are a 0P dynomike. You and i both know there is a 15P bull in the bush in the center. Why the hell do you kill me only to get shotgunned? I‚Äôm not killing you for a reason. 
---
brawl stars is an amazing game and I think everyone who is part of this subreddit is glad it made the global release. I think the main point where the most people are going to criticise brawl stars is with the updates. There were not many updates during beta whereas I think this is going to change in global :D
---
Those people are making their teamates lose its bad
---
I can‚Äôt take a single brawler to 500... my god.. 
---
These are just tables, they can be opened in Excel. can be edited in a regular notepad
---
Was that today, cause in my shop theres one then a special one for some gems off
---
*insert happiness here*
---
I think El Primo, easily.
---
Checks username
---
I wish it was a permanent mode :/
---
No, it‚Äôs Bull.
---
Laser? ü§î
---
Reddit is worldwide. Not everyone is fluent in English.
---
No this was a week or two ago
---
The best brawlers in this mode are : Barley,Dynamike,Broke and bull, my favorite map is  Safe zone. I like this mode but I think it's too easy to win just because you are aggressive
---
r/BrawlStars
---
Can I show u a screenshot somehow?
---
SO COOL!!
---
I will
---
This is such an art.. pls do more drawings
---
But he already has PTSD...
---
This is what I do 
---
Maybe more likely coins cuz gems to OP
---
Thanks
---
Yeah but I already have plenty of good brawlers. Is it really worth it?
---
No fair! Still waiting for my second :-(
---
4 penises
---
Maybe hes alone. But hes still happy and he doesent care about ur jokes
---
Reflex is gone
---
This way supercell could add more unique brawlers 
---
"You better bull-ieve it!"
---
You get 8.5 coins per gem for the expensive deal. You get 8 coins per gem for the middle deal. And 7.5 coins per gem for the first deal
---
power level 10 frank with 23 trophiesüòê
---
Idk, do you have any epics? Three packs of token doublers is essentially 3 mega boxes, it depends on how badly you want a new brawler
---
NO
---
Don't waste gems in buying brawlers
---
Nsfw and spoilers?
---
Thanks! Canvas sheet
---
is it dinomyke?
---
yes 
---
cuuute 
---
Us Bulls must stick together in this harsh world.
---
Yikes, no need to downvote my dude, sometimes you just really need a new brawler, the odds of getting a brawler in that many gems worth of boxes is pretty low
---
more like made in heaven
---
Don't buy brawlers, don't buy boxes
---
If you get constantly 32 in Robo Rumble, buy tickets, the biggest deal of tickets
---
If not, buy token doubler.
---
Also, sometimes you will get an offer of a megabox for 49 gems, buy it instead of token doubler
---
I don‚Äôt have any epics.
---
I think it would help AVOID needing to invent new ones.  There are certainly some other types of attacks that can be weaved into the game but there are already plenty of Brawlers to work on leveling and there are quite a few that are very niche, where an alternate Super would be amazing.  Imagine Nita with something other than a Bear, like a Rage mode or something?  I like your Piper and Bo ideas as well to give them better DPS over their current utility Supers.  Lots of options out there.
---
Not sure if u troll but you buy the coins for gems not the other way round.
---
So you get a better value the more u buy
---
Damnit. Sorry about that. 
---
Guess I thought you spend coins to get gems. Saw that wrong. My mistake. 
---
Guess there is no way to get gems without spending IRL money. 
---
That sucks. 
---
In the end it‚Äôs up to you whether or not the brawler is worth more than the coins and power points
---
Theres still like a 200 trophy difference between the teams
---
Dude nice!!!! My Leon is a power 6. Trying to crack top 200 US (~553). Got up to 493 until I started playing cavern churn. Down to 470. Such a hard map for Leon. It‚Äôs so annoying being in the upper 400s as everyone has power 10 üò≠
---
nice but not nicer than you..
---
Amazing.. the only thing i would add is tiny stars at tht green thing for above 600+ trophies
---
This guy should work at Supercell ü§£
---
I know who stole Mortis' hat - YoMomma
---
On my next concept I could work on the Nita 
---
Box box
---
Get them from brawl boxes
---
HOW DARE YOU DISRESPECT THE MIGHTY CROW
---
literally happend to me 10 min ago
---
I have both, crow fun factor is insane tho
---
I agree that if I am playing a 450 brawler, i would rather get matched with a 450 brawler that ALSO has the same overall trophies. But I think this will place more restriction on matchmaking, and I think it's unnecessary because the 450 brawler with different overall trophies is probably still good at the specific 450 brawler he has, that's how he got to 450 in the first place. There is a chance I could be with a noob who paid someone for all his games before the exact game I got with him, but I think this is so low of a chance... If you have seen MULTIPLE complete noobs at high trophies with individual brawlers, then that is kind of weird, and I would agree that someone with high overall trophies is less likely to be a noob.
---
*shrug*
---
Wow i want em 
---
Cool man
---
i love it
---
Nice!!! I want crow. :/ 
---
I pulled Leon out of a normal 100 token brawl though so I can‚Äôt complain lol
---
Maybe 10 coins for every win ? Or 1 coin for every bar collected ?
---
Thanks :)
---
That‚Äôs actually pretty good! I don‚Äôt think about that. Even though In the commercial he chucks a cactus  at him lol
---
*Tara supers out of nowhere *
---
Wow. You drew this urself havent u? Right? GUYS?
---
Please use our Discord server: discord.gg/brawlstars
---
Username checks out
---
it will probably rotate like fortnite
---
Yeah. It's not that horrible but it's just stupid when it's as bad as it is
---
But pam is better than frank...
---
Yeah that's the other side of the coin. 
---
Not if u are a crow main. Ur just f*cked cauz everyone teams with Leon.
---
Next will be cant touch taste and smell
---
ooh yes i want it
---
duos IS showdown so you will be fine(it would probably be the best to play aswell because of the respawning)
---
Darryl also deserves voice lines. 
---
Ehh, there‚Äôs a reason he‚Äôs called a toxic ‚ÄúAssassin‚Äù. If he was support, he would be called toxic ‚ÄúSupporter‚Äù. His walk speed is also set to assassin speed which is 820
---
im still working on that ;) 
---
This is what I call art
---
Also new Meme template Lol üëåüëåüëå
---
Ah that bums me out. I wished for some exclusive skins but it's not going to be it by the looks of it. I like the shelly but please give us more 100% exclusive skin opportunities! 
---
hahahahah
---
Aye, thank you dood c:
---
I‚Äôll buy it when Leon is in the shop
---
That‚Äôs a mistake.. you think you‚Äôre overpowered because you are on 0 trophies, reach for 100/200 and up and watch yourself dying like crazy (at least at low power, if you upgrade him, he‚Äôs good)
---
I have level 1 mortis and I am at 203 trophies 
---
I will still team but I will backstabbing them. 
---
Lol, like Brawl stars is the only app I use on my phone. The game should give me the option and not force me to buy this or that to make the game playable.
---
‚ÄúJust unlocked‚Äù... ok then üòÑ
---
Literally I‚Äôve been pointing this out this whole time and everybody downvoted my posts and gets mad at me for ‚Äúdiscouraging players‚Äù
---
Ok, thanks, but i allways rush with him, like noobie.  :/
---
Maybe you‚Äôre the problem because you‚Äôre the common denominator in all ten games. The randoms from your first game probably didn‚Äôt lose 10 games in a row lmao. Same with the second set of randoms and so on. 
---
Yeah I spammed him all night he is a lot of fun.
---
So? Everyone can battle eachother even if they are kinda related.What if brawl stars is actually a kind of Hunger Games?
---
Totally agree!
---
*Invites* - that would be possible for the president and vice presidents!
---
**Band Mail** - for the club president!
---
**Club Wars** or just something that we could do as a team (club) all together, for ex a big box for a certain numbers of wins or kulls, etc.
---
This would be an awesome addition to the game and it would make being in a club more reasonable!
---
As and avid HotS player, the reason two ultimates work so easily is because you choose them midway through the game, they largely depend on the map or situation and you can literally check what ultimates your teammates and enemies have by pressing tab. There's no good way to do this in Brawl Stars, unless you have a small icon at the beginning of a game. But that will likely be brief and, likely non-existent in a showdown game. And you don't want to miss out on knowing whether or not Shelly can one-shot you.
---
But how do you manage to kill someone? Do you use him as an assassin? I have him at power two 350 trophies but I can‚Äôt deal a shit of damage... 
---
100% real :'(
---
Thanks, that helps!

Maybe not necessary, but would be helpful
---
I think it‚Äôs totally ridiculous that people‚Äôs posts can be deleted by a moderator that decides whether it‚Äôs low effort or not. How the heck would they know. Let‚Äôs say somebody photoshopped an image for a few hours and posted it. It then got deleted because that could‚Äôve been done by an amateur photoshoper in 15min. It‚Äôs completely ridiculous.
---
Yeah youre right
---
I think it would be a great idea!
---
Yes I rush too, I just can‚Äôt resist but some brawlers are just good as assassins.. and I think Mortis is one of them (even tho you can melt low health brawlers like colt if I‚Äôm not mistaken)
---
You can see someone has their super by the circle around them.. and it turns yellow when actively aiming with super 
---
Hello there! I understand you are having questions about in-game progression.
---
You should have a total of 6 common/League reward brawlers and 1 rare brawler. The first draw is predetermined. Brawl boxes and completely based off of luck and if you would like to go in specific with these chances, just let me know.
---
If you would like to contact the team. Please contact them using the ‚ÄúHelp and Support‚Äù option, than go to ‚ÄúContact us‚Äù.
---
Best regards, JonathanandK. ü§†
---
And yet so many people (most likely the majority) would completely disagree with you. 
---
Do the ticket events. They don‚Äôt always give you even number tokens
---
So is crow
---
#Spinifugay :p
---
I play heist however I feel like doing. Sometimes I choose Penny and place her mortar by the safe to defend, or sometimes I choose Nita or Jessie to put the bear/turret on the enemy safe. Usually I use Nita though. (I also use Barley sometimes.)
---
The only good news is that I appear in top 25 because there are just so few playing there. Would love to be in my actual country tho... Is there any way to change this?
---
If you want to change it you'll have to go to the staff or something.

Even darryl makes fun of him
---
Idunno man, ask my team mates
---
I used to think he was bad until I realized I that you need to be specific on which maps to play him on. 
---
for rico should been: Same as Colt but his bullets will come to you no matter what.
---
Yeah i know thats my point the guy i replied to said it goes up
---
I need ricochet, the legendaries, and the mythics. Got all 3 epics. 
---
Cuz he killed darryl :)
---
Spicymike
---
Long range wins unless Shelly jumps him close up
---
You can check by going to the shop and tapping either of the boxes and tapping the i in the top left corner there it says all of your drop percentages
---
leon is a joke
---
Crow is great when you have a team that can clean up and take care of all the poisoned players trying to hide. Otherwise his damage and health is to shitty to do anything with. 
---
Bull doesent even have to leave the bush 
---
You need to play very carefully dont rush high damage/hp brawlers like bull, primo etc try to flank and take down brawlers like colt, crow, penny, jessie etc and most important dont miss your super try get as close as possible that they cant out range you
---
Damage +8%
---
Range +1 tile 
---
Invisibility +1 second
---
And there u go here are my changes to make Leon seem more balanced
---
Same 
---
This is a joke right
---
oke dokey
---
Bruh there are like 20 Leons there.
---
Mortis might be level 9
---
***\*ALL CREDIT TO***  u/thepengu77 ***\****
---
Maybe he's level 9?
---
He‚Äôs a plant
---
Im missing ricochet penny all epics all mythics and all legendaries
---
...Hello? I'd like to get some bushes on my property removed, how much will it cost?
---
I'm at 4.2k trophies.... with only rares and super rares :/
---
Is this just for a particular game mode? I‚Äôm looking for a brawler for Deathcap Cave
---
I like how mods keep this up but delete my ‚Äúlow-effort‚Äù posts in 5 minutes
---
He is like Mortis, get close to low health brawlers, kill them and run away. Avoid tanks. You can also apply pressure and do chip damage, then escaping.
---
Darryl is so much better than Bull and Shelly at high trophies, don't play him as if he were a shotgunner
---
There's nothing glitched. The last person to deal damage to the Rico was the dyna
---
Wow!
---
You can do it on mobile
---
I SHAKE MY *SHAKE MY HAND*

did it in 24 sec homie
---
False advertising 
---
Jojo*
---
Crow flair explains it all
---
If you need to select a star power, why is the box pointing to ‚ÄòSUPER‚Äô
---
He is level 10, you can tell by the star underneath him, like, in the green circle, you can see a star shape inside it. By that you can tell of a brawler is lvl 10
---
Everything looks fine to me...?
---
Looks like 7 to me crackhead
---
Well ppl have done it in like 13 sec lmao
---

Where does it say that pink one is female?
---
NEVER
---
Seems like a wonderful idea, but it won't happen since they would need a whole new team for the story 
---
Nope, you can see in the video that he's level 10
---
I don't get this at all why the f*** is there a dynamike head on a dinosaur
---
Seems fine
---
They are both male...
---
Glad you liked my Rage idea!
---
Can I ask a quick question? Didnt wanna make a new post just for it. Are tokens always rewarded in even numbers? Like 10, 20, 30 and so on?
---
I can‚Äôt believe this comment. You think a template meme is high effort? I think it‚Äôs absolutely ridiculous that one would think a TEMPLATE MEME is not low effort. If someone takes hours to make a meme off a template, that is 100000% on them. And it‚Äôs not just a moderator, I and many other people on this subreddit decide what is low effort through the report button.
---
Crow was one of the best brawlers in the game before, the only nerf was the amont of hits required to charge his super was increased. So why do you want a health buff if he was one of the best brawler with the same health?? If you want to buff him decrease the time he takes to charge his super. 
---
Skin to win bro
---
Leon isn‚Äôt been op...
---
The red bars in the meter are overlapping the black line, and that is not the case with the blue bars in the blue line for your team.
---
First being El Primo right?
---
El Peter couldn't make it today. I'm his counterpart El El Peter.
---
The joke is that it is the same background as the one used in the "you know I had to do it to 'em" meme. It was purposely made like that to make the meme less important (as El Peter explained).
---
I hope this answers your question.
---
El El Peter out!
---
dId YoU jUsT aSsUmE sPiKe‚ÄôS gEnDeR(s)???
---
I‚Äôll ~~carry~~ help you. How many total trophies u got
---
Bo definitely needs a buff because enemies can walk into a mine and quickly walk back so they don‚Äôt get hurt. A possible solution to this could be a trap instead of a mine that goes off instantly, but does less damage.
