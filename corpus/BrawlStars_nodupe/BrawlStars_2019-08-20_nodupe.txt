I have 661 trophies lvl 6 mortis bruh

Wow!! great job!

Honestly I hope you are lying, there are people who haven't spent any star points for skins and now have 20k+ star points, resulting to 20+ mega boxes, which is 200+ brawl boxes for nothing, so if you don't know anything about how the game works, don't even bother talking.

It that instance, when the Gene super hits your teammate , it will heal them. The super will continue and hit the enemy and pull them through your teammate toward you.

You get 2 star points because as I saw in your profile you dont even have 7000 trophies. It's endgame content and noobs complaining about it shouldn't have any access to it so instead of complaining about it get yourself some trophies

I love it! Maybe add a few more barrels in their section? It would add more coverage to the safe, and less open area. Overall, would love to see this in-game. Keep up the good work!

Bounce remaining means you have the chance to get a new brawler (legendary maybe) star power or a 200 token doubler

Even tho this subreddit is great and have an awesome community, it could be better! One idea that I suggest to implement is to do weekly community tournaments. For example, do a tourney once a week and the winner could win ‚Äúaward‚Äù or gift cards or just do normal tournaments that are just for fun. This would have a positive effect as for the subreddit and for the community within as people will make new in game friends, keep the community active and interactive and most importantly fun! Also don‚Äôt forget interesting!

If this post doesn‚Äôt receive at least 3k upvotes it is a crime. I couldn‚Äôt agree more.
---
Removed - DO NOT SUBMIT POSTS WITH TITLES IN ALL CAPS. CAPS LOCK IS CRUISE CONTROL FOR COOL
---
Overused, I guess, but that's irrelevant. And bad is subjective. Quit whining. It's not as simple as that either. Negative karma farm comes from a bunch  of morons who catch notice of a post that offends them because "WaAh ThIs Is UnFuNnY" and they downvote it into the ground. It's petty.
---
Just RNG
---
That sub should just get deleted. On second thought, it's a good source for ironically funny content so scratch that.
---
I doubt they wouldn‚Äôt have the idea of some kind of balance prior to designing the new star powers as these are newly implemented functions to the game, which are much easier to balance versus increment of changes to their stats. And I‚Äôm not saying they need to have a full detailed planned, but notable star powers that may need a balance/rework upon coming back from vacation; this allows them to get a jump on these balances and maybe even dish them out a week or 2 after they come back, so about now?
---
If I remember correctly, star point system is apart of the summer update? It consists of the new star point system and the new star powers. Sure, you may argue that this should be enough content; however, let‚Äôs not forget about the huge paywall and time that blocks this form of ‚Äúcontent.‚Äù Could you really say it‚Äôs sufficient in terms of content for the general player base? Many won‚Äôt even come close to buying some of the star point skins and even then, it‚Äôs really just a cosmetic. There was a reason why they decided to release star power and bunches; this was the sole reason of stretching content because they know themselves that it will not last and be sufficient as ‚Äúcontent.‚Äù
---
Yup, they want to do everything at once: balances, new content, etc. There‚Äôs where the problem lies, this not only pushes the release date of the update, but gives them an excuse. This allows them to have the sense of security knowing that they don‚Äôt have to appease the demand of the people, but really go at the pace that‚Äôs most profitable as a company.
---
It‚Äôs definitely not a bad idea for a company who‚Äôs looking to make a profit when comes towards the content they produce, but it‚Äôs really just how they go about handling distribution. They will milk content for the sake of milking content, so just keep that in mind. Isn‚Äôt it pretty coincidental that they proposed balances for these newly added star powers? Like maybe having many purchase them while they‚Äôre good, until balancing them to the point where they might not even consider buying it?
---
I believe you‚Äôre giving them too much credit. Their updates were near disastrous at one point during the beta stage where they didn‚Äôt listen to the community and instead went with their ‚Äúdeveloper intuition‚Äù, which was really just the money talking...

I made this map partially for aesthetic, but also cuz I actually would like this map to be in the game. I made the map non symmetrical for the most part besides the middle and along the very edges and sides of the map. I added bushes, walls, and open areas for sharpshooters, tanks, and throwers. I hope that it is balanced and does not encourage teaming. If you have any suggestions on how to improve this map, please comment them :3

There are a few random walls in the map and I‚Äôve removed them :p

Here before this gets to hot

Finally a worth opponent. Our battle will be legendary
---
He was the fastest low level brawler I got to 500, and the lowest level, at level 4. Had a good time playing him, but I think I'll leave him there untill he's maxed. 
---
Siege is great for him cause you can easily predict where enemies will go(bolts), and don't try to aim at the safe/IKE when there's people closer to you, if you want to do damage to it you gotta autoaim. If there's people, just try to zone them and let your teammates do damage.

Can you do Spike next? This is so cool!

Just remove the join my club one and it's all good

Thanks

Honestly though, I gotta day XD
---
Nice bro
---
It's true, but the problem is still there. I don't think they'll ever fix it cause it will require a big change in the game, and people don't want that. The problem is and has always been showdown (and teaming) that allows people to climb so easily. The only solution for us rn is to grind to around 600+ where that problem is almost nullified.

????????????????????????????

Okay, I heard something about that some weeks ago, but I still having two questions.

First, how do you use the super?

And second, you can auto aim with?

*i cant be the only guy who actually likes stars skins*

Then came a Penny or Jessie from the enemy team

Yep.
---
cacti main agree

Ikr same
---
How nice of Carl to show up after the party.
---
Meet band aid
---
And don't get me wrong it is definitely a bug
---
I don't really play Showdown, but yeah, teaming is the most idiotic thing in this game. I'm sure most of the clueless teammates in 3v3's are people who farm trophies by teaming. And it's not even fun to play like that, it's ONLY to take advantage from others.  
---
I was going to say, but didn't, in every game there's OP stuff, like Band-aid and snappy sniping, and it's a part of it for a while untill the devs balance it. But there's always gonna be something people complain, because it's in our nature. Just sit tight, take a break from the game, cause in around a week there's probably going to be new content + balance.
---
I would like if you press play again with randoms it automatically sets a new team game room for you. If there is someone already in your game room waiting to play they are removed and that game room is closed
---
This was amazing!! Keep up the good work !!! Freaking yeahhhh boiiii . This makes me chuckle quite a bit ...
---
I checked the other guy, both of my teammates weren‚Äôt in a clan
---
You should‚Äôve added one star point to the Mortis revolor skin
---
This is really annoying to have to deal with especially if you've run out of battle tokens.
---
El Primo wanted blood not shiny things
---
Legendary or mythic

You guys should add a video flair! It would help out people who are looking to improve their skills or just to see some fails

 Point #4 you are wrong. It is not matchmaking problem when 6 Shelly's are in Snake Prairie, it is cursed map problem. And this map is an example. Many maps are unbalanced. Here is a problem

Star powers don't affect you legendary luck. Its just probably bad.

He already knew it before my explanation
---
LMAO
---
Oh I know, I love playing Mortis but his reload speed is frustrating sometimes. He's a lot of fun but without any of his star powers, and even moreso in the current meta, he's IMO the hardest brawler to push. Too slow and too many counters everywhere.
---
This needs to be in hot plus more attention to this post :)

&lt;3

So? Repost is a repost. Like it or no
---
Lmaooo

Nah two crows are double toxic

He somehow managed to bring his brawlers to level 7, which cost coins also, find another excuse.

Exactly the point of this post. For the pro players this video is a tool to change their Frank super in order to have more chance of stunning.

He said "control brawler" not "overall brawler" which is true, Ticks control abilities are very powerful, hes just a very, very, very, very, very, very bad defender and inconsistent Brawler because of his random mines

Actually it's because shell shock isn't played that much because people think that bandaid is good anywhere, so they play it and lose.

Do you just realized that you insulted yourself because you have Gene Flair?
---
Fun fact: I once went to an Apple Store because my iPhone‚Äôs screen broke and, when I handled my unlocked phone to the guy in the shop, he looked at Cydia and then looked at me.
---
How it ended? He said: ‚ÄúMeh, I had Cydia too, no problem‚Äù
---
He was taunting
---
Tick needs only attack speed and his attaks should not be that random
---
The Darryl must have quit Braw Stars after that
---
Do note the ‚Äúif you know what you‚Äòre doing‚Äù in the title. When I used my super to get out of there, others might have stayed in that bush, given the same situation, and ended up fifth. Plus towards the end, I went through the poison into that little trapped area because I knew the third shelly was in the upper bush and would react to the two other shellies getting near her. The ‚Äúthird party‚Äù effect you are speaking of is a result of my actions, thus my reason to post this here.
---
If they removed the star power glitch....
---
*There are gonna be problems*
---
I think you need a Rune of Gold
---
yeah but he was taunting for long enough and primo was already mid jump, and bibi still didnt shoot
---
I'm acerrating with you but I think besides the attack speed also needs a little more damage and a little more movement speed

---
3) Based in the previous point, most people figure out how to check bushes. Bull and Shelly are super unviable in any map except Cavern Churn and Erratic Blocks when you hit higher trophies.

did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch?

I am trained in gorilla warfare and I‚Äôm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You‚Äôre fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that‚Äôs just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little ‚Äúclever‚Äù comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn‚Äôt, you didn‚Äôt, and now you‚Äôre paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You‚Äôre fucking dead, kiddo.

OMFG so true!!!! And it's not like u actually NEED a legendary, just a stupid rarity,no one complains about not having epics or mythics while u have legendaries don't u? Before I got Piper a week ago, I would've replace my Leon with her. Yeah seriously. Sadly I don't see lots of ppl that look at the power of the brawler, but only at this shitty rarity

Endgame content is what we should be looking for. Yes, Star Powers are endgame content but isnt it unfair how the metas between Casual and Competitive are so different? Star Powers make too much of a difference, thats why I want the main Brawlers to be strong, not Star Powers
---
What... just auto aim and all 3 will hit. Even if you can't auto aim because other brawlers are around  you can hit 2.  
---
He can also cut enemy brawlers off from the way you are attacking. Say you and a bull are attacking and the bull gets on the safe, no close range brawlers from the enemy team can threaten him because he is surrounded by mines. Or he can lay down mines behind you as your team move in towards the safe.
---
Gene: *Cries in the corner*

Honestly you should get a legendary if you get 9k upvotes or higher on this sub

Shelly's are very cocky. Just try to outplay them and you should be fine.

It happened to me three times so far, of course always when my team was winning. Only once we managed to keep the win. The game really has timing issues. 
---
For example, right now, there's another post up (circle of life) with a showdown where in the video, the last two are El Primo and Crow, and El Primo clearly dies a short moment before Crow. Yet the game then shows him as having killed the other, making him the winner.

Stuff like that is infuriating.

I can out play them it's just a bit ridiculous when more that 5 in a showdown and I'm playing mortis and I just get destroyed by her ultimate I thought she was op then they added bandaid to her to broken in my opinion

Yeah, beta players had all the opportunities. Two years of grinding? They could have earned all the gems needed to buy all the legendary brawlers outright. And because they are all maxed out on power points and coins they only needed gems for skins/brawlers so they should have plenty.

It's pretty ugly and Shelly is retarded brawler :e

It doesnt need to be only accessible to paid players for it to be p2w. Its basically a "free" advantage with no downsides for people who want to progress faster, imo the game should be balanced around the main stats of Brawlers, not Star Powers, thats why I called it p2w

---
No se metan con el rey leon :v
---
The only purpose for auto aim on high trophies I mean. I agree that that's a problem but there is not really a working solution for that. It either makes close combat somewhat unfair cause no one can predict players movement when they are point blank on you or it stays and newbies are way worse with non melee brawlers. For competetive play, autoaim is definitely good because everyone only uses it when it is better. It is just the casual play where autoaim is a problem. There is not really a solution see.
---

I think so too

Calm down, I just told him if he did not know. I still upvoted this because I liked this art anyways.

---
Go on the home Page of the subreddit, then click the three dots on the top-right part&gt;choose flair&gt;choose the brawler you want to have next to your name
---
Bruh am at 12k with 22 brawlers. I can't even move to others :(((((
---
This makes more sense than other leon concepts
---
Oh really?
---
It's
---
I have an idea: wyvern crow or dragon crow
---
I suppose it's the matchmaking
---
I think it would be ok to keep auto aim but make it so you have to double tap to use it instead, and if they really want to make close range fights "less awkward" they could even make shots come closer to the back of Brawlers or smth, so even if you get close to someone you still have a high chance of getting hit, but this is just an idea
---
The problem is that all of the Brawlers you get early on are too easy to play, and right now the only incentive to play others is to push trophies but other than that what reason is there? If someone is at 500 trying to push for star points or is even just trying to get the daily stars for the big chest they're most likely going to pick the easiest brawler hence the saturation of Shellys and other tanks they're just too easy to win with. Now if we had a legendary tank or something with the same easy ability to win everyone would be flipping shit calling op and unfair because not everyone had it, but that being said thats the point not everyone could have access to an easy win brawler and the game would still be playable because those would only be few encounters.
---
Hope it's not gonna bite me like a COBRA

I don't see why everyone keeps complaining about cavern churn, you can easily play on the outside. I got a ton of my rico trophies from cavern churn. At higher trophies it probably is a bigger problem but I don't you should play solo showdown at high trophies anyways.

I agree, and I think they can keep it as long as they:

1) give it a shorter cool down

Or 2) make it have health (as in you deal x damage to someone and their shield breaks)

That's a good idea but they can also make it disappear after you shoot for a more simple fix

Dark Blade is a Fighter brawler, who cuts in half everyone. He's a great swordsman, and with his two swords he can create a combo which increases its damage as the third shot is being used.
---
Main attack: Blades of doom
---
Shot type: Straight line which hits in a restricted area, like an El Primo but with a much thinner area of damage. 
---
First shot (One left sword hit)
---
Second shot (One right sword hit)
---
Third shot (Two hits with both swords)
---
With his last shot he uses both swords to deal a doubled damage.
---
Super: Sharp Rage
---
Dark Blade creates a random zig-zagged combo which has a duration that depends on how much ammo he has left. This can be used to escape dangerous situations or to attack simultaneously a large number of brawlers. During his super he doesn't take any damage.
---
