Hah

This has nothing on Fronk

That‚Äôs because those are strategies and can be countered. For example, you can bush check and you can some extent avoid getting 3rd partied. But teaming is just unfair

Mortis literally means dead.

Nope I got 22 rank 20s in the past 4 days

not at all. its like getting 300 pre update
---
Hajime no Ippo correct?
---
you can't check bushes when you need to heal and are running from an enemy
---
like how primo's head starts freaking out at :20 when he sees the piper
---
I agree
---
I don‚Äôt see your point here. Do you agree with teaming? Do you people to stop teaming? Do want Supecell to fix it? Give a bitch an answer, please.
---
Yes it haves,supercell can make that because he should made bigger servers and its dont easy.
---
I thinks its modded/well edited beacouse 
---
1. All the star powers are or comunity sugested (mortis,bibi and poco) or were what we were thinking the star power were(carl)
---
2. Think about pocos star power suggested,has no effect on 90% of the brawlers, barly has an affect on 9% brawlers(primo spike shelly...) and fucks crow
---
He does defent damage over a wide range with the ability to heal himself and other.
---
In order to keep replays, they have to save every single input for every single character in order to remake the match exactly. And the reason that it‚Äôs only for over 400 trophies is to keep the amount of data saved from a minimum otherwise they don‚Äôt have enough servers to save the data for the millions of matches there are. By cutting out all the matches under 400, it makes it much more manageable but still a lot of data
---
I sometimes forget that he is a heavyweight
---
AH REALLY
---
No. Actually, it‚Äôs epic and starting brawler
---
What about clash royale im pretty sure you can watch your replays from the very begining?
---
This list can be done in so many different ways for different maps
---
Maybe supercell can be a little more transparent rates and show actual rates for the rarities you need to unlock
---
[removed]
---
Well would you look at how poor this comment aged
---
Yep
---
Pocos star power 90% of brawlers=no effect
---
9%=barly a differece(bibi shelly...)

And crow gets apsolutly fucked

My level 7 penny is also now past 500 trophies! She is the best tbh.

Hey don't uninstall Brawl Stars on your phones you cant download it again

Yeah but everybody should have a fair chance of winning, only difference should be their skill. It takes skill to strategize (like bush camping) and it takes skill to counter those strategies (like bush checking). But teaming doesn‚Äôt take skill. It‚Äôs just unfair.
---
Sure, can you send me the link to the video once it comes out

Oh ok, thx. Well we mybe should have only one replay at a time, but it doesnt have 400 lock?

Oh well

Explanation: in a Siege friendly game, the bots are  extremely basic and predictable. I'm playing as Penny in the factory rush map. What I do is that I charge up my super and set my turret up at the edge of the boarder. I make sure to keep it in the bush. In the video you can clearly see them begin to approach it, then ignore it when it hits the Ike (or that Colt) Eventually they ignore it all together.
---
Witness my thiccness, but when thicness were doubled, itvwill spitvup to 4 of us, so teaming wasnt toxic anymore
---
Piper and Pam have a voice, Leon doesn't
---
5 months!? Hate to break it to you, but it should not have taken that long! Casually, it should've taken 2-3 months. If you played a lot, maybe 1.5 months.

Not "clearly" at all. Yeah, it was clutch. But it looks autoaim. There's no view of the thumb sticks so you can't claim "clearly" if even one person disagrees.

u have 275 brawler trophies

You‚Äôre right that skin they have looks nice

Ahh yes I was getting a bit hungry.

Exactly. Piper gets too much love as being high skill cap. She's not at all. Honestly, she's one of the easiest to autoaim for a brawler without a shotgun. That's just my experience though. Maybe I got "lucky" a lot.

The brawler you are using needs to be 400+ I believe. Also why did you black out the names? It's not like you can use them to friend people that requires a randomized code.

I honestly thought the word in the middle said deleted rather then defeated.

Is the glitch still working?

Who even uses Poco in showdown anymore? (Other than duos and on specific maps, yes I know)

it do be like that sometimes

I only got her after 4000 aswell. I think it's true that you get an epic one brawler in the very beginning, but I don't think it has to be the same for everyone. I got Pam, my second account got Bibi.

I mean the matchmaking is generally pretty good.... Before global release it was much worse

I would've still kept on going till I lost all of my trophies

Im outta here

So basically Bo has killed and skinned Bo for a hat and feathers for his arrows.
---
KILLING SPREE!
---
Shelly has Band aid so...
---
I really think some people in this community are ungrateful. Before Star Points all players with brawlers over 500 were complaining that there was nothing to push for. Supercell tried to fix that with Star Points and now everyone wants Token rewards back. Can you just make up your mind?
---
Also brock: gets all the skins
---
I bought it for my mini account. Already have a level 9 Shelly at rank 4
---
Whats Your opinion?
---
New or Old ?
---
I actually felt it here in Vegas and i was in bed it was scary because I thought someone was moving it.
---
We still have problem? 
---
Yes... Big Problem.
---
Lol I‚Äôm playing since global and I already have 2 legendaries
---
I still think he looks like Waluigi
---
How can I get this role?
---
Yes, of course
---
Tara's new Star Power create a shadow (like the first one) but instead of hitting enemies it heals tara and his teammates
---
That Frank could have easily smushed that Mike.there really is no honour between teamers.
---
I wish it was in the game for less than 80gems
---
It kinda reminds me the old menu before the last menu update before global
---
the remodel we need, but not the remodel we deserve
---
Imagine dashing into water with that
---
Ree of my meme
---
Bad time trio
---
Bad map
---
Wont be better than the first one imo, the Shield brings your effective Health up to 9.2k which is way better when it comes to surviving and you can tank some damage while you reload, the only scenario this SP could be useful is in Heist, where after you maybe used all of your ammo to kill an enemy you roll into the safe to get some damage done or maybe in maps where there are squishy Brawlers but you're better off using the first SP to roll safely up to them and destroy them with 3 shots.

Much needed.

Hoe it gets implemented!
---
What is fact: her healing would be reduced like every other boss's, so no full heal.
---
You can use Shelly's starpower in SD ( I did bot match) and I got her 12 power cubes. She only heals 5040, which is her leve 9/10 max hp, even though her max hp was increased to around 1100.

Yes.Now give me your account ü§ìüòî

Yes I got the Brock one

that's super specific &gt;.&gt;
---
Saw what
---
IMO box opening also don't have anything to do with luck, they just increase the probability of getting a leggy, i have seen people going upto 0.5% probability without getting any leggy and a friend of mine getting 2 mythics then a leggy in a row
---
1. &gt;People that were just joking
---
Open your eyes, the actual quote is 
---
&gt;Person that just joking
---
2. My main language is not English. Even more, my main language is not even in latin symbols
---
At least it makes her much better at close range, as auto aim is possible
---
Band aid heals you only for 5040 which is Shelly‚Äôs max hp at max level. As the big brawler, healing is reduced greatly. Thus, you only heal that amount of health
---
He's that pixel over there
---
How TF slowing movement speed during dash would decrease DPS ?
---
tara stole it
---
Bo's star power is now too weak.In past it was the best star power..
---
So now you have 40% chance of getting a legendary, good luck!
---
But wait... That's ilegal
---
Make a second account and ask about it in help and support(settings)
---
The game is now Landscape not Portrait
---
You shouldn‚Äôt hate the brawler but hate the person that third parties it. Piper is just the in game character and has no control of what the person playing her chooses to do.

That title, pathetic c:

The zero deaths he has a shirt with "zero deaths" written on. This one is zero losses

rEd nOsE wHo?

Any one of these buff will make him too op and annoying as hell. I mean, he has a weakness of low dps, but he has a wide attack range and he charges his super easily already. He‚Äôs good in Gem grab and Duo.

but i can easily dodge him

Lol, I'll take that as a good thing xD

Good point they should make it spin the other way

As a poco main with poco being my first and only brawler to 500 (the recent changes only made it faster, I got from 354 to 500 with 5 loses at most, so I know what I'm saying), I can safely say that he will be super OP if he gets any buff beyond 10 extra damage and 50 extra heal for his super
---
Just learn to use him to his full potential, which I can safely say the majority of players (top players included, or he would be at the top of tier lists, the fifth place at the very least) can't

In my opinion it looks good, because if Supercell completely remade her, people would complain even more
---
JESUS that's awesome this should be in the game RIGHT NOW
---
I think i should, It is too polemic
---
Dou
---
I don‚Äôt agree at all but ok.
---
Well I‚Äôm pretty sure the next update is gonna be at least 2 months later since supercell is on vacation.
---
Someone named u/pizza240 stole this
---
Is actually pretty useful
---
It should be enable us to dash over water, or else mortis still continues to be the only brawl who cant attack through water
---
Not really a fan of how clustered it looks tbh.

Brokennnnnn sooo broken...waiting for the lists of nerf bo in the comment section of the uploaded video

It's double spoiler, not only because of the third star Power, but Carl Skin Too
---
In the past, these offers worked for every brawler. Why the hell did this happen?

It's not op ...

It's BROKEN

I got 2 legendaries in the first week of me playing brawlstars.
---
Imagine if that Shelly had Band-Aid
---
No, I get what you're trying to say, "they're different types of games so they dont have to be similar" but still, I never saw one person tell me "yeah, I like not being able to fight back in a fast paced game for a period of time", I'm ok with Strong supers as long as they're "fun" for both sides, but ofc this is extremely subjective
---
XD

It was scary since we have not had or for a while, but we are good. Thanks for caring (even if it was in a joking way)

To be honest in my experience having a skin makes everyone target you. I won a maple barley pre release and everyone on my team in 3v3s just danced and lost is the game. Also people see you as a bigger threat
---
New update a wonderful. I mean 1000 trophy in 24 hours.
---
I completely agree with you that snare/stun mechanics can be some of the most annoying things in games. No argument there. But you haven't speculated on how Bo's stun in particular can be avoided entirely, or the utility it provides to his teammates. Maybe no one is asking for a new stun ability, but no one is asking to remove existing stuns either.
---
You wont be able to get that skin for a VERY long time üòÇ I woudlnt even worrie about it
---
This should be a skin
---
yo know what? im gonna try to make it.
---
When Jessie heals her turret with her star power the shoot bounces off to he near enemy, this is very useful to hit brawler that you cannot hit directly.
---
Yes plz

Damn this game is becoming so P2P now. Whoever has a star power will pretty much win, since all F2P players (like me) have no star power and the ones who played long probably only have very few
---
Where are you from?
---
Bout tome someone talked
---
Clubpenguin. :'(
---
ik the star power glitch but whose star power you used for pipier?
---
In solo showdown there is teamerd, and dou showdown is easier to camp for trophies.

Never true-team... only backstab!

LOL? Dou

üòâ  ot taht evah i üòâ it's backwardsüê¶

God Dame it supercell you only want money by adding even more starpowrs

I worry about its survivability tho

Original templates are almost always better.

Edgelord Penny Skin
---
This is gonna make fo some sick plays!
---
It‚Äôs not their fault, it‚Äôs Vietnamese government regulations. Supercell was pressured to change aspects of the game and they didn‚Äôt want to have to make more versions. Just download a vpn and play it anyway
---
Unexpected thanos?
---
Nah it was a glitch that was patched
---
Wait what. Its obviously not the star power swap glitch either, because no brawler with shield have it for that short amount of time
---
What private server is this?
---
How trophies you have on leon?
---
This wasn't landscape update 
---
This was one of the western theme updates or December 2017 update

You can tell by the loading BAR its still western UI loading bar

Overused like leon jokes

No, each brawler has 2 cases

Yes but Brawl Stars used to more than just getting higher in overall trophies, it was about that feeling where you achieved something difficult (other than over all trophy push )
---
And a sneaky peak at a new Carl skin as a bonus!!!

what about gene? he could pull bull

Yea I still think his first one is better

I prefer rico much more but that's just me

Can you do better?
---
You misunderstand. I‚Äôve also played since the first 2 weeks of beta release and I am quite upset alongside my friends. We don‚Äôt give 2 shits about the star points, like, they can do whatever they want with that. It‚Äôs the fact that they sort of attacked us (lol) at the same time by removing our season token rewards. I remember waking up to a text from my newbie friend after 2 weeks of waiting like: ‚Äúwhere are my boxes? Is this a bug?‚Äù Anyways, they can do wtv they want with the star points, we just want our tokens and reason to push leagues back.
---
i still don‚Äôt understand the ‚Äúat least he got there‚Äù. i thought that meant i don‚Äôt have any 500s.
---
kind of sad

You have clearly played overwatch

Heh, it would end up being always 5 shellies vs jessie/rosa/nita so idrk. Good idea tho

It's a recolor, which is fine, but it is so expensive and other star token skins are better. That'll definitely be one of my last skins. Even after touchdown Bull.

Backstabb is not a cheat, teaming is, showdown is to be a battle royale mode where everyone is fighting for them selves, people who do teams are cheating because the game is not supposed to be played like this.

Hey look, no one cares

When the only epics were bo and mortis

Ikr, Im also around 8.3k trophies and have all brawlers but leggys, bibi and gene
---
Replace the bandolier with his old bandana and it would be perfect

I've never heard of them, which is probably why.

Your chance will stay the same. You can even see your percentage of getting a legendary from the shop. It wont be high. But it wont change

Screenhot and post
---
How did you know he is a kid
---
I got u fam
---
Omg yess im sorry i didnt link you, i just forgot who originally made it
---
I mean that If I get Gene my chances will drop pretty significantly, so if they keep adding new mythics and epics I might never get a leggy right?

Don't .... Move ...... A ..... Muscle

It's so easy to push to 500 and it makes it seem like people who pushed all or most of their brawlers to 500 extremely easy :(

Its perfectly fine, Im flattered you were inspired like many others

what is this? i don‚Äôt get it

They could do a thing like: Gene's hand gives his ENEMY 300 damage when touched
---
This one is SUCKS
---
I have a couple high ranked brawlers that I grinded up but I‚Äôm really not worried about it anymore. I enjoy not being afraid to play my favorite brawlers because I don‚Äôt want to lose trophies.

On what a box? That's not certain to give me anything.

Hello?...

They could never release a new brawler and you could theoretically never get a legendary.

Cuz then you can flex that you played with him and feel good about yourself

How about a Sans inspired Poco skin instead?

Mortis looks from left to right and smiles.
---
And Bunny Penny should also blink.

It's just part of their character design. You can also seem them (e.g. Carl, Jessie, Penny, Mortis, Bibi, etc. in the Brawler Selection.

Actually I only want the hat and the gun

I like both Ricohet and Rico, so seeing both combines will make me sated :)

Yeah, but a frank super is still annoying.

I only don't have spike and I always wait for new brawlers to open boxes

Can't we have both
---
who prefers hunter lol
---
Yeah, Brock is definitely gonna need a buff after seeing this.
---
His super should subscribes is teammates
---
IMO ricochet now is much better. Vending machine like body fits him much more and gives more opportunities for skins related to this brawler. Better make some brawler which actually have headhunter like abilities than return old completely not related to Ricochesting robot model.
---
Don't use nita, but 10k
---
Why do you want it so...?
---
You are the problem that randoms are so bad. Us 10k+ players try and push with randoms and we suddenly end up in a match with you because one of your brawlers is 500 and since you don‚Äôt have skill we lose the match.
