I just got him from the offer and I feel mixed emotions. Like I‚Äôm happy but that costs a lot but oh well at least I didn‚Äôt buy skins or something. And I‚Äôm still missing spike so not like I‚Äôd pull both of them
---
Are you still able to get legendary brawler offers in the shop? Im not talking about the current leon offer cause that is very over priced and is offered to everyone. and if you look at youtuber bentimm1's video it cost him 449 gems instead of the 554 gems last month. 
---

---
Tldr. My question is will i be able to get another offer like bentimm1s offer while not owning mythic or epic brawler?
---
Thanks in advance
---
Would u know thid1
---
That‚Äôs how Mafia works
---
It seems very similar to el primo in terms of its basic attack.
---
Thats because thats exactly what it is
---
Well, i have Nita 500 trophies (although i only play only in showdown lol), but let me tell you that her bear is REALLY usefull. You can use it either for attack or defense \[Tank shots and follow the person the bear is focusing, or use it when you are running away (Like running away from a colt or ricochet)\], but don't throw it against a Bull, Shelly, Primo or Darryl, since they can kill the bear with only 2 or 3 shots. When you are facing a Dynamike or Barley, use the bear agressively (They have low health, so the bear is gonna make them back off), Try not to run away when you throw your bear against them (Unless you have low hp), since they are throwers, they can attack you even if the bear follows them, so be carefull.

It means that someone is spectating the match (Take Showdown for example, you can spectate someone playing, but you can also change the person you are spectating, the same thing for every other gamemode, even if they are your enemies)
---
I have seen even more now when I play for my mini (lower trophies). 
---
And also when I play at European morning time the number of afk in the middle of the match is huge. I assume schoolers are playing in the lessons and have to hide their phone when teacher is passing by xD

Should I feel extremely lucky that I pulled Leon out of a free brawl box?  I was shocked when I got him. Couldn‚Äôt believe it. 
---
I think bull is great for guest so is Brock and primo
---
i mean it's cool but don't fit with the cartoon brawl stars vibe
---
(Do you really get nervous by that? lol) I think the spectating thing is good, but you shouldn't be able to see your enemies when you are spectating a teamate. You can use spectating mode to see the position of every brawler in showdown, and that's cheating.
---
MY EYES
---
It‚Äôs free, sure but damn $40 is fucking steep. I feel even at $15-$20 is expensive as hell. 
---
Bull - no 
---
Leon- fuck no hes already bad enough as it is from the nerfs 
---
Crow - way too op no change
---
Nita - slightly more damage no other changes
---
Spike- completely balanced as he is he already has no health which is his weakness
---
Pam - maybe
---
Darryl - more like just bring him back how he was pre update and keep super the same
---
Richochet - no
---
The ultimate is not bad, it's the aeon it takes to get it ready that is rubbish. Quicker load and also it would be awesome if the Jump would be a double click, one to jump the other to land, a second to choose in the air type.

---
Whoa. Colt is ***hot.***
---
Yup. They aren‚Äôt that expensive 40 bucks 
---
Brock is actually decent at box collection. He would probably be seen is non-meta at lower trophy ranges where shotgunners reside more and people don't scout bushes and keep their distance. Brock is also not horrible up close as autoing his rockets deal a good bit of damage.  
---
Nice, I love this banner!
---
I like it, seems like a solid option. Kind of like Nita but more of a "IMMA SMACK YOU BITCH" kind of vibe.
---
you can play duos with different people...
---
edited about nita
---
about bull i don't regret, they won't remove auto aim, and he have a pretty ridiculous damage which is just hide in a bush and tap three times on the screen so you'll won
---
It‚Äôs only $30
---
My man! I like that way of thinking!

Excuse me but what the fuck

---
In brawl stars you are not support to main a brawler!!!
---
5v5?
---
it'll come in handy
---
For Crow, I feel like the main attack damage boost wouldn't really fit his kit and would make it a bit stale. Crow is special in a way that he can poison enemies, so I think the damage boost could go to another tick of poison or two stacks, +15% poison dmg boost.
---
I ain't paying over 20 bucks for a character for some video game. No thanks I'll be patient

This is the type of maps we need. Love this!

Well I like it

La verdad es que en ning√∫n momento pens√© en que su ataque aturidiera, solo pensaba en que empujara a los enemigos y nada m√°s. No se me hab√≠a pasado por la cabeza el que pueda aturdir, lo cual me parece una buena idea (pero solamente lo provocar√° el super, el b√°sico solamente empuja pero no anula ataques o super). Con respecto a la rareza creo q va bien por ahora m√≠tico (especialmente porq solo hay dos m√≠ticos) , sin embargo bien podr√≠a ser √©pico tamb.  Gracias por darme tu opini√≥n e idea, si llego a suber una edici√≥n de la imagen seguramente agregar√© y explicar√© bien lo del aturdimiento. 
---
The spawn when you get killed and when you spawn after a score 
---
Aaaaaa lottttt
---
1. It's your fault for not checking bushes before entering
---
2. It's kind of Bull's kit for camping. What else is he going to do? Run straight up to you can get 10 colt bullets in his face? He needs a way to get close in order to do damage. You might as well ask why doesn't Piper run into shotgun range and start attacking.

Description: A brand new showdown map like no other map in the game! The map consists of many open areas with some cacti spread throughout them, buy also many walls, some of which are a decent length, which I feel should make the map interesting. Also contains a very unique middle and it‚Äôs not a 4-way symmetrical middle, and the boxes are spread throughout it, another interesting end-game I‚Äôd say! Many unique areas and interactions should always keep this map interesting!

You're lucky to get Mortis as a mythic. I only got him because he was an epic, and that was around 3k trophies.
---
I got Crow at 7.5k, and I'm still missing Leon and Spike (9k now)...

I know haha. There are a lot of things in the game that are completely aesthetic

Wrong subreddit

I think the normal attwck needs a nerf cause el primo caanr touch it

Well in always tought it was completely normal (my progression was as slow too) but seeing all the new players get legendarys and having 17 brawlers below 2k make it seem like its bad luck

That moment when your aggro picks up all the gems you dropped

What does it mean?

Bull needs a range buff
---
I only see a yellow background 
---
The point is to have regional exclusives. It‚Äôs actually a very good idea. You shouldn‚Äôt be able to choose other countries skins because you are not from that country.
---
His introduction may actually decrease usage of shotgunners such as bull and Shelly, and if his pushback effect resets franks Attack animation he could totally kill frank in the meta. His auto attack may need some balancing to Ensure that it isn‚Äôt too op and doesn‚Äôt kill a whole class of brawlers. But overall great art and concept! 
---
Shut up bitch 
---
That‚Äôs coach cory, one of the best brawl stars youtubers. Since the beta launch
---
Only makes sense. It's showdown so if two people are playing characters deemed weak by the community and they spawn close to a character deemed to be the best by the community they should be working together. It's just like if there are three people left and two of them have 3 power ups or something like that but they have the ability to take down the other person who has 16 power ups then there is every reason to work together, after all who doesn't want the extra trophies?
---
This is why I think getting a kill should provide someone with an invulnerability shield OR 1 trophy per kill. Because it's not fun when you outmaneuvered 3 people and killed all of them just to die to a bush camper.
---
The thing happening in your screenshot is what I would call cooperative interests which is not as toxic as **teaming**. 
---
Yup
---
I think this can be considered more than a guess. Why would they sell him to everyone? In the past supercell pushes these kinds of deals while brawlers or cards (in the case of CR) are too strong. When everyone has already spent money to get the OP thing, then they bring it down a notch. Leon is currently considered to be the best brawler in almost every single mode. And that speaks serious volumes towards how unbalanced he is, so as I said, we can pretty confidently say that he will be nerfed sometime in the near future. 
---
For a fucking character. 
---
Dynamikes:
---
A lot of people actually did get the Leon offer today, congratulations!
---
I also bought it. Wishing for the best of luck with your Leon pushing! :D
---
With Apple you can ask for a refund no question asked. 
---
Looks fine to me tbh
---
Frank?
---
Because you live in Ukraine. And I'm guessing you're not the one that created this club?  I think the game takes the location of the original leader as club's location.
---
Ahh i see. Thank you! I apologize.
---
we cant really answer this btw

just send the following:
---
can i talk to an actual moderator on help and support? no ofenses, but the auto bot doesn't undertand me :c

i sent that and since then only mods talk to me, no mor auto bot!
---
hope it helps :3
---
Okperono
---
We don‚Äôt do that here lol
---
Except I'm f2p
---
Bull has more hp and damage per attack than Shelly, yet can be absolutely destroyed with Shelly super. Shelly super is one of the strongest in the game, not to mention the stun, which basically allows her to destroy brawlers with super windups. 
---
Seems you‚Äôre new to the game. Here‚Äôs a tip. Check bushes before walking into them or you‚Äôll be sorry 
---
I‚Äôll Krump with you sweetie pie
---
I agree completely with your suggestions for Shelly and Mortis, but here‚Äôs what I think about the others:
---
Darryl - It wasn‚Äôt fun knowing you were always going to play a Darryl and he could go right past you so a rework was needed to make him viable in other areas. I think a half tile super buff would be good and maybe a slower auto recharge (I don‚Äôt like the idea of auto recharge). Also a slight health buff. 
---
Crow - I feel like 4 daggers would too many/too wide. Many people have suggested super recharging quicker but I always feel reluctant to use his super and think a damage buff would be better. 
---
Spinning in place as a signal to team with each other.
---
Was the joke in the last sentence intended?
---
That is pretty cool!
---
Thing is, we can just request refunds because we bought Leon in the pretense that he was a good character. To nerf Leon after people spent gems to buy him on sale would be a shady business practice by Supercell, in which Apple would probably honor the refund to avoid backlash.
---
You forgot Leon
---
this look like an old map of mine .-.
---
liked it tho...
---
Great work my man!
---
Indeed.
---
Compared to most other games, Brawl Stars is already very un-pay to win, where you can basically max for about $1000, unlike some other games, where it's impossible to be anywhere near the competitive level without spending at least say 10 grand.
---
Being able to set a higher priority target, like a safe in heist or gem carrier etc.
---
I believe in Jesus. I worded it out incorrectly. I‚Äôm not offended
---
I think Colt wins.
---
Lol
---
Sorry
---
**I want that Leon whatever it looks like.**
---
Well original crow got his super waaaaay faster and dealt a bit more damage 
---
My suggestion wouldn‚Äôt make his shooting range wider, it would be the same width but with 4 daggers instead of 3 
---
This is super cool! Now if only I could find some people to play with... ;-;
---
BTW, is there any reason that Aggro is left and Support is right? Is it just because of the cover on that particular map?
---
Nah Daryl is a pirate
---
I like the theme. Take my upvote!
---
This changes everything I thought of for barley
---
*We don‚Äôt follow people here wakanda meme*
---
Not sure yet :(
---
Ooh nice idea fam I would love it personally 
---
The power levels are perfectly fine. Even that max Mike only has 20% more base stats than a power 5 Dynamike, so it mostly comes down to skill, unlike Clash Royale, where a card being 3 levels higher than yours is a very reasonable excuse to lose.
---
Cries in dynamike
---
They both stuck too

Ah............... well prepare to be homeless
---
Dang, rip me. Thanks for the info :)

I see what you did there at the bottom left corner, and I love it. Bullieve my words with an upvote!

Thanks. However I forgot Big Game was in the Showdown format so Im gonna repost it really quick :)
---
Idk either 
---
For sure mate. The other ideas aren‚Äôt too bad
---
I love all of these ideas! One of my main problems with Clash Royale was that it started with a good variety of cards, but they kept on releasing legendaries, so that there were as many legendaries as all the rest of the cards combined. I really hope that this doesn't happen in Brawl Stars, where there are like 10 legendaries, and the other rarities are completely ignored.
---
Oh yeah
---
There are very very *very* few hackers in Clash Royale, if any. What are you saying mate?

So are you going to get it? 
---
It's a nice skin! I just wish they would fix his overall look though.
---
I know.
---
Did you spend the 50 at the start?
---
No. Trophy road never resets. If you have any brawlers above 500, you lose half of the trophies you have over 500.
---
I could see a short video with this kind of animation, and I like it! :)
---
Take my upvote!
---
Seems like it would be better on scorched stone
---
So everyone that doesn‚Äôt have all legendaries already has one in the shop? All 4 of my accounts have Leon available. 
---
That‚Äôs just sad
---
Um...the problem there is that I'm getting matched with 900 trophy teammates because they are one tricking a brawler and have most of their trophies with that one brawler. They suck and I end up losing with em.
---
Your not wrong but I still think that‚Äôs a lot of money to have laying around 
---
T h r o w e r s
---
It very well may be the case that there is a bug in their software, where when they created new legendary drop chances and how they increase when you don't get a legendary, maybe it didn't apply properly. We need actual statistics about how many boxes it takes for everyone in different groups to get a legendary.
---
I got two legendaries within about a year and I started playing when the game came out, and I bought Leon when he came out. 
---
What does the chance of legendary drop say for you? Since you haven't had any yet it might be pretty high. If it's like 1-2% then you should get one in a hundred boxes so if you open hundreds and get none then you are either very unlucky or their algorithm for increasing chance is not working properly.
---
It was

How many trophies do you have mate how many and what‚Äôs your username, I‚Äôd love to see your progression on brawlstars to see if you know even half the stuff you claimüëÖüëÄüò§üòÇ

The amount of people who absolutely missed the obvious sarcasm in this thread...
---
The difference is that you are making a low effort **post**, and I did a comment. 
---
Bull is used at low trophies because he is easy to use. As simple as that. Also, would love to see the proof that he is the most used one, and that 5/8 matches
---
Wait the more you pull the less chances you have? Because I just got Tara and frank today which I don‚Äôt like so will I have no chances of getting spike and piper (who I want)
---
Wins has nothing to do with how many brawlers you should have. What are your brawlers‚Äô levels around
---
Just got him in a box! Finally my first legendarily üòµ just reached 6.5k. Best day ever!
---
Brilliant
---
r/BrawlStarsCompetitive have great tips
---
Support brawlers are usually sharpshooters whose job is to keep opponents from killing the gem carrier. Also, Poco is a gem carrier.
---
haha it is really funny because beyblade spin
---
Why would anyone ever team with a shotgunner?  Then again, there are a lot of really dumb people in this game.
---
150. It‚Äôs a legendary skin
---
Wow, kid, were all those emojis necesary? And no, obviously you are at low trophies, 3k right? Anyways, you don't deserve my time, keep crying for a Bull nerf
---
Lowest rank is 13, got like 3-4 brawlers on 13-14, rest is 15-17
---
I have spent $50 dollars on the game and idk if that affects anything, but I still don‚Äôt think it should be enough for me to get 3 legendaries in 10 days! Also plz don‚Äôt hate on me for spending
---
That's cool! Love your work, sorry for so many questions but but long have you been drawing? 
---
Hey man don't worry. Your chances are still going up little by little each time you open them. It just visually changes on the brawl box info screen when you reach a percentage milestone. And if you are above .10% it takes a ton of boxes to visually change
---
I assume you‚Äôre quite young first off... so maybe keep your word on your device and maybe ask your dad/mom/sibling to create an account on their device and play at home. Say you‚Äôll do the dishes for the week in return.
---
Alright, that makes a lot of sense
---
What is this, a crossover episode?
---
Sorry about that 
---
No I meant like how many power levels because that‚Äôs a good gage of how many boxes you have opened usually
---
I got 400 coins and a key doubler from the mega box... what a waste of 40 gems.
---
That would be a great skin
---
Wow I want to draw the Simpsons 
---
How about start with maybe one or two subtle changes?.... not just outright kill a brawler.

Hahah says the one that said ‚Äúlol‚Äù I am at 9565 btw and I know the game pretty well. Listen these are my personal opinions. So if rather you keep your garbage off my post if you have no ideas. For Instance a good comment would be ‚Äúhmm I don‚Äôt completely agree on all of those, I think that spike is too over powered already.‚Äù   That is a fair helpful comment or, ‚ÄúI personally think auto-aim should be removed from the game cause it takes away the whole skill aspect‚Äù.   See what I mean, if you don‚Äôt have something constructive to say hop off reddit in general man üë®. 
---
It isn‚Äôt hate. It‚Äôs the truth. You post a screenshot of a win with no context and you‚Äôre upset that I called it useless? Grow up, kid.
---
You know what? You probably are a kid. In that case, I‚Äôm sorry. Don‚Äôt post useless stuff next time, though.
---
Or just learn to put your finger where you want it lol. If gaming is good for something, it does help with some hand/eye coordination 
---
Lots of us literally can‚Äôt get anything out of chests because we are maxed out or are only missing legendaries so we save them to get new brawlers as soon as they come out
---
‚ÄúDumbo‚Äù IS in his name...
---
If you have a maxed out account, there‚Äôs no reason to open them. So people save them until a new brawler gets released.
---
Another reason would be to feel like you‚Äôre having significant pulls as opposed to 20 coins here, 7 power points there, etc.
---
besides botting idk what hackers

---
Congrats! Both are pretty good brawlers
---
Your luck factor increases with every box you don‚Äôt unlock a brawler. So yes it‚Äôll be a lot harder to pull more brawlers from boxes now that you unlocked 2 so quickly. But the longer you wait and more boxes you open the better the odds get.
---
Hahahaha, noice
---
Well i only play when i have tokens up and did max time with all my tickets during last robo defense
---
This friend pushes trophies during binge sessions and will go days without playing and skips weekend events
---
Ah, whatever makes ya happy. 
---
And your a rico 
---
It is Leon
---
Neither
---
*What the fuck did u say to me to little shit?!* 
---
This kinda reminds me of Black Mage from final fantasy
---
1 like = 1 pray for this dynamike
---
I honestly just don't like the idea of bull. The idea of playing him feels dirty to me, seeing as all of his strategies are pretty dickey. I do play a ton of Darryl though, who is pretty much cyberbull. Also with Colt it's not that I really HATE him, he's just really lackluster compared to other sharpshooters. I also like Rico and Brock is super fun to play. Colt is just kinda meh.
---
Yeah it's kinda the point
---
Was thinking about it but I see a lot of people with leon now, seems that deal is being released to everyone. It doesn't seem to be as good and unique anymore. Facing two to three leon per showdown as oppose to once in awhile like before the deal was made to everyone. 
---
Someone arleady had this idea
---
Something about how this sub has become so immature and this isn't even funny.
---
Just wait 10 seconds, it'll show up
---
Take the post down then, you don‚Äôt deserve the karma anyways
---
Next up, a discreet increase in drop rate for F2P players.
---
Perfectly balanced, as all things should be.
---
Ik
---
So cool
---
not bad, but brawler merges with the background
---
What you‚Äôre trying to say here isn‚Äôt exactly correct, brawler rarities are based on the uniqueness of the brawler, so this means that commons are just as good as legendaries, only less unique.
---
This doesn‚Äôt seem like the type of thing to post about
---
I'd choose the Leon one, you know why
---
Too be fair, I don't even own any legendaries so I have no idea what his exact stats are; I think they should shorten his poison in exchange for more damage or vice versa to completely change how hes played. Beta player BTW. Oh and I still haven't unlocked mortis.
---
That's my mindset. Shelly is usually who I play in Showdown, but Nita is my best. I played solo once, and it was a win with Nita. Bull got most of his trophies from Heist.
---
Darryl takes more skill than Bull to really take advantage of his potential. And I agree, Colt is incredibly lackluster.
---
The colors and lighting are a bit off, but that's fine. You have great ideas but you need to plan out the proportions and looks. Always remember to practice your linework, it feels a bit clunky. I'm fine with the way Leon looks in this pic. I love the way you used a clear background so that we could focus more on your artwork, nice job! You thought 7/10 things that would make leon in this piece amazing. Not bad at all! 
---
There are so many shotguns running around, who barely team because it‚Äôs so easy to backstab
---
Happy cake day
---
Great idea!!! Love it! Just think it would cause alottaaaaa lag to switch bgs everytime
---
Yeah,I'm a new artist so I'm still learning
---
That's fine. Always remember to practice a bit more to improve and perfect your art skills. 
---
Well if u see their power levels r almost equal to ours but colt guy messed it up bcz he was noob or who knows ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
It‚Äôs possible to win with just about everybody at that trophy level lol
---
Yeah i mean there is only 2 possible directions that the robots come from.
---
I mean this seems like the type of thing you‚Äôd tell your friends, not post. It‚Äôs just not interesting because that type of stuff is normal.
---
Que es eso de la foto??
---
Just got most of mine too rank 11, gonna try and push them all to 13 (3 of 18 there), but just unlocked bo and frank so catching them up now
---
Tron time
---
I would defenetly love that, although I do think that people would nearly always choose the country germany because they would get Leon for free
---
This skin is dope! Really good! But you shouldn't just beg for them to add it. Put it as a "hey guys, look at this skin concept I made, I hope you like it!" Instead of begging to add the damn thing

Those are just rookie numbers

Thanks! Updated

How would they even change the country to get that specific skin???? When it's already locked as in SPARTA
---
Yes anything that make the chameleon tongue doesn't look like his nose
---
Make the other target a more viable option and generally people will jump on it 
---
Imagine Supercell adds premium, 300+ gems skins that can change the lobby background when you use it..

Anyways, nice concept! I think it should be named "Interstellar Colt"

Nice idea

This is really well made, but it's not a good idea to put it in the game. The amount of people who couldn't play because of the insane lagg would be way too big.

Yes

Ok, 1. Just because everyone else is doing it, it‚Äôs ok? And 2. I personally just don‚Äôt like the way it‚Äôs marked as on sale, as if they didn‚Äôt just sell it for what they want and mark up the slashed price. It‚Äôs not like I can go to Leon‚Äôs page and purchase him with gems whenever I want at the higher price.

This almost looks 3d

Probably will come down the line. It's still a new game. :)

True i agree with you totally  every Brawler has his style of play idk why are people so fixated on wanting to nerf leon?
---
:(
---
4 minutes 2 seconds is a good time
---
His normal attacks need to be 1 hit kill and his super recharge every micro seconds so you can spam bats everywhere haha haha 
---
Nice play ! ;)
---
Er the weekly even gives you 2 tickets whis is equal to 64 tokens if ur skilled enough

I font Like Digimon but that would ne a heck of a skin

It‚Äôs based on rank not level

WOAH

HOW WHAT WHERE

I really like it but the star power seems to be so OP.... 
---
Just started playing again and got 2 legendaries but no mythic 
---
Yeah and that is not nice
---
Well you're the worst. Out of all the brawlers you picked barley? Why? Sure it might have worked when the maps weren't as large as showdown but come on! El primo is more useful!
---
If you want to complain about randoms, either use the best brawler you have OR get enough trophies so you won't face noobs OR go form a team yourself!

Sorry my dude but the stats don‚Äôt lie

Well that‚Äôs my bad then, didn‚Äôt know they changed I bought all the packs before they removed tokens.
---
mumscreditcardwillsurvive
---
No. There would be to much skilled players that know how to avoid bull. This is an treu achievement no Matter what brawler. Especially bull since he isn't that good in high trophies. People like colt would kill him all day cause of range and bush checking. 
---
Looks cool
---
nice one lmao
---
Supercell, please add this
---
Likeeee
---
Sign it, and upload with a digital watermark. This way even if someone puts something over the watermark, you have the sign to prove for it. 
---
Thank you, that might be it.
---
self praise is no praise lol
---
Sealy by using 10 tickets and token doubled you almost get 5 boxes
---
No it happened to me too, after a little it went to like 0.1536. It goes very slowly like every 20 boxes it goes up
---
Love it but I think a different color would be better...
---
Cause the original Leon is green as well and maybe red
---
Hmm maybe i will make another one! Thanks for the feedback.
---
Wow! That's really cool! Can you post a picture about the painting irl? Im interested to see it
---
Where is the star in the middle?

Yeah i was thinking about that i have a a samsung galaxy j5(6) is it good ? I was searching if there is any thing i could do to boost it or smthn...

I agree with you on that

I know, this isn't art, but i think this work will be well appreciated.
---
(There may be mistakes because I'm Russian.)
---
I contacted Supercell they said that I was just lucky to get it in a row like this. However I think its because ,as someone else mentioned, I maxed all my powerpoints for other brawlers!
---
Can also mean the f word
---
Nice to know :D
---
And you didnt buy mega boxes either?
---
OK. 
---
Wow! This is one of the coolest ones I've seen!
---
From what angle
---
I dunno... I guess from above since you can see the whole painting?
---
Ok wait
---
Cool but a bit too dark
---
Super coolüòé
---
Beyblade
---
Balanced.
---
He is too strong. They can buff his super a bit but his damage is crazy. He shouldn't kill shotgunners from close range. Pushed him to 400 on level 2 alone almost without losing one match. It took me only few hours. He isn't completely OP, but still needs a nerf.
---
ohhhhhh. forgot about that.
---
Trop beau
---
Maybe if the background fit in with the art style.. It looks a little too realistic for the game.
---
Hard countered by bull?? He can deal the Bull's maximum damage from 3 times the range and can't be reduced by running away due to the insane projectile speed. He can outrun bull due to his speed too. So the only way for bull to kill Leon is for Leon to be incredibly bad and not throw an auto to check the bush, a tactic even most beginner players do.
---
Lol the truth is that I can easily defeat long range brawlers and throwers but not tanks and brawlers who deal more damage at close range.üòÇüòÇ
---
Its a joke lol
---
I think your right. These pass few days, I been facing alot more Leon. I think I am just going to wait and continue using my gems on double points.
---
Yes I know, I‚Äôm just not going to change the video... the video is 3 weeks old. 
---
LOVE THIS üòÇüòÇ
---
Lmao what
---
Bro Is it ok if I do it when I'm sober cos where I live it's late night and I'm really high sooooo
---
Yes that is true about complexity but nonetheless there are brawlers that can defeat leon not straightforward but with some tactics or so and how would they nerf him ?
---
Ok...
---
it looks so good
---
Hello, please give me a link
---
Really?... Mine is a Samsung Galaxy J3, and it works really decent.
---
Wow what level was he? 10?
---
He said a f2p player would never max out an account. Not true.
---
This guy had some good points
---
&gt;Holy crap I'm not going to finish this post. Get to the point. I feel like you've never played a f2p game? 95% of them are huge grinds even if you do pay.  
---
  
---
What's misleading about the IAP? You claim the IAPs are not what they appear to be, but you never explain why....  
---
The people who have high rank play more, and that's bad? You say that the leaderboard is full of people that grind, and competitive people wouldn't like that from the onset? Have you ever played any competitive anything? "Grinding" is also called "practice." Where the person who practices most usually is better, and therefore higher rank.  
---
I'd definitely pay forty dollars for that...
---
I bought the level 25 offer and got crow from it. Best 10$ spent for far.
---
You're maxed on power points at 5k?
---
This is a masterpiece
---
Why did you post this. 
---
It's because you maxed power point for all other brawlers, and Mortis is the only one remaining
---
For Switzerland have Nita and a St. Bernard dog.
---
I only paid 49 üíé for mine
---
This would actually work! And it fits so well! Well done!
---
Well that sure as hell looks nothing like bull
---
I wonder how people draw such drawings with a beautiful detail, great art
---
Sorry I meant to do Phoenix Crow
---

Thx

How can people have that amount of gems, tickets, and gold without spending money? lol
---
A match full of Leons
---
Wow that sucks. I opened a lot of mega boxes from offers and just missing legendaries and Tara. Got all my brawlers from brawl boxes haha
---
You deserve my upvote sir!
---
Yep same issue here 
---
Uh yes it is, look at the screenshot where he says he only gained +2 for a win
---
Awesome idea! üòÉ
---
Fun Fact! There is a Leon near the 'safe'  which you cannot see. So leon wins
---
Oh looks great too
---
Why do you spend 20 tickets with randoms? Are you crazy? lol
---
Woah thats awesome 
---
Just beware the meteors!
---
That‚Äôs how mafia works
---
I'm reporting you for hacking me
---
I started two weeks ago and literally only still need spike and crow (and two trophy brawlers)
---
I guess luck was on my side.
---
Feel sorry for you man, hang in there, will make getting one feel even more satisfying..
---
Thats cool and all but i think that we won't get it just because there's a chance that it will make the game lag 
---
Piper's bombs land in a random uncontrollable pattern, and you also need to be right beside the terrain to destroy it. I know you're only ranking them by 'power', but in terms of usefulness (and power) Colt beats Piper
---
Apprectiate it!!!
---
If you are unable to get In a tryhard 3 stack Snd never lose then you are not a top player. It‚Äôs fine if you lose once, if you‚Äôre getting sniped but not winnning 95% of your games
---
It's a low quality remix of it.
---
I started it yesterday before they announced the contest, currently working on my submission for it!!!
---
Same has happened to me
---
I never thought I'd see the day where footage rose of Mortis being unlocked by Chips. Rest in peace old Mortis, rest in peace his real hat, rest in peace the best era of Brawl Stars.
---
I never thought a robot bartender that throws poison could look so gosh darn cute.
---
Remove the 1 tile gaps and it'll be good
---
Nani?!
---
Same here, buddy. Just wait, you will get one eventually.
---
Yeah I was just joking that the mythic‚Äôs price is pretty high but my autocorrect changed it and I didn‚Äôt realise till now.
---
Just open some free boxes! üëçüèª
---
Is there a dead mouse in his mouth?
---
Buff the real Mortis. Leave the ones without the hat to suffer.
---
Darryl is pretty good in Showdown and gem Grab. Dependa on map but in ge eral He is useful
---
Could you possible format all that information. It‚Äôs a mess.
---
sorry we can't see the picture very well maybe repost it in a less dark area?
---
Bull and Shelly can take down any Leon
---
First All Might and now Piper? Come in people! 
---
United States of America**
---
That picture is off the house! Upvote.
---
Your Mortis buff will make him even stronger in brawl ball and that's why they won't make that change even if it's good for other games. 
---
Your crow buff will make him OP, change 1 thing st a time and see where he lands then buff him again if needed. Your leon buff is too harsh IMO, the only change he really needs to see (again just my opinion) is a reload speed decrease. This way he gets punished more for poking at long range and missing while trying to build his ult, and when he does get his ult and dives in he has to wait longer between when he 1 shots people, which will allow them to get back, so basically he only has the option to remove one person at a time instead of two. Frank doesn't need a nerf, he's easy to counter and his strengths are the only thing that make him even remotely viable. 
---
Again just my opinions but. 
---
Yeah battlefront has come a long way
---
The disrespect.
---
The two different times i thought of leaving for real gave me a legendary in the next box. Different boxes about 3 weeks apart.
---
Did you try to turn off and on again your phone?
---
Any cracked screens? If not, then does it do it when your phone is hot? If not both, the I don‚Äôt know. 
---
Oh man as an artist this really isn't nice, all people learn and art is somewhere you constantly grow. You don't have to label it as any cringe or at least not be so explicit, art takes time to be created and you should at least give some respect to the creator. Make some constructive criticism if you want to see better art because being rude with no reason to an artist won't help them in any way. 
---
Makes lots of sense! Fits in with the spike theme really well! Upvote.
---
What changed? Just those guns on his back?
---
Yeah good call. Tbh when I made the post, I was under the impression it was a really rare offer as I had read on other posts that it was a rare offer. Felt kinda silly about it after the fact. Think I am going to not do it and save the gems 
---
yeah me too lol. i live in a canada and if u were to buy it with like the normal gem deals, it would cost 50 bucks lol
---
No cracks. Didn't consider the hot phone I'll try to look into that thanks!
---
Upvote. When his hammer uses it's super, Brawlers who get caught know they might as well read what is inscribed in it.

---
This is some good stuff. Upvote.

I completely agree at first he seemed way too op but acturally it's pretty hard to play him without your super. Yeah his damage is a little too high, but that could be easily patched.

Me too, I'm only at 2000 cause I got the game a week ago but it's just for Rumble so IDC (IDC in general it's fun to play with anyone). Definitely works if you want to add me! I have a level 7 bull and 5 Jesse so you can take whichever you prefer, we just need to find a Pam :)

---
Hm. That's how the Brawl Community works. 
---
im also maxed at around 5k, but only 18 brawlers, and cards only lol
---
Fun tip when playing Leon: Hold your super so your character model appears to have the glowing rotating yellow circle and walk into a bush when you see an enemy. Hide in that bush but do not use your super just yet. The enemy will think you have just gone invisible and is going straight for them. Sit back and enjoy as they frantically shoot everywhere in panic. Then you could actually super and kill them finally :D Works best in showdown
---
Idk
---
Lol How does one do that?
---
Got lvl 8 Jessie and lvl 7 Pam (Although i play Robo Rumble with Nita)
---
There a fix for this? Same thing happens on clash royale. Constant lag. Unplayable. I have fiber internet and a good modem. I have no issues with other games or apps or devices. Really aggrevating
---
Nice work! Upvote for realism. 
---
Oh dude you're such a bad guy please leave me alone that's words hit me so bad please stop :(
---
Perfect! Would you be willing to try it out with Pam? The healing circle comes in clutch and it's a lot of consistent close/medium/long range damage in one character. Feel free to add me! I have my username and club above :)

Looks very kid-friendly, and I love it. It fits in with the Brawl Stars cartoonish action theme, and for this reason, I give you my most sincere and biggest upvote!

I‚Äôve been playing since soft launch and got both all common and most rare and super rare brawlers. The I Got both Mythics and then the rest of the super rares and rares. I pulled piper(epic) 2018 July and have opened over 500 normal brawl boxes and about 50 big boxes. I had a 0.09something legendary luck and it‚Äôs increased to 0.1014 but I still don‚Äôt have Pam frank(epics) or any legendaries. 
---
No one like him.
---
WOWWW CAT SKIN YESSS
---
I just happened to hit 2300 trophies after a couple games with him.
---
Please reply to my reply so you don't spam the chat and i am just use to saying card from CR
---
Its not the importent thing XD
---
What anime?
---
When you have all your other brawlers maxed you only get leon pp. I opened 50 boxes yesterday after buying him and got him up to 6 almost 7. And before you ask I‚Äôm also missing spike that‚Äôs why I didn‚Äôt bother opening the boxes before buying him because if I pulled one I‚Äôd just buy the other
---
I don't think I have the picture that's why I took a picture of it
---
you would be surprised.
---
You‚Äôre missing almost the whole point. Play other brawlers until you have the time/resources to max Shelly out. You‚Äôll get a bunch of stuff from the trophy road, and you‚Äôll figure out how to counter other brawlers in the process.
---
Perfect

LinkÔºü
---
Mortis don‚Äôt need a buff

I feel like teaming to take onto a stronger oponent is just human nature doing its thing. Besides that, i donr agree with it

My other brawlers are at 6 to 8 except leon. Had about 20brawl boxes and got no pp for leon. Sure its all rng but that luck thoo

Oh then maybe you should push with a brawler that your good with/enjoy using that is higher in trophies or push with friends that have lower trophies than you but make sure they‚Äôre the party leader so you get matched with people around yours and theirs trophies range

What have I done to ya? I'm not a n*azi. I'm not part of the AfD! Ps: ya write it with one "t". And now think about what ya wrote! Things, that were done, when my grandgrandgrandpa lived aren't a cause for downsizing my post and talk to me like this!

---
Well I got a new XP level, in a 3m 27s roboassault match with the token doubler. Well, thanks to that I got 2 brawl boxes.
---
I‚Äôve already acknowledged that. I think you are missing my point. I like to play Shelly. I‚Äôve played other characters before just because I don‚Äôt grind all my characters evenly doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm playing the game wrong. Will getting 3k trophies get me a lvl 10 Shelly. NO it won‚Äôt. Time will get me a lvl 10. It took a week just to afford an upgrade. I highly doubt that grinding my characters across the board will somehow grant me more resources than I‚Äôm already getting.

Not what I meant

Dude... How?

Yeah, i understand , but aint that unfair for new new players?

Thank you

This game is honestly mainly based on children aged 8-14. I doubt you're above 15 if you're mad about this subreddit being based on 11 year old kids.
---
Ikr. Spending $20 dollars on a game you play a lot is no big deal. But when you‚Äôre 11 and you have no way of getting money besides asking your mom and dad.. yeah I get the frustration. Do you know what $20 dollars is in the real world? It‚Äôs nothing. People need to stop complaining about paying for the game and stop polluting this sub

Hey man, cool blog post, good start for a first post. Feel like you could clean it up a bit, maybe add some images or format the text to make it easier to read. But otherwise, hope you come up with more content.

You mean you made spike?

I'd buy switch for that

This is it chief

I agree 
---
No teaming just a little contribution üòá
---
Actually, that's a good idea.

Yeah before it explodes. The direct hit does a lot more damage. Also for team kills his super with a couple of normal attacks can 3v1 pretty easily

Queria que o Esqueleto Gigante estivesse no Brawl Stars que o modo de jogo dele funcionaria assim:
---
PODER DE ATAQUE(barras laranjas): Tipo o El Primo, mais ele so ataca 2 vezes(cada bra√ßo do ataque level maximo daria 750 de dano)
---
ESPECIAL: Lan√ßar a bomba que ele carrega nas costas(2300 de dano, Nivel Maximo daria 3400 de dano)
---
STAR POWER: ao morrer o Esqueleto Gigante faz com que a sua bomba caia, (√°rea da bom do especial do Dyna) que em dano, possuira 4900 de dano, seria um Verdadeiro estourooo.

RARIDADE: √âpico em homenagem ao Clash Royale

it‚Äôs rare lol he never plays heist

Barley is one of the strongest brawlers, and balanced at the same time. He is way better than Dynamike, and maybe a little stronger than Brock. He barely needs a buff, he is balanced
---
Well I'm not buying them to get Leon, I'm buying them for the power points
---
I guess they always miss, huh?
---
Stick a fork in me, I'm done
---
delete it please its mine post lol
---
Littarly just pressing any %. What does the 2% change? What interaction would it change, why would rico only need 40 health more etc. This balance idea is crap + without any explaination
---
Google it bruh

I could way the same for pam

This happened with me earlier when I played bull .
---
I think you don't get how his attack works...

---
ok, I just don't want to fuck up like this guy, can I keep the same name?
---
Mhm okay thanks, was asking a feedback since I am stacking boxes and I can't tell for sure 
---
People literally get their friends together and queue up at the same exact time. They are pretty much guaranteed top 4 as they alone take 25% of the map and coordinate to take out everyone else in their way
---
Fuck no Leon doesn't need a health nerf, crow is already good at his job he doesn't need a buff, Frank is already good, where is pam, and and u forgot to buff Mortis super damage 
---
Stop being ungrateful. One brawl box is a huge upgrade from 25 PP seeing how a brawl box can have 40+ PP plus gold. The alternate reward should just be 50 gold.

Base Damage on Darryl isn‚Äôt a problem. It‚Äôs the fact he can barely hit all of his shots unless he‚Äôs really in their face. Imo a better buff would be to tweak the accuracy of the shotguns or make his attack animation shorter so it can‚Äôt be dodged as easily

Frank should be reworked, where he does insane damage up close that diminishes as the shock wave travels. Right now he crushes squishy brawlers but gets shredded if a bull or primo can close the distance
---
what do you mean by "puts that way"? I just don't know if Switch joystick designed the way it could evaluate not only direction but also the "range". I am not sure about it. 
---
But for example I would love to see Brawl Stars to work with Black Shark one side pad since movement control only needs direction. 
---
He's trying new things ;)
---
He functions decently as a shotgun from what I've seen, and the poison means they can't heal. He seems more as a jack of all trades to me. Granted I've never played him before.

Same
---
Oh ok. Then you should probably let all the others saying you stole this know too
---
Why at 6:15?
---
IMO frank doesn‚Äôt need a buff but that‚Äôs only because I think his damage is really high anyways. If they made him faster and lowered his damage a bit then I‚Äôd agree with that 100%.

Yes it can, the analog stick can determine range too, it's like when you play a game like Zelda, where if you move the analog stick to the end it runs but if you just move it a little it walks slowly.

Actually the person who said "Supercell games way superior wtf r u talking about" was comparing mobile games to fully fledged AAA games, which is why I pointed out that if they were actually superior they would be able to sell them for a lot more money.

And EA has a few extremely successful cash cow mobile games like Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes, but saying their mobile game is superior SWBF2 is really stupid, because if it was they could sell it for real money too, but they can't.

How many times I gotta tell y‚Äôall your using Darryl wrong. If people understood how to play him he would be one of the most op brawlers in the game. I grinded 300 trophies with him in one day.
---
I totally agree. The game would be better and would require more skill without it

I don‚Äôt think he needs anything. He is a perfect specimen.

I have felt this way many times but usually for the opposite team.

Username checks out

Yea, also the only two brawlers I see 3/4 of the time are either Bull or Shelly. 
---
You're not a piece of garbage. You spend your money for what you want
---
I bought him too, and for me he's a bit too much op for now. It was way easier to push to 200 trophies than any other brawler, even without any upgrade
---
Why wouldn‚Äôt she?
---
try gimp.
---
this is the best ms paint i've ever seen so you'd probably be a god

There would be no need and they would have to make new servers because the Nintendo edition would be way easier to control then a phone

---
He's pretty underwhelming UNTIL you unlock his star power. 
---
If you have Brawlers maxed or have all the power points to max it those are transformes into coins. So the more Brawlers you max(or the more power points you have on brawlers to theoratically max them) the more gold you receive.
---
Fake
---
I had it too, mutliple times
---
I killed the app if my settings every time it happened and it kinda worked
---
Darryl is my favourite. I like him especially after his rework, where he builds his super faster. This change drastically changed the way he is played. In my opinion, he does not really need a buff. If he was to get one, however, I‚Äôd say to give him a slight damage buff, but that‚Äôs it!
---
There's already m+kbm players that crush
---
Looks like Clash of clans loading screen!
---
Someone already hit 18k
---
The person that you wanted to attack the +11 Shelly May have through that you guys couldn‚Äôt kill the Shelly, and rather than possibly taking 3rd place, he wanted to kill you so he would get second.

---
brawl ball my guy 
---
I know it‚Äôs really annoying especially when your under trophies 
---
Response hit 18.4k last season
---
A lot of you guys are saying that Darryl just requires more skill but if you look at the character based leaderboards he is consistently one of the lowest trophy amounts reached and that‚Äôs with the people who are the best at this game. For average players, especially if they don‚Äôt have his star power, Darryl is incredibly lackluster. Mortis on the other hand is probably ok for now.
