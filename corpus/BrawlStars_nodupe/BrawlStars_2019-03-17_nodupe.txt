#YOURE RIGHT I THINK THATS IT

If the language has the same Roman alphabet like English, it‚Äôs probably keep the original names. There are languages like Japanese, Russian, Korean, or Chinese that have different alphabetical systems. Brawler names will be written in that alphabet but generally it will still be pronounced the same or similarly to the English original.

Are you stupid? You are not a fucking robot who knows everything, you are a human who cannot perfectly tell the range of the turret (especially where the range is not written anywhere!). It would obviously make her a little bit stronger, there is no question.

Why is Pam looking at me like that?

Same thing happened to me. Lost with 1%

Yeah, she's really good, but the bull strat  is really solid tho, I found it to be the easiest to push cause you don't have to rely on your teammates controlling the other teams tank and worry less about precision.

In Vietnamese, all of them stay the same except Crow and Gene which are directly translated to Vietnamese (Crow - Qu·∫° and Gene - Th·∫ßn ƒê√®n).

I mean also bad aim on their part...

They even both have the same idle animations lol

Go to the the bottom of the brawler page and click him

Drop rates in this game are a joke
---
Still, you have to be careful. The higher rank you are, Bull becomes less superior to Shelly and specific brawlers, like Primo or Pam. Pro players who play Bull often be extremely cautious around the brawlers that can counter him. :)))

This is so calming and I don't know why

I got the level 35 pack, got spike and Pam, saving gems for when Carl comes out. Lvl 35 pack is really good in my opinion, but depends on your cash total

Crow is overall a "average" brawler IMO. Problem is his counterparts (spike and Leon) are either universally better or literally braindead bullshit OP. Getting crow is like winning the lottery, but for $20 rather than 20 million. Hence why I think he needs a buff to be as good as spike/leon so you don't feel like hanging yourself after pulling him 
---
air dry clay, thanks!!!
---
I like the skin but it is a kids game so I don't think they would allow it 
---
But to be honest, her super recharges so fast that it‚Äôs almost like a basic attack. I just want her recharge reduced.

If she can have enough range to hit her attacks. I mean yes her super is completely unfair in brawl ball because you need to get close to shelly to score a goal but everywhere else, she cant reach her target to save her life

I do, it‚Äôs just that I don‚Äôt live near them, I live further away from them, but I can call them and play duos and other game modes.
---
Amazing definite upvote hope it gets in game ! 
---
Plus your most likely lying about what brawlers your good with. Get good, teamer
---
#$
---
So someone correct me if I‚Äôm wrong but I think it works like this: your ‚Äúluck stat‚Äù goes up each time you open a box affecting chances for a legendary (you can check in store) and another way is if you get all of the super rare brawlers for example, you technically have a higher chance of getting any other type of brawler. Hope this helped!

I never said that levels had anything to do with matchmaking. I'm saying that they can really help win or lose a match.
---
And I get that they may have been friends, but that is still pretty unfair for the lower trophy person. It should average out so it is more fair
---
Swap Leon for Crow and I'm the same. I bought Leon from the shop a month or so ago. Carl is gonna a Super Rare, so hopefully should get him much easier than the others.
---
I like to call this map either -432 invasion or bull invasion

TFW a crow chases you down and denies you healing, so you end up 10th. But as he picks up your cubes, he gets rekt and gets 9th

Then why do you keep mentioning them? They aren't related to matchmaking, the topic of your crying post

No, it is just how the game works. Get over it.
---
In theory, but watch you get everybody before Carl
---
Nice! Try for 6969 next
---
How could you call that lucky?
---
Sucks... But you will eventually get one. All my friends (who play less and started after) have all 3, so you are bound to get some eventually
---
Thanks maybe I‚Äôll get another brawler or 2 to help me in the quest to the magical number.
---
If you bought something, it will help with getting your account back as you have proof of being the purchaser/account holder via payment transactions(Google Play/iOS statements or even bank/CC statements). Try contacting them ASAP before the person currently on your account starts plummeting your Trophies.

Am at 8k with 18 brawlers...1 mythic no legendaries.... yet months of box opening gave me shit...

#LET'S GET SCRAPPY
---
Viking bull
---
I'm mentioning it because levels can play a crucial part in winning or losing a match. If you are level 2 going against a level 7, that's pretty unfair. Matchmaking should make it fair for all players, not make it onesided
---
Yes, I understand how that works, I just don't like how it works. This matchmaking thing has been a problem throughout the entire community, and I'm singled out for no reason. It can be changed to be more fair. If you are playing with friends that are way higher trophies, it should find out an evened out pool. If [Player Example 1] was at 350 brawler trophies and [Player Example 2] who is friends with [Player Example 1] and is only at 150 trophies, it should look for pools in ~250 brawler trophy range so that it is a little tough for [PE2] but easier for [PE1], so it evens out and becomes more of a fair match. If it is going to be an unfair round, it is going to result in the game losing it's enjoyment value, which should be prioritized so people will want to continue playing. Would you want to continue playing a game where you had no chance and it was unfair?

&gt;This is a good idea but unless this game like blows up like 500M players there won‚Äôt be enough people at every trophy range to do this (at this time they‚Äôre 150M players but I still like the idea)
---
Exactly. If they don't have enough players, they might make matchmaking worse to get matches or severely slow down matchmaking time. They don't really even have 150M players either because those are downloads, not everyone will still be playing the game at this time.

Thank you and glad that you liked it !üòÅ
---
Weak brawler. Very few actually have star powers anyways 
---
This sucks. Cuz I would get something for helping otherwise.
---
I see you are playing the coolest brawler in the gameüëç
---
This is true. Crow has no best stat. He‚Äôs the weakest legendary by far. The weakest assasin by far. Everyone raves about his movement speed. But star leopn and star colt blow his doors off. Mortis can catch him easily. He can‚Äôt outrun most shots when he is in range to hit his own shot unless they‚Äôre shot gunners. Really he needs some sort of adjust. I‚Äôm not saying you can‚Äôt win on him. It‚Äôs just significantly more difficult then any other brawler in his classification. Not to mention 392 damage per feather and only 90 some damage per tick of poison. Wow. At max range crow does less then 800 damage.
---
Yeah not playing them that much
---
Mecha bull too much awesome skin  i love it

How? You got dyna and bo and btw save boxes
---
I found this person too I tweeted bs and you tubers 
---
Is this a 3d model? Or just an image 
---
Didn't even know it was there.
---
 Free from the pet meta in big game
---
Attempting to use special but using the regular shot instead
---
*Wam bam here comes Pam*
---
i will never get any mythics or legendaries
---
Awesome. 
---
EYE CANDYüòçüòç
---
Even epics don‚Äôt lower your probability of leggy... Only Mythics do!
---
How many brawlers you at? Some of my friends are at 7000 without a single legend
---
r/woooosh
---
Will there be a family theme like Penny and Jessie since they are similar with turrets
---
Exactly... ü§´
---
Looks pretty much like the original one
---
That is incorrect. What if you allready have every Brawler and u want to unlock Carl? Then there wont be a "6" maybe a "2"... :) 
---
Who is piper?
---
she
---
13
---
r/engrish
---
I agree
---
ÂæàÈÖ∑ÔºÅ
---
Just normal boxes or big boxes too
---
It's funny because I play since the global launch ad I only miss spike and crow
---
Amo brawl stars come gioco (ho 4001 coppe), mi va bene perdere e vincere ma non sopporto che dei miei amici con 1500 coppe hanno 2 brawler mitici e un leggendario senza neanche avere barrly mentre io ho solo tara.
---
Vorrei sapere la probabilita di trovare un brawler? 
---
(Ho gia letto le probabilita dal gioco)
---
Grazie!üòò
---
Chicken Crow
---
More damage and more HP and faster super charging 
---
The piper one thats going to drop someday
---
Crow is a god in this map, if u have him do play. Also bo and Pam are pretty good. Stay in the middle though
---
I didn't lol
---
Dude matchmaking is based on brawler trophies
---
Nope, I have 11,5k trophies
---
Lower box hp by 6
---
Then Gene‚Äôs super might be too op. 
---
I too but I miss Tara, Gene, Leon, Spike, Crow and Carl:-(((
---
Yeah do it its nice
---
Modern problems, require modern solutions
---
Nice gem count.
---
this game does not exist without cavern churn, never gonna disappear

ATM Rico

Missed opportunity

The IDEA OF THE MONTHüëèüëèü•≥
---
Tara, cus she doesnt wmeven has a remodel or a voice actor
---
I find It not so good 
---
Yes 
---
first of all this skin is one of the best skins because of the animations and it was for 150 gems when it came but they gave us a special offer for some time and now the time for the offer has ended and its again for 150 gems now.
---
r/lootstars
---
You can search clubs but not players :|
---
tbh me neither
---
Thanks üòä
---
It'll be too funny if gene can grab boxes
---
The insane gem thing was a glitch
---
Mine is at 501 right now and overall +8700. But I still matchmaking with people with an overall under 4000, but the brawl is usually around 500. 
---
Its tooo grate idea and nice
---
üòÜ
---
Have you ever been targetted by meteor for 5 times straight? I guess not.

That was freaking amazing. Love yr skills...nice moving.

Thank you üëç

Probs the new brawler is gonna be green ?üòÜüßê
---
Probably bathub carl
---
Lmao tru
---
If this becomes a brawler, I'm not playing anymore.
---
Add some colors!!
---
A new rare brawler maybe
---
I hate Pam &gt;:(
---
That is the joke
---
True
---
Why does this even exists
---
3rd attack do slowness to enemyes maybe
---
Wtf is wrong with these people
---
I lost 7 rounds in a row with the same random teammate
---
Really wish bs can ban these imbeciles 
---
I hate when they removed showdown from 4th game mode slot 
---
I‚Äôm gonna push my bull and Shelly and Rico tomorrow. I‚Äôm excited. 
---
Everyone thinks that play like a pro.. If Supercell has to fix every problem of yours, stop playing it.. noob.
---
Unlimited healing!!!! 
---
An app called brawl stats
---
Thank you very much! I picked up digital art a couple of weeks back. I figured brawlstars figures were a could place to start understanding lol
---
I literally just played against gene in bounty, my friend was jessie and I was next to her turret, gene missed me and pulled Jessie's turret instead! I was dying laughing lmao
---
It‚Äôs a crime to make me choose only one!
---
In gem grab place the mines over the gem's spawn (mine)
---
Is a really useful trick
---
no, they kill the one that gets damaged
---
Yep
---
As a r/spikegang mod, in the name of all my fellow partners, we shall see no aid on that petition.

Man,  you have sum great patience.  Like, just  3 words and 1.5 wating while smb can write an essay of complaint bout not getting legendaries on 4k

This. I feel like every time I play this map, the meteors follow me and only me. Meteor falls, I dodge and move to the right, meteor lands to my right, I go back left and guess what? Meteor falls there too. It's straight up obvious the meteors are not random but literally aim directly for you. Well not really you. Mostly me üòÇ
---
I would only buy this for 1 gem as a joke. 
---
Before in the color of the names mine was red, but since the last update it is now orange.
---
Could you change it to red or let the name change again?
---
You can for mortis
---
What will plant sound like tho
---
Happen to me evertime. Quite annoying.
---
Hmm
---
we need a Bo skin and a piper skin
---
Dew it
---
Do you like the idea
---
I don‚Äôt understand the true reason for why players try to get easy trophies. Yes, you gain faster, but it isn‚Äôt going to work forever. Trophies vaguely represent how good you are, and if you have got a lot of them and have done little to no work to get them, you are gonna be trash - especially when you are forced to play properly.
---
400 trophies for the brawler you used it battle
---
I should say "flash" shouldn't I
---
In rank 1-5 getting 9th place gets u a trophy
---
Leon x Nita indeed
---
Btw I deleted that comment.  The name is no longer showing up
---
Sounds like a sex toy
---
I think it‚Äôs funny
---
the brawler that you are playing should be 400               ((you played with dynamike so mike should be 400 so you can see the replay))
---
Jessie users unite to approve of this
---
The current sounds name sounds like a sex toy or something
---
just a dream to me
---
Cyborg Bull
---
Imagine this map came out first of all
---
Nice name lol
---
Not really because after they update this, everytime people see a barrel they'd shoot it, and Darryl couldn't even do anything for 15 second, Darryl will die
---
Would be better if you can search up the specific player with thier game tag. Still a cool concept tho 
---
Yeah, I like Colt's model tho
---
Wait, is it gone?
---
It's a biutiful game
---
thats very creative and amazing idea man
---
Eh it's okay. I just woke up so I am a bit groggy, probably why I didn't get what you meant.
---
Damn so much work and supercell won't notice this map.  I wish I could play it.  
---
I have 3100 trofeos And i only have 12 brawlers my userne is Alvariguana i want brawlers

Hay noob they created this community for this type of things. We are the community so we should try to make it batter by notifying them about our probs. Lol u noob.

Wait that's illegal

I got my first legendary on about 7000 trophies but got crow on my second account today at 3800...

Skin idea : Bunny Brock for easter
---
I don't care for this at all. I've been playing supercell games for a long time and I've never cared to want this. Beside adding a flag to your base in COC, I don't think this is a good idea. If you want to know where your clan mates are, start a conversation in chat. What other info should we give away next?
---
I am seeing a lot of people talking about club wars, my idea was a 5vs5 Showdown Matches with everyone having 3 Games, maybe you could also choose the teams?
---
Also when will 3vs3 Showdown be added, because we currently have 3 of each brawler type and it would be cool to go on trios, like 3 mythics or 3 legendaries. I know that once you add Carl it won't be the same but it's just an idea. 
---
Trixie's hat should be banned for teaming
---
Hahahahhahaaha
---
And I got him on my second account at 3800... brawl stars is unfair. Have fun with that pidgeonüëç
---
You are not the only one. My movement joystick likes to move around as well.

Don't talk a lie.

Showdown is ruining brawl stars, not bull
---
Don't mess with my crew

I want Brawl stars VR
---
Mine is 14. But you can push really hard with Pam. Piper is OP in bounty and Frank crushes through brawl ball. I am saying that because my brother just don't have Spike and crow. He is a noob so much that I help him getting higher. So I have used these epics and mythics. That's why I said they are easy to push.
---
I think that was kinda obvious.no one would buy gene for 5099 gems lol
---
Since Carl is being released midnight Saturday the 23rd. Thinking the update will come before then sometime, probably Thursday or Friday.

It's hard to draw the line between what is a big deal a which isn't. I did not say/ask something like that, what I'm asking for is clear and explained down in the post. You shouldn't extend what I'm saying in the post to other vaguely correlate (unexpressed) thoughts, because that is a *your* personal extension.

In my opinion, asking for a common box more every day with the current game mechanics would be too much and unmotivated

How do we beta players feel? Were pros and we know how to ckeck bushes lol the thing thats op with shelly is her super. Shes still one the worst brawlers in game tho...

Because that‚Äôs a human.

Well in that case... i dont wanna show proof

It‚Äôs known that shelly does tons of dmg and recharge quickly ult in close range. If you guys deny it, it doesn‚Äôt change the fact.

yeah, if i would knew he‚Äôs like This i wouldn‚Äôt too, but as i already started..

Hi love the game. excellent work with the game. I would like to know if you can tell me what is the easiest way to get a brawler. In a normal box,big box,mega box
---
@u/zFlxless
---
siege has pushed me 1000+ trophies 
---
I can attest to Brock being **good** in boss fight. Actually, Brock's good in the early stages, but once you get to insane, he can't do much. If aimed where the boss is moving, there is a high possibility that Brock will hit all his rockets, dealing over 6k damage. Some combos that would help Brock are knockback brawlers(Darryl, Shelly, Primo, Bull, etcetera), close range brawlers, and stun/slow characters(Frank, Spike, Shelly).
---
I do not have star powers, but I beat insane using Brock, with my teammates being Frank and Pam(No one here had star power)
---
Shelly is ok i mean..tara maybe tapped on a wrong gamemode lol....jk
---
Just use Pam
---
11.4k
---
BUT WAIT. What if the 2 teammates use throwers.
---
The only way to erase teaming is for the community playing brawl stars to decide not to do it.  Currently the majority of the community either agrees with teaming or teams even though they disagree with it.  Until there is a change in this there will be no change. Super Cell doesn't want to ban people and doesn't have an issue with 2 or 3 people teaming up to increase their odds of winning.  They have said they don't like the mass teaming where you have like 8 people against 2 but haven't come up with a good solution to this.  Ultimately the community created the problem.  The community continues to support the problem and it will be up to the community to either correct the problem or go on with the problem.  
---
hello
---
If I know my brawler will win the 1v1, I'm blast their spinning ass in the face. If I can't, I'll spin and blast their ass in the face the moment their vulnerable.

This is in insane 3. They are likely a team judging by their name so idk how they won against insane 2 with those brawlers.

Internet Explorer CONFIRMED

Holy cow!
---
I wanted to be optimistic and not come to this conclusion but I‚Äôm afraid I have to admit you are right. 
---
The fact that respawn times are so short also makes killing anyone with tara or crow really unrewarding
---
EW
---
I took 10 seconds to realise the difference
---
Darn. I played since day 1 of IOS beta (low HP vertical days) and I am missing so many brawlers (mostly new ones)
---
Awesome artwork!
---
What do you mean "finish the damage"?
---
There has been Carl tips for a while now.  Ever since they said he was coming but didn't give a date.
---
Might actually work!
---
You notice it at first, then you dont because youre too busy getting your ass handed to you while being the only brawler left
---
Really?
---
That's true and also the reason why I don't team (anymore). Personally I also don't mind 2 people having an "armistice" to take out another player but that's another thing.
---
Yeah its so unfair
---
Username checks out

Yes man

Me too! I just made a post about it on my profile :))) go upvote it!!

Yeah so u dont get salty when u play randoms and they play shit??

Maybe that's why they changed it. Gosh, it's almost as if Gene is a support brawler.

Thats such awesome
---
What do you mean by ‚Äúthird‚Äù attack
---
Are you saying his poison should stack, but with different effects each time?
---
1 stack = poison damage
---
2 stacks = ?
---
3 stacks = slow

This is one of those OP concepts that will have ro be added on it‚Äôs own

arcade shelly and ninja car tara 
---
A best stat does not determine the goodness of a brawler, there are plenty of brawlers with no best stat. He is the most difficult legendary to master, but being less good than two of the best brawlers in the game does not make him terrible. Mortis will only get close enough to kill you if you let him. I don't think he needs to be adjusted just so everyone can play him easily. He may not be the most effective assassin but he makes up for that in control potential. Poco's damage isn't great either but his abilities make up for it. Every brawler has weaknesses. Just because crow lacks damage and health, does not mean he needs a buff.
---
I mean its already a massive cc, with long range, can go through walls, and with minimum teamwork a solid death sentence to just about everyone. I don't think the 1/1000000 times the one tick of healing saves a life is worth the change.
---
Yeah that would be cool. And happy birthday
---
Lol I was scrolling down to comment exactly this. *Have my upvote instead*
---
First of all, I have crow to 500 at pl 7. So I do know something. And whag I mean by run away is spend 30 seconds getting someone low enough to get pushed, then finish the kill with the other dude then run away. If you get pushed, your dead as crow.
---
Leech Life &gt; Meteors
---
If u can contact the help and support team and give the # of that guy and share the video he will most likely get banned,i hope this helps.
---
Punish then supercell üòÇ ban then or send then to the ranch! 
---
Actualy gene's super is breaking obstacels by brawlers so shouldn't it be painfull enough to deal 400-500 dmg per broken obstacle by brawler ?

True. But I still personally think Life Leech is better than meteors. Meteors is such a stupid mode

Really nice!! It seems like Fortnite Lobby

Man your the best 2D Artist I've ever seen love from india
---
Mortis can at least serve the purpose of survival when both teammates are dead. Poco and Tara can‚Äôt run away well and both tickle the boss
---
Was a really great idea of them to tell people in their AMA that teaming is allowed. I really hate playing showdown since then although it was my favorite mode to play.
---
Now I know when to shot my Shelly super
---
And in that map I played 3 times I think already 0 boxes spawned near me (circle thing on corners) 
---
Would kinda be overpowered tbh
---
That was worded weirdly. If crow gets pushed, he has speed. If crow pushes someone, he can easily control an area. Not every brawler is great at getting quick kills.
---
It probably won't happen much at 3k. But your overall trophies aren't the reason, it's your individual brawler trophies. So if you have some one above rank 16, you'll probably see it, with it being more common the closer you get to rank 20.

He got a buff the slower pull time makes it easier for your team mates to hit the person while they‚Äôre being grabbed

What I‚Äôm trying to say is, crow doesn‚Äôt fit into his description. He should be ‚Äútoxic support‚Äù if they‚Äôre going to label him as an assasin, then a legendary assasin, he should at least be better than the non legendary assassins. And crows star power is absolute shit. 10% damage reduction oh boy Shelly‚Äôs shot went from 2500 to 2250... real game changer. They could easily make crowd star power to be was he tick of poison inflicted heals crow. Many brawlers have a healing aspect. Even Mortis has 2 heals as an assasin. I‚Äôm not asking for to to break crow and add just it so his shot does 2000 damage and 12 ticks of poison. I understand his entire playability relies on kiting. And I‚Äôm fine with that. I‚Äôve played league of legends, I get it. But he should either be labeled as a support, or adjusted to be an assasin. Think outside of brawlstars. Every assasin in any game is a high Dps. They could adjust a small amount to correct

Nobody would want to stop everything you‚Äôre doing to pick an emote. You could pick an emote while Piper is snipping you for example. No offense, but this is a bad idea.

You‚Äôre asking a lot from little kids. Even when I played it for the first time I was confused
---
Dude, get used to it, it‚Äôs hard sometimes cuz sometimes there is a huge amount of people playing the same brawler in the same mode, and eventually there has to be some duplicate brawlers in the same game. You think that‚Äôs bad? How abt 3 max Primos in the same brawl ball game 
---
I don't want new brawlers. Recently I got Leon and Spike (one un normal box and one un mega box) and honestly, I didn't want them at the moment. Why? Because I don't have coins! Right now I have 17 brawlers, where almost everyone has lvl 6-7 and I can enough power points to max them, but no coins.
---
What I have also noticed would be that if I played in a solo queue with a map specific brawler, my team would be with randoms that don‚Äôt choose map specific brawlers or with teams that are hard counters against my team.
---
I don‚Äôt have a problem with that tbh, but at least match me with players that know how to play map specific brawlers lol.

But since he does no damage, he will get forced into another player.

Ok nvm, he's easily the best rapper on Earth.

That‚Äôs a good idea

which one ?

Yeah and if they keep on nerfing him what's the point of putting him as a legendary.

Don't why our friends get legendaries but we don't even get epics. This is where free to play players like us stand. Don't know when and what action the community will take. But we have to make this post famous so that they can solve our problems.

You're right, they should change his description. The star power used to be better when it could stop Mortis from 3hko'n him. They shouldn't buff him just for the sake of making legendaries stronger though. And healing wouldn't make sense for him.

You‚Äôre honestly just an idiot for that and you can miss me with your bullshit of a future.

Imo dynamite looked really really bad. I think the concept is cool and would have merited a very sweet remodel, but the beta actual model looked extremely outdated and didn‚Äôt fit in at all. The colors on the new model also pop very well

I know this post is supposed to be sarcastic but i'll still write down my opinion, if you don't want to read everything, the one that triggers me the most is a) :)
---
A) Sure i find it annoying but i can't really do much about other than start petitions to remove teaming &amp; upvote other petitions.
---
B) Shelly's super should get nerfed a little but i think it's sort of fair too, she isn't the strongest brawler so her super balances her.
---
C) Again, doesn't annoy me, gg to the bull player that managed to get those power cubes.
---
D) It makes sense for supercell not to hire gedi-kod, they're a 2D concept artist and they don't speak english very well. 
---
Very good

Teaming is teaming whether it‚Äôs at the start of a game or at the end. 
---
So you‚Äôre saying teamer is a race?
---
The three of them were grouped together, every brawler with a splash super would have been able to chain their supers in this situation. Its just what happens when you group up to much. Also it was just really satisfying for that shelley which is probably why she spinned.
---
We literally had this map a while ago

Please keep backstabbing because teamers don‚Äôt team because they want to buy feel like they have to in order to get + trophies. If people can see that they don‚Äôt have to team then we‚Äôll see less teaming.

Solo showdown I either get third partied or teamed on or bulls because am a primo main

i just spreading awarenes bruh
---
When a bull/primo/shelly take the cubes they are throwing the game. They are there to tank and draw the attention of the boss away from the real DPS. Sure in theory it sounds good to give the tanks the cubes but since they have to get close and personal with the boss they are healing 50% of the time and wasting their cube. Give it to the pam/colt/jessie and they can get the job done.

I don't know, I think the best choice is Bull with a Bull/Colt/Pam comp... Because with 10+ power cubes he does a lot of damage, has a lot of hp and can escape.

But I think it would also be good as you said.

The problem I'm pointing out is about those who fight against each others and die just to take that power cube first :')

Playing aggressive only suits certain brawlers. The only thing that this would do is force a high health meta, meaning that crow, rico, dynamike, etc. would be terrible. Also, the skill in showdown comes from being able to take down players that have more cubes then you. An alternative solution would be a report system + a hidden aura system that keeps track of how long a player is next to another player without either dealing damage to each other + a system that kept track of vigorous circle spinning. 
---
If this is a repost, give me the original post link.
---
Probably the singular eye
---
Why save boxes for Carl if I still don't have Leon?

Cause u literally can‚Äôt risk going for boxes near the edge cause you‚Äôll get caught by a bull in the bushes right off the start

I despise that map.

Teaming is a result of this bad thought trophie system. And it will never disappear from high trophie ‚Äûranked‚Äú games. I mean why should it. If people can choose between progress and delisting your progress well guess what will they do...

I have made some changes to the post:

 \- Movement speed is based on the amount of ammo, meaning that ammo will have to be conserved and it won't be able to dominate the map as easily
---
 \- Star power has been changed to inflict a burned debuff rather than make him able to move at normal speed while breathing in
---
 \- Range has been changed to be similar to Pam's range
---
Solid tip

My mythic or legendary chance are the same as when i got leon and tara too supercell dosent change much of my luck i end uo wih the same amount

If you don‚Äôt care about using Carl day 1 then yeah you don‚Äôt need to worry. You can just hope for a little luck. But people with 50-100 boxes have a pretty good chance of being able to play him the day he comes out.

Do you think about taking out brawl stars for a videogame console like the nintendo swich?
---
Think it‚Äôs every 30

Island invasion is actually the best map
---
Hi! This is not possible, because spongebob characters can't play brawl stars, only humans or bots can! 
---
Thought it was yours.  Sry didnt see the creator 
---
Pam typically takes them so that she can get close and absolutely shred the boss. Seriously, at some points in pro gameplay I've seen the Pam will have 30 cubes and unload 18000 damage per ammo. She can also keep herself alive while doing so.
---
Yeah my bad lol
---
All 3v3 maps are in 3d which means that they are all bigger horizontally by 4 tiles. 3D players would always have an advantage over 2d players because they can always see the sides of the map

I've played with randoms up to 6k trophies. If you actually want to get good at the game I recommend you try to create a new account and solo queue every hero up to at least 300 trophies. Don't rely on good teammates or friends.

Cavern churn is better than islang invasion i just qin 36 trophies without teaming

Bull destroys Crow, which people use the same term to describe it as they do to describe what happens when you drop the soap.

Which brawler ?
---
That would be cool 
---
This is kinda funny to me, because El primo is considered one of the worst brawlers at high trophy gameplay. He may tank bullets, but his inability to deal deal damage as fast as a shotgunner and his low range makes him outclassed by pretty much any shotgunner. Plus, any decent player can just learn to not easily get close to him.

That makes no sense So what are you supposed to do if you are playing a game mode where you are forced to go near him like gem grab or bounty or brawl ball or showdown 
---
I am 10 too and I am italian, don't worry it is wonderful 
---
Find a good match up against him and play that brawler
---
How do you see them 
---
I don‚Äôt get it
---
You become Japanese and blond(e) while playing Brawl Stars?
---
Oh no, my strategy for Big game is gonna get nerfed.
---
Typically, you want to use brawlers who are good for being the big brawler and the normal five or a brawler you are comfortable using, because the roles is random
---
But they would be weak vs the bots that spawn
---
You shoul've wrote: Dyna saw the yellow gem of teaming, his Eyes flashed, and then he took the gem. Carl was mad about it, But as the power of the gem was high, dynamike used it to Make Carl spin, and agree with the choice. Then They saw a NW mortis, First They were scared, But then Dyna realized that he had the yellow gem of teaming with him. So he used it again. Mortis spun, spun, spun and spun till the death.

I had about 2000 key doublers all at once. Helped a bit. Lol.
---
Better than 18 Gold IMO
---
Wait, that's illegal.
---
Definitely not a repost
---
I hate this picture with all the hatred in my body how is someone lower than 3k got all blrawlers I'm at 7k without 2 of em üò≠üò≠üò≠
---
I think if you manage to use the super grab through a wall/obstacle and break said wall this should cause damage. I would go so far and say each wall/ obstacle  broken should inflict additional damage. This is hard to pull off and should be rewarded. 
---
Yes they are spinning in the middle of the map but it isn‚Äôt teaming smh 
---
Buff Bopoh
---
YES PLEASE. Earlier today I was playing Darryl and a ahelly came up on me. I tried to super out but instead I shot
---
When you realize impact text font memes aren‚Äôt funny
---
I was talking about how the percentage goes down after obtaining a new brawler. 
---
A crow buff?
---
NO!
---
Cause Mortis &gt; Crow therefor mortis skin &gt; crow skin therefor Mortis pack &gt; Crow pack price. QED
---
You gotta ***chill*** buddy
---
imgflip.com
---
Yeah that happens to me too. I'm just stuck on getting my friends to 3 because they're not very high level. When I play with randoms, the Bull or Leon always takes every cube. I had one Bull keep wasting supers just to try to steal some from me.
---
A WEEK IS Just the beginning. The end is where you rage because you don't get him!
---
I think anyone with a brain could counter this idea. Primo is jumping himself into walls, therefore being put there by his own command. When being pulled by Gene, you are being pulled against your will and slamming into walls, therefore I think it should do some amount of damage. However, I think the best idea is still just making so it does 1 damage or somehow explain that it stops healing. 
---
Thats a croatian scumbag, wich im croatian too, and disgusted by him
---
\~\~At least I got power tokens!\~\~ What? I didn't say anything
---
Both of these maps are utter trash. Can Supercell please remove them. 
---
Oh sucks that he's defaming your nationality
---
What a beautiful Map
---
Ok
---
Lul, i have the same case, but i played Poco!
---
dynutmike üò©
---
IMO:This is the worst showdown map as it takes little skill to kill someone.All you need to do is be Shelly or Bull and shotgun someone in the face outside the grass.No where is safe .
---
I'm like gonna piss in my pants now. \*bet 20 tickets on robo rumble and have two barleys on my team.\*
---
Lmao i swear
---
But the concept 8v1 or 9v1 is when you are against 9 or 8. Not that 2 out of the 6 when theirs ways and got killed. 
---
Eh, for better or worse.
---
yes
---
Boi
---
Do you know what is super saian super saian is strongest that normal form that means that im becoming stronger in brawl stars that Real life
---

---

"Buff crow"
---
"hE dOeSn'T nEeD iT"
---
A lot
---
That second panel will never happen :P
---
Crow op in life leach 
---
r/gatekeeping
---
Ikr t wasent too long ago when i got leon or tara
---
Pretty good but i wouldn't call it a 1 v 5 because near the end they were killing each other
---
P.E.K.K.A is a lei, so for this skin could haha
---
until the robot spawns and automatically knows that you were in a bush even if you were hiding not only before it spawned but also out of their range
---
*painful flashbacks *
---
nerf every other brawler so crow can be the best
---
Shelly needs a goddamn nerf. Fuck the buff crow meme, this is a way worse issue. 
---
Somewhere in Facebook fan pages of brawl stars.
---
Maybe retractable hornsü§î
---
I haven't been playing Brawl Stars for very long, about a month
---
Honestly they aren't even skins. They are just art that would never fit in a game. Obviously his earlier one were awesome but recently it's not even skins anymore.
---
Everyone 
---
Why did you go after the el primo? They weren't teaming
---
Super rares are only easy to get if you have the means for acquiring them; that means either gems (to buy the offer) or boxes to open. 
---
Even at 60 boxes, you‚Äôre looking at close to a 50/50 chance of getting him versus not getting him.
---
Serbia Stronk\*
---
And those safe the ones I tilted. I‚Äôm a failure
---
I hope he doesn't become frosty
---
You do
---
Who the fuck picks Poco?
---
Frank is only good in brawl ball 
---
They're called power *cubes*
---
A lot of people 
---
Hello, I have a question about de power ups, the actual green power boxes  give us life and damage, my ask is will you put other kind of power ups like movement speed, attack speed or only life or something else? 
---
Sorry for my bad english i speak spanish.
---
wow cool!
---
No escape you say? 
---
*Laughs in crow*
---
As I Gravity Falls meme, I approve

I‚Äôm aware of those, my point is something else past that. Something that has real people without having to worry about people being online
---
Coonboy
---
I would definitely say point shot 
---
Happened to me to
---
TFW a character with long range is better at close range than a close range brawler
---
So when you rig the dice and make it all 7‚Äôs? Bet.
---
Nice 
---
That's rough
---
5k don't have mortis, Leon, spike, gene
---
Playing 1 year, 5500 trophies. Haven‚Äôt gotten a new brawler is 8 months
---
I think he discounted Poco‚Äôs role, since poco got slaughtered by the team.
---
Seen higher
---
Kinda feel bad for Brock, cuz even though he‚Äôs drawn he didn‚Äôt get to give any suggestions
---
How does shelly stay hired after suggesting level based matchmaking
