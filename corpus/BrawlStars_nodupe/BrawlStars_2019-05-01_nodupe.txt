Its your wifi.
---
Confused.
---
😂 it’s okay
---
I think that you can actually press super, then right afterwards pick up the ball and it will kick it anyway and waste your super
---
Just hope that their is no 'Wanna Team' text lmao
---
maybe people wouldnt compare you 2 gedi kor if u didnt rip off his template
---
Thanks this was just a rough draft after all ;)
---
Nice idea
---
They are being redesigned!
---
Why my pp hard
---
Well then it’s not a cluster f. Because it’s basically 4 people and the other person is basically dead in seconds
---
She is still very good after the nerf.
---
I had a meme that was exactly like this
---
Most I’ve laughed in a minute...thank you
---
This is *ADORABLE!*
---
Yesssss!
---
Second edition comes out! Im too stupid, because i didnt downloaded the image of the first editon. Soooorryyyyyyy. (You: Why did you do that?)
---
I'd almost change his star power to decrease his detection range in bushes down to 2 tiles and eliminate detection at all unless damaged when using super either that or let his super charge a little quicker from Long range
---

How...
---
Get rid of the skulls and it's a good map.
---
There are situations where this arises. Everything's not so cut and dry. I'm just not interested in combing out the little details today.
---
I am semiactive on clash, gets really boring after a while.
---
I don’t think they’ll ever do this people would be extremely toxic towards their random teammates.
---
They should just give mortis an extra ammo slot. They already broke their rules with Carl
---
I would use a Rosa at 500 before the Nerf :)
---
yess that was me
---
gg :)
---
Yep true
---
[removed]
---
that's actually a really balanced brawler idea, more balanced than supercell's new brawlers (XD)
---
Gotta appreciate good randoms every once in a while, gg :)
---
Isn't this a repost but with different phrasing?
---
\*Gets silver*
---
Isn’t that the use of the blue around the edges
---
I don’t lace Leon
---
I saw a similar post before that made me realise  that when it said 4/6 i could be playing against a team. That post saved my life. Good thing to spread awareness. Feast and famine: the fastest tap in the game.
---
Looks lore like yarn ball
---
All the brawlers will never truly be balanced, brawlers are meant to be good at different maps and game modes, ex: piper is good in eye of the storm but awful in stormy plains, vice versa with bull
---
Honestly I don’t think this would even have any drawbacks. The people with legendaries and low trophies can keep them, but no new players would get that
---
it does

Carl has too much of everything mobility, harass potential, damage potential, life and range. He can attack through walls and has a versatile special... Also he will never stop harassing because infinite ammo and his attacks go through players...
---
Gals
---
He shoots fidget spinners at us
---
Yes
---
Tell me about it ... 10k and still without legendary
---
No stop this will just make teaming in showdown easier.

great art but i think crow is good in skin, we need skin for leon or maybe a legendary skin for spike like phonix crow
---
it is. so pathetic.
---
Siege needs a nene guys

&gt;!You wouldnt get backstabbed if you didnt team!&lt;

Holy shit I think i would've burst out laughing and throw my phone if this happened

I killed many ppl with spike including rosa

i need this, i wasted my super yesterday because of this :(

Didn't kill the bear because he wasn't a peta supporter

People already do that by spinning after they kill you
---
Lol we've given him an alternative vaccine schedule although he does appear to have super powers (like turning on the light, or making the car beep, or destroying the eardrums of anyone nearby when hes upset), unfortunately invisibility is still taking a while. He still hasn't figured out how to stay invisible after he comes out from behind the curtain.
---
Are premades that bad at high level? I mean I'm at 4k and I had to scratch my head to get that one.
---
No, you can dodge his shots if you sikemout the enemy. It is hard to do that though
---
Mettaton EX is Sans confirmed

It was so bad.. game is ruined cos of it

Piper likes puzzle lmao
---
Is this the Ryguy? Jimbo's brother?
---
Congrats mate
---
He never said Supercell said it. He said that Supercell knows it. Completely different things.
---
I think I'm blind now
---
His damage is 1200 the fifth LOWEST in the  game.He is outraged by popular in the meta brawlers like Brock Pam Piper Gene Colt,and the hitboxes of the spikes are less than half a tile.How is that strong,if you pair it with the lowest health in the game and a bad super
---
I just got leon yesterday and trust me, you want crow not him cuz he trash af
---
U know it brother. Don't play siege with randoms. You'll die
---
#She’s too OP to be in the list
---
Sure
---
Joke or not, this is just blatant karma farming
---
Agreed.
---
Gene was already decent enough before his buff.  I had no issues winning games with him with his release stats.  Now he is definitely very strong, mainly because of his super in certain game modes.
---
You're equivalent to a anti-vax parent
---
Same doubt, +1
---
And why is he strong.We already looked at his damage,the fifth lowest in the game,his health is the lowest,has a slow reload speed and his super isn't game changing like Gene,Tara,Frank etc. What makes him good?He might have been strong when auto aim was released because of the Bull,Primo meta,but that is about it.
---
How about just make it so if you're aiming your super and pick up the ball then it doesn't fire it when you release and you have to aim again.
---
Lmao yes indeed
---
My God...
---
They're* not overbuffed, they're* good now.*
---
Whatever happened to education?
---
Oh gosh
---
Mortis is incredibly high skill floor to begin with:
---
What you do against Colt is you dash sideways since he attacks in a straight line.
---
Rico is admittedly a little harder, you need to ensure that there isn’t a wall to your side and you can easily push him back (not as relevant in Bounty, arguably his best game mode)
---
Penny does not deal half of Mortis’s health with one shot. Mortis can tank 5 shots from Penny while Penny dies on the 4th hit from Mortis.
---
Mortis can dash out of the range of Barley’s bottles, and you can use that to close the distance between you and Barley. You have to not be so predictable that Barley hits you with a led shot.
---
Piper’s shot is very narrow and you can easily dodge her shots with a dash. You reload faster than Piper, so as long as you dodge carefully, you win 90% of the time against a Piper.
---
Saying that Mortis would lose if there are other brawlers around is irrelevant. Of course Mortis can’t win a 2v1 (except in very particular circumstances). No brawler in the game can consistently win a 2v1 (except Rosa and maybe Leon with Super).
---
Carl and Crow are extremely strong in the current meta, and probably will require a slight nerf in the future. Of course they do Mortis’s job better because they are too strong, Mortis right now is a high skill cap brawler that NEEDS you to be good at dodging and recognizing which match-ups you can win to play him.
---
I want to open your *BOXES*😅😅😅
---
I remember having 3 Jessie turrets. It could work but they should make the decay rates faster. But in doing so, I think Jessie star power would be meh.
---
Thank you I hate this
---
I’m at 67 and counting, going for 100 😁 💰
---
U grinded alot
---
your first mistake was not covering the entire meme with a watermark
---
Tara is clearly the best
---
Gene is my favourite character, and I have Carl and him at 500, so I don’t know what your doing wrong
---
Just a 100... this hoe better hope you get them back, for her sake

It is 2.67, you can just tell by looking at the picture in the post
---
Nobody:
---
Close range brawlers: 1v1 me bitch at the house
---
Rosa is not even there because she is to good for a tier list
---
If they reduce the mine carts it would be more fun.
---
Just mute if if it makes u mad it's not that hard
---
They should make a wanna team button but when someone presses it they get instantly banned
---
You had us in the first half not gonna lie
---
I’ve played both since beta (also clash of clans), and I prefer brawl stars by so much more. Guess it’s just preference
---
Carl: am i a joke to you
---
He did more damage because he is hitler. Hurler did a lot of damage
---
Thats a nice idea
---
#Frank
---
Oh good god xd
---
Good enuf
---
He needs his super range to be nerfed imo.
---
OMG YES! LOVE IT ❤️
---
You can still find the fun at 300\~500+ level
---
I dont play solo after 300
---
This is supercell's game not "EA"
---
Wow that design is hilarious also she reminds me of sonic cuz of her hair
---
Nah it's fine, most of the genes iv seen have aim as good as a guy helecopptering a Glock using the trigger gaurd
---
*takes the power cube from the enemy and heals*
---
I'm actually a huge Mortis fan as well. Perfectly balanced, as all things should be.
---
Okay... Okay... But you'll get trapped on the side of the wall without any reason wasting 1 attack xd... His 9 ability is too situational and while inventivices his playstyle the playstile by itself leaves your team with one character less. Daryll can do almost every thing a Mortis can do if not more because of the time recharge. And the pace at which his ability recharges while being usefull all the time.
---
That's what I said you have to be extremely good on mortis just to be usefull without getting destroyed and the learning curve isn't rewarding as his playstyle is weak... He depends on dodges an hoping that the enemy doesn't delete your teammates while yours give you an opportunity to strike. The difference between him and other characters is that he doesn't represent a big enough threat to be actually usefull if an enemy isn't low. Which any of the other characters mentioned can do better than mortis. His ability would be good if it had longer range or was more spammeable as it would allow him to move greater distances without hindering so much the only thing he should actually do good.  The 9nth ability makes him better at his job but it doesn't matter if he can't accomplish it. Much more in this current meta. But he's just not fast enough. Nor he has enough damage to compensate for the lack of speed. I just think he needs one of the ones above not both. Also auto aim makes fights as mortis much more harder than what they should be as they trivialize your dodge with characters who only have one shot as they don't even have to aim. 
---
But right now there's no reason to play mortis other than I like this character. He struggles to  even kill characters that are low because of the recharge and the range + the single damage attack, gets trivialized by shotguns, melee characters, and some snipers, has a hard difficulty, and represents no instant threat to most characters. His playstyle leaves your team at a disadvantage and is expecting for your enemies to make a mistake.  He can be used yes... Can he be usefull, yes in the hands of a veteran of that character. There's a moment where I would choose him instead of any character if searching for effectivity? Nope. 
---
It's not that he's unfun to play nor bad is just that he needs more. 
---
I just want to know do you really thing he is alright? Needing 5 attacks at leadt for half the enemies in the game. Being countered by half the roaster. Useless in some modes. And having such a learning curve?
---
same
---
f
---
Yeah
---
Very solid idea! It's original too!
---
yep very much while playing rosa!
---
nice but crow already has 2 skins
---
would be better if people focus on brawlers that have no skins
---
I tried this 1029910 times . But there is no answer to help me . Only automatic and i bored.

nice but penny already has 2 skins

Umm, Can someone call Carl? His cart is on the loose.

Don’t say his name in vain!

Someone ELSE already made this post, WITH a timer bar for Frank AS WELL. I just pointed that guy's name out, his name is /u/maltane .

So do we need nore mods?

I’d like to see general texts and then some special texts just for that brawler

Yare Yare...

I found a fun again when I stopped carrying about the trophies...  Try it with just one brawler and see how it goes...

How much do you have? :)

Very Bad edit
---
For the heist map, Just use Piper and git gud.
---
I preffer to use my worst brawler so I dont care about losing trophies
---
Colt×Piper? Nah. More like Colt×Shelly and Piper×Rico(idk why everyone says that, I don't agree) or Piper×Brock
---
Jessie×Crow? FBI OPEN UP ryoryo_su DON'T RESIST. EVERYTHING YOU SAY CAN BE USED AGAINST YOU

So cute 😄😄😄

A very nice and balanced map.. just one thing.. placement of boxes could be better

Kiting works when you have the longer range. Rosa has longer range than El Primo. Your argument is invalid, and Rosa is broken.

yes in my opinion this is the real problem: she can chain super and that's too OP

But you still kill her with instant 23334 damage

Why is this so funny

New brawler? 👀

well, giving the fact that she have 6000 and a 80% shield (equivalent to 30k HP) yes she has too much dps if you see what i mean

You should see Super Cats

No ideea
---
Keeping the distance from shelly isnt possible, if youre playing melee brawlers, her chip damage cancels your heal so you cant approach or run away from her, my last 30 games were including shelly and shes the reason why im losing trophies when trying to push melee brawlers
---
So you’re saying their still not using 100% of the brain or something?
---
Yeah. I have 1 under rank 10 (gene). The rest is around rank 12/13, and i have 6 around rank 15

BUFF LEON xD   
---
it is true.. he's bad now.. need to run away try to charge your super to be able to sneak up to kill someone. the reload speed is slow. you somehow get someone to \~200 HP and he just escapes or kills you.. 'cause you're out of ammo... 
---
I agree give me Spike .. and i'll give you my Leon (if it could go like that)
---
All she needs is a nerf to her ability to chain supers, that's it.
---
How dare you curse me
---
Reposts, reposts everywhere
---
I think it's unnecessary, because you can leave and join another match in less than 2 seconds.
---
btw buff mortis

He's literally darryl

Great artwork, not sure if it’s suitable for some people tho.

Sharp shooters would be OP on this map
---
Because he can roll over the water instead of using the jump pad? How does that make him op?
---
Yep
---
Am I the only one who was excited to have gem carts at first but now want 'em out of the game ASAP?
---
Leon: This...does put a smile on my face
---
Let's see.
---
- Fastest brawler (or second fastest after crow)
---
-insane damage at short distance
---
- one of the highest ranged (even more than colt)
---
- can become invisible and wreck half of the brawlers or any damaged brawler
---
Funny thing I don't see any Leon under 400 trophies, they are all above. Makes you wonder why.
---
Also more exciting without the spinning animation imo
---
During the raid?
---
Yeah but tara is more important because she was in the game for 1.5 year and she has nothing
---
&gt;Tip of the lollipop is ~~leon~~ Rosa and the stick is all the other brawlers.
---
I just unlocked gene. How do I use him?
---
Sory for Polish language
---
Dont forget that also the birthaday of aur only sup-rare girl
---
So before the patch it was at 80%, meaning the turret in siege did 200 damage instead of 1000. Everyone else in the entire game will take 1000 damage a second for being in the turrets range. So even if she takes 800 damage a second, it’s still a significant advantage
---
Carl is a robot...
---
*Let's settle this beef*
---
As a Nita main I’m okay with it
---
Yeah I have him and use his super he even breaks through walls
---
Also Darryl
---
And ugly
---
But her super should be special a 20% block doesn’t so much
---
I can't explain how much is this beatifull
---
Darryl used his super he rolled away....
---
Sorry, I want to apologize if someone thinks that they had the idea first, I think that it’s probably not an idea that any one person can claim, and I thought by drawing it out then people could see what it would look like
---
**CHECK HIS OTHER POST ON IT THEN YOU WILL FIND OUT!**
---
Proof that Leon is Jesus
---
Nuclear waste Darryl
---
I think this is not how this meme is used
---
Alright, good point. But if she took 30/40% less damage for the duration of Leon’s super, would that not be fairer?
---
After 19 matches of tilting he did it congrats
---
Tara: best super in game
---
Supercell: we're going to just pretend we didn't see that
---
Of course you can 🤦‍♂️ there is an easy est to get the same brawlers in the same team
---
There’s a Shelly in the third one

Ok take it easy man I was just asking because a lot of young people are trying to make arts like this so I didn’t wanted to be evil
---
If only her super animation was like that it would be dope
---
yes
---
If you can perfectly aim your super horizontally, you'll be stuck bouncing around for most of the match.

It's bridge too far on desert

That's a bold statement.
---
darryl would only hit one shell because of his horrible spread
---
They... they can’t just *scale up their servers.*  There isn’t a magical button labeled “Increase Server Size In Brawl Stars” in Supercell HQ.
---
Could be too, something that also bothers me a lot is her attack passing through targets, as long as this is in her kit she'll be a stronger El primo.
---
I have no legends at 6k now I am 8k still no crow
---
OMG it's a super, it's called super all-over the sub and game.
---
A ton of bushes doesn't make a map good. The launch pads have no real reason to be there and the only cover that exists on this map is simply not enough. Not to mention that there is literally water in front of the goal and there are 1 tile gaps in the middle.
---
It's a nice attempt, but a lot of bushes don't make a map good.
---
I have no right?
---
spreads as ideas are shared
---
He's in a weird spot. With Rosa being introduced its another close range brawler that can take the fight to him. His super feels just long enough when you have the star power, bit without it you're not going far. I do think he could do with a small buff, maybe 10-15% damage increase at the far end of his range. Or a slightly larger super charge rate at max range.
---
Haha Yes
---
I kinda see it, I feel like it’s the big smile and big hands that leans it that way
---
I’m not trying to insult you or anything, but it might be because you can’t win that much which is why you’re still at 3k.
---
Fair enough. I'm more concerned about the shrinking player pool.
---
I'd still prefer a longer waiting time than being paired with a thrower.
---
repost
---
Did they cuss?
---
It's tutorial
---
Ever heard of cloud services like AWS or gcp? Haha didn't think so.
---
I have 5.2 and no legendaries
---
Done &amp; edited.
---
Can you read? Of course they did.
---
Nice idea but I don't see this working, DUO Showdown is even more frustrating than 3v3 game modes at high trophies
---
I’m not sure how that’s meant to not be an insult. I never said that I played more than a couple of games everyday for the big box stars. Also, 2.5 months isn’t that large of a time frame. The people I fight with spike are also full star power/lvl 10 so I doubt they’re that bad.
---
But that is what Tara and frank were in beta  they were op
---
You didn't mention them cussing in your post.
---
Pretend that the shelly has her super  :)
---
Leon skins
---
It is look at your trophy count.
---
She is still op
---
🤔
---
I had Tara brand new a year ago till now I can't max her
---
supercell you dont have to nerf leon again go see this (great ideas)
---
Yeah, when it works it's wonderful, but timing is very tricky as sometimes Tara's super won't pull people from across the carts like Gene's thing does. I managed to pull this off a couple of times and it was really fun..
---
In higher levels shotgunners always camp and so they will be forced to go towards centre and get killed.
---
#-100
---
I think technically the default isn’t a skin
---
They have bigger problems to deal with anyway.  Even if they do, they still have to worry about things like keeping the game balanced and the price of in-game purchases, both of which are things that people may complain about.
---
Holy Crow
---
Ok then. How about 0.001% for 1 gem

Just learn how to use her Super lol, I never found myself in a situation when I thought "I wish I had even more range to stun these poor people and deal massive amounts of damage to them"

A name of a character from a famous book

I would remove the grass on the walls, the enemys would be able to walk right to the other side with out the other team noticing, this map looks like it would create a lot of havoc on the game.

Hahah you are so funny you need gold humorist hahah looool

The character name is from a famous Chinese book

unless you turn off auto caps, then no one suspects you using mobile muahahahaha

Supercell: Let’s nerf his super again to 5 seconds, but get rid of the thing where it reveals where he is if he is close, an already pointless mechanic.

Community: This is freaking ridiculous!!! (Thank you very much! I wish I could post them with templates, but idk how to use photo shop at all and I think it would be easier if someone typed the stuff while I provide the lines)
---
Frank
---
lmao i didn’t get to enjoy her pre-nerf even tho i got her the first night
---
Nice
---
What happened?
---
My club isn’t on rn so I’m curious as hell 
---
I may be loosing my shit but doesn’t the time stop in brawl ball
---
he still has too low hp
---
Happy cake day
---
Its a removed update . Pls no post agin
---
Awesome skin idea!
---
Obviously because if you lose it’s matchmaking’s fault
---
too many bushes for a "sniping map" and those chokepoints would be annoying as hell to pass through
---
there are also 1 tile gaps
---
Great map but 20 players is a lot bro
---
i got spike around 4400 trophies hes the only legendary that i have still and im at 5500 now. I got gene the day before suprisingly. ur string of luck will come
---
Ifaags
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) 
---
( ͡☉ ͜ʖ ͡☉)
---
( ͡◉ ͜ʖ ͡◉)
---
Piper mains rejoice 
---
Bull mains cry
---
That really cleared everything up, thanks
---
🤪🤪🤪🤪
---
What is this
---
Literally unplayable. ^valve, pls fix.
---
El Leonidas
---
Underrated comment
---
Lit up the world
---
That Nita was dope
---
I got 8000 and missing ALL Fucking legendarys and ALL of my friend (with around 2000 trophies lower than me) got one legendary or MORE! TRIGGERED
---
# DOWNVOTE NOW!!! THIS IS A REPOST!!!
---
When a brawler gets a remodel their skins are remodeled too, not changued. The remodeled skins could be different but always have the same thematic.
---
Babies don't fall from sky lol
---
Genes these days... They don't let people let things slide...
---
clearly, who elses fault would it be?
---
We all Need this!
---
Oh yeah yeah, i gotcha
---
It's kinda obvious the reply was a joke
---
Duolincrow
---
r/redditsings
---
And is it correct that you're not speaking english as motherlanguage?
---
Could be, i just put it there bc it was lost space
---
Have yo uever seen her her super
---
Terrible game until they ACTUALLY nerf Rosa, I and my friends have quit until they do. Every single game mode is filled with them and the only  way to escape them is if you do a friendly game.
---
Sorry because bomb looks a bit weird but it was hard to draw it on phone.
---
No :(
---
all people playing the map have to have it downloaded and since it’s a custom lobby it’s client sided anyway I think
---
My pb was 22 seconds
---
how I can select this?
---
Brawl Ball with real life friends. Can be very useful in that mod.
---
Leon's dinosaur scalesuit came in the mail, now he can go to anthrocon
---
"But there WAS a shop offer and I didn't have enough gems"
---
Maybe this meme with the man who looks back to this girl do you know what I mean?
---
how can i use that?
---
Clash stars
---
Hey I have a Leon
---
Cast it into the fire
---
Well not really, I don’t think brawl stars implies it, it’s more of a fan made idea
---
Gotta use thermal paste + heatsinks + fan to keep that phone cool
---
use this on this subreddit r/reddit.com
---
I hope this primo has some real toes underneath them Spartan kicks. Like bro, why does Primo have no toes??
---
It's too messy, it has 1 tile gaps, the spawn locations are too far from eachother, overall just poorly designed but the concept is nice so you should try to improve it
---
What a legend
---
What?
---
I am getting dissapointed every day. First I though Piper was grandma and I saw a pic where I realised she was young that I though that rosa was grandma and now this..
---
I have a J3 and this happens occasionally.
---
It's says UP to 10 times the rewards
---
Great! With 2 brawlers left it would be epic move :)
---
Thanks its only an idea
---
It was a good map. We needed a map without Brock or piper. You could also play Rico or mike on this map to some success
---
Wham bam here comes Pam—-bull
---
no problem. 😄
---
What kind of iphone is it?
---
me*, isn't it?
---
Hahahaha
---
well played lol
---
That map has a bit too much wather on it for brawl ball but it could work for bounty or gem grab
---
That nerf barely did a thing
---
I bought it
---
A man of quality!
---
Hahaha so good
---
Goddamn It Leon Is Fapping In front Of Nita And Nita Says... OhHHhHH yEsSssSSSs!! 💦💦💦
---
*300 damage headshot*
---
In the grass it turns to a pen.
---
Why does he need luck?. I'm not seeing it. Is it because he is playing with randoms? Because if so I only play with randoms so I must be super hot shit.
---
O
---
I think its OK as pink, it fits her well because she is kind of a fortune teller?
---
I play with randoms all the time and nobody congratulates me.
---
A character from League of Legends that gets a new skin every 3 seconds.
---
There are around 140 characters in League but Lux has by far the biggest ammount of high quality skins in the game.
---

---
🌚
---
Poor crow.....
---
Dashing barrel
---
Darryl
---
The hero we need!!
---
Too bad 99 percent of clubs I have ever joined are inactive.
---
It does kind of fit the fortune teller idea but with no voice acting and no other skins, the fact that she has a color that looks very similar to gene makes her feel so bland
---
Goddamn It Leon Calm The Fuck Down
---
Nice map! The bottom side has an advantage over the top side though.
---
+5 trophies for upvote and -10 trophies for downvote.
---
Why thank you
---
That lollipop about to end this man's whole career.
---
u/SRYagus
---
Lol he just gave up after that
---
I really don't see how this map will work in any of the game modes. Either way, it's a nice map
---
bro...
---
The color.... duh!. I'm colorblind and I can even see that all 3 are different.
---
Fail
---
Now thta you mention her colors looks like gene i see...
---
Maybe her color could be changed a bit, i cant imagine how it would look like, but it could be changed.
---
Oh oops
---
Props for the Dynamike and Mortis edit.
---
Download Braw Stats from the app store and it recommend brawlers for certain maps
---
Same
---
i'm sad that no one noticed my darryl lines ideas
---
Ok then please fix the grammar.
---
Ohh thank you! I do have some friends too who contributes some ideas. I'll surely make more of the comic soon!
---
Yeah, they do all take place (at least) in the same universe
---
Yes!
---
Ahhh I hurt
---
True, true... Now the question is why the heck is Mortis keeping his naughty magazines in the morgue.
---
You’ll never shine if you don’t glow
---
Thats Mortis. Not Grne
---
thanks mate
---
Just... You'll see. I can't spoil next comic too much
---
Too bad Carl
---
It's just a spike that Mortis licked
---
have a galaxy j7 prime and this never happens...
---
Haha, I don't color this, do I? It's easier tbh...
---
Yes nobody cares, that’s why you made a whole reddit account to tell them
---
Very soon. I don't really have a fix update schedule, but I try to upload as soon as possible.
---
That and "hi people sorting by new" are infuriating
---
perhaps 3rd times a charm someone will notice my darryl lines
---
Nope. I’ve been doing this on a few posts, do you really care about this post let alone know what this post even is?
---
6.1k
---
SWEET SOUNDS...
---
50% of the time
---
sad Darryl hours
---
That could've just been connection issues, though, right?
---
#HAH
---
Yes, I get all the tokens every day and all the star tokens except for siege. My friend just pulled Leon and Piper out of consecutive boxes today and he now as 24 brawlers at 4k. I'm fine that getting brawlers is completely luck based, but the scales shouldn't be tipped so far in one player's favor and against another's.
---
Exactly. Like, nobody cares please stop karma whoring
---
It means it’s a joke u insolent little kid. U need a fucking dictionary
---
Oh Hi Mark! Also that is the truth.
---
Add some spinning effects for the team section.
---
Possibly but I don’t believe that it is because he knows how to move right after getting supered by shelly
---
I have an iPhone 8 and my battery went from 80% to around 70% after 10 games of showdown.
---
Yea it’s about his tilts, I personally don’t care, but others do and can relate. Just because a post isn’t informational doesn’t mean it’s useless, I could understand if it was something so repetitive like screenshots of all rosas, but afaik this isn’t that common of a post
---
So gud i now have cavities
---
3rd times a charm i have reposted it again
---
.... The account you're talking bout? Lol
---
I have an iPhone 8 and my phone went from 80% to 70% after around 10 matches of showdown.
---
Thank you for the encouraging words. I hope both of us get a new one soon!
---
Make her range slightly smaller or increase the amount of hits she needs to charge her super
---
NW Mortis
---
So if someone posts that they lost 300 trophies, then we upvote them so they get 300 of a different kind of trophies back. Genius
---
Ha, sucker...get it cuz he sucks a lollipop
---
Piper X Ricochet
---
Hopefully they give Tara a skin
---
It was 16 days ago that you last talked to me, and you can’t get a catchphrase right? Seriously go get a life.
---
Haha ur bad
---
Nah, I'd say it's the other way around. Barley's Star Power is better, his area denial potential is better, he is easier to use, he can somewhat defend himself in close range combat...Dynamike cant do these things, Dynamike has damage and can destroy walls, thats pretty much it. And sometimes you dont really want to destroy walls as a thrower since they give you cover but you know...
---
What grades you got?

Wait, that’s illegal

I know how about calling a Beat off! Wait that sounds lewd.

Shes trash now

Nest duty is required for this trail.

Wtf was that colt thinking lol XD
---
The only reason people don't use that hat is because they don't need the power of it to win

Like fr though you don't need that kind of power

Like all things should be yo

*pretty strange*

Who would wil: LwawL SrarS or BrarB StatS

Sorry I like my coffee white, like the clan.
---
I'm deeply sorry if I've single handedly offended everyone.
---
So the other 50% you aimed all yo shots? Still nice with the cast on
---
What's its for?

Ya, I don’t see any difference whatsoever.

All A’s one B now my dad’s gonna beat me
