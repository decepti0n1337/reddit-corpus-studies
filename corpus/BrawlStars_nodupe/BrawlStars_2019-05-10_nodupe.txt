Wasn‚Äôt even teaming. It was more like a sarcastic spin cuz I had my super so knew I had the dub in the bag. Anyone else do that?

He didn't save any power cubes for u when ur ded cos he gave up on u

Of course he plays rosa

Lol my friend opened 79 boxes, 8 big boxes, and a mega box. Got no new brawler, didn‚Äôt get a brawler recently so his odds weren‚Äôt that bad. He saved all of that for Carl and still only got him after a week from the incident.
---
So they should be good either way
---
Did you get star player

I don't understand the legend reference I get noobmaster from endgame and all that is the legend from endgame too? Did I miss something

He was just a troll who mislead the subreddit causing everyone to get in a frenzy. And people are literally still mentioning him as if he was being genuine and not just trolling. Further giving him the attention he wants.

Because he got nerfed after that

No one

Hell no

Wait, that's illegal.

look! here rosa!

Pfft mines a 0.065% chance that's a nice cockslap to the face from supercell

They were teaming and they still all died, smh

Umm...ok

She is so thicc that its impossible for her to squeeze out of that box

Haha! Yeah that's gotta be it

How does that have any thing to do with this

That's true
---
Some apex epic gamers are downvoting... But yeah I agree with you. There's legit no reason to give money for Apex. Battle pass for skins in a 1st person game...
---
Hey that's my skin idea!!!
---
needs more jpeg
---
I marked the minecarts with the red dots.
---
that would be huge ! the amount of time I get stuck on cactus while dashing away and die because I can't escape a shot...
---
This looks great and especially since his super slows down brawlers it can just be ice and would make so much sense
---
Rosa being added to the game made him so much more worse
---
One barley ult and that‚Äôs game

I‚Äôm in a hella trash club but I‚Äôm the pres and it‚Äôs all peeps from my home town so I can‚Äôt leave

This is Our Victory(USSR theme plays)
---
Tbh the skin is absolutely....... TRASH
---
I think that for a buff it would be enough to increase the damage, decrease the releoad speed (2 sec to 1.8 sec?), pass the recharge of the super from 5 to 3 shots and a rework of the star power [example. he could summon a dark shadow (like the tare one) every time he uses his second shot and only goes a little farther than mortis and does 1/4 of the damage (in this way he could control the bushes).
---
Pam: Nita has 90 degree burns after this incident, how about we don't let her be a fire starter.
---
and if he run too he can find a bush camper and dies
---
You should have watermarked this
---
Yeah, with her range and reload speed makes her unbeatable, and that‚Äôs without her super ready to be used. Basically the counter to all close range characters especially Mortis since he has to actually get close to Rosa to kill her.
---
Its shit
---
It's a long way to the top if u wanna rock n' roll!!
---
Would be quite accurate
---
I feel like the ice spirit should be his super cause in clash royals he freezes it would make more sense

dun worry man we will know its ur work, at least us on reddit...but instagram tho...
---
I would buy,even though I don't have Spike
---
I mean, she is dominating most of the game modes I've been in lately. I can see her being nerfed further still and being far from useless. The games just feel like if she ever gets into range of anyone on your team, she almost immediately has her super active, while one shotting that character, and can proceed to steamroll down the line. It's like, "Oh, Rosa caught someone. The next 5-15 seconds we are completely zoned from the entire map, because we can't return kill her and if she touches any of us, we're one shot."
---
It could just be a l2p issue on my part, by I've yet to see any champions that can deal with her on congested/cover filled maps.
---
I can‚Äôt believe supercell balanced primo and bull so well in the meta (especially primo, he was so fun to play) and then they literally just introduced a brawler who could do what both do but better.
---
Crow, Leon and Mortis are assassinss that have exclusive speed
---
i got a spike !!!!!‚Äônnnnn
---
this is a horrible idea i dont want everything to be locked behind a paywall i am a f2p and you are just a pay to win guy and want to spend money this is the most horrible idea so yeah stop doing dumb low effort posts DOWNVOTE

‚ÄòNope‚Äô

Oh. I posted this on Reddit but didn't get much upvotes.

Just some random screen recorder i found in appstore

What is Leon?

Absolutely rare, almost impossible.

Never seen it happen before.  Congrats on being a badass, but I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôve got shitty teammates.

Have you ever seen a Phoenix Crow's Super?

Ice can make u faster if spike uses his super while you run

You spelt *scrappy* wrong.

I brought night bitch Mortis and now I sad

maximum is 24

Yup.

I need this

Spin me right round

That was my post, and I made sure my keyboard was in English. That could be a factor for other ones though.

Thanks. I'm trying to learn how to better promote my maps so that they have a chance of getting in in-game but I'm not quite successful. Any tips on when or where to post?
---
**Flashback to watching a clay animation video about a catgirl being kidnaped by a pig**
---
Yes ITS THE BEST OMG
---
I get your opinion but the point of reddit is to post thing that you or other people like or for brawl stars reddit chat you want to get stuff in the game you want so you do that by reposting things so supercel sees it and his name is above the picture the credit is going to him and isn‚Äôt this just like in first grade when you draw something and the person next to you copies it and there just coping it because they like it
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure if this was coloured it would get the upvotes it deserves
---
why?
---
Dang that would be a sick Poco skin
---
Yessss
---
My f2p brother got him maxed out already. I didn‚Äôt even get Rosa from a box yet lol, but the rest of my brawlers are maxed out and at 500.
---
Lol your going to get so much hate
---
Why ??? I still killed half of them and came third
---
Or Ice Spirit Spike
---
My skin rework idea:ice spirit ontop of his head and shoot icicles and the those extra spikes can be snowflakes.
---
Hate when everyone Targets me but I share same pain.

You shouldn‚Äôt team no matter what it ruins the game

a lot of people mess this up, but "the first" would be El Primero, not El Primo.

He have dynamike and brock

I love this, if this isn‚Äôt a christmas skin I‚Äôm gonna be mad

I think he is a beta player

They were available in boxes before the trophy road

I don't think that it's a big addition. Seems like a minor thing similar to the ability to change name colours.

We just had the update a couple of weeks ago, and Supercell did release Rosa almost immediately after, unlike what they did with Carl. We should ve happy with what we got. The update will come when it comes

Y is mortis at F . He is super OP. Dyna is the one who should go to F.

I spotted 10. 6 are on the sides and 4 of them are near each goalpost.

Actually at this trophies level what brawlers u use doesn‚Äôt matter, gj for getting star players anws.

How could you fail to spot 16 ONE TILE GAPS?

Please stop teaming
---
Did he fly across the field and snap the safe away
---
Its Darryl. You are so stupid. Wish could downvote twice.
---
Home run for bull
---
I pushed my mortis to rank 20 on siege. Siege isn‚Äôt about attacking the Ike, it‚Äôs about control of the middle. Control the middle, you control the game. Mortis, penny, barley was my comp. One game in particular, barley and I completely controlled a bull. Barley gets his health down, I go in for the kill. Bull literally never had his super because we just controlled him. Mortis is so freaking good if you have a good comp and are smart with him. If shelly pumps all 3 shots quickly and misses, she‚Äôs dead. Mortis can kill her. You can kill full health primo‚Äôs with mortis too if you‚Äôre really smart(and frankly, a bit lucky). Frank is easy to kill with mortis. Like insanely easy.

I want Crow cuz i play showdown a lot

Still don‚Äôt understand sorry do you have a tutorial because I don‚Äôt see a big red button on the side bar.

Simply this would slightly increase dps make his long range a little better and charge his super faster how would that be a nerf?
---
I have Leon and Crow is probably better

Nice now make a Tara skin

I contacted. They gave me steps to do, which was to restart the 4g and it didn‚Äôt work. Then they said I lag because of my network, when nothing else lags. Browser, social media, netflix, youtube, all work fine. Even brawl stars menu works very quickly. It only happens when I get in-game. I called my provider and they also say there is nothing wrong with the connection. But supercell still blames on my connections

"El Primo" is a mix between a stereotypical mexican name that fits a wrestler like him and the word "primero" which means "First" in spanish

Hey I kinda agree but can you help me how do I put a brawler at my name just like you?

This is the most boring and ugliest skin ive ever saw.. Lol, disgusting work..

You better be happy that you actually got something useful.

No.......... *double jumps away with max dynamike*

Are you trying to farm down votes or something

You‚Äôre overthinking it. It‚Äôs just them asking what people listen to while playing, has nothing to do with music in the lobby. It would be a nice feature but nothing in that tweet hints at it being added.
---
This is sick
---
Gene is a top 3 brawler right now. He doesn't need a buff at all. Go practice with him more...
---
you havent seen the whole match, those 8 gems ive got them by rushing after rico was just keeping the straight walk for the 11th time in match,
---
i've made a mistake rushing piper while rico on mi side can shoot and didn't did it , but hell, yeah, i was with 8 gems that got by myself
---
Lmaooo

Piper is quite good on this particular siege map.

My friend is a beta player and has all brawlers except the legendaries

He has 2 legendaries, i have 1

I don't really know where is he from

Is this a joke
---
I don‚Äôt think this is true... I‚Äôve only been missing leon and spike for two months and I haven‚Äôt seen a legendary offer since Sakura spike was in the shop. I‚Äôve been waiting for leon forever
---
Theory: spike became a brawler because his biggest dream as a sprout was to be a baseball player, but he couldn‚Äôt stop leaving spikes in the ball on accident, so none of the other kids would play with him, he never made the team during tryouts, and everything was sad. The end.
---
Plus he makes a 180 and says it's a joke even though the first word of his title and his flair both say "Misc"
---
You tell me.
---
i stoped playing this game for like 2 months because i couldn't get any new brawler now i am playing again because of rosa bought her for gems and then i got carl and gene
---
Youtube?

I was referring to Team Fortress 2
---
Yup
---
At full health same power a Brock can kill Leon with 3 shots and can shoot three before Leon can. If keep killing you avoid them stop blaming the creators because Leon has a good mechanics. Invisibility and high Dps is always going to be good. As an assasain he should be able to beat Brock at close range it‚Äôs not Leon‚Äôs fault you‚Äôre bad
