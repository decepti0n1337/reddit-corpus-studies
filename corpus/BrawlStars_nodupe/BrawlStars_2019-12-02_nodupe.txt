---
Downvoted this on two accounts just because I hate it.
---
Ive been on the receiving end of shit matchmaking for a while now n I don't know why. Whenever I play 3v3, especially brawl ball, I end up with a trophy gap of up to 200 trophies with my teammates. Anyone knows why?
---
It's really common
---
The answer is quite straightforward
---

---
Kids are dumb.
---
14.3k 27/30 level 200 (about)
---
That‚Äôs good
---
frick my bad
---
Damn it man autocorrect fucked me I didn't realize it until you said something
---
1.5k people give a fuck.
---
I just got to 11k and the only brawler I need is sandy. I doubt it‚Äôs really common but I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll hear about it on reddit in the rare case it does happen
---
Leon knows
---
Repost
---
to be honest, i used to ignore people and they would kill me, so i just kill people if they get close enough now. if u try to be a nice guy and don‚Äôt kill them, eventually they‚Äôll kill you
---
Very high effort post right there 10/10
---
Leon now will have bandaid
---
Lvl 103 30/30 14.8 k
---
I'm scared now...
---
Yeah!
---
My lil brother knows
---
 no, these are new brawler ideas
---
Ah, yes. This is perfect
---
New brawler ideas
---
If you've gone more than 2 months without a brawler and you've only been getting star powers you'd complain as well
---
Lol thank you :)
---
xD
---
lol he got it he just responded with *oof*
---
Same here
---
Btw, cool drawing :D
---
[removed]
---
Spin to win! (Nice job btw)
---
No, new brawler ideas
---
And still no easy way to report afk or match throwing players. 
---
I'm still in love with the game though.
---
My tag #2GORRRJJ
---
Oh, how will I ever get past this....
---
The one on the right is damn sexy
---
I did somthing like this but yours is better
---
No, those are new brawler ideas...
---
But the girl could be a bibi skin
---
is No top hat mortis  
---
not mortis  
---
no top hat mortis shouldnt exist  
---
only rockabilly can exist without hat
---
Thank you sir!

Lol idc
---
Sorry i dont speak enchanting table
---
Epic! I love it! I love Crow!
---
It be that way
---
lmao ok ill give it to u XD
---
looks good! üëçüèª
---
It‚Äôs crow
---
he let u win tho so ya big brain +2 trophies
---
Yeah this mode is about finding a spot where you can shoot the robot without getting caught in the retardness storm. You can easily get top 3 every time if you focus on shooting the robot.
---
Lol
---
I made a post,check out my profile i hope more people notice your work
---
I refuse it to be anyone else except Tara because of the cards hehe
---
Nice
---
i like to use my rico because he can bounce his shots and stay safe. sometimes i have to take hits  from the close range guys and stuff but i usually make it out okay, should i try using a different brawler?
---
Thanks big brain
---
lol
---
Ur just a god
---
Looks great
---
O that makes so much why so many people chose Tara 
---
Good joke üëç
---
Thank you
---
It‚Äôs Rosa
---
What?
---
got leon, spike snd sandy at 2.5k trophies but still haven‚Äôt got carl, all epics and all mythics lmao
---
Because of the uno cards
---
I know it!!!
---
It‚Äôs shelly
---
nice masked pastel
---
SHREK
---
Not gonna lie some of the molds for these bootleg toys are pretty good like this one so it sucks they have to be bootleg so they can‚Äôt use the correct colors.
---
Nice! Super original too!

How could you miss supercell getting rid of Mortis hat and how we as a community got it back. Top üé©
---
Sandy used Sand attack!
---
Opposing Elctabuzz's accuracy fell
---
Electabuzz used Thunder Fang!
---
But it missed!
---
Sandy's Sandstorm wrecked up a Sandstorm!
---
Elctabuzz was buffeted by the Sand Storm!
---
Sandy used earthquake!

Its super effective!

Opposing Elactabuzz fainted!

The hero we needed, but didn't deserve

It‚Äôs bull, isn‚Äôt it?
---
So is he limited or not
---
I love it too; and now I love your cute little art
---
This needs to be added!
---
I‚Äôve lost one 3v3 this entire season. But the solo and duo modes have absolutely screwed me. I agree with you 100%. They have no place in a so called competitive setting.
---
It's obviously Pam
---
This allows both jump AND landing daggers hit. The commenter clearly said if you land you can hit all daggers, but did not mention the initial jump before the landing.
---
this was stolen and put on a fakey's insta
---
Yes.. this obviously means that all can hit when you take off since taking off and landing are both the same
---
Very good idea
---
i wished crow's poison stacked but it would make him too op wait why am i talking about this sorry extremely irrevelant i just wanted to say something lol
---
What‚Äôs their @
---
INVISIBLE WALL
---
you obv didn‚Äôt pray enough lol
---
The next one will be a mythic. And since you need two of those already and two legendaries... what are you doing! Open those damn boxes man and tell me what you get from them. I bet you'll get at least 2 more brawlers and you'll get to upgrade your low brawlers so you can rank up trophies faster
---
wow
---
man this is cool
---
...I have no idea what's going on!
---
ikr
---
What character?
---
im at 17.5k and im nowhere near "pro". pro refers to people who are actually skilled, have played in tourneys.
---
one way of judging someones skill is by looking at their 3v3 victories , i would call someone with atleast 10k 3v3 victories as pro.
---
Yea I‚Äôm curious too
---
Your post has been removed, make sure to use the body of a post to elaborate on the title.
---
How do you do a vid on this reddit
---
If you haven't noticed, Crow is forced to move a little bit when jumping which makes that impossible unless that proposed change you stated was implemented. Don't say anything unless you know game mechanics.
---
Looks funny to play
---
i guess it just goes to show brawl stars is popular enough to make bootleg toys. even if they are tiny cheap plastic ones, the designs are cute enough that people might buy them not even knowing what they're from.
---
Can be possible in takedown tho, I just want to say that my idea was not serious and that this post was just something I just noticed and thought was interesting
---
those people asking for crow buff don‚Äôt know how to use him
---
Joe mama
---
I only lost 2 3v3 and got demolished in the solo and duo modes when I play a tourney I'm glad I dont see them
---
lol tried that
---
agreed
---
it does get higher
---
Basically the map when it‚Äôs overtime but for the whole match, sounds fun
---
Why? There is nothing to explain.
---
That was my first impression after seeing hundreds of more new comments after my own
---
but why U/ 
---
**HUH?**
---
Bro what did I just watch? Haha

bro üòéüí™

Effort=/= Quality
---
Nice Frank with the green suit. Looks nothing like Leon
---
You can get a legendary with all those points
---
&gt; Bulls and pams are role models of Takedown, they ignore each other and go for boss to win.
---
Where are you getting matched with players like that? The Pams I get matched with prefers killing others,  even when I have just spawned and she's already got like 12 power cubes. :(
---
It's Leon
---
I'm at Malaysia.
---
Prove: Selamat pagi (means good morning)

Yes that was intended

Here is the fact every player with that GX is Italian because GX its a youtuber name and clan so every fucking kid copy it, just to say I'm Italian too but my namE is TOD I'm not retarded enough to put a stupid name on my... BTW grax is the Italian youtuber and every time I see a GX I get mad and kill it
---
God dam right
---
yes, thats what it shows after a game ends.
---
(yes, i saw what really happened)
---
I think that is shelly
---
More prove : Apa (Chinese means" ‰ªÄ‰πà"„ÄÅEnglish means "what")
---
That‚Äôs what the map‚Äôs name should be
---
Senti testa di cazzo va a farti una vita e cresci porco dio GX nel tuo nome ti fa solo sembrare pi√π coglione solo per onorare grax ma fatti furbo
---
He's trolling. Check his post history
---
I did not mention the initial jump because in Siege, landing on the IKE is quite common for Crow users in the mode, and taking off from the turret itself (something that almost no one does) is very impractical since Crow‚Äôs likely to die Extremely Fast and he can‚Äôt charge his super when damaging the IKE, same applies to Heist Safe since enemies respawn very near
---
Me too. Wonder what she s having for Xmas ?
---
Please fucking kys

I‚Äôm pretty sure they didn‚Äôt look up shell shock on he internet to find the 1917 term
---
A kid in a hoodie that throws fidget spinners and has candies?
---
Tara's super is for crowd control. U can aim her super so that it hits not just the bot but other players too to charge super. If using star power, your shadow clone can assist you by attacking the bot or distracting other players(1st star power) or heal yourself if you suffer lots of damage(2nd star power)
---
I‚Äôm Chinese and I think durian is interesting.
---
Do you feel the love?
---
Happy cake day üéÇ
---
You know u just wasted your time supercell is not even gonna put that in the game it's been months but supercell hasn't even add gedikors skin in the game that's why it's a waste of time and energy
---
Supercell has said that they will not release an exclusive brawler at 15k for a long time or probably never, the average player base is somewhere around 5k going by that they already have a hard time unlocking brawlers like Emz.
---
because
---
It's good dude
---
How do people guess anything other than Leon lol. That couldn't more clearly be a hoodie.
---
Leon
---
At really high trophies, you have to get lucky to even make top 6 when going only for the boss
---
Although Frank, Pam, Darryl, Bull, and El Primo with their THICC hitboxes don't get hit for some reason so there is a decent gap between the daggers and him
---
that is probably one of the funniest things i‚Äôve read this week, whether he‚Äôs joking or not lmao
---
Credit for the cutest art is what I think is what they meant?
---
Wonderful community? All I‚Äôve seen is either toxic assholes, or literal 12 year olds.
---
Why not durian spike xD
---
Durians can't roll
---
Boi Durian yey
---
Woah woah woah a legendary is a bit much for 15k, just got there i that's little overboard. Maybe like 3 mega boxes, but we shouldn't rely so much on the trophy road
---
Jezus Christ.You have 104 big boxes

Piper is god in snake prairie

To be honest, I don't really expect that my ideas will get added into the game. You see I just draw for fun, that's all :D
---
Oh and one more thing, I recommend you checking out [this post of mine &lt;3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/c57e4v/thats_real_hot_robo_crow/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)

**It's one my skin suggestion &lt;3**
---
Until you get another brawler you seem maxed on power points
---
ooo
---
yes you can be arabic nowü§£
---
Truly amazing. If I had a platinum to give you would get it, this is a really excellent drawing. Keep it up.
---
are you mad that this game is older than 1 year???? It doesn‚Äôt matter if its beta, alpha or global release, the game itself is 2,5 years old! what part you don‚Äôt understand? with your logic those 1,5 years is a totally different game? how old are dumb are you?
---
U also can't blame them as they could have bad connections

Hello! I'm currently using an LGG4 with Android 6.0 as the latest version, and I believe this is the main cause of the crashes. Is there a possible way on how to fix this problem directly on this device?

I have removed all cache, restarted the device, uninstalled and reinstalled brawl stars.

even jesus himself plays bs

Beware of his roll ouch

Hehe, thanks)

How does that work. I got 70 for my 550+ brawlers and nothing for 525 guys. :(

just went to the game and it didn't even let me move my brawler causing me 3 losses i just wanted to push spike -_-
---
It needs to be like a Kings Box or a Star Box where you are guaranteed to get power points, brawlers, star powers, coins, gems, tickets, token doublers, and even star points!
---
this has 25 times goodies as a regular brawl box!
---
I'm playing for 11 months now, have 16.1k trophies but still no legendaries...
---
So after you max out PowerPoints, do chests give you a lot more gold in place of power points or just 18-30 ish? I'm 5 brawlers away and I'm pretty curious
---
Disappointed this isn‚Äôt posted by timyteemo

Okay now I know

im Johor,your neighbor

how you so rich in Malaysia state

wait...

Singapore better
---
Its charizard!

Conspiracy
---
That's not true, I only kill Dynamikes when they are teaming and try to kill me. Otherwise, I just charge my Super on him and leave him, because its a bit unfair when someone can't protect themself and they get killed at the beginning of the match. At least this is my view.

"Why did he get downvoted?" People are jokingly guessing wrong, and this guy is going around correcting them like they don't know it. Imho it's kinda cringy and that's why he got downvotes.
---
That means u r a very good artist

Wow nice art

this has happened in 5 from 7 matches i played today, it lets my brawler move a little then cage's him

Darryl is just an hybrid of shelly and bull, there's no need to nerf him
---
When you buy a skin and wnat your money back,  you can't play a game with Leon in general otherwise it will write a permanent code that takes a lot of effort to reverse (yes, it's possible). Get the attention of mods on this subreddit and you might get your money back. I'd say just go with it, since Sally Leon is a pretty neat skin for the cost of 80. 
---
That's all i can say to you.

#And another one
---
In gem grab yes,in showdown no.
---
Pm me
---
Depends on who you are, someone posted their mega box have them three star powers, I haven't gotten a star power in 2 months or so.
---
lit. Congrats
---
Oh god
---
Tara! The best champ in my opinion, max this one who you prefer to play most
---
In the skies! I like it!
---
:D
---
...... Wizard barley
---
Where did you get that 2nd picture?
---
Cavern churn is good too. Tbh old maps are better than the newer ones, which feel so random. Also, anyone else notice island invasion hasn‚Äôt been in lonestar in a while, it was my favourite for the mode.
---
Tara ! üòÇ
---
Ok let me break it down for you
---
1. I am not maxed and this happened when band-aid was op
---
2. This clip has a higher chance for upvotes
---
3. People want to satisfication of destroying enemies not boring shooting from afar
---
4. Rosa had her super so I could not do that team and then walk into the gas thing
---
5. This could go on Coach Cory's best plays review
---
So go back to the hoes who summoned you from the dumb and think about what you said to me
---
BTW you just got destroyed by an ELEVEN YEAR OLD ASIAN
---
Finally an actual pro player
---
Yesss they are getting added (hopefully for starpoints and some special ones for gems maybe)
---
Good effects ! Amazing
---
r/ihadastroke
---
Seem staged.
---
now there are 2 new brawlers other than beesniper and spawnerdude in the game files the new ones are speedy and homer one of them has a turret that boosts reload speed
---
Now you can be extra toxic with spinning+ emojis! Nice one Supercell 2 in 1!

my life since i have all power point on every 30 brawler :'(

Naming yourself brawl talk doesn‚Äôt mean begging wtf?

hmmmmmm

colt if ur good with any of then the maxxed the one u like

Lol I don't get it

Nice skin idea
---
It is but apparently it‚Äôs good
---
One of them wanted my vid
---
Too rare man. It's kind of absurd imo how rare they are. You spend months getting everyone to lvl 9 then you have to spend potentially years before you get all 60 star powers? They should make it so that every time you open a box your chances increases, just like with legendary brawlers. If you've opened 300 boxes (like I have) and haven't gotten a single SP your chance should still be a miserable 1%. Let people who buy gems and boxes and spend money have a decent chance of getting sp too man, it's ridiculous.
---
ios or android
---
Or just add an option for no AI, no poison clouds and modifiers toggle
---
Android
---
they need a sniper, or one with like drones...just saying
---
Only emojis we really need are "Pass the fucking ball!" and "Fall back you moron!".
---
Okay? Gonna cry? Honestly this probably your internet connection and this is how the game handles it: you left your team in the middle of the match? You don‚Äôt deserve the trophies. You left the team before the match and they lost? You deserve the negative trophies. I advice you to get better a connection.
---
Where do you find these
---
Perfect spot. This actually a thing since Piper‚Äôs bombs are now on fixed places.
---
Yes i have alot of holy water for everyone-
---
What the hell?
---
Honestly stop this kind of shitposting. Nobody needs it and nobody cares (for the one that is going to say I do: ok boomer)

Where is part two??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????

I clone piper 2 times üòé

I can't nerf the sh*t out f you without getting closer
---
I‚Äôd probably say Tara cuz of triple kill super
---
Is r/terriblegamemes a thing?
---
I got 12 in a small box
---
where did you find it
---
Because client side you move. But your ping is way to high so on the server side you don‚Äôt move. This causes the client and server to get out of sinc and therefore the server kicks you for bad internet
---
Hmmmm well do you see the uno cards?
---
Damn those 3 tickets tho
---
Ohhh thanks that makes sense
---
YES!
---
LEON GANG
---
Nice you got it
---
Instagram "rlighton" on the backround

Well played
---
I have been Rick rolled 3 times today fuk
---
extract game files and find the csv files
---
How about the third brawler?
---
Me too... have 14.2k atm but haven‚Äôt got any legendaries yet... playing since beta. Ain‚Äôt complaining because I love the game
---
^     v   ^ yes that's true plus I would never repost without giving credit thank you god bless you
---
13 000 trophies :/
---
13000 =)

yes i think

I actually made the meme but then realised you can't share images on threads üòß.

No, you can get a mega box, and potentially a brawler
---
Are you Pay2Win?
---
True lol &lt;3
---
no
---
Not true ¬¶|
---
That‚Äôs big D energy
---
Yes, if you spend all the tickets in robo rumble (20x), and get around 5:50-6:00 every time, you get about 24 boxes. 
---
Other offers, such as megaboxes, only offer about 10 boxes worth.
---
It's called a top hat...
---
Me 2.
---
Old lone star and takedown maps got replaced by new maps. I like the current maps, because they are symethrical and open but they all feel the same. Island invasion was just 6-10 Shellys in a match. I think both game modes should get a wider meta, because in both game modes only a handful of brawlers works well. Sorry if my English is bad, not a native speaker.
---
Stonks
---
LMAO I literally was saying that out loud right before I read that
---
No
---
What
---
Try press friendly game button, and leave from that
---
Wow... i have 13 800 trophies and no legendary... 
---
Congrats ü•≥!
---
Me: I will get a legendary
---
Ryan: WRONG
---
A bit small for a showdown map isn't it?
---
Ik that megaboxes are not really worth it, it's just that i wonder if even better deals are gonna come on christmas
---
Dang it I commented something about the Obama meme when I saw it in new!
---
I fixed it I‚Äôm just showing it
---
That‚Äôs almost a box in a box
---
All human brawlers: ***sad noises***
---
Jk this is really good art
---
Wth are you talking bout??!! Is this just too complicated for me? Probably yes...
---
I live in Belgium
---
You can just upload it to reddit/youtube/google drive, as you wish!
---
Yeah it is...you're only going to get 300 coins for achieving 13000 trophies :P
---
you were teaming, so downvoted
---
Skin 2 Win
---
Wait what?!
---
That doesn't look like a drawing... 
---
Wow that is amazing
---
   
---
I think not, because in the animation of the game he appears holding the guitar with his hand, so his right hand is free
---
I'm still mentally in 2018.
---
SD everytime
---
i rather cavern churn than the old map named eye of the storm
---
Wen ETA s0n ?
---
Poco
---
Rename the a.p.k. of brawl stars to z.i.p. and unpack (the dots are for the modbot)
---
He has guitar in his right hand just look closer
---
Cool
---
please stop posting this multiple times
---
give me free stuff!!!!1!!1!!!!

That's so sweetüòªüòªüòª
---
nickname checks out

You won but.. Rico is star player
---
Thank you. ^  w ^
---
 sorry, I wish I said he should hold with his left hand
---
i dont get it why it s so damn lagged  
---
@supercell : cant you add some perf debug option ? (used server, rtt, ...)  
---
i checked aws connectiviy : [http://ec2-reachability.amazonaws.com/](http://ec2-reachability.amazonaws.com/) , and it s ok
---
latency towards aws global services (same ip as page above) also ok

strange, i have 3 legendaries and i have 0.2264% drop rate

They are annoying!

---
What a luck
---
No problem i also saw this post from other guy and he said that they asked which brawler is best for christmas skin
---
I know that this game modes are shit
---
would be the opposite of the game animation
---
Omg it works
---
I have a Mariachi Sans in Rank 20 too!
---
These thumbnails are soooo annoying
---
At first I thought this was a cosplay until I saw the title.
---
Then all the game names will change to country names good idea üôÉ
---
Well of course I'm alive
---
Well I didn't mean he won duo showdown, I meant he could have got 4th or 5th because I'm pretty sure one of those give 2 trophies when you are rank 1, but I didn't notice the 3v3 win so I have no idea how it happened
---
You want a legendary? Open boxes. You still don‚Äôt have it? Open more boxes. There‚Äôs nothing more to say, no free things for people who think they have bad luck
---
YoU ThTiink amA NiT
---
Nothing against tracing or references. I‚Äôd be lying if said I didn‚Äôt like how they made that into a Jessie pic, but it may have been better if they used the pic to help them draw something that‚Äôd resemble Jessie in their own style rather than tracing details down to the line. You stand to gain more potentially when you use references to learn and aid you in expressing your vision rather than having them be the foundation and complete base of your pic. Ik I‚Äôm not so great at art but in my experience, it‚Äôs way harder to develop that way.
---
Barley Pam and Shelly
---
sorry bud, supercell wont help you with that.
---
you buy it you own it, forever.

feels bad

also

**just look at that hand.**

I should hire his as my personal trainer.

Can you stop whit the emojis

hope this makes it

No news is good news.
---
Sad. i tought it was at 500, everything is ruined now.
---
I used star points tho
---
f
---
Now that I look at it more carefully kinda looks like Leon but nah that's Sandy
---
Never fight someone who can DMG you and the box at the same type while you can't. You're gonna loose
---
Yea that does make sense, because if you get to accustomed to tracing then you lose the ability to be creative and improve your own talents.
---
BlAh bLah BlAh I gOt 12 FrOm a RnDoM BoX fuck of normie

Wow thanks

Great art though

Tracing is stealing, it‚Äôs not your work, especially when credit is not given when due
---
But how is spamming the link to replies toxic? Are you saying I should've only showed it to 1 person? Idk what you're so mad about. How is someone supposed to see the link if I didn't send it to them. Stop being so weird and harass someone else
---
It‚Äôs not gonna ,just accept it.

What are you saying

Shiver me timbers!

I‚Äôd love to see a new poco skin. The serenade one is so cool, I bet a winter themed one would be too

Why is Brock called a Rocket Girl?

Yes me too I'm tired of using seranade poco fore the longest time hes still a great skin thank you fore voting

Name her Zyla

Bunny Penny, try to draw her pls

I'm, sorry???

The turrets are off center

Face is worst part imo

&gt;But when I see shelly, i already can predict it's not going to go well.

This is true in pretty much any 3v3 game, honestly. Shelly mainers r dumb and Shelly is garbo
---
you just linked his own post awk

karma??

I'm not spamming the link to every user. What part of 1 per person do you not understand? Spamming would be if I sent multiple links to 1 person. 
---
Idc if it's on hot, I'm allowed to answer peoples questions and/or give closure to their comments
---
And speaking of no one asked for. No one asked for you to be so toxic, you're probably a friend/alt of the dude who posted this little effort art
---
I never said the art was bad, it's just not high effort, idc what you're so worked up about
---
Shelly, because....boom
---
Spike, because can slow them down
---
Sandy, because can turn me invisible

I want frank to see this
