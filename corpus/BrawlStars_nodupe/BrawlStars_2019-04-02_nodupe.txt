I hope everyone likes this map idea!

Nice touch to the apron

FYI it should be u/ not r/ for your name 
---
Umm why should u get something u had spike and ur only at 1200 trophies meanwhile I‚Äôm sitting at 7000 trophies with no legendary 
---
WHAT A LONG HAT.

YOU HAVE SOME BAD DAYS.

---
I got Mortis in the shop instead r/mortisgang
---
What's death valley?
---
Please I'm begging you buff crow
---
I know that will added in april update, had I known wrong?
---
It‚Äôs not my account. You should open more boxes then lol. My main account is at like 2100 and I have crow. My alt account is at like 700 or so. And I have spike.
---
I don't thing my phone has one, it sucks
---
I mean... the tittle is true...
---
Here we see 6 Dynamikes teaming in their natural habitats... as you can see, the poison gas is slowly surrounding them and the poor Night Witch Mortis and Wizard Barley, but soon... Natural selection shall takes its course...
---
I‚Äôm 7700 and have 23. I just got piper and Carl so they are low
---
As if shooting through walls isn't more me mechanical than shooting, running back.
---
A new map for you all. Again criticism is welcome on how to improve it!
---
Oh fuck. poor transmortis
---
This does put a smile on my face
---
I dont think they can put 3 block thick walls in a boss battle due to dynamike though :(
---
Bring in a whole bunch of throwers and it really is an archer tower
---
He means the C in RiCo.

No I couldn't tell üò± congrats on that gold star.

Lol I actually lost 10 Siege battles by playing with randoms... if I knew I wouldn‚Äôt have :(

---
Get off me!
---
Yes a voice I have Tara a long time and I have bean wondering what Che would sound like 
---
Yup, tryna find a good team is hard, and yes randoms are sometimes not the best, there‚Äôs a lot that may have skipped the tutorial cause that‚Äôs I feel like they did, I prefer solo‚Äôs but some idiots thought it was Duo Showdown cause they are just teaming when it is ‚ÄúEvery brawler for themselves‚Äù but yeah, playing with bad randoms is not fun
---
I think I'm in the minority, but gem grab is by far my favorite mode and showdown my least.
---
I haven't actually ever tried crow in heist, I kind of thought he'd be terrible at it. Is there a good strategy I could read up on somewhere?
---
I've got good luck in bounty but most of my wins have come from gem grab. I actually find he's a great deterrent, people are scared of the poison and I can often keep them away from the gem spawn. And taking down the over-confident Primo holding all the gems by staying just out of reach is always fun in a sadistic sort of way. I can feel him raging...
---
So yeah I do gem grab with him and it doesn't seem that bad to me. Unless there's a Pam or a Poco, in which case I'm basically useless.
---
Though clearly I can't push past 400 so I guess it's not that great! Thanks for the advice.
---
**Noice**

Too op, wouldnt be fair and its a no from me. Sorreh :(

Yes, because the old post had an error with the title, and since there is no way to correct it, I deleted the old one and put this one.

Yeah. I could taste the delicious rabies and dirty feathers it just tickles my tummy yum
---
I have *and won* https://youtu.be/VYSvUNS4YYs
---
youloseiwin
---
The worst have been a few that intentionally threw the game (just sit at spawn and spin), that is super frustrating.
---
Siege was really bad for a while at first, like no one seemed to get it at all. Half the time at least one team mate would stay back to defend the IKE... like, ok, we're done.
---
Nostalgia

IT'S MA'AM

_Teaming with the poison gas in Showdown_
---
You forgot always conveniently in the bush right next to you when low on health 
---
Bruh...
---
Because that map is a joke.
---
Gotta rock 2 shellys that can super chain orever
---
Or an April fools joke?
---
Yea, I feel like we should have the ability to block the player so we dont match up with them trash players, cause ik it sounds harsh but what‚Äôs also harsh is them throwing the match and us losing 10 trophies, and I rarely see them defend, I am literally always defending with my life
---
Why did you make a Davids Stars?
---
Definitely, but it should sound super muffled
---
If only it were real
---
Yep, shes used the most under 440ish trophies but brawlstats brawler reqs are based on Kairos's Competitive Tier list 
---
Lol, same happened to me with my Poco
---
I only use 1 email really and it's connected to my phone so there is no password required.
---
Lol
---
That‚Äôs the point
---
Wow, that was pretty good. Good work!
---
And to think that there was a time during beta when she wasn‚Äôt good.....
---
How?
---
What in the
---
XD true
---
1. Combine Primo‚Äôs hp with Crows speed and attack, and pair that with shelly‚Äôs super.
---
This is way too op, basically the meta knight do brawl stars.
---
2. If all you are doing is taking existing attacks and specials than this brawler isn‚Äôt actually adding anything to the game, it may change it because of Op it is but it won‚Äôt offer anything entire new.
---
3. The concept in itself isn‚Äôt new
---
I didnt even downvote you...
---
Yes, agreed! I wrote to Supercell asking about a block button. I was told no, you can write to them to report profane usernames but that‚Äôs it.
---
They did send me a couple of gems for my trouble so I guess that‚Äôs nice.
---
Then stop using Crow as a shot gun brawler and use him like nails.
---
Wait,,,, did you get chicken dinner ?
---
Dont get too excited to get crow. Depression sets in
---
Okay im starting to do it... I hate Nita
---
I was about to downvote, then I read the whole thing. Take an upvote. 
---
I feel your pain, i was opening a mega box that I bought but didn't get anything. Then I got a token big box I was about to get leon, but my phone powered off before the game saved my brawler, when I got onto brawl stars again, i had the big box but not the brawler. I opened it but didn't get anyhting. Just play more games and open more boxes and you might get something new
---
Whos Morris
---
He got 404 trophies. Just as the typical ‚Äúerror 404‚Äù
---
I lost over 100+ trophies with randoms and I was wondering, how bad are you suppose to be to not be able to defend and not even be able to aim, it was in heist and they kept dying, I am sick of these randoms and few gems are not gonna make me feel better, not even a 100 gems, since that will mean nothing to me, I want my trophies back not gems
---
Haha i guess sry for ruining the joke

Nope because not all of them have star powers so I‚Äôm gonna assume you don‚Äôt play sd with a 400+ brawler before so you never witnessed it but it happens pretty often ngl

You just disproved your claim. You said the guy with less trophies than you isn't good.

Sit in a bush in showdown

uh no use the crow format

It‚Äôs amusing watching them die out one by one

very uncanny similarity to sans the skeleton

I just got Crow today and this was almost exactly what I was thinking for a buff. 
---
Numbah 3 ma lord!
---
Dude its just an idea supercell can always change it its the brawler concept that mattersüòÄ
---
Make her disabled then
---
What about Crow not really being able to make plays?  You never address that, and that was one of my main points.  I never reaaallllyyyy disagreed with what you said, if the Meta‚Ñ¢ shifted he would still not be great.  Also, chip is boring.  Like really boring.  Prioritize enjoyment over balance (if you buff a character to make them op it won't make the game more fun).  I wonder why all the assassin characters get played so much.  Hmmmm...
---
Holy shit bro I‚Äôm at 9k and barely got there with 24 brawlers
---
Dude, you have spike,piper,frank and Carl be grateful.

So fake

One of them could‚Äôve thrown their ult and one normal attack and been drowning in cubes

As I have said before. This is not my account. You would not be happy if you saved boxes for a while and opened them and got nothing. This is my friends account. You guys really need to read before you comment something like this.

I like how you named the map after the Minecraft challenge to ricochet a ghast fireball back at the ghast

Only problem with this brawler is that the game is based on the wild west. Someone like her wouldn't fit in with the theme.

All but 2 of mine are at 12 at least. Pam is one of the two (she's at 10).

Oh ok, robo rumble is a ticketed event and it unlocks at 350 trophies. There are curretly 3 ticketed events; robo rumble, big game and boss fight. You need to pay tickets to play them. Every weekend one of them is open. Next weekend it is robo rumble.

In robo rumble you and two other people have to defend the safe from robots. Longer you defend, better the rewasrd!

I do too. The strings of losses get bad sometimes.

It‚Äôs easy to check for Darryl and primo bc they camp in small bushes. In maps like cavern churn they lose to Shelly/bull every time

Probably yes, he must have seen me checking the bushes. He might have though it was too risky to reveal himself to the dynas and left me alone.
---
I'd say money isn't the be-all that it is in CR, but it's still a large factor.
---
Head over to r/brawlstarscompetitive for competitive stuff 
---
Remember that this affects your opponents as well. So it‚Äôs balanced. 
---
Cool until you realize the map will consist in 10 shelly or Bull hiding in the middle till the very end. It needs separation between bushes
---
Believe me I would have if I'd had my super charged up
---
Skeletons can be wiped out in 1 shot by any AOE damage brawler. 
---
Actually that legendary percentage is very high compared to the rest of the player base. 
---
It blows my mind how randoms play like noobs sometimes even at 500 trophy level

Imagine all the clickbait on YouTube with 6 pipers

Damn this shit is soo fake

You are the 1000th person who suggests this.
---
Agreed
---
Aight, aight. I can agree with Leon being overrated. Right now I don't play him much since I recently got Crow, so I need to push him up. I honestly don't believe Leon is the WORST legendary brawler. I simply believe he's GOOD. Not OP, not UP (underpowered), just good. As for Tara... Well, she's also okay, I have the same thoughts with the "her being good in Brawl Ball" part. But not Showdown. Well, maybe Duo, but not Solo. She's also pretty good in Gem Grab, but not much good in any other game mode. These are my opinions on your opinion.
---
Not every dynamike teams

Nah, i'my pretty sure it's the double chin

how much trophies you have?

Dude this is the best map for bounty... Its so nice because of the tactics u can use on this map. Use brock and piper to remove bushes to get an overview of the field for instance

Wow new skin? I like that! Now I will give you upvote. (Downvoted)

I didn‚Äôt get an April fools offer

I‚Äôve seen this but only at low trophy levels

Yeah that could work!

What in teh hell

Good man. Someone had to do it.

Science in a nutshell!

I got a token doubler of 80
---
On the spawn points i added 4 more to the middle and moved them around. Yes bull can trap other brawlers but that is why i put so much grass.

teaming in duo with everyone and stay in middle till the zone is killing us

Siege
---
Why would you pay for a star power the 1% chance is surprisingly high
---
I got leon on 300 cups on my mini accounts
---
Damn if only you had 80 tickets it would've been perfect
---
Nice one
---
Major Bad
---
What?
---
The pairing system is by brawler trophies not levels
---
Damn I believe this because here is actually 2nd

What what
---
Congrats on tilting so far!
---
Yep and thats why is stopped playing it
---
Thanks for repeating the same thing it's still my meme
---
jess is fine though....
---
It's crow
---
the walls look very professionally placed but theres too little cover around the edges of the map and around the center
---
Now this is starting to become low effort. Not funny anymore
---
I love that I lost this oportunity.
---
First day of Brawl Stars I got him. 
---
I dont believe this but broo this is actually a dream update, LIFE LEECH BACK? SHELLYS SUPER NERF? GEDI KOR SKINS???? MY GOD if this is rela it could be the best update ever üò±

Ok

HOW DID YOU ALREADY GET A LEGEND IM AT 4K TROPHIES AND STILL TRYING TO GET ONE
---
She's a goddamm sniper dressed up like a rich woman with a gun hide in a umbrella and pretending to be nice smilling all the time despite having a constant desire to kill you....How wouldn't the plague skin fit to that?
---
Actually that's true
---
I hope to see this kind of map on showdown

Yah lol just got him actually, I guess I'm just really lucky. Hope you get one soon! Gl!

You deserve the Spike then!

_Teaming with the brawl ball_

Lol I can see little hamsters spinning in the air after being shot out of a gun

Yeah I agree, I‚Äòm getting angry if I lose because of lag, but I would escalate if I would also get a ban for that. 
---
Are you intentionally quoting Brock's voiceline?
---
I hope
---
Git gud heheheh
---
What is this post about?
---
I wish I new this when I first started. I ended up getting poco and then barely from a brawl box. It took me forever to get el primo afterwards, which delayed the process of me getting the other super rares as well. My friends who started at the same time as me are forever ahead of me in terms of brawler amount now. 
---
4K isn‚Äôt that much

Not brawl stars related

In case you need to see the text / image better

I got banned. But you are in a worse situation me. So good luck. And yeah supercell we both are innocent.
---
And can U tell me what is it MAMM, if i post map today, will it in next Monday "tour" or not?
---
r/iamverysmart
---
Same thing happened to me. Which doesn't make sense. My purchases were declined because I had a problem from my bank. After a few days I fixed my card but I did not know all my purchases would go through, and so I received a text saying I was charged for about 700 gems, which is stupid since I didn't want to purchase that many, I had only tried to keep purchasing thinking there was a problem with the app itself. Also I never received any of the gems that I "bought" but still received a negative gem count. Brawl stars is just scammed us, forcing us to add more gems in order to get a positive gem count. Plain and simple.

I actually got spike before barley

This game isn't p2w at all compared to other games. Ever seen game of war?

I do not play with pam, it's level 6 because I use it in robo rumble

Nerf crow

BEST. ANIME. EVER

Nope

Nice
---
That‚Äôs in a different currency! That‚Äôs the equivalent of 1 Billion Coins!
---
No, but 200 is actually a lot already. It used to be 100, so if I‚Äôm not wrong you had to go on the game every 12 hours to get all tokens while now it‚Äôs 24 hours
---
That happen when you lose in #10 place :c 
---
Omg best skin ever!
---
 and whose map was chosen?

i dont get it

YAY I got this!!

No /s.

Works fine when I use cell data but lags if i use wifi.

Doesn't lag if I hold the phone as if it was covered in shit (aka with fingertips or not touch it). It's lame.

Strong independent black mother

You got it!

yes. ice hockey in brawl stars

Not impressed

I‚Äôd buy every single one of your skins. The only skin better then yours that super cell made is Phoenix crow.

Its just a replay of a good showdown match dont worry
---
What stop
---
Does Finland even have a hockey team?? üòÅ
---
It was the sacred number... But two ppl upvoted...
---
rico with star power is more than enough
---
Yeah, but opening 100 brawl boxes does not guarantee you a Star Power. And it will take you around 50 days to get 100 boxes (if you have no Token Doublers or Event Tickets). By purchasing the Star Power, he can just enjoy the Star Power Leon and have fun instead of waiting 2 months for the unlocking process. At least that is more fun in my opinion.

Very cool

I did. Just confused as to why I had it.

---
Yes you are right...
---
I don't know about the balances, but 
---
&gt;SKULLS: Mortis's and Frank's star power's skulls would be vicible for everyone (but other brawlers can't pick them, or maybe teammates).

the skull star powers don't exist anymore, so this is useless

Frank with perms-stun

oh I ser
---
This sound really fake... It would be good, but... It's a bit unbelievable

i think too many people play him the wrong way as well. he‚Äôs meant to be an assassin, not someone to run in and tank damage. i think he‚Äôs pretty ok for now.

happy cake day!

Um, Pam, Jessie, and Colt are from West Virginia... do I need to explain what that means?
---
What is brawl TV?
---
Thank you! üòÅ

Seems very weak still... Buff crow
---
It's the same concept, and Pam's attack is basically that concept made workable in the game. This is just a bad idea, and also really bad design, doesn't fit at all into Brawl stars

Change it to what?

It really do be like that

Define flawed, unfair, and repetitive? I don‚Äôt think they should earn any trophies with these brawlers. Someone with 20 brawlers all at 500 trophies could be able to get over 11k trophies easy without ever having to use the brawlers he/she has? Think about the p2p players.
---
I have no mates that play this game that‚Äôs the issue, it‚Äôs just frustrating I have to play with people haha
---
no it‚Äôs not. You mean his ? Mines higher and it will take more than 100 boxes to get a legendary. Have you seen kairos vid ? The change of getting a legendary is rigged af

How did you do it, then?

I‚Äôm completely mind blown and confused.

I mean, don't misunderstand me, please. This is just my opinion. I totally agree that he designs some awesome skins, but he is not some celebrity, right? 
---
I think some people would agree with me, about how Brawl Stars has kinda become a "GEDI-KOR NEEDS A JOB AT SUPERCELL" sub. 
---
Siege is SO MUCH FUN!  
---
Especially with good Brawlers. Gene is a magician here... he can pull the robot and pants people.
---
he was a skater boy
---
r/brawlstarscompetitive
---
Siege Fuck? 
---
Still too weak, buff more
---
I see where you are coming from but if you compare him, to say Leon, Leon moved at the same speed, outranges him, and deals more damage per blade at Max range as well as being able to hit all blades at Max range and has more health. Crow has his poison but I feel it's just not enough.
---
Well no the amount of teams is fine but they should 
---
I think it's just luck. It's a good spot to guess for the Gene. It's kind of like when people shoot in brawl ball and it lands right at the goal line and doesn't go in, or the ball is about to go in but the time expires. Good/bad luck happens constantly in brawl stars lol it's just part of the game.
---
It's the same for every box no matter how many you have.
---
Actually it‚Äôs different. It‚Äôs not a clear way there are obstacles.
---
Are you serious? I want the lore where they reveal that Tara is just Shelly from the future
---
Let me explain my idea a bit better, there is an area near your robot spawner that has 2 circles. If 2 people from the same team go into the circles a robot will spawn for them. This way you can collect bolts and save them until you want to use. Bolts stop spawning when a robot is made but otherwise spawn increasingly faster as time goes on. 
---
?
---
+0.1s better reload speed sorry
---
You down for some city snipes? Or are you looking for a donnybrook?
---
Siege sucks and you know it. Gene is a magician anywhere, and the best place for his magic is solo showdown where that slot belongs!üò§
---
Where is the life leech??
---
What do you mean lol
---
This map has 0 fighting potential.. throwers would be completely useless and crow/spike would be literally op here. Overthink that.

¬°Absolutely adorable! Good job

So cute:3

This is SO annoying, we need a fix!

Nice idea but there‚Äôs no remedy to that terrible game mode. It sucks and it will always suck.

Posting this to KnowYourMeme as you breathe...

It should be +8 +4 0 -4 -8
---
yes
---
New game mode Infection
---
This is actually one of the best ideas you have come up to so far
---
This is just slightly modified snake prairie 
---
Just do one of the following. 
---
1. Reduced attack range
---
2. Reduced hp
---
3. Reduced damage.
---
I would go with 2 or 3. 
---
As Pam with Star Power pumps out a lot of healing. So let that be her role. 
---
Still good i got leon at 4200 trophies and it‚Äôs very lucky you‚Äôll see peuple with 8k trophies with no legendaries yet 
---
I only play ball (only fun mode in my opinion) and heist which isnt that fun but I‚Äôm decent at it. All others just don‚Äôt feel fun
---
Gostei man. Muito top
---
Too weak. Buff reload speed.
---
This is what happens when you chew 5 gum.
---
Brawl ball over all
---
I agree with you just not heist, too many bad players get lucky.
---
Yep
---
Apparently the higher the trophies you are, the more god awful, oblivious, borderline retarded teammates are matched up with you
---
œÑŒµŒ±Œú 
---
True plus it‚Äôs bull heaven
---
*Nintendo wants to know your location*
---
No
---
Yep, run at you with a bulk of health than charge the safe blindly.
---
Press F
---
Square or circle are the two best options. Mostly square.
---
Well bull naturally counters mortis as mortis counters dynamite, and mortis can just stay out of bulls way for the most part.
---
And removing autoaim would make huge majority of players upset, supercell could be looking at lossing as much as 50% of playerbase if not maybe even more.
---
Supercell used the mechanics with carl, that's literally what this post is saying. Also you didn't even edit your comment.
---
Same here. I guess we're lucky since we're not bothered by teamers.
---
I would kill for real dual sticks and buttons to fire. It'd be a whole different game.
---
They meant star tokens 
---
Man this one is even better than mine!!! 
---
My version made Colt be the spoiled narcisist, still being the sheriff the was kind of selfish until the moment someone gets in danger.
---
He would also be a distant member from the junker family.
---
Amazing how you connected Colt and Helly there :3
---
KEEP IT UP PLEASE!!!
---
I could see this being a skin! Super: Huge hockey puck with shaved ice flying around.
---
Spike should have his black voice from the old commercial
---
Shelly isn't even good in this map, the only reason you're seeing so many is because you're low in trophies. I mean with your shelly, not trying to say anything bad.
---
Ah right 
---
Eh but it whould look good
---
Yeah fuck teamers I hate them so hard
---
Damn that‚Äôs a stretched picture
---
I was thinking of doing that but I thought this was too strong...
---
You think so? I'd imagine it's just out range but if not then maybe it's not such a bad idea. 
---
I'd try it but I'm so tilted with Piper already I'm scared to lose 8 more trophies.
---
then don't team
---
It‚Äôs not that I have a legendary. It‚Äôs that I don‚Äôt have many brawlers. Anew brawler = free 300 trophies. So it‚Äôs hard to push with only 15. 
---
Pfft that‚Äôs rookie stuff
---
I tried to do something pretty questionable with this picture for 2 hours üí™üò§üëå
---
Yeah sorry about that, the editor I used was mainly horizontally so it looks stretchy, I probably lost 100 upvotes becuase of that :p
---
Well yeah it‚Äôs just out of range but if you run in, shoot one shot, and run out you‚Äôll still be at about 1000 health to let you regenerate I believe
---
Nope. Don‚Äôt have Carl either. Just Leon.
---
Supercell? Are you taking notes?
---
I literally carry the team and my team doesn‚Äôt do shit and I lose almost 90% of the time cuz these shits decide they lost a chunk of their brain
---
Your skins are shit
---
DoWnVoTe
---
Let me fix that title
---
[Idea] give me free shit
---
Sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo True.
---
Of course, i‚Äôm not denying who counters who. It shouldn‚Äôt be cut and dry ‚ÄúI counter you so i win because I have an aimbot and you don‚Äôt‚Äù though. Aim should be put into play to give people a chance. 
---
It‚Äôs like a sniper vs pistol long range, no aimbot = a chance the pistol can win.
---
Changes have risks, them going from portrait to landscape was well received, who‚Äôs to say this isn‚Äôt either?
---
Let‚Äôs look at another popular game - Fortnite. If they nerfed how good aim assist was players wouldn‚Äôt quit the game, they‚Äôd come back to it because it‚Äôs a good game, just like brawlstars.
---
Yeah and you probably have like 3000 trophies so it‚Äôs no big deal if you lose a match meanwhile when you get around 7-12k trophies every loss is like a slap in the face
---
They can just guard where the enemies land and kill them 
---
Please give mortis a giant dash 
---
This, it scares me. 
---
I hated it until it reminded me of skeletor
---
Why am I the sux?
---
Don't use Barley in siege

Mostly because of their expectations that keep getting higher and higher for themselves. But I agree, I really like this, I wouldn't say it's useless.

Barley is free (with supercell id) and amazing at low trophies because down there the enemy team always clumps up and goes straight for the choke (and then you can kill them all)
---
Thanks!üî•
---
maybe they should have a "challenge mode" where you lose more trophies when you lose but win more when you win and get more tokens, kinda like siege
---
Leon: subscribe to the pewds
---
Poco's is so bad, its like a white guy trying to sound Spanish. Mortises is alright, annoying but it kind of fits him. Genes is garbage lol, sounds like they were waterboarding the voice actor

It would be great skin!

its a server issue. they need to fix it.

Maybe a new brawler with a brawler icon of them winking? Not that such information would tell us much about an actual brawler mechanically though (I think).

You can get Barley for free though
