Crow with extra toxic

This colt suck
---
I don't think rush wars will kill brawl stars. Supercell's last few games have all been totally unike, and i expect Rush Wars to be incredibly different from anything we've seen from them.
---
Well, they said this monday will be the soft launch, and they soft launched all their games on the beta countrys, so it will be available for everyone after the global launch, but no one knows how long or if it even goes global, so at monday it'll be available for the beta countrys

The super area is too big

Yet every mortis Auto-Aim's

So pretty much airbrush work? Good job!

Dude I don‚Äôt know if this is a coincidence or not but I think someone stole Shelly and Nita star power ideas I‚Äôll type his name in Endor this post

The other person can‚Äôt talk, so it‚Äôs Leon, or spike(unlikely) so probably Leon

 I wonder if r/rushwars exist

You can also adjust it, in the picture there like sliders to adjust and fix it to your needs

are you playing gem?

Who the heck is Bobby?

I can kill spike with my tick

DO YOU FOLLOW THE CONDUCTOR‚ÄôS LEAD?

Coach Corey too

HHAHAHAH
---
"i can kill energy drink spike with my tick "
---
i suppose that's what you're trying to say
---
It's probably because u don't have Crow or Bo. U should have 6 rotating thru, but because those r the only two brawlers u have, those r the only two star skins u have in ur shop
---
Oh no spike can one shot me
---
At 97 trophies? Probably a fake. Did u check the profile?

you're behind a huge wall and that spike is on the other side

That seems pretty hype. But now idk how I‚Äôm going to play brawl and rush at the same time lool

Good at as always chronos. Keep up the great work!

My name is Crow, you took my cube that I wasted a million shots to get, prepare to die

Hey!! You‚Äôre that guy that made the cool music video post that very few saw!! It was nice.

I really hate that but I don‚Äôt know why supercell do that so my comment is pointless.

Rush war is a Tactical shooter, just like X-Com. My guess.
---
Supercell has different "cells" that work on separate games. For example, Clash of clans and Hay day people don't work together on one game. So Brawl Stars should, in theory, stay alive as long as Clash of Clans or longer unless everyone quits the Brawl Stars dev team

Band aid dyna jump and snappy sniping

---
r/shittybrawlstars
---
that's not what the problem is. not everyone has time and money to spend on  3 to 6 games.  if supercell themselves advertise their game and players like the new one then they might simply leave old ones. also in new games they are trying to develop playerbase so offers also tend to be better which attracts more players. there is boredom from old games too as repetitive gameplay and slow progress can  also make players leave while new game will have fresh gameplay.people are also  skeptical because of how much clash royale was ruined in terms of offers and balance while reducing progress a no. of times.
---
Mortis in showdown basically
---
10k gene+mortis+leggies missing
---
This looks so nsfw lol
---
It‚Äôs still gonna have teaming
---
Said everyone who is trash at taking out a brawler alone
---
SHELL GOT BAND AID AND BOIIIIII
---
Why are people thinking the wrong way? It just art
---
I probably have, coz I always check the wiki but I don't really care about Mortis so :P

Wait is Carl based partly on Carl Wheezer probably not but I want the answer to be correct

It still ultimately wouldn‚Äôt be the determining factor because all brawlers aren‚Äôt at the same Power level. Power cubes give lower level brawlers a chance to even the playing field, and even become stronger when they started weaker.
---
Bruh I had to buy mine for 2 gold.

Was he baiting the rockets?

The matchmaking puts it together so its more fair against a organized team comp and the person with the most trophies is the RANGE you will play in. I think its total trophies

May I ask how do you draw it like that and post it online.

Look at my post it is worst

needs to stay in its' own genre or bs is fucked
---
Honestly imo I feel like brawl stars is just repeating clash royale. It was fun in beta but now I‚Äôm at 14.4k and the game feels boring to play due to same trash updates after global release
---
When was penny‚Äôs turret names?
---
Dark I know you :).Come back to J for Jericho soon
---
Pffft
---
Aka da capo
---
Hmmm
---
It's dead already

Leon is right beside him

Also I am pissed about auto aim and barely playing the game because of it, so I hope rush is way better.
---
You posted this like 2 hours ago, we arent that stupid, stop trying to cover up your karma farming
---
Yeh dood
---
If there's teamers or people clumped up in an area (in this case the center) the other RESPONSIBLE BRAWLER who isn't teaming gets a healing mush.
---
LOL. Like Crow. üòÇ
---
I don't think Supercell would restore your account. If you got banned permanently by Supercell (account phishing), there's probably a good reason behind it with enough evidence that you phished. I'm sorry for your account loss but it would take a miracle for Supercell to unban your account. :(
---
I have a bandaid shelly and a thirst to clap robot cheeks, will that work?

WhyI don‚Äôt know how I due that

*this
---
My bad
---
I don't know the exact ways, but when Brawl Stars came out many people still got it though they weren't in one of the beta countries. Anyway, it's against the terms of Supercell, so even if I knew how to do it I wouldn't recommend it.
---
Bandaid is as powerful as a hack tho to be fair
---
Oki, but please, dont use her again, you can use her but lower the change of winning, she hardly can deal damage with her super, and is bad on some maps
---
Are you being serious? Prove it... 
---
show me the other post

Cause I never posted this on here

Ur post is shit

Good luck reporting the problem. As someone on this subreddit said, supercell is a profitable company, not a costumer care company.

Sorry for that

She probably got fucked by carl.
---
Yep i played that Match and i was holy shit why Did i do that
---
LOOK AT YOUR FRICKING POST HISTORY ITS NOT THAT HARD
---
Lucky? Imo all three players with only one type of brawler is the opposite of lucky.
---
This is bad combo
---
Wait, Darryl finally can speak?

Oops... my bad. I posted the same video twice!

Bounty is also an iconic game mode and isn't a permanent game mode. Gem grab is too complicated and is the least fun game mode. Heist and Bounty are the simpliest game modes, while Brawl Ball is the most fun.

I just reached 11000 trophies a couple days ago plz dont let this happen

Almost.. In bounty if you kill your enemy you know you get those stars. But here only one kill counts as one kill and thats it

Clash royale is still alive so is clash of clans
---
If they would make 6 game mode slots, that would mean 6 star tokens a day, which means less money. 6*7 is 42, and if we add an event star token, that's 43! Now we get 4*7 = 28 + plus event token which is 29. 14 star tokens more per week!

Brawl Stars was in beta before fortnite
---
im a little late but i have a few suggestions!  
---
first of all, i'd say make the mod team a little more dedicated to removing reposts to keep the subreddit fun to browse in new and like the top page.  
---
second of all i'd suggest some merged flairs, Ill explain how.   
---
Some people struggle with what flair to pick when posting something that shows 2 things that apply to a flair.  
---
And others say these posts are using the wrong flair.  
---
For example, lets say i was to post a meme, but it would have brawl stars artwork that i made, do i choose the humor flair, or the art flair?   
---
And if i was to post a Funny replay, do i choose the humor flair or the replay flair?  
---
Same goes for ideas, strategies, and so on.  
---
Id suggest adding these:  
---
Humor|Art  
---
Humor|Replay  
---
Screenshot  
---
Strategy|Replay  
---
Idea|Discussion

No auto aim?

Im interested

I remember in beta searching which is the best brawler for bone box and a video said Poco then I pushed Poco from 150 to 270 good times

And then SUrpRisee!!!!! To max out Rush Wars you need to spend $10,000 ü§£ü§£ or grind for free at least 3 years  ü§£

I just hope Rush Wars only need $1000 to max out like brawl stars.

So brawl stars.
---
Bruh it‚Äôs only master and u couldn‚Äôt defeat I used mortis and I still managed to win
---
I‚Äôm not an idot
---
Wow nice
---
This happens when you only push one brawler, and then loose a few times in a row. They are all bots that have a very interesting auto-aim : if there is a box near them, they will always target other people without shooting at the box that is right next to them. So supercell trying to hide things from us ? I solved the mystery
---
Yeah, and they kept putting high level players with them, and then they are matched against all high level brawler. It‚Äôs unfair to the guy they put with them.

Brawl stars was shit for a long time and looking like it might not go global at all. It took them tons of major changes and nearly two years from bete to actually release it.

I see no hint of any signs you might have done an abnormally good scale drawing, and it matches up perfectly line for line when you put a transparent crow pfp over it.

Pinned weekly rant thread. I want to go somewhere and post about how Bibi picked up all the gems then proceeded to die where if he let me (Mortis) take them, I could have dashed back to base or how someone at 300 trophies doesn't understand auto attack with DynaMike doesn't fucking work if you're being chased
---
That‚Äôs Tick‚Äôs air strike missile
---
Gene shouldn‚Äôt have pulled a Piper with her super. Gene is the bad random here. Especially because the Crow has 8 gems‚Äîdoing Gene‚Äôs job as gem carrier.
---
Search "lex brawl stars Android" on YouTube and click the first one. It's a brawl stars tutorial but it should work for rush wars as well. At least that's what I'm gonna try
---
Actually I think the Shellys are mostly tanking while Piper is simply dodging rockets and snipe. Tho I‚Äôm surprised that it‚Äôs not even Enraged yet. GG

YES! YES! YES! YES!

14k no legendaries, it's getting kinda boring

Why is Ryan still wearing summers clothes?

You do if you want to download it in beta.

Guys, I'm shaking. I'm fucking shaking. I never wanted to breed with anyone more than I want to with Bibi . That perfect, curvy body. Those funny words. The child bearing hips of a literal high effort meme. It honestly fucking hurts knowing that I'll never mate with Bibi, pass my genes through it, and have him birth a set of perfect offspring. I'd do fucking ANYTHING for the chance to get Bibi pregnant. A N Y T H I N G. And the fact that I can't is quite honestly too much to fucking bear. Why would you create something so perfect? To fucking tantalize me? Fucking laugh in my face?! Honestly guys, I just fuck

Gene had 2 gems, Crow has 8. The only expendable person on blue team was Spike. Gene death = reset countdown. Gene was def trying to get rid of her, but a Gene should never pull a Piper who has her Super. That‚Äôs like pulling a Bull.

Congrats, finished 15k today

I have always used the jumppad to launch the head after I discovered it would stay long enough for it to get launched, but I've never had this happen to me before.

He‚Äôs talking about the trophies

Keep it on r/RushWars
---
Hey! I've seen this video before...
---
Ok, so I have Leon on my main acc.(TripX)
---
And I have Crow on my second acc(i think the name is DaCheezyBoi)
---
Holup
---
Honestly that‚Äôs not what a report button is for, I don‚Äôt think he did that on purpose he just made a mistake
---
I can't even do this because i do not have dynamike maxed.... :(
---
Frank and El Primo have the Fastest reload and Tick have the slowest
---
The ike can shoot you while in bush
---
Shelly use rates have gone up by 70%!
---
Well, they wont add this mostly because of all the fake reports
---
Just make every Skin with
---
Custom Brawler Model only
---
30 gems
---
So we back into bush
---
We need a Leon Ninja outfit that throw shurikens
---
why i got CoC CR and BS combined vibes?
---
What are you favorite maps and modes ? 
---
As for me, I love new maps, especially in Heist.
---
I did it with a power 5 brawler, idk maybe you suck or maybe it‚Äôs your teammates.
---
Can someone please start r/ryangang
---
So is that your main account now? Lol
---
Just wait until this post gets 444 upvotes

Remove the 1 tile stone in the mid an than its is fine

Nice indeed.
---
Out of the things that could be introduced, there coul be a bot that allows you to link your Reddit account to your Brawl Stars account and link your flair to your trophy count. 
---
Hard to do but with some research and coding it‚Äôs possible. I could give a shot at it.
---
Wait, what do you mean by there's no teammates in sd? Just now i got killed by a team of 5 people lol
---
Similar thing happened to me. I played with a Bo in gem grab. The game was close and we lost. So I clicked play again so we could redeem ourselves.  Only the Bo clicked play again. We got destroyed the next game. After the game, I checked their profile and it said they had 3000+ 3v3 victories, but their trophy count was in the 6000's. None of their brawlers looked tilted, so I can only assume they were a bot, or just a really bad player.
---
Really?
---
Yeah boi!
---
Yeah, no might as well play cr or coc or bb
---
Your forgot the bandaid friend
---
Haha
---
Edit: yeah

Cool, now all the babies can stop crying for a new brawl talk.

1 seccond passed

This is very underrated.

I blame that Rico super at the end

Supercell is trying to make their own end games here...
---
^(they really don't)

Tanks are actually faster than snipers. Being slow would make them really bad cause they need to get close to other brawlers

He probably photoshopped those pictures

this is stolen, you can still see the fucking watermark at sakura spike

5.0001 milliseconds after new update: WHerE iS BRAwl TalK!?!?!

Yah. It take 3 days editing a 2 Minute video...

You state your opinion like it's fact, that's what I call ignorant.

Only legends will remember

How do you even know if rush wars will be any good... I may be able to understand a post like this after it is released but you have no idea how it will turn out.
---
Oh no! He's hot!
---
Yes, it is sad but not OG, it happened only a few months ago. It happened a while after global soooo..

He said they were getting ready, so by now it has probably been filmed, and gonna be uploaded tomorrow on the same day as the new game is coming out.

But the world IS Buning, meanwhile nobody is doing a fucking thing to stop global warming

yikes this is the second time this has happened to me lol i dont get the joke
---
Not lucky because it‚Äôs bad. Carl with Pam is the best way to go.
---
I have over 15k and the other day I got matched with a jessie with 600 total trophies...
---
They are around the center
---
You are the king of luck broüòÅüëçüèΩ
---
Well it's not a teaser as much as it is someone in a piper costume, but still, hopefully it's somewhat of a tease.
---
No, like- why wouldn't they release it? They could've made that a skin..
---
Bruh. I've seen BS memes before. This ain't the first, and it ain't the best
---
There is watermark. You stole it!
---
I only need spike
---
There‚Äôs a reason why it has the ‚Äòhumor‚Äô flair
---
That's the same thing here but not that bad
---
oh

spike aint bad

I died instantly the whole match

For insane IV, it definitely is

I have experience with that, and agree.

300 gems = $20

Tough to upvote someone who asks for upvotes. It‚Äôs like ‚Äúoh I was gonna do that on my own accord, but now I‚Äôm just obliging someone‚Äôs demands.

Just like here, cause I forgot to put his name on the meme, how was it, are you happy, just credit bratu if you wanted, if all my upvote goes here then I delete my old Fucking one, sorry
---
They aren‚Äôt gonna nerf it. They are going to Ree balance it. Bc bo‚Äôs super isn‚Äôt as powerful as a source of damage in high level, because pros know where the mines are. The star power will be useless with a nerf. Maybe knock back and a stun:

I have lost in Insane II against the boss twice now where the game ended as the boss was 1%. I feel like if I had Colt's 2nd star power perhaps that little change in DPS could have made the end different.

My idea to make both Gene's star powers good
---
Magic Puffs: Since MP is not a star power made to be used in solo, like Da Capo, my idea to make Magic Puffs goods is increase his heal to 400, like Pam's super, this star power would be very used in 3v3s, but useless on solo.
---
Pat on the Back: This is the worst star power ever made, this star power is also useless on solo, to make him relevant, is make the super Heal Gene when he hits a opponent, that would be a very good solo SP for Gene.
---
*ahem*
---
Maybe. He needs that second job to pay for the healthcare WWE doesn't provide.
---
Bro, I think you‚Äôre wrong there. It never takes them much time to edit it after they‚Äôve recorded it. My guess is that it‚Äôs gonna be tomorrow.
---
But officer you see üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è i dont have a keyboard
---
He needs

Not really. Yes it‚Äôs easier to get trophies but the max amount of trophies you can have that don‚Äôt get reset on the season end hasn‚Äôt changed. It‚Äôs more like 14k before the update is now 16k-17k. The trophy ranges under the season reset (13.5k as of now) didn‚Äôt get effected that much. Maybe a 1000 trophy increase. It‚Äôs only the higher ranks that have had such massive boosts. Now having a high total trophy value is more indicative of how much time you have rather than how skilled you are.
---
A little backstory to this skin idea:
---
Hence Tara is my favourite Brawler, I somehow came up with this while being on a walk through a forest. Tara has a weapon that usually isn't really physically dangerous to humans - tarot cards - so I find leafs fitting for this skin.
---
What maybe looks like an onion on her head was intended to be a purple flower bud instead of her purple hair at that point. The eye on her forehead represents a flower, so I chose yellow for its iris.
---
The three golden rings she wears on each arm got replaced through flowery armrings, a liana ring is wrapped around her elbows.
---
And for her pants and shoes, you need a little fantasy - while I wanted to make her trousers look like bark, Tara's blue shoes are inspired from water. So the black lines and seemingly "cracks" on her dark-brown trousers shall remember you of a tree, and the lines on her shoes metaphorically are the trees roots.

Thank you for reading.. ! =)

yesterday at the last second I did a trick shot, it was going to go in but time ran out. The same game I also did another trickshot, stopped right in front of the goal and didn't go in.
---
well when golden rico bacame expensive they also didn't aks the players who had him before for extra gems so
---
But even without Frank‚Äôs star power, his health is the same as El Primo‚Äôs. So Frank has more.
---
69 updoots now
---
This needs more upvotes
---
I don‚Äôt mind playing with randoms. Most of em are actually good if u can get a good comp. but how do I get matched with a 200 Jessie when I‚Äôm above 700 trophies...

Even deleting the forced personal break?

It's painful losing a game of Uno. It's even more painful when their last card was a Plus 4.

You can get up to 12 gems per drop. I‚Äôm assuming you opened a big or mega box and got 2 drops with 3 gems and 1 drop with 8 gems.
---
So funmy
---
**Boiii**
---
No, she clearly didn't. In her position, it would have been extremely easy to sandwich the opposing three brawlers with her teammates. Ffs the Poco spent a good 40% of the time on the other side of the map which shows how much pressure the Rico and Poco were able to put. That Shelly was garbage. OP's sarcasm may have been hard to read the first couple of seconds where the Shelly wasn't AFK but it became obvious soon after. She even get bush revealed by the Gene who appeared to be bush checking when she could have easily hid. Those types of players deserve to get banned from playing a certain character for a certain time period. This clip isn't even that bad, though, it's even worse in Bounty maps where Shelly is viable.
---
im really feeling it!
---
I opened a mega box but that was nuts
---
Yeah but there they made a 30 gems skin into a 150 gems so players should be' happy if they make a 80 into a 30 then that would be a problem lol
---
üòå that took me a few tries not gonna lie
---
well frank has a really good super mechanic too, when you hit someone you get the super back instantly, if you don't two hit them (except those fucking randoms kill the stunned enemies too fast like wtf do you think I need help at attacking two fucking times)
---
Lol check your math bud. I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs 3 months in between June 26 and August 26. It‚Äôs 2, minus 1 month that leaves 1 month to work.
---
trophyie
---
I'm 13k player and still not have Gene(((
---
I can tell
---
It looks like an aetstyle familiar, not saying you stole this but I've seem this type of style only once before.
---
Gamers whomst do not play with the stacking draw 4 rule are simply not epic enough to play uno
---
Everyone should keep their expectations low. They‚Äôve had a month to work so we should expect star points changes and balance changes. MAYBE a new brawler, no more. We should have a bigger update in like 3 or 4 months (club wars I hope).
---
Ohmaigudo
---
Imagine caring about someone g
---
They also have released many games in the past that never even came out global
---
Okay, I can see the sarcasm here.
---
I mean, I know the Star-swap bug exists and how it works.

And that one person, would be me

good thing he doesnt flex leon (his icon is barley)

Cause all brawler in there portraits come from that side so it is either have Tara like that or have one brawler out of all 27 just randomly enter from the other side.

Piper is only good on few maps (3 I think) the rest is just shellys (6 out of 10 most of the times).

How did you get leon before penny or rico?
---
You are welcome :)
---
I thought you were joking at the first paragraph but i was wrong -.-
---
Leon?
---
13*
---
Shit now I have to draw another
---
What about counters? In 1v1 isnt gonna be fair if for example you‚Äôre Dynamike and get paired up with a Mortis
---
i dont get it
---
I got Leon and Frank from a big box
---
I think a fox would be 3 lives for everyone and last team alive wins so it should be more like a 4v4 mode
---
Sure friend :)

‚ÄúThis ain‚Äôt my first rodeo.‚Äù

Consider yourself lucky then, I wish I was like you! Just today I've had 3 games like that in a matter of 30 minutes, it's terribly frustrating.

---
Lmao
---
Once you learn to use him in bb you are good to go
---
Do you understand a joke
---
I actually made the list which is currently in my pc.
---
So lemme explain you the situation, I made the list where every set has its own brawler so One was where it was infact Mortis and dynamike but there was a third brawler than countered mortis but didnt counter dynamike so the list is like Rock paper siccors thing either you get lucky with you brawlers choice and could easily win or not be lucky and need good skills to win over your opponent who chose the brawler that can counter yours
---
I think with the release of RW, we will get a RW skin in BS
---
isnt this a glitch?
---
Well let‚Äôs be honest would you use tick on a map like that and go straight middle?
---
Yeah I dont really understand those guys too. They‚Äôre just seeing downvotes so you must be a bad guy
---
Over used
---
Pretty cool map...well done :)

Trophy road? What about trophy road? Did they say they'd change anything about it? I just heard they were going to do some stuff to star points. Also happy cake day

Is this a movie? Pls tell me the name of this film
---
I thought piper had the slowest reload
---
I cant decide between poco and leon
---
wait what'd he say?
---
Yes he is amazing in the right hands but his usefulness is limited by the amount of walls on the map.
---
What I get is a 6k player with 600 Shelly playing with his friend who is a 500 trophy player playing a 10 trophy Poco and then they brawl ball with one random that is me of course and I am at 15.5k. This should not be allowed imo. Idk if this is your case but it happens so often to me. Just some dumb randoms who think it is a good idea to play with their 500 total trophy friend at hight trophies.
---
His part is invisible
---
Very well I will try to make a Poco art tomorrow

Heh, i found this funny

And also add carls pickaxe in your picture

That is what we are hoping!

oh alright, amazing concept nonetheless!
---
Nice repost btw
---
Sorry to appoint you snapy sniping doesnt work with frank and some specific brawlers
---
How do you know brawl talk is coming? Didn't found no msg about it through so many memes and stuff...
---
Clash of clans is popular despite having a long and slow progression system because it‚Äôs progression is enjoyable. You unlock new troops and spells with each townhall. Each building and troop upgrade gives a new skin to how they look. 
---
In brawl stars progression is not enjoyable . There‚Äôs nothing that you gain from upgrading your brawlers from levels 1-9 other than regular stat increases . So the only way to get anything new is to get a brawler‚Äôs star powers.
---
When I get any brawler only my legy chances go down
---
I made one exactly like this but I said star points instead of power points and someone pointed it out so I fixed it
---
Ive been using this strat since his release, now everyone will know
---
Oh right thx
---
Then at least fix your supercell matchmaking!!!
---
the piper remodel is a joke that dani and ryan made a video and frank said this piper remodel is sick. maybe he is teasing us or just kidding. the brawler idk honestly but frank said the update gonna be ‚Äúpurple‚Äù so it may be an epic let‚Äôs just wait and see
---
Yes.
---
You should gone for the super
---
Frank stops to  perform his attack or his super with his medium range.  
---
Tick can perform his attack over walls while moving.
---
I was joking about the brawler but the remodel was confirmed by frank...
---
E onde tem n√©
---
For pain and for glory
---
It's just Spike's second star power swapped with Piper.
---
When I get Dynamike to Power 10 I'll remember this
---
Impossible you can‚Äôt play the game without updating it
---
Your average anime 7 year old.
---
What do you mean?
---
They went on vacation for a month, meaning that there is no brawler for July, and they had to start on this next update in August so most likely it will release in the next few weeks
---
Hopefully they make good changes for star points. I‚Äôm @ 6k star points.
---
Ok calm down
---
OWO
---
I think his first star power is better
---
Wtf jjajaja ja XD
---
He is not game leader

where is pipers umbrella ? *looks around* i still dont se- ITS COMING OUT OF HIS WHAT NOW ?!?!?!?!?

CRITICISM
---
guys im shaking , i have sugar in my pocket ,     
---
MOMMMMMMMMMMMMMM PICK ME UP IM SCARED
---
i think stalling would be a major problem: primo can‚Äôt beat a shelly, but he can outrun her and just keep running. In bounty this is fixed by having a star in the middle, but how do you motivate two players to attack each other even if they‚Äôre at a disadvantage.
---
I would totally run away from someone if i can save 8 trophies that way. 
---
How do you beat someone with a longer range?
---
If they‚Äôre getting gems, bolts or whatever you can make plays, but how do you attack a piper when you‚Äôre a gene and they have no reason to get closer to you, or let you get closer? 
---
Both being the same brawler would result in boring games and not being the same brawler is unfair and boring in most cases too.
---
piper vs piper would be cool tho, other than that, don‚Äôt think this will happen, and there are more reasons than this one that it wont happen.
---
brawl stars‚Äô games are not about getting kills (except for maybe showdown, and look how well people stick to the objective of killing everyone and not teaming there) with good reason.
---
Better to play with friends. At least for now.
---
What am I suppose to do with that
---
Nao tem br
---
Lol
---
No the barley and piper has lowest trophies and lower power level and the penny has higher trophies and higher power level so I don‚Äôt understand what u are talking about??
---
Nononono I premade a list so everything should be like rock, paper, scissors scenario. For example Shelly counters Nita, Nita counters Colt, Colt counters Shelly.
---
Yes! I was waiting for someone with this idea.
---
So you would have just ignored that one hit from death gene with 3 gems literally next to you and wouldn't have attacked him?
---
this Monday or next one?
---
Tick+Snare A Bear
---
Y‚Äòknow elite players
---
UMMMM sorry buttt HOW IN THE WORLD DOES HE HAVE 764 TROPHIES IF EVERY BRAWLER HAS 0 TROPHIES EXELT LEON WITH 8 TROPHIES
---
How'd you land that job?
---
Maybe only 10 second downtime between rounds.
---
3 gems is not worth going that deep into their spawn while someone's respawning and suiciding. You had great middle control, you gave them the game.
---
Throwers are gonna be a little too strong
---
Ok didn't know they already made one
---
Thanks, man! I put the link to my map in my main comment; the website is called PixelCrux. It *may* have an app, but I'm unsure.
---
Damn this is so sad... i hope my pals doesnt desapear like that, please tell to is if re re-apear.
---
Not that there‚Äôs anything wrong with that
---
I‚Äôm shaking
---
I think it happens because you hit all 4 bots at once, which instantly recharges your super. It‚Äôs weird, though, that you can super again by attacking.
---
i checked your profile, cant find it, im too tired maybe to see where to look, link me?
---
Curveball Piper
---
I saw that clash royale had 15 seconds also to choose 1 card from 8 in draft so i think its already perfect
---
Is that ricochet
---
range.
---
Hahahha LMAO
---
NERFFFFF
---
Ok, i was worried there would be bandaid shellys running around
---
No, only Canada, Australia and New Zealand
---
Sry i have it in my pc for just in case Ima go and edit the post real quick and add them in
---
Yes finally I‚Äôve be waiting on brawl talk
---
I have not seen a single guy on any subreddit besides boom beach that likes boom beach
---
Talk about bias. You haven't seen a single second of gameplay. You've seen a single screenshot (from pre-beta as well) and you've decided the game looks like crap. Ok sir.
---
Just a heads up this post took us a week to make so before even starting on the text we obviously went through every problem we could think of and tried to make this as fair as possible!
---
This was not my question, thanks captain obvious now I also know that it was a fucking stupid idea. If I did escape it probably saved the game cause guess what 3v2, do you think you can keep control for 6 gems? My questiom was would you not have done it? Knowing that in a 3v2 you probably can't hold control for a decent ammount of time anyway and it would be an almost guranteed win if you managed to escape, would you have not done it?
---
That‚Äôs Low plus u have bandaid
---
I can't stop laughing HeLP!
