But then why does it damage other barley s
---
Cool
---
His voice lines are:
---

---
I almost died
---
gone wrong
---
not clickbait
---
OMG I got this one cool thing
---
chess
---
Every time mortis kills an enemy he recovers one bar of reload
---
Nice job
---
That would be cool, like the bubble pops.
---
white crow needs more white cloths
---
Excellent job as always, just an idea but a spartan Carl riding a horse (mariokart style) car would look awesome
---
I’m not sure if they are siblings, if not I ship this. If they are then a good family moment lol
---
stop flexing on me by knowing how to draw hands
---
I sMElL a RAt
---
Not me, but AWWWWW YEEEEAH! Awesome AGAIN! How do you come up with these things?
---
Seriously, Colt needs a better star power, or buff his current one
---
funny how when the community provides actual feedback he doesn't respond but someone says 1 curse word and he feels the need to block... yea great community management btw if he really cared he would respond in a nice way and try to come to an understanding but with supercell $ is the bottom line its sad because in early development the game sees many improvements because they're needed to launch the game then after that they can push out bad updates just with purchasable content to help their bottom line its sad but its the gaming world we are all in right now
---
Yea kinda looks like you traced it. It’s pixel for pixel the same as the in game image.
---
At least TRY and make it look like you drew it
---
Those were shibas you uneducated potato
---
RASENSHURIKEN!
---
canadian currency and us currency both $. you are likely using us currency
---
Try to take my gems? BEGONE!
---
What?
---
yooo wtf. These are so good
---
Unless you're they are darryls. Then we can both take out the dynamikes.
---
Because it is. It’s printed and then traced. OP is fooling nobody
---
Bibis Star power should be that a charged shot shoots projectiles back at enemies when her home run bat is full. Takes skill and would be fun to hit piper shots or supers back.
---
Cool! You're still food for me though....
---
It really annoys me when my teammates don’t know how to dodge
---
Yes, but it benefits the original creator more than the reposter
---
At least he took it seriously
---
ok. i see your point. but shelly is O K as a starter brawler and i feel like she is balanced as a starter brawler
---
but i just don't get why you get so angry every time someone says shelly is overpowered
---
Thats got to be the best pirate I’ve ever seen.
---
Oooh yah!
---
# DARRYL
---
Eseehc
---
tbh, she's op as a starter brawler, but her viability spikes as you increase in trophies
---
nice fake bro!
---
It's a JUTSU from Naruto. Cause this map looks like that JUTSU you uncultered swine.
---
you said supercell instead of brawl stars
---
did you have a stroke?
---
when penny shoots her cannon, it will fire coins that spead out when it comes into contact with brawlers
---
Because I’m good at it
---
Anyone who is trying to watch this video
---
Not gonna lie took me a minute to realize
---
how

#dontstopthespin
---
Thx :3
---
This is a good tier list. Well done. I like that you depict how easy / hard a brawler can be used by someone new.
---
Please give feedback
---
This is awesome.
---
*Pam wanna know your location*
---
Lol ik
---
I thought it was lag
---
No You
---
but shelly has very low damage and her health is just too mediocre to actually pressure the enemy
---
Isn’t he learning 3d modeling though for this reason? I think I saw a post about this a while back.
---
Sorry it went right over my head.
---
Her star power ia trash, but somehow annoying.
---
I like it but maybe add some gaps in the long walls otherwise love it👌👍
---
Not sure why but this made me smile 😆
---
The Darryl!🤣🤣🤣🎧
---
she is weak in snake prarie, and you got showdown and brawl ball switched tbh.
---
Mortar penny is smart than Rondom *change my mind*
---
This is most likely. If I saw ANYONE with an energy drink I’d run away Mach 1.
---
So far you have been the only not extremely critical comment 👌
---
family friendly i like it
---
For a second, i thought u were referencing...........someone else
---
I know
---
“its just a hat” this is treason
---
This is why we need report button
---
OMG THIS IS SO ADORABLE....WOW ITS SO COOL
---
What’s an overview mirror?
---
Mirror match
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
you guys are legends
---
nice
---
Spike doesn't need a buff, poco does
---
The poco didnt do anything though
---
I don’t main anyone, and Nita is S tier. So is Carl. Otherwise pretty dead on.
---
kills per season, you get a reward based on the number of killls in that season
---
Would upvote but it’s at 666
---
Personally for me it depends on the situation, against a bunch of shotgun characters where nitas bear won't last more than a few seconds keeps her from being and S, considering how good it is in most other circumstances
---
You mean 9?
---
I have the Leon's flair and I want more throwers 😉
---
 you should manually aim darryl and primo imo
---
**electroballs**
---
No...
---
i downvote to keep 666
---
With that team comp, I’d have given up too. Do not bring poco to siege unless you have a premade team.
---
This thread is getting toxic pretty quick...
---
BRO COME ON!!!
---
could be tilting on purpose
---
Same...
---
He took being lazy seriously, now that’s just ironic
---
That’s exactly what he’s doing lol
---
wow you said n#### very edgy
---
Just buff everyone except for crow
---
and i as well
---
Mom come pick me up I’m scared
---
Gitched Piper Shots/ Siege Mode
---
[GIF of proof](https://imgur.com/a/IbpgB9O)
---
3 out of 4 of the Piper's shot did not register on the enemy's IKE. All of the were fired from the same distance and their animation all touched the IKE. Only the first shot was registered with 2696 damage, the rest were ignored. Caused us the game. Hate to think of how many times my shots were not registered in other matches but I did not notice.
---
Device : Samsung A7
---
Account Code :  #RJ9VLP9L
---
This is a good idea. Supercell, please!
---
Nope. I crashed it into a mercedes
---
i dont think because nestor is a spanish name and the only other spanish on the enemy player was carlos moreno which he was 280 trophies
---
That nibba Darryl said: "➡️➡️🔄🔄🔄➡️➡️"
---
Go to r/brawlrecruit
---
When people name themselves Bot 1:
---
OMG I am so smart people will think I am a bot but I'm really not omg i am 98999 iq like the youtube videos omg not clickbait I almost died
---
Rank 5?
---
Spike throws a frag that can go around walls if needed and his super just goes wherever brock yeah except hes shooting over the wall tara is a hoodini i mean someone like shelly and barley combine... Like has a gun and then throws like a frag over ya know what im saying?
---
Pretty sure it's to prevent people from ganging up on YouTubers when they play sd
---
How are people making these skin ideas? They all have something in common, maybe the software used. But good job!

Why should he care with this? If you don't wanna see this, just scroll down.
---
he has that exclusive skin so yes
---
A 700 damage that has infinite range is way too op just imagine sniping the heist and seige boxses/turrets from a whole screen away... way too OP also the super is kind of useless.
---
Oh ho! Then come as close as you’d like!
---
#**Yey**
---
Its a good idea but some star power on your list is too overpowered and some is too useless. And taras second shadow is in real battle impossible.
---
usually some bo’s will stand their own mines for protection so this tactic is pretty gud
---
Léon and crow am I a joke to u
---
Dudebro draws a picture and people are calling out a witch hunt lol... just play the damn game.
---
💪💪💪💪👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
---
You had Skunkseaman on you side, he does all those amazing trick shots in brawl Ball
---
So clutch vs that crow wp
---
Instead of bull it should be primo
---
how adorable
---
Go to social and when  you have the screen where all the members are listed click on the one you want to promote hit profile and you will see a setting scroll looking thing hit that and then hit promote.
---
I don't get it
---
It sux especially when you trying to get an easy and spam all you attacks a stupid edge of a wall 
---
.
---
Go to social, club, tap on name, it should say “promote”
---
Crow:
---
Radioactive: Brawlers nicked by his poison will not be able to stay near their teammates temporarily or they will poison their teammates.  The area of effect can also burn out bushes if there for to long.
---
Life Drain: Brawlers nicked by his poison will give crow health with every poison hit.
---
Danger Daggers: Poison is stackable up to 10 hits
---
Long-Term Effect: Brawlers continuously getting hit by crow’s daggers will change with every hit. 1-3 hits is regular poison, 4-5 hits will slow the player down, and after 6 hits, the player will lose one ammo bar. The slow effect should not be as slow as spike’s super. The long term effect will stop after poison is gone.
---
BECAUSE SUPERCELL SAID LIKE THAT, THEY SAID EVERYONE NEEDS A REMODEL AND THEY DO WHAT DO YOU DONT UNDERSTAND...Somebody please explain this guy how that goes...I tried but he STILL doesnt understand...Like they did with rico, shelly, bull, barley, brock etc. They remodeled them and their skins, so now they need to remodel crow (because they said that hes one of the brawlers that needs a remodel) and also remodel his skins and tara for example needs a remodel first before the skins because it will be easier to make them after the remodel.
---
They r bots
---
Do you mean SkOnk is mad because his peers outshine him? (sorry i dont fully understand what u were saying)
---
It's cool but space out some of the bushes to make it have more options for strategies besides shelly or bull
---
You are dense.
---
You really should tag it as a strategy
---
She’s 15
---
Gotta train those randoms until they are not randoms anymore, but is there like an infinite supply of randoms. How can I not find one decent player randomly
---
Yeah bro, me too..I like her how she is now too...For example look at rico, they ruined my boy 😭. I really want other brawler not to get a remodel but hey, supercell said they need one...Im just hoping they dont ruin them like they did with rico...
---
Best comment this post will ever have (probably the only but shut up)
---
Damn playing on mobile that’s kinda cringe bro just fork out the 20$ for PC or console
---
hehehe ^69
---
This is so cute
---
I never begged for them, I just said I need upvotes to know whether if I should do this again. No need to make a meme if no one notices it
---
im pretty sure it still does

Give me the meme and ill edit it lol...

I think that lamp genes are supposed to be from the egyptian folclore and royalty used to have those kind of things on their eyes...I think...
---
You mean the motherfuckers who gets 10 gems and run into enemy base, I know them. Or the retarded bulls who only have two gems but stay in bush doing nothing because "bulls surprise with bush"
---
Wow, pretty good meme desing kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk,
---
but bro how can el primo be hardest to master than Pam, Leon and Penny? And why is poco on the hard side when he is the easiest brawler to play on the game? Also i see Dinamike as an easy-medium brawler to play like on the second lvl on the meme.
---
dyna is the hardest character in the game to master lol
---
As per the video, not if she gets two in one.
---
Face, shoes, nose mouth, hats?
---
Shelly: Frozen Weakness - when shelly used her super to enemies, enemies damage decreas -%10 for 6 seconds.
---
Piper is a lot easier than Brock, wym man
---
I want to add a star power for leon in which he could disappear for 20 seconds.
---
I hate those random tier lists and when you give your opinion in the comments saying 'hey stop making random stories with a tier list' then everyone will downvote you this the kind of tier list i wanted
---
I mean, that's one way to use it
---
Dude.... Frank... he..... he needs a nerf on how long the super stuns enemies to start it off then
---
Then a nerf to reload speed and how fast his attacks come out but BUFFING HIM he would literally be another Rosa so... I say he just needs 2 nerfs and then he is good
---
Who cares? This doesn’t relate to the OP at all
---
Thinking outside of the box
---
Colt: super boost - whenever colt uses his super he gets an attack and movement speed boost for 11.5 seconds
---
...Smoking hot :-) Nice.
---
Thanks for the reference
---
I hit 700 Leon on showdown xd

Back in 2016 (idk about now) people would spam the laughing king emote and the crying king emote when they won or were winning. 
---
supercell added an emote limit to stop the spam but ppl would just save their limit until the end of the game to spam. 
---
Then Supercell added a mute button but it was too boring without emotes. 
---
It was the existence of emotes that caused all of this, and they shouldn’t add them to BS to avoid all of that.

Yeah it's a mobile game have to keep it casual for the money. The whole mobile game ecosystem sucks for gamers great for business. They also need to do something about the dude that throws aoe potions... A lot of people don't know how to use him right. Everytime I see one on my team it's a guarantee loss
---
Find a team. Know when to stop playing.
---
If you're not getting trophies from wins it means you disconnected during the match and the bot took over.
---
Super should be a beach ball
---
If they would add it on trophy road i would love it (instead of gold and powerpoints)
---
That is true
---
I’m also working on her and i grind greatly
---
Was a live game with 640+ viewers that's why everyone was spinning x_x
---
Their existence caused the toxicity. They let players express their toxicity.
---
In all seriousness though, short range brawlers would struggle on the outside of this map and even more so in the very centre.
---
this is really good!
---
They should really nerf penny’s range or increase the ike’s range.
---
It was fan concept for gene
---
Well me and my mates were never bothered by them at all, don’t understand why anyone would be offended by a laughing cartoon king
---

Hahaha you are just a fucking shitstain I play for fun with my girlfriend but hey! I’m so proud of you I bet your mom is too! I have 10k my girl has 5k now move along dick rider! I never said I was a god at the game I just had fun playing against Ash and had no clue about your shitty band mates😂😂😂 or your shitty club that you’re only in because you’re a dick riding introvert.
---
Best example from CR: you lose a game, the enemy spams the angry/cry emote. Doesn’t matter If you get mad or not, it is toxic behaviour, and no game should allow this in my oppinion. Emotes could be fun, but there will always be people who use it wrong. I loved it in CR when i could “communicate” with the opponent in good manner, but it wasn’t that much fun when it was all about to BM the other.
---
Someone who plays for fun doesn’t have 3 accounts you absolute idiot, that’s what you call an absolute no life!
---
I meant more than 10 gems.
---
Nope I’m not even  in their band lol. Idk these guys but I can still see how you got carried
---
Wait. That's illegal.
---
If im the opponent, i would had rage so badly in completely fml
---
Wow what a savage! “Irrelevant” you say? Look at you, do you have anything impressive to show off? Nope. And it seems like I’ve touched a nerve
---
Nice!
---
Does this mean how difficult is to play with the bs characters?
---
Very great idea
---
what the... I'm not gonna even talk about it...
---
barley is good on that map ‘cause he can kill brawlers in other lanes, control the main one and deal a lot of damage to the safe while the enemies are separated, idk what the heck op’s talking about
---
Wow, congratulations for defeating the top players bro, there aren't many players in the world who can defeat them
---
But how are their names visible during game-time?  Is it a replay or a friendly match?
---
well done!!
---
Lol do you need to talk to someone kid?
---
No one beats the....!
---
The names are always visible but yes it’s a replay thank you 🙏
---
yes lol me too
---
i wood be SOOOOO surprised

How?

---
This is sooo me check my posts
---
Thank you for your contribution to society. You will be remembered as a great man.
---
The joke is the enemy had a Piper and Mortis on their team, and I didn’t realize that we were that close
---
ah yes the map where everyone suddenly turns into a dodging master
---
Wow your insults are so original
---
That’s exactly what I thought
---
Croew
---
Wow
---
yes
---
Me too
---
That's a positive trophy trade
---
Well piper isn’t all that powerful in the first place, plus this is only powerful if you can actually land shots which is relatively difficult.
---
They are just happily revealing their skill level
---
Bots are much more dangerous than most people.
---
He's not a high skill capped brawler, he's too weak and powerless so that's why they're selling him
---
+7 -6 isn’t neutral, it’s positive
---
Awesome. Gotta love the hat☺

wait thats illegal

In practice Fortnite in Brawl Stars

Omg they killed tara, you bastards

According to my recearch , gamers who name themselves bot 1 are more likely to team.( kinda works)
---
Wtf I once got 12 gems from a regular box twice in a row, the same day I got Darryl and Frank from regular boxes and Mortis from a Mega box
---
I was at 1400, and I got my first legendary at 5150
---
Yummy powercube

YES! Keep up the excellent work man, this is gold
---
Somehow always happens when youre chased by a rosa with 11 power cubes and an energy drink in feast and famine

Nice repost
---
My man is so pathetic he his being overly toxic over VIRTUAL POINTS ON A MOBILE GAME OMEGALUL
---
Yes but it’s like calling a donut a cake. It’s quicker to say but everyone thinks your crazy
---
I’m talking about shots on the Ike you peanut brain
---
I want emotes, but not in the way a lot of other way want them. If emotes were added, they would only be seen by your teammates; stuff like "Pass!" would be available to use in Brawl Ball, "I'll carry the gems!" in Gem Grab, etc. After all, many modes are team-centric.
---
This is made by Same creator who made bibi art work.....
---
She's having a mental breakdown
---
Yeahh! Go ahead!
---
Wdym, they’re the ones that you would classify as ‘skilful’, they’re not the only ones I’ve pushed to 600... there’s also Bo, Carl, Brock, Poco and Nita
---
It was a really fun game seriously up until the last second I thought you guys had us!
---
this is what it SHOULD be
---
Turn guitar into guitar case and call him Don Poco. =P
---
Loool I’ve tried to do this by hiding in enemy base and died
---
Penny's star power should be if the cannon hits an enemy, the projectile bounces to another nearby enemy as well.  
---
OR  
---
Penny's splash damage now has additional damage over time. So if you hit an enemy and the enemy behind as well, they get additional damage over time.  
---
Colt's star power makes it so you can rotate while using his super. (It doesn't just shoot in a straight line)
---
Its alright
---
 XD
---
r/itwasagraveyardgraph
---
Good thing we can report.
---
Get the fuck out, dumbass
---
Or Penny's turret has a timer like bibis home run and whenever the timer gets full you can break your bag on the turret and it releases the barrage of bombs. The timer shouldnt be as fast as bibis.
---
I HATE U!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
Colt's super needs to have a new star power. 
---
New idea : Slick Hair
---
Colt's Looks reduce his opponents speed (shelly star reduction) and damage (-15% damage)  when the opponents are within 5 tiles owing to his perfect hair.
---
We cant reed the words but I get a good idea of what they do by the pics and the names, good job
---
Damn those genes
---
Campers
---
You spent 16% of your last 6 months playing Brawl Stars and 14% in Reddit. Effectively spending 30% of your last 6 months in Brawl and memes
---
My 5 year old got spike at 700 trophies lol
---
It would be so awesome if the extra charge on Bibi's bat would send out a ranged shot like the master sword when she's on full health!
---
For penny how about when her turret dies it explodes like a dynamike super
---
It's something you'll find on r/comedyhomicide
---
I got him yesterday and I never played with out the hat
---
Like I said you're unreliable smh
---
Oh bibi you so sexy,
---
If you would like to inform me of how bad I am shoot me a dm on discord #Jigsaw#5732
---
I support this message👍
---
Shelly: Frozen Weakness - when shelly used her super to enemies, enemies damage decrease -%10 for 2.5 seconds.
---
Nita : Thick Fur - When nita's bear gets heal by nita, Bears recieved damage decrease -%40 for 3 seconds.
---
Colt: Coward Speed - when colt's all of projectiles finished, colt moves much faster.
---
Bull : Leg Training - When bull's health decrease %40, bull moves %30 faster.
---
Jessies: Healthful and Stronger - If jessie heals her turret, turret gives +%10 more damage t enemies for 3 seconds.
---
Brock: Hot Hit - Burned enemies by fire gets 60 more damage per second.
---
Dynamike: Healthful Jumping - When dynamike jumped ovar a obstackle , dynamike gets +300 hp.
---
Bo: If bo sees an enemy in bush, enemy seem 4 more seconds to bo and bo's teammates.
---
If u love my ideas, I can write all of the brawlers :)
---
spinning is toxic enough. I wish I could turn off the screen that makes me watch the guy who killed me so I don’t have to watch him spit in my face
---
Yeah that’s what I was thinking cuz piper needs a buff anyways
---
Also, Poco's star power seems a little underwhelming (especially in showdown) so maybe add about 100 health to Poco for every shot  in addition to the 500 health he gives to allies
---
Agree. And their screen turn into Rosa slowly dying and saying "Mister Lazy, I don't feel so OP"
---
Hey! Could I use your clip in my Brawl Stars Highlights series? :) You would be properly credited in the video and in the description of the video. I won’t use the footage without your permission.

---
He didn’t make it
---
Well I mean they need to lag issues
---
Leon and Nita look similar 
---
Which means they're siblings
---
Which means that your name now makes sense
---
:D
---
Speedy thorns
---
Stfu
---
There’s a multitude of reasons not to add emotes
---
1. Randoms might spend the whole game spamming them instead of playing
---
2. There’s 6 players in brawl stars, 6 player spamming emotes would be chaos.
---
3. A rage-inducing game like brawl stars does not need a taunting method
---
4. Spamming emotes after a win is like kicking a man when he’s down. It’s one of the most cowardly things you can do.
---
I was adding on to the joke  why its big
---
Ikr
---
Accessible only for Dynamikes

[Based off of this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z47xwzYGop8)
---
And if they want to play rosa again,their phone fucking explodes
---
no.
---
Gg the frank stun on turret OP
---
Ok, guess noone knows how to use him well in Brawl Ball, whos under 11k, because I never saw one
---
WTF ? Speak clearly .
---
Your skins doesnt make any sense how would poco be a detective??
---
I didn't say he did, but the art is incredible. I would like to know the autor
---
Is it possible to learn this power
---
It’s very bland. It’s not very good against good teams either.
---
To be continued...
---
Woo woo
---
I have both Leon and Nita and when I Play as either one of them and see the opposite brawler (if I play with Nita then Leon, if I play with Leon then nita) I fiercely fight to the death to combat this stupid underage shipping trend
---
(caption) stolen art
---
I laughed so hard I screamed 😂🤣🤣😂😂😂😂
---
You could have but darryl was more epic
---
She not balanced if she has a blind spot in her attack range that makes her miss when she should clearly be landing an attack.  We will know if she's balanced or not after that's fixed.  But rn she does feel slow on her swing.  When you consider her swing being the same speed as Frank, but she hits for less, has less range, and less health she doesn't seem that good.  Her star power is good but again kind of mute when you do chase someone down only for your swing to not register.
---
But they can come to Mortis gang and gwt tips
---
but isnt it just a boulder
---
Ok
---
Mortis gang members who bought Mortis for 300+ gems: *D:&lt;*
---
 **Thanks**!  His name is Wanderer
---
Okay so this might be asking a lot but just wondering how much you'd charge for me to commission a Brawl Stars skin? Also I'm curious about your process for making these!
---
Thank you

I say ulti and call super the hability you get at level 10

Thanks lol

Рууууссские тут ура
---
Unless you dont play much you lyinf
---
What? I’m saying that it’s unfair for someone to win a fight just because they’re brawler is better a clicking a button. Aim should be taken into a count... autoaim is just stupid and promotes a bad play style while not allowing players to get better
---
ikr. that colt was just spamming autoaim whole game 🤦‍♀️
---
I can see the mouse
---
i felt that with Bibi, bitch you just pushed me far from you thanks now I can easily run from you
---
Me and the boys tryna find beans at 3am
---
That s a good drawning i can t wait for Crow
---
To be fair that also stands for any other tournament. In tennis or soccer, the first one out tends to have much less court time than the tournament champion.
---
souper
---
😉
---
How about you only see him when his attack does damage
---
I know , thats why the 1st word of the description is *NEW*
---
I like the idea of target practice. Would help with learning to lead your shots
---
Yup 500 upvotes for crow with colour
---
Hold my upvote
---
That’s nowhere near the same thing. If I come in last place in a soccer tournament I’m not going to lose anything, I just don’t get any trophies/titles.
---
Oh fuck
---
Lol.
---
Now, be honest, Who the heck aims with Shotgunners? Yes i understand that this is SOMETIMES unfair.
---
Soup is ready
---
Yeah just Super Saiyan Bibi them all and you'll eventually get 100.
---
nicebear no
---
It was a replay
---
I Play almost every day, i don't get much boxes because im F2P and i don't even have all the brawlers.
---
Looks like an amazing map visually, but not viable for gameplay.
---
That’s the problem... they should be aiming, because aiming is part of the game... I hope you understand that the issue is that people **should** be aiming with shotgunners and not that they are. If autoaim is removed, the average accuracy of people will end up still being pretty high since people **will learn how to aim**
---
Is this an Undertale Reference
---
Eh, I don't think that's a good comparison because a donut is a cake but donut is a more descriptive word for that specific type of cake. Ult vs super is just game specific lingo for the same thing.   
---
It's more like calling a can of pop a soda. Yeah people will understand what you mean by soda, but in this ~~game~~ area of the country we call it pop.
---
Дарова
---
That sounds reasonable 
---
When I’m on 3G I don’t lag but on WiFi it lags so much 
---
I have to sit literally 2mm away from my router for smooth gameplay
---
It’s all well and good until you realise Leon is going to chuck the bird in his mouth.
---
I am capped and I can't unlock Bibi. All my loot boxes are coin. Is this a bug?
---
Very kinda good
---
*Sweet sounds*
---
Flair doesn't check out
---
Yep, as intended, crows daggers are shot from the outside of his hit box, the daggers miss the bot because the daggers are thrown outside the red circle.
---
wait i got one for Crow (i think its op but hey everyone's complaining about Crow needing a buff so)
---
Crow : Extra Flight
---
For his Super, instead of just hitting the ground once, Crow bonces up and lands twice. It does reduced damage because lets be honest, if you have this star power, that means Crow is Maxed out, so he does loads of damage just by using his main attack.
---
Wish this happened to me more often. Usually my team mates are the noobs :(
---
If you say this is trash, [well this is my response to you](https://youtu.be/RYnFIRc0k6E?t=87)
---
then end it to 1:32
---
Thought I was the only one
---
LOL
---
Kill ur selve
---
Here are some ideas that would hopefully be not too broken and help balance out certain brawlers weaknesses:
---
Primo super causes an earthquake effect in a small radius when he lands, which does damage/reduces speed
---
Piper: echolocation: at max range, shot reveals enemies within 1 tile (shot must travel full distance without hitting something)
---
Bull: spiked boots: increased resistance to knock back and slow down effects
---
Nita: one with nature: extra damage to enemies standing in bushes
---
Crow: life link: crows poison gains him some amount of health back each tick
---
Spike: photosynthesis: super charges faster/stat boost when not in a bush (or maybe when near water)
---
Shelly: Locked and loaded: projectile travels faster when ammo bar is full
---
Tara: clear mind: stat boost when health bar is full
---
Frank: extra tough: increased health when ammo bar is full
---
Rico: bounce back: bullets can bounce off enemies as if they were walls too
---
Colt: lucky 7: one extra bullet per attack
---
Penny: cheap shot: firing main attack at the turret makes its next shot come faster
---
Pam: toxic beacon: Pam saps at the strength of nearby opponents when her super is ready
---
Leon: ambush: first attack out of super can go through enemies
---
Dynamite: light the fuse: deal a small amount of damage to very nearby enemies when using main attack
---
Barley: at your service: teammates reload faster when hit by barley attack
---
no seriously what does that last part mean
---
Cool so far that is 11 in total. Leon may be invisible cause I don't see him in the near future😂.
---
Yeah so make a new acc
---
On that new acc the offer will appear
---
I have the same one but with Gene
---
You didnt hear? It Pocos new buff!
---
It's ok, but not much tho
---
ok, i guess i'm never going to understand what you mean
---
[😂](https://emojipedia.org/face-with-tears-of-joy/)
---
i want a casual mode, ive been stuck at 9500 trophies for so long and i want to have a chill game
---
Detective Pocochu
---
Minecarts don’t even care who u are 😂
---
What the fuck have you brought to cursed land
---
Sorry I don't know then just search up screen recorder on Google play that's all I can say
---
I only did this once. I was playing a match (0-1) and suddenly started asking myself if i could score on my own goal. I lost a game like a f idiot
---
I thought brawl stars didn’t accept money from the pokemon games... guess I’m wrong
---
Nobody cares
---
Lvl1 mortis is total trash
---
At least you tried to help me. Thank you
---
Quality content
---
No. He wouldn’t. A rosa would be better because with her shield, she’d be able to take more damage than a frank could. Plus, you wouldn’t want frank because the goal of this is to have the robots fighting each other. Franks super would damage the robot, so the fight wouldn’t last as long
---
Try this https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.recorder.video.magic.capture.gameplay
---
...and then posts an empty piece of lined paper
---
I just cut it out and turned it upside down :D
---
The only BAD thing about this, is that it only got like 80 UPVOTES! Unless it's stolen, then go commit deathpacito
---
how about make so you can't score own goals
---
only the enemy team can get the ball in your goal
---
More like "top 10 anime betrayls"
---
It’s a joke dumbass
---
Upvote the original post!!
---
Does he take dmg from poison clouds in showdown when underground
---
Three words: Cool.
---
That's one word but Bull don't care
---
👍🏼
---
so thats why theres so much bad mortis players
---
I would give an award if I had one
---
The roast
---
Serious
---
dang, i'm so dumb. Nah man, the people hear "are all 5 ye." Totally what I meant.
---
Matchmaking also takes into account your total trophies.
---
Don't remember the name but it was top quite recently, maybe someone else has it
---
Supercell doesn t care about his comunity...
---
Brawl Stars is portrait again!!! 🤯
---
People who write “japonese” trigger me
---
Yes because if he won't he will be able to win the whole match with one super
---
Where is Nita? \*Sad Bear Noises\*
---
U probably deserved it
---
Nnnnnoooooooooooooo!!!!!
---
bibi is ma name baseball is ma game pls no that will be coping and pasting phrases
---
This. At least for the last siege. For the others I'd keep the current mechanic. This would add some strategy, maybe along with flattening the amount of bolts each "round".
---
I can make more fusions if you guys request them :)
---
Tracing isn't a skill, if you actually want to improve develop your own style and draw regularly
---
Go commit Dynamike Mortis
---
I dont punch it i throw it away
---
No, a hammer goes thomp thomp and a pickaxe goes thonk thonk
---
Please don't team. It was a good play but it annoyed me that you tried to team. Just play the game right.
---
Thank you :)
---
Low effort, bad joke
---
I suggest his name to be a pun like: flash to giro all the other brawlers
---
The Bats Revolving
---
no

27x30 = 810

and 30x30 = 900

Explain why do you think i just repost i didn't nothing
---
I havent posted in a while and i had nothing to do so i just made something low effort
---
Its a fixed event modifier. Just like thousand lakes will ALWAYS have healing shrooms and scorched stone will ALWAYS have meteors
---
Well I’ve seen this same image a week ago on this sub
---
Thanks!
---
Yeah for a while my clash Royale clan was number 1 local in Saharan Africa even though everyone in it was from America
---
4.873
---
I was more thinking the enemy Rico attempting to kill the primo on his way to own goal was funny
---
Mortis and dyna please
---
Money you’re willing to spend on the game?
---
Zero.
---
So then show the image
---
I didn’t save it sorry
---
Very good idea but the problem is that people won't always be watching every player at once and good plays could be missed whereas with the current system good plays are always taken into account. Also people are rarely going to vote for enemy players when they lose because they'll be in a bad mood - how about I vote for the guy that made me lose 10 siege trophies, a hell no.
---
Wow... You're right! haha
---
Why dont they make emotes on brawl star
---
Whats his star power gonna do to him?
---
The cake is a lie
---
Alright I’ll get working on that one soon! The enemies will soon become one.
---
Same thing happens with Shelly all the time
---
Can't relate ☺
---
Precise🤣
---
LOOK before commenting. The official name of “Taiwan” is “the Republic of China”, and the official name of mainland China is “the People’s Republic of China”. You see the difference???
---
Thrower teamers aren’t even a threat. Any other team between brawlers is 10x worse because everyone targets thrower teams.
---
This would be the best map
---
False. Before yes, but now no.
---
Yeah piper would be horrible , and , u know what , they should add about 2 more throwers and a new throwers game mode , its a good idea
---
What u saying about el primo!?
---
THANK YOU I APPRECIATE IT!!🤩🤩😍😍
---
Damn Top 10 anime betrayals
---
Too op
---
Go commit die
---
ngl that trickshot was fire
---
Only problem is the tara and primo starpowers (no way this would work outside of friendly battles)
---
He is a legendary becuase he is the best brawler in the game
---
It's hard to find when you are 12k+
---
you realize 70% of this sub are teamers right?
---
I think that the map looks a bit too big, however other than that, this seems absolutely amazing. Love the use of spring traps, makes games more exciting.
---
Imagine seige...
---
Beak is on point
---
The jokes on you I AM L premoe
---
That's impossible. He had to be playing the game before global release because that was the only time you could get Dynamike from boxes.
---
No thanks obvious pyramid scheme didnt even have to click, reported
---
=Rosa
---
This Nita looks like a man
---
🤣
---
I have a half day left. That’s it
---
Better petition would be to have both robots go out each time a siege occurs at whatever level they would be. Winning robot gets to advance to the safe.
---
Reading this as an italian is kinda funny, the baby is actually saying "boobs". Yeah I know, very childish but still funny
---
This is what they should ALREADY do
---
\*a very interesting title
---
\*a bull
---
Looks very much like him
---
Good job
---
Broken
---
In your opinion, others might not like BB
---
Removed. Rule 3. No providing information on how to break Supercell Terms of Service.
---
That is Lowkey a good idea to have tiny islands of 1-2 tiles then all water and you only can play Darryl
---
You should do a bigger hat for him
---
Ok?
---
This needs more upvotes
---
What about gold one?
---
An 8
---
At lower trophies, that’s REALLY easy
---
so funny 😂😂😂😂
---
and yes report system indeed
---
Yeah that's true but this isn't even a cool clip like in all of my games in bounty a huge comeback as good as this happens around 20% of the time because the game mode is specifically designed to allow comebacks to occur because of the star system. Something like this has probably happened to you as well, but you just aren't remembering because it wasn't even that exciting
---
Ah Kill it
---
Why do I see this picture moving
---
*Rosa has entered the chat*
---
This was posted earlier today
---
It depends on the brawler, if they waste all 3 and their recharge is slow, then they fight with only two attacks instead of a full 3 I get annoyed.
---
Nice. I got mortis like 5 minutes before I watched this
---
What in the absolute frick, what curse have you brought upon this land?
---
