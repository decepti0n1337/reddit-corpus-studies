Just tell your whole clan mates to report, for him to get a permanent banned
---
As a club leader ... grow some balls and kick them if they have been inactive or low in trophies they should know why they are kicked
---
This is an amazing skin!

Nice

wow nice!

Not to mention, brawlers with super that can get to those islands.
---
r/shittybrawlstars
---
That will not please me though
---
If matchmaking is based off of brawler power, then whenever you level up, you will just be playing against people with basically the same power as before because now the enemies also have the same power as you. Starpowers don't fix this because if you're level 10, your enemies are level 10 as well.
---
I feel bad you don't deserve this
---

---
I like your content but then someone steals it
---
User flair check outs...

Should be a star point skin lol

Welcome to reddit here’s karma

If you want to waste your time, thats fine with me. Have a great day.

I know right, what do you think he must've done hmm this could be anything 
---
HE LITERALLY JUST TOOK A FUCKING SCREEN SHOT
---
Such effort
---
Yes, i will.

At least i m not wating time losing trophys cuz this matchmaking suckx!

you too woozapo!

Still earn some brass,  it's all good

Thank you some one who knows how to play in this game mode

Actually, politics have been involved in video games recently. Surely you’ve heard about how Mei from Overwatch became a symbol of protest after the Blizzard incident.
---
everyone: NICE ART CONGRATULATIONS

Pam back then looked like total shit. She was a guy called the mini gunner before becoming herself.
---
Yes ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Cool bro..... You blowed my mind

---
Thanks

Real life: bull charges toward the turret and then a shelly kills him
---
TO BE CONTINUED
---
You realize that the Primo remodel had been in the works for a very long time before you “suggested” it? And they were always gonna add another legendary at some point. 
---
If they really cared about the community, matchmaking would be their top priority. But improved matchmaking doesn’t bring in the bucks. New legendaries and remodeled brawlers with now more expensive skins does!
---
Yes
---
Bro that was unneeded, the kid is just having a good time! Heck, his cosplay is actually decent!
---
OHOHOHO
---
That could be turned into a song
---
The catch is you will unimaginable fun, that you may experience a heart attack, but dont worry, nurse pam is gonna be inside your vacation home in the upperest floor, but the true catch is that dizzy may be pray for some cats around those parts, so as long as you protect her, she'll be Great!
---
If you’re playing brawl ball with mortis as a random, yes, he is bad, and you are losing because of you. Mortis is only semi decent on the right maps with the right team comp and a plan. If you bring mortis to brawl ball as a random, you are the bad random.
---
How original
---
I think this happened to me so it might be rare
---
goddammit i had this idea and was also gonna name it duels lol. nice
---
Ahaha so cute
---
Trophies?
---
I’m sorry but there’s no way I wouldn’t rage like hardcore playing this
---
*oh it isnt stuck,i locked it*
---
Why would you even ask that?
---
They just seem like scrapped ideas to me. A lot of them seem broken.
---
Saving my award for the final video...
---
A truly rare brawler
---
I GOT CHIIIILLLSS!!! THEY’RE MULTIPLYING!

You expected a clear pathway towards the teamers, but it was me, Dio!

you dont even know what language we are speaking! Dont be an idiot xenofobic if you cant difference tacos from feijoada, putinho

It's kind of like the flat part of a hill, like the top where it stops rising, btw nice art, I'm bad with clay...
---
gringo chato da porra
---
ta louco esses cara ae
---
Okay then, it’s a deal! *puts a hand out for a shake*
---
I am saying I think he wasn't attacking on purpose, therefore he was being targeted
---
How about which bull are u but they're all angry
---
Not attacking is also a part of the thing.
---
Deal my freind! *grabs hand*
---
The real question is why not
---
Agreed
---
Thanks :)
---
It’s a reference to Grease-You’re The One That I Want. He looks like a greaser with that leather jacket.
---
I fricking need that
---
ah, the clash of clans and royale way...i can't believe sc still use different systems in a similar clan feature.
---
Don’t shake, THE DAMN SCREEN
---
Оh, okay
---
I STILL havent got bibi. Piper was my most recent brawler and befor that i got leon, tara and mortis... i hate my luck with epics
---
But where would you spawn?
---
I play Bo with Eagle eye
---
Why.. it's perfect
---
#8
---
Because i can't unlock any new brawler for the past 2 months
---
nice one
---
Can you give credit to the original poster? You made the meme but the star power shop isn't your image
---
AHHH so this is why supercell invented Sandy XD

Oh no he's hot

I've never seen Brawl Stars + Minecraft. Well done

I like the look of that spider Rosa!

I like the ideas. The dyna sp could actually be buffed

its easy . only youmust be closer to him.then dodge him

**C L A P**
---
Link the original creator of the art
---
you kill if they are already on low health. you don't actively pick fights.
---
Is this even serious? Dude who fucking cares.
---
Underrated post
---
Leon isnt even that great in the meta, at least bibi is a great brawler. Leon lacks in everywhere but solo modes, which are full if teaming
---
Literally everyone on the sub.
---
:D
---
Great concept
---
What? R34? No, no. I think you must've missread that..
---
NOOOO
---
It’s allowed. If it wasn’t, it wouldn’t happen. Supercell has *literally* said it’s a strategy. Grammar mistakes? HAHAHAHAHAHA...you’re even dumber than your original post made you seem. First of all, if you wanted to be grammatically correct, you would have said grammatical errors. You’ve clearly never heard of idioms. And try hard is two words. It could be one word if you’re using a commonly accepted internet slang, but I prefer to speak English.

I’m sorry to break it to you man but that is easy
---
I don't get it
---
No, that would be TOO MUCH text
---
Even then you stated that there WILL be a brawl talk in the post
---
So many amazing skin ideas, supercell better start taking notes
---
My only complain is the lag
---
Watch [this video](https://youtu.be/j6MR8u9icmQ). 
---
Technically, “try hard” is two words, but your using it as a noun, so you need to add a hyphen. And everything you said were just plain grammar errors, you didn’t use a single idiom. You literally just proved to me that you know nothing about grammar.
---
Oh and I ALSO found an pack wich cost money and u would get the "beesniper" + sum gems
---
SHAKING MY HEAR MY HEAD 🤣🤣🤣 IM DEAD💀💀💀💀💀
---
Who just down voted piper?
---
Why do they always go to the middle of the map during countdown.  Also, try not to shake the screen next time.
---
Just install rs data manager
---
Because it would be possibly the most extraordinary discovery ever??
---
I see it now
---
Quite clearly
---
Thanks :D
---
Camp in showdown ez trophies, or use him in bb
---
Fuk toxic peeps

i didn't get rico till 4.5k

Once again, *you’re. Not your. I’m just going to stop trying to reason with you on your clear lack of understanding of a language in which you’re trying to feign expertise. But I will have you note my correct usage of your and you’re in the previous sentence.
---
And obviously not everyone hates teaming or nobody would team. 
---
I’m done with you. As Confucius once said, “Don’t argue with idiots on the internet. They drag you to their level and beat you with experience.” Have a good night. Dick bag.

Confucius say, elevator smell very different to little person.

And “keep a close eye on it”....you’re grasping on straws.
---
That video is from April. It’s now October. Six months is more than enough data to make reasonable determinations on how to proceed. Clearly they’re satisfied that they’ve reduced teaming enough. And I would argue that they have. Teaming has significantly dropped the past few months. It still happens. But I haven’t seen games where there are 6-7 people teaming. Which used to be the norm.
---
The chances to be matched with the same player twice is not that high anyway, but they will go on to do the same with others 😒😒
---
Yep

Bo I don't think I will

its a new skin are you blind?

Maybe you can use my bat as harsh punishment for those crows trying to escape
---
Hmm, the downvoted say otherwise.
---
They aren't really Mythic and Legendary brawlers anymore if they're on the Trophy Road. Also, what if someone already had all of the brawlers unlocked?
---
[removed]
---
well, gedi is infact korean as far as i know
---
is it me or smash of franks sounds like clash of clans XD
---
If this happens you're just bad
---
bOK
---
It usually happens when you lose with a bad random and then the random is on the enemy team
---
piper rosa
---
For dyna, it should be a team of dynamike

dont play mortis in brawlball

Hmm alright seems about right. I’ll take 21 please.

My friend got all mythics at december but not primo

You can't get to a meme review with under 1k upvotes

I tilted my rank 20 level 3 mortis at 470 trophies but i don't find power points for him and when i found some i arrived at 49/50. I have 310 points for 39 gems in the shop but i have 37
---
How old is this picture?
---
I never thought Bull could look more badass. But there you go.
---
Good stuff man just keep grinding it out and eventually you'll get one
---
9 always 9 xD
---
Slice and dice
---
Rank 20 is not competitive, I'd say rank 24 or 25
---
Honestly the only problem in this image to me is teaming.
---
Yes! Ans i'll give you the honors of that! We will make sure no crows try to escape! Thank you, and here is some chocolate!

How many trophies u have

Brock's shots are harder to dodge. my opinion

1k players be like

Crow is on the remodel list along with Pam, daryll, and frank
---
r/youbrokethechain

Yeah if you can aim really well with brock, then its hard.

Looks like your relationship with Brock and Rico didn't work out?
---
If that Bull didn’t charge out recklessly he would had killed you though..
---
Nice Clutch btw
---
So I will get a free legendary. ^nice
---
these hands are creepy lol
---
Lol true, on my mini i have maple barley and i win a lot but on my main i don't have it and i can't push him to 550
---
Not all randoms are afk,
---
Some are bad, really bad!
---
Urgh so true
---
Glitch, when you click on chat and play on the same button
---
I didn't knew Barney could be hot
---
This is the stuff I would create alt accounts for just to upvote twice. Brilliant idea, I hope Supercell sees!
---
To be fair I bought one mega box using real money and a 1000 token doubler using gems
---
Definitely 5
---
Liar
---
They'd have to alter season end reset, to add checkpoints at Rank 25, 30 and 35 or something so people would be able to get that many trophies. I'm struggling to sustain 18k, so there's some thought to come.
---
Bruh, on my mini I have 10.5k and No leggies, Tara or Mortis
---
That explains it
---
Step 1: Kite
---
The End.
---
Rest is just 5000 blank pages.
---
Bralwstats and check out big youtubers aka Coach Cory/karios Time
---
Currently at 15k :D
---
Or, a mega box that guarantees them a mythic/legendary.
---
Plz provide the link of this youtube video
---
I checked last time and there is one called ‘game-thrower’
---
People should'nt post dank memes and should post fine things like these.
---
2 Shellys in my team and in the enemy team. ALSO the Shelly in my team has only 370+ trophies! Fix this
---
From what I've noticed the power level is also a factor for some reason
---
Wait are you that Poco i play every second game that tries to kill me when i play Bull
---
I have 21
---
You guys must not chat much and his join request just sat there and someone finally accepted it. That’d be my guess but idk.
---
Um... You know that it is name color changer, right?
---
His hair should be longer ✅
---
Enemy team: Am i a joke to you
---
Wait what? Randoms in lone stae?
---
How
---
Used to like Snake Prairie but Circling Eagle Bo just ruins the fun. The main thing about Snake Prairie is the "Hide and seek" + surprise element and Circling Eagle Bo just defeats the purpose
---
yeah but he has to use attack, which with his slow reload isnt always ready
---
Lol didn't u see the chats above that. They are 3 hrs before he sent request. U can see clearly in the image!
---
Woah. 
---
Many of there are very well thought out! 
---
Great job OP!
---
Yes but if someone is low health then we kill him
---
I like these rewards, but I’d make each starpower reward only 1 of choice. People with maxed out accounts like that probably don’t need them, and people who spent money (or just a lot of in-game currency) would probably be upset to see it be wasted if they bought star powers in the past.
---
Right?
---
Won't happen.
---
It’s normal at least for me
---
This is actually good
---
Well everyone is a random in Lone Star
---
Wait what?Piper is one of the most OP brawlers in the game,he probably said that because he dont know how to aim his shots
---
There's no way to see this in game. So much reward. I think that is necessary to make interesting the trophy road adding more rewards for more trophies range, but this is too much.
---
Well yes, but actually no
---
Yea
---
Isn’t a group of Leons called Hoodie Homies? /s
---
Probably? Anyway, lately I've been teaming with Bulls and others to help me stop Colt from ruining Takedown. 
---
Does the Poco consistently get 4th-6th?
---
Lmao Rank 20 is nothing, it's so hard to even tilt below Rank 20
---
I got Morris to 500+ on rank 3 by playing brawl ball lol
---
He stops them all from growing properly.....? I must’ve missed the latest patch!
---
Ik but still maybe they add a skin that you will like it more then this one
---
You should add a reward tier for exp levels
---
Good meme use my meme template
---
https://routinehub.co/shortcut/3688
---
You can get it for free here. :)
---
You see, as Poco, Tara or Sandy, your attack goes wide and far, meaning that if you hit the bot you're also gonna hit a bunch of players too. Abuse this to the max, and damage players, as if there's only five players instead of ten killing the bot it will compensate for their bad DPS, and stacking cubes quickly snowballs and renders you unstoppable for the rest of the match.
---
It is definitely special that six people out there tried to amaze and get a laugh out of people like me and the community, and even try to please cynical children like you. They got my upvote, don't spread toxicity.
---
When it come down from 5 sec, the words will be bigger if the second left is lower
---
I have a new and good idea: 1 new skin for brawler's 25/30/35 rank
---
AFK-ing is griefing
---
Its fine. In the future I should just put my reddit username on my memes to show that its mine rather than putting it in the title
---
I know
---
Gene
---
Right. I saw that. Idk how invites work. My club has rarely been invite only. I just figured whenever they’re accepted it goes to the bottom of the chat.

especially since he can perma stun after hitting 3 enemies at once
---
You made one of the coolest skins ive seen here
---
Wow so cool
---
Bull isn't the best pick with medium-high range of trophies
---
Jess do this
---
Or chain his super again especially if u play a tank
---
Yeah, that's a good idea. Or if you have one meme style attributed to you, that works too.

Idea: Give us more free shit
---
Well actually no
---
Brawl stars would be just like clash royale and no fun if the trophy road was like this the gems are waaay to much and the legendary brawler. It would be to ez to get stuff if this was a thing. I like most of these like the coins, tickets, and the mega boxes and star power this is a really good idea but it needs some minor fixes
---
11k reward isa not that useless, i like it
---
This Primo is literally on fire
---
You're welcome! You'll see that once you get the hang of him you'll love it. At first I didn't like him either but now he's one of my favourite brawlers.

Suddenly she throws out a giant bear and shouts; “ Nita! “ or “ )2&amp;$49; “

0.1% of players have reached 14000 trophies... Even less would reach 15000

Secondly, they are making millions of dollars from this game already.
---
They would not go bankrupt
---
It's amazing how good Gene actually is, especially with his starpower. Pushed him from 500 to 900 yesterday and currently ranking in top 100 worldwide.
---
But he spins in literally every mode it's not just showdown 
---
People just notice it more in showdown

I just thought about something : if the mythic brawler is on trophy road, then it becomes a mythic/trophy road brawler, then what color is he? Red for mythic or grey light for trophy road?

u forgot poco's super with 2nd star power

When there's a leon
---
AHH SO HOT
---
The pink one.
---
THICC
---
Yeah pretty OP, especially when most brawlers have a shield of about 28-30 percent. Plus most of those shields have very specific circumstances involving a super, that kind of makes close range brawlers pretty useless
---
not funny
---
Amazing!!!👍👍👍👍👍🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆
---
didn't laugh
---
Nita is black :))))

Did you just correct his grammar and then make a mistake TOO? Bold.
---
Noice
---
That’s what I said if you don’t like these jokes just leave them … u really need to comment everywhere and I get more downvotes !!! … you’re the type of guy who always find jokes everywhere
---
We need brawl stars merch!
---
My change to find good teammates %-50
---
Yes. But I mean the old version with five minute long matches. I agree it had its issues, but to me it felt far more strategic than other modes, had a very well-designed objective and the match length was just right. I also loved how matches had a clear vector and couldn't be turned upside down by a single (un)lucky play. 
---
The current version is a joke tho.
---
Evt çaktırma
---
Spike And Sandy
---
  
---
          OR 
---
SPIKE AND SANDY
---
Congratulations
---
Gonna be honest here, not looking foward to a Crow remodel. I'd say an animation rework would be fine, and maybe some stuff to add to white crow. I totally see why they would remodel Pam and Frank, and I'm wondering if they'll actually forget to remodel Dumpling Darryl when they remodel Darryl.
---
Stando power!!
---
teamkill feature is needed
---
Would love to have a cheeseburger now. The art is epic.keep going man🤩😍
---
Wow! You made it like it's a real star power! Thanks for reworking this idea!
---
When you become invisible and then you missclick to attack button:
---
Remember kids. Playing the way you like makes you dumb. Toxic, overused "probably bad play/strategy" memes are overused and unfunny since day one. Can you do me a favor? Just fuck off. Thx
---
Spooky!!
---
How to get in Coach Cory's meme review 101
---
Kind of OP since that's her weaknes and by buffing a weaknes without a concicence it's going to make her pretty much unstopable.
---
I say, that this is very good.

You too?
---
Shelly: yOu UnDeReStImAtE mE
---
I was half expecting a self goal out of pity
---
maybe, but it’s like I didn’t lose so often
---
It's just been done many times
---
I have 3k and i have spune and star shelly
---
ZA WARUDO WA SAIKIONO STANDO DA
---
More brock skins
---
I think if she took and dealt less dmg it would balance it out.
---
 Bro that makes so much sense
---
damn boi he thicc boi
---
gEnE iS oP iN bOsS fIgHt

Yup it was on purpose lmfao wouldn’t*
---
Dolo Showdown!
---
#(ノಠ益ಠ)ノ
---
Exactly!
---
Hhmmmhhh Morris paradise I see
---
i want to get tokens for kills in showdown. 1 kill = 5 tokens
---
And howndo you know that
---
That’s because they use the same audio *you goose*
---
"Buying coins with gems is worth it!"
---
"Okay, shoot him again."
---
Me : let me tell mine
---
Supercell : yes ?
---
Me : why leon is blind
---
Supercell : idk, cus he have a hoodie ?
---
Me : yes.... *cries*
---
Bull using his super be like
---
Yea many possibilities but you're right about one thing, he is running away from something and he isn't the only one 😉
---
Right! 😱
---
What if Piper teams tho lol
---
CURSED
---
Flaaaaaaame ON
---
You're defiantly right that every brawler has specific maps and modes that make them good or bad, i guess it all depends on how you use the terms: broken, op, good, great. I dont think the legies break the game (apart from sandy) but i do think they are easier to push so id say they are all "better brawlers" than most others. The way i view brawlers is if they're easier to push that means they're typically better but i definatly agree with you that it all depends on each persons play style, i just play really aggresive so i like the legies more
---
Heart rate 130
---
i see it all the time lol
---
Good map. But idk why i dont like maps with many bushes on brawl ball. But i would play on this map!
---
make a path on those mirroring patches of water and it would be great
---
she already has rainbow tail of her main attack
---
Thats a great idea! Thanks man :)
---
Brawl stars is a fast paced game so emotes would be useless
---
Great
---
*Lol has entered the chat* JK
---
Plot twist: the shelly has her super
---
Coach kill-me
---
Sometimes I really hate my internet...
---
And we will see it on all videos of funny moments in brawl stars lmao
---
Do many times happened with me that an enemy is targeting me in close range, and it should be one more shot to charged my super, but i' die before i can use it. So i think it can be help in some terrible situation.
---
I'll look. I'll warn you though, it's very NSFW.
---
Ngl that looks sweet
---
oh god,rule 63
---
looks decent tho

Almost forgot, you can repost this if you want, but please put the credits in the title :)
---
Facts
---
Kinda the point
---
There are a lot of starpowers that cover the weakness of the brawlers tho. For example Mortis both starpowers (the first helping to survive after a kill since you take a lot of damage and the second to get close to opponents easier) but yeh I agree this would make piper way too op
---
Probably not the best choice of words...
---
thats because of ambush
---
sometimes your internet is fine but it still lags
---
Your drawing skills are so good, but dude what the fuck is that concept. Please don't misunderstand me...
---
I have both kings in the game who do you think is going to be the third one from the royal family
---
No u
---
And yes, i was a bad random once. I tried to pass the ball to my teammate but accidently ended up scoring our own goal.
---
Well that means she is an *sshole🙃
---
LeOnS sUpErS aTtAcK iS 506!?
---
True, a lot of people are stupid. Also, r/barleygang
---
Hjönk
---
Robo Spike
---
should have been 9.5/10
---
Wow such a great idea.
---
I love this skin 10/10
---
That too.
---
Who saw the pokemon wheel on back :D
---
I don't have star powers on Piper but I see the rainbow tail on the pink skin and don't see on the normal one
---
They can still score even when their teammates are in the way
---
so?
---
Now hide from police, he was 13 years old
---
When you can’t think of original content,you decide to repost.
---
There's no reason for going back and shooting
---
Spike is sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo cute
---
if i was one of them green dudes i would use my just in case move
---
me: \*spits\*
---
franks: \*spends 36 seconds washing his face\*
---
My team: \*unfrozed\*
---
frank: oof
---
Question at what trophy range can you be on brawl T.V? 700?
---
I guess colt hates his dad (bull)
---
This reminds of Eruptor from Skylanders
---
I trough ppl whouldnt like it -^-
---
MY chance to find good teammates -100%
---
But sandy does need a nerf
---
It doesn't change much. The 10IQ troll will just hold on to the ball and stand right in front of the goal, waiting for the opponents to come take the ball from them and score.
---
This idea is great at preventing"Self Goals", but doesn't solve the "Trolling" problem.
---
Don't worry though, 10IQ trolls usually die early IRL because of the stupid shit they tend to do.
---
You still gets my upvote
---
Why tho
---
You forgot the eyebrows but its cool men how do you do that!?
---
Oh hell no... The screen is already cluttered enough thank you
---
Thx
---
This really wouldnt work with intentionally passing to ball to the enemy hoping they fall back and accidentally score
---
Americans: I’ll take your entire stonk
---
# how the repost got 1k upvotes? HOW?!
---
This.... is the best idea I have EVER heard for brawl stars
---
SeLf ScoRiNg iS a StRategY
---
Nah, cuz accidents happen
---
It's soo good. It's beautiful, but the thought that supercell is never going to put this into the game hurts
---
So?
---
can be replaced with lag

#I HAVE ACHIEVED COMEDY
---
Cuz its epic
---
The idea and its execution of opening the parasol is great but 40% is a bit too much. Anyways great idea
---
RELATABLE
---
Just pointing out that your comment makes 0 sense.
---
Did this merchandise company even give credit to Gedi for his skins? I assume not.
---
repost
---
No shit Sherlock
---
Glad you appreciate it! I hope you win your freedoms.
---
As well as using his super, use his main attack as well
---
I got Mortis on my mini account when Tick came out. So low trophy showdown matches were a piece of cake. I hit 200 trophies and got humbled right away.
---
Welcome to Reddit! Also, nice art :)
---
I wish this post blow up and also this is some next level fan animation
---
Supercell just needs to make the Spooktober Update an update where all the fan-made Spooktober get added
---
You probably aren’t the best player if you have people that self score lol
---
Oh that's how mafia works? Hm..
---
TheFatLapras is a great username.
---
( im thefatlapras)
---
Yeah I've mortis for awhile still not at 500. I probably could if I played him more. But the reason I don't play him often is because he is so situational/map dependant/high skill cap
---
I used too love it back when it was five minutes game but now it does be like that
---
Looks awesome, what metal did you make it out of?
---
Shelly needs a perfect Super and a good hit the recharge. In your world every Shelly can pull this off no problem. Reality is different.
---
This should be used in game.
---
But what if you have all mythics at 10k? Because my friend only needs the legendary's and he's at 10k
---
Because they have to work. They don't have time looking at shitty memes
---
Sucks when you have that one cocky player who messes up all his shots
---
PiC-cOlLaGe
---
It's a nice idea, but SC wpuld never implement it because ~~games that are too f2p don't make money and get discontinued #savePvZH~~ they suck and don't want us to be happy for no reason.
---
Or "That's the way I like it!".
---
It’s the small details that make this game great!
---
in a siege map.I don´t remember which map apeears,but is a siege map
---
OOF
---
I thought this meme would be a comedy but now its a  tragedy #clownarmy
---
Honestly tho... this looks pretty cursed. 9/10
---
Like nobody ever did that
---
Not really, he seems pretty balanced to me...
---
yep
---
That was exactly my point. I’m honored that post inspired someone to make this post.
