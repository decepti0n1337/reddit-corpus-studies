Definitely, they gave us a rare then super rare and then an epic. It only makes since that mythic would be next

Sneak 100

---
Also at least ur gonna get tic
---
That’s korean
---
Colt's shoots are bigger
---
But come on we had no way to beat them, we were all tanks and we literally couldnt move without the three turrets sniping us..
---
Why in the hell does bibi look like just came out from filming an anime movie or something japanese?
---
Your comment is a joke
---
Looks better than the original.

If they do this ....

I bet you are from r/freefolk ;)

It really do be like that sometimes

It's the dad.

r/BrawlstarsP
---
Literally 2 shot to most of the brawlers lol
---
I might do some in the future! I don’t think I have the skill to create gedi-kor level stuff tho
---
Wait so just wondering, did penny kidnapp the turret while tick was just going to the store or did he technically abandon the turret
---
I deleted the post cause it instantly got negative karma
---
Me: that’s pretty cool
---
Everyone: this is my favourite so far!!!
---
What's her new star power?
---
I’m gonna do what I like to call a **pro gamer move**

Tengo una idea para una  brawler nueva 
---
se llama marina, es una sirena su poder es lanzar burbujas distancia media como nota su ultimeit es que conchas la protejen y cada golpe que le lanzan se rregreza con mismo daño y efecto su categoría es súper especial su abolidas especial después de los puntos de fuerza es que dos cangrejos con 500 de vida persiguen y atacan a los enemigos esa es mi idea gracias ojalá la escuchen mi usuario de juego es ☯️OMC 1228☯️
---
That musketeer looks so cute
---
Yeah yeah got that but I lag most of the time 😅 probably server issues
---
Even better
---
But is a new brock skin :(
---
Idk I’ve been waiting for a skin for bo for a while but this one just looks so completely different from him that it’s kind of disappointing. Ig I’ll have to wait and see it in game
---
ArE yOu SuRe AbOuT tHaT¿
---
Thanks for explaining the joke Peter!
---
YeS
---
Oh sorry! That was my first post ever and I’m new to Reddit so I did not know what would happen but I was intending to make a joke about something in the game.
---
She’s (hopefully) getting a remodel. [proof](https://mobile.twitter.com/rlighton)
---
Game on!
---

---
GEDI, YOUR BACK

Oh i'm not sure. Haven't seen it but maybe.
---
Yes. What did it cost? Everything.
---
Ok then...
---
Ok got to be honest, you make amazing 'staches
---
**The bat’s face and her earrings are also gone**

Im watching this image while making som kind of rock cover of the brawl stars theme in my head
---
[removed]
---
Why does the art style remind me of Sr Pelo?!
---
# Coincidence, I think not!
---
Your username says otherwise
---
Hi hungry I’m dad
---
One word: Fortnite. They leave and return.
---
If you rewatch the Brawl Talk, you can also got Star Points from brawler rank-ups
---
As I said before, 100% agree
---
the enemy team must be triggered
---
Mega Super Ultra Thicc
---
He's so fricking unrealistic
---
Somebody gotta do Luna-tick where he's like a moon or sumth
---

---
Yeah, lol. So funny how people were talking that, there will be no reasons to use Balls of Fire, while we don't even know what it does.
---
Now I can’t unsee that lol
---
actually yeah

the other day I saw a guy post and say in the title "don't roast me cause I'm 11". Well smarty, 11 year olds aren't allowed on Reddit.
---
Well, I’m saving boxes for Shelly, hope I get her :)
---
How about you start posting memes that I down vote and show me the effort you put in. Also look at my other memes then
---
Lol the star powers have already been released like two days ago
---
That’s cool and some randoms are good like the ones in solo showdown but most I find are probably babies slapping the phone
---
So do I
---
Your flaire is Tara
---
Hmm id love to see a poco in a maid outfit
---
The solution is to have some way of getting more gems to save up easier
---
I don't need to change you mind poco is HOT
---
Congrats!! I got a completely new account and got him and Leon before 3k trophies free to play
---
Lucky 🤣
---
Yeah, i searched and found It, you're right
---
Oh rip I’m not gonna spend that much
---
Second satr power which probably is "well oiled"
---
That 5% in under 4K trophies
---
Get a dimond bird with it
---
Yep
---
*Table slapping noises as the Shellies spam auto aim*
---
Stop saying you’re a noob at art, you are very good. Much better than I am. Believe in yourself and work hard. I hope you reach the standard you want. Love you drawing.
---
That looks incredible! Dont call yourself a noob
---
if you have all brawlers at 9 or 10 basically everyday they're going to offer you a star power
---
Yay gg
---
Liking this new GEDI-KOR cinematic universe
---
Waht?
---
Better than top hat
---
Y'know I bet there will be a glitch when the update hits that makes it so players already above 4000 won't be able to unlock Tick straight away 😂
---
This a old ass dead meme and it's not funny anymore meta memes are fresh and new making it more funny if you want new memes go get some from r/memetemplatesofficial
---
Nope, trust me, once I had 6 brawlers at level 9 and for 3 days all I got was powerpoint offers
---
dude you are literally like me. when i was 4k i did not have any epics, mythic, legends and Rico. however,   i had saved up thirty boxes. i had saved them up for Rosa release. when i opened them on the day Rosa was released, i got Leon, Rosa, Gene and Tara so keep your hopes up :)
---
*happy u/alimem974 noises
---
I like bull's expression.
---
Against long range brawlers you have to be close and attack from a bush. Against close range brawlers you have to stay far away.
---
Bo is in my top favorite brawlers, so I'm definitely saving gems to buy the skin. I rarely buy skin, only bought the Nita Panda skin. But this, this is a must have since I'm a transformer fan too
---
“I’m still worthy”
---
You funny guy😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

I see you are a man of culture as well

Lol this skin is gonna be made

Fow what reason? To get more Shelly points and a bit more gold?

r/lostredditors and also what the fuck is wrong with you
---
r/lostredditors
---
They're one of the most f2p companies lmao 
---
They literally give you Barley for free, and all the trophy road brawlers for free. Actually, you can get everything in the game for free, if you save up enough gems for skins. Every brawler can be obtained for free.

Lmao i thought he would say tick is my game bombs are my game
---
I got Gene on the 20th of May, Rosa and Bibi back to back two weeks later, and Nita’S star power a few days ago.

Nah, the bombs do less damage and are avoided easier.

Yes it is

Yes basically

Free box for players above 4k and we also get Tick after the update!
---
Love this art style
---
You must've not played when Rosa was released. Every single player was a Rosa, any gamemode. No exception
---
Get nae nae'd
---
You’ve become the very thing you swore to destroy.
---
Pipe Spike. Spipe.
---
Well, you are right. Anyway I have already reached this milestone
---
Because they are super rare and epic and lots of players are f2p
---
I like the fact that u fused both sf s together with the sf3 background.
---
I was betraying them its called tactics.
---
Poor lvl 3 crow then
---
Update comes
---
But you called yourself out by saying it was clickbait. Also you can't promote yourself on this subreddit

Update is most likely happening today or mb tomorrow

Update tomorrow!

Bruh all the secrets are in the other countries brawl talks. First it’s Japan telling us tik’s star power letting him heal faster and  know this

Great thing about having a new brawler
---
Splatoon Penny?
---
Why not both
---
Minecraft Mike
---
Sorry I don't get it, does it mean he will start healing at a shorter time rather than 3 seconds or will heal a higher percentage of health per second after 3 seconds?

---
The update is tomorrow?
---
Ik zit op 6k, heb Frank en Bibi (en alles daaronder) voor de rest niks. Maar idd ze moeten echt meer goud geven aan spelers.
---
Where did u get that
---
Did you draw that spike?
---
In Facebook's
---
Ik hoop dat die starpoints iets nuttig worden

BREAK THE CENTER OR JUMP INTO IT. USE YOUR SKILLS , BEWARE OF CAMPERS AND GET A VICTORY

F dude. Sorry to hear that. My brother got Spike at 2k and im at 5600

How did he not even see u lol
---
No Frank relax

If Piper is lvl 1 and Tick is lvl 1 then no
---
Penny's mortar
---
he looks like a gorilla
---
Im a creature of the night! Btw we are allies right?
---
Dead Jessie's turret killing you 
---
Is this LOSS?
---
Im guessing you are 6.. right?
---
This game has over 50 million players, a minority can still mean 10 million players. Of course you see a lot of Bibis, many got her and played her when she got released. And you still see a lot of Bibis because many are still unlocking her and playing their new bralwer.
---
Thicc
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
I guess he didn't want to kill his sibling XD
---
\*guys he escaped the basement\*
---
Actually i am not excited, i am pretty sure i would be able to unlock mythic brawler because i have almost nothing else to unlock (just few star powers) so now he is trophy road all game mode will be a disaster
---
And they said you can’t hear a picture
---
*angry penny noises
---
I got Darryl in my first
---
NSFW incoming
---
Excuse me wtf I am a f2p at 6600 and have 2 star Powers (Pam and Colt) and Bull and Shelly at power 9
---
Still waiting it's funny that all my friends who just started the game with 200 trophies got a legendary and I'm saving up gems to get one ..460 gems as of now
---
I can hear this picture
---
I have everybrawler power 9-10 but i still can't get brawl boxes or power points
---
You just proved my point ALLOT OF PEOPLE UNLOCKED HER my point is the update wasnt bad because they released and epic brawler its like saying genes and leons updates were bad because they are both high rarity brawlers
---
Tick is my name. Decapitating myself is my game
---
Tara gets a remodel but only for Korean players

Removed. Rule 3. No providing information on how to break Supercell Terms of Service.
---
Possible. Probably there are two new Brawlers but they don't announce it in Brawl Talk and keep it as a secret.
---
I always read his name as T H I C C
---
I'm expecting them to release Tic after the season end
---
Matchmaking at its best ..every supercell game ever

Carefully, she's a hero!

I can post it if ya like! It seemed long to post so I didn’t

Someone grab Tick and throw him to the ground 3 times

Well. Still hard earned.

---
5100 but I could easily go higher

How long before the update comes out? I'm in New Zealand so the holidays and stuff are a bit different to the rest of the world.

---
Play null's brawl and you will get how!!
---
I prefer White one
---
lmao
---
Not from pay to win player
---
The new brawler is trophy road though, so isn't that a win? You opened a mega box and will be getting Tick because you are 4K
---
So first you need to join my team to be my friend
---
Not from a pay to win player
---
You are totally right but autoaming generally is a disadvantage. 
---
You don't appear directly in the enemy, so you can always attack trying to hit him before he gets near you. If you can force people to go away, they won't get near you. But in the maps with a Bush-Middle you can't do anything against the 12 powercube fat camping rat Bull.
---
Autoaim was maid for people that doesn't try to win strategically. If they want to use it it's their lose. (And Mortis' lose also!)
---
Or a switch for each game mode, I have a feeling it being handy in SD, and Gem grab.
---
Este un glitch in matrix.... Gosh
---
It's good, this even happened to me, i got a post with 700 upvotes, the mods removed it for ''lOw eFforT'' it took me over 16 mintues to think of that joke
---
You're a legend
---
To the idiot who downvoted this, you try tilting your favourite brawler.
---
It is cool tho...But my favourite sci-fi caracters are Bumblebee and flash,and there not beeing a flash,i thinkbyou understand.
---
That's an ez 2 swipe for mortis,lol
---
[happy Tywin Lannister noises]

I once targetted a low HP gem carrier, about to ruin his day, but instead managed to grab an invisible Leon and got annihilated. Wasn't even mad.
---
Downvote
---
He is a trophy road reward my man
---
Might want to remove that kick button for bots though, it would be useless because technically you are playing with bots so if you kick a bot there is no bot?
---
Me too, my only mistake might be to put "so low quality even u/Darius won't steal it." but it's kinda obvious that's a joke and also it's because Idw to be embarrassed by how long it took me to come up with a simple joke
---
mai bine tacem pentr- fuck

Yes u
---
Two years 😨
---
Yeah autoaim definitely a nono anywhere at range but up close oof
---
He was on fire, but stupid.
---
You're my desire
---
a rework changing mechanics of a brawler or a massive change of stats and a remodel is changing what the brawler looks like
---
How even?
---
CONFUSION
---
he "sucks" slowing effect in? so he isnt affected

So when is the first week

Damn. I got buffed

He does 2700 damage to a box per shot at max level. Just takes 3 seconds for a shot to explode but he can just dump them all.

Piper no sinping! Piper no sniping!
---
Cavern Churn was my favourite map😪😪😓
---
Maybe he did it because the mortis/crow (whoever survived) was a much bigger threat with an energy drink. But then again he could have been born with half of his brain. But I think that the  1st one is more likely
---
TBH I don't realy get all that Ryan hype. i mean he seems cool and all, but isn't it a bit overhyped? Like seriously, if he annouce every new bralwler for 2k crystals everyone here would be ok with it
---
I thought that there will be something like "Leon" or "Tara" there 🤣
---
Me too
---
Just sign a contract with supercell, I bet tons of community artists just would do it for free
---
You're wrong. He's my-THICC

is this fanmade, or actual game files?

I totally disagree that they are fun. They do look cool. And look awesome. That’s why I buy the skins by saving it up. There’s no point of buying boxes or token doublers since you will eventually get all brawlers. So as a f2p I rather have more skins than brawler.

He didn’t get 1st place in showdown, before 30 trophies he played duo matches with someone above 30 trophies.

I encountered many power lvl 10's as a power lvl 1-7 before, they are just noobs that waste money on the game they are still bad, power lvls dont make them good only trophies do. And Suprcell only cares about the trophy matchmaking, they can't do anything about the power lvl. Even 3v3 people complain about the people's account trophies, but really only brawler trophies matter it shows how experienced they are with the brawler.

Woah!
---
You did it so fast
---
I suck at shelly ok?
---
I already am invisible to others
---
Im grending my brawler over 500 too xd
---
bro he has 2100 health which is the lowest in the game... He probably sucks the most at close range even more than piper XD.
---
Have they announced a date?
---
Do you have a main and what's it's trophy count?
---
I did it on purpose I thought others will go on
---
I played with top players
---
What does it mean
---
P K   F I R E !

Well guess what, you can wait and accumulate powerpoints for one brawler that you don't play, then upgrade him and eliminate everyone because they don't do enough damage to kill you. No money spent
---
Are you serious? You was able to play those maps only with specific brawlers
---
Finally Mortis got Third flavour of his Meal
---
You gotta think better than that: r/Mortisgang is gonna live the high life, new thrower to chase down and everyone has him unlocked! unless the mines go off instantly he seems like the easiest target in the game.
---
Lmfao
---
That level 10 tick is probably the pro players and youtubers XD.
---
OMG Legs ! r/brawlstarsp
---
We need a part 2!!!!!
---
Could have replaced the bear with Thiccochet

Idk

Lmao
---
Moo Moo Moo Moo Moo
---
Why does a paper boi need a bat
---
RIP
---
r/cursedcomments
---
As a f2p player I'm pretty goddamn excited!
---
Plus another thrower means Mortis got an indirect buff
---
Supercell: *adds new thrower*
---
Mortis Gang: It's free real estate
---
There is always a countdown
---
Probably today
---
tick is gonna be some nice tick-tac's in between all that dodging barley attacks

\*\*After the bird has been spun by Mike so many times, it decided to put matters in their own hands, controlling Mike, and going by his ways, spinning him, faster than ever.\*\*

That’s awesome thx for the feedback I’d love to see or hear your concepts when you are finished :)
---
Yes just mentioning him so he can see it
---
Barly is a robot bartender not a squished up trash can
---
That’s great and all until you need to play feast or famine for the star token lol
---
Yea ok but spike? sharp shooter? WTF
---
Yes
---
True dat
---
Very Very good
---
2200, actually. 3080/1.4 = 2200
---
Amen
---
*meh?*
---
Yes that too
---
How is this even possible?
---
I’ll be the rooooundabout
---
Which still remains low. Enough to be one shotted by dyna's super.
---
Well, not brawl talk, but what I'm assuming is that YouTubers such as Lex and Kairos will make videos of other stuff, which can include the remodels, I'm not sure, but they'll likely be allowed to showcase other new stuff.
---
nice
---
Reminds me of bin weevils. My son plays that shit too much lmao
---
Yup. If you want to see all the failed attempts, check out the clan he’s in called BoxingTheWorld. Every single account that he’s failed the challenge with is there. It’s pretty crazy.

Very true. Darryl can kill him one ammo, too. Just fixing your error.
---
lol imagine siege
---
Cute not going to lie
---
I think if you translate it to Russian, it's a tag people slap onto their names that signifies they like to team in sd
---
Np
---
I know, I'm just stating the fact
---
But nass is more powerful, what are you talking?
---
I’ve spent too many time on this sub
---
I think tick its already an pirate beacause he is a cannon and he looks like a pirate
---
once i wanted coins to upgrade my leon but when i opened a brawl box i got,i got mortis instead
---
Tick is delish til he pulls out his super lmao. If you think about it, tick’s supers are morti’s natural enemy.
---
Lucky and unlucky at one time
---
I spent 0$
---
You mixed up Piper with Tick. Better fix that
---
 from LA now live in hk
---
So someone can’t use the same meme video as someone else? He has the same video, but his title is completely different but stands true.
---
oof i feel bad bro, earn that money back
---
well i had no reaction when i saw it, so its meh to me. i just appreciate high effort stuff.  i dont know about you :)
---
How?
---
Push bo in that map is easy
---
Me refreshing the page every minute🤣
---
Same

Also i feel like it majorly copied gungeon with a small minority of characters like the girl withe the yellow scarf and a frwking grey top

What the hell brawl stars

Wow I remember playing with someone in the boxing the world clan and they were level one and at 5000 trophies, thats hilarious

wow ,awesome

Why does a mod get  downvoted?

Great

This hurts my eyes

I can dodge it all day, you will never catch me!

Shh, relax

That not ness, that’s noss, there is a slight difference that makes it recognisable

Awesome 🥳

Update is out now!
---
No, it isn't
---
r/wholesomebrawlstars
---
ikr this zekro guys is just a kid who has like 1k trophies
---
As soon as we see his dumbass use a second super, we turn to go fight. You can see us both do a two step....and if you listen closely, you can hear both of us say “el effing primo”
---
Honestly needed this, thanks man
---
Tbh my big is like a mii in win sports
---
My friend just made 1000 trophies and IMMEDIATELY got Tara!! I have 4K+ trophies and i only have 1 mythic( he has gene as well)
---
People could just turn of their wifi/data when they are losing
---
Flair doesn't check out
---
Ususally siege with randoms above 400+ is straight up loss
---
^ I knew I wasn't the only
---
Crow Gang asks why are we getting ours last...
---
Sure, some bushes next to me, a Nita hiding from me in another bush, a spinny boi searching for some boxes... Ah, exactly like home...
---
Wait what how do you get trophies without WINNING???? Solo showdown only???
---
That'd be interesting. Ice cream explosions.
---
 150 gems?
---
UwU
---
He got nerfed so many times because he could kill other players...
---
Not like he is an assassin or something...
---
-test-
---
r/nice
---
Alright, if it is tomorrow, then you owe me. But if it isn’t, then I owe you.
---
i saw this type of comment everywhere and its kinda scary tbh umu
---
Lmao cavern churn sucked balls. Angry bulls in the bushes, shellys with their supers, barley spamming, dynamike spamming, bo's with their star powers teaming in the middle and ricos using angles to shoot you. When you crossed the 400 barrier this map was a nightmare
---
True
---
Oh yeah, tusk body, and KQ powers he is S tier jojo reference
---
Your post has been removed, make sure to use the body of a post to elaborate on the title.
---
You are in the wrong community
---
hahaha I was gonna comment the same lol.
---
Yup
---
Mi ricorda una settimana prima del globale, quando hanno messo la grafica 3D non ancora ottimizzata e il gioco si freezava per tutti quando usavi la super di Barley😂
---
Looks great tam! Keep it up
---
They're the same picture!
---
true
---
Someone invites you into their game and starts a duo showdown.
---
If you're nothing without ~~the suit~~ cavern churn then you don't deserve ~~the suit~~ Cavern churn
---
Exactly
---
Most of the new maps are just trash that i wont even collect my tokens on showdown, like eye of the storm
---
https://youtu.be/XB490ZBQKuQ
---
Here you go
---
Well rip me since I only have Piper’s and Jessie’s star power and their new ones seem to be shocky and snappy snipping so they’ll be at the end
---
Or maybe it'll be in August lol.
---
Nice!
---
Cool And good line
---
10th time i see this this ain't a free karma shop
---
Well i didnt think this throught
---
12k+ GANG RISE UP!
---
Shelly's not op! She's not so versatile like Leon...
---
well today i pushed rico with a 100 trophies....so theres that
---
I don’t have any brawler at 400 so i guess that’s why Siege is easy
---
I prefer the spike art
---
Master builder obv, but the bird is quite smart too
---
supercell: nice but i think we need another brock skin
---
I have no words except that you are a magician and I'm trash
---
The Left one.
---
Wait we can do that if they don't have the event?
---
Means he's commenting and upvoting to get it higher in the feed, so more people will see it and hopefully answer.
---
use code wonderbrad lmao
---
People don't wanna risk and get together and make a nice comp or even go in comms
---
Shes just mad that she got *out- T H I C C E D*
---
If you open the boxes when you get tick, you can still get gems
---
Same lol
---
I like eye of the storm with Daryl but most of the maps have no interesting element like I can’t even remember the names to any of them because I don’t care for them
---
He didn't made for this , He made to be like a guy that rides a hoverboard and walk across the water , But they changed this because they haden't enought time to balance it
---
havin a good time?😂
---
I play siege for fun (Cause I win 70% of the time.)
---
Long time ago brawl stars was called slug fest and it was a space game but this concept was changed to wild west. This sound is one of some sounds from alpha. Nothing special
---
League of sexual harassment! I love it!
---
His wife left him
---
Did you check
---
Exactly. Acoustic bass guitar.  How someone could know a ukelele and not know a bass guitar,  I have no clue
---
Tara does NOT need a voice. What she needs is a remodel.
---
Okay lOl
---
Eh, You Can't Really Tell Who the Girl Is?
---
Does'nt Rly Look Like Penny T_T
---
I've gone from ~6500 to 8100 in about the last two weeks, because my club started to get serious about cup requirements and keeps increasing the minimum requirement which is lighting a fire under me to actually push. And the current requirement is 8500, so I still got a little bit to go.
---
That's true
---
It's yo boi Spammy Miney
---
Being 10k it's not same as it was in beta with all these new Brawlers. 
---
10k is no longer a big thing bc of that so don't expect ppl to be crazy good or something
---
So cute
---
I think there will be more newer mythic brawler, since we have the last red color(which is mythic brawler) at the week 9. Did they plan to surprise us? OMG can't wait!!
---
Where’s the update at
---
150 gems? EASY! ~ OJ
---
Don't save them up. Open them as you get them.  That's what I did and unlocked every brawler (non tr) by like 3-4k trophies
---
IN THE ROUND ABOUT
---
I didn't know accounts could be banned.
---
try better next time kid
---
YES
---
Where’s the tenth brawler
---
this is so true
---
Yeah that’s the meme
---
Tbh, very satisfying to watch box openings
---
When the tick updates drops im aboutta push my mortis to 500 lmao
---
It did, and it was painful. Thanks.
---
No, no, no... That is THICCCCCCCCC
---
Not that, Rico was op on it.
---
Mad? This is a discussion, have some dignity. Lets take a look at your comment piece by incorrect piece.
---
Awful controls? Any proof of this or? Look at Fortnite, mobile players have no query there so maybe you’re just “mad”. That game is easily 100x’s harder on a smartphone than brawl stars using the same ”awful” joystick.
---
You call it a “game mechanic” yet that doesn’t excuse it’s overpoweredness. It’s like calling an exploit a “mechanic” cause it’s part of the game (weak argument).
---
Characters aren’t “based” on anything. Autoaim is easier to use with say, shotgunners, but they don’t depend on it (look at daryl and Shelly). If anything, you’d need to clean up your aim if you feel you’re missing shots. Don’t blame your tools if you can’t even use them.
---
If you use autoaim with Mortis then that might be why you’re on the lower end of the trophy range. 
---
You contradict yourself by saying he can’t approach, that reason being autoaim (thanks for countering yourself, I don’t have to now).
---
Of course Mortis requires skill, but 1v1 a Bull in the open and see what happens; death every time. That’s not how counters work, that’s incredibly unbalanced.
---
I’m  trying to see your point, but I’m not convinced I should be using something in the game that I’d get banned for using in other games because it’s an aimbot by definition. 
---
It’s a lack of skill and not fun on the giving and receiving end. Sorry.
---
it’s a placeholder, they won’t keep it as spike’s super. So no, they aren’t running out of ideas so they reused spike’s super.
---
Nah, we gotta have transformer Bo, that skin is much better
---
It seemed a lot funnier when I first thought of it. While I was editing it, I realised it wasn't *as* funny. However, I spent a lot of time editing, so I still finished it.
---
Damn this was quick
---
Make this better include Shelly and bo lol
---
I love being 7k :)
---
# C O N T E N T
---
It was 3 times f respect
---
What if we already are at 500 will we get the points?
---
Yayy my favourite game developed by my favourite game team has updated!!! I love you guys so muuuuch!!!!!
---
MEME 👏 REVIEW 👏
---
Ok mods, please do your job
---
You could add condiments like ketchup on his head for the flower
---
Yes Frank said it
---
Uhh, luckily don’t became so weird as Rico
---
Damn a actual well though out comment yeah this was just a "Beta" of the teir list a way better one will come out when tick is released
---
I'm sorry, it was an accident. I had some issues with an editing app. I hope you understand.
---
What about the 3 star powers every month? So we would still another 3 by the end of July ? (If the update releases in a couple of days)
---
She only needs a small buff now
---
Congrats! :)
---
No-
---
"Bull comes and kills me"
---
Yeah spikes is way too weak. Carl and Darryl's current star powers are irreplaceable imo. 
---
Shelly seems most unique bc it makes u choose between pure offense or a mixture of offense and defense.
---
Crows seems wayyyy too overpowered
---
Legendary
---
she sounds like someone getting strangled in water
---
They are adding cavern churn back pog
---
As a member of the Mortis gang, I do not approve of this change. /s
---
I wonder if he’ll be overpowered, like the typical new brawler
---
Today is a good day men.
---
I do not care about what one person says Ill take what a majority of people have to say thanks though
---
I cant wait for his release, showdown will be hilarious with only ticks trying to hit eachother from the distance
---
THANK YALL FOR THE AMAZING UPDATES!
---
You are breathtaking!
---
Yea that would have been better!
---
Saved
---
Eww gross leon
---
Well yes but actually no
---
She sounds like a great fairy from Zelda: Breath of the Wild
---
Darryl super charges every 30 sec let that sink in.
---
That sp can probably restore you to full health 3 times or more per sd game, and probably way more in 3v3 (not as useful cause dying is not bas in 3v3 but still)
---
Tara is getting VO + Remodel !!!
---
I made im bald on purpose,he is more cursed like this
---
i have 900 penny powerpints and 700 dyna power points and 400 bull powerpoints. all lvl 6
---
btw
---
Well he'll just... Wait...
---
well, fuck! time to make a thousand petitions for supercell to leave her voiceless as it fits her character
---
Yo, how many Mortis are in this chat?!
---
Ryan Frank and all the other members of the Brawl Stars team I just wanna say, I love you and thank you for making this game as fun as it is!
---
Yeah, he’ll definitely be OP for a while, so we gotta take advantage of that.
---
Yesn’t
---
Yeah. I took that picture last night.
---
Almost as quick as the trophies we'll be getting
---
Thank God its releasing in 8th week after update, so those with piper below pw9 can get her there
---
Here is 14:43 :v
---
That eye looks stupid
---
the update on the app store says they’ll be adding tick rn so yeah it’s 100% tick
---
First time on this reddit?
---
Cavern Churn is back lol
---
Unfortunately, it means going back to playing on my main account, I was trying to max Rosa quick on my mini first
---
HOLY SHIT WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT MONSTROSITY, GO BACK, FUCK GO BACK
---
The only time when tnt is used
---
It seems really good for sure, last 2 updates were kinda trash.
---
There you go, remodeled
---
Is this real sir
---
Tara : Just need a new remodel
---
Supercell : if we hit 100m subcribers in Youtube we will give you one
---
WE love YOU.
---
Well i updated so when maintence’s over i can start directly
---
Its not as good as you think. The whole thing depends on you know.. actually hitting shots consistently. If u cant do that, which majority of players cant, then doesnt matter.
---
Her current star power , however, is better because its straight up more damage per shot
---
Omg I'm happier than a baby swimming in a pool of sweets
---
Blasphemy!!!!!!
---
I do cuz I find it fun. Just wish Heist and Seige would have their own section and Brawl ball and Bounty would have theirs. Would allow there to be a gamemode that requires a score and one that has a building to be active everyday
---
Tick's mines explode after a short delay, said in the Brawl talk, making this may-may inaccurate.
---
And... Cavern churn is coming back
---
MY EARS WHAT THE
---
IM GONNA DO A REPOST  IF  POST BECOMES UNDERRATED
---
Absolutely ! I already downloaded!!!
---
A common meme but still decide to post it 😞
---
But her voice is like ghost from minecraft
---
Tara is getting VO and remodel IT'S HAPPENING
---
Aaaaaaaahhhh thats hot
---
It sucks wtf
---
No.
---
Yeah i think they were too excited while making echo in her voice.
---
Im afraid to play with her now.
---
yea
---
Oof, I don’t have a mini
---
Or this update
---
Nope he’s playing a Bass
---
This that real
---
I KNEW A TARA REMODEL WOULD SUCK BUT NOOOOOO YOU ALL WANTED IT
---
Well, keep in mind this update is supposed to fill the next month since the Finland members of the team are taking vacations.
---
*Power Of Neo Playing*
---
Damn this was a hella nice update if I've seen one
---
I was playing colt at 703 trophies earlier today in heist with randoms and got matched with a jessie on my team who had 408 trophies and threw... would have reported them and been confused with matchmaking lmao
---
The first time, he only had one gem and we weren’t in countdown mode yet.
---
oh gawd he comin
---
hell yeah
---
You are brathtaking
---
how
---
Wait a minute... 
---
TICK DOESNT HAVE A SECOND SP WTF!!??
---
Does maintenance breaks mean it's going to update?
---
So if you have a rank 20 brawler but at the moment it happens to be below 500, do you still get the 300 star points because it reached rank 20 previously?
---
She also got a voice :D
---
yup
---
please somebody answer :|  i can't even talk to real human in help &amp; support page  
---
all i get is some stupid recommendation
---
Almost nothing changed, and the eye looks better, also has voice, post downvoted
---
Yub, check it again.
---
What happened to the season rewards ?
---
Just star points
---
Couldn't agree more
---
Yeah, I see what happened. I got too excited reading the new star powers and stopped scrolling. Thanks again
---
It's an ukulele
---
She has voice :P
---
I’ll be the rooooooundabout
---
XD Nice
---
let's hope they fix it soon :'(
---
look at the ball
---
my first post!
---
No
---
Only ogs remember
---
I named mine Gourdon And David
---
Wow that was fast🥴
---
I've got 6000 and I have 3 500 brawlers and am at 6920 trophies
---
shhh
---
Ugh facepalm I didn't even know Bull got a new skin
---
THE ONE THING WHAT MAKES THIS UPDATE 50% BETTER THAN OTHERS IS TARA REMODEL! I LOVE YOU SUPERCELL!!+!
---
Ohhhhhh
---
Ok, this is epic.
---
This post was made by players who dont like infinite darryl roll gang (darryl ftw)
---
Best brawler model so far, even better than Phoenix crow I could say
---
You just choose which star power you want to use, go to your Shelly and click on the SP, and choose which one you want to use(if you have both)
---
Tara is a very solid control brawler. She has one of the best supers in the game imo.
---
If you guys are having trouble pushing her, I suggest using her to chip instead of playing aggro and don't waste shots as she has a slightly longer reload time. Try getting combo shots and take advantage of her ability to hit through targets.
---
Good luck brawling!
---
All 3 in the shop :)
---
better than make she fat
---
and her voice is scary
---
Are we not gonna talk about that auto aim right there
---
❤️
---
Nah but seriously this was annoying as hell
---
How much?
---
How you got it?
---
i’m ashamed of myself
---
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
---
It’s ok we’re all guilty of this one lol
---
Restart the game and should be all right...it worked for me
---
I got the blue bull and night mecha crow
---
Thanks for the advice! I'll definitely try that in my next Showdown match 😀
---
Siege is quite enjoyable if you're used to playing MOBAs. It is more strategic than the other modes, at the expense of being slightly more team dependent, but still infinitely less salty than actual MOBAs.
---
Everyone has the same offer?
---
3vs3 Ticks in Brawl Ball and Gem Grab is the most fun I've had playing Brawl Stars in a while
---
ww2 mines camp footage (1945 colorized)
---
I really want to buy that now...but nah I'll wait for it out of a Brawl Box. No point wasting gems o something I'll get for free eventually
---
Id like to know also
---
I got all 3 from 4 big boxes so the odds seem to be pretty high
---
You don't like her new look?
---
but she didn't too much just like colt and poco
---
you mean jessie?😂😂
---
WOOW THATS AWESOME MAN!
---
Shongagaggagagallerelrlanrelelan 
---
( Tick's voice acting )
---
Barley is amazing in siege. Dynamike as well
---
She didn't when I uploaded this.
---
I dont even have star shop :/
---
No god please no noooooooo
---
I got 5.5k, at 7.5k trophies, 0 brawlers at 500
---
Wow, that's more like it
---
when you realize you didnt read what's new
---
Cavern Churn is back!!!
---
What is bad?
---
And a little bit of a voice ?!
---
Lmao who actually reads those ?
---
feels like my iq drops 100 when i play shelly
---
It used to be even but now a whole new row had to start
---
Accurate as all hell.
---
I don’t know but i tried to fix it.That is what i know.
---
first time ?
---
I want Leon soooo much that I can't live without him
---
Im +5k and i opened my about 130 boxes to upgrade him , And everything i just got is level 3
---
Nah, I’m *pretty* sure it’s “canon”
---
She's has the best brawler model sofar, the animation and everything is on point 👌
---
this. Is. AMAZING! Good job SC! You made me really happy, cheers to your dev team!
---
It must be a bug
---
I had a fun one on that heist map to start off too. Had us down at 38% they were at 67%. We pushed with 20 seconds left and I hit a bomb on their box last second to get them to 37% and win. Really good heist map
---
6 months,1.7k trophy losses
---
You will be the MOST BREATHTAKING developers if you design a skin for Leon. Please I am bored sith the classic Leon.
---
who wants to know what is new😂😂😂
---
did you know they put back cavern churn?
---
Had a Rosa in my solo game a while ago. Son of a bitch was annoying.
---
Tick star power will have a similar effect, you'll start the life regen 1.5 seconds faster.
---
7500 star points. 0 brawlers at 500 (but 25 brawlers at 400+)
---
I got 5300 star points right when I got on the game
---
It is
---
And i think you Get 300 for 20
---
Yeah but I think as of right now early game Brawl Stars can sometimes get extremely stale
---
They’re fixing it they posted on Twitter don’t worry 
---
You’ll get your points mate 👍🏻
---
How do you feel about Crow's?  I need to do some math.  Doesn't seem as ridic as Shelly's at face value.
---
Did bibi just say mr.bat wants to play ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
I am as happy as you about the trophies changes! 
---
Before this update when 3v3  is +5 -5 . I was too afraid to lost trophies in 3v3, so I have no choice but play Showdown all the time. Now 300-399 trophies brawler will only lost 3 trophies, it’s so great. I think I will give it a try to play 3v3 a lot more often than before! :D
---
Relatable
---
Me too I got 5300 and my highest rank 16 (I'm at 6670)
---
Probably a bug that came wirh the update
---
I didnt get my star points
---
JensvL98 is your name and answers is your game. Good job.
---
No youre not thr only one! Theyre getting it fixed god damn stop spamming
---
The matchmaking algorithm tries to get the minimum possible amount of a single brawler in a team, so it takes a lot of time to realise that there's only one brawler being played
---
Cavern Churn just got added back with the new update!
---
"Passage" is now gone.
---
Automa-tick 
---
More like Automa-thicc
---
Thanks, buddy!   
---
We do have some issues with this update and we still want to see how Tick performs in matches... But we are working on that! :)  
---
For the next time you are thinking about quitting the game, just give us time. We love Brawl as much as the players and every problem you experience, we experience ourselves. So if something is not fun enough, let us know and give us time to fix it! :)
---
I didnt even get my star points, while i do have several 500+ brawlers
---
OMG.I WISH FOR THAT.
---
like 2 hours ago, it’s out
---
Within 24 hour you will get them. I have the same.problem, at least I get 15,300 star points
---
Ahh that would make sense if they release it all at once.
---
‏‏‎
---
I know that already
---
OH SHIT
---
Must’ve been some kind of error on supercell’s per
---
Oof
---
Shelly’s new star power in big game
---
you have a problem with that?
---
Me too probably we ll just have to wait
---
Sad to know they changed my girl
---
Fucj
---
Stop posting these kinds of posts. No one cares. It's the Rosa update all over again.
---
This.  New Model looks Teeny.   Hate it
---
This update is just as good as how Ryan looks on the brawl talks
---
This is the content we need.
---
The Supercell team is trying their best to fix the problem within 24 hours
---
Well cavern churn is back
---
His accent is a little *ticc* but still understandable.
---
I've got this too but they said that they will fix this in 24 h
---
Looks good
---
Not sure about her voice
---
My least favorite voice in the game BUT I mean, They tried their best
---
I'll be back.
---
thank you for commenting
---
Apparently it’s a widespread bug, sorry dude and/or dudette
---
I also have this problem!
---
What the heck, Supercell?
---
His name is Tick
---
I noticed this too. It lost the match for me
---
FML
---
Well, good to know.
---
Just doing my best to clean up the trash here
---
Same . I'm at 10,000 trophies and got none
---
I was fine with the old model, but I think the redesign suits her, and we'll just have to get used to it. From a design perspective, it's more pleasant to look at and it just seems to be of a higher quality.
---
I hate it
---
Yea same for me
---
same
---
This new brawler is annoying like the heel
---
Within 24 hours you get them, read sub first...
---
Nah
---
I did it in 42 seconds..
---
Right!
---
I think the best thing for the game would be more club related activities that people of all trophy levels can participate in so that everyone has extra stuff to do
---
I unlocked carls.and shellys new sp
---
Not disabled its just bugged
---
So if its below no star points ?
---
Seen it in 30 seconds tho
---
It looks like those paint frames in haunted houses/mansions that move their eyes
---
Yea, everyone’s different. I got Outlaw Colt and Gold Mecha Crow
---
Thanks now I have nightmares
---
There are no death only a change of worlds
---
And we can't buy robot skins for crow and bo? I thought they said it was 150 gens
---
Indeed
---
Just browse hot instead of new or another subreddit altogether. Nobody is benefiting from you harassing people on their posts in new.
---
Nah Imo, its cuter 
---
I like cite models like carl an spike
---
Bruh we have known for 3 hrs stop posting this
---
Same with my two friends
---
it's from paul's twitter
---
Literally my thought process
---
It’s u/ryan_supercell
---
I just played a game where they didn't do anything. I guess it's a new bug
---
Thank You😊
---
Repost
---
100+ damage to each dagger means +300 damage and i think it's balanced. It pumps base damage real good and you act as finisher.
---
I hope it doesn't add the damage to poison ticks tho, that would break the game: 200x5=1000+(3-9 dagger damage) means a f ton of damage.
---
Gems
---
I totally agree, that's a perfect list
---
Correct
---
Ok thnx
---
Well, the gonna delete
---
Cancer
---
Skins can only be bought when they show up in the shop. They'll cycle through eventually
---
But I loved Bridge Too Far...
---
thank you! ❤️
---
I feel you bro
---
Just wait for a sale
---
Population: Tick.
---
That's so true
---
Removed - You have a negative karma score, please fix this before posting again. This action is to prevent spam on the subreddit.
---
I believe in this.
---
And i was going to get colt
---
I like the old one better tbh
---
Pretty sure you only get one at a time but I’m not sure if you get to choose or you get acrappy one and have to stick with it
---
Honestly Nita on heist is just good in general. Her other star power allowed her to heal constantly while battling the other team. 
---
Which, of course, healed her bear in return.
---
I can't walk a single centimeter without facing a mine
---
Fk this guy
---
You get starpoints now but unfortunately only if you have a brawler at 500.
---
The Poco loco.
---
The heal is good for 1 on one fights or destroying the vault with out taking damage Nita has the 2 best star powers lmao
---
I liked the old Tara better tbh
---
Rip siege F
---
I doubt you would get a choice if you don't unlock them simultaneously. That sucks if that's true though
---
SCP-096
---
I saved them so I could power Tick up a bit.
---
Community has made so many Holidays Poco skins so supercell is giving us ablaugha
---
Leons are big traitors, I also dont trust Shellys and Bulls.
---
UPDATE.
---
You get star points evey 10 rank 15 and 20
---
This would be too exploitable. Although us honest players would love to see this, it will never happen.
---
It hapends to me too
---
I swear, to me it sounds like all of Tick's voice lines are in reverse
---
well yeah...I bought Leon with gems and finally Crow was in a box...I now have them all lol
---
Gone, reduced to atoms
---
Stupid xd
---
Oh wow good eye ... that's a pretty big bummer!
---
So seasons are really only for people with brawlers over 500, then? Glad they made that easier to get to, I guess.
---
All of the audio are from jojo
---
Shop is not showing images
---
This update is way too big
---
No they are not limited time. They're releasing 3 new star powers each week over summer.
---
Ok, but that's why I said "Update day, in a nutshell" if you read the title
---
Except this new Star Power lets her bear do INSANE DAMAGE, left alone, the bear can perhaps destroy the safe faster then Carl with walls.
---
Dont stress about it too much. Snowflakes are everywhere. They'll eventually find a safe space to cry it out in.
---
Did you kill him-white crow
---
What did it cost?-pheonix crow
---
Me 5500 but spent 500 to buy outlaw Colt. I like him so much. The other One was mecha Bo but It costs 50000 unfortunately
---
OOF
---
Ohh yeah, not sure about that. I guess they removed it, which is unfortunate :(
---
I having same problem too
---
What does that title even mean lol
---
Me too but i spent 500
---
*Benis
---
I liked the old “painted” eye more, but the current one moves so I’m okay with it.
---
There is no point on writing your ID
---
They have already said they will be giving them the next 24 hours
---
Oh no, I done goofed
---
It was literally on the patch notes
---
Get him from boxes, obviously
---
Brawl stars tweeted that in 24 hours it should be fixed or something like that
---
What
---
It said that to me too and I have 3 brawlers to 500
---
They are now only available in item shop rotations like in BR games
---
tnx
---
Changing my name to this then
---
Same with Bo
---
The thing is bugged , It says i Lost 292 trophies and 8 Power levels
---
Ik that but it’s hard to do
---
A really fun map tbh
---
/u/unphiltered4lide give this man a award wish people were more smart like this
---
Guess what
---
(you know)
---
thank you so much ❤️
---
Well the jokes on u: I don't read, I observe!
---
How far did you get before winning and having to restart?
---
Hahahahaha
---
Speech 100
---
thank you, Brawl Boiii 
---
one of my biggest fans ❤️
---
This sign won’t stop me because I can’t read
---
It will be fixed tommorow don't wory they confirmed on twitter
---
Smh should have been mortis
---
THE BEST THING IS THAT CAVERN CHURN IS BAACK!!!!! 
---
T H I C C O, are you ready?
---
Are you really complaining about them adding  more Star Powers? They’ve been adding new brawlers for a few months now, none of which are difficult to get, and you’re criticizing them for adding more end game content?
---
this is easier if u have leon
---
😭😭😭 ain't that the goal huhu much love
---
She totally didn't get a voice right after I posted this. Right?
---
wow, Tara makes ghost moans
---
Oh thanks very much
---
Little boy
---
yesss. I was playing then i saw on my screen maintenance break and i was like OMG could it be the one with tick? I went on youtube and saw coach cory's video on the summer update and soon checks brawl stars again then BOOM! UPDATE!! I was so happy! :))))
---
thank you!!!
---
Every game, its always like this. You can’t even step in to take a gem 😅
---
It's not he has piper above 500
---
You're welcome
---
Me. I kinda like it but i can totally understand why so many people hating this game mode
---
I am not complaining LMAO
---
I HAVE all brawler maxed and just need coins to get to power 9 
---
Already hace 12 sp
---
I love the update 
---
When did i ever complain?
---
Very creative OP!
---
ohhh 🤔 nice interpretation! Never intended it to look that way but it's nice to know other views! thank you!!!
---
Remove post rn we don’t want them fixing this
---
😂
---
Respect man at 500+ trophies that ain’t easy
---
They are working on a fix for this. It’s in the pinned update post. Check that out.
---
Major bruh moment
---
I agree, he's boring, the last few brawlers they released have been boring tbh, bibi and rosa...
---
No, string is just a computing term, like boolean, the string is used in this case as the header for the brawlers name
---
f for bo, he turn american too much
---
i know 😀 that was 8 hours ago
---
OMG MY SUPER IDEA MADE IT IN!!! (or maybe it was just a coincidence...)
---
He needs a buff so he is even slightly usable at close range, and he needs a series of LARGE, LARGE NERFS IN ALL OTHER AREAS.
---
Content: Just stolen clips fromr reddit 
---
Most are credited tho
---
Maybe it'll be glitched like all the glitches today
---
I got 13,000 but couldn't use them, it's just a glitch everyone will get them withings 24 hours they've said, cant wait for mecha crow
---
Ok I understand now
---
~~When a soutg korean accidentally step on to north korea~~
---
Ticks will be the next dynamike, change my mind
---
Yeah, I imagine him being a drunk dad outside a baseball game throwing sticks at people
---
It's stickied right at the top three hours ago
---
What do you guys think* not how ahh
---
Thx for the info
---
Tick.
---
Is.  
---
So.  
---
ANNOYING.
---
you’re not the OP. What did you do to get 150 gems?
---
When you’re surrounded by 4 ticks
---
Shelly’s new star power is scary
---
You forgot to add the one maxed tick killing everyone in one shot
---
All that's left is Hoverboard guy and Hurricane for now
---
ok
---
Also Similar reward as 3v3s so NO MORE AVOIDING SIEGE TO KEEP MY TROPHIES YESSSSSS
---
1 event ticket ? That is crazy holy mother of gawd !
---
What’s his new star power?
---
Wow impressive!!! Congrats!!!
---
And now with the star points it is no longer a damn difficult challenge without rewards!
---
Haha i just got bo starpower
---
I actually just updated and the timer is there now.
---
But no seriously why dose she keep getting buffed so much
---
No bloody way, that must be a reference
---
It's gonna be fixed alright :) 
---
https://twitter.com/BrawlStars/status/1143967338938732545?s=20
---
[S] nanah we just need another shelly's super to one-shot that shelly boss. Because belueve me, the super can easily one-shot even a boss
---
Yeahhh justice
---
Awesome, time to rip open the rest then hopefully I get some 😂
---
haha same. i played siege only when i had a new brawler xD they really listened to us
---
#Tara is definitely a whale
---
##CONFIRMED
---
I do, it's a fun mode
---
BECAUSE THE GUN IS THE TURRETS' SON
---
Brawl Stats
---
When even the ball gets a skin before Tara
---
Sad times, people thinking battle passes are pay to win, last time I checked having an exclusive skin in brawlstars makes more people try and kill you. Pay to lose more like lol.
---
But when he attacks you hear way more than 4 strings
---
I did played siege everytime to get star token but was too scared because of loss
---
Well its bad for hardcore pushers tho
---
But they did chnage trophy inflation so.... yeah
---
Nothing it’s only good to flex if you want, because it would be exclusive for tryhards
---
Dude check my profile I recorded brawl ball with 6 ticks and it’s super nuts
---
It's basically trophy road, but you'd pay like £6 a month to get upgraded rewards and exclusive skins for reaching certain checkpoints.
---
He got a map added probably
---
Did you get the box?
---
Nah, I have this star power, it's not as op as it seems... The cool down is really long and when she gets it, it doesn't save her from fatal hits
---
Louis Sansi
---
I liked it, I just think they should darken the green of the eye a little and the "blue" that surrounds it
---
$100.00*
---
yeah but the op gpt his map added by winning Rey’s map contest.
---
I also agree but I think a battle pass would be nice, but now we have star points it's really not necessary, they've basically given us all a free battle pass to get exclusive skins by putting lots of time into the game.
---
Me too! Lol thank goodness because I didn't save any boxes.
---
The eye is pretty cool imo, I like how her eye probably makes the noises and not her and the noises are kinda similar to gene's, which kinda makes sense because they both look like they come from the same place
---
Firework
---
Who's next?
---
I don’t know how to feel about Tara’s voice.
---
He looks like the training cave bot
---
Why not make like cartoonish sound effect for spike. I mean he already is cartoonish.
---
Get those brawlers to rank 10 and 15!!! If you get 4 more brawlers to rank 15 you'll have enough! Good luck
---
They’re parasites. Search up ticks. Tick is also the name of the new brawler, but I’m pretty sure you already knew that.
---
Holy fuck i just realized
---
Amazon Fire hd8
---
more than twice i lost like 50 trophies because of a star token. so in the end i stopped even trying it and ruining my day. felt really bad when i had 9/10 but i was so "scared" i learned some patience too xD
---
Brock: you so lucky!
---
It is reduced to 1/4 health which is still a lot of health.
---
Actually Brawl Ball was introduced with the same update for Tara (and Pam) and when you get the ball it has a sound, so technically speaking, the Ball had a voice for about 1.5 years before Tara⚽️
---
