Smh why did this get so many downvotes, it‚Äôs clearly a joke

I see players running around in a showdown match.

*Guess I'm insane, then*

Yes! Thanks :)

not really looking for karma, also this joke is flaired as idea
---
The real problem ain‚Äôt that brawler it‚Äôs the matchmaking look at that Poco
---
I am at 492 with Crow (power 5), he doesn‚Äôt need a buff.
---
exactly lol

You should play with the other higher people there so you can push even more

If only Leon was enough to space out bull or if he actually had range so that he could chip down bull before bull can even hit him

Looks awesome, throwers OP

I love it for no reason

As he escaped out from the cave, he was immediately sucked back into the depths of the darkness. He soon realized he was pulled by Tara and fallen right into Bo‚Äôs collection of land mines. Legend says that he is still stuck there like a Dynamike hit by a Frank super, _but still no one knows_.

Match making is by trophies not power level

I played 3 games of Robo Rumble, with 20 tickets each time. I had 17 brawl boxes to open, but after I opened some of them the counter would go down by two instead of one. So if it said I had 5 brawl boxes, I would open one and then it would say I had 3 brawl boxes. I opened around 10 boxes total. I was not paying close attention to my coin count, so I don't know if I got the contents of the boxes that disappeared, but it seems like I did not.

Supercell wants to waste time in buffing Carl, so they can torture us by not buffing crow

dont buy mega boxes either. just spend gems on skins or(if you have lots of patience) when a legendary comes. you will get all mythics and below eventually, but legendaries are so rare that there's no guarantee

You can't say that Shelly is *objectively* the least fun brawler to play against because *objective* means that the statement is a fact, when it \[the statement\] is obviously an *opinion*. The correct word to use in this statement would be *subjective.*

This post was made by r/grammar_police

What band?

I think he was in my band at one point
---
alright that's funny
---
No it wasn‚Äôt it happened to me too someone sent you a team invite and you clicked that button and then your screen went completely black you clicked chat and all you could see was that so you closed out the game and re opend it
---
You sometimes have to just accept it
---
Awesome! I want to play with them some day

Haha nice

I feel so lucky that I have almost every brawler except crow lol, this is the only game I've ever been this lucky

She's 10 but, why is she so thicc? Genetic?

If they were worried about that they would borrow from the coc servers that save a million replays for no reason.

How did this happen

Gonna stun her for a long time

Yeah I‚Äôm gonna need a whole lot of backup

That‚Äôs what I think everyday on this subreddit. I saw one of my club members posting about the prevalence of Carl mains, and I‚Äôve also played in a match with Coach Cory.
---
I am half F2P, my mom allows me to purchase the 80 gems offer every month once, from today I will be saving them. Nice idea bro to save and buy legendaries also I have every brawler except leges

---
Yes there very good players.. just keep practising and I‚Äôm sure you will get noticed
---
It was just a glitch
---
Good idea but I don‚Äôt think the servers can handle it. I think if you make groups of threes within clans and let those groups fight other groups of a different clan for clan wars it would work a lot better.
---
I can't pull carl but since he's been released I've pulled Frank, piper, and gene so I guess I'm pretty happy. Also have spent zero money to get these people 
---
Where did you buy this skin?
---
Not a very fun one though
---
yea at 9k i meet someone with almost 11k name Prometheus. he in the clan the 9 circle assuming thats a good clan too bc everyone there high level asf with 11k trophy or more yet he use a mortis in heist and after we lost bc of him he came to my clan and said we were stupid and that we threw the match so yea retarted randoms ranges all the way to 11k  
---
Most ppl think it‚Äôs just endless ice, but there‚Äôs actually a lot of buildings and has a decent population

I like the barley Icon

Slurp, Darryl time!

I learned something new, that your chances do increase. I just got Leon yesterday with a 0.12%. Now it's around 0.06% for legendary
---
BETTER than the the UFO one
---
I honestly would rather play cavern churn than this map
---
This reminds me of that one spongebob episode

"Slowly" and his super is already strong so they will most likley nurf its damage a slight bit.

i got crow yesterday with legendary drop rate of .1200 and now it's .0678
---
Yesterday, a primo in my team does that same thing but the clock was on 1,so somehow won that game. 
---
What on earth is the source for this?
---
They patched it already
---
This is really beautiful! Supercell better add this into the game!
---
I‚Äòve died like 3 times because of this
---
I love it as always rio, would she shoot flowers as well?
---
That's how ~~mafia~~ riochann works
---
Then use bull and dominate the map. Have you heard that certain brawlers are good certain maps? 
---
M8, you can‚Äôt base balancing off of showdown. You just can‚Äôt!
---
I'm sure you'll get him soon enough
---
And Diablo Nemesis, i believe
---
Try: passage, scorched stone, thousand lakes, double trouble
---
Mainly general tips, I wouldn't say I'm that good at playing him, he's one of my favorite brawlers, have him at rank 15 currently. Maybe some good maps or gamemodes and maybe a few general tips? 
---
Useful tip of the day
---
No u
---
It's very, very rare nowadays
---
I don‚Äôt like to sink myself to their level
---
Hey bro how there is a ek primo with your name?? Plz tell me?
---
Every brawler is good if played right - gj xD
---
He needs to roll in a chair
---
He‚Äôs best on siege and heist. U can also use him on gem grab pretty well. Best heist map is forks out and u can play him on all siege maps
---
But Leon can prefure from a further range. 
---
‚ÄúBuT YoU‚ÄôRe a RaNdOm ToO‚Äù god I hate people who say that. You know the type of players that were talking about
---
Weve all been there
---
What the freak didn't like he pass 20,000 like 2 minutes ago
---
[removed]
---
No man it's so epic
---
There is no "level" you just don't like bull because you get killed by it... if thats gonna be your attitude then don't expect to get good at the game 
---
**oh no**
---
Adorable!
---
I was just say it as a joke .-.
---
So do you main Nita?
---
Nah I main barley
---
If anyone can use him and he requires no skill, then you should also use him
---
Why would you spend gems anyways? There are better eays to spend them.
---
Egdy Carl or Miner Leon? Anyways nice art!
---
Just post nothing and name it "Skin Concept-Gene 20 min after release"
---
This is  showbown map 
---
with the power of r/mortisgang he outrubs every brawler
---
Sounds dope thx for being supportive of my art i have plenty more art id love for u 2 check out and ill even scetch some ideas of ur new brawler ideasüòÄ
---
Guess Darryl is too T H I C C
---
Better than thousand islands
---
well then
---
Yes I think ALL Star Powers should be useful in ALL gamemodes. Unfortunately this is not the case for Gene's and Poco's Star Powers in Solo Showdown.
---
Franks do tend to walk forward when they've stunned someone so...
---
*confused noises*
---
Well I was joking but happy to help anyways good luck with your brawler designs
---
That's so true I just need Leon Crow and spike and  the box is just going to give me coins and tickets
---
That‚Äôs so accurate

It‚Äôs annoying when you‚Äôre losing and your opponents are stalling by doing this.
---
Its not a battle pass. If you are above 3000 trophies, you can get tokens as rewards when every season resets. ( the higher the trophies the more tokens) however all brawlers above 500 trophies will lose 50% of their trophies above 500 for example: 530---&gt;515, 600--&gt;550
---
A season is a trophy reset. Every brawler you have above 500 Trophies will receive 50% less trophies after the 500 mark. So let's say you had a brawler at 550 trophies. When the season resets, it'll go to 525, since half of 50 is 25.  
---
In addition, depending your league, you'll earn some tokens as well.
---
I got Carl from big box
---
i want!

Hes good but bad at the same time.

Hes very situational and hes very good in those situations

9 kills by Shelly4Win
---
why i read "spin" intead of "spelen"
---
No because he is only good in one mode, that isn't even competetive.
---
Send him to the ranch
---
He is good in one single mode.... and it is not even competetive. Other then showdown he os only useable in Heist and Bounty. If you ask an actual Pro they will tell you something similar.
---
Omega Flowey looking great
---
I got my SPIKE from this box LOLo

Barley is op rn lmao, low trophies confirmed.

Crows good but the meta for him is bad

Stop crying. Supercell doesn't have to take every  skin in the game. Yes Gedi skins for example are good but the game is still someone else vision. 
---
Seeing how his attack is similar to what Ahri/Sivir/Ekko has in league, it's interesting to consider what Riot Games has done with those champions in their game.  
---
Ahri: Riot once gave Ahri movespeed while she does not have her projectile with her(Ahri currently gets movespeed for hitting 2 spells instead.) she also has re-positioning tools and crowd control tools available to her.  
---
Possible takeaways - Give Carl movespeed after throwing pickaxe / hitting pickaxe. Maybe re-tap attack to call wrench back mid-attack.
---
Ekko: Ekko's projectile slows, travels faster and stays at max range for half a second. Ekko also has a re-positioning tool and some crowd control.
---
Possible takeaways - Give Carl's pickaxe a small slow so it's easier to land a return hit. Maybe give Carl's projectile a faster travel time but let it stay at max range for a second for Carl &amp; the opponent to re-position.  
---
Sivir: Sivir's projectile doesn't slow down or stop at max range, she also has faster movespeed upon hitting her spells (on top of her ult which also provides movespeed).  
---
Possible takeaways - Carl already has a ult that grants him movespeed, sivir's a different case because she can attack while her projectile is still in the air. Maybe give carl something to do while waiting for his pickaxe to fly back? Maybe movespeed on hit (same as Ahri's suggestion).
---
I need thiiiiis
---
Can I commission you to make 1 for Piper?
---
EEEEEELLLL PRIMOOOOOO
---
Imagine Crow with Tokoyami's abilities...
---
Piper is not a high skill brawler. In fact she she is one of the easiest brawler to use. Stay far and shoot thats all.
---
Yup and don't play mortis( before his rework) in other modes besides brawl ball
---
I got a yellow Mexican and a green background what does that mean?
---
I'm noob
---
looks like the red bird from angry birds
---
actually she has the slowest unload speed and you need to aim if there is a crow he could just doge all of your shots since her shots are narrow
---
100% no kill enemies üòÇ

You can get like 10 brawl boxes by the time you collect 10 star tokens for a big box 
---
Why not?
---
A really good player main-ing piper and bull can make it work. In heist and bounty respectively.

All the more crow needs a buff

If you count bushes as walls :/

That make sense but i feel he is fun to play.

That's a great idea for a name, thank ya :3

It was funny the 30th time, not it isn't anymore.

I think maybe if you reach 600 trophies with Poco

Usually struggling with low hp behind the top walls

He can attack over walls if he aim in the corner and walk to the side you're hiding. He just hit you when the pickaxe comes back to him
---
It's not a glitch
---
ravioli ravioli don't lewd the turret loli
---
Leon beats Bull on close range and he is good on longer range. Why? He is legendary. So rarity plays a role
---
Don't we all
---
Oh trust me teaming is worse with more players
---
This tilt so small I found his pp inside
---
Huh
---
I mean I love the look of the map but the problem is the amount of bushes
---
Nice one but those jumpads are kinda weird
---
It‚Äôs actually normal or just that his pickaxe has superpowers.

---
Mortis could use easy a reload buff but maybe he will be op at running away so I‚Äôd give him at least a super reload buff since it‚Äôs the only thing that can give you a chance with opponents that you can‚Äôt go too close.. 
---
Piper seems kinda ok.. maybe her super needs some kind of rework 
---
Wait, there's water?
---

---
BRB. Using imagination since no pic.
---
I agree man
---
What's her super
---
Higher pull rates from 0.01 to 0.1 is not much higher imo. (Don't know the actual numbers just picked some at random)
---
Healing crystals no Jk
---
Idk 
---
It‚Äôs because his super is pretty much useless in showdown so you have to only rely on your basic.. if he needs a buff is definitely not a damage one 
---
Not all people bud ;)
---
Been a while since I unlocked crow and I agree with OP.  He doesn‚Äôt need a buff. Everyone knows he‚Äôs excellent in SD. He‚Äôs really good in bounty and brawl ball (as a ball carrier). He is decent in gem grab, and underwhelming in heist/siege which is fine as each brawler have strengths and weaknesses. I don‚Äôt get it, why you guys wanted to make him excel in all game modes, Guess most people here like playing braindead characters and stuff. Just go stick with your Leons and Pams. Leave crow alone.
---
I didn't have issues pushing Bo to 500 now I do with Carl his shots are so easy to dodge 
---
They're called skillshots for a reason lol. Good luck aiming at somebody good at juking 
---
Very interesting, but the bushes may have to have some mechanics or there would be crazy exploits.

Lol üôÉ

Top players don‚Äôt push in showdown. The reason why is because it‚Äôs so slow to push. Generally showdown matches take 2m 45s from start to finish, and at high levels, you need to get top 3 in order to not lose trophies.

I opened 1 mega box, 5 big boxes, and 75 regular boxes and...nothing. Not 200 boxes but it's still a lot.
---
As a game dev myself, there's definitely something off with the RNG systems that end up in SuperCell games. Though they are in the business of making a lot of money so no reason to implement RNG systems that would feel more fair/logical to the player.

Buff pam and barley

#MAP IDEA
---
f2p‚Äôer myself and I am at 8k. I start playing since Global release (november)
---
no way
---
Um im at 7k and it is still pretty much instant
---
Id say average 
---
Can you do this for more maps please.

Fight for 6th place

https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/b26s58/new_map_idea_tictacbox/
---
Nice
---
Yes
---
Yeah, the worst is when you get stuck in a situation where you have to run away. If the blade is still out there/coming back...then it takes longer to get back to you...which makes being in a bad situation even worse because you have even less of a chance of counter-attacking.
---
And yet, play him in heist: stand on the enemy safe in the map over the weekend, stick your face into the box crate immediately next to the safe, and then enjoy unlimited rapid attacks for as long as you can stay alive to make them.
---
It because ur carl at low rank
---
Omg im in this match (not teaming im playing as shelly) i think they dont like me
---
Pretty lucky. 
---
Max Bo, with a Brock and Shelly. Gg
---
Probably not destroy rocks but the pickaxe should come back 2x as fast. It could maybe even do 1/2x the damage since in most cases hitting anything on the way back is often just luck.
---
Crow is good but he's harder to play correctly. You can't just braindead use him. Crow has to be used tactically and then he's very good. If u know how to use him them its a very good brawler.  
---
r/crowgang
---
Doesn‚Äôt feel fair playing with him, not now I mean, we‚Äôll wait for a right buff 
---
Why?
---
I would be offended but u can‚Äôt even spell so p*ss off mate
---
This map already exists.  It's called "Snake Prairie"
---
Thats just the beginning, when you are rank 20 on a brswler ans go solo everybody spins and sometimes there are all 10 people in 4 tile radius and you cant do shit
---
If only i got the cactus plant or the hoodie dude, hell even the bird guy
---
You can hop on the bandwagon but it‚Äôll happen eventually. Just have fun torturing people for the first 100 free trophies. I like to play him in gem grab.
---
Just you bud
---
because he is /heavyweight, if he have his super it can be a problem for you to survive(depends on the location of the map and the brawler you have)

me i got darryl then rico the day after and then tara the day after that at 2.5k trophies currnetly i am at 5.5k
---
Exactly, all of my brawlers are either level 6 or 7 and over 300 trophies and some are over 400. I always get matched with players who have max brawlers..
---
If you‚Äôre facing off against 4-5 other teamers I think having one other teammate is fair.

It‚Äôs an interesting idea but if no one has the capability to break walls on either team then throwers are by far way too OP. I hate maps that are only viable for less than half the roster.

He‚Äôs under powered and I‚Äôm so unlucky üòî

I think the 2 starting on the island should get 1-2 boxes there with them since starting there is a disadvantage

u didn't get Carl such a shame

I don't have any brawler in one month plan I want any legendary brawler pls send me

Am I the only one who really wants this as a SD map?

It‚Äôs like when your trying to master bate but you don‚Äôt have any toys. Desperate times call for desperate measures.

why is it upside down?

Lol actually ur the one dumb here since you Just Block ppl to "win"

Except when they team with Dynamikes...

No
---
No one thinks he sucks.But he needs a remodel.
---
Good job! I love the attention to detail!
---
5 that's it most of mine are below 10
---
Not excatly tho...i rmb i read some where you will be match with players that have similar trophies with ypu brawler as well as similar total trophy count
---
/Wait..
---
Shelly is becoming shameful her super is too strong! Could you get that nerf please? To One last thing: can you speed up the charging times of Mortis? Bye
---
She can charge her ult on long range or squezze you in cornees particularly if they are targeting you
---
Probably partially from season reset
---
Bro ,his spike and frank are less than 50 trophies, he needs advice for this brawlers, not a break lol

I got a star power which obviously didn't have a 1% drop rate. 200+ boxes then I got it. But it was bull soo

Yes, he is gonna nerf every brawler!
---
Nothing's changed
---
As someone with Leon but no carl or gene I can relate.
---
No, Austrian. ;)
---
When I'm playing Piper on cavern churn and I see another piper

So that mean you have 20 brawlers and that is actually possible to reach 10k, well if u push all your brawler to 500

Skin from angry crows
---
Ooooh man you don't know how poco fucks everyone in the gem grab... I got the most star players in this mode playin poco
---
I like it. The reason of this idea it's because the especial attack of Dinamike can breaks the walls. 
---
Carl seems to be a miner as Dinamike. 
---
God no. That‚Äôll just make Brawl Stars look like Fortnite and shit
---
that‚Äôs a real grind, i don‚Äôt play it that much cause mobile games aren‚Äôt superior to PC. really only play it when i‚Äôm extra bored
---
It was at global launch and before, If i remember correctly they made it based mostly on total in December/January now its total trophies at first place when finding match and brawler trophies second
---
Except if they listen to the fans they can guarantee good results as the one at the top of the sub are ones liked buy the community 
---
Exactly right but he needs 2 supers to cross
---
He doesnt even look Mexican like Poco. He should have said, " I got a Purple Aladdin looking dude".

That's definitely mi map like I write. It's a rework of them. You can find it, I post it last day

I‚Äôm pretty sure bb-8 is copy righted so this prob won‚Äôt happen but looks great 
---
Depends on what your definition of close is. For your first question, it‚Äôs probably because there are no enemy brawlers in sight at all. If it did ALWAYS shoot the closest enemy, even if there are none in sight it would be stupidly overpowered because it‚Äôs basically the same thing as Jessie‚Äôs homing bolt. Just use manual aim, it‚Äôs so much better.

I hate people who spin when they think they are going to win. And people who give up thinking we are going to lose.
---
Yesh
---
Thats totally true crow doesnt need a buff you cab hate on me as much as you want BUT YOU CANT CHANGE MY MIND
---
That sounds retarded tbh lmao
---
What can I say except you‚Äôre welcome

This is by far the stupidest petition I‚Äôve ever read. I get it that Bo pisses you off, but completely deleting a brawler? That‚Äôs ddlc on another level.

I was playing gem grab

It varies depending on map tbh. Usually it's the throwers huddling behind a wall.

Teaming is the issue here, and unfortunately doesn't seem like it'll be solved.

I pressed it but I'm focusing on my mini account recently so I might not log on to my main for a while

---
Well my name was frosty and my friend changed it to nibba slayer so idk what to do
---
Use the format correctly
---
What do you mean? I just watched someone got Brock Star Power and edited it 
---
Congrats, 5K and only 15 brawlers :) üíî
---
This is good for ranking up barley and dynamike
---
It‚Äôs still a step in the right direction. Even after they give what we wanted people still find a way to complain...
---
How??
---
*Quassan'*
---
THICC. EXE HAS STOPPED WORKING 
---
I like the way u tricked Pam by getting mega. Luck a lot
---
New meme template confirmed
---
That‚Äôs something a virgin would say, LIAR!
---
At least rank 15 it sounds better lol
---
No I don‚Äôt like this, Carl‚Äôs attack is unique and doing this will change him in a way that will change the strategy of his... you can bounce it off the wall and try to get in situations where you can do that exactly.
---
üëçüèª
---
Don't want to spam, just happy. Yes he has hat
---
nice post
---
Lmao dude üòÇüëå
---
It's worse when people actually think shelly is good in gem grab and bounty.
---
Yeah agreed.
---
Maybe someone got into your account and changed the name?
---
At least be thankful that it was only a 2-day ban.
---
If you are below rank 10 with el primo use him, if not take a thrower
---
Back in my day we had a good upgrade system!
---
I like it, we need mire 30 gem skins
---
lol
---
Slice and Dice!
---
Thank you

---
Ok, I agree that everyone is underestimated crow and exaggerating the need for a buff. But crow still needs a buff, just a very small one.
---
You survived üòÆ
---
What do you need im at anyones disposal
---
Yeah he judges based on purely how the skin differs, like panda Nita is just a remodel but it‚Äôs still an amazing remodel, I Like Shellie‚Äôs but if you have star Shelly I‚Äôd go with Nita 
---
This triggers Vietnam flashbacks
---
Jesus told us the truth, that matters
---
So satisfying
---
Like your work!
---
Could you do a pumpkin skin for Darryl? He could shoot pumpkin seeds. I think that would be real creative 
---
"Not normal" sounds accurate.
---
yeah i just posted the same thing twice but it was my first time using reddit, so i thought i did it wrong, then i     
---
re- posted it and deleted the first one... lol
---
There were over 30 gems in play at the end. WTF
---
Awesome game man
---
Lick my nuttZack
---
Yep the same happened but I used the single name change for *CumMachine again* üòé
---
I'm really fine üôÇ
---
emiya hours
---
At ‚Äòchange user flair‚Äô, on mobile you can find this in the upper right corner on r/brawlstars 
---
Nah I thk tara and penny ones are worse than Nita. Nita sp got nerve and it‚Äôs kinda useful if u use correctly 
---
Just played with a guy called Sickmyduck
---
Brock would be op. He could break the walls and snipe the safe from his ship
---
Wonder if that's any worse than the person I played with named BIGDICKN***ER (it wasn't censored but I don't feel comfortable typing that out)
---
God,is that you?
---
Fr tho
---
My rico is 234 now :(
---
Uhm what have I walked in on reddit I like it
---
###### ####
---
Oops, wht mode did u usually push him on? mayb wait until cavern churn before playing him unless u got a gd comp 
---
Nice editing!
---
I loce when that happens, it's just so fun lol
---
I hate 1 tile gaps on this map,  but this map cool! 
---
Like many arguments, there'll be kids who just report for no reason despite winning
---
Tara and Penny in Big Game shouldn't be compared to Nita lmao, both are garbage and Nita is slightly better. However the SP is pretty ok in every gamemode except all ticketed events.
---
Oh ok thank you.
---
Ye is good, I never played him at cavern churn tho, I pushed him mostly on brawlball. And a lil bit at bounty
---
 Outside island spawns get insta clapped when landing by shellys 
---
Wow you are really talented!
---
records?
---
Oh no...

---
Did you win?
---
# Bull be like
---
Mostly showdown, as I don‚Äôt like relying on randoms or setting up teams.
---
No there wasn‚Äôt gems can only got up to 29
---
I just ignore the big box‚Äôs existence entirely.
---
We shall call it "Leon's Place" cause damn there is gonna be a ton of them
---
Yah tara penny and Nita SP are not really useful (idc ticket event no trophies can be gained or lose) and it‚Äôs not hard for those brawler to reach 500 without their star power (unlike Darryl , mortis ) 
---
Maybe auto aim sends it to the distance of the brawler that auto aim locks onto. Unless it‚Äôs out of Carl‚Äôs range, which would just fly max distance and return.
---
I‚Äôm so sorry how dare I
---
He is balanced. If you think Leon should do more damage at long range, you are just bad at the game.
---
You should've kept away from the bush until you reloaded, from there you could've easily won.
---
Not saying you stole it, but I made this meme a few days ago. Look on my profile. 
---
They could always make a partnership with Disney dumbo.
---
Actually, I do, I just made a small grammatical error 
---
the sub is full of 12 yr olds that think this is creative and funny. same with leon memes, bush bull memes, spinning dynamike memes and so on. maybe kids dont get it the way we do as older people so i cant blame them....
---
No bc he already changed it
---
That‚Äôs why you bush check
---
Wait, that's illegal.
---
Lmao if anything Colt is underpowered. Get good noob
---
He should get a plague doctor skin
---
"wOW,tHat SuCks"
---
Most importantly who plays mortis in that map
---
Everyone has that idiotic teammate who won‚Äôt fall back and ends up getting knocked out.  I‚Äôm talking of the colt who decided to try and shoot down crow instead of hiding and regaining health.
---
You have accord.
---
üòî
---
Daaaaang...you should stick up for all black ppl and fight your friend. Just go in for the attack randomly(just like his random attack on your account) but explain why you doing it while your kicking his ass. 
---
And don‚Äôt ‚Äúlol‚Äù because, yeah :) 
---
I want the BIRD. B: buff I: crow R: Supercell D:plz
---
Thx! 
---
I don't have a creative brain so this is the first time I ever saw this and now I can't unsee it
---
What about Dynamikes's star power?
---
He mentioned *the skin*
---
The other day i get the green ball thing with trousers
---
That's why they are on war
---
That's why it would prevent teaming
---
25 actually but damn that‚Äôs tough
---
Bulldozer
---
1. 1 tile gaps.
---
2. No space for robos to spawn (only on top and on safe).
---
Why is the Shellie's teaming area so accurate
---
Lol u have a lot to learn (it gets even harder to gain trophies)
---
you should mention that it‚Äôs not yours
---
My too if this happened to me
---
Here is my seige map idea, I felt like there were too few map options currently.  https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/b51wxf/siege_map_idea_this_can_maybe_improve_the_map/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share     
---
Wowwww you amazing!!!
---
I had 4 countdown but thats my record
---
Dynamike: *laughs*
---
Too bad that users are not given an option to share this...
---
Personally I have Tara‚Äôs star power and it‚Äôs funny. It has also helped me on occasion like when I use my super in gem grab and the player doesn‚Äôt die but is really low it cleans them up. Nita‚Äôs SP seems sort of underwhelming to me but again I haven‚Äôt used it. Shelly and Bull basically negate the Tara SP though because it has low health and spawns on top of them.
---
Piper and piper
---
TARAAAAAAAAA
---
Yeah but with no back arch like that :)
---
Is it Carl? Lol
---
Honestly they should just prevent them from getting into a room together. 
---
Caaaaarl
---
I would play it 
---
Ok sorry won‚Äôt do it again
---
This map is so cool. Brawl stars has some pirate brawlers (Darryl and penny) but no pirate maps. I hope there will be some kind of pirate update where Darryl gets his voice and they add new pirate blocks kind of like the new city blocks in heist and dry season. I hope this map will be added to the game too
---
Did somebody say Snake Prairie except undiluted?
---
Yeah. I was like the second or third comment. Saw it on new. My bad
---
Nita has toes oh my god
---
What is the purple ironman challenge?
---
well if your name would of be zach suppercell would not ban you üëå
---
;)
---
But what about shovel man with top hat?
---
Sodium chloride
---
Also, I prefer the name ‚ÄúPirate‚Äôs Plunder‚Äù
---
I am interested in what supercell saidüòÇ
---
I hate teaming but if it‚Äôs against me a Leon...all morals are thrown outside my window. It‚Äôs either that or I throw my phone
---
I like the idea, but sometimes being afk isn't their fault. Trolling and stuff yes I see that, playing poorly... Well depends trophy count tbh
---
He really fun to play in showdown but hard to get higher that 5th or 4th
---
crap that was it, I was waiting for something to happen
---
#destruction 100
---
Oh Pam! lol funny you should mention that... check my newest post :p
---
If it‚Äôs against a Leon, I will team no matter wut
---
To what?
---
There will be a hidden score for each player, thumbs up gives them +1, thumbs down gives them -1. 
---
Players with high scores will be on teams with similar score players and low scores play with low scores.
---
If someone has an exceptionally negative score they should be looking for a ban.
---
To promote positivity and have people use this system, if everyone on a team upvotes each other, everyone on that team will gain bonus exp for that match.
---
ok but weird flex
---
I have 5400 where does that go
---
Personally I think that thousand lakes does more
---
Might be a grey area dude, living on the edge
---
Getting all trophie gaps, u can only have 4 options
---
He‚Äôs already great, y‚Äôall just suck w/ him
---
My first brawler that was rarer than super rare was Spike. I waited literally the entire month of March before getting a brawler and it was Cactus Man yay
---
You're basically getting 17 gold per gem. A power point is worth 2 gold.
---
I like that analogy
---
Not at all
---
That doesn't give you fucking trophies. The first match after the tutorial and the bot match is the first trophy match. However, it is possible that the guy has played before, but just hasn't won any games yet.
---
It's been years since the dynamike/Mortis war, when a Barley threw his final card - a super super... Only one has emerged from big box 101 reuniting with an old face in carlsworth and has since adapted to life out in the random queues.. a barren wasteland where no trophy survives.. But from seeing super franks to the ghoulish Mortises and various raiders who've fallen to their spinning addiction two things are certain.. her tools ain't for fools and **showdown... showdown never changes.
---
Hopefully if this happens we see more Star Wars themed skins for colt and such
---
excuse me, but are you going to finish that box?
---
Well, it's possible that he has played before. but just not won any matches yet.
---
I love that star power!! take my upvote 
---
Greenita
---
Yeetus deletus that fetus
---
The auto-aim fields
---
Says whom?
---
Cuz I'm trash 
---
When all you have to do is save boxes and you will get a super rare... with ease.
---
Agree.
---
By el primo still has to recharge his attacks. Carl‚Äôs is ready as soon as his last one is done. 
---
5000
---
Elaborate
---
Wheres the bird?
---
1 sin off
---
I‚Äôve seen this like five times and it haunts my dreams
---
Realistic* ending
---
Throwers instead of thrower
---
Spend $ and get the mythic brawler!!
