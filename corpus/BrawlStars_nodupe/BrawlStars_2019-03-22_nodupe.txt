oh I was saying it in my perspective cus I have all the power points except a few of leon and alot of genie

Yes, especially since they changed my color.

Cheers, good luck for you as well:)
---
i pick night witch mutis
---
u must be doing something wrong and this should be a given but dont try to play every brawler on 1 single showdown map, I have a fren that plays all his brawlers one 1 showdown map even though some maps are bad for some brawlers
---
Pam or Spike without a doubt.
---

---
They have always been strong, but for a while there have been at least 1 or 2 brawlers above them and the brawler in that top spot has changed between a variety of different brawlers throughout the game‚Äôs history like Crow, Colt, Rico, Darryl, Leon, Etc, but all of hem have been nerfed until Pam and spike were left.
---
They were strong, but they weren‚Äôt strong enough to be nerfed so they survived.
---
XD
---
Crow is good on the current map right? Cos I played him and didn't do too well
---
Dayum! Almost looks like a potential Crow Remodel
---
EpicüòÇüòÇ
---
Lol Yes
---
üòÇ
---
Dang he‚Äôs unlucky but the game is balanced imo and not really pay to win especially if you have the skill to overcome the difference, and the way to fix this is to fix match making and not put power 7s with power 1s and 2s
---
Yes you can hide in a bush or stay in the open(totally recommended)

I like how Dyna is telling us to enjoy his pufferfish spike sushi

Nice! I only have like 18 boxes, but hopefully I get him. Good luck on getting him tomorrow!

Thank you bot, very nice.

crow is decent on the current one but pam is the best

That is also true that really needs to be fixed

This is pretty epic my guy

Well idk why I take it serious,I just have a passion for the game

you should do this for tara

Darryl isn't really a tank anymore. His health isn't very good. You have to use him differently now, and is harder to master, unlike other tanks. You also have to use his super effectively. I think he is good in heist and sometimes showdown, maybe bounty. 
---
Is it just me or is that color of that gameplay weird af
---
When you start winning to much trophies this game stars to match bots on your game. It is so fucking annoying 
---
True, the same thing happend with Gene
---
But he wasn't teaming...
---
I do sometimes to because like it feels good to get rewards on the trophy roads
---
Here‚Äôs the thing... first of all the meme is dead, second of all it doesn‚Äôt make sense for the meme to be applied here
---
This captures like 90% of player‚Äôs strategies in Showdown. I know there‚Äôs nothing unfair about it, but god damn the scavenger type gameplay in that mode pisses me off lol.

1. I KNOW POINT 1, BUT SERIOUSLY, IN A GAME? And Most of us who don't spend (at least for me) are teens/tweens usually 12-15 whose parent's don't allow to spend money on the game! Though, I belong to a well-to-do family (Dad earns $3.5k/month and Mum $2k/month, and we are a family of 4 and have our own house (2) so no money wastage for renting, I'm nit saying there ain't anyone richer than us, a lot are but yea, we're not homeless, you may assume because I'm favoring F2P) but for my parents, spending over such things is a waste and when I ask them to cut it from my pocket money, they'd say rather buy something useful!  
---
2. For your point 2. That's what I'm talking, They should rather make games which cost money to download but have no additional benifits for P2W, or at least a little less! At least those who won't spend money just don't download the game and waste their time playing it in which they have a very big disadvantage! (In this point I'm referring more to CR not BS)
---
3. With my point 2, just make games which cost some bucks to download but don't give so much advantage to P2W, this include cosmetical changes as well! And you may say, If I can't pay money to buy gems then how to download a game which costs money, My paarents doesn't stop me from buying games, but from that but buying things in the game (gold, gems etc) as according to him If I can download the game for free and play it then why pay money for buying that!
---
4. As to your point 4. I have already cleared off to not give any advantage  wether cosmetical or for gameplay to P2W (maybe a little,A LITTLE) 
---
The Bigweld one, he mention about Jessie attack sound which means that mousy bot
---
I‚Äôve saved up 16, but I already know he‚Äôs gonna disappear faster than Leon using his super
---
Really wanted that skin
---
Wait till you level him up. All brawlers are weak at low power level. 
---
So much, but it's a pleasure 
---
icicle reminds me of Mei from overwatch 
---
I have 6 big boxes
---
Staged for karma?
---
There isn't a way. But if you are playing in a game room you can lock the boxes by pressing ready 
---
I think rather than making her suoer faster you should make it have a better kill chance. This would make her much more scary to go up to when she has her super, right now the bombs are just kind of hard too hit with cause its random and they dont do too much damage
---
The sunglasses look like eyebrows making him look like one sassy mofo

Meh, maybe 1/69

Jeez this is a mad lad

Your karma is gonna jump to like 30k if you get all brawlers done üí™üèºüí™üèº

Isn't Mortis a creature of the night? ITS DAYTIME.

I got boxes and gems ready to go

MORTIS GOT EXPOSED!
---
OK Bro jeez calm down its my first attempt.
---
But thx for the feedback anyway
---
Is this an actual reference the show did or just a coincedence
---
Instead of brawlers slipping after stepping on a peel, they could slip, fall and become stunned for a second
---
Please give your opinion on how well I did this (probably terribly), but this is definitely something most people have experienced.
---
Nah, I wouldn't touch the star power.
---
I agree on the super buff, though.

*Oh*~~no~~ *yes*

Mega first. If you get Carl in that box then open all your big boxes. If you had enough big boxes to max him out with power points then upgrade him to max and then open all your regular boxes. It doesn't matter what the box is, it will always be a 1% chance of getting a star power.
---
If you dont get Carl form the mega box then open all your regular boxes first. Once you finally get him star opening your big boxes 
---
I've seen it like 2 times :b

Removed - Your post is too short, please expand on your title.

No

We need this in the April update for sure 
---
It's okay, we all make mistakes. Just some general tips : One block gaps = big no-no. Diagonal fence posts (according to some random guy that made a guide) = also big no-no. Make sure there are a decent amount of walls, but don't make it difficult to walk around in. Anyways, sorry for the rude tone in my original comment. Have a pleasant day!
---
#Gotta flex 
---
I was on your team as well xD
---
This is the best Nita skin 
---
Maybe Gene‚Äôs main attack should pierce, but the split does not.
---
Pretty sick
---
Your chance goes up the more boxes you have but it's never guaranteed from any number of boxes. It's still a 1.2% or whatever it is per box. You might unlock him after 1 box, might unlock him after 5000.
---
Also, "islands" (areas that are surrounded by water, with no entrance) are also big no-nos, because certain brawlers can get stuck in them (if they want to, I guess).
---
I'm more worried about nerfing Pam than buffing a woman with a sniper that could break the game for the entire community

Oof, that means you're not at 3k. It won't affect you at all, but if you're at or above 3k, you get some tokens.
---
This seems a bit broken. You‚Äôd never be able to get stars in bounty, and presuming you keep your gems in gem grab, that‚Äôs just OP. And if you don‚Äôt, then what‚Äôs the point? Brawl ball would be super difficult to score in with every body being able to effectively teleport to their goal in a few seconds. All in all, just seems like a bad idea if you ask me.
---
Explain the bright green GRASS#
---
SuperCELL
---
Omg
---
That special offer mega box(49 gems) and special offer 2x token (19 gems)
---
Watermelon Darryl needs you
---
Yea, that'd be BETTER!
---
Respect
---
49 gem mega box has more value  
---
1000 extra tokens = 10 boxes = 5 gems/box  
---
Mega box = 10 boxes = 4.9 gems/box
---
Like it except for the one pad on the right side seems backwards. I like how it stops Darryl from being OP. 
---
It means Buff Crow
---
Leon cant even stay invisible that long üòÇ
---
I know but the super is what makes her lose theres nothing wrong with the attack that's why the reload low
---
Be cuz Your A Mortis, All Dynamikes And Harleys And Maybe Colts Will Team, Cuz You Can Kill Them Easily, Especially Dynamike Whose Bombs Are So Easy To Dodge, Nad That's How You Lose 7 Trophies Per Match And Also How I Got My Mortis To 400 - 211 Trophies :P
---
Yeah it's annoying when you almost drop your phone or something and grab it tightly and accidentaly open a big box instead of like brawl box which is a lot easier to get.. 
---
The chances of getting an star power from a box is 1%. So you just are unlucky (if you have everything max, you can just start buying them in the shop for 2k gold).
---
You got gene on the first draw is lucky. Legendary chances goes slighty up each time you dont get a brawler from boxes, but all other rarities have a fixed chance and mythic is like 0.25%.
---
You cant get power points for maxed brawlers, thats why you onl6 got gene's powerpoints till you maxed him out.
---
Each powerpoint gets converted into 2gold if you cant powerpoints for any brawler so if you used to get like 15 gold and 25pp,  then youll get 65 gold instead since you have everything max.
---
I‚Äôd rather buff her normal reload speed, decrease 0.3s, and keep the current star power. And I agree with the super change
---
Everyone spam tag the official brawl stars account
---
No.
---
Oh yes. Agree. Those are specials though and I assumed OP meant just the normal shop. But OP, he is 100% correct. If you see the 49 gem Mega Box and have the gems for it...do it(the current special I believe)!
---
Not only that... they say in game specifically that luck value ONLY affects legendary droprate, nothing else.

In the AMA, people asked the developers if there will be a glitch with Carl too (like gene). They said that they have tried out everything (even releasing Carl early..check kairos times' vid) and they even gave permission to YouTubers to play with Carl. So far, there were no glitches. Check out any YouTubers vid on Carl gameplay for the same.

I said what do you think about (the idea of) Supercell adding a way to change your name using gems. I never demanded anything.
---
Mafia boos!
---
Compare crow to Pam. Crow needs a slight buff tbh. You need to heavily outplay people to make crow decent. Pam shits on crow and is better than him in almost every mode and map.
---
Yup they're idiots xd. You're spot on

Yes You can see here!!\^\^

Thank you very much!!

Funny but staged 
---
That could be integrated in his star power. 
---
That being said, in the ama the dev team said crow was gonna get a redesign, maybe that includes a rework.
---
Sure! :D
---
I would too
---
No randomness please, if I see more randomnese or stun mechanics I swear to god I...
---
In new Creepy Harvest, when Mortis defeats a brawler, Mortis absorbs their life essence restoring his health by 1400, because Mortis is somehow a melee attacker, It is hard to see the projectile after dashing attacks, so I used Life Blood to defeat a brawler and capture a screenshot.
---
Thanks!! :D
---
will give my opinion about it and hope it gets fixed! :)
---
Ya but most heist maps are 
---
She shoots three supers in a row while you are level 28 el primo and you lose
---
Primo jump?
---
Brawl Stars are planning to make this a thing but I'm not sure if or when it will go through or not.
---
where did you get the 1.2096% from?
---
I mean he already is highest mobility. Plus give crow enough health to survive more than a couple shots from sharpshooter brawlers and you have a perfectly balanced character imo
---
Including that in his star power won't make him better at all levels. Poison stops heal so it seems logical to decrease active heal and it would increase his good matchups
---
Thanks 
---
:)
---
Basically if you spin and the other spin they'll literally put a lot of trust in each other. Some of them would make the first move and die for them. 
---
trap as in like a dart trap?  
---
or is it trap as in a boy pretending to be a girl?
---
Welcome ;)
---
Make Penny!
---
I also thought that but 50% would be better. If he negates all heal he will become too OP
---
Make the little island bigger? 
---
open 4 regular boxes
---
yeah no
---
Yaaa it rewind time
---
Why?
---
Can't even hit thrower if thrower kill gene first since gene need to hit infinite time to get ult
---
I got her to 500 and I am never touching her again lol
---
Don't question it. Just open them
---
Kairos gaming? Xd
---
I have like 60, hopefully the odds make it easier to get him. Hope you get him soon man!
---
Got a doubler...
---
I feel like in Bounty, Piper can be easily replaced by Brock. They both have essentially the same range, and Consistent A+ damage is much more important and reliable than inconsistent S tier damage. As of now, it just feels like why should I play Piper when Brock can do the same thing but more consistently? *Especially* in a competitive sense, the skill difference tends to plateau which leads to less room for easy max range shots for Piper. What she needs is some kind of rework that can allow her to differentiate herself from Brock, since if she stays the same, she'll just feel like the inferior brawlere
---
This is actually a really cool idea for players to have a purpose for going on the other side
---
Nice one!
---
r/BoGang 
---
Cavern Churn.
---
I have experience of a 11k trophy player ive pushed all my brawlers to 500+ and the thing is piper is really lacking compared to the rest of the brawlers her super is trash people can catch up to her most of the time and her starpower only gives +400 damage when shes im a bush thing is u shoot 3 times after that there will be more enemies comming towards u if not ur fighting agianst one brawler but with this new star power she would be able to hold them back a little stronger cause of her faster reload speed being able to shoot at more enemies leading to area control which is good in most gamemodes like gg also crow is so underrated hes amazing and u have to know that pams healing station can ruin most brawlers attacks etc: mortis, gene also tara if she hits 1 card it will be instantly healed

Mm, and I hated when auto-aim was added so that bull and primo took much less skill, and close quarter battles no longer had the added skill of dodging shotguns from Darryl/Bull/Shelly

What if I say I want a trophy road? Will I get a Legendary?

This is a very bad idea

Honestly, you need pretty high skill and coordination to win as a teamer 
---
The issue is that this star power wouldn't incentivize staying in the bush. You would just need to get in the bush to reload and go back to action. Besides, I'm not sure she needs a buff, except maybe damage and reliability of her super.

Matchmaking is based on trophy count, not power levels. If it were based on power levels, gemmers would never win any matches and people would lose incentive to spend money.

Knock knock knock knock!

Did somebody say "real power"?
---
Pretty interesting, but I think it's really similar to siege?
---
Do it for Bull too
---
These accounts were made for an esports event called 'Rage' and they all had carl before he was released.
---
Splat Stars
---
He didn't see it activated, there's no way of knowing when it ends (or if it has even started)
---
üòí no
---
How the fuck did I not get it?

#signspetition

Get used to it buddy
---
I don't know why but I thought you were correcting the title of the post, my bad.

It's kaze ga tsuyoku fuiteiru (English title: run with the wind)
---
A good one, also last episode will air next week so I highly recommend you to watch it now 
---
I think they should double the number of mines and make them do 2/3 of the damage
---
What only paint balloons!
---
Bro, I opened 21 brawl boxes and 2 big boxes and got nothing.. I agree with you. The luck system sux now. I hate supercell right now. Supercell, u better give me Carl right now! I hate them!!!!!
---
My day is ruined becuz of them
---
Looks nice
---
Got him like 3rd box alongside my star power for Mortis (#MortisGang BTW)
---
Same. Except it was 55 normal and 7 big.
---
I didnt even get a new brawler
---
I would say do unbox. I had same 76 boxes and got him in 65th box
---
#Good but,PUT THE HAT ON

Scary, but good.

If the devs see this and tweak it into their own game I'm excited

Btw this was screenshooted like 2 minutes after Carl's release

Only 8 Carl‚Äôs you need to pump up those numbers!

Yes How can one be so accurate?
---
Hes only 60 gems :)

Nice idea

Carl is under ‚ÄúSPECIAL‚Äù offers. Why the hell is this even a thing?

It is not a bug regard

Yeah I mean... He is only a super rare. Literally the same as unlocking Rico...

Dude how the hell did you do it

Git gud.

Take my upvote

Although I gotta ask, what happened to El Primo‚Äôs right arm lol

super rare chances never change only legendary

Stalin should be star player he had the highest

He went up two ranks in one match but it only gave hime the tokens for one rank up.

They should.

Nice keep it up

Here before trending. How you doing?

I was considering posting one of these, thanks for the warning

Just leave her as she is

Guys we all forgot about Splut Seccond

Unlock him from boxes, I literally got him from the first box I opened

I got him in my 30 brawl boxes and 3 big boxes, and as bonus i got crow!

On spike, yes. But i have a piper on rank 14 and lost 10 once.
---
hood mushketeer
---
Of course just give credit to @BrawlStarsPlug
---
i lost 6 trophies, and i should have lost 10
---
i'm fine, how about you?
---
you're missing the point
---
Understandable
---
By health, do you mean increase in HP or healing time?
---
Hell naw
---
Posting you got carl AND a legendary
---
through pure skill!
---
Great, aside from the fact I sadly didn't get Carl today
---
Lol XD
---
Is this even possible
---
True
---
Not at 200 trophies, at 300 yes. the lower the trophy count the less trophies you lose
---
Congratulation, you just wrote a book
---
And when you die you drop the balloon to make it more strategical. Unless you already said that 
---
Too soon.
---
ahh ok thanks
---
Pretty accurate, 3 normal box and got him.
---
I'm not even kidding I just understood what you said. Thank you so very much!
---
My primo used to be 400 now it is legit 245
---
r/crowgang rise up
---
Thanks for tip! Will buy carl! Also I hope u get ur next brawler soon! 
---
Sorry if it seems a little harsh, on a normal day - perhaps it would be. But I have been staring at nothing but "i unlocked car" and "look at all these carls in matchmaking" threads for several hours now. Over 500 posts about it so far, and more every time I refresh the page.
---
Is it because your spike 2 ranks lower than Piper?
---
They were meant to be together. How cute!
---
Maybe his pickaxe is an instrument that requires tuning
---
Only because i just got crow 
---
oof, that sucks man. I'm 3300 trophies and I have Crow and Pam
---
I guess in 2 days and 23 hours. 
---
Gene brock are the next
---
Pretty good huh, I had 10 big box, and 70+ brawl box, and a mega box, got nothing at all
---
taking a pic of the Russian population is not Brawl Stars related, get ready for your post to be taken down when a mod sees it 
---
We need some way for ban this players of game 
---
Haha this is awesome, I‚Äôm not sure about being able to get rid of the enemy paint with your own as that would be a bit too easy as you can just stroll back into your spawn and reset their progress technically 
---
You go against people at the same trophie level as the brawler you are using that's it
---
im kinda pissed that every support can wipe him easily when he does one mistake. and you have to go full tryhard to kill someone. a good lot of luck is needed too.. because we all know that his hp is damn low. 
---
If you're gonna copy Gedi-Kor's posts and even mention it in your bio, then don't even post...
---
Increase health by 400 per cube and damage by 10%. This means at 10 powercubes your damage is doubled!
---
We really need this
---
Great
---
Then that‚Äôs terrible matchmaking, because someone could easily just not use the brawler I‚Äôm playing as
---
That is good 
---
playing jessie on split second be like

r/usefullyellowsquare

No worries and yeah it pisses everyone off as a lot of the time it is the randy teammates being shit, focus on star player and staying alive and also just adding ppl who are higher trophies than you to your friend list to get a higher chance of playing with decent people and you should see an increase in trophies, im at 6.5 and still playing with randys, dropped back like 200 last week but thats just bad luck managed to get back in a couple days
---
xD

Use the walls.

Heck, yeah

Peticion to buff mortis

Thats calm i reckon he'll be a lot more okay to play w star power

Love the concept...Hope it makes it into the game.

I play piper a lot and every once in a while I try playing her in duo showdown or gem grab.
---
Don‚Äôt
---
You see other people doing it, don‚Äôt follow them.
---
You can do it ! I saved 70 boxes ans got Carl in the 2nd ü§£
---
I agree. He should get increased normal movement speed (would make sense because of the minecart)
---
Showdown is what got me in this situation :(

GIVE US CARL

How to even save image ü§î
---
Kay .......:)
---
I guess there's just 2 different dimensions on the viability side of things. Whether or not you can use a brawler in more maps and whether or not other brawlers totally outshadow that brawler. 
---
In that case Crow and piper both need some help 
---
Why not the entire map ? 
---
I think he has a lot of potential to be really good in each mode.

WHY SUPERCELL?
---
ME TOO LOL
---
Just going to say this, do not spend the 50 gems buying him in the shop! Super rare brawlers are fairly easy to get and it‚Äôs just a waste of gems buying him. Unless you already have every brawler there is no point in buying him. Save those gems up for a mythic/legendary. 
---
Hello, I'm Ana I've been playing since January and I have 3,000 drinks. I've only played the brawlers I've been getting for drinks. I'm tired of not having anything else, since my partner has been playing less time and 6 brawlers are already more than me.
---
Yo somebody actually saw this! I wrote that in that book over 2 months ago. I almost forgot about it!
---
Are you in a team with the Tara? Because if so, it always just scales up your matchmaking to the highest level on your team. 
---
Ppl over exaggerating Carl .... 
---
I can appreciate the time you spent, but this gives me a headache
---
I got him from 15 boxes üòÇ
---
English please
---
There's no brawler named Polly
---
Congrats!
---
Carl should have little bit shield during his super bull darryl colt rico shelly tara primo spike mortis pam can easily kill the carl. 
---
I think I actually find him rather good. He's an interesting match up with a lot of brawlers. 
---
Not many people utilize close wall strategies from what I've spectated and and seen in my own matches but I've used it and it definitely helps. I took a Mortis down in showdown only because he came close in between me and a wall. He seems balanced enough in showdown imo, facing off against him and/or playing as him didn't seem too easy or difficult, the time it takes for him to receive his pickaxe leaves him vulnerable which is definitely fair and somewhat encourages using walls to his advantage. Also a bonus, hitting people at max attack range almost always automatically guarantees the first and returning attack damage which is nice, as another brawler, I feel it gives an incentive to either keep your distance or close in if you have any ideas in mind and feel you can avoid the return shot.
---
The super is actually pretty interesting since I see a lot of people using it to escape or close the distance from brawlers and it does quite a lot of damage for sure. He's able to gain his super relatively quick, or at least it feels that way to me, both as carl and a brawler facing him.
---
I've only been able to try his star power in friendly matches, I think it's definitely worth pursuing since the faster attack means more dps.
---
I really like his design too, the victory and loss animations give a lot of character to the little archeologist, I wish more brawlers beside him and Leon made use of facial changes upon losing, since it's kind of weird when they're still smiling while in their defeat poses. :P
---

Dang you got me lol
---
Blue : Denis... Come here
---
Red: Dammit Denis, help me!
---
Black: Deniiiiiiiiiis, stupid assh*le! I'm dying!!!
---
Wut
---
HES TRASH! 
---
A few point to support mah argument 
---
1) His blade is so slow its easy to doge his shots making it impossible to hit anyone. 
---
2)His blade moves slow also means its reload speed it slow.
---
3) Damage is not significant, with the reload speed you might as well use piper. 
---
4) His movement speed is so slow making first fast-peeking harder and second making running toward a enemy chasing them harder because it has to wait till the axe comes back.
---
5)His super has a flaw and that is that his HP isnt that much people like colt can brust him down before he even come close. but maybe that not you play it.
---
I know a lot of people say that hitting the wall bounces the thing back faster, but lets be honest that perfect scenario does not often come along. But hey maybe its because I havent level him up. 
---
F. 2nd account bro !
---
same here, sort of... 9k 1 legendary and missing gene and carl
---
Im the tara and other two are randoms
---
Were you having a winning streak
---
I dont like that a lv9 Carl and a maxed Carl is so different. I get that the star power is supposed to change or add sth to a brawler's playstyle but this is just flat out unfair. Carl's whole dps is dependent on how often he gets to throw his pickaxe. Buffing the projectile speed is really... wrong.
---
I suggest making his projectile speed the same throughout all levels and change his star power
---
a month? that's nothing
---
I‚Äôm missing 5 brawlers at 8800 trophies
---
no one in my boxes T.T
---
Wow. You‚Äôre luck is still pretty good. A lot of people didn‚Äôt even get Carl from that. 
---
maybe in a month bro
---
That‚Äôs what I thought. Great map though!
---
Yeah, but a little bit worse. Darryl can be good without it. 
---
Unlike Darryl I'd say the improvement from him it's not that good imo, Darryl can still clap without the shield, the star power gives him more clapability.  
---
I‚Äôm missing 5 brawlers at 8800 trophies......
---
EL REYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY PRIMOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
---
Orra
---
This makes me sad 
---
From the comments in the subreddit, I think that a lot of people believe that carl is a bit underpowered. He will, like gene previously, get a buff. I think rn it is easy to use him in sd as ppl dont know how to counter him yet, but as you said, it would be difficult to use him at high lvl gameplay, like frank
---
Isee thanks
---
Big chungus in march 2019
---
I opened 71 small and 8 big boxes, but I didn't get him. Instead I got gene and im happier cause I dont like carl very much, but I had 45 gems and I got 43 gems from the boxes, so I bought him from the shop and now I have two new brawlers. I think Carl is strong but his attacks are easy to dodge and he is SO bad from a short distance, I destroyed every carl with gene, and gene isn't even very strong
---
I really want to know what made you guys give him the name Carl... Are we going to get a brawler named Keith next? or maybe Sean? I'd like a brawler named Brittney. o.0
---
Wow
---
Lucky
---
See you in hot
---
Darn
---
Took him only 4 minutes to open all that
---
Initially I thought he was weak but after playing I have realised that when you can play him he is super strong as he has a few keys things that make him so.
---
1) Ability to go around walls. in a match where you are the other side of a wall a careful axe throw can banana around a wall and catch someone on the way back. This allows for very clever attacks that even throwers cannot manage.
---
2) his reach is excellent.
---
3)His super is strong which is mostly useful as a way of combating melee brawlers who think you are easy prey.
---
4) Remember in Showdown to throw the axe into a wall or cactus when breaking boxes. equally well position throws get returned faster if they hit walls.
---
Once people get use to him I truly believe he is a top tier brawler.
---
10 big boxes?
---
Rip
---
I got all legendaries from boxes.
---
I play since global launch and only bought money offers.
---
Maybe my perception is a bit off because of that, but seeing how LOTS of people suggest others to NOT buy legendaries at 500gems, maybe there's a reason behind that
---
are you sure that is not a friendly battle?
---
Oh........
---
Sigh
---
well that's a boomstick!
---
Ah that's hot
---
Here before this explodes-
---
Amazing work as always üíï
---
P2P? Aint it P2W
---
Where are you from?  Will add you if not too far distance.
---
what about piper? Please send some love toward piper, she is bad at level 1, what are everyone else's thoughts?
---
It's not a glitch they used the super at the same time 
---
Dude this is the first time i want it to actually be real because also im an insane piper player!
---
Wow, did you pay or play early?
---
Maybe deflect attacks when he spins? But the projectile would be lead by rng. Only works with projectile based like colt or brock, melee attacks like nita, el primo, and frank wouldnt be affected. 
---
Did you slow it down or did they slow down on their own?
---
‚ÄúClapability‚Äù lmfao
---
You mind if i steal that? 
---
Just 14 minutes and a platinum already. This is true dedication. You deserve it, Gedi-Kor. Love the new skin‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
---
What's it shoot? Looking good though!
---
You were teaming too asshole
---
I expect a buff soon, he's pretty fun in showdown cause you can get boxes quickyl against walls, but  unlike boxes the ennemies moves so this scenario occurs pretty much never, and with his slow attack speed in 1v1 you lose pretty much every match up.
---
It hasn't been so hard so far becauss 80% in showdown are other carl but I felt the struggle against some bo's and leon who just can unleash 3 shots in a row when you're axe is still in the air.
---
I like it!
---
Wouldn't call that art
---
got gene from a free box from shop
---
Buff crow
---
my luck went to piper
---
Lmao a lot of people, even if not using carl, got a new brawler so they are also playing it like that random tara and spike. Like me i just got frank
---
Sooo annoying
---
Bayblade
---
happy cake day 
---
Thanksüî•

&lt;3
---
I got you bro. Spread the word hahahah.
---
This is unbelievable... with 10 big boxes and 50 normal boxes I didn't get Carl... 
---
Did you get him?
---
Cheap ass offer
---
Yet to get on to see him and maybe get him
---
Cool), Hope SUPERSELL 'll  add this in game!
---
No cuz I named myself after what I like to eat
---
"Tiny Brain"
---
Ok üëç
---
Use brawler with high movement speed like crow easy counter.
---
üëå‚Ñ¢Ô∏è
---
You fixed the rocket launcher!
---
Mythic chances never change
---
I tried for Carl and ended up getting spike AND crow üòÜ
---
Hot üò≥
---
I mean, to each their own. If spending 3-4 dollars worth of gems is worth it to a person to get to play the character right away, that's fine. I don't play this game everyday, so when I do, I want to be able to try / play different characters without praying to god I unlock a new character at 1% odds. 
---
It's silly to optimize investments on gems when the whole point of the game is to have fun for people. You can't tell me I am wasting 60 gems for nothing; I spent 60 gems (which I got for free from free boxes...) to get to play the character early. 
---
Thats lame...common Gedi Kor.. Do better! 
---
F in the chat pls
---
Tell him I said "Sad"
---
same
---
I can change my name from brawl stars
---
my cousin put me one that I do not like
---
What do u mean
---
Wait is Carl just a poco skin?
---
Lux? From lol
---
That's dope! Have you done any other characters? 
---
No , i am not speaking of this... 
---
Such a meme should have a correct historical backround
---
Lol I didnt even have 59 gems lol im a really bad f2p player üòÖ
---
I added that just in case they did, advice still stands for legends though.
---
One of the few Gedi skins I actually like
---
I‚Äôd buy it, but I have under -2000 gems
---
Im not watching that
---
Ok
---
Me too
---
I cant get crow twice
---
the hand does face towards gene when it grabs a brawler(hopefully my eyesight is good)
---
This is Masterpiece!!
---
I haven't unlocked all super rares since last year
---
I mean I did it for fun...
---
Makes us six
---
2 plat? Matches well,  incredible job!
---
But I had a D in my history class!
---
aus masgeschneiderter Arbeit. (another long word :P)
---
His super doesn‚Äôt stop against Tara‚Äôs genes franks Shelly‚Äôs etc and yeah it is a feature
---
ikr
---
I don't gained him,AND MY  BROTHER GAINED LEON,why sup why?
---
Such a small change, but very convenient. When your teammate is batting, you know when to run 
---
Interesting
---
He only works on some maps(heist, sd, maybe GG) and it depends on how you use him. Hes great at sniping certain brawlers. Can only kill shelly bull primo if they already took damage. You're supposed to have the ending hitbox of your roll connect to a brawler and then you can finish him off with 1 or 2 shots
---
What are those Launch pads there for (
---
They don't follow you, they are just so big that the 3d glasses start to cut them off
---
Year but such memes are only funny and make  sense if they have a historical backround, just remember this next time. I didnt want to offend you , it was just a infomation
---
Royal loved this skinüòçüíñ
---
congrats dude why dont we celebrate by posting our account information 
---
Got crow carl and gene in 70 boxes today 
---
No it's 1,2 for each try, a normal box got 3 tries and a big box 10 tries. Just read the section when there are chances.
---
Wow that‚Äôs actually so good
---
In case you're new here I was waiting for Carl to come out, I'm just saving boxes to have more luck. So you're message is useless. 
---
Pretty sure penny can attack over walls
---
140 box here and no Carl too ... it's less than 0.8% chances, what a luck !
---
They have file size limitations so I don't think they will add it sorry
---
Lucky I had 3 big boxes and 15 regular ones and I didn‚Äôt get him
---
good idea
---
Hey errr this isn‚Äôt my post but just thought I‚Äôd ask how to play mortis on any showdown map that‚Äôs open 
---
I saw that the day Carl countdown started and even got a supercell response
---
Nop, 1 %
---
Dont you dare
---
Just because you are to bad to play him
---
I opened all My 100 boxes and got nothing. But then i realised that i got enough gems to buy him:-)
---
Come be part of the Leon gang my bruddah
---
Nah i just forgot 
---
Thank you guys 
---
AWESOME
---
"He's a common"
---
I cant rank you if you play bull. Try playing something more skillful
---
Thanks for you comment !
---
I am happy to find someone who agree with me
---
Wow u bad if it your first solo. How many trophies are you on?
---
High five dude i got gene from my third box today
---
Maybe he‚Äôll get buffed soon
---
I got mortis but no Carl :/
---
Hallo mankertje

Tu reparou na pintura, mas n√£o reparou nos livros?

Hey Random. Lol I found outside of Brawl Stars 
---
How can you say such a thing
---
clickbait
---
so you‚Äôre trying to impose homosexuality on to the kids that play this? hence the transvestite mortis...
---
Very cool, but nah I don‚Äôt really see it
---
He is really good
---
Perspective ting
---
GEDI-KOR is uploading fully designed skins and brawler concepts, as opposed to just skin thumbnails for existing skins.  These are a few frames redone, no offense to OP its actually really well done, but definitely more repetitive than completely original designs. Besides that, trying to put all GEDI-KORs posts into one single post would be ridiculous, and this could very easily just be done as a grid of skin thumbnails. I dont really see what the huge issue with my opinion is?
---
Son of the bitch 
---
Should i buy him?
---
Thank you! 
---
What the hell, man
---
I think he‚Äôs trash super looks better than it is as it  is really easy to get hits while using it. He has no chance against close range brawlers even with walls nearby. His attack is very easy to avoid and does minimal damage.
---
You only had a 59% chance for Carl, a little bit unlucky but nothing worth quitting
---
*stolen
---
[Humor] 
---
I don‚Äôt mean to say your opinion itself is an issue, but you seem to be oddly against these posts when they‚Äôre harmless
---
drop rate is ridiculous bruh, huge money grab, i pulled leon in 15 boxes and can‚Äôt pull carl
---
He needs a buff
---
Have you been playing on my wifi again? How many times do i must tell to use 4g instead. 
---
Oh shit I meant to say first one with Carl, I have won many showdowns lol I am at 3450
---
I stopped at about 420 so it‚Äôs yours to take üòÖ
---
Naw "broken" is wht he is now....
---
It should have been carlos
---
Congrats üòä
---
I got carl literally 10 seconds after it came out in one brawl box
---
The*
---
Didn‚Äôt have enough chests to level gene up, was more prepared this time üòÖ
---
How many total trophies do you have?
---
viking bull is pure alpha
---
Nerf Crow
---
poco and primo
---
My favorite is King Frank. I wish that skin would be in the game.
---
how dare you disrespect the bottom guy like that 
---
Ok good good. I was a little worried for ya buddy, but I‚Äôm relieved me. 
---
Np man! 
---
ahhh I see. thanks
---
LMFAO nice one
---
Well maybe
---
Wtf no.
---
I died in a game because I killed another Carl and his pickaxe came back and killed me
---
I did as well xD
---
Carefully, he‚Äôs a hero day 4
---
super rares aren't that hard to get, that's also enough gems to get a discounted 80 gem skin so not worth it
---
Happy cake day 
---
Dont he is rlly bad
---
I'm a F2P player. But what should i do with 69 gems?
---
no I mean the youtuber lol
---
A. Carl is garbage when not maxed out, as it takes forever to retrieve his pickaxe again, and any brawler can simply walk out of the path of the shot.
---
B. Carl is pretty decent when maxed, his Dps is a heck of a lot better and he can be useful in some situations.
---
C. Carl is op as hell as he can shred the safe in heist if there is a wall by it and the other team makes bad plays.
---
D. Carl is new and we just don't know how to play him yet.
---
I love this üòçüòç
---
f
---
Umm buy skins their dlc open boxes to get brawlers
---
Lol tht jessie literally gave the chance (assist) to the bull lol 
---
There is no way, show me a picture of ur acc
---
NO ONE CARES THAT YOU GOT CARLL
---
i made this maps trying to improve the water problems yall had for the ball doesn't get stuck i also added bushes for close range characters 
---
It would be nice if they just added a health bar of your teammates!
---
Yeah BOTH the Frank and the Jessie just auto-aims...
---
Thank you for making these hope,they will be added in brawl stars.
---
No problem

Yea seems like a pretty spot on assessment, I wish you could call back his ax early or damage ticked quicker with the ax over an opponent. Overall I‚Äôm totally underwhelmed 
---
Nicee! I m at 9.7k right now haha , how many brawlers do u hv?

SUPERCELL HIRR THIS MAN ALREADY
---
I'LL TAKE YOUR ENTIRE STOCK 
---
Mmk I'll edit it
---
Haha
---
Uh, sorry mate
---
Don't buy it with gems. Since it's a super rare brawler you will find it pretty easy inside [boxes. As](https://boxes.As) a F2P player, usually what  i do with gems is buying token doublers or mega box (when on sale for 49 gems)
---
are your balls the next brawler they'll release?
---
Token doubler is the best way to spend gems.
---
Not big fan I don‚Äôt have him but I did play with a friends Carl and he was kinda bad a little lack luster 
---
nut
---
I know this is gem grab but that was a Heist
---
Best way to progress is to buy Key doubler or tickets 
---
Splatoon stars xd 
---
And add new skins of calamar :v
---
She is sugar and spice 
---
Carl ult is the ultimate way of teaming 
---
Are you okay?
---
Os livros podem ser uma pista sobre a hist√≥ria dos Brawlers, que talvez esteja bem pr√≥ximo de voltar 
---
If those 67 notifications bother you, you will hate mine. I got over 850 notifications.
---
Bro you're so lucky
---
Wtf
---
How dare u dis Brock! Raaahh! 
---
Tell me that darryl is not by far the best brawler in the game. Oh yeah, pam. Pam's a close second
---
repost with the same title 
---
Another great skin 
---
agreed
---
Thanks love the map
---
I always do that and then...
---
I got carl from a box nothig changed
---
The funny thing is, you go 9th on your first game.
---
Respawn in the middle
---
I just want to say that the unique look of Carl is incredible, I really like the creative direction the team is going!
---
Maybe one by day, to have a long term impact and to become famous, as Gedi-Kor did 
---
Wam bam here comes Pam!
---
in spanish its "GENIO" which literally means "Genie"
---
Pra que tira o chap√©u
---
I thought about making this kind of comment and then I realised how annoying it could be, so I didn‚Äôt 
---
Your odds of getting a legendary reset to the defauly
---
Thanks my friends say I use illegal tactics
---
quem dera fosse, adorava a hist√≥ria da nita
---
de certa forma era sombria
---
nah gedi-kor is way better than me, he deserves way more
---
This is a mainly English subreddit pal
---
Getting epic over super rare isn‚Äôt crap. Anyway Carl‚Äôs crap. I would love piper any day. My first brawler to get 500 trophies 
---
underpowerd
---
Carl spins like a Dynamike
---
XD incept i am that friend
---
Jokes on you jessie works for fbi
---
Ok bro
---
Up
---
What if his star power gave him a Darryl like shield while spinning
---
At least she will play with you more often üòâ
---
this fix needs a fix
---
MAKE THE CUBE MINIMALISTIC TOO GOD DAMMIT
---
Can i have this xD
---
I had opened 5 before I remembered to record
---
We'll see
---
yeah, I meant that Gedi-Kor is now so famous that I know I will always put an upvote on his post without even looking at it. If you do one post a day, there will be one of your post on the top 5 posts every day for one/two weeks, and Supercell will be more impacted, and the players will know your posts and agree with this cause that we are all defending!!üòÇ
---
you could do flashing red for incoming damage and solid red for critically low health
---
He just assumed Gene‚Äôs gender
---
r/lostredditors
---
No it‚Äôs called I don‚Äôt check reddit every fucking day like you do, you dumbass. I will beat the living daylights out of you in brawl stars. You suck at the game. You suck at reddit too. 
---
Nothing better than free trophies
---
you assumed the assumer's gender
---
Hey I got piper too
---
I'll wait a bit more before I make the call to Google. It just sucks that all my progress is gone.
---
Outside
---
At least I can‚Äôt assume a robot üòÖ
---
Thanks!!!
---
Doooo it just dooooo it 
---
movement speed buff needed imo
---
I drew it 
---
Upside down
---
I think Carl is very well designed. I‚Äôm having a blast playing with him! It‚Äôs true he requires a high skill cap.. but I really like the boomerang attack and the super is incredible! Seems like he‚Äôs really solid in every mode except heist 
---
The Legend of Piper
---
9K
---
Brock is top tier right now .... 
---
You hit the nose on the head that he's a high skill brawler, and I think that's fine for the game, but you're being a little bit gracious about how undertuned Carl is right now.
---
Maybe he scales really nicely with levels, and the lvl 9 star power makes him much easier to play consistently, but i find that right now key plays with him are just too situational. 
---
He's so incredibly dependent on timing, and in a game where micro-moments matter, Carl is just too weak.
---
Trying to stay mobile and dodge enemy attacks after you've thrown the axe can prolong the return time, making you that much more vulnerable. On top of that, the longer the pickaxe is out there, the longer the cooldown on health auto-regen.
---
I will say that if you can catch your enemy right at the end of the pickax path so that it "hovers" on your target for a second, it's pretty satisfying.
---
Also, I've absolutely Vitamix'd whole teams during Brawl Ball with his super, and when you do that, you basically get credit for a whole additional Super. 
---
Are you still on a android or did you switch to iPhone?
---
No box in ten did 
---
For me at least :(
---
Haha thts sad, but I heard someone opened up 200 boxes and didn‚Äôt get Carl ... 
---
had 60 brawl boxes and 6 big boxes. pulled a carl on the first 3 and a piper on the last 10. hella lucky since i didnt get any brawler in like 1000 trophies.
---
Cause it was a clever pun
---
Also the ID is optional, I made it to play on my phone and iPad, but they also give you a free barley skin
---
r/woooosh
---
Fairly common with a low brawler like ur carl
---
I brought up this idea not issue that it would be cool if Supercell added buying extra name changes, and I don‚Äôt think you want to know it might hit your soul.
---
How is that not?
---
he thinks. 
---
Haha had to google the ref, didn't know about this cartoon, the design is quite similar indeed !
---
Can you tell that everything else on the screen are normal speed?
---
uh... that's a bit different but sure I guess
---
That‚Äôs a upvote 
---
Cross your fingers and hope he posts it himself on YT
---
Join r/leongang!
---
Ok I don't have him yet.  I have only seen him in videos but all the videos I saw it was to the left.  
---
is frank not helping?
---
Will not be meta even with star power its hard to hit ur shots and hes an easy target while his picaxe is out
---
Best modes
---
1. Showdown-not the best but ok in meduim-long range maps due to his high health abilty to open boxes fast and a super that can kill most long range brawlers
---
2. Gem grab-hes not a gem carrier due to him being easy to kill while his pic is being trown hes not a agro due to his slow movement and counters being close range but ok at support and supering on low health brawlers with gems
---
3. Brawl ball- his high health makes him a ball carrier and people group a lot on bb so more value from his main atk and a high skill cap with passing to the enemy as they shoot to waste there ammo
---
4. Seige- hes ok works best on bot drop being able to be a range tank and the wall by the ike increases his dps while being able to chase enemys with bolts via super
---
5. Heist-wouldnt recommend not enough damage to kill tanks and attack the safe
---
?. Bounty- havent played him here yet so not sure where to rank him hes hard to hit shots and out ranged by the main bounty brawlers but on the other hand he has a lot of health and a defence/offense super what do u think?
---
Proposed buff 
---
Make his star power part of his attack and change it to doing more damage when the pickaxe is traveling back slightly nerfing his biggest weakness close range brawlers
---
Dammit I really wanted a brawler that wasn't coming out yet but I got Spike Crow Leon Carl all in one box in so mad /s
---
I got him on my 20th mini box of 118
---
I mean u draw so well
---
Better than my middle school art teachersüòÇ
---
Havent gotten anything since november 5th, and I got every star power and the first 21 brawlers to exists ;-;
---
They said a legendary will destroy your chances of pulling a legendary but I pulled leon and spike in the same day
---
What a lie 
---
now as to raise the question i understand his intentions... he wanted to team with the ennemies and save us from a loss
---
Exactly 
---
I don‚Äôt know how to prove it to ya, but I‚Äôm not kidding
---
Its Carl's matchmaking, since hes brand new servers are weird and you can get matched with guys at 7k trophies
---
Yeah, it's not my favorite. I think it isn't smart to constantly praise gedi, if we give him honest feedback it will only help him improve!
---
specify what's made by you
---
Honestly the no hat should be removed. Hardly anyone likes it and the hat Mortis should be the new default. It just feels awkward having a skin for Mortis which is a hat added on.
---
Siege is my favor game mode. Do people here really hate it?
---
I just have a lvl 2 one and he seems pretty good... Doesn't seem overpowered but definitely not trash. 
---
How did you get Carl to 700 trophies 
---
Me too bro had saved up about 100 boxes and didn‚Äôt get him then had to buy him ü§¨
---
Ye, it does that stuff
---
Nice editing
---
Its a Super Rare, bruh
---
She costes you like lots of trophies make her pay with somw real cash 
---
Very true
---
Thanks
---
Just countinueing this because I want to see more lines.
---
No duh, ur power 7 and have 21 power cubes while she has none and level 4
---
I didn‚Äôt get Carl or gene, I‚Äôm that one kid who watches everyone else have fun 
---
Yeah!
---
Legendary odds only lower if you get a mythic or a legendary, they won‚Äôt decrease if you get a epic or lower

Oh, should I delete this post?
---
Getting karma is easy though
---
Its even......
---
same, I push every brawler 400
---
What are you blind?
---
No it‚Äôs fine just wanted to let you know, keep it up üëç
---
Do Pam! *realizes she has no skins* Nooooo
---
I mean, if you guys clearly lost and there are only 10 seconds left, there's no point
---
Was the Frank doing it for the whole battle
---
Not missing anything honestly. Average at the moment. 
---
Just make a mini that's what I do when I play with my 4k trophies friends 
---
Ur wasting UR time commenting a useless comment that is %200 inaccurate.
---
genius, you think i am dumb?
---
It should be an option. I would recommend asking r/askreddit if you can't figure it out 
---
*pretends to not see that* 
---
r/doublewoosh
---
thats not what r/askreddit is for
---
To be FRANK with you, they didn't spread out and left themselves wide open for a TARAble team wipe. You don't have to BULLy these scrubs.
---
carl: master of spinjitzu
---
My bad
---
I think he can (mostly) hold his own in showdown, which is good.
---
Wait, there are other modes?
---
I‚Äôll do you one better, WHO is Peon
---
#FACE OFF IN EPIC BATTLE
---
Brawlers usually have names that fit whatever they do, wouldn't this kind of idk change that? Good idea either way
---
They're just being followers.
---
Same but i got carl and leon üòé
---
I get a bigger pam vibe 
---
Epic screenshot
---
Fix gem grab? Gem grab is already a great mode. 
---
Just stick the dick in the toilet and let it hit the water because it doesn‚Äôt even matter bc you‚Äôre gonna wipe it off anyway
---
Mine is the opposite : it lags as fuck when on 4g, but is ok with some lagspikes from time to time with wifi.
---
who says buff leon
---
You wipe your dick off?
---
Karl Kart*
---
Why you don't fix the matchmaking issues?
---
I had carl lv1 with zero trophies and got matched against a similar carl but my teammates and other opponents had more than 150 trophies even 250+ and above lv6-7. 
---
Every brawler should have similar trophies and lv not like it is now 1v1 at matching people.
---
I had a screenshot of it but I can't post it. I don't know how other people post pictures but I can't.
---
I can text and send vids but not pictures. Really pissed off. Don't ask us then to help you with feedback if we can't with proves of pics or other things üò†üò°
---
Too much bush, have you see cavern churn üò§ and not necessarily
---
I saved like 20, I know that‚Äôs not a lot but still üò©
---
This hapenned to me. I open 1 box
---
Are you sure that it's showdown. I think it's bounty.
---
I disagree, however it is a tad slow. Carl works well in the Heist map for today, and Carl is good at Solo Showdown. He can be a bit overpowered, and earlier I watched my friend use a super from Carl and destroy a Darryl at close range... But, since the attack is slow on Carl, maybe buff the health by a little bit?
---
Lol I had about a 100 boxes and unlocked Tara and Morris, no Carl. 
---
My fav yet!! Amazing
---
Its the ultimate bush finder especially since she can shoot off her turrets to find someone too. Just a tad op.
---
Instead of a stat boost for his star power, maybe have him chuck out a few bombs from his minecart while he is using his super. The bombs would explode when they hit the ground and do about 250 damage each.
---
Saved up 70 boxes but got no Carl, feelsbadman
---
The Penny's creepy 
---
Supported!
---
I had around 60 and didnt get it, feelsbadman
---
I took the deal in the shop and bought Carl and he is totally worth it! I'm super happy a d he's hilarious to play with, especially now with like 5 Carl's on a map hahah
---
Buy Carl in the shop he isn‚Äôt that expensive if u have gems
---
Carl because of the cart he's in
---
Please supercell add this
---
you are literally able to do a green square and tilt it on photoshop and write a one in any microsoft default font and it would do well
---
Hire him already ffs
---
no.
---
*pulls out aperture science handheld portal device and yeets into the moon *
---
I'm so glad you care about the game
---
No biting your toenails for 5 hours!
---
SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACEEEEEEEEE
---
Best skin till now.
---
Hey supercell u have to put this in the game
---
Idk how you do that. Been stuck at 8.1k for a while now @ randoms
---
Because your probably a loser who had some time on his hands, so you tried to impress some 10 year olds on the internet.
---
Wdym
---
Supercell at the moment doing an Oprah - "you get Carl, you get Carl, everyone gets Carl"
---
Don't know how I'd be trolling and I'm not a bot.
---
*Me after look the skin*
---
DAD! THE CREDIT CARD NOOOW!!
---
Umm not really 
---
More like you were just facing a really bad piper. 
---
My only advice is to drink a lot of water.

I got mortis instead of carl.

That mike was a moron.

this port genuinely made me laugh
