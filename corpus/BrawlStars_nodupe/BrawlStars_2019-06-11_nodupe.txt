5/5

---
no 4444 is the best milestone
---
Yeah completely agree I feel like theres enough brawlers in the game for now any more and it will feel over saturated with many similar brawlers. I cant be the only one wanting new modes, club battles things along those lines.
---
No, for continuous games of bots

That‚Äôs what a murderer trying to avoid suspicion would say

I am f2p i got spike at 3.5k now i have 7.5k
---
Thicochet is thiquer
---
Yeah I was aware of this just dont want to get mt hopes up and them to just drop another brawler with more maps and skins :/
---
Yeah, i think the buff mortis thing is just people that dont have the skill to play him good cus he has a skill cap
---
Then why do you have leon as your main
---
Rosa still needs a nerf
---
Yeah I didn't like the remodel at all.

I got all 3 by I got them like a long time ago for free except for Leon which I got at the start of the year Crow(2k+), Spike(5k+), Leon(14k+)
---
Why is it showdown with 2 people?
---
Random's be like:
---

---
Small Brain: Using Leon's super in a bush then exiting the bush
---
Bigger Brain: Using Leon's super in the open
---
God: Using Leon's super while poisoned by crow
---
The Universe: Using Leon's super while in a bush then staying in it

Nah, dawg that‚Äôs shelly
---
Google supercell support service and click the website on top scroll down and you will see  brawl stars helpshift
---
My god. These are all horrifically bad. I really really really hope to never see any of these in game
---
If?
---
I don't have his star power and I think he is fine, but if they were to buff Mortis I'd want them to give him 4 attack bars.
---

Then shotguners would be 2 weak

good, but she's to skinny

What did it cost?
---
Great map :)
---
Why you bully me? I do have a perspective of seeing things and you should not get away with it... Only because I said coach Cory said something wrong, doesn't mean I am a bad guy and you criticize anything.
---
And, for the map, let me tell you that an empty map is where Piper's and Brock's get their chance to shine... Don't you notice those unbreakable walls on each corner? People mostly get affectionated by the different colour bushes, two safes, or two gem sources... But the ACTUALLY forget that these things are just a show, and might not make a huge difference in the gameplay. Also, I think that putting walls all over the place is not a "WELL THOUGHT OF" map.. but understanding the game type, and making changes accordingly is what makes people like Mordeus and RedOwen stand apart from the crowd.
---
I never did have the time to watch the first part fully so I‚Äôm gonna binge it hard

ok?

Gracias!

Everything
---
We just charged at the enemy siege to do as much damage as possible. I‚Äôm pretty sure we ended up losing.
---
Too much bushes
---
If you don't agree me, just tell me why is mortis a very 'high skill cap' brawler if he auto aims that frequently? Don't tell me people play him like a shotgunner.. they are not so idiot that they forgot to check his health, which is 2/3 of an actual tank.
---
Power
---
Thank you leon very nice
---
amazing
---
she really needs buff
---
He just wanted all the glory, i hate those types of people.

Let me show u my redeemer

I know its annoying, but I dont want to wait more than 10 seconds to find a match on a bathroom game like this, and I know the game would be less liked overrall. matchmaking HAS to make decisions like this to put you in a game fast, but maybe they could implement a more complex system that you can click on fast game or to queue up only with people with your trophy range...

Really nice in design, not so good ingame.

I have *several* questions.
---
Rip-off Football Bull?
---
How about Frank
---
Sometimes it's the person who is playing that person's fault, I played heist with dyna and the bull and primo walk in a straight line towards me non-stop if I they didn't know how to manually aim. But crow is just annoying except against tanks like rosa and bull. Crow marks enemies so they can no longer hide in a bush, I also feel like crow isn't a good 3v3 brawler, he is more showdown brawler like leon especially in duos
---
This is good! Well done!
---
What? A stand?
---
What an intellectual
---
Maybe it‚Äôs just you
---
Needs power boxes, siege robots, a gem mine and a brawl ball all on the map at the same time just to add some extra strategy. Other than that it's a fun looking map.

This should be done with every crow player

Haha good one but seriously tho **BUFF MORTIS NOW**

Don't you see that crazy pass at 00:37? Gives the ball to enemy not knowing they don't have the range, while dealing with the second enemy. Also, wastes a great deal of time from the clock. Why win 2-0, when you can win 1-0? :)

I thought that Brawl Stars needed an open Heist map, so I made this :) Hope you guys like it.
---
I spin so people can be happy after killing me
---
The fact that you used a font that made it fit with the comic even more makes this great. And the sneaky loss format of the original lmao
---
I only spin if they deserve it, for example: some kid pulled up on my and chased me around the whole match next thing you know, he forgets that I also have an attack button SO I TURN AROUND AND FUCKING OBLITERATE HIM AND THEN SPIN AS FAST AS POSSIBLE.
---
6th place is better than 7th place.
---
"Standr"
---
actually he was 7th but he was able to kill me without using super
---
Penny‚Äôs star power, FInally!!
---
That‚Äôs the point. If someone wants to carry, do so at their own risk. Not at the risk of randoms.
---
Cha cha real smooth primo
---
Piper is good on this map tho
---
Yesss, Penny‚Äôs star power really needed this buff. The cannon balls spraying everywhere was mostly useless! Nice patch Supercell
---
Balance changes
---
Looks great! Anything that shakes up this meta is more than welcome :)
---
Is it gonna be quick
---
I am the PAIN! I will guide you to a world beeyond your imagination!
---
Buffing Bo? But why?
---
It's still going to suck
---
Nice...meta might shift after this update..carl and gene might be balanced now
---
For people who say buff Mortis
---
*No views*
---
***95 likes 2 dislikes***
---
and when is the next client update? ;)
---
What are people seeing the new meta being with these balance changes?
---
Yessss this is the one that I was hoping for
---
Thank you Leon, very nice.
---
Yeah it will suck but still better than before
---
only 0.1 second faster
---
balance changes
---
That meant people were subscribed to brawl stars just to dislike the videos as soon as they came out
---
Because no one plays it as the brawlers that are used are very limited.
---
Boi the brawlers are really getting a buff mainly
---
The joke here is that Carl likes rocks, so hitting them would offend him
---
Its still faster bro
---
I don't see the point on nerfing Darryl
---
How long until balance changes are on
---
Gonna miss the madness that is minecart though. Loved the mayhem
---
Congrats u/BEaSTGiN, you are this weeks winner with Aqueduct Garden. 
---
https://crux.page.link/3JDf
---
r/mortisgang would be a bit happy with the buff.
---
Yes because his poison would heal for each tick and make you not lose health for 5 seconds
---
Idk the video just released
---
same!
---
I agree and I don't even have her star power. I'm excited about Mortis' reload speed buff too.
---
Are changes revealed? I didnt see it anywhere
---
Is this on YT?
---
"For vain and for glory!"
---
Thank you leon
---
Yes released 4 min ago
---
Ok? Why you telling us?
---
It's the balance changes I think
---
Buff BROCK
---
Thx man.
---
ur at a max of 1000 trophys thats why stop whineing like a bitch u frickin dumbass
---
Her super is the only thing that makes her viable. She is only good at killing tanks, and that's it. She has been weak as she struggles against most brawlers
---
So shut up and go to your 3000 trophies

0,1 sec. Great Supercell.

---
Oh cool
---
The worst is people who pass at the last minute so you just get stuck standing there with ball and three brawlers hammer you at once.
---
What?!
---
Rip Carl, I didn't think he needed a nerf. I think Pam needs a nerf out of all the brawlers
---
Jessie eats Pam
---
I have no idea
---
I honestly think his reload should be 2.2 secs. That osn't broken but isn't weak.
---
was carl really that strong? oh well, at least his super is untouched.
---
I think mortis should've had a range buff too since the reload speed is very meh
---
Nuked from orbit. Well, from a high enough place.
---
It's not a r/woooosh and I think he/she is replying to the wrong person.
---
And r/itswooooshwith4os
---
Not against anyone with over 300 trophies. She‚Äôs only good once the bushes have been destroyed.
---
No, I thought that if I made that comment I'll get to cursed comments
---
like crow 4 months ago
---
Oof
---
It‚Äôs on the brawl stars yt channel
---
Rosa's issue is her ability to keep other brawlers within her optimal range without risk. I think a kovement speed nerf would've been more fitting, but this is ok also.
---
Your reply with so much anger only shows you ain't good honey. Firstly I'm a 12k player who's had all maxed brawlers since I was 3k.   
---
Yes, unlike some people I'm not broke, I have money which I use to support games I like.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Shelly super is good, totally agreed. She's good a good range, if you weren't 3k, then you would know how to play her... She's good at killing tanks, but she can kill others too, just need to know a few simple things: 1. Dodge, 2. Hide, 3. Aim ( don't be a noob and use autoaim ).   
---
Shelly is one of the easiest brawlers to play with. So get your facts right friend, and don't be rude to strangers.
---
Thx u! 
---
Basically dictionary definition of my random teammates
---
i guess get a new device then?
---
Ok thx
---
TrollStars
---
Pam's Super would be useful too.
---
I love how you spun asking for a pass and he just spun back. Some people are so oblivious.
---
At high trophies carl is op pam is super strong but not like carl
---
More Crow buff plsss
---
I get that it's a friendly game, but I don't see the benefits of having friendly fire. I mean, it sure would call a lot of kids arguing if it should be on and ruining their friendships.
---
I was bull, teammate was nita
---
Who is Chandler?
---
I'm saying sudden DPS dumbass.
---
No need to be rude about it
---
Rico going to be insane. Shelly buff ugh

slow should be her star power, but you did a pretty good job summarising things I'd like for her as well
---
Like it :)

upvoted :&gt;
---
It made my day
---
r/cursedcomments
---
Actually jokes aside I don't know why everyone hates this map, the minecarts are fun because they're op
---
Off topic, but true
---
Carl is pretty good
---
WHY WOULD YOU BUFF BRAWLERS FROM THE EASY WIN 7 YOU DRUNKS
---
Agreed, not to mention you don't even have to aim with him. Free damage üòÇ
---
They nerfed minecarts but not the golden sniper bot?
---
The most painfull hug
---
Sorry, i didnt see this until now when see your profile,
---
Is beautiful but seriously the attack need a nerf.
---
It‚Äôs probably just that you have an old phone. There‚Äôs not much they can do about it.
---
Whoa they really buff mortis thanks supercell... Seriously from 2. 5 to 2.4 they must be kinding
---
Ik but crow is shit I would trade him at this point if possible
---
Bo.. why, they should rework this boy.
---
Buff Morris more
---
Happy to get the mortis buff
---
I like the mortis buff, but it makes almost no difference. If it would be 2 seconds i would be happy
---
Best update so far!
---
No leon nerf :D
---
Wow, you mentioned Brawlhalla!! I love it! It's just a bit too quick but really a great game!
---
For as soon as people knows how it reacts.
---
This comment deserve some üëèüëèüëèüëè
---
Why not? Some brawlers change completely when you get their star power, Dyna is a good example. There are some maps where Dynamike with star power is a beast while Dyna without the star power is pretty bad. At high trophies almost everyone uses maxed brawlers so if you play in that range of trophies you can say Dyna is good on those maps.
---
Feels bad to be you i guess
---
Bad move supercell.
---
are you joking by the way
---
Nah
---
He now hit 448
---
I play since 4 months, and I got all the brawlers except Bibi.
---
Frank has left the chat
---
Barley beats all
---
Wow
---
Oh wow I really didn't realize that at all/s
---
big dick energy
---
Yup
---
I agree with you, she was already balanced
---
Watch me get gene after the nerf
---
I thought first too
---
Because of gem grab he's only good at gem carrying so they buffed his health to make him a lil better than other brawlers
---
If you‚Äôre going to buff mortis (and believe me that buff is huge) you‚Äôre going to need to buff the weaker thrower
---
666 upvotes üôÑ

Govno
---
I think it only works on a real match 
---
I tied it on friendly cause I don't have Star power a d it didn't work like that
---
No I am trying to get bibi now since release and I finally tought I got her when I realized that it was crow In my opinion crow is shit maybe rare but shit
---
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! I haven't really played Gene because I'm saving him for Siege! Now I can't pull people as far :(
---
I don't get it, how will it change?
---
It can't even reproduceüòÇ
---
So no one is going to talk about them buffing Shelly again? This is complete bullshit
---
It came out so good! Thanks for suggesting such a good collaboration XDDD
---
Not annoying at all because the player doesn't understand about getting out of the way, or having the ability to think more than 1 second ahead. Now supercell have catered to brain fucking dead randoms who need to l2p.
---
It‚Äôs fine bro. I didn‚Äôt get an epic until 5K.
---
No that's not what it's called when someone is really angry
---
The penny placed the turret down just after the Tara super
---
I'm not surprised. All game Devs pander to the fucking useless these days.
---
Technically he's still stronger than before (5980 vs 5880) so it's only good news.  Would be cool if instead he got a slight reload buff after rolling or reloaded a shot instantly.
---
No she does not need any more nerfs
---
OP imo, 6 bombs are just to much
---
I don‚Äôt think she needs a nerf the person who posted this does though
---
Yeah so knock it off with the whining.  We pirates be arrrrrrrrright with this.
---
That... Does put a smile on my face
---
Yeah the new star power is absolutely OP
---
Ofc not
---
It‚Äôs ‚Äústealthy assassin‚Äù.
---
Nose is too much
---
He has already been in it. He is top tier in objective based maps and this damage will make him just outside the borderline of op.

No save ur gold for upgrade

Don't forget that his super now stops healing!! Before this people could still heal while being pulled.

I don't think Mike buff is necessary imo. He's strong, his super is lethal already.
---
Accurate af.
---
6 guided bombs are to much!!! 
---
They should have reduced number of bombs also!!

Yep. I would even say he is now OP and even more on low trophies (since his shoot pattern is easily avoided at higher trophies but not at lower trophies).

It is Primoper
---
Ok perhaps i should say almost every map. Maybe you are one of those 3000 trophies stupids who don't know how to use shelly.

And by super strong i mean her skill cap is low so people like you can easily spam super and ruin the game.

Why make a meme because you do not agree with the opinion depicted in his comment? Personally, i think gene needs faster reload speed, at least by 0.1 second.

It isn't much, and making darryl less reliant from his star power is always good, but the hero kit suffers without a close gap skill(hence his reliance of his ultimate), and he will be always be worse than a pre nerf darryl with the 20s ultimate charge time.

Keep your post titles descriptive and provide context. For instance, if your post is about an in-game suggestion your title should include a brief description of what your idea is.

Completely ruins siege against her though. There‚Äôs no defending the bombs from the canon

ok first of all downvoting someone who has a different opinion to you, not cool...

second of all i dont like your attitude!!

third of all a buff and a nerf is called a rework so bibi didn‚Äôt get a buff nor a nerf and OP did say mostly all of the nerfs.

Been removed

I‚Äôve been fffffffffff

Dynamite I agree but bo? Hell no.

doesn't work in bot game
---
Can‚Äôt beat her star power in siege now. It just destroys the turret. Lost today without having a bot against.
---
Where the fuck people see hentai here?! THIS IS FREACKING CACTUS
---
you also won because someone tried to play poco on snake prairie...
---
You need to listen carefully to what she says....
---
Yeah that might've helped....
---
Megalovania
---
Can u stop repeating the same meme
---
I forgot about that, but yeah, it‚Äôs still a buff for me.
---
You could if you want, I don't mind

Crow

Invite someone to game room

Guys if you want some more "cosplays" of brawlers

Hello! Could I please use your clip in my Brawl Stars Highlights series? :) You would be properly credited in the video and in the description of the video. I won‚Äôt use the footage without your permission.

---
Time to roast some noobz
---
still waiting for that year when turrets that are meant to punish you for not moving will deal no damage to units that cant move
---
They are all happy because I don't have a legendary yet!
---
Feels baaad
---
BROOOO
---
i recently stop playing too after the 3 game losing streak it ain't worth it
---
I fucked up in the beginning but its ok

[Dyna kills mortis](https://www.reddit.com/r/dynamikegang/comments/buvotz/i_am_a_total_noob/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)
---
Yeah, there's also the fact that brawlers are getting hp buffs and rosa is now a thing so buffing him back to his old damage might not be as bad as it seems but brawlers like spike or rico might have a harder time fighting him since he would kill them in three hits
---
I don't know. Gene is too shy to show up on my boxes.
---
Reepost
---
I dont think she will be op in those 2 modes cuz you generally want to place your turret farther away for the ennemies to get the most value out of it. If you plant it right on the safe/ike, you'll get some burst damage, yeah, but you wouldnt get that much value compared to a penny mortar placed behind a wall that forces ennemies to walk up to it in order to kill it and if they dont it will shoot at them for eternity. I think you should use her star power as an aggressive tool but more like a bonus that u get when it gets destroyed
---
Ok.
---
Not reached penny to power 9 and that is why probably I didn't know. 
---
I hereby grant you the Legendary pass
---
R/wooosh
---
I got gene yesterday. It‚Äôs sad but not much of a nerf compared to the other big three
---
M√†r elk√ºldtem neki asszem
---
I don't think a slight reload speed buff would necessitate a super nerf. Two seconds is just too long for the kind of game she's supposed to be playing.
---
When will kids learn that not every single brawler is meant to be played in showdown? BS is not Fortnite..
---
No proof= didn‚Äôt happen
---
nice as an idea
---
Can I have this as my background
---
Somebody once told me hands off my macaroni.
---
I don‚Äôt play siege
---
It was the shittiest star power before, so definetily needed a buff, but this was too much
---
ahahaha ridiculous
---
h shit, here we go again
---
Better than you. I'm looking at your profile and all the comments you have made are HATE. Guess I shouldn't take this one too seriously. Haters gonna hate.
---
You're basically bullying what means you are violating the servers rules! You're getting reported
---
Damm, Crow has nice eyebrows
---
700 trophy f2ps be like
---
Mortis is going to be very OP in the July update (crow can relate)
---
Yay crow got buffed but is gonna die cause for some reason it's a good idea to hug a cactus
---
That‚Äôs the luckiest Mega Box I‚Äôve ever seen...
---
[removed]
---
Holy shit dude what have you done
---
r/subsithoughtifellfor
---
SC could average the target distance w a random distance
---
Wouldn't say Op, but definitely better
---
I like how i see brawhalla here finally
---
Not true man where‚Äôs your source?
---
Y e a  N o O n e M a k e s L e o n D r a w i n g J o k e s

Im at 12k but i did one game with rands and i just failed so i would say i was the bad random today

HEY NOW

NOOOOOOOO

It's Eugenio!!!

https://brawlstars.fandom.com/wiki/Gems
---
The Supercell Devs are my source
---
.1 seconds can make a huge difference
---
how am i bullying when I'm literally calling you out on something that isnt even related to the damn subreddit you're the one being reported
---
I miss read sand power....
---
Wtf
---
What does she do?
---
I got 9 gems once I don‚Äôt care what you say I know I did you can argue all you want but you can‚Äôt deny game history
---
1. Buffs and nerf are both a type of rework I disagree on calling them together a rework it's still just a buff and nerf if you and coach Cory want to call it a rework go ahead what it's called isn't the matter. The matter is Bibi did get buffed.
---
Only shooting stars break the mold..
---
Wait did you just unlock penny at 6700?
---
This helps Penny's star power so much, it was arguably the worst in the game. But this does break his level siege a bit. Maybe make it only enemy brawlers.
---
What are you trying to say
---
Here they are - balance changes
---
Yeah but only in very certain situations. A buff should be able to help him in lots of different scenarios
---
so I prove you wrong, and then your logic is ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care, you‚Äôre wrong, despite the fact that you just proved me wrong‚Äù
---
I tried to make it as Brawl stars related as possible and it isnt related with anything other than reddit that is apparently related with r/Brawlstars too y' know
---
Reee
---
Just saying, this was found in the Brawl Stars Apple Feature
---
james charles just kissed you, delete your account to undo
---
Omg so good
---
Yeah, he need. I mean, I‚Äôm not a very good player, but I was able to push him to 600 at level 5 without any problems
---
Im going to find that one comment you would expect from this drawing
---
Just wait
---
Well bois,we did it.We got it ALL wrong
---
May be hard to avoid damage but keeping distance will decrease more damage taken.
---
Culo o server privati? Questo √® il dilemma
---
Buff üëè Cannon üëè
---
Ok thanks
---
Wait how did you get in here
---
For real it surprises me how no one mentions Brawlhalla in this place
---
What do u mean
---
Then crow got a real buff maybe they're doing that with Mortis
---
everyone in this subreddit seem so arrogant. It's always the randoms fault. I'm ok with that though, since they aren't going to improve, meaning easier trophies for me ;)
---
~Haamburgur
---
that doesnt even make sense because you are literally trying to change something throughout all of reddit by posting it on some subreddit of a video game on a phone. THIS IS STUPID. if you want it done so badly then speak to the developers of reddit and remove this irrelevant post from this subreddit.
---
What's the name of this meme?
---
Yep
---
Uuuh...how does that work tho?
---
I'd change it to A Very Interesting Title
---
That‚Äôs pretty close. 2/3 on the losing team had more than the winning team. What‚Äôs broken here?
---
When u r hiding from shotgunners and then crow checks a bush u r in
---
This is so sad, if Gedi posted this you would get three times the upvotes for sure even though this idea and design is outstanding. If I could I would have given you gold.
---
But instead of the shovel you should make it a scythe since hes "reaper" morris
---
I meant Mortis, not morris. The r and t are right next to each other lol
---
The fact that they even had a game of almost all of the same brawlers in high level. And pretty weird that everyone was maxed also
---
Lol?
---
I mean its even that we were all maxed but still pretty weird
---
All the same brawler, all the same power level.  Balanced if you ask me.
---
What?
---
Mere mortal brawl halla is as good as smash
---
Looks like that rich royal granny that doesn't let her kids playing outside
---
Fair fight lol. I don‚Äôt even look at the matchmaking after tbh. It just pisses me off lol
---
At least we should be glad that they buff Mortis
---
Seriously
---
Not that its not balanced, I‚Äôm just annoyed with the lack of variety. Took me 3 minutes to get into a game and i got this. Matchmaking is supposed to regulate matches like this
---
Probably YT
---
I am loving this template, this is litterally how I think people think who made these jokes for the 1000th time.
---
*Unlucky players are watching you*
---
I was being ironic.
---
Well if you look on my profile you‚Äôll see what he was up to
---
Yes I know

#LeGs

same for saying same
---
Lmao you did be meme wrong
---
You are extremely right!!!!
---
You can‚Äôt image hiw much it makes me feel bad :(
---
YOU HAVE FAILED USSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSs
---
Poco: ‚ÄúWow, that sucks!‚Äù
---
Then again I was probably the bad teammate
---
LOL HOW DO YOU MESS UP THAT BADLY? btw its woooosh with 4 o‚Äôs
---
Ikr, don‚Äôt get me wrong, I love gedi‚Äôs skins but there are so many great skin creators (including you) out there who don‚Äôt even get half of the upvotes/attention/love. Some of gedi‚Äôs skins weren‚Äôt even that great after all.
---
FIRE IN THE HOLE!
---
What is the meme template name
---
I likeit
