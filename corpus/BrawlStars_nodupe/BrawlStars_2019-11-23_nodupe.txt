For me it was emz
---
---
---
I really like the brawler icon, really looks like an in game one!
---

---
About stats, idk if those are level 1 or 10 stats, but if it’s the second case then it seems pretty underpowered, since he doesn’t have any special ability that compensates them, like for example Bibi (not gonna mention too much about this since top comment already summarizes this well)
---
Just curious, why a bus as a super?
---
That’s 20 dollars in gems bro
---
Nope
---
Well its not a complaint
---
No Hat bad plz upvote
---
I think it doesn’t say who is a chick! In the brawl talk it says it in subtitles which means they’re secretly pointing out that the skins a girl I think
---
Que has hecho??
---
I thought thats part of the design?
---
No
---
True.
---
Happens to me a while back
---
u dont see the speed arrows so he has invisiheal
---
You forgot the funny
---
These are just bots designed to look like real people. These bots are low power level and will mostly only use trophy road brawlers
---
This shit boggles my mind, I’m at 9k and have very legendary
---
good game, came before brawl stars.
---
Stolen

Report it because it breaks /r/brawlstars rules for repetitive posts. It also breaks the "post titles must be descriptive rule."

---
They need to add a red one now.
---
I didnt notice the cloak but Crow’s fingers were maybe intentional
---
I wish we had some facts. Would be interesting to know. I think even I would be able to buy a gold mecha skin.
---
I have
---
10k right now
---
+
---
10k White Mecha Bo
---
10k Dragon night jessie
---
2×2,5k for Barley and Bull Skin
---
3×500 for Tara,Piper,Colt Skin
---
I think I spend 12k on boxes
---
=
---
48.5k
---
If I saved my starpoints I'd have 48.5k starpoints which means I would have been able to buy it on Monday.
---
Is this sarcastic?
---
Whats wrong?
---
Look at shiba nita’s bag strap
---
Yeah and this guy has been on reddit a year this is an intentional repost
---
Well theres always room for improvement right?
---
No emojies
---
Why tho
---
This game came first tho?
---
I’m not talking about graveyard shift
---
Leon has powers you have never seen in a mortal before
---
Pam is going to have a remodel
---
Oh thanks I'm so late by now
---
Im not pertaining to the slot. I was circling his leg. It clips through his body
---
Summer Jessie, Beach Brock also costs 80 gems with custom effects..
---
Nah it isn't that good
---
Yeah, his leg
---
Omg it’s another thrower spinspinspinspinspin hehehe we’re food lulz mortis power cubes
---
I love the idea but not the art lol
---
Bruh

Dude, he looks like Dio from Jojo
---
Yep
---
EmOjO On Reddit incredible
---
???

The furries are coming oh god oh fuck

Wow

Is that Jessie or Pam?

Stress , pain , problems

This is made by Develop Art ;----;

Sorry but yeah. It's kind of a bad post. My posts are bad too.
---
Wait for spike hes better
---
First, learn how to write that subreddit correctly. Second, this wasn’t even a joke.
---
Stop trying to be an edgy redditlord.
---
It’s probably a bit of a joke
---
But the one at home is op tho
---
Mortis gang is toxic
---
True
---
Are those skins bought from the shop? And how are they upgraded?
---
r/EmojiPolice here for this very average highlight
---
I know! Why?
---
I realize my comment sounds bad now
---
Good job this is the best so far after seeing other brawler ideas but this brawler reminds me of Frank who is not really good in this meta right now I suggest u make his damage or health higher
---
Post it on r/lootstars
---
Does anyone care?

Yes every game mode has a limit of time even training cave

Shut up darryl. You cant talk until december...

Reason: you gonna get voice. So now start poñishing your inside voice inputs for show everyone what's a real yargh!

Wait a minute.. im a darryl too right?

Uuuuh, ummm.

Supercell doesn't have control over Youtube content unless they have a valid reason to petition copyrighted material.
---
That aside, only idiots believe these hoaxes. People do this for thousands upon thousands of different games in different styles and themes of misinformation.
---
It is simply the attitude of a desperate youtuber trying to attain notoriety up until they have enough following on their platform to try converting their videos into real content and take advantage of the 20IQ followers amassed inbetween.
---
Imo they are cool but Phoenix is my favourite. I’m saving up for a mecha crow skin
---
that guy mustve been really good
---
And then that one time when I played with randoms and ended up on the same team as my friend.

I don’t understand what’s not fair in this picture

modern problems now actually do require memes

Same idk why as well

Skipe Is trash

Spike
---
Report it to Youtube for stolen content without permission. They will take down the video after warning him if he doesn't.

But time is money
---
No I haven’t, this left me felling empty
---
He’s getting a renodel
---
I know
---
Me and the boys promising to become the wrestling king
---
Your favorite brawler was the last you got?! It must've felt very satisfying then! Grats!
---
Play darryl, charge your super... roll to the ball, kick it somewhere, then someone wins
---
Why does his arm strech
---
Thats doesn’t make me have sympathy for his stupidity
---
Ya
---
Just publicizing the idea further in hopes the devs see it. But if it’s a repost on here then the original post did not get enough attention.
---
The buff we needed but didnt deserve
---
Lmao she just left you alone after lmao
---
Oof I only got both of them and not leon
---
Is your highest Frank and bull?
---
Ok thanks I see
---
Wait nvm I see now
---
Wow the meta is great
---
Wich
---
Can't see it neither thanks for bringing awareness!
---
Eh, stupidity is a debatable term. I’m not asking or trying to make anyone think that he’s stupid or not. Besides, why would I care about people’s opinions on a rando on the internet that I don’t even know?
---
Would this be nice if it was a skin, named smexy pam
---
Leon is nerfed as fuck.i m annoyed by that.If i didn't had his both star powers i wouldn't play him.star powers help him a lot.Unlocking other brawlers makes it tough to get legendaries again
---
Someone messaged me about putting my clip in their video but I didn’t respond and blocked the user, it could’ve been pumba but I’m not sure.
---
This'd prolly be a good rework
---
Been trying to decide what brawler I wanna try and hit 1k with. Not easy man well done!
---
you can
---
I was saving for brawladays skins but they  are cool but I have road rage Carl but they are limited AAAAAAAAAAAA I can't pick
---
Sniper is a good job mate
---
Wow i dont have chance for good team in Bounty :(
---
Si cute
---
You must be thick
---
Penny, Jessie...
---
Yes, we are so that
---
Excuse me?
---
Go claim copyright then, mate
---
Looks really cool!
---
But I thought that's the point
---
I hope but honestly doubt it. I’ve been playing since beta launch I’m at 15000 and I’ve never seen a legend pulled before it’s just crazy to me to hear someone pull not one but two in the same day when I’ve played for 4 years and haven’t even seen one get pulled before. Srry for being a dick it just sucks in my situation when everyone else pulls legends even though your higher then most without theM you feel
---
I’m reporting him already.
---
i think you only dodged one of two shot s haha
---
Im too actually
---
honestly the only thing that needs a buff is your skill level
---
Ouch

I hope you never get a legendary

It has been over a month but I still can’t seem to get rid of the spice. Bibi’s bubblegum won’t make it go away either. Have any solutions?

I have this too :/

Nice
---
...it’s not the same name... LOL. Look closer my friend, they are CLEARLY two different names... ALSO, if you compare the clip that OP uploaded to his profile with the one that was showcased in the video, you will see that they are IDENTICAL... Is that a good enough explanation?
---
Thx for info... Already downvoted this post
---
Don't promote not brawl stars community
---
Powerplay sucks. Supercell was talking about skills and shit, but powerplay is nothing more tham having to team up with randoms.
---
Matchmaking is also disgusting. On today's gem grab map "Four Squared", I never got a thrower teammate in my 3 matches. And got a bull who was wasting his ammo like a Shelly Bot. If this is how our skills are put to test, then I guess it's not worth to take the time out and play games just to pop up on the leaderboard screen. 
---
Supercell, it's a request that Powerplay is tweaked before the next season starts off.
---
And remove lone star
---
Are you gonna quit the game just because of skins?
---
Maple barley
---
It's the same name in different style , everyone has different style of name even the O.P has his youtube name and reddit name in different style , does it mean they are different names?
---
It's a replay with automatic perspective of match the bo has submitted clip , End of story . smh
---
happy cake day
---
You don't need fists to brutally punch someone. Stubs do just fine
---
If train stays a few seconds, he could be a useful utility brawler. Cart can shut down any brawler by cutting them off their team. Its a game changer and real unique
---
Sakura🌸
---
  MigamiNd = MegaMIND  Read both names aloud .
---
Yeah you're right, plus most of the players are from South Korea or Japan
---
I don't know what ppl are saying about it should be a gene skin, I think it would be great as a spike skin.
---
Maybe Cat-tus Spike or just Cat spike might be better, because Cat-ctus is wierd to pronounce
---
Love him or hate him

He spitting straight facts

That’s.. old?

No, It Was Released In December 2017 But Brawl Stars Was Released On App Store In June 2017...
---
I’m sorry wat
---
That’s actually incredibly good, one thing though: can you make her hat pink?
---
All in 1
---
Plot twist: supercell adds it but it's just like the situation in Boss Fight stats
---
No, It Was Released In December 2017 But Brawl Stars Was Released On App Store In June 2017... But Brawl Stars Released Globally On December 12 2018...
---
Oh! Sure! I'll repost it.
---
I think so. It says power 1 in his icon
---
Big brain time 😂
---
She’s gained Respect 100
---
 Expensive/Rare (except Star Shelly) Skins = focuses, Gold Mecha skins are very often getting shot by a few people from a few sides. Also I feel a difference between playing duo with no-skin Leon and Werewolf Leon. When I'm using the werewolf skin, I feel like even if my team has 13 power cubes, the other team has 3 power cubes and the other team has 12 power cubes, both teams (12 + 3) focus on my team and I get 3rd
---
Its obious they're cashers that have server benefits, like jesus christ, every time a rare af skin appears its the only one making a diference of at least 3 or more strenght, solo tanking and smurfing.
---
Thx
---
You are a hero, thank you so much!
---
No, It Was Released In December 2017 But Brawl Stars Was Released On App Store In June 2017 (a.k.a beta form) bit was released globally on December 12 2018 :)
---
perfect. dem is so cool and he is very weak. i love it
---
How is this woosh? Are you fucking 5?
---
Doggoooo
---
Supercell Did Not, BarbarQ Was Released In December 2017 But Brawl Stars Was Released On App Store In June 2017 (a.k.a beta form) bit was released globally on December 12 2018 :)
---
I have to go now, I won’t be back in 8 hours.
---
No highest are Mortis on this mini
---
While on my main account the highest are Darryl and Leon
---
What if we can push the ball with ammo and ammo has long ass distance for everyone?
---
I agree
---
Whaaatttt
---
But if I will credit you can I use it
---
Why nope
---
Oh gee! It's 4 am where I live now so imma finish the hat and post it here, check it out when you come back!

There is no way me and the bo recorded the same way

I did not use automatic i was manually controllibg it i have the game clip if u want i was manually controlling
---
So I started brawl stars a month after BarbarQ
---
thx :D
---
And 80%+ of the comments are people saying that the game was released before Brawl Stars and 1 person telling them the truth.
---
Supercell: Lets pretend we didn't see that
---
This is not simple they do not show this in the tutorial so you bash people if they can't play games? See your logic?  Brain of fetus
---
Or what about when you have the gems but the skin won't come in your shop
---
Okayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
---
only a few people get the skins. and they are randomly selected. you weren't

Repost!
---
This on your channel yet? I see the future
---
Btw big fan here. Since clash royale times. Yeet
---
I can't find the vud what vid I'd this?
---
It is way more worth it to use your gems on token doublers or tickets rather than buing new brawlers.
---
should be shelly at point blank with super
---
Snake Prairie in Power Play is a joke
---
Dude I just told it can’t you read?
---
yeah i don’t know what meme that is lol
---
it can be if there are too many of same brawler in matchmaking. like yesterday bounty was filled with shellies.
---
Wow 700upvotes thx guys🥰🥰
---
Lol search on google
---
We need this

But mega knight never shots laser and missile nd no immune sheild And Boss robot never jumps and crushes like mega knight but GOOD THING THIMBS UP BRO

It happened to me when lone Star came out. I was a Max Leon on 700 trophies and I was facing noobs . I got 89 stars in that game!
---
500 is WAYYY too much for a mega box. 30 power play points is enough.
---
After nine shots at Power 1, the box is alive on 60HP. It takes a Power 1 Poco 
---
# TEN
---
attacks to break a box.
---
It s beacose you have the fhone longer
---
PAIN
---
Hmmm  yes?
---
But you won't get a powercube
---
Well, it's good to see we found them and we care.
---
We here on reddit dont use “lol, lmao” also no “emojis”
---
Whit piper or crow
---
...exactly. Poco is long overdue for a subtle buff. 
---
Solution: Damage buff from 660 (924) --&gt; 720 (1008). All the other low DPS brawlers have gotten a damage buff, Nita, Tara, Penny, Jessie, and even Mortis back in January. There's a damage inflation but Supercell is neglecting the one with the lowest damage of all...
---
You don t se he say c/big mega oof 
---
So he give credit to you
---
Thank you!
---
Mega knight is ThiCCer than the boss robot
---
what would scrappy be then
---
yeah
---
You can only spend 13 min and 14 sec in any match at all. I did this when there was 'maintenance in 5 minutes.' The game kept on going till we 'beat' Gem Grab.

Two negatives make a positive...

Why are you subscribed to pumba?
---
Zombie
---
Yes
---
I mean Frank is still pretty weak after all. He takes twice as long to wind up a shot as it takes to RELOAD.
---
But you can say he steal beacose he put the link to  him instagram and not to your post sooooo
---
Pumba its a son of a stiler
---
Reposting art without credit is bad enough already. But reposting a replay?  
---
You truly are the lowest scum in history.
---
Repost
---
you're right
---
THE HEAVY IS DEAD!
---
there is no custom up/down in night mode
---
The thing is that he’s not bad, but 99.9% of people don’t know how to play him. So when people say: aw man I got a mortis in my team, they think he’s gonna be a bad mortis but if u play him well he’s super good
---
Aolo, un roman
---
It's happenes to be every other day
---
Just because the enemy is worse doesn’t mean he’s good. He’s awful.
---
Eh, i just wanted to play safe, and besides, with boxes i could've got any legendary, but i wanted crow specifically
---
Yyyeah
---
It actually happened to me
---
R.I.P Scrappy
---
Genius
---
*[Vietnam flashbacks]*
---
One month too late...
---
F u c
---
I mean, their still in ranked right? If so i wont have trouble pushing certain brawlers
---
Barley. Constant healing plus extra damage. Ooooofffff
---
That's awesome man. Mecha Crow Gang. Very cool ♥‿♥ ♥‿♥
---
I didn't forgot tick
---
Dude, you were three people at 600+ trophies against one that was at 500 and two at 200-, you couldn't lose
---
No this was a good rico map
---
You're the only one with a star power and you're going against weak opponents thanks to crap matchmaking
---
no
---
check Frank's twitter, he eats these kinda things out and posts about them, you might find what your looking for there
---
Your post has been removed, make sure to use the body of a post to elaborate on the title.
---
lol :D
---
I played barley on this map and spent 360 tickets on my mini. 4 star powers and enough coins to max out 11 brawlers. Survived over 3 minutes every time as big brawler and only had one go over 2 minutes when I was hunter. I’m actually starting to think big game offers better return on investment because of the quicker games. I’d have to do math, but I’m guessing the biggest difference is the ability to choose a squad for robo rumble vs randoms as hunters in big game.
---
The real question is why are you using light mode ?
---
Youtubers already showed this easter egg last year Just stop everyone know it already
---
Frick
---
I agree, nita would be broken
---
Cory actually said that
---
K got it
---
Contact support
---
Dark mode are for weak eyes
---
I have weak eyes
---
mortis is really only good with her star powers, hes also not suppose to go near shotgunners because reasons
---
I don't have a single legendary and I'm at 13k
---
Where would "Using Piper's super to move up and down" be ranked?
---
But it had 7 upvotes and now it has 4. YOU DONT
---
Yeah this glitch have been in the game for quite a long time
---
I played him on my mini and was big brawler 4 times. 3:01, 3:11, 3:16, 3:17. On this map, he’s amazing as big brawler and he’s actually a really good hunter if you’re smart with him.
---
Have you never had connection issues with brawl stars?
---
Thanks:3
---
This is why the power play loss system needs to be taken down. There are people who click play and do nothing purposely making you lose and you get blamed for losing by taking away your trophies and the person who did this probably has 0 power play points and I just wanna see them in real life, crack their skulls and never see them again. Why click play in the first place if you're not gonna do anything?
---
Lolz, I know, it disappeared after I restarted the game. But it makes a good joke, haha.
---
Flair checks out
---
Lmao youre all autoaiming. Even w piper. You suck bruv
---
Hope you resolved it!
---
The best day of any brawlers life(•‿•)
---
This is amazing
---
The odds are high,but,if not(low chance of not getting 1 gem).You should recharge minimal ampint of dias,it will be x6 profit.
---
What is this even supposed to mean
---
Same happen to me a 2 month ago
---
What is ampint of dias?
---
he is like the worst legendary, and you only have to get closer to kill him(even with piper, but like in a middle range to do enought damage)
---
Mega knight is still my favourite legendary
---
Amount,i misspelled.
---
Alright, maybe she does need a dmg nerf, but Crow def needs a nerf. In case you don't know, Crow outranges Bo,Tara, Leon, Sandy, Emz, Shelly.  and Sandy. With his fast speed, he can easily defeat these brawlers with ease. He outranges many brawlers and has a high dps with fast reload speed. There is something broken about that brawler when they are jumping on to Shellys with super with more power cubes, or Bull, or Primo with Super. They are getting too hot-headed. Crow needs a dmg nerf or else a range and speed nerf.
---
You got that gem ?
---
HE IS MY FAVORITE AND NOBODY CAN CHANGE MY THOUGHT OK?
---
Oof
---
What is dias?
---
I do , I saved up to 500~
---
Diamonds.
---
Oh damn forgot that thx btw
---
i agree, crow never deserved its buff, he's annoying, is fast and his poison does way too much dmg especially with the starpower. and there are too many teaming crows in high trophy showdowns. if you land all the poison daggers with his super he does atleast 6k damage.
---
I dont think I will be getting a crow offer for another months and months
---
I play mobile legends,gems there are called diamonds.
---
Should I wait? Because I don't know when he will appear
---
Omg im from Croatia!
---
Oh, I mean Crowatia xD
---
Oh ok
---
Ma bravo care
---
Sta imaa
---
Oh okay thanks.
---
Sarcasm is nice right? :)
---
Funny... You used gold even tho, you cannot buy skins with gold in Brawl Stars. Use emeralds istead, they look more like gems.
---
The cannon looks like a antiaircraft
---
More like, me and the boys farming internet points
---
Why is this so funny to me lol...
---
r/shittybrawlstars
---
Ok thanks
---
Haha hvala :))
---
This is a big box(the box for which u have to get 10 tokens) and this is a very old image when trophy road wasn't a thing and you could find any trophy road brawler inside of box.Thos was before global launch
---
Gg bro
---
Ok boomer

I got this but i lost the screen shot 😢

Becouse this is my second account.friend code is on info in my reddit account
---
People who aren't in the reddit
---
No that’s not possible, we all know that Rosa is Shelly mother or aunt but, why do you think they will say that they are siblings?
---
IMO spending gems on star powers is one of the worst values in the game. Unless that star power was OP and I’m craving it (like when band-aid heals 5040 health).
---
Wait a cinnamon FUNKING toast crunch
---
oh you're approaching me?
---
No way
---
Yeah. Especially when a Shelly and primo combo can’t hold off a bo primo combo. Nita has the worst matchup

of the bunch and she utterly dominated.

Why

This is AMAZING

Don’t do it! It’s a scam! Please just trust me! You’re gonna regret it!

god make you finger
---
just say it in Comment why you black it
---
Coincidence? I THINK NOT
---
There’s two reasons for that actually.
---
1: Brawler attacks are never just black they are either blue or red depending on if it is an ally or an enemy
---
2: Squidward paints a lot of self portraits so I made the paint the same color as him for a subtle reference
---
I don't know for sure, just my random guess
---
Wow I'm impressed
---
There are f2p players
---
Sorry, I don't support this post type (hosted:video) right now.  Feel free to check back in the future!
---
Ok. Aside the irony here, I removed most of her misses cause I couldn't apply the zoom effect, even though mortis is shit, I carried my teammates if you look in the game I killed most of the enemies and they still struggle to stay alive. I am a mortis, so I choose him whenever I want.
---
Ok, 
---
There was an episode that squidward shoots black paint, so the attack can also be dark blue or dark red
---
The hair looks so cool! Good job bro.
---
No. As in he is a brain dead brawler to use. As in you can be brain dead but still use him well. He is an OP brawler with OP mechanics and is ridiculously easy to use is what I’m saying
---
should be sandy cheeks sandy as in the squirrel
---
I HAVE 17 FUCKING BRAWLERS LEFT TO MAX THIS IS A PAIN
---
U good kiddo?
---
i just played 20 tickets with dynamike this morning, i had it worse
---
Ok good now my tick rank 15
---
And that's a fact
---
Noooo I liked playing it in friendly
---
Danke dir mein Bester :)
---
Those are all post-global Brawlers so maybe not
---
but epic victory is not so
---
After reaching 17k, yes.
---
**rolls away**
---
ertrab привет
---
Mortis
---
But how
---
I mean for someone with a close range he has low damage
---
Why did that bull go for shelly lol
---
There is always a robot who is useless
---
This is literally already in the game, it's just a change to the current daily rewards right?
---
Yo what the fuck? They don't hqve low skill caps bitch. It's not nice that someone insulted you for your main but what the fuck dude you're fucking worse than thim.
---
Piper isn't even really harder that most brawlers.
---
I was thinking about it but sandy cheeks is very aggressive and enthusiastic while sandy doesn’t give a s*** like squidward
---
Plz nerf crow
---
I dont get it. What is lock rotation?
---
Yup
---
Should’ve been the love star star
---
Smile in Shelly's super.
---

That's a big no no
---
All identical
---
That's what supercell wants you to believe.
---
It’s a function where ur screen won’t rotate. The joke of the title is he went to the other goal so “his screen was upside down”.
---
Darryl
---
This is exactly what happened. 100%
---
Just kidding..... Im not a dump.
---
curveball piper
---
I don't think you play too much. I've been saving gems for a month and I got 148 gems. Plus, all my brawlers' and maxed out except for sandy, crow, and spike which I don't have. I've been playing since global.
---
Hehe tnx
---
Well, supercell destroyed the nita and leon ship by saying they are brother and sister.
---
No way he takes more than 6 hits. Default mortis has less than 1000 damage
---
Its el brown
---
Hablablablahahah❤
---
You picked the wrong subreddit, fooooool!
---
Family???? I mean they all look the same. Sandy is their child
---
If I hadn't unboxed Crow I would have bought him with the Phoenix skin offer!! I love his Super animation, you feel like an asteroid landing :D I'm hyped for his remodel although I'm also kinda nervous, also saving up for the Gold Crow rn :) love him sm
---
U got 2 days you’ll get it ik u can
---
Im giving you an award for this comment
---
Killing using 🎵THE POWER OF MUSIC 🎸
---
It’s good to know there is people like me
---
I said max power Mortis takes 6 hits. Trust me, I keep count.
---
I know, but eventually no matter what, you will get the legendary! I got my first legendary long ago and yeah sure, when you first get it it feels awesome, but later, they just feel like another regular brawler. The more patient you are, the more rewarding it will be to get them for free.
---
Good luck. Hope you get that oné gem
---
I was actually considering getting this offer and then I pulled crow out of a regular 100 points box. First legendary ever!
---
This update was a few days back the skins how ever will come out on Monday I think
---
Oh okay I was confused when you said default
---
lo consegui hace unos dias y apenas lo tengo a Rango 13 
---
/
---
I got it a few days ago and I barely have it at Rank 13
---
So go ahead and talk about matchmaking fix. Oh, wait, I forgot, you were sucking. That's why you're avoiding the subject.
---
What reason would he play on a smurf for
---
cool dudes
---
Yeah but it's not nice knowing there are people who get all legendaries before they unlock bo
---
"chance my mind"
---
Just fit
---
r/clickbaitstars
---
Nah but I played brawl with my friend while he was there so that’s where I got the idea
---
I really like this idea.
---
This idea is mine
---
AND BE SUMMONS A BUS OUT A DAMN PORTAL OKOKOK
---
You’re feeble brain couldn’t understand it. I see we’ve met before and you’re still every bit as stupid as you were when you were mad matchmaking didn’t find you a good team comp. I now understand why you lose more than you win. You’re the Shelly is good on siege guy! I’m done with you. You were a moron 3 months ago and you’re a moron today. You’ll be a moron tomorrow most likely too. Remind your mom to cut your hot dogs in really small pieces so you don’t choke!
---
O ja
---
Not sure. But I know it was mentioned during the broadcast.
---
5)When you're losing they go AFK
---
Want a meme
---
Me asking some one how many brawlers he needs to get all brawlers
---
The guy:4 
---
Me:it’s probably the three legendarys
---
Him:bo,tick,8bit and emz 
---
Me:( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
That shouldn't be only November tho
---
It is sad but true
---
You can get them yes but the chances are very low. Some people have been playing for a long time and never had one drop
---
Not really a heavy weight with 4600 hp
---
u/repostsleuthbot
---
That happened to me twice this week why do people do that
---
I just got him and im f2p
---
But when they do get it, it will feel incredible! But not for long. The feeling of success does not last long.
---
Poor 8-bit
---
Be careful of randoms
---
Sorry I’m kind of lost, what was wrong
---
Yes i did
---
Happens to everyone, but the title got me.
---
This post is not inspired by any meme I know
---
What is a "legendary"?!  JK- just saying I do not have one yet...
---
We are many.
---
I know right?
---
Que bien jugado!!
---
Is that a biiig problem buddy?
---
F
---
r/BlackliteDistrict
---
I know how to. 1. Go to r/brawlstars 2. Click the three dots in the top right corner 3. Click "change user flair" 4. Click on any brawler you want 5. Apply the brawler you chose 6. Enjoy :)
---
Please dont
---
Bruh people post this all the time and it always got a lot of karma

Thanks man!

Yeh

Lets say our prayers, and die in peace
---
omg u could buy all the skins in the shop
---
HAHAH SO FUNNY .
---
STOP MAKING THIS STUPID JOKE
---
That's great
---
Oh! Thank you,in honor of your kindness I will use your flair to remember this very moment(also because Rico is my first level 10)
---
SAVE FOR THE NEW SKINS
---
Lol no
---
WHAT
---
I guess it wanted to see us die
---
No Problem
---
Why??
---
I've probably earned like over 500 free gems and I've only played since the android beta.
---
Lmao
---
I've been the random before
---
Let's sing together♩
---
That's right, I heard complainings over and over again!
---
Nothing is wrong
---
Welp here comes the real bear
---
What is it
---
Thank you :)
---
Lol
---
Nemoj tako prema mojoj državi(Dont be like that to my country).
---
I didn’t do that cuz their personalities don’t match so it wouldn’t make much sense
---
THE FEELS
---
Blaze :D or maybe a Chicken lol
---
Thank u :)
---
he's too dangerous to be left alive
---
I think Sandy Sandy would ve better =D
---
Sandy Sandy skin
---
Pam before she came pam lmao
---

Fov 2000

Real problems
---
BUT IS WORSE TO BE YOU, AHAHA!
---
is really, could confuse a lot, maybe if it had a different style or animation it would be more noticeable
---
what's with his body?
---
Sarow
---
What happened to the Audio
---
What in the actual f*ck
---
Are u all good in the head?
---
I wonder if i repoated
---
This looks very real
---
I dont feel like thats true, when they got rid of the elixir in the beta, I got like 300 gems or so.
---
Ur chances are low
---
True I love it
---
*Perfection*
---
Stop im gonna FAIL NNN
---
Still
---
It's probability not the amount they play. I play every day, get all the tokens and star tokens spare maybe 1 every week, and I'd say I've only saved up 50 gems max in the last month
---
oh
---
I SAID STOP I WILL FAIL NNN
---
R/cursedbrawlstars
---
We were compensated in gems when elixir was eliminated from the game.
---
İmagine yourself playing duo showdown. The enemies are 10 points stronger than you. You are playing as EMZ and your ultimate is ready. Then your teammate revives you and you spray them combined with your ulti. So satisfying.
---
Годно
---
Probably lying
---
It's a very good idea
---
SEELE
---
But. . . Sandy sandy
---
That’s a sally hoodie, and this idea is not mine
---
*cries in 2019 phone*
---
I've been saving since august so i could get skins at brawloween, christmas, and chinese new year. Almost at 150. Maybe I'll be able to get more than one skin at chinese new year.
---
Yes, i did

Naming yourself what you ate
---
Laughs in getting crow at 5k trophies, yeah, I was one of those people. I was sad though cause it was when crow sucked.
---
Congratulations! Keep playing the game while you can
---
"Ok Squidward, imagine Crow in his underwear..."
---
Crow: is chad
---
"OH NO, HE'S HOT!!".
---
LOOOOOOLLLLL I GET IT!!!!! HAHAHHAHA I LAUGH OUT LOUD!!!!! I GET IT OMG SO FUNN1!!!1!1!1!!1!1  I GET IT MAN 😏😉😂😂😂 69 NUMEBER FUNNIIIIIII1I1II1I1I!!!!!1!1!1!!1III1I1!!! HAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHQHAHHAHAHAHHQHAGGQGQGQGQGQG
---
I'd honestly play this.
---
that political opinion is going to offend someone i wouldn't be surprised if this gets taken down
---
Actually a high iq meme
---
Is this how all r/spikegang members think?
---
Damn, cool art dude
---
That's why I put `Humor` in the title
---
It's called a super, not an ult
---
Credit the creator!
---
I smell Arat
---
stop stereotyping
---
r/thebrawlstarscactus

To be fair that matchmaking is pretty unfair. Highest 625 vs 3 700+?

Here is the artist on Instagram https://www.instagram.com/_mutouyen_/

hol up
---
gucci gang
---
Cony is also mad
---
I did nt had enough colours
---
U buy big boxes from the shop!?!?!?!
---
 At least you cant fell pain anymore
---
Bruh look at the power points amount
---
they’d also be maxed
---
The same place where joseph got his Tommy gun.
---
I have a tall skinny cup and short fat one. which one holds more liquid?
---
Is it nita or leon?
---
That was ran over by a truck
---
wdym
---
Honestly we weren't playing smart or together we would have lost even if we had people at our trophy range
---
Thats really a s*** or should, I say r/shittybrawlstars
---
Votes buttons*
---
Cuute
---
#DeEr
---
Don't buy the big boxes for gems they are never worth it you should  uy the token doubler offers they give you 9 boxes token doublers for 29 or 39 gems offers is usually the way to go for f2p players
---
So basically a mix of jessie dynamike and emz
---
He is straight, but with extra steps.
---
I was thinking about that but their personalities don’t match at all so it wouldn’t make much sense
---
Just because a player doesn't play the way you want them to doesn't make them toxic. You also have to remember there are literal children playing this game.
---
Good luck( hope you win)
---
To be fair, depending on the game mode, but especially the map, he’s completely useless sometimes.
---
Except to immediately backstab and teach that Mike a lesson
---
Aww
---
ggs
---
Borger fetish is best fetish
---
Or a kiss...
---
Pokémon sword and shield
---
Oh shit oh fuck is brahl star cacti
---
Actually I think u got it wrong... the randoms spam autoshoot so they hit whatever, they don’t really choose LOL
---
Oh hell no!!
---
No!
---
wait thats illegal
---
But without crow rico is the fastest
---
Is that bad?
---
kinda cringe, but also funny at the same time
---
Basically what you just said if you want to be specific. I just find it that they randomly(pun not intended) end up shooting at me even though the objective is to kill the robot. By the way, want to play together. If so add me. My tag is #2889VGC2
---
How many trophies u got lol
---
Also your addicted to brawlstars
---
&gt;Crow: is chad
---
You have blessed me with your wisdom
---
You beta players are so full of yourselves. Sorry we started three months later than you.
---
***jazz music stops***
---
Is it Leon Nita or Nita Leon?
---
Dumb question where do you get the skins IT BETTER NOT BE A CONTEST
---
Ikr
---
Thats smooth!
---
Ah yes,i remember when i got 150 gems to get a werewolf leon (not flexing btw),honestly there's something good about seeing your gem count with so many gems,all earned with patience and luck from boxes,so congratulations for having that many
---
Normie trash?
---
Darryl and bull basically have the same star powers. Is that it?
---
this is the buff he deserves
---
Its fantastic
---
Everyone sayd who are randoms 
---
But never ask HOW are randoms
---
That is not what I mean😅 i mean that those people think they are superior just because of that skin while there are people who started playing way before them. Nobody is superior here
---
*Supercell*
---
Feel like this would work with Brock more
---
It’s a brock
---
Ok man but..... Naming yourself just blet and MMA Is........ Weird...
---
I knew it
---
I mean i was gonna argue that it was a joke but the guy flaired it as idea
---
Ricopiper!
---
Lets get 2k upvotes
---
I used twenty tickets earlier and the boss was a level 4 rosa.
---
The rest were all level 9 or 10 and there were two Shelly's who were basically playing tennis with the rosa using their supers.
---
Do this in sfm or sth like that?
---
Thanks for reminding me to save up boxes for the big update!
---
Cockatiel
---
He can still be daddy tho
---
Its alabama afterall
---
No he is is really the fastest
---
oh wait i forgot you need to charge ur super up first OOOPPSS. the idea is good. still i think trolls will use gene to stop franks from attacking or pulling someone away as they're about to score.
---
#MAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA. I DONT WANNA DIEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Yeah, I'm f2p too so the pain just adds up. Got that star shelly skin thoooo
---
I'm f2p too!
---
He fail tho
---
Sweet home Alabama plays
---
Hopefully they start allowing animations on their new Make platform
---
Thank you for the advice
---
Why the humour flair?
---
There's an app bug that always takes the respawn :/
---
bull: *gets boner*
---
Because Nita is hugging the enemy rather than fighting
---
STAND MASTER: Leon
---
STAND NAME: Bear Hunt
---
prob real him
