Next Update:
---
Brawl Talk: The biggest update yet!
---
Looking forward to seeing that ;)
---
They‚Äôre both bad but Takedown is the worst.
---
Wow supercell really be copying from clash of clans ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
There was no joke there what
---
If only you could use Brawler Skins as icons....
---
I really don‚Äôt get why people hate Takedown. It‚Äôs a reasonably well-balanced mode, the meta is pretty wide, and if you‚Äôre good at it you can almost always place well - you‚Äôre a whole lot less likely to get bullied by multiple players in Takedown than Showdown or Lone Star.
---
actually 1250 powerplay points would be 2500 gold
---
Happy birthday
---
XD wait I'm sorry I looked at colt agien XD
---
It's a good one, but in case they improve it, I just hope it doesn't affect the progress in a big part.
---

---
By the way, how do you do to get responded by a real person and not by a bot?
---
Because, in my case, no matter what I tell them, no matter how many times I send my questions, a bot will always respond me "Hi! This is the automatic support system, please select one of the options below". And when they say "Have we solved all your doubts?" I press "no" and say my question again. But it's the same thing, the bot will respond the same.
---
Spinuspinespined
---
The joke is dead
---
That makes me sickü§Æ
---
For real
---
Thank you so much &lt;33
---
Club wars?
---
That was legit what I was about to comment.
---
I am not sure who posted it first I just started 2 months ago
---
Anime fight
---
Someone‚Äôs boutta get wooooshed, I can feel it.
---
Nice
---
Seems like an interesting brawler.
---
no
---
How the fuck are you not dead?
---
The reason why I thought of this idea was because waiting for a star power to show up in the shop can be tedious sometimes. I‚Äôve been waiting for robo retreat and invisiheal to show up in my shop for nearly 3 weeks. So this feature if it was ever added, would save me and a lot of people a heck lot of time.
---
Same, I basically only play brawl ball, brawlers who are bad in brawl ball I push in duo and some even in Gem Grab (Mortis Penny Pam)
---
LMFAO makes sense now.

---
Well I am  struggling to upgrade my brawler cuz of lack of coins
---
  So I like this idea
---
Thanks I don't get many comments like this
---
Why so people make these when the potrait is clearly not gonna change when you equip a skin .-.
---
Yeah. I wasnt that bad when I had 1k, I just want to play the game and not sit on a load screen for 5 minutes
---
Relax. You‚Äôll get them. It takes a bit of time to process.
---
bruh you didnt even play any games it says 3/3 partidas and partidas means matches in spanish i guess
---
Brawl stars is well famous in western countries...... Here meeting a guy who plays brawl stars is more rarer than getting all 4 legendaries.
---
what no hes tied with leon and crow (normal walking)
---
You‚Äôre serious about wanting noobs on your team rather than decent players?
---
And then u find out block friend requests button
---
idiot he means he never got star points from previous seasons from what i see this affected many people
---
Love this!
---
Just a map I made for the game.
---
Thanks, you helped a lot.
---
Uhh sir he said that his comment had more effort than the post
---
Where do u get those brain images?? I could find a meme only having 4 of them
---
That's because the season ended a few minutes ago, those   matches are for the new season. I didn't get my starpoints either.
---
He is in matchmaking
---

---
You got one, not the four
---
I now know when you are born
---
\*evil laughing\*
---
What
---
Woah that's so cool!
---
BRUHHHH today‚Äôs my birthday too! Btw happy birthday!
---
you like Jessie don‚Äôt you?
---
I hate furry that have an blue phlegm on his nose
---
Perfect comment, you should had 100 upvotes
---
yes grasshopper, he is no bull. He is support so in 3v3 just poison every one with poke damage. Emphasis on POKE DAMAGE!!
---
In showdown its hard to explain, he just goes beast mode. It just takes practice and experience to get good in showdown. Just go ham. He is the best brawler so... (in my opinion)
---
Like I said in the OP, trophies don‚Äôt always indicate player skill. There‚Äôs plenty of 5k+ players who suck and there‚Äôs also noobs who aren‚Äôt bad. If they‚Äôve got a couple brawlers they are good with then I don‚Äôt mind at all
---
This looks fricking dope! Happy Birthday my fellow Brawler! Man, I bet that cake looks and taste good! Tell the Cake Maker that I live this!
---
we need a subreddit that‚Äôs just dark skinned brawlers and it can be nsfw if you want it to be
---
Wait, what changed
---
I can do it
---
i do both when i‚Äôm in the character selection screen ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
Also with his super, try to get the most out of these three things.
---
jump
---
landing
---
and how fast it is
---
Sure
---
nice! i like it
---
I gave credit to the original one in the title though.
---
Or a rosa skin in general
---
Details Very nice üåπ
---
I think you get better luck at low trophies, back when I had about 500 trophies, I got Leon. At about 10k trophies, I got Crow (now I have about 12k)
---
I also have crow at lvl 8 still pushing to rank 25, tips: don't use auto aim with super, or else ur super didn't deal damage to the enemy, unless the circle is bigger than the brawler like hiest box, robot boss (not the three small one) etc.(long right üòÇ)
---
So basically stealing the whole community‚Äôs idea and getting congratulated on it being your own...
---
[removed]
---
You really seem to not understand, get lost
---
I used Nita twice with okay resluts. then I used Colt and we won in 30 seconds.
---
Now using insults, nice
---
Now that I think about it I need to use Darryl more
---
There shouldn‚Äôt be solo modes in power play at all. They‚Äôre almost entirely luck based games. Find 2 people to play with you and you won‚Äôt have to worry.
---
Well at least you tagged me so that is fine ;)
---
All i get is star powers which i really dont care about cuz they gud
---
well I don‚Äôt know seeing this filter before it isn‚Äôt that interesting to me
---
F in the chat
---
HAHA BRO U MADE ME LAUGH TAKE MY UPVOTE
---
Which brawlers and star powers should I use for each mode? I only have bull, dynamike, and Tara but I don‚Äôt get very many power play trophies. I have both star powers on each of those brawlers.
---
Should‚Äôve made it an upvote
---
You can also tell if they play serious than they turn back into a bot repetitively . This happened to me I lagged out 2 times in less than a second during powerplay. But as soon as I stopped playing powerplay the lag was magically fixed. I felt really bad for my teammates because every time I said I lagged it just felt like an excuse given over and over especially after we played BB games with no lag.
---
This is coiled snake üòÇ
---
It's intentional
---
I'm complaining because it takes so long üò≠
---
I don't know* autocorrect
---
Wtf dude, scream and curse all you want, fuck the others, but don‚Äôt be dumb and damage ur phone tho
---
Dude forreal haha, I was literally shocked though
---
MoRaLly
---
dunno if it's android or just Samsung's also have a thing called game launcher which lets your record high quality gameplay and sounds
---
U gotta manually enable that stuff though
---
same here
---
DLC Not acquired. Action prohibited.
---
The boost stays on the ground PEOPLE
---
Lol üòÇü§£
---
i prefer 8bit honestly
---
It is definitely not a glitch. Every brawler and their accessories can jump on the pads.
---
Why was last season‚Äôs power play 15 days? Genuine question.
---
randoms are all bad so trophies dont matter
---
Other Brawlers haven‚Äôt got 3rd Star Powers
---
No
---
Yeah... I dit dat oncr
---
Yeah üëç
---
Would‚Äôve been much better if the letters behind her were erased imo
---
I only saw 2 at the time
---
I hate people who makes memes about how sandy's attack deal damage. READ THE DAMN DESCRIPTION ABOUT THE ATTACK, IT SAYS HE THROWS SAND WITH **SHARP PEBBLES**
---
why are they still existing ?
---
I want this
---
Happy birthday I now I'm a little late but ok
---
Lisend here, you little shit
---
Well next update will be huge so you never know. (Maybe this is Santa's present to the community)
---
Brawl stars but its a shitty filter with shitty editing
---
yeah, only epic, never legendary...
---
i think sandy is good
---
sandy shouldnt really counter tanks by himself anyway, but he has the speed to escape them. also, the speed of his attack is really fast so if your ambushing someone then its impossible for them to dodge it. sandy has decent damage, keep in mind that he can three shot whatever mortis can three shot. his attack also pierces, making him pretty good against groups of brawlers, and his speed imo makes him pretty strong against tanks. his playstyle is unique, but his main attack playstyle is similar to nita. also his super is the same size as emz
---
Ahh the best legendary...
---
Without the 12526271 nerfs he got
---
Cool i am at 14k + and yesterday i got My second legendary brawler, sandy
---
How do you add the filter?
---
Thanks man I really understand you I just could have this reaction, I saved 100+ boxes, the fucking first boxI got the legendary I wanted the most
---
so if i gave away my leon, would i get friends?
---
But yesterday I reached 14k thanks to him xD
---
Merci mec
---
Less than others man my lil brother got both Leon and Spike before I got Crow and he started BS 1 month after me
---
Merci
---
I have the video of the pack opening but it takes 8 min and I "only" got tara's star power and gems
---
Oh sorry man for the screams but I was so happy man I saved 100+ boxes and then the first is Crow
---
Still no patch lol
---
How the fk has this not received an award yet, I only have one Silver left and it goes to u bud
---
that was natrual.
---
which star power
---
also wtf the turret missed the stationary safe a few times
---
why i dont get it
---
Hi.. Can i record this gameplay and post it on my Youtube channel (Lang Buaya Gaming)?
---
I will put your Reddit name in this video :)
---
cuz i dont play with these brawlers as often may be..and i try to keep every brawler at same power level..currently almost all the brawlers are at level 7, except for the newly released ones.
---
Best way to earn starpoints; keep on playing with one brawler untill you get to 500 trophies. Why didnt I knew about this earlier??
---
&amp;#x200B;

Very amazing art!

---
Hey, you also know frank got little bit change, me too üòÇ

thanks very much

Demoman Dynamike

Lol

No, you can't change my mind
---
brian
---
I thought it was patriotic leon
---
I think she's a bit too old for a 10 year old
---
It was supposed to be, hey, bum bum bum
---
you can edit comments
---
You're probably older than the average brawl stars player lmaoooo.
---
**spike instantly becomes op**
---
that's quite high
---
How do you fu**ing not know who posted when you just took a screenshot bi***
---
I got Leon before i install the game
---
my reaction to this post in a post
---
I push colt in takedown and Leon/crow etc in lone star lol..
---
Couldn't agree more
---
My freinds with spike crow or sandy
---
Me:c'mon why cant i get pam or bibi (ik its bad shut up)
---
Plsssssssss
---
That Rico carry
---
That‚Äôs pretty low
---
brawler max...
---
You won't get it
---
The freaking levels
---
You only traced
---
This is actually based off of old darryl concept art so that's sorta neat but the original sketch was by noneother then Paul from the brawlstars team who designs all the brawlers
---
Jester?
---
Love it!

My first post
---
All I wanted was a pepsi... JUST ONE PEPSI!
---
Thanks man

r/emojipolice please don't arrest me...

"Account phishing"..?
---
Another there is*
---
I liked the hand on her face
---
Press contact support..
---
Ok thanks
---
Basically just press the button in the top right corner that opens a menu right before you press play.
---
ITT: Skillless trash complaining about solo modes they can't win in because spinning and camping don't work.
---
put it there now
---
Im actually cool with spike not having a voice
---
Carl is actually a top brawler though
---
Can't wait to see it
---
sorry „Ö†„Ö°„Ö† I like coca-cola

Doesn't that mean you're a fool?

Cool illustration but I cannot imagine how this guy will move xd

Foto de tus brawlers con sus puntos de fuerza

I got Leon at 2k
---
Safe to say I am not family anymore
---
You can edit titles on YouTube
---
What ever, can you find the real artist to prove that ???
---
Then it will be 300 gems and everyone will wish it wasn't real
---
man, you‚Äôve 80 trophies. until 200/300 lvl 1 is the normal power to people that play the game in a regular basis
---
Yeah
---
Haha ü§£
---
I am 7k, got 0 legendary...
---
Best of luck for you warrior!
---
Deserves more upvotes anyone who doesn‚Äôt love upvote is just jealous they don‚Äôt have the skills to make this
---
The time has come
---
*loads love and affection beam * uh hey can you stand still for 6 seconds ?
---
THEY‚ÄôLL NEVER KNOW WE GIVE NO WARNING
---
I‚Äôm glad
---
Same I only got Shelly, Bull, Mortis, and just got primo to pwr 9 two days ago that‚Äôs all
---
Lol stolen
---
When you have to flex your trophy count on the kid with cancer
---
What abot friends?
---
Playing Tara because I don't have Crow
---
Stop being a bitch
---
I was gonna say shovel but i instantly realized that a shovel is actually a good weapon
---
Lone star - fuck it i(ts true)
---
takedown- Well yes, but actually no
---
Keep fightingü§ú
---
The trick is to get all brawlers to at least rank15, then pushing rank 20s to rank21 every season.
---
Bcz u hav.. wait what
---
Idk man
---
Ah thanks you too buddy....wait.....why does it taste like this ?
---
F to all who thinks is stoled,IS NOT, good art have a nice day
---
They don't have enough people to review all those replays
---
Sorry to say, but this is stolen artwork I don‚Äôt think this art stealer deserves credit
---
What did u do
---
uh oh, I didn't think he should have done that..
---
lol i just got spike to lvl 9 today, but even with balls of fire, i already lost twice
---
Your post has been removed, make sure to use the body of a post to elaborate on the title.
---
thank you so much have a nice day
---
Dude, literally after u opened that u had the same amount of boxes left as before, so u didn't actually unlock crow.
---
Honestly they should make a penalty list and have some sort of punishments for power play, like:
---
Self-score in brawl ball
---
AFK in a match
---
Use shelly in gem grab and lose the game.
---
And honestly, playing with randoms and winning should give more power play trophies such as +40 because with randoms it shows that you can carry the team despite being in a disadvantage of not having a fixed team comp and communication.
---
Also matchmaking NEEDS to be improved, I'm 16k and I always get a 2.5k, 5k, 8k or 10k inexperienced teammate who does literally nothing throughout the whole match.
---
I have leon with 3k tropheis
---
what did you do
---
I like the map idea although it looks a little too big for a Heist map
---
r/eyeblech
---
Im gona go check the guy who really did this and im going to say something really nice to him and also stop stealing someones work for upvotes ok you snake
---
Don't accuse anybody without proof.
---
r/cursedimages
---
cuz i like brawl stars
---
r/brawlstars... assemble.
---
Bro yu have the exact same chances as me except I have 1 legendary
---
bro üòéüí™
---
Stop stealing art
---
Bottom left.
---
Using a baseball bat or your bare hands against actual guns is pretty transcended too
---
So what? Not everybody is gonna use their Reddit name. That's not solid proof unless you know the original artist then no need to accuse somebody.
---
wtf
---
Look at the bottom left.
---
And... Are they are good?
---
money? which brawler throws money?
---
BACOBIPER,ü§îü§î

Why did you post it just now then

---
Congrats Dude We All Love And Respect People Like You
---
Woah nice work!
---
Ummmm.... no. I‚Äôm allow to joke. Now stop botting upvotes for yourself and leave.
---
Cool...Carl is also one of my favourites.
---
Because unlike u, he probably isnt shit at the game
---
This isn't something I needed or wanted to see today. But hey I'm upvoting it anyway.
---
That skin looks extremely detailed, it's amazing too
---
Pepsi man 2.0
---
My brother got Sandy and Pam in 1 big box at 1100 trophies, he is kicked out of the house successfully
---
here the [link](https://youtu.be/_S7WEVLbQ-Y) for that anime girl‚Äôs manga
---
I already bought road rage carl before, when he was not on sale for 80 gems...rip me I guess..
---
Saving up for the new skin!
---
The worst part about this picture is the fact you have an odd number for tokens
---
Saving this one for the road.....
---
Same
---
Still full legendary team
---
Torty means "cake" in croatian language, actually Torta, but those 2 words are very similar haha
---
Its always fun pretending its a pack opening or something
---
Plz tell me at the end Colt and Shelly will marry
---
This is a cool format...first time seeing Leonard carl being angry lol.
---
Where is spike?
---
D-did something happen, OP?
---
thank you
---
I didn't know sorry
---
Can you tell me How should you look
---
Flair this as "Bug"
---
I love that skins, but unfortunately dont have gems for it :(
---
Ha lol, I got them all
---
Removed - Your post is too short, please expand on your title.
---
Seems legit
---
How biut a friggin a gun
---
Well pros say that he is still the weakest legendary...but actually in a 1v1 crow wins against leon because he deals more damage at range.
---
Yeah true not kidding
---
ok thank you i will
---
Wait for the ban lmao. It‚Äôll happen.
---
I have leon and spike, no crow...But I want him..
---
F... You! Why you postbit 8979 times! Good cake
---
Pepsi Man 3.0
---
it deals more damage right
---
Thanks

Gotta go fast! Run legendaries, run!

Where is spike???

haha ok pepsi man
---
Avengers
---
I am confusion
---
who uses money
---
that's ok hahha
---
That's a good looking cake OP 
---
How'd it taste
---
That plant doesnt look like a cactus, but the face is the same as Spike lol
---
I mean yeah. Just play some Billie Eilish and they'll be dead in no time. Or brawl-o-weens menu theme. Whichever works.
---
Congrats im free to play too also how much trophies you where before the trophy inflation
---
Like it ! but you ok?
---
It‚Äôs phishing, but I didn‚Äôt tried to share, someone hacked to my account

Rico has a 53% win-rate on this map &amp; a Very Low pick-rate. Rico pros dominate with him but there are much easier brawlers to play for the vast majority of players

I dont think anyone does

And How you got 1000 star points for 3 days

I dont think you got brawler above 549 and even that you wont get that much and the power play season ended and for 1 day before the season end wont give you that much

Stay strong ‚úä‚úä‚úä

I want leon
---
Why not tho
---
Usually there is 5-6 daily deals
---
I was thinking about this a little more, probably the people willing to spend money on the game are also willing to spend data. Or at least have played enough to know that the lag seems to magically disappear if you disable WiFi.
---
That is my operational mode, anyway. Every time I'm going to play BS I flip my WiFi off first. It's super annoying and I'd rather be playing on a tablet, but it's what I have to do to be able to enjoy the game without constant lag and frustration.

Sick shot

Isn't it okey putting so much work into art for Reddit ?

Sandy is like a little golden retriever puppy
---
I'm partnered with BrawlStats.com who as access to Brawl Stars's API. These stats are for brawlers over 700 trophies and are therefore considered competitive for maxed brawlers
---
Thanks for your care but he has already recovered

This is very true!

Who uses money as a weapon again?

#Why does Pam need a remodel?
---
Yes
---
Damn, 64? Minecraft rules bruv.
---
If you have legendaries and cant even finish the trophy road, kill urself. 
---
With 30 brawlers you dont even need to get 500 trophies.
---
We should have a ladder or something like that.
---
I just played with a retarded that have almost every brawler maxed out and cant even kill with lvl 10 leon.
---
actually a lot of them are still level 9 ^^
---
stay strong, pick some power cubes up for me
---
Almost to 12K i got no legendaries but thats crap since im missing MORTIS my fav mhytical ;-; i want Mortis instead of any legendary
---
I though SPC Make require 3D model and now it's only for Bo???
---
I mean I do have 3 legendarys but it took me 3 years
---
Oh no
---
Hope I can do it myself lol. 3D modeling is hard isn't it ?

There's a brawler idea i made a few days ago named shock, he'll be added to the storyüòâ
---
Keep fighting!
---
That was rich af
---
Stay strong bro !
---
ACTUALLY
---
Big brain time

Oh baby a triple!

---
Great job getting over cancer! You are a very strong person!
---
be stong ;)
---
showdown and lonestar are his best modes. can do well in gem grab and brawl ball.your super can do a lot of damage  to heist safe but you can't deal with tanks.
---
be annoying and don't let people heal up(don't risk your life for it). you are fast with small hitbox, you can dodge a lot. super jump on throwers or brawlers with low health. piper brock gene 8bit pam nita carl jessie(turret) are bad matchups. you can't kill tanks fast enough but you can keep them on low health.
---
Everytime rico bullets bounce, they increase their radius by 1 and 1/3 tiles. So if there was a colt rico team, colt could do a 1 tile hole with super.
---
Then : |rico-&gt;| and he would be impossible to kill if he would do it 3 times because he would heal 6000 a second.

---
The Venn diagram is so perfect...
---
My friend installed brawl stars on his birthday, pushed to 700 trophies in a few hours, then got spike
---
Correct. These are my personal suggestions for Star Powers. Most of the time, the Brawler you pick is more important than the Star Power üëç
---
The symbol in trophy road is a reference to beta days of brawl stars(and the original coin logo)
---
even the skin looks like little brother.
---
:/
---
OTL Oh sorry I can't code
---
This is just gif copy and music mp3 copy
---
If you watch my Youtube video you will know
---
haha have a nice day
---

I mean I know that, minus the chance that increases as you open boxes. But I'm glad I won't have powerpoints waiting in every box until the next brawler opening. Currently only at 0.8000+%though
---
But what are the odds that he would only stand in one place to only heap himself. He would heal 600 a second not 6000. Also I nerfed it to 10 hp per bounce in a repost
---
very thank you
---
mercy piper would be cool
---
thank you so much
---
You are literally using emojis right now
---
Tara is so cute :(‚ù§Ô∏è
---
i like pepsi 
---
For real. It's by far my most played mobile game and their F2P system is extremely fair.
---
It was a recent clip where a Brock in Safe Zone shot a Nita, Jessie and Penny all on low health and died together.
---
Too far TOO FAR BACK PEDAL BACK PEDAL BA-
---
Considering they all died while his whole team survived and was on the enemy side, I‚Äôd assume so
---
*satisfaction*

I really love it!

what do you mean?

Oh oküòÇ

I get completely destroyed by Darryl a lot of the time in brawl ball.

Same thing happened to me.
---
He was busy fighting cancer but you‚Äôre busy tapping on your phone
---
I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs how Spanish works
---
No its not sir! I have and inbuilt fps counter and it is still locked to 60. Please look into it
---
Thanks!
---
Oh yeah üòê

It's your first time using an editor or you spent 2 hours looking for sound effects? You just slapped all random, screaming sound effects you found and blew my ears off, in a bad way.
---
3 days ago? Omg, impressive
---
3 wins with Poco
---
Diamond can be broken easily. It can only be scratched by other diamonds tho
---
Bet you can't make amazing skins as well
---
Brawl stars skins are the best
---
*BABY A TRIPLE
---
That‚Äôs so nice!!!
---
If you have a diamond moving at a fast enough rate, like at the end of a drill, it'll break through other diamonds. Of course it can be scratched, but it can also be broken through
---
You should join r/resditHWhelp since you clearly need to be at school

Im a Roman Catholic but I think inshallah sounds funnyüòÇ
---
Same, I have 6 maxed brawlers and I'm able to upgrade the other oned TWICE, from level 7 to 9
---
It‚Äôs can also be pipers bombs if you remember
---
Why does your device sounds like a bomb?
---
It means if god wills
---
*golden garbage bag among other garbage bags*
---
Randoms are never this stupid (unless they started the game) this player went afk so a bot took over and bots are stupid.
---
There's literally no devteam better than Digital Extremes (Warframe creators)
---
Posts in new is weird
---
Bad memes, complaining about mm, pointless posts, repost and etc.
---
Ik but if I‚Äôm like serious I would use amen instead of inshallahüòÇ
---
I'll make a video that shows how to do it
---
I'm sorry but Emz doesn't need a nerf
---
Thanks for your marketing lesson, I'm saving so much boxes (90 and 9big) so I will find some gems, and I bought the skin
---
Did you unlock leon for him? If so your a real hero :)
---
U deserve it :)

---
thanks bro :)
---
Thanks for the response I also had your problem and restarting it fixed the problem, but now my problem is that every button, icon, the time, and everything else is 20% smaller. It's like when you're on desktop and change 100% to 80%. Is there a way I can restore to default settings?
---
Nvm
---
keep it up bro
---

---
The Last time I bought a box from a shop, I got back half of my gems
---
Congrats dude
---
I love it
---
Panda nita in the back one of these things is not like the other
---
My pp in 3 a.m.....................stone cold,frozen,can cut diamonds,and about to die
---
Aparently through recent news it was a group of members, but ir seems that both gangs are neutral
---
so cute, the dog
---
I don‚Äôt even play this game but I just nutted seeing that
---
NICE MMMMMMMMMMMM YES THIS IS NOICE
---
I did the same
---
 I didn't watch the tutorial, I looked at the picture on the cover of the video and drew it up.
---
Can you show me what the new lone stars "Four Boroughs" look like?
---
Oh wow hi ur here, yeah he is pretty awesome for doing that
---
The music at the end...
---
Thank you it took a long time I took the time to add shading and giving it a background
---
This is really hard to read .
---
White on white doesn‚Äôt work
---
Equilateral triangle is "perfect" triangle?
---
Yay more coins
---
Good idea though
---
sure why not
---
I agree, but give him a mechanic that gives a speed boost after a kill but decrease his health to 3800 so he is tanky but not quite. Also his second star power could be... Dem drives the school bus, which gives it an added speed boost, increased duration, and the ability to chase after people and zone them. As for the name, idk. Hope this helped!
---
Amazing quality
---
I recommend Colt with Ambush as well
---
well it was a joke but good for him that hes well
---
–ê—Ö–∞—Ö. –ù–∞ –º–µ—Å—Ç–µ!

His super uses mentos dropped into pepsi bottles. When enemies step on them, the bottles open and explode
---

---
Boo no imagination
---
Wait, do skeletons still have tongues? Besides that, nice skin icon!
---
If you haven't decided yet try with poco or barley
---
Brock: Brock is OP
---
Me who can have like 5 more brawlers on level 9 but has 200 coins: Hah
---
This is so sweet! ‚ù§
---
Looks like a puddle blood on the ground
---
First, do you recommend upgrading Pam or 8-Bit to Power Play? I have Shelly, Piper, Leon and Poco maximized, only. Second, I have a team but they are not very good there. How can we train 3x3?
---
Is Penny a kid?
---
Lmao
