 I never seen outlaw colt on my main, and always see  linebacker bull. It's massively a recolor of touchdown bull
---
R u sure you didnt trace? It looks traced but still, it looks great!

Thx:)

It's why the wish didn't work out

Mortis forgot to wear his hat

por quanto tempo?

The difference is the left is more quality than the right one. While the right one text are made from Baxtrix (dont search his name on yt pls just don T)

Why are star powers impossible to pull now? I got spike before getting a star power and I still have like 7 to find

Removed - DO NOT SUBMIT POSTS WITH TITLES IN ALL CAPS. CAPS LOCK IS CRUISE CONTROL FOR COOL

LOL think he/she add the "it's not traced" part because her last post was getting a lot of hate too. Post got removed cuz she was begging for upvotes but tracing and claiming it's not traced is honestly equally as bad if not worse.
---
My favorites brawlers: Penny, Bibi, Piper
---
Funnier that the primo got super by hitting the bull in his super
---
And Mortis lmao
---
69 lmao
---
It‚Äôs not fun for the player who gets cheated. Supercell is changing their mind. It‚Äôs fraud in SOLO. Those that want to team have lots of other modes. It should result in a permanent ban.
---
You forgot discord
---
Even if you didn't trace, just drawing those is still a pretty huge waste of time. Drawing what you see isn't hard or creative.
---
Its there to tell you to stop playing without forcing you to stop
---
True, poor throwers getting the blame when mortises themselves team

It's annoying with him sniping you a log distance away when he's a "close range damage" brawler

r/mortisgang

I think season rewards should come back, but be halved, since star points exist now I guess
---
Nice one.
---
No one said it couldn't be done in the old siege I got 33 bolts
---
well, true
---
why is leon so white and crow so blue
---
Darryl is the only brawler with an auto filling super
---
Imagine needing a fish to hurt people
---
I got this sorting by best
---
Same
---
Funny thing is that it would just be ‚Äúhala ba la Laba, hababbalala ba al baba‚Äù if he were to say it
---
Mortis New starpower : when he attack he goes trough corners 
---
That would be perfection
---
All of your posts are karma-begging, how is this art?
---
Yes. His the only one. Shelly and Bibi both have abilities that fill automatically associated with their star powers, but Darryl‚Äôs is the only super.
---
Link meme? Pls
---
Yes, karma-beggers who claim tracing/pixelatingn is art are really bad.
---
Chrono, you had the same idea as me.

Id put Brock and leon in the biker gang as well

I know

But that‚Äôs only from star power

I'd be mad if I get last place for that centre left spawn position.

Love it! But the Shelly and Colt one is better

Which mode did you play
---
Impressive! I have a request, or should I say, a challenge, for you. I have created a concept for a new brawler, and all I need is the art for him. Your artwork perfectly resembles the brawl stars style, making you the perfect guy to help me out. Interested?

This is actually a great idea
---
Oh ok!
---
Um. What? He‚Äôs not rare at all. Very common. Very very good at just about any mode and map.
---
Yes, because of the meaning of the star powers. See: both star power heal an ally/yourself. The same happen with "fire" star power like brock and el primo.
---
Traced

Yes pls

I know but...

Whatever

When the match is about to start,3 brawlers will be offered to the 5 brawlers team to vote for 1 to be banned. One of them is the brawler the big brawler choosed,and the ither 2 are fakes. The brawler with more votes will be banned. If the 5 brawlers team bans the brawler the big brswler was going to use,the big brawler has to choose another brawler from the collection he/she has and then the match will starts (Also the 5 brawlers team may be awarded with xp points or some coins)
---
If the brawlers banned a fake brawler,the big brawler will use the brawler he wanted from the beginning and the match will start normally.
---
I remeber it. I remember... Power points.
---
Dude, I'm not what you think, I've been playing for over a year and think life leech needs to come back.
---
I clearly would‚Äôve been shot by the piper. The problem is that there‚Äôs to much value for the two people that spawn around you to just trap you. Yeah I coulda maybe pushed the bibi, but dodging her attack would‚Äôve required me to get closer to the piper which would‚Äôve given her an easy shot. There was no way to get out of that ( that I can think of), especially considering how aggressive they were both playing. Which is usually the case when you spawn at the spawn. You‚Äôre in between two people and most of the time they both push you. It‚Äôs just a bad map.
---
if you are going to post a bring 'back life leech' post then atleast put some effort and try to explain why it should be added back
---
8000 trophies?

I want to lick that spikes balls

Thank you for that U in honour much appreciated.

Good he jumped away from the enemy Bull and Rico. Good Primo
---
Thanks
---
This is still in the game. Discovered while data mining. You have to be xp level 999 and it will show up. Why? Dunno.
---
Haha, really bro?
---
exept for the fact that mostis is an old man
---
i CROSSPOSTED it
---
Why is the Rico grey?
---
Guess u can
---
This is from radical Rosh everyone he is a amazing youtuber and he also made a dancing Tara you should all check out his channel
---
They could just make a save replay function at the end of each battle
---
What's wrong
---
wrong, it belongs to dynamike
---
I have a feeling that somebody will do it.... you know  what i mean
---
Why don't you just draw Brock? You could make it.
---
It should be free. And that's a great price.
---
Darius is my name, making the entire subreddit mad is my game
---
You should have used Tick
---
I have 7.3k sp
---
why ? most of my mega boxes were bad. i've opened like 10 of them and none of them had a brawler
---
Wtf is ur flair than
---
this combination is so cool, love it!
---
I would've but I had 1 ticket left I betted it not expecting to be the boss as leon and it happend so I decided to let them kill me if I knew I was gonna be the boss I would've used tick
---
do you have crow ?
---
Supercell is really collaborating with EA. For starters mirror is similar to imitiater in Pvz2 and the zombies also look quite similar to brawl stars characters there are also some features in brawl stars that are similar to Pvz2 in every way but I forgot. XD
---
Use me as a cringe button
---
Oh. I bet 1 ticket on tick 11 times all unsuccessful
---
All you did was pass the ball
---
If you were over 4k when Tick was released you already got the mega box, and then you got tick aswell, since I was under, I never got the megabox, only tick.
---
So those of us under 4k missed out on a free megabox
---
Lol I was thinking about suggesting that but was too lazy to. 100% for it
---
The only bot is you.

Damn that's an F

Oh. Yes Bull is very bad guys. But I don't know why I still love him. LOL
---
Pretty useless tbh

I just did that today

it doesn't matter. you wouldn't have got a lot from the mega box

Back in the good old days when barley could deal 45 percent damge with one super..mm
---
Poco helped primo with the bow lmao
---
I know I have to have crow but anyways it's annoying
---
What was the Shelly's total trophies?
---
Im with you brother
---
It's less than 8
---
*it would satisfy both groups of people and wouldn't change the game mode at all
---
The only problem is that the waiting time would be longer due to the increase in game modes

---
Lmfao. Hot Maze, Passage and Eye of the Storm are all hot Garbage.
---
Jk
---
pure quality stuff, good job, i can see how much effort you put there
---
Nice charging up your super to escape being cornered
---
Alot of them are meme-y way to complain about the game

U see rico's alot

Why you downvoting this guy? Maybe he dont know that this meme is stolen and stupid? he is not even said something bad or good, u just downvoted a neutral guy!

Mortis does not need a buff, THIS CAMPAIGN NEEDS TO DIE.
---
I think im better at photoshoping, and its funny that im browsing that format too now :)
---
Nah, Burnt Penny
---
So many skins and all of them suck. (Well, the beach one is nice)
---
Also everyone don't forget the season rewards and watch add to get double reward from the boxes
---
And the list is tall
---
And with coiled snake if you're on low HP HE WILL INSTANT TRANSMISSION ON YOUR ASS.
---
Like if you thought images in the mirror are closer than they appear then think again because this dude just got better at chasing your ass.
---
Pam Star Power
---
And just a moment after that, bull dies
---
I think they will give Red skins for the special event they always do. The Supercell Red campaign where the raise money for Charities and other helpful events. Maybe we can get a limited Red Skin then
---
I am damn serious.

Quack

Happy Cake Day
---
Rey beat a rosa with mortis.
---
Any one with close range loses to shelly does that mena they need a buff? No.
---
And with bull you're fucked no matter who u are if your close, except shelly of course.
---
Shes broken.
---
Mortis dont need buff simply because he gets hard countered by a few brawlers.
---
Shelly negs all close range. Does that mean they should buff bull or el primo?.
---
No need for buff
---
Hot maze and passage is good maps
---
Balanced &amp; good spawn places
---
But eye of the storm is such a sucks
---
Horrible spawn places
---
Also the bushes not properly arranged

---
he swapped shelly's star power to bibi its a glitch its really fun man
---
Report for being spike
---
Good old days, for no reason they changed it
---
I know he used to deal like 25% or more damage to the safe but it was equally risky to go to close to enemy spawn
---
His super was like risk or reward
---
Even when you use it to enemy
---
Either you miss the ehole super or melt them down

Not for teaming

And also there's some maps in the game also have so much teaming like skull creek and Rockwall brawl
---
And also I suggest the life leech for some of this maps to make it without teaming
---
Also I love hot maze with Mortis so much

And I hate teaming

Do not judge quickly to me my friend

Also sorry for my bad English

Tnx to new trophy system, this is 450+ trophies match now lol

Hate this map with a passion

-Full of camping shotgunners
---
-horrible spawns where you can get insta killed 
---
-bushes allow anyone to catch u off guard 
---
-camping is the best way to win but is also the best way to lose
---
-did I mention all the camping Bulls, shellies, primos, &amp; rosas
---
Something fierce coming out
---
On that map you would see atleast 4 people teaming per match, please don't bring it back.
---
Yes, that's it. We probably can buy Tara for 350 but that opportunity seems random too so discount is purely cosmetic. 
---
BTW, 350 even can be the real Tara price SC use when generating boxes content. Now  350/30 = 11.6 big boxes on average to get something worth 350 (Tara is not guaranteed. If you have managed to roll Tara class brawler it should be divided by brawlers count you don't have). But that's true only if Supercell boxes are fair. So its at least 11.6 big boxes. 
---
350 can also be overpriced compensation for not testing your luck with boxes. 
---
Its kinda black box for real.
---
Why tf did you steal a clip from a BBC documentary of eagles and posted it here?
---
I did a game yesterday where our team (penny, colt, bull) won the first siege with 2 bolts. We got their safe to 2% and lost all sieges after that. The other team (pam, dynamike, rosa) wasn't able to make our safe below 2%
---
Okay, maybe I am wrong, but months ago there was a post with this joke but different picture
---
Rip Bull, can't take a shotgun and sacrifice everyone
---
Ya like  you have spike

Me: use bull super to break the walls which is running track

Why did they change it?

Solo Showdown is just unplayable. I switched to duo.
---
But then you come back invincible
---
Probably because it's too op

Imagine getting mid and getting all 9 boxes
---
Wait that‚Äôs illegal you can‚Äôt form a team 4 brawler

Yes, why is that?

You still wrote that you thought it was cool if they added it

yeah this happens too often because of teamers pollluting every game. btw that video was too long.
---
In that week i needed 1 more gem to buy summer jessie with good deal 39 gems. And i opened 20 boxes including 3 big 1 mega and 16 small boxes and got nothing(but got 2 shelly starpowers) and i just dunno why, maybe supercell curse me???
---
3 rounds or 5 rounds
---
Why did you say "coming soon"? I mean, no offense but , people mostly dont care if there is a new brawler idea
---
If the damage dealt to you immediately after the totem has been consumed does more than that 2 hearts, you would die anyway, so it wouldn't be the same as Shelley's band-aid power.
---
**SCARED AS FRICC**
---
Rico's head....

Go to r/brawlstars and click 3 dots, then choose "change user flair"

That happened to me to

Yes beacuse i dont like duo xD
---
Sans tara
---
It says whore in russian
---
Ah ok, My Barley is 300 and Mortis is 600+. Anyway it doesn't have any meaning. I don't see Mortis any dangerous while playing any brawler. Even with Dynamike and Barley it is pretty easy to kite Mortis.
---
What is the first clip from?
---
Cool concept, but the star power seems op.
---
Token doubler is the most valuable thing you can buy with gems. Specially if you are F2P and it has a discount.
---
lol I didn't mean to offend you. It was the clich√© joke about Mortis and throwers

i realy like the black mecha crow skin. far more than the other mecha skins available in the shop

Wow! Thanks so much! I‚Äôll try my best at robo spike, had another suggestion to do half Sakura and half regular and now I‚Äôve got one for robo! Low key a good problem to have! I‚Äôll do some weighing up and see others opinions as well to make my final verdict, but thanks so much for your thoughts, I appreciate it :D

0.0249 I think(sth really close to that

 Tick w.no super is hardcore

The bots will not respawn when the boss is constantly hit between intervals
---
They softly force you to buy gems ;) it is an accident, it is marketing strategy
---
The posts about this joke being overused are now more overused than the joke ever was..
---
These maps are only for individual type of brawler.So I don't like them
---
Wow 4k and crow.. sad
---
Haha thanks
---
Hey do me a favor can u sub to me and I sub to u on yt
---
upvoted because Colt
---
Never saw any memes about it, only the joke in brawl talk .-.
---
Because EA bought PopCap? Sure publisher and developer are technically different. But EA is calling the shots. Otherwise PopCap likely would have released at least one good game sometime in the last ~8 years.

That. Is. Crazy.

Thanks :D

The hair color don't means nothing

Oh. My. God.

My god, your art is AMAZING

Actually he was OP in 2018 (too).
---
No, this will never work.
---
Frank's da best
---
they team more
---
Meanwhile there's me who bought a mega box for a discount and got nothing not a long time ago.
---
Should be more like 1000 coins = 10 gems
---
YA, #what he's good at?
---
Repeatable
---
ngl its pretty good for a community made map. could see it having a decent meta, the \*only\* thing i can criticize is to make less blue barrels in the corner. Good job tho :D
---
i really hope this is satire
---
Relatable

Hey can u sub to me and I me sub u on yt

100% bull

I think they mean when:

Who plays Piper in this map?
---
you replayed to more than one ‚Äúunderrated‚Äù comment and they were a couple hours ago, clearly it didn‚Äôt have much support back then use ur brain
---
They‚Äôre only doing that to make it seem like they‚Äôre doing something and don‚Äôt get backstabbed.
---
Do you even know wonderbrad lol
---
I‚Äôve already blown up once, so I had to load a previous save.
---
Oh yes I remember killing a team of 14 power drinks in duos as a 2 power drink barely at 400 health as they followed me around a corner good times
---
F
---
also are you a smash ultimate player or brawl player
---
Sometimes I forget this sub is full of children
---
Idk
---
9 trophies &lt; 5 trophies
---
Idk, but i see people playing Piper sometimes
---
Hmm whenever i see 2 or more mortises they are always teaming
---
Yeah man i use that to scare bulls away in cavern churn, i even defeated some who tried to approach me
---
Kairos is going to be sooooo happy if this gets added in.
---
This is basically for Brawlympics!
---
You pixelated an image of Spike and an image of Leon (in a different post), and then called it "art."

Finally, some good flippin' paper art on this sub! Very cute.

Why not increase the chance of it coming in rotation?
---
#CHUNKS OF FISH

Anyone have the same problem "+" to chat.

I play ultimate

Mmmm no its not
---
Thank you so much!!
---
Because of the reason they removed it
---
Same :)
---
I smell a rat
---
Oh :(
---
Original?
---
They removed it cause new players (idiots) did not know how to play it.
---
r/cursedimagesandcommentsatthesametime
---
Wow dude, what are the odds of matching with like 6 bos having the same expensive skin who also share a common interest of playing sd in the trashiest way possible, though times m8
---
"Leon is getting weak in showdown"
---
**I'm gonna stop you right there**
---
Welp this argument is done if your going to have the mindset that new players are just idiots
---
I think it's a part of crow's dagger
---
That was where I got the idae 4 the runing track
---
Honestly i thought that brawl talk was when you can speak with random teammates
---
Okay
---
Aye long time no see!
---
####i tilted my Leon all the way from 500 to 411
---
pause the replay, as you are hovering your attack brock is already out of the hitbox. but looks pretty weird seeing it for the first time
---
Tara's big brother
---
Probably the heavy sweatshirt
---
No. BS shouldn't encourage going for kills since its simply not the objective. People team because it's the best strategy to get trophies, giving players star points for kills wouldn't change anything, and Showdown has many other problems, tho at this point I would be happy if teaming was gone.
---
I buy big box. 6 gems left. *1 minute later*. See tokens. Me: holy sh*t
---
Hi! I'm from  the future, and cavern churn is back
---
What the fuck have you brought upon this cursed land
---
Or that
---
Yeah get Loaded Rico.
---
Imagine actually play this map I usually play 3v3 when this is back in rotation
---
Basically the 20th repost.
---
Bruh, you never ever outline every single detailed shadow, unless of course you're tracing
---
I said \*\*if\*\*
---
It's called photoshop lol, I dont think that's 11% increase to range lol
---
It kinda makes sense there is literally a dead bear head on Nita‚Äôs head so....
---
best offer ever
---
Yoo that kid was holding his phone rip
---
i LiKe cAlL tHeM LikE tHiS
---
&gt; A mode to defeat everyone
---
Yes
---
&gt; purely on your own 
---
Why do you think so. Win how you can, use whatever you want. Better than boring everyone for himself
---
You meant 8 year olds, not ‚Äúintelligent minecraft and PewDiePie fans‚Äù, am I right?
---
6966 trophies? Cool.
---
Probably the best value in the game rn
---
Like a boss moments #1 xD
---
Nice autofiring
---
I was thinking the same thing
---
Yeah ur right. But it was a pretty confusing moove by him to do the glitch while he was showcasing her range lol
---
thx
---
14 boxes for 39 gems is like 14 mega boxes for 390 gems which is very good
---
So freaking true
---
The map ain't bad, u just have to play shelly or bull and u have 1 or 2 place every time! I just pushed bull to 500 on this map
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ this is so true!
---
100% Red Bull
---
U should of kept your mouth shut
---
No you need 63
---
True, honestly the bar might even be photoshopped too but probably not
---
I would say shock or brelly
---
what's the most gems anyone has seen from a small box? Usually I get 3, one time I got 18!
---
Nah that name was scrapped during the early phases of the construction of this offer
---
Fajny fanart üòéüòéüòé
---
Damn I walk to the bush and there is 2 el primo teaming and beat me up
---
63 to be exact
---
I often do this to detect if I have shot delay so I can prepare to play with lag... I usually change up my play style a bit if I know ahead of time the server is lagging
---
The only thing I don't like is the brown hair, it's hard to notice it, other than that great artwork!
---
Funny idea! But I think Supercell can't add it due to copyright reasons
---
Post this on r/MortisGang
---
Good. Hope you get fuckin banned again.
---
it's simple team and backstab
---
EL PRIMO!!!
---
Darryl is too OP.
---
I dont even have an epic, at 3.8K
---
Am i the only one that plays duo more than solo?
---
Wtf I once made the exact same meme but no one noticed so I deleted it. Rip but still u deserve those upvotes üëç
---
I think 3 is the best choice.
---
I think they have to stay unique imo
---
Wait for them in boxes since getting a star power in a box has a higher chance than opening tons of boxes to get 2000 gold
---
Yo mama jokes arent funny-stop trying to get upvotes
---
I finished the drawing of Crow!  I hope you enjoy my artwork and you can comment on that post what brawler you want to see next!

Yup. With this you‚Äôll get 1000 trophies players with the mecha skins and that‚Äôll *REALLY* piss people off

Yeah, it is inevitable.

Here you come fast boi

Do Mortis next

Everybody in that match was bad tho.. you can tell they have no idea how to play, and the Leon is constantly auto aiming without strafing at all whatsoever.. not really skillful at all ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è just happened to go against bad people, and Leon being OP if you get close and auto aim (which you can't do I high rank)

Instead of a turret Jess summons a

#giant fucking robot mech

and pilots the robot, giving her X5 health, X3 reload speed, X10 damage, and when destroyed causes a massive nuclear core eruptions destroying everything. There is also homing missles to give the teamers a bad time

Every time I get a new brawler

That's bullshit

Where'd you get these?
---
That's way too fast for something with as much health as he has. Maybe make him the same speed as Primo and the other tanks (18% speed increase).
---
That watermark can be easily covered ya know
---
...The thing was...i saw this template at amino, i asked if i could use, he said yes, i didn't know that other one was the creator, and the water mark is so people don't steal and repost.
---
Wtf are you talking about,  trophies have nothing to do with what's unlocked.  Maybe by the time you finally made it to 14k you had everything unlocked,  don't change what i said.  
---
"Literally nothing to use gold on at that level" sure because supercell doesn't add new brawlers every single season.  Moron.
---
You ask for facts,  you've already been given them,  maybe read slower.  
---
The fact is that star points do nothing except let the children play dress up.  
---
The fact is coins purchase upgrades. 
---
I really don't see what's so hard to understand. 
---
Im sure you're not as stupid as you're letting on.
---
one rocket hit will splash a shelly superüëç

Same here I could have gotten road rage carl since he was discounted for 59 gems and I was so unlucky because I had 58 gems

When the guy grabbed the ball, he was facing backwards so the ball was brought into the goal

Good job, it reminds me of one of Ben 10's Aliens that shot lava.
---
supercell addressed u/gedi-kor that they need 3d moddler and he is 2d one. when he will learn fully the will be hired.
---
I think the price should be at least 10,000 star points. Anything less would be meaningless given how much time it takes supercell to develop new brawlers.
---
Bo:I‚Äôm screwed

Just another great art piece by u/ricochann

Tweaks like what? Cause I'm thinking if there's 10 players the map would be way too crowded I mean if the maps were made bigger then maybe but then 3v3 wouldn't work.

I mean this was about 450 trophies, idk what you consider high rank. I wont disagree with you about everyone in the match being bad either

For the most part :P I met some good people from pushing piper with randoms on double trouble and hot point :3
---
Well yes hitting shots is the players problem, you shouldn‚Äôt have to be on the same title as your enemy to deal peak damage when other brawlers can do the same on a different tile. If Darryl is on the next tile over from his opponent, his damage is very inconsistent. While I think he doesn‚Äôt need that much buffing, shortening the width of his basic attack by a 1/3 of a tile or so should do it.
---
In robo rumble, for a 6 minutes game, you'll get 31 tokens per ticket so if you have 20 tickets for 30 gems, you'll get around 33 tickets for 50 gems, so, that'll give you 1023 tokens (if you "survive" for 6 minutes in Robo Rumble), and for 50 gems, you'll get 1000 token doublers, so 1000 additional tokens.
---
That's 23 more tokens from tickets than what you'd earn by buying token doublers.
