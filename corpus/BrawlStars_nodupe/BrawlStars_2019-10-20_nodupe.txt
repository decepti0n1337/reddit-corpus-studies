Mortis is not a vampire. He‚Äôs a mortician.
---
honestly tho, a solid 8/10
---
And I was looking at that with my phone below my waist
---
You might as well just throw if that happens
---
U forgot a brawler in the water(left bottom ) here u think there is a new brawler
---
Nickatnyte?
---
This is beautiful. Rico is so hated on as a basic useless character.
---

---
I mean, this won't change that, but at least now he can lose in style.
---
No
---
Aww damn, my dreams ruined. It's fine, there will probably be many more little shorts with people getting their own voices, maybe not the exact same but I can quench my thirst for more of this brawl Stars animation this way
---
thats just an rpg
---
well now you did

---
Hello there!
---
isn't that the contour of Mortis Mansion? just sayin.
---
That's very understandable
---
I think the silhouette is Mortis Mortuary
---
Post this in the Humor flair it's more better
---
Make his 2nd also remove the pause charge when under 30% hp. Making that HP add more value.
---
The attack still stops him. Just not during the charge. Kind of like Bibi.

Some Toilet Fridge that can only startup

Is.. Nita.. dabbing?

Gene in February, Carl in March, Rosa in April, bibi in May, tick in June, summer break in July, 8 bit August, sandy in September. They‚Äôve pretty steadily released one a month when they‚Äôre working.
---
You kind of copied my list
---
He looks like ‚Äújet the hawk‚Äù
---
He must reach the xp limit so many times i guess
---
Great job dude! Looks like a 10.

Yeah. He copied my list

[Say what!? ](https://s.put.re/6M54tYb6.jpeg)
---
Although I have all legendaries but Sandy. That luck rate is only accumulated since I got my last box brawler (was it Gene?)...
---
Truer words have never been said
---
Well he shoots several of his "thingies" (I don't know what they are called). So from far range, it is most like that only some of his "thingies" will hit an opponent. At close range, all of his "thingies" would hit. Also I am sorry for using "thingies"
---
He looks like joe
---
Exactly
---
Was?

Repost
---
Stop it dude it is a unlisted brawl talk video months ago
---
im just lovin' it
---
Why do you have 6k trophies and rank 19 tara?? I get matched with people like you and they duck if you play good is ok but if not do not. Do that
---
lol
---
No i dont get it cuz its not hard to get 6 players in the match and have 4 staying in a corner, there's a 1v1
---
Oh c'mon.. I don't want too much.. Just 5%-10% from your good luck
---
Wait this is just a frame from the Brawl Talk teaser
---
Bruh it‚Äôs been used like 4 times

---
Well would you have a party without your favorite pizza? That is the reason mortis invited Dinamike.
---
is the power of music
---
Ok
---
Sounds a little broken üòÖ, maybe make it that his super instead reflects the projectiles instead of instant damage?, and he should be a lot slower (this is my opinion), because then people can use him as a shield to deflect shots whenever they want.
---
Again this is just my opinion, but that seems like a neat idea üëå
---
Nice gem count
---
Huh, I'm not sure if that's the case or a benefit for timing it right
---
Thanks!
---
Thanks :)
---
It's still has more effort than the "funny memes" out here
---
Thank you ‚ò∫

Skins to get wins lol
---
bruh I can't believe Family Guy copied the voices of Piper and Mortis from Brawl Stars.
---
Hehe thanks bud
---
I worked with u/Misaki-Sachiko on this map and it been a blast. Her in put help in the making of this map. She is amazing.

I love him!!!

The character does not move except for the swap thing under the bridge, I hope it's a new character and the swap thing is a Gene skin

Add new brawler

Blender, and glitch animation was done in after effects

Yes plus slight dmg buff would be nice too.

No... they got a baby, is a sexual joke .

Damn it that was as loud as the supercell logo sound

Yeaaaaaaa!
---
I only started at the date of global release so that explains it.
---
wow this i would buy if it was in the game. great job and keep it one day i see that skin in the game
---
They didn't. Actually I took a random Bibi and barley, changed the names, manipulated them to look like they'll fight or something but I missed that little detail.
---
Damn it

You're so observative

not everyone can afford perfect makeup and cosplay. They tried their best.

15.5k pro? I dont think so. im at 18.5k and when i found an actual pro in game i got destroyed, 15.5k doesnt mean anything.

Shark Leon: "am I a joke to you"

Why is your username so familiar to me?

Yeah it was weird how they were all trying to mimic their characters' idle positions, like I get it for the sake of cosplay but the costumes were better showcased without it.
---
The rest can kiss my beautiful a$$
---
Thx
---
OH NOO I SAW ITT
---
Blame Aladdin
---
i honestly think smoke trails didn't need the nerf. leon could use a maybe 10 damage buff per blade at close range. sandy's second sp could use a nerf and his main attack could go down to 1100 but that's really it.
---
another way they could nerf sandy is by buffing his counters.
---
That's for next update I think, November. Halloween update is Mortis' Mortuary.
---
I would buy Bikini Mortis
---
they have to be 13 legally to own a reddit account, 13 know what this means as they are of age where their peers talk about it on daily basis.
---
Because the program only allows you to use two voices

I think that‚Äôs a bibi skin
---
WE NEED MORE EXPLODING SHELLY
---
I love this comment
---
Exactly, they just decided on a random time for the sake of making it look like a clock. At this point people will start making theories about a speedboat brawler or some shit.
---
It did!
---
Aww man the reset will destroy everything
---
Good eye
---
Weebs alert
---
It‚Äôs amazing! You must have Sacrificed many hours in making this.
---
I think Leon should be buffed from 616 to 630 damage so he can two shot 5040 health brawlers.

Talking about the leg on the first panel

Where did he say that?

Just because Sandy‚Äôs not as OP as he looks doesn‚Äôt mean he doesn‚Äôt need a nerf.

Yea I think it‚Äôs just a new Tara skin- she‚Äôs the mummy brawler. Maybe the hand under the dock is a new swamp monster brawler?

but the whole attack can last now 5 seconds thats too much
---
I can see the hat sticking out of the rank score frame

What?

I agree also I think I have fought you before username is Sniped btw if that helps

Humour. Very funny, OP. I‚Äôm laughing.

Aaaargh the light mode!

It's the Swamp Monster Gene skin

Bubbles

I had 3 8-bits :D

It‚Äôs a striped swimsuit I think

Yes! Somebody finally did this. I thought I was the only one who thought it was Piper.

With the last patch she can protect herself
---
Do it!
---
The gene grab is epic gamer skills
---
What's the specs of the laptop

This could also make changing your name easier (they could make it so that you could change your name once per year for free for example)

it's called sarcasm . and nobody cares if you were watching it live

shut up men it's a free brawler :)

Serb?

i knew it that it's a new brawler
---
I bet it‚Äôll be 150 gems tho :/
---
For the love of god, please stop making showdown maps in the 3v3 layout. I respect the effort but making a showdown map in a 3v3 layout makes no one want to see it. Put the showdown map in a solo gamemode layout.

ü¶ÄLIFE LEECH IS BACKü¶Ä

Her super is a mobile spike super, honestly its a bit lazy since the last two brawlers super was also an area of effect type super.
---
It would be cool if he shot out a bubble( kind of like bibi but mid range) and the bubble explodes on impact.
---
Free new brawler, yeah.
---
Well.I pushed to 8k a few days ago sooo
---
Let's say it simply. Rule 34 is not for kids or teens.

Holy shit who cares? It was by not even 10 min so it doesn‚Äôt really count as a leak. Big deal.

Couldn't you export it???

Oh thats true... And as i think about it, carl's super also follows him as he moves so that mechanic is old too...
---
So who are you

what is power play?

Spike is the worst legendary brawler

Not really, I'm currently 7500+ trophies and hearing another trophy road brawler release kinda force me to grind again for the sake of the Mega Box

Wow, they have in common so many things, like it is Piper and both are Halloween skins. Amazing, for sure they were iinspirated so much by your skin idea
---
Is it for all of showdown or only a event modifier again?
---
yeah , go ahead and downvote me, that's all you can do. i honestly didnt expect anything more from a kid from r/brawlstars
---
Let's just say it's a thing that only teens and kids can understand
---
Good luck getting to 3000000 trophies bro
---
You predicted it, well done

bruh

Bruh dont spread blizzard propaganda

Im not downvoting..????

No that's not what I meant. It's only for adults.
---
More multi-purpose that you would want to know ;)
---
Honestly, what's the difference?
---
What the fuck do you guys want, when it‚Äôs it free you complain and when it‚Äôs not free you complain. Grow up holy shit
---
And that's the opposite of what I meant
---
He said that this star power is not sure what‚Äôs shown but it‚Äôs a high possibility, so we‚Äôre not sure of neither one
---
yeah ok
---
i was going to lose hope getting the new brawler but then i saw it's another trophy road brawler
---
Frank becomes frankier
---
Yes I completely agree, i dont need Emz when i have crow leon and sandy!
---
Hmmmm it looks like it can heal ppl
---
You  just ended our conversation
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure leon is 80 gems
---
I'm at 10k I gave up on the game but now another free brawler? Time to push another 500 trophies
---
because they are content creators plus they have a big relationship with supercell
---
It's a game mode itself buddy
---
Yeah, my favoutite thing about the update!
---
Hmm?
---
when emz super is activated she heal herself 200 hp per second
---
are you retarded ? how is your statement even related to my reply ? and how many trophies u got noob ? lmao you actually think spike is the worst legandary.

Hello magyar vok

r/AntiEmojiPolice r/EmojiSquad üí™üí™
---
So when is the actual update?
---
What about Piper calavera? she even put some makeups to look just like you, she will be heartbroken to see you like this
---
YES finally they added life leech that you can play in duo also
---
Is your frank at like 500 trophies? Have you ever played him competitvely?
---
That is pretty low but fine
---
i thought it was going to be a mythic
---
What does that mean
---
Buffy????
---
They already have confirmed it. In the ‚ÄòNo time to explain‚Äô video Mortis is a grave digger so he is a Mortician. And the new update teaser featured Morris Mortuary, and a Mortuary is a place where dead bodies are prepped for burial.
---
Everyday, a mode (possibly just solo modes) will have the power play sign. You can only play 3 games per day with maxed out (I think they mean including star power) brawlers only to earn points (I don't know the term). At the end of the season, each player will get star tokens depending on their ranking.
---
Ho
---
Ly
---
Shiet
---
This is by far my favorite update untill now, but i have only one complain...
---
NO MORTIS SKIN??
---
So what you're saying is that Egyptians make a mummy?
---
It just dropped an hour ago :)
---
SanZ
---
Why is the new brawler free? I was really hoping for a new mythic so all rarities above trophy road had exactly 4 brawlers
---
I Will always name it life leech
---
Frank is Frank
---
Thanks for advice :)
---
It's just a meme, relax
---
r/youngpeoplereddit
---
Thank you. I forgot that part and that is a MASSIVE difference. They‚Äôre damaging circles. That‚Äôs where they similarities end.
---
I deny it all
---
Stop trolling dude just watched it again and they did not
---
the furry inside me wants this very much
---
..
---
Because they had something to actually say instead of spamming ‚Äúfirst‚Äù
---
Judging by their lengthy comments, they were actually in their before you anyway typing out their post.
---
Didn't Frank get like a little remodel too?
---
Graveyard shift has been in the game earlier and there was the least teaming of any modifiers by shooting each other you still losse health it does not gain any help or help you and while teaming you have to share damage to other brawlers so it isn't viable
---
I would save the Boxes to the next update
---
**Nice**
---
and it's better than the regular dragon knight jessie
---
And for duo the respawn timer is 15 seconds no brawler will survive thtat long in posion
---
But do you know where it came from?
---
ten minutes easy
---
They really dident if they did tell me when they said it
---
Tara fricked with gene. And now mortis. Wonder who's next?
---
Well how much wins u got on battlelands royale i got 700+ wins
---
These people are actually the shame in a subreddit
---
Saving this spot before it gets to hot
---
Well u didn‚Äôt really predict iT so...u only said that skin would be cool iT isnt really a prediction then
---
It is just with other name
---
Poco and piper did 69 then they made a child.
---
Nope
---
I smell some GREAT EFFORT...so have my spicy spooky upvote!
---
I saved up 11 big boxes and 115 normal boxes for the new brawler.
---
Then EMZ got announced. I opened up all my boxes, and didn't get any brawler missing (basically only legendaries).

Well I think it will be a 80 gem cost Skin, because i've dont see special effect or something. But i have 160 gems so 100% that i will buy it üòÑ
---
Tara + Gene = Sandy
---
And

Tara + Mortis = Skelly (or something I forgot her name)

Good, but i prefer Shark Leon. I dont like a egdy/evil style, for freacking kiddo with fidget spinners and hoodie

It looks like Gene
---
It can scare every barley/dyna/tick from miles away
---
Idk about this because I really like the color scheme of the default Leon, and the lollypop will probably be missing as well here

Isn't it against the terms of service?

Sandy was too tired to get into the picture

That new brawler is basically sandy, area attack ,area super, auto aim friendly, zero skill.
---
A bit boring.
---
Looool
---
Looks very good but somehow i associated it with Nita right away, seems like a skin for her
---
Awesome!
---
Yeee)
---
supercell sells battery alsoüòÇ
---
Oh yeah! (!
---
With emz if you play her for 15 to 30 minutes you get out of the area with only emz  and mostly play pther brawlers be happy that we get her for free about the emz design it can be that you don't like one of the designs there are 30 brawlers personally I don't really mind about the designs if they are detailed enough. Because the super is moving with her it can be interesting but we have to wait until she live.

Dani shaved because BS channel got 2 millions subs!

Electro magnetic ZOMBIE
---
its not that i've had my expectations to high, its just lame to me that it doesnt feel like they put a lot of effort into the event i do admit i was a bit to quick to judge the skins and that they are kinda nice.
---
overal i just dont like that its all the same soup just re heated
---
yup thats him. his voice gives it away.
---
incredible performance, yours truly
---
Thanks for all the support! Never had that much upvotes!
---
This video was nice. Thank you for that!

I hope you fix the connection issues!

Yea, bruh we need a report button

If you think this is cool, and it is, there is more of this stuff at r/dynamikegang

it's bs

exactly
---
Okay then have fun, go crazy! I have better things to do. Goodbye
---
You can play it on duos now and the brawlers look like ghosts (the ghosts may be part of the new environment and not life leech)
---
They will be really lost because they'll see their life decreasing...
---
Nah, It‚Äôs not child friendly like the other skins, which is something I‚Äôm bad at lmao. It did take 12 hours to make however
---
*TIME TO GET CONSTRUCTIVE*
---
Facts
---
You don't want a free new brawler?
---
Too good animation
---
LOL I AGREE
---
I cant change your mind. I just want it not to be 300 gems. Then I will buy it even if it will be 150 gems.
---
Oke
---
Lol true
---
But life leech was also playable on duos right?
---
On the brawl talk they have the thing where there is only the map and the caracter shown, somethink like ,,no hud"
---
That‚Äôs right I‚Äôve seen the whole match over and over again
---
Gee it‚Äôs swell to finally meet your other mates
---
That‚Äôs right I‚Äôve seen the whole match don‚Äôt really like how it ends
---
Gee it‚Äôs swell to finally meet you other mates
---
Who did you kill without me? who did you kill?
---
Did you grab gems without me? Which did you grab?
---
Did you play heist without me? Tell me if you played
---
Did you think all this time that I wouldn‚Äôt find out about you?
---
Rosa: he‚Äôs running circles around us
---
Dynamike: I‚Äôm rusty, gimme a break!
---
Piper: it really is him...but he can‚Äôt be serious!
---
Leon: you know her piper? Can you tell us who she is?
---
Who am I? Who am I!? What are you even saying?
---
I‚Äôm the loser of a game you obviously knew you were playing
---
Let‚Äôs play another game this time I get to win!
---
Lives on the line
---
Winner takes troph‚Äôs
---
Ready or not let‚Äôs begin

Yeah that‚Äôs right I‚Äôve seen the whole match over and over again

Life leech looks like a Halloween theme mode. Is it permanent
---
So youre THAT guy huh
---
yuri-tarded
---
But you rushed
---
sorry
---
Teaming will also stop at low trophies to when it pops up
---
Plz don't.... i get triggered when ppl call it the wrong terminology :(((
---
Oh god
---
hmmm gem grab rework?
---
But i'm sure you rushed a lot
---
as a 13k i can say that its more ez than u think
---
Why do we all end in 0.2
---
I'm just pussed off dude. Just waiting and waiting is pissing me off that's it nothing else.
---
And I know about light year but I just exaggerated and typed whatever I was thinking. Sorry for a silly title tho.
---
*inhales*
---
NICE
---
Undertale x Brawl Stars? Question mark?
---
Bibi as Frisk? 
---
Pam as Toriel?
---
I dont think her damage will be as consistent as sandy but i am not sure
---
It's literally so easy to get 8k trophies now, so idk why you're complaining
---
Im hoping not but I cant wait to get it
---
True
---
i think 20000 will be it, not 15k
---
Nope. Supercell cares about their players and theur longevity of their games MUCH MUCH higher than monetization.
---
Monetization follows good game.  Thats Supercell's philosophy right there. And believe me, Im right lol.
---
Theur newest game rush wars is very very frp friendly too! 
---
For more supercell info, visit my profile
---
Are all the brawlers in Graveyard Shift invisible?
---
You have to delete it now? becose we got life leach back
---
Well you know... having Leon is more than i could ever ask for
---
Tara as Undyne? Colt as Papyrus?
---
Oh gosh my sister is behind me too
---
New skin*conversational gone wrong*
---
Do you know what ‚Äúliterally‚Äù means? Because you‚Äôre not using it right. Sandy‚Äôs attack does immediate burst damage, Emz‚Äôs attack leaves behind poison like Barley and is better for area control. Sandy‚Äôs super stays in place and only grants invisibility without star powers, whereas Emz has her super always around her and it does completely different thing. Sandy can throw out his super then die but the sandstorm stays, whereas if Emz dies the super goes with her. There are plenty of differences, stop being so whiny and actually LOOK at the differences
---
Yeah It's seriously like a gacha game or something like I haven't got any mythic till now. And don't know how much I've to wait more
---
Pretty cool :)
---
*poisonous hair spray
---
I have even seen some exploits in duo life leech matches
---
Oh dammmmm
---
Frank as Asgore?
---
Fax
---
New skin confirmed
---
Since Halloween is NOT a global holiday, i think its  permanent mode named graveyard
---
Hat or no hat?
---
Shadow knight Jessie might be for star points

SETH AND DREW: electro wiz and MAX LV RG

frank, ryan, dani: FRANK MORTIS MORTIS
---
Man i hope its not like last time
---
I‚Äôm not whining, I was just stating why I don‚Äôt feel excited for this new brawler. I understand your point though, but I feel how I feel.
---
What tipe of pam skin
---
Well they didn't even talk about balance changes yet so don't be too angry about mortis not getting a buff because he might get one when the balance changes are announced.
---
Flair checks out
---
We need to speak more Russian
---
Well if you‚Äôre 8k+ trophies you can max her out.
---
I see this as an absolute win!*
---
Gosh that furry leon is hot
---
Carl as Alphys?
---
If he trows fangs on his basic attacks and howl and starting walking in four-legged in Super, the skin would worth 300 gems
---
fix ur grammar before commenting on people's views
---
I'm part of mortis gang but I'm kind of glad there's no mortis skin because mortis already has enough skins.
---
He had a bone to pick
---
The fuck?
---
Who's flowey then
---
Jessie as alphys
---
14800 baby
---
what? dont we all do that?
---
He have something black on it the original dont have it
---
Happy üéÇ day
---
We NEED more Brock skins
---
Electronic metal zombie
---
It says that the game will be under maintenance for a while
---
Darn it. I saw her mouth as a white mustache. Can't unsee that now...
---
Hm, okay ! &amp; yeah 3 turrets surrounding the safe works well tbh, damage turret, healing turret &amp; machine gun turret
---
I think this is her Star Power
---
One word
---
Nice
---
Upload to youtube :d
---
It seems like people dislike my idea... Would you mind explaining im open for criticism
---
Thank you!
---
Indeed haha. What Star Power did Jessie use?
---
I said how much trophies not when you got him
---
Why are you destroying afk plushies
---
Oops, my bad. I forgot to add an "s". Well, mistakes happen.
---
They actually showed us before telling us frank got a skin
---
I got 12000 today

How many dollar cost it? üòÖ

Jessie was using Shocky

I am dizzy from spinning,give me a break !

You‚Äôre one of the Morti that i don‚Äôt want to face
---
Spinel fits so much
---
Shadow knight is definitely 2500 there is no way it is 10k
---
They gave birth
---
What even happened here?
---
***Nah his peepee big***
---
But that died like months ago
---
People always al that same question :|
---
They never say when it is going to be realized, but you can have some possible answers, and this is in aaaall the Brawl Talks
---
In this case you may think that it is going to get realized on Monday, because the season ends :)
---
That husky is so cute!!!! üòç
---
*Wow that would be awesome*
---
beautiful
---
If it really is him, he can't be that fast
---
Me at 12k trophies and no legies
---
Thanks üî•
---
Good choice. I used to use Energize basically cause I didnt have the other one üòÖ. Both work well, but Shocky is super useful on the late match, when a handful of robots with 10k+ health rush to the safe
---
EMZ is the kid of Mortis and Bibi. LOL
---
Poco as sans...
---
I feel like it could be that when a brawler is killed by emz attack it leaves behind a cloud of *hair spray*
---
no
---
I still like Leon Shark dodododo
---
Well, it isn't out yet, so who knows
---
She still needs a remodel before she gets skins
---
You now that Kairos said that in his video at 13:20
---
üòÇ
---
When they release it. Probably around the same time the game goes into maintenance.
---
Yes, this post is soo stupid |:^|
---
r/unexpectedminecraft
---
I have every brawler except Leon...
---
It worked amazingly ! Took no damage until 6 minutes, all 3 just tried to tank for as long as possible haha !

It says: ‚Äöfight with a partner against other duo teams‚Äò . It‚Äôs German. You‚Äôre welcome ;)

Well Red Bull costs 80 gems, so Blue Bull is not that bad. Blue Wizard Barley is free though.

Why can you get two of the same brawler in a game but not start one? Every brawl tv game is two shellies in showdown

And the swamp creature (gene probably)?

Maybe yes, but idk.

Lol, whenever I just want the star tokens I will pick gene and pull the boss bot to the safe üòà

Too bad I don't have even a single epic card or higher at 4500 trophies
---
Nita has more skins than Leon
---
Is it joke?
---
i think the update is tomorrow (new power play mode every season)
---
Could that be one of EMZ's starpowers?! If it is that's a significant damage debuff!
---
Brock has already 4 skins, pam has none. There are priorities
---
Can‚Äôt say I haven‚Äôt been thereü§£
---
It will still heal but it will have to be in relation to how much health he‚Äôs losing. So if he‚Äôs losing 100 health per second, maybe the star heals 40.
---
i aint never buying a skin fir 150 gems, waste of gems tbh i always wait for sales
---
However, for people who are wondering, robo sight will not detect invisible brawlers, that means enemy leon and sandy will not be detected while their super is activated
---
Oh really? Well, this is good because the new anination looks better
---
I think that costume is brazilian, not mexican. But I could be wrong
---
Nice dude! :00
---
14200 lol
---
They got into brawl TV because they have 2 shelly, not EVERY show down have a team with same brawler right?
---
I saved 100+ boxes and this brawler being free is such a weird thing to me because i am tired of getting all these boxes hope for me to get mortis or tara at 12.9k trophies
---
Yeah true but I just feel werewolf would fit her much better.
---
I agree but don't at the same time since I have 12000 trophies. If they update it I won't get anything out of it and that would suck because if it's really good now i would've basically lost all those rewards
---
Oh shoot, that wasn't Jessie's hit, that was EMZ's super damaging the turret
---
Best comment
---
When you realize that we‚Äôre getting a free brawler to ready us for the 4th mythic
---
„Äå Z A    C R O W D O „ÄçTOKI WO TOMARE!
---
Love it!
---
Maybe you're right.
---
Would carl not fit perfectly with the executioner?
---
these are high effort skins....
---
EMZ is belongs to the horror trio.
---
It broke the old life leech too. And so does Crow with his poison
---
they probably ran out of time/too lazy to remodel the bear into a werewolf
---
You forgot, 3k megaboxüò•
---
Tkz, werewolf leon will probably cost 300, so it still has a place.
---
How many trophies you got. I have 12000 and I need Leon and sandy
---
If only it had attack modifiers
---

Yeah

Man ffs I bought the skin the first day it came out, now they are releasing a better version of it practically for free, I spend like 10$ on this ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èSupercell....

And then somebody spawns and kills you

Spike Super is better

Why is the guy with a poco flair smiling at this.
---
Reaction of my sister is that same
---
yo
---
The cool this about gene √Æs at the end of The replay, not when he scored.
---
Imagine if the shadow knight jessies turret would be a black dragon
---
i think it should be the other way around lol
---
I feel like this is a prediction. Leon takes an idea from Nita and Nita takes an idea from Leon skin wise.
---
Leon
---
Lol I used to camp with piper in life leech and did fantastic.
---
Basically, others brawlers keep moving looking for damage and you snipe them from a bush regaining a ton of health.
---
Makes zero sense considering Frank's main attack  is smashing the ground with his hammer. 10/10 art though.
---
***cries in frustration of not having a Legendary while having over 1,4000% of luck***
---
Well, I never said "official" details or "leaked"... You can clearly see the "probably" is shown from my point of view. Idk this discussion/your criteria is kind of useless in this point. But thanks for the information. Next time I'll make it better.
---
Saving is your best option, especially when a free brawler is comming soon and you could get power points for Her.
---
There is any way to get the DJ Frank song? I loved it!!!
---
Me too, others even three
---
lel
---
Attack range and coverage is similar, black portal damage etc etc
---
No it is the best skin
---
Maybe her skin is her mother and poco is piper brother
---
Wow bruh, u r mad! ONE MYTHIC ON 13K!

They sure like to dick with the game, but they never addressed the lagging issue from their servers

What is rule 34?

Dunno what ofc means, wasn‚Äôt trying to be mean. Just poking at the mortis and dyna joke
---
Good point, he walks just like nita
---
I think jesse might be more expensive, it's a recolor of a 150 gem skin my logic is 300 gem = 5k sp, 80 gem = 2500 sp, and just recolors = 500 sp, we havent seen a 150 hem skin recolor but my guess is that it might be anywhere from 3k-4k
---
I would love it to be 2500 tho I really want that skin
---
The door represents an Asian player in Brawl Stars. Asians are generally thought of as being best at things. Therefore, this meme is trying to say that you can't get a win because of this one Asian player that is always killing you in the game.
---
O yae we dont hafe a hole body shot so i didint make him
---
Can someone explain the joke to me?
---
PS: I know someone is going to answer woooosh
---
True thks
---
or, **"Delete him from life"**
---
Wow this is a shitty post
---
Her syper looks like sandys. That is where the similarities end. Her attack looks like sandys and has mechanics somewhat similar to barleys. Its definantly not 90% the same as sandys.

Its a hair spray but okay

oh yeah so good

I dont get it?

Cant believe I spent 150 gems on this skin just for a better one to come out for star points...
---
Its you who invnted the brock or the 8 bit
---
HOW
---
I am at 7600. I hope i get the mega box before the update

Me at 16.5k

When I talk about low trophy players I mean 0-4k

Not how this workss

I dunno sir but it looks like a mixture of both they

It appears you are not cultured lol

In this case no they shouldn't

Hmm, I understand now. The Brawl Stars team releases an update every month so it‚Äôs not like they can pump out huge stuff every month. I will admit, this isn‚Äôt their biggest update but it‚Äôs still got lots of content and it‚Äôs pretty nice to have an update with new content.

Me, at 16.8k trophies: Im sorry is this some sort of peasant joke I'm too rich to understand?
---
Those are some rookie numbers my friend
---
*(cries in beta)*
---
What are you thinking when stoling an art collab post... Drunk kid
---
I hope it is not an exclusive Skin
---
rererereeeepost
---
imagine being under 8k trophies, couldn't be me
---
Yes of course
---
–î–∞ –Ω—É –Ω–∞—Ñ–∏–≥?

We‚Äôre not crying over it, we‚Äôre just kinda salty
---
:O I love this
---
how does that make sense?
---
9 comments are posted by yourself
---
Oh...then I guess you kinda just gotta deal with it then
---
:) 4

---
9/10
---
I wanted a executioner skin for Carl but this is really nice
---
Shelly with super is the hell
---
obvious lies
---
Just ignoring them :)
---
F for all new players who never saw the old primo
---
S(hell)yüòÇ

So Frank's stand is [PHOENIX CROW]
---
Its new Crow skin
---
Amazing!!
---
Nice catch bro.
---
Also that will be REALLY good I think
---
Hahahahahhahahhahhahahhahahahahahhaahhahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahhahahahahahahahhahahahahahahaha! You make my day
---
Emz &gt; sandy
---
Taras head is wrapped in cloth Therefore she must be related to the dead, pop star, zombie because the zombie also has a little bit of cloth over her head. You guys have some interesting logic.
---
All healings are nerfed for the mode, so Pam, Poco, Barley etc. Are not OP
---
Cough Phoenix Crow
---
Sounds good! Thanks
---
Lol yes, the developer posted it on his Twitter and he claims it will be 4 times bigger than Gleeing the Complex. Ellie is a confirmed character in the game. Check him out!
---
Sorry but already in hodie homies
---
WHeN is nExt bRAwL talk?????
---
Whats whit that
---
I love my baby shark Leon
---
(Caught)...like the ROSA üåπüåµ
---
tbh
---
I miss this show
---
Out of 10
---
10/10 mate awsm
---
I don‚Äôt think so
---
I love it but his attack is like Ricos... Great art and Star Powers
---
A small price to pay for salvation
---
Dude, I have this crazy theory. Absolutely none of the brawlers have any relationship other than Pam and Jessie.
---
I'll take take it
---
They are theologist
---
Didnt see that
---
atleast the calavera piper is inspired by one of the skin ideas here
---
He might as well be stunned by frank
---
the zipper/chain kinda ruins it. its supposed to be a werwolf
---
üò±ü§Ø OMG! I totally missed that, thank you for mentioning that.
---
SHIZEN FIZEN HIZEN. NEIN
---
80-150 but everyone hopes for 80
---
What do you mean by theologist
---
Tbh, this would be better for Carl because like the executioner, their axes come back
---
Yo thanks man! Always loved these games. Hope Charles will be in there.
---
"This is the greatest plaaaaan"
---
what is free at 8000 trophies
---
Get it quick!
---
r/karmaroullette
---
Lol you have the same name as my
---
**crying in the corner with 60 gems**
---
But i haved this type of goal 3 times
---
Oh I see, but the Brock in the video reacted so slow, probably a bot
---
I actually just opened that mega box
---
Omg today i buyed m&amp;m and i was thinking of that lol! Thanks for reminding mwhen i was thinkinh about it
---
That would be nice! they have a love triangle lmao
---
why there is a big game logo at the top?
---
Wait I‚Äôm new to brawl stars... So 8-bit won‚Äôt be removed when the season ends?
---
I have 45
---
So, Mortis And Frank like Emz, but either she does not notice/care or she might not like any of them
---
Or this could be like a clip of someone else getting it xd
---
Theologist means they were studing a lot of Religion and go to an theology university and became theology gamers
---
And thats a fact
---
is this a real character? and i saw a post about a free character at 8000 trophies is this it
---
i sure hope not
---
Awwww man! Oh well, I guess I got to raise the roof somewhere else.
---
Before anyone asks, this isnt just a cropped image
---
Just pretend
---
*Laughs in 7k with all brawlers but leon and sandy*
---
No, it's not.
---
Hands down, Jessie and Leon now have the best skins in the game
---
Peace was never an option
---
Whoever says "Nice" js a 7yo comedy master
---
I think leon need a lion  skin and Nita need a wolf skin (his bear fits with wolf)
---
You now I have the shark leon skin and I love him I just wish that I have the werewolf skin he seems very cool
---
Tick might be really good In life leech
---
Or does it? Brawl Talk video involved a Mortis inflicting 1.8k-ish damage at Star Power with 5 cubes. Normally he would do 1764.
---
h
---
Happy brawl day üî´üî´üî´
---
Why did that bo suddenly attack shelly
---
Lmfao
---
I‚Äôm in a great clan that‚Äôs active with 900k-1m trophies. It‚Äôs all about finding a good clan that has unity and active.
---
Care to explain?
---
Shockwaves of wind. Also, how is that a halberd?
---
And your death in suffer and painful agony in her gas is such an OwO ü§ó
---
No she really is ugly, I only say the truth.
---
Tick was like fucking ww2
---
Thats a lot  of damage
---
His arms are too low to his body.....
---
Hat or No Hat
---
Lol hey Barom xP
---
This really reminds me of those xxxtentacion+sad edit videos
---
Gee its swell to finnaly beat her other mikes
---
Lyea
---
Bruh just play Nita
---
meanwhile me at 15k
---
It is the first 150 gem star skin, it will cost 5k
---
Yeah but you have to attack and showdown is not just about bush camping
---
What do you mean rude lol
---
What is Rush Wars again?
---
I mean... something IS clearly wrong... what are all these different brawlers in this strange place?
---
Shelly!
---
Thank god i got worried for a moment
---
I want to point this out that shadow knight Jesse has a faint scar on her right eye! I seen a few drawings of her without it but it such an amazing detail that supercell added!
---
Idk...it was wierd...i think it lost connection, but whatever, it saved me ;)
---
I'm adding this to my meme collection
---
Upvote means "yes"
---
Eu players will see them a lot like me
---
Bull-üí©
---
Do you join and just spam invites? Or do you join and say hi, talk to people, tell them your favorite game modes, see if anyone wants to team up? There‚Äôs nothing worse than someone who joins our club, spams people with invites, doesn‚Äôt say a word, and then leaves.
---
A tower defense game
---
Rip after reason reset
---
Teaming is baaaad boi, dont team :u
---
2500? You mean 5000 right? Dragon Knight Jessie is the first 150 gem skin recolour

Good Job this picture is my new whats app Profile picture
---
It didnt come out yet, but i think it can do more damage than sandy by main attack, about super it can do same damage if sandy has his first sp

[https://crux.page.link/4yyRh](https://crux.page.link/4yyRh)
---
It‚Äôs takedown
---
That would be really cool.
---
It‚Äôs not
---
Who knows
---
Well, atleast you get a new brawler (emz), she from what i've seen, she's pretty op too, so atleast you get the poor mans sandy
---
Emz is trophy road sadly
---
Looks perfect
---
Idk, you‚Äôre not wrong. They both cover the same area, and with Sandy‚Äôs star power, both deal tick damage around 200 (prior to Sandy‚Äôs nerf).
---
finnally a colt one
---
# yes
---
Yeah, rude sands got nerfed and now that star power should just say: ‚Äúenemies can‚Äôt heal in the sand.‚Äù Healing sands are still strong but he is reliant on that star power.
---
Kinda looksl ike a mix of Rosa and tara
---
Lol, i kinda agree......... and that showdown Modifier should be Boss.
---
Thought it was gonna be another gene skin
---
Kinda like an injustice 2 gear set idea. I like it
---
1. Emz super follows around her
---
Friendship ended with Shark Leon, now Werewolf Leon is my best friend
---
Oh I understand...I remember that the day the Retropolis trailer went out it was the same way I got my Crow to 650, it seems like a centurie has passed... I was with 7k I think. After 600 trophies, we used to gain only 5 in 1st place solo showdown :') (in 10th it was -8)
---
Don't you consider me a friend is more fitting in that situation if you ask me
---
But I have Shark Leon already so I‚Äôm mad conflicted
---
Only 5 for 1st?? Dang that‚Äôs crazy.
---
Not anymore they nerfed his area range
---
Good old days...now any nitwit can push, Just need to have free-time...
---
rise up buffy gang
---
I was just practicing with my Tick when I encountered that. If you didn't understand, when I aimed for the small bot, none of the mini bombs explored even though the bit was within the range.
---
No one gives a crap
---
I mean alot of people ready made alot of memes about this but in other templates
---
it's not a phase mom, this is who i really am
---
tbh he looks like he wants to get laid in that pic
---
Sucks to be you, I‚Äôm over here with 11k trophies üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
This is top notch stuff
---
Yeah...2nd used to gain 4, 3rd used to gain 3...
---
are slash funny reddit
---
He'll just have to eat *all* the hairspray then.
---
i don't think i will make it because i have it homework : (
---
This is an actual bug. The bombs don't hit only at certain angles.

---
It should be a Nita skin not leon
---
I know that. But i mean if they did this in this template
---
Yep but I just tried to copy the drawing somewhat
---
I have only leon
---
So I consider you lucky
---
REEEEE-post
---
Points for trying
---
He didn't do anything for tick and 8bit
---
Same
---
The joke here is that Frank dressed up like Frank.
---
.
---
What a bad joke
---
Thank you, I couldn‚Äôt find a clear answer anywhere
---
r/croppingishard and REEEEPOST
---
Aw, thanks dude!
---
or make a recolor of a skin you have for star points
---
u can check urself
---
I hope this skin is permanent
---
No, they're from my country, they're speaking the same language, these fuckers decided to troll ppl together, I feel ashamed
---
Ah yes my favorite chocolate *MEMZ*
---
Try it. Go outside and spray a bunch of hair sprays outside. Oh and invite your friends too. Make sure they bring alot of hair sprays too
---
It's a good reason. Then all we can do is hope they implement this on the game
---
12K without legendaries here :v
---
I don't play that much. Not more than 1-2 hours every 2 days
---
And put his beard on his head
---
Hureh-hurow!
---
Yes but her super does something completely different. I understand it has a similar radius but it for one follows her, and she doesnt throw it. Rico and colt have similar attacks but rico can bounce his. Emz has a similar radius but sandys doesnt linger. I see where youre coming from but i still believe that there are enough differences that shes not just a copy of sandy. You are however entitled to your opinion and i am to mine.
---
This is the most likes i‚Äôve ever see n on this subreddit That‚Äôs how you know everyone‚Äôs looking for the new piper skin

I didn't post that. And I think it meant the update that will come after the current one that's about to come. It's supposed to say that they remove all the megaboxes for trophybrawlers.
---
Don't forget about DJ Frank
---
Where did you find that image
---
i only need 74 trophies i know that i should have gotten it by now but i'm doing bad :  (
---
Pink/10
---
I know you can get 74 trophies bro :)  just do it
---
Awesome bro looks sick keep practicing you're getting good
---
Crap should not have used all my gems on shark Leon
---
Whean you open mega box you dont sure if you wiil won new brawler soo it wiil be okay
---
maybe they need to add another slot lol since we now have 3 modes rotate in the last 2 slots
---
That looks amazing! I love how dedicated people are to in the community.
---
Kairos time did this already but good job
---
10k trophies btw, should i save gems for sakura spike?
---
Letting em have it
---
I knew it
---
Like?
---
I definitely want one of these, they‚Äôre sick
---
This spike creeps me out
---
Good
---
That‚Äôs not that low though
---
Please cross post this to r/emzgang , we would love to have your artwork there!
---
yea but the problem here is i‚Äôm not active in brawl stars and i only play it at school eith my friends as i barely even play it at home, plus i dont grind trophies equally for every brawler like everyone do and instead i just grind to 500 individually for each brawler that i love the playstyle
---
Then why the hell is there a 1k trophies colt and a 950 dyna mixed up with 700s
---
If you look closely when they first introduce EMZ, a Penny lands a shot on another Penny. If you were to subtract the max health (4480) by how much she had left (3220) then you could see she lost 1260 health

Rule 34 artists: allow us to introduce ourselves

Why would you choose crow in life leech?
