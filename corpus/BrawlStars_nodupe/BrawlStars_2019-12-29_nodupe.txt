I have a small youtube channel but I onlybuse it to share these videos with my friends
---
Sometimes ignorance cannot be remedied.  then in catch you moan as I kill her if they are behind a wall with 10 gems which the characters in range cannot make and also load.  others recharge faster than bull or darryl, and adding the distance is impossible not to feed or pass it even if you want.  so please say stupidities go elsewhere.
---
Brawl team said they won't make third sp now, and that carl's third sp is on bs hacked mod
---
Me too, I thought the whole point of the map was to get hunted, run away, or rule the game; its even in the name, feast or famine
---

---
Depended a lot on luck
---
lol
---
Nioce
---
Nope
---
well thats fine I just wanted to say that i loved the video. also whats the channel i would subscribe to watch some ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
that does not break the fact that any brawler that this Serca of her is charged with shooting crazy
---
Awwww sweeetie
---
6 √ó 200 = 1200 = 12 boxes wdym
---
Use what?
---
Only 2 maps.
---
Now idk if my art is trash or not sooooo.....
---
Yup, that‚Äôs the new start. Got just over 7 with this comp and my buddies. Star powers help a lot too
---
Nope, I think only every other one tilts. It's pretty much an event modifier, I have no idea why they didn't put a little icon saying the tilt is on, like it does for modifiers in showdown
---
Alright I‚Äôll try to put things in order here
---
u/SomeDudeWhoDidStuff you shouldn‚Äôt try to justify someone‚Äôs point by just saying ‚Äúyou are not an expert‚Äù. Instead say what you already did in your next paragraph, that explains enough about what u/koochywalla did wrong
---
And about this one, saying ‚Äúthat‚Äôs bullshit because it doesn‚Äôt make sense‚Äù is not a point, not because is negative, but because is destructive. As the guy who did that post, I‚Äôd love to hear what makes you think that, so I can learn from my errors, but this just doesn‚Äôt help

Thanks for your support! The channel name is "HappySeal" but im not interested in subscribers. I just made it for fun. And many other videos I made are not that good
---
Well, please post this thing in r/BrawlstarsCompetitive ..
---
Most subs in that subreddit are higher rank and trophies than me.. I want to see what their opinion about this thing :)
---
That is my intention, I already had negative gems because supercel is dumb, so might as wel go more negative cause I will never buy anything again from braw stars
---
Wait, wot ?!?!?
---
Serious-f*ckin-ly ?
---
Sorry for you, my boy, and good luck...
---
How do you find this?
---
My highest was 6:49 with Pam, Jessie, 8-Bit
---
Sandy is too lazy to be sleepy.
---
But the meme starts saying it was Solo Showdown
---
About more than 10 minutes.
---
if people dont even know how to use their brawler they arent going to win a fight against someone who has the same brawler who knows how to use it, regardless of power level
---
That bot is

Do you have all epics? And how long have you been playing the game? This would help to see just how unlucky I am at the game, because I have been consistently playing the game from January to APril. Then, from August till now, yet I only have one epic brawler, currently at 9k.
---
It just me or you are blind
---
But when you get to a higher trophy count the margin of error is so small. If two people in a battle are both experienced players, say 400 trophies and up the person with the higher power level is 9/10 times going to win simply because they‚Äôre so much more powerful. Especially when it‚Äôs a power 5 vs a power 10. If it was say power 8 vs power 10, sure I could agree with you but this example isn‚Äôt unique. I have about 40 examples of the same type of egregious matchmaking
---
Well I mean I am pretty blind, I don‚Äôt have my glasses.
---
Wtf
---
I posted this on r/Brawlstars and it got more upvotes, Although, the only controversies here are Poco, Mortis and Frank. But instead of criticizing my SUGGESTIONS, please provide solutions to these three problems: Mortis only really works against noobs and bad team comps; Poco is incredibly dependent on his star powers, and even with the star powers, he needs tanks to be viable, but with the tanks he is OP. In other words, Poco is only good on two game modes with the the same comp; and Frank only works well on brawl ball (sometimes in siege) but requires a ton of support to be good, since attacking makes him incredibly vulnerable.
---
Got all mythics before my only epic brawler. I call myself unlucky though. Got all mythics back at April, and didnt get my first epic until a week ago.
---
Hey man what can you do, eh? ü§£
---
Not really, Leon can distance himself away from Darryl to avoid heavy damage. Plus his damage is more sporadic than Darryl.
---
Keep in mind Leon is a medium range brawler - not a melee.
---
We are all in agreement that SuperCell does this on purpose for brand recognition right?
---
I used to have them all, until Sandy came out üôÉ. I'm a F2P btw
---
Roll.
---
Go get ur glasses
---
.......
---
*whole and yea it‚Äôs been a year :(
---
The Main Action is near the end, but you could watch the whole thing.
---
There's Supers that can't deal damage at all, such as Leon's Smoke Bomb &amp; Rosa's Strong Stuff. Also, Gene's hand strikes only a single target.
---
Umm, if u r japanese, im pretty sure anime drawings sometimes have triangles. Boys and girls. So, a different person probs drew crow. And gene is literally a genie. Even if they r bots, they still have makeup. So he has a black triangle.
---
This is r/brawlstars. And by posting your suggestions here online you should be able to take criticism for them. All I'm saying is that these are not good suggestions.
---
I‚Äôm a simple man. I see original skin, I upvote.
---
Oooo you so lucky
---
Isn't brawl stars in finland not Japan, it was just a theory mostly, forgot to mention that
---
At close range is useless but makes him a good assasin
---
Both Leon and Darryl are good assassins but Darryl is better in 3v3 and Leon is better in Solo modes
---
[deleted]
---
Gene is the father of Sandy. So he‚Äôs male not female.
---
Ah that's why I can't succeed with leon because I can't do solo modes on my mini
---
Congrats! Nothing beats the excitement of getting a new star power! Except, well, a brawler. I've gotten hecka lucky this week, Christmas I got Snappy Sniping, Sandy, Bea, and Shocky, and today I got Berserker and Extra Toxic. I wish you more star power luck in the future!!!
---
Yo dude r/MinecraftCommands
---
I highly doubt yours is at 1.13%. Mine got to .35 at one point but took awhile to get there.
---
Maybe next time
---
Nice v√≠deo!
---
Watch the Shelly....
---
That‚Äôs what she said
---
Kinda like the witch from clash Royale? Cool idea, and can probably for into the theme
---
Bull and jessie need to be in the same tier as pam and 8 bit. And frank, primo rico and darryl need to be right below
---
Check my Meme which has 1.8k upvotes

When I'm in a public restroom and i hear it from the stall next to me...
---
Close, the guy I replied to said "oh you're approaching me" and I said "I cant beat the crap out of you without getting close" it's quotes from the anime Jojos Bizarre Adventure if you were wondering.
---
Where's leo...?
---
Oh....
---
ha ha lol. Clash royale seems louder
---
I counted and there were only 31
---
wat
---
Sorry I wrote "!are" by mistake . I !want "made"
---
Oh Thank you(T_T)
---
It‚Äôs not so much a glitch but rather an exploit since it wasn‚Äôt meant to be in the game but it isn‚Äôt due to the coding errors but instead by unintended means of messing with the game
---
I have seen this before, so I might have based my thing on yours.
---
My wifi likes to go bad when I start a match but start to work after I lose

It‚Äôs good and you are a amazing effect artist but white crow will never be a worth buy

The subreddit is just shit my dude, I could make a list of what‚Äôs wrong with it but I honestly don‚Äôt needa waste anymore time XD. Only reason I‚Äôm staying is for the good artists really, and the actual good memes.

Hm... I'm gonna think about that.

Oh, someone requested it. I just did that in their favor :)

I already did, you're late, and you sound like a pretty negative guy. What's been bothering you lately, huh? :)

My chances got to 0.3 then I pulled crow then Sandy back to back regular boxes, hang in their

CALM DOWN, SON

If you don't believe me that's okay.

Not neccessarly Brawl Stars only but ok

You could just get gUITAR SKELETon any day of the week. On the other hand, "BAD cACTUS BOY!!!" is a **legendary** and is **very** hard to get

So I am very confused on how you are angry.

I know it's too hard for you to think this is real.

My math class is basically a meme factory, so it's really fun actually

This happens if you spam play button after a friendly match
---
You both are lucky.

Cuz u got a babe

I‚Äôd much rather have rosa than crow. Rosa is significantly better.
---
Lol i was looking in new and was just kinda confused, i gave you four upvotes anyway
---
Very nice art
---
Well, I'm not lazy and I am not saying this is art with a lot of effort put in it. I was doing it just for fun while waiting for a stylus that I ordered.
---
Nah I think asian dad sneezing is louder lol
---
Well You can paste but you need to colour it
---
Thank you!!
---
You deleted the post so you clearly did, see ya honey :)
---
The offical brawl stars artist
---
Well it is. They add another digit to the player tags to compensate for more players as each player tag must be unique. If you have less digits for your player tag, then you‚Äôre one of the earlier players.
---
Moreover, check out all the old players. The Brawl stars youtuber Lex also has 6 digits and he has been playing around the the beginning of beta. 
---
I‚Äôve been playing since week 1 of the beta and also have a 6 digit player tag, so I would say that‚Äôs how to determine an OG.
---
Actually max isn't that bad. She's good at distracting the bug robot
---
[removed]
---
Yup
---
Decent post, well done
---
I think the others only know the name?
---
The pictures are made by supercell. The person who put them all onto the grey background is irrelevant
---
Nobody knows.
---
lol you can make it in time, keep pushing.
---
And that's a fact.
---
Yes the meme might be dead but can we appreciate his effort on how much big boxes and small boxes he has? This work can take more than 2 months...
---
WHY HAVE YOU DONE THIS TO MEEEEEEEEEEE( no offense)

Thanks dude if u want to see my old one it's better than this I think u can go to my profile and see it

Thanks!

Be careful with this jokes
---
I'm at 13 k I'm not talking about going to 650 trophies with level 5 brawlers I'd never kill anyone and I would probably lose any 1 v 1 in solo show down I'm talking about taking for example a power 7 brock to 500 and stopping maybe 550 for power points
---
I'm 17 yo virgin so call me 14 yo maggot
---
While this would be awsome to have i feel like supercell has other things they need to work on which pushes this idea back but still I would love this
---
This is adowable
---
*laughs in screeching solo ready*
---
I want sandy too but im got max T&lt;T
---
My friend did not get a brawler for 2 months but got all mythics in one week. Your golden time will come
---
Overused meme
---
There's a solution of this problem ‚òùÔ∏è
---
Play Darryl too &gt;:-)
---
Beat enemies with their weapon
---
I feel like that's the joke
---
I didn't even had an epic brawler until i was 9k, but now i have 31 brawlers.
---
Thank you, I really apriciate the support
---
Overall based on how much I like playing them / how useful I find them:
---
* S: Bibi, Gene, Carl
---
* A: 8-Bit, Tick, Emz
---
* B: Bea, Sandy, Rosa
---
* C: Max
---
There's none I outright dislike, but Rosa isn't much fun to play (despite being one of the best brawlers, that's different) and Max is a lot of fun but in practice quite underwhelming. On the other hand, Bibi instantly became one of my top 5 favourite brawlers in the game, and Gene, Carl and 8-Bit are up there in my top 10 too.
---
Ok russian
---
No camping on my watch
---
This is such a cool brawler idea :)
---
Good luck getting it. My luck was so bad.. it took over 2 months go get my first star power after getting one to level 9.
---
If you do get impatient... never buy star powers in the shops.

Thanks. Hope you have better luck from now on!

I use this thing with nita with bear with me star power...... I take the damage until it becomes low enough then my bear tanks, during time i attack the bot so regains a few health..... After getting enough myself, i starts tanking for the bear.

Nice, you are an expert!

I have a couple of questions:

Is he good at picking kills? (I love assassins)
---
In which modes is he viable?
---
How should i play him in order to get kills and exploit his ability of supporting/control (poison)?
---
No
---
Are you a *T H O T*

Probably a fake one

Nice! Remember when mortis used to dash as far as coiled snake dashes now but that was his regular dash. He was so op and it took then a while to figure out what to do with him haha

Great, now I‚Äôll never unsee it..
---
i had 0.510%, then i got Sandy
---
Sorry mortis is my fav
---
Lmfao this aint a glitch and everyone knows about this
---
It needs yellow
---
Damn, me  is kinda dumb ( I thought I counted all of his skins bo's skins, jessie, ect skins)
---
Desperate for internet points? Lmao
---
The big problem with Leon is op in solo modes, but in 3v3 is on the weak side. This is why I believe that is pretty hard to buff him, because he will be unstoppable in solo modes.
---
In the other hand Mortis could receive a buff, he is in the weak side of the meta right now. 
---
And I believe that Dyna and frank should also deserve buffs
---
wow, pretty good.  How many rank 25/30/35 brawlers do u have?
---
Dont be dynamike,be tara.

mega box offers are situational and they can be really good. i recently bought 4 mega boxes for 130 gems or so

It‚Äôs a very rare chance that this happens. He must‚Äôve done very good while everyone else was bad or mediocre. But it indeed is no bug.

He is hiding behind the  bull
---
I hate those
---
Hi
---
We need a report button
---
Yes, sandy can hide is allies but, that's if he has any and leon makes it up with having: more damage, higher movement speed, faster charging super and a more discrete super. But yea, i think the main problem of balancing leon is that he is great at solo modes but, sucks at 3 v 3 modes. So i guess we both have a point.
---
...
---
Congrats! I got Bea yesterday.

Leon realizes it's a replay

Robo-bandits should get their remodels too.

Damn thanks

I was being sarcastic.....

THEN AFTER YOU UNLOCK TWO LEGENDARIES FROM THE BRAWL BOX YOU GOT
---
It's fake, the same thing happened to me on my mortis when I clicked tabs and then went back on brawl stars.
---
I wouldn't pay 10 gems for a big box.
---
Yea it's not that hard to find just go to the info of a box, I get star powers very quickly usually a day within getting to level 9

Dude wtf 2.0

Ok,thanks.I will try it tomorrow,since now I  don't have enough battery (I write this from my mom's phone)

**Breaking News: Brawl Stars banned in China**

good one... no one tile gaps, not that open, good amount of cover, perfectly balanced, just remove the water in the mid maybe and replace it with walls
---
I don't understand

What this means ?

This is bad

You should just tell them.

Yeah thats what I am saying. It's  good for people to spread information for things that arent known that much.

i think they are making a new and faster way to get all brawlers (if you watched "Brawl stars: behind the scenes")

Why health?

Because if they remove power cubes the matches will take so long to end
---
I got 6:29 and 6:30 with the following (all brawlers maxed)
---
Pam, Jessie and 8-Bit
---
Bull, Jessie and 8-Bit
---
Thx
---
Agreed, its so hard to get brawlers
---
If you're carefull you can, also, some brawlers can do that easily, Tick, Barley, Dynamike, Rico
---
You can still check them with every brawler except like Mortis, but honestly, Even if there is somebody there, you can bait them to go out of The Bush by simply trying to go into a Bush and when you get close, just quickly run back, or maybe some People just suck idk
---
Congratulations!
---
Gene: yes but actually no
---
Sounds like a fake post to get karma but if this is real I hope ur feeling better
---
 Yay someone finally of knows Edit did it! I hope they add because, come on I no think is so hard (and maybe they should add for the Halloween maps the graveyard shift modified)

Actually a nice map

---
I bough a big box for 30 gems today and got max and rosa's star power
---
why would you d o that
---
Still like it tho!
---
 
---
From germany!
---
I think it should be the normal trophy gain.
---
The line are not straight but this is pretty good
---
Then the brawl gods are improving our robo rumbo  strategy
---
I will try to fix it.
---
That doesn't mean I am instantly wrong
---
 Also you have been downvoting my posts, why is that? They contribute.
---
Am i the only one who doesn't get it? Damn

So 50000 for a mew legendary brawler since with 50000 i can buy a gold mecha skin?
---
Take my upvote and leave
---
Ah-ah. Crow. He'll expose you from a distance, and you'll be screwed
---
Yep üò∂
---
Coincidense? I think not!
---
Cool
---
When you use him you do no damage and never get a kill, but when someone else uses him they get you right before you heal
---
Yeah I was thinking it might be a bit more challenging to play these matches which is why the trophies are boosted a bit. But yeah I could see it as regular trophy gain too.
---
Oh yes üåö
---
Why are his/her legs so small?
---
This is more important than mario bushes and clouds situation
---
What wonderful news, congratulations and Gjob staying strong!
---
What‚Äôs your account tag?
---
lol what a funny coincidence!
---
Cavern storm
---
The problem is that I'm trying to gain 750 on Crow for month (sorry if you don't have a legendary) and often when there are a bush and close to it a wall or acid cloud. There isn't enough place to check.
---
It literally does mean you are wrong... normally they teach you to follow the rules in grade 1. You in grade 2 yet buddy?
---
Not if a Rosa comes out of the bushes at Mach 10 and kills him in 0.2 seconds (that's what happens to me)
---
me : sakura do you wanna play?
---
sakura : yes !!
---
me : ok come to the bed you will see it's a game that gives you a lot of pleasure ;)
---
sakura : ummmm ... ok let's have fun
---
What part
---
I hate Shelly ( super is OP)
---
Been playing since beta launch so technically that‚Äôs a small amount
---
Thats more like an antimeme. Where you use the meme template and the caption to regularize the meme too much is the general thing

hmmmmm

Quite the opposite my friendüò¨

I meant his first blaster is missing
---
Maybe support is the wrong word, i mean controller. Anyway, i think the same: crow is good at killing enemies but a lot of people say that at high trophies he becomes just e support/control
---
Nvm
---
yes more
---
while grinding 400 a day maybe
---
THIS IS MY POST! I WAS FIRST!
---
Pretty cool, and it could be designed like the executioner from clash royal

Aight lol

their names are in persian language (it's similar to arabic) i'm from iran so i know about it :)
---
Thanks for using my meme!
---
^still ^dumb ^though
---
But star powers....
---
He's right, y'know?
---
but once got 1k a day when the trophies were normal
---
Yes, thx
---
yes template I'll share it. My YouTube soon.
---
what animation is this mortis from?
---
nice creativity!
---
I put my tag as it was written on my profile, I don't know why it doesn't work for you
---
u make me laugh as hell
---
I wouldn‚Äôt class him as support, I consider him as an assassin. He can push enemies back by stopping them healing , but really he‚Äôs still an assassin. He does have some control in that sense tho.
---
I'll share how to making and design on YouTube.
---
You should have made the mortis darker shade. MY EYES

right supercell  got to try

r/emojipolice
---
iS tHaT a JojO reFeNCe
---
And is apart from pushing enemies back, does he kill a lot of them? 
---
This because i m looking for my main brawler and i realized that what i like most in this game (as like as other games) is being the one that kills a lot of  enemies and they are usually a glass cannon. Does crow fits my playstyle in your opinion?

Wait a minute this isn't r/teenagers!! Beating cancer is a teenager subreddit thing

Bo with the first star in this map is opü¶Ö

This map is not cool, bht better all of new Showdown maps
---
If I wasn't so power cube greedy that might work
---
Yeah, if you use him right. Chip them down at a range with your poison then you can jump in on them. He sounds like he‚Äôd fit your glass cannon play style.

Bro there is no problem on creating *almost* the same meme with a different template. And your meme got 2.7k upvotes IN THE BRAWL STARS subreddit. That's pretty rare you know. Stop being envious and let him have his credit for the meme he did

Almost 13k

Good boi üëåüëåüëå

Emoji good, anti emoji team bad

There is a friend of mine who got crow in a big box he bought for 30 gems.
---
I never talked to him again
---
No. You can get it in about 50 boxes, why are you wasting gems?
---
And:
---
\- Ticketed event
---
\- Present Plunder
---
\- Graveyard shift (I know it was removed, but why not leave it for friendly games if you still wanna play that with friends?)
---
Crow: removes the use of bushes/invisiblity for 4 seconds after every attack, decreases attack damage by 20% for 4 seconds after attacking, fastest normal move speed, almost 9 tile range in attack
---
Sandy: spawns a bush over large area for 8 seconds that can heal freinds or damage enemies, tank speed, bit more range than frank
---
I don't follow
---
this makes tick look like a sweetest thing in the world and not a annoying peice of garbage
---
Removed - DO NOT SUBMIT POSTS WITH TITLES IN ALL CAPS. CAPS LOCK IS CRUISE CONTROL FOR COOL
---
Is it just me, or has the amount of bad fandoms skyrocketed since the update? Laggy teammates, AFK teammates, bad bots, game throwers, people that have 500+ trophies on a brawler and *cant fucking use their super*
---
Argh
---
???? he is saying that if u buy a skin that cost 50000 star points like golden mecha bo, the background of the unlocking animation will be yellow like unlocking a legendary brawler
---
Somebody should make this meme but have fire in the bottom
---
that's baby food

Because bot cant function very well in this mode
---
Like a meteor targeting them and they'll just stand there

So I think thats why Supercell didnt add event modify YET
---
But it's just a skin, wanna know what's sad, the fact that I don't have star shelly and have 2x the trophies of someone who does and he has mortis while I dont
---
Yeah, there's no point in making it higher
---
Yeah, they look ugly af

beat me to it

Maybe draw tara's shadow next to her healing her

Congrats!! ü•≥üéâ

Maybe it's for higher contrast. It may be hard for some people to see the bushes in the map "preview". (I don't know what to call it.) Personally, it's hard for me sometimes to see low-contrast details in games and images. That's just my take though. But it could cause a problem seeing as in game, yellow bushes are different in mechanics than green bushes.
