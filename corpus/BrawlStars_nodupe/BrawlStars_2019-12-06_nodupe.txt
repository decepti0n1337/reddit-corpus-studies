I remember when I used to play the game. It was tap to shoot/aim. Then they changed the controls and now I do not play :(

If you want to prove that you did show proof: some picture of the draft or its signature, because the one in the drawing was clearly placed over it.

That‚Äôs- that‚Äôs not how it works.

Thank you

What do you mean? That's exacly how it works.
---
If you meant that's not how matchmaking works, he WAS in a gameroom with the nita and matchmaking is based on the highest tropy player in the room, probably cause else it would be too boring, at 500-700 people start to get decent.
---
Well it could also be that the nita plays the game and told his friend he should download it and then they played together in a gameroom, then the colt really played for the first time and the nita and barley had to carry, but i think if the colt really played for the first time, they would've lost
---
I am a brazilian too! Quer ver?
---
Correction: He HAD TO BE playing with the nita
---
Else he would get bots as enemies for the first few games and then players on around his trophy lvl
---
Good for them, some people unlock them at 2000 some at 14k. Complaining about it doesn't change anything
---
Yeah and he payed for them lol
---
Best drawing I have ever seen in this sub reddit

r/iamveryrandom
---
Colt no! Look what they have done to my baby boy!
---
camping is compensating for short range brawlers
---
Also, people like that could play with similar people in that aspect. It's already like that. The range in power points seperate plenty of folks. It's almost worked out it's own ladder system in that regard.
---
You could still team up with club members if it were say BB, or duo's. So you wouldn't HAVE to play with random folks
---
that, and the contrast between the first one and the new one
---
Thanks friend, I also ended up finding the image two minutes ago after an internet search. Let's report this guy, nobody deserves to be highlighted for a job that is not yours.
---
This....... This is just dark
---
Lmao the primo
---
It's part of the game, if everyone cooperates, and focus on the boss, soon, everyone will be using colt or any other mid range high dps brawler. 
---
At that point, the game would be decided on your character(your dps), and luck. 
---
Personally, I rather not play takedown in that fashion as it loses its appeal to me.
---
Oh boo hoo! Le me press F on the world's smallest keyboard.

Idk but what about Luigi ghost Pam?
---
To clear up any suspicion, I am OP's best friend in real life.
---
He went to a PreK and made friends with a little boy with down syndrome that likes brawl stars. The drawing is real, and a boy with down syndrome is present. My friend lied about the boy being his little brother, as he is the youngest sibling. I guess he didn't know how to put it so he just called him his brother.

Garbage

Ah no worries!

I thought I was the only one. This bug just started happening to me a few hours earlier. Once I open the app, after the loading page, the screen shrinks to about 75% as you've mentioned, but the touch controls are in the same spots. Even if I close the game, my entire phone is in that state and goes back to normal when restarted, with the struggle of blindly finding that restart spot in the screen. Sigh.

You should get FlipaClip plus, it‚Äôs worth it. Awesome animation btw

14 year olds: "THIS IS SO DEEP"

How old is this
---
Ok ughoomer
---
Depends on how many brawlers u have for powerplay i guess, but i would rather upgrade nita
---
Exactly. When the shield is down on the boss, you go for it ALWAYS, its just the strategy that will give you consistent success in this game mode, 
---
By killing that colt he missed out big time and judging by the amount of cubes he had he must have been between 5th and 10th place, one of his supers could have put him from losing trophies to gaining trophies but instead he decided to kill someone else

You're right he needs a buff it's not fair
---
*you're

Yes. But in game you will see that emz is the height of Frank and mortis. 2 Grown men. So she is definitely not younger than 15
---
I have seen girls at 12 as tall as grown men
---
I love it, you don‚Äôt see it too often and it‚Äôs a really beautiful skin. The effects when he flies are pretty great!
---
You mean –ó–≤—ë–∑–¥–Ω–∞—è —Å–∏–ª–∞?
---
I don't even get power points anymore, so if I don't get a new brawlers it's the most disappointing box you've ever opened, besides the chunk load of coins I get
---
You mean ,,–ó–≤—ë–∑–¥–Ω–∞—è —Å–∏–ª–∞"!
---
Probably just acid rain clouds, that'd make perfect sense
---
ok

Yes I am
---
At least give some credit

Eh
---
I actually pushed my Mortis to 600 in brawl ball and I only lost 2 times. He has a really high skill cap. And I practiced Mortis in brawl ball for 10 months.
---
Click on your name, press change flair
---
I was thinking like a monster a
---
Slime with a axe called TOD he is a tank(I know it's my name-_-) 
---
Rarity:leggendary
---
Health :5400 (lvl10) 
---
Main attack crazy axe: he slash three times like a combo the first two are normal slashes like Bibi the third one is a circle spin 
---
Max damage (lvl 10) : 1¬∞and 2¬∞ 540 last spin 1000
---
Super berserker : he throws the axe in one direction dealing 1000
---
(7 tiles) trasforming in to a bigger monster adding 7000 max health slamming fists like  Nita's bear 3 times that deal 1000 each
---
When he is in that form he can't be healed after he's health goes to 0 the super runs up and ends  turning Normal he won't die but he is super tired so he's dmg is reduced for 5 sec 
---
Passive:TOD  has a strong super but to charge it you need to take damage and after berserk u need to wait 10 sec to use it again
---
STAR power:
---
Light axe : every time you attack you attack 20% faster than the first attack
---
JuggerTOD (juggernaut+TOD) :when TOD trasform in berserk mode
---
He is immune to stun ad knockback for all the duration
---
And that's my idea
---
that acid smoke that melt metal
---
A few months ago i was Mortis in solo SD and A random barley came out the bushes and walked towards me. I attacked him until he had 50 HP and then let him run. But he stayed. He gave all powercubes to me and followed me like an bot. (Sorry about my bad english)
---
That‚Äôs not how Brawl Stars works. 
---
For example you would have a matchup of Tick vs Rosa and it‚Äôs completely one sided.
---
U/idkVeronica posted a sad video and this is from that video

this is good perfect
---
**smashes spatula into the grill**
---
He is just pure tank, and I like the move speed change,(will implement that), but he does have a crazy 2secs of delay to his main attack, meaning that with his short range, you will have to chase the brawler with you health and corner them, not an easy task,just to be able to hit them. That why the damage is so high, as for his super it is meant to be devastating for the recipient and their teammates need to try and interfere. So in conclusion, his high health and damage are balanced by how vulnerable he is while attacking. Thank for the feedback.
---
there is a mistake in the blue goal its should be litle back
---
Yea h but he is even worse.
---
Let's downvote him till he gets negative karma.

Same problem. Started last night. If it happens to you go to your display settings and zoom back out to get everything back to normal. It wont fix the game though.

I would buy this if it became a skin

Seven was the in-between. I have no idea why it was nerfed. Leon without a star power is *strong* in lone star, but not *too* strong. They should have just nerfed Smoke Trails and left it at that, or maybe still have buffed Invisiheal since nobody had bothered to try it when it was at 800 and they had no way to know 1k would be OP.

Think about it. Why should casual players watch pro players? They simply do not care. SC wants to make money. They make money off beginners and intermediate players so they focus on them only. Once you max your account SC doesn‚Äôt give a damn about you anymore. This game will forever be a game that caters to beginners and new players. Pro players are like a sideshow they aren‚Äôt respected at all. Casual players do not care at all about watching them. And if you think about it, why should they? Why not spend the time playing the game yourself instead of watching other people play? SC treats top players and pro players like garbage they do not care about them at all. As a Beta player with a maxed account, seeing my trophies reset every 2 weeks and basically just running around in circles now with nothing to play for. This game doesn‚Äôt care about me or anyone with a maxed account or high trophies. We should all go on strike and quit this game. If SC won‚Äôt promote us, then let‚Äôs just quit and do something else. Let this game go full barren noob wasteland if it isn‚Äôt already that

When you use the trademarked "[Name] is my name, [Profession] is my game" phrase, breaking Carl's NAP and thereby allowing him to teamkill you.
---
Can you explain it in the comment of some other posts. Like go in your post in subreddit art and tell me

Easily with Crow

8bits all juiced up. Nice idea haha
---
Yeah i wish i literally barely got piper in a year
---
No not again i had a lol session the last time üò§
---
No, I know your right, but come on, the meta doesn't really correlate with regular gameplay with randoms. Also, Crow has the best bounty game ever.
---
He does heals 1800 hp when he kills someone. But just when he kills someone tho. Its not easy at all just to reach enemies without dying, and its even more difficult to kill them after reaching them. He really is the """fastest""" brawler, but dashing around the map would just make you waste ammos that you could use to attack the enemy. So using ammos to dodge, get close to the enemies or even to self pass the ball is a really bad practice imo, unless your other two teammates deals enough damage that compensate yours. So he is actually as fast as other assassins. His super is actually good, the only good thing about him along with the speed (because lets face it, he has pretty mediocre hp and dps for a close range brawler). His super can make him do some pretty nice team wipes, but at high levels players arent stupid and dont stack up togheter, so bye bye team wipe. And i think i forgot about the usual brag about him having the slowest reload speed and the shortest range out of all brawlers. Also he is the only brawler that cant attack through water, cant take out ticks head without taking damage (same thing with Bruce and Scrappy) and he is completely useless against shelly and i would say rosa. These thing may seem not so important but in fact they are. These players managed to get him to rank 35 because they had really good teammates, and they didnt have an actual life as well. But if you play with randoms at high levels (like i do) he is pretty shit.
---
Then why you get the offer
---
finally someone who agrees with me that jessie is op, penny too. nita too. basically the 3 damage spawners.
---
Ok man, just don't come crying to me when you have 7 stars in bounty and don't have a super to utterly decimate anyone who tries to take them.
---
Piper be like YEEEETTTTTTTTT BOIII
---
So gorgeous! Really liked the way you drew her dress! :'0
---
Hahahah
---
I had seen this supposed skin some time ago, but in more current datamines it was not mentioned

Photo bombing lol

Guess what? Not everyone is maxed and not everybody plays at the same place.  You can go quit because you are being toxic to the community anyways.  New game modes are supposed to make it interesting for the maxed players.
---
U just a noob lol. Get rekt normei
---
Great skin.
---
Didn‚Äôt laugh

Connect to supercell you will get wizard barley
---
Ur late with finding this
---
Great idea and maybe you should be able to switch brawlers as well.
---
Skillzzz
---
Thanks! He‚Äôs my first rank 25.
---
I like the skin of her cannon but i dont really like her model design
---
This is so fucking true
---
Yeah, I got it. You could get it on global release of BS.
---
Very good painting!
---
I would say, "don't play the game if you're mentally retarded", i mean even if the mentally retarded teammate doesn't pick up the gems, it's still a lose cause you have to play 2v3, and most of the retarded teammates just run straight to the enemies, get shot and charge the enemy supers befor they die and 3 brawlers with super against 2 brawlers will always win

Smart 100

Look at his game tag in his profile and send him a friend request

No, I don‚Äôt think that they are limited. They‚Äôll be in the shop and randomly appear like normal skins do.
---
I am in pure awe
---
You did well, but why did you decide to draw Piper? I like this drawing, hope there are more coming!
---
Star powers aren't worth buying anyway
---
Ikr
---
Thx!
---
So the gold 25th day just gives you only 7 tickets?? Lol
---
He still need a nerf
---
bruh he literally made it in the same time
---
Also why do you use √Æ instead of i. Its not that hard
---
Report him! Tell everyone to report him! Is mad unacceptable and racist
---
Neat handwriting but his legs look a little off.
---
What explain
---
what makes you think that he deserves them? Not being negative at all,  just curious.
---
FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
---
FFFF
---
I wanted the tickets to repeat and not give much since supercell still wants to earn money meanwhile this event is going
---
Another jessie skin?

I'd love to see baby yoda follow everywhere I go and stay near me. But I would be sad because if I die baby yoda dies.
---
Unpopular opinion but He's shit in sd and lone star aswell, there are better options to choose from for those game modes.
---
Let him have a permanent banned!!!
---
How much for 1 of them
---
Well that was a freaking lie
---
Yes
---
Dont get me wrong, jessie is a great utility brawler, and her turret is amazing cc, with the health buff it makes using first star power really viable, but... she's not really that strong even with the projectile speed buff

Oh god,oh fuck,the brawlstarscactus is here!!
---
The best ideas (4 ideas) 
---
1.Takedown rework
---
Now is ticket event and instead of dealing damage to the boss the boss will be just like in boss fight insane 3 (you can bet tickets) you and other players (10 players vs boss) (the same rules as boss fight but maps big as showdown maps)
---
You can play it in friendly game
---
2.you can play other ticket events in friendly game
---
3.star token doubler(ammount 18)price 40 (when is not on discount) 29 when in discount
---
4.star token doubler even it will double every star token no matter the event it will rotate for every mounth with the double token event
---
Lol stop upvoting this, I'm just reporting this thief
---
Highly unlikely. If you were maxed out on power points, you would not receive this offer due to the game giving you offers based on what you need.
---
Okay, thank you very much
---
I promise you it happen a few times
---
But then it becomes a hybrid between poco, emz and piper
---
ive done that like twice before
---
Piper should be wise, she literally a princess from a rich family maybe
---
feel better yet rookie
---
Oof
---

Sorry but, aren‚Äôt good ideas

The thing is this guy's editing is one of the best in the brawl stars funny moments thing. But i agree that click bait for funny moments are ridiculous. Btw thie guy is mobile arcade

But dynamites will barricade themselves and the game won‚Äôt end
