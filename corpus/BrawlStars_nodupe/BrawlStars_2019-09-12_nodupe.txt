Who remembers when gem grab had healing mushrooms
---
I dont know how to tell this but here it goes.it is for a compilation of stories best made into videos. I think the title should be 'Brawl Story'

Episode 1
---
A young botanist geek girl named Rosa decide to do experiment on how to revive dead plants. She test it on a plant. She did some experiment on plant and on doing so an eplosion is set off. Alarmed by this a person working on cemetary dacide to check it. Upon seeing what she was into, he(Mortis) decided to help her on condition that she bring dead people back. She agrees and continues her experiment while mortis starts to gather bodies. But on her experiment she forgets to create separate potions for plant and human. she is then invited by mortis in his lab inside cemetary. She walks inside and see a dead body on a table torn to pieces and stitched. She decide to give her potion a test and sprinkle the body with potion. On the side of body there is a potted plant of cacti and a crow trying to eat flesh of body. As her potion was spreading wind blows and the cacti came in contact with potion. The body(frank) comes to life. Both are happy that it is success. They both cheers like maniac. But then in the peripheral vision of rosa something is seen moving. She is alrmed and on closer inspection she notice that the cacti has moved from original place and out of its pot. The cacti has come to life. And a strange humanoid silhuato is seen in the background. The humanoid figure looks like hybride between human and crow. Rosa is happy and tells mortis that her potion will never be reveled to the world.she hers strange noise coming out of window. End of episode one.

Episode 2
---
A  man is working alone in his bar late at night when he faint noise of a girl screamin. So he grabs his stotgun and head that way. When he comes near the cematory he realise the sound coming from inside the cematory. He sneaks into the cematory and see the light coming from a room. He quietly checks the room to discover that a dead body a cacti and a crow has been brought to life. While there he hears the girl telling she will never reveal the potion to world. He then hatches the plan to steal the potion to bring a robot to life to help him in the bar. Then rosa notices him and he runs away. He then goes back to his bar to find a two spanish guys stanging outside his bar. One is a wrestler who dont speak english and guy with a sombaro playing music on jis guitar. The guitarist is regular in the bar and is well known by name Poko. He tells bar owner(bull) that wresler is El Primo(male cousine). But he think it is his name. Bull decide to hire Primo to beat up rosa to steal her potion. But since he has no one to bring back to life he sends his wife a note saying he need something to bring back to life and if she could arrange something for him. His wife(Pam) lives near a junkyard used mostly by a robotic experiment lab
---
 She sends him a robot which was delivered by a late teenager son named colt. Bull Poko and Primo raid the mortis lab and steal a large bottle of potion. Rosa is seen fleeing into jungle with her potion that was left by bull by mistake. Episode ends.

„Öã„Öã„Öã„Öã(it means hahaha)

That doesn‚Äôt matter, what matters is that the person got a leggy on their birthday
---
I‚Äôm sorry but this is so hard to watch I‚Äôm cringing so much
---
Happy birthday
---
Robo spike is in the restroom
---
My guy; Shark Leon, all Mecha Skins, Pink Piper. All of them (and some more that I can't remember right now) were inspired by the community. They are not going to add all of the community skins because they are programming a game, not just drawing them.
---
F
---
No this is an = sign and what you will see after it is your iq 
---
Sorry had to do it nah it‚Äôs just a dress design you can find it in real life sometimes
---
 That‚Äôs really cool did you make it?
---
U just had to play one more game
---
The best of feelings
---
Are those Tara‚Äôs cards?
---
Bruh how is Leon not fun to play with he can scare people so bad and he‚Äôs fast how could you not like him
---
They also play against the best players, so it‚Äôs fine
---
Wow
---
Jojo stand looking az
---
STONKS
---
This is not ok
---
Just kidding dude...
---
Nothing wrong with that, we are all friends here right? (I don‚Äôt team and want peace between our kinds)
---
I like that, but I think the supercell never see my post and your comment
---
Yea if they‚Äôre 8
---
Yeah, i see why it's hated. Too many pipers, and too much teaming in final circle
---
So many defeat because of this bug it didn't happened before, 
---
It happened after my game got updated with optional update which was supposed to fix it irony
---
MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA
---
Week 1: robo rumble 
---
Week 2: boss battle
---
Week 3: boss fight 
---
Week 4: robo rumble
---

---
Once a month = 12x a year
---
Every 3 weeks = 17-18x a year
---
While yes it falls on the 1st week and 4th week they're only 3 weeks apart. It might not seem like a big difference but that is 12x a year for once a month and 17x a year if you started the cycle with something not robo rumble and 18x if you started the year with robo rumble l.
---
No there Mortis‚Äôs
---
Idk i guess not, though I got gene probably 5 months after my last brawler via brawl box. But good luck to us finding Leon soonü§û
---
Good meme but you needed to get the blank format for it to have worked better
---
Cause I like rico
---
Didn't know he was famous outside Spanish Brawl stars community
---
Don't worry, I did it on your part
---
The reason why is he plays fortnite and no one likes a person that plays that game even brawl stars
---
Satire
---
Tbh, it is Chinese traditional holiday.
---
So this is what he turns into with his super
---
I really think that star power should be like dyna jump, if you have skill its op if you don't its trash rather than low skill cap sp
---
Dang. That Shelly's been playing since 2018.
---
Swore
---
Buff chemicals, nerf glass
---
Lol
---
How u gonna do that to me
---
No he means 
---
&gt;no, there Mortis is!
---
Oh haha, I was just being funny. Yes no problem.
---
:)
---
so i should get that one then
---
I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm there still but I was second for crow in Australia yesterday
---
Piper looks THICCC
---
He's so happy
---
üòÇüòÇ I love how you made that in class but u LOVED it, mind sharing a tutorial with us???
---
If you in dev build their might be new brawler that makes walls
---
Unfortunately I died..but I lived!
---
I love the Mortis‚Äôs name
---
Great reason to push your other brawlers. Genius.
---
At 0:06, pay attention to the sticks. The movement joystick suddenly freezes on neutral position and the aiming joystick tries to go left - you can even notice that OP's still mashing auto aim and even then the stick goes left.
---
It lasted a moment in this video, but i've had it last longer sometimes.
---
So?
---
Hello
---
I still respect him as a player and content creator
---
Nope, Normal Game
---
It is easier to push by playing 3v3 , but many players, including myself, lack friends to do so lol. Playing with randoms is just a waste of time
---
Thanks bro
---
Its a tenplate so many other people can use and not only one so anyone can use this and make a joke about it
---
He‚Äôs not good at either. Patchy carries him. Or he teams in solos. And I‚Äôll take kairos, lex, or oj over ash any day.

Just a OP crow depending on speed
---
I don‚Äôt know man... I‚Äôm at 13000 trophies and I feel like she‚Äôs pretty easily countered. I don‚Äôt see her played at all but even if she is theres usually a range brawler that can deal with her pretty easily
---
Idk
---
I laughed \*WAY\* to hard at this
---
I'm at 4700 but still dont have any legendaries.
---
I always wait until my teammate resplendent unless another team is trying to rush me or I am a melee brawler and pick up the cubes on accident. There‚Äôs is absolutely nothing more infuriating than a random who doesn‚Äôt not wait to pick up the cubes. (Yes I know teaming is technically worse but at least it doesn‚Äôt cause me physical pain)
---
It looks awesome and looks fun to play on too! Kinda similar to deserted vertex :3 I can‚Äôt wait for more ‚ÄúDarryl rolls into cactus‚Äù memes
---
The crow is the BEST on the leaderboard rn tho
---
I think with the newest update. I didn't know about it until I used him and now his attack is basically like 60% of Shelly's range
---
Fuck this star power
---
I believe other ppl changed their name similar to him as a joke, so theyre different ppl
---
Nice
---
Supercell loves alts, got Rico at 700 on my 2nd day of my alt
---
You can't bunnyhop in brawl stars they said
---
FOOLS
---
Haha, nice! This is my favorite brawl ball map, so great job with it!
---
I‚Äôm just giving a friendly reminder with no regards to the title.
---
Perfect
---
Wait. Pam is Jessie's mother?
---
Thanks a lot!
---
The post?
---
Yes
---
Took me nearly a year to get Leon. Got him at 10k.

i call is sickobear

*Cjip Cj√∂p*
---
Exactly, the power levels are not accounted for
---
Don't lie 
---
yes I went to your profile and yes you are a good artist

Yeah so what it‚Äôs about skill not power
---
Jarate Time.
---
Bl√Øp Bl√∂p
---
nO hAt MoRtIs TrAsH  lMaO
---
Lol haha
---
I was too late for that
---
I bet Pam will be the next to get a remodel. El Primo will probably be last due too having two skins that also require remodels
---
He friended the bull
---
^^^^ok
---
Really good idea man it‚Äôs creative
---
can you draw him naked tho
---
Well I have only the mega box because I make about 1500 sp per season and I got a star power from every mega yet
---
Only with his super
---
U are not funny
---
No we shouldn‚Äôt be encouraging gambling!!!! /s
---
That's on BlueStacks, no?
---
Wwll criw has the fastest speed in game while leon doesnt
---
Yes, Colt and Pam are in fact Jessie's adopted lesbian mothers.
---
Why is Spike a pervert? I could call FBI right now and arrest him üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Well yeah i do main him since i play mostly leon
---
Not the brawler sucks, the BAD playes sucks with them
---
So get your brawlers to a higher rank (600+) and you likely won‚Äôt encounter any bad mortis or piper players
---
Here i am after a year with no legendary
---
-cough cough- another low effort 69 Joke
---
You‚Äôre going to hell.
---
Bcrow
---
My friend, I'm way past there and trust me, they are still there. I think it's safe to say there's no escaping them. They are characters that make people feel cool but are so easy to play poorly.
---
Nah
---
yes
---
Showdown bad
---
I have light mecha bo as well and regret it because now I am just scraping by in star points to get the mega box and not even the big box
---
[Is that so?](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=gYHoc7PqCMY)
---
Yeah, but I think it's safe to say that there are just SO MANY Piper and Mortis players that there is just more people who suck with them. 
---
What I'm saying is more often than not, Pipers and Mortis are bad players. If you get one on your team, you're more than likely gonna lose.
---
Ïò§Ïö∞
---
Agreed it‚Äôs a little too much
---
Got spike at 3000
---
Snappy sniping piper, in bounty, some gem grab maps bad??
---
Mortis tho however isn't bad but has the highest learning curve in the whole game, top mortises play very differently from you
---
Nice.
---
HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!!!
---
Same with the enemy. 50/50 i guess
---
It's a good idea and you can always outrange the rocket so it would be OP but acceptable as a star power and it could be added to the game
---
That's what is said
---
Yeah I would‚Äôve tried to explain that but the google search bar isn‚Äôt that big haha
---
 6/2/19 February Maintenance ChangesMatchmaking Improvements
---
* "Pooled" Matchmaking added
---
* Different matchmaking pools based on players' Total Trophies
---
* Playing in a game room uses the highest pool that a player has in the room (for example if a 450 Total Trophy player plays with a 2500 Total Trophy player they will play in the higher 2500 Total Trophy pool)
---
* Play Again button is now enabled at over 150 Trophies
---
* Prevention mechanism for trophy push exploit
---
This is scary
---
Happens because there is not enough people in your pool, either you get some worse players or you wait 20 min for a game. Stop crying and get over it.
---
Did you buy a license for PaintTool SAI? I saw your video post, and was just curious. Also the art is amazing!
---
I think you are right but I prefer waiting for a fair match instead of having to carry.
---
Gold mecha crow basically a pikachu
---
But u literally did nothing for 2 weeks and you can get almost 9 boxes for free.
---
Jessie thinks her mom is ugly, now this is a BRUH MOMENT
---
Great idea, take my up
---
I did‚Äôn thougth that hehe BRUH
---
Have you even read the rules of this subreddit? There's a SPECIFIC PLACE for you to post stuff like this. r/BrawlRecruit
---
Yes. Now imagine colt and Jessie in an incest doujinshi
---
And what about crow nobody cares about him :‚Äù(
---
Ah yes a fellow pre order Shelly skin user
---
Well tbf he has been sharing n1 spot with twisti many times..I would even go further and say he is top3 in the world
---
Very Underrated, Should've Had At Least 2K Upvotes Now... But Still GG! Man U Are So Pro!
---
Yeah
---
I love how you accept your fate
---
When you gonna come out as transgender Kairos. We‚Äôre all waiting..
---
Spike's new Star Power: CreepyCactus
---
Causes all players to avoid contact with Spike
---
This is so stupid everyone has this offer but me what is this bs
---
Yeah he does
---
What skin? Skin concept or actual skin?
---
Nope
---
Thanks, but as soon as I turn off the WiFi, the game kicks me out, but it doesn't matter because I found another way
---
I had dynamike and bo at 1000 trophies
---
ME TOO!!!! NO STAR POWER!!! WTF!
---
I‚Äôm 5 gems off
---
Not random thts your friend
---
"Quack Quack"
---
Wow, impressive nice to see.You're lucky! ;)
---
*insert depressing naruto music*
---
Brawl ball, needs 3 so they had a random
---
Oh damn
---
Leon is a very cool and awesome looking assassin, he cannot have a cringe voiceline. A voiceline like Bo.
---
I also posted this on r/dankmemes
---
YES!!! I BOUGHT TOO OMFG SUPERCELL THX!!!! 111 GEM DISCOUNT!!!! WTF!!!!!!
---
Bo's ulti actually like detective item. People need be careful! :)
---
So basically primo is a rare brawler so you get him very early in the game. But then the guy in this image got and epic and two legendaries which means he got legendaries and an epic when he is probably below 1000 trophies
---
save your gems, royal agent colt is coming back this weekend because of the lunar event.
---
üò∂üò†üòûüòñ Sorry for u guys
---
Sorry I don‚Äôt speak Minecraft enchanting table
---
Lmao spike is actually girl!
---
Alright so this is equal with my legend brawler percent :o
---
He/She shoots bat lazers that knock back opponents?
---
*instructmenal music*
---
 To reminisce...cry more
---
Cool but what if you wouldn't see xD
---
Your comment
---
Kinda 10k isn‚Äôt much anymore.
---
Cue Soviet anthem
---
I mean tomorrow leon releases anf i am mot sure wich is better
---
Probably that means they can be now upgraded to level 9. Unfortunately I have 549 of 550 Shelly power points
---
Yes. Its better than 60 gems
---
Well seeing 50 of them gets boring, especially if it's most of the community
---
EPIIIIC!
---
Hey, i thought max discount is 69 for skin with price 150 gems
---
For sure
---
Why u bully me?
---
gone,  reduced to atoms.
---
So you have chosen... *D e a t h*
---
Yes, what a discount. The only reason I didn't buy it was cause I already have night witch mortis
---
When you dont have enough gems for Rockabilly Mortis
---
It looks like a gas mask at first when i looked it.
---
Thanks for the shout out and consoling me on this great loss
---
H√´lp I can't sleep there are m√∂nst√´rs n√´√§r by.
---
No he didn't, but when I played with him, he played him as if he was playing bull
---
I want Darryl's skin :(
---
Wait tomorrow for Leon Skin
---
Sure is lol
---
what's the song used?
---
Same
---
Oh you‚Äôre talking about this sub, then yeah your right
---
Teaming noob luul (at the end)
---
Well done
---
I wanted to ask this ecact same question!
---
Oh okay, thanks!
---
R.I.P
---
What if he doesn't have leon ?
---
Thats some next level gameplay.
---
Welp u could wait for a discount on shark Leon if have
---
Cuz 39 gems is really cheap af
---
Big brain time
---
How
---
Instabuy, didn't even think about it.
---
Oh it‚Äôs Rico tips I think
---
exactly
---
I guess thats your opinion. Most 30 gem skins are just recolors so eehh
---
The three buns reastaurant is great and amazing.
---
Yeah but im waiting for the leon offer. People are telling me that it is gonna be tomorrow and im saving gems and imma buy some for the offer. So idk :/
---
Yah it‚Äôs you thanks again Ive improves with him now still trying to temper to move where I‚Äôm shooting
---
i started saving 2 months ago for his skin .. i got like 91 gems ... i was so happy man .. got the skin on my main and mini
---
Lmao
---
Now look at this net, that I just found
---
Seems busted, but it might work
---
Congratulations!
---
I wanted to win but seeing a person winning it makes me happy :')
---
how did you got that many most i got was 1400 if i remember correctly
---
if you think 69 jokes are funny you should go back to r/dankmemes
---
Yo should use YouCut for this things, it doesn't have watermark
---
So shelly can‚Äôt ult 1029489202 times.   And a few other heroes that chain their ults too well
---
So shelly cait spam her super
---
yeah na yeah cheers mate
---
Bruh. You‚Äôre at 7k and doing balancing?
---
How many brawlers do you have
---
I like where this is going
---
Ok so we know he has more than 6K because he has 8-Bit.
---
So if I am correct he is between 8 or 11K
---
Lol the Daril is a noob player HAHAAHAHAHAHAH
---
Thanks:)
---
Whhaaat!!? How do I get it tooü§ëü§ë
---
There is devil in the spike üëøüëøüëø
---
I know it's so bad but it must be so bad beacuse come on it's just a meme with cap from internet and t-shirt maked in paint
---
Tell me what anime this reminds you of because I think it‚Äôs from somewhere
---
The 3rd guy was random
---
i have 29 gems rip
---
3rd guy was random
---
How nice. I just got my second leggie at 13k.
---
r/shittybrawlstars
---
i just need 10 gems to buy it
---
I want royal agent Colt too. I don't care.
---
How do I continue this
---
Idea: dont be a broke ass
---
I did that 5 mins ago with no regrets
---
r/thebrawlstarscactus for the uneducated
---
I don‚Äôt remember seeing that in the balance changes. Also, that story took place before the update
---
Thank
---
i know, my post is really boring, i will keep that in mind next time, thx y'all!
---
an* you missed grammer
---
I don't even have enough gems to buy it and Supercell is bad with me... Fucking videogame empresses
---
Pretty good idea
---
Exactly what I expected
---
*shelly*
---
a* high starts with a consonant
---
We should at least get og versions of the skins
---
Its big brain time
---
Tf
---
Hey you're the one watching the compilations
---
I know, that's the point of my memes. No sense
---
Brawl stars is as F2P as it could be, and y‚Äôall keep on asking for more free stuff..
---
The bull speaks for the trees
---
Blame whoever is teaming with him
---
How do you kids even understand each other
---
No, this is reddit
---
Hey! I had this too!
---
YOU HAD LEON WTF
---
I swear I've gotten free gems?
---
It‚Äôs still luck
---
?
---
Oh, from what giveaway did you get it?
---
Removed - DO NOT SUBMIT POSTS WITH TITLES IN ALL CAPS. CAPS LOCK IS CRUISE CONTROL FOR COOL
---
Well you can have leon for free if you get him from free brawl box
---
ah its no longer exclusive, bt i guess a welcomed move for those who want it!
---
Nice colt drawing very detailed
---
Everybody did

How you Do it?
---
Lol but not it's just keeps goin to the corner of the screen without me touching there must be a compatible bug because it only happens in brawls stars
---
You mean Ricochet
---
Shitpost. 
---
Worthy of r/shittybrawlstars
---
Don‚Äôt you just love it when you get a kill as Piper at close range
---
I get you point and i agree with that. Some body still post because they want, not because they care about the game.
---
A new art stoler to delet from reddit
---
Star power?
---
yos
---
She loves being thicc
---
They work together
---
Explosive
---
My yungin man you is level 1
---
They probably just left it up for everyone to enjoy
---
90% of the time it‚Äôs just luck as they usually don‚Äôt have the reaction time. 
---
Another 5% is a skilled player being able to dodge shots properly and the other 5% is the opponent having a horrid shot.
---
Both are amazing and it depents on your playstyle. If you struggle to stay alive use the heal SP. If you struggle to deal DMG use extra noxious
---
When you don't have Brawl Stars
---
Yeah that's how Instagram works basically üòÇ he gives credits at least!
---
the whole ‚Äúdaily gifts‚Äù thing is a tactic to keep players coming back to the game daily. it‚Äôs the same thing in clash Royale, if you just open up the app for a couple seconds you‚Äôre already rewarded. and tbh, the rewards on BS for playing aren‚Äôt that good.
---
Add funny moments
---
Not in a club :(
---
But pam likes teaming, atleast she did on island invasion
---
is this small screen glitch permanent? i would be happy about it if so.
---
Ikr
---
noone. and stop it, please.
---
no children talk about it. NEITHER.
---
every brawler has a chance in this map
---
So nice that you even edited it faster xD upvoted
---
When you don't have a phone
---
Look at my profile or brawl stars Korean youtube channel
---
3 Ls though
---
r/madcacti
---
trophyroad could also use free gems
---
you shouldn‚Äôt need gifts to want to come back to a game. I‚Äôd enjoy this game just as much if there weren‚Äôt gifts because it‚Äôs a fun game
---
and it‚Äôd be stupid if they were exceptionally good, because then Supercell wouldn‚Äôt get any sort of reward for their F2P game. who would buy gems if you were getting a daily big or mega box?
---
Brawl stars really needs this coz u rarely get gems from big or brawl boxes.
---
üòë
---
Same but i already have 80 so its a tough decision with the mortis
---
Who can forget
---
I did that once and got absolutely nothing
---
RIP my 119 gems I‚Äôm not buying that again

What if I survived with 7hp?

Your flair checks out on that
---
And you can spell like a god.
---
There is something called a lab coat
---
Huh?

Gravity falls? Yes

---

---
You already have leon right ( before giveaway I mean )
---
Yes. But its different from ÍøÄÎñ° which looks similar to ÏÜ°Ìé∏ but ÍøÄÎñ° has a honey and other stuff in and ÏÜ°Ìé∏ has a bean paste stuff lol 
---
Both ate sweet tho
---

---
Not funny I'm at 10k with 20 brawler
---
Ur welcome
---
and rosa
---
The devs were already nice enough to make it so it‚Äôs possible to get free gems from brawl boxes, isn‚Äôt that enough? At least you have to earn gems by winning tokens and playing games but just logging in and getting free gems is making an already f2p friendly game much more f2p friendly
---
He is jealous of you
---
–î–µ—Ä—Ä–∏–ª —Å–ª–µ–¥—É—é—â–∏–π?
---
cool
---
Well. Maybe but technically China isn't the only country who celebrates lunar new year
---
Well. The Mega box and Big box, are in theory 13 boxes. So we get more value nowadays
---
#
---
how u bois so lucky?
---
to be fair we aren't guarenteed that any skin will eventually return. and im sure if theyre willing to make a 150 &gt; 39 discount for whatever occasion they probably will do it again.
---
200 trophies in one day‚Ä¶ you‚Äôll be playing to much brawl stars now
---
ah
---
You don't understand what I am trying to say
---
Good job
---
Ya I know lol I messed up
---
I am praying popcorn would come bacc with 69
---
Very big flex
---
thats the joke
---
Imma nwm user
---
It‚Äôs a glitch
---
Seriously? Its true! Look at my post or korean brawl stars community poll
---
I think Leon shouldn‚Äôt have voice acting
---
You have to shoot
---
Is that sketch (the app)? Is absurd that is made on mobile!
---
REQUESTING BACKUP!
---
8-bitch
---
&gt; an 300
---
Only his animation changed i think.
---
I had 69 Gems so I bought it
---
If ifs mortis im making ww1,2,the vietnam war and the civil war all togheter be a tea party
---
Youl get those power point of offers for the brawler of your choice. Those are the best value IMO.
---
Oops it seems two of them are Shelly and Rosa so please confirm again.
---
The only thing that's worse than bratty kids is the asskissers that post these type of shitty posts
---
This is russian youtuder ICEARROW. And it is prepreg to teaming. I HATE [–ë–õ–ï–¢]
---
nascar please
---
IM FUDGING STARTING TO MAKE WW1,2 AND VIETNAM WAR ADDING THE BIG AREA 51 RAID LOOK  LIKE A TEA PARTY
---
No they are no.t the token doublers the most worth
---
I'd use them for skin, you'll find all the brawlers soon or later
---
Just giving him attention.
---
I don't want to come off as rude or toxic, but my dude if you're scared about posting something on reddit, i can't imagine but picturing you being scared of everything. Life is a game of survival and i hope you find your courage in time so that it doesn't eat you up
---
I
---
Me too
---
I'm so mad at myself that i used the gems on bandita shelly a long time ago and now this popped up, i hope they make a 80 gem skin like 20 gems offer or something
---
Watch out Mr. Video Game! Oh wait *wahoos in the background*
---
Then he can buy the skin for Mortis
---
He gave up at the start of the game
---
I love them :)
---
Wow that peromo tho
---
Bro u wouldn‚Äôt have all skins u can see the un-bought barley skin in the background why people gotta lie to sound cool
---
r/foundthemobileuser
---
That's cause they're pro players, this is still quite a bit
---
I literary said that this isent mine in the title genius
---
Stfu bitch
---
I agree. There weren‚Äôt ‚ÄùJuhannus‚Äù -special packs..
---
The aim of this is to prove a point. The fact I literally rushed this and left for school as soon as I got, only responding when I turned data on in school, the fact I am not a native English Speaker, and again, that I am a normall human being, who's brain can sometimes get distracted and not deliver everyrthing 100% perfect for you smart people of Reddit - that is not a valid argument againts this post.
---
Yes this big brain time gets Over nice levels
---
Bruh
---
OP would not discuss this-
---
*reloads gun*
---
Take your time! Sorry if I‚Äôm coming across as really impatient; just excited, haha
---
WoW
---
they gonna offer agent colt again
---
I‚Äôm not complaining
---
My friends are literally at 4k-5k trophies 
---
I have double their trophies so that won‚Äôt work
---
He is a fucking Snorunt
---
I'm with you on that. I just get that star every 24 hours and then play different modes
---
My shortest time on brawlball is about 16 or 18 sec
---
Made with WeVideo.
---
Exactly the same
---
There's credit on the picture...
---
spike: why do you look like you happy about it?
---
Once it's over the game's dead.
---
Discount an item. Before a new release. Stonks 101. Do I see a Gold Mortis coming? Idk
---
I have 110 tickets ready to spend
---
Bruh I have like half of my brawlers at 500 anyway so that‚Äôs my milestone
---
ok. quick question. why would bother making this shit, if i have better things to do? why waste my free time doing what this kid did in art classes?
---
Fam thats gedi kors watermark. If his real intentions were to raise awareness of gedi kors work hed talk about him or mention him as a great art creator. Copypasting his art and then saying 'new skin idea' doesnt give any credit. Its stealing content. Try to look out for stealers and be more cautious.
---
Man I really want bibi she seems so cool :(
---
..mortis gang approves those vampire teeth.
---
I prefer classic top hat
---
ive been controllin it that way for years
---
Calculated risk*
---
You have to be out of range to not take damage? No thank you.
---
Doesn't matter.
---
thats the worst excuse yet, gotta step up your game buddy
---
True. I always get triggered when Someone uses a "wrong" or "not correct" terminology 
---
For example... 
---
Big Brawler [O] Boss [X]
---
Robo Boss (old name) [X] Angry Robo [O]
---
And such..
---
So don't Play heavys
---
On showdown
---
Thats what happens when you have two throwers on your team
---
Have you just discovered the training cave
---
IKR
---
True that's why they changed the animation and I found out on lwarb.
---
Yeah you correct i am at 8750
---
Dentist
---
This man opened a brawl box and became Crow
---
Fookin op
---
reason for downvote?
---
8750
---
Wtf i bought it for 69 months ago now its 39 ain't this a bitch
---
Gimme ur phone
---
r/youngpeoplereddit?
---
*Hehehe My calculations are always correct*
---
Instead of shooting rockets you shoot photos
---
(Badum tsss)
---
Spike is always watching 
---
*thumps*
---
What the fu-
---
I have 8750 trophies
---
Thumbs down for your idea of reposting and stealing.
---
You need to get rid of the one block gaps for it to be more playable. (Fence posts)
---
I also dreamed about El Primo's remodel 
---
It was sort of a nightmare though
---
Yea, i think his super didn't heal, it just destroyed everything and made damage, and you know how big the attack is, so you could easily hit 2-3 enemys with it everytime you used it
---
This is a really good one!
---
I think a perisol would also look nice
---
Wen‚Äôt.
---
Shitty post
---
I‚Äôm sorry but that‚Äôs absolutely not happening
---
You have arms, assert your dominance
---
I had to buy him with the discount. Pained me to look fabulous
---
10900 is honestly garbage. Even I we assume you have 22 brawlers, that‚Äôs an average of less than 500 a brawler.
---
I do deserve to be r/woooosh
---
Some are, but coming from a person who has the word 'fortnite' in their name, I wouldn't take this seriously
---
NEVER A SKIN I WANT TO BUY OR DONT HAVE
---
Plus one
---
Honestly I'd love the 10th option on April Fool's
---
No, I don't think I will. OG is no longer part of the game.
---
Leon
---
For everyone who wants to know how many trophies i am - 8750
---
BTW My name is Crazy K in BrawlStars
---
I was just in the mindset that everyone is on twitter and is followed to Brawl Stars. Crediting Supercell does feel a bit off, but I can tell you that Paul/@pawchaw is an artist for Brawl Stars and he is the one that drew all those images. If I were to credit an official post by Supercell, I‚Äôd rather credit the artist themself rather than the big company because that just feels right.
---
Amazing drawings, hope you finish it up with the rest of them(looking forward for el primo)
---
Hotter than El Primo
---
what was her band-aid before nerf?
---
Haaha funni btw im reporting you
---
In a few years, in 2020 people will be complaining about oG rEmOdELs, and bRiNG bACK olD gENe. They'll be considered OG if the game is around for that long.
---
Tencent, one of the biggest corporations in the world, is Chinese. Supercell was bought by them around three years ago. Much more people celebrate Asian and Chinese holidays than Finnish ones.
---
Godamn kids
---
Im piper main and was sniper main in other games. 100% agreed. I'd love if sniper never existed in games. But weirdly enough I can play only as sniper :/
---
I got gene at 2789 trophies
---
Definitely better than demolition if you can master it.
---
I‚Äôm so sick of this ‚Äúbad randoms‚Äù crap. Are there cases where there are bad randoms? Yes. But if you‚Äôre not able to win at least 50% of your games with randoms, you‚Äôre the problem, not them. And until you get to 700, winning 50% is all you need to advance. Slowly, yes. I pretty much exclusively play with randoms or solo and I never have any trouble pushing all 28 of my brawlers to 700+ each season.

remove the fences and then it will be a very good map
---
When you dont have rocket number 4
---
the n-word. There, i said it!
---
DoUu
---
I kno
---
These are well done!  Spike, Tara, and Scrappy are my favorite
---
Poco lookin HELLA THICC!!
---
Those are awesome! Your a great artist :D
---
And pipers teeth. Good work
---
It's always the weekend somewhere.
---
Thanks!üòÅ
---
Kkkkkkkkkk essa supercell
---
Hol up
---
[I did not find the button to leave](https://i.imgur.com/I4h2Pnt.png)

*happiness noises*
---
Keep doing a goo work like this and maybe supercell uses one of yoir skins in the game
---
lol nice catch XD
---
They didn't.
---
Weird! I‚Äôve never been VP so I guess I don‚Äôt know.
---
Have you tried promoting a senior to VP first?
---
Try the dart goblin
---
If you have not already, join r/brawlstarscompetitive
---
There are some pretty good guides and tips on there
---
In brawl stars, it is not efficient to push one brawler a lot, make sure to push all of your brawlers 
---
Other than that, just make sure to play every day or so to get your star tokens for big boxes, and tokens for normal boxes
---
Enjoy!
---
Bloodocean643 
---
9213 trophies
---
Player code 8lvyqcqup
---
To be fair, nothing survives a full health el primo jumping on them anyway
---
I survived with 1 hp
---
Keep practicing and get that timing down
---
Yea i thought that too, but i've seen enough crows trying to kill shotgunners close range, also pipers who try to kill others close range, or dynamikes who try to kill others close range, at 500 and up, most know how to play their brawler, but not always, i once played duo sd with a randome dynamike and he run to an enemy leon and tried to kill him on close range, he didn't do any damage to him and died (this dynamike was on 750 trophies)
---
It's already kinda annoying to deal with as it is, its pretty balanced
---
Chinese New Year is in like February lmao.
