Damn lol.

That literally applies to every brawler.
---
They buffed her damage in the past, and now they narrowed her spread down and increased her range to Crows and Tara as a shotgunner.
---
A mid-range shotgunner doing 1-1.5k damage at midrange.
---
Not only that but she’s unkillable.
---
She’s broken as fuck no matter how you look at it.
---
She used to be decent with an op super/SP when people said she was “trash” and now they made her a fucking god.

Indeed. I thought for sure I was gonna mess that shot up.

Wait, what. Lol. That's why people spin? I always just spun for fun!! Haha! Anytime I heard teamers I always thought it was about that glitch. Man I would spin even in non-showdown games too. I definitely seen people spin around me and I would spin too and then just kept attacking. They probably like wtf. And you right, I seen that a lot more with my 300+ characters.

Not really... Old gold ricochet was the worst 30 gem skin of all time, and it was horrible. Just look at it. All they did was recolor the body, and the gold doesn't blend in with the rest. Stop being biased.

her new star power, it heals her up to full health whenever she gets below 40% health and has a 20 second cooldown

Is this a bad time for me to interact?

Reaper should be darryl but it's very nice. Do pharah brock and road hog gene next.

No... crow was balanced before he got the buffs. With increased damage now, really quick reload speed, and his poison literally lasting forever, he is unbalanced.
---
Over 5100 trophies and still no legendary
---
I think Jessie should be torb and ashe should be nita and roadhog can also be gene
---
maybe?

Nice, no more albine cacti. Looks good!
---
IM TOO GOOD
---
What no?? After getting it once it's super fast to charge again. If you compare it to other supers in the game you'll realize how fast it charges. For close range characters she's only slower than Daryll... And she's not like the only character that has to get all the shots to get it fast... More than half of the characters have to do that. Even there she has a great range for both her super and the normal attack, her super allows her to  control enemies, cancel supers, do massive damage and destroy blocks without being destroyed on hit. Her super is arguably one of the best in the entire game bandaid just makes it so that she can get her super always in almost any battle...
---
Bandaid also renders totally useless in showdown against her bull, Leon, crow, primo and Darryll against her as they can't win...
---
Halabuhahaha

Nope just needed to embarrass my sister to thousand of people cause she did it to

I guess you could say he wanted to Pipe(h)er

r/ManchesterUnited

He's broken and needs a complete rework.

Shorten his range,  remove the delay effect and boost his health pool.

I use friendly mode to tell

I’ve spent some money on the game. But I had like over 600 tickets and got hundreds of boxes from special events. That got my brawlers levels up.   I also played in the beta version when it first came out. So I had some levels already for a couple of brawlers.

Its a modded version.

Not a bug, since you can go in a matchmaking solo, and you get a duo partner as the same brawler you play

I bought rockstar Colt and I was thinking of getting of gold Rico until they changed him.
---
I can see how tall the brawlers are by this glitch, and i gotta say frank looks way taller than he actually is lul
---
No u
---
Heh, u had to max him.
---
Lol jkjk gud job!
---
When you can't eat your soup

Ah yes. My favorite brawler.

Gene? Brain?

Community awards are 500-4000 coins right?
---
Ok i must actually know nothing about metas because i thought shelly sucked in boss fight but everyone uses her.
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)Piper got a fikk racc ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

I found a Dynamike with the name "Gene" during Siege mode.

His art style is cool, but most of his ideas make no sense at all. His ideas are way too overrated

Very good my boi

That means you are not good in game through cheating you gain trophies in games 😂
---
Different cos you lose more the higher a brawler gets
---
Pls don't rule 34
---
I guess it flops towards you and kills you
---
Xd
---
But you lost?
---
You loose more all around or just for that brawler?

OMG I gotta install this! Rightttt nowwww. I love ricochet so much!

I laughed so hard at Gene 😂😂

r/im14andthisiswoooosh

Lmaooo

What makes the difference I think is his health. He jumps out of the ground near to a brawler to deal damage, but he has very low health. Only tanks have a fast movespeed and this would be a bit of an exception. It also depends if his unload speed is fast like Brock or slow like piper, this affect his burst potential. My suggestion is give him Nita’s range but make the attack thinner, and cut a bit of his speed. His super should either have large range or a temporary health buff, or he  can unload shots at Brock’s speed. However, I would nerf the main attack a bit even though the reload speed is longer, as the burst potential is strong with damage comparable to Tara’s super, furthermore, his attacks pierce, so a good idea would be to make his attacks charge the super up less, much like Tara, make the shots slower like Carl’s pickaxe speed, or stun him when he emerges from super, like for 0.2-0.5 seconds.

Ubercharge me

I mean technically Mortis did get a star power remodel where instead if a skull it’s a green bat

In my opinion bibi is the hottest fuck ugly piper
---
Ikr they’re not *BLACKKK*
---
how can post my frame
---
Ok, you add my frame??
---
Dig with you claws. Btw nerf the attack damage because otherwise this means his final attack damage is 1540, outdamaging penny, Jessie and penny, other piercing brawler by around 400 and Almost outdamages tara.
---
I wouldn’t say overrated, rather impractical
---
That all happend because pros were saying ShElLy iS wEaK NooNe PlAyS hEr in ComPeTitIVe. But not looking at competitive, she was a BALANCED brawler...and now she op because of stupid pros...
---
Ok can someone tell me where the exact standpoint of this cat is right now?! Mr.Bat needs a talking to do with him.
---
im at 10k and i dont have any
---
Poor guy
---
What drawing? All I see is a blank paper
---
„Now where will i put my BIRDIE BIRDIE BIRDIE?“
---
I joined because I got Leon
---
 Look at his profile and his comment history. He doesn't want to do "that" just with Piper, he wants to that with multiple Brawlers even with Mortis, Leon and Darryl. He doesn't have any "real" feelings for Piper he just wants free karma by cpy pasting this comment in every fan art post.
---
Because it is very rare
---
If you want to rejoin, ask someone you know to invite you

i got 12 cubes from killing robots by dealing 4700+ dmg per shot when the game started soo
---
Here's my frame number 19 https://imgur.com/a/vC7IGHj i think it's quite  good
---
Gamer Tag: #8JY8R8L
---
i like damage atm. hes a sharpshooter and his reload is crazy low. for a sharpshooter to go into the center of the battle using his super isnt a normal thing, so he needs high damage
---
LoL
---
what are you talking about tick is so good in some duo sd maps and solos too
---
exactly what i was thinking lol
---
rarity shouldnt affect how easy the character is to play :/
---
Need some more special! New things..
---
**Boss would like to smash BIBI**
---
The reason I struggled with that one was because anytime I got matched in the 3v3 I got placed against throwers and ranged brawlers and because they’re all higher level I instantly got destroyed. The reason I played Showdown was because I actually got a chance with the power cubes.
---
Idk if he is serious or just sracasm
---
Yes!!!
---
brawl stars professional ? how many trophies do you have ?
---
Even without band aid Shelly counters Mortis, i'm not trying to start a war, i'm just honest
---
You can not be serious
---
Like mortis
---
Its just a joke bro.
---
This isnt yours
---
There is an art competition (read the pinned post) and if you win you get 100 gems on your BS account

That literally looks like me lol except my hair is just a little longer and no crab arm lol.
---
Great art! Big fan &lt;3 which art program do u use
---
This is like r/perfectlycutscreams but on brawl stars

All the time 😂

New star power perhaps

Robo Mike shakes because he’s scared to get bought

Man, I got insane II without a single defeat because I have nita with the bear power so I can tank all the damage so even dumb allies can help.

Darryls hitbox is way too phat

Disagree? Tell me why!
---
Why can’t the brawlers just have the English names in all languages?!? Bcs its a name and not a Description.
---
Idk why you write this to be so loooong just say it in short
---
Don’t feed him my guy. Kids on this sub r/woooosh everything they see thinking it’s funny bc they’re new to reddit
---
Where mortis?
---
skin idea:mr krabs
---
Brawlstars=P2W
---
I’d say only let 1 person pick up the cubes. Either a Pam or a Bull, sometimes a Leon. From what I’ve heard only having one person take the cubes is the best strategy.
---
What have you done....
---
Well that matchmaking looks balanced
---
Nah just the Sigma Flower ;)
---
“What’s fun is progressing not playing” you have to play the game in order to progress. It’s big dumb.

What u never played tuber simulator pffft you know its fun right im not supposed to give my opinion but give it a try and then you can tell me if it’s good or not not convinced yet alright I’ll cut you a deal the game is available for free and thats a great price
---
The nursery is what's going on!
---
Ik
---
minecraft Pocket Edition LMAO
---
Yup. Bull or Pam is best for sure. I like bull if he’s smart and can stay alive because his damage output is highest.
---
😢😓😓
---
Ye i have her too , but some thing is wrong with my servers i see . I just lag a lot no matter what my wifi is , even if i try cellular data , it still lags .
---
Bad one.
---
Ah weebs are filling up and im down for it
---
You actually got a good team while i'm stuck with 2 non maxed shelly's which die every 40 seconds
---
It works but only 5040
---
Well the nursery doubles as her lab... But the thing is: That killer plant did not just come out of nowhere.
---
The sad thing is that this meme works with Poco only if ur 800 HP or less, and with brawlers like Bull and Piper it works when ur something between 2000-3000 damage
---
**\*sad noises\***
---
I know! Now with the Brawl Stars DLC
---
I honestly don’t think this would work very well. Star points were meant as a sort of endgame object for people who are maxed out (or almost maxed out). People who are maxed out generally have 6-700 trophies on each brawler, which means around 2500 star points each season, not to mention points they already have for upgrading their brawlers.
---
BUBBLE TROUBLE
---
Ahhhh the only fully true tier here is the F tier, and even tho i'm not sure about Pam, she could've be in D tier, and wtf?! The snipers on A tier?! Dynamike on B and Barely on C tier?! And how the fuck could u think Mortis is S tier?! Carl is in the same category with the  snipers?! How many trophies did u have when u made this tier list and wtf did u think when u made THIS?!
---
Nope, No, Negative, Nah, NOPE!
---
Get used to your past
---
i guess you could say thats......
---
*insane*
---
That's why it needs a buff
---
Yeah, you might go for the 3 megaboxes...
---
I think...(this will probably suprise you) I think that pam needs a buff...she was nerfed, and she kinda fell down if you know what I mean...I no longer see her that often in any gamemode...I dont even see her in gem grab anymore, which was her strongest gamemode...
---
What are they aiming at
---
But that would make him even stronger in brawll ball than now (hes really strong in BB right now)
---
It was just the first difficulty, which really takes no skill to beat other than spamming your shots
---
Tiquets
---
Best man
---
Wait he can shoot a missile?!
---
I meant meme
---
Well the fan art looks better than the actual skins how sad.
---
i have 600 trophies against 0
---
I think around when the game was first released, I remembered some concepts for a chef Dynamike (I remember him throwing ketchup and mustard), so Spicy Mike is pretty cool too
---
^(inb4 mortis circlejerk dinnermike)
---
They should give these skins for free to the creators
---
Yes, he is. Look at his skin, his eyes and his hands. Fix it in ur tier list
---
u/ryan_supercell LITERALLY SAID AI PLAYS IT AGAIN in the community round table #4 (unlisted video)

---

---

---
Yes,I do it with not because I don ' have Brock power 10 bit working on multiplayer battle
---
i dont really even think it works on actual battles
---
BTW sorry for sounds
---
Its just hanzo lmao
---
Got Leon at 4k 😎
---
looks nice
---
They create an unfair unintended advantage for themselves. How is this not bannable?
---
Except it's not an AI. I highly doubt he used the word "AI", and if he did, it was a poor choice of words. AI refers to a special type of program which can gather data from its environment and effectively "learn" from it. Replaying a game given an input of coordinates and timestamps doesn't require that.
---
Facts.
---
I personally think 4500 damage super is a little op
---
... I don't try but... I don't know working but it's a small chance to work
---
Same!
---
Why somedy would think that's photoshopped?
---
Ryan did lemme just give u link to the video and u watch it
---
It's 1500
---
People dont like no-hat mortis
---
Yep hope to see you out in a battle sometime(on the same team of course)
---
Dude Leon is 13 yrs old and Nita is 12 wtf
---
Damn that's 'Insane'

I'll go now

No. You should give them to Pam. If there isn’t pam, Leon and bulls should take them.
---
Seriously stop posting these comments, what's wrong with you people?
---
This entire sub is just one big bad joke to be fair.
---
What? Pocos in a pretty weak state right now, he's got a new starpower, but you shouldn't need a starpower to be op.
---
No, no I don't think I will
---

W h o l e s o m e

A brawler shouldn't need a starpower to be op.

Dang it I was gonna post that
---
r/MortisGang
---
?¿?
---
No? Why? Bulls should never get them.
---
Pam makes sense a bit, she’s got good DPS and her being alive keeps others alive. 
---
But bull? No. As the game goes on, bull becomes more and more useless (can’t get close to the boss). Why would we let someone who becomes more and more useless over time pick up out power cubes over time?
---
Lol they're kicking the Primo
---
why the fuck are people downvoting, he put "/s"
---
that means sarcasm
---
Will they remodel el primo cuz hes arms look weird?
---
I PLAY bull in a lot of matches, and as a bull main, no. He shouldn’t.
---
It's actually not. it looks like it because colt raises his left arm a bit higher than his right. When two Colts are next to each other, it looks strange.
---
i saw a whole different image when i saw the first panel

Before posting any dumb comments just think that someone actually put time and effort on this. If you hate this ship or my art style just downvote and ignore the whole post. If you want to give any tips then fine but please don't be mean.

This is a really cool brawler that SHOULD be added to the game I love people who use a lot of hard effort for really good things thanks for sharing!😁

Great idea! However, the super shouldn’t require you to be close to an enemy as he is a sharpshooter
---
It’s really hard and Mortis will not always find himself in those situations though
---
Not gonna lie I really liked Cat Tara as art, but yeah, things like Bath Carl make me cringe. But hey, at least he is actually doing something for the community instead of making dumb memes from 2016, so I guess that's something.

Yes it is back!

And you still remember that curry idea!

oof i took 3 month break from brawl stars and there are power cubes in boss fight now? or i was dumb enough to never notice it before

Bots will need nerf though before platinum shooter not ends up one shorting half the brawlers

Aww thank you man! And this is not the end!

Hmmm... Is it Rosa's fault tho? 🤔🤔🤔

Oh wait nevermind it's Feast or Famine with energy drink

More like is-helly

A challenging wank.

My gamer tag is #8PUUG8GG2 - Nehama

I hope you will like it :)
---
What if you’re the bad teammate....?
---
Thanks. I reported that
---
Yeah like every fucking company in the world. The point is that you can't prove shit.
---
Nick lied, he wasn't always on you're side
---
I as a tf2 fan don't know what to think of this

Excuse me what the fuck
---
This meme is so fucking bad. If you have to explain it, it’s a bad joke
---
Garbage Shelly lmao
---
OMG I died of laughter on this one hahahahhah 😂😂😂🤣
---
Cant aim? Shelly.
---
No, this can't be real...
---
Did... did you get spike before a mythic?
---
r/Undertalecringe. It's not undertale but it reminds me
---
Oh
---
So shelly is basically immortal
---
She should be with Barley
---
Thank
---
This reminds me of clash royale clan ward
---
Credit to u/BrawlBoi57 for original template and thanks to him for giving me permission to digitize it (and it only cost me 300 gems!)
---
But you got the best one tho.
---
Nope, the best's Spike
---
No. You can invite 6 peoples to playing with you.
---
Is it me, or this feel like every tf2 class fighting the bread soldier keep teleporting
---
#DAMN IT SOLDIER
---
That’s the game algorithm for you. If the game sees that you don’t play as much, it will secretly up your luck chance without visually changing the numbers to hopefully give you more brawlers to have more incentive to play the game
---
Could be better with more salt 🧂
---
It's better to have a bull in there with escape super but shelly works pretty well
---
Frank is a hard-hitting dude, and a real physical specimen. His Super will shock and awe!
---
More likeable at the bo skin
---
All i can imagine now is Pam as a T H I C C Mercy
---
I love it!
---
What

# COINCIDENCES
---
Thanks, dude :)
---
I ain't complaining, but pro tip to get a legendary, quit for like thr hours months then come back, works 100% of th time
---
Your mother did not give birth to you so you can misspell a meme about a mother giving birth.
---
One time I played boss fight, I got a Poco. Poco took all the power cubes and we lost miserably. After that, got salty and played again. Then played with the same poco for #2 more games
---
I think not 🤔
---
Not really :/ he's pretty weak and you'll get the best of him from up close which is hard without bush camping :(
---
Did I misspell something?
---
 I already killed a Darryl and a Dynamike as Piper.  Both had 25 Power Cubes.
---
Ok mr. no-dps and gets killed by the spawning bots while trying to kite boss
---
That timer is for when the next event will change
---
Yea, it’s a theory but a pretty logical one. I had two friends test it. One quit for about a week, came back, then got Bibi in his first brawl box. Other friend quit for a couple days, came back, then got Tara. Obviously not as good as Spike, but you get the idea
---
Not enough dps and too squishy for expert+
---
Look!! He is good for u too. 7-7
---
Owo

Wow. So much pain in this pic. I can only imagine the rage.
---
That’s some amazing artwork but how will her regular attack look like? It can’t be three lasers because her regular attack takes a little to get from Point A to Point B
---
What the hell is that knockup time?
---
Maybe for leon a sight reduction so instead of seeing him in a 3 tile radius it's a 2 tile radius
