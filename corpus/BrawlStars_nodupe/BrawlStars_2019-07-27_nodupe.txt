Damn lol.

That literally applies to every brawler.

They buffed her damage in the past, and now they narrowed her spread down and increased her range to Crows and Tara as a shotgunner.
---
A mid-range shotgunner doing 1-1.5k damage at midrange.
---
Not only that but she‚Äôs unkillable.
---
She‚Äôs broken as fuck no matter how you look at it.

She used to be decent with an op super/SP when people said she was ‚Äútrash‚Äù and now they made her a fucking god.

Wait, what. Lol. That's why people spin? I always just spun for fun!! Haha! Anytime I heard teamers I always thought it was about that glitch. Man I would spin even in non-showdown games too. I definitely seen people spin around me and I would spin too and then just kept attacking. They probably like wtf. And you right, I seen that a lot more with my 300+ characters.

Not really... Old gold ricochet was the worst 30 gem skin of all time, and it was horrible. Just look at it. All they did was recolor the body, and the gold doesn't blend in with the rest. Stop being biased.

her new star power, it heals her up to full health whenever she gets below 40% health and has a 20 second cooldown

Is this a bad time for me to interact?

Reaper should be darryl but it's very nice. Do pharah brock and road hog gene next.

Movement speed should be at least 770, or he will be easily outplayed.

No... crow was balanced before he got the buffs. With increased damage now, really quick reload speed, and his poison literally lasting forever, he is unbalanced.
---
Over 5100 trophies and still no legendary

I think Jessie should be torb and ashe should be nita and roadhog can also be gene

maybe?

Nice, no more albine cacti. Looks good!
---
IM TOO GOOD
---
What no?? After getting it once it's super fast to charge again. If you compare it to other supers in the game you'll realize how fast it charges. For close range characters she's only slower than Daryll... And she's not like the only character that has to get all the shots to get it fast... More than half of the characters have to do that. Even there she has a great range for both her super and the normal attack, her super allows her to  control enemies, cancel supers, do massive damage and destroy blocks without being destroyed on hit. Her super is arguably one of the best in the entire game bandaid just makes it so that she can get her super always in almost any battle...
---
Bandaid also renders totally useless in showdown against her bull, Leon, crow, primo and Darryll against her as they can't win...
---
Halabuhahaha

Nope just needed to embarrass my sister to thousand of people cause she did it to

I guess you could say he wanted to Pipe(h)er

He's broken and needs a complete rework.

Shorten his range,  remove the delay effect and boost his health pool.

I‚Äôve spent some money on the game. But I had like over 600 tickets and got hundreds of boxes from special events. That got my brawlers levels up.   I also played in the beta version when it first came out. So I had some levels already for a couple of brawlers.

Not a bug, since you can go in a matchmaking solo, and you get a duo partner as the same brawler you play

gene is like the opposite of brains, he cant even talk properly lmao

I really believe there‚Äôs a bug involved in the last patch regarding the star powers. I am a real spender on the game trying to get them but this 1% chance is getting interrupted by some kind of bug because before the patch I got them ones in a while.

well I'm at 12.6k with no legendaries, but I do have everyone else tho, so is that better or worse?

What makes the difference I think is his health. He jumps out of the ground near to a brawler to deal damage, but he has very low health. Only tanks have a fast movespeed and this would be a bit of an exception. It also depends if his unload speed is fast like Brock or slow like piper, this affect his burst potential. My suggestion is give him Nita‚Äôs range but make the attack thinner, and cut a bit of his speed. His super should either have large range or a temporary health buff, or he  can unload shots at Brock‚Äôs speed. However, I would nerf the main attack a bit even though the reload speed is longer, as the burst potential is strong with damage comparable to Tara‚Äôs super, furthermore, his attacks pierce, so a good idea would be to make his attacks charge the super up less, much like Tara, make the shots slower like Carl‚Äôs pickaxe speed, or stun him when he emerges from super, like for 0.2-0.5 seconds.

how can post my frame
---
Ok, you add my frame??
---
Dig with you claws. Btw nerf the attack damage because otherwise this means his final attack damage is 1540, outdamaging penny, Jessie and penny, other piercing brawler by around 400 and Almost outdamages tara.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt say overrated, rather impractical
---
That all happend because pros were saying ShElLy iS wEaK NooNe PlAyS hEr in ComPeTitIVe. But not looking at competitive, she was a BALANCED brawler...and now she op because of stupid pros...
---
Ok can someone tell me where the exact standpoint of this cat is right now?! Mr.Bat needs a talking to do with him.

I joined because I got Leon
---
 Look at his profile and his comment history. He doesn't want to do "that" just with Piper, he wants to that with multiple Brawlers even with Mortis, Leon and Darryl. He doesn't have any "real" feelings for Piper he just wants free karma by cpy pasting this comment in every fan art post.

Because it is very rare

If you want to rejoin, ask someone you know to invite you

Gamer Tag: #8JY8R8L
---
i like damage atm. hes a sharpshooter and his reload is crazy low. for a sharpshooter to go into the center of the battle using his super isnt a normal thing, so he needs high damage
---
LoL
---
what are you talking about tick is so good in some duo sd maps and solos too
---
exactly what i was thinking lol
---
rarity shouldnt affect how easy the character is to play :/
---
Need some more special! New things..
---
**Boss would like to smash BIBI**
---
The reason I struggled with that one was because anytime I got matched in the 3v3 I got placed against throwers and ranged brawlers and because they‚Äôre all higher level I instantly got destroyed. The reason I played Showdown was because I actually got a chance with the power cubes.
---
Idk if he is serious or just sracasm
---
Yes!!!
---
brawl stars professional ? how many trophies do you have ?

Even without band aid Shelly counters Mortis, i'm not trying to start a war, i'm just honest

I‚Äôd say only let 1 person pick up the cubes. Either a Pam or a Bull, sometimes a Leon. From what I‚Äôve heard only having one person take the cubes is the best strategy.

What have you done....

Well that matchmaking looks balanced

Yup. Bull or Pam is best for sure. I like bull if he‚Äôs smart and can stay alive because his damage output is highest.

You actually got a good team while i'm stuck with 2 non maxed shelly's which die every 40 seconds

It works but only 5040
---
Well the nursery doubles as her lab... But the thing is: That killer plant did not just come out of nowhere.
---
The sad thing is that this meme works with Poco only if ur 800 HP or less, and with brawlers like Bull and Piper it works when ur something between 2000-3000 damage
---
**\*sad noises\***
---
I know! Now with the Brawl Stars DLC
---
I honestly don‚Äôt think this would work very well. Star points were meant as a sort of endgame object for people who are maxed out (or almost maxed out). People who are maxed out generally have 6-700 trophies on each brawler, which means around 2500 star points each season, not to mention points they already have for upgrading their brawlers.
---
BUBBLE TROUBLE
---
Ahhhh the only fully true tier here is the F tier, and even tho i'm not sure about Pam, she could've be in D tier, and wtf?! The snipers on A tier?! Dynamike on B and Barely on C tier?! And how the fuck could u think Mortis is S tier?! Carl is in the same category with the  snipers?! How many trophies did u have when u made this tier list and wtf did u think when u made THIS?!
---
Nope, No, Negative, Nah, NOPE!
---
Get used to your past
---
i guess you could say thats......
---
*insane*
---
That's why it needs a buff
---
Yeah, you might go for the 3 megaboxes...
---
I think...(this will probably suprise you) I think that pam needs a buff...she was nerfed, and she kinda fell down if you know what I mean...I no longer see her that often in any gamemode...I dont even see her in gem grab anymore, which was her strongest gamemode...
---
What are they aiming at
---
But that would make him even stronger in brawll ball than now (hes really strong in BB right now)
---
It was just the first difficulty, which really takes no skill to beat other than spamming your shots

Wait he can shoot a missile?!

I meant meme

Well the fan art looks better than the actual skins how sad.
---
i have 600 trophies against 0
---
I think around when the game was first released, I remembered some concepts for a chef Dynamike (I remember him throwing ketchup and mustard), so Spicy Mike is pretty cool too
---
^(inb4 mortis circlejerk dinnermike)
---
They should give these skins for free to the creators
---
Yes, he is. Look at his skin, his eyes and his hands. Fix it in ur tier list

BTW sorry for sounds

Its just hanzo lmao

Got Leon at 4k üòé
---
looks nice
---
They create an unfair unintended advantage for themselves. How is this not bannable?
---
Except it's not an AI. I highly doubt he used the word "AI", and if he did, it was a poor choice of words. AI refers to a special type of program which can gather data from its environment and effectively "learn" from it. Replaying a game given an input of coordinates and timestamps doesn't require that.
---
Facts.
---
I personally think 4500 damage super is a little op
---
... I don't try but... I don't know working but it's a small chance to work

Same!

Why somedy would think that's photoshopped?

Ryan did lemme just give u link to the video and u watch it

It's 1500

Yep hope to see you out in a battle sometime(on the same team of course)

No? Why? Bulls should never get them.

Pam makes sense a bit, she‚Äôs got good DPS and her being alive keeps others alive. 
---
But bull? No. As the game goes on, bull becomes more and more useless (can‚Äôt get close to the boss). Why would we let someone who becomes more and more useless over time pick up out power cubes over time?
---
Lol they're kicking the Primo
---
why the fuck are people downvoting, he put "/s"
---
that means sarcasm
---
Will they remodel el primo cuz hes arms look weird?
---
I PLAY bull in a lot of matches, and as a bull main, no. He shouldn‚Äôt.
---
It's actually not. it looks like it because colt raises his left arm a bit higher than his right. When two Colts are next to each other, it looks strange.

Yeah post a random low effort sh*t, tell your opinion in a rude way to make it "comedic" and call the person who's telling their opinion and complaining about the low effort post 12 years old.

Isn‚Äôt it possible to convert a song to midi version?

I‚Äôll send ya Nita‚Äôs bear in just a moment
---
Great idea! However, the super shouldn‚Äôt require you to be close to an enemy as he is a sharpshooter
---
It‚Äôs really hard and Mortis will not always find himself in those situations though
---
Not gonna lie I really liked Cat Tara as art, but yeah, things like Bath Carl make me cringe. But hey, at least he is actually doing something for the community instead of making dumb memes from 2016, so I guess that's something.

Cuz sadly, 80% of the brawl stars players are fucking stinky teamers ):
---
Bo : What a disappointment ...
---
Bibi : On My Gosh!
---
Just fucking stop it's the third time
---
I wish I can , this is what happened , I don't live in America,  I bought a american gift card to buy stuff from brawl stars , but i keep on getting an error when trying to redeem the gift card , so I want to convert it to paypal money,  I can't send you 20$ because where I live there is no e-money lol

No wonder there is no report button

No, this can't be real...

Did... did you get spike before a mythic?

r/Undertalecringe. It's not undertale but it reminds me

Oh

So shelly is basically immortal

She should be with Barley

This reminds me of clash royale clan ward

Credit to u/BrawlBoi57 for original template and thanks to him for giving me permission to digitize it (and it only cost me 300 gems!)
---
But you got the best one tho.
---
Nope, the best's Spike
---
No. You can invite 6 peoples to playing with you.
---
Is it me, or this feel like every tf2 class fighting the bread soldier keep teleporting
---
#DAMN IT SOLDIER
---
That‚Äôs the game algorithm for you. If the game sees that you don‚Äôt play as much, it will secretly up your luck chance without visually changing the numbers to hopefully give you more brawlers to have more incentive to play the game
---
Could be better with more salt üßÇ
---
It's better to have a bull in there with escape super but shelly works pretty well

Frank is a hard-hitting dude, and a real physical specimen. His Super will shock and awe!

Thanks, dude :)
---
I ain't complaining, but pro tip to get a legendary, quit for like thr hours months then come back, works 100% of th time
---
Your mother did not give birth to you so you can misspell a meme about a mother giving birth.
---
One time I played boss fight, I got a Poco. Poco took all the power cubes and we lost miserably. After that, got salty and played again. Then played with the same poco for #2 more games
---
I think not ü§î
---
Not really :/ he's pretty weak and you'll get the best of him from up close which is hard without bush camping :(
---
Did I misspell something?
---
 I already killed a Darryl and a Dynamike as Piper.  Both had 25 Power Cubes.
---
Ok mr. no-dps and gets killed by the spawning bots while trying to kite boss
---
That timer is for when the next event will change
---
Yea, it‚Äôs a theory but a pretty logical one. I had two friends test it. One quit for about a week, came back, then got Bibi in his first brawl box. Other friend quit for a couple days, came back, then got Tara. Obviously not as good as Spike, but you get the idea
---
Not enough dps and too squishy for expert+
---
Look!! He is good for u too. 7-7

That‚Äôs some amazing artwork but how will her regular attack look like? It can‚Äôt be three lasers because her regular attack takes a little to get from Point A to Point B
---
What the hell is that knockup time?

Maybe for leon a sight reduction so instead of seeing him in a 3 tile radius it's a 2 tile radius
