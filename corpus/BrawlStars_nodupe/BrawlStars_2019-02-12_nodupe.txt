I think every one knows that its kind of a act we do when we are full of gem
---
---
---
what does the title mean?
---
Yea I do, although I still remember finding legendary elixir...
---
Oh thank you! I tried to give throwers a big advantage, since you don‚Äôt see many in Showdown, but I still tried to make it balanced between each class :)
---
Spike before 2k, don't be jealous
---
It‚Äôs funny how he drew Phoenix crow because it looks way better
---
what about star powers?
---
Haaaahha

---
Following

yup.

I have 16 saved and one big box

yes 
---
Soo true
---
I really don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs that bad anymore. I‚Äôd rather have Pam nerfed personally. 
---
Is there any reason you aren't able to print screen?
---
The difference of 40‚ÑÖ is because of Life, Attack, and Super stats.
---
Star Powers are like, extras, it doesn't have a exact porcentage of difference.
---
But probably 10‚ÑÖ too or less.
---
No . It just dodge using your movement...
---
They aren‚Äôt even the same brawlers lol

F
---
Don‚Äôt forget Spike and Pam.

Yeah. Only have one Epic, no Mythics or Legendarys

115 boxes and 11 big boxes. Missing Leon and Gene, hope to get at least one. 
---
Meh
---
Yes
---
I know, but some of them give a massive advantage over brawlers who don't have them
---
Or Minecraft Survival Games 
---
Your right bro
---
lol 
---
Well Phoenix crow is cool for sure... but worth it? Nah too expensive
---
If you think brawl stars is the best Battle Royale game, ur dumb. Some games are waaaay better (like pubg even though I don't play it). Stop sucking off supercell
---
The thing that hard to dodge are those things he shhots and if you lose any health its even worse
---
BrawlStars ghosting. ü§∑ü§¶
---
I bought the Lunar Pack to get gems to buy skins. Also, I have no Legendary or Mythic Brawlers, so I'm not in a hurry to get Gene.
---
Thanks for linking my post :)
---
Keep fat fingering my big boxes :)
---
Darryl Gang
---
Which brawler you were playing?
---
Not really that massive. And Star Powers also aren't hard to get, almost the same chance than getting a Super-Rare brawler, which is not hard.
---
I drew it :P
---
It took a long time. But after a while I suddenly got Piper and Leon back to back.
---
Which ones do y'all disagree with? 
---
Yeah it should‚Äôve been pubg since that was the one that started the trend.
---
Piper's star power is reeeally good but it got nerfed harshly when they removed bushes's respawning, and even more now that there are a ton of brawlers that can destroy bushes.
---
Thanks
---
Same
---
first of all this is a repost and secondly click the three dots in the cornerand click choose user flair
---
Thanks for letting me know!
---
why is he trying to eat the rocket?
---
It‚Äôs good because you get so much things to open little box and if you dont have a legandarie your chance go up every time you open a box
---
Gorgeous
---
"It almost felt like a BRAND new gamemode"
---
thats why it was so good
---
wtf why do i hav upvotEs
---
Doesn't matter the context. A fight is a fight. You can play snake, but you still fight like a coward without honor.
---
It was confusing to be part of showdown 
---
Matbe they r planning on a new mode based on LL
---
Hahaha
---
This concept is really tacky also the brawler icon art is sort of weird. Just some constructive criticism.

Looks like it‚Äôll fit

yup twitter

That's like, a double crime.

but its not the same blue and its been confirmed mythic on twitter

My brain just goes ‚ÄúWow how is this dumb Supercell mobile game getting fan art like this I can‚Äôt believe we live in a society‚Äù
---
It‚Äôs extremely annoying
---
whatttttt??? how??? my comp was level 7 colt, level 8 rico and max level leon and we onlt brought the boos down to 8%
---
Rank 19 yet all the player names can be seen...
---
I‚Äôd say intention doesn‚Äôt matter. Winking includes having one eye open and one eye closed. Blinking is when you close all of your eyes, which is what Mike Wazaoski does. Therefore he blinks, not winks.
---
Tara needs a faster reload speed. Am I wrong?
---
Just do the math. 19 gem offer is the way to go.
---
Yeah 100%.
---
Man, I‚Äôm irritated.
---
bwahahhaa

Wow thanks great advice I should do that more often XD

Almost as bad as you stealing karma

300 is a lot considering its 1250 to get to level 9

This reply was made from the Morris gang. r/Morris gang

It‚Äôs all about luck. I am at 0.2352 and haven‚Äôt pulled a legendary. 
---
You're being downvoted but I agree with you, sometimes you actually get at disavantage for killing 0 powercubes duos because his teamate can get the cube and run and if you go hard at it and his teamate respawn while invicible and it's a high dps brawler you're fucked.
---
You a bitch
---
Clutch
---
Africa
---
This is mod, you won't get banned cuz you can play only with bots
---
That'd be pretty interesting actually. You might have a motive for a Leon or someone good to hit you. Some things will probably have to be changed, but this has potential.
---
Yes! Those extra digits really screwed us over.
---
I feel so bad for the new players now because they have to go through what we experienced

Nice quick maths at the end

How tho

Lmao that luck 
---
penny begs to differ
---
Missed opportunity. Should just take this one down. üòÇ
---
lol so many of these 
---
I feel like a poison duration nerf + a damage per dagger buff would be great. Make him more of an assassin‚Äôy character instead of long range poke.
---
On the bright side, they didn‚Äôt loose any trophies.
---
4k, 5k, 6k... This haunts me...
---
DON'T START
---
That is true lol
---
insane :P
---
He's our only Bird
---
Good question, his super won‚Äôt deal very much damage, maybe 400-600?
---
Lol I just had to check my replays to confirm. You're right though
---
this is beautiful
---
Stop acting like a two year old. There is no reason that she can‚Äôt choose a different name.

Whoops wrong number
---
It‚Äôs rewind time
---
What about Jessie 
---
Mortis doesn‚Äôt need a buff
---
Some characters if you auto aim you WILL miss every shot. Gonna have to just get good At aiming your shots and he becomes one of the strongest ranged in the game. 
---
I really do dislike their servers but it‚Äôs also their first multiplayer game with free movement so I don‚Äôt blame them 
---
Thanks.
---
That was Rico‚Äôs pet
---
no the box has the same legendary chance no matter when i open it
---
Took the offer on the discounted mega box and was pretty happy to get my star power. Pam was a long time coming.
---
Maybe star power isn't that rare in boxes? 
---
where can i get these
---
geeeeeet dunked on
---
Buy Brawl Star Plush, they came inside the bags!
---
where can i get em?
---
His last balance change was a nerf so how could he not need a buff?
---
Ok, r/iamverybadass 
---
 From what I saw he is good at tanking and dealing high damage. Stack cubes on him. Pam is good to help distract the boss to let bull heal and help chip. Colt or leon helps clear bots and keeps the missiles away from the other two. Plus bulls charge is great to get away when teammates die and allows for them to respawn.
---
Things like this is why I say his sp is op
---
thanks
---
I just think it should be you lose immunity as soon as you shoot once. Nothing worse than an invincible Bull spawning on you
---
I've had 0 problems with connection but thats just me. I like that they did a better job at this revenue model than clash of credit cards. But yes it is still far from flawless and more community ideas need to be considered.
---
For now its my go to casual mobile game 8/10
---
u/_ditti_ is nub
---
Why did i get downvoted for asking a question?
---
Ultra instinct
---
He seems good in gem grab
---
you got downvoted for no reason, f
---
I guess I have an impersonator that's a meme thief???
---
i don't understand whats wrong. have u just been rage moding through stuff cause i looked at ur past posts and u look pretty frustrated... lol. nothing mean towards u.
---
Nah that sub is for real life. This is bragging about a video game. 
---
His last balance change was a buff, they just nerfed him in brawl ball so he would not be op. He is  more viable in gem grab as aggro, and other modes, plus his starpower has more healing so he can stay in the fight longer.
---
Which is worse. üòÇüëç
---
Ah, very nice. A bear of the polar variety.
---
What a shitty meme
---
I‚Äôm sitting over here with 6.3k and my rarest brawler is Tara. ;-;
---
Purely amazing
---
Ok so first off I‚Äôm a 700 trophy mortis main whose never played him in brawl ball a day of my life. I play him primarily in SnG. His star power change was the worst thing in the world, he‚Äôs barely viable where I‚Äôm at because my team often coordinates to focusfire a target meaning it‚Äôs only 1 in 3 chance I actually *get* the star power at all. The damage buff only changed his interactions on 5 hit brawlers, and like I said I don‚Äôt play him in brawl ball so whatever happened there I don‚Äôt care about. 
---
Either damage buff or a hp buff
---
Then play the game and relize hes still op then question if they really nerfed his damage
---
I get 1 kill in showdown usually
---
that kill is myself 
---
Just some spike tips, fire from around corners and try to use the spikes that scatter around to your advantage on people who are trying to regan.
---
Rip broke boy i got all of em
---
make it like that thanos meme made from reddit watermarks
---
r/facepalm ?
---
Is that nitas head on a stick 
---
O how the mortis gang has fallen since then
---
Shut up ü§ê 
---
I think that he should have 2800 health and 400 damage or 3000 health and  340 damage
---
Have you ever gotten an entire server to agree not to kill each other, it‚Äôs beautiful.
---
wont you get 6 trophies for no.1 instead of 7 if u 500
---
got it, thanks
---
Tara is a girl ? God 
---
Why does he look like he's trying to look away from an ugly woman trying to flash him?
---
FB I deserved that
---
What do they mean by rank 19?
---
Thats actually sad
---
Motherfucker who's name is mohammed should go to hell
---
Congrats! üòÄ
---
I got spike whit that drop rates hope you find something soonüëç
---
El primos
---
Thank you!! What also makes it better is that I am the first one in my clan (a top 225 clan) with a brawler over 500. 
---
Never knew "sueprcells" are dickheads, thanks for telling.
---
Lom√© look how mad you are, it‚Äôs okay kid üòí
---
Why not immumity ?? If no immumity, when your teammate dies, and you get chased, there're no way you gonna win ????
---
I strongly agree with this! Crow having an escape would perfecly fit the assasin type just like Kha Zix, and would greatly impact Gem Rush and Solo Showdown, His stats are fine he just needs more survivability 
---
I don‚Äôt know, but I‚Äôm at 11K and got 1000. 
---
i ain't mad 
---
He snaps and all the gems are gone
---
He needs his chest fixed 
---
Maybe op meant 500 total trophies??? Idk
---
Stop shit-posting
---
Yo, spend some money. That way you‚Äôll be able to win and support the game for all of us as well. 
---
You stole few kills but okay
---
Defo not 500 my dude
---
6+9 so 15 trophies
---
People team because theyre so Bad that they cant win games by them selves
---
Thank you for feedback. I'll get some good tunes playing and see if thats better.
---
No problem. Ya the way his opponent play is undoubted questionable. But recently there a lot of players that get high trophies with others carrying them. Some Japanese YouTuber literally use their fame to collaborate with top player and rank up very fast.
---
I agree that Crow needs a buff, but please don't just lazily increase his damage/health. Instead do a slight rework or make his poison last much longer, even at the cost of some damage reduction. This way would not be yet another burst character, but he will be useful as a support in the way that if you get hit by him you will not be able to regen for a long time. 
---
Ikr!!! I was looking forward for his new attack animation so badly T__T
---
This is my childhood. Thank you for this blessing brother.
---
Nice teamers suck
---
I have 19/ 20 over 500 as a f2p
---
Awesome xD
---
*AWAKEN THEME STARTS PLAYING*
---
Great suggestion!
---
Are you dumb? Have you never heard the phrase ‚Äúbad bitch‚Äù? It‚Äôs not an insult. It‚Äôs commonly used by women to call other women attractive. What‚Äôs not to get? Like ‚Äúshes a bad bitch‚Äù.
---
On the same boat. I have every characters but mythic and legendries.
---
I love Yarn but I have to admit he gets carried every video 
---
Since global update this has been a persistent problem. Bulls at 400 who still auto aim their super whenever they have it etc
---
Thank you so much.
---
Holy fucking shit
---
very nice
---
Holy shit...
---
Ahaha, thank bri
---
ELLLLLLLLLL PPPPPPPPRIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIMMMMMMMMMMMMOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

on joking note: b u l l  h a s  l e f t  t h e  b u s h
---
on a serious note: the floor is darker
---
Thought It was just  me
---
Bro...
---
The poison prevents healing and hiding in bushes... And can debuff oppenents, and you wanna buff him??? 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Sounds good to me. Let's do it. Leon 2.0 for the next wave of gemmers.
---
This is the right move. Buff super to reset on kill, I literally have no complaints with that change.
---
Think of it like this: the game just came out. It‚Äôs basically in the same stance as Clash Royale when there were no legendaries. Give the fame time to grow, it‚Äôll improve greatly over time
---
I use mortis but that works too I guess, gj.
---
(hashtag)NoHatMortisLivesMatter

It‚Äôs not real boys
---
OP
---
This comment is approved by crow gang
---
Why
---
That's why he will take over dynamike
---
When you are stupid so you play a shotgun on the most open showdown map in the game.
---
*When you and another Primo know a Bull is hiding in a bush in Showdown*
---
You aren't the only one cursed with knowledge
---
no 
---
Not from a Colt
---
Lemme get a copy-paste...
---
According to the details Supercell gives, having all rewards of a category increases your chances of receiving rewards from all other categories. Again, I'm forced to take a shot in the dark here and assume how this 'extra percentage' is distributed, but I think I calculate it correctly. Say you only need two legendary brawlers and some power points. If your legendary chance were a generic 0.1%, these percentages would only add up to 94.3%, leaving an extra 5.7% that must be divvied up between these two categories. I do this based on the percentage of the total percent that each category takes up. For example, your odds of a legendary brawler would take up 0.1/94.3 = 0.00106 / 1 of the sum of these 'valid percentages'. Therefore, I would add (5.7 \* 0.00106)% to your legendary chance, meaning the actual chance would be around 0.10604%. It's a small boost, but it's definitely not negligible.
---
If you want this calculated, enter your information at [brawlcalc.com](https://brawlcalc.com) and see your odds per category for a single box.
---
Buff mortis
---
May I ask how many trophies are you? Because just saying "Play the game" does not make any sense. I play the game every day and obv this post was flaired "Humor". I know Leon is still strong but not as much as he used to be. I can easly destroy him with Mortis after the update. 
---
It comes from the expression canary in a coal mine which means to be warned of danger in advanced. This comes from when miners would take canaries into the mines with them that way if the bird died they‚Äôd know that there is a gas leak and to leave before it gets strong enough to kill humans
---
I mean, matchmaking is based off trophies... Really just means people should be able to win more with lower leveled brawlers
---
Agreed
---
I think it should display kills on bounty and gem grab and you should be able to chat between games in duos without leaving 
---
CROW
---
Wait im confuse...Your 3rd team mate are "all but useless"? So you are saying that your teammates are all really skilled players....right?
---
I quit that game the day after this went global. Not because of this game, but because of how greedy supercell  got. They quadrupled the price of some items, pushed out emote packs only in the $20 bundles. And every other game was the same hog rider freeze deck. If it wasn't that it was rage loon with ebarbs. And then matchmaking went to shit when they started the global tournaments. And that was 2 years after launch of CR. Supercell is already greedy at the launch of this game...I only see it getting worse for us while SC profits
---
-0.1200
---
-2 boxes
---
-1 legendary (leon)
---
What's the rate? 
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
WoW bull is nerf?
---
I has 9.8K trophies, played leon only for 3-4 hoursz then get him to 500
---
That happened just today and I was like, hold on, wtf? 
---
I think his super should push enemies away, since he flaps his wings. And it would help with his passive play style 
---
If ur piper is always using her super that means she's a sniper god
---
My mortis is 500
---
Ok,bro
---
Its the best matchmaking i ever seen
---
I have been completely free to play since launch, have teacher over 4750 trophies and still don‚Äôt have any legendaries. I have just gotten bored of the lack of progression and the fullness of loot boxes. I feel your pain man.
---
I a tally had a glitch where every win on the same map gave me a star token, it worked around 16 times it was awesome the best part was I was playing with my friend sitting next to me but he wasn't getting the star tokens, only I was 
---
El Thanos
---
I could honestly live with that...
---
buff barley please
---
And what about 13:14 glitch?
---
I think tt's better
---
Thanks!
---
That was some matrix shit fr
---
Bullshit, u get +7 trophies, this is definitely between 400 to 500. 
---
That Bull really gave you mercy
---
Btw be shure to turn on voice
---
But there is room for a fifth!
---
He has the ten infinity gems... and with one press of the super button he can erase half of your team's chances of winning.
---
I actually like it :). Changes the bounty meta  a lil bit. You can now play frank and poco in bounty more often.
---
Camper
---
*bear witness to my thiccness*(I actually think he says "fitness")
---
Piper is 16 call Chris Hansen 
---
Correction: birb
---
I'm walking here!
---
That dodge against Darryl was so satisfying to watch
---
i am f2p with a mythic and two legendaries
---
Finally, some good content.
---
I think just a longer poison duration and even more reduced dmg. Also reduces healing received by half. 
---
I know but wtf? Feels very out of place
---
YESH
---
It‚Äôs not funny how many gems I would pay for this skin
---
No prob :)
---
Amazing! I bet your trophies are really high!
---
Noice
---
... Arrived to lose all your gems
---
Damn this was awesome. Liked how you didn‚Äôt hesitate to let your supers fly. 
---
Hate to do it but I can confirm, he‚Äôs in my band and his Colt is at 418. Potentially was higher cause he is about 100 below max trophy level. All his 500‚Äôs are 501
---
Can confirm. He sits at 419 currently, could have tilted from closer to 500 tho
---
Should have done this for FB Contest
---
GoOdNeEsS GrAcIoUs
---
Nah hes 9100 trophies 
---
Yeah, I think it would be wise to have star power unobtainable for a brawler until it is rank 15.
---
I **love** it!
---
Do u know what wooosh is? Or are u wooshing us cos u saying woosh is a joke. WHAT
---
Gene + the rock = ‚¨ÜÔ∏è‚¨ÜÔ∏è
---
If he managed to get that many trophies with that level it probably means he's good at bo
---
You probably didn‚Äôt find that funny
---
I just climbed like 100 trophies with him, and I need like 40 to be able to get replays with him. I feel like his hp is a teensy bit low, even on lvl 7
---
Sad
---
Im pretty sure the whoosh refers to dynamike going right over darryl's head, as in the meaning of whoosh being the joke going over your head?
---
Wtf, 8.6 billion?
---
Yeah I think you‚Äôll buy him üò™
---
Yeah I think this is a great idea, it makes sense and fixes his biggest issue: Survivability. 
---
Off topic, but what rank are you in League?
---
Showdown. Duos or solos. Either one is good. Make sure your teammate is strong close quarters in duos. Solos play aggressive or camp. Which ever you feel more comfortable with.
---
It could be 180 to 500
---
Its on purpose lol. They are literally saying how long until the skin comes?!
---
This was not even good
---
I don‚Äôt even have an epic and I‚Äôm around the same trophies as you...
---
I was waiting for this petition /signed
---
Someone has a superiority complex üôÑ
---
üòà
---
hey guys, this isn't an advertisement, I'm just spreading the word that you can play brawlstars on pc and mac, cuz I'm constantly hearing about how annoying it is to play on a phone tbh
---
Impressive! I got 18 once but it was below 300 trophies. Above 300 the best I‚Äôve gotten is 7 I think
---
Don‚Äôt mess with my crew.
---
Yeah. Some people find it harder/easier to play against/as certain brawlers. I can see the reasoning behind every brawler.
---
I‚Äôm new to this game and don‚Äôt own Crow... what makes him weak? Every one says that he is bad.
---
NEIN!!
---
He was my first and only legendary I got, really enjoy using him.
---
I disagree with stopping own goals. If trolling is an issue, we simply need a working report system. Other than that, trying to not walk into your own goal is part of the game.
---

He was the one I wanted most out of the 3 too and I never thought I would get him 
---
The matchmaking patches got disabled again... Real annoying
---
I find showdown tough past 400 to push. If you get the right team pushing gem/bounty is easy. Won 50 / 55 played the other day doing this, you just need the right people using the right brawlers on the right map üí™

But the aim sucks on pc

I still don't know tge reason.
---
He deserved that
---
Crow in 19 rank is fuking god like  my opinion and no offensive
---
I agree. Maybe it's just the amateurness in us but it does feel like you just go back and forth and rarely in between. There is a weird luck component in piper's shot because it's all about predicting where your opponent will move and the hit box is pretty small. So if your target somehow think exactly opposite from what you want him to go your shot will just miss. I even have had instances where I miss a lot then started auto attacking and most of them landed  (because instead of going a single direction, the opponent tends walk very quick steps and back and forth)
---
Maybe pro piper doesn't have this problem at all but yeah. It's super weird. Some opponent you just have a very difficult time hitting as if his brain is wired completely different from yours and you just fail every single prediction.
---
At 1:30 we see a bull in his natural habitat
---
Think 30 post about this üò™
---
Good for you
---
Yeah it‚Äôs weird tho, when they disable it and go back to what it used to be. My matchmaking gets even more absurd 
---
Just stop.
---
Yes, specially for throwers, because you can't throw the dinamites behind your character for example
---
Hackerman
---
Will Smith?
---
I checked his profile (maybe yours if you know what I mean) and there is nothing proving that the person is 54 global. He started posting when the game got released globally so I can asume he is Global player and 100% not 54th in the global leaderboards.
---
Use nox. Not bluestacks
---
Khm,did u see,that all had nicknames?
---
sigh.
---
Push her as much as you can, she‚Äôs OP right now, push her before she got nerfed, that‚Äôs my suggestion 
---
I am actually the one who made this skin. I spent around 5 hours making it. (I have the full recording of me drawing it) It pretty sad to see that someone can just repost your work without giving credit and get 1.6k upvotes! Here are some proofs.

Hey brother! 
---
My daryyl is 470 trophies I think
---
That was happiness when I got the kill... No teaming
---
I don't think he is perfectly balanced... as all things should be
---
I got 147 trophies with Jessie, now she has 469 trophies (power 6)
---
I just used the survival strategy, so huge thanks to KariosTime
---
This is fun to watch! Great job, I bow down to you! Colt is my go-to Brawler if I don't wanna play others, and his Johnny Bravo sauve is just hilarious to me. A lot of people post about the others a lot so seeing a Colt post is refreshing.
---
Just play with club members.
---
Got any others?
---
Change user flair, it‚Äôs in the top right corner on mobile when you are at the main brawl stars subreddit page
---
I think that his super needs to recharge like Darryl's ...
---
Stop saying Leon is OP
---
Essentially it‚Äôs your own fault for going into heist with colt lol
---
9k trophies atm, don't have a single legendary brawler or mythic...  
---
My legendary chance is 0.2139% but I am the unluckiest person in the world... :(
---
Oh ok ! Didnt knew that 
---
life hates us :(
---
I highly doubt that it would waste time since its just a remodel of  a mega box and might i ask whats with all the hate?
---
People would spend less time hiding in fucking bushes all game as well.
---
Yup...
---
r/MortisGang is proud of you
---
Colt is one of the best heist brawlers

I'm pretty sure that the brawler you're playing with needs to be at four hundred trophies.

Often when I try to kill a Mortis as Leon, the Mortis kills me...
---
If a Mortis starts breaking a box close to one of the big bushes, I usually wait in the bush until he almost destroys the box and then I destroy the box and maybe kill the Mortis.
---
Nothing wrong with 1 and 4
---
Im glad that it doesn't appear. 
---
I AM AT RANK 18 WITH HIM AND YES HE IS BALANCED HE IS OP JUST WITH HIS STAR POWER OTHERWISE HE IS BALANCED AND YOURE TRASH!!!!
---
His poison should have 50% healing reduction , so healer cant out heal him
---
Well, not really at that point. I'd say that's just not retaliating. Teaming is,  ideally, a truce with another person. I should've said that instead
---
Good. And how can I add a brawler name to myself?
---
So many dots................................
---
Why is Gene useless?
---
Exclusive voice packs for gems? Oh no...
---
Im so related 
---
Honestly, I haven't faced a problem with the matchmaking. *yet*
---
They are pretty situational, but many brawlers are more versatile.  I really like Mortis but it would be a lie to say he's the best in every game mode
---
Leons health is already weak enkuch. Give him a break.
---
**just wait and they'll remodel Crow and make this skin cost 150 gems**
---
Next week is my turn to repost this. üòâ
---
No it's not, see the nicknames, it's below 300
---
I think he will be great at gem grab because he can grab the gem carrier
---
At least you can say you have a mythic! And the anti dynamike one too 
---
It‚Äôs a crow skin, so really?
---
dude can you not see that it‚Äôs a replay, you can see names on replays buddy 
---
...and leon comes to you when invisible
---
I don't think that's how the level &amp; Star power system works 
---
So technically the only safe and certain way people show this 'truce' is by spinning. So just being passive and not shooting back, but purposely or coincidentally taking another brawler out should not be considered teaming since I did not spin back. We are somewhat in this 'grey area' whereby we just did not continue to shoot each other, but did not really make concrete intentions to team with each other. 
---
Got Spike yesterday from a normal brawl box lol

We know, but most of the shots didn‚Äôt look aimed by hand.

Yeah but I had fun so it‚Äôs good

Weird Flex but Okay!

Why she didn‚Äôt auto-aim is a mystery to us all
---
Did I just watch John Wick:Brawlstars?
---
That too
---
Would the bird have a hat though?
---
"SoRRy nOOb."
---
Also, I think you meant 19.6% damage increase for Leon. 20% would increase his damage to 552 per blade.
---
She looks hot
---
Ever heard ot indians? 
---
Dont shoot at close range??
---
It's an amazing picture and the OP is very talented. Can we take a moment to ask why Leon's nose is a tongue?
---
Can a leon beat a primo 1v1? Shotgunners will destroy him but I'm hesitating on primo
---
What did you say about The Crow Gang fam?
---
But then poco misses because his shots are slow
---
Stuffs it up the hole 
---
Buff no and yes nerf
---
I get it a lot. Once a month
---
And then you heal up and he hits you but your fine since he doesn't do much damage and you escape on your way, head home, spend time with wife and kids, go to bar with friends and then you come back with Frank stomping you in the ground
---
Lol this isn‚Äôt 500, if it was 500 the names would be ???
---
Don't auto aim 
---
Further u r, the more damage piper does 
---
Save ur ult for escapes 
---
She has low HP so stay back. 
---
Try her in practice first 
---
Wonderful play
---

Really great timing for self-promotion
---
"ow! the new pokemon starters look dope.
---
I didn't delete anything. Everyone loses to Leon. Not anymore though. Mortis just need 3 swiped to get close and it's over. You would not be able to escape him. Mortis can stay where he is at he's already balanced. You must be stupid.
---
What's wrong?
---
how do you have -300 gems
---
Lmao he didn't get the joke
---
If we can clap a bull, we can clap a Shelly

Excuse you. That clearly says -301
---
Yeah it seems solo and duo are quite popular but personally as they are right now i don‚Äôt enjoy them that much. I play more casually anyway so randos are good fun. Solo wins take skill congratz haha!
---
Your Colt is below 300 or the names would have been (???)
---
Haha yeah, makes sense just got out of a game where I had lvl 10s in a lvl 4 game. Nice matchmaking this terrible developer has
---
No lmao, most players there were 470-490. I just rounded up in the title to make it easier. Besides, replays are only available above 400.
---
Oh no! His name!
---
Haha
---
People dont like self promotion, just delete the comment if you don't want downvotes
---
Nice, the original idea makes the game pay2win and the superiority to players what have players lvl10 (more than have now)
---
Squawk squawk! Translation: Someone get the poison, we got a hater to kill.
---
Waw...
---
What's the point? Not so much...
---
lmao, definitely got it, but wanted to clarify.

I was playing like I was at 500 though; it was really late at night.
---
Beautifull
---
**SWEET SOUND**
---
Sure
---
Don't forget about teaming leons.
---
480. Much of a difference?
---
more importantly... why aren't u collecting boxes...
---
The same as I do with this post.
---
Yeah, most players there were ~480
---
Who the fuck are you though
---
WE GET IT LMAO
---
Uh oh, murder suicide
---
Its what makes them $$$ so makes sense
---
True!
---
lol what of this was canon and tara is shelly
---
Futuristick you god

wayyyy too unpredictable,this can change a brawler's playstyle drastically
---
Today there is a token doubler for 19 gems and it doubles 600 tokens should i get or is there going to be a cheaper one or more tokens 
---
Good job we‚Äôre typing, I can‚Äôt hear over my airpods

3,5k and still just 12 brawler :c
---
Buy it,
---
Yes 
---
YAY!Stealing art from other people without giving credit :D fun!
---
Thanks!!
---
I feel you, it‚Äôs getting stale for some reason.
---
Good idea, but enemy and friendly players should somehow be able to know witch star power a brawler has so they can make plays around that
---
Sorry
---
Petition to end petition post?
---
why?because you need the karma? sad
---
Well i have no legendary, but i have all rarities to epic and one mythic
---
Nah I‚Äôm at 6k and there‚Äôs not that many teamers. Maybe once every 5 games at most
---
I f2p with 19 brawlers, 1 legendary and 2 mythics, 7160 trophies xd

He is useful against big tanks; being able to poison tanks restricts one of their greatest strengths: grass.
---
Pushing your luck.

Crow gangggg
---
It ate my duckling ,nerf him!
---
He just explained because the if the bird died or went crazy they would know there is gas that can kill them 
---
I didn't have any mythica at the time so there wasn't any point
---
It's a replay.
---
i got spike on my first mega and tara on my second i am def not banging my head on the table
---
Lol. For sure needs to happen.

The second goal was sick teamwork but the first goal was luck af

Have you seen a better token doubler deal
---
I don't think I've ever been killed by a Leon as bull
---
Bull and Primo are good in Heist, where they that bad?
---
mortis supercell's CFO confirmed
---
Tribe (pros), Nova (pros)
---
I will continue to date the game at 1 Star in the App Store until they fix this issue. Makes the game absolutely terrible.
---
3400 trophies is too low, i get 4000 trophies in 3 weeks xd without legendary or mythical brawlers, I get spike ln 5000 trophies and 2 mythics on 6500 trophies.  I had 7160 
---
No, it's usually more expensive than this

Ok im getting it thank you for the advice

Bo and piper remodel &gt; crow remodel
---
I wrote that guy from my dsc said that this is his skin. Did I steal? No. 
---
Yeah i got the 1k for 30 gems.
---
The offer worth it
---
So the team that gets the final kill gets the extra trophies? Or If two separate teams each kill one person to eliminate the team, they both get trophies? 
---
I would love extra trophies for kills. There have been times I have been gotten so many kills and haven‚Äôt been ‚Äúrewarded‚Äù for them. 
---
Would it be better if they implemented like coin doubler rewards and other things for every 200 kills / every 10 wins or something . I play when I have 0/200 all the time and if there is no event, there is no way to progress other than trophy push. This could change that. 
---
Have much fear, Mortis is here

Should I wait for a better offer then?

---
It's a stragety..... üòÇ 
---
Sire, it is very normal 
---
Crow is fine as is. Change my mind; I'm open to discussion.
---
In my experience, crow is best used to poke at enemy brawlers and jump on one when they are low on health.
---
I find that it is best to keep the entire enemy team poisoned, rather than focus on a single enemy.
---
When in a 1v1, Crow can heal while the opponent is still taking damage from poison.
---
Crow is the 2nd longest range brawler with a spread attack.
---
Crow has the fastest base speed, giving him a lot of movement control.
---
With all this in mind and more, I believe any buff to crow should be minimal, or non-existent. Change my mind.
---
I mean it‚Äôs not that easy if they‚Äôre dead set on grabbing them like the ones I get paired with are
---
I started seeing it around 3K with 250 trophies on each brawler - I was wondering why people were spinning and letting me shoot them until I came to this subreddit.

Less skilled is not a valid reason to report tho. Less skilled often is subjective and you'd have EVERYONE reporting EVERYONE for being less skilled. And really AFK on a mobile game is pretty normal. Think of how many potential interruptions could happen while playing on your phone. Punishing people for real life stuff taking priority would be ridiculous. I will agree with griefing tho. And you can usually tell... Looking at you Brawl Ballers who run into your own goal with the ball...
---
Yes the matchmaking pool you‚Äôre put into makes a big difference. But I think what most OP really care about is the fact that you lied in the title 
---
You posted this 2 times on reddit

There is a noticeable difference, not the biggest, but noticeable. You‚Äôll see it soon if you‚Äôre not there already
---
Why do you have 56 fucking boxes unopened??? 
---
I love your sources 
---
I love you both
---
Was just thinking that myself
---
Okay, but why does it look like a tongue?  Never have seen a hoodie like that.
---
I was tilted at the time of the match. And there is definitely no difference in gameplay in 15 trophies.
---
is he pronounced gene like in bean or like in genie? not a native speaker and it annoys me so much
---
Well then you must get easy matchmaking in the 500+ pool, what‚Äôs your total trophies?
---
Just wait until you go to a museum!
---
I have 14 brawlers and while I‚Äôm excited to start unlocking the rare brawlers, I think having fewer right now is kind of an advantage. My power points are distributed among fewer brawlers so I‚Äôm able to level them more quickly. 
---
Lol I just made a mini account to help my friend regain 80 trophies. Easiest thing ever.
---
KairosTime is the best channel for advanced tips for each brawler, or if you want to see high level gameplay there are Rey, Coach Cory, Lex. Those are the most known channels even if they aren‚Äôt ‚Äúpros‚Äù
---
What qualifies you to question me?
---
It also depends on how often you play.  I started at global release and am not even at 4K trophies because I don't play very much.  However, when I do play I win almost every game.  Many players are not yet at their true trophy level.
---
Bro it might be someones friend
---
Why is there million posts with the same question and only one required?
---
Yes! Please!
---
Blue background = common. 
---
Red background = mythic. 
---
I love doing this when I‚Äôm playing with friends that are communicating, especially using Bull/Shelly
---
I do have some brawlers maxed 
---
Who is borico?
---
He os absolutely not. The fact he can take out bulls at close range, AND go invisible is too strong. His super allows for mad dukes, or just straight up destruction.
---
People can't figure out gender, can they? 
---
Who says fly like an eagle? I cant remember
---
Thats how most games work
---
We have no indication on what this means, but our decoders have ideas it will uncover universal truths 
---
Bull takes skill unless you are playing with newbs that don't know how to counterplay him or check bushes.
---
It doesn't only show our spectator but other's too
---
the guy you just killed can spectate too
---
Parfait, dans ce cas j'm'abonne direct !!!
---
Bo
---
Thanks a lot !
---
Haven‚Äôt you noticed that the daily reward system is TERRIBLE in this game? I mean I love the game but it is sad to open the game first thing in my mornings and find tedious 14 coins as my reward for logging onto the game daily. 
---
Small teams, not a small company.
---
Mortis ! so worth 
---
He‚Äôs fine as is change my mind 
---
OwO 
---
Holy shit, this is so true.
---
So relatable! üòÇ
---
True. Even though it seems that yours aren‚Äôt concurrent with one another.
---
Nice
---
WOW&gt;..
---
Lot effort meme !
---
They said it before,its not coming never,back then they decided either landscape or kill the game,cant do nothing about this ...

How is this a petition?

Woooow
---
What do you want to say with ‚ÄúStill nothing‚Äù??
---
That‚Äôs true. I used to love brawl ball. Not as fun anymore, but yeah I used to use him on brawl ball quite a bit. I haven‚Äôt used him since the update except once in a friendly (cuz he‚Äôs at 500+) but he was so strong.
---
3 or i dont team 
---
happy cake day
---
The old meta (Spike) was kind of repetitive, but at least it was a half-decent meta I guess.
---
HOLD UP
---
I think this would be a great idea but it would be to OP, perhaps if you got the choice to pick which star power you want for that round. Like you unlock all 3. but can only use one of your choice in battle, see what im saying? 
---
Frick yeah I did!

Yeah that ain't gonna happen kid.

Today I got 5 power point for a brawler that I dont even use that much -bull and I was like supercell......what is that.....im sad now
---
Ah, ik zie dat u ook een man van cultuur bent, mijn best makker
---
Except he's a legendary and skins are based off rarity.. legendary's are a 50+ gem maximum
---
one hoodie boi

I read BS as bullshit wtfff

I ' V E  G O T  A  B O N E  T O  P I C K
---
I'm going to be nice and let you know that the circle of skins is wider so it doesn't show the next ones, its because the next ones are out of shot . . . 
---
Read the update notes on Play Store or the app Store
---
You'll see he's mentioned as a mythic brawler
---
r/sbubby e r/expandong per l'ennesima volta
---
Try to see the corcle from the up you will understand that there is nothing wrong
---
First for all you are really lucky
---
Secondly, as a over 300 Leon user, some tips:
---
He is an assassin, so he can obliterate enemies easily but has low HP. 
---
Attack from distance to charge your super but to kill someone stay at medium distance. 
---
USE AUTOAIM ONLY AT CLOSE RANGE (sorry for caps)
---
In showdown open the boxes stayng near to them, Leon deals more damage the closer is to the target and boxes count too
---
Use the super to escape or to attack (if an enemy does not notice you become invisible and follow him)
---
While invisibile enemies can spot you within 4 tiles, be careful.
---
Want to escape? Hide in a bush, super and run away! The enemy will go there but you will be far.
---
Pro tip: use his super as an "enemy detector" in maps full of bushes (like Snake prare and cavern churn) you will know that are near to you but they not.
---
I feel like that strategy wouldn't work for very long
---
what
---
Ive thought of this plenty of times,
---
its a relavent and frank should see it
---
T H I S  O N E ' S  O N  T H E  H O U S E

It is a circle with five slots and you can only see three at a time
---
r/unexpectedtf2
---
Yes, this unacceptable, throw him in the dungeon!
---
Pls remove the post
---
Wow such a incredible repost
---
What's wrong with you? It's better than 7 random power points for one hero since you can choose where to invest your 14 gold in 7 power points for a brawler you care about.
---
Sop crying about this while power points are actually worse
---
Humildity is always good.
---
Then you supered your Primo to the enemy spawn /s
---
1800 health and way more damage, how does he not need a nerf?
---
Stop crying about this while power points are actually worse.
---
I think that solo Showdown should be played differently than duo Showdown. You know, the mode where the game actually pairs you up with a teammate as a built in mechanic to that specific mode. A mechanic that has been left out of Solo Showdown. A game mode that seems to be designed to measure a players individual capacity to out play other players in a free for all fight to the death. Am I getting that about right?
---
Super.call can you fix pam shelly brock pam to 1 HP
---
Yeah probably tommorow
---
Yeah tommorow
---
4. He sees his enemies in the bushes, eventough they're hiding in a bush on the other side of the map.
---
I don't get it. 
---
Yeah I'm dumb it is a replay
---
Shelly can't even reach god with her puny range, ah the glory of a noob who has no idea of what game he is playing. Go back to playing fortnite kid, a game where shotguns are actually good.
---
Yes thats what I really want to report people for teaming
---
I see you're a man of culure aswell
---
Voc√™s poderiam adicionar  um novo mapa 
---
Que poderia se chamar "Gr√©cia Antiga" bem j√° como diz o nome o mapa poderia ser em modelo da Gr√©cia antiga mas eu n√£o sei fazer montagens e etc para mostrar a voc√™s mas caso algu√©m que saiba fazer montagens e gostar da ideia, por favor fa√ßa essa montagem e mandea aqui, obviamente com os cr√©ditos meus e de quem fez, obgd tchau
---
Oh god oh no he has AirPods in!!
---
Removed - DO NOT SUBMIT POSTS WITH TITLES IN ALL CAPS. CAPS LOCK IS CRUISE CONTROL FOR COOL
---
Well, you can easily kill them because they are at 300 - 340 trophies and they suck at the game. Once you reach 700, no bulls or shellys anywhere.
---
Mate I legit bought it today. 
---
Talk about cranking it up to an 11
---
Nita buff brock buff??? This aint it chief more like crow buff üòÇüòÇ
---
They are not overused, no one is using them in the trophy range where people know they're trash. 
---
Nah you didn‚Äôt, don‚Äôt waste your time 
---
That meant to be leon and darryl nerf, just a small typo.
---
Thank you!
---
Nobody:
---
Every other one in this section: *screams in russian*
---
Supercell said its a chicken
---
This is great for diversity of the game,would love to see different people with different star power in game 
---
Not only did I win against a Bull as Tara, but look at his name.
---
It‚Äôs pretty much useless when you can get more gold out of a box a plus some powerpoints and chances to get new stuff. 
---
Sorry where is the bug?
---
Alright, they‚Äôre both TARA BULL. 
---
I bought pheonix crow today.... Its 150.... Honestly you're trying to act tuff over an argument on a Crow skin. Get a life. 
---
The kid's calling me a child when he gets triggered at common sense, types all his replies with no meaning intact and caps lock active. Don't forget to turn caps lock off kid so you don't show yourself raging during your bedtime.

That‚Äôs because everybody teams

Well, considering it's the only word you know in your vocabulary and you don't know when to use it, it's clearly evident you're the toxic guy, or kid.
---
Reply with 1 if you think hedgecutter Dan will win, reply with 2 if you think bull in a bush will win.
---
Cat is a banned word in the game I believe. That's why you can't search phonecats' clubs. He's talked about it on stream. He made his clubs before but now no one can search them because the game doesn't allow it to come up. Cat, kitten, Cubs I think are banned. Least based on what phonecats has said.
---
Crow looks like the guys from my hero academia 
---
Those freebies are already nothing so nothing's gonna change tho
---
I honestly consider you a very good brawl stars player, I forgot you can play shelly in showdown for the fact that she is trash inside it. When was shelly a thing? Gods, I see leons and Darryls at my doorstep.

Go watch kairos's video, which shows 13 pros deciding which brawler is good or not, btw darryl is the best brawler in the game, and leon is the second best. Shelly is almost the worst, being unranked in showdown, bounty, and s&amp;g.
---
First, Bo isn't in a good spot in the meta and may need even a slight buff
---
Second, you are lying. He can only have 1 super at a time, so only 3 mines. Do some research before complaining
---
The spin ruined the video 
---
Yes i will make leon

Quality shitpost

The kid's too triggered to show his true expressions. Someone call the kids hospital.
---
Nita‚Äôs face is amazing
---
Stun 
---
That's true, but you have to quickly kill him. Frank is a bad brawler but his super patches that up, much like tara.

Nah cory is better in my opinion (its just a game you dont have to be mad)

That's cool man. Was it hard to get there, or did you just play a lot?
---
Just showing where thwy would spawn, they would not all be there :)
---
Actually if replays become available for everyone, they could just make a ‚ÄúReport Replay‚Äù button. Basically it sends the replay and reason of report to Supercell and they can review it.
---
With what purpose? The chance won't get higher right?
---
Blyat

*hacking noises*

Exactly lol

lol

Thanks for the warning. I assume the next is a ticket as well?
---
I guess he felt compelled.... cornered by three pam' s mustn' t feel good
---
Ah I see that now
---
But it really do be like that so no stopping
---
Between what?
---
No. Too much people would have the same brawlers. Anyways, CR has more cards than BS has brawlers. It‚Äôs good for now.
---
Tara to Shelly ‚Äúcome with me if you want to live* That‚Äôs the Bull1000 artificial  bush over human skeleton.

Well then. That's a load of bull.

Literally right after seeing this post I opened a brawl box and got 5 Mortis, 6 Colt, and only 14 coins

This. This is what people don't understand. Teaming is by no means a no-skill strategy, instead, it's a strategy that focuses less on pure skill and more on psychology. Read your teammate(s)'s movements. If they keep trying to approach you, they're trying to kill you. Know who to and not to team with. Know when and where you can trust your teammates. Understand that your teammates care more about getting a higher place themselves than getting a higher placement as a team. There's so many intricacies of teaming that so many people are overlooking. It's not a no-skill strategy by any means. If anything, it may even be considered more skill in some circumstances.
---
Still, fuck big teams. I'm an advocate of teams of 2-3, but the 9 man thrower teams are ridiculous. I remember originally getting Dynamike to 500 in Skull Creek and Stormy as my first 500, and every game would go approximately like this: the first 4-5 throwers to go to mid would get into a team. The remaining throwers on the outsides would either group up and form their own little team, or just get picked off by the big team in the middle. Then, after everyone except the one team dies, it'll usually split into 2 more teams, usually split Dynamikes vs Barleys, but sometimes it's just whoever is where at that point. Though it seemed like there were two distinct teams, there was 0 loyalty whatsoever. If a single Mortis showed up in front of a team of 5 Dynamikes, they would all try to kill each other or escape by any means necessary. It was still a lot of strategy, but much less fair of one. Especially since Mortis was so unviable back then, what with its movement speed being the same as the shooters.
---
That‚Äôs some justice for using OP brawler

Yeah, that's why I it should be able to be turned off. Rip.  :P

Not at all, you can still use it for new character unlocks

I got leon from one yesterday!

Oh he's there

Thank you OwO121212121221q, now I am free to roam this earth.
---
I won so many games due to having his star power... split second was a great map for him
---
Except he actually is keep looking
---
That Bull was so dumb... All he needed was one regular attack and that was all.
---
But of course, for a Pro like him, he needed to finish with his Super...
