What about *THE BRAWLER*

i like this map. i can easily push short range brawlers to 500 and its nice cuz i am too noob and cant do it in any other mode lol

The range wasn‚Äôt a bug they just fixed the animation because the actual range wasn‚Äôt showing

Surprisingly enough, I‚Äôm not actually joking. The entire time I was using my super i was hovering it above myself. This was for a couple reasons: 1, sometimes when in cqc especially with a mortis, getting the quick super right on your feet can be difficult, and the autoaim just doesn‚Äôt go to the right place. 2, this was kind of a  psychological play because they probably assume I‚Äôm aiming at them, so especially the mortis would rush me, only to be met with a rocket-y doom (somewhat what happened). So there ya have a semi-pro tip from a ‚Äúboomer‚Äù OG that might be stuck in his ways and totally unqualified.
---
Looks pretty cool was it like clash royale?
---
That is the biggest issue I have with Brawl Stars. I almost never lag in CR when using my home WiFi but Brawl Stars has days where 1 in 3 showdowns lag. Still think it is the other players lagging that is causing the server to lag everyone in showdown because 3 vs 3 modes lag a lot less often.

Hello internet, welcome to game theory. So, you know Darryl, right? He's one of the three brawlers in the game that doesn't have a voice. Now, when you think about it, he doesn't exactly make the most sense out of this trio. Let's see, we have a living cactus that communicates entirely through exaggerated facial expressions, yeah, that checks out. Next, we have a 10 year old tribal ninja over here that is extremely stealthy. Also checks out. And then, we have Darryl. He's a robot pirate. Doesn't exactly check out. Another thing to consider is that it seems apparently rather easy for Supercell to make voices for robotic characters; Carl got his extremely quickly while Tick and 8-Bit got theirs on release! Glad to see new brawlers joining the roster don't seem so shy anymore. So, all of this points towards one question; WHY DOESN'T DARRYL HAVE A VOICE? Well, perhaps it's because giving him the gift of speech would reveal one of Darryl's deepest, darkest secrets... and I think I know exactly what that secret is. You see, I believe that Darryl may actually not be his real identity, that he's actually a character that was born long before Brawl Stars even was a concept. Who is this character, you may ask? Well, he's been floating around meme culture for a very long time, and he has a very famous voice. This voice would reveal Darryl's true identity if he ever spoke. That's right, I'm saying that Darryl......... is Sans.
---
Picocofrocortis is the best one XD
---
Right. What I see as unfair is that when we have 3 guys power 6 max and we play 3 10s, there is a distinct disadvantage. They should balance the matchmaking for premade teams. It seems like power does in fact have an influence because if it were just trophies that would be fine. But it‚Äôs both.
---
Nothing because my Shelly was underranked
---
People: Wow cool one!   
---
Supercell: Got it, Rosa needs a nerf and brock needs a rework!
---
Its a good idea for sure but it would be hell to play on it.
---
Except for the snipers and throwers. They will love this map

Looking at this just gives me pain and makes me sadden like el primo's losing pose without crying. I try so hard, try some stuff, yet i get nothing. Nothing whatsoever. I slept and had a best dream about getting crow and buying gold mecha crow but then when i woke up i became sadder. There is just no hope for me to get these legendaries. Every 2k players unlock legendaries and complain but they do not know the pain of high trophy players. Just seeing people unlock legendaries just makes me feel like im being taunted at and laughed at.

Agreed. But power 10 is still a factor. I wouldn't mind power 3 to play against power 9, but playing a 10 gives a distinct advantage. Their characters have an additional ability. I have been able to beat few with 3 low power levels and 3 tens, but imagine a fair matchmaking where skill actually does get matched up. Then the other team has power 10s? Equal skill then loses because of the 10 advantage.

Ficou animal cara!! Parab√©ns pelo trabalho

YEAH, Frank is quite bad. :D The last 50 trophies were really hard. Thanks.
---
Wow so it is 30 gems?! It is really cheap bro!
---
The problem with that is it makes more work for the team. It means they have to remodel the original brawler as well as the skins they have

I kinda agree with him because you can have 5000 health while in battle with her and she uses her super and you are dead

I actually got leon at 1000 trophies on my second account but i already have leon on my main account so i gave the account to some random guy in my club that didn't have a legendary.

And also i tricked an 11 year old into giving me his crow account this way, but i returned the account and told him not to share personal info online

BROCK IS OP!

I think you domt know how every stat worka... When you upgrade a brawler, every stat gets +5%,so if any brawler does 1000ndamage in level one, he is going to deal 1050 damage per hit, and when you max a brawler, he becomes 40% better at all, for example Gene-he does 1000 damage with normal attack on level 1,but on level 9(we Don't include the star powers) he is going to deal 1400 damage.

Then how did you get 6 items?

Objection! Mortis didnt had voicelines in his old model, meaning nobody would have known he was a creature of the night.

I do this if my teammate noob mortis becuz 2 on 3 make that battle unwinnable.

True. I guess it gets hard when you have 500 trophy level people and trying to matchmake. Prior to 500 premades were never a real problem becuase mostly those power 10s are already in the 500s. Problem is when you play 500s premade and you are average players (maybe with a decent composition) that are thrown up against 3 skilled players (maybe or maybe not good composition).
---
I've never seen it not be a Mortis...

Tim royal doesn't even do effort. He just puts no edits except a random voiceline or game music (not even a cool song, just the battle themes.) More stuff: bad grammar, just puts a random choice in his "lucky or pro" videos, clickbait, mass ads, and yeah.

Though it is wholesome, it‚Äôs not right. You should be playing duo showdown in that case.
---
Seniors is 40+ oof
---
Are you asking for fucking karma
---
Yeah I had the same question...
---
But you didn‚Äôt say yes or no
---
40 years old is not a senior...
---
I'm at 18k and I'm smart enough (unlike a certain imbecile) to not make a strawman argument. Highlight where I wrote that her super isn't OP? I wrote that she isn't OP, and if you don't understand the difference, then you should be playing less games and stay in school.
---
&gt; How many trophies are you? You‚Äôre probably just a Shelly main  
---
Says the idiot that think Shelly's super is OP. That's exactly what goes on in every stupid Shelly main's mind. It only takes 621 trophies on every brawler to reach 18k, which doesn't even require a 50% win rate. That's probably your crowning achievement so I'll prefer not to burst your bubble.

Since when are 40 y/os seniors

how do you make the eyes perfectly

I always wanted Darryl to have a star power called rolling thunder and it would strike lightning around him as he rolled dealing damage to enemies who weren‚Äôt hit but nearby.

Thank you so much :)

Thank you :D

How many trophies do you have? Also I think somebody stole this from you but idk. Good video btwüòÅ.

Barley. The control and dps make him a very versatile and fun brawler, as well as the voice lines.

I like Barley as well. Though he has a lot of skins, most of them are really good(Excluding maybe RWB)

First of all Pam doesn't even need a fucking remodel, like what's wrong with her model?

People abuse it in every game that has this function but that doesn't mean that the function should not exist it simply means that you need a good algorithm that punishes the abuser and punishes the report

And going beyond a support with people in case there is an error would be indispensable
