Oh, well back then it was extremely devastating on the offense or defense lol not surprised it was nerfed 
---
---
---
Don't take it personally. If you don't like it, then so be it;  I can't force you to like it.
---

---
Btw, I'm old enough to use a phone, if that answers your question.
---
Can you tell me how to get this
---
Out of all brawlers who got model change your going on about colt, the most polished of the lot, why not go on about rico
---
So only youtubers get test acc?
---
It's happening to some other people, i think it'll be fixed soon
---
It destroyed in the whole circle, now it’s only in the center lol
---
\^ this
---
That’s weird cause I can’t view anyone else’s but the people over 400 
---
No but It looks fire
---
That is nerfing for ya
---
Do u know if these skins will be discounted like with the Christmas skins and the recent dynamike and skins. If so do you know for how much they will be discounted
---
30 gems is cheap though, you can get that easily from opening your boxes.

He's going to get a remodel. Like every other re-model, he will be fixed, polished and get more details.

Look up some og videos of her, it was devastating

I don't care about rico , just Cold my best one

I care

It’s like 1 in 450 so, in 450 boxes?
---
kinda unlucky u didn't get loaded rico...
---
It has the greatest impact on a match so it had to be nerfed
---
I am definitely buying the 80 gem default one

Nerf gene 20

I agree with you friend 
---
I played since beta launch, didn’t get one till a month ago
---
Amazing, yet again! Could you make Poco by any chance?
---
You should call him ricochet
---
happening to me as well...
---
every 4-5 matches the game crashes and I need to restart  
---
and pray I´m not dead by the time I´m back.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Hasn´t happened once before the update
---
No, not only YouTubers. Still game developers, moderator Reddit, BrawlStats.com developer and other close people
---
y u do this to life leech
---
by far the best mode
---
Heh
---
and i bought it for 30 two days ago lol
---
This
---
I’m still getting it even at full price
---
Is it Buff crow?
---
 
---
I'll make it some day.
---
Gives me a reason to actually play
---
Someone has already done this!? Damn
---
what if you have that brawlers attack and super too but it last for a limited time.
---
dang i would pretend it was a lawnmower back then
---
If you make him smile, I will think it is sans again...
---
I’m 20 and I wanna buy one bczI never had one and it looks fun 
---
Yeah, something weird this time. It stops the game completely. Typical lag stutters your movement. This is different. It happens once in a while and the whole game is frozen for a few seconds (although I haven't crashed yet).
---
:) that’s good! Do you know who you are going to make next?
---
Thanks for making it

Yeah
---
We just need a construction frank skin
---
tried it like 5 times already still the same 
---
what device are you playing with
---
I can play my this game for an hour before I get bored then wait half an hour then I can play again
---
Eat a borger
---
Try opening the game from the app store and wait a few seconds
---
False.  The majority of people don’t hide and will all usually die before you succumb to the poison guaranteeing a positive trophy placement even at the highest trophy levels, you would just hide and take long range pot shots occasionally for health. Like I said I’ve pushed brawlers to 700 doing this in little time, it was an easy mode to cheese for cups if you knew what to do and I imagine that’s why it was removed.  Not sure why people who don’t even know about this and have been playing the game a month feel the need to argue 
---
No problem, glad you appreciate my hard work on developing brawler stars. /s

He’s trolling just ignore him 
---
Dawg, he still does a rediculous amount of damage and has insane movement speed, he doesn't seem balanced
---
Clay started recently, so I don't know.
---
I don't think he opens them, rather enables Brawler to be in the game. Idk how to make it happen tho, if I edit something the app just crashes, even if it's one letter.
---
I feel like the game just starts matching you against higher levels when you're on a win streak
---
Damn that’s tuff
---
not sure, but official Lunar new years begins on Feb 5th.

"Brawl Stars support has donated a new Brawler to you."

Don't tell me the YouTubers are going to get Gene early... -.-

Oh really lol but I don’t thk I have any lose streak with this ac. (Not my main ac

No, it's dry and then it gets plump.

He is also my favourite Brawler and i to think his redesign is nice

I know. That why it needs to be changed.
---
Congrats bro, you played with a youtuber lol
---
This is very good, it just feels weird seeing Piper's legs.
---
I think 8 seconds is good but I agree with range nerf
---
:)
---
What was before the update?
---
I could be wrong but I think the shots are blue because it's supposed to match your team color. So let's play you're playing a co-op gamemode then your projectiles and teammate projectiles will be blue while the enemy's will be red.
---
I dont want the original
---
Lol i remember when everyone’s range was outrageous
---
Im having shot delay, and i want to die.
---
Or just a wider goal.
---
Tips:
---
#Why? 
---
Ok, I know it sounds dumb, but Mortis now isn’t that bad in Heist. With the walls being removed on many heist maps, tanks have become less prevalent. With this and the many throwers and squishies in Heist, Mortis could actually be good.
---
This isn’t the only game. I’ve played about 20 games and have around a 60% winrate.
---
Now for the tips
---
#Main goals:
---
Overall, there are some main goals for Mortis you should always be trying to do:
---
Dodge any tanks, focus throwers when possible, distract or threaten squishies, and play defensive.
---
MORTIS IS NOT A SAFE FOCUSER.  Mortis is entirely a pick hero and just that. His dps is too small for him to be useful against a safe.
---
#Play defensive
---
Mortis is not meant for attacking the safe. Instead, deal with any enemies that are trying to leak through your defense and pick off retreating brawlers.
---
#The safe:
---
Of course, you will eventually make it to the safe with your team. When you do this, you can do two strategies. You can:
---
A. If the enemy team is hard defending, try to hide behind walls and soak up fire.
---
B. If there is only one dps or two dps you are good against, try to use the primo tactic of hitting the safe and enemy. Try to save your charges for hitting the save and people unless you just need to dump dps on to the safe.
---
#Tanks
---
Tanks are simple; dodge them unless you can take them out efficiently, and overall try to bait the enemy tank into lanes where your teammates could shoot them.
---
#TeamComps
---
The best working strategy for me so far is double dps+ Mortis. Mortis mainly takes the place of a tank or a third dps. Some good comps are ones like Brock Rico Mortis or Barley Rico/Brock Mortis.
---
But for real, he’s not the best thing since sliced bread.
---
They probably removed them for people who didn’t buy them to make space
---
So if he gets no penaltey then that means..
---
But it's supposed to be solo...
---
Thanks for the reply tho

They said they were gonna test within a small playerbase to see how the system handles replays. They will then lower it down more and more until everyone has access. They just are testing to see how it holds up, it’s not excessive because they even state that players above 10k account for a slim percent of the playerbase.

I’m level 113 and I still get that

Can we have a change where we can organize our brawlers from highest trophy’s to lowest amount? 🤷‍♂️ Would just like to see more ways to organize our brawlers. 
---
Are you kidding?!
---
no, just no.
---
Is it me, or have I been experiencing lag more often and before. And honestly, did Leon get the nerf we all deserved?
---
I understand your point, it's just that we are in a tank meta currently and I think that if we want more diversity in this meta we might need to change it up for map "themes." 
---
Exactly... this is why brawl stars needs to add it...

the ball consuming ammo will still be here right?

Just bought the level 50 pack FeelsBadMan

I would bet a lot of money that they looked at games played in their data and saw it was underperforming compared to the others.
---
I agree, it was my favorite mode. Great way to punish campers, you had to be dealing damage to stay alive.
---
Have fear Mortis is here
---
Thank You.. Really do appreciate it

We can only fight by drawing attention to the problem. Unfortunately, unlike music and stuff, I don't think a judge will let you sue someone for stealing a meme.
---
Damn man
---
Map is really good I just think ther need to be a little rework on spawns but it’s really nice
---
From what I understood, you collect gems from the middle by destroying power boxes.
---
After 5ish seconds of holding the gems it is transferred into making the robot. Once you have 5 gems stored your robot activated and tries to destroy their cannon 
---
The cannons act like safes where when you destroy them you win the game. They also do a lot of damage which is why the robot is best for attacking it while you back it up. 
---
Correct me for any misconceptions or stuff I left out

Same here... Come on!!!! LOST ALOT OF CUPS BECAUSE THIS

Sorry for my english, it is not my native language

Ok, it you're always looking at data you *must* have noticed showdown crashing more often for some of the playerbase? It's literally unplayable for me while the other modes are ok.
---
We need the upcotes here people(u got mine)
---
Yeah I guess that's the only explanation 
---
**CYBERCHASE WE'RE MOVING**
---
1. Yeah, they really need to revert the goal changes. Camping behind the goal is the lesser evil. It’s so hard to get goals in Brawl Ball now that it makes the game less about ball handling and SKILL. And a LOT more about raw damage. You basically must carry Frank to score reliably, and he was already good, but I find it near impossible to score without the all team stun, or several team wipes. Several. It seems often times beneficial to die so you can essentially teleport to the goal to defend with invulnerability. Revert this change. Please, it ruins the mode, the mode is so hilariously boring and yes most games end in draws.
---
2. I’m conflicted about passes consuming ammo. Maybe passes should consume 1 half of an ammo slot. I mean I wouldn’t suggest that having passes cost something is a bad mechanic. It does take away from the amount of ball handling you can perform. It isn’t only a nerf to Mortis. I would trade Mortis’s buff for the original system any day. It’s a nerf to the speed and fluidity of the game mode. You can’t dribble really at all. Passing now is just &lt;for&gt; passing. I really hope they amend this change or come up with a new system. As much as I admire Mortis’s damage buff. I would rather have Mortis deleted from the game then go another mode rotation with Brawl Ball as it is. Best game mode, RUINED. What a terrible balance decision.

I have a Colt with almost 400 trophies. My opponents and teammates from 400-500. Is that okay? 
---
No. They don't come back 
---
Yes
---
This happened at least 10 times to me. I’m sure many others have also experienced it
---
I totally agree. It was way better than game modes like meteor and potion, where luck comes heavily into play. If someone gets potion, and you just happen to be near them, you’re basically dead. As for healing mushrooms, everybody just survives until the ring closes in, then it’s complete chaos. Life leech is the actual mode where strategy and fairness are here.
---
Actually in his firing animation you can see that right when you shoot there’s a tiny little balls of color that are around his guns. So the color is actually just being lost from the projection. You’d have to take a video and pause it to see tho
---
Make it to where each of the island brifges at the top bottom left and right have two other points of entry so a weak brawler doesnt get cornered. Like for example on the bottom and top two seperate branches would go the left and right for a total of 3 entrances to the island
---
I would say wait for Robo Rumble to spend your tickets. Seems to be the best use of gems (buying tickets) if you can do well in it. [gem spending](https://brawlstarsup.com/spend-gems/) this has some info on tickets and stuff

Darryl and Spike look the same.... Change my mundo

Ps. I am not taking into account their attack animation
---
Need to hit the shots tho...and if OP could do that the poco would just die.
---
Those 30 gems quintupled in value. Early investment in richochet paid off.
---
The fact that it is Mythic is guessed by most people, although confirmation is nice. But the rest of the info can be seen in the Brawl Talk video. And Support is pretty much not part of Supercell
---
Haha no you are not
---
No, me too brother.
---
Layman’s opinion that probably means nothing. I think the only actual issue is the spawning change, dribbling with Mortis was OP.
---
“Creative” fixes that I imagine probably involve new coding that is too difficult to be worth it.
---
1. Split map into 3 equal zones (A team’s third, B team’s third, mid field 3rd.) death in the zone near your goal is 1.5x spawn timer, death in enemy’s zone is .75x spawn timer, mid zone is normal.
---
2. Brawlers can’t block shots while invincible from respawn or when just outside of goal (like a reverse goalie box, would need to be clearly marked, maybe 1 or 2 boxes forward from edge)
---
3. Go back to the old layout but make it so the ball cant go past the back line of the goal.
---
“Easier” fixes that seem to have code that is already in game and easier to manipulate.
---
1. Spawn in corners of map (roughly the same amount of time to defend as it took to get around the goal before)
---
2. Increase spawn timers 1.25-1.5x across the board for better advantages on kills. (Team wipes matter more)
---
3. Add poison gas in goal up to the boxes. (Brawlers have enough time invincible to get out, and can’t dance inside and out of the goal blocking shots. Have to dodge to left and right instead, opening up
---
Shots.)
---
But it's boring and makes actually playing pointless
---
They all look stunning , wow great skills
---
Lol SuperCell wouldn't allow it
---
Dude, brilliant 👏👏 I haven't though of that I'ma go change it, thanks for the comment! :)

Why buy the original?

No problem man good map
---
Yup its definitely supercell fault my friend with samsung s8+ have this problem too
---
I really hate it
---
Oh, thanks for letting me know.
---
Or makr the goal 2 tiles deeper maybe 
---
Just save if you want to keep it dont steal his stuff
---
Layman’s opinion that probably means nothing. I think the only actual issue is the spawning change, (granted I don’t play Mortis, so I’m not feeling the nerf as hard as others)
---

I'm new to this game. Is poco lucky too? I got him the first day.
---
Also congratz
---
There's a guy in my clan with every brawler and every star power ans he's only at 3500.
---
I think poco is one of the first everyone gets, but he's really good
---
Not balance. Barley And Dinamike Will be strong on the spawn
---
There are only 8 spawn points lol
---
He's really good at getting Rank 2 or 3 in Showdown. Just hide
---
Reality is often disappointing. 
---
Where do I sign the petition?
---
Actually, I's working with stock ROM (I tried with 5.0 lollipop, I will do further testing).  
---
I tried with two custom ROMs (Lineage and GA) and crashes on start like in video above.  
---
Pre-release versions work with custom roms. I suppose they have implemented a kind of check about root or something (custom kernel issues?), I'll try to find a way to get this game working without having all the  stock Asus bloatware and let you know :)  
---
Next steps: Will test with MM, then with unlocked bootloader, then with Borets CleanStock probably
---
Me and my bro both got leon. We are both under 3k trophies and 3.5k combined
---
Literally me at 4,5,6,7,8k
---
Wait what? You don’t have replays under 400????
---
Nope
---
Sakura spike has a HUGE attack change and he cost only 80 gems so that consideration is false, but I do think it's a bit weird for all the lunar skins to be priced the same
---
I loved the old animation. The way he walks is cunning
---
It still annoys me that Barley is in a purple box but isn't an epic
---
oh gee really??? its not like everyone knows that already cuz of the brawl talk that everyone watched psssh why would they?

aww thank you &lt;3 &lt;3

Absolutely not. IMO at least one skin for each event should never return to the game. This will make player feel OG and I love to be one of them.
---
Just you!
---
Lmao
---
Nice job 
---
Haters gonna come in and say 'oh you play with asians who are not as strong as the OG players because you can never get a chance to match with them' 
---
The skin is awesome!
---
Yeah it is very difficult to pickup, and duo showdown in life leach is literally unplayable. Its also very tilting. Over 300 trophies you take one piper/brock/spike shot and its game over. People will just stay behind a wall and you wont get any health back. Generally taking one shot from anyone else is like a 50/50 of gg. You cant come back in life leach
---
&gt;It's about when you do it
---
No, that's not what strategy is. Strategy is your plan of action. It's how you're planning on winning. This is big in both games.
---
In brawl stars you and your teammates basically have to decide what play is best for completing the objective. It could be using a tank to distract the enemy while the damage dealers take them out.
---
In clash royale it's pretty much how you will play your deck to win against your opponent. Maybe you have a cycle deck so your strategy is to outcycle your opponent so that they cant counter your main win condition.
---
Skill is just how well you can execute your strategy.
---
In Brawl stars this consists of good aiming, your reaction time, and how good your movement is. Also knowing when to pick battles.
---
In clash royale you have to take into account more factors, such as the amount of elixir of both you and your opponent, both yours and your opponents current hand/cycles. Then you have to pick which cards to place, where to place them, and when. And you have to have quick reactions.
---
So I take back what I said before. Clash royale and brawl stars require similar amount of skill but clash royale also requires more strategy.
---
Basically, if you never played either game before and picked them both up, it would take much longer for you to get good at clash royale than brawl stars.
---
Bull?
---
Isn't it difficult to draw from that angle and get the drawing proportional, not like vertically stretched?
---
He has a football shirt?
---
Cutie
---
Yes please
---
who cares?
---
Same here, i need him in my life.
---
omai gosh i tot u got spike
---
This is such a cool idea. Count me in.
---
More like Crow vs. Frank actually
---
Nah
---
free box...
---
If it work your friend is the best
---
I wish i could live there 
---
Incredible
---
that channel has 29k subs. good luck with that
---
Good idea
---
I'd love to see colt next pls especially with the remodel 
---
I would love to have on of these on my desk, awesome job! 
---
Go with the Huwaei P20 Pro and you will never look back
---
No that would be p2w 
---
Thanks, make sense.
---
4'3k and missing 7 characters, including Penny and Ricochet
---
Buy a new one for him.
---
ADD IT NOWWWWW
---
lucky, im level 121 with a 0.173% without legendary 0/3
---
Thank you for your compliment.
---
*Please don't kill me because of my opinion, on this first part, but...*
---
I like the mechanic of consuming ammo to kick the ball, it takes out Mortis out of Brawl Ball and that makes it possible to buff him in other areas, although i miss playing him in BB, i think this change was for the better. And this not only affect him, if affects other unusual ball carriers, like Bull, which is good.
---
Now, spawning inside the goal is the problem. For that to be a reality, when you die, you should take *AT LEAST* 5 or 6 seconds to respawn, because 3 seconds is just bs. When basicaly get rewarded whem you die. Right now, if you want to score a goal, you cannot kill anyone, you have to drible the entire team (and that is only possible with Darryl these days) or you gotta kill the entire enemy team at the same time in front of their net. This is the only way.
---
Supercell, if you are reading this, please, don't wait two months untill the next update to fix this. It is very simple to solve this problem, you just gotta increase the respawn time from 3 seconds to 5 or 6 seconds. Again, please, take some time and prioritose fixing this, Brawl Ball is simply not enjoyable now because of the changes. 
---
ye
---
What means? Autoaim?
---
Elprimo x gene
---
Thanks for the feedback 👋🏻 
---
Nop his voice is the best of the game
---
It just wasnt really fun at all. It only limited your playstyle and brawler choice
---
tbh yes
---
Not  true..  it is very hard to go agaisnt leon with him. You need to have a lot space to do the "hit and run" tatic
---
It's cheap.
---
I just realised there’s a location button lol
---
And do we know how much does it lower it?   
---
Cuz a legendary is hard to get and maybe I should open all boxes befor it, cuz my legendary % is at 0,11....
---
https://link.brawlstars.com/invite/friend/en?tag=2029Y9JY&amp;token=wygmxj2y
---
I feel like gene is being overrated. He has a slow reload, like snipers, but shorter rang. Not sure about him.
---
wow!
---
Wtf
---
If you strike me down, ~~I~~My friend shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine.
---
Brawl Stars best game of Supercell. No doubt
---
No don't know, but legendary reduce luck more than other rarity. Anyway 0,11 is not that much.
---
Are you fucking stupid. That’s not even basic econ. Basic econ is supply and demand. If one person buys a pineapple at $100 a pineapple is not now worth $100..do you see your logic. You’re bringing relativity to yourself and not the majority of consumer, which is why you’re wrong. It’s fucking hilarious you’re trying to checkmate me like that, I’m a finance major you fuck. You clearly don’t know shit about econ and the fact that you’re misrepresenting the basics is proof of that. Gtfo and play at your pathetic 3k trophies or whatever you’re at
---
Been playing since global and got crow a few days ago
---
Removed - DO NOT SUBMIT POSTS WITH TITLES IN ALL CAPS. CAPS LOCK IS CRUISE CONTROL FOR COOL
---
He is the worst legendary... he is fun to play once you got how to play him right but.. he is not very good.... there is no reason to play him in a point o view of best brawlers for each mode/map... there are too many best options than him in every mode....  maybe he is a good option on dual showdown. But even them you have better options
---
3 month work at minimum.... :D It's much for me.
---
EXACTLY
---
You see those black things near to its head?
---
That outplay was insane, but why did they chase you when they were clearly winning and they had the advantage? 
---
You probably have a mythic than?
---
He still isn't that good though 
---
the throw arc will be a rainbow? maybe its better if he throw pockets like Penny
---
And macthmaking? Are you planning to fix it? 1 year of this game and still have a macthmaking worse that any Call of Duty hahaha. Come on, is a 3v3, do it better. Im just tired of fighting with 10 strong Brawlers and with 200 more trophies than me.
---
Thank you
---
I started playing in April and got Spike in July
---
I have the same percentage but I have to find the two mythic too.. are 2 months that I don't find anything
---
They removed daily brawl boxes? ;-;
---
We still need to be grateful for what we get
---
Note: The Gems and Penny's cannon are probably only placeholder assets.
---
The Gems are supposed to be bolts, but, it's a test, so, they didn't create own assets for the mode yet.
---
This is a  masterpiece.
---
I never spent money on the game
---
Nice thoughts. LOL. Just stop raging. I mean Supercell did do this to NERF MORTIS. It was way too op. I was winning every single game with Mortis. When I got the ball I just passed it in front of me and rushed with mortis which took two ammo. I agree that its annoying when you team wipe and you can't get to the goal but if one of the opponent's team gets the ball outside the goal and go in by mistake its your goal. Think about it!
---
I need this on my desk while I make Brawl Stars videos lol 😂
---
If not for replays, we wouldn’t be able to see epic clips like this happen. I’m sure during the no replays era, thousands of epic plays have vanished into non existence and they remain only in the minds of those who have made them. 
---
He can do that without spamming auto-aim
---
wtf my crow at lvl. 2 had more trophys than yours
---
Thank you, that would be awesome! I love that I get a comment like this every time I post a brawler concept :)
---
Thats what i call being constructive!
---
Good idea, i like it a lot, maybe just slightly smaller icon, but I would like if this was implemented
---
Thats the real question
---
(1) we know. We’ve known for weeks.
---
(2) this isn’t even that bad. Stop complaining for karma.
---
-are you gatekeeping maining-
---
Lol I got the night just after the update
---
wtf he's still bad
---
I got crow I meant
---
Thats how mafia works
---
Not quite as bad tho cos that wall can be destroyed. 
---
its still not fair tho
---
Wow... you did that, in a couple of hours? Really impressive! He looks badass!
---
Also i have every character but the mythics and legendaries, most of which i got from the 100 boxes, and im confused on how im gonna exist
---
Rico: Delete that shit right now
---
I have 0legendary and 0mythics
---
When the game is out I played with it
---
Why it's Unfair? It'll take  time to come. You don't want the game and servers to Lag right??
---
Also imo SC will release it for all players very soon so have some patience
---
That would make me salty
---
Because they both risked dying which is what happened????
---
That would be awesome! I always figured Bo was somehow related to Nita, so it might be cool to see the three of them on a team in the other modes :)
---
Needs more barriers!  Too easy to score as it is now.
---
What’s wrong, senpai? Finally notice me.
---
Was that a jojos reference
---
It has too many meanings Lmfao😂🔥
---
So ?
---
It’s a super low effort post. You just spliced two images together. Who cares. 
---
let the man keep his boxes 😤😤 
---
Thanks. :)
---
what about the other languages?
---
Supercell is too confident to think teaming will fade off. Teaming will increase even More. Good job with the meme btw😂🔥
---
korean colt skin!!!
---
That's called timing not skill. Skill is something you are good at and have an advantage over the others. A 500 trophy Colt is gonna have way more skill than a 100 trophy Colt so he is gonna have an advantage to him. Going in the smoke is not a skill you can get good at, but leading your shots with Colt and hearing every single bullet is skill and will take practice, AND grant an advantage over the others.
---
i like the idea of 2 attack modes, and the stun would be fun to set up a gene hook or an attack
---
It looks nice, but i dont think supercell would make anything with too similar models yet, and also that basic is way too strong with the stun. You would have to make it very weak, and have a very high recharge rate, otherwise some players would be stunned and incapable of moving for so long. Also, think of the Frank supers.....
---
are you insane? of course you need to be a 9 year old OR a 14 year old, if ur older or younger its not ok  🗿
---
Fire is extinguished, you need more gems.
---
Wow
---
That's insane!
---
The Frank should have +7 trophies
---
How was leon visible 
---
Right 
---
this isnt your art...
---
Oops it was a replay sorry
---
I would say make the normal attack the lightning with no stun and the star power a .25-.50 second stun. The way you have it is a little overpowered
---
These are all phenomenal. Thank you so much for sharing them. 
---
Nah, it's fine! 
---
Lol that frank auto-aiming. Should have placed in second....
---
Why tf would they chase him into the storm
---
what the fuck do you want credit for? for putting a picture of a robot candy machine and a toy next to each other? sorry i dont undertand why you are concerned
---
I did that with barleys lmao
---
It is my art 
---
His username is BBY and the artwork is signed as BBYG tho...
---
i hard reset my phone and it worked! thx for trying to help :D
---
thats great to hear have fun man!
---

I’m dying😂😂😂😂
---
thx☺️
---
This isn't overwatch
---
i saw this post like an hour ago though?
---
Why is Barley's eye pants? 
---
A glowing tile on screen is not space on their server. It's just a simple yes/no message between the clients and servers. 
---
&amp; why are their servers being crammed more now than previously? Have I missed something
---
Fair enough, I figured since the radius for the attack is small compared to other throwers, he needed something extra to make his basic comparable.  Even with a slow reload speed, walk speed, and rate of fire, still too OP?
---
Oh wow that’s pretty lucky! I usually get 3.
---
Dang that’s lucky!
---
darryl is so good
---
No Luck
---
Wow your amazing outstanding move

This bug is already known
---
I find the stats and attack concepts pretty viable but would prefer the brawler to not look even close to Nita.
---
Amazing work though. 
---
I see what ur talking about now I think this is a repost nvm 
---
Later this update i kill 2 bulls in SD, easy.
---
The reason probably is barley
---
I agree that most players would want that but mortis is nowhere near being good in all game modes currently 
---
Repost. 
---
Its brigitte from ow bois
---
Rally to me!

This looks great

He'll be able to join after 24. Make sure you are online when he Joins and let your fellow Club staff knows that your friends is joining.:)
---
I just want Mortis! Why can´t i have him?
---
Thank you friend (:
---
Hm it’s always hard when you’re 1 against 2. I think a key feature would be to not encourage teaming. F.ex maps where you start close to someone, and where there are multiple boxes close to you both, gives more incentive to form an alliance.
---
Only teammates can see this 
---
Beautiful
---
I have the high ground! 
---
I hate teaming.
---
I think i saw one but i'm not sure

So basically if you are in the position that there is a risk to auto-aim wrong target just start to aim, or avoid those positioning. 
---
It's so simple. You need to see the advantage of using whatever you use and use what bring you more profits. 
---
Now people that fight can use your lack of skill to take advantage by putting turret, bear in the close fight or simply just fight close to the box. 
---
If want to use auto-aim use it. But at least try to use it smartly.

Too funny 😁

For real the best brawl ball was before global where people spawned beside the goal which is not as easy to defend and u don't need ammo to kick why must they fuck with brawl ball when it was perfect... They fucking made a space behind the goal and we spawned there fucking dumb devs
---
Brawl AF!
---
Its not broken, learn how to play
---
dr lupo
---
I like getting a new brawler that a free 300+ trophies 
---
I agree, before the latest update games would be interesting and most games were really tight, now the ties are just too much, I don't think spawning brawlers inside the goal was a good idea 
---
The stun is OP
---
I think the orange part is too big 🤔
---
I agree with you, but I find the Mortis flair ironic. it’d be like a Pam complaining about losing leech life 😂
---
No brock?
---
We need this when opening a chest. I open so many on accident.
---
Don't feed the troll.
---
Mortis got a nerf in brawl ball and the star power change was also a nerf. Before I would use it to engage with 6000 ho but now I need to actually secure a kill to stay alive, and also my teammates stealing kills shuts down my star power. 
---
Oh just wait, is get better at 500 thropies with Leons, Spikes and Crows
---
My case is I lag a lot after playing few matches :'(
---
like everything should be.
---
SC is telling you that you need to play more gem grab and bounty :)
---
Just need longer respawn. That’s all. 
---
Actually they recently limited the movements to I think 16 different directions to help with specifically that. You can test this in brawl ball with how janky the ball moves when you turn your character. 
---
Even with low health, slow rate of fire, slow reload speed, and slow walk speed?
---
It's quite aggressive 
---
&gt;”ridiculous English”
---
&gt;knows how to properly pronounce transition and ridiculous
---
Ok then
---
I agree. Brawl Ball sucks
---
I disagree. I feel that jessie is a higher skill cap brawler, but she is really good if not a little too strong in the meta right now
---
You don't know what support is? He grab the enemies. Imagine playing with gene and having Bull/Shelly/Leon/Primo. Then grab the enemy bring it to you and you have one of you teammates waiting for you to bring the enemy and just delete him. Thats why it is a support. Learn to play.

\+1 for honesty

Vision advantage for people who spawn at the bottom of showdown maps.
---
Someone’s awfully touchy 
---
It's Healing Mushrooms. Heals you 1000 per second when you're on it. Click on the "i" button of Event info to get info about events and event modifier.
---
It bring more variation, and keeps the game fresh. They only kept it for showdown, just don’t play it if you don’t like it.
---
Can’t be to hard to do if you just hide in bushes and spin around. don’t need power for that. 
---
No. Sorry
---
I recently hit 500 with Leon post-nerf playing exclusively solo showdown from 450-500 and I focused on getting my super charged ASAP.
---
I tried kiting whenever I saw brawlers without any intentions of killing them but just to charge my super (unless its an easy kill).
---
Leon has insane range for the damage he does so hitting brawlers from range isnt too hard and most bralwers will just run away if u hit them few times.
---
Once ur super is charged, hide in the bushes until there are 5 brawlers left.
---
From there, you can start playing more aggressive and just sneak behind whoever is low on ammos or hp.
---
Also, dont be afraid to use ur super early in the game to run away if it can get u out from becoming a target of teaming.
---
Surviving until u secure at least one trophy is your #1 priority.
---
Good luck!
---
what is this ice fist ? 
---
Just because they’re new to the game doesn’t mean they’re dumbasses.
---
I’d say he is the key definition of support. His range before splitting off is about as far as jessie  and she isn’t considered a support. He helps out his teamates by pulling in a brawler towards them allowing his team to kill them, therefore supporting his team. He wants his teamates around him so that when he does pull someone his teamates can help finish them off no matter if its a squishy or a tank. His star power capitalizes on this by healing his teamates who should be around him for 100 each second. I feel like Gene is a great representation of a support player
---
Got the same offer but instead of coins is 150 player points
---
There were a few chances you had to run up so that they weren’t cornering you
---
Nothing should matter but trophies. 
---
Either you remove the power (and star power) in general or it shouldn't be taken into the consideration. 
---
In general they are in the same trophies range, so they have more or less the same wins/lost rate. So if on this range people has some problem with power level or skills maybe it's kinda still too early for you to play on this trophies? Maybe for now your combination of skill and power is only enough for lower trophies? On higher trophies maybe 90% of players will have this power level so what? Gonna still complain about it? 
---
Another story is taking into consideration single brawler trophies or total number. I personally think second option is better at least for team games 
---
That mode looks lit
---
You couldn’t see it in the video but that wasn’t an option
---
all the map in ShowDown rush the « WiFi lag «  players 
---
If they really had to nerf him, this just wasn’t it. Ruining his most fun aspect is not okay. 
---
Hahaha sucks for you
---
Indeed
---
Yeah I noticed too
---
Cool! I'm glad I followed you when I saw the Yoyo post. This will be the third post of you that gets my upvote. I really like all your concepts and designs so far, and I really hope the Brawl Stars team will do something with them (which I'm sure they've seen your other concepts already and have talked about them!) I already look forward to your next design! And not just the art, the new mechanics that you come up with are also amazing!
---
You've inspired me to create some brawler concepts of my own with ideas that I've been sitting on for a while, so you can expect a concept post from me as well one of these days :D (though I'm not much of an artist)
---
I got Frank top 18 at power 1, but I found it extremely difficult to get past that. So I got him power 3 and got 20.
---
You underestimate Leon's power! 
---
You watch office bro?
---
Brawl ball is waaaaay better now.
---
hate bugg 
---
Super satisfied 
---
Brawl ball is 100x better now with the update. Also, mortis got a huge buff this update so he did get saved, going backwards would be detrimental to his kit
---
Yeah I can imagine a few levels making a world of difference, especially when you keep matching against power 8-10 players closer to 500 trophies. I’ll see how far I can get before I win enough points to upgrade her.
---
Nope. Infact i die before i even get the chance to do that
---
only people on the team can see
---
over powerful normal Attack 
---
Thats what you get sometimes for playing showdown
---
They have released a spike plush, a poco plush, and a Jessie plush! 
---
Prices are:
---
Jessie with turrent: 25
---
Spike: 20
---
Poco: 20
---
More to come hopefully!
---
They already nerfed HIS healing in life leech
---
Agree...they shouldnt be able to pick up the ball while immune
---
Yep that’s the sad truth
---
Lol ur profile!?
---
Inb4 Leon sweater
---
Big case of teaming 
---
Amazing! I really hope they remake Phoenix Crow. It has SO MUCH potential!
---
Sadly, most people starting off play a lot of showdown so supercell is kind of forced to make it available frequently
---
Nope once someone is close to hine everyone can see him
---
Leave minimum 2 atk when u throw super and when u throw super trap at least 2 ppl and go close to them and burst them down
---
A trick I used to do to land 2cards at enemy to auto aim my atk and when enemy move they will be slightly to the side and hit both cards but ofc if u pro u can just do manually
---
Great idea
---
Im glad they changed mortis. He was only viable in brawl ball and now I can play him in other modes
---
Thanks for your art post! If you are not the creator of this work, please make sure that you have included the source, or to  comment it here! Unsourced art may be removed if you are not the creator.

Showtime
---
Brock’s attack does 1100 damage per hit... Kekoa’s attack is weaker so it balances out its special ability.
---
But the spin is soo much fuunn
---
Okay, I didn't say that but okay
---
Are you being sarcastic?
---
It might spread negativity tho.
---
The bot icon would be cool, but if I saw a player disconnect, I would go stright for them and kill em. The same thing like this has been in clash royale and it was bad.
---
I wish I was..
---
Thanks so much for your comment, I really appreciate the support! I'm actually going to be hosting a little concept design contest on my profile since I've received quite few requests from others to draw their brawler ideas.  It would be awesome if you could participate.
---
Also since I've received a few requests for the template, I'm going to be posting a blank template on my profile, so feel free to use it once it's on there :)
---
Ho did you do this?
---
box is the most broken brawler ever. pls nerf

Wow great artwork

That was incredible :0
---
Sorry. Didnt see any of that so i thought i would post it
---
 Did this in rickety bridge, but I like your idea too! 
---
I do agree something is better than nothing, but at the same time being a max player and getting 12 free coins in the shop does feel like I’m getting nothing
---
Other players will not know because only the duo / team can see the Status
---
English it you speak good no 
---
Lol, so wrong. Unless u play 1v3. He started power is definitely a buff. And if his teammates were behind lower their health for u too. YOU ARE AN ASSASSIN,NOT A GODDAMN EL PRIMO.
---
They are horrible lol good job! 
---
Also in SD. Match just started, 10 alive. 2 chests, far from each other. Why should a guy push with 0 energy and engage a 1v1 fight which is about to last a lot? Usually a third player comes in and kills either.
---
If you are sure to get a easy kill (e.g. Bull or Shelly in CQC) it's ok but I see these ranged guys engaging a 1v1 with 0 energy and stall for like 40 seconds, after that someone else comes in a one of the two gets sandwiched. 
---
It's not smart. It's medium risk, low reward while you can play more safe for low risk, low reward or get to the center instantly for a high risk, high reward play.
---
Vending machine Rico
---
Love the idea but the stun effect wouldn't fly with supercell. Sounds too broken.
---
Thanks! :)
---
Heres a hard pill to swallow for ya. Teaming in showdown is part of the gamemode and part of the strategy. Might want to get used to it if you wish to continue playing showdown
---
That’s the whole idea of life leach, being on your own (Well *Solo* Showdown as well but there’s nothing to do there)
---
It does additional damage to the brawler(420 ) when grabbed by super
---
Do you think so? Why?
---
I see it as a way to keep track of your stats and finding a way to improve yourself.
---
Op please tell us how did you get this?
---
Fake xd
---
Yes this is so good
---
A little F for the teamers
---
This deserves more upvotes,just look at the details omg so nice XD
---
Yeah you mentioned the contest in this parent comment :)
---
I thought about asking you if I could use your template, but figured it was your work and for now I gave it my own swing (with a much more chaotic and less organized result haha). So yeah sharing that template is an awesome thing to do (since it's also really good) and inspires other people to share their ideas too! I really like your initiative, the more ideas the community can show to the dev team, the more inspiration they will get and the more brawlers we will see in-game :D
---
UPD: this is not an Internet problem. "Bad internet" icon doesn't shows.
---
Apperently, in the future you are correct
---
How do you tell someone respectfully that they're ruining the game by appealing to cheap strategies that undermine the central focus of that specific game mode? And that they make themselves look bad by appearing as though they lack the skill to win on their own? Or that they rob other players of their pride by ganging up on someone who out competed other players on the basis of raw skill just so that said person could get an easy kill? 
---
2.5s is way too long. Maybe 0.5s would be fine so you have to consecutively hit them fast
---
Im a 9.7k player, I definitely know how to play. My other point is then why aren't other brawlers classified as support? Probably about 75% of brawlers can be used in this game as a support. Why isn't Tara classified as one or Spike? 
---
Yes, the mode takes way too much time now. Sad seeing one of the fastest game modes turning into one of the slowest. As for the ammo, can't they use half an ammo or something? An ammo per shot is really cumbersome.
---
IKR
---
Which Nokia are you playing on
---
Thanks!
---
Nice name LOL
---
2,000,000,000 iq move
---
Iphone. I reloaded my game and it reset
---
It’s not like showdown limits your play style to teaming instead of **Solo** Showdown (If you want to team just play duo)
---
Oh
---
Ahahaha
---
And..? Not every country teaches English
---
Why aren't other brawlers classified as support? I feel like the way he is designed he doesn't have enough distinction from others to be classified as this when Spike and Tara almost do the same thing. He is different in some ways though but maybe they'll change the other brawlers' titles as well.
---
noice
---
Thanks 
---
I am actually a huge fan of the remodel. First, moving away from the western theme is a great idea because, even though the theme is very cool, it doesn't offer much for new characters.
---
Second, I always thought the old ricochet looked way too much like the enemy gun robots from Robo Rumble. They probably made the model for one and copied it for the other, and no matter which had it first it feels lazy on SC's part. Giving Rico more individuality by not only remodeling him but giving him drastic changes is a good thing.
---
Finally, it more accurately portrays his mechanic. You can get a good idea of most brawler's mechanics just by looking at them, but nothing about ricochet's old design suggested "bouncy bullets". This new one, with the bouncy balls contained in his chest and in the gun, instantly makes it much easier to believe that he would be the type to fire bouncy bullets.
---
There's other reasons too - it opens up more room for creative skins, it actually matches the portrait art, and hell, I just think it's kinda funny. You may not like it, and that's fine, but I think there are plenty of reasons that make it a good design.
---
Will there be a shop offer for gene??
---
I like It.
---
Actually I opened a brawl box on an accident when I was about to save some, and I got Leon from it, guess I wouldn’t use that :D
---
That's what i'm saying... are mentally retard or...?
---
Its known, but the last feature you nominated is avaible when there are more than one people in a room
---
his attack is called the boombox
---
help me out then, wisely how?
---
Time or luxury?? English is basicly common knowledge
---
Thats a good idea, i really want to see this brawler
---
I'm in love with his looks! 
---
just saying bro ahah
---
You implied it, considering having a skin as your profile isn’t the least bit confusing.
---
People already go into someone else’s band to tell them how bad they did. If they had proof of how many times they died it may be worse...
---
Very awesome idea, now you just need to clump the report button together with it and a chat box too. So I flame the noobs in my team that made me lose
---
Wow and I thought my 700 was a lot. Congrats!
---
But i like to be in a team of 10 brawler when i play solo /s
---
Thats my favorite part
---
You expect too much of people. Common sense isn't common at all.
---
He was always able to do that if you were good with him
---
Spike plushie is cheaper to get than in-game lol
---
Me to
---
Nita+jessie+any thrower(for his name)=your concept
---
He plays Mortis cut him some slack
---
I’m just a simple man trying to make my way in the universe 
---
I was talking about his down votes not mine. I don't care how many down votes I get
---
Thanks! There seems to be a balance between succinct and detailed that I want to find, since in my concepts I often get into discussions regarding the balance and clarity of the mechanics.  I guess succinct works for most people, since a lot of people just want to take a quick peak and move on to the next thing. 
---
I might take you up on that offer (and of course I'll credit you where ever I use it).  I'll have to see what I can make of it :)
---
I use a wacom intuos art CTH490AK.  I've had it for a while now, and it's definitely affordable and does the job but I'm not sure I'd highly recommend it.  Perhaps if you're a beginner it'd be a good entry model to get your feet wet without busting the bank.   I'm actually looking to upgrade for something bigger, it is a bit small, and I can't work for super long periods without my hand cramping up (but I do it anyway to my own detriment D:).
---
When I first started I would pre-sketch a lot traditionally, and would scan the drawings in and color them.  I still draw traditionally from time to time, but for all my brawler concepts, I've drawn them all in photoshop.  I've just found so many advantages to drawing digitally, that if I tried drawing the same things traditionally, it would just take way longer, and probably end up not as good.  One other tip is I tend to pre-sketch a lot more and more efficiently, digitally.  My first layer, I'll just draw some general shapes, then I'll lower the opacity, and draw on top of the sketch and either change things or add more detail, and then I lower the opacity of that layer, and rinse and repeat until I come up with a overall design that I'm happy with, and then lower the opacity of that layer, and then do some final line work.  And then flat color under neath, and then I do shadows, and finally highlights last.
---
In the case of Yoyo, I pulled up picture of jessie and her turret, and just color picked the main values from the turret and used it as a general reference.  Using a reference is probably the biggest tip I can give for anyone wanting to get into drawing.  For chozen I looked up a bunch of pictures of monks on pinterest, and found some poses I liked, and sort of referenced bits and pieces of a bunch of photos.  For Lupo, I pulled up a picture of Nita, and just tried to get the shapes and pose really similar, and copied the lighting.  
---
Hope that helps!
---
That’s what I’m talking about!
---
J
---
Use Pam always, you can clutch most of the time because of the healing station despite whatever brawler you get partnered with 
---
Alright now I will be never able to unsee that..
---
😂😂😂
---
love the name change, love the new model, love the fact the new skin is now Loaded Rico and not Gold Medalist Ricochet cause last one made no sense xD now he reminds me of BOB from overwatch, and his gold skin is like a combination of BOB and Prize King from Fnaf Pizzeria Simulator/Fnaf6
---
I use photoshop, and I posted a link to the font and template in my profile. :)
---
That was so beautyfull! 
---
Word.
---
Actually he used to shoot pooll balls. And they still could be pool balls. Look at all those colors
---
The point is most primos fail the exploit and end up screwing over the team. When the exploit works there are hardly any robots. It's  not our fault that we are defending a man down. These people need to just stop trying 
---
I actually love this concept. Some suggestions based on concerns people have expressed so far-
---
While a slower fire rate is fine, I’d actually look into playing with the firing mechanic some. Frank, for example, has delay that opponents can read with the swinging of his hammer. How about having some effect (like a small storm cloud or sparks) that happens a moment before the lightning strikes? That would allow for a very small window of reaction to avoid being stunned.
---
A slightly smaller radius to his main attack might also keep it in check and raise the skill cap, although I wouldn’t combine this with my previous suggestion for fear of making him unplayable.
---
My favorite part is the super being a mount. Would it last about as long as Leon’s invisibility? And does it have its own health (like Nita’s bear) or does it merely add to the health of Lupo while he’s on it?
---
Overall, really cool idea. I’d be hyped if this kind of brawler was revealed, and I think he’d make a wonderful addition to trophy road.
---
Probably still is
---
I guess they had 3/3 it just showed 2/3
---
Nita is The savage 
---
Yup no problem 💕
---
Yes lag problem also WiFi wtf .
---
Vámonos!
---
They could be bouncy balls but they might be pool balls too. 
---
How will it creat lag 
---
These theories are interesting! Keep doing more
---
Maybe for the first one “High Ping” aswell
---
Wheres mid loot
---
I really hope this gets added

You shouldn't say what you think the others says, but you should ask it instead. And that is for the downvote

Yea, but now he can do it better if u kill the target. BAM, instant 2 hits extra

But we also have 3 robots, 2 snipers, etc and he is really different than penny

But thanks for the feedback!

I like meteor, it stops camping and teaming to an extent
---
Box so op even pre-patched Leon would be scared
---
Yeah sadly
---
Yeah I really hope Tara gets one
---
Seems like it would just encourage bad gameplay.  People at low trophies already overvalue staying alive in gem grab.
---
So cute
---
What's the point on having a new Brawler that looks exactly the same as Nita ?
---
AND THEN YOU SCREAM AT THEM FOR DYING (even tho you died first)
---
Really? Only if you have star power? That's dope, since somebody suggested that time ago...
---
Brawl Stars definitely is a game where the community is really heard and satisfied as long as I've been in it
---
Feedback would be highly appreciated
---
No, but imagine having a lot of different portraits just for some brawlers. That could be a little confusing at the start, but not forever. just saying
---
She's flipping is all off because she actually is good at synergizing with her bear.

AKA the reason you lose Gem Grab

guess im a lucky fella. 
---
Sorry, didn't realize I was talking to someone who could read people's minds through a video to know what they're thinking. 
---
Also to comment on this, no I'm not asking for respawn specifically to be removed, but once that showdown notification pops and it's two teams fighting to the death it should register once both players are dead if a player is mid re-spawn it should register as that player being dead and not allow the re-spawn to complete unless their teammate wasn't killed in time and they had enough time to respawn(still with shield) then I would understand the game not being over and would react as such.
---
i will join
---
they need to save him
---
Yeah, it makes sense! My main point was just to have a screen that we can see the stats, and I agree that it can be adapted to each different mode (good point I have to say), this was just a simple idea to see what people think about.
---
NOW THAT'S ALOTTA DAMAGE!
---
I know exactly what they meant when they typed it...it's just wrong. It looks to me like they were being cocky and wanted to get the kill themselves instead of letting the fog take care of their work for them, which cost them the game
---
Life leech was the best
---
OMG A POCO PLUSHIE X3!!
---
*King THICCo I'd here.
---
What about if he throws four leaf clovers??
---
That autoaim tho
---
Gene
---
Isn't it all RNG? Your odds are the same for every box
---
Nah. I’ll buy it for 85 gems
---
Any tips you can give me with piper?
---
Definitely want this in the game
---
Why can you see everyone when they are in bushes or invis?
---
https://shop.supercell.com
---
This kinda happens anyway honestly depending on when you spawn.
---
My idea might not exactly be a realistic solution without making the game boring but I feel like maybe they should adjust the power box locations to be a little more even with the spawns.
---
I’m not the best player but I’m not terrible either. I’m not really talking about an issue of skill like some people who read this are going to jump to. Lol Sometimes where you spawn just seems to make or break your chance at a good game.
---
It is very good on dynamike who auto aim from what I have found out
---
Finally, someone asking the important question lol
---
I'd rather a bot not take my place. No wonder I'm always reconnecting outside a bush 
---
Was this a replay, you were looking at Leon’s inside a bush?
---
That isnt ip
---
Yep we need that and club share button maybe like cr
---
That was made so 1-tile gaps don't exist anymore. Yes, looks weird, but we will get used to it
---
Wow that’s amazing, especially at such high trophies
---
Ohhhh boy, definitely triggered
---
The only time I team is when I'm underpowered and have no other options left
---
Guys if you enter a friendly game alone it creates a “practice mode” and you will have 0 ping and you’ll be able to exit whenever if yoy want but if there are more than 1 person in the room everybody’s brawlers will be maxed and you’ll not be able to leave the game. Practice mode was an extra feature before but now they mixed it with friendly matches
---
It’s for the best
---
Marked.
---
TIL Colt has a concealed carry license
---
Three months later... his hat is actually gone for real. SMH.
---
that's true, the new one is like a joke. I liked much more the 'old west' style... 
---
:v aaa yep
---
Thanks! Just ordered mine. Shipping is a bit pricey tho.
---
Tara needed a bigger buff as well she is still useless. 
---
:(
---
Amen
---
So if you can’t move and die to gas without a counter it isn’t OP? 
---
Ok kid.
---
Too late. They removed his hat three months after this post.
---
Agreed
---
13/0 OP OMEGALUL
---
The avatar?
---
You were waiting to post this didn’t you 
---
Yeah the water for brawl ball is pretty isane
---
10/10 tap fire lol
---
What did u think was gonna happen
---
*”cries in Mexican”*
---
Yes! Ice cold! 👍🏻
---
To me, it still seems too strong. While this won’t be super common, if you were to face a team that was communicating via voice, or even just a well organized group of three, I can imagine that they would capitalize on nearly every stun. Especially on something like Bounty where you would have one person the try and draw fire away from Lupo while he goes and stuns an enemy, and a Piper or other high-damage/high-range Brawler finishes them off. And it would be quite difficult to face him in Gem Grab maps with a lot of cover and bushes for him to utilize.
---
Finally someone said it xD
---
I think kills and deaths are useless in a competitive objective-based game.
---
Kinda hoped you both woulda died. 
---
Play another game mode if it bothers you so much... I accept all downvotes with  pride
---
wack
---
Oh hey Poco
---
I think kills and deaths are not needed in a competitive objective-based team game.
---
Well... When I reconnect, I usually appear standing in the spawning area or near it, so I guess my bot was killed and respawned. Probably my bots have a dumb personality...
---
ew teamers
---
ew teamers with spike

Nope.. Daryll is lets say OK.ish.

Nice drawing and desk :D

I love his voice line, “That sucks!”
---
This happens to me too. I use an iPod Touch 8th gen if that helps.
---
Dun dun DUUUUUN
---
I don't have the skills to make one of these, but I got an idea for a new brawler so here goes: it would be some sort of crocodile/alligator pun name, and it would probably do a scratch melee attack but it's conical like Poco. It's star power would let it hide in water like other brawlers in bushes as well as naturally being able to swim through water. Not sure about ult, but if u like the idea I'd like to see the art and whatever name u could come up with.
---
Stg bro
---
Can you give me a link?
---
Lets get an F for spike XD
---
Yep! The idea of this post was to show that would be cool to have “stats” at the end of the matches, whatever they are
---
i misread "Heiler" thinking it said "Hitler" and honestly i really deserve to be in the pits of hell
---
&lt;3
---
Please supercell I beg you. 
---
Actually I think it’s funny to see all Dynamikes running in the middle. As far as it stays with Skull Creek i’m okay, SD lacks of real maps for throwers. Most of the other maps have fucking bush in the middle it’s annoying
---
Tbh I think a whole part of the game is the fact that you don't see that
---
Comments that contain only laughing emojis on Reddit tend to be downvoted. Just don't do it
---
Left for Dead 3 confirmed
---
Exactly! 
---
Thanks for the compliment :)
---
The numbers of kills and deaths add up, OCD threat minimal.
---
Add a function so whenever somebody hits the play button in Brawl Stars it subs to Pewds
---
That's just dirty, stop teaming, you're ruining showdown and everyone hates you for it.

This would be great so people actually believe me that the majority of battles I carry the team and die 0-1 times

When I team, rarely, I do this just cuz I’m kind

You should read supercell's response.

Its unfair that his regular attack stuns

1 word. Frank
---
Your game seems very smooth, what is your phone?
---
This is Nita with blue hair
---
Wow! That's Awesome dude! You made Jessie so Cute
---
This reminds me, why was Frank’s super nerfed, but only in Big Game? I don’t think that’s fair, even though he was also OP if you had more than one on your team. I think there could be a better solution. Like maybe, if one Frank stuns somebody that is currently or was recently stunned, it doesn’t stun again but instead has a minor pushback (like Shelly’s ult) and more damage?
---
But you are right Poco is the Führer

You can get 10 tokens a day and a big box every 2-3 days just have patience

Thanks God! I can survive a whole gem grab without dying (not every time) and still manage to grab a few gems for my team. The 13/0 was just a joke, as I said before, 13 is my lucky number haha
