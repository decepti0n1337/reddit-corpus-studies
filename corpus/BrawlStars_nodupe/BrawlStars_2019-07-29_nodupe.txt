Matchmaking is based on trophies of the brawler not the power level

I don’t see what you could possibly be complaining about here

No it isn't. You're just saying that because he said his play was better.

Played boss fight earlier (12.6k) and got teammates at 2k and 1k (bull main and primo main)
---
He said something about killing him and cutting his dick of and sucking it
---
Wtf
---
Ah shit, I did didn’t I
---
Yep incredibly fair
---
Your Brock vs His Brock vs Our Brock
---
New means they are new in the shop even if they are there for the past month
---
Never play insane or higher with randoms
---
I mean my upvotes show something else, that people want this future, am I right?
---
I still dont have pam at 10k
---
No shit Sherlock.
---
Yeah, i know that and its fair.. But how can someone play and win if enemys have +500hp +100dmg +super power by default?
---
And you get 1 star point
---
*falls off the fucking map*

It was 2-1 so eh

Don't take these downvotes seriously because most of this sub is filled by 11 year old kids who can't even think properly.
---
Dude you just singlehandedly made me reach 1000 trophies with carl thank you
---
Cute
---
And you were so slow the last brawler that you played says a cringy voice line out loud. Imagine hearing "WHAM BAM HERE COMES PAM" in a public place. Awkward
---
So she just said nobody the whole time? Wow
---
I care
---
Oof
---
Ok you care, literally no one else

Time to throw health turret onto people

Apareceu merda meu amigo

He would’ve got dead anyways
---
What’s wrong as Shelly?
---
Nice drawing
---
Why would you care
---
Dude, it is WAY too hard to get coins in that game, not to mention they added a battle pass, which basically ruined the game
---
he didnt deserve 1st
---
Dude you're in a game with Patchy
---
To you it is. But the funny thing about opinions is they're all different.
---
Now Mortis will be too op in brawl ball
---
Yeah dude, I actually got downvoted for saying cavern churn is the worst map and that some brawlers dont need buffs (and a gave a rational reason too)
---
But yeah I dont really care about downvotes because it's common for people who make sense to be downvoted.
---
I love your name
---
I care I guess
---
nope, it follows you if you’re alone. there can be two teasers and you can run out into the storm and it’ll keep spawning on you

how is overwatch dead?
---
love the japanese lol

#Thicochet
---
Wanted what? Carl’s pickaxe to come back faster if he hits a wall? Go watch the brawl talk, it’s not a big, that’s one of his mechanics. If they didn’t want it they wouldn’t have talked about it. That’s what makes it not an exploit.   
---
Whether they wanted it to work this well in boss fight is a totally different thing. But really how would they change it so this isn’t possible? Remove all walls?
---
So it's 1:30 seconds of you watching porn?
---
220 tokens
---
2 boxes for something that difficult...
---
who wants to play with me, i wanna get to insane 16, drop me a pm
---
Overwatch is still consistently one of the most viewed games on twitch and is currently getting a huge resurgence of players due to role lock so idk what this guy is talking about.
---
Basicly
---
Mecha Colt= Ricochet 
---
Change my mind
---
he probably had a bad experience, or just doesn’t like the game.
---
we got 220 for beating insane 16
---
Maybe he dosent play the game much. Not everyone grinds and stays updated with all the latest news.
---
*RoadHog Has Entered The Chat

Glad im not one of them
---
Yea
---
I'm guessing cause of how they didnt plan to make the rest of the difficulties possible to best without some cheap strat (which worked amazing) so thats why

Anyways, i'm sorry to bother you. Off i go to sleep

Yes they do, I needed 4 for my frank and used the 25 from the cup rewards, and I got gold.

Yeah, I guess! Normally I would be very upset at these types of people, but I was in a good mood so I just went on with the game thinking, one loss isn’t that bad. I didn’t want to give up, and thanks to this Piper, we ended up prevailing!
---
Me too!
---
Dude, SuperCell really need to implement that, some maps of the community are in game but some people don't know how to create maps, and who know how use some map Maker fanmade, so if SuperCell created a official system in game we can get more cool maps of the community
---
Then what is the point of the “replay” flair
---
Before r/BrawlStarsClips was created I guess
---
You got 3rd place and got 0 cups for that
---
If i said that i would be lying
---
Exactly what I was thinking, just wanted to share that if you play hard at a disadvantage, you can still win!
---
So what? He cost you guys the win. The enemy team didnt need to push either. Why do people push the enemy when they have the advantage? It's like you are asking yo use. My team has 14 and enemy had 10. Why does my team want to go and kill them when there's no need and we just need to hold down for a few seconds.
---
Penny did a winning pose while Nita did a losing pose.

You beat me to it.

He should stick with solo SD with an attitude like that. Throwing a tantrum midgame lmao

*Yare yare daze*
---
A lot of people think brawl stars isn’t p2w, but it is, however not only is it a very scaled down version of normal p2w you can still enjoy it casually or competitively (I do), a common argument for why it isn’t P2W is because “if your skilled it doesn’t matter” this is ridiculous and I’m not gonna dignify it with a response, a decent point though is that “with enough time and effort you can get max brawlers” but that’s how every P2W game works
---

Hey Pornography report

Oh yeah I forgot because Marvel did a bad job at making her a memorable character. I mean Supercell.

What happened to that map it hasn't been on rotation since March.

Good job! Congrats! :D
---
Its fake look at where the boss difficulty would be
---
Eureka! Well Done! I am proud of you guys! 
---
Next update though: 
---
Insane L (Level 50)
---
How do you do this?
---
So true she never had a big role till the end that is
---
XD
---
Nice
---
Nice i have max power points for Nita but i don't play her alot or have her maxed.
---
Yea Rico’s scums are some of the best
---
Not true, a very open middle with only 4 ways to enter it is a great way for teamers to establish control of the middle, making it a very teaming reliant map.
---
Who app you used for make the map? Sorry for this dumb question :P
---
Someone need to make a custom games and you request to join and then you hop into a normal match and after they accept you are in the lobby but invisible and then are stacked onto the owners team
---
😂

I have her maxed out with the Bear With Me Star Power x3

Mom come pick me up I'm scared

I'm not trying to be rude but I think it's important that you understand what kind of posts are appreciated on r/brawlstars . Your post is very low effort and is not a good fit here

lol. my teammates have done that so many times. but im crow power 1 800 level and they see my health and quit
---
Nice one!
---
He has finally been defeated
---
Fake
---
I mean I give people a chance but as soon as our powecube tank dies its over. Insane IV atm. Ive seen crows,brocks,ricos - don't really know if those are good. I do colt or primo or bull (all level 10)
---
RIP Bo’s ankles. Juke game too strong
---
App Multitasking? You play two apps?

I am de spy

Aha getting to 700 with power 5 and Randoms required a lot of heavy lifting and luck. 832 is so hard. Rather wait for reset and push back to 666 haha

I know nothing? WHO THE FUCK DO YOU THINK YOU ARE, GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE, I BET YOU IM FUCKING SMARTER THAN YOU BITCH!

Why would I want to come 3rd? I only started spinning because I knew both of them would be able to one shot me with their super and one of them decided to spin too, which allowed me to to the thing I did in the clip.

Oh my stars!
---
Overwatch is done
---
I think with practise you will realise how broken he is. Always try to play him at his max range and try to push teams or other brawlers into fights they don’t want to take. Once you are like power 4/5 he can even solo kill a lot because of his insane damage .
---
I feel tick along with spike are the best control brawlers in the game by quite a distance. I assume you play spike from your flair so think of using tick the similar way. Only difference you can’t run into tanks like spike hehe. 
---
His range is going to get nerfed in the next update I feel. He’s far superior to barley and mike in terms of range so try to abuse that. Always try hitting your targets at max range, it’s so annoying they cannot even get near you half the time.
---
fuck you
---
all good things come to an end
---
Wow
---
You forgot tick, still worth an upvote.
---
Thanks , it was hard to read
---
The stats may nerf.
---
They love me too.. i have no legendaries at almost 12k trophies.. (11.7k because of season reset now)

I love you man. Love your vids😍😍😍🥰

Haha no... there’s no way Pam Attack is healing more than her Super. Her full Attack would heal 270, while one tick of her healing no cubes is 448.

You have to go on your computer and go to this subreddit online. On the right there will be a column, on that column you go to where it says “Community Details” which is the first thing on the column. Then under “Create Post” will be “Community Options”. You click that then there will be an option that says “User Flair Preview” with a pencil next to it, click that and you’ll get brawler flairs. You’re welcome.
---
It looks really cute
---
Yes! And you definetly should put boss fight more. It is so much fun but it's just so rarely in the game.
---
Who’s pump?
---
Are they teaming? I mean do you expect them to hit each other and kill each other  while you hide in a corner and enjoy the benefits of self destruction? It makes total sense for more than 1 person to corner a person stuck near the poison. Well played tho
---
Fuck you teamer! People like you who team should go in hell!! Idiot, if you wanna team, then just leave the subreddit you dumb fuck!!
---
Me to i have 7k cups and i domy gry new brawler for line a 3 months + i jadę 3 friends that play brawo starą to and the or have legendery c'mon

Stop it with the thread it is not funny or original anymore
---
How the fuck? Oh wait they have power level 10 😬 and I was trying that feat with power lvl 7 Shelly 😶
---
**TARA'S THIRD STAR POWER CONFIRMED**
---
Yeah mortis requires skill while other brawlers don't which is why he needs a buff to make him as easy to play as other brawlers
---
You did what wonderbrad wanted to do so badly
---
Never trust a mortis that want to team
---
Your Background And Trophies are glitched
---
You got to be joking, right?
---
it's look like crayon corlor (no hate)
---
666
---
Unfortunate
---
The real exploit is that Carl can hit the robot behind him even though the pickaxe doesn't touch the robot, it's just the damage radius that needs to be changed
---
Ita?
---
my favorite show
---
Kashewz I love your vids I wanna help push your trophies like ALOT I have many second accounts I could help do it with and my main account is already in your clan.

The video is really good and well edited!
---
*How am I supposed to beat insane III when I get a primo and a bull that keep* ***supering*** *into the boss to get the power cubes ?*
---
Also his collision box is really bad. you just slightly touch a corner and you just stop. Or when you;re near a wall and an enemy, and you quick tap and it just hits the wall and doesn't move or do anything and wastes 3 attacks. Being able to dash over 1 tile wide water parts would be cool as hell too.
---
Meanwhile here I can't defeat insane III
---
I think Piper's super shouldn't be as rng and she should land a bit faster

im fast as fuck boi

On their video on insane 11, they use bull to lure bombs away from both, it's crazy, but works.

Yes kinda true for me

Ha amateur , i got put up against a lvl 1 0 trophies a couple days ago 😅 check out my post
---
But you haven’t got pulled and you have 7 cubes
---
FULL
---
I agree they're just skins why do people get so triggered about them?

then for free he will add in game

"They called me a mad man"
---
I got to about 16k and feel ya, idk if I feel like wasting all that time again... all my friends are catching up rapidly now, rank 20 used to be an accolade and now it’s nothing! Playing random duos at 650+ you still play with one truck idiots that are complete trash
---
it starts at 4 seconds and ends at 34, so yeah its 31. i cant count
---
Now then you will make all brawlers to 777 trophies
---
Lol no that is completely wrong, it should be 1260x1.07 not 0.7. 
---
The final damage would be 1348 instead of 1260 and making his 3 swipes do a total of 4044 damage
---
Now everyone is inspired to not betray which is very cool
---
You guys are absolute madmen 🤣
---
I don't know mate the robots kind of added to the feel. Look at ricochet
---
They must have their reasons, but... but... but... WHY!? 
---
I just dont get it! They already hold back on what you get/they give. While mostly it is a bunch of solidified air anyways. 
---
No more or fewer rewards the higher you get on trophypath. Starpoints that can only give you useless stuff only some will like. Just give us something usefull in the shop or give us boxes.
---
Also since we now lose part of our trophies I haven't been pushing my brawlers anymore to be in top of my country. As an occasional player I just cannot compete anymore with those who play daily. They killed part of the game for me as I was competing in top 5. On both brawler and ranking I now have no motivation to get brawlers high, so why would I even take the effort.
---
I think might be slowly killing the game.

”Game isn’t even P2W.”
---
I agree that p2w is what keeping the game alive. But stating that the game isn’t even pay to win is absolutely FALSE. If you can buy currency that makes you progress the game faster, it is obviously p2w.
---
I actually meant clash royale, I used to be around that that though years ago

u totally did make this not clement\_tr42 right

Lol bye?  Quitting posts for any game are so awkwardly pathetic.

---
Just reboot the app lol

Tbh I played a game twice this entire season. Cheers to a last one for now.

Tbh i think all of mortis's skins are bad but i respect people who use them
---
What is more surprising to me is how many level 10 brawlers you have. 
---
Exactly how much money have you spent on this game ?  Jesus Christ. 
---
Here I am struggling to just get Frank to level 9.
---
Right after the update, I pushed dynamite to 20. I never would have imagined I could ever do this, especially when I would be targeted hard in solo SD for doing nothing wrong, and most game modes available (besides my saviour, snake cavern) were meant much more for close range brawlers Rosa was still OP. Shelley - well Shelley is still broken imo- and to a level 7 dynamike, everything could kill me if I wasn't careful.
---
But with the new changes, I slowly pushed to rank 20. And it felt so good. OP, I'm sorry you feel the way you do, but for mediocre/above average players, especially since at 6,750 trophies I still don't have a single mythic or legendary, the balance changes made me so much more willing to put in the time and play this game
---
Get more brawlers to 500. Then they are worth it
---
Yeah it is I said it in the title
---
r/im14andthisiswoooosh
---
Oh I've been thinking of El Primo vs Rosa, with Jojo vs Dio reference + boku no hero academia references. "El Primo is here" catchphrase too damn easy to link, just thinking of storyboard now, any more ideas would be appreciated!
---
Nice bro
---
In normal gameplay the phone will send your input to the server, then the server send the game state back to your phone. Brawl TV is more of a one way trip only. I'd say the latency could be doubled in normal gameplay compare to Brawl TV. But if you're already lagging in Brawl TV, better don't touch the game 😂

dan's cat bibi was super lovely, glad i got to see it again. also, he did a great job with making the kitsune bibi, looks great!
---
I'd love to! But I'll wait till the end to see which I should really draw, and thank you!
---
im at 19k and i see no problems with that.
---
they should just add more stuff that can be bought with star points
---
No as in you’re complaining about getting 2 star powers from one chest
---
Who are you? And what has been removed? Can I call you walle btw?

No one can do anything so why bother posting? Better that you reach supercell instead or stand your ground in the chat. Nobody here will care

you have way too much free time and i like it.

How?
---
Not true, if you look at Rey’s video, you will see that many people quit the game. Although the game isn’t dead yet, it’s on the path of getting there.

Mi domando quanti italiani ci siano in questo subreddit
---
whoa hold up we cant kill bosses if we play with randoms and just a few pros complete the game so good job....seriously?????
---
Let's see the outcome :D

---
There are always random Pocos everywhere
---
When I play my level 7 primo at +400 trophies I carry so many maxed players ,although I don't play primo so much
---
I only lost 100 but I’m only at 10K
---
Then just do whatever you want cause i'll like it anyway.... Your art is amazing❤🍭😊
---
Ive never heard of sama being used as that term, but i think "san" works, and thats a really explanation why Sakura Spike is suddenly Spike-Kun lol
---
I what I think too! Its just a fact Nita has an actual Bear on her head, skinned hunted, ect. While Leon has a knitted sweater that looks like a Chameleon, skin color similar but many other Brawlers share similar or the same skin color.
---
Are you retarded?
---

Did you even look at the date when i posted this???
---
It's not supercell's fault that you didn't push your brawlers
---
I Suck ok
---
Normal match and brawl TV dont arent the same cause when you play, you are sending info to SC's server and they send info back to you. But in brawl Tv you only recieve info from the server.
---
That’s unbelievable do they really?😭

AHEM. *”If you can buy currency that makes you progress in game faster, it is obviously p2w.”* and yes you just admitted that Brawl Stars is p2w. I’m talking about how fast you can max your account. And yes skins doesn’t give you any advantage (duh). The difference is that P2W players takes shortcuts to get star power, resulting in reducing many weeks or months of grinding.

The reset level is too low and makes pushing at high levels worthless. FIX THIS
---
I like kitsune much
---
I would use colt. Or there is a very op comp if u wanna try it it uses Pam Carl and bull , all primary starpowers and you basically get on the boss his toes and the Pam and the bull tank while the Carl deals massive amounts of damage
---
People: makes good project of a new skin
---
Supercell: makes own skins
---
This exactly! I was on holiday just as the new trophy changes came in, and I had a lot of brawlers at around the 500 trophy level. Now its really annoying because randoms are total shit again. I just had a game with a colt who auto aimed the whole match. FML.
---
I was waiting for this on this post specifically 😂😂

I cleared insane 1 with some randoms
---
endgame players are not upset, its the ones below 500 or 600(per brawler) who are upset
---
Oh... Well now I'm confused

I agree wholeheartedly with your assessment. Great read!

If they brought back the box rewards then itd be cool?

---
Yes sir, I was so stoked never had this much luck before!

Shelly and Colt
---
Tu pourrais utiliser Google traduction pour te faciliter la vie
---
I Dont know why, but when i pushed one of my brawlers to 800, i kept getting matched up with people at 200, it was fucking digusting
---
He is being kinda rude about it...
---
Stop it
---
I mean I kinda understand why. Right now the endgame currency is pretty much useless besides getting some skins, and the highest rank in the game right now is no longer something to be proud of, which makes players feel less motivated to push their trophies and, consequently, less interested in the game.
---
I think if Supercell were to add some sort of league system (similar to Clash Royale) it would give a bigger reason to strive and would grant them the sense of accomplishment they had before.
---
Dude, please just stop tracing profile icons.
---
Holy shit
---
Outlaw Colt i think
---
For why?

No,only spike and crow

I Don't know why, but i think i have seen this one a while ago

Didn't even use the new Star powers I thought that would be the cause of this
---
#Can’t resist the urge to jump into enemy territory
---
Use his super wisely. Don’t just go throwing it off like it’s nothing because that one good pull can change the game
---
If there is something wrong, then it is this 92 trophy Piper... in my opinion.
---
Sorry to be that guy but that’s not impressive at all..
---
Unless you know how to use him in solo showdown a by that I mean wait for a bull to almost kill everything and then fire a few times and you have won
---
That desperate Rico is amazing😂
---
I am at 11.7k and have 2 brawlers at level 8. RIP
---
Not bad at all!

I think a star power is when he's invisible he focuses all 3 ammo slots into one blade for his assassination

Then it would be an F

I can already see the FBI jokes.

See you in hot!
---
When I first started playing the game I thought that if you step in an enemy Pam's turret you'll start losing health... Now it's true ((well kind of))... My noob nightmares become reality
---
You mean ahuahuahuahuaha
---
I was pushing my Brock and I faced Elit
---
That'd be Very op but If after there were a 5 SEC countdown to shoot then it's be good and a loading bar while you are invisible so you wait 4 secs só It could be balanced
---
The music just makes it that much better, nice clips!

To be fair I’m not a gemmed and I have a power 10 Barley at 100 trophies. I’ve just been levelling him up but not using him then got Extra Noxious from a free chest. Not fair to lower power players but since SC matchmake based on trophies not power then that’s the way it is.
---
I am now pushing Barley but I’m still much higher power than my opponents.

That doesn't answer my question, but ok

Do you remember the primo glitch where El primo would super into the wall and be stuck there and the bots would always be trying to kill el primo instead of the safe. That was the only way you could get 13m and 14sec. (Also dinomike can do this too) (long ago that was)
