ReEEEEEEEEEPPPOOOOOSTTTTTt

Ikr

Its not a rework though. Its more of a change. Also I like his current second star power.
---
hn ho
---
Thos with no music made me cry of laugh
---
I’ll never see piper the same way again
---
The algorithms aren't always perfect
---
This is better👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
---
Its cool but why did they have to take off piper's gloves though?

And what are you ganna say?
---
Supercell should take a look at this
---
MMMM PATAS
---
He'll never get them back. Uninstall and leave 1 star review is the ONLY way to go here
---
Guys he take screenshot to early i think
---
Just realised I misspelled a few things.
---
Yea, I'am so excited.
---
Guys, listen to Me I don't Want them to change him too, but It's only opinion. I think he's one of The oldest brawlers with no remodel, and I Like It, ans just like You, I think That Pam need to be remodeled, so pls don't be aggressive in this post...
---
No...I dont think I will.
---
Soon primo will be reborn.
---
His losing animation is the best in the game
---
It’s a favorite in both competitive and casual. Of course there are still people who’s favorites are Heist, Bounty, or Siege...I just don’t think adding another slot is gonna fix everything. It would make matchmaking worse and/or longer and it would make another mode 24/7, which will make even more people mad. If there *has* to be a solution, I would be to somehow integrate one of the 3 to fill the Special Event slot but still have the same amount of time in rotation as the other 2 as to not upset the community. 😉
---
I feel like they are going to make the brawlers animations look more fluidly on every update :D
---
Really?! I going to Play story Right now! He looks so beautiful! And real!
---
I don't see the problem.
---
They probably won't in this update, but seeing that there are more &amp; more brawlers, I bet they'll extend/sorta rework trophy road before christmas. I'd like for them to add an experience road or something too because right now, experience just gives ya the 20 tokens when ya rank up and the different player icons. It could have more use...
---
Ryan says not a chance
---
And give him 70 star points, 549 will not reset him but also not give him anything after season reset post update
---
Ima be honest. Brawl ball is my favorite and always has been since it was introduced.  Some days I barely play or don’t get on just because siege is instead of brawl ball, and when I do get on it’s just to play once of each match for star tokens. I think this is great because siege just doesn’t get played enough, heist is decently played, but bounty only every three days... I mean it’s a popular game mode.
---
Lol
---
Frank said he’ll stream him playing 8bit on Saturday.
---
Ooops I didn't noticed That before share this map :/ but Thanks for notice ;)
---
When you accidentally clicked the play again button with the worst team mates be like:
---
oh...k?
---
Teaming don't matter you can just hide for sometime and teaming don't exist on every match
---
Bro I got two mega boxes saved, 13 big boxes, and almost 200 small boxes. It’s cool though cuz now when you get 8-bit you can get him close to max and prob get other new star powers and stuff along the upgrade journey.
---
Ditto
---
Turn up your volume
---
If Supercell Read It, pls Remodel Pam, no El Primo. For Players 😂❤
---
I feel sad for your companions, but this is still funny
---
Oh sorry... It's not like I can now...
---
That is not a new skin idea u just added something to his original skin
---
What point are you proving?
---
i agree that it does not make me look better. i just wanted to use a few random emojis to show my support for emojis in general
---
Star shop skin for Valentine's? Sounds great
---
Lmao bare minimum 500s wow.
---
They do make you look worse though.
---
Real question is why is he vice president?
---
you won’t like the balance change they did this time then
---
Oh God remove this emoji or I'll commit tried to swim in lava
---
that emojis were a part of reddit since a long time ago, but back then nobody tried to stop emoji users from using emojis (at least redditors back then wete not as strongly opposed to emojis as they are nowadays)
---
It is the greatest idea I have ever seen. It will be very hard to reach rank 35. Actually im not even gonna reach rank 35 on any brawler
---
It’s already out
---
It's been 2 months and this pops up again
---
r/emojipolice I'm gonna stop you right there
---
r/youngpeopleyoutube
---
Well I was the bo and I don’t think I activated god mode but ok
---
This will be a new crowning achievement, not even the top players had everyone at 1250 last season. (They’ll get there eventually I’m sure) but for us commoners, getting a brawler there once will be a trophy of achievement much like Little Mac and the champion’s belt in the good old days.
---
yes i know. i did not use emojis in order to make myself look better in any way. that was just simply not my intention in the first place.
---
For the piper mains equiping it a their account portrait
---
Alabama 100
---
The real problem is 
---
All of your gems
---
r/AntiEmojiPolice wait a second, WHO IS STOPPING WHO?
---
Just because they are being used does not make them good. If people are murdering other people, is it still good? Emojis are not similar to death though, but the point still stands. You see the point right?
---
Watersheep
---
I've seen something similar to this in the beginning of 2019....
---
And who gets the rockets???
---
So why put them there? Your support for emojis are already clearly expressed through your words
---
well i guess i gotta write my comment again!
---
Great art and lol
---
I'm at 12k and I'm missing all legendarys, tara and mortis.
---
Well you dont even have a power 9 brawler.
---
Bibi is really easy in showdown.I got her at 550 with just level 4 
---
Then do frank
---
Wait, you have the darryl flair? (__Batman V Superman plot intensifies__)
---
r/ImSorryShelly
---
Didn’t see that you were under 6K, cause otherwise I was gonna warm you of all the Beta players coming to laugh you off with their 999 boxes saved.
---
I saw that, but it’s still a great remodel for her
---
Its rigged for the ones who don't care. They get all they want. But us hard core players get screwed.
---
Thinking you’re a pro at 11k is hilarious. Take my upvote.
---
you noticed that i have been giving you upvotes for the majority of this conversation, right? that means i agree with your point.
---
however, having said that, i clearly believd that if redditors didn't try to oppose emojis as strongly back then as they do now, it means emojis were not a problem back then, right?
---
S.W.A.Tie
---
Wow this was actually really good
---
Im honestly surprised it took someone so long to comment this.
---
actually piper had to wait 25 since she was released july 2017
---
Bultar
---
I could better
---
[removed]
---
no es mucho pero es trabajo honesto xddd
---
i put them there just to show i actually use emojis. instead of just "blankly stating" my support for them, i am using "concrete evidence" for my support of emojis by actually putting emojis directly into my comment
---
Ty
---
Cool
---
Yeah I’m like Kairos because I prefer siege and heist. I kinda think those 2 should rotate because they are so similar. Idk for me the brawl ball meta just is really boring because it’s always tanks and maybe a Rico or Bo.
---
yes, i am a darryl main, and i like fighting very much!
---
This is what I joined this subreddit for
---
Not bunch of inpatient kids bRaWlTaLk wHeN
---
Awesome this truly is amazing
---
They were always opposed to emojis, but they were used so rarely that it never really became a issue. Also, you have also downvoted some of my first posts, but I don't think that's how the downvote button should work. You should use it when someone is saying something wrong or retarted, but if you simply disagree with them, then a conversation should be made ( like what we are doing right now) the point of reddit was to start a discussion.
---
I wonder how many years old is that guy lol
---
ok i will change my vote
---
you realise he was rank 3 right?
---
Carl is not a robot
---
Nice! This fits better than the ATM idea for Rico.
---
Didn't look at the video because that link is pretty risky and also, didn't know you were so retarded because it seems like people do not use emojis in 2019 but you? There's a real problem with that..
---
Im not sure if this has been sad before but: they cant make all of them at once you know? Also they already confirmed they ARE going to remodel him so maybe in next update, or maybe the next, if they dont remodel Pam first
---
Its gray color, that means you disconnected.
---
thank you so much! would you like to be a mod?
---
HER???
---
Love the video, hate the title. You got my downvote.
---
But there is no 8-bit for now we have to wait😔
---
0:20-0:22
---
Somehow managed to dodge 4 Brock rockets and 2 Piper bullets. Damn.
---
Must've lagged out but for everyone confused, for solos it's top 4 and duos is top 2
---
Ah i see thanks for explaining
---
Please don't kill yourself. Life is precious. Don't let  some guy on the internet cause you to lose your life.
---
That new animation is lit bois. Also, why th does she have lowkey an anti-tank sniper rifle in a FREAKING UMBRELLA? lol.
---
What is he then. Tell me.
---
You better push man, I'm hearing rumors stirring up that friday is update day. So get +500 trophies tomorrow
---
The sad thing is that this skin isn’t allowed since it’s clearly related to gambling
---
Hey, Kairos!
---
I got Mortis and Gene in the same mega box lmso
---
You literally just complained about me and others like me, but then again you never mentioned anything about you yourself having a life so I'm not gonna hold anything against you.
---
Wow, this is the first decent map I've seen in new
---
so don’t be retarded, and you are not the only one that i seem to hate here.
---
Lmao
---
he's at 5k. I hope he is not pushing 2 brawlers to 500-600 while still technically being a noob at the game. These are the worst kinds of randoms man.
---
Now the question is what have you stumbled onto?
---
Thank you. I’d say both skill and luck played a part. I dodged the Brock rockets because i play him a lot but I luckily dodged that piper bullet.
---
very clever from you
---
Oh well. You may have your opinion. Just don't harass people and we are good. Please be respectful to people you disagree with. I has a nice conversation with another person who disagreed with me on this post.
---
Fuck people who annoy Devs like that
---
It do be like that sometimes
---
aBOut time. Like it
---
Damn you’re pretty bad at this game ngl gonna lie
---
Piper's eyes are closed now
---
ok
---
Where update in Brawl Stars?
---
Thank you.
---
Bruh, you legit excited me, :( I was glad at first
---
Do you mean *safe*
---
missed opportunity to have shelly and poco to walk w/ you 🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️ and what did you record this with ?
---
ThIs CiTy nEeDs A HeRo...
---
This is outdated...
---
Understood! Good luck!
---
Alien most likely but just because he is blue doesnt make him a robot. Also there are nothing on his skin that looks like metal or like scrap stuff so
---
Damn dude you called like 4 of them a month before they were announced, kudos
---
The only diference is that Rico is more thicc
---
Guessing your not that experienced in BS then... Shelly is more like a blanket check to those brawlers it's Band-Aid that makes her a counter.
---
I bought the cheap gems and chest offer in the shop a while ago and just saved my gems because it would take ages to earn enough gems to buy him
---
r/robogang
---
r/Emojipasta will fight by your side!
---
I think we should have a board where you can find teammates that speak the same language as you to play.
---
Something like this:
---
age
---
14k trophy 
---
like to play x, y and z brawler
---
prefer gem grab or futbrawl
---
english speaker
---
It will be easy to find teammates to up trophys
---
This isn't free advertising friend sorry
---
Colts super can break walls. And mortis’ super goes through walls. So the super idea is not unique, and the brawler is basically just rico with another brawlers super
---
#chew on this
---
A bit closer to heaven
---
Fuck randoms
---
Yeah the one with the nose ring looks cute
---
I mean it’s rare, but not really valuable considering it hasn’t even been a year since it was given out
---
So this is what bo was

---
Need to get a photo shop program and get to practice on that I think.
---
I do
---
Well, I mean, with the "new" trophy balance changes we got a month and a half ago, it isn't hard to push trophies... but it's pretty relatable anyways. ;)
---
Oh haha wow whoops dealt like longer
---
thank you very much!
---
Also thank you for the compliment.
---
What about Frank? :(
---
Yeah, yet I have no epics and one mythic
---
Nice man, I’m not even sure how rare he is
---
I haven’t put a single dollar into the game
---
I don't think it goes that high unless it's legacy. Maybe that's the old rate and once you get one it will drop.
---
that animation is too good for supercell to add
---
reason: expressive eyes
---
I haven’t spent any money on Brawl
---
Rip thicc Piper

for example *her icon sucks* (but its true)

That’s the point dipshit😂😂😂😂😂😂 i was mocking your use of emojis. I need to explain everything to your gullible ass
---
Still Looks trash imo
---
oh cool! I'm at about 9.6 k. we should play sometime
---
I don’t even understand why people auto-aim with poco. His shot is hard to mess up and if you aim sometimes you can hit two people 🙃

No one gave up on this clip, that gene was just dumb

you made the price 6000 because you have only 6000 star points

So that means if perverts interpret something with their rotten brains differently, we should stop something that is done in fun and innocence. Perverts make fricking rule 34 comics for every possible thing, the only thing they need is a man/boy and a woman/girl. The fact that you read these comics or have to mention them here shows what kind of pathetic personality you have.
---
What program did you use?
---
Jessie sd idiot alert
---
These actually sound like stuff Leon would say
---
Okay then where’s the “/s” tag...? 😁
---
Darryl talks! In all seriousness though, awesome
---
I like the sniping animation, but hate these closed eyes and a hand on her cheek which reminds me of an old piper
---
Stolen
---
I found Mortis really easy , but tick is just hell for me
---
thanks
---
in august
---
Tara x Corrie forever...its so obviouse they both always make really weird noises
---
U made lath so hard part 2 i cant spell
---
Thanks 😂😂😂
---
There is too much delay from shooting the bomb and landing it.... And such low health... I pushed 350 trophies in the very first day and never used again
---
They are
---
#E P I C
---
I think it should come today because play store needs to approve the update
---
I feel like Poco would make a good Ralsei
---
Well i dont know but i hope
---
You'd be surprised how hard it is to reach 6k for the majority of players. It's really not difficult for your average redditor who spends every day playing, but my cousin who's been playing on and off since beta is still at 4k trophies.
---
And according to the devs, only 1% of players made it above 11.5k trophies or something.
---
Be PATIENT
---
Good thing
---
I hate when someone has &lt;1000 hp and I want to finish him, but corner/water is about to end my whole career and I waste all my ammo
---
ah yes samonella
---
Thank you!
---
Reading this literally gave me a partial stroke
---
YESSSSSSSSSS! Part 2 and 3 are here. And they are funnier than ever
---
aanand it's the best
---
I posted this cuz Supercell reads reddit post, and I didn’t know that they answered already. Sorry
---
That is me rn
---
its insane that they think a 3 day rotation is a good idea we love siege
---
She sees this as an absolute win
---
Tick bo rico and dyna are all great in cavern churn
---
What a toxic ass. You act as if you did something insanely good lmao wtf was that?
---
Shrek 4 confirmed

Some bored player: *destroys skulls*

Ptoblaly end of the week
---
The piper remodel we were all asking for :)
---
No I just wanted Supercell to add this, but now some comments told me that they already replied.
---
I say September 1st, 2056
---
*****this is obviously a joke I dont know when it is*****
---
Yes. Why wont they name it like that.
---
I really don't understand y u get downvoted, I'm pretty sure this something he is mature enough to learn unless that user is breaking reddit rules.
---
Ikea BORB
---
I didn’t( I don’t need upvotes, I want Supercell to add this. But now some of you told me that they won’t, cuz it’s taking to much space
---
Wtf is this shit? U just did nothing, they all killed between each other. 0 Skill
---
Reeeeeeee
---
I didn't say it did???
---
Just saying what my personal trophy pushing techniques are and how many trophies they got 
---
me.
---
Can confirm, I was just under in fact I think I was 5500 when I saw the brawl talk. Just this minute hit bang on 6k now I’m worried about dropping below 6k

You mean in post itself? That watermark on picture isn’t enough? Sorry I don’t know

When You Pick The Wrong Game Mode
---
Great job to the whole team like congrats!!!!
---
I dont know either but it should be soon because it says august update and this sunday is 1st September so its pretty soon
---
Ding dong, you only commented this for karma or didn't bother to read the other replies
---
A supercell game that got deleted
---
SPOILER ALERT! CONTINUE READING IF YOU ALREADY KNOW WHAT HAPPENS!!
---
I think Poco would be good for Sans when you meet him at the end of the game and that Jessie would kinda fit better as Ralsei.
---
Then don't scroll through this sub.
---
I found this picture on internet, sorry. I couldn’t leave credits. I will leave them next time
---
Spike is a goofy goober
---
Not playing with randoms
---
Why did you guys decide to change the color of the home run bar? I thought the yellow was kind of fitting with the orange ammo bars
---
I know its not funny. What's your point?
---
I want to thank you Supercell for the brawler bot function so we can now witnessed the intelligence of Mortis bots
---
Man we really need a trophy road buff
---
Bull t*ts 🤣
---
When they say its here, it means tomorrow or something?  Cuz i just login and its not here...
---
Yep, Reddit can be like that sometimes
---
thank you for noticing this post ;)
---
Actually I don't even know how I get so many upvotes
---
My theory is it’s gonna all be here in one hour
---
Yes!
---
Guys I’m shaking rn
---
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
---
Guys, I'm shaking. I'm fucking shaking. I never wanted to breed with anyone more than I want to with Piper. That perfect, curvy body. Those bountiful breasts. The child bearing hips of a literal godess. It honestly fucking hurts knowing that I'll never mate with her, pass my genes through her, and have her birth a set of perfect offspring. I'd do fucking anything for the chance to get Piper pregnant. A N Y T H I N G. And the fact that I can't is quite honestly too much to fucking bear. Why would Supercell create something so perfect? To fucking tantalize us? Fucking laugh in our faces?! Honestly guys, I just fucking can't anymore. Fuck.
---
JUST SHUT UP
---
This reddit is about talking about the game, not shooting people. Take your shitty ideas somewhere else.
---
How is it possible, to buff something, that already give you the max amount of ammo?
---
I will buy the pink piper but…I dont have piper yet
---
Pls stop. It's already hard enough to code a game, let alone right after their vacation. Just cut supercell some slack. Besides the update's coming soon as well.
---
“Since Reddit’s day one” stfu ur account is 1yr old and idk what subs you visit to get emoji’s every day and not get downvoted to hell but ok
---
Weary saed jes
---
They probably have multiple updates lined up in advance.
---
ye i know this was before i read they were brothers and sisters
---
It's okey.. xD
---
Probably when Gem Grab rotation
---
I like the pacman eyes😁
---
No you will not unlock the brawler.
---
Insane idea

I pushed Tick at 500 Trophies in 2 days after release (old Trophysystem)
---
Lol dude
---
That actually makes a lot of sense lol..  Hope so :)
---
Mortis Nerf, ugh

I’m having fun reading this lmao you guys are actually nice
---
I wanna thank you and others for thanking the devs. You almost never see this on clash Royale subs. It's 99 percent complaining

yeah! I will make it... if people will see it... apparently the video is taken like an offense, not like advice. That's why this is my first and last video tutorial.

I have a question. If you're past 6000 trophies, will you automatically get the new brawler?

Attack Range:
---
~~Long~~ 10 tiles
---
Reload Speed
---
2.3s \~\~/attack\~\~

Wish u had reached 6000 trophies on time, a big F for you.
---
Look some people are lucky
---
Gee fine
---
I don’t like the new grades I prefer a different tipe of grades  i thinks about star grade grades this grades you can have after you arrive at 500 trophies  but the the update is fantastic 👍
---
And I just got coiled snake an hour ago

Nice my barleys close to being at 600 as well lets go

Wow, all of this in a week? You guys are insane! Thanks for the huge changes! Also I would like more friendly match optimizations in the next update, like removing bots, adding event modifiers, setting sandbox rules like more health or removing power boxes etc.

IDK, i just saw your name and thought you could be one but whatever;)

---
No Patrick, mayonnaise is not an instrument 
---
Wait
---
Dude how can you play with Mortis
---
This works as a meme template
---
The maintenance is now I dont need to know now
---
Accurate
---
Türk müsün bro
---
Oww &lt;3 
---
Thank you, i can' believe someone like my art !
---
Dude your fucking cancer shut the fuck up and let people do what they want
---
İs this update
---
I typed words instead of numbers because the numbers may be confusing for some people. You mostly don't even see the tiles while playing.
---
That is no reason to call the matchmaking bad, then. Your trophies on that brawler and his were very close. The matchmaking wasn't bad.
---
You expect matchmaking to only match people on the leaderboards with only other people in the leaderboards? That's ridiculous.
---
Shop resets at countries using GMT +3
---
I was gonna post one of those maintenance break images, and I realized that there were so many already xD
---
 Bruh the update is coming
---
I didn’t see a spin after 🤔
---
Could someone explain? " Trophies are now reset to a fixed value based on where the Brawler was at the end of the season "
---
Mfw when I just got coiled snake an hour ago and it's getting nerfed
---
At 1:33
---
 Video name is why 8-bit will completly change meta
---
(look at the bottom)
---
13 maps in total and 14 rotations what's the problem?
---
Yep! I just updated and I can’t wait to play 8-bit.
---
Yes, [finally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xk8mm1Qmt-Y)!
---
I think thats just lag
---
Idk im just happy we have perma brawl ball
---
Feast or famine is a great map. Pls don’t remove that...
---

---
Edit: THE UPDATE IS COMING RIGHT NOW
---
Right now it is maintance now
---
Today, now. Check google play and update BS
---

---
Gonna love the update tho
---
Check brawlstars
---
lol
---
lmao
---
i dont think so
---
I'm so happy that brawl ball isn't alternating anymore. 
---
My fav. mode hands down!

This is nice! Amazing job, as always!

Feels bad man
---
Maintence break is now!
---

---
Love it!
---
Türkçe yaziyo ama Türk değilim fantazi olsun diye Türkçe oynuyom oyunu
---
I guess so but the shield didn't protect that much already with 30%, at 25% it's almost useless ;-;
---
You're assuming everything was developed in less that a month which is not necessary true.
---
T_T
---
There is maintenance right now :)
---
I feel bed of I can I will help u give your tag if u want
---
10:00 in mid europe and 11:00 to the east

---
Oops sorry i thought i could use them just expres my self.... and i dont know  why am omis are not alowed ='(
---
No i got it 2 days ago at 1 am (no suprise it was horibel) ive been an a loosing spee, thats why im under 6000 (also i ive played 7 games in showdown aln lost all of them)
---
He means when the shop refreshes, in some countries.
---
 The Whale yes that is much more likely another likely option is he just chose crow flare because it looked cool and friend told him(them) to check it out this is all speculation though
---
Fine my club name is AZY061027
---
 The top player
---
It's awesome
---
damn, i shouldnt have healed her then
---
Update is available!
---
(Seriously)
---
Emojis
---
Haha that was pretty good
---
one minute of silence for that soldier 😂😂😂
---
yes, your theory is much better lol
---
U
---
Yes,same as the op.
---
I didn't like it that much, on the mid you were sandwiched all the time
---
thank you :)
---
Thousand lakes shouldn't hv been removed
---
Finally a post that isn’t about the maintenance break. Nice too!
---
Oh no
---
You were hoping the update came this morning to weren’t you
---
Always available Brawl Ball is the Best thing added in this update!!!!!
---
...or it’s because the game’s still in maintenance
---
I don't think they usually have long ones, my guess is not more then an hour, if nothing is wrong.
---
Yeah it says that until that maintenance is over and everyone goes in and gets the new update stuff
---
Yeah but there is one right now
---
nobody cares
---
Why would u press start on a mobile game
---
Congratz, but no-one really cares tho.
---
Wow great repost
---
Bro thats the worst way to repost
---
Serously you downvote and repost
---
Worst attempt at reposting ever, you even disliked the original post lmao
---
Salut EDUART ma mai tii minte?(evolutia lui spike)
---
You are a thief. You are stealin you are the enemy of the people
---
When i wanna play BS on a bus and then i saw update so i update it with mobile date but realise that have a maintenance break
---
I am sorry for you men, in this update supercell added new ranks, that means that the 10k barrier is no more a big deal, but congratulations for achieve the 10k!
---
Thats fake
---
Supercell probably won't read you here btw
---
Noone asked your opinon about emojis.
---
Why the heck do I see so many finallys
---
I CAN'T WAIIIIIITTTT
---
Doar la mine e mentenanță din nou?
---
Your Title Kills My Eyes
---
That's more than a nice update. Thanks for the hard work :)
---
No self promotion
---
But they are not an opinion
---
Black Hole It's a weird way of saying 'Tara'
---
At last ?
---
There is a connection error bug that don't let people enter the game
---
Bro dont be toxic yes its annoying but just ignore it
---
Well You're Reposting A Post That You Downvoted ?
---
What?
---
That what I mean. Everyone is spamming the maintenance update and I hate it.
---
But in the midst of the chaos you make an actual post.
---
Yeah but if I made it it wouldn’t have purpose because it would just be the exact same thing (with lower quality obviously)
---
And when he wins to be like 777
---
Me too. Now there are only 2 og maps in game, thousand lakes and feast or famine
---
is this guy for real??
---
We better get another brawl talk soon, kinda getting impatient here. /s
---
I appreciate your enthusiasm for sarcasm, but indicating it defeats its purpose.
---
Yup!
---
*F*
---
Bot gang
---
frikkin rude man
---
This bot sucks so hard, it could suck water through a straw taller than 10m at sea level.

I know damn well he's saying that to deny the fact they f'd up.
---
On les contrôlera tous
---
*spammer
---
and I said wait, I never said anything about why it’s not loading or being fixed. You need to read slower  🤡 idiot
---
Well Boys we did it, band-aid is no more op
---
Watch the subreddit
---
Anyone know how long the updates usually take?
---
Spammer
---
Update will after 5 or 6 hours
---
Nope
---
Seems like it but it’s never usually that quick
---
Its for everyone
---
wait, you scrub
---
Bro. I know what maintenance is but do you see "maintenance" on the screen? The normal message looks different. The last two times that Message came I couldn't acces the game even though other player could. I also have the normal message too now.
---
Yeah
---
It’s a game they can give him any voice they want some people can’t stand the facts
---
Nope, still getting the same message.
---
Don't mind me. I'm joining you😃
---
Yes
---
don't forget that you are getting loads of star points through individual brawler trophy levels. i have 10500 when i am at only 10k with like 8 brawlers at 500. now you can get it on 25 30 and 35 trophy lvl too.
---
I take all back dunno first I was seeing a message telling me unable to connect to server, please check your internet connection on iOS now all over sudden I do see the maintenance message. I guess it's all good... patience!
---
anyone noticed there is no voice-over?
---
No one on this subreddit knows what that word means
---
Nope its not only u
---
Tomorrow???:D
---
At least it's original
---
It was a joke about the next brawl talk😂
---
Your post has been removed, make sure to use the body of a post to elaborate on the title.
---
On peut comploter ils comprendront pas hehe
---
Yeah it’s just for you, you got banned. Rip
---
I would love to see more fan arts for sure! And more discussion threads
---
I think I'll forget about her today, I hate the old model and I love the new one
---
Ok...
---
Youre not wrong. Never seen a shelly with bandaid yet cause im at 7k trophies and thats pretty early. Glad they nerfed it.
---
Solid point but he’s an arcade machine so that was the idea
---
Thx for not fixing star power glitch
---
Servers were still down. They're working on it.
---
F we will miss you
---
r/Emojipolice HANDS UP!
---
Uh I see... Going to delete that
---
lmaooooo truuueee
---
Și mie acuma de 5 min mi-a apărut, l-am făcut dar încă nu intra în joc.
---
And people are already posting about the update while we here waiting
---
ocd meteors
---
what would you rate as a 10/10 ?
---
And the fact that you knew I was talking about Rule 34 just because I said the first half of it's motto (If it exists, there is...)  seems suspicious to me...
---
Are you retarded or something like that m8?
---
Keep it simple, dont blow it, count your money...
---
Make new Canadian apple id
---
same.
---
Remember the tick infection? Now 8-Bit is taking over for a day or even the whole week.
---
Yes.
---
fucking disgrace
---
Same but I got tara
---
its pretty fair
---
Actually it’s the 2nd time because a long time ago Poco had a star power called ‘Swan Song’ which would heal nearby brawlers when you died. That got replaced for ‘Da Capo!’ because Swan Song was so bad.
---
Thanks! I didn't type the numbers because they may be confusing for new players and some people. There can also be a button that shows the exact range maybe
---
this ^^
---
Weird flex but ok
---
*THIS TASK IS A GRUELING ONE*
---
I really want it but Iris Tara was in my store
---
Same with Rosa’s attack and super names
---
Is ‘the 8-Bit war’ a period of time where 100s of people post screenshots of only (or mostly) 8-Bit in showdown even though it’s already been done too many times and is totally unoriginal?
---
I’ve always wanted to ask the guys who post these screenshots - do you plan and look forward to posting this image the moment a new brawler gets announced or is it a spur of the moment thing?
---
Is it just I or the game has some major bugs. Screen Freezing and then later on application CRASHING.
---
Update is here but game isn't working.When i log into supercell İD game crashes (android)
---
Why was barley star power buff not implemented it was suppose to be 300&gt;400???
---
I got gene from big box in the shop
---
When I play my game is crashed. Please help.
---
im pretty sure they will notice it either is they playing or on reddit with people complaining
---
New feature: Bots can now play as any brawler of any rarity
---
Expect this to hit the live server in 2 years
---
Yeah and I'm pretty sure Gene had that problem as well but idk if they've fixed it by now or not
---
/give @a legendary_brawler_spike
---
***U N P L A Y A B L E***
---
OH MY GOD SAAAME
---
yes we all know. you dont have to post
---
LOL no ur not
---
Lol you're right. I was so bothered by that too lol.
---
I also checked primo as well and his arms also look better now and not about to get get pulled off
---
Now we all r shaking
---
Please explain why?
---
Yeah I’ve noticed.. asking the same question over and over again in new posts.
---
Same but i got piper and gene (i already have leon)
---
Here we go again
---
Yea spike looked like a carved Halloween pumpkin lol
---
i'm glad they took out eye of the storm but i'll miss skull creek
---
I know..
---
Huawei P20 Pro, a really weird bug for a Supercell game.
---
oof what a coincidence :D
---
I got tara from big box lol
---
Yo I need to edit my post
---
I got Piper
---
Great
---
Game keeps crashing on android device.
---
I post the same glitch but with nita
---
That's amazing! I hope that will be added in the next update! I really like the idea with "speed" and "range"
---
I am a 2000’s kid I understand
---
Tara skin, piper remodel, 8-Bit
---
The remodel is good, but the icon gives me the creeps
---
get into game and see if it is larger? if it is, then it will be very op cuz u can see more than others
---
Too late!!
---
What do you mean? If it is cause I'm was really angry, yeah... if it is cause I said it is because of to many playing right now?
---
Ok thanks
---
Same and I already have crow
---
Well it the choice they make. So instead of complaining be happy that they make great games for us
---
Same
---
He even made a post about your comment.
---
Damn, now that's bad. But maybe they did that for a reward balance or something like it? I don't want to automatically assume the worst.
---
I forgot to mention the big and mega boxes we get at the end of the season.
---
Me
---
i opened mine and got star power and crow, bruh
---
There’s a bug making Android players lag during matches from what I know.
---
Yes, in South America too
---
How long do you think is it going to last for?
---
r/Emojipolice hands up !
---
Brasil?
---
Nah it fixed then I got maintenance break again
---
NP
---
What trick? He's on the trophy road. You don't get him by opening boxes.
---
Is that a knuckle sandwich?
---
I'm getting this too
---
But no one needs to tell them. A group of a FEW people can’t monitor the sub at all times.
---
8-bit speed fell, 8-bit was hurt by stick around
---
Yea
---
Will it be fixed soon?
---
You’re welcome :-)
---
I hate brawlball
---
Hi to hell supercell is doing a great work
---
I bought it and got starpower on Leon 🤙🏼
---
You would think that a person who has reddit and brawl stars took some time to check the literally hundreds of posts mentioning the release of the update before posting the screenshot on the website. and dont insult tick
---
open the door!!!!!
---
*H E*
---
r.i.p me, my sister deleted brawl stars by mistake, i was 6.4k and there's no way to retrive my account back, i didn't connect to supercell id, and i have android
---
No way Shark Leon is 150 gems skin. Maximum 80. He doesn't have special animations.
---
crow
---
I got Pam today only..... Which to play with first now??!? Lol
---
True but it’s update day, they should be on high watch today but they aren’t in sight
---
H even used the same template
---
I too got a piper from mega box with starpoints
---
Siege must me 24/7. 2nd best mode ever
---
Oh yeah I know about those rewards. It's weird to think about either way, I'll try this system out tho.
---
They don’t usually comment so you wouldn’t know
---
the wolf is actually scary
---
Because it’s a popular template due to the rise of Minecraft
---
Shiba have unique animations. Shark Leon don't. He isn't worth 150 gems.
---
I choked on my cereal
---
Hey, it's D'Jinn language !!!
---
BWWAWBAAAWABAAABBABAWA !!!
---
Mentance
---
Removed. Rule 3. No providing information on how to break Supercell Terms of Service.
---
Hut like the new piper icon
---
Happy cake day
---
ccarl is wayyyy too tall imo
---
Well my post is still here which tells me that they aren’t
---
That explains the maintenance lol
---
I felt the same about rush wars, and I took the simplest solution: don't play the game.
---
crow already got one
---
Update it
---
Yeah they need to update it but the piper remodel is good
---
downvote i guess
---
And adding a new brawler, hank
---
Please!
---
Shall I fix that?
---
it's supercell, never expect 10 minutes.
---
expect at least an hour
---
r/youngpeoplebrawlstars
---
Same actually
---
Darn it
---
So he is something between a panda and Shiba Inu Nita
---
You should add clan games or something similar to that or clan war
---
I'm pretty sure that you can't count because the only games where you build a base are clash of clash and boom beach
---
Every END OF THE SEASON?! Welp, there goes my idea of spending all my star points on boxes...
---
That is a potato server
---
Overall a great update, only thing I’m sad about is that Bounty is now in rotation with two other game modes. I would have preferred that Bounty would have been slot 3 instead of Brawl Ball. Other than that great work guys!
---
Yeah I like the remodel and I love her new animation
---
I somehow can’t play the update.I downloaded it and it still says maintenance break. HELP PLEASE
---
#cab
---
Well... 3 upvote in 3 seconds wtf?
---
Wow a robot....
---
Reality is often disappointing
---
no he didn't
---
You and what power? I’ve tried reporting posts several tike to no success
---
Man. I'm 13k and 0 legendarys
---
100% with you on that. The last 2 days on reddit were just people creating the same posts : uPdaTe?! " over and over again instead of scrolling like 2 seconds ... first it was brawl talk, then update time, now maintenance break lel. Tick is fine
---
היי
---
# # # # F
---
Didn't realize I was posting wrong image soz
---
It's a repost btw
---
They write It in the update notes
---
me brain commit die
---
Wait till you face any thrower
---
They shut down all the servers and they're trying to fix the problem
---
Finally the maintenance break...but could it hurry up and be over now? They take so long, god /s
---
it really do be like that sometimes
---
You really are the worst bot.
---
As user MoSqueezin once said:
---

Thx

I found Rocket no. 4 in the star mega box and yesterday i found incendiare Lol
---
Made by u/ChronoPierce
---
Or the matchmaking screen with 2/6 players
---
I am waiting for an hour
---
Movement speed and attack range should be in numbers not words..
---
I remember when she first came out. F
---
r/EmojiPolice
---
I trusted you
---
boi calm down you aren't a programmer either so
---
Yep
---
I need only crow and didnt get it..
---
That account is only able to play with bots in other server. It never-ever effects the brawl stars server.
---
Damn, now, was I suprised I got a star power, but that's... wow, just wow.
---
I guess i got super lucky idk i was pushing my primo when i accidentally started a SD match
---
Yeah,pretty much
---
I really noticed that and i was the targeted one
---
Wrong sub mate. Post this on r/rushwars
---
Fucken hell your don't make such a big deal out of that. Jesus...
---
כל פעם מחדש.
---
ישראלי רואה מילה בעברית חייב לכתוב היי או משהו כזה.
---
למה אתם לא יכולים פשוט לעשות אפווט וזהו?
---
That's look horrid on smaller screens
---
Tara's is essentially just a polished version of her old self, but its still a remodel
---
ухх сукаа повезло пиздец я в ахуе
---
I know dude
---
Ok thx
---
It's the second maintenance, the update is already here
---
Salut;)
---
Every new update in a nutshell.
---
Then I can say robots can blink lul ;)
---
And yes, I've posted this before during the retropilis update 5 hours maintenance break.
---
bruh
---
Please give credit to the art at least.
---
Im sorry. I just wanted to get at least 20 upvotes :( but im not lying ill drop how many upvote i got
---
That brawl ball change gives me joy
---
you made this post in the first place you can't play a victim card on me
---
Karma farming
---
U don’t have to max it instantly , where is the fun in that
---
Aw shit .. here we go again
---
Sall:)))
---
Are you joking? They are working. Let them do their job. They won't listen to whiny little kids begging to play.
---
True
---
Wait what piper is being removed?!
---
dude just calm tf down
---
you played well but others played like 200+ I’m 550 😂
---
r/youbrokethechain
---
Yesh
---
ikr... i refuse to watch those videos
---
Please kill me, I'm too stupid 😭😭😭
---
u/uwutranslator
---
-5 upvote in 1 minute :(
---
You could have just posted the link to my art image, no need to repost it.
---
How can you upvote those posts?!
---
I cant even log in to the game
---
Милашка
---
Me: so u updated the game can i play?
---
Brawl stars developers : n o
---
Crow didn't get a remodel just a different texture and a different animation, a REMODEL is a remake to the old model but similar to the old one.
---
Because the game is in maintenance
---
The Barrel Buccaneer approaches.
---
yes everyone has already played 8-bit and buy new skins
---
And the 2 seconds queue for showdown
---
If you wanted to get 20 upvotes you would have posted or commented something useful to add to the conversation. Instead you're just making a low effort post that does nothing for the sub.
---
Them sitting back in their chairs waiting for the new update to deploy. Nothing special.
---
Because there were a few bugs that made the game crash so they’re fixing those
---
i literally got nothing from the big box and mega box
---
When a crow main play with 8-bit 
---
Crow main: i can't move !
---
I have really enjoyed this subreddit and look forward to its future. 
---
I would love monday brawl lore. You could give a quick explanation of the history of one brawler or section of the game. Imagine waking up on a gloomy monday morning, but then seeing the lore of your favorite bralwer!
---
Thanks!
---
Aye hope I can win
---
Same dude
---
'cause devs had issues with new update (servers) and decided to go back on manteniance to fix these.
---
The model was remade so it could receive more skins, and is still similar to the old one
---
Wow at least put a spelling check on that which language is that
---
Ur not alone ;)
---
he is just a troll don't waste your time on him your art is awesome
---
I don't think is that , the update is deployed , it's just server side issues (back-end code) to make sure all the connections are working
---
I thought it sucked, then I tried it and I have to say that it's particularly fun and useful, so I'm glad I found it.
---
What 
---
?

Begging for karma smfh

He's a throwers best friend on maps suitable for throwers!
---
The servers were messed up. SD games were at 10/10 but the games weren’t starting. If you closed the app an reopened it you would be put into a really laggy game. So i guess they’re fixing all of these bugs.
---
Take notes u/Brawlstars
---
Yeah only the skins but the base itself and white crow needs a remodel
---
I have 7k and 26 brawlers lol leon with star powers (Im f2p)
---
This didn't age well...
---
You know that there is an age requirement of 13 for Reddit, right?
---
I don’t think that it would be as bad anymore cuz of the bandaid need but ya I always hated that map
---
Hahahahahahaha I was thinking the same thing... There are far too many mistakes in terms of spelling and grammar...
---
We NeEd NeW LEGendaAry BrAwLeR. LIKE If AGrEe
---
Wtf
---
It would be too op
---
SMACK ATTACK
---
same here
---
!remindme
---
I don't have money to buy an ipad,congratulations,you can play updated brawl stars on your device.
---
Good Job
---
F for old Piper and the other brawlers that have been remodeled.They will never be forgotten
---
I'm scared to play
---
It happened with EVERY single remodel after the global, probably except Colt. I even saw someone complaining about Spike's remodel. People LOVE complaining, even when it does not even have a good reason
---
*THICCOCHET UNDIES*
---
Get band aid and you are set
---
It's like every 2 min  a post like that, lol
---
LOL
---
Icon is not actually a part of the remodel
---
 Let's hope they keep the OG flair icon, so much better than the ugly new one
---
Let's push a little luck.
---
So much red Wifi -\_-
---
How do you not understand. He just released everyone is playing him.
---
what you mean
---
crashes at 20% loading
---
But then he'll shoot you and the meteors won't target him
---
Cake day
---
Just post something original, it isn't that hard. You can't expect people to act nicely when you literally steal something.
---
we can only waiting supercell…………
---
I love this. I wish brawl stars would let you use duplicate characters, and change which brawlers the bots use, in friendly games. Would have colt wars with my club!
---
I was lucky enough to get Pipers in my shop.
---
Lol, don't worry 1vs1 is easy at the begin its hard to dodge bullets for the enemy.
---
How do you get Tara skin
---
they didn't mentioned it in the patch notes along with 8-bits voiceover
---
These were my favourites :(
---
I feel the same way.We can only waiting supercell…………
---
Just went in for two games, and it kinda lagged on me. I was literally next to the router.
---
Nice😂😂😂
---
When is the update?
---
 I want a "Video" Post Flair, i think this way people would be able to find BS Videos so much easier and also we could be able to explore and find new smaller youtubers.
---
Also i think this would be a good addition and most people would agree.
---
same
---
Why what happened

Can the devs please consider allowing duplicate characters in friendly games? Also the ability to change what brawlers the bots use in friendly games? I would LOVE to have an all-colt battle with members of my club!
---
Who is this brawler?)
---
cute unlike the previous ones
---
This always happen after releasing a new brawler,  because match making is based on the trophy of your brawler
---
Can I have a link to the original? :((
---
I think it is a visual bug, the star power should increase it way more than that.
---
Hello
---
 why can't I log in to my account
---
 I entered the electronic wrote the code,
---
 connection to the server begins and the game is minimized, WHY !!! ???
---
The matchmaking is broken
---
You got star point at level 25, 750 trophies. The 70 trophies will be when season end.
---
it happens all the time
---
Bruh i understand that he steals art but this is too much,
---
Mentally, probably 8. Who calls themselves poopoohead? It’s a failed attempt to be funny
---
I already upgrade my Leon to lvl 9 (my first brawler to lvl 9)
---
Okay yeah you're right, thanks a lot!
---
Wich they could have just reworked instead, since thats the 2nd worst star power in the game but they nerfed his normal star power wich isnt even s tier, bad change
---
I said that I prefer top hat mortis cause his hair looks bad, I never said anything along the lines of your opinion sucks and no hat mortis is garbage. Dude, c'mon read it properly
---
(No offense)
---
Okay screw light mecha Bo and dark night batman crow imma get myself a Tara skin and spend the rest of my star points on boxes
---
It's hereeeeeeeeeeeee
---
I got pink piper today
---
Happen to me also
---
8bit seems a bit uhhhhh too strong
---
How about buying the colt skin first, because the Tara skin only cost 500 star points
---
I know
---
Same here, as with many others the game loads 20% then crashes.
---
This is absolutely not broken. This is working exactly right.
---
500 star points i buyed it along with pink piper and the 2 boxes
---
after a while i realised piper's new icon isn't that bad it just need the teeths XD
---
My game is crashing when im connecting to servers.. Like 3 hours... I unninstaled the game, i logged in my account but still crashes.. Please do something
---
Piper. AMATEURS
---
Just because you get killed by him, doesn't mean he's a no skilled brawler. Lmao Besides, he's easy to counter.
---
Oooooooh 😂
---
It was my first fan art
---
Dear developers, please create voice acting for characters in other languages!
---
Getting 800 trophies in an hour?!  Even if you won every game you'd need about 100 games..
---
Dude, 8 darryl? How bad, sorry man
---
Here’s a marvellous idea ... don’t play Shelly on Showdown if everyone teams up on you?
---
Well we did it boys, the star power glitch was not fixed.
---
Ya so its your wifi's fault
---
i am very confused but in a good way
---
Bo’s too!
---
Had less than that so it's nothing
---
Died
---
I had the same one, but with Bibi.
---
The size of the circle represents your dick size compared to everyone else.
---
So if I think like you almost every brawlers are no skill. Bull just bush camping, piper just sniping, blah blah blah. This doesn’t make any sense. You’re also hating on him because he doesn’t need accuracy, you do realize pam, poco, shot gunners don’t while while you’re going full hate on him, pam has a very similar job and you’re not hating on her?
---
I was luckier at the big boxes on my smaller accounts cuz I got Bibi on both
---
Aaaand now you can see it. Don't listen to yourself I guess.
---
What do you mean?
---
Low teir meme
---
I MEANT STAR POINTS NOT POWER POINTS****
---
I have him level 9, still have 90 boxes left
---
Ooh than i don't know whats rong
---
Except for that she has no teeth
---
Also, he’ll respawn at where he dies instead of going back to his normal respawn location ;)
---
What’s going on with us and the Pokemon sub?
---
Thank you mate. I feel like a grandfather who is telling his kids Vietnam war storisstories
---
Mortis/crow/bibi or colt with sp
---
What did you expect from a walking arcade machine?
---
Moon festival event huh
---
At the end of the season.
---
Brawl Shelly is my favourite game
---
What phone do you use
---
I am Nita of the Power Cube. You killed my teammate and left me his fortune. Prepare to die.
---
Same problem here
---
OH okay my bad im sorry
---
WHY THE FUCK IS STARS A LEGENDARY
---
You can only buy them once.
---
Anyone experiencing the game crash? It's  like after matches or before them or entering shop/brawlers section ://
---
Same on my mi 9
---
Huaweii P10, never had that problem before the update
---
Same here fam does you crash occur in battle or on the main menu cause mine happens od the main menu
---
I guess barley isn’t a robot either. He speaks like a normal Bar man. You’re blind my friend.
---
wHeN iS bRawL TaLk?!?!?!?
---
I think it would be great to see a final count of stars (kills) for each player in bounty
---
Yeah i opened game and saw that i no more have orange bars at my brawlers and it triggered me
---
Literally you removed all my favorite showdown maps except feast or famine
---
Baterry life of course.
---
Exactly but after a month it's a good remodel
---
Double trouble? Make it Triple! And then, just to make it even more fun, still have 10 brawlers on the map, spawned across the edges like a Showdown. But now they must all work together to defeat 3 big bosses, plus the minions who will undoubtedly appear at some point. Supercell! Get on this!
---
I totally agree with you
---
The 😍 you 😝 to 😏 you little 😤
---
8 Bit mirrors are doing wonders for my accuracy stats.
---
so i am the only one that got nothing from the big box and the mega box i only miss leon and spike by the way with 0.0578 legendary chance
---
Mamby a probleme whit the cooling i shalle go to repear it or let someone who knows more about it look at it
---
Mmm toes
---
i was never against the developers or even against the game, i was just ranting because i didnt finaly got a brawler but it was the only one on the roster wich i didnt like ( wich seems pretty unlucky if you ask me )
---
im just salty about it and ranted, thats all, there is no need to go full smartass over nothing
---
**frick theyre speaking in a way that i cannot read**
---
Didn't read about the movement. They took away a core gameplay aspect and then way overbuffed the rest of the brawler, which makes him way less skillful than every single other brawler in the game. Pam doesnt do much damage, or gene with the spread, neither does poco, shotgunners need to utilize MOVEMENT to do damage. Your red herring is awful learn2read.
---
Repost
---
How do you get 8 bits super wider without super
---
Mine was sh*t
---
Where did u get these
---
Bug - Play again says 3/6 instead of 3/3
---
Really like this update. Great work😁
---
Still doesn't load
---
Keeps crashing
---
^(android pie, galaxy note 9)
---
Next time will be when he gets his second sp it litteraly revives him
---
Or Tara
---
Seaweed
---
Rocket blasters...
---
8bit has a third bar which fills up like Bibi's 8bit's attack charged attack allows him to slide back when shooting.
---
If your gonna steal something, be good at it lmao
---
#I.F. I. C.A.N. G.E.T. I.N.T.O. T.H.E. G.A.M.E.
---
I used to get 60fps, but now (after the update) I only get 30fps! How is that possible? I have a Samsung Galaxy Note 8, which is powerful enough to run this game smoothly. I'd be very much grateful if someone could help me find a solution.
---
Sombra : who are you? 
---
8-bit : im you but slower
---
And many other brawlers will do that. More gems doesn't mean you should win the fight you just have an advantage. Mortis will never be good against tanks other than frank if you outplay him.
---
Oops meant brawl ball and brawl ball is easier to carry than bounty bounty is a lost case with bad randoms
---
I have the same problem with the supercell ID.
---
"Now you see me, now you do- *chokes with a lollipop"*
---
Why are you already power ten?
---
Its crashing at 20%
---
Name another brawler who would
---
poco is good anyways
---
In brawl ball you can win a match like with bibi just with bad randoms
---
Just goin to sit back and read all the comments
---
Wow, that was quick! Hotfix was released just minutes after my question. Thanks Supercell!
---
I’m maxed out on all my other brawlers so I always save up boxes to max out new brawlers
---
Are you retarded?
---
I don't get it what's the image on the left?
---
It should only allow one person on your account at a single time, so it kicks you off if the other person logs on, and same for them if you log on. Hopefully that helps and good luck getting ur account back
---
this series is amazing
---
me slick boots,this uptade is really amazing
---
Must feel good to max everyone out
---
Hmm...NO
---
I think it would be cool to have threads specifically for debating about certain changes to see how the community likes certain updates.
---
Im the top one
---
Im patient
---
r/perfectloop
---
Nice post, that’s a fitting name. Do you have a YouTube channel?
---
Frank, crow, bull, leon, Piper... Etc
---
But im so PUMPED about the update 
---
WHEN CAN I PLAY THE UPDATE
---
As I sit there and team
---
New one is soooo much more adorable
---
Pipers umbrella is buged with her face :O
---
There is so much outplay potential in the game you just need to know your counters.
---
Mah its CRASHING

Almost missed it i only got to 10k before the update

Me too it makes the game unplayable
---

---
I know that but thats the problem, he/she will just long on until i log off
---
Screw you, you have a crow flair 🤣🤣🤣😳😳😳
---
Ok
---
these cards are broken... mortis is a legendary brawler and frank is a rare brawler
---
Duo showdown?
---
Haha lol
---
They should make a star player reddit reward
---
Ur fucking trash loser don’t ever post idiot
---
***F***
---
Bo icpn is cuteeeee
---
Your post is just as annoying
---
Do you know the name of your Internet Service Provider?
---
When mine acts wonky, I use my phone to google  ‘Rogers, service problems’, or ‘Rogers, internet problems’.
---
I don’t know what it’s like in Russia, but in Canada, near a metropolitan areas, they offer high speed, they are on top of the problem, right away, and it’s usually not very long of a disruption.
---
I also check the company’s twitter page, as they are very active, there, engaging with the frustrated public.
---
Also, if it isn’t then, but it’s you, pulling the plug on the router, modem, letting them sit for 5-15 minutes, and then plugging them back in, at least for the cable setups I’ve used, tends to be helpful, or coincidental, haha.
---
Godspeed,
---
How? This is OC.
---
Stfu pls everyone hates people like u
---
After been better!!
---
The reason I wasnusing Mike was because my first box after the update had his jumping star power in it
---
My Game doesn't work since the Update is there(galaxy s8)
---
That's cause you probably have reached above 520 trophies with her some time in the past
---
My note 9 can
---
barley is legendary and wizard barley is mythic
---
\#EXCUSE ME, WHAT THE FUCK.
---
I noticed that 8-Bits photo was so full, and also how every other brawler has some sort of background color. So I extended the picture based off the model, and bam! Hope you enjoy!
---
In a sense his progress was reset. His goal was to reach the max rank with all brawlers and now that there are 15 more ranks he’s basically at square one. I feel his pain because I to just wanted all max ranked characters because I can’t devote my life to have all characters at 35.
---
Yeah that's what I'm thinkint
---
If you have 6k SP, means probably you're low on cups and trophy road. If that's the case, keep pushing the cups, earn the boxes in it and more SP by growing your Brawlers. The ones you need will come.
---
God damn it take my upvote
---
I just had the adame bug but there was only one person in the team
---
that's a really nice star power !! 
---
i think since 8bit is released, brock is the weaker sniper he need a good buff to compete with others !
---
WOWZA.
---
Ikr , its fucking annoying
---
He got a helluva buff bro.
---
I'm also crashing
---
But apparently they will release another optional update, stay patient..
---
r/emojipolice kill him
---
I think the new update made it better
---
flair
---
Git gud
---
i had the same reaction
---
So they were in a team together...
---
Alternately, I suspect when there's a new brawler, if there's one on the other team they try to match up one on your team as well. Since they may not be balanced yet that's fair... i saw this happen a *lot* with Rosa when she was first released. It actually caused me to get n Brawl TV with her when I had like 300 trophies :D
---
But my randoms though
---
Be like Bob
---
Currently, there’s no reason to play Ambush over Snappy Sniping, and a simple damage buff, if anything, would just flip which star power was strictly better and which was the one you don’t want to have.
---
Being the only brawler to break obstacles with her main attack, albeit in very limited scenarios, would at least give a reason to use Ambush on certain maps. Could be OP, so the damage boost is cut to pre-buff.
---
Re-uploaded and original deleted because I made a couple typos, one of which changed the meaning.
---
I would say no, first earn the trophy road ones and then, when used, buy the others.
---
Nice, her name is Polly in French
---
Yeah think so, didn't encounter him
---
older piper didnt
---
That happens to me too
---
If that were the remodel, I'd feel we went backwards instead of evolving.
---
Hmm... Who else just commented with 2nd account... And thats not my/his second account
---
this happened to me2, my friend with one player saying it is full
---
However 3rd star powers and old maps glitches are removed
---
How many trophies you have, i just want to know can you srsly win me in 1v1 "easy"
---
So who's the noob
---
bc they Play Duo SD
---
Sorry but it would be to much broken but nice idea!
---
What tap feature?
---
Looks so dang cute well done take my upvote
---
Do you know lwarb
---
He just drank rock juice
---
Can u datamine the whole update? Would like to know future special offers so that I can save some bucks
---
Good to hear, send and email or something to SC, there something fishy going on.
---
thank you i will try this
---
Mee too, any solution?
---
But still that does not shield them from critisism. This isn't how it works
---
its pretty good if you use nita star power that attack 2 times faster it looks like a machine gun
---
For some reason I can both see Bibi and Scout from tf2 making that same line.
---
u mean SUPER?
---
Because.
---
Same  error here, 20% and it closes the game... haven't been able to connect during all day.
---
This is super frustrating.
---
'Aww, sweetie!'
---
Makes sense
---
Same thing for every brawler who has a turret and it even works with Nita
---
8-bit is paralyzed! Nothing changer bcause he's so damn slow!
---
Last blast is a very good star power.
---
Probably one of the best in some modes
---
Btw I dont know if this petition will actually be working
---
It is real but just havent be added to game
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/cx1wqi/brawl_stars_new_star_powers_datamine/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app

Check out this then u will know what star powers are going to be added next
---
It works with tick too, tick will do 10000 dmg with one bomb, it’s crazy
---
he is now not really good and i like him
---
I see the futute. An alien is comeing.
---
👽👽👽
---
F dude, F...
---
OR you find the update is out overnight like i did.
---
And i just realized it .  I fought it was bad because every penny i encountered using it didnt do sh*t . But now i tried it in siege and o boi
---
Siege is more fun than brawl ball IMO
---
Yep the icon would be better if her eyebrows colors were right
---
F to Tick
---
*Ignores Piper's new icon*....This update is great!
---
Very cool but I think his basic attacks needs a buff while the super needs a nerf, but the fact of the changing basic attacks Is really original and interesting
---
then what shound be 24/7?
---
I have more trophies than u and I don't either
---
How do you choose which attack to perform?
---
Una specie di battle royale... ci sta! Comunque ripubblicalo in inglese se no te lo tolgono 🎈
---
This doesnt always work... Even if i stand still someone or the gas will come so i must move.. But thanks
---
This can happen in all their games but it's normally pretty rare
---
Probably happen the most in brawl stars because the player are real and not offline
---
Also brawl star matching is system is optimized to be the fastest possible
---
It doesn't try and do things which would slow down the matching system 
---
Like not allowing players you've recently played with before play with you again
---
Which is also why you should never play a game with a friend in the team when your not maxed or close to max or high trophies because you'll end up matching with a whole team who's lvl 10 when two of you are lvl 5 and one is a 10
---
What happens is that everyone rushes to get the extra stars for boxes
---
Still prefer ricochet over rico
---
Tick can’t regen if he’s taking damage so his star power wouldn’t help him even him it’s just regular El Fuego
---
Cap N gleen? Why do i find your username familiar....

Were you in Kairoslive in beta or are u in crows Hideout

Supercell is the worste
---
Mine just keeps saying "ThERE Is aN UpDAte AvAilaBle" even after I Update it, IDK if it's what your talking about here or because I'm playing BrawlStars on a computer, which is not supported by supercell?
---
No need to grind, just play for fun and 2k will easily pass :D
---
Every fricken time
---
After the update I haven't seen a star-powered shelly use bandaid
---
Nothing happened to player one if something did then player 2 would be deleted
---
Can't play a 2 player split screen with one person
---
No, patch notes says that now there will be more brawlers in bot games
---
Only way to do it mate I agree, gotta enjoy it and have fun else what’s the point. I love the grind
---
Oh
---
At some point they're going to want to make a new Legendary or something because that's one of the big ways they make money.
---
u/Develop_Art
---
I only played one round to get my token and it was three 8bits vs three 8bits.
---
I play almost exclusively showdown unless friends are on so i love having a new brawler to play other modes with to get them tokens.
---
Not sure why people would complain about matchmaking. This is what happens every time theres a new brawler.
---
They can get over it or be irrationally upset. Fuck em.
---
She looks like angry Afghanistan guy🌚
---
Reddit organised friendly tournaments, winners get a flair and bragging rights.

Yea is saw that too when I was playing.

After deleting and downloading it again it worked.

&amp;#x200B;

and brawl ball is great but u bad at It
---
Skull Creek has been in the game since beta and its my fav showdown map
---
Or just keep making new free brawlers with day 1 skins :)
---
They already fixed it they released a update
---
i noticed the420 hp on spike
---
They are asians
---
🤔
---
hahahaHAHAHAHA

whoops wrong chat

Oh sorry.

#CHONK
---
his model changed a little hair color looks darker and the hands look different and when i choosed him the headphone thing moved a little
---
you cant see the glitch in record....
---
Too many teeth
---
Idk
---
But Darryl isn't bad in bounty if played right, no brawler is
---
The point is, no one should wait 2 days to play their favourite mode
---
*sighs*
---
And bo’s mines...
---
this is 8-bit not tick
---
Oh I see
---
Yes this is original content.
---
Yes but does he have a good skin 😂
---
Lol i thought that means pay 2 din but w isnt there, but the that makes more sense, good catch! :D
---
I feel ya I have 11.7k trophies and have no mythics and one legendary who is arguably the worst legendary in the game, Crow
---
HE AND 8 BIT ARE THE ONLY BRAWLERS WITH RELOAD ANIMATION
---
Bla bla
---
*w at win
---
Stonks, teabags floatn't underwater
---
Yeah, using 8-Bit in meteor shower is not good idea. However, everybody seems to be using it anyway lol.
---
50k
---
THAT IS SOO GOOD Great Job
---
Gene stoner confirmed
---
The  ritual is as follows; seeing it in store and swiping the credit card.
---
Still no lifeleech map...
---
Yes. Making something permanent is a big deal itself (star tokens, joy in playing) but now having BB as a fixed mode, will make us play other modes less often. If they add another Event slot. that would make up for it.
---
One of the reasons to love Reddit lmao
---
5 hours a day minimum for the last 3 months
---
I always make sure my lowest brawler is Brock, I hate him
---
Even after the second update, the problem on the version of android did not disappear, an “error” appears even when entering the supercell ID
---
I thought something like three attacking joysticks, but that would be weird. Maybe it would be in order?
---
~~I know left!~~
---
He's going to have tho
---
Meh not really
---
It's a retarded child who doesn't know how the world works. Wouldn't waste your breath.
---
Lol same?

Thousand lakes wasn’t OG
---
yea... same here
---
August update has caused framerates to drop significantly. Pixel 2 xl
---
Me too! Do not enjoy :(
---
a "penny"
---
Wow, jeez! Makes me want to spend some star points...
---
rip the big bang theory
---
People don't know when they're tricked, it's ridiculous they think this was done in less than a month, they think they let their fully staffed places all go on vacation?
---
That isn't that bad. Also, you would need more context to determine that. Those two could have been in a group with Shelley and would then be seen by the matchmaker as in the bracket of the highest player.
---
Interesting, but the power of piper is absolute rubbish
---
Yes. By taking damage
---
Creeper,Aww man
---
No really its the best one i have seen in my life
---
me too,  the only brawler im missing is Leon
---
Perhaps some posts that would allow ppl to play together? Perhaps adding a flair for such things.
---
Personally I would love a slot per mode, just have all modes every day. Or at least one more slot.
---
But these games are all analytics-driven. BB got its own slot because it's the most popular, and the other modes are not. I'm sure they factor in people playing it just to get the star token, versus people who already have the token playing it again.
---
Personally it's my favorite mode, and that seems to be the case around here. I've never heard anyone complain about BB before now.
---
Nerf the damage idc I want 8 bits
---
Hmmm i thought that the butterfly has change a little just to look like 8-bit ,cauze he came info the game
---
I know I’m mot trying to make it sound like breaking news bit just say this always happens when a new brawler comes out
---
*changed
---
Changed
---
You probably got the box but just didn't get to see what was in it.  
---
Also, this isn't where you report issues. Supercell will never see this post.
---
Yeah that was my main concern is adding some new, complicated attack mechanics.
---
Maybe it could work like Leon and Bo, where you get a different attack if you strafe left or right?
---
Ur lowkey a bot dude
---
Yes but probably not. Most people would not want to play brawl ball with a Piper willingly.
---
Theory crafting? Sure, but so are you.
---
Great i guess?
---
incredible job!
---
pipers ear is clipping through her umbrella like brocks rocket launcher

My game loads at a constant 60FPS, which feels so good, but it crashes as well lol, I hope this gets fixed soon

Naah the snail is much more faster.(Just joking)

Oh he’s pretty fun so far

This is great. I notice that the game is crashing often which was weird. I am glad that you are aware of this.

I got Leon today too

Old piper icon is better
---
No, thank goodness. It’s really a lot more confusing now, unfortunately, but fundamentally works the same way it did before. Just with more even increments to everything, I guess.
---
oh, my bad
---
put home run on 8 bit 
---
even more boom
---
But by end of day... surely?
---
Wish I could send you some coins brother!
---
It is going to bother me a lot... I was pushing to 500 to fill up the bar, and now it is pretty much always going to be empty, since you lose at least half of the trophies over 500 each season, and it would take a while to fill it back up. So, first half of the season with empty or half-filled bar, and a huge effort just to see it empty again once the season ends :(
---
That’s kinda what I was thinking but more of a movie poster vibe yk
---
snails don't shoot lasers
---
put robo retreat on 8 bit
---
too much boom
---
He was made so slow to balance out his hight damage,high health and long range. Speed increase doesnt make much sense
---
Just imagine him in Boss Fight
---
i dare people to make a friendly game with 10 people all 8bit and use their super at the same time
---
Long shots are very situational and dont matter much, point blank is where he shines the best and the changes dont affect it and yet the shield got nerfed
---
Just wait and see darryl in bottom tier for almost every mode
---
you can pigeonhole it if you want, but in certain situations it's killer. Close-range ambush in Brawl Ball, followed by a super then 3 more shots can take out the entire other team.
---
I actually use "Scratch" the easy programming web site, I try my best but the quality isn't near as good as other artists, it's not great but at least it looks better than on paper (colors, presentation,...)
---
Because this community doesn't let them fix it.They think that supercell can do the bug fixes in some min.
---
😳😳😳
---
Oh lmao

this is some high level glitchyness
---
that a launcher
---
It's "Player 1, get ready", not Player 1 Gameplay.
---
I tried, kinda got flanked on all sides but yeah that makes sense, hide behind walls and they cant run
---
How much mythics? I have only 1
---
Yes, but 6 of them going pew pew at each other is pretty fun
---
Of course. The full health down to 2000 is such a nerf. Almost makes me want to take back my 1500 star points.
---
Oh, we got an amazing update... So...
---
We gotta find something to complain... 
---
*that btw everyone should have complained  about already.*
---
OwO
---
I know, the numbers I just said were for point blank, or almost point blank since you can't really stay at point blank all the time
---
Lol. 
---
Daisy is always better than Peach, even in a situation like this.
---
Nice skin, can you do that with the remodeled Piper?
---
Pretty sure that’s a you problem
---

---
r/uselessnobody
---
Stop, get some help.
---
Srsly take a bit of a break.  You deserve and need one.
---
If you let Supercell know how you feel in game they direct you to post those thoughts on Reddit.  Nothing else I can do other than let them know.  I would prefer to do it in game, so they can see I'm a paying customer.
---
He is good in 3 v 3 game modes because he can chain his super, which is one of the most broken ones. 
---
Other than that, every tank and bruiser out-damages him and has more health than him.
---
Cry more and leave, more room for players that actually respect the game and the developers who put thousands of hours of hard work into every update.
---
*everybody gangsta until the arcade machine grows legs and arms.  XD
---
Maybe we could somehow incorporate what gang you’re a part of in your tag instead of just what your favorite brawler is.

brock's true successor
---
Aw you legend &lt;3
---
No it’s dangling from behind him. It’s more like a tail!
---
bull's icon is uh
---
Nope.  Just because a vocal minority loves something, does not make it the case.  I play with a regular group and I don't know anyone that likes the Brawl Ball game mode.
---
If it makes u feel better check my last post
---
Lol, they still haven’t fixed Brock’s
---
Lol I cannot even reach usual me ha bo
---
Me and the bois on our way to gekyumes circumcision
---
It’s based on trophy range, so since 8bit is new everyone who’s playing him is at low trophies and he’s mostly the only brawler played at 0 to 100 trophies
---
Yo plenty of people are still getting bad FPS even after the latest update. Galaxy note 9 :/
---
Or I’ll make a new account and hope I don’t get Piper.
---
Every time I look at her, I actually feel like I’m gonna vomit.
---
I can adjust to the rest of the changes, even the ranks, but not the Piper remodel.
---
And I have Piper, it stinks.
---
New Piper icon looks great. Almost looks anime. The info icon is a bit too much, I'd most likely skip whatever is on it and just play
---
Primo looks like a white dude in a tan meat suit
---
Guys I'm shaking there's an earthquake please help-
---
Ur Darryl gives me anxiety
---
If you don't like posts like these, then you should probably get out of Reddit.  Supercell customer support directs players to Reddit, rather than passing the information along.  I would prefer to let them know how I feel within the game, so they can see how the people that pay their bills feels about the game.
---
That's Jessie's one, where Scrappy follows her.
---
Notice how I use the humour flare. Not the bug or discussion flare
---
Love it when my random teammates fight to get bolts after the last seige is over 🤦‍♂️
---
(Even slower) 8bit in spike super
---
TeNaTiCiOuS b
---
Now that brawl ball is in the game every day it occurred to me that I could create a new map.
---
You’re just one of those people that love to complain about everything. The piper remodel looks a lot better, gave her personality, and actually clean looks. But your just gonna keep crying.
---
Thanks, ive never seen this til now
---
Bruh your below 6k also. You haven’t really played the game for that long lmao
---
More strategy guides would be slick

Using a bug to achieve any result would be considered an "exploit" in CS terms. Even if the only advantage is making you smile.

I unlocked gene today and I was the only person not using 8-bit in showdown
---
I have 0.1344 and not a single legendary...why am I in this “ppl not getting legendarys at 15k” stuff??
---
Yeah but it wasn't introduced in the future. It comes out in the future. (Although at the time of posting this it came out in the past)
---
As a fellow member of the Nova esports (Light). You deserve a full shoutout and and your name on some sort of hall of fame. Nice job!
---
No one is gonna mention that one of the 8-Bits attack another 8-Bit?
---
Worth mentioning that Spike SP was "kind of" leaked by supercell themselves in its Twitter account before removing the video where stated that
---
8-Bit is such a fun brawler, from visual design to sound design, and the particle effects 8-Bit is just an awesome addition to brawlstars and I'm excited to keep playing him. I made this comic today just as a fun idea to how he must have joined the game.
