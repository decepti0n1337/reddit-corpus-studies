Yes, please. Exp levels are just another source of occasional pretty lights and flashy animation for immediate reward - and some tokens now and then.

Sometimes is 4 and im no referring to the ammount, they are always there, everybody missed

Slow down dude, if you're so offended from his art then why are you here then?

Shouldn't you be in another sub instead of being a dunce
---
r/emojipolice

They are not always there. Sometimes there are none in that specific corner. Like I said box locations are completely random
---
Sorry to tell you, but he raid go cancelled. They're doing a festival instead.
---
I never seen that!
---
Be quiet, we can‚Äôt let the non-throwers get this knowledge

Just camp in SD if you want them that bad
---
Hahahaha thats so funny because leon is actually brain dead
---
Your thought of humor is poor.
---
I love it!
---
Thanks bro
---
"Get the whole enemy team in it"
---
no. sorry
---
It seems like everything short of 20k or Rank 30 isn‚Äôt an accomplishment anymore; Supercell made everything so easy
---
lucky, retard
---
I was not in a losing streak I gained around 80 cups with Shelly in showdown
---
It was just the kind of ironic humour
---
F
---
Without them making it easy you wont be at 10k, I'm pushing my leon to rank 30 but season reset is gonna destroy my leon's trophies
---
Oh wow, nice job. That impressed me again. You have been proven worthy
---
Guys, chill out. I have 12k but I don't have Piper.
---
You're so bad that you somehow didn't manage to get star player
---
Daggers? They're shurkins, also in the normal leon that replaced with a candy bar

Get your 8bit and rock with it

I know bro ,but he will get u don't worry ,I got Leon when I am at 12k trophies,it was my 1st legendary brawler and that time I didn't had mythic and epic brawlers also
---

Yes. I hope it will reach the game someday.

brawl stars is the new fortnite

Yes, level 100 to earn nothing

she walks a lonely road, the only road that she has ever known
---
By the way you are supposed to take the boss down, not litteraly everything else
---
I was thinking about giving a decent amount of gold
---
r/lostredditors
---
Definitely like jessie's attack but stronger and weaker at the same time. Since Rico's shots are 5 bullets, it is easier to dodge if u are quite distant to the target
---
Oh man, I think I am lucky, I have Bibi and Gene the same day, got Sandy literally in my first 8 boxes
---
No because you are a no-hat Mortis.
---
Ur shit too
---
Not high
---
Alr 18k Long ago
---
But why not keep them gated by levels? It is better for player retention this way.
---
XD
---
Thank youüòç
---
it gives you special level offers when you reach a certain level.. but who buys them anyways
---
Lmao I have it at 756 last year December it was much harder to push back then
---
While playing Takedown, you need to make damage on the robot. Who makes more wins. But some people confund it with showdown and only care about killing each other.
---
Hope it helped you to understand!
---
I love doing this with primo, so satisfying how deadly his super is, despite it being so simple.
---
Fine I'll change it
---
I noticed most of your star power names have ‚Äòheavy‚Äô in it. Maybe use other words?
---
Less
---
Ur not stupid his stupid
---
Youtubers, am I right?
---
Bruh you have level 10 and u still lost this means u have less skill than them

I'd love the be a master Gator some day

I pushed him when he first came out. So people really didn‚Äôt know how to counter him. Usually in gem grab and duo showdown
---
Contact Supercell support and state you lost access to your account. They‚Äôll ask stuff like your level, what club you‚Äôre in, what device you used etc to confirm your identity.
---
Can you please make a Penny x Jessie fanart? Pleaseee
---
U get really good experience deals that u can buy at certain experience levels if ur a p2w

If someone can re animate this into digital drawing, it would be amazing

New brawler? Really???

Shelly's is abit op. She could just walk up to u like that lol.

I was legitimately playing a match here. I then came up with the idea to post it. (Which should not have 1.4k upvotes)
---
Dile a tu mam√° que la amas

This happened to me, didnt feel like a win but I guess +1 trophy is better than -100
---
Nobody
---
What is the bottom
---
Recently got 120+ on bots so incorrect. It‚Äôs easy to get powerups with bots on the maze one with mortis or whoever
---
I really hope the majority of players don't lurk this subreddit, because if I see a Mortis mimic this clip and do this to me, I'm going to drop my phone and check back in 10.
---
It's for lunar new year..
---
What do you mean?
---
Wow! Aight health you could take 1 Shelly super!
---
And here i am with 10 lvl 7 brawlers that can go straight to lvl 9
---
Well you could immediately scroll upwards after you see it for a split second
---
this
---
Im Rob-ing you
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Look at the name
---
She's only bad in tight brawl ball maps where her shots are blocked by walls
---
Backyard Bowl is a good map for her
---
Great job!
---
you want skins or tiny progress? opening more boxes won't guarantee a legendary, all it does is increases chances. kairos couldn't get leon out of 600 boxes aka 60 mega box. 6 mega box is 10% of that. 
---
you will unlock all brawlers eventually but you can  never buy skins without gems and star points. good luck deciding.
---
Nice reference
---
*poof*
---
don't know where it goes
---
That a good idea) I want this in Brawl Stars
---
Meh, reddit.
---
Mortis with coiled snake tho
---
Try 6969
---
I think what they mean is that if it bounces off of a brawler it would do the normal damage but also bounces off of the brawler. Then if it hits another brawler it does less damage.
---
On coc you get statues when you pass certain levels.
---
Terribly sorry, but is this line of text from an anime? I‚Äôm just a wee bit weirded out...
---
Maybe like for tick you could put
---
‚ÄòHastened Head‚Äô ( since it goes fast )
---
Instead? Just a suggestion
---
Also, work on ya spelling bro
---
Steal - steel 
---
Vacum - vacuum
---
This is a very interesting idea. It's sort of a mix of Carl and Rico  feel like. I also love the idea of a mythic tank and this would work very well. In addition, we need more diversity in tanks in this game so seeing this makes me happy. Although, I don't understand the super very well; can someone explain it?
---
Once you max your powerpoints, even if u haven't upgraded all your brawlers, you'll get more gold per box which will allow you to buy star powers and level up your brawlers, which is still useful.
---
I didn‚Äôt drop to get this, I just noticed I had it while pushing lol
---
Indeed you are right
---
I shall just wait for a different map to post a Piper in Brawl Ball thingymabob again.
---
What's the worst map for her anyways?
---
True though. As Kairos says, those powercubes are tasty
---
Second star power too op, first one not enough
---
1. Please punctuate. This title was real confusing to read.
---
2.  When you get everything from a category, the % that belonged to it gets redistributed to other categories (most of the % goes into power point chance). This has always been the case since global, the difference is that now they actually show the percentage being redistributed.
---
tl;dr:
---
We will still get new brawlers, don‚Äôt worry
---
omg 6 minute one gameüòÇ
---
Not my finest work, I know, but a request is a request! Request taken!
---
I understand mann... It happens to me sometimes.

Haha
---
Guys I‚Äôm actually blind I thought that Pirate Gene was a clown of some sort and i still see a clown I‚Äôm-
---
I know üòÖ but as a f2p, im struggling to get an epic brawler or mythic so as legendary
---
It only deals less damage when it bounces off a brawler
---
Er I'm just asking you to push to 6969
---
Ikr, people must be smoking something.
---
It would've been funnier if solo showdown was the last frame since it's the biggest joke
---
you can try saying to support that your kid cousin spent the money so you had to refund. if he only bought gems but didn't use them then you have chance. but  if you opened boxes or used up gems then you will stay banned.

the cousin is the true el primo

---
Gems...
---
Took me 7 but I also did it with Pam.  Focused more on the bot than cubes and other players.
---
I was doing it with mortis but if you go after 150 gems your game WILL crash
---
The painting contest they‚Äôre finally getting the gems for those who made some of the artwork in the fanmade stuff I believe
---
Tbh, takedown‚Äôs only current problem is that the Boss often moves to a corner of the map.
---
I made a post that suggests a ‚ÄúBinding Zone‚Äù in the middle of the map for the boss. The boss would still be able to walk out of this zone to attack brawlers, but if it ever dashed it would go back to it, instead of going further out. 
---
There could also be a damage buff to the boss while it is outside such zone, to discourage brawlers from kitting it away.
---
Git gud kid

Yeah, enjoy your downvotes!

And?

How is it lucky

What about bo?
---
just saw your profile , makes a lot of sense , your are just one of those noobs who use trophy inflation to get trophies , i mean u have 18k but like 1k 3v3 wins , and that explains a lot
---
Cant even go further on rank 20 on some brawlers
---
About 4 are rank 20
---
Says a robot that is made by that girl
---
You need to be like level 5 to make friendly games and to change name but I'm pretty sure that everyone has a bigger level than 5
---
I think ur the noob who uses trophy inflation
---
thx
---
I mean it takes time I play 1 hour Everyday that‚Äôs a lot
---
dude how old are you , lol even a 10 yo can come up with arguments of his own. besides im going to stop replying to someone who thinks they are good but have only 1k 3v3 victories , i mean my friend who is at 9k trophies (he doesnt play ) has more 3v3 victories than you , lol
---
Cause I main duo showdown holy shit I Guess ur a blind kid
---
Correction, Minecraft is better.... Not the best....
---
Its not Nita, its her bear Bruce so you should call it Doge Bruce.
---
I‚Äôve played a couple of games, and as you can see the replays have failed or are not ‚Äúavailable‚Äù yet. Idk if supercell talked about this issue and I‚Äôm not aware or if it‚Äôs an unknown bug. Hope it‚Äôs fixed soon.
---
Plus I have 1200 3v3 wins when the fuck did I have less than 1k wins u are rlly a blind sun of a gun
---
dumbass , playing duos doesnt make you good at the game , but i guess you wouldnt understand that cause you are a noob
---
This is kinda cute ngl
---
...I‚Äôve never heard anything more ignorant
---
12k and just got primo? Isn‚Äôt that exaggerated?
---
Ironic is really funny congrats everyone laughs

A power 1 crow at rank 18 means that he is skilled. Unlike you that autoaims everyshot

You can‚Äôt post the man, the myth, the legend GediKors work and expect people to think it‚Äôs yours

Oh. It's just surpsing since most people that complain about that have like....14k? Kinda like a 7k player complaining they don't havw legendaries

Thanks

Ok man

Be happy about it

Actually, I think it was Obi-wan

They just stole your money bruh

You won‚Äôt be able to see a replay right after you finish a match, give it time to load. Sometimes replays are lost though

But still in mid high trophy road you still get 30 coins and i don't think that's good. And also i don't have legendary hahaha feels so bad

Like youre throphies.

Yeah pretty much

It stays there forever if you're not connected

What you saying

yeah coins would be great. people really need to upgrade to brawlers
---
Supercell: but.. you can unlock avatars...
---
because your signal on your wifi or load is weak
---
Wait free gems?! Wath did I miss?????
---
Out of all legendary brawlers, It most certainly benefited Leon the most
---
Leon is busted in both Takedown and Lone Star, Crow is amazing in Lone Star But horrendous in Takedown, Spike is around average in both and I don‚Äôt have enough analysis on Sandy, but based on the damage output, I can feel that he won‚Äôt be as good as Leon
---
Exactly my thoughts. If they will not remove the coins, just add more rather than giving few amount on high trophies
---
You dont Need legendaries to progress
---
Flop

cool map but that 1 tile gap in the up right and bottom left corners should be removed ;)

Sorry. The art is amazing though

Will do. But i sure will get fertilise from the boxes. I always get the bad star power.

Yes. Because they added sandy in to the game . The chances are higher to get a brawler.

yeah those click ait vids are annoying. but are very successful

Yeah i remember defensing the rubo romble safe from the minis when the boss is near XD , Idk how i was thinking it's very helpfull to my teamates

For P2W yes but For F2P Offcourse no
---
Yes, all star powers need to be ballanced with the other star powers
---
Tell me this is fake
---
this idea should be promoted in this sub cause currently the water in showdown doesn't have any use other than cornering
---
his voice line "SANDSTORM!" sounds like joel voiced it

Come in they are working hard and he don't even have any proof that he didn't ask for a refund (I hope he is not taking it) they cannot give free gems to someone. Please understand it

Yeah. I mean, I don't really like Brawl Stars NSFW but the ones I saw were pretty well made.

---
I'm saying the coin count
---
How are you gonna see it this before you play it?
---
Do whatever you want, I just didn't find it funny. That's it
---
should i change it then :/
---
Then how does it work?
---
If Supercell, a company that has made billions on Apple‚Äôs platform, doesn‚Äôt have a line of communication to sort out customer service issues with Apple then the entire customer service system needs to be revised lol
---
If you like it then you should keep it
---
okay :)
---
I've watched a friend play showdown loads and I've never seen it
---
Why you care?
---
#NICE
---
 But you shouldn't play any Supercell game or use reddit till you're 13. That's the rules

After opening the trohpy road mega boxes and not getting a single new brawler and not even any new star power i gave up opening mega's. Saved up to 300 gems

Prolly because gladiators look like gladiators regardless of which game they‚Äôre in ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

bro üòéüí™
---
Srry just the offer again my editing skills are wonky so i cant make it i was gonna do 550 but i dont know how
---
I did the same too lol :)))
---
Good job ^^
---
This is next fucking level
---
Actually I‚Äôm not f2p it‚Äôs just that I didn‚Äôt ask for a refund
---
And for tgose who has all 4 legies
---
lol the ryan senpai is the best frame between all of them XD
---
How did you did that
---
No cuz I didn‚Äôt show my account in this vid
---
Yes I did and that might be true
---
I'm the 1k upvoter.
---
Spanish is like a kid trying to talking portuguese
---
Someone do this with darryl instead of bo üòÇ
---
I feel like the RNG gods like me enough. Today I unlocked Mortis. Of course that means I won't get Sandy soon but still. Hahaha.
---
Nice bean
---
They still look up your acc or any account that refunds gems lol
---
Constan»õa?! Acolo stau si eu :3
---
Much better way of Balancing it!
---
That sneaky greedy supercell
---
Thanks? Lol
---
U get a pity upvote
---
That Nita is cute If i can say
---
What‚Äôs your leg/mythic chances?
---
That is just a frame,he used different colours and styles,he made a full animation unlike you...
---
You have suceeded to getting a life
---
Oh thank you I misunderstood.
---
Good mech foi...
---
yes now imagine beach brock shooting summer jessie its a water party *insert lenny*
---
we need ultra box which is 100 normal boxes at the end of the trophy road
---
Grits means dust
---
Hmmmmmm
---
yes yes yes yes yes
---
Pirate Frank. One leg could have a peg leg. He could hold an anchor. And he could have pirate captain clothes on.
---
Leg: .07
---
Myth: .29
---
Omg!!! Nice!!!
---
May i ask what is that game files (or where to find)
---
I still don't have any legendaries, but I got all epic and mythic brawlers (except gene) in mini boxes. I can say I'm kinda lucky
---
DOWN VOID!,Nah I'm Just Kidding HUGE UP VOIDE Just For You!!~;)‚ù§Ô∏èüëåüèª
---
Hahah sorry i wrote wrong lol
---
That's why you don't use your supers at the spawn area unless there are too many robots and game is almost over. When the walls are still up short range isn't that much of a problem and tanks have the best dps (or at least better than jessie). no hate :D
---
18* sorry
---
Cool
---
It aint lucky if you get brawlers from mini boxes
---
Both
---
Oh! Anyways the drawing is awesome!! :)
---
So ur telling me 0.1661 is low legendary drop rate?
---
This is why I prioritized my Pam to upgrade first to max; feel free to add me.
---
yea ik....but very few players play good with tanks. all tanks ive met so far just use their super on a single robot for no reason .....shortage of good players =(
---
Ill take it
---
Nice
---
You don‚Äôt have to be mean about it.... even if it‚Äôs kinda true
---
Since how many months u play?
---
[And then there's this](https://youtu.be/RDL0sIfKssc)
---
Rule 63 artists: looks like im about to break the law
---
Maybe it‚Äôs considered theft, and you probably will have to refund at some point or face penalties
---
I'm not mad, just disappointed :(
---
Happened to me just yesterday
---
I'm gonna have to side with u/ULTIMATE-THE-UNKNOWN on this one. Rank 30s and 25+ are not luck, it's skill. Also, if you lose to a 22k just accept the fact that you lost to a pro player. There's no shame in admitting defeat to someone with 22 thousand trophies
---
She‚Äôs only 30 tho, colors go nicely
---
It might be crow
---
**Wait Why-**
---
I think it‚Äôs kinda fast, considering you have to control your joystick in order for him to hit enemies.
---
The only reason he knew my email is because we were doing a project together on his device, and. A slideshow was on my account. I did not have my device there so I had to sign in with my email on his device. After, I apparently forgot to log out which is how he got into my email
---
Leons be like:
---
It's free real state.
---
THEY ARE BROTHER AND SISTER
---
Skins are a waste
---
I think you are right because there are the crow's knives in the el primo part
---
This is more op than badlnd aid shelly coiled snake mortis snappy sniping piper and pocos screeching solo all combined togther when they first released
---
F and How?
---
HE ATTAC
---
HE PROTEC
---
BUT FIRST OF ALL
---
HE REALLY CUTE
---
It‚Äôs a bit different for each brawler depending on how much base Heath they have.
---
It‚Äôs possible too. Cheap gems might be a scam.
---
thanks for the heads up my main man
---
Dude Shelly got nerfed and now she's at the bottom of the meta again ): if u don't know how to handle a Shelly it doesn't mean she needs a nerf, so plz stop with this shit, stop harassing other Shelly, or any other brawler
---
I dig it
---
1 nothing can be as broken as that lol 
---
2 what about him is broken
---
Ty :)
---
And my classmate got Sandy at 932 trophies.And he is not pay to win.
---
eventually the one bush she didn't check will be full of bulls
---
my brother bought a pack of gems and coins for ~$40 on my account and used it so I asked for a refund, they gave it to me, and then took it back in gems
---
No I used a gift card
---
crow can chase you anywhere and literally blocks your regeneration for something that feels like forever... why the fuck isn't he top tier too?
---
Dude you have uploaded like ten of these now in a row
---
Your not a clown your the entire circus
---
Like no way to enter? How about the community managers? Did they help?
---
Shid i have to put my phone to charge UhH...WHAT YOU HAVEN'T PLAYED TUBER SIMULATOR? YOU KNOW ITS FUN RIGHR. WELL I WILL CUT YOU A DEA. ITS FOR FREE AND THATS A GREAT PRICE! k im out
---
I didn‚Äôt ask for a refund
---
Yeah I think 65536 is the limit before it overflows
---
Is that your own skin idea?
---
This is probably the first cool brawler concept I've seen. To top it all off, the art is good too!
---
Well done!
---
I‚Äôm sorry but your mortis at the beginning of the video has 460 trophy‚Äôs and at the end 454üòÖ
---
r/killthecameraman
---
Stolen From a privete server
---
to me, sandy looks 14-ish and nita looks 9
---
paul plz
---
The problem is that I used a gift card...
---
also where would yall put sandy?
---
He had 461 when it ended, 454 was the trophies I had when the game started, I won 7.
---
Where does everyone get those brawler icons?
---
Plz tell me where you got that leon icon
---
You meant stolen skin from Lwarb's beta
---
Stolen From a privete serever
---
Well no shit. Who's gonna record for hours when they can just record a few small clips.
---
Wdym?
---
They literally asking you to pay. wtf
---
I want spike so bad! I got Tara but they should call her Tarable because MAN she always feel so weak. I've put a lot of work into practicing too
---
I mean good luck convincing someone with that
---
No I have not this was through gift card
---
See you in hot!
---
Wait are you the official supercell?
---
Not sure if I like or not this post üòÇ
---
I think apple accidentally refunded your purchase that was meant for someone else and the money also went to the other person. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs supercells fault I would contact apple about it
---
Can confirm. I have been playing since about 6 months before global and am nowhere near having enough gold. Its because the p2p youtubers spend money on boxes even if they'll mostly get gold (they already have all the powerpoints and brawlers) so they end up with tons of gold.

---
From when is El Rudo Primo  80 gems?! I bought it for 30 gems  like a week ago......
---
Nice concept! I would definitely recommend cutting the super damage back a lot. For example, this does nearly 4x the damage as el primos super does. An alternative solution would be to have the charge up be very slow
---
What about a payload type game mode where one team has to push a bomb or something to an enemy team's safe?
---
r/shittybrawlstars r/youngpeoplebrawlstars
---
Opens a grocery bag and uses the stuff inside as weapons!
---
It based on the amount of kill
---
Brawl ball: kill
---
Heist: most damage
---
Bounty: most kill
---
Siege: most damage
---
Oh my god, it's so flashy and nearly impossible to watch without looking away through the end! But I'm impressed by the amount of effort this community has put into making that clip! I think "hundreds of contributions" is a highly underrated statement and should be instead "thousands of contributions", since the game is global.
---
No cause leon can go anywhere but sandy has an area.
---
Yes, but It's inconsistent. Just a small detail that looks bad once you start noticing it. I mean, if it was like the other classes, would it look worse?
---
Yeah dude sure, im a shitty human for expecting normal english ( im not a native speaker )
---
Ya
---
Overused joke. Also r/shittybrawlstars
---
20? It's just 100 gems man
---
umm no. mortis sucks against tanks and shellies. brawl ball is literally filled  with them.if you want to runs mortis, you can't hop in with randoms.  first thing you need is rico/colt/spike/8bit etc. tank killers. dribbling alone won't win you games.
---
Hey just saw someone else do it before
---
Shouldn't it be 'of' Sandy?
---
very legendary*
---
Thats an allowed and these upcoming fewüóøüíéüÖ±

Ok will do

Tnx man. Thank you so much.

At least you have 1 üòÇ

Actually it gets stale if you play it. It looks nice but Mecha bo is better.

Huge thanks to supercell for making such an amazing community event and giving us the chance to spread our creativity with the whole community! I did frame 97 (the one after the minecraft penny lol). I'm hoping for more amazing community events in the future. Thanks once again and congratulations to all the other participants that got featured :3
---
Don't even click on their video, it counts as a view which makes it more likely to be recommended to you and other people.
---
2nd panel. Intentional spelling?
---
So?
---
What do you think it's better to buy? Sandy and 350 power to level her up or mega offer with gold and 10 megaboxes? I'm on the way to 10k trophies and have all brawlers except Leon, Gene, Spike and Sandy. Most others are at least level 6-7-8
---
Thanks in advance
---
A "pumpkin spike latte" if you will
---
I have both a Brawl Theory, and another acapella brawl song video in the works ;) Did someone official say that they're not part of a family together? Sandy totally looks related to Tara if you ask me!
---
Downvote this guy
---
Damn youre right, my bad, iddnt see that.
---
Besides do you know what an integer overflow is
---
What could I be doing wrong? üò≠üò≠
---
Have my upvote for the facing worlds refference. I still play UT99 even after 20 years since it has been released.
---
I support all the brawl gangs! (mostly I'm just afraid of getting bull-ied)
---
To be honest she‚Äôs not a noob anymore i would call her elite your too good at the game love both of you &lt;3
---
Hey Kairos! First of all I just want to let you know that I have not missed a brawler Olympics...and it's because it actually makes players so much better at the game. I know there are a lot of us more competitive players that utilize your informative videos, so on behalf of us thank you for spending alot of time and effort on them!
---
I'm curious from a more successful brawlstars content creators perspective: "What do you think the best way to enter the scene is?"
---
We are at the point where there are staple creators that are now part of supercells communication list. There is also an up and coming pro scene but not that much information out on it as we are waiting for the first ever World Championship!
---
I'm curious if you think this game will follow a more common esports background and the pro players will devolve into the streamers/content creators, or if hopping right into the YouTube as bottom tier still seems feasable?
---
Plz keep on ticking away Cara‚úåÔ∏è
---
True I saved over a hundred boxes and only got a star power
---
no homor

Why not 100.000? Saves you asking every everytime.

Don‚Äôt worry! I‚Äôm the leader of r/RosaGanf, we‚Äôll protect you from those meanies üòÇ

Who?

I may do a rework soon, would you like it?

My frame got into the video but I didn't get a reward? My tag was in the submission, its #CRG9CYG would appreciate the gems please.
---
Doing SO good! Thanks for your support!
---
*angry trans noises*
---
The poster
---
I made it before she came out so... But I may do a reworked version soon, would you like it?
---
shut up trans
---
r/shittybrawlstars
---
Ill make a new post about it
---
Kairos im a random redditer and a brawler. I would like to know what was the reason of you playing mobile games (brawl stars) and not other gaming platforms?
---
That is so cute
---
How do you even get 22 brawl stars notifications
---
Yeah I'll change it in my rework.
---
Hello, Kairos.
---
It's been a while since you updated the Brawlimpics series.
---
Any chance you update it now, since there are so many new brawlers?
---
Cheers.
---
Ah okay, so I am on the right path. I just need to play for longer intervals. Thanks.
---
I would absolutely love this, much better than ball.
---
I may adds some walls then
---
How much of a fan are you of the weekend ticket events? which one is your favorite? Least favorite?
---
Good one i made it too
---
Martydom:

Drop Tick's head when killed

---
I'm a CS major, you're a kid born in 2005. Integer overflow is such a simple concept, there's no need to google that to know you're wrong.
---
As someone who likes Twitch a lot more than YouTube, but wants each to be successful, what do you recommend I do to grow my community? Also I have an ectremely hard time motivating myself to edit videos, so my upload schedule isnt existant. How could I fix that?
---
I definitely plan on doing it! And yes, she really is *that* bad at brawl stars...
---
Thats really good idea! I want it!
---
Thank you so much. It is the best support I can get.
---
That's 120 or 60 dollars right there
---
Other than the Sandy who is the best legendarie brawling?
---
Thanks guys for the great opportunity you gave to the community to show off their talent and creativity in Drawing! It was truly fun and Amazing when people across the world get together to colour each frame and create such an amazing Animation. creates a strong bond between the team and Community!üòç I Really, REALLY Wish we'll have more of these and maybe more bigger projects, more people will come together to unleash their inner creativity. Also the frame 27 deserves an applauseü§£
---
Weird question (it is an ask me ANYTHING) but are you a mormon? if not what religion? And is you religion the reason you named your channel Kairos(God‚Äôs Time)?
---
Whoms the most OP brawler in the game currently?
---
Not really. First of all, in brawl ball the ball is always in the middle of the arena, the objective is to put it on the enemy's arch and you can always throw it. Meanwhile, in capture the flag, the flags are always on the enemy's bases which are on two opposite sides of the screen, the objective is to get the flag and then ran all the way back to your own base, which means that the two teams could have eachothers flags and go a race against the clock so you can get it on your base before the enemy; and lastly, you can't throw a damn flag.
---
playing PEDIR PARAR ENVAR
---
Dont say that üòÇ
---
Can you tell me more about the unbalanced ones?
---
loving the amount of effort you put in every post,, i hope supercell notices you
---
You made the meme?
---
As a suggestion to improve them? Personally I think they're fine the way they are. If you follow my method to maxing out your account, you should get more than half of your Star Powers for free from boxes by the time your account is maxed.
---
How willing would you be to play with viewers? I watch your content every update to know everything, I have 13k trophies and have been playing since beta days but just casually.
---
Awesome, I love those videos! Also, One of the lead artist on twitter said they are not a family, but they got the ‚Äúsun, moon, and star‚Äù theme right. Maybe they are related like that and not exactly as family.
---
Thank youüòä but they will both get nerfed in my upcoming reworked version
---
i dont like where this is going
---
Yeah, because it's challenging and requires strategy, which is what makes it fun.
---
Nice job. Can u do one for the el primo skins?
---
Could be an idea for a 4th star powersüòâ
---
Oh I saw it, sorry for kinda reposting :(
---
Thanks! ^ - ^
---
Getting to 500 was easy back then, too.
---
HahahahahahahaüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
‚ÄúNew‚Äù game mode idea... yet most people have thought of this and even youtubers have talked about this kind of game mode
---
I love Siege so much! I know I'm in the minority but it's SUCH a fun mode! My favorite map is Junk Park, and my favorite brawler to play is Penny on that map. Such easy wins
---
Should be crow and spike only :,)
---
Alright,still thank you for the support
---
One long session, but he only recorded every ‚Äúmatch end‚Äù screen.
---
If you had to live in a different country where would you chose
---
Not necessarily they could have gotten some ez money form small tourneys
---
What tactics would you reccomend in showdown? (Im at 3.5k trophies)
---
Just save 350 or 450 gems... Legendary Brawlers on sale cost that much.
---
You can miss your super, it auto-refills. But if you don't miss it. It gets reset. He has a special ability bar
---
Well i want you to know the health system on brawl stars is dependent on 16-bit number that only go up to 65k, which means when you collect that 150th powercube dependent on that brawlers health at your level, will cause it to overflow crashing the game, i already know about integer overflow, i watch youtube for a living...
---
Fair enough! Keep it up
---
But they're already implemented in game if you look at the brawl boxes drop chance stats and look at your star power drop chances
---
Why mortis?
---
I got my first and unique legendary at 4.500 trophies. ;-;
---
I cannot use spike. Crow is probably the best legendary with leon close behind.
---
Hell yeah, that looks amazing
---
I may do a reworked version soon, would you like it?
---
I even liked your idea! Listen,to make the map bigger press above the event list,it should say size,then click or press large square. Its quite big but thats a showdown map size. Please remake it or maybe ill try finish it off myself and give you the full map and credit.
---
Personally I didn't feel that much hype for the new brawler, Sandy is awesome but I won't be getting him for a very long time due to it being a legendary, so my question is, do you think there should be more ways to unlock legendaries apart from chests (for example like the challenges in clash Royale) and if yes, how would you implement it?
---
Stolen!! This is DEFINITELY NOT his own art, don't upvote!! Reddit age 0 days. Look at my latest post to find out more
---
Love it

Oops. Forgot about it ;)
---
How you doing cara simon? :)

_Ah yes ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)_

I dont think you were spposed to change stuff up

4992 is not a while

I can see them together.

Thank youüòâ follow me to stay tuned if you want
---
Same here
---
r/mortisgang approves
---
What is something you want to accomplish in your life?
---
I think Colt is a pretty well balanced brawler with his star powers, but without them he is not that much balanced. Does he need a buff? (not a star power buff) or Does Rico needs a nerf, cause Rico is really an alternative for Colt. It is Colt but with more damage but less health
---
Have you watched the following Anime?:

1. Fullmetal Alchemist (Both)- which one do you like better and why??

5. The Seven Deadly Sins

Yes, I am The same guy who asked you about Anime in the Twitch Stream (The one in which you push Sandy to 700 in LONE STAR on Thousand Lakes)
---
We got 8-bit
---
Mr Cara Simon,what would your dream job be?(beside youtube)
---
How many trophy are your wife in Brawler Stars?
---
Haha it might be about time that I come up with something else that would be even more entertaining
---
Bruh am level 127 with 1 legendary
---
moonwalk to victory
---
inb4 post is in hot!
---
great art btw im in love
---
I seriously hope we get a 5v5 mode some day.
---
Which is your favourite movie
---
Could you do more vids that feature people on this sub? Like brawler concepts (I have multiple), gamemode ideas, skins, etc. Big fan btw, keep doing what you do!
---
When I was around 8k I got my first mythic. Trust me when I say mythics and leggies aren't awesome. They all have unique mechanism, but aren't broken. I have all but 2 leggies, but I will say that I enjoy Rico much more than the mythics and leggies. I would also go on and say that all the mythics feel weak, except probably gene.
---
The game?
---
Hope you get your missing brawler/brawlers soon
---
Piper
---
When are you going to make Who kills the boss the fastest video? :)
---
PS I know it's gonna be a lot of work with new brawlers and starpowers
---
PSS I luv ur vids :)
---
Who is your least favourite brawler to play yourself / play against?
---
Hi Kairos. Do you agree Supercell should add expiriance road and to add a free legendary at like 10000 or 14500. This will make players wanna push more and play the game.
---
This died in new, u/MrInfinity80 you can repost this if you want.
---
Ikr lol
---
If you were a brawler what rarity would you be
---
Relatable
---
got leon at 3k or something. crow at 8k and spike in 11k or whatever. all our of brawl boxes. now im just missing sandy then ill have 29/29
---
Hmmm lemme try
---
What did you eat for lunch yesterday? Was it the fake sand?
---
Can you give me Sandy
---
Check he video and crow it down to see
---
Since when do you play Brawl Stars and why?
---
r/youbrokethechain
---
Do you ever plan to do other games in addition to brawlstars
---
I agree it‚Äôs not even hard
---
Please post your Streaming Schedule and also try to Stream on YouTube
---
KONO DIO DA!
---
To be completely honest, I have very little experience with podcasts so I feel inadequate to answer the question. However, Brawl Stars has the youngest player base out of all Supercell games so my guess is that it would do worst as far as podcasts are concerned. I think Clash Royale would do the best because of it's older playerbase
---
Stop advertising
---
true
---
I do! Today it was peanut butter captain crunch haha
---
Hi kairos what's your favorite skin also can you help me push one day
---
In some ways, aren't we all joe?
---
No one cares
---
Thats a good idea but i think its op
---
You were at 6 million trophies?
---
Mobile ads be like
---
kairos do you have heart?
---
Haha no they're not. That's just what we call them on YouTube to help protect their identity
---
Do you think legendarys are to hard to get?
---
I feel sorry for the players in that game they must have gotten actual aids from you. But great plays ngl
---
Thanks for the suggestions! I'm always looking for a good anime!
---
I got my first epic at 6k lol
---
But did they about Pam's turret or 8 bit's?
---
What brawler were you most excited to come out for
---
Haha if you watched to about 4 minutes in the video, you'd find that I switched the real sand with edible sand mostly made from graham cracker haha
---
imagine the crate depression but in brawl stars and you only get legendary brawlers, oh god that would be the worst thing ever
---
Kairos do you enjoy making videos?
---
Who said I have Leon?
---
Dude didn't come to defeat the boss, he became the boss
---
What do you think is the biggest problem with brawl stars and how do you think it could be fixed?
---
Yep it's pretty dope
---
Probably another Tank since Tick is a thrower, 8-bit is a sharpshooter, and Sandy is basically an assassin
---
Thank you so much!
---
Says the robot that has 2 skins
---
Which brawler do you think is the most overpowered at the moment in the casual meta and what makes them so good?
---
Thank you very much! I play with my viewers on almost every livestream on Twitch!
---
Min 27 still no Brawler In the brushes
---
Hey Kairos! I‚Äôm curious, what is the process you take in making your tier list videos? Is there some sort of discussion, or perhaps it‚Äôs as simple as a vote?
---
Only OJ has mastered it
---
Do you have a genuine free to play mini account?
---
 If yes, what do you think about the free to play progression?
---
I'm at 15K with only spike......AND I HAD TO BUY HIM
---
Epic, nearly every other 150 gem skin has something different, except for this one
---
i mean most game rounds will never last more than 5 minutes so
---
Why did u censor the no no word?
---
this is beyond legendary
---
I pushed 8-Bit to 750 with randoms. It's not super impressive, but I was surprised at how easy it was to do it with randoms haha
---
As everyone knows, you know what's in an update before it releases, but do you get early news about the update a few days before or when exactly?
---
I know that it's at least a week, because in a video where you, Lex and OJ played together, OJ said the following words: "Can we show the new Bo skin?" This was 1.5 weeks before the "Robo Update" (you know, when those cool robot skins came into the game).
---
So could you tell me, when you exactly get the first infos about an update and if you are involved in the making of it (do you like it, what do you want to see in it, idea for a new brawler and so on)? üòé
---
Sounds great man! Looks like I got to catch a couple streams of yours.
---
TBH it's leon and he is easy to push but good joob
---
I like the idea!
---
Why is your creator link not working? It‚Äôs saying ‚ÄúCode invalid or expired‚Äù
---
What kind of new brawler mechanic would you like to see in the game
---
I am at 18 k and i have only 1 legebdary i opened 80 box today and i got ONLY Band-Aid for shelly (my account is MAX 26/29)
---
I think the golden mecha bo &amp; crow skins are too expensive because I want more exclusive skins for all the brawlers, but I don't want it to take more than 29 years for a semi-casual player to unlock them all
---
Leon is LITELARY DIO
---
AND TICK IS LITELARY KILLER QUEEN!
---
What do you think the next brawler be? And do you have any tips for Lone Star?
---
I certainly try to!
---
nah, it's just a fanart (((((((
---
It's called sarcasm dude, never heard of it?
---
Expeditor
---
are you teaming with your name sir
---
It‚Äôs amazing. However I don‚Äôt have epilepsy and I think I still had a seizure.
---
Stolen.
---
Upgrading Magnum Special would be op
---
Tara also black
---
Everyone should shut the f up cuz they were friends they invited each other
---
r/blursedbrawlstars
---
This is a good idea üëç
---
If you think you can play aggressively with mortis in showdown, then clearly you aren‚Äôt a good player. Any player with a good amount of trophies can destroy mortis lmao. You act like there‚Äôs still a skill curve with his jukes, even though they implemented auto aim and destroyed that viable skill.
---
For real though we need a [compilation ](https://youtu.be/RDL0sIfKssc)
---
Do you really enjoy playing free for all game modes, specifically solo showdown, despite how incredibly how unfair they most of the time are?
---
[Yeeeeeee](https://youtu.be/RDL0sIfKssc)
---
Why do you never do robo rumble videos the meta actually changes in the mode and all you tubers do is tell you to play it but not how! By the way you are the best brawl stars you tuber for strategy
---
Proof is in his profile, it's a troll account
---
Imma remember u that brawl ball isn‚Äôt unlocked on this amount of trophies or earlier. All these ‚ÄúMatchmaking issues‚Äù are just players playing with their noob friends, I don‚Äôt understand how other people STILL don‚Äôt get it.
---
I KNOW RIGHT
---
Yeah he just dont know
---
That's not feminine attire
---
Is your name Cara Simon?
---
Piper sniper him ü§£üë±üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
There is nothing special about that comment. What is it?
---
*Crows future remodel*
---
Uh why tf do you have like 8 power 10 brawlers that aren‚Äôt even 300 trophies?
---
Viva os BR!
---
Lex is your dad?
---
Say Nice right now
---
Thanks so much for your reply! Wish you the best of luck with your career!
---
Sometimes I play again ... It was one of my favorite games
---
No,Tiger Nita.
---
wait it downvoted? i though some internet heroes are going to downvote me because i said that autists drawing is bad.
---
Can you do a tier list where you don't take star powers into consideraition?
---
Can you give me tips for piper in lone star?
---
No its dumb
---
Is there a chance that there might be something like a Story Mode? Because you know, We always play in-real-time people, and which is usually fun. So maybe a little chance?
---
now I feel less bad about not getting him with 0.23%
---
Agreed
---
Upvote so super cell adds this
---
Well I have one legendary and I‚Äôm at 10k so what?
---
Dude, the comment is edited. So this literally couldve been edited 5 minutes before you took the screenshot.
---
A tick doesn't get to decide which mortis skin is better
---
Sometimes I play again ... It was one of my favorite games ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
What a bad photoshop
---
How many hours would you say you be played brawl stars for in total ? :)
---
They are not in a party..bcoz nita left first
---
One problem with Takedown right now is that the boss wanders off to the edges of the map quite frequently, forcing brawlers are unlucky to respawn far away have to walk almost the whole map.
---
My suggestion is the creation of a ‚Äúbinding zone‚Äù for the boss in the middle. The boss would still be able to walk out of it, but if it ever stopped to dash/shoot laser, it would dash back into the zone instead.
---
This way the boss would stay closer to the middle of the map, where all spawn points can reach it without too much walking.
---
She sound british though
---
r/technicallythetruth
---
Not first but good mortis first was YDE
---
You sure about that?
---
Is not fotoshop, I don‚Äôt even have a computer... :,(
---
I got another one: Remember the map on the Brawl Theory? What if there is actually a kingdom and Piper coming from there?
---
Nah bruh. This is real: https://youtu.be/skCBGAVIjWw
---
üòë
---
I like it
---
From what I know, If you were to unlock every brawler but a legendary, your legendary brawler probability drop for a period of time. However, The max probability for legendary brawlers has increased. So over time the probability will increase past the previous max. You and this post are correct, just want to eliminate confusion.
---
From now on I will add boxes and I will also use other themes for showdown. Thanks again
---
Myn account posts here on reddit
---
What is your opinion on barley right now?
---
Thanks!
---
Well, it helped her close the distance between low hp brawlers wich made her extra scary. It was nerfed so it wouldn't overshadow her other star power.
---
 How do you do this?
---
Woah u must have put a lot of effort into this rly good idea tho
---
When bibis trailer came out many ppl including me looked masculinity
---
Sandy doesn't have feminists characteristics either but no masculinity either
---
Sadly I lost the map but its fine,I learnt a lot from it
---
Which mode is the best to push this high?
---
Nice try:)

Amazing! Looking forward to more of these! :)

8k

Well what do u think now that they helped the ftp players out im a ftp player and i personally love the balance changes/ trophies and star points rework
---
That‚Äôs a lame reason to nerf something though. If the other SP isn‚Äôt good enough they should buff it. I‚Äôd prefer a buff to that SP and some general nerf to Bibi as a whole if that‚Äôs what was needed.
---
What you said about it helping her close in is why it was so great. It completely changed her playstyle. Without it she‚Äôs just another bush camper, which is not something I enjoy.
---
Umm... ok? Let‚Äôs pretend I saw nothing
---
And darryl
---
This would be amazing.
---
I like this map and I honestly feel it has a chance to win!
---
Too much extra detail
---
What were your favourite things about Finland and Helsinki when you went there? I'm from Helsinki so it would fun to hear.
---
The token doublers for 50 gems are worth more than the 60gem mega box deal
---
personally i push brawlball  cause it‚Äôs my fav but prob gem or bounty
---
i like brawlball but honestly gem or bounty is better
---
I don't think. This Star Power would be more unbalanced than the other
---
vai se fuder sparky

Wow I actually didnt notice this on blue version, only on red one.

Por que :v

I was thinking the same thing

Was just making a joke about your interesting name, not attempting to make a jab. Also, I don't want to buy hay, I don't own a horse.
---
can relate i got 10th everytime with 0 stars cause everyone steals my kills
---
Thanks for letting me know your opinion
---
I was about to say that, lol
---
Yes but you cant get to it unless breaking the wall
---
Cause frank hits the hammer to the ground not at the enemies
---
HES 80 GEMS NOW?! WOW THANK GOD I GOT HIM FOR 30
---
eyes eyes eyes
---
ye but aomeone with power 10 characters
---
Shelly's and Leons are everywhere
---
Hi guys, Tara here to explain the joke. So basically, in the newest supercell video, there was a lot of flashing lights and colors. So thats why if you watched it, even for a short times, your eyes would hurt. (Btw they even put an epilepsy warning in th start of the video)
---
Idk because maybe one time I actually make a good map but someone steals it. Lately thats what I have seen in reddit
---
Yikes
---
Thank you Captain üë®‚Äç‚úàÔ∏è
---
This post got in so many directions
---
Bit in brawl ball he‚Äôs not
---
i love lone star it's a really fun mode with all of it's problems
---
Disagree he can be extremely good if u use him right
---
Ayeee you got me! Congrats!
---
Very nice
---
:)
---
I didn't expect that! I still needed Leon and Spike
---
It‚Äôs so true lol I call it bulls natural habitat
---
You‚Äôll have to aim manually
---
That‚Äôs the only way you‚Äôll be able to improve, auto-aim works early on but it is not reliable when you start facing better players.
---
Fair enough lol
---
This was such an obnoxious and loud way of conveying you want emotes and skin colours. Yikes.
---
Schooling me today eh? XD
---
We only need feminism and comunism, and this game would become Joseph Stalin's favourite game, Left Stars.
---
Happens to me but with Mortis
---
I used El Primo for 40% of the time (which is also the best Brawler I have) and I didn't need to
---
considering most heavy weights consist of just getting close and punching them, yeah no need to aim
---
It should be siege. Anything but brawl ball, it's the worst gamemode by far.
---
Definitely a good idea. 150 gems for no fx is pretty big bs
---
Dou thats It so cool bro
---
Love the idea
---
Not even close.
---
im getting flashbacks of the almighty classic
---
###RAN RAN RUUUUUU
---
This concept was a competition for fun with a prize that everyone has a chance to get, if the team considered his submission funny enough to make it in then I dont see the problem. You could argue that "he stole the place of an actually good submission" but its not like this is the only bad one, I think it was clever sarcasm even if it was just a troll or someone genuinely thought it would be a good idea
---
Am I missing something?
---
The account is new, so the person made a new account just for this
---
Advice from me make his star awake

Bruh, I can make scribbles like that, where‚Äôs my 100 gems?

Ew i hate you

Get out.

Cool! It looks like Electris from Monsters of Etheria (Roblox)

Irrelevant but ok

Congrats man

Allow me to serenade you sometime

Thank you ;)

Heyy, someone gave you gold!

That‚Äôs instagram for you

Read my explanation. It's the biggest comment here.

There's no point, you can only do it in friendly.....

Brock is black, and Rosa is also black, but with a British accent.

Ouch, spike‚Äôs fucking hurt

And a cactus. Don't forget the cactus.

I don‚Äôt even care what they are classified as

Yes, thank u ;)

It's sooo bad. I'm on 28mbps WiFi and it can barely play. Only rocket league has servers this bad, out of the hundreds of games I've played.
---
opened 51 and 3 boxes and got noooothing
---
Congrats!
---
Thanks Supercell! Already used my gems to buy the Robo Mike skin I wanted since the Summer of the robots update üòÄ
---
Removed. Keep your post titles descriptive and provide context. Additionally do not use low effort/all caps/clickbait titles.
---
You're wrong. Give up on it.
---
Maybe on end screen?
---
Piper: I've got a lot of letters
---
Jessie: alot? I only got 6
---
Shelly: i bareley got 3
---
Pam: you guys are getting letters?
---
Most of them were poorly made
---
Same for me :)
---
Got an extra 0 in there
---
send n00d$
---
ok :(
---
Interesting...
---
Why 320, such a specific number
---
Leon needs a rework imo, not a nerf. If there's a leon it basically means random death, and there's nothing you can do about it.
---
Another YouTuber who is a Hat-er, uh?
---
I had a random Piper on my team (power 2)
---
And i was a 8-bit, the other guy was a Rico, i got 4:55, I consider that good since i had a Piper on my team
---
You played sooo bad.
---
Might sound weird, but if they don't play at all, they wouldn't destroy walls which would actually help out the other teammates. The walls help filter the bots and a person like El Primo, which I played in that match, can hit through more than one enemy. Also when they AFK for too long the game kicks them out and a bit replaces them which I would much rather take over a person that trolls.
---
However, I agree with the brain dead players. They are worse than bots.
---
English?
