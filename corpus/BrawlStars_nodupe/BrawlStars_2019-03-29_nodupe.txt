If you mean a flying character that flies purely as a design choice, sure, but if you mean a character that can only be attacked by specific characters like in clash royale, that‚Äôs a big no no.
---
---
---
If it‚Äôs end game content. USE COINS. 
---
It is still paying for extra trophies. Just.. NO!!!
---
definitely still ok. fighting for that first box and she just keeps bouncing her shots off the box into you... ugh

That doesn't roll off the tongue

Glad you like it x3

Im not looking for it to sound better to me üòÇ Im tryna help you avoid potential outrage since people get sensitive these days (i.e. Robert Downey in Tropic Thunder, cultural appropriarion, etc.) but ok skin still looks good
---
Its F2P because you dont need money to be good at this game. It has inapp purchases because they need to make money. I'm saying you don't need to spend money on the game to be goof and you would be stupid if you did. 
---
this is false because at 0 trophies you cant get siege

Your Brook was stronger.

I will lose a lot of trophies on this map;(

pisses me off when carl decides to use his super in brawl ball when the enemy team is trying to score

Well, at least you're honest, take my upvote.

Sounds delicious

Again. at 0 trophies you cant get siege

Okay the price will get higher if get many brawler and trophies

She was a monster when she was released. She could literally 1 shot a ricochet form across the map. He doesn't have to be on the screen and hes dead

Bull is good in heist and siege. In siege he can take the IKE out by himself, definetly his best mode imo.
---
He probably suck as well
---
Thank you for the tip

Well then I am trying to make it sound better to those people haha. If people want to feel outraged by this much I let them be, it's seriously nothing serious, I am not really worried about this :) I appreciate the compliment though, thanks ;)

Dude Leon and Nita are around the same age.

Can confirm

Ty I got the crow to 502 trophies

I just cringed

i refuse to play 3v3 at all now cause i tilted 300 trying to get 1 token

I have penny

Thx for telling me üëç I guess I won‚Äôt put up things like this anymore I just thought it was cool

Yay I‚Äôm not alone

I can't understand this shit
---
He kills by spinning
---
Mind changed
---
Kine master is a video editing app
---
Primo and bull doesn't even need skill all they have to do is auto aiming but it's still possible,
---
I don't try this against bull but primo is bit easier yet you end up drying many times but sometimes you got to try something to stop those bullies

Tara's mind: ohhh shi....
---
honestly thought that pipers super was too predictable - once you know where shes going, you just had to wait for her to land. A super like this would add unpredictability to her movement, which means that she would be more likely to get away to a safer spot 
---
It is the mecca of beauty 
---
This is ironic... I always lose 3v3s when there is a Korean on my time. I can‚Äôt stand playing with them because every time I see one on my team, I know I‚Äôm going to lose. Please ban Koreans

They‚Äôre in a team

What if your opponent is also skilled though???

Just needs fire rate buff, that's all

You know what else is

Hmmmmmmmmmü§î

Anytime I see a Mortis on my team, I mentally prepare myself to lose trophies so the let down at the end is not too bad...but when said Mottos has Korean characters...I know I just got Dante from Devil May Cry to carry me for the easiest win of my life.

Hello from Crows Hideout 
---
You‚Äôre 100% on that. No one will ever know his financial state or intentions, and is no ones business, really. But usually, a maxed or nearly maxed out account would have many more trophies. This is just an anomaly I found when I was bored and decided to share.
---
My hopes for the game mode Basket Brawl just went down the toilet...
---
Like, no no? Or just, y'know, no.
---
I mean thats  most of the brawlers
---
If you're playing Heist and you choose Crow, pls die.
---
I never said i auto aim piper i only said i auto aim her super
---
Because it was different from other mods
---
Others spawns thing and life leech passively affects you 
---
This is SO CUTE!!
---
Can u link me to the format
---
This looks sick!! Can i recreate this in photoshop and make it look professional ill include u in the credits :)
---
can you explain what the gaps are?
---
Unbalanced. The middle gives advantages for one of the teams :/
---
Joke's on you, I already got cancer!
---
Haha, very true lmao
---
Carl's definitely not one of the weakest, though I do think he deserves a small buff.
---
IMO Shelly, Piper, and Crow are the characters that NEED buffs 
---
Looks like the Shelly paid to lose.

I want gene so bad

BRAWLER CONCEPT Before anyone asks, yes I know it kinda sucks, first time drawing In years and first original character. She's a flamingo who was left as a chick and found/raised by crow (hence her edginess and jacket). Her attack: a kick that pushes enemies back. Medium health High Damage and fast. Her super's a double kick, the first one deals decent damage and the second pushes them back much further than her normal attack. I was bored and it was 1am dont judge too hard. Any extra ideas for attack or super or star power would be amazing! 
---
That means we will get a HUGE update next time.
---
Everyone has their tastes. I, for one, HATE Bounty. Gives me PTSD of playing TDM in COD vs clans were everyone just hides for the entire match.
---
the jacket
---
This would be fun until you hit a powerline
---
Then maybe unlock the feature once that brawler itself has 300 trophies or something like that
---

But he can change it

Ik my point being they have different appeals, he didn't steal anything. He took a concept for a game that neither of you own, and arguably made it better. What he did still took skill and effort. It would b different if he just re uploaded the picture.

---
I like it
---
It‚Äôs not that serious
---
Cool idea!
---
That's how mafia works
---
Ok seems lit
---
yeah it‚Äôs true once you actually get bull to rank 15, he becomes almost unplayable in showdown unless you camp and box steal or team. i have managed to get him to rank 15 solely by playing heist, and i have gotten every brawler to rank 15 except for carl, gene, and darryl (just unlocked the first two and darryl is impossible) what game modes can i play darryl in cuz he is absolutely awful in every one imo
---
Perfection
---
The only guys who could defeat thanos with all stones
---
I agree and disagree.
---
Crow needs a change in order to be viable, a rework at least. 
---
The reason crow is considered the worst brawler and needs a buff/rework is based on a variety of issues.
---
1. All his counters are strong and in the meta: Pam, Nita, Jessie, Spike, Leon are all widely considered to be strong brawlers and all 5 of them will usually beat Crow, even Leon who Crow is supposed to counter with his poison and long range has an advantage because of his speed which allows him to match Crow‚Äôs and his raw power.
---
2. He isn‚Äôt specialized: Crow, like Gene, is very well rounded but struggles to excel in any gamemode when some brawlers like Piper at least have 1 mode where they are uncontested, Pam and other top tier brawlers are consistently going to overpower crow in almost every gamemode. Crow and Gene both need to be reworked so they‚Äôll have a clear specialization that will allow them to overpower another brawler in at least 2 or 3 gamemodes without needing a huge buff to stats. 
---
3. He‚Äôs weak: if you play him right you can push trophies just fine, but that doesn‚Äôt mean he is strong, this game is pretty balanced so every brawler can be pushed to a certain trophy level, but that doesn‚Äôt mean Crow is fine where he is. 
---
4. He actually can‚Äôt push trophies that well: I said above that any brawlers can be pushed to a certain level, but because of meta and unbalanced brawlers that actually isn‚Äôt true. 
---
If you average the trophy levels of the top 200 or so players for every brawler crow falls into 20th place, or around that area at least. This means that Crow, despite your hardest efforts, won‚Äôt win consistently enough to push really high, even on maps that favor him.
---
Now to summarize the points I‚Äôve listed above.
---
Crow has no specialization, gets countered by the meta, has low stats(which I admit wouldn‚Äôt be a problem if he had a specialization) and cannot push as high as most other brawlers. 
---
People have wanted a Crow buff for a long time because he has been weak for as long as Pam has been strong, while some brawlers like darryl have sneaked up into the top 3 every other balance change the same cluster of brawlers (Pam, Nita, Jessie, Penny, Barley, Spike, Leon) have been meta for way too long and a major shift is needed to push Crow‚Äôs good matchups like Dynamike, Tara, and Piper into the top 5, and for brawlers like Leon and Spike to be reworked or nerfed so Crow can counter them like he should. Brawlers that counter Crow like Pam and Nita should be nerfed to lower their usage rate while still maintaining their ability to counter Crow otherwise he‚Äôd be too strong. If all of these changes are made along with a few I won‚Äôt name we could see a fresh new meta featuring Piper, Crow, Tara, Bo (a potential Crow counter) Barley, Dynamike, and maybe even Mortis again to counter the throwers, Crow would be a strong brawler in this mega simply because he has good matchups against a lot of the strongest brawlers like Tara and the Throwers, he may not even need a direct buff to his stats at all. 
---
So In conclusion.
---
No we should not buff crow, just flip the rest of roster upside down and he‚Äôll be used.
---
The spawn protection was added in the penny/Frank update as a quality of life feature. And yes this did stop the pipers. Thank god
---
It is crow's 
---
Poor boi
---
I agree with u bro!! But I one addition to make and a question. Why do u want No to be nerfed?! And u shld also buff crow.

Have you tried doing that?

‚ÄúNo Brawl Talk for the next couple weeks.‚Äù
---
Correct me if I‚Äôm mistaken, but the Brawl Talks usually occur 1-3 days prior to an update, no? If that‚Äôs the case, and the Talk won‚Äôt be coming for *several days* at a time, just how big could this update hypothetically be in terms of the content to be added? Or, am I getting my hopes up too much and this is actually an April Fools‚Äô joke?
---
I personally don‚Äôt like this idea. Supercell should directly face the problem that brawl stars rewards playing like a complete chicken. Gem grab is so stupid because they get all gems and then just chill in the back, making the chance to win next to nothing. 
---
dinamites the guy who throws bombs right?

Eh, I guess you could argue that Hot Point is a more frustrating version of Eye of the Storm. Both have several choke points that are obscured by bushes (E.g., too and bottom around mid, bottom left and upper right corners of the map, etc.), but what makes Hot Point more frustrating IMO is that that map has excessive amounts of (mostly) narrow choke points, whereas Eye of the Storm has fewer choke points which are also larger. Fewer choke points with bushes makes it easier to prevent yourself from getting ambushed by a camper that wants your ass on a platter.
---
I mean, if we‚Äôre talking about *critical* points on the map, points which you‚Äôre likely to pass by, that could be abused by campers, Hot Point has a crapload of those. Between the mid, the six walled corridors w./ bushes around mid, the two corridors surrounded by water at the top, and the three surrounded by water *and* walls at the bottom, there are several opportunities for sandwiching, pinching, etc.
---
I don‚Äôt think Eye of the Storm has this sort of problem because, apart from the two bushes near mid and the two bushy corridors in the bottom left and top right of the map, the size of the bushes on the outer sections of the map are too large to be effectively patrolled/camped in by a single brawler without chancing an *unwanted* interaction with someone else, meaning that campers need to be that little bit more cautious.

Probably never he‚Äôs been gone for like 2 years to get some bacon

Happened to me today. So frustrating 
---
Yes give us this

No, my FR was to mock you. How do you have a maxed brawler so soon. I'm 7500 with 4 500 brawlers but I still don't have even a power 8. You just might be lucky I guess

I meant the bonus in the corner? -_-

Lol players about that are in like the 5% of the pool which isn't much. It was like that with clash of clans and clash Royale and it'll stay like that in brawl stars. After a certain point there just isn't that many players in the same pool so you can't expect the same wait times. And according to them it's active players.

Trophy count doesn't determine if the brawler needs a buff or a nerf, but I would agree with you. People in this subreddit thinks crow needs a buff but I think he's just fine. 
---
The low hitpoints compensate for the speed, small hitbox, and annoying poison of crow.
---
Then after he gets a big buff many people will complain that he's too strong.

I know right. Totally fair. There was a 2 month gap of me getting a new brawler. My luck is so bad I had to buy primo because I was so desperate (I had 2 super rares and rares at that time)
---
If only I have Spike
---
Nice I can‚Äôt wait to get spike. 
---
Yes hahahahha so embarrassing 
---
For real?
---
I thought they changed how matchmaking works... the total trophies, but there's no way you will be matched up with a 12 trophy Shelly. Cuz ITS STILL THE BEGINNING. It might be bots... 
---
Tysm man!
---
Or Lucky to get good team comps.
---
Every fucking time you get cornered by teamers meteors start showering on you like wtf 
---
Boy if you don't-
---
The main problem is that Crow doesn‚Äôt need a buff, his counters needs a nerf. 
---
Some of his biggest counters are currently the best brawlers in the game right now. Pam, Nita, Darryl and even brawlers that aren‚Äôt meta like Bo and Gene. It‚Äôs just people want a buff without actually thinking about why a brawler isn‚Äôt good in the current meta.
---
It‚Äôs also why Showdown is his best mode currently. Showdown has the most diversity when it comes to brawlers, so Crow is able to be decent in most cases.
---
How can he jump
---
&gt;Taiwanese
---
As far as I know it's originated from southern Hokkien. The basic grammar remains, but Taiwanese adopts more foreign terms than Southern Hokkien because Taiwan had been colonized by Japan for about 50 years.

The 1/80whatever chance doesn't mean you are guaranteed to get it from that amount of boxes, it could take hundrets of boxes if you are unlucky

I set the higher trophy range as standard, because everybody eventually ages out of the "youth" trophy range!

Umm u can actually calculate using probability, and above 85 u get 100+% chance.
---
I am honestly more of the opinion Pam should be nerfed than crow should be buffed, she is ridiculous on every mode and every map, is tankier than most and deals more damage than dps characters while being a 'support type character'. Have I mentioned the range on her minigun?
---
Wow very good map

Then why did you keep playing with the Darryl?!
---
It probably wasn't me. We stuck to brawlball. Did play around that number of games though. 
---
that was one daryl. You can check my other posts to find out other ways I managed to titl this hard in 30 minutes. 
---
Only has 2 upvotes tho :') lol
---
I dont get it... can you explain more clearly?
---
200 trophies depending on how many trophies you have on a brawler is about 40 games lol. I am pretty sure you need to get better at bounty instead of raging on reddit. 1 tip I can give you is that playing defensive is better than playing aggressively.
---
Hope it gets more bud
---
On second picture is Bot 2
---
Depends on map
---
I hate this offer. Why do they force us to buy the skin with it? If we have an option to just buy the bmBrawler for less Gems would would've buy it.
---
Oh wow you even deleted the same exact stolen post of this skin...smh
---
early
---
Very cool. Someone should make a list of all brawlers and what they represent in the pic.

I made a fanart for Sakura Spike , please check it out if you have time - [https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/b6wvxu/right\_now\_this\_subreddit\_is\_inclined\_towards/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/b6wvxu/right_now_this_subreddit_is_inclined_towards/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)

Only if I had him...

OK I'm just gonna leave this post here then after a while I'm just gonna delete it

Yes I admit I suck at the game ok

I totally agree. Yesterday I would probably had broken my tablet if the characters of the game had started to comment my lousy gaming after every lost game (there were many)...

I got stroke spike like a month ago

You will get the 1 gem in 5 days. Me on the otherhand, just bought the skin recently for 80...

Instituting player surveys more often than the rate at which they‚Äôre doing so would be a good idea. Maybe one survey every 4-6 weeks could help them gather player data more frequently and efficiently.

Can you give me some tips on how to draw stuff like this, the gene sketch was amazing!

Spike is the best legendary

Go to your phones app store. Press on brawl stars. Then scroll down until you see there email. Then you can send an email to the devs. I hope you get it fixed.

Second account?

I got spike at 400 Tropies
---
To the actual padrons of gold farm, the 4000 gold at lvl 100 is really a great deal
---
Only like 4600, I‚Äôve been too busy with school and life to play recently. 
---
You're just jealous you don't have Sakura spike. Guess who does tho.....
---
Thanks.
---
Main account now, lost access to main
---
Darryl is a high skill cap brawler on that map, try using brock/dyna/barley/penny.
---
REEEEEEEEEE
---
In a short run the 5 dollar offer is better but in a long run 10 dollar is better. Gold is important but after you‚Äôll start maxing your account it becomes useless. Personally I would take the 10 dollar one.
---
#Oh Thanks,  I Also Wanted This.. 
---
and you got a token doubler jeez
---
for some reason using random brawlers is actually good for me. Just won a Brawl ball game with nita lmao
---
Dyna is 60
---
Reminds me of Minecraft Hunger Games
---
That‚Äôs awesome
---
This is actually a good offer. I saw an earlier offer for Leon and it cost the same 549 gems, but this one is also giving you a free skin.
---
this does not mean I side with r/mortisgang. I am still in the Shelly gang
---
With that many tickets, I'm sure you can get at least one gem this weekend.
---
too empty

I got him yesterday!

You forgot thicc

True that, i should have noticed. But i never got a brawler out of a big box. Does it give items first and then the brawler. In that case it is possible.
---
Sorry

Gg Landi well deserved.
---
Also can you send me your friend request?
---
very, highest was 504, now he is here. Sitting in the 300s. Im just gonna wait till I get the star power tbh
---
Oh my god, you got token doublers, how lucky!

Yep. That‚Äôs what everyone has. It was a joke

This has got to be the cutest thing i have ever seen

Depends what you need. If you‚Äôre not maxed out and still need to upgrade brawlers, for sure the refresher pack. If you are pretty much maxed out and coins don‚Äôt have much value, go with the other pack
---
what a great idea! one of the cutest things i have seen in my life!!
---
not true... leon is still op

Probably my favourite so far, great job man! Really hope Supercell takes some of your concepts.

Also the quality is improving imo üòå

Wizard Barley: I am about to end this man‚Äôs whole career

No. Complete waste of $5 for the low quantity.

NO SPIKE IT'S A TRAP
---
thanks :D
---
Buff crow
---
No itis not because if I had two more Brawlers that were not max level I would have received almost three times as many points
---
Doubt it‚Äôll happen. The value of gems in each game varies. In clash of clans you can get them super easy but they don‚Äôt have as much value as clash royale or brawl stars have. It just wouldn‚Äôt work
---
Right

You got 4 and a half days to get a gem, you‚Äôll be fine
---
wizard barley is so nice skin i think :)
---
That‚Äôs what he said 
---
It was a mere whisper, which grew to legend.  They say the last person to unlock a brawler from a box died before his story could be told. 
---
Well, there's Leon...
---
I don‚Äôt get this post what so ever
---
thank you :) i hope so

What makes you think a person "deserves" legendaries?

Nope :p

Iron man, aren't u?

You are so lucky I‚Äôm level 64 and no legendaries and one mythic

For sure you should get it. You‚Äôd save over 40 gems, which is half of its original cost
---
r/itswooooshnotwhoooosh
---
Man he should shoot different colors of ice creams.
---
That's how it looks on the angel dude, it's even. Just in thw preview map it's a little behind because you need to see the spawn points can't have boxes covering them, I thought the same thing on some maps
---
Alternative: make it like 500/1000 tokens and the clubtoken thing fills when members collect their individual tokens. When it reaches 500/1000 tokens, everyone gets a big/mega box

I already see this map ü§î

It is the best skin supercell have made ,maybe they really wanted people to sign up for supercell ID
---
Now you're getting it
---
Can you explain?
---
Thx for making this site. I love it!
---
You are so unlucky compared to me I have a spike at level 15
---
So good
---
I only got the skin offer. 49 gems for it, guess who now has a skin for spike
---
In my complete honest opinion, any legendary gotten under 5k is undeserved, and a double legendary gotten under 10k is undeserved
---
This is just my view as someone at 8.8k trophies missing the legendaries, Pam, Tara, and Carl
---
 I think it would be nice if he could shoot vanilla, chocolate, mint, strawberry and many other ice creams. 
---
Are you planning to add skins to some brawlers (leon and tara for example)?
---
Mythics have a lower chance of unlocking them so its a great luck
---
The hands are very creepy but other than that it's pretty nice
---
Everytime new flavours!
---
Gotta love them guys who restart accounts to do these stupid grinds to flex on people .
---
#Weird flex but okay! 
---
It takes time to make skins, they can‚Äôt just look at it and automatically add them. Also, some of the brawlers Gedi-kor makes designs for don‚Äôt have a remodel yet so pointless for supercell to make them. Lastly, supercell releases skins with updates and at the moment, theres no news for an update. So sit down and chill out
---
Yeah they forgot to credit me for it ;)
---
If Penny and Jessie are 16, Nita at least 14, Piper must be at least 21, Tara at least 25, Pam at least 40, 
---
Good game
---
This is my main account, I thought it would be fun..
---
You are so talented!
---
Oh ok keep up the good work :)
---
leon powerpoints*

I've heard that either the square or cube root of the probability of a certain rarity is added to the legendary odds when you unlock all brawlers of that rarity.
---
alas, earwax.

He already used up his luck for the next 1000000 years.
---
that's nice
---
Are you sure he exists? I've never seen him
---
Glad you like it! And I like that you took advantage of the ability to move the IKE turrets around :) I dunno if they ever implement a map like this, but I‚Äôve been playing with the idea as well! I think it could work out nicely if the bolt spawns adjust to it.
---
He means like all his luck is gone rn by having this much luck
---
So 2 ppl that play 24/7 could steal all the glory?
---
It is a spike with name crow
---
Croissant
---
i think you should have made that a little more clear

What about EL PRIMOOOOOO as Rey Mysterio? And Leon as John Cena?

Nice!

yeah lemme just take my 3000 coc gems to brawl stars

What does this mean ???????????

Thats an interseting theory, especially the Alfred Nobel reference. 
---
&gt;2. He sounds like that one person to talk like: Herba derba derba herba, which is a way to mock the swedish/Scandinavian language.
---
I don't think Supercell would add something that mocks someone, but maybe they would, as Finland and Sweden are kinda enemies (especially in hockey). He doesn't sound swedish though.
---
Great work as always!
---
Noice. My Carl's is still around 200 trophies everytime I start to do well with him I find myself starting to lose cuz I'm being to aggressive... I think...

My fav at the moment may be crow....

I think we csn also use it as skin for primo
---
Teach me the ways.
---
Solo showdown until I start to lose haha
---
Why are you so good?
---
False. Legendary drop rate drops a lot after getting a legendary, so the chance of getting the second one if much lower.
---
\[idiot just be like\] I don't see anything Nita-related
---
Haha, are you in a band? Try find some teammates and you can gain trophies really fast!
---
It doesn't matter if you're mostly lurking in bushes.  Change my Mind. 
---
How?
---
Yes, It's loading your player info
---
Bowpe its shelly. If evryone jumps to it you can basecly spamm your special until evryone dies
---
LOOKS SICK! Would love to see more!
---
&gt;I see that we have a 1% chance per draw of pulling a star power. And that each brawl box gives you three draws. Isn't that a 3% chance per brawl box?
---
I don't know about this but I guess thats how it works... If someone knows please let me know
---
&gt;And If I haven't misunderstood anything, you should have a really good chance of getting one after 40-50 brawl boxes or so, like 70% or 80%, isn't that right?
---
It will always be 1% no matter what
---
yeep
---
I did the same thing with crow and leon last summer. I‚Äôm working on lvl 1 carl leon and gene right now.

Dealer? Does she have good prices?

*Dynamike enters the chat*
---
i have spike so the offer had only the skin !!!
---
but if you dont have spike then you well get spike and sakora spike offer
---
no, not all people have lots of options, this will limit them to much.
---
Œô like wukong so I‚Äôd like to see something similar since the game already is similar with lol champs 
---
Just remember before you buy in-game currencies, think about what one (insert in-game currency here) is equal to in real money. 
---
15 gems is equal to $1 USD.
---
Sorry for that. I have design works and 3d study and english study and exercise. Busy these day. But i will try one for 2 ~ 3 days :)

Both

also tara is there for damage control

not for F2P players

That's literally the best one you've ever made! üòÅ

Thanks the only reason I stopped doing this was because I didn't get any up votes.  I had even started drawing the ideas as comics but I guess people don't like stories. I'll still post the next one I guess if u want.

oh i see.. good luck and work hard for 3d study and english! much love! &lt;3

You must engage in the creation of 3D models! We want you in the supercell team so maybe one day one of these skins will become reality!

This has to be my favorite one yet! Absolutely amazing!

---
How do you make the skins?
---
That means so  many things
---
I love ice cream so I would definitely buy this skin
---
Yea kinda worth it i think, however if you're patient enough you might wanna wait for a legendary only offer, to get it for cheaper. Then again Sakura Spike really is a sick skin, and being left with 200 gems is still really good. So i'd say go for it
---
Good job Gedi! Looks really nice
---
Ikr so I fixed it
---
I think he should throw mint chocolate chips (like you have) and little chocolate spikes come out although I don‚Äôt know about the super, comment your suggestions pls
---
In the middle and in the U shaped bushes.
---
HMm, first crow pack with skin. Now Spike. next leon? 
---
See I just saw ‚ÄúUs‚Äù so I was thinking SuperCell was referencing Jeremiah 11:11.

I‚Äôm still shook from that movie but that‚Äôs all I got. üíÄ

I‚Äôd rather have leon in shop :(
---
then how about you mention this (respectfully) from the beginning next time, saying you aren't a fan of this, and don't downvote because you realize it isn't made in mean spirit, don't comment, scroll down, and move on with your life. 
---
besides, don't the needs (in this case amusement) of the many outweigh the needs of the few? its literally tagged with [Humor] so just learn to take a joke man. it wasn't targeted to you specifically anyway.

 I have a friend who unlock 4 brawler in 4 box ( one in 3,2 billon

Chill out dude... Its cool that you wanted it to go out fast...

Wouldn't it be Power cubes and not gems?

What did it cost?

I wish, I will be busy

We will be holding open tournaments every other week and we hold Omen member prize tournaments also every other week

Why does every post like this have Leon as the selected brawler?

I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs how it works, but it‚Äôs just speculation. Lemme get a copy paste:
---
I assume it‚Äôs a linear model, where if a category makes up x% of the sum of all the chances of the legal categories (which may not be the listed percentage) that category gains x% of the ‚Äòextra percentage‚Äô from the cleared out categories. I actually made a post about it (here)[https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/8zawxv/written_vs_actual_drop_chances/].

I think it‚Äôs the other third skin...it‚Äôs going to be a Spike with red robes and instead of throwing a cactus üåµ Tether Spike will throw SCISSORS‚úÇÔ∏è 
---
Feel free to quote me on 1% chance this happens.
---
Btw i dont know if there are more songs been than those 4
---
Whoever made this is an auteur.
---
LOVE IT
---
it just means "do what you feel like"
---
r/aww

Julius Caesar is getting pretty unsettled by the sharpness of that blade

r/subsididntknowexisted
---
Why was he spinning it was just you two left lol
---
And Its been a struggle with my lvl. 5 to reach 300... Im real bad at shelly 
---
I don't remember, but I can send you the template
---
add new epic character named Lex if you saw it thanks
---
Thx for explanation
---
Good job on stealing this from dumpert and not giving credit to the creator 
---
#üÖ±Ô∏è
---
Same here man, i spent 80 gems and now it's 39
---
You lucky bastard! Happy for u tho
---
I love it!
---
That‚Äôs brutal. My cousin got spike at 0.1104 then Leon the day after that with whatever chance he had. 
---
And only 39 gems now:) ok its worth it
---
I had this idea because there are few movies that bring together several characters on the cover, already in the game is much more common.
---
Try winning some games. I heard that helps :)
---
Oh my god!I love your skins!Can you draw new skins for Carl please!?
---
I read the comments and the man played with randoms on brawl ball!!! MASSIVE RESPECT BRO
---
And its also a living example that randoms arent the worat thing in the world... 
---
There should be a tall cactus spike, like this üåµ. I think that would be funny 
---
Thats so confusing sorry. I don‚Äôt understand any of that
---
i find it kinda of funny, i find it kinda sad
---
Nevermind , I reposted the Art with a different method I hope it's visible now , thanks for letting me know tho. :D
---
i agree with you, i didn't even like to play barley until i saw that i had his wizard skin, i didn't even knew it was same champion until them 
---
now i play it a lot :p
---
Where are the knights?
---
W H A T     T H E    ? ? ?  ! ! !
---
I can see this as a primo skin. Primos and Mega Nights Attack set are literally the same
---
He‚Äôs only complaining because he got 7th. If he got first it would have been like: WAM BAM HERE COMES PAM
---
I thought Sakura spike was Kanna Kobayashi.
---
Mine was Carl , although I got Spike at 3.7 K trophies , right now , I am at 5.4K
---
Idk who made it, someone sent it to me :/
---
Theres supposed to be an L in there right?
---
Hehe , she is :D This is the scene where she fights with Tohru.
---
You realize that the drink wears off right. Dumbass. It‚Äôs kinda pointless without the drink. 
---
I think I heared this player screaming 
---
Try contacting support if you can refund the difference because you literally bought it yesterday 
---
Brawl Stats isn't run by Supercell...
---
that Shelly definitely killed you
---
Pls do more, its great
---
I asked because I did a post with this meme for like two days ago that got like 700 upvotes so I think you got it from me. :)
---
Okay. Guess you are the champ. Good for you my guy.
---
I got my first epic at 3100 and I‚Äôm currently at 3250 with 16/24. Even then, I still think I‚Äôm on the luckier side of brawl stars, I‚Äôve seen plenty of 5k+ who haven‚Äôt completed their collection of super rated and have yet to get an epic, mythic, or legendary.
---
Yay maybe 
---
More like 'when you buy the legendaries in the shop'
---
This is a mobile game.
---
Well I know it is outdated but still.
---
Just think of it as when he was first released 
---
Beat me to it
---
Play with friends.
---
Actually, 4750.
---
Yes
---
He‚Äôs the toughest of them all
---
Leon is not even op jeez more brawlers are more op what about trowers and massive dmf they do? 
---
I like that! Does it move enemy? 
---
I don't get it too 
---
generic 10 year old who has low self esteem and feels the need to shit post and have a little "cute crow avatar" next to your name bud
---
I‚Äôm sorry. I don‚Äôt really know what to say. 
---
If you have any suggestions I‚Äôd be happy to edit this for you. üòÉ 
---
Thanks for your art post! If you are not the creator of this work, please make sure that you have included the source, or to  comment it here! Unsourced art may be removed if you are not the creator.
---
Is Leon bisexual??!
---
/s
---
r/woosh
---
You can get power points and a new brawler in a normal box.
---
STOP DOING MAZES WITH 1 TILE GAPS! 
---
Lololol. Reddit is extra salty when u do something difficult. How can u possibly have done something that I cant do? I am the greatest brawler in history....  lololol. These people. Nice job man. Truly impressive 
---
The fact that Leon got credit for the kill made it 10x better.
---
Don't worry, I did :) 
---
Thats not true because I dont go down on people.  
---
Awesome
---
What app is this?
---
In a few years Jessie will take over that store.
---
At the end it doesn‚Äôt really matter if you spin? Kinda a friendly gesture like ‚Äúgg‚Äù. Who are you gonna team with? The cactus?
---
Ur name is E P I C
---
Ooh a nice change from the top and bottom. I like it
---
Ok
---
Wowowowowow
---
Nerf crow
---
woah
---
I swear to God If somebody played here there I am gonna call my mom 
---
Username checks out...
---
heck no
---
Can someone explain pls 
---
Yeah white crow is the best /s
---
Nice piece of WORK.
---
I would disagree, I think if you have a button that pops up a menu to select a message wouldn't be take up to much room. Don't have to be paragraphs but a simple message to get team on same page. Also you can have your thumbs anywhere on screen so you wouldn't have to worry about tapping in on mistake. And I don't wanna play a game I have to download another app( discord) and try to find people that can play the game... 
---
Please
---
Will it come out on android/iOS
---
O
---
The thing is i dont get any power points which is really frustrating. I get points for Leon/nita/shelly which are already power level 6-7 but Mortis? Nope. 
---
I'ts annoying yes, but the whole point of Showdown is to try and be the last one standing. Even if only one person isn't trying to kill you the whole match, you will still get chased by other people so... what's the difference?
---
to bad I don't have brawlstars üò≠
---
Can you count?
---
They had us in the first half 
---
I need that now 
---
Yum
---
not even at the shop? 
---
Right, theyre never ment to be of similar value
---
not gonna lie
---
i got 6 powerpoints for mortis for free once.
---
üò≠
---
Other than star power, this is EL PRIMO 
---
^(is here)
---
What‚Äôs hell got to do with any of this? And send this video to help and support and see what they say. 
---
I sent them a video with proof that members from Tribe gaming were win trading... 
---
Their response summarized was ‚ÄúThese players will never rise high in trophies‚Äù.. not even a ban or warning to them. Just that 
---
And best voice 
---
r/whoooosh
---
* laughs in El Primo *
---
So he tried to go away then he died lmao
---
You guys are just a bunch of sheep honestly you see a few people say he needs a buff and just follow along without knowing anything ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I would tell you not to but you might like it
---
u sir are a hero #stopthespin
---
Ha, that‚Äôs cute
---
I agree with you, I think this guys dont know how to use him or he is low trophies.
---
Ya
---
We have a looking for team channel in our Discord 
---
Using Piper in BrawlBall*
---
Maybe a little 
---
i was rank 15
---
Bro the people complaining that he needs a buff probably play super aggressive with him and expect not to die.. he doesn‚Äôt need a buff you guys just suck with him 
---
i posted not this graphic but the idea yesterday i agree that the first thing i thought when i saw this in the store and remember when they said the next update would be green Leon skin confirmed
---
Cory said shes the lowest skill cap
---
That too
---
The game need this
---
True lo l
---
His sheer ability to cop the bolts might be enough to make him worth it
---
Nah thats worse 
---
Unsing piper in fest or famine tho....
---
It is.
---
üòÇprobably, I only play brawl ball for the box. 
---
My ego ü§î I don't care about that. And if anything yours is taking a huge hit, you're the dickwad sitting here tryna act tuff online with these emojis SmH. Why don't you just find some other person to embarrass yourself too. You're cringing me out... 
---
I understood that reference.
---
Also, incoming calls making me almost deaf. 
---
P
---
Should be like a 1000 or 10000 because I usually get 100 wins in a week easy and I‚Äôm about an average player
