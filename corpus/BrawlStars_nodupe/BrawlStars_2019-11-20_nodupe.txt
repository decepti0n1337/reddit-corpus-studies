What‚Äôs with the SF | then a name? I‚Äôve come across four other players with that username, not including this one.

---
Same but i got mortis instead
---
Finally someone noticed. Thank you
---
Same, I just instantly know that it's one if those when they are not maxed and immediately run to the middle, spam their shots and die. I usually see them around 600-700 though
---
I literally found 3 10 trophy opponents when I was grinding my Primo(Rank 13) on my alt account. Everyone on my team had about 220 like me
---
Ok this is a long story, but basically i have an box oppening addiction formed from the sole desperate desire to unlock crow, i've developed that due to excessive shelly abuse i've suffered trough most of my time playing this game, and now all i wish is to unlock the character with the most annoying playstyle so i can just infernize every single one who want those free kills that shelly gets every showdown
---

---
Basically, i want to use the annoying to annoy the annoying

We get this post every single month üòÖ It has nothing to do with Brawl Talk. There are many hundreds of unlisted videos used for ads in local languages. Keep in mind, the next update will be very very small.

Is this brawler good? Just got him out of a brawl box like 30 mins ago and he feels so weak üòû

Allow me to introduce myself.
---
Kind of disappointing there was nothing today but I'm happy we at least got free shit for womens day
---
oh ok but i doubt that autocorrect would correct angle to engle
---
El primo doesnt suck in bossfight, hes not as good as bull overall but hes still a good pick, high dps high hp a fast reload and a good escape super make him excellent in sticky situations.
---
Yup :)
---
I did not know this for big box... Thanks for telling us now I know when I will get a new brawler..

Sorry about sideways video. No idea how to fix.

Stop posting this on the subreddit. At this point, it‚Äôs a cesspool of karma farming and ‚Äúplease stop‚Äù posts.
---
Does the big box apply for star powers as well?
---
As someone who has had all brawlers lvl 10 for quite some time, I can tell you with absolute certainty that Mega boxes do not give the same amount as 10 Small boxes. This was based on my opening of ~35 Mega boxes and 800 Small boxes looking for star powers.
---
I'm guessing that Mega boxes do not calculate the conversion of points into coins correctly.
---
Small boxes I have gotten a few with 170 coins (70 coins + 50 points(25x2x2=100 coins)). Normally they range from ~40(very rare) to ~90(most common).
---
The MOST I have ever gotten from a Mega box, was 564 coins. That is the MOST out of 35 Mega boxes and that number is including the 10 sets of points(all brawlers maxed).
---
The additional rewards of gems/token doublers seem the same but it seems very clear to me that Mega boxes do not offer the same amount of rewards(as stated in its description).
---
If no one has cataloged box opens until now, I will begin doing so just to prove this point.
---
Also our archer, bird, miner, and cactus

Why is primo a girl tho....?

You forgot the part where it‚Äôs supposed to be funny

No, MOST characters have the same speed

That defeats the purpose of a season tho... it gives you a deadline which I sentivises you to play more and give them more money. It wouldn‚Äôt make sense for them to do that

I'd rather not. His followers will turn this sub into a racist sub with all the cringe indians-poo-in-street content.

Its in the actual game files

I only know that Leon and Mortis are faster than the rest, and 8-bit Is slower

Are the exceptions are Leon and 8-bit?

And Mortis (maybe Crow)

pls make more

And nita : AYAYAYAYA

Your soul is mine

Nevermind I found a full list. Turns out there are like 5 brawlers with slightly better speed and 3 with fast speed. (8-bit is REALLY slow apparently.)

That‚Äôs just cringe

i think it's the hardest to find out if i got a brawler from a normal box. thanks for the wisdom
---
Oof I have all of them in 12k and I‚Äôm a f2p
---
That's a freaking lot, are you obsessed, I barely play these days and I sit at 13k trophies
---
I have used a 3D art program before, but I don‚Äôt have the program and I not that great at modeling.
---
I'd gladly take a starpower over any legendary , , the legendaries are so unbalanced and out of meta rn.... Sandy was overpowered now , shes' underpowered , leon is viable only in showdown /lonestar etc , crow is good but very few people know how to use him correctly same with spike .
---
The other day i opened a big box-27 coins and 63 power points  for piper and i had 1 item remaining- sandy. I still have to unlock tara and mortis and star powers and sandy was my last needed legendary lol
---
Thats the whole point i guess you didnt read my account r/okbrawlerretard

Lucky bastard
---
Same i got sandy the other day from a big box with 27 coins and it was my last leggy at 15k and i still need mortis and tara and some star powers xd

Every brawler but emz at 6k. Why does it take everyone so long or am I just lucky?

?

he is speaking the language of gods

I made it to 14k without legends...
---
Congrats!
---
Well, if youre fighting for equal rights then you should "forget" the past to some extent and respect your case, in a way it seems hypocritical that this time "you dont get equal rights here because of the mistakes people of your gender made" but hey, its not like feminists wouldnt want something like this (if they play bs lmao), this was sc's decision
---
r/justbecausesomeoneusedwoooshdoesntmeanyouhavetoreplyinsubreddit
---
Dude this is like me but its my second account that i got spike from a regular box and the account was at about 1000 trophies while my main account doesnt have a single legendary but all the other brawlers at 10000 trophies.
---
How do YOU know it‚Äôs not a mongoose huh!?
---
You're right
---
Shut up you hoe
---
Tbh I think its actually quite insulting to only do something like this on women's day, its like suggesting women *need* this advantage to be equal to men (if ofc you dont also give men X thing)

Two years after playing? The game has only been released for me since January 2019.
---
Luckily for me I got Leon within a month of playing.

So far I have every brawler, almost all maxed too, and have spent a maximum of ¬£30 on the game entirely, and that‚Äôs only due to the one in a million deals that occasionally show up.

 Currently on 15.1K trophies üëå

I dont understand why people still use shelly, el primo in insane 5 and up?? please can someone explain...I swear i have never seen a shelly survive till enraged mode.

When?

You can see determine brawlers gender just by the look of them in the game, you don't need the files lol

Yo, Leon got one of us

Why does anybody accept '1k idiots' as his in-game friends, if he really doesn't want to play with them? No offence.

Why do you call him an idiot. He just wants to play and possibly learn from you.
---
I would love to stay but people don't even accept each other to play matches together or at least respond to team up together in Power Play and that's not cool. The reason why I joined a club is to find teammates to play in Power Play, and unfortunately I still find myself playing with randoms all the time just because people don't accept each other into their team. I do not wish to name people but 10 year old kids like ParadoxDonut are just utterly rude towards one another, calling people "noob" when they haven't even played with that person.
---
I left because I want to find a club that can actually help each other out and not just quickly reject everyone who wants to join their team or insult people rudely.

Ok let me tell what I know this may or may not be true 2but look this is what I know

So first reason to get banned is that three or more people in your club may have reported you on an abuse for example (the best brawler in cavern chern and shit) or just that three or more players intentionally  reported you on purpose a d last but not least this what  I think and I have said that this may or may not be true and you should probably stop playing the game for atleast 14 days cuz That is the cooldown for your ban or its just permanent
---
wow!
---
Oh, I see. Then it is probably time to consider changing club to one that doesn't accept low trophy players as members..?

So it is COW?!

We don't treat them better. We recognize they are a disenfranchised demographic and try to bring awareness to that fact. Bitching about not getting your gems just because women get some is like bitching about already being in first place.

I get your point but this is not the right way to improve how to get star points. Not including high level play, It‚Äôs even worse in random matchmaking where you play with randoms who only want to get star key. This will only encourage ‚Äúno teamwork‚Äù. 
---
There is still an objective to win
---
-true, it‚Äôs still there but you are now adding other agendas like trying to go for star key. 
---
That is true that if there‚Äôs such a huge difference in skill then you will win(anyway) but that‚Äôs besides the point.

I would consider it to be the same as Ulting anyone else normally. It's easy to dodge Gene already, so it doesn't feel like there are any neccessary adjustments to grab a teammate. If this ability were to become viewed as overpowered then I would suggest yes, slightly narrowing the window for an Ally pull because it is more gamechanging to pull your teammate out of 3 enemies than it is to pull 1 enemy of 3 off your teammate.

amazing fanart 9/10

could use a little more details

Won't criticise, it's everybody's opinion, though I don't team just ignore a weak player who took wrong brawler in match by mistake and go for a better opponent. My friend who r on low level do spin cuz they don't understand how it feels to be in 2v1.
---
Yes i can really see that ypu captured the essence of spike and put hard work into this masterpiece

I come from the future... it's not bright

Wow such amazing wow

And Gene will be the one who do the dumb shit

You should take a look at Brocks ear whos had his ear stuck in his rocket launcher for ages
---
I know... I am at 15,000 tropies - but Bibi's star powers are *really* good + even if you are doing trick shot 1950 for trick shot - thing that really rare - its very bad...
---
Same

Gene needs to get fixed. His Supers just seem too misplaced. I get he's meant to be a support character, but it's like his abilities are aimless in that regard. His heal farts are *okay*. But his beefy attack super means you're much less willing to use his grab, which is a core mechanic to his play style. it's like making Jesse want to never drop a turret because her attacks can now bounce 50% faster.
---
Yep. There is also one showdown game where El primo was so buffed and was in the middle of the map, and it was me (as tick) vs someone else, we fighting for the 2nd place around him (almost no space left) and he was letting us decide it by ourselves, knowing he would be first anyway
---
Ok so ever since this was posted I have worshipped this image ever since
---
Is not
---
what
---
Posso te dar uma ideia?

At least a drop for the 2 invisiheal buffs

So it just electrify the wooden box for 3 seconds.

Opa, claro!

I posted a Thumbnail earlier but I think the post was burries a it didn't really show the character. :o

Yes but dumb teammates can already hurt anyways

Why are u mad?

Ok nvm that's not a naruto headband

I agree tbh, overall with the last part

I just sent the invite mate, my name in game is ‚ú®Diogo‚ú®

We could try supercell make when Ricochet is in the spotlight...

Aver... Necesitas poner esto en ingl√©s porque supercell va a las etiquetas que pone "ideas" y normalmente salen las m√°s populares, si quieres que Supercell vea esto necesitas ponerlo en ingl√©s y que la gente le de likes para que salga muy arriba del apartado "ideas".

invisiheal needs a nerf, i tried lone star with poco (my only brawler with star power) and i was about to kill a leon but he used invisiheal. Poco has low attack so i cant kill him

Hello! Could I please use your clip in my Brawl Stars Highlights series? :) You would be properly credited in the video and in the description of the video.

---
Well yeah, after playing a game for two freaking years you'd think I'd have it max
---
When it doesn't clear the previous images
---
Great, I am Hungarian :) Suprecell should expand it, end game is crap, I think :S
---
I love want rocket no.4 or ambush. Still haven't gotten them. Neither does snappy and incendiary
---
Issue is now Leon is played like a tank because his super is useless for how it‚Äôs supposed to be used (assassin), so a star power that doesn‚Äôt fit him at all is his best one
---
Society isn't ready for that level of commitment yet
---
What if it won't cancel the super? Then you could pull Frank over to hit them unexpectedly
---
"¬°Soy el mejor!"
---
I just absolutely love it when my teammates grab gems on their way to kill the gem carrier, especially when they just die and give them the ones they brought.
---
Really makes me happy when they repeatedly do that and hand over 10 gems that we could have made a come back with.
---
I like crow
---
He‚Äôs basically crow but also useful in lone star, and worse in solo showdown
---
Also, according to his backstory he was hit by a meteor and didn't die.
---
Heist but a brawler instead of a safe?
---
Ryan, take or leave it
---
still
---
They did a great job with Sandy though. Voice and lines are spot on for a young sleepy sandman.
---
Maybe... but, if they expand it the people will play more
---
(:0)-/-&lt;
---
so original and funny...
---
It's not night mode, Supercell just has a sets of different shadow patterns (maybe they're supposed to be clouds?) so the gameplay feels more "natural". you might've gotten lucky and got a large shadow pattern. :P
---
yeah but the sthing can still apply to a lot of other characters so
---
r/simpleanti@brawlstarsbrawl
---
Nice ass, :D

I think gem grab is the most competitive.

Take my upvote. I love this.

treat this as you want, but I will be sincerely grateful to you if you help me promote the post &lt;3

Is it real?
