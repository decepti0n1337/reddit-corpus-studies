They deserved that. Spinning NEAR their goal.

Bull: imma turn Mortis into Mort*was* lmao
---

---
Mortis: not today bih
---
I am a bad Spike player
---
y e s
---
Waah that sucks !
---
True, those noobs who said Mortis needs a damage buff just want Mortis to be able to 3 shot Bull... Mortis doesn‚Äôt need a damage, range or reload speed buff he just needed to be used better... you can check bushes if you have brain cells
---
to darryl a surf board) i love this it would nice with summer jesse
---
Nice artwork!
---
But is the lollipop safe to eat???
---
Now his looks can match his voice
---
Stretched
---
Well just want to tell you. Ninja is a famous twitch fortnite streamer. Hes known for being good at it.
---
Unless there is a wall that‚Äôs when you can check the bushes but if there isn‚Äôt you can‚Äôt really.
---
That's super impressive
---
If you noob why not
---
‚ÄúHear me, my caretaker who is a woman, for I require your assistance‚Äù
---
Seriously, if there is a wall, many other brawlers cany check the bush too XD Players who said buff Mortis are either in Mortis Gang or they basically suck
---
why lol?
---
Thanks- I did kind of gather that, never paid much attention to Fortnite so I guess that‚Äôs why I‚Äôve never heard of him.

He needs it to stop doing literally what you said man he needs help
---
I‚Äôve been playing for 2 years and I still don‚Äôt have all the brawlers maxed
---
–ß—Ç–æ
---
Most brawlers can outdamage mortis at a close range and I agree that he could use a small buff just not something really significant
---
His younger siblings played
---
He doesn‚Äôt. He was saying he‚Äôd get the 13k level rewards. I was over 13k at one point last season but finished below it and didn‚Äôt get the 13k rewards.
---
Yeah me too.
---
Yeah me too
---
this account has so many things wrong with it i don't even know where to start
---
r/ihadastroke

U forgot auto-aim

I saw this idea before this... Is this a re-draw or art stealüòÖ
---
Yeah man calm down.  Just take a rest,  everyone is bad at something. For example my barley
---
buddy, that's where i stop you, took him to 600 at lvl 7 i don't wanna hear it
---
What filters?
---
i think i remember watching a rage compilation of him where he cusses a ton, threatens to ban the little kids account as well not handling t-bagging
---
A long ranged brawler going up to kill wtf
---
Stop the spin
---
Ikr
---
Don‚Äôt rush to give away your acount - which is not allowed by the way - when from what you just described it seams pretty good. Often when I go on a streak it‚Äôs cos I am playing a brawler on a map that doesn‚Äôt work for him/her just so I can get them up that little bit. Just be patient and play with someone else, untill a better game mode or map comes out
---
ePiC gAmEr MoMeNt
---
That wouldn‚Äôt make sense
---
Shroud is very friendly guy he got stream sniped by so many players and he just starting laughing and ninja got stream sniped insta ban
---
Huh. I just got back from a bounty game as Jessie where one of my teammates had no idea what they were doing.
---
Just praise that,you don't get a colt who kamikazes into the enemy base and kills no one
---
Right
---
Yes, that's true, and same for Plants vs. Zombies, however. PvZ has a special nostalgia making it better than BrawlStars (My opinion, even if you don't agree).
---
I still love pulling up that video of him screaming at that kid xD xD xD
---
Do robots even have pp
---
Same tho
---
This is very underrated. This design is simple but also detailed, I love it.
---
Firstly, Ice Brock in my opinion looks boring. And the skin idea is wasted when he could have used the idea to make a skin for say, Piper. Secondly, Bathtub Carl also looks boring and I feel that it makes no sense at all. I mean, why is this naked guy in a bathtub attacking me? I also don't like some skin ideas and find some to be poorly executed. Clown Mortis is looks as ugly as Night witch mortis, while Chicken Crow doesn't look like a Casual Skin for Crow at all
---
A true creature of the night
---
I do, and he‚Äôs not half bad
---
r/mortisgang
---
You are a person of cultivation since you know Plants vs. Zombies. Only early 2000's kids would know about the legendary PvZ.
---
I think that for the competitieve brawlstats subreddit this subreddit is for all things brawl
---
Wow it's so big !
---
What? All I'm saying is you made me crack a huge grin.
---
Dude, don‚Äôt spin after you kill someone, it‚Äôs kinda disrespectful especially since you didn‚Äôt even win in a hard fought battle
---
/r/woooosh

Nice

Those are some cool shurikens. I also like the jagged purple strip
---
*Ahem* *Pulls Google Search Engine*
---
Google: Did you mean *Virgins?*
---
Downvoted for asking a question smh
---
I tenth this
---
Um no.. Wait actually... Yeah I see this making sense.
---
Brawl Stars does have flaws that should be fixed, but at least for me it is really frustrating to see people complain about every single thing about this game and never actually point out the good things it has, It is almost as if no one on this Sub Reddit has fun with it anymore. I do agree that this game should have more stuff to do besides grinding trophies and max out your brawlers, Supercell is not thinking about maxed out accounts at the moment because there aren't many Maxed players, They will eventually get to it i suppose.
---
Also yes, you can criticize something you love, as well as you can love something so much that you just say "fuck it" and love it even if you know it has minor flaws.
---
Relevant brawler name.
---
I do it for the memes really, never have the intention of direspecting someone after all it is a game so no hard feelings.
---
Well dynamike got star player so ya
---
Bibibi like
---
So, you bought cheap gems ü•¥
---
It was a mega box 12 and then 9....... I also got 3 tickets
---
Poor bull
---
Wait people play Mortis like Bull? Oh no bweno, its like the buff Crow last year.
---
I mean he already designs 3D models for a different mobile game.
---
When you, Brock, who owns a rocket launcher, get obliterated by a small child with a plastic baseball bat that spins for who know what

ClAsH roYalE cOpiEd ClAsH oF cLanS
---
Tara is extremely good no buff needed. Dyna and piper also don‚Äôt need a buff, if you think so you‚Äôre probably just bad at them. And i agree with poco he does need a buff
---
But supercell shelled out big money for this event so Ninja  benefited
---
Once I was a Brock, we were winning our gem grab, but at the last moment I used the jump pads and I landed on the enemy team with all the 12 gems. Thanks for the good randoms, we still won. And yeah that time, I was the stupid random.üòÖüòÖ
---
Put a Piper in enemy team and you guys are screwed
---
Yeah, but will he in the future with the viewers he lost
---
Me and the girls
---
im pretty sure that nobody can anyways
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
unless you are a darryl or pretty much anyone with a mobility super
---
The dynamike's teammates were all afk so yeah. Plus he had remarkable aim.
---
Please give me tara tips i only have her at 100 trophies
---
How do you get the pins?
---
Or you can just call it "Neon Leon"
---
So true
---
lol get rekt
---
Like how Donghoon has Carl
---
Buff Crow ended months ago
---
I twelveth this
---
Im from Chile, i like these time in 1815 when chile fights for liberty, (United States do it like 40 years after lol) the patriotswere preparing to organize an attack to the Spaniards and be free, he use this kind of clothes
---
Love how that tara missed such an easy shot
---
What the heck happened lmao
---
I read somewhere that gems bought "illegally" will be taken back but I don't want to assume that that's what happened
---
Tara is great at brawl ball, for many reasons. She can take out tanks very well if you keep your distance. And can shut down enemy pushes with a single super. If you want to push your tara. Just play brawl ball.
---
just sayin

Yep

go back to twitter no one cares about your opinion, welcome to the real world

No Its A Brand Of Lube But I Think Yes

"Remarkable"
---
Ahhh That must ve #1 Dynamike
---
From what I heard he is getting a remodel and then after that he will get skins just like tara and a few others
---
What map and game mode it doesn‚Äôt seem that bad

Well, wow! That's amazingly bad! Congrats!

Agree

Are we not going to talk about how she is faster than all tanks? She is definitely faster than Shelly, bull, primo, etc. She needs to have the same speed as these brawlers so she doesn‚Äôt just catch up to you when your low on health.

He has way more impressive stats than me, but I have way more Trophies than his max? What the Hell is this?

Lol but seriously buff mortis r/PocoGang are backing up mortis to get more of a higher chance of getting a buff

Random brawlers who intentionally stand there to lose trophies. Such dickheads.

Funny how Carl looks so similar to the Bomber.

We can't really compare the two game and the both are pretty fun...

100% true, so weak that most of the brawler can 1 shot him while he roll in

15/10 can you do legends Next?

Oh,i didnt see them then!

Il' go check them out

I fourteenth this

Exactly. And Teamers team to benefit themselves, whereas Gamethrowers through games just to be assholes.

If you like the skin, go for it, Glad I didn‚Äôt buy this skin earlier ;)

glad to see that u can play better than some of the adults lol, well play especially when trade hit with others, also good timing with super

This......does *Not* put a smile on my face

Literally half my 3v3 games one of my teamates goes afk and a bot replaces them

The balancing is Supercell's work, not mine.  They will balance the countering, not me. It's their game after all.  What will make people rage is the fact that you didn't finish off that one brawler who had 54 hp left. My idea is that the more health you have, the bigger the countering chance. And you only counter when you aim at the attack of the enemy ( -----&gt; &lt;-------- like this)
---
I wasnt really gone, i just pretended to be
---
Bull is more close range like hunter + they both look alike
---
Bull is my name bush camping is my game.

Thanks,I guess

Ok need to meme this

Both days this weekend they discounted skins. This might be a trend and they will rotate though more skins soon.   
---
So if you have limited gems and have other skins in the game you like more it might be worth waiting for other offers.   
---
Boom box brock is by far his worst skin.
---
I mean,  I thought at lest rule 34 doesn't have foot fetish. Guess we got our first move towards this.
---
thank you! &lt;3

Magic archer is bo

thank you so much!

Me too, I miss him a lot.

that's very kind of you :') thank you

They got Poco for starters. Not sure who else would be worth adding to fit the theme.
---
I already have it. But you never know, there is always next Christmas. You think supercell will make them exclusive instead of bringing them back to make more money?
---
what?

When he goes invisible he should dive into the ground. And also, add a Fin on the TOP of his hoodie, other than that, skins lookin like üî•üî•üî•

they said it's a one time offer and never coming and this is our last chance idk if they are going to bring it back or no the only ones that i want are royal agent colt and dumpling darryl
---
No bro, tooo easy
---
It's winter here in the southern hemisphere
---
I think Rockstar colt is better imo. I did pick up Darryls skin though.
---
Give me back my shovel
---
NO TITLE
---
My best assumption is that since Boom Box Brock uses the same idle animation as regular Brock, the hat for Boom Box Brock is like the sunglasses for normal Brock, so that's probably why it's upwards since the sunglasses for normal Brock in his idle animation is upwards.
---
Lesson:Dont play crow like a bull.
---
NOOB is my name ,  What.da.ef Is my game

I mean she is one of the best big brawlers but dynamike is not someone you expect to last long

Please stop making drake meme templates
---
r/suddenlyAgoal
---
i was 79 gems and i wanted darryl skin badly but i didn't got the gem then after they dissapeared guess what poped up from a brawl box it was 12 gems i was so sad
---
Bearly funny
---
All tanks have the same movement speed and Shelly isn‚Äôt a tank.
---
Suprisingly, i took the shot BEFORE I pressed proceed!
---
I mean piper and mortis are good
---
Its not a glitch it happens and kairos was correct.
---
No man piper is awesome, you just play bad
---
Botany, but I like the way u think ;)
---
Same
---
Exactly! I pushed about 30 trophies on Piper in duo showdown!
---
Nice job!
---
The worst is people wasting ammo in brawl ball after the other team scores. Like yeah. I know. I messed up. It happens. Regroup and use that ammo maybe to kill someone.
---
Deserves more upvotes....MORE
---
Why only midnight players? Add the option to dark theme or light theme
---
Same I don't hear botany at all lol
---
Lmao me too I've been trying to get Tara power cubes for a long time. So far I have I have ten.
---
That‚Äôs me when I try to dodge but get hung up with the skeleton bones on the ground...  kill the bones!!!
---
Gem grab
---
Lol what?
---
Never trust anybody
---
Piper's best game mode is bounty! If you think she's bad on that, then you can't hit people and dodge well enough to not get killed
---
I really like the idea of this map, it looks like something supercell would make
---
Green for me
---
How many trophies on piper did you have on this replay ?
---
7 Months of playing......
---
And I just noticed this
---
I'm saying the skin
---
Also 1 Xubee
---
Beep Beep
---
OK.....
---
You should know that some brawlers are meant to be at the back and some maps are for long rangers
---
I'm a sheep

Nice portrait

No just got him a few days ago its power 3
---
Leon is my name nerf is my game
---
I said beep beep
---
Huh

Statistically, it‚Äôs entirely possible that you don‚Äôt get it in 200 boxes. It‚Äôs more likely that you would get it, but not impossible
---
That matchmaking tho
---
I said grammar, not spelling
---
Tara is tornado
---
I can't believe it's not GEDI-KOR!
---
I just don‚Äôt see why your being so toxic. You have your own opinion and then bashed on this dudes.
---
Lol
---
I'm not
---
You sir just appeared on brawl tv
---
SHANG TSUNG
---
Try a harder bait next time, this one's too obvious
---
Nice. Since solos isn't a good mode to push above 500, how do you manage to push to 600+ on a single brawler? Using duos or 3v3?
---
It's just Ricochet's losing animation (seriously i miss him)
---
Now this seems like a cool map!
---
But the arrows are red, so it's upvotes but in another perspective
---
El Primo is pleased with this representation of bis childhood years.
---
Rosa is basically a primo with lower hp and a longer range and what was primo's essential before rosa came out? #GEMCARRIER
---
What bait
---
Nope
---
darryl best mode is actually showdown, i used a mixture of duos and solos as darryl is just so strong that he bypases the teamers easily, i coudl actually push him further but i'd rather push my new brawlers that are like 200 trophies (bibi and leon)
---
I used to think that sometimes they matched us with bots because I didn't think it's humanly possible to be that dumb. I learnt that I underestimated humanities capabilities

That‚Äôs just brawl tv.

I just want   his skin ideas implemented in the game.I dont really give much support on hiring.But it a sad thing that untill now ,supercell has published its own skin....Bakesake barley,Hot rod brock,night witch mortis,touchdown bull.Nobody ,nobody ever expected these skin would come.No one was expecting it.Supercell kind of makes its own content in other words.except for tara and valentines poco were taken from reddit.

But... does it happen often at higher trophies? I‚Äôm pretty confused because my Jessie was only at ~400 trophies but I still appeared on brawl tv?
---
A book isnt read that way though
---
Every point of damage the bats deal, it will heal him that much. So if the bats deal 3000 damage, it will heal him 3000 health
---
He gets brawlers to 500 and then tilts them to 30 then moves to the next one
---
Thanks, i hate elongated penny
---
Stolen, you just put a slightly different template
---
Thanks
---
that's my first ever comment :D
---
On that day, someone wanted a speed nerf on Crow's super.
---
reeeee
---
my friend immediately hated them because he used to play fortnite and was good at it. When he first matched against teamers, this guy was roasting them the whole time. (big talk for losing to them)
---
Guys, i have given this person permission to post my meme
---
Leon never got buffed???
---
That‚Äôd be cool if there was a brawler who could remove other brawlers available super
---
Buy this skin!
---
Your that happy for a skin, that's a shallow life my friend
---
Thtat looks way too realistic
---
The skill you had was INCRE√çBLE!
---
Bull looking thicc
---
*everywhere
---
madlad
---
Why is everyone in this thread acting like this is not intentional? It‚Äôs a good player who is gettin his brawlers to Rank 20 and then purposefully tilting them to 30 trophies
---
Using a meme template isn‚Äôt stealing?
---
 Never noticed that. Welp I guess that ends my question. I just got him yesterday (from a box)
---
Thank you
---
u mean Pam?
---
You are right! But it was very common to pull 1-5 elixir from boxes. Pulling 10 was considered legendary rarity.
---
CLOWN MORTIS
---
No
---
Piper and bo should be reversed
---
The well known fortnite streamer, Ninja usually leaves the game when he fights, to not to die to the enemy!
---
Argentinians: are we a joke to you
---
A draw of Frank
---
Too late to do that now
---
Lol you could say that. It sorta sucks though since once a brawlers at 500, you don't want to play them really.
---
When Poco goes Loco
---
I remember when Geometry Dash added these and I loved it.
---
but if they added some emoticons like in clash royale that would be cool
---
More like the enemies were secretly storm troopers
---
*I don‚Äôt feel so good, Mr Mortis*
---
But you get rewards for the more trophies you have
---
Glad you found out!
---
Pretty cool
---
What's wrong with that skin?
---
Hey you copied soul knight
---
Penny is the only one super rare brawler which is not a robot
---
It will, but it's gonna heal like, 100 hp
---
*T H I C C
---
MSpaint 100
---
If you catch a brawler, you can kill him with AA easily, but it's not so simple to catch, nobody who is at least slightly skilled will go to a bush without checking and tanks are trash at long range.
---
By the way, flair doesn't check out
---
I can't look it went let me
---
I feel like these should be coins instead, I don't think people want 70 gems for just somebody to die differently.
---
It still can't beat one pull....
---
Legendary pull
---
Where are you from? Are you Italian? (Because you wrote "arraffagemme" instead of gem grab)
---
With or without star power
---
Reload Time:
---
Is like Tara's
---
Alakazzam:Daisy can reflect enemy projectiles for 3.5sec but takes 60%damage.
---
Super Dazzles: Super Dazzles follow another target after hitting an enemy and have a bit faster speed.
---
I suppose but, nothing I can't get from just opening boxes it's one thing when it's a brawler you can only get on trophy road like Bo but after that it's all stuff you already get in boxes just a little more of it like my next reward is 25 gold coins..... yay
---
Spikes super is more acurate (or shelly star power)
---
Thanks!
---
Sorry for reposting I wanted more people to see this ideaüòÑ
---
and tara is rare
---
I don‚Äôt see why this would hurt u lol... if SC adds a remove AA feature to a FRIENDLY game then why does it impact you? Just play with AA on. All I‚Äôm saying is removing AA would help the 3v3 environment so brawlers that can AA every shot (such as Gene/Carl) that shouldn‚Äôt be able to would get nerfed, but only in friendlies, so it wouldn‚Äôt impact ladder at all
---
Its unfair only tara has ine
---
The sniper bot is ricochet
---
Legendary chance too high, -50 trophies too much, +50 trophies too much.
---
Maybe instead of a special animation (that would take a lot of space and development time) Star players will have a spinning trail around the brawlers for the ‚Äòmatch end‚Äô screen
---
Do you think it would be better?
---
Barley is also poison spell
---
Me nine
---
And most of them are KIDS
---
Ah, I see you're a man of culture as well
---
Leon toes ü§§ü§§ü§§
---
And how many mods will be added?
---
Actually how about fireworks behind the star player
---
Apart from the template the text literally has nothing to do with brawl stars. I‚Äôm confused why so many people upvoted this
---
I'm just saying that core mechanics should not be affected in any way.
---
LoL
---
This idiot just reposts another person's post
---
Why not? Plus AA isn‚Äôt even a core mechanic
---
Yep, when I saw the spinning brawler I honestly thought it was Leon, but no, it was Spiky Boi
---
Not like you'll ever see it
---
Except this one...
---
STOP ASKING FOR UPVOTES!!!
---
No but that‚Äôs fair
---
That sounds like a great strategy! If you were going with randoms, who would be best to go in blind with?
---
Me and the boys 3 shotting the primo
---
So my device does not have a screen recorder, so I had to use another phone to record the replay. When I tried to post the video to reddit from the phone, but there was no option for videos. So I had to record the recording of the replay on my original phone in order to post it to reddit. That means I was forced to post a video of potato quality recording potato quality. Sorry about that.
---
I just don‚Äôt feel this one sorry!
---
THANKS
---
Yeah until you realize this was a sponsored stream by Fortnite streamers
---
What is this shitty post?
---
Penny is always a safe pick for me, barley is also really strong if you know how to zone people
---
Dude we just want a reload speed buff and a star power buff but then somebody else said we should also get a damage buff so idk what to believe in anymore
---
Your post has been removed, make sure to use the body of a post to elaborate on the title.
---
Depends on the quality of the applicants. Don't want to give a secure range just yet.
---
Dude im getting there too mega excite. (At like 6500)
---
Wow
---
ALERT! SENTRY BUSTER IS COMING!
---
Because it‚Äôs fan art?
---
LETS TAKE BACK THE THRONE!!! But keep in mind fellas we also gotta help the people over in r/MortisGang
---
"AlExA stOp Pls"
---
Yes, but why should Poco be Chara? Explain.
---
I was thinking more like star powers. Not exchangable between brawlers.
---
I love wii sports corruptions lol
---
Give Archero some credit
---
I also dont know what trophy count you are at, or brawler levels, but I have a power 10 barley at 350 trophies and win siege with him the majority of the time when I go in with randoms, the only is when randoms dc and then we lose
---
Crow invasion
---
Fet-his pic-tu-re.
---
its not that much
---
Reminds me of Leon since his helmet covers his eyes.
---
At least he shoots 4 rockets with his rocket launcher unlike Brock.
---
I may have to change my flair
---
Who
---
Lol, I just realize what flair your using.
---
Not simetrical
---
My english is like a shit
---
Wait really?
---
Yeah and if only new posts weren't neglected
---
Very good idea.
---
An auto aim character who is camping I MEAN ... Star Shelly
---
Darryls mad
---
Now 99 brawl stars 1 redit
---
Bro they‚Äôre all really accurate, if it wasn‚Äôt sparky there wouldn‚Äôt be any other card you can compare to, this post was really well made!
---
I'm going down the line and I'm scared for pocoüò¨
---
They really should
---
Mortis doesn‚Äôt need a buff, he needs a slight rework to his attack so that he doesn‚Äôt get blocked by a wall easily
---
Too...cute.. must...punch something.
---
maybe add secrets for both sides the normal version and dark mode
---
Sad that low effort shitposts get thousands of upvotes on this sub but good quality concepts like this and art get barely any
---
It sounds like botany if you listen to it but it sounds two syllabled. Like botny
---
Hi fellow south Indian!
---
Underrated post
---
Oh oh evil robo
---
So master builder is related to our rico,barley and bots.
---
I also got 26 seconds
---
Muchos gracias!
---
Don't worry I checked
---
He looks super friendly I like it!
---
Go to r/brawlstars and click 3 dots on top right on your screen, select "choose flair" and select your brawler
---
I didnt really think about it, but it was really weird that the master builers go, where could he possibly go? 
---
Maybe to the city... too retropolis?
---
Im dony think they will add just a 6th builder in the main base
---
i'm at 300 with mortis, not the easiest to push tbh, I don't play with randoms with it for obvious reasons. Usually play with my friends and it kinda works, Mortis obviously die sometimes but it works
---
You‚Äôre absolutely idiotic for putting a hole in your wall over a phone game
---
Amazing. You're great at blending colors.
---
Thanks! And I appreciate the feedback. You mean the full body image of Daisy? If that then very soonüòÅ
---
Good but the spawns are a bit unfair
---
Yes it happens often on brawl tv in the high trophies area
---
Is thaat goose??
---
Im glad I keep arriving early. At least on the first and third. Keep it up! Unless these are the last brawlers...
---
The vast majority of players have no issues with autoaim actually. I have no issue with it in casual gameplay but players at the top want a small nerf for it in high trophy gameplay only to make the game more skilled.
---
Haha, but seriously great concept, definitely needs to be in game
---
Brawl Ball.
---
Best audio
---
As a R&amp;M fan and a Brawl Stars fan, I approve.
---
You wouldn't want mine... It's all... Yucky...
---
Like Neo ^^
---
GG man !!!
---
I don‚Äôt get spike and Nita?
---
Sad but true
---
Nup, this was yesterday
---
exactly right? and more like soccer irl
---
Yea good job, there's no thing such as "Bad Art", and + you do better than half of us, including me so good job.
---
They might be last
---
Bring him back :¬¥(
---
Tbh now that i look at the picture to me it looks like purely made by supercell if only the buttons are a little better alligned
---
Why is there a star power toggle if you can go up to level 10 in the brawler settings?
---
Me: dies
---
Spike because it‚Äôs green and throws stuff (kinda bad) and witch for Nida because she does splash damage and spawns stuff, and mini pekka for the bear
---
Its for bots if you look at the text
---
Me too a lot
---
how are you gonna announce the chosen redditors?
---
This may look like a good map but trust me long range will dominate here
---
Mordarreon
---
None of them because I'm f2p and broke af
---
Turret time!
---
Tbh i'm jealous of that editing skill, what did you use for it and how tf did you find/use the font?
---
Nah Seige is the easiest mode to push trophies in
---
This post: *exists
---
Musketeer as Piper: ‚ÄúAm I a joke to you?‚Äù
---
So fu%$ing true
---
It should be his spine, so he is an invertebrate and should be falling apart
---
omg I just got an idea - what if we get Brawl Stars x Clash of clans collab/crossover like the Clash Royale event but this time we'll get the Master Builder as a new brawler because from the video he was leaving the Builder Base.
---
Tara needs a remodel before she can get skins, that's why Tara isn't getting any. But the real F in chat should go Bo. Bo was there when the game released, got remodeled 2 months ago and STILL doesnt have a skin. Bo is the only brawler in the game who was there when the game launched and still doesn't have a skin
---
I did musketeer and mortar as penny
---
Wow haven't played Clash Royale in so long I keep thinking musketeer is like shelly, a shotgunner.
---
Leon does not need a buff, Nita and mortis need them
---
Ah, thanks!
---
Play Losing Showdown theme cover piano
---
But his range is already so wide that he can easily strafe in a wide pattern side to side and still hit you
---
Rico - Problem Occured - (Uses super) - Problem bounced away
---
How?
---
I've thought of this idea before to his Soper would be a blast of lava that flies from out of his head
---
I like the event modifiers because it adds another element but there should be a plain version w/o as well
---
Reasons why this map is bad:
---
1. Too many bushes that is hard (impossible) to check
---
2. Spawn location unfairness
---
3. Uneven chest spawning location
---
(Too many chests spawn at places with bush)
---
4. The name of this map is wrong it should be renamed to ‚Äòbull-Shelly paradise 2.0‚Äô
---
At least there is less teaming than usual in this map
---
That pic is the stuff of nightmares. . .
---
Yeah, you're right. I'll just probably shut up
---
Overwatch made money off cosmetics, not p2w features. I would gladly pay *money* for a non p2w Supercell game.
---
üò≠üò≠
---
True.... I‚Äôll cover for 2k players then
---
r/antiduriusbrawlsatrs
---
Hurry and waste ur money üòÇ
---
It‚Äôs definitely stolen art. Take a look at the profile.
---
If you have to worry about missing him, you're probably too close.
---
I.e. Brock, Colt, Piper, Penny, Gene, etc. will all hit him outside his range. Primo, Rosa, Bull, Shelly will all be too close to miss or to far to hit. Only midrange brawlers like Nita or Carl would have to worry about that.
---
Wow That's open
---
I mean, I view them less as classes and more as ‚Äòunique‚Äô titles. I doubt anyway besides Bibi will be another Batter
---
TARA WANTS TO KNOW YOUR LOCATION
---
This is so cute*^*
---
Penny, and Rosa: Are we a joke to you?
---
How do you backstab with Poco??
---
It‚Äôs supposed to be something you think is true but many people disagree with, like back in the day when buff crow was a meme you‚Äôd right ‚Äú crow doesn‚Äôt actually need a buff you guys just suck ‚Äú or something song those lines. If this was supposed to be satirical then you should make that more clear because I couldn‚Äôt really tell and I‚Äôm sure many others couldn‚Äôt either.
---
That‚Äôs that one evil spike boi
---
Thats how you know colt needs a buff, the only reason ppl dont complain is bc he has a high dps for his range but he is not good in bushes and he is not good long range and only good at mid range (if you hits atleast most of the shots consecutively)  dont get me wrong im at 7.3k and colt is my favorite brawler thats why i got him to 535 last season (185 place for USA) was hard tho
---
It's actually his pie-baking wife. They are old so they have to take turns in the arena.
---
Beautiful....
---
I never added anything to the server. I only downloaded it and then toke a screenshot of the sniper bot.
---
Stand power: flying fist
---
Wait until they're low health and kill them
---
Dynamike likes being choked üò©üò≥
---
And that‚Äôs is a great idea may I say
---
Tbh I don‚Äôt play siege at all
