yeah maybe i should‚Äôve worded my title better bc i can see how i come off as really whiny. Not really karma hungry otherwise I‚Äôd say ‚Äúguys i just played chief pat in SD‚Äù or something along the lines of that. I only spin when I greatly outweigh them in power cubes in the final 2 just to have fun, never just to rub it in someone‚Äôs face.

thats true however I haven't played with a single bad crow

Taras will understand too.

Aye I created Sabrina in the bottom right! Ur doing a great job m8 keep going!

Then make it charge 25% of super instead of 33.3%, that way it looks more like 4 shots to get a super. It‚Äôs just a astetic change

We did get back to back updates. Also you do know they have a small team of like 10-15 people. Making back to back updates is hard. Plus with supercell making a second HQ (IRL) they are slowed down. Plus all of there games got a massive update including us. Give them like another month to rest and do there thing.

Personally I think that you‚Äôre overreacting a bit, the situation that you‚Äôre talking about in 400+ (90% of my brawlers are already at 500+) used to happen to me probably like once in 25 matchups, not as common as you make it sound .

---
The entire concept of pay-to-win, which is widely criticized due to being unfair, is that a game allows players to pay for upgrades in a manner in which they have a better chance of winning a game. The most common form of this is paying to avoid a grind. If you think pay-to-win is in anyway fair, you're very much in the minority.
---
You need to play more games if you think trophies don't reflect skill. It's just like any other system where you have a rise and a fall of any sort of level. Eventually you'll reach a point where it reflects a player's skill. Sure, up to 1000-2000 trophies and that may be true. But eventually you'll reach a point where it's a very good reflection of player's skill levels. It's not like other systems that only grant you a reward (commonly XP) and thus are more of a reflection of how much someone has played rather than skill level. But again, because this system has a punishment for losing, it very much is a good system to reflect skill. Not sure what population of the game has to do with anything unless you're going to start comparing their skill levels.

Definitely not. Sure, in a one v one against a bull is instant death but his super is arguably better than bull‚Äôs. Distance wise, he does more damage if you‚Äôre not like up to his face.

As for shelly, you can dodge her super if you time it right.

You just got to use your intuition and don‚Äôt use him like an invincible tank. Time it right.

Well, thanks for clarifying. I WAS talking about 1 and 2/3 trophy loss (5 trophies spread out across 3 brawlers) which to me was what was being implied if it became a trophy event and trophy gain would not be too efficient. Siege is "twice as long" but in reality the game usually ends at the 3rd siege, making it too efficient at trophy gain.

It's real look at the posts of other players.

Amazing idea! But I‚Äôd rather have a duo-wingman style game were it is 2 players per side. Overall, great Idea
---
So you switch accounts for every artwork? Idk man seems fishy.
---
Good! Is this one separate from the trophy road?
---
There are a lot of "useless" star powers, but Tara's not one of them. Colt's increased speed is completely unnoticeable and Piper's increased damage is only active at unusual moments, for example. Tara's star power can be useful to kill someone with low hp when you are out of ammo.
---
Its depend of the Brawler you are playing, if you are playing Pam for example, you just have to unnistall the game. Same with the other 22 characters...

This is kinda like passage but with less water

Probably with less teaming though

Almost as thicc as thiccochet

I can finally grind brock to rank 15
---
No I stopped playing it because it was dead not because I thought it was dead...its popularity on youtube, twitch and other social medias was going down, even the player base decreased, thats why it was dead and a lot of players switched to fortnite anyways so I did too and now a days I play brawl stars and fortnite.

Give this man some gems, even I did not think of that. You‚Äôre a genius!

But for efficient trophies pushing they would probably want win/lose 6 due to the fact this mode could be the new longest game mode since it could go up to 5 matches. Even if they are quick it could take a while

---
NAME.
---
Grabber. 
---
Rarity. 
---
Legendary 
---
Thrower. 
---
Description.   
---
Grabber is a small robot created in a facility owned by a kid Jessie however the robot made it's way out by his grappel that he has on the top of his metal body 
---
HP power level 10. 3510  
---
His shoot. NAME. Rocket throw. 
---
 Grabber throws one rocket per ammo from his mouth looking weapon connected on his body doing 1350 damage at power level 10 Which emedietly explodes. He gets another ammo room after 1.4 seconds 
---
Super.  Name. Escape grappel. 
---
When grabber uses his super he uses his grappel hook that he has in the top of his metal body allowing him to move 2.5 cm further. He can also jump over walls and stuff like that. If he lands o n an enemy it only does 500 damage. 
---
He becomes it after 4 or 5 normal hits have hit an enemy. 
---
Star power. When grabber uses his escape grappel before he goes in the air he leaves one small rocket like Piper doing only 700 but also stunning them for 1.5 seconds.  
---
Let me know if I missed something but I hope it's good
---
I am

Tfw certain people get this offer and automatically cashes in. Meanwhile, me getting the coin offer...

Picture did not post

Should be 49 gems instead of 60
---
I have three new fighters
---
Great idea, but you would need a very specific map or at least make it timed so that once you‚Äôre down one brawler you don‚Äôt just hide behind a wall for 2 minutes till your opponent gives up
---
Found the random that makes me lose every siege match
---
why would it be a duck? it makes no sense
---

Looks cool üëèüëè
---
1000000
---
Sent to the scrapyard!
---
Still I have some other post I didn't spend that much time and they're lower effort than this one
---
I think the map should be a lot smaller because with this size, there‚Äôs too many spots to just hide and that could make this game mode very long.
---
Not worth it cuz 1 mega box equals 10 brawl boxes and u get 1000 token doubler for 50 gems which results in 10 brawl boxes.
---
Despite that u can Defo go for the 49 gems offer which appear quite often for a mega box
---
Could have just caught the ball without jumping it was right in your way
---
TiMe tO dOwnVoTe tHis NiBbA

You‚Äôre missing the purpose of the game mode which is 1v1. If you add 4 CPUs you‚Äôre changing the entire concept it‚Äôs not longer a 1v1 because those CPUs can change the game rather easily
---
Awesome concept!
---
nononononono crow was the worst legendary before release, as tara was better than him. now his poison can be extremely useful and can kill easily

Very good, you're good at drawing, I like it

Amazing, respect

It was happened with me:)

If you were my teammate you would have jumped on the jessie instead

Ikr. I don't even know why is he complaining. If he doesn't like it then DM Tim and tell him to take it out of the video
---
if i wasn‚Äôt broke i would give you gold
---
Oops
---
If there is a battle pass, I highly agree it should be f2p friendly. One of the things that was bad in fortnite was this feeling of the us, the f2p users with boring default skins, and the them, those who bought the pass and got all this cool stuff. I really disliked the idea, but if there is a battle pass it should follow these guidelines, or otherwise there should be no battle pass.
---
Here birdie birdie birdie. Makes so much more sense now
---
Penny's Star Power is OP in Bounty Layer Cake and Gem Grab Chill Cave
---
If anyone plays TanksALot...... you should know this is basically Venom
---
Airdrop Inbound!
---
That would not be balanced. Power cube farming would becoming a thing, high cube teams would earn above 10 trophies, and so on. Supercell has also stated before that changing how trophies are rewarded in showdown would change the focus of the mode and they don't want that.
---
I have 6.6k trophies and no legendary. I really want a new brawler now after 2 months off nothing in my boxes :(
---
And when i steam witsh randoms we are the fkrst team to die
---
How in the world did this get gold already?
---
Just speak their language.
---
Pam needs a nerf-Pam is hard to counter because of her x
---
We need to stop teaming-teaming as a strategy is unfair to other players
---
Crow needs a nerf- jk lol git gut scrubz
---
...
---
What?
---
I can relate to the "Crow needs the Buff" laugh.
---
It's more like "CrOw NeEdS a BuFf!1!1!"
---
It was the same for me, but I got spike and gene in the same week a few weeks ago (then later Carl who I bought when he came out). I just got back to max points a few days ago and it feels good to get a lot of coins again
---
Some of my propositions:
---
1. Old Lobber
---
2. Lenny
---
3. Nickel
---
The reason for this may be if you are inviting two people but change to duo or solo showdown, since there would then be less slots, I'm assuming
---
No, it's a mortar :/
---
Not seeing how?
---
It‚Äôs not what you said but more how you said it. As if players aren‚Äôt entitled to spend in game currency however they want.
---
Her name is Shadow Tara.
---
Primo &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Carl
---
Scrappy doesn't have eyes either.
---
Carl needs a buff too
---
#BuffCrowandCarl
---
Yeah, its weird, i opened just ten boxes and got only coins and 700 coins, more than megabox
---
Duo
---
It is possible, that guy has proof on youtube
---
More like very beneficial. Since it‚Äôs 1v1 everyone is random. And those crap randoms will be your new trophies.
---
Matchmaking is broke
---
I don‚Äôt think Supercell wants to get sued by DC comics
---
Epic
---
Interesting. As a compliment to Tara or Frank? I'm gonna try out some combos.
---
Well then i have 500 colt and 500 shelli
---
Leon and Nita have fursonas
---
That's the weird shift after max points, you start to prefer normal boxes over mega boxes since they reward more. The mega box *says* ten but I don't trust it, the single boxes give more coins compared to it
---
Hear hear
---
Thanks, Should I present the map to MAMM?
---
He says ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt touch my canary‚Äùso....

Gunk shot sounds oddly sexual.

Lol #GrammarNazis
---
From the original commercial for brawl stars back in beta, nice
---
Yeah, i even tested it by saving 10 and buying a megabox, also could you add me ingame, you seem to be a good guy
---
Only people who passed 10th grade will understand
---
Well i pushed colt shelli and barli on 500 now i planing to push brock
---
Yep. I second this.
---
Okey I would recommend evening it out and not having 3 characters at 500. I‚Äôm currently at 5.3 K throphies and only have Leon at 500. Like 11/18 of my characters are at 300 and up.
---
Rico, Rico , Rico and Colt, Mike, Mike and I just wont 12  trophies against you
---
8.3k no legendaries, legendary chance:0.1560....
---
Don‚Äôt say anything or I‚Äôll steal your food at lunch
---
Link the said proof please.
---
This Joke/post has already been made on this subreddit.
---
Lol alright
---
I really like to make update ideas and I have a Brawlstars Telegram Sticker Pack. I need the fan kit to make these things
---
Alright
---
Sounds cool but might be overpowered. If this brawler actually came into the game, chances are that the damage and super will be nerfed
---
This one is in the house.
---
I can almost hear him saying 'You c*nt!' (Dunno why he is british in my mind tho)
---
You forgot he didn‚Äôt forget (kinda)
---
Thank you very much\^\^
---
I imagine using Darryl super into that water.
---
Frank said its name is Bruce
---
I'd buy this as soon as I could, but sadly I got a 340 coin offer on my mini. My main already had Mortis.
---
What's next Shelly shootout
---
This happens to almost every player. I‚Äôve been playing for 4 months and I already have 21/24 brawlers, and 2 are legendary
---
The golden era... rip.
---
Yes please
---
How? I'm at 6.3k trophies and I don't even have any brawler at level 8
---
Solid post
---
I played since early beta
---
I did 130 at a time with my friend and one random. #dreamteam
---
Thank you!
---
The tables have turned.
---
I'm glad you liked it üòä But my art skills are not so good so it doesn't look so great. Would love it if Gedi-kor did these skin ideas but unfortunately it's just me
---
The offer was taken down after 5 mins
---
The day a Brawler freezes me for 3 seconds while meteors fall on me...I am uninstalling.
---
If this balance were to be broken...
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
(Deltarune reference.)
---
Hopefully they update it next update, I have a feeling they will do it when all the brawlers are remodeled, which I hope is the next update :)
---
Totally agree.
---
fuck ... thats bad luck , I got 3 brawlers when i opened 2 mega boxes
---
I‚Äôm happy about getting Crow but my chances for unlocking him? No. I don‚Äôt want it to be this easy for me to unlock brawlers so easily as its ruining the fun.
---
I will probably get downvoted, but I don‚Äôt get why people want old skins back. The characters were remodeled for a reason, because their old models were very unpolished. The only reason why Supercell would add it is because of a quick buck.
---
I hope so too
---
Yeah, and these glidersn they surely copied crow's wings!
---
Yesssss
---
Congratulations and may you have lots of karma in your future
---
Ive had the last seige and lost the game. Its not fun.
---
Hi Ethan...look to your left. You see that little bitch? Remember him when people need to get out of that emergency exit next to you.
---
Ballin
---
I didn't say night mode,i said dark mode.
---
My life is complete
---
How tf yiu played with 20 trophies people
---
Nah, I think everyone‚Äôs goal is the 150 coin bonus! Incredible!
---
I congratulate thee
---
The text is what the brawlers is saying
---
Please only in Showdown
---
Other modes are balancing (Siege is a different situation) and I feel like it doesn't fit.
---
Yeah just stay back and poison ppl
---
lmao u r right XD
---
Thanks for the support, but it's never gonna happen to me.
---
Limited Time Brawlers can be a great addition
---
Like you can only unlock them for a limited time and then it would be impossible to unlock after the event is over
---
If you continue to hit play again, sometimes this happens. But usually it only happens to players with a lot of trophies. I‚Äôve seen YouTube videos of a 3 Leon team. I don‚Äôt know why this happened at such a low trophy count
---
But Thanos can make it happen.
---
cuz it's not
---
Bravo ii zici la ma-ta manca mi ai pula
---
Damn right got him on my mini and pushed him to 500 power 1 in 5 days
---
MONEY 
---
 =&gt;
---
making the game more p2w instead of balanced among other things 
---
people will be happier if they put more money and fuck f2p
---
A bull did that to me last second and died I have it recorded if you wanna see it
---
haha
---
Trying to get his doctorate
---
You can't really max an account under 3000 trophies now unless you got all current trophy road brawlers before Trophy Road was introduced
---
nice!
---
That account is one of my alts Im trying to max at 0 trophies... Going to take a while but not that long if things like this happen ;)
---
This was a great day for me cuz I got mortis for 19 on 3 accounts, and got 2 more 500s on my main
---
Oh,yeah! Sorry, you are right!
---
Yea ik ill max everything besides those. Unfortunate, but itll be fine
---
imagine opening up a mega box and it says 9 items remaining
---
your knowledge is inferior this conversation is now terminated
---
That's great! Almost thought it was getting spike lol Congrats!
---
0.0384
---
Idk why but this makes me laugh so godamn hard
---
i unlocked frank few weeks ago, got him to 420 cups in like 3 days and i've been too scared to play him since
---
I saw it in another subreddit
---
Hi Ethan! Hope you hit 10k someday soon!
---
Very aggravating when this happen.
---
If this post gets 300 upvotes i am going to post this in r/ClashRoyale
---
I have 0 legendaries and am also at 5.5k
---
I spent about 60$ on the game
---
My chance is 0.07%
---
I agree I have never made a good play on any 400&lt;brawler
---
What does the pot of greed do?
---
It's name will be Lenny
---
Idk I just make memes and I‚Äôve already had 2 posts hidden for saying the forbidden f word
---
Wow dude, you got any trophy pushing tips? I've tried to reach 4k but randoms and teamers took me from 4.8k to 4.6k in a matter if minutes. (But I've had much worse tilts)
---
Comments like these are why people downvote
---
If this is a showdown map, there looks like there is some lucky spots to spawn and ones that are not so lucky.
---
thats a lot of stupid in one comment let me try and break it down

I'm tired of these posts

Needs more jpeg

Sup Ethan!
---
Impossible unless ur extremely lucky or ur at under 100 total trophies and everyone sucks
---
Yes, but it was different! Anyway Thanks!
---
Pam is cancerous in general but two...
---
Good job
---
Why dont they do much damage?
---
You can‚Äôt kill them without taking damage! Especially with brawler like colt who shoot multiple shots per attack.
---
You are kidding me right now, where is my 19 gem MORTIS!!!
---
What do you consider a lot of money?
---
Mortis actually becomes Morte not morti. I took Latin. r/iamverysmart
---
Haha if you look at my profile I also did pekka darryl!
---
His main attack is not over walls. His super is.
---
This is my most popular post? Huh
---
Tbf most people consider any money spent on something free to be ‚Äúa lot of money‚Äù
---
more like wasting super for no reason... but of course people on reddit are  -3000 trophies players so they upvote you.
---
Just got piper
---
They said they weren‚Äôt gonna fix it, so basically yeah
---
Fricking frick
---
This is just like y Dyna
---
I would if you at least spelled brawl stars right lol
---
Thats why I dont play siege with randoms, or not even with friends
---
And yes they did I‚Äôm sure, I forgot where they said it but yes they did say it
---
It'S strategy!1!!
---
Their own words.
---
So then... Better to stay as it are now
---
damn i have all power levels lower than 4 i am 10k
---
Saddest thing I've seen all day

R.I.P FRICK
---
So, (illegal crossover) like an alchemist from Bloons Tower Defense 6.
---
Top path is the alchemist that buffs your team
---
The middle path is the alchemist that is more of offense and power
---
Bottom path is the money path to turn rubber to gold.
---
P.S.- I said up to 4th tiers, the 5th tiers have a unique property's from the 4th tiers.
---
Np
---
It‚Äôs ok
---
I hate it too, but how could they remove teaming? People team by moving, you cant quit moving
---
Yes, but the player uses the same brawler as last round if he wins. And if given the chance to heal its almost certainly an advantage being 3-2/2-1 ahead
---
They maybe remove BO‚Äôs old model and give him a new one.
---
But I like that song üòìüî´
---
Attack: shoots 3 little gears. 
---
Ultimate: throws a big gear breaking walls and pushing the enemies. When it falls, it stays on the ground for 4 seconds blocking the way.
---
Hello there
---
Pam is aggro and control
---
Wait does lolita mean young or youth?
---
32 trophies of work lost right there because I had bad team comps.
---
Use bushes and walls to the advantage, bounty is a TERRIBLE mode to push him in, do NOT use him in bounty!
---
He easily outpowers most brawlers, Darryl, or even shelly sometimes, with the right skill, he can outplay other brawlers, such as Piper or Brock with his super.
---
BOTTOM TEXT
---
the fact it was the trending post for today makes me mad, but yes
---

Enough to be able to max out more than two brawler at 3k trophies

Not when rico‚Äôs use the jump pads, or when your gem carrier stands in the middle waiting for a primo to land on them.

Please tell me how you do this üòÇ

I am to:)
---
Easy : 
---
Dyna teams -&gt; mortis
---
Barley teams -&gt; mortis and primo
---
This ain't brawlhalla chill lol (jk good idea tho üòâ)
---
Frank is the most fun brawler imo
---
Penny is a swash buckler from Darryl's pirate brigade, or at lest I believe so...
---
Or private servers
---
I accidentally looked up piper now I can‚Äôt Unlook it up!!¬©
---
Please enlighten me
---
Nao sei se √©s pt ou br mas olha um nome bom : zBurst

If it was I don‚Äôt remember it.

Sucks how literally you‚Äôll never be able to watch that match again
---
 r u kidding me mate i am IceMan too wtf -\_-
---
at 8.15k
---
Yeah :(
---
What happened? Was SuperCell hungover because this isn't them.
---
(Joke) No its Samsung that's why the quality is bad.
---
No I didn‚Äôt mean that as some sort of furry thing, I was talking about actual birds. I have a couple of parrots and am absolutely fascinated by birds.
---
255 is imposible
---
Vertical down vertical up
---
If you call being killed during mid attack animation fun, then yea.
---
I'd buy 30 gems for this
---
What have you brought upon this cursed land.
---
git gud
---
haven‚Äôt gotten a brawler in 4 months and my luck value is literally 0.196
---
Thank you üòÑ
---
This is a very rare video of an El Primo using his super smartly.
---
r/engrish
---
That's a fact.
---
I agree, sometimes I want to see but can't!
---
Remember that these are just recommendations, you don't actually need to do this.
---
Maybe make the bushes in the middle thinner, so that there would not be that much cover and dodging bullets would be just that little bit harder.
---
Would be fun to have a game mode that would actually reward good individual performance
---
I think no other brawlers should have DoT (poison damage) other than crow because that‚Äôs the only reason he‚Äôs a legendary.
---
Soy de Argentina y te entiendo, yo a spike lo re tilte√© en una √©poca pero despu√©s de mucho esfuerzo lo recuper√©. Espero que tengas suerte.

Nice map! Looks really fun. What did you use to make the map? What website or app

Oh wow that's great are the ones that can talk don't remember their name.

That‚Äôs him in his natural habitat

Yes i do, a find more friends cuz my clan doesn't play with me buff :(

If you had used anyone else besides Bo you would of lost his star power is good on that map

Wait till you snag an invisible leon

Now look there are a lot of things that can lead to having star powers really early. 
---
1. You paid money to the game ( which i did, opened 3 mega boxes)
---
2. You climbed trophies so slow which means you had opened more trophy boxes and big boxes
---
3. You were really lucky and got a lot of power points for a character you liked and got the star power.
---
None of them happened to me, unluckily. At 3300 trophies i have no character to reach 9 so far. Maybe it's pure unluckiness :/
---
What did you bring a pon this cursed land.
---
Yessss
---
Imagine a circle in which only a character can see everything and you can't lol

So are we suggesting that we spawn both robots at the same time at the end, with their power being based off the bolts, would the stronger robot not win in the middle anyways? And then you got a half dead robot fighting the turret at about the same time everyone else spawns again from the epic battle

That‚Äôs actually a great brawler idea- someone who can multiply themselves as two as their ult:) Upvote this comment to 200 and I‚Äôll make a concept idea)
---
You will quickly realise the only one worthy of the title ¬´¬†legendary¬†¬ª is Spike, since hes the only one viable in any mode that isnt like 3 maps of showdown.
---
How can you be at 3 k in 1 .5 half years? I mean that explains all the maxed brawlers but you know, it's not really that hard climbing. I started 2 months ago and at 3.3k. The game is getting kinda boring to me since i didn't get anything for 50~ boxes now and everyone i come across has star powers which is not really fair.
---
You missed a golden chance to say
