Love the watermark, I really wanna see if any ig pages will try to steal it
---
outfit name: Red Scare 
---
Do you perhaps own an Instagram page for brawl stars?
---
Thanks for listening to my opinion!
---
Number one frustration. Run back and regroup at your base, it's not that hard. Why do they never do it? 
---
I only got in one day spike and el primo
---
No
---
By the way I'm a f2p and I'm at 1600 trophies
---

---
they cant buy it because it will overflow thats why. 
---
He wasn't that bad before global
---
Ah ok
---
I tried that, it didn‚Äôt work üò¢
---
Me too, i quit after they nerf my deck 5 times a row, and got fucking 1.5 year just to maximize one fucking deck &gt;:(((
---
Brawl stars came first 
---
Alien sounds similar to Pam, and the ninja is literally Leon
---
OH YEAH SORRY MY BAD I WASNT AWARE OF THAT SORRY MAN HAVE A NICE NEW YEAR'S EVE
---
Ok that makes sense, I‚Äôm assuming you started at global release since you are 2000 
---
Brock/Frank.
---
True
---
Really??? Now I believe I've got a chance lol
---
I‚Äôve seen these same words in over a million memes. Trashy low effort. 
---
Expect to see this on every brawl stars insta page uncredited ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è good work 
---
genuine question: has anyone else noticed a delay in Darryls shots? After spending a bit trying to play him, I saw that after dragging a shot, there is about a .3-.5 second delay until he fires. Other brawlers like Colt seem to have an instantanious shot after drag. Is this normal?
---
Preregistration LITERALLY doesn't even matter 
---
Anyone played before 2019 gets it üòÇüòÇ
---
No but you could have put it in the dead space of the image rather then placing it in a way that makes it the center of attention.
---
Make it something you unlock at Pwr5?
---
Wheres leon with super ü§î -_-
---
So far, penny and Tara 
---
His star power is inconsistent 
---
He's fine
---
They must do this.It just makes all Brawlers feel unique while playing them
---

Yeah pretty much every single person knows that...

Yes
---
Why Isn't someone calling you cute good thing? :)
---
F
---
What levels were your and his brawler and what brawler was he using?
---
WELL back in beta times there was a time when turrets was stoping from scoring a goal XD
---
The other guy already answered your question but I want advice to not make "mains" like in other games it only slows your progression 
---
I didn‚Äôt know that...üòü
---
dArRyL nEeDs BuFfS

hE CaNt FiGhT lIkE oThEr ShOtGuNnErS
---
No I am a top player that thinks it sucks
---
Its litteraly writen in dynamike's star power.
---
I think he needs a small damage buff. I have a balance wishlist coming in about 2 or 3 days!
---
Not really. Also their projectiles look totally different. 
---
It was a lot better before they had the behind the goal
---
Ok 
---
*Supercell's matchmaking system*
---
Barley can still hit mortis, only dynamike has trouble. 
---
Leon: Best character 
---
Spike: 2nd Best
---
Pam: 3rd Best
---
Oof gl hf
---
wait till the chances hit 0.1 (from past experience)
---
In America, you hunt el primo\\.  In soviet russia, el primo hunt you.
---
In rockwall brawl Leon is definetly the best brawler, crow is also very good, but Primo isn‚Äôt even viable. Other than that I agree with most of the rest of the maps.
---
It was a poco at power 5 I was playing Darryl power 7
---
Tomorrrow surprise in the Shop?!
---
I enjoy it only because i dont have to rely on others so wining or losing is all up to my own skil oppose to the random rishing the enemy spawn with 10 gems
---
*cries in Darryl*
---
leggy
---
wait who made this
---
I think it should be like this:
---
One second of capture equals 10 percent of the time to capture it fully, so 10 secs to fully capture it. It won't take too long to win a match. 2 captures = win.
---
Example: 
---
Blue team captures the point for 5 seconds, and is 50 percent done fully capturing the point. 
---
Red team capture the point for 3 seconds, and instead of resetting all of what blue team has done, it reduces. 50 percent to 20 percent.
---
Blue team captures for 8 seconds, capture complete.
---
Blue team wins the first round.
---
I think this will be more fair and easy overall instead of 60 seconds of capture. I think it would be better if we make it so it's longer to capture the point but this is just an example.
---
Thx for the feedback! I saw primo do decent a few weeks ago, so I decided to put him in. Leon is very good on that map as well. 
---
Yes, please.
---
Nah the super button should be invisible,I guess u can take that as a nerf to Leon 
---
That's pretty dang good
---
GustForce 
---
op, and nice edit
---
Darryl needs a tighter spread or a more consistent one. Pellets miss even in close range.
---
He isnt throwing, it‚Äôs a glitch to get 13:14
---
Big oof you‚Äôre had like 50 upvotes
---
That would be awsome!
---
Yeah, definitely first. Because before we only had 1 every 20 but now we have 3 every 4
---
you most likely won‚Äôt get a legendary still but worth the chance to wait
---
You do know there‚Äôs a wizard barley ? He throws fire projectiles already
---
Great skills 
---
Did you know that golden barley has a Molotov?
---
I have .072 as well :( how many brawlers do you already have?
---
Where do u live ?
---
If El Primo's name was in English, I'd be like "What?" Imagine him saying "The cousin!", or "The rough cousin!". I have no idea if it sounds okay in Spanish, but in English, it would sound so out of place.
---
What does the normal barely throw? Oh a Molotov as well?
---
Normal barely has a Molotov ???
---
Big oof
---
It's 2019
---
the post is still up tho
---
It sounds like suicide
---
How can you tell your chances?
---
Not for me yet, I live on the east coast of the U.S
---
Oh I thought it said reported lol nvm
---
ELLLLLLLLLLLLLLL MATCHING MAKING IS BROKEN PRIMOOOOOOOOOOOO
---
We need a poco skin!! Yes!!
---
It's a very little time to see all's stats and trophies
---
i wish i could get a legendary. at 7k after a year without a single one
---
My legendary chance now is 0,013
---
And have him yell when he spawns "RICO SUAVEEEEE!".
---

You play him like a assassin, go in and do damage then dash out

Yeah^ if they both completely hit, he actually does a good bit of dmg. The only thing is that typically only one of the shots actually hits completely

Except that "every kid" will not be sleeping with someone

And?

Someone already did lel
---
[removed]
---
His attacks need to go out faster bc his second attack typically doesn‚Äôt hit most bullets
---
This is clit, rub my orgasm
---
Ahh your right, they have the same mechanics but instead, maybe the ufo can destroy cover. The ninja can have a slash attack then leading with a super like franks that stuns, but this super stuns people in the vicinity.
---
Brawler name: Horus(or whatever you like !)
---
Character: a cartoony Crane (the bird) with long legs and beak and a hood- black/purple colors.
---
Attack: A purple attack that does damage in a crescent shape, Nita - like damage. This would add a different shaped attack into the game that could be beneficial to apply damage to characters hiding in crevices or fleeing around a corner as well as damage multiple brawlers in an arc. The arc would have a balanced hitbox not too wide or long, similar to Nitas but not quite as short as Primos.
---
Super: Horus throws a (balanced, not too wide hitbox or too fast, about the length of One of Crows darts but in a full line) hook that pulls the first brawler hit towards Horus stunning them for a brief period of time. Imagine seeing the 15 second timer on Gem grab running down as your team rushes to find the pesky Poco holding 14 Gems and hooking him and extending the game with 2 seconds to spare. I feel that this would be a very meta super as this utility would be beneficial across all modes and could add in a new high skill cap shot that could make or break a game. This super could do damage or strictly hook and stun, depending on Supercells opinion.
---
Health- around the same scaling as Nitas health. Slightly lower perhaps. 
---
Skins- Solis - a Sun yellow and orange skin with a fire crescent and hook.
---
Let me know what you think! And if I missed any aspects
---
Lmao he a high skill cap brawler that‚Äôs why you don‚Äôt like him
---
Yeah both barleys have Molotovs. The super has fire but the normal attack is just poison
---
Maybe put the watermark right over your idea so the more cheeky ones don‚Äôt photoshop the part of the screen with the watermark out? I know they are very few in numbers, but they are out there. We have evolved with this watermark, they will evolve too. We must do everything we can to stop them
---
Mom, buy me vbucks
---
Energy drink on double trouble, he‚Äôs good for rolling into the energy drinks
---
Gungeon has been in development for fire years, not two.
---
I‚Äôm thinking it‚Äôs chloroform or some potent drink cuz it has no fire and looks like smoke but yeah Molotov‚Äôs should have fire not a poison or cloud
---
I was thoroughly surprised and disappointed to learn that that is not an actual sub
---
Assuming you never leave games, your team is more likely to benefit from leavers. 
---
The enemy team has 3 potential leavers and your team has 2 potential leavers. The odds should be in your favor to benefit from leavers. 
---
Leon should be top 1-3 for every map, every mode, everything. This is bad info.
---
well, yeah, maybe i'll do that next time, but they also have to find this posts and considering that most posts in the news section are really low effort its goint to be a lot of spam, plus they usually steal the posts sorted by hot, and my posts dont usually get a lot of upvotes so im good üòéüëå
---
Norma attack is poison, but his super has fire
---
He's garbage I wish I never got him 
---
Mortis is so good!!
---
You have it wrong dude, the invisibility isn‚Äôt really the issue with Leon at all. As a matter of fact, His Super should be restored to normal. And they should drastically nerf his damage.
---
His super is strong, don‚Äôt get me wrong, but if he had his super with Piper‚Äôs up close damage, then what would be the problem with it?
---
Leon‚Äôs damage is what‚Äôs so broken about him, it‚Äôs insane, 3-shotting almost every champion. (not el primo or Frank) 
---
His damage defines his role, not his invis.
---
Frankly I think he should get a 20-25% damage nerf, and his ultimate should he returned to how it was prior. (That‚Äôs Enough of a nerf for Bull to beat him) Then he could still get the jump on people, still get invis kills. But not annihilate any brawler, without really any skill required.
---
Are you being sarcastic or no 
---
Yeah, those kids are usually pretty hasty to find some content to copy. Just thinking ahead is all üòâ 
---
He‚Äôs awesome in brawl ball!
---
Please

Me and my friend both got him today!!!

Let a friend that never played brawl stars open like 10 boxes, that way I packed spike and now leon.

Nah, I called him Ricochet, and in spanish Rico is Rich

So what if the skin comes back a year later... by the time that happens everyone who paid for it the first time is over that skin anyways. That is why Fortnite is so successful in selling skins. You can make money off those holiday skins once a year off of a new crowd. As far as people complaining, who cares... they already have your money,
---
Daora üëå
---
I got power 7 mortis to 500+. Just play with bots to practice dribbling in brawl ball, and if you prefer showdown then wait until hot maze and grind it out. With mortis, you need to learn to juke effectively without wasting all your ammo and learn which brawlers you have good matchups against (barley, dynamike, etc.)
---
Wow, was excited for a mythic and the general consensus is the I got is terrible. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
And have good pingüòÇ
---
Didn't you pre register? That's your fault 
---
my fastest is 14, i think ive seen lower then 14 as well
---
Showdown getting top 4 by hiding and running. 
---
this would make pushing very very very easy.
---
I like the idea. Any idea to quicken the progression and unlocking of new cards.
---
At least in Clash Royale unlocking cards comes pretty easy, even if climbing is slow. 
---
In Brawl Stars, you can literally be 6-9k, put a few hundred hours in and not have every character, or not even close. My f2p friend is 7K with no legendaries and without most mythics, and missing one super rare. 
---
That‚Äôs ridiculous.
---
No easy
---
Wow!! Respect this looked so fast for me I didn‚Äôt it was possible to do better
---
People would go triple leon
---
or you can just be like everyone else and just call him rico... just like dynamikes name for most ppl is just mike....
---
Coachflapjack is coming for you. (Is that his name... can‚Äôt remember. Sorry)

Poco, too bad he sucks at my favourite gamemode 
---
hahaha OK whatever ig üòÇ
---
If you haven't noticed, all of the brawlers names aren't just random (Colt is a gun irl, Morti means to die in I guess it was France) and ricochetting means that a object (usually bullet) bounces off things. So, although it would be simpler, changing his name to Rico would take away the point of his name...
---
I hear ya. I have mains in the sense that I use like 5 main brawlers because I suck with the others ones or am better with one of the same type kinda thing. But yeah considering there's always nerfs and buffs that's probably a fair point!
---
I miss the pins üò≠üò≠
---
To his damage yeah. To his super, that wasn‚Äôt the issue at all. The issue was him being able to approach without skill and 3 shot any gem carrier, nearly instantly, then run away, and if he has star power that becomes less of a chance and more of a guarantee. This isn‚Äôt changed by his current super nerf as 80% of the time he can still successfully do this unless you‚Äôre Gem Carrier as Pam. Otherwise you still can‚Äôt reliably 1v1 Leon.
---
Haha... I really hope I have improved since then! 
---
Really cool to see the old gameplay!
---
Watermark? Lol watch out for Instagram reposters
---
I have seen it a couple times and tried it a few. It can be fun, but without constant dps it is hard to consistently do well. The upside I see is that e clears boxes fast, but, at least in my elo better stick to bulls, elprimos and Shelly's
---
Yea sounds cool. I would name it something different besides Club Wars tho. Maybe "High Noon"?  Too keep to the theme.

You should be using all your brawlers. Maining one doesn‚Äôt work in brawl stars

I have had these days before. I would say it‚Äôs probably a bad day with a mixture of every component you mentioned. Give it a rest, and when a good map comes, start playing her again.

---
Barleys star power might seem underwhelming but it‚Äôs actually one of the better star powers in the game. U don‚Äôt notice it, but in a 1v1 fight, it‚Äôs like a 600-800 hp buff to him (it‚Äôs actually 200 hp per Ross not 100). Also in a fight against crow, it‚Äôs really noticeable bc it allows him to heal while being poisoned.
---
Was I the only one that used the joystick and drag to aim?

Meh I only played 16 games, lost like 4 so 61 trophies. I'll try to push him to Rank 10 maybe even 15 tommorow

It isnt necessary this is an account that I created especifically for seeing what happens with accounts which cannot have shelly skin

---
Who is Rico 
---
It's not bad matchmaking it's just one guy that gemmed his account
---
Only one person said he was bad....
---
He‚Äôs good in brawl ball but you need to learn how to play him. He‚Äôs a highly situational brawler so don‚Äôt go in for kills on say a Bull or another brawler like that.
---
Too weak. Needs a bit faster fire rate or longer super range.

But u just need common sense and understanding that u need to score and not to kill for the most part

Nope. Actually, a large majority of the players used that method.

Yea that‚Äôs what I thought. Weird imo to see people now praising tap to move.
---
The seasons are 2 weeks long
---
Both showdowns have teams to be fair
---
Wasn't replying to their comment. Was replying to yours where you said she's the only one. She's not. Bo has a land mine super.
---
In January, definitely. They said they would speed up releasing new content after the global release. Several new brawlers have already been datamined from the game files, too. 
---
didnt watch but is it spam auto aim?
---
Not talking about gender.. piper is not the only one that has a super like a landmine she's the only "female that has a super like a landmine, is what you should have wrote
---
I've tried to get all my brawlers to to a minimum amount of trophies so I set it at 220. It works pretty well as you will know that the brawlers trophies are all quite close together. For me my highest is primo at 364 trophies and Mortis is my lowest at 224 trophies. Not very balanced but when you get all to your goal, set a higher goal for all your brawlers to reach
---
i meant like shop deals.  maybe like, massively discounted gems (there were no gem deals)... that seems to be the most common thing amongst all other games, the premium currency at a discount
---
well we need to wait till the shop refreshes for offers. i have 22$ to spend on the shop offers. also i contacted supercell and they sad they had some surprise.
---
Yeah, the non-legendaries. At least it was like this during beta. Could‚Äôve changed though, the offers seem to be pretty rare now
---
And I still have none lol
---
Interesting idea
---
Looks like some dude from Assassin Creed
---
It's annoying and I wish supercell would add a report button.
---
Give up, it won't happen. It is a part of the gamemode

They give those skins for free if you create your account before 2019 not if you play at 12

Round on the plaws to u
---
Lv7 bo with almost 500 tropheys
---
Yea i was really disappointed when i wasted the gems on that skin 
---
Why tho
---
It sucks to suck when u suck but nobody else sucks but then sucking is the only thing you can do but sucking sucks 
---
Congrats!
---
Okay? Lol let‚Äôs just stop have a good day bro 
---
Frank to 500+ easy cause he takes no skill 
---
Best game mode is brawl ball due to him getting team kills easily and having high health.
---
Ok hagd
---
Ummm, da fuq.? 
---
he‚Äôs really good at setting his team up for kills by using your super in the bush and stun muiltple targets without enemies see your cast time. really good at gem grab and certain showdown maps 
---
No that would be stupid 
---
Is that the top Leon in the world?
---
He used to be one of the best since his shots bounce but then supercell made the maps 4 tiles wider which makes him and his star power nearly unplayable, but still he is better than some other brawlers
---
The invisible super button moves quickly around the screen and speeds up when its ready.
---
Thats so wrong...u don‚Äôt do that 
---
Yes he is :D
---
Emotes would still be nice. I expect every player has a need to express their emotions in a match. Like, 'GG, so clutch, lol yall noobs'
---
It's just for fun, so maybe at the match end screen only?
---
Perfectly balanced
---
Also 3rd barley and 6th bull
---
I really hope that was a pun.
---

Back in the day what 2500 health was considered 'too much'
---
yep ‚ò∫Ô∏è

Chad
---
Tbh they need to make a updated render of the of Brock that's an instant buy for me
---
But the art on the buttons are based on pins
---
True quality.
---
Gifs you can hear.
---
This is our el primo skin
---
Note I died 2 seconds after because when I tried to tap away from the photo I accidentally taped the photo and it took my to my gallery and that's how I lost 7 stars
---
He now became Brock Obama
---
Make the map a bit larger and have clan battles be a 5v5 Brawl Ball match.
---
Don‚Äôt stay a virgin
---
Indeed
---
3.  Just a little bit of water is nice
---
At level two?!
---
Be happy that u are at 1 LOL. I'm not even there
---
Still better than me right? Soo that's why you are one ;)
---
Did you not see my comment above, I was playing Gem grab earlier as Leon, and he was the last brawler I played, so I still have him selected yet.
---
:)

What are you talking about!!!
---
The new brock looks so much better
---
So you are saying that its fine to have a 10k player play a 1k player? What about during random matches when you have 3 1k players playing a team of 7k players?
---
Players at 1k are already matched with other 1k players with one high brawler, the problem is me at 10k having to carry 2 bots against an organised team. It was already bad to play with randoms but now it has become unplayable. (also saying 'just play with a team doesn't work all the time and I don't want to join a team for 2 matches and leave)
---
Is this video sped up???
---
The King of the hill gamemode concept has been around longer than tf2
---
Yo I just started yesterday, had a 30ish win streak with Shelly lmfao. I tried almost none. I think that dude with the pink hair is a skill shot champion and hard as fffffff to learn, but OP if you get him down
---
Dude I was in his band for a while. 1 week ago he was at 6k and now he's almost 10k
---
Thank us**
---
Yeah Colt
---
The trophy gap is over 500 dude
---
No i dont want a friend request everytime i win or get starplayer
---
Why is your legendary chance so high
---
Watermark 10/10
---
You sir is a very toxic player. Hope you never win
---
Nah he uses aim-bot.
---
I love this so much
---
üòéüòéüôèüôè
---
Selfish bastard
---
You should‚Äôve just drawn a bush
---
Ikr
---
And he one shots everyone with infinite range and his super gives an automatic win
---
With shelly tho, i dont auto aim, i hold down the button to see the AOE. She is my favorite champ so far, that bear chick is preettty fun too. Also like mariachi man, very OP. That wrestler is good but he requires a lot of team cooperation i think, cause i feed with him
---
Great wifi, but with good speed? And on cellular network, there will always be slight delay. 
---
Everyone here waiting for shop to reset like: cmon do something
---
You must be low cups.
---
People have been playing colt since long ago. He's good but not too strong.
---
Oh ok
---
I'm still mad about the fact that Brock has 4 missiles in his launcher but can only fire 3 shots.
---
Not really that low lmao, I just see many players think he is under powered and notice that Colts DOMINATE if they can move and aim at the same time.
---
No offence to the clash royale artist but their stuff looks so bad compaired to brawl stars art
---
U can‚Äôt 
---
Oh god no, I don‚Äôt want to be spammed with more requests
---
Thanks for the feedback!
---
Yeah noobs obviously don't know how to colt. That's a given. I mean what do you expect when a noob plays a fairly high skill cap character?
---
Make it a huge afro
---
When your mom says stop playing brawl stars
---
20 DL
---
3 UL
---
it is usally like 26/4-5
---
But regardless its unplayable on any wifi connection i use. ios btw
---
K
---
Exactly, it‚Äôs a team game mode not a individual one, the team who plays best together will take the win... not the best individual.
---
Im reposting this, as i am the original person who made this post before. That makes me the one who posted the OC
---
i think he looks fine? it‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs the biggest deal, either. a minor change to a specific skin is one thing while changing the entire thing is kind of unrealistic haha
---
Clever
---
Heh) I tried to do better) Can show each character separately)
---
Anything above 500 will match people with 460 or higher usually
---
ROFL
---
He was #1 bar. He passed me and coup
---
I am the original creator 
---
r/woooosh get wooooshed
---
I still got 14 minutes 
---
It‚Äôs true I was the barrel
---
I don‚Äôt get why you‚Äôre still arguing? My argument is that we‚Äôre on the same page, my argument was that he is a high skill cap/floor character and is actually strong when good, contrary to what a lot of the community thinks.
---
Thank you) I will do more, and maybe I will show all the characters separately)
---
They‚Äôre prolly not that good. I‚Äôve never heard of any of them
---
What?
---
It‚Äôs based off a character in CR
---
Damn, don't team dude
---
not trying to trigger anyone

Sometimes I like to talk lol. But yeah, the post is a bit misleading but I agree with you.

MEME REVIEW

Lmao 
---
Why do you keep claiming this was today then?
---
I'm not an asshole) I'm doing a favorite thing and I will continue) Thanks for the feedback)
---
Supercell is not going to give you a star power in shop because you ask them on redit... Pliz think before posting
---
Just you. Yes he's annoying, but if you're close with a high dmg brawler (even crow while he doesn't even have high damage), Poco stands no chance 
---
It's normal for a support to stay alive longer don't you think? 
---
before the nerfs, yes, nowadays, he's in.a good place, good reaction, awareness ia needed to utilize him to full potential and his supers needs timing as opposed to the other characters that hold a similar role to his
---
Couldn‚Äôt care less.
---
You got a Shelly skin and a box for Christmas.
---
Yes of course I want more gifts but hey 
---
That would be primero. As in first. 
---
Great art, man!
---
Honestly? Those graphics look better than the current ones.
---
Imao*
---
I got 2 tickets
---
5 Leon power points here, I‚Äôm also unhappy lol
---
Cut off happened as soon as it turned midnight basically 
---
the splash damage make him strong you need to make his splash useless
---
What about..... Jessie
---
Too tall
---
Kind of looks like that hunter from Tarzan
---
No, I‚ÄôM IN CHARGE!
---
uh ok....weird opinion
---
Nothing special in my shop :/
---
Mate I get the same thing,  I am only in the 250 trophy range with my brawlers but I get put against people with star power, it‚Äôs crazy frustrating.
---
Yes it‚Äôs totally random, I got lucky buying the level packs.
---
Damn
---
remember those days lol
---
I would say the opposite. Deals are the best way to help us non whales progress with some speed.
---
Colt is strong! Just most of the Colt players suck...
---
r/uselessredcircle 
---
How much trophy's do you have?
---
The boomerang idea was from another post i think
---
Yeah I got 12 coins as well......SC well generous!
---
Leon 666 i guess...
---
omg hahaha this is beyond bad.. that Leon must've one shoted everyone in your team
---
549/550 but still green
---
Rip, at that point your only hope would be to get them low enough that they start turning on each other, which could only be done by tara and penny really
---
Wait....... why isn‚Äôt Leon teaming with Mortis to anti those throwers?
---
Yaharrrr
---
and how many epics/mythics do you have 
---
thanks man
---
No need if you check bushes you‚Äôre fine 
---
Big facts dude.
---
I cant make up my mind too but it ends today
---
But if your at 7k and get a new brawler, you would get matched with other players with maxed brawlers against your level one, and maybe you don't even know how to play that new brawler yet.
---
Ok now that‚Äôs epic
---
Im at 7k. I still don't have mythics or legendaries...
---
Currently about 2.42k still grinding though. Only had the chance to play since global launch
---
That map is horrible! You can't stay away from the  bushes!
---
Stop stalking me torque üòÇ 
---
I got 18 gold and 21 power points for Leon. Happy new year üéä 
---
he does!
---
Exactly but people its stupid af xd
---
Not bad I‚Äôm at 8372
---
Oh shit now is 80 gems:)))) Bought him before revamp for 30 gems:))) Thank u supercell for letting us to keep it(They could just give us 30 gems and take the skin, to make us pay more) 
---
üëèüèª
---
Delete the game
---
He doesnt need any nerf. 
---
Reverse the meme and its correct
---
Play Cavern Churn slolos and shoot totally random.....You will get 2nd or 3rd place 85% of the time
---
Oh no sorry I‚Äôm not flexing ‚ò∫Ô∏è. I honestly didn‚Äôt mean to do it like that. I‚Äôve covered stuff up on posts in the past and no one liked it. So I didn‚Äôt do it now.
---
Too late for me now

I got killed by two of them so meh

How about the super button for leon?

Im glad that you like it!

Where can you find that?

Or when 2s left one or two teammates are dead and he suicides instead of just draw.

Looks cool would be awesome if it was a smaller version of himself as a nutcracker to throw and it explodes into crushed nuts 
---
With tanks you can auto aim at point blank range.
---
have my upvote
---
leon flex?
---
Did you mean...? LEON?
---
so does basicly everythin go away if you choose ranked?
---
Nobody asked for your opinion 
---
Actually this is in ur favor, since penny deals tons of splash when they group up
---
Reject him
---
After getting rejected by many women he had enough and became Bull
---
brock can be used in both short and long range, while piper can only be used long range
---
Then do it correctly, every one is free to do what they want

Hi

Maybe in 3 years' time, I might be able to get my brawler to level 9. Oh boy I just can't wait!

I beat sobhan once with randoms

Nice hairstyle

Nah, buying tickets from the shop on weekends 60 tickets per 80 gems or waiting for good special offers (do the math to determine which is most efficient for special offers cuz they can vary in value)
---
I have all at 1600 and 1 mythical 
---
Leon counters shelly and primo if they have 0% super charged
---
This comment made me laugh really hard xD

Truth

He should have the signature blue jacket :O

My mans needs a buff :(

Was just about to tell that joke m8.....but I though it was Bullcrap

I have 3.5k Trophies but I also have another account with 1.8k Trophies &amp; I play with other high trophy players all the time. Could I join?

And then try get close to you...

Well thats amazing.. Good job

&amp;#x200B;
---
*This time with 5 brawlers left and the watermark* automatic points *ding* *ding* *ding*
---
so it rly depends on skills (and luck) of that situation. I only think in most case Barley will be winning, or at least dying together
---
Thats hot
---
Should be able to do it by tapping on the persons name
---
Personally I enjoy using Frank. Once I figured out how to use him effectively, he became my first rank 20 brawler
---
how do you make these?
---
I know the feeling I woke up early to check, proper miffed that there was nothing.
---
Dont play with randoms on gem grab
---
You are just moaning go play outside kid...
---
Bet anything he was praying to RNGesus lmao 
---
You forgot the ‚Äústolen from brawl stars‚Äù watermark 
---
Fr u need to check the bush.
---
Ya, and ppl thought it only worked with Jessie
---
It depends. I personally try not to auto aim at all because sometimes it might hit the wrong brawler if they are both near you. I usually only use it for oh sh*t moments.
---
You're in my boat kinda, got em on my second ever big box after spending $25 trying to level poco, my friends didn't believe me now rip my rng forever
---
Bull is not OP, he is just overplayed and overrated. Also bush campers make him look strong.
---
They are already sleeping...why? ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)

What is that
---
&gt;Can I pet Crow?

I suggest not to, as hes old description says...

wow you reposted a old post good job karma stealer
---
What about direction? It‚Äôs just gonna get confusing.

Alone, but what strikes me as odd is I used to get matched with equal levelled guys
---
Bull love this map

Bruh that‚Äôs terri-Bull jk

 * The easiest brawler.

* Can only deal 1 damage.

Repost

I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth it. Even with manual aim you will almost always miss one of punches. His reload is quick so auto-aim spam can make up fir the misses.
---
No u
---
No you both

How common are the champion purchases? I can buy a mythic brawler but it costs like $19.99. I wasn‚Äôt planning on investing a lot of money since I just started playing and have a few champs that a like from boxes along the way. I don‚Äôt have any mythic or epic brawlers. Am I missing out here as in I‚Äôll never get this opportunity again or is this just a plain rip off? New to Supercell games so any advice would be appreciated.
---
r/lootstars
---
YEET!
---
cool idea
---
Thanks!
---
The limit only prevents progression for people who let it hit the cap, anyone else it has no effect at all. The only change would be that instead of having to play daily you could maybe play longer periods that are more spread apart. The problem is that games these days want people logging in daily and consistently, not spread out for longer chunks of playing.
---
He‚Äôs just saying that the Dynamike already has level 10 at just 20 trophies.
---
it's idea? or spoiler?

It‚Äôs not like you‚Äôre thinking üòÇ

Tickets if you can get times that give rewards better than what a token doubler would give and otherwise the token doubler.

At close range it can be fine, but you just shouldn't be getting close.
---
Play in showdown best way to grind up tropies very quickly and best map.are double trouble,thousand lake and scorched stone .
---
Brawl stars was better in portrait
---
wut movie is dat?

Wow...

Buts its just a small amount, 120 or 140 tokens to open Boxes

Great, thanks. How many ticks does one hit produce?

I was actually wondering that when I made the post, I guess it didn't recognize it this time.
---
It‚Äôs open Beta now so everyone can try :) Go to mordeus.itch.io/brawlcraft and try it out! Let me know what you think :)
---
this is amazing
---
Digimon is copied from Pok√©mon (cacnea)
---
It's against the rules of this subreddit to give you any information about it, but I think it's forbidden and that it would be really hard to play anyways
---
Perfectly balanced. As all things should be. 
---
That‚Äôs a bit of an exaggeration, isn‚Äôt it?
---
You just need to practice and learn how to play with brawlers better then
---
There is really no way...
---
He can win a Bull or Primo since he outranges them tho.
---
Glad to see that someone else enjoys him too, instead of complaining!
---
Double the amount of patches and cut the size in half or more. Make it risky to stay in a patch but give more options to find one.
---
Don't worry, I plugged it in after I posted this. :)
---
I was meh on the primo one but idk, Tara is just dominant for too long, and Mortis is way to high skilled and I just want to change the role from primary ball carrier to agro, by buffing his dps, and I felt like Bull is just too dominant in heist, that was my thought process
---
Yeah. That s why if he click the guy's profile and see his trophies range and other brawlers lvl. Might be a different matter.
---
I once saw a lvl 10 dynamite around 60 trophies lvl 10 and his profile is one brawler around 350 and couple at 100 and rest around 10. All lvl 10.
---
wellll then  you cant do much ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Lol look at the one who was getting on to someone over a single post 
---
Hello there! I understand you are having questions about In-app purchases!
---
The team has actually made a statement about this.
---
Any XP level pack offer you haven't purchased, it will show up in shop at some point! We try to keep our offers fresh and interesting for our players, so soon enough they will be there and you will be able to buy the one that fits you best.
---
Just keep in mind to check the shop form time to time!
---
I hope this helped answer your question! Happy Brawling! ü§†
---
How do you know?
---
I think people underestimate him and get too close. That's a huge mistake :).
---
Leon should have his range reduced. For an assassin, he has surprisingly long range
---
Alright thanks!
---
four ticks
---
Nice
---
thousand pipers
---
But it's been 3 weeks? Why did you change from 2 every week to almost 0 legendary Offers? What happened? 
---
While I‚Äôm over here, opening up over 300 boxes and still doesn‚Äôt get it
---
tickets and grind  robo rumble 
---
How would they even fix that
---
 This image reminds me of everytime a bull charges out a bush and kills me in showdown... 
---
If you have brawler that have 500 throphies every throphies higher are getting halfed for exaple
---
you have 600 throphies shelly after end of the season you will have 550 etc.
---
It only happens for brawlers that have more then 500
---
I‚Äôm all for like a damage buff for Mortis, but if
---
you buff his reload speed or dash range he will just become super strong on bb
---
Ty 
---
got mortis from a normal one and boy do i suck with him
---
thanks a lot 
---
Bouth are useless
---
I guess, but to portray a river I feel like I'd need it to go off the screen, which would ruin my view of how I wanted the river to split the map in half.  
---
Don't main, try to find Friends to play gem grab and bounty and also of you don't have Friends, try to play showdown.
---
Glad to help!
---
Thanks :D
---
Beach Shelly ???!
---
Thanks! Do you mind if I use some at http://mobilegamerhub.com/brawl-stars ? I‚Äôm also doing some custom icons 
---
Yeah I miss chips.... I liked bolts the most out of all the upgrade systems tho
---
I was thinking about this idea but I'm lazy to make it üôÉ
---
Yeah it's showdown sized.

Eu tenho o crow a um tempo e quando vi que o nome dele ficou "corvo" eu voltei pro ingl√™s...

ok you could‚Äôve at least put the water mark somewhere besides smack in the middle right

Good bot
---
Why hate a player for using the features of the game to their advantage? Supercell made autoaim so characters that are close range use it. Hate the player for abusing bugs or any other type of cheating. Hate the game if you think a feature is bad.

Barley's pretty strong in like half the arena modes. I've found it easier to win with him than anyone else, surprisingly.
---
It's impossible to tell whats honest stupidity and whats stupidity as a joke. Especially if you work retail.

I agree, this does not seem possible.

Thank you so much... really...
---
I think it's a bit op to have a bat that can show you in wich direction is the enemy, but I like the idea to see more in the distance than other brawlers, that will make him special like Darryl (his super chargen autmatly in 20 sec)

And 2630 trophies

Agreed. A few of the memes are fine but after it ultimately gets old and is no longer funny. People still make memes about leons invisibility which i think is pretty dumb as they have been made since the update several weeks ago. The other ones are just useless posts saying ‚ÄúNeRf BuLl RRREEEEEEE.‚Äù I‚Äôm fine with fanart as long as it is quality and not a shitty 5m drawing. Also the endless posts about pulling brawlers and stuff should probably be deleted.
---
No, but they are simple to make, and somone made them bonus
---
We are in the same trophy range, I am missing Tara and the legendaries....
---
It makes sence, one teammate is Alive (top Skull)  the one in the middle is a dead teammate of yours, and the bottom one is an enemy. It makes sence

Im totally on your side. I have 1100 Trophies, which isn't much at all, but I only have 8 Gems without having spent a single one if them
---
That viking bull is brain dead.
---
I do that
---
They kinda look like siblings 
---
Stop 
---
How about visible bush movement?
---
Just make some skins available through the trophy road rewards. Honestly I don‚Äôt have the incentive to grind hundreds of trophies just to get 50 coins or 25 power points. Especially after unlocking Bo.

If you play all the time you should have a lot of trophies

Holy fuck I hope that isn't true
---
Ok but i dont see what a picture of your desk has to do with leon
---
Great idea, the few they have included in trophy awards are too sporadic 
---
Love the idea, upvote
---
He must have played since beta
---
9/10 no bush
---
This is some Ifunny garbage
---
NO PLEASE STOP!
---
The game is probably one of the least p2w games when looking at games that include a leveling system. The difference leveling up makes is actually pretty small. A level 10 brawler is only 45% stronger than s level 1 brawler. The biggest single powerup a brawler can get is his star power. But that is only really true for some brawlers since some star powers aren‚Äòt even that good or in case of Dynamike‚Äòs just have really high skill cap. 
---
The season before last season the highest player in the world was actually a f2p player (Relyhh) who has mostly level 7 brawlers and only one star power (Bo‚Äòs - who is nearly unplayable in top ladder without). 
---
So even though the game might seem p2w in the beginning it is a lot more skill based. 
---
Btw: It takes only about 1.5 years to completly max your account f2p with the biggest hurdle being to get the legendary brawlers and all the star powers (can also be bought for gold in the shop)
---
I think it will be more beneficial for you to find a job and earn money to purchase skins so SC doesn't have an excuse to nerf progression later on.
---
okay but thats exactly what I said lmao
---
Not my idea. It is mentioned in the post itself.
---
Watermark op:)))) 
---
I agree 
---
Eat my butt
---
Checl bushes
---
Hell yeah
---
This is a cool idea I like it. I think mortis just needs a slightly faster reload speed and that will make him a little bit more powerful when you're at close range at least and allowing players who arent as good with him to be able to defend themselves from full health players better.
---
Aggressive staying at one place
---
Agreed.
---
Please remove this post, Frank is a really good brawler. You must have meant Mortis or Rico.

Wauw! This is very nicely made, and super cute too. I wanna see more. :D

Aaa tysm

SUAHSUAHSUHAUSHAUHSUAHSUAUSH

i have 12 and 1.2k trophies

Mortis is OP... Rico is terrible too

I think that if you have a dinamike at lvl 10 you can camp at the center

Sad

Donghoon already fell for it

Weird flex but ok

Less stupid people in matchmaking.. I‚Äôve been playing hours and made no progress even with 2 upgrades!!

holy sh... this is really good!!

Lol I played yesterday and didn‚Äôt know it was the last time to get her

**FLAPJACK WHERE U AT???**

thank you so much, i really needed this

This was TARAbull...

Oof thanks aa

I know, if I was a new player I wouldn‚Äôt even post here for any kind of help because 95% of it is memes and I would think nobody would answer me lol

Hahahahahahaha This IS my main lmao

Odd context for that joke.
---
Dead maymay since 2011 and used format wrong. 2/10 better luck next time
---
The subreddit was actually pretty good before global, but now it feels like all the fortnite 7-year olds moved to this sub
---
This is cool 
---
Kawaii
---
Thank u
---
&gt; the game is pretty pay to win
---
Not really.
---
Its called saracasm I D I O T
---
Better then mine, i had to delete mine ;-;
---
Go away, I‚Äôm tired
---
Darryl is great with his star power. Amazing in gem grab and bounty. But without it, it‚Äôs not very useful at all. Just like how Magikarp is useless until it becomes a Gyarados, so the symbol to compare the two should become an equal sign. (=)
---
I see what you mean. I could easily purchase a skin but I‚Äôm just looking at skin accessibility compared to other games that make it easier. 
---
He is good if you can play him right. He is already very strong in brawl ball and one of the best at surviving in showdown. Stop asking for buffs for high-skill cap brawlers.
---
And the have seen 5 exactly the same as this
---
Love the detail. Especially that you can see a little of the nose ring.
---
The worst legendary but he‚Äôs good in general
---
sPiKe is A bOy ThO!
---
BEAUTIFUL

Thank u ;)

Can you link it?

Thanks and I ship them for no reason xd

It‚Äôs not themed as Wild West for over a year now
---
I love this‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüòçüòç
---
I‚Äôm 100% sure Leon is a guy
---
No dances, too much associated with Fortnite...but I think other emotes would be fine to add to the game
---
So? Every brawler is equally viable to play and get wins with. Levels don't matter if you're skilled. People got every brawler to 500 at power 1. You're just salty you don't have all the legendaries (which aren't even better than commons).
---
Thanks! 
---
No this is an awful idea we don‚Äôt need more 8 year olds asking ‚Äúis this fortnite?‚Äù
---
No nudes
---
I said that I hold gems and avoid fight usually haha.
---
That means I take gems and I am a gem keeper Mortis,
---
Sure, l take gems. Mortis moves fast with its normal attack.
---
He‚Äôs good to be a gem keeper he can evade enemies‚Äô attack more easily.
---
nice meme, dude
---
Shouldn't barley also be up there in Cavern Churn? He's pretty good at area control, however he can't get #1 consistently. My friend got him up from 400 --&gt; 500 using Cavern Churn
---
Haha keep going you will kill them all at some point xD
---
Just flex on them all of them have level 5 shelly
---
Don‚Äôt play the mode then
---
Gold.
---
High skill
---
I actually like this. Its semi-dead
---
Those are definitely some good vibes right there tbh. Synergy is so important! I‚Äôve done the same in duos and bounty/heists, I understand you can‚Äôt win all your games, that‚Äôs not how getting better works and that‚Äôs especially not how to do well in a game, but if you know you and your team was trying, it‚Äôs not something to give up on. 
---
Aaaa tysm
---
They have said they are keeping the games separate so entirely unique characters from their other games
---
If it has ‚Äúhuman verification‚Äù I just click off. I know that nothing is free but they really need to try harder to download their promoted apps
---
This is such a creative idea nobody have ever came up with. Guess this is the buff mortis needs and he'll be balanced:D
---
Better Buulllieve it
---
What does this have to do with what I said?
---
That‚Äôs just because the matchmaking is messed up
---
[Something the fake lex said. ](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/492220060564193280/529766920266711050/image0.jpg) 
---
Chips. Everytime I heard that I thought of poker.
---
Oh... Well then I'm just gonna leave this here as a concept cause I worked hard on it
---
Your salty over it right? Just don‚Äôt play it geez
---
Just no
---
That's almost a sentence
---
Are you retarded? I am not the person who made this post.
---
We axru need a few maps like this.  Plenty of cover but minimal grass.  Supercell seems to love filling in maps with tons of grass leading to the Bull, Primo, Shelly epidemic.
---
No only normal tokens 
---
Yeah it‚Äôs still a good idea and looks nice so take the upvote. Maybe they can make a new brawler based on a similar concept just not a hog rider
---
Oop
---
Guess I am
---
Omg a 25% dAmAgE buff? You‚Äôre high as hell. Terrible idea... he‚Äôs already a nightmare 
---
They make a great couple! Definitely shipping them now XD
---
I usually just concede boxes early if necessary, whittle people down from range while they're at it with each other, use super to make space/finish people off, and from there I'm usually top 4.
---
Then I just stay safe and keep walls between myself and others while throwing as much as I can to charge my super. I've won with 9 boxes and I've won with 1 box.
---
For me kairos is probly the best youtuber for brawl stars and i didnt enjoy chiken at all
---
Whos gonna tell him
---
this is the worst meme i've ever seen in this subreddit smh
---
Xd
---
People thinking Darryl is a shotgun brawler and not an assassin is giving me a lot of giggles lately
---
According to ingame skill descriptions, Leon uses male pronouns.
---
Why do people say "I'd very much like to ask..." when you are talking directly with that person already? Just curious.
---
Everyone has their preferences. I just think chiken deserves more recognition for the work he puts in.
---
You should try your best to really push everything as evenly as possible. The more total trophies you have, the faster your progression(more brawl boxes, coins, power points, levels, new brawlers). I‚Äôm not saying don‚Äôt push those brawlers you really like, but you still should play the brawlers you don‚Äôt like as much. It‚Äôs ok if they are Low rank, as Long as you get a feel for their mechanics, you‚Äôll get to play the brawler well in the future.
---
that seems about right 
---
Thanks satan! 
---
I disagree. Way too easy to exploit
---
Why not? Arcade games were ported to consoles back in the 80/90s  and there are already ported mobile games for the switch such as Arena of Valor.
---
Brawl Stars for the switch  makes more sense than Arena of Valor IMO
---
Are you retarded?No doubt.
---
Phones are supposed to be off in the theaters ü§î
---
More balanced than power 4s with power 10
---
No it wont come out on switch, i would love for it to be on switch but, the switch is almost only Nintendo games, i don‚Äôt thing Supercell would do that
---
They should make a new box which you can only get skins out of
---
I only have 2 more, it‚Äôs not a lot. Supercell insist not giving me Mortis or Leon, I‚Äôm sad.
---
Why is the bottom so much further than the top to the gem spawner
---
It is a cool concept but if the bat shows the direction might be really OP. I feel that if it only shows when there is an enemy close it is suficient.
---
There was a situation after the Leon nerf when you could use invisibility eye to something similar to that. But is patched.
---
Great idea! 
---
The point is that it doesn‚Äôt run out. If you don‚Äôt play the game, your doubler is still there.
---
You stole my comment
---
This would be kinda op but would be nice to have Mortis buffed
---
This mad me laugh so hard!!! Lol i love Bart simpson!!! No homo
---
Also i think emotes should be a thing
---
Oh yes, i'm going to correct it
---
Dude they don't care. Stop posting this every day
---
Hard....
---
Push all brawler.
---
In Clash Royale, it can take up to 10 years to max an account and get every card without playing. On Brawl Stars, it takes at MAX a year and a half. It's pretty easy up until legendaries.
---
I guess you have to think again
---
Congrats man!!!!
---
This happens when I am charging my phone and it tops out at 100 or charger blinks on off for a split second. 
---
Skins... Well, for me at least
---
It would be nice to have a whole bunch of skins to chose from 
---
Thanks for all the answers I‚Äôll be sure to be updating on my progress
---
I know i auto aimed a bit, but that was because when a enemy is moving in a straight direction towards or away from me, i use the quick fire
---
Ahhh I remember OWNato, what happend to him?
---
that happens?  i gotta admit i have teamed in solo (not for cheating trophies i actually dropped quite a few) but in duos?!
---
( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞) 
---
¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø 
---
so 0?
---
No one should use auto aim unless the person is right next to you and running at you. If you autoaim you will miss a lot.
---
I don't like it. It could ruin the game mode. Imagine if it is in the walls right next to the safe
---
Stay as far from enemies as possible, don't auto aim much, and only play her in bounty. I think you've got her down.
---
I have been playing since summer and have all brawlers besides from Spike and Leon. It takes quite a long time to get every brawler because as soon as you unlock one, your chances of finding another brawler from BB drop significantly.
---
For sure. We are ramping up our discussions but right now we are all a bit busy. The influx of global traffic and the holidays have made things a bit harder, but we don't plan to stop discussion posts any time soon. 
---
Thanks man! Please upvote post to, i need more people to see this, and no I‚Äôm not desperate
