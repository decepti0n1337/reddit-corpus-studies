i had him rank 11 at level 2
---
---
---
He notado que las probabilidades de que salga un brawler han disminuido, porq antes facilmente me salieron spike y crow pero ahora he abierto mas de 500 cajas y no me sale leon, estadisticamente ya deber√≠an de haberme salido 5 leones... Pero ahora lo veo mas complicado, podrian mejorar eso?
---
The day is upon us
---
I used to be a big fan of gem grab cuz I can count on people but the more trophies I got the less trust I had

Yes it's not enough to max them out.  You also have to be able to play them. It's a problem I struggle with on several brawlers.
---
No lol, I played lol 1 or 2 times at my friend's house, that's it.
---
Hardik is a common indian name lol
---
what
---
Bringing nothing new to the argument and just repeating yourself is what I would define as a shitpost. I at least showed that other people share the same opinion. 
---
Nice!
---
Oh no. How did you know that
---
CJ? OOOHHHHHHHHHHHHH WASSUP MY DOG! 
---
lmao, so true
---
I would definitely buy for more than stupid since I could give in tickets, please supercell add in the game she is the best so far
---
It would be interesting to have a brawler that can modify the map

For sure!!

Best fanart I‚Äôve seen tbh
---
Is this a thing for kids nowadays? I'm so glad I graduated 10 years ago. 
---
Everybody else like: lol Gene's mumbling nonsense again, how cute.
---
I saw one of these like a whole year ago
---
I feel like I have to draw Thanos Primo now
---
Approxemately how many new brawlers will we Have this year 2019??? 
---
I'm sold
---
Oh sorry üòê 
---
At least it was a tie and you didn‚Äôt end up losing
---
I guess that the box automatically opened. Maybe observe any changes in ur brawler power points? The same thing has happened to me before
---
I maxed Colt a long time ago. Decided to play siege with him. He is now rank 20 and 420 trophies. I want to die. I‚Äôve dropped him into the 300s before
---
Yeah that would be nice lmao
---
Can relate, except for the star power 
---
My only qualm is that el primo looks tiny af.
---
Not really, there are lots of teamers and you get attacks from everywhere so or i have bad luck or Im just bad
---
Last update he can reach through walls but his super deals no damage.  Although I think if he drags your butt through a wall you should take some damage.  I mean you just got pulled through an unmoveable obstacle.  
---
Yes I did. üòÖ Thus I was getting frustrated by the conversation going nowhere lol. No u, style.
---
Tell me, is what you said in the text true or did you unlock Pam from brawl box and say she just randomly got unlocked and entered your account?
---
Don't team with lieon
---
Lots of detail
---
Waste of a post not impressive 
---
Get it? Because there will always be 10 bulls in this map?
---
Realist
---
Matchmaking sucks... im a lvl 6 still under 3k and I get matched with lvl 10s, my solo showdowns are mostly shelly players, a few bulls and if im lucky one or two colts. 
---
I played siege earlier, other team dominated us im three matches, like overwhelmly, I was often by myself surviving against 3 of the enemy team, incredibly difficult. Felt like the mode was 3 vs 1, had to play 4 matches for my token
---
Brawl ball - often get no close range but whole team has strong close range and we get wrecked. Makes no sense
---
The real question is how is the cannon of the mortar able to fit in the treasure chest?
---
Overconfidence...
---
... is a slow and insidious killer
---
How is his work this good
---
Cool skin
---
But... But... I came up with Thanos Primo!
---
Yeah I agree I think they need to add competitive game modes and should definitely remove Auto aim. I think they should add a kill counter to showdown and add tournaments like in clash Royale but make them acaully goodüòÇ
---
The turns have tabled 
---
Pocos weapon is a guitar so he‚Äôs just tryna let us feel the power of music
---
It's for if you missed it lol
---
crow ain't bad but imo u succ
---
Poco gang
---
Well he is a creature of the night
---
How the turntables
---
Oh I didn‚Äôt know that existed thanks for letting me know
---
YES
---
Don‚Äôt take your trophies so seriously man; if you‚Äôre good you‚Äôre good. If you‚Äôre not then you will get better don‚Äôt even worry about. 
---
This Fits Her!!!
---
WAIT THOSE THINGS ARE CALLED POWER CUBES???¬ø¬ø¬ø
---
Me and my friends just called them gem boxes like clash of clansüòÇ
---
Crow is not good again most brawlers, it's weak
---
Hire them please
---
by the end of this month i believe
---
Have mouth too
---
Carl isn‚Äôt a robot
---
Ikr. Leon does need any more nerfs
---
I feel like Gene is the witch because of his shooting and Jessie could have like a shaman thing. Idk. Luv ur work
---
Yup! Even Pineapple Spike would be great to design someday.
---
Good points, I agree with them all. I agree it is good the devs are adding new features. I think they added the spring trap mainly to add more action and increase the potential to organize an attack. However, as you described, some randoms only see the i in organize.
---
Why you have Carly when my whole country still don't have
---
Very good simple art! Imo I prefer more detailed drawings but still very nice!
---
Exactly. Glad I'm not the only one
---
THIS MAP IS ACTUSLLY A MASTERPEICE
---
What is the character that cost them the most to design?
---
J O B
---
It looks like she just went Super Saiyan Blue :)
---
Couple of things, 1. Skin idea for primo: gaint skin from clash of clans and royale. 2. Will there be a custom map mode for people to make their own showdowns or other modes. 3. New gamemode: deathmatch, teams of 5 go agaisnt the other team, each player will have 1 life, the team have to get rid of the other team.
---
oof
---
i can relate alot im curretly at 8k from global launch and im tryin to get to that juicy 10k!
---
Remove life leech- yeah
---
remove meteor- It Is A gOoD tEaMiNg SoLuTiOn
---
Op
---
Where's carl
---
Bush arena ,w,
---
Ah. A Tyranid joke. I also collect them.
---
its not funny anymore 
---
Nope still don‚Äôt have him
---
Shut up he‚Äôs the first I‚Äôve seen
---
It‚Äôs his teammate it says back in 13 sec
---
Go to my page and look :3
---
?
---
Idc as long as I have over 400 so I can have replays
---
It doesn‚Äôt effect matchmaking at all üôÑ
---
It only changes the local leaderboard location. I think that this is only in the game because every other Supercell game has it ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Idiot, he‚Äôs talking about the piper with double digit trophies
---
I love the hat
---
Fucking hate her on the current showdown map
---
Hol up
---
That‚Äôs fake... my Crow dropped from 506 to 385 but he is still power rank 20 
---
I have 4.6k trophies and i dont have any of them xd
---
Poor-smart
---
Just u mate
---
I got Crow and Leon when I was at around 2.5k to 3k trophies. These babies (Frank and Tara) at 4K and the rest at 5k to 7k.
---
There are not too many situations where his star power is actually useful. 
---
But in some heist maps it can be very strong.
---
I‚Äôd recommend doing a heap of friendlies (make sure you don‚Äôt play against bots, because you need to get used to jumping with delay) and trying to get accurate with it.
---
Leon:u cant see me
---
Nah it‚Äôs just your language. There was one language that kept ricochet 
---
Because one the other someone else has over 400 trophies
---
Why not? Poco‚Äôs super goes through walls, why shouldn‚Äôt Genie‚Äôs shadowy hand?
---
CrEaTurE √∏F Th‚Ç¨ D‚Ç¨v√Ø¬£
---
Oh is it my language also that shows the bot‚Äôs HP in siege? All the YouTubers I watch don‚Äôt have that...
---
HAHAHHA
---
How do you use it
---
lmao that shelly is so dumb
---
Yeah but it makes sense because Poco uses music so his teammates could hear it over walls 
---
Oh my little friend. Of course. I did. üòÇ
---
In December i bought some mega boxes and my last one i got Tara and Mortis, i felt like the luckiest person in the world.
---
I honestly don‚Äôt know about that one
---
Acutally they confirmed that Krabby Patties are not made of crab meat
---
Crow gang
---
4000+ i had every brawlers except gene and all legendaries :/
---
Same! Got this today and was so confused. Something do do with level 65 I think it restars
---
Hey, sorting by new gave me something cool :)
---
Seems fair to me
---
I guarantee if you look up hard dick (or soft dick stfu) you will not find anything about a person named that. It‚Äôs not a weird obsession if it is common knowledge 
---
If a mortis fought an el primo he would die before he kills him. And with more power cubes, he would die even faster so its not a nerf...
---
This reminds me Sonic The Hedgehog and Super Mario games and Bull looks skinny
---
What do you think this is? Facebook? reported.
---
It was my favourite mode because it stopped teaming in showdown 
---
He just likes Technology calm down wtf
---
Congrats!!
---
center looks like a swastika
---
What
---
Yeah its to team
---
Next time go to r/LootStars
---
Yes this is what is more needed right now. Most of the time it isn't the enemies that gets u frustrated, it's your own teammates. Like u said, people going AFK, spinning in the same place for no good reason, deliberately throwing away the match etc.
---
Forgot to say...I did this map as 2 different "military" bases, so this is why's like that and has these hiding spots! The water is making you not go far away, simular to: "Go there and fight!"
---
YEA WE NEED IT
---
This is what teaming in duo showdown feels like
---
What? Global launch? I started in December and I'm just halfway yours lol! I guess I'm not as good a player as I think I am haha. Congrats!
---
Teaming in SOLO showdown. It's not always dynamike but that's basically the stereotype of teaming. You'll see it at higher trophies.
---
I've been playing F2P since July, and have 3 star powers. I kind of 'focus' on one brawler and buy all their offers in the shop. Most of my brawlers are levels 4-6 with one 7 that I'm levelling right now, and my 3 10s. Should u be levelling everyone equally?
---
2 of my friends got leon and crow before reaching 1k
---
I‚Äôm at 2.3k and have all epics and mythics but no darryl 
---
prob. 20 seconds and it doesn't charge when attacking.
---
or 30 seconds, just like Darryl.
---
OP, did you just create 2 accounts just to comment on your post?
---
What I have learned from Brawl Stars: Never trust a Leon
---
Well yes, But actually no
---
The fun you can have saying the n-word I love it
---
iM aLreadY gEnji
---
Yea, gotta wait every month, legendary‚Äôs cost about 549 gems.
---
Primo could have just jumped to the top.. Why did he risk jumping backwards,  to be shot forwards?  More like a 2 IQ play.  And wow poco you literally walked into a bull... 
---
Looks like makoto shishio  any kenshin fans??:)
---
Yeah I bought Leon and Spike (last Saturday) I‚Äôm looking forward to have Crow but I can wait anyway :)

She's twerkin

Good luck assuming my age if u start from 13. And about money and infrastructure, I'm sure the I understand the importance of money at the age I am right now being in a lot of debt, but the thing is brawlstars is already using resources on maps, brawlers and skins (and even unnecessary new modelling) and even a tourney recently, but u feel like if they spend resources on a better reporting system, it's gonna be way too costly for them. I have no idea what's ur point of debate here but sounds stupid so won't even reply in this thread
---
Me tooüò¢
---
Lower her range and damage, and were good to go, lower her reload speed if u really want to kill her

They had us in the first half, not gonna lie

Holy crap this is actually amazing?

Someone said it, odds will increase as brawlers are added

Leon, he dropped 80 from around 510 and now im working my way back. Currently at 440. Just want to be part of the 500 club again
---
Lol people that commented "I like the new Rico" gets downvotes
---
Phew, just got star power for my Shelly at 404 trophies.  I guess I shouldn‚Äôt play her so I don‚Äôt risk dropping into no skill zone.
---
You should put the spring on the far left and far right so it‚Äôs like hog rider jumping over the river

Honestly thought he was going to jump the bull. Haha

If you don‚Äôt Pay2Win you‚Äôre a broke boi and probably don‚Äôt even own AirPods... losers

Yeah the message is.... upgrade mortis
---
I agree but who could make a better skin for it‚Äôs replacement ?
---
That's some amazing execution. A few milliseconds late jumping to that platform and he could've been hit by Bull.
---
How
---
Whaaaaaale
---
Yes

He's not a roboot. He is a creature of the mines who wears helmet.

Good work! I would buy it if i could

Okay and what about max accounts. They won‚Äôt be able to donate anything
---
FANTASTIC! 
---
YepüòÇ
---
why do ypu have 144 tickets, are you stupid
---
I mean I would consider it quite high. At power 9 he can take quite a beating, making him useful as a bodyguard. Maybe I don't see Darryl as a tank because my Poco has over 400 more health. I have a power 5 Darryl so :\\
---
Thanks, and yeah. I also understand that they're a small team, but they've been using that excuse for years. What's stopping them from hiring some amazing programmers or game designers. If their team was much larger, they could put mobile gaming on par with console gaming tbh lmfao. But yeah this community has some really great ideas but they fail to listen

I love GEDI KOR's skins but that one is definetly my favourite..

Yeah parsa üòÇ
---
Darkest Dungeon reference here?
---
Yeah I guess you're right, but still. At the rate their moving, this game will be long forgotten by the time the game reaches it's full potential. I wouldn't be saying these things to this extent if they rolled out updates often. But 3 months for skins and new maps is definitely not the move. New brawlers are cool but that should be secondary. The gameplay really needs to be upped. 
---
go into the subreddit, click the "..." on the top right of the page, and click "change user flair"
---
Yep. This way it's fair. ~~biased to Poco because he burst heals but ok~~
---
Ok 
---
Create new accounts, that way you can get chance to play all Brawlers in very short time. I have two accounts now and I wanna create a third one.
---
Yah that would be so useful.

This is just my friend right here. I have over double his trophies and every Brawler except the legendaries, and yet he has Crow, without a single Epic or Mythic.

Flor me 501+

No
---
This mode sucks. People complain about showdown being suck due to teaming but this mode also sucks due to many reasons. I bet people who gave on this mode won't ever play this again. 
---
BeeeeeeeeeearrRRrrr
---
My Leon too, but in this web site if you lose  trophys, when you open the web site, it show you the real current rank, but in brawl stars my Leon is rank 17

Its the first game for kids with battle pass, its fair they only know it from there.

Just like those Pok√©mon games when the text reads "that's enough. Return!"

Yea. It should be like that in duo showdown.

I'm at .0336% and I'm at 5.1k trophies. I'm completely free to play and I own both Spike and Crow. However I do not have a single mythic or epic on my account. I've been playing since around January.

I was expecting him to super into the enemy base with 11 gems... but not like this

Why not?

are you sure ?

Wth he have one of the best starpower y tf u want to turn it off

Wait are u serious? Because it isnt you're

I like this, everything should be considered. Like damage done to enemy, gems collected and held on to, enemies holding gems killed especially during countdown, Number of kills.
---
this ain't instagram boi people aren't gonna follow you
---
I dont get it, like what was the point of the vid, u said buff crow and then u win a battle with crow. I am confused!!???!

Gj keep going

when you lose in siege
---
"made obsolete by a new model"

*hmmmmmmmm*

Auto fire, Auto fire, Auto fire, maybe one with talent
---
Big box sock? HAHAHAAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!!
---
That‚Äôs what I was thinking as well.
---
I have 10 dollar foft card i will buy other one
---
I know im late but I feel like you should remove the beard and moustache. But good work! Keep making skins until supercell hires you! Maybe a spike skin?
---
Username checks out
---
I don't even care for new brawlers. Gaming has become so repetitive after reaching a certain trophy count, there isn't much incentive for me to continue playing. I think I'm about 60 trophies away from getting Dynamike... But ok?
---
 I ended up getting hooked on another mobile game that has many different daily goals, weekly goals, etc. Brawl Stars could be better and add so much more to keep players hooked.
---
Mortis? Hmmmm...
---
No U!
---
Fauk ryan franek fauk they all
---
You sucks I suppose you picked Dynamike to team, that's why you want to "fix" Mm. 
---
# never celebrate too early.

i mean he needs a buff come on
---
Why do I find this so flippin cute
---
It is wastier to comment in a waste of post, isn‚Äôt it? ü§î 
---
This scares me more than a bull in a bush
---
Imagine not getting shit out of each and every box.

If I would repost it again without Jump Pads then I'll have much to wait and people like the Jump Pad as ut makes them feel like HOG RIDDDDEEEEEERRRRR!
---
Dick is also a name. 
---
This isn‚Äôt clash Royale where you need to max out a specific deck. In this game, you want to max all the brawlers so i don‚Äôt really see the point of this 
---
Of course he needs a buff, but what is the ppint of the vid??
---
r/woooosh
---
report this guy already :'
---
that's fair but as of now, it's really not needed when there's no distinguishable factors between a top level player and an average one.
---
I was thinking of that, but the map is too spacy and Pam would Overtake any Bolt-Stealer!
---
The type of mod u speaking is Siege, nuts and bolts it's a map!
---
What is even different? 
---
This won‚Äôt become a map because of the one tile gap in the middle
---
hey add me at rokblox we play togeter
---
True, I think auto aim sucks too and there needs to be more abilities and game modes and stuff. But either way I hope this game doesn't become like league of toxicity lol
---
Yeah its a real pain and i went and soent the 5 dollars back hoping that would fix it 
---
Where can I find there page ????

---
I think that'll be boring for the brawlers who is in the other because you just standing there when a single person has to destroy one BIG safe!
---
Ok
---
I am not sure how much a spring-trap launches you and I thought it would be enough to get over the river!
---
They can change themselves after a fixed time..
---
The first el primo to ran away instead of fighting a bull like an idiot 
---
Even this is thousand times better than current model.
---
Truly a master piece.
---
Just stop autoaiming, problem solved
---
yes lol
---
Same
---
Brawler star is worse game
---
And if they stay in on the tower think of Spike users would dominate and their carton tower Wouldn't be let to destroy!
---
*Reads while making notes*
---
U just suck, sorry 
---
Wut
---
me too :(
---
What If it was a 2 tile gap?
---
yes with the power nine shelly

Wouldn't thay be bounty, as it its a 3v3 with unlimited FIGHT?

Yes! Fantastic!

A new customer!
---
Or camp. Or just evade everyone until there a few players left. 
---
shake my head my head
---
yeah
---
I would love to see this in the game, but don't you think Supercell will find it OP as you can finally max brawler because I am a f2p and I need 50 power points to get my Mike to lvl 9
---
Can we get an F in the chat?
---
My guess is just to see how high they could go, they already thought there was no chance of them losing.
---
he was the hero brawl deserves
---
Morris. The ugly cousin of Mortis.
---
The bull was rekt
---
No. 
---
I agree, it's not fair, I meant in a lot amount of maps the people just go to middle and star spinning, I really hate since the beginning they do that and they don't let people fight fairly 1vs1 I really comprehend that when is reaming 3 and one is even powerful than the others 2 the others 2 teaming to defeat the powerful. But since the beginning is really disgusting

How exactly does it work?

Yes but how does it help me get legendarys?

At least his bow has a string now

You won't respawn?

For the first time in forever.....

Oh look, there my Crow and Spike....IF I HAD THEM!
---
That's just Showdown except that would be 5v4vMe
---
Yeah, that felt so good watching him win! Those guys were effing bullying our guys
---
 Carl will be released with an update
---
In from r/madlads: what was OP trying to do with that Bull?
---
Bonus question: what was that Poco thinking? 
---
Simply your chance just get doubled with two accounts. Get tripled with three accounts and so on :) I couldn't get Crow in my main because I already have Leon. When you get any legendary your chance to get legendary will drop to almost zero.

They probably have more and possibly better ideas, the downside is that they need to make 3D models. His ideas are fantastic and I hope he gets an opportunity to work for supercell
---
It will be on 28-3-2019
---
Bo or crow if you like crow
---
This is not the general multiplication rule of probability lol, that involves multiple events occurring. This formula is derived from geometric distribution laws :) Btw I‚Äôve already explained how to find the real probability in this post but thanks for regurgitating :) my other account is ios_god_7
---
Because the token doubler offer gives you more
---
Where is his canary?
---
Randoms... well... it sucks. I play alone, and get shit teammates all the time.
---
Bo
---
Oh ok, but the idea in my mind that i wont have Crow on my main, original and beloved account is annoying :/ 
---
Also it means more playing and grinding to level up the brawlers. Also who knows, i already have 1 legendary on main account and i played since beta, BETA, what are the chances my luck gets better on a NEW account. I just want a better brawler system
---
used mom's credit card 
---
poco frank
---
I sent you s message, read it.
---
I'd take Crow's one.
---
played since beta, couldn't even get pass 6000 trophies lol
---
The fact that you think remodeling old characters are a unesscary shows how incompetent you are. 
---
Still here? 
---
Great play by poco 
---
Crow without his Beak
---
Bo isn't as powerful anymore, Dynamike is not so good, Crow is amazing
---
Really?
---
cope?
---
I would be so so down
---
im torn. on one hand, fuck OP and everyone that plays like them in matchmaking. on the other, props to OP for putting pride aside and sharing a personal lowlight to highlight their teammate
---
Thats to much coins per a donation bro!
---
Make it maybe 3 coins or like that
---
I understand why people think he's not joking. It's because OP is claiming it IS real, when it is clearly bad photoshop.
---
Why would it be?
---
Your comment makes no sense
---
Cool
---
If you‚Äôre skilled then take dynamike. Bo is not that good now since it‚Äôs only 2 tiles. Crow is also not bad. I would either take crow or dynamike
---
None of them, can get for free in boxes lol. I only have 2 and didn‚Äôt take long.
---
I mean if u by this get power 9 u can get star power and star power is big advantage maybe
---
You forgot a ¬´?¬ª
---
Y e e, im a undercover mortisüòà
---
I gave up at 6600, but I only have 15 brawlers. The rewards suck, so does the matchmaking, so does teaming in SD, and so does playing with randoms.
---
Yea, but its more like island invasion map, but due to walls and the positioning of the water it will not be disturbing
---
i underesrand the sentiment and I'd agree if they only had a few gems or even none. but when you're carrying 9 gems and run out into the middle of the battlefield, then yeah you're pretty retarded regardless of how intense it is
---
It‚Äôs photoshop.

---
Its a great idea however i am a little greedy and i dont see myself donating much cause we all need the pp in order to max our brawlers.. 
---
It works in cr cause you dont need all the cards but here brawlers are equally in use 
---
Awesome
---
Same here

Why Colt level 10 is not faster than Colt level 9? :/ I dont like this brawler in level 10 because is not powerfull than level 9

Repost

you mixed up other skins

Um the krusty krab and penny‚Äôs bag are both based on treasure chests so duh...
---
I mean you have spike so you win
---
except crow, cuz crow is black
---
That was after I got downvoted.
---
good not
---
So like an actual Heist, sounds interesting!
---
Imagine having no legendaries.
---
This comment was made by r/LegendaryGang
---
Yeah, you are right. By what? 50 boxes? Nice advantage you got there. If 50 boxes were all it take to get a brawler? Everyone would have every brawler by now. Just accept the goddam fact the original commentar is trying to state
---
Vi consiglio di cambiare mortis strega notturna  e un pochino sciocca
---
your kind has tilted me for about 3 matches 2 weeks ago. more then enough reason to exterminate this new found plage. call me doom primo

I opened boxes to get gene when he came out and got Spike instead

yellow crow? lets make it better, "ching-chong crow" (no offense)

I like your attitude, I will upvote you

*Dynamike wants to know your location*

But you can follow me on instagram
---
But Brawlers  who can jump over walls would be OP 
---
Yep . good in 1 mode, pam is op in every single one
---
Okey
---
Lol thanks but do you find any flaw in my arguement?
---
*Literally any chest exists*
---
OP: Hol up, ain't that looking like krusty krab?
---
How can one be that bad?
---
So you want a brawler that is not even out and gems because you don't get brawlers constantly?
---
Honestly spike saved the day twice with his supers
---
Good for Rico cause there are many walls to bounce off
---
It happened to me too...Maybe just a bug...Most likely to be solved in the next update... (not so game Breaking tho)
---
Oh no.
---
You‚Äôre supposed to have pictures to the left of the faces... u used the meme wrong
---
brock was laggin
---
Mate I'm at 4.2k with no epics and no mythics but 1 legendary. How?!
---
I feel like this wouldn‚Äôt be fun. Capture the flag modes don‚Äôt really work in moba‚Äôs and the reason why brawl ball works is because you need yo get the ‚Äúflag‚Äù (or objective) in the enemy spawn. This would most likely feel like the old heist and would be pretty much impossible to balance properly.
---
no problem it only deals 50 damage in total when lvl 10 crow

Leave them for 49 gems mega box promotion much better bro

and i can read your plays and jump also some of you are terrible at bush checking its really to doge dynamite when a bush...

I dont see Carl ingame?

Lol now daily rewards
---
Haha didn't know that
---
It's not a bug, it's just saying that you are gonna be by yourself against everyone, and duo just means that you'll have 1 teammates that you can't backstab
---
You shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to report someone for being afk. Maybe make it so that they get placed in a matchmaking pool with other afks for a few games but most of the time, the players who go afk don‚Äôt intend to throw. They just have to leave for some reason. A report button like that would most likely be abused and make many account get banned by players being salty over having ‚Äúbad‚Äù teammates.
---
This post is going to get deleted, you're asking for a brawler that isn't even out yet and gems

RNG sucks because they want you to spend as much money as possible. They know it, it‚Äôs designed

I made the same idea long time ago üòÇüòÇ look at my history

you can't read my plays. i MAIN dynamike. i can easily read your plays.
---
I think it would make the game frustrating, imagine you being bull, someone as piper exploding the tnt from a far range, we don't need that imo.
---
Ok I now understand why you are not understanding me. You are taking time played as a factor but I'm taking trophies as factor. Obviously the player who grinds more will have opened more boxes in the SAME AMOUNT OF TIME but the casual player will have opened more boxes at the SAME AMOUNT OF TROPHIES. 
---
Boxes opened by:
---
Casual player at 5k &gt; Trophy pusher at 5k
---
But
---
Trophy pusher in 2 months &gt; Casual player in 2 months
---
But it didn‚Äôt get put in, that‚Äôs why I brought it up again
---
what do you do when i dont make any plays tho
---
hahaha
---
I have got it too

Thank you for understanding me.

And then complain of lack of content?

But u covered his name

get friends
---
(im ready for the downvotes)

So is spinning and killing them right when you get next to them considered teaming?
---
What he‚Äôs saying is you can get pretty much the same amount of cash from playing like 10 games every 2 days and getting your 200 tokens + 5/6 star tokens compared to the cash you get from playing around 50+ games per day because the trophies road rewards + the 10 tokens you get from ranking up and extremely insignificant.

Why doesnt CTF work in mobas

You get downvoted because you're annoying, 30k karma and cares for 5 downvotes...
---
And yeah there are many flaws, when someone gets hated for having 23/23 at 3k trophies he is 100% gemming, definitely not played slow.
---
Then you explain how getting boxes works and say "not supercell's fault", but it's them that created this system, so it's their fault that you don't get rewarded for playing a lot, which most people regret. There could be plenty of other systems relying on the amount you play, how is this not supercell responsability.
---
Also you can see the guy is level 109 experience, that's a long time playing.
---
Supercell can find out his name by the tag, I just didn‚Äôt want to release his actual name tag

Ok, maybe fewer walls

*why you bully me*
---
I have played with this guy before, he is very good. He does deserve all those trophies(with 17 brawlers).
---
Is this confirmed? If so, that could suck in certain scenarios. Here's one: if there are teamers and you're trying to hide out to reduce your chances of getting teamed, the system is punishing the wrong person.
---
Wait. But wouldn't that be good for close range maps to have long range brawlers like Cavern Churn?
---
Is that actually you
---
I never said he didnt deserve those trophies. Actually, he is a kind of player i look up to
---
I like this idea :)

Thats a good point, and you are absolutley right! I checked his profile, on January 14th he was at about 3000 trophies, so he hasn't been playing for so long at all. He has Mortis and Spike, so he isn't even that unlucky
---
I would only play this mode if it were a zero risk mode. (no trophy loss)
---
No (my opinion)
---
Because, in brawl stars especially, mouvement speed isn‚Äôt really a thing and the map is so narrow there basically no way to go around your enemy to catch up to him. There is therefore no way to flank your enemy and ambush them. As soon as someone captures the flag, it‚Äôs pretty much impossible to catch them before they go to their spawn.
---
Nope lol, o just played him and couldn‚Äôt believe how a level 6 primo had 637 trophies on him lol
---
He has Mortis and Spike tho. I understand why he hasn't got so many, at January 14th he had 3000 trophies, so I think he hasn't been playing for a long time.
---
Piper, Jessie, Penny
---
Lmao just think about it
---
imagine having to bushcamp every game
---
-sharpshooter boi
---
yeah wtf
---
Talking kak ya
---
Honestly maybe its because im only 1900 trophies but i rarely get teamers in my matches, and if anybody spins near me, i just shoot at em till they go away.
---
Quite the opposite. Doing that more often discourages spinning-initiated teaming.
---
Whoo! Take the L!
---
The Dyna one is the best
---
Dead in the inside
---
new brock skin leak?
---
this is stupid for Max players and daily playing players , this is only good for nubs like you..
---
Is almost impossible to the attacking team win is so much easier to defend... also if the defender is killed it rewspaw invunareble near the treasure.
---
Much better, a bit more open for brawlers like colt to attack, but enough to cover tanks
---
Make it so you can only queue up random in solo sd only because it would ruin other people if you were to join 3v3s and events
---
So it would be a "Do it at your own risk" kind of thing
---
cool ;)
---
They already said they aren't going to stop this legitimate strategy. Spamming the reddit doesn't help. Give it a rest already.

Lol it's a joke, take it easy man
---
It wasn‚Äôt me asking it was me saying. I said ‚Äúwhy brawlers are‚Äù not ‚Äúwhy are brawlers‚Äù
---
Yikes, that's bad.
---
Overall, I don't like the matchmaking. Here's a different scenario I see that sucks:
---
Matching on brawler trophy alone is terrible when you are above a certain level (say, 3000 total trophies) and then unlock a new brawler.
---
Overall, you already know how to play the game, know how to strategize differently on given maps, and at least have an idea what every brawler can do in certain situations.
---
But...you're new brawler has 0 trophies and you get matched with other 0 (low) trophy brawlers. 
---
Which could be someone that just started and only has 50 total trophies. Someone that has no idea how to play the different modes. Doesn't know the maps. Doesn't know what all of the different brawlers are capable of.
---
Gaining trophies on a new brawler is always super painful and I just hate it.
---
What you at, 2k?
---
:)
---
im 3% black from my ancestors so i got the pass

THIS mortis no no i remember what he sa√∫de for me mortis the Devil o night:hey barley don,t be scared im Just say THE DEVIL O NIGHT. DELETE THIS OR DEVIL MORTIS WILL KILL YOU

The same joke literally every other post is about. It's getting old.

By you?

Yeah, i see his point. I have a friend who has 1000 lea trophies than me but has all three epics, and another near 2000 who got crow

---
This is a nice idea, but I don't like it. Firstly, we already get a random, free, daily item in the shop. Secondly, a daily pop-up minigame seems unprofessional; it's something I'd expect to see when I open word-cookies. 
---
Mexican Pesos.
---
All that means is that they don‚Äôt play very much. Unfortunate that the person who plays more isn‚Äôt the person who got better rewards, but sometimes RNG screws people over.
---
I was stuck on four non-trophy road brawlers (rares and Penny) for a month and a half, while a friend of mine who spent roughly the same amount of money as me had every rare/super rare/epic/mythic plus Leon in the first two weeks after launch.
---
Bo skin plz
---
This  why i never play solo ever again
---
Im pretty sure that is a good buff ezcept for the whole figuring out what % he needs for a good damage boosting star power
---
Imagine not being safe in your own home (bushes)
---
- r/BoGang (nahhh jk we Bo‚Äôs love heavyweights!)
---
Awesome map but careful the mods don‚Äôt remove it since that whole map Monday thing came out.
---
seems to be a pretty good idea, but i would add that it would have brawlers that are unique dressed like it is in the west.. and they characters would be all the same, you can't choose one from your locker.
---
SRRY FOR MY ENGLISH IF YOU DONT UNDERSTAND I WOULD WRITE A BETTER VERSION FOR THE IDEA
---
No premium PLS 
---
this made me laugh idk why
---
I am angry because there are people with 500 glasses and they have legendary and I have 15036 and I have nothing.
---
I completely agree with you!!
---
it should be a good buff that turns him back in to an assasin especially when i found how much of a percentage is needed for a good damge boosting star power rework
---
TNT was used back in heist 1.0 during beta haha you always had to bust a door before u could get to the safe / enemy field.

Imagine seeing things

Battle pass? HELL NO NO NO NO NO NO NO. But buff crow and add those skins

I'm glad

I dont want a battle pass in the game it's not a feature I would like in brawl stars.

The 11111, but the 20 brock‚Äôs a nice bonus

Agreed

I like looking  at the new offer everyday and buy the offer

But not this time ...

And for 4 days ... like wtf supercell I spend money on this game but I‚Äôm not buying a super star whit gems (maybe whit coins )  to expensive ü§®

Ahhh i dont see that :(
---
yeah should we roport this as a bug? i cant see anything there too
---
Yes battle pass, if you cant afford the skins it shouldnt matter either way for you. 
---
Why
---
I get the joke you made but teaming or not when you enter solo its 1v9
---
Yas!
---
More like you started playing hay day first then CoC then CR and then Brawl star. Oh did i forgot boom beach?
---
&lt;3
---
Look at my trophies
---
Well yes, but actaully no since teaming or not its 1v9 in solos
---
No it's supposed to be 1v1v1v1v1v1v1v1v1v1
---
You know... That's how Brawl Stars works.
---
Wtf how
---
I like this idea. Let's hope they add this
---
I have no more ideas so.. tell me some!

Incorrect, you team with the bush.üåö
---
Ohhh. Hi dynamike or barley
---
Do you keep playing after all the losses trying to get your trophies back or do you only play until you get the star token?
---
I wouldn‚Äôt mind the idea of a battle pass, but I‚Äôd call it a brawlerpass, as long as it costs less $10 or less and can reward me with more than $10 worth of rewards, it incentivizes you to play and it also makes playing a lot have more meaning. 
---
no battle pass stop copying fortnite
---
Cooool!
---
Its not a good battle pass look at the rewards there it is shit your getting no skins and more
---
Credit to u/Tagrez_ for finding this guy
---
Not really it is already p2w
---
More like Shelly valley 
---
It wouldbe cool
---
You‚Äôre right
---
thx
---
As you get to higher ranks, you'll lose a lot more trophies on losses, like the best example to explain is siege. Usually you lose 6 or maybe less on a loss, but higher ranks lose 10 trophies. So spreading it out on all brawlers is much better, as considering one has 10 brawlers to can even out the trophies on all of them to say 200 each and then easily get to 2000, rather than pushing with a select few only and then losing a lot of trophies on a losing streak.
---
I'd say you should focus on getting every brawler that you have and unlock to atleast Rank 15. As you push you'll get enough points and coins to upgrade all of them too. After rank 15 it's better to play with those who are at a higher level.
---
When you reach rank 15 with a brawler it's decent to have them at level 6 atleast.
---
If you're f2p, spend gems on token doublers, that's the best deal. Also do save for Carl, heard he's gonna be only 49 gems.
---
they wont
---
Yeah, I can‚Äôt even gain positive trophies and most brawlers are very boring
---
This is THE skin for Nita
---
I had thought that only when they do not donate anything can they be used again so there is not a total loss, but what you say sounds good :)
---
Nice, you should stay on 6969 forever
---
For 3v3 gamemode, I only play for token. But for solo showdown I play hours of hours trying to get my trophies back but fail due to teamers.
---
I thought the meteors are supposed to target teamers? Im colt being split pushed by two spinning crows and 5 meteors are chasing me into a corner.
---
How about some basic showdown?
---
Im curious to know the numbers for people playing the new mode as well. Is anyone enjoying that shit? I haven't played it since the first day it was out.
---
I really miss having a normal showdown and occassionally getting an extra showdown with a modifier.
---
you couldve at least gave credit...
---
Its made using brawl map maker (app store) 
---
I hope they put something similar to the clan wars :)
---
Not supercell fault and 23/23 are playing slow were false. Work your memory lul. And you didn't respond to my question, why you want everybody to take 18 months to max out if they have the possibility to play several hours a day, why not just players who play 10 minutes a day...
---
Happens because matchmaking wants to give you a "fair" experience, and at the same time not making you wait long for a match. I, for one, don't mind waiting 1 or 2 minutes to start the match. Also, playing as Shelly, Primo, and Bull? Matchmaking will try to its best to match you against the same set of brawlers. To make the experience "fair"
---
Thanks :D
---
Kinda hoping it‚Äôll be earlier than that
---
You‚Äôre a fxckn square for spending hundreds lol pretty sad honestly.. but whatever makes you happy in life ehh 
---
The daily spin would be cool, I like the idea of a login bonus, but adding more ways for supercell to profit with minimal effort on their end breaks wheel spin concepts for me. 
---
If the wheel spins are given to everyone and the premium ones aren‚Äôt completely overpowered compared to the daily ones cool, but wheel spin concepts are abused and just make players spend more money. 
---
The challenge is to outplay your opponents and most times modifiers imply others having a better chance of wining. 
---
That‚Äôs why a toggle button, so it‚Äôs up to whoever plays, either they like it or not.
---
with friendly fire
---
Same, why am I getting downvoted lol
---
My mans is on bright mode, your retinas will burn out. Come to the dark side!
---
Only if your not dynamike
---
good concept the health goes from 3500-4900 btw 
---
U should also spend that 1 gem and try to get 190 more gold
---
No, OP bought a pack that contained Mega Boxes. And well, you can't really refund the stuff you get from a mega box so the game just takes gems from you 
---
Perfect!!
---
there are some players that specialize in one brawlers or in several but not all, or just one that has just come out and wants to upload quickly :)
---
What are u tryna say bruh
---
It adds an extra element to the game
---
Thank you for supporting me and these ideas. Something must change! Something will change :)
---
My friend is at 4500k and he has no epics, mythics or legendaries...
---
So you manged to buy gems spend them &amp; get money back while not loosing the purchase? 
---
Thanks for all the tips!  So far I've been spending gems on token doublers.  I'm still only at ~450 trophies.  Spike is my highest rank at 10 (I just started playing less than a week ago).  I'll start trying out some of the other brawlers.  I haven't even played half the ones I own so far like Rico, Bull, or Poco.
---
U can‚Äôt afford any of the shop offers
---
And if you like the extra element then you can keep the toggle on, but for us who don‚Äôt then you have the option to play without it.
---
I like the part where you spin after you kill another player.
---
üòê
---
It's more important how many trophies the brawler you play with has. It usually starts occuring around 250-300 trophies, but starts becoming much more prevalent higher up 
---
Gene is nowhere good
---
Ayyy thats a filipino ad
---
He has 17brawlers
---
Brawl Stars isn‚Äôt ready for a battle pass yet. They‚Äôd need to make a lot more skins exclusive to the pass and they‚Äôd need to add more cosmetics besides skins.
---
That‚Äôs not the point
---
*I‚Äôm a clay figure of the night!*
---
I would like a new brawler named builder and his super was a barrier that lasted a few seconds
---
Ok, I did not calculate bro :)
---
No problem mate! You're doing great so far and yeah the other benefits of using every brawler for pushing is that lower ranks earn more trophies, plus if you can play with any brawler, you'll get super good at the game. Best mode to try brawlers is showdown IMO or if you play with mates choose whichever you're comfortable in
---
Yeah i know brawler trophies are the factor here, just wanted to say an average number. My shelly is at around 300 trophies and i rarely get teamers.
---
My favorites are dyna, spike, and leon
---
At least to be in the game!
---
Don't fucking complain
---
Pike
---
but actually yes
---
*walks bush into a bull*
---
Big fax
---
you didn't understand my intentions, or maybe i wrote wrongly, but the thing i'm trying to say is the phrase: "it gives other players advantage", didn't make any sense. The example you wrote over is right, but there are a lot of possibility (if you pick shelly on sd on a long range map it's your fault, meteors or not). But let's say that the map is good for every brawler (impossible but let's argue that). If you are the Shelly on the example above then yes is unfair (and if you is the colt or the piper??), but the meteor shower don't focus always you, the focus is randomed. If they team at 90% you will get destroyed by that team is classic sd too. Yeah sometimes the meteor "mod" is unfair, but if you think that mod should be removed cuz you always lost for that, maybe and i say maybe, the problem isn't the mod...  
---
ps:surely i made a lot of grammar errors (sorry for my bad english)
---
The idea is from CR subreddit lol
---
Only if the armour covers the bear better
---
Yes your opinion
---
Shit that's scary
---
I want this map ingame NOW supercell
---
Tank you^ - ^
---
I also prefer the old one, since it kind of gives us choice of when to regain the hp, but that doesn't mean that he is a good brawler. He is classified as "extremely situational" at best, only being good in showdown (not even top 10) and some gem grab maps
---
Aqui no se hace esto prro
---
even no leon
---
Dude of course I know, but this ain't FB!!
---
They will eventually decrease the needed trophies, this is just because replays take up a lot of server space.
---
Why are you salty?
---
Love it, though I think it'd be better with an actual PEKKA rather than the bear in armor
---
Yea took inspiration from him
---
The only thing wrong with all these skins is that they would cost so many gems I wouldn't be able to get any of them
---
Just learn how to spin and you'll be fine. 
---
I remember when some of my brawlers almost were at 400 trophies. Can‚Äôt even get shelly higher than 400 anymore
---
No thank you
---
Just because of this mentality, solo showdown is becoming trash.
---
True :))
---
Don't hate the spinner, hate the game
---
hes got skills to pay their debt
---
How many people got this offer in the shop?
---
Am I the only one thinking that his model is cool ?
---
DEMON!
---
Removed - Your post is too short, please expand on your title.
---
After seeing night bitch it‚Äôs obvious they need ideas too
---
Now im wondering too
---
Improvise, adapt, overcome.
---
Wow unluckiest person in this humanity ever to be alive
---
this happen to me when my game crashes
---
its so annoying!!!
---
Hear of a bAnk loAN?
---
crow is balanced
---
       Yes, now clubs are useless, but I still think that your idea of ‚Äã‚Äãdonating power points is stupid, the process of upgrading characters is fast enough.
---
       Better figure out how to make clubs stop being useless. For this you need to make people work together for the benefit of the club.For example, Club Games (like Clan Games in Clash of Clans)
---
I would put Pam as the team leader (I have seen several Soviet Pam memes, and am very influenced by them)  
---
Also, what about Nita and Frank?  
---
Frank would be the infiltrator, and Nita could be a "replacement mascot"
---
Nice :)
---
ARAM from League of Legends... Would work better on Bounty than SD in my opinion.
---
Can‚Äôt relate, sry
---
You probably left the game in between
---
I have 48
---
*ends up with lots of downvotes*
---
Hmmm so, imagine that they release the new update with Carl and other remodeling and skins stuffs tomorrow. It will be amazing. Fingers crossed.
---
If you blur out the name blur out the band too, because it's easy to find him 
---
I would use this if there was extra trophies rewarded for winning as a bonus. This would create a high risk, high reward scenario which I would be great when I want to live dangerously.
---
No it wouldn‚Äôt, it doesn‚Äôt fit in with how the rest of the brawlers look
---
I save my gems (only grind them into boxes) to doublers, is it worst to spend on a skin??
---
If these are ever in the news tab, I will get a 16 viagra boner
---
As much as Gedi-kors ideas are great, we have to remember they are ideas, not actual skins! It's a long process from idea and 2D model to full working in game 3D model... still I would love to see of them in game some day! 
---
I can't even get one gem, boi this man flexing
---
I get what you‚Äôre saying, but as someone with 17 brawlers, having been playing for 3-5 months regularly, and having over 6000 trophies with no brawler over level 7, I can attest to the fact that you should get more brawlers. I understand what you mean, but I‚Äôve still opened a shit ton of boxes. I‚Äôve even bought mega boxes. I‚Äôve probably opened around 10 mega boxes, so you can imagine how many regular boxes I‚Äôve opened. At the end of the day, it‚Äôs still based on luck. Which apparently I don‚Äôt have, since I don‚Äôt have any legendary, Pam, Tara, or gene.
---
Dynamikes brother
---
Fantastic work as always. I'm baffled as to how you can churn out these skins so freaking fast.
---
This is marvelous!
---
That's why I tell you to buff him
---
this the cutest shit i ever seen
---
Oh, I thought that maybe you have fun but teamers suck. Guess I didn‚Äôt read the rest of your comments.
---
Brilliant work like ever. Gotta love your skins!
---
Credits to u/Tagriz_ for finding this guy 
---
Damn
---
Forgot about Primo
---
Says the broken English Bastard who couldn‚Äôt think of a better insult than a quote that is extremely dated and look like you‚Äôre trying to fit in with the other assholes here that continually bash me because you believe you have the right to continually bash me (since this Subreddit is designed around toxic people who get overly offended overly easy.) 
---
I like but I feel like the bear pekka armour should cover it a bit more other than that it‚Äôs amazing 
---
I just want to unlock Frank or Pam....
---
I know SC has a small staff of devs si I know it will be tough to solve this problem but I have a few suggestions that might help. I'm not looking to debate because I know it will be tough to fix. I'm just simply throwing some ideas out there.
---
#1... I personally think banning people for teaming is a little extreme but I do think maybe if you ban them from playing showdown for an hour or so it will discourage people from doing it as much as it is now. I'm aware it isn't a fix but potentially it is a deterrent for doing it. 
---
#2... Allow people to report teamers after the match. Maybe once they get so many reports on a person SC can go back and watch their match to see if they were deserving of being labeled as a teamer. I know this will cost alot of time to set up and to be efficient but I think if there is at least a threat there of repercussion it will deter people from doing it as much.
---
I personally think this would be a great start for, not stopping, but deterring people from teaming. 
---
I my self bought it and I think it looks nice
---
Absolutely. When you play it every day, you deserve to get some characters. Hell, they could even add a system that includes: if you win 5 matches a day, and do so for a consecutive number of days (we will say 2 weeks) you get a random new brawler. (However let‚Äôs include that you have to be like 4000 or 5000 and above to unlock this feature.) Awards those who put time and effort into the game.
---
An executive in the mobile gaming industry I know. Is my source 
---
I tried to contact google but nothing so far and cant grt to anyone not from supercell or google
---
The game is hella fun what the hell . Your only at 3k cups and complaining that it's boring and getting to hard üòÇüòÇ you might as well just leave ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
no battle pass
---
ah I see, being more "tight" than the other drawings I made, I preferred to cut it out instead of maintaining the standard sizeüôÇ
---
Pushing to 300 is easy as hell. You can literally hide in a Bush all game and wait for everyone else to die. Not very fun , but effective. 
---
Again and Again, breaking the limits!
---
Same 
---
Do you know, why Dynamike wasn't there?  
---
Because he's teamming with zombies :D
---
That‚Äôs part of the making me uninstall, I lack the patience to play like that. I‚Äôve done it for sure but yea. I get you. 
---
Guau amazing
---
Will never happen, even if you paid Supercell to do it.
---
I‚Äôd rather this than siege (namely because the Meta might be better.) but Supercell doesn‚Äôt do fan ideas 
---
How do you know? Supercell said it will be in the middle of the month.
---
Okay, that was weird, but it‚Äôs a nice skin anyways!
---
I've said it on a similar post before, but shit like this is always rigged.
---
The better one tho. All you had to do was update the Skin Supercell, not add 200lbs to him 
---
#BringBackPortraitMode
---
Well you typed my acc name wrong
---
there's too many terrain, almost no space to move around
---
I just want a legendary 7k+ trophies, still no leggie
---
I got it from a leak. There will also be a 5v5 game mode. Also, supercell said In the AMA it will be released later in March 
---
That is really frustrating. But I noticed that if I try too hard to get my trophies back it gets even worse. A break really helps.
---
But nothing you can do against teamers tho
---
I dont understand why everyone wants to buff crow because he is already op.
---
You Got destroyed!
---
i thought it was only doing it to me
---
Me or your mom before she had you 
---
I love Mortis.
---
Because its a below 300 Leon. Well played though 
---
I understand you... But that's the idea, to make his armor a bit lighter, and balance the two references... Both Brawl Stars and Clash Royale.
---
Cool concept!
---
how is this related to brawl stars?
---
ShadowOfDeath
---
no i mean like 3 votes per day but only 1 vote for the same person
---
agreed, im at 7.6k and still haven't unlocked all the epics yet and no legendaries 
---
I wanted to be precise so I asked for his username
---
I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs how brawler drop rates work. If I get a brawler the % will reset to .13%.
---
And I can predict exactly how it will play out, Carl will be released and I will get him from a box 2 days later. Then it will take months to get my legendaries.
---
Rlly nigeria
---
Those conversions would be awful. The game states that 3 boxes = 1 big box and 10 boxes = 1 mega box
---
Its called Power Cubes you uncultered swine.
---
Absolute waste of boxes, 
---
10 brawl boxes are equal to 3.1 big boxes, not one
---
Good idea but 3 regular brawl boxes is one big and 10 regular is 1 mega so 10 regular for a big is like throwing away 7 boxes and 20 boxes if you make it to a mega
---
1. We can see it's Leon because of the super, stop lying.
---
2. How do you get -21 gems?
---
You speak portuguese ?

Ah thats a good idea

I think it should be nice if the players could turn on/off modifiers so if they are on you play against others with them on and off with others that don't want them.
---
That's a brutal work I love tron and futuristic things   
---
Teaming against 11 power cube Bull is okay
---
But what's the downside? Or is it just pure prejudice?
---
Wrong subreddit
---
Oh wow your posting speed is unreal. It‚Äôs becoming one skin idea a dayü§Øü§Ø
---
Shovel Knight is a game it self, brawlhalla just paired with them and made crossover skins
---
I absolutely love this since tron is my favourite character too! Just imagining what would this arcade shelly firesüî•üî•
---
It‚Äôs a meteor and they are annoying but useful
---
We'll be right back.
---
Ok then I agree with all that except for your proposed balance changes. 
---
Let‚Äôs look at what an assassin is now because you clearly don‚Äôt know that. Assasains come out of nowhere and delete you before you know what hit you, the downside to them is they are very squishy
---
- very squishy? Check
---
- come out of nowhere? Fat X except with the super but because it takes so long to charge, you‚Äôre barely getting 2 a game if you‚Äôre lucky
---
- delete you before you know what hit you? Also a fat X. Damage way too low. 
---
If you want to make crow an assassin rework the star power to be bigger hitbox/more damage on enemies with super, buff his super charge, reduce the poison tick number to balance it out. 
---
Also those buffs you just suggested are the stupidest things I‚Äôve ever heard, if you buff poison tick time then it‚Äôll be faster to die than to wait for poison and then heal. Damage shouldn‚Äôt be buffed except for super. 
---
Yeeee.... No
---
I mean I'm pretty sure they'd spot eachother if they were in the same bush and one person would attack. If neither do and they've seen eachother i'd consider it teamming. Like i said. It'd be if two players are within a close range of one another and aren't attacking eachother. Say about 1-2 grass blocks range. 
---
HAVE MUCH FEAR, MORTIS IS HERE!
---
Support != assassin 
---
Ofc
---
Either teamers and campers or meteors you choose
---
wee woo wee woo
---
copyright alert!
---
OK, I forgot this. Thanks for your feedback.
---
Bro you should be at 10,000, but you don't know how to play
---
Well what do u recommend then üòÇ
---
Realy i didt'n know this before
---
i have 2 legendarys at 3800 only brawlers i am missing are gene and spike. Am i lucky or nah?
---
Percentage + Luck + Unlocked brawlers percentage + Unsuccessful pulls = Prob. around 0.4%. When you unlock a legendary it goes down, yes, but it doesn't dissapear completely.
---
That's accualy genius.
---
:O
---
When you beat someone on the other team and they are power 10
---
This is actually genius, just make the whole bear look exactly like pekka and itll be perfect
---
Yeah that movie was like a 2hr daft punk music video. And it was awesome. 
---
I think Frank‚Äôs star power is the best.

How can we apply?

I have got 90 boxes ( not 90 regular but i count 1 mehga as 10 regular and a big as 3 so totally 90)
---
has great chances appear this skin in the game since the shovel knight already had direct and indirect participation in some games like brawlhalla, blaster master zero and smash bros ultimate.
---
Exactly what I was thinking. This is hilarious to me üòÇ
---
No, it's "Heist" , no "Hesit"
---
Outstanding move
---
Kinda hoping for a FBI comment
---
I'm reporting you for treason

you want to quit so you dont lose any more trophies but at the same time you want to gain back the ones you lost so you play again

A paid battle pass usually consists of cosmetics, while the free pass consists of rewards. Atleast that‚Äôs how it is in other games, and how it should be in this game

With clash royale, they removed the ability to add colour to names. When they did, they gave everyone 1 more free name change. Not sure they will with brawlstars though.

What if we buy you powerpoints with all the coins we have? And in return we get a few gems or tickets or points towards skins locked behind donation rewards?

---
Those are some good points, obviously im not a developper im sure they would come with a better idea what im trying to point out is that in case they find a way to detect teamers instead of bans they could choose trophie losses.
---
Also, no system is perfect, continuing to use overwatch as an example  many players get banned without deserving to.

Oh man how about a skin from that 90s toy set laser challenge. Being a kid from the 90s I would find this hysterical and dope.

It‚Äôs not really a mystery as to why is it?
---
Dilly Dilly!
---
There are no girls on the internet.
---
/s
---
Check their profile.
---
that is the frank we need  but just if they bring back the life leech
---
I got my spike from a normal box
---
Asymmetric maps are not fair
---
Crow, the most fun brawler to use. Leon a close second.
---
it's so sastisfying
---
The God of Skins did it again. 
---
I‚Äôd rather team with the power cube boxes
---
This looks pretty nice
---
Yup, you're right! 
---
But it could also help people who play one regular phones, everyone has its preferences; a moving joystick, what I call semi-locked joystick (the option available in the game) and the fully locked joystick I'd like to see in the game.

Oi, √© o "The Wizard Barley" da BS amino
---
Great win!
---
The true supercell fan will choose night witch mortis
---
Same, I got frank like a month in playing then piper the next week from a mega box. Been playing since Mid November 
---
Well yes, but actually no
---
U took it from Team Fortress 2 
---
Is this how minimalist art works?
---
Mortis gang vs crow gang
---
Buys package, opens boxes and uses gems coins etc then refunds it
---
9999 iq bear
---
I didn‚Äôt refund it but it made me do it for some reason
---
and crow tries to screw with it
---
You know what, reading back I made a horrible argument. Just ignore that.
---
Penny ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Both! Great job d-(‚Äúd-)
---
I love the spike bouquet
---
isn't this a repost?
---
Privacy? I did because everyone else is.
---
Yes. 
---
it's necessary to choose
---
English subreddit 
---
Then i would choose penny
---
I know right
---
why would someone do this? what if it picks a bull in bushless map? The bull would be tortured
---
Hmmm, looks alittle familiar 
---
He is not trash !! He needs a buff but he is a very high skilled Brawler and if you are good with him you can still win showdown.
---
I wish he could read this. I'm sure he will feel good with his work :)
---
That no was trash tho 
---
Shotgunners can camp the landing position, again
---
Yeah I‚Äôm now cringing now but whatever it is what it is üòê
---
*"You're welcome! What can I say?"*
---
Pam
---
who won tho?
---
lol, maybe
---
This is too accurate! I love this!
---
Poor crow!
---
99% would imply any weren‚Äôt...
---
Another kid in world history
---
Ops my bad then sorry
---
r/subsifellfor
---
Clock darryl?
---
Definitively.
---
agreed
---
Say what you want about bushes, crow isn‚Äôt limited by terrain. 
---
If bull or primo don‚Äôt have bushes they lose, simple as that. 
---
Put less bushes and walls in showdown maps, and buff el primo and bull to compensate for it, this way they can support their teammates in gem grab without having to rely completely on camping and hiding.
---
I've put a lil' sneak on ya'!
---
Definitively he needs a buff. Hope that supercell do something.
---
Yo could i use this clip in a youtube video?
---
Do you remember this is a kid's game?
---
Da
---
Heisenberg on the opposite team tho 
---
Maybe this is his gang meme: 
---
*Imagine having no mental support*
---
\- This was made by the SupportGang, and the funny thing is that gene is the only support brawler
---
(I love the idea, this is just my opinion and you dont have to agree.)
---
this would max out brawlers way too fast, say you request every 7 or 10 hours, that adds up. Now this is different for cr because there's 90+ cards. But for brawl where there isn't even 25, it's a great idea, but let's face reality.
---
Figho ci sta 
---
Saw*
---
Ami me toco el primo y no me lo an dado y me llamo ENXOFMR
---
Screw the fact that you don‚Äôt know how to do 3D models. Your art is insanely good and no one can compete versus this! Supercell should hire you regardless that you don‚Äôt have experience in 3D modeling.
---
It‚Äôs not  my video
---
They could do 5v5 club tower defense mode
---
ELLLL PRIMOOOOO
---
Adapt maybe you wouldn‚Äôt die
---
Well, it does, but it also targets random people which is very bad!
---
You never cease to impress me. Keep up the good work
---
B I just hit 3K and I have 22/23 EXECUSE ME WTF
---
True fact! 
---
to me, the only problem with matchmaking is the power leverls. Not have them being equal, but have them relatively close, like a level range. 1-3, 3-5, 6-8, 9-10
---
A price for progress
---
Creatures of the night
---
What‚Äôs the problem does this exceed the power points needed for power 10? Don‚Äôt know cuz my highest brawler is power 8
---
Lol! Leech is bringing you nightmares!
---
100% post worthy
---
Swear I've seen this before, but I think it was hand-drawn.
---
I‚Äôm currently 7.2k and still no Gene lol
---
Nice, you‚Äôre lucky. I‚Äôm 5983 and I still haven‚Äôt got any. Also I only have Tara out of the mythics. 
---
Cruff bow 
---
hell yeah we do
---
Primo of course
---
Agreed x2
---
I almost thought this was real until i saw the buff crow part.
---
I like choke points a lot, but IMO this is nothing \*but\* choke points.
---
i have no idea what is up with gene gang, but thanks for that grammar correction xD
---
FRIENDS = teamers
---
What kind of buff. Everyone says that Crow needs one but they never say what kind
---
What?
---
Should I make more?
---
Give this man a job
---
Teaming is and always will be part of sd... it makes it more fun and if you disagree then just don‚Äôt play the mode
---
surely best strat would be to just use melee brawlers and camp islands?
---
Do you want a name of it?
---
Congrats ! Here goes your award for the dumbest thing I've read this whole week. 
---
Thanks :)
---
Bullet Heaven 2 beats Touhou
---
Change my mind
---
Oh i mean being maxed at 3.8k isnt crazy or anything maybe he just hates piper bull and barley and never plays them
---
I like this, but just don't incourage a battle pass
---
Slick boots best star power confirmed 
---
XD
---
Lol you are so sensitive. You didn‚Äôt even answer my question.
---
Ooof
---
I advise you to change name and her eyeglasses to future shelly so eyeglasses would look like laser eyes
---
Not a bug in the game, just a bug in their morale code.
---
His name is in picture, lolz
---
Just pretend Brawl Stars is the supreme game and everyother game is a ripoff of it
---
Ohh wow!  Thanks for answering my question,  I already spend like 1k dollars plus on this game...  But i never regretted any of that.... 
---
I LOVE this idea , i never know what to pick i mostly play for fun so this would be amazing

These options will only show up on the r/Brawlstars home page. You might have to be subscribed too if you're not. I'm assuming you are since you're posting here.

Does anyone know for sure when he comes out? I had heard rumors that it would be 17th, Saint Patrick's Day.
---
"pointless"  Well your correct but i would love this , its a fun way to play and no using a random num generator isnt the same , because you get to know the brawler ahead of time , i want it to be a surprise
---
I don't even understand the matchmaking by this point. Is it not simple enough to create a power range will only a set of levels, ex: 1-3, are only paired up?
---
Omg you made me think of the same thing too now üòÇüíÄ
---
I think he needs a small health buff because his damage is low unless he hits multiple daggers, which requires him to get a little closer
---
tortured him to death by using her umbrella
---
New
---
This GREAT
---
5k, only has Pam and Mortis out of the rarer brawlers. Sixteen to play with. They are all rank 15 :(((
---
this is cute as hell.
---
More Like Omg Hell Yes
---
you could put on the floor "buff crow"
---
this brawler does not exist üòÜüòÜ
---
Wut? I don't get it
---
Why battle pass? Supercell doesn't want to copy fortnight. It's a dead game now that only kids play and we don't want brawl stars to go down that same road.
---
random number  generator isnt the same , because you get to know the brawler ahead of time , i want it to be a surprise 
---
How the frick are you so good?
---
random num generator isnt the same , because you get to know the brawler ahead of time , i want it to be a surprise

Idk any more, probably me üòú

Lol, what program did you use?

You could've gotten a legendary instead
---
She's gonna blast you into pixels
---
Mee too
---
What do you mean exactly?
---
I would do this because i play for fun.
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs possible since the last update
---
But in this game, map are very good for certen brawlers and terrible for others. However it would be a very awesome feature for friendly games! 
---
Penny

I would like it for all modes personally

Absolutely

Battle pass would make me a sad f2p

I would be super sad

Great vid! Keep up the work dawg!

thank you o kind person

Tilt problems too?

Yeah, something like that

Agreed x3
---
Gedi you never fail to impress ud

Now you have the best brawler :D 
---
I prefer none, #morti4life r/mortisgang
---
They‚Äôve been a thing for a while now
---
When you don't flip burgers for a living it's pretty easy. Gl in life there bud
---
Correct
---
Crow is so weak against pam. The teaming crows should've kill the two other teamers to make their species dominant /s
---
its  made by choice , if you get a bad brawler then its by choice.
---
Make text bigger next time so I don‚Äôt have to zoom in to read it. Good art though
---
Who wants a battle pass, it‚Äôs not the business model supercell likes to use and prefers to appeal to whales who play less often but want to spend money
---
Crow already got a buff... I know everyone on this sub are edgy immature middle schoolers and hence so most people want the edgy toxic based character buffed even more, even though he‚Äôs in a good spot
---
And lastly I‚Äôd be surprised that there would be a new Jessie skin based off of a concept art that took some kid 30 mins to do, especially because turning it into a 3D model takes many man hours...
---
This just continues to remind me how childish this community is

Use her super wisely

More like pay to troll

He Moans instead of roars when hitting with his tennis racket

That‚Äôs true but the damage over time almost doubles from the poison. I can see where you are getting at with the health buff tho

You haven‚Äôt seen the Fortnite one then. Try to say anything and your karma will get thanos-snapped without a reason

YesyesyesYesyesyesYesyesyesYesyesyesYesyesyesYesyesyesYesyesyesYesyesyesYesyesyesYesyesyesYesyesyesYesyesyes!!!!!!!
---
We all know what you did chief
---
So many good idea's &amp; supercell just gives u that Mortis skin -_-
---
Those were good days
---
Well what did they do? Did they seem like they weren't trying, just spamming autoaim? Did you contact support in game? They aren't going to make a report button is because there'll be younger kids trolling with report button. Getting banned for nothing is worse than losing to bad randoms. I understand what happened to you, and I also want a report button, but then we could get reported for nothing and then get banned. So I'd say forget that match ever happened.
---
Well yes, but actually YES***
---
Sometimes what one may call appropriate may be considered inappropriate to others. GENERALLY SPEAKING (I am NOT making any accusations, just explaining the process), a ban like this happens when a player is in a club/team chat, said something that another thought (NOT necessarily was) inappropriate, and SC's trial system (I admit I don't recall all specifics of their system) finds the reported player guilty and then issues a ban. 
---
What does this mean for you? 
---
Well, you will probably have to email SC Support to appeal your case or wait for the two days to pass by.
---
Best of luck
---
Just look away from the monstrosity and pretend it was never brought onto this cursed land
---
ok...i want this skin NOW!!! 
---
ps. you make better skins than supercell !!
---
You are right
---
They were just spinning on the spot. Never shot just wondering about.  And your right I just need to forget about it :)
---
There are literally the same picture 
---
Thx mate &lt;3
---
and throwers, especially dynamike, can just predicted the landing area
---
Np. Good luck on your next brawler
---
Hell yea dude
---
Yeah its okay i get your point though i understand that duplicate brawlers can be op, i was on stormy plains with leon yesterday and got a duplicate leon with a random we kept pressing play again and i ended up pushing my leon 600 easyüòÇüòÇ
---
who is that and why am i supposed to care 
---
is that a tie
---
Who is who? u/GEDI-KOR or Molt?
---
Next thing you know, you have all the brawlers, and you're waiting for carl to come out. Imagine the temptation of opening that box before a new brawler is released
---
this happened to me 3 minutes before and i came here to look at memes and make me feel less internal pain
---
this isn't working why would you do this
---
wait why?
---
Don‚Äôt forget poco
---
Gedi-kor
---
Feel bad for the frank, otherwise, kids should be avoiding bad habits from teamers
---
Hell. Yes. 
---
It was boom beach for me first. Never played CoC seemed to complicated.
---
Oh he‚Äôs no big deal, only the guy that‚Äôs been topping the subreddit with his skin concepts every single day for the last few weeks
---
Dynamike can kill mortis just like any other brawler can. Mortis just has a slight advantage, but dynamike can still win.

Oh ok

yeah I saw them, they‚Äôre elite

I don't know the reason. I saw Brawls Stars Official page post it on IG so i thought I'd warn you guys too. Tomorrow they are going to have a maintenance to fix some bugs and balance stuff.

thank you but i was just making a joke

Why would anyone wanna go into a game with a random brawler? What if you get a brawler that sucks at the mode you are playing on?
---
i‚Äôve played since launch 
---
I agree.
---
Agreed x5

Crazy as in a unique concept that uses an existing concept in another game creating on of the most unique and interesting maps that i would love to play

Well of course it targets random people, is there something your saying that I don't understand

Sir, I have a question.
---
Is your work solely limited to 2D or can you publish a 3D skin? 
---

---
Take the walls from the 2 choke points or make it wider cause they wont add 1 gap areas also probaly dont use barrels for the tower but this is just a eh thing its fine

... reading OP

Oh hey its you,I think you died no?

Thin ricochet

Needed more earrape

*Laughs in Bull*

Hence the statement: LOSING WITH RANDOMS
---
Yup kairos time informed us
---
Also spawns have a lil bit to much rng 3 spawns behind the tower like a golem wrk better
---
Max pam...of course they'll team against you lol 
---
I'm quite aware
---
yeah, we don't want maintenance on those servers
---
The enemy gene can pull pams heal station from your team.
---
Good to know!
---
This looks like an Orca brawler, and now I really want one ;-;
---
Enemy gene :)
---
Ur mum corrected it lololol xdxdxe smh

to show us skins could've been worse

It is a game mode that only comes during the weekends and use tickets to get tokens instead of the 200 daily tokens

Let's use proper grammar!

It's not a big deal but that doesn't mean it shouldn't matter imo

I still play it despite the overuse of Throwers and Hella Teamers,Sure as hell its annoying but I gotta get thru with it

yea totally agree

So if people in my game have 400+ i can access replays?

I love your art, I appreciate what you do, but I have a feeling this doesn't fit considering there is a star shelly. Sorry man, no offense.

I mean it‚Äôs supercell and they say that if you have a max account it will take you in between 200-150 to obtain and max a new brawler. 
---
what wave was that
---
I most agree with that lol
---
So bull falls back one or two tiles
---
This is my 1 year gem income
---
I think just keep position trophies and also get points for kills would fix solo showdown. Good idea though, better than most
---
it works, but do you know what works? being a barley breaking boxes for people, watching them fight, and when they are on low health, kill them
---
What‚Äôs the point of this? Idiots.

Ye, you saw the first version, made by me too :)

Really good concept btw
---
then I would still be predictable, and there are some walls

I have 600 boxes in total v:
---
No you can't. Even if it is the match you lose and drop under 400 you are not able to replay it.
---
Imagine not being able to move when attacking.
---
This was brought to you be every gang except r/frankgang
---
Slick Boots is really good.
---
That's right. After someone has 400+ trophies on a brawler, a replay is saved, visible to everyone that played that match
---
That's not berry nice of you officer.
---
What would happen if the removed the trophy system and all game modes are like the ticket games where you don‚Äôt lose trophies and it depends on how well you do is the quantity of coins and coins you receive, I‚Äôm not saying that all gamemodes need to cost tickets just remove the trophies.
---
btw, that thing on top of his hoodie is not his hair, it's part of the jacket, but nice art anyway
---
Like your name is any better.
---
279 trophy bo with 400 trophy brawlers?!
---
But how am I supposed to open 100 boxes with minimum rewards every time?
---
Ima be flat. I like almost nothing about this post. I hate the battle pass wall, don‚Äôt want a paywall like in fortnite. Though gedi-kor‚Äôs skins are good they are not supercell‚Äôs style of skin. The only thing I can agree with is crow being buffed, but at this point I hate hearing people whine about crow not getting a buff because of how much people whine about it.
---
dangit, what is with these furries?! also there was this tank ripoff of brawl stars
---
Thanks,this is my first post on reddit
---
Tron Shelly has a nice rack

You should definitely contact them. Your work is awsome man keep it up! Btw a youtuber named Molt made a video about your work.
---
was there teaming? if not, then the people who play leon just straight up suck

As you wish lol not gonna force you. I bought it hoping they'll remodel him and save some gems when the price goes up.

#OH I KNOW!!!

*my name is FuryPup...
---
Yep my enjoyment has diminished completely especially since they removed the ability to make a comeback after losing three matches in a row. Before the last patch, it used to be t hat if you lost 3 games in a row, you'd be matched up against a low level team so that you don't continue to plummit in losses and trophy counts. They have since removed this and now I'm losing 7-8 games in a row and happen to win by pure blind luck of being matched against the shitty players I had on my team during the losses. 
---
But good artwork nonetheless
---
This format is really old and overused 
---
But can't steal crush's heart
---
Better than accualy in game :)
---
when you give the power of photoshop to a dank memer
---
What about those who are Free to Play and are struggling to max out ONE brawler? We need more ways of getting coins or just give us more in the boxes. Thanks. :) 
---
In order to gain trophies in duo showdown you have to get 2nd place or better, it is very hard to push in that game mode
---
WhY u RePoSt uR oWn MeMeS?????

No you can't. You can just make the joystick stay in one place and not move to wherever you start touching

Honestly the best game subs I'm subscribed to are probably the Dark Souls subs. Everyone is usually pretty helpful and responsive. And there's not stupid memes going up 100 times an hour. 
---
That game came out recently so it‚Äôs a great ripoff 
---
It is not.
---
Fuck forgetting about it. There needs to be a report button. Better yet an avoid button if you don't wanna "troll" Enough stupid people playing the last thing I need in my games are people purposely giving the other team points by scoring on our own goals in Brawl Ball. 
---
well, there is no perfect way to push trophies, you have to deal with what is happening, or take a break from the game

That‚Äôs called a lose streak, it‚Äôs normal and a lot of good games have it.  Either deal with it or uninstall

Went on tilt yesterday and lost 300 trophies haha. Feels good man
---
I was in a gameroom
---
I think this post is saying, these 3 brawlers prevents healing.....
---
I play Solo cuz I don't wanna depend on someone from not dying,or I don't wanna be the screw up,,All I hate about teaming is putting effort into getting a couple of kills and power points then having 3 people gang up on me just cause I have more power than them 
---
cmonBruh
---
I'm glad he doesn't have star power
---
Cyka Blyat.
---
Ahhh, another Fury member
---
This is something I would buy 
---
How do you lose trophies then
---
Tron shelly
---
No...
---
I understand that, having stupid teammates, but i'd say just take a break for a little bit from the game, or wait till the next update for more content
---
Awesome as always sector! 
---
Take a drink every time someone says this originates from brawlhalla and no shovel knight
---
Mortis gang will love this
---
Teammates were chill about it because we all got hype about the primo move
---
Yeah Boom beach is a nice game But i left playing it because lost interest too quickly. People say the game died quickly.
---
Love it! The club name and player tag are way too op 
---
I'm not asking them to revert anything. I'm asking them to add the option for tap to aim.
---
Omgg this needs to be fixed QUICKLY! supercell this is a game breaking bug and the game is UNPLAYABLE pls fix it as fast as you can!
---
what idle said
---
You can even make 3+ 
---
:(
---
Actually my pc cant handle tf2 :,(
---
Repost (someone continue the chain of this chain)
---
Yea I only played it a couple months until the smoky warrior combo became too OP.
---
That‚Äôs not even a pun.. criminals like you used to have standards...
---
Yeah I know but it looks cool 
---
Dang she needs a remodel....
---
Well it's at least the definition I used
---
I like the idea but we don‚Äôt need it because you can easily max your account 
---
yes it very oo
---
Just wondering, how would you activate your super with that control, I've seen in beta playing before through videos
---
My friend says smokey warrior and smokey zookas are still op, lmaoüòÇ
---
Thanks man!
---
Yeah, isn't that what u were talking about? Touching and aiming?
---
Penny, darryl, rico and tara!
---
Meteors hits me every time but near me isn't anyone
---
Legit, I would spend hours on end, gaining 30 trophies, only to lose it in about 5 minutes. SIGH.
---
I know, I actually made an email with karma before even knowing reddit ever existed, but at least it's not the n word
---
Ooooh, nvm. I realize what u mean now. Misread it
---
What are your thoughts?
---
That is the cleanest thing youve said, ever.
---
Same bruh
---
Why don‚Äôt you apply for supercells job?
---
Besides that it it just a different visualization of a brawl box. It's just a radomizer. 
---
Ask u/sector03, he's the OP
---
Looks great I‚Äôd love to see that
---
Hmm... once I lost 200 trophies with my 400 trophy Frank
---
You should post the big version of that 
---
The opposite happens to me. I get hit by a meteor when two brawlers are chasing me.
---
r/crowgang 
---
Me too also meteors are aids too they are supposed to target teamers but no.why would they? Lets just attack a guy just trying to stay alive against 7 people teaming (me)
---
Do you have a death wish?
---
Still having this issue...all the time... (on an Essential PH-1)
---
I think you know that this mod for 3vs1
---
Soild Point , but most people who care about grinding up the ladder will be with team comps any way
---
Bad are and SPAM!
---
Thanks for your art post! If you are not the creator of this work, please make sure that you have included the source, or to  comment it here! Unsourced art may be removed if you are not the creator.
---
Oof, that's tough. My shelly dropped from 420 to 280 before.
---
Replace the animation with their _geo.sc3d files! Contact me on the Discords if you want me to elaborate more.
---
the old super button. it would take up a tiny space on the screen and you could press it to activate and unactivate super. much better than the super joystick imo
---
How many trophies do u have
---
I remember watching masterov videos of the gameplay. Can‚Äôt seem to find them anymore.
---
Cleanest statement said by you
---
Mabey Carl was deemed op in a way so thier changing it I Don‚Äôt Know ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
I actually did that and my friends were so mad!
---
The most annoying teamers- franks, dynas shots you can atleast dodge but franks charging their supers together...there is no stopping that....
---
I find the joysticks annoying sometimes because they overlap
---
Lmao the thing is, supercell already knows that al these community ideas are viable solutions to teaming, they are just choosing to ignore them. 
---
Let‚Äôs be real: Do you actually believe for a second that a player can‚Äôt click and read to see what an event modifier does? Apparently supercell thinks their player base is retarded and removed life leech for that reason.
---
Battle passes would honestly suck get that out of here

---
Hi! 
---
Frank, Ryan and Dani. 
---
 (I'm also called daniel xd) I love brawl stars and you guys are great, and thanks for keeping this game well. 
---
But I wanted to ask something: and; Are they going to add emotions or dances like that (not to make fun) just to celebrate? * so the game would be more fun * 
---
They will improve the game graphics (so you look more realistic xd)? 
---
The battle pass as how much it could cost (if they were to take it out)?
---
he WAS on for few seconds 
---
Good idea but extremely cursed
---
I'd rather wait to see remodel after this gem of a skin.
---
No, plz no, this is no EA
---
I have private server for carl and it ends in "." Periods
---
And usually it is accurate 
---
Almost 5000
---
Even I had to go against Glizzyboy twice, but not in back-to-back matches ;(
---
Yes because they are the ultimate chippers but Pam doubles up with extreme dps too tho
---
You're right.....
---
HE IS EXTREMELY FABULOUS!!!
---
It's not the servers... Port forward your router would be my suggestion.
---
Oof ikr xD
---
Yeap a random brawler mode in showdown would be so cool 
---
Thats the definition i mean in my username, and what i saw in your username
---
Well it depends on how long you've been playing. I'm at 4k and been playing for 2 months, so I'd say me having all super rares and lower + crow is pretty average luck.
---
because opposite gender skins was a cool concept, not because its trans
---
Exactly. Clash is a 3 year old game so yes it has plenty more content, but brawl stars has absolutely nothing to grind for. Rewards are garbage for pushing, new brawlers arent that great because leveling them up takes forever. 
---
Yeap like a new mode in showdown where all the players who enter use a random brawler chosen by rng
---
Damn vro she thicc
---
A report button will just promote violence. Everyone gets frustrated with trolls, but at the end, it doesn‚Äôt really benefit you.
---
He said he uses Photoshop
---
Respawns like this is the reason I hate duo showdown
---
That intro gave me cancer
---
So trans skins are a cool idea. That's literally what it is
---
I'm also still struggling with this problem to this day. It most definitely has *nothing* to do with network connection *nor* auto-walking near a wall. It feels like an issue with input. The movement control would just stop working. Randomly. All the time. 
---
Frustrating is an understatement. 
---
Not my video üòú
---
It would be awesome if they add a new showdown mode where everyone enter with a random brawler. It would be so fun.
---
Ricardo Milos for sure. He needs a real hard nerf
---
This is incredible ! Man i wish i was atleast 1% talented as you.
---
They need to remodel first duh....
---
It is not your idea, give a credit to the u/Sector03
---
Eh, it's bad but if you play well you can survive it still. Important part is to clear enemy brawlers so you can maul on the bot and then slow it down with everything you have. If you can't clear enemy brawlers then try to keep it right on the edge of your IKE range for as long as possible, so that your IKE still shoots it but enemy brawlers can't get in and deal damage to your IKE. 
---
I hate everyone that has at least 20 brawlers with less than 8k trophies 
---
„ÄäIs this 3D?„Äã
---
If u/GEDI-KOR is actually learning 3D/wanting to learn and looking for 3D drawing classes then I'll shut up on this subject.
---
Yo this is Sector03‚Äôs post you reposter
---
Oh no 
---
I really don't understand the appeal of these types of intro, but if I were to give my opinion on this, the majority of the games shown in the video are more akin to mobile legends, which in itself is a ripoff of league of legends. So basically these games are ripping off a mobile ripoff of a popular pc game.

I wanted crow. But now I want this skin. What both have in common - I will never get them 
---
If the super is for escape rather than burst damage then he isn‚Äôt an assassin. Which is the problem because he doesn‚Äôt have the stats to back anything up. 
---
Probably a better mechanic for his poison is poisoned enemies take extra damage from crow, and then he can actually be an assassin. 
---
Agreed x69
---
Not your idea give credit and cont take square pictures they suck like your repost 
---
Do you know what trans means? You're transitioning to a different gender. Mortis is not transitioning, its just a skin.
---
That or future shelly
---
Really ? Could not find the concept anywhere, so I thought I was the first to design the Idea, I might be wrong :/
---
That's looks like Frank Star Power, better remake it. Every Star Power should be unic. 
---
99% of 20 is 19.8, which rounds up to 20, so no, it doesn‚Äôt imply that
---
Wrong spot
---
bad
---
You've stolen my no face pam!
---
Depends on game mode for me; I run penny in duo showdowns for the strong splash, but prefer jessie for pretty much anything else 
---
Agreed x693¬£69
---
 I was just playing (iPhone X) showdown and in a game when the map (Scorched Stone) expired. When that game was over and I tried to "play again" it first said the matchmaking failed due to the expiration of the map but then started me in a new showdown game on the new showdown map (Hot Point) but I never received the 10 trophies I usually get when I download the new map every 6 hours. 
---
It may be your internet , r/crowgang, they have a team of less than 15 people. 15 PEOPLE THAS NOT MUCH
---
Nita
---
This would be something cool. Maybe like clash royale‚Äôs system a little
---
5V5 and Trio :)
---
This isnt that necessary but I think this should come in like the next next update...
---
I came up with this idea in a comment
---
But is 19.8, 20?
---
You do understand the game will not survive unless they are making substantial money right? Brawl stars isn‚Äôt even scratching the surface of how much money clash royale or clash of clans makes. 
---
No way. Even though there needs to be more of a reward being in a top club, this would not work
---
But it‚Äôll most likely only be cosmetics. I don‚Äôt see how that would be Pay to Win
---
He went from male to being a female skin
---
Its so bad its actually funny lmao
---
I played clash Royale in its very early stages and stopped, so I'm not sure what you're speaking of, haha. 
---
I think pumpkin spike could be cool, like for halloween or something
---
I'm waiting for "this better than nwm" 
---
Me: No, both are great
---
OoooO 5v5
---
Very cool map although the high amount of bushes scares me a little
---
Epic
---
Well what happens if you have all the brawlers? Do you get more tickets and gems?
---
Nice reason on why.
---
How cr did it
---
U can donate as much as u want if its max but u pay little bit of coins
---
And maybe earn 1 gem per 5 powerpoints donated
---
What mode/s did you push on? 
---
"skin"
---
Supercell said that they weren‚Äôt going to do anything abt teaming
---
Ok dude, at this point supercell should really really consider hiring you just from the shear support you get and the awesome skins you make.
---
You mean S üÖ±Ô∏è I K E
---
Only male understands this? Btw, I pee while sitting because of my "lousy aim"
---
The Healing Pod.
---
Cuz he used his super after a split second but he is actually on all pictures
---
Then dont play shelly, you see that was maybe the problem...dont play shelly that much on maps that are not good for her, play other brawlers and dont autoaim justa  small tip.
---
good suggestion üëç
---
You mean like how to get back your lost trophies fast? Not sure I understand your question
---
Hot
---
When is available the new brawler Carl???
---
It is in game files
---
They just don't know HOW to implement it and make it balance
---
I did the same thing
---
Cuteüòç
---
Thanks! 
---
I love it.
---
I think its AS OPPOSING team
---
When u wanna heal but if opponents are pam gene and crow, U r screwed 
---
This is my favorite second and only to ducky crow
---
That's a really good idea. Also, the damage is to help him when escaping, it's an addition and that's really how it should be played and it takes away nothing from being an assassin, it's to escape. He needs to live if he wants to kill them.
---
You don't get it? 
---
The TNT box would start to spin

Imagine posting memes at 4.25 PM in the afternoon

this meme was brought to you by ME

Lmao if you make it a gif you can‚Äôt hear it XD

if they were to release this i think it would be a practice only map 
---
Yikes
---
Bro you are fucking insane
---
This could be a good skin for CR's 4th birthday
---
It's a Clean Map, But You should name it "MAP FOR BULL, SHELLY, AND PRIMO TO FIGHT ON AND NOT LET ANYONE ELSE EVER GET A KILL." 
---
Really good job, but is it just me or does this skin looks kind of like Lynx from Fortnite?
---
You did not come up with that, at the very least give credit
---
The force is strong in this one
---
I like it üëç
---
O Snap, I'm sorry for your loss of time op

Absolutely incorrect. He is the most hideous gremlin to walk the earth.

Imagine this men poping up at 6:33am cause of time zone

Where did our leader go
---
C'mon

In their AMA they said that they're fine with teaming which, i disagree with.
---
\-This comment was TOTALLY made by r/dynamikegang
---
No rico is the most thicccccc
---
Just in time to catch the bus to school

Pls make skin for piper!!!

I hate you

My brother make this , he is 10 . Thats a great drawn for his ageüòê but sorry üòâ

Custom proof pics, 5v5s, trips, and Carl. Your a lil goofy

Yup, when not pushing for a Crow buff, I joined the Mortis gang about 1-2 weeks ago

I have an idea: Yeti Nita.
---
Nice one! Hope you have fun with your Leon.
---
All these people screaming ‚Äútiltiltilt‚Äù dont know a thing

This is much worse :(

Nope

We just going to ignore he stole this from claygm

Yeah, it makes me **laugh**

Brawlhalla is my life. But its indeed a crossover from Shovel Knight

thanos walks into room. ‚ÄúNope‚Äù
---
You missed leon, and i main him
---
This would be the dopest skin in the game
---
I pressed exit ;)
---
The one on the right?
---
what are gems
---
I'm loving these tips! Try sharing more Brawl Stars tips so the community of Brawl Stars gets to know you! 
---
I have leon, i just want mortis. I love fast brawlers.
---
I‚Äôve won once on cavern churn just to prove a point
---
Thank you man!
---
Save your super, always aim it, and make sure to support.
---
Yeah, it's so fun getting targeted by meteror and teamers. 
---
As a Shelly main... I NEEEEEED THIS
---
You are still with one legendary brawler to get..,
---
r/pamgang
---
It would have been faster if you replaced leon with a blank sheet of paper...
---
Cool idea but this seems a little cluttered.
---
Pretty sure that leak was fake. It listed items that were primarily relevant to reddit topics.
---
Can I request a brawler?
---
Wow best Skin
---
Stealing -100
---
Congrats!
---
My first one was poco, I remember how good it felt. 
---
And that Jessie is fucking 12!
---
Both of those "friends" are just going out of the AOE because literally no one gets hit by these meteors
---
Only post maps on Mondays, mods may take it down
---
Because I'm tired of people like you being involved with video games. Something about gender comes up in games and people like you are on it praising it with your life when it's literally not that great. Or if the general community dislikes something and it has to do something with gender people like you hop in and defend it to the death praising it more and more
---
Hope you find him soonüëç
---
Man i lose just 20 and i give up for the day.
---
How about no or a button that just deletes 5 trophies?
---
Just tryna day how insane my luck is except for Darrel and you guys are just saying ‚Äúbe happy‚Äù what do you think I‚Äôm doing being sad that I have Leon and not Darrel? This picture was taken a month ago and I forgot about until now. I thought it was strange that I managed to get all the good things before Darrel. I didn‚Äôt mean to sound like I‚Äôm humble bragging jeez.
---
Do you mean spaghetti.
---
Hahahahhahahahahaha
---
I have no life;(
---
Best one I've seen so far
---
Dynamike is a better target
---
This post was made by the mortis gang
---
this is my favorite one yet
---
No battle pass for fucksake

Imagine needing to get close to your enemy/stay away from your enemy/check bushes/use bushes
---
-Leongang
---
Shellitron!
---
Yeah lol, but she kinda looks like 7 xD
---
Didn't mean for it to sound rude, just didn't wanna add an overused "lol" or "haha" to the end of it. I did find it funny, just yeah, it seemed like you were bragging.
---
It's another godly skin, but I'm not sure the name fits.
---
Don‚Äôt worry it‚Äôs not that good of a deal token doubler for 50 is 1 gem difference
---
It was littarelly like 3 months ago
---
Grinded 10 boxes for what box?
---
I played 3 days after beta launch btw
---
They should delete his account.
---
Thanks üòÅ
---
I was talking about the title not the name. Ricochet is used in english too even if it was a french word first
---
If you don‚Äôt want to I totally understand, but I‚Äôd love to see this in color!
---
I‚Äôve never experienced it and I have an old iPhone maybe you guys gave too many apps running idk
---
I want "Bo" to be remodeled.
---
Then the game would be less fun.
---
She's pretty easy to kill
---
And when did you start playing
---
You shut your mouth.
---
Okay sorry I get trigged easily
---
This is not how venn diagrams work. You're saying that people who want crow buffed simultaneously have him and don't have him.
---
I gained like 300 only today. I'm at 6k now so idk maybe people aren't that skilled at my level. 
---
My life is complete at the moment. You should see a therapist though.
---
No i see what ur saying, but If u go into an open map and get a tank, ur screwed. And u easily could‚Äôve avoided this by choosing an appropriate brawler to play. This can be fun if it‚Äôs not ranked where u don‚Äôt get coins or cups
---
1 gem 
---
*WHO WANTS SOME TNT*
---
Come on shovel Mortis, please be in this Assist trophy 
---
It‚Äôs...kinda cute
---
you choose this by CHOICE you dont have to thats the thing
---
f2p are the best
---
Ok I gotcha üòâ
---
Im f2p and I have 20 brawlers. Currently sitting at 10,040
---
It is from the game shovel knight, one of the best modern platformers. 
---
Hey Gedi I have a skin concept but I can't draw so I want u to draw it, its called "Lazy Gene," he is wearing pajamas and his lamp is turned into a teddy bear or a controller. I hope u read this :)
---
sick. i‚Äôm f2p 17 brawlers. 7k trophies
---
Hola me gustar√≠a que pudieran meter mi skin de Le√≥n

It looks like those bullet things in mario

Now you should be able to push him to 1000.

"BROCK IS OP!!!"

If it was life leech then it'd be 0.01% normal 99.9% modifiers and suicide rates drop to 0%

I‚Äôve gotten lucky, I just hit 2K and have everyone except for anyone mystic or legendary
---
BTW    I had to lose some trophies to make this lol
---
WAM BAM
---
I wish

Gem grab and siege :)
---
having slight trouble with the constant needs but I'll make it work
---
this would be awesome i cant see everything iv achieve and show off to all my friends üôÇ 
---
Absolute madman
---
This is a really good idea and should be in-game! However, if the level of the brawler is 10, put a star behind the number, like in the real game. 
---
i only like the battle pass
---
That's true. It felt awesome. Bad thing: can't play Pam anymore :D
---
What will the normal attack be? Like pancakes or what
---
7200
---
I was about to comment: we already have an arcade shelly, before I realized that she is actually called star shelly

Supercell should be like *I'm about the end this mans whole carea

You‚Äôre at 3k with a legendary and two mythics. What?

Let's hope she's is over 18 because everyone is thinking about that. Let's be real
---
I don‚Äôt think so. Just remove the one tile gap and it‚Äôll be lot better
---
Thing is, I don‚Äôt have any of the legendaries and I have been playing since beta
---
I didn‚Äôt get penny until 5.3k lmao
---
What are these gems??
---
is that blue shirt kid
---
Did you just insult the best/edgiest skin in the game?
---
Poco: Guy who unexplainably carries them all to victory despite being the worst guy for the job

PENNY

_"It's not a phase, mom."

Poco's the guy who winds up saving them all on his own despite not being fit to do that at all

Yeah she twelve... She‚Äôs really horny for her age group though. She F‚Äôd her parents then killed them so now I take care of her.
---
Amazing skin
---
Bit difficult as darryl without his super
---
Thank you so much 
---
I lost hope a week ago.
---
You don‚Äôt actually pay coins in clash Royale. You gain coins for donating and lose coins for the card so it‚Äôs actually a wash. 
---
Also gems for PowerPoints is way too much, supercell wouldn‚Äôt do that

That doesn't happen

"Don't repost please" lmao good one, OP. 
---
Players with 1000+ Brawl Boxes don't want to "open all" them. They want to open a few dozen or hundreds, until they get a new Brawler, then they stop.
---
Rico is post buff so he wins
---
Oof 100
---
I pretty much play solo sd exclusively. On siege it‚Äòs eiher total domination when the other team can‚Äòt even leave their base or utter failure when my team gets recked after 30 seconds. Not a well balanced mode in my opinion.

I feel like modifiers do help reduce thrower teaming

I wanted to, couldn‚Äôt find a good picture for it

Uh... why choose?  Threesome?

You can choose a flair on mobile too, justo go on the three dots on the top of the subreddit front page and click to ‚Äúchange flair‚Äù

I have to give the OP credit for trying to find a solution to teaming, but I still see issues.
---
Example:
---
I am in a battle with 2 other people, guy A and I fight down to 10% if our health and guy B picks us both off. Under the proposed solution, no one gains trophies (and this situation is very practical and possible). This could annoy and frustrate players who don't want to fight to death with everyone they see.
---
However I do have some ideas which may help.
---
1. Bigger bounties: 2 power cubes per defeated brawler can raise the temptation for betrayal.
---
2. Invincibility time for defeating a Brawler: Allows people forced into teaming (3 or more party teamers) to backstab and have a chance of surviving the backstab.
---
3. Choice of Modifier (only after reaching enough trophies to understand the game): Having modes like Meteor Shower, Angry Robot, or Life Leech (presuming SC brings it back) allows players to play in anti-teaming modes.
---
4. Have a new 'building' with pretty long range that damages Brawlers if more than one are on range. Not the best solution IMHO, but it might help.
---
5. Allow Brawlers to charge supers when hitting Boxes. This might be a double-edged sword, but often times a super can break up groups of teamers (a Primo vs throwers), While teamers may want to reserve their super for an emergency (or just backstab with it üòâ).

Cheers

Mortis Gang is happy for youüëäüèª

HELL YES would love to see another Shelly skin or even just deigns from you on shelly üëçüëçüëç;)
---
Beta version
---
That mortis was so good
---
Guys, we need to stop giving Piper some sugar.
---
Leon is kinda overshadowed by spike now
---
Leon

I pretty much never see teamers up until 350 trophies per brawler, and even then it‚Äòs pretty rare. Once you hit 500 and start your first game at 500+ tho it suddenly becomes a completely different game mode. Teaming goes from 0 to 100 instantly, everyone spinns immediatly
---
That would be nice, but no, we get Night Witch Mortis now available!
---
I agree. I‚Äôve seen her be charged in the beginning of a brawl after just two shots. 
---
sorry im a little slow but where lmao

Sorry people she‚Äôs a bit sexual these days
---
Yes, in the same way that two students are using the strategy to look at each others papers during a test.
---
Most call that cheating‚Äîmorons call it teaming. 
---
Once you hit 500 with a brawler, it becomes a completely different game mode. Got to 500 with shelly easily without seeing any teaming and then at 500 suddenly everyone teams
---
Mortis, I main with Pam, Darryl, and Frank, feel my pain.
---
Dafaq I got penny at 3.8K

F in chat for you

Hello supercell friends I would like to let me change my name again please, my brother changed my supercell account name ... I also want to give me the lion that is my dream, I understand if you do not want to give me the lion, ;) I hope what if EXCELLENT GAME SUPERCELLL !!
---
Smite this filthy pleb! 
---
Did Crow cross the border?
---
Sc explicitly stated that they don‚Äòt want to do that. Stop bringing up the same bad ideas again and again
---
Time to charge my super
---
Yeah, they are they are the cornerstone of this game.
---
Whats the problem?
---

---
r/mortisgang Unite

Supercell has stated that teaming is NOT cheating. Who are the real morons here? Those who accept that, or those who ignore the facts and attempt to continue to portray themselves as the victims of a crime that never happened? 
---
Legend. Simply a legend.

NITA IS BAE
---
cough cough that‚Äôs what you get for bush camping as bull cough cough
---
Made a part 2
---
How much trophies??
---
!normiebot
---
So maybe a health and charge rate buff. That‚Äôs a good point about his super being situational but I think his damage is fine considering the poison basically doubles the amount of damage a dagger does.
---
He needs to mythics and one Legendary
---
lmao
---
I said glitch....
---
Nice piece of work!
---
Two dyamikes

Eeeeeeellllllllllllll            Ppppppppppprrrrrrrrrrriiiiiiiiimmmmmmmmmmmmmoooooooooooo

This would get abused so much by people creating dummy accounts just to juice up their main.

I know I would

Nowhere to be found... but there is THICCOCHET!

Nope just legendary Frank Edit

Yeah Because of us P2W players the game got more stuff... It's like we buy alot,  They create alot.

Broken?

Is it just me or are all my match ups with p2p players?

I d k

Anyone seen my niece? She goes by the name u/JunkyJessiePussie and she just keeps escaping if you find her DM me plz i need to tie her to car Goddammit

Use english

Don't they already force you to buy some skins within a time frame unless you want to miss it?
---
No [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/aadlqq/i_love_this_feeling/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app)

Gedi do you even play the game or do you spend all your time creating skins lol
---
did you get this idea from LoL?
---
-100,000 gems

Can pull robots as well, for the Robo rumbles
---
He makes skins faster than SC
---
Second last. We were tied like a lot of waves
---
Not u *runs*
---
I guessed right on your Instagram, yippee!
---
Shh piper doesnt need a buff. It just needs skill to use. I'm sorry you're not skilled enough  to use her right.
---
The start of next month 
---
So, just Nita then?
---
Nothing is wrong with that picture 
---
You have 19 brawlers but only 3k?
---
That looks cute :3
---
I like the Jessie
---
I kinda like that

*Dynamike joins the server* 
---
You dont clear enemy brawlers first, you use your super to stun and damage the robot, build more super on the enemies, then super on the bot, and repeat. killing the enemy brawlers first will take away your ability to charge more super after using your first on the bot.
---
This is my cuesti√≥n

¬øWhen Carl arrived at brawl stars?

*sweating profusely*

How about just you not playing showdown and letting people who enjoy showdown, play it?

I have a friend at 1.3k trophies with a frank,Pam and a gene.

Concept is great. I just don‚Äôt know how it would work.

Penny all the WAY

My aunt put soap in my mouth
---
Randoms on a whole new level

Reminds me of TRON, and that automatically makes this my favrorite. Good job.
---
The idea is good, it‚Äòs just not that well executed, they should change how the meteors choose their target, right now it chases people around the map that can‚Äòt shoot back (eg darryl from a distance)
---
Doesn‚Äôt siege have this?
---
Lol true
---
Wut...
---
19 brawlers at 3k don‚Äôt feel bad. I was at 4K with no epic no legendary and one mythic.
---
solo showdown?
---
Y'aLL Be FoRGEtTiNg tHe oG

Ah, that's hot, that's hot!
---
except for that one that says azakamaru
---
I can tell that you based it off of Tron style stuff.
---
lol snowflakes
---
I see what you mean. the way OP portrayed this made it seem like you'd get extra boxes, Gold, power points ect. Cosmetics pass would be awesome
---
Mine is at 320 just got him after nerf
---
Chido
---
Why sadly? I think it is the right way. If matchmaking would be based on total trophies, people would keep 0 (or 30) throphies brawlers, the one they don't use to play, to match easier players.
---
Is your favorite brawler Crow?
---
Post this to r/Mortisgang for more upvotes

Dude and u have spike? I still don‚Äôt have a legendary and I‚Äôm at 4200 lol

Aw

Just *thinking* about it makes me scared
---
Ok this ham fisted attempt at a joke got a lot of negative feedback. Chill tf out
---
Sorry man. I don‚Äôt like that at all. It would be impossible to cross the midsection because of throwers and maybe a piper/Brock. Also getting to the safe would be a nightmare. All you would see here are draws.
---
BOOM BOX BABY 
---
RESPECT

Somebody already did this ...

But this is way better tbh
---
I‚Äôm 5k no piper
---
that poco is a complete moron, he almost fucked that up.
---
PAM GANG!!
---
The damage does it over time and if you hit three daggers, the poison still only does like 300. Honestly it just seems like leon is the better assassin in every situation. Personally I think his dagger poison should stack and that‚Äôd be all the buff he‚Äôs need
---
Idk why this only has 300 upvotes. One of the best, man. 
---
They do and I‚Äôm not saying I agree with that either. The only nice thing about that is they‚Äôll come back a year later when that event rolls back around, but for a battle pass it‚Äôs one and done
---
Someone make a brawler waluigi else the world will be un ballanced in *WAAAA*

Can someone make a leprechaun dynamike skin
