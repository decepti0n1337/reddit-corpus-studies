But if what you‚Äôre saying is true, at least be at ease knowing that I didn‚Äôt know it existed before I made it. I‚Äôve only been using reddit for about a month

Why's it r/onejob

That's kinda cool I guess

I‚Äôm pretty sure the person who posted it on r/clashofclans is the same person you posted it on r/brawlstars
---
exactly.
---
Luck not skill sorry
---
Yes
---
#bonk are you alright amigo?
---
This would destroy the game's economy
---
Quite literally nobody cares
---
Is it just me or did anyone else thought the Kid Icarus theme was playing in the background after he got Classic 8-bit?
---
Don‚Äôt worry you‚Äôre not alone...
---
Lol
---
Is having mortis at 600 while he is pwowr4 without playing solo is luck too?
---
Bruh I won easily
---
No prob
---
Still won
---
Already did
---
Same and it annoys the hell out of me
---
Bull moment
---
Smh.
---
ur joking? lmao

True

Shelly 3D model looks really cute (not in-game model)
---
The only buff I think she needs is a SLIGHT ammo recharge
---
Its funny cause they cant hit anything too
---
That pretty cool
---
Yeah it's pretty slow
---
You‚Äôve been using reddit for about a month? So 107 days is about a month now I guess
---
Frank is fast
---
Lol what even happened here
---
Congrats!
---
Cause there all dookey
---
I vs my teammates
---
Huh?
---
What...?
---
Look at em not even yrying to dodge walkimg into supers of course you won
---
His name is spin x lol
---
Shut the fuck up, retard. You don't even have 6k trash ass cunt.
---
It might need a buff but I would rather him not have one because he's a low skill brawler. Low skill brawlers shouldn't be as strong as higher skill brawlers. Bull is good in brawl ball and excellent in heist. Play him in the right modes and not like half the noobs that play him in every single showdown map no matter if the map is short or long range (same with primo)
---
Just cause u got 10th you dont have to let your anger out on reddit
---
I would encourage you to start calling environmental scientists and openly asking questions. Many of them love to talk about their work.
---
Demolition is more useful imo, you rarely use Dyna Jump at the perfect time, and Demolition can one bang a lot of brawlers
---
Yes and a yes from darrylgang I think
---
If played well though, Bibi is unkillable.
---
And now you‚Äôre complaining about people complaining about your complains
---
Because I have a reasonable complaint that for some reason I‚Äôm getting criticized for? Lol
---
Yeah, that's a popular Russian YouTuber Slidan
---
Ok dumbass
---
Notice how the comment has been edited. The original comment accused him of a flat out repost. Read my comment further down.
---
Yea but let‚Äôs be real, dyna jump is more fun
---
Tru
---
No i think it‚Äôs ridiculous how a team can get 3 out of the 4 siege bots and still lose on the last siege in two seconds. I think the siege bot has way to much power. There‚Äôs no strategy behind the game anymore. It‚Äôs simply dumb

Do you push at showdown or you are playing with team rooms. I had a lot of lose streaks with Bibi because some of my clubmates and friends reject my request and i was force to play with randoms.
---

this looks so funny

Could have just shortly explained it instead of being toxic about it.
---
Power 9 coiled snake is even more terrifying

no

I got leon over the summer then tara in the first week of school. Only need crow and mortis now
---
:"D
---
Best skin design ever
---
Why should he be banned? Seems like a team player
---
Well, that was pretty toxic of you. Beside, that's legit solo strategy even if a bit boring.
---
Theyll release it in a week or two, supercell doesn't want to release everything thing at once so people won't get bored and go all ChoosingBeggar in supercell's comment section
---
Bruh
---
I'm gonna go with skill
---
To me it looks more like the meteors were protecting you from mortis
---
Ok thank you for telling me
---
Also which is the better star power for mortis?
---
But it didn't affect your gameplay. The people who are actually lagging have serious lag where they can't play the game
---
Hol‚Äô up
---
Ikr same here
---
If that was the case then imagine you were at 5000 trophies and your teammate was at 5000 trophies. But your teammate just got mortis but you were piper at 500 trophies. It wouldn't work unless it did both and that would make it a longer queue time.
---
Oh go to the post I have a example link there if you want to see how bad it actually was
---
I'm down my friends are up :( I feel ya
---
Yeah I have a post we're I got leon

---
Donghoon look at the model itself. It‚Äôs nothing like beta crow. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs 300 gems. Because it uses a different model and new animations
---
For now

^oh ^no

Thanks. Always wondered what it looked like up close.

This is so good, I'd love to see more from you

I say the second is still better. For every time I see a dynamike at the beginning of a match using his jumping star power pointlessly, this point gets nailed further. Not to say it is useless, I merely think that it is either too difficult to master, or it sometimes backfires. To me, 4000 dmg straight up is just undeniably good
---
#**OH YES**
---
How much is it to hire shelly
---
yes, yes, i always understate my points
---
Similar to the space inside my head
---
You lose 25 trophies and get 40 star points is what I think it means
---
Its at 1:15 thank me later
---
I can play it fine
---
wait what ?? i just played for like 30 mins
---
I‚Äôm at 14K trophies and she literally everywhere in duo showdown and I‚Äôm not talking about 1 or two per game I‚Äôm talking 4 or 5 pipers per match on average. There are literally matches where I get teams of just pipers and that‚Äôs fucking insane because as long your in their range you‚Äôre literally a walking corpse.
---
You know how it feels when you‚Äôre surrounded between multiple teams everyone is shooting at you? Now imagine those teams are brawlers with bigger range than their phone screen and can 2 shot you. Not mention that you  have no way to counter her because 90% of brawlers are powerless against her thanks to the fact their range is nowhere near hers.
---
You know the meme about bull in a bush? Bull in a bush is counter able just by checking the bush before hand since he needs to get close to really screw you. Piper in  a bush on the other hand is literally uncounterable because she has most range therefore she just shoot you from a bush and kill you before you realize what even happened.
---
And now she has a star power that makes her have basically 5 bullets instead of 3, she can kill most brawlers in 2 bullets so now they gave her 5 so she can kill multiple people like nothing. 
---
It gets tiring being 2 shotted by someone you can‚Äôt even get close to.
---
Stop ‚úã
---
Sorry noob
---
Same I‚Äôm east coast
---
I get a maintenance break whenever I try to get on
---
Best*?
---
Both Luck (Because the Mortis could have killed you if he aimed properly) and Skill (Because you two killed the Bo at an unfair Powercubes advantage). Coach Cory rating meter: 8.5/10

I've been hearing about it, I hope it gets fixed asap
---
I am android beta player and don't have 13:14. The fake time doesn't matter, the time you can do by yourself and your team matters.
---
like movie misery..
---
I‚Äôm east too maybe it‚Äôs just a east coast thing
---
Ye, some ppl are having issues like me. All my friends can pmay except me
---
Reddit or the game?
---
 for me no maintenance break. i think its only for certian regions
---
Dude what
---
Your will to live should be enough
---
That sub is useless, trust me
---
i didnt have any maintenance
---
I would love to see those new ideas in the game
---
I see, a man of culture as well
---
Ive never seen something so dumb in awhile
---
I prefer default shelly because she is the least used shelly skin.
---
Nope, my friends are able to play
---
Bro this is e p I c

I'm having the same issue. Hoping something gets figured out.

Oh well I'll just hide under my bed

Now expect you're a big brawler playing Crow or other brawlers which can fly across the maze
---
Same from Argentina.

Fair trade. You placed 2nd

Seriously right? This guy is the reason your team fell apart

I am 2 trophies away for my 800 trophies 8-bit

No it is Called center charge

Im glad its gone

Nice art i want more like this

Dynamike is a King of the Spin

Time to head over to rush wars

No its rank 1 u can see its 26 -_-
---
Thanks I went to Twitter already so yeah
---
It does not overheat you idiot, game crashes. You look illiterate to me can't even read simple english.
---
Please be Shark Leon... I really want him, I have 99 gems. Supercell, take my money!
---
mom says its my turn on thousand lakes
---
Maybe its shark leon
---
Most likely something to make the game better or at least more stable which both is their job. So be patient and let em do their job
---
I Was Being Realistic Btw.Everyone knows he is broken af.
---
You rock :)
---
Happens to me always with Rico!
---
_[visible confusion]_
---
Yay!
---
Are you in NA? I have a 750 Rosa and poco if you want to team up
---
you mean lunar new year?
---
There was an idea similar to this, 7.4/10
---
Nice existing  not such a good idea
---
thats what im thinking of whoops
---
Very yes
---
very good Yde
---
that face actually looks like Thomas the tank engine
---
No, they don't.
---
Source: I have more than 9K trophies
---
an actual maintenance break
---
Maybe he was thinking that you would lose anyway. But he is totally a trash. Supercell needs to make an invisible wall alongside the net that perevent teammates to walk the ball in.
---
People are probably mad It's a perm slot now?
---
When media says videogames cause violence
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure the mortis shot it in the goal only because he had it with the shelly being bAd
---
He's trying to charge his super. This used to be pretty common with teaming but thankfully there's less teaming now and therefore less of this garbage.
---
Saw you on Twitter, came here, and you're here too, nice :P
---
I‚Äôm at 15k trophies. Multiple Brawler‚Äôs above 750. What I said is true. They understand better than players under 500 do
---
8-bit is super op tho, all you need is a team of good people and pushing him is easy.
---
:)
---
bruh xD
---
Primo is the BEST ;&gt;
---
Jeszcze Polska nie zginƒô≈Ça...
---
no i don‚Äôt think that would be a good addition because as annoying as it is, teammates accidentally walking into the goal is fair. but good idea tho
---
I have no trouble connecting, are you all on android or iOS
---
They didn't fix every thing in the last maitace break
---
I am romanian and i don't speak good english , but is cost 49 gems for the.....you know !
---
Oh, you're talking about brawlers 750+ trophies,not player profiles..

Actually amazing keep up this good work bro

Big yikes

Lol meals are prepared as slow as 8bit walks
---
Suppose you're right, I guess I'm just used to solo queuing which usually doesn't make for good teams
---
Even worse: You play as 8-Bit
---
Then your reposting your own meme
---
No
---
As far I understand, no matter where you are in the range given, you get reset to a specific number. 
---
If you're 551 or 599 you still go to 525 and get 70 star points.
---
Leo Nita
---
You idiot, spikes is a pun so its in all caps
---
What the hell is wrong with you asshole??? Op is just asking a question
---
Passing to Auto Aim heavy brawlers is very risky imo Especially Randoms where they aren't coordinated well
---
Rockwall brawl
---
Because i dont have Phoenix crow
---
Where did you get 70 star points from?
---
No one cares about your real time anyways. It‚Äôs not about how far you got legit, and having the 13:14 timer shows more than just being a beta players; it‚Äôs kind of nice to have something that new players don‚Äôt, like an exclusive. Not only that; more tokens - it was an exploit so exploit it lol, milk it - there are no consequences. I don‚Äôt get your ‚Äúmoral‚Äù approach to it I mean it doesn‚Äôt mean much but oh well
---
But i just got on feast or famine
---
Press F to pay respects
---
It's the least they can do. But players can throw a game in a lot of ways if they want. They can just pass the ball to opponent team and stand aside and do nothing.

Right here man

I love it

They probably working on that Android crash issue.

The 8-bit could of easily stopped that by not teaming up. The game recognises if you do this and punishes you accordingly.
---
My favourite thing on this pic is BARLEY
---
R/whooosh
---
He probably was pissed off of a mortis last battle. Generally you fight hard to kill an opponent and you succeed to kill him and proceed to lick your wounds. But as a mortis being mortis and a try hard opportunist, he killed him.
---
So he swore to kill a mortis next game.

It's a good map

I've seen this before but it was a dynamike instead of a barley and a powercube instead of a gem, idk why you would put a gem there :p

Yes they were supposed to

I see three bad randoms in that team. Passing the ball to the Shelly next to your own goal wasn't a good move, but the worst was wasting two ammo in blaming them after after the kick off.

More shares = more likely to pinpoint the problem.

bruh spick sounds like spike and tick

I thought it works in solos

from what i've observed he was the brawler to reach rank 35 first

what body swapping feels like

World record is 14 lol idk how they did that

Are you kidding me?Really?
---
...dies...
---
I used the maintenance break to destroy the maintenance break.

Did you guys win tho
---
I think everyone does this. I spin if i'm trapped but then just run away. And i kill the other guy later on. I don't do this if i'm already high enough to earn trophies tho
---
Nope they just wasted their shots on shooting at each other
---
I think we all know where this is going
---
The box opened itself when u left
---
I saw someone make it in 18 seconds. Btw my best is 22sec
---
Btw this crashing thing is a bit annoying
---
Did you win that game
---
Thanks but it's still makes me feel sad because i got nothing even not a star power or 1 gem to buy key doubler
---
Yes it is
---
:(
---
I think that the next brawler will be a mythic and at the end of the year we will get a legendary. The. We have in total 30 brawlers :)
---
Best player in the world
---
I had that glitch too where we all voted to play again but our poco was in the other team the next match
---
Nope, darryl had 7.2 k hp so no matter if he got the power cube he would still die in 8 ticks. He survived because of his star power which gives him 25% shield

Ha helarios love cheese nachos with jalapenos sinor. See ya.

Well I am at 15,5k and I dont need to many megaboxes I think it would be better a skin or something

Nah I don‚Äôt think Supercell would give a mythic brawler that easily
---
no problem, tell your friends if they have reddit!
---
Cool, but I think it gets rid of the whole point of 8-bit, I mean he‚Äôs an arcade machine
---
Pat on the back. so the worst one
---
If the community's mature enough, everyone will disagree. Most of people here are teenages without jobs, so that's what they're thinking. It's the reason why this post has a huge amount of upvotes. People think that reaching a milestone such as lvl 100/200 should be rewarding

Damn, that's tuff

Yeah. 5.5k trophees. They are rare tho but id rather not have any 7 year olds in my team

The turtle head seems a bit much. Maybe do what Nita does and put little "X"s over the eyes to make it look a bit more normal. Also, I feel that the turtles on the weapons should have blue shells to complete the look. Otherwise, great job! This would be super cool as a real skin

The same problem happens on powerful phone!

I have a Snapdragon 820 and i used to play at rock solid 60fps with no framedrop or whatsoever...
---
Ya but its probably kinda hard
---
But what that guy is saying is that once you get all star powers it is easy to get coins. I reached this point (albeit with less coins), so i just save my boxes. If i ever need the 2000 coins it takes for a new star power in the shop, i can just open around 17-20 boxes and achieve that. I had 200 boxes when Beemo (8-bit) released and hes already level 10, and i still have over 100 boxes left.
---
r/shottybrawlstars

Nice
---
What's the problem here?
---
Lets be honest here, people who haven't mastered Dyna jump will obviously use demolition coz it's just throwing down the super, whereas if dyna jump is mastered you'll have much more advantages

Don‚Äôt you see the box?

Oh yeah, i completely forgot about that Au. I'll probably do the comic first before the game.

Credit for Piper goes to u/Brawlstars
---
Well you just gotta run and hope 2 other people die because of shelly countering Leon and crow countering shelly
---
Well I get my first legy at 6k...but good luck I hope you get it much time before!!
---
I upvoted! Nice drawing man!
---
NO EMOJIS
---
are the random skulls neccesary
---
Same I have 1 power 10 and 1 power 9 every other brawler is between 2 and 6 with 1 7 people who complain about the trophy system are just p2win or bad at the game so need a maxed account to push
---
Ik but I don‚Äôt put on sounds often lol
---
Ty üíü
---
It isn't bad
---
well he has rank 35 spike and bibi, also
---
Crow can jump on me and shelly because we are on 1 shot OK OK STUPITTTTTTüñïüñïüñïüñïüñïüñï
---
&gt;Notice how I used barley instead of dy
---
yup
---
You dumby dumb. Why you using emojis?
---
Well you shouldn‚Äôt have tried to fight Leon at the start
---
First of all no.  I got the idea of a funnier meme from someone but I made it by myself.  Also, no emojis.  Just a heads up, you will be burned alive in all subs for doing this
---
leon try to fight with me at the start you STUPITTTT SHITTTTTüñïüñïüñïüñïüñï

You should have supered away from him

I know, I wanted to give her a short hairstyle.

Tick is so cute,very nice skin idea :-D!!
---
Well that's your decision to get it. They dont force you to get it
---
I asked a question,but i said it like I didn't understand the joke,even though there was no joke involved(I think)So somebody wooooshed me.I argued that I got the joke but it didn't make sense(if joke is even involved),and other people came and said you got wooooshed bro,just take it like a champ

He AlSo Has HiV

Could be, just need the damage to like 850 round there and add the 4th attack

Guys I'm literally shaking

thanks, "PIZZA"\_L0VER  :-)

That looks like he‚Äôs dropping trophies. I don‚Äôt know why though, hunting party was last week
---
Yup, 12k without a legendary haha

Jk bruh

Wanna see an inflated Darryl?

Can I have a bomb pizza pls
---
I mean a new legendary brawler but only can unlock in trophy road
---
Why are you reporting things that is not your business?
---
*Vietnam flashbacks...*
---
You know that a brawler should have at least 1 weakness and 8-Bit has high damage,high health,decent reload speed and pretty much every other catagory
---
Um. This is AMAZING.... but.....
---
Pizza Spike would be an epic skin. He throws a pizza and it splits into 6 slices.... Just saying. And his AOE super could be a pizza oven or something like that.
---
"CRAL"

I think he was asking why the tick is aiming a shelly shot
---
Moji prijatelji ni neigraju brawl stars
---
Ok man chill ü§∑ü§∑ how much trophies are you.leon is strong I know I have leon power 10 and 605 trophies and he is my favourite brawler.
---
He was finna shook
---
People had him at 1k the day he was released so I‚Äôm not surprised someone has him rank 35 already
---
Pizza time stops
---
Amazing! I love it.
---
Bruh moment
---
Wait,I am doing something
---
He hasn‚Äôt been released yet.
---
Wise man say, ‚ÄòForgiveness is divine, but never pay full price for pizza.‚Äô
---
Leon is op tho :/
---
Cuz u thought nothing is wrong here
---
Yes legendary percentages are too low. I mean like really? People with 14,000+ trophies and still no legendaries? They should definately increase the chances. Oh and also, just because you were lucky enough to get a legendary it doesn‚Äôt mean the system isn‚Äôt broken. This favors pay to win so much as it‚Äôs almost impossible to get a legendary as a f2p
---
Yes...but as a starpower and the condition that he has his super charged i think this idea is pretty nice...but i understand what u mean...i remember the rosa times XD
---
Dynamike why?
---
Got the same for bo soo
---
I knew it! Tick is an undercover Shelly
---
How the hell he couldn't find the difference between 420 and 409 he's even worse than I thought, can't read numbers
---
Nope
---
Yeah man, even if we try to help them they won't understand, so let them be on their own way
---
That shit happend to me the other day and its like wtf
---
No he is not
---
Ah yes
---
I can still auto aim
---
Ok, thats good enough
---
I do not believe you
---
Fake because that would be an average of 720 trophies per brawler
---
You should post this on r/mortisgang 
---
Also nice username
---
I know i'v watched some of them and I know that's what he says all the time but why?
---
Okay,if you're wanting too add that speed buff,you should probably make it a 5%-15%
---
Crow is balanced af
---
Fun fact: At the end of a match dragon knight Jessie doesn't close her eyes and it says custom animation
---
Heist and Bounty are also amazing too. Brawl Ball is literally my least favorite mode :(
---
I'm at 15k and you thought wrong
---
Bro I love the details u put into this keep up the good work
---
Have you played this map at all? Bunch of teaming and all it is is a bunch of pipers who chase everyone else around the edge the whole game. Terrible map, they need less of these maps and more diverse ones, too many long range ones like this
---
Its ya boi gedi-kor back at it again at crispy creams
---
Don't make this get lost in new!! I am over 10k and no legendaries
---
Dont worry, you will get it soon :)
---
im doin this w crow lol but hes only lvl 3
---
sdedn

–¢–∏ —Ö–æ—Ç—å –ø–µ—Ä–µ–≤–µ–ª

Is similar to Delivery pizza Sivir
---
Is the same Splash art ......in Brawl universe
---
Nah... Ur good bro
---
Ce scrims urat ai...
---
i also loved it specially bounty with energy drink
---
Maybe in the week they could use the fifth panel for modified SD but i don‚Äôt think that Supercell will add it tbh
---
awesome but name should change
---
Feelin cool, might blow the gun later
---
For people who don't have friends 24/7 on the game like me, it's the best mode. I honestly despise playing 3v3 and only do it when there's star tokens. I hate randoms.

Was at 400 trophies as well as my other teammate but my other teammate was a 0 trophy power level 1 Nita
---
Maybe not that good of a reward maybe some starpoints
---
Or a big box
---
But every once in a while you might get a mega box
---
That's nice. Congrats on 16k i guess.
---
Lol i mare the same meme xD
---
Damn, Brawl Stars has changed so much since i last played!
---
YES PLEASE
---
Same idea, different times. Wasn‚Äôt stolen from each other üôÉ

Maybe some people do because why would there be a thing like r/lootstars ? Maybe you don‚Äôt care about it but do you have to complain when you don‚Äôt actually care? Just skip it.

---
Sorry pincake üö´is boomerang sorry
---
Uhhhhhhhhh
---
Bruce sucks A LOT
---
its a an E+10/T rated game tho
---
Yeah dude the trophy changes are such a big thing. Plus 1 trophy in 3v3 and plus 2 in showdown. Game changing.
---
Oh ok
---
They should release a trophy road Brawler at 10k with a medium skill cap, so us dedicated players can show off.
---
But who tf plays showdown up to 20k
---
CREEPER?
---
Without your edit, I would have appreciated your silver.
---
No the account has been deleted not the post...
---
Ok, thanks for showing it to me, I wonder how rico looks like, i wanted to get him.
---
Guess ill remove it
---
Band-aid shelly

Oh ok haha

Oh I didn't think of that haha
---

Np

No it's not

And way too many heavyweights

I‚Äôve already completed the trophy road. Can‚Äôt wait to push for... nothing at all

[deleted]
---
absolutely incredible job! love it every time you post Gedi!
---
I saw rico too but it was with his old ricochet model ,that one actually had joints but it was in a pack with a crossed eyed Jessie and skinny looking Frank and Primo
---
Yeah because of teaming, put competitively, gem grab is the most loved game mode
---
I found the same bad random twice in a row
---
Maybe he could launch over obstacles
---
Edit: really similar to piper‚Äôs now that I think about it
---
Nojs
---
says you with the auto aim
---
Bro chill
---
Now im getting a weird theroy that jessie's dog was a living dog but died somehow, so she rebuilt it.
---
Much cleaner
---
WHO SAYS BROCK ROCKET ITS BROCKET YA NOOB.
---
(no offense just wanted to say that üòÇ)
---
Stop shaking the cam
---
At least your randoms move, mine are all blet
---
It's just another troll account who wants to have -99 karma and get to r/shittybrawlstars
---
I liked Heist :(
---
Yeah but the piper could have gonna away.. nope... just just auto aimed in the wrong moment :/
---
Sorry I get this feeling to correct and stuff and no I don't have Mortis yet.But if I had Mortis he would be my main.
---
Supercell will make you pay 30 gems for each song change lol
---
Its ok
---
*But at least your randoms left the spawn*
---
Bean lightning
---
Thanks
---
In what area is a buff needed?
---
BUT WE COULD HAVE WON.. at least we lose with dignity.. not like this
---
I finally got piper done!  Please check out my profile
---
Lmao yes you do. I‚Äôll prob 1v1 you and beat you
---
I had that too except I was at 500 trophies with a 0 trophie 8 bit
---
Don‚Äôt know not my job to I just know he needs one
---
Killing a crow that follows you is so satisfying, I never feel any emotion when killing brawlers other than crows or if they are teaming
---
 this is a broken skin
---
O yea
---
Yeah they blow up like. A real arrow
---
IDK why but bull and naked Jessie are uncomfortable for my
---
 I do not call that
---
All of them and i am f2p at 14k
---
IS HERE!!!!!!
---
Well bush/bull and Shelly are able to one shot when at close range. Shelly more so with her ult. But it‚Äôs pretty balanced. The auto-aim button will be there cuz this game geared towards children as well as adults. Something you have to accept and adapt to. Good luck. I‚Äôm sure many would love an acct with bibi and spike.
---
Edit: I meant to write bull and wrote bush instead. Honest mistake lol
---
I have a small question for you. Why do fighters fall out a little dishonest? Suppose people on very small cups drop legendary bravlers and there is a video that proves this, and people with a lot of trophies do not drop even mythical fighters? Here I have 7232 trophies and I just can‚Äôt find the piper and bibi how is it? but on August 8, 2019, a raven falls out of an ordinary chest! Please make it so that fighters are less likely to get out a little faster üôèüíì.
---
Thank you for understanding !
---
P.S # 2C8V8Y9CY: –°–´–ï–ù–î–£–ö ! üòâ

Right lol sorry

r/deadsubs
---
I like how everyone instantly leaves
---
Barley has the pie, dynamike has the jalapenos they cant leave my mans tic out here without a food skin
---
r/usernamechecksout
---
What do you mean? Brock would have died too, he has way too low hp.
---
Lol I was wondering about that. I thought that Bush was the name in some other countries or something.
---
oh ok nice I‚Äôm at 10k only have leon lol
---
I had a random at 500 trophies. They were Nita and the bear was better then they were...
---
To much for my brain ,thanks for the effort tho xdd
---
Witam ;)
---
Why so many arrows
---
Mortis already heals 1400 HP with his star power
---
Franks power grab already lasts 12 seconds
---
Shelly‚Äôs lasts 3 seconds
---
Bo‚Äôs does not need a buff
---
Gene‚Äôs little pellets already do extra damage with the star power
---
Rosa‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt need that much of a buff
---
Speed  bruh
---
Ok I'm listening
---
it already got nerfed
---
*peta
---
#But he has lower hp than 8-Bit, it would have been the same result
---
*Dab-bingly handsome*
---
(downvote me to oblivion)
---
#SMACK ATTACK
---
Spike is a pizza runner
---
yes
---
There's no way to prove it
---
(start)
---
Well, actually, this is not true, because in the first megabox the content is default for all players, and it only contains some shelly points and some coins, so 150 gold coins are better than some few power points for shelly and 10 or 20 coins
---
Whoops
---
So why do you call him dumb when you just said, that you don't know what would have happened.
---
Mam pytanie czy chcia≈Çby≈õ mo≈ºe ze mnƒÖ zagraƒá bo szukam jakich≈õ dobrych ludzi do gry?
---
Mam 7150 puszek.
---
Hmm he is good but those 8-bits are really annoying when ur facing them as crow
---
G
---
Epic! Love the idea, hope it gets implemented into the game!
---
At 10k with no legendaries
---
Cute
---
Yes it is easier, but getting a legendary at 15k makes it harder to upgrade in my opinion, also I don't think a legendary at 15k is that rewarding since people would expect better rewards on the way to 15k
---
Thank u : )
---
can yu lik mi ski
---
It wasn't you said so because you are a piper main and also brainwashed youtubers shut up
---
OMG nice re,modeal !!!! You aur maze ing :D
---
No problem, you deserve it!
---
That's her name in the french version
---
Welcome to my world you can find me in shitty brawl stars
---
I honestly fee like they don‚Äôt care. This has been raised by so many people and I haven‚Äôt seen anyone from supercell acknowledging this is an issue.
---
Also, I am at 15k if I am matched with people that are 10k trophies below me, I don‚Äôt understand why I am never matched with people that are with 10k range above me.
---
You completely misunderstood my point. I'm saying that every brawler not all rounded have a weak point. Primo being his range, 8bit being his speed.
---
Maybe he is unbalanced in the end. On my part I have no problem. On the contrary, I'm really happy to see a 8bit in showdown. it's free power ups for me.
---
HE'S SHADOWBANNED
---
*crab rave starts playin in the back*
---
it was mad but me
---
Indeed
---
Get good
---
BRUH
---
## bruh üíØü§£ü§£ü§°ü§°
---
This is good
---
I like this
---
ok
---
how should they buff shelly by buffing her HP or her main attack or reworking the range
---
18.3K, 0.24 percentage. Free to play. Been playing the game for over 2 years
---
They won't do anything if it gets lost in New.  They'd remove it if it got to hot.
---
Did u get inspiration from the swashbuckler imp from gw2? Because it looks a lot like it.
---
u/antipoopooheadBS here nerd reposter
---
Oh, I wasnt criticizing your point, speed is definitely a VITAL part of the game. It's just that for 8-bit it's not enough imo. 8-bit is really only easy to kill of your piper or a thrower right now.
---
00:41 guys
---
+3 and -13 if your playing solos past 1200 trophies
---
This needs to be fixed
---
You must have trouble getting legendaries or you had a bad matchup with randoms
---
showdown in rotation?? that would cause an uproar in the community
---
Rosa: I'm not paying for this
---
ME trying to do 8 bit voice: WELL DONE
---
13 k is a good idea ‚Ä¶ supercell pls make it possible I don‚Äôt have any mythic and legendaries and I‚Äôm at 13 k ( before trophy update )
---
dude,i'm sha....ring this to my friend and he love it
---
seriously
---
Yeah thats logical, thats how i maxed my leon and crow, but he's taljing about him not using bibi at all when she's his only maxed brawler
---
Good comeback, those guys deserved it
---
sleeping with the fishes
---
That's how Brawl Stars works
---
Eh, Idk, wouldn't this just make them another trophy road brawler but just harder to get?
---
i love that map
---
Nah im in much better humor now, you know, its only a rage moment. My luck with gettinf brawlers is good... Acceptable.
---
Also i expeced those "git good" or "fucking noob" comments to come but i just got one of those :(
---
You're an idiot. And a liar.
---
Soory i cant find that.
---
I dont no why!
---
probably re-working the range, regardless of a range buff, her damage at range will always be bad, so i think that needs a change, idk how they would increase damage at range while preserving her close range damage though
---
9k trophies 4 brawlers leveled up to 20 thanks for the advice :)
---
Pretty much
---
17k. 2 leg, 0,0336
---
They'll probably never gonna fix teaming
---
What brawler(s) do you hate playing against while using Carl?
---
Tips for countering them?
---
Boooooo!
---
Swap gem grab and bounty
---
Pizza time
---
it's hard to balance her though cause she is either OP or useless no in between
---
She's too thicc to fit in the image, btw i'm reporting you
---
I would love By the way to taste a Legendary Burger üçî must have some Spiky taste like a Crow or a Cameleon
---
Do you want r/shittybrawlstars ? If you want i post it there, if you dont want... i will post it anyway.
---
when a kids game can be the most fucked up sub
---
Dinamike in this map is level god of the gods
---
I‚Äôm with you, brawlball is easily my least favorite mode. Close behind it is siege but I at least sometimes have a good time playing siege. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever enjoyed brawlball even with a good team.
---
I got my first epic at 5k so u ok
---
Imma be honest that looks like one of the female inklings from splatoon 2
---
I chatted with him, he only used her in big game and he didn‚Äôt pay nothing, just hard work!
---
It used to. Now it doesn‚Äôt take long at all with the new reward trophy system
---
I agree with this post i hate bush camping bulls and shellys man im using Bibi as my main brawlee and i dont like playing bush camping i like agro playing bush camping is a boring strategy
---
What would you get if you reach it and already have every brawler
---
Why r u being mean? :(
---
I think it should be removed just in case lol
---
I just said i post it there..
---
The offers appear every end of season
---
It is, i really wish supercell adds a few maps without any bushes
---
0.19, have all 3
---
Lol i had leon at 800 trophies and now i'm at 11k only missing crow and spike
---
Yeah my mom told my this story
---
Supercell likes teaming
---
This is so cute
---
Thank you!!!
---
yeah ikr, also what‚Äôs up frank?
---
So you want to get teammate that take the ball and score at you?yestersay i got a poco in gemgrab who just go and sit in the corner the whole game
---
Damn Gedi-KOR, back at it again with the awesome skin concept
---
Speedy boi
---
Thicc mama
---
No, people will abuse this so much. Oh you get a bad random REPORTED
---
Maybe
---
You have to consider the fact that legendaries are incredibly rare in this game and are super easy to get in clash royale.
---
A legendary in brawl stars is worth more than a legendary in clash royale so they have to be treated as such.
---
What if you..
---
Wanted to win...
---
But Shelly said :
---
_band-aid_
---
I‚Äôm sorry I don‚Äôt speak minecraft enchantment table
---
You know you're fucked up, when even the replay lags

Wtf is this shitpost

Why do you even care? You haven't put any of his skin ideas in the game yet.

Lop :))))

Big betray xD

The old models sucked get over it shitposter

It's like the botw 2 zelda

i miss the golden week music, i got kinda sick of the mecha music
---
You love too see it
---
ooF
---
Lol you finded an italian youtuber friend, the guy with ‚Ä¢F‚Ä¢
---
Like if u want pizza tick
---
Imagine if you lost...
---
Brock x piper they have something together with ears
---
Must be one of popohead's mini account
---
I litterally had my pizza delivered to me the second this came up
---
This is so old that level 10 were still at 300 trophies
---
Do you have frank
---
Bruh, it didnt need a nerf, stleast not one as hard as that. Be happy it got nerfed to the ground instead of asking for another nerf to make it useless.
---
***exactly why we need a shelly nerf***
---
STOP TEAMING!!!
---
My flex is: Spike on saturday and Crow today. I'm happy asf
---
Looks like shit. But keep going you‚Äôll get better
---
I smell F L E X I N G
---
what if one accidentally clicks on it or doesn't think about the new legendary brawler thing and unlocks it?
---
It's bc Matchmaking isn't easy to fix.
---
6000 trophies, that's what all of my teammates have in trophie count!
---
I'm soo hungry can you enter the oven 
---
Spike gang
---
What if they have all the legendary brawlers?
---
I don‚Äôt know him but at least he had eagle vision!
---
I dont get it:\
---
Yeah i know its like 7 months ago
---
It doesn't take long at all, maybe a month if you're active?
---
Its like snake prariy for guest good concept maybe add more interesting areas
---
The black bars mean you have an iPhone X or Samsung s 9 or better
---
That‚Äôs fire
---
Yeah, it's kinda our thing
---
Shame.
---
Guys im shaking
---
I do the best out of my team sometimes and then we lose and I get sad I don‚Äôt even get anything similar to star player
---
I find that sometimes you actually want to leave, but you feel kinda bad, especially if you‚Äôre winning and don‚Äôt want to mess it up, but then after a loss you use it as kinda a excuse of, ‚Äúwelp, bye!‚Äù.
---
Oooooo lol i noticed it,
---
Isnt it a disadvantage tho?
---
Oof one time i did a match and it was 2 seconds left in bounty and i accidentally  pressed home and i came back and won but got no trophys i was hella pissed because i was about to get to 9k
---
That was before the trophy adjustment. Probably way more now.
---
Guys im shaking again...
---
Touching!! Wtf(jk but still)
---
That's a nice shopping cart
---
My luckiest 2 days l got spike and gene and carl
---
Wow I didn‚Äôt even recall if there were bars I had to check it and yep haha
---
Now this makes me shake not the remodel
---
I think its stolen
---
I
---
shellys who use their super for long range damage are automatically inbred
---
Who else read it in their mind as a cute voice and then a deep dark voice lol
---
Go to the store, select on any box, then click the (i) on the top left to check your chances of a new character. This won't help get a new character but it's good to know your luck
---
you should have drawn BALOONEY
---
I see Spike, too!
---
Thats me. It gets boring having to play the same brawler with the same team in the same mode. So if you lose, its an opening
---
Your one of the reasons i left rbrawlstars
---
I prefer Medical use. Keeps you alive
---
Useful if your math skill is 0
---
Fun fact: Bibis french name is Billie
---
Meteors and bo traps: I'm about to end this man's whole career
---
Yes is good, but Snappy makes Piper so much better

Same, and I was hoping that would be the case. Unfortunate indeed. Still better than anything we got b4.

Bruh he has the void in his back

Lol, when I found out my heart sunk because I was under the denotation that we could be as much as our currency allows.

If you dont get mythics or legendaries at low trophies you will never have them.

A must!

10k is pretty easy to get to know. With the trophy system being changed people can easily get that many trophies. Itll take time yes but it‚Äôs still not as hard as it used to be.

Someone should make a lego tick. So if brawlers step on his legos, they take damage.

Nah chief, it‚Äôs all good! I love constructive criticism, for it improves my work for the better! Btw, I had stage 4 cancer in the 6th grade, your criticism is nothing compared to that crud. Cheers mate!
