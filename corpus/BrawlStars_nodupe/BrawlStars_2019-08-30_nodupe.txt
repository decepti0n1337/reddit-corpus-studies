I unlocked gene today and I was the only person not using 8-bit in showdown
---
I have 0.1344 and not a single legendary...why am I in this ‚Äúppl not getting legendarys at 15k‚Äù stuff??
---
Yeah but it wasn't introduced in the future. It comes out in the future. (Although at the time of posting this it came out in the past)
---
As a fellow member of the Nova esports (Light). You deserve a full shoutout and and your name on some sort of hall of fame. Nice job!
---
No one is gonna mention that one of the 8-Bits attack another 8-Bit?
---
Wtf
---
Worth mentioning that Spike SP was "kind of" leaked by supercell themselves in its Twitter account before removing the video where stated that
---
8-Bit is such a fun brawler, from visual design to sound design, and the particle effects 8-Bit is just an awesome addition to brawlstars and I'm excited to keep playing him. I made this comic today just as a fun idea to how he must have joined the game.

Whoa how do you have 8-bit's star power already?

I honestly despise brawl ball, I wouldn‚Äôt object to it being a ticketed event honestly. There wasn‚Äôt anything wrong with the heist/bounty system imo.
---
You are not the only one bounty is my favourite gamemode, and brawl ball is my least favourite.

It's a fucking juke, it's supposed tu be funny

Honestly, my main beef with brawl ball is that my teammates play against me more often than not
---
Dont worry my reloads fast....
---
canned anger
---
Yeah

So no one ever plays with me when im 8 bit

You need to have at some point a brawler at 700 or above and 650 ain‚Äôt 700, nothing wrong with the game.
---
Same, I love Bounty. It's one of the most interesting gamemodes and one that practically every brawler can excel at. I also liked Heist too. But now I'll have to wait for *Hell*, I mean, *Siege* to play it.
---
Its a part of the game so we should keep its

If you take a look on it closely you see it isn't just a color change. You see little pattern designs added in her mask and pants, and gold ornaments in her dress.

Well. I tried

Oh ok

this is why i don't sort by new
---
Brain dead piper then
---
All they had to do was put siege in with gem grab.
---
at least u have the 'friends'. I hate the bands/guilds in brawl stars, none is nice u know. They're that kind that says 'get out of this team, noob' when you don't CARRY the team. (both have most likely more trophs(15k+) than me but play worse). 
---
And every match i play with randoms i'm asking myself like "how did that (example) shelly get to 800 trophs, he's completely skill&amp;brainless).
---
Bounty is the only map that largely allows you to play your best brawler and win.
---
Showdown has long since been ruined by teaming, and those who don‚Äôt team just camp or run away all game by design. Bounty forces combat and rewards skill. Other game modes are too dependent on team comp, and I play solo.
---
I did not work for me :/
---
YING
---
Bruhh
---
Look on the bright side, the other 25 brawlers you have are all really cool and fun to play, Leon, spike, and crow are nice but if you ask me they don‚Äôt hold a candle to Rico, Mortis, Tara, and Piper. 
---
Easily the 4 most fun brawlers in the game.
---
Thanks I needed to hate myself more than usual today
---
What modes did you grind on? Secondary question do you still think Mortis is good in brawl ball?
---
Oh, and not to mention, they remove memes with Obama on it for "being political"
---
IT HAS *ABS*
---
I appreciate you
---
Just max them to rank 35 lol.
---
Now it‚Äôs Piper‚Äôs time to shine
---
Why would she go through customs when she can use it to fly
---
That‚Äôs 6-7 star tokens in a day, just a tad broken in my eyes.
---
What...?
---
I credited the artist in a comment
---
Yes I‚Äôm aware that‚Äôs not the best way
---
Yes I know that makes me a bad person
---
Yes I know I‚Äôm awful
---
I don‚Äôt need everyone on the sub to tell me that

Tell me your legendary drop rate

they probably removed it so colt can't play

Oh yeah I didn‚Äôt think of that

I just unlocked Leon this morning so very relatable

In the comments though. The title could've been the least he could've done because most people won't see his comment. Especially considering how he never asked Chrono if he could use it in the first place.

Sorry, reddit bugged
---
PIPER PEACH
---
Hey what exactly is the amount a brawler is reset to after a season? Is only after 500 like before? Is it only after a new number? Is it half your trophies like before or something new?
---
You know 2000 hp is still heals more than poco
---
:|   That moment when all you wanted to do was show off that it looked like a movie poster with the bottom text and people assume you‚Äôre stealing for your own benefit, I just want y‚Äôall to have good times is that too much to ask
---
Evolution, must of past me by
---
Star power idea for 8-bit
---
Insert coin: 8-bit heals 350 health everytime he is hit Penny's coins.
---
Band - Aid = auto poco and it 80% that it heals you in right moment
---
On Reddit yeah it sucks. I didn‚Äôt mean the text as mean I‚Äôm just saying you got your mistake.
---
How else would they add new ranks? They needed a way to rework star points.
---
More evidence is that one of his death voice lines is ‚ÄúYou lose!‚Äù
---
Fun bit of trivia, that voice line is ripped from Primo and edited to sound more robotic, sort of like what the mecha/robo skins did.
---

I bought pink piper. One of my club mates bought it though.

Or just add another game mode slot for 2 to share

And then there's heist and siege, where people forget about the damage raining upon them to get to the heist/bolts.
---
Agreed.

Woah

1k upvotes. i hate coloring

Same. I expect some very heavy compensation.

As every other subreddit

Check playstore there is an optional update.

I think iv uninstalled and updated like 20 times already and I still have the same problem

what did you do to make it stop cause it keeps happening to me
---
You really got pissed off right. So you started stalking me. Shows what kind of person you are
---
Where's the goatee? Now that's a question
---
Its a recolor and shouldnt be even counted as a skin
---
Then, people would get even angrier. Showdown is the most favorite mode.

I‚Äôve seen pros organize team, and told supercell help and support with substantial evidence, and I was told that it wasn‚Äôt true.

Why did you nerf darryl why? He never did anything wrong hes now the worst character to play with and now I can't use him properly
---
Cause I chose to play by the rules. If I wanted to play co-op I would rather play Duo.
---
Why would people get angry with another game slot for events? Do you know what I am saying? There are 4 game slots, 5 when the tickets event comes out.
---
I do.
---
same
---
&gt; Piper, for example, is hardly seen outside of Bounty and Siege.
---
I agree with most of your points, except this, Piper is great in gem grab
---
If I had never visited Rule34 I ensure you I wouldn't have a clue of what it is, much less how it is called.
---
Ok but ask me first if I did.
---
I guess supercell just didnt add thing to it as it doesnt have model and texture too.
---
Yes! That exact same thing happened to me, I was so confused and I googled the error message only to find no real solution. So I just logged out of my Apple ID and then logged back in and it fixed it! 
---
Also, when I was in this weird glitch, when I looked up ‚Äúrush wars‚Äù in the App Store it showed up so that was weird. Hope this helps

‚ÄúAt least band aid lost‚Äù me everytime.

dont autoaim

Snake prairie is a supercell made map which was there almost on the day of release, so that doesn't count.
---
Don‚Äôt spam all 3 shots unless you‚Äôre positive you‚Äôll hit all 3. Her reload without snappy sniping is very slow so you need to maximize your shots. Using 2 shots to ‚Äúframe‚Äù a player is a good strategy. Shoot one where you think they‚Äôll go and one in a different direction to ‚Äúframe‚Äù them. Helps keep them honest and a lot of times you‚Äôll end up landing one of the two. Aim for corners too. People love to hide and she can hit just around a corner where people think they‚Äôre safe.
---
hes a streamer and is part of nova esports. He's ben streaming this daily. lol.
---
Aim well. And save super to protect your self from suprise close hand combat. BUT dont auto tap it! Actually aim away. Otherwise your a sitting duck. Unless the guy low health and you 3 shot him when landing.
---
Pay attention to where your enemies are
---
Starpoint mega box
---
where did I shame you? lol

---
Removed. Keep your post titles descriptive and provide context. Additionally do not use low effort/all caps/clickbait titles.
---
Am piper main with 760 trophies,I ain‚Äôt pro but decent piper player
---
-Don‚Äôt keep shooting ur shots,wait until u ensure it‚Äôll land,so keep aiming if that enemy is juking well.
---
-With piper u never have friends in showdown other than a piper or dyna,most of the times u will get backstabbed.
---
-Most important thing with piper in showdown to do at first is to simply get her ult then focus on killing.
---
-Use her ult to run away mostly,never use it to chase enemies with low health,and ofc,ur ult destroys walls,which is a plus for u,if any thrower throwing on y‚Äôall and feeling comfy,keep destroying each wall in the map that can hide throwers behind it and throw.
---
-lastly,try to open the walls in the smaller maps,so u will open the map for ur brawler(princess piper)so u will have easier time landing ur shots and be more helpful to your team:)
---
Peace
---
Lol k
---
Nah just remove it. Nobody likes that Mode anyway.
---
Who even ever played Brawl Ball?
---
Ya..... idk i just want 2 post it
---
Actually, I agree. Brawl ball isn't fun. Just remove it.
---
I got every brawler on power 9 or 10 except 8-bit. and yes i noticed since the update too.. only 1-2 starpowers int  his time
---
His star power makes his super 50% bigger
---
He should in theory be able to dual wield guns. Maybe that will be his second star power....
---
I loved the skin, at first i thought it looked terrible in the sneak peaks but that was just youtube compression, i do still despise the new walking animations though.
---
Ricochet remodel was useless
---
#cool
---
I was one of the first to find this. I thought i could try switching Bit's star power with pam so the turret range grows longer. But instead it went to a damage boost. I did it on Nita, Jessie, Penny. It was cool.
---
You can see the enemy ain't 10 lvl
---
 Problem is that it is sooooo easy to get pinched on the map, but yeah, I agree :3
---
Bruh your shelly was the noobest
---
Ok
---
Me with 8-Bit in Spike‚Äôs super trying to escape.
---
Me teammates: Don‚Äôt just stand there do something
---
that's also a good idea
---
I haven‚Äôt had a whole lot of it. The box locations really tend to lead to 1v1s instead of the pinching on other maps.
---
Its true but i like heist more.  The comunity has chosen

ÏòàÏùò Î∞îÎ•∏ Ïñ¥Î¶∞Ïù¥Í∞Ä Îê©ÏãúÎã§ -Leon.

Road rage. He is on discount. 30 gems is standers for 8-bit. And you will get them soon enough
---
YES RICOHET TEAM
---
Loli did it with Pam. It replaces her super
---
it's only once per match
---
Am i late?
---
Guess i am?
---
But i still have some ideas
---
Maybe new tags like neutral brawler and more...
---
Congrats on 200.000 subs
---
Very accurate
---
Whate phone do you use
---
I both like og an new version and for Ricochet I prefer the og but the new golden skin is cool
---
The fact that it won't be added into the game after the terminator movie comes out hurts üò¢
---
r/titlegore
---
The funny thing is that the enemy didnt have the star power
---
We have the same username, nice
---
He wins
---
Somebody noticed that he said way two times?
---
Sorry to bring it to you. But it was just a noob Shelley. Not your skill

How does this get less Karma than that "me and the boys seeing the CEO of racism"

lol. wait till he gets his next star power too lol

That Shelly omg üòÇüòÇ

Someone posted them on here. It was a really big list

Brawl ball is the best game mode by far
---
Gameboy
---
It would bw incredible if they could add character from other franchises permanently into the game! And supercell have already said they want to
---
Or is it?
---
Just use T O O N L I N K
---
Lol u r the 3rd person to do it i guess
---
Surprising how I didn't notice this until now
---
Can we sue Supercell for attempted scamming of Singaporeans?
---
Brawl stars vr leaked footage
---
Thank you!
---
Bruh I have every character except for the legendaries, and I opened a mega box with a 0.08% chance and got nothing. I‚Äôve only gotten a mega box 4 times and I have never gotten a brawler
---
Its cute on gene
---
Cause u keep grinding
---
This is totally unplayable
---
I'd say change it to face expressions. I thought that Coninute 3, was this face (-3-)
---
So i was dreaming thinking that i was the first one :(
---
How the fuck did this end up in my feed
---
I play lots of Robocraft so until this post i m thinking that Rank 20 is Protonium rank xd.
---
I thought it just does 30% more damage?
---
Fancy/Snazzy thicco.
---
Just another day for randoms.
---
Youre right but piper looks dumb with no teeth
---
Don't give people ideas...
---
I hope they fix the bug soon.
---
Its better when he has no teeth
---
Poopoohead stole my post too. I'll just say this, #STOPTHEREPOSTS
---
more like "pennis" penny+mortis
---
I can't count the times where I was yelling at my screen for people to just go down and out of the way. We have enough gems and the others are nowhere near ten, you don't need to top up you moron. And then they die, and we lose.
---
Club mail?
---
you purchased it? because i also purchased it,i got beta tester from a cracked version of the game
---
He‚Äôs great. Take note that if you aim and shoot moving in one direction his shots fan out. If you do that in the other direction they concentrate on one point. It‚Äôs useful in different situations
---
u/TheArtist_15
---
He did it again
---
It indicates you ability is ready. A full yellow bar confuses people
---
No. Don't bother with him. He is just seeking some attention and drama. Well, it's hard to get some when your only friends leave you because of it.
---
We had power cubes but iedit them out cause they were ugly
---
r/lostredditors

Thanks for the tip
---
Instantly I appreciate playing Brawl Stars without volume on. Is it really that loud? I haven't heard 8-Bit's suepr before.
---
Cuz in the drawing he is oppening he's mouth more

Yeah we had powercubes but i edit them out cause they were ugly

For a FTP I think I would wait for the deep discounted skins, 150 gem that go down to 59 or 69. Dragon knight Jessie, Rockabilly Mortis(or night witch), Serenade Poco. Some of the 80 gem skins have been on sale for 39, Summer Jessie and Beach Brock.   
---
The 8 bit is cool if you have gems to spare, but I probably wouldn't buy it in your case.
---
How? Like total trophy total? Or like when someone brings there new friend who just got Leon at 1k and he wants to try it out with his friend?
---
Happy cake day.....have my free upvotes on all your posts.

Stop reposting

Guys chill brawl ball is the most favourite game mode by the community. I understand why you hate bralw ball because you like crow. Usually crow isn't good in brawl ball. In my opinion crow is a decent brawler!
---
The problem with 8-bit, is that he has insane dps and really good health, but his health needs to be more because he gets hit by every attack
---
That's not true anymore. They factor in overall trophies. But only up to a certain threshold. I think it's like 3-4k, then you get thrown in with everyone else. But as with everything in the matchmaking system, they **try** to find you the best match.
---
He is the kind of kid Who laughs At the joke from a teacher
---
use Nita with 8-Bit‚Äôs boosted booster SP. just trust me it‚Äôs so much fun
---
Sadly brawl ball is slowly getting ruined by teamers who score their own goal, thus making you purposely lose trophies.
---
Oh my lord OKAY, THANKS FOR RUINING THE JOKE
---
this is why u go to the dentist
---
lol did you expect a lot from 10 boxes smashed together into one
---
Belle Delphine?
---
I think 8-bit can still dodge the cannon balls, but if he stops it turns around for a SECOND, then ouch.
---
Absolutely amazing woaw
---
It's better to buy boxes if you want actual value from starpoints and not just wanna buy a random cool skin lmao
---
The other solutions, in my opinion, just ban teams with a very large trophy difference ( I am not talking about individual TOTAL trophies). 
---
I suspect majorities do not even play with friends or in-game often, so I guess it would probably just make some people unhappy but the majorities would be so glad to see this.
---
I thought it was only happening on Androids
---
It's literally the only good thing shotgunners are good at
---
I'm really struggling not to take it personally that Bounty is on a 3 day rotation now üò≠üò≠üò≠ that's pretty much the only mode I play these days. I don't care for brawl ball at all...perhaps I'll have to indulge in a new game now üòû
---
Tornados, Ice, lightening, poison smoke, flame thrower, gravity im just saying there‚Äôs a lot of different possibilities for attacks and supers cooler stuff ya kno.
---
As said. If they start something they sould finish it. 
---
If you domt accept then u dont =)
---
Have a nice day, sir.
---
Yeah,on a lot of devices,including mine, after finishing a match the game will likely crash
---
I think diamond should be sapphire
---
I can record if u want proof
---
Exactly. They are ruining people's fun.
---
Oh I'm sorry man hope supercell fixes this
---
Satanic *
---
Again, Matchmaking is calculated by the Trophy count of your Brawler not the Power Level
---
So guys, how THICC is pam? Notice these are rough estimates and this should be mathematically correct as long as everything is normal. So the technique to figure all of this out is called Pixel Measuring. Its when we find something that we have average dimensions for in the real world, and are able to count pixels and set up a proportion into the game to figure out what the sizes of in-game objects are. I have this handy dandy mobile app which will help us do this So I was pondering over objects I could use in the real world that are in brawl stars, I first thought of pocos guitar, but we don't know what guitar that actually is. So I came to the conclusion that Dynamike‚Äôs dynamite is the most average we can use. The average size of dynamite is 8 inches long, or 20 centimeters. Now that we have that, we must pixel measure the length of the Dynamikes‚Äôs dynamike ingame and set up a proportion between the 2. So after measuring the stick of dynamite, it is around 134 pixels long. Now that we have that, we can figure out how many inches 1 pixel is. SO we must divide 8 by 134 to get inches per pixel, plugin that into a calculator roughly gives us 0.059 inches per pixel. With that, we must now pixel measure Pam. After pixel measuring Pam, she comes out to be 260 on the dot. With that, we multiply that our earlier number of around 0.059ish to get... 15.52 inches. Or 39.43 centimeters. Sooo, how big is that. Well unfortunately we don't have any statistics just for length, so we need to also take a side view to get one last measurement. So sideways it's 190 pixels, multiply by the earlier number and that gives us 11.34 inches. We now have a rectangle, now we must inscribe an ellipse within said rectangle to figure out the circumference. So I found this online plug in sort of thing to figure out the circumference of this ellipse, and by plugging in we get 42.46 inches in circumference. Looking at CDCs, the Center for Disease Control, records, the average US waist size is 38.7 inches in circumference for a woman. And comparing to other websites I can say without a string of doubt, Pam is...... THICC. On a serious note she is actually unhealthily large and we shouldn't be celebrating it. But hey, that's just a theory, a Brawl theory.
---
no one will notice your post in this subreddit, try to repost this in a different subreddit... like r/BrawlStarsReplay .
---
I knew it... His super is too powerful if all projectiles hit
---
Or try certain star powers when in the shop!
---
Could you be nicer?
---
I know that he stole art but at least he changed.
---
yes but can't do comparaison with previous version !
---
It didn't.

Man Darryl was really nerfed this update.
---
From a band aid user, it‚Äôs strong but not OP. Shell shock actually has a chance to see play in Gem Grab or something
---
what if they did it and if you are the star player it changes to "new highscore"
---
**like that**
---
:)
---
no
---
Not after the nerf it‚Äôs not so good
---
Should be called termin8- bit

I do not like the rating part. But it's good to watch the meme review series. Good content.
---
Another great drawing from one of my favorite community artists!
---
Primo didn't get a remodel nor smoother animations :(
---
Thanks bro!!!!
---
Phoenix Crow
---
Nice
---
Why does Leon look good without it? It completely changes his ‚Äúfeel‚Äù
---
You're right but what I actually mean is that some criticism is not even that good to be considered as a feedback e.g not getting a brawler
---
Also I'm sorry for my bad English..
---
^smol
---
Ok then u/FortniteBush23
---
Eww
---
:/ I was like 5900 trophies when update was released.
---
Strange because this started to happen when the update came out
---
Thank you. I also recognize your name :D
---
He‚Äôs not, his walking animation just got polished
---
I guess I have good luck but this happens very rarely to me. But yeah sucks
---
You welcome!!
---
Really? What do you remember me for?
---
u/Brawlstarsmath
---
They're setting the stage for next brawler. Who will be a dentist. His super, along with breaking walls, can also break teeth.
---
And the funny thing is that of course you won't get upvotes

900 mortis and 900 Shelly. We won against a double dip team, I have it screen recording.
---
I was so excited about the update because of all the new things added but the map changes made it absolutely horrible for me. Cause seeing Brawl ball and Seige appearing at the same time is an total nightmare.
---
DAMN!! The fact that i have to see brawl ball every single day !!!!!!!
---
Hahaha üòÇ but the animation is amazing though, so I don‚Äôt see the reason to complain about this really small error
---
Rush safe cuka blyet

Bibi
---
Cake day is when you have had a Reddit account for a year
---
He is sorry people found out

---
Same, the golden skins are to flex

And da funny thing is that I don‚Äôt care, I‚Äôm not crazy for karma
---
Mass shooters?
---
Shelly players are at  a low now most Shelly‚Äôs have switched to piper like the Op here
---
A megabox.
---
Why didn't you just kill them? WTF is with all this spinning?!
---
Happy cake day
---
Ok .. thanks!
---
If we don‚Äôt criticize them they don‚Äôt fix the mistakes they make, if all we ever did was thank them for their work this game would be 10x worse
---
Well played !

A comment from long ago, your username and flair

Thanks
---
Ah ok
---
WOW, THIS IS AMAZING, I REALLY HOPE THAT THEY CONSIDER ADDING IT!!!
---
i loved the old siege it was the best mode to push trophies i was mostly playing siege before the change
---
Your comment is 20% of what I get and this is annoying
---
Ok, so she‚Äôs a strong brawler, just not game breaking anymore like she used to be 
---
Oh haha
---
That would be a neat actually!
---
Yeah, since it has supercell in it and all :)
---
Yeah, I agree, also congrats on making it to 1k.
---
Yo no need to swear
---
The normal animation actually has her eye open, but it was closed on the second winning screen for some  reason. Though I do agree that her new animation is much more fluid.
---
Well me too
---
Pony

Omg!!!!!!!!!!! Never thought I‚Äôd have a post to 1k

Don't give him attention.

Weird, if supercell sees this I‚Äôm sure they will fix it :3

I have the same issue. Touch is perfectly fine. It's so annoying.

Thanks! I opened 3 Big Boxes, 15 small boxes and 2 mega boxes tomorrow, and no luck. But today I got it

True. This is honestly a bit harsh.

It worked after the optional update! Moreover, i got tara from a mega box too!

And BTW I was trying to have SUPERCELL notice this so it‚Äôd come back

*Game theory intro*
---
Nice, now it's ur turn üòâ
---
Yes. It isn't diverse enough to have it's own slot. Thank you. But unfortunately I don't think this change will be reverted any time soon.
---
Omg how did you make it look so realistic???
---
Of course it's not going to happen, people have been asking for life leech and old rico remodel but  it never happened, so logically the song won't come either (even though it's sick)
---
I noticed it too
---
oof
---
Every color has some gemstone that goes with it. This really isn‚Äôt a big deal at all.
---
Do you guys seriously play for hours at a time? I‚Äôm curious cus I LOVE this game more than anything else but the most I see myself playing in one single sitting is maybe 30-45 minutes max.
---
This isn‚Äôt even all the brawlers
---
TO THE NETHER BOIIIIIIIS üò≠

He should be 18 now after aloha

For me buying 950 gems so yes.

Penny hard counters him with her new star power

Whadabout piper... Leon skin... Tara skin... voices... Night crow...

Omfg, this is GENIUS, but(t) honestly poor 8-bit.

lots of 9.99 or 14.98s are common popluar banner in many mobile games.

Dynamike to Barley wasn't that good tbh
---
I'm also sg :)
---
Cool concept and artwork but I feel it‚Äôs a bit to busy  and it would be hard to see all the details in game
---
How did you get this? And where?
---
100 trophies per day that's very easy lol
---
Computer 8 bit
---
Subredditu gresit
---
I noticed once you hit lvl 7 or 8 on a brawler you get some big offers in the shop for brawler points that usually let you get a complete level out of it the hard part is getting the gold to max your brawlers though
---
Oh man I still watched it
---
When I grow up I think it's not for kids may be for +10
---
Stupid teamers
---
Thank you for the suggestion :)
---
If only you had 6 more star points...
---
For you
---
I mean 8 bits the best brawler right now
---
Poco - Papyrus, not Sans
---
I got spike
---
Uno Reverse Card
---
thank

If I get all Brawlers to r25
---
Do I get a full emerald set?
---
He‚Äôs leavened his mistake, leave him alone
---
Gotta flex
---
Fucking P2W losee
---
But the memes for poco are - sans when he rages with blue eye that's the point
---
Which is why i said an AI, dont think that would be realistic but hey a man can dream cant he
---
I think the penny is Pennis
---
Out playing annoying scrubs like a boss.
---
Why
---
C H ·ªå N
---
Will you stream duos or make video with those skins? I would love to see them in game against real players even tho they don't have any special effects.
---
That's my point I should be complaining with those chances still don't have legendary
---
or sakura piper
---
does the attack boost stack?
---
Ggs bro, I'm in a similar boat, close to 12k trophies but I do have Leon, I unlocked him several months ago, I imagine I'll die before I get crow or spike :)
---
You post sucks
---
I CANT FIND A COIN SLOT
---
Nice video, but for the love of god. Pick better music next time.
---
Kk. Thx for the feedback üëç
---
I don't even have a twitch,
---
the game still needs very few changes it feels bad to see your brawler tilted too much every season end
---
no u
---
Sad that he shoots Colt's chocolate
---
Why is it cursed I feel so out of the loop like 3 people have said that now xD
---
Get em both.
---
Yes, please.
---
I have to farm 120 cup to my leon to upgrade its rank from 22 to 23...
---
How would you kill that Leon if you was Piper then?
---
Well, I‚Äôm an ok player. I don‚Äôt destroy people with Leon like people do to me. But he‚Äôs fun to play with. Enjoy.
---
Honestly I‚Äôd do the Summer one, you can buy a star power and also get 8 boxes and gems
---
So u cheated b4
---
Maybe if u didn't, i apologize
---
hayato.
---
Having OP bandaid vs when it gets nerfed
---
Ahh portrait mode! Bring back 2017 nostalgia
---
I agree.
---
Actually Pam is thiccer
---
Maybe because i played skull creek when i where at 500 account trophies, then i stopped playing showdown a lot, but yes
---
666 upvotes??!??!
---
Mecha Bo looks much better IN THE MENU
---
Mecha crow have awesome effects tho
---
So basically, the joke here is that since Piper lost her teeth with her remodel, maybe all the other brawlers would lose their teeth if they got remodeled.
---
Your post has been removed, make sure to use the body of a post to elaborate on the title.

but wasnt it a bit hard to control when portrait mode?

Thnx for the suggestion :D

There was this thing called tap2move

He isnt that OP anymore tho

Your username totally fits with your commentüëçüèª

Just crow?, I believe we could name a few more in that list tbh.

I mean, I haven't really seen it in action. But that's not how it's been described.

Get the meme please

Next copypasta?

They way I‚Äôm thinking it works is you know the countdown? It removes that once per game for you

I love it!

OH I'm so dumb lmao

Oh. My. God.

Calm your tits, he should‚Äôve said ranks not levels

But will that be harder to dodge? Actually I started the game just few days before global launch so i dont know  a lot about it

Mortis is spared
---
Bro I got my first legendary at 11k stop whining
---
I dont know
---
Not not really, every brawlers movement speed was pretty slow and you just have to tap to move kinda making it easier to dodge, you should look at it on YT I‚Äôm sure there are a few 2017 vids out there
---
Ik houd hier van, dat een Nederlander dit maakt ontroert mij
---
Bruh the ui that shows thw star points why would they do it like that. I literally spent 30 mins trying to find it and they literally hide it in the rank.

Am I the one, who thinks that her eyebrows are quite strange?

also even if he wasnt a machine he could just have big bones

Well played, ngl though the bming was kinda funny

the theory here is primo or bull shooted the camera XD

Garnet and Pearl aren't there :(

Nice catch, that's fun!

They really put so much love into this little guy.

He‚Äôs unhealthily large. Hmm no wonder he‚Äôs so slow
---
Lmao i love how Frank transforms into Dynamike by spinning
---
The reason why the enemy team losses is because they have shitty aiming not celebrate too early
---
I do too but f2ps don't really have a choice
---
I need more explanation.
---
Uhm. Ok. I got Pennis from a cursed image. Wasn't really a joke bud
---
Of course they are! Who's Obsidian composed of? üòâ

8-bits are nuking each other on 0-100 level showdowns
---
niceeeee
---
where is the map lol
---
I'm with u but I just can't seem to stop playing
---
My record is 8 people who were watching me
---
Loll thats exactly what I imagined
---
I think his skin is way too simple. I know it's 30 gems. But there could be little texture changes, like with Bandita Shelly.
---
NOICE!
---
You can only use it once. Let's wait until it comes out.
---
8-bits new star power is bandaid

Are you posting this on all of the brawl stars posts?
---
Ahhh haha
---
Ur late to the party man before this update and before global it was known as the bronze silver gold ranking list or whatever
---
Tap on the brawlers rank when you select them
---
It shouldn‚Äôt be physically possible for 8bit to do that.
---
I worry for his hips.
---
When ben 10 gets access to the master control
---
My colleague is at 5k and just unlocked spike today, already has leon at power 10.
---
I'm at 9.8k without tara or any legendaries.
---
but there is also the violet area so
---
Very cool art gamer but.. that‚Äôs not how you use a scope
---
Matpat needs to see this
---
Darryl as Sans?
---
Actually, that makes sense
---
Sadly its not.
---
The El Primo jumping with super is my favorite part :)
---
bold of you to assume that f2p players like me actually have leon
---
Bruh she's not Shelly is Chelly bro
---
Happy cake day.

Glad that Tara kept all 416 of her teeth!
---
Can someone get the mods to ban him? He‚Äôs obviously just a troll but hes spamming the subreddit w a lotta poste
---
your language is?
---
Random thought but I always thought if sloths could run they‚Äôd be scary as hell
---
Ellll Bitooooo!!!
---
agree with everything except paying for rejecting.
---
Why on earth do we have to pay for rejecting?
---
I don't see you have ever advocated the government to tax women who have rejected men twice or more.
---
So how did you come up with this stupid idea?.
---
I thought of that too, but his head spins, sooo
---
why she doesn't have teeth
---
With penny super it's even op.
---
At 1:00
---
Yes they do
---
You dont need to see where the base is, just the radius of effect. You can work out where the centre point is located by that, and see if it's still active.
---
As penny and Jessie's supers dont have a visible radius of attack, if they weren't displayed in bushes you could forget you'd placed one or assume its destroyed, then drop another one in a less optimal position.
---
Band aid weak point.

Not how you use the format
---
It's more like, if they had made a pink version prior to the remodel, they'd have to retexture it all over again after the remodel.
---
Just like Tara. There's no point in retexturing a model you know you're going to throw away and redo, it's just double the amount of work.
---
yeah i saw it
---
911 what's your emergency? 
---
ME:Someone bullies Poco!!!
---
Sir for emergencies like this call Supercell.
---
ME: OK thank you.
---
Ryan:Ryan here what's your emergency?
---
ME:Mortis bullies Poco!!!
---
Instantly closes phone 
---
Balance chnges:
---
Poco's damage increased with 100%
---
Everyone else's damage decresed by 75%
---
Or maybe, just MAYBE, the gene juked the shots well
---
GEKOLONISEERD
---
What the hell you did to my boy tick
---
this meme refers to the cost of the skins, not the brawler
---
so close
---
Crow
---
Brock actually looks semi normal
---
Hah at 8k the only brawler that is missing is leon.
---
And so o can get the mega box at 8k before they release a new brawler lol
---
things like this comment you made are exactly why the hat jokes died tho
---
Yaa yesterday my shelly was skating..... On floor
---
It would cost you ¬£0 to have not said this
---
Omg my sister got Mortis, too! today at 2k( she has Tara AND Leon.. and i at 8k nothing)
---
And perino looks like a cute little kid
---
Prime
---
yay :D
---
I just got spike this morning, im gonna burst üò©üçÜüí¶
---
yeah i know
---
I wonder if supercell would not put there on skin in the game literally there game why they dont got a skinüòÖüòÖ
---
Colgate will help you
---
Penny and bull feel faster with there new animations...or maybe its becous i play alot with 8 bit
---
Lol just realised Peach eye's brows are black while she is blonde.
---
He really isn't good for showdown. But he can be really strong in the right situation in many other modes
---
I wish but no i dont have any
---
It's not
---
Why unfortunate? Every one deserves a chance of getting a skin that is bound to a event
---
But I love arcade games
---
the chairs are taller than poco. *poco is the average size of a human being*
---
What‚Äôs this challenge?
---
Glad u liked! 
---
check out [Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/cxl7xz/part_3_the_ultimate_rush/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app) and [Part 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/cxmg5x/part_4_air_time/)
---
Thank you kind person
---
Alright, I thought I was getting a little overboard too
---
I dont know why but the locked toothless Leon is making me laugh the most. It's as if he's staring at you from a cage like, "just wait until i get out of here hehehehe".
---
Se emoji hater hater
---
Exactly, it's so unfair.
---
They could of had us so many times, we got lucky and the penny turret is op
---
Mine is 1500 what
---
69 downvotes here you go
---
I got two mythical in one day back at like 1200üòÇ I‚Äôm sitting at like 7.8k now but still
---
I just feel like it should at least show when you bought it or something because they said it would be an exclusive skin and I think a lot of people bought it because of that
---

FLEX TAPE CLEAR VERSION
---
At least this guys not trying to start a petition
---
Give her a Top Hat and then she becomes Mortis.
---
This is so well drawn , amazing
---
What's your phone name 
---
6s or 6s plus
---
What is ocd ?
---
he lost on previous end seasons
---
I'd spin, suicide, send a friend request and drop an F in team chat to pay respect
---
Happy microphone day
---
Yeah, you do have a good point
---
I'd smash ;)
---
It‚Äôs a crappy photoshop
---
Like trying to mine obsidian using your hand with fatigue
---
What the ...
---
Also i thought of french fries when i read "French ..."
---
Ok I was about to say- sorry I‚Äôm too tired to think
---
dude, the health of gene was at 69 :$ NICE, BLESSED!
---
Sorry the first one I uploaded the wrong video....
---
this is the real Part 4! enjoy!
---
.21 % Playing since android release, 0 legendaries
---
yEs PLeS
---
Not stonks
---
Especially if there's a period of invincibility
---
Poor bibi
---
sorry that first one was a fake upload
---
This isn‚Äôt even a question for me
---
Sheley, Bull, Primo, Rosa, Morti, Leo, Tara, Frank, Bibi, Darrel ##RIP
---
Super now breaks walls
---
I'll give it a week
---
Holy crap look at spike.
---
you have a talent
---
Draw bibi
---
Supa Lucha Primo!!!!!
---
Dude he reposts good post downvotes them and posts it
---
Really cool
---
Lol. Why are people taking this guy seriously? I mean, I could bet my life he's a troll, look at his name, the drawing. I'm loving it.
---
How ranks are there now ?
---
The game takes me out every five minutes, fix it please.
---
If the Spike didn't have teeh in the pic, the title would probably be like "Spike with Piper's teeth. Wait...."
---
I spended 130 dollars and got spike and about 5 lv10s good enough
---
I was joking geez
---
Thx man
---
I would‚Äôve thought you could? Idk. Wouldn‚Äôt tour friend ready up and then you quickly do the glitch or doesn‚Äôt it work. I haven‚Äôt tried so I wouldn‚Äôt know
---
Barley always team with dynamike üòÇ
---
Sorry,, I was just saying :S
---
"Obsessive-compulsive disorder¬†(OCD) is an anxiety¬†disorder¬†in which time people have recurring, unwanted thoughts, ideas or sensations (obsessions) that make them feel driven to do something repetitively (compulsions). ... Many people have focused thoughts or repeated¬†behaviors."
---
Pretty much people with ocd have a need for perfection, not having it results in stress and a need to fix it.
---
So is he no longer, because if you like that type of brawler, then i would probably go crow. I preffer Leon, and i think you do, but crow is also agile, with ok damage.
---
Damn that's hot
---
Thx for telling us I always get confuse when people‚Äôs use small words
---
That was fast
---
Only thing I agree on is new ranks. I‚Äôm a 14k player who‚Äôs spent ages grinding the leaderboard every season after trophies reset and now theyre telling me I could‚Äôve just waited and got all those trophies so easily
---
Amazing
---
Have you ever heard of the swapping star powers glitch?
---
I love crow but he isnt the one
---
Thanks, I hate it
---
For all that time that it took them to release the update, an icon fix is a simple one. He‚Äôs right though, the community is toxic asf
---
I have 13k wanna play?
---
I mean 30 gems is a recolour value and we are just asking for a recolour of the skin. It‚Äôs not to much to ask as the other 30 gem skins definitely have more aspects recolored
---
They are randoms
---
I know what it is, but not how to do it
---
I got paired up with the worst people
---
Not to mention that smile is weird and unfitting.
---
They want for everything to look perfect, not having it results in stress and a need to fix it.
---
Not as unfitting as Pipers Icon.
---
Pretty sure that‚Äôs meant to be the least used
---
there is still a possibility that piper is an Asian with blonde hair
---
He took pipers teeth
---
Ew emoji hater hater hater hater
---
Just some balance changes will be good.
---
Improvise Adapt Overcome
---
i am speed
---
No that‚Äôs stressful !!
---
you don't even know hoe to crop a photo. duh
---
???
---
64 kArMa!!1!1
---
He‚Äôs probably just trying it out, cut him some slack.
---
Same lol
---
And his super too
---
Racism

i don't know why i juat said my opinin . BOOM 19-
---
im killed miself
---
Hahaha poor mortis XD
---
Dynamike. :)
---
3 mega boxes won‚Äôt get you a legendary... just open them whenever a new brawler comes out that requires opening boxes
---
Sorry
---
Why do I feel like I‚Äôve seen your username somewhere?
---
Dont worry - you have 2 more days!
---
Again piper don‚Äôt have teeth‚Äôs  jk üòÇ ( nice that‚Äôs amazing üòâ)
---
I make shrek hentai
---
I‚Äôll be satisfied with that for September too
---
He needs to lighten up. When he wins he should have a ^_^ face!
---
Should be given for free
---
Who cares at least no creepy responses to a piper post (cause she looks under age).
---
IMPOSSIBLE for anyone that isnt in global leaderboards
---
agreed
---
so basically Daisy
---
Thanks for this, I'm probably the only one here who likes ikon and Leon
---
I took the doublers and opened Mortis thanks to the 2 box that I got F2P
---
Smooth trasitions, awesome edit, 10/10 post
---
I want more! LOL
---
The game takes me out every five minutes. Fix it please.
---
dab
---
You don't have to buy anything to get those skins
---
 ppl will get mad for losing and report ppl fpr no reason
---
Ik how. Don't be aggressive in showdown stay alive
---
Why r/engrish
---
Can we get p1 on 8-bits gun and p2 on the classic skins gun? üéÆ
---
There's another gold Mecha bo. He's name is Trevor.
---
Wow I wasn't expecting to see gold mechas until the next season. Congratulations u guys are the BS gods
---
Desperately
---
wtf 150 gems and 2000 coins thats like 20 dollars worth of gems and coins
---
Me too
---
Yeah each GLOBAL supercell games have around 30~50 ppl 
---
Rush wars only have 18
---
But I actually think that this has to do with the new brawler, because lots of people are just using him and  I think that this makes something in the match making when you are playing a normal brawler matching you with less trophies people
---
Supercell hate teeth
---
Why don‚Äôt you try playing showdown and see how many are in it, maybe even post a picture here?
---
Is anyone shaking?
---
Thats op bruv
---
 It‚Äôs shit they‚Äôll never give you gems for that even if it was GOOD
---
I can't believe some ppl get cheesy views by telling these garbage to naive childrens
---
I like it
---
It really change my mind
---
Thank you it took a while; very much appreciated ;)
---
I thought that it was Cara Steinman, oopsie.
---
What they find in area 51
---
1. Search "8 BIT transparent" (transparent is there so there is no white background)
---
1b. Search meme template 
---
2. Download 
---
3. Open any paint app on your phone
---
4. Insert 8 Bit image
---
4b. Insert meme template 
---
5. Change transparency/opacity of 8 bit
---
6. ???
---
7. Profit
---
I'm a k-pop but I don't even think of doing that
---
Someone got crow and spike out of a box
---
I can see the effort
---
Uhh
---
Thanks for fix Supercell.
