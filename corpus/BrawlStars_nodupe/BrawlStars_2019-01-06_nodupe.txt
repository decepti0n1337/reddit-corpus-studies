So I can‚Äôt find the post/video but supercell did say bo was next up on their list for receiving a new model. And if you go on instagram and look up brianstivale, he has made a couple posts talking about how he did voice acting for bo.

You took screenshot of Landscape screen
---
But why is it vertical 
---
This is too relatable
---
So for spike you for sure want to keep your distance. He is a ranged brawler, can do a ton of damage, but doesn‚Äôt have much health so make sure to space yourself out from enemies. Also, he does have a delayed shot meaning it takes time to travel, so with time you aim will get better. Use him as a support brawler, trying to zone enemy brawlers away and use your super the same way, to block enemies off from entering and area or if they‚Äôre chasing a teamate, throw it down to help them escape. I hope this helped
---
Yes moderator this comment right here

The star power could be a little vortex that suck the enemy in for short second

Actually, I have a maxed and an non-maxed account. I can tell you that there is a problem worse than brawler levels in matchmaking. When I queue with randoms, I always get put with players like you - 300-1k trophies... THIS NEEDS TO BE FIXED.I am at 11k and do not want to be playing with newbs! Same goes for my non-maxed 7k trophy account.
---
If someone has a maxed brawler, then they should have absolutely no problem getten them to 500+ (unless that brawler is darryl). If someone has a maxed brawler at 250 trophies, then they have either just got it to level 10 and is pushing it up, or just sucks.... Most of the time, it is because the player sucks.
---
TL:DR 
---
Get good and get over it.
---
That's the point he's making here.
---
Cacnea is Spike 
---
Murkrow is Crow
---
Kecleon is Leon
---
It's within 200 trophies from what I've seen for the most part. And this picture shows that it's really not a big deal. 
---
Pretty self explanatory if u know what dodgeball is
---
Oooh

Would be better if there was a Bull, Leon, and Frank on the other team lol

Frank looks like big chungus from the way u took the ss

I had to play 25 rounds to become big brawler for the first time.
---
If you give her something like a 0.1 or 0.2 seconds decrease to her reload speed she still wouldn‚Äôt be that strong 
---
The luckiest person in the world has found the love of his/her, an enjoyable job and no struggles at all. You just had some small luck. 
---
You can change the joystick to fixed in the options if that can help.
---
It is pretty fun, especially with token doubles. I got big brawler like 4 times straight but nothing since. My only tiff is that your health as big brawler goes down when you're not getting hit. 
---
I'd rate this an an insult. 
---
Point^^
---
Wouldn‚Äôt barley be like the plant barley that‚Äôs used for alcohol, and barely throws alcohol?

Wow add this skin right now supercell!!

I think Jessie derives from the name "Jessie" from Toy Story (they look very similar).
---
Old memories

Skill closes the gap lol. If you are a skilled player, a brawlers star power is rarely a determining factor in the outcome of a fight.

Okay jeez just a Reddit title

If you look through the sub for CR, you‚Äôll see war day matchups that differ by over 2000 trophies. Same with 2v2 matchups.

To avoid the United states (Normal people) vs The entire world (wierdos) just call it brawl ball
---
Thank, I never realized this
---
Am Brit can confirm
---
so true!!
---
not sure if to laugh or cry lol
---
lol 
---
At school we used to play a game that's kinda like this, it is called "V√∂lkerball"
---
Is Jessie because she looks a bit like Jessie from toy story?
---
Your post has been removed, make sure to use the body of a post to elaborate on the title.
---
The colors should ve reversed since the Pink Pekka is classified as a woman in previous games  and is technically the "momma pekka" to the blue pekka. which should be the bear.
---
Exactly my point. But there are so many posts from newer players saying that Primo is OP
---
r/titlegore
---
Try and either fake your attacks, you seem to be attacking pushing in but then you just turn and walk away (just a quick second or two) but then immediately snap back and shoot them, or you can try and play more defensive and jucking your way closer towards them, unless you are a long ranged character. Then I would say try and stay on your max range maybe a little bit closer and hold angels so they can‚Äôt sneak up on you
---
P.s Sry bad English 
---
The noobs must learn it the hard way. At first they will always hate teaming
---
Same have every brawler except Leon rn and reached 11k also endgame is bad rn 
---
That‚Äôs an Easy joke

*W H O O P S I E S*

This is actually hilarious

F for spike

How do you get that little icon on ur username of Pam ?
---
That's so cool. I if that skin is in the game I would buy it as fast as I can.
---
That's what I'm talking about
---
Dude I'm joking lol
---
actually, poco has a hat of "mariachi" 
---
Love it! Make another!
---
Go to the main page of r/Brawlstars and click in the ‚Äò‚Äô...‚Äô‚Äô icon and clik again in ‚Äò‚ÄôChange user flair‚Äô‚Äôthen you pick the character you want.. 
---
Sorry if I can‚Äôt describe it well, im not native :/ , hope this can help you anyway (:
---
What is the problem ?
---
Crow is one of the best once you learn how to properly use him. Mistakes are punished hard but if you don't fuck up you can slowly chip down any and everyone.
---
Poco means little
---
I like the idea but the map is too caotic i think
---
Give Gems
---
The fact that you can protect the ball by putting it into your spawn. We have been asking for he exact opposite
---
Thank you (:
---
But they are not winning...
---
Every match I play, the enemies stay half of the match‚Äôs time back there, and its impossible to get the ball like this, so basically, they stop the game while they are losing 
---
No matter what the highest player on the blue team was no where close to the lowest on reds team. When i say 500 trophies difference i mean adding the trophies on both teams then comparing them.
---
This is really well made lmao
---
Welcome! (;
---
/ Crow hehehe
---
You can modify the flair after posting
---
Nah, it‚Äôs ok. Getting kills is great, but his main role is area denial. Since nonody wants to walk over a Barley‚Äôs puddle (assuming they have no death wish), they will be forced to retreat. Sometimes this won‚Äôt deal much damage, but the area control you get is worth it
---
Alternatively
---
Red team has an advantage 
---
Then what's the problem? You'll win.
---
The second option should be, ‚Äútrio?‚Äù
---
YOU BRICK!!!
---
Well I got to last 4 with their protection and then since they all had their supers I just suicided and gave them a parting gift by firing my super on them before I died

Agreed. A very important part of gem grab is being able to retreat into a bush at spawn and hide when you have 10 gems
---
I know a youtuber that works with supercell  called Vosketal (he is french) so do you want me to show your brawler, maybe it could get in the game! (obviously i will credit you and not me to Vosketal for the concept )
---
Taste, the SUUUUUN
---
I still don‚Äôt get crow‚Äôs.
---
6 for sure
---
Wait wtf? Maybe they paid for boxes and played with other brawlers to get tokens and level up
---
That‚Äôs a reference to his super...
---
Don‚Äôt tempt me

Awesome, thank you!!

When choosing your name if you do something like &lt;c#(1-9) **example** c&gt; you get a coloured name

sometime if stand in the same tile nothing will hit your enemy xD  i try this aginst shelly  i use my super in her cuz she use her super in someone in she is low health     and i deal 0 damage 
---
For the last month yeah.
---
Damien is a very mischievous brawler that loves to play evil pranks, and enjoys others suffering. I didn‚Äôt make any stats for him because I wanted the community to have a chance to contribute to this design.
---
Although I would love feedback and all your ideas I also have some ideas of my own. I think is main attack should pierce because he throws flaming forks. I also think his super should have some sort teleporting mechanic. But in the end it‚Äôs up to you guys, so feel free to go nuts!
---
Was this photo shot on a flip phone or something ?

How did you not win? Mortis is the strongest brawler in the game!

This was me last week

Not bad. Nita next!

The boss has a THICCCCCCCC hitbox
---
i just said why he is bad and you said nothing
---
This doesn‚Äôt really fit since he isn‚Äôt being an arrogant douche. 
---
You said specific interactions without arguments, just saying it as if it were a fact. That and judging your posts made me realize you don't know what you are talking about, so you don't deserve any time. Keep saying whatever you want, because I don't care, you are just another random guy who think is good
---
I like it when I‚Äôm a supered Leon and when I go into a bush every1 starts shooting randomly in the showdown map
---
Then I come out of the bush BM spinning at them
---
oh god oh fuck why is everything so fast
---
Nahh i dont really want those off meta and meta things into all games i just want all balanced and that small groups of brawlers are good on some maps and some not
---
Excuse me, I thought someone here would speak Spanish. I will have to use the translator due to my little experience with English, so I'm sure there will be mistakes.
---
you'd think this a good drake format meme
---
what about the top players are they bad to? ;)
---
sure they can do what ever they want, what i want to show is that mm is just shit and quick random games unplayable.
---
Pretty noice huh?
---
There's already a fairly good way to counter shotgunner's: wait for them to fire, immediately dash in and dash away two times. If we increase dash speed and reload time, that would make it easier.
---
Thanks
---
Trophies=best or worst. It is just about the meta. So if you don't have any good opinion by one of them, your "argument" of trophies is useless. Keep crying, I don't care
---
It's nigh noon

It was tap to shoot if you used joystick to move. If you used tap to move, you dragged to shoot.

---
This lovely play deserves everyone's upvote. I just hope its actually yours.
---
Range isn't the big problem. It won't change much if you dash up and die from shotgunners. I even suggested nerfing it a tiny bit so dribbling is harder, but increasing damage and health is important
---
yep it is.
---
HAHAHAHAHAAHHA, you are funnier than before. When did I say I got skill? Again, you are just a dude with brawlers at 300, and your on√±y argument is leaderboard. Keep talking, it is funny

Whoa there

Don‚Äôt give them any idea‚Äôs to make the skin 20 bucks...

If ur good at crow u can take out a 5 cubes jessie as a 0 cube crow thats what i did, and if ur not so good consider taking out bulls and primos

I'm pointing out how much  primos and Leon see in the same, match 
---
Worked out well for me, I don't know about you my dude.
---
I tend to be that guy who doesn‚Äôt do play again.

Mostly because I get less than decent randoms on my team.

for once your Rock's "r" looked like "c" XP

N U H N U H N U H

idk ill say around 7-8k prob but i havent gotten a single legendary and im at 10.3k almost 10.4
---
Are we still using the hat for upvotes 
---
rip but at least u can still try to get them to 500 and u will be at 5k
---
If you have any game sense he‚Äôs balanced lol
---
False. The balances changed you are suggesting lead me to believe that you have no clue as to how to play him.  His play style revolves around chip damage and charging his super. Your suggesting a buff that‚Äôs intended to have him be stronger at long range, correct? You also stated other things, such as him being able to be 2 shorted by shot gunners, in a manner that makes it seem like it‚Äôs a common occurrence, when in reality you should never be near them. Your argument is invalid.
---
I dont think you can. Just try making some other concepts but thinking how they could actually fit in the game. The more sense they make, the more likely they are to getting in the game.
---
Yeah, for Darryl your arguments make sense. He's pretty balanced if you know how to play him, I love Darryl. I don't think Mortis needs a buff exactly, but just modifications to change his playstyle to a wider range of things
---
I‚Äôm the global release tournaments I believe they did, but that‚Äôs all I can remember.
---
You mean lollipops?
---
I know, but it is somenthing else to complain about 
---
I personally think he‚Äôs fine, but at this point I guess it wouldn‚Äôt hurt to change him.

Also, it's not emulator.

App called Game Launcher provides game recorder which is quite surprising. :3
---
No, what's the point of leveling up then, n level advantage is supposed to help u get past the skill gap. 
---
No, that‚Äôs what variety of characters are for, each with different star abilities. 
---
I got only 1013
---
When Leon spawns beside u in showdown
---
This. I pulled him the other day but can‚Äôt play him for shit. 
---
No, matchmaking is fair according to trophies, levels don't really matter as long as u have enough skill. 
---
How about something like this:
---
A flower using brawler that throws seeds. If it lands on an enemy it will hurt them, If it lands on ground it will grow up to a fruit that heals one ally  brawler if it touches it. Each fruit is one-time heal only.
---
Heal shrooms can be a skin for him/her!
---
Alright hotshot, I want to see you use a level 1 Mortis with two other teammates at level 1, and go up against three level 10s with whatever character they are. Example, their team could be Leon, shelly, and bull. Send me a clip of you win that. 
---
Lmao after you said that, my next two matches had Leon beside me &gt;o&lt;
---
Oh. I was just having fun with this brawler Concept because making concepts are fun to me. I don't actually expect this concept to be in the game. I just make them just for fun üòÑ.
---
But I could try and make some brawler concepts that could fit in the game. But idk...
---
yeah, I was thinking kinda like spikes super with the spikes but it would be like a bush of flowers, and as a fun thing it would turn grass into flower patches with her/his super attack
---
Good ol‚Äô days when bo was special 
---
Congrats man!
---
Me: oof a primos really close to me I should run! Quick there's a one block gap
---
Joystick: pointing straight at gap but brawler moves to the left then to the right
---
But then primo catches up and kills you
---
The matchmaking system is based on each team player's brawler trophies, well, that would be right if it worked.
---

i don't understand why you posted the picture with weird orientation

You forgot teaming in solo showdown
---
Lol funny, I said this and got downvoted so here's an upvote before they come in
---
be logical and polite dear... especially against the company itself
---
And before you guys say this is fake, no it‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs because I‚Äôm playing at less than 100 trophy range
---
Yeah OP's bad use of math doesn't really work. It's easier to say something like 'brock' is a play on words with 'rocket' (and also perhaps a homage to *the rock*) rather than -er +b +who gives a shit -üÖ±Ô∏è

I do understand why people hate teaming but it doesnt ruin the game for me.

Stop whining kids it wouldn't be fair even to play with bots for you noobs

gang star vs. it just works

They have same attack, but different power. The star power is when he become zombie the attack will be faster like piper star power speed

Very nice, god job!

Mortis no hat skin, because hat Mortis is the normal skin

Dam scouter must be broken (just like matchmaking)

In my opinion, It was definitely better than Hot Maze. It was possible to play with many other Brawlers, even with teaming, It wasn't that hard to get trophies there. Now Hot Maze is shit

Everyone's motivation in gem grab

Piper star power attack speed ü§¶
---
Do you mean projectile speed? Attack speed means how fast you can unload an attack after the other one. So basically reload speed. Projectile speed means how fast the shoot goes. And even if you mean that you are wrong, please at least take a look at piper's star power (deal 400 more damage at max range if you are inside a bush)
---
But the brawler idea is pretty good, i feel like the zombie should have a melee attack but yours is good too 
---
Did I suicide correctly? 
---
Seems like regular volleyball, we need some damaging opponents too lol

I'm playing this game since It's release (not global release, beta release) I have my last brawler in May and ever since I'm missing all three Legendaries, do I the worst luck or yours????
---
Also do not we have 22 brawlers only in this game rn not 83
---
Let me guess your total trophies 500???
---
When you have a high enough amount of trophies and play competitive like me shelly, bull and el primo all suck, cuz everyone else teams with each other and takes down all the close range brawlers, you may call me ignorant but thats coming from the guy who has trouble with bulls camping when there is a simple solution, KEEP YOUR DISTANCE
---
What if you jump into a wall as primo and teleport
---
Yooo this is actually one of the best skins i have ever seen.
---
Because there are 50M of posts like this. They already know.w
---
You again? See my karma you fucking homeless cancer.

b√πt ƒ´ th√∏√ªght √ßh√¨√±√• w√§s thƒì sƒÅm√´ √°s ƒìv√´ry ƒÅs√¨√£√± √ß√≤√∫√±try
---
By your logic everyone will be able to push their brawlers to 800 trophies and then you'll have less players in lower level. Bush camping is a tactic too not an unfair way to win in the game.
---
This is why boss fight is garbage right now
---
That is so satisfying to watch
---
He says that because even tho matchmaking is based on brawler trophies, with time all of these limitations get smaller. Watch Kairos time's video about this. So basically any of these crazy team differences can happen to anyone. 
---
4 years and only 109 post karma impressive üò©ü§©
---
Well that is epic
---
I completely agree! 
---
It is an unfair way. You get more trophies for sitting in a bush than someone who fought very well but got killed. 
---
Holy fuck checking karma...you must be a really good freak lmao to care about karma on reddit. These kids...poor.
---
I can give you some money so that you can end up your month or buy some gems for you homeless cancer.
---
good.
---
You literally asked me to see your karma
---
Everyday of my life

Took a lot of effort because I'm not the best at drawing

Thrower type? Also does she get a full heal when using super? How strong is the slow(shelly star power and spike super slows 40 %)?

You can't blame me for using it. It's a good font
---
I think it could be changed and if you have any other ideas that would be great
---
Theres nothing more frustrating in this game than playing a Bounty mode with randoms and find out youve been teamed with a Bull and a Primo. It happened several times since the global. 
---
The random experience was bad in the beta, and has gotten much worse with these bull/primo mains newcomers.
---
Nope learn to understand english. Seems like you have to keep going school kid. I can give you some money for books so you can study.
---
this is my first and definitely not last brawl stars fanart. i really love this game's aesthetic and i'm having a blast playing it, too. um also i am just assuming that nsfw brawl stars content is not allowed to be posted directly here and i don't think there's a sub for it either. but if you're a degenerate like me i'm making some of that too - so if that's your thing then you can find it on my [lewd twitter](https://twitter.com/xtilxtil).
---
Waist*
---
thanks!
---
1000 trophy is nothing it's normal af to have 9 Brawler at 1000 trophies.
---
I mean, this way would mean that you really don't get anything unless you're first or second. Also "not fair to of players" is bullshit. Just because a system sucks and some people had to deal with it doesn't mean it shouldn't be changed.
---
Stop using aimbot hahaha, very good clip 
---
I have a note 8 and everything runs really well. The only issue I've faced is lag when playing on wifi, but that seems to be a problem everyone has. The game has a bit of a battery drain problem however. But from what I've read it seems to be  since the game went 3d that that has become an issue.
---
Poco pulled a little sneaky on ya
---
Dude I kill bull like 50-60% of the time when I run into him in the bushes. The problem is that if he's the first or second dude I run into, which is pretty common, then I can get like 9th even if I've already killed someone. Maybe a system basing trophies on kills would be more to your liking?
---
I think I might've been  that Leon, was this recorded like 3-5 days ago?
---
Can you still get out of there if let say the clouds hadn't appeared and you got your Super?
---
That makes you a teamer.
---
yeah, but if he has 2000 health and he uses his super, he will then have 4000 health and 200 shield.
---
Omg yes. The special shouldn't have the power up
---
Wait why? 
---
i meant 2000 shield
---
Maybe we could get a event modifier like this, but not in the real Showdown.
---
Oh ok i was confused üòÖ
---
Lol xD
---
I always thought Jessie is intended to sound like Engi, since the game describes her as an Engineer
---
It‚Äôs a flipping masterpiece
---
I agree
---
Wow!
---
Thanks :D
---
If I had some I would give you a platinum award
---
How many hours did this take you?
---
The middle is designed to be an open area that is easily accessed. With a random aspect, the end point could be a spot that‚Äôs over half covered in walls and can only be accessed through one side
---
Ok thx dude
---
Not that good because Mortis isn't really a good Boss... But, good time anyway
---
WellYouAreReallyLuckyIfYouFidntEvenCollectAny
---
I played 5 games with 15-20 tickets per time and got boss twice. #BossJessieOP
---
As much as teaming is hated, it is a very effective strategy to earn trophies in solo sd. All you have to do is play an innocent brawler that isn't melee and people will team and you won't lose trophies.
---
That's how mafia works
---
What are those legs?!?!? (Love the art tho)
---
This happened to my friend about two days before Christmas. I was opening some boxes earlier and reminded myself that he sent that pic in our group chat, and he‚Äôs only ever bought the level bundles :/
---
Why do you main penny instead of Jessie when Jessie has a better turret. No idea üòë
---
Me too. Lvl 50 and only now pulled my 3rd super rare (penny)
---
Pulled a Leon from one yesterday. So there goes my chances at the lottery. 
---
And if you don't play him a lot or hate his playstyle and just need trophy's, then you can play this and practice defense play. Which is important for other game modes, like gem grab, and bounty. When all you want to do is live, run, and hide with GEMS BECAUSE ITS HOW YOU WIN THAT MODE. Don't get salty because people are trying to win, while you lose trying to force this mode to be be some kind of skill trainer, as to fit your personal opinion of what this mode should be. This game mode is soooo simple. Live win. Die lose. The last people standing are right, and anyone who died on the way was wrong. 
---
Don't have any higher rarity brawlers though
---
Teaming a lot in this map I don‚Äôt want him back just he be different
---
If you‚Äôre asking about how to improve your drawing skills in general, start watching some tutorials for body proportions, or atleast how to draw the basic constructions first.
---
It will really help you draw the characters less awkwardly.
---
come on, she isn't that op as enemy, i've trolled her so many times. just act like u're coming and let her super
---
Break the wall with your super, hello?
---
Look at the video and evaluate how good he is in showdown. As for gem grab, he‚Äôs only good on one map, and that‚Äôs stone fort. Other maps are too open for bull to be used effectively. He‚Äôs only good in heist. 
---
:D
---
That's the point it's a timer for the closing to start
---
Thanks for the constructive reasoning. I agree on your part, Island invasion has a Flaw of big open centre in a map. And it was made in a way to have most brawlers get killed in bushes. Teamers took the Advantage of the Middle opening and for that I'd not blame anyone using Shotgunner or the map for the most case.
---
I don't even feel that bad, fck bush camping bulls. 
---
Not new but yeah
---
bow and arrow*
---
Then you have played the beta, i play since global release and i'm at 4000 trophies and my highest brawler is 7. Why should i know the levels when don't have any maxed brawler
---
You shouldve used the bandita skin
---
Prediction 100
---
Then you‚Äôre new here. 
---
B
---
Idk, it still shows you the tar power and what it does and especially W H A T I T I S
---
He has a faster speed so most likely you (as a crow) could get away from the brawler who's trying to kill you and by the time if it comes near you he would have his super charged and he'll jump away. Fair enough? If you're trying to hide somewhere to heal up he would keep chasing you to poison and oncw you have really low health he would jump on you and kill off. That doesn't mean you have no chances of Killing him but he's very dominant in this way.
---
Did i meet the threshold or something?
---
At 10k rn, missing both spike and Leon :(
---
I‚Äôd join, but school soon starts, and I don‚Äôt know if I can be on very often
---
I have 5,600 trophies in total and I have a bull with 450 trophies. My region is Spain. 
---
I got him 420 by a miracle, and has not playing with him has been months. Bush camping is not my style.
---
You needed to make a supercell account... now its to late
---
Before May 2018, Trophy Road didn't even existed. And It was possible to get all league reward brawlers from boxes.
---
Kill yourself please^^^^/s
---
Thus it wasn‚Äôt sarcastic
---
Ok thankyou
---
Timbard I'm surprised you think I'm in the wrong. You're the one being downright disrespectful.
---
You know you wouldn't be the one to have unlocked a new brawler at a trophy range between 8 and 10k. It should be matching you with people AROUND your trophy range, and their brawler's trophies. I know that it's impossible to always get people around your trophy range but system could've gave me at least one player that's more experienced than that 1k dude.
---
holy fudge lol
---
I would, but there are no good images on Google images or the wiki of it
---
Cool
---
The feels bro, that‚Äôs either scary unlucky, or you play too much. Probably both.
---
Yeah, I guess you're right. I wasn't as friendly as I should have been.
---
Like the "coding" site?
---
Maining would happen even harder
---
Umm So I guess you're probably getting matched in US region servers, Where teaming is Still very dominant above 250 trophies and you'll see lot of people teaming. I feel bad for you, I hope as global players catch up Teaming will fade off. 
---
good job!
---
I clicked it but I thought it was a gauge of some sort 
---

Or is it?!...

Nevermind I checked your comment on YouTube again and it is you...
---
Unless you changed your desctiption just because of this, but thats unlikely
---
No need to give proof, I believe you!
---
But that‚Äôs how it works so I mean it isn‚Äôt supposed to happen. Although they should fix the MM and make it so it doesn‚Äôt, it‚Äôs just how it will be forever or until they fix it. 
---
Thx üòä

Compared to colt ricochet doesn‚Äôt at all need a buff

She‚Äôs can be used in 4/6 game modes if you are good with her. It‚Äôs not an opinion she‚Äôs perfectly fine, and you should probably learn her play style before saying other wise.

101 upvote and only u cry about it. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø. Allmost dont like posts of kids. Better post somthing interesting. Nobody care about ur brawlers sry. U maybe got cool brawler but play with him normaly u no can.
---
Yes
---
AT LEAST YOU GOT ALMOST EVERY BRAWLER
---
NO HATTER ALERT
---
Welcome to the club, don‚Äôt expect much from supercell they still haven‚Äôt fixed the brawl ball ball hiding tactic
---
Hey what u should do is join a team if they spin first but u must betray ASAP like before anyone else dies so he loses maximum amount of trophies as punishment for team
---
He can be played well on any grassy maps, however seeing he was literally getting teamed on by the whole lobby, I don‚Äôt think this game would be an accurate representation of his capabilities.
---
Because molt is such an expert? He‚Äôs garbage. 
---
super looks like frank's, it would be cool if instead push back enemies
---
What are you talking about? Lol, My Piper is already 500 .
---
And i only said that not everyone thinks the same as you, stop crying here.
---
Hat
---
I dont belive he likes teaming either. You don‚Äôt team because you like it, you team because it‚Äôs easier to gain trophies
---
That team would be so stacked though
---
Prolly better than you? He‚Äôs been playing the game year before launch? But okay YOUR BETTER THAN YOUTUBER
---
yooo this is a good idea
---
Good ideas but i have a few questions. So how does he throw his rocks? Like tara, like bo or like a shotgunner, or 3 right after each other in a single line? How does the targeting of his super work? An area around him, or a straight line in front of him, maybe an area he selects? What is this stoned status? Is it identical to stuns, or you become immune during the duration? What is his movement speed? 
---
yup
---
Moi aussi
---
No.
---
Its legit my favorite brawler, I love to play him. He‚Äôs my highest brawler and it was my second 500
---
Brawl Stars leg day just make every character have long legs. lol
---
^^^
---
Matchmaking was fair there. The level of brawlers are not considered, it would make upgrading your brawlers irrelevant. 
---
Ooo~ Thor would be pretty sick!
---
Teaming officially approved by Supercell.
---
Yep
---
Top hat mortis of course
---
Is it Matt?
---
Skin2Win
---
It's a megabox...
---
so ur just retarded
---
How long have you been playing?
---
Turn this into a tier list. kek
---
So he's only good in 2 maps and 1 mode. At his best was when the game was in portrait and there was no auto aim. At least then he stood a chance against shotgunners and before his nerfs, dashed great distances. What I'm suggesting is a minor buff that will make him more viable in more than thrower dependant showdown maps and brawl ball.

_Bounty_ - you kill players and your team gets stars for it. The team with more stars win. Your star value to the opponent's increase on how much you killed players. After you die your value resets back to 2. Hope this helps

Crow used to be the one legendary that everything wanted over spike. In June 2017, spike was extremely overpowered and Crow completely sucked (kinda like El primo today). But that was the only time spike was better than Crow other than now. Supercell buffed him ONCE in the summer of 2017, then they nerfed him so many times that eventually in around May 2018 he was equal to spike. He slowly went down and down. He is the beggar crow today 
---
I just got mortis and... I can relate
---
There is a way to counter this. When you‚Äôre completely outnumbered and you know you‚Äôre going to die, run into the poison so they don‚Äôt benefit from your power cubes. You‚Äôre basically countering them from the grave. üëçüèº
---
Oh i see. And so it would cross it coming back or try to avoid it? 
---
try to fill your super with someone that is peaking at a corner against you ... go to a nerby bush, use your super and go close to the enemy to hit all the stars and kill him, but be carefull to not get close enough to a shelly or bull
---
**This one's on the house**
---
Oh god you drew this???? Its amazing üò≤
---
Yup, exactly my point. Its not as annoying when you have someone like Poco who has consistent damage and can shoot thru boxes no problem, but it is annoying when you use someone with gun pellets, like Bull.
---
You heckin robophile stay away from Barley

wow. no need to be a dickhead

also the star power will be something new to control
---
Yes the controls start working all funny when you are near a wall! 
---
Not sure. Depends on how broke that would be. I obviously tried not to break the game with his mechanics since a lot of shenanigans can be had with the idea of a boomerang style attack. But I suppose that also depends heavily on whether or not he'd be considered a Thrower or not as well. I suppose the most logical result would be to have the Banana-rang attempt to return and then annihilate when it hits the nearest wall between it and Nanners.

This is epic

Any super you want wtf

The cousin, the champion, #1, has lots of meanings

bruh chill out. He's just stating his opinion
---
And you have no more things to say. You repeat saying you don't need to know how to play a Brawler to get 500 with them, i know.
---
And i said, if you get a Brawler to 500, you probably know this brawler very well, even though you don't know how to play with.
---
And when i said about Brawlers in 500, i waa refering to the fact you have experience with that Brawler, not skills.

I missed that day . It was one of the best update for sure. But they removed it cause tokens were like 15 every time. They could of made events where u can grind tokens or something
---
 
---
I am the "new" player who got crow. Cant really seem to get the real potential out of him except in the lifestee√∂ showdown. I would LOVE to play him more cause i like hes kit. 
---
I didn't want to copy Piper, Crow or Bo so I attempted to do something that felt true to his design that departed from mechanics that were already in the game.
---
It's the fucking BaBA YAGa
---
He was good earlier on. Really fun to play too. Too bad they ruined him this meta. Very few viable matchups
---
&gt;	Randomness is not competitive
---
I mean it works in Fortnite and PUBG. Also Hearthstone and Fifa are esports titles, randomness to some degree does not rule out a game from being competitive 
---
You motivated me to give him another try. After failing some more I kind got the hang(auto aim helped) and am LOVING him
---
We need to learn to aim manually, but when an enemy enters a bush and i fire shelly super to the nearby box.... üò§
---
Le-ow effort meme

#**YOULL SEE WHY YOU DONT MESS WITH JESS**
---
what if instead of curve shot, just straight up go through walls (but this will make him op)
---
true     
---
Yeah, its the most annoying with Brawlers who's bullets disappear when hitting a box.
---
I mean, I would accept people indirectly hinting at suggestive things, but WHY WOULD YOU DO IT TO B A R L E Y
---
Does crow not throw knives?
---
Kairos explained this: if you hit someone because of randomness you dont feel good because of yourself, and if you dont hit then you feel even more bad with randomness. I thibk Brawl stars should cometely avoid randomness. 
---
Lmao I have to repeat myself cause you still don‚Äôt understand what I‚Äôm trying to tell you. Reread this whole convo then type. You aren‚Äôt making sense anymore.
---
Grats to kairos :)

Bro chill I'm just kidding

Poor birb
---
I've been lucky enough to never come across such a huge party of teamers, I've only seen 2 people teaming. It sucks anyways of course.
---
Yeah ig
---
first of all i totally disagree that the shotgunners where bad. in my opinion no brawler or to be specific, Brawl Stars don't need Auto-Aim at all. a bad player will always be a bad player in this game and AA only ruins the game for better casuals who get one shot by the 9 bulls hiding in bushes in showdown because they will never be better if you only can do this tactic. you can't move better or "run away" better if someone is chasing you and spam the attack button. In Beta you could
---
If I remember correctly, you used to get tokens or whatever from brawl boxes. You used the tokens to buy ‚Äúpins‚Äù which were upgrades for damage, health, or super. You could also unlock pins from brawl boxes.
---
5,6, and 6 vs 6,5, and 10.
---
HAHAHAHA
---
Manage to do one so. It would look very funny
---
Yeah I understand that. Thanks for acknowledging that teaming removes the skill from the mode. What annoys me is how ppl act like showdown is super skill based
---
nice
---
5, 15, 25 and 35. There was a 5$ offer for Xmas

More viable in Brawl Ball? He‚Äôs already pretty much the best brawler in brawl ball if you know how to use him

I think it might be too hard for close range brawlers to get in
---
I believe it‚Äôs random, not 100% sure but the level 35 pack has appeared at least three times for me in the last month. 
---
Yes they reappear after a while, but they‚Äôre a one time purchase so you won‚Äôt see the offer again once you buy it. 
---
yes

I meant to say that he'll be more viable in more modes than just brawl ball

Unless your rich gem your account with mega boxes, otherwise buy token doublers in the shop and tickets, that alone can rack you up 100 boxes with ticket events 
---
They haven‚Äôt changed it in over a year. Nothing has been said if they will
---
No, u
---
All those players did the ol spinning in circle to signify they want to team in a solo showdown match. 
---
For the most part the community tries to discourage this behavior. 
---
Mortis is literally the easiest character in showdown tho. I pushed him to 300 without ever losing any trophies i think. You just need to avoid everything.
---
Sure it's better than nothing, but it doesn't make it worth my time to trophy push.
---
Exactly, u hit a box 4 times and then a bull goes hipity hopity your box is now my property
---
Levels aren‚Äôt too big a factor. Some people do Iron Man accounts where they push each brawler to a certain amount of trophies without upgrading their brawlers at all. 
---
They all teamed together. The OP did not.

Thank you for the help

@SaintFence do you see how creative and beautiful this game once was.....now its jus one button that upgrades your brawlersüò≠

I look back at these old vids in nostalgia....

If you don't see the easily identifiable shot land or fire, it's still obvious to tell as it lingers a lot longer and has larger flames that flicker more

I was so excited to unlock a new hero, and then I realized it was Darryl...

Yeah thanks for the tips and I do win games with him, especially in bounty, but I would prefer if he has a higher power level because all my other brawlers are around 5+ power
---
But you won't get anything anymore ever again so get gud
---
I don‚Äôt team and honestly I do pretty well
---
If it gets upvotes its what the people want I guess.

You don't need more aoe or damage, the fire rate is insane. That means more dps because of the constant dots of the ulti

Giving a worm would give him a big buff so no.

Why would you post it here, where EVERYONE hates teamers?
---
I guess it is because it is easier to new people to understand, like, if i said "rank 15" instead of 300+ trophies, most people would not know that you get rank 15 when you reach 300 trophies. And it is a bit more precise too.

Thats how mafia works

Maybe she can deal damage in health %, I've never seen something like that in a game. Obviously there are many ways you could go with this concept, such as dealing 60% of the enemies remaining health plus like 400 extra damage, the more you hit an enemy the less damage you will do, (unless they regency their health) making her more of a support weakening the enemies and allowing her teammates to pick up the kills, if this was the case I think she should have a really low reload speed. But the main idea is that she deal % damage the rest of the factors affecting it can be changed.

It varies from 3 months to weekly

can I take the second image and change it please cuz I imagine so much meme with that image x)
---
Shotgunnes become a lot less common because of teamers, however you can still find them on some maps
---
It's based on brawler trophies
---
Nah man, only OG's remember turret and bear hp decay.
---
He balanced to me
---
I know just saying this is dumb.
---
Pam is broken. Also really getting tired of seeing half the players as bull and el primo in every single showdown match. 
---
Penny‚Äôs turret is op, and Rico is ok but not versatile
---
Straight facts. The game has changed so much since day 1 
---
Penny doesn‚Äôt need a buff, are you crazy?
---
Ya same here 
---
and?
---
Wish he wasn't cringy as hell, because there are not a lot of brawl stars channels on youtube.
---
penny can't hit anyone with her turret. you can ignore it and you still wont get hit.
---
I laughed so it was enough effort for me. Dumb bot
---
Yep üëç
---
How do you even run? I find it so hard.
---
If you stop or try to backtrack it fucks you over
---
I know man, I was joking
---
Like in the trailer video lol
---
Are you tilted by any chance? They might be bots

You don‚Äôt know how to use word ‚Äúunless‚Äù

what about gay pride? 
---
Youre right you just have to spend a lot of money on the game till you all get the legendaries and use a sqaud of op legendaries...hm. ya not a top player just being cheap
---
it can also be easily destroyed, and has a very slow fire rate, and has to target 3 different people at once.

It‚Äôs my first time, I have the right to be proud of my accomplishment

Not neccesarely. When you use your super to create a mirror clone, you need a way to be able to swap with your clone, even if it's just once. So whenever your Super (clone) is active, you can re-press the button (without recharging) to swap, just once, with your clone. 
---
So it could either be that the Super recharges after your clone is gone again or after you swapped with your clone, once. 
---
Bullshit
---
Eh I don't feel the whole Leon thing yet..granted I'm not playong on high level but he's not scaring me in bounty for at all..Brock and Piper are real problems there. 
---
Nah pins were better
---
Ye it happened to me too. Was playing showdown. Finished it, so I start a new one. But the game takes too long. So I close the app and enter. Press play. Realize I was automatically put to gem grab. Press exit. Nothing. But the game is loading again for too long, so I think to myself I can close and reopen it again. When I come back, I press on showdown, this time wait patiently, and I finally get put in a showdown match. Not even 20 seconds in, that the game loads, and I find myself in a gem grab match. I hopefully won that. But obviously, I lost the showdown
---
Definitely Morris range lol
---
You can roll out but usually it spits you through one of the walls in the corners stranger things style. Getting actually stuck is a bug (I hope I'm not just repeating something super obvious)
---
o ya, that was a pain. But do you remember bull‚Äôs old voice when he charges?
