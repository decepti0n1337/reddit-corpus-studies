Vlw ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
---
That's ok I guess, but I would still just go for star powers on as many brawlers as possible. It means you have more options for power play, and having 2 star powers on one brawler is often not needed as you mostly will only use one of them anyway.

You didn‚Äôt miss it, he is in job theme lol that‚Äôs how inconsistent is your list. Witch and knights, costume? Not 1500‚Äôs theme?

Ah, Primos

Sad thruth : nobody cares
---
And u jinxed it

I had taken quite a break
---
They're releasing the Poco phone F2 next year
---
It is based off of total trophies, so if you search for a team with your highest brawler, your teammates brawlers will likely be much lower trophies.
---
I'm not OP, just did the sad math.
---
Sure I have 12k trophies my gamer tag is 20G8UJJU9

walter

They‚Äôre very easy to purchase accidentally

I know its so sad

Also santa spike

#***It's FREE REAL ESTATE***
---
The truth is the game was rigged from the start
---
Played with SpenLC, tom (the world champions) and drage in brawl ball once. I was quite lucky to face them at only 804 trophies but also unlucky because they destroyed us.
---
This feature is trash, worst think SC added in the game. 
---
I‚Äôm a regular player with 10 brawlers in rank 25+(not a lot but I like to play ‚Äúmore competitive ‚Äú), almost every random don‚Äôt have any brawler at +700.
---
In conclusion, youplay with randoms too but knowing what brawler are playing with. Also if u try to play with randoms without using this thing, you‚Äôre paired more often with teams with 2 players only, being one of them an underleveled or a 5 yo kid.
---
Sry for bad English btw
---
Is it just me, or does Mortis look much less...pale?
---
So, did something bad happen to him while EMZ was growing up, or did he just not get enough sun?
---
I only do it if its the only opportunity
---
No, I don‚Äôt YOU will
---
It would be better to see some actual game fixes
---
I have this problem a lot but it's me as a high trophy brawler. When I use a 700+ trophy brawler, it took me almost 10 minutes to find players and then matched me with 200+ trophy brawler. 
---
THE REASON IS NOBODY PLAYS THIS GAME MODE, IT'S SO DAMN HARD TO FIND PLAYERS. THIS GAME MODE REALLY SUCKS!!!
---
Yeah no, welp idk what to do now
---
Soo lemme see...Bo was an epic as well as mortis. Both Tara and Pams release was the first double brawler update. Piper was stupid broken when she first was released (one shot a Rico) and brawlstars went through so many game changing updates (currency, boxes, game names, rarity changes and style types)
---
Ahhhhhhhhhh
---
Then dont play mortis or thrower
---
lmao
---
That is what my friend's would (not actually) do.
---
Thanks for using my Template;)
---
Bruh
---
I‚Äôm just saying they tend to shoot at other ppl in takedown
---
Yes, someone that is not stupid
---
They should make a brawler unlockable at 17k
---
Thank You for using my Template;)
---
Also, Sandy Is A Girl should've been there too ;)
---
The cat and shotgun is shelly because she has a shotgun and her witch skin had a cat

What are u talking about?

Hey man. Thanks for commenting. You seem like a really nice guy and I was wondering if you could play with me. Random teammates haven‚Äôt been the best for me and I‚Äôm looking for a reliable person. Btw I‚Äôm at 9000 trophies.
---
You are right, but it is posible. Got gene on the first box
---
New emz remodel

How do you get this skin tommorrow? Is it free for anyone or for those who had ricochet before it was rico?

If Darryl didn't auto-aim the spike and instead prioritised the safe you would've lost, but i especially love your teammate's name, crowleon spike

Terrible idea

This reminds me of my friend getting Bea and Criw in a span of 7 boxes...
---
This is so accurate, have my upvote. And same goes with meele brawlers going against all ranged enemy team
---
I think it happens if you hit play again

P.S. im watching your posts to get less stressed

Thank you I hope you dont get band

On of Bibi‚Äôs voice line says ‚ÄúkonichiwaCK‚Äù
---
In Japanese, ‚Äúkonichiwa‚Äù means ‚Äúhow are you?‚Äù (I think) it‚Äôs a Japanese word for sure
---
Maybe... like a 1/1000 chance. They remodeled him already it would make more sense if it was a skin.
---
Are you saying that money should never be spent on entertainment and only saved up for essentials? That's not living. That is being a robot.
---
Has someone sparked some angry or bitterness within you? I thought it was obvious that p2p can be just as good as f2p. Brawl stars is very friendly when it comes to the balance of f2p and p2p. But in case you feel annoyed that someone thinks they are better then you because they are f2p, i will let you know that i appreciate the fact that you support a game like brawl stars.
---
How are you so sure?
---
That‚Äôs an awesome Christmas gift! üòÑ
---
Beware, long testimonial post incoming: 
---
  
---
As someone who has always paid (perhaps too much) on Supercell games, I must admit there is a lot of truth in this picture. First of all, I'm 28 years old and have no children (yet), so I often find myself able to buy gems here and there to give myself a boost or shortcut a way to a new brawler, perhaps just get that skin. Others pay for hobbies too, these games are one of mine.  But I've been on the other side of that medal when I was 12 years old growing up and barely getting a membership for RuneScape. It must be pretty hard to be a kid nowadays with a lot of games basically running the micro-transation train.   
---
Never forget: every P2Per understands the hardship of people who do not have that luxury. I don't think most people who are really a fan of any SC or other game with MTX are F2P by choice, unless it is on an alt account. P2Pers should not judge F2Pers for being unable to buy progress, as F2P should definitely not claim to be superior due to being pure. The fact is that games like BS are primarily made to have people spending on them, they are grindy to allow for people to do it a lot and the money they generate is the main reason why the games get developed in the first place. If everyone was (able to remain) F2P, the game would simply be changed to force people into paying which might very well be its' cause for death too. It is actually nice that both routes can be walked and both should be respected really.   
---
PS: As I have the luxury for spending, I really enjoy sharing too. That is why, during my years on CoC, CR &amp; BS I have met several youngsters purely F2P in my clans of whom I ended up contacting the parents to ask if it was okay if I gave them a iTunes/Google play card. You can guess, they are all surprised a 28yo with a law degree plays something like BS, but at the same time like that I'm somewhat providing some parental control in their behavior. Most of them did not know that these games are heavily focused on tempting youngsters into MTX but that their kids have shown self-control not to take the money and spend, and could enjoy having a little boost in their progress. The majority didn't know either that gaming is actually a better activity than watching TV as it stimulates focus/attention for detail/motoric skills.
---
Niceeee
---
Some people just insult those who pay money for BS. Im just calling those people out, not all f2p's. You are 100% correct.
---
I didn't get it either ‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
Why
---
Note my edit. It‚Äôs not just if you spent money, it‚Äôs how leveled up your brawlers are. Bs is really good at letting players who grind have the same advantage as p2w players.
---
Why not both??
---

I am confusion

There needs to be a way to "prefer" to be big brawler or normal brawler before matchmaking. But it might make matchmaking take longer if more people want to be the big brawler...

15,8k at the moment. At this level Shelly is only played by bullies with low self esteem, and of course they have star power. Thanks to their super they just charge at you and playing Eg. El Primo is useless. boom, boom, boom.

Yes, super is really broken. Recharge on every hit is close to ridiculous.

I think the only reason she is kept that way is that she is the lowest learning curve brawler and these things are useful in the beginning of the game.

You look like you need to be shooked

No i love white crow

He's perfect at 80

don't forget that he will get a whole new model

Because of the slow rockets that he shoots. But autoaim at close range.
---
***add a comment.***
---
Looks like someone got mad
---
I only buy gems to buy skins so I guess that's the grey area between being a gemmer and f2p
---
he will get a new model (with name change) when crow gets his remodel
---
Look at the kids account, he‚Äôs clearly a child. All his posts and comments are so stupid it‚Äôs funny.

How? lol

What brawlers hard-counter Rico? Asking for a friend.

How is it cursed?

Its not Alabama

You were just nae nae‚Äôd

Wut? I only see the new model of bo....and btw there isnt the older/newer model (cant difference them) but this isnt a big thing.. Its a great artwork and thats it.
---
Yea because he's a child

Actually I feel the same, take down is OK though, it just the spawn and boss charging make it sucks.

**hol up**

So does bea have a high winrate or emz

this is a meme

and it didnt made me forcefully exhale

funny

didnt laugh

But im 2019 :(, I know who ricochet is
---
I know and also because of other things
---
No need to say
---
I was thinking about buying Bandita but i gotta save gems for any new brawler offer (i only miss spike,sandy and Max,but i won't buy Max cuz she's only for support and not a great brawler for dmg overall,maybe i'll buy her to make my legendary chance rise)

THICCOCHET

You on the brawl stars amino?
---
If there is game center. No problem
---
Ok ZOOMER
---
That means they are ready to be level nine.
---
To be honest it's better they didn't remove Rico but add ricochet as a skin because then we can decide which one we like and everyone can be happy especially me who hasn't got Rico yet...
---
That's a great way to spend your gems, by not spending it unless some premium offer or excellent deal arrives
---
Or basically, just save it for rainy days I guess

You are correct, however, many of these f2p players were talking down on those who paid for in game contents, so yes.

‚ÄúDon't worry at all my fellow Brawler because we are aware of this and the good news is that our game team has already solved this and made sure that you can play the game normally again. Currently, they have fixed it and all you need to do is download the optional update that was released.‚Äù

Same maybe its trophy range what is ur trophy range

Ricochet skin is much better than the mega box
---
Penny would be super op on this map
---

---
10.800
---
I a, speed
---
Maybe im at 15k and i got it so maybe 10k and up gwt this deal its either that or player level
---
DUDE WTF
---
I have always paid for things in Supercell games. I get the pass Royale and the gold pass on cr and COC respectively. I just today got that Christmas offer in Brawl Stars. (Got one of Sandy's Star Powers and Got Max -no I didn't pay for Sandy he came in a normal box-)
---
Anyway- I buy things in these games because I love them and I am committed to them.
---
Yeah but maybe they can gift us with a skin of rosa, pam, tick, bibi... no a skin of a brawler who has 3 skins
---
Ricochets. Together. Strong.
---
Yes..buy it
---
That's a 5v5 heist mode who the back safe have more hp and the in front safes have normal hp.
---
It would be a ticket gamemode
---
Tick
---
Dont team
---
you mean og ricochet? well, sadly he isn't coming back of course
---
Content furat
---
Darryl and Rico
---
Get the legendaries my boy
---
.......uhh.......I'm broke AF
---
I feel like not adding Gene to this was a missed opportunity.
---
i love how they gave OG ricochet as a free skin, basically old rico except improved
---
üòÇ
---
Are you ready kids?
---
That or OP is gay
---
4 people liked his comment
---
There's no question, Chet is the answer to all
---
LOLOLOOLLOLL 69 NICE AHAHAHAHAH
---
It's only available for one week. Super exclusive
---
I only want one cuz i already have leon and spike i want one of the brawlers and then get all the brawlidays skin
---
#AYEAYE, CAPTAIN!!!!!!
---
Crow. He's really strong
---
Cheeeet dude , all the day ! :)   
---
Rico sucks !
---
Yo this Is so *cool*
---
Already did
---
Hmm .. very interesting ... well done !
---
Thats the spirit
---

---
Dynamike is a Anime Harem Protagonist
---
Meanwhile me: *Uses Popcorn Rico*
---
No one talks about Popcorn Rico üò≠
---
Thanks :3
---
Have you considered that my pp is bigger than yours because I pay though? It is true. Those of us who pay for the brawl stars do have statistically larger pps.
---
Thankies :)
---
*Laughs in Loaded Rico*
---
I did but I broke my phone and stupidly forgot the password to may gmail
---
The 'HACKS'
---
Time to break someones niko niko kneecaps
---
I totalllllly agree !   
---
Why did they create such a bad skin ? maybe ... for the people who don't like black .. ( no racism btw . )
---
I am pts. Pay to skin bb ;)
---
this makes more sense
---
I knew he had to do some art about it soon!
---
Guess you've never been on 900+ where there are 8 Bos teaming in the middle
---
The anchor isn‚Äôt really visible in-game. It looks like his regular pickaxe
---
You're welcome friend , and I wish you a merry christams and happy holidays :3 .
---
It's a bigger Ricochet
---
I don't know....i love new rico now tho ...first time i saw his remodel i was screaming to DEATH but now if ricochet will come back same reaction so...ill go for no chet
---
Then who is for mortisss!!!! I'm sooo done!
---
You must be fucking joking
---
chet all the way
---
awww bigger thanks :D. You too merry Christmas :)
---
Cheers bought the offer with the 6 mega boxes got Max and Leon's starpower
---
rico is piper's guard and not lover
---
Yess , I was so happy when I saw him standing right there , to be unlocked !   
---
I like Ricochet so much :3 . One of the best skins and brawlers in the game .
---
Not literally every.
---
Can't you edit it in with layers in gimp?
---
Get crow he is cheapest
---
Hmm ... yeah Ricochet is with Piper confirmed..
---
Is a skin for the OG players you will not understand, we asked for something like this for maybe 7 months
---
_my bois back_
---
Wtf is bos
---
Russian named guy who didn't use him: -_-
---
Clearly better
---
Then you are not a man
---
Barley case should look like xxx bottle
---
Agree
---
hmmn yes
---
I've been told that was mistletoe. But IDK, go ahead.
---
Yo wtf??? Rico spitting straight faxs  üò≥üò≥üò≥
---
Not stressing doe he just faxing üòé
---
No, that's Golden Mecha Colt
---
Not disrespecting the art, just asking a question
---
Cause im tired of this jokes.
---
I didn't get to play the old ricochet sadly but i started playing a few days after global release
---
Ah yes men with culture
---
Kill yourself
---
Dude its real..
---
You can't. Bots become agro after some time and will run at the safe ignoring you.
---
ELLLLLLLL SUPERC
---
I thought they were wires?
---
Oh, that's gotta hurt! (Ik I am not Colt)
---
In mine store happened the same but with crow instead of spike, so mine # is #birddiscrimination
---
Look closer there is a butterfly logo there
---
To fix it
---
No.I mean
---
It‚Äôs Ricochet. Not Rico...
---
Pretty sure those are wires.
---
Nope.
---
I personally think my trophy count is too low.
---
Why is the arrow pointing nowhere near where u wanted us to see, genius
---
its a discount dumbass
---
Exactly
---
+, that is broken wires.
---
same thing to arcade 8-bit
---
Any Idea why this offer isn't appearing for me?
---
Ok p2w junkie
---
This is why i love nita
---
You get the point...but yea you're right
---
&gt;why would you buy something that not gonna help you in the real world. But you guys keep this game alive, thank you
---
In that logic, u r saying buying cinema tickets, films , video games ( overwatch, pubg , etc ...) and alot of other things we buy for entertaitment is also dumb witch is not true at all.
---
In a full year you only got like 30 trophies?
---
Ok is murder
---
Did you get him
---
New BETTER
---
what about old brock, it seems like a pretty cool model
---
Washing my eyes with holy water
---
I fell like this is some kind of "ok boomer" hoke
---
whoms'd've'nt?
---
Wiresssss
---
I had rico 1/2 yrs ago tho. I‚Äôm f2p since beta and still don‚Äôt have too many brawlers
---
Ok guys sorry I made a spellling mistake so shhhhhh.....
---
Wdym its not a spoiler its literally the definition of a spoiler just cause its everywhere doesnt mean its on the spoiler. When avengers infinity war cae out my entire school was telling everyone who hadnt watched that iron man died but that doesnt make it not a spoiler if they couldnt prevent it.
---
No, mythics cost 350 and legendaries cost 700 but Crow is on discount
---
I mean Piper deserves that title too
---
omg a meme without Rico :0
---
Thanks for using my teamplate!
---
Because it was meant for crow
---
Still miss the old one

ok
---
I mean, skins are just cosmetics, they don't change the game you play, it's your choice.
---
he is just piper's guard
---
I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd need it
---
I just explained it though. The Poco and the El Primo are in same team, they are in game friends and you were the unlucky random. You can have 1250 trophies on a brawler and get a random with 0 trophies when he plays in a team with the third random.
---
Great artwork, very unique style ;)

You lucky son of a b
---
Wtf

ONE. AND. ONLY.

Ok ok ok ....... I remember..... But didn't u knew that both Marcus n that girl were both robots.....

Awesome..

Guys how do u get the brawler icon after your username
---
I started 5 days latter of getting Star Shelly :/

thanks :3

I think Rico is piper's bodyguard.....

GUESS WHOS BACK

No Chet all the way

Same problem

why would a girl marry a robot?

# ANGRY BO FIRST STARPOWER NOISES

tf you mean, you should be happy they gave back the old skin!
---
idk i like playinng on big devices and it is easier to carry with handle
---
What did you win? Was there's a thing to won?
---
I feel like one of the reasons I never played old Rico was because he just #looked weak
---
Stfu
---
I think is like his guard
---
ok zoomer
---
True that, they must be in the same club not friends, well anyways thanks.
---
Upvote
---
I bought it but my money is gone and no reward
---
Better would be reload to 2,2
---
It really is, the revenge feels good
---
Cool
---
i got him from the supercell shop. but it is closed now. :(
---
I noticed one of these... :( 
---
 So here take this... :D
---
I‚Äôll personally drop you a plat award if I get a cavern churn map of all rico
---
So it didn't give you anything like a glitch?
---
I bought popcorn rico for 69 gems too ._.
---
I want to rip out his guts and tie them to his head . So dumb and ungrateful . I think he should just quit the game so supercell doesn‚Äôt have to put up with his bullshit
---
F2p is better
---
Begging ain't a way of getting in

Uhm what

It‚Äôs beautiful (;

SUCKA blyat

Rico has nothing to do with piper
---
That is true, but still people likes that model
---
For what?

Joseph Stalin

Nah buckaroo it ain't cursed enough..

Pff

As a gift it may then be able to be bought for probably 80 gems

It literally does

Well that ruins the whole point of the map

Carl fucking drowns as Colt watches.

no

thank you so much for this post

looks like a rockwall brawl x skull creek
---
Joseph stal- how did u know
---
What if ricochet was actually a cyborg?
---
Then it would make sense since he's human and not actually a robot
---
Weeeell yes, but actually n- Ok, to be honest, yeah..

I know OG

Why everybody sleeping on my boy Wizard Barley?

---
Non avevo voglia di tradurre quel giorno :s
---
If you're suggesting that Rico originally had male testicles but had to undergo some Stroheim German Science Modification to full robot, then yeah, that might work
---
Nice, but that's not a skin
---
You like ganes too?
---
I saw this post twice before I got the reference. Aaaaa
---
You gave it count :))
---
I love loaded Rico, but you can‚Äôt beat my nostalgia
---
Guess their offspring will have semi-metallic skin then, I love snacks..
---
Question.. why do people cover there names in many post in this subreddit ‡≤†_‡≤†..
---
Yaaaaaaa
---
Dani posted that it will be gone forever
---
Yea but its limited edition i cant ever get it again :(

yeah i use Rico because everyone who uses the new rico thinks there like an OG or something

Explain please

you get a downvote for being so stupid

Your storage was hella full bro

Paul, the guy that made the concept did the red line, but the guy who made the texture didn't added It.

Ok..but snake praire has a total of 49 tiles with nothing in the middle + 14 tiles with nothing on both spawn points each.

A total of 77 tiles without bushes. (Not counting walls)

This rework has a total of 15 tiles without bushes (again, not counting walls.)

But ok

No what?

But in heist tho... Throwers dominate!

there are 2 differents offers today,tomorrow too and the 26th as well

and the best thing is they unlocked shelly for free
---
Yes! They should!
---
It still makes no sence
---
Got 2 legendarys out that offer worth it üòÇ
---
It‚Äôs because the Rico was in a team with the penny, and you just got unlucky to be matched up with them. I‚Äôve gotten matched with a guy at 0 trophies before (I‚Äôm @15k). It‚Äôs extremely annoying lol.
---
extremely good fanart
---
This art is great
---
I am F2P. I honestly didn‚Äôt know that there was controversy between F2P and P2P players, but I guess there is. Anyways, I don‚Äôt have the money to be paying for video games, so I do have to play all the free stuff and I get behind in the games that allow you to pay for progress. It is a little bit annoying, but I understand that developers need to make money for them to make a game. So I don‚Äôt get mad when something costs money. 
---
Plus, video games are a hobby. If I got mad at people who pay money for progress in video games, it‚Äôs like getting mad at someone who gets a higher quality yarn for knitting. It just doesn‚Äôt make sense to me.
---
Super: am I a joke to you
---
French Noices
---
Thought that was a perc
---
Its happend. Thank you Supercell for a Ricochetskin. I hope you are happy too
---
I guess bc they are both snipers in some way. But not just the community ship them (Piper's butterfly on Ricochet, mistletoe on the pirate ship etc)
---
emz is also a good brawler in this map, i swear
---
You know my secret now
---
As r/thatHappened as it sounds, I‚Äôd been on a major grind to catch up with a friend of mine who introduced me to the game. Thanksgiving break helped the most lol
---
Old Mortis is just worse quality Mortis. I would not buy the old Dynamike skin cuz we have better options for him. Brock is ok.
---
when my friends watch me from window before halloween
---
 I Would like the new OG skin
---
To me, you are already OG if you started before 12th  December 2018.
---
it doesn't suck; its just when i play showdown i had a rico as my partner for like 20 games, and half of them weren't even good w rico and j using the skin smh
---
I agree, the only problem is you can't have kids with bots
---
YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

Here, luigi can help u

I doubt a woman could just scratch a hunk of metal

They should add a Carl b skin (cardi b)
---
I have star shelly
---
On my old account

im og and no legendaries reeee supercell if u dont give im going to play dynamike.
---
Horny teenagers will always find a way

Are you mad because he isn't expensive enough? like you want him to be more expensive?

not the glitch, in beta mortis was really good in robo rumble

We have a skeleton that heal/damage people with music, vampires who attack with shovels and popstar zombies, is it hard to believe that a human could be together with a robot
---
I had 9 minutes :(
---
Stand can have a little salami
---
Cool art
---
Thats fair but people who support games from the start tend to be more invested in the game, and actually do deserve more credit because of how community oriented the game is, much of the supercell staff are on social media gathering information based on us and our opinions, so the og players influenced the game to the way that it is today. Thank you for reading this and thank you for coming to my ted talk
---
You ruined it &gt;:(
---
Which is his mobility. You can use his attacks to dash and stay mobile.
---
They were women in the 1920‚Äôs who rebelled against the norm of being a typical housewife and caretaker. They usually partied, went to clubs, and just didn‚Äôt do things a lady in the ‚Äò20s would normally do
---
Lmao
---
You should go for rank 35 too, nice job bro
---
Ok thanks .
---
Yeet
---
the x should be black regardless of that im very happy we got him back
---
Being an OG doesn't mean You are good or important
---
I would but Max is really underpowered in her current state. She needs a buff ASAP
---
Ok
---
the fact penny is staring at brock and brock notices make me laugh af
---
Probably because they dont buy brawlers at all unless they earned the gems from boxes
---
"Wait! Dynamike! Tick!"
---
"I don't think this guy's an enemy."
---
AGreatUsename u tot there
---
It's draw in spanish
---
Then we should label nobody. For some people like me, it cares how long you‚Äôve been a member of something. For some people it doesn‚Äôt, like you. If we can‚Äôt label those people, why should we label people and give them prices for their knowledge? My point is, if we would scrap the term OG, we should scrap matches, games and even notes for a test. I know it is far fetched, but everybody has their own way of thinking and judging. And I think we should label people with OG. Merry Christmas!
---
#READY
---
Don't worry bro, if you don't get 'em from these boxes, you'll just increase the chance that they (or another brawler/Star Power) will pop up in another box
---
Just buff his damage to 1500 instead of 1260 at max power. That should be enough, he doesnt need any other buffs
---
At least F2P have a skin now.
---
Yes obviously people do deserve some credit for playing supporting the game through its development but my problem is where people draw the line and the value people place on being ‚ÄúOG‚Äù
---
I felt lucky having bea and max but that ... that is luck
---
You just got VECTORED
---
It is not mobility is the attack you imagine a Frank or a lion or a cousin with mortis recharge.
---
It‚Äôs fine, plus I bought crow with the gems because he was on sale for 349.
---
You have created what is possibly the most cursed comment chain in all of this sub
---
No it would be Pam
---
Nice
---
I was lucky enough to pull bea the day she came out lmao. If it makes you feel better I opened up 120 regular boxes the other day didn‚Äôt get max and not a single star power.
---
He looks better
---
Where is bo‚Äôs low model?
---
Bull should be FatScout
---
Leon should be Spy
---
God damn it Enyaba!
---
A ti na kolko si?
---
Snipin‚Äôa a good job mate
---
Once again I am confused about his super. He throws his axe, then becomes giant. Does his attack turn into the Nita bear slam, or whatever that is? Does that mean he automatically attacks whoever is closest? Or is this like a primo attack or like a Nita attack?
---
Also, if his super heals him for 7000 hp, and he charges his super by taking damage (????) doesn‚Äôt that mean he can always have his super up? Because by the time his super is dead, he will have charged another super?? If this is the case, most people would probably just run headfirst into everything and never have to worry about dodging or taking safer routes or hiding because taking damage will basically make him stronger.
---
If he can charge his super while his super is activated, then he is absolutely unstoppable. As a side note, if your English is not the best, then it would be nice to know, as some people actually have good English except they just spend 0 time fixing their mistakes and it comes off as nonsense.
---
His dingus may be covered in a soft silicon sheath. He may be fully functional.
---
Yare Yare, here to warn y'all of a potential BrawlStarsCactus comment
---
I'm an OG but I don't have 13:14 on team rumble because I didn't know about the bug lmao
---
Why didn‚Äôt you just reply to him?
---
I don‚Äôt think we shouldn‚Äôt use the term ‚ÄúOG‚Äù I just think sometimes people make to big of a deal about being ‚ÄúOG‚Äù
---
Classic 9 year old move
---
But Carl doesn't have footsteps
---
I got leon and max today!
---
Buy spike,he is the best legy and always a top 10 brawler
---
For the left picture I know that the buttons have changed place but anyway. :D
---
*^(#PR8L29YUU)*
---
wow he looks cool
---
Sure buddy
---
F2P players could always get skins in brawl stars. golden mecha bo and crow are the rarest skins in the game and u still can get them regardless if u pay money or not if u r skilled enough. there is also cheap star points skins and 30 gem skins anyone can afford without paying
---
Bruh stblackst is living stand
---
Jokes on you,i'm actually an OG (VPNs come in handy when people launch cool games only in 3 countrys)
---
Well yes but no
---
This skin was free but generally they want u to buy gems and if it‚Äôs for a skin and not for up ur brawler it‚Äôs ok because ur not necessary a p2w
---
He's the reason why they call him Ricochet, for the love and ecstasy they experience ricochets in their minds
---
Damn, that's gotta be some Stroheim German Engineerin' level of advanced capabilities
---
15 oOooOoOooOoOOo
---
Tick is a clockwork not a robot
---
5 digit player tag
---
True XD
---
How many brawlers do u have
---
People: i have opinion
---
Other people: U N L E A S H I N G U L T I M A T E P O W E R
---
I mean if your a 2018 player we did get a free skin called star shelly. So that guy must be a new player. Cause he might not know about it.

You can practice that with Mr. Bat

Not that I know of. Gg.

You sad I have 666 trophies in power play T&lt;T

SOOOOOOO LITLLE!!!!
---
Genial
---
He has fewer skins than
---
- Crow 
---
- Barley
---
And ties with
---
- Carl
---
- Colt
---
So at best, by that measure he‚Äôs Supercell‚Äôs third-favorite because at least he got his fifth before Carl or Colt did.

I'm not sure if colt is the best one to read a map, playing colt means less thinking, more blasting.
---
I was playing for 4 hours straight today, i earned 500 trophies and unlocked Emz
---
pray so its in 3 days, i believe the skin disappears in 7 days or so
---
Your bloodline will end with you for this sin.
---
OG skin is way better.
---
Golden Medalist Ricochet gang here :D
---
Jessie going through her Emo phase in the dark knight skin
---
What happened to  good  showdown maps
---
I mean you could have installed the game via an emulator and linked it to a supercell account if you cared that much about the skin.
---
The second last bastion üòÇ
---
Thanks dude
---
Where are the popcorn rico?
---
This is what rule 34 artist were waiting for xd
---
How did people play without coiled snake before it was added then? I played mortis a ton before he got the second star power. Try playing creepy harvest a bit more, you'd be surprised how many times you can actually 'get in' without coiled snake. Of course you need to play more passive that way and dodge more shots, but its not impossible. The main drawback of mortis is his missing damage, if he got a damage buff, perhaps you could use one of your dashes to reach weakened brawlers?
---
I'm australian so...
---
Leonard...
---
Or just play a character with better range...or health... or one that isn't crow.
---
Excellent work
---
i dont think so, while it is a whole different model, there are no new animations, amd the projectiles seem to be the same, if it ever came back (which i dont believe it will) its going to be probably 150 in the worst of the cases
---
Me too!
---
Let's hope your right haha!
---
free to play
---
That's subjective but you have a little bit of reason
---
So what is it with 13:14? Primo glitch i got that but why is the time limited?
---
me and about a hundred other people tried getting it a few months back in discord calls. still possible, just needs coordination. out of about 40 of us that participated, i think 6 got 8 minutes. you need a game where all 6 people are on your side and you have the boss be a mortis or rosa that continuously farms super to heal/shield to slow decay enough to reach 8 minutes.
---
indeed, a mindset like that is quite petty as well
---
I mean... he really is designed to pick off the leftovers of others battles.
---
Rico
---
The less cool Rico
---
There are two brawlers with more skins than Brock (Crow and Barley) and two more that tie with him (Carl and Colt), and several more brawlers that have only one less than Brock (Rico, Shelly, Nita, Bull, Jessie, Bo, Dynamike, Leon, Mortis). Broco having one more than the average number of skins isn‚Äôt anything unusual, it‚Äôs something that‚Äôs bound to happen unless Supercell‚Äôs making of skins is designed to give specific numbers to specific brawlers. If Supercell was aiming for anti-racism (which I doubt crossed their minds when making Brock skins), would they stop at 5?
---
i think the devs just thought nobody would make it there so they just made it so it gets cut off at 13:14
---

. this is the new environment
---
cool skin but actually he sucks
---
Btw, I have uploaded this during bs beta but decided to repost because barely anyone saw it
---
I also got laxy and didn't do the requested crow one

Put a NSFW tag please

cuz sandy is better XD

The last thing brawl stars needs is another 1 brawler title. Tara is the only "skirmisher", Gene is the only "Support", and I suppose you could argue no other brawler is "toxic assassin", but there are 2 other brawlers that are "assassin." Although he is a scavenger, the last thing we need is another 1 brawler title. Maybe they should change Gene to fighter and Tara to fighter idk.

---
I haven‚Äôt seen this
---
But that lore ment to say is there is a remodel
---
Not rly an og since you started playing 1 year after the game released
---
There‚Äôs a REALLY good deal in the shop today that can get you 350g and a lot more for 14$. It‚Äôs red so It‚Äôs hard to miss. Consider it.
---
I bought all 3 and i got them in order
---
Good bot

Doesn‚Äôt have to be free.

---
The Skin is basically ‚ÄúOld‚Äù Ricochet Thicco is Young Ricochet
---
We also already have this skin.
---
420 trophies nice
---
Extra life star power
---
No bibi is way taller than penny normaly
---
His old model was rather unpolished and just straight ugly in some ways.
---
white crow will not be a recolor anymore after remodel

yeah, and that remodel is rico 
---
rico is still there
---
rico is ricochet's newer model, but ricochet does still exist
---
Its true that she is taller bcz she is actually older than Penny.
---
Meteors ruin it
---
Ricochet

Seriously tho even Devolopers Shiping

 Ricochet √ó Piper

LoL I'm afaird We might see Half Robot Sniper dude If those stuff goes on like this :/

Great job!

welp looks like im never going to counter ricochet
---
I had this bug like 3 months ago, they cancelled my games and gave -23
---
Thanks for the positivity üòä
---
Yeah and ricochet is on a pirate ship right now
---
Creepy Harvest is better in maps with more walls and tighter spaces. That way, younhave the freedom to dash around without having to wait to charge his star power. Plus, the walls give him more cover.
---
As for damage output, to deal 4500 with his attacks combined means a lot of brawlers would be overpowered by Mortis really quick. And that wouldn't be any fun.
---
Yes FACTS
---
Poor crow
---
And ricochet come to town
---
I don't know him
---
If the Mortis is anything like the typical Mortis, he's dead.

My only issue is when a PAY2WIN player beats a F2P because they paid for higher levels, that's just bullshit especially since it would take a month or two of losing to P2WINs for F2P to get on even ground.

Also theres hella achievement behind not spending anything, it shows you grinded for everything you had instead of working irl

Why would I buy golden rico when I don't even like the skin in the first place? It's not even a good skin to me tbh

For your information bs is like 1 year or 1,5 if you playing beta
