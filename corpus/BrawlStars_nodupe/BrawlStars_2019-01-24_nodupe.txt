I don‚Äôt like the idea of another dashing assassin when there is already Mortis in this game. However, I can emphasize the assassin part with this skill:
---

---
Normal attack: Blade swipe: Santiago swings his blade, dealing high damage. The force is so strong that a gust of wind blows in front, dealing 25% of blade damage. (Unlike any other shot gunners, he only has 2 tiers of damage, but can still act like a shotgunner at close range, that makes up the assassin part)
---
Super: Santiago tosses his rapier in a straight line. Any enemy hit will be stunned. After the blade reaches max range or hits an enemy, gusts of winds blow around the blade, knocking back any enemy. Only the blade deals damage. (His super is very good at isolating targets, or even preventing enemies from running away by utilizing his super‚Äôs max range. I feel like this makes him a very good assassin).
---
Star power: Santiago can now cut bushes with any of his attacks, including his wind.
---

bull, you cant see him

Congratulaton you won against a leon (op) who had like 150 trophies more and you were playing bo (worst brawler)
---
I've been saying this since switch release!!!
---
For Poco
---
You can't see him
---
What about dynamike? 
---
Got a boyfriend
---
Sometimes the shop does that, it gives you just enough power points to upgrade a brawler

reuploaded because hopefully more people can see it

What do you mean? He spelled the brawler right ...

Hey I'm not disagreeing with you. The second Brawl Stars was launched globally, I basically stopped playing Clash Royale. I just miss the amount of good content in that sub. Don't get me wrong, there was still the normal amount of complaints and whining you get in other subs, but there were a lot of quality posts that talked strategy or showed little unknown interactions.
---
This sub is mostly memes.
---
this exposes the noobs.  Any noob says thanks and all vets say that this is dumb
---
Cool
---
Is it weird if I love this just because of the mustache 
---
u/brawlstars

it will be gone if you mean if you have more powerpoints then you need to upgrade a brawler to lvl 9  it wont be gone if you upgrade under  lvl 8

3.4k only piper and still no daeryll. Damn it
---
The moral is kinda just a bit of comic relief tbh. Just showing that out of 100 games of "lower level" play (100-150 trophies and not bush checking") 67 times out of 100 I died to a bull hiding in a bush. And this would be the same for any character. I couldve done it wish any brawler and had the same results more or less.

I was just thinking about this and you made it a reality! Very cool, would like to see every character.

Agreed! I love Rico. At first i thought he was just some crappy ripoff of Colt but the more i played the more i started to enjoy him. I still think he slightly under performs Colt but he has a uniqueness that makes up for it.
---
One buff i would like to see for this guy is when he initially fires his shots they seem a bit delayed when it comes out. I think if the starting bullets came out as you fired it would make a big difference.
---
this is harder to pull off if you are not playing against noobs

Even more rare than a legendary üòÇ

Your sound effects seem overused

Ladies and gentlemen we have ourselves a pre-global saver.

No she can‚Äôt lol.
---
But if you spawn right by the 6-8 boxes you get like 8 power ups right off the bat as dynamike
---
Remember, theres a fan art contest so after the art contest, the fan art will die down.
---
Oh man i feel you. Still missing Darryl, Pam, Frank and all legendaries, I reached 5k this morning
---
Shelly is so adorable! Amazing job my friend!
---
I find this usually happens when the players with the higher trophy/power level is on a losing streak, thus they are placed in a match up that is almost guaranteed to not fail based on statistics alone. Check your logs if you win after three consecutive losses in a row and you will see that pattern. But I do agree it sucks being on the butt end of that kind of match up. 
---
I agree, I was just pointing out that memes are slightly better on the spectrum as far as indicating game balance.
---
I personally don‚Äôt mind the fan-art. 
---
Thank you!
---
It's ok and really encouraged later on for you you main a brawlers, because the rest of your brawlers reflect your skill and your top reflects either effort/time or bad balancing.
---
I think the mods should remove reposted/low effort memes. I think its clogging upbthe sub.
---
Huh?

That‚Äôs average...

Sry dude, gotta team some day. I learned that when i struggle at rank 15

Darryl ain‚Äôt trash, you just gotta roll closer to opponents and auto-aim them so you get the most shots on an opponent. Just my opinion tho
---
Spike- always straight to the point. Bo- he's actuallyvhard to play. Idk
---
We need a 2fort map
---
He would be a very interesting brawler to play as and against.

I'll try and figure out some stats for him when i get home from work

Unless they‚Äôre close.

Flat maps work a lot better. A good map might be a payload map

That‚Äôs not bad.Good luck on getting Leon, he seems impossible

I mean i would join the discord n play with people who use mics and dont suck maybe we can play tho. WHo knows

Fuck mega boxes, they‚Äôre abolute full of shit

Remove piper, add Shelly

Would buy Jessie

2 years, lucky head start, wait for the rest of us 
---
Literally... the shit I say when I get matched with a crow.
---
If we banned all teamers, the player base would shrink massively, and Supercell will appear as a bunch of Nazis. Skull Creek does have a history of being a thrower‚Äôs shithole, so there isn‚Äôt muh you can do. Meanwhile, there are 4 other game modes you could be playing. Nobody teams in Duo Showdown
---
ill be honest i dont have either sadly so maybe
---
but I still think it would be really hard to survive
---
and i'd rather not play mortis on showdown too much just to counter throwers since he has no 1v1 potiential
---
and if I had leon I would not like to play him every showdown or risk losing trophies
---
I think it needs more foliage/cover and removal of the lakes near the gem mine.
---
I got matched with one on my time and they carried me up like 40 trophies
---
**This post was inspired by somebody, showing a video with cool little changes to the unlock screen and I can't seem to find it. So if anybody can link me the video and post, that would be awesome!**
---
I was thinking the unlock screen can be a more polished, such as instead of a rectangular box with some info in there, why not make it looked polished? I understand if they wanted to keep it simple but I think it would be a great polish.
---
I've made the box look a little bit more slick, along with a voice line playing once they are revealed.
---
And if it's a legendary, i would want there to be extra effects while the brawler is spinning.
---
Of course. I don't claim that it's the most efficient way to learn the game. But it can help you learn those specific skills.
---
Even if there are situations where teamers can use auto-aim, they must be mindful of who they'd hit, so it helps their awareness...
---
And by predicted movement I mean the small movements of the individual players, not the 'herd'...
---
Finally, you said it yourself, teamers learn to position to increase their competitiveness.
---
I got past Bo and Dynamike and waited to unlock them until I got Crow. It would be much better if they made it so you could collect rewards out of order. It wouldn‚Äôt even be that hard to do, either.
---
Super satisfying
---
Ok I only have the middle done so adding the cover now, bit thanks for the feedback
---
That would probably solve the teaming vs no teaming problem. Supercell should implement that.
---
Those lines of walls in the middle are temporary (easier to build)
---
When u have more time without getting a brawler the chances increment so don‚Äôt quit just be pacient üïî
---
Woooosh
---
nah what they did there was not cool
---
It‚Äôs a gamblers addiction technique.. almost all of my special offers after buying Leon are 1-5 gems over my actual gem count. If I was willing to spend the cash on a legendary (thanks Christmas!) then a good enough deal would get me to spend that extra dollar for the ‚Äúepic Brawlers‚Äù etc...
---
And if I‚Äôm willing to spend the dollar, there‚Äôs a good chance I‚Äôm going to spend more than the dollar.. 
---

Yeah I‚Äôm pretty sure I did too, when my bull was on a lower rank

Wait it had 3 name changes? What was the 2nd name?

So is normal just as fast as crow? And is super like super duper fast?

You're actually very ignorant and it's crazy how you're persistent on being wrong. Just search it up or make another post or something, beta players will answer and make you look stupid.

---
The thing with that is you can then bot collect any future rewards like boxes on the trophy road. Those boxes could be what is containing the brawler. 
---
That is until crack is nerfed after weed is unbanned from tournaments
---
That's not what I said. You don't learn how to play the game, you learn how to team. There's a very low risk factor, which causes the player to use safe strategies, and wait for others to do their work for them. You don't need to position yourself other than to optimally get cheap shots and avoid the center of the group, and players would learn awareness better if they weren't padded by the security teaming provides. Anything teaming teaches can be learned just as well, if not better, by not teaming, along with other skills like leading shots, following through, dealing with groups, and knowing when to run and when to attack. Teaming may have some merit, but it will never be close to as optimal from a learning standpoint as not teaming is. This, combined with the fact that it isn't fun, makes it only good for farming trophies. But if you're not good at the game and not having fun, what's the point?
---
But leon is thanos so....
---
He‚Äôs gorgeous oh my gosh-
---
My personal opinions are that Leon isn't extremely overpowered, if you play correctly against him he isn't a big threat in most game modes. Weaker brawlers like barley can still react fast enough to Leon's super to counter him or at least trade kills with him. He's a big threat at lower levels when people can't play against him, similar to other brawlers, but he's not the best at any mode like other brawlers. His DPS is very high especially up close but the tankier brawlers or high damage brawlers are still capable of stopping him. If he catches you off guard in modes like gem grab by yourself, then you'll likely die, but good team strategy can't shut hum down no problem.
---
Spent the same and have everything but the mythics and Spike!
---
Haha honestly I thought this was a meme! I‚Äôve never seen this happen before 
---
It was a lot better for competitive if you had little money to spend as you could customize your upgrading experience to have lots of attack or lots of damage. In my opinion it was easier, but to people who don‚Äôt care about the game it probably was complicated and harder...
---
What lol, do you even got some pics on the original ui fam üåö

---
I think the best solution to this would to make a speed difference between tanks and other characters. 
---
For example in showdown there is no reason to not play a tank. Bull can do about 2000 damage and has way more health but still can run the same speed as Nita? That makes no sense. 
---
This would allow the Fighter classes much more even with the tanks.

Lmao I remember 6 months ago when this sub was raging and asking supercell to remover auto-aim and now its gone to asking to improve auto aim. Lol
---
I have a level 10 shelly at 420 trophies and I was stucked in a losing streak and ended up with 360 trophies. I only started winning again after not using shelly for quite a while 
---
Perfect idea. But supercell doesnt care about reddit ideas. 
---
Mortis is spot om
---
Thats really well drawn. 
---
If we're talking raw efficiency, doubler is better. The 1000 token doubler special means you spend 50 gems for 1000 "free" tokens, a.k.a. 10 normal boxes, for 5 gems per normal box. The 109 gem double mega box is equivalent to 20 normal boxes, or 5.45 gems per normal box.
---
... But getting to open the two megas is way more fun than 1000 doubler tokens, so it's up to you.

"don't get sucked into the black hole!"
---
I don‚Äôt think Leon needs a nerf. He‚Äôs honestly not that hard to kill.
---
idk, was it? i though the bear was like a regular bear so i make it that way :/
---
That or hotmaze
---
those white dots are not her pupils lmao
---
I guess I'm still too dependent on auto-aim, because when I use Rico, I end up shooting the wrong way üòÇ I forget that his bullets bounce.
---
How was there elprimo in the picture
---
nice
---
kool
---
They should make it a 5v5 game mode 
---
Won't Farmer make more sense than villager
---
When you run straight to bull using brock
---
Yeah..
---
I‚Äôm not taking about with other people I mean your teammate. 
---
Can I redraw this in photoshop and post it? I will give you full credit.
---
Nice watermark you got there

Pipers be like

His secret ability is Berserker mode when he have 10 gems

But just the one in my team, the enemy piper got aim :(

Omg this is epic!

Where did you find the 3D models?

leon was a brawler suggestion in reddit

Niceüî•

When i see global players complaining about not getting any legendaries and have like 1000 trophies

I would know, I‚Äôve been playing since beta first launched. June 2017, that‚Äôs not two years...

Easiest was penny, dyna, and Pam. Hardest we‚Äôre rico, mort, and the absolute hardest was Darryl.
---
your english is great! keep up the good work, upvoted!
---
That still makes me laugh xD
---
True
---
welp..........you still draw better than me, btw it still a good sketch
---
the final leon did the right thing by staying in the poison
---
\*Gives him 5 dollars\* "Leon dosent deserve a nerf"
---
Yes...... and I like to level all my characters at the same time. I think Supercell knows because when going into solo with Darryl, i got matched with 6 Shellys, 2 Bulls and an El Primo. 
---
They are really trying to encourage me to buy boxes and level up to level the playing field when everyone is picking stronger brawlers /s
---
btw , im jk
---
It do
---
Yes, glad I'm not the only one experiencing all of this.
---
Origin stories maybe? Overwatch style
---
Yeah that makes sense. He would certainly be a map dependent brawler and I agree his super always seemed like a weak point. What if it was a hurricane that did 1000 damage but could also be doubled by piranhas and have ‚Äúpoison‚Äù with the star power. With swimming being a passive of course. Thanks!
---
Primo:9
---
Thank you &lt;3
---
Holy moly
---
I don't know. But "humor" doesn't make sense, there's no joke or something funny.
---
Nice Job
---
Thank you! &lt;3
---
I don‚Äôt have Crow or Leon. The only 2 missing. 
---
At my level I don‚Äôt see need for nerf Leon. 
---
jeff
---
It doesn't match based of total trophies
---
I don't see a flawed matchmaker, I see someone making excuses for a loss.
---
:)))))))))) i thought in 2024 but it's ok
---
Ok,i thought that it is just brawlers created over the all period
---
It‚Äôs the brawlers trophies not the total trophies 
---
Imo try making bo little smaller
---
what was your go to event for penny and dynamike?
---
Ik these 300 are noobs and make you hate the game 
---
I know but makes no sense
---
r/FuckYouKaren

LiTEraLY UnpLAYAble
---
Ah okay, thanks? But I'm pretty sure you can draw better than me :p so...
---
Barley no skill
---
Oh ok lol i also do that some times
---
almost looks like she‚Äôs flicking you off
---
I did not level most of my brawlers because I dont have enough gold
---
wtf is this shot...
---
Then how th you got so much power points i dont evena have any mythic or leon
---
Mega box 
---
Leon + Tara =
---
shantae? 'o'
---
It always happens
---
Choose a use flare on the side
---
Gz
---
Bro think practical it's best as u might give him nerf here n there and from remodel we will lose bo and get a new brawler we want new brawlers but without loosing old ones and think that u can't deploy mines at desired place he is going to be perfectly balanced and bo needs a buff at low level but needs nerf on high level so this was my best try.
---
Russians propably
---
They‚Äôre bots
---
what chill man? this a serious situation we got ourselves involved in
---
And what‚Äôs that situationüòÇ
---
Well I am playing since beta and somtimes i buy like 300 Crows for 1000 gold or something idk how many gold that costs
---
Nice 
---
Just yesterday I got an offer for 200 tara points, got her to lvl 8 lol
---
I mean, at least you get top 5, right?

Opana, russkiy,go vzaimnyu podpisku?
---
Great work!
---
Part two? (For the other brawlers)
---
I feel like it's going to be in February because of the tournament 
---
Yea I‚Äôm pretty sure 
---
Getting shelly to level 8 is pretty game changing, allows you to compete with close bulls in term of box farming, I have her to level 7 rn and it's impossible to rush the middle in shodown except if no one is there.

[NEW IDEA] Missions Season
---
Today I bring an idea for a casual mode to play Brawl, not to focus only on push and still win great rewards at the end of month!
---
Let's do it by steps:
---
* DAILY MISSIONS: Every day a new mission would appear in your Mission Lob and we would have 3 slots available to accumulate them (so far, similar to the Clash Royale).
---
* REWARDS OF THE MISSION:
---
¬†¬†¬†&gt;&gt; 1st (fixed): from 15 to 30 coins
---
¬†¬†¬†&gt;&gt; 2nd: 1 to 3 gems / tickets or 10 to 20 power points of the brawler from your quest (if he is already on lvl 9, you will win extra gems / tickets)
---
¬†¬†¬†&gt;&gt; 3rd: 1 CRYSTAL (missions on Saturdays and Sundays give 2). Save this concept for later!
---
* MISSION SEASON: Yes, the missions would have seasons. They would last 28 days (2 full seasons TROPHY ROAD). Each season would have a special prize (could be exclusive skins, special box, etc). We would enter the game every day to complete a mission, focused on a bigger prize at the end of the month!
---
* HOW TO GET THE SPECIAL PRIZE?
---
¬†¬†&gt;&gt;&gt; Remember the crystals? As soon as we could fill the 30 crystals of the bar, we would unlock the supreme prize (in the case of the concept, the skin of Dark Tara). The extra crystals captured would be converted into gems (so if we totaled 36 crystals per season in total we could take up to 6 bonus gems!)
---
What did you think? I worked all day on this concept, I hope you have a tan! Oh, and anyone who wants to visit my profile, I've done many other Brawlers concepts and improvements for better gameplay!
---
Funny fact: In the image I prepared, the player only managed to get 8 crystals and the mission season will end in 4 days :(
---
Goodbye Dark Tara!
---
I posted a part 2 just now
---
Check part two
---
Please make more for every brawler
---
Cool üòé 
---
Loool
---
Damn are those legs sexy! 
---
This kid said 'storm' instead of poison. Hes a fortnut
---
You are right in your thought. As a solution to  that "her shot is may be cloud."
---
Hes a barbarian barrel 
---
Brawl stars
---
That is just clever.
---
That primo was lagging. Don't you know? thats how someone moves when they're lagging
---
Violates T&amp;C...
---
awwww
---
lol its cause i was fighting the boss while tanking shots from jessie and crow
---
Nice skin!
---
Well...first make sure your grammar is correct and then start from there...
---
This is amazing! You should do one for penny.
---
HALLOWEEN GETTING TOO SEXY FOR KIDS??!!
---
That's hot. Aah that's hot.
---
The premise is a Primo builds up his super in the first wave or so and uses it to dive into a big block of "wall" tiles in a way that he is totally surrounded by them. The other two teammates defend for a few more waves, and then the robots stop moving altogether. I guess it's because the AI gets confused and is trying to figure out how to get to Primo.
---
Hopefully I worded that right. If you need me to elaborate on something lmk.
---
P.S. if you do get the opportunity to do the exploit, do NOT walk towards El Primo. This will cause the robots to start moving like normal again.
---
Thats cool! I love the brawlers in the background too!

I have the same thing too this happens to infinity display phones

Agreed. It's not needed because you should know who has the gems while playing
---
200 iq
---
I might 
---
Nice. Tara awps double doors
---
Come on supercell sees this as fair? Im not really one to talk about needing brawlers considering im a global drop player with everything but the legendaries but for the people for have been playing since well before global and into beta that still dont have it, its just not fair to them who have been waiting and some new guy just gets it from luck
---
Have you ever played el primo before
---
No. It's not. 
---
*EL PRIMOOO*
---
Jessie lookin' THICC as always
---
Very original did not see this meme 10 times 
---
10/10
---
Thanks!
---
Yea because of that the map is *OPEN* vault.
---
Yes I know but all I‚Äôm saying is that people would get mad because they thought you copied it. So maybe just draw it a bit different. But it still looks good
---
Ahaha gratz man!
---
Pam's ass tho....
---
Thank you! :)
---
Dynamike - he knows what will your exact position be in 3 seconds long before you even do
---
mano
---
For pocho 
---
Not really
---
Say I just got Spike- I wouldn't want to get put with players who have alot of experience on however they are BECAUSE I HAVE JO IDEA HOW TO PLAY SPIKE
---
My god, it's pathetic how sad players like you are. 
---
You look for any external excuse for why you lost wether it be team mates or a perfectly fine matchmaker because you'd rather do that than actually focus on self improvement.
---
Bruh  hasn‚Äôt seen this before I don‚Äôt spend my life on reddit
---
Is she single?
---

---
I like the concept, specially the ult! Maybe he could transform himself into a storm...
---
Saludos desde Argentina!
---
You're going to heaven
---
Bruh I‚Äôm just saying this one is good
---
No it‚Äôs an old brawler concept from when the game was sci-fi.
---
Its Clash Royale all over again.
---
I didn't see it
---
Someone stole it?
---
This one got 1k upvotes and al the other ones got what, 20?
---
It's good imo (I succ at drawing)
---
100% agreed.
---
Good bot
---
That bo one is too accurate
---
I don't think it needs it cuz' the game doesn't lag. at least on my phone.
---
This is so much cheaper than any other Supercell game and most other feremium games.  The gaming industry is in a terrible spot right now.  Any game you pay for and get full access to is total shit.  Once you buy the game the producing company has no incentive to make the game better.  The companies are incentivized to rush new games that are barely finished just to sell more copies and continue the cycle.  At least freemium game companies are incentivized to keep you playing and to make you like the game enough to spend money on it that you don't really have to spend.  In my opinion, freemium games are some of the best at the moment.
---
It means you are retired in the brain and are special needs
---
You must be really into the monster stuff
---
No longer working? Why are you talking about jobs? I think you mean retarded 
---
No...sorry. I suck playing as him. 
---
C:
---
This is very low effort sorry. Lots of low effort memes in this sub and 1% is useful content. I hope the mods will remove these low effort memes.
---
Thanks for telling him I was gonna do itüòÅüòÅ
---
It's happened to me too. So weird
---
Oh. I got Barley a long time ago, so I only received the skin, and didn‚Äôt know about that. Thanks for the knowledge, though.
---
So helpful üòÇüòÇüòÇ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
First time ive felt sorry for a leon. Probably the last time too.
---
I think Stecca could be refered to the stick used in biliard and cue sports, since the ball actually bounces on the wall, but the question still remains, **just why?**
---
  
---
Ricochet sound so much better tbh  
---
It says the luck only impacts the probability of the Legendary Brawlers. I don't believe the others change. For example. Mine are all the same as yours except my Legendary is 0.1344%.
---
It also says it will lower your luck percent for each brawler you get. Did you just get a Super Rare, Epic or Mythic? Those would drop your Legendary percent.
---
They make a Brawl Talk for every update 
---
I thought this meme was trash
---
Use V (uh oh) P (uh oh) N, helps me to 100% avoid lag. 
---
Some bot once deleted my thread for providing information on how to break supercell rules of terms... So I hope this will help
---
am i the only one that noticed that mortis is wearing the gastly gibus
---
Barley serving up drinks to Poco is a nice touch.
---
Non escape from bulls I see. 
---
Tbh it ruins the game how only certain brawlers can team, find it extremely hard to push my Shelly 
---
Leon hasent even been out a couple of months its been about a month and a half
---
Don‚Äôt let them charge their super. Barley in particular has a nasty one.
---
Force them into the direction of your teammates. They will dance behind a wall all game but try to position yourself so that they are exposed to your teammates, if that makes any sense. They can‚Äôt hide from all 3 of you.
---
Hopefully
---
300, 900, and 1600
---
I spend most of my game time as Barley, you get pretty good at leading shots after missing a ridiculous amount and starting to hate the game.
---
You still get some people who you'll never manage to hit because they're more evasive than a child who knows they did a bad
---
Bull would be terrible here imo. Every team comp would be piper Rico and bo
---
The most unfunny joke
---
rolling assasin
---
How is that unlucky?
---
Because I want Frank, not crow
---
9.2 k no legendary and f2p. 
---
Its good for progression, but since its overused in mobile games, i cant take that unless its completely revamped. It feels like every action mobile game has a mission system except for brawl stars atm posting this
---
ƒ∞ said rate my drawing you little blister
---
r/puns
---
If you play Leon as a rusher you‚Äôre gonna get clapped at 300+ trophies üòÇ
---
Most liked comment i will draw
---
not flexing but do you consider me lucky with 1 legendary (spike) and 19 chars at 6.9k?
---
I just hit 3000 and got Tara on Sunday and pan the week before
---
Bull obviously 
---
Free 1 Dollar
---
Jessie‚Äôs heaven
---
Nice skin piper is my only 500 so I really appreciate her getting fan art and love
---
No, it‚Äôs a bit lucky to have a legendary before all mythics but 19 at almost 7000 is not so lucky. And what‚Äôs your legendary drop rate? 
---
2 + 0 + 1 + 9 = 12
---
there are 22 brawlers
---
22 - 12 = 10
---
if we reverse 10 then it‚Äôs 01
---
01 is january
---
that means update comes in january 2020
---
Love these ! üòç
---
Oh I got Tara on level 1 to rank 11 but that's hot! 
---
*gasp* MY GAWD! 
---
The worst is all those post were you see one with 30 power cubes and they ask if anyone got any higher and just 2 post above them is an other post with 40 power cubes who asks the same thing. Everything above 50 power cubes is much you don't have to ask and everything below is not much
---
0.0096%
---
***Also, anyone knows how many power points can be earned from a double token full spent??? 
---
Oof, I‚Äôve gotten 0.19
---
Aww he doesn't have a bush to hide in that's sad :(
---
Bull is camping in a bush, and leon is nowhere to be seen
---
You should see my dick

Understandable

haha img onna sey the N word and you cun-t stop mem üòé
---
I'm scared
---
They can release skins weekly but ask for information on the actual game and they can‚Äôt deliver. It‚Äôs been a full month without an update or even a sneak peek
---
just like her mama
---
I said im always moving from bush to bush, not standing still. Besides, more example, lets say tho colt has much less hp, 300. I have full health. Why me, exactly?
---
or just devices 
---
Unlocking Dynamike will increase your odds of legendaries because you can climb more trophies and get slightly better season reset rewards. And you can get those one time rewards on ladder faster too!
---
I like this a lot
---
Can I dig it?
---
This is so basic.
---
This is awesome 
---
By the way they‚Äôre doing it , it seems like the next update is coming 2020 . 
---
It‚Äôs okay to to waste money on a video game so you could feel better about yourself
---
You dont have to redownload the game. Go to the settings (make sure you're logged with supercell ID), click to log out. Then choose "play without", finish the tutorial, go to settings and save your account with supercell ID (use different email than your main acc's one). Hope I helped ‚òÉÔ∏è
---
Is this supossed to be a joke?
---
Dark Tara is most powerful because she can say the n word
---
nah I mean it keeps popping up in my feed multiple times
---
This will give me ptsd
---
Where do you contact supercell like this? Twitter?
---
Well, I guess you could say Supercell can milk some money with this skin
---
I Know but the first days on the game not opened the boxes and I focused on the Shelly
---
This is so good!
---
Thanks for the tips on a map I might never play!
---
Oh thanks I didn't even notice the event name was written there
---
*EEELL PRIIMOOOO*
---
That never happens to me. If that is the case, avoid touching the wall.

you can contact with devs by help and support option in settings

Oof even better

emm then you are bad dyna sry i main dyna and dont have these kinds of problems jk if you didnt have dyna sp you screwed this save my butt too many times xd
---
That would work
---
Started playing casually last week. I'm at 2.5k trophies now and I'm actually feeling something is off.
---
I don't know what do people exactly mean with bad MM but this is my experience:
---
- MM based on single brawler trophies, but I think there's more to that, maybe do global trophies count too?
---
- I'm always the least powered up brawler. Maybe it's because I've started recently and struggling to get money to power up brawlers. I have like three at level 5 and the rest 3-4. I get opponents wjth brawlers at level 7-8 everytime.
---
- The game seems to have something scripted about making you lose. I'm an average player and as average I expect to have a win rate around 50%. Well, if I win a lot during one day, as soon as I quit and play after a few hours, I lose like 9/10 matches. This means at the end of the day my win rate is still around 50%, I gain trophies but my losing and winning gets consistent for hours.
---
Today I did 24 matches and lost 22. I swear I was playing decently. The opponents were just too good and always level 7/8.
---
Don't know if this is what makes MM bad of if there's more, since I'm new.
---
Can anyone confirm/add more to this? I"d like to understand more.
---
HA! I get it.
---
Pam was never thicc, she was just fat... this was probably when she was jessie‚Äôs height

Darryl- Only useful with star power.
---
And then come 5th and get 1 trophy
---
lol do a colt documentary 
---
For people who don‚Äôt get it: this is another Leon invis joke
---
And skate 4
---
Perpetually woke
---
I like this a lot, could be super frustrating with a quick team wipe and they get a score tho. I‚Äôd love to see some kind of CTF variant.
---
I quit the game long ago, but I know they added lots of cards since then
---
What rank is your darryl? In higher ranks he‚Äôs pretty bad... you probably only got kills cuz the leon didn‚Äôt see you and you killed ‚Äúweak‚Äù brawlers in close range like barley and brock
