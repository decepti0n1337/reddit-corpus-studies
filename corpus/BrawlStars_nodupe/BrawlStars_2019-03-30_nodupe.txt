The thing is i dont get any power points which is really frustrating. I get points for Leon/nita/shelly which are already power level 6-7 but Mortis? Nope. 
---
I'ts annoying yes, but the whole point of Showdown is to try and be the last one standing. Even if only one person isn't trying to kill you the whole match, you will still get chased by other people so... what's the difference?
---
to bad I don't have brawlstars üò≠

Can you count?

They had us in the first half 
---
I need that now

Yum

not even at the shop?

Right, theyre never ment to be of similar value

i got 6 powerpoints for mortis for free once.

What‚Äôs hell got to do with any of this? And send this video to help and support and see what they say.

So he tried to go away then he died lmao

You guys are just a bunch of sheep honestly you see a few people say he needs a buff and just follow along without knowing anything ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I would tell you not to but you might like it

Maybe a little

i was rank 15
---
Bro the people complaining that he needs a buff probably play super aggressive with him and expect not to die.. he doesn‚Äôt need a buff you guys just suck with him 
---
i posted not this graphic but the idea yesterday i agree that the first thing i thought when i saw this in the store and remember when they said the next update would be green Leon skin confirmed
---
Cory said shes the lowest skill cap
---
That too
---
The game need this

True lo l

His sheer ability to cop the bolts might be enough to make him worth it

Nah thats worse

Unsing piper in fest or famine tho....

It is.

üòÇprobably, I only play brawl ball for the box.

I see what you mean now, thanks, any ways on how to improve?

All he needs is a slight health buff but if you know how to play him he doesnt really need a buff.

People always complain about what they don't have instead being grateful for having something.

El Primo has the fastest or second fastest reload speed behind Frank so it makes sense

Sorry your trophy count will never be over 6k, let alone 10k, definitely never coming close to 12k.

Nah, teaming higher up is a big problem. Lost a 1v6

I think they rotate every 2-3 weeks. Hoping Leon comes back in the next few weeks.
---
What what
---
Dood you got 30 coins AND 20 star points for PENNY ?!?! I mean , WOW ... 
---
Maybe Supercell should add a free skin for Rico turning him into Ricochet for those who like Rico and Rocochet
---
Lol
---
I'm at 7k just playing casually... I don't even play much, you really don't need to be a dick for no reason
---
Nice! This is sick
---
Her bounce shit is Annoying af
---
No they play soccer too. Not as good as Dutch but not bad. You know very little, aka stupid lol
---
Yep
---
literally :0
---
Bro you used Showdown as an example and the only example. You have to think about all game modes not just 1
---
Crow is like piper good but only on specific game modes and maps in those game modes. 
---
If your good with crow then you‚Äôd know how to juke and play passively not aggressively which is how your meant to play him! Showdown isn‚Äôt his strongest game mode, like penny. What? So penny needs a buff now? (only one she needs is a star power rework) but no damage buff or anything. 
---
Now brock and colt are sharp shooters. Crow isn‚Äôt, he‚Äôs an assassin your not meant to stand out in the middle of the map attacking someone you needs walls, bushes etc. 
---
You can consistently win games with every brawler depending on their map and game mode + skill level of the user. Just because your not good with the brawler it doesn‚Äôt mean he needs a buff. Now their is a meta right now which means that their are some brawlers that are a bit op or really op like Pam for example who is at least ranked A+ in every game mode. But we‚Äôre not talking about a nerf for her are we?
---
People just want to see crow as strong as Leon since he‚Äôs been the worse legendary brawler for a very long while now. And I‚Äôd have to agree this would be the only reason I‚Äôd like crow to get a Buff but that‚Äôs it. 
---
If anything spike, Pam, Nita, Shelly should get nerfs which in turn would make it easier to use other brawlers like crow. 
---
More like you bought legendary lmao.
---
This belongs in a modern art museum
---
Oof didn‚Äôt know lol 
---
I would just stay on the boat and wait for everyone else to die
---
lucky to play against people with such shit aim, id never survive that. Good play
---
I can't explain it too.
---
He is still trying to prove it to me üòÇ
---
Or mortis, but Shelly has a shotgun!
---
You forgot the red lines.
---
Bro can I get your autograph before you blow up
---
I team to backstab but I don‚Äôt team to kill other brawlers. Unless I‚Äôm with a tank then I team to kill other brawlers that team lol. Feel bad for them they always get teamed on :/
---
you stay i go no following
---
I didn‚Äôt know bro
---
Oops
---
I will always remember when a Bull was hiding in a bushes and shot me from his mid range and then spared my life for some reason. I would have lost 6 trophies and I was so grateful.
---
The third one is super cute!!!!
---
Don't worry we were all at that point one time
---
Highly doubt they backstab for that reason, probably do it for the extra power cube and think I‚Äôm a noob that doesn‚Äôt know they can backstab lol. 
---
Less bushes and I‚Äôm all in but overall a new concept of the map 
---
Nice analysis 
---
Might be true
---
I‚Äôm so sorry man I like the idea but just because you said petition I gotta downvote this! So sorry!!
---
r/itwassarcasmyoudisfunctionalmemberofterrestrialsociety 
---
Well it‚Äôs just my opinion, but tbh if they were a true teamer, they would probably not have killed you, unless they are a person who really despises teaming.
---
You mean heist?
---
F
---
I don‚Äôt get this. But I would like to. Will you pls try to explain?

What are the odds...

Is this even a question? Lmfao.
---
Sad but very very true... 
---
\*tear in my eye\*
---
Use walls, play smart.  
---
Not saying that you are playing dumb, but as leon is right now, tanks like Primo is actually a counter to leon.
---
If you are complaining about this now, you should try and remember how leon shred through tanks in previous versions before his deserved nerf.
---
Wow my OCD level is also bothering me... Supercell please fix this for the sake of the 1.4k people who upvoted this
---
Nice dude
---
Is anyone going to point out the obvious in the fact that it‚Äôs a repost just with one word changed? Dang

While clash-a-rama does pretty well in putting morals, themes, and character development into their episodes, most of the characters who learned from their actions were only seen once and once only (in their respective episodes). Brawl-a-rama, with its individual characters, can supersede that because the writers can expand on each characters' arcs. That being said, I think the ability to expand character development is what makes "brawl-a-rama" better than clash-a-rama.
---
Haha nice one dessmo
---
Did anyone notice buff crowin the bottom?
---
lol if it makes you feel better my legendary chance went from 0.14 to 0.03
---
Except for mine. 50% of them go to negative upvotes
---
i cant find leon 
---
*Weird flex but ok*
---
i would trade my Leon for any Mythics i dont have any oof
---
Chance to get a legendary does not decrease if you buy a brawler that affects the chance (mythics and legendaries)

Except the one shot that missed

Wow

---
instead of buff characters why do not the characters that really need to have a nerf improve to put them at the height of the rest ?, if something is right is better not to touch it .. and if something does not work as expected perhaps needs improvement. I will never understand the way you guys think about " balance."
---
I still slip up and call them keys from time to time... you‚Äôre not alone.
---
and whole community says crow needs buff.....

&amp;#x200B;

How did u get footage of my recent heist match??

(But srsly tho, u are a colt god in this clip, nice)
---
Honest truth though. It‚Äôs a 1/100 chance of drawing a star power.  If you always have one player at lvl 9 (we‚Äôre not spending money, so it takes time to lvl up brawlers) there‚Äôs no need to spend your hard earned coins on a star power.. just keep playing and get them from a box.
---
holy shit shit shit
---
Now try rico

LmaoüòÇI get what u mean

Yes, sitting at 46k coins right now woohoo, I know that‚Äôs nothing compared to some people out there..

Has that always been there?

I don't see anything wrong here

you make me miss ricochet more , just do more like this please

I got Pam and Spike before I got Penny and Rico not joking

Yeah, shotgunners and tanks are the easiest brawlers to push. I have two accounts, and on both Bull is my highest trophies brawler

The skin has an discount because of japan blossom festival

Yeah sure..

Well, I have the same curse too. I lost 150 trophies each with Shelly and Brock. It happens.

I'm mostly playing with him on gem grab. You have to be patient. Charge up your super and wait enemy gem carrier become low hp target or your temmates who has a brawler that take him out quickly. I agree he needs a better reload speed. 
---
 Mine is lvl.4 with 264 cups. Maybe someone can give us a better advice tho.
---
Lemme get this straight. No one is playing alone? Y'all just play with friends??
---
I also have it
---
Nice man 
---
Brawl Stars is the BEST!!!
---
:)
---
It should be getting 6 mins 
---
5 is too easy 
---
WHY IS THERE NO BRAWL TALK
---
* laughs in clash of clans *
---
So you basically provide almost no real help to the other two teammates who are clearly struggling to fight? Gene's reload speed proves this. Gene' super is slow, and the gem carrier may just dodge an attack.
---
Oof 
---
Stop with these ffs

it could just be a dude called leon who didn't know there is a brawler called leon when he made the account.

what?

Agreed!!

BUFF CROW to you too. We should make this a call/salute.

Meh

probably a repost since old images

My friend has spike in his ign is leon because his real name is leon. IS THIS MY FRIEND

Jessie is 16....

The powerpoints you would normally have gotten will get converted into coins, 1 power point = 2 coins
---
most likely. but its just a little satire
---
This isn‚Äôt confirmed by the team btw
---
Doubt it since I got 4:15 just now with her
---
there are most likely countless players called leon. theres one in my club who doesnt have spike
---
pice of Brawl Stars
---
Yes!! Are we friends in-game?üòÅ

Good Idea but dont make the flash affect teammates. The flash should last longer as his star power. Also why is he bo's brother

The hole system is crap, loosing trophy after loosing match is like gambling, wich is illegal by the fact that the most players are underage! Matchmaking is also the worst i ever saw in a game. Lets see what the googlplay tos says about the underage gambling fact :)

ok

Thx bro
---
what the fuck?
---
After I loose 3 games I take a break if not this will happen. 
---
6. sounds good
---
On open area maps he can damage other brawlers because his range is really good. Even tho his spreaded shot is not strong, It's giving damage and also stop them to heal. He is just a last minute brawler like Tara. They can collect all the gems and you can just take everything in a split second. Enemy will play more defensive if you are playing with one of those two. Tara is way more stronger than him that's for sure.
---
Chingelor my gloria
---
Today I got Carl by the way XD
---
I mean, gene is literally tara but weaker by a lot
---
What if you lose another 3 games after that? And then another?

I've already posted Shelly's origin story I'll post a few more of the brawler origin stories today then once I've posted them all I'll start sketching them as comics.
---
It would be awesome to make an entire new character out of this concept, rather than just a skin.

Thats pretty cool though, love this community more and more as time passes.

You have a max rank 15 Shelley when my Shelley is only power 7 and rank 18 üòï

It‚Äôs rewind time

SO ACCURATE, i died a lot because of some smart players who got the energy just in time XD
---
*just follow my moves and sneak around
---
The hood eyes are creepy. And the lolipop looks like a white tongue. You can improve it but still nice idea.
---
Please state specifically what point are you trying to make

Shelly=no skill=OP

How is this even a bug
---
Did not know

Wow nice

Said the maxed out player.

That happened to me, too

Join our gang by using the flair r/crowgang

Ur bad at the game my lowest brawler is only 20 trophies below ur highest

I‚Äôm not sure but from what people have said ya it‚Äôs been there

Pretty dank

&gt;I have killed many many manyyyyy idiots like you who think they can take the cube and still kill me or who are greedy for cube and just run for it
---
Good because like that you git one every 5 weeks which is a out a month
---
lol wut
---
Sorts by brawler trophy and total trophy. As for power levels...Support the devs. I've been max since 2k trophies, it really wasn't that expensive.
---
Oh..nice. but I was talking about ppl who didn't give up. 
---
I like the name and how the map resembles the face
---
This comment has been made by r/crowgang
---
Exactly
---
But crow is pretty good
---
Yeah for sure!

why is the native american‚Äôs brother a soldier?

I watched his ‚Äúentire history of brawl stars video so I get it

Thanks!
---
Mortis is viable in conpetitive siege, not the best option but no doubt he's viable.

---
You make a compelling argument, but it did nothing to change my original point.
---
The tanks are weak, and though they may be able to reach safes and win games that way doesn‚Äôt change the fact that they can‚Äôt deal with other brawlers unless they get lucky and the opponent misplays. Even if you can use walls and bushes to help you the long ranged brawlers like Colt and Brock can just destroy them with stunning efficiency. The developers changed green bushes so they no longer grow back, what I think they should do is bring this back, but for walls instead, or they could bring back the invulnerable walls and put some in every level to create areas that will always be tank friendly. 
---
I was there since Electro Valley was introduced. Too bad my screen is too narrow to see that.
---
Define Ike?
---
Wait till you get crows star power, hes really fun as big brawler! XD him and spike are probably my favorites. Jessie is boring to play as BB.
---
I‚Äôm on a iPad and I think you can only see it on the end screen
---
I like the nw Morris attack anim tho
---
Lol don't beat yourself up you'll get her maxed in no time
---
You dont have to have crow to say buff crow
---
Your English is horrible 
---
If you have the gems, you should buy it. If not, it depends on whether you play the game enough to spend ~50 USD on a pack of gems.

Ive got the gems from the package deals, but I dont have any legendaries and I miss 2 red tier rariry brawlers as well

Why

Yes damage us way to high

It sux

Aku aku with a body and necromancy powers.

El Primo but different Star Power.
---
Mega star power too op 
---
No. Buff Crow.
---
It is mortis' hat
---
* laughs in hay day *
---
Mortis is a high skill cap brawler. And now hes actually good in the meta. He does NOT need a reload speed buff or he'd be as good as the old leon. And we dont want that now do we....
---
Before the balance change, mortis was baggage to people who cant use him well now hes buffed and way stronger. What more do you want
---
2.5 second is very slow.2 sec is good
---
How t9 make your name without any words?

OH YES! I would love this in the game!

Thx
---
Only 5 minutes? Why not like 6? That would be better
---
Sakura spike
---
I actually like white crow though ;-;
---
Probably,
---
Its not because you were mortis! Its becuz you were in wrong spot at wrong time. I have seen video where many people team against a primo. What will you say? That they must have mistaken him for primo? I am just sayin there is no definetive mind set to team against  a mortis as he is not really that dangerous as shelly is with her super.
---
Unpopular opinion: the devs literally said night witch mortis was not supposed to look good, but be a joke. The effects are cool and I think it‚Äôs funny so I use it. And white crow is a good skin cause it‚Äôs a cleaner reskin that looks dope overall it‚Äôs just more refined
---
"commit not alive"
---
Who uses piper in big game lmao
---
Bruh
---
No you couldn‚Äôt. At that many trophies you can‚Äôt even pull tickets
---
Arr you liljopka?

I hope he sees himself being buffed!
---
Hell yeahüòÜüòÜüòÜ
---
I got itüòè
---
I see. Thx for your reminder. Maybe I have to review Bull. Anyway thx! Anther chance to improve myself for better understanding of a brawler. I appreciate it!
---
Ok thanks for the reply
---
Bro proxy was that post on r/pewdiepiesubmitions woth 45.5k upvotes yours?!
---
I got 7 minutes on my 2k trophy mini
---
This post was very hastily made sorry
---
Is it wrong if I enjoy both games ?
---
You actually could. You could claim them every time a new events pops up. 
---
10 tokens to claim for a new event, 2 tickets for a weekend event
---
Nah it's definitely because i was mortis cause every showdown i played yesterday i was getting teamed against since there were pretty less bulls and primos around
---
300IQ
---
I like that 
---
Considering that every other brawler is defeated in roughly 1 minute.
---
When 4 coins turned into a gem
---
We won like 7 times in a row

I still don‚Äôt believe that anyone under 10 trophies would play robo rumble with any success

Convinces me to use carl :/

Also, the animation bugs, and carl does not have the blue blur around him 
---
#Make one eye blue

Images you can hear

I wonder what is he playing in the VR
---
How TF are you level 15 with a power 9+ Rico?
---
Nice I love getting good randoms
---
Oh, ok then I saw simmilar idea on reddit. 
---
Poco is not Sans, he has not his same personality 
---
She looks like mini cell from DBZ lol
---
It‚Äôs not recommended but it‚Äôs possible with good players 
---
we got the same name in game lol
---
Is this a Bug, Glitch, or a strategy?
---
Will we get a new meta at least havent seen a new meta since golbal maybe a assassin meta kinda but it was just put on top of tje cureent meta
---
Someone hit 19s
---
Did you first attack the colt ?because it might be the oh you won‚Äôt get away boi but it can be teaming or he‚Äôs just blind
---
üò£

I was just trying to prove someone wrong. Just forget this post even existed

Hmm I‚Äôll try Ma best

Credit to u/thecoldbeholder for making this template

This tread includes

1.its coming apirl fools

2. We need an update

3.stop rushing the devs
---
4.this update better be bigger than normal
---
5.the meta is stale
---
6. Crow and carl buff memes
---
Thank u i used it 
---
No the piper did not attack at all and let the colt kill the crow. Then they spin when the crow was killed
---
Jessie is not that good on exactly this map but yeah sometimes 2x/3x of the same brawlernin a team is so unfair
---
Jokes on you I check bushes
---
Assume for now that some brawler stole his lollipop so he is throwing his shuriken at the brawler to seek revenge
---
No if it you was first to attack the colt
---
Noooooooooooooo....
---
Same royale is just more p2w but I love everything else about it
---
Removed - Your post is too short, please expand on your title.
---
The piper did not attack the colt at all
---
*Deal with it*
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇ frank was like sike u thought
---
Loved this Idea 
---
Only '90s Kids Will Remember
---
Here you go :)
---
Folding Fan: Katashi creates a gust of wind, hitting enemies. The gust will pass through walls while dealing less damage.
---
Razor Sweep: Katashi delivers a breeze of air slashing enemies and bushes. You can run but you certainly cannot hide!
---
Shockwave: Enemies hoy by Katashi‚Äôs Super will be disarmed and unable to attack for 2 seconds.
---
Btw guys, I'm not that piper. I took a picture of a post from a teamer
---
Bull would be proud of your bush hiding ability
---
I have the same legendary rating
---
i know that but why was this posted after gene was released
---
Yeah but Frank is balanced around having the only stun in the game. He cannot move while atacking, his atack animation is slow and his super is even slower and he has a small range. Landing a Frank super its 80% outsmarting your enemies. That star power its broken beyond relief.
---
So yes?
---
Thats what Im sayingüëç
---
Loved this crow skin.ü§©ü§ó
---
Thank you very much 
---
I am more lucky
---
3 legendaries from small boxes lol
---
That's like saying you can't push any brawler cause they're 'trash', what about a power 1 brawler, is that 'trash' 
---
That‚Äôs cool
---
I have all the brawlers in the game expect the 3 legendaries bro , I‚Äôm at 6200 trophies and didn‚Äôt get any legendaries , but i think this rating is high
---
wait colt why were you in the basement
---
Shotgunners dream
---
I wonder why we still havent got a japaneseish melee brawler. Something like a Yasuo wouldnt be out of place.
---
That just wouldn't work bruh, what if a power cube 9 Shelly go against a no power cube piper. 
---
Colt is living with Jess??
---
yeah this dudes just tryna act like he's 13k even tho he just took a pic of someone else's account lmfao
---
i would not just barge into their mouth uk. try to learn playing rather than blaming each and everything on supercell
---
#IT'S JUST A GAME
---
Happened exactly the same with my Franck down from 382 to 290...it‚Äôs when you think you‚Äôre back that you loose more. 
---
My Tara was at 344 and went down to 260.... 
---
few minutes ago I was back at 299 and then 3 solo showdown later back down to 280....üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Then you try Siege, Gem grab, Bounty and you end with ramdoms playing like eejits and you loose more....
---
Only I found to get those trophies back is solo showdown and hide while the others kill themselves....
---
Me too i only have 3800 ;-;
---
Yeah I agree people die of coffins
---
I can not hear it, I can not see it :P 
---
You are copying me!!!
---
J'y fais pas attention dans tous les cas ^^

#WHAT‚ÄôS NEW:
---
#50 NEW BOUNTY MAPS
---
#99 SKINS
---
Don't get fooled into people saying he's the worst. He's certainly not. If u play him like a bull or primo obv he's not gonna be good.
---
 Just keep opponnents tagged w ur attack and keep them pushed back no need to use super to try and finish them off unless it does something for the objective (like if they have gems, or r only one alive blocking the score in bb). Mind ur health and keep ur distance. If facing something was longer range, crow is faster and smaller hitbox so easy to dodge w him if u practice.
---
Anyway good luck
---
Yup it‚Äôs annoying af
---
You mispelled reinhardt lol
---
Hes probably in VR playing a buffed version of himself üòÇ
---
Honestly with the state of matchmaking in brawl being so damn frustrating rn, I'd almost rather play CR. But hey, at least I've got COC to tide me over until something is changed!
---
Nice aiming skills man! Also, every time there‚Äôs a Piper vid posted a lot of people immediately cry auto-aim. If it were that easy to auto-aim with Piper then you‚Äôd see a lot of Pipers being played, as much as Bulls and Shellys. Unless your opponents are standing perfectly sill, auto-aim just doesn‚Äôt work with long range brawlers, especially Piper and Brock. 
---
2 shelly can instalock you with just two supers, but 2 Frank don't even stun the boss even for a solid second
---
I actually would LOVE to see miner type of brawler in the game.
---
Can you clarify exactly what you want answered
---
Can you dm me a ss, shouldn‚Äôt be too hard
---
No worries man, we all had our terrible times haha, u will get good at it in no time.
---
How can I do this editing?

I have good new brawlers ideas

I suggest joining either a Tribe or Nova club. They are active and have really great people!
---
And 1 year for Andoid launch
---
Great concept. I would love to see more brawlers based on earth elements. 
---
Good but I guess normal attacks shouldn't go over wall, it will be bad but super attack can go over wall.
---
Any starpower idea you have for this brawler ?
---
Yeah I totally support that.
---
Big facts
---
Got any specific ones? When i search for clubs it gives me fake ones with like 2000 cups. 
---
I don't hate White Crow. But it's WAY too expensive for a damn palette swap
---
You are a beast!üò±
---
Uhm 2 secs lemme search
---
The bots don't really go away until about 420-440 in my experience :(
---
Star power is created on the concept you didn‚Äôt notice. He is a legendary brawler, he will be the only one with attack through walls, it is his main feature 
---
You can join Tribe Mystic (totally not just saying that cause I‚Äôm in there üåö)
---
Ha! Brawl stars nerd 
---
Don't complain, bro
---
It'll ne worse
---
I have 6000 trophies and only have 18 brawlers
---
sry about that, I'm using a school-borrowed laptop.
---
I know crow is so underwhelming in 3v3 modes but in SD &amp; DS crow is a top3 with pam and leon. Imagine how strong crow will be on showdown maps if he gets a significant buff.
---
Me too
---
Ready player one
---
Awesome. We should have a diverse set of brawlers to choose from.
---
Yes but shadow its new brawler who look like raven
---
Agreed man, my Piper is at 552 as i am typing this, couldn't have gotten her to 500 with auto-aim and my Brock was top 200 couple of seasons ago (u can see in my previous posts),also if it were auto-aim i would have clapped the auto-aim button but u can see i took lil time between each shot, thx for the support ma dude, really appreciate it!
---
Why is rbjs global player talking to a beta player like he is any good? Before spending any more money on fortnite you should tell your parents about your spending issues :&gt;
---
If only the people with half a brain weren't all only playing with teams, then my solo ass wouldnt be stuck spending 80% of my time playing recouping losses from braindead randos.
---
Save
---
You need 5555 coins, 555 trophies, 5 of each box, and 55 tokens left to be earned
---
BS means Brawl Stars right? not the other thing? lol
---
lol imagine you in a public bathroom and you here "wham bam here comes pam!"
---
In solo showdown, for example? Grouping up? That is mildly effective, as his super just disorients the group.
---
Buff crow...Lol
---
Its kinda annoying but good
---
Its removed
---
I see you‚Äôre a man of culture as well. I‚Äôve never teamed and never will team. I also backstabbed for the first time yesterday. #stopthespin
---
Serves him right
---
Crow doesn't need a buff, others brawlers needs nerfs
---
he‚Äôs strong against some characters and weak against others like every other brawler, thats my point
---
Watch my 1 hand video with eclihpse... I zoom in on important moments, use short audio clips for something short and longer audio clips for things spanning over 2/3 seconds. I move the screen accordingly if the screen is off, I speed up/slow down the footage when necessary (slow down for suspense, speed up for long, boring clips until the suspense.)
---
look at my newest post lmao 
---
What? 
---
True but showdown is my favourite game mode. I never really cared for gem grabs and heists, especially now that my friends dont play much anymore. So for me its showdown or lose all my trophies. Lol I'm just being salty.
---
The post is removed
---
I like the idea of this... Good work!
---
No it is not
---
IDK is this!?
---
No this is my idea
---
I do that too when I get to be the big brawler 
---
I know I won‚Äôt buy the plush cuz i‚Äôm broke but in the game I almost have enough to buy him and use him more. I don‚Äôt use spike a lot I use crow more but maybe this cutie will make me use him more 
---
Thank you

Put them with a random against a duo with a random. Don't see how it's that hard tbh

Ikr, very creative!
---
Leon
---
Witch craft
---
r/CrowGang
---
I understand, but please prove your point then.
---
I can prove otherwise with a few examples:
---
Bull vs Leon: Leon wins because big damage up close + some of the bull's bullets will miss leon.
---
Shelly vs leon: Leon wins by range
---
Pam vs Leon: Leon wins by dps at point blank range. He will kill pam faster with his blades than she kills him with her scrap minigun.
---
I could prove more of my points, but i need some time. What brawlers (in your opinion) is leon no match for?
---
barley lol
---
Oh, I didn‚Äôt see.

I have map with same name

I‚Äôd tap..... wait what

why a blank picture?

Wow looks so good probably your best one yet !

Lucky you.

(This offer is usually now worth it because you can get the same value with only 100 gems buying token doublers from shop).

Still, the furthest he can travel is 5 tiles. I tested this in a Friendly Game.

That's not skill that Darryl was clearly trolling
---
I want spike 
---
&gt;Cause I think everyone knows how the map is gonna go like 
---
You said it only a few minutes ago. Now you said "many people". Please make up your mind.
---
I didnt say it was "a joke", i said "joking reputation". This means that people often exaggerate on here when they tell their opinion. A lot of people might dislike it, but I doubt that a lot of people actually hate it.
---
Either way, you now trying to insult me personally shows me that youre not the kind of person that can be discussed with. IDK your age, but you seem quite childish in the way youre responding. I didnt expect you to feel personally attacked, I was trying to express my feelings about your post in an objective way, but apparently you cant take any friendly meant critisism. 
---
Dont take everything so personally. How about you accept that other people might have different opinions from yours, even if they seem "boring" to you? How about, instead of trying to defend what others critizised, you just say "okay, its cool that you have a different opinion but I cant identify with it at all". 
---
Anyway, this has taken up too much of my time anyway. I'll continue being boring now.
---
Maybe because they are "GREEDY" and not use "STRATEGIC" gameplay. But also beware in Brawl Ball if you play with randoms. Literally just lost because someone purposely kicked the ball to OUR goal. Literally the community is the problem to this game in my opinion. With all the teaming, and the other stuff. You get my point. 
---
Happened to me today in gem grab. Thought 'haha sucka!' then I died lol. Luckily I was carrying no gems
---
It‚Äôs not that hard to See if a rewarding system is bad or not and it is the worst I have ever seen xD 
---
 Beside that the most console titles for 60‚Ç¨ are not worth their price, free2play doesn‚Äôt justify this mess. 
---
Yea it‚Äôs gonna bad
---
And you also assumed I was getting attacked
---
He tagged it as a bug genius
---
But if ur playing with randoms. They literally don't know what ur doing. 
---
The bear ahould be yellow, or maybe it‚Äôs a dark brown cat with ears pointing up, top tier skin still
---
i know...
---
Then why did you say that lol
---
same
---
True
---
i would bust outta that place asap
---
because the person im responding to said its photoshop
---
And geez who knew somebody can turn this conversation into a paragraph cause I don‚Äôt feel like reading your whole rant and stuff
---
Same happened to be but I had a token doubler. I did not get a new brawler from my boxes.
---
Contact Supercell. You can do it through the game
---
Wanna see you dealing with all those Pams alone.
---
Same here, I loved it when I was a kid. I think the 1st season is the best.
---
Good point
---
What glitch?
---
Nice work dude/gal. Reminds me of Tron
---
Well yes, but actually no. He kind of does, maybe not something like this but his in-game model could use updating. Just for example, go and take a look at his hands compared to other brawlers :p
---
Sans
---
No, just no. Idk but you should probably get it before 6 months because its gonna get deleted. 
---
Never believe this

Just got mine today

Couldn‚Äôt believe it

Yeah sure, do you even know how many boxes I opened? You couldn't open the amount of boxes I opened even if you could open boxes 24h/24 non stop for a month, I have 0,1776% and still nothing. 
---
i l9ve it
---
wow nice
---
But that thing...
---
That scares me
---
Like you could put one in the top right corner and one in the bottom left corner where the wall thins out to 1 tile wide, that way the brawler that spawns there could get to the box right there easier and make a nice little passage
---
Is that true?
---
Cooool!
---
