Not to be rude or anything, but I don't think you did this by yourself. If you look closely you could see a change in the color very slightly between the pixels that are touching. You can convert a normal image to a pixel image at [pinetools.com](https://pinetools.com/pixelate-effect-image) and it will look like that.

I think this is great. It encourages people to actually aim instead of just spamming auto-aim. Ive been  able to get kills even when I‚Äôm severely weaker just because the enemy only spams auto-aim.

No, this isn't even funny

I have 7 50 rosa in seige and brawl ball made at least half

Only real nerf Rosa needs is movement speed. It should be like 680, slowest in game. Leave everything else OP and Rosa would be great with a slow movement speed.

I honestly do not understand why 3 people are debating this as a feature. It already exist. Literally, choose to auto aim...or choose not to. Also, I am pretty sure the guy meant to make a feature where you can turn on/off your Brawler shooting at a box instead of an enemy. That also would still be unfair as melee champions would have no cover against ranged champions when fighting for a box.
---
I doubt they would get a seprate series. Mabye appear in the existing one (like how hay day and boom beach did) a few times
---
I'm not complaining lol.  It legitimately helped me get lvl 5 Morty
---
Sure, act like you dont know what im talking about... also, if you only look through the last 10 comments i made there isnt gonna be anythingg good.
---
Aside from explaining the lore behind the brawlers, it's also pretty cool because it kinda explains the story behind gem grab, showdown, and bounty.

Haha either your new to tara or your just a dumb dumb :) you don‚Äôt know the tears I shed when she was nerfed into the ground now she is more of a high skill brawler instead of mid skill

I know you don‚Äôt want to hear this but the game isn‚Äôt the issue, but your routine. Every team based stat-heavy game has this same sort of cycle. For me, once I lose 3-4 in a row or about 7 in total I take a break for the day. Knowing when to stop and be desperate to recover trophies is the key to staying sane. Trust me, I‚Äôve played World of Tanks for 7 years and the tilt from that game is pure, unadulterated rage.

The turret can charge in like 2 seconds if you get a lucky triple bounce as Jessie, it would be WAY too overpowered if it could kill in seconds. Every super is supposed to be a GAME changer that has to be respected and played around, not a ‚Äúthere‚Äôs nothing you can do about me‚Äù like rosas is. I‚Äôve played plenty of TF2, and the reason the turret is so good is cause it takes so much time to build up. Jessie‚Äôs is an extremely annoying nuisance that must be respected. You have to kill it, because if you dont, you WILL take a noticeable amount of damage, but at the end of the day, the real nuisance is Jessie herself
---

---
Ah Hoy
---
G E K O L O N I S E E R D
---
Yeah I have been thinking about that too and I was thinking about buffing the star power so you are able to upgrade the turret by attacking it
---
The trophies themselves make you think they are important. Competitive games are mostly unforgiven. You can quit man, sorry... The game itself is fun, FUN, that is why it mostly exists. And yeah, there is no other purpose in this game than to get trophies, but it is freaking fun, sooo much fun mannn. That is why it is important to take breaks. I quit for the same reason, but I took a 2 week break, and in that time I played Minecraft on my Survival world. Minecraft is relaxing, but Brawl Stars was too fun to just... forget about it.

And as his opponent would be at 300 trophies and not a at 0 trophies, he would certainly be skilled enough! and wouldn't be all 10! Tell me a bwtter solution!
---
Yeah it is annoying, atleast we made them pay the price haha
---
i think i know my brawler better than them. lucky me
---
That Rosa should've killed Shelly first.. who is more dangerous at 0 power than Nita with 11 Power because of her super lol
---
Are you seriously such a dummy...
---
EACH BOTTLE DOES DAMAGE FOUR TIMES
---
YOU ONLY HIT ONE OF THEM
---
She said it because she is OP
---
I would increase the amount of hits needed to charge her super from 9 hits (3 attack bars) to at least 15 hits (5 attack bars) because right now she can just stack her super over and over again. Same with shelly, a lot of brawlers have the problem of being able to stack their supers on top of each other. These brawlers include Frank, Shelly, Rico, Jessie, Penny etc. These brawlers can charge their super really quickly. I think there should be at least a 5-10 second cooldown after using a super ability, so people cant just spam it indefinitely but rather have to tactically decide when to use their super to get the most out of it.
---
 Mortis is one of the weakest brawlers right now. Sure he is pretty good for objectives like brawlball or gem grab, but he is a melee brawler and cant even kill many sharpshooters with 3 strikes, so you have to follow them around leaving yourself exposed until your next attack has charged.
---
He is supposed to be an assassin, but he feels like a very weak el primo. A damage buff would be good meanwhile slightly nerfing the super range and width to make it fair.
---
buffing his reload speed is just going to make him overpowered in brawl ball again, so i would rather increase his damage.
---
the dyna wtf

So everybody stole it? That makes him the 7.6 billionth bad guy, give him a prize

Do you even read what i said? You can't get player with power level more then you at 3 lvls. You just can't get that in mm.

3 lvls is just 10-15%, its not serious
---
Lil strong?

Well I mean, 70 gems is worth 550 gold according to the shop, so I guess they're roughly the same value? The one on the right more so, and of course gems are way more valuable than gold when you're not speaking strictly numbers

Rosa doesn't get a speed boost while supering. And if you can't check bushes then stay away from them. Pick your brawlers after carefully analyzing the map.

I said IMO its unfair...because how can 0 powercube shelly stack so many supers and win against 10 powercube bull while she has no powercubes...And dont even get me started with when enemies are grouped up..Thats why I think its unfair, she should be winning against that IMO

They dont lower ranks because you get rewards when ever you rank up and you cant get rewards twice. But i agree that you should drop and if you climb back up you just dont get the reward again
---
Yes
---
sock spike sock spike
---
Also, team comp remarks are accurate... if u are running w buddies. Comp losses are honest losses. Bit what about randoms? The comp u are dealt is what you strategize with. So, now u have two factors u have no control of deciding the outcome on the highest trophy wager in the game. Control team is again, at a disadvantage from the start in favor of the suicide squad that has big dps for last round auto win. I get what u are saying. Comeback is a strategy. Bit in seige it's more of a consolation win for losing the first 75% of the game

My lao. My father taught me how to speak. Properly.

This also pisses me off about Gem Grab and Siege.  It's pretty fucking obvious if I'm the carrier, or if a bolt is spawning on my side I can handle it.  Stop trying to carry and know your role.
---
Reality
---
lmao
---
Brawl stars games are 10 times faster than tf2 matches. There would either be no point in taking the time to set up the turret, or it would be too fast and way too good
---
Battle pass would actually be a great thing for this game.
---
no
---
Love the template. But idk what meme I should do...
---
No
---
NO
---
NOO
---
lol jump in and kill everyone.
---
Good idea
---
You start behind because maybe your comp isn't good at controlling the mid, so you will lose the collect the most bolts each round. Then it feels like the last round didn't help you at all. This would feel so terrible and literally after the first lost round people would give up. Siege is already a mode full of people just giving up before the match is over, no need to make them do it 30 seconds in.     
---
Just think about if they made this change and you collected 6 and they collect 7. Then next round you collect 9 and they collect 10. You would be pissed and posting literally the opposite thing on reddit. This wouldn't fix the mode, it would just change the meta to be more restrictive on what brawlers you can use in siege.    
---
Any way you try to spin it, the team that loses will inherently feel bad. That's kind of how multiplayer games work. This post just looks like you got out played and are qqing. Instead of calling for an overhaul of the mode, look at what you could have done to win. Maybe you had someone constantly dying each time you pushed, if they hadn't you would have won. Maybe you should have let them take one of the middle rounds to set yourself up better at the end.
---
Totally, they will be trusted and when they add new features it will be too late, the same has happened to them with CoC and CR, they have gotten the best when people just play those games.
---
Great meme bro. Make more

I've been playing for a few months, am up to 4200, and am frustrated.
---
* Rosa is unplayable for me.
---
* Mortis should be banned, because any match I'm in w/ him 90% of the time I know the side that has him will win. (I believe brawlers should be designed in a way that each one can beat any other one one-on-one.)
---
* There's little effort by Supercell to actually help new players understand how to play the game. I've asked for months for something on how to use the controls on my phone and have gotten silence.  I still really don't know how to aim or how to get better at it. (The players making YouTube videos skip over that in their "basics" videos too.) So I've stumbled around playing in frustration for months.
---
Instead, Supercell focuses on new brawlers and marketing campaigns like playing with the Stranger Things cast. Ho-hum! Don't care!

In showdown yes, but in every other game mode it‚Äôs bottom tier. She needs to get close to use it and that just doesn‚Äôt happen often enough for it to be good

Dynamike can't kill mortis so pls

That's the sense of her super, man... If not, she'll be useless!

Never once have I seen teaming Tara's.

That looks soo creepy no jk

Idk why people think that shelly should just be about super... She should be well-rounded as tour first brawler, not just ,,click to charge super, click super to kill"

r/itswooooshwith4os
---
I see your point, but the rewards are just so extremely tiny... for example theres a lot of default brawl boxes... A box you could get by waiting a few hours and winning 3 showdown matches. I'm saying that it doesn't feel like a reward at all. It's something you could easily obtain anyway. But I do understand your point and yes, the rewards shouldn't be too big but especially against the end... a bit higher rewards would be cooler. Even before 10k. 
---
Also, about coins: I think theyre horribly balanced. When youre working towards upgrading they are so rare and a pain to get (50 or even less in a normal Brawl Box) and in the end they pile up wayyyyyyyy too much.

Why would you level brawlers if you get matched with people with the same brawler level? Doesn't make sense to me tbh. It doesn't matter if you're level 1 or 10 if all people in the game are the same level I would just not level brawlers.
---
I actually made it so shut up

It's not funny when it's repetitive like this. Everyone keeps shitting on siege like it's that different from other modes, the only difference is that your mistakes are amplified, so people who make mistakes have lower winrates. I also play with randoms and get a very good result. Got 3 brawlers to 500 since siege lauched, and I mostly just play for the daily tokens.

I'm just tired of every other day people talking shit about siege. It's not funny, get over it.

I think he is just going to do nice things with it because he's barley
---

That‚Äôs why I mostly just draw and post brawler concepts now, stale meta needs to be fixed üò™

I like to call it mutualism, thank you.

Hi Rosa!

It's not teaming because there was no spinning.  There was no agreement.  It is no different than someone waiting in the bushes for one of two who are fighting to ambush them.  It's a moment of opportunity especially if the third person is last to the fight.  The purpose of solo showdown is to be the last one standing.  If your health is low someone is going to see the opportunity and take you out getting them one step closer to the win.  Doesn't matter if you are already fighting someone else or not.  That's not teaming.  That's opportunity.  I can't seriously believe that you don't take advantage of these kinds of opportunities.  I can't imagine seeing a fight in SD where a brawler is low on health running away from an attacker and someone saying "I'm not going to kill this brawler.  It would be to easy." You would probably kill them and the one they were running from because they were low on health too.  By your definition that is teaming.  It is not.  It is just playing the game.
---
I don't really have issues with teaming as I usually play Duo Showdown.  I think Solo Showdown would be better without mass teaming but it won't change till the community is against it.  You will know that the community is against it when it stops happening
---
This happens to me all the time gets more and more satisfying each time tho
---
thats a big army
---
what do you need the sound for?
---
*Jessie has entered the chat*

I don‚Äôt even know either... it would kind of make sense if he was trying to drop trophies for some reason, but it would be faster to just run into the gas in solo showdown every match, not to mention you wouldn‚Äôt be griefing anyone. But that‚Äôs not the case here. He only did this with El Primo and he did it in siege. No idea why.
---
Not the earliest I've seen... my cousin got Crow at about 230 trophies.
---
I play colt
---
Do people not know there memes?

I personally don't like the meme but it was just made to make people smile and other people can enjoy this meme. Not your problem that I have darker sense of humor :)
---
