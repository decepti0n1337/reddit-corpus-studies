hey man, I wanted to ask if I could use this clip for my youtube channel. I will link your twitter/reddit/youtube whatever you want if you give me permission to use this clip in my video. Thank you for reading and stay awesome!

I didn’t even know you were rico, I stopped playing the game so the new skins confuse me.
---
Always happens to me 
---
I would totally buy
---
I am horrible with Rico, so I wasn’t mad
---
100 would definitely buy
---
Teaming would be a bitch in this
---
Mortis can be really good on gem grab on some maps. He is good at hiding in bushes and dashing in for the gems if your team mates can hold the gem spawn.
---
Ok
---
I think it’s lag and I’m pretty sure they are constantly working on reducing that! Your movement needs to be verified and synced by the server and if the connection is really slow, it will appear as if you’re barely moving.

Asymmetrical 3v3 maps will lead to people complaining about bad spawns or favor one side over the other.

Agreed 🌚

Hey dude u know in practice mode everyone is upgraded and there are no meteors. LMAO!

I get people with power lvl 10 and trophies around 480 and I'm like stuck on 400 and power lvl is 7

That's the thing - using Mortis as a gem carrier is really bad. He should be played as an aggro. By holding the gems, Mortis gets handicapped.

I guess I argue more so the balance between characters rather than the servers

Showdown is the least skill involved mode and many tops agree with that. It’s all luck based in essence, as boxes spawn in randoms spots and your spawn is random. It’s a random, and generally easy, gamemode:

Because either they took so long to get to that amount of trophies by alternating wins and losses that they've maxed their account or simply because they spents money to max it. I have 7300 trophies, almost maxed out in power points... 11 star powers and almost no gold to upgrade my brawlers

Yes

Crow got buffed 0.1 attack speed

Even when I'm well inside of his range, if the missile comes close to me without touching me I take the damage as if I got hit instead of it just flying out to the end of his range then exploding.

And it’s so weird when there’s a season reset you lose 50% trophies every 2 weeks above 500 trophies that it’s like sueprcells are soooo jealous about how high we can push our trophies so they decided to stop us by adding that 50% trophy lose every 2 week

Now you can rock siege with her turret.

No, the buff la is a more
---
Your a god
---
*is free* *and it came from supercell*
---
no. some people wanna play the mode normally and depend on skill, not a random drop that buffs your character to god-like abilities briefly. 
---
Jeez not even i did that with jessie.....
---
****i dare you to take that out of context -_-****
---
legit played 30 matches and got big brawler once
---
argh is the gif broken?
---
After their current match, have a few people watch the replay of the reported player and if they see that they are teaming they hold a vote that is unanimous, if it isn't they watch again to confirm if still not unanimous, majority is the ruling. This would be like Jury Duty in the USA but the second part after watching a second time would be different.

Reality can be whatever I want.

Great without meteors

I doubt that you can make better one

I would normally agree with you but I got my Brock a decent amount by doing this, I got him to 565 trophies just with randoms, when I initially had him at 450.

Thats not me though.

1 legendary for 500 gems? What is a deal to you?
---
I mean I’m at 11.5k since you want too know so bad and if u don’t believe me I’ll join whatever band your in too prove it but that’s trash compared too the best of ladder but as a f2p it ain’t bad and i actually have played against Marley and talked amongst some of the biggest names in brawl stars in been in there bands sure I don’t personally know them or play with them but I still have knowledge of who they are and at one point i was on local for a lil while and I could probably get back up there if I just had all brawlers
---
how so?
---
No he’s fine. He’s no worse than most other characters. 
---
It doesn’t stack? This situation is worse than I thought!
---
Removing the play button
---
Perhaps in terms of strategy. However, it is the only 1v1 mode out there so I take what I can get. To me, Showdown was a fun, simple mode where I didnt have to rely on teammates and could use any character and do well. Now, Supercell just took that away from me and made my pushing a lot more difficult
---
Sneak 100
---
So we're doing the choking Sasuke meme, but with Poco.
---
I think I use the same picture editor
---
What’s an IKE?
---
On every brawler there should be icons which show the skins you have. So you can flex all brawler skins
---
I go on a losing streak whenever Cavern Churn pops up. I hate it with a passion. Because the only way to reliable win for me in Solo is to play with a Bull and Shelly all day long.
---
Eel?
---
Fucking me too dude
---
Two entire teams begin to spin and take out each safe then they turn on each other when the time comes.

Me too man I got all brawlers but mythical and legendaries. I got 5600 trophies idk what to do now :(
---
This man and his team as well
---
Whaaat? Did you make buy anything from the shop? I don’t even have any epics ahah, that’s at a 0.5 chance
---
Idk i enjoy this combo
---
Spiky lettuce
---
But have you played with them for a while ? Have you played at the top of the ladder ? 800-900 brawlers? Have you even been in a game room with them. My point is you have no idea who any of these players are and after seeing a video of them spinning with eachother you just assume “ wintrading”. I’m trying to tell people that they are not win trading because I know all of these players personally. 
---
Wait so by your logic I should always hit the person closest to me and showcase my aggression toward another opponent for no reason potentially wasting my shots on him for no reason instead of conserving my shots for someone which I'm much more confident to take out?
---
So if 2 throwers see each other the first thing they should do by your logic is start throwing shots at each other because it is against the game rules not to do so?
---
It does not always mean that if 2 brawlers did not decide to hit you means that they are teaming. It just does not make sense for the 2 throwers to start destroying each other and risk losing trophies when they can confidently defeat you. They might not be teaming against you but it is just in their best interest to not go for each other because you are the easier target. You video did not show the full gameplay to prove that they were teaming.
---
I'm 100% against teaming but that does not mean I should try and kill every nearest person I see in showdown. 
---
Es mi usuario de brawl stars xd,no entendía muy bien cómo se usaba,no sé si hablas español pero bueno
---
I have 5600 trophies no mythical no legendaries

Yes! It’s a great free editing app for phones

How long ago? Crow used to be good at Heist but he's bad at the new maps
---
Asshole for teaming though
---
Haha I actually never read the description of the game mode, I just went and did. I just played lol
---
Yeah, probaly the best

Oh ya the good old times
---
thanks!
---
&amp;#x200B;

tysm!

Je ne parle pas français

Yeah, probably the best 
---
Welcome to the game! Hope you have a great time!
---
Courtesy: Brawl start crap server.
---
Fuck you for teaming, go to duo showdown if you want team. Rather, just play the other modes, you’ll get a team 
---
I tried to make her as different as I could, so im glad that was apparent
---
Bull got a shot of before Shelly used her super, and then Shelly didn't back away as she used her shot right after her super, so she died. Bad play by the Shelly more than anything, but credit to the Bull for getting in that crucial shot before Shelly used her super.
---
We can't let it die ok. Pls give upvote or we'll lose what we care about. Thank
---
i wasnt aware of that, thx for the info! ill be sure to keep that in mind for my next post
---
Removing all buttons 
---
But it changed from mostly ftp to full ptw 
---
Well it’s not like poco can die from suffocation
---
Looks good. He's a fun character to draw. So is frank
---
did not use a doubler here hey
---
Depending on the game mode and opposing brawlers, breaking walls is actually useful Doe
---
have you ever played crow in solo showdown? at all? 
---
"I, Sandman3600, state the following: Crow, with his pitiful damage and 4 poison ticks, can destroy my enemies in solo showdown by poking people until they just leave."
---
When I got crow I used him in solo showdown a ton to try to get him to work but either I'd be surrounded by brawlers all behind a wall to try and get an easy pick or I'd be 2nd place and what do you know there's a Leon with 10 powerups or a Primo aiming his super at me.
---
Why would a character whose main benefit is 4 ticks of low poison damage dominate showdown? Even if you did get a kill, there's a big chance there was someone else third-partying on you, and when you poke at them they run in, grab the power cubes, loose a shot at you and run off to heal somewhere.
---
What does mark a meta mean? 
---
Does brawler rank make any difference? 
---
How are players matched ? With trophies or power points or rank?
---
Haha all good, I’ve backstabbed a ton and lost more trophies than I’ve won but it’s worth it! Lol
---
The spike plush is so cute haha 
---
Fake news, the game never delivers. I've spent over $130 on Brawlstars and still only have 23 brawlers.
---
How is it not a bug?
---
If I get backstabbed by another backstabber before I have the chance to backstab them. First I wipe a prideful tear from my cheek then I slow clap because they're making Showdown a better place..... unlike teamers who are ruining it.
---
Facts 😂
---
That's how Brawl Star works🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️

That wasn’t removed completely just needed significantly

Especially with bull amirite

Hi tell me what am I supposed to do in this situation.  I had been playing with my team for 30+ mins, I queue into the game like I would with any other, and Elit is just throwing and spinning the entire time?  I don’t see how I’m at fault here when I can’t control matchmaking.  No I didn’t tell him to queue up at the same time as me, I’ve talked to Elit like once before.  I tried to play the game normally but I guess that’s not good enough.  So if there is some special way to prove that I’m not win trading please tell me and I’ll do it next time this happens because these bullshit posts are offensive to competitive players.  The only thing that interests me about the game right now is siege and competitive play, win trading in BS isn’t a thing it’s just idiots solo queueing and throwing.
---
Wait, you spent money on this crap?
---
This has gone way too far lmao
---
Thanks a lot, it's very difficult, all my brawlers have 300 trophies, when my friends win a brawler I'm happy and sad, happy for them to win and sad because I did not win much time, I play since the launch for Android, I play a long time, it would take the supercell to give me a brawler soon, because I'm sincerely getting very discouraged
---
This was a tf2 joke
---
Look how they massacred my boy
---
Get up to 10000 trophies/ unlock nothing/ friend has all legendaries at 10 trophies./friend has all legendaries at 10 trophies🌚
---
Yeah, but I never got the 24th brawler
---
Here, try it
---
We’ve reached the point if no return lol
---

True true
---
You are not the only one who hates that map, I dont hate it, I mega hate it, i hate it even more with the meteors
---
I decided to make it 25%. Lets put it into context to see why (Assuming these brawlers are maxed):
---
all 3 knives land: (3 x 392) x 1.0 = 1176 damage
---
all 3 knives land with 10% buff: (3 x 392) x 1.1 = 1294 damage
---
all 3 knives land with 25% buff: (3 x 392) x 1.25 = 1470 damage
---
Lets say you're playing with a brock on your team:
---
1 rocket: 1540 damage
---
1 rocket with 10% buff: 1540 x 1.1 = 1694 damage
---
1 rocket with 25% buff: 1540 x 1.25 = 1925 damage
---
See how much more dangerous crow can become? Keep in mind that he is a legendary so he should deserve this. The lowest I would say would be 15% if you're picky
---
christmas skins too
---
Bruh they get trophies for winning so it isn't a friendly match. Are u dumb
---
Lol that's also my beef with this ship
---
Update 0.2016
---
I want Lex to choke me
---
We adapt too 😈 . That's why I never make a b-line. I play it cool like I'm loyal. Pop off a few attacks at some other people, but keep my ammo up. I never make a real effort to kill anyone while I'm "teaming". Just play along and gain trust. Then when the time is right... I STRIKE! I even let a teamer pick up a power cube once just to get them in close. 
---
Oof sry didn't see till the end 
---
    -_-
---
The brawler takes 25% more damage so yes, all brawlers do more damage to the poisoned brawler
---
More balanced: Up to 3 daggers can stack at once. 
---
*i see that the matchmaking works*
---
My tools ain’t buffoons
---
SWIPE FOR MORE OBJECTS

I don’t know how good you are at the game, but I think Mortis should be S tier for gem grab. So incredibly meta right now and I’m seeing him super strong up at the 13k range. Love the rest though!

He already dead inside

No gems, free-to-play player

Can we get an f in the chat for our fallen comrade

Do you llike season 8? I love it its so amazing! 🤩🤩
---
Since beta???! How many trophies do you have??
---
Interesting concept but I think it would be better with launch pads to get back to the outside
---
Petition denied
---
Nice. Felt pity for those guys.
---
btw where's El Primo?
---
Harder daddy
---
Better idea: All forms of healing, not just passive healing, are prevented while poisoned. Includes supers that heal, star powers that heal, anything. 
---
its okay, im glad you ask :Đ   
---
pam, nita and nitas bear on the very left   
---
kairos time and lex on the couch playing games with jessie and penny behind   
---
colt and shelly in the middle with ryan, frank from supercell and leon on the right   
---
behind them are dyna and spike huggin coach cory  
---
last but not least, bull sleeping on the right ;P 
---
Depends, if you are ftp i’ll say buy token doubler, however buy it, it’s worth it
---
Jesse is broken op in big game
---
It's a bear that stand in a spring trap
---
So Acurrate
---
Guess i will f myself
---
F
---
I got nothing :( bunch of coins and power points
---
lets be bad-at-colouring buddies lol :P  
---
( thanks again, you made my day thousands time better &lt;3 &lt;3 )
---
:((( but, next time you’ll have more and more chances to have a brawler !
---
I like the first concept however I don’t really think it’s ideal for the last 2 teams to have a team ffa. The gameplay can’t make a switch so suddenly. But regardless Great idea. I’m on board
---
So whens the poco nerf
---
That's also one of the reasons immunity sucks, the other being too OP if you manage to super stack
---
I bought it too, it is worth it in my opinion 
---
that seems very balanced
---
but wouldn't tanks be the only viable brawlers
---
Ohh ok that happens with me too
---
Haha my post of nerfing Jesse got downvoted. Glad your post has upvotes and I totally agree with it. I wish I could upvote it a thousand times. Jesse is way to OP in some maps/modes
---
I think so
---
Your criticism is much appreciated; any polite advice or criticism might help more than you think. I worked hard on this one, but sadly I couldn't achieve what I had in mind. I lack in the painting/coloring and shading area and I am trying to practice it and improve it. 
---
Sorry then
---
He doesn't have to though, does he? Even if it's the immoral thing to do, you can't do anything against it and you're basically trying ti karma farm as you won't get anywhere with this.
---
I'd like that, pretty good stuff
---
I Do It too! I have 1000 token doubler so I'm farming a lot of chests 
---
I think they can add it like in clash royale.
---
Missions which will refresh over period and by completing some quests, get a brawl box 
---
This will increase in the game involvement 
---
Gonna report the guy. BTW is the Picture of the video (phoenix crow spike and leon) is yours? CAUSE I F\*\*\*ING LOVE IT (and everything alse)
---
Yeah no shit, it's almost like we all got it

I think you guys are asking for a little too much... I think they'd be able to do this is 2 months worth of big updates 
---
Darryl is so op that sc removed him from drops
---
24s match
---
Man u could just record last 5 seconds; so annoying
---
If you look at the spawns carefully, you'll see that everybody has their own bushes and you won't get ambushed by a bull if you just enter the closest bush. You cannot go around the map like you can in Cavern Churn or Island Invasion. Plus the bushes will help Pipers with star power.
---
You may have got disconected 
---
1big 32 minis
---
Oops
---
*wait*
---
Yeah but I thought it always spawned where you stood
---
Not a bug.. if u have max Brock . His starpower will charge that piece letting
---
Jessie is balanced ? Lol😳
---
Bounce can’t be dodge sometimes. It depends on the map and the random player behaviour. 
---
It’s not balanced.

---
maybe you got extra? sometimes I'll get points towards one brawler with 12 gold sometimes 
---
Supercell, please.
---
I got 31 barley. That count as extra?
---
Play more to learn dodging and aiming better, when you improve you will naturally get more trophies. Also you can hide/team in showdown or get a group of friends and play 3 v 3s.
---
Last week i had 14 brawl boxes, i just started, and i was tempted to open them. F.
---
Now i started again, i have almost 20 normal 2 big
---
Credit to u/Jasun101 for the idea ig
---
0.1 actually
---
Like me
---
I agree I only have 1150 trophies and I play against Bo and Dynamike
---
I played a game today and we were one point ahead and my teammate was on 100 health left about to get hit with a couple seconds left so I acted as a meat shield and we won
---
Oh yeah, turning up the BOOM BOX!
---
# BULLDOZER!

Do you  know that or just thinking?

tanks don't have range, cant hit anything.  its ranged ones like piper colt and brock etc that are good at shooting from far and gaining health. pam  can do ok.
---

It’s called flair and you need to be on pc version
---
I got -49 for my crow in this fuckin map 
---
It's still a buff, be grateful because a lot of brawlers were nerfed in the last patch

thank you bo

Very yuugee
---
Can confirm 
---
So a wink is sexual now ? Wtf
---
Don't mess with my crew 
---
U got a downvoted......
---
So I upvoted u
---
thats a good idea but it would turn out to be less than 0.25 boxes a day, so yeah, not much
---
gets destroyed by ranged units,gets destroyed by bulls and shellies too. if you can dodge enough you can take out some throwers that's probably it.
---
no thanks
---
No, he eats the gems. The vitamins in those give him enough dopamine to jump into the enemy spawn with 10 gems.
---
What? 
---
Face palm
---
But why only no skin and golden barley why not wizzard barley too
---
Great, let's make Brawl Stars turn into a P2W hell-hole!
---
I never got him in 2017
---
i think it takes long enough to max all brawlers as is, imagine having to spend 23 \* 1250 \* 10 or more coins again...
---
It was supposed to be a one way map where if you use the spring pad, you can't get back. 
---
What the fuck did you just bring upon this cursed land
---
Downvoted so that others don't see this and I can do this in my next match
---
He is very helpful in 3v3 and best for heist 
---
Story of my life 
---
And have 1000 trophies...
---
If its remade, it will be a thrower map, so im sticking with remove (don't reply me if im Bull) 
---
"Hey, you broke my guitar! It's alright, i'll just find another one!" *He then proceeds to open a big box as countless guitars pour from it.*
---
Upvoted for the pun.
---
200 gems for 1.5k trophies 
---
Yes, please
---
fLAiR CheCKs oUt
---
COOL IDEA
---
Mega box is only like a 12% chance for a super rare, also, instead of getting mega boxes get token doublers unless the mega box is  49. Mega boxes have 10x the  rewards as a brawl box
---

Yuck no

After the update, Darryl does not roll for a long time, he flies out of the water
---
Wow that's a terrifying thing to think about.

?

yeah it's like that one scene from sponge bob where squidward has 700 alarm clocks in his cupboard and just gets a new one when spongebob breaks one.
---
How many times i have to tell you 
---
NO REPOSTS
---
how is this a proof ?
---
It's just two random screen
---
I’m pretty sure it should also work with golden barley too. 
---
I would be hard to make it go above bushes because it would look real weird if they through it near an edge of a bush. 
---
Does it have to?
---
You opened it then got another. Siege timer is 1:40 and gem grab is 1:40 also. r/quityourbullshit
---
Yes Zaddy
---
old poco

what?

So this is why I see blank names of brawler names in showdown 
---
Im at 6000 and I don't have  a single mythic
---
Look at my star tokens I did one battle it reset it and gave me one
---
no, I just really like his playstyle
---
I missed out on a big screenshot ... when it was me on Spike, teamed with Jesse, Jesse, Jesse and Jesse facing Jesse.
---
My thumbs weren't fast enough. Damn shame.
---
Thanks Bro enjoying it so far 😁
---
I just gave 75th upvote and suddenly this is at 1k?
---
look at your normal token,

you had 0 now you have 60 after one game ?
---
are you 12?

I can hear this picture

It isn’t photoshopped

No I didn’t I completely lost it

Oh yes and be sure to stand at point blank range to intimidate them

Thank you!

So this would be even more liek Fortnite? It would probably cost like 20€, so maybe not...

Wow finally cool bull player. Almost every bull is stupid but not this one❤️❤️ well played

at least you did not start playing with Chinese people and lost trophies because of the lag
---
I'm at 7k and have 300 trophy brawlers and I've been facing people with 500 trophy brawlers that are at 10k total and star power while I have no brawler with star power
---
No bushes were checked in the making of this video
---
If the enemy can somehow sneak and destroy your IKE ( 5% is not much), then haha. Your level 41 robot is garbage
---
Maybe win as big brawler twice or survive 3 mins in robo rumble? That way randoms could get the quests too
---
Rather have bots

When you lose 10 trophies from playing siege with randoms
---
You can do that but its not easy cups, also notice that you won 😛
---
Issa dimple yall
---
Sure?
---
Buenas noches 
---
If feel the opposite
---
rico chet.
---
Damn, that happens?
---
Meta
---
I don’t need to be thinking about this at 3am
---
Yes no ban pls
---
Why do they make other players lose trophies? If they want to lose trophies, play SD and get 10th place. SC should do something about these kind of players who wintrade. This will not be good for future
---
Gene is not actually thicc tho, you just make him Thicc
---
The problem is with bushy maps is that auto aim makes it almost impossible to react unlike back in portrait there was no auto aim so even in bushy maps you had a chance as if the enemy had poor aim you could escape 
---
Yeah that makes sense but yo d still do that over randoms because you know the team comp and can make a decent one
---
“Chances are they will get a ban” actual dumbass right here
---
I play with randoms for 5 months now because they really aren’t that bad. And it gets keys quickly. 
---
This from 13000 player 
---
Darryl gets the best skins
---
yes, I just entered the game and started to appear, I did not change my location in the game.
---
Auto aiming piper super
---
Why always everyone makes trash prizes for f2p guys
---
Yea no problem. Good luck brawling!
---
When you open trillion boxes and cant even get a single power point for your favorite brawler.
---
Omg rico on this map
---
“What literally bush means”.....this makes me cringe.
---
Interesting 
---
"Showdown moved exclusively to the 2nd slot, some of the maps have active modifiers
---
Siege added to the 4th slot"...........I can't see 2 showdown maps at a time.😭😭 It's disgusting.

Best Darryl skin I’ve ever seen

Looks on point, well done ✌🏽

Springs in Heist will be op.

This puts a smile on my face too

They could factor in brawler level as well I guess, although that doesn’t happen to me unless I play with a friend irl that’s low level

---
&gt;Despite their specific brawler being the same trophy range, someone at 10,000 trophies vs someone at 1,000 is a mismatch.
---
I mean, if you play your main sooooooo well (like, you have similar experience in other games) there's no point at preventing 1000 trophies vs 10000 trophies matchup.
---
And with that formula we can ensure real fair matchmaking (so less smurf vs newbie matchup)
---
Hol up
---
Ah, ok thanks
---
 When I was a kid, I dressed in a doll clothe and I felt like being something. I just wanted to express it on painting, feeling like the strongest and strongest. with Dinosaur clothes 
---
lol just play practice
---
I mean, casual matchmaking can be loose, but ranked matchmaking should be more serious.
---
that's reason of shadow :)
---
I quite like the idea of having a full width blockade with only jump pads to get across. It also means there's different play styles towards the end when people have slowly dismantled the wall with their supers
---
It’s different depending on the country you’re in (they make it as hard as possible) but look up “google ads” while signed in to your google account and go from there. You should be able to find some sort of terms and conditions or privacy policy. 
---
r/subredditsarelikehashtags
---
Yes in the long rum but the game is about quick matches.... so there is not a long run.... lol mortis was broken in brawl ball they did right by nerfing him there and buff his damage so he is playable in others modes
---
Yo fortnite is better
---
That 2 seconds flying together was like that classic cartoon chase scene where both of the characters wait awkwardly on a elevator to then continue the persecution
---
That’s true, though it’s only effective if you pick up more than one 
---
Piper got a flintlock umbrella, wheres the sniper?
---
You say that like it's an achievement 
---
Ty! One day I hope they do a brawler contest so I can submit
---
I would play matches far far more often if the trophy losses were less severe. Winning a match can be immediately offset by losing, and you end up with zero trophies, if not fewer. It's almost as if winning is worthless.
---
Concept and art are mine, I have not copied anyone💪
---
Very impressive! Fantastic teamwork and team comp. GG!
---
8k
---
It's fake :)
---
I love how simply straightforward this post is, just a bunch of images and a few equal signs.
---
Also, regarding the suggestion, this is an improvement from getting one extra star token a week (practically 3 extra star tokens for three weeks) to a half-mega box in those three weeks.
---
What I like about this is that it's not a demanding suggestion, it's a reasonable one, yet it's still rewarding for the players. I'm really hoping that this idea would be considered for implementation. Kudos to you OP. 
---
thx ^^)b
---
AAAAAAARGH! RUN FOR YOUR LIVES!!!
---
Anyways, looking great!
---
They should enable it already, we are willing to pay for it.
---
...although the could simply change the colours back to the fancy neon ones those pastel colours look out of place.
---
Cost: 500 gems
---
...I realized it only now
---
No, that would be pay to win. Cool idea, don’t think it will happen.
---
Jokes aside piper is op
---
Lmao so true.
---
Dino Darryl?
---
Why u keep surprising me? This is awesome af
---
Exactly. Life leech was 99 (arguable 100) % effective at preventing teaming
---
lmao why would it be achievement if im better than you
---
Balancing this way is complicated and would result in some brawlers being too OP... plus it makes the game more complicated to learn
---
My point still stands
---
Or Llelly
---
He gave up and we already won the match practically, LET'S FOLLOW HIM, WHAT COULD BE WRONG?
---
Wizard - Barley
---
Elec Wizard - Jessie
---
Ice Wizard - Umm..spike?

I think

Nice map! A bit like Island Invasion with a bit more interesting features to hide around, which is cool
---
The best idea !

6+8+4 = 18

I love it!!!
---
I hate losing when people have teamed up against me. However, if the opportunity presents itself, I will of course join an opportunity to team. If the losses weren't so drastic on Showdown, then more people would take the risk and go it alone. I played a match the other day where no-one teamed - honestly it was so fun! Everyone trying to fight to the bitter end, It's what it should be about!
---
Scary. Love it
---
BO was the first brawler I bought from the shop with chips back in the beta version of the game. I was excited to finally get an epic brawler and fast forward a year or so he's now in trophy road feelsbadman :(
---
For his shovel, i think he should hold a violin, but other than that, it looks pretty cool!

Yes you are

And make the game even more pay to win?

From what I’ve seen, matchmaking goes off trophies, and yea the power is at 10, but the trophies are in range with each other.

못그리겠다면 툴의 힘을 빌리세요 가끔 저도 동그라미가 어려우면 동그라미그리기 툴을 쓴답니다 :)
---
May be make a gene skin next
---
Boa ideia, cara :)
---
Someone is still gonna find another exploit
---
Hee hee. Dino-Mike. That needs to become a thing. 
---
lol take my upvote
---
r/Brawlmap
---
Why is this token logo like Riot Games' one xd
---
I really like the idea, but supercell does not allow maps with 1 tile spaces, because some of the larger brawlers have trouble squeezing through
---
Wait is this gem grap? I mean nice map 
---
But WTF 😂
---
Tunisian both teams had a 100% on the safe. It would make no sense for your team to “give up” or stop playing. I can understand if you were about to lose but what you guys did here is blatant cheating. You stopped playing at the beginning to ensure the other team won the game. You’re a cheater and a liar. And this video proves it. This is not the first time you’ve cheated. Players like you deserve to be banned from the game. I hope SC does the right thing here and suspend or ban the players involved 
---
🥕 툴을 써야죠 ㅋㅋ
---
저는 그림 밑에 두고 따라그리는거밖에 못해요 ㅠㅠ
---
Oh Im stupid Now I see the heists
---
Her best mode it definitely brawl ball, if you use her super with Frank, you will demolish everything.  She is alright in  due showdown.  Best plan is to chip from behind walls.
---
This is why i say they need to punish teamers. They can literally make it so you cant get a star token.
---
I like the name
---
Exactly :)
---
This is acceptable to me. Fuck Dynamike.
---
I had .1 before I spent money. It’s not hard to get 
---
Am I missing something here? Is the joke that teaming is comparable with a trash can? 
---
We delete the current Island Invasion and add this with the same name.
---
I would love to work for supercell when I grow up
---
They made all my childhood funs 😍🙂
---
I don't understand this whole fuss about jessie. Personally, i find Nita to be a much more challenging big brawler
---
안보고 따라그리시는 습관을 길러야 해요. 가장 쉬운 방법은 따라그릴 그림에 십자선을 그리고 대충 감으로 그려보는 거예요. 그림이 늘어나려면 연습이 최고예요.
---
Trolling or Scamming
---
Is it weird that I want to play this map?
---
God
---
(I think it's bounty)
---
Thank you for putting it the nice way. This map is infuriating
---
Is the price tag a joke too?
---
I just came here to say... Buff Crow.
---
The green background is so cool with a new brawler. Well done man👍
---
No... NOTHING is better than night witch mortis...
---
But for real, night witch mortis is the only skin I've ever bought lol!
---
Looks ok
---
Yeah ive had it so i shoot 3 times and the delay makes them all come out at once
---
It is, i am still confused with the names of the gamemodes in english sorry
---
Golden helmet is better to him
---
Complimerd... complimenti?😅😂
---
🙂연습하고 안돼는거는 없어요😁
---
You're right going to fix that
---
Grazzieeeeee
---
PEW! PEW! PEW!
---
Hey JoKeR i today played brawl ball in your team
---
Omg👌😂
---
I mean yeah, but Crow really does need a buff.
---
Loving how it says that your DAILY challange is to open 5 boxes when you can get 2 a day😂
---
Ma il tuo animale preferito è la foca?
---
Hmmmm🤔🤔🤔
---
Read all the text i dont wanna play with bots or coordinate with other 5 people just for play a couple of games until one leaves
---
why are there only 8 spawns? also, jokes aside, i would only play Piper on this map
---
Che significa hmmmmm
---
You do know that even if he is talented he still needs a degree in arts right? It's not like they say " ohh look 10 more cool concepts let's hire them all. It is still a profesion and they are required some things. It's not a rant it's just my opinion on the matter. 
---
This is actually a useful petition
---
Wow, bad luck to you
---
Its pretty low. I got my first legendary at 0.2112%
---
All credit for the skin concept to u/GEDI-KOR , don't focus on the collage, I am focusing more that him working with Supercell could lead to amazing brawler and skin concepts etc.
---
My game name is FacebookJoe
---
Nevermind, it was the same concept but with diferent wording. My bad.
---
Do you remember
---
perhaps star power, but 99% crow fans just want buff his stats. this meme is about them
---
... 
---
Up close, sorry that you're mistaking Crow for Piper, you see, assassins are usually better at close range, that's why they're quick ;)
---
No i need my points to go to gene an extra brawler means lower chances of getting points for gene
---
He replied 1hr before you said this
---
I love all of his work, I'm amazed by the quality of skins that are made
---
In today’s world, portfolio is more important than degree. A degree is helpful, but not as much as a killer portfolio. 
---
WoW. You are right... upvote to let this thing come out
---
His skins are so much better then the real ones
---
If you want to be a game designer you can join my company that make horror games (my brother does all the coding)
---
Cavern churn is way worse imo
---
The other version is with 10 coins.
---
Why do not you make your own idea of ​​some Brawler? Greetings I hope you take into account my opinion 
---
This is undertale
---
pretty sad the kids on thsi sub dont realize drawing a single static picture like he does is literally nothing even remotely similar to making 3d models with texture budgets.
---
Ummm.. do people auto aim brock’s super? I’ve never done that..
---
Mee too bro
---
I want a complete hostory of brawl stars detailed
---
That too
---
and gedi-kor work rom his house 
---
Lol 😂
---
This looks fun
---
Wouldn't this be a copyright strike from Nintendo?
---
And also you know this isn’t a ‘discussion’. All the comments as you can already see are just “yeah I agree”. That’s not what a discussion is
---
Don’t worry dude, these memes are all just fun and games. None of us actually hate the supercell art team and we all know the effort they put into the game. It’s all just fun little jokes
---
PS love your art
---
Oh god
---
Bruh, seriously, why Supercell hasn't hired you yet? 
---
You're so talented and creative. If all of your skins were in the game they would make TONS of $$ on them, for sure. 
---
Hahaha I've been playing since beta launch
---
Lol but if you lose so much trophies why don't you just stop playing?
---
I recently unlocked my first above super rare, gene!
---
What if Gene is a dead Colt?
---
But what happens when you use super with Carl and someone spins back. 
---
I need Ninja Cat Tara, like right now
---
But it would be nice!
---
i need to showoff my loaded rico :v 
---
O ridurre il tempo di attesa dei token
---
What you don't have an epic but you have a mythic? xD 
---
I got Pam and Tara but no Legendaries 
---
friggin jerks
---
Ur skins r better than all the skins supercell made. Damn you’re creative 
---
Mortis gang rise up
---
They need to throw a skin or two into there. It’ll make people really grind for it then
---
SUUUUB BOOOOOT
---
And then it’s perfect
---
Matchmaking is based off of trophies, not power level
---
u/GEDI-KOR Made a chicken crow idea, that’s where the comment is from
---
I can tell that it’s a joke, but next time include a /s so others can detect the sarcasm.
---
You’re both wrong. That’s Mortis!
---
Really? It's been just sometime since this was posted and see GEDI's thread. BTW, had enough of arguing with you.
---
I already find it, but thanks
---
Wait a crow killing a Leon isn’t a bug?
---
**can only weajen brawlers in showdown
---
MENTLEGEN
---
Deal with what? If a new player doesn’t enjoy the game because he or she doesn’t like going up against players with star powers? I would say that’s pretty dramatic 
---
[https://imgur.com/a/b4LuLTh](https://imgur.com/a/b4LuLTh)
---
I see. Obviously it would be easy for someone above 2k who has more skill than someone underneath 2k. Just my opinion though.
---
You win
---
Complaining about randoms because you suck
---
That's why Im saving up for vault defender, it's the easiest to get tokens on
---
Terry Crews as El Primo
---
I think he’s being sarcastic
---
oh god help him
---
We're just at opposite ends of believing a team with all three star powers vs a team of level 6's is a huge power difference or not. Fine to disagree but personally if I got railed into the ground after going against level 10's over and over I'd get annoyed. 
---
But you are Barley
---
You GUYS ARE WRONG!! IT'S POCO!
---
I want deleted hot point.
---
SO PIPER WAS THE HAT THIEF!
---
Or you know,they could just bring life leech back.
---
and bring back hot maze
---
Especially in art related stuff, degree is the last thing you need lol. Combine that with the fact that a ton of tech companies don't care if you have a degree, unless you're on the front lines of advancing biotech/ hardware/ big data processing etc shit
---
Shally
---
No he isn't 
---
The best map idea I have seen
---
#B.        O         O          M
---
Me: people need to stop teaming in showdown 
---
Supercell: *Makes Carl's super/special*
---
Me: You had one job
---
I have got Spike,Mortis,Piper and Pam but I doesn't have Rico or darryll
---
help
---
No thats shelly u unaducated patatos
---
This breaks rule 2 of this subreddit. Surprised the mods haven't removed this yet.
---
He should look kind of like Shaco from
---
League of Legends (look it up if you dont know who I'm talking about), with a jester hat.
---
Such a great work, hire him
---
The entire sub is sore losers. It's so objective,I don't know how you're supposed to police it. They'll be perfectly ok if you and another guy kill the Bull with 12 gems, but some reason you should kill each other immediately after. 
---
Darryl is one of the best brawlers in the game, you should learn how to play the game
---
But now everyone already has him...
---
New brawler confirmed!? (Leaked) [not fake]
---
Touchdown Bull was a skins concept from all the way back in 2017 I believe
---
Waitin for GEDI-KOR comment btw
---
We need clown, kimono, fri 13 and rockstar. Ingame. 
---
It’s good that someone said it. And finally we could have a chance at getting some cool skins!
---
Not gonna lie, supercell would make a load of money off of implementing skin ideas this guy has.. And hiring him
---
no
---
Git Gud
---
Does he even live in Helsinki?
---
HOLY CROW
---
they are remodeling every remaining brawlers, frank (brawl team lead) tweeted out on twitter
---
SORRY NOOB -COWBOY BOI
---
MRS. OBAMA GET DOWN!
---
makes sense
---
What's behind the blurryness
---
All these newbies love siege to death cuz of all the trophies... bruh
---
Tell where do I sign right now 
---
who bets 20 tickets on big game anyways? far less rewarding than robo rumble..
---
10/10
---
u/GEDI-KOR 2020
---
She reminds me of pearl from Steven universe
---
Amazing tier shitpost
---
this is true.  
---
the only flaw that allows pay to win have a sniff at this game... I'm not complaining though. I figure if you have some skill, you can still beat them.
---
I am in an allies club so everyone is active
---
You probably took this video before the update 
---
Haha you are just salty your map designs aren’t as good as gedis skins?
---
clearly it's Carl....Early release to this user only o.0
---
I should take it as a complimet or as a offense? 
---
*another round?*
---
an absolute unit
---
They patched it?
---
This is me. Also the good randoms leave when they win
---
or just change the colours back to the old ones... i really liked the dark red but now it looks pink-ish
---
omg
---
Haha that's my favorite Heist map. Went on winning streak with Nita recently on that map, dropping the bear right on the safe almost guarantees the win since enemies don't spawn right on their safe.
---
Same. If Shelly has her Super, she wins. If she doesn't, Bull wins. Really unfair when their are so many bushes.
---
Want to get legendary
---
Penny's shot has a new look so no this video is after the update
---
Yes, or a colorful top hat
---
Nooooo.. this is mu best map
---
Great!!!
---
I like the idea but those quests seem a little out of balance. You only get 240 tokens a day unless you level or rank up (or play ticket events) so opening 5 boxes in a day is very hard unless it’s the weekend. Still something I hope supercell adds!
---
Dude that’s terrible...
---
There’s no one block gaps anymore. Make em’ two blocks and you’re good to go. 
---
*d e d*
---
Canteam
---
Nah it'll only match with other players who have selected casual 
---
OH
---
A very good petition, his work is incredible. Supercell is in desperate need of someone like him
---
I messed up the names, no need to downvote me lol
---
Wtf no
---
Ecco perché Bombardino lancia bottiglie (forse proprio di quel liquore) 
---
Clean true
---
when this map is available I always use rico to gain something like 20 - 30 trophies
---
Don't worry I didn't give you anything. If someone's downvoting you I'll give you an upvote lol
---
Man, I was banned not because of gene, but due to the fact that several people played on my account
---
Supercell for gods sake sign this man onto the Brawl Stars team
---
The "past version" of the word "put" is put, not putted
---
And if we are maxed out?
---
Sorry, I am italian 
---
could be that it goes through walls but not crystals. 
---
Cavern Church maybe. Don’t know Spanish 
---
bro u got a piper comment fetish or something
---
Annedoto : Bombardino nella versione inglese è Barley, che in Italiano significa Orzo. Ma senti Supercell puoi fare una traduzione decente? 
---
Mortis going in rounds then penny mortar?
---
he is not a tank so he doesn´t need a lot of healt, hes damage is very high if you are close enough (so he can break power boxes easily), and the reason to play him instead of Bull is that Bull is a no-skill shitgunner. He is not useless with his star power, the star power just makes him OP
---
\#NerfBull
---
Cat tara and primo are the 2 that i dont like but otherwise neat and hell yeah
---
spirits of ancestors 
---
16 but on my mini on my main i played two games of siege when it was firt time released and lost both and now when is siege i don't playing it bcz i don't want do lose 10 trophies and it's worst gamemode
---
Good job! Really nice!
---
Yep, its bad.
---
probably
---
Yeah jump pads ruined the whole game, is just annoying they should keep it only in Siege
---
Giaaà
---
Agree!
---
Annedoto perfettoh
---
ask support about detail of what you received 
---
Yeah that
---
Needs some more stuff
---
I posted same 2 days ago
---
I stopped playing siege with randoms, I don’t even play it without a full group
---
Shouldn’t he just apply?
---
Putted
---
It's just Darryl
---
I go to hide in a bush only to find out there's someone hiding in another bush on the opposite side of a wall and then we both start losing health...no thanks
---
 👏👏👏👏
---
The one time Shelly uses her super on a wall
---
It's just Darryl...
---
Good job! I would like to see this skin
---
Bro van a meter un nuevo brawler que se llama Carl, es un minero que lanza su pico como ataque normal y su ataque especial empieza a girar como una peonza exactamente como tu dijiste 😂😂😂😂😂
---
Weird flex
---
yep
---
Why doesn't he appear (at least for me) in the unlocked brawlers
---
Pewdiepie will defeat T-series with the leon he'll get from that box
---
Phew
---
If all of your skins concept come in game, I'm buying all of them!!!
---
Da fuk
---
Hmmm...ik pretty sure i saw this exact drawing 2 minutes ago
---
Can u teach me pls
---
Boss went god mode
---
[When you try to team in solo showdown](https://imgur.com/gallery/OCdI1) 
---
Oeuf...
---
That's a map with a bug: el primo or mike with starpower can climb into the wall
---
🤣
---
We only make a temporarily alliance
---
Supercell has stated their [“stance”](https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/6rbaxi/status_report/)  on the topic before. They clearly are not discouraging it. I’m all for everybody not teaming but there are no perfect solutions as it is. OP’s idea is a terrible solution. 
---
I like the current meta and there really doesn’t need to be any substantial change.
---
I'm waiting for Pixelcrux to update their website and add spring traps so I have the best chance of getting my maps ingame! I learned not long ago that Supercell only allows Pixelcrux maps because it's easier to extract the file and actually test it.
---
Verohhh
---
U can’t go in the left of the map
---
Prize?
---
This skins should definitely make it into the game
---
new loading screen!!
---
You can’t have an unsymmetrical map lol
---
Teaming scum
---
Yes.It s difficult to create a map on o phone.I don't no what name to put,and I put that one.
---
Indeed
---
Oh a DNA molecule 😮
---
This is a great and funny idea
---
you should make one where Pam (mother) tells Jessie (daughter) that her turret dog is bad (because it hurts people = hate) while heal turrets are good (love).
---
I think same
---
It does you have to be skilled to get the gems and defend them in a safe manner. How many trophies do u have btw?
---
It's all random basically you kill a bull and another comes and fucks you up 
---
Its the sound effect Darryl makes when going Leroy Jenkins into a 1v3 scenario and still coming out victorious.
---
U right u right, mb. Dk why my brain was actin dumb lol. 
---
Yes, the end game has a lot of brawler in this map, and the big bushes remove a lot of space, but i ve played it with crow and work really well, i think wide spread brawler could be great because you can easly scout the bushes and everyone on the end will shoot to the guy in the middle
---
Yeah. Well fortnite used to ban people in the early days for swinging in the swings. AI isn't perfect and I think adding it in would lead to people getting banned even though they weren't teaming. Which would lead to more people complaining. This time about getting banned for no reason rather than the posts about teaming we already have.
---
Hell yeah, he makes such good skins!
---
Another concept i saw posted was you get +1 trophy per kill in showdown. +3 for being last man standing. or something similar. +1 trophy for each cube you get? idk haha
---
Darryl would be soooo op

I see a petition almost every day and roll my eyes at the weak ass attempt to either be funny or implement something that everybody has been asking for ages but just isn't important to SC for one reason or another.
---
This is probably the only petition that I will ever sign. SC does an amazing job with skins, a few were misses but overall we love their designs. But getting /u/GEDI-KOR on board as, at the very least, an intern would insert some fresh blood into how they go about deciding on skins. His skins are so far out of left field and so unique that they honestly should be honored that a kid with his vision and talent decided to us his gifts on their game.
---
Signed, notarized, and bribed.
---
Y'alls "talk show is on mute" been on mute to me for a long time. Shit 11 years nobody speaks to me about this stuff still when I know so many people know and told thousands of ppl during the previous 10 before the online stuff.
---
I low key ship this 
---
The point is they're hiring a 3d artist not a 2d one 
---
*All we want is Rockwall brawl or Thousand lakes*
---
Try prioretizing low hp targets and work with your team so you can finish off players they have weakened.
---
I just didn't like it....donno why
---
I lost 80 trophies there 😂
---
PRECISA URGENTE 
---
Uhm what are you going on about?
---
Yep, it's quite annoying too, but this happens just way too often
---
Autoaim
---
If you have a good team, it's funny❤️
---
Not that any of these are bad. I just dont care about them that much.   But ill do it for everyone else
---
Thank you so much for the tip 
---
It was there before

Just say “they” lol but he is a guy

got to add the purple dye

Mas oq é isso?
---
Hope you get well
---
Might have edited with PowerPoint...🤫
---
Thanks ❤️ 
---
Fr tho. That Leon skin looks so amazing and it’s not even based around an animal
---
I'm not sure but he does state he professionaly does graphic designs, which is very different than making game models. 
---
Poco where were you when i needed you?
---
Thanks man, but I'm not that good. The game started dropping me with teaming dynas and barleys right after this rip
---
Song?
---
r/uselessredcircle
---
Thanks 
---
I hope so too 
---
Why do you think he’s a genius?
---
it is. BUT he wouldn't need much practice to learn it.
---
In duos, he's great with brawlers like shelly, bull, primo,etc. However, I wouldn't pick him in solo.
---
Que dô
---
I'm also missing two epics. Good luck to you
---
You’re beyond delusional 🤷🏽‍♂️😭
---
you're welcomce buddy, hope you can play brawl stars again soon ^^
---
Supercell:"neither one..."
---
Nerf crow
---
True jajaja
---
He/she makes some E P I C and awesome art
---
Heck supercell HAS to such talented person :D
---
Good luck with him and have fun
---
This made me giggle way too much. 😉
---
Yeah I agree it isn’t that simple but from his comments he has some sort of experience with these kinds stuff. Of course he would have a low position but you can’t deny he makes great ideas
---
And just jump up into the air 
---
Jump and don't be scared
---
Wall-E 
---
Seems fun to play ! IMO it would be better without the wooden fences in the middle
---
Give me spike
---
Except for your super. If you use auto aim for leon’s super, you will probably miss
---
Hell yeah i would love to see my guy working for supercell pure talent right here he could make them so much money off of skins alone
---
The edited one looks actually very good! Nice job! ;)
---
Ok Thanks for the feed back
---
But then how will you experience the Soulcrushing sadness of opening a minimal reward box 35 times in a row.....?
---
*\*laughs in dashingly handsome\**
---
oh okay, but if the 3d models were made by him, then it'd be better. cause he made the concepts. that's all i could say
---
probably the worst map ive ever seen, how does it have 600 upvotes, do people actually think this would be fun 2 play on?
---
Agreed. Being able to donate power points would be awesome, as well as challenges.
---
5v5 sounds lit
---
Thanks! I'm planning to make another trampoline park map with a similar concept.
---
I always felt like Rico was too weak, he has barely no health and his attack is weak.
---
My first super rara and its on rank 9 yet, while others are 14+.
---
Yeah he’s so good
---
I pull Robo away from the turret. And sometimes enemies into the turret's range. It's fun.
---
Wild West was the most golden of times. I would buy a permanent Wild West theme option ASAP, no questions asked.
---
soon after, ricos and dynamikes start taking over the game
---
Like how you’ll spawn next to an enemy on the sides
---
Can’t believe they just unlocked spike and crow at 2k trophies! Unacceptable 
---
Always go on throwers,never go on tanks
---
EELLLLL PRIIIIIMMMOOOOOOOO!!!!!! Remodel
---
The only problem i see with this map is that it’s too cramped, and so potentially you won’t get a win because of skill but because of where you spawned and the fact that the middle brawler took the jump pad towards you.
---
However I really like the idea behind the map and the artistic mind behind the design!
---
More open areas would be very beneficial
---
It is always like that with Brock. It sucks!!
---
xD
---
Yeah!
---
Oh yeah let me just fire my shotgun— 21 musketeer ammo thingys come out of one musket
---
This I would buy for like 300 gems
---
It was funny is all, your english is fine
---
He needs a mask
---
I personally don’t like it because it seems that there are always 8 people left when the gas is making the map small. But glad you guys like it!
---
You rely in other humans for 3v3, no thanks.
---
Ummm I think he means come up with a new brawler and you know make up some stats?
---
Wow... just wow
---
24 hours is way too long; the only thing Supercell will be finding themselves is that they’re business is dying
---
Indeed sir, indeed.
---
foda-se
---
I'm afraid of misclicking on this button lol
---
U know you can reply right?
---
It’s so cute I want it 
---
no hes still weak 
---
still pretty weak lol
---
This map actually looks decently functional
---
Pretty much I completely agree with the other guy and I think you lost the argument
---
I award you the golden Bomb Petaìre for your contribution :]
