Will the star power work for his super too?? Cause i think doubling the movement speed of the fastest movement in the game is a bit too far...

Since OP most likely won't respond I took my time with a small search to find the Instagram to be private (I think) but the artist's Twitter I found and it is ÈºªÊ∞¥Ëàê„ÇÅÂ§™ÈÉé (@hanamizu_name): https://twitter.com/hanamizu_name?s=09
---
Cactus boy becouse he is a good boy.
---
That's how Brawl Stars works
---
...dood it's not random it's set. Dynamike n barley's hit r always going to be in that shape.
---
Not skill since the spread is random and the game has no skill aside from strafing and long range fights because of brain dead auto aim.
---
 Change my mind; you all know i‚Äôm right.
---
It‚Äôs a ticki torch
---
Since OP never put credits I took my time to find the artist and it is ÈºªÊ∞¥Ëàê„ÇÅÂ§™ÈÉé (@hanamizu_name): https://twitter.com/hanamizu_name?s=09

I couldn't find the Instagram (I think it was private)
---
Changes with movement randomly;
---
The Rng is ‚Äúroughly‚Äù contained in each circle but still random.
---
That would just look to weird and make spike too easy to play
---
Dm me I got 600

*Inserts Thomas and Friends Soundtrack*
---
Yea she's great!
---
And her bouncing effect is kinda op in 3v3
---
I hate going against her with teammates that cant dodge
---
As if there was any in the first place with auto aim and people spamming down choke points until someone has the balls to push.

You thinking this game requires skill is a joke; anyone feel free to challenge me, or downvote and run away.

It's not. It will always go in a shape like that. Each bottle in his super goes from the mid as first, bottom(towards ur character) as second n the top(the furthest from ur character) as the last.
---
Barleys SUPER is random. You can watch Kairos's Range olympics video
---
Actually never thought about that..
---
No. It‚Äôs always random based on movement in similar ‚Äúrough‚Äù locations :)
---
Dood stop trolling. This is a serious discussion n you're being annoying.

Why?

Ok but idk if supercell will even do anything

Why did Leon touch the other lollipop when it‚Äôs already in his mouth? :/

The bot does his best. Because the other meme probably has text inside the post not the title of the post

some of the pic has bad quality and i dont really like the white background.

I thought it was the 200 trophy star player

---
I dont think that's how the entire meme works tbh
---
Wait are they transfering saliva?
---
Dynamikes attack tho.....it looks.........interesting
---
When you hear Emz saying "I am only here for the trophies" in Big Game *confused gamer noises*
---
Dynamikes: *are teaming*
---
Shelly: **FBI OPEN UP**
---
The problem is, crow is a legendary while mortis is a mythic. A mythic is closer to epic.
---
cool art tho keep it up
---
Aiming - autoaim refutes that; the only skill is ‚Äúpredicting‚Äù and getting lucky hit at long range.
---
Dodging - again, luck based and hoping the person won‚Äôt hit you, also refuted by autoaim which is by definition an aimbot.
---
When to attack - ? You‚Äôd have to be braindead to not know a basic fundamental concept; not a skill its a single button you push.
---
When to super - When to use it is obvious depending on the brawler and what it is; everyone autoaims it mostly.
---
Which brawler - Idiotic; you use all brawlers to push them up and increase trophy total.
---
Strategy in each game mode - like what? Teaming up to cheat the game and win (which supercell thinks is ok), or even better, pushing the ike first all at once so it‚Äôs impossible to stop? No one uses strategy, especially not in single queues.
---
Ohh a ticket!
---
Quality Content I love seeing things like this on my feed!

Ah yes, I can imagine what will happen when you press play again with a troll, who is using a Bo, who is equipping Circling Eagle, in Snake Prairie.

Doesn‚Äôt even say powerpoints; not just all brawlers, but all power points and all star powers.

no pls this would give me eyerape
---
bouncing bull would defeat most purposes of using bull's sp in 3v3. some bulls purposely ram into the wall for tactical purposes (eg. stopping the ball) while having less time in his super, when he cannot attack enemies. and tick's one should be regardless of whether he has the super or not.
---
Idk lol, maybe I should add the neck or move the head higher
---
'the map's boundaries' i meant instead of walls
---
What a wimp tho :)
---
I dont think ge searches by 'strategy'...
---
I may be wrong though!
---
Yes
---
Perfection
---
It is not random as you said. However, moving while barley is still launching the bottles will also affect where they land (more obvious with the last 2 bottles), in additional to where he initially aims.

First you need 2 e-mail adresses (1 for your main account and 1 for your second) You connect to supercell id with 1 mail adress and your main account, then you log out of your account and chose play without supercell id, then you play the tutorial, after that you make a new supercell id and connect your second account to that, now when you log out of supercell id you can choose wich mail adress you want therefor wich account you want to play on.

Piper pick, understandably not a good pick in this map. As for Jessie, she's alr? i dont know what the hell you're ranting about.
---
Fortnite bad Minecraft good

And yet you would be complaining if you got matched with someone outside of your trophy range
---
At least it gave some great amount of gold :/

Good idea!

It's the finger pointing that makes it jojo-y... the main character of season 3 always points menancingly like that

Ohh i see i didnt notice it earlier üòÑüòÑ
---
Look think about it don't you think the devs are going to do something about this issue, and in reality they released power play which needs you to have a brawler with a star power right? Well maybe just maybe the next update they will add a coin system or add daily objectives.
---
Me too man me too
---
Such a beautiful moment..
---
It's due to Thiccochet's primitive CPU that convinces him that he'a always playing 3v3. Hence, he will always thank inexistent allies in Lone Star or think he's teaming with others on Takedown. Truly a sign of robotic Schizophrenia

Lol, EMZ, SHEELY, BROCK, TARA, RICO, BULL has 99% similar footprint. How will you distinguish between them? And also by last time you will always come to who is remaining on the map.

And then.. why did you pick penny and poco...?

Now that's what we wanna see.

It doesn't show anything. It is just yolu being a noob and getting shot by a normal shooter bot (the weakest thing in the game)

---
r/titlegore
---
(This comes from a 850+ Jessie trophys perspective) Her main atack is so bad she realoads slow af and do so litle damage, you have to 5-6 shot a brawler with the same range as her while them can kill you in 3 or less, not to mention how freacking slow is her shot speed and how it's the easiest thing to dodge even, most of the time people can just come right up to you while taking shots to the chest and still kill her with no problem, she is only good when the team have controll, but 9/10 times you're not getting control with her.
---
About the turret: it's great the only problem is it's shot speed, even at 4 or more tiles people can just go left or right and dodge literally 100% of the shots bruh it's so ridicoulus the amount of time i place a turret with low health dodge like it isn't even there.
---
And last about the "Crying baby are expecting every brawler to be", Supercell buffed the SHIT out of many brawlers in the game in the year while not buffing jessie a single time, if everyone can be buffed why jessie can't ? Does it seem fair to you to have to out play every single brawler in the game while the same have all advantages against you ?, Because i don't think it is ...
---
Well, I wanted to get 5 min in Big Brawler Fight. I had originally intended to do that to Jessie, but when I had the idea, my Jessie was already rank 6, so I went through some calculations, and chose Rico. Because I thought Rico's star power would be really easy to recognize. I had the idea before the 2nd star power update, so you can see why I chose Rico.
---
Yes it‚Äôs a great idea, as most of the star powers depends on the map
---
Uhhh, wait, how is your spike at level 9 but has starpower? Isn't it supposed to be level 10?
---
I'd like to see you make a map that isn't mildly shit.

---

---
*gets downvoted into oblivion* 
---
(All Seriousness, think it‚Äôs possible to add some kind of way to hit multiple brawlers without making her busted? I‚Äôm just curious on that and feel she is actually fine-ish now)
---
Leon-when arranged correctly,he can hit multiple enemies.
---
8-Bit-if target is low hp and there is a target directly behind it,8 bit can hit more than one target.
---
Colt-same as 8 bit.
---
Rico-same as 8 bit.
---
Crow-same as leon
---
Keep in mind,attack and projectile are two different things.If we were talking about projectiles,many brawlers would NOT be able to hit multiple enemies because you only consider 1 projectile,whereas an attack is 1 bar,which is a series of projectiles.
---
Just...no
---
Bye bye life leech

Yes, the artist putted up a lot of effort deserves upvotes, though it have a low chance of getting implemented on the game but still its way better than those low effort chocky milk... üòÄüòÄ

#HAMMER DOWN!

I honostly dont see any point in this? 99% of the time u have a better star power for the map. Since u cant change maps and mods its highly unlikly u are going to want to change the SP. Only if u made a mistake and chose a bad one but had good randoms i guess? But still there are more important things to bs added then this, that is nothing more then a niche

---
Yeah people say some games are dead, but they still come back to it one day. "Oh clash Royale is dead" the next thing you know they download it the next update rolls out. The problem with Fortnite is that it gets repetitive. Ive never played it but many of my friends quit because they said its repetitive, because of the weekly updates. You can't keep a Battle Royale alive for long. Minecraft on the other side is a survival game and it has creative mode. There will be always new quests to go to and new places to discover. In battle Royales the biggest update they could do is a change of the map and new weapons, gamemodes. It will get repetitive. In a game like Minecraft, you could literally add anything.

---
Ah yes, a true celeste fan
---

---

It isn't Sonic Mania, but is also the ost of the game "Celeste", i don't remember the name but if you search "Celeste chapter 3 - b side ost" surely It will appear

Thats Puuki. He's well known in gernany for being a clickbaiterü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
f rank is op cuz if our turret is 40 and theirs 80 then he will only have 700 damage and is tankiest. i didnt  understood pipers though. All r amazing though. Keep it up love them all.

This guy is 200iq. You get the skin you get the brawler

---
Sandy is insomniac confirmed
---
It's really amazing!
---
Wherr
---
They dont give credits. The credits must be in the picture, but still
---
Cringe
---
It's because there jokes are sarcasm and making fun or people who bully others for playing other games. You probably like minecraft right? Well the same people thst get bullied now for playing fortnite got bullied for playing minecraft a few years ago, that's why some people make fun of the toxic bullies.
---
Wow thats too high..... I pulled my 1st lege at 0.2114%
---
You got plenty of gems tho, are legendaries THAT expensive?
---
Is it bad that i didnt know Nita's bear is called Bruce?

---
I love Minecraft. I have been playing it for 9 years. In 2013-2015 I was bullied for playing Minecraft. They called me a nerd because I always created redstone contraptions. But now it's my time to destroy the motherfuckers who bullied me.
---
15 now hahaha get rekt nub xd get haxxed ^/s
---
I was a noob around these times didn‚Äôt know a lot about this game till my friend told me about during global.Ive been playing all since now I‚Äôm at 14k trophies
---
The brawl ball funny moments are just sad to the other team
---
Wow, look at that, one bonus item
---
or watch pewdiepie and dont worry about opening boxes
---
My crush told me he only liked asians, but didn‚Äôt know I was born in Asia.
---
In my opinion the edits are annoying. It's hurting my head because the screen is spinning or moving every fucking second.
---
That reminds me i still havent karmawhored the shit out of my cale day
---

I,too wanted to change my supercell ID Gmail...guess I'm happy with what I got..thx(‡πë‚Ä¢Ôπè‚Ä¢)
---
When you try your best..
---
Sorry, no offence, it just popped up
---
I bet you to get Nita -_-
---
It‚Äôs a good idea but no brawlers in that road
---
Sure go for it. Please link the video to me I'm curious now.
---
it would be a rapunzel skin then
---
It was 4 tickets
---
Sorry dude that‚Äôs old üòê
---
Made with memeatic
---
Dang that‚Äôs feels bad.(I‚Äôm going to press f on my keyboard right now)
---
This dude has already got his star points even though season didn't ended yet
---
That‚Äôs quite unlucky then, although if you have all the other brawlers it‚Äôs probably average as they lower your legendary chances
---
U meen like you *
---
Noice üòÇ‚ù§Ô∏èüëç
---
1. Only the sizze is bigger, not the box of it
---
2. Youtubers only use it because it's the most expensive skin for Rico. I mean have you seen any big BS Youtuber use no-skin brawlers?
---
Legend says that it's as long as her range...
---
Good one ;D
---
You can play Leon before the October update. Nice.
---
I played against Brawl Power ;D
---
Nope, they are just using the skin because they bought it and it's the most expensive and the best looking Rico skin. They be flexin'
---
Omg so sad...
---
Both takedown and lone star suck. For takedown:
---
1. The other players always kill the other players instead of the bot and it gives them a disadvantage. 
---
2. Takedown is basically having to try and avoid 9 other opponents while trying to do damage and at least even make it NEAR the boss. 
---
Lone star:
---
1. Other players may also be at a disadvantage because of their spawn area or timing.
---
2. Lone star is just solo bounty. And he fact that there are 9 other players to kill and avoid, it makes it harder for some players especially if the opponents power level is higher. 
---
Just my opinion. :/  Supercell needs to fix this.
---
Song name?
---
I pyed with him in brawl ball
---
Played *
---
Poco 4 the win
---
Honestly looks like a pokemon
---
Just got him 1st November
---
XD that's great
---
Psssttt
---
OK you're right. I though big boxes have to contain at least powerpoints for 2 brawlers
---
He is a bastion player, dont care if he lose
---
Did you mean to have that audio in.
---
B-rock
---
But how do you get inside?
---
Me too.it is sad.i still dont have a legendary.
---
Who‚Äôs plays Forknita
---
AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH take all my money just dont hurt me
---
üòÇ I was playing with mortis

Just how
---
Its not a new brawl talk, is a reference to the FIRST BRAWL TALK on the official channel
---
Barley was so much fun on this map
---
use the hat
---
I love guys with big ducks
---
"We need a dispenser right here"
---
Cool
---
In what way? I kinda like it
---
This whole sub is shit
---
This game wasn‚Äôt introducing really anything new. Hope Supercell find another gem soon.
---
I think people dont see anything girl about her at first glance, like usually girls don't have that kind of haircut.
---
Naming yourself the brawler whose icon you're using
---
Lol u nibba
---
Didn't they nerf that?
---
Idk
---
Wow rico power its rareüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Aww! Too bad.
---
Can somebody explain how brawl stars is a battle royal game?
---
They do look bigger. Even if they have the same hitbox, it would certainly throw me off. A similar thing is with dragon knight Jessie. I can never dodge her attack.
---
Yeah
---
I hate that I can only use my heavy short range brawlers because they‚Äôre the ones that I maxed out on power play
---
WEBTOON strip BLUECHAIR
---
This is gone?
---
penny should be in "that could work" also colt is good if he gets matched with pam and 8bit
---
thats funny tho
---
Ok ngl this skin looks sick for how simplistic it is
---
What do you use for these drawings apps websites can u tell also 
---
As tummorow is December I wanna see bit more breast
---
I recommend playing showdown, its the best way to earn trophies. Also, download brawl stats to see the best brawlers for each map.
---
But the hat looks ugly.
---
I think no hat is 100 times cooler.
---
But.. Christmas skins are exclusive, I guess?
---
Sombooooooody Ight I'm a take a nap
---
bounty is the most fun game mode without any doubt
---
He could have spent nothing to little on that account. 
---
Get over it. It‚Äôs banned.

Which... is roughly $600AUD, or $400USD. Big yikes from me. Thank you for what you have done for Supercell.

At least he didn't use Mortis
---
That's just lucky lol. I didn't have any until 8k and now I'm at 8.7k with three legendaries and two star powers
---
I've seen on twitter some of them assuming this, although they made it clear that it's not really a projectile size advantage, it makes it easy to control because it confuses when it comes to shunting projectiles
