Yeah. I wouldn‚Äôt expect someone at 5k to have more than 1 legendary unless they bought them.

i have crow and leon both pulled before 5k, haven‚Äôt spent a dime on the game
---
_PornHubs enough to reforestate_
---
I got all 3 legendaries by 5000 but it‚Äôs been a good 300 boxes since my last brawler and I still don‚Äôt have Tara.
---
that's really cute
---
but they look oily :P
---
I honestly feel like Penny is a short adult. She doesn't really sound like a kid
---
When you see a bull walk into a bush and a colt walks up to it
---
I got crow and spike in back to back small boxes at around 1800 trophies. Got annoyed because I wasn‚Äôt getting any new brawlers so I eventually just caved and spent $20 to get Leon.

Hey everyone, if every brawler was in a hunger games like scenario and has overwatch like attacks, what power would they have?And what do you think the battles would look like?
---
Example:Barley breaking his bottles and lighting them up while mortis charges at him.

Tara! Look at what you‚Äôve done. Now the animators are gonna have to draw all this fire!
---
He will never be a joke
---
Haha actually, I was the first BrawlTuber to do this on a video WAAAAY back when Big Game was released as Boss Fight. On top of that, some of my "Random Brawlers" videos are some of my most popular.
---
With all that said, I'll definitely echo a lot of what other people have said regarding the lack of content Supercell has been releasing with Brawl Stars. I still have a lot of original ideas to put out on YouTube, but the trick is releasing them when the views will be highest. Because of the lack of update content, views are at a big low right now, so I'm holding back.
---
Either way, I saw you said I was your favorite! Your support means a lot! Especially during these slow times! üëç
---
I was level one too
---
Why in the fuck 
---
Why did chara's hair is pink?
---
That feeling just feels so good
---
Yeah but level ones don‚Äôt do much damage so that‚Äôs why they couldn‚Äôt kill you in time
---
i agree on the unneeded buff thing tho, he should get it reversed tbh
---
But great vid anyways
---
But I was level one so I had less health so I almost died in time
---
Thanks kairos i can't believe you actually comment on my meme üòÅ
---
jeb leon
---
Honestly most jump pads are a terrible idea to use unless you KNOW nobody is on the other side
---
Lmao
---
Pretty low form what I can see but also depends on the number of boxes you are gonna. Open
---
This is some quality content
---
Lets get this to hot because yes
---
and the overall trophies should be taken in mind tbh, once i got an actual 13k player on my team
---
we lost in seconds
---
Probably built in Apple one
---
Even if you were level ten and they were level ten then they would‚Äôve killed you much faster and you wouldn‚Äôt have been able to make the goal in time but GREAT CLIP MATE
---
It shoulda been Thomas the train
---
meme failed
---
I think that bibi is trying to help that nita get her trophies up
---
FBI OPEN UP
---
But if they dealt more damage and I had more health, wouldn't it be the same outcome but THANKS MATE.
---
The biggest issue is that coming out with a super creative video right now means it'll get super low views because it's been so long since Brawl Stars gas released new content (Brawl isn't trending right now so my vids won't either).
---
So at the moment I'm using a "maintenance strategy" to minimalise the negative impact. Once there's more Brawl Stars hype on YouTube, I'll switch back to a "growth strategy" by releasing the unique content I've been saving for later.
---
You're right. It's my job. But beyond being creative I also have to be a master of my channel analytics and YouTube's algorithm.
---
This is mine u have copied literally everything
---
Thanks for your support! üí™
---
This man could fuck us all
---
Damn this is a really well made map that looks really fun, but i would move the safe walls cus carl exists
---
No they would‚Äôve killed you faster we‚Äôll you keep messaging I have stuff do do have a great day
---
Uh okay?
---
This is so dope i saving it right now
---
:D
---
That's fucking abuse
---
Star power let's his main attack break walls.
---
I don‚Äôt see Jessie, I see ash rushing my ass into the objective
---
Just like for any other game match there are different Maps players get to choose their 3 Brawlers based on the map. If your on a map where a shotgunner is going to do poorly against a sniper and you use the shotgunner anyways well then that's your own damn fault isn't it.
---
Yeah, but overtime is empty and Mortis isn't good in a giant open space.

---
If we put meteror mod in this then its gud for long range ...
---
And there r a lot of boxes i think every brawler got minimum 7 cubes in the starting from boxes
---
Just stop playing for tonight (if it is night for you) and wait for tomorrow. Don't want to lose *too* many trophies.
---
Still hoping for hijab tara

Seriously, make more. Parks and Recreation and The Officr have a LOT of great gags like this that can be used to great effect

King crimson next brawler

It will stay the same its been lagging hard

Anyway  want to play some bs

Lol my gene only went from 340 to 298 or something lol

If you show the credit for the idea  I will tell you skinssss
---
Don't waste your time on Leon skin try to make Brock skin confirm supercell add your skin
---
Im fairly good at mortis im going to give you some tips and tricks to be good at mortis.  
---
Stay away from the following brawlers  
---
\-Bibi  
---
\-Rosa  
---
\-El Primo  
---
\-Spike (unless he just used all his shots then you can rekt him)  
---
Your main attack reloads very slowly you need to pick of kills or chain attacks with his super.   
---
Its assumed youll not play alot of showdown so you need team mates to provide backup in the form of long rnage damage your going to be a front liner and stealer in most things.  
---
Use your attack aim it and run away if things start looking even a little bad because once mortis is low on health hes not hard to take out.

I am sure, his bibi was high and he had the same zodiac sign emoji.

Best super brawler - Tara

Best star power - Penny's of course

This better be thomas the train or iam disliking this
---
Says the teamer accusing others of teaming
---
Not everyone would get this. I have read that book so many times!!
---
Bibi, Mortis, Darryl. These star powers all allow the respective brawlers to fulfill their roles a lot easier i.e. Darryl and Mortis are much better assassins with their star powers, and Bibi needs the speed boost to catch up to the faster brawlers.
---
I like how Leon is one of the ppl holding hands w/ Jessie
---
VC? playing with randoms is gonna involve a whole lot of me screaming at them
---
fastest way to push trophy is hiest. That's why I made this map.
---
Maybe it's too much.
---
I do however think that the brawlers mentioned need buffs.
---
laughs in TF2
---
Lmao, maybe he's losing for purpose to push other pro friend's trophies much easier lol. Why he's just using bb instead of showdown?

yeah that‚Äôs pretty common

This looks absolutely amazing! I wonder what would happen if pipis and morper met.
---
From a loser to a god
---
Umn no , spend few bucks in the game.
---
I got mortis at 6.5k and still don‚Äôt have gene or Tara and legendaries at 8K
---
its funny
---
He/She has started 13 days ago.
---
What
---
I see that you are a person of culture.
---
Thats just not true
---
Oh. Good job.. I also reached 1.7k in 9 days so it can be done if you just spend a lot of time
---
What did it cost?
---
Lego roblox
---
Yeah but I saw the same meme on Another subreddit, and I didn't want to be called a reposter
---
Ya don‚Äôt say?
---
Ummm sorry there was a mistake in the last one so I did this again....
---
4 types of randoms in bb:
---
1) Bot- runs at the ball spans auto aim at start 
---
2) Normal- Endangered species, known to play the game properly while trying their best
---
3) Random- scores in own goal
---
4) Hog- Ball hogs the ball the entire match and never passes
---
That's one of the reasons why I like the mode cause even if you're getting trashed first two rounds you can still win

Yes Bibi is the meta right now every time I play Showdown the Bibi I meet always have at least 7 power ups and her damage is insane
---
I had to delete the previous post because of the image quality sorry

Right above a smartphone store. Lol.
---
Meeee
---
I am a good random
---
Then send it to ur phone/computer from ur iPad mate
---
Why not Pipis
---
That was mean
---
It gives a chance to the other team but takes the chance away from the team that has control because even though in the third round you still have control, you will definitely lose in the last
---
 its a russian tag for timming
---
Edited the "s" off, happy now?
---
Well u heard what ash and kairos said:best brawler in meta and needs nerf.i actually have bibi and she is really good especially in 3v3
---
Even you are a random
---
I don't think so! For me randoms are very good at 300 and above throphies. Yeah, sometimes randoms are randoms ;-; but I often find very good teammates who play on my level and show very well their skill in this game. But bellow 300, well... not gonna lie, randoms mostly suck there (even with high level brawlers), so I mostly play showdown with new bralwers, get them to 300 and then, the real fun begins on 3vs3s ;P
---
got killed by a dynamike the dynamike got killed by Mortis

The Real Question is that why you took these pictures
---
Lucky you will be able to see it IRL though.
---
Very cool
---
Now I am starting that 200 trophies is a bit too much maybe 100 is enough
---
Same. I tilted my creature of the night so bad (from 380 to 280). I would recommend playing excel instead of gem grab.
---
Yep. In the patch notes there are asterisks that lead to the bottom and it says that any of these patches that are starred dont apply in friendlies, another one of these patches that dont apply to friendlies are the bibi close range missing fix among others.
---
Ekhem, look on Meta Brawlers tier list... Poco, Piper and Mike sucks there, but Primo have a pretty high spot, just learn how to play him (I often call some brawlers that I can't play worst, but it's natural cuz u are angry at them, like ai was on Carl on first and Bibi, but now I feel pretty dang good about them :P)
---
the scroll of *Truth* only speaks the *truth*

tip number 1: have good teammates to play with

tip number 2: be good yourself
---
tip number 3: play some games
---
tip number 4: profit

Try to play solo SD. This shows you if issue with your teammates or you. If it's your issue - don't panic. Just play and try to improve yourself. I also watch BrawlTV sometimes to see how top players play.

well, that shows the person do not has a stroke because mortis really do not need an buff

Its still weird that they put small children in a hunger games styled arena. In the hunger games they where teens. Here they are children under the age of 10. Its a childrens game got damnit. Supercell is kinda twisted now when you think about it deeply...

Seriously though what kind of shitposting is this. Literally 5 trophies different. This is **almost perfect** matchmaking and yet you are complaining for some reason?

But you are probably referring to the power level which is not and should never be factored into matchmaking.

It doesn‚Äôt help. Your odds are no different whether you open them as you get them or save them. Unless you‚Äôre fully maxed(or have all the brawlers and a new one is coming out), there‚Äôs really no point in saving.

Why the hell would you have max brawlers at 240 trophies?

Lvl1 brawlers can easily be pushed to 340

It looks like theres gonna be a slot for a third box

Could you have cropped it a bit better? Other than that it‚Äôs pretty good

Really..? I'm sorry, I can't remember how much gems was it.. still, not many people have it. Maybe because darryl kinda sucks if you dont have its star power

---

---
OK that's cool
---
dASHoT
---
dhaa, we can not make carls skin with every vehicle
---
Why did you write the text, just type it.
---
This is what happens when you get too impatient
---
Me: sees a nice meme
---
Mematic: you fool! You fell victim to one of the classic blunders!
---
Omg that's my next vacation
---
Bo after jojo,s
---
No! :,v
---
It still looks like Bibi has boobs tho
---
Sry im toxic sometimes üåöüë¥üèøü•ñ ive played since beta day 1
---
Every single video is like this. Just over 10 minutes, some silhouette with a question mark, red arrows and circles, it's all just bullshit.
---
No, it's fine, don't worry. I'm a global player, but I watched some gameplay during Beta. I do remember when Piper was OP.
---
I didn't even realize! Dang üòÇ
---
[removed]
---
3.57 tiles dash? The epic rarity one? The third one drawn up on the left of my post? This was OP my first epic btw now he is mythic tho, he was wrecking primo wtf I did not get ez trophies without playing him
---
No, my day was a **** match make with the name Dyna and mortis Wich where teaming with each.
---
Should I post this on mildy infuriating then? üòÇ
---
Looking at actual Mortis motivates me to want lose my virginity
---
PP up
---
why is there spike???
---
lol iphone store under it
---
Huh?
---
*Nani?!*
---
I am president of mine and it is 61st in U.S.
---
I feel like Mortis is much better on this map. Any thrower will be able to feed off bull or push the bull back
---
*RIP SPINNERS*
---
This isint real life its a game üòÇ in this game all tanks are faster.
---
I honestly prefer the one from back then over the current one
---
This makes me to chew 5gum.
---
Ik how to do it it is not hard
---
How did you gain almost 9k trophies in 6 months üò±
---
Me too because I am now watching jojo
---
It can but It can‚Äôt suddenly increase 0.2
---
Rockabillity mortis?
---
Imagine if the crow was named rosa
---
Mega*
---
Why is Shelly with Poco... replace that Shelly with top hat Mortis and this tier list makes sense
---
Why is this a spoiler?
---
I always assumed BiBi was like 2B from NieR. Small but really strong melee fighter? `Check.` but a biker not some loli robot
---
What the frick dude.
---
You're saying their bad? But what if we were just so good :P. Your right though, they had pretty bad skill but still was neat how they didn't hold any gems except for that one time the Shelly got one
---
The only time they were good were when leon was released in december
---
Outstanding move
---
Yeah, but you have to play 2 games to get both üòÇ
---
Good job.
---
Brock: Right in the hea- *then gets smacced by mortis's shovel*
---
Oh cool!
---
Get good then
---
That's honestly annoying; please don't ruin other people's experiences
---
ü§î
---
Let me speak for supercell.
---
No.
---
:¬¥(
---
They lost twice yikes
---
Next up on LWAIY:
---
4k trophies in BS is like 1000-1500 in CR They are not camparable at all, there is 16 legendary cards, and only 3 legendary brawlers in BS. Getting a legendary in CR is easy, but hard in BS, but maxing out a legendary is way harder in CR than BS (wich is easy as the rest of the brawlers). Different mechanics upgrade mechanics that we can't compare.  And as a android beta player with almost 10k trophies, getting Crow (first and only legendary brawlers even with 300$ of gemming) made me so fucking happy, instead of getting a legendary wich is pretty meh to get (I got every card in clash royale without paying for anything else than emotes.
---
Brock: i was lag- ah eh ah oh god *losing blood*
---
lol I have same Samsung tablet :D
---
It's 2019 YouTube, isn't it?
---
They don't want gems to be easy to get. They want you to buy the gemsü§ë
---
Meanwhile CoC is a beautifully crafted Lamborghini driving in pure style with its hero skin passengers further along on the road, out of the photo.
---
Oh god, and it's OG Bull
---
Yeah I know. üçæü§ëüëåüìàüìàüìàüìàüìàüéâüéâüóúüóøüëå
---
Your genius... It's almost frightening!
---
I've packed spike out of a free box in the shop... (It is my first legendary and then I was at 4400 trophies)
---
Do you are have stupid
---
Meme üëè correction üëè there is only one Mortis chasing the food I ask for a correction of the last part
---
I think you mean Bareyl.
---
fortnite competitive is a joke too but true
---
Not night b*tch
---
*gets naked*
---
Can‚Äôt believe he *new* they were his eyes
---
Hope, I get my 480 like meme in coach cory‚Äôs next meme review
---
This looks amazing!
---
Crow next please!
---
That I will do right now!
---
R
---
Wow my mortar never hits an enemy but enemy's always hit me or my teammates
---
*WHAT*
---
#*WHAT THE FUCK*
---
Better than me tho...
---
Rosa shouldn‚Äôt be s tier anymore.
---
A gene did that to me when he saved me from a bull in SD before we part ways as the last brawlers in the match he wanted me to win... What a good man
---
F2P is the source of all evil.
---
This allways happens to me when i am lagging at the first moments of the match.
---
Good job just a little less bushes that way close rang and sharpshooters could have a chance
---
Drawing isn‚Äôt bad it‚Äôs the quality
---
Epic am I right?
---
Brawl boxes. There isn‚Äôt really any other but paying. Lol.
---
THE WAY YOU KEEP ME GUESSING
---
It should be Rosa, Primo or Jessie for the first 2. Then you'll have encapsulated all of the noob brawlers. Leon and Colt take some level of skill in comparison.
---
How did you make this?
---
Should I spend gems from the boxes on the token doublers? I‚Äôm doing everything in my will to stay F2P lol
---
Idk
---
Thats so cute
---
I am at 4750 trophys and i have every brawler except for carl, Bibi and gene. Playing since Christmas
---
That scout is a spy
---
Even worse, siege makes me want to kill myself
---
I‚Äôm about to end this man‚Äôs whole career
---
Sure buddy!
---

---
F For Crow

---
Why not a picture of some barley for barley? Js
---
*Hiss*
---
I made a new template too but i cant post photos, why! :'&lt;
---
The Gene is just waiting to pull the brawler when he is low health to get all the power cubes
---
More!
---
You forgot Donald trump
---
Many days i didn't see your art again?
---

---
Change the format of the image  (JPEG, PNG...)
---
Everything on the hot is all poco related, just how I like it
---

---
Mortis would still win this happened to me
---
Gotta wait a day
---

---
I swapped my alt to North Korea
---

---
Why is there a watermark if you know people are going to use it
---
F to pay "recpect" and F _tier_
---
Credits :v
---
I feel like it's fake... but if it is real... Nice job
---
Thank you! This is a much older art style I have that was kinda inspired by a favorite comic series.
---
ok
---
It is a cute and simple name. A lot shorter than Athena that is for sure.
---
That counts as teaming
---
It's okay if you don't believe it. It is true though!
---
&gt;all of them have their star power on siege 
---
Now this is cursed
---
Bob also has a nice hat.
---
Wow,  *P E N N Y S U P E R I N T E N S I F I E S*
---
ok, then Great job!
---
I agree
---

---
‚ÄúI talked about it two days ago and there is the Brawl Talk probably‚Äù
---
But people will assume it's a (re)(post)
---
Great super on that crow bro
---
High quality post
---
It will make up for losing like 3000 trophies
---
Seems accurate (thanks for the link to my favorite song)
---
High quality comment :)
