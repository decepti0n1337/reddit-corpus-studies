Dont play with randoms, especially in a mode with double trophies. Play it with friends with a good comp, or lose trophies with randoms jumping in springtraps and suiciding all game

Except that this isn't a sudden problem. This has always been a problem and is surprisingly more prevalent as you climb in trophies. How can players possibly be getting worse as you climb in trophies? That makes no logical sense. And you can tell if they know what they're doing or not. You can tell when players use brawlers that are ill suited to the map or mode that they don't know what they're doing. Or when they use brawlers that are ill suited to specific roles. Seasoned players know that, in gem grab for instance (generally speaking) you have a Gem Carrier, an Aggro and a Support. That the Gem Carrier takes center lane, aggro takes left and support takes right. That control is integral to winning, not killing opponents, that aggro brawlers don't carry gems cause it's too high risk and to protect your gem carrier. They know not to fall back until you have at least 2 more gems than you opponents and so on.
---
If you pay attention you can tell which players know what's up, and which ones don't. It's not difficult.

At first, it not a bug, it a feature. Secondly, there are more strategy like Clash Royale.  Do you overwhelmed them with robot or chip away the safe.  Tank and high damage is dominated the game right now so have this option is better for the game.

I agree, like when your teammate passes you the ball when you next to the goal and the enemy is about spawn, or when you have a good team comp with randoms and one of them only pick up. I know it isn't a sudden problem for randoms at updates, but i just mentioned it since was losing many trophies after the update just released, seeing many bulls and el primo is showdown
---
Teaming is for cowards. Plain and simple. Can't hack it? Team. Really should be their motto.

Finally upvite worthy comment/s
---
Exactly. But if you do not team you will just end up losing trophies over trophies. Sadly that's the game, we can't really do anything about it, neither can the developers.
---
I feel although this is an obvious solution, perhaps there should be a clear signal, like a red arrow pointing at your IKE...
---
It‚Äôs way too easy to just sneak and go unnoticed, especially when your keeping the enemies busy on the frontlines.
---
One buff to the IKE could be increasing it‚Äôs radius by 1 tile, or perhaps making the radius more oval-shaped at the sides, to prevent a sneaky turret getting through m.

Would you rather be an ugly legendary or a ultra sexy CREATURE OF THE NIGHT

Thats a bug, the "0" is to much there cuz my friend has the aame thing but its only 299 gems

That's incredibly nieve. Yes they can. They just haven't yet. 
---
They said when the subject was first broached that they were fine with teaming as long as it's not the only way to win. 
---
Now you're saying its the only way to win. So you just prove that the worst of all possible scenarios has occurred and that teamers have actually, officially ruined Showdown. Thank you.

Don‚Äôt get your hopes up. While convenient to some, it would also make the game less social. I think they want to keep the small social interactions there currently is!
---
Exactly what i wanted to see üëå
---
This won't work. Trophies are not just rewards, it's also the game's Elo mechanic for keeping similar levels of skill playing together. If it got easier to earn trophies, skill levels would be all over the place and the game would likely get LESS competitive. What I'd really like to see is a separation of the Elo and Rewards. Just my 2 cents.

excuse me????? what the fujk did you just said?

Star power:Normal attacks,when hit the walls it divides doing 50% of the damage,in super after it get at max range it divides making a medium rain of crystal making 300 per second
---
I got Crow the same way
---
&amp;#x200B;

The idea is pretty good except for the super. You're kind of relying on the other team to have a jessie, pam, or penny to reach it's full potential 
---
Works for me 
---
Thanks! Same. I saw someone mention this in a comment and thought "I can do that!" I'm surprised I haven't seen it; I don't know if anyone else has drawn a concept like this yet.

I have the worst luck in the world I guess
---
I'm with you

Yeah I was kinda just thinking it would do a fair amount of damage to still be useful, then the turret thing would just be an added bonus

I would probably add more spring pads. The map is good, but there are too many choke points where only star dynamike could get away.

I srsly dont understand. It looks perfectly normal to me. He has 4 boxes and 99 tokens. Not sure what u mean by lit up.

Never underestimate the stupidity of El primo.

Well, yes, but actually, no

JK, i was thinking of a shield you deploy as a turret (in the same way you throw them). it covers an area of 4x4 tiles (altough it could be 5). Everyone that is inside the shield is immune to splash and penetration attacks too, but can not shot from the inside. Enemies can go inside it too, so its pretty balanced (good for sharpshooters, bad for tanks). The shield lasts (maybe, i have to think about it better) 12 seconds.
---
I just think there should be more team based characters (like Pam) who can actually help their team and encourage **actual** teamwork.

I'll take two.  Do you gift wrap?

Why would they change a character‚Äôs functions for a SKIN? Slippery, bump.... BUMPY? It rolls that‚Äôs the whole character.

&gt;all you have to do is unlock that brawler 
---
Aren't there soft-launch players that are yet to get a legendary? Even mythics...
---
&gt;In royale it would be like having to get a legendary like 30 times which is insane
---
Hmm  I feel legendaries are easier to get there, Also you can buy them from the shop for gold after 3000 cups , and you can trade them,  btw a level 12 legendary is good enough for ladder
---
It's not just you, the person who posted this earlier today feels the same way

How many throphies do you have?

Y‚Äôall are forgetting about trap spike. Trap spike, now trans Mortis. 
---
I understand that, but still. Having it as a Friendly Battle exclusive mode would've been applicable, no?
---
I honestly wish they were more expensive? (More rare)
---
Oh yeah I'd buy this. Reminds me of the Birdio skin from League of Legends
---
Only 90‚Äôs kids remember
---
True and in both games it‚Äôs all luck and it is true you can‚Äôt use gold yet but they‚Äôve said they‚Äôre working on it. Yeah some don‚Äôt have legendaries but statistically they have to open 1000 boxes to get one but even if they don‚Äôt they for sure maxed their other brawlers
---
Well done!  As I said on the contest I passed on MANY maps to the devs and yours worked out great!
---
Dont worry too much, you will end up getting some brawlers soon, just like i did (Mortis and Spike). Keep on mind that the chances accumulate and get higher for everytime you dont unlock anything. It took me like a month to get anything again after getting Leon, but it was worth it. Also, Carl is a Super Rare, so if you get him your chances wont lower that much.

Yeah I agree. I personally believe Supercell didn't do a great job on those two. When I was starting out I thought they were the same brawler. Although the game standards and mine are different, this is just my personal guide and standards for the brawlers of the game.

True that. It takes a while to really settle into a meta. We can't expect in to happen in 2 days. That's fair. I'll give you that one.

u can also use it 2 pick up the ball when the other team doesnt expect it, if they try and corner it or kick it back u can sneak up and steal it

This isn't new info though

Penny‚Äôs splash attack is very strong and her turret is op when it‚Äôs behind walls and the enemy team doesn‚Äôt have a way to deal with it.
---
Im not artistic either, im autistic
---
If I got them, why I should waiting for an offer to buy one? I didn't want to make you salty bro, relax
---
I'd prefer if it came faster as opposed to larger possible amount 
---
Any proofs that you have 7.2 trophies?
---
What do you mean?
---
Splash attack is pretty easy to avoid, and her turret can be countered by waking in a line
---
Or a pistol
---
You bought that Rico skin to flex with the gems you refunded. Probably bought popcorn thicco too you sly bastard xD
---
holy shit, this is Amazing!!! 
---
Yeah I wanted to put the stuff below the TL dr up on top but I was lazy ( I actually don‚Äôt know how it works)
---
Yeah but u also need a useful team too, which is rare af
---
With Brock I could only go, shoot once to the IKE with the rocket's area damage edge and go back with less than 1000 HP left, IKE's damage per shot, so I don't think Piper woild be able to to this. The one it can without being detected is Penny's mortar.
---
I honestly don‚Äôt respect Leon players cause he honestly is a low skill cap brawler with the ability to go invisible
---
Big fan of this!
---
- As a crow player
---
She has more damage, arguably better accuracy since her shot is a bag that does more damage than 2/3 of crows darts (plus additional coins), just learn how to aim. 
---
Speed is a plus (making up for his low HP, getting two shot by almost everything), but his high reload is only cause of his low damage. Stronger passive? The passive is what makes him unique and a legendary can‚Äôt really call that ‚Äústronger‚Äù. Either way, it‚Äôs situational. If you want to do more damage (and more damage to multiple opponents, penny is the *obvious* choice), while Crow‚Äôs poisons people who can just run and wait the poison out then outdamage you, hell, shelly at range could clap a Crow.
---
Crow‚Äôs super takes forever to get just for it to have a delay on it. That being said, it‚Äôs a glorified piper super but instead of bombs it‚Äôs darts from start to end. It‚Äôs good up until you realize you super‚Äôd near another enemy and end up dying anyways.
---
All penny has is her hp? Yeah cause aoe attacks after hit and an aoe canon with range greater than Brocks isn‚Äôt anythig going for her at all.
---
Seeing as you play Leon you‚Äôre probably not great against Crows as a matchup bud, keep practicing you‚Äôll get better.
---
Good luck I hope you get it sorted out. I have a friend who owes like 5k gems in clash royale because he had his little brother buy gems without him knowing. 
---
0s, 6s, 12s, 18s and **a 407**. Perfect, no?
---
he cant talk because he has no teeth
---
No, this is meant as a joke.
---
Nita, Bull, Darryl, and even Colt have methods of dishing out DPS using their supers on the enemy base. 
---
Eww that was sick
---
Nope, max 22 level
---
Yeah i have opend a ton of brawl boxes and mega boxes and only gold so far... havent gotten any star power for a rly long time...
---
Does anyone else feel like they are getting a lot less gems (I'm f2p and those 3 gems from boxes matter to me). Since the last 4 days, after spending all of my gems, I've gotten literally 3 gems and I never missed a box ( wasted a token). In fact I even have token doublers. Stuck with only 3 gems since the last 4 days.
---
P.S. : I'm not complaining. Just asking of this is the case with you guys too.
---
To PrEtTy FoR pAiN
---
I believe they deducted the non discounted value of gems, mega boxes, and gold you got in the pack. 
---
upgraded to lvl 9? if not then focus on upgrading.  you will get them eventually. 
---
F for primo 
---
who else remembers watching that show?
---
We ShAlL mEeT aGaIn! 
---
Than*
---
Yeah! Now from any box i open i only get gold. So im jus saving gold to push them to level 9. So my past at least 50 boxes have been nothing but gold...
---
Right but too idealistic, the teamers have adapted now. They won‚Äôt let you get up close and personal (unless they know they can burst you down in .2 sec if anything happens). Throwers especially know to keep their distance
---
Eh, it could be worse!! 
---
Karen told him on Pinterest. 
---
Its fair game..... just like how colt can attack the enemy turret with his super woithout getting in range of the turret and like how brock can damage the enemy turret without getting hurt if you are careful enough.
---
The penny tactic is just for cheap damage and is completely fair. After all, all you need to do is just walk up to it and destroy it. And at my trophy range i loae 12 trophies and gain 10 so stop whining about petty things like this. The penny turret is easy to deal with. Its you who sucks
---
That's a cool idea either!
---
It's okay, you're probably gonna be one of those guys who get three legendaries at once in a mega box
---
Unless you're mopping the floor with the enemy, it's too risky. 
---
Maybe but it's weird since everyone that I know got an offer :/
---
It‚Äôs fake

Since you where the only person to even guess, the trophies match the damage per bullet
---
Bro the thing is I‚Äôm not even saying that they implemented it directly as a connection to Sakura I‚Äôm saying that they could have because they‚Äôre so similar but I‚Äôm by no means saying that I know for sure they did this for that reason but your toxic ass is up in arms like ‚Äúyeah no they didn‚Äôt and I know that for sure‚Äù shit dude you don‚Äôt even know if they were referencing anime in general just cause it‚Äôs a Japanese plant or if they referenced Sakura who‚Äôs known for the vein popping. Like I said my man just making a connection hop of your pedestal
---
I buyed to
---
Mortis is a ton of fun to play, I'd probably get him because Darryl is easy to get (1% chance from brawl boxes) and gene is also pretty solid. I got mortis today and I absolutely love using him, he's so much fun so if you want the game to feel refreshing then get mortis
---
You could have easily killed at least 2 of them. 
---
Not even flex tape can fix this damage.
---
It's wonderful. Exactly this is what i want!
---
Si
---
I actually bought it cuz I needed coins and had the Gems. 
---
I refused to let one of those things touch me
---
*COMEDY*
---
Lmao facts
---
Idk it's part of the game. Frank can stun the IKE turret, Gene and Tara can pull the bot, Bo's mines stops the bot for a second, Plus Rico, Brock, and Piper can step just inside shoot and get out without getting hit. I think these advantages balance out all things considered... Just keep track of enemy Pennies.
---
Are these real offers
---
Pay2win is the new cool i guess
---
I dont think they have in in sTock

Here in Britan it would be ¬£6000

---
what is that currency even

3 mega boxes isn't *that* much. How many trophies and brawlers do you have?

Leon need more n more nerf  decrease invisibility time to 5 sec and so  other brawler kill easily Leon  thank you and fuck u supercell

That face is pure cringe.

You need to work with your team more or id youre in showdown you have to cater to your brawler. Otherwise youre gonna get rekt everytime

Agreed, its bs the way they calculate it

Don't play tanks on Double Trouble. I don't know about lower trophy levels, but they are completely useless. The modifier doesn't indicate what to play, the map does.

Yeah,I did the same thing in Gem Grab while I had 10 gems. :)

It's far from more than better than NW Mortis... ü§£

It is irritating, but it cannot be called an exploit.

OMG how did u get bull? How many trophies even? And to think that the gene I got yesterday was cool..

Ok liberal

And skins only provide cosmetic benefits, besides by buying those 2 he won‚Äôt drop legendary chance later, helping him more in the long run than skins ever would.

Yeah crow doesn't need a buff the other legendaries need nerfs still

Hmm reminds me of something... maybe it's the Rune cape..

How much was the compensation

Sorry i can't get your comment

missiles explode which has explosion radius so wouldn't that make sense

Why this reminds me pyro from TF2 visiting pyroland?

Just renamed it to Jessie mode

Beacouse she cant speak

Spike socks, crow jacket, and leon hoodie

Those stupid randoms will think they're superior and will not pass ball.
---
i think the ice and teleport trap might be a good idea
---
the others might be too op
---
lmao overpriced much
---
Better than NIGHT BITCH
---
James Charles is disgusting
---
its a strategy
---
It happened because matchmaking  is terrible. And if you had lost and complained about your low trophy teammate, you would be called a noob. 
---
Buddy that's every brawler, do you just want to him to have his time to be OP or something?
---
-10 IQ for linking a YouTube video.
---
You realise how stupid randoms could be with those launch pads?
---
aka people that are starting to lose interest in the game, ergo being basically pointless for people that still play the game frequently.
---
Just don‚Äôt die and you won‚Äôt lose

He is a liar ... I am his friend and this account in the picture is not his account, but a 500 trophy account.

Those are really good

cool, would buy it.

None of the people here complaining about leon probably have him, and those who do are making the argument in Leon's favor. So much bias.

You counter her. Just play smart and try not to die so easily

---
Harsh truth and Well Criticism to teamers right here.
---
Teamers will become cancer if Everyone starts to take the same path and if sc does nothing. SC gave a benefit of doubt in the early stage of the game hoping that players will realise how bad Teaming could be if they make it a habit, Unfortunately That didn't happen and players completely hooked up to the "Easy way" to Push trophies, Teaming doesn't make you better, I repeat It doesn't make you better in terms of skills.
---
Thanks for letting your voice out dude **(„Å•Ôø£ ¬≥Ôø£)**
---
Is your poco ok?
---
I think he/she is *dashing*
---
really bad i got like 30-40 coins and 25 n 25 from a brawl box
---
Yes. 
---
Well how's it
---
Teaming in a modifier is such lame!
---
Nope
---
Just don't want her to be the worst brawler in the game
---
I have 17/23 brawlers, 2.6k trophies. Yeah Leon, spike, all rare and super rare brawlers, all from blue brawl boxes. I‚Äôm pretty sick.
---
There's no obligation to dedicate time or learn about anything, the only thing you need to be doing is having fun lmao, and teaming adds more excitement in showdown 
---
&gt;If you don't like it then don't play it lol stop crying. **Top high players really liked this new mode**. Something new and more competitive.

Yeah. You are only supporting my statements.

Does anyone else notice that people are super fucking bad at this game. Like I‚Äôll be playing and watch real players do shit like this. It baffles me such a simple and easy game to play and master and we have pro plays like this.
---
It's pretty good. But one thing, that one thing ruined everything. Supercell added skin for mortis
---
TRANSGENDER MORTIS
---
Wat new skin for mortis what is it 
---
Is it good
---
But this is big box üòû
---
i never get a plus sign cuz i always lose so eh 
---
It used to be 0?
---
True haha but I still liked him the old way, when he was a real tank with alot more damage...it was better to me than today as an assasin IMO
---
REMODEL THE SKIN TO THIS SUPERCELLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL

It is night witch mortis and he has a lipstick...

Woah that's cool night witch was one of my most faviroute cards ever I am looking forward to the future
---
Jessie and Nita are the best at big game. I can easily get to 3 mins with Jessie and nita. My longest time was 3min 20 with nita and 3mins 10 with Jessie I think 
---
She's dropping turrets like crazy. 
---
Wooow!

How did you know

Enemy team actually has 6 gems.

How?

Good players can get to 3 mins easily. Nita and Jessie dominate big game.

Just close the app. Totally works

Get them, it‚Äôll help you climb trophies and you might as well start getting power ups for them as well

He wins matchups with every brawler besides piper and pam, you can dodge any projectile with his speed and his range is extremely long
---
So are you !

been doing that since he came out lol nothing new

Hello

at one point me and my friends called them ‚Äúmilk‚Äù for jokes

pls leave a comment if  you agree with any of the above to be done

Except new ones!

How.
---
Made for Darryl xddd
---
But u r using jessie too...
---
Shhh don‚Äôt tell anyone but I teamed with the hunters!!
---
I know, I'm part of the problem. But the fact that Jessie and Nita is OP in Big Game has to stop or be resolved.
---
still thats 7s longer than us and our enemy is Frank!
---
The "üò¢" ruined this meme
---
Alright time and time again we don‚Äôt care, r/lootstars
---
Pretty pointless
---
I don't really care about the limit since I play a lot so I never hit the 200 limit. If they were to make it higher they'd have to increase the generation speed.
---
I got big brawler 3x in a row. Definitely have to fix this 
---
"Anyone who lewds me will regret it"
---
What is Mortis star power
---
Sorry cant relate never got a plus sign in siege
---
This is an interesting template in the fact that its not
---
Well, it can still HIT it. 
---
Thank you mr president,very cool!
---
With new updates there is only 2 jessies
---
Finally something we can discus about all the skins are nice but most won't get added.
---
This is what we need.
---
Good job mate!
---
It's my honor future citizen 
---
It says no where that you are guaranteed to get a chance at being the big brawler, it's random so it's working as intended, you just got unlucky. 
---
 I feel like his role is lot more unique now, in overwatch they have dive heroes and that applies to Mortis and Darryl and Leon. Instead of before he had a ridiculous roll and heist was his only good mode
---
In he past 2 times big brawler has came out. Ive played once, ONCE!
---
its not supposed to be 2 digit number as trophy so they will fix it soon
---
???
---
Its magical bow
---
I ran at them with drag mortis (hoping to change opinions XD) and it still took them 36 seconds with 2 turrets XD. 
---
I know. I am just taking my anger out on reddit because I just wasted 30 mins of my life!
---
What do you mean? 
---
No they didnt. They doubled it a few weeks ago
---
How many trophies you have? 
---
-12 for me
---
If someone has way more power on a brawler without many trophies the matchmaking will place that player with someone with the same trophies on a brawler but less power
---
You don't have to be high trophies, anyone with average awareness can notice the cannon. I have never seen a Penny succeed at the infiltration operation, it's just too obvious. 
---
total number of tokens u can possibly get within 20 minutes is 200. every 20 minutes 20 tokens are restored
---
They ‚Äúnerf‚Äù Leon by releasing even more OP brawlers, and making existing ones stronger. Mortis, Gene, Pam, need a nerf!
---
not worth it

---
I don‚Äôt know about you but I‚Äôm consistently seeing teaming getting worse and worse. Ex: a piper teaming with a bull,

A primo teaming with a crow

And they are never backstabbing each other.

Nothing special...

You mean third.
---
Ok ill delete it in 10 secs

Whats a "token chest" ....
---
Amazing
---
XDDD, i thinked about that to
---
They don‚Äôt want to pay 1000 support staff to investigate thousands of reports. Even if it does happen, they‚Äôll probably only action the highest reported players
---
I totally agree with you 
---
I know:3
---
Well I bought Leon with an offer. I meant I got two out of the chests, and one from an offer
---
That‚Äôs not a great time tho :/

It's worse on the other team lol three times in a row I was on teams that had all big brawler wannabes.

&gt;Hahahaha gamers are all crazy
---
You're heavily implying because of a few posts. 
---
They had to take something, they just didn‚Äôt take his hat.
---
That‚Äôs why I only solo showdown until around 220 trophies, then it‚Äôs onto duo. Solo is by far my favorite mode. The fact that we only have 1 solo map a day, and I don‚Äôt like every map, it prevents me from playing at times. Wish we had 2 showdowns available at any given time.
---
Looks cool, but you should try to make those bushes look better
---
2 gang
---
Howerboarddude would be op in this map.
---
did anyone think that MAYBE he was in the lobby with one of them when they readied up??
---
Best I can do is 2 gems, take it or leave it
---
How much trophies are you on
---
thank u. thats what i assumed but wanted to be sure. 
---
Yeah so?
---
I think "elf Bo" would be a more fitting name
---
Haha those event modifiers were originally to help prevent teaming
---
It happened to me while playing with a friend

Leon too

Nope it's 150 gems (what?) now

---
ugh i hate siege i keep losing, i literally lost 3 after that.
---
Ok... Now I want to kids you... I need more... NOW
---
I think it's better if they just enable replays for everyone, that way we can manually report players by sending them to support and there would be less false reports too because that's harder than just tapping a button.
---
When does it go god mode? 50? 100? 
---
Colt is a sherrif not a cowbow you ignorant fuck
---
i laughed more than i should 
---
He was no longer OP since the February update, now he's completely unasable.
---
a really good team if everyone has star powers is Dynamike, Nita, Pam
---
Honor, family, tradition...AND DONUTS!
---
Am not the only one ha?
---
they better fix it
---
I am laughing and crying at this.
---
That and Excel Saga always come to mind when it hits rotation.
---
Brock and piper can outrange the turret and damage it with their regular attacks. Bull can dash at it and get 2 shots on it for 10 percent damage. Nita can use bear to tank for her and go in for a few shots. Colt can super it from outside the line. Bow can put mines on it for when enemy‚Äôs spawn to damage it. Barley and Dinamike can super it from outside the turret. Daryl dash and shield can get a few shots if it‚Äôs open. Pam and Jesse turrets can tank the turret to let a few hits get past. And penny can place her ‚Äúmortar‚Äù (the very weapon designed for seiging the enemy) to hit the safe. 
---
In other words get over it, and learn how to counter it. 
---
Leon played Fortnite but he couldn't build cause he's trash, now he has to build even in Brawl Stars
---
i lost 3 in a row after that lmao, i hate siege
---
Leon is nothing then üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
I like your idea too, good call 
---
You have to get a legendary to reset the legendary chance
---
Maybe fury trap should passively recharge your super like darryl‚Äôs.
---
The players are 3k they didn't start playing yesterday
---
Especially when players afk in big game, moving just enough to not get punished. Thanks for helping me waste tickets.
---
Where is the rng in heist? 
---
He was caught by bo.
---
Bet this guy is a Bull main
---
Haha no
---
then if you could play characters without owing them then what's the point of playing to unlock the brawlers?
---
Thanks brother, maybe there is hope after all
---
So is piper. So is bo. I didn't pick crow because I thought he is good.
---
Even if I picked pam I still get these bad brawlers in my team 99%.  How do you think I lost 100 trophies 
---
Maybe a description of how to achieve them when tapping on each title
---
i don‚Äôt see how that‚Äôs relevant to knowing not to queue with randoms lmfao
---
That's greatly underpowered
---
It would be 70% better if the face is changed
---
It's also can be a new brawler concept
---
You are absolutely right

If you are definitely going to buy the 4.99 deal then don't buy the Rico/Darryl deal. They are both only super rares so you'll easily unlock them without having to spend gems.
---
I mean everyone is at 400-500 trophy level and u see a 9 trophy penny be star player 
---
It used to be yellow like normal events
---
Have mercy for El Primo
---

---

---
Yeah, I made a post about this too, but I only got like ten upvotes on it.
---
That is definitely not how you use this meme tho
---
Can you post them?
---
I can already predict the meta will b shotgunners and ricos
---
Yea nice idea... didnt thought about that 
---
Also other brawlers should get to charge super (albeit at a lower rate) if aimed at a turret/bear. Or else you'd just be killing the turret/bear while Jessie/Nita hits you, and since you've used all 3 hits everybody else can't do damage to Big Brawler.
---
Is matchmaking based on your current trophies with a brawler or your highest? If the latter, perhaps the low trophy guy is just trophy dropping.
---
It is a standard normalization. All probabilities in total must add up to 1. So, if you are only missing legendary brawlers, and cannot get a star power yet, then your chance of getting a legendary brawler would be 0.0528 / (94.2 + 0.0528) = 0.056%.
---
It‚Äôs basically a Leon 2.0
---
That profile is just amazing
---
I know some people don‚Äôt like the changes to the colors but we weren‚Äôt really suppose to be able to do it in the first place, so I find it unlikely that we will get to change the colors.
---
Got my trophies back, thank you!
---
Holy shit this is so cool!
---
Am i the only one that hates that events are now happening in normal showdowns? It totally ruined my fun 
---
just spend some money
---
Why wouldn't you get Carl? He is a super rare so everyone will get him easily through boxes. But if you want him right away they will have an offer for him and this guy has enough gems to buy the offer.  
---
Don't advise someone to buy something with gems that isn't on sale... It's really just a waste, especially since super rares you are guaranteed to pull easily.
---
this is finally a brilliant map tbh great work

brawl stars in a nutshell
---
Hey mmm! Glad to see you so long after :) Thought You would have left playing cr and Idk if your lurk forums anymore.
---
Also I'm glad to share my thoughts with you as I'm playing this game since 1.5 years. But definitely say that you won't be disappointed as much from BS.
---
1) That's very much requested especially for those idiots who self goal in brawl ball, I believe they won't be adding one soon Because It'll open it up for report misusing. Iirc Year ago SC said they are monitoring players from the backend who self goal or game throw, and as far as Afk players are considered, they'll be replaced by bots to avoid Players standing at one position. My take is if Afk/throwers players increase in this game they would add report button to control it.
---
2) After the global release MM is now restricted to Regional mostly, reducing the chances of server lag. Frank (game lead of BS) has recently given an explanation for Lag just to make things clear, https://twitter.com/Frank_Supercell/status/1100329407988854785?s=19
---
Me personally I'd blame my stupid net and I'm fine if lag happens because i expect more quicker matches rather waiting for that one perfect match. Lol
---
3) I seriously hate teaming, it's skill less and I can understand why report button straight isn't an option, Or how would you detect mass teaming. Long ago they said they're fine with teaming just because they ""don't want to supress players" around how to play the game. It was fine until it only gotten worse at higher levels and I would say they have did some efforts like Constant map changes and bringing Modifiers to Reduce/disadvantage teaming.  I hope they'll come up with more effective solution to Supress teaming. Kairos Time youtuber has done a great job by creating a movement called #stopthespin and encourage players to backStab teamers or take brawlers that can stand well against teamers.
---
4) Yeah Indeed, The thing is what i have experienced in brawl stars is All brawlers will be ""viable"" in at least one gamemode, one map. And SC will try to Balance them keeping in mind that these brawlers will be more viable in much Gamemodes and maps. But I don't always feel discouraged to take a non meta brawler in a gamemode/map. Unlike CR
---
Sorry if my answers were vaugeüòù have a great day.

Why thank you! :)

His star power gives you quite an advantage too!
---
There's actually a delay before jump pads activate so its possible to just walk thru them
---
Surely Supercell is thinking about a 5v5. But as we saw in Siege, they don‚Äôt want simplistic/cliche game modes
---
3k with no mythic or legendary
---
What‚Äôs gonna happen if a crow were to jump into the middle of the walls?

Oh my god I'm tired of people saying it's amazing how they got a brawler in a normal box, you'll get most of your brawlers from normal boxes anyway, that's not clash royale.

I did it already

Could you elaborate? People have been suggesting club wars for a very long time. What we need is how we should be executing it
---
I have his star power and it‚Äôs actually really underrated. Him being able to move faster means he is able to run away from certain brawlers, dodge, pick up stuff. Game changer

but easter egg has  Unknown power :0

Same here

Removed - DO NOT SUBMIT POSTS WITH TITLES IN ALL CAPS. CAPS LOCK IS CRUISE CONTROL FOR COOL

I recieved 30 tokens though. If it had only registered 1 rank up, i should get 10 tokens + the token doubler for 20 tokens. I got 30 though, so it seems like one of the rank ups didnt get doubled.

Alright, this post completely ignores that even at 500 there's still about one small team every game and that most teamers constantly worry about backstabbing and some teamers like myself follow the Mortis gang ideology and don't actually suck at the game
---
I really want to see you drawing. Good luck
---
Remove white crow then add tis

Won 118 trophies with Jessie in Siege, you just have to be lucky I guess

Well this is my first day on reddit, im truly sorry ma dude :)
---
 If you know how to use Photoshop, you can get crow with the automatic selection tool. :)
---
It speaks facts: teaming is bad, randoms are usually bad, but then somehow connects those two. If you look at it my way, teaming is actually a viable strategy. Tell me, how much teamwork and trust would you need to have to team with a random person whose name you don't even see, and trust that they won't backstab you when half the reddit community are talking about backstabbing? The answer is: a lot.   
---
Now, what do we need to play with randoms well? Teamwork and trust. Therefore, teaming increases your skill in playing with randoms. Therefore, if you see a good random, chances are that he is a teamer. The problem with bad randoms is those who sit out in bushes in solo showdown until they are top 4.  
---
So that I do not cause confusion, I will immediately state that I've tried teaming only twice. It was below 300 both times so I saw the guy's name. One was a backstabber, and another was probably the best player I've seen.
---
[Gonna have to one-up you on this one.](https://i.imgur.com/5CFZp45.jpg)
---
Nope, just -80 trophies on me Darryl
---
I honestly don't like teaming ... but it's the only way to win . Because everyone is teaming. You can't play it without teaming . I really like to see the natural solo showdown  . Life leech stopped teaming completely and it was my favorite game mode. But suddenly supercell removed it . 
---
Na he has less than 3K but he was a good player 
---
Do u have moving background of the menu screen where skull moving

Is this guy surely doesn't know how piper works 
---
Remove 1 tile gaps and it'll be perfect
---
Why are you speaking spanish with him? He is speaking portuguese
---
They should just remove them. They make the game look less polished, and it is kind of a glitch. So don't complain
---
thank you. If i upload a video, I will announce it through my Instagram. Because speaking in reddit is not related to Brawlstars.  :)

He farded and pissed and shidded and nutted his pants
---
But I just noticed that my legendary drop rate dropped, instead of my mythic drop rate. Is it normal?
---
I‚Äôd like to change it too and in my opinion it should be free
---
They can also increase the time to reach a ‚Äúwin‚Äù from 2:20 to 3:20 for brawlers that can spawn things like Nita and Jessie 
---
At laest you have a legendary OP. Most of us are still waiting for their first.
---
why though i like them and i have the reason. imagine your ike has 93% and the opponent's 2% and you lose because they built overpowered robot with one more bolt and you couldnt just quickly get close to the ike and cheap it out ü§î i know the feeling, thats exactly how i lost once üò∂

Wow, perfect skin, man. How to make skin idea? Photoshop?

Very good. "Cowboy Penny" is better

I‚Äôm guessing that the penny and the bill were in a team together and you were just the random they matched with
---
Ïò§.. thats cool 
---
Good idea
---
Absolutely agree man ! That little bastard turret has like 10k health and once you kill it, she will mostly have it up again. VERY ANNOYING ! 
---
Well what's your goal?
---
 r/punpatrol open up, puns where I see them
---
Piper goes **SICKO MODE**
---
I haven‚Äôt played against bots from beta, if that‚Äôs the case I guess you are in the same situation as me where you have all your brawlers 500+ and some others at 600 and the gameplay is not good duo to the teaming and terrible match making.. I would also like a game type like this but the trophy system in my opinion is not good for the long run you can actually see this in other supercell games. 
---
I agree
---
Why?
---
Think about it my dude, this would start a cycle where people would drop in trophies to where there are less experienced/lower levels players to rise up again. New players would be farmed for tickets.
---
Getting a Legendary brawler?
---
IQ: Infiny
---
So you‚Äôre losing profit... and how are you suppose to get to the enemy side?
---
Nice skin! It even fits the way he is played!
---
Funny how its for the worst one in the game. Good job on the art, though, I could never make something that looks thisnice. 
---
They should make it so when you throw them they come back and deal damage and slow people, exactly like talon from league of legends
---
well shit, all 3 in 1 sitting
---
Am i only one who thinks support is lying. 
---
Who killed who?
---
I think you should be able to report teaming. The get +1 trophie per kill might work. I know supercell probably doesn't want to end up light banning a bunch of players, but I think it would fix the problem

Aparently Supercell wants me to buy mithics, because past month I had an offer for Mortis and Tara

Going around, using the bounce pad, or breakimg the wall

maybe making a tiny gap in the middle river or putting a more central bouncepad might balance it out. its a cool map otherwise!

maybe it was some seconds more but somthing around this
---
You say that but looking at the map you can‚Äôt really ‚Äúgo around‚Äù, the bounce pad aims for the center, and by the time you get a super to break a wall whoever that is there probably up or don‚Äôt have to
---
But both teams are alwats either on their side, or in the middle unless they spawned a robo.

Thank you! :D I will try to redraw it tommorow

Ok thats a good idea if you ever wanna play i put a link in this post somewhere to add me thanks

You're right.I put them because I didn't no what to ad to my map.

lol but he wants like a friendly game with randoms not with friends

They won‚Äôt add it people have asked for it in clash Royale and the closest they got was 2v2

No hat Mortis is still a Mortis, you may respect his condition as the same way that you respect Rockabilly Mortis, because if only hats are important...
---
Night witch Mortis has a hood. Rockabilly Mortis haven't a hat.
---
Think on it D:
---
God that sucks.
---
Saving private penny should be a whole new game mode if this skin comes out
---
Shhhh the tilt is real
---
Things that nobody accepts because they can not stand the truth: Mortis's new model is much better and more polished than the old one.
---
I personally think that this is my personal best map, looks and creativity wise.
---
Especially if you consider that Poco only heals for 700 fucking hp
---
Shitpost garbage 
---
Good job mate. You have patience.
---
"Rico enters the chat"

Lol wtf

Why did you have to point out bo at 3k everyone knows

Looks very nice and is unique. I would definitely  buy this skin

Wait

That's why you shouldn't play with random

What do you mean with us

Have much fear, my little friend is here

hmmm

Gonna post new version asap

Ok, another brancell gone from my body

I figured that would be the best idea, and do you know roughly how long it would be? If there's any consistency to it 
---
It will depend on the feedbacks
---
I guess mid-march
---
These shorts are so cute, i want to see more animations about BS
---
oh

If you can aim around the corners with Nita he's a 100% good pick.

Dyna jump is borderline useless

Oh fuck it looks like Dynamike escaped from the mine because of Canary he loves his Canary and he doesn't wan it to die

With the robot rumble new *glitch discovered by it. I would say yes

XDDD They seems very strange in this old design!
---
Hey does the app still running well? I so encountered some issue whereby it says try again later.. 
---
Nice catch
---
I wonder how could they not have brothers 
---
Exactly what I thought lol, they might replace it with water if it comes to the game.
---
I mean neither did anyone else. Triple damage 5 power cube piper can one shot a lot of things.
---
Thats sad just sad
---
Why ?
---
My boner is confused
---
Nah, save gems instead to buy them in shop. It takes a while but the feeling when you get your brawler is worthbit.
---
Looks fun to play
---
Congrats but should i care?
---
And other top players in fact number one player thinks it's not so bye lmao
---
You're retarded

Good idea for easter. So they could have an easter event and use this skin along with other ones like egg Daryl or bunny leon

What is that

PLEASE SUPERCELL THIS HAS TO HAPPEN FOR EASTER

4.99 gets you 80 and 9.99 gets you 170.  This is over $200.
---
Yeah, Rip Life leach
---
Crow is like 730 gems which is around $70
---
They need to nerf spawnables. It's unfair that Pam's turret heals 46 health while Jessie's turret deals 10000 damage and Nita's bear goes Sicko mode. 
---
If they nerf spawnables, at least Jessie's shots bouncing will only be slightly OP. 
---
Life Leech was a Showdown modifier where you permanently lose health and must hit the enemies for survive.
---
This meme is made to bash the infamous Mortis gang 
---
And then they fixed that one too, with robots now going straight for the safe rather than being distracted by players.
---
just scroll down bro

She needs a super nerf honestly, it charges way to fast
---
Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!? Abauagabaua
---
If Bull buff is 0% why is it on the graph.
---
I LOVE your work! But I don't think all of those suggestions should be in the game, in fact, I think the majority should not. BS has a certain "theme" of skins and I think most of your suggestions, beautiful as they are, are not fitting into that theme. In any way , this is MY opinion and your art is amazing, there is no doubt there.
---
*OwO, what's this? * It's your **1st Cakeday** Alexgd01! ^(hug)

I think a good indirect buff to her or other brawlers like her like el primo or bull is to let grass grow again

Nice Deadpool hoodie!

fucking filthy teamer

I‚Äôd prefer not I‚Äôm near max I just get coins and I get near 100 coins from a single brawl box and about 120 at most from big boxes

When you get to high trophies you‚Äôll see the same in every game mode because everyone wants to win

Hey,I see how you've done this,this is a copy and paste of a post I have done but no one has seen,you dont have to say yes but I would like some sort of way that you have seen it:I have a really good idea for a new brawler but I cant animate,I've done a drawing on a peace of paper but I'm not a good drawer,I have been seeing people that can draw a brawler like he was in game on a computer and I was wondering if anyone can help me draw it,I dont want my concept of the brawler stolen so I'm not saying who the brawler is but if you are a good artist that can draw on a screen, contact galaxyeyes616@gmail.com

No El Primo allowed on the island!

I am at almost 9k trophies so I know what you mean but event should be something slightly different. Not to mention you can switch brawlers around in high trophies to counter a team you keep losing to. You can't do that with events
---
Just like his account "-999 gems"

OMGoodnes this is the best map I've ever seen!

The luck percendage drops when you actually found a brawler in a box, not when you buy one

Nerf Jessie‚Äôs turret and Nita‚Äôs bear in Big Boss 
---
That happens to me all the time with leon
---
totally agree, and other reason why i decided to push shelly to 500 first
---
Thank you ! üòâ
---
Yes but problem is that in a game of gem grab you need a 3 specific brawlers to make a combo and if not you get crushed, then showdown everyone tries to kill you because you are mortis or just any other brawler that seems a threat to the teams in ‚Äúsolo‚Äù showdown...

Me and my friends figured this out yesterday and we proceeded to use it on others

What the hell did Will Smith and Green Nita do in a single box?!
---
Another solution could be that the more the cannon misses, the more accurate it gets, until it hits someone, then the process starts again.
---
Are you insane? Do you suffer from a mental illness?
---
Nice. 
---
It's a whole lot easier to win and push at low levels
---
I‚Äôd say maybe far into the future if his becomes the weakest. But how would you even change it? A buff is almost out of the question. Do you really want a high DPS ranged shooter that can outrun even Crow and Leon? I could see a rework that gives him buffed movement or reload speed upon taking damage (with a cooldown of course). But otherwise I‚Äôd leave him be. Penny and Crow need more work. 
---
Cyber bullying 
---
I think there should be another solo gamemode. Other option would be to ban people for some time.

I don't even think he's that unique. Everything he does, someone does better.

Just make it only 500+ thropies brawlers can get it.

And watch getting teamed

Definitely like the concept! Could even add lifeleech and call it tug of war üëÄ that would somewhat balance ranged brawlers in such a small map. 
---
Haha yeah!!! Spamming the everliving fuck out of auto-aim is so skilled
---
*Thicco mode*
---
That's interesting, cause I'm not. Cavern churn is a map that favors shot gunners for sure. But not exclusively. It also favors throwers, really good crow players, bo, gene and especially Rico (my personal favorite). Mike does especially well there as does spike (no surprise), and on rare occasions star power Piper. Although she camps, so that one may not be that fair. 
---
Feast or famine is also a unique one. There's definitely going to be a bull, primo or Shelly in the middle. Think of it like the crocodile in the moat. But the middle is a kill box where the first third of all players are gonna go die with only one left alive. Instead try to drive other players around the map. Brock and Colt are good at that. If you can push them they'll likely get ganked by someone else or, when weak, killed by "the crock". No sweat of your brow though. You're net teaming with the Crock.... they're just a tool to get you closer to the end.

Granted you'll likely take second on both these maps, but at least you ranked and you have your honor.

u/Frank_supercell Are this fake??? 
---
Death star
---
the memories of v2 brawl stars, the crests are back
---
Lol supercell needs to fix their game in so many different ways
---
Thanks! =)
---
Lmao. He's at 62 trophies. What did you expect?
---
This is probably the most amazing thing I've seen in my entire life. If I could afford gold I'd give you some.
---
Fp, checked his account hes at 4k+
---
What‚Äôs fishy with shooting people in the bush? Sometimes you know they‚Äôre in it beforehand, sometimes you just gotta check before going in there. 
---
Thank you! =)
---
simple but funny
---
also top hat mortis should be the only mortis skin
---
Damn it
---
That would be actually really interesting üòÇ
---
*seeing an enemy piper fire a perfectly led shot just as you‚Äôre about to land
---
Did he score by accident or did he take the ball and walked in the goal
---
xd,it's like 2x2 in clash royale
---
This sounds amazing üî•üòç
---
And I'm at 3000 trophies and 0 legendaries 0 mythics
---
Nice mustache
---
Lol tru
---
He walked it in twice, only reason I scored once was because I was quick enough to get the ball, im pretty sure he was trophy dropping/gaining unfairly with the mortis
---
I see
---
I rarely play Rico and I got his lvl 10 for some reason
---
It‚Äôs a new offer so you get it anyways
---
I know but it's sadder that the enemy team didn't realize that a 9 trophy penny is wreaking their ass
---
The meteors are not tryna see a nita make it
---
I don't agree with "cool"
---

The picture is broken

A phone probably met a fatal end after this game. RIP. 
---
He‚Äôs is a throw pick on brawl ball now.  And yeah he is one of the best, especially in gem grab.  He won‚Äôt be able to take out a Pam, but if your teammates get her to 3000 you can easily kill her, take the gems and win the game, as well as other brawlers.  
---
But if a highly reactive chemical is inadequate tube and is thrown it could explode. Peppers exploding still doesn't make sense but it's a game so 
---
V good
---
let him live, he doesnt deserve the torture
---
Love the design elements incorporated in the skin. You‚Äôre really pushing the boundaries of art here. 
---
If your network is bad just close the app so a bit will take over. Simple solution dont be an asshole and make your team lose
---
Man I miss Dumpling Darryl. Tried to save gems to get him but was all in vain.
---
I hope we get to see him next lunar year.

It‚Äôs the new way to avoid people making groups on discord to die at the same time

I was in one of his steams and phonecats streams I didn't even know they were streaming lol
---
Yup
---
This would be great, send it to Ryan and frank on twitter for sure!

Any zelda fan would disagree with a chicken being weak

Just a regular day at the office

Good bot. It's by me

If only there was a fifth slot that doesn‚Äôt have an event for 5/7 days in a week, that could serve as a slot for showdown with event modifiers. Well, I wish there was an simple solution.
---
Seriously though, the weekend event slot should be used for showdown with modifiers during the weekdays and then have the ticket events during the weekends.

Dude... white crows are a thing (albino crows) lel

They need to just make each spawnable have a set amount of hits required instead of HP. Like 4 hits so one player can't just solo it quickly on a full reload, but still make it easy enough that it doesn't sit there as a 4th player for a full minute. Buffs it against it's biggest weakness(throwers) but nerfs it against everything else, yet in a fair way.
---
This is a dope idea! 
---
Can't say exactly, my experience was limited to this single episode.  
---
I guess if you're an expert Mortis you can last longer, but 3-4 mins should be a standard I guess. 8 mins may means bad players or simply not so coordinated.
---
Ahah why not
---
it doesn't even target groups of people, i see meteors target random walls instead of the 3 teamers over there
---
what song is that from?
---
Best Photoshop ever?

How did u see people in the bush??
---
I bought it. It may be ugly but it‚Äôs a deal plus it may get a polish and I have plenty of gems to spare
---
Hey grumpydino, I think we‚Äôre in-game friends! My name is ItsMeMario
---
I have heard that it targets people who are close to each other and are not recieving  damage
---
Adorable...

After you buddy. He's useless. so are you.
