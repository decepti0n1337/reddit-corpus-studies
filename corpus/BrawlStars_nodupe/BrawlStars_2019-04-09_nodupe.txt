Seems odd how SC  makes you lose trophies for a bot taking over when you crash at the start

This is from u tube

 Hey I made a post about this too!

Walk around it would make it better and do more things than just attack

Crow does not need a buff as long as you don’t use him like bull.

People will be playing bull as crow after the buff

Thanks! (I'll try to do better next time I guess lol)

I kill so many mortis as dynamike lol. Just use one shot where they are and another in the direction that they will attack. This way, you can kill the mortis before it gets close to you and even if it does some damage you will out health the other person.

Lol 6999 trophies

Good question

I thought it was a lot when I got 7 Pams and 3 Colts at 300 trophies yesterday.

This is a big problem in the lower trophy ranges. Like, the only reason to throw a game is to intentionally drop trophies. But half the time, the dudes that throw the game are that low in trophies that they don’t even lose any.
---
Seriously, why can’t they just play solo showdown and give their trophies to everyone else?

I thought my 300 trophie Colt going down to 200 trophies was bad. F.

How?

It just means he played at an earlier time and unlocked Dynamike while he was a common

Ohhhhhh

They had an account before trophy road and unlocked Jessie normally out of a brawl box instead of how you now unlock her

well this is the 1st i’ve seen on hot post soo
---

Good use of walls and grass. I would advise you stay away from placing power up boxes inside of grass heaps since they end up looking bad in game. Also water along the edges don’t add much gameplay wise and just are a waste of space imo. The edges could have been used better.

Red Bull gives you wings
---
Agreed!  There are plenty of maps right now.  How about more brawlers???  Or how about an update to the trophy road that includes better rewards after 3k or 4K?  How about an update to the store so that more brawlers are available for sale more often (like legendary/mythic ones!). 
---
How about a chance to “prestige” your account and restart from scratch.  You Lee all your brawlers but their trophies and power point levels all get rebooted to 0. Give some sort of special skin or reward or choice of reward for prestigeing.  Maybe you get 1 free maxed out player?  Maybe you can only prestige your trophy road but your brawlers all stay the same???  
---
Something so that when you get bored grinding out 500 trophies, you can restart from scratch (without losing your unlocked brawlers).
---
Yes
---
I didn't know one of our kind could have this "girlfriend" thing

You use to not unlock brawlers on trophy road

tbh, i do want him buffed. however, now that i got 500 trophies w/crow &amp; he's lvl 6, my first &amp; only 500 hahaha, it's like, idk. tricky. but ya maybe a small small health buff. small.
---
what
---
Ok. I have some more creative ideas that I will post in the future. Thanks for being honest so I know how to improve.

no u

I would play darryl but instead of using my super to get to the ball I would just roll in circles

Oh i see

If u dont get it, its because he is lying, and so his nose is getting longer... and yeah... (so when he says “crow doesnt need a buff”, his nose gets longer). Sorry if i misinterpreted what you were asking lol

I remember u as "person who made my crests idea better" lmao

Do u remember this incident?

Nice idea but doesn't Rico's king skin already shoot those?

A couple of days ago my friend walks up to me and says “there really should be an Easter dynamike skin. It would match his star power perfectly! An Easter egg could be his super.” I’m glad to see that someone is actually designing one!

Would hurt squishes too much, more bigger characters would be played, and they would be more aggressive

Oooh boy that would be INSANELY OP. The crowd control he could have with that would be way to much. All he really needs is his star power pick speed to become his default and have his star power increase it further/get a new star power, likely related to his super. If it were up to me, his new star power would increase his movement speed both normally and while spinning by 20% of his speed before star, so say he moves 100 normal and 200 in super. He would then move 120 and 240 respectively.
---
Same, what was its name!

Wtf is shelley

What is this form of propaganda?

I see you photoshopped dyna's name out of the picture, meaning it was likely a bot game with your friends

Honestly I feel like most people miss the point of Crow. He seems more of a “prevent healing” character rather than a “final blow” character. This isn’t bad (it’s actually pretty annoying to play against), it’s just not what first comes to mind when you see “toxic assassin.”

It’s called corner wall clipping, Gene isn’t the only brawler that can do that. It’s actually more of an advantage for brawlers like Gene and Nita to be able to wall-clip since they have low damage output

this reminds me of the fish from the 2010 computer-animated film "[Megamind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megamind)"

After you lose about 2,000 trophies in showdown, “Hmm... maybe Morris doesn’t work well on the map ‘Double Trouble,’..... nah, I’m probably just bad, I should try again.”

You joke, but I would love to see this be an actual skin.

Bruh the rewards are literally the same like 10 regular boxes and you know regular boxes are super easy to get, you can't just get a new brawler because it's a bigger box right then and there, you shouldn't hope so hard for a mega box. Only brawler I got from big boxes was Frank and I'm only missing Leon and Gene.
---
wait if he has 4 rockets on his launcher why doesn't Brock have 4 attacks (doubt 100)

---
same situation for me; I couldn't tell if it was a 8 year old or a troll
---
but your teaming too WTF
---
The rank system (Trophies) as it is now is complete shit to predicting skills.
---
As of what we have right now, the way to MAYBE predict skills with the highest possible accuracy (Still not as high as it should be due to the shitty skill indicator) is to compare trophies to level to game type wins.
---
The lower your level with the higher your trophy and the more 3v3 wins, the better the player. Now this way yields the best result as the lower your level, the fewer games you've played. Couple that with high trophies and it suggests that you have a decent win rate. The reason why game type matters is because pushing in showdown really doesn't require as much skill as pushing in 3v3. This is a FACT. I am not discrediting players that push by showdown, I've seen a lot of good players push by showdown. But the fact remains that comparing showdown and 3v3, 3v3 takes more skills to proceed in trophies.
---
This way of predicting skill comes with quite a few problems:
---
1. Good players tend to get more "Star player". The EXP you gain from being star player is 2.02x the normal amount, meaning the good players will actually level faster too.
---
2. Trophy is still heavily reliant on the amount of brawler you got. If you only have 10 brawlers, it is extremely difficult to push past the 5k mark. Possible but way harder. So the game as it is now with this trophy system, Luck plays a huge part.
---
3. Brawler level definitely matters to some extent. This is a relatively f2p player-friendly game and brawler level really doesn't matter as much as some people would suggest, and though I am not discrediting any player that paid money to boost progress, it remains a fact that someone with higher level brawler than average will have a relatively easier time progressing in trophies.
---
Although there are disadvantages (A lot of them) with this method, it is by far the best we got other than playing with said player to see for yourself if they are good.
---
Supercell really need to update their competitive indication system. The trophy system now is really really shit and I won't be surprised if this flaw becomes one of the reasons this game slowly dies off some point in the future. Hopefully, this game does well though, I enjoy it.
---

That sounds alot better, even if they made the chance for a spin on an RNG wheel each day that'd give incentive for people to hop on.

Dude there’s always gonna be people like that. No reason to name and shame. and I’m pretty sure that’s against some of the reddit rules 😗😗😗
---
Oh, wow i didn't know that
---
You could start with that one card with your name and some numbers on it. That might be a good suggestion Supercell can persuade us to get more involved in Brawl Stars.
---
Welp, i laughed harder then i should have.
---
It’s alright I believe you 😉
---
500 more like 100
---
I'd be more accurate if they said "Mío" instead of "Mine"

What’s the problem?

I did it. Thanks!

It came out way better than I thought it would. Would you like to see it? It's not perfect. It's on phone. But I tried my best lol
---
Good
---
PiPer oP😉
---
Also, it helps against brawlers like Shelly where if they were to spam AA (cuz you’d get close during your super for max tarot card damage), they’d aim at the wrong guy.

They played well. But we had better comp and good players so we controlled the map and the match. But i hated it not being as back and forth as seige should be . I know what it feels like to be on the receiving end of this . What are your opinions?Is seige broken or is it a good game mode or will it be good with some changes and some polish?

Ask GEDI if you can use his bot to get upvotes

I don't know if one clip proves anything. Crow is only really good when he has his Super charged up. Which takes a really long time- in this video I get 2.5 kills before finally charging it up again. Compare that to Shelly who can charge up her super just from a few hits.

I don't know where you live, but you have to look at local leaderboards. In my country, club #200 has a cup limit of 0. If that's not the case for your country, you can change your location in settings to a smaller (English speaking) country.

You have the night witch skin on...so....I'm not sure which thing I hate more. :)

Eloquently stated, thorn launcher

Petition to have him self-damage his allies if his dynamite hits them
---
Seriously though, Siege is win it or lose it; if your a Penny and your other teammates are a Shelly and Poco whilst the enemy team has a good combo of a thrower, aggro and support, your basically dead. Siege is probably the only game mode in-game where you actually need a team to win.

He... he doesnt have random DMG...

Pfft youre luckky... im at 5.6k trophies and have several brawlers that need upgrades some of which can be upgraded to max. Yet i only got 16 gold. XD

Sounds to good to be to be true, mine is like -7 most of the matches lol.

If I had a bot all my posts would get 4K upvotes. And if people get suspicious i’ll add about 2-3 comments to make it look legit. 4K upvotes and 2 comments. Can the bot be a little less obvious

At least it's confirmed that where getting a Carl or crow buff
---
His star power jump could have a rocket animation
---
its only missing the camponated cross on his shoulderband
---
It's obsidian! It takes like, 10x longer!
---
Leave emotes out.We suffered from clash royale too long.
---
i have most of my brawlers at 350+ so low ig but pushing Carl past 260 is impossible if he doesn't get a buff me and supercell will have a bone fo pick
---
A surprising amount of players, almost a third, have this issue. Which has led me to push almost solely on Solo SD.
---
I wonder, what's your trophy count?

repost

After global launch.

Don't forget the energy and effort expended.

I remember when crow was fcking OP and now is ok but please,crow really dont need a buff,just learn how to play him...Much time ago Crow was a big headache and i really dont want too see crow op again... PLEASE STOP ASKING CROW BUFF AND LEARN TO PLAY HIM.
---
The ending was hilarious! Nice play!
---
What's your name?
---
A 2% decrease on both of Darryl’s shots is still a 2% decrease on the total

Facts,Crow dont need a buff Just some pople need to learn how to play him...

The ultimate kill steal

Isn't that annoying?

That's less than one legendary in ten thousand. Just because you got everything OTHER than legendaries. This is so unfair, Supercell, fix your damn luck system.

Tell me how am I poor. Also why would you make fun of a poor person in the first place. I'm just a kid.
---
It's still unfair
---
I dOn'T kNoW!
---
Every mode except siege, solo showdown, and ticketed events.
---
I'm going to tell you the same thing. Not all throwers are teamers. Some actually have skill. Have a good day!
---
well you did neglect the fact that I did apologize and I explained what I meant by it and it wasn't anything negative which I was misunderstood for
---
Wait this would actually be great
---
OwO
---
It would be sick if when he used his star power and got blasted off the ground, a little flame would come out of the rocket on his back as if it was propelling him into the air.
---
remind me why supercell thought putting a lock on trophy limits at 400 was a good idea?
---
Use the (#)

Man I remember back in the days when bb was really famous and it was a game I played for hours each day

The Emotes. They are rage inducing in CR.  Seeing someone spin after they kill me is enough.

Make a fast-food Leon that shoots Nachos with cheese on them... Also make a maid Piper... I have way more suggestions lol... I just hope GEDI-KOR uses one.

Forest Fairy Or Spirit for Spike or Leon

Carl as a tank

Lumberjack Frank(Or Mortis)

what do you think the stories is behind each brawlstar character or just the stories behind the game itself I'm trying to do some research for a friend and he was doing a graphic novel on brawlstars if anyone can help that would be great

Another Nita PFB

i cant believe you're at 500 cups on brawlers and dont know this

Taken from carl.exe the video

his pistols could be a silenced pistol like in hitman or something like that

Hi,my comment was for people who spams to buff crow and posts buff crow,im already tired to see that,and when i see people typing about crow buff i just post my comment for those guys.
---
U are right,Crow probably needs some little change but already he is good.
---
GAME CROSSOVER SKINS! FUC YEA!!!!!!!!
---
Maybe that was a fake like dis
---
I'll much rather prefer if crow got his scars from bull.Like bull grabbed him and beat the living hell out of him.He is the biggest and most serious character in the game and yea.
---
Wham
---
Piper finna get piped
---
Well guess what, bucko! The games getting a MAJOR update! Check it out!
---
Yeah, I only play clash royale for 2v2 now that I'm at 4000+ trophies as 1v1 can be really annoying depending on the current meta. And to be fair clash royale was globally released for about a year before they added 2v2 and even then it was just suppose to be temporary. The games have different devs and I think they've done a great job, theres already 7 game modes not including ticketed events I'd say that's quite a lot of love compared to clash royale they also listen to the community a lot more. Theres a new update being announced soon and it's been a while so there might be a lot of new exciting features just a week away!
---
WHAM\*

Played as Barley in Showdown. Leon kept stealing my power cubes, so I make it my mission to chase him and kill him no matter what. He tries to run away but gets killed by a bush camping Bull. I team with said bull and we get 1st and 2nd place.
---
If its within a few levels that's one thing, the biggest problem is if your a lvl 6 vs a lvl10... if it was a lvl 9 that's atleast doable but the star power helps a lot actually if you know how to use it...
---
I wAnT mY mOmMy!
---
And then his super is just him actually appearing.
---
I already thought they looked similar. Now you go do this...    You should make Pessie Xd
---
When you first get spike, you may die a lot he’s very squishy. Packs a huge punch but difficult to play at level 1
---
In the other had
---
Frankly, that pun was tarabull
---
Looks like he’s touching his D
---
I vote "all of the above"
---
Playing every day since Android release, I never encountered a single visual bug. Just me?
---
 Well, for that there are boxes that increase your health and increase your attack, try to get the most you can and you'll see that Crow will be OP
---
Yeah I know right. Like how do they even mess that up? Do they expect their map to just automatically show up?
---
I’d guess yeah, but I could be mixing his videos with other ppls. All the youtubers just mesh into one aside from Kairos and Cory
---
That’s only 2x value, the real temptation is the welcome pack

I will always remember this, in my bightmares

Lol wht tht primo need to win is to walk straight to u, but instead he walked back and forth to step  in all ur attack 🙈

It's the universal sign for "I'm a sore winner with no sportsmanship"
---
I love your work Gedi-kor! Keep it up! ;)
---
Farmer Mortis Would Be good
---
I don’t. But this is common enough that there’s no reason to fake it
---
The accessories are just some random shit I put. I mean mostly in solos but duos too.
---
Crow should be lower seeing that more than half the people who play him say he needs a buff
---
There's a report button??? Where is that?

1. BS | 2. CR | 3. BB | 4. COC
