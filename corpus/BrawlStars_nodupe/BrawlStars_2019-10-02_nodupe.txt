Why did you say this 9 times?!?!

I thought it was supposed to be a mask XD ,LOL

No everyone knows I’m right even tho it’s a party pooper thing to say

It's how many times you use a shelly to kill them close range

nah, same thing as a brawler, probably was a big box

I, Giorno Giovanna, have a Legendary Brawler

First thing I’m not a copy I just like editing and brawl stars so I thought i could try to start my own YouTube because I have always wanted to https://youtu.be/fLGtSRP6a7g that’s my YouTube if anyone wanted to see
---
Thanks for being a bummer dude
---
Its 300 like phoenix crow
---
mortis’s skin should be named gordon ramsay instead then
---
Good content, though
---
Everyone loves chemistry
---
Fair enough
---
Leon has been touched too much, and he isn't actually unique bc sandy has invis too. I feel like Sandy's sandstorm should decrease reload speed, because thats a mechanic not in the game yet.

8-Bits second star power isn't that powerful anymore.
---
I mean the longer you played the, more experienced you are so you'll be better. If you have 12k trophies, theoretically you would be better than someone who has 1k trophies.
---
Idk bout that
---
Having fun

Add fences on the edge of each island?

Ok thanks for that :)

Yes, though my username seems to suggest that :)

Learn to make memes if you going to make memes
---
Gold mecha Bo is just yellow mecha Bo. Gold is far from that color.
---
How about the match below u lost despite being fair
---
Well then play other games that needs that brawl stars is not about how cool you look its about having fun playing with friends so many gamemodes to play and not one

i have a 280d one and what hurts the most is that we always played sc games together and he just didnt like bs :(
---
Time to delete Brawl Stars, all my efforts where in vain and even tho I'm not even close to max all brawlers, power level wise I have them all at or above 500
---
Nah
---
I lagged out one time in the middle of a really good match, was about to snap my phone in half...
---
 Just as I was about to destroy my phone the game logged back in and went to home screen ..

quickly I noticed I  had free 2000 gems.

What a blessing in disguise.

Should? I have to push Mortis to 800, Poco to 750 and Dynamike to 700 and other brawlers to 550, I shouldn't be there fpr having one brawler near 1k trophies I should be there for having all the legendaries at 500 like everyone else like the norm

People: but you just got to the goal at overtime in like 15 seconds and.... oh
---
What is this logic? You still spend more time playing per day on the game so that's more total
---
I realize that spread is better, but the way you take fights with Sandy makes it not as important as it is for poco
---
Atleast I tried
---
We’re talking dummy thicc
---
Well i have a friend who is last on 110 days ago

He has 3 legendarys and 5 lv 10s

I made a comment 4 days ago same idea let's chill with the whole it's my idea and be glad he made a great skin.
---
What about Tick?
---
Looks kinda like Avatar Last Airbender idk
---
Happened to me with a box before, you just have to edge up against the corner at the max
---
I saw some thing where it hit a Carl with super and it hit him like 5 times
---
Can I put this in shellygang
---
That's Snappy Sniping
---
Oh ok I always get confused

I think he's saying crow is legendary but isn't OP so legendary doesn't necessarily mean OP
---
and a legendary?! this ain't fair
---
I love the way they enlarged Rico's image lok
---
I assume they put it through a font changing website or just downloaded the font and copy/pasted it here.
---
I just noticed that lmao Can't believe i missed it while editing it 😂😂😂
---
Can you share me the link?

Bee afraid...
---
VERY afraid...

I was the OP, he just got it famous and pasted it on everything.

FFFFFFFFFFF

soooo?

No, because Star Shelly is a rare skin
---
Uhhh, you know there are a ton of them right?
---
For those that dont understand...just watch the other team trying to score....and our retarded primo aswell
---
Hes in the same trophy range as you. So does it really matter?

They have insta reflexes

A bot should've taken over. But whatever

Eng: Darryl is my favorite brawler and this is my idea for a his future skin

---
[removed]
---
Can i get the template?
---
Why did you use emojis
---
I'm missing all the legendaries.
---
You did a 0% draw, that's really hard
---
Download a app called meme generator.u will find it there
---
Yep, my brother found leon at 3k
---
I have lots of questions:
---
Do we use hand to draw or computer  
---
What if we can't find ink?  
---
what are we supposed to draw?  
---
Do we need to color it in?  
---
When do we start?

when does it end?

aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

really honestly every time I lie on sneaks up on me I usually kill it if I'm at full health

Happy cake day!

i mean thicc es but have seen zelda in botwb1
---
Then Sandy comes out and makes everyone invisible in his Sandstorm
---
"Ogoneck" it's a little fire(If translate from Russian), also "gin" is wrong writed "gene"
---
This is really good! Nice work.
---
Apparently adding zooms to a clip and generic sound effects as well as some edgy trap beat to some clips taken from reddit makes you a youtuber now
---
My guy
---
Wow. Gene has been working out... And used steroids, it seems.
---
This is how genetic operations work.
---
Can he pick a ball in Brawl Ball, while his super is active? If he can - 2nd SP would be OP.
---
I lost 69,420 brain cells reading this
---
Ryan's karma damn.
---
Ok I,ll try again and maybe post it.
---
I think u Will do good with mortis.
---
How do we draw trick? Anyways imma hop on this train. Melee will come tonight.
---
its not that bad lol, if you think this is bad you must have not played the game for that long
---
What a about a mythic brawler at 10k and a legendary St the end of trophy road.
---
what?
---
Maybe because he checked the brawler selection screen when sandy was still not unlocked.
---
brawler idea should atleast give an idea of what the attacks are etc...
---
pro gamer move.
---
Cute
---
Why do I think that I saw this b4
---
sandy is a boy they said.
---
HAPPY CAKE DAY  :D
---
This is epic
---
?
---
There is nothing wrong in this picture
---
Lmaooo underrated
---
Wish i chips upvote and downvote u at the same time , people paid excessive for that legendary brawler , so a loss for them , and that comp looks good
---
I'm F2P at 10000 whit leon only
---
If ur karma gets to negative u cant post anything in any sub
---
Tickette
---
no problem mate we still need it :)
---
You have to do this if you wanna win lmao. What I love about this game mode that everyone doesn’t know how to play it. Easy wins
---
You shoud check out my youtube channel [shootinclay](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzdJyW9mJhrKUu_Ffh3EVmQ) and see the date I uploaded the video relating to this post. you are not thinking this post is ahead of the video, are you?? At any rate, thank you for remembering this post:)
---
No news is good news
---
I have 700 trophies Brock, and that was very easy. I have 13000.
---
Yea self promoting, but the old post looked different
---
Shit
---
I got crow at 8500.
---
I think I saw this before.
---
I recommend going with the one you like to play the most. Everyone now has at least one good star. Barley would be my personal choice since he has two of the absolute best in my opinion.
---
"The work here is done,it nearly killed me" would have worked too :)
---
Ok,it's your opinion
---
Go for Darryl.
---
Thats not a strategy. Thats being an idiot. These kids, in this case probably you too, are literally chasing other brawlers and throwing their „charged“ super on them.
---
But nice try talking this good.
---
It really depends on how you perform with those brawlers, I suggest if you don't like a brawler/it's hard to push with it, max him so it's easier to push
---
Nah i’m just playin lol its fine. Nice artwork
---
Thanks
---
Yea you can use this clip! Just Credit it and we're fine.
---
Trophy road brawlers are the only exception because they didn’t exist back then. I’d also say yes, there is no attack like hers except Penny by a little bit. I don’t think her attack is very unique, at least to the other brawlers in the game.
---
True
---
If he actually credited the original poster then I won't have done that.
---
Mortis gang disapproves because:
---
1. It's no hat mortis
---
2. The art is stolen
---
can you zoom slightly more on the text because I think almost no-one will see it
---
Sure I'll shoot other brawler if he/she happens to be on the line of fire next to boss, or is having low hp near me. - But I don't chase them around the map, or camp to ambush them. For me it works quite well. At he beginning I rush to the boss as fast as I can, only collecting the few nearest power cubes. Many times I've landed dozens of hits (playing colt) to the boss while other brawlers are still walking around the map collecting power cubes or concentrated fighting with each others. It is also true that when those cube collectors finally arrive near the boss they usually kill me quite rapidly, but I've already nice lead at this point. I'don't mean that I allways win by playing like this, but usually I gain more trophies than I loose.
---
i searched it says its a iron cross of something Kingdom of Prussia , never heard this name ebefore
---
And the the primo do...
---
EEEELLL PRIMOOOOOOOO
---
I play Frank in Takedown and i am at 700, it doesn't matter that much what brawler you pick just that you are good with it
---
:D
---
The four horsemen of the apocalypse.
---
Just compensation the players the gems back equal to that of a mythic brawler lol

I feel you, bro

Coz SC loves you.

It’s probably not me but I did that like 2 months ago. I got the video, what’s your Brawl Stars name? Maybe it was me

Plot twist: He left to send you a friend request
---
This a repost u liar
---
Потому что ты Джин имба
---
hwo do you mkae thwt skul fly????
---
good boi
---
Low damage, average healt, without star power he's a bad healer, and you should see even some professional tier list of brawlers, poco is always one of the worst, with piper and shelly near, before the new star powers, now the game is different, but now that they nerfed all their star power they're again in the f/d tier
---
Ticcket
---
I got sandy but was complaining I didn’t get el primo
---
Agree, you need to describe the characters physical attributes.

---
&gt; doesn't change anything 
---
How sure are you about that? You may feel that, but across millions of games, a small change is a big change.
---
&gt; balancing in making a good trophy road 
---
Of course everyone wants more free stuff
---
&gt; if you nerf a brawler then buff it you can't still be balancing the game you should be fired 
---
That logic makes zero sense. You could nerf a certain aspect of a brawler and buff another. Indirect nerfs and buffs also have a huge impact. For example, you could nerf a brawler and keep it there for a few months, but after a few buffs to other brawlers, the brawler would be indirectly nerfed and nerfed to the ground like Pam.
---
Agreed!
---
Congratulations
---
Why didn’t you speak it in Gene language
---
That happened to me as Carl, and an El Primo took em, killed me and proceeded to spin.
---
500 is just a better number to look at rather than 550, a nice rounded number
---
The truth is finally revealed
---
All brawlers are actually of the same rarity
---
Ok ok shelly without super is useless ok playing her well helps
---
I agree cus that's my next reward
---
I was playing brawl stars in brawl ball back then in the 8-bit update then my game crashed in the middle of the match and i was so angry. When i came back the bot actually scored and it said that i scored. I was actually surprised.
---
Sometimes they do, e.g. a small username at the corner of the video, or links to that person's profile in the description. The problem is they never do state that the content was taken from where explicitly (they just put it there, you probably wouldn't notice if you don't check), and take the content without OP's permission.
---
This time to stop?
---
2/10  
---
\*Laughs in normal date conventions\*
---
Yeah basically her super is easy to charge and she has really long range
---
Repost
---
Do you speak english lmao
---
Nah i prefer a free legendary
---
better than a power 8 shelly
---
I got thicc
---
Sure Ryan-Senpai

Justin Bieber doesn't have cancer
---
Yeah you can do a challenge( and I ran out of things to put).
---
This is the 4th unit at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant
---
He got something called karma
---
hes one of the most consistent brawler
---
Tick for me is average. He is too annoying in long range because of his very spread attack, yet very squishy and very weak at close range. His super can save him in short range but most of the time it's a no no for him

For real? Probably a bunch of inactive or dead accounts. I wonder what the rate is among players who have played in the past week

You are doing ok 7-5
---
You need more stars/do more damage to boss 10-8
---
Really?
---
I'm 15,000 now

my man you can’t just downvote someone’s post, it’s their opinion on your overedited little pile of clips and they want to express their opinion

He wasn't. Not his. Check his other posts. You'll probably find the links to where he stole them.

Yeah right but getting at 5th place gives me no trophies so i didn't mentioned it

People accusing you of reposting other people's art. How about you prove its your artwork ??

Time to ship Piper × Mike

Nice one. Adobe ?

BB is how I dedicate most of my time in BS.

Oh god this going to get out of hand like the brawler fusions lmao
---
me: why didn't I think of that? exellent work tho.
---
This is good....
---
Maybe color it later on and repost?

Did you see what  he wrote as a comment in the crosspost? He threw a tantrum cuz his post is pretty low effort and quality

Maybe he used a number 1  for the sketch ?

I just reached 14k

Exactly. Brawlstars competitive is too serious. I like the discussion around the gameplay itself, but I also want to joke around with the community. If this subreddit were more like the Clash of Clans subreddit or the Clash Royale subreddit, it'd be ***MUCH*** better. Those two had good discussion plus quality memes about the community. Instead, we get absolute shit content here with little to no discussion.
---
Ngl, i thought this was a good ship so i started shipping it
---
Colt
---
Second one I agree.
---
First one is just too overused.
---
that is way different from orginal blind guy
---
Poco is a support brawler. His good healing makes up for his low damage, which is still consistent enough to weaken enemies enough for more offensive teammates to kill them.
---
u agressive blind
---
I'm a no-hat mortis main.
---
Or trying to score the ball in brawl ball and your teammate throws it back at you.
---
No, you darude man.
---
Honestly,
---
still better than people complaining about 2k players getting legendaries
---
Yeah but it’s almost a year. I’m not saying I’m unlucky I’m just saying a year without legendaries is normal
---
Shelly
---
they are using trophy inflations. accoding to game dev only 0.5% are 10k and above in april.
---
Barley is the most balanced brawler
---
No I don't think I will
---
So how does this work? 
---
First time seeing it today.
---
buttt.....
---
When i was on a trip i made a meme literally i d e n t i c a l to this. Noice
---
Thx man
---
Me too XD
---
Storm maze.
---
Then you are not a mortis main
---
When i got penny to level 9 i got her starpower immidietly Just after one minute (sry for my bad english)
---
still have 0 legs at 13k
---
Yes. Cuz bull is useless right now due to the existance of shelly. 
---
Bull bushcamping only works in &gt;400 trophies, where people facecheck bushes.
---
This guy dose not know how to pressure
---
ok
---
Make this the top post of all time in this subreddit
---
Who tf is posting a brawl stars meme in r/PewDiePieSubmissions?

HAVE AN UP VOTE AND A SHARE

I'm not english, I use the Google Translator xD

You're right but i think they will do it in time

Блин, они тебя не поймут, напиши это по английски, скопируй это и встать в гугл переводчик скопируй английский текст и встать, вот и все

Who TF knows who Aloona is in r/BrawlStars?

People stop posting about this it’s because matchmaking is based on the brawler trophies not the total trophies

Ohhhhhhh
---
Ette
---
Cool then
---
Btw how do you get the brawler icon next to your name?
---
Thanks.
---
Me too
---
They need to find a balance between getting all the Brawlers way too easily and making the people quit early (back in the old days I heard it was WAY too easy to get a legendary) and this... 11 k...only 21 Brawlers getting a legendary should be rewarding,But it shouldn’t take so long to get all the Brawlers
---
Might sound like I’m begging,but I’ve seen cases of this       
---
happening often... it shouldn’t take so long to get a character in a game (I’m cool with for example,A legendary every 1-2 months of game time)
---
Takedown is the easiest trophy pushing mode for ranged brawlers IMO. Just don't bother attacking other brawlers and you're good for 1-4th.
---
Nice
---
Let me check
---
For me it is the opposite.
---
Thx
---
my name is literally leon and i don't have him
---
thnx
---
Cyan hot
---
yeah my name is literally leon irl
---
I unlock leon today so I had do to this meme
---
Also I'm not f2p so that's an even bigger wtf from me
---
I join!
---
Spooky meme have my updoot
---
Touch your name and then choose "change the user flair"
---
I think you should specify how much damage It does
---
Can you confirm he isn't?
---
Your parents should of tought of that before naming you 🤷‍♂️

Turkey has the best bootleg stuff xD

Teaming with your teammates.
---
First of all, I'm not speaking english. Please exuse me If I wrote something wrong. I got Mortis and my friend wanted to play with mortis in my account. And I was IDIOT and I gave them to play with Mortis in my account. At the next week he said that he want my account. And he connect my account and I was angry and I request to supercell lock my account. And I banned. Please don't  repeat my mistake.
---
Yes! forgot that one
---
Just sort by top posts and you’ll find it
---
Bibi was average
---
Lmao
---
You're really proud of this, even though it's wrong.
---
I am Crow and literally i am a Crow
---
I had an ally in-game called Gene and he was running Dynamike.
---
Old tara
---
Saving up at least a little bit is better imo, not in terms of luck or rewards but better in the feeling of it. Now I'm only saving for new brawlers. But when I still needed to unlock a bunch I would save up about at least a few days worth. Opening one just isn't very fun.
---
Wait is Rosa really red
---
Yah, it’s sad, 14.5K is just all 500s
---
Imagine getting nothing at 16k😂
---
Bay bay
---
He finally realised the truth
---
Yep we will see how they will nerf again poco making him a useless brawler
---
Wow cool!!!
---
At least it's not heist 2
---
Nice drawing!!
---
at this point they wouldnt nerf him anymore otherwise Poco Gang would go rampage
---
I would like to start a petition to rename the crow gang the murder gang. Or simply "Murder"
---
Same bro 16k gang wya
---
I was in a match the other day and the exact same thing happened
---
MORTIS GANG FOR EVER
---
OK. I'm sorry
---
When did you start playing and what s your chances to unlock a legendary brawlers?
---
Saving boxes does nothing to improve your drop chances. If anything it hurts them, since SC clearly state in the box info that each box opened that doesn’t give you a brawler improves your luck value. 
---
What people should do is literally the opposite of what you said.
---
Yeah
---
2012 memes be like
---
All Poco in this subreddit. That really cool
---
The 20 january we will raid supercell offices, they can't nerf all us
---
I can do that even with 1 powercube shelly
---
idk if you are being sarcastic
---
I've seen Phoenix Crow go lower than 219, but I wouldn't hold my breath
---
4 less brawlers makes it that much easier to max everyone else 5,700 less points to get.
---
Someone else made a meme like that
---
If it really happens there would be only a few guys like the area 51 one
---
thought it would hurt as much as crow.
---
Yeah Mortis need buff but Crow s both star powers are trash.
---
Youre about... 3 years too late
---
Mortis doesn't need faster reload speed, he needs a bit more HP
---
Should have used a colt bullette
---
Not to us, but to 99% of players it is
---
The “I wanted Rico but I got some *insert bad legendary description* joke”
---
Oh, well Spike can make lots of damage upclose, I think he might be quite OP
---
well, r/takedownsupercell exists soo
---
I was talking of what dumb was the Bull, not what skilled i was
---
Pizza time all italiana
---
Lol i really checked the sub, it doesn't exists
---
GG
---
Haha I made a post and a person said that i didnt belong in Leon Gang but he didnt have Leon :}
---
Happy Happy Darryls Day
---
For anyone wondering, Kairos in the last video said that mortis Is not good in brawl ball
---
there was one, but its now gone, it was for demands like old rico or buff mortis or crow, but other than that it was stupid
---
Don't play it. That's what I do and it works for me 😊
---
Slice and dice is pizza time
---
Have u ever pushed him over 700 reloading showel takes ages.. it's too dumb that a showel takes this much time they nerfed his SP to 3.5secs as well it's annoying
---
I think that today marks the day that good daily things can be seen every 24 hours.
---
That's hot
---
Oohh thank you :)
---
No. I would say get better in the game. She's not OP. After the Band-Aid nerf she is in the low tier again. I'm always reliefed when I face her outside of Showdown.
---
Going out with style
---
Alt account?
---
I enjoy watching small animals fight one another.
---
90% of the time it's not a choice, if you're name is offensive they will change it to either Crow, Leon, Spike or Bot 1, Bot 2 etc...
---
Where’s primo?
---
Perfectly balanced as all things should be
---
son
---
Ok I will upvote your post pls don’t hurt me mr Darryl man
---
I think Leon would be a bully, because he can do a lot of pranks with his super and surikens
---
You forgot the bush!
---
Skins in Apex legends cost less
---
You’ll be paying these people no mind and they just shoot at you, then I’m like well looks like ima have to kill you now
---
It looks very nice exept maybe for the walls and bushes on the side, there is no much space to interract with other brawler. But keep the good work
---
Yay not even jk I have 141001 trophies 
---
Dead ass
---
hahaha, luckily I've been able to spike at 8200 trophy
---
Calm down, Gedi-kor.

---
**El Primo:** Back to back heavyweight wrestling champion.
---
**Rosa:** Proves that vegans can be boxers too.
---
**Bibi:** She's a troublemaker, but an *athletic* troublemaker. Don't mess with her when she's on a baseball diamond.

---
**Carl:** Valedictorian in the running

---
Well, it could be
---
Cool
---
I’m new to reddit is cake day when you just start reddit or your birthday
---
They are turkish words
---
Can means health
---
Atak means attack
---
She's not meta in the 600-750 range (not sure about higher) because  Rosa is a pretty boring brawler, easy wins though if used right. Her super nerfs may be a factor to her not being meta
---
Oh thanks. I don’t know Turkish, so Two more things I know I gues
---
I want to. abnormalities
---
This is when Supercell took her school picture.
---
Leon strikes me as the type of guy who would do pranks, but not towards students. Towards staff instead.
---
1000/10
---
oke
---
I reallly don’t want to admit how long I’d been playing before I realized his name is Rico because he ricochets bullets...😩😒🤨
---
Is it just me or did you made the tier by seeing who has the most members?
---
Really like the style, looking forward to next part
---
The punching champs
---
I also shot my arrows elsewhere to make him think I gave up lol
---
That would be lucky, but once I killed someone and destroyed the enemy safe with one charge
---
H

Why is the volume covering the image 😂

Because that’s what heroes do!

Can someone explain the purpose of savong boxes if you’re not maxed?

I was looking for a spike Picture btw to make a skin and I found this
---
Sjahdnabdjad gordugumde bune lan dedim cidden
---
And just like that, they've got 170 updoots
---
What if I told you I know a girl named Pamella, that registered as Pam in game without knowing there was a brawler with this name and now mains Pam? lol
---
I prefer this format
---
you have no legs??
---
must be hard to walk
---
Not maxed gang
---
Mortis actually dashed through the ball
---
This happened like 2 weeks after her remodel
---
Wtfetteette
---
What box
---
i support this idea,if Supercell did this it be like the robo spike,robo mike,mecha crow and mecha bo trailer,IT WOULD BE AWESOME
---
really?  i only noticed now
---
800 Mortis. You should not play Mortis in BB. There are always better options
---
Thats what I was thinking. Great minds think alike.
---
👏 Seriously 👏
---
Friendly reminder that YOU NEED MORE STARS
---
Thanks Bro
---
Please tell me this is a joke
---
what do you guys think
---
In Spanish is not a weird name, neither in English.
---
huh what is funny
---
Lone stat is cool but it have some really shity maps like island invasion.
---
It’s not yours
---
Since Leon is a Croatian name, Leon is Croatian.
---
I made

It literally has someone else’s name in the picture

It’s not fake bro, I was actually gonna quit and I got Leon.

Yep, my first name is Leon and my last name is Irl
---
I’m saying that I’m not quitting now because I got the legendary.
---
Imagine  getting first place. Oh wait, you can’t. Dirty mosquito scum
---
Yeah ;)
---
Looks like an r/imsorryjon type post

He got this from someone it’s not urs
---
Brasil
---
I get 1st a lot more than 2nd or 3rd
---
darrrrryylllllll
---
I was thinking "yeah, you're right, Shelly's just OP" up til the end there, but that was some excellent juking. Poor Bo!
---
It’s a luck drop. Someone could get a legendary at 100 trophies and another person could be at 14000 and not have one. Your chances of getting a legendary go up as you open more boxes
---
Nice playing! One second is still a lot of time
---
Usually its the other way around with me lmao (im a crow and mortis main)
---
False Darrly dosent speak
---
*people with all the legendarys laughing on the distance*
---
lol just responds with “mhm”.
---
Big shoutout to Poppi &amp; Fingolfin 👌👌
---
Got 1 starpower from boxes, buy the 3 others, I only max out the brawlers I enjoy playing with
---
I swear sometimes i just kill the crow early on just so that i won't have to face him later on
---
It will come sonner or later!
---
Does anyone actually like takedown AND lone star? People seem to only likw one of the other, and they hate it's counterpart
---
Yea. So u gain +4 for first, +2 for second, and 0 for third if you are at 1200+ trophies. Its all downhill from 3rd.
---
Try doing cleaner lineart and make the skirt longer
---
Agreed
---
*If you try to scream I will* ***KILL YOU EVEN MORE.***
---
Hey, winning’s winning.
---
He also has crow yesterday
---
aww man
---
What balance
---
I had an account do this but with Barley.
---
bitch
---
Lone star yes but I’m nasty at takedown
---
Flair checks out
---
THANK YOU SO MUCH ;;  
---
I don't post much stuff on reddit exactly because this shit always happens! I'm really thankful for you looking out for these stealers.
---
He’s a gemmer, bud.
---
&gt; you have more trophies you’ve probably opened more boxes as you’ve played more and got more tokens so uhh
---
Very flawed. You can only get a maximum of 2 boxes per day (4 with token doublers) and a bigger box per 2 days. 
---
If you play more, you don't necessarily open more boxes. You can't infinitely grind them.
---
If you got your 200 tokens for the day, and keep on playing... Yes, you will get trophies. No, you won't get more boxes.
---
how is this cursed? the image is too vague
---
Oopsie
---
Damn, that’s a cool map!
---
I just find shooting a robot so boring

Thank you ;\_;;
---
Not funny didn’t laugh
---
Please delete this post. I'll have to report you otherwise.
---
I find it to be one of my favorite modes rn to be honest
---
It’s fun to be competing against the others
---
Flair does not check out.
---
I have a 0.146 legendary chance with 0 legendaries. I’ve only missed about 5 days worth of tokens since global release, so it’s not due to missing boxes for me.
---
Your chance can also go down due to pulling mythics, so I think a lot of the time it just comes down to bad luck as far as the timing of that too. You can pull a mythic just as your legendary chance gets high
---
That’s a bug.
---
Anytime!! You’re my favorite artist, and I definitely wouldn’t let this go unnoticed. I know a lot of posts get stolen on Reddit, and I completely understand why you don’t post so much on here anymore. I try to stop as many art thieves as I can, sadly there’s too many of them. I hope you’re doing well, and I hope that none of your art gets stolen again shsgshsbs.
---
Niceeeee
