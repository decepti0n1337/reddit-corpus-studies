Ahh, makes sense. I was thinking the season reset would be similar to other games such as fortnite. All new rewards, trophies reset, etc.

No :(

how does he eat the cereal tho? does he just smile at it till it disappears? also amazing art!

So they were in the game too?

More like actually decent random teammates

That's fine, and I have no jealousy for these people whether or not they can afford it, I choose to spend my money on other things, but if I got addicted I'd hope someone would shame me, especially when I was the person wasting money on a mobile game

So good your head will come off!

Yes I know but let's be real.If it there was none of the guys like him or guys who spend some money on the game.Do you think that the game would exist or even if it exsisted that it would be free and ad free?

Almost 12k. My first legendary was Leon, I was almost at 3k back than, and my second legendary was Spike whom I just bought (when robo Spike was released)

Yes because these games are fun and make people want to spend the money to be better. Look up video gaming whales on youtube. This person is a good example and should not be supported and this post was there to shame these people. Shame is a very strong thing and will hopefully prevent others from doing the same. I've spent money on the game to, I think you should support, not be a whale

No problem I understand you I would have acted the same

Te help out, enter your credit card number, the expiration month and year, and the 3 digits on the back.

Rewards are always the same but there is trophy reset for brawlers over 550 trophies.It's simple really but there is too much of it too write you can find how it works on youtube probably.üòÇ

this just makes me want brawl stars on the switch even more- and i don't even have a switch

but imagine if they made that a switch exclusive free skin or somethin (only people who have a switch can get it) that'd honestly be pretty cool

Also humour is subjective.  Something that only few people find funny is better than no humour at all

Ha not replying? Ur just scared. Also if you really wanna argues if I copied ur opinion, is not my problem and it has 100% to do with ur IQ. Ur saying that you can attack players to charge supers and I said most of the time is not worth the time ur spending on other players, dummy. How is that a flip? Idiot.

What did you do exactly? Looks like nothing happening

Yes your editing skills are so good that people mistake it do the real thing

The wierd part is that if you manage to get over 20K damage each kill will make a random sound from any ability (shield, invisibility) or crash your game or heal the enemy then kills them

If it was a whoooosh, the flair would be humor. And it isn't funny anyways. I'm 13, and I don't even find it funny

I said woosh because it‚Äôs a bait. He purposely made a shitty meme to get peoples triggered reaction in the comments section. It‚Äôs a joke
---
not gonna lie it will be interesting
---
Yes IS THE SEX PENIS
---
Its a bug
---
#*^B*
---
But what about mortis vs rico with robo retreat?
---
Fu** took me 39 mins to read
---
exactly! thats the reason why brawlers like primo pr darryl are very strong against her (once they get their super) because they have much hp and can ger close to her very easy (especially darryl).
---
it says super rare on the top left corner
---
eventually you can play 3vs3 or duos with friend who knows how not to rush with 10 gems or with low hp or with high bounty etc
---
Your name is phaserknight
---
Yeah right. You just made an account and went to r/brawlstars to comment
---
This is at the level of "all your bases are belong to ya"
---
Another thing i do sometimes is go invisible while outside a bush in full view of them then just stand still. And they will freak out for a while. Of course that means you waste your super but still the reaction is worth it
---
And Piper can be good on overtime when bushes and walls disappear, Dyna is bad anyway too
---
 Iam German and you? My english is not really better
---
Nope, it only heals 450hp and she losses about 85 every second, she is a bad choice.
---
Max tickets is a bad idea because it's a way to massive risk, if the players you end up with are trash then you wasted all your tickets
---
Final shot is also a bad idea because you don't do shit for the whole match and just wait until that final shot. Extra experience based on damage dealt to the boss is a beter idea, this way you actually have to participate in the match rather than just wait for the opportunity for the final shot
---
Overtime won‚Äôt happen if the team w piper gets rushed...
---
Yes, my device also happen this
---
F
---
This guy get it
---
But if the allies are good yes
---
‚ÄúEvery other game...‚Äù Literally no competitive or semi-competitive game has a system where a player doesn‚Äôt get penalized for losing or playing poorly... and if there is, it‚Äôs probably a bad game. A simple ban system would suffice. For 3v3‚Äôs, a detection system where if a person hasn‚Äôt hit an opponent in a match, stands in the same area for too long, or leaves a match multiple games in a row, the player would be warned. After 2-3 warnings, the player should be investigated by Supercell to see if they truly were throwing.
---
this is too cool to be implemented
---
Nothing changed actually...

We need to buff leon, crow is almost 2 times stronger, leon was the rarest, its not fair, he needs some buffs to be as good as crow.

Hate me. Mine is 0% since I found them all for free

I am from Spain :   "mata" is refered to the last shoot of a joint and "el rigio" is a name like El primo, then, he is saying that "el rigio mata", "El Rigio kills the joint"

I noticed that many spanish players are using those names, Manuel mata, el chulo mata, david mata, etc....

2. Darryl super with all ammo filled, so ammo is useless.

3. Darryl does so much damage, he can 3 shot every brawler in the game with any star power if he's close enough.

How can no one understand how matchmaking works wtf??? You even have an in game tip on how it works.... Matchmaking is based on trophies of the brawler you are playing as so you can have a power 1 brawler with 600 cups matched against a power 10 brawler with 600 cups....

discounts don't make a skin good. i never liked rockabilly mortis so i won't buy it even if it was 15 gems. it's fine to sometimes ask opinion on skins , they can be tough to choose from. for ex. the current  witch shelly vs werewolf leon. both are cool but some people only have 150 gems so they ask for help.

---
K. Thank you.
---
L. Snady does really good damage, and paired with invisibility, he is deadly. He needs to do slightly less damage, but a small health buff in return to not make him too weak.
---
M. The buffs are in 2 parts. One part is buffing one so it's equally as good as the other, balanced one. Another part is buffing both because they are both shite. Barley has both amazing star powers, so both should be nerfed. While Pam has both of them being horrible, and I shouldn't nerf 20+ star powers instead if buffing 2. If you're interseted in the sort of physicology behind why games have more buffs than nerfs, then check out https://youtu.be/bsC8io4w1sY

I'm happy you showed me some third party point of view, and I hope I've made you change your mind on a few of them.
---
Really? It wasn't like I was being sarcastic or anything like that.
---
This is awesome! I love the way you draw. I‚Äôm a beginner artist so while I don‚Äôt have many tips, I can say that you should just keep going and you‚Äôll improve! I love your style so much and I can‚Äôt wait to see more of your art.
---
Not really
---
Dynamite!

Yeah, using an underleveled brawler is likely to give you a bad time. Specifically 8-Bit more than anyone else? I don‚Äôt know that that‚Äôs because of your level - I think you just struggle against 8-Bit with Extra Life, which is probably because of the brawler you‚Äôre playing. In Showdown I tend more towards long-range brawlers rather than throwers or heavies, and maybe 8-Bit‚Äôs Extra Life has a bigger impact on those brawler types?
---
Its a group tomb
---
y
---
8-Bit extra life is trash
---
I'm on a galaxy s9 plus with no problems
---
Haha true
---
&gt;Children shouldn't be playing brawl stars in schopl anyway
---
Lunch time is a thimg. Im some schools recess is also a thing. Some schools give kids breaks so that could be time spent playing
---
r/lazyupvote
---
Yup it is reposted
---
Oh xD
---
I‚Äôm using a power 1 tick rank 19 his range is decent but extra life makes the 8bit kill me after respawning with one barrage of bullets
---
I prefer the water shooting Jessie tho.
---
Racism?
---
Portuguese is definitely not Spanish, especially the Brazilian whys._.
---
Cute

Accurate. But token doublers and event tickets &gt; skins. And with star points, boxes &gt; skins if you‚Äôre not maxed.
---
*I was playing Penny in big game and bet 10 tickets

*jessie is big boss*

And we beated her in 1:26

When it came up for me it said ‚Äúbrawl talk tomorrow‚Äù so Supercell had better give us a brawl talk today and another update within a week or that‚Äôs false advertising.

THIS POPPED OUT IN MID OF MY SHOWDOWN AND I GOT 10TH PLACE. I HAD 983 TROPHIIIEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
---
That doesn‚Äôt really fit the definition of a joke Shakespeare.
---
I bought mine for 69 and it was a nice price
---
It dosent help that ur trying to be all smart about peanut
---
Actually kinda hope this gets added
---
The post is he MAXED HIS ACCOUNT BY PAYING FOR IT. You brought up your friend as an example so I used myself for an example saying in 1 year I will too have a maxed account. I got the game about a month after android release and also had a month or so time span where I stopped playing early on. My point is, even with an extra 2 months, this person was clearly paying to get the best brawlers and was still trash. I was a level 2 EMZ vs his lvl 10 and beat him so I was shaming him initially for being a pay to win.
---
Then you said its possible to have all maxed brawlers being F2P.
---
IT IS INDEED POSSIBLE TO MAX AN ACCOUNT BEING F2P, BUT THOSE PEOPLE HAVE HIGH TROPHY COUNTS. not 12k trophies like this clear P2W player was.
---
Like jeesh
---
Why did you post this twice?
---
Dude maybe he didnt push trophies

Frickin' amazing! I hope I see you in hot!

Fun fact, Caesar was srill barwly alive, and was about to come out from under the slab, but JoJo finished him off by pounding the stone with his fists
---
Sure ill think about it
---
What i like here is Mortis's shovel,so we can say he killed this dynamike.
---
I need sandy crow and spike i have leon with both star powers
---
Isn't nita like native american?
---
You dont push trophies... you win games and get points and just naturally get higher trophies to get more brawl boxes. 
---
EITHER WAY theres not a single possible way he could be F2P with all maxed brawlers at this stage of the game. 
---
I dont know why you're arguing you havent shown any evidence to prove a F2P can have all maxed brawlers, because it's not possible. Hes clearly P2W
---
He's spending money on the game. And others like him are also spending money. It's because of players like him that the game is f2p. It's really not a hard statement to understand.
---
Thank you!

How were u able to play power play?

I'm seeing this in different ways üòè

So true this shit is evil but smart
---
Excuse me how do you expect me to show proof when im a 10k player with people on my friends list at my level. And you havent shown proof of p2w either, just a profile of unknown age
---
I knew they were gonna release amazing skins so I saved my gems and now I have 227 gems and I can buy both werewolf Leon and Calavera piper, Idk If I wanna buy Calavera piper tbh, should I save the gems?
---
The opponent should of read the soul to prevent dying from dyna's super....
---
NO! NO! NO! NO!

---
After Leon got his voice I hope that Darryl doesn't get a voice.
---
Nice. Hopefully SC sees this post and adds some kinda features as suggested into the game in the future.
---
It wasn't unexpected he commented on a Jojo meme
---
Ooo there are right showdown maps for mortis. As long as don't play erratic blocks its fine
---
But I don't have a legendary on my brawl stars account
---
It happened with Shark Leon right?
---
How did u how???
---
Did you made it?
---
I hope u did, one barley main to another
---
Icy Emz sounds cool! She could spray little snowflakes.
---
Shhh
---
it might sound funny, but I kinda wish I never found Leon
---
Finding Leon and Crow in one week resulted in massive luck drop and not finding anything since June. I'm at 9k with no mythics, two epics and those two legendaries... but I'd gladly trade Crow for mortis
---
These are brawl stars "hero" packs. They have a figure of a brawler and three playable cards
---
Same but with kairos time. I‚Äôve won like 8 games but can‚Äôt see myself on the leaderboards.
---
I knew it was gonna be a clean sweep considering how many people play Brawl (and probably how thousands of people joined each team) but holy hell I didn‚Äôt realize how it would look
---
This is unprecedented

Y

I bought it for 150, and still worth it

buy it its dope i will buy it too
---
Give us proof because it showing you at 14869 in the image. Until then downvote
---
This is good
---
Me too but half of my brain says yes to add a voice to Darryl
---
But if they add a worst voice?
---
Why? Diamonds aren‚Äôt typically black.
---
Alright, buster, you're under arrest!
---
Thx I tried
---
guys,
---
That‚Äôs just what it looks like bud
---
uh, no?
---
Looks like the brawlers in the middle's collor are a mix of the ones at the sides. For both teams.
---
when dj frank's deal is over.
---
Dynamike!
---
Imagine not cutting your video properly
---
I ment that it shows this on the trophy line not the number
---
Why downvote for showing a bug
---
Congrats
---
:)
---
Did he come out yet tho? I have every available skin but hes still not popping up?
---
Oh sorry but most of them steal posts and art from this sub.
---
Does anyone know why the profile and trophy road are now in seperate boxes?
---
I actually get spike üòÜüòÜ
---
hmm

You cant now it over, you can only watch sorry
---
Hi Brian!
---
Wow thanks :)
---
Eu n√£o falo ingl√™s ,desculpe.
---
It's cool if they add a star skin for every brawler
---
The tr road stops there ! Gg
---
And I struggle to make simple logos...
---
Wait is WW leon limited edition?
---
Nice work
---
These are good but I think Leon's one should be: Unseeable
---
What would you change it to? Otherwise I was thinking about a trophy road reward...
---
Is Lwarb
---
Spent 100 Tickets in Big Game 3 out of 5 I was Jessies as Big Brawler... She's honestly the worst to face but the easiest to gain time with

How could he spin or deal DMG when he would throw his pickaxe away?
---
The name is great UPVOTE!!
---
Well, I got Leon in June and even since then I don't get any new legendaries. Leon is only the legendary brawler I have. I would say getting 2 legendaries is much cooler than getting mythics, crow and spike are so broken now...
---
Mortis is fun, but he's weak. Usually only works for gem grab and showdown
---

Oof

Hoi

The plots are breakable when you attack them with a simple attack.

Hmm, *is nice.*

I'm at 13.5k trophies and I don't have gene yet rip

nope, i do something called "turn notifications off'

Me: "gigles"

Also me :i have 3 legendaries and no mythics
---
Thanks although I‚Äôm not sure if many other seems to feel the same way
---
The world record is 22 seconds

I just play once to get the star token. That's it. Game mode with the worst rewards
---
Wait these exist where do you get them XD
---
Of course you can
---
thanks it really fits with the map :D
---
Finally something good
---
Or you can just slip in and sleep with them
---
You know
---
There wasn‚Äôt 5 people in one team?
---
I'll use it on my cake day
---
Caps On All Words feels satisfying 
---
But English teachers will be triggered
---
but 1-2 weeks after they are on discount so
---
Well (if your idea was really) i think the legendary should be at 14500 because its gonna be esay for you to get a free legendary
---
And actually this idea would break the system how the game is supossed to work by giving a free lenegdary
---
It feels satisfying to see all words capped maybe im just weird
---
Ok sorry it just gets annoying when your friend who started after you and has less trophies than you has every brawler in the game except for 8 bit and Emz while you are yet to get a mythic or legendary
---
It's too cute to shake on this
---
Yeah. Maybe we should just turn them off for our sanity
---
How do you make apps? Am I just a noob with an android who doesn't have the app?

Do you have star shelly?

r/usernamecheckout
---
I see photoshop filter usage
---
They don't improve by boxes, only when you get all the brawlers of a rarity
---
Yeah, but the problem is that I am not finding them and I am playing since the android beta (taking breaks of the game). Even I get one of them from a box when I had 1100 trophies
---
They most definitely bought them.
---
good point, I'd probably remove the free legendary
---
I never understood rock paper scissors in these cheap cards why not just use your hands?
---
Also me: has all 3 mythics but no Frank
---
Lmao
---
I had a friend at like 400 trophys and next day he said "I've opened a box and I got this black bird". My friends and I were at like 1000-2500 trophys and laughing in disbelief but it was real and we were just like *wtf*.
---
I got Leon on like 3000-4000 trophys and Spike at 6700-7000 trophys.
---
One of my friends had 10.000 trophys and has no legendarys while another friend of mine had around 8000+ trophys a few weeks ago and got Tara and Leon in the same fucking day.

yeah I thought that too until I found out he's F2P
---
Yeah and a mythic if its overpowered
---
nice subtle advertising
---
Oh i saw like more than 3 respawn bubbles

Maybe

No, it's just a delay (or a bug)

Oh god the 1 tile gaps and this would just be thrower party
---
Bruh.. opposite for me. I spent all my gems two weeks ago and usually I don't mind skins at all and I don't have Leon too but for some reason, I really loved Witch Shelly, such a good skin but it is limited so there's only little time so I'm bummed by that.

by the way it will take decades for these trees to grow, so keep those emissions low ok?

To fix this problem, the ball should just bounce off the goal if a teammate hoots it in there.
---
Actually I already saw ur posts and upvoted it, but since I saw ur so desperate for karma so u advertise yourself in random posts (ur idea is useful to know which friend to invite to which mode, if u don't have good friends or don't have friends at all then it's useless, it won't give u an option so u play less with randoms) so I downvoted
---
panda nota and caveman frank are cool tho :-(
---
but yeah white crow is a steal

* yt event starts *

Everyone in KT team: so anyways i started winning

I gave you 1 energy drink.

Do you like hay day? Boom beach? Clash of Clans?

Cat must've felt good
---
Didn't know that. Thanks!
---
Me who just posted someting familiar to this and got 6 upvotes
---
ight, imma head out
---
Turned it off first time I got them, annoying as hell
---
_happiness noise_
---
Just why? You honestly think this is funny?
---
You Don't Have To Capitalize Each Word In A Sentence You Know. And If Anyone Is Toxic Here It's You Because This Is The Prime Example Of Why This Subreddit Is Bad. And If You Actually Think The Number 69 Is Funny Then You Are Retarded.
---
I really butchered your entire post when reading it lmao. I'd have to disagree. You're just playing with people who don't know how to play throwers properly lol. Two throwers on the same team are one of the most toxic things that can happen because the third player no matter what it is can play with essentially a damage shield around him. Throwers can easily kill if you don't choke your shots and they have great objective damage and area control. Sure pushing isn't one of their best qualities but defending against pushes is something they succeed in.
---
Well they are different brawlers so its not the games fault its the players fault
---
That‚Äôs the equivalent of a mega box! :O
---
Shut up kid. No one has done that.
---
Noice
---
But there‚Äôs no one spinning
---
Idk what the fudge that is
---
How
---
The sad part is that it is never garenteed
---
so the attack is like bo but tripled :)
---
lol, people with 10k are downvoting me because they don‚Äôt know that is better to have an big super range and waiting 5 seconds to respawn than reviving instantly once per game and no ammo üòÇ
---
Mortis broken
---
Thanks for the upvotes guys
---
Thank you so much
---
Nah its only been like what 4 or 3 days they reworked it
---
If spike gets voicelines probably should be like some wind sounds that passed in it mouth/eyes
---
Hahaha what a good joke. I will never get spike no matter how many boxes I open. 
---
12k and no legendaries
---
He killed himself right after killing the last Crow
---
Lol i was almost a OG but I missed this? Crap
---
This will make pam more usable
---
Looks great! The only problem that I have with it is the font (they use nougat extra black in their logo).
---
Crow after balance changes
---
Well, it's just luck since I've had free to play accounts that get legendaries in mear days. Unfortunately my main doesn't have a legendary
---
Replace her with Piper
---
This  f2p thing is dumb as hell. I didn't spend a cent until a couple months ago and had all the current brawlers back then. It's all about luck
---
Yeah bro same I was gonna leave but editing is hard so here you go, take my upvote
---
WOW BEST PLAY EVERRRRRRR /s
---
Nice.

12 December to 5-4 days next

or people at 100 trophies
---
WhEre‚ÄôS mY hYdRoFlAsK???
---
Me with my 0,2945 chance who has never gotten an legendary at 13,5k: Pathetic
---
Instead of the butterfly, I thought you wrote bob and I was gonna ask ‚Äúwho‚Äôs bob?‚Äù XD
---
its normal
---
I bet they'll steal this too
---
People dont remember i guess
---
Never spend 20 tickets on big game. Youll get more tokens from boss fight or robo rumble.
---
Interesting...
---
I got him a 12k
---
Nicely done!
---
People are so greedy these days. Instead of coming with ideas to improve matchmaking and the brawlers play style, you just add more tokens.
---
I got an idea for el primo's 3rd star power: Poder Jalape√±o: el primo gets a punch bar! When the punch bar is full, el primo will turn red with firey trails behind him, gets a long range and dashes with his fist. However the bar will take a LONG time to activate.
---
how do they choose the winners tho
---
I‚Äôm saying baseline, 2 throwers is the worst pairing in the game. I can‚Äôt think of any other pairing that‚Äôs worse than 2 throwers
---
I thought my case was sad...
---
New Leon voicelines are meme sources
---
Then you wake up

I know how you feel

She kinda looks like Vanessa from Black clover
---
Lmao this is so true coming from a p2w like me
---
the joke here is very good
---
/s
---
Its worse to have Leon as a f2p and not being able to get the skin
---
And the reverse card shows... u/JAG_BS. Hm, what a coincidence.
---
Her legs ...
---
Truth
---
I bet this wasn't a custom game
---
I bet the shelly won lmao
---
Crow remodel leaked *not clickbait*  *must watch*  *at 3am*  *gone s#xual*  *joe fainted*
---
Your post has been removed, make sure to use the body of a post to elaborate on the title.
---
She looks smart.
---
Not gonna lie, it took me a second
---
Nice! My record is 6
---
i dont judge it was intresting and i liked it
---
Good map!
---
I don‚Äôt think so
---
Because it looked bad

---
Sure wasn‚Äôt! It said +10 trophies at the end :)
---
i know but it kinda turns into 80 gems
---
such a creative name
---
Huh...? 0_0
---
True I didn't see that first time good job
---
Wow just copy me, that‚Äôs nice
---
For me OP means "overpowered" but okay
---
and OF COURSE you where playing Piper
---
Haha,  Yeah.
---
*cries in 23 Brawlers at 12K Trophies*
---
true
---
Probably a few stars above ya
---
You actually have a better chance to get a legendary with more boxes
---
Lmao he aint good in takedown nor graveyard shift. Hes good but not top tier in duo showdown
---
And she has shocky.
---
I actually got BiBi from opening the boxes I saved from robo rumble that were meant for Emz
---
it... didnt??
---
The chance to get a legendary is the same with every chest. So you have 10 chests compared to 1 chest so your chance is higher
---
Mr Bat is happy because he gets into spaces he cant fit in
---
How to save post
---
Wow...You actually made the whole song
---
Why
---
Or you played as 8 bit with 1 up and committed suicide
---
United states of SMASH!
---
Usually the definition of an assassin is someone who attacks and kills with the enemy being unable to attack back. Mortis and Leon use speed and kills as fast as possible. It is next to impossible to hit a crow that is attacking you.
---
No im pretty sure the megabox is Your % x 10
---
Yes.
---
I buy her for 69 gems but yes
---
I never did it for the karma or for the art work. I found it on google.
---
And for having purple hair lol.
---
oh damn thats what I forgot

I thought it was random
---
Ah yes bono
---
sorry new phone who dis
---
What about the fact that i never face a lag? even if i live in south east asia (location with worst server, confirmed by Frank) If you use a shitty connection, don't expect to play smoothly
---
Where do you find the leaderboard?
---
But Leon is kinda garbage...
---
I also miss it

Im shak-

So no head?

have some random tree stumps to mess with that ;) also they aren't many Piper Gem Grabs right now so this could be a change.

After all this map is pretty good for throwers as support, so why not?
