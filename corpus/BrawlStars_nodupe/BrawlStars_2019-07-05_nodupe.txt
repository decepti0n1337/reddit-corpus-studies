Huh?

Idk

Do crow plz

üòÇüòÇüòÇ not at all

Everyone loves surprises
---
For one, although you can‚Äôt buy them as a minor, you can buy guns at Walmart. Some of them are also pretty cheap. You can get a handgun for like $40, so they‚Äôre really not that expensive. Just because it‚Äôs not the easiest thing, compared to other countries, buying and owning guns in America is a much easier thing to do.
---
Look at you 2 love birds hitting it off
---
Yum yum üòã Jessie‚Äôs feet ü¶∂üèøin my mout ü§§ü§§ü§§
---
I thought the shark ate him lmao
---
Fuck this is good.
---
Mortis getting new healing abilities
---
There‚Äôs a latency since they introduced the trophy change, wait 2-3 weeks and a lot of people will reach 500 making it easier for you
---
Who's star power did you swap?
---
Those are some exceptional analytic skills
---
It is a good idea but I feel it would be better if it was non stop waves of boss after boss and each one got harder to beat and the last team to live wins because yours is good but it will just be a bunch of dps brawlers
---
I love it, keep up the good work. (I may have seen the rico one yesterday on sorting by new)
---
This make me laugh everytime:D
---
and you can't convince us that you are better than a random.
---
Don't team you deserved to get back stabbed
---
False equivalence
---
I believe 200 is the max friends you can have for your friends list
---
I didn't notice it until I saw the comment
---
you were a bad boyüòÇ
---
donghoon you never cease to amaze me
---
I didn't knew it was a robot my life is a lie
---
Ye
---
Yes, it upset me a bit. Because I did a hard work and spend much time to achieve 500 for some of my Brawlers. And now it seems like 700 is the new 500. It's just like they lower my trophies to 300 for those Brawlers..
---

---
But yeah, I'll get over this.
---
Played since beta came to Android  and have stayed in rank 19 poco
---
??
---
He did
---
CARLITOS??????
---
I FREAKEN LOVE THIS!!!!
---
This format was made by that person but the meme itself is original, I checked that person‚Äôs profile.
---
Oof
---
What did it say the post was deleted
---
Template was drawn by u/jinxthewitch
---
[removed]
---
I don‚Äôt agree with this at all, on top of this map he also stole 7 other of my maps, as well as some from a few others I know, although this was the only one added. I also put the dates to show mine was made in February and his was in June, so I‚Äôm not the copycat here. The devs and Rey were already informed via Twitter, but I decided to share it here as well to spread the word more.
---
Where?
---
Here
---
dying is my game*
---
Thanks!
---
I would cry myself to sleep at this point in life
---
#YES
---
NOW 
---
I NEEEEEEEEEEEEEED IT
---
Lol oof
---
Ikr i dont know why he felt the need to post this just post the screenshot of his win
---
No didn‚Äôt he bang Nita
---
Hey there... Thank you so much for using this template and ACTUALLY putting in effort into it!
---
Life's tuff
---
I use Pixel lab....
---
i donT SEe iT
---
ƒ∞ got crow in 600 trph
---
Mr Bat says hi
---
Hey there..  thanks for using it! And Kirin is a good friend of mine.. I'll tell her about this
---
Is that pewds merch?
---
It's simple. Take your time.. I practiced a shading technique while making this
---
Hey bro.. thanks for using the template
---
r/darrylgang where yall at
---
F
---
I could have done 3D to make it easuer but I only own a potato PC
---
Gg earlier we got matched in brawl ball and you pretty much carried me so I support you here
---
I think bull should drop a bush down when he dies
---
You're welcome! It's a really well made format.
---
My pleasure
---
And MrBat to warm my but
---
dude it‚Äôs literally always the leon or el primo
---
Rip
---
So you know to do 3D... You are more than a god
---
thank you so much for telling me, he deleted it i think  
---
hope he doesnt post anywhere else though, its so hard to keep track of these art thieves sometimes ; - ;
---
Yes... I saw the minute details... You really have done something amazing out of it
---
That really stinks, but hopefully they can change it soon.
---
On another note, how does someone go about entering a map contest?
---
It doesn't, i'm just pointing out all your team has the same color name. Derp
---
You know i think rank 15 just shows you are a player in the game
---
LOOL
---
It's the same star power but Darryl's one is half a second longer.
---
What the f*ck did you bring opon this cursed Land
---
Should be PWR then
---
How/where do you make maps
---
Oh ok grammer police
---
If this gets added it will cost 100,000 Star Points
---
It has custom models, animations (winning, losing, attack, death, spawning), and voices
---
At least you have Leon.
---
K
---
Let me know when you find out.
---

---
O
---
MediBang paint, once you figure everything out it‚Äôs amazing, before that it‚Äôs crap
---
Do Rico if you want a hardcore challenge
---
It was discouraging for most players.
---
One thing, you have NO details, no health, no dmg. NO NOTHING besides a star power. But anyway this is a great brawler :)
---
Why did this make me laugh? He wants that freaking burger! üòÇ
---
Hey all I‚Äôm Matias and I play Rico
---
u/Ryan_Supercell
---
He has a really long and enormous gun
---
As I said, a rough concept. I have a bunch I wanna make up full characters stats for.
---
It's good :)
---
Giving helpful suggestions is not policing.

Hopefully this gets upvoted so everyone can see this comment üòÖ

Sorry man. Upvoted for visibility.

Thanks for such opportunity! :)

Ooooohhhh you have the Pammy flair looooll
---
I M   M O R T I F I E D

Imagine upgrading all ur brawlers so u dont have coins
---
Credit for limelade for making this meme template
---
Definitely!
---
Thank u
---
You are so wrong in so many ways.
---
That‚Äôs not a fact, they have them set to automatically drop sometime in the middle of their vacation.
---
Shelly = Lyn probably
---
OHH OOOH IK ONE MORE 
---
Kitana- Tara :D
---
Don't worry colt is just mad because shelly is more attractive than him (or would it be shawn?)
---
Oh yes
---
I think Jessie‚Äôs main attack should increase her damage by 275 every time her attack hits another target. So if she‚Äôs maxed it‚Äôs gonna be 1148 &gt; 1432 &gt; 1698
---
Don't trust any name tag you see
---
So you post good, high effort, original comics on r/shittybrawlstars, but you also make *these* kids of posts here?
---
Make Bull‚Äôs ‚ÄúNani?‚Äù face bigger. I wanna meme it
---
How much brawlers you have?
---
gene is better but tara is more fun to play IMO
---
Already have boombox Brock skin and dragon knight Jessie lmao.
---
but if i received tara offer at 169 gems, i can receive also gene offer for around 169 no?
---
Yea just get her. Get her before she goes away tommorow
---
I'd give it 2 months max for them to give up
---
This is so rough darryl
---
OK thanks for the help.
---
Oh that just means i will never get a tara üòü but atlwast i got a piper?
---
Voice is debatable, but skin? Nahhhh it would be fine, he would still be mysterious.
---
Yo welcum
---
I think you should but gene. Tara Is very fun with the ability to kill an entire enemy team but her damage is low, her super charges slowly and she has lower health, so buy gene for more competitive play
---
I see that your crow is only power 4 so that means you must got it recently?
---
He did the same thing to other posts
---
Yes you can
---
If you are refering to the offer, i belive everybody has it. For example, on shop, i have summer jessie an beach Brock offer (Ôæâ‚óï„ÉÆ‚óï)Ôæâ
---
There are trophy balance changes. Read the first post on the "Hot" page of this community to find out more
---
Looks like Pok√©mon sprites! I love it!
---
no sp worths it. use coins only to max out brawlers, if you have all maxed then yes
---
Strongest Star Power in the game right now
---
i got shiba nita on the discount but even for 150 gems i still think it's worth it
---
Its alright now, you got back your map
---
He's one of my favorite characters to play, good job!
---
Oy Frank minus 100 gems that bastard try'na steal his work.
---
It Is the strongest in the game, ez trophies
---
Don‚Äôt waste gems on megas. If anything, wait for a token doubler deal. Megas are the worst value for gems.
---
absolutely
---
**yes**
---
I bought summer Jessie because I like her but I usually buy token doublers
---
It‚Äôs excellent in showdown(solo or duo)...not as great in 3v3s. Depends on your play style, but if you‚Äôve got nothing else to spend the coins on, then yes it‚Äôs worth it.
---
can you not
---
They probably had one of those tilting days, but for a month. Or its a bought account
---
Its amazing and versatile for every mode, a must but indeed
---
You should totally buy it!! I mean, in my opinion, shiba Nita is the best skin in the game. I also bought it when it first launched and I don‚Äôt regret absolutely anything. Anyways, I hope you get it.  ï‚Ä¢·¥•‚Ä¢ î
---
What can one possibly do to make this type of posts stop?
---
Glad that i'm not aloneüòè
---
Yeah Man i like it more and more, so i think i'm gonna buy it.
---
It‚Äôs not your WiFi despite what the game says. It‚Äôs likely your ISP.
---
Same happened to me
---
Gene
---
Its bc it only works for rank 10, 15, and 20. You get 100 for 10, 200 for 15, and 300 for 20
---
Rosa and bibi map :)))
---
Why hello, how much trophies do you have? I have 2andahalf'k we could play together?
---
Because the subreddit would become EXTRA-TOXIC and in general a place to karmafarm in. I personally like what mojang did there
---
Okay if that is your opinion, but in my opinion you can pay up to 100‚Ç¨ if you like the game, because if I‚Äôm buying a regular game that I like, I‚Äôm also paying like 100‚Ç¨ for the game + DLCs. This is how I see that.
---
You ALREADY get star points for getting trophies. Stop making dumb suggestions it doesn't even make sense
---
I tried telling my problem to them on help and support
---
But all they are talking is bullshit
---
More like Robo Onwards.
---
In my opinion save your gems for road rage carl
---
A Faster Reset is EVEN BETTER
---
And that... maybe.
---
It‚Äôs not related to this post, but I find it nowhere to ask beside this pinned one.
---
The thing is I have just received an in-game pop-up news that Supercell games won‚Äôt be available in my country (Vietnam) anymore. 
---
It‚Äôs my soul game now, Brawl Stars, now just suddenly waves goodbye to me.
---
part of Dyna gang
---
LOL
---
Hell ya i GOT her to 600
---
I am happy that my art that is going to get lost in new is still noticed!
---
Why spoiler?
---
Play mortis
---
Hey im ur big bro, come back playing already!
---
I have heard of a brawl stars Megalovania called SHOWDOWN! On SoundCloud! Go find it!
---
Wow, Congrats! You Got Bibi!
---
 Wtf
---
At 0:24 is a frame where the bat isn‚Äôt saying anything... TIME TO MEME DA HELL OUT OF THIS
---
It's taking a long time.. sorry for the inconvenience...
---
100
---
I‚Äôm actually thinking about motor kombat, the mini game from Mk Armageddon. Kitana has a purple car there. Otherwise, an outworld imperial transport kart? Idk
---
It is right what are you saying, but in the match there is not much such "lucky" situations. Most of the time Mortis has to wait this and his team will play 2 vs 3
---
its okay I know it takes a long time take your time mate
---
That seems pretty good, and I think bibi would look good with red hair
---
Will lookoohong get a permaban? He probably won't learn from this
---
You already have a lot of maps in game that are yours! People are jealous!
---
ah yes my cousin watching me from behind
---
OK. Can you send the original to me through imgur? Got a few ideas of making a meme of my own.
---
It is right, but such situations are rare to be fair. Most of the time Mortis just walks around and waits for minute of glory, while his team fights 2 vs 3
---
Naw mate he is a tissue box that‚Äôs where they come out
---
–ô–µ–π
---
Im waiting uwu
---
Carl?
---
Definitely.
---
I‚Äôm ok with it. Everyone draws what he or she wants. You don‚Äôt have to look at these drawings.
---
I posted the same thing awhile but you made it better
---
‚ÄúAlthough we will continue to negotiate with the government and local partners, we still do not have any long-term and effective solutions to continue to operate in the Vietnamese market.  I hope that this will not be a farewell, and we will find ways to continue developing our game towards Vietnamese players‚Äù - Supercell
---
Well i hope my government won‚Äôt ban supercell
---
That's satisfying
---
How come you hit 2000 but still don't have Poco? That's unlucky.
---
Is there explanation why it is discontinued?
---
Not any more special than the star points versions, but still special I guessü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
It‚Äôs in Vietnamese but it says for ‚Äúlegal reasons‚Äù. I don‚Äôt even know why is Brawl stars illegal
---
We can find it in photoshop I think, but it won't be the same.
---
And i do . But some i prefer to upgrade before others , thats how i got my star power so early
---
I just found out if he doesn't have crow he will get it for free
---
Yo man Colt isn't just a brawler. Colt is a way of living.
---
The joke is that Poco does so little damage that even at Power 10, the number of subscribers ends up exactly one more than his damage. Two unrelated things that I stumbled across at the same time, and it clicked in my head, and bam! a meme!
---
Clicked and got free legendary, hope supercell doesn't find out.
---
You have my sword!
---
definitely...  I am Definitely Unlucky
---
ok, but the template and images credits? did you make one of the images or what?
---
Bro this is so embarrassing. Delete your post

have some patience, they are on summer vacation, let them a bone.

Imagine somone thinking this is about 3v3 lol
---
This is a repost!
---
Why would it
---
I feel bad for that crow. Just chilling and then sees some pinball machine ball looking thing and just fucking dies
---
ok, first: what the fuck
---
second: yes.
---
actually im renaming myself gatonook but im lazy to do it on every site lol
---
My hand?

The bug has a update
---
i guess you got a snake on his boots
---

---
 jk
---
No problem its okay my man , its my original clip
---
Tick is actually pretty decent. Got him up past 500 with him at level 6 before I got enough points to upgrade him.
---
Coltception : The movie
---
F for Penny's nose.
---
And mortis with the third star power he might get
---
I have tara so they r just offering me 180 power points

Amazing.

Nice sausage  UwU

They r deleting all supercell accounts made in Vietnam
---
He meant spin to win as in Carl's super spin
---
so cute!
---
I feel so bad for u. If I was in that spot then... I would lose 12k trophies with all brawlers
---
For what? It is just a nickname
---
Frank confirmed that it was a bug
---
And what?
---
Oh
---
No it's not a punch in the face, because I'm not petty.
---
To me this gives me a chance to push brawlers past 500 without being afraid of tilting them. THE SKILL GAP IS STILL THE SAME,a 300 trophy play will only get around 800, a 500 should be in the 1k's
---
Just be happy u can push aswell ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
YES I UNTILTED ALL MY BRAWLERS. Finally ppl don't team so much cos there's more for everyone. I'm not a teamer thanks for ending my suffering sc.
---
More useful than her old SP w/ my playstyle
---
Many of us do, actually.
---
Thanks.

I forgot the link though

Thank you

That sucks, hopefully there‚Äôs a way to continue playing.
---
You get them at rank 10, 15, and 20

I was not planning on it

So what?

Yep
---
Teaming in high trophies
---
Bad randoms
---
*Mortis left the chat*

They couldn‚Äôt have been any clearer about this...

Ryan is a real life superhero!

You dont have Tick?
---
Apparently shelly is more manly than colt if you think about it....... This art speaks the truth
---
**No, MR BAT IS UP MY ASS**
---
Mecha skins are amazing.

The only way to truly win is to not play

3 to 5 sec is a good idea to me, wont harm too much, only Shelly mainly lol

---
you are obviously using some modified a pee kay
---
The skin in the middle is dirty, why are they hugging him?
---
You have my love
---
Check is that him?
---
Maybe he/she means that he/she hasn‚Äôt unboxed a brawler in six years
---
Oof, I know, my response was more of a joke than serious
---
(At 500 brawler trophies) Let's say that I play 2 games of gem grab. I win one and lose the next. A win gives you 8 and a loss reduces your trophies by 6. All in all you only gain 2 trophies. I don't see how you are rewarded to be bad.

Honestly yeah

Thx!
---
you can use another apple id in iphone, like in beta where players acess to the canada store to download the beta, and with your supercell id you should can play the game
---
Ok you actually make me laugh (p.s. does barley even have a pp)
---
Wow thanks I thought Carl and reduce damage for 4.5 sec lol
---
My Shelly strat for big game would be gone completely.
---
Why is this post so popular?
---
Tf, most of the people I saw on Reddit like it. This is not a true fact
---
2k?
---
How do you get your map into the game? Post in this community? I rarely see any map post in this sub. Sorry for asking, hope you would answer cuz I want to start making maps too
---
Teaming is bad... mkay
---
If this exists, Ricos will go extinct, because one of his unique mechanics is his fast-refill super
---
Or if you have spike save for robo spike since it will start at 150
---
Don't worry....Barley picture is ugly too !
---
I don‚Äôt think you understand.. I‚Äôm saying that I agree with your point, just that he wasn‚Äôt using a maxed Leon
---
Why would you get banned for using it, it's a stat tracking app that pulls information, it doesn't interact with the brawl stars app.
---
Totally agreed. I‚Äôm going to go with yellow for friendly and standard enemy red for enemies tho, because the yellow flame is kind of a tribute to Scorpion. A blue Scorpion may be confused with Sub-Zero, his rival.

What??. Sorry we mostly speak English.

That Shelly may not be a noob... After you play 1 game of gem grab you can win 8 now and then you can sync supercell and get barley. Ultimately making Shelly forgotten.

What excites me is that this link up is the paris saint germain \*\*\*edition\*\*\*. So does that mean more teams will be partnering with supercell?

Same with barley. If you didn't have him and you did supercell id you would get barley and the skin for free.

Give the credit bruh

Magnum Special on Brock allows him to directly snipe the IKE
---
However imo showdown is basically a game of strategy to either kill or facilitate the kill of as many people as you can until ur the only one standing. The Shelly is just playing how you‚Äôre supposed to play the hunger games.

That‚Äôs why I left my comment you idiot

Stop insisting on your point of view, it is incorrect, just accept it. You are wrong, back down, learn some manners. And don't cause a problem for people that already are in a bad position.

Never been an issue for anything else other than brawlstars. Other supercell games are fine, laptops fine, online gaming fine.

Just brawlstars.

WHAT!?  You‚Äôve never played Bush Simulator?

It's different of piper and crow..

And a cross attack.. no?

I would love to see a brawler with this attack

Dang you must be really good

Not a lot, 1850
---
I'm vietnamese and damn when i logged on to brawl stars and saw  this my brain went blank.... do you have any idea to update the game on android?
---
I feel you
---
The grandpa worked as a nuke
---
I agree with you completely.  I don‚Äôt care if you unlocked Band-Aid or got to 500 with Leon.
---
Dude you‚Äôre just getting better and better üëç keep it up
---
Yep. I had some lucky plays with Mortis too.
---
one of my favorite maps good work man
---
Nice username
---
Dang my first 500 was Tara which was like a couple days ago
---
Repost from a few months ago
---
She sounds like me when I have to wake up early
---
Been playing since the beginning of this year, only have 1850 trophies. I've got every brawler except for Tick, Mike, Crow, Gene, Mortis and Bo
---
L P R I
---
Nice. I'm gonna see if I want to get Tara as my second brawler to 500.
---
Both these Star powers will undirectly nerf frank
---
found out why randoms are so bad
---
J E S S
---
You spelled weird wrong
---
My closest second closest to 500 is bo at like 426 trophies
---
This is WAY BETTER than the new remodel. I dunno, i think they gave Tara the actual remodel only to put a low effort voice. I believe in Supercell, maybe after rhe summer break they will release a big update...
---
This could definetly be in the game. I think It seems really good and fun to play.
---
Nice my next closest is bo at 426
---
Did you make the template?
---
Where did u find it?
---
Dyna
---
No. People will play more aggro just to do more damage and get star player ruining the teamwork
---
I'm waiting for a leon skin.
---
Nice. Mine is Rico at 434. Honestly I wouldn't get Mortis this high without the trophy changes.
---
Yeah, but in this case the game is forbidden in that country, they might be more strict

Can you all please chill out? Like the skins are just there to make money. Besides, he is literally the best overall brawler in the game.

\*\*Teaming rates in solo SD drops to 0%\*\*

how about i take this aperture science handheld portal device and ooen a quantum tunnel right here and other on the moon

I had this idea before but I just don‚Äôt have the skills to make this quite yet
---
JEBA
---
WOW YOU WON IT'S SO FUNNY HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
---
I thought they were gonna cost star points
---
Its a recolor. Yay?
---
wow i have 12.1k trophies and i only have 1 legy
---
Basically way back when there was an underlying hate for the Native Americans which boiled over to them literally blaming them for everything and lynching the lot. Then the same happened in the mid-90s with the LGBT community when they suddenly got the blame again from the people in the state. Arguably similar now, if Top Gear's experience is anything to go by
---
F ank

Imma try it with my nose

crow because hes literally a crow

This is a good idea

**How about you lost the batteries so it doesn't work? Just forget about that machine and come to the cellar or I will have to come there**
---
Am I yelling at you? No, he needs a skin and he needs one soon, pretty much the whole community agrees too....
---
My god man, read your damn club messages
---
Im worried about their toes
---
Just because i said Alabama 100 doesn't mean that i'm anti lgbt
---
Why -2 upvotes for me?
---
Leon
---
Bibi
---
Tick
---
Power points are sort of supposed to be grinded for, i think its balanced as of now
---
Yeah, the first option is the better one, just put two in case someone wants to edit or add on.
---
I feel like they should make it like clash royale where people from your clan can donate power points
---
ok the machine doesnt even use batteries its just the container of the quantum or some shit i need to re-read the portal lore
---
anyways it cant be out of batteries
---
Wow, that's actually a great idea.
---
But it is
---
‚ÄúMy goodness what an idea! Why didn‚Äôt I think of that?‚Äù
---
I‚Äôm glad more of you lowbies are coming to the 500-600+ club. It‚Äôs been very lonely up here.
---
Good job Ryan!
---
sure!
---
Hey OwenReds, thanks for designing this map! You'll get credit for it in-game when the next update rolls in. The person who plagiarized you only gave your map more visibility :)
---
Great work with the maps you've made already, millions of Brawl players are enjoying them every week!
---
Dude look at the one that lost they gpt a leon trolling
---
150
---
Yeah but i pushed when has ben added tick and it was the normal trophy balance
---
 Bro I have like 7 brawlers on my power 1 accounts and I got Spike
---
That's completely right, however I do see everyday colts playing like third parties bulls and it is annoying as hell cuz they are not supposed to be camper shit
---
It's just leave and enter messages so....
---
oh well
---
Imma try it with both sixshooters
---
Hey just so you know, your name wasn't blurred out for a frame at 0:21.
---
I wanted to make something that had a little bit for everyone; bushes to creep in, some launch pads, a little open field for long range fights, some mid-map walls for throwers, etc. I like the potential for some long range poke on the sides before the water kind of forces you into a bush area. The map designer I used didn't show the trajectory for launch pads, I'm not sure if the Brawler would land in the ponds or not, but I just want with it cause I liked the design. Hope you like! Any feedback appreciated.
---
No
---
It can actually be like you said.. i think we have to wait..
---
Sad
---
Yeah...is like stats royale from clash royale

I hope your mom is proud right now

Really good map would love playing this since there arent a lot if bushes for people to camp in although thats an in game concept. Anways great work hope it goes well! üëçüèª
---
Oh! I DON'T HAVE MYTHICS EITHER. BUT I HAVE TWO LEGENDARIES. You know, I actually wonder. How do I get Leon and Crown but I don't have Mortis or Tara or Gene. I've been playing since android and I am at 8005 trophies.
---
Check me out pls. #ROVVCUP2

 Time after use of 2th star power 4,1s

Did you win?

Well yes, but actually no

I agree üòÇ

No!!! This is trash.

I like it, nothing else would have fit as well as a spooky Tara.

Thanks I got Shelly, only brawler I missed.

When?

nerf leon‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.

It looks well until the eye and the hair

Awww is someone mad ü•∫

At least bush campers still play \*\*solo\*\* in \*\*solo\*\* showdown. Teaming should be against the rules.

She's villian. Not a childish character. Look at her eyes(in the game). Badass evil woman))
---
Its a mostly a joke thread but some of them are genuine.
---
PYRO: mmmph mmh mmp a mm mm you?
---
Tick is a terrible name. I see how it‚Äôs related to his mines, but it‚Äôs not even a name. I think he should be called Clay.
---
Leon has become the very thing he swore to destroy
---
Nah I prefer the current one
---
This is awesome
---
Nah u good on my other alt I have like 15 brawlers and no legends

"Solo Showdown: Every brawler for themselves!"

***Are you sure about that***

It‚Äôs because they didn‚Äôt even try

Would you have to complete the entire trophy road first or anyone can do it by, buying or playing?

What di you mean?

Penny's cannon not turret lmao

Ur getting an upvote for doing that mistake XD

You‚Äôre trolling right?

Yeah what else are they gonna post about though

Jessie's turret with new Nita's star power

Woah. That is so cool.

Watch yo shit

Leon wasn't post-release though...

You are right! Thanks for the comment!

Make it more realistic and turn the blue stuff red

Working on it

No ones ever happy anymore. Give the plebs something they‚Äôre angry. Trophy inflation and Tara‚Äôs voice - only to hear screams of anger.

# FRANK EXE.
---
Is it me or does he look taller?
---
about what?
---
Shelly - Super, Gene - Voice, Poco - Voice
---
Yes  i want it
---
because choosing names that are easy to pronounce and short in letters makes it very easy to remember.
---
Although this is cool, I do like Tara how she is now
---
Would be nice but it would be annoying to see it on your screen so maybe an option to turn it off?
---
Bad idea. So many things wrong. Mostly it would be way too easy to dodge shots
---
Surprised frank isn‚Äôt higher, what with his amazing super (even tho it‚Äôs easily cancelled).
---
#EEAOII
---
Its modded and this is fake
---
It would definitely not be nice for them to easily dodge my piper shots
---
Wowow

Woah dude 200 is A lot od trophies

Yeah, he's my irl brother. He asked me to make it.

The events give you a lot of coins if you‚Äôre good and have doublers.
---
Yeah, I remember getting super turbo championship edition (i think thats what it was called) and i remember seeing brawl stars getting launched *after* getting Guacamelee. first thing i thought was "wow guacamelee theme clone". Not entirely true but you get the idea.
---
Horrible idea...
---
I have no favourites cuz every brawler has weaknesses
---
Brazil or Portugal
---
I'm disappointed.
---
If you have any ideas to make it better make sure to comment

poco doesn't need a buff. He's perfectly good how he is now.
---
Hah
---
This has nothing on Fronk
---
That‚Äôs because those are strategies and can be countered. For example, you can bush check and you can some extent avoid getting 3rd partied. But teaming is just unfair
---

This is cute :D

Isn't it still hard to get to 500?
---
Mortis literally means dead.
---
Nope I got 22 rank 20s in the past 4 days
---
not at all. its like getting 300 pre update
---
Hajime no Ippo correct?
---
you can't check bushes when you need to heal and are running from an enemy
---
like how primo's head starts freaking out at :20 when he sees the piper
---
I agree
---
I don‚Äôt see your point here. Do you agree with teaming? Do you people to stop teaming? Do want Supecell to fix it? Give a bitch an answer, please.
---
Yes it haves,supercell can make that because he should made bigger servers and its dont easy.
---
I thinks its modded/well edited beacouse 
---
1. All the star powers are or comunity sugested (mortis,bibi and poco) or were what we were thinking the star power were(carl)
---
2. Think about pocos star power suggested,has no effect on 90% of the brawlers, barly has an affect on 9% brawlers(primo spike shelly...) and fucks crow
---
He does defent damage over a wide range with the ability to heal himself and other.
---
In order to keep replays, they have to save every single input for every single character in order to remake the match exactly. And the reason that it‚Äôs only for over 400 trophies is to keep the amount of data saved from a minimum otherwise they don‚Äôt have enough servers to save the data for the millions of matches there are. By cutting out all the matches under 400, it makes it much more manageable but still a lot of data
---
I sometimes forget that he is a heavyweight
---
AH REALLY
---
No. Actually, it‚Äôs epic and starting brawler
---
What about clash royale im pretty sure you can watch your replays from the very begining?
---
This list can be done in so many different ways for different maps
---
Maybe supercell can be a little more transparent rates and show actual rates for the rarities you need to unlock
---
Well would you look at how poor this comment aged
---
Pocos star power 90% of brawlers=no effect
---
9%=barly a differece(bibi shelly...)
---
And crow gets apsolutly fucked
---
My level 7 penny is also now past 500 trophies! She is the best tbh.

Hey don't uninstall Brawl Stars on your phones you cant download it again
---
Yeah but everybody should have a fair chance of winning, only difference should be their skill. It takes skill to strategize (like bush camping) and it takes skill to counter those strategies (like bush checking). But teaming doesn‚Äôt take skill. It‚Äôs just unfair.
---
Sure, can you send me the link to the video once it comes out
---
Oh ok, thx. Well we mybe should have only one replay at a time, but it doesnt have 400 lock?
