No it’s not necessarily saving up brawl boxes. It’s more just taking the 100+ brawl boxes that they have on their maxed account to hopefully get the newly released brawler.

---
---
I’m a better crow than spike
---
I wish I got Spike since the inevitable Leon nerf will make him bad.  Also, I've had the game only since global because I live in the U.S.A.
---
Ye Xd
---
Not much of an achievement but I got flack for only ranking up Nita when I started playing so I decided to rank everyone up to 10 and passively get them all to 20, just wanted to share.

Wtf? The locked movement control is already on and thats only for movement control (or the blue joystick)

Did u ever got in a bush and got oneshot by bull?

oh yeah

How long have u been playing?

Finnaly i see someone noticing this

&gt;proceeds to defend main criticism

Also, for the record, power 1 mortis was a pain to play solo to rank 10
---
HTC one m7 2gb RAM 5.0.2 the game ran smoothly untill the opcional update so yeah
---
I got Leon from the season bonus, I’m happy as scared since it’s obvious supercell will obviously hit Leon in the near future with a nerf hammer 
---
Lol yeah I wanted to see if anyone noticed😂
---
Haha I know 
---
Imagine his flexibility if he was using jeans shorts. 
---
Maybe It will be her normal bullet, or make the bullet invisible but you can see the outline of it
---
Sorry man, im kinda ticked off right now
---
Added to the game the same day as the Barley revamp. Since there wasn’t an older model for Wizard Barley I didn’t include it.
---
Mime don't talk Xd

What’s the original post?

..

But it’s just part of the game, I’m really not understanding this haha

I had this doubt too, recently I opened a lot of boxes and my leg luck was still the same. But after a while i checked it again and it was like 0.0100 higher.. so check it regularly you will notice it’ll high up in one time

These are of accounts. Don’t really think you can repack rank 15 as power level 1.
---
Crow doesn't need a buff though. He doesn't do a lot of damage next to spike or leon, but his poison utility is just so damn good. The heal block is the best utility passive in the entire game, hands down.
---
We saw people doing it so we did it so I could put it on Reddit 
---
True, just kind of off putting to be fed a free win when you’re trying to correct mistakes.
---
Who else thought he was playing since the start of beta lol

What gamemode? Any tips? I recently got her and don't know hoe to play her.

1. They’re not accounts. They definitely aren’t new players because why would they be smart enough to wait for their whole team to respawn and dumb enough to literally move directly on top of each other?
---
2. You really think someone is going to reach higher than rank 10 as power 1?
---
3. Don’t downvote someone and claim they’re wrong without proving it yourself. It’s a bit childish.
---
Stay quite passive with her, even if you have a lot of power cubes, don’t rush in on people (if she is like lvl 1-3). I found showdown being really good for her, especially Thousand Lakes Solo, got a good 400 trophies by just playing there. I just got her recently too so im not much of an expert xD but ye thats about it.
---
Thicc
---
Not to be that guy but I think it’s whim not limb

I just started playing. But how would you pay to win this game? Cant everybody rank up characters for free?? 
---
•Has the Health of 2950
---
•285 per Cannonball(Fires 4 after each shot)
---
•Has the range a little bigger than Nita's.
---
•Super:640(Fires giant cannonballs in a 360° manner)
---
•Star Power: Canella deals double damage after falling below half health.
---
I also unlocked crow! he felt a bit bad the first day I played him \*COUGH\* yesterday \*COUGH\*, but now Im on rank15 lvl2 and almost always in the top3 in Showdown and becoming a better gem carrier :)
---
Tip: Try to not to focus your attacks on 1, but on multiple opponents. Poison does not stack and it's just too great to have your Super ready.
---
&amp;#x200B;

It was just a joke tho, just cus it also did it on Clash Royale at some point

If you’re not than that’s great, it’s good to have a second language

Brawl Stars x Super Smash Bros

I think if I saw that I’d probably never stop running 
---
I know we die to a bull just as easy as any other brawler
---
me too pls
---
Mine is better.
---
It is common knowledge that his star power isn't very good yes.
---
Just because other people who just started playing agree with you doesn't mean you're right lmao. Good job you just proved you're bad at the game + are a child! Nothing wrong with that, just grow up and become better 
---
This is absolutely insane!! Love it!
---
So basically he beats people with a stick
---
Wow. This looks really good
---
Who

Fr
---
Clash Royale started to decay when they started to put more effort than needed on eSports that is less than 5% of the players that play the game. I would not like the same for Brawl Stars I prefer that they focus on new enhancements for regular players than starting to focus on eSports..

It’s good man

[Here](https://gamewith.net/brawlstars/article/show/2230) is a list of all the brawlers and their star powers. Now for maxing out brawlers, that depends on what you like to play the most and want to push with. It is obviously best to know the mechanics and how to play every brawler but starting out, just choose one you think is fun to play with and try to be the best you can with it.
---
There are 22. The Darryl to the right of Crow is probably what you’re missing (it’s his hat).
---
The middle, a land where no Bulls dare to step.
---
Unless someone steps first, then they are free to go and kill whoever goes there.
---
Dang you beat me at it
---
Heheheh
---
I think that's a bug you should report it to the Brawl Stars team. After joining a disconnected or idle disconnect match, you should be able to have control over your brawler again.
---
Dude forget the fact that u dropped super hard,its impressive enough u got that high

In the video there is a bush at the very right of where shelly came out of and that spot was never checked. You should have a 3 by 3 circle of vision but you never went near that bush at all.
---
Maybe I didn’t rephrase correctly. I’m calling for a big fix rather than a mechanical change, if what you are saying is correct then how do I peek a bush to die and have a Bull re appear as the respawn countdown has already began?

Pam op

Well since your colt has only 54 trophies, Supercell made it so that you gain more for winning in showdown and lose less when getting last place. Once you get above 300 trophies, in non-showdown game modes, you lose 5 trophies for losing and gain 5 trophies for winning.
---
What lol? Honestly I thought I was gonna lose mainly because barley is an AOE brawlstar and there were 2 of them, but turns out it wasn’t as bad as I thought

What the actual fuck........

Actually I think the commenter was referring to the minecraft minigame on mineplex that was essentially the same concept except you expanded your area by getting kills
---
OH MY GOD FINALLY SOMEONE ON THE SAME PAGE AS ME
---
barley will be OP in this map. ALso, Pam would be the best the best gem grabber in this map.  Spike Leon will also be very strong in this map. However, tanks, mid-ranged brawler doesn't really do well in this map. 
---
As a result, this map is just another typical gem grab map, but doesn't support a variety of brawler to play in it. Because the best brawler in this map is Pam, Barley, Leon, Spike. That's all,,,,,
---
sory for my bad English

Ohh I see what you mean I totally misunderstood the issue. I feel dumb. Yeah in that case I think the consistency could actually be game changing.

When the enemy is closer to home than you think

Yea if you play her right she can carry the team

If you the menu icon in the top right with the three bars, a little screen will pop up and click on "Help and support."

I'd say Leon's being overpowered is missing, but he'd be invisible—which is another cliche that is missing, but it'd be invisible anyway.

bos star power ruins it, snake prairie is only fun at low trophies

ommgggggg!!! I got crow ur so lucky nnnb

Thank u for putting a watermark reposters cant steal this quality post anymore

\*sigh\* theyre redoing all of the shitty models, it just takes time, thats why you have some characters like nita that look super clean and then some like bo and piper that look meh

Upvote this comment if u believe the sky is blue

thanks man hope to see you play!
---
Push your brawlers evenly. First and last brawler should be 120 trophies away at most.
---
Upgrade brawlers evenly untill lv.6, then one at a time to lv.9 so you can gen starpowers from boxes.
---
Watch kairos time on how to not do 10 noob things (vid from 4 days ago or so)
---
And don't buy a brawler from the shop less rare than the rarest brawler you still have to get. So if you got epics in the shop but you still need the legends, don't buy those epics, cuz in the time to get the legends, you'll get those epics anyways.
---
Don't camp bull in showdown. It will make it easy to pish with bull, but you won't learn anything from it, which makes it harder for you te get him to 500!
---
(I'm 10.1k)
---
Poor thing
---
Hahah ikr 
---
She should shoot water balloons
---
I sort of like old Bull.
---
Because bull trained a lot ;))
---
It's supposed to be sort of a emo look I guess because Leon would probably be emo as he wears his hoodie 24/7 and hides his face
---
True that

:)

I didn't know those existed and I also didn't think about it. If I were you u/xLlawliettx try and check it out, cant hurt to try :)

Wait till donghoon sees this

But.. but it brought me from 10k trophies to 10.5k trophies

Impossible, how can you have this much power at once!
---
That tongue is actually a tongue of a chameleon. He is like nita,  but nita wears dead bear's hat and Leon wears chameleon's body or smth.  No idea tbf

Sick🤙
---
So max Spike might be good on some SD maps? I'm just soooooooo close to max him, 25 tokens and then SP. Any recommendations? Will he work in most game modes/certain maps specially?

Yes, occurs every now and then.

My clan has 90 people and the top ten play with each other, the rest it’s just a fuck-fest

Sorry for bad grammar
---
This could be a good idea, the way you laid it out sounds like it would work better in a tournament setting. I think for actually in game purposes it’d be more in line with brawl ball — first to two wins. Besides that I really like this and definitely would love to play this mode
---
How tf Rico is bad?  He is strong support and very good at hard rock mine for example.  It is just they way you play him. I can rush with Leon,  loose and say Leon sucks cus he is weak.  
---
u/Donghoon

I think mine is a bunch of kids that go to school together.. I've made one friend over 21+, and we play everytime we are in together, but damn it gets hard without good players.

Quality post. The donghoon karma farming needs to be brought to light. We have to stop him before he gets too much power

I want to meet that guy who rote that and ask him questions about how was he educated manners by his parents. 
---
I think their idea is to make this game as simple yet addictive as possible , by providing basic know and not going into deep details is to assess them into gaining ppls attention and their curiosity with regards to the game for the longitivity of the game as well of the forums where they can discuss these things. It's a complex strategic planning which works well for casual games. 
---
As a penny main, this image is pissing me off

amazed😍

I don't think so... I would spend the gems in token doublers instead :D

The Leon has it 👀

All Leon Players: He’s ok I guess

Haha i agree

I tried to match the Brawl Stars atmosphere as much as possible and that's why i went for Sunya ! I will write everything here because i know my writing is bad xD
---
SUNYA: THE SUNFLOWER
---
Attack : Throws a petal that comes back to sunya ( sunya's position when thrown). If it hits a wall, it comes back directly. (maybe it could be good to make it come back when hitting brawlers too ?)
---
StarPower : ( I killed a Highlighter for this ) If sunya catches back a petal (because it doesnt come back to HER but to her position WHEN THROWN ) her attack is refilled at a small percentage.
---
Super : She charges sunlight by looking to the sky ( canalisation of x secondes maybe 1 or 2 ) and then 2 choices :
---
1) she throws a MEGA fireball doing MASS damage but its path is shown beforehand during canalisation for the ennemy to dodge ( by making it brighter )
---
2) Like Leon its a "activate for x seconds": she becomes shielded with Light and take no damages for like 5 seconds.
---
Vote for the best one ! Thank you ;)
---
Whoa!!!! Great work!!!! 
---
wdym
---
so everything is a worst bush
---
Imagine being a YouTube/Twitch star in showdown. Everyone would want to kill you first just to fuck with you.
---
So the way they've solved it is they show ??? instead of your name after your brawler reaches certain amount of trophies.
---
lmao
---
Wait were you that account
---
2.6 they are really cool but after the seasonal festivities you don't really use them
---
The sunflower from plants vs zombie could be a potential in the game🤔

How is he good in Showdown? Cant destroy a single box.

"make everyone leon"

Exactly what im doing all the time, atleast 3-4 times per game and god i love those free Powercubes.

It's a straight up rip-off

Yes indeed, I hope you laugh some day buddy 😂

I had to root it and flash a rom. Thought it could run but I thought wrong 😂

A price reduction would make me get a Switch actually. They're just too expensive in my region ATM. I wanted one for Christmas but it was just too much to spend at the time. If it had Brawl Stars on it and a lower price tag in a few months I'd definitely be interested though.

I’m more worried about you walking into 3 enemies

It’s as faster as shotgunners and it’s surely better than other star powers like nita’s or penny’s

Was a game against bots

Did you know there are 4 corners in a map 
---
That's because Spike's a god
---
Yeah, for when you just want to grind the rank on some of your brawlers and the easiest way is solo SD, but you don't want to be rude to your friends and don't play with them

Nah I'm cool with it...
---
I would add diferent kind of boxes you can get with tokens. Like 100 tokens for a brawl box, or 50 for a small box(which contains half of a brawl box). This way you can decide what kind of box you want to open, while at the same time getting the same rewards. This would make it easier to open up millions of boxes as u can open up mega boxes or you can save up for a mega box without having to pay gems for it. Because a mega box is the same as 10 brawl boxes this wouldnt influence the value of tokens, only how quick you spend them and i feel like this could make box opening more fun as opening the same box over and over again gets boring after a while

Excuse me what???

I felt like I was due after my friends had started getting new ones but now I’m starting to lose hope...all I can do now is continue the grind and just assume I’m never going to get any brawlers lmao.  I wish you the best of luck against teaming and bummy matchups!
---
I don't, sorry! I actually can't draw and for me it already looks totally amazing. However if you want me to become a little picky, the nose man!  It isn't that big of an issue, but you get what I mean xD

Brawlers not included, otherwise it would be bull,then dynamike
---
Oh ok
---
That message is the punchline of the post... Obviously it wouldn't get as many. OP was sarcastic in the comments but noone seems to understand. This subreddit's comments are a  bunch of normies
---
Hey,
---
I really like the game although a few aspect of the game make me really angry. This is one of them. How is it possible that two people in a Duo-team use the same brawler? 
---
One week after global, 4500
---
Fine...but try to talk english 
---
It IS THE JOKE WTSFYZVE CH
---
Whew I can only hope I get as lucky as you from that 1600 big box lol.  I’ll just stick to the grind and cross my fingers every box I open lol!
---
Omg I’ve had this event in another game I used to play where you had a limited range of sight. Let me tell you it’s a cool concept, but it’s a hell of an annoying modifier. 
---
Literally, all the people that replied are normies as well
---
Lol if that's so then Thanks Supercell, you could have told me Xd
---
thats... boxes
---
I play mostly solo showdowns btw.
---
loL
---
Randoms.
---
i betit wasnt your money 
---
Wow your super is not even charging. #nerfspike
---
&gt;and the robot has 30k health
---
To be more exact, it has 33k.
---
Posting the reply rn
---
The meteors are so easy to avoid tho and the robot is easy to kill with three people when nothing else is attacking you. These bushes are pretty overkill.
---
Im using a Samsung Galaxy S8+ the game start on full screen but when I enter in a match two black bars comes on the side but if some is killed that notification is in the black borders (mainly happens in showdown) and the brawler movements starts to glitch.
---

The first time that i saw someone trying team in duo... i just said: "it's not possible... not here."
---
Чувак,ты забыл метку и перевод на англ :/
---
Sry misunderstood about fps lol my mistake 
---
I see what you mean through the imbalance of trophies. However, 2/3 of the brawlers on your teams have fairly good match ups against Shelly reducing the point a bit.
---
버섯찡❤
---
Ik :P
---
best one i have ever saw. Nice job!!
---
Teaming up against others in showdown when it's every one against each other shameful
---
Drawn to the FB Coverphoto template and everything. 
---
Spike be lookin precious. 
---
Not sure why u need that wall round the map.  It looks coo but add sun more walls so it won't be just for long range. Maybe call it 'gem eye' . 
---
Honorable , when you  shoot that person in the face
---
Good to see other brawl star/bo4 hybrids! Got one here!
---
I’m doing the same as well. It’s a great way to push yourself to play better. Stressful as hell tho
---

I dont consider myself a piper main or even amazing with her by any means but she's definitely a brawler that is map dependent to be good and have a team comp that can support her sitting back. She has good utility on alot of the gem grab maps that are also bounty maps. She shines in bounty and duo showdown as well. As for how to play her I like to always be moving around and constantly scanning the map while staying away from bushes that are unchecked. Due to her poor reload I usually don't test bushes with her unless it's a very common spot. For aiming you want to do your best to aim where you predict your target is going to move to, example being there's a few gems from a brawler that just died and there's an enemy nearby. Firing at the gems will probably lead to them just walking into your shot. 
---
In short, play cautiously and view the map beforehand to see if there are plenty of open corridors or lines of sights that would make piper useful to a team.
---
I couldn't have explained it better. 
---
I really like to play in my iPad because it has bigger screen than the phone, but I always have to switch to the phone to play with 4G... and Clash Royale is playing fine on the iPad ☹️
---
Rip me, I’ve been playing since initial release in Canada yet still don’t have a single legendary brawler.
---
Who likes serpants piraire
---
The game is forcing this challenge upon me for Rico. Haven't gotten a single token for him yet. So far, rank 10 power 1. 
---
Yes thats the joke
---
Just keep practising with her, try not to auto aim
---
He's not ruining anything so long as he's winning. Judging by him being at the +5,-5 point and is in positive trophies, he seems to not be ruining anything. 
---
Old Brock looks way more badass
---
I like how you hide their eyes 😂 #privacyforeveryone
---
this game would be perfect on switch
---
Unless she flies away with her super lol
---
Happy Cake Day Inazuma__11! To a person that’s charming, talented, and witty, and reminds me a lot of myself.
---
Lol like you can just search up max Bo and make them be on your team
---
Cancer
---
Awesome concept🌟 I personally think it would be a nice and fun addition to the game!
---
You farted on her?! That’s disgusting. /s
---
Na rico sucks. His hp is way to low 
---
@
---
Yeah because piper got the Nerf of the gods
---
U can ask on discord or in ur clan for one and if u can’t find one then don’t play on snake prairie 
---
Thanks anonymous person for silver :D
---
No way. Nintendo is trash can. 
---
Looks cool but I also feel everyone would pick bull and camp that bush around the gem dispenser
---
Who wooooshed who?
---
Wow I'm laughing so much 
---
Frank + showdown
---
Explain better pls?
---
#StopTheSpin #SkinToWin
---
Crow for the win.
---
cool
---
Next level is nokia 6300.
---
Yep, #NotSpinToWin #StopTheSpin
---
HAHAHAHA
---
They are players, their names are just hidden
---
Every name is set to '???' after 300 trophies to prevent recognition of any player.
---
I don't want leon get nerf because i don't have him like spije and they nerf rhem then i am not happy when i get them
---
Can you send me the files!? I would love to do it as well
---
Lets spread our ideas
---
lol this is really cool it should be named super star tho
---
Currently, you can just color your name without any worries. I colored my name to yellow. They maybe will remove it but they didn't announce that yet so I think you can do it
---
Yeah buddy. Let's do it.
---
Git gud
---
#Egyptian dubstep intensifies
---
Why you hide your nick?
---
1. Very nice idea
---
2. This is not fair if you aren't teaming but Supercell thinks you do
---
3. Almost impossible for matchmaking, the delay would double, maybe even longer than double
---
Ice wizard is looking fine 
---
Feels bad 2 be a guitar (.  But the idea is cool
---
👀
---
Whats an anti-team?
---
I mean, talk in english
---
I got crow at 800
---
You make a team to kill a team
---
Very good idea except his super sounds incredible powerful so I think it be best if it is ready in 10 hits. His main attacks should do 1k dmg too. Everything else is fine. He should also have a fast move speed.
---
Facts...
---
Well kinda...
---
Colt can still be better (colt mains plz not commit angry)
---
Jesus Christ 
---
or upgrade his brawler... for that matter
---
Wait. So colt is a little over 10?
---
How would you describe the size of your fuse?
---
It seems to😂
---
Ok thx btw how high r u maybe we can play
---
Honorable: the way that makes you/your team win.
---
May I ask what reason that was?
---
r/TeamAndBetray
---
300 gems 😲😵😵😵
---
You’re just mad at teaming because you don’t know how to play battle Royale games
---
I’m pretty sure it’s intentional lmao 
---
Played in beta, got bo, became free:(
---
The dude only plays showdown, nothing to worry about.
---
Very low
---
With the Ocarina of Time cemetery! Nice
---
Good Job! Here is your Scooby-Snack.  
---
Git gud scrub
---
No he was just going through a phase 
---
Tru
---
Excuse me is that a cigarette I see? I'm going to have to ask you to leave.
---
Say that to the rocket launcher :) 
---
r/whoosh
---
Thats a good reason too
---
I think i saw this at another game sub that starts with b, nice job getting free karma on someone elses idea..
---
Glad to see I play someone from each skill level. Also Bull should be low
---
i spy a smurf
---
Don't team then, you rotten scumbag!
---
I love the dynamike
---
Seria muito top
---
I'm gonna do all of these things in my next showdown game just to spite you personally
---
I SO so sorry didnt mean to ofend anywone
---
the fuck?
---
Nice hand and stairs!
---
Colt, Pam, Rico, spike, and Tara all cover more area than barley when attacking
---
bushes..... bushes.... BUSHES EVERYWHERE!
---
Hahahah, this is too good lmao
---
Thats the plan
---
can i grab that stl?
---
Whet happens if boomerang hits a wall?
---
This skin is sweet! 
---
Need to ask my friend for the plans. He’s he one with the printer
---
Need to ask my friend, it was his 3-D printer.
---
I’ve been playing since beta and I’m at 3.8k
---
Good luck teaming with Bull
---
Greta idea as a skin for spike
---
It ok i guese i got leon on 2nd week of playing
---
I’m doing really well on my drawing!
---
Maybe make spike yellow / different color? Too similar to normal 1 imo
---
weird flex but ok
---
When they add replays, they should add report button, the support just see the replay and the teamers are ban for playing showdown for 30 minutes, and the time will increase if you repeat very times in a day, been possible to be banned for 1 day in showdown.
---
It'd take at least half the match, but they'd probably eventually be found, but if they're all together they could probably kill the most likely one person that finds them, evade or kill the others, and move to another spot. It's definitely really dangerous bunched up together like that if one of the enemy players manages to build an ult
---
Ahaha this is great
---
Coll
---
And than hide in the bush and dont show it at all
---
What mode?
---
A 420 Shelly called Shelly?
---
Translate 😂
---
Everyone wants in on the hype!
---
great idea....
---
Again, it's not that big, trust me, the only gamemode i play is Showdown lol
---
It’s not 100% reflected or else I think it would be a great map.
---
I love that Ricochet.
---
Littarly same. But the only thing is it works perfectly on lte and wifi is laggy and stop loading or kick me out of matches
---
Now you are cursed
---
Upvote if Down voted for snitching on the truth.
---
I don't see the problem
---
That's it
---
Thanks!
---
Ricochet &amp; mortemer
---
I just see a white picture
---
The the’s are back?
---
They should add Graphics Settings
---
Just a *better colt.
---
There.. fixed it for you.
---
Aww
---
no, this.
---

Nice,Dont forget to link it.
---
bull doesn't have a skill cap lol
---
I got Pam thus morning
---
Alto momazo 
---
Didn’t get the donghoon thing and the icon on the bottom right corner 
---
Why Bug?
---
Brawl Ball.
---
Its 1 lvl one main brawler challenge maybe ur brain is poor...
---
I'm F2P
---
every brawler is good in showdown 
---
Hi F2P, I'm dad!
---
ditto
---
no because u use the infinitive after querer
---
Both
---
No maxed bo?
---
Poco in Showdown it‘s awful
---
... is great for a change. Glad to see an even match
---
Yup. Btw, you can see your own profile in the leaderboard
---
So it's not just me that feels like playing on WiFi an absolute shit experience. What is why I play over cellular data.
---
Kkkkkk
---
on the bright side if your phone disappears you won't be needing the super
---
At least put like /s or something so kids don't get tricked
---
I think some guys actually tried that against my team. In the first 30 seconds, we couldn't find them. But i was with a maxed Bo, then :v
---
No, there a ton of people every youtubers and streamer's complaining about that issue. It depents on the device if you lagg from wifi or lte. I used my older phone with same phonenumber and i startwd laggig with lte and wifi was fine
---
Nita, when played by someone who knows how is not a low skill cap noob
---
Can you do a contests where people make brawler concepts and theost upvoted on gets put into the game
---
God Bless
---
Why would you reply to that guy then?
---
BRS!!!!
---
???
---
I don’t know seeing mortis I don’t even have a heartbeat anymore
---
Yes
---
I spend way too much time on this
---
It kills me but Nintendo is the only console company I’m supporting for the near future. 
---
After COD BO2 and then coming back around for Destiny/2 I’m done supporting companies that put their stock prices first. With the DLC Monster it’s hard not to throw Nintendo in that category but at least they’re trying to innovate in a positive way and their games have always been A1.. 
---
Just my thoughts at least! Would be hype af if BrawlStars followed FortNite and got on the Switch! 
---
Ypu better bushlieve it
---
Via the first permanent offer; you could only get 795 coins for 106 gems instead of the 800 offered. Not sure how that’s a negative misrepresentation 
---
Ok but there is something in the map called big game and I created that
---
As the notification makes your game lag and the bull kills you
---
They can do that with all the controllers
---
where is the luck percentage located?
---
Mummy pig
---
It’s likely that they are bots
---
2200 Trophies. Only Penny, Mortis, Spike, Leon left to go!
---
Its a bad joke
---
Modern problems require modern sokutions ;)
---
It only seems to you, most Russians hate you, Americans. A survey was conducted around 2014, it turned out that 85% of Russians hate Americans. I do not know how now. Yes, and in Russia is not very good with the quality of houses. In general, not very nice with us.
---
Don't mess with.. TEHBULLLLL
---
Good on you for making a mature decision to reject alcoholic drinks. 
---
damn nvm then... guess I won’t be welcomed but then again that was 4 yrs ago
---
And those shellys were brocken
