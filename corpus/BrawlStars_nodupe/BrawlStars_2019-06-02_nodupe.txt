Dont play showdown. Or play duo. I play solo all the time and dont team and do just fine. If you cant deal with it dont play it.
---
Lol thanksüòÇ

I can screenshot you and show you my trophies if you need üòÇüòÇüòÇ

Thx sooo much you the best

Good thinking ü§§

What‚Äôs wrong with saying someone is trying hard. Are you denying scholars if their efforts,
---
No
---
86? More like 6.8.
---
1 Star token for 30 trophies! That‚Äôs a 69% discount!

All packs are the same from my understanding, I bought the first one and the second one is the exact same, so I‚Äôd assume the third would also be 4.99 USD for 2100 coins. I may be wrong though

Stop posting requests for people to stop posting request for a report button. It's a thing that Brawl Stars really needs and there's a reason behind why people want it.

Sorry but why were you showing us the dynamike instead of the actual action
---
Pulls 7 rosas with super
---
Poncho should spit
---
Nah they not a ship they like tha brotha and tha sista relationship like good friends
---
With a 490 trophy Shelly, on that specific map, enemy team with 7 gems, and gameplay aiming for 9k trophies, yes it‚Äôs a legitimate strategy bro
---
Nice teaming
---
I know that feeling. #noboinseige/heist bc that happens a lot to my team
---
Yeah, that Bibi only had 187 and you guys all had 300+, very unfair
---
U know i could of kill him easily but he helped me at 1st so...
---
That'd be for your entire team, sir
---
Bibi‚Äôs star power should let her use her normal attack to redirect her bubble if it bounces by her. She wouldn‚Äôt need a charged home run bar to do this.
---
Brawl Stars is not even 3 years old...

this is soo good bro‚Äî

Legend
---
Piper

Yea I know but I believe that they aren‚Äôt limited time. They didn‚Äôt say there were
---
The trophy loss thing is to make people play maybe. Cause if you could win trophies, you start a game, leave to do something, and comeback (I have no idea)
---
The joke is where 100-20% is the same thing as 80 so you are happier paying for the exact same thing
---
I understand what you mean but I felt that would over complicate things and I feel that since Rob is so squishy and Poncho only gives him an extra 2000 health that will compensate for the lack of a deterioration effect.
---
Kid, saying it isn't yours doesn't change anything. This is stolen and a repost, in an attempt of getting karma by doing nothing. Grow up
---
The frick
---
Just now thought of that. Cool.
---
For Gene: When a brawler is getting pulled in, his reload speed increases (by a little; doubled would be way to OverPowered)
---
If its not a repost then there was already a post exactly like it.
---
They just did a whole brawl talk about it early this year.
---
24 trophies, Damn
---
exactly what i‚Äôm thinking. gonna upvote you and downvote him
---
What is the point of put "D" without using that
---
Crow - every second he moves for, he moves 5% faster (stacking) until he shoots, takes damage, or stops moving 
---
Piper - a max range shot can destroy walls (her reload is long enough that it wouldn't be unfair) 
---
Dynamike - his tnt gains velocity based on his movement (so moving forward adds that much speed)
---
Rosa - walking over destroyed bushes regrows them
---
Colt - each consecutive hit increases his damage by 20% on his next shot
---
Shelly - every 3 seconds she holds her super without shooting it, she loads another shot into the blast (finger on the super)
---
Bo - when bo shoots, bushes his arrows passed through remain visible until his next shot or death
---
Leon - using his super next to a teammate grants them a similar effect for 3 seconds
---
Tara - Tara's shadow re-emerges from her after it dies if she is at full health
---
Gene - his super pushes enemies within 5 tiles away instead of pulling them
---
Poco - super deals light knockback to enemies
---
Pam - when a brawler heals from Pam's turret, she heals 40% of the amount gained
---
Spike - hitting an enemy with the spike ball before it explodes sticks it to them, and it explodes on their next health recovery
---
Bull - regains 200 health instantly when taking damage (resistant to colt, gene, Pam, Leon, but not so much piper or brock or any other single hit one) alternatively, bull could deal extra damage to a random enemy (call it bully lol)
---
Brock - charging shot makes it home in on the nearest enemy
---
Primo - killed enemies drop a power cube (extra in SD)
---
Nita - adds a button to control the bear's movement
---
Penny - shots explode into coins at the end of their path
---
Barley - bottles leave glass shards where they hit, dealing 1 damage (heal disruption)
---
Mortis - nearby enemies can be damaged by allies
---
Frank - hitting enemies removes super charge
---
Rico - balls bounce off enemies too!
---
Bibi - killing an enemy with a home run hit increases their respawn time by 10 seconds
---
Carl - faster speed and can drift in his minecart
---
Jessie - standing still for 10 secs on her turret upgrades it, making it deal more damage and shoot farther
---
Darryl - hitting an enemy with dash deals bleed damage over 10 secs
---
No. In all honesty this has never been done before
---
Plz piper is legal I swear
---
üñêüèª
---
Does that happen when you go above 120 exp
---
F
---
Rip Josh's Leon, lived a good life
---
I mean change things up - let people team up in 3s for show down, allow people to customize or modify things. The game is getting stale once you play for about 9 months.
---
wrong equation.
---
Her Star Power should make her walk on or across water, right?
---
Including enemies

---
No, not OP. Think about how costly it is to waste a shot that takes that long to reload on destroying a wall?
---
Yeah we just have a casual killer cactus in the diner, nothing much. Nice art btw!

Normal or slow -- 720

Medium or HeavyWeight categories -- 770

I love this so much. I‚Äôve always wanted a brawler with a revolver and this is a very fresh take on it.
---
How do you have that nita in front of your name?
---
Dark mode enabled

You want them to make complicated and unnecessary additions to the game when there are clearly other things that need to be brought to attention first? Yea ok

De seguro eres un pendejo que recien esta empesando el juego y no sabe que vale y que no vale o pero aun de seguro eres un ni√±o tonto que no sabe en que vale y en que no vale gastar

---
I think he would just run away instead, supercell has to keep it kid friendly üòÖ
---
It looks an oficial trailer, very good!
---
I have an idea where different skins have different star powers
---
Bandita Shelly - Star Grab
---
When she uses her super the enemy will be dragged closer, ensuring maximum damage
---
after which they will fly out again
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Star Shelly - Out of this world
---
When Shelly uses her Super,  Enemies will be stunned for a very brief duration of time.
---
Nita
---
Panda Nita - Black and white
---
Anyone hit by Nita's bear will turn black and white, staining the floor with clear black inky footprints. Which only Nita can see.
---
Rednose Nita - Santa's gift
---
Bruce's has been granted Santa's magical reindeer powers! Now he moves 50% faster! WOW!
---
Shiba Nita - Golden bell
---
Nita will not only send out a dog but also hang a Koi banner in the spot the dog was placed! The Koi banner will always send a small amount of HP to Bruce until either the banner of Bruce dies. If Bruce dies, the koi banner will also vanish.
---
I will stop here. Let me know if u want to hear more!

Wait a moment
---
I did something similar to this and posted but only got 100 updoots. I guess yours took more effort
---
Everyone talking bout Penny, so i might as well.
---
Penny star power can steal remain as Last Blast. However, when it dies, it shoots out many cannon balls one by one in a very rapid manner. the cannon balls dont land randomly, they target brawlers or pets.
---
Only the sniper bot attacks you
---
It‚Äôs ROB (gasp)

I mean, I hate siege and only play solo showdown, but I respect players who can play different modes that others think are bad. Siege is a bit more complex than other game modes, which I feel like is a step in the right direction for supercell. The large trophy loss is annoying, but if you‚Äôre good enough it‚Äôs kinda fun sometimes. 
---
TL,DR: I agree

Flair does not check out.

I dont hate on comics featuring mortis

Awesome! I actually just had an idea for a brawler named Robb (I thought I'd keep up the 4 letter naming scheme). I'm nowhere near as good at drawing as you, but hopefully I can sketch something up!
---
Btw This is not the only map with this bug .Kaboom Kanyon in Heist
---
I don‚Äôt like brawl ball either; it‚Äôs just full of tanks all the time.
---
Can I buy this???
---
Say F to (not to the IKE for respect)the robot causing the IKE to die from BO's mines!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
Its literally impossible to get a kill from far range using auto aim with piper
---
Pancho !
---
I know you will get a legendary, unlike me, but isn't it taking for you much because you have so many trophies. But I wish you best of luck!
---
Yes,yes
---
His star power should be when someone is inside him they get damaged
---
Lmaooooo! Take my upvote!
---
Siege is waaaaayyy too complicated for a beginner to figure out. Plus, it would be confusing if a newbie played gem grab the first time and the next day it was siege.
---
Wow
---
If this doesn't work, you owe me 14 boxes and 2 Big ones
---
I don‚Äôt know how many XP would it take to this step, but I think it‚Äôs above 120. Maybe 200? Idk
---
I can assure that this isn't stolen
---
How did you that
---
Go to this website- [pixelcrux.com](https://pixelcrux.com) and select Brawl map designer.
---
Not a star power, but add combo supers to the game.
---
Like the previous post where gene and carl use their supers to deflect each other, but more sensible.
---
This would definitely make the game mechanics more interesting.
---
It's only an idea, I don't say to be added, but this was made for fun!
---
Glad you liked it :-D
---
Gedi-Kor is an exception. He has the power. (I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm talking)
---
Are the new 4 skins permanent or just temporary? How about maple barley skin?
---
Bold and brash... With an umbrella
---
Shelly: Shelly's pellets spread out more  but still the same amount of pellets.
---
Nita: Nita's bear's stats all increase by 10 percent
---
No wonder why it was called PIPER Perri lmao
---
learnt it from bull, lol
---
Excuse me what the fuck
---
I had a same kind of ending, but worse. Our lvl ~20 siege bot was already in the enemy base, but our third player stepped in bo's mines in base after respawning, so we lost like this. I even told my friend not walk over the base because of them, but our random was unaware. Too bad it was below 400 trophys so no playback.
---
That bounce pad tho
---
Bro dyna-jump is super useful

I am not crying, it's just raining through my eyes!

I would really appreciate a 3D animation or video like this. Since fan made animations are mostly like cartoon drawings or anime, if you turn something legit like this into an animation you would get a lot of support. Like the art keep it up it looks like it‚Äôs straight from the headquarters.

Hello friend, today I am about to post your idea, but I will change the stun with 80% slowness since it would be OP for Brawlers to not be able to hit!

Bull sucks, he might deal good damage woth good health but after that all the bad things start short range and little damage from far away, if you wanna play z tank im heist, play rosa if you wanna bushcamp in showdown, play shelly, if you wanna play brawl ball, shelly or rosa, if you wanna play gemgrab, rosa!

---
Most of game mode main objective isn't about killing. Adding K/D will make some player obsessed to get a kill.
---
This problem also happen in other MOBA. Where the main objective is to destroy enemy turret and base. But there is a lot of player who just chasing for kill all the time because they KDA will shown in they profile.

The new brawler coming in the June update... ...
---
Even Duo Showdown can‚Äôt save you

She would‚Äôve done 599.4 damage ungrounded so I‚Äôm confused too. Shouldn‚Äôt she have done 599

When there are 2 people left , the healing mushrooms  spawn more on the center ....

iS tHaT aLl?

Even if the skins were discounted, I still can‚Äôt buy them, so it makes no difference for me

*The whole community is Crying
---
Yeah, I'm guessing it rounded the numbers up before calculating the damage reduced:
---
1% of 999 is 9.99 and then it just rounded 9.99 to 10, multiplied by 40, and got 400 less damage

never used piper in this mode

 Carl was built to help Dynamike underground, as they both mine and collect gems. Leon is part of the same tribe as Bo and Nita because they all have some sort of animal persona and animal abilities tied to it. I wasn‚Äôt sure at first because Leon has a hoodie, but after they remodeled Bo and he has a baseball cap, I‚Äôm certain.
---
That could work

How would they change it ?????
---
First, you didn't talked with the developers, just with a random dude working at Support that will always tell you go post it here.
---
The power cubes spawn in a slight different point to make each match different and not being g always the same. It has always been like that and won't be changed
---
No, kid, they won't add something to change the graphics, it is a stupid idea and they won't add it
---
Matchmaking doesn't use levels, and it won't change. Get over it, matchmaking is fine
---
I‚Äôd get Leon as well from another box then ! xD
---
Just now read the post dipshit lol happens almost everygame in duos what you mean. Might not be a Shelley but its a problem and you're just sounding autistic so goodbye lol

just decrease her attack range then everything will be ok

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presumption_of_innocence
---
"The presumption of innocence is the legal principle that one is considered innocent unless proven guilty. It was traditionally expressed by the Latin maxim ei incumbit probatio qui dicit, non qui negat (‚Äúthe burden of proof is on the one who declares, not on one who denies‚Äù).
---
In many states, presumption of innocence is a legal right of the accused in a criminal trial, and it is an international human right under the UN's Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 11. Under the presumption of innocence, the legal burden of proof is thus on the prosecution, which must collect and present compelling evidence to the trier of fact. The trier of fact (a judge or a jury) is thus restrained and ordered by law to consider only actual evidence and testimony presented in court. The prosecution must, in most cases prove that the accused is guilty beyond reasonable doubt. If reasonable doubt remains, the accused must be acquitted."
---
that's brock
---
Wowzers
---
I... actually love and appreciate this meme for what it is
---
Thank you!:)
---
I disagree with Mortis. I don‚Äôt think he was created
---
But spike has to be rosas kid
---
Fake unless the mortis was standing still
---
Then you gotta get used to and learn to throw it a few inches ahead of you. It‚Äôs radius is large and will likely get the person. However the chances of that killing your follower is unlikely because they are likely gonna be a tank of somesort
---
Your post says [Deleted]
---
That should show you how shitty your post and idea was, maybe as shitty as you. Now keep crying, they won't change it.
---
Not simpler than 80 fucking gems white crow...
---
No clue whatsoever. Maybe because Supercell thinks that above 400 trophies, there are  skillful players and worthy of a replay
---
Except piper in robo rumble...
---
Stop reposting it
---
Yeah!üòÖwe were lucky that we found a team like that.
---
You could be lagging. I know it sounds dumb but believe me, sometimes i lag really hard in a high service area or my house
---
But it would still be nice to show some epic plays from whatever trophy amount there is.
---
Since we talking about channels
---
Any recommendations on chaanel that does guides or in general is informative.

Cool and all, but no upvote because night witch mortis is a nono

The luck system is random you cant do anything exept opening boxes you cant control to get a legendary

Every brawl stars players dream is to have a 0,5% change to get a legendary :D

People are saying Meteor Shower is bad but the only reason Angry Robot isnt getting that much hate is because it only affects one person at a time when Meteors can Spawn to someone else after they spawn near you

---
Yeah and , I just started in reddit . How do I put the brawler you have next to your username ? Please bro
---
I was thinking more on the lines of movement speed. Movement speed same as bibi‚Äôs sp or maybe even faster? Let him be known for his uptimate mobility. Either that or he could use any of the stat buff. Speaking of which, rey‚Äôs streaming(pushing mortis to 700)
---
This posts are so repetitive. We understand the game is luck based know can you stop complaining. Supercell can't do anything about it because it's not a problem to the game. The whole system of getting new brawlers is luck based.
---
What was their reply?
---
Rosa Made Spike
---
Thx this is my firts time around reddit btw!
---
Yeah
---
Not my fault ur unlucky
---
I laughed too hard at that :D

He‚Äôs supposed to be a llama but he could be an alpaca too

There are so many other people like him who are just disgusting people get banned for their name being ‚ÄúA$$‚Äù but then his name is far more discriminating then the people with the name I just mentioned, it‚Äôs so annoying I still don‚Äôt understand how he didn‚Äôt get banned ahead of time.üò§üò§üò§ü§¨ü§¨

Let me put this out, crow can be a pet of a family, and spike could be adopted by rosa or just a cactus  that she cut and used for her gloves

Noob za boi you are

I bought this skin too... kurwa

I usually seek out the robot, free cubes bruh.

Josh could‚Äôve put on friendly games

yeah, her and Mortis
---
No problem!
---
I think I‚Äôve made some of these thumbnails into reality...
---
Hah! Sorry! I would never use that ugly Mortis in game
---
it's a skin for the fan made brawler created by u/phlorpe
---
wot.
---
Ummmmm this is an image he stole from an NSFW bs website and made it SFW the reality is that scrappy is sucking .........
---
You know you know
---
Do he gonna steal heart of teamer or somethin ?! X)
---
Cool drawing dude
---
Thanks! I think I need to change Mortis, Pam, and Poco
---
I heard the music in my mind brain.
---
Nah Poco is ok ;)
---
Which kind of box was it? Mega box?
---
seriously though some primos are smart, like the ones that just don't play gem grab 
---
# and play brawl ball instead lol
---
Yep. She's my favorite drawing
---
Really neat map and we would see long range brawlers on this. I would suggest adding a ring of bushes around the gem opening. I think this would balance long range and close-quarter brawlers.
---
I purposely trigger them. They are almost definitely going to go off might as well make sure they don‚Äôt go off in middle of a fight

Yea I totally agree. But I think it‚Äôs two-fold. I‚Äôve noticed that pattern too, but also noticed one after spending even .99 cents; right after I did, opened up a small box and hit with an epic brawler. I was only curious to see if anyone has noticed this as well
---
Awesome!
---
I know thatüåö
---
This is stolen from an NSFW website and he made it SFW the reality is that scrappy is sucking jessie's......
---
Yeah to be continued

I understood you thanks but... How lesbians connected with this mode üòÑ

Just ban teammers

I think you do need to elaborate I see nothing wrong with this. Just an ordinary box for People under 1000 trophies

Thats not what he wants, trust me

Holy Crap That's Insane so so so good

1.Crow is a legendary and not a rare brawler.
---
2.If you have Crow, you are luckily enough
---
just saying this is a bot game

you clound make bibi s bat

Well if someone does get past the security, like using "@" instead of "a" than you have to report them manually
---
Jep

They had us in the first half, not gonna lie.
---
Now I will upvote
---
Or next to the brawl box
---
My friend saw me get crow, and he told me its a rare brawler and that theres a 2 percent chance of getting it, he might have been lying though
---
Ayy nice
---
Well maxing brawlers is based on how long you have been playing. Also shows you opened a lot of chests if they are maxed and then would most likely have a legendary. I have every brawlers, maxed out, but I had basically every brawler maxed before getting my first legendary.
---
She is 17

Hey are you the one who stole the NSFW image and made it SFW?

You know what I don't care.

You wont lose your trophies except when the season resets. But only those who has brawler at 502+ loses trophys when the season resets
---
Or at least 30 gem ones
---
Hmmmmmm *angry creature of the night  noises*??????
---
tiTTle
---
I might be dumb but how did you make the match allow duplicate brawlers
---
Minecraft barrel is way more op
---
It‚Äôs entirely possible for someone to draw in different styles. It‚Äôs not like artists have to be married to one specific style. We can‚Äôt really assume it‚Äôs stolen since there is no evidence to prove so.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs the one
---
5v5 anyone?

**Give this fella gold for its efford and awesome job**

She is free, I didn‚Äôt have to spend a single gem to unlock her

Ok

They always do it tho

Mortis... is immortal!
---
Anything can be a good idea, I personally like the old Rico for how his golden skin looked and I like the old Bo because i have played the old model a ton and it really grew on me. And your welcome
---
I said "Great idea!" What else am I suppose to say? His rework idea is amazing, no complaints. I chose to continue discussing Carl.
---
well well well...bro if you are a teamer just put a dynamike flair. üëèTeamingüëèisüëèaidsüëè
---
yeah but many people, including me, like the old ones, and perhaps they could make more modern old ones? not like a remodel just smoother and stuff. Thoughts?
---
I hate you
---
Wait I thot is the golden boi.
---
the bear looks scary af

What did the comment say?

Sadly He has been remodeledüòÇ

Heh, Sorry

I knowüòÇ

 But I do not know how to speak English, I'm from Brazil, so what I wrote now might be wrong, I still have not learned English
---
Oof Bo hasn't had a remodel yet.
---
That would have been real bad if there wasn't that first sentence. Batrix is awful. Just watch one of his videos.
---
Sure! It'll probably take a couple days, but that's a good idea!

I wish I could give more upvotes amazing work this looks so epic

Ohh if u look videos before global update, it is too easy: tap the ready button and brawler at the same time.
---
Clean them up they are delicious... Teamers are always Leon‚Äôs food
---
I don't know man. I was trying to draw a new pose and I thought it was a great idea to draw Penny in a normal human size dynamically (by dynamically I mean miving towards a the camera or from the camera).
---
Yes the thighs on the right side is big because I inteded to maks it closer to the camera. This my first time drawing like this and I didn't get it right at all. I messed it up. It hurts that I put too much work then the whole thing is ruined.
---
why does this have upvotes , it is literally stolen.
---
That would be a good skin
---
Absolutely fantastic
---
It's just discussion.  Looks like blue team might have a slight advantage as they can get cover in the side bushes quicker.  I'm not saying you did a bad job or anything.  No offense intended.  Looks like you could just swap the jump pads on one of the sides to make symmetrical.
---
Again, I don't think it's a bad map.  I quite like it and that's why I'm interested in discussing it.  Nice map
---

It's to prevent people from quitting midgame and getting rewarded for doing so. It sucks, but it's a good system.
