It‚Äôs a good concept but if this is implemented they might as well just give us a max brawler to begin with
---
I get you
---
I agree, I don‚Äôt think this alone decides your skill but I was just going off what you were saying about being unskilled if a shelly supers near boxes. I think a skilled shelly wouldn‚Äôt do that, but just cuz you don‚Äôt do it, doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre unskilled

Crow/Penny: Lets camp in here!

Basically, it was a Drake meme.
---
Saying that Supercell don't do weekly updates,with new skins and game modes. 
---
And prefer to make a update each 3 months.
---
There was something more, but it was so shit, that I already forgot.
---
And like, what? Weekly updates? It would be so buggy.. Not to mention that, it isn't a easy thing to do
---
Its fair they still have same trophies
---
Can you send a link for it and is it free? 
---
I mean each team is about 250 trophies so that‚Äôs pretty fair. 
---
People who say*
---
None taken! Most of my brawlers are level 7+ and I like others a lot more than Darrel. I guess it's because I have options.
---
Yea but the disconnect is so large :P
---
Lol frl
---
Pretty much the whole game took place in that one spot believe it or not, but to me it sounds like you can't do it that's why you're sitting here arguing.

If this was put into effect it would make certain brawlers (e.g. Tara) completely useless. If you‚Äôre in gem grab a lot of times Tara saves the game last minute thanks to a calculated Super. If everyone knows Tara needs 1-2 hits to charge her super then it would make the enemies stay back. I‚Äôd only agree with your own team knowing how much you have to charge your super but personally I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a good addition. Also it would lead to your own team mates finding more stuff to be mad for. 
---
‚ÄúBro you could have shot at the other enemy just to charge your super and then use it on the other brawler‚Äù 
---
Just doesn‚Äôt seem right.

Can there be buildings? But old and western

I think it's because frank's super have 2 things combined, a damage wave and a stun mechanic. For some reason when mortis dashed only one of them hit while the other didn't register, could be because he started the dash inside the attack and ended outside the attack.

Colt got that Kikkoman. Picked up his Chinese New year's fit as well

I don‚Äôt think any have been confirmed yet. But there‚Äôs a chance piper will since frank stated she‚Äôd be getting one in the next couple of updates.

Bo is also an option, but no confirmation yet. (Should happen though... I mean look at him)

And that‚Äôs really the only ones I can think of. But the brawl team did say that everyone will be getting a remodel.

What were poco and darryls star powers like before the revamp?
---
maybe the trophie road could contain gems

Get good

I used piper and carried my team against a bull, primo, and shelly \*flex\*
---
Ohh come on, do you think the fat Bull will be able to pass from that one tile gap?
---
Both
---
Everyone already has all the legendaries that high, actually, but yes the rewards should be better along the whole trophy road
---
Cool idea, but what do you get for being the target?
---
That person should stop using piper for a while
---
No difference to me from brawler ball and capture the flag except I think you are required to retain your own flag in order to score?
---
I have come across a few that scores for my team of me and 2 randoms lol. Own goal 
---
Darryl's shield activated WHILE he was rolling, now it activates after he's done rolling. Poco exploded when he died and any friendly Brawler caught in the explosion healed for 1000 health.
---
There‚Äôs different types of capture the flag. I would like to see multiple types in brawlstars. One with a central flag and one with two flags one per team!
---
Something is
---
*o f f*

At first I thought it was for darryl‚Äôs roll

Then realised is what map it was

Seems like an interesting game. Kinda seems hard to win by killing the cannon don‚Äôt you think tho.

Exactly the point. We want new members of r/mortisgang to recognize our default skin.

You‚Äôll get mortis.

Well sorry

Happy KAKE day!!!

Yeah now I know he heals himself as well lol. Thanks tho!
---
Ikr? Crispy rice is an extremely vulgar name 
---
For every box you open that doesn't have a new brawler, your Legendary chance increases. If you go long enough without unlocking a new brawler, your Legendary chance will be so high that you'll be more likely getting a Legendary than a Mythic.
---
Happens every time 
---
Good one!
---
Uhhh...
---
You should do a lizard that grows into a Godzilla like monster with his super or a gorilla model like rampage
---
Is the lvl 50 gem deal worth it?
---
I live in Asia so it took longer haha
---
The way the primo walks up to you LMAO
---
I wish!
---
Remember, it‚Äôs your total trophies now, not just that certain brawlers trophy level
---
Oh dear, and here I thought I found a new and unique glitch 
---
Yeah, i saw a play when a crow autoaimed a super to a bull, and he wasn't moving, none of the daggers hit so he instantly died.
---
Looks like a scuffed Pok√©mon lol
---
You WHAT!?
---
btw number 18 is false, Corner Case went live for 20 minutes or so iirc immediately before the launch of Excel as a bounty map.

Shes 10
---
Oke
---
Nope

Art.
---
Nah i tried with a max tara once, if you super a wall the shadow wont spawn in the hole just created, you need 2 supers, one for the hole and one for the shadow itself
---
Best group selfie taken by Leon
---
Poco‚Äôs eyes are kinda off but great job man üëç
---
Well if the crow lands directly in the centre of the opponents hit box; the daggers will surely miss, duno why 
---
Awwww, thats so sweer! 
---
ravioli, ravioli, dont lewd the forest loli
---
I like the idea to give back resources to the target after a kill, but I feel like a full clip is a lot. Since the other 3 players won‚Äôt necessarily be working perfectly together, giving the target 3 bullets will in most situation allow him (or her) to simply win 3 1v1s. I would personally make it so you gain back 1 bullet per kill just so we don‚Äôt see stuff like auto aim Shelly‚Äôs just shooting 9 shoots and 3 supers in 2 sec.
---
yeah i thought it was only a dress bc of her amazon jungle theme
---
Can we all agree that piper needs a buff and gene needs a nerf
---
Um Leon lvl 8 at 0 trophies
---
Yeah, supercell should try to fix those things.

Imagine how they all felt

This is a really fun map... when nobody plays bull... otherwise Tara is meta

At least you didn't get him at 876 trophies like my classmateüëç

She already deals more damage than brock with bigger hitbox and faster travel speed, plus her ult is pretty much get out of jail free.

Piper is fine imo.

I still haven‚Äôt got mine , when did u get urs tried contacting but they keep closing conversation

FLY FREE MY TITTIES!
---
His range is ridiculously long, i mean if his shot is going to spread at the las moment why not make the range shorter 
---
Just want to add: It is ESPECIALLY crucial in Brawl Ball. Knowing who has their Super ready or nearly ready can make the difference between scoring or not since you would want to pass to the correct teammate.
---
For a start it‚Äôs not matched on power (unfortunately).  My last attack was bounty. 414(7), 287(8), 287/(7) vs 404(6), 425(10), 372(10). I disagree, the matchmaking hasn‚Äôt improved. Also, previously got my power 2 piper to 420 trophies, now that she‚Äôs power 5 I‚Äôm actually down to 350 trophies, I‚Äôm always the lowest power and health in showdown... I hate trophy match making, P2W.
---
I‚Äôve had teammates like you and it makes me want to uninstall. Seriously, get good.
---
I think they say it is based on total trophies but I don't think so
---
I don't think Leon is the son, cause Bo and Nita are from urban tribes. And also I ship Nita and Leon . ;)
---
BUFF TARA.
---
And double shelly is too unfair
---
Damn nice
---
Spotlight uh moonlight uh
---
rico would be really good here
---
Thx. Even though  with terrible  aim
---
There will for sure be spots where using your shots on enemies chasing you is more cost effective. In those case, you just have to hope no one is bush camping on your exit route. 
---
But most cases, you should invest that ammo to check bushes, I think you won't regret making that change!
---
And the next time I ever got a new brawler was at 6.4k
---
Is based on the trophies of the highest brawler in the room
---
Yesssssss
---
Followed by his friend "Pairy Henis"?
---
Alot have changed in a couple of months, haven' it?
---
Taller tho
---
So if I'm not mistaken, the joke is just that someone thought a Darryl was a Frank, and thats it..?
---
I never checked my chances before but on gene I time noted my early chance and checked after opening 35 brawl boxes and unlocked 1 epic brawler I found my legendary chance dropped
---
I don't play cr anymore is that again in shop or old image
---
Chief pat has the habit of calling Darrly, a Frank
---
I do this when im not in a lust for gems
---
Almost 100% sure me or my friend has played with ‚ÄúIs Ginny Thicc?‚Äù
---
Total trophies of the brawlers in the team(I think) 
---
Better to have powerpoints between 50 and 200 than always 200, no ?
---
"Brawl Starts"
---
Nope, because you could play like one 500 brawler and a have a pro player that made a new account to help you and you match 250 people, now they slove it and is like i said
---
Taller and smarter 
---
We got you!

Wow gg man...
---
Legendary chances gets as high as the mythic chances
---
I wasnt refering to the qualities of the brawlers i know they are all good either way. But for me its p2w to get all coins and tokens to upgrade your brawlers (buying chests) for me it should be just skins that could be bought with real money. Btw epics are not that uncommon? The chance of getting one is by around 0,5472% thats even worse than the fifa packweight lol
---
When you are annoyed by this but are an equal part of the issue
---
But can he do this? I don't think so
---
Multiple types would probably not be the best idea because it would confuse new players but maby later when the game is more mature.

I do this every time with Penny, brawlers Will hit the Box instead of me, Accept for area damage

We always had this kind of complaints in all SC games and we also always had to explain why levels should not matter in matchmaking

I find that the star powers are easy to get in lower trophies 
---
But you teamed with the mushrooms hypocrite
---
Who else misses the old darryl? 
---
This is beyond science
---
I see.. Yeah tokens are actually very worth. Esp when you get so much from a game when doubled, it's satisfying!

I had one match that the opponent was able to bring to a tie at 1% at the last minute. I was shocked and impressed.
---
You are goddamn right

And you were acting as though you were representing the community when you said people more pps in the beginning of the trophy road and less as they go along, making it seem as though 6k was a ‚Äúhigh‚Äù trophy amount... actually, people need less of them in the beginning (0-2.5k), more pps in the middle (2.6k-8k), and less towards the end of the trophy road (9k+). 
---
What's wrong with this pic? 
---
I want that in the game is super awsome
---
I think Corner Case has been out once. Im glad that Hot Maze isn't in circulation tbh
---
It would be a fun mode ... but that cannot win and lose trophies. Maybe it can reward another thing. Like a special event mode or something
---
Stop talking about buffing crow, its just annoying. We get it crow needs a buff you aren‚Äôt the first post saying that
---
Nice Idea! I really love it!
---
I think we wanna see more Leons and any kind of 'jumpers' to avoid attacks and survive more time...
---
I found this funny for some reason lol
---
Gene is Tara's genie
---
Not really. This sub had the weakest memes of all. 
---
r/meruem would this be a ticketed mode? I would love this to be a trophy pushing mode as well!
---
And it could have their hp and super meter as rings around it
---
I mean Hot Maze doesn't look great but why make it to not put it in rotation, I want to at least try it out, toy know
---
"BuG fIx It SuPerCelL"
---
Well, pretty much 90% of this subreddit is about buffing crow and it‚Äôs just as infuriating for us that crow is so weak like it is for you too not understand a joke as well as not as understanding that we need to gather as much attention as we can to get supercell to buff crow.
---
Also, if you had crow yourself you‚Äôd understand what we‚Äôre saying.
---
Good answer.
---
I have no mythics no Frank and no crow or leon
---
You said you saw it... You should still say that it's not by you. Don't make excuses.
---
Yeah well heck you could put ‚ÄúCrow is good‚Äù in here and OH IF YOU HAVE A LOT OF SKILL YOU CAN PLAY HIM would still apply
---
Because of the use of Gene's pose you get my upvote

Trust me, you don't.

Shame. SHAME.
---
Looks to me like that Map was intended for portrait view instead of landscape.
---
It's an old map, in other words, and without a remake it won't be back in the game.
---
Maybe make it for who deals more damage to the target? 
---
Loool 
---
he‚Äôs really good once you know how to ise bim
---
don't forget to rename bounty to piper+brock mode. 
---
it's the single bounty map where shotgunners work still gets so much hate.

OP people leave the ball in the field till the other teams dead and then score. Would be pointless to watch a ball sitting there doing nothing with that camera option lol

that's because you are poor f2p and can't buy skins. caped primo is so much better than most brawlers .

Where's the El Primo jumping into the opponents with 10 gems?

Thx!!! i am the creator and i apreciate ure detail

With you have a Bo with star power that is strong
---
This is literally snake prairie but with "Darryl" written all over it. 
---
That‚Äôs funny coming from an el primo
---
then don't.  what's the point of buying if you can't upgrade.  it will still be stuck at lvl 7. when you get some less amount of points then buy it.

That dyna in the top booked himself a nice ticket into second place

Why did Penny keep moving up?

Yup. That left a mark in my memory

I have a 0.06

you have the face the direction whatever side you're jumping on .. if you're on the left side of the dynamite face left and you'll jump far ..
---
Why the tape.

Still,you would just more likely to lose trophy that way.And you can just play other brawler in other moose.

I'm pretty sure there is a difference between 12 and 171 and with the new matchmaking it takes into account total trophies

Wow that's so lucky

just get triple kills lmao

Robowars is a new mode that was leaked, not robo rumble

But I'm mortis gang

I think we can expect robo wars this weekend or the next!

You‚Äôve earned my downvote

I see a broken phone

Thats when you switch what you‚Äôre following. Different options for different matches

thank !!

go and look at the leaderboards for gene players

Robo wars is a new gamemode that was leaked.
---
Bringer of doom
---
It's probably gem grab, but it can be a new gamemode
---
Eh no.
---
That's funny coming from a shelly

Would be awesome game mode if it could let you make coins lol
---
Wow wht mode did u push it. I pushed my power 1 gene to 340 only

The art work is really well done. üëåüî•
---
Robo wars isn't finished yet, it's still in development it will probably be released in the next update.
---
Biggest noob Leon I‚Äôve ever seen
---
Matchmaking is based more heavily on higher trophies. That means lower trophies is less likely to pull the enemy trophies down. So it really is working as intended.
---
i see a toxic guy
---
Or maybe it's a re-skin of gem grab?
---
Who knows.
---
Tara and penny is not too bad in this map. I pushed my tara to 490 in this map . 
---
Well,fun fact.They did.And I saw both of them got kill by a shelly with energy drink.
---
No 
---
Just no
---
Thank you, fellow creature of the night.
---
I believe that at some point they should start doing that to make the rest of characters more eye catching 
---
Everytime I've lost in this match it's been to a team with Jessie.  Jessie's also pretty decent on this map (with good teammates) due to her tracking shot as well as her tracking super.  
---
Lmfao
---
Matchmaking is supposed to match you with similar individual brawler trophies, not based on power level.
---
How you get the picture 
---
Nice gameplay!
---
Shelly doesn't deserve it. :(

EEEEEL PRIMPPPPP
---
mortis ganggg
---
I wanted customisation options for each brawler, 
---
There is no point ever for a dynamike to use auto-aim (maybe with the exception of the crate in solo) 
---
but i realised when running away i kept trying to drop the dynamite on my feet but due to not moving too far thought i auto aim 
---
Auto aim through where the enemy was, who was chasing me which means it missed them 
---
Id much much much prefer for dynamike and barley that tapping the attack button would aim at their feet instead of auto 
---
but obviously might as well keep auto for say bull. 
---
That template is finnaly used!
---
You‚Äôre at 400 trophies I‚Äôd love to see a replay (plos)
---
My friend got Spike at roughly 800 trophies
---
No you were just aiming it the wrong direction. 
---
There is no bull tutorial? nvm, youll probably start in that one bounty map

Yesterday I went into solo showdown with Jessie, (380 trophies) and the other 9 people were Shelly.

Needless to say I literally got fucked

Idk if this is a joke or not i can't tell

If you guys remember, at the community round table a while ago, Ryan mentioned tara skins specifically a mummy or one where they change her star power shadow to like a spider or something like that. I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôre working on a skin. Patience is a virtue
---
Cool!
---
Artifact is something i haven‚Äôt seen before. Coin Rush is Gem Grab, Attack and Defend is Heist, Survival and Battle Royale is Showdown. Wanted is Bounty, Laserball is BrawlBall.

Hmmmm wait a minute your not a mortis

*GET HIM CREATURES OF THE NIGHT*
---
ever realised bo is not a bird?
---
Now that's hot
---
Frank is one of the best brawlers... Especially in solo/duo showdown.
---
But who is he hitting tho?
---
it still takes piper 2.3 seconds to reload.
---
Bo isn't no skill whatsoever 
---
Don't ever say that to my favorite brawler 
---
His star power isn't ridiculous anymore
---
Those maps aren't permanently gone
---
They will come back like what stromy plains did
---
Hmm. I'm sorry, I can't help then. It always works for me.
---
It‚Äôs under Gene. 
---
Is a game, if you cant, play something else
---
Maybe try pressing random issues until you can choose to answer "Did we answer all..." NO.
---
And then spike and a primo and penny poos out,and u like,aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah.
---
I disagree with many of these (Ill edit soon with details)
---
Thanks for The wallpaper 
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure they are random
---
Don‚Äôt waste money on games
---
Thanks mate
---
Wow. Just wow.
---
Frank is great until about 300 when people just keep their distance when you have your super and he becomes useless in most gamemodes. 
---
He‚Äôs good in brawl ball, but yeah, definitely one of the weaker brawlers as is.
---
One the plus side his level hardly matters as it‚Äôs all about his super, so getting a low level frank to 500 is just as doable as a max frank.
---
You mean two different players' shop might have different Special Offers?
---
That's how Piper works
---
That's exactly what I'm talking about. It's not quite as bad with Barley since his AOE is instant after impact, but it's really frustrating to play Dynamike since his damage is on a delay. It won't allow you to drop dynamite near his feet at all, and the explosion is on a delay, so you're pretty much screwed if anyone gets close.
---
I also wouldn't mind the option to disable auto aim in general for everyone. Instead, I think it'd be cool if your attack would go in the direction you're facing when you quick fire.  I think this would also be a slight nerf to shot-gunners/bush campers, which is needed imo.  And then of course throwers should be able to drop the attack at their feet.
---
uh what? his selection of brawlers is just scrolled down lol...
---

This is so sad, can we get an F in the chat

I didn't have to state it as a joke. It was obvious you must be stupid. Being at 4.5 k is shit I was 5k in 3 and half weeks. I can draw better but why would I?
---
*BANG BANG* FBI, OPEN UP
---
MM doesnt look at lvl power and stuff.. the real question is who waits to max a brawler before he uses them.
---
The game is already incredibly balanced. Putting in these changes would render Frank and Darryl utterly useless. Most of these changes are just unnecessary.

Leon gang has an alliance with Dynamikes gang

Yea it's called robo wars

I don't know how but I accidentally replied to the wrong comment. I agree with you in that aiming ahead of you only works in certain scenarios. It would be much easier to have the option to drop attacks at your feet. I hate auto aim across the board.

---
1. Supercell should fix that as fast as possible! It makes no sense for auto-aim to prioritize an inoffensive target, like a Power Box. A Power Box should be prioritized over an enemy only if it's twice as close as the enemy.
---
2. It also makes no sense to keep a broken feature in the game. Either fix it or remove it.
---
3. [THIS POST](https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/arypej/when_shelly_autoaims/) isn't about Shelly being "unskilled", it's about auto-aim being an **unreliable, broken feature.**
---
4. Fixing auto-aim doesn't make the game easy. To reach high trophies, you need to aim manually, predicting where the enemy will be. Auto-aim doesn't do that and it never should. Auto-aim should stay as a feature for close range fight and for begginers, making it easy to start playing Brawl Stars with Shelly, El Primo or Bull.

i got frank today. sadly dont have tara or gene

4100 and still no new brawler. When 15 out of 15 friends are 2000 below me and still have at least one epic, I think this counts as unlucky

Oh go fu** yourself kid if you think thats a part of the game

I have 6.6 and i dont have any epics or mythics. Only have spike

Yes i agree with u

---
Thx mate

Underated comment üòÇ

Theyre salty bc they cant get legendaries

I understand that bro. I only say new Brock is shit compared to the old design. Im talking in visual therms of course. Look at that boss

I vaguely know what MC Bed Wars is, but yeah that's right. 
---
Upon leaving the chat, remember to say "Ah, Banana oil"
---
Its not a strategy!!!!! Its aids thats all betraying teamers is a strategy to learn idiots not to team
---
IMO one thing they really need to do to improve retention is provide a game mode or option (NOT FRIENDLY/PRIVATE ROOMS) to play with random that's strictly fun/casual and not competitive. There comes a point for everyone where you plateau in trophies and in significantly reduces playing time because you don't want to lose trophies.
---
It's just ironic to me that the better you are and the more you play the more you're likely to get severely punished. 
---
By the looks of it, all the brawlers are in order of when they were released (except the originals), but then gene is in front of Leon even though he came out after. Was gene planed on being released before Leon at first?
---
Or when the opponent is low health the shot goes to any other direction.
---
I still don‚Äôt understand why they removed that from the description box.
---
Totally agreed, see this is the smartest man in the comments

How does this affect gameplay

... It doesn‚Äôt?

Actually this use to be pocos star power until supercell changed it cause it was useless soo
---
I'd prefer no legendaries but all epics and mythics, i have only 17 brawlers :p
---
Goals living that tough life together

If we're going this way loosing the shield if you grab the ball would seem logical to me.
---
Holy hand grenades
---
No u

this doesnt even happen lol

Cause they're trash and they can't kill you with skill. I respect your attitude and you would've definitely won the battle if it were only one of them. I know this is useless but we must stopthespin.

Feel like new accounts have better luck imo.  23/23 and got spike on an alt account with less than 800 trophies...

Can you be more clear how this breaks the rule? I don‚Äôt get how this post with the same format: https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/asccm7/and_stay_down/?st=JSCEKA1V&amp;sh=85a6ef86, stays up yet mine with a different punchline gets removed.

Have you ever tried make a team with brasilians
---
What, do you mean the star power then yes, it is for maxed players.
---
*downvotes me* 
---
When the bull spam his ulti to run but he can't :(
---
game is more fun on top ladder, but you have to play hardcore and learn meta and stuff. if you play casual ofc its funnier vs noobs :)
---
This happens to me too pretty much I have to tell my teammate to camp in the corner of the map until 3 teams are left so we don‚Äôt lose trophies 
---
all of your art is so perfect i love it. clean lines, none of the clay colors bled into each other. amazing! 
---
Same idea...
---
Can‚Äôt a dynamike theoretically kill a mortis using star power though?

Very cool
---
Well that's a screenshot "/
---
That could just be team repositioning. I don't see how it really is teaming
---
"Ah, this lamp will be a fine addition to my collection." Love the art!
---
Or they could tighten the drop rates for beginners a bit and take the game back to what it was when it first started - Be happy with what ya got 
---
What are you on about? Yes you can.
---
They were walking along with each other, not even trying to shoot or avoid each other
---
Pro brawl league, all the best of the best players play professionally for prize money there. 
---
Shoot-didn't send the image
---
Hell yes!!
---
I was also thinking of making his star power for his bat and ball, but thought it might be better for him to have ome for a jet pack. It would have been called "homerun" and he would stun the player who was hit with the ball at max range, also causing a bit of damage.
---
You don't know how many times I tried to smash my phone or abuse it. 
---
Same. I have a lot of technical problems with Brawl Stars, but I love the game :).
---
Sure
---
But Shellys never miss, A U T O A I M 
---
Owen back at it again with the map ideas! Great as always!
---
r/ShellyGang
---
Thanks! This one I‚Äôm kind of iffy about just because of the amount of bushes, but I think it would be a really unique idea!
---
Idk if it's still possible but if you invite someone (you gotta be in a duo showdown room not trophie puhsing room idek what you wanna call it) and then move another person to the slot where you invited the person and the person you invited accept the invite BAMM 3 player team :)
---
For another customer and for glory
---
Lol
---
I‚Äôm at 10.5 without one....
---
Well, it caught the crow by surprise at the least. And 90 IQ is close to retarded. 
---
I‚Äôve done that before but I thought it was patched.
---
HOLY CRAP THIS IS AMAZING! Love it so much! Take my upvote and silver!

---

---
Thb if I bought an epic and it's a mythtic, I would be happy.
---
I wrote stats and it auto corrected, whoops
---
Its PURfect!
---
That sounds good. I was thinking in 1v1 situations...but that sounds helpful. I guess I prefer him to be more offensive since he‚Äôs an assassin...
