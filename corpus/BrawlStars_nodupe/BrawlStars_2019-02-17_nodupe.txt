I agree, but they should've nerfed Jessie, Nita, and penny along with him, but since they didn't, these 3 Brawlers dominate big game as big brawler.

No no it should damage the ball instead

How hasnt anyone thought of this yet? It‚Äôs genius!

Also underrated post
---
I think maybe it's in relation to the number of boxes opened during the time Gene wasn't in the list.
---
I had 73 small boxes and 10 large ones.

Oh ok. I wouldn't mind having a casual mode but it definitely isn't *needed.* There are greater things that need to be added first.

---
Simple enough... don‚Äôt auto aim. Auto aim targets the nearest target so if thats the box, thats where it will shoot
---
I don't know why I'm getting downvoted but I really don't think crow is that underpowered at all. Since hitting daggers with him is so easy, he only needs to focus on dodging shots which is rather easy with his movement speed.
---
That old Colt tho lmao

Jessie too

The most lovely detail of this skin for me is that Bull's nose circlet is removed!

Fixing memory leak and bad matchmaking, and balancing Brawlers, takes a lot more time and effort than fixing a bug. They're definitely working on these things, it just takes time. They had a matchmaking fix a while ago, and it wasn't perfect but it certainly helped. And Leon will probably get another nerf next balance update.
---
Didn't expect that

Darryl in the next update.

Tara's head, Penny's hat, Pam's gun tip, and a Shelly body. I know that you can't draw and neither can I.. but I like the idea!

Then vortex super, followed by frank super  and mikes super. Whoever super.

If everyone saves their super and waits with Tara it's gg.

But most importantly

Yeah they do! I mentioned in a comment somewhere deep in this thread mentioning it won't really server a purpose since it's activatable from anywhere on their respective sides, but they can be used as a measurement to align different elements near the controls.

For example if you wanted to move your ultimate button closer to your attack button, etc..)

U made a brawler of one of my Club members? O_o

Thank you! :D
---
Memory leak? How you tell the game has memory leaks? In my experience the game doesn't get slower the more you play it. Or do they said that Gene's bug was caused by a memory leak? (I heard it was caused by a debug information they forgot to remove)
---
Mainly, you want to use long-range brawlers to explode the TNT and destroy enemy cover. Since there are two Mines, you want to be extra cautious, or else the other team may destroy you. Use medium-range brawlers mainly.
---

---
Hahahaha No Seriously it's my first time drawing her in her dragon knight skin
---
That sounds more balanced than the current configuration, tbh.
---
Nice. Hoping i get it from my next big box
---
She looks older
---
Kinda like the age of D.va from OW
---
It's actually just shelly's body, three of Penny's hats and the top of Pam's backpack with Penny's hat pit stylized on it. The idea is pretty old and most of these only get traction when there's art.

And with Green Nita's star power the bear moves really fast

How did the person's name appear over them as "Barry", but at the end it says "6ix9ine" killed you?

My brother who has 600 trophies told me he just got the cactus dude... I was like seriously

And I never use auto aim, only in these situations
---
Hey man, Youtubes claiming system is REALLY fu\*\*\*\* at the moment, people getting false claims left and right. Nonetheless, I wish you the best of luck and hope you recover from this quickly! (You've got good vids, you earned a sub from me)
---
I post on pixiv actually but I draw different things there unlike here in reddit, I only post brawlstars art
---
r/crow
---
Imo power is an indication of how strong the character is. And trophy count is an indication of how good the player is at playing that character. It's hard to strike a balance between those 2 to have a fair match making. 
---
For example, for a player with low trophy count but high power. It could be that he got lucky with brawl boxes, or he suck that much to tilt, it's pretty hard to factor in that to the algorithm. 
---
On the other hand, if a player is really good but have bad luck with brawl boxes. Does that mean he should continue to be teamed against less skilled players.
---
I only use auto aim in this situation, and it‚Äôs quicker to shoot in those situations, I just find it dumb why it would do that
---
Can‚Äôt imagine it‚Äôs an unpopular name
---
I mean, if he really wanted I‚Äôm sure he could get every brawler to 1000. He just needs to stop editing his yt videos and quit PBL, and he would have enough time. At the point we‚Äôre at it‚Äôs not skill holding us back but moreso time.

Spike puts amazing pressure on other people. He can hit behind walls, and slows people down

OH yes I should have specified that I bet only 2

They were like nah you got it

This is going to end up like League of Legends where everyone will be pinging the "?' ping at the El Primo flying in with 10 gems. Good idea tho

Yeah, that does sound quite nice. Sadly, though, I am not too good with replacing stuff with photo editing. These are also just concepts, after all. lol

I want the green Nita too

Would addan interesting dynamic for sure. No way to know if there is a brawler protecting the goal or not if he plays well.

Quick question, is there a birdie in that hat?

I play mostly Darryl on Double trouble, so i welcome teaming dynomikes, lolz. Teaming gets out of control some games where it becomes 9 and 10 players spinning with 12x12 squares left.

On the other hand the dude who's onto you is actually under the same circumstances as you too isn't it. He would've been hitting boxes if he was using auto aim. So it's pretty fair imo

1st place really doesn‚Äôt matter as you only get 1-2 more trophies than 2nd. So it really wouldn‚Äôt have been a big deal if you did win. I just go for 2nd-3rd but will go for a win if I can. 
---
dude who says anything about it being 40 boxes? THAT argument is flawed, I was using Hearthstone as an example. It could be a fair number Supercell could determine. Right now there are people who have played since the game was soft launched, have 10k trophies and still have 0 legendaries. That's absurd. 
---
Really? That‚Äôs why people are ranked so high!! I just heard about it in December 
---
Well luckily she‚Äôs a moderately low health brawler. She has her good and bad matchups like all brawlers and like you said she‚Äôs good from mid-close so brawlers like colt, dyna, barley, Penny, tara, etc are all pretty good at chipping at her especially if you keep your difference. Also you can bait her super sometimes by swerving in and out of her range 
---
I'd cope that üëå

Anyone wondering exactly what happened to my original channel I will explain it here: 
---
So basically youtube falsely claimed one of my videos as ‚Äúscam‚Äù and it left a strike on my channel. (Someone probably spam reported it)
---
And 9/10 times the ONLY punishment is getting live streams banned for 3 months.
---
But the DAY my channel got monetized (today) was when my monetization got perma banned. 
---
And the algorithm works like this: 
---
Monetization = recommendation
---
Knowing that, and knowing I have no option to receive monetization because support is ignoring me, my only option is to start a new channel and hope to not receive another false strike. 
---
And to anyone who decides to help me get back on my feet, I just want to say thank you. 
---
Im the guy in the bottom right :c

I found it to be the best of the Mortis faces... probably just me being nostalgic, though.

(RIP Epic Mortis though, still wondering why he got moved to Mythic.)

Mortis wins by doing absolutely nothing

Leon and gene?

Are they invisible lol

Wow this is one of the best things I have ever seen 
---
r/cursedimages
---
*taps temple* Can't get last place right after getting first if you never get first
---
THE ARTWORK IS AMAZING.
---
Well he‚Äôs a support, not a damage dealing one man army, of course he isn‚Äôt good at breaking power boxes.
---
Why do you need a rep when r/Mortisgang will destroy you 
---
I wish they didn‚Äôt need frank in boss fight... it‚Äôs unfair to nerf because now he‚Äôs garbage at it.
---
I like the snowflake idea
---
Legendary is a rarity rank, not a power rank. I have no idea where you guys get that idea from.
---
Yea, things got really intense but I‚Äôm glad I won that duel üòé
---
This took time
---
Looked into it... Not sure why but it was Automoderator that went rogue and removed your initial post. This one will stay up.
---
I just had an Idea you need to hear! What if there was a brawler who‚Äôs attack increased in range or damage, depending on how long you hold the aim button?
---
Underage lesbian orgy
---
It's basically Nita piper with a super like Jessie that becomes 5 Mike supers ramping in damage.
---
Six out of twelve
---
Lmao I got him the morning and he‚Äôs / she‚Äôs really good tbh I thought it was like eww what are u and now I‚Äôm like woweoowowowowowowo ok cool
---
Nice but copyright claims .....sad

Oh no you didn‚Äôt

Why the HECK is Poco not with lucio, Darryl should be with reaper

#üòÇ
---
It looks fantastic
---
Cursed_showdown
---
He is a creature of the night
---
Well it‚Äôs kinda the other way round to put it in perspective. 
---
Out of 40 million people only 3 people were able to land the shot of that brawler. In brawl stars it‚Äôs more like there‚Äôs 50 god tier mortis out of 100 million+
---
Let‚Äôs flip it around. As an example let‚Äôs use penny when she came out. She was very balanced at the top of the ladder, yet everyone was complaining she was weak. Supercell decides to buff her by increasing her projectile size, and suddenly she‚Äôs a top tier brawler, and everyone is complaining about her. At the top of the ladder she‚Äôs about the same as before. 
---
Was old penny underpowered because everyone was using her wrong? My answer is no. She isn‚Äôt underpowered, and mortis wasn‚Äôt overpowered but supercell needs to decide who to balance around. Balancing around noobs, penny got a buff, then a nerf to rein her in. That‚Äôs why pam has been mindbogglingly getting buff after buff because noobs don‚Äôt know how to it her shots. However mortis is a special case. His level of strength is such a tiny isolated sphere that it‚Äôs extremely rare to witness that skill yourself, and even then he has hard counters, and can be dealt with even if you don‚Äôt have one of those hard counters on your team. 
---
Also, I want to note that mortis is good in meta‚Äôs where brawlers like rico and dynamike are good and bull/shelley are bad because of his matchups. Supercell recently widened the maps by 4 tiles, and that destroyed throwers and rico especially at the competitive scene. You will never see a dynamike above 600 trophies except in heist (where mortis is obviously not going to be played) and rarely in showdown (which is basically RNG with the matchups) additionally leon slaughters throwers, and tanks generally counter leon. 
---
He‚Äôs saying op could have at least given credit
---
Holy shit dude it‚Äôs a game calm down it‚Äôs not that serious quit crying. Holy /r/IAmVerySmart shit going on here, you‚Äôre not impressing anyone just shhh.
---
You are a brave martyr.  I am very proud of you.  The world is a good place because of people like you
---
yea
---
You dont get skins from boxes.....
---
hello fellow pam
---
This was my idea I had a long time ago in December 
---
Me too
---
Or cactus
---
I know I almost cried of happiness 
---
So it is completely random... basically if you go to the store and hit the white ! with a blue circle around it you can look at your percent chance of getting a any rarity of brawler. The more you open boxes the higher your percent goes up. Once you get that rarity your percent goes down. So just keep opening boxes and hopefully you'll get that legendary brawler your looking for
---
Bad shitpost
---
Now it looks better! Great work!
---
Whats memory leak
---
i‚Äôm sorry you got downvoted lmao reddit is weird. 
---
S E L F I E T I M E
---
Never. They already said teaming is just a strategy, get over it
---
That would be awesome!
---
Well i am unable to give you tips on how to use him when i dont have him. *cries in corner
---
No. Read the rules
---
Ok I'm not gonna be that guy who pints out every single typos
---
You give it as compensation because you have opened many boxes
---
What skin? Also you can‚Äôt get skins from boxes...
---
i sleep
---
Looks sick
---
You dont get a skin.... you get gems as compensation....
---
Ooof Reddit man
---
Time to get constructive 
---
I did not get jewels either
---
I think he got the idea of that since people got compensated for opening boxes when gene came out, probably thinks they were given skins
---
Reaper and Shelly are both hard tank counters. Darryl isn‚Äôt. 
---
I can see every pixel on the mortis
---
Don't.
---
Jkjk you should play support when you're Poco. Poco is clearly geared heavily towards healing teammates, and much more so than doing damage to enemies. His attack power is pretty bad too, so unless you happen to only fight short to medium range brawlers you might be able to solo them easily, given that you keep your distance. In team matches Poco will always be most effective when you back up your teammates and they act as meat shields.
---
Once u pull someone the person will be dragged towards u no matter what is infront of the way
---
thanks for doing it!
---
Yea pls give cool stuff to tara
---
Demolished 50% of health in ten seconds... op much?
---
Ahem*penny*
---
Tara on the other hand 
---
Yeah I see a LOT of people shooting his super off at enemies instead of teammates üòÇ
---
Oh lel
---
Im pretty sure they are only given to people who seeked help from account support at the time that gene was disabled. Cant see why ur complaining much since unless you open hundreds of boxes, you will get as few as 1 gem
---
Yea i know
---
English 100
---
but with the 350 gems you can get mortis
---
I‚Äôm &gt; S T A G &lt; by the way, you can see that I didn‚Äôt receive boss once. Does this happen to everyone or am I just really unlucky?
---
Thank you for reciting the definition that you copied from your most recent Google search. Let me ask; did I say that children are sociopaths? The answer is obviously, no. Also, this leg of the discussion is not about the report system. It is about the behavior of a child that is clearly exhibiting sociopathic behavior, causing stress among those around him for his enjoyment. That does not make him a sociopath‚Äîit merely means that he is exhibiting a sociopathic behavior. 
---
I find it funny how you have almost immediately resorted to ad hominem through a character attack when I have called you out on your pointless remarks. I explained the behavioral reasons for why people force stress on others and then you wanted to prove your abilities when it comes to Googling definitions.
---
If you have to resort to flinging feces at someone in a discussion, you have already lost. Only those who have failed to evolve still use that as their primary tool.
---
Dude, chill. Absolutely nobody would have been able to know all of that from two battle logs. Now that you've clarified that, yeah he's throwing.
---
Although since you're being an asshole, I'm still siding with him. 
---
I think they made sure to only give gems to those who saved boxes. If u opened boxes u earned in that time period, u should not have gotten free gems. Unless they came from the box of course 
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
True, most recolors are usually bland or just don't look too good. These are just skin concepts as well, so if Supercell were to add them in, they could change it how they would like it. \^-\^

---
I wasn't in soft launch countries, so had to use other networks to play it in beta
---
No, what Nita, Jessie, and penny all have in common is that their super spawnable is buffed up to be like the big brawler, problem is that it makes these 3 Brawlers way too op as big brawler.

Well if you don't have any form of proof that you're an OG, it is not likely that you are an OG. Of course, i'm not an OG (been playing since global), so of course I don't have proof, but if you do have proof and are willing to share it, i'd be happy to see it!

---
With Crow in practically any game mode, you'll want to poke at people to charge your super. Never play crow aggressively against brawlers with over 5000 health, just poke them. 
---
I've found that when you have your super he works really well as a scavenger in Showdown. Find two brawlers who are fighting, wait until one of them is dead and provided the other has low health, jump in and finish him off. His poison mechanic is also really annoying, it stops people from healing for a while anyway.
---
When you're breaking boxes, go as close as you can to them as you'll deal around 1000 damage depending on Crow's power level. If you see a tank  coming towards you while you're breaking the box, let them have it, in exchange for a little more super.
---
So yeah, that's what I've gathered from using Crow.  He isn't the best but isn't the worst either. Hope this helps!!
---
Dashingly amazing

No it does not

Carefully, he‚Äôs a hero

How about... EL PRIMOOOO

You paid for that skin 
---
If u tilt trophy‚Äôs change the flair to the tilted brawler really works cuz I untilt 10/100
---
That's a solid idea. If you get hit by one dagger, it's the regular effect, two, and it's toxic poison, with the ticking effect increasing over time for a fixed time. Get hit by all 3, and your attack and speed also slow down. 
---
Thanks!

No they don't. I literally got contacted back from Supercell support and in that email they say that they are working on a reporting method but right now there is nothing they can do and "In the mean time, I advice (sic) you to play with a friend or club-mate to have more successful wins, pick the right comp, or and of course have team mates that will be fair (sic)".

Yh so solo showdown it is then :D tbh I play more for fun and enjoyment so Id rather play good brawl on higher up than hunt on trophies down low.
---
TIL all trolls in gaming are actually sociopaths and need medical attention!!!

Nice clutch shot!

Yeah true, it‚Äôs just a waste of tickets to play big game on this map. Every game you get fucked over by that damn turret and you lose out on so many tokens..
---
Smh don't kill those bots around you. Once 30 Robots will stack up in the map it'll not spawn anymore robots, Leading you to 13:14 mins. You can definitely make a hole with tara and even put your Turret, Bear in the hole. Or just Primo and Dynamike (maxed)

WHY ARE YOU RUNNING

Yes thats true my bad

Sometimes exit button is useless

People spending money in this game, Open tons of boxes and boom, max gene within minutes.

I won against someone who paid harder than me. I‚Äôm still at a deficit right here

So true
---
Agreed
---
Star power is a lot of difference
---
This is so true, I've got 7k trophies and I don't have any mythica and legendaries
---
6.5k 20/23
---
I went from 381 to 317 with El Primo in Brawl Ball w/ randoms a couple of weeks ago. It took me 8 days to recover.
---
THIS is true that they are trying to make....but I think that doing this will not change much... people will still buy the 80,150 gems skins cause they are much cool...30gems skin are just a small change to the outfit of the brawler
---
chad ?
---
Somehow looks like a mix of colt and Bo
---
Why you going into details. 
---
It's been changed about 2 weeks ago. Now the game priorerises your overall trophies. And this is sh*t.
---
I'm stuck at 3200 because 60% players are Bo, 30% are Gene, 9% are Leon and 1% is actual varied good interesting players that are fun to play with.
---
I really wanted to draw bo first but than decided to draw colt lol
---
Be happy you got something extra. 
---
What the fuck 
---
That's why you don't 
---
Now this is epic
---
I'm gonna forgive you since you had the hat

Might be the max chance. You're even closer to one now I guess. 
---

---
Losing streak incoming
---
Yeah i was insipred by that.
---
colt 
---
brok 
---
dynamike 
---
: first time???
---
Gene isn‚Äôt too weak. He‚Äôs in a great spot actually, the power of his super isn‚Äôt even in the damage it‚Äôs in the impact of the enemy displacement. And his ability to poke at range and burst up close with a similar hp to bo is a very strong combo. His abilities almost make gene on of the most versatile brawlers to date. 
---
Wasnt it that meme... ehhh nvm
---
**bruh**
---
hmm that is weird then
---
Try avoiding a Star Power that requires the brawler to die. I know that ruins the special feature of the Phoenix, but Poco‚Äôs first Star Power was that it healed nearby allies when he died, which wasn‚Äôt useful, as survival is a critical part in Brawl Stars gameplay
---
That's crow
---
Would be to OP
---
Or dynamite
---
The artwork of Phoenix is not my creation. It is from a game called [Haypi Monsters](https://haypi-monster.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page). I chose it because it was closest to what I imagined. The above graphic was inspired (aka copied) from u/William_Kraus' Brawler concept. I can never think of such an amazing layout myself.

Please leave your views about Phoenix below. Thanks a lot and I hope you like it!

---
 I love it, especially the water power. We need a new trophy brawler, good job!
---
Good luck trying to find any match when the servers have literally Thanos-snapped the playerbase

Yes, but if he gets a buff he won‚Äôt

Which is the higer ones? Above (Purple highest &amp; Lime lowest) or below (vice versa)?

Go Scrappy I chose you

Idk, but people from CR usually call boxes chests

*Gene has his magic lamp in a lower department*

I‚Äôm at 3.6k trophies, no mythics or Legendaries but bought gene

Well... Yes

Hoe am I supposed to farm ez trophies then?üë∫

Just not cheating....

DUDE! Check your notifications!!

Wow, I completely forgot about Poco's Star Power. You're definitely correct, I should rework the star power.   
---
How about a Star Power that makes Phoenix's attacks temporarily stronger every time it deals damage or uses Super?   
---
Well i'm missing 6 brawlers. I have Spike but not Ricochet. Even though i opened 30 boxes yesterday.

I am sorry, bro. Please, forgive me.

Nice concept man!

Thanks mate üòÑ

they're all camping at the 300 trophy range.

Yeah that's what situation I was in.
---
Doesn‚Äôt apply to firing
---
My man chad be lookin like colt from brawlstar, damn.
---
I was being sarcastic, but I wouldn't call it cheating. 
---
This is so wrong lmao
---
Teaming would still work. And also teams attack each other to charge up their super
---
This isn‚Äôt an actual tier list OP‚Äôs just trying to be funny
---
Who says I can‚Äôt play 100 games per day? 
---
Yh but could help a lil bit 
---
Tbh I really would love a Star Power related to rebirth as you were trying to get at with the original idea. How about some revive mechanic? If not, anything would work
---
oh...oof
---
Level offers don‚Äôt come back
---
Thanks a lot!

I understand your point but is not beneficial for them to optimize those devices because not a lot of people use them .

That's nuts 
---
What do you meeean is not cheatiiingüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ is a SOLO gamemode, if you are in a team,then you are cheating.... For thw moment solo showdown is just a duo showdown with friendly fire

Ok so how about connection errors. I mean normally I‚Äôd say bad luck but to ban people because of it? Besides why not team if you can?

How else can u get Dynamike other than from reaching the certain amount of trophies?

Hahaha is this some kind of a joke? He is too op right now he needs a nerf not buff wtfüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
isn‚Äôt that an oxymoron
---
yea that would be pretty cool
---
Too unfair man like I was playing with randoms who are good but other team straight up dominated us like wtf two level 10s and we straight up got rekt
---
I think I posted my comment wrongly. It was a comment on another comment ops 
---
The situation on the pic is hardly unfair (I have more trophies and less brawlers ahah) 
---
I open 60 boxes and 3 bid boxes!!!!!! Are you stupid?!
---
Or Fool‚Äôs gold 
---
well if it priorities my overall trophis why am i getting matched with people with 850+ trophies while im not even in 750 yet?
---
Hot
---
You can get any brawler opening boxes. 
---
well, i got crow when i was at 800 trophies
---
That's enough internet for today 
---
this will happen @ supercell
---
J√° que pediu com toda essa educa√ß√£o... vai procurar voc√™...
---
Even the trophy road bralwers? Whats the drop rate for them?
---
Before there wasn‚Äôt trophy road, any brawler could have been unlocked from boxes
---
This coming from a Darryl, currently the strongest brawler in the game.
---
But hey "the matchmaking system is fine". 
---
Quit shooting their pets! They just respawn them after you waste your ammo meanwhile they‚Äôve taken zero damage because idiots keeps shooting pets!

I thought Poco was already Mexican

Ohhhhh, now I get it!

I counted auto-aim as a single one (composed) lol English is not my native language, I‚Äôm sorry for the mistake (though I knew from the beginning I could get this comment, I just decided to roll the dice anyway)

That feeling.........................when you get leon &amp; gene from the same free box

Looks like everybody's dead teammates came back one at a time while simultaneously attacking each other in the center of the map. Your teammate came out last and just out survived the disaster

I agree that the post wasn't that funny, but it's your attitude that made ppl downvote you.
---
This is just stupid teaming, and a scummy way to say it doesn't take it away. This isn't blending in teaming masses. Teaming is teaming. I haven't seen a single teaming mortis that wasn't spinning. 8k+ player here.
---
I have every brawler except  for bo because I bought them.

You did. Congratulations.

You murderer you have merged barley with mortis!! Thats not acceptable!

when they get lined up and you get your Super again and again, it's so satisfying.
---
Somehow Brock is surprisingly effective in brawl ball so nope you're wrong there
---
I'm still hooked since global release. Play for a couple hours a day and up to 5k trophies. Not found a mobile game I enjoy this much in ages.
---
That is *literally* your subjective opinion, no matter how strongly you feel about the matter.  Others may disagree with your opinion and feel that dev team‚Äôs focus could be better spent on other aspects of the game. 
---
That is how opinions work. 
---
Let‚Äôs play 
---
Really nice concept! Personally I feel like the backwards firing shots should deal slightly less damage than the front facing. 
---
Take gem grab for example, when trying to seize an enemy Phoenix team from the center, if you have someone trying to flank the enemy team while the rest of you push from the opposite area, he'll offer an insane amount of utility, and punish your team severely if he's trying to focus an individual player, but able to attack and possibly prevent the rest of you from pushing up.
---
Hopefully that makes sense haha, but that's just my opinion ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
Brawl Stars The Musical?
---
Good for You!

Ferda

No but it is true that vast majority of player rn is sub3k

Leon is definitely better, but depends on your gems cuz he is like 500

How come you don't play as much as you did? Just got a little bit samey after so long?

You don't

I understand that supercell needs to make money off the game and doesn't want to give out too much for free. I would be perfectly satisfied with exclusive skins for being above a certain trophy count. Just don't give me these pathetic rewards for weeks of hard pushing...

He didn‚Äôt add the name, u/phlorpe added it because he knew people would still it
---
Yeah, It just gets boring because they used to have updates every 2-3 months with 1-2 brawlers. I played for a week then stopped after most updates
---
Go to brawlers in the left side menu of buttons and scroll down as he is a mythic 
---
brawl stars really is not friend-friendly game
---
it is hard to play with your friend who play after you a lot
---
We need more trophy road brawlers. People like me aren't lucky enough to get them out of brawl boxes.
---
Ahh thats a shame. I find when brawl ball isn't available I don't play as often as when it is, but it would be nice to see a new game mode or something similar.
---
Can you send the video? I want to watch it
---
Im ‚ÄúImNotEdd‚Äù as you can see and im the barley on the screen. The name of the Bull is from an admin of the page and ‚Äúbrawlstarszone‚Äù is just the page‚Äôs name. Im an admin too. Is it clear now?
---
Thanks

A new game mode will get me playing again if it isn‚Äôt a special one. The last new game mode was brawl ball like 6-9 months ago I think

Knowing supercell, they'll have some updates in the pipeline already for this. Just a question of when they release them I guess.

Yeah definitely

Yes, it's rat kills, because he was killing rats!

Nice thanks though. I'll check if it's available for android

And this is why someone should do this

Lmao I saw that

Yeah... it's available on android
---
How often does it show up?
---
r/crowgang set a message to you in a form of a legendary 
---
It's not Sc's fault it's just your bad connection
---
I wish we could get more more skins that are thematically accurate instead of the holiday skins we usually get.
---
Really? My Nita is lvl 8 almost lvl 9 and I‚Äôve got a bunch of lvl 7s
---
This is why I grind using solo showdown, I have no friends who have the game :/
---
I got Spike at 1k trophies with a regular brawl box and then I got Leon at 1400 three brawl boxes after getting Darryl. I‚Äôm so bad at this game but way too lucky ;-;
---
Yeah lol
---
You can always ask r/crowgang 
---
What,power level 1 compared to enemies with 6 or five,yeah,doesent matter, capitan oblivious,and secondly,new matchmaking  system works by your total trophies,now i have 2600 trophies,he has it too,but i have 200 trophies on tara,he has only 90 and 1 power level,im complaining that new matchmaking system works like sht,got it???

Yup, that's me

i know that 1% is over 5k but i don‚Äôt know how many people are over 9-11k but i am one of them and when i and the other og‚Äôs started it was no trophy road or something like that

This is not putting crow down. This is a cry for a buff fellow crow fans.

The hero we need and deserved for the hero we needED but didnt deserve. This thread was too funny cant wait for the next challenger

Find a gd teammate.

Yup that's why I included a cooldown where you MUST be a hunter before you can play as big brawler again

It's random for everyone but on average id say every 3weeks?

---
Yeah nice but I'm not really positive if thats a good addition tho
---
But yeah maybe nerf big brawler and make it 4v1 so u have more chances of being big brawler 
---
And ofc nerf minions and turrets
---
it‚Äôs to break ur kneecaps with
---
It is awful. No need to explain
---
.. right there?
---
Shut up
---
Yeah my brother at 1500ish has Frank, Tara, and Gene. It makes me sad because I've spent money on the game too. 
---
Cursed account luck I guess haha 
---
So? They aren‚Äôt on trophy road
---
A way to pick who you want to be will also help with the fact that it's hard to chose a brawler because you don't know if you will be a boss or a hunter. Different brawlers are better/more fun in different roles
---
And here we see a pack of Morti hunt down the flock of throwers... Nature is fucking lit fam
---
Wow that‚Äôs good is thier a brawler in thier?
---
True
---
Well I‚Äôve gotten mortis to 750 without playing brawl ball, if you need a showcase or an AMA I‚Äôve got both floating around reddit. 
---
Sryv
---
i dont want to be rude but it burns my eyes.
---
thanks
---
I just found out , r/Bogang has teamed up with the enemies!! 
---
Go away BOgang ! you will never get a buff! 
---
Wait who was the last one 0_0
---
You definitely pulled him before trophy road 
---
Mine never did after 3 monthd
---
This.
---
exactly, would make showdown so much better
---
Yeah that sucks lol. I have 2 friends that started playing like 3 weeks after me and they're both at 1500. One already pulled Piper and the other pulled Tara. It's insane
---
So accurate xd
---
I got crow at about 4k no mythic or epic 
---
you are incorrect. Crow is bad
---
Neither, she‚Äôs a pirate 
---
Why did it take you 200 tr ?

Oh yes !

No, join the r/shellygang

If I am not mistaken some Brawl Ball and Heist maps have water as well ü§î

It would be really useful for people with higher trophies but if you were at lower trophies you would get a match practically instantly so you wouldn‚Äôt have time to open a box

I got Leon at 2699

aW dAwG iM jUsT bO mAn, iM nOt rEaLlY bRoCk
---
I just got a new iPhone XS and was able to transfer my data fine onto my new phone, but now every time I play any game mode, and at random times my shoot button will just disappear. I have no way to recreate it as it happens randomly but I was able to get a screenshot (although I‚Äôm not sure how to add it to a comment). Also whenever it comes back, it auto fires a few shots, which I am assuming is from me spamming the button while it was gone. Anyways this bug is basically making the game unplayable for me, and I have looked everywhere online and no one seems to have had this problem before me, so hopefully you guys know how to fix.
---
Looks more like Korra to me. 
---
El Primo after life
---
nah you just need a member of the mortis gang
---
Yeah thanks bro. Barleys my fav‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Did you mean 5 seconds?
---
Leon is john cena. You can't see him.
---
Really clever dude
---
Tell him that you're doing solo showdowns
---
I just bought Gene with gems since he's on sale.
---
Maybe it's just me, but I hate gene. He sucks. I want my gems back. Lol
---
I got Le√≥n at 1k
---
I think it may be an issue with the auto navigation, where the game will automatically attempt to move you around walls and through holes when trying to pass near/through them
---
The way you made this post makes me want to die 
---
Wow, weird but good to know
---
Cool! Good concept! 
---
Give him Crow's beak lmfao
---
That guy low key looks like mortis 
---
Kid looks like he cant talk... I‚Äôm not happy because if he looks forward to playing video games he won‚Äôt be a functioning member of society 
---
Than a Tara supers the barley and kills him
---
It might be lag you‚Äôre describing 
---
Mortis should have a samurai hat 
---
Not OP lol but he is legit as you level him up 
---
I need an artist for a brawler concept cause I'm terrible at drawing...A tortoise/turtle/hedgehog or anything like that! The brawler will  be medium HP so it shouldn't have a lot of armour...
---
That would add some great meta to brawl ball, I‚Äôm all for it
---
It‚Äôs a mobile game but I see what you mean
---
barley had to do it to em
---
wait, that's illegal
---
Rico needs to be more thicc
---
Perfect! Thanks 
---
just happy to know that I'm not the only one who noticed how lame the rewards are.
---
r/uselessredcircle 
---
This should be ilegal
---
Totally agree
---
Am I the only one who sees an edited google screenshot?
---
Why are you so offended by someone calling out sociopathic behavior? Have you thrown your fair share of Brawl Ball games? If so, then the reason you likely did so was because you knew you would tick off your teammates. Just because those players are not witnessing the stress caused, does not mean that they aren‚Äôt gaining satisfaction from the thought of it happening. 
---
And yes, you recited a definition, which tells you what a full-on sociopath is, but not each trait displayed by the type, which is why I called you out on it.
---
Pick your fight next time; you just fought a losing battle by challenging me on a definitional basis when we were discussing the the actual qualities of a sociopath. Just like any quality, it can be displayed by non-sociopaths, which is why I called him a child, but that behavior is prevalent in sociopaths.
---
I tried to benefit all brawlers equally (Sharpshooters perform well on the sides of the map, characters like Shelly and Bull can hide in the bushes in te center,...). Also it is different from the other maps that are currently available for Bounty, so it would be a good way of adding more variety.
---
Buff Crow
---
Nah. I beat the big brawler in 1 minute or so and got more than 30 tokens.
---
I honestly just lost a showdown to a respawned player with 0 cups when I had 14.. He used his ult on me and my player just stopped moving. I couldnt move out of it. It‚Äôs fucking rediculous.
---
That looks sick
---
I dont think i understand, why are they so dark.
---
No u
---
But why Pewdiepie? Cause he has a lot of subs?
---
You should‚Äôve pressured that dynamike 
---
no
---
Best comment ever.
---
Welcome to my tape.
---
That's really uncool! üëÄ

This what? Darryl winning a showdown? 
---
¬°Hola! Debe decirte que este subreddit no habla espa√±ol sino que hablamos √∫nicamente en ingl√©s ;). Estoy franc√©s pero debo hablar en ingl√©s tambi√©n... Con tu problema de jugadores no atacando a otros, es un problema recurrente que llamamos ‚Äúteaming‚Äù; no puedes hacer nada y supercell no puede tampoco. Lo siento!
---
They look similar but the gameplay is soooo different
---
He can talk but he is rather shy and Video games are things that make us happy talking with people where they cant judge us of what we are or not
---
Take this silver! Well deserved! üòç
---
Please don't. 
---
omgg xDDD!
---
I doubt they will help
---
What have you done???!??!?!!
---
yes he will make brawlstars get even more popular!
---
I could if you joined r/BoGang tho üëÄ
---
My connection is fine.
---
If it would be lag, it‚Äôs certainly not coming from me.
---
Yes they should do that. 
---
Hell yeah üëÄ
---
Thanks üòÑI am around 5600 . Hope they will add at least new type of trophy road reward to the game üòÑ
---
But why him? Does he play Supercell games? I used to like Pewdiepie when he used to play horror games.
---
I got gene too lol, want proof?. I am worried that you honestly took the time to get on reddit to tell me, do you have friends you could tell or family you haven‚Äôt alienated and made hate you? 
---
You definitely put the hole of the turret there on purpose 
---
wholesome asf
---
LOL, Thanks.
---
Lol is supercell really that dumb ? They should've fix this already  
---
Welp i wouldn't mind more free tokens
---
Great idea!
---
But where did you get the template for the brawler creation? Or did you make it?
---
269 gems = 50 box (+19 gems)
---
1 mythic drop = 1 chance on ~400 box
---
So basically it's 4x time better to unlock him with gems BUT you could be lucky and drop him under 50 box and then that would be a huge waste (because no gold and pp at all).
---
The blindness won‚Äôt do anything quickfire will counter it
---
Thank you
---
Of course it‚Äôs a poco....
---
Your idea is just like your skin
---
Lol the mortis wasn't teaming he was trying to kill me without getting hurt btw I was the dynamike I remember this match from last night 
---
her basic passing through walls? I think that‚Äôs way too much advantage 
---
piper is perfectly fine, i got her to 500 with randoms at lvl 6 with no problem 
---
me last night :&gt;
---
So they remove decent memes but don't remove the actual low effort posts...sad.
---
RIP
---
How is removing gene without a notification a cash grab?
---
#You forgot the pants.

Just imagne Piper as A gem carrier on this map, once she got ten she can even super out, but fhurther its a great map

Same here, playing on iOS, with LTE. Wonder if switching to 3G would solve the problem? WiFi is kinda laggy too.

Looks like exe.
---
I like exe.
---
I like this
---
That‚Äôs not my experience at all. You end up a Power cube (sometimes 2!) up, you got a fast kill and you got an ult out of it. I backstab *all* the time, I‚Äôm 11.5K with 1300 showdown wins. 
---
Actually backstabbing is probably better than teaming. 
---
Friendly games exist...
---
Alladin :D
---
Lmao i suck so idk how to create a sub kill me.-.
---
How did you get so many token doublers?
---
Man i went from getting like a 100 trophy to 10-15 a day...(im at 1.9k atm, very little ik ;-;)

I like ur idea, but u wouldn't get any reward right?
---
Crow: 1176 if u hit three daggers + poison= 1568. 1568x2 = 3126. 3126 =\= 5040.
---
Thats my point lol
---
I said "if matchmaking if based on level, whats the point of leveling up a brawler?"
---
That isn't my review
---
