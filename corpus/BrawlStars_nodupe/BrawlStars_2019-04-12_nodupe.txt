Obviously pam and jessie are getting a nerf. Crow will probably not get anything because popular to popular misconception hes not weak.

‚ÄúInsanely talented artist‚Äù yeah those this-took-me-69-years artists are really talented XD but really I think supercell like gifted the gems they were supposed to get in secret or smth and every 2 weeks or smth put up the winning covers on the facebook page
---
I have all brawlers except the legendaries and I didn‚Äôt pay any money for brawl boxes or buy any brawlers from shop
---
why??? all this for some upvotes...

I can‚Äôt fully express with words how true this is and how much frustration it has caused me
---
Ok
---
So true
---
Shelly on bounty
---
Then you got lucky. That has nothing do with skill and everything to do with chance.
---
Chill bro it‚Äôs just 2 trophies... At least better than me losing 50 trophies yesterday because of siege
---
I hate telling them no so I do
---
It would be cool if the loading screen depended on which brawler you were playing as, and you get to choose which screen for that brawler
---
I miss that tutorial and everything that there was
---
Lol that would be rlly sad, is this real?
---
White crow should be 30 gems. Unless its getting a remodel
---
F
---
That isn't that good. I think you should try to save up for when a legendary or a mythic comes along.
---
And Snake
---
Don't you mean right wing? üòÇ
---
Its the angle
---
I dont experience lag. Improve your connection
---
Ok so him getting crow is not impressive at all and is chance therefore 7k is unimpressive
---
Oh my gosh! that looks so fancy, and well drawn! that monocle kinda fits Rico too! I like the gun idea.
---
It's really creative!
---
Play long range brawlers and dont stop moving for anything.
---
Who said anything about him getting crow? And no 7k on a f2p account is impressive that‚Äôs why youtubers do videos where they don‚Äôt pay.
---
I was thinking that they could add 25 or 30 every once in a while
---
This image hurts in so many levels... (Even if it is photoshopped, a glitch or something)
---
Not enough mortis
---
So true lmfao. Like I would be running around trying to find people and as soon as I find one I lose it.
---
Don‚Äôt get it, can someone explain?
---
The heist maps are so bad too
---
Are you serious. Are you actually serious. Just because they put out an animation DOES NOT mean that they aren‚Äôt working on what the community wants. You know the marketing team and the dev team are separate right? Fortnite is like twenty times bigger than brawl stars and they can afford more devs. If you are actually so entitled that you think everything will come your way and you‚Äôre unable to wait 2 months for an update then the brawl stars community is better off without you.
---
That hurts the brawl star soul
---
Yes from super paper mario
---
A good Piper is almost impossible to kill alone as Carl. You'll need to work with your team. Both piper and Brock out range Carl and have faster projectile speeds. 
---
Piper is a soft counter to Carl on open maps... Piper is at her strongest when enemies are far away, while Carl is strongest when enemies are close (if he has super). However, the moment you get close enough to piper for your super, she will just super away
---
Best i can do is 23.999999999999
---
Normally I'd attempt to roast someone for a video like this.... But you straight ignored everyone and didn't actually team.... So I'm gonna give you an upvote
---
How is this even possible? You can't lose any Trophies at all if you're below 30, the game flat-out won't let you.

Yea the game gets bland after a while, with something new it adds a little more spice to the game, less dull

Actually trickshot was the original name of colt
---
Why is everybody on the brawl stars reddit unable to wait two months for an update? It‚Äôs not like you haven‚Äôt done it before
---
very violent backstab too
---
And I assume it's the opposite for tanks. How long did it take to get his star power? I migjt not be in the same situagionbsince my highest level brawler is 7 as a global f2p
---
This is so true. My homie always want to play as Poco and I try and tell him he's not good at showdown and heist and he's like "I need to level him up" and I get leveled down.
---
thanks bro

Piper is really good in snake

Why does it have 700k views in 2 weeks
---
They should make it possible to get a star power from a box once a brawler is level 7. The star powers are game changers and sometimes change how you have to use a brawler.
---
SO. TRUE AT THE END LOLOLOL

For the sake of humanity, I suggest this video never sees the sunshine of day.

Ran away? Those dudes were chasing him all around the map!

I dislike it with a passion, but maybe that's because I haven't figured out how to play it.

Ang tips for leveling up brawlers? Sorry if this is getting tedious. But I "barley" reached 4k this morning and almost lost it to randoms

You forgot map/skin concepts that will never make it to the game
---
Gene &amp; Gene Dream Team
---
Teamers are friendly people... usually.
---
I think normal attack is absurdly ranged, because:
---
- it has great damage close range.
---
- stops healing even with 1 shuriken at limit (which deals ~125 damage).
---
- low spread and throws shurikens one-by-one instead of all at the same time (so he can aim from far away to deal ~500 damage at 9.5 range, more or less the same damage as a Shelly pellet).
---
- his range is the 2nd longest basic attack range in the game, tied with Rico, only being outranged by Brock and Piper.
---
Besides the stupidly great basic attack aspects, he has decent health, great speed, unique super (the main reason he's a legendary) and a SP that helps him being what he is, a Stealthy Assassin. But these ones are what make Leon what he should be, and it would feel awkward if one of these aspects were removed from Leon. Right now, the only thing from Leon that doesn't fit him is his sniper attack range.
---
Cool Man
---
Do i have bad luck or something, i have one brawler at lvl 8 and a few at lvl 7 thats it and am also around 3k
---
Tell me what ya think
---
I never auto-aim with her, she is hard because a lot of people get better at dodging higher up, she can land hits if they are getting pushed by someone else but it is hard for her to create her own opportunities, and if multiple people start pinching you she is powerless because of her slow reload speed which makes it hard for her to deal with multiple opponents at the same time, granted a pinch is usually going to end in your doom anyways, but some brawlers can get out of that which Piper can‚Äôt do since her jump is slow and rarely brings her to safety.
---
She is best in team oriented modes where she doesn‚Äôt need to play aggresively, and right now bounty and gem grab are the only good options that offer that, and gem grab has a lot of walls on most maps.
---
Big Bang is completely broken.
---

---
Colt was a male named gunslingee, trickshot appears right next to him.
---
Technically impossible, the game was coded in a way where you can not get 2 brawlers in back to back small box‚Äôs values worth, max you could get from a big box would be 2

Oh yeah yeah

Shut up.

correct

Almost everyone knows the sd exploit and the lowest possible tilt, you must be fun at parties.

Rule 4. Keep your post titles descriptive and provide context. Additionally do not use low effort/all caps/clickbait titles.

Yes
---
Good idea, but the more the game becomes about good comps, the less it becomes about power level, and that would make spending money less useful, so SuperCell isn't going to do it.

nah man i don't like eyes i don't think this is good idea

and that means...?
---
I wish there's an option to block up to 3 brawlers that you don't want to match up on your team. This would prevent idiots from choosing brawlers that are not good on certain maps. For example, some people choose el primo on bounty maps.
---
Thanks for the info but please don't try to remove other's post recklessly
---
They are only kids if i want them that way ,bu hahahahaha
---
No he didnt lie

1) I knew the sd exploit but not the trophy to 0 thing, I knew the lowest possible tilt was &gt;0 but wasn‚Äôt sure what it was.

2) *Joke‚Äôs on you*, I‚Äôve never been to a party */s*

I had pretty much the same situation, still got a way to somehow lose -50 in the end

Wouldn't work because the matchmaking relies on trophy count and to switch brawlers would make it messed up

That is epic: Frank without pants :-)

Saving boxes really doesn't help speed up the progression of getting new Brawlers; you can just open 1 box and pull Leon (which is what happened to some of my friends). You only ever save up boxes for the new upcoming Brawler. And, u/IchBinFan. I'm at 7.1K trophies with no Legendaries so don't complain.

Nice! It's a shame that Piper is only good in Bounty and a few Showdown maps. She plays similar to Brock I think.

Bonjour Supercell je suis NightWolf j'esspere que mon message sera lu. Je joue beaucoup a brawl stars et j'adore mais aussi a clash of clans et clash royale. Je voulais savoir si vous acceptez un autre mode de jeu. Comme par example un survivant ou il y a 2 equipes de 5 brawleurs et se battent entre elles. Et pour que ce soit plus longue chaque brawlers airont 3 vie. A bout de 3 vies elemin√© le personnage sera elemin√©. La victoire est de eleminer tout les 5 brawlers de la team adverce. √áa pourait etre un evenement a ticket pour etre plus rare. J'aurais bien aime que c une personne qui me repend. Et j serais trec content si √ßa se realiserait. √áa fait 1 mois que j pence a ce mode de jeu. Merci d avoit tout lu et passez une bonne journ√©e ( j'ai fait trop de fautes car je ne suis par Fran√ßais¬† desol√©)

All of that art stolen.

When you're over 3k you're only matched with people 3k and above (unless they queue with friends). So before we had 400 El Primos with 500 trophies. Now we have 400 El Primos that just have more brawlers and at 3k. Really, there isn't actually an impactful difference.

also Colts, they never team from my experience

What?

They changed it because they don't want the game to be wild west themed

Well aware of that. This is a quick paced mobile shooter. When I play with random I just don't care who they play as and generally it makes no difference. It's a good idea but it would only slow then game down. No way in hell SC would do this

it doesnt matter if your at 9k or 10k the trophies of your brawler matter, u can have a 300 shelly and an account with 9k but your temmate has a 300colt but an account with 1500 trophies
---
You do know tesming has been a thing for more then a year and we've come by every possible solutions. This isnt gonna end teaming since people who wanna team will still team between them!

I agree with you right know he is balanced i pushed him to 500 really easely

Every showdown map has teaming. But this one has just too much. Have you ever experienced getting cornered by teamers on this map. If not, you either are a teamer or or you just haven't played this map with a brawler over 400 trophies. All the teaming on this map is caused by being scared of going to the center and get killed by a short range brawler. To enter the middle there are only 2 or 3 paths from each side. When you try to get in the middle, if someone spots you they will try to kill you. You will most likely get killed by teamers when trying to enter the middle too late. That's the main problem with this map.

If you think about it, Pinball Dreams is very much like the old maps before the "spawn in goal" update, because before that update maps like Backyard ball, Pinhole Punt and Sneaky fields had the thing that hides the goal two tiles away from it and after the update it changed to three tiles, which removes the ability to just super the ball from fer away into the goal boxes and trickshot it in. Pinball dreams right noq is the only map with the boxes two tiles from the goal.

He is top 3 brawler on most gem grab maps right now as long as you land your pulls. He is also pretty good in duo showdown and bounty. Not bad on bball as well.
---
As well I noticed I didn't get any new brawlers until I pushed most of mine to / over 300 trophies which started to be difficult as had them just lvl 7 or less and suddenly new brawler ! Maybe this is just because of increasing luck from opening boxes ?

Ni way you have to get money in any box (except brawlbox if its give you brawler it will be the only thing you get)
---
I don‚Äôt understand what problem you are having, it‚Äôs no different then any other brawler, just surprise him or use range to your advantage and when you see him place mines don‚Äôt go near them or explode them and back away
---
That skin should not be 80 gems when golden barley is 30 and panda Nita as well. I don't understand why that recolor is so much more

Mortis exploit was op

now post a leon meme

WHAT?!
---
I feel there's another comp, just pretty much a "standard" comp. Colt, Bull, Dyna, Barley, Brock, etc. Any combination of the 3, and you've got the "standard" comp, where it's good both on defense and offense, but not particularly OP at either. Works the best overall since it's very balanced.
---
Ooooooooo, I like it
---
Reminds me of the match where I got matched up with a bull and el primo, while I was playing as el primo, while we were on n open-ish map. Needless to say we got our asses handed to us by colts. Honestly Im down for this.

I'm trying to get better at solo. Mostly trying to avoid cornering myself... Solo just seems boring though. I feels like it takes forever and getting 9th or 10th place is horrible.
---
Haha I was thinking that too, but it would be weird to have a section just for Life Leech, I think the trophy road is the best way to fix Life Leech from "being confusing", around 1k trophies you already discovered how to read event information and stuff, so you cannot blame the game for it's "poor" design
---
That's the problem
---
There are a lot of possibilities
---
Only 40k to go
---
Downvote all you want. I have an abundance of karma.
---
Wait is that Minecraft? I see you‚Äôre a man of culture as well.
---
I guess I thought the way you suggested it would be more like a dedicated life leech section?
---
I mean I think the 4 events have to be the same for everyone.
---
So I guess what I'm suggesting is that life leech would only appear (randomly, not always) as a modifier in the 4th slot. So sometimes the 4th event would be showdown, and it could have a chance of having life leech.
---
So new players won't ever see it, but all of the events are always the same for everyone.
---
Its not reacting at all. I need to let go of the screen and then its working perfectly fine smh ..
---
You're definitely retarded for being proud of worthless internet points.
---
You said the "special events slot", I tought you meant the Ticket Events one. And btw, the Showdown slot is the second slot, not the 4th. But yeah, I would like life leech to be with the other event modifiers but only for the players who unlocked it
---
That would be one of the best updates.
---
Yeah, I really miss Life Leech
---
probably one of my favorite skin ideas right here

This doesn't mean it's not coming at all. Frank tweeted that an artist had been done with his work and was now chilling with the Nita Bear, and the guy said the things he said in this picture. This doesn't mean anything, as Frank could've meant that the artist in the picture didn't work on any of these things and that the fact that he is done doesn't mean that the Bo remodel is, since a different artist might be working on it. 
---
This might sound complicated, but I hope you understand.

I pointed out that his post was not related to the sub in any way and his ego got hurt and and he started hurling abuses at me.
---
350? Wow. Do you have all brawlers ? The new one hasn't been announced yet so it can take a while. How long have you been saving it for ? Since Carl release ? 
---
I can feel your pain with the coins. I had the same when I was waiting for Carl.
---
Yes if you got the right brawler. The option is limited.
---
Super rare rate drop is 1/80 
---
i still didn't see difference in my chances
---
Not gonna lie, this is dope. BUT.... my question is, if they did add this would it be some sort of copyright infringement on a Disney character?
---
It would make more sense with gene, because the hook could pull enemies üòÉ

Because yes

I think it was 89 when it first came out

Brawl-Bad

I love your art!

In a post where he suggests that Barley should insta-kill Dyna? And in a reply chain in which he literally spells out "j o k e"? And in a comment where he LITERALLY SUGGESTS THAT HIS OWN SUPER SHOULD STUN HIMSELF? You gotta lay off that brawl juice if you know what I mean.
---
Works for me.
---
So obviously that would be great but you can‚Äôt realistically expect a huge playerbase like Brawlstars to all stop teaming as an integrity move, and yes the community dig themselves into this hole, but if your providing a service like entertainment it‚Äôs the entertainer job to satisfy and help the customer‚Äôs needs, so it‚Äôs supercells responsibility to fix teaming. Also in case your wandering I don‚Äôt team even to betray
---
I get it now
---

---
I just assumed it was exhaust fumes from the cart like a car.
---
Gedi kor deserves them though.
---
I don‚Äôt know what you mean, I am 15 years old and I live in the Netherlands, my English isn‚Äôt the best, so I don‚Äôt understand those ‚Äòjokes‚Äô of yours.
---
It‚Äôs both
---
I counted thr trophies, your team had over 30 more. So you were more op. Actually, quite even. Just dont start complaining
---
Dude... not cool
---
Thanks for your art post! If you are not the creator of this work, please make sure that you have included the source, or to  comment it here! Unsourced art may be removed if you are not the creator.

I thought he thinks that it was a joke I pushed Mike in heist, I thought that he thinks that I team in Showdown, now I see it, I am so stupid, I am sorry :(.
---
I was subed with my main acc and then i saw this and went to sub them with my other 5 accounts
---
Wtf
---
No, as long as you understand what the sentence means (which I'm assuming you do), you understand the joke. Or least you should.
---
Don't forget to check out my other concepts, because I have 9 now. Especially my last post, Ashen, because I am very proud of her! Feedback is always appreciated!
---
Correct
---
Oof the fact that you posted this right after I lost 30 trophies using night which mortis skin
---
I misunderstood, I thought he was refering to me, playing Mike in heist instead of teaming in Showdown.
---
Doesn't make the idea good lol get your head outta your ass
---
Can i view your club first?
---
Matchmaking is based on trophy count, not power
---
He couldn't have taken him on with all his backup. Plus he had super.
---
1. What
---
2. Many people already posted this idea
---
tanks? it was all long range brawlers
---
BEAAAAAHHHHHHR
---
Cool
---
Its just coincidence... or is it?
---
*sudden Vsauce triggers*
---
Please read my last Comment, I feel so stupid ‚Üì
---
Thanks for giving credit ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
but crow is on spike's team and shelly is on colt's team
---
That‚Äôs more of an aggrocontrol comp than full aggro, mike serves as a thrower/support brawler
---
Why is it scarier than Annabelle?
---
he could've at least ran away because the poco was the only guy below him
---
Anytime brotha
---
I am so sorry :(
---
Dude you have less than 100 trophies with your brawler, what you espect power 10 teamates? Stop complaining for stupid things kid
---
Supercell baiting us harder than me losing trophies with randoms üò´üò´
---
What channel? I looked up brawl stars and it wasn‚Äôt there
---
Run away all you want. That poison's gonna close in and he's gonna get demolished.
---
Ik, but I think matchmaking should also be based on power level. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair when  the enemy team has level 5 brawls, and our team has one level one brawler who just dies instantly.
---
Same
---
Half of his drawings dont fit any theme this game has at all
---
frank is 700
---
It is suposed to but i still face 700 trophs pros as my 470 team...
---
So you want this sub to turn into an artwork showcase sub?
---
Carls star power should be if he kills a brawler he becomes a weaker version of them for like 5 seconds
---
No tanks no teaming
---
I‚Äôm at 7.5k with no legendaries, Tara, or Penny..... lmao
---
What level is she
---
Better than the Valentine's day one
---
yes
---
Have you seen the clash Royale sub? They‚Äôre all toxic and insanely greedy. Then they just bitch about everything. I was subbed for like 2 years
---
I think Tara would be hundreds of years old assuming she is a fortune teller/witch
---
No read the description
---
Yes! I want to play the game but no point where there are no star tokens and keys, and I have all my brawlers 500
---
I genuinely enjoyed this, So great! By the way, hows the 3d modeling coming along?
---
Nita, Jessie and Leon are younger, they're so smol and their voices sounds like a kids's voice

didn't I message u GEDI-KOR to make a bull skin? ü§î
---
Some one already posted this before this has been posted like a good 3 to 4 times
---
That's ironic because we havent seen life leech since like an update ago
---
He looks eyeless
---
Well that's wrong because I have crow and I know how to use him. He's a beast if you're going up against spawners
---
shut up

Boxing with glasses seems like an incredibly bad idea lol

The only thing I think they could do is add in banning people when given evidence.

it‚Äôs not like that‚Äôs uncommon lol. 2.3k is pretty easy to get

leave that bully alone
---
They both hold their guns the same way as well
---
D I S T A N C E
---
What trophy count are you?
---
But he has 1000
---
Or like a video to explain
---
but how do carl's clothes fit Frank? Hmmmmm...either Frank is actually smaller, Carl is bigger, or both.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I think both.
---
Valanced, omg. Learn to write
---
Are you sure your teammates are also playing aggro when you do that?
---
Maybe he can bribe supercell for a *pam nerf*

Were his peg leg

How does one do that? Like, what mod or whatever was downloaded?
---
You wanna link?

We can see the footprints in front of you, I‚Äôm not as retarded as everyone else here obviously...

Yes please

how many times have you won a 1 vs 1 vs 8?

not being the 8
---
its true

He abierto 80 cajas y 10 cajas grandes y no me toca un nuevo brawles

But we still need it...
---
The meme format is supposed to be interpreted as "nobody asked for a situation/thing, but it's provided by x as shown in picture."
---
you dissing my man Gedi-Kor??? how dare you
---
#NerfPam
---
yes, that one was the BEST
---
at least give us kaboom cannon again supercell
---
*knock* *knock* *knock* FBI OPEN UP
---
But just because they are both thrpwers doesnt make them not unique. Barley has a unique super, his shots stick around for a while and his attacks heal him. Dynamike can jump with his attacks, has a different super, and his attacks go off sooner or later depending on where they are thrown. Even if they were the same level of uniqueness, they are different rarities so by your logic barley should be more unique than dynamike.

Is this private server

Will good luck

No idea, but I would say it doesn't hurt to try to contact customer support and see.

Worst case scenario, you are stuck with the skin, which you already are. Might as well try.
