Carl and Rosa SUPER needs to be a longer duration
---
---
---
I DIDNT SEE THE VIDEO!!! HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO KNOW??!!!
---
Yes
---
thank you kind sir
---
deal with it
---
How the heck Rico is nervous sweating
---
Yes, agreed. I opened a bunch of boxes last time I was saving them :(
---
its true. bentimm showed a video
---
Literally everyone is talking about El Primo and not the IKE
---
Ninja is the best
---
Yeah scott!
---
Yes same thing for me
---
Her super unleashes a giant bouncing ball, it can hit same enemies several times and has a rolling range of Darryl‚Äôs old super
---
But supercell just wants everyone to p2w...
---
you're not looking to good urself there
---
What‚Äôs your trophy count wth him
---
holy fuck man I never saw her with her super jesus
---
Sounds kind like how op Rosa was at release...
---
Boss bot is a bad skin I don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs gedi kor
---
This is just teaming. Don't do it.
---
The Retropolis update will probably be available tomorrow or sometime later this week but we won't know **for sure** when Bibi is released until she is visible in-game and we can see the release timer.
---
id say +300
---
Hey! Rosa sees crow as my profile picture! Lol
---
Nice
---
so we should nerf leon again because you dominate with him also??
---
depends if you have a brawler in mind you want to upgrade and have the gold to upgrade said brawler
---
Shelly is actually super adorable
---
üÖ±Ô∏è
---
what happens after? do you guys backstab?
---
His super will be him spinning while spewing fire/smoke from out of his car's muffler
---
I‚Äôm honored you found my post and account good enough to copy, but *why* exactly?
---
The effort you put behind each one is awesome
---
thanks bro
---
Yes it's been happening for a week or two
---
i guess he throws a jack
---
But Piper?.. üò≠
---
My friend is the original rawr I just made this account cause I was bored and wanted to see what happened if I just stole there post I‚Äôm deleting this account now
---
Dkin
---
Old darryl + Frank = Bibi, sounds better
---
Is*
---
yeah or be more careful on what slot you invite him on
---
69th upvote! I laughed out loud üòÇ
---
At the range I play (500-750 trophies) it‚Äôs usually very easy to avoid a shot especially in that way. The biggest issue is that if a piper jumps I will shoot their landing zone if it‚Äôs within line of sight, this is especially easy on brock because he has significant travel time on his rockets, and even if it‚Äôs out of LOS he can use his own ult.
---
Outift he loop
---
F
---
Crow
---
No she doesn‚Äôt. I play at 500-800 trophies.
---
No, I think you are just good with him and skilled. Colt isn‚Äôt very top tier.
---

---
Also, I‚Äôm my opinion, Colt is very hot, or at least hotter than Bull.
---
Rico sees Frank as a villager Lmao
---
can you please remove ninja tara it is offensive as cultural stereotypes
---
ialready complained about it in that post
---
Issue is crows like to play like bull in low trophies
---
And how is that aggression rewarded? With reverse damage falloff. As you get higher up in trophies people will either abuse her damage mechanics or abuse your super (by getting ready to kill your landing area)
---
yeah i hate i when i spawn there are i dont do a lot of piercing damage
---
Rosa would like to know your location.
---
Take his phone and play his account
---
JUST ADD RED LAZER EYES MEME ON SHELLY THEN 10/10
---
Killing rosa no matter the context
---
I really want to watch it
---
‚Äúfetus position‚Äù lol
---
I CANT BELEIVE YOU HAVE DONE THIS
---
Thanks a lot! Yeah he is kinda messed up with the body proportions.
---
I was being sarcastic
---
Didn‚Äôt think this was already out there somewhere, so here it is!
---
When?
---
Those three days of Supercell‚Äôs event were both the most fun and most successful pushing days I‚Äôve ever had playing this game.
---
That looks pretty fun
---
Teamwork for the win
---
Good work bro!üëç
---
Ah shit, here we go again
---
I think the last thing they would do is making an Uncle Sam with German accent...
---
WAIT THATS...
---
Speed, just speed
---
Bake sale barley is actually a pretty good skin
---
It goes up if you only count the coastal states.
---
what's were those days? (sorry just started playing when the game went national)
---
Next brawler is legendary I'm calling it
---
Np. It was actually just a couple days ago where they had brawl ball for three days in a row instead of siege
---
the supreme teaming
---
I assume you are new then happy brawling
---
I was expecting hee to be a mythic brawler because her special abilities looks like mythic
---
Sister or Daughter. I'm thinking Sister
---
she isn't realessed and have more fan arts skins in game than Tara, wait Tara still with no skin =l
---
/r/Nice
---
The average is always 100.
---
An interesting thing about IQ score is that when people perform better, the metric changes so that the average is always 100. 
---
So if you get a 120 IQ and then a couple decades later everyone gets smarter but you are still the same, your IQ will go down without you getting stupider.
---
Maybe sister bc it‚Äôs been confirmed that Jessie is his daughter
---
#TheboxgoesBOOM!Brockk
---
Eh?
---
They are fixing it
---
Ikr
---
LMAO is ur name u/Donghoon is ugly? LMAOOO
---
I am more worried about Bull and Bibi because not only is bull older than her but the two of them are probably related, this relationship is either incest between siblings or father and daughter, not to mention the horrifying thoughts that come to mind when I think about the baseball bat and the bubble gum.
---
Crow would also run to get help because he is as fast as Leon and Mortis, but he looks faster
---
He is really fighting an old woman
---
Super tilted Pam
---
Me and the boys
---
Read the title please
---
Its not safe for work you can get fired if you caught watching brawl stars meme üòÇ
---
 There should be a fast forward button like in clash
---
It‚Äôs not that, it looks a bit gritty, that‚Äôs all
---
I know, i just thinked foi don't now that mira can be used for observe
---
EELLLLLLLLLLLL
---
Should have put to rockets on top and one on the bottom
---
Thats cuz hes invisible hardee har har
---
this better not be real
---
El Primo, Rosa, and Gene: Virgins
---
Yeet donghoon is bad exist too
---
I downvoted just because of the last word
---
Can we talk about the innovation of the 'fetus' position? Now you can stay hidden from both  the cops and the villain since your underage. However priests and uncles have a 100 percent chance to see you.
---
Ofc rosa need her shield to last 10 sec and 100% reduction
---
Alabama says there married
---
there‚Äôs nothing wrong with it but the positioning of the safes is that the top and bottom of the map is never going to be used
---
This isn‚Äôt bad! You should see me draw it‚Äôs basically a stick figure with an oval head ( not even straight sticks or perfect oval)
---
lmao

Please leave a edit or thing I should change to make this better

Thanks :) Pinky Spike

I think they're going to do a model rework on them before they make skins
---
Graphic design is your passion
---
I know this is a meme but come on guys, you were asking for a crow buff literally 1 months ago
---
Then just play showdown
---
Darryl gang unite

6.6k here. Still missing Piper, Mortis and all 3 legendaries
---
Oh yeah

Rosa: *You been runnin' round, runnin' round, runnin' round, throwing that dirt all on my name, 'cause you knew that I, knew that I,* ***knew that I'd call you up****...*
---
Are you fucking joking? You think anyone wants to team with Shelly? Mortis? Primo? Darryl? Bull? They‚Äôre all fucking weak outside of showdown. You can‚Äôt win without teaming means you have no skill toughen up
---
Remodel one day skin the next but make those the next 2 days plz

Nice post, u/good_grief_hes_naked
---
To me it just kinda makes sense for Plot for a potential Brawl Stars show/sorry mode. Bull And Pam had Colt and Jessie, but Bull left Pam for some other girl and She had BiBi OR just left because of financial reasons and joins Crow‚Äôs gang and BiBi was in it. After Shelly and Colt team up and try to take down some evil, Colt somehow learns that Bull is his father
---
Well I can't say you are wrong. It's your wish which game you want to play and as Frank said "if you don't like brawl in current state don't play it. If you don't have fun while playing a game you should not play that game" but I'll surely say one thing brawl stars is completely different game from clash royal. It's easy to bring updates for the games like clash royal. Brawl stars is a complex game and you just can't throw an update within every 15 day. According to me personally brawl stars is doing a good job in bringing updates though they are surely lacking some content but still update frequency is good. Talking about teaming it's genuine problem and the only way to avoid it is by not playing solo showdown ü§ôüòÇ ( also the community hasn't been able to help in this matter much). I don't agree with you on the case of matchmaking I think it's the best. I found it quite fare trophy wise but if you think you'll not get a Max opponent before 400 trophies then you are wrong. There are a lot of p2w players who Max there brawlers around 200 and since the game matchmakes on the basis of the trophies of the brawlers you'll have to face them but it's not always. For the skin thing GEDI- KOR himself said that he has no knowledge of creating 3-D artwork . If he had I can bet supercell would have hired him. It's easy to create a 2D image and it's much difficult for another 3D Artist to create a 3D character just using a 2D image. But still I believe within  2019 we'll surely see few Gedi-Kor's skin in game. Also brawl stars is the youngest kid of the family pls give him some time to grow up and mature a bit‚úåÔ∏è‚úåÔ∏è. You can always come back when you find brawl stars up to the mark until then enjoy your clash Royale üòä.

 ALSO I prefer COC over clash Royale and brawl stars.

I feel like there is a difference between Bull and Mortis taking it. Mortis requires skill to dash in and out while dodging. Poco tried to open a box but is forced to move because Bull deals more damage

keep your distance and try to poke at an enemy until you charge your super and try to pull in another player for a huge advantage in a critical moment in the game:)

This looks waaaaay too much like Dune Drift. I guess you tried to inspire yourself from it but that‚Äôs not a good idea when you want to do a map; you have to think about something that would make your map special, something that‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt already exist

F for the people to go up against these in battle

But did he win

idk if anyone else has had bad lag lately but this would probably make things worse
---
Nerf black guy

are you australian?

I feel like this could be a copypasta
---
Honestly, Clash Royale is much better.
---
They have constant updates, implementing new features and brawlers into the game. They also have used fan ideas, as I‚Äôm very sure Spooky Town was a highly liked fan idea. Meanwhile, Supercell won‚Äôt get off their feet and use at least SOME of GEDI-KOR‚Äôs skin ideas. It‚Äôs horrifying. The trophy road in Clash Royale rewards you much better while here you get whopping free boxes! Oh, don‚Äôt get me started on how you fixed the matchmaking and teaming in solo showdown. It‚Äôs basically like Clash Royale but at least you can counter the other deck with good plays! If 2/3 of your team stinks what do you do? I‚Äôm sorry if this provides controversy but I only played this game for 5 months and have already quit. I‚Äôve played Clash Royale for 2 years, quit for this, and realized how much better it is.
---
I'll be there as fast as I caaaannn üé∂
---
Thats actually a pretty good idea
---
Rarity does not mean anything. Barley is one of the most OP and is free.
---
that El primo either
---
Rosa better be as bad as poco now
---
Me first
---
When will it be released?
---
Maybe consecutive wasn‚Äôt the best word to use. 
---
Consecutive- ‚Äúfollowing continuously or uninterrupted‚Äù 
---
This wasn‚Äôt exactly 4 supers chained more just close in proximity to one another.
---
Or you could make a link from the News item on Brawl Stars to this post so that people come, see and vote more. But there would certainly be a lot of trash
---
Update today?
---
I see no nerfs here
---
Damn.
---
Wait, it says "New Event - Retropolis"
---
I hope that doesn't mean that this is just a temporary event, and that this is a permanent theme added.
---
They said their remodeling to help the creation of skins a lot of the original brawler models makes it hard for new skins
---
Same thing for me as a Poco main I either hunt them down or watch them die
---
Shes so totally metal bat from opm
---
I was the same.And I didn't play gem grab and others.But after 8.5k I started playing only trio and after 3 days I pushed my trofies yo 9k and after week to 9.5k.I'm happy that I started to play gem grab,brawl ball,bounty ,heist.But almost always I play with randoms and they play pretty good.Maybe because I have 18 rank on every brawler.
---
The carl buff will make him really good in close range combat when he is near a wall
---
Ngl, I'm sort of disappointed with this update. I know it's sort of rushed, but there's nothing much to keep the game fresh in it, just new skins and a new brawler, and another theme change. I'd also love some confirmation that Supercell is considering higher players. It's one thing to focus on beginners to improve retention, but giving maxed players more useless coins at 13k+ on trophy road and doing nothing about it for months seems out of touch. This game has so much potential, but I'm worried it's not reaching it due to a continued focus on player retention and polish.
---
Gos‚Äôtam‚Äôos
---
Similar to ‚ÄòBIBI‚ÄôCA
---
Just take part of the word, maybe the names are just subconsciously indirectly affecting the names thrown out in supercell HQ
---
It looks like the old ones who don't have a voice by now may not have in the future as well.
---
Thats looks fimilliar, hmmmmmmmmmmmm
---
I have to be honest. I'm not really a fan of that map. Tanks are op on the sides and ranged brawlers are good in the middle. It's the type of map that is basically a gold mine for bad randoms.
---
Why nerf rosa again? she's not strong anymore after her nerf now she's ganna be weaker?!?!

Me: PLEASE A POCO BUFF

Yes, thank you very much

Gimme his number, i wanna flex my legendaries on him.
---
Here's a detailed video about the new update.
---
https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ
---
As a frank main....HOW?????!?!?!
---
mortis is that you?
---
Same with rosa
---
It is like that only your internet is fine the maintainence break isn't over
---
Pss poco is good
---
I would‚Äôve liked more balance changes
---
I'm going to be honest .. 
---
This update isn't bad at all... But it's only me that was expecting a little more? 
---
Pls supercell, bring us a ^^^^^^^BIG update on next month. 
---
Something like a summer update idk
---
I dont really care THAT much about balance changes. But the amount of content in this update is very poor, all that Enigma brawl hype for nothing tbh...
---
when the support a creator feature will be launched ??
---
please answer :|
---
I'd have to disagree with the auto aim. It only would work well against one brawler. But if you're facing many, manual aiming would suit better
---
Good luck
---
APRIL FOOLS!
---
Your maps all look good, well done! Just some small things that bothered me:
---
On the first map, you could delete some cactuses on the middle, it would allow for more long range brawlers
---
On the two last maps, you put really biiiig walls, and I‚Äôm afraid that, if 6 players played on it, it would lack a little bit of space
---
Otherwise, great job!
---
Ye-yeah like what the heck this guy is mean
---
Brawlstars: Rosa has a voiceover now!
---
Tara: Seriously?
---
Yeah, to each their own but I really enjoyed that map. Darryl was also good there.
---
Same as the Brawl Talk said some old maps were returning, they didn‚Äôt do that either.
---
119 gems?
---
U gonna make rosa be soo dam bad
---
üòÇüòÇAgreed! But I don‚Äôt play a lot with randoms, si I didn‚Äôt try to make a good map for bad randoms, I tried to do a map that would change the pro level gameplay
---
Once you see it you CANT UNSEE IT
---
 there's sub for everything üòÇ
---
Bots auto-aim &gt; Yours
---
H.O.W¬ø
---
You don't need to hide so many things bud...just hide your name.
---
But every update is the same üí©, nothing interesting at high trophies, the only thing they do is adding broken Brawlers to the game...
---
Cool "Roht" skin üòÖ
---
It releases today.
---
I played since global release
---
Agreed
---
I usually wreck with poco. Gotta know how to play him I guess. Lol.
---
r/ohokayapologizesareneeded r/stillgeneisamistake
---
its a joke relax Poco by himself is pretty bad but with a good comp he can be ok but Rosa is basically Jesus not to offend you Christians btw
---
I've played since 6 november 2018, and I can say that the old Brawlers were very cool.
---
There is 1 balance change, a reverting of an interaction change that will affect 1/100 matches and a bug fix. The last update at least had balance changes and wasn't overhyped
---
Accurate as all hell
---
u/Frank_Supercell, u/Dani_Supercell, please answer.
---
I was joking and just trying to add humor to this comment (which did not work) but yeah he is bad and that is fact and all I hope for is that Poco can get his Star Power and his Reload speed a nice and good buff
---
Yes ;) I've posted something like this, take a look ;)
---
You may have the reverse card, but i have the N-word pass.
---
I agree that it looks dumb but that Pantene hair **THICC**
---
No, think. You can‚Äôt try a skin if it hasn‚Äôt been released yet. For example. The maple barley skin is only being released on the 2 year anniversary, previously you could test the skin by a bug, before the skin was released, now you can‚Äôt
---
Yea
---
What would you prefer they do?
---
Robot barley doesnt really have a gender and sakura spike is another species.
---
The problem is that the night which mortis is damn ugly skin.
---
And why do you assume we have a problem with transgenders.
---
op probably had footage from before but took a little longer editing the video and exporting it to then post it, which would take roughly from 5 to 15 minutes approximately
---
If it's pre update how does carl have a skin?
---
YES. It‚Äôs been LIKE THIS FOR 1.5 HOURS ALREADY!!!
---
It took more than a hour i‚Äôm wondering it too.
---
The update already happened.
---
so true lmao
---
from who?
---
YES ITS BEEN LIKE THIS FOR 1.5 HOURS ALREADY
---
Nope, "Locked skins" are those who are announced (like Shiba Nita was announced 4 days before release) as skin, and there was a bug were you could try it out before release
---
That new Barley Skin would've been great with Piper.
---
Ryan said there is a server issues and they are fixing it
---
you can... you  can‚Äôt do that glitch like penny nomore... but you can still do it with old skins not new skins
---
Wow, imagine if you see the bot grabbing the bolts and leveling up.
---
Why's he got a villager nose?
---
maybe the big event has yet to come? becouse retropolis was a big disapointment, i mean it got teased in such a way that it looked like a big event but till now it just looks like a new theme.
---
it‚Äôs out... now we wait ok ....
---
na ur being hacked
---
Impact font, censorship and shitty crop
---
nobody will never know ... soo .. everybody will know soon?
---
jeez,brawl stars was just a normal game, and now there are alot of secrets that are untold...
---
Bibi is coming (very) soon , not today , idk
---
How explain m8
---
An epic usually costs 170 gems, but  I think Bibi will be on sale for 139 or 149 gems
---
This is made with mematic
---
Yup
---
Ohh, I'm short a bit, thank you!!!
---
The update already happened, they had a 2nd break to fix something.
---
oh oof
---
What are you using man?
---
A proper assasin has to prioritize his targets. Squishies over tanks. The only moment an assasin should ever go for a tank if the target is low on health. An assasin should be able to burst a tank so easily
---
Lol
---
Nerf crow
---
This is reason why I'm not very good at pushing trophies. I stubbornly chase anyone who wrongs me even if I might die in the process. So satisfying when I outplay them though.
---
Thats because in CR is other mechanic, you can get that multiple times but for leveling up.
---
from who tho?
---
I love the number 69
---
Or you and everyone like you could  just stop parroting these cringy, disrespectful ass memes. But based on your response I‚Äôm gonna assume that you‚Äôre like 15 so nothing will be changing anytime soon lmao
---
Knowing supercell there will be another way.

its out for the last hour at least.. we just cant play it xD
---
Killed rosa?
---
Yup. Getting a legendary in CR isn't that much fun
---
How did they manage to do that to Rosa tho?
---
Teamers spinning lol
---
True. It is well known in marketing that if you scare away your die hard player base, you'll end up going bankrupt.

Shiba nita,christmas nita and panda nita

Lol no

This is the longest maintenance break!!!!

Getting a CR leggie= getting a BS super rare

Yes a cactus cant talk but a cactus can walk

Defenitely the case here, i would smash your phone before they see your browser history!

Ik, kids think they are grown men saying it because it's "TH3 53X NUM83R"

Np

And just out of curiosity, how could you use locked screen with the bug before it was fixed ?

Hey what you say about mortis

I mean tara has pink toilet paper covering her face so it would be weird if she had a voice

The fourth fire is ready while you shot the 3 first so for me it makes sense for him to have 4 rockets

Give suggestions to improve

I have to go to school in 1.5 hrs.I want to at least try the update out.
---
Android bro, for some reason it's smoother there. Don't know if that makes sense lol
---
Excuse me, where is Tara skin and voice? Can you please delete Tara?

Lol...... They released the update. But they found a issue to fix &amp; they took 2hrs but it's still in Maintanence Break wtf

Brawl Talk - Maintenance break for over 2 hours?!? What?!?
---
dude half this thread was already about undertale
---
as if I would believe you
---
I though it was good and it should nt be removed
---
awesome!
---
Terraria mobile 1.3 still takes longer lol 
---
4 years
---
Preach
---
2 hours of maintenance
---
I feel like people are taking the dev team for granted. After all, what game developers release updates every month.
---
If we are getting new content each month, people are bound to expect they wont be that big. And the dev team isnt even that big so its amazing how they can pump out new content each month.
---
Quick.
---
I tried it in the mid maintenance break you could play for like 15 min
---
He is so dumb
---
I guess you didn't realise I was sarcastic. How can you miss that?
---
Maybe go do something else ü§î
---
yes
---
Oof
---
Sad
---
Oh the irony. The smallest update has the longest maintenance break. Great meme btw.
---
Maybe they succ for you i got like 5 or 6 brawlers from them
---
ah..
---
It‚Äôll end when they‚Äôre done playing some matches without fandoms üòÇ
---
I agree, Piper will be strong here.
---
Thankyou :)
---
Yeah lol I appreciate their work, but they said that‚Äôs gonna be a fast one, and I‚Äôve been waiting and waiting
---
Use /s after your jokes so i can underestand shit
---
tap tap tap tap

How?
---
Removed - DO NOT SUBMIT POSTS WITH TITLES IN ALL CAPS. CAPS LOCK IS CRUISE CONTROL FOR COOL
---
Finally, Carl gets buffed (^ÔΩ°^)
---
Ty for the advice
---
Sorry for re-upload last one was bit sh¬£t
---
But the problem is this new maintenance break not that before one
---
Yeah I guess. He's kind of in a weird spot with the current meta. The star power does make him rather good at surviving, but I chose to put him there because the his best attribute is still killing throwers.
---
again?
---
The hell we gonna use club mail for if there's nothing to do in a club lol
---
I don‚Äôt think he is saying that. But kids being on reddit? That‚Äôs not really right imo. As a user of the site, I would absolutely block my kids from using it.   
---
Maybe nowadays that they are censoring reddit a lot more and trying to turn it into a social media platform it isn‚Äôt as bad as 10 years ago. But there‚Äôs still a lot of stuff on reddit that kids shouldn‚Äôt be seeing.
---
Sorry that they have work to do and you don‚Äôt
---
He do be looking kinda quirky tho
---
Yea XD
---
Monkeys managing the servers were probably underpaid in bananas and lashed out. Hopefully they can hire more monkeys ASAP and get the servers up
---
All those bat iterations and Supercell decides to not give it a face at all

My god XD

r/HelpTara

Now what? there isn't anything new
---
Take the -3 trophies
---
No i was able to play the game for a few minutes before the maintenance
---
Maintenance is over now you can stop complaining because a subreddit is filled with the same topic...
---
Please do it
---
hey man at least put the nsfw mark here
---
Truth be told I actually win that game
---
Frank - Attack delay mechanic.
---
&gt;Not that great, imo. Lucky to get milkshake and backstabbing ppl who is at war :)
---
HAHAHAHA
---
Eh
---
Nobody cares.
---
Global.. i like like
---
Damn, you really thought this out
---
Yes it is lagging. Just lost 10 trophies on siege :(
---
Akshually, Bibi is being released in a day. Quite fast compared to the previous releases (carl and rosa took a week)
---
Now it finally works. But Im 100 years old now :(
---
I always knew she looked strangely asian
---
Did not see this being mentioned before. If you use the normal attack and before it lands, use the ult, the normal attack will miss. Don't know if a bug, or it is just the mechanic of hers.
---
Not all Spikes are clever
---
I have an idea about that but atleast they could have told about the expected time on reddit or Twitter
---
Yeah, quite happy about that!
---
I think Carl and Rosa took even longer, only they got visible in the shop a week before release!
---
One HUGE-ASS mood right here XDXD
---
They can't tell you the expected time if they don't know what it is.
---
the only thing i looked fo4wqrd for were balance changes and there's only 3...
---
at least she its better than genes voice
---
It was Posted more than a week ago. He waited Just to post this and there being no evidence
---
Ya but the person's joke was stolen
---
What about Rico? He has the least amount of HP in the game but he is one chonky boi
---
Lol it happens to me too at which point I choose a high dps brawler and get it over with, I wish matchmaking gets teammates at the same overall trophy count as me but from experience it seems to be applied only in solo/duo showdown
---
uh.. okay
---
This would be super cool in the game.
---
I love that they announced the brawler and just instantly released it without us having to wait 2 weeks
---
Exactly!
---
whenever the bubble go back to her she can use her bat to redirect the bubblegum again
---
i find this to be an interesting idea
---
Ah shit here we go again

Play store bug,the update is like 20-50 mb but your play store is displaying it wrong

Sorry, thought he was saying specifically bunny penny and not just as an example

Thanks man!

---
But eArrAPe iS fUnNY
---
creep
---
I know, just finish a brawler before adding
---
Ya I know , I uninstalled and downloaded it from Google but still it shows 9mb update which is not getting finished.
---
wow
---
You have to add the link
---
Rosa is my name, Botany is my game‚Äù
---
Why?
---
where's teaming
---
loli hentai inst okay but if your talking a difference  between fat slobs beating to a picture of a loli compared to the cesspool of degenerates that actually want to cause sexual harm towards real children that's its pretty massive step between the two. id rather have someone beat it to hentai lolis then real kids. all im saying is that giving an person that doesn't exist a age really dumb. anime a perfect example of drawing  a 20 yr person then "saying oh shes 15 with huge tits and ass oh btw this this little 5yr old girl is really a 1000000 yr old demon goddess" now are you saying that's okay to beat off to the 1000000 yr demon goddess because canonically that's her age despite her looking like a 5 yr old girl ?
---
It‚Äôs against the rules of this subreddit
---
Name of website?
---
oh wow as if noone knows dumbass
---
spike doesn‚Äôt need a voiceover tbh
---
Tara has a mysterious vibe about her and is better without a voice.
---
I feel like giving Leon an annoying kid voice, which is most likely what‚Äôll happen, would just make him obnoxious.
---
My boi spike doesn‚Äôt need a voice to be swag.
---
Daryll could use a Pirate-like voice.
---
That rico's trophies

og

weve seen this reposted a thousand times before so please refrain from posting shit like this ever again

Fuck!!!! The required trophies in this club is 6500... Im around 4700
---
sure
---
Brawlstats it is an app on apple ( not sure about android) where you can keep track of your brawler trophies you own trophies you club trophies and your in game friends trophies
---
Oh great! Then sad...I dont want coin packs
---
My life is a joke
---
This is great!
---
r/lostredditors

Okay that's fine, I was just offering a counterpoint to his assertion that the voice was only trying to appeal to kids.

I'm under the required trophies for this club üòìüòìüòì
---
How dare you post that kind of stuff!?!?
---
This is a Christian Brawl Stars server.
---
Begone unholy child
---
Thanks!
---
I think it's more so the fact that a lot of us are die hard Supercell fans and we want them to succeed. This game, atleast for me and my friends just hasn't lived up to the hype and we all want to keep playing but there seems to be no incentive
---
NP
---
She isn‚Äôt a gem carrier, which means you‚Äôll be playing her in a lane, and her range sucks for lane fighting, as it isn‚Äôt longer for better range and the fact that it‚Äôs wide doesn‚Äôt help in a 1v1. She exerts very little pressure against medium range brawlers as they can easily stay back and chip and their supers are better for sng than hers, making them winning their lane even more rewarding. I don‚Äôt think you can feasibly use her as a gem carrier either because of how short her range is, so she‚Äôd get chipped down by Pam or bo and gene, and she wouldn‚Äôt be able to touch Jessie or penny and especially their turrets. Her range is fine dude. It isn‚Äôt as big of a deal as you think it is
---
Back then it was easier to unlock them
---
if you move the robot in one of the openings you can do 10 or so.
---
Congrats!
---
old coins for me as well! never noticed it wow, devs should know this
---
there are so many low level &amp; rude comments surrounding in Reddit now... :(
---
why they so immature?  i don't think BS is just a KID'S game.
---
 loli hentai isn't ok and you got a good point there.
---
But giving a character an age is quite important. For example, in Brawl Stars the devs have to know if Piper is 13 or 23 in many stuff, for example when they give them a voice, skins and characteristics.
---
Are these the actual effects
---
#SKIN DONATION
---
What's that text that is faded across the pic is it just a watermark or something else?
---
They are still hated here
---
I just care tht sometimes that someone is always dont know how to stay away from another brawler because that the other reason why rosa got nerf other than her supe
---
You can notice it from the spelling in most posts too
---
There is an error , supercell is fixing it now you can‚Äôt sent club mail until the next maintenance
---
this is as accurate as "cavern churn labeled"
---
What app did you use to do this? Message me
---
aww cute
---
Hype
---
Why is there so much teaming on this map? Any particular reason?
---
the big chungus one not the rosa
---
Thanks a ton
---
I click rosa to play her on brawl ball, she speaks um like REEEEEE
---
Yeah, that makes sense. The Thicco memes got the best of me.
---
this needs more upvotes!!!
---
Yes, and you know what? If you play with randoms, you're a random yourself. By calling then bad, you're calling yourself bad.
---
It was made a long time ago it‚Äôs fine
---
In the game files they were 80 gems.
---
Drag the super away and back then hold when you relase you wont auto aim beacouse you already aimed so hold it and let it go then quickly hit the attack butten. For a bonus hold the super buttan during the attack so you can look like you are supering
---
I think by Event they mean the menu changing its look like it did during Golden Week. The map themes should stay.
---
Club mail is QoL
---
if u run in a circular motion around it (distance from turret depends on speed) u can easily dodge every shot
---
WHY WOULD YOU RUIN THAT SACRED PLACE
---
The bottom two layers are the same. If you remove the particle effects on top they are exactly the same.
---
Boi u litteraly one of the carts, carl
---
Are u actually
---
we got siege btw
---
Its funny when there are 3 seconds left and the carts block all their shots. Then u spin on them lol
---
If bibi doesn't get a Japanese school girl sukeban uniform, I'll riot.
---
Well the previous meta (before this balance change) was honestly just Carl, Gene and Rosa
---
Wait, what happened?
---
A level 10 pro and a 3 trophy noob. That is a great combination. Well done, supercell
---
eh, atleast SC didn‚Äôt nerf him
---
Where though?
---
isn't a emulator
---
an*
---
Just shoot at a wall...
---
Crow is strong.
---
How many trophies are you dude? Even more awful balances :D
---
duh
---
Cool, 2 of the 3 new skins goes to brawlers that already have multiple skins. 
---
How bout some skins for classic, now even retro players like Bo, Daryl, Piper, Pam, Leon????
---
I tried that too, maybe I'm just bad...
---
this is fake
---
It's cause Clash Royale is already in end game phase, &amp; BS is just getting started. &amp; same, i stopped playing CR Looong ago
---
*oh no I can‚Äôt spam auto aim and kill everyone anymore! I have to actually aim!*
---
#*WE NEED TO BUFF LEON!!!!*
---
His sp is good but UNDERWHELMING
---
This is real thing
---
This didnt age well
---
She can't do unlimited super, also the damage is good, she is a close range brawler with delayed attacks, so..
---
i tried looking his profile up and it said that it didn't exist
---
only voice I‚Äôd accept for Leon
---

I don't know about the skins but the "brawler donation" means donation of PowerPoints
---
But also gene
---
Will get nerfed soon
---
 Are you stupid??!! Stupid kid!!! Minecarts are the best Element in BrawlStars!!!
---
nah
---
i barley laghed
---
[deleted]
---
That means randoms
---
Acc phinishing means trying to claim and get acc back .If u ever messed up with recovery info ,u are gonner.
---
Yea I know, I just had a different idea
---
Supercell is probably best company when it comes to free mobile games, especially brawl stars.
---
Rosa is my name, copycatting is my game
---
Lvl 10 shelly and Mike at 270 trophies means easy win
---
Yea carl now when he is spamming next to the wall causes 10000 damage in 1 sec 10000*30% (rosa super damage defeating)= 3000 = if he is pro he can defeat rosa
---
Are *you* retarted, kid?
---
Dont you know how Supercell earns money? Well, from people buying gems. By buying gems, you help Supercell keep the game running.
---
 It's a FREE game with no ads, and buying stuff is not necessary. You dont have to do it. But calling the ones that do so and make players like you able to play this game for FREE for retarted is really stupid.
---
If you dont want Supercell to earn money, why are you here? 
---
That guy is right and this post is pointless.
---
thx for this great advice
---
Thank you so much!!
---
The game will start and you are still stuck there. Happens a lot recently after the update. Heck, it's too laggy
---
For doing what?
---
internet explorer for Brawl Stars!
---
Contacted supercell about it. Hopefully they get back soon.
---
But he is weak in current meta
---
But rosa deals 1300 damage per punch so no chances to Carl üëå
---
I wAnT mY mOmMy
---
The game is still new.. Give them time
---
What's Pikachu?
---
I like em big
---
because the model suffers a total change, has a new standing animation and a new attack animation maybe?
---
I agree, it's weird to add Bibi an own cathegory. She isn't that special
---
start farming boxes. now.
---
Pikachu is a pokemon
---
The #enigma stuff, I guess I can see people getting more excited than usual for an update... But it's just a hashtag, if somebody blew it out of proportion in their minds I feel like it's their fault yknow? My original comment is a lot angrier than it needed to be and I'm kinda embarrassed but keeping it cuz I deserve any looks of disbelief. 
---
The point of it stands though, imo. I think it's a great update. I don't buy into any hype and I have no expectations despite spending almost $1,000 (like an impatient idiot) on this game.
---
How can I be part of a gang?
---
*Carl*

#ILLUSION 100

1v1 mode would be luck dependant, you just can‚Äôt win certain match ups for instance shelly vs bull. Its a terrible idea.

Why is there White Noise in the background ear raping me
---
every 0 nanoseconds

Your trophies
---
Ok I kinda lost my phone for a while so could I see em
---
It's filled with kids who would give someone a blow for brawler buffs and attention

Fun fact: I Spend them on Mortis just because he looked cool
---
Already out tho

I want this as a Ricochet skin so badd
---
Wow
---
This looks like something from r/imsorryjon
---
You can just here the bat say YEET
---
Its really fucking annoying
---
Short answer: no.

I made a post like this one and people told me I was just copying a post posted 3 months before üò≠
---
Haha, I love the brain; looks sweet! May I suggest Cupcake Darryl or Baseball Bibi?
---
LMao
---
Wow you also did pixel art with the background?
---
I feel you
---
Haha.. Thanks for the suggestion!
---
no actually four times
---
*Hum* gemmer *hum*
---
Oh, whoops. Sorry. I can't even use Club Mail as it just shows some words: TID\_CLAN\_RESPONSE\_111
---
:)
---
Even undercover officers who backstab the baddies?
---
I have no ideas for Tara, bit leon could have a Royal ghost skin, you know, they both go invisible?
---
It's cuz it's double trouble gum
---
Do one for primo, where you collect 10 gems then die as quickly as possible
---
If you didnt, they would not have chcecked your account maybe
---
haven't though about that, if that's the case, hen I don't have any ideas
---
what-
---
Probably. Well rip my account lol
---
Exactly
---
I agree, because when in actual gameplay, even though the bubble has a range of 40 tiles, it will rarely ever hit more than once unless on a map with several walls. And most people will probably just use it to finish off someone with low health in an actual fight.
---
Ok, no problems

Dinamikes getting what they deserve

Update for you guys. Supercell responded and it turns out he was account sharing and he will not be unbanned.
---
why that gets downvoted tho
---
This isn‚Äôt the sub for this.
---
Well done
---
How do we know you're not lying? I don't want to upvote for someone that was actually phishing accounts.
---
The mod no longer works after the update, will you guys fix this? Thank you.
---
Lmao I died
---
Don't kill me, this is my opinion, but I think Leon is just better silent
---
It will be fixed don't worry
---
O \_ O
---
Thank you! I loved those old models! Will be looking forward to it!
---
Hello internet explorer
---
What club is he in?
---
I was thinking that too
---
No, sounds more like he wasn‚Äôt aware sharing his account would get him banned so he thought it was just him trying to switch his email.
---
Hola supercell, quiero ablar sobre brawl star, bajenle el da√±o o saquen a bull y tambien dicen que juego con gente de mis copas es mentira cuando jurgo sobrevivensia siampre ai alguien con no asi y tengo 2115 copas areglen eso y mr llamo en brawl star: brahian :u
---
https://youtu.be/TH-uIMjS8hc
---
I didn‚Äôt think it was very funny. It overused sound effects and it seems as if it tried too hard to be funny. My advice would be to maybe add some more visual effects and less sound effects.
---
Hello, I want to make a suggestion, could do in the new update that the Skins of the Brawlers also have their own Avatar, I think that people who buy skin, we also deserve to have a skins avatar, I am one of those who always buy their  beautiful skins.  and I will continue doing.
---
 I hope you can consider putting that option, thank you very much.
---
I thought it would be funny , but no one fucking understood it . This subreddit really is full of extremely dumb kids who downvote without under anything
---
Great skin!

Some tanks would go, and there would be one surviving most likely. Once the brawlers has to go to the middle because of the poison, they would die to the Bull, Shelly, Rosa, Primo, etc. Also, what if the Super didn‚Äôt move the brawler, like Penny, Rosa, Poco, Frank, etc.
---
You're welcome
---
I'm nice , how are u
---
150 for an epic and 109 for discount I think
---
I would buy racer Carl if it was discounted as well
---
Leons: phew I‚Äôm safe
---
Supercell: not for long
---
Really good drawing
---
#YEE
---
I can
---
He said, others did it and didn't get banned, so he thought he wouldn't either. The way he said it made me think he knew it could, but didn't think it would actually be inforced.
---
This poor guy :(
---
Do you think I should get BIBI or the Carl skin?
---
I heard fucking is my game lol
---
So, wizard barley, but his main attack can‚Äôt go over walls and he has a different star power?
---
Its world of tanks blitz
---
Bruh
---
u/jacklaroche look at my Rosa. Is that called maining a brawler? And I thought I was dumb
---
Ah this thread feels just like /r/2007scape mod smack down all over again.
---
That‚Äôs your home page, right
---
she says "botany is my game"
---
She says, 'Rosa is my name, Botany is my game'...
---
I just went back to two button for now
---
E V E R Y  D A Y  W E  STRAY  FURTHER  FROM   GOD
---
At least we don't have to wait a week for her to come out ; she'll come out at 9:00 in the morning tomorrow, so be patient.
---
Alright. But I still think Carl won't like it üòÇ
---
*insert what the fuck have you brought upon this cursed land picture*
---
I like that you put the flair "Event" there.
---
Bbib definitely
---
Chill, I ain't downvoting anyone's comments.
---
Im just like ur friend, got leon at 1.4k trophies!
---
Move on, there‚Äôs already a new brawler, lol
---
Has someone thought about making a Baseball Bibi skin? I love this skin btw.
---
This is simply misinformation for upvotes. 
---
It was never verified that ‚ÄúZach‚Äù was indeed the name of the account that got banned for 2 days. I did reach out to the OP on that occasion to confirm, but never got a response back. [Proof](https://reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/b5barm/_/ejenfcu/?context=1)
---
Also highly unlikely OP‚Äôs account was banned for simply being named ‚ÄúZach‚Äù, but I guess we‚Äôll never find out.
---
It does matter if it's clear that the account was logged into from different locations in seconds.  
---
Anyways, take these posts with a grain of salt.  Most of the time there is a reason and usually the ban was justified.
---
btw im a huge fan of cory and no hate was intended
---
u/Frank_Supercell So it was you who captured Ryan! ü§£
---
I have 4 boxes saved up
---
Moe and Joe
---
Sure. Let‚Äôs do duos
---
You know what lewd means?
---
why the fuck do you only have 11 upvotes this subreddit's total BS  
---
no pun intended  
---
jokes aside though this really needs more attention jesus christ
---
Awesome
---
Does Carl have a different voice because default is awful
---
Except as we saw this was a legit ban due to account sharing per official Supercell. So case closed.
---
You've downvoted every single one of my replies to you so far.
---
How did u get her to look like a toy?!
---
Dynamike is my name,
---
Dynamite is my game
---
Give is a Tara buff+skin.
---
Omg
---
Your choice, depends what you want.
---
Add me. We‚Äôll push. I‚Äôve got all brawlers rank 20
---
I swear I am not the reason they have 0 rep.
---
join my club. Red Warriors 90K trophies  but id rather brawl ball
---
it‚Äôs actually so slick when u kill someone with his super and he just slides along like a badass
---
Ah shit , here we go (investigating) again
---
tru
---
Those bastards
---
Dang you suck, you don‚Äôt even have crow at 200
---
Definitely wrong quote.
---
Penny:i am joke for you
---
Haha
---
You might care about karma a *little* too much, you know?
---
carl be like  
---
"HEY, THAT'S MY LINE"
---
For example, Mortis looks young like every other brawler but he's probably 1000 or something :p
---
Mustache on a female skin.... so wrong
---
Is it normal that I get extremely depressed when someone downvotes me ?
---
I was sleeping so I really couldn't care less
---
Underrated
---
When Bo was epic
---
i thought sla had some print lines as well XD i've never actually seen an sla print but it looks super dope
---
You can only test her. Go to the characters &amp; all the way down you'll see her, just hit "try" she will be released at midnight.
---
I wasn‚Äôt around for that but I got it the second it went worldwide (Australia) . There‚Äôs a reason why they removed that and I‚Äôm glad they did because it doesn‚Äôt sound like a good idea
---
And you post it acting like people will think it‚Äôs funny? What a joke
---
It fits for poco so well
---
r/thanksihateit
---
Bumping this.  I don't get why this post (and other similar posts) is being downvoted.  It certainly takes away from the integrity of the solo match.
---
I've been experiencing this frequently on my Colt Solo runs recently.  Almost impossible to get trophies when I'm literally playing against 7-8 members of a team.  Thanks to the match recap, I have a video of all 7-8 "teaming" on a solo battle.
---
Still nothing that can be done about this?
---
&gt;!test&lt;!
---
Nah you know this sub will be full of these posts
---
Happy 1st Birthday!
---
Rico vs Bibi = Rick vs negan
---
Were you here before global? Memes were everywhere.  There weren‚Äôt as many original or creative memes but there were a ton of memes. Nearly all top of all time post were memes.
---
We dont need a tara voiceover. It will ruin the character, she wont be that mysterious anymore. (or spike wtf). And leon would just be weird. Darryl? Idk how tf he would sound.
---
So false
---
Ur saying the ball bounced 2 times on the door and then went to the wall in front bouncing off to the camera
---
TF2 scout skin?
---
It was a great idea. Actually. Best modifier in the game. Teaming was non existent. You had to fight. No bush camping. They removed it because too many idiots were confused as to why they were losing health. Not because it was bad. It was awesome.
---
Crazy Brits and their dates. Who puts DD/MM/YY? Its CLEARLY MM/DD/YY.
---
I have a video of 7-8 guys "teaming" in one solo battle.  How is that not considered cheating?
---
That's literally not what he was asking ?
---
That‚Äôs the point
---
#then a leon figures out whats up
---
!spoiler hi there!
---
Ohhh lol
---
I disagree, I‚Äôm happy with where the game is at currently. There are a few changes I‚Äôd make like to Rosa and the standard brawl boxes don‚Äôt give enough money I think but overall I think it‚Äôs balanced well
---
I don't think clan mail works. When I try to send it gives some raw code message
---
Happy birthday Frank the most genuine teaser thanks
---
they gave me to gems and i don't know why üòêüòê at first i thought that's a skin cause i saw YouTubers getting them
---
Poco is my name and playing music is my game
---
Wanna have a bad time?
---
The map won‚Äôt work
---
Happy birthday Frank the most genuine teamer
---
Can I get the code as well. Totally going to steal it. I mean...
---
I figured it would need some tweaks to the code but I wanted a bigger, better mode with more strategy behind it. I feel that at this point, the game is more luck based in some aspects and I hope that this will bring more of a change
---
Jessie remembers me of scout
---
Oh ok cool
---
Yeah, and if YOU paid attention he is still banned so that point does not do anything. :)
---
Yes, Thank you for posting this, I really get annoyed when people kept repeating posts that hundreds of other players have already posted.
---
When your parents are rich but you suck at the game.
---
r/mutegang
---
1. It was in the patch notes
---
2. A lot of YouTubers covered it
---
3. Wrong flair?
---
Scratch is just block programming. Not much skill needed
---
Debatable
---
Homerun should make the brawlers spin when they get hit by it
---
Its part of the update
---
damn,that camel toe
---
Pam's projectiles shoot in a side-to-side pattern but the projectiles themselves travel straight in one direction
---
Don't you dare!
---
I mean....
---
Rather be a smart ass than a dumb ass. Like you. Who‚Äôs not maxed. But thinks he is.
---
All my brawlers are rank 20. 12.5k total. I don‚Äôt play solo or duos anymore. Not worth the aggravation.
---
Why, why, why? ^is ^this ^skin ^so ^good
---
that bottom left picture will happen regardless of how strong the champ is.
---
Well looks the like bat is trying to team. #StopTheSpin
---
New for global players. It‚Äôs well over a year old.
---
Would you mind also sending me the code
---
No. 3 legendaries is already extremely grindy. Maybe 1 more mythic but 3 legendaries is where it needs to stay for a LONG time.
---
Because people liked the meme, but doesn't have anything to comment
---
this is bullshit
---
Except it actually does a lot of damage
---
Bro not is not enough you cant even unlock a RARE brawler we need atleast 150 brawl boxes what is up with you guyz are you a nooob
---
Once you know its weakness, its easy to be good using Frank.
---
But yes, its just my opinion, Frank was my Second Brawler Rank 20. The First was Piper.
---
And I know your point, there are no "best Brawler", only good players with them.
---
Frank! Also penny was released on the same day
---
Where are the new map objects???
---
How is this funny? ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Or your comment &gt; yourname &gt; chnage user flair
---
I‚Äôve been going through this sub since Jan 2018 and less than 25% of the posts were memes. Memes were exploding since global
---
He's using pygame.
---
that was my birthday too...üòîüòî
---
New brawler bibi
---
Consistency my friend, consistency
---
ü¶ÄFrank won't respond to this threadü¶Ä
---
ikr lol
---
y e s

I can try to recreate his program if you'd like.
