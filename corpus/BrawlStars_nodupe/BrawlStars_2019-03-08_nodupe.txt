Is there a possibility of getting a random Legendary brawler in Daily Deals? If yes, then how much will it cost?
---
---
---
You go to put the 5v5 mode?
---
Will clubs be any use in the future(like in Clash Royale, where they have clan wars)or something similar to clan wars? Or where in the past Clash Royale used to have a clan chest, where the more trophies you get in a week the higher the reward in the clan chest and you can even call it the club box.

Are you planning on adding "emojis" or any kind of button dialogues to communicate with teammates during the Waiting Menu or in-game?

Out of any of the fan brawlers made by the community, do any of you have personal favorites?

i dont know

It's 3 nerfs

Needs more jpg
---
This looks like some strange elsa gate stuff...
---
Yeah Supercell doesn't give crow justice...
---
No prob I'm personally a mid tier spender because Brawl is a game where I feel that even if I stop the progress won't just disappear since I'm not spending but the lvl difference is a pain I'm personally every brawler 300 at around 5 to 6 with one star power for my Colt but seeing friends who started the game later than me with 5 star powers and every brawler is rather disheartening.
---
He moved to another project.
---
They plan to introduce maps to the game of apps and not just the internet?
---
Best strategy for 10 iq ever
---
thank u
---
What does IKE stand for?
---
Lmao üòÇ trueee
---
Both are Spanish and both have the same skin color not on that but el primo means the cousin so yeah :/
---
Oh.. u/jumpei_supercell (checking his profile)
---
In any battle Royale game their will be characters that fit into an easier play style. This easier play style makes them more abundant in your matches; which gives the appearance that ‚Äúthe brawler must be overpowered if everyone is using him‚Äù. This is the case with tanks currently (except Pam; she just is a beast). While primo and bull certainly shine when you‚Äôre too close to them; they‚Äôre very easily countered by a large portion of brawlers; making them not as useful the higher the trophy range you‚Äôre at. 
---
If you‚Äôre concerned about players dodging your shots via walls or pillars; that‚Äôs frankly more opinion based. In the AMA they did briefly talk about adding a Free for all death match like event; where perhaps this could be applicable. But the walls and covers are essential to this game. Without them; certain brawlers would have the ability to completely overpower other brawlers on certain maps.

Not many people play Brawl, and even less play RotMG. You sir are a treasure.
---
True. Honestly I think the best way would be to have it so you can‚Äôt use your super when you have the flag. 
---
i have an idea
---
every game is feast or famine no mods
---
I feel the same about Mortis
---
I know. But that didn't really say anything about the character's backstory
---
Once you get to above 300 on a certain brawler the matchmaking is based more on that brawlers cups. Before 300 it‚Äôs +5 -4. As long as you can win more then 50% of your games you will gain cups as after it‚Äôs +5 -5 . In hearthstone it is similar you gain a star lose a star although there is win streaks but there is a lot of rng in hearthstone you can easily have a much higher winrate in brawl stars from 900-1000 its +2 -7 meaning you have to win 4 times to make up one loss and many players have gotten brawlers above 1000. Showdown does have some randomness with the spawn and boxes.  
---
When does he come out
---
Its no longer el primo.....
---
Its EL MUSTACHOOOOO
---
Good meme

Happy cake day, btw.

the reason i dont like these maos is bc its to ez to escape from a figt cuz if the springs, downvote from meüòï

Yea I feel that. I haven't spent a dime, started since global launch and it's really tempting to just buy a least the character unlocks or something just to catch up to everyone who is already Max account.

---
Hey! First of all, Supercell, love the work that you are doing. An amazing and fun game :)
---
Will there be any ‚Äúfriendly‚Äù events? For instance, like a safe room where we can just run around as brawlers and chat, etc.? Maybe throw some kind of a brawl talk, but within the game. Hope you understand what I mean!
---
skins sell mate. i love em. if a good one comes out id spend gems on it over getting legendaries. still waiting for crow and spike yet i have lots of skins lol
---
I'm 4700 with no epics, mythics, and legendaries. You're EXTREMELY lucky to have Pam.
---
Hello there. Considering consistency is the key for success it would be great if you guys considered having the option for a locked static joystick. I find the current setups not very solid and a lot of times I find myself with no screen for keep dragging the joystick...
---
Thanks in advance.
---
You are right plague doctor is the best skin idea for crow
---
Are you going to rework Bo's main attack? (and maybe super)
---
The damage output buff was great but the main issue with his attack is it inherits the worse traits of good attacks. 
---
It lacks:
---
The high damage output for most close encounters (unlike shelly and bull)
---
the thin spread of multi projectile attacks (unlike colt and rico)
---
fast unload speed of the attack (unlike colt, bull and a lot of others)
---
the reload speed is also mediocre
---
Also another issue with bow is ever sinse the landscape update an issue under the radar with Bo is it's way to easy to spot him putting his mines down. 
---
Opponents usually know exactly where they are.
---
I suggest (don't have to respond to this part devs) that they either make opponents not see him place the mines or change the mines to drop 5 and initiate much faster but at the same time they are always visible and have no knock-back.
---
Also Bo remodel? 
---
I think that the star player should recive something, like 5/10 gold
---
Will Nita get a black bear skin?
---
What happen is you get a legendary those the percent goes back to we‚Äôre it all started or does it just stays were you left off
---
F
---
They look like two alabama rednecks abot to commit incest
---
Hooooooooooo-oh bad meme
---
Yugioh?
---
Yes that is the reason that would be great to see just a mode like that. Since maps have their own best and worst brawlers, with a map that does not conteins walls but only grass would be fun to try.
---
And btw, i can relate with the Pam thing, that deserves to be tittled as a beast.
---
When you shrink and resize an image is MS paint.
---
Captivating!
---
Because of because of because
---
yeah, no quality control from what I‚Äôve seen
---
Ok wouldn't expect any until after the inevitable remodel 
---
Hey guys! I wanted to ask you 2 questions.  
---
Right now when you have a brawler at 500 trophies, it's at max rank and there is no point to push more, besides leaderboard. Some of us don't play these brawlers to don't lose trophies. 
---
1 - Will you make a "casual" mode where you can play the game without losing trophies? Sometimes you don't want to concentrate too much, just chill and play with friends that are at lower trophies.
---
2 - Do you think the leaderboard system counting the total trophies is good enough? Do you plan to do different leagues system, more than push trophies?
---
For the moment, In order to push the leaderboard is a must have all brawlers at 500. But you need to do it with all available, and in the future there will be more. It looks like a system that aknowledge more the hours spent than a ratio between victories and defeats.
---
Thanks for hear us and keep the good work! 
---
Yeah I‚Äôm gonna go on a limb and say it‚Äôs not Brock. I‚Äôm pretty sure the consensus is Bull, but I‚Äôm gonna say hopefully it‚Äôs someone not in game yet. 
---
Will you implement 2D as a graphics option in the game? PD: I asked this question but I lost the thread and I do not know if they answered UwU
---
WHEN WILL YOU VOICE LEON PLEASE
---
If you use you have smol pp
---
No because the game values F2P and is not fortnite
---
How much did Supercell pay you?
---
just get one powerup lmao
---
Then you have already seen it before.
---
Brawl stars....BS.... it all makes sense now
---
Aw this is so cute, maybe thats why she absolutely bombs him in a 1v1
---
Shouldnt crow have a deep-ish voice?
---
The issue here is that people think it's so simple for a company like Supercell to hire someone... Based on just a few concepts. 
---
To be fair though, this sub is filled with kids. 
---
The special title is the main reason I bought three of them. And now, they are gone. It‚Äôs disappointing.
---
It‚Äôs extremely hard because of the shadows to see but it is purple.
---
What?
---
BULL
---
I got 41
---
How is this a new skin idea...
---
GEDI-KOR's Chicken crow.. i'm so in love with this concept.. it fits the game sooo well. He would throw rotten eggs hahah

Wtf crow looks good we need to buff him supercell is fucking stupid

Will tanks get balanced as tanks should be now that spring pads are a thing? High health, slow speed? And also, why as a Leon/Crow in the 200+ character trophies range am I constantly being put between 2 tanks in solo showdown?

Are you going to add gedi_ukor‚Äôs skins to brawl stars in the future?

Idk

Hilarious too..,they made a shitload of money on him then nerfed into normality soon after.

i see it
---
Amazing-ly annoying and bs with all the rushers.

Who thinks Leon needs a buff after like a hundred nerfs, I have him at power 10 and rank 20 but he is still weak compared to the other brawlers.
---
Did he call you a reposter or something?

Yea true, but u could use it in gem grab to get a win for ur team. Just shoot towards your team‚Äôs spawn point

---
Will you add daily rewards
---
Not at all, the thing that makes crow usable is his small hitbox and quick movement speed which makes it easy to dodge certain attacks, because of the spread of pam‚Äôs attack it is nearly impossible to dodge meaning pam will almost always beat crow due to her huge hp advantage and her damage advantage if she hits at least 2 projectiles at long range. Her healing turret can also block crow‚Äôs daggers while healing her to combat the poison damage. Even with the power up advantage crow will rarely beat a pam.
---
Or maybe new rare brawlers? ( Õ°¬∞ o Õ°¬∞)
---
That one map in bounty with the 2x1 walls all over is gonna be his easyyyyy

Hey Dev team, I don‚Äôt know if this has been asked about already but I have seen some concept art about have a challenges like what supercell has added to clash. Have you guys been thinking about that idea?

It was a joke. I though OP was goofing around did you not read my reply to them?

---
Will there be another clash of clans/clash royal easter egg in BRAWL STARS.
---
Any plans for brawl stars Indian community?
---
I don't understand what point you're trying to make.
---
I REALLY like the concept, although the main attack feels too similar to Piper‚Äôs. Also, if the projectile takes 1.5 seconds to charge to max power and it travels nine tiles total, it sounds like a pretty slow projectile. The super duration feels a bit short as well.
---
I think this brawler would be really awesome and very unique if the following changes were made to it:
---
-Make arrow pierce targets
---
-Make arrow deal more damage each time it pierces a target
---
-Increase super duration to 6 or 7 seconds, or make it to where the target travels a little slower for the 4 seconds
---
This brawler has great potential. I think the star power is awesome too, by the way. Have any criticisms for my ideas? Please share!
---
Or is he guaranteed super rare?
---
I dont think u understand my comment
---
Am i the only one who wants Supercell to change Crow¬¥s voice? The current one sounds A LOOOOOT different from his voice in the "No time to explain" animation, it should not be like that, theyre supposed to be the same character
---
I know I‚Äôm probably wayyyyy too late but are you ever going to add a ‚Äúsolo bounty‚Äù similar to showdown but you despair and it‚Äôs FFA and you get trophies and tokens based off kills? I think this would be a sick game mode!
---
check out r/mortisgang 
---
Q1: Is there any chance that you guys will implement a club war feature like clash royal my club mates are gitting bored with the same old same old
---
Q2:  The promotion to senior and vice president isn't really meaningful since you don't get any thing from it are there gonna be anything to do with the ranks later on?

Cool drawing but I cant see it
---
Really buff crow
---
Yup, they removed the one and only useful thing about bo :'(
---
ok ...
---
A few. 
---
1. Do you guys have your own game engine, or look? All supercell games seem to have the same vertical angle and character styles (which is amazing by the way!)
---
2. What do you use behind the scenes for the real time gameplay. I read that nosql is used for the player data, but how do you guys handle the real time parts of games?
---
Thanks, I'm a huge fan of your work!
---
The truth is this happen to any maps when u unlocked a new brawler , not becuz of dune drift
---
It's actually to little boxes
---
?
---
Imagine how many powerups you can get in this map
---
That's kinda true, but if you have a brawler that has decent damage, you can kill shelly.
---
CAN U BUFF CROW AND ALSO I HAVENT GOT A BRAWLER LIKE IN 4 WEEKS ü§îüòëüò≠
---
Solo and duo are hard for me
---
One of my favorite good job as allways
---
sigh... can u read my argument before writing down yours? I have to keep repeating stuff because people are too lazy to read my argument. teaming is NOT an exploit or a cheat. Its allowed by supercell.
---
Teaming is a strategy, and admittedly a low skill  one. But, just because i have a low skill strategy doesnt always mean its a low skill **cap** strategy. Are u saying that i dont gain skill nor experience by teaming? No. Just playing the game by itself, no matter what strategy i use, it still gives me skill and experience. Therefore, the premise that teamers have low skill is obviously false.
---
When u say u have bad randoms all the time, isnt that just being selfish? What if you were the one who made a mistake that cost the game? What if the "bad random" says "I got bad randoms that match" (referring to you). Gem grab, heist etc are a team effort. If u place all the blame on your teamates, that is just being selfish and bias, since u have an inclination to blame them as u have seen many other people blame them as well. 
---
The link from premise 4 to 5 is also vague and unjustified.

Thats a good idea, but i think it would get annoying to have to point your attack somewhere just to see ahead. Also would you not be able tonsee if you dont have ammo?

How many  skins will appear in the next update

Thank you! I'm surprised such a brilliant group of designers would casually drop a statistical fallacy like that.
---
Please see my suggestion in my reply to Ryan. I didn't want to flood the thread with a repeat of what I just wrote. Would really be cool if your team can give feedback on that idea.

Probably in the game more qualities of brawlers are introduced?

Have you seen some of those bounty games where there is literally 0 . kills for the entire game? This seems like a ridiculously long match, especially as you get more trophies. Plus, it's too similar to Bounty.
---
This is just sad
---
40 was not an example for Brawl Stars but was the example for Hearthstone where unlocks work differently, no one actually believes it should be 40
---
Which brawlers will get a skin rework in the next update? Also, I really want a separate skin for Leon!

He's good all the way to 500 on passage.

Y is getting a brawler is very hard to get as a free2play player? 1 Personal question i hv 14 lvl 20 brawlers out of 16 and i hv been playing when it is released to global  and but i hvnot got any new brawlers since i hv like 3.5k trophies..so is there any new chnge to getting a brawler in the near future update? 
---
It was sarcasm. More bones doesn‚Äôt mean more upvotes
---
Will crow ever get a buff/rework, compared to other legendaries, and brawlers in general, he is very weak, in every game mode

Don't worry he's offline and we all know how dumb bots are, so he is excused

grind those boxes, hope your lucky lol

It's annpying bu there is nothing they can do about it
---
Actually, my experience was different. 
---
I'm maxed account and as soon as Gene release I bought him with the offer and it took me exactly 113 boxes to get him to lvl 9 (without SP). I don't open boxes for SP as it will show up in the store in the next few days after my brawler is lvl 9, so for me it's not worth it.
---
Some high trophies player play like a noob,I think trophies are kinda useless.Maybe you guys should find another way to match-up player
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Add Face animation to all brawlers and add emotes!
---
Beware the idea of march
---
This is how showdown should work.
---
You get 1 point for every elimination
---
You also get points for survival 
---
Last is 5 points ( 3 in duos)
---
Second last is 2 points ( 1 in duos)
---
Third to last 1 point (0 in duos)
---
Everyone else gets 0 points for survival
---
The player with the most points after a match ends gets their ranking. If A match ends early for you your trophies won‚Äôt received your trophies until after the match ends, this will also encourage people to spectate the matches after their death. 
---
This way someone who gets 5 kills and ends up in 5th place still has a chance to get 2nd place if the last survivor doesn‚Äôt kill many people.
---
Here‚Äôs an example
---
1st place - Killed 2 brawlers, last survivor = 7point
---
2nd place - killed 5 brawlers, 5th to last = 5points
---
3rd place - killed 2 brawler, 2nd to last = 4 points
---
4th place - no kills killed by 3rd place 
---
5th place - no kills, killed by 1st place
---
6th place - no kills killed by 2nd place 
---
 
---
7th place - no kills killed by 2nd place 
---
8th place - no kills killed by 2nd place 
---
9th place - no kills killed by 2nd place 
---
10th place- no kills, first to die killed by 2nd place 
---
This system is good because it doesn‚Äôt completely eliminate camping, staying alive and getting 2nd or maybe even 1st place will still get you into at least 3rd place most of the time. In the current system the only way for a camper to lose is if they die, but in this system just getting to 2nd place isn‚Äôt enough if some random leon got 5 kills. Because of their high score from the kills they will take 2nd or 3rd place from you, so you can‚Äôt leave anyone alone anymore, every player is precious meat that can‚Äôt be surrendered to other lions. 
---
Then, are hot dogs considered a sandwich?
---
What is the objective of making the Leon unplayable?
---
This would be hard to make, and Supercell doesn't want to ban people for teaming, so I don't think they will lower their drop rates either
---
His super is going to buy some milk for 17 years
---

can you give us a sneak peek  on Bo's re-model?
---
100%
---
I thought it was time to move to the boom box crew
---
It's the same person, isn't it? Take your meds, man. Oh, and remember your post, "Supercell goes to the funeral?" I remember that. 
---
Thank you for making this AMA! I have a few questions to ask and I hope I'll get answers :)
---
1- Will all brawlers have voices in the future? And why did the newest brawler (Gene) get a voice first while some old brawlers didn't have voices (I love his voice actually)?
---
2- What do you think about people creating subreddits for each brawler and fighting? (like r/mortisgang vs r/dynamikegang)
---
3- Will Night Witch Mortis skin get remodelled? I see people didn't like it so much.
---
4- can you tell one word about the upcoming update?
---
Love you and Brawl Stars :)
---
This is so true, I played random Siege, lost then wanted to get my trophies back looked back up I was -50 and one like 2 bounties then got off.
---
repost fuck outta here

Your post has been removed, make sure to use the body of a post to elaborate on the title.

Difficulty is not the issue. Ranking up feels grindy and it feels disproportionately bad to lose when one bad start can instantly undo an epic victory. You are really just making my point for me, by pointing out it gets worse the further you progress. If there was a proper Elo system for those at Rank 20 the grind to get there would be worth something. See, I don't like the style of play required to consistently win. You need to either team up or hide until a few people have died. I don't want to play like that. I want to charge into the middle of Feast and Famine solo, not lose a fight for a box and spend a minute and a half hiding on the edge of the poison. 
---
Miss me with the whole 'get gud' nonsense too.
---
In the practice mode will there be a sort of button which you can change the power of the brawlers instead of keeping it max?Are there new things that are going to be added in the practice mode?
---
Lol nope, just a random idea I thought of ^_^ 
---
DAMN, YOU'RE SO GOOD
---
Just keep playing and collect every star token and collect all your tokens eventually you will get new brawlers
---
Wait, when did I say it was the truth...?
---
Thnks..btw how did you get the mortis sigh after yur name
---
That's the worst mistake beginners make with Mortis. Never use him as gem carrier unless its lass resort. That makes you team 2v3 and u can't win that. Mortis should be used as aggro. He's really high skill cap,
---
Doing the sme
---
Go to the top of the brawlstars Reddit page click the 3 dots on the right then click choose flair
---
When will we see an updated fankit?
---
Talk about dumb
---
Ayyyy
---
Holy shit that looks amazing
---
The file-size limitations  problem can be solved simply by asking the user's consent to download other additional data, if the answer is positive the game will be "complete" otherwise a basic version can not be loaded, not including many "stage" effects
---
Idk..except for new brawler which very few player face(they dont get it in months and  they have more than 500 triphy for every brawler) the game is quite good..i reached 6-7K in a month after first seeing the game..I think overall games fast too..but ofc they dont want you to get all brawler in a month right..one or two years uk
---
Siema
---
&gt;!in the rules it doesnt say no swearing so this is it chief!&lt;
---
Its your opinion right? Cause its not the update at all
---
First, I dont play Fortnite ( cause my PC sucks), Second, I am Much older than that, dont assume someones age -_-, Third, I hate Shelly, and I've got many other Brawlers! Stop insulting people little kid!
---
r/madlads
---
But that will also affect teaming
---
Do you guys have any plans to fix the full screen issue on the iPhone XS Max? 
---
The worst, in Skill Level! And then why do you defend her?
---
Ya feel same too.but your progress in a month is impressive.i only play the game until i run out of tokens.whats your strat?
---
I've had some bad ones but this was crazy
---
F 
---
You‚Äôre litterally reversing what they did
---
Just go to the brawler stars page on Reddit and click the button on the top right corner, there select user flair and you can choose your favorite brawler.
---
I hear pros saying, her Super need a slower reload, and than Crow is the Weakest right now!
---
Idc cared about the tokens till recently..i just till i liked..But now..as i have 8100 trophies and 16 brawler..there is very less scope for playing..hence i just play to collect tokens
---
It‚Äôs significantly harder to win a 2v1 than it is to beat a mortis with Dynamike. But teaming wouldn‚Äôt be a big problem if it was just 2 people. No every match i go into in showdown has 6 people teaming in the middle.
---
You clearly don‚Äôt have more than 1 option if you want to play showdown. As you listed you can die (complete opposite of the goal) hide in a bush (you‚Äôll delay your death by 10 seconds because the group of six people will find you quickly) or don‚Äôt play showdown (so you can‚Äôt play the solo gamemode). 
---
‚ÄúU say that showdown is a good aspect of the game, but u ask me to play 3v3. Why would i want to not play a good aspect of the game? are u trying to prevent teamers from teaming by asking them to play something else for your own benefit? ‚Äú I don‚Äôt know how you deducted that you shouldn‚Äôt play showdown. The thing that makes showdown so enjoyable for 88% of players is the fact that it‚Äôs a free-for all. But you never intended to play it like a free-for all. So stop trying to act like I‚Äôm making you suffer for my own benefit
---
Yes solo is just a description, you don‚Äôt have to follow it. You also don‚Äôt have to help your team in gem grab, get kills in bounty, or score the ball into the opponents goal in brawl ball. It‚Äôs just a description, but guess what If you don‚Äôt even try to do those things, you are being toxic.
---
If you want to play as a team play a 3v3 game mode. If you want to play solo, play solo showdown.
---
But here‚Äôs where the real kicker comes into play, you don‚Äôt want to play 3v3, because then that would be a fair match. You‚Äôd rather play 3v1, making it much easier to push trophies.
---
If you‚Äôre gonna play as a team, do it in a team-based mode. If you plan to play solo, do it in a solo-based mode.
---
That would make sense actually
---
Yea I'm gonna say no.
---
I had a quick questions Supercell my chances are very high to get a Legendary/Mythical brawler and I‚Äôm concerned when will I get it üíî 
---
Jesus can this guy be any more predictable 
---
Bo and Tara redesign finally
---
You just need to look up his Profile, and then his Comments! And he hasnt even Posted something himself!
---
See you in hot
---
Finally something to do with Tara 
---
It clearly says datamined my guy....
---
You forgot to add ‚ÄúGIF of Primo jumping into the enemy spawn with 10 gems‚Äù
---
(Great idea though)
---
Yeah its not coming back
---
*Press X to doubt*
---
lol
---
What mode do you prefer to get faster trophies ?
---
Once all the brawlers have been maxed out, there seems to be no use for coins. Is it possible to use coins to earn other rewards within the game? 
---
I.e. You can purchase different brawler skins with coins. 
---
Perhaps there can be an option to purchasing new skins with either gems or coins. Since skins do not effect the gameplay, I think this would give a new motive for maxed out players to continue to play. 
---
there is no best comp in **solo showdown** because every map is fair to all brawlers, and supercell is making that happen as well. For dynamike teamers in skull creek/hot maze, they have already evolved since they are teaming with their own kind, which is naturally good in that map. Since they have evolved, they **cant evolve anymore** (unless u have ideas) (there is only two stages of evolution 1st is teaming with everybody and 2nd is  teaming with ppl so that the team has a team comp ), so eventually strats to counter teamers will evolve faster than strats for teaming since teaming strats are stuck at stage 2
---
Congrats to Cake day
---
Is this real?!
---
can you increase the epic brawler rarity?  or all of them because i can't seem to get any brawler after i pulled my Leon
---
When will you debuff frank?slow down a little bit of ghis stun
---
Supercell!  This is how you do it! Awesome work as always OP!
---
I hope so, because seriously, they're FINALLY REMOVING Cavern Churn from the map rotations!
---
AND making the game broken and WAY less f2p friendly.
---
400 trophies it was lmao, just some losers who were to good for the noobs, but cant play anything else, and now Struggle!üòÇ
---
U make better skins then supercell
---
First of all I want to thank all of the guys working hard for this game.here are my questions:
---
1.the game is much lagging.will it be fixed?
---
2.will gem drop increase?
---
3.planning on any new gamemode?
---
4.planning on new feature?
---
and? are u giving pancakes ? sad
---
Box*
---
Guys,i want to ask will there be some clan activities like the clan war in clash royale? P.s. thanks in advance. Another P.s. sorry for my punctuation.
---
What‚Äôs the logic behind brawler offers appearing in the shop?
---
I have maxed 21/23 brawlers by power points and have been waiting for Leon or Gene offer for 3 weeks already. 
---
At the same time I see people getting legendary or gene offers today, on March 8th. It‚Äôs obviously some kind of segmentation where I‚Äôm being steered into buying mega boxes to get new brawlers. I did that a couple of times and got abysmal value out of it - useless coins and event tickets.
---
I think it‚Äôs kind of unfair. I‚Äôm ready to pay and buy new brawler - please let me do it.
---
That maze is making me feel like looking at a bunch of led pixels...
---
Make his knife things into red, blue and green froot loops he should have a froot loops skin
---
Or a one way mirror that can be placed on walls
---
kudos to jessie for being power 1 at 340 trophies
---
so what am i supposed to look for?
---
And then theres mine its a robot and it has no batteries!
---
I got Tara 
---
One thing that stand out(for me) is the brawl replays are available at any trophy
---
Nope.
---
Have you seen my second post
---
After Carl releases
---
Will there be a st Patrick's  skin ? 
---
I know she is, but imagine playing Gemgrab as power 4 vs power 8 pam. Its tough to carry and you will need to rely on your team to deal with pams healing station(cuz you wont be able to break it with your cogs that easily) and if your team can't reliably do that you probably lose.
---
Whatever happens, Shelly is the showdown queen
---
yeah i have 
---
Same here. You might want to wait until new brawlers unlock.
---
No thanks

Second. Btw is samir a nepalese name?ü§î

Thank You!!
---
What does c 8 mean? O.o
---
Will we get to see more than 3 or 4 skin slots and can we actually see some badass skins like for leon a assassin creed outfit or for colt a ww1 skin
---
Hello please make skin on Pam . Ghostbusters Pam
---
Legendary VS Trophy Road
---
Do you think we can link a short story clip as background story for every brawler? 
---
O_o
---
No offense but this looks really fake
---
Oww... I thought level did matter too...
---
Will you make the game more free2play friendly? And does the rule of brawl boxes even work? (If you have collected all the brawlers of the same rarity, the percentage will be split equally to all others)
---
I got tara's powerpoints
---
Are we ever gonna see showdown without modifiers?

No

H ey Supercell I have write 3 times to you becouse I don't found my message how can I found it ?
---
If I can't found it this is the question;
---
I have an account with 3100 cups and 14 brawlers, why my friends have 2500 cups and more brawlers than me ?
---
(We haven't put money in the game) 
---
Sorry for bad english.
---
Thanks.
---
I had Piper. I already had her upgradable, and now I have even more. The only thing I‚Äôm short on is coins...
---
Ehh, the languages like Spanish are more or less readable. I'm thinking things like Japanese or Korean, that's where it gets tough to communicate. Lucky I understand Chinese though lol
---
1 tile gaps...
---
I hear you guys out. Probably going to have to back to drawing board on this one someday (literally). Thanks for all the feedback, it really helps :P
---
I got them for spike
---
I havent seen leon power poits ever since i leveled it to 8
---
I clearly played way too much Clash Royale
---
Get this post to the top!
---
üòò
---
It's not a bad idea but the problem is how low the value a single box is
---
*You're
---
Guys don't hate on it. It's nice to have some hope for stuff. Piper remodel FTW! It seems weird that everything the community wants is here, like the removal of Cavern Churn and the double star token for Siege, but it seems good.
---
main spike is male. shakura spike is female.
---
Oh, and take my upvote too.
---
Even worst is when you are 7500+ trophies and get players like that in your team
---
I got them for Piper
---
you forgot to add the questions on control customisation
---
Lol happy cake day.
---
Where did the idea of carl come from?
---
Are the teamers going to get ban soon? 
---
Does your Luck increase when you open any box or do you have to open a whole bunch at once coz Ive been opening boxes as I get them for some months now and my luck hasn't gone up. It only goes up when I save like 10 or 20 and open them all at once.
---
tara was my lowest. you are on to something. 
---
But why is he requesting an F ?
---
Tf spike is a girl?!
---
Neeko!
---
Mine were for Tara. It may be situational depending on who you have that would benefit from that amount of points, as I was a similar number of points away from upgrading Tara.
---
It‚Äôs not
---
Yeah i also got that
---
So? People can't fake stuff?
---
Have you thought about adding a extra attack opption? You can use super attack and normal attack but what about adding a extra one? I think it would have made this game more skillbased which is good!
---
This is... fake, too good to be true.
---
Lovely game! Will you in any further time reward the beta players? Atleast with an icon or something
---
i dont like clash royale, but damn, this is a good skin.
---
Yeah... they‚Äôre annoying af
---
A report button will be implemented for people that team in showdown
---
Batboyo happy cake day buddy üòä
---
That changes the whole idea of showdown so much you might as well make that a new game mode, one where the goal is to survive and one where the goal is to get kills.
---
That's honestly just teaming in a nutshell. It makes sense rationally speaking.
---
Hero 
---
Lol aint got the joke?
---
everyone got a brawler offer and 150 power points for a female brawler (i got tara). pretty nice!
---
The shadows and the next skin do not match
---
r/brawlmaps  
---
  
---
We really need some rules around this in this sub.
---
At the moment there is only one name change per account. People are hoping they will make name changes cost gems in the future though. 
---
Did supercell go mad or what? That is a LOT to cover...........UNLESS, they have been making this since Gene
---
Tara 150pp
---
Or this is fake
---
Happy womens day bro
---
Teming showdown update
---
Big fan here!
---
I'm wondering if you guys would consider a new rank system other than trophies for competitive. (And independent from trophies)
---
Something like a league system and a competitive mode that plays three game modes in a row with the same team of people against same opponents. With a ban pick phase before each of the three modes.
---
I feel like that "MMR" would be a comparably fairer than the current match making.
---
Not that I dislike the current one,, it came a long way. But improvements are still improvements ;)
---
:(
---
Does anyone have context? I assumed it just meant, "ours feels weak and thiers feels powerful". But I don't get the every damned time comment. Is there something else I'm missing?
---
Got Nita‚Äôs star power from the big box
---
I got 150 jessie points
---
I would like to know why it is so difficult lately to get a new fighter, it is a stupid question, but in my previous account I received them very often thanks
---
No it isn't it's about free stuff. Who cares about women anyway??
---
(Sarcasm, for the people who think I'm serious)
---
Will there be a nerf for jessie and nita in boss fight?
---
Don't think it's fine. It's such a negative experience. If I lose, I wouldn't hate it if I could look back at the replay and figure "It was my fault, I could have aimed better/ran away from the unfavorable matchup/etc". But teams in solo showdown don't make me feel that way. They kill me and I don't feel like I had a chance against them.
---
WEST VIRGINIAAAAAAA
---
Just because I chose not to hit the nearest brawler beside me means I'm teaming. If I am a Mortis and I go after a Dynamike, and a Shelly is also aiming at the Dynamike, am I considered teaming? In this case no because it does not make sense for the Mortis to go after the Shelly because he would lose.
---
Just like in this scenario, it does not make sense for the Frank to go after a 2 power Shelly when he can go after a 1 power Shelly. If he decides to land 1 shot on the 2 power Shelly, it gives the 1 power Shelly a chance to 2v1 the Frank.
---
Not all forms of 2v1 are teaming. In this video, it looks like a normal 2v1 and does not have any proof that they are teaming. No clear intentions such as spinning or hitting each other to charge up their supers were made to show that they are teaming. 
---
That went downhill quickly......
---
the shadows are 2 spaces away not 1
---
Will you add a report button in the future? Because there is alot of players teaming in solo showdown
---
I have 9 acc and i got 5 leg
---
Car
---
Just put the /s for sarcasm
---
da fuq i got pam's power points
---
Based on all the posts this seems most likely. Barely anyone is saying they got it for Shelly or Nita.
---
well you got gene that is a if i can say so medium range brawler and can pull the longrange brawlers into bushes
---
literally crows super...
---
Just m o r t i s
---
1,700 gems haha, are you having a laugh?
---
I have founded colt pam el primo and jessie in akinator
---
So that's good. I have none
---
So for somewhat newer players that had issue with the release, are there any good tip on getting more heroes other that completing the line.
---
Even if this is fake it‚Äôs all of the things we want!!
---
I think it changed with the update maybe because I‚Äôve also been seeing bigger gem stacks
---
Yeah but his idea was that you can still shoot and it‚Äôs kinda a dash through the wall to ambush a player and you go transparent for a bit after.
---
i photoshopped it, tought you'd figure that one out 
---
Yup I changed it too already, and because the colours changed in the last update, I don't like the color what I have right now. Sry my bad english :)
---
i am dumb üòë
---
Hey GEDI-KOR! 
---
* We would love to add fan made skins into the game at some point. Right now we're still trying to build up a small library of skins (and make sure that all Brawlers have at least one!) 
---
* We *may* change Bo's attack animation, but haven't gotten there yet. First step is redoing the model. 
---
it's pretty good photoshop so i don't blame you üòéüòéüòéüòé
---
Too good to be true
---
Yep! She was my first at 500 trophies as well! And agreed, I think the beauty in prediction is not only base on your reactions or speed, but it's kinda of a mental game with your opponent, right? Haha, you have to make them think that they are in control and then surprise then surprise them with an umbrella bullet where they least expect it! Haha. 
---
But cool to know that more people share the same passion for Piper as me, haha XD
---
I got Pam power points
---
It still promotes hiding when early deaths are punished so hard.
---
Make it

-3-3-2-2-2-1-1-0-0-5 (You should be rewarded for winning.
---
Thing is my gf had penny 150 points when her lowest brawler was jessie 
---
Oh trust me... I'm sure tboys love this day too...
---
Congratulations on joining our mighty #MortisGang. Enjoy your stay.
---
I've done that so many times with bull... Without his star power you can get around 29% damage done by yourself.
---
Actually mortis is creature of the night
---
I got poco points 150 , thought the game was brokenüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
My plan to conquer Nick jr. didn't work out so I'm going to stay up all night and color my dick with markers
---
Only at the very end. The best thing to do is to as quickly as possible kill off enemy long ranged brawlers, then deal as much damage to the robot as possible and bodyblocking a little bit until it gets into the turret range at which point you start throwing ults at it to push it back, slow it down and distract it and also suiciding into it if needed. 
---
Ofcourse everything isn't always ideal and the enemy might be competent and not let themselves get killed off so easily. But if everything goes perfect you can take a lvl 20 robot even without any damage to your turret.
---
I'm a first year
---
I got Tara power points
---
well yes, but actually no
---
If people don't subscribe your youtube channel, will Bo really not get a skin?
---
NO NO NO. NO. NO NO. NO. NO.
---
I m at 9.5k 20 brawlers and some of my frds even reaches 10k with 20 brawlers , keep grinding ..
---
Are good also dynamike and barley
---
True
---
Black ones are better tbh
---
this also shows how op shelley is...
---
But if i will get money i will buy it
---
and 100 useless coins inside
---
Frank is just like sparky of Brawl stars. Any future plans to make him better as a brawler?
---
Super Nice!
---
Can this guy do math? Because if he's talking about where he was then, yeah sure, but where he is now, No that trophy count is wrong
---
He basically wrote it's not coming in the next update 
---
His star power is amazing as well, don‚Äôt understand why a nerf would be needed... I think he‚Äôs one of the better brawlers in the game
---
I got tara 
---
So what‚Äôs ur point?
---
Thet was the place we "accidentally" stepped on T-series
---
Uhm yes
---
Siege best gamemode, high skill cap high rewards, got my first 3 brawlers to 500 thx to this gamemode
---
I got tara!!üòÇüòÇ Waay better
---
You're lucky... At the moment I'll be happy to unlock any brawler... It's been so long since I unlocked my last one...
---
Of Course
---
Meh....I would say it‚Äôs mid-tier compared to some of the other completely useless ones.
---
Dam I‚Äôm power 5 and it takes 6 so it hardly increases at all 
---
nevermind, got another 150 free powerpoints for tara 
---
now she's power 6
---
Dead meat
---
I don‚Äôt have any legendaries, with almost 4000 trophies. And Crow is easily one of the best support brawler, if he‚Äôs well used.
---
Removed - DO NOT SUBMIT POSTS WITH TITLES IN ALL CAPS. CAPS LOCK IS CRUISE CONTROL FOR COOL
---
nope, you need to reach power 9 and then with luck get the starpower out of a box or u buy it in store
---
Are there gonna be anymore Brawl Stars plush besides the 3 that already are there?
---
What is VO represent? 
---
Come home to the impossible flavour of your own super, come home to Simple Primo
---
I just had a doughnut, so yeah.
---
u/GEDI-KOR Keep up your good work! I think you‚Äôre beginning to influence the BrawlStars team!
---
Cool and balanced!!!
---
I think you should offer trophies for who used money in game... you can attract people to pay too
---
No.
---
Thought it was a Gedi post for sec good job
---
I got Tara's
---
I got Tara so it didn't have to be a photoshop
---
Actually Rico's super's bullets Pierce through enemies and bounce off walls
---
I don't understand why even after opening about 30 brawl boxes I didn't get even a single brawler . Can someone please tell me what's wrong..
---
I know Ryan. I know.
---
Awesome map,not like erratic stones or hot point,thay are thrash.
---
I got Tara's power points
---
I got power points for Pam... Which I rarely use...
---
My brother wants a Piper skin, can you make a skin for Piper?
---
Because supercell wants #money
---
Bro your work is amaizing.

Happy International ~~Women's~~ Dishwasher's Day /s
---
I'll bet anything that they won't do this for international Men's Day. 
---
I was kinda pissed because i bought that skin,  but then i saw it was photoshop
---
I'm interested in the gender balance of Brawlstars users. Do you have any statistics on this? 
---
Yo you were literally saying how crow is incredibly weak rn and how in his current state he doesn‚Äôt pose a threat to anyone, and ur getting hate? You just said crow needs a buff with different wording
---
This is the nicest way of a game celebrating women‚Äôs day.  Thanks supercell
---
You best
---
That skin is OP! Just wondering what does he shoot?
---
Laughed so hard...
---
Isnt mortis a boy?
---
Lmao this is fake af
---
Spin it to win it
---
How come there aren't skins for some brawlers like leon and tara?
---
Why would you tag him, I think it seems pretty obvious that that is fake 
---
When you have max brawlers, there‚Äôs no points to be had, so they put it for a box instead
---
Lowest lvl FEMALE brawler?
---
I would make his eyes red because you never sleep in Vegas
---
How?
---
End game is trash...
---
‚ÄúUh we didn‚Äôt expect anyone to get this far‚Äú
---
Maybe we are missunderstanding her gender
---
Can I eat him?
---
ty didn't saw
---
Her cards travel through enemies and boxes crows dont, she's very good on maps with choke points. 
---
NEXT UP:
---
Where did my dad go?
---
I had that same idea with the clones but couldn‚Äôt find a way to make it work without it being unfair, I really like what you did! Great work
---
It's been long to get a brawler i have opened tons of boxes why i can't get a brawler. 
---
Oh ok thanks for feedback
---
Me too
---
its random
---
I got a big box with only 34 power points for gene inside

Kewl

Very nice good job

Did You have any female mythics or epic

Hey Dani! I see you are a nice guy :)

I also asked a few questions in AMA, and they sadly only have 1 upvote (they are all in 1 message)... I really want to get answers, and I see the AMA is still open. Is there a chance for my questions being answered?
---
I played a game where both my teammates went for their safe and I was alone defending 
---
Oh well lucky me pam was my lowest one
---
Now I want to eat donuts
---
Yum!
---
This is so realistic it doesn't even look like fanart but a real thing
---
I‚Äôll try that 
---
Amazing,remember me the simpsons
---
I forgot it was free, let me go put it on.
---
i hope so... im not saying im top tier but im definatly way above average, it just feels very cheap at this level, alot of noobs but they're champions carry game types
---
Working tgt to kill other brawlers is not 100% teaming. If me and another brawler coincidentally corner another brawler and take him out together that is not teaming. It also does not make  sense for us to shoot each other just so that brawler who was cornered can get away from either one of us.
---
Why do I need to purposely fire 1 shot at brawler A and 1 shot at brawler B just to prove I'm not teaming, when I can use 2 shots to take out brawler A and hope that brawler B does not hit me back. Same goes for brawler B who is better off wasting 2 shots to shoot brawler A and not shoot me at all. That isn't teaming. That is just brawler B being in an unfortunate scenario of 2v1.
---
That should be in June for the LGBTQRSTUVWXYZ month
---
Lol auto aim Colt ftw
---
r/DoughNutFeel would approve
---
I‚Äôm sorry, I‚Äôm going to go fix that rn
---
More lines:Gonna Get some milk son, be right back
---
It's Time for your daily whooping
---
Can I have skin :) 
---
u/dani supercell 
---
u/frank supercell
---
u/ryan supercell
---
Throwers were wet their pants here 
---
Yes Any1 who saw Kairos's video would know this lol
---
I GOT PAM
---
&gt;8 hours ago  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;that‚Äôs a world record, i think
---
obviously
---
You get them!!!!
---
Good! 
---
Wait for spike or leon. Crow is the worst legendary 
---
Until he gets shotguned by a camping bull 17 years later
---
Yes!
---
Nice to new players but tough with the old ones cmon at least gems or a buff for crow LMAO
---
Shh
---
Global release was on November 14 and International men's day is on November 19.
---
I got 150 penny points, i dont play her she worth it?
---
Epic
---
Tara for me. 
---
No....
---
Probably scrapped map idea 
---
Yes of course
---
Guess I missed global release 
---
Hoya....
---
The only other time I‚Äôve gotten a free BIG BOI BOX was Christmas, didn‚Äôt get one for Halloween or Thanksgiving, but got one for national WOMANS day
---
Wtf supercell.
---
Oh u r swedish? üòénice
---
I'm not
---
Because masculinists do not exist. Luckily 
---
Hi! I have a question for the future updates! Are you going to updates the clubs? I mean, adding donations, club challenges, quests, 1v1 friendly club battle, or something Like that? Because now clubs are only for finding New in-game friends And chatting!
---
And i want to say thank you for all the Hard work that you guys are doing! 
---
I think you should get only 75 points for mortis...
---
What‚Äôs your favorite brawler?
---
Donut*
---
I got them for piper ;-;
---
the WTF things are everywhere   dude
---
I got Penny's... With her manly voice. 
---
I have some ideas to share ........
---
1) Club Wars (like Clash Royale) Clubs will compete with each other and the winning club will get like a mega box or something.
---
2) More Trophy rewards. Can Supercell add like Gems to the trophy Road or maybe other brawlers
---
3) Profile icon. Let us customise our own icons and maybe consider some skins to be an icon like Phoenix crow. Let us put a description of ourselves too for our profile.
---
4) Wins. U may put like how many wins we get for like brawl ball,heist,seige.....
---
5) Decrease the amount of trophies for replay because some people might not have enough and maybe there a funny things happening in the game
---
      I hope that u would consider some of these ideas
---
It‚Äôs free so it‚Äôs always worth it
---
beauty!
---
Shiek?
---
Do you mean much offense? Lol
---
I like it though because games are fast and more games = more trophies
---
&gt;you release Trash Skins yourself
---
That's rude. It was only 1 skin. And it will probably get a remodel soon.
---
I got Tara‚Äôs. 
---
Penny is my main and I‚Äôm kinda sad. 
---
327+150=...
---
I have 457 Pam points....
---
She‚Äôs level three.
---
To upgrade i mean, shes power level 3 and i have like 500 power points for her
---
This is fake because he just used inspect from his browser and changed the content in the website
---
And datamine doesn't look like that
---
Dont think that u can fool people easily
---
Me too and two days ago I bought 150 power points for Tara for 30 gems and then today I get the same amount for free
---
Yeah, it certainly is high now but each additional brawler released is pushing that bar up. But maybe at 5 and 6k are good additions for now.
---
Do we have anymore gamemodes we could be expecting this year? 
---
Good idea i like it
---
Gene: (pulls hard)
---
Brock: \*TRIGGERED\*
---
I had the exact same thing today. I leveled my Tara up twice with it. And I had the gene too. Cool.
---
NW Mortis
---
How to get crow and leon since 2018 i play this game i dont get them... üò¢ 
---
So i have a lil question and a request 
---
The request first: it's more associated with cr but u happens in brawl stars too and it's about super cell id,like i really hate when i miss click log in without supercell id so can u make it easier to log in my accounts directly,it said remember this account in this phone so i want it to remember it   -_-
---
Second :how many people do u have in ur team and r y satisfied with that number ?!
---
I got a free BIG BOX and thought this was done as some kind of a trashy joke...
---
But I saw a post that someone got power points for night witch mortis
---
than we well saw hentai things every where
---
I have nothing free in the shop..
---
What even carl
---
the box or night witch mortis?
---
Mention not it's nothing 
---
Hire u/phlorpe or u/gedi_kor, please!
---
Lol
---
Don‚Äôt project on me, Not my fault you like a shitty brawler
---
NSFW!!!!!!!!!
---
DONT REMOVED MY POST!!! 
---
Thabks for feedback! Spawn points are all on the outer spiral. Many things can be improved tho such as more boxes on spawn points that are at a disadvantage and less boxes on spawn points with most advantages. Kinda hard to see those exact ones right now until it is played tho.
---
Zeldas ninja alter ego.
---
It works by Total trophies of your team, they are pretty equal...
---
Danm that wouldve been neat
---
I like it, high risk high reward like feast or famine but the high reward isnt only for tanks. 
---
I just started using Bo, since i gotten him @ 3k trophies. Haven't used him since, currently 3650+ closing to 3.7k. I got Bo from 0 cups to close to 200 cups in this map. And i can say that i've fallen in love with Bo! Amazing map!
---
A rolling donut when he uses super! That would be hilarious
---
Do it for sure!!
---
Its just as fair as clash royale matchmaking its not level but rather trophie based.
---
TOO ACCURATE
---
Neither do I :(
---
Same here
---
That‚Äôs to much gems but like around 150 gems
---
Promotes night witch mortis so it‚Äôs bad
---
Getting a free Big Box in my store. I‚Äôm probably overthinking it but given the slang associated with box...well
---
All I want to see is a giant stuffed Nita bear
---
It was actually Free 
---
Ok, thank you :)
---
Poor Darryl
---
You will only have throwers like Dynamike
---
So you are saying,that tara is the worst brawler,i got it right?
---
Logged in just to upvote. Incredible idea, we definitely need this! The aesthetic effects (auras etc) sound so fun and I‚Äôd definitely feel motivated to keep playing ‚Äòmaxed‚Äô Brawlers.
---
Why i my drawing luck is so bad. When i have opened more than 40 box and i still dont have any brawlers (i have 3 rare and 2 super rare )
---
However, my friends start to play as same as mine and one have 2 legendary , one have 3 mythics and epic and all super rare
---
And 1 things that they also complete all super rare and rare brawler
---
They and me just play when we call to each others to play
---
I don't see any fair in lucky drawing as you say for the beginners
---
And the second thing i want to say that the random pick players like shit
---
They just pick me the noob and it degree me much cups
---
I am very serious about this. I think Leon was nerfed the wrong way. Him being visible to enemies in 4 tiles radius while using his super just ruins him overall in my opinion. It just removes the fun of playing him and he really is not invisible.
---
(I also think that he should be able to 2 shot kill shell or you should bring back the 10 second super.)
---
My question is whether if supercell will be bringing back the no sight range on Leon super? 
---
They should do this when they remodel her
---
I got Jessie 
---
Mortis aylavyu bana ver mortisi
---
Nah m8
---
WHAM BAM THERE GOES PAM
---
Thanks for feedback! Bushes in the inner side of spiral are broken off by launch pads, so when players hiding in bushes crosses the launch pads they will be exposed for a bit and reveal where they are hiding. 
---
Small obstacles like a barrel can be put on the outer bushes as well to break up the bushes and expose hiding players when they run around the barrel to the other side of the bush.
---
Just 1 super from Colt across the map will break up many connecting bushes as well.
---
*trohpies*
---
Looks alot better than night witch mortis 
---
She is to me, that‚Äôs my opinion. 
---
Yeah I know I reposted it again coz I put backstab in the title, I am playing since beta, IK what backstabbing means XD
---
Can you please add a kill count and how many kills a player gets the player will recive gems or coins
---
Wasn't it obvious? (fourth time) (second time)
---
This is the best TNT/jump pannel map i‚Äôve seen in a long time, good job, I do not think it Will be adder though, anyway, you got my bite ;)
---
Np...I was also addicted :D
---
Jessie‚Äôs is amazing. It bounces off the turret when you shoot at it.
---
I like to see  a nee tropee road witch new brawlers and emotes in the lobby plz dont steal Fortnite emotes
---
Checkout iron hide games. Always loved their stuff, worth the payment too 
---
This blends in so well!
---
Yeah
---
Global was 12th December. It was announced on November 14th on a youTube stream.
---
There will be no matches or play with union members like clash of clans
---
This was actually very good. I got 150 for Pam.
---
*****HAVARD WANTS TO KNOW YOUR LOCATION*****
---
I got piper 
---
Looks like someone tired of hearing about lumbago
---
Are you thinking about adding more features to friendly battles such as removing bots or promoting people?
---
he has the high ground 
---
That RR time tho
---
I hate seeing people hate crow,he is my main
---
I clutched the game w/ pam
---
They know she needs to be lvl 9 lol, they said that her power is shit so he isint exactly hyped about it but once they can get it they wont complain if they get it because its free. 
---
*_YES_*
---
You can't exit out of it, because it IS already openend when you click it. The rest are just animations.
---
She probably just wants to be on sugar rush and run from heavyweights that have ultra
---
Yo what the fuck so it's a mortis but he is a she now? Yo somebody gotta call 911 . I would have been happy with Shelly but sc gave me penny pp and penny is at the bottom of my trophy board
---
Life hates u
---
Is cool skin but doesn‚Äôt look like colt
---
Will there be club fights or whatever you call it in the future?
---
I‚Äôm not going to create opinions on the buff right now, gonna wait until I max him out to decide if he needs a buff or not.
---
One thing however: They need to change his super so that the daggers spawn ON him, not AROUND him, because honestly if you managed to land precisely on top of someone, the burst damage should happen.
---
Oof
---
What are your thoughts on achievements?
---
Looks great. Does he shoot coins?
---
They should make remodels or skins you made
---
Indian and nepali names are similar(it will be more accurate if i say hindu name) , samir is very common name in nepal and mishra surname is part of Brahmin's caste
---
LTMS?
---
Maybe call it outlaw colt?
---
All I gotta say with Brawl Stars is to make its UI less like Fortnite. THEN they'd be the best mobile company imo.
---
But if you can defend against that, that means that your next bot is gonna be like lvl 35
---
Why remove life leech
---
Are you working to implement the Battle Pass? And if so, will it arrive soon?
---
We gotta rich boi over here
---
I read that as veterinarian colt
---
This is the last bot I think
---
Yo what the fuck his star power
---
Women's Day is much more important than Valentine's Day lol
---
Your comment made me realize that the title was a pun
---
Chris Brown has entered the chat 
---
May be, Sheriff Colt would be good.
---
What problems do you have with T-series? It provides us with Bollywood song videos. What's wrong with that ?
---
Lol well then you're screwed 
---
Who was the maniac that voiced gene?
---
Yes please
---
Top best skins of all time.
---
2D art is not 3D modeling
---
_U should only make a communism Nita_
---
I still want random games because you can enter a match faster
---
Supercell should be confused
---
r/woooosh
---
We all saw this coming 
---
until you realize shelly's super has no range.
---
Oh no
---
‚ÄúNo‚Äù
---
I win with a random of 3000+ siege
---
Thank u
---
Yeah, still though.
---
Super far fetched to come up with the reasoning to form the past tense of laugh as oddly as you did, at least you got creative lol. 
---
Wish they let us choose who the points go to 
---
Np
---
Bo
---
i got 300 trophies from seige with randoms
---
Teaming stinks and it's sad that people actually need to win with this strategy I hope supercell fixes this
---
I mean it‚Äôs the only way bull can be good in showdown you either hide in a bush or u get rekt my mikes teaming
---
I‚Äôm talking about starpowers only. You‚Äôve proven my point with her bear though and the starpower being pretty useless. 
---
HeR SuPeR NeEDs A NeRf, btw nice play!
---
MCREE IN BS BB
---
Billy the Colt? 
---
W O W T H A T A S S
---
Would there ever be a new character added to the level rewards? Or is Bo just the last one?
---
Im not defending herü§®, im actually trying to make the point, that she is to Strong! Which isnt the same...and you dont know anything about memes! Basycally anything could be a meme, exept when its not ment to, what this Clearly is! Aiming wont help, if you dont shoot...
---
I got Nita
---
Please show us one more second of the clip  :DDD
---
I got Jessie
---
Yet you keep talking. The conversation was done yesterday.
---
You didn‚Äôt offend me. That would be ridiculous. Like I said, it‚Äôs just unnecessary.
---
Yes
---
that would kinda make it "everyones day" instead of women's day
---
Thats not 26k.
---
#KICK ANIME
---
Satan is that you?
---
But she can't get close to anyone, so everyone will just kill her while she can't attack.
---
Join the crow gang boi
---
My team: one player with 5000+ total trophies, me with 3000+ total trophies, and someone who has 10 total trophies
---
Friendly game.
---
It‚Äôs misspelled though...
---
THEN SHOOT U HAVE AMMO FOR CRYING OUT LOUD. And ur complimenting her when I'm trying to insult her. Dont tell some stupid lie by saying "I'm nOt dEfeNdInG hEr"
---
Haha right?
---
I think that supercell uses Shelly as a base player to tune other brawlers. I don‚Äôt remember them tweaking Shelly‚Äôs stats in a long time. I might be wrong tho
---
We could choose from the woman brawlers then ?
---
If a siege robot is in a bush. Is he invisible? If yes, i didn't know that. 
---
every solo match in passage is like this
---
I just wonder when/if the supercell team is going to acknowledge the skin design of their fans, because your skins are superior to literally any skin in the game.
---
The best games for mobile are the ones from Supercell
---
Magic archer bo!
---
I can actually try to make this
---
It‚Äôs a canary, miners used them to test for gases back in the day 
---
Will there be any events that involves us to work with our club? I would love to know what's in store for clubs.
---
Can he use high noon? 
---
Uhm...you and you Brother, are saying, that Shelly is WEAK! But she has the Strongest Damage Potential with her Super, almost like Barley before his Super rework, I am also talking facts and Numbers, that you cant Check bushes, that her Super Does to much damage, and Reloads to fast (what everyone in this Comment Section Agrees), and Comparing it to Leon! Xou were just as annoying to other people that said that Shelly is Op!
---
I hope she don't suffers from diabet 
---
Arena of bull
---
Did you see a lot of bo‚Äôs? I always seem to see a lot when I use him
---
Saltysquid

Gene won the fight, but they both kept their distance for quite awhile which is why I cut the clip short.
---
Reminds me zuma game :D
---
Hello I am dominicsans111 that is my username I know that you can not do this but my dad also plays the is called * Mmontiel87CR * and the always wanted a new character * a legendary * So if they can give you one? 
---
I‚Äôll get Tara on both because I already have gene and morti:)
---
Hey would you add an in game map editor and give players the option to play friendly games in community designed maps ? Im sure people will come up with some crazy consepets 
---
HELL YES
---
we need 49 gems mega box offer please help help help
---
I reckon Eir's blessing would be better, Hel is the goddess of death after all according to norse mythology. Eir, as the goddess of healing, would suit the role more.
---
Btw spare us from the names we can barely pronounce
---
8, Very Nice! üëçüèæ 
---
I thought that one last bo shot killed you 
---
You said that earlyer to, that you werent defending her! You are saying, that she is weak, when I am Saying, that she is much to Strong! 
---
I got 1000 trophies from S SD
---
Nice idea for a gem grab but bull n shell orirntated no walls would be nicer
---
Just delete solo showdown
---
ReAlLy?!?!?1?1?1?
---
Lmao facts
---
So this prevents teaming?
---
The mods of brawlstars competitive tried to merge the community so that more structured discussions go on there and more fun posts go here, but the brawlstars mods didn't want less traffic to go to this subreddit so they said no.
---
To the randoms you played with, aren‚Äôt you also a random ? ü§Ø 
---
dang, I guess it really do be like that sometimes
---
Been pushing amazing skins as of late great work
---
She needs a speed buff, she feels slow for her play style
---
Umm... looks like you can't take jokes.
---
 Are you thinking of increasing the chips? 200 to 300 
---
Will they put back the free chest as a daily reward? 
---
I think the walls are too long. 
---
Why almost every player has a brawler on their name how can i have one too?üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Where is the 'Humor' tag?
---
&gt;If we ban players who are near each other but don‚Äôt shoot for x amount of time, that can easily be overcome by just staying x tiles away from your teammates. 
---
Maybe you can detect players who are x tiles away from each other, and don't damage **each other**, rather than shooting or hitting anything else?
---
and I think you shouldn't ban those players, but maybe make the game a little harder for them.. 
---
Like if they stay near each other and don't hit each other for x amount of time, a robo or a huge asteroid will hit them for 50%-70% for their remaining health and clear all obstacles around them? - even on regular Showdown.
---
Banning shouldn't be the solution, after all as you said, the players are playing the game the way you designed it, they're just using it the wrong way. Solo Showdown should remain **solo**.
---
lmaooo

Leon does not have a hat its a hoodie
---
Thanks, bro!
---
Can you guys plz buff crow??üòÖ
---
 Sure, forcing him to kill ur teamate or die by other brawler
---
I can't be as consistent as Gedi is, he is on a roll. I got this idea and liked it, as silly it may be and I wanted to make it look as good as Gedi's work :)
---
in late survival I start to move and when I start to move I'm almost always dead
---
7k and none plus I‚Äôve opened enough boxes to have all powerpoints for all brawlers, I have all except legendaries
---
 Have a lot of people playing this mode, they liked it. I think in delete just in final case.
---
Yo! Lovin' the progress in Brawl Stars!! I'm wondering if new skins are coming up? Like in the next update??
---
I got pam points.
---
Have you tried... Moving?
---
Player‚Äôs names 
---
- what about dinamyke rework ! beacuse he is now very hard to play
---
- will we allowed to test any brawler in frindly battles in future ?
---
Also will we allowed to run a customized maps by pixelcrux in frindly battles ?!!

Maybe, it's a trap, who know ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø 
---
No I can play her
---
Why thank you! I did study the way his painting and coloring are
---
Thats fire
---
My power points are maxed on the women so they only gave me a big box. Smh they could‚Äôve given me 150 for spike or 2 big boxes
---
Lmao.
---
I hope you are joking too.
---
Yeah that's what I had in mind!
---
T H I C C
---
Spooky
---
Because it would be wasted ressources. Anyone who doesnt has a Skin yet, is either new or has a bad/old model. 
---
you are romanian
---
tbh honest i got this amazing win on cavern churn. i was tara and my teammate was rico. the last team was in the middle and me and rico were outside on the bottom left. i just threw my super into some random spot and the team was there and rico supered them. Man, if I had footage, it would've been great....
---
#0_0
---
Hahaha dunno. But look my profile I have a play with her 
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
And then Frank comes out of the bush taking all the gems and killing nita..
---
vodka vodka slav yes?
---
It can go either ways, don't give them ideas /s
---
Deseo que pongan bailes  y que regalen un baile 
---
well. it is a atack right?
---
Just look at his super, what do you think
---
They hated him because he told the the truth
---
Oh shit run
---
fake af
---
What is Supercell's face game? And which brawler in Brawl Stars is their fave? Eager to know :)
---
# They‚Äôre literally my gems rn
---
You forgot normal Barley
---
Nice skill ;)
---
that would be even more cursed than this piece of art
---
Well its cant get any worse then nightwitch mortis haha
---
It's just a meme. Don't take the fight seriously.
---
repost and fake
---
Please supercell, wed even accept these as skins.
---
&gt;Smartest thing I've heard from an Indian
---
Woah woah woah. I'm gonna stop you right there bud.
---
Star powers don‚Äôt count since they are added after rarities were, for example brock shares and AoE DoT with barley on his main but that is also a star power, and plenty of others like dynamites jump or Bo‚Äôs extra vision are super unique, but they are star powers which all share the same ‚Äúrarity‚Äù if you know what I mean 
---
I think rico would fit it better
---
First time?
---
Maybe spikes a chick 
---
Why did you need to black out the names
---
Dude... Emeralds as Gems... Command Blocks for spawning and rules... Create kits to represent "Brawlers"... Bows ans Crossbows as weapons... This would totally work!
---
Brb, gonna play some Minecraft lol.
---
You could also do Showdown, and with Command Blocks you could even make Bounty, Brawl Ball, and Heist!
---
##That Barley is a spah!
---
Ask supercell. Mythic wasn‚Äôt even a tier until they added tara, and mortis used to be an epic with bo and piper
---
r/inclusiveor
---
If you have a good idea for the turret!
---
Well.. I can't argue with that
---
Ugly
---
legit!!!
---
This is not funny.

In 3rd world countries maybe. Women are more privileged in 1st world countries than men. So I don't think women's day should be given much importance there.
---
A little after I unlocked Frank, I joined a random game with a Bull, we won like 30 games in a row. Frank is super fun in Brawl Ball!
---
Amazing!
---
What are the programming languages used in brawlstars?
---
Maybe some c++ c# of swift or objective-c
---
Spike girl confirmed! 
---
Well yeah, but I'm not big garbage
---
At 750 trophies...
---
Normally, it would be nice if the supercell did an event with double gems and double rewards, such as siege
---
That's hurts
---
So, who the hell is Bob and why you wanna kiss him (ew)
---
Yes. My account has all the brawlers that i have maxed excepting leon spike and gene that i havent unlocked yet
---
For me its bo vs piper vs pam lol
---
Can you PLEASE remodel Bo he looks like hes made of clay or smth and he lacks contrast. Also Tara skin pls UwU
---
well congraz man u achieved something that requires dedication 
---
Oh and add string to his bow
---
Sorry if I made any mistakes - I'm not a native English speaker. 
---
Disgusting
---
Japanese is third row, middle column. The setting for seeing the gems is one of the two bottom right buttons. Thanks for sharing this tip, OP! 
---
Really.
---
C√≥mo veo
---
You should be scared.
---
Yeah, I originally included that somewhere in the post but then removed it. Kinda regret that decision seeing how many people have been asking about it :/

If you can get together a good team and play one of the 3v3 modes that‚Äôs a good way. I got my Dynamike from 180 to 300 a couple days ago playing Heist with a couple friends. I‚Äôm not too sure if Siege kinda depends on how long you actually play similar to Heist. If you can get the enemy safe down in 1-2 Robo‚Äôs then you‚Äôll be set in terms of trophies to time spent gaining said trophies ratio. Grinding Solo Showdown works too if you can‚Äôt get in a good team of friends. Just be careful of the all powerful tilt. 
---
1: Do you plan on adding new modes? like for example a casual mode where you are able to play with random players but no trophy gain/loss just for fun. 
---
2: Do you think you're going to take any ideas from Reddit anytime soon? there are some good concept art and ideas on here.
---
Ok well then it doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs my opinion or not, just because star powers were added after rarity, it doesn‚Äôt change the fact that star powers are in the game and you can‚Äôt just ignore them
---
I tried everything out. Do i have to confirm it?
---
Matchmaking is partly region based so if you‚Äôre having a language barrier problem you‚Äôre either a minority or in a far away place
---
EVERYBODY GANGSTA UNTIL ANOTHER ROUND OF CREATURE OF THE NIGHT! 
---
What are you going to do when you make too many brawlers? wouldn't it be hard to balance everything (far in the future)
---
Fitting that normal Cacti always cause me so much trouble hitting shots with snipers that the Cactus who actually moves is a powerhouse. 
---
it's on a loop. they only disappear for 24 hours, then they are back for 24 hours. o.0 
---
No, his hand goes through walls when reaching out too
---
Is there an app or website for building maps?
---
confirm so ur game becomes japanese
---
Nah he is still overpowered mate
---
This is a mod
---
He was before his first nerf. After that I think he was fine, people just complain because his invisibility and it ending their Showdown before they can get in the top 4. 
---
That‚Äôs still an opinion that conflicts with supercells. 
---
Supercells opinion is this, and they‚Äôve said it in different wordings back when star powers were introduced. 
---
When examining the rarity of any given brawler star powers should not be taken into account
---
or... they could make a new brawler that instead of pulling them in, it'll be a tank brawler that pulls himself to a brawler o.0
---
When will Carl be in the game?
---
Yes, his hand would go through the wall, then if he doesn‚Äôt grab a brawler his hand grabs wall and pulls himself towards it
---
At least there will be a place were I can shout on people when they got 10 gems and still push (they die, we lose)
---
*Unintelligible laughing*
---
Ohh I get it, yeah that would be cool
---
Only for brawlers that are above 500 trophies, their trophies above 500 are removed. It isn't necessary to be at 3K for this, just that at 3K you'll also get some tokens when this trophy removal happens, every 2 weeks
---
nope. Once a single brawler reaches 500 trophies. at the end of the "Season" every 2 weeks you lose half the trophies over 500. so say you have a brawler at 550. after season ends, that brawler will be at 525.  
---
Season is unlocked at 3000 trophies which is why he said that. This is also why a lot of people get brawlers to lvl 500 as an achievement.

When is the crow buff coming?
---
Lol me too I didnt get any for like 4 months on my main acc and yesterday spike just popped up haha
---
What's funny
---
Kappa means to imply sarcasm. I thought this was.generally well known? Lol
---
Are you planning to put the game on PC,  like for fricks sake, it would skyrocket your playerbase, therefore your profit and would let you play if you have less than 4 internet lines at all times durring a match. I love your game, but if you don't do that it will fail, just like Clash of Clans and Clash Royale. 
---
LUMBAGO

far bottom right in settings

Didn't know one of the rules was to have a flair of your favourite brawler.

Bo I think needs a damage nerf and maybe a buff on super

I got my rank 6 poco to 500 with randoms. Just saying...

For low health brawlers you can literally do nothing when an invisible Leon comes out of nowhere

I actually like Darryl and Primo on this map though... they can super over/through the water and do quick damage to the safe.  as for brawl ball, any brawl ball map is good for frank so far at least lol

He‚Äôs still weak after the buff so it‚Äôs bound to happen

I don't sub to pewds nor tser

And I'm not planning on doing so either

lol got points to pam

Yea
---
You got a fifth of the population in your nation but
---
Ohh now I got it! Thanks but lol I don‚Äôt really think that‚Äôs correct 
---
Lol, no, Piper has the slowest recharge of the game, she is a sniper with a big shot, so it makes sense that she has a slow recharge like Brock. Heavyweights have fast charging, top speed, lots of life and a small range and big damage. The killers have the highest speed of all (= 820). It's ridiculous to compare Gene's recharge rate to Piper, knowing that he is not a sniper, so the classes of the brawlers represent their main ability. 
---
ohhh u are so lucky!!
---
Will there be some more info in brawler stats? Things like movement speed, reload speed, number of projectiles per shot, whole one shot damage should ve specified to players and would be useful! 
---
Do you feel lucky, punk?

I thought it was because his boomerang pickaxe "curls"

Hi brawl stars dev, do you know if you will be releasing another purchase bundle anytime soon? Or maybe more level bundles because I want to buy some gems and such however I just cant make myself buy them without a value offer!

Yes, I'm wrong.

---
Honestly though... Custodian mortis would be pretty cool hahaha
---
I like it in theory, that's what games like Overwatch do. But Brawl Stars is a mobile game with super short matches, if I want a quick game I'll play with randoms. If you want to discuss team comps and stuff, that's what friends and clans are for. If they had a setting to pick which queue you want, that would fracture the players and make it take twice as long to find a game.
---
i‚Äôd say automatic ban 10/15 min for people who spin 3 times in a row or something, but sometimes i just like to spin for fun when i‚Äôm in a bush or with my partner on duo, it‚Äôs funny cause we‚Äôre the only ones who know were spinning, idk just kind of a habit now. spinning is so important but not teaming lmao is this just me
---
Sorry man, dont sue us please

what if you get teamed on and get 10th place, that would suck. so why not just make it even with removing teaming?
---
The way Supercell Hided Names of Individual Brawlers all over 300+ trohies. They should Also Do that for all 3v3 Game modes. This will avoid 1) People knowing at the beginning who they are playing it and 2) prevent this ^^^^ and if you're actually playing against some Top pros/youtubers/friends. Also upvoted for visibility.

I swear supercell, if this were a skin, people like me would actually use Poco

Such noobs.

Supercell added leon with a Special Ability to actually crunch teamers. These ppl doing the opposite.
---
Best time as big brawler is over a day, wow the natural poison would defiantly not killed u by then wink wink

Finally someone who said it(and somehow you got 22 downvotes)
---
Are you planning on making better trophy road rewards? 
---
Do you plan on making a new currency?

You saw her and you still stood on opposite side of the chest... That was your own fault broseph, never approach a chest like that with a penny on the other side. Good luck.
---
I have 9300 trophy‚Äôs ............ weak ????? I‚Äôve been playing the game since bata and there was teaming then so If I didn‚Äôt know better I would think it‚Äôs just apart of the game
---
Supercell respects wamen*

Is he inspired by Tyr, the Norse God of War, because he too lost his arm to the wolf Fenris.
---
By the way, this looks amazing!
---
BILLY AIM FOR THE HEAD DANGIT
---
In what way did their response seem like they were triggered to you?
---
Honestly i dont think he will ever be buffed stats wise coz of his DOT damage and attack concept coz well preventing your enemies from healing for some time is good so maybe supercell think if they buffed him he might end up OP. I think if they changed the poison mechanic on attacks they could change his stats freely

While that would make sense and be a good basis for his design, he's just a normal draugr. Could make for a good skin though, if he got in.
---
I think that a Lancer (from Deltarune) skin for the Genie would be a pretty good fit
---
You can play duo showdowns.
---
you couldn‚Äôt escape it if you tried. 
---
Yeah ‚Äòtwas a joke. I read the text and thought it‚Äôd be perfect bait(and it worked).

But teaming is a high-risk high-reward strategy. I don't really see what's wrong with it.

Would have been much more satisfying and required more skill to get there without teaming. But hey congrats on your 9300 assisted trophies....
---
Where the map
---
Yeah. Try to avoid boxes honestly, instantly go in a bush and you wont be found(my strategy)
---
Oh, ok, that's pretty unique. Wouldn't Frank be able to destroy it? Or bull?

Nice you copied overwatch

Alright who wants to play? Ill glady join the game

Same feels bad

Oh ok

Well, we HAVE been asking for better free stuff in the shop. It's nice to know that Supercell doesn't ignore the community.

RIP Mortis
---
1.4/1.5 - 1 = 6.67% (rounds up to 7%)
---
DPS is calculated based on the amount of damage a brawler can do in a certain period of time. By allowing Crow to attack more times per minute, his total damage during that timespan has increased. 
---
Bruh someone hire this man
---
I hope they chucked their phones into their computer screens and they bounced back into their faces

how could you stop teaming?

Thanks :)

This would be perfect if only they didn't remove his bandana

This is actually pretty cool

I‚Äôm glad I could helpüëçüèº

They ended up stating in the QnA they needed a little longer to work on him and he‚Äôd be released later in the month
---
A showdown alternative: keep trophies as they are, but adjust the powering up in game. 
---
Like now, allow players to open boxes for more power. But...
---
...add more incentive for players to shoot each other. For every time a player discharges their super (after the first?) they get an extra reload. Or their reloading happens slightly more quickly. 
---
Players will shoot each other for a shot (pun intended) at an advantage later on. And if they shoot each other cooperatively, to charge supers more quickly? A non-teamer has a better chance of taking them out while they are injured. 
---
Yes please, nerf Pam!
---
Where did you get this?

Do you make videos of you making these?
