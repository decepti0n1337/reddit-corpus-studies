Why is this a remodel??

Why do people commit suicide just get a better life lmao
---
I‚Äôm 18 and I played since beta too
---
Started last Christmas and only need spike. Sadly I did also buy crow but only because of the skin and him being so many gems on there own. And the summer pack. It was a deal I couldn't pass.
---
"Gems"
---
Hahah funny get it because dynamike teams hahah
---
I too am proud
---
pocahontas. Also I can see your deleated posts famm.
---
I see your hunting for karma.
---
If ur luck is not garbage and u really want it then yes
---
oh hell nah
---
pocahontas
---

---
Silly me
---
Oh hell YEAH
---
LUCKY!!!!
---
Nah you just have to add gems on the trophy road and buff the amount of coins given. Simple as that.
---
These types of posts are the worst. They offer no conversation at all. No point to telling us this.
---
REEEEEEEEEPOOOOOOOOOST
---
its not his fault look since the rankings in the game is bs he was put with some rank 20
---
You should spend them on pocahontas
---
Wat

REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEPOST

This is not a bug, Poco's attack consists of four projectiles, just like Frank's. You ran into two of them.
---
Mine too!

Best idea :)

When i got my shelly to 500, i wanted to play more, but then shelly is now at 480... damn teamers and bush campers
---
Won‚Äôt happen for a while devs are on a holiday.
---
Wait for Tara‚Äôs new star power... hehehe [400 health every like 0.8 seconds]
---
Accurate.
---
Oh, I never team. That doesn't jive with me.

Impressive that you didnt die, i kept dying because tick keeps throwing bombs ahead of him making it impossible for me

You should buy that 500 gem deal and the rest of the gems to maximize your outcome. Then you get I think the 4x mega boxes for practically free

---
Love Paper Mario TTYD more than I care about its relation to Brawl Stars xD
---
You gave me a chuckle enjoy the upvote
---
But wouldn't it take time to actually play the brawler(bc there is always a day countdown)its attack/super animation,its stats,etc.
---
Where‚Äôs the mcsandwhich
---
Actually I take back what I said
---
I wanted to say this is great idea
---
RIP J√∂rgen
---
I do not understand why everyone wants Poco buffed. I have no trouble getting him to 700 casually. Do people not make teams for 3v3 anymore???
---
Good energy; bad idea. This would be terrible for long range brawlers and brawlers that can‚Äôt break walls
---
If you‚Äôre not good with poco you suck
---
I smell a rat....
---
I couldn‚Äôt believe how unlucky this was for the other team. Doesn‚Äôt mean I didn‚Äôt like it though.
---
what? No it‚Äôs terrible. I‚Äôm at 12k and paired with this guy in the screenshot
---
Is dis bo‚Äôs relative or something
---
I can get u one
---
#F
---
I would get spike, he can be good in every mode
---
Ohhh. I thought you were pushing the account shown. Yea I think though after time they will come to a balance but right now it‚Äôs broken
---
Yes..
---
Get spike he's overall better
---
*facepalm* XD
---
IM YELLING TIMBER!!!
---
True
---
Aye I said the same thing XD
---
Yea but crow is also really good
---
ARE YOUR TEAMMATES' NAMES JOJO'S REFRENCES?
---
So, what you SHOULD do is save your gems for tickets and doublers on sale, or the 60 tickets on weekends. That way you have a good chance of getting BOTH plus a whole lot of star powers and power points and gold. 
---
But we all know it's really annoying to leave it to luck, so I would just go for the cheapest one, which in this case has the better skin aswell (and a skin that you can't get from star points). If you HAVE to buy one, it should be Spike.
---
Ik, I'm just saying how miniscule the amount really affected the game.
---
I just use 1% to show how small it really is.
---
But glad to know u changed your mind because it's really not that big of a deal and supercells will keep adding to the game.
---
They may add more ranks, more/better trophy rewards,  and a larger trophy road that reaches to 25k perhaps.
---
Read the name carefully
---
Are you trying to deny that they need money? every game company trys to make it harder for f2p and much easier for p2w. If they make it too easy for f2p they won't be able to make enough money therefore the game has to shut down
---
Noooo
---
And I think randoms will never understand this mode and they'll just go to enemy base attack them with auto-aiming piper.üòÇ
---
what did it do? im not a veteran player
---
Stop reposting r/shittybrawlstars

What clan r u in
---
I could‚Äôve sworn they said in brawl talk if you win 50% you will land at 500 now after their update.
---
Some lie they fell for on a video that will make you ‚Äúgrant Leon‚Äù just by typing it
---
This is bad? All these rewards help a lot. I only have 3 star powers at 13k and these coin rewards are a huge help
---
He is going to get a remodel. It was said in the "brawlers that need polish" response and it will probably be next update.

#more like dead
---
Thanks
---
I know
---
When poco died a huge ring of healing comes out where he died but it only healed 1000 health per player and he had to die for it to be useful and at the time he wasn't in a good spot but he was a great gem carrier and as a gem carrier you don't want to die but you want to die to activate it BUT you don't want to die in general so it was quickly changed so his current one. Was weak but it was better then his old one. 200 healing per attack originally, now 500. this was a history lesson with agus AKA the user with the poco icon
---
why people team in duos thats dumb. shame on them
---
The perfect quality? Idk, I think my trophies are better quality, made from real gold.
---
Numb Digga, bruh
---
*gets supered in the face 20 times*
---
Lol he had to die
---
I don't have a legendary at 11k trophies experience 140
---
What is it? What did it do?
---
Everyone misses the old token season reward not the new star tokens that not all the players get.
---
.... u know what repost is?
---
He died
---
Yo

You forgot the 5 Rico teamers got solely obliterates by a Band-Aid Shelly

Ya, this is stolen, not a repost.

Bolt and shock? Looks more like bibi and shelly.

Nothing, that was my mistake

Me vs the guy she tells me not to worry about

I used the * then it happens this :/
---
How good are you though?
---
Also 400 is really very manageable now with the new trophy reward system. So 400 is fine imo
---
I got 6699
---
yeah, an emote/chat line button like in CRL would be great
---
I have to try that
---
I can hear some nerfs to Demolition
---
maybe have both a machine in the middle and one in each zone, but the middle does bigger payouts?
---
##Rico Abuse
---
"WHO ARE YOU?" isn't really a "Colt" thing to say.
---
Huh. never thought about that.
---
A mortis just tried that to me while I was pushing spike I didn't know how much damage he can do up close
---
did you know brad is actually canadian
---
Cheating/teaming defrauds the players there for Solo. Fraud, by definition, is misrepresentation for personal or financial gain. Lawsuit
---
Amazing
---
true but it's really annoying because only one other brawler is even close to 400 (penny) and all my funny moments happen with the others, a different one every time, and in the meantime I have no way to memorialise it
---
Lol yeah, but that‚Äôs how I drew ‚Äòem, so eh ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

True, but we aren‚Äôt doing it Kairos‚Äô way üòâ

it is literally just a popular meme

Tbh this would actually make a good skin and it would be a great reference to early Brawl Stars
---
Oof

Ya
---
You don't play showdown do you?
---
People who complains about cavern churn don't even know the showdown in my opinion
---
Even in your post you missed many brawlers
---
Rosa, bibi, leon, mortis, primo, and tick (even other brawlers can be played if you're slightly good at dodging brawlers like brock and colt)
---
Band aids actually not that broken. It‚Äôs good in showdown
---
Wow such an original meme!  it's not like this has been done a million times already...

#NO ONE CARES

To be fair, most of my games were mainly Shelly‚Äôs so I couldn‚Äôt really team the majority of the time - I only spun so that I could backstab them later, so that they didn‚Äôt annoy me throughout the entire game or to get out of a sticky situation üòâ

They watch kairos

Adding that peter picture sorta killed the meme

lol I was 1 game away from 800 shelly but I got afk bull teammate

Yesterday i tried to push my Bull to 20 (which i still did reach 500) but only one victory away i started to lose 3 games in a row
---
They target leon because he is good. Even after god knows how many nerfs he is still very much viable. That said, he has a high skill cap so unless you know how to use him well you‚Äôre not going to be able to shrug off people who target you. Besides, you‚Äôll find targeting happens less in higher ranks. For me anyway.

Okay okay but legit I was hyped to see this. You put a heap of effort in this like wow! It's pretty worth it if you ask me! So far, story wise, things are moving fairly smoothly and the plot is thick but still easy to follow. And ha! I love human Crow as much as I love mafia Cell.
---
And well, my main concern is the writing. I know you are trying to do like a handwritten thing, and like it changes font depending on the character. It's a nice idea, but I suggest you can maybe download free to use fonts to make it stand out but still readable. OR you can download programs to make your own font so it will look consistent.
---
Other than that, this is a good chapter and I actually did not expect the treasure to be a certain someone's lamp! Keep it up, dear!

I think people get afraid of missing shots. I‚Äôve noticed a lot of players scared to shoot at all and only want to try to rush it in goal.

Well if you consider he will stay alive to do damage.

In my opinion there should be an Indicator on which sp they have equipped this is mostly for band aid but also for others like dyna's where you think "hey I can tank that" but then nope.

Poco-Jesüò¨

They're low-key really quality skins though

You can dash towards a bush then immidietaly dash backwards to try and bait out anyone in the bush..

Keep dashing and you won't take damage. Works for me.

you're welcome, and congrats on the showcase of skill
---
Or just run towards it and dash back as soon as you're close enough to the bush
---
It sure is
---
any tank and medium health brawlers.
---
What is this Area 51 everyone keeps mentioning?
---
Slick Boots is a useful star power, people
---
Vau
---
Oh sorry, I though it was a pie and I wanted to buy one
---
1) I should point out that Tanks also have increased movement speeds, so tanks (primo Rosa bull darryl etc) are faster than average (rico barley Dyna etc)
---
2) as good as I am at dodging this is close range. Remember you are a close range brawler, trying to get closer. If you are outside of the ‚ÄúAutoaim range‚Äù then you aren‚Äôt surprising your enemy and then you need to focus on dodging, not pushing up. If you are inside it then you get shredded unless your target lags or has the reaction time of a potato. 
---
3) I don‚Äôt fucking care how good your bull is, or how bad other people‚Äôs bull is, I‚Äôm talking about bull in general and I feel the game should be balanced for pro play, or at the very least for average players. 
---
You clearly don‚Äôt know the intricacies of bull and Darryl‚Äôs super. Let me outline it for you. 
---
Bull has a set range, his super gets stopped either before water or after water. If you go after the water on say island invasion darryl can do that, as his range is theoretically infinite due to this but bull will stop. 
---
Bull breaks walls and bushes. Darryl bounces off of walls. 
---
Darryl has a much shorter range, and ‚Äúrecovers‚Äù from his super much faster. 
---
Darryl‚Äôs super charged by itself, and has an incredibly low cost. Bull on the other hand requires *over* 2 full hits to charge. 
---
So you see now the differences are in the super, they are both shotgunners with relatively high health otherwise so that‚Äôs basically their only difference. 
---
4) I mean i did mention I was one of the top mortis right? Like #14 on the leaderboard? Kinda weird for someone to tell past #14 mortis that they don‚Äôt know how mortis works lol. 
---
And yes. I team wipe as mortis. Yes mortis still needs a buff. Mortis team wipe because people are idiots and line up so mortis super stacks, these are not games of equal skill level these are games where a professional level mortis plays against a couple of 10 year olds. It‚Äôs not comparable or fair, and you will never see that in pro play. 
---
It‚Äôs not similar to shelley at all, as mortis does not hard counter the same way shelley does. Shelley deletes all close range heroes, mortis can beat throwers very well but even still there are ways they beat him (Dyna jumping over walls with star power, tick using super etc)
---
Oh ok üòÇ

Yes pls dont bring that map i like more af those cancer sniper/throwers only maps, they are so fun to play

I need to unlock three epics, two mithics and one legendary :(

That guy just made a new account just to push a brawler to 500 wow

Am I the only one that finds this funny? Ok

Naturally fast...to get nerfed

XDDD you are serious?

Thats a completly other meme

Mortis doesnt need a buff

I want this lol

it hasn't been a week since the meme started so...

I‚Äôve been there, not joking

they are on vacation.  they would work on some fix after team is back.

Thanks for the comments ,i've already done the remodel

After every box you open without a brawler in it, the odds slightly get better. If you get a brawler they reset.
---
This is accurate. Wp OP.
---
Everybody gangsta till the clanmates hits that report button on a "fricc" message
---
*Leon doesnt have noises* =(
---
Yeah, I think you pretty right. I think like rotating half bottom map is enough to make it similar. That's how all aim_ maps work :p
---
See.. if that guy won he would have only made 2 people happy (his teammates) and would have made the other 3 enemies sad. But this way he made 3 people very happy and 2 teammates sad (including you) :D

I feel like a 5 v 5 would be cool to see however u get less trophies for winning and losing and mabye a bigger map
---
Maybe he's trying to make u quit before u get addicted
---
That's not a good megabox, it was a 5% of epic, 2% of mithic, 0'1% of legendary and 10% of star power (a bit more because i've all rares and superares), all those percentages on every megabox I opened on trophie road (4 now)

Hell yea

No it's like he passed his hat to poco

I actually like it a lot. In 3v3s, I make sure to play a lane where I can poke with the curve. It takes some serious getting used to, but I actually think it‚Äôs quite good. I will agree though that the rotation always going one direction makes it very side specific which sucks. Perhaps make the spikes honing? Idk. I do think his original star is better, but curve is definitely useful.
---
I think this stuff is time wasting when it comes to skins only, it's just aesthetic, only a few exceptions mean something to me (main brawler skins for example).

That really never works, if you dash in and out, you have used two out of 3 of your most important resource, any brawler in the Bush, especially a heavyweight will whoop your ass as you are extremely close by

My brother gived my supercell id to a guy and i speaked with the ppl and he leeted my account away i send a message with this problem and the bot said me have to wait for a support agent to come shortly i waited 12 hours dude!

You mean Bo? If yes then he's good everywhere, he doesn't have bad spots.

Hey you just got crow, so the 13k 24 brawlers isn‚Äôt real
---
No need
---
And if your teammates are decent
---
Even an 8 yr old can get 10k trophies. Hes still in the age of immaturity but its still fun dyt?
---
Buy one set of token doublers and just wait for a legendary brawler offer
---
0.12%. F for me
---
I guess not. Been waiting on crow for almost 2 years now and finally got him
---
Oh wow, thanks!
---
1) no, coiled snake increases the range, not the animation speed. Plus mortis loses so much survivability off his current star power it won‚Äôt be worth it I don‚Äôt think. 
---
2) so what? Running away doesn‚Äôt help get wins, it‚Äôs only good for playing gem carrier (not his role) or 2nd place in showdown. 
---
3) not much to say here
---
4) of course you could feel it, that‚Äôs the point. Also it was 0.2 seconds buff not 0.1. 
---
5) cant say, need to see how the other buffs affect him first.
---
for hitting 11k and 13k you only get 300 coins
---
TF is this
---
what happens if someone doesnt have the brawler and they win?
---
Holy shit you are like me! Missing 2 mythics and 2 legendaries.

I got my Bo to 600 and it was a lot of work. Nice job üëç

Not op.

I get it! *I don't get it*

Yea i think you should reupload it,hopefully more people can see this instead of seeing trashy memes,good luck,il be cheering for you
---
well if they're as op as spikes new one they need trade offs
---
Hey dumbass, the game isnt easy or hard, its fucking luck based. Sure in 1 v 1 skill matters but when a bot spawns on the person winning its fucking luck.
---
It was not difficult to yet to rank 500, it just took time. And once u got to 500 you couldnt even play that brawler anymore. Gtfoh.
---
And Meteors too
---
Good for u
---
Thanks man, I‚Äôm gonna do it right now.

Soooooo good needs to be added immediately

There isn‚Äôt much skill in any of the modifiers; it‚Äôs just to provide a slight difference so it isn‚Äôt a blatant copy and reuse mental model between maps.

I done that

Crows know that a 2nd place is good enough for his trophy count and crew

Pen-Pen?
---
You‚Äôve posted about this already why again
---
I heard the death scene of ‚ÄúThe Harvest‚Äù which tbh I was kinda happy about.
---
His back "legs" is his arm and hand also his top "legs" is his legs and the left one is his other hand/arm
---
The record is 64 power ups
---
The title isnt the most appropiate
---
He is one of my highest, and he is not the worst brawler, in gem grab with a good comp he is great, or in some heist maps.
---
Hopefully people can see this master piece
---
Good idea I want it inside the game.
---
1) so more range but same speed. But it's the same as a speed increase in a way. 
---
2) running away gets u second place which is still good trophy gain, not to mention a fast gem carrier is the best.
---
3)üòÅ
---
4) it said a 0.1 second reload decrease. If it was two then they lied and it's a higher buff than I thought.
---
5) he dont need a buff though, I only agree with the range (even though it would still be abit broken) or the old star power for mortis.
---
Is this a hate comment .Cuz i am RETRADED and i dont even know that the game is just 2 years old . Btw im not actually retarded and thanks for reminding me how old the game is.THANKS

Ill put your name in the video and description if you give me a link it will make my job easier. Thank you!

Reuploaded, because:
---
1. Sucks to see low effort memes dominate the subreddit. (No offense to the people who make them, I don‚Äôt hate you.)
---
2. To promote posts with higher effort. (Mine may not be that good, but there‚Äôs so much more potential that this sub can get!)
---
Nope. You could open your next box and get it, or you might not even get it till your thousandth. I wouldn‚Äôt advise buy star powers though.
---
They were in the same game room.
---
Jesus Christ chill, just stating the facts. Also who said your retarded? Because all I said was that the game isn‚Äôt 10 years old.
---
All games should just have a ping, and even an AI-takeover. It's crazy how people will tilt so hard and continue to play. Sometimes it's the game, but more often it's your garbage internet and pathetic stubbornness. It really just ruins it for your team.
---
Have everyone but Leon and don‚Äôt plan on getting him ever
---
It already was. With the same skin, with a DIFFERENT COLOR.
---
Why do you say you couldnt play it over 500? It way the funny part, playing with the top players. I don't know what you are saying; first saying just in 1v1 skill is required (totally false), then you say in sd its not fair because of the bot spawning next to you. I would like you to understand, if you usted to lose games, it was because you were a bad player, not because of bad luck.

My first was Mortis, (PreUpdate) I immediately got him to 600 the day after. And only if I had Crow. DAMN YOU SUPERCELL!!! 13.3k Without Crow.
---
*looks at title* well yes, but actually no
---
I think it‚Äôs fine makes the game more interesting
---
Half a year And its still common to see that skin...

Why are you mad? You had decent matchmaking. Levels would mean nothing if they implemented that.

3. A pesar de que Mortis tenga una lenta recarga de b√°sicos, creo que el error que cometes es atacar brawlers como Shelly o Bull, los cuales no puedes hacer nada.. Mortis est√° hecho para atacar en el momento exacto y a Brawlers con poca vida..

---
I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs a 150 skin. Definitely not worth 300.
---
I'm not saying he has no good maps/gamemodes, i'm saying he's the worst brawler. Every brawler is better in some modes/maps than others.
---
What i'm saying is that, comparing him to the other 26 brawlers, mortis is the hardest to push, and the less useful in most maps. And by a lot.
---
Yeah ofcourse there's odd balls like you who have pushed mortis and neglected better brawlers in the same way that some people haven't pushed the most OP brawlers, it's an statistical garantee, given how many people play the game. This lone behaviour however does not make mortis not the worst brawler, or those OP brawlers less OP.
---
How do i reach to that point?
---
I mean how to get this?
---
It will be confusing for new players

The matchmaking is based on brawler, not account trophies, which makes sense. They should really make there only be able to be a 1000 account trophy difference in matchmaking (eg: a 6k could be matched with down to a 5k or up to a 7k.) This would make a big difference.

Well they don‚Äôt stop coming and they don‚Äôt stop coming. Meteors do your job because I am running. Even the ticks try to join for some fun but even an Mortis cant out run. So many tries so many deaths so much trophies lost now I‚Äôm stressed. Supercell please fix this. Because I am now pissed

Today I had frank at 80 trophies power 5. I pushed him to 300 through Duo Showdown. You gotta make sure it‚Äôs a good map for standing as a threat though. Now, the true question. How tf you a person main? I can‚Äôt play Pam for life.

Thanks!!

Crow after the buff: Well yes, but actually no

I use night mode on Reddit and Mortis is my worst(below 400) brawler. I'm a Leon main(700+) and I use discord everyday without the invisible status.

Hello. Where is your user flair?

and you think mortis is good? also i doubt you do people can literally say whatever they want and say it‚Äôs true, but i played this game the day it came out in Canada so i‚Äôve seen the ups and downs of all the characters and trust me mortis and never been worse than he is now

Yeah exactly, that's why crow didnt need the buff.

He wasnt played as intended, same thing is happening but with mortis and poco
