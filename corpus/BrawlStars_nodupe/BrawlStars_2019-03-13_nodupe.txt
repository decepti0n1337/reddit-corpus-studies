What the fuck did you just bring upon this cursed land? 0\_\_0

Your name is cool xd

Will you introduce new trophies rewards and new boxes? Copy to Angry Birds 2, because the are doing so good work with their comunity and they make them happy with their game rewards and events sistem. Will you include differents events(no tickets).

Its actually is cuz it makes you have an advantage but can also make you lose cuz of petraying

Honestly though, they must have been pissed enough to leave a bad review and OP was just looking for bad reviews so I don‚Äôt see what the big fuss is

I know right he's power 2 &lt; and he's at 300+ trophies already

It was just released on global. Give them a break. Other than that you make some good points. I didn‚Äôt know teaming had been around for that long. They should have done something in 1.5 years.

Reload speed or speed in general, if speed in general, not by much i would say. Remember she's Tara, not Sonic.

Supercell does a great job removing any incentive for a user who is wanting to buy gems following a refund. Had I required a refund‚Äîperhaps because I bought the lunar offer to only find out that Gene was recalled‚Äîthey would lose out on all the money I have spent since then. 
---
They need to withdraw the correct items (gold, gems, brawl boxes up to the mega box equivalent) in the correct amounts rather than converting the items to the overpriced gem equivalent. 
---
Yeah his star power is good
---
He is so hard to get as Leon and Spike. And have a way lower placement in the meta for a LONG time, his buffs are always pathetics. While every other brawler with a good placement already, get a buff with not really a reason.
---
He is like... Playable in Showdown... some maps, in other modes he is very meh, medium... or really bad.
---
And before someone says "Oh, you just don't know how to play him".
---
Yes, I do. When I got him, in 3 days, he was in Rank 20, lvl 4. Not that bad, but not that good. 
---
That little spin he did made it all the more better XD

The old upgrade system was the best... you would just get elixir from chests(usually 1) and with every upgrade costed an extra elixir so it would be 1,2,3,4, and 5 costing with a total of 45 elixir per brawler. This new system is more like upgrading in clash royale mean while the old system was very unique.

yea, btw incase ur wondering, it wouldnt work because teamers normally get 1st anyways so everyone would still team, i think this idea would make showdown pretty interesting and id like 2 play on it but it wouldnt change teaming

So that's where my dad went.

then..... the FLYING FORTRESS OF BLOON DOOM!!!!!
---
Wait what? Mine was 0.1008 and when i got leon it dropped to 0.0096
---
lol what
---
He is showdown and siege god
---
no. let‚Äôs put it this way:
---
-1st place bull got 3 kills, he would get +3 bonus
---
-2nd place spike got 0 kills but stayed alive would get 0 bonus
---
-3rd place mortis got 2 kills so he would get +2 bonus
---
-4th place brock got 2 kills but isn‚Äôt top 3 so he gets no bonus
---
etc.
---
Oh ok. 
---
Everyone's talking about how bad the bull is, but this is what a lot of fights would be without auto-aim. It's more frustrating then good.
---
u were teaming too
---
Ahahahah awsome
---
R E A D Y  T O  S E R V E

So, you will keep the current amount of gems, but you will add a bonus of kills ...

Nice!

Teaming is cheating

*Instantly runs out of money*

First thing, matchmaking is based off of alot of things, trophies included. I did a but of math and your team had a total of 1089 trophies. The other team had 979, which is a difference of 110 trophies. Compared to other screenshots, this gap is nothing. When comparing power level your team had a total of 26, while the other team only had 25. In both situations, your team had higher trophies and levels, meaning you have better skill and better brawlers. Please don't come complaining to the Reddit about little issues of how you lost to players that are lower than you. 
---
i never team with crow and hes my favorite brawler to use. patience and practice is all it takes
---
I got crow on Friday and spike and tara today, all without spending a dime. 
---
Im at 8.5küòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Most skins in the game are already pretty much changed the color only
---
r/woooosh /s
---
I can give you mine. I bought it on sale.
---
Yes, but consider this:
---
Even if you team and get to be in the last 2, if you lose the final showdown you are still only getting 2 trophies. Same as 3rd or 4th. Sure, maybe you could get lucky sometimes and defeat your "teammate" with less power cubes than he's got, but to consistently win 1st place, you would need a lot of power cubes and actually go out there and kill people.
---
If you let your "teammate" steal power cubes from you, or let him be the one that kills people, it pretty much guarantees you are losing at the end.
---
So by teaming (or camping), if you don't actually do anything, it will only give you 2 cups per match, tops. And that is if you get 2nd, 3rd or 4th only, in a consistent way.
---
I don't think it is worth the grind for 2 cups per game.
---
doong 
---
Pam is the new dynamike
---
GG. Wish I had a legendary I every brawler besides the letendaries
---
I was about to say that, good at ya 
---
Meanwhile this guy has 338 trophies and has Crow idfk how df he even got that. And he never played in a month
---
You‚Äôve been playing since beta and call star player, MVP?
---
I wouldn‚Äôt take that as a sign. I don‚Äôt really push trophy count unless there are rewards and have higher lvl characters because of it
---
Oh, yeah. Buff Crow, totally.
---
Thanks for reading!
---
Ok, thanks for letting me know
---
Not literally
---
Well i guess im just Hatin as i see Darryl Rollin =S
---
It doesn‚Äôt reset it drops. The higher the tier the more the chance drops. I believe unboxing a legendary drops it by 0.06-0.06%, and each lower level drops it by a lower percentage. 
---
Wow you can camp in a Bush!?
---
Why are you disappointed? You're super rare chances dont go down and you get 2 new brawlers?
---
Legendary chances only reset on Legendary boxes - in fact opening boxes actually increases your chances so if you're going for a Legendary OPENDEMBOXES (I have a maxxed out account feelsgoodman.jpg, also -$150 dollars feelsbadman.mp3 (I hope Ryan got himself a coffee or some shit))
---
How I felt when I got all mine rank 20 ;)

I like these ideas except for the legendary box.

This is a really good idea because it will motivate players not to team for a higher trophy gain incentive.
---
It stands for personal best. Which means the highest trophies your brawler has ever gotten whether it was this week or last year.

Pretty much everyone here agrees with you and they should remove them and bring back the normal showdown.

Not trying to show off but I've been playing since beta and I've done that loads of times! It's kind of funny how that happens

I think this game is quick to max out, I‚Äôve been playing over a year , and I‚Äôm just 2 star power away to be max. While playing clash Royale for 3 years and my maxed out cards might be 5. I can max out 10 more but I need over 1 million coins which is impossible lol. That‚Äôs why I stopped playing cr 
---
To be fair Flirsk, you are acting like a fking nazi lol
---
No one ever said crow was bad in showdown at hiding in bushes and flying away with his super.. let‚Äôs be real homie that‚Äôs the only actual viable strategy to get him to rank 20 at power 1. He‚Äôs not as bad as people say but he‚Äôs definitely in need of some kind of a buff or rework to make him more viable in this meta.

---
You might want to work on your blackout ability. I can pretty easily read those names. Then again, names aren't special, they don't really need blacking out, I don't think.
---
This one is one of the most brilliant ideas I‚Äôve ever seen to solve teaming, but there is one problem. Let‚Äôs take this example: there‚Äôs 4 brawlers left, 3 dynamikes with 1 cube and a shelly with 8 cubes. Even though this idea cannot guarantee teaming to stop, everyone wants 1st place for themselves, so wouldn‚Äôt the 3 dynamikes still team to take the shelly out, as they know that shelly is the main problem for all 3 dynamikes to get 1st for themselves, and after that possibly kill the other two dynamikes to get 1st?
---
auto aim isn't supposed to be a crutch lmao everything is and should be same level of priority. it gets some skill in there for you auto aim spammers lol
---
So annoying! It's just too fast. If it was a little slower, there would be a chance to get away from it.
---
Small speed nerf really like -5% would work because when trying to run away with a slow brawler, you could get destroyed
---
Nice concept bro. I love how you make it so that it's easy to grab the gems.

While i love autoaim, making it always target power box make contesting the box requires much more skill. I approve supercell choice.

a better one being (for a star power) changing the skin to brawler you killed for a couple seconds.

Gedi u remember me 
---
Huh, interesting. I‚Äôll have to check out the recent AMA answers. I‚Äôve only seen their responses about teaming being a strategy. 
---
Other then the bonus for only top 3, I think this would work great. With only top 3 getting the bonus I think players might team till top 3 then instantly kill their teammate though. I wonder if it would work having every placement able to earn the bonus. Then getting kills would help against any negative trophies due to placement. Could add something else like the player with the most kills get an additional +1 trophy or something like that to better encourage kills. 
---
If it‚Äôs possible, I think that‚Äôs a good idea to award the bonus trophy to the player that gets the kill as long as they didn‚Äôt do very minimal damage to finish them. Kill stealing would definitely be a problem if you earn trophies per kill. Maybe some kind of set damage limit so that if you get a kill + do at least 25-35% HP of the damage you get a bonus trophy.

Everyday the devs choose one community map to add in the game. If the map is yours you will be rewarded with 50 gems. Also once a week the best/unique map is called "The Map Of The Week" . If this map is yours you will be rewarded with 100 gems and you will also get a special badge on your profile.

---
Yeah and idea to get ticket or boxes which gives you gold back is an idea that makes sense. 
---
Well giving 5 gems for 1000 gold is stupid but giving gems in a brawl box is not.

Keep on brawling .

Can they release a new update that quickly though?

I personally thought green hinted an update for Easter...

But I still hope for something to happen on St Patrick's Day. 
---
How often do you plan to take out new brawlers?
---
Dancing with death itself
---
Boxes give you the chance for new brawlers. And if you could buy boxes they will eventually have the new brawlers. Its less stupid because gaining gems in boxes still rely on rng loot boxes.
---
Removed - DO NOT SUBMIT POSTS WITH TITLES IN ALL CAPS. CAPS LOCK IS CRUISE CONTROL FOR COOL
---
After reading some of your comments and feedback, I could make a few changes to the reward system.
---
First idea:
---
Instead of -2, 0 +2 and +10, I would change it to -3, 0, +3, +9.
---
It would still give the winner +6 cups more than 2nd place, but it would only take 3 bad games to lose your 9 cups, instead of 5.
---
It punishes bad performance just a little bit more, but it is still tolerable enough so you don't feel the need of teaming.
---
Second idea:
---
Using the same -3, 0 +3 +9 structure, instead of grouping 10th, 9th, 8th and 4th, 3rd and 2nd together...
---
It would give
---
10th: -3
---
9th: -2
---
8th: -1
---
7th, 6th, 5th: 0
---
4th: +1
---
3rd: +2
---
2nd: +3
---
1st: +9
---
That way people wouldn't team against the strongest brawler, since you could risk losing trophies if someone betrays you or the brawler with the most power cubes kills you. It gives the player that kills the most an advantage.
---
What do you think?
---
Disco time!
---
Hello, as some skins are really expensives and get gems in boxes is really slow, I want to suggest of you can add the chance to get random skins in the boxes with a very low chance or make a skin box where you get a random skin and make that skin boxes hard to get

Wait! that's not possible cuz' there r only 23 brawlers....
---
r/woosh
---
I can‚Äôt do this
---
One word 3D-walls
---
Lol same
---
yea :u
---
Its part of the brawler, I think that is for more difficult to shoot like other brawler like that is leon
---
51?! Damn! 
---
Agreed worth reading üëåüèΩ
---
Spin to win
---
tysm
---
Cacnea*
---
It‚Äôs the cold hard truth,gotta face it
---
Name suits the player 
---
Spent money and playing quite a lot stuck at 5,8k
---
He real boys
---
10k since global!? How
---
Lol
---
That's impressive im still stuck at 7.6k played since global too
---
It happens more than ppl think. Not as much as clash royale though 
---
I an at 7,5k with no Darryl/Frank/Pam/mythics/legends, every brawler except Piper is at 500+, please stop whining!
---
Nope supercell already said that they aren‚Äôt gonna add it since it changes how SD works,it will remove the objective to survive.Also,wouldn‚Äôt it suck when someone else took your kill?
---
Grrrrrr
---
Petition to stop saying petition but rather "idea".
---
smh
---
It‚Äôs this thing called probability :/
---
Sorry for the repost, but do you think that this kind of map is possible in-game?
---
I like rico better üòÇ colts star power is also good üëç
---
It wouldn‚Äôt work. It‚Äôs already a grind trying to score. This would result into too many stalemates
---
Damn 3k trophies and you have leon....
---
i got to 5k a few minutes ago too
---
PS. while attacking with bo move left if you're against one enemy, move right if your against multiple
---
So just stfu and get along with it I‚Äôm at 9.2k without legend and gene(played since beta)
---
#P h a t 
---
What do you mean I don't get it
---
Till now I've collected 4 big boxes and 62 brawl boxes.
---
What is the N word?
---
He supered before Shelly aimed her super. I think he was just trying to jump Shelly from the bush.
---
You didn‚Äôt even get anything
---
Nope, it wouls break the meta completely.
---
My friend is 9500 with 17 brawlers
---
Did you print it or something like that?
---
not as terrifying as night witch mortis
---
*cough cough* robo rumble *cough* boss fight *COUGH*
---
So?its just luck I haven‚Äôt gotten a brawler since August last year
---
No one cares
---
Livin like Larry
---
- The amalgamate appears!
---
Wait which rarity is he? 
---
This madman did it
---
how to counter bull, get near a box
---
Playing A LOT
---
Yes..my favorite brawlers can't be used anymore. Pity.
---
I thought I was doing decently with 9.6k in the same time. Q.Q feels bad man, still need crow. Q.Q
---
No
---
His hat is so disproportionate in the first one hahah
---
That time when colt appear in battlefield
---
That‚Äôs insanely good.
---
Why does sound fun?
---
r/LeonGang dissaproves. Your Leons will be confiscated and relocated with players that don't team in SD.
---
My brawl stars name is biggest boy lol
---
Too good for Molotov and dynamite
---
lol thanks
---
Can anybody answer this question. Please it‚Äôs really important! So will you please change the matchmaking system to be where if you do not have anybody else on your team and you are playing randoms, then matchmaker with others who are also doing randoms. I know this change will only help 5000 trophy or less players but please atleast take this into consideration!
---
Omae wa mo, shindeiru
---
Perch√© non trovo un brawler da 2 mesi?
---
Mi date un brawler epico
---
Spike's super is too much for a lot of modes I think, especially maps with choke points.
---
But I made a lot of bushes.
---
Yep that account is f2p since android release... i dont play every day though
---
Pass the parcel

Narmul' haroshaia karta

It's pretty good(Unlike most of the maps we see posted on here)!

Would be a great map for throwers to shine on Seige(If they don't already, I don't keep that up to date with Brawl Stars Meta)

True

Rambo Rico or Tropic Thunder Rico
---
I prefer cyclops, this detail make robot folk unique!
---
Playing since july 2018, maxed my account without money and got 21/23 brawler ( need spike and gene) spent about 20‚Ç¨ for special offers only to buy skins
---
At 350 trophies? Really? 
---
Vorrei trovare perch√© non trovo pi√π niente
---
Yeah I got that feel too. I couldn't find a balance between making it look alive (in a haunted painting kind of way). Either came across as an ornament or a weird creature sitting on her forehead, so I settled with the ornament thing. Maybe as my skill improves I'll find a way to do better with that lol. I appreciate the feedback and I'm glad you like it :)

$17 11,000 23/23 all brawlers maxed. Bought Leon and Gene with gems and been playing since the very beginning also just recently got spike

Smh I played for a year and I‚Äôm only at 5.4 k (highest is 5.5 k) trophies
---
Good idea!
---
Back when 270 was a fairly high trophy count because you only won two and lot 3 above 200
---
Thanks!üî•
---
I think he's not a robot
---
Yes but to late now :(
---
Not even a high skill cap brawler 
---
I feel bad for you dude. 
---
Now that is epic
---
the struggle was real.
---
Okay, but first... 
---
*i need a leon*
---
I saw this skin scrolling really fast. I was like woah, bet that it was u/GEDI-KOR
---
He already gave birth to thinnochet
---
How did you make this look **SO GOOD**?
---
wtf did you just bring upon this cursed land 0\_\_0 
---
yeah das what I did
---
OH MY FUCKƒ∞NG GOOOOODDD IM WALKƒ∞NG ON THE WATERRR
---
r/woooosh 
---
Ok this is mythic
---
No its fine i was just joking around
---
Bro you this skin is so beautyful just make more like this you are the BEST
---
These people make feel luckiest person on life, 'cause I got Spike from a big box, lol.
---
This is so cool! I would totally buy this.
---
I love the turret
---
Not unfair advantage, but just changing the tactics, both sides has it's own advantages and disadvantages, it spices the gameplay in my opinion.
---
And also RNG becomes an important factor. Maybe you aren't getting the side that "fits" your team. Which puts more risk into the game,and make it harder to choose the overall best team .
---
TL;DR: having asymetry changes the rootine in each game, with more possible outcomes instead of one. An Anti-META map I guess. 
---
Hell yes
---
GG, dude! Nice work!
---
I don't like Rico, but this skin is awesome bro!
---
how can force supercell to put this in the game
---
Outstanding! You are a beast man!
---
I love this
---
Thats soo good man
---
i completely agree, hopefully they bring it back
---
niggachet? (just kidding lol) . looks good tho! 
---
I see GEDI KOR, I upvote 
---
Masterpiece!
---
Loooove this!!!
---
I love her blue hair and the fish turret!
---
I'm on this as well, I pushed 2 brawlers to 500, now I'm just chilling with them around 400 no stress whether I win or not. 
---
Wait for 50 gems
---
Happy to hear you like it. Really love your concepts as well too, always made me smile even before I made an account here üòÅ
---
Pretty sure he is, he got robo arms and a very artificial body in general
---
This is a good idea
---
As u/Gregorian7 already said, the RNG of the boxes affects that a lot. In addition to it, there are times when you get free power-ups (ex - two Brawlers killing each other). But yeah, I see your point. When you work hard for those power-ups, the person teaming can be unfair. I think  Showdown really needs some tweaks right now, like revamp of the whole power cubes system. A single power up makes little to no difference, but as you start getting power-ups, it becomes almost impossible to win. Instead of increasing the stats, the power-ups should have temporary effects -- like energy drink. I think that might solve the issue of those two person teams as well.   
---
On a side note, I used Bull just as an example. Almost all of the Brawlers become too strong with a large number of  power-ups (yes I know, that's what power-ups are supposed to do).  
---
This is a great idea.
---
In proper GW fashion 
---
Yea
---
Is Carl a robot?
---
I would pay 80 gems just for the turret!!!
---
Oh yes, I definitely love what he did with Tara
---
2nd should at least get 4 trophies.if 1st reward is 10 trophies.I agree with your idea and its awesome but trophy is 80% less for 2nd guy.2nd gets 4 trophies and 3rd gets 3 trophies and so on with your list.
---
I won't restart the time if the enemy team control
---
I don't like Tara, but bro, this designs are amazing! You must have more upvotes!
---
She definitely has potential for some awesome skins 
---
Barley is within the Dynamikes.
---
I see those now, but you shouldn't be forced to go to the middle to get a huge tactical advantage. 
---
Dude stop complaining u got a legendary and a mythic already. Judging by the amount of trophies the brawlers we can see have you must not be too high so seriously stop.
---
awesome
---
you lagged a bit but gg

I leon, found in a normal box!

cool

Yo u/cloudydaes didn't know u were a for honor fan as well! Good on you!

I swear I saw a skin of rico with ricochet costume (still thicc body but with hat, x eye, scarf etc) I forgot the name though
---
Idk, hard to tell whether it‚Äôs throwing or really bad lag
---
Ye I do the same. I try to team and then kill them. works like a charm.

Thanks broüëä

Oh this Jessie looks like style of Little Witch Academia, this is from Netflix ^^

Coins and points

Looks like game throwing

I was joking I feel ur pain my dude, u was once there, hope u get mortis

Whoa!! This would make a great Halloween skin for Brawl Stars, well done dude!! Please make more Astonishing skins, I can hardly wait!!!

Well, he has a pretty robotic body

Love it ! Like this is worth praising

please feel free to criticise or elaborate on this

Great skin, u/GEDI-GOR!

You are a wizard Harry.Great job as always.Maybe you could make big smoke frank :D?
---
Darn
---
Uhum
---
I bought the points because I have an insane excess of coins and gems atm and have been waiting for a legendary brawler. Finally got him two days ago and bought the points to level him up a bit. Special offers are pretty situational on how much their worth depending on where your account stands. 
---
LOLOL
---
welcome! :) did you apply for a job at supercell? 
---
Yeah that‚Äôs weird. So far I‚Äôm F2P, starting this game at launch, playing every day to get my tokens. And I‚Äôm at 3.5k
---
No. Its their fault if they bought NW mortis even though they did not like it.
---
I think he isn‚Äôt a robot...
---
Woah you outdid yourself with this one! 
---
Very high on duo, on solo it is over 40 thought
---
You see names like that a lot though :|
---
Idk how they get away with it but they do
---
Love the idea
---
Can do you do a skin of solar spike, and for easter a skin of   rabit brock? Sorry if I write bad, regards from Spain. :D
---
good job as usual

Nah, well played and congrats dude

Bro spike is a man and a very manly one you gotta respect his main

It's a good ideea, but there is an another problem, low trophies players don't understand the survival aspect of this mode, they are just going for killis.

Yee, but still made it 7u7

this is a really bad idea

_New generation of Brawl Stars map editors_
---
The thing is brawl stars is balanced so he's not really a bad brawler but he is the worst in the game and again not everyone is a pro player most of us are probably around 3000-6000 trophies.

That's a good idea

Hey!

So I was playing with my phone yesterday because a got bored and I found out that you can play BRAWL STARS IN PORTRAIT MODE.

So I decided to share it with you guys because I know some of you LOVED the old portrait mode.

I don't know if you can do that on IOS ( I haven't tried yet ) but you can do it on Android.

Hope you like it!

Lets try to get this to the front page of the subreddit, I'd love for a Supercell employee to read this. Excellent idea my dude! You have gained my upvote.

Why the pro gamers in the game is easy? Example: I has seen a pro gamer in roborumble with that shake that multiply your power or the green flash and regular gamer don't see that.
---
Wait for carl

Supercell, PLEASE ADD THIS REMODEL AND SKIN FOR TARA!

This is not portrait

Omg you wrote a lot and i read all...

But you hold your phone up like you see in the video.
---
Ok its seems better
---
Do NOT underestimate Frank, he‚Äôs secretly OP
---
Maybe not the best way to say that powercubes should be the best method to win, but you get my point right? 
---
Imagine playing as bull or shelly, and some how the RNG god blessed you with 5 power-up. Then, you got 6 more by stealing boxes, beating the robot or finishing an enemy. You placed 8th, 9th, or even last because these thrower, pam, jessie, whatever ganged up on you. After all the time you played in showdown, you tried the hardest, but these teamer only need to spin and safely killed others to secure their top 5. My point is, playing fair is a punishment in solo showdown and it is not fun at all, it is a pain to get those star token above 400. 
---
Super cell needs to hire this guy 
---
Notice that Shelly and no spinning right before they got killed. Whatta NoobsüòÇ
---
&lt;3 
---
Supercell I want that skin... I like all creepy concepts
---
Interesting idea but only 2 cups for 2,3 and 4th, no one is going to play sd anymore.  This is not enough cups.  While a 3v3 team can easily earn 5 cups in no time in heist, sd players would basically be grinding for nothing.  Also people would still team, why would they stop, same thing team and then backstab at the end to win.  Teamers are still going to dominate the top 4 spots, this has only reduced the overall cups available in sd which is not fair.
---
I'd say this is fake. I've seen this before.
---
There is too much content that the community wants
---
Also, Supercell said they wont remodel Night Witch Mortis
---
Jeah but that is not portrait
---
Gedi Kor are you single?

This one‚Äôs on the house!

A good crow player doesn't either. You shouldn't be going in for burst damage with crow unless you can jump in and confirm a kill.

I'm in love

Nice 1 bro...my fav so far.Love all yr works!!Stay awesome.
---
No it is too small

I thought so too, pretty hard to hit the super.
---
nita map not brock
---
I honestly hope this get into the game, and there is absolutely no reason in heaven or hell for supercell to not address this well thought out idea
---
140 pp cost 280 gold so that offer is even worse than the gold offer above it
---
To destroy the safe you need to use a super fighter.All in advance, thought out! ü§ì
---
Why?
---
You don‚Äôt really have a reason to support your point

nope. i have gf :)

you have about a 99 percent chance of not getting any brawler out of it

trust me, i've seen many 4k troohy mega box openings

Oh fuck
---
Crazy how good you are, keep doing what you do!

Yeah, and how much time does it take to whittle someone down till that point from afar? You expect that noone will interfere the whole time?
---
2.6k with 19 brawlers. Ezpz p2w. 
---
Nah I got better in my YT vid called "Pushing Barley to 340!"
---
Are you gonna do something like a battle pass?
---
And if you do, it will be free or not?
---
GEDI-KOR IS THE ONE AND ONLY OPPA
---
Uh oh
---
It just feels wrong. I may grind them above 15 in that one bounty map where there's only bushes.
---
Time to roll
---
I'd totally buy this!
---
I have spent seven bucks, just under 3200 trophies but I really can't say the money I spent has done anything, I guess a few bucks helps for token doublers for a long time, but I've spent enough time on the game that seven dollars is totally fine for me. It is definitely not a p2w game 
---
Oh god, this is so awesome!
---
Supercell really need to see this :D
---
Maybe too much scenery. Would be incredibly difficult to score a goal on this map.
---
1 Leg btw
---
I absolutely love your content, thank you for all the work you do!
---
He‚Äôs only ridiculous if you don‚Äôt know how to dodge him. 
---
i said that yesterday 
---
now i have mortis at 440
---
How about a 5% damage buff to his super and his main attack if not enough then a 10% after to a total of 15%.
---
Hi, I have an idea for a new minigame.
---
 This is an 8-player game mode in which 3 players appear outside a barrier and 1 inside the barrier, players who are outside the barrier have to kill the other players. to strengthen the one inside the barrier Meanwhile the one inside the barrier has to kill robots to defend themselves when the barrier is destroyed the strengthened player has to kill the other player to win 
---
ATT: Alberto Sa√∫l player of braw stars

is only An idea this can be modified.

Took the 140 pp deal now got a lvl 8 Leon

In general, I'd play more showdown but the biggest problem is the huge penalties for a loss. In duo, bad matchmaking can put you at a serious risk through no fault of your own. And in either solo or duo, the randomness of spawn location can put you at a serious disadvantage again through no fault of your own.
---
So I think your idea is about right. Reducing the loss risk is important as is reducing the bonuses for anything but first place. This reduces teaming probably but it also would generally make me want to play more showdown because the negatives from randomness aren't as bad.
---
Have you thought about putting some way to test the skins before buying them? (Sorry for my English, i use the traductor)
---
I prefer night witch Mortis just being "creature"
---
I buy this skinüòçüòç
---
It's better if someone interferes. Then you can alternate shots and poison them both. High damage is not the most important stat in a lot of modes.
---
I am a huge Darryl fan, I highly recommend trying him out more 
---
I think you also need to be good
---
Crow is probably the best legendary. I dont have spike, but i can say that he is 100% better than leon
---
Bayonetta, is that you?
---
Wow, your ideas are incredible, keep it up 
---
Wow! Is the turret the cauldron? 
---
Most of those names were Japanese and Korean.
---
I like it but the problem is brawl stars team don't want to make your idea real this is *talent wasted* ,I hope they let you on the team someday ‚ù§
---
I want brawlers to work harder to score a goal.
---
Sorry, I am new to this game, so can you please explain why you can't play with Leon anymore? 
---
10k in 3 months? Smells bad. Did you sink any money into the game?
---
AMAZING as always. They should hire you.
---
You should stop buying stuff and trying to get a refund on something you used.
---
Wow this is  better  Then dragonknight  jessie !
---
Hes probably put out more ideas by himself than the entire supercell team has in 2 years
---
Yeah, but you need to have high damage potential in certain cases. I'm a power 3 crow at 270 trophies, I know, not that impressive, but I know I can play him relatively well, at least. I think he needs atleast a small damage buff, or his poison needs to be increased by one tic
---
you technically don't need to spend a penny to get to 10k. Even an [YouTuber](https://www.youtube.com/user/ClashNerd) is on his way to proving it. 
---
Yes he might have spend money, but u can't be sure of it
---
Thanks for pointing out how this is better than bans. A ban system is never going to work for this game so people need to move on and push for something that can actually work, like this.
---
Now I remember why I want to commit squidrankel this haunts me in my dreams.
---
Omg i would so buy this skin! 
---
I need to see a ma-gene-buu
---
What do you think the right time to increase the rarity?Have you had this plan recently?
---
If they could incorporate a bit of ricochet into a skin for Rico that'd be cool imo. I like Rico better since he stands out more from the generic bots of the game you'd see in the special event modes
---
Wow...
---
The packs were actually bought by my younger cousin. I didn't use the gems and asked for a refund. I am guessing the amount added up because of the price of each mega box in store... still, it seems like a lot of gems!
---
it basically does nothing
---
What the fuck, I‚Äôve been playing since the first few days of softlaunch and I just hit 8k
---
This is the first skin idea ive seen that id try to buy if its in game. Good work on it
---
I doubt Super cell is going to invest resources to make a completely new game inside an already popular game to solve boredom.
---
I don't think they gonna add this skin to the game,because...because why to spend your time...work on a new skin if you already have 3 and can just sit on the sofa and eat popcorn
---
Yeah, unfortunately now they go back on refunds and deduct the gems. You‚Äôll have to either deal with the deficit or buy gems to get positive again. ü§∑üèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
"Don't team with bull" fits better
---
Tbh we are talking about different things here, meaning, its 150 power points vs unlocking a fucken brawler the comparison ur making, u get me? Besides it's a good offer after all (the 1 of gene)
---
I love this one so much, though I can't help but think it would fit as well or better with Penny. I wish Halloween skins weren't 7 months away. 
---
My question is, could you change gene' s name, to Eugene? And in spanish instead of genio would be Eugenio hahaha i think it would be better than dinamike!! 
---
That's so many gems! Darn. 
---
Maybe not grenates but it looks awesome
---
U get 20 tokens per lvl
---
Lwarb Beta
---
Nah, i just mean that if you want to play without loosing trophies this could be fun. But well i'm a nerd i know.
---
and better ones too
---
How many gems would it cost because I don't have like 80 gems 100 gems and stuff like that
---
I see, is he the only character that gets that visual effect with star power? I have Shelly and Colt at 10 but haven't seen it with them.
---
why? like genuinely what's the reason. Is it cause they still don't resource to make a proper report system? then I'll respect the choice and let them develop. But if they just don't want players to be reported, then that's just stupid
---
HOLY MOTHER OF GOD. Amazing amazing amazing no words. Hands down the best I've seen from you great work my guy.
---
Or he‚Äôs just...good
---
Hey! Good Game! Sorry for the rough matchmaking. We ended up beating most of the top players in the queue so it started putting us up against players with fewer trophies than us
---
Witch what aplication do you do skins?
---
I'm at 6.8k from android launch...
---
I don't think you can dodge a good dynamike. He's very OP in almost every game mode. His range is too long and his hit diameter is too big. On a map with multiple walls to hide behind it's almost impossible to get around to him and if he knows how to move even slightly well he'll kill you before you get around the wall. 
---
nice!
---
I hear he's a pretty cool guy üòÅ
---
oh, r u korean?
---
Nope but it's double sided
---
Yep
---
But that‚Äôs a real sub you dumbass
---
Is it legal to give an account?
---
OMG UR 2 STRONG
---
I‚Äôm not trying to argue. I‚Äôve done it multiple times against top players. Especially in gem grab. 
---
He is still really good but I wouldn‚Äôt say he is really good to the point of being OP
---
Oh thanks, You can checkout my other game mode idea:

Good doesnt play a big factor in the current brawl star. Being good alone is useless without a good team in 3vs3. Solo being good especially juking is quite nice but ultimately teamming prevails. Your point?

so true
---
I said report, not ban. Reporting players doesn't necessarily mean they need to be banned. They can get penalties. I'm more interested in reporting teammates than enemies. Teammates who purposedly spin in same place, or just run into the enemy without even trying etc
---
Also it like to tell let have 200 tokens available when I know I don't. I open the app and to everyone's supprise!.... Still just 16 tokens available.

ppl are welcome to steal it

Yeah... Gems.
---
I absolutely love this skin concept, I think the ski mask fits el primo‚Äôs aesthetic perfectly.
---
I love this. Similar to the cwl structure in Clash of Clans. Punish bottom 2, average out the middle, greatly reward only 1st place.
---
Probably your best skin yet. And if it‚Äôs YOUR best skin, it means it‚Äôs the whole SUBREDDITS best skin (cus obviously nobody makes as good skins as you, legend!)
---
Amazing
---
If you are not serious player then stop complaining about not having a brawler, and btw no one cares what you have or you dont have, tHe Hek Ar YoU?

/u/Ryan_supercell please check this idea!

Elegant idea to make it have no connection to Coc and CR.

All the time. I just remembered to screenshot this one.
---
I never use nita in showdown
---
hello supercell I would ask if you can give me more chances of having a legendary brawler I've been playing this game since it came out globally and opened many boxes and they would not come out I would ask them please if they could give me one or raise the probability thank you very much for your attention
---
Well this allows u to get 2 megacrates, its tour choice

Yep!  Its on 19 November

Wtf that frank doing boe

Good but there is only one chokepoint
---
Those are power cubes! But nice job
---
Yeah but he doesn't team because he is good at the game?
---

---
Once you pass 500 you shouldnt drop below it
---
Darryl
---

Leon‚Äôs is nice

Franks is good in siege and bb
---

---
Solution: system of report with a video.
---
Add this rule: Teaming in showdown for more than 1 minute is bannable if you send a video in a reporting system (e.g. sending to an email for this kind of report, so an employee of supercell will ban only an ABUSE of teaming, maybe 2 range browler can team vs El primo or bull, but not all the game.)
---
Not all the the teamers will receive a ban, but the risk to get a ban will reduce the teamers more and more.
---
First ban: 1 day (writing the reasons of the ban)
---
Second ban: 3 day
---
And so on
---
I found an error in your post:
---
&gt;Remember, **10th, 9th and 8th *get* 2 cups**, 7th, 6th, 5th don't win or lose anything, 4th, 3rd and 2nd get 2 cups, and 1st place *receives* 10 trophies.
---
It should say:
---

---
Anyways, great and original idea.
---
The water might make it difficult to reach screws in time and could be frustrating but it looks really good
---
That's the only scenario where teaming is ok. When one player takes all the powercubes
---
Those 3 enemy players are from the same Nova clan
---
-Only for your team aswell- This part would be bad but poisonous to enemy team is good but enemy will lose health BUT won't be seen at same time
---
No but he also won't attack a weaker player if it increases his chances of winning. RNG is in every video game, including this one (random spawns and boxes). No need to be toxic
---
close out of the app. you'll be marked as offline and a game won't start then you'll be able to kick him.
---
Everything
---
Yes, remove the very characteristic of crow that makes him legendary
---
This isnt possible. Some military lady is going to yell at rico for wearing it without actually serving.
---
This is so cool oml
---

---
Still
---
Brawl ball
---
Supercell please. I'll shell out 200 Gems for this
---
I would be happier if he had a bit not wider (if the exact word sry) attack at the max range. It is being hard to hit 2/3 daggers at once sometimes
---
Then who made Carl was rather confused on the use of glasses
---
Yeah but this was braw ball
---
He got me
---
Depends on the dupe, can be OP very quickly however, example: playing with 2 pams in gemgrab
---
Is it able to get dev. app for 6000+ trophies or not
---
 Could you put especial events in friendly matches?
---
Maybe because he isn't a retard?
---
Anyway.
---
In every situation he would be called a teamer by somebody,because if he tried to shoot the bull,he would be indirectly "teaming" with the other guy with 1 power cube, if he tried to shoot the guy with 1 power cube then he would be indirectly teaming with the bull.

Wow... its beautiful. üò¢
---
Exactly my point, when you receive a new brawler, cheap power points can be nice! 
---
Only '90s kids will remember this
---
Buying a deal to choose which brawler gets powerpoints is rlly goo. For ex, I got no offers on my lvl 2 Pam but that deal got her to lvl 5
---
I will tell you when i start it okay ?

You never bought the level 5 pack whenever they offered it to you the first time

Oh no pool party 2.0

Thank you

\*Creature of the night\*
---
No, he‚Äôs quite usable in for example quite a few gem grab maps, I even see him every now and then on bounty. Though yes, he does need a buff to be a bit MORE fitting into the meta, but what I‚Äôm saying is that he isn‚Äôt a terrible brawler and literally unplayable as a lot of people are saying.
---
Randoms: oh no I lost

Also randoms: **reports team

Ill follow you btw Leon skin would be cool!!!

---
Thanks for the shaming, i went and spent the 5 dollars from the refund on gems again cause i couldnt get in touch with anyone or anything that could help me. 
---
Good
---
yeah, in duo, it's pretty unnessacary. In solo, maybe. Like meteorites, or healing mushrooms, energy drinks, unless you're a random barley who breaks boxes for people then to watch them fight, then if they have low health, get the upper hand and kill them before they kill you :), then get the powercubes
---
Actually if you keep clicking the same spot, on the boxes while opening them too you will keep opening them but it may be good if there was a open x10 x2 x5 open all... or at least instant open one box with one click, not 10 clicks per box
---
 Personally, I much prefer this one. It looks like it would actually be in the game, as apposed to an overhyper fan design. Phloropes was just a hair too much for me. I do like some of his other designs though.
---
Grasias por crear este juego pero me gustaria que las esquins de los personajes se puedan comprar con oro
---
Boxes are designed to give brawlers with the biggest presence an advantage which explans the shotgunners and generalists thriving
---
Tiger Nita, Pumpkin Spike, ATM Rico, and Chicken Crow move up 1 tier, Bathtub Carl shouldn't be there at all, Kimono Leon moves down 2 tiers, Musketeer Penny, Carnival Pam, and Veteran Colt move down 1 tier, and nothing is Night Witch Mortis level
---
My contention was that brawlers with high damage like shelly spam autoaim and destroy mortis
---
Dino Darryl is an awesome idea! Probably my favorite lol 
---
probably using lowercase L as uppercase I   (NlBBA vs NIBBA)
---
Oooof hacking
---
No the lines
---
No it‚Äôs not punk plus u only got half of what he has 
---
No offense and not tryna be rude it's only my opinion but I hate asymmetric maps
---
*Nibba*
---
Yeah absolutely something like that, that makes the process of opening 30+ boxes easier üëç
---
Wow. I love it
---
Good art, really I love it. But I can‚Äôt see real life grenades in brawl stars. Maybe a cartoony version like Spike‚Äôs, but I‚Äôm not sure how that would work. Nice skills though

Short and low effort posts, amirite?
---
if you look at 1:03, the Darryl was going towards him, but then decides randomly to walk away, despite having 28 powercubes, Darryl at the end of his shot could've killed dynamike
---
If you're talking about the Darryl . . . . . . . . . then a complete noob, look at 1:03
---
Is foot brawl supposed to be a new game mode
---
This would be OP for Dyna with his Star Power if there aren't any throwers are long-range brawlers to counter him from the river.
---

---
Tiger Nita is a pretty uninspired concept imo
---
‚ÄòPumpkin‚Äô Spike is and orange Spike with a hat and mustache lol, how would it not get the same reception as NW Mortis if it were released
---
ATM Rico seems pretty redundant considering Loaded, I thought I was being pretty generous
---
I thought Kimono Leon was pretty cool
---
Everything else is a matter of opinion

Night Witch Mortis Tier? You could've at least made it nicer. Show some respect for Gedi\_kor.

What if dynamike is in her dress (don‚Äôt ask) and when she uses her super dynamike drops the bombs üí£. That would explain the dynamite and Piper always sounding like she just got  a D up her.

Frank is one of the worst brawlers rn lmao. either stay out of his range or get right in his face and swap the side of him you‚Äôre on. he‚Äôs countered by a good amount of the cast

Omg

Same name colour too? I don't buy that.

Respect.

As a Crow player I do the same. I will spend the whole match harassing the 1 player who stole my power cube.

Matchmaking
---
People at 500 are getting matched against people at 700

And people on teams can get matched with people who are playing with randoms, so if you play with friends you will rarely lose because more people play with randoms than you think.

I'm hoping it's implemented.

Thanks it means a lot coming from you, I love your work, you've made some really stellar pieces. I usually just start with base colors moving onto cel shading. I move on to the shadows and highlights and sometimes smudge/blur those a bit to resemble the game's own shading. I usually just prefer to stop at cel shading since that's what I'd prefer but this is also pretty fun to do.
---
The image SUPERCELL doesn't want you to see.
---
got your link, this looks pretty nice, although, if you want to have your map be in game, make sure there are no one tile gaps, plus it'll make the map look less compact and nicer
---
I have a tip, I was at 580 and lost trophies down to 370 due to trying to learn to hop in ranked games, just use hoping in friendly games until you figure out the timings and that
---
you'll probably get him first week anyways cause he is "only" super rare.

I do like her textures that are currently in game, but after seeing what they've done with Colt, Shelly and Rico over time I'm always interested in what ways the brawlers are remodeled :p

I love it when some brawler is trying to laser me as Poco, then I four-shot them without them realising. At two power cubes Poco is effectively just Frank but he doesn't stop moving. 1150 damage. Insane.

The game gives me OCD

Good question... I think 75%...

Yes it's not enough to max them out.  You also have to be able to play them. It's a problem I struggle with on several brawlers.
---
No lol, I played lol 1 or 2 times at my friend's house, that's it.
---
Hardik is a common indian name lol
---
Bringing nothing new to the argument and just repeating yourself is what I would define as a shitpost. I at least showed that other people share the same opinion. 
---
Oh no. How did you know that
---
CJ? OOOHHHHHHHHHHHHH WASSUP MY DOG! 
---
lmao, so true
---
I would definitely buy for more than stupid since I could give in tickets, please supercell add in the game she is the best so far
---
It would be interesting to have a brawler that can modify the map
---
r/murderedbywords
---
\+420, don't make me laugh. +800\*
---
For sure!!
---
ü§£ colt
---
I saw right after i posted; Dos Batmans do the grammerz?
---
Lol the team comps have it away
---
was thinking this to lol
---
holy shit why are you back again. stop with the inappropriate names
---
I wasn't repeating anything. I think you thought I was /u/ith5015 the guy who replied to you.
---
r/unexpectedaskoujia

"All we had to do was follow the dam train CJ!"
---
a Classic! XD
---
Best fanart I‚Äôve seen tbh
---
Is this a thing for kids nowadays? I'm so glad I graduated 10 years ago. 
---
Everybody else like: lol Gene's mumbling nonsense again, how cute.
---
I saw one of these like a whole year ago
---
I feel like I have to draw Thanos Primo now
---
Approxemately how many new brawlers will we Have this year 2019??? 
---
I'm sold
---
Oh sorry üòê 
---
At least it was a tie and you didn‚Äôt end up losing
---
I guess that the box automatically opened. Maybe observe any changes in ur brawler power points? The same thing has happened to me before
---
I maxed Colt a long time ago. Decided to play siege with him. He is now rank 20 and 420 trophies. I want to die. I‚Äôve dropped him into the 300s before
---
Yeah that would be nice lmao
---
Can relate, except for the star power 
---
My only qualm is that el primo looks tiny af.
---
Not really, there are lots of teamers and you get attacks from everywhere so or i have bad luck or Im just bad
---
Last update he can reach through walls but his super deals no damage.  Although I think if he drags your butt through a wall you should take some damage.  I mean you just got pulled through an unmoveable obstacle.  
---
Yes I did. üòÖ Thus I was getting frustrated by the conversation going nowhere lol. No u, style.
---
Tell me, is what you said in the text true or did you unlock Pam from brawl box and say she just randomly got unlocked and entered your account?
---
Don't team with lieon
---
Lots of detail
---
Waste of a post not impressive 
---
Get it? Because there will always be 10 bulls in this map?
---
Realist
---
Matchmaking sucks... im a lvl 6 still under 3k and I get matched with lvl 10s, my solo showdowns are mostly shelly players, a few bulls and if im lucky one or two colts. 
---
I played siege earlier, other team dominated us im three matches, like overwhelmly, I was often by myself surviving against 3 of the enemy team, incredibly difficult. Felt like the mode was 3 vs 1, had to play 4 matches for my token
---
Brawl ball - often get no close range but whole team has strong close range and we get wrecked. Makes no sense
---
The real question is how is the cannon of the mortar able to fit in the treasure chest?
---
Overconfidence...
---
... is a slow and insidious killer
---
How is his work this good
---
Cool skin
---
But... But... I came up with Thanos Primo!
