I wasn't playing as a bot. What happened was that I was playing with my teammate and we were getting a box then it just loaded up us into a match. It probably was a bot cause I suck at the game but I'm really confused on how we got into 2 matches at once.
---
Funny i actually got mortis by opening a random box :V
---
But good luck finding them
---
Of course, feel free to! :)
---
Cherry?
---
I don‚Äôt care this is really cute. Good job on the art
---
So you loaded into game one, then you lot kicked out while your bot was still in. You guys started another one while your boots finished the first one.
---
Nerf him attack damage as much as Dyrell and make him as slow as Pam. Then lower his super to 3 seconds. Lol then he would be in par with crow. Lol
---
Too pretty for pain
---
Too ugly to live
---
Smokey is a jaded survivalist who wants nothing more than to protect the Amazon! 
---
Main attack: Stern reminder
---
Super: Wildfire
---
Health: 5420
---
The game closes instantly when I enter in to it and I'm not the only one who suffer from this problem you know in this life there are people who can't and don't have that good phone so start thinking about the and do solution for the game I just want to play like the others it hurts not to play this cool game
---
Really awesome! It would be less creepy without the eyes tho
---
I was referring to Bo lol
---
don't waste money on this game tbh
---
This is so cute

It'd also be nice if she opened her eyes.
---
Ah, my bad. I misunderstood. 
---
That‚Äôs a dope skin btw
---
Same
---
after all for me he is looking like a common brawler, if there were
---
yes, that is what theyre asking for genius...
---
I guess some salty Bull mains must have seen this post cause they down voted the post and like 2 of my replies lol.
---
But at the same time  he‚Äôs very effective against characters like barley and dynamike. 
---
can we take this time to salute the dynamike that outlasted all 5 keons
---
Yeah just my dream brawler
---
Or at least wink lol
---
What software did you use?! This is EPIC!
---
I don't think so
---
Idk
---
Weird flex but ok

No it‚Äôs the LeonosaurusüòÇ

I see you are a pvz 2 fan as well.

---
What about the bowler.
---
someone has seen
---
bravo
---
Downvoted.
---
Ya nothing to worry about, you will just get more showdown wins and 3v3 wins. No biggy
---

Dont pitty the 2 box El Primo, competition makes him stronger.
---
Yes but the in game voice was implemented before making the advertisement, otherwise they would have set the same voice
---
10/10
---
Can confirm this is an amazing feature 
---
Ok...? Cool
---
She shot him before the clip. If primo hit him even once them primo would have been given kill credit instead.
---
Yeah
---
I don't think that it's the device I'm using because other games aren't having the same problem.
---
I think this bug is so stupid, stop showing it
---
Please stop accusing me of karma farming and go like the original for Christ‚Äôs sake!! u/-snek_-

People like you stop depression!! You made this man un tilt his El Primo and making his day!

---
Jokes aside, depression isn‚Äôt a joke
---
that explains a lot of things
---
This is one of my favorite submissions, super cute!
---
Me tooüòñ
---
Could say the same about Mortis :)
---
I respect you so damn much. 
---
I feel u Bro, im exacly in the same point :/
---
He is very good only in brawl ball, if you know how to use him, and also in showdown to defeat dynamike teams
---
$739 bear paw brand shoes
---
Wtf
---
What he mean is that spike is really op before Leon came out.
---
It makes you too pretty to die in just one bite 
---
L I T E R A L L Y  U N P L A Y A B L E.
---
I‚Äôm very bad with mortis, he is the only one i haven‚Äôt brought at 500 yet
---
Simple answer i can't
---
No tickets.. new event in 5h... +20 tokens in 2h..
---
How do you check that
---
Just bad connection 
---
What an absolute madlad. I salute you.
---
LOL
---
More like when you want a brawler at all.
---
Colt and barley are my favorite parts of the picture, tell her she did a great job!
---
Piper is another bull
---
A lvl 20 penny wrote this
---
A family reunion day 1
---
Pam: COME TO MAMA
---
Jessie and Colt: *runs to mom
---
Pam: ALRIGHT MY TOOLS AINT FOR FOOLS SOMEBODY BROKE MY TURRET AND I KNOW IT WAS ONE OF YOU TWO IDIOTS
---
Colt: TOo PrEtY fOr PaIn ! *runs away
---
Jessie: *honest* I'm pretty sure it wasn't any of us
---
Pam : THEN WHO WAS IT
---
Bull :* in a bush
---
That's cool bud
---
Same here, I feel the pain of trying to rank up in showdown when you get oneshot by anyone while you can‚Äôt contest boxes. I always try to get them the win 
---
And it doesnt help out anyone else whenever you decide to be that person that goes in as Jessie,  hoping to be the boss.
---
maybe he is not from the USA and most people use whatsapp. 
---
Nope
---
How many tokens did you get
---
Yeah you only need to:
---
 obviusly dont play with randoms
---
Having him at hig level to not get 1 shot
---
Have more timing than a geometry dash player passing a extreme demon
---
And having decent phone and internet                   (in this case i didnt have a decent phone)
---
Could add some new skins in the red theme
---
Your poco skin
---
Jalapeno spike
---
a nice new red piper skin
---
maybe a new leon or frank skin?
---
1. Make it so that once you are in a radius of someone without walls blocking (unless you're a lobber), you automatically fire towards the nearest player. To stop teaming.
---
2. More trophy gains for higher brawlers in showdown!! Maybe less trophies early game for showdown.
---
3. Make a limit of how many of one brawler can be in a game to stop there being like 6 bulls in 1 game
---
4. Map changes so that tanks are less common
---
5. More maps
---
6. Make a map last shorter than 24 hours for showdown, because I get bored of the same map over and over again. Change the rotation time to 12 hours or something.
---
7. Combine event mods for example healing mushrooms and energy drink and angry robo at the same time
---
Colt looks creepy XD
---
Slt
---
Oh my...!
---
Not relevant but I‚Äôm a TF main too
---
It is funny because people freak out when I disappear and low on health. They can easily just murder me by spraying and praying but no they just let me go away lmao. 
---
28 per token, if I remember correctly.
---
Don't get to excited
---
I'm -88 trophies on Leon from 500 rn
---
Send help pls
---
 
---
* 0.0816; odd
---
* 5; number of boxes
---
* 0; number of legendary's
---
I would say between 150-250 
---
While there might not be an "I" in TEAM, there is an "I" in **SURVIVE**.
---
Well, at least the bull is in the bushes
---
I do this whenever I play leon and get to the final 2. I kill as many other Leon as I can then spare someone like Brock
---
200 or more would be great. Or maybe like a daily multiplier? Idk 
---
I find that a competent primo can be very good to have on your team to take down the big boss. Emphasis on competent though.
---
We have a hero here guys...
---
Anywhere!
---
What is happening with updates? I have noticed a few changes but the app hasn‚Äôt been updated, like i think the black borders on iPad used to be transparent. But now are solid and the names in showdown are now ??? But no actual update.
---
Scarlet Johansson is not a bad choice
---
And also an ‚ÄúEl Heeeeroooo‚Äù...

I think a fair amount of people do this from time to time. About 1 in 4 times I get to the end with a lot more powers then someone I‚Äôll do this. I also sometimes team with people playing hard to push brawlers when I‚Äôm playing on my level 1 account then help them get like 16 powers while I don‚Äôt pick up any. It‚Äôs funny because people will like spin and shoot at the powers telling me to pick them up but idc
---
Ok fair

You can never really tell with supercell games. You could live inside your modem and still have connection issues.  Just remember everyone loses to lag sometimes.

Yes yes yes yes

so everything i said there, is valid here as well. piper suck :P

You can do this with brock to!

How exactly are you viewing your own profile?

Gem Grab is honestly my least favorite mode due to randoms alone. I dont get that bad of teammates on the other modes, but it's like people turn off their brain in Gem Grab.

Yeah. Laggy servers. Litterly nobody cares. The had much more people come to their game than expected, lagging their servers up, and are tryig to adapt, but more come right when they catch up. Give it some time, and itll happen
---
disgusting
---
Epic I'd like that
---
Just checked your profile. You don‚Äôt have crow. ‚ÄúGit skooled‚Äù no u
---
I know I don't have crow, neither would I intentionally kill my friggin crow if he was 500 trophies lmao. I played with the guy or something and checked his profile and saw it so I was like hey I should post it lmao.
---
Yep. 40 trophy gap is ‚Äúunbalanced‚Äù totally...
---
It's luck based.
---
Mortis player have no right talking shit
---
I got Crow on my mini qu‚Äôen i was 1K :) hahaha
---
*gets destroyed mentally after the failed no u*
---
yeah he actually requires skill unlike bull whoa crazy right
---
I'm not saying what those people that you described did were correct but all the gamemodes you just said were team based, therefore let me teach you the best rule in brawl stars: NEVER PLAY WITH RANDOMS.
---
1. they are unreliable
---
2.  they most likely play bull, shelly, el primo etc in a gamemode thats not suitable cuz they are idiots
---
3. you cant determine the perfect team comp to ensure victory
---
4. (everything you described up there)
---
Just find good friends or clubmates and push, you can discuss strategies, team comp and more OR play solo showdown and team (its a dirty strat i know, but what choice do you really have???)
---
Wat
---
Oh I forgot they had one..
---
Nita is better...
---
This is really beautiful
---
Nothing He has the second worst stats in the game, (first being tara, however she has an awesome super thats why shes a mythic) and without his star power is completely worthless. 
---
Feels bad man
---
That nita looks cutely scary
---
also cake day
---
Why bullet bill tho
---
That true x) she can hide in corner and kill the whole team with her gun and her turret
---
 \_
---
Lol, I remember when I won because meteor fell on the enemy safe
---
Noooo wayyy ü§£
---
I dont remember the exact values, but with token doublers and surviving between 4 and 5 minutes i usually get 440 Tokens x2 = 880 so around 8 Boxes
---
Should I show that dynamike can do it too?
---
Well that ass is going to be a while
---
Upvote for you sir!
---
YEEAAAHHGG, so true
---
What if you are the bull for the bush?
---
What does this have to do with rule 5! 
---
Seem fair to me (jk)
---
He could just score like a normal person but nope
---
That's why it sucks on every Showdown map except Hot Maze... I never mentioned he was good in Showdown
---
Just rank up a brawler and get +10 
---
Look dope 
---
Good yes!!!
---
He couldn‚Äôt so he just went behind the goal for a minute strait
---
Solo showdown 
---
Nope all bots are accurate 
---
Exclusive characters to only people who pay? That's real lame.

I‚Äôm keeping my spike at 444 tooüòÇ

---
WAT?? how do you come up with something so cool?
---
Yes happened to me
---
Very cool...
---
Yep, very fun xD.
---
Btw i do It too
---
I spectated this match....
---
Seriously
---
She‚Äôs not. Frank said so
---
See Frank_Supercell Twitter
---
as a level 6 mortis who keeps facing max primos this is way too true
---
If the rewards are useless, then why is he complaining? Also, he only asked for better rewards because he wants them for himself, he didn't say anything about the lower or higher trophy players. The meaning is there, don't grind if you don't like it.
---
Same problem here. :(
---
500 ain‚Äôt an achievement with leon
---
I S E E A T R A S H C A N
---
Yo phoenix Raj is in my frnd list
---
Yeah that wont happen for sure, its good as it is now. 
---
Ofc there is a very very little p2w aspect? U can push all Brawlers to 300 Trophies at lvl 1 EASILY.
---
üòØ 
---
IS HERE! 
---
crow hard counters leon's invis tho
---
Same here ;(
---
Oh no ;_;
---
I have Bo power 10 so no 
---
Why is bull not on this list tho
---
Was it the Draw match? 
---
Bro Its possible! In playling showdown :)
---
I don't get it
---
I enjoy as well..........But now we want Barley.exe!!
---
actually i played a lot with him on the most recent heist map, getting him from ~450 to 490 then pushing in showdown to 500
---
The person closest to throwing a fit is you though...
---
i still dont have a legendary at 8k
---
because he's probably gonna get a remodel, voice, skin, and buff in next update
---
For One day, yes.
---
After 7 hours of playling, you Will burn your brain.
---
This effect Will ruin your Life as well! 
---
Please, don't play that much (or at least everyday)
---
I wanna play heist too, but i Just lose trophies cause of bad teammates
---
He‚Äôs my last 500 lol and I just meant the game was cool to finish it up
---
Hi! I had the same problem as you. I use the app you recorder. She is running fantastic. But you need to give them access after installing audio if you want to record it
---
yea thatll happen, i luckily found some good teammates and we pushed hard on that heist
---
0_o

I love the word pendejo because it‚Äôs fun to use and in English I feel like I‚Äôm calling whoever I say it to a panda ho

You're welcome :D
---
This is a Christian Server
---
Fails to search for it
---
They can make a red/blue molotov it would make ppl buy it
---
Why not 100 per brawler. It will help noobs learn to not main brawlers.
---
Also more emblems after rank 20! At 600 and 700 trophies.
---
You are sorely mistaken
---
I like it that spoke the 2nd best brawler is scared against a bull, Shelly and nita
---
TramsRule?? Is that a typo on TeamsRule??

Such a cute art style

Nah. We need more leon musk jokes. Invisible leon got booring.

thank you ;P i believe in you

the smoothness of this is super nutty
---
I saw the video when it dropped because of the bell
---
Where was this confirmed?
---
Oh that's what he says? I always thought it was 'forbeina glory' and thought it means something 
---
I got 1k after like 3 days
---
I‚Äôm starting to doubt that...judging on supercell‚Äôs lack of response these days, I don‚Äôt think they care.
---
This is the merch I want to see
---
Yep.
---
Me.
---
Colt Super Noises
---
What time zone are u?
---
It looks great and has my vote....except the loss sound seems bad...i suggest u redo it with the "draw" sound...the drww is kinda rare...and that sound is not much used....
---
This be a friendly battle 
---
In help and support,U Can ask you if you wsnt
---
Nope! But it gives you more features and stability. And the cool feature is that if you are in Beta MIUI then u will get update every week :)
---
I'm curious did u kill the bull?
---
Wait ... Do you have time in 4 hours
---
U/Frank_Supercell
---
I thought you finally earned Pam, and wanted to say GG, but it's about 1k trophies? Meanwhile I sit at 2,3k and never got her :( and some are in even worse case scenarios
---
And his super charges half of itself per person it hits, so let it fly
---
lol
---
Aw sorry man I‚Äôll be asleep by then but I can still add u
---
1. Yes. You can then unlock star powers in boxes.
---
2. No.  It deliberately gave you the perfect amount.
---
I stopped playing cr because of the lack of updates. Hopefully this one will be good
---
I got a offer like yours but with barley, and for me that was Worth it cause i mostly Play barley so i'd say its Worth if you like playing bull
---
Ouch
---
Way back before global Mortis always had his hat on as the default skin, a new update came in and remodeled Mortis and he had no hat, everyone went crazy about it as we were not used to it yet.
---
 And they also made memes about it. It was until the update before global that you can have Mortis with/without hat.
---
 And people still make memes and jokes about it to this day lol.
---
Not. Yet.
---
in how many hours do you have time
---
maybe 6 or 7 idk man
---
maybe 6 or 7 
---
How did he get a leon and still not even have 1k trophies?
---
I wasn‚Äôt trying to be messed up or anything. Like I said, it is a good idea.
---
Thay should lengthen his current dash by a block or two
---
That‚Äôs not the poit Just that you had a that high level of a dynamike When you wern‚Äôt even 10k
---
I write you in 6 hours OK?
---
 Voici mon image https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/ai5f4y/voici_mon_image/?utm_source=reddit-android
---
sure
---
Maybe you should save them up so you never run out.
---
He is saying that he lost that one game because his teammates were trash and then beat them because of that when being matched up against the same Mortis and Colt in the next game.
---
I can add you but won‚Äôt be able to play as of right now. Just message me.
---
P R I M O
---
P U N C H
---
well they said it themselves that teaming is tolerable as you have the risk of getting betrayed and also this is the reason they introduced event modifiers. Just wait until its an event modifier on showdown(preferably life leech or angry robo for little to none teaming)
---
1 cup for every player you kill 
---
This would make her even more reliant on her super than she already is. Plus, it would make her mortar overpowered. Cool idea though but i think penny needs a rework from head to toe. 
---
It needs more spawns lol
---
Wow! Is this for real?
---
Cool but el primo is way too overated
---
This issue is new and i have this issue too
---
Frank from supercell just twitted "when it will be ready"
---
yo i never had a brawler above super rare until 3.5k trophies
---
Thank you &lt;3
---
 also yeah I miss counted haha 
---
Can you explain the setting you are using? I think how to map is really matter
---
It‚Äôs fucking unplayable at high rank, everyone is teaming and just spinning in the middle waiting to kill you. Especially thrawers team, a huge cancer
---
Life leech was a good starting point but they don't even bring it there more often -.-
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
i always stop playing when i get all tokens , but i want to play more,  it's just isn't as rewarding 
---
I don't trust that bear
---
600, but just Showdown with him
---
Gotta love that there thumbnail
---
DELETE YOU SUCKER!!
---
Max Leon does 2800 not 3100
---
U mean bo mains
---
You get +10% attack/super damage and +400HP
---
Pam‚Äôs nose
---
Is very cute waifu! Thanks for redoing my skin, buddy!
---
I always spin over the body of my enemies, after killing then on Showdown
---
No offence, but you could just upload the same picture everyday to pretend that you never use him...
---
Why don‚Äôt you give us your player tag so we can verify this on brawlstats?
---
Yes
---
i got it when the game mode first came out(the game mode wasn‚Äôt as fair as it is now)
---
Alright thanks üôè
---
All at 500 or more
---
Arrrr
---
Delete this post dude!
---
Yea, I have just about all brawlers past 500 and the game starts to get stale imo 
---
I hope it will never reapper.
---
Imagine if there was one Rico there
---
in sd there are 7 out of 10 shotgunners aka bull in my eyes he needs a dmg buff and give him lifesteal on autos like 300 hp for a hit\^\^
---
Didn't liked it too much
---
6 is the magical number. Not sure but I think all of them fire six shots / shells
---
Hahahaha add "bull/shelly/leon" lol
---
:).
---
Beta player
---
Lucky you......
---
Thank God, at first I thought it costed 15-30 gems
---
Sorry my mistake
---
A peach
---
I like the idea but I think 1000 is a litle too much
---
Am i the only that never had this problem? xD lol

You are scaring me

---
That is not true in higher trophies, WHERE EVERYONE TEAMS AND DESTROYS THE SHOTGUNNERS FROM AFAR MAKING THEM 10TH PLACE. And mortis doesnt need a buff, he just has a high skill cap meaning hes hard to use, but when used properly he can be a great brawler. I got my mortis to 500 trophies easily
---
I tried but nothing work üò¢
---
I only got my first Epic brawler at 2900 trophies.
---
Today, i'm with 8.500, waiting for my first legendary.
---
I hope Thats the case then I can just keep spam buying the store Hehe. 
---
That's already a thing but only 500+ trophies with brawlers. They get reset to half of their trophies above 500 each season. For example if I had a 550 barley at the end of the season it'd reset to 525. The only thing is that there's no reward for it.
---
It doesnt matter. My point is that boxes might know what they contain the moment you get them not the moment you open them. Many other games have done this.
---
This is unbalanced matchmaking
---
No offense but you are really bad at this game if you can't get 500 trophies with maxed characters.
---
You generally get them out of boxes but sometimes there's an offer in the shop and you can get them for gems. 
---
4300 on my mini, no epic no mythic no legendary...
---
Lol I kinda am not even gonna deny it.
---
Don't forget the lag there
---
That's some OG stuff mate
---
Teaming is apart of the game. How do you fix it because mods are the best thing they‚Äôve thought of. Also, don‚Äôt bash on supercell for making skins. The people that work on skins are in a totally different department than those that would ‚Äúfix your games‚Äù

If you download blue stacks, you can play phone games on pc. It‚Äôs a little difficult, but much smoother.

Line up your shots with her to maximize ult charge, then wait to use it on as many enemies as you can. Sometimes you can‚Äôt get your ult back just from your ult itself
---
Passing to the enemy only works at extremely low levels. Once you hit about 300~350 trophies people are smart and see it coming. Passing to the enemy is one of the worst things you can do in brawl ball
---
I thought she said something like ‚Äúmy tools ain‚Äôt papoos‚Äù which in my mind is english for something like ‚Äúbad quality‚Äù.

Thats whats so dumb about being maxed out. Coins are pointless. I‚Äôm a F2P maxed player since beta aswell and I‚Äôm just looking for leon but i have over 20K gold. Literally I have no use for it now. Hopefully Supercell adds something to buy with gold soon to help out the maxed players
---
This is my first (and for now unique) epic too, wohooo! I love her

Why should they do that? The whole point is for you being hyped to get it out of a box
---
A typical war vet with no affiliation to anything. Like green or camo-ish
---
Friendly game with bots
---
Or just never play because I cant play solo 
---
what
---
Yes!
---
Leon is purposefully OP.
---
Supercell rushed Global Release even when the community brought up numerous issues with the game. This is when players could outright buy a legendary brawler. It's pretty obvious that they are using Leon to quickly cash-out on a game that wasn't completely ready for release.
---
My guess is that they were getting low on budget and/or feared prolonging global would lose most of their beta player base.
---
Some reasons that Leon WILL get nerfed is that Leon wins way too many one-on-one interactions and the lack of anticipation for an approaching Leon simply feelsbadman (at least with shotgunners, there are patches of bush that even intermediate players would know to check).
---
Also Leon allows "bad players" to not suck. There is little tech to learn to master Leon. Refer to ANY Tier List and you'll see how little maps and modes matter to a Leon player.
---
Let him dream lmao
---
If referring to my post(1000token),5 days to be exact(100 per 12h). But I think 200 will be just as fine. Thanks man!

Thanks OP, still works atm for anyone wondering. 
---
Awesome!! I love this, so simple!
---
That's what broke the game too,  but Ya I miss it
---
No way. I spin to troll people and bait them, and I think that this could get excessive. Maybe even just a nerf to your character's health for staying next to an enemy without killing them.

Boss fight is a fun gamemode but it needs a lot of tweaks in game play and economy. It's no fun getting 15 tokens only after clearing a certain levels which after you can't clear.

I used a bunch of gems to buy new brawlers and boxes. No regerts. Though I now can see why having less brawlers when not maxed would help get everyone you have leveled up faster.
---
I literally made this weeks ago
---
The range is kinda weird it‚Äôs a cone shape , shouldn‚Äôt it be more of a rectangle since it‚Äôs a headbutt , also the headbutt should do small knock back and she would have faster move speed so it probably should be a legendary ! But I love your concept 
---
It's a one-time offer. But it's there every day so I thing time&lt;value
---
Lmao I have (probably) the worst internet in the world... I could easily have 500 more trophies if I had a good internet

nice aiming bruv
---
Actually nerdy has every brawler in the game but the mythics and legendaries.
---
He has a maxed brawler, I'm not surprised.
---
Token doublers are widely considered the best bang for your buck in terms of gem prices. Event tickets are even more bang for your buck, when you buy the 60 tickets for 80 gems, but ONLY IF you can consistently earn 32 tokens each time you use a ticket.
---
Did you mean to reverse what I said, or did you just misread it? Not trying to be rude or anything, just curious because I enjoy discussions over this game‚Äôs mechanics and matchups. 
---
This is too accurate

And add an editor for custom maps then we can test them in this mode !

Like with mortis i had under 100, but i don't know if this is the reason why the matckmaking was fucked up
---
it's so powerfull on this map (and also on the full bush bounty map)
---
Haha, sneaky sneaky! 
---
My point is that if Leon and Piper are played by equally skilled players, Leon will win every time. Just because Piper *can* beat Leon based on a large skill gap doesn't mean that Leon doesn't counter Piper. 
---
It‚Äôs not optimized for X. Probably in the next update maybe ? Have the same issue on iPad. 
---
The bonus items don‚Äôt affect legendary chances. Only pulling new brawlers does 
---
And then if anyone says he doesn't, or that he actually needs something more complicated than that done to him, etc, they get downvoted through the floor, ensuring that no dissenting opinion is allowed.
---
It‚Äôs only worth it to buy the level deals honestly, anything else is a waste imo. Also only use your gems for token multipliers, unless you reallyyyyy want a certain brawler. Then save them and wait for the brawler to be in the shop 
---

Nice concept, but can we please stop making thrower maps.
---
I feel personally attacked for my luck 
---
Git gud 
---
I have been playing since the android update and   collected all star tokens and keys everyday.
---
So it doesn‚Äôt add any tactical advantage, just is a ‚Äúhaha‚Äù thing.
---
I think they start off as $5 and up to $20 when you‚Äôre lvl 35 iirc

And 3 gems...

I'm only playing with randos so that glitch isn't even applicable, even if I freeze a giant boss other players will simply rush and agro it!

Bull bush camping and jumping out is the best part

KKKKKKKKK

idk why but i rly like this map
---
‚ÄòTwas a thing of beauty. But that was also before Brawl Ball
---
Would love to play on this map
---
Well, when you are maxed all you get from boxes is gold so....
---
Lmao at odd hours I sometime match with 300-400 people with 600+ showdown brawlers, if it takes too long they'll just put any fucking dude in ur game
---
Well ok the clothes are not very accurate within timeframe. But doesnt mean the char isn't. They probably made clothes more modern because of of this game animations are colorful and all if clothes were 100% acurate they wouldn't be much nice probably almost all clothes would be beige and brow and well some old clothes desings were not that beatiful. So probably they try to mix old west with more modern stuff.  
---
Another one that doesnt fit old west is brook the guy has a rocket launcher lol... 
---
Personaly I like very much this game desing. 
---
It lowers chances across the board
---
That's why you use walls to your advantage
---
no because if you‚Äôre maxed and you‚Äôre smart you save up boxes for future brawlers
---
If you are playing mortis to counter throwers and snipers and get matched up against a bull... 
---
it is just GG,
---
Brawlers get countered by others in this game, so it is just RNG. 
---
That‚Äôs me üòÇ
---
I‚Äôm a beta player and I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm having just as much fun as the global players. Having played the game for a long time doesn‚Äôt mean we can‚Äôt have as much fun. On the contrary, I enjoy Brawl Stars since I remember all the fond memories I have of things like the September 2017 update. I‚Äôm more attached to it. If you don‚Äôt care about beta, that‚Äôs fine. But there‚Äôs not some downside to being a beta player as opposed to starting at global.

At least if they put some type of cap that garantee u are going to have a new brawler, i dont know, when u open 1k boxes... but with this percent only increasing so low is a little bit frustating. Guess the frustation is the type to make people to spend, but in my opini√≥n this is a really dishonest way to make money :/

How does one make a map?

countering leon purely relies on luck (either bad opponent or you happen to be in a bush before he sees you)
---
No
---
At low levels yeah 
---
No he has said it for a while
---
Actually even at high levels kinda lmao
---
Wow really nice map would love fo see it ingame
---
Well there is a "U" wall his shoots will bounce a lot. Specially his super and his super do piercing dmg
---
I don't play Leon a whole lot, but I find if you play any brawler right around Leon you can counter him.
---
I think all of those chances percents are fake and Irrelevant
---
I got a Tara and Frank at 800
---
Hahah yeah I know I am a part of the 'problem'. And I don't really care about these posts, since they usually are in fact true. Yet it surpasses it's goal of giving feedback to the developers and it turns into sh*tty memes about some commonly shared opinion.
---
Mortis is a mortician 
---
But he can‚Äôt be too fast and the light would have to have a travel time, which makes no sense.
---
Well the people that would troll in casual are the people that NOW troll in ranked. Making a casual mode would get the trolls out of ranked
---
IMO this should be a toggle to either have it enabled or not, But its only visible for a few seconds after your last health modification (damage or heal), or perhaps whenever your health is below X%. You only really need it during intense fights.

---
It looks really nice with that minimap graphics, makes me think of old SNES games. I don‚Äôt think it would play very well, though. Too many obstacles makes it frustrating to move around, or trying to shoot at something.
---
I would be really impressed if you could create a map that looks cute as this one, but that would also be a blast to play! :) With some modifications, I think it would be possible.
---
no u
---
That would be too difficult to score and to easy to take the ball from the enemy
---
I like to push my barley in showdown so I don't get random s
---
Yes, easy to counter with spike, crow, Brock, shelly, piper and high skilled Jessie. I‚Äôm at 11200 trophies right now and if I don‚Äôt play slow and careful I get killed 2 shot by almost any brawler. 
---
If less f2p start playing on ladder you will be matched against players with higher level cards since the underlevelled  are playing 2v2s, stop shittalking about me and my position in the game since i didn't attack you in the first place.
---
Also what stats?, what the fuck is the argument about f2p games?

If only my matches were this fair. Most of mine are me versus power 10 pam

I don't have leon but I love to do that with poco

Just read the Numbers ;p

booo

Your logical fallacy's are insane. Pirating doesn't compare...

Unfair? Sure. Do you think it's unfair people can buy maxed accounts in no time? Compared to everyone else who has to play tons of matches and wait?

Like I said, take a logics class, kid.

I got in showdown 1st 1st 1st 1st and than i started losing and in the end i played like 2 hours but i actually lost trophies

No I‚Äôm chill in my current clan lol, Nova Ash. Thanks though

This post is so trippy

That only happens in noobville. At the higher trophies, you don't see them.
---
oh god oh fuck

Omg thank you. I keep getting people arguing with me ‚Äúhearthstone esports is real, the game takes skill!‚Äù No it doesn‚Äôt, if u get the right draw you can easily beat the best player in the world
---
Spike is the new Jesus 
---
Brawl Boxes arent that good anyway. The ones who can get 4k tokens are probably players who are close to maxing out, therefore unable to get much from brawl boxes except tickets and gems.
---
Don't let yourself be surrounded.
---
Leon is the best brawler in the game by far atm
---
If you mention Crow is fine the way he is, you get downvoted.
---
Why do you think there are so many Poco‚Äôs that end up as Star Player?
---
Yes it is. It's an exploit, just like this.
---
You got Mortis in 1k trophy

It‚Äôd be lit if we could buy skins with gold

no that's Leon obviously

Bro this skin is insane

I got. the  Level 25 offer (3Megas and 250gems for 11‚Ç¨) now I have all rares and super rares and a epic(Piper) from a Special offer for me this was good value

At 400+ trophies for a brawler he is more common in showdown than bull and Shelly

When you somehow get out of a match before it ends, you don't get any trophies.
---
Like for 3x3.
---
When you get out of the match, you turn into a Bot.
---
If your teammates still win, you shouldn't get trophies, because you don't deserve after getting out of the match.
---
But I think for Solo Showdown this shouldn't happen
---
Best skin idea since a while, because it doesn‚Äôt steal an idea from somewhere else
---
Wowzers it‚Äôs without a doubt Leon the legendary brawler! Unmistakable and not a cheap photoshop!

Hmmmmmmm

That would be cool but they couldnt cuz of copyright:(

He‚Äôs good in brawl ball and some bounty maps. In brawl ball you just gotta wait with the ball until you see an opening. In heist you have to target low health brawlers.
---
This is terrible.. but congrats !! 
---
I hate the fact that nobody understands that yes we want causal, but we want a casual where everyone tries... If you want to just dick around in a video games, there are specific games meant to be played super casually and to dock around in. Personally, I‚Äôm competitive games that offer a casual mode (CsGo) I use casual mode or non comp mode to warm up, practice and whatnot. Casual Brawlstars would be awesome, but not if most games are filled with trolls.

Not exactly rare, but still cool when it happens!

Yes, definitely. It'll save you a lot of time opening boxes. 500 good are easy to get, 250 PP are not.

Better off buying the token doubler and waiting for the next event.
---
Oh no i got offended
---
I hope we get an update this week! But of course supercell would probably do a hotfix or something along those lines :(
---
No... casual does not mean trolling at all. It means playing chill and or trying out new things you wouldn‚Äôt consider ‚Äúcompetitive‚Äù there are games where you can dick around, even if brawlstars has a casual mode, it‚Äôs not for trolling... in brawlstars you play to win, if it‚Äôs casual then you still play to win, you‚Äôre just not trying so hard or using meta/comfortable brawlers. Go play sims or something if you just wanna mess around dude.
---
Throw warning shots because if the colt is bad he won't be able to laser you or he'll just back up
---
i agree with you 
---
no u 
---
Android launch is June 2018
---
Actually I prefer just a little spread rate reduce and a  flat damage nerf.Darryl is pure example why bulls effective range just doesn't work well with close range assassins,because most of the times you are way too squishy too face tanks at close range or get close to ppl without your ult.
---
I saw it too üëÄ
---
Really love the setting of this map, cool lake town.
---
It can be really hard to battle on 1 block walkways so I‚Äôd suggest making those a bit bigger. Also, are there a lot of bones that block your path strewn about? I like how it puts a barely between the center of the map though, I could see the center routes changing throughout a game. Cool stuff.

What a great map!

I know right?

I agree
---
I mean everyone knows he needs a buff lmao he's a joke rn
---
Matchmaking isn't based on total trophy count but by the individual brawler..
---
It's hard to factor everything in such as trophy count and power level while still keeping the que times low which is why you may face higher trophy counts sometimes. They seem to prefer quicker que times but the algorithm does try and match you based on your brawler trophies.
---
If it stars factoring in too much you may have much bigger que times.
---
Either way, you were off about it being by total trophies.
---
Damn you lose a lot lol. 1000 wins and 3000 trophies?
---
they should just decrease the necessary to open a big box
---
Learn to counter it.
---
I use Colt to fire at the bushes and kill them bulls.

Also, kill them before they get strong.

He isn't invencible of course. But he is too strong, just because some people knows how to counter him, doesn't mean he don't need a nerf,
---
 if that was the logic, we would never buff or nerf a brawler...

chill, that's a budist sign /s

Bull is too strong as it is :(

Go to shop and click on mega box. Click the ‚Äúi‚Äù on top left corner.
---
A couple major problems
---
1) Dynamike OP, just jump over wall. This would also be really pay2win if you don‚Äôt have his star power
---
2) Some brawlers charge super faster then others
---
3) not all brawlers super can break wall
---
4) Not all brawlers world be viable 
---

Of you are maxed there is no point in opening them, so you have to save them til a new brawler comes out
