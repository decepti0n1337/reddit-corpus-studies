Supercell abri 50 cajas y no me aparecio nada de brawler

---
Lmao The comment tho 🤣
---
Good skin idea but you can’t link in the title
---
You just press try and swipe to the shiba Nita skin at the same time
---
Woah 😂
---
Moments before disaster

80% of getting a rare brawler lol

---
Thanks ! I noticed it but it was the only way to put him I think...
---
 Cashiers confirmed

do you know what women are? here is what they look like if you forgot https://freeformapps.blob.core.windows.net/showms/shadowhunters/2015/282/2c46a2da-fd0b-4f98-8823-3bb851a375b0.JPG https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/content/dam/kids/photos/articles/Other%20Explore%20Photos/R-Z/Super%20Snakes/Snakes-fangs.ngsversion.1413818001976.adapt.1900.1.jpg https://list25.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/most-terrifying-demons.jpg

What
---
This is one of the best skins I have ever seen in my entire life! I even decided to have Brawl Stars take a look at this and they said to me that they would add it into the game in the future.
---
I did too haha
---
I don't know if it's a joke, but he didn't this
---
male shelly lol
---
repost and stolen
---
Probably because of projectile range and super
---
Nice 👌 I hate getting brawlers to 500 trophies because I’m forced to use other brawlers instead of my favorties
---
On tonight's episode of "Supercell give me free shit"
---
Very good
---
little boi spike
---
This is so cool! You never cease to amaze me.
---
Needs some work but not like I could do better. Not bad.
---
She is still very strong and easily top 5 but she is no longer #1.
---

---
For me the new top 5 are probably Crow, Spike, Pam, Brock, Leon
---
Yep
---
When are you going to get hired or art work for Supercell?
---
It's the way she bends her head down. She kinda looks like a chicken doing that.
---
because there are no darker skinned females other than her lol
---
Why the hell are you starting a mini when you are at 5k on your main????
---
Its a curse and a curse.
---
Lol
---
Deal with it loser😶😎
---
Have u been playing for 8 months?
---
That's a fair argument, but this is a team mode.  So a lot of that depends on what your teammates are doing.  It certainly has drawbacks to it no don't.  But once dynamike is on Ike, it should be a win.  This is just might experience with him at 7,500 trophies.  You maybe higher or lower and may have a different experience.  It's just so easy to hit all the enemies when they are throwing themselves in front of the robot, especially when the bot is on Ike.  You can hit all 3 enemies pretty easily and ones you start throwing his tnt barrels it's gg cause they will basically start stacking.   This is obviously predicted on getting enough bolts to begin with which can be difficult on certain maps without much cover.  But if you do get the bot first you can pretty much win on the first push easy.
---
Publicly outing him might help discouraging him from stealing less iconic/popular material in the future
---
Supercell did say that they improved matchmaking in the new update... But it has become worse for me.
---
Actually, I have 14 500+ brawlers
---
Nostalgia
---
Pictures taken before disaster
---
I’ve been playing since global launch, started out playing maybe 20-30 hours a week and now I prolly play 10-15 hours a week, got 19 brawlers.
---
Did you make this?
---
u/GEDI-KOR you need to put your watermark all over your work
---
Makes sense if its a close game and they have 9 gems
---
No
---
Wow , thank you!
---
Sorry wrong person. Thought you were someone else my bad
---
it does also decrease it 
---
you have to be lucky
---
You're just jealous because he has 2 working weiners and you don't have any.
---
This looks really messed up, but great job!
---
Rip everyone's trophies who aren't throwers. I hate thrower teaming and I've made a vow to never do it.
---
lol he blurred out the watermark on the right of the drawing 😂
---
He doesnt made that i have it from a gfx pack so...
---
What exactly are you saving up for? Do you just save up nonstop and then when a new Brawler comes you open Boxes until you get it and start saving up again?
---

But still good close range brawlers tho

Did you kill yourself in the end because the 9 kills don’t add up lol

But still good close range brawlers

Jesus the remodels were amazing they used to look ugly

Wait how do you do that?

10 times more goodies cost 80 gems (mega box)  so 250 is fine for 30-35 times more goodies

FUCK FUCK FUCK GOD DAMMIT EVERY TIME A FUCKING SPELLING ERROR

I agree with all except Rico, I think he’s in a good place rn, but Mortis def needs a buff and I like your ss idea
---
Are you kidding? Why are you feeding the troll? This isn’t an infamous scandal. This is a troll making one post and getting downvoted into oblivion.   
---
Thanks for maintaining his legacy though, I’m sure he would thank you.
---
Should be every 1k trophies (replaced by mega box)
---
And they say NO
---
Totally true
---
I thought this was a joke, but I just checked it and well yeah, saw people kept trying to team. On the bright side, they kept getting killed, so I watched someone attempt to team and then get squashed. 10/10 will watch again
---
Yes I see what ur saying but u dont see a lot of the brawlers I posted above that much and it could increase them
---
I tried that in the training cave, using even mortis he will still hit like 6or7/10 shots
---
Im calling the cops

I feel like it will be the same 4-5 maps in rotation though
---
Nevermind.
---
Just a 0.02% damage buff will increase her level 8 damage to 1001 damage. Shouldn't affect her other stats that much since its its only 2 damage. Maybe some interactions may be different with 2 extra damage
---
Thanks
---

---
That was some shitty Dynamike. A bad toss for his super, and then a terrible toss from your platform launch.
---
All brawlers need a swing you can't change something like that, simply because you don't  like it, the game would be shit and the meta would be broken without a swing.

Brawl stars has not even released Rosa but our legends found a skin but what is the use of it supercell is dumb as hell to understand this. You make many skins but supercell release dumb skin like night witch mortis. But the skin is damn cool.

Happened to my frank, except the highest peak was higher and the tilt went lower. Still pretty annyoing, your tilt

But then everything will be so easy to max out.. the game doesn’t have too much need for buyable stuff like that. I think it needs more things that cost gold and more items to unlock from the chests.

Kind of like you need reasons besides he’s good in various game modes. It’s what you say against what I say. Biases. My reasons are clearly stated in the last three balance changes. Your reasons are personal experiences in various game modes.
---
Yeah bro :^) its exciting. Also commented on your post. I'm not claiming your credit. Chill.
---
Just having the look won’t do it though. A lot of time goes into animating the skins and their interactions, its not just as easy as you may think

Doesnt u derstand what it says..

Likes it anyway

That ain’t Cavern Churn, that’d be straight up pinball

Can you only view replays if the brawler you were using is 400+ ?

If you watched Maya the Dog, you'll saw her eating Cromchers ASMR.

*Cyka blyat
---
You clearly haven’t played since launch. He was op. He was nerfed to balance. Since then two more extreme nerfs for him. It’s not just one second less invisibility, it’s the constant nerf to him every update because people cry about him who don’t have him. Yet there are “rare” or “super rare” brawlers who are intrinsically better all around than a so called legendary. What’s the point in brawler rarity if it doesn’t mean shit.
---
Agree, but that probably goes against everything they believe in. *because money*

Thanks! :)

Why are you using your friend's art? It looks really good though!

We do, but the chance of encountering one of us is lower than your legendary chance.
---
They didn’t need to nerf him again. The first dmg nerf I understand. Then they increased the number of hits he needed to generate super. Then the most recent was decreasing his super. Next update they will make him throw one LESS  ninja star.
---
This is sick, i love it 😍
---
There is one constant. You. The enemy team sometimes gets bad teamates too. So why are you blaming everything else but yourself?
---
Yes, i feel like you can't run away from him and his dps is somewhat high. But i don't have him.

First off what is your damn problem? Secondly my crow is back up right now, at 517 trophies
---
Just for the troll;]
---
They have more people crying that he needs a nerf. Hence the latest crow buff solely on “if we get 1mil subscribers we will buff crow”. Boom they buffed crow. It’s popular opinion that Leon is op. Even tho he has received nothing but nerfed since his release date. The simple purpose of my post is stating that he doesn’t feel legendary anymore because of the constant nerfs to him.
---
&gt;No I mean here. I have seen it happen like 3 or 4 times
---
Then that's gonna be unlikely. Good luck on that though!
---
Make him thicker
---
Nita: I need Bear stacking
---
Penny: Turret stacking
---
Pam: Heal station stacking

.

Shelly: super stacking

Cuz I’m really good at this game...

How about making a valid argument about why Mortis needs a buff or refiting my points? Your case seems weak right now.
---
I feel like Piper is way easier to play than other snipers, but i don't have her yet 🤷‍♂️

This will go on forever tbh

agree
---
Removed - This is an English speaking subreddit, characters not in the English language have been detected in your title. This may have been caused by emojis.
---
Different rarities should come with different abilities being better than others but requiring more skill/patience to use. Leon is too squishy for not doing enough dmg at range and his close range isn’t strong enough to kill a Shelly anymore without being one shot. Plus now not being able to actually use his super to sneak for less time makes him that much more difficult to gank. He’s not an assassin anymore.
---
&gt;Cuz I’m really good at this game...
---
Good people don't lose that much. Also, how do you even know that. Everyone thinks that, even noobs.
---
This. His dps looks massive even at long range, this character make no sense.
---
Same when u are playing rank 15 crow and its not even power 6
---
Do you pronounce his name jedi or gedi?
---
Maybe you would mąkę your onw skins and not steal ideas from GEDI-KOR you and say that you did it you fucking kid
---
How can I make custom games like this?
---
maybe because i suck with Shelly
---
Shelly can destroy any wall what do you mean?? How is that not a unique ability. Not every brawler can blow up a wall and destroy an enemy with one super. Plus her sp slows significantly. I can consider that pretty damn unique. Leon is invisible and the enemy can see him within like three tiles. You can easily predict a Leon sneaking up on you.
---
Next skin idea - executioner carl or nurse pam
---
You can just buy her with gems
---
And take power points from the boxes
---
How is that
---
Since Minecart Madness is in rotation,I wonder if then next Monday will have more cart maps.

I've calculated you have about 50% chances to get her with 32 drops (29 boxes + 1 big box \* 3)
---
This made my day.
---
That must have been frustrating for them. Explains why other posts have complainers lol.
---
Ikr Im currently at 3.5k but I dont wanna look for ppl above 4/5k+ cause then they wont play with me cause im to low and bad for them u know
---
Yes I do agree that throwers are beyond broken in this game mode but no it’s not a terrible gimmick. Push up on the map and stop playing passive, if you don’t control middle you will lose the game, especially if you can’t keep that barley or dyna pushed back.
---
You unlocked shelly

haha i get it witch hunting and witch jessie hahahahahahah
---
on a serious note this guy deserves it. first he steals the skin and, doesn’t delete, but instead consciously blurs the watermark, and then, being the sociopath of a dipshit he is, shamelessly makes up a shit story and takes us for fools. he refuses to acknowledge the fact that he stole a skin and even said himself that “i myself know this skin is incredible, hence it belongs to me”, that is just blatantly telling everyone that he feels he has the right to claim anything he thinks is good. that is one big asshole move, refusing to acknowledge the creator of something and claiming their work as your own WHILE at the same time disclosing that you know that you stole it.
---
 and to darius, if you’re reading this, you’re either a) a troll who actually did a really good job at doing what you do, or b) a retarded fucking self-entitled kid who thinks that the world belongs to you. if a is the case, well keep doing what you’re doing, because it feels good to, as a community, collectively attack an individual who has done something consciously wrong. despite that it probably means you’re a sociopath in real life and a big fucking asshole. if b is the case then it’s time to fucking wake up, kid. the world does not belong to you and revolve around you. i hope some serious shit happens to you so you finally wake your fucking idea up and face the truth.

Carl: too bush thinking about the rocks in the cage.

Carl would play with some rocks

Apparently this is because on the exact center of the edge, there is a small gap in the hitbox. When auto aiming the attack is perfectly centered, so the gap will be exactly on the target, making the attack miss it's target. When aiming however, it's impossible (very difficult) to hit the target on the exact center, where the gap in the hitbox is. So when attacking at max range, aiming will be more effective than auto aiming.

You made 5 memes about teenagers on their phones late at night. No wonder you use memetic.
---
Omg 🤦‍♂️
---
First of all, 1/360 is equal to 0.027777778%. Secondly, can you explain how you got to 1/360?
---
Yea, it’s too good for a rare brawler
---
That's because he uses the uncreative names
---
Idk im not that good in english launguage cause im from finland where we dont speak english but they teach us in school so i know something
---
K
---
Exactly this. Minecarts are an awesome idea, but they in conjunction with the abundance of walls in this map makes it harder to coordinate with your teammates, making games feel like clown fiestas
---
Reeeeee
---
You should be very close for sure. I’ve got 60 small ones saves up
---
flair checks out
---
1. He's a Brawl Stars YouTuber
---
2. He gives credit where credit is due. 
---
I see nothing wrong in that.
---
It’s good but what happens when it’s the tiny circle
---
#AIYAIYAIYAIYYYY
---
pretty nice
---
As much as Angry Birds Movie
---
No because android
---
reeeee
---
курлык
---
Like 1.5
---
And when i take dynamike theres always at least a mortis chasing after me
---
#F
---
I feel you lmao
---
Currently also at 3300
---
haha he got nerfed 3 times
---
Not this shit again...
---
#STOLEN POST!
---
This is good I never get a gene nor Tara and this punished those who run away from me
---
TOP tier shitpost
---
People got to leave him alone he already learned his lesson yet he still gets hate. We should all just forget about him and leave him alone.
---
This is the worst case of "lcgab" or
---
Low Chances of Getting A Brawler a.k.a.
---
It sucks
---
Removed - DO NOT SUBMIT POSTS WITH TITLES IN ALL CAPS. CAPS LOCK IS CRUISE CONTROL FOR COOL
---
I'm scared he's speaking amazing english he didn't do that last time
---
You may aswell go back to the menu
---
Sorry for spelling mistake
---
Military dress???
---
right observation
---
r/punpatrol LET GO OF THE PUN AND PUT YOUR HANDS IN THE AIR!
---
New skin idea
---
It should mathematically be  31.25 but every 50 gems a box gets 2 box more value.
---
It would be: 34.65 boxes
---
Wait just one flipping second. Your username (or whatever that's called around these parts) is literally "removeautoaim", so this physically has to be a joke!
---
Ok. Also I do like this you did a great job
---
you can change the color of your name in the profile
---
What did he do?
---
The problem is you act like I dont knwo how to play and act superior because you've been playing for longer. I never am able to deal chip because guess what? It takes too many hits to charge her super compared to 2 to 3 hits for shelly to charge her super. By the way one of the cards deal 500 damage if you know how to play her and dont get close you can get 2 let's do some math and say you do 3k damage with all 3 attacks. Then you're out of ammo and her recharge rate is ridiculously slow. She should be able to get kills even without her super but only if  the opponent is low. Let's also mention the fa t she moves slower than other brawlers so then they can heal up and not worry about chip dmg. Crow, however has poison which prevents healing and he is fast enough to get another hit
---
 
---
Your problem is that you think that tara should only kill with her super. I can guarantee that getting the super is trouble in of itself only because of everything I've mentioned.
---
Darius
---
What's tara's spirit animal?😒
---
It means miscellaneous (Not major, only minor)
---
Tara has also just a painted eye
---
That exact same thing happened to me as a Piper with 10 gems, except that I jumped to the side so the other took the gems and we lost :’(
---
I mean, they did add boom box Brock, who knows?
---
Oh damn! I did not leave a side comment on this one.
---
But basically: No town is complete without a mortician
---
O...K so
---
He cencores gedi kors name
---
Yes sir
---
Why thank you!
---
thank you
---
Oh my god 😂
---
Ok i busy. Right now so we i get home i dont know when? Cause i just a 13 old boi
---
Darrly
---
Dude you are rocking your first day on reddit 👍
---
How can anyone have..such terrible aim.
---
xd
---
Where’s Mortis when you need him lol
---
The game was finally targeting teamers
---
Unless they start loosing people / money i dont think it will change.... this person at 8000 without leg keeps playing and maybe buy it with gems its addicting.... I got spike within the first 3 weeks btw
---
 If you know how to place yourself this never happens ...
---
Then the spectator count would disappear altogether.
---
You should type -50 with randoms
---
Yeah, sure
---
Thanks 1000 1 day only dreams
---
One breath, one shot
---
only the bot on the right can hit you
---
Exactly
---
It's just fine, so you can learn how to play against star powers and you'll become better at the game. See it as a gift 😉
---
Damn boy
---
They noticed
---
Me
---
The value would be in killing another player to harvest their power cubes. 
---
Almost got you, with a huge power cube disadvantage..wasn't a bad idea.
---
Go look at pam one
---
Hmm imagine if tara can predict the future with her cards ... that wzy we know when we die
---
☝️this
---
You guickly press try button when you’re in the middle of changing the skin to shiba Nita
---
How about we make it so on Mondays we choose the Gem Grab map, the showdown map on Tuesday, the Bounty on Wednesdays, Heist on Thursday, Brawl Ball on Friday, Ticketed event on Saturday, and Siege on Sunday?
---
Only played it once but won. It seems fun
---
Nice man! Looks great!
---
So you read the last sentence I wrote instead of reading the entire buildup that was based around misleading hitboxes and split second decisions.  In a map that's specifically designed to have these things *constantly* moving around them, there's only so much you can do to stay out of their path.
---
Once again, the map forces you to go in to specific areas based on an environment you can't control.  So you're winning/losing based on RNG as opposed to actual skill.
---
If you really want to defend this map, that's fine, but don't pretend like it's some beacon of light that Supercell needs to try and keep replicating.  Acknowledge the faults so we can have a better game with more fun maps.
---
That’s where the value doesn’t come in.
---
Nah man think I turned off since I was listening to spotify or something
---
You have all epics...
---
Your friend has no epics, or mythics...
---
Ur lucky
---
Perfect example that levels don't matter that much, nice job!
---
yea i got my crow at 0.08, and i still dont have an epic with a  0.5 percent chance??
---
Frick off
---
Frick you
---
No brawl stars-related content...
---
however bob spins in solo showdown, do NOT do that.
---
Really cool, but no-one cares and this is not brawl stars related
---
Yes thank you for the review I will think about your proposal but I want to say that this Map was conceived as open and add something will be disproportionate of course I will do as you asked but the whole map is made of the same buildings add something else will be disproportionate
---
CoC builder?
---
Don't worry he is back and ready to examine some bodies!
---
And have a drink or two from some poor guy's neck.
---
Everyone constantly lose health (proportional to base health), damaging enemies gives you half damage worth healing, killing enemies fully heals you. This mode had made people betray, so there were scarce teamers.
---
Is it sorry
---
Delete it
---
Esti roman?
---
I know but its just a Joke it get upvotes but if you want to tales seriously just not me i love to meme and joke around
---
Stop posting this
---
Never
---
yeah i like sans

It has all of that grass so you can sneak around and have spots to defend and spots to hide of you are a thrower

There were 5 matches I was star player in 3 of them, why do people like you even comment on posts like this? Really no need

Hello! I'd like to ask you if I could use your clip as a part of my compilation of Brawl Stars Highlights. I'm an editor for the Gaming Curios network. You would be credited with your name on the screen along with a link to this post. Let me know, thank you! :)
---
el primo - below 25 iq 
---
oh....
---
Be my wife man
---
Why is this a thing?
---
no one cares stop it
---
at least you habe a 420
---
Sure man no problem you can take any clips from me if you want!!
---
Add this name on screen, Primo with gems not my MlNarayana name
---
Sure
---
He's at -99 karma right now.
---
Hey Gene, looks behind you...#Mwahahahaha
---
Ok
---
I have
---
Im at 10045 trophies playing since global, and I'm just missing legendaries
---
But first give me your channel link
---
Don't be scared of the 23984 boxes to open. I've put the % of my "mini" account with 2 legendaries and very low luck value. In my normal account with only 1 and very high luck value my % is the same as mythics.
---
*exclamations in alehehalew
---
That would imply that the randoms are removing -50 trophies which would actually mean that they’re making op win more.
---
Me with 13 brawl-boxes: OHHH YEAH
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Also me looking at yours: HMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM

Check out my calculator:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/bgh7i3/chances\_calculator/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/bgh7i3/chances_calculator/)
---
already been said in DevAMA, they could go left to roght or shoot to a wall
---
Yeah the game has gotten much better
---
....weeell...
---
Dude you made me actually take over 10 seconds of my time to search the website to find out it isn't even real... :\\
---
How old is he?
---
You played your first time gem grab?
---
Dude this is very nice!
---
Yeah fuck shelly
---
I play mostly in between classes alone. Not trying to go pro just dont want to lose games instantly because people try to play the system.
---
Rule 5 low effort post will get removed
---
And now I’ve gone and quit the game
---
So? It's still unfair that you can just die to him without any change of fighting back or even knowing that he exists
---
And make it so you can’t get caught on it so you take 2000, 2000, 2000 until you die
---
i like your idea :))
---
Why?
---
9675
---
You need to learn how to counter him
---
Sure thing man, you have my permission
---
Fun Fact: If you search [SaveCrow.com](https://SaveCrow.com) you will be redirected into a russian website (idk what is it)
---
Can’t even see what’s going on.
---
You should post this on r/barleygang . Good job though!
---
I do. I dont die much to him im saying hes strong
---
Maybe because its very RARE brawler
---
She’s rare, like el primo or Poco
---
I hate siege but I don’t think it should be replaced.
---
Every game mode can be on Brawl TV. I only haven't seen heist yet.
---
Welcome to reddit.
---
Awsome!
---
AMAZING!!! Please do primo next!! He will look awesome and hella cute! Thanks in advance and keep going, you are doing great mate!
---
Pam and piper are epic
---
Look at rule 5
---
Like my map
---
It's a glitch in the matrix
---
One of my friends got 2 in one hour now that's broken
---
Thrower teams is that you ?
---
Piper map😂
---
720p
---
Probabilly this summer
---
Just look at rule 5
---
this desevers to have 9.5k
---
Ogre in my swamp
---
Looks great!
---
cuz we gat "savefrom" video downloading service from yt and others
---
Not secret anymore can do too now
---
I play with people with more than 400 throphies but me I had just 150tr !
---
Not secret anymore u cant do it too
---
Worth more than 200 upvotes in 2hrs
---
I get where your coming from, but Shelly is honestly kind of underpowered. She is good in some maps but overall she's just average.
---
You must be an El Primo
---
I know
---
What is the bug?
---
Omg that’s great!
---
You could have just posted a screenshot of the end screen...
---
Incredible work
---
But if it has 555 likes it will stay
---
This meme is when someone is convincing someone, like “when your friend says there’s gonna be pizza rolls at the party.” Rico saying a line that doesn’t fit the scenario has to correlation to this meme.
---
Wow i was thought it was a blender sculpt art
---
I did
---
Interesting
---
Of course, as long as I'm credited, you can use my clip
---
That's good!
---
Deliberate loss
---
An apology on reddit is a first! We’ve all made bad comments, no worries. I’m stuck at 5,700 ish trophies 9k is impressive.
---
team rico
---
Yes but I do what I want to do ! No ?
---
#H A C K E R M A N
---
I don't think this is a bug, it's because Rosa punches left-right-left, which makes the projectiles slightly different. Primo also does the same, he doesn't punch with one hand but alternates between left and right, which makes his hits very easy to dodge if you rotate around him
---
Hair crow honestly
---
sir..spare some legendary, spare some sir i only had 2 mystic but none from legendary i want play spike so bad
---
How are they psychotic?
---
PERFECT
---
Stop trolling u aint 13. 13 yr olds dont speak like 4 yr olds
---
you are just unlucky
---
Exactly lol. These dudes are crazy
---
No, you are just very unlucky. Your chance must be very high at this point. Ever thought about buying one?
---
And how do robots drink?
---
This looks better than the one from the game you are a true artist
---
He’s not strong lol. Idk why you guys have this mindset
---
I'm crying this can't be real lmao
---
I can't afford it
---
Hater  (i am 13)
---
What if bob is... A TEAMER?!?!?!
---
WoW, I really like them! Keep it up! 🔥😊
---
Total Drama All-Stars?
---
that spike is bald
---
Че не так то?
---
Prikolbna
---
15 and I beat all you plebs
---
Too many bushes, I can’t say anything else because of the quality.
---
Really great 👍
---
True I’ll tell him that
---
I’d rather have 2 mythics then one leggie🤷🏼‍♂️
---
Lol i am that barley
---
your wish is my command
---
I’m just scrolling through these novels of arguments, since I have nothing better to do...
---
Lol Mortis marying himself
---
You being trash with him doesn’t make him a bad brawler
---
It is to big of a map just saying
---
what about rosa
---
You’re deleting the game because you don’t like/ are not good a playing one brawler?
---
Why did Leon cheat on Nita? They were so cute.
---
Here is the map!!
---
https://crux.page.link/mRLo
---
I tottaly agree with you but there are not that many players who are good with him.
---
If you say so
---
Woh!
---
This is beyond illegal
---
And there is no need for insults
---
r/brawlmaps
---
Thank you
---
Bob spins too much though
---
Do as you please
---
Ew too much clutter
---
So did you win?
---
No problem
---
Wim Bim here comes Pim
---
Thumpnail lmao
---
Would’ve upvotes if you didn’t beg for them
---
#R A A A A A
---
In general teaming ain't funny. And ur right about the Mortis thing
---
Hello, my name is Haboub, and I contact you today to see with you is it possible to fix the algorithme of chance to have a legendary. I unlock all the brawlers and their power point and I have 0.1584% to have a legendary but I had nothing even star power I have 5 to unlock for 3 months now and nothing unlocked ...
---
I wish you a good day.
---
Sincerely,
---
Rami, Hbaieb "Haboub"
---
Wow it looks like you are holding a HD versions of Rosa in game
---
Nigga how carl suppose to eat someting
---
Forget KFC, we having MFC tonight. Minecart Fried Crow.
---
Oh I’m already subscribed. You guys have used a clip from me in your latest video
---
But the disadvantage for everyone.
---
Whats the point of invisibility then? If you see random footprints then obviously its leon.
---
Have you tried it?
---
Is a gym leader
---
All he has to do walk walk in circles around primo and cut his damage in half. Same with Pam and colt etc. Only shotgunners can outburst a decent Leon
---
But if you're in a firefight or even looking at somebody else you wouldn't even see him
---
It’s a user flair. Add it under community settings.
---
1. Go to the home page of r/brawlstars
---
2. Tap on the 3 dots in the top right corner
---
3. Tap "change user flair"
---
4. Pick the one you want
---
5. Tap "apply"
---
Jessie is OP, what?
---
Wrong
---
They get millions of views with those shitty thumbnails
---
Don't pay for anything. Save your gems on special brawler or box offers. You'll sooner or later get a new brawler
---
Go to the main sub reddit page, click the three dots on the right and click “Change user flair.”
---
Just Meteor Shower on every Throwers map - no dynagangs.
---
What’s your leg chance at because if it’s lower than 0.2% then you probably would probably play too much after your tokens exhaust. If it’s over 0.3% and you don’t have an epic your super unlucky bro
---
Thank you! Noted.
---
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt5A9Y-b_TnvG6SKYpcPu3g/videos
---
Sure thing, I don’t mind you using the clip
---
Darryl.
---
Shouldn't Leon have four?
---
Ikr
---
You don't even know how many times that mf killed me... I is really annoying, and quite frankly, I wish we could ride in the mine carts instead of die due to them
---
Idk, it still seems pretty obvious. I can't imagine how i can miss random footprints. I propose that when he uses his super and the smoke ignites it can still be seen even in a bush.
---
Don’t worry about it, colt is a high skill cap brawler.  As soon as you master landing his shots you’ll be fine.  Just lead them and try to mirror the opponent’s movements.  Please don’t complain about a brawler just because you’re bad with him.
---
Lol! I just watched your latest video 😂😂
---
You can take my clip👍
---
Either
---
1. Quit brawl stars
---
2. Stop playing showdown
---
3. Stop complaining and accept teaming as part of the game
---
4. Get skilled enough to counter teamers
---
Yeah I thought your name was similar haha. Thanks man :)
---
Of course
---
*this post was made by the tf2 gang*
---
To be honest I didn't even notice the footprints until 5k
---
Thank you!
---
Please keep an eye on our channel :)
---
How much was it?
---
i remember this movie now
---
She's Asian?
---
Not me im 15 AND a mortis main
---
Mortis is boss
---
Green so rare
---
10 minute video with probably 4 ads. Disgusting
---
*tips hat*
---
Oof my heart
---
I ship all of these except Leon X Jessie unless Nita and Leon are siblings. If they are, then I can see this. Also Penny and Daryll is odd since He is a robot but works I guess
---
gene looks happy
---
I give credit in every single post (:
---
Why
---
i disagree
---
👀
---
Leon or colt
---
Just a 1000000000post about that, nothing more
---
I agree gene could use a small but useful buff like that
---
I tried teaming twice and both times me and my "teammate" were instantly killed by Bull's Super
---
I will do it! But now I have to know what kind of wallpaper u wanna have. A Name? The Brawler?
---
I think he’s mad about double primo?
---
Bruce wouldn’t do such a thing, Leon is just a jerk!
---
😔😔
---
Are u dumb? Like literally he will become like he was first released...I hope he gets another nerf lol, he is still broken af
---
cool
---
I would rather have a button that says "hate teammates" so it's useful when the randoms use Crow and run into a bull.
---
You missed the part: Create a monopoly in a town and make the sheriff codependent to you
---
&lt;3
---
There’s a one percent chance of getting a star power so normal luck would have you get one star power per every 100 boxes
---
Yeah, I guess it is your experience.
---
Ay mortises and mikes yall gangstas till i pull one of ya into a bull or a shelly. The judgement day will come when genes will arise.
---
DENIED
---
My question isn’t the two swipes but the question of why are you playing crow like hull
---
Mortis: You call teaming a strategy?
---
Dynamike: Hey, as long as it works.
---
Shet 💔
---
Dude are you high or somethin'? Piper is definetly not a good GC. Low health brawlers and sharpshooters (Btw Piper is both) are **not** GC.
---
While she is not bad in this map, she is **definetly** not S tier.
---
If I were to adjust your list, I would bring Gene to S tier, he is one of the best brawlers to use in this map.
---
Probably. Everytime a brawler comes out, you can buy it.
---
Seems like he is in denial.
---
bull's paradise
---
By relying on predictions you have to aim your shots into the spot that you think that person is going to. So you're aiming your shots. If you're trying to make sense, you're doing the complete opposite. I know what rank 17-18 look like and I don't find the harder than rank 15. If you really think Dynamike is complicated then consider using Barley.
---
??? Lmao no
---
Ahh lol but I’ve never payed
---
I did that on purpose to show it off.
---
FaNtAsTiCo!
---
My barley and dyna are almost at the same trophy level lmao, and I do make sense, you're just too dumb to understand me. Rank 1-15 is very different from 17-20+
---
Haha! That’s also another point. I really liked this comic, keep it up 👍😊
---
Are you sure it’s not photoshop?
---
1% people who really listen the music
---
99% TIK TOK
---
I actually put gene there on accident, hes A tier
---
And i think you're ok piper shouldn't be S tier she should be at least A or B, being fragile is a problem but you need to know how to position yourself and not getting bodied by the carts, that makes her less viable than the others, but its mostly skill based and positioning
---
It’s actually a she and her name is Winnie 🥰
---
Ahhhh the beta fossil site
---
Thank you! I have a lot more planned in the future... A LOT.
---
No he has three, his minecart has one
---
