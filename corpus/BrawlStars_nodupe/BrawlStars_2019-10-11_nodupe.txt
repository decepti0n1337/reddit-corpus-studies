Not really, looks like OP put some effort into it.
---
---
---
Yeah I'm at 11k and I'm practically stuck I can only push my brawler so far till they just go back at the end of the season
---
But he just put music and lyrics
---
I have 0 clue what the fuck this is...
---
I have leggies but it is Anouilh getting star powers they are common
---
still, it has more effort than those shit meme templates where you just put text in the blank space and get ton of upvotes.
---
Guys... I‚Äôm shaking
---
True, but just cuz it's less shitty doesn't make it not shitty
---
Ofc. U meant at least i have leon i guess. And mortis.
---
Back in the 90 there was an arcade cabinet/game called 'Mad Dog McCree'; it was one of those games based on video-events; later Konami brough the 'Lethal Enforcer' series to arcade and consoles. Those pink and colored gun were it¬¥s trademark.
---
Wow Thanks! My dad said he would be home after work to take me to the park and never came back! Turned out he died in an accident at work!
---
Finally a mod that (probably) takes care of this sub and tell users what to do and what to not do.
---
No
---
OK the thing is that just yesterday I was compiling a THIRD new star, and that was what it did!! Also, once I post them, I will also be balancing my previous ones. I will make Greedy also make Gene's Super 20% easier to charge up.
---
Nice stolen post.
---
Ah ok makes sense.
---
hey
---
[deleted]
---
why not?
---
Thanks, just wondering.
---
knew somebody would ask that
---
YES! so annoying. And the ppl who collect powerpoints in the corner and forget to attack the bot, like what are you doing?
---
The sword and sheath template would have fit this meme better
---
the downvote wasn't neccesary, duh.
---
downvote? where is it?
---
Oh ok thx
---
For mortis pls

That‚Äôs why I use Leon I have his star power that‚Äôs makes him run faster so it‚Äôs not that bad for me but yeah if your using someone else goodluck
---
Same here
---
Shouldnt it be 76? since Mccree‚Äôs gun only has 6 bullets.- great art btw

Wait whats in the vid? I‚Äôm lazy lmao

---
Cool but i don't think frank needs a buff rn cuz he is already great (i won't say op).
---
Exactly!
---
Have you ever played brawl ball?
---
‚ÄúHiding‚Äù isn‚Äôt a viable option outside of showdown. In most game modes you have something you need to be doing.
---
THICCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC
---
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
---
He‚Äôs very easy to play against for good players. Then again, most players feed a lot so...
---
Lol
---
It's high
---
You're insane
---
Lucky my legendary chance when I got him was .17 now it‚Äôs .06 and I have 5 max brawlers just don‚Äôt have enough gold to max the rest still have a long way to go
---
Only occasionally in seige and brawl ball, where he‚Äôs somewhat viable, he‚Äôs a very niche gem grab brawler and besides that gets picked on in showdown, doesnt deal much damage in heist and cant defend very well, and bounty is the same case as showdown. I think that a damage buff would be fine but id really like an additional .5 tile range on his main attack. I do also have a star power idea the would potentially raise his skill cap
---
God is watching you
---
thank you!
---
*laughs in 3 legendaries*
---
oh bummer, you're not getting the luck you want from a mobile game. SERIOUS PROBLEM ALERT
---
Woah
---
Honestly it‚Äôs takedown, you really shouldn‚Äôt be shooting other people that much.
---
Yes?
---
Same, sometimes people come right beside me thinking i won't auto aim them to death
---
\^
---
Theoretically, it's impossible that all of the high trophy people lack legendaries while they all go to the low trophy players because of how the system is set up, but that doesn't stop these people from milking this karma cow "humor".
---
Being f2p has downsides like coins for instance but my brawlers i only have one mythic and its mortis
---
R.I.P. Mr. Bat
---
In some brawl ball maps you can lurk in the grass. Sometimes respawned brawlers won‚Äôt know you‚Äôre there and all of a sudden you‚Äôre stunned.
---
So how long is ‚Äúeventually‚Äù? A week? A month? A year? There‚Äôs no way to guarantee that you could pull a legendary from a box, even if the odds increase (In pitiful amounts) every so often
---
YouTube: Sh*t, I can't copyright you, yo Reddit

 You could make it faster by firing all 3 shots before rolling but well done
---
I dunno what this is about but I just wanted to post this cuz all I think about is this song when I see gene's win pose. 
---
Its fine tho, I'll admit its low qual cuz I fucked up the subtitles timing with the music.
---
I‚Äôm here before it explodes in upvotes
---
Bruh..
---
Darryl‚Äôs super is great as is
---
sicko mode
---
Yes it's good but many youtuber say need a rework
---
Push poco on brawl ball it‚Äôs easy trophies
---
Oh no
---
In my opinion magnum special is better for killing, but I would still recommend using slick boots on gamemodes where you have to travel a lot like takedown.
---
And creepy harvest after the rework
---
Thats not a point
---
Who the hell cares? Reddit steals from Instagram as well. Deal with it.
---
Frank is pretty balanced imo
---
Ooohhh the good old days
---
Wait why is it unlisted?
---
 Love it
---
Yeah Frank's super is the only thing that scares others and once people figured out Frank's not going to super because he needs the shield then they the fear will be gone
---
Yeah
---
It's the only brawl talk before the global release so they unlisted it
---
Bruh there is a category called : MEXICANS
---
What does it mean ‚Äúmade on geometry dash‚Äù?
---
I have all the legendaries but Sandy, but I bought Crow and Spike with gems.
---
Honestly this works 90% of the time. Everyone assumes you are slow and dumb, and that they can just walk up to you and kill you.
---
Brawl stars instagrammers are the scum of the earth, 90% of what you find on Instagram is stolen from reddit
---
This is underrated, I hope this reach more people
---
I see a meme template here
---
8-Bit Sheriff
---
Pam you are not alone anymore
---
The shadow is like the little brother who constantly tells on you when u try to get away with something
---
Honestly don‚Äôt mind what it is now
---
Thanks for explaining the meme peter
---
No he doesnt
---
Tick is thicc
---
What's annoying is that you're complaining on my post that I'm not spending my gold. I have 21 upgrades available, and I'm sure a few of the brawlers can upgrade twice. I'm actually being smart and using my gold for only specific brawlers. I have 5 who are maxed of power points, and am waiting for 3 star powers.
---
Can you make a legendary unlocking background?
---
Me looking at the 12 powercube shelly with super
---
Wait.. people play frank in showdown??? Pfffff we don‚Äôt talk about those people.
---
I was saying that I was just 1 gem away from a strange number, but yeah it is 10% off.
---
Yeah they're both amazing creators.
---
Its hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiigh nooon
---
I dont understand
---
I love your style
---
at the moment I dont have my laptop to work on the pack but once I get a new one I'll see if I can add that
---
You're not thinking about the fact that in brawl stars you need all brawlers max to compete in top ladder since they all count towards the players total trophies but in cr you just need a max deck at minimum to be able to compete on top ladder. Now maxing one deck is easier than maxing ur whole account on brawl stars, isnt it?
---
Geometry dash is a game, he made a meme on that games editor
---
This is some real crap right here, i just lost a b ball match tryna kill the ball carrier cause if that shadow

Oof

Right but I don't need to do that because I simply spend money lol
---
You just made me tilt my Frank üòíüòë
---
If this is real I'm gonna buy it‚Å∑
---
Shame, that would explain the black lines... Do you know who is the original artist?

Cough cough, karma-begger. Cough cough.

These are the stats for level 1. She fires both snowballs straight.
---
Hmm I might tweak her stats a bit, thank you for your feedback!üòÑ
---
Me i have 3 legendaries and complain about not getting sandy
---
I will, I just want to make the pack more "worth it" before posting about it again
---
Fix what? Supercell makes money off people that spend money on the game, if they make brawlers easy to get, there is no way for them to earn money. Just play the game, you‚Äôll get one eventually but don‚Äôt expect it to happen soon because then you will just get disappointed. Stop whining.
---
Bro I said transform the skulls in bats or kinda (I'm Italian, don't be rude thx)
---
This comment section turned into a flame war between people saying he doesn't need a buff and people that say he does.
---
Seriously you again?
---
Bruh fat things are my fetish
---
We‚Äôre all weird in our own ways; it‚Äôs what makes us unique
---
I bet all of these people are &lt;12 years old and don‚Äôt get that SuperCell can‚Äôt give everyone a legendary brawler. If brawlers aren‚Äôt hard to get, they won‚Äôt make money and I don‚Äôt want ads in this game :/.
---
Enjoy your tilt!
---
It was made by @brawlstars_j on Instagram

Sorry I don't speak Kim Jong Un

Theres so little changes but yet it looks so differant

RIP Primo player's IQ

Hope you get Leon  soon

Cool name too

Wait wat

What weird fetish are we doing this time

Doot doot your post is poop

Your post has been removed, make sure to use the body of a post to elaborate on the title.
---
I have you
---
Cries in not legendaries,no Bibi and no Tara
---
I feel bad for you i know how it feels to be ripped off especially with art but i doubt we can do much
---
like what they did with jessie they started with a small damage and super buff
---
15
---
Spike: u wot
---
That‚Äôs how they make money. Otherwise they would be eating grass.
---
he sucks at higher trophies too so that's out of equation.
---
laughs in crow
---
Exactly. Now, Jessie‚Äôs buff may seem pathetic and not shift much around in the meta, but supercell is just testing the waters and gradually buffing her (I hope) so that they won‚Äôt end up with a broken beast of a brawler.
---
Feast or famine is the best solo showdown map.
---
You can
---
I feel ya man frank has being my main since i got him and managed to get him up to 900 tr it was such a pain since i only push in solo showdown and am slowly drifting away from him he's just too weak like most brawlers counter he's just a meat bag for them which really sucks because he has one of the best mechanics in the game and arguably the most game changing super but oh well it can easily be cancel making frank just... trash...
---
Salute you fellow franku!
---
they changed it to double token event and that seems better
---
Solution = make more skins
---
Nice
---
you might wanna watermark these, so no one steals them
---
wdym you can't use ?

*Pocos Loco*

C-c-colt...?

Yeah my autocorrect changed it

it looks nice but its horrible to play

---
imagine having 3 posts in hot in less than 1 day
---
If this was actually done on GD, it looks better than most GD arts
---
Its not its actually for real
---
beautiful art
---
I imagine Shelly being betrayed by Colt, only possible if the Shelly has just used her super.
---
I legit earned my first legendary out a box where I'm thinking, yes give me the coins to upgrade shelly, brock and barley. I got 300 coins that day from a mega box out of a 1.5k star points deal. I was 4900 until I got him, opened the 5k trophies mega box and I get 180 coins which supercell says that a mega box is equivalent to 10 boxes but i legit got like 18 coins/box approx -\_- But leon is pretty good and hilarious when people just hesitate and check the bush you were just in only to see the super at their mercy
---
Your art is amazing. I'm gonna follow you, so I get to see all of it!
---
This is bullsh*t the only thing Shelly is scared of is rule 34 obssesed 13 y/o
---
Is this a u/KRNOOB alt acc? Since the art is super super good and in the same style as theirs.

Probably because the penny was playing with darryl and it matchmakers the highest trophies

Don't worry, but dang, just the piece that arguments your point I can't understand it... Could you please try to explain again? Maybe Google translate?

Aren't the star points for boxes deal still open? Can't you just open up a mega box?

Oh
---
This is the brawl stars subreddit.
---
Thx so true
---
I regretted playing for 5 hours straight. They should actually give an announcement when are they doing it so we would be more clear when to save tokens
---
I thought the same that is it so low cost
---
No he said if you scroll through the messages that he saved up 170 gems
---
◊ò
---
LOLtell him thats not real
---
OK
---
how did you know that?
---
WHAT IS THAT????
---
The bull and pam are friends
---
it‚Äôs always 29 or 39. 38 and 28 are just really crappy and unlucky gem amounts
---
Doe es ff normaal man
---
Agreed. Pirate girl is adorable.
---
I have got leg at 7k
---
buy the token doubler offer
---
Id accept it so i can upgrade my brawlers or buy star powers since i dont spend money and getting coins as f2p is... a bit hard.
---
Shut the hell up

Shut up

Colt please!
---
You are literally DOMINATING the front page of r/brawlstars right now.

Well done.

Is he high trophies? And does he have many rank 20 brawler?

Yeah before-healing damage now- damaging heal

Great concept, would love to see it in game!

Yes, he suck at brawl stars but he is very funny

It doesn‚Äôt really count ik its a joke but its kind of offensive
---
It's an ASCII Reddit gold
---
I know, i'm just sayin' that peeps with 1 week played have legendaries and i'm still salty about it.
---
So make it do 650 or 700 damage instead. 800 is just a bit too much.
---
I thought thats King primo gets more expensive
---
you can do this in 1 week..
---
Shook
---
How the hell did you play on the computer like this?
---
How much does El Rudo Primo cost now? I bought him when he was 30 gems

It doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs Bibi nor Morris who brings bats, as long as we all agree to murder Dynamike with them

Great job

Remember to watermark! So ppl won‚Äôt steal it u know

Her custom effects are not really visible in the pic sorry.. 
---
Basic attack: she shoots big bullets (with trails and other additives) 
---
Super: her robo dog shoots small bullets (leaves flare)
---
well done my hands

Awww, man, this is absolutely terrible. My grandmother struggled through this as well. Hope it gets better in future. 
---
Seriously, just wait until you get more.

Press the "reply" button on a comment

Btw i massaged supercell through helo and support and they said that they will ask the manager and also that they like my idea.
---
Too op
---
OJ would say I'mmm shakk.
---
But the problem is you cant see whats around you
---
The skin includes:
---
+ Custom effects
---
+ Custom animations
---
+ Always plays "Pizza time music" while using the skin
---
You have all the brawlers and only 6 starpowers? Dang that sucks!!

ahh yes the ol bugs bunny trick works every time

I mean kinda yeah. But hey in the end it is all luck.

Hippity hoppity dont lewd the pirate loli

Star power : 1.0489% 
---
How does yours look?
---
And I don‚Äôt like it
---
Lucky guy! I don't have any pokemons at 6300 trophies!
---
So you don't have every brawler maxed then.
---
Can you see that its a new viewing angle. It has been teased 6 months ago
---
REALLY
---
Yes yes yes yes YES
---
üëåüçïright!
---
I'm sure you will get one eventually. I actually just got mortis after this box haha
---
"oh crap he leveled up!" lmao gold
---
Hot
---
Maybe just for spectate mode...
---
1.0495% I‚Äôve only gotten 2 star powers over the last 3/4 months. I‚Äôve always had at least 3 to get, it‚Äôs just luck tbh. People are still out there with 15k trophies and no legendaries haha.
---
Ikr XD ‚Äúoh crap he used vine whip‚Äù
---
#My lord, the god of of sleep, had spoken

No. I have 6 starpowers and 20 empty starpower slots. 26 slots unlocked in total

Lmao the bibi trying to super it in right in front of the primo
---
***BIG BRAIN***
---
But if you're spectating you can use your finger to pan around the 360 degree view
---
Its only up to 12 in one box
---
If u got more than 12, then its big or mega box
---
thats why all the pams keep teaming
---
Of course it is. It is cavern churn but he made the center less campy and removed walls so long range would be an option
---
Yea but im sure how it is now its better and supercell wouldn't ad this
---

---
I bought El Rey Primo for 80 now he's 150
---
Doesnt she kinda look like she could be related to mortis with those teeth?
---
Fast reaction would go well with frank 100%
---
Also me sitting here with 7 brawlers to max out:
---
tbh I don't like both el premo skins so won't buy them
---
Drawing is very simple.
---
Once a tone is created, draw a higher tone on the border
---
Thx ü§ó for this one it took about 2 1/2 to 3 days. Comics usually take awhile due to the sketching and inking process taking so long. I‚Äôm thinking about putting out a video of me showing the time it takes me to do an illustration and a comic strip from start to finish. What do you think, should I do it?
---
At least you have crow
---
It takes 2-3 hours on average
---
*laughs in two star power nita*
---
That's why I say, the game should go diagonal
---
I bought only El Rey for 150
---
No i got 20 before in a big box and i have a screenshot for it if u don't beileve also my friend before got 23 so idk what is the max amount of gems u can get in a big box is but my theory is that the max amount of gems is 36 because the big box=3 brawl boxes so i think u have to be very lucky to get it
---
Tick and 8-Bit look like very good deal
---
Me: *puts out crocs*
---
:you're cute
---
But i fear 21 ranks ;-; cuz of his hp
---
Not trying to be rude or anything but that‚Äôs kind of ez no disrespect
---

---
Lmaooo
---
With the new brawler coming out in the Halloween update, it would be perfect for a trophy reward at 15000
---
It will probably take at least a week until we hear from the update or brawl talk
---
Everyone have 2 legs
---
nah you just got cold
---
Ah yes! Old primo...
---
i  think my new brawler fits in with mortis and frank place. you guys can make the stats yourself and i think she should be pennys sister
---
I had 200 tokens
---
#ok#
---
Omg you didnt get a leg when you were born?
---
DONT WORRY MARIO HAS 4-IQ, MARIO KNOWS TO GET A ROBOT WITH A BOMB HEAD

Ikr I rekt him completely he was totally helpless
---
Yea I'm working on getting them to 15, the ones I really like I got to 20.
---
This is big brain joke. Wouldn‚Äôt have understood but for the comment
---
Dang there needs to be a thing that costs 2 gems so my gem count can be perfect.
---
People steal anyway and remove watermarks
---
https://youtu.be/9XN57BhyZwk
---
I set this as my wall paper because I really loved Richochet, but I don't like seeing the watermark though.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/azev0i/rico_ricochet/
---
u/nemga_ is such a good artist though.
---
I use this in the poison alot lol
---
#Oho, you‚Äôre approaching me?
---
Where‚Äôs serponge
---
I‚Äôm on mobile too! You‚Äôll beat a demon eventually. I couldn‚Äôt at 700 stars. I‚Äôd recommend practicing The Nightmare, The Lightning Road, and X.
---
Clubstep is harder, but I‚Äôd try to beat that as well. 700 stars is definitely higher than a lot of players go.
---
Tick about to see what the creature of the night does at night....
---
I have a slight feeling that he sometimes might be acting worse than he actually could be. But I think most of the time it's his actual skill in the video.
---
I aproved that üëå

---
I like this artstyle! Good job!
---
Is it so difficult to answer a question?
---
I hope you make the right choice. Don't be like me, waiting 5 to 7 years to realise your friends don't actually think much of you...
---
El fondo de pantalla
---
Thats why i dont have any star powers either!
---
Thank you so much! &lt;3
---
I can't change your name without getting closer
---
OMG best frank ever
---
Thx! And I tried The Nightmare and The Lightning Road, but as I said I'm just a nub on mobile, I practiced a lot and I still can't beat neither of these. But anyway I focus on the Chaos Gauntlet, I'm trying to beat Kappaclysm
---
I can use this meme?
---
Yes :)

What mode would you normally play with a lvl 1 brawler? Itend to do best in showdown
---
Whaaaaat
---
Trust me, I was at 17.5k just sitting there doing jack all üòÇ
---
Only if he‚Äôs max
---
Clearly not so lazy that you don't make art (:
---
I set this [photo](https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/azev0i/rico_ricochet/) as my wall paper I liked it so much. I'd pay the artist to remove the watermark since I don't know how to remove it and I'm too lazy to learn.
---
Wow so pretty!
---
I'm not shaking. I am immune to it
---
Its 100% normal to get that white sticky sweat on your hands
---
I personally haven't bought the any thing but you should spend your gems on what is more important for you. Its basically skins vs progresson. 
---
The best offers are the deals of token doublers where you can get 1000 of them for less than 50 gems. NEVER use your gems to buy coins, as that is the worst deal.
---
To progress the fastest, try focous all your coins on one brawler for example shelly, and buy every offer you see for her in the shop and only upgrade her. Then once you have gotten her to power level 9, upgrade a different brawlers. This is because, once your brawler is at power level 9 you can get star powers from boxes which give your brawlers better abilities. So for example shelly, she has a starpower which allows you to instantly heal 1800 health when you drop below 40% which reloads every 20 seconds.
---
Make sure you save your gems, I personally wasted them early on and got some skins, which are cool but don't help getting progression. 
---
You can also use gems to buy brawlers but it is better to wait to get them in boxes, unless certain circumstances. You would mabye buy a brawler if like me, have every brawler except the legendaries, (super hard to get), to buy a legendary so that you don't have to wait 3 month per legendary.
---
Hopes this helps
---
You will get a legendary at that noob account for sure
---
*Goose wants to know your location*
---
So is this your style? I would call it animation art I believe...Very nice üëç
---
Looking forward to seeing your next post.
---
I enjoy this Spike very much. For these reasons I have decided to upvote it. You shall receive said upvote according to the delivery systems designed by reddit. If you do not recieve the upvote, please pm me and we can meet in person, and then I'll give you the upvote.
---
This honestly is so cute! I just love the mix of colors you used and how they perfectly compliment each other!
---
He isn't the only one
---
You reached the front page
---
Yea i can relate
---
Congratulations!
---
Why shake the screen bruh?
---
So I'm assuming you do as well?
---
Lol.. ok
---
Noice, you got gene the bean
---
You said that she needs a nerf. Of course I'm gonna think that you think she's strong. The "I'm sure I have more trophies than you" was also hilarious. How many trophies do you have?
---
1 ticket for that, lmao
---
yeah I hate this matchmaking
---
MPV, NICE
---
#im bad speaking English, sorry
---
Because they use the internet. Not your russian internet clone "inyernet".
---
You can clearly see that he is 10 years old!
---
r/ihadastroke
---
I love Penny and this is awesome
---
7500 trophies isn‚Äôt even that high
---
Looks so much better tbh
---
Really you have more trophies then us. Then tell us how many trophies you have
---
barryl
---
smh
---
*brawl star meme*
---
Ok that hurt me... it was a joke but was necesary the downvotes? üòï
---
how is that a hard choice??? Thats a definite choice
---
It's rank 25. And thanks :D
---
_knowing that you aren't the only one who plays Undertale and Brawl Stars fills you with determination_
---
The highest amount you can get in a normal is 12, so a big box could technically have 36 if you‚Äôre really lucky but that‚Äôs hard
---
r/subsifellfor
---
r/stopfallingforsubs
---
Yeah, I'd report that shit for sure. I'm 100% receiving 100+ tokens every couple of games
---
¬†‚Äç
---
**sad Darryl noises**
---
If you max bet in robot rumble and stay alive for 7 minutes...
---
Kinda sad how you pay attention so much on memes instead of actually focusing on the conversation here. All I said was that op's technically wrong and you came out of nowhere and said get your head our of your ass which still makes no sense to me. Probably another stupid, pathetic meme you use
---
r/engrish
---
12 XD i hate my life
---
It‚Äôs not stonks at all because the token doubler you get from boxes/purchased using gems doubles tokens AFTER tokens you get and the double token weekend. You don‚Äôt benefit anything token doubler wise; the only thing is probably just saving you time to finish your token doubler.
---
Thanks
---
Everyone knows about this.
---
The higher trophies you have, the lesser trophies you will be rewarded/win, and the more trophies you‚Äôll lose/loss.
---
that's rickdiculus
---
You absolutely can‚Äôt. There‚Äôs a delay between the actual game and what spectators see. We tried this to find out. I played solo and had a club mate spectate and voice chat. Everything he told me, I already knew. The only exception was where a bush camper was but I woulda figured that out because I‚Äôm not stupid and I bush camp.
---
#ONLY THE WEAK BELIEVE IN SLEEP
---
What, the hair?
---
How can OP make something so perfect...
---
True
---
oh no im so frightened that im in a fight with a fuckin‚Äô toddler. bruh this guy just wanted to show you something and you‚Äôre over here saying ‚Äúwaaa he no specify, so he wrong waaa‚Äù like dude cant you just enjoy something. the point of getting your head out of your ass is to look at something at face value, and just appreciate it for what it is. hope you learned something, peace bitches.
---
Plot twist : There are &gt;1 brawlers in the map
---
I think that 600 would be a good replacement!!
---
To much reddit for today
---
This is disturbing
---
I have crow but i want spike or leon. Why is it like that?¬ø?
---
Crow is like 8 in crow years
---
I play Mortis in heist on maps where throwers/shooters are good.
---
You would hear bonetrousle instead.
---
r/emojipatrol
---
Very cool
---
Reeee
---
Oh no, I'm a bad random!
---
He can tell you almost everything.. where the energy drink is spawning..where the robot is spawning... and most importantly tell you where the remaining players are , what brawler do they have , how many power cubes they have ...this is most helpful with maps full of bushes like cavern churn and eye of the storm and even in the gem grab map : snake pariel (not sure what the second word was)
---
Wow
---
you are a terrible player.
---
I wanna be Winston
---
Why did you get downvoted twice?
---
You‚Äôre welcome!
