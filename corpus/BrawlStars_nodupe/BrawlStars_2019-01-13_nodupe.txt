Bahaha good idea and good edit
---
Why not use the english name...if most of there losers speak english?
---

---
How many times I gotta tell y‚Äôall your using Darryl wrong. If people understood how to play him he would be one of the most op brawlers in the game. I grinded 300 trophies with him in one day.
---
I totally agree. The game would be better and would require more skill without it
---
I don‚Äôt think he needs anything. He is a perfect specimen.
---
Smash and grab, it‚Äôs the old name for gem grab and a much better one in my opinion.

I will probably make some adjustments in the near future.

I have felt this way many times but usually for the opposite team. 
---
Username checks out
---
Yea, also the only two brawlers I see 3/4 of the time are either Bull or Shelly. 
---
You're not a piece of garbage. You spend your money for what you want
---
  
---
I bought him too, and for me he's a bit too much op for now. It was way easier to push to 200 trophies than any other brawler, even without any upgrade
---
Why wouldn‚Äôt she?
---
try gimp.
---
this is the best ms paint i've ever seen so you'd probably be a god
---
There would be no need and they would have to make new servers because the Nintendo edition would be way easier to control then a phone 
---
It's random. 
---
But he doesn't tell what im looking for. thx anyway
---
Which maps? 
---
congrats my guy! I‚Äôm gonna be buying this later üòä
---
He's pretty underwhelming UNTIL you unlock his star power. 
---
If you have Brawlers maxed or have all the power points to max it those are transformes into coins. So the more Brawlers you max(or the more power points you have on brawlers to theoratically max them) the more gold you receive.
---
Fake
---
I had it too, mutliple times
---
I killed the app if my settings every time it happened and it kinda worked
---
Darryl is my favourite. I like him especially after his rework, where he builds his super faster. This change drastically changed the way he is played. In my opinion, he does not really need a buff. If he was to get one, however, I‚Äôd say to give him a slight damage buff, but that‚Äôs it!
---
There's already m+kbm players that crush
---
Looks like Clash of clans loading screen!
---
Someone already hit 18k
---
The person that you wanted to attack the +11 Shelly May have through that you guys couldn‚Äôt kill the Shelly, and rather than possibly taking 3rd place, he wanted to kill you so he would get second. 
---
8hrs?

Excuse me what
---
Who?
---
Could you use a few adjustments. But damn that‚Äôs a cool concept you got there
---
brawl ball my guy 
---
I know it‚Äôs really annoying especially when your under trophies 
---
Response hit 18.4k last season
---
A lot of you guys are saying that Darryl just requires more skill but if you look at the character based leaderboards he is consistently one of the lowest trophy amounts reached and that‚Äôs with the people who are the best at this game. For average players, especially if they don‚Äôt have his star power, Darryl is incredibly lackluster. Mortis on the other hand is probably ok for now.
---
Quick mafs

Lol yeah. Thx dude. If 1 more person gets 1K this season, we can have a 1K only sd match

A lot of top players that have YouTube or Twitch said something like "I don't like teaming, but in top level this is either you team or you lose"

And yeah teaming is not prohibited :)

I bet you‚Äôre one badass barley
---
Omg lol I played Jigsaw, KairosTimeYT, and a 600 trophy frank on brawl ball and got destroyed! Lmao

Holy hell, max could one shot most characters

He's good in showdown if you just run away

Removed - This is an English speaking subreddit, characters not in the English language have been detected in your title. This may have been caused by emojis.
---
I would have to disagree about never being scared of mortis in showdown because personally playing throwers in showdown I pray there won't be a mortis
---
Fair points though, I just think that  a buff to mortis would make him too strong on brawl ball which would mean instead of just a buff a rework would be in order. I don't really see how they could make mortis better within reason without breaking him
---
Makes no sense 
---
I get chills if i stare at it too long...
---
Cool
---
I think it's worthless,  especially when you get near a box and got bull jumping from a bush and it auto locks on the damn box if you tap it by mistake when you aim. cost me tons of matches

How much did it cost?
---
Rather than red zones it would be cool if they were white lines on the ground, just like in soccer (football if you will). They would be less intrusive and fit more thematically.
---
What's your reasoning behind making it so that when a brawler moves out of the zone they can't go back in? I feel like it could be quite frustrating when you're playing defense and need to find a spot to heal. 
---
You win
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/afe1ct/brawl_stars_fanart/?utm_source=reddit-android plz I know I won't win but can u help me try?
---
Ehh... I'd say not too long but not too quick. It usually takes them like 3-6 hours. Be patient and good things will happen
---
What are you taking damage from
---
Because you can not run off field in a real game but I guess that could be up to change ! Also the red was visual it could ( and should) be an invisible wall most likely marked by the lines like you said ! Great idea
---
Tara has been a top 5 brawler consistently throughout a couple months. I really don‚Äôt think she needs a nerf. If anything, I‚Äôve heard people call for a nerf, although I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs needed either.
---
Jajaja is funny i love it
---
Thanks for being helpful and friendly!
---
How does shooting your basic attack/super work?
---
The penny shot me b4 screen shot 
---
I should get one of these, they look amazing like you said! Upvoted.
---
The bug is the heal circle because the machine is gone and yet the circle is still healing them 
---
No problem. I'm trying to become a moderator for this subreddit by helping out with any questions and ideas people have. And I just like helping people out. I can't stand to see no one respond to a serious question on Reddit
---
Called a ‚Äúflair‚Äù on several subs. You seem new to them!
---
They should use this as the loading screen for the game tbh
---
Oh wait is was a ricochet or the pam 
---
Well, one of my friends did that because he thought gems made him powerful like in showdown.  
---
I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of people are the same.
---
Or it was the shelly
---
Leon is so easy too kill in gem grab lol and pam honestly all ya gotta do is have colt a ranged guy and bam she dead pams ass
---
killshot
---
1000 bushes later 
---
What if I told you in the game files there's a mention of a hook type brawler?
---
Something similar to your super idea might be in the game shortly
---
And also the pam doesn't have star power
---
No theres an 3ps that it looks like pubg. 
---
So it was unfair because they had infinite heal 
---
And I lost the match 
---
Phone is $900
---
Gamevice is $90
---
POWER CHORD!
---
Pam has insane dmg and health rn and she can easily kill a colt. Leon is unarguably broken rn. He has such a high dps and can beat every single brawler in a 1v1 90% of the time. Plus his super is op too
---
Didn't know spike was Asian
---
I fought like several teaming teams 
---
Your marks
---
You map any button to the screen where the attack it, in this case I have L2 for Super and R2 for Attack. If I tap it it autoshoots, if I hold it I can direct it with the wheel.
---
Major advance is not blocking the screen and not messing up doing auto when you meant super
---
Big Chungus 
---
Are the names on the left your clan mains?
---
That sounds amazing. Has your gameplay gotten better since before this?
---
I'd disagree with Mortis and Crow 
---
The image looks really polished though, well done!
---
Curious if any reasoning behind the percentages
---
Also Supercell has made a point to keep Rico's and Colt's damage the same if I'm not mistaken. I think you should add on a 5% to Colt as well as he's not great either rn

It has when moving downwards, I hated being on top in showdown because I couldn‚Äôt see going down.... now My fat fingers don‚Äôt get in the way.

Also sometimes I meant to use my super and pressed auto, with this that won‚Äôt happen.
---
It be like that now its pay to win for life

How what
---
There are multiple 1k+ trophy Mortises on the leaderboards right now. He does not need a buff.

Darryl's not bad tho

So basically it‚Äôs a ‚ÄòYes‚Äô, not a ‚ÄòNo‚Äô. It‚Äôs not an eagle-eye 3PS like BS. Can‚Äôt compare like that matey. In BS you can see what‚Äôs going on all around you. Can‚Äôt blame the game for your own lack of positioning. Of course I would be peeved, I never said I wouldn‚Äôt. And yes, it still does happen to me. But I don‚Äôt go suggesting an idea to fix something which is entirely my problem. You have a screen-full view of your surroundings. Play a bit more and you will learn that positioning is an actual skill, not an exploit
---
Good thing i did it while i could
---
Heres an idea for Bo

Instead of shooting 3 arrows he shoots four/five that add up to the amount the 3 arrows combined for. No damage increase but a nice remodel

Might put Colts gun behind the logo, don't think they want a bullet undermining their logo

Still though, this should be the new loading screen, the current one is so bland. Damned poco mains
---
If he kicks you you can join my club if you want
---
Use him wisely, super into rangers (Dyna, barley, Piper, Brock etc) you can take these down easily. And go for low health brawlers 
---
Bull + Primo + Barley = Nobody pass
---
Ive seen brawlers play outstanding the whole game, collect all gems and litteraly just walk to the other side. In those cases it is obvious they are just being dicks and doing it on purpose.
---
I would pay to be able to block people.
---
Those pipers.... smh

Why do people not open there boxes?

Ugh I hate people who say my jokes aren't funny to my face.

doesn‚Äôt Leon come default at 1k? but seriously holy shit

I like the idea, just i think that brawl stars would have to be more "involved" for the switch adaptation

I can relate to this so so hard. It's so bad I almost gave up on collecting these. Your entire time gets wasted collecting all these trophies, they're gone in mere minutes because randoms.
---
Got lucky today though, didn't lose with randoms. But I have more chance getting brawlers than getting good team mates SMH.
---
I don‚Äôt intend for this to be payed for and rather should just be a standard for any and all brawlers and should be active at all times hope this gets added into the future as it is what led me and others to stop playing clash royal

Shameless self-promotion...

well wizard barley is a default skin...

Is It sarcastic? Sorry im asperger

Y u all not listen and bully me and downvote WE NEED THIS BUG TO BE FIXED WE NEED SUPERCELL TO SEE

nah mate for real,how many for a win and how many for 2nd
---
With respect i tell you , seems a very dumb idea ... If you are on a bad streak , just take a break , changr your strategy or just play with other people , improve yourself in order to win , as simple as that
---
At lower levels, yeah, you will progress faster. But then stop doing it, as every upgrade will cost more gold
---
Quality post. What are the admins doing?

At least use new models and do something original...

How is it your problem it someone suprised you when you're in a fight? And nah its. Not eagle eyed but it can be in like spectate or on pc you can eagle eye cod tho you won't aim well bc cod is a fps, my point here isnt to argue with you its just id like to see my suggestion implanted it would make the game better in my opinion i didnt say yall had to agree wit it thats why its a suggestion

What level 
---
What is your skill level? Because if pam and Leon are broken to you, you're skill isn't that good
---
You‚Äôre supposed to use him slightly further away not all up and personal. He doesn‚Äôt need any more damage in close range.
---
I‚Äôve only got her level one but I‚Äôve gotten her gold
---
I haven‚Äôt played showdown above 600 
---
no
---
I am not saying that this would guarantee a Brawler would be all of a sudden really viable or one of the worst options. I mean it to say that the buff *could potentially* help a Brawler have at least some viability.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Most interactions would have a slight change, nothing drastically different except for (probably) Leon interactions and Mortis interactions.
---
Ricochet could potentially take another hit or two depending on its level and the opponents level in a 1v1 situation. This could make him *slightly* more viable.
---
I guess Morris is pretty good just for holding gems and being a distraction for your enemies. It‚Äôs main purpose is problably just being annoying in general
---
Oh, I get it. I thought there was some trick to getting better brawlers if you opened a bunch of chests at once. Nevermind me.

I had this teamate with playing el primo and he had 5 gems. (My other teamate had the other 5). You would have thought he would at least fall back right? No... He walked towards a brawler with 3 gems, attacked it and the el primo died. We lost the match.
---
Because apparently 10 gems aren't enough for them
---
Give them a break, they‚Äôre a business, they need money.
---
Ahhhh.. that's hot. That's hot
---
Go on a computer, visit a subreddit's page, and when you scroll down a little bit there should be a button to get a flair on the right.

Actually as a 700 mortis main I would want them to be harder to pickup. I frequently grab them when I don‚Äôt want to and that ends up wasting 1000 hp that might come clutch later.

POOF 3 campers pop out and yeah im dead 10th place -7 trophies.

Notice the lights in that picture? The people who bought Leon keep those on. If they Nerf Leon, it‚Äôll be a few weeks from now, and it won‚Äôt be that hard of a nerf.

*F B I*

Shut up and take my upvote
---
It's normal. 
---
Damn dude congrats, barley can be op. This should mean pam and leon are easily beaten by you bc your experienced. Im at 1.7K rn and i main colt at rank 14 p7.
---
I dont got high ass levels bc well all supercell games are games to pay not play üòÇüòÇ
---
But he gets the job don shelly colt or a thrower easy kill pam n leon

I hope you get banned

How much time have you pumped into this?

That‚Äôs if you have good internet and the switch has the worst lag out of the three consoles
---
I don't get it....

victory is only +2????

I hope they never nerf him

Leon cause leon.

If no leon then abuse your wallet.

Supercell luck *insane* pls nerf :)
---
Pray to the BrawlStar GODs
---
Almost all of them, Nita, Colt, Rico, Penny he‚Äôll even Jessie
---
Now the reason I can‚Äôt kill Jessie and Penny up close is because most are at 4 levels over me but idk about the others. If I‚Äôm just underleveled then oh well, nothing has changed and I‚Äôm level 4 now at 400 trophies.
---
Link to full video :- https://youtu.be/aCJjowkPDOQ
---
Lol, I didn't even know Penny was even somewhat rare. If it makes you feel any better, I had to buy my first legendary in Clash Royale and it was a darn lava hound. Will probably do the same for this game
---
I meant input lag. People already server lag like crazy in BS, but not a bad point on your part lol. 
---
How many for a loss?
---
-7
---
Your game runs so smooth... what are you using? Since the update I‚Äôve been getting bits of lag.
---
There is no definitive number of boxes you have to open in order to get a Legendary. With every Mega Box you open and don‚Äôt get a new brawler, the probability of you getting a Legendary brawler increases. If you do get a Legendary brawler from any box, that luck will drop you to zero.
---
Weird flex but ok
---
HahHhaHHhha
---
Thanks I do not have pam yet but I do have poco
---
lol, so far I've figured you need to open about 900 at my current legendary drop rate, so praying is probably the only way.
---
They did it with clash royale
---
I thought Leon threw 5 cards not 4 making his base damage max 2500 per shot and 3500 max damage max lvl
---
I have a good idea for a brawler but I don‚Äôt no if I should post it
---
So it's only mega boxes then? Also, I meant average, of course the actual number will be different.
---
I have seen this before... Stealing bad
---
*menacing stare*

This is one of my favorite ones so far! Also, I miss Ryan.

I miss cactaurs so much

I might be wrong but for me im always gaining a bit of exp here and there. Ive seen these post of max exp for the day. But i be playing different brawlers and ranking them up in trophies and when they go up a rank i usually get exp for the next few games. I havent looked out for this or tested this. Try it, it might work? again i might be wrong

Get gud

This is awesome! Well done! Also, I love the detail of the strawberries, I used to have the same one!

I know the drop rates but what I‚Äôm asking is if I can‚Äôt get a certain item from brawl boxes such as power points does that increase my chance for other items
---
It looks good!
---
Bull beats primo 
---
I find it funny/sad when they go for the 13th or 14th gem with 9hp, an suddenly the opposing team now has 25 gems for the win. Horray :/
---
Idc what ppl think =_=
---
When people say that trophies don‚Äôt mean anything, it really pisses me off. They seriously don‚Äôt get how hard it is to push when u get to 700 or more trophies on a brawler. +3 for a win and -7 for a loss means you can only lose 1/4 of your games to even have a net profit of trophies. And winning 3/4 of your games against other pros who also want to win 3/4 of their games isn‚Äôt exactly easy. Not to mention the 10 minute matchmaking time means that you have to win 90% of your matches you gain a substantial amount of trophies in a short period of time. Only consistent skill would be able to win that much at high level gameplay
---
I absolutely agree! That said, the CR team is a bit bigger if I remember correctly, and Brawl Stars just went global, so the team probably wants to focus on actually getting content out rather than just discussing it. On the other hand, Ryan is the community manager and I haven‚Äôt seen him in the community in freaking forever and I miss him. Seems like Frank is the most active team member.
---
Barley should be on the A
---
Since it's really hard to stop teaming, a good report system through replays would be gamechanging. For example you send the player's names and the replay and use some kind of timestamps, when the guy from supercell opens the replay it only shows the timestamp u sent so instead of him watching the whole thing he can just watch 3-4 seconds. In the beginning it would be hard but as soon as the first bans come then i guarantee you teaming won't be a thing because some people have spent a shitton of money and time in this game and wouldn't wanna risk it. If this would even happen though i bet there would be a unban offer of 1000 gems or sth like that.
---
and the reason is?

Self advertising? Seriously?

I really wish that this gets added to the game
---
Actually i main colt, my bull is power 1 rank 1 lol
---
And people who are less than 2000
---
True but i don't use primo or bull so ehh
---
‚Äì High DPS at close range.
---
‚Äì Good bullet spread to harass at medium range.
---
‚Äì Enough health to survive some close calls and can be gem carrier.

‚Äì Controls space very well, especially useful in gem grab, with her turret and firing range. Plus her passive ability to heal teammates. 
---
‚Äì Can be quite hard to take down in SD if used well. Not OP in bounty and brawl ball but may work in certain maps and teams.
---
How many brawlers on the roster have high dps and high health and survivability?
---
Community podcast, absolutely promoting it
---
He already got it. He‚Äôs asking if the star power is good
---
Kudos to you
---
This one is really good,not like the other created with pure photoshop from the Brawl Stars art.
---
50% is hell too much, Make it 25-30-35% And if u do that with Leon, He is quite a waste like Tanks, Everyone will just team up on him
---
Ah, the art of chain supers. Truly satisfying to slap three enemies in to spawn one by one. Ez star player
---
‚ÄúListen to this episode of my podcast...‚Äù

Barley sucks, well... he doesn‚Äôt suck but he‚Äôs not an S+ 
---
Potions
---
Idiotgaylord69lmao
---
Yeah thats true as well
---
Amen brother, enjoy it 
---
Range too short to chip enemies, but shotgun spread too wide and split into two hits that is too far apart to do enough damage up close.
---
That is not to say you cannot be good with him. He can still kill stuff when he rolls onto someone for the short stun and then whoop ass. But there are only a handful of brawlers that would even allow you to sneak up do that, while most will just kill you at range or destroy you up close.
---
That's the thing. He requires very specific situations to do an okay job. He is also the only brawler that no one goes beyond 800 trophies and that says a lot about his general performance in higher level games.
---
M at 11.3k with 19 brawlers and mine both are above 560 and I pretty damn agree with you
---
How do we attend a match? Do we physically go to a place or just do a friendly battle...?
---
Y E A H, S U R E . 
---
That was what you said in the description. This sub shouldn‚Äôt be used for advertising
---
I totally agree with you, Still according to me Bo needs a remodel and Rico really need a bit of health buff
---
You do a friendly battle. Everything is explained in the sign up link, so make sure to check it out.
---
Thanks
---
Costs $1500
---
T H I C C
---
I have seen the sign up link , but I‚Äôm still a little confused, do we have to physically go somewhere for the match? If so, we hav some difficulty since we‚Äôre school students...
---
That's good then
---
Nope, you dont have to be physically there, you just need to play friendly games from your home/wherever you want :)
---
A little tight to try and get to the mine but I like the concept 
---
Ty!
---
K thanks for the help! For how long will the tournament go on?
---
How to set ur brawler in the name in this server? O.O

Define long time and high level, you sound like every other kid who thinks he should have Leon because they played very casually a month before launch

I know someone who started with me. Literally has gotten 5 different brawlers. I'm still waiting on an epic brawler. He got Tara, piper and Frank back to back days opening boxes at 12pm.

excuse me, what is pam doing int the c tier she should be A or S because of how strong she is right now.
---
Hey can you check your inbox
---
Yea. It can be a bit frustrating getting Shelly chained when playing as a tank. But Shelly is the anti-tank bralwer and her ability to super chain makes her fit into that role better. I don't see a need for a change as I feel super chaining is one major reason why Shelly is viable. 
---
You can't see me
---
Very true. He has less hp than bull though, and it can be hard to land all 4 of his shots for max damage unless you are very close. In my opinion he's pretty ballanced, maybe a little nerf to the super so it's harder to sneak up on people out of the blue. 
---
This is so cool! What program did you use?
---
I play a lot of the nova game smite and in that game there is a character called loki which does what Leon does he goes invisible and can one shit people and this can be frustrating for new players and to an extent even veterans I think they should just re work Leon's super into something else because invisibility in any game is very annoying and can ruin the experience of. New players. I know how to play against Leon even I'm fairly new but it's still an annoying mechanic that discourages new players form Ying this game if they run into a Leon.

These are superb ideas for skins. Please supercell watch this!!!!!!!!
---
I don't know. Maybe?
---
The funniest teaming I experienced was 2 frank and 3 nitas on feast or famine. The Franks were charging supers off of one another. And the nitas would pounce on anyone that got stunned. It was like 2 guys leading a wolf pack. 
---
Lmao thanks for the tip, I got spike maybe a month or two ago and I guess I still probably have half a year in the making until I get Leon or Crow. Good luck to both of us!
---
Really? I got Tara and Frank And I'm I remember correctly, Spike in the same week. Luck is building up for you my dude
---
He took it from the game where you can select and rotate the brawlers and cropped it.

that's cool, thanks for the info pal

I'm 100% sure yesterday, few hours before i wrote this comment, it was bugged and the target behind did not take the 3 spread damage.

I remembered i played one showdown with her and i couldn't killed the box behind like i did before with the spread shots

I have been playing for about a year. Have about 3000 3v3 wins and 500 duo

Pretty sure you lose trophies every time this happenens too cause I've played a fair few games against 2 players and vise versa

I'm at 7.5k since global lol

agree
---
You know the game started in portrait right?
---
Bitch we need Brock and Darryl to have voices and you're complaining about voices added? Even Bo needs one, but I guess not having a voice fits his character. Even so he could just express in grunts.
---
Welcome. You really deserve more votes and comments

Won't each drop have its own chance.  Since mega box is worth 10 boxes, each drop will have the same chance, but there is more drops?
---
If Mortis gets that buff he should get double times slower reload speed.
---
I love Jessie‚ù§Ô∏è

what look will you have if you see my profile f2p with 3/3 leggy and zero epic and 1/2 mythic?

Same here but i got crow and spike

I kinda like it tbh

This is beatiuful.

Wtf i'm so jealous

I think his reload speed is enough slow.

OG players could buy him at lower trophies he wasn‚Äôt a trophy road reward so yeah

I see a lot of people getting leon offer talking about it in this subreddit. Is it a necessary level or something for this offer appear for you?
---
(:
---
Haha yeh
---
I‚Äôd say anywhere from now till 1 month away to your next leggy if you collect all the free brawl boxes and big boxes
---
does the API still work for you? I get a permanent API reponse with morse code.
---
1. Maining a character will put you in harder matches since matchmaking is based on brawler trophies. It will put you in games which you won't find fun and your team won't find fun because you don't have the game knowledge yet
---
2. Yes, get them all to level 6 or 7
---
3. Save for robo rumble
---
4. You can buy them if you like the brawler or if they are lower level
---
umm,this is not Fortnite
---
nowhere yet xD
---
What you mean?
---
He has one of the strongest star powers in the entire game. Once hes lvl 10 he's actually pretty overpowered. 
---
Didn‚Äôt say it was lol
---
?????? Look I‚Äôm not saying you‚Äôre idea is absolutely terrible it just needs some refining, because games like that look different in an FPS like COD than in a MOBA like brawl stars. In brawl stars teaming is far easier and has more to do with dps than actually hitting and oneshotting someone.
---
I think muting sound mutes the voice lines too.
---
Looks good!
---
You start with a higher legendary chance
---
Oh my god, i NEED THIS.
---
Wow
---
Turn the volume down.
---
Have yt channel as well
---
It‚Äôs a great star power, but his main attack is still lacking compared to other brawlers imo
---
In some language Poco means song. It's used as slang in Belgium and the Netherlands for song but I don't know what language it's originally from. 
---
ok. but then, about what season youre talking about?
---
When used correctly he can dominate in every gamemode other than heist. He doesn't need a buff because you don't know how to use him.
---
Yep it is go check some vids 
---
*mortis has entered the chat*

Yes xD
---
Why are 400 and 300 trophy players up against 700+ lol
---
It just happened to me
---
Thank you!  
---
Last question, about the Leon offer that some people are receiving. Is there a level to receive the offer?
---
lol
---
rofl. just tap. 
---
Always know when to team and when not to. Always know which brawlers you can team with. And if you have a feeling that someone's about to betray you try to get as much distance to him as possible (Or if it's a thrower... be as close to him as possible)
---
When Pam was released the junker family (or what ever it is spelled I‚Äôm not English lol) was ‚Äúcreated‚Äù it is confirmed that Pam is Jessie‚Äôs mother, and a lot of people think colt is Jessie‚Äôs brother, and their father is bull (there is also some people who think bull is Pam‚Äôs ex now)
---
That Captain America flip looks so cool but was really impractical. I mean, all of that just to smack someone‚Äôs head.

Go to Shop, tap in a big box, tap the info button

Is it possible to learn this power?
---
They seem to just hangout at 200 ish trophies 
---
This happened to me yesterday, I closed the game and entered in the game again and it was solved.
---
What were your chances?
---
&gt;His super has pretty much no downside, and the time before he can attack is pretty much non existent
---
Then why do pro's think he needs to finish his super faster?
---
the finger is covering the letter "m"
---
What you see is the info of the normal box. A big box is the same as opening 3 boxes, and a megabox is the same of opening 10 boxes
---
Perhaps, I‚Äôve pushed my Leon to rank 16 and now usually I‚Äôm the only Leon in the match. However one every few battles there will be multiple Leon‚Äôs in the match
---
Awesome randoms are hard to find, you had some bad luck.
---
&gt;Piper is an epic rarity, so less people are likely to have her
---
Frank is also epic, so I don't get your point
---
What joke? 
---
0.00000019 Chance to pull Spike after getting these... 
---
I play it with my logitech controller daily..
---
It never worked on Supercell games...
---
is that I was looking for references for my drawing, and on instagram I found a picture of some ladies doing what you see in the photo, but there was no subject eating chicken in the background
---
Yea but that‚Äôs always been there at least for me
---
You just have to wait, wait for a good minute, then it‚Äôs not working.
---
It used to work before global 
---
First of all, if you're tired of randoms and not having people to play with I suggest joining a good club and also the Brawlstars official discord (invite code is Brawlstars I think). But onto the main topic: Frank. His super really isn't that fast and you have enough time to react unless you're too close and have no way of dealing with him. If that's what's happening you need to focus on keeping you're distance. But Frank has a lot of counters. Anybody with a knockback/disrupt super counters Frank's super. Therefore Shelly, dynamike, primo, Piper, Tara and maybe even Darryl can negate his super. No downsides you say? Well how about it's not hard to disrupt and that means your super was wasted. I guess Bo can be used to counter Frank or at least hold him back with his mines. And Frank's normal attack doesn't have that much range. Only a few brawlers have shorter range and the short delay means if you're bear the edge you can run out of it making it slightly difficult for a Frank to charge his super on the first place. Even if he does mange to charge super, he would have taken damage from you and your team charging up your supers which might be able to counter him. Also Leon and Mortis can kind of counter him by running back and forth (I've done it a few times but I have yet to master doing it). Also the fact that he stops to attack makes him vulnerable and easy to hit. Hope this helps and GL!
---
Aaay,  muchas graxias en verdad :'3
---
More like the monkey skull go shoot other enemy at the base, while the gem holder is being chased by a midrange. 
---
Needless to say the enemy walks off with fresh gems.
---
Yea, go to the shop, click on the big box and click on the ‚Äúi‚Äù on the left and it‚Äôll show you the chances. My legendary chance was .09 this morning until I got leon, which reseted it down to .03. Is this what they call ‚Äúsuffering from success?‚Äù
---
Then why not just comment on the previous post?

I WANT LEON
---
I had also thought about drawing them in the background, all of them in fact, but the idea was that bull was the fun. Like, I have not finished doing fanarts, maybe I will also do it as a bonus :3
---
Not atm, leon is better. More versatile, effective at multiple ranges, mobile, more health... 
---
you have to close the app and reopen it.
---
stop bully me

FBI wants to know your location

You got the Pam, we can go home now

Nice idea.

I never team with a Bull, Shelly, Leon or Primo, I can‚Äôt trust them

No, it just contains more small goodies. Chances of getting a legendary remain constant no matter the box.

Right.

He has eyes only for the bush...

Blame the youtubers. They are telling and pushing people to play one brawler, stick with it until they max it out for their star power.

Here in Mexico it is common that at parties a photographer will bother you to take pictures of the most uncomfortable moments of the party dinner. suppose it was one of those :) ((I say it for the poor bull))

2000 trophy talking
---
But he is an assasin and assasins should never be able to kill tanks thats the point I am trying to make.
---
It goes paired with some trophy losses too. Albeit just one loss.
---
I have both, spike is almost certainly better in mid to long ranges 
---
Lol
---
Brawlers levels have nothing to do with matchmaking
---
I don‚Äôt have one yet
---
I got that as well and then I lost 6 trophies bc of it when I was one away from rank 16
---
Tencent would never allow it. Or, rather, *China* would never allow it.
---
So you threw the game for what reason?
---
Tmis this is a graphic tool?! Or something like that?!
---
Maybe photoshop the logo so it fits more with the art theme. Everything else is so good, so far I can't imagine you not getting top three. Great work!
---
Very nice
---
I don't know, but it exists

When teammates go after the max health El Primo with zero gems rather than Poco who's alone in the corner without super with 13 gems.

---
S√≥ faz o que eu disse, faz melhor que eu
---
Yes because we should totally balance a brawler towards less skill players right? Enough of this Communism bullshit
---
As in say bull, shelly, darryl yes.
---
You got Pam
---
Hahahahahah so true noobs needa stop bragging 
---
Needs more neon leon
---
this is really frustrating you always have to close the app and open it.Fix the servers  
---
I will add some stones on this map... if it's convenient for another players =)

I haven't got Pam
---
Oh yes

Then that's where I need never to be.

I like what's in the middle, but the vertical walls at the bottom or top are basically useless.
---
5k don't have Frank or any higher brawlers
---
Not much but still sad

Supercell: 2019 Will be a great year for Brawl Stars
---
the COMMUNITY *hentai stars*
---
Nothing some colouring in ms paint wont fix
---
Emm, where is the map?
---
Love it !
---
I know. It‚Äôs sarcasm. 
---
The image of a brawler beside your name (mines darrel) to get one tap your name and it says "choose flair" 
---
Hey I played w u loool
---
180 but this is a great idea because there is no sense with seasons you only lose trophies and get a little bit tokens.
---
Well on the bright side, you didn't loose any trophy.
---
Nerfing autoaim
---
Eu vou ficar atras de karma, seu boludo? Se toca
---
I think there should be one person on a team that picks up gems while the other 2 will focus on kills to hold the enemy back 
---
Yes but bc only way a Leon SHOULD get to you is with super
---
Frank isn't op. He's perfectly balanced. If you maintain good map control, and have peripheral vision on enemy brawlers, you will never get hit by Frank's super. Plus, many brawlers can straight up negate it anyways. 
---
The neon peon leon 
---
Reportado. No puedes publicar en espa√±ol aqu√≠
---
Leon being op doesn't mean the player behind leon is also op.
---
Matches start at 2:30 and count down
---
Those crazy russians
---
Sorry, lol. The website I was using said it would automatically link it to my post. My map is on "Pixel Crux". 
---
Dynamike's projectiles explode after a while of being on the ground
---
Love it man! Nice work
---
Ohh thats why, you are too low level for the offer to appear but keep playing it ill maybe appear for youüòï
---
I‚Äôm done talking to your 14 y/o dumbass, it‚Äôs like talking to a brick wall. You don‚Äôt even consider my points, you‚Äôre just like ‚Äúhurr durr I pushed with him so he isn‚Äôt bad without starpower‚Äù
---
I see your point but every other assassin does full damage at max range except Leon 
---
Barley is so much better than Dyna. He can control the area easily and has a log of DPS with super. He doesn't need any buff
---
Epic
---
I'm with you xD
---
It's fine to play 1 brawler, as long as you're good, and the map/mode is a good fit
---
There's the link!
---
Oh sorry. I never paid attention to it, so I assumed the timer would count up.
---
Thx I thought it was like this but then thought about it that it could just be 180 and not 420
---
His stats are already OP compared to other brawlers, there's only one problem: autoaim. What's the point of getting close to other people when they can do full damage by tapping as fast as they can?
---
True. I forgot to add neon green to the little details, oof
---
Thanks mate
---
Fastest kid alive
---
There will be one new skin almost every week
---
And his names greenüò±
---
Yeah basically making this game Pay to Win
---
Noice
---
Nearly every reward in brawl stars is useless... you reach 11k trophies and get 300 gold cmon
---
So like his super?
---
Ofc this is photoshopped... it's a meme -_-
---
I wonder if they're in a bush .....
---
Supercell we want leonosaurus! 
---
Lol. "Lose to Leon"
---
That would be way too hard...

The scientist isn‚Äôt a new brawer, it was a fan made concept a few months ago here on reddit. The edit into the brawlers screen was also made by the concept creator, including the exact art. 
---
They were probably flashing through concepts and that one happened to pop up on the screen
---
#NITA THE POOH
---
Oh, wow thanks! Only 1700 more and I can finally buy 1/22 star powers!!!!
---
Who knows if they‚Äôll add it though! They‚Äôve added fan concepts before 
---
Yeah have point
---
machtmaking :|
---
Honestly, I don't really care. I'm just more happy that you have his hat on. Like, I get really 
---
#TRIGGERED when people use the "so-called-default" skin. I literally try to lose because that is a huge offense.
---
Just spend some money /s
---
Yea like a ninja one because this one looks so good! Keep up the great work
---
Thank you sooo much!
---
It‚Äôs photoshopped 
---
i don‚Äôt understand some ppl have thousands unopened. they wud have to buy power then
---
Ofc it's a damn memeüòÇ
---
Even though it doesn't have the hat, I'd buy that without question. I absolutely love this!
---
i didn't do that some people downvote random stuff
---
Agreed!

TY, seen so much of these memes, and half of them aren't good.

---
wym not necessarily, this was a mirror match up except for the difference of leon and barley. you have a nita aswell. once leon has his super its over for the lane that has to face him.
---
Be honest, did you team?:p
---
These people are the realest.
---
Yeah but your giving them a chance instead of forcing them to spend 10 seconds getting over there and 5 seconds going for one guy while everyone else is focus firing on him
---
You better watch out
---
I mean, I‚Äôm trying to WIN a dont want to gove them a chance of winning
---
I'm Macedonian
---
I bet they are waiting when 50% of players get him so that when they nerf him the entire community rages
---
That‚Äôs why I like him
---
Then your wanting to take the fun out of it for them
---
Haha. Good point. I saw that ep too! Thanks! 
---
Not even. In fact, I‚Äôm so great, I have an extra chromosome 
---
No, thats not my goal, my goal is to win, im not going to go over to their side of the map just so they can have more fun, and i lose
---
Still not making a sens
---
Thanks! I wanted to restrict the party to common, rare, and super rare brawlers. That's why Leon isnt invited. 
---
Drawing is ok but you should improve on your colouring. Keep going, boy.
---
Me after 18 months playing BS and still missing all the legendaries 
---
Lol I don‚Äôt have any legendary n I m in 8k 
---
So... some kind of knife with a shovel huh
---
They have to do this... Is not good to exit and reinvite a friend !! Wake up Brawl Stars teamtell us something new!
---
Jesus Christ wish I had 16 when I was at 1500 trophies... You're even complaining that you don't get another one? C'mon man...
---
Looks like barleys brother
---
Thank you very much! :)
---
Top players go up against leon with throwers and still win on this map ,they are also top players so it‚Äôs not like leon carried us , I did a lot of the damage especially the max penny on the opposition ,even tho she should have won those battles 
---
Love it! Also i know you're from serbia and probably in Elementary school since i have the same book. 
---
Nah, it‚Äôs just raining
---
This actually blows my mind. Have to spend at least $40 to buy him. Honestly can‚Äôt believe it.
---
They could be. A BARtender and a BARber together are BARbots.
---
If you watch some YouTube videos (I suggest Kairos, Lex, Coach Cory, and Rey) they probably have videos on the different roles there are in all the modes
---
Looks too much like clash of clans
---
I'm not saying you should head to there side, but I am saying to at least not be a ass and hide in the corner of your side, staying in the middle to make it fair
---
But it looks great :)
---
You drew Nita and Leon nicely. 
---
They annoy me too... ( f.e. OG Star Shelly Skin... OG?!?!? (are they kidding me?!?!))
---
i dont get it
---
Woaah this is awesome, great job!!
---
If played correctly, any of the brawlers are annoying to play against. It's all a matter of defending properly which can be tricky based on several variables within that game
---
I can't see any differencr
---
I would love to seeing barley having brother
---
Compare this to Check, or a Moba. This is nothing. The strategy in this game is so basic you can‚Äôt call even call it tactic.
---
Not fair
---
That‚Äôs BULLying
---
Yep. Add Penny and Pam and you have one annoying combo.
---
No shit....
---
I'm not saying it's a high strategy level game but the fact you're saying there's no strategy when you only have 2.5k trophies is hilarious and shows a good bit of ignorance to the competitiveness of the game.
---
Yeah, I recently discovered Kairos and I've been progressively watching all his videos, I especially like the brawler guides. Thanks for the other recommendations, I'll check them out.
---
Is there a pattern to deciding who the gem carrier is in a game with randoms? Like is there a signal that's commonly used, or it's just whoever takes the initiative/total chaos?
---
Iy never happened to me. I love the meteorite because i never lost a match in brawl ball and bounty
---
Omg üòÇ 
---
Byotifull
---
He mains brawlers thats why
---
These are the abilities of pakko from gigantic
---
Yeah I just figured, my bad. 
---
Every mobile game is p2w.. it‚Äôs how they stay in business without flooding you with ads. 
---
Also the game is skill based and not time/money spent. You‚Äôre correct that p2w has an advantage but it‚Äôs small enough that you‚Äôre making mountains out of molehills. 
---
It‚Äôs highly possible that two f2p players in a match have different levels because of how the spent their coins. Not to mention the level scaling is much better in this game than CR. 
---
Team up with people. Brawl Stars is all teamwork. Even in solo showdown lol
---
I believe he was agreeing with my statement
---
I posted the same thing but it was like. 1480%. Post got deleted for low effort. Makes sense mods
---
Holy shit this is godly
---
Just dodge her shots because they are slow, and stay away from other brawlers, so it doesn‚Äôt insta-bounce to you if they get hit. That should also help with the turret being placed a lot problem. 
---
It‚Äôs too empty, I understand you trying to make a map that‚Äôs in favor of sharpshooters but this is just... not good as of now.
---
Are you making sure all of your brawlers are around the same trophy area or are you just playing the same couple brawlers?
---
Nice concept but I don't like having more bots tbh
---
I love them. I got the app to listen more. Oh and btw shelly shoots 5 shots just like bull for a regular attack.
---
Shelly's super shoots 7 shots.
---
Prob best I‚Äôve seen but people would think Colt shoots lasers
---
You‚Äôll see the skulls on the deep siege map are breakable barriers
---
This is so true it hurts
---
 Check kairos‚Äôs channel for the tier list
---
I felt the same way! üòÇ 
---
That was a different one...
---
Ok I tried to do this but it would not accept a lowercase c so can it be capital?
---
This might be my last bot brawler. And thanks!
---
MS paint, approx 5 months
---
Oh cool, I hadn't seen that map yet.
---
Technically anybody can say it people just choose not to
---
You know there‚Äôs something up if you‚Äôre killing Leon‚Äôs as poco in showdown
---
This is the case for no Leon dude.  
---
If he have the Leon he would have jumped 
---
3 dots in top right click change flair
---
randoms? If not then makes sense because the highest trophy brawler is poco, at similar trophies to the enemy team.
---
I laughed at the end
---
the baby bear i chose is already considered pretty much a teenager, and the size i gave the mother bear is extra large, seeing as most female bears barely reach 4 ft. therefor it is a big baby bear. also the big might just be referring to how fluffy he is

You should totally draw penny and her mortar

based on your luck, your next brawlers in march 2020

$33 USD is $45.81 Australian dollarydoos.  
---
I do good if I survive the initial skirmishes. But I always aggressively try to get a free box or two and just get deleted. Its probably on my play stile rather than the brawler himself.

Elusive + worth $69,99 ?

Dei um novo efeito ao tiro dela e do morteiro para ver se ficava uma skin mais legal, mas pouca gente gostou.

I actually just got Tara right now two hours after I did this post. This post feels a bit weird now since I got a brawler after I complain not getting enough brawlers XD.
---
LOVE THIS 
---
Awful post

Its because OG is so good at the game he is able to push trash brawlers

Trophies?

IMO the only thing worth spending on is the level packs. Your going down a slippery road if you start doing this. If you are already on that road then fuck ya

I remember sucking up to my parents when I wanted a new game lol. I‚Äôve got a job now so thankfully I‚Äôm just trying to convince myself not to buy it and eventually give in

Thanks for the hate!

Agreed, but you have to be good with him though 
---
Forgot to mention no one in my team is online and I‚Äôm eager to do this

Ok this game is not a high skill game. Thats a lie. It has an extremely low skill capped when compared to other Mobas. You literally only have 2 moves. This game is took maby elements from the the biggest Moba and most competitive game of all time, League of Legends, and dumbed it down to a mobile game. League has 140 characters each with 5+ unique moves and abilities, with customizable passive runes, and hundreds of buildable items, extreme team play, and one of the highest skill caps of any game. There's literally infinite game knowledge to learn. Its hard to say brawl stars is a skill game when its level based and there's so little mechanics there. Its addictive sure but come one. Those guys at lvl 1 at 500 obviously queue with high ass level teammates that carried them. Of course there are people good at that this game, but nobody is going to give a shit about a "brawl stars world tournament" because its games would look exactly like all the games at 500 plus trophies. In league, the biggest game ever, Challenger rank has 200 players. How is there so little? People actually have ways to demonstrate skill. You look up build guides, watch videos, practice skillshots, and learn the thousands of mechanics in the game, and then you lose because the other guy has more skill and understands the game better. Compare that to thinking you're the shit because you walked around a bush and auto attacked as a bull and killed someone. Literally ANYONE can do that. Im serious, you have no idea what a really skill based game is like.
---
You‚Äôre probably on the red team then
---
How about a new brawl ball map 
---
Oh ya well I can draw one of those legs in an hour
---
3 weeks and nerfed. Are we hoping new brawlers?
---
Now try it at power 6 on a a character that isnt a legendary. Headass
---
You got to understand that this guy is a god at the game. A average/good player will never get that far.
---
Yea
---
Ok, but there's no way to counter him really. You have to just hide in a bush, hope he doesn't shoot dynamites at you and also hope he gets close enough so you can tear his fucking face into mince mess with bull's big three barrel shotgun.
---
It's beautiful... ( Ôºõ‚àÄÔºõ)

Hello my baby, hello my honey,
---
Water gives advantage to long-ranged brawlers only.
---
Beta when it was just for canada like before it was globallt released and how many chests have you opened bc it global releases December and its January and you almost got every Brawler
---
Main problem with him is auto aim shotgunners which make it difficult to get through 1-350

 It's here give gem and cover photo
