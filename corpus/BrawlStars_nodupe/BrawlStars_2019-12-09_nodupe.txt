Solo takedown is takedown üôÉ

No please officer. I only used it to make fun. I shall pay for my sins
---
Thank you!
---
hate random
---
I think this bug is on everyone‚Äôs device. Just brought it up. The auto clicker would have to be insanely fast too
---
I have an idea, players who have more than 11500 cups if a legendary will be given one for free on the trophy road
---
You right, it's just my opinion and you can do whatever you want with your ideas. Good luck
---
I'm a man of law,not a priest.my cause is just,and that's to keep reddit free of emojis
---
Yeah
---
Bruce‚Äôs icon should be angry when he is attacking someone.
---
Thank you very much.
---
I have power points for every brawler i have and the minimum i get is around 46 gold and the maximum i remember is 130
---
HawhblabalababahA!
---
Yes sir I salute you

He‚Äôs not supposed to be so handsome lmao üòÇ

nice! i wanna hug her-she actually looks cute
---
u didnt give time to see final picture
---
Impressive. How long did the push take?

Genial

Bruh, U play or watchüòÇ

i wonder why darryl is the only one without a skin
---
Supercell please add this as a skin
---
Bot 8-Bit(ch)

Wait isn't it the other way around
---
Its a star power.
---
Very good but the penny is a bit creepy.

#-INHALES- AMAZING

Its okay to say your own criticism. That‚Äôs what the comments are for. But at least be supportive.
---
tick clutch
---
Um...OkayüòÇ
---
you read my comment? i said, ‚Äò‚Äô have alredy a heal star power‚Äô‚Äô because she‚Äôll have 2 star powers that heal, i prefer the other one who slow enemies
---
That is a bad brawler idea, way too much range, health, and damage, and no clear weaknesses
---
My friend got 2 legendarys in one day i i have non 
---
His trophies:6100
---
My trophies:10000
---
I like having solo showdown in there because most of the time i have to rely on randoms on the 3v3s which half of the time is good and half is bad

#Credits:
---
First, I want to thank u/Pudding_Cadet for creating the brawler model. I also want to thank u/KairosTime_Gaming for the inspiration for creating this brawler idea. Thank you u/YerChappyRichy for replying so quickly. I made her a ‚Äòbit‚Äô too strong so I nerfed her stats a bit. :/

#Description:
---
Ruby throws two gems in a X-shape toward her targets! Her super deploys a powercube to boost herself or her teammate
---
*Attack (Dual Diamond):* Ruby throws 2 gems at her enemies in a X-shape. The gems pierce enemies. Shiny!
---
*Super (Power Boost):* Ruby deploys a powercube to boost herself or her teammate. Each powercube offers 10% more damage and¬†+400 health.
---
*NOTE:*
---
- Powercubes, that Ruby spawned, can't be picked up by the enemy team (that‚Äôs why they look different).
---
- Powercubes, that Ruby spawned, don't drop when a brawler, holding these, goes down. 
---
- The powercube, Ruby spawns, is shared in duo showdown. 
---
- Ruby can hit her enemy only once per attack (just like Jessie / Rico‚Äôs super)
---
#Stats level 1 (max. level)
---
- Rarity: Trophy Road Reward (10.000 trophies)
---
- Health: 3000 (4200)
---
- Damage per gem: 940 (1316)
---
- Range: 9.33
---
- Super charge: 8 hits
---
- Super range: 6
---
- Reload speed: 1.7s
---
- Movement speed: 720 (Shelly / Nita / etc.)
---
- Projectile speed: 3478 (Rico‚Äôs)
---
- Star power 1 (Ancient Alchemy): Ruby's super also creates a temporary healing station, healing 500 per second for 3 seconds. (Radius: 3.67)
---
- Star power 2 (Crystal Rush): Brawlers that pick up a powercube, Ruby spawned, gain a 24% movement speed boost for 3 seconds.
---
*NOTE:* Movement speed boosts don't stack. E.g. a Carl that uses his super while gaining movement speed from Crystal Rush, won't go faster than normal.
---
#Possible voicelines:
---
*Start of battle:*
---
- My grandfather taught me how to fight.
---
- Let's get to work.
---
- Do you like gems? Prepare to eat some.
---
*When in the lead:*
---
- I am shining so bright!
---
- It looks like I am just too shiny.
---
- You'll never beat me!
---
*Once hurt:*
---
- Ouch!
---
- Was that¬†necessary?
---
- You want more, huh?
---
*Getting a kill:*
---
- Shiny!
---
- You asked for it!
---
- Yay, I did it!
---
*When dying:*
---
- I failed.
---
- I just wanted to make you shine!
---
- It's so shiny.
---
*When attacking:*
---
- Beautiful!
---
- Oops, I totally did that by accident.
---
- I ain't done with you yet.
---
*When using a super:*
---
- We are unbeatable.
---
- I bet this will help.
---
- You're welcome.
---
#Possible skin:
---
Eskimo Ruby
---
- Throws snowflakes.
---
#Backstory / Personality:
---
Ruby is Dynamike's granddaughter. She is a teenager and she loves helping her grandfather in the mines. Ruby completes the Miner trio: Dynamike / Carl / Ruby. That was my inspiration for creating this brawler. Huge thanks to u/KairosTime_Gaming. 
---
#Thanks for reading! Have a shiny day! :p
---
Why their attention are to focused on skins and new brawlers but not on things that are demanded since forever, like a report button or a remake to trophy road?
---
ok
---
Season reset....
---
What was, do you think I was joking, I played a whole bounty match, got 7 stars and never got hit once until the end, deactivated 5 bo mines in the same match and I can never do that with even crow.
---
agree. my legendary brawler % was at 2% and I got a legendary. Thats 1/50 which is decent. All it takes is time. Daily keys and tokens
---
It should show a icon when it's alive and when it dies it opens it's mouth and has Xs on the eyes then blurs out of existence
---
All fine exept for mortis, buffing him like that would break the game...
---
Hol up
---
DarrGene?..GeneRyl?..DarrEne?..GenArryl?
---
Yeah, that might work.Anyway i love balancing brawlers.That's a shame that i'm a minor,i am far away of Brawl Stars Center (or where the staff works for BS) and i can't work for Supercell. But i saw they created apps as Supercell Maker and Supercell Creator and i can't wait to buy a new pc for Christmas and start to work for those 2 apps.
---
Anime xd
---
Idk why but im starting to feel some type of way about El'Primo
---
"jajaj"
---
Who downvotes even this! I know it looks bad but do you people add better tributes?
---
Lone star duos sounds like bounty but with extra steps
---
Lost in new
---
Like u can do better boomerü§°
---
Your probably right, it will most likely come a bit before the 12th since that's the birthday. Not guarenteed
---
I love it thank you
---
Lowkey thats kinda pink piper with roses in her hair
---
‚ÄúAfter all these years, I have them all.‚Äù Its  so dope!
---
Yes it is
---
Well that is good that you already have a carrer in mind
---
Twice per attack with 1316 damage, and it pierces?  7,896 DMG is overkill. Total team wipeout. Not to mention the powercube or 8-Bit's ult and that 9+ tile range.
---
The starpowers are icing on the cake.
---
My first common: colt
---
My first rare: Brock before trophy road update
---
Super rare: Poco (before change)
---
First epic: piper
---
First mythic: Tara
---
First legendary: crow
---
First star power: medical use
---
I can beat Leon with crow he has been nerfed that much
---
I'm talking about close range!
---
I just thought he had a slow reload speed and short range. Thanks for the feedback!üëç
---
You know how many times I have got top 4 because I kill someone with a bunch of stars in the last like 5 seconds after running around for 2 minutes not being able to get a kill
---
I wouldve upvoted your comment if you only put the first sentence...
---
too accurate
---
Heres a new one!
---

---
coah corry: eh a solid 5 outta 10
---
or
---
one outta ten for the frank
---
Not yet zoomer üòè
---
Thanks!
---
True. Also her turret range is going to be abused. Like there's gonna be a Brock/ Piper sniping from the turret and killing half the server
---
Tbh he‚Äôs not all that bad. I got him to rank 25 without starpower with no problems at all. He‚Äôs not too weak or too strong. He doesn‚Äôt need more nerfs, but a tiny buff wouldn‚Äôt hurt.
---
whats wrong with it? i see nothing wrong at all
---
It was dead like a month ago but ok redditor
---
It only lasts for 3 seconds though. And the range is .33 smaller than Pam‚Äôs.
---
Congrats ! Btw I matched with you a few times day before yesterday .
---
On your cake day aswell!!!
---
Don't we all at some point?
---
Clicking on my brawler to change and rdying up at the same time
---
They knew! I had no idea until you told me :D
---
He did
---
But if a Brock hits all of the shots and gets his super off before it ends you know we're dead
---
it is high effort but tbh the art style straight up doesn't look good
---
Repost?

I have diagnosed depression so fair point.

---
He‚Äôs been getting a lot of recognition lately, at least compared to how much he usually gets
---
Thx
---
I barely see him
---
I don‚Äôt understand, could you explain that? :/
---
Yeah, he‚Äôs pretty uncommon
---
[deleted]
---
^(hablaahabla)
---
Great idea, the stats and abilities might be a bit op.
---
Apparently needed the time for a shitty meme and unnecessary thank you
---
Wow just wow tell her its amazing
---
Someone just told me about that, now she isn‚Äôt able to hit an enemy twice per attack, and I nerfed her super charge rate.
---
Well spike can't talk...
---
Thnx :)
---
Now her super charge is 8 hits, if she isn‚Äôt able to get her super often, the star powers aren‚Äôt as broken. I don‚Äôt want to nerf her damage and range because I want her to be strong when you aim your shots right. :p
---
Terrible idea, everyone would take advantage of it
---
In 5 hours, or in 29 hours
---
No hints of editing? Have you ever played brawl stars before?
---
:/
---
Not a bad idea, but with this you'll have to remove SD too, due to it not being competive either
---
Looks like mans going in for the kiss and she‚Äôs turning away due to bad breadth
---
I prefer Lonestar because there are no campers
---
Great minds think alike!
---
No emojis allowed thanks
---
Honestly I agree. I don't know why people downvote you just for having a different opinion. You can even tell from the comments that these are all kids.
---
Whatever sounds more balanced I suppose. Probably at the speed of the attack.
---
But why? Showdown doesn't have the same problems as the other two. There's no real luck involved. Plus, the map gets smaller, which is a huge help.
---
Pff, damn right she is
---
i like this
---
Do you know there are gamemodes without bushes?
---
More like "Super Chaining"
---
I wish they let us change the size the of the movement stick, thats all i want, to change the size of the fat ass joystick so i can make it smaller, therefore to not to drag halfscreen across the phone to move the goddamn char√°cter more confortably. Surelly nobody else has any issue or uses a gamepad or whatever but its just my personal opini√≥n and something that would make gameplay more of a blessing rather than frustation.

Not related to the topic, but since everyone is asking different things, might as well share mine.
---
1/ Does the game takes team composition into account for matchmaking? There's definitely a strong relationship between roles, maps, modes and brawlers. The make up of a team could potentially decide the course game.
---
2/Also the relationship between maps and brawler created new problems for powerplay. Some players might have no option for other brawlers with star power, so they have to play a map that is extremely disadvantageous for them, which in turns, hinders their teammates. What can be done to address this?
---
Are the crystal gems
---
What ever you painted with i love it, plus the drawing itself is wholesome

How so you save up that much.....

Haha A+ for effort botty nice try tho
---
üò§üò§üò§
---
I havent gotten one yet now at 12k, lucky player
---
So pam‚Äôs a karen?
---
No, it‚Äôs indeed a double kill. If you take a look at their stars; Darryl had 7, Mortis had 2 while Crow had 4. The current stars the Dyna had gotten are 4, which if Dyna were to have gotten them all, it should have increased to 17 (7+2+4) Stars in total. However, it only went up to 15. If you look at the names of the kill, they match exactly the Mortis and Crow, hence the Dyna had only gotten 2 of them. That‚Äôs why it increased to 15 (7+4) Stars only.
---
Your post has been removed, make sure to use the body of a post to elaborate on the title.
---
Both.
---
If matchmaking was based on total trophies I would start a new acc and get shelly to rank 35 in 2 days
---
thats why they killed it lol
---
But it's not duo star, it's Lone Star.
---
Maybe it will be at 12th, cuz this is Global release day, or 14th, cuz in calendar(or something on reddit i saw) that date is with (?).
---
And colt has a long range, giving him an advantage...... So we can say leon is worse than even colt
---
Which mode?
---
I wasn‚Äôt bummed about my 3v3, i have a fine experience in it by just playing my lower brawlers, I was just using it to show why I feel lone star is superior for a solo player
---
leon is the only boy cuz all gems are girls and leon as steven
---
Matchmaking at it's finest
---
r/screenshotsarehard
---
Poco‚Äôs one give me Beta remembers
---
Not so sure,its probably gonna be on 12th december bcz thats when the global release was

I hope it is brawl talk

The update will probably come out on the 12th to celebrate the anniversary of the game. Brawl talk usually comes out 3 or 4 days before a update so it could very well be out tomorrow!
---
Thats good
---
OH... MY... GAWD... 
---
PAM IS A THIC CAREN AND SHE'S LOOKING FOR A MANAGER
---
Feels bad
---
Bruh im dumb linebackers the blue one
---
why?
---
She is a miner after all, I thought it would make sense if she just throws them.
---
Why does Supercell allow all the scammy box simulator apps?
---
My little brother spent hours watching ads on one of these apps, and he was so disappointed when he opened the real game and saw that he didn't have all the brawlers he thought he had won  :( He was confused since they have "Brawl Stars" in their title and use the official graphics. These apps have millions of downloads on Android so lots of other people are probably confused too... I just don't understand why Supercell doesn't do something?
---
Wrong. Goddess in brawl ball, great in siege, ok in gem grab, and if your teammates can give you an opening, clutch in heist. I'm guessing your at 8k or below, which is why you think she's not op.
---
Weird how there's a space between the boxes and events
---
Well I forgot without duo showdown, solo showdown without teaming obviously requieres a lot of skill
---
Just turn on locked movment
---
upvote my post about the report function aswell
---
Glad to be on service üëâüëâ
---
https://youtu.be/XB490ZBQKuQ this is the unlisted video. It's a very old brawl talk before the global release.
---
Bah she played like she tried her best
---
But there is always ‚Äòteaming‚Äô. When there are 3 brawlers left: 2 brawlers with each 2 powercubes and 1 brawler with 8. It‚Äôs natural that the 2 brawlers team up to fight the bigger thread, but that‚Äôs unfair. The brawler with 8 cubes doesn‚Äôt get 1st because he played ‚Äòtoo good‚Äô. I don‚Äôt like showdown at all tbh. Also because of Morti that flee from everything and everyone, getting shot by three Piper‚Äôs at the same time (just an example) and the bushcamping. I just play it for the free star token.
---
Wtf you talking about, if she'd be op a lot of pros would have gotten her at rank 35. She's not that good in brawl ball. And what are you talking about? A lvl 6 Leon Can beat easily a shelly even at close range
---
Bottom panel super patrick bot 8-bit

Really? Thanks !
---
Lol, thank you üôè!
---
Xd that one got me

Thanksss!!!
---
it is actually based on both (and your localization)
---
Well, I thought it was more cursed because, it is a ¬´¬†bad¬†¬ª team vs a good boss.
---

13,800
---
Thx !
---
[removed]
---
Always gotta spin
---
Yeah. I got spike at 800, then leon at 10,000, crow at 12,000, and sandy now (13,800).
---
https://youtu.be/XB490ZBQKuQ not a bug, just an old brawl talk (sorry if this is the third time if I post this link in this comment section but I'm brobably one of the few people to have it)
---
So we had a Santa Carl idea now a lil helper mortis idea
---
https://youtu.be/XB490ZBQKuQ he's right
---
There is already camping in bounty, if there were no shields, one team would dominate
---
You can't swim in brawl stars all those who can rush or jump over there are not swimming
---
Leon isn‚Äôt a girl?
---
Ah that's why it's even more tougher to find matches since I'm living in a not very populated area. The more I progress the tougher the game will be üò≠ strict matchmaking ruins everything
---
Do you have leon? Because you would know shelly outclasses him in everything but range. She has a better super, faster charge rate for the super, more health, more max damage and a quicker reload. The only way to win as a leon is with spacing, which is more prone to getting teamed on. Also, the fact that you say she's not good in ball highlites that you can't be above 5k. So in short, leon loses up close without shellies super and especially with. Btw I've had 700 trophies on  leon within hour and a half of grinding, so you know I'm not trash with him.
---
WISH YOU A MERRY CHRISTMAS (ok im lookin forward to christmas lol)
---
I mean in poderplay, since youre forcee to play them if you want to have a good score at the end of the season, but you can just skip the daily events
---
*looks at watch*
---
Oh golly, it is indeed time to brawl
---
Then why did she/he stand IN the safe and didn't move at all
---
this actually fits him well
---
Fool I've been saving my 14k mega box since September  have 8 big boxes and 100 regular boxes can't wait to do a massive box opening hoping to get any new brawlers or crow.
---
Cool
---
That is fake bro. Dont believe that
---
I lost cus of her/him she/he was just standing in the save while I was fucking Battleing and when we got attack she/he just stood in place
---
Yes I do!
---
Its fake?
---
Calling the FBI brb
---
Crow is faster and also mortis.
---
r/okretard
---
Actually no they all have the same speed, its the "assassin speed" all assassins have it
---
Poco is one of the better brawlers, but not mine. I have Rico. I am just greatly inferior to the Colts.
---
you know he is going to get a remodel right?
---
Yeah, his reload speed changed to 2.2 sec is enough.
---
Look: All your comments get so many downvotes. That's how you can tell that your opinions mean nothing.
---
Momento dou Penny sin gorrito Penny dice douu
---
They need a 10k brawler
---
Is that communism I hear?
---
No
---
Seems manly for his death noise.Check it out at brawl stars fandom.The noise he makes is hilarious
---
Nice
---
You were expecting a crossover but it was me DIO
---
Have you heard his voice ? Ever ?
---
damn
---
Muda muda muda muda muda muda muda muda muda muda muda muda muda muda MUDA!
---
Ok
---
My brother got spike before 700 trophies
---
That sounds like stupid myth you would hear in school. Your myth sounds btw just stupid
---
Flair checks out :D
---
No no no
---
Is the mistery of history
---
I understand this is a meme on reddit and you are supposed to say "Nice".But PLEASE stoo trying to get karma off it!
---
1 day 2100ish trophy Es is a lot to gess
---
I hope you get Meteor Rush first..
---
Meteor Rush are very convenient Star Power in many mode 
---
Example SD/DS , GG, BB, Bounty, LS.. Even in Siege and Heist (you can use this Star Power to "Hit and/or Run")
---
Lmao, he is talking like he cant control the 'luck' involved in 3v3 mode which is randoms. Solution and 100% no risk? Get a goddamn team. Powerplay is a demonstration of skill and teamwork is a part of it. If you blame randoms for bad 3v3 'luck' and does nothing at all. It's your fault, not the mode's "luck". In solo you cant control anything at all, you either team or get teammed on, lucky or unlucky
---
Mostly if you are thrower
---
Hey, can you give me some tips? I hear that showdown is best with extra life, but I am struggling!
---
Ok well he thinks I am an alt account of yours
---
Yes
---
ur lucky i dont have spike
---
She can‚Äôt hear us then... quick! I need 2 gallons of inSalts!
---
wait hang on that sounds weird i mean ur lucky u have spike
---
You just discovered the romanien flag
---
Who is this from again?
---
ur name is cursed
---
You are wrong
---
Just like Michael Jackson!
---
https://youtu.be/j5iF8_-Hhqw
---
Darryl better
---
Okay , where is brawl talk
---
I don't think ill ever make that far with colt. It just stresses me too much to properly aim like a tryhard, specially with the game's shit controls. Still, congrats!
---
My god what happened to gene!?
---
I mean, most 3v3 players don't have a clue on the objective of the gamemode they're playing. If they were any better than me, they wouldn't pick Piper in Brawl Ball or Bull in Bounty. There are probably some people like that in this thread.
---
I agree on Lone-Star and thought we were talking about Solo. That is my mistake and I admit it. 
---
Also not being rude but if you cared less you wouldn't check my post history and use it against me. There's nothing in it.
---
Nice man
---
Annoying like a tick, but for real tho, him being added completely changed the game, and not in a good way.
---
now we know why the star has 6 sides
---
F
---
Sorry, I did it once by accident :)
---
Not surprised. That dude is so stubborn lol. Lost in his own thoughts.
---
It‚Äôs me. I‚Äôm randoms.
---
honestly why extend trophy road when only 1% of players has reached 14.8k trophies
---
AN I OOP-
---
Bibi: WHEN WILL I GET A SKIN?? YOU ALREADY RECEIVED THREE AND I STILL HAVE NONE.
---
Leon: *turns invisible and yeets outta Brawl Stars*
---
(Moral of the story: JUST GIVE BIBI, ROSA AND PAM SKINS ALREADY)
---
I think is a glitch too but they could do something to fix it
---
Damn dude we're almost at the same trophy range and the highest I have is mortis at 700 I'm slacking
---
Yeah they could
---
Coincidence? I think not!
---
Title makes no sense. Fucking foreigners
---
buying brawlers isnt worth it if you are a f2p. and leon is only good in sd and ls.
---
We he definitely isn't his or nitas father but has a chance of being their uncle or smth btw i was being ironic
---
i have el rudo so will not buy it
---
It happens a lot cause some pros invite their noob friends to play which basically=lose
---
I just wanted someone more consistent than Mortis, I love Mortis and main him, he‚Äôs so fun, but hard to push.
---
I have been reporting via chat about all the offensive names I find. Supercell always replies they will take action and thanks you. But I am not really sure if they actually do anything.
---
Which do you prefer?
---
Do you like RUDO or Rey better?
---
Anyone got the link for this video, cant see it on youtube?
---
Cant tell if thats pam or colt. It terrifies me either way
---
Cool but what does this have to do with brawl stars
---
Which one do you prefer, Rico or primo(buy Rico's skin if you prefer rico, it kinda has the same style to it)
---
Rico?
---
Oh yeah I know but I thought it would be an interesting thing to point out
---
Yeah Rico.....or should I say ricochet
---
Wait I‚Äôm confused, why Rico?
---
[The video](https://youtu.be/WrUCody_kAU) is in the news tab in Brawl Stars too. But [here](https://youtu.be/WrUCody_kAU) you go
---
I dont know how this come jere i click minecraft!!???
---
Because one of Rico's skins has a similar style to el ray
---
O ok, not that interested in Rico tho.
---
there few one tile gaps on bottom right and 1 one tile gap in the middle
---
I like how EMZ is taking a selfie of her self instead of a group photo
---
Ok.
---

I've never play Jessie before (only once). Yet i've been collecting Power Point for her
---
this is just a lazy ass recolor  of calvera piper nothing special and just a trash skin
---
Which app?
---
Google translate says it means ‚Äúburning sun‚Äù.
---
Is there an app callled ‚Äúrecord it!‚Äù
---
üòÇ

*chuckles* I‚Äôm in danger
---
Î≤ÑÎãùÏç¨ means Burning Sun. It is a music group in Korea but there are some criminals that  in that group.
---
I got Poco from free box. It was a year ago.....
---
I‚Äôd be surprised if anyone ever does that
---
And my old account got changed because i was called IloveAss
---
#WE KNOW
---
Thought about the same thing, i'm a few gems short, but i hate primo so i'm not gonna buy
---
And then there's 8 9
---
People who scream StOp sAyInG iTs bRaWl tAlK are even worse than the ones saying it's brawl talk
---
True
---
If i saw this in real life i would call the cops
---
Dude you can‚Äôt kick ransoms in power play, tf are u talking about.  There isn‚Äôt a play again button, so every match is a coin flip.  At least when I play lone star, the match feels relatively under my control.
---
5k players can have skill- every 5kbplayer ever. Skill is large factor in trophies, especially when you usually play with randoms. Also, yeah leon might be able to beat shelly, how ever, like I said shelly wins most the time easily. Also, with bandaid  she is quite good in almost any map for show down. You probably just can't dodge lmao.
---
Yep. We need a report system... Had someone collect 11 gems and then proceed to run straight into the enemy team while I desperately tried to save him. After he gave them all the gems he just kept running left and right at the bottom of the map refusing to participate.
---
why i feel that they want to bring the brawl talk and the update on the same day?
---
Why do you have jessie at power 1?
---
Great animation. I was just playing hem grab and had a bunch of bad fandoms and AFKs.
---
So then choose your battles better.
---
I have seen them on posts that are 3 minutes old
---
If you can have solo and duo showdown, why not duo takedown?
---
The pipers are like this as well
---
Hey 11year old stfu u know im right with ufake laughing ur still useless sooooo ya have a creature of the night under ur ved tonight

Yes, very "original" work
---
That's part of the model I think
---
I, as a true anti-teamer, team with them just to kill them right after
---
He did made a video tho and unlike cryingman who just showed the good clips from his matches vs low opponents with no actual gameplays he got to rank 35 not with being god at colt but with pushing with the most 2 broken brawlers in the game like pre nerf sandy and bibi however the thing this guy did is something that almost anyone can do and he prove it he was the 1st in his whole server who does that and most of them start pushing after him i asked some of rank 35 colts in lb and they all mentioned him you don‚Äôt have to be good at colt but still winning and getting the 1st place is hard af 90% of players who push there even stop at 1k or get stuck and lose hope 1.1k it‚Äôs a lot more harder than 3v3 and take much longer
---
And iT is the Home of Gene
---
Lol ok
---
Once you get above 700 cups takedown is literally just a dps race lol. Everyone just focus the boss and hardly attack each other. It's literally just shooting a boss every game. I haven't pushed to 1k so I don't know how hard it gets but I've heard from alot of players it's easy cups. And dude are you seriously trying to say crying man isn't good? Yes he plays with good teammates  but he doesn't get carried lmao. If he gets carried than why was his team in the world championship? You wouldn't be if you only get carried.
---
Post this on r/softwaregore
---
Jessie is fucking broken as Mega brawler
---
I wasn't the one to post there
---
Also, Many people draw these full body fusions here
---
Its also basically same idea except more effort
---
What is OCD???
---
Romanian flag?
---
how can i not dodge? what did i say that lead you to say that? you're more toxic than a barrel from chernobyl, jesus christ. yes, skill is a factor, but for all you know those randoms may be carrying.
---

Oh yeah that never really happened to me, one time my team just couldnt run away from the enemy base or enemies

Apparently I was wrong :P 
---
Let's see what Supercell is planning for Brawl Talk not to arrive today...
---
Yaaaay fellow mortis lover
---
These people piss me off. I reported one to supercell with lots of replay footage and they just told me to take a break. It‚Äôs annoying how supercell doesn‚Äôt punish that kind of behavior at all even if there‚Äôs proof. But what can ya do?
---
The Prize is Nice
---
u/reportsleuthbot

i actually love this.
---
Hell yeah
---
Lol 69 funny this deserves r/shittybrawlstars

I though maybe 1380, 1340, 1300, 1260
---
r/usernamecheckout

Lol you could have at least mentioned that the skin you drew isn‚Äôt yours
---
like a ton of people (me aswell) :/
---
ikr, that's unfair
---
Welcome to the group
---
I mean you're right
---
20k wtf???
---
Thanks for believing in MeüòÅ
---
Musica proprio a caso
---
U r not alone..... I also didn't get that
---
That's amazing owo
---
Dude ive drawed it
---
Why in the world would anyone do that?! They loose teophies and risk being banned. I see people like this at 500 trophies... at that level you probably care a minimum about the game.
---
Tbh you really are pretty toxic
---
r/brawlrecruit
---
Let The cute consume you
---
But the skin concept isn‚Äôt yours
---
hahaha.. i expected it to be the yellow monkey staring meme,.. but this is awesome and more relatable XD..
---
Only if your teammates are not dumbs
---
Only you??? I waited for that brawl even since i was born
---
A token doubler is literally just 10 boxes that take a lot to get, this offer is just 10 boxes one gem off, which you get right away, and no, your chances arent greater if you open 10 small boxes instead of 1 mega, it increases or is used  the same.
---
hAhA hA fUnNY
---
Dang I just caught an amazing fanart in new! This is amazing, keep it up!
---
Ikr. Like imagine being salty over a game lmao
---
I think you should have put a post flair before posting.
---
Better than BRAWL BOX*
---
Upvote
---
I think it's fake, it would be cool, but it's too much for an actualization
---
yes
---
She's also a minor
---
Holy .... incrediblle
---
Damn
---
Matchmaking is also based on total games won I think. It gets better as you win more games since your randoms will also have more games won, increasing the chance they will be good
---
Yellow Monkey? :D Its Heavy from TF2 with cosmetic called "Chicken Kiev"
---
That means" What brawler needs a skin?"
---
I saw that when i cNcelled but i didnt think wad 999 at all
---
I Still spam play Showdown, I have played it so much to the point where I basically only play showdown, that's not a good thing nor is it the best way. I am so convinced that if I play any other mode than I will lose mass trophies and not gain anything. Any Tips?-Not like there is any
---
Good to hear ! :D
---
&gt;And with a community like this, the game is going to get nowhere.
---
Oh wow!!! People prefer old music instead of the current mainstream music!! They're the reason why society is shit and therefore should be executed!!!
---
&gt;I'm not forcing this opinion on anyway, yet you've chosen to bring this to a personal level.
---
Yet you're implying that they should get with the times if they like Ricochet.
---
ooo.. sorry i didnt knew it..but thanks for letting me know...:D
---
Might be a surprise! They might be thinking to surprise us but we already know whats coming and when it is coming lolüòÇ
---
Agreed. Got Tara from one.
---
Coach Cory: 10/10
---
Oloco hein, :v
---
Yeah I am thinking the same since the update is gonna be huge one. Also they might introduce something regarding clubs.
---
Nooo
---
I still need to collect all the stars power üåöüíî
---
You could of added it in the title
---
That would be epic!
---
This is not how upvoting works
---
Some stuff seem fake, like 5v5 Takedown, trophy road expansion and "steallar" brawlers (Frank said in the Q&amp;A, that there will be no 5v5 anytime soon, also, he said that there are no plans on extending the trohpy road)
---
Wait,i posted this here by a mistake,i wanted to post this in r/okbrawlerretard,sorry
---
Are we sure that the update will be on the 12th?
---
If the new brawler is of lower rarity, then might not be a waste. Also I might get few starpowers if not a brawler then.
---
Lol true üòÇ
---
I checked it out but it's seems not. I update it and now it's seemingly fine, I only get it two times after the update. And other games are perfectly working without a single similar problem.
---
I know but only to mention to creator my opinion
---
Same Im with 100 normal qnd 7 big
---
No problem
---
I think thats a possibility, alyhough weve been
---
ok and?
---
Good job
---
Late....
---
You never waste your gems by buying one of these because you always get some Power points and gold. You guys just can't deal with it when you don't get automatically all legendarys and 3 star powers for one mega box
---
Please play more solo mode..
---
You can choose your own way to play..
---
And, if you still lose... Idk..
---
Pumba will repost this
---
Am i the only who see jojo reference in the word nice?
---
Better waet
---
we are done for...
---
r/lootstars
---
yeah but the meta is way closed, not all brawlers are good and there's the teaming part that takes out the fun of the game
---
Read the frickin' rules Dude
---
Not the only one
---
Yeah they might add something special like that. Even CR had added clan wars on their first anniversary.
---
This is fake
---
1- They already state that they wont expand thropy road because only 1% of BS players are above 15k so theres no point for it
---
2- 300k SP for a brawler? BS is a competitive game they wont do these type of things as you can see even when they release a new legendary they put it on the shoo the first day
---
3-Again they already said they wont do things for club since is hard to think and do
---
4- Lone Star and Takedown was supposed to be only solo events also in the Korea talk they say that 5vs5 is hard to do since would be so messy and had to balance almost all brawlers
---
So yeah these "leaks" are fake
---
Prepare to get
---
*S P I K E D*
---
Dude ok ik but why does everyone do that
---
Oh yea its not yours
---
Nope
---
And more 
---
Why
---
Obama giving himself a medal
---
Im confused
---
him means the autor‚Äôs name
---
WE ARE WE ARE
---
#YOUTH OF THE NATION!
---
100%
---
I hate Lone Star. Imo the least competitive game mode besides takedown
---
Should've waited for the Christhmas Skins (They are limited and maybe they will be VERY good)
---
This happen to me in powerplay
---
Shut up or i wish bad luck to u
---
Emz after she sees this:HUH!??!?!
---
yeah, you are right but the another guy is talking about the name of the autor
---
In the Q: and A: the dev's said that they aren't prioritizing stuff with clubs yet. They also said thay dont have an official idea on what to do with clubs.
---
Should probably edit the video so that the names are less visible, if that is your goal.
---
Left? Idk. Hopefully more than 6 but not more than 60.
---
Its ironic
---
Luck I have 809 trophies and start match 
---
The matchmaking 
---
My team:809 me 122 and 68 randoms 
---
Enemy team:1008,965 and 810
---
Tell me you have 20000 trophies right now
---
I agreeü§Ø
---
Those guys are the Biggest trash
---
Lose
---
Nice map. Although it would be really easy to lock up people in the middle.
---
This is what a blind person sees while playing Brawl Ball
---
How about quests then like in CR and COC ?!
---
I thought matchmaking had some links but was at least decent... Boy am I wrong
---
Your drop rate for legendaries increases every like 30-40 boxes. Maybe you are lucky and opened 30 boxes already and you will see a difference.
---
It‚Äôs not broken it could be used for lefty‚Äôs or righty‚Äôs
---
Ah shit here we go again
---
YES YES YES YES YES
---
Maybe, the dev's should add that, but they didn't say anything about it.
---
u/hellgirl_x3 post link https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawl_Stars/comments/e89ehn/3_hours/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
Killing people in takedown is normal
---
But only if you not making it the sense of your living
---
i think that‚Äôs exactly right. It does give you an advantage
---
I've been saving brawl boxes for so long, I just want to open them
---
None of which are possible for an actual player
---
i think we need more healing tbh
---
I actually don't care about it
---
The game was just mistake of nature 
---
No need to press f
---
Bot Colt??
---
I once got Sponge from Mega box.
---
Wow that's crazy.
---
69 funny give me upvot
---
ZEHAHAHAHA
---
 Ot even 100 boxes, weak.
---
\*1.000.000 star points
---
Yes I could
---
Yeah plz
---
Oof. I felt unlucky having pulled my second legendary in May and not having Sandy yet. That‚Äôs rough.
---
700
---
Yes i know it was too repetitive but I‚Äôm sorry to see SC killing a game
---
I didn‚Äôt read all of that, but I think Supercell tries to improve the game. Slow and steady
---
Yes i am
---
Then rename it Lone stars
---
watch the Q&amp;A
---
-No new brawler
---
-possibly something involving the matchmaking system
---
Why they dont rename it Lone stars
---
Yes. Season ends in a few hours
---
Only brawler I ever got from a mega box was Mortis. The rest were from the regular boxes
---
What‚Äôs your legendary chances?
---
How do you know that?
---
Oh, hi there!
---
That was the most intense game ive ever seen. Well done
---
Wanna know what I want..? My first legendary. Atleast below 15k pleaseeee supercellll :(
---
Hi fellow romanian
---
They did right choice
---
#autocorectoru'
---
shut up and take it
---
Wow
---
Nah
---
they should be in the very rare category
---
Star shelly is a little bit of rare now
---
Are there any informations or predictions when the new BT and the update will be released?
---
I like it
---
AH!!
---
Good to know.  Thanks for clarifying that!
---
Much appreciated!  :-)
---
If I have star points ending in 5, as the last digit and I get 25 star points from this season of power play, it will then end in a zero. I will then have zero as the last digit
---
In that case, I'm glad I got him (Sally Leon))
---
Yea, I've got crow and im Happy with that. Trying to push It to 1000 in showdown but It's really hard xd
---
Yeah but not everyone is gonna follow that. Op gave a better idea
---
True.
---
Or just remove it from the game to make Mortis great again
---
Removed.
---
Rule 5. Repetitive or low effort posts with a low discussion potential will be removed.
---
Lol
---
And they're downvote bombing this thread, but more people are annoyed by them than there are them
---
That first choice should not be an option.
---
Sorry replace crow with piper
---
Ofc

Rule 7. If you want to recruit for your band or are looking to join a band, post in r/BrawlRecruit.
---
They are not stealing nothing this is just a coincidence (like in most cases and even if this is true is not that bad and maybe is inspiration)

its a game you should play

reddit described with just one screenshot
---
That‚Äôs not how it works. If you open ten brawl boxes, each one of them has a 1% for star power. That doesn‚Äôt mean you multiply it, it stays 1% even at the 10th box. If I open 100 boxes, the 100th box will still be a 1% chance of star power. Same with legendaries except luck is involved.
---
Oui

Are we supposed to save them?

If your new look at me how young i am in redit and not every meme have to be the same trying new things is to good

The ladder isn‚Äôt competitive dude. Most true competitive players don‚Äôt trophy push anymore because it‚Äôs insanely easy to push and when you do get to true competitive levels matchmaking takes forever. Everything you say makes you sound like an entitled asshole. Also, supercell offers them for half off plus a skin about once every 4-6 weeks. Quit. Whining.
---
in the corea Q%A ? if so the video was filmed before the tiny update and there are a brawler offer in the game files now
---
You forgot the line skins
---
in the comments of the Q%A Dani precised they did that Q&amp;A BEFORE the "tiny" update so they maybe changed their mind about it in 1 and a half month
---
Yooo same. I nearly had a heart attack
---
Bad logic. In that argument people wouldn't be able to enter competitive ladder for upwards of 4 years until they have all the brawlers to push. How exactly am I impatient, do you really believe that gaining a legendary brawler once a year (if that) is fair paced? I'm not impatient I've waited long enough, the odds are just skewed
---
Its not going to but its a major flaw that limits their competitive gaming potential, its a shame at that
---
Di-8bit-ees
---
So close
---
10% is not that high and everyone I know didn't unlock their first legendary after maxing out every brawler so I'm not even sure what you said is right
---
Same :(
---
I think most people team at low trophies because they think that everyone sucks so they have 2x the chance of winning
---
It does not look like Spike right?I know I tried...
---
No, because of duo star
---
Shadow whealm
---
Most people down there do really suck and if everyone sucks except you then there is really no need to team but idk
---
You are also 11 soooooo...
---
Band aid isn't as good as yo uh make it out to be
---
I just fucking realized that
---
I knew it, it was the brawl stars cactus
---
Hey I did not say anything about your boy. I said it about my boy
---
For gems
---
Waw
---
Band aid has saved me in many situations in showdown. Especially against lower level Shellys who don‚Äôt have it.
---
Is this a CFOP algorithm?
---
I dont Think hat morti coubt ha skin eince you dont need to bug it or to supercell ID
---
 So you‚Äôre saying this is reposted? You‚Äôre still defending your point with no evidence? This meme format doesn‚Äôt seem cropped, looks like the original template.
---
Come on you play with randoms at 300 trophies what do you expect
---
We don't know yet if we will have an update or brawl talk on the 12th
---
0
---
Breh
---
Correct
---
That's because when u team they joined my club then invited me
