Leon

I clicked on it and I clicked that I already have brawl stars but it doesn’t take me anywhere and that’s why I asked you to share the team room code =D
---

I've got a habit of hitting that play again button

I'm at 7k trophies and still don't have any mythics legendary or even all the epics

---
Same. Only Morris and no legendaries.

When look for a transparent image, don't include "transparent" in the search bar. You can configure the search settings when searching images to only look at transparent images.
---
It looks funny as hell
---
I m like 1+month without any good reawrd.
---
got 1 brawler lvl 9 and 0 legendary
---
14k trophy
---
the game is just boring atm.
---
Unfortunately supercell did buff crow because the reddit was going like this, and look at crow now. Crow is a ranged brawler, but mortis is melee. Crow can drive enemies off, mortis cannot. However buffed mortises attack power can be, his reload and attack speed will always limit him to non-melee characters including shotgunners
---
Randoms are ass most of the time
---
You forgot to add a mouth on Leon
---

I have started playing Supercell games since elementary school. The first Supercell game I played was Clash of Clans. In fact, I still play the game today. When Clash Royale was announced I was global going global was very excited. I pre-registered for the game. Unfortunately, I lost interest in Clash Royale and stopped playing the game. Brawl Stars was global I was excited to play the game because I waited for  Brawl Stars to release before it was announced that it was even going global. I also pre-registered for Brawl Stars too and told my friends about the next Supercell game. Right now I am playing Brawl Stars daily and waiting for the next update. My player tag is #8GY9P9Y8.
---
Pam i guess
---
Sorry it took me so long to respond no I think it's also people just stopping and maxing every brawler I very much had time to get to 700 but I was basically trying to get 500 with brawlers I hate.
---
Bandaid def needs a buff don’t @me
---
HES AT 3500 YOUR AT 14500 WHY WOULD HE THINK YOU WOULD WANT TO PLAY WITH YOU DOES UE HAVE A LEVEL 10 IF NOT THEN NO
---
i'm at 6K, i only need mortis, spike boy and leon

Now with style!

**Chapter 1: the beginning**
---
Whay back in March of 2016 my friend told me about a new game, Clash Royale, we played "together" (because way back then the game didn't had 2v2) i always liked this game, i was addicted, but considering i was actually 8 years old i only managed to get 400 trophies, i wasn't that good at all...
---
**Chapter 2: trying out new games**
---
When i was 9 i started searching for other Supercell games, i found out Clash of Clans and Hay Day, that i enjoyed really much, then i started playing all 4 Supercell games, i was talking about it to all my friends and family members to play with them too...
---
**Chapter 3: Brawl Stars announcement**
---
When i discovered about Brawl Stars in soft launch i was like, literally **HYPE OVERLOAD** i am Brazilian but i had access to a Canadian account at play store and so i started to play...
---
**Chapter 4: finding love**
---
Brawl Stars was (and still is) my favorite games, i was 10 and a half at the time so i wasn't so good, i played when it was vertical and we used elixer...
---
**Chapter 5: GLOBAAAAAAL**
---
I watched the "we need to talk" stream, i was afraid of it going deleted, but also hyped if it got global, and when it launched here on Brazil i Started playing straight away...
---
**Chapter 6: aftermath**
---
I am now 13, i play Brawl Stars every day and spend a whole ton of money, cause, i love supporting my favorite games, and now a am in 14200 Trophies
---
P.S: i know it was long but, it is my story resumed, if you read all the way to here, thank you,
---
With love,

Buen dibujo y buena idea
---
I started playing clash royale in 2016 and it was super fun to play. When Brawl stars started in 2018 I couldn't resist to try another Supercell game and I loved it. I quitted CR because of the lack of time and now I'm a casual player at BS :)
---
  #CQQQGVGV
---
None of my trophy's road mega boxes had something great, but I'm extremely lucky with the regular boxes, in 14k btw
---
Oh wrong video  i meant the one where there was 9

The last sentence was pretty good ngl
---
I know too

OP
---
I just honestly hate this kind of system
---
Maybe?
---
Dude stop spamming this
---
Not really tho because I know a guy that spent money on the game a month a ago and still hasn't pushed an accountb past 1k trophies.  I do agree that someone who plays a ton and spends money is more dedicated then someone who just plays a bunch tho.
---
I started playing Clash of Clans in mid 2013, and I still play!
---
3 years later, CR was released and it probably still is Supercell's most successful game.
---
I only discovered Brawl Stars this year, but I really enjoyed the interactiveness more then CR's strategy.

# #880PYL8LR
---
Correction, just over 5500
---
Yes I want that too happen I have been playing for awhile and I have no legendary I have very brawler except the legendary and I just reach 4000
---
It doesn't suck, a player who plays a few times q day would take years like u said.
---
A player who plays around the clock will reach 12k before then like me.
---
I would be the more dedicated one.
---
He he I got 0.0528 for legendary fun times
---
Same bro, mines at .2 now smh and I'm at 5500 trophies...
---
Hope you guys like it!
---
Me and my friend are at 13000 with no Leon, he is the only brawler we don’t have, our other friend with 800 trophies has Leon it’s so dumb😂 needs to be fixed man
---
Level and trophies. More towards levels
---
I'd vote for no one
---
Why should they? Dude took Supercell's creation applied it on to another Supercell creation and made it his own creation. Creative, sure, but not something that the company wouldn't have come up with eventually especially considering their track record with crossovers. Not hating though.
---
What was the explanation for removing it ?
---
Yeah.. like he said above, don’t expect any legendaries for where you are at right now.
---
Levels not trophies
---
The right one looks better in my opinion
---
Basically because of my cousin :p
---
now I love them all.
---
Tag #2JGG2UC8

Dude i play from global, 11400 trophies, and my legendary chance got to 0.14 or higher once, and still no legendaries, so stop complaining about jo legies

No thanks
---
If u haven’t seen anyone do this yet, then you must not have been browsing YouTube or reddit for a long time.
---
Yes, but it takes hard work and concentration.
---
Looks normal to me.
---
So teaming
---
Too many 1 tile gaps. Looks pretty empty. Middle is spammable and is basically s chokepoint for any team trying to grab gems.
---
Man you scared me at first
---
Bro did you try to compliment yourself?
---
Too crowded, too many one tile gaps. Easily spammable by throwers. Middle is s chokepoint.
---
In beta I used to team but today I see it as people are to chicken to go solo
---
Shelly Star Power is more OP
---
Carl gang
---
&gt;Is only a simple idea, answer to all: The duration is 1 week Anybody can participate All members who aport 50 crowns gets the reward if the clan reach it I don't know why crowns, I only wanna be original
---
It's a simple idea but not original. It's a CR clan chest clone.
---
¡Muy bonito! Es la clase de skin que yo compraría (si tan solo tuviera gemas x,d)
---
But, recuerda postear en inglés, ya que al menos el 99,9% de este Reddit se maneja en inglés (y eso me obliga a comentar en inglés xd)
---
Me too
---
Wow calm down, Obviously I can't do good money or that, I'm on phone lol
---
so just to be clear, screeching solo is supposed to go through walls?
---
That was kinda the point but 1 tile knock back for the ball wouldn't buff defense that much. Might not even notice it
---
10k7 trophies, 0.16 legend rate, and I still got no Legends.
---
Hmmm... John Cena used to be famous and now people don't talk about him much now like how Leon's invisible?
---
I wish there were more people like us in the world
---
I mean, I have 4 level 10 Brawlers, 5 star powers, and a level 9. I’ve not spent s single cent.
---
But he has pouch.
---
At 1k total trophies too
---
BIBI:am I a joke to you
---
I love this!
---
Lol what? There has never been an issue with the luck system. Sure it might take a lot of time to get this brawler or that brawler but it happens. You guys just want the game to be easier and easir as you go on? Come on don’t be ridiculous like this whole post
---
Who's that pink-haired girl next to Piper?
---
Everybody asks about Bibi, but where's mah planty gurl
---
I remember before 4 years my classmates want to make clash of clans clan for the class do they told m to download the game and I actually like it I didn't though that one day I might someone might convince me to play this game then clash royale come out I start playing more and more then when the android release I started playing brawl stars
---
#GROY9G8V
---
I am at 8200 trophies and haven't gotten a single mythic or legendary, meanwhile my friends are at like 5k and already have 2 legendaries.
---
Think ive seen this before

8/10 solid edits. I find some edits here and here out of context and some others that could be added at certain moments. Overall good job.

What if her name is Morgan and she is Mortis's twin sister

A friend of mine tried that and he got shot by colt with his super.

I unfreinded him :D
---
Token capacity was 100 before global, for me 200  is enough
---
My first match with Gene was on Heist, i still won btw :v
---
Sadly, life isn’t fair :(
---
Probably facing teamers and the energy drinks don't spawn near them
---
No i dint 🤔
---
U won anyway soo that brock has skill and that matters too
---
Ok sure
---
Thanks
---
It's shining soo much
---
No he plays earrape megalovania
---
Yes. It's unfair that 1k f2p players can get 2 legendaries, and 10k players are still dreaming of their first legendary.
---
This is not free stuff.
---
Thank you very much
---
Lmao 5k is low
---
I started playing supersell games in 2016, my first game was clash royale, I played it at school at recess and at home, later I started playing clash of clans, but when I reached 8 TH, I abandoned it. in June 2018, I downloaded brawl stars to my android smartphone, play to this day, I really like supercell games, I would like a skin on Karl! My tag: #GGJ8L9RQ
---
The first Supercell game I have ever played was of course Clash of Clans another game that I highly been appreciated of. Due to that and the popularity I started playing Brawl Stars and have been playing since the Beta all the way to the global release

You got it if you are :3 (nice clan btw 😉)
---
Its my opinion calm down. Also, saying nerd is irrelevant now.
---
I see this as a great idea, but at the same time it would decrease the value of the Epic, Mythic and Legendary Brawlers.
---
Dude you broke their ankles so hard I bet they had to go to the hospital
---
So sad.
---
Supercell: the higher you progress on the trophy road, the better rewards you'll earn.
---
Also Supercell: at around 5k trophys you will earn 150 coins and at about 7k you will get 50 coins.

We'll get u in Hot!!!

---
Why haven't i thought of this before?
---
It probably won't come for another 2  weeks or so though, since some of the star powers still haven't been added yet
---
I think you’re thinking too much about Rosa getting countered by Bull and Primo, ofcourse she’s the underdog when we’re talking about Heavyweights, but against ranged brawlers, she’s extremely annoying to deal with. Her kit focuses on controlling the map with her super and range... which was my main point that you fail to see. That’s why I said she can out live Colt and Rico which are known for busting tanks.
---
Stop saying scenarios that happen on solo showdown, Bull and Primo are much less of a threat on team fight maps. Maybe except BrawlBall.
---
Never gonna happen cause it doesn't make enuf money
---
Say what ever you want. She is still op in my eyes
---
All of them are too open and dont promote much diversity in general besides long range brawlers, and the bottom maps have too many unnecessary bushes that seem to be there just for tanks, if you want to help out tanks add cover, not a stupid amount of bushes. And try making non symmetrical Showdown maps, they're much more interesting when it comes to gameplay
---
Wish I could upvote but the upvote count is at 69, so... sorry
---
I think all your maps worth 10 by 10!
---
I don’t think this is a good idea
---
You are the true brawler 😿😿

I started playing supercell games in 2015, and I started off with boom beach. Played it because my friends played clash and I knew I'd never catch up to them, so I decided to grind out boom beach. Now I play clash of clans and brawl Stars, and have been playing brawl Stars since global. Better than all my friends now lol, all that work paid off in the end.
---
thinking of piper
---
That would make it very tough at higher trophy levels. I’d be fine if I was never in a game with anyone below 10k(I’m at 18k)
---
They need to weight total trophies AND they need to stop letting parties of 2 queue into 3v3s. Duos is a thing. Either find a 3rd, play duos, or queue in solo. 90% of the time I get matched with people sub 2k, they’re partied with some dumb 10k+ friend or club member who’s trying to carry them.
---
Rifleman colt, farmer poco, somthing with darryl?
---
Lol
---
Some factors of team fights that might be new to you:
---
*Positioning, dodging, having teammates*
---
What Bull and Primo do in teamfights, Rosa can do it much better.
---
you asked if you are good and based on your tropies you are not.
---
You know it bro, ive been saved like this a couple of times too🤧
---
Ok thanks for your time
---
Then why wasn't this post deleted?
---
Nice
---
I mean I thought of this
---
The projectile is different its hammer but thats just part of the skin
---
The effects are the same
---
But still
---
Same here but with only 1 Legendary, but it does make sense since on a certain month I'm not sure what month it was, the game was generous and just gave me Brawlers Galore in less than a week.
---
Let's not ignore the fact  that OP's idea is bad
---
Yeah I agree someone even had the crap idea to lock legendaries for low trophy players
---
I dont even know
---
Thats what they did with star points
---
Star points rewards active players
---
Previous token rewards just rewards even if u didn't played that season
---
*cough* EA...
---
"Positioning" u mean lanning right?
---
"Dodging" what are u trying to say? I cant dodge? Tanks are bigger targets so they are easier to hit, and if your piper is anything like mine u will gather second star power.
---
"Having temaates" u think I only play showdown? Because that's what I'm getting from this lol. My fav modes are gg and bb, then showdown, then bounty.
---
I dont play siege at all (fuck that star token) 
---
"What bull and primo do, rosa can do better" explain.
---
Please do.
---
Wait till squirrel Leon shows up
---
So we back in the mine
---
There was even a time where supercell had legendaries for sale
---
I want hog rider carl so badly
---
Can we just be happy for 7 years of clash?
---
Yes
---
Thats why they are avoiding as of rn
---
I took the  survey
---
is this the wrong screenshot?
---
With skins as well
---
I remember when Spike was 500 gems with Robo Spike while Crow was chilling there at 600 gems with a Mecha Crow skin
---
The only exception was Leon but I remember they dropped his gem price dramatically from 700 though
---
Ah, gotcha thanks!
---
;( Ik ima just love 250 star points...
---
This happened to me ! But the person had a 500 Rosa, typical
---
Thanks man
---
yro'ue*
---
It's ok don't call yourself stupid
---
Ah it all makes sense now
---
Why is everyone hating?
---
Adapt Overcome
---
Sorry
---
Not sure thats the worst thing
---
Sorry i dont get it can you explain it to me thx
---
Dude.. At 9200 trophies I don't have any mythics..
---
This is why I just quit playing the game. Been playing this game for a year and I still didn't have any leggys. It's tiring and it's not worth the time to me rn
---
Not sure about this
---
Thanks just sometimes I am I’m really tired it’s like 3:00
---
It does has a visual glitch
---
Lul
---
Imagine thinking all dynamike die to Mortis
---
*i see you are a man of culture aswell*
---
xdd
---
Yup, sorry
---
If you’re quick enough while entering a new matchmake, you can hit exit while the other 8 players are loading.
---
What?
---
That would be great yet supercell will never implement it
---
Is not pink, thats how the red looks on the light :'3
---
Yup, forgat about rosa to
---
You play A LOT of BrawlBall
---
No
---
You think?!!

Started back in January this year with Brawl Stars after I saw the "No Time to Explain" video in an Instagram ad. I became addicted and then decided to give other Supercell games a shot. Clash Royale is probably my second favourite Supercell game.

---
Map is not symmetrical, unfair
---
To all the people commenting wholesome and how he’s such a gentleman, just remember that instead of killing the piper, he decided to team with her for the rest of the game. Your ‘act of kindness’ created an unfair playing experience for other players in the game. Yes, teaming is allowed, but does that make it right?

No it not that my friends and u have been playing for a while but we keep in losing because every match the enemy team all have star power and they beat us easily me and my friend are free to play player at very high trophies
---
I have to agree this is what we need
---
That sucks
---
True but why would they play a level 1 nita who have 45 trophies while the other 2 had between 8,000-9,000

---
You're unlucky. Have you ever completed micro transactions in brawl stars? That could be the reason, once you put money in it supercell will want to steal all your money so it doesn't give you brawlers from free crates, and it obliges you to buy them. I have almost all cards at 4000, instead of Gene, Leon and spike.

This would be a 30 gem skin

It depends what game mode you are playing him with, in gem grab you would use him as a gem carrier, usually swoop in and take all of the gems and maybe help finish off enemy players. In showdown, you would play Mortis in close range maps, such as “Rockwall Brawl” (my favorite map and only map I play with Mortis). Mortis in showdown would be used to take out weak enemies, steal power cubes from other players, and once you have enough power cubes, you could then be aggressive with him. For Mortis, it would be good if you went against other brawlers such as Dynamike, Barely, Tick, Rico, Colt, Poco, penny, Frank, Bibi, Piper(if your close enough). Do not go up against any tanks or shotgunners, they will destroy you, only take them on if you are have more power cubes and they have low health. When taking on another brawler, sneak up on them or bush camp and wait for them to come close, then attack. If you are getting heavily damaged by another brawler, use your dash attack to get out of the situation and heal up. I hope this information helps you with Mortis, Seeya.

I start play clash royale in 2018…2019 March, I found out brawl star is also a fun game so I play alot.
---
I'd rather think that Bo found the cub with it's dead momma and so he decided to train Bruce to be with Nita instead of what OP said ;-;
---
And i found a better way, u can just use colt's new star power it just infinite long range no need to wait it to charge(and the bibi mortis glitch charging up is bibi's time not mortis's time so it saves time
---
I'm mad at Supercell for adding stupid skins and not doing anything about this. It's obviously broken and they're just sitting on their asses.

Looks like carl is also going to get the give all skins to Brock fever

There was a metà where in showdown throwers teaming was out of control, 10 people teaming each other, games full of dyna and barley. Cannot use other brawlers. Supercell deleted stormy plains for this BS.

personally i think the usage of slick boots is very limited compared to some other star powers. it may be useful in some cases sbut its definitely not one of the best star powers. it will be very powerful to top colt players though.

For his versatility in Gem Grab alone: Yes. But he isn't as great as some other players in some other modes to justify A tier imo.

This. this is thr exact same reason why siege is now bad.

Agreed. I was just going by his super considering his head is on his body. But yea 3000 would be pretty devastating. I like the 500-600 range seems balanced.

Hey brawlers,SuperCell and players i create a mega map for brawl stars!

Mortis needs an indirect buff. If all the tanks are out of the meta, Mortis will thrive, so most tanks need to be nerfed (especially Bibi lol).
---
Cool
---
It will probs always be that way due to how spike's mechanics work.

This just happened to me yesterday with my friends.

---
me 1.400 but dont get any legendary this system is S
---
It took me 10 mins to realize the pattern on his eyes
---
"Mortis will thrive" the definition of thrive is: prosper; flourish.
---
If u nerf tanks, shelly will be even more broken. And mortis is balanced. U just need to nerf shelly base.
---
Because if u buff mortis, u will have to buff the brawlers hes already good against. So it's a fair fight.
---
It's rare to find skin ideas for pam not many people do them but awsome job
---
I pushed spike and tara today to rank 20
---
Shelly is really underperforming WITHOUT star power in the competitive meta
---
So bandaid nerf will put her down, shes not op at all
---
And bibi ront need a nerf, wtf? Tired of people saying this because a youtuber did.

Well, Band-Aid being OP is true.

Started playing the game in September of 2017 and I couldn’t stop playing, this game always changes and is very diverse! The meta always evolves and it never gets boring to push. I also started played clash royale on November, 2016, and while the game involves a lot of strategy and is fun, it is way less free to play friendly than Brawl Stars. I love Brawl Stars and Supercell is probably the best mobile game company. I have one request though: please don’t implement a battle pass feature like that in clash royale and clash of clans.

I started playing Clash of Clans because my friends already played it and they wanted me in their clan. It was a really fun way to play a game collectively with friends, do clan wars or just chat. Soon I explored Hay Day too and when Clash Royal launched I knew I would be playing every single new supercell game as soon as they'd release them.
---
To my surprise Brawl Stars has quickly become my new favorite supercell game when it launched. The only thing I'm missing is a real purpose for clubs apart from chatting.

I now have two other brawler above 500 trophies.

No worries, i had really bad time with Mortis on lvl 1. No way to defend, only run there where other enemies could, and were hiding. It was like gambling. Or you dont get caught or wont get a bush with an enemy, or u get completely devastated by any random. He was my most painful 20 rank. Never touching him again until i get to lvl him. Or find a way to use him. 
---
And i have some advice to you if u leveling on showdown solo. Dont go hella fight. Dont attack if its not needed. Just try to hide. Get boxes around you and hide somewhere. On most of maps hiding in middle is really bad idea tho. Rushing on enemies will only bring more attention. Colt can defend. Mortis? No, especially lvl 1.

I know you can do better than that

That's what she said
---
How is this related to BS?

Definitely not. Spike has an attack spread which can easily control the map and push enemies back. Crow has low damage, mediocre spread, and really struggles to finish off brawlers. To top that, he is just as squishy as Spike.

My emotions cannot handle this. I am both overloaded with cuteness and confused and scared. Help.
---
Crow controls better than spike.
---
Spike has area denial.
---
Crow has *crowd* denial. All his teamates hea up faster than the enemies AND when they are hit, thier dmg is DECREASED. This changes everything despite 10% being a small number. Certain match ups will be null and void.
---
Crows reload is also faster than spikes. And he has a super that dives and does alot of dmg. Easily good in 3 v 3 s.
---
So no, hes not absolutely better. 
---
"Struggles to finish off brawlers" because hes not supposed to unless its showdown. And in 3 v 3s he does often finish them off. Wtf are u on about?
---
Yes, that seems logical.

#80RC80Y9P

If you wanna talk star powers, Spike’s new star power curves cancelling out that space denial. And if you aim it correctly, his super will prevent enemies from doing pretty much anything, while taking damage. And yes, it is hard to finish of brawlers with Crow, especially in 3v3s. Anyone with over 4200 health can take out Crow with ease. Go watch Lex’s Crow 1v1 video. Maybe that will clean your ears out.

SUPERCELL NEEDS TO PUT THIS ON CHRISTMAS UPDATE
---
No prob
---
are the bosses robots/AI because setting a bosses hp to 30000 would make tanky brawlers worthless because their hp wouldnt scale
---
Pipper burlesque, for example

It's a name. This is mit really contend. Many brawler have still different names in the code. What do mean with "space theme". I know brawl Stars origins but what do you mean?

I would have an opening in the middle of each parallel wall so you can funnel play into the rest of the map.
---
WE NEED THIS MAN HIRED FOR SUPERCELL
---
I will do more maps if i can
---
The percentage wouldnt add up to 100% due to the loss of health overtime

You would get about that much from a mega box anyways
---
You suck, try dodging

This event is way more fun than rumble true. But on an average you get 18 tokens, let's say. Then there's a difference of 12 tokens per ticket (assuming you're good enough to score 30 in rumble which is fairly easy) then that's a total difference of 480 tickets with doublers, or 240 without it. Pretty significant imo.

Well I didn't start drawing digitally until one month ago, and believe me, my first time digitally drawing was a mess: https://www.reddit.com/r/shellygang/comments/cd7di3/im_so_frustrated/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share ...but once you start and get used to it you'll see how much fun it is I encourage you to try it out!
