So like.. a boob?

I like me some boomerangs -w-

Thank you!
---
Why does he have no trophies?
---
Just checked, my Shelly is at almost 300 trophies while ricochet has literally 0, Shelly is power level 4, ricochet is 1.
---

---
Games with each have equal distribution of players ranked 3-5 and trophies ranging from 58-300 ...
---
I understand leaving the matchmaking limitations not too restrictive but 0-300 trophies? Levels 1-5? That‚Äôs pretty unfair.... and matchmaking timers take like 0 seconds so yeah I‚Äôm definitely willing to wait 5 seconds to play a fair match ...
---
It was a joke
---
Or maybe he is trying to get all his brawlers to rank 20 with power 1
---
Whats difference between 
---
Opacity and Transparency 
---
Is opacity how solid something is and transparency, how clear something is?
---
I‚Äôm at 15 Brawlers and at 5300 trophies
---
Don‚Äôt get cocky there‚Äôs loads of people on this subreddit who are better than us. Making a post trying to show off is stupid
---
Gonna post this everyday until I get a new brawler
---
Bladed blades. Really descriptive 
---
They don't play and those who do play at different moments of the day... is there any way to block those people who have this behaviour?
---
More like
---
LOS PRIMOS 
---
Wow üòÑüòÜ
---
Nice
---
Not being cocky, I am complaining about my bad luck lol... But you got even worst dude, F for you
---
Well the "edges" of boomerangs are called "blades" so I threw in a little pun.
---
el fuego looking dope 
---
The truth is painful.
---
that's the worst argument I've ever heard. You're comparing purpoself dispensable troops to an actual brawler who you control. 
---
Well .... no, I guess.
---
No. You can invite people on your friends list or ask for them to add you. You also got clubmates.
---
This ain‚Äôt Bull, why isn‚Äôt he in a bush then?
---
Darryl the barrel. Wow, I just figured that out.
---
Exactly what I thought 
---
Im never going to meet the legendaries
---
Storm?  Didn‚Äôt know this was Fortnite
---
What chance did you pull him? I‚Äôm waiting for 3/3 as well.
---
It looks like Pinhole Punt. It's got the square grass in the middle.
---
You can see them on the shop
---
Yeah the poisonous cloud was referred to as the storm in beta
---
U told me...i m nvr gonna to use it that much again...üòâ
---
'Teamers spin in showdown' 'suk'
---
Lovely story and art!
---
No, I don't want this to happen. I like how Brawl stars is so different from Clash Royale, Clash of Clans and Boom Beach. I want it to stay that way.
---
Not all heroes wear capes, some are shirtless
---
Yeah I'd buy that instantly lol.
---
More like Barley Team
---
This is so accurate it hurts
---
the real humor is that you said "smh my head"
---
When you get away from a fight with 3 health then Bo‚Äôs bomb starts ticking 
---
Yea. To keep it consistent. And it makes him look cool.
---
Team Bull is gross 
---
MFW (colt) I see this post
---
Exactly
---
Yes
---
What about Rico, Barrly, Darrell, spike, Leon, bo, Nita, Poco, penny, Pam, Tara, And mortis?
---
If you hide in a bush and get 10th place as bull you need to delete the app
---
Nitas nibble
---
It happens a lot. You can sometimes encounter a maxed out brawler as your enemy or as a teammate.
---
amazing idea
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
But where are all the bushes for Bull to camp in?
---
You're about 1% of every mobile gamer
---
lol do more
---
3 pictures paint a thousand words
---
Do it
---
No that's not the point. Look deeper to see the true meaning of the joke.
---
You do realize there are kids playing this game and the "scrubs" you're flaming are probably 7 years old or something.
---
Isn‚Äôt Bull Jessie‚Äôs dad though?
---
Bo magic archer skin
---
What..?
---
Its a pun, because eagles are birds, like crow
---
We talk about this at work for game UI. Things like HP, EXP bars etc. should always be presented in the same color, or it causes player confusion.
---
What about a Frank Nerf?
---
Wow. You went so low with that joke. You should be ashamed. There are a lot of vegans out there and you don‚Äôt make a funny joke out of that. 
---
It's the arrow that points down
---
I ment even more so sorry I should of been clearer 
---
It's not anymore, but in older versions of Brawl Stars from before the global release, Brawlers that are now trophy rewards could be found in boxes
---
Damn
---
I had like this same idea a while back. lol
---
There is a lot of good art in contention, and this is one
---
Can you dig it
---
That‚Äôs the point
---
Thanks. I am currently editing the video to add music 
---
That was my Mortis before the landscape update. I get him to 495, go to sleep because I was too tired to win anymore. That night was the update. I wake up, try grinding. Mortis now at 350. Now, just a month ago, I finally managed to get him back up to 500.

No, they want to make as much money as possible. They know damn well what they‚Äôre doing, they just aren‚Äôt doing the morally right thing.

According to the map creator, the walls are ‚Äútall‚Äù, which would stop that from happening

The sad truth

The Leon dad jokes just don't stop

This one touched my soul.

You really put a lot of thought into this. I like it!

But didn‚Äôt m vs m leave the game

Now i know why he has a gold skin

Yeah that happened to me and I still got the stuff

Literally everyone looks like from the game not some alien dude great job!
---
I‚Äôll report you then. Shit content like that plagues this sub
---
Thats my new background for now. Thanks!
---
Translate to English.
---
you just moved them from places and put a filter on them
---
So it‚Äôs common to get a legendary if you paid &lt;$20?
---
When I try to do that it says ‚Äúno flair available, flair disabled in this community‚Äù
---
I thought that the bot is asexual just like zenyatta
---
My buddy broke his phone and he bought a new one but does not have a super cell I'd linked to the old phone account. Is there a way around this to get his profile back?
---
L 
---
Bull needs a nerf?
---
Did you just quote torborn on me?
---
Why is that?
---
He's really strong in some game modes and a little over powering, but that's my opinion 
---
Photoshoppers will say it's hate
---
Depends on the brawler and what Thier ammo is at ie barly at 0 ammo will die unless there is a wall 
---
Nice drawing but why are there two Leon‚Äôs?
---
I love how you even did your profile pic as Leon tooüòÇüëåüèª
---
Why is Leon already on the map?
---
In casual they could do matchmaking based on team average rather than highest trophies so the matchmaking would be fair in that regard
---
You will only be able to buy one of each item, there will be only 3 items total each day and it will rotate every day. So no
---
Ah i see you making the plays( in this case Deals) of the century. Probs on you take my upvote
---
You‚Äôr teammates Leon is so high level
---
That poor Leon is about to get squashed 
---
That Leon‚Äôs really destroying me the safe
---
Thanks
---
They haven't finished developing them yet. There is a spot for them, implying that they're coming soon tho
---
How come you have an extra Leon as a teammate I call hacks 
---
I know this is not the topic, but tap-to-move feature would highly improve the ui. Both sticks really mess player's vision of the field. Play with one hand would also improve the experience. This is how I remember playing tap-to-move in the old Brawstars.
---
Working

---
Hope you guys like it
---
Yeah
---
Yeah he takes a while to get good with him but a good Mortis can totally dominate
---
i dont even have him
---
y tf am i reading this
---
I don‚Äôt really like the rework idea but I approve of buffing his super, if they buff his main attack he‚Äôll be broken, but if they buff his super he won‚Äôt.
---
I‚Äôd say just make his super charge faster and deal more damage while healing the same amount.
---
This way he‚Äôll be a bit harder to kill and able to do a bit more ranged damage if he charges it up.
---
Leon is Balanced he should have more helath because he dies to bull to easy or shelly with super im saying giving him a 10% helath buff.
---
Nice I just did the same thing today lol, all brawlers at 300
---
Are y‚Äôall stupid?
---
It‚Äôs bull or Shelly 
---
How do you know that Tara is a girl. Guys can have ponytails too
---
I have all my brawler maxes and to 500 but I don‚Äôt have  any legendaries and my percentage is above 0.24 so don‚Äôt feel bad bro  
---
I like the idea
---
I don't think they're looking for redesigns right now. Your time would be better spent on drawing fanart, skins or new brawlers (I've done one you should check it out). üëç
---
I‚Äôll use it
---
Thank you very much!
---
It looks like you took an image of all thoae brawlers from google and just made their colors fade and paste em on the brawl stars loading screen, I doubt to believe you drew this. 
---
As in the #7 would battle the other #7, for example, in a 1v1? 
---
I don‚Äôt understand how our odds are hat low. Mine are higher and I have every brawler.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure he means in duo‚Äôs
---
This is great art but I swear bull looked like a horse for a few seconds there üòÇüòÇ
---
Don‚Äôt worry. That percentage is insanely high. You‚Äôll get one soon enough.
---
Sad when u got 20 gems tho
---
Very unique map, it would be really cool if this was in the game but it wouldn‚Äôt happen because of the complexity of the map, and supercell keeps it simple, but this is so cool I wish I could play on it. 
---
Sans as a leon skin!
---
Or a btd6 boomerang monkey
---
Yes really want... At least 150 or 200 please
---
He (or she) means that there shluld be an option for joysticks stay always at their initial positions.
---
Basically every sd match
---
Then what would the point of powering up your brawler be if you‚Äôd be matched up with players at the same power level all the time?
---
The composition, characters, and colors!!! Soooo awesome üî•
---
You start to loss trophy after 30 trophies
---
Is that even a question?
---
Oh, The More You Know. Thanks for this information!

Thanks! What about solid yellow and solid blue?

It‚Äôs sad that I have to answer this, yes.
---
Well, EXCUSE ME if don't know the date of the launch in one country... For everyone else it was December so I thought it was same for everyone including Canada. 
---
You ain‚Äôt never raged at it before?
---
Yeah but not to this degree over a casual pay to win mobile game that I don‚Äôt spend money on :/
---
I salute you for not cracking your device
---
*X Doubt*
---
Yeah it‚Äôs weird, I don‚Äôt normally rage at games like I play CoD pretty level headedly but this game gets to me
---
Yes it's 2x value. Better than anything else that is not a value pack.
---
Taken idea kid dont lie saw it on youtube week ago
---
Well yes it's luck but when people complain about it, it's like they were all sure to get a legendary just because they reached an higher trophy record. But it's all wrong. 
---
When there‚Äôs a rotating circle around a brawler, red or blue, it means they have their super, when it turns yellow they are aiming their super.
---
There a chicken upset spicy mike
---
Why have you done this to yourself
---
I get why tho some losses are just Bs and you could spend 30 mins getting trophies and like 4 losses in 5 minutes can cancel it all out 
---
Half of the map is useless, and I don't think any gem grab maps have water.
---
A replay would be nice.
---
Besides the meme, who isn‚Äôt in awe at the size of that absolute unit?
---
She looks like a kid in game 
---
I think crows in a good spot where he is, he just takes skill. If anything maybe like a 3-5% damage buff would be fair, but like I said I think he‚Äôs okay the way he is.
---
Forget about lobbers, ricochet would be dominate 
---
‚Ä¶ no. I‚Äôve never seen this but I‚Äôve thought about it a lot and finally decided to draw it. I don‚Äôt claim to be the first to have this idea, it‚Äôs fairly easy for one to come up with. However, I know for a fact that I drew this and posted it before having any knowledge of someone having this same idea. 
---
It says replays currently disabled?
---
Ya true but he needs a bit more heath too 
---
I meant if you recorded it yourself.
---
Shit map tbh
---
I figured the main reason I lagged on showdown was either my phone is not good enough to run this game perfectly. Or it is because there are 9 other people my phone has to accommodate for cause whenever I play gamemodes with less people I run fairly smoothly. And it's very noticeable considering I actually feel like I move slower than the rest of the players while they are in real time beating me hardcore. 
---
Oh no I don‚Äôt record my battles, am I supposed to?
---
Echo Chambers and Flooded Mine: excuse me what the fuck
---
So I should get it?
---
Tbh no lol
---
Yeah that might be the issue, but I have a new phone now and it's fine.
---
Btw my legendary chance is 0.0912 and I have a deal in my shop for 109 gens for 2 mega boxes
---
Just... wow. You seriously deserve to win. 
---
I loved üíúüíúüíú‚ú®‚ú®
---
Right, but compare the amount of water here. You think it's necessary?
---
Just would be nice so we can actually see it.
---
It's an old idea not an old fanart
---
Fuk u
---
Worth it if you‚Äôre willing to spend money
---
Yeah exactly that, it‚Äôs sooo harsh, grind on a character for ages to go up a rank and then get teamed twice in a row and place tenth and your back where you‚Äôve started
---
Look on twitter, Frank answers every question ..
---
Learn his strengths and weaknesses and how to play properly against him.
---
This idea was suggestive in reddit around a year ago.
---
I don‚Äôt team tho

Or some say, Kosm
---
Poco is balanced though
---
I love ur style in making skins dude u r skins r awesome keep going

I just got back after playing terraria with friends for 5 hours straight. This is perfect timing

its based on your brawlers trophies

Yeah same I did to because I noticed that to it‚Äôs sad guess no legendary unless you buy mega boxes to increase your chancesüò≠

Ummm... Yeah, not gonna spend money on it, but as I‚Äôve no life I‚Äôll tryhard a bit to get some epics
---
it even sounds like him a little bit 
---
Three yt ers it is only chiefpat
---
Ye but that's still being unlucky, if u receive higher trophy road, chances are is that u have opened more boxes, as well as numerous mega boxes from trophy road
---
I honestly don't get why players do this. If someone gets all the gems, run the other way, I will be the one holding the fort, regardless if I get killed, as long as that person survives and gives us the win. But no, people want to take all the credit I guess.
---
I would assume impossible, since there are no star players in a draw

I'm still waiting for only 1 legendary...

No pls, no more maps where i can get lost D:
---
And?

I honestly only ever see his super used once per game.

---
30 gems only, please
---
Agreed crow is hardest than rico
---
Bull(bu)Sh?
---
Well I calculated that Leon attack does 2,800 damage  and colt's attack does 2,520 in total if all shots land, but still FIDGET SPINNERS WIN
---
Teaming is just part of the game.
---
You can fight against teaming by teaming yourself and then betray as soon as you can. This would make players more parano√Ød about it.
---
If you want SC to fix something just abuse of it then. I strongly suggest you to stop whining and start teaming in SD. Not in every match, but when you feel it is a necessity in order to survive.
---
Also, "maining" Shelly (or Bull/Leon/Primo) in SD is like asking to be ganked by teamers since she has a clear advantage against other brawlers in this mode.

And a mythic at that ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
That's it... Very useless, I know.
---
Yeah i think SC will totally agree to add a feature that say "You're a dumb monkey" to their customers :)
---
What would be nice tho it's to have detailed data after each match. Like Western Legends where you see : number of kills, number of assist and number of death.
---
This drawing was made by u/CoachFlapjack. If you like this, go check out his other drawings! Follow his insta too, I think that‚Äôs where he posts other drawings.
---
THAT IS SAD I PITY YOU
---
It's been a while, but here's a comp I would suggest for the next robo rumble.
---
"Dyna, Nita and Pam"
---
Huh? You may ask why... Pam can help recover health with her turret and is strong too...
---
But why other two?
---
Because of this Exploit!
---
You handle a few waves with Dyna and Nita, charge their super and go to the red mark. There, throw Dyna super and then Nita's bear in the opening. You do this again at the marked points and boom, you have a lot less burden to handle!
---
But, Why this works?
---
That's a really good question... 
---
This is because bots spawn at edges, at the black points marked, and will target nearest character. (that ain't a bot)
---
Since they can't access the bear, who's in the red spot, they will stay there only and won't move. 
---
How does this help?
---
It makes your burden a lot less. It also reduces the chance of facing a boss bot and increases chances of max reward!
---
Thanks for reading, peace ‚úåÔ∏è

They would need some improvement, but good job and amazing idea. I don't know if supercell care enough though, it's not gonna make them any more money ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
So strange
---
That‚Äôs why they need to fix matchmaking and make it somewhat more reliant on total trophies. It doesn‚Äôt matter how much you play primo you won‚Äôt understand the game as much when you‚Äôre at 430 total trophies so please get them out of my lobby and put them in a lobby where they are more evenly matched. It helps both my brain cells and helps them actually improve. ‚ÄúOh but what if people just one trick to 500‚Äù then they will be with other players like that so who cares. 
---
The game feels impossible to win unless you‚Äôre With a coordinated team of players on discord and that‚Äôs really frustrating to be forced into that.

Here's my Brawl Stars fan art :D

Why don't we get two star tokens with a token double effect? Tokens are tokens are they not?
---
No shit leon
---
Why would u post something straight from a google search tho 
---
How is the name offensive? 
---
That‚Äôs not offensive lol
---
The yellow beak below Tara‚Äôs mask 
---
Wtf dude just calm down
---
You can‚Äôt decide it‚Äôs offensive or not by your religion
---
Teaming isn‚Äôt that bad really, you know you can team up yourself right?
---
WHeRe iS MoRTiS HaT
---
I also got my bull to 495 trophies and thought one win then he'll be level 20 and then i kept losing til i was just 380 trophies
---
No

Timothy

Bartholomew

Henry

Turtle
---
Bird

Bob

Karen
---
James
---
Stacy
---
You should have spent $30 for the leon offer a week or two ago.
---
What is offensive about that name
---
Cuz he‚Äôs bad
---
Lol I bought him for 70 tokens.. rip
---
This dude should be #1 (Like if u agree)
---
Nice but too small and way too unbalanced
---
Oops meant to say big box
---
Can I get the background?!
---
Thanks) 
---
I dont like to see painted drawings, it destroys the drawing.
---
The concept is cool and I like it but it would look better just in graphite
---
That‚Äôs a fun achievement, but it doesn‚Äôt work if you attack the whole other team.
---
It's like someone stomping on his head
---
That face don't match his goofy voice lol
---
It looks great except for the head. I like his old head better.
---
Who would use NO HAT MORTIS as a new mortis main I‚Äôm ashamed 
---
Time to stick a fantastico here birdie birdie I've got skills to bull-ieve the show must go on the house I'll fix my power chord guns hahaha
---
I need some suggestions of which brawler and which theme! Will I make next?!
---
my selly will be the same i had 500 trofhies with her now i have 250 on my old account
---
Why would he be serious? Look at what the map looks like. How did you not see that lol
---
I went in duo showdown and was teamed up with a bull. You know what he did . You guessed it the coward hid in  a bush. 
---
lol
---
Those walls between lines are "tall"
---
:)
---
It's all luck man. Nothing but luck. I got Spike @ 1500 trophies moreless and already 20 brawlers on 4300. I'm sure that this lucky Spike on my flair would make you have my luck and bring you amazing brawlers soon!
---
I have already kicked 9 players who have bin inactive for 20+ days I can‚Äôt afford to kick the other 6 just yetüòÖ
---
You get trophies for being 5th and up in showdown, you don't need to win
---
I think that you lost? Right?
---
I think bull and primo suck at bounty
---
It shoot water? HMMmmmmmmmm
---
[https://imgur.com/Fz2fmgS](https://imgur.com/Fz2fmgS)

thanks~ I will continue doing this when I unlock my 20th brawler
---
Damn bruh it‚Äôs almost like it was a joke
---
no 
---
Yup ... I tried to explain it to him but... *Sigh*...
---
That's true. But on every map to bounty when somebody goes afk u have lose
---
Rico will be remodel too
---
Yup, but you still tried to correct the post, lol. And the ‚Äúi think that I speak more languages than you‚Äù isn't necessary, stop flexing  
---
Me
---
They don't care bcz they don't won't to give any updates ...
---
Sorry I didn't remember about him. My bad
---
Nah, u
---
Pots are breakable
---
Bro I don‚Äôt see much teamsters and I have a few brawlers at like 450
---
There already is an brawl stars discord
---
Artists are popping up everywhere
---
I have both the mythic lol but don‚Äôt have super rare or epic, except rico, which I have.
---
Where is panda nita
---
I still laugh but I'm an el primo main and personally I protect the gems and let my team grab them but if they don't I do and run to our side #goodprimo
---
I hope this wins
---
The update should rise wed so i highly doubt they gonna patch it with it
---
Welcome to the climb!
---
Make it 5-10 reports. After a person gets 5-10 reports someone from SC should check if they are actually teaming and take action. It will never happen because they would have to pay wages to someone doing it. If you guys know CS:GO they have a nice reporting system there. Would love to see it in Brawl Stars. 
---
You got 3 bonuses, you are very lucky
---
Yeah seriously they just fucked up whole game now they are not even giving balance changes then how to talk about updates but this image is awesome and gameplay was amazing
---
Yeah I guess, but I was just giving him a remodeled design. 
---
Removed - DO NOT SUBMIT POSTS WITH TITLES IN ALL CAPS. CAPS LOCK IS CRUISE CONTROL FOR COOL
---
who‚Äôs the red head in the middle 
---
I have him and i still call him op
---
awesome!! i love it!!!!!this is the best works!!
---
i want to see another character artwork!!! plz upload more..
---
Salveee
---
I made a clan the minute I stared and have around 30 members, I have done this in clash Royale and COC before, I believe that you should talk to your friends or other players and convince them to join(sometimes you must bribe with promotion). And then once they join others will join because you will have more members and your friend's friends will join too.
---
So you need to recruit a lot . Ik there's a recruiting subreddit for clash Royale which I used idk about brawlstars.
---
Check out my other projects on my account
---
No u
---
Go to page of bs then at top 3dots are there click it and then click changed flair bang it will be done all brawlers are there...
---
A little person who wields a giant bear as their special move. Hmmmmmm 
---
This, technically you could even be number 1 player (highest total trophy count) and.  Never win any games except purposely come second or lower.
---
There is a spanish version of the trailer.  His voice is fantastic.
---
Very very ew
---
This is kinda useless. In 300+ trophie matches everyone's name is ??? and if there are 2 bulls in a game - one teaming and one not teaming you might report the wrong person. Also I don't think they will read reports... 
---
I‚Äôll start searching for a recruiting subreddit, thank you.
---
XDDD UPVOT
---
Ye, he gonna win
---
Hi Chinese friendü§ó
---
why cover the name and the club, but not the player tag.....
---
Np
---
No hat mortis is not worthy of an icon.
---
Yes is colt
---
Thank you! I was going to put Poco in there, but the idea of Leon going invisible was super tempting so I did that instead.
---
yes
---
Super is exodia.
---
Have you spent money?
---
üêºüêºüêº
---
You have a great chance to win
---
Why u looking at the booties of your brawlers weirdo
---
You lucky one, in every solo i play there is atleast a team of 4-7
---
I'm a simple man, I see mortis without hat, i downvote
---
legendary 0.1488%
---
r/woooosh
---
True, sadly I didn't join em yet
---
Yeah, I just did a rough estimation to balance it myself.. Of course supercell will do all balancing ang texturing!
---
You don't have social life
---
We can do it right here. I‚Äôll start it off.
---
I wanna be tilted..
---
You must be a good player
---
Turkish currency is at an all time low, not the problem of super cell
---
Wait, what‚Äôs manuste playing?
---
It's almost the same price...
---
what if a brawler threw down legos 
---
And sit in the corner bush.. lol
---
Leon already got a good Nerf.
---
He is a LEGENDARY, so he is supposed to be good.
---
Sorry if you don't have him yet, so hating. 
---
You got it!
---
So I guess nobody is ever going in the left side üòÇ
---
Unlikely to be implemented, for the app to specify and separate tanks from other brawlers is too much effort for the sake of just one brawler. It's just too much work for the devs, especially if there's a chance that other brawlers can have the same role as him but simply outshine him. 
---
Personally I think giving him a bit more range, but not like back in beta, and maybe a sprinkling of extra damage to be a threat to medium health brawlers like Colt. It should live up to Mortis' Dashing Assassin role and Mythic rarity
---
I am seeing a lot of people will disagree as well..
---
WOW! This is amazing. I like Leon and spike the most, they have thicker outlines that the other brawlers so they kidna pop more.

sorry for not sending the picture because im new to reddit my friend but i have leon and spike 
---
I find it really hard to believe that you are a 22 year old especially when you call others a whiny lil bitch and replies to comments with stuff like these
---
because diverting monetization scheme from giving a gameplay advantage to a cosmetic one is wrong
---
Rico will be getting a remodel next update 
---
As he should because he is a LEGENDARY and Piper is not! 
---
It was the last episode of the season 5
---
I‚Äôm already Leon 
---
Awesome!!
---
I dont think it would be a good idea because it would be very luck releated

It‚Äôs too funny, idk what to say anymore

I would like to work with them if I can... and I will do this for free... lol

Repost?

You know we expect a 22 year old to be more matured, not spending their whole day playing fortnight and replying no u like a fucking loser. Oh haha you commented no you again wow such humour
---
single tooth could be from dynamike too
---
Crow just has them in his nose
---
Of course supercell will try to balance these as much as possible.. Having a legendary is not necessarily stronger than common ones.. you just have more choices
---
I love the fact that he talks about how dangerous it is and colt‚Äôs just like ‚ÄúOKAY‚Äù
---
EXACTLY, compared to a lot of repetitive shit about Leon, Bull in the bush, that's cool...
---
Primo is by far my worst
---
this is true
---
Actually I was only want to make the picture more activeüòÇ
---
But thank you like it, I did work hard on the pose!!! Sorry I'm not good at English but thank you!
---
Pay 2 win-Not necessarily. Having trophy road accessories and rares (easy to get) can easily fill up all your three slots.. so not necessarily p2win
---
Thx :)
---
Well about the new char 
---
A Navy or pirate guy
---
Shark
---
Heavyweight
---
Attack: Arpoon (he has a gun that fires arpoons similar to those weapon to hunt sharks) his range  would be similar to Nita's range but smaller. His attack do pierces others targets.
---
SUPER Shark head. He fires a chained arpoon tha bring on char closes to him (In a special skin could be a chained shark head that bits a foe )
---
Star power (well I can think in r star power for him.)
---
1) he can now pull friend to him too
---
2) he gain a defensive buff when he pulls a target
---
3) the enemy he pull gain a negative effect... that could be +10% increase dmg receive. Slow or other negative effect..
---
4) when he uses his super in a wall he is pushed to that location
---
Lol the new hoverboard guy can passively go over water
---
Yes! Haha 
---
The perfect map for thrower teams doesnt exi...
---
Just need a brock to break the walls
---
Find a new feeling, I hadn‚Äôt seen that someone else had the idea before me.

Wow this thread was a hit üëèüëèüëèWonder if 1.2 up votes is enough to sway SC

Where is bull
---
Yeet 
---
SPIKE IS SO CUTE
---
I got one it was leon waiting for spike I'm both leon main and future spike main
---
This needs to be fixed.
---
Happens everytime with me
---
Oh I wasn‚Äôt aware of that. I hadn‚Äôt seen anyone else with the same idea so I drew it myself 
---
Could you please stop using replace the word bad with skill based.Only rico have a place in this list.I would add tara even in brawl ball she is a lot harder to play than mortis.Colt brock and barley could been placed too.
---
Okay, that's great...
---
I see that super, but what happens if they grab it?
---
I have no opinion of this meme, I shall remain neutral
---
Grats! Also nearly welcome to the 500 club with Tara!
---
Hopefully you gave supercell enough time to get this in the game for next October üòÇ.
---
not for most ppl

Gj man

Rico and mortis yeah but darryl no

I wonder if you are sarcastic or not...ü§î

Thanks!

Piper would rule.
---
Oh my
---
‚ù§
---
Welcome to the "Please Don't Nerf Leon Club"
---
Yeah, you are probably right about the programing stuff, too much work. 
---
I think that giving him more range , even the slithly bit is going to break him in Brawl Ball, because at this moment, great Mortis players can use one dash and catch the ball again, that requires skill. If you increase his range by 0.3 tiles, you can do that without any effort at all, and any Mortis player will be able to do this and break evem more de the mode, and the same aplies to reload speed, sadly. 
---
Without major buffs and nerfs to certain stats, any Mortis buff without being his damage will completely break him in Brawl Ball. Reload speed breaks him, faster dash breaks him, longer dash breaks him, giving him DPS enought to kill tanks will break him against Dyna and Barley, i felt like a increased damage agaist high health brawlers would be the only way if fixing him without changing this Super or Star Power.
---
Good luck with that, I hope you have enough patience to actually finish your experiment 
---
If you play Clash Royale, (or at least heard of it), I have recently got every single legendary card in the game, which was an achievement for me since I'm a F2P player. Thing is, barely half of those cards were unlocked via chests (even with a buff on legendary drop rates), and I've been regularly playing it for 2 years already. The other cards were unlocked by tournament rewards and the new trading system.
---
Sooo, yeah, good luck again because if, and a very presumptuous if, they don't add more ways or better chances to unlock the other brawlers (Im pretty sure they will in the future), you're pretty much gonna wait for years to finish that
---
Have a Brawltastic day. 
---
I can understand that
---
At least you tried.
---
Thank you so much! 
---
Please refer to the description of the work posted on the contest. I have expressed the process of fighting, in comparison to the creation of heaven and earth.
---
Is this a JOJO reference 
---
At the time of posting, I believed I was the first to have the idea. I now realize that I‚Äôm not, but it was still ‚Äòmy‚Äô idea since I didn‚Äôt have anyone else‚Äôs idea to base it off of. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs misleading, at least not the way you‚Äôre implying.

Check out my profile, I already did something like that xD

---
Zapper:
---
Level 1 stats:
---
Normal attack: 
---
Laser beam that strikes immediately. (Auto-aim OP lol)
---
Damage: 800
---
Range: Same as Darryl super (don't know how far)
---
Reload speed: 2.5 s
---
Health: 2400
---
Super: spawns 2 towers with 4 tiles between each other and there's a laser beam between that deals 1500 damage when walking through.
---
The towers both have 2000 hp
---
Star power 1:
---
If you kill a tower you get 500 damage
---
Star power 2:
---
If you walk through the laser you gain 500 hp
---
So this hasn't been fixed yet?
---
Well, even if it isn‚Äôt pat to win. It would break the whole setup of damage / health since rn every damage output is a fraction of other brawlers health. (Mortis takes 3 dash to kill 3360 health brawler, spike takes 5 spike, Franks take 2 hit etc..)
---
rip colt

You're*

I think op is talking about Kennedy, but I op meant 4th in America instead of the world.

Patchy is by far the best Brawl Ball mortis I've ever played with and a lot of other people will say the same.  He can be a little eccentric but he is literally 12 years old, if anything you're being toxic by bringing this into a reddit post and trying to start drama.

It is worth, x2 value but u should save the money for a better offer

Or just check the bushes before running into them.

It should be purple like the gems

I really like the details, like Nita in the bottom is so cute

Implementing this takes 20 mins and makes skins even more appealing. Will Supercell make it? No

Really ruins the mood after you consider talking on his current voice

Awesome! Did a Supercell employee comment this information?

Lol these changes are so random and not thought out at all, this would break the game.

how do u not know at darryl power 10???

No after that talk I deletwd the gake and support talk history deleted too after I reinstall and The talk wasnt in English It was in Turkish. Actually helper said that"I told your idea to the guy who work about skins. He will examine(I used google translate for that word I hope it is correcy) your idea. "

Well, he does now

Um... Why are you complaining? lol

The point of immunity in any game is so that you yourself, as the person who just died... cannot be spawn killed. The point is absolutely NOT to provide a mobile temporary infinite health shield to teammates...
---
What about in team showdown, the dead teammate always spawns in and protects the other teammate by physically being imbetween them and enemies... immunity should protect only the player that is currently spawning, that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs for, that‚Äôs fair. That‚Äôs why I should billets should just pass through them. I also think it should be gone once they start shooting, but the human shield aspect is being manipulated 
---
You are right, but those aren't in super critical locations (there are other options). This is just a concept if supercell wanted to change it. If it really bothers you that much I can fix it and repost it.
