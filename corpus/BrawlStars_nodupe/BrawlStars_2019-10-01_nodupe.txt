*he and his trophies

Yea i know i also sometimes refer to him as her even my entire band calls him her. Normally there stands "fighter" like on all other fighter brawlers, but in german it's "k√§mpfer", just on sandy stands "k√§mpferin" (the female form of fighter in german)
---
Anyway, when you upgraded all brawlers to power 9, you can savely start saving up for star powers in the shop (well you can't use your money for anything else, so it's the only option). Since you have everyone on power 9, the star powers should come, you can't get anything else from boxes, except coins and the bonuses (gems/tickets) and with enough coins you can buy star powers you really want. 
---
So it will go like this: you play some games and open the boxes you got, repeat and at some point you'll get a randome star power, then later you'll have enough coins to buy one, you wait till a good one comes up in the shop and buy it, and so on, in this time you can always try out your new star powers and have more fun than normally, so you will still have much fun in the time you get maxed

Well shit, I guess you don't.

Oh wow i didnt even notice that XD

How can you be that much of a dumbass? Your cropping is horribly shitty.
---
The first SP is surprisingly good
---
It‚Äôs a PvEvP game mode where killing other players nets you almost nothing once you account for time used to kill said players. In any game where you can freely choose to kill or not to kill another player, and it has little to no effect on your chance of winning, killing is considered toxic. 
---
I typically play in the 600 - 800 range, I understand that it is a strategy that is used and I can see that the people who use it usually don‚Äôt win. It‚Äôs not a viable way to play. If there was a live leaderboard then you could strategically select who to kill to maximize your chance of catching up or keeping the lead. But at the moment it typically doesn‚Äôt work that way, you only end up losing and ruining the fun of other people‚Äôs games.

Idk maybe try it?

Damn you fucking suck

Do you have a YouTube channel because you abou get 1 sub
---
(Sad) teaming in showdown (happy) teaming in takedown.
---
Yeah if you want to do it go in a freindly game
---
Well, something else which is fun is: you play crow in duo showdown and always try to hunt the enemies down you see, like there's a shelly, you hit her with your max range, but she can't hit you, if she comes after you, you can just run away, cause you're faster and if she runs away, you can follow her and always poison her, it takes more time, but at some point she'll die, then go for the next enemy, it's pretty fun, well for you it will be fun, but for the enmies, not so much

Mother of god, a cactus with eyes and shiny teeth.  I LOVE IT
---
The point being it looks stupid as fuck seeing 7 brawl stars youtubers making the same exact video about the same exact phone, on the same exact day.
---
Actually I don't think so, because the puppets will attack any enemy as long as they remained within range, even if Billy teams with others if they get close the other teamer will still be risking their lives
---
Shoots a bat out of the broom.

Looks extremely identical! Good work

At least your getting better at doing a jumping skill from dynamike.

I literally outplayed an 8 power cube Brock as a power 1 crow, but of course, SC doesn‚Äôt let me show y‚Äôall the replay‚Ä¶
---
Definitely I‚Äôm at 14200 and only have like 7 power 10s
---
Thx y'all
---
I don't know anything but I will tell you that they will add later merches in the future, I hope.
---
Freaking masterpiece.
---
Thx, enemy actually can just kill him while he's stationary to save their controlled teammate. His other stats can be changed
---
Or Hanime?
---
That‚Äôs a big oof
---
Hey how's that negative karma goin huh?
---
My understanding was that they were moving it to something like amazon to reduce costs
---
1.3 k seem like a lot of damage for a 'homing' attack. How far would it go before it dispapears?.
---
That must of sucked.
---
Oh yeah...
---
*crack*
---
Well hopefully you see in amazon, cause some youtubers might be getting new merches somehow later in the future and could be sold to anyone else on amazon, for now you should just wait and see.
---
That‚Äôs mean

It's like you weren't even trying xD lol. Nice tricks doe.

I could nerf that a bit

Congrats Lad! Nice name btw lol.

I was about to put it in the comments XD
---
Thanks man
---
Not to be rude but the middle looks like a swastica
---
Playing a level 1 enemy with level 10 brawler in low trophy range is fun. Using max brawler immediately after its release is fun. Having all brawlers from the start is fun so you can focus on improving your skill. Having all of the skins is fun. You can choose whatever skin based on your mood.
---
Getting many tickets and token doublers is fun. Playing event and getting a lot of token is fun. So you'll have a lot of regular box that will save you spend money for the next new brawler. 
---
Getting many more trophies because you have all the brawlers is fun. 
---
Your profile looks cool with all level 10 icons. Cause you know, flexing is fun. 
---
You can see only people that are truly free to play that complain on reddit about not getting legendary etc. If you're complaining a lot, than you're not getting the fun playing Brawl Stars. In the end the people who spent money for this game will always have the maximum fun of this game.
---
"later"

Honestly I camp because I dont want to play that garbage, I just want the token lol
---
Sorry to say, but this was already made by someone like a few months ago.
---
Fine
---
I think the speed boost while in super would be better as a star power and not natural.
---
This is unrealistic, Piper cant shoot that close to BULL AND SHELLY and kill them! Frankly, I am disappointed
---
Lmao it‚Äôs not a PvE mode otherwise they‚Äôd make everyone on the same team.
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEPOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT
---
I understand it's a crosspost but you still should be asked first.
---
Only 3k difference is not a lot. I am at 15k and usually get teammates and enemies atleast 6k under me, often even under that. It is extremely rare for me to actually get an ally or opponent that has about the same trophies (+-1k) as me.
---
Jeez, no need to get rude

Not me bruh every trophy I grind to win I think I appreciate it that much more then putting out $99 or whatever to buy a chestful. I loan wolfed it over a year before I ever join the clan not saying they're very helpful but I'm learning.

Must of been a punch to the gut for the other team

2 weeks in I got 23 brawlers including crow and spike

Have you thought that the maps are designed to have awkward spots to check bushes for a reason? Then by that logic, all showdown maps should have no bushes whatsoever.

It would certainly look cool. I bet Bo Lin could do it.

There is a sub for that but i guess the reminder would be less friendly

I tried my best though

Also, I dont feel like wasting so much time grinding when it could otherwise be spent doing something more worthwhile.
---
Yea I think they should make it so after not getting any legendaries for a while our chance should be boosted by a little bit (better than nothing).
---
Thank you!!
---
Thanks! :)
---
lol
---
Thank you :)
---
Matters what's inside of it doe. lol
---
Thats exactly why it doesn't does 1000 damage
---
Thanks :)
---
Thank you !
---
actually there's a brawler called beesniper in the game files :)
---
Yes, I know that. Therefore, I decided to make Piper with such a skin)
---
Depends how the game implements it. Brawlstars does it well imo. But lots of games are just insane with the amount of money you need to spend to have an impact.
---
is it on phone or on pc?
---
No you dont, I did it once on my other account
---
it's a good skin
---

---
PC
---
It's a copied post
---
angry birb is cute birb
---
As a "p2w" people call me noob and say I don't have skill, but when i play on my f2p acc, i easily got bull, shelly, colt, dyna, brock, and primo to rank 20 at LEVEL 1 like bruh stop saying I'm p2w...i did spend money but it's on cosmetics (skins) and on brawlers (leon, spike, piper, mortis, tara) simply because I don't wanna wait for them to appear in boxes. However, i have played for pretty long and havent spent money on upgrading brawlers, and it is entirely possible to earn coins fast enough to max out your existing brawlers, and then spend them on star powers. Also i have all my brawlers at minimum lvl 9, with 35 star powers NOT YET UNLOCKED. I also don't have sandy but am at 17.3k trophies.
---
This isn't harassment,  it's just recruiting,  albeit a dirt bag way of doing it,  it's not against the rules.
---
I can't believe that works, it really shouldn't be, i mean how do they even ask for refund? And why would supercell refund them if they spent all the gems they bought?
---
Got energize tho
---
Add a link here so we know what you're talking about
---
you wont, think of it as a debt you gotta repay
---
Can we get refund on skins? For example refund on ligh mecha bo and get 10000 star tokens/points?
---
8-Bits here to help is he okay I can here as fast as I could
---
good idea, but imo 30 seconds for the super is too long. That is like 1/4 of the duration of a bounty match.
---
r/lostredditors
---
Boss bot ;)
---
Yeah like people have the pp to upgrade her AND the coins
---
I need Sandy, too. I had all Brawlers for 3 Month.
---
Yeah, I only use him around 550
---
If it was  ade by Gedi-Kor why didn't he posted it himself
---
Oh I... dont have Twitter...
---
No and yes. There‚Äôs a limit on the time before a refund can be processed. I believe Apple has 30 days holding onto the money and then no refunds nothin, it moves onto the game company
---
Not really, he is without hat so he is awful
---
Wait Arindam that you?
---
Damn, do you have like, no delay at all? Share some of that nice internet of yours ;)
---
Yea, i think everyone atleast once got super chained to death by a shelly (more like the entire team got super chained to death by her and they could easily win, cause of that)
---
Come on its a MAGIC hand but your right on carl
---
Because adding a +1 is like buffing Nita even tho it‚Äôs 1, it will take her less shots to kill a bralwer meaning the game will be unbalanced/ not the way supercell intend to be :)
---
What did he say
---
They bullshit
---
Hmm... I think that's the same reason of cause for the Brawl Ball Long Super Pass Glitch. It only occurs when two brawlers (of different teams) use their super simultaneously which causes some weird stuff.
---
He is??
---
A moba version with tiny robots (Minions) with 3 lanes (or two) of towers and a base, you gain power by killing robots, towers and Brawlers.
---
But... they could just make the brawler squares smaller and still retain the empty spaces if that's the reason? But I don't think that's the reason.
---
YOU SHOULD FOCUS ON YOUR WORK

It might be an issue with the servers. Was it just now? I was playing until a few minutes ago and me too I was getting matched with AFK players. Got 7 games like that in a row where I was the only one playing on my team. Never happened to me before.
---
Yeah, it would save you exactly 1.25s. Such a big deal.

‚ÄúAccording to all known laws of aviation, there is no way that a Piper should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The piper, of course, flies anyways. Because piper doesn't care what other brawlers think is impossible.‚Äù

Yeah then sandy gets his super and uses it now what?

Place something

It's about their uniqueness. Special abilities. The easier brawlers to get have more basic attacks. But as they get rarer, they get more unique. Like invisibility.

How? After his reload speed got nerfed coiled snake got nerfed how?

Upvote 100%%% crazy good skin idea nice work!
---
yes
---
Exactly!  Now what if I told you it was actually a drawing of Earth?
---
Now its a shitty drawing isn't it?  The color of a thing matters.  This artist needs to try again or go shopping for better ink or something useful.  This a crap image.

---
Rarity has to do with the brawler‚Äôs abilities and interaction. Legendaries have passive abilities, amazing supers, are able to be play makers and are overall more well-rounded.
---
If you take a blas√©e brawler like Shelly she shoots and relies on closeup range for her super to be effective. 
---
Compare with Spike. His shots disperse, his super changes the game by creating an area of denial and it slows movement. Legendaries and Mythics have extra abilities. As you go to common brawlers they‚Äôre still great but they can‚Äôt do as much as the brawlers above them. You have to take advantage of their strengths. Sandy right now is just so OP in every game mode.
---
There wasn't any official nerf to crow , instead his star power got a buff in the last update
---
And Mortis a Lengendaryüò∂
---
One thing is do a drawing of one object and do it wrong, another is do a drawing like this, with various objects and colors, and mess up with ONE, so you aren't 100% right
---
Well yes, but actually NO.
---
It's not good for meme review
---
That's a pretty good idea great job!!
---
On the topic of Gene stunts, what would happen if three genes stood in a triangle and used their super in each other at the same time?
---
thanks :)
---
It would be cool if they rearranged rarities based on good a brawler is in the game lol
---
Nice skin foe next update
---
yes i love BS but i would love it even more if it gave me Leon
---
Thanks
---
Crow isn‚Äôt op
---
r we just going to keep saying 'nice'
---
That was me
---
Not funny meme but true tho
---
Fast reply but I do have a question what if somebody is maxed out how do they donate then??
---
im on the hunt for Leon
---
He looks like Nita‚Äôs brother now! Good skin!
---
simple answer infinity donation :)
---
Zeb89 reference?
---
That was me....
---
Why tf did you post this 4 times
---
They already did.
---
Mecha Crow,Touchdown Bull,Shark Leon, Pirate gene are all comunity concepts!
---
~~WHAT HAVE YOU DONE~~
---
looks great
---
Shelly Vinitin ma dude, perhaps if you presented your statement properly and written your comment without such negative words  ,maybe then your comment here wouldn‚Äôt have negative karma .

Your choice of words was why I gave that chris guy (bull) a better and proper assumption on this situation
---
MAMMA MIA! dobbiamo fare un raid in questo server, non possono mutare tutti noi italiani!
---
Billy is a legend
---
At one point I had every brawler in the game except the 3 epics. I had all mythics and legendaries. I contemplated just buying the epics with gems. But eventually got them all from boxes.
---
Now sc will put from the makes of brawlstars intro if they are making an ad for rush wars
---
Looks amazing...but then the original star shelly wouldnt be that exclusiv what it supposed to be.
---
Btw nice job
---
Know your place fucking trash
---
You made me laugh
---
Dude, with 22 brawler, you should be way higher. This is not a flex.

very true, I agree with you that repetitive low effort memes are bad but you referred to all ‚Äúlow effort posts‚Äù so I rebutted you as I‚Äôve found many low effort posts on reddit that are hilarious too
---
I also feel like the OP maybe just wanted to see how many people playing brawl stars agrees with his preference of brawlstars over COD mobile
---
Lmao when I saw the music note at first I thought a saw a swastika lmao
---
a fusion i can get behind

I hope that Mortis will watch this!

You‚Äôre the problem

Yeah, I feel bad. I bought him for 150 just a week before this offer. Also bought Shiba Nita which got lowered to 99 and Summer Jessie which had a deal with Beach Brock. I'm never gonna buy another skin at full price.
---
Grazie üòä
---
Sandy is pretty balanced though not even close to leon
---
Maybe they want another Clash Royale crossover.
---
Thanks a lot!

the flu of playing before class makes me like that

jokes aside though, why not both? why are we obligated to choose one or the other?

We played this game for a long time but no one realized it.
---
the sounds thought
---
Your hugs are.... too.... prickly for me
---
You are correct; in a mega box the pts are just more concentrated among fewer brawlers; the amount is the same
---
No; in a mega box the pts are just more concentrated among fewer brawlers; the amount is the same

Cool skin on the type of dynamo because mortis kills him, here are the brothers)
---
What? I don't get it
---
Hey are u in a prime club or is this name from those times when prime was big?
---
the tap mode, i hate so much this walking mode, i never understand how the guys can playing in this form kkkk but i like the portrait mode couse don have auto fire, no noobs
---
Leon was finally revealed
---
there are videos on the channel that can be viewed only if you have the link
---
Stop criticising Mortis, many randoms with Mortis are bad in Brawl Ball, but not the most.
---
What is "has"
---
"Facciamo a fettine e cubetti questa pizza"
---
No I maked it
---
dont make a limited star skin avaible to everyone for cheap

I dont know maybe u saw something simlar but I made this.

---
No, mitico. XD scherzo grazie
---
YESSS FINALLY
---
I WAITED A MONTH ^(i think) ON THIS
---
but every brawler with a charge ult would break the map imagin daryl jumping from an island to another
---
Thank you it's gud do you run a restaurant?
---
Throwers have two choices either walk the ball in or super the ball in
---
SUPERCELL: N O
---
Nice trick
---
Thats kinda great
---
For I minute there I thought this was minecraft....
---
Edit I meant the bought that loses throws the bomb XD
---
supercell should make all game modes except the actual solo modes work by players number and the cap should be five for example if you play lonely in gem grab you will play a duel instead of having to carry 2 randoms means you go 1v1 or if you have 4 clubmates to play with you will go in a 5v5 gem grab
---
Nvm it was a troll account
---
I am litterally at 13993 now in Italy it's 10:03 PM so i'll try to do it with a duo with my friend tomorrow and i hope to find something (missing Mortis and all legendaries)
---
E ti senti subito a casa
---
Did you know the real saying is:
---
Good guess, but actually no.
---
I was playing as Tara in duos and there was this amazing Gene that I played with. I pushed Tara like 70 trophies with that person, and then they sent me a friend request and we talked a little. We don‚Äôt even speak the same language but hey, it was pretty cool.
---
This is a joke
---
The game doesnt give me Piper which is Epic! I play since the launch of the game and have almost all the mythics
---
Actually, I work at Bull‚Äôs Dinner as the second Chef in command. Bull is the Boss and first chef
---
No us
---
Bro I just realized your frame of Ryan Sempai got in the video! Great job dude!
---
Maybe change the pink hair to a different color because the pink doesn't look good with yellow imo
---
She actually destroys with the right team comp and strategy.
---
Bull would probably dominate by camping at where brawlers land.
---
Lol i think you were so mad after that
---
New record?
---
Carefully, he s a hero
---
lmfao
---
got me good LMFAO
---
At least you have gene
---
Why you do him like that? Lmao
---
Thats what my brother said to me. The bot was doing better
---
I was camping, and i wanted to get him to give me star points at 550

Almost every Mortis except in Bounty is a cunt. In gg they always steal the gems from the actual good gem carrier and either dont attack at all or attack and die with every single gem.
---
In Heist- Why do these reatarded fucks even play mortis in heist?
---
In Brawlball: Can't even dribble at all. Mobility is the single benefit a mortis has as a ball carrier. They just run around with the ball doing nothing, doing that weird going left and right behind a wall thing like that would help so much and expecting their teammates to teamswipe the enemies in a 2v3, and then they taunt the enemies by waiting infront of the wall or doinh uneccessary trickshots like they did fucking anything.
---
Siege might even be the 2nd best mode in term of how good random Morti are. They can help sometimes when the enemy team has a lot of throwers and such, but with tanks on the enemy side they can't do anything. In defence they can't do shit, in offence they can't do shit, they can't keep or gain control properly and even snacking a few bolts isn't that easy with a tank on the enemy team.
---
I have random Morti outside of Bounty, they are the worst. I have legit met one good random Mortis in a mode outside of bounty and that was before the devastating nerf to Mortis with the brawlball rework, where you then needed ammo to shoot.

colt: OMG DUDE THATS NASTYYYYY

Same here
---
That should be in the game but it too similar to 8 bit second star power.overall I love this idea.
---
I know what you mean, if you get one pumped by a bull anyway then the bandaid doesn't matter(been there).
---
I know, I know
---
Brings me back to beta when I p ln payed heist. There were 5 barrels and one bull. I'm proud to say that I was one of the darryls
---
no love for mortis?

You can go right ahead

Morris and Waluigi‚Äôs Pizza!

Even still these star powers are still decent in their own right.

Actually score and get trophies, that's my motto

I push to 10k in to months, and cant even get piper, only stupid spike and mortis

Sorry if I haven't responded to anybody but my comments won't load.

Hol-eee shit was brawl stars scuffed

Idk I‚Äôve been playing since global no legendaries it‚Äôs definitely possible

Or how about the grim reaper?

Wow he trows sand

It doesn't even matter cause it's basically a programming humor.

Why was my post taken down I'm asking if anyone has a clan I could join what was the reason it got taken down

I kinda feel that the colour contrast is weird, and with everyone‚Äôs opinion, I agree that star shelly wouldn‚Äôt be special anymore.

Ya I don‚Äôt get it /:
---
the title reminded me of a story i read in english last week
---
Suppose that you were sitting down at this table. The napkins are in front of you, which napkin would you take? The one on your ‚Äòleft‚Äô? Or the one on your ‚Äòright‚Äô? The one on your left side? Or the one on your right side? Usually you would take the one on your left side. That is ‚Äòcorrect‚Äô too. But in a larger sense on society, that is wrong. Perhaps I could even substitute ‚Äòsociety‚Äô with the ‚ÄòUniverse‚Äô. The correct answer is that ‚ÄòIt is determined by the one who takes his or her own napkin first.‚Äô ‚Ä¶Yes? If the first one takes the napkin to their right, then there‚Äôs no choice but for others to also take the ‚Äòright‚Äô napkin. The same goes for the left. Everyone else will take the napkin to their left, because they have no other option. This is ‚Äòsociety‚Äô‚Ä¶ Who are the ones that determine the price of land first? There must have been someone who determined the value of money, first. The size of the rails on a train track? The magnitude of electricity? Laws and Regulations? Who was the first to determine these things? Did we all do it, because this is a Republic? Or was it Arbitrary? NO! The one who took the napkin first determined all of these things! The rules of this world are determined by that same principle of ‚Äòright or left?‚Äô! In a Society like this table, a state of equilibrium, once one makes the first move, everyone must follow! In every era, this World has been operating by this napkin principle. And the one who ‚Äòtakes the napkin first‚Äô must be someone who is respected by all. It‚Äôs not that anyone can fulfill this role‚Ä¶ Those that are despotic or unworthy will be scorned. And those are the ‚Äòlosers‚Äô. In the case of this table, the ‚Äòeldest‚Äô or the ‚ÄòMaster of the party‚Äô will take the napkin first‚Ä¶ Because everyone ‚Äòrespects‚Äô those individuals.

Fair enough

Leon has been touched too much, and he isn't actually unique bc sandy has invis too. I feel like Sandy's sandstorm should decrease reload speed, because thats a mechanic not in the game yet.

8-Bits second star power isn't that powerful anymore.

I mean the longer you played the, more experienced you are so you'll be better. If you have 12k trophies, theoretically you would be better than someone who has 1k trophies.
