I think he/she meant that you can affect how the super is used by moving in different ways, but yes, the rockets always land in the same pattern, Kairos did discuss that in his true blue/red video

Darryl was one of the strongest brawlers a few metas ago because he was buffed with dmg and star power. He was overpowered. Now, he is worse due to a star power nerf but still good. Only good with star power, arguably one of the worst w/o it. Possible to get to rank 20 without star though

You need to have at least one brawler at level 9.

NO

Eww so bad

Just because this game has brawl in the name doesn‚Äôt mean we need a Meta knight.
---
nobody said that barley needs a nerf, and NO Dynamike still the best thrower  he literally has more damage than barley, nobody of both needs a nerf or buff they are neutral, and I don't care if you report me reedit isn't my life its a hobby

Yep, and ur no different, stop, we get it.

---
Damage isn't everything. It's relatively easy to dodge his shots, especially if you're on top of him. Dynamike also has very little control compared to Barley, and as a thrower, it is as important to have control, if not more than damage. Also, Dyna's star power is very situational, while Barley's is relaible and keeps him in the fight longer.

I don‚Äôt think this is a good idea because the mine arrangement is rng based, and you can see the radius of where the mines will be placed so how can they miss your target lol

if u are pushing with only one brawler at once the matchmaking pool increases(probably 7k-10k). my first 500 is at 5k. i was playing with 8k-11k(sorry bad english)

The story I'm referring to was when the ring was really small and there were no rocks or anything so just us fighting. We killed the guy and his teammate respawned and killed us at low hp. We couldn't go anywhere and didn't have the hp to survive the bubble time. It is definitely on me though if I pushed them like you said, but in situations like this it's not up to choice.

Is it a good star power? Yes, not the best, but useful. If you have other brawler near to star power and he needs it, go first for that one and then for Pam

Star Powers that are a "must have": Darryl, Jessie, Mortis, Carl (not sure tbh), Rico

Possible, it be really strong against tanks. But it also take 4 shots to kill rico haha and you could make his reload very slow so plenty of time to respond between shot 3 and shot 4. What‚Äôs your thoughts of 22%? It would take 5 shots to kill brawlers then

Wow that‚Äôs insane

Just tested it myself, generally it seems to be quite precise, the four bottles that form up the corners of the super land in roughly the same spot (small deviations every 5 supers), but the middle bottle seems to deviate a hell lot more than the others, normally it lands closer to the left two bottles(overlap)
---
My speculation is that the 4 bottles at the side land more consistently as they seem to follow the sides of the prediction circle when u hold down the super button, but due to the middle bottle having quite a large area it can possibly land in (as seen when u hold down the super button) , it deviates a lot more
---
Just blown my mind
---
Oh okay. Also it looks awesome and it‚Äôs a great concept
---
Vary low.
---
Is it only me that saw Sans?
---
I wish they had done a polish but it's still good.
---
In a sorta better wording, no because the mortar already denies a lot of movement for enemies; imagine dealing with 2-3 of those cannonballs flying at you simultaneously. It‚Äôd be impossible to move.

You‚Äôre right, the final decision on whether El Primo needs a buff or not is totally based on how Rosa does in the meta. If Rosa‚Äôs OP, El Primo most likely needs a damage buff, if Rosa‚Äôs trash, we can just nerf Bull slightly so El Primo will be more viable

This will change brawl stars

2 legendaries in first 10 boxes, are u serious?

To reach 10k trophies with all 24 brawlers (excluding Rosa) you would have to have all your brawlers at 416.67 (so 417) trophies.

You're time will come after 23 hours and  38 minutes &gt;:/

Rosa in disguise confirmed
---
lol got spike at 800 and I thought I could complain not getting one since. at 4k rn
---
I don't think she will be that good on showdown (except for very bushy maps) because she'll just get kited by long ranged brawler and destroyed by throwers, but other modes yeah that 80% damage reduction will reign.
---
If u open it b4 release you won't get her cus shes not in-game 
---
Ppl are just saving boxes for when she IS released

thats a coming brawler called lumberjack

@everyone if u do care about u/GEDI-KOR, the brawl stars artist and u/dariusbrawlstars, the one who stole his art, I made a post to stop the conflict on reddit. 
---
‚ÄúIf you cares about u/GEDI-KOR‚Äôs stolen art, please spend a minute reading this. Spread the words if possible.
---
Let‚Äôs just end this in peace, u/dariusbrawlstars and u/GEDI-KOR. If a war happen that would bring nothing but worse consequences: fights between users, damaging Brawl Stars reputations, even u/GEDI-KOR‚Äôs reputation himself. I believe starting a war won‚Äôt make things better... can we all take a part in protecting u/GEDI-KOR, but at the same time don‚Äôt cause hate, anger or discrimination? Can we end this mess, after u/dariusbrawlstars have stopped his shameful actions... if he doesn‚Äôt, let us do what‚Äôs right! 
---
This is also a type of cyber bullying, and we should all aware that.
---
Hopefully this guy have learned his lesson. If you wanna get upvotes please consider start taking art classes. I‚Äôm not defending Darius, I just want this to end in peace, and we can Brawl happily again. Let us remember the purpose of this subreddit: to connect and bring joy to players... So please stop the hate! If this continues, I‚Äôm afraid u/GEDI-KOR, this guy, along with the subreddit will fall. If this continues, the brawl stars community will not get more members. They keen to stay away from community that have too much hate. We are all part to make the community better, NOT worse. Think about it, who would join a subreddit that is filled with hate? Let‚Äôs us brawl in peace!‚Äù

So you get big game tokens from playing big game but you need big game token to play big game

this is cute, I approve

Not photoshopped. It‚Äôs a glitch that happens to some people due to internet connectivity and such.

Exactly

No, you get the tokens by playing as a normal brawler, and you use those tokens to play as the Boss
---
I know the glitch is real and maybe you‚Äôre just assuming he photoshopped his own for karma instead of looking for one but I looked at all of the comments and the picture etc and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs photoshopped.

Good map, can you see the my map?

Dynamikes usually spin in SD match to team with other Dynamikes

I was talking about your comments on he original post smh

Thrower hell

No way

What about RandomsExterminator lmao
---
i can't even understand what you're trying to say. instead of browsing reddit go and learn english
---
Pretty normal. There's a lot of players(1k-3k trophies) with 1 or even more legendaries, while other at 7k+ have none
---
Yeah but it could change the way we play brawlball and the meta will kind of shift alittle.

Im dutch

Maybe change one or two things that somepeople may want to do but i think this map is an good idea of an brawl ball map.

dude this is unwatchable. we get it, you think it's crazy

Not if you know how to carry randoms in bball. I pushed 3 primos to 500 on 3 different accounts.

Agreed. These people should not even make an account.

ya i've had some really good luck with unlocking brawlers. I'm not very good so that's probably why

Honestly! I mean its obviously a PG game, so edgy its frustrating. Definitely immature youngsters but still like if there was only a way to show their parents this shit

Smart way to aroid the bot lol... the is no need for that thow since you can just do it in the settings ....

Thanks for the other server tho. Hope to learn something there.

I didn‚Äôt say I for sure knew lol, and I‚Äôm at an average trophy range of 370, so I don‚Äôt usually verse star power Leon‚Äôs, the guy I‚Äôm responded too doesn‚Äôt even think Leon needs a change so ask him

Can you access the server though?

I was a member there and suddenly it doesn't appear on the left side of the list.

I don't know if I was banned or something.

You are lucks as hell,I am 6k with no legendary.
---
Oh strange, yeah I‚Äôm on it just fine
---
You really think he‚Äôs being serious?
---
I‚Äôd downvote this crap normally but I was the 69th upvoter so u got lucky
---
This would break lower skill cap player‚Äôs chances - bad inclusion
---
Mortis and Tara need to step their game up! New boy Gene dominates every gamemode.
---
Me spends one ticket: gets paired with star power Pam and gets max time
---
Me gets ambitious and spends 20 tickets: gets paired with level 1 piper and crow and gets under 2 minutes

I'll go against the grain and say she will not be that OP

I'm just commenting so there will be three Crows in a row.

It's nice but I have a question: can I advertise my channel here?

Either I‚Äôm really bad at art or you got some wack eyes chiefüòÇ like carl you see Carl?üòÇ it‚Äôs good tho idrc

he's quite good now
---
I grind day and night. (I'm addicted)
---
Everybody downvotes haha
---
He got nerfed
---
This was already made

I wouldn't put him in golden S tier though. I'd put him even below spike

can you make rosa?pls

dont die with him is all I can say. if you push too hard he's a little squishy but if you keep your distance he does work

Yea, I'm trying

Wow,is this a new AU?
---
This is neat. Cant wait to see the coloured version
---
I don‚Äôt know brother, some sort of alien language
---
Ok this is epic
---
are my eyes playing tricks on me or is the FOV different in replay mode or spectate mode than when you're actually playing?
---
Try trying the skin
---
That‚Äôs not even the same player wtf r/quityourbullshit
---
Wow bro I can‚Äôt believe you unlocked Rosa already AND you won a game with her too! How many boxes did it take because i really really really really want her! /s
---
I appreciate your enthusiasm for sarcasm, but to become a master you mustn't use /s.
---
*I'm a human being, and this action was performed manually.*

Sorry reddit lagged and I couldn't watch the whole clip

Why on this sub. Remove this trash

Yeah, I know, I've done this glitch.

I like this

I can‚Äôt use /s?

I know right, it makes me want to beat the shit outta them.

Deragatory name for Africans/African Americans

Because you had a bad streak before those matches.

Ikr it‚Äôs fucking stupid and annoying, like we get it, you did something cool.

I like that you are forgiving him but I accept and decline your ideas respectfully.
---
Bots.

also Namco's
---
Tranks!

I already posted this... youre late, but i got 4 times you karma on this post

I loved the interesting title

Ok

Thanks sir
---
pacifism is good
---
Keek E do you love me
---
The luck
---
Said everyone else for the past two months. I think its a glitch
---
No, it's actually not. They are teaming. Pan doesn't get the powerups the Carl's get and their base colors are different.
---
Also, if you want someone to watch something, don't make it unbearable to watch. Just a tip
---
Didn't see it
---
STOP MOVING THE FUCKING SCREEN!
---
Congrats, you made a pilot dizzy... Either you are recording this during a natural disaster or you have Parkinsons, either way you need help
---
I didn‚Äôt even attempted to attack the Brock and ye was my last option to not die
---
I was in that situation.
---
I'm half your trophies with no legendary or mythic, also all pushed with randoms
---
Vary but you won the game
---
Oh god oh fuck
---
finally tara's face
---
Leon + Spike = Like
---
I think i might use this in a meme if u dont mind(ill tag u)
---
Wait he _coppied that Darryl skin_
---
Its gonna be so until rosa gets nerfed
---
But if I'm not being serious that means nothing made me think that. Just joking man, it's funny people complaining for real of noobs getting good luck when they don't. Well, there is a point to be made about the drop system in the game, but I know it won't change so what's the point?
---
Same here
---
Stella electra?
---
a lot more than it should have
---
Credit is always good üëçüëç
---
I‚Äôm thinking 80 gems
---
Tranks (Good question, I did not do it. Haha)
---
No im saving up for shiba nita
---
It doesn‚Äôt seem like a cash grab like most other advertised games imo
---
Patrick made a sacrifice for the team.
---
Cool
---
Its not a real Pok√©mon its just rosa
---
You do see what, I also see.
---
Ikr I can evolve on the game without paying anything and still fun. It's all about skills.
---
it's a mark I putted on so we can all know it's mine :v
---
also... it's done so we can all know it's mine lol. pls Darius, don't steal this (I'm kidding lol)
---
Nah im not that hyped because she is a rare so getting her would be a piece of cake
---
I've done this more than infinity.
---
Thanks.. But why not?
---
Why? He stole one skin. What everyone else here is doing is worse, and *can* get you banned from reddit
---
OwO UwU I_I
---
Me too. Tara and shelly arent that bad.
---
1556 trophies, 10 brawlers :(
---
I think some like Rey are on a higher level but he still ditches Leon boxes
---
But some of then could be srceenshots without editing
---
Begone you teaming scum
---
And frank too
---
Oh hey i think i got a brain tumor
---
what's your best strategy
---
I don‚Äôt see any 3d models there? Sorry if I‚Äôm being dumb
---
Whenever I try to play Piper in Heist I somehow get left trying to defend the safe by myself, every time. I normally can't handle it :(
---
The one or two times I can actually get to the enemy safe I feel like I can slam it pretty hard.
---
Do you have any tips? While corner case is still around...
---
Only post maps on make a map Monday‚Äôs please
---
Why would they be bots?
---
Pans brawlertale
---
He's a tank! No need to.
---
Its a trap!!!!
---
This literally looks like the infinity war poster
---
Don‚Äôt advertise
---
Hat
---
maybe this would work if cancel buttons actually worked in supercell games
---
Yeah they do
---
Play a boss = 20 or 15 tickets
---
no they don‚Äôt
---
You threw the game in order to get "revenge," not only is it not revenge as they had lost the first match, they were just playing the game how it's meant to be played. Your justification for throwing the match was childish
---
\*saves 60 boxes for a rare brawler\*
---
Dang, what a god. Good job üëç
---
ok
---
Piper in a Destroyed far future...
---
Shut the fuck up noob
---
Really? I love brawlstars. How has clash Royale changed so much? Can you explain specifically things you don't like?
---
I suggest you should sit down, take a break for a few hours, then come back.
---
You're welcome! Keep up the great art!
---
i dont think its bs that every single goddamn gedi-kor skin has to be pumped into their game. they have theri own ideas too
---
Do we know her star power?
---
good bot
---
I mean regular mortis (top hat) is great but I can't stand NOT seeing the in-game night witch effects now
---
U agree in-game effects are awesome right?
---
are you retarded
---
When a brawler comes out it's always discounted in the shop, and a discounted rare is 19 gems XD
---
Kinda reminds me of Rick Grimes from The Walking Dead.
---
Anyone else?
---
kkkkk ala os falantes de portugues fazendo bom conte√∫do pra comunidade
---
No like, how many gems *he* has.
---
Fr?
---
I love Brawl Stars as well, but as with much of the community, we would like a definitive answer to teaming in solo showdown. Not these same 4 or 5 viral clips of mushrooms, we need to fix that.
---
As with Clash Royale, the trophy road is a good idea, but having joined back in after 2 or 3 updates I dont understand why we need all the UI changes.
---
Fat Spyke, kid Spyke
---
Agreed
---
Typical price of fucking 12 year old shit
---
El promo lmao
---
I get that, but some are just too good to not be added. And I'm not a GEDI-KOR fanboy, as I personally dont like some of his skins because of just how much is going on in them.
