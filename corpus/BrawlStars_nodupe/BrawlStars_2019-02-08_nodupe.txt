There was a doubler deal in December. 2010 tokens for 69 gems.

This is a funny statement because I had 500 regular boxes, 25 big and 3 megaboxes saved when Leon came out and I didn‚Äôt get him from any of those. Then I bet 80 tickets in Robo getting max rewards + key doublers and after opening 50 boxes I got Leon üòÇ makes you think the old boxes couldn‚Äôt have Leon but it‚Äôs all luck ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
That's what I thought. Don't even wanna play a friendly match. Weak 
---
Not if you play bounty and are aggro af while you're dying more than your killing. I've seen those people get star player before 
---
Servers in Zimbabwe 
---
How raged the other guy is lol
---
How?????
---
When Mortis actually had a good 3D Model.
---
That's just going to make Brock and Piper kill everyone
---
calculate centripetal force on this spinny boi
---
Play in organized teams. Randoms never get the job done
---
Same with my primo, 400 to 340
---
That was a galaxy brain mindset, wtf, get rekt teamers.
---
Too much?
---
Please no. Just no. 
---
God damn a toxic comment section...
---
I dont have link but it was leaked with new mortis remodel that is right now in game 
---
That's odd, I get mostly throwers and Ricos 
---
I just played against you last night, first time we lost and second time we won haha. Jonnyboy‚Äôs mini acc? 
---
i lile how in the botton left corner the username is clear and somehow they messed up anyways
---
Not necessarily, by my point was that it would encourage people to get kills or something rather than the game‚Äôs objective.
---
Well it should be teamers.
---
They dominate bounty nevertheless 
---
Or you all stand in the same bush and strike. 300+ is rigged with Dynas and Morti. If you aren't one of these sworn enemies, pick a side...
---
hey Star Wars started off with a little wincest yknow 
---
Zero. Not opened a single legendary brawler yet.
---
Maybe you shouldn‚Äôt have spent all that money 
---
But why should I die

Look how they massacred my boy

Using the exploit? Hope you get banned as soon as possible
---
enemies from everywhere
---
Idk
---
People keep saying things and I ask them to give me their user name and show me their skills, and they don't even reply. 4 people. 1 from my mis titled double post.
---
My point is, if you're 350 Or 500, simply not understanding the fact that I know people winning doing this exploit and it isn't fair to those people in the 250 range even. It's funny... But it's not a way to handle a game.
---
If a player closes the game, intentionally, it should count as an afk for a temporary ban. Not replaced with a bot, so when they log in before the (play again) thing, they get brawler trophies and can manage to not lose any. 
---
But the issue is what would you as the player who got ksed from would do? You are to weak and even if that shield stays up for a fraction of a second it might make the difference because some characters attack faster than the others. Suppose a basic Dynamike and Nita situation. Dynamike ksed from Nita and gets a shield Nita quickly spams all three attacks in the time it takes for Dynamike to finish/summon (though with summon she will probably get only one hit in). This means Nita was blocked from her damage and probably dies to Mike. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Maybe they should go for some QoL changes on Crow then. i don't see why they would inherently make a badly graphical ability. They can also make it so landing on someone directly does no damage but provides him with some short immunity or enhanced poison damage. Or just make all blades land but that sounds broken.

When you get spike to 600 &gt;
---
guess u're right ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 
---
Yes
---
Would buy
---
I thought that too but then I figured out that it would make Jessie attack the other brawlers
---
Tu tambi√©n eres espa√±ol? 
---
That's why Primo keeps wasting his super on my turret?
---
Also pennies attack hit the other Penny with all 3 coins
---
Just tap rapidly, it skips faster that way
---
That's called autofire
---
problem?
---
Yea
---
Woah I never noticed I though they were flames
---
What's a common? What's the difference between common and trophy road?
---
This idea was mentioned not so much ago but ignored, glad someone is mentioning it again. Hope they add it.
---
Og player

That was some OP moves, here‚Äôs an upvote. 
---
I'd want ur coins lol I'm broke
---
I found this guy when I was pushing trophs with low brawlers
---
So on a battle royale "free for all" game mode you expect there to like... Not be a lot of enemies around you?
---
There are arguments for teaming but this is not one of them lol. Your argument is basically "its too hard without teamers." 
---
No Brock hat tho
---
Just have ten different bralwer on one map
---
Sounds dumb no offense 
---
oof
---
But playing the objective is part of being star player, it could be 80% of star player is objective, 20% is damage, then it would be fine
---
I would've throw the heal turret on myself 
---
Screw you guys have every brawler every star power but legendarys and my luck is .24
---
Spot on. I have nothing to add. Except that teamers are trash. But they already know that. That's why they're teamers.
---
SC better fix it ASAP

This is amazing!
---
He is still too squishy thats the main issue... All people with same or less hp than him has ranged potential, when he does 400 each hit from long range because thats the max you can get with his daggers, you also have to consider obstacles that block his daggers. He doesnt do much ranged and you will rarely see yourself killing people from ranged. Meanwhile people with less HP than him can easily kill. I believe he needs HP buff
---
Love a healthy dose of homophobia in the evening boys well done
---
I never played against a bot dinamike I only became one and my friend spectate when I dcd (which wasn't intentional)
---
Look, about the auto aim which is also besides the point, the bots have a range proximity system that's, I'd say medium not close spam (depending on brawler).
---
A brock or Jessie, won't, and can't manually aim from a far distance that well, since they are bots, but if you try to dodge when they are close enough, and strafe left and right while backing up at the same time, record it and slow motion the rocket is going ahead of where the direction you are moving.
---
Whereas auto aim by a human, it goes to where you are on that spot, making it easier to dodge. It's easier the further you are also...
---
One note also, pro players (YouTube one idk) don't even shoot in too far distance if they were brock or colt. Because they're enemies dodge it. They're also a high trophy level.
---
Not sure if that makes sense to you.
---
What trophy level did you even test this at? Why even use a mini account? You can't even see how they move, how can you tell they were bad? Did you lose? What trophy level? Lol. 
---
Why? It was funny!
---
I bet people would still team

Supercell: "Yes... yes you do bud"
---
If you click on the box, then the "I" button for info it tells you the likelihood for everything
---
Yes I understand that KSing is a harsh topic, although truthfully I dont see that occur NEARLY as much as cleaning up. I totally agree with your shield idea for crow as a buff, like I said, I really dont care what type of buff he gets, he just needs it. I have him maxed and hes a legendary, dunno why he would feel weaker than when I play for instance jesse or some of the "bad" brawlers. I dunno about majority crow players, but I cant seem to "impact" the game and let my skill do the winning, its determined whether the enemy has 1 good killer or not... that shouldnt be how the games designed
---
The Pam went up to the enemy because her team started winning, I'm pretty sure that wasn't lag
---
Not that one.. Not finding legendaries in the box, in the shop, the offers that cost 549 gems
---
dashingly handsome
---
Because this bull shit is ruining the game. It's not funny. Its sucking all the fun out of competitive gameplay. Its gotten to the point where if you don't team you just get ganged up on and this is the result. You end up with 10 people in a game who are either teamers by choice or through coercion. This shit needs to stop.
---
The legendary offers appear every 1 to 3 weeks :)
---
You honestly don't sound like you know what your talking about. All Supercell games require the same system requirements. Which means if 4 out of the 5 can work then the latest one should aswell. It's very CLEAR that it's a software issue that need to work on to make it compatible. The game played before Global release and now it doesn't. Which means they changed something that just "broke" on Chromebooks. Which has already been verified by Frank and is currently being worked on to fix the big causing the crash. 
---
He just played well and you bad
---
Yeeessss
---
Star power
---
Why am I looking at two identical pictures?
---
Yeah that last paragraph makes no sense. Mini account? If it's from a loss, did you have another device to spectate that you can show us?
---
2 phones and one recorder. (3 total devices)
---
1 phone I'm sure maybe your mom's or dad's, sisters brother, to be the spectator
---
1 phone to disconnect yourself 
---
And 1 recorder to video your "mini account" whatever that even means, to record the bot in action. 
---
Record the phone you disconnected, and reconnect to prove that bot was you. 
---
Hassle right? I know... 
---
Congrats on 10k
---
Thanks ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
that‚Äôs one of his voice lines. go look

That‚Äôs a fact

Np^^ I‚Äôm hoping to get spike. 
---
Thanks man!
---
Lol gotta love autoaim 
---
Chrome OS runs Android software. You can play Boom Beach, Clash of Clans, Clash Royale, and even Hay Day but for some reason Brawl Stars crashes upon opening and stays at a black screen. 
---
For sure fake 
---
It'll work better than having zero boxes for him
---
Thanks for agreeing!
---
I'm saving my 550+ gems for crow or leon, but I'd prefer crow.. 
---
Two Mike's are paired up in Standoff. Both spin. Neither attack each other. Both spend the whole match looking for the other players. Both die to the poison in a state of befuddled confusion. 
---
If they give 1 extra trophy to the star player, 1 trophy has to be taken away from another player to balance trophy gain (for above 300 trophies)
---
Heist 
---
You'll get a legendary eventually, it is just going to take some time. I wish you luck!
---
I know
---
But I don‚Äôt get the joke
---
If the safes werent at 100%, tahts really rare.
---
He didn‚Äôt use his star power either time here
---
Damn, its just a game. If you‚Äôre so pissed about it go play3v3 and dont complain about it on Reddit.
---
it‚Äôs a somewhat old but popular meme
---
The Hat is fine :(
---
Most fun brawler in the game imo 
---
Honestly this is by far the coolest thing I‚Äôve seen all day. Congrats that‚Äôs really cool!
---
Star power, not super
---
Then it is probably just me ;)
---
Maybe its the fast robot/mouse robot from Robo Rumble
---
How bout you record it lmao instead of me I think that'll make more sense so you can prove your theory. Show how the bots are "expert" and how they are not auto aiming and how this so called exploit is game breaking and just overall prove your whole post. And for the love of God please show me how these bots aren't auto aiming. Thanks.

I thought so too. Now I‚Äôm not sure what brings the legendary offer TBH. I‚Äôve been playing since the beginning of the beta (over 1.5 years) and seen 4 bundles during the beta that include a random legendary plus other items. The bundles ranged from 735-800gems. Never even thought about spending money at that point, I enjoyed the game but wasn‚Äôt addicted to it like I am now ü§ë Since the global launch I haven‚Äôt had any offers till last Saturday when Leon popped into my shop for 549 gems so I instantly bought him. I‚Äôm pretty sure most players if not everyone got that offer or a similar legendary offer though. Not sure if the legendary offers appear by level or what anymore since I have only received one since launch. Some of my friends have had multiple offers since launch though.

I really like your idea, but needs some fixes. The parts with the cactus and some walls make 1 tile gaps, and maps cant have them. Fix it and I could really see this in the game!

There is Sales Tax on in-game purchases. A 4.99 purchase in game will cost you $5.40. That card you put in must have sufficient funds for the purchase to go through.
---
Consider this: the game is in an early stage. You might just need those coins in the future, so don‚Äôt count your chickens before they‚Äôve hatched.

o, ok then...

I use to get matched with players with 900 total trophies and 300+ Shelly or Bull. Not anymore, I'm at 5.2k and get matched with 35.k to 7k players. I feel its a lot better for people in my trophy range. I don't play with those super noobs anymore

Yeah, I had never used her super consecutively like this, but it was really satisfying to mash that super button.
---
Amazing idea hope supercell make like this one
---
Thanks. I'm just glad someone posted a video of this happening shortly after me posting my idea yesterday. This is one of the most annoying things about this game mode. Solo and bounty are really the only enjoyable modes for me, and that's barely now. Solo is over run with ppl who either just hide, or bulls who...hide...and wait for the unsuspecting. And as of recently a whole lotta Leon. Bounty is hit or miss
---
How the lantern not falling
---
Mortis would better holding a spear
---
Yeah. I always keep one to two thousand doublers at a time. They seem to be the most efficient way to spend gems.

With this vid I shall see if I can do the same with my Shelly (I'll probably fail but practice will do), Thank You :D

#EEEEEELLLLLLLLLL PRIIIIIIIIIIIMOOOOOOO

What kind of app did you use?!

Maybe make it that u can actually donate money in brawl stars

That's shelly at 100% power

But it‚Äôs not. And if it was, people would play the objective over getting kills. You need a balance to be successful

You can always practice in friendly matches. But this is way much situational, so you just need to be careful

my mike stood inside the explosion radius, nothing happened. Tried to move him around as the explosion happened, same result...

It has $4.99 the 80 gems is $4.99 but I have a $1 off discount. It would be $4.40 not $5.40.

Your 1.5k, it‚Äôs not like your 6k plus.  Don‚Äôt get worked up over it. I‚Äôve been playing since global everyday getting all tokens and have gotten all except spike. It‚Äôs possible, spend your gems on token doublers only and play everyday. Also don‚Äôt be that guy that tries to get Shelly to 500 at 1.5k.  Good luck!

I bring you the gift of darkness
---
That could be mitigated by having the objective somehow count towards star player. I've had bounty matches where I've got star player and basically the only thing I've done is shot the safe. It can't take that much creativity to work out a system where this could work. The biggest drawback is that while brawlers are balanced in terms of 1v1 or 3v3 or whatever combat, they're not balanced in terms of damage output onto other brawlers, some do high damage and some not so much. It would unbalance the game somewhat and change how people played. Wether that would be a bad change or break the game however isn't certain.
---
Technically MORTIS had his hat taken away and the entire community revolted so they put it back into the game as a free skin

Yeah cause he‚Äôs doing a ton of damage like you said. His contribution in those scenarios outweighs his teammates contribution. Pretty balanced system imo. I‚Äôve got star player without dealing a single damage before.

Never saw that b4 lol
---
Robots are genderless...
---
after that happened to me, i got him (with purpose) down to 26 because i had the intention to stop playing (because tap2shoot--&gt; swap2shoot) i stopped for a while and now im pushing him backüòÇ
---
Rico is great in this map. Nice map btw.  The new Heist maps change the meta a bit... That's cool

*Ehem... just poison and run.

*No.

Obviously Supercells altered it a bit and gave it an actual decent name, but it still the same map!
---
believe me, u will love, or hate her. i love piper cuz im pretty good at sniping but many other players hate her(cuz they're just better with other brawlers/ not really good at piper) 
---
Lol, tho wait what u can get a rocket launcher in re2? Eh
---
best mortis skin
---
I hate brawler specific maps like Feast or Famine Skull Creek and Cavern Churn
---
Did you play again with that Shelly?
---
It may be hard because he‚Äôs such a low power, but it‚Äôs still easily doable. Just know your comps and when it‚Äôs good to intervene
---
Um, how is that dramatic?
---
If you go to the shop and click on one of the boxes for sale, there's an 'i' button in the top left corner. Clicking this shows your chances of unlocking different rarity brawlers per box. These %'s will change as you open more boxes. Not getting brawlers increases them slightly, but getting a new brawler will reduce / reset them (I think).
---
I've been playing since global launch and have all brawlers except for the legendaries and one mythic (tara).
---
If you're a free player, then just keep grinding away and hope you get lucky. If you're not, expect to spend a lot of cash in the pursuit of legendaries. Occasionally legendaries will pop up in the shop to purchase outright, but expect to spend at least ¬£30 for the amount of gems you'd need for 1 legendary.
---
Oh,  I actually bought it because I was hoping for a legendary ( though I found 7 items and forgot I needed 2 star powers so my hype was real!  )
---
Heist* not bounty!
---
Yeah and He could have gone after the bull too 
---
King of the hill, basically?

Thank you.

Goog idea!

Welcome to Base Race! In this 5v5 mode, two teams fight over three bases on a Showdown sized map. *Only one base is active at a time*, and when either team captures it, the next base becomes available. The first team to capture two bases win the match! **A captured base cannot be lost.**
---
The community has requested a 5v5 mode since the early days of beta and there has been a lot of good suggestions throughout the years. I‚Äôm sure the concept has been on the developers mind as well. Here I will present my take on a fun 5v5 game mode. To fit within Brawl Stars, I believe it cannot be overly complex, but I still think we can up the complexity somewhat, compared to existing game modes. 
---
**Table of contents**
---
1. Overview
---
2. Capturing bases
---
3. A complex game mode
---
4. Modifications
---
**Overview**
---
When the match starts, one of the bases becomes available. Both teams fight over control of the base area. The team with the highest presence around the base will start to control it. *Once the base is fully controlled, the team must defend it for 30 seconds.* If the other team manage to get man advantage within the base area, by killing off the defenders, they will start to control it instead. The capture timer will always reset when a new team gains control.
---
When one team manage to capture a base by controlling it for 30 seconds, the next base will become available and the captured base cannot be lost. The match ends when one team has captured two bases, or when time runs out. If time runs out and both teams are tied, the match enters a 45 seconds overtime. In overtime, capturing a base only takes 15 seconds.
---
**Capturing bases**
---
Once a base is available for capture, a small UI indicator will point towards the location of the base and a horizontal bar at the top of the screen will represent the state of the base, with a blue and a red side. In the center of the bar sits an indicator that will move from side to side depending on what team is closer to capture. The team that has the highest presence near the base will start to control it. Once the indicator reaches the blue or red side of the bar, a capture countdown will start. If the controlling team can manage to keep the indicator on their side for the full duration, they will capture the base.
---
If instead the other team manage to get man advantage near the base, the indicator will start to move over to their side, allowing them to capture it. Once a base is fully captured, it can no longer be lost and instead the next base will become available. Teams must now hurry to the new location, and with some clever planning, they can head out there in good time to start controlling it just as it becomes available. This is where good team coordination will play a key role; you don‚Äôt want to abandon the current base completely, but you need to make sure the other team can‚Äôt get an easy capture of the next base.
---
If one team manage to capture the first two bases, the match will end in their favor. And if both teams capture one base each, the third base will become available and it will decide the outcome of the match. 
---
**A complex game mode**
---
Base Race has a higher level of complexity than other game modes. For this reason, it should not be available to players until they reach a certain level. This is to make sure they have a good understanding of the game and its core mechanics. Matches will typically be slightly longer than for the other game modes, up to 5 minutes. This should be reflected in its rewards. A victory should award you 7 trophies (at 300).
---
As Base Race require good team coordination and preferably a solid plan, players should be encouraged to queue up with their Club members. This game mode could be a special mode that in some way is connected to your Club. It could reward Club points to further incentivize playing with your Club.
---
**Modifications**
---
Here are some ideas that could be incorporated to make things more interesting, at the cost of some added complexity. Most of these ideas (but not all) are there to make capturing a base easier. All of them should not be used, they are just different suggestions.
---
**You respawn at a captured base.** Once your team has captured a base, you will respawn from its location when you die.
---
**Standing close to a base you control will increase your stats by 10%.** This will make it easier to defend and capture a base that you control, making games play out faster.
---
**You respawn at the base your team controls.** If you die and your team is defending a base they are about to capture, you will respawn near that base. This would also make games play out a lot faster.
---
**Team boosts.** At various locations around the map, certain boost pickups will spawn. Retrieving these will temporary boost your team in a way (increased health, dmg, speed). Players can choose to hunt for these while the rest of the team tries to capture a base. These could spawn in boxes if you want teams to fight over them.
---
**Poison Base.** A special and nasty base that deals damage to anyone close to it. Teams will need to handle this as they try to capture it.
---
That‚Äôs all! Thank you for reading and please comment with what you think of this idea, and any suggestions you have that would make it even cooler üòä
---
Regards, Mordeus
---
i ve tried to search up for a discord groups but that group of russians that lives on the most east is sooooo small and i dont understand japanese or chinese. but i will continue searching
---
Fr idk what he‚Äôs on about I get 12 coins every other day lol....
---
Yes yes and a more yes, water balloon shots?
---
Supercell one is dope too
---
Good luck buddy.
---
And why is that?
---
While with a token doubler you spend 50 gems on 1000 tokens (10 boxes), therefore 5 gems per box; 
---
with this megabox (10 boxes) you spend 49 gems, therefore 4,9 gems per box.. 
---
Even with star power, I can see the ground burning. 
---
Yeah you‚Äôll get lucky with them appearing in the shop ever so often, but they are steep with the costs. If you don‚Äôt want to spend money on the game, your fastest route to good brawlers are tickets for weekend events. 
---
In a way, but modified to fit within the game.
---
Haha funny post!
---
Damn üòÖ
---
I didn't know that box can talk...
---
28 v 0
---
What do you mean? This is solo showdown.
---
Hulk in Sakaar

He looks like a skin for old Rico, but he looks cool
---
In the full picture you can see a Primo coming for me but I cropped it out
---
thank u so much for this 
---
Read the post my dude
---
What is so special about this?
---
No problem buddy, happy brawling.
---
Not happening bro
---
Can I buy?
---
then explain why when i have 30 trophies and my teammates too i get into match where every enemy have 300? 
---
This is the funniest post i have ever seen
---
But i wasnt like it anymore
---
Wow That was Epic
---
Saaame asfff it's Terrible

\*Ricochet smiles\*

Would be great if he had some sorta hat

Guys Leon lv 3 nerfed at 400 + trophy ... the problem is .. why only 403 trophy?

Lembra o Hulk de Thor Ragnarok.

It's a joke, relax manüòÇ.

Just make it so that you play that map casually you have to choose barley dynamike or mortis

It* posted twice, stupid Reddit mobile

Lol
---
He shooting fish?
---
How friendly :v
---
Your post has been removed, make sure to use the body of a post to elaborate on the title.
---
Wait, since he already uses a shovel and a big comb to attack people, I think a sword might be overkill
---
I wonder what is in that brawl box tho.ü§î
---
Cara postagem em pt br levam ban aquu kkkkkkk
---
I have 193 solo victories 
---
I like how El primo has a crow flair
---
Why is it in another language
---
I didn't understand why are you complaining. You games seems fair with good matchmaking. There is not a brawler with 200 or even 100 abouve each other.
---
home alone CONFIRMED
---
Now fit the spike in the brawl box
---
Who's the one ine the left side of pam?
---
Wow
---
What is this
---
I like this map tho
---
It‚Äôs totally not because I only push Thicco no no
---
Crow
---
you did not looked at it very well. even though the trophies are close to each other, you'll see that i got a 100% guarantee win after i had 3 defeats.
---
and yeah, you won't believe it that my teammates who were in my defeated match is not doing well. it feels like they are just throwing away the game.
---
5 stars
---
Crow 
---
That would be crow 
---
Yes l I know I have every brawler at lvl10, but he needs money to upgrade to level 9, 1250 exactly, he doesn‚Äôt need just pp, and he is spending all his money in po
---
The bo image looks like a gold ferret lol.
---
wtfüòÇüòÇ
---
Dyna because first of all Mortis has a slow reload speed and the Dyna‚Äôs can take advantage of that and attack him when he doesn‚Äôt have any ammo...
---
Superb. It's a shame they gain trophies for this
---
thats fake
---
Yes exactly! The more man advantage they have, the faster it goes :) The base area should be about 5-6 tiles so you don‚Äôt have to be on top of each other!
---
That shelly is trash
---
Never, NEVER use he as a gem carrier! If use, pls don‚Äôt in random matches! Is better use it in heist than a gem carrier.
---
Why watermark something like this
---
I honestly don't like either life leech or angry robo and I like this map but still upvote........do you know that cavren churn is the exact robo rumble map without bushes and three different walls in the middle
---
Most likely because of that matchmaking exploit you used to get to 1000+ trophies 
---
Oh look, a skin that looks excellent and actually had time put into it instead of a shitty recolor of a traced picture of Leon
---
Daym those skills
---
I was top 1 shelly 1300 trophies (i used the exploit). Maybe supercell found out i used the exploit and made my shelly 0 trophies. 
---
Nice
---
Ummmm.....what was that
---
yeah right
---
Love the style! Now I want an animated series with these :D
---
Does optimized memory mean that it won't start lagging after a few games?
---
Lol gg
---
Wow a coincidence??
---
its not fake check out auto aim god his shelly is at 0 trophies too
---
Never paid a cent and I have 21 brawlers fully maxed. The last one I‚Äôm missing is Leon, who was only in the game for a month, and I got Spike in June
---
Didn‚Äôt mean to. I didn‚Äôt want to repost
---
Gem Grab is capture the flag in essence
---
The token doubler will eventually give you a mega box in total so if you buy the mega box straight away you save yourself 1 gem
---
One mega box are 10 normal boxes, 1000x is the same but i prefer having the key doubler
---
Mega box
---
Well, I mean anyone would spend their money to buy Leon or spike, not crow
---
Somebody remake in english
---
Even memes get stolen, my friend...
---
Stolen 
---
No its not, it literally says on the box info
---
Wow lmao
---
I mean that became after those win tradings, in the period when they fix band matchmaking and add ??? Names.
---
I remember a message on discord were people explain what action to do if you wanna make a team with random people.
---
Imho  sooner or later teaming was unavoidable because the mode permits that...
---
Pigeons when I feed 1 of them a crumb of bread
---
Got Colt and Ricochet to 500 on this map üëç
---
doubler is better cause it kinda forces u to play games
---
Thanks for replying. Quick follow up. So if there were 3 members of each team around the base, would there just be stalemate until at least 1 member of one team dies? (Stalemate meaning the base wouldn‚Äôt begin to capture for either team)
---
YIS!
---
Token doubler
---
Liar
---
It's a crosspost...
---
Leon is OP. That‚Äôs the problem. He is very easy to play.
---
Reddit wont let me access your comment asking about one tile gaps, so I'll answer it here: 
---
In the lower right slide, there are 4 places with two pieces of wall and a box between them.
---
In the upper right, there are one tile gaps between the fences and the walls near them.
---
Yes, it is possible
---
yes yes yes YES YES YES
---
What exploit?
---
Holy shit
---
Barley: I'm ready to serve.
---
üòç‚ú®
---
This is helpful thank you
---
Brawl ball is shit now. It‚Äôs near impossible to score, matches takes way too long etc.
---
Bring back old brawl ball ffs
---
Its so funny to see that when only one guy backstabs the whole team falls apart. 
---
If the bases were in that layout, a domination gamemode would make more sense. If it were capturing bases as you suggested, the team with a spawn closest to the base would have a massive advantage, instead, the bases should be next to each other on the middle
---
Thag would be an amaizing skin!!!
---
This is clickbait not a glitch because they weren't have the same amount of power cubes :) 
---
Nice. I just run sooo showdown to get theologies faster. I hate when people team and attack others in a group. I don‚Äôt mind if you team because your in a tight spot and don‚Äôt want to lose trophies. I can understand that but if you attack in a group it‚Äôs just like why?
---
Im 15, tnx for asking,kid
---
very good info, thanks buddy üëçüòÅ
---
Hi riochan, iam a brazilian player and i have a un band you make a logo for me? U an dragon (sorry for bad inglish)

Wow man. That was depressing to watch lol
---
I kinda inspired myself with him tbh
---
A 5v5 single life elimination game, similar to showdown except for the 5 player teams. You get one life and once a team is eliminated, your team is awarded a point. Game resets, first to 2 points (Best of 3)
---
*Showdown maps will be used for the gamemode*
---
Each team spawns on their sides of the map, (example, red on right, blue on left.) 
---
Please help me fully devolpe this idea, as a full scale war will be pretty gosh darn fun amiright?

---
**even his aura is thicc!**
---
No, the trophy gain/loss doesnt depend on rank but on throphies amount. For example if you're under 30 trophies you can't lose them.
---
Why optional? Is there a device restriction change in there?
---
being skeptical doesn't mean its not real.

XD

For once i feel sorry for the bull

Bcoz HTC is Android. Best explanation ever. Dude how da heck are they going to ruin everyone's else's game by Optimazing it? That's why it's called optimization. Where are you from. IDK where but I see from these texts that you are very stupid and possibly rich. Maybe not a millionaire but good financial cuz u are talking shit to a phone that can Run PUBG Mobile . Why don't you think that people need money for fucking food and to pay bills. You can't eat from buying a thousand dollar phone. Plus here where I am living people don't get as much money as people in America get. Idk what phone you have. How da heck I'm I going to have Samsung Galaxy S9 when we here don't have money to buy luxury like Americans do. I am not saying that you are American.
---
personal best
---
It should be fireworks, that would be so cool. It is a 150 gem skin after all
---
Ah, thanks
---
I am at 6.4k too but with 15 brawlers
---
Its better than any gay supercell map
---
Avoid shelly...Good Luck
---
This is some excellent feedback, thank you! My original design actually had all three bases available all the time, and you generate points by just controlling them. It‚Äôs a classic approach. The reason I went with only one active base at a time is that it felt more in line with the philosophy of Brawl Stars; it‚Äôs very straight forward and you always have one goal in mind. That being said, I‚Äôm very open to add more complexity!
---
I also agree with your feedback regarding the timers. As long as the other team gets a chance to take the base back after you control it, the timers can be lowered. It off course depends on how the capture mechanism works.
---
As for the total duration, I don‚Äôt feel like 5 mind is that long. It‚Äôs up there with the ticketed events. And I feel like this mode would need it. But you could increase the rewards to match the time spent. I had an idea that you would tie it into your Club and I still think that would be a nice way to motivate playing this.
---
Finally, I really like your mod idea. It would also make sense to stay and defend a base then if you could quickly get to the next one!
---
Thanks again for the great feedback :)
---
Cant believe i read that lol 
---
Try the brawl stats app
---
No I actually was serious
---
That's totally true
---
They're all bots... probably because you're tilted or something the game decided to cheer you up with bots. Click to see that the second place didn't get any trophies because he didn't actually play.
---
Did you try to blow on your phone ?
---
Excuse me what
---
She probably dropped some chromosomes in enemy spawn
---
P2W
---
Know your range, Spike is a glass cannon, it can deal a lot of damage but it‚Äôs really weak. Try to understand with which brawler you can be aggressive and with you can‚Äôt
---
Oh my bad i didnt see the boxes by the corner waters. They blend with the and background and bushes ;-; so yeah good map
---
Just blow on it, maybe it'll fix it
---
OK thank you mate
---
The menu screen servers are different to the game servers 
---
God nerf shelly 
---
Lunar is better. Even if you want the gold the extra 70 gems can be used to buy 550 gold so either way lunar is better
---
I think that as long as he has his super ready hes great in any mode, except maybe bounty (I have a level 4 rank 15 Frank pretty much just in solo showdown and a little bit of gem grab so I think hes pretty much a good overall brawler). But hey u do what you want
---
No I made it myself ;)
---
wear his hat
---
point still stands, but i get what you're saying they should get all of them if they're gonna reset people.
---
Fair point
---
Now you‚Äôre at 32 total trophies...wack 
---
I agree!
---
I‚Äôd give you more tips but spike is the only brawler I‚Äôm missing 
---
Kind of active 
---
Ladder rewards are so trash 
---
Wow this is actually really cool ! Finally a good Tara skin !
---
It's OK don't worry
---
Brock is really good indeed!
---
yeah rip
---
Underrated !
---
Fuck je
---
Yea but what‚Äôs the general consensus on where you start encountering them 
---
Trophies? Fav brawler? Fav game mode? How active?
---
I was about to make the same joke lol
---
People on this subreddit haven‚Äôt passed 1st grade math class it seems....why are people thinking token doubler is better wtf
---
Thanks that‚Äôs an amazing answer!
---
gotta get that loot
---
I wonder if this is stolen simce it says "how to draw" and "link in bio" on there
---
You forgot to draw Leon, I can't see him :O
---
Probably over 250 trophies is when you‚Äôll start running into the occasional one. Once you break the 350 plane you‚Äôll start seeting them close to every 1-3 matches. 
---
Of course the exploit was in their game, it was a broken mechanic that was not intended (hence the word exploit). The thing with exploits is, that if you do it deliberitely (breaking the mechanic) then you are abusing an exploit to gain advantage, thus should get banned.  
---
Here's a take from Terms of Service that you agreed upon when installing and playing the game:
---
 
---
**License Limitations**
---
Any use of the Service in violation of these License Limitations is **strictly prohibited**, can result in the immediate revocation of your limited license and may subject you to liability for violations of law.
---
You agree that you will not, under any circumstances:
---
* **Use or take part (directly or indirectly)** in the use of cheats, **exploits**, automation software, bots, hacks, mods or any unauthorized third-party software designed to modify or interfere with the Service, any Supercell game or any Supercell game experience.  
---
Now it's completely up to SC to determine how they want to punish, and for you they decided that it was enough to reset your trophies, even though you broke the agreement you agreed upon when deciding to play their game. I will stick to my opinion that they should've banned the account instead, since the exploit was done deliberately from your side.   
---
(Bolded the important statements in the snippet from the ToS)
---
It's a great map
---
Thanks
---
15 secs makes more sense. 
---
Active for like 20 mins. many times a day (mainly for star tokens)
---
Fav brawler : colt
---
Fav mode : heist and showdown
---
Trophies : 7.2k (about)
---
Coming mid february
---
How üòÇ ?
---
I bet Bull is hiding in them.
---
ah,i get what you you were saying now.Thx for the feedback
---
Than why is Mortis only B in Brawl Ball - before update I would have definitely put him as Excellent
---
The best tip anyone ever gave me in BS was: learn to dodge. I know it sounds obvious, but strafing and having irregular movements is key if you want to stay alive.
---
*you're* was the joke. And a complex one at that, apparently. Whoops.
---
Yeahhhh crow and Tara have shit damage and would be absolutely useless without that range and Leon is straight garb at that range
---
It‚Äôs Bigger Boot!!
---
Doublers definitely
---
Especially with Mortis &lt;3
---
F for Enigma¬°s name
---
Blitz is the mobile version but yes 
---
Calm down... just you don't have skill to play this bush-map
---
This idea is in pretty much every game tf2 wasn‚Äôt the first to come up with it
---
When I unlocked frank I grinded this map and got another frank on my team. We won 16 games in a row lol 
---
Im supah active, at 8700.
---
My favourite mode? Everything that isn't gem grab. Maybe bounty. Every mode (for exept gem) is fun imo.
---
My favorite brawler? Nita, Leon or Darryl. I like them all.
---
then sc copys CR system. now u can get same brawlers and upgrade to higher lvl with tons of coins.
---
Awesome !
---
hope this helps
---
Heist
---
Yeah definitely, I agree 100%. Should be a fun mode too like the whole team can‚Äôt be inside at the same time in case an enemy Brock drops a special on everyone. 
---
Brawlsexuality really bouta be a whole ass movement thanks to this
---
You have 1 more brawl box than me but I have3 more star tokens so we are basically exactly even good luck with urs
---
Maybe showdown 5v5 would be good, but it would be hard to make a 5v5 level in any other mode that makes sense. It's too many shots flying.
---
Supercell kidding u
---
No game can be perfect, but Brawl Stars can 100% be better than it‚Äôs current state.
---
I honestly don‚Äôt look into the meta - because casually it doesn‚Äôt matter, but I think there are a lot of brawlers that are very out of place, and one of them is Leon.
---
Creating a character that has the ability to sneak up on other characters with the upmost stealth, and practically guarantee that he will win (accounting for who he‚Äôs sneaking up on) should not be in the game.
---
I personally disagree with Leon‚Äôs whole concept - because if I wanna play (say Crow or Colt) in showdown, and just get snuck up on from a Leon I didn‚Äôt know existed, I‚Äôm just gonna start steering away from playing Brawl Stars
---
Its supposed to be a hard fight in the middle, both teams will struggle. 
---
Kachow
---
Spike and Leon overall the best 
---
You have great brawler and skin ideas. And make them look amazing, really hope SC makes this one and tara's
---
Really nice
---
So you are at low trophies... It's easy..
---
The token doubles AR 5 gems per box
---
The 49 deal is slightly cheaper per box, as it values 10 boxes
---
-laughs in barley-
---
I enjoyed it
---
Good write up thanks for the help
---
Really?
---
Thanks QwQ
---
Flames. 
---
So damn cool
---
I get also crashes in the middle of a battle, lets say, \~1 min after starting. PLEASE FIX THIS ASAP!!!
---
Mortis should still be S in BB
---
Check the bushes then
---
With Leon's HP, pulling without a secondary attack would be suicide. Imagine the field day Bull or Shelly would have with being pulled towards a weaker character with less health...
---
And rico, thrower teams and star power bo.
---
When a literature major uses reddit
---
They are absolutely worth it.
---
There are two things which you can do 
---
1.	Buy token doubler which will be equivalent of opening 20 boxes . 
---
2.	Or you can buy mega box which is also equivalent of opening 20 boxes .
---
Though I consider that opening 20 boxes separately may be more effective for unlocking brawlers.
---
Nice job dude!!! 
---
Shakespeare* doesn‚Äôt just make things longer

No. It's not true.

You fucked man. This map is the worst map of the game. Thanks for nothing, your dumb

mistake. MY name is jake\_the\_great73
---
Yeah good luck
---
no
---
So much better than yesterdays. Thank you

As a piper main, this is epic

Cool idea, but it seems a bit overpowered

I love this map
---
Play showdown
---
So I don‚Äôt get it, do I lose my progress on the ladder when the season resets?
---
Must still be below 300 trophies 
---
Cavern churn is a grassy map, so tanks are good in this map lol 
---
I always Do. But when you fight with one person and are almost down, then someone rushes out the bushes.

I always check, but when in action, I think everybody knows this situation,  you sometimes don‚Äôt have the chance to.

I think everyone here know this ¬´¬†trick¬†¬ª ...

*UPCOMING ON CARTOON NETWORK*
---
Oops my bad for missing that :p 
---
yeah so if the timer only comes into play once the bar is actually filled up then something like 10 seconds or even less seems balanced.
---
i wish they added the last sentence as a Colt's voice
---
Still breaking the 1st rule (Join. isn't a descriptive title. The "1 cm below" isn't part of the title.). The reason why descriptive title is good to have is so that people know what the thread is about. "Join." says nothing what the thread is about.  
---
If you forgot to add the first post to correct subreddit then you could've just deleted the post and then created it on the correct subreddit with the same title.
---
I mean if you miss it won‚Äôt look like much at all is happening. 
---
I still think the punishment is way too drastic. At least you didn't get banned. Are you F2P?
---
Lmao thank you man!
---
yeah im f2p my main acc is at 8k trophies
---
I'm not sure what you mean. It's intended to look like a robot, just like barley and rico etc
---
;)
---
Mine is 0.24% still can't get him.
---
I agree! I had an idea where this is a Club event. That way you can play with people you know, pref on VC and you can make up strategies before hand.
---
he‚Äôs not viable at long range, he can‚Äôt even do half the damage piper does at the same distance. I‚Äôd like what you‚Äôre smokin. 
---
I've done that so many times myself ü§£
---
On both the fence and the barrel/box right below enemy Safe
---
Nice concept! For some reason my initial thought was that the Eye of Rah should've been over Taras eye (since she watches only with 1 Eye) :P
---
Thumbs Down because of ridiculously long title.
---
google just searched mortis
---
his reload speed is already awful, his range isn‚Äôt broken. His attacks do less damage the further away he is, doing very minimal damage at max range
---
Some people have gotten 1000+ without the exploit. 
---
[https://i.ibb.co/vPX0nYQ/Delete-Piper.jpg](https://i.ibb.co/vPX0nYQ/Delete-Piper.jpg)
---
I have seen it before 
---
maybe you just got the same idea :)
---
Interesting point. 
---
The pull should be very weak, just about a bit less than Primo‚Äôs super knockback, so Leons can still poke Bulls and Shellys without it being a death sentence. 
---
But I think your argument is really why this rework should be used. As of now Leon has really no counters, since he outranges shotgunners and can dish out way more damage than ranged brawlers, without taking much back since he has a much faster movement speed. 
---
If Leons have to think twice before engaging a shotgunner, then thats a good thing. He shouldn‚Äôt be able to fight just everybody IMO. But that‚Äôs because I personally think that different brawlers should have counters and have to play around these counters. It makes the game more balanced and engaging.

Why dont you say something
---
Cause it makes sense to cut bushes with bullets right? 
---
But im talking specifically about these players with total trophies of 1200 trophies and have a brawler at 1000 trophies. They obviously used the exploit. 
---
The capture time should definitely be based on how many Brawlers you have inside the area, compared to the enemy team! If you have 5 and they have 4, it should tick up slowly in your favor. If you have 5-0 it should go really fast :)
---
I‚Äôm not talking about in a 1 v 1 type situation I‚Äôm talking matchmaking... getting paired with other players who might not be as good because you don‚Äôt ALWAYS get matched with people with the same amount of trophies 
---
take mask with red x off and its ninja leon
---
good for you guys
---
I believe that u r not coachflaljack, so did u just stole it with its owner's name? 
---
In this thread, people who don‚Äôt have Leon shitting on Leon while experienced players explain how the game actually plays. 
---
it's due to the star power. he is alright without it. 
---
Petition to nerf shelly's super to charge 33.3% per shell rather than 35%
---
Hmmm how do I trust?  A little pice of thief or coach flap jack name Tag in the corner of the pic? 
---
not all players lost their trophies some are still at 1000 trophies and still did it with the exploit
---
Do you think they should allow simultaneous capture (let‚Äôs say 2 countdowns at the same time) or should it freeze and have only 1 team inside in order to allow a capture countdown?
---
I could see this mode really working because the mushroom healing is already implemented in the game and the countdown (from gem grab) as well. A few minor tweaks and brawl stars can have this in full effect. It‚Äôs existing features put together differently. 
---
It would be cool if he had white hair and a samurai hat
---
If you disconnected from battle a bot would've taken your place but you would have gained no trophies.
---
!Remindme 1 month

I love the angry robo it helps Previn camping imo

Lmao kinda looks like bull a little
---
What was your first legandary?
---
wtf why u copy and paste ur comment
---
Flair checks out
---
Leaked footage of Blend S (brawl star version)!? 
---
I liked that. It would be really smart and cool. Competting for all 3 points at the same time. It would really call for team cohesion and harmony.
---
No, I got Leon from a special offer.
---
Please bless us with gene! 
---
Maybe instead of a racket, wouldn't be better an energy drink font? (Sorry for my bad eng)
---
Probably should just stay in bounty
---
It's time to J U M P up in the air
---
They'd be a lot more recognizable with base skins.  Also a lot more helpful.
---
This is awesome! I would buy this skin 100%.
---
Map doesn‚Äôt even matter that much for him anymore because his super charges automatically meaning he‚Äôll pretty much always be able to roll in and assassinate, especially with his star power which makes him nearly invincible after rolling
---
This would be fun to play 
---
r/IncreasinglyVerbose
---
El Primo, if he jumps, he can get stuck, and indeed any other fighter
---
I got token doubler
---
Maybe if you capture a base it gives you buff and each can count as one point. If the other gets the final point it counts as 2 and goes into a sudden death where there is only one base which you have around 5-10 seconds to capture and have longer respawn time
---
It would have a strange effect in my opinionüëç
---
Only historia model. It's very ugly.
---
Literally unplayable 
---
Not only is subs op in fifa I guess
---
I always wanted to shoot down someone I teamed with. Too bad they always shoot me down first.
---
Carefully, he's a hero
---
It seems harder to notice than Darryl‚Äôs dumplings. Honestly feel it could‚Äôve been better for 150 but I like the design. 
---
whatever idc enough i‚Äôm just saying it‚Äôs fine how it is. it literally just gives you some extra xp for getting star player it‚Äôs no big deal
---
Leon is OP: needs a buff
---
Which one is it?  Lol
---
Before he was kinda useless, now he is useless, cant even use him in showdown maps where he was good
---
That‚Äôs benson from regular show 
---
Only if reload speed and rate of fire was that fastüòÇ
---
"But... But... There are criminals out there not in jail, therefore I should not be punished."
---
Op reasoning.
---
 *They had us in the first half, not gonna lie* 
---
Get stuck in the water? At that point it is poor play on his part and will just be killed because it's gem grab. On any other game if I jump off the side of the map etc it's my fault and I get punished. This avoids just spamming of supers of many brawlers 
---
Exactly... I dont know what this dev team is smoking, seriously wtf
---
I meant if they made my shelly to 0 trophies other players who used the explout should be punished too lol
---
Lol sorry I mean nerf
---
Yes it could definitely be better. 150 is no joke. Compared to Dragonite Jessie... it‚Äôs pretty Wack
---
My bad edited 
---
Now you've got Supercell's attention 
---
i loved this map!
---
I play a lot with my brother in laws. Great little bonding sessions!
---
WTF
---
Did crow score?
---
Well, Darryl is officially confirmed to be broken 
---
Also apart from Crow, I‚Äôve noticed that assassin brawlers are dominating the game. After the damage buff, despite still being awful in heist, Mortis is now the KING of bounty, Excellent in Gem Grab and Duo Showdown, and great in solo showdown, despite the huge nerf to him in brawl Ball, he‚Äôs still usable, Leon even after the nerf only got affected slightly in Heist and Brawl Ball
---
And healers are also taking over the meta as a support and counter the assassin brawlers! Poco is making a huge comeback as he can not only be a gem carrier in gem grab, he can also support  Darryl, Mortis and Leon to keep enemies away or defeat them, which made him great as both a gem carrier and support in gem grab, as well as making him great in Heist and Bounty where he normally is not good at, and Pam, she‚Äôs just OP even before the update, and the assassin meta just makes her better for the same reason as why Poco is making a huge comeback 
---
**not really**
---
I thought they were teaming in solo at firstüòÇ
---
Payload from overwatch that sounds good
---
I'm a bit confused by your moves man.
---
Me
---
Put water instead of blocks around which water, a fighter can get stuck there
---
Only good things are the brawlers but they take long to get, u literally have to run with your own team and not fandoms
---
It‚Äôs lag between me and reddit caused it to double comment
---
Wow that was close
---
You could say it was a little close üòÇ
---
oh k
---
Wait the season is ab to endüòÇ
---
Never thought I would see a Horrible Histories/Brawl Stars meme
---
Darryl looks like he's about to dance üòÇ
---
r/ lootstars
---
Do you have Leon?
---
They are cute. It will be great to make them reddit hero icon
---
I literally thought of a more basic version of this to no support from here at all. Good to see that our ideas don‚Äôt go totally unnoticed! :)
---
Oh thanks i didn't thought aubout that :D
---
I think of it more as a scale :) If the other team has started to control the base, you first need to tip the scale over to your side to start capture it. The team with most Brawlers in the area will tip the scale over to their side.
---
thx üòä
---
Haha, that would be great.
---
Poco's face tho
---
Agreed, it would be really cool! Hard though with randoms ;)
---
Yes I do. 506 trophies. But when I play with other characters I feel that It is OP and should be nerfed.  
---
Saying that doesn't even call for how you cursed at them. This happens to most people too you know. You spent time on the game and because of that you have to live through the fact that no games are perfect, and all will have bugs.
---
Gonna first us they us lie half
---
The fact that you have him and think he‚Äôs op is crazy to me lol that nerf hit him very very hard I think he‚Äôs where a legendary brawler should be 
---
What did you say? üòÇ
---
oh. for some reason I only say six in the middle XD
---
Thats fair.
---
Well they‚Äôll get reset too, or maybe they didn‚Äôt use the exploit because trophies don‚Äôt get season reset below 3K
---
Guilty as charged 
---
The lie had us in the half gonna first they.
---
His super got nerfed, if he can sneak up on you it means you could already see him on your screen.
---
When you see him go invisible you can try to predict where he will go to counter him 
---
I guess you have a crow too. I have it too. And you don‚Äôt think Leon is much more powerful than crow? Thats weird. 
---
should see him in person lol
---
He is pretty balanced. You need to use him on wide open maps with few walls. He is good on dune drift.
---
Amazing skin bro 
---
You can do this, but with his star power he can be off your screen when he goes invisible.
---
Also, he can be in a bush, and go into super and no one would know - except the guy that dies 6 seconds later.
---
I just feel that you should always have a chance of fighting back - especially as he can still put up a fight at mid-range 
---
Haven‚Äôt gotten a brawler and I‚Äôve opened 5 mega boxes this week... 
---
But it‚Äôs still worth it
---
it's sad that mortis went from the best to the worst brawler in brawl ball
---
1. I like being carried and spammed by notifications
---
2. I‚Äôm too lazy to download discord
---
yeap mate, Thanks üòÅ
---
Technically, the physical shot of Barley and Dynamike are shorter than Piper's, but the potential damage they can do spreads further than Piper's with the blast radius. So shouldn't they be ranked higher?
---
(89+175+266)/3 = 175 tr average
---
Your team has a higher average.
---
What's wrong?
---
I‚Äôve been playing since global and currently am only missing Mortis and all 3 legendary (I have like 31 boxes and 5 mega boxes stored up rn tho). I have like 3 lvl 7 brawlers. I think it‚Äôs feasible for f2p I haven‚Äôt bought anything yet lol.
---
Now I know what Dynamike on drugs looks like.
---
Look at the top trophies for each brawler... Bo has the least. And I would argue that he's pretty weak compared to others on normal maps like that, and he doesn't offer a unique presence (mines are pretty cool idea though). This is just a feeling from experience though (i am a pretty experienced player).
---
I checked it out through your profile :) One tip if you want attention is to add some kind of image your ideas! Otherwise it‚Äôs really hard to get noticed. There are so many posts being made all the time, and a lot of good ideas sadly never gets seen. I know that Domination has been suggested a lot and I‚Äôm not trying to be original here! But I think this version would fit well within BrawlStars.
---
You be clownin my boi 21 like that??
---
But but but matchmaking isn‚Äôt fair
---
 Damn I know right wtf, 10k of trophies to get 700 on season reward wtf 
---
Ok, but once you see it you can‚Äôt unsee it. 
---
I totally agree. I‚Äôm not even saying I‚Äôm original! :p I support this idea and I‚Äôm glad its hitting the front page. Can‚Äôt wait to see this in-game! :)
---
"i-it should b-be based on p-power level!!"
---
Damn those kids
---
That was a sick play
---
I'm not an expert on the subject, so I'll give you the benefit of the doubt
---
Damn supercell should start hearing their fan base, the fan made skins are amazing 
---
Don‚Äôt hate on me Bruthar 
---
ALL HAIL QUEEN OF UGANDA KNUCKLES 
---
If we are talking about team-based game modes
---
Then you can group up with your teammates to counter him.
---
 in showdown if you have Colt's star power and the Leon his super you can simply run away in most cases (especially if he might be using his super off-screen)  and with crow you can escape using his super.
---
OH MY GOD I‚ÄôVE BEEN PLAYING FOR A YEAR AND A HALF YOU DON‚ÄôT KNOW WHAT I WENT THROUGH TO GET HERE YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU‚ÄôRE TALKING ABOUT
---
And Colt
---
do you mean good t-series subscriber
---
‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt it only fair if I win every single game tho?‚Äù
---
Pinky and the brain?
---
I forgot someone at the right down, sry.
---
:c
---
Hi, so I made [this](https://imgur.com/EC5DY4S) to help people who can't figure out which character is which.  I had to double check it a few times because I honestly had no idea who some of them were at first.  Hope it helps!
---
Now EatDatPl8
---
Technically 3 bulls a mike and a Shelly 
---
I love it!!! Thanks
---
Oh, because other concepts like living cacti are realistic enough
---
It‚Äôs too specific though. What can I do as Dynamike? What can I do as Barley? What about Penny? What happens if I‚Äôm Piper but don‚Äôt have my super ready? 
---
Leon puts you into situations that shouldnt happen. That‚Äôs it.
---
I shouldn‚Äôt have to constantly be afraid of something I don‚Äôt even know is there.
---
Oof new ranked brawlers its so ez to gain cups
---
Piper snIPER
---
They will... you just were in a early batch.
---
Beware of getting too close, you hp can betray you. Be mindful of your position 
---
I never said that. In terms of raw strength Leon and spike are definitely stronger than crow. But that‚Äôs more because crow is weaker, rather than them being op. That being said, crow is very very strong if you use him right. His power comes from technique. When I see a Leon in open field using crow I can dominate him without much trouble. 
---
Thanks a lot
---
This is very similar to TF2 Control Points. I like it!
---
Thank you very very much for your amazing response 
---
Like I said about a thousand times before, legendaries were never meant to be the strongest specially. Legendaries are the most unique Brawlers with the most unique capacities. And tbh, Crow is the most badass of all brawlers admit it. He's the coolest bird

Sorry for the cam quality (and drawing quality as well) i drew him in the dark.
---
Colt .45 baby. It's the revolver he uses. 
---
TF2 reference?
---
Global was not even two months ago xD As F2P it must take around a year to unlock all brawlers
---
Oo she sniped my heart.
---
Siiick
---
Leon hard counters throwers with his super
---
As he should but even then if the map you are playing on has a lot of choke points you can just spam them and the Leon will never be able to pass.
---
 as for piper - you should not stand a chance vs Leon if you don't have your super, if Leon farmed his super but you didn't bother to do so, it's your fault.
---
What you're saying is the equivalent of claiming that if Shelley has her super and she corners a tank that didn't farm his super, the tank should have some sort of escape mechanism
---
Without starpower, from s tier to f tier right? 
---
I'd say Darryl
---
I don't see a Shelly in your picture
---
I have 200 gems. Should i buy this skin, or what should i do? Wanna buy some skins but don't know which..
---
Btw I have already bought Dumpling Darryl
---
Ohh thanks, I would have never guessed.
---
Mortis 
---
Oof
---
No
---
Only one that isnt really complete is darryl, his arc isnt his actual hitbox. He has that from his left AND his right shotgun, not the actual middle of its model i think
---
REALY cool
---
r/Icontradictmyself
---
Rockabilly mortis OP!  Have Mah upvote 
---
Kind of like king of the hill/domination, interesting
---
Imo, this is a very well designed map. It's got different "zones", per say. Rico and throwers dominate the outside, while tanks and Bo dominate the inside. When the poison closes in, it's all about avoiding where the tanks are and/or trying to take them down before you get taken down. Not to mention, there's very little teaming on this map either, which I personally don't mind either way, but I know a lot of people don't like/don't know how to deal with teaming.
---
I don't think we want a Ninja skin üòÖ
---
Exactly, therefore increasing the game's income.
---
Yeah except the effect is barely noticeable, same thing with Colt, if you completely stop paying attention to your surroundings then you can see the effects, but they‚Äôre way too minimal for 150 gems
---
Yeah, BrawlStars-style :)
---
You can use blue stacks on computer. But a computer costs money 
---
That‚Äôs why he‚Äôs also obese because he‚Äôs so rich That he can eat his own gems
---
Very well played indeed 
---
It really depends on how desperate you are for the Star Power. If you have enough saved up gold, you can splurge it in the shop to get a brawler‚Äôs power points. 
---
But that is a *very* bad move for late game, as I have learnt myself through the hard way.(I‚Äôm at 10.4k trophies and I only have 6 star powers, and have enough power points to max about 9 more brawlers)
---
I got my El Primo Star Power(my first SP ever) in about...3-4 months of starting out, give or take a few weeks. I‚Äôm completely F2P. But keep in mind I spent gold in the shop. I‚Äôd say 4+ months from the start is a good estimate, as long as you regularly get your tokens.
---
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
---
As for tips about the game in general:
---
1. I‚Äôm kind of a hypocrite myself for suggesting this, but max out the brawlers that work well with their star powers first. 
---
I‚Äôm talking Jessie, Darryl, maybe Bo, I‚Äôm not sure about him, I maxed him out before the star power changes. 
---
I get so mad at myself when I see youtubers use their power 10 Jessie in game and dominate, while I had to climb to 500 with my measly power 6. 
---
Of course, personal enjoyment first, I loved my maxed out Primo with star power, but if you ever reach the point where you wanna get everyone to 500, consider which brawlers you‚Äôre spending your gold on.
---
2. Taking time to aim with that white aiming thing could be bad in some situations.
---
One: shooting behind walls. Just peeking out of the corner to shoot leaves you in some sort of danger, and getting back to cover immediately after shooting is a good muscle memory. 
---
Especially in game modes like bounty, where peeking out a second longer could cost you a Piper shot to the face.
---
So it should be *peek* *shoot* *hide*
---
not *peek*, *aim* *shoot* *hide*
---
The white aiming thing will get less useful as you go into higher levels, as people internalise movement speeds, ranges and hit boxes of the attacks. Then, they can just shoot accordingly, whether it‚Äôd be to zone, or to kill. The faster you internalise it, the better. And to do that, just play a bunch lol.
---
Two: Brawl Ball
---
Hoho, in a lot of situations, that one second of you aiming the ball could cost you the match. That fking thing should not be trusted when you are moving. If you are standing still, sure, aim all you want. But if you‚Äôre moving, that can be very unreliable. 
---
Of course, this is coming from someone who loves Brawl Ball with all his heart, if you‚Äôre not a BB fan, then this shouldn‚Äôt be too bad.
---
But if you like BB like me, then get used to aiming at the wall while moving and have it go in when you release the ball.
---
Wow that was very long, my bad. I‚Äôd be happy to answer any questions to the best of my ability though, if you have any.
---
Agreed, I learned my lesson the hard way. Next time I‚Äôll wait for a video showing the effects
---
Guy playing as nita in enemy team only have nita and shelly unlocked, thats what i meant
---
When/where is this from? This looks different than the one I saw from Kairos recently?
---
If you want easy trophies, try it as a gem carrier in Gem Grab. However, this is not a strategy for higher trophy counts. When you play Mortis as a gem carrier, it makes the entire game a 2v3 for your teammates, as you have very limited potential without the risk of losing all the gems. Higher up you're gonna wanna start playing it as an aggro, avoiding the gems unless necessary. Or you can play SD and run away from most fights.
---
That's really good.
---
I got my crow to 500+ with this match, so yeah! I like this brawl ball map a lot.
---
mk
---
I think turret characters would be good in this game mode, and probably frank
---
Also me opening boxes
---
that sounds like so much fun
---
He could have been on a team with one of the other two players. 
---
Lol game no give me loot. 1 Star. 
---
Did you get enough upvotes to post a video? we would all like to see it. 
---
Is there a skin there? Idgi it‚Äôs just a white picture
---
Ok well nice!!
---
I dont think so, in solo showdown i've seen similiar situation, low trophy brawler, low trophy account
---
The feint could‚Äôve used a spin but holy moly those passes were clean
---
You can do those quests in any mode not just ranked. I have all the champions so yes blue essence is nothing.

---
Needs a morning shadow to look more like you @CoachCoryYT
---
Good skin.
---
Bad copyright issue, sadly.
---
Guess what 
---
That's the point - before the update he was excellent in Brawl Ball - now he is just okay. Therefore I would have expected the chart above to be different.
---
Indirectly strong maybe.
---
Don"t use his no hat skin. Just don't.
---
But how in Bounty?
---
Obviusly.
---
Btw angry robo (or it used to be colt robo boss) has been in the game since September, they didn‚Äôt replace life leech with it lol. But life leech was fun. This map I don‚Äôt think is horrible, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs amazing either, definitely one of the worst sd maps though.
---
Thank you. Finally someone who understands. Throwers team but that‚Äôs about it, and they‚Äôre stuck on the outside or die.

0.24% is about 1 every 300 boxes though. But that may be a lot more.

There should be a 10% chance you get a extra trophy

I am at 6.7k and I have both the mythics plus piper. I want the epics badlyüò´. Frank and pam both are one of the best brawlers in the game.It has been a month now and I am stuck at 0.1104 legendary drop rates 
---
Doesn't really matter you don't own it and didn't make the app
---
Funny, i got him at 1400, thropies.
---
Good brawler.
---
Woah, what the hell is with Darryl's sudden mega buff?! He was like B Tier everywhere before! And Leon dropped kind of hard too. And my boi Crow is still not respected :'(
---
I just disagree on one thing, imo Crow should switch tiers between Solo and Duo SD, I find him a lot more helpful in Duo.

How did you get (or make) the mod?

Fuck leon and teamers 
---
Yeah but they could at least shape them like the skin. Make the tip golden and the big part red or blue, don‚Äôt see how it would be a problem
---
Omg I‚Äôm literally crying and shaking rn
---
Veeery old repost! 
---
I‚Äôm almost positive it‚Äôs that they‚Äôre on the same team. But regardless, a spread of 2k trophies isn‚Äôt anything to cry about. 
---
6ms
---
That's great!!! Can see myself doing that with my brother in laws. Gonna kick some asses! 
---
Overleveled
---
Ummm... No entiendo, puedes repetir, por favor?
---
And you still lost
---
Does anyone have a video to the exploit?
---
Git gud Internet 
---
Wow nice i can't wait to get crow he's the one brawler i want really bad
---
Actual cancer, you have shelly as your flair so I can only assume you‚Äôre these bastardly people
---
How many brawlers do you have? 
---
Hurts man
---
This tier list considers the overall performance of brawlers in all maps that are currently in rotation...
---
Bad because I don't have Mortis xd
---
Darryl is a beast right now!
---
You are all wasting your gems on skins.
---
I‚Äôm at one mega box, 3 big boxes and 65 regular boxes üòÖ
---
Primo isnt good in heist? Something's wrong here.
---
Do you even have the battle pass lmao
---
What about the shift of meta, do you like it or think it should be reverted to the old one
---
It a so they recognisable as team missiles
---
Great
---
You should it's gonna be worth it
---
That‚Äòs pretty cool tho.. no one else has her on 0 because you can‚Äòt drop lower than 35 or so
---
15....might push them all to 500 when i feel like it 
---
Man ive played this game since it was released on the swedish app store feels so good to finnaly reach my goal 11k boi üòé‚ù§Ô∏èüíØ
---
Thx m8
---
I‚Äôm about where your at but I keep accidentally opening my big boxes just because there in that bottom left corner. I‚Äôm sure this has happened to box savers at least once lol and yeah one mega from trophy road. Wish me luck. Good luck üçÄ 
---
He had all the time to get him. Just get into the open area.
---
Bull memes are fun. Not sure if good or of high quality, but definetly fun
---
It don't know about the shift meta but I think the game is better now with out Leon being the best character
---
Grabbing a box of tissues and lotion? 
---
Leon is still OP, being able to go invisible and has a really long rage with a very high attack.
---
the lowest is 26 then for 10th place in solo it's 0 trophies
---
Wow 15 and 7k thats impressive! I have 18 and at 7800, and I thought I was unlucky! Might join your band what is it called? 
---
So brawlers fusion dance is,spin around?
---
i literally looked up meme generator in the play store
---
Uhm nani? 
---
"Jhon"
---
For real, I hope he comes out early next week :'(
---
The meta favors brawlers in quick matches like mortis and darryl and suport that can help him like poco
---
Idk what is funny,  but the Caption Finally Feel accepted but you don't have a club
---
The verbose meme shall rise again 
---
How long have you been playing. 
---
Congrats
---
He does little to no damage at long range and it takes a lot of damage to charge his super
---
Now all that's left it to have some luck after 26 years of life 
---
unless hes good
---
That‚Äôs every night 
---
Ya the battle pass lol, jk
---
lmaoo
---
Killing Nemos
---
What do you mean
---
Ya I'm ok with it,  poco is finally useful
---
It's too punishing to some brawlers and too rewarding for others (throwers and Darryl). Maps shouldn't be so heavily favored to certain brawlers. 
---
Ffs i meant 16* and the club im in is pretty dead(because they all mostly play cr)i wanted to start looking for a new one 
---
The Shelly could clearly see the low-health Primo sitting in the clearing and yet she didn't go to finish him off?
---
I would do her 
---
Shshshsh 
---
I can see where you're coming from with that. I think there are some major inconsistencies with the matchmaking in this game sometimes. But sometimes you just get matched with someone that has stronger brawlers simply because you're better and they need that crutch in order to compete with you. 
---
love it
---
He was useful. At lower trophies but Pam outclassed him, now that brawlers are more aggressive, aka assassins, pocos burst heal really make him a formidable force
---
Sad bear hoursüòûüòûüòû
---
What is that one missing brawler??? 
---
How can I make his my ringtone too
---
Piper, a long range sniper have the same distance as brock hm
---
i thought it was at least more than pennys
---
**Excellent idea of skin, fits well in Pam.**
---
Yep
---
To be fair you have to be good with bull at a higher level in game modes other than showdown. 
---
He means pulling the brawler I'm general 
---
Leon barely dropped at all, in Kairos's "overall tier list" he was in 2nd place overall just right behind Darryl.
---
Bringing it back around, the reason Leon has such little counterplay is because of his range. A Leon can hit one volley at close/mid range to lower your health, and then his range is so huge you can‚Äôt escape afterwards. The only option is to kill the Leon, but because of his high damage at close range, this is almost impossible.
---
I feel you. I went from 2.2k to 2k. I was like "holy motherfucker where did 200 trophies go?????" For real I could not win any match for 2 days.
---
Is this brawl stars map editor for mobile? Cuz this has a different style from the one i use
---
Nah there‚Äôs a way to make it so you get matched against bots and that‚Äôs the exploit
---
Trust me when you start playing against people at 400 trophies you‚Äôll regret saying that lol 
---
Sound theme of this game mode... [https://www.reddit.com/r/BeAmazed/comments/amdrg4/hes\_a\_genius/](https://www.reddit.com/r/BeAmazed/comments/amdrg4/hes_a_genius/)
---
Imagine something more... let's say... dynamic... The brawlers riding horses, scorting a wagon or a train... üòÑ 
---
but 7 dyna‚Äôs in skull creek is okay üíÄ
---
That's fair, everyone is different. I just don't see anything wrong with OP :P
---
[yup, happened again](https://imgur.com/WKAgQL6)
---
I thought you meant for teammates/opponents on the match end screen and I was all for that too
---
To anyone that hasn't realized, his legs ain't thicc, he's just stepping on your corpse, and the POV is from the bottom ;p

My TOoLs AIn‚ÄòT FOr fOolS

I‚Äôm an 8.6k player so plz don‚Äôt hate ü§£

Not really gameplay errors. Just grammatical errors. Please don‚Äôt be toxic.
---
You woulda won if you didn't turn back towards him right before you died.
---
True
---
Not before = after the update. 
---
Morris isn‚Äôt Pele like he used to be 
---
Literally was about to say that lmao. These people complaining shouldn‚Äôt be they don‚Äôt know the struggle to say that lol. 
---
I think yes
---
Should have gotten more, the exploit in a game excuse is nothing but that, using an exploit to get anything outside the range intended by whoever made something doesn‚Äôt make it just because it‚Äôs there
---
GEMS, SO MUCH GEMS
---
No the coins vary I‚Äôm saying the max I got was 12.. beta player here as well 
---
Oh Yes. I'm sorry. I'm not a native english speaker. My english isn't the best. I only learned it in school.
---
I meant that max coins I got was 12
---
Same unfortunately 
---
I think he is ‚Äúsomewhat‚Äù balanced now. Maybe another slight damage nerf? But think we can all agree he isn‚Äôt as insane anymore 
---
Nice, congrats anyway 
---
1v1 gem grab wouldn't really work at all. The others \*might\* be fun but might not. I wouldn't mind 2v2 on most of them though
---
What do you mean? Hiding in a bush infront of an energy drink is not the worst strategy
---
*people
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Poor Crow and Piper. These two need more attention in the meta.
---
Piper is a little better in Heist now, but not enough..
---
I'm waiting for their remodels too.
---
I am in desperate need for the one who shouldered the extreme agony of providing me with nutrition they could have taken for themselves and though the danger of disease to evolce my fragile immunity to unprecedented level to be next to me at this very moment Due to the endleas dangera i fins my self into. I didn't look for trouble. It just found me, mommy 
---
El primo is here
---
El primo is here 
---
It‚Äôs probably a 8 year oldüòÇüòÇ
---
Yeah that‚Äôs true, similar to Tara completely turning the tables on the enemy team. They have similar character designs too!
---
If meta changes then that just means i need to hone my skills to counter it
---
Give me a Legendary
---
Oh no Big Box has Airpods on it can't hear us
---
Primo should be at least A tier for most heist maps
---
You sir, are a treasure to this game. May your name live on in the history books forever! 
---
Finally got to 300 trophies with Colt thanks to your map! Ily man.
---
What really pissed me off about him is that he can only load 3 rockets but his launcher has 4 holes
---
This is it
---
It's duos.
---
Man that‚Äôs some nice shading ? Great art piece!
---
Upvote,plus remove brawl ball forever,stupid gammode.
---
Already done
---
Primo looks like he tried sauce for the first time
---
Ummm, free speech bro. 
---
Not only did you play well you did what I believe is the solution to teaming. If enough people backstab people who try to team with them then people will start not wanting to team as much
---
Ummmm... I don‚Äôt hear anything?
---
The poco named itself ??? It changes it to nothing 
---
Will change my tag
---
F in chat for Mortis the pidgin 
---
tara certainly needs a buff I mean she is supposed to be mythic rarity its a joke
---
Hmm I don‚Äôt either, when I posted this I was able to hear the music. Lemme try to fix it 
---
This is actually a neat idea. It's modest and appropriate. I guess if Supercell objects to it they could always make her swim suit a one piece.
---
Ok
---
I‚Äôve seen a lot of people talk about a potential Capture the Flag mode.  This idea sounded like a great idea to me, so after seeing the recent post about a 5v5 mode concept, I decided I‚Äôd make one of a potential Capture the Flag mode.
---
The object of this mode is to capture your opponents‚Äô 3 flags (denoted by stars on this map).  The flags would be controlled by players in the same way as the ball is controlled in Brawl Ball.  The ball needs to be taken to your teams‚Äô home base.  First team to capture all 3 flags wins.
---
üòÇ in total I have 221 (big=3 mega=10)
---
Mid February 
---
That bull could've ended it all 2 times actually. 
---
No Iknow lmao
---
I was saying where is he on thus art
---
100% agree, and I‚Äôve noticed a lot of anti teaming progression throughout the state of the game.  People seem to be more reluctant than before, and if you get too comfortable, you‚Äôll get punished.
---
Go on... 
---
I mean i‚Äôm all for that but when the entire sub just says ‚Äúnerf leon‚Äù over and over again just to karma farm it gets repetitive 
---
What about drawing crow as falco? Or mortis as cloud? This is really nice and I‚Äôm excited to see what other combinations you think of
---
r/signitureinthemiddle
---
Daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaamn! That was some messed up shit!
---
Meh I‚Äôve tied before
---
Yes :(
---
Just saying I see some posts that actually take out the other 9 players. Leon is strong but I like when people post this because people will still think Leon is invincible running up to me as 10 power up Nita. 
---
Idk why no one pointed this out but to me that nita plays like a bot 
---
Aka 15m dislikes
---
True, to a certain extent. If you have him you definitely have a better feel for exactly how powerful he is. 
---
Yup i like this idea!
---
r/whooooosh
---
Probably 15 or something
---
Is not a repost. Is my own photo. 
---
Well the brawlers they counter are almost the same
---
They're almost all Bos
---
That's a personal problem. That's what makes his super a super. How does it make sense that you walk on spikes and wouldn't get hurt lol
---
Dont step in it 4Head
---
Thank you! And thanks for the ideas. I‚Äôll keep those in mind! 
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
But they‚Äôre used in completely different ways and function entirely different. Being able to counter a brawler doesn‚Äôt make them similar lmao
---
He's definitely still one of the strongest brawlers. Idk if he needs a nerf but, I think they just made the wrong changes. I like the nerf to his ult timer but his damage wasn't the issue imo, it was his reload speed. He should do huge burst he's an assassin, it's how often he can do huge burst that's the problem, and he doesn't get punished enough for missing at range, you can just spam him autos to build his ult. If they nerfed his reload time it would take care of both of these issues. 
---
This is very true, but it‚Äôs not Rico‚Äôs turn to get to rank 15 yet
---
"OH NO" "RETARDED"
---
these phrases makes me laugh

Did he pull out his guM when you threatened him?

---
Better yet, how about the missile get changed into a spinning dragon with his mouth open ready to bite someone instead of just a missile so it can really be worth 150 gems. 
---
no its a joke

i actually speak chinese 
---
I like the new one better

How does it feel good?

You must be sad or mad about something else

Cheers! Super stoked

I literally want to know how to create it first
---
I didn‚Äôt think of that! That‚Äôs a really neat idea.
---
Haha yeah
---
Then i want supercell to see it even with low chances
---
You don‚Äôt get the joke do you ?

Really? Wow, thanks! I have a bunch of ideas but I'm terrible at drawing. I'm almost done figuring out one of my most recent ideas, so I'll let you know!

The high damage up close is literally the point of his attack and it already got nerfed. His reload speed is also slower than most brawlers already 
---
His mini is like more than three times my main
---
True haha, well we'll see soon enough. 
---
Nice I like crow the best
---
Make this happen SUPERCELL! And also make it shoot pupperfishüòâ
---
That skin is most trash skin in game, but...good art

the face palm was right el primo
---
GET BACK TO WORK
---
This is why we don‚Äôt have nice things
---
I knew spike was up to something when I saw that smile 
---
I see franks rocking a pretty nice kanabo there. Makes sense considering his fighting style
---
No. I like being dumb
---
He deals almost half Piper's damage at long range. And recharges faster.
---
Brawl Ball is where I hear this the most 
---
You didn‚Äôt even crop it right lmao
---
That would be a nerf.
---
stronger than sauce
---
What. Can't see anything 
---
Yes it does
---
super cool! looking forward to the ideas\~
---
Bog spikeus
---
Someone has to be the worst. Also they are not bad all, it was a uial for new'er players, these brawlers are too hard for new plyes
---
Beautiful, Mastapiece 
---
Nerf leon range
---
im just surprised how high up mortis is, this is beyond science 
---
No other brawler can spawn a bear...

Why do we need to see the amount of peanut butter every brawler has?
---
Bulls and bows

Geezums why is she so cute

Omae wa mou shinderu
---
Crow does not need a buff. He is absolutely fine where he is. Moving his stats around will only ruin his balance
---
Pipe down supercell
---
This is a friendly battle u can barely see that he doesn't lose any trophies when the battle is done
---
Is it just me or does Piper look weird from that angle
---
Deal with it, back in my time we had to pick up and redistribute the marbles after a game. I am sure it does not kill you to quit and press play again.
---
Yeah because star tokens are a thing fool
---
U played with ur friends dirty liar
---
Can someone explain to me why Crow is S tier in showdown?
---
way to kill the mood üòë
---
I'd say leave Crow as he is. Bird has amazing control due to his unique poison ability which prevents enemies from refilling HP as fast.
---
When u enter a bush...
---
He did play with his friends if u look closely at the end of the video. He didn't lose any trophies
---
You still can play the game for free so its still free to play.
---
Would pay anything for this.
---
Listened supercell? You better speed up.
---
He's glowing purple because of all the gems he has.
---
Yee, figured it made the most sense :)
---
no it is just so funÔºåI love trolling
---
The latter. Losing 500 trophies in showdown, which is is a maximum of 7 per loss, would mean you ranked 8-10 every match for one hour. 
---
@Sandman3600 agreed! I think Leon could use a slight buff to find some middle ground. The nerf made sense, he was just was taken down to much.
---
Haha I would too, just posted the new one btw :)
---
Yes pls. It doesn't have to give us tokens just pls
---
Anxiety gave me leon
---
Lol yes, this is why casual mode (with matchmaking not. Friendly battles with bots and max levels) would be a good addition 
---
Thank you everyone for the tags and support. 
---
It is based on inflation, valuta and who cares. 
---
Provably just in a rut. I had crow almost to rank 19 then tilted down to 350 trophies in one day...like you, I didnt have sense enough to stop playing XD. Sometimes it's best to take a break for a day or two and jump back into it fresh. Stay positive and good things will happen
---
Every time a game adds ranked the game always becomes worse in some way tho‚Ä¶
---
I just want to have fun with Brawlers without having the feeling of losing trophies.
---
Also just to be able to play with friends, especially ones that just started the game or aren't too good for high trophy gameplay :(
---
I think considering how incredibly broken he was before he‚Äôs in a decent spot now. Leon should just be left alone imo and I think that‚Äôs what they‚Äôll end up doing 
---
Cuz its very amateurish
---
I see mama j
---
Why is there 3 billion spikes but only 1 normal cactus

Yeah similar was made by me lmao
---
A temporary damage reduction when he does his super might be something to think about. Similar to Darryl's super.
---
Already seen and already upvoted. Amazing job!
---
It yells "El Primo"
---
Hats :)
---
Ranked is fine, I love competitive gameplay and grinding but not having a casual mode just makes the game feel so bland and not as "fun".
---
If you under 15 your mom wins
---
He‚Äôs put on some weight by the looks of it 
---
Maybe I played longer than an hour, but yes I did only see negative trophies. I seriously don't know what I'm doing wrong. I'm using the same tactics and play styles like I always do
---
Good thing colt is good in everysingle one of them lmao
---
Thanks! :)
---
I resort to calling him Rico/Ricochet. kek
---
So the current play button becomes ranked, and they add a new casual play?
---
M O R T I S 
---
nah i like the original lobby music the best. now thats the stuff
---
This is really old. Colt, Frank, and piper are higher imo.
---
Crow is still at the bottom 
---
A better physique than Sasuke
---
Yeah I'll probably take a break, but it's just so addicting. I get frustrated when I lose, so I play another round of showdown, and end up losing pretty quick again.

OOOOHHH YAAASS!

Doood Lex gave you a shoutout on this idea! Good job!

Crow buff (394-450 attack max)

Nerf Poison (394 to 250)

To be balance
---
thanks! i tried create a map that works well for all brawlers except throwers and i really liked the result.
---
I want to kill her so bad..
---
no problem here??
---
If no one is in range the brawler will just shoot at the last spot you shot at.
---
best looking skin concepts I've seen. Mortis especially
---
#waluigi mortis

Whats with all these curvy maps

Yea I about a week away from quiting this game. This being one of the reasons. If its not bull, its Mike

Petition: Stop with the petitions. Just make suggestions. "Petitioning" doesn't make them any more likely to add it. Good idea, it just bothers me so much.
---
This is the same with primo for me
---
Bingo. Right now it's already "Ranked" anyway because you always win or lose trophies.
---
Not the super homie I get wrecked daily by trying to swipe a super fast and just do an auto attack cause I‚Äôm off by the smallest amount

Alright, I guess you guys all have a point. I‚Äôm sorry because this is the first variation of a meme that I‚Äôve made, and since I saw other memes got stolen by some pages on instagram, I thought we had to put watermarks on them.
---
Will take note of these 
---
I can relate. Not with losing 500 in 1 hr, but it does feel like the game has changed. I can‚Äôt play bull/primo anymore cos everyone checks bushes now. In the beginning, I only have 1 gem while everyone else has 4/5. The update may be a cause of this meta change?
---
i highkey love dynamike, im sorry
---
Yes please 
---
Why do you even shoot whatsoever? Gross "strategy" to deal damage! Banned from my Minecraft server!
---
When I see signs of Mortis in corner of my screen I run as fast as I can, he still finds me.
---
PunOko
---
how does it work
---
Hadn't seen the other one. Lol.
---
They like smooth curves
---
He literally can kill brawlers who focus on close range on close range. He is really, really op. There is no need to use a tactical nuke to know that its powerful.
---
Not to judge but what did u expect from "game doodoo"
---
Yes daddy
---
They changed the matchmaking system 
---
I have lost hundreds of trophies and all come from playing Showdown. Unfortunately DUOs is my favorite game mode and cannot stop myself from play the game. 
---
Take a break, use a different brawler or play another game mode for a few games. 
---
Good Luck. 
---
use the 6 little spikes to your advantage as much as possible
---
when destroying a safe or energy box stand inside of it so all 6 spikes hit (~3000 damage)
---
keep your distance 
---
And yet shellys always seems to outrange me when I play piper haha 
---
I don‚Äôt see why this isn‚Äôt a thing already, skins like wizard barley have their attacks changed visually yet skins like this and NIta ones maintain the same attack visuals, if Poco does shoot love hearts in his upcoming skin we riot. 
---
You can do it!
---
I will kinda steal your idea but make it "better" but i'll give credit
---
Frank - "pls love me"
---
Shaq in Shazam vibes

The ui before this was the best
---
The mortis tho lol
---
hes trying his fucking best
---
Thanks for the hat - Morris Gang
---
Are those PowerPoints in the middle?
---
That must be it. I am probably playing against players with similar total trophies
---
You don't need to credit at all... Meme away my good buddy! 
---
Or just remove auto aim from them.

---
I remember raging because I got legendary elixir and not a legendary brawler. It took me along time to get crow and I got spike recently
---
Hide in bushes, run when someone gets close. Finish off extremely low players. Finish 2nd 90% of the time.
---
Well they've taken out stormy plains before maybe they can get rid of this one too. Days so despise it
---
Unless you use mainly Daryll or bull super u ded not sure if it's the best map tho
---
There shouldnt be maps made for a specific brawler 
---
Thank you for believing in me!
---
:)
---
You tied.
---
Reply to the comments, he doesnt see it 
---
Unfortunately she already got herself killed before you could get to her, maybe we can make a queue to kill her haha
---
Trash.
---
There shouldn't be maps just for one brawler, even Cavern Churn has more variety
---
It isn't a SD map
---
It looks awful
---
Gameplay is bad
---

I thought of his super only.
---
‚ÄúThrows smoke bombs, where the bombs explode it creates a fog. Who ever gets in that area becomes invisible like the bushes for a short amount of time.
---
This super can be useful but if its placed in a wrong position can backfire. 
---
Ni√±o, deja de publicar en espa√±ol. Reportado

Don‚Äôt auto aim near boxes than. If aiming is a problem, get better at aiming. There was no auto aim before global release if I‚Äôm not mistaken. Don‚Äôt let it be a crutch.
---
Friendly Battle...
---
Actually, he uses an smg. The cluster bomb is his super.
---
*snake prairie intensifies*
---
Shut up you bull main
---
I know it's based on valuta, that's exactly what I'm saying, euro is way stronger than dollar, has been like that for decades but they act as if it was way lower. They could put 99,99‚Ç¨, why not, even if it's already way more than 99,99 dollars, but they increased to 110 wtf. Between 88 and 110 it's +25% for us.
---
And yes european players care, visibly you don't, probably only care about yourself
---
Does the game cost money to download? No? That‚Äôs right. It‚Äôs F2P.
---
These companies need money. Thank god P2W‚Äôs keep the lights on.

Darryl needs reword he can't be buffed reasonable to be mediocre under level 9 or too overpowered if he is maxed when his star power doubles his potential. 
---
Yeah, she doesn't need any sill, hopefully she gets nerfed so she actually recquires sill so only silled players can be good using she as she will have a high sill cap
---
Nice. Frank looks sad though 
---
Why did i read this in barleys voice
---
you can read the pic two different  ways 
---
Very very good
---
Cheers bro, it is quite ironic for my case becuz I suffered for 6 days and restored in skull creek, which is dynamike teamers‚Äô map.
---
thanks friend very cool
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇshit
---
r/elprimk better be a thing
---
f in chat for our boy Darryl's arms
---
But being serious should she get nerfed?
---
I‚Äôd love to see a combo of bayonetta and piper
---
Attack speed is fine. It already takes ages 
---
I always get around 2 draws each day lol
---
Learn math and basic economics and we can talk. 
---
.... you better not be f2p
---
Her super is the only thing that makes her decent. If they nerf it, she will go from bottom 10 to bottom 3 brawlers as she will suck
---
You forgot the amount that the spikes extend from the cactus grenade
---
I don‚Äôt use Bull he sucks , im a Colt main , I have 460 with him , but oküòÇüòÇ
---
where you live
---
And bo for me but only when I play on PC instead of iPhone
---
SC has said teaming is another strategy. SC has said they won't do anything about it. Stop crying

I just said that if u look closely at the end of the video, no trophies were lost when the losing animation came.
---
Please, explain me, I want to laugh. Probably a 15 yo gonna explain math to an engineer in math ahah
---
More than 7 times for me
---
Not another Bull/Primo meta map
---
I have a solid bet he‚Äôs being released at the start of next season, as most brawlers are, so everyone has a good shot at pushing him in trophies or the season.
---
I think I'm having a mental breakdown
---
He is a badass
---
yeh it was changed in recent update i think it looks great
---
Needs more Kevin Costner... ü§î
---
Ninja Leon would be more applicable than Tara. They all look cool either way. Nice job
---
I wish there was a "NEVER PLAY THESE BRAWLERS IN THIS GAME MODE" section so that he could throw barley in for Ball Brawl. He is so incredibly useless in that mode. 
---
Bank Robber Dynamike throws is bag of coins as the ultimate kapow!  
---
Bank Robber Pam has a coin turret that gives you coins per second (instead of healing you) hehe
---
I‚Äôve really been hoping for this. I hate always being competitive 
---
Don‚Äôt do it guys
---
You‚Äôll decrease my chances of winning
---
It yells.
---
A LOT.
---
No. Gems are good
---
14 or 15 of Feb
---
Ninja Tara would be so dope. I play Tara often and I really want to have a skin for her.
---
Yeah,I used the screen recording of ios. I didnt recorded to this pointü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
[Nope](https://imgur.com/gallery/ee3WwIQ) 
---
That would be fun to draw!  As much as I love Piper as Peach, Piper as Bayonetta would be really cool. 
---
so still, your salty, if your that good with colt you would know how to check bushes
---

---
Guy with star power wins. Go figure
---
It‚Äôs not that he does damage at long range. It‚Äôs that he can charge his super from that far, and that super is what will let him sneak up and get the kill.
---
Yeah I've been wondering this too... I guess it's because EU taxes are higher? But anyway SC is a Finish company, they could have been more comprehensive with their own continent...
---
This Oni Frank is insane
---
Bro , I wasn‚Äôt even talking about Bull just look at the question or are too blind (no offense) I asked - does Shelly need a nerf to her super and reload speedü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
All of these are really cool 
---
Brock got nerfed
---
What‚Äôs pb?
---
woo take tHE L
---
Because every once in a while all brawlers go for an all out peanut butter raid at jiffy headquarters
---
was this accidental, or purposful?
---
Which mall is this?
---
Not gonna lie about the last part tho
---
Too many...
---
just a typical day at the office 
---
guys hes purple cuz hes the gem carrier 
---
it's cool I want to be a character in the game he looks cool
---
Lol. Keep 'em coming!
---
Yeah isn't that what I said in my comment above?
---
What exploit
---
It‚Äôs from Peru, it is called  ‚ÄúPlaza Norte‚Äù ,in english: ‚ÄúNorth Plaza‚Äù :)
---
Wow you must feel great DESTROYING those bots huh?
---

---

---
