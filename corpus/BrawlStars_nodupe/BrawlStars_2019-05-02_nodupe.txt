It was 16 days ago that you last talked to me, and you can‚Äôt get a catchphrase right? Seriously go get a life.
---
Haha ur bad
---
Nah, I'd say it's the other way around. Barley's Star Power is better, his area denial potential is better, he is easier to use, he can somewhat defend himself in close range combat...Dynamike cant do these things, Dynamike has damage and can destroy walls, thats pretty much it. And sometimes you dont really want to destroy walls as a thrower since they give you cover but you know...
---
What grades you got?

I know how about calling a Beat off! Wait that sounds lewd.

Wtf was that colt thinking lol XD

The only reason people don't use that hat is because they don't need the power of it to win

So the other 50% you aimed all yo shots? Still nice with the cast on

Idk m8 I saw him closer to the end of the movie as well... /s
---
pretty sure that's the official name. when they were first introduced, that's what they were called in the patch notes. people started calling it Spring Trap because the first Gem Grab map after the update was called Spring Trap and it features the launch pads. I'm guessing there was a mix-up and people didn't realize, and for the most part, it stuck
---
That‚Äôs an oldy but a goody
---
My favorite skin would be the El Rey Primo
---
Haven‚Äôt watched him since I stoped play clash royal a few years back, how is he doing? I hope he‚Äôs still growing.

Well would you really want to watch a whole clip? He was just making it easier for us to find the moment he wanted to share. If you don‚Äôt believe him then that‚Äôs on you and not him and he doesn‚Äôt have to prove himself to a random stranger online.

This is a very underrated post
---
Interesting!
---
Sakura and pheonix
---
Rosa is honestly one of the worst things to ever happen to brawl stars. Her character is way too op and is just another bush-hider. Not to mention that her design is uncreative af, she looks like shelly and her moves and pretty much a copy of el primos punches. Just remove her from the game
---
Aww. Sending luck for gems in boxes now!
---
Lol it‚Äôs the same for primos (we have an unspoken rule that u target rosas in showdown before they can get their supers charged)
---
***YOU‚ÄôLL SEE THAT MY MIND IS TO FAST FOR EYES!***

Yup

This is actually amazing

U gata remember we are all randoms and we much respect each other.. except rosa‚Äôs fuck rosa‚Äôs
---
thing of beauty... the Wayne Gretzky of Brawl Ball...
---
uh, yes it can? you cannot go into the water, it is still a """solid""" object
---
This is why they released Rosa, just super and walk menacingly toward the teamers
---
Glad this meme actually is being used, it‚Äôs freaking hilarious
---
^^^
---
 Not trying to be a dick or anything but, listening to this makes me want to fucking die. I kinda like Leon as a silent character because it makes sense, he is a stealthy assassin. But your voice isn‚Äôt fitting for Leon.
---
The numbers would be inside the yellow trophy icon. Like in game.
---
0:34 when supercell needs Leon off the fifth time
---
That was actually cool
---
Leon please üôèüèªüôèüèªüò´üò´
---
*cries in dark mode*
---
Numbers aren't inside the trophy 
---
Its next to it
---
She can throw out my bad grades!
---
JESS WILL FIX IT!
---
It‚Äôs fake
---
She shoot your shits grades at your parents faces
---
you see, the range is insanely long for someone who is supposed to make damage upclose, almost sharpshooter tier id say, which makes chip-damage, also since hes the fastest character in game, it makes it easier to hit
---
Rosa won‚Äôt keep chasing you unless the Rosa is an idiot. So you can‚Äôt kite her. Unless they‚Äôre just a bad player.
---
Friendly battle.
---
The problem was that her Super lasted nearly half a map distance when she does not have any movement impairments. The typical retreat strategy of dealing with a tank does not work against her as the maps are all small enough for her to close the gap or score a goal with no counter-play. I found that Spike was really one of the few counters(can't really even call it that) to Rosa as he has good range and power. He can also  use his Super to slow Rosa down long enough for hers to run out.
---
Dude you're pumping skins out like crazy! This is my favorite one so far! Phenomenal job.
---
YOU'LL NEVER SEE IT COMIIIIINGGGGGG
---
Oooooooohhhh.... makes more sense. This is still broken af
---
That would make her useless

Hahahaha. Thanks!!

Somethings are not meant to have an explanation.

I know, the art style is a bit similar

at least pennys arent making the whole sequel bandwagon of asking for unnecessary buffs
---
&gt;	I‚Äôm kinda bad
---
Also, Shelly is for me easiest way to deal with Rosa
---
I reply to the notifications that appear on my homescreen but not on the ones with the app itself. I do reply but in a different way
---
I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs why he is op though, it‚Äôs noobs complaining that invisibility is too strong. The long range is icing on the cake
---
That spike was dum enough to follow u
---
Corporate needs you to stop using Android, lol
---
!remindme 18 days
---
I love how simplistic it is
---
I still always had a problem myself with characters supposed to make upclose damage to have ultra long ranges, so then again, it was onyl my point and opinion due to a problem i had myself during many years
---
Lmao
---
Not judging, just giving my opinion as well. We are allowed to share our opinions as long as we don‚Äôt judge them badly

Kinda but shoots 3 pellets all doing more damage if more then one hits you. Also quicker with random spread

Why do you even play showdown? If you absolutely have to play showdown then at least do duo showdown.
---
lmao yeah brawl stars is broken for toxic, afking, and just completely throwing the game
---
They are the same pictures
---
Nope you're bad 
---
This message was made by r/crowgang
---
Seems fair.
---
oh..
---
Yeah, but I didn‚Äôt have anyone to play with and I just wanted the star token. And I don‚Äôt trust randoms. Teaming ruins the game ;(
---
Jessie is pushable in some Showdown maps, but yes, she's more for 3v3 combats (and for weekend events regardless of the weekend event), and possibly Showdown is her worst mode. Also, why pushing her in Solo when Duo is a thing?
---
No it isn't a waste if you like to play with her
---
I propose a new nerf:
---
Shield blocks 50% of all damage
---
Damage dealt is now 430
---
Attack speed is 10% slower
---
Great template. But I will downvote because of your 2nd sentence, that makes me sick
---
You have less than 3k but somehow have a legend and lots of other rare brawlers so I wouldn‚Äôt be upset... just buy him with free to play gems or something
---
Kind of like the train?
---
Maybe if he sounded a bit younger than yeah
---
Expired
---
I know i told my friend to post and he is a winey bitch he added the 2 sentence i waked up and seen this he‚Äôs gonna pay the consequences
---
Wow. How many trophies?
---
I was gonna suggest that, but mid way through writing the comment I was like, ‚Äúwait a minute...‚Äù
---
Bosalah
---
It really do like that sometimes
---
If showdown is the only thing you play, then that's most likely why your skills don't improve.
---
The difference being one is a bacon-eating machine and the other a loli
---
Soooooo good idea
---
Atleast her nerf made her better
---
if this was already an brawler this fan art would get 600+ upvotes
---
You may be dont know that, she will charge super first.
---
Carl is my name and genocide is my game!
---
How???

Like this: *pyro noises*

Should have made the largest portion green I guess
---
She's one power cube away from being killed. How is that "a drop of blood"? Forced reference
---
You need proof, obviously. Which you do not have, obviously.
---
because barelys ult no longer stacks
---
SpOiLeD!
---
I mean nah
---
My total trophy count is 8k. My highest Brawler is Brock at 500, and lowest is Rosa at 250 (don't think she's fun, so I don't play her). Please don't pull a "hurr durr i have more trophies than you, therefore i am right and you are wrong"
---
Doesn't require flawless execution to beat her
---
Normie
---
This was pre nerf
---
Sounds A Lot Like In Minecraft Lucky Blocks PvP. miss the old days

Sweet!

Im spanish so i can't explain myself but,the badges you get when you have a high amout of cuos,how about a golden one with an arrown looking up for upvote and a copper one with a down arrow for downvote?

https://imgur.com/a/iCQA7ig
---
I've seen maybe one Shelly do it. I've never seen a Tara stack hers, and just the other day I played against a spike who stacked 2 spike patches lol. You're right, you don't see super stacking a lot. I guess that's why so many were saying "Rosa can get her super over and over". I was thinking she's not the only one who can lol. They probably weren't playing when Darryl was rolling all over the place before his nerf.
---
Oh I see the word play on this. Bohammed cause he throws bombs on the floor that blow people up when they step on it. Sounds like something that people who pray to Mohammed do.
---
I always get my mahk
---
Her super lasts for 4s, and won't recharge fully if you kill any squishy brawler, which you'll see plenty of in 3v3 modes. You guys sure like to exaggerate a lot. She's strong but not nearly as unstoppable as you claimed.
---
Downvote should be siege

As simple as this post is im quite happy for the upvotes since its my first time posting lol

Man, they spun real hard

Thank you for correcting him before I could.

Or just don't grey out the exit button
---
This sub has the most half-assed, misfired wooooshes of any I've seen. Everythings a woosh apparently, it's so sad lol
---
Nice changes, nerf rosa to the ground
---
You should have walked further away from them. The rosa widened the gap between her and the piper, making the game think that the Rosa was not teaming and instead, you and the piper were. Kind of a dick move by the rosa, tbh
---
We need this skin to be in the shop man. Really sick and nice. Hope to get animations as well. We really need a limited edition skin.
---
And you are 100% right. Because of this frustrations this will be last supercell game to be played for me. Games are made to have fun, not to play uninteresting and "justpushthebuttonfast" characters. I would really like to know who invented Rosa character. Who was the most responsible for it.
---
Thanks man. And oof.ur like 2 K more than me and no 500 xD
---
Good luck pushing em
---
Congrats dude! Feels good when you push a brawler to 500!
---
–£–∫—Ä

Can we have new animated skins like crow? We really need man. Will spend gems on it. And also we need more brawlers.

what'd I do wrong? it's my first post... :(

rather strange..
---
Right.

Hot fuzz
---
But the thing is... it‚Äôs a blend of all the modifiers and Supercell wouldn‚Äôt really want that
---
Piper sucks I love Killing her she's so annoying
---
*Metal Slug Vibes*
---
Darryl or Jessy power 8...?
---
Removed - Your post is too short, please expand on your title.
---
Good idea
---
If you can get darryl to power 8 I‚Äôd do him instead cause his star power is crazy good
---
Ok
---
Colt blocking that Piper shot at 0:08 was beautiful
---
I tried, but sometime it heals the teamers
---
r/halfassedmisfiredwooosh
---
Lol
---
/r/subsifellfor
---
I'm so happy there's one less person on this game that rushes into Rosas and feeds her super. Thank you for quitting.
---
I love it. Imagine old barley on siege.
---
how many trophies do you have
---
Nah it never heals them. Only if they are far appart, but when the poison closes in, if they don't kill each other you'll get all the healing mushrooms. In this case you could see that the mushrooms were following you so I think you could safely just go.

Stop reposting please

Your rosa is rank 36?

It would be a separate queue, because obviously you can't have "fun mode" players with normal players because griefing. Supercell wouldn't want to split the playerbase that much.

I paid 549 for 2. I've never really seen them for 700.

I played it right from the start, streamers have made it worst but it‚Äôs still a great game because of the skill required to build

That can't be above 200 trophies.

No point of saving cause ones the game gets updated you can't replay it anymore

I don't want to get whooshed but it is the worst map concept I've seen this month

Dynamike which have star power can just jump out of that box and throw dynamite to other brawlers

I love it!

Hahahaha rank 36 would be like 3500 trophies ir more

Im starting sorry i don't Noe well howto use

They are pretty close to you lol, only 1 guy have 100 more then the highest person on your team
---
I‚Äôve just quit until they fix her.
---
Pretty sure this is already a thing, people get kicked for not playing. Also have sympathy he could have lost connection :(
---
all my 500 trophy brawlers (penny,piper,brock,shelly) are power level 8/7/8/8.
---
lmao noobs like you who need star power to get to 500 are on another level
---
Me neither but you said in the text that ‚Äùrank 36 rosa‚Äù  what is impossible to get because the max rank is 20 and you get it when your brawler hits 500 trophys
---
That 10% nerf took her down from giving her 5x health to only giving her 3.33x health
---
Now I want to see more steampunk skins
---
May I ask what program you use? I am a huge fan of your art!
---
Thanks for the ELI5 so my technologically challenged brain could understand!
---
Different games, same situation lol
---
Shut up powercube!
---
Yes I‚Äôll pm u it in a sec I‚Äôm in school atm
---
The best part of this, is the fact that they didn't achieve their original goal - to get easy trophies. They died 8th and 7th place :)
---
Nicely done tho, killing teamers is the best feeling in the world
---
Someone finally made an edit for it
---
Hahahaha. Ok
---
When you play a solo siege and your teammates are mortis and poco
---
"not have time for aim" is a shitty mechanic that deserves to be removed
---
Well fair enough
---
Makes no sense in tbh I don‚Äôt know half the terminology you used
---
Definitely didn't think of that angle, If it is being managed by supercells networks than it would definitely have a large effect. If they let our networks manage it than everyone would be storing separately anyways. I think that if they haven't already given us the option I mentioned below it is possibly a result of software protections that most smartphones have an abundance of.
---
If you spawn in a corner and there‚Äôs two boxes where one is in the corner and the other is closer to the center of the map like shown in the picture, go for the one that is NOT in the corner first. 
---
I see people go for the corner box all the time. Most people don‚Äôt check corner boxes and they‚Äôre a lot easier to defend. In this example, if both me and the bot went for the top box, we could easily get it before anyone can come contest it. But in most situations like this I see people going for the corner box and then lose the other box to other people cuz they spent too much time getting the corner one. The corner one isn‚Äôt going anywhere. Get it last
---
And the sub reddit is at r/thatsthejoke
---
I thought that were barriers and when I realized that they weren‚Äôt, I forgot to take off.
---
Imagine being so low effort you don't even proof read your post with 4 words in it
---
I don‚Äôt see it üòê
---
Credit to u/Drag0n_Juice for the template!
---
Awwww
---
I saw this same thing when I was playing
---
That guy likes playing with his balls
---
Da, this is mod
---
but devs and people who design skins aren‚Äôt the same department...
---
It's mod

Everybody gangsta till mortar starts shooting
---
Carl, aw man.
---
So we back in the mine, got our pickaxe swinging from side to side
---
Side side to side
---
This brawl's a gruelling one 
---
Hoping to win gem grab tonight night night, gem grab tonight
---
I wish I had an epic. Maybe I should open a mini account as well some time and see if I get anything :)
---
BrawlStars needs a new chance system. Instead of increasing chance by the more boxes you open, maybe it should be by your trophy count instead. Will be a lot more fair for 11K trophies players to get new brawlers easier, as well as beta players that still doesn't have all legendaries.
---
S  K  I  N
---
What does drop rate means?
---
The worst part about teaming is u have to aim.
---
haha sure
---
So lucky
---
I didn't make it and it's not a meme. It's about something serious.
---
not to keep enemies away, piper will just triple snipe shelly
---
No... he's fine
---
\#stopthespin
---
The man needs to team to win, PATHETIC
---
##buffmortis
---
Heart attack! Too... much... sweetness...!
---
2 legendaries tho
---
You made me notice that in the manga crow is a pigeon
---
Then dont face piper on long range
---
But if they buff his reaload speed or range he will be able to escape very very easy and noone could kill him and then he would be op...Also, he already can escape from a brawler very easily and if he gets a buff in reload speed or range that would be too op...
---
I don‚Äôt have crow but when I do get him I‚Äôm gonna think of this.
---
Thank you, my lord.
---
I don‚Äôt think so, because they are not a direct measurement to skill,because you can team or get carried by people that are actually good.
---
It has no skins and was never remodeled, and besides the brawl itself made a joke (I can not remember where) speaking "well, it seems that the tare is the new bo...
---
User flair. It‚Äôs at the right where you see the description of the subreddit
---
Oh iknow ijust think if he had a lil more health he could be more aggresive
---
Delete Rosa yes of course ! Non. Seriously, what more ?
---
True
---
leon
---
She died of my super. Not poison
---
upvotes have entered the chat
---
Bur
---

---
?
---
Bur this poison boi
---
you should've aimed for the head
---
Its good for Primos in Gem Grab
---
Incorrect nickname
---
This so so relateable
---
but how else do you face her?
---
The most important thing is that they tried to do it twice.
---
This looks legit
---
I'm Italian and EVERYONE in Italy says ultimate, it makes me wanna die
---
That would be a really good idea
---
Yea too bad no one outside of the Ukraine knows that the hell that says.
---
Or nita
---
you're at 5k people have 10k without legendaries stop complaining
---
Holy crap I can't believe how realistic it looks!
---
jesus christ lay off the cupcakes
---
Yes it would, if you give him any more buffs he is at risk of being #1 again, arguably better than Rosa even.
---
COLT IS NOT A JUNKER
---
Happy cake day
---
rico rico rico wah wah
---
That's been there since the arena released, I heard it was a teaser for the global release of Brawl Stars.
---
PERFECT. THIS POST IS PERFECT.
---
bruh can you even do a math? are you stupid or some thing...
---
Its very good for sure but i dont feel like it would fit in brawl stars. But its very good
---
Penny
---
Nice skin design!!
---
Oh congrats! He's still pretty great despite the nerfs
---
Im working on it
---
**Mom come pick me up im scared**
---
I have 23/25 brawler... I only bought Gene...
---
Never spend any more money... Therefore, I am Pay2Gene
---
No.
---
Not possible rn, the servers will get destroyed if so many people watch their replays. They will lower it later.
---
Toma tu like crack
---
that would be so epic
---
Gene looks T H I C C
---
So you‚Äôre saying no one can pay cash to make their brawlers do more damage than mine?
---
This is really good. Are you gonna do other brawlers?
---
I love doing this
---
Micro transactions ***cough***
---
u risk getting trapped if you do it last, your screenshot is from duos, in duos just have one person go for the corner and one person get the other box
---
 Uhh
