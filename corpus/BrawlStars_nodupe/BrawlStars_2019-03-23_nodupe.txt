Hey supercell u have to put this in the game

Idk how you do that. Been stuck at 8.1k for a while now @ randoms

Teaming...might be a good thing. And here‚Äôs why:
---
I‚Äôm a big options guy. I hate things like L canceling because it‚Äôs mindless. It‚Äôs not an option, it‚Äôs a requirement. The same logic can be applied to teaming. 
---
1) Teaming is an option
---
It is. Every time you load in you have the option to try and create a team. That adds depth to the game, for better or worse
---
2) Teaming is a skill
---
I‚Äôve seen people who are good at teaming. Anyone can spin and hope they find a cooperative person to join them. However, cornering a person and then offering an out in the form of alliance is a skill. I‚Äôve seen a bull walk down opponents, corner them, and then spin... It wasn‚Äôt blind teaming, he deliberately got the upper hand against an opponent and then asked them to ‚Äúbend the knee‚Äù and join him.
---
I‚Äôve also seen backstabbers. Someone that will offer up a team, get close, kill their teammate and then move to the next ‚Äúteammate.‚Äù They get kills by tricking people. 
---
3) Characters benefit
---
Some maps are unplayable for certain archetypes. Look at the map with grass in the middle, the one similar to feast or famine. Throwers and long ranged precision heroes would absolutely get wrecked on those maps if teaming wasn‚Äôt allowed. With teaming, they can fully participate on those maps. 
---
Throwers get the shit end of the stick most of the time in showdown...they need to be able to run away and in showdown that isn‚Äôt always possible. You‚Äôll run away from one threat straight into another. That‚Äôs why throwers are so keen to team with each other. When I‚Äôm playing mike? It‚Äôs team city. Other mikes will just assume that we are on a team, without even spinning. 
---
Finally,
---
4) Teaming forces you to develop new fighting styles/techniques
---
When facing a team I have to think differently than if I was fighting a single opponent. I usually have to be less aim-oriented and more movement-oriented. Escaping, evading, and eluding become more important to me in that situation. 
---
Teaming can be very annoying and seemingly unfair. However, I think it adds depth to the game. Unlike L canceling, where a player is forced to play the game a certain way or face the consequences, banning teaming would force a player to play straight up or face the consequences.

I think she should have a range nerf, right now she‚Äôs a long ranged tank when she should be more of a mid ranged tank with the stats she has. 
---
They could buff her health a teeny bit to compensate since it will be much easier to kite her with more brawlers being able to outrange her.
---
He is single handedly breaking showdown mode and I love it

Mmm yeah that would be right

Its fair, dont complain

I wish I was tho lucky ;(

Wowow, so so real
---
I keep seeing people say it's a cool mechanic (and I agree) but it's also a really bad mechanic by all accounts. The goal is to pin your opponent against a wall and deal massive damage with the return, but no character will ever put themselves there even without a Carl on the other team. It only really works on stationary objects, but the safe and IKE aren't close enough to walls to make it worthwhile except MAYBE on bot drop.

The game doesnt want you to play 3 carl v 3 carl so it finds other people

Here‚Äôs an idea

Carls pickaxe speed should be buffed to what his star power is now. His star power should add a small buff to his super

Lost 2 chromosomes trying to read this

Man this was fun to watch, those were some crazy jumps!

Like gene is literally so superior to Carl 
---
I'm global only. I've bought Leon, Gene, and Carl with gems. Everybody else I got from boxes. I bought every special I've seen and in the first week that was MANY as I keep leveling up...

I guess my point is that you can buy all the brawlers because I basically did ü§∑
---
I‚Äôm betting he‚Äôs the only one who doubts you so don‚Äôt worry
---
Bruh
---
Yes but in low trophies there's not too much teaming and low skill player
---
This happened to me way too many times when I was inviting Carl
---
I still got Carl,  but if I didn't,  I'd have enough gems to get him anyway 
---
I think it's a really cool idea that you've got there ! Unlike other brawler concepts, yours stays simple and doesn't implies spawning swarms of mobs or other overcomplicated ideas ^^ I think the third star power idea is the best (the one where he goes fast). It could create a sort of hit-and-away playstyle, where he would put himself in danger to land a good super, then would quickly run back to cover to charge back his super ^^ I also support the idea of the bounces going in different directions according to the brawler's movements. I also think the name Mahoney is the best :) 
---
Anyway, this is a really cool idea, hope to see something like that someday in brawlstars ^^
---
thats the point
---
Nice

Yea that‚Äôs a good point I just kinda never play solo sd

Feels bad

Same, got him about 20 boxes in

the problem is that there would be so many underused buttons. you only need the joystick for moving, another one for aiming (normal and super attacks) and a super attack button

I‚Äôll do both

Nice

Ya know man. Same thing happened to me. I opened 75 small boxes and 10 big boxes. I DID NOT get Carl for some reason. HOWEVER..... I got Gene, Tara and Mortis. Coincidence, I think not.

Play like Rico, Play like Colt, *Rico player

Saved up 90 got Carl, gene and the bestest girl piper (so fun) but I didn‚Äôt get my first star power Da Capo even though I had a 90% chance

You forgot about the Penny that always attempts to attack the turret with her cannon, while her team loses the 2v3 fight for bolts. Other than this, the description is accurate.

Wait people don‚Äôt like siege?

I honestly love the daylights out of it.
---
Tired of idiot allies who won‚Äôt defend the safe in heist? Tired of primos stealing all the gems and diving? In this game mode both problems are solved, and you don‚Äôt have to worry about roles not being filled because each brawler can do what they do best without much problems.
---
Agreed . What if we remove pickaxe mechanic and change it to normal 3 attack where pickaxe Dosent returns ? 
---
Health regen will be like Norma brawlers + it will be more viable to use 
---
What do you all think ? It‚Äôs just a mere suggestion

&amp; im playing it at lvl 2 (obviously compared to max it‚Äôs weak ) but it gave me a thought that

He seems weaker then crow in 1 V 1s

Thx :)

No hate please

You can't get more than 1 brawler from a small box

Losing your progress every 2 weeks is something that needs to change. The trophy rewards system is kinda messed up. I‚Äôd like a better progression system. Taking a break doesn‚Äôt really help the situation I want to see changes made to the game 
---

Wtf 
---
I got him . He is pretty crap tbh only if you have reallly high power level and hit your double pickaxe throws but yeah
---
Gonna go with warrior but damn spinning really hurts my left thumb
---
I think he's well balanced. Maybe the star power is not the best, so I think Supercell should give another star power for him. 
---
You could be the one getting rape. Please be more careful
---
You just got him... I think you should spend time with it and learn its play style
---
BROOOTTHHHERRR

Nice job! I made a mini where I‚Äôm trying to get to rank 20 every brawler lvl1. Do you have any tips? Thanks!

Thanks Kemo! Still not sure if i should just purchase Carl..

There is a squad showdown, it's just called solo showdown for some reason.

Every part of your game is pretty cool,but one thind i don't understand is that shelly shotgun or boomstick whatever that calls only have one hole,how can it fire so many shell in different directions??
---
Total 2700. I'm a free to play player.
---
1 less token on the normal box and it would have been perfect.
---
thank supercell &lt;3
---
A good start would be to explain your problem in understandable English. 
---
The next step would be to contact SC customer support in-game and explain your problem, once again, in understandable English.

NBD
---
Yeah i love that bull
---
Got him from a total of like 20 boxes (:
---
I got first place as Colt while being chased by it for like half the match cos everyone else was scared of it and clustered tgt fighting each other. Just when I was going to die opponent Nita's bear chasing a Barley saved me, and during Showdown 5 seconds later the only survivor left from the fight amongst the rest was a 500 health Spike that I supered and won. Conclusion: Angry Robo stronk and unreasonable.

It's okay, sometimes I hate it, sometimes I like it

Yes, assuming that nobody else takes advantage of you being forced to run in one direction. The problem is not the bot itself, it is that it makes you helpless against everyone else.
---
You can get them with a % chance from a box so your friend isn‚Äôt rly unlucky to have not pulled it out of 46boxes or so. I have seen friends opening up to 150 boxes and not getting anything
---
But it would be much better if they moved modded SD to another slot (with Angry Robo along with it)

So accurate.

I wanted to have the Tanker, Healer, Paladin on the same team but for some reason Brawl Stars didn't allow it =(
---
Made a [vid](https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/b4hxu1/new_exploit_o_in_the_comments/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) about this. I gave you the credit :)

No one really knows where the boomerang they've been found in Europe, egypt, Australia, and north America but in Australia it like a national icon so that's why

Ok

Ok, and so ? That is a coincidence 
---
I dont have gene or carl nor do I want them, the only ones that I want are crow and mortis 
---
I guess so
---
QQ moar

Pam needs a nerf; indirect crow buff.
---
Cool

Lol genes trash tho

Solution for 1. Just aim manually so that you can hit them

Yeah :D

i'm doing them by rarity now

Most tier lists are made based on level 10 characters

Lol
---
Might as well keep the players with trophies gain/loss disabled separated from the original matchmaking so players fighting for trophies don't get crunched by a bunch of players not afraid of losing trophies.
---
Idk man, every time I play gem grab both of my teammates just stay back and do nothing or bush camp and die. 
---
I don‚Äôt think he is good either.. 
---
He is only good at getting away from a bad place pretty easy and just rush on underpowered opponents in showdown or with low health.. 
---
Other than that he‚Äôs meh

what kind of rework?

Nobody

I‚Äôm boutta hit the 12.5k 150 coin mark but I need those coins üåö

---
Yes and they repeat what you say oh thats talking tom 
---
That really sucks. But Supercell has no power in China.
---
You should be pleading with Tencent and not Supercell about the sign in changes. I'm sure Supercell would prefer everyone has a supercell ID and to keep their progression.
---
Ya I was thinking about this too. It's like how thee are "normal" and "ranked" game modes in games like league 
---
Perfect
---
Why do i feel like only the people bellow 2k get them? I'm at 5.5k and still have none.
---
How's Leon?
---
Mabey you not good with him
---
Should be an extra mode imo just for that..
---
Something like a team deathmach for fun, no trophies.. maybe gaining xp for that too.. 
---
Definitely needed in the next update.
---
That me when I play with my noob friend but i give up on the 3rd time

lmao bo

Hi, how does one win when they "team"? What exactly is teaming? Thanks

Maybe because he's still lvl 1 but still could do with a buff

Lol Carl is ass why did I waste 59 gems on him

They should have a switch at the top of the game mode selection with on/off ranked mode

**LET‚ÄôS GET SCRAPPY**
---
If u dun has his star power , dun run to a brawler with full health (except for throwers and low Hp brawlers like piper (w/o super)) and also important to wait until the brawler used at least two of his ammo before rushing in 
---
no he is balanced without you are just bad
---
plot twist: these two are coworkers
---
Shelly is around 18-20 and jessie is 15-17 nita is around 12 and leon is around 13. 
---
Rico is old(older than pam at least) piper is older than pam too.
---
 Well thats why rico x piper and leon x nita is a thing.
---
Have you considered making a second account? Whenever I get bored I go on mine.
---
I agree Carl is ass, feels like I‚Äôm playing a nerfed version of piper + nita

Dude please train your skills. Carl is a good brawler,use him wisely. Not jackin' up your shots like bull. All the best.

Brawl Stars is a good game! But will you give something to the players? Simply ask.
---
There are places you can go to find good teammates.
---
All robot brawlers in the game don't break wall and bushes.
---
Like a Discord right? I know there are but I‚Äôm just a casual player so I never really had a need to go and search them out. Like I said, I had been doing pretty okay with ransoms up to this point (a little over 4K trophies) but something has changed and now it doesn‚Äôt happen like it used to.
---
Thanks god they removed it no more duplicates!!!!!

It's time to start searching.

1. I can send you the video, but i don't think they could delete the new account from your email address, maybe you have other address? But i don't know if they could delete it

2. You need to go to the supercell website, then you go to support and then you have an option to write an email, i will sent you a video

Omg too good

Mhm, so with Brock you should try to lead his rockets, so that most people will get hit by it anyway since they won't realize until too little too late.

Meh. It‚Äôs just a star token. After I would get it I wouldn‚Äôt play it until the next one rolled around anyways

Now I can't help but wonder why normal Bo doesn't have 3 arrows

what

yeah, i just cropped the pics. didnt pay attention to order.

all robot brawlers have one eye and don't have mount. think about it

Ok, your call.

Even if crow `deals damage over time' his damage is still pretty insignificant compared to them.
---
The cool down time to get more tokens

Now everything makes sense

Lmfao

When we are still using the names of talented people in the community for upvotes

They should either get rid of it, increase the number of tokens, or shorten the time iny opinion

Yes, but I'm guessing OP didn't want to plagarize the original post, just thought that this idea was extremely creative. While it is extremely common and it comes up once a few weeks or so.

Xd

I got Tara and Carl
---
I can see many pipers and crows everywhere
---
yup, back in the day when the game was played in portrait
---
The fact of the matter is that there is truly something broken in the game right now. Certain brawlers or maybe just players are weighted differently. Perhaps it‚Äôs the matchup engine. But when two similar skilled players match up and one gets screwed every single time in a one-on-one showdown. I have evidence I can post. Bullets that cause no damage for one player and get extra damage for another. Add on to that The incredibly inept lack of customer service - closing chat without a response and you have a company that it on the precipice of demise.  It is absolutely HORRIBLE
---
My o my gedi, you did it again...this one particularly is amazing!
---
Fair, but if I remember correctly Bo used to be epic. I could also argue that Jessie and Penny are less unique since they both have turret-based ultimates.

I could see destroying gems being a valid strategy if killing the gem holder of the opposite team at their spawn area. Especially if other two are alive. A character that could destroy gems could actually be pretty nice.
---
I have many questions
---
Dam I just notice how big it is
---
His super is at least. 
---
Situation doesn‚Äôt ever happen cause I never team. Checkmate. 
---
This could be a phone case
---
There hasn‚Äôt been any announcement about it so no
---
So, i had 58 boxes, i got Tara, Mortis and Carl
---
nonono, keep the noobs as they are.
---
Bo used to be Epic. Then supercell was evil enough to move him down to Common then Trophy Road
---
Yea, she needs a major nerf. Keep her tankiness and her ability to heal, but take away her insane damage output. Her damage output is part of what makes her too good.
---
Crow
---
Jessie an Bo noticed the Primo-Pam action
---
P2W
---
For sure, no I was playing solo. I always have a hard time discerning other people's battle logs

not necessary.

You should unlock profile pics for skins too

Okay but his current bow doesn‚Äôt have any strings.

Hahahahahaha omg haha

Oh I see. I've personally spent about $100 on the game and still no where near enough gold for upgrades. They must spend a fortune.

But ive been stuck at 5500 for over a month, over the last 3 days I have had the game downloaded ive lost 100+ trophies. Played with randoms and team. I havent had a brawler unlock in over a month, the game has just gotten stale for me.

OP: *Talks about needing skill to use a brawler*
---
OP: *Is a Darryl main*
---
üåö
---
Alright, lemme explain. The idea is what the name suggests! While the teams are fighting over control of the middle, they also have to be cautious about something else: there are basiclly 5 lanes! Four of them have springs that lead right to the IKE turret on the team from its side. The bushes also allow players to sneak into each one and use the corresponding spring to jump right onto the enemy's IKE. This will benefit divers greatly, but it's not the only purpose of the springs! Ever been frustrated because you aren't fast enough to retreat and help your team defend against the bot? Now you can get back far faster!
---
Please tell me any suggestions you may have to improve this map, as it is a bit gimmicky. 
---
Talking about needing skill when you‚Äôre a bull main, lmfao.

What if Carl‚Äôs Star Power was slight but also grand such as allowing Carl‚Äôs pickaxe to do one extra spin at its max distance that deals one extra hit. It might seem slight but with it b eing extra damage it is actually better than it seems
---
But I wanna play brawl starssssss!!
---
It's ver y nice
---
THX man i knew that but refreshing to hear. :)
---
Imagine a Darryl rolling into that water :P
---
Same bro, I feel you. I'm nearly maxed out and at a point where all my boxes give me gold. I opened 80 boxes without getting Carl so far, and I still don't have Leon after opening 500 boxes or more since December. It makes me wanna take a break, but I already don't play as often as I used to
---
im not a darryl main, i just like having it as picture. 
---
Wow that's alot of money.. how long you been playing ?
---
I c 
---
I never saw one also stolen
---
What specific episode was it?
---
Talking about my Bull flair when I haven't played with him for a long time. Most recently I played with him and I despised what he turned into so I started playing with Leon and Barley and I'd rather play them than Bull.
---
But hey, it's easier to cry rather than learning to play ;)
---
I agree I‚Äôm the same but I‚Äôm at 11k
---
At least you got gems
---
Guys for another cool map go to visit my friend u/filippolupo i hope u enjoy it üí™üí™
---
*hates bull for being OP*
---
*Plays Leon instead*
---
Lol. 
---
movement speed buff while his pickaxe is out should be new star power, give him his current star power permanently
---
Damn 
---
REPRESENT
---
I got this on my own account and I was like whaaaat
---
I am also German But still funny 
---
Getting any brawler to 15 is easy lol. She‚Äôs easy o play doesn‚Äôt mean she‚Äôs good
---
With an app search map brawlstars and click the first app visit my profile for see my map
---
Crap, you're right... But if I'm a Bull myself at that time I could Super over it üòâ
---
K a r m a
---
Good concept but
---
‚ÄúThe froze water‚Äù
---
Yo I have been playing Carl sense about 10 minutes after his release and I think he is ok. To delve deeper into that, I think his main attack is slow weak and rather dull, so I think supercell should make his starpower something to the effect of faster movement speed and his main attack be WAY faster. So now his Super, I think his Super is so cool, fun, and it‚Äôs a great addition to the great brawler super lineup so on that front I think his Super is awesome and balanced.
---
Great skin. It would be more fitting if he shot downvotes;)
---
Try discord or showdown, randoms works 1/10. Maybe you‚Äôll even make friends. Showdown works really well for me. 
---
The Ice if you prefer :)
---
It's the people playing the game in real life, dressed as a Brawl Stars character.
---
Or ‚Äúthe frozen water‚Äù
---
I prefer that
---
thx! They‚Äôre supposed to be nerf signs :)
---
Ok :/
---
Love solo showdown. Favorite mode, but even that is a really slow grind. Unless you get 2nd or 1st, you barely get anything
---
PILLS HERE
---
Damn that is even better
---
exactly lmao, a month or two ago i got my pam to 300 easily without realizing she was still level 1 and i‚Äôm definitely not a pro
---
also i got my dynamike to 500 as level 6 a month ago, which isn‚Äôt that impressive but i wasn‚Äôt carried since i played showdown
---
üòî.. supercell has a bad habit of matching with the same guy.. i was teamed with him for 2 times and as a enemy 1 time.
---
This makes me happy 
---
Agreed
---
Imagine it translates to:
---
"You saw that Supercell tournament last night?"
---
"Yeah."
---
"Cool...cool."

8.1k with 19 brawlers lmao

lucky, i don‚Äôt have any mythics and i‚Äôm at 8.1k

---
&gt;Balancing brawlers on the best players is not the way to go.
---
Go back to school kid.
---
Play him in gem grab or bounty, use your long range to chip away at opponent‚Äôs brawlers and pull things like piper or the opposing gem carrier and blast them at point blank range. He is good in duo showdown with close range but bad in solo.
---
insane
---
Perfect for when you need discretion during those long work commutes, family get togethers or company meetings.
---
Yes, with the Peepee Tipi¬Æ you can now freely rub one out anywhere and people won't have the slightest idea what you're doing!*

And if you act now we'll double the offer! We aren't sure what you would do with two of these things but it seems to be a rule or something.

Lmfao you think crow is high skill cap
---
I though it started at the beginning of the match

got crow to 300 at lvl1 (weakest known brawler)

i have a better one

No you stole this from somebody else who already posted it.

Then quit.

Oh well in that case yes but what I thought was that It gets cold and then not cold and it repeats over and over after a period of time
---
Love this idea specifically the mask and arrows, love all your skins too, supercell should hire you!
---
Great comment.
---
I feel the same...brawl stars is not the same...it was much much MUCH better to me when it was in beta....I had so much fun playing it....but now it feels like...meh...I also feel the same with fortnite...its also getting alittle bit boring...I also quit overwatch because it was a dead game...and now if I decide to quit brawl stars or/and fortnite what should I play then? And thats the problem by me, I will probably not stop playing those 2 games because I have no choice üòîüòî
---
Oh that makes more sense
---
This map was made so every type of brawler is viable. For example: the pools of water greatly benefit sharpshooters, as they can fire over them but also make it harder for the tanks to get to them-the grass gives tanks and shotgunners a lot of opportunity for ambushing-and the walls in the middle are shaped like hooks so that throwers can fire and be better protected while under cover. I hope to hear your opinions on it. See you next time!
---
Either way this would be great if they put this modifier in the game dont u agreeüòÇüòÇ
---
What rules?

Tap on the three dots on the top right on the main subreddit page and choose change user flair.

Am I the only one that doesnt dislike much about him aside from the fact that he doesnt talk.  Everyone else has a ready up voice clip that cycles around, and I enjoy that.

That's a mistake on them if they start making idiotic plays for a measly title.

I think this is a good thing to implement, makes you feel rewarded on being a carry player. It encourages everyone to play skillfully to get a "Star Player" reward, it could also lessen idiots actually rather than make more.

Something which people noticed since it was released at least a month ago

Even better attack himself while he‚Äôs already dead.
---
At least it‚Äôs only $4.99. Mine is $13.99
---
Again, getting star player doesn't mean you carried the team.

HAHA YEAH TOTALLYüòÇüî•üëåüÖ±Ô∏èüòÇ

I was exaggerating a bit... only like 10 big boxes and a handful of regular boxes. But my friend went on, opened one box, and got carl. I have 400 more trophies than him and he more brawlers than me
---
Except Old Mortis is nightmare fuel

And he is not *The Bringer of Doom*
---
Thank you!
---
And his friends name? Albert Einstein
---
I should be up there I‚Äôm a good artist

I know his super is great, but that is only if you can hit. As i mentioned it can be disrupted by nearly every brawler. And it would be hard to keep him balanced but after you get to a certain point it is impossible to get him further unless you are a god with him.
---
This is your coolest one yet. I would buy this immediately üò©
---
Thank you
---
Skin here, level tree
---
They want you to pay for gold/gems to afford ranking up your brawlers before you can win. 
---
This game is thinly veiled pay to win.

How do you even get to 10000 trophies? How long have you played this game? How much money have you spent?
---
Why? Angry robo is a good game mod.( Unlike meteor shower, even though it does stop teaming. 
---
I feel like a good buff is that frank‚Äôs super can‚Äôt be stopped like Carl (no stun)

That is the only thing that changes his super from his normal attack, the stun

He does. He just doesnt consume ammo when passing the ball. Ik that's what you meant but eh

Hello everyone! In short, this map is supposed to encourage strategy and teamwork. Let me give you an example: Your team wins the midfight, and you take the ball. You could take the left turn (slowest option), or go right yourself. However, the fastest would be for one of your teammates to step onto the launch pad and be launched forward. From there, you could pass the ball to the teammate in ahead of you and let them take a shot at the goal, and as I said, that's what this map is all about: strategy and teamwork. Of course, you could also use the pads to play more aggressively, which is why I think both long and short range brawlers would be good here: shotgunners and tanks could stand where an enemy is about to fall to and easily take them out. And it's the same way around:they could use the launch pads, and not be threatened by someone standing to the fall location.
