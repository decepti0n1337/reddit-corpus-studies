More leagues = More free rewards = less money for Supercell
---
Ight imma head out
---
cause the ball will get stuck in the water and will take too much time to get through it that's why they removed water from brawl ball
---
Yeah the tokens were great, I dont get why we can't have them and star tokens
---
Imagine same trophies, same power level and color !
---
?
---
Firstly no. ‚ÄúCute couple‚Äù wft man. Secondly, couple, in any way, automatically means ‚Äúsexual relationship‚Äù. It means that there are some something, a pair. In what world do you live in to think a couple indicates something sexual?
---
Thirdly, no. Bold of you to assume I would spend my time going through a fake account just to downvote you. I have more to do on a daily basis than debating on the internet.
---
But you came up with the idea of downvote. Do *you* do that? Better not answer.
---
nice artstyle dude

Storage would go up but games like pubg mobile or call of duty mobile exists so its not that big of a deal...
---
Compared to the last one, this one is a major improvement.
---
Take my downvote
---
no
---
Very interesting question, the only thing I know is that they had to create a totally new model to make a skin, however now they only need to add new textures onto the default model. Sorry if this wasn't much of a help.
---
They're old icons from the old upgrade system from beta
---
#ok#
---
Wait that piper
---
I would call it scratchy scratching :)
---
That's what this post is about
---
Ok.
---
Why?
---
I think they're from the old upgrade system from beta
---

---
One is attack, one is health, one is super damage
---
Plenty of reason to push. Go for higher ranks on your brawlers-- there are 35 ranks now and most people don't even have a single rank 30.

Same üòî

---
I have crazy luck with brawlers! I just got Sandy after not playing for a few weeks. I now have every brawlers in the game!
---
He didn't beg all he said was to like it *IF* you liked it
---
The odds of pulling a star power is 1%. You also need a brawler at lvl 9.
---
Well no matter what, the chance of getting a star power is at least 1. It can be a bit more
---
Lets pretend Jessie dont show her hair
---
you don't know how to write
---
Hol up
---
Hah
---
Do u know why they dont have replays on any trophi level? 
---
Very simple bc they dont have enough servers to handle that many replays. Implementing this would make our "no connection" sign a lot more often thing to see, and we dont want that, do we?

Fair enough, I can't stand lone Star but ppl seem to like it.

What are you saying lol, he needs more buffs?

1. He has an above average win rate below 700 trophies in takedown

2. If anyone says crow needs more buffs it's only because they're rubbish and can't keep their distance, you just need to know how to use crow

---
Hey! This is a nice meme. I'm using it in my next video. :)
---
r/whoooosh
---
I would have upvoted it if you didn‚Äôt beg for it
---
my bad. There was nothing indicating that he was the primo, and the first time he said that he was the primo, I already wrote this comment.
---
It‚Äôs just, to me, I find more pride in playing and winning in solo how it‚Äôs supposed to be played and won. Personally, I find it way more skillful if you can take down a group of teamers than joining their ranks. Teaming just feels like a handicap that isn‚Äôt necessary and it leaves a sour taste in my mouth
---
I don‚Äôt necessarily find all teaming bad though. The one I absolutely despise is where people initiate just cuz they can. But there are two types of teaming I can accept
---
One: teaming against teamers. I pity the poor soul who‚Äôs being chased by a horde of teamers. When I see it,  I focus all of my attention on the teamers, not the one dude. I feel like it‚Äôs fair, although I will try to take down that one person again later on in the match once we kind of refreshed
---
Two: teaming against someone who has a big advantage. If there‚Äôs three people left (me- 2 power cubes, another person- 1 power cube, and Shelly- 10 power cubes), I will try my best to get that 1 power cube guy to help me out against the Shelly
---
Super Rares aren't exactly rare.
---
I‚Äôm the one that did not team, I had not other choice
---
You still can't get upvotes,this joke is dead

Wait. That's illegal.

Jessie can't do anything against close range brawlers, especially multiple up close
---
I drew a picture of your idea, go see it on my profile :)
---
And then you removed him from your friend list?
---
it's a PIPER
---
b r u h
---
I think curveball is easier to dodge than a regular attack now

but then whats the point of season reset, the whole point is to make sure EVERYONE gets reset to prevent trophy inflation

---
Okay... I made a mistake, I just didn't knew that there was THAT rule. BUT Its said that its just for fun.
---
Ah yes, I like this
---
Thanks for the feedback! I like the idea of adding multiple rocks to make it more like an avalanche so I made a change in the update log.
---
Depends on wut kind of mind u have
---
Emz is specially effective against the Jews
---
"Im sorry this comic is really good but there are too many grammar errors" lol. I don't mind grammar errors. I assume a lot of people here don't know english as a first language and they don't have a lot of experience with it.
---
There is a level 110 offer
---
I only get my brawlers to like 600 and a few to 700+. 1000 seems kinda worthless that's why I give up when I get them to like 900
---
Thanks smüíô
---
I was not prepared for that scream at the end...

Darryl works too

This is literally just a dog with a stick of dynamike and the canary

No, what is it?

D O K T O R, M E D I C K

Then you don‚Äôt have to ask for them. It‚Äôs dumb and pointless, by your logic, which is why I‚Äôm annoyed by the post:
---
Crying because you lose against teamer is for noobies too
---
You‚Äôre trying to change the subject. You were saying how it wasn‚Äôt something, and when I countered that you tried to change it to ‚Äúoh I don‚Äôt care about it if I like I like‚Äù
---
Don‚Äôt try to have an argument if you can‚Äôt take losing one.
---
Killing barley with super was first priority
---
True
---
Wow, now I feel like a god :)
---
It works.but only sometimes
---
ARE U KIDING ME,POCKET SAND IS THE BEAT WEAPON IN THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE
---
True though. But supercell it‚Äôs just not looking or he is just ignoring this stuff.
---
Me if you want
---
Same, really all I need is gold to get all my brawlers to lvl 9 and getting star powers. I already have all power point for all brawlers except emz and spike. I only need Sandy now.
---
Your welcome
---
Piper is ThiCC.Honestly though 9.5/10
---
Well the majority of the people who plays this game is like over 10000 and they have nothing to say if they have all the brawlers.
---
I don't push my brawlers higher that 750. I push them to 750 only to get 400 star points. I don't push them higher because 20 points for 50 hard gained trophies is a small reward
---
Nice edit
---
How du yu du dis?
---
Holy potato I am not Italian anymore, please help

Oops, well at least that‚Äôs there so no one would steal

Hey man, can i use ur clip for a youtube video. If so, upload ur clip to this google forms  [https://forms.gle/shDEwdChTFRA74VM9](https://forms.gle/shDEwdChTFRA74VM9)

And than they nerf him

what was the trophy count? just wanna know where people are actually this bad.
---
Also this is one of the reasons they should rework big game.
---
He is speaking the language of gods
---
used to be. got reworked into assassin but they forgot to change the title.
---
It's pretty high actually. Most people hover around 0.05
---
Yea I mostly draw females lol
---
Even if he's bad, he's not too far off from Leon at least.

Give link of your youtube channel

What happened to tiny spike?

Beta was 3years ago and that's not even beta

Congrats

Im literally getting triggered from these people getting legendaries while i dont have a legendary brawler after 1 year and tons of mega boxes
---
This made my day, thank you
---
*your ;)
---
Patricia
---
Yes it does....sliders would be even more difficult. If you skip forward a minute, brawl stars would need to perform every tiny action in that minute, which would take quite a long time.
---
Its the same...
---
Agree,but main of each brawler still gonna beg for mega buffs.
---
I have to agree on all of this.. kinda getting bored above 14.5k plus a couple of reports on this subreddit of own-goal in bb (i haven‚Äôt encounter one myself in-game yet) and Training Cave feels featureless like clubs
---
It's me
---
Dark knight Jessie's Origin story
---
Yes I agree I started this game during June and now I have 15100 trophies I am 400 away from my OG friend who played 2 years ago. I now get the point of season reset.
---
I got one sir
---
Just a normal day of crow not getting buff... Yeah
---
No game bugs would be 6:36
---
they be giving out legendaries like a charity for poor kids and those who have a decent trophy count shall be deprived of a one. Its written in the holy books.
---
Ok
---
But no one has a name like me
---
Wow was is Leon I like it
---
Nope haven't spent a penny on the game, I always wait till level 9 before using any brawler (dm if you really don't believe me lol)
---
#yes
---
Congrats! You need 4800 trophies to be part of the 1%
---
Send it ro bull gang they will be proud of u
---
Doesn't this look like him right now
---
Oh, hello food.
---
Mee too

This will get alot of upvote if you post this 1 month ago

This is the same with brock (the meme)
---
How's that possible
---
Mortis is dead. Frank killed him in animation. RIP Mortis.
---
Arrest him/her now
---
Lol
---
Funny thing is, the beta version of Creepy Harvest would‚Äôve actually helped Mortis in Graveyard Shift. (left green skulls on maps when enemy is killed which gives you 1000 HP each)

Supercell can't give you more points if that is the amount that you need to level up it to 9
---
Blabalbabalablublabla
---
But I saw posts that say such thing
---
Idk, i just liked the satisfaction of actually completing it
---
I'm talking bout try
---
Dynamike is in big troubles against Tick which has the longest range. And with Barley also since Barley‚Äôs shots stay in the ground. And if that is not enough I usually spawn next to Mortis. I have a couple of games today where Mortis passed me two spaces away when hiding. All of this is happening in life leach level. No good games at all. Was able to get him to lv 24 by only playing two games and keeping a long pause, then two games and so on
---
there's only one circle underneath dragon Knight Jessie and scrappy but Nita and Bruce have their own circle
---
But it would take alot of time. And there will probaly come another brawler in the same update. So about 30 of them... so it would take alot of time
---
What a shit post

T√ºrk m√ºs√ºn la

Yes

I actualy think is better now bc if you land a direct hit you will hit more spikes than usual

What about Coiled Snake?

There will be brock and piper invasion

More like bo's

---
Noo, he is OP
---
Nice dude!
---
help my tokens are cursed
---
Seems cool
---
Idk but lots of ppl dont agree that ranking these days that was the ranking of 5 months ago
---
No. The old model was obsolete like dynamikes, brorcks, bos ,and el primos model. They looked awful   and they were replaced with better models.
---
No I mean power points because f2p often don't have enough money to max all brawlers and don't have all brawlers maxed so they collect power points. But yeah sometimes they collect only gold
---
remmeber the old BB when there was a space behind the goal.....I still have nightmares  to this day

Still it takes a lot to deal with the Randoms trying to kill you and a bot charging everytime.

I like your art. But you don't need to ask for upvotes. People will automatically upvote when they like it.
---
You might even get less upvotes when asking for it.

Thanks
---
Yeah it's true but some people only kill players
---
bushcamping lets people survive longer as well
---
Yes you're like me you post a meme you don't think is true just to get upvotes lol
---
They need to make some fixes for takedown and lonestar
---
You are right
---
Or exchange star point to gold
---
He is just using the star power swap bug
---
Next, mechanized penny. :P

Watermark if you make art and don't want it stolen

Ok then

It's NNN  please stop. She is too sexy

Oh ok, Tara was ranked last in Coach cory's tier list and Mortis was pretty low. I just want to main someone because I kinda wanna put everything into one brawler, coins, upgrades, time, because I kind of want to get good and I don't have a lot of time, so I thought maybe if i just play 1 i could get a lot better

In my opinion, 500 before the update is easier than 800 after the update

Why are you so blessed yet so cursed

More big brain : still spinning after you score

NO. If you are thinking about failing no nut november, don't. I believe in you. You must stand strong and push through. Think about how good you will feel on December 1st after you completed the challenge, think about how embarassing it will be when you tell your friends that you failed NNN.

one question why Leon saying

does that means that he is her boyfriend or something

(maybe i sound like a idiot)

Jessie-why are you following me?

The thing that killed the sandy was the life leech not your attack
---
Then play a shotgunner if you‚Äôre worried about Mortis? Besides, he‚Äôs not that hard to deal with as barley and tick.
---
cute
---
I don't care if your little cousin, or little brother or your fucking grandma dying of cancer likes it. Its a shit meme, and also a dead meme. If its for your cousin personally show it to him, don't post it here.
---
E V E N B E T T E R
---
They're hoping to get that brawler so the name themselves like that
---
Because Bruce has some different details in his back
---
Do you want to super the entire enemy team into shreds or do you want some almost pointless boost
---
Ronaldinho is playing Brawl Stars now?
---
someone please say how to do this.
---
Rule 34 of the internet:if it exist there is bound to be p*rn of it

I heard there were some hacks you can find on YouTube like typing a code into the chat or changing your name to increase your chances
---
Congrats bro super original

easy
---
haha crow buff funy not overused funni!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
Bruh this is AMAZING
---
Yea
---
No it isnt
---
I got 300 brawl boxes
---
Totally not overused funnier
---
Supercell like say,that they kill trimmers
---
Haha
---
I didn't expect anything else but their naivety lol
---
33% He is separate with Nita 
---
33% He is not a Teamer 
---
33% He is too thick
---
So you don‚Äôt get the regen if you were the last one to hit him and they die? It even says I killed them in the top left.
---
God daaamn you‚Äôre so defensive about it. So what if people do it? The team is split 50/50 on it and it‚Äôll keep happening till supercell bans it or does something to stop it. No point harassing your friend cuz of it, he‚Äôs just trying to get trophies.
---
I hope that nota doesent sees this

Turn around and look up

K but i rlly prefer shocky over energize since you waste ammo

open some paths on up and bottom (avoid 1 tile gaps)

it looks kinda like oingo boingo artstyle lmao
---
No it's not photoshopped, I was playing colt in friendly game and this happened, but it can be a bug too
---
So cavern churn but on steroids
---
F. He'll always be remembered
---
HAHAHA What is an oingo boingo artsyle?
---
These words killed me rn. Pls explain

oh it's a sleeping spike

I thought he was looking dissapointed

Oh then I dunno prolly a bug. There‚Äôs no way supercell did this on purpose

Me:laughs in 11k trophies

Actually this is not correct. Every Brawler that has been remodeled, has a different type of 3D model than original models (Crow &amp; Pam). Skins for Remodeled Brawlers can be made on top of the 3D model of the remodeled Brawler, while for og models, you would have to build a new model for every single skin. So, Supercell makes skins for remodeled Brawlers by building those extra textures on to the default model, instead of building a complitely new model for every single skin.

Like i said, What if nita was a sister in law ? ü§î

What is the purpose of this post?

Also emz:upvote this

You are not wrong

Ok nice, i ll watch it maybe ;)

Matchmaking doesn‚Äôt go off power points or overall trophies, it goes off of trophies for the one character. It can lead to some pretty off games but with their system it‚Äôs pretty balanced

Wasn‚Äôt calling you a noob, was just curious what trophy level you were using your Jessie at. Things work differently at different trophy levels.

I ll draw something else in future ;)

Only if i have a good idea like this one

Yay I got a quote right! Was hard to understand her

If you mean in total then 19k. If you mean on Pam, I haven‚Äôt played her since that screenshot
---
That damn mariachi...

lol lets say 9/10 8)
---
Oop, my b for starting this conversation
---
*laughs in 19.5k karma*
---
Yes mostly that but getting 40% less damage than some kind of small buff to speed is better. Most pro players agree on that protective pirouette is the better one. You dont need a healer on your team now. And your unstoppable with your super (almost)
---
OMG, THAT'S AWESOME!!! PUT HIM IN GAME

Emz is giving them some detox

Although the art is really awesome, you missed the chance to make the battery 69% and the time 4:20

3. Whats the rarity and how do you get her?

4. whats her damage and how does she attack? (This question is optional)

I want twist and shoot maybe just in freindly battles and a carl buff

Time to change my flair to Leon or Carl-- Also, h o w  d a r e  y o u  call Bibi a thot
---
Literally the exact same thing happened to me
---
Why Nita looks uncomfortable? And where is leon's left hand?
---
It USED to be 18+
---
That spike tho, I‚Äôm dying
---
Ok, sorry if i sounded rude in last comment but I'm always that one person who doesn't get the joke
---
I don't know where you heard that, but most pros agree on Power Throw. And it's really not small at all. It makes a huge difference. You're throwing twice the amount of attacks in a game than before, over making 1 good play with a super.
---
I completely forgot about Twist and Shoot. Was it Showdown or Gem Grab?
---
8bit
---
But how
---
Wouldn't say she is stupid she just didnt know that el primo would have his super up so fast
---
Love it
---
Bye bye
---
I fucking hate that mode. Its literally: Who can steal the most kills?
---
THICO
---
I know,this happening to me.
---
sure
---
but couldnt she have just fired a shot at the end
---
No. Why are you so obsessed with 1k?
---
No cause of reload time and the attack doesn't shoot insantly.
---
The original post is like 6 months old. Trying to be sneaky, huh
---
I can hear ur parakeet
---
I didn‚Äôt read the name of the post and I was like you‚Äôre REALLY new to the game if you think dyna is that bad
---
Al fin un espa√±ol
---
The horrifying creature is that crow thing
---
sorry could you explain it clearer im too dumb to understand
---
Leon saw things
---
The second one happens to me a lot, i have like 4-5 videos of it with different brawlers
---
good at least you made him thiccccccc :D
---
It's free to use?
---
Ye he thicc
---
Yea.. i was thinking the same.
---
#How the fuck do I keep finding you
---
Oh. Well I comment a lot?
---
this is extreme
---
Shelly shot out a bullet when el primo supered, henceforth making her miss and wait 1.5 seconds for it to reload while el primo has his attacks ready. When shelly has her attack ready, she still cant kill him cause of the unload time.
---
The Snake Prairie element is a bit of a question mark but I like the Corner Case part
---
Happened a strange thing to me too, i shooted away the ball with the super before the enemy Frank landed his super on me and the ball got shooted backwards and i almost scored in my own goal
---
Not pure luck, just try because they will underestimate you giving you an advantage
---
You're a good Guy sir :D
---
You're complaining I mean I understand you wanted mortis this but you're complaining you got a legendary
---
Mega idea
---
If this actually happened I will play it
---
Cool drawing
---
Yes that is exactly what he was talking about
---
How have you been playing long enough to get a brawler to Rank 20 and yet you still don't realize that the Shelly and the Mortis are friends
---
No, he is just Polo(*i*)
---
starts to explode from the bottom up, watches Shelly move, she goes straight to the bombs ... she should have taken damage and Piper would have killed
---
Oh no...
---
I am so touched by this book. This is a masterpiece!
---
What rank is your dynamike? It‚Äôs takes no skill so you should have no problem getting trophies for him if you want to prove your point
---
Agreed. Matchmaking is based on trophies not power. At least it's not cod mobile where matchmaking is based on how much you play.
---
MMMMHMMM he "HAD" 8bit
---
I would penetrate him. I think he would enjoy it.
---
Not really. But she have the most fan art I guess
---
Nice idea thanks
---
I like Nita decent range fast reload a good all around brawler
---
A deeper version of penny's laugh? Couldn't have spent more time on the voice, huh?

Thank you this is some of my best work. My favourite quote is Bla blablah Bla."

Why do you keep saying you don‚Äôt need a barely when we are talking about dynamike? I just think that if you‚Äôre gonna call a character op you should at least be able to play it first
