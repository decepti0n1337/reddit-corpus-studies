i think stalling would be a major problem: primo can‚Äôt beat a shelly, but he can outrun her and just keep running. In bounty this is fixed by having a star in the middle, but how do you motivate two players to attack each other even if they‚Äôre at a disadvantage.
---
I would totally run away from someone if i can save 8 trophies that way. 
---

---
How do you beat someone with a longer range?
---
If they‚Äôre getting gems, bolts or whatever you can make plays, but how do you attack a piper when you‚Äôre a gene and they have no reason to get closer to you, or let you get closer? 
---
Both being the same brawler would result in boring games and not being the same brawler is unfair and boring in most cases too.
---
piper vs piper would be cool tho, other than that, don‚Äôt think this will happen, and there are more reasons than this one that it wont happen.
---
brawl stars‚Äô games are not about getting kills (except for maybe showdown, and look how well people stick to the objective of killing everyone and not teaming there) with good reason.
---
---
---
Better to play with friends. At least for now.
---
What am I suppose to do with that
---
Nao tem br
---
Lol
---
No the barley and piper has lowest trophies and lower power level and the penny has higher trophies and higher power level so I don‚Äôt understand what u are talking about??
---
Nononono I premade a list so everything should be like rock, paper, scissors scenario. For example Shelly counters Nita, Nita counters Colt, Colt counters Shelly.
---
Yes! I was waiting for someone with this idea.
---
So you would have just ignored that one hit from death gene with 3 gems literally next to you and wouldn't have attacked him?
---
this Monday or next one?

UMMMM sorry buttt HOW IN THE WORLD DOES HE HAVE 764 TROPHIES IF EVERY BRAWLER HAS 0 TROPHIES EXELT LEON WITH 8 TROPHIES
---
How'd you land that job?
---
Maybe only 10 second downtime between rounds.
---
3 gems is not worth going that deep into their spawn while someone's respawning and suiciding. You had great middle control, you gave them the game.
---
Throwers are gonna be a little too strong
---
Ok didn't know they already made one

Thanks, man! I put the link to my map in my main comment; the website is called PixelCrux. It *may* have an app, but I'm unsure.
---
Damn this is so sad... i hope my pals doesnt desapear like that, please tell to is if re re-apear.
---
Not that there‚Äôs anything wrong with that
---
I‚Äôm shaking
---
I think it happens because you hit all 4 bots at once, which instantly recharges your super. It‚Äôs weird, though, that you can super again by attacking.
---
i checked your profile, cant find it, im too tired maybe to see where to look, link me?

Talk about bias. You haven't seen a single second of gameplay. You've seen a single screenshot (from pre-beta as well) and you've decided the game looks like crap. Ok sir.
---
Just a heads up this post took us a week to make so before even starting on the text we obviously went through every problem we could think of and tried to make this as fair as possible!
---
E
---
This was not my question, thanks captain obvious now I also know that it was a fucking stupid idea. If I did escape it probably saved the game cause guess what 3v2, do you think you can keep control for 6 gems? My questiom was would you not have done it? Knowing that in a 3v2 you probably can't hold control for a decent ammount of time anyway and it would be an almost guranteed win if you managed to escape, would you have not done it?
---
That‚Äôs Low plus u have bandaid

I love the concept of brawler steps being offered. It really helps to avoid complete mismatches and the fact that a player gets to choose from 3 brawlers reduces the RNG by a lot. Now this gamemode would be practical. This would encourage players to master each brawler as well as let them show their 1v1 skills without external influences. Great job my dude.
---

That's funny shit

This mode would be great
---
This is funny
---
...What do you mean "Too big"? It's a Showdown map. This is the correct size *for* a Showdown map.
---
You got to act handicap to help the handicap
---
Power cubes would make the fight unfair. Dual mode should be where 1v1 skills can shine.
---
It looks like you could go semi mid you can camp with all those bushes
---
If they added this,Brawl Stars will be 13+ (just saying)
---
Depends on brawler but yeah I see where your coming from
---
Pipers like this allot
---
Lmao imagine the chaos in this mode
---
Nicely done! :D
---
The way this scenario is set up is so that if you pick the right brawler then you can have a better shot at winning... but you can still win with a different brawler. Obviously if you pick mortis and your opponent picks dynamite you‚Äôre probably going to have an easy time killing them, but that doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt get beaten because a few good dynamite throws will
---
kill a mortis. It‚Äôs similar to showdown... I can get into a game as a primo and all my opponents be shelly, or I can get into a game with primo and all my opponents can be poco. There‚Äôs a lot of luck with that to and yet it still works out, just because I verse all shelly doesn‚Äôt mean I can‚Äôt win!! This is setup so that there‚Äôs a luck factor but also a very high skill factor and it‚Äôs a genius game mode and something different than most of the game modes.

Anyway the subreddit could have a "live tracker" where subscribers can enter their supercell info and have a post showing the most gained trophies in the current season? It the biggest current win streak, or best KD ratio for the season. So many ideas if you could link the subreddit to accounts somehow

Your idea is bad because it effectively discourages pinching/sandwiching which is one of the main ways the Brawler count drops. Bush camping is what opportunistic players do. Sure they are probably gonna lose once the game gets to 5 or 6 brawlers remaining due to their low power cube count, but on the other hand, with a successful bush camp, they can either get top 3 by doing nothing or get the jump on people who decided not to bush check and become a threat on the field. The idea also limits what kind of brawlers are gonna be played. People are gonna play even more Shelly and long-ranged brawlers rather than Bull or Mortis. 
---
SD is fine the way it is, catering towards multiple playstyles and many (if not all) brawlers.

No that's a lie I don't find any enjoyment knowing that I'm sitting at 14123 with 23 brawlers, fully knowing well that I have a 0.096% legendary drop chance and missing Gene. I also do not appreciate how I need to push my already pushed characters when I could have easily gotten 1 of 4 of the remaining brawlers and finished trophy road to get that sweet sweet 150 gold.

I think the duel should be more like Tag way. Back in tekken tag where you could just switch to your 3 selected brawlers - also like Pokemon raid. So when you are about to die on that specific brawler, switch to other one.

No me and mortieboi are brothers,make sure to like,I also posted this on my reddit
---
I got Rosa, Leon, and tick all to 500 the week they released and could easily push new brawlers to 500 in two weeks if I had the time. That was before the trophy change and I considered myself a casual player. It‚Äôs not abnormal at all and most people below 10k, as I have said before, are typically not very skilled making it easy for even average players to get into the mid to high trophy ranges. Getting brawlers to 500 isn‚Äôt the issue, it‚Äôs everything after that that‚Äôs to easy, making pushing to 20k a common thing.

Ive won a mortis many times with barley! üòÇüòÇ And then coiled snake came.

Go and read the text post regarding duel on u/OfficialHields profile!
---
True
---
Ayyy brotha! Glad you like it.
---
Go and check out the analysis on u/OfficialHields profile!
---
That Nita tried to kill you but failed miserably
---
Better than those guys that immidiately run in with no hp and then grab the cubes and die
---
If there is any brawler having min. 400 trophies in the game, then replay is available for all participants. Like this spike having 410 trophies in your case.
---
if you talk to me then yes because i push them one by one and i push a specific brawler to the next rank and then i move to another brawler
---
All brawlers should be viable in all gamemodes
---
yeah their rush wars mortar is broken AF
---
That sad
---
And with CR/BS boxes
---
Agree
---
^what?
---
you got a point there

I fink it was be old Ricochet

Why is this here

Facts, it's disappointing

Thanks Shello ‚úåÔ∏è

So it‚Äôs basically ‚Äòa geisha‚Äô ( you can google it ) but creepy, add in an ‚ÄòAsian‚Äô umbrella then boom. A creepy ass piper.

Damn your like one of the most luckiest people in brawl stars

my day is imeasurable and my disappointment is ruined

Don‚Äôt be greedy for legendaryies
---
Neh
---
Thats really good editing, take my updoot
---
OH GOD THATS WHAT PIPER LOOKS LIKE AT FULL RANGE *SCP-096 would like to know your location so does the FBI*
---
you know that "berserker" is something present in countless games and it's always the same thing: low hp = high damage
---
Can't hear
---
Call it whatever you want. It‚Äôs still a way to rush thru the stages very quickly.
---
Big oof
---
soooooooooooo sarcastic
---
Meh

well until we either get a general sub (unless we have one and no one knew) or an RW one we cant do much (shrug)

You turned on the sound right?

I can finally beat up a random with just my own skills!

Uno reverse card? Also F for Tara because she didn't say UNO! and Piper found out so Tara got a penalty of 2 Card :D *happy sound effect*

I find it hard to aim perfectly against a Mortis with Coiled Snake.

it's either today or tommorow

exactly that's how i do it

Brawl Stars is a great game.Rush Wars can't stand any chance.Just my opinion.
---
I'll call it an error in the matrix
---
Damm

dynamikes and teams at the showdown would be electrocuted all the time

Hold up 1k after season finished!

Boi I can't play Rush Wars in my country. Frick you Supercell
---
That's not for me to say, listen yo tour heart.
---
To be perfectly honest Rush Wars looks.. vaguely intresting? I'm kind of mixed on the charcter design. Some look cool, others look lame. Other than that i don't really have an opinon yet
---
Inspired by Annabelle
---
I have 8600 trophy, no legend(¬¥ÔΩ•_ÔΩ•`)

Oh no, she's gonna rip newbies apart with her band-aid and super

So this takes 1 whole minute, and the Shelly must be a fuckin' idiot to let you continue doing it. Got it.

This subreddit definetly needs to have more competitive or serious discussions about brawlers

Compared to other Supercell games, Brawl Stars has the uniqueness.

Ik?! Sounds something dutch in hhere....

Ok man , tell me who you stole this from

This is how I got mortis. I still have a screenshot
---
Hahahahah I love Brawl Stars but, please, do not compare to Clash Royale. BS is a casual game, clans are useless and is easy to get trophies at showdown. Clash Royale is competitive, you always afraid to lose trophies and the games after 6k are tough, you must concentrate to win.
---
This is how it works.(Taka raboti).
---
The new game looks boring
---
Damn, good shrimp
---
Hmm..This could be an idea for spike's 3 rd star power..if 3rd star power will be added..
---
Creepypasta Jessie
---
i mean the in-game model's neck is also like that lol
---
good idea
---
And it comes at a great price! It's free!
---
Where is the brawl talk üò≠üò≠
---
Technically is since the game was supposed to be the next brawlstars.
---
You can contact supercell, but i think you're just too unlucky, like me when i couldn't find any legendary, but you're in a worse situation so i don't know, just hope

I'm on Insane X just using Band Aid Shelly. I beat Insane IX with two other Band Aid Shellys lol.
---
There already a Rush wars subreddit

I dont remember the thing :D

and band aid should be renamed as "immortality"

It's from the google play

The problem with you guys is you push without rewards, even when the token prize is 0/200.
---
I know people who play just for tokens and have much more succes in new brawlers than someone who pushes without getting tokens.
---
Most likely. HD and BB just don't have as strong of a player base

Errathicc blocks+double trouble looks good

not being salty or anything but bruh .. what you think about the balancing?

But Hay Day is farm theme and Boom Beach is millitary themed and they're still Supercell game.

I haven't got a brawler from a box sense Bibi. I have terrible luck, and I'm getting tired of playing the same brawlers. Like where can I contact supercell?

In the options, there is a support button, you can send a message there, but i think he will say you just to wait, like me

Tbh I would rather have the actual default skin than any other. Especially here, where it doesn't look like a phoenix but more like a weird duck.
---
Yes,a big buff...Like reduce the recharge time from 20 secs to 0.00000000001 secs
---
The "Stop asking for brawltalk" are way more often and also way more annoying than the actual posts asking for brawltalk... because I haven't seen a single post asking for brawltalk
---
I would like there to be a way to find teammates here, so that we don't end up on some bots' team. Perhaps we all could do this under the live comments section, where all of us could see who would like a teammate at that time.
---
Start by posting our region, brawler trophy/power count and gamemode that you would like to play.

Removed - You have a negative karma score, please fix this before posting again. This action is to prevent spam on the subreddit.
---
That's really a lot! Nice!
---
Noiceee
---
Cool :)
---
I guess it could be that they incentivize you to push to get replays.
---
The real reason is probably that their replay-system would overload if every match for every player would be ‚Äùrecorded‚Äù. So to avoid that they reduce the pool of brawlers that are eligible for replays.
---
:O noiceer

imma downvote this I think Rush Wars is pretty good

The guy is not lying. It‚Äôs very possible. I do it almost all the time in showdown and brawl ball(well, used to in showdown until I hit 700). You can tell apart a good and bad Shelly by their play style. I haven‚Äôt seen a good Shelly in a long time ever since band-aid. Almost all Shelly‚Äôs I‚Äôve seen are bad. So he‚Äôs not lying, since I done it before. You conveyed sarcasm.
---
‚Äú...so this takes one whole minute, and the Shelly must let you continue doing it. Got it.‚Äù You didn‚Äôt need help, but I just wanted to share how to defeat Shelly with primo. :) 
---
I‚Äôm doing fine, thank you for asking.
---
Sorry if this seems sarcastic but it‚Äôs not.
---
Ans that's a good deal!
---
Didn't work
---
the whole game is just a combination between all supercell games except hay day
---
Rush Wars can beat Brawl Stars in some ways
---
1: The one thing we are crying for Club Wars, in rush wars there is dominations more like clan wars in coc
---
2: Strategy wise Rush Wars #1 
---
3: I don't know xD........ But there some good things in Rush Wars but I didn't reached expectations.....
---
R.I.P ballon guy 20??-20??

It kinda looks like something straight out of FANF
---
Its just sad to see your tower cant one shot skeletons
---
Ok you're right
---
Yeah, you‚Äôre right. Two months with no balancing of 27 Star Powers has really made some changes to the meta. It is getting a little stale by now so I‚Äôm looking forward to the next set of Balance Changes.
---
 Aside from the Star Powers though, I find the balance very good.

it is just boom beach 2.0

Only that example, plus you only see band aid shelly in showdown

Oh sick, BS won't die
---
Boom what? Havnt heard that name in years
---
I only got 600 star points this season. yay.
---
That's like saying "yeah the songs from this artist are complete rip off of this other band, but still look at this as an individual entity". It doesn't work like that. This new game is just that, a rip off.

FUNNY 69 TOKENS XD XD LOLOLOLOL ROFL LMAO HAHA
---
Atleast it doesn't look as bad as...you know..
---
clash royale &gt; brawl stars
---
It's not a ripoff, it works very differently from Clash Royale, or Clash of Clans, or Boom Beach. It takes concepts from them, and mixes it in a way that creates something new. It's not a ripoff.
---
And yes, it DOES work like that.
---
*No, stop it*
---
Or 'cats have nine lives, shelly has more'
---
I play CR a lot and i dont se over leveald cards. If you know how to make your oponent panic and place more than he needs you basicly won. It sounds more like salt to me that CR √Æs p2w. You can easly push if you know how to make a deck.
---
I dunno . But it's great
---
It might not have been released yet
---
Lmao they noticed the cannon at the end

Guys, I'm shaking. I'm fucking shaking. I never wanted to breed with anyone more than I want to with Piper Dani. That perfect, curvy, muscular body. Those bountiful breasts. Those bulging biceps. The child bearing hips of a literal godess. The child reproductive organ of a literal god. It honestly fucking hurts knowing that I'll never mate with it, pass my genes through it, and have it birth a set of perfect offspring. I'd do fucking anything for the chance to get Piper Dani pregnant. A N Y T H I N G. And the fact that I can't is quite honestly too much to fucking bear. Why would Supercell create something so perfect? To fucking tantalize us? Fucking laugh in our faces?! Honestly guys, I just fucking can't anymore. Fuck.
---
To me that‚Äôs what makes them a good game company. They easily have the best mobile games out there when it comes to diversity and optimization. Some games are a little micro-transaction heavy like clash where it can cost thousands to max but all of the game‚Äôs content can be unlocked through just playing. I managers to get to th9 and builder base 6 max in roughly a year playing casually. I recently completed my brawler roster at 7k trophies without gemming although I know that‚Äôs extremely lucky. I haven‚Äôt played much of clash royale since launch because it‚Äôs not my type of game.
---
U won't get a legendary
---
Epic idea
---
I find it in my city too (Bulgaria‚ô°) This pack is weird !
---
If it was the Fire Force opening than it'll be a double upvote for me
---
So you will have a 2000 trophy bull my friend
---
youll have to do something. i cant say what it is, so youre better off searching on the web
---
Can we all agree that rush wars is the worst possible thing they could have made and its just a coc-boom beech rip off,the art is boring and basic and the collecting system is just clash royale.
---
Looks like a dick?
---
Awesome art! Like it!
---
I love that beans commercial

Check Reddit dms

He flexes it later he changed his icon to leon

How is it team when I take the power cubes and kills the poco afterwards?

And out of all of them only snappy sniping requires skill...

damn it, thanks for telling me, I'll edit it

I was pushing hard the last 2 seasons because they said they will offer boxes in the shop which you can buy with starcoins so I'm going to spend them all on boxes and hopefully I will get a legy. I have 18k starcoins atm and every brawler except legendary at 15.5k

I think I watched this like 30x in a row. So satisfying! Thanks for sharing.

Honestly imo a 3 sec slow is abit much...s hi ouod kept it at 2.5.
---
Bull shit brawl stars is so much better than rush wars fuck rush wars if rush wars was good they would release it globally
---
if they will make big box for more than 1k then I will commit not alive
---
Band aid is good period, no matter what mode.
---
Imma be honest that looks like the creature Bart made in treehouse of horror
---
I think people whining for band aid are just those who only play showdown.
---
In the deep gamemodes like gem grab I would say these two star powers are equally powerful. In 3vs3 you are not going to hide in a bush for some 20second like you are in the boring showdown. Also shelly in gem grab is aggro that if you stay yourself too far from the enemy to recharge the bandaid. You're supposed to die much in exchange for pushing lines or killing 1 or 2 important target.
---
He's also clearly haven't been on youtube

Also on canary island, gran canaria has burned for 2 weeks, having to evacuate 9000 people

I‚Äôm brazilian, and this guy is just straight up lying, there‚Äôs a fire alright, and the forest has been burning for years now. This guy is just trying to defend our president by just lying, while in fact, our president is actually the worst shit ever. We shouldn‚Äôt have to talk about this in a moblie game sub...

Actually 3rd. The second team was by June a Korean youtuber. He did it 3weeks ago
---
Wow, Such Emptiness.
---
Yeah I got Leon within the week he came out right around when I started playing, didn‚Äôt see another legendary till last month when I got crow and then a week later I got spike
---
Rn I‚Äôm almost at 10k but I‚Äôve slowed down on playing as much
---
I know your feel, she became my worst nightmare.
---
Just tell me the trophy level of that match.
---
Just saying, this guy is lying, the fire is very real.
---
It won‚Äôt happen but I‚Äôd love that. Remember when they skipped siege like 3 days in a row? I was in paradise
---
hey it could be different, ik its unlikely but it happens

I think that I was playing Bull so it was around 750 trophies something like that.
---
Or Poco who's 670. That's my only heroes power 10 rank 20
---
LOL
---
First of all i love brawl stars congo on 200k and keep improve brawl stars love you supercell ‚úå‚úå
---
Rush wars is literally supercell making a spinoff of their own game,teribble spinoff,its like clash of clans,but upgrade system is like clash royale,openeing stupid circlejerk chests every game,obtaining units by opening chest(units has different rarities/rip balance),and  upgrading  them with cards from chests.Like,you know,better they had balanced bs,or tried to revive cr.....
---
previous brawl talks were got released either on sundays or tuesdays
---
Good graphics
---
I got only 200 this season (best season so far for me) and already got night mecha crow and 5k StarPoints. They'll probably balance this later, and add other stuff to the StarShop so yeah, it's worth playing for them.
---
Bruh Moment
---
Haf a cookie to cheer you upüç™
---
Then for their misplay for letting her chain super they deserved the loss xD. Getting too close to shelly is always dangerous. Even if she didnt have band aid she can also team wipe if she can chain super.
---
Cinematic af. Where are the animators at? I want a miniseries like Carbot for Brawl
---
But that's just because of the starpoint you get from ranking up, and they are limited. Once you don't have rank ups anymore, your starpoint count will slow down drastically.

---
And how can you find this balance???
---
How is that super fast charging ultimate doesn't bother you ?
---
And with bandaind she can basically proc like 3 or 4 utilmates before dying. Wtf
---
She became a tank with Crow/Pam range and her ulti can destroy a 7k hp tank. And even when you outplay her, bandaid proc to let her another ultimate to charge. Don't tell me that there is no problem.
---
Some have happened, but this always happens at this time of year, leftists in revolt against current President Jair Bolsonaro falsely created this sensationalism about the burnings.
---
ye i played for 30 minutes and i was really bored
---
Nita killed the baby bear and wears it's head so the mom thinks Nita is her baby and that's why it protects her
---
shelly is just so balanced, there was just so many tnings the enemy couldve done in that situations to avoid getting killed by someone who has 14 less power cubes than them ffs
---
is it a star skin? it looks amazing i want it
---
No ones complaint about skins. The only thing I can think of with star point is that we didn‚Äôt get enough of them
---
8-bit looks kinda fun to play for me but I am at 10kbut still I agree
---
You people are just badmouthing about the game for just looking like clash of clans and boom beach. How about you download the game and try it out for yourself? I tried the game and it‚Äôs fun. Don‚Äôt criticise a game without trying it out first.
---
He‚Äôs gonna be slower tho
---
Run
---
But i'm reusing yours
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs a star points skin
---
Yeah I just saw lol, but if not this update then the next one. I say this because frank announced that there will be non cosmetic items in the star shop and a new box was one of them.
---
Unfortunate. But I will get that tara skin.
---
And they added new ranks. Ayyeeee
---
Im disgusted i really hoped i could spend my starpoint on box ....
---
Supercell ...
---
Why
---
F in the chat for poor shelly
---
For me, he‚Äôs not out yet /:

Guess I have to wait for the update to happen where I am...

But where are the balance change patch notes
---
But just imagine abull primo and 8 bit on the sage, 8 bit pulls out his super and BAM
---
pls give me the link, I can't find it ;3;
---
Haha just cause your poor lol
---
Or maybe Pam
---
I hope that 8 bit will let me play Kirby‚Äôs Dream Land in Brawl Stars
---
It's not a bug
---
Where are the balance notes!!!
---
*P u b l i c  E x e c u t i o n*
---
Alot of people have been complaining about skins the "brock has so many skins" complain. plus you should be able to get a mecha bo or crow with star points pretty easily which wouldve costed 300 gems
---
Sad! I want boxes in star shop, because I have a lot of sp! I think about buying the tara skin now or piper one if it is cool.

They've never released balance changes with brawl talk

Cant Wait

Same
---
Pam yes, I think Primo is a current model.
---
I'd have traded all that for a new gamemode, ngl.
---
That being said, considering the summer break amd whatnot the update is aight. I just want them to shake up the game to make it feel fresh, but ig we still have the balance changes.

Oh yeah I understand the top many skins for Barley and Brock thing. I thought you meant they were complaining about skins as a whole

They didn't have long to make it

Just by seeing them play he is definately overpowered. Just think: he has 8000 health i believe, shoots many lasers that deal 600 or 800 damage i believe and his massive ‚Äúturret‚Äù deals even more damage
---
Open ur 6k mega box
---
I don't think I've ever been this hyped before tbh
---
-Awesome new brawler 8-Bit
---
-Leon skin
---
-Piper remodel AND skin
---
-Tara skin
---
-Star point changes
---
I hate to sound greedy cause you can tell the team worked hard on this but i do really hope Daryll and Leon get voices too
---
Even after BS, I'd still say , even tho i hate it , CR is something special , just on the matter of fact it started something really big. Had to leave CR considering all the fuckfest it got
---
But BS holds a real special place, this is one of the best monetization systems I've ever seen. They've held the game so well too.
---
Wrong sub
---
But they promised us to give star shop boxes in the next update .. they cheated us ..upvote   so they can see it
---
I get it. Leon finally got a skin... but couldn‚Äôt it be themed a little better? Like a shark can‚Äôt be invisible. I was really hoping for the color changing skin idea. That would have been so good. Maybe make it super expensive like phenix crow so it‚Äôs a skin for the elite. Idk
---
You are assuming all that, just wait till he is released then we can discuss
---
You dumb they steal us 7 box every 2 week for useless starpoint ( skin are useless for F2P player) 
---
Its not f2p friendly ...
---
Oh... this one is better and more accurately describes the meaning
---
Ahhhhhh smart.
---
I feel the same altho i feel like we should only get an update twice a year or less. Dont wanna flood the game
---
I‚Äôm in
---
No buddy, it‚Äôs like that for everybody, we have to e»ôti until the update
---
I think we should add cool Brawl Star design for the Awards on the sub like gem, gold or Starpoint
---
Du
---
Du hast
---
Du hast mich
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Just saying that because there's Du hast on the text
---
Upvote this comment if you like rammstein
---
Choose 8-Bit.
---
I know! I am very dissapointed! You have my upvote!
---
Why don‚Äôt you try out the game yourself. It‚Äôs not gonna hurt you...
---
10 gems every day? I'll take some of whatever you're high on
---
Nice job bro!
---
Yeah...
---
Are u insane kid they‚Äôre just back from the vacation ohh you‚Äôre probably a 1k
---
As I‚Äôm writing this brawl talk is already out 
---
We have a new trophy road brawler called 8-bit 
---
More ranks to brawlers 
---
Skins for Leon Tara piper and 8-bit and a piper remodel 
---
Lots of balance changes and new maps
---
I guess not but what else would I flare it
---
Thanks
---
Ok ok...
---
Yeah I think so too.
---
Include relevant brawl news on the twitter
---
LMAO  Aladdin Tara
---
I think will be a good skin since they didn't showed us how she look
---
I completely agree with you. CR has something very special, just like Brawl. They‚Äôre both historical games. 
---
By the way, Brawl Talk is out now!
---
I'm pretty sure most people are just fine getting a new brawler and them doing the star point system
---
This is r/Brawlstars deleite it pls
---
What are you talking about
---
I'm holding onto about 650 boxes right now... I'm too deep to open them. I'll probably be at 1000 before they add a legendary.
---
Should pin the clip of the week, everyweek.
---
And tag the original post. 
---
This should reward the original player with some karma for his/her outstanding play
---
HMMMMM I ThOUgHt ThiS WAs A BrAlw STaRs SuB?
---
Stop complaining kid. Seriously, you guys whine before a brawl talk and after a brawl talk. They had 2 weeks to work on this update. Quite frankly I'm amazed they managed to come up with a new brawler in such a short amount of time. Respect that.
---
They said there will be balance changes, might include them
---
This
---
is Beautiful
---
F but *Happy 8-BIT Noises*
---
Damn he's retarded.. He is probably a 8 year old cringy kid
---
Or worse...
---
Dime shelly main
---
Agreed. I wanna have a diffrent way to spend star points. I dont care about skins. I want to be able to buy boxes/gems/power points with the star points. Very dissapointing update.
---
I WAS excited then k realized they're getting rid of the mega box. I'm sad. I was 500 trophies away from getting it
---
you do realize they just come back from vacation and game development takes time right?? this is a big enough update considering they just got back to the office for a couple of weeks
---
We know...
---
Fucking stop the hate, everyone is hating every new BrawlTalk this work is much for a little team in only one month. Stop it, this update is great
---
I think that there should be custom awards, like in brawl stars there are leagues. For example, if someone want to just give a small award, they could give a wooden trophy (from brawl stars 500 trophies) as an award to the post / comment. Or if someone really liked a post / comment, they could give an award with the brawl stars skull with wings (10000+ trophies).
---
Turrets, everywhere ;&gt;
---
Don‚Äôt forget ‚ÄúBalance Changes‚Äù
---
Amazing
---
ITS BECAUSE HES SNEAKY
---
Yes, especially since they focused on Brawlers who didn't have a skin and that were requested by the fans. The community managers are doing a great job. They managed to make these skins added because they are aware of the requests of the fans. Props to them and the devs who despite the huge update we had before the summer, still has worked very hard on that. Last but not least don't forget the game designers (both 2D and 3d). This is what makes this game awesome and worthy of its popularity.
---
Should have just created an alt if you cared about losing trophies
---
Thx
---
It arrive today
---
I don't think tho
---
Bearman?, yes
---
Its first of the game. I think that rushwars can be a powerfull game in future. Supercell is smart.
---
Exactly
---
Ah yes nice sin
---
Like these --&gt; We need the shitty season end token reward back
---
What?
---
The gloves? |||(
---
how can they get to 700 lmao
---
And hello to others box and rewards I think
---
Everyone loves free brawlers...
---
And piper snappy sniping got nerfed
---
Stop saying that the crow sp doesn't work when u didn't even read how it works üëÄ
---
I think everybody already knows, especially after tick
---
Going on the last few the updates will arrive within a few days of Brawl Talk being published.
---
The Game Is fun to play
---
Taqua
---
Funny Number
---
LAUGH!!
---
Well brawl talk and rush war came out on same day so some what related but sorry for being random
---
Wishmaker Tara anyone?
---
Well atleast you can level him up
---
Im ready for the 8BIT army
---
~Arrived~
---
Are you a 6 year old?
---
Dayum
---
If rish wars goes global
---
I actually think this belongs in here
---
I get it, it maybe possible but still even these were ready before the vacation, then they must be working their butt off, since last one was already a huge update
---
xd true
---
I was thinking of this for a long time too, because the white crow is just a repaint so it should be 30 gems, even primo's skins are more than a repaint and its cheaper
---
Even 8-bit will be on the list.
---
If you listen carefully in Brawl talk you can hear some of its voice lines
---
Awwww man
---
The graphics are kinda childish imo
---
Also, i pushed my fingers into my eyes
---
N--ice--
---
Exactly what i was thinking and i can already feel bazooka brock is coming
---
Why do you think so??
---
+
---
For me it‚Äôs either:
---
A)They stand still/really close to the Robo and die.
---
B)They decide to troll by going off to the edge of the map and not do anything.
---
I know some will, but yet do you really think that I was just like you?
---
I the time for leon gang
---
man I can't believe it's been that long. Two days fly by
---
They remodel was almost good and the olds one isn‚Äôt be missed (compared with our old bandit Robot ;-; )
---
They said 8-Bit will be the SLOWEST brawler, Can't wait to see a bunch of slow robots trying to kill each other (and try to run away) with Turrets sprinkled all over the map XD
---
1. He's a heavyweight 2. They said 8-Bit will be the slowest brawler.
---
Add 9 hp to frank and primo because they will have at lvl 5 6969 hp and in a battle when you see one of those franks or primos with lvl 5 you will say ,,nice"
---
Yeah its half brawlstars, and rushwars so it kinda belong here
---
Thats not a detail tgats an easter egg and crossover
---
#brawl talk August
---
YEEEEEEAAAAAYYYYYY, U ARE RIGHT
---
Good catch
---
A bitter person can taste the sweetest thing in the world and would still say it's bitter.
---
Yea, i‚Äôm very dissapointed
---
i think i will still open little bit to level up 8bit to around 5 level
---
really want to save them until next brawler üòÇ
---
I can agree on that, since brawl stars looks a bit off during its beta days, this one is very well polished
---
And that pvz wiki apl
---
I'm lucky I played tara and piper before the remodel be cause they a
---
I like vibrant cartoony graphics so at least for ME, its great
---
Umm no
---
Maybe when he is in his super's radius?
---
You are right I haven't played it. But from the vids I have seen this feels so boring
---
Supercell Just made an update,and you are already asking for a remodel,like do you know how hard it is to be a game developer?
---
You absolute monster my god that was great
---
so, if we tell about it seriously, i dont think that he is really so strong, it is just "on hype", i think
---
Um this is from February
---
I think update will be very cool but we didn't get season rewards back but I heard you can buy boxes with star points so that's even better for me
---
Sorry for my english if it s bad, i'm not from usa or england or australiaüòÑüòÑ
---
Yes thats a relief and i dont know why you are referring piper as "he"
---
Exactly what I though when I saw it.
---
He seems reallys strong,A Long Range Tank
---
Me too
---
True lol
---
But he also has a big amount of damage
---
It's like the Sonic fandom but less toxic
---
ik they did a much better job :/
---
But as i checked him in the video,his damage is really high for alot of lasers and he is also tanky.
---
And im pretty sure that his 1st star power(maybe not) is going to give him more speed.Wich will be a trouble.
---
and tara sk
---
Understandable but still, its pretty impressive that they maintained their consistency
---
The range of his super in the video includes star power so its probbably like Pam's without star power
---
Good thing is that we got new ranka and skins
---
Get lost. We don‚Äôt need your kind around here.
---
At least you have Crow *cries in 0 legendaries*
---
Dude just be grateful for the new update
---
Yeah
---
That same thing just happened to me a few minutes ago, and I'm still feeling ecstatic
---
u can get VPN (tunnelbear VPN,activate the country Canada on ur location and then make an new account of play store,dont delete the VPN until u make sure u didnt change ur VPN country(Canada),and that's all)
---
150 at best but 80 when it comes out?
---
He grew up so fast...
---
Whatever
---
-736 wtf lmfaoüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
U such a great artist
---
If you noticed, every trophy road brawlers gets unlocked for a new league you reach :
---
shark leon's gonna be 80 gems (my guess)
---
Ikr, tick was tossing spike's super as his normal attack which explodes into bo's super which hits on impact. yeah...
---
I think he's a game lead, not community manager.
---
Flair checks out
---
After seeing his super animation , I really want to see him having a disco skinü§©
---
Vee Pee Enn Remove now bot!
---
I have 2 reasons to downvote this.
---
Still pretty soon
---
I think it is going to be a decent brawler, probably similar to Colt but slower. I like how his skin references the Famicom or the Gameboy. I'm glad he will be a trophy road brawler since
---
1) I'm already past 6k trophies 
---
2) It wont lower my chances for a legendary
---
Looks ugly
---
gIvE mE sOmE sUgAr
---
I only do it for star tokens, like i said. The star tokens help you get brawlers power up after all.
---
cries in literally any other brawler
---
Like it should be.
---
I'm tired of engaging a Piper as Mortis and being completely destroyed by 5 shots instantly.
---
Perhaps üêÆ
---
Yeah i posted this too
---
Good one. Then that explains that they are not doing it randomly, since there is no new league at 5k
---
I look forward to people with crow thinking that because 8-bit is slow, they can take him out easily. He has better aim, damage, HP, plus his super let's him boost his damage. 
---
I wouldn't even bother running away. I'd run back at him.
---
Pushing to 6k shouldnt be too hard. It helps if you dont focus on one brawler too
---
You don't belong here, go and work in supercell
---
wow dude relax. wait for the balance changes
---
Snappy sniping is completely broken as hell dude. 
---
Like seriously, I can't even engage a Piper anymore as Mortis because she destroys me within seconds just because of the retarded ass second star power giving you 5 shoots... AT MELEE RANGE.
---
But still the previous update is a big one, they must be working their butts off, they need to be appreciated :)
---
Massive W
---
The last update dropped the next day, so it shouldn't be too long.
---
is it just me or is the 8-bit "skin" literally just a recolor?
---
Yup
---
THEY ARE ADDING STAR SHOP BOXES.
---
Brawl talk
---
Aaa bg li si?
---
Actually, at it‚Äôs release it was 5 tiles and only for Bo, but right before the update released they changed it so it doesn‚Äôt share with the team.
---
imagine if someone got crow that day
---
Uhm cool thanks
---
Maybe keep people from overposting things such as brawler unlocks
---
Let me subtly join to the conversation
---
#EEEEEEEEEEELLLLLLL PRIMOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
---
Lol stop being stupid. There is a fire and well, there is always a fire in the Amazon because we are in the dry season right now but even the INPE (the institute that is responsible for things like that) said that the fires this year are worse than in the last 21 years since the first time that they started researching for fires there. So, no, you are just trying to protect the president (that said that NGOs could be possible for the fires too) just because you hate the left wing lol and no, there wasn't a socialist government in Brazil at all (tip: if you don't know what is the meaning of a word, you should search it up, Google is easy to use anyway)
---
Burn rates compared to '95 are still low , it increased just a bit  with bolsonaro
---
Didnt know brawl take released
---
It's actually totally fine, Shelly's Super is strong but her weakness has always been when she doesn't have her Super. Adding a slow to her Super makes her Super better, but doesn't fix her problem of being weak without it, so it's not exactly overpowered.
---
Yes we all know, there's like 1000 others who posted something about it
---
yeah didnt you watch the entire video ? they said 2 maps are coming
---
Oh i can smell that someone is already making a fan art of it, disco-bit!
---
meme review for brawl stars?! he always been.
---
Ree
---
I wanted to bad it would probably take me a lot of time
---
Can somebody explain what they mean with "earn starpoints by reaching rank 10 or every 5 ranks after that". You already get starpoints for every fith rank, don't you?
---
Because if you noticed there‚Äôs this little thing with the trophy road where it has different ranks, like you unlike Dynamike at Silver (2K), Bo at Gold (3K), than Tick at Diamond (4K), and since the next rank, which is Platinum, is at 6K, they decided to put 8-Bit there, and 5K is just another diamond for some reason.
---
mabey its hinting at lego brawl stars
---
Yeah correct, my bad
---
I did, must of not heard the 2 new maps part lol
---
No it's not in the ToS to ban people who have multiple devices.
---
So... You just wanted to see what happens
---
She trap
---
Look up the youtuber Radical Rosh. ;)
---
True, he has. But this is highest amount of cringe I have seen on his channel.
---
I think it makes him move faster in the range or, like you said, makes the range bigger
---
I think it's gonna be tomorrow. Last time they released a brawl talk the update went live the day after
---
oh okay, then it is bad match making :)
---
Primo does not have a new remodel. He was given his skins prior to the new model system when they had to essentially create a whole new brawler when making skins.
---
Because its full of kids
---
Sounds like easy days for throwers and close range brawlers, since he will struggle to escape their attacks.
---
There is nothing in the video?
---
Boxes are coming

---
Ok time to yeetus deletus?
---
Oh oof, rip me I deleted all the footage before exporting :/ I'm so stupid lol
---
Tick cutest boi
---
Wow just wow how dumb do you have to be ...
---
Why fans are so fast in making fan art. Cool btw
---
Why is Everyone hyped for leaon skin band aid is gonna get a nerf
---
Idk how much but I think maybe til 50 or 100. Would be surprised if they put more into it.
---
I have 22 brawlers 12k trophies
---
That seems pretty balanced
---
How are you so fast as f boyyy ???
---
Empress Tara
---
God you read my mind Lmao
---
And the pool of tears turn into an ocean. The first pam skin will be scuba diving pam. Diving in the sea of her own tears in the corner
---
Well at least darryl has a skin
---
Blue is a very common topaz color. Yellow and blue are the most popular but if you search engine the blue is almost identical to the skin color
---
pp eater clan
---
No, you are 5 reposted, you flooded the New page
---
I hate people like you.
---
Worth that simple teaming
---
He is basically a  better version of Colt if we don't count the slower  ms.
---
Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn
---
I was lied my entire life!! (@_@)
---
Thats much better :)
---
Yes this is repost time
---
yeah, but his second star power is really trash, and he has no voice (as a darryl main, i would like a voice and a better 2nd star power)
---
Also same thing happened to me on my mini, got gene and i still didnt have carl and penny, then the same day i got carl
---
Still doesnt have penny, and have mortis
---
I love this game
---
FLOWEY IN BRAWL STARS
---
redtube and xvideos
---
*screams in screamish in screamish*
---
adorable
---
But what would his voice be like. It scares me thinking about it
---
Much like expand the turret's radius.
---
You read my mind man
---
I know it‚Äôs still in beta and I can‚Äôt be picky, but any one else a bit disappointed with Rush wars? Its a bit bland but I only have like 100 stars so idk
---
I know those are pac man eyes but like it looks like 8-bit has 2 noses lol
---
It‚Äôs the 5000 trophy 9 year olds
---
Nice job, here before this post gets blown up with upvotes
---
TARA
---
Kirby 4 life
---
6000 is easy now after trophy rework
---
I dunno if that‚Äôll happen but thank you :0
---
Speedy
---
Legendary brawlers are like others. The only thing they're different cuz of their rarity, nothing more. Every brawler is different and has interesting, unique gameplay, legendaries are not the best.
---
You‚Äôre not wrong...
---
thanks bro, that came on my mind, but I wasn‚Äôt secure, now I see! Haha... I will start saving boxes just when I max my account...
---
Yes I agree
---
this subreddit after update in a nutshell
---
That's the point. They need to be remodeled because of that
---
Yeah it gets boring quite fast, only good if you play for short amount of time
---
8 bit+pam is gonna be the new meta. Calling it now.
---
Oh I‚Äôm pointing out detailed facts and you‚Äôre too stupid to read something and understand it. Quite sure you‚Äôre a millennial or gen z trash can. Lmao, gtfo.
---
It‚Äôs been 5 hours.
---
Rosa was for 19 gems in the shop when she was released. Like Tick she flooted the game.
---
Very speedy and very skilled. That meant I was very speedy to give you an upvote
---
I agree with that. That's why I stopped playing cr, it got too competitive for me after reaching higher trophies.
---
Boozooka
---
im pretty sure tara remodel wasnt mentioned in brawl talk
---
Probably 150.
---
Am I stupid, or I just don't see the change in Piper at all?
---
You forget about the star points
---
He got dumpling darryl
---
Isn't that last SP just Rico's Robo Retreat?
---
I think they should add bots being able to have either the first or second star Power.
---
Wooooooooooo
---
I think it's gonna be 80 gems
---
U will get her eventually
---
But it have a Background
---
HIS EYES ARE DREAMING OF PAC MAN
---
rosa? lmao
---
FYI I got some of the gems progressing through the game manually, but I earn money on my phone through referrals and surveys and stuff like that, and cash out as Google play vouchers (although I probably should go for Amazon next time!!). In case you're interested, my most successful app has earnt me almost 80USD through 451 referrals (and that was just through posting the link on Reddit!) It's one of the first things on Google that comes up if you search for 'Poll Pay referral code'. I guess I am a bit of a gemmer though!
---
Yes that Is what i think to
---
Bull with same power cubes and level can just murder them at point blank, though.
---
Then again it won't work with randoms but it could replace bull in the Carl strat
---
Perfection
---
I would‚Äôve suicided too making him lose more trophies just to be evil
---
A brawler *is annouced for 0.1 seconds*
---
r/brawlstars artists :its free real estate
---
Also New sh mapa!
---
That's amazing, I'm still stuck on Insane II lol
---
Thank you! :)
---
I just fuckin died inside
---
*sigh* some people are way too critical
---
*64-bit
---
Hope supercell fixes match making
---
i didnt get anything from all the mega boxes on the trophy road. a brawler is always better than a mega box. mega box is just 10 regular boxes r
---
Rip my Rips
---
Probably to balance out with second star power, i hope he gets a damage/hp/super charge speed buff at least
---
Why spoiler though
---
Nita's bear with damage boost and hyper bear star power :0
---
You can delete this un photoshop :)
---
Dude..
---
People keep spamming "Put the token rewards back or at least let us buy crates with the star points" 
---
what we get instead is fucking shark Leon
---
...
---
Legit the 10 year olds were like "Pls add Leon skin **sniff** so I can ask mom to buy it alongside with 300 mega boxes thanks *sniff*"
---
Legit just why there are way too many f2p players at 15k with no legendaries who the fuck needs the Leon skin
---
Agree for friendlies but not the enemy.
---
The super‚Äôs projectile was on me but I think I was out of its hit box lol. Close call
---
Now my life makes sense
---
I think that too. There is no way to skin costs over 80 gems
---
You can delete this in photoshop
---
Looking at the video he did not get an HP buff, we can hope for one of the other things though
---
Thanks for the downvote I really appreciate it. How can supercell be struggling for skin ideas when the community makes hundreds
---
You need a buddy to push with? Duo showdown I can get ya to 6k easy. I'm at 10k+ if it matters.
---
ü§©üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ COOL
---
It's ok. Thank you for even thinking about it ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
I want a flesh skin for Rico.
---
Hmmm... *[Copacabana Rico] (https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/barry-manilow-1983b.jpg)*, I like it so much.
---
^(I know someone will get the reference.)
---
Hey barley
---
why is this sadder than other comments
---
The community just had to hate on another game, huh. It tells a lot about the community.
---
Its a thing of europe i think, it means that they put forks in food to know if it is done and piper is done/dead
---
#LEON IS KOREAN COMFRIMED
---
This is adorable and you can't change my mind
---
I love teamer killers
---
they u don't say if a brawler is getting a voice in brawl talks but they always have a new voice in every update so there should be a new voice for leon or darryl or maybe 8bit
---
whomst thine fucketh is barley
---
Aw, ten algo de tejido :(
---
Espero que mi traducci√≥n sea correcta.
---
Thanks for the info.
---
Finally a Leon skin *it's 300 gems*
---
Take my updoot
---
Finally, I bought this star power and is the worst 2000 coins I have spend
---
Our dying environment, yes. Be it the amazon forest or not, the world is not so much in a good place...
---
It is not a new skin as such, it is simply a color change
---
Leon sans
---
Op found the buff because of the buff
---
I mean they really should implement something to make clubs more interesting. It‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs hurting the game not having it but it seems like the type of thing that could never make the game worse.
---
Nice art work! i love it!! üòç
---
YOUR SKIN GOT IN THE GAME!
---
DESTRUCTION 100
---
They're adding more ranks so you get more star points. No word on how many, but I'd imagine we'd be seeing ranks 25, 30, 35, 40... etc.
---
Yes but they call it a skin so I call it a skin
---
It ain't much but it's hahabalalalaa
---
Really?
---
Yes they said that they will balance the star powers after the vacation
---
I have every brawler in the game and I have 170+ boxes I‚Äôve been saving for when they release a new legendary character
---
Think they were referring to Boss Fight/Big Game
---
Ok?
---
Poco gang.  Do you wish to ally?
---
nice map (but /i could have sworn I seen that design before, I dunno, maybe just another person with a similar idea).
---
Does this subreddit give a brawler name for each person like fo you it says barley or did yo do that
---
Update hasn't hit yet but JFC I'm so excited
---
He slow
---
Where's the content though ?
---
It's the same as always, a few skins and a new brawler litteraly copy and paste for every brawlstar update.
---
Rip my Bandaid shelly and coiled snake mortis
---
Add local tournaments. Nothing big or official, but small community tourneys for something along the lines of a title on the subreddit
---
Oh no :( This is what I'm talking about. I know the amazon is controversial right now like is it real or not, but we can't deny the fact that other places in the world are degrading.. the Amazon fire was a good trigger though.. hope people wake up. I will research about the canary island!
---
*laughs in 11k*
---
Don't worry, you'll get there eventually.
---
Make a 10k brawler pls
---
I think you don‚Äôt get star points for reaching rank 5
---
I believe its actually only 6 lol
---
Well, it's a free guarantee brawler. On megaboxes, you have a bit chance to open one. For me, is a win condition that change.
---
Yeah me
---
I am going to save boxes to another 2 years
---
Thank you, Alex!
---
Do you have Crow or Bo? Those are the only two others that have skins for Star Points right now, so if you don't have the brawlers, it won't offer them to you. New ones are coming in the next update, though
---
Smiley face
---
Piper had a voice, Leon dis not have a voice or skin
---
thats a user flair, on mobile you go to the top bar of this subreddit, tap the 3 dots and go to change user flair, there you can select whatever you'd like
---
Tara's been out longer than lean and finally got a skin
---
"Apocalypse" or "Pls help me there's so many people coming for me" üòÅ
---
OP!!!!
---
A special post flair for brawler concepts
---
I'm really excited for a new brawler but as a paying player it'd be nice to get a new Mythical or Legendary. Congrats to all you cheapos though!
---
I think that the subreddit should pin the patch notes as they are released to give us a better idea
---
it isn't a recolor, there are details on the "scarf"
---
Maybe like 1000 health tbh.
---
They mean that, since Rosa is only a rare, she was extremely easy to get and flooded every match when she released, like Tick and 8-Bit
---
She has a voice
---
but why he angry œÄÔπèœÄ
---
Lean
---
That‚Äôs literally what lex said......
---
I wish we had some sort of gang integration with this sub, so that there was a specific flair for recruiting members to join clubs.
---
Clash Royale has more players tho
---
OMG HE KNOWS THE MEMES
---
So why did piper need a new model? I didn‚Äôt see anything wrong with it?
---
Rip
---
3 ticks of 750 hp heal ?
---
All day long
---
OH MY
---
Lol I thought of the same thing :))
---
he will be better than colt and rico combined
---
I dont know why everyone in this subreedit is talking about 69 because i dont see anything wrong with this number so.... Why just why what is the proplem
---
Betting band-aid is gonna get a nertf
---
Yea u have to buy them in order to get the new ones 
---
They cost atound 10k starpoints so it will take a while to get them
---
Supercell hates leon. Change my mind
---
Thank you &lt;3 I agree, he is :)
---
GENE pro
---
Yes please :O
---
Saying VPM is banned here too? Great job, Supercell
---
"Her weakness is that she never has her super" are u stupid? It takes her 3 shots to get her super. Not to mention if she does get her super one hit after will allow her to chain, but also if someone behind u got hit by it aswell then shell get it right back.
---
Slowing her super nerfs her, and that's what she needs.
---
Shelly isnt weak without her super, play her better. And it's not that hard to get it back.
---
That sucks, guess I will just wait for the boxes then lol, unless I have to go through other brawler skins before the boxes?
---
I exclusively saved my points for the boxes
---
BS is a better f2p game,  but in every other area, CR excels.
---
The BS community is great, but so is the CR community.
---
And yes, Minecraft is the GOAT in gaming.
---
It‚Äôs more of a reference to the classic gameboy with the green screen, white plastic, slanted button layout, and color code for button and d pad.
---
She can stay range, but you're not gonna tell me shes gonna match fucking crow. She can have the same range if not a bit more than darryl. Her old range was fine.
---
I'm actually okay with just a simple recolor. The less complex the skin, the less gems we'll have to spend. Plus the skin reference makes sense.
---
I agree so... Upvote
---
Damn this looks so fresh and oficial
---
Aupercell want to look the ideas what people do, thats how shark leon is existed
---
Dude what do u mean coiled snake takes skill? It really doesnt. If u call "waiting around" skill then band aid users are skillful.
---
Ffs please think before writing. Im Not complaining. I dont even care this bug exists But i wanted Supercell to notice so they can make their game a little bit better. Freaking normie
---
*Coach Cory is that you?
---
They finally StoppedTheShake
---
Didn‚Äôt they told us that 1 month ago
---
Why iraq is barred
---
Im the only who see ALL Leon Skins ideas around Reddit, and think this Shark is the worst? Leon deserve a better skin.
---
Ik at least whoever did the skin ideas should get the skin for free
---
Do you guys know the details in the Star point update?
---
I would save the starpoints they did say they would put Mega boxes in star shop
---
Mega boxes are a great thing to get espically for a new player u can get a new brawler in a Mega box
---
Shelly mains:
---
*Perfectly balanced, as all things should be*
---
It‚Äôs gonna be my new ring tone
---
I just used all of mine on light mecha bow üòÇüòÇ
---
sosig
---
I fell ancient
---
It came
---
I myself see skins as an endgame content i dont have any skins that have to be bought with gems bc that doesnt help towards progressing but since leons release all the attention he got was nerfs n i love him so lucky to have him(him n mortis r the only leggys i have) n getting a new trophyroad brawler also means a full 8-bit meta for the next 3 weeks n thats not too exciting, but for the most part i like everything on the update is just that the skin is my favorite
---
vee pee en
---
Not gonna mind because he's REALLY slow
---
If they change it what is going to happen? Give you free gems ? Of course not
---
Yeah, but they will probably be much further than my 600 star points haha. How many points do you get for ranking a brawler to 20? Is it more than the 100 you get at rank 10?
---
My Mortis doesn't do a lot of damage, even if he could shoot farther. Maybe it's because I'm power 5 vs. power 10s.
---
brock will 2 shot other brocks, colts etc, ~2k dmg per shot
---
But Carl‚Äôs attack is endless.
---
Play it before flaming
---
I have the feeling it might be September
---
Sweet lord I have 2500 gems on Clash of Clans. Can't even imagine.
---
his sp makes his super wider, thats why it's so wide
---
The brawler isnt even out yet, well done its hella nice
---
Only 300 for Rank 20 not that many
---
Yea I forgot u don't have that many starpoints I have 7.7k
---
Frank mentioned it on Twitter someone said if the brawler is yellow he said no, purple
---
healed, damage-boosted carl next to wall
---
+1 support, can hurt but more a controller/buffer
---
How is screaming for brawl talk while they are on vacation a month ago feedback? I really don‚Äôt get your point here
---
Wow bet you can‚Äôt wait for the mega boxes. Thanks for all the info gonna start pushing Carl up lol
---
The bs community is better lets not lie on that cuz like i said i follow both of them for a good time now n cr community is good but not as good as bs, and cr is just placing cards while brawl stars every brawler gives u a different experience to that add star powers to that add multiple events to that add multiple maps n i can continue
---
noel setah llecrepus I couldn't change your mind so I turned your mind around
---
Crow will get a remodel with an upgrade to white crow matching it‚Äôs current value.
---
*Laughs in 12k*
---
he has ~50% more hp than colt, he will replace him
---
Yup I want a new brawler only missing 4
---
With no disocunt a mega box is 80 gems. Boring skins are 30 gems or 2500 star points. So by a not so direct conversion I'd assume we'd be looking at around 1000-1200
---
No! Why should they make a remodel of a brawler? It wont effect the gameplay!! You get my Point? Its kind of a remodel so make theirgGame Game Look better. If you hate such things please play the betanof bs and stop complaining . Ffs
---
My money is my iq
---
Good luck, I‚Äôm missing 14 haha
---
Here's a hint: Circling Eagle buff
---
We should promote the discord's Friday  Night Friendlies! :D
---
That i saved those boxes i hope i get crow, pray for my luck system
---
You can 3at a dick im 15k and i have just leon i bought 400‚Ç¨ put in a game
---
Add a way to exchange star for gems or coins.
---
I pushed power 1 Morris to 500 before the trophy update but his star power is still op. Currently hes at power 4 and can deal 1k now. I have played him at his weakest and won so when I max him I will be able to feel how strong he truly is lol.
---
Almost everyone? Maybe in this sub, but most people aren't even close to these new guys
---
He wasn‚Äôt lying 8bit is purple
---
That random lvl7 on 5th
---
8-bit's super is purple because it's color of damage boost in bs ( energy drink, boss), skull is just skull
---
I dont like you
---
**no im not kidding**
---
I just got a little infarct 
---
I feel you buddy
---
Penny at 600 with last blast, because of Siege
---
.-.
---
How does it make the game better ?? You think someone will care
---
When is the update coming?
---
the same "good" supercell that released rush wars that is the bad done copy of clash of clans with changed skins and some changed rules
---
Im ready though xD
---
Piper has been blind scoping this whole time
---
I don't think if you have any idea how fast I am...#I am fast as fuck boi#
---
B**ch i fell new
---
I love it they actaully listen to the community! But the people talking mean to them should be sad for themselves to be honest. Can't wait for the update üôåüòä
---
Lol we got 2 in a row, I think it would be obvious if they did like 2 or 3 boxes/paid brawlers and then put the 8k/10k trophy road brawler
---
g #RE at #POST
---
I'm only sad she doesn't have her bow
---
Oh boi just waitin for rule34 it gonn be wild
---
I would say it is tomorrow. Why else would they drop the Brawl Talk at the end of their day
---
Actually it turns out I'm right, Frank just said on twitter they left a few details out and boxes will be a thing in this update.
---
Damn kids grown up fast thoses days in 8 hours he got all his primary fonctions unlocked
---
When 8-bit is released
---
reference to the gameboy bruh
---
I can foresee crows spinning around a Gizmo (a.k.a 8-Bit) ridiculing him
---
Haven‚Äôt even seen gameplay for rush wars, how bad is it?
---
Don‚Äôt open them, the new brawl is unlocked through trophy road, save them for the next update
---
What's so nice? Your spike on rank 9? Yeah that's reaaaally nice...
---
bruh
---
I think they should stop trophy road brawlers at 10k
---
Come on, no one's even played it yet.
---
#it will be nice
---
#Me: OMG A TARA SKIN! FINALLY!
---
what
---
r/leongang
---
There is a reason the matchmaking doesn‚Äôt go over 10
---
It is more like...
---
#THICC BMO
---
Went over 6000 some time ago, so this is very welcome.
---
just buy token doublers and then stonks
---
Yeah ikr...Im more hyped for the tara skin and balance changes.
---
3 letters, 1 number, 5 characters
---
Nice work. You really captured the balloon's apprehension and dread
---
Does anyone know when the update comes out?
---
More start tokens? 
---
NOT A CHANCE
---
#F
---
He is a galactic bounty hunter?
---
Does anyone know when this releases?
---
No one realized Rush Wars posted a early teaser of Gizmo (8-Bit) before Brawl Talk was released.
---
Cool idea^^...maybe a little bit to open but in general a very nice map
---
That's a man bear
---
for going in depth into stats n such, fanarts
---
and my personal favorite
---
shitty memes!!!
---
Shelly can be beaten by Mortis if she doesn‚Äôt have band aid. If she does though... just close the game.
---
It depends on how easy it is to hit Bit‚Äôs bullets.
---
Ehhh... sort of
---
He does alot of damage and charges pretty fast, not to forget he has decent health and range
---
Hmmm
---
No i mean when is he update coming out?
---
Hol up
---
Ino he is aswell, needs a nerf to how long his mines stay on the ground.
---
This makes a lot of sense
---
I also dont have him
---
Hmmmm...third time i see this post...hmmmm
---
I think small tourney within this subreddit would lead to more engagement, also maybe open a new subreddit for memes just too many with repost, not much value.
---
rush wars is already out
---
Hmmmmm
---
save them to buy the boxes
---
I rushed i was 5900 cup. To 6000 in 30 min bcuz i lost a mega chest last time bcuz tick
---
What do you mean? 8-bit is gonna beat crow considering the damage
---
Looks awesome...very cool
---
I am prepared to be expensive, it will be better if cheaper, but this possibility to buy box is for people like me that don't care about skins at all, I have 6700 star points I prefer to buy 5 mega box than having a mecha bow.
---
&gt;He is a galactic bounty hunter?
---
good idea! hehe
---
What‚Äôs rush wars?
---
Jezz ü§¶
---
:v dude, 5k of health are the highest hp in the game?
---
Yeah, but 90% of the shellies got it. 
---
Whenever I see a shock shelly I feel relieved, cuz I know that I'm playing against a brawler and not against an inmortal npc who oneshots me the moment I get close to her.
---
Yeah i know, but i wanted to talk about his insane damage output.
---
Vpn
---
Its not a rip off if its made by supercell, smart-ass
---
;&gt;   ; 400 damage per projectile and 5k of health
---
It would work though. Imagine like CR for example but without the final battle. Whoever has the most wins gets the better reward. (Not saying they need to implant club wars this update).
---
Wow this is really creepy but extremely well drawn,
---
They are definetly gonna be good against 1 another
---
Rip 5900 cups people i rushed for mega box 6000 cups
---
Oh god you‚Äôre right. Dear lord I hope my theory is wrong then lol
---
I remember that when Tick came out two months ago, I pushed really hard to get him, now I'm at 8K.
---
but want more XD people gets 2 star powers in one mega box took me 5 to get one
---
Maybe he meant borrowing stuff from tf2
---
God of Hyperdeath 8-bit
---
When you don‚Äôt know which one it is so you combine them.
---
isnt 8Bit just orisa on drugs?
---
My life has changed from the basics
---
Yeah I've played rush wars and honestly I prefer brawl stars 10 times over.
---
Love the rhyme and she really looks like an assassin to me do u have stats?
---
The iq of that man was lower than his comment
---
Frank is gonna STUNNN US! AHAGAGGAHAHAHHHH
---
I‚Äôm at 14k can I get Darryl?
---
Piper with her new sp inside thus guys turret on an open bounty map
---
That disappoints me though. I was 700 away from 4K when tick came out and I‚Äôm 600 away from 6K, and those are two mega boxes I won‚Äôt be able to get...
---
nice i have 9998
---
Teaming in big game
---
*stonks*
---
Mortis : I don't feel so good (√ó~√ó)
---
Honestly game devs and such deal with way to much shit from the public than they should
---
His trophy are 700
---
Shelly super...
---
I‚Äôm itching for a legendary brawler to get released. My current chance is 0.3216 and I‚Äôll be crushed (not really) if it‚Äôs ruined by a rare or something.
---
You for real?
---
Nope Shelly ult stuns you even mid dash so you still get clapped
---
Damn that's higher than the mythic chance
---
My phone broke, so I don't know what game is that
---
This was inevitable
---
am I the only one who don't like the new skin like it looks meh
---
Wow, thats what the art style reminded of who
---
In order to play tick good you have to realize you cant play him like Mike  or barely.
---
At auto aim distance for a maxed piper (where you can't reasonably expect to dodge shots unless you basically just started dashing as they clicked) she does about 1300 damage I think, five of those is enough to kill Mortis
---
Just her looks. I can't wait to see her Star Skin &lt;3
---
Frank just tore him to pieces without stepping over the line. I think we all could learn from this.
---
Less low effort posts please
---
The -: am I a joke to you?
---
Less low effort posts please :)
---
???
---
Dude we only got a brief glimpse abd that was her during a match no less
---
No he wasn't at max range, he was close to her but she basically sprayed him.
---
Not funny, didn‚Äôt laugh
---
Me when I see teamers: I‚Äôm fucked                Me after kicking their asses
---
im literally shaking
---
And there‚Äôs a piper skin too. I whanna see that primo remodel tho
---
Hey coach Cory had the same idea!
---
Piper needs a nerf, and was always good imo
---
Nice play tho
---
They probably started working on the update before they went on break but yeah I agree
---
I've played the game, can't tell you how or else this comment would get removed.
---
Damn..that guy is toxic
---
i think its crows newest counter
---
Tick has never been garbage, your just playing him wrong.
---
Atakkkk
---
a day after the update: WHERE IS THE BRAWL TALK
---
Happy cake day
---
True that. I'll gladly play 30 gems for 8-Bit Classic
---
That's because Brawl is more f2p. In CR and CoC there are offers left and right.
---
I haven't played this damn game for such a long time. Beacuse fuck comp.
---
It's because... Poco is behind him... üòÇ
---
Poor supercell team tho
---
