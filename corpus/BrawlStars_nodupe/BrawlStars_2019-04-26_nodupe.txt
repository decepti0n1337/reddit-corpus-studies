Whenever I try to play Piper in Heist I somehow get left trying to defend the safe by myself, every time. I normally can't handle it :(
---

---
The one or two times I can actually get to the enemy safe I feel like I can slam it pretty hard.

Do you have any tips? While corner case is still around...

You threw the game in order to get "revenge," not only is it not revenge as they had lost the first match, they were just playing the game how it's meant to be played. Your justification for throwing the match was childish

\*saves 60 boxes for a rare brawler\*

ok

Piper in a Destroyed far future...

Shut the fuck up noob

Really? I love brawlstars. How has clash Royale changed so much? Can you explain specifically things you don't like?
---
I suggest you should sit down, take a break for a few hours, then come back.
---
You're welcome! Keep up the great art!
---
i dont think its bs that every single goddamn gedi-kor skin has to be pumped into their game. they have theri own ideas too
---
Do we know her star power?
---
good bot
---
I mean regular mortis (top hat) is great but I can't stand NOT seeing the in-game night witch effects now
---
U agree in-game effects are awesome right?
---
are you retarded
---
When a brawler comes out it's always discounted in the shop, and a discounted rare is 19 gems XD
---
Kinda reminds me of Rick Grimes from The Walking Dead.
---
Anyone else?

kkkkk ala os falantes de portugues fazendo bom conte√∫do pra comunidade

No like, how many gems *he* has.

Fr?
---
I love Brawl Stars as well, but as with much of the community, we would like a definitive answer to teaming in solo showdown. Not these same 4 or 5 viral clips of mushrooms, we need to fix that.
---
As with Clash Royale, the trophy road is a good idea, but having joined back in after 2 or 3 updates I dont understand why we need all the UI changes.

Yep, both games also take strategy.

---
I didn't received the update.
---
I mean: seems like people didn't get it was a joke
---
Which is why we need recommendations to make them interesting.
---
I used to play a game from Boombit, called TanksALot, that I really liked. Downloaded Brawl Stars to find out that it‚Äôs a mirrored game, except with brawlers and not tanks. Same game modes and such. Turns out getting into Brawl Stars was just as easy.
---
But this would be a great map for us Barleys
---
How?
---
Something that gets HARD.
---
Oh I thought you meant actual bots
---
Omg I did that too but my crow was yellow, circular, and I got 19 of them!
---
First of all, yeah I just said you can analyze a brawler before they‚Äôre out and you can have an opinion.
---
Second of all, you can also do that with any other tank. But if the other brawler dies in the middle, Rosa might not even get her super. It‚Äôs a good strategy but one good strategy doesn‚Äôt make a brawler op.
---
I got ideas like:
---
-Wars. 
---
-Maybe some sort of power donations to justify the rationale behind clubs. 
---
-Club chest-esque weekly event like the one we used to have in Royale.
---
If my investigations are not wrong, Leon has Ebulla in lower amounts in his super, the main reason he can become invisible in the battlefield.  If they are wrong, then what is that?
---
Also, one of the ways to avoid Ebulla is to check footsteps, which are left by nearly every brawler while walking (shoutout to Carl for helping me with this one).
---
amazing skin you're such a talented artist
---
Ok, but you can analyze a brawler and assume they will need a buff or a nerf.
---
Thanks for watching video~^^!!
---
\*lightspeed upvote\*
---
Exactly but guess what they just ignore these posts
---
You have 19 gems so you‚Äôre good

Let's just hope that Darius doesn't steal this

Was aiming for just the color scheme of Luigi while also making it look like me.

Ridiculing and insulting someone over reposting GEDI-KOR‚Äôs artwork for fake internet points just shows how childish this subreddit is

Star power is the only problem I have because physically touching another brawler isn't really useful the poison in bush could be okay or possible star power life leech Kim heals 25% of damage given so 300 damage would be 75 HP healed

Holy..
---
Dang how many trophies are you at?

He probably just made a new account tbh

Nah I want it to say play again without these clowns

Free brawlers at only 1600? No maybe if it was like 10000 it would be better

*wow, that sucks*

I think the problem is that people play a match, see it's all the same character and post it for easy karma even if they are never on this sub.
---
Everything, dude. All you said is bullshit and makes no sense
---
In Brawl Ball she is insane, if you can ult 2 enemies which is not too hard = free extra ult to pull again, if 3 enemies - all dead no matter what.
---
This is brilliant

I would do it too if it was something more enjoyable.

ok i hope this is the joke

Yeah especially since its like an obviously a PG game. Some people suck :/

Not this whole thing again

Maybe he attacked with his tongue? Every time he hops he does an AOE attack with his tongue. That be pretty neat.

Haha, I think the average player usually get around that much. I play maybe an hour a day so I can only grind so much.

The guys who grind 100+ are legends

When I was ur age (with trophies), I hat nothin' on my account too no Mythic or Legends, but about 5k I got Mortis, then about 6k get Crow and I dunno when, but get Tara, so just wait my friend, cuz' SUPERCELL systems works that only noobs gettin' every brawler at start, but pros gets nothin'

And 5 big boxes

But I don't have any legendariesü§¶
---
Piper and Rico combination is bad. This mode is about conquering the middle. Nita won‚Äôt be staying mid, so this composition is very weak against dive composition. This map highly favors aggro, which makes both Rico and Piper easily to get jumped on by enemy tanks. Even if no one die. You are going to lose dominance over middle because of how squishy the team members are.
---
I like Brock over Piper, because of his super, and he has relatively lower difficulty to play
---
I don‚Äôt agree with having Rico in the team at all. The map favors aggro due to the amount of cover it has. The covers are also not lined up like pinballs for Rico to shoot at. I would suggest replacing with Gene or Poco who can scout enemy bushes better due to their wide range.
---
So my best team composition would be Leon/Nita, Poco/Gene and Brock
---
Congrats!!

....oh fuck that can only mean Rosa...... is worse :(

it's not an outplay, just a dumb primo. he should have straight up ignored the dynamike and ran to the enemies safe instead. destroying it with his team 2v3.
---
primo had no chance of catching the dynamike, not even if he kept trying to reach him for another 3 minutes, so why even waste your time trying to defend something that you cant defend alone
---

No one cares

r /notawoooosh
---
Wow
---
Yeah it was the first mode after I got her that I played cause of the star token.
---
Both games I faced 3 rosas.. Does that mean I know how she reacts against long range brawlers? No. 
---
Does that means I know how good or bad is she against shelly primo or other tanks? No.
---
Does that mean every map will always be full of rosas forever? No.
---
Cant see your point here
---
Mt. Dew it.
---
yeh, *furiously aims super at poco lock*
---
At least pam was more manageable than this lol

Yep. Not all brawlers are suited for SD. Some are better on other events like bounty or siege. I can‚Äôt help you on that buddy.

Mom give me tge credit card

We dont care
---
Hmmmmmmm
---
Footbull should be in common

I opened 58 boxes, didn't got her.....
---
well,i saved up boxes, got gems from the boxes, used them to buy rosa and used the rest of the boxes for upgrading rosa
---
Pepe the meme lord frog
---
Not following you here chief. When a champ can walk through a team and not even lose 2k health in a game mode where you only need to walk to the other side of the map. The whole team has to focus one character
---
How will he leave when she has ult? Only by using his ult to escape, cuz their speed is the same.
---
19 gems is not much for a new brawler. I mean you could spend 50 for token doublers and still wont be sure if you will get her..
---
Plus buying her wont affect your chances for a legendary
---
cooool!
---
Like I‚Äôm not even on the bandwagon of her being broken. I‚Äôm saying in brawl ball is actually not fair.
---
**STOP PUTTING NETA ANYWHERE NEAR BEAR ASS/CORCH FFS, SMH!!!**

Will say buy it cuz u had to buy it as well üò≠
---
For real dog hahah. Blows my mind

am i the only one who noticed the green gas dynamike is falling into to?

for now i can only except desperated kids under 5k trophies talking here.. saying non sense things etc..... let them talk...

It‚Äôs an elevator to the 7th circle

It‚Äôs removed u know
---
Haha if it makes you feel any better, leon SUCKS at siege XD his invis is pretty much useless lol
---
Well many times Ive seen a frank just walking in the goal without dying and he doesnt even need super or anything.. 
---
All Im saying is her super wont last forever, and she wont have the same advantage against long range brawlers even in brawl ball..
---
But how exactly do you compare her to Darryl? What in the world does Darryl have to do with her?
---
Lol thank u for tellin
---
Shes easy to pack just play
---
You *clap clap* are wrong *clap* Top hat mortis *clap clap* is the og * clap* no hat mortis *clap clap* is the skin
---
i think he only should do half circles similar to Poco's attack
---
so true!
---
Also guys,a Rosa with 7 powercubes do 183 of damage in another Rosa with shield :0

I still don't get why Colt's bullets have faces as if they were Banzai Bills

pretty nope

Not when she is literally walking into the goal with the ball

I don't know man when i will get her but i am happy that i have 24 brawlers now

I know... but if I buy it now, I have unlucked it
---
Cuz maybe I dont wanna wait
---
Lol

Sorry(((

Si questo √® vero ma sarebbe pi√π rapido in questo modoüòå
---
If she is big brawler?

I'm pretty sure this is an English only sub, although it is not stated in the rules
---
Something like croak sounds about right
---
If it pleases you guys i started from global and just got spike like 2 weeks ago, no mythics and no other legendaries
---
I would prefer to see her without her super suit when looking at brawlers
---
We should give her slowness when she has her super on, since its quite broken

Nice
---
##it was all part of the plan
---
I have all these skins.
---
That's why I uninstalled Clash, read more than three title
---
As a crow main, I don‚Äôt appreciate spending half the match slowly whittling away a Rosa just for her to get Poco‚Äôd and reverse all my hard work.
---
Also, doesn‚Äôt her Star Power make Crow unable to kill her? She just has too much health and heals in bushes faster than poison
---
Then why are you even posting this??? There's absolutely no reason to buy this other than wasting gold that could be used to get a brawler from 7 to 9, for something that you will get from boxes in some days. I can't even believe how fucking dumb people on this sub are.
---
Idk
---
The chances of getting a new brawler are high saving boxes?? I'm 7,5k and I never tried to save boxes
---
What I wanna know is how they lost
---
its hip to kill bees (look at profile name)
---
it was 19 gems in the store for me - I had all other Rare bralwers so it was Rosa guaranteed
---
RATING PEGI 12
---
Supercell should fix that
---
Remember when you first started the game and El Primo seemed INVINCIBLE in Cavern churn? Well we are all experiencing that with Rosa again. Eventually, people will start hard countering with Shelly, and the meta will balance. As people get used to her, matches won‚Äôt always have a Rosa in them, and brawlers that get Hard countered (Crow, Nita, Primo) will have a chance again.
---
I think u mean *literally any brawler*
---
True
---
I went 41 brawl boxes and 1 big box
---
ü§£ü§£
---
dude i saved like 5 big boxes and got her in 4 of them
---
Yeah you are quite lucky...on my mini account I am at 3500 trophies and only one epic no mythics no legendaries...

Thanks for the not positive criticism

I dont ever see them...I just see black crows...

---
Am I the only one that did not want Rosa in the game as soon as she was teased, I mean as soon as I read she was going to be a heavyweight along with a super that shields her and then a star power that heals while in a bush? It just sounded like it was going to be broken immediately.
---
WHO CARES!? IF YOU STOP TO EXPLAIN, YOU'RE A GONNER!
---
I thought I will never quit playing this game but Rosa is my cure. This is messed up big time. Thanks SC, I needed this to OP my super-addiction to this game!!!

She is like shelly useless without her super so don't nerf rosa super just nerf the hits needed to recharge super from 3 to 5 or 6

She needs to nerf her super from 80% defence to 50 or 40%.

Me too lol. i post 2 of Rosa on here check it out on my page.
---
And thus a new meme was born!
---
same! i had 4 big boxes too!
---
She literally chains her super
---
Dare I say I despise it.
---
**Horrible Histories has joined the chat.**
---
No time to explain!
---
Or gems, reward high level players.
---
I would even prefer an icon over 300 (I‚Äôm maxed out)
---
He could also be also a completely new brawler since he doesn't really resembles El Primo
---
Few suggestions on a solid NERF for Rosa.
---
1) Her super is far too powerful, and is nearly impossible to kill with any brawler. She is extremely overwhelming in modes such as brawl ball, siege, and gem grab, where all she has to do is use her super and acquire the item. I suggest you reduce the damage she absorbs to 50% rather than the current 80. This will ensure that she is killable, but still making her a unique strength in certain game modes.
---
2) Continuing with her super, she shouldn‚Äôt be able to gain super charge while she is using her super, because while she‚Äôs shielded, she attacks, gaining more charge and another super, enabling her to use back to back supers, pushing the entire team. 
---
3) While Rosa is using her super, she should be a little bit slower in speed than her current state. This ensure other players a chance to escape from her grasp rather than being able to stick next to her and not do any damage.
---
Utilizing all three of these suggestions may make Rosa too weak, but at least one should be used to ensure that players can kill Rosa.
---
Take mine as well!
---
What about prince
---
Stop whining. Just take these two steps --  1)  keep pressing super even when she's not ready for super  2)  enjoy the Day 1 chaos!
---
Stole by gedi-ko... oh wait
---
Nice skin btw, they should add more clash royale skins
---
Brazzers
---
Poco + rosa = unstoppable
---
We get it
---
I always did, he is awesome at start
---
I really want an actual frog brawler now. That would be awesome with sword and all take my up vote as well!
---
Not an exxageration
---
yeah thats true, but personally speaking i wouldn't be offended by some random person saying he hates me. also it's more peaceful to say "i hate X" instead of "kill all X" (theres a big difference imo)
---
Moms credit card
---
I'm gonna play colt on showdown I hope I don't get reduced!
---
This looks awesome, as always!
---
Croaker the cloaker
---
Rosa is way too fucking strong.  Sucked all the fun out of the game.
---
That is sad man. 1 token until box, 1 star token until a big box....
---
Rosa either needs a huge nerf, rework, or taken out of the game. Extremely overpowered
---
Please fix this asap. I really don't like voices and i'm shitting my self cause soon all brawler will have a voice that is as fucked as the rest of them.
---
I'm so happy some brawlers don't have voices yet. PLEASE, there is even a stop for this in settings. (look if you want, it's like it's missing)
---
Should of made this a Jif .. =)
---
Meow!
---
Spike getting no love I see
---
Star power need to rework/buff
---
Barley - increase attack area of effect
---
El Primo -¬† Super stun enermy 1.5sec instead knockback
---
Poco - increase healing effect normal attack
---
Penny - cannon shoot 2 target at a time if there is 2 or more visible in area
---
Piper - normal att when range &lt;50% will knockback target without distrupt channeling ability eg frank attack/super or carl super
---
Carl - while in super, normal attack change to grappling hook with a cooldown that able carl to instantly fly to targeted wall 
---
Tara - super affecting enemy that get caught will cause the enemy screen for 5 sec which only can see 4 tiles radius of brawler the other will become dark/fog
---
Crow - attack cause enemy slow movement speed by 10%
---
Spike - super heal and also increase spike movement speed in the area
---
Super improvement
---
Darryl - increase roll distance (underpowered compare to rossa
---
Bull - enemy caught by super also will be drag to the end of distance
---
I like the Shelly too
---
She is too OP, a level 1 Rosa has put my level 7 brawlers in trouble. She is absolutely unbalanced.
---
What about the girl rascal? Is that also El Primo?
---
Who's the rascal girl then? Rosa? :)
---
no shit
---
Pretty sure primo is obsolete now... Rosa does the same damage + has a better super + has a better star power + has more range + has a larger hit radius.
---
Hooipers
---
I RATET \*\*\*\*\*
---
There's¬†a¬†bad¬†platform¬†positioned,¬†for¬†the rest¬†is¬†good!
---
Her super doesn't get better if you upgrade her
---
Must be so endangered they never saw him :P
---
We need this in the game.
---
lmao I refuse
---
Lol, I didn‚Äôt catch that
---
Well for starters, the next one wouldn‚Äôt be too difficult. You do know that we can blow up walls at bushes right? We charge up our supers pretty quickly
---
Thank you!
---
Thank you &lt;3
---
I thought abou that. But I choice 'rascal' because of next brawler :)
---
mad cause bad !
---
*sirens*
---
Korea :)
---
His name should be Froggus the Great
---
Oof YUMP is a top player too...
---
R/iamverysmart
---
It‚Äôs not like I would have played against a bull at all recently to know that as everyone‚Äôs playing Rosa.
---
Do you know why that is? Because all competitive play is is everyone dickriding on the meta brawlers (one of which might as well be a heavyweight but has healing for some reason) I might not be the most educated person competitive wise but I can tell you that unless Rosa gets nerfed sometime soon she is going to be in a lot of comps from now on.
---
I saved 30 plus 3 bigs and got nothing. My brothers first box is Rosa. Fml
---
r/crowgang
---
Than I just opened a token box and a free big box and only got 3gems out of it smh fml
---
And you losedüòê
---
:)))
---
Maybe they did decreased shield protection as big brawler but I doubt it
---
I mean WHO KNOWS
---
Hmm make a comic about Rosa and the numerous other Rosas taking over showdown
---
Nah I think he‚Äôs just sad because the randoms won‚Äôt play with him again
---
no, just and idiot
---
I knew it!
---
I think having a super beefy tanky brawler is good as long as her damage is pathetically low

Ok supercell. After about 20 matches I can clearly tell that Rosa is way to strong! Her super is totaly broken and can be recharged quickly WHILE being almost invincible. Once she is in range of you, you are fked. While in her super, she can even tank the big ass canon from siege with no problems.   
---
. Make her slower while in her super  
---
. Change the dmg reduction to something like 50%
---
. Start testing your champs before releasing them \[...\]
---
???
---
I have a few more and some vids where you can actually shoot through the walls
---
WHERE IS POCOOO
---
8m?
---
2 options, get better or deal with it :D
---
No1 cares dude
---
Same here, was gonna buy with gems but then realized i had one box
---
I thought it was my internet or the rain. The matchmaking is slow! First match took a while then ended up with all Rosa match
---
In bounty she is at her worst. You can avoid her easily in bounty because there isn‚Äôt a stationary objective. In almost every other game mode she is far better as you can‚Äôt just avoid her in gem grab or brawl ball. Also the degree to which you lose when failing to counter her is too extreme. If you let her have an ult in the start of a round of brawl ball, she just carries the ball into your goal unless you can stun her, however that doesn‚Äôt kill her it just makes you not lose. 
---
A character that puts you in a situation where you either have a counter or lose every time is not okay
---
Congrats i got her on my therd box
---
Shes trash. Literally any of the randoms I meet cannot play her that well. They literally insta die when they attack. I dont have her though.
---
Mortis seems to be a good match against her though. He‚Äôs also op if you have a good team
---
A lvl 1 Rosa is fucking annoying. Imagine a lvl 10 Rosa with *fucking star power*
---
Sorry, I dont remember
---
But if you use frank she gets her ult and if she gets her ult in brawl ball you lose unless you can stun her and destroy your own defenses while she is still alive
---
Blog / Frade (Frog + Blade)
---
Or Swog
---
Refund gems, have you seen these guys with negative gems?
---
:))))
---
Then this means Night Witch Mortis is also a queen
---
Good Job master!
---
Went against 1 in siege , she took half of the Ike health by herself with 2 dives
---
ah what a great comic, keep up the good work!
---
El Primo!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
Yea yea, expect to take down a boss in less than 2 mins 30 sec with a random team using Piper's DPS and smashing walls using her super while you're not doing damage on Boss
---
Just to say that high range in Table Flip or Hunting Party is good for Anti-Boss means you're a starter or a classic ass random.
---
Expect Rosa bosses coming near you or in a big wide open field when they have to survive.
---
Poco is a skeleton you had to put in immortals
---
Except if it's Crow or Leon, cuz they're fast af, BOI
---
Lol, that‚Äôs a bummer. Make sure to have 20-30 gems on hand for the next card release. It takes awhile but it‚Äôs definitely possible even for f2p players
---
that would be a concept
---
Give it a catchy name like the Helter skelter and you got yourself a map
---
I see thepurefrost doesnt have number 1 in hes/shes power number
---
If so, I will obviously come back
---
Colt is too pretty
---
Of course SC will make big balance/test mistakes sometimes
---
But i wonder how bad this is going to get. Because an OP legendary brawler is one thing... but Rosa is just a low rarity brawler, everyone will have her in 3 days and she is OP even at level 5 against level 10 opponents
---
Duo Showdown in a nutshell
---
Shes op 
---
Its like who can get her super faster
---
I know I just restarted my game
---
So only have a few brawlers even if I use my main I would still end of with SC shaft but st least already have el primo
---
I preferred the el primo one
---
That probably sucked up your luck for 2019
---
Also collect the gazillions of free rewards from the new trophy Road and try mega deck (18 cards). You missed dragon egg mode though
---
\*Laughs in invisible healing mushroom\*
---
Ribberd
---
Well she's better than a legendary rn until she gets nerfed lol
---
it‚Äôs more than that if you see the pic ......
---
Forgiveness has been given. Have a Cool day
---
He was banned
---
Primo Gang
---
I'm aroused.
---
She is just rare. Spending gems would be such a waste. Wait a few days you should get her fast. I saved boxes and git her in my 6th box.
---
Yeah, sorry :D
---
Cuz i made it
---
I m a d e i t
---
If a character impacts the meta that much by forcing people to change what they play then it is a strong character
---
She‚Äôs really good in siege.
---
Agreed.
---
The down vote is for Rosa and the up vote is for wah bam Pam
---
700 * 3 is not a low damage bro
---
She's just really not that unique honestly
---
Legendaries all used to be like 529, right? Or am I misremembering?
---
Supercell is cracking down many top players allegedly doing freaky sneaky stuff to stay on top. These bans are mentioned all over twitter.
---
I don't think unboxing a rare brawler lowers your changes very much at all.
---
Whoa, then, were there more files added recently? The next brawler might be bomb dude, but after that?
---
a keen eye you seem to have
---
Glad I'm not the only one that thinks that lol
---
I think Tara is the most boring
---
what device do you use to play BS ?
---
Wait so Carl was a robot?? My life was a lie
---
Thats Right but idk why theres promotion like that
---
Gratz
---
We just got a new brawler my guy
---
Hold Up There Virgin, thats some good stuff
---
EXACTLY
---
She need a damage nerf
---
Only 19 gems! Yes, please. She is really good.
---
yup and most of the upvotes are bcz of new players. You can‚Äôt do nothing about it other than downvote.
---
Wan bam
---
stop reposting you shit. Fuck ur karma
---
But he didn't edit anything... üåµ
---
fuck ur karma stop reposting
---
Idk either but I broke down a while back and bought spike so it‚Äôs kind of annoying :)
---
leon still is strong af
---
Rosa vs rosa when both have super is the worst thing in the game
---
How about pro colt is only available to players who have Colt above 500 trophies? Thatd be a cool twist.... Maybe a pro skin series
---
Crow supered
---
What?
---
I'm saying people dont know how to fu‚Ç¨king use her
---
I wouldn't be taking advice from TheRapist anyway.
---
Exactly
---
Funny but no cuz of rosa
---
Totally agree with the second one!
---
r/2meirl4meirl
---
I don‚Äôt get it
---
r/lootstars
---
Well don‚Äôt you look like a dumbass now op
---
Not really. What he is Op in it is dragged down with how slow everything he does is. An attack is easily dodged if you weren‚Äôt caught of guard. And his super is OP in what it does. But again it‚Äôs slow and can be easily avoided if you pay attention to the frank
---
oops I didn‚Äôt realize lol
---
Yea, it might've gave me inspiration üòÇ
---
Nah Rosa is just overpowered and needs a nerf ASAP
---
Don‚Äôt forget to ckeck out the [full](https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/bhpq7d/model_showcase_another_round/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app) 3D model!
---
No, that would just end the fun of the game and supercell woulf lose alot of money
---
Yes.  It feels like when Leon was first released, except much more pervasive because of her lower rarity.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
With the release of Rosa, Leon, and - to a slightly lesser extent - Carl, it really feels like Supercell doesn't test brawlers before releasing them.  It was one thing to do that during the soft launch, but the game is live and people are spending real money on it: players should not be their first line of QA.
---
I love this and I have no idea why.

Spoiler?
---
I bought Rosa and my one big box I got motris
---
Luckly I got both of them
---
Thats some dope shit man
---
Why did you put an image of Rico?
---
Trophy count buster
---
I think ultimates shouldn‚Äôt be charged when certain ultimates are activated. Like Shelly‚Äôs ult shot won‚Äôt charge itself.
---
F
---
Is basically an El Primo that denies 80% of the damage ALL THE TIME because the super recharges unfairly quick.
---
Wow cool
---
Have fun
---
U did got pam and piper b4 reaching 1k so
---
damn the ones that lost are fucking devastated
---
Voice comfirmed
---
This champion is broken.. she needs Nerfs and soon
---
I hate when this happens
---
In conclusion, always have a stun character and this won‚Äôt happen
---
Darius alt account
---
STOP 
---
DONT DO PRIMO
---
Crow
---
YOU SON OF
---
Did they even test their new brawler in a game before releasing her? How is it possible not to realise how OP she is?
---
She‚Äôs got my vote
---
You guys did a terrible job balancing her. She is way way too strong right now. I mean an 80% damage reduction that is permanently up.. it‚Äôs terrible for the games balance
---
Why would they do this? It would be exploitable so easily
---
Mortis is as fast as crow/leon and Shelly has the default speed, fyi.
---
My silly friend put my address there! Crazy guy, Now i gotta blur it! Its funny,  i can use editing software well enough to make the pic, but have no clue how to remove text!
---
I still don‚Äôt have her.
---
Yeah I don't even want to push to 13k with those horrible rewards
---
&gt;Rip El primo btw good artwork
---
thanks!
---
***ROSA IS TOO STRONG,even unbeatable!!!!!!! I hate it! It's even better than a Robot in Siege!!! It's UNBEATABLE!!!! Even Piper's full range damage does little to ROSA!!!!! It's so Unfair!***
---
Of course bb &lt;3
---
It's funny because I had this exact same game setup when I played. Spike even got the same place
---
the fact that you have phoenix crow is reddit worthy
---
no one cares this has been posted 10000 times
---
Maybe there can be a cooldown between Supers before being able to use it again? I dunno.
---
Its surprising!
---
Aww, did you tilt?
---
nah because the fact she can chain supers is the problem, make it so she cant charge her super when its already active
---
382.
---
Also, I really don't know if I'm in the top 2000 or not. 
---
As far as I can tell, there really are very few people who play the game in Argentina, so I guess there's a chance. But other than that....
---
Abortis
---
:)))))))))))))))))))))))
---
Nice.
---
Her super charges too fast. It's annoying
---
 Hi, can I use your clip for a funny moments video? I will give credit. (i might edit the clip)
---
definitely
---
*Eh. I am going to Carl's. Leon, do you want anything?
---
people always think rares are super easy to get when theyre actually 1 in 45
---
Wizard Barley didn't exist before Barley's remodel, so I didn't include it
---
Poco plays more Megalovania
---
She broke the game. Too OP. Fuck the idiot at supercell who thought she was a balanced brawler
---
I wish I looked that Chad.
---
Dude she's been out for less then 24 hrs.  It would be so stupid to pass judgement right now.  That's hardly enough time to point at her and say she's too op nerf now!  Have you tried using brawlers like Piper?  She wasn't used that much in the last meta, but she's great at countering Rosa.  Wait till the community to start using range characters appropriately.  You also have to consider map make ups.  Open maps will not be kind to Rosa.  Same with maps with lots of walls.  She can't jump like El primo so she's constantly vulnerable to throwers.  There are a lot of answers to her, just think and play test and stop crying like a baby.
---
Yeah the thing is, as Rosa, once you charge up your super, there's a 100% chance that you can just charge up her super during a super, making her technically invincible
---
Yeah right down your mother's throat
---
Congrats I had 40 boxes saved didn't get Rosa..... But got genie and Piper!!! And the first next box I got was Rosa wow..
---
The point of the star tokens is to get you to play all the game modes and get good at them. I think this defeats the purpose
---
Oh ok thx!
---
Her super is better than most brawlers star powers I feel like
---
well considering 2min 30 sec per showdown game u get 48 games in 2 hours
---
considering u win all of them(highly unlikely)
---
u still get 7 X 48 =336 trophies
---
even if u consider 2 min per game it is still 60 games which is 420 trophies
---
how did u get 500 trophies in two hours
---
When the defeats equal 70 trophies I think that‚Äôs a bit too far
---
Is this meme any good?
---
Bock
---
God damn Bo
---
And If you hop in showdown with a new brawler besides Rosa, well too bad, cause that's the only brawler you'll find
---
So stop playing rosa
---
Is an offer they made so you don't buy Rosa
---
I got it too same lol
---
This is my friends picture, he told me to post
---
Can't really complain when you pull Leon
---
But if you can get the tokens by just losing it makes the game feel frustrating and since you never have to win you‚Äôre losing way more than you should. By making people play all the modes supercell helps them experience the full game and enjoy it to it‚Äôs full potential. I think the issue here is that siege needs a rework
---
ThIcC
---
Great tips, EXPERT.
---
ENJOY? THIS MY HIGHEST CHARACTER FFS
---
No context:*Yawn!
---
Facts El Primo knockoff bc they're running out of ideas she just has a different super
---
You should push your leon that's free trophies right there
---
All brawler are like that on release date... mainly with low rarity
---
Enjoy by being able to play all the game modes well. Like I said I think the issue is that siege needs a rework.
---
When in doubt *Rock* it out!
---
Yeah you are taking favorable match ups for her.  Have you tried playing against a good Piper or Brock?  Have you played on maps with tons of walls against throwers (she can't break walls like bull, Frank, Shelly nor can she go over them like primo).  A player whose good with Frank can be just as devasting.  Have you tried freezing her with Frank's ult and smashing her?  Some tanks are meant to counter other tanks and some are geared towards going after squishier characters.  You need to chill and wait a few days before you pass judgement.
---
That happened to me as well it is so annoying
---
Thats the first meme about rosa today, thatw as actually funny. Thank you. Take my upvote.
---
Maybe an option to turn on/off double rewards and trophies.
---
Good times
---
are you android or apple?
---
Rosa, for example lol
---
But if you learn to keep your distance she won't be able to charge her super and thus not as threatening as she seems.
---
The other one could be Rosa
---
Ohh a month how about a year
---
Plz reply to this so I can find it later so I can join?!!!

Im a simple man... I see Gedi-Kor posts and i automatically hit the ‚Äúlike‚Äù button. Hope ALL of your work makes it to the game!!

#leon‚Äôs edginess does it again

Didn‚Äôt this come from an animation? If so, I would like to see that animation.
---
:o, 13 coins
---
I got you
---
It's just good that the game is being advertised on a large scale, more players / players in general is SUPER important for Brawl Stars... without enough players, the game will literally die forever. I'm really happy to see this because it means more players will join!
---
Only in open maps where she can't reliably get her super
---
MIB!
---
It‚Äôs annoying Bc duo showdown isn‚Äôt even worth it
---
He hangs out with many female boxers, but gets none.

BECAUSE I'M NOT HAVING A GOOD TIME,  NOT HAVING A GOOD TIME!!

I also got spike today super happy but also sad that I got a legendary before Pam

As long as it‚Äôs not stolen content

Thx

Your plant is mine!
---
Ahh! A man of culture, you know the smug.
---
Oh my gosh, this is FREAKEN COOL
---
thanks now I feel jealous lol
---
In all seriousness, congrats
---
That would be something harsh considering no brawler has this.
---
Maybe hinder the super charge by a flat % (75?) so you actually have to go full berserk on the enemy team if you wanna keep your Super charged like Shelly does unlike using super, killing someone and having your super charged already.
---
OP refers to the player (which still has chances of not being a guy).
---
Can you atleast give the link for credit
---
We is anti-teaming? Whoever that is they got my vote!
---
lmaoo
---
This has been a lucky day for me. I got crow and Rosa. I went to my friends house for my science project and I got the rarest character in the game he played. The game I called The Battle Cats.
---
Translation: Wh a t?
---
Wow you‚Äôre smiling? That‚Äôs the pinnacle of happiness right there...
---
play with friends not randoms lmao
---
The three best brawlers way in the game
---
She is indeed op but those nerfs are too much. Might as well remove her from the game.
---
It is so clearly ignorant to judge a brawler only hours after being released it's laughable.  Have you played other SC games?  What are your trophies?  Are you playing with randoms? I've smacked Rosa's with piper, Brock, Frank, barely, dynamike, Carl.  She's strong but not game breaking op.
---
i think you are right the algorithm doesn‚Äôt factor in randoms or not just by average trophies
---
the part with the auto aim range is a myth
---
don‚Äôt play randoms my guy play w friends
---
hi yep anyone can join!
---
What really sucks is like for new players coins are insanely scarce. For instance I have the pp to upgrade like 10 brawlers to lvl 8 but only enough gold to do one, which I won't do right now because I want that gold to level up my newer lower level brawlers like Rosa and Crow. Then you get done with the scarcity and all the sudden you have an excess that is absolutely useless.
---
Anyone can join!
---
No shit!!  I think they realized they fucked up with Carl making him worthless.  Makes me think I need to run my trophies up on her before they make their inevitable nerf. Makes me regret not getting mortis up to 500 before they made him worthless in anything but gem grab
---
I opened 55 boxes and still didn't get her even though statistics say that i'm guaranteed to get her
---
‚Äúah-ahm... E=MC^2‚Äù *goes quiet*
---
how many trophies you have?
---
colt rico and msny others can chain super. she should get lower duration and less health
---
It requires 3 FULL ATTACKS just so u know
---
