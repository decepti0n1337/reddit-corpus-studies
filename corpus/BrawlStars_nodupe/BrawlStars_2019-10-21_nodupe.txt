Try it. Go outside and spray a bunch of hair sprays outside. Oh and invite your friends too. Make sure they bring alot of hair sprays too
---
---
---
It's a good reason. Then all we can do is hope they implement this on the game
---
12K without legendaries here :v
---
I don't play that much. Not more than 1-2 hours every 2 days
---
And put his beard on his head
---
Hureh-hurow!
---
Yes but her super does something completely different. I understand it has a similar radius but it for one follows her, and she doesnt throw it. Rico and colt have similar attacks but rico can bounce his. Emz has a similar radius but sandys doesnt linger. I see where youre coming from but i still believe that there are enough differences that shes not just a copy of sandy. You are however entitled to your opinion and i am to mine.

I didn't post that. And I think it meant the update that will come after the current one that's about to come. It's supposed to say that they remove all the megaboxes for trophybrawlers.
---
Don't forget about DJ Frank
---
Where did you find that image
---
i only need 74 trophies i know that i should have gotten it by now but i'm doing bad :  (
---
Pink/10
---
I know you can get 74 trophies bro :)  just do it
---
Awesome bro looks sick keep practicing you're getting good
---
Crap should not have used all my gems on shark Leon
---
Whean you open mega box you dont sure if you wiil won new brawler soo it wiil be okay
---
maybe they need to add another slot lol since we now have 3 modes rotate in the last 2 slots
---
That looks amazing! I love how dedicated people are to in the community.
---
Kairos time did this already but good job
---
10k trophies btw, should i save gems for sakura spike?
---
Letting em have it
---
I knew it
---
Like?
---
I definitely want one of these, they‚Äôre sick
---
This spike creeps me out
---
Good
---
That‚Äôs not that low though
---
Please cross post this to r/emzgang , we would love to have your artwork there!
---
yea but the problem here is i‚Äôm not active in brawl stars and i only play it at school eith my friends as i barely even play it at home, plus i dont grind trophies equally for every brawler like everyone do and instead i just grind to 500 individually for each brawler that i love the playstyle
---
Then why the hell is there a 1k trophies colt and a 950 dyna mixed up with 700s
---
If you look closely when they first introduce EMZ, a Penny lands a shot on another Penny. If you were to subtract the max health (4480) by how much she had left (3220) then you could see she lost 1260 health
---
Rule 34 artists: allow us to introduce ourselves
---
Why would you choose crow in life leech?
---
They did get a lot of views within hours according to Frank. They might do this more often. Haha.
---
Not this again!
---
Yea I have 8000 trophies right now and I got leon at 1100
---
for one second i thought sandy was the pet.
---
Awesome man ‚ô•‚Äø‚ô• ‚ô•‚Äø‚ô• I'm speechless
---
Most of the other icons aren‚Äôt at that angle, if you changed the perspective to be more foward this would be amazing

god damn tara's a thot

tara is a hoe

Neat.

It happens when you open the brawlstars app and play the brawl ball mode
---
I posted a video like this üòÇ
---
Plus, that 8 Bit is level 5, lower than yours and still managed to be star player
---
Incorrect. You can download for example Photoshop Mix from the App Store and Google Play for free, without warermarks.

Emz is the daughter Tara has with another guy but is still loved

Brawlstats.com but I was on the app.

Welcome and I‚Äôm relatively new to this whole posting thing so thanks for the compliment

I have Leon, also with his two star powers

a child, family pet? i think you mean *slavery*
---
Thanks üòÅ

Why?

My prediction of ‚ÄúBear leon‚Äù wasn‚Äôt too far off

What do you mean?
---
If ur coughing so much, I recommend u need to check ur family doctor
---
UGLY?! no way man
---
if you follow correct english grammar, you should say **Morti**, similar to cacti - cactus
---
Big brawler, play like nita, spend 20 tickets. You get around 3+ boxes a match (They last 1.5 mins max usually)
---
10k will probably fall sometime in 2020 and will be the last trophy road
---
good stuff!

It looks like moira from overwatch

Overwatch has to wait 3-4 months for new Hero. We wait every month for new brawler lol.

Pro tip: don't even try to get close to a 7 powercubes Piper with a super if you are a squishy brawler

You could‚Äôve just screen recorded it and then take a screen shot from the recording eh nice shot tho

So glad i didnt buy shark Leon after all

I hate this because now all limited edition skins are worthless

Sorry brawlers on my team

pretty sure its a screenshot from the bs vid and weather it takes how ever long this guy still put effort into making the pic and if it is stolen artwork then the person made this pic before was dumb not me im just looking at the artwork and it looks pretty neat why dont you try assembling a pic with brawlers lmao
---
Probably not :/

I loved life leech because crow was op in it

Oh that would've been better

Yeah that‚Äôs right

So was mine
---
I don't annoy if somebody kills me to get power cubes, charge their super and get a better rank, but I hate people killing me making me get rank 6 to 8 when they're going to get rank 10 anyway because they're not going to damage the boss until it has less than 10% HP remaining.
---
It actually worked perfectly. Those 3 were 100% in a team together. Idiot mike trying to carry his noob friends.

It be like that sometimes

Wow nice! You should upload the video!

Hey op shut the frickity frick frack up

I mean killing in takedown is only okay if you're low hp and someone kills you, you gotta take the opportunity sometimes, but when people chase you with their "WE LIKE FORTNITE" kinda energy it's annoying af

Video is really repetitive, robo rumble I feel is a really boring mode, only do it for the value. The Jessie definitely wants the second star power Shocky, Pam can use either one but I prefer first one. Last robo rumble, I spent around 800 tickets across 3 accounts, and didn't get below 6:15 a single time using this comp.

Nope, I'm atheist. It's just an expression I usually use

New brawler. Flong

---
Simple Recolors like Outlaw Colt, Pink Piper, and Iris Tara cost 500 star points
---
Recolors of Skins like Red Wizard Barley, Linebacker Bull, and likely Dark Dragon Knight Jessie will cost 2500 star points
---
No he had steel hoops
---
thank god emz not mythic it would have dropped my chance of legendary
---
He has the yellow shield
---
They changed her animations
---
She is the best waifu
---
satisfying at the point of time and then looks at ur trophies wondering if those starpoints were worth the trophies.....hmmm
---
Glad that Dark knight Jessie won't go...
---
Phew...
---
Double kill
---
nice AMT of trophies tho
---
at first i thought that sandy is family pet
---
shadow knight jessie is better anyway

GameGuardian doesn't work on Brawl Stars since everything is server sided. GameGuardian mostly work only on single player/off-line app. You're just salty, don't need to make 2 thread about this false accusation.
---
I just saw a YouTube video about how to use game guardian in brawl stars, it does work.
---
no,u HV randoms that rlly want to pull u down to their rank
---
are you from bs amino?
---
That Darrel doesn't need to reload

I'm not salty, I just want the truth

how much trophies tho

Hes a cactus. He cant have that much details on him. A freaking cactus. And on the other side, if you look at crows default skin, he definetely needs a remodel.
---
facts
---
Exactly
---
No. Leon doesnt have the best skins. The best skin in my opinion are mecha and robo skins and bunny penny.
---
Power play in the next update üòé
---
You're probably required to have dragon knight Jessie though
---
I really hope I can get the Ws in that bro

W?

Where is executioner Carl?

No. Its 80 or 150 for sure

W = Wins

L = Losses

it's slang

Oh, I have the same (hi from Russia)
---
They said that she will be.

There‚Äôs only like 10% of Russian community are [–ë–õ–≠–¢], but sometimes they really can ruin a whole match
---
Oh you get 50k if ur first and the rest idk
---
Hi from sweden to you :)
---
Maybe its you because how do you now its game guardian or how could u see his ammo slots???????
---
He is like me... Farting everywhere
---
Rip. I got leon about 3 weeks ago but I dont have gems fpr the skin and I already bough shark leon
---
I'm not asking for a League of Legends type of model, just for them to make Spike slightly more likable.
---
Wow good job my best is 5m 32s with randoms
---
Yeah sad :(((
---
which one?
---
Yup
---
Both
---
I have 108 gems so I might be able to buy it(if i had Leon)
---
U forgot HELL
---
Post a replay. Show some proof
---
Johhny johnny? Yes papa. Spinning at 1%? No papa. Telling lies? No papa.
---
Both are great
---
it will be filled with witch shelly after the update
---
#HAT OR NO HAT??
---
But his 2rd star power still trash.
---
Jesus
---
They should make a star power for 8-bit to make him faster. Change my mind.
---
It's called super not ultimate
---
Star points is better.
---
It's already possible to have two Franks. In fact its technically possible to have seven Franks.
---
Too shitty. √Ñ√§h try again dickhead
---
Neat
---
r/woooosh

You got wooosed

None, I had a Poco at 600+, but he's now at 530 something, because season reset+tilt.

She is fat

No

Hahahaha, Cant you draw something by yourself? You are desperate for attention, ask for dome to your mom, for sure she loves stealers

Appreciate it brother

I don‚Äôt like how this sounds

It's from clash royale

How do u do it bro ;-; good job tho

Nice job dude! 4k more and then i finish my trophie road :D

Am I a joke to you

He should be an mythic or even legendary cause it's way to OP

Buy token doublers, its the best bet.

Yes

Bitch what?

Anyone could make these fake pics

Your post has been removed, make sure to use the body of a post to elaborate on the title.

Bro, she is a trophy road brawler. So, you can get her after the update. She's at 8000 trophies üòÇüòÖ

It looks like a gene skin to me

Does it mean we can lick it?

WTF toxic kid just said this template is dead and u decided to use the swear words u learned at school bruh

Anyway love u too &lt;3

R.I.P in the chat lolü§£

Just use pixel crux and make it yourself

Not talking about buying, I'm talking about maxing a brawler and crossing fingers. It take ages to get the 2K coins needed to go from 7 to 9.
---
Enjoy the 2 new brawlers
---
Hmmm
---
Maybe a club member of yours reported you for bad behavior. I.e. bullying or harassing a fellow member
---
A gess she got it from pam
---
I've gotten 3 star powers in the span of 10 boxes and then I've been without one for about 4 months... So yeah, it all comes down to pure statistics
---
\-.- can you please stop, you're copy-pasting too much. And you're also karma farming with all of those repeated comments.
---
Oof
---
They said that they never give data for updates.there is balance changes like Darryl's steel hoops buff
---
I got exactly half that ^_^
---
with... sand? when?
---
Teaming has been a part of war since the dawn of time. Deal with it.
---
Dammit you're right, what a huge missed opportunity!!
---
DUDE. He just appreciates the art, he's not judging it by how it's made, like you. Stop viewing it by th process, and view it by the actual thing.
---
fk u
---
Meteor Rush Primo or Robo Retreat Rico are both even faster
---
When Sandy came out. When else?
---
Frig i never put water marks i hope they dont see this thanks fore pionting that out
---
I‚Äôm getting kinda tired of all the purple brawlers. 
---
Stop. There are many more interesting colours waiting to be used.
---
FOR CRYING OUT LOUD. STAPH IT
---
As you get 15 power points per box in average, you‚Äòll get around 1000 points which will not be enough to max her out immediately
---
‚ÄúFinally, I have them all.‚Äù
---
XD
---
I feel like this is offensive...
---
the randoms ruin that gamemode as hard as photoshop ruined that image quality
---
I saw it it was great
---
r/madlad
---
stop being too judgemental by how it's made, and why did that post get -5 points? He's just saying his opinion.
---
Dude ya
---
That‚Äôs the strategy. Picking off people lessens the damage they can do and gives the killer a better chance at dealing more damage.
---
That's what the devs said lol
---
Here, have my upvote. And to people who will downvote this, why? This is my opinion.
---
I think Nita and Leon are hooked up üòªüòªüòªüòª
---
It‚Äôs a repost
---
nice
---
Well i did manage to get 3rd place on that map as mortis
---
no i am russia i am not norvegian
---
Nice!
---
Thanks mate!
---
wasting attacks on other players isnt worth it for a potential 10% damage boost per cube. You could just attack the boss directly instead and end up dealing more damage. I think supercell intended the game to be more power cube based, but they just arent strong enough to make it the actual strategy.
---
That gives me a idea
---
Which speaks volumes. He wants the suffering to end so badly that hes willing to **hack into the mainframe**
---
Thanks bro, you are Breathtaking!
---
I‚Äôve spent 15-20$ on the game. I have all the brawlers in the game (Including 4 legies) 8 star powers, and lots of skins including Mecha Bo, Mecha Crow, and Robo Spike. guess I was lucky to have a 49 mega boxes for 49 gems deal.
---
Did you downvote me? Because you‚Äôre fully wrong, Leon with smoke trails is the fastest brawler in the game, I‚Äôll show you the stats if you want.
---
(‚óç‚Ä¢·¥ó‚Ä¢‚óç)‚ù§
---
Honestly i dont know anymore
---
And i'm here with 5 items remaining and legendary chance of  0,1760%
---
And then there's me, playing with 20x tickets and finding a Gene who pulled the first boss to the safe and then spinned until it was over. I wish him/her a serious disease :)
---
How do they even give sandy forgive me if I don‚Äôt know
---
This map is best for shooters
---
Thats sad you will probably get a new brawler eventually
---
Time to get to 10 000      
---
700 trophies to go
---
*That* is ok, what is not ok is when players treat Takedown as *Solo Showdown* and *deliberately waste other people's time and attack other people*
---
Bibi with star power is faster
---
I made this meme, you made it better, you win
---
I used a mouse
---
Lol, thanks! First legendary too. I pushed to 8000 last night to get the mega box and to get star points for the season ending deals and pulled leon. Im very happy.
---
Even Cavern Churn is better than this
---
Really, I'm playing since global release and i haven't seen teaming at that time.
---
I literally have star shelly
---
Callin FBI
---
spike may never have a voice since... ya know... he's a cactus... even in the trailer he doesn't talk
---
Yea
---
Not only the brawler but the skins too
---
Shave danis head now
---
Still I feel powerful ü§´
---
from what i've noticed here is what randoms pick most of the time:
---
\-shelly (99,9875%)
---
\-something like poco (0,0125%)
---
Season reset:7v7
---
Upvote for u sir
---
Well I've already remade him but I haven't posted it yet.
---
This is the same comment, I just chose to delete my original praise
---
Very tru
---
Ps. Im not included in the creator of skins sorry LOL. I just want to post here my idea
---
~~~
---
Isa is a frosty Brawler disillusioned with the world around her - but she seriously is frosty. Her Super summons ice statues which chase after enemies near her and deal damage!
---
Voice Lines:
---
"Go away..." (When hurt)
---
"Don't talk to me." (When hurt)
---
"Meanie." (When hurt)
---
"Ow..." (When hurt)
---
"It's so... cold..." (When hurt)
---
"I'm ice, not nice." (When dealing damage)
---
"I'll frostbite you." (When dealing damage)
---
"Sorry." (When dealing damage)
---
"I want to be alone." (When using Super)
---
"Leave me alone." (When using Super)
---
"Hmph." (When respawned)
---
"Urgh." (When respawned)
---
"No..." (When dead)
---
"I... I..." (When dead)
---
"*sobbing noises*" (When dead)
---
Do note all stats are at Level 1.
---
Health: 2600
---
Main Attack: Icicle Strike
---
Isa fires a sharp icicle, dealing 1300 damage. The icicle is so cold, it slows and chills enemies for 4 seconds. Brr!
---
*Reload Speed: 2.2s
---
Super: Isolation
---
Isa summons 8 Ice Statues in an area around her. The Ice Statues have 4000 health and 400 attack, melting after 7 seconds. They absorb splash damage and can only travel beside Isa. It's too cold for Isa to attack and be hurt during this period.
---
*Shooting only hits the Ice Statues.
---
*Charges in 5 hits.
---
Star Power: Solitude
---
Isa requires 2 less hits to charge her Super.
---
Star Power: You Are Not Alone
---
When near an ally or near an ally turret, and after 8s, Isa will give them a shield of ice that blocks an attack, regardless of strength. The charge up to the shield is broken whenever damage is dealt.
---
Rarity: Legendary
---
Class: Sharpshooter
---
EDIT:
---
Isa Nerf - Isa cannot interact with Gems, Bounty Stars, and the Brawl Ball while her Super is active. The Ice Statues will still do damage to Heist safes.
---
This is literally the worst part of takedown. IM SPINNING, THAT MEANS TEAM. I DON'T ATTACK YOU, YOU DON'T ATTACK ME. Oh, I get it now! These people don't know how to team because they have no friends.
---
same, hit 13.500 yesterday
---
I have only max tara and bull so that means I don't have any good chances od winning
---
Dude I'll give you my power 6 Tara for your legendary chance right now.
---
I actually think this could have been me, i was playing with a mortis and somebody else, luckily we still won
---
Seriously
---
Teamer
---
Hat obviously
---
It's in  r/brawlstars why would be any other game
---
I look at it this way - I need my ult and more cubes. If I‚Äôm pl 5 or something and you‚Äôre rolling up near me I‚Äôll kill you and return to doing damage to the robot.
---
Do you film all of your box openings or something
---
For real I think EMZ and Sandy are Mortis and Tara‚Äôs kids
---
Ok then I'm very sorry for you.
---
Contact support through email or just wait the 2 days, it's sucks though
---
Jokes on you. I got spike
---
You have been playing too much so you don‚Äôt open as many boxes as if you only played when you had tokens available. Sucks to suck
---
Cuz Supercell has more than 1 games..DUH?
---
Pizza tick
---
0,2314% is my odd of legendaries. Yet, I have full account, and 0 legendaries
---
Can i , ya know *shake?*
---
yes but only 3 times a day
---
I got 6 min 22 with level 6 jessie pam and 8bit
---
Ahh
---
why do you lack gold and powerpoints. i am playing since global, similar trophies as you but i have full powerpoints for 16 brawlers and i have 26 total brawlers.  you uninstalled game for some time? or you don't collect tokens everyday?
---
i stole it?
---
Meme ception
---
You have Spike
---
i would upvote but its at 69
---
I would rather not because my legendary chance is pretty high already and I don't feel like getting my luck down by getting Emz. I want to complete my collection and have new characters dammit
---
Yo i got sandy at 10k aswell!
---
Lol not me
---
Good bush scanner though.
---
Wow 4 tickets is pretty lucky the rest of the stuff was so bad though.
---
#*^HE*
---
It‚Äôs for end game players like me who don‚Äôt have anything else to do
---
Lol

it would take atleast 3 to 4 days. they will probably release it 2 days after content creators make videos of emz (in dev build)

I love it the details and everything!
---
it will take atleast 3 to 4 days . the content creators haven't even uploaded videos of the dev build yet.
---
Just a few mistakes to correct.
---
Wrong : 
---
8BIT : You won, get ready
---
Correct : Player one, get ready
---
Wrong :
---
Brock : Bam, brock got nerfed
---
Correct: Man, brock got nerfed
---

Dynamike : Down the mine

Correct: Dynamike

No, Mortis is King
---
Thanks mate, appreciate it
---
Cool
---
;-; just noticed i spelt your as you
---
powerplay sounds like a nintendo console from the 90s
---
speak for yourself
---
Yo, nice art
---
Perfection
---
Because on this children sub... on reddit. Already stupid af
---
He just pulled off an pro gamer move
---
I think they dont notice that
---
I have made meme with same picture
---
There are not enough words to fathom how much I fucking hate this rage inducing game mode. It‚Äôs literally to the point where I won‚Äôt even bother getting the token from the mode. No skill involved in this shite just pick a brawler with high frocking dps
---
Ur logic is stupid. Because your not lucky doesn't mean others are
---
yep
---
I wanna suggest an idea to you real quick can you make Tara a stand user with her shadow version that would real cool art if you could do it again this just an idea it would really cool if you did it
---
Yeah but they showed everything from the update.
---
Hold up
---
I know why it dont hits but I think thats a mistake
---
Mortara is better, change my mind
---
Or Comrade Darryl
---
Thanks! I corrected them all except for the dynamike one. Are you sure?
---
70...
---
8 bit, Pam, and a shotgun brawler,. Is the best combo. I got 6 min 54 secs
---
I unlocked Bibi and 8-bit today
---
Welcome to island invasion
---
The things people accomplish with this super never stops amazing me
---
3200
---
If you do the math
---
Outlaw colt was basically Rockstar colt
---
500 star points = 30 gems
---
Linebacker Bull was basically bull
---
2500 star points = 80 gems
---
If dragon knight Jessie was 150 gems
---
That would make shadow knight Jessie 5000 star points
---
Fjnny*
---
How so?
---
supercell gives time for the content creators to make videos of the dev build, only then will they release the update. and the content creators havent yet posted anything about the dev build.
---
I got here before it got in hot
---
But you followed him, when he did not want to
---

---
Sandy: Am I a joke to you?
---
crop is really hard
---
I can get like 10 starpowers but i never get any
---
Does this mean I get three boxes or should I save my gems for the October update?
---
Isnt bake sale barley considered a trap?
---
Can I get a video with audio lol I wanna hear your reaction
---
I sense something fishy
---
haha
---
This looks pretty good actually üôÇ
---
if you want the new skins save your gems
---
people are allowed to not play brawl stars
---
Furry brock
---
Finally an event/ modifier favors crow again I‚Äôm hype
---
After reading all answers, I think I'll go for Bibi and next brawler maxed will be Piper.
---
Thanks all for the answers!
---
I wish there gonna be not afk Shelly with super instead of Darryl
---
good one
---
No it was not perfect as the brawlers arnt maxed out. ( but still it is pretty lucky)
---
As once a wise youtuber said, tophat mortis is the only mortis people should respect.
---
This wise man is Lex
---
F2P or p2w
---
Congrats
---
If we cannot take it down then we shall vote it down
---
What‚Äôs it say
---
This should have instructions so i could make one XD
---
Someone already done this
---
The Gene photo was used when he was released, so all the way back in January. 
---
They probably have a whole Brawl World thought out already, just like Kairos theorized!
---
The animation is amazing. Good job bro.
---
Hey HEY these two brawlers were the ones I got just days ago! Same!
---
Emz: I'm gonna end this man's whole career
---
Fuck, I forgot
---
Wow thats rare
---
Now
---
#BROCK IS OP
---
it looks like it should be Mortis
---
Jessie Veraniega. There you go.
---
This was amazing ahahah...almost as much as my video that i posted a few days ago ;) if you want feel free to watch it and comments ;)
---
Well now you know it is an awful idea to pick Mortis in a map filled with close ranged brawlers
---
lol you've just used old el primo meme template and put the old el primo to no and new el primo to yes
---
He/she saw that the box had more than 6 items and got exited probaly. So he/she started filmning.
---
Someday.... someday.
---
Same
---
Hahaha yeah, idk, hopefully soon!
---
*helltrans
---
Cost:2000 gems
---
Yeah I took it at mid season. And yes, it is actually him. I clicked on his profile to check that day.
---
While raiding area 51
---
Tru
---
Darryl is doing OK.
---
you literally just grayscaled mortis
---
Let me guess you‚Äôve probably got a whole bunch of boxes you haven‚Äôt even attempted to open
---
what if ‚Äúcara simon‚Äù was in on it the whole time!?
---
How in the balance change?
---
Chill, i got this from bentimm1's new video
---
https://youtu.be/KeKoCaoNeDk
---
Barley could throw vodka tho
---
Look up Radical Rosh‚Äôs Balance Changes Video and it has some of Emz‚Äôs lines and Leon‚Äôs lines!
---
Blue outfit
---
You missed HEEEEEYYYYYY
---
Not the furries
---
**NOT THE FURRIES**
---
Thnks
---
i think its fake because there is no brawler that says a name of another brawler. i hope it not fake tho
---
No problem, the balance changes are kinda cool too!
---
well his super is now useless it will end before you reach the enemy brawler
---
There‚Äôs not really a better word for it
---
no its because all star powers dont charge super, like taras shadow clone, sandys rude sand sandstorm, pams damaging star power, el primos el fuego, jessies shocky bounces, and so many more
---
Yh
---
Yeah a 20 min video with prices of the skins because they didn't covered that.
---
Yeah but i haven't unlocked a new brawler from a box for atleast 2 months and i wouldn't have hoped much if it was just 6 because its either new brawler or star power but since it came as 7, i was so sure atleast one of them is a new brawler. Thats why i was a little disappointed to see both of them as star power
---
That means that I can‚Äôt save them to get power points for Emz? Sad :(
---
Leon is not a new brawler
---
The fact is: a long time ago, in a wonderful place, there was such a cool modifier called Life Leech (basically the new graveyard shift game mode, but applied to showdown and so on), but Supercell decided to remove it ‚Äòcause ‚Äúit was to confusing for new players‚Äù.
---
The end.
---
‚úåüèø
---
Wow, awesome
---
Mortis is the she dad
---
Duo showdown would like to have a word with you
---
Ahegao Emz
---
Because they buffed insiviheal so they needed to nerf his super to balance it out. 1000 heal every second is A LOT. But I do agree that the super nerf was not needed. Even the invisiheal buff wasnt needed. He should have stayed like he is.
---
Probable because you were complaining about getting two star powers in one box
---
Yes but noooooo
---
I wasnt complaining, i was just saying
---
Ikr...I was already having trouble pushing her...she was harder to push than a lot of my brawlers, and people say she was one of the best brawlers...
---
IT IS NORMAL .. IT NEVER LAST A WEEK .. UR FAULT THAT YOU DIDNT NOTICE BEFORE
---
I think 150
---
Why tf is leon being nerfed ? everyone is saying he is the worst legendary and yet they nerf him. bullshit
---
Why leon why
---
No I guessed it !!! Why ??
---
They are idiots
---
I want to shoot myself ._.
---
She can't catch a break

And also they didn't cover the new old game mod
---
selfie time
---
This is edited causev1 brawler = no power points
---
Why increase ticks mine duration whyyyyy
---
They nerfed his super because they buffed invisiheal. 1000 heal every second is really alot...
---
Damn boi! *SHE THICC*
---
Nah, he's a we'll know Brazilian YouTuber, he even launched Brawl stars for Brazil, also there's plenty of other videos talking about the same voices
---
#LOSER
---
He is her uncle
---
I... don't think robots can fall in love...
---
Now change ur flair mate
---
Even with a 1000 mbps I have to play on mobile data lol
---
Rip Mortemz.
---
Atleast it‚Äôs as dead as the couple
---
good buff
---
So this is the reason why i was able to watch the replay of a brawl ball match i played as colt when not having above 400
---
Mortis thinks pretty highly of himself, so idk
---
Use carl super
---
Damn and I only pulled creepy harvest today rip my luck
---
That don't even need a video.Probably the tommorw video will be like 5 minutes long to say that is nothing to cover
---
Furry Brock
---
Then... leon x nita confirmed
---
They will just respawn bruh
---
why they didn‚Äôt keep leon silent ? literally ruined the character for me
---
The starpower is not good
---
This is just angry robo showdown modifier except robo is extra angry
---
But they're brother and sister EWWWWWW
---
Not their fault lol
---
Wait until you try him to complain. For all we know it will be fine
---
It is
---
Mortis is his uncle
---
What videos?
---
Later
---
Well now no one complains about rosa's OPness, now it's mostly for leon's nerf the dem matchmaking and yeah 10k Trophy players with no legendaries
---
What are the lines?
---
As he should
---
U speak the truth.
---
i feel sad for you if its leon
---
When did u start playing then?
---
Honestly, they made leon even stronger in lone star. Just bounce from person to person in infinity
---
No, probably 80 or 150, from the looks of the model, he‚Äôs just darker red and gets cool wings. Unless there are some great animation changes that we can‚Äôt tell from the pic, it looks like an 80 skin
---
Nani!?!
---
%Nice health left
---
Her lines include
---
SKSKSKS
---
I‚Äôm going to beat you with my scrunchy 
---
And last but certainly not least...
---
AND I OOP
---
Welp that's disappointing. They keep neefing the ones that need changes not nerfs... They buff the strong ones and instead of buffing the ones who need it they nerf their counters...
---
link please???
---
and 8-bit's new star power
---
Thank you for putting your time and effort for these facts, I‚Äôm gonna commit no breathe, goodbye world.
---
nah clears boxes way too slow
---
bird
---
Mortis its his uncle
---
A -1 second nerf to his super
---
#good morning thats noticed before
---
How much like 10 minutes
---
No he dont needed to be nerfed
---
super from 7 to 6 seconds
---
Bruh, leon now is almost useless without his super, nerfing him again is unfair
---
Wait, is the new update on ?
---
Judging by ur Leon badge, of course you would think that
---
Bibi was supposed to be a guy in the video that showed video (right before brawl talk). Kinda ironic, but incredible art. It would be really nice if it was vector. Best art ever
---
I kinda like it
---
No, we saw it in one of the content creators videos
---
poor you, got him after he got nerfed hard
---
ha shit, any news on the date ?
---
i now bro he is a \*\*\*\*
---
Crow is still really weak in all 3v3 modes sd is his only good mode
---
*her and yes I know... I'm extremely sorry...
---
Thanks
---
This seems more of a monster type skin, that would fit Frank or maybe the new brawler Emz, for instance. Bibi is a punk girl that likes baseball, a monster skin is way too out of character IMO. But it is still amazing artwork.
---
Dude, they only nerfed it so that Leon‚Äôs invisiheal isn‚Äôt op
---
Old
---
Nani?!?!!?
---
Once again dont complaining until you try him
---
First of all i have leon and second you writed we two times
---
I like it :D #SNEAKYTIME
---
Bro yuo just posted cringe!
---
Your gonna loose subscriber!
---
he now has a cooler hammer
---
And why is this line a problem???
---
Lol shelly used illegal sites to nerf leon
---
Why is this downvoted, I understand the disappointment
---
Wait is this for real???
---
because they don't recorded the same time so the icon was here or not
---
Even supercell knows that kids say OMG.And they know dirty stuff its 2019 lol
---
It doesn‚Äôt take a rocket scientist to know that nerfing the only thing that makes him strong is going to seriously weaken him. This nerf is unnecessary and quite frankly will further eliminate him from the 3v3 meta. He‚Äôs already super underpowered.
---
Leons super and Meteor Rish were completly neutered. Why Meteor Rush and Leon needs to be killed?
---
hahahah
---
Where can one read up on brawl stars lore?
---
can anyone explain what leon says?
---
I thonk leon doesent needed a voice if he gets that huge nerf
---
Because this person is probably a Christian and this means something to him.
---
Nice
---
And you typed you writed.
---
I‚Äôm so happy he‚Äôs getting a voice!!
---
Thanks for understanding
---
I mean i usually get around 38s, so ya i‚Äôm pretty fast
---
She is one of my most played brawlers and she is still gonna be good people are really overacting.
---
haha i can speak now
---
fear me
---
Why would u play him in the first place? There‚Äôs always someone better to play
---
here your first like and comment
---
Edgy teenages be like
---
Mortis is confirmed Emz‚Äôs uncle so either Frank is the Dad or BF
---
Nani
---
everyone who didn't play plant games vs zombies: 
---
I am a joke for you?
---
Exactly everyone thought that nerf was good why did they change it back
---
Yeah but bibi was really good so why?
---
Most of these are absolute trash
---
Bull and Darryl basically have the same star powers except Bull activates his when low in health and Darryl activates his with super.  Still a nice buff for Darryl tho
---
Genial se ve tan bien cool it looks so good
---
r/brawlrecruit
---
I have to clarify what I'm going to do with this post
---
They just destroyed him..
---
It's not even a rework and it isn't a great change at all it just makes leon starpower dependent
---
Ye
---
I see no God up here. OTHER THAN ME
---
So you get star tickets by using star tickets? Or do you mean 32 tokens per ticket?
---
Shelly nerf super plssssüò≠
---
Token* ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
and buffed an unnecessarily strong character again
---
i like that it's a simple polish, all frank really needed tbh
---
He's my favourite brawler
---
Give me a pack of eggs supercell
---
When leon isn't op but you still nerf him:
---
Put this in HOT for supercell to see this....They don‚Äôt think twice
---
There is a play again button bro...
---
I prefer the speed, but the shield is supposedly really good as well
---
"#NoFilter" *Skins disappear*
---
a rework means a buff and a nerf in once change idiot, and its good hes SP dependant since hes going to better at higher trophies now while being not as op when lower in trophies
---
you're already making some pretty cringy poetry my guy
---
#nofilter
---
I have 8,5k as a f2p I know there is more f2p players that have more trophies but you know I am proud of myself
---
Balances change to SP are so annoying, it doesn't affect most players.
---
O no 8 bit what have they done XD good art tho
---
ITS LEGIT HOLY CRAP
---
He needed a buff in the first place but now they're going too far
---
Agreed
---
He is actually rlly good bb and gem grab
---
Oh in that case, good job, max I got was 31 with 6:13
---
All the detail!
---
Wait, is this a real thing, or only and idea, as the flair suggests?
---
Actually that's the color of a friendly Brock. This also applies to Dynamike.
---
Lmao
---
Thanks üòÇ
---
Holding hands is shipping
---
Some people just...want to see the world ...burn.....
---
Oh ü§îü§îü§î
---
It is? Is it just for Halloween?
---
You do realize that his super is utter trash now right? Even with smoke trails it'll only be viable with invisiheal.
---
There Is no post
---
................What.....?
---
Best skin = Win
---
He means autoaim
---
Instead kf nerfing bad brawl and buffing good one how about ya buff mortis and nerf shelly
---
All you with high chances
---
I'm at like 0.0357% so I don't expect anything for a good month or two
---
Can we just appreciate the update and effort into this? Stop complaining and be happy with what you have
---
Her super charge needs a nerf
---
It‚Äôs Carl without the lisp
---
Tick + Crow = the most annoying brawler
---
R.I.P. Spike the ONLY legendary who dosen't have a voice
---
ticket events exist for a reason- make sure you gather up a decent enough team (unless you're playing big game), bet 10 tickets if you're playing robo rumble, profit 
---
and also, push your brawlers enough to be able to get a mega box at the end of each season, it's definitely worth it and will speed up progression quite a bit
---
But Leon didn‚Äôt need a nerf he was fine. If anything he needed a buff.
---
O no sandy has a masive white pimple XD
---
You wasted the opportunity for colt's name to be "you lost the game"
---
That's... kinda the point of the character. It may not be appealing, but it fits the character.
---
You took the letters straight from my keyboard
---
I don‚Äôt want to live on this planet anymore.
---
I don‚Äôt want a legendary i want fuckin mortis (or opibi)
---
Duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh~
---
Mortis, please don't do that, you're his uncle
---
I think that's the point... it suits her so well.
---
*Lord forgive what we're about to do*
---
I hope this is me in the near future...
---
I have Leon, hoping for crow
---
Both legit anyway... Probably I go for shield. Thanks!
---
Thanks!
---
Did u just say shelly is hard to play? She is literally the lowest skill cap brawler in the game
---
Yeah as someone who plays exclusively Frank in Brawl Ball he can dominate if Bibi isn‚Äôt against you. I still think Frank‚Äôs super makes him better at Brawl Ball over Bibi but not by much. I don‚Äôt have any of their star powers too so maybe that would change my mind.
---
I think they balance them to much. Almost all the balance changes are with star powers.
---
haha sure, only when your teammates get him to 1 hp right?
---
How is this brawl stars related?
---
Good job
---
Ho, mukatte kuru no ka? Nigezu ni kono DIO ni chikazuite kuru no ka?
---
Hahaha were these randoms? If yes, they are worse but not too much than the ones I get
---
Why do people think Shelly needs a buff? She can take out almost any brawler. She‚Äôs too op. Her super charges extremely fast, she has a long range, her attack and super attack does lots of damage, so why does she need a buff? She‚Äôs the first brawler everyone gets! She shouldn‚Äôt get so many buffs that she‚Äôd be the best in the game! Too many people use her. There‚Äôs no variety in game modes like showdown. All you see is shellies. In every single showdown game there‚Äôs always atleast 1 Shelly. I have never been in a showdown game where there‚Äôs no Shelly. It‚Äôs honestly so stupid...
---
Yeah,we need a button for if we want to use it or not
---
laughs in crow and spike at 10k
---
Guys did you realize that Leon is getting voice??!!
---
The pumpkin head tick sounds amazing! I wish supercell would look more often to the community skin ideas
---
Aww shucks, its ok if a fellow poco uses my idea! Any time friend!
---
Are this changes already in the game? If not, when are they going to come?
---
Jessie devil?
---
8BIT NUUUU! WHY U DELETE URSELF???
---
Where's the mortis buff to reload time?? I'm sad
---
He probably is, but it still sounds weird af haha
---
Where's the damn mortis buff
---
Cool i relly like it good job
---
?
---
Japanese anime is making us barff rainbows so much where is the movie that you finish making it with the first animation of brawlstars no time to explain where snd ti on video.
---
Are you sure? Did you even see a single game on high trophies? Everyone will target you, you idiot. It‚Äôs impossible to win 7 vs 1.
---
Your freaking spike is literally the lowest skill cap brawler in the game. ‚ÄúMoRtIs Is ThE hIgHeSt SkIlL cAp BrAwLeR!1!!1!1!1‚Äù
---
look at my name. Respect it
---
XD pipers face
---
Yeah. He‚Äôs a LEGENDARY brawler. He costs about 700 gems. There‚Äôs a bunch of brawlers that are better than him. Does that make sense? He doesn‚Äôt deserve this nerf!
---
OH MY GOD LOOK AT HER PHONE SCREEN LOOOL
---
I hope so
---
Jajajaja
---
*Nice.*
---
I'm on 6000 with only rare and trophy road characters
---
That would be too much content for Supercell to add in a monthly update. All gamemodes will either be with other players or pvp.
---
I agree that that would be too op, but I also agree with him. The nerf should be canceled.
---
Not sure, but I guess brawlers who are fast (like crow) or brawlers that have a star power that increases their speed have a good advantage in both duo and solo showdown.
---
so glad leon was nerfed
---
the creator stole this meme, he cancelled out the person in the middle's text. It's very obvious.
---
Good job i gess atleast you got the token
---
I used those star points and got Sandy from that mega today,what is Kairos Code? I wanna support him on all of my profiles too
---
to be honest piper only got a small damage nerf and it's enough
---
From daily gameplay &amp; from KairosTime's video:
---
https://youtu.be/ZwOlYbmtgfU
---
Such a shitty Piper nerf. Ffs
---
We were _this_ close for Jessie and Penny to be indentical
---
You can recontext it to mean that Mortis loves (In a family way) his niece a lot and Frank (who were going to call her boyfriend) is embarrassed
---
Real artists draw with real hands. Epic!
---
*Shhhhhhhhhhh*
---
Thank you so much!
---
What the heck?
---
If she was decent Penny should also be decent, yet they buffed her
---
Yeah it does. Not even level 35? lmfao get out of here scrub
---
This is music to my eyeballs
---
thanks!
---
He shouldn‚Äôt talk it should be sound effects though
---
Why the fuck are they buffing crow??
---
Nice. I'm at 9.8k. I'm bringing my brawlers up to 500 one by one right now
---
Surely an Undertale reference
---
Buff Leon
---
Buff Bibi
---
Buff Sandy
---
Buff Crow
---
Buff Mortis
---
Buff Pam
---
Buff Gene
---
Buff brawler chance
---
Nerf Piper
---
Nerf Barley
---
Nerf 8-Bit
---
Nerf Bull's shiled
---
Nerf Rico's robot retreat
---
Fix Frank
---
Fix Rosa
---
It's the best balance change i've ever seen (Great Nita buffs)
---
stop complaining sub-8k player.
---
Yeah Sandy is a male, it‚Äôs just an error.
---
At least now I can basically use the super, pick up the ball, and walk straight into their goal with invisiheal
---
(username checks out)
---
What about the D next to the big box
---
He is already the worst legendary brawler...
---
And then a 20 powercube pam kills you before you can get there.
---
You just gave me a great idea! Maybe I could change his facial expression from hearts to  simple happy eyes that would say something like "Awww isn't she adorable!"...
---
Thank you, whoever you are. I don't know why I haven't thought about it before but you saved my life!
---
Leon officially confirmed he didn't have puberty yet
---
Could've just nerfed the INSANE +800 ambush damage, but I guess that's too mainstream.
---
‚Äú*did someone unfollow me?*‚Äùwhy is this literally me on insta
---
Cool i relly like mapel barley
---
How is spike the lowest skill cap brawler when all you do as shelly is auto aim and chain supers. Spike is higher skill cap than crow buddy lmfao. Shelly is the starting brawler for a reason stop being so ignorant
---
Happy cake day!
---
I know right mind as well say that that Leon is op. I feel bad for him, I ENJOY HIS MECHANICS.
---
He might be on the cusp of Aries and Taurus.
---
GIVE DARRYL SOME LOVE
---
Used text to speech converter and didn‚Äôt get the feel of Megalovania. Perhaps a rework of your syllables is in order?
---
This is why i love supercell. Their attention to detail is amazing
---
A bit like Sandy. I was not expecting him to sound like Colt at all, but they're almost identical. His voice lines match, at least
---
It fits her
---
Nice artwork, here are som tips from a 12 year old artist:
---
-Try adding more intense shadows, i use a sort of ‚Äútrick‚Äù where I draw the normal shadow and then a bit of cell shading over it
---
-add some clearer highlights 
---
!Very important thing I realized too late!:
---
If you‚Äôre planning on doing a character that stands out you can use any sort of background, just make sure the character is separated from it

If not then draw a own background wich might take a while but is worth it
---
So basically:
---
More intense shading and highlighting
---
Either uninteractive or interactive background
---
Hope this helped
---
Morris need a buff ? Please god no, he is REALLY insane right now, he don't need anything.
---
I saw the origanall it was good this won is still good i feel relly bad fore the backlash so tacke my upvote
---
not funny didn't laugh
---
discounted token doublers= more worth it
---
just save your gems for discounted token doublers, so no
---
or your just a heavy gemmer and you don't want to wait then it is worth it
---
I'd rather forget it, thanks
---
Ya this totally isn‚Äôt a joke
---
they must remove this map,its not fun.

Emz is vsco. She also says ‚Äúur not getting a friendship bracelet‚Äù and ‚Äúslskskskskksks‚Äù
---
Ok boomer
---
what? can you explain further
---
Then...just nerf carrion crow? /facepalm
---
Why why and why?
---
I got dragon knight... *angery noises*
---
I mean... I once spawned next to lot of powercubes and bot was next to me
---
Next thing i knew, it chathed away
---
nice drawing
---
Not nice, didn't nice-d
---
Hold up hold up man, you didnt do the math.
---
Next thing you know El Fuego lasts longer than Leon's super
---
Bufding invisaheal does nothing bc now leon wont be able to do anything w his super unless he has speed ao tge nerf cancelled out the buff and hell suck w o speed sp
---
Ipppphhhoooonnnnnneee 11 (I wish I had that phone tho) nice drawing
---
Guys I have not been on this reddit or the brawl app since tick came out. What did I miss?
---
it is fair, matchmaking depends on your trophies,not power level, and it means the Frank is "good" if he got 460 with power 4
---
BEGONE
---
I agree with the problems that had not been solved yet. Just here to say that crow's star power was  completely useless. Now maybe we can use it
---
yes
---
Spike is still better than crow
---
If you divide the cost by the number of boxes, you get 40 gems per mega box. That makes it 30 gem saving if you do the deal.
---
F2p players can get gems
---
Wow that‚Äôs high. Sounds higher than mythic chances even. I have two legendaries, both acquired around 0.08% chances. But I‚Äôm lucky, others have a percentage like yours and none. That‚Äôs the thing with probabilities, there is always going to be someone who doesn‚Äôt get them even after years...
---
Im not giving you a freindship bracelet. (something like that)
---
We do know it is this but I think this is not the final artwork for the second
---
these balance changes just keep getting worse and worse
---
Bibi: Once again, another nerf. I stop playing as the game started getting repetitive, but maybe it‚Äôs time to buff other characters that she has outshined rather than nerfing her to the ground?
---
Primo: I really don‚Äôt see why we can‚Äôt comprehend this. Nobody cares about el fuego, as long as i‚Äôm moving faster with meteor rush, i‚Äôm using it. Why? Because it makes up for an area that el primo lacks in, charging / recharging his super. I don‚Äôt need extra damage, either rework it or get over it.
---
Leon: Same as primo, make invisiheal useful or get over it. The movement speed makes leon better, not healing when it‚Äôs unlikely you will even be taking damage. Buffing invisiheal was also no excuse to to nerf the super. He isn‚Äôt even that strong so i don‚Äôt know what your goal is.
---
Brock: It just seems like when it comes to this star power there is generally a lack of comprehension. Nobody cares about making a small circle of flame that people will hardly ever walk in. That doesn‚Äôt even take the slightest drop of effort to understand. Even worse it‚Äôs just a double edged sword. You‚Äôll keep increasing the damage till it becomes so OP against stationary targets to the point where it has to be nerfed. Rework it or forget it.
---
Crow: Playing with fire and we all know it. Why don‚Äôt we give him buffs that will make him useful, like a slightly increased super charge rate, rather than buffs that will make him more annoying. Doesn‚Äôt take effort to understand.
---
Darryl: I just find it funny that everyone knows that darryl‚Äôs steel hoops should never be below 30 percent, and yet it always ends up that way. Stop changing it and fixed the things that are actually wrong with him. As for rolling reload, same as primo, same as leon. Nobody cares. People use steel hoops because it helps darryl improve in an area he lacks in. Instead of aimlessly making changes, let‚Äôs use our head to see what we can do to improve darryl‚Äôs second star power. Since darryl is generally weak without his roll, we should consider making rolling reload into a star power that helps darryl when he doesn‚Äôt have his super charged. 
---
Poco: This one is a personal opinion, but is just like to see poco reworked as a whole. He‚Äôs just so simplistic to the point where it‚Äôs boring, and it reflects on his star powers as well.
---
Spike: It‚Äôs honestly just a general lack of intelligence when it comes to balancing this brawler. Spike has a star power that literally hits people just because you in his main attacks vicinity. You literally can‚Äôt dodge it, so what do you think needs to be done?
---
I don‚Äôt expect everyone to agree with what im about to say, but it‚Äôs really the general lack of results that have made this game boring. Nobody needs a brawler made from recycled parts, spend your time adding things that will actually improve this game, not just add to it. Clubs have no purpose, the trophy road is horrible, daily rewards aren‚Äôt even anything worth batting an eye toward and so much more.
---
Not fair! You got me!
---
Well, shucks! It HAS been a while since I updated it! Idk, would you say I'm beyond subpar?
---
Sorry for the repost but I just wasn't comfortable with the gross incest stuff...
---
Next time I'll try to hold my tongue before jumping to conclusions.
---
Hell yeah.
---
I'm just saying it is unfair because my frank is at power 4 and his is at 8.
---
Someome called me?
---
Don‚Äôt forget Leon getting a voice
---
Why
---
discounted token doublers still more worth it
---
But i bet ppl will still ise carrion crow more id honestly know
---
I prefer Spike but Crow‚Äôs gotten a lot of nice buffs. And he‚Äôs getting buffed again in the update. Spike too but only to his healing super.
---
The code to the template guy is r/RITOMB
---
I saw the origanall it was good and now i see this wher you fixsed it up it relly good im sorry fore the coment but mortis is her unkle this is relly great art i hope you keep up the great work
---
Oh look, are you a brazillian?
---
&gt;Doesn't have Sandy yet. 
---
Relatable, and that's the most sensible part.
---
She's a mf vsco girl not even bs is safe
---
But it isn‚Äôt as of right now.
---
He shaved beard for us!! Press F to pay respect for his beard
---
I would say he should receive a 0.5s or 1s buff to invisibility duration
---
The doritos...
---
Mortis, B-B-Bringer of ants!
---
Nita buff is shocking
---
Drew (cr cm) also dyed beard for royal ghost costume
---
wow, complaining about getting a legendary boo hoo
---
I have max piper with only ambush (but its broken now so thats cool). Thats my only max brawler, im pretty lucky I have that 1 star power
---
Its tomorrow i think
---
I love darryl
---
Odd how the entire subreddit was once knee deep in ‚Äúgive us Leon VOs‚Äù memes, then...
---

Either way good job!!!             :)

Shotguns shoot shells, not bullets (I mean this to aid you on your quest)

More destruction and more shellys? Ah shit, here we go again.
---

---
