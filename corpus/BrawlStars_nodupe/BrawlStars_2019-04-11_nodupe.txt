Yes i do, a find more friends cuz my clan doesn't play with me buff :(

If you had used anyone else besides Bo you would of lost his star power is good on that map

Now look there are a lot of things that can lead to having star powers really early. 
---

---
1. You paid money to the game ( which i did, opened 3 mega boxes)
---
2. You climbed trophies so slow which means you had opened more trophy boxes and big boxes
---
3. You were really lucky and got a lot of power points for a character you liked and got the star power.
---
None of them happened to me, unluckily. At 3300 trophies i have no character to reach 9 so far. Maybe it's pure unluckiness :/
---
I love you

What did you bring a pon this cursed land.

Yessss

So are we suggesting that we spawn both robots at the same time at the end, with their power being based off the bolts, would the stronger robot not win in the middle anyways? And then you got a half dead robot fighting the turret at about the same time everyone else spawns again from the epic battle

That‚Äôs actually a great brawler idea- someone who can multiply themselves as two as their ult:) Upvote this comment to 200 and I‚Äôll make a concept idea)
---
You will quickly realise the only one worthy of the title ¬´¬†legendary¬†¬ª is Spike, since hes the only one viable in any mode that isnt like 3 maps of showdown.
---
How can you be at 3 k in 1 .5 half years? I mean that explains all the maxed brawlers but you know, it's not really that hard climbing. I started 2 months ago and at 3.3k. The game is getting kinda boring to me since i didn't get anything for 50~ boxes now and everyone i come across has star powers which is not really fair.

Not bad.

But was it slso spewing profanity XD.
---
But he's helped by his toxic daggers and the fact that he's a really mobile brawler. Crow is strong, might even need a nerf.

Is that legal?

The text in blue is what a kid in school would say to their friend. For every brawler, let‚Äôs pretend they are the kid‚Äôs friend. The text in gray represents what each of the brawlers would respond as according to their personality. For example, poco is a good friend and will help you understand the concept, bull is the kind of guy who forgets they had homework.

r/mixedemotions

Actually, Primo isn‚Äôt garbage in Siege. His tankiness and dps allows him to pressure the map and secure bolts, and his Super can be used to deal about 20% damage to the safe or more. However, they have to know how to do that...
---
Dynamike would be ‚ÄúI‚Äôll help you with it‚Äù as in ‚ÄúI‚Äôll team with you in showdown‚Äù
---
My bad my so LOW.
---
Great idea, but im 99% sure they won't. They don't want to fill their servers with map creations. only 1% of those would be seen and used by the community in general while the other 99% is taking up storage space and no one plays those maps. I mean off-game map creations tools already exist; it should be good enough.
---
(also I could bring up the pay to play arguement, but whatever.)
---
It‚Äôs okay, but when you‚Äôre playing at low trophies and something really cool happens it really sucks when you realize that you don‚Äôt have the replay available
---
This is how spike was when he was very op
---
Learning how to stop teaming
---
Very cool, but why would you wan't to buy two dynamike's star power?
---
Too much
---
Darryl wants to know your location.
---
No other brawler goes to the extreme such as dynamike and barley
---
Why do I see the heavy from tf2
---
Bro you funny
---
Lol
---
No, Tara's Star Power looks different, has decent health, moves faster, and has a melee attack. My idea is that the copy would be exactly the same as the Brawler, except it has almost no health.
---
Everybody gangsta till the turret start walking
---
uhhhhhhhhhhhhh
---
but I'm not joking, literally everyone who plays showdown teams, mortis teams with dynas, primos team with shelly's, it's pathetic.
---
English?
---
r/itswooooshwith4os
---
I am too. I'm just saying it's funny.
---
noob teaming pams
---
Yeah because gemmers are stupid enough to not buy a key doubler
---
Technically, since you‚Äôre pulling more rewards out of them, yes. But in practice, you could go 10 Big Boxes without a brawler and still unbox one from a regular box afterward
---
Cool skin!
---
use manual aiming.
---
that's the point of the game.
---
Super created a teaming dynamite lmfao
---
Colon
---
thats why i said low dps. his poison lasts a while and overtime does a lot of damage. the first hit doesnt usually deal too much damage compared to other brawlers. He also does a little more damage at close range, but is desgined to be played on the sidelines, which doesnt make sense. yes his super can account for that, but at long range its still sort of tricky to obtain it.
---
I think that you should make the rewards bigger. A chest with 8000 health should have more rewards to reap.
---
Yeah I totally agree that it looks sick but it‚Äôs still hella freaky
---
Just got leon yesterday
---
lol add kirby's callling the police to this
---
If any thrower needs a buff its dyna cuz his shots are just like barley, they can hit twice, but they got a fuse timer or them while barley is instant
---
Uh....no.
---
ayy i just got him yesterday
---
For sure. Post it on the subreddit when you reach 10k!
---
5. Pay attention to the IKE % at top. Against penny's. But if its below 25% and have a bull. Kiss it good bye if not super to it.
---
Make Shelly‚Äôs super have unlimited range. Slowly heading towards them before they get one tapped
---
I did this same thing but with leon at power level one, yes getting leon was a stroke of luck but it was fun, gj for that 500 shelly
---
Petition for @SuperCell to add updates to Brawl Stars much more often.  In the age where games are adding new skins and storylines and the like to games weekly, @SuperCell NEEDS to release similar updates in a much more timely fashion if they want to keep people interested.
---
pootis pow!
---
that was going to be the main theme xd that is why it is drawn pam that is very strong and crow that is a bit weak in the current meta, Anyway, thanks! (Srry my english)
---
This gave me anxiety
---
You can do it in the May update if you want because I am sure there is going to be a ton of stuff already I. The April update :)
---
r/brawlrecruit my dude
---
They would need to be against the same brawlers, because you could get cheesed due to the enemy being a thrower and staying behind terrain the entire match where you couldn't hit them. 
---
I would favor more of you each choose one brawler and have a match against that one brawler.
---
I saw this art long ago, it was made after the Mortis remodel but before top hat Mortis. Original artist also had top hat Mortis on the left side of the picture but person who made this post cropped it out.

I hope this is not refering to showdown, like a campaign?
---
usually i dont lose, but its more like why the heck are you running  your freaking **turd**
---
I think you're the person that likes to throw game.
---
They probably make one. But in my opinion it will get abuse later on. Like showdown teamers. Trust me. Someone will abuse this game mode.
---
there is this thing called photoshop
---
A map without spawn points! Great!

It is look at the rarity and you see the rarer it is the more unique

I guess

do u have any mythics

It's crazy that meteors are supposed to stop teaming but it's the modifier with the most teaming

But I still think crow don t need a buff

I know, his team must of been mad at him

The game was way harder back good old portrait times
---
"you main anyone?"  
---
"nah not really I only main Jessie"  
---
"oh, I don't see anyone having Jessie as a mai- what the fu*k"
---
This is another great idea, forces people to actually aim if it‚Äôs closer than the opponent and in cases where things are based off initial damage like penny and Jesse and even Tara , maybe allow Gene to pull them? Idk 
---
But bravo this should be in all game modes

That sounds boring af, that‚Äôs why you pick 3 brawlers yeah maybe you lead with bull and they lead with Barley, but your next brawler could be mortis and you got him for sure. That‚Äôs the point of choosing 3 brawlers.

Imagine 2 mortis sliding around and never killing one another cause they move away. Gotta have a time limit on it too.

because the game doesnt have enough problems with other things to be adding more content

Are you releasing it?
---
Bull.exe has stopped working

this might be the best response to teaming I've ever saw. Weather you team or not someone you know in your club or who you play with probably teams the only way we can stop it is if we either don't play showdown (so they'll be forced to remove it) or stop teaming. (btw i have no problem with pinching or forcing people into other people but going to the mid as pam and taking out anyone who wont team with you or the Dynamike/Barley thing is what i dont like.
---

10.3k, the only legendary I have is the one I bought.

Then quit. Go ahead. If you just give up that easily you can feel free to go. My friend had all rares, super rares (excluding Carl he didn't exist at the time) and Piper, and he got to 7k with that amount of brawlers. Then he really started getting brawlers. Just so you know you shouldn't really get your hopes up for a mega box, it's just 10 small boxes merged into one.

I dont understand this

Every time i play shelly im doing this
---
Well yes, but more FPS means the battery hold less, ie shorter. I every game play on phone at 30fps due to the battery. It's not problem for me, but sometimes the brawlers coincide with these textures and I do not see them. My phone sometimes gets hot if I have more FPS.
---
Why does this feel like another thrower-teamer
---
Ok I use Barley too, they're both at power level 5, almost 6, just need 20-30 more cards. Didnt like using others like Carl, shelly, poco, bull. Used nita too for a while.

Youre teaming too? Its not backstabbing if you team untill youre ally is almost dead. Backstabbing is using the spin to get close and immediatly kill them. You just teamed cuz you used the rico to get kills.

I sometimes lose control of my brawler, like the buttons become unresponsive and the brawler keeps running into the direction you were going. It lasts for about 5 seconds and can be annoying. (I lost some trophies on different modes because of it) But it  happen too often at this point. My screen isn't dirty i just bougth a screen protector cause mine was a bit used and the problem persist.

I don‚Äôt know about you guys but in the past 2-3 weeks I only matched up with decent primos in gem grab who always retreated when they had 10 gems.
---
Dynamike looks like he already accepted his team's fate
---
What are you talking about
---
Yes, all bot matches are client sided so I can test these things in there.
---
And doing bot matches is not possible in the app on your phone right?
---
Gene has a fair shot since he can range them and once super is built it‚Äôs over. 
---
Colt too depending on obstacles. Rico can and with bouncing balls can likely get them behind cover.  Crow can usually get to a thrower without dying and make short work of them. 
---
In your scenario letting the clock run out may be a good strategy because if my first pick was Brock and you had say Barley, but I know my next brawler is Shelly don‚Äôt - I wanna face Barley with Shelly. 
---
There‚Äôs maps now that favor throwers, just like now but on this current map there‚Äôs nowhere for throwers to really hide without being cornered. Inside The barrier is the entire arena. 
---
The point is matchups will suck sometimes but hopefully you planned for air by bringing a counter to their guy.
---
I got Crow around 800 trophies, then 2 days later I got Tara

Same, but whenever a rogue primo pulls this, a part of me withers away just a little bit

I think it would be okay, because skilled enough players would be able to dodge it enough, and low skill crows would 1) most likely not have the star power and 2) not play crow correctly

Forgive the sideways video, but watch the analog stick while I‚Äôm moving. At one point I‚Äôm holding down and Penny actually moonwalks the opposite direction. This is NOT lag or a slow phone (I have an iPhone X). This is NOT a dirty screen or oily fingers. This is some sort of bug. Can anyone tell me wtf is going on here? Anyone else have this GAME BREAKING problem? Supercell, please help me!

Everyone gangsta until Piper starts hitting her shots

Do you mean Brawl News?

Hol up something ain‚Äôt right
---
- Can most most brawlers on 1vs1
---
- his super is almost impossible to counter
---
- extreme fast movement speed (the 2nd fastest in the game)
---
- very long range to poke on enemies
---
- all that with a decent HP (more than crow although they are both assassins)
---
No surprise he has the most trophies brawler on global AND competitive battles.

Yes, it may be necessary to improve the health of the elite bees to 2500, but in General for the small is not given a reward, but they will be very interfere, for example, you have little health, but since the bees fly faster than the player and appear often, then they will have to shoot, but because of this you can not be healed, so that bees

Why do people want a Bo remodel so bad?
---
I might create them some time in the future. [I've already created 3 subs to restore balance.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SubsIFellFor/comments/b83x53/i_fell_for_this/ejvt7ct)
---
Cool
---
Too bad you couldn't play him in his golden age. I heard that when Crow was the OP brawler the game was a literal nightmare.
---
Bird is the word
---
It's been deleted, so I'm guessing he accidentally shared something he wasn't supposed to and got a message from Supercell to take it down.  Time traveler confirmed then?
---
Tara doesn't need a remodeling shevneeds skins!
---
what?
---
Tbh, i wont mind hes missing
---
If your on Desktop, go onto the Brawl Stars Community home page. Below the description of the sub, there will be an option "Community Options". Click on it. There will then a Flair option. Click on it.

Honestly, the Bo you made looks better than the one is Brawl Stars.

Spike seems irrelevant there..

My GF got spike &amp; leon at 1200, she didn't even understand how rare they were

Wow ur spike is power 1 at 300 trophies

Really if they made his star power his normal speed‚Äôs and replaced his star power that might be for the better

Hope supercell experiments this before doing so though

really im intrested; ive only ever fought them and they do the same thing over and over again thats why i call them brain dead i had one time i played and predicted him three times with brock but he still creamed me by getting close still dont know he didnt die to this day.
---
Looks brutal
---
Very noice very violent spin
---
What‚Äôs funny is we could have easily won even he didn‚Äôt pull this shit. 
---
He‚Äôs already getting carried considering he has only 3k trophies. God this is so annoying. I pray that some mods see this.
---
Mortis...
---
For real, the only (accidental) 1-tile gap in the whole game is in EotS (also is an irrelevant position, likely to be fixed in the next update). The rest of maps don't have them, and the ones which had them (Cavern Churn, Rockwall Brawl and few other maps) were reworked not to have them, and all destructive supers don't generate 1-tile gaps anymore. It is this way because it's hard to move into them with the joystick.
---
brain dead or skilled?
---
Thanks
---
Thank you, hopefully I do
---
I guess Sakura spike has shorts too
---
Lol maybe :)
---
Sup
---
Thank you
---
Nah I didn‚Äôt get any legendaries and I‚Äôm at 8.3k. Plus I only got one mythic;_;
---
Dance till you die frank
---
Hey Sakura spike is goodüò§
---
I went back to CR because BR needs some fucking surgery to make it a fun, playable experience.
---
At least 2v2s in CR are still fun?
---
Stay the fuck away from pam
---
Yes I am :)
---
Jokes reveal what the joker is really thinking.
---
You dont understand how unfair this could be
---
Eye looks like supercell is not gonna fix anything and not an update also end of the game(sry I was crazy)
---
What the fuck have you broight upon this cursed land?
---
Leon isn't that easy to play, you gotta poke people to get your super and it takes quite a while, you have to avoid getting in risky situations and if you do the wrong thing like go against the wrong brawler, it gets bad for you. It's kinda like Frank in terms of getting the super and being good with it.
---
The record is 17 seconds
---
I subscribed you channel
---
Oh thx for telling me!
---
I know.
---
huh i guess i might be wrong then ive only ever fought leon and they just seem to do the same dumb things

3 Crows teaming is worse than 9 pams teaming

Use right brawlers for a map, if you don't know which are good on which maps instal brawl stats for brawl stars

Well say so, you couls fool people. Congrats to him anyway

im top left i got bo i just did not use him
---
Ehm.. excuse me?  I dont get it
---
Sometimes I'll start a match getting immediately targeted by 5 meteors one after the other.  Makes it so I can't even get a damn trophy, nothing.  And the beginning of showdown are very hectic and dependent on establishing a power advantage or controlling a certain area.  When you getting targeted immediately it can basically be a free kill to the enemy and guarantee you were losing 6 trophies.  They shouldn't be targeting one after the other period.
---
You‚Äôre very lucky then
---
We aren‚Äôt being rude. Two of them had slightly higher trophies and the piper had very low trophies, which balances it out. Not every game is going to be people at exactly your trophies, and you just need to come to expect that.
---
I was joking and its just because there a pipper as a the star player
---
Jesus
---
Me neither
---
Brah, if ya watched Tom &amp; Jerry you‚Äôre a real G
---
I see 8 tho
---
I'm chill now maybe 30 trophies a day I'm super busy
---
Double Leons are better
---
I can relate it happens a lot to me lately to lost that amount of trophies for one brawler ü•∫ü•∫
---
Which brawler did you play for Gem grab and Brawl ball ?
---
Watch KairosTime video on youtube about the best brawler per game mode. 
---
He consulted other pros to fine tune the ranking and it will help you to know which brawler to pick for each game.
---
Then it depends on which brawlers you have and whether they have they star power.
---
The video is available in the game in the news menu on the right but here is the link:

[Tier list V10]

---
Hope this helps.
---
Wtf man? What kind of crappy selfish reasoning is this?
---
Nice.
---
I think we should just add more damage to both :)
---
There should be ‚Äú16-15, 10 seconds left, but all my teammates were going suicidal instead of retreating.‚Äù
---
Yes, and that is fair, you are absolutely right, but this is what caps are for, and the game will end sooner the faster one team is overpowered  preventing people from gaining an absurd amount of trophies.
---
This is amazing. I want a Sakura Spike so badly!
---
Huge Chomnker
---
This man is good enough to join Supercell
---
Wait, what you said was clear, just agreeing with you that's all. But the reason I made my first comment and I'm angry about everyone associating dynamike with teaming and mortis with stopthespin is because I was playing dynamike just for my star token and I decided not to team. But these three mortis's a brock, and a frank decided to team on me and I couldn't do much. I was actually able to get away with low health but this el primo that was teaming with another el primo decided to jump on me and they all teamed in the end. They needed seven people to defeat one me.
---
I can relate
---
New brawl mew and mewtwo
---
Thanks alot
---
Meatiers are awesome just stand by walls you want to be gone
---
Buff Supercell logic
---
How about giving me crow
---
r/brawlmaps
---
Well maybe at the time that he saw the comment, it wasn't at the top?
---
The map is not complete if you see
---
It wasnt painful or anything, just maybe an hour or two of pushing from 340 to 500
---
Reminds me of the Gourmet from Tokyo Ghoul
---
Well we don‚Äôt know. Because Supercell changes there style of games
---
Yep lmao
---
Thats cute
---
Fiora?
---
Got some complaints so I updated the imaging as better as I could (to my ability)
---
Yes different loading screen just like Skullgirls
---
CrOw DoNt NeEd a BuFf!!!!!!!!
---
Agree
---
Are you the one with crow at 2k trophies
---
Didn't they nerf him by extending the detection range?
---
Gonna make a video on that later   :)

I ran into someone in showdown who had 10,000 trophies but was tanking matches with his max Shelly and died first on purpose in the two matches I had with him, he never fired back, and he had worked his way down to 200 by the time I examined the battle logs.

P.S. made by Kairostime

Obviously pam and jessie are getting a nerf. Crow will probably not get anything because popular to popular misconception hes not weak.
---
‚ÄúInsanely talented artist‚Äù yeah those this-took-me-69-years artists are really talented XD but really I think supercell like gifted the gems they were supposed to get in secret or smth and every 2 weeks or smth put up the winning covers on the facebook page
---
I have all brawlers except the legendaries and I didn‚Äôt pay any money for brawl boxes or buy any brawlers from shop
---
why??? all this for some upvotes...
---
Me playing siege for that last star token
---
why?? all this for some upvotes.
---
His left hand is inverted? Looks really cool tho
---
There were also scrapped brawlers that never saw the light of day.
---
I can‚Äôt fully express with words how true this is and how much frustration it has caused me
---
Ok
---
Shelly on bounty
---
Then you got lucky. That has nothing do with skill and everything to do with chance.
---
Chill bro it‚Äôs just 2 trophies... At least better than me losing 50 trophies yesterday because of siege
---
I hate telling them no so I do
---
It would be cool if the loading screen depended on which brawler you were playing as, and you get to choose which screen for that brawler
---
I miss that tutorial and everything that there was
---
Lol that would be rlly sad, is this real?
---
White crow should be 30 gems. Unless its getting a remodel
---
That isn't that good. I think you should try to save up for when a legendary or a mythic comes along.
---
And Snake
---
Don't you mean right wing? üòÇ
---
Its the angle
---
I dont experience lag. Improve your connection
---
Ok so him getting crow is not impressive at all and is chance therefore 7k is unimpressive
---
Oh my gosh! that looks so fancy, and well drawn! that monocle kinda fits Rico too! I like the gun idea.
---
It's really creative!
---
Play long range brawlers and dont stop moving for anything.
---
Who said anything about him getting crow? And no 7k on a f2p account is impressive that‚Äôs why youtubers do videos where they don‚Äôt pay.
---
I was thinking that they could add 25 or 30 every once in a while
---
This image hurts in so many levels... (Even if it is photoshopped, a glitch or something)
---
Not enough mortis
---
So true lmfao. Like I would be running around trying to find people and as soon as I find one I lose it.

Don‚Äôt get it, can someone explain?
