Started playing casually last week. I'm at 2.5k trophies now and I'm actually feeling something is off.
---

---
I don't know what do people exactly mean with bad MM but this is my experience:
---
- MM based on single brawler trophies, but I think there's more to that, maybe do global trophies count too?
---
- I'm always the least powered up brawler. Maybe it's because I've started recently and struggling to get money to power up brawlers. I have like three at level 5 and the rest 3-4. I get opponents wjth brawlers at level 7-8 everytime.
---
- The game seems to have something scripted about making you lose. I'm an average player and as average I expect to have a win rate around 50%. Well, if I win a lot during one day, as soon as I quit and play after a few hours, I lose like 9/10 matches. This means at the end of the day my win rate is still around 50%, I gain trophies but my losing and winning gets consistent for hours.
---
Today I did 24 matches and lost 22. I swear I was playing decently. The opponents were just too good and always level 7/8.
---
Don't know if this is what makes MM bad of if there's more, since I'm new.
---
Can anyone confirm/add more to this? I"d like to understand more.
---
---
---
HA! I get it.
---
Pam was never thicc, she was just fat... this was probably when she was jessie‚Äôs height
---
Oh no üòÇ

YouTube is a better place for guides than Reddit

I love pewdiepie submissions

Nice lvl-rank. Most people have rank 15 level 7-8 and it pisses me

Ok

Actually it's not but it's maybe similar

You got me ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Darryl- Only useful with star power.
---
And then come 5th and get 1 trophy
---
lol do a colt documentary 
---
For people who don‚Äôt get it: this is another Leon invis joke
---
And skate 4
---
Perpetually woke
---
I like this a lot, could be super frustrating with a quick team wipe and they get a score tho. I‚Äôd love to see some kind of CTF variant.
---
I quit the game long ago, but I know they added lots of cards since then
---
What rank is your darryl? In higher ranks he‚Äôs pretty bad... you probably only got kills cuz the leon didn‚Äôt see you and you killed ‚Äúweak‚Äù brawlers in close range like barley and brock

I agree

Lol I never tilted that bad my worst tilt ever was like 50 trophies 
---
Thank you!!
---
Too op
---
Idk what to do man every enemy team has like 4-5 levels superiority in total
---
I love this
---
Wow, I never thought I'd see a clown concept. Looks pretty nice if I say so myself. :D

No. Awful idea, he doesn't need a buff
---

---
You clearly don't know how this works
---
i dOn't LIkE WhERe thIs iS goInG
---
Just a "fun" video.. Kind of got addicted to this game really quickly and ended up getting pressured into whaling from my chat on stream. If you guys are thinking about spending money on the game, maybe this will help you make your decision to either spend or not spend? Anyway, love you guys :P
---
So satisfying to watch after having been killed a few times by teaming mikes today
---
1-((1-x)^y) is your chance to get a new Brawler
---
X is your drop rate
---
Y is boxes to open (for example from 20 box you have z chance to get a Legendary)
---
This formule is confirmed by Frank Supercell's owner i asked a question to him from Twitter he answered me with an article about chance algorithms and i found this formule from there.
---
the role suits him well, a short yet powerful commander.
---
10/10
---
Not sure how much you've played. But I've seen spinning used as celebration, giving up, and teaming. It's a form of communication. In this game, he's spinning because he's done trying.
---
r/oddlysatisfying 
---
thanks
---
I think this means February 
---
Cuz he is a clown, maybe?
---
Clowns do jokes, right?
---
THANK YOUUU 
---
I've been (surprisingly) waiting for this!
---
I love the art, I feel like the special is a good idea but without a distance closer a big slow tank will fall off quickly at higher elos. A little tweaking could make it work though. Like instead of increasing your damage, each successful monkey atk could result in the monkey latching on and slowing down the target a percent, making it easy for you to catch up and lay the smack down. 
---
Max Shelly only spamming super button?
---
If u saw his other posts....
---
This is the Darryl Brawlers see when he's on energy drink and his super is ready.  
---
Awesome art!
---
Yeaaaah boiiii r34
---
i guess im supposed to look at somebodys profile before commenting 
---
Bull should just be a literal bull or taurus costume
---
Probably making changes to it
---
They trash lmao
---
*When you have no power ups but people still team up on you*
---
No way, Bo &amp; Shelly. With vision a base Shelly can easily kill a base bull of the same level (or even higher) if she gets the first shot off and supers immediately after the third shot. 
---
I thought he was trying to say the creator was stupid or something.
---
Did you paint this?
---
His super is he curls up into an egg and rolls around
---
The cool factor around his super are these two things
---
If the ground if too hot, the egg will break and Darryl will turn to yolk and die (when Darryl dies, elixir will not splash it will be yolk)
---
Darryl never stops rolling until the ground gets hot
---
You go to the brawl stars reddit page and click the menu. There it will ask you if you want to pick a flair. Then you can pick ur brawler. Hope that helps.

Sssshhhhh. Don‚Äôt tell him.
---
All u gotta do is train your muscle memory and you can easily visual where they‚Äôre gonna go. There‚Äôs usually no more than 2 paths to go so I just take the two side points and throw an extra in the middle for good measure.

Please include piper in the next one, they're annoying af

Been getting fat chests lately, just opened a big box with almost 200 coins in it...

I guess colt and poco followed by crow

It's a joke.

LETS BOOST YOUR KARMA
---
He is talking about the angry robo modifier. 
---
LoL
---
Ya that sucked lol. Remember when it took mortis 5 shots to kill a dynamike 
---
Ask jessie. She works at wendy's and could give you a discount 
---
Hmm
---
Same. I usually only play showdown, and i HATE Cavern Churn, soooo No Brawl Stars for today
---
he has really low stats, and star power is the only thing which makes him usable
---
Not saying you're right but not saying that you're wrong 
---
I'm glad you agree on most of the things I mentioned! Someone else also said Star player was based on objective so I edited my post. As for emotes, I suppose so. But sometimes I just wanna tell random that they need to stay back when they have all the gems or something. Gamemodes I just want a solo one, at least in Feb-March if they're gonna make one.

I think they got it at that last second cause my man had full health will like 3 seconds left

Yup. Although it was WAY MUCH better for my phone. Also Happy cake day!!
---
check bushes for bull or shelly super, ur good to go...
---
Just 15 more minutes 
---
So, Leon. 
---
cake day? bs cake day?

Yep, very surprising to me as well when I started playing for android. They improved on a lot like shelly, Nita, bull, etc but some are controversial.

I ship it lol
---
You're playing darryl wrong if you think you can just run at them or super at them and try to burst them down at point-blank. Darryl isn't bull, he's an more of an assassin.
---
Colt had the most derpy smile lmfao. But it's a nice idea!
---
I hate Dynamikes. The most infuriating thing in showdown. I keep on running but I know I won‚Äôt get away 
---
Well... For you! It's suposed to be your birthday! Unless you didn't give your true brithday date
---
oh rit, its not my real birthday , anyway thnx for replying
---
Yea but it also makes him op for everyone with star power but trash for everyone without his star power
---
I use penny everytime in skull creek. I have got lots of trophies. Mortar destroys those throwers. But if you can't get them in the beginning, it will be hard to save the mortar. 
---
A good balance character is good with star and still usable without
---
maybe decreasing his vision by a bit and increasing his damage per arrow will be good. his super is pretty good..
---
Or once he has 10 gems, he can't retreat to the spawn, ge keeps on fighting until he dies.
---
I think it would be better if the star was always above your head (if you got it), meaning you can't hide in bushes or disappear off the face of the earth with Leon.  Sounds fun.  Pam and leon would excel, as well as other brawlers (depending on the map's choke points and openess)  
---
It would also be fun to see this in a duo's format, with you and a buddy against 2 other duos.  This would lead to less of a camping strategy and more to a run for your life.( if for duos you may need to lessen the speed nerf)
---
Make it that the way she shots the orbs is bass on the attack joystick dingy
---
So If it's far from the centre the orbs will shot far from each other while close to the centre it will shot very close to each other
---
I think you pushed the iron bit too hard at top and right side.......
---
Awesome job tho!üëèüëèüëè
---
Don‚Äôt @ me
---
Huh. I feel bad for those ipads/phones more than the kids, not everyone realises the value of an apple product.
---
That's supposed to happen just keep typing
---
idk how people liked these models
---
Like, look at nita or mortis, oh my lord
---
No shame dying against leon.  
---
Probably the best way to die. Who is ever going to say, "HA, you suck, you lost to a double Leon?".  It would be bad if you weren't a thrower and lost to Mortis or bo.
---
Yea those mentally restarted players are the worst
---
I hollered cause I'm real black Tahaaaaaaa
---
No irony here
---
I can see a max dynamite being annoying when he attacks the safe
---
Basicly jumping over the fence repeatedly while attacking the safe up close
---
This is genius 
---
I see nothing wrong with that
---
[removed]
---
Echo Chamber is Bo's waifu. He can abuse the hell out of the choke points with his super.
---
we need someone to voice this

Good job bb

I think we should buff Leon

We do.

‚ÄúTravels in packs‚Äù I‚Äôm done lmao

I got mine like before 1k

But i have 11k?

Am i the only one who doesnt get this?

Fair enough I guess

this gave me chills.

please don‚Äôt stop making this incredible art. I love it so much.
---
Is this really a thing for the rates?
---
Wow man you must have a lot of time on your hands üëÄ
---
Congrats, you spent an extra 12 hours playing a mobile game rather than actually doing something useful, just to boast about how you got carried to a high trophy count. Please, teach me how to lower myself so far down. 
---
Lol
---
What app do you use for this?
---
I'VE GOT A SHORT FUSE!
---
I think to stop it we could disconnect users who spin over three circles, like idle disconnect.
---
And you deserve it! Nice job!
---
This game nothing like arrow io. Have you even played that game??? Also, Fortnite came after brawl stars (And in the soft launch this game was nothing like fortnite) 
---
It should be &lt;/c&gt; not &lt;/C&gt;

‚ÄúGood old times portrait was so much better‚Äù

Jumping over jumbo bots

shelly bitch
---
Bo would not be op in this map
---
Was that actually my issue?
---
Good job. Btw this is the probability to find *at least* a legendary in x boxes, assuming legendaries are unlimited over boxes. I don't know how they cut off the chances of P\[**X** \&gt;= 3\] where **X** is the random variable. Your's a cool approximation tho.

OMG ARE U FRIKKIN STUPID???? SHELLY NEEDS A GOOD ULT BECAUSE BULL IS BETTER IN EVERY WAY. HE HAS HIGHER HEALTH, DAMAGE, RELOAD, SHOT SPEED EVEYTHING EXCEPT A GOOD SUPER.if you take away shellys super, shelly doesnt need to exist because bull is better in every way. And its not like shelly is op its just that NOOBS LIKE TO USE BULL ALL THE TIME AND YOU WHINE ABOUT GETTING KILLED BY SHELLYS SUPER BECAUSE YOU ARE TOO DUMB TO KEEP YOUR DISTANCE
---
Leon for Smash
---
I know, they usually want to have one of their friends to help them out.
---
ƒ∞s this real?
---
What was Poco supposed to be like 
---
I think this question is more appropriate to ask you. I'm just here for art.
---
More importantly, thank super cell because you got a spike before you even collected all super rares 
---
True
---
Well yes, I got it a 400 throphies.
---
My luck.
---
No,random legendary brawler offers dont exist. And thats not how the other random rarity brawler offers work either, you dont buy one and get another offer of a higher rarity immediately. 
---
Legendary brawlers in offers are already determined in offers so no randomness and they cost 549 each
---
Alright, since it‚Äôs so hard to understand such an obvious thing and read between the lines here you go. Supers aren‚Äôt necessarily something that you can just waste on destroying terrain, especially in a map where 80% of the time you won‚Äôt even have clear vision of other enemies to be able to even charge up your super. Not all characters have supers that destroy terrain, meaning that they don‚Äôt even have that advantage of being able to do that. Is that clear now?
---
H I
---
That‚Äôs not my point. You don‚Äôt just stop playing the game because you get matched against Leon who is unbalanced right? I‚Äôm talking about balance here
---
Can you tell me my legendary chance ? My % is 0.1344.
---
And somehow when I use him I always feel either how op he is or how shit he is. Considering sometimes you hit everything and sometimes nothing
---
üòÇ
---
Um what? 
---
r/gifsthatenetoosoon
---
My highest rarity brawler right now, at almost 5000, is Frank. And my only Epic brawler.
---
*cool*
---
Can i ask how much is your total trophies??? 
---
Then we shall see if your opinion matters, though i highly doubt that since you are complaining that shellys super needs a nerf wait lemme guess your total trophies is 500, you main bull cuz you are an idiot, you never play any other brawler ever cuz u think bull is op and you whine about shelly needing a nerf being bulls main counter. I can see that happening. But of course i shall never know what your true amount of trophies is as you may very likely lie to me to boost your own self esteem thinking that your opinion is always correct.
---
T H I C C B O U N C Y B O I
---
Look at the new dyna tho
---
I'd personally not buy any of these except dyna.
---
.
---
Where u been for the last 2 weeks dawg 
---
So you don't like to use auto aim?
---
Chief Pat must be having a bad day.
---
Hmmm
---
And may i also add that in bushy mapps ( feast or famine, cavern churn etc) bull and shelly are likely to flock to the middle, and how ON EARTH do you expect bull not to be at point blank range when a shelly and a bull meet. Have you ever thought about that when you said " shelly can do damage at a range while bull needs to be up close to do maximum damage"
---
Master Droidekkas!!!
---
id like to play it no joke 
---
Master Destroyers!
---
Shellys super cannot one shot ANY BRAWLER, its the fact that her super stuns enemies and she gets a chance to shoot them one or two more times that makes her " one shot any brawler"
---
It‚Äôs real, I was the joystick 
---
He won no trophies and everyone has their star power without the level 9 stats so yes.
---
Its 4000
---
My bull is rank 18 but I don't play him anymore
---
I'm 17
---
showdown is still viable if you can consistantly get top 3's. I personally mostly play 3v3s but once in a while duo showdown is still kinda fun and is def a way to gain trophies. dont recommend solo tho
---
Well done not getting harassed to death by the bulls
---
It's been like 3 days cmon 
---
No way you have no super rares
---
IKR 
---
i dont see anything wym
---
I do think showdown is fun, don't get me wrong. But when you can lose over 30 trophies in only 60 seconds worth if being in showdown, something needs to be changed.
---
whats the song?
---
That looks like a fun heist game there aren‚Äôt many of those
---
wdym. the max amount of trophies most people will lose is roughly 7 if you get rank 10. still kinda sucks tho
---
the piper super took down the last 1% of health it was epic
---
I know so bad
---
Lmao this is good shit right here
---
I'm talking about how quick or long a shiwdown match can be. It only takes roughly 20 seconds to get 10th or 9th, but up to 4 minutes to snag 1st. I'm just gonna avoid the chaos in between.
---
You literally used the clash Royale image ü§£. Great idea, some people have posted more brake stars themed ones, check top of all time
---
Ok, these are pictures, not 3D models.
---
Okey, i will play every character equally until 300 trophy then i can keep leveling and playing to one or two characters that i liked the most. Thanks for the advice.
---
yes
---
Those hand remember me of someone
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Nooooo pls dont do that. Thats a mistake all beginners do, you should play all brawlers equally to get more experienced rather than maining one brawler. Btw this affects many other high trophy players as people who main one brawler, ( shelly, bull , el primo etc) play 3v3 gamemodes too thus ruining their team because they have one high trophy brawler but they are still a beginner therefore less experienced and they dont know game mechanics very well. For example me a 8k total trophy player, when i play gem grab to collect the star token i almost always get paired up with a low leveled player who mains shelly because of our individual brawler trophies and they suck at the game due to lack of experience therefore we lose and i rage becuz of their ignorance
---
If you frequent the sub at all, you‚Äôd know you aren‚Äôt
---
ReEeeEEe
---
And?
---
thx!
---
Pretty drawing of pretty piper
---
Imagine this scenario: you‚Äôre playing Brawl Stars and you die. No big deal, you can respawn. But as soon as you respawn, the entire enemy team runs over to the spawn point and kills you in a few seconds. This happens several times in a row 
---
Yea the problem with brock is that you have to aim yourselfe with him, so autoaim is useless /s
---
Thank you, science side of reddit. Take this upvote of mine
---
Yea
---
Not really. I can imagine all maxed Bo making teams, lol
---
Because the enemy gets more gems than you.
---
Obviously you don‚Äôt kill everything, or take every gem.
---
*for the price of 10 boxes

---
üòÇ I‚Äôm too stupid to be able to get an answer from this formula 
---
SiN dOlOr, No HaY gLoRiA
---
You have to put some $$$ into this game and you'll get a legendary
---
WOW!! I LOVE IT 
---
That could be possible I think
---
He said it‚Äôs a risk. Not a choice, a risk.
---
Unless he edited his comment
---
amazing
---
A chess board is 64x64, literally unwatchable fan art
---
U wanna try n get 16.5K with a 1K leon?
---
Oh wow
---
5300 is such an arbitrary number. Personally don‚Äôt see why that needs changing as it‚Äôs not a landmark. 
---
Darude rapestorm
---
Ye a officer this comment right here
---
I saw some posts with mythic/epic/super rare brawlers as shop offers. As I don't have mythics, I wonder why I didn't get one in the shop then.
---
You definitely can't say that about all of them. Coach Cory and Kairos are both pretty solid. Cory has won some tournaments iirc 
---
Nah caps infinite pretty sure. Most just stop at 1K bc mm takes 10 minutes
---
That's from your phone... You need to change phone ASAP. Lol
---
I think they are joking
---
you shoot them?
---
The last update was 40 days ago so it's not dead an updated coming soon
---
Not the best post here
---
I got my first mythic at 7800. Had only epic superrares etc. Just wait it's gonna pop of ur brawlbox soon.
---
It just isn't enough at that level is all. I feel like it should at least be a big box.
---
Nice Landi! ppl gonna hate bc it‚Äôs leon but 1K is still insane, especially while getting 16.5K (prolly more) total the same season
---
Every game mod is viable
---
Yeah I think they just took it on another level with brawl stars with this luck thing 
---
Nah,look at them,some of them say that they like it because do the controls and some say that brawl stars is incompatible on Thier device but they don't care because this is much better,and I'm quoting 5star reviews here
---
~You're goddamn right!~
---
I believe it. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs final though. 
---
Is he a level 1? üòâ Congrats 
---
Yeah but for a 1K push only gem and heist prolly. 10 min mm and u lose 7 gain 2, so u can‚Äôt afford to lose like at all.
---
Omg it‚Äôs the two who knock 
---
What a specific statistic to pull out.
---
If you know you‚Äôre gonna have connection problems, find a better location to play at. Or just don‚Äôt keep trying at the same location. A lot of my house doesn‚Äôt receive our Wi-Fi well, so I have to play in the living room next to the router. 
---
Your situation is worse, but I‚Äôm sure you can find *somewhere* to play without ruining the game for your teammates.
---
Anti Team map
---
I got an Epic and they did drop my chances.
---
You definitely can't say that about all of them. Coach Cory and Kairos are both pretty solid. Cory has won some tournaments iirc
---
Congo!!!!This BRAWLER made it!!He's in the community round table video!
---
Restart your app when that happens
---
I'M MIKE
---
Sure, draw it on Bull. I'm sure it'd look satisfying. 
---
It's terrible. I have no idea why they don't matchmake based on total trophies.
---
Read the first one and already deserves an upvote
---
Yea what?
---
Why blur the names???
---
Its impossible to ask for friend request if you havent played whit someone or know is contact
---
From my experience, when I use Frank I almost always am able to kill a Bull that spawns next to me. We both go after a Cube, and I somehow manage to hit the Bull all three times, I chase him, I use my super, and boom. Dead.
---
A friend of mine calls him ricojet

Stop spamming

You think the lag issue is a problem?  If they add replays then it will make everything worse.  Let them fix lag first.
---
Genie brawler ? Hows that ? A brawler that have magic or something like that ?
---
u dont need to subscribe to see this tho. and replays are already done they can turn them on at anytime, they are making sure the servers can handle them.

Imagine the ulti

Thank you for your input! I actually completely missed this part and forgot my formula only calculated for the chance you end at without taking account the changes along the way. It is still roughly the same however and will only really affect it if you are calculating for hundreds or thousands of boxes. That said, I will still try to come up with an improved formula and edit it into the post. 
---
What are the skins?
---
Pirates of caraibe in brawl stars...that would be so cool !
---
No one buys boxes it's not worth it, you buy token doublers, so you'll get 1000 tokens for 50 gems so 50 gems = 10 boxes
---
Ok now this is nice!
---
Damn son. Almost makes you feel ashamed lol
---
Finally! some love for darryl ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Your ancestors are proud!
---
no
---
How is this not removed? This Isnt even related to brawl stars
---
Awesome roundtable!!! 
---
Here's the possibile brawler he's talking about:
---
&gt;**Jinn**  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Lore: A Djinn, or Jinn, is pretty much an evil Genie. This brawler is based off that, but incorporated more into a ninja character.  
---
&gt;Description: *Jinn is a skillful ninja warrior who traveled from far across seas. Landing in the Wild West, he now teleports all over the place looking for a way home.*  
---
&gt;Appearance: He looks likes a dude from Aladdin, except fully clothed in red and and black, with eye holes. He carries two ninja swords.  
---
&gt;Rarity: Common Health: 500 Movement Speed: Fast (same as mortis or crow)  
---
&gt;Main: Hide n‚Äô Seek  
---
&gt;His has a range of about Dynamike‚Äôs or Barely‚Äôs. Wherever you click within your range, Jinn teleports there. He spins around, disappearing into the air and dealing 150 damage to anyone immediately adjacent to him. Wherever you clicked he then appears there, spinning around and dealing another 150 damage. If you click on where Jinn already is, he can deal a total of 300 damage. Reload time of 2.4 seconds.  
---
&gt;Super: Area of Denial  
---
&gt;Jinn throws out 3 smoke grenades onto the ground that all explode into a cloud of red smoke immediately upon impact. Each grenade has a 6 x 6 smoke diameter, but since they are all near each other most of this area is overlapping. You and your teammates can see through the red smoke easily (it is transparent) but the enemy team can not see anything inside of it at all.  
---
&gt;Strategies: Jinn is an assassin and support card. With his low health, he shouldn‚Äôt be in the middle of a battle. He should move around the side of the map picking off at enemies while teleporting around to charge his super. His super is great to be used on the gem mine or safe. He isn‚Äôt very effective in Bounty or Showdown.
---
At 9150 you'll get 50 coins and it's just not worth pushing for that
---
Looks like nix from brawlhalla while doing his side sig! 
---
Ya.
---
Thank you 
---
I do! 95% of the time
---
Damn thats sick!
---
‚ÄúMaxed dynamikes only‚Äù
---
Up
---
In game that would look pretty nice
---
Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, but I‚Äôm pretty sure mega boxes are like opening 10 brawl boxes in terms of chances of opening a new brawler, so if you plug them into this formula, just use the amount of mega boxes multiplied by 10 for x.
---
I was thinking, that might actually be the highest chance I've seen LUL
---
We need more of this! It‚Äôs too awesome! 
---
I'll take anything that gives me gems
---
Damn that's high
---
One of my favorite art ever... You are really talentedüòä
---
Also try to read that without Barley's voiceüòÇ
---
2019
---
Sounds simple yet very unique, would absolutely love this. 
---
Like in smash
---
totallu agree
---
Ooh, and we can have lvl 1 to 10!
---
Easy choise, more expensive ofc
---
which?
---
See my idea
---
Why Supercell didn't add subtitles? 
---
Oh god I laughed so hard at this
---
Traditionally they don‚Äôt give us all of the info before the release. Like the big one last year before the global release. 
---
We know that 3 other brawlers that aren‚Äôt codenamed Genie are in the game. 
---
-Some uzi-toting dude on a hover board who shoots a big bomb 
---
-A massive HP brawler codenamed Animal. A sort of paladin 
---
-A grappling hook guy
---
-Frank already said, Spike, Crow and Rico are getting full reworks like Bull and Barley did 
---
-Frank also said a complete rework of Brawl Ball is coming 
---
On top of that a possible Genie and new skins. So it‚Äôs overall great news
---
Here‚Äôs what I really want. As a pro player I want clans to be more active. We need clan wars and other reasons to make clans interesting. The social aspect of the game is lacking right now.  Clash Royale on the other hand has a massive social aspect. 
---
We could also do with star points for max accounts. Star points for gold even. Lol I‚Äôm sitting on 100k gold. 
---
Dont be that one kid who ruin everything 
---
Am I guaranteed a better epic if I pay more?
---
It was filmed last night. I edited it. It's not on their official channel. I only know two languages. English and Dork. Although I speak both fluently. 
---
Great comic!
---
They need to add a way to switch the music back. Like in the settings
---
Nah jk, dont buy, not worth, u will get epics eventually, save gems. for leggy offer
---
Thanks!
---
The in-game help and support page
---
Shh now they‚Äôll know 
---
he should change his name to Kent3D
---
Not a horrible idea, I agree.
---
The wooden handle could use more grittiness 
---
not interesting, one way in and out
---
I mean...im only 15 myself

u/Ryan_Supercell trying to be Coach Cory ü§îüò≤ huh.. I see....

Lmao

but i do it on randoms because i have no friends to played with.
---
Ikr can they like stop snitching
---
That sketch man, it looks nice! As far as the zap goes, what does this ‚Äúzap‚Äù do? 
---
A little over a year. Still not maxed since I just got Leon a few weeks ago lol. 
---
im excited for new Aladdin movie.
---
No he's not. Y'all are the ones that are basically breaking the rules and call the people out who don't??
---
These types of content is the reason why am I subscribed to this Subreddit.
---
Oh no
---
Looks really clean owo
---
Hey Lex! I‚Äôve participated in all 5 round tables, thank you. I love them all even if I have posts that do not make it. I do wish that you would‚Äôve went into the primary reason for my post which was that at the top of ladder, you should play each other, though. 
---
Laughs in *400+ trophies brawler*
---
only normies use plebbit
---
Uh... Beep Beep Lettuce? 
---
How can you automate a way to spot teaming tho?
---
I do!!üòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅ
---
You‚Äôre wrong
---
Lmao, deleted
---
Also, what‚Äôs the cool down on the super? In addition, can projectiles pass through his Super? Only the brawlers cannot go through or nothing can go through?
---
Did you play exceptionally well?
---
Even in English it would have been helpful, but I understand that only a short time has passed.
---
Thanks for the comment. Unfortunately due to the length we had to shorten almost every comment (and the vid still clocked in at 25 minutes) but your point was seen by us and it's a salient one. Thanks for participating!
---
I care because I lose trophies.
---
Not saying im part of this meme war or whatever it called just let people have their fun it the internet after all 
---
Nope, you just didn‚Äôt collect all the tokens.
---
Matchmaking fixes?
---
you‚Äòll get him at 3000 trophies...
---
There is a picture that I have of the animal one. Keeps getting taken down though.
---
Fun fact: Snake Prairie was once a Gem Grab map too
---
The fact you said ‚Äúred Indian‚Äù is only mildly offensive to some people
---
Okay thanks for the answer but I want to get better
---
To be fair everyone teams. I got my Colt to 500 just by teaming in SD in one night. 
---
The way I see it is 60% of people team and the rest get picked off. Survival of the teamiest I guess. If you have a ‚Äúnon-threatening‚Äù brawler like Colt, Crow, Jessie, Pam and the throwers it‚Äôs easy. But anyone of the one shot ponies no one wants you. And Mortis lol. Don‚Äôt SD with Mortis. 
---
Weird flex but ok
---
New Brawlers confirmed! (Genie Brawler) 15.22 at this video!
---
Not enough bushes
---
I just use Leon and Spike to help friends because even if I lose 60 trophies I get them back on SD afterwards. And Bull on heist. We all have our favourites. 
---
We need more quests. Like in Blizzard‚Äôs Diablo 3. We need more end game content. Currently it‚Äôs not fun after 500 unless you have a very good team with you and you use your favourite brawlers. And even then it‚Äôs grind time. 
---
Let's be honest, Nita skin is nice. Penny and dynamike are decent though
---
It might if your player is hiding in bushes that are in the corner of the battlefield where the pop-up and you‚Äôre trying to do something. Like I said. It would obscure the battlefield just for a pop-up. Gem Grab isn‚Äôt about who killed who. 
---
Good one
---
I miss Sensei Adam and his maths. What a maths wizard üßôüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 
---
These sound pretty ridiculous so I‚Äôm assuming that some, if not all are fake
---
Power 6 Bo at 527 trophies. üòé
---
Rub his lantern and see the wishes granted 
---
Yah, it will be interesting to see how matchmaking smoothens out when the new global players get to high trophies. But without end game content of just feels dry anyway and people get bored and move on to second accounts or just stop playing at these high trophies so you still get 500s vs 300s. 
---
I'm not sure I would agree that they are doing a great job... Everything seems cash grabby to me except the 3D map overhaul. Like I really lose respect for the team when they release an overpowered brawler that is legendary... That's the ultimate sell out. And the worst is they pretend like they're really working on it by releasing a nerf that doesn't really do anything and then not nerfing him more until 2-3 months pass. It just boils my blood.
---
Whatever, at this point I'm just hoping they get enough money from all this to hire more devs and designers and really take the game to a solid,  fleshed out level.
---
*A N G E R Y  N I T A*
---
Beard+Air pods. What has ryan become üòÇüòÇ
---
Okay they‚Äôre decent but nowhere close to as nice as non-seasonal.
---
Yeah. All concentrate on the middle section
---
A good strat is to super people into the poison. It deals way more dmg than you.
---
Did you make it or just cut two eye holes in a lunch box?
---
WHAM BAM HERE COMES PAM!
---
Owo he looking epic
---
Step 1: Play Anyone else than Bull/Shelly/El Primo
---
Step 2: Stay in a corner and watch everyone else killing each other
---
Step 3: Enjoy your free top 3
---
I made this 2 weeks ago it‚Äôs not original anymore 
---
Wow it‚Äôs going up to 1800??
---
Alright. Cool. Next up is the mega box 
---
Heck yeah it is!
---
On skins
---
Yeah it‚Äôs kind of nuts. I just fart around with low friends and when the sharks come on (which is rare as most are in school), we push hard for a few hours. So it‚Äôs like zombie mode all week just tootin around with Leon and Spike until the weekend 
---

The only time the netflix adaption is better than the anime and manga

cAN U NOT THIS IS MY LIFELINE AS PAM
---
Spike
---
Yeah, I'm so tired of utter trash in the shop, give me the box back!!! (It's just a nice way to start the day, as compared to new items in shop, oh it's just 4 Shelly points....)
---
Rip off of Destiny‚Äôs Trial of Osiris./s
---
Nah that actually sounds really fun. Supercell needs to add more to this game, their is so much potential.
---
Check the bushes
---
I made a post suggesting this too. Tough It was only me who wanted. https://preview.redd.it/hv65quci7p921.jpg?utm_source=reddit-android&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5fe4823314f8e15154b5fb72326b01bef6eab46a
---
I got a robo boner
---
With almost everyone getting buffed in HP and damage, is anything REALLY getting buffed? Won‚Äôt these changes cancel each other out? 
---
Lol link is broken
---
How is ur game so smooth? üòü
---
My brother got crow at 900 
---
I have only fRaNk (I write this from my brother's phone)
---
Saw it. Don't know why
---
How many trophies?
---
Fixed
---
It's still amazing how many people play this game but seem to have no idea what they are doing...
---
Don't even get me started on club members that think they know what they are doing yet still make countless mistakes then tell you to change your brawler... I'm almost more inclined to play with randoms... Almost
---
Repost
---
this was not a bug. High trophies players waited so long for their game so the system paired them  with u guys. It‚Äôs normal to have some games with much higher trophies brawlers than u 
---
Intresting thoughts mate! Thanks!
---
8.5k. playing from beta

Lol weird you did a mutch bettet job at editing

I'll consider it :B
---
Impact text seriously....
---
I live in egypt too lol
---
"Art" 
---
Pff just a rolling trashcan 
---
I never tell people to change their brawlers but I do say things like
---
"If they are all dead, push up and grab the gems instead of staying behind a wall throwing bombs" 
---
Especially when the ability is active with the star power
---
Send like a crossover of rockwall brawl and hot maze, I like it!
---
But these maps tho...
---
Yes, but you get the heal instantly, so you can't save skulls.
---
I play it once just to get the star key
---
Nice idea I would really like to have it in game
---
MY EYESü§Æü§Æü§Æü§Æ
---
Damn. All the best with that
---
Someone give this guy a platinum ‚ô• 
---
Well the star power is one of the best but consider how bad mortis is. He absolute üí©. Considering a lot of these power creeps you need to wait and see, this is meta changing and no one balance can be looked into until you see how their counter fares. For example primo doing more damage and shelley slowing longer will hurt mort a LOT, the star power might be just to balance that out, or it might be a buff. You need to wait and see. 
---
And yet you can't spend $20 dollars to actually play with him in the game... SMH 
---
I am surprised it took three supers to kill the el primos
---
Why is this??
---
I already made an attack, super, and Star Power in a separate post if that‚Äôs what u mean.
---
Bo‚Äôs super: gets nerfed
---
Bull noises
---
I guess Bull was watching JoJo
---
OMG üòç
---
WHERE IS THE CROW BUFF????? &gt;:( 
---
Oh. But i can relate. I am not from a developed country either. Hope it gets better:)
---
Np
---
Ahahaha
---
It looks strange to me
---
I have two potential answers:
---
1. A new brawler, the leaked one with shotgun, hook and CRAZY kickback (jump over walls)
---
2. A horrible Ricochet remodel
---
\#Notice
---
‚Ä¢ in-game news have more details than the video
---
All the changes 
---
Slightly bugged overall, but nerfed in the only gamemode he excels at.
---
That sucks:(
---
Top 10 saddest anime death) 
---
You're right
---
Alternative title
---
When there are 8 teamers in SD and the only other solo picks me off
---
Because it‚Äôs not really needed?
---
rico's remodel I think
---
imagine playing piper on this map
---
I rlly hope the first 
---
Unlike Clash Royale balance changes, where I hate 90% of the changes, I literally love all of these. Don‚Äôt know how I feel about barley, though. 
---
Also, max Darryl is going to be OP...
---
Barely. He‚Äôll still be top tier.
---
This boi
---
Fr don‚Äôt see what the big deal is especially if ur playing solo showdown 
---
Yeah but i think he will be way better at other gamemodes now.
---
Rico...What happened to you? Are you ok?
---
Ben t√ºrk√ºm de agaggsg
---
Multiple instances don‚Äôt stack anymore. Source: In-game patch notes.
---
yikes. TBH 8% isn't enough
---
Exactly wtf, so many buffs and one of the most underwhelming brawlers doesn‚Äôt get it...
---
I'm getting Cowboy Bebop vibes from this
---
400 gems
---
AKA Ricochet remodel.
---
He didn‚Äôt get a very large buff regarding his stats. So I don‚Äôt think he will be that much better but who knows
---
Looks like New Rico's model 
---
Thought they would've did 15%
---
What he said is that two of the suggested skins (in the comments of the roundtable on reddit) will be in the next update. He didn't say which ones, though. 
---
A YOUNG NITA‚ÄôS PHINE
---
Ohh well now he's ugly af
---
I'm pretty sure that's the Rico model rework
---
Bb got improved. No shit of putting the ball behind the goal
---
R.I.P Rico's hat....
---
Yeah, we hope he is better, but..
---
The barley buff goddammit
---
They need to stop killing brawlers. First Darryl, now Mortis and Barley
---
I might actually play that mode now
---
Who am I kidding, get Heist more often in the rotation pls
---
It got buffed. How rip?
---
Someone is gonna die tonight
---
Meaning he can dribble effectively once, with a small reload twice, where he used to dribble 3-4 times?? Yeah not killed
---
I visit it every time
---
His bottles no longer stack dmg 
---
They nerfed Barley‚Äôs super
---
If you look closely,Colt have a new model too (He have a belt)
---
I am pretty sure two brawlers doing circles and teaming on a brawler isn't that subtle
---
Propably because they feature him the most, they need him to look as good as possible.
---
Well this post aged well
---
I like it
---
You have no clue what you‚Äôre talking about
---
Hmmm a common chest
---
Yup
---
Did he lose his hat? Oh no - the hat thieves are back
---
Lmao and now mortis gets nerfed and passing the ball takes ammo bar, cool!!!!!!
---
Kinda like Darryl, though I‚Äôm exited to see how this small buff will affect
---
That‚Äôs why I play as Shelly: you are always solo. 
---
Didnt know ya have reddit
---
This went by so fast!
---
Did anyone else notice that brawler at the top? Is it a new one?
---
New brawler at 0.06 
---
His super damage doesn't stack anymore tho. Buff at long range, nerf at short range, making him less OP in Heist.
---
Friendly Battles
---
Crow :(
---
15 is the legal age in a lotta countries, e.g. the country I live in, Denmark
---
Yeah he‚Äôs one of my favourites to play. His stats just felt a little underwhelming 
---
You have no proof that they did this to push the higher level characters. I don't know how I can make this any plainer to you. If someone saw you with your friend they could post this same damn thing about you. Don't bother responding, because I was fine having a civil conversation but since you gave up on that and resorted to personal insults, this conversation isn't worth my time any more. Have a good day
---
It's balanced for a legendary. Now he's more in line with Spike and Crow 
---
I was searching on youtube lmaooooo,the update is very soon,they already put up a vid about balance changes
---
You don‚Äôt mean buff, you mean nerf. His super is just for area control now and that won‚Äôt be significant
---
It's Ricochet for sure
---
Sounds incredible. Although I‚Äôm not happy with the Bo Star Power nerf (the nerf is too big), nor with the Mortis Brawl Ball nerf. Mortis is viable in very few game modes, and Brawl Ball, the one in which he is better, will not continue to be completely viable.
---
he got nerfed hard he is basically unusable now
---
Rico now looks like yE oL‚Äô C H U M
---
Thicc ricoüòÅ, the third time i commented the same thing on a post about the video üòÇ, *you're welcome but with piper's voice*
---
you have no proof that they didn‚Äôt do it to push the high levels either lmao
---
That‚Äôs ricochet
---
Rico skin would need to be revamped to suit his new obese short model.
---
So he got reworked? 
---
Mortis also got a double buff... ok. 
---
That's ricochet without the hat
---
Actually not having crow is even worse because you have 1/3 chance to drop crow when dropping a legendary it means you only have 2/3 of your current probability of dropping a good legendary when his probability might have dropped less than that.
---
Then idk how I got my lvl 6 piper to 600 on this map in solo showdown...
---
Where?
---
great summary, i assume you got the inside scoop from the dev team beforehand?
---
Looks like Colt, Rico, and maybe Bo got reskins
---
WHERE IS BULL AND SHELLY NERF YOU KIDDIN ME THESE ARE TEN TIMES MORE BROKEN THAN LEON!!!!!!!!
---
&gt;Reply
---
leon got nerfed 
---
But the pain of getting him to the max... Bull does everything better :/
---
Finally some love for my boy Darryl :)
---
So no crow buff ok then
---
Big chungus version of rico
---
Omg he literally got  a little dmg buff and you say it's double buff when he is now unplayable in bb, gg man
---
Pardon me, Actually English is not my main language.. üòì
---
true, thank you.
---
Bull isn‚Äôt OP bro. 
---
Also I want a crow buff too but he isn‚Äôt that bad
---
‚ù§Ô∏è
---
so you out here being proud of dominating lvl 1 people, gg
---
But the super was what made him better than dyna in certain circumstances, now in heist dyna will just be better. 
---
Also it just takes away fun from playing him. He had the most well designed and flexible super in the game. 
---
I don't like this  
---
Dude rico is damn ugly
---
I was thinking the same thing
---
good question my friend
---
Pumkin should be cuter... Alll of these should be cuter!

Hey hey, SPINsamSPIN. I just want to clarify OliveOil is the #1 barley in the world. 1000 trophies on the brawler, NOT his total trophies. Just clarifying because you deserve more credit. I am happy he won‚Äôt be played much in heist.
---
Why not?
---
Bad Balance Changes. Turrets should get a life time. No Pam Nerf. Barley is dead now. Mortis got +100 Damage. Wow.
---
FeelsBadMan
---
It‚Äôs not year maybe, it is rico.
---
Does nobody realize colt is getting a rework?
---
Rico's in there shifting between his new and old models
---
Lol thanks Sam. Nah I feel like he will be more viable in heist now, just less clutch with his super. He will provide overall better control
---
Saying that you speak Mexican is incorrect because Mexico doesn't have it's own language. Neither does USA, or Australia for example. But all these have unique *cultures*, so when I say 'Mexican themed' what I mean is that the characters *come from* Mexico and represent various aspects of Mexican *culture*.
---
Sure, you can agree to disagree if you like but this is a really simple thing to understand. Not really an opinion based thing. 
---
Nerfed the shit out of level 10 piper. Lol
---
It‚Äôs a rico remodel, I hope a skin tho
---
We don't chose who we face 
---
Ok so just basically put Pyro from tf2 in the game
---
Bull isn‚Äôt op, but there should be something done to his health. He shouldn‚Äôt have such high burst potential and that much health. If played correctly, you can get to rank 20 with Bull with little to none skill
---
Grandma died
---
I got leon today:(
---
Anything to spike?
---
This rico
---
God!
---
Grandma died 
---
When will this start happening, I‚Äòm only at about 300 cups with my brawlers and I don‚Äòt see it that often
---
Cool!
---
Dude he is super op in heist
---
and can't defend himself at close range...
---
I personally think his super was very well designed was very flexible...
---
now they have changed it...
---
SPINsamSPIN would be proud.
---
Ok.
---
My thoughts exactly 
---
Nice art, dood C:
---
Darryl and Mortis will now be easier to use!
---
No
---
Ok... bull is a tank... he has a lot of health and does a lot of damage UP CLOSE try fighting colt or rico or anyone as bull... you gotta out range bull. 
---
Also you can get all brawlers to rank 20 with little to no skillüòú
---
Tules
---
:0
---
So no Pam nerf and no crow nerf thanks 
---
Except spike and Pam 
---
Probably cause he just searched it up
---
Wow nice catch!
---
I play mainly on my iPad Mini 4, and have plenty of storage left
---
Crow is one of the weakest if not the weakest brawler in the game! Y did Supercell not buff him? 
---
me no understand
---
Do you know when will be?
---
Showdown, gem grab.
---
When is it coming?
---
Seriously
---
Yeah. üòò
---
It's a brawlifier it's not gonna be there forever, if you've played cavern churn there will usually be a two or three max bos teaming in the middle or in snake prairie where pretty much all the time who ever has the max bo on their team will win. People rely on his star power so much it's just free trophies for the people who have level 10 bo on their team. The brawlifier just makes snake prairie,cavern churn or island invasion actually makes it fun and uses skill 
---
i do not heave nothing to complain because i got tara about a week ago and leon today. 
---
Die die die
---
Ahhhh thank
---
The design choice I used was copped mostly from smash. I replaced the Skull Pin on her hat with a franklin badge, and the gun is inspired from Jeff Andonuts
---
brawl ball is really the only good map for mortis, why take that away?
---
https://youtu.be/Q4q3yb4qHBw
---
At least give the link to the video: https://youtu.be/IMBc_loB7_0?t=297
---
Thiccer body = thiccer bullets
---
Thiccer bullets = more damage 
---
So when is the official release?
---
Somehow u removed one problem in bball and added a new one.
---
No crow buff either, Pam nerf is my 100% necessity
---
Nope
---
He‚Äôs now a lot worse in his best mode, but he‚Äôs more well rounded for all the other modes imo
---
c h o n k
---
I think that barley nerf was needed
---
Bo*
---
The star power buff tho...
---
Just why?
---
It was already good!
---
You get healed 1800
---
Look what they‚Äôve done to my boy
---
From all the brawlers a barley nerf?o.O
---
leon in the b o x 
---
please
---
Pls buff crow
---
Yeah they suck at brawl ball map changes
---
u/calamity201 had an idea like this a while back
---
You're supposed to use every brawler anyway.... 
---
Better for Frank to receive that damage boost the instant he kills someone rather than having to walk towards it and picking it up. Same with mortis although its now less effective in sd since u can't bank them skulls.
---
Changed it. When You fight against Crow, It's always ez :/
---
We can now say goodbye to Mortis
---
Well you‚Äôre supposed to play with whoever you want but I do use most brawlers... all of mine are over 200 except for like 3 of them... I just meant my favorite ones all look like they‚Äôre getting buffed pretty well 
---
Well bull had a 2 barrel shotgun but Shot 3 times before needing to reload
---
Hawk eyes
---
Frank wore a hat in the December brawl talk, will Frank be our lord and savior??!?!?!?! :0
---
Old
---
@xtilxtil
---
if they were good then they arent the real ones :GWowoHehe:
---
Wow, they used the old music for this
---
Agree 100% except poco he‚Äôs pretty good already
---
It just takes away fun!
---
Barley's super was unique and well designed... 
---
Might just be too stoned but this shot was way too fast for me to read and comprehend.
---
FYI SUPERCELL WE HAVE A BRAWLER NAMED CROW. REMEMBER???!
---
Maybe if you actually looked before you posted you'd see literally every other post is the same thing you just posted. 
---
yikes
---
he's so ugly now 
---
I think that the Mortis nerf is smart, but the Barley nerf is totally unnecessary. 
---
incognito tab üòÇ
---
Also a colt remodel
---
I Agree with this 
---
So I plan for this to be the last spike skin for a while, I really like spike as a brawler and I enjoy coming up with concepts for him because of his round character model, I plan to switch things up pretty soon, any suggestions for which brawler I should start making skins for next?
---
Ik but not for colt tho.
---
The change is already made
---
See on one hand I‚Äôm glad he‚Äôll look like how his portrait depicts him, but on the other hand,
---
Is that a water gun?
---
I loved the skulls idea too, so my guess would be for better optimization maybe? Lots of skulls on the map might not have been good for optimization? Both skull based characters getting this removed makes me think so
---
O o f
---
How can someone not open the game right now? Why wouldn‚Äôt they be able to get on the game but go a website
---
Ryan is just the community manager. The supercell devs are to blame for this monstrosity.
---
How do I favorite a post
---
kairos did it first 
---
Big ricus 
---
Not Rico, it has way more health
---
Dope 
---
Mortis dribbling was high skill gap and made for clutch plays. Not a fan of that brawl ball change at all.
---
So, why Mortis would not be OP?
---
Okay i understand leon needed a nerf; but come on why did you make his super terrible and his damage worse. I mean you couldve just given his damage a bit of a nerf instead.
---
I‚Äôm not liking the brawl ball and bounty changes. 
---
Making shooting take an ammo really benefits some brawlers over others, and ruins the strategy of passing the ball then attacking immediately. 
---
Grass not regrowing is a huge problem because by end game long range will be OP and close range will be useless. I liked the variety of different maps in bounty but it seems they‚Äôll all be long range dominated now. 
---
I‚Äôm willing to give the devs the benefit of the doubt on these because they‚Äôve tested it and I haven‚Äôt. But what I can‚Äôt accept is Barely. PLEASE change back. He had the coolest super in the game by far, as I was telling my friend who recently began playing earlier today. New Barley seems lame and so much strategy was taken from him. 
---
Thicco mode
---
good a Leon nerf. i think his super is good now, but i still think he needs a bit more of a nerf to his damage. guess we will see.
---
He is a baby
---
I don't understand why people like old mortis hes so ugly
---
r/iamverysmart
---
He looks like jessie now 
---
Do you think the change was necessary? What about the buffs it got?
---
What about Dynamike?
---
its not
---
You better start packing your bags than
---
You got that right
---
I think he isn‚Äôt dead in B.B. yet. Bi me able to dribble at all even if it uses all of your ammo is really good
---
They‚Äôre stealing everyone‚Äôs hat tho. Next is gonna be Darryl that‚Äôs a firm bet
---
Wheres the egytian tara one that one was sick
---
Yah , this is where you should stop ....
---
I‚Äôll stick with Rick O‚ÄôShea
---
Colt remodel has been posted several times
---
r/woooosh?
---
I would actually read it if op didnt use caps so much
---
It‚Äôs confirmed, Supercell hates hats 
---
Havent seen any tbh except mine,swear.
---
When you give your friend no producer credit. Smh
---
What do you think the yell at 3 seconds is? A new brawler? New VO?
---
F
---
Correct. I am not a beta tester or am I in any part affiliated with supercell or the brawl stars team. 
---
If you looked before you posted you would find some
---
Can‚Äôt blame them... Leon is annoying.
---
Where's the ice?
---
Out of all the moveset ideas in the comments yours is the most accurate to the actual character! Im keeping it in mind for when I redraw him :)
---
