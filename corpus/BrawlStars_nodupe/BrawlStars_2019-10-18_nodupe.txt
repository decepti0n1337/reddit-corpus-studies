This may be difficult to understand, but Supercell could have made any of the legendaries trophy road brawlers, and no one would have known the difference. Same thing other way around. When you ask for a legendary brawler in TR, you're just asking for another brawler. There's no point in asking for a legendary brawler as a trophy road reward because, you know what, I'm tired of explaining this to the millions of people who ask for this. ITS NOT GONNA HAPPEN, SO QUIT ASKING FOR IT.
---
Me too

Supercell forgot to add it in Shelly

I posted the same thing lmao

Thank you

Jesus Christ man calm down I am not begging for it I am just saying  ‚ÄúOh hey it‚Äôs that they work so hard for it they need a nice prize‚Äù and getting that far in road with a reward of coins kinda makes all that hard work that spender time.... all for nothing and I get the point you are making but Christ calm down man

That's a strategy.

Congragulashons you are a relly great player

In fairness I know how but for me it takes forever

I made a mini mini account like this and played with only shelly, got her to 600 at power 1, this isnt fake the man bought sandy as a flex def a content creator or something
---
Monkey see, monkey do
---
Upvote for effort!!!! I like it :)

What if the robot was constantly in God mode, mini robots and all, but players couldn't attack each other and if everyone died then everyone loses

I like how you wrote 300, crossed it out, and wrote 209

Great work!

Thank you!

YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES

Hmmm, interesting take on crow, but it looks really cool. But I still kind of Expect there to be a plague Doctor Crow, which I will really enjoy and probably get.
---
I was about to frickin pop off once I saw "Did you even read the title?"
---
So much for that free ‚Äòpromotion‚Äô
---
Couple of hours after this post game went to quite easy mode. Surprise surprise.
---
What a GX name tag
---
lmao I'm just seeing hate comments right now and I am laughing so hard
---
I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs great if it gives you no animation that you have it because you can act like you‚Äôre just walking past and then dive in for the kill without them knowing. My favorite one tbh, counters hide-n-seek matches.
---
There is another
---
no matter what, justice always prevails
---
I think it makes more sense than the yeti skin.
---
And it always has to be spike
---
Ye most of the hate comes from you and the random not being coordinated with each other not from them actually having lower skill.
---
don't comment on something you didn't fully read

NEW TROPHI ROAD BRAWLER 8000?????!!!
---
well done mate
---
Yeah that's actually him

your kinda late, but i can't say anything because i only have mecha bo
---
And Brocks too or Genes
---
So guys, we did it. We beat our first Instagram reposter
---
I find it funny how in DMs, he was sooo cocky. He thought he would get away with this lol
---
U should get one soon.
---
guys we need to upvote this
---
Weaker. Damage boost here is 1.5x, so if an attack did 200 damage it will do 300. Juice is 3x so it will be 600 damage.
---
YEP :))
---
*Cries in 14k-ish trophies to not having Crow already*
---
But different countries have different time zones and brawl stars is an international game.
---
If the attacks don't hit the objects they would be basically indestructible.
---
Thanks
---
Nice! He got what he deserves.
---
no the "Poco" is actually Carl, you can even hear his "wanna be friends" line in the video if you have watched it
---
Edit: sorry, he says "still friends?"
---
Do you not feel anger for their team that they got a player like this? Would you like others to laugh at you when you get an own goaler, entirely because 'your trophies don't matter'?
---
What mode did they play?
---
Thanks mate!
---
Yeah but idea is stolen
---
My man, I‚Äôm one of the artists in the collab, I know for a fact that‚Äôs poco, 100% sure
---
np

Yes good job to everyone! We made him learn his lesson the hard way

which one are you talking about? the mummy poco or the silhouette? cuz the silhouette is 100% not poco

Since colt is featured at the beginning of the video, does this mean there won't be any skin ideas for him

I like the ideas? Mind if I change them and give you credit for help?

I don't really see a problem with the water. I used it like this to create 3 lanes for every player to defend/push their lane.

I got all brawlers to 500 showdown only before trophy changes, I barely camped and never teamed, it was hell and could be easier with those things but I‚Äôm glad I did it the way I did

Nvm.. I can screen recording this video.. I just want your permission because I don't want other people say i steal your video (+ i will put credit at that video)

Remember when he said "best ad ever üòÇ"

As a crow you just control the map and push other brawlers together so they would fight eachother.

I‚Äôll never forgive you Piper! (Except Mew Mew, she‚Äôs a good Piper)
---
Yep
---
I mean scarecrow Tara was cool but the idea of a scarecrow skin would fit way better on a different brawler. As for Tara herself, the already-popular mummy skin idea would suit her perfectly.

Read my comment below, you would have a choice between normal brawl ball and brawl ball with "no ball zone". If you are a low dps brawler and you are the only one who defends the goal high hp Brawlers can just walk with the ball into the goal

Guys always put your watermark ‚Ä¶ or‚Ä¶ we will steal your post
---
Yes i think the same
---
Rightt. I got several brawlers to 500 trophies with power 1 and 2
---
Mine is to upgrade and give me sandy 1,410 points and the skin for 269 gems. So that a good deal? I have the gems because I‚Äôve been stingy the last 2 months lol

What a beautiful man

wow i didn't know Captain obvious

i mentioned my trophies so it shows how long i waited üôÉ

Take this down

New skin, reverse Jessie. The turret looks like that while Jessie is just a head with four little legs sticking out.
---
One eyeball cuz you rico
---
Se le arrima.
---
Make mecha jessie (or skin for turret) or end on mecha scrappy?
---
That‚Äôs what i said bro
---
I swear if Mortis don‚Äôt get a buff in the next update...
---
Ryan hasn‚Äôt eyeballed this post yet hmmm
---
It's a game for kids and you are a player and if they do say something mean they can post it here losing players
---
This needs to be in the game
---
It would have been so wholesome if you killed the throwers for bull!
---
Right back at ya, buddy. *kick it*
---
Great
---
Is Mortis getting a buff?
---
Well done
---
Here's a skin that comes in my mind now : Mordecai Crow
---
Tara throw a Good Super but that auto aim..
---
But still, Tara, Rosa and Mortis combo are quite bad to fight 3 range Brawler.. The only damage dealer are Tara (which is not that high, compare to enemy damage)
---
This is the scaryest one cause of the bad wifi moments
---
yes
---
Why is it marked as nsfw
---
So cooooooooool
---
well you can't stop me from watching hentai

ROBO RETREAT

Well boys you know what to do
---
This is so random yet so funny
---
me too, but hey
---
It‚Äôs brawlstarsbrawl all over again...
---
Bro how the heck do you have a legendary at 8k???
---
I have 10k and still no legendary
---
I know I know... that's what happen when you're playing with randoms... you dont have good comp most of the time 
---
but I'm sure we could took them down if tara would aim.
---
well... bye bye for the trophies.
---
I don't want instagram normies steal your posts
---
Maybe turret will be baby jessie with uzi?
---
basically, If you saw frank, he supered and then I curved down to try and avoid it but then forgot that I had the ball
---
you right! we all deserve 10/10!
---
Well i guess you are right, lemme guess you only use serenade poco
---
When?
---
You didn't need to post the whole game
---
Jesus Christ trophies don‚Äôt affect brawlers or your luck
---
Yeah, 500 is way too easy now. I have yet to do it with a Level 1 due to lack of commitment but I got 8-Bit there on Level 2.
---
not sure, she could got another super with 2 full attacks into all of them. and dont forget she got a damage buff.

Just drink the milk

Rule 34 move aside. it's time for rule 63
---
Sorry, Theres no kiros living there
---
It has Mecha Crow's body
---
I think they have posted too many teasers for it to be on Sunday. I‚Äôm placing my money on BT being tomorrow.
---
IS A PAM REMODEL seriously
---
Don‚Äôt say this
---
When there is pee in your balls.
---

Every member in r/Brawlstars
---
It's not an upcoming brawler. It's just a concept. He did another video a while back talking about the next brawler being Piper's cousin (I think) and claimed that she was leaked.
---
The brawler was Tick...
---
Sorry I forgot the bear

Isn't OP the Poco ?

200 seems balanced wdym
---
WELL DONE! This is the best 8 bit art
---
Hello Pam remodel and skin!
---
What the fuck did I just look at
---
I bought robo spike with the epik spike skin
---
Something is coming...But I don't know  what
---
Cavern churn, better chance of dynamikes, but too many Rico‚Äôs with bouncy bullets
---
Windows xp
---
Literally every female character
---
Penetrating a turret should be on EVERYONE'S list of things to do
---
You are (not) doing okay 3.0 + 1.0
---
For those who have not understood, try singing
---
Abcdefg hijklmnop
---
Lmnop is super fast( like Leon with smoke trails) to sing while the rest is slow( like 8-bit)
---
Well I don't and neither do the people who are protesting against your comment so uh...no
---
and now they're "trying" to give credit to owners to save face... I still think what they're doing is wrong.. the fact that they gained a large fanbase because of stolen posts is just nasty
---
Wait what?
---
Mortis buff??
---
Whut rules?
---
Trophies don't show nor imply any timeframe. That's literally what he meant "captain obvious". 
---
I can legit be 8k trophies and push to 14k within a week. Doesn't mean that I suddenly am more entitled to a legendary.
---
Yes thats true
---
Then don't reply to him. Make a seperate comment.
---
Que ingenuos...
---
üòç so cool effect!
---
They should make shelly say ZA WARDO when she uses her super
---
15
---
i am not sure but i think if you reinstall this game you will lose your account
---
Admit it, any legendary is better than none
---
Davy Jones.
---
Trust me, if I were to make a "skin idea" meme, I would be blasted with "r / shitty brawl stars " and "stop posting low effort karma farm posts" comments
---
Is Buff coming to Mortis?
---
omg i dont really like mortis but i would buy this skin
---
Good Eye!

Selling it is illegal ya know?
---
wow well seen
---
They always have a hidden video, just like what I counted, 39 vids but it says 40, then i posted my discovery to reddit and they all say there is always an unlisted video. I remember there was a trailer before global launch, but it disappeared.
---
Me at 15,7k*
---
good catch
---
Great artwork!
---
Thanks man
---
I gave that cause it can happen anytime, not what happened in your replay.
---
:( are you in HoodieHomies? For my first maxed brawler (primo), I waited like 2k trophies from 5k to 7.5k before the trophy inflation to get a star power, and it wasnt even good
---
Hold on let me guess Mortis loses his hat again.
---
Oh then you deserved this. Btw yes im in
---
Thanks!
---
Is this an official image ?
---
I like this idea because it's not to difficult to implement! I hate it when people ask for irrationally large things to be added.
---
I almost pissed my pants seeing this
---
This is so good, so many good skin ideas for our boy
---
I'm Ninja :D
---
What do you post on again?
---
Ramdoms: Passing the ball to your own goal üëç
---
Im Yusuf, they guy who hostes the friendly match last night, wanna play again btw
---
Trying to get at least a legendary at 14.4k trophies -.-
---
You got lucky :)
---
Matchmaking is worse than it ever has been. I often play with my 700+ brawlers as a 16K brawlers, getting paired with people at 2 and 4 thousand total trophies. ***Just because you have one brawler over 500 as a 2K player does not mean you have the skill to play at the 15K level!*** I hope supercell realizes this and implements a league system instead of the current brawler-trophy matchmaking system.  
---
I would rather have my matchmaking take a minute longer each time than constantly have noob randoms. I would rather play with a 14k player who has a power level 7 rico instead of a 3k player who has a star power shelly. Overall trophies are a mark of skill, not brawler trophies.
---
Ok :D
---
i need coins
---
Oki lets go
---
Yes...
---
Yeah, I got my first and only at 14.5k so I can‚Äôt even imagine your pain
---
r/wholesomebrawlstars
---
Totally agree. Pro players shouldn‚Äôt have to play either friends to gain trophies they should be able to pair up with randoms and be able to win some games!
---
It only takes 5 minutes to connect. Once you do that you can forget it forever.
---
Bet you didnt get shelly with gems
---
Your next goal is 15k good luck
---
#yes finally
---
Let's bring this modasucka down
---
BANDITA SHELLY
---
It will make the game more easier to f2p
---
#lets report this guy as well
---
Quests changed clash so they can change brawl
---
No. And they don‚Äôt try to balance it out. It‚Äôs pure luck. All based on rng. Unless you spend money.
---
What is the blurred out word?
---
*unloads shotgun in target's face*
---
This is dani
---
Not that good one has 2 years ine 1 years and one 2 week old
---
If it‚Äôs on, wherever you first touch to move your brawler, your joystick will lock in that spot instead of being able to move anywhere on the left side of the screen.
---
u/Grif54321 your waiting has paid off
---
Thanx
---
Good trick
---
Nice bro
---
It‚Äôs basically confirmed now with Ryan replying with the oh so iconic üëÄ emoji
---
Very creative !
---
Wut
---
Missed opportunity to have sucker be shaped and coloured like brains!
---
Mega box = 15
---
I wish you added lores to game(character lores).
---
Make male piper.
---
Madness
---
I hope this is added to the game
---
Same there bro.
---
That is not true it is haloween he wants some candy man
---
SUKA BLYAT
---
Round two
---
does force quitting the app not work?
---
but jessie isnt plus size
---
This is cancer. I'm a instagramer myself but i make brawl stars content myself. No reddit posts at all exept 2 only and I gave credit. These people are just hungry for attention BECAUSE SOME KIDS DONT EVEN KNOW REDDIT AND THEY THINK HE MADE IT.
---
Well I'm not the one who created it so
---
She cannot be buffy cuz she will be nerfed anyways.
---
magician rico
---
Now that's true terror
---
eew, someone's playing Piper in brawlball, but there's frank ! so it's good !
---
Why?
---
Sup my guy! Was so good hanging out last night! Hit me up after work we can meet up with Cindy and Joe them at the club. Party!  K see you tonight!
---
Ya i just limited my time alittle playing matches with my kid because i lose 100 and was trying to crack 6. Now i know i can jam with him and have no worries.
---
Creatures of the night, rise up!
---
r/nextfuckinglevel
---
New brawler.
---
So that was that neon thing
---
Thanks you so puch gedi
---
Much*
---
Creature of the night!
---
Frank?
---
I dont see this post 
---
And when he said it?
---
The rules of brawl stars subreddit dont say it 
---
It mean i can made it.
---
If i dont  right please say in what moment i wrong
---
P.s. do you like the figure?
---
r/lostredditors
---
Mrs Obama, i've done it. I've stopped racism.
---
Then just imagine piper with ambush at far range with energy drink inside 8-bit turret
---
Can't find the account tho. They have either changed name again or deleted/privated it, Idk
---
Hey guys you might not believe this but i opened piper yesterday so I couldnt replay it but it happened again..... In a matter of 20 minutes at max!
---
The manga is sometimes better than the anime tho
---
These are honestly really impressive. Nice job!
---
I was afraid that suggestion my computer gave me wouldnt be what I thought it was, too late now
---
LOOL xD. This is best skin xD
---
Anime is better then manga
---
yeah! 1400 star points when he only needs 300
---
Well how you just went to places not fit for this subreddit.
---
I know, but at least it‚Äôs not as obvious as some things i could have done
---
I was using colt in takedown and had 12 power cubes, there was a colt with zero, I spared him, with me around him, the others didn't approach him
---
Lag but it has a body
---
everyone eccept you
---
the 3x tickets are there for a reason i don't think it will be just a new environment
---
Lol actually all of my Art is on my Deviantart but thanks I guess (PapsTheRadSkatist)

I love the effort but dont want this in the game.

Repost

"Brawloween"

New debuff:

Diabetes
---
Will insta kill any brawler if they eat too much
---
Ohh...I know thats a pain. How did you block out the highlights...crayon technique?
---
Biper moment
---
*i knew rico was hot,but this is too much*
---
Mi gusta la prima guapa.
---
Look its another reposter with no talent
---
All for people
---
You mean how I did the Highlights?
---
I colored over the drawing with a light shade of a color then colored the rest the darker color, leaving the highlights where I want them to be.
---
Ok that's perfect
---
Praise da lord this exists.
---
tell me how it happened?
---
Not really
---
In case you wanted to know I was playing on escape velocity map and you can see bats flying around over it if you wait long enough.
---
*I'll main rico asap*
---
Bs
---
Yes because is cool
---
Yes fellow gene
---
No, a mortuary is pretty much a funeral home. It doesnt have to be a certain size. I've had to go to a mortuary before when my mom passed and that one does kind of look like a mansion.
---
I was told from a friend that the best time to get Supercell‚Äôs attention is 5-7 Am Pacific time since that‚Äôs when the will be most likely to see it
---
Bho
---
PNG..?
---
Let's go ban brawlpapers now
---
That post with Crow Is my idea, but he did put my reddit profile
---
It‚Äôs better than losing any trophies
---
Supercell: Something is coming...  (but what?)
---
Me: a ticket event
---
nice 69 points
---
brawl stars added some water in brawl ball last time ‚Ä¶but the issue was whenever you throw the ball in the water,the ball will be stuck there for long time.
---
this should have gotten a silver medal before dying atleast
---
Vietnam flashbacks
---
Reload speed would be better
---
thanks for giving free nightmares
---
he doesn't edit his posts, thats why you can see your own watermark
---
Have him shoot spam at you. While his tower will be malware code.
---
He post 2 picture one with my idea and one with my profile on reddit
---
It kinda looks like him
---
They are 3v3 modes so if a team loses it's considered all member's fault, as they all win trophies they also all lose trophies, then 9/10 the sistem would choose badly the "bad player".
---
No hat mortis= no creature of the night
---
Nah once I said I team in Showdown with dynamikes as mortis and they said "fuk yu" and banned me for the next 56 years... no Im not lying you are
---
I mean, it's literally the alphabet song, but okay
---
Damn whats ur trophy im at 15k missin sandy
---
Leon's old star power is so good for this
---
well compared to the shitty memes on this subreddit , you actually need brain cells to come up with something like this. respect to OP
---
WHOS COMING!
---
they are not supposed to know that
---
Why do I get pelted with downvotes
---
"nObOdY wIlL rEMeMbER mY nAmE"
---
**gets reported by a ton of people**
---
Oh wait what have I done ITS MORTIS MONTH RUN MY FELLOW DYNAS
---
Oh goddamn it not the brawlstars cactus
---
What do you mean organized teaming?
---
Eh, leave zombies to frank. Leon could be a ghost
---
Or was that your boyfriend? The one you were arguing with against me on r/shittybrawlstars?
---
Well yes but actually no
---
Wow didn't notice that
---
Ah so Samantha is controlling zombie Leon (only real gamers will understand)
---
This was actually teased in the retropolis teaser because in the background there was a mortuary
---
Is that a bald spot on his back
---
I like the frank edit it's like regi from Nintendo edited to regi-gigas
