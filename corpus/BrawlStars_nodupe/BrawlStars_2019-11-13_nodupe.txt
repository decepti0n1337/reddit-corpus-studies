The first guy I killed had 3 stars.

So appropriate

Clash Royale called, they want their island back
---
Watch it, nerd!
---
Honestly if I had been one of the 13 cube guys I would have accepted that I was being too cocky
---
Yes
---
no it's Instagram, but I posted an image of it on my reddit and it's on the account @brawlstars.memes
---
OC link?
---
Flair checks out
---
Was that a pun?
---
No
---
i had never seen it , maybe i have a common post idea
---
That was not intended
---
Is it for real?
---
I wish! But no, it's blocked off by some mesh
---
I can imagine that. You did not do well. Anyone can kill anyone with anyone. Piper can kill bull too easily, yet bull can also kill piper too easily. If you kill Mortis as dynamike, then tell us, okay?
---
Lol
---
Alright bet
---
Yes, but you need to tell us what app u using to make these videos
---
I‚Äôm at 12K in the same boat. No Mortis or legendaries. Very sad indeed.
---
We're both pretty good looking dudes
---
It's just a filter

What do you like / dislike of the current state of Brawl Stars Esports?

Idk maybe bc you were a long ranged brawl
---
Do you have all brawlers unlocked?
---
I thght i wasn't worth having a conversation with , you proved yourselves wrong , haha  you talked about buffs and nerfs i talked about how youtubers have massive influence on brawlstars   decisions and how it's us players who are affected by this ... you are just trying to make yourself seem correct on a completely unrelated topic clown.
---
This looks really good! That pose looks difficult to draw but you pulled it off really well :0
---
&gt; What‚Äôs your favorite burger topping?
---
Chepo: I... don't know? Ketchup I guess?
---
Crying: Ketchup
---
Slash: I'd say fried onions.
---
Yeah adding a mecha skin between Halloween and Christmas would really fit the theme...
---
U have a negative karma bro get help
---
&gt; What do your friends IRL think of all this?
---
Slash: That's definitely a troll question from one of my IRL friends.
---
And you sound like someone who wants to Nerf Leon AGAIN
---
i used to use dynamike on this map until he got to rank 21, and thats when it no longer worked
---
And tbf it would make a pretty cool teaser for some new modes with possible connection to brawler lore
---
I use el primo to kill shelly
---
Tell me how do you get killed by shelly
---
&gt; Why is it so hard to find a club it'll actually back you up and play games with you
---
Slash: We honestly wouldn't know, we've always made our own clubs with friends. It's also hard since there aren't any club features like Club Wars, so there isn't much incentive to join one.
---
Piper: *gets nerfed*
---
Leon:
---
#SO COLT WILL HAVE A SON?!?
---
Hey tribe gaming, vemal here. Just asking that how did u guys make it to world finals. Well I wish u guys win the game and the prize pool. Love from Australia
---
Most of my friends are ex vets they're not really into playing combat games which I can understand I'll keep trying good luck in Korea
---
&gt; If i am correct you collabed/teamed with IX gaming, which apparently won the NA regionals and qualified for the Championship earlier. Could you clarify? O.O
---
Slash: Yeah, it was never the plan to stay with IX Gaming, they always knew it was a possibility we would go elsewhere for Worlds. We left IX on great terms, and we all love David (IX's founder).
---
I mean lots of people do that so banning him just isn‚Äôt fair.

You said youtubers said spike needed to be nerfed. You. You said that. I‚Äôm responding to what you said. Remember my initial comment where I also mentioned the change to siege that was implemented BECAUSE THE COMMUNITY wanted it? You‚Äôre a dipshit. Now I‚Äôm done. Have a good life, mouthbreather.
---
&gt; How‚Äôs it feel knowing you bouta get slapped by Nova ü§´
---
Chepo: Well, we already clapped them, so...
---
Yea they should base matchmaking on average trophies
---
*friends
---
Ooh this is nice
---
Exactly the opposite. Like the youtubers, I thought Leon‚Äôs latest nerf was completely unnecessary. He‚Äôs worthless in anything other showdown.
---
use [this](https://brawlstats.com/events)
---
She was in a bush and I did not know she was there so then she blasted me with her super 3 times in a row thats why
---
Majority of people agree that her super is op tho
---
&gt; What do you think, who is better to max as f2p? Rico or Dyna?
---
Crying: Rico, I think he has better star powers overall.
---
&gt; Some tips on graveyard shift?
---
Chepo: I've actually only ever played one graveyard shift game...
---
Crying: I don't play the gamemode either
---
&gt; Hat or no hat?
---
Hat.
---
Mortis is pretty good on this map
---
For me, it's
---
Trophy Road: Bull
---
Rare: Primo
---
Super Rare: Darryl
---
Epic: Bibi
---
Mythic: Mortis
---
Legendary: Leon
---
&gt; What are some tips for pushing with randoms?
---
Chepo: Just don't. lol
---
huh..
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
**so thats where the brawlers are stored**
---
uhh, the comment section for this video says otherwise, and if u see some youtuber named kairostime, he released an updated tier list where he gathered around 13 pros to decide where each brawler lies, they said shelly was at the bottom, now i know it's not 100% accurate, but they have to be somewhere close, and they can't mess up shelly's placing so badly
---
&gt; What‚Äôre your thoughts on Supercells more recent balance changes
---
Chepo: I think the changes are fine, I like the Spike nerf on Curveball. Thanks for supporting us!
---
It does look like it
---
&gt; How are you ?
---
Good.

If you're doing a daily dose of memes, please don't post repetitive messages! This will toxicate the subreddit

This would be really cool , but they would never add something like that because it does not match their theme

Tbh this seems unnecessary, the game mode selection screen isn‚Äôt that crowded, and this just seems like it would be confusing for new players

Damn your spelling is trash you'll be here from the start till the end yet you haven't even slightly you realise that as adulthood kicks in we will soon move on also you said you pay money for brawlstars what a waste also as a professional speaking here you habe no superiority on me yet you act as if you own the game
---
Beautiful!
---
As tempting as that may sound at some time or another, I thought they banned or restricted people doing that? I mean I don't want to torment anyone, I save that for solo showdown messing around with Morti Coiled. But that seems like an extremely easy way to not only tilt but get banned/reported. Supercell not on top of that stuff?
---
Nice, lol I thought Darryl's Barrel was Summer Jessie's water gun at first.

Isn't shelly hispanic tho? Also, wtf they shoot Brock cuz he's black?
---
Yea i didnt get star player
---
I'd save my coins for leveling up the rest of my brawlers. Star powers will appear from the boxes sooner or later, usually later. I've never bought any of mine, and probbly never will. As far as you don't have fully maxed account, collecting coins is so painful if you don't like to use real money.
---
You'll still have at least .3900
---
Ok thnx a lot i will save up

I mean, delete the game if your banned

Sooo adorable

It's a nice idea, but I think you should have the Brawl Talk video release *before* the event launches, and then have the update launch when the goal is accomplished instead.
---
Three teachers at my actually play BS, as far as I know.
---
Well, I went to the center bush in Forsaken Falls. Successfully took out some throwers and a couple Genes. When it was Showdown, I was facing off a Crow. It was pretty scary, but he didn't have super and I had, so just jumped on him and quickly finished him off. After that, I realized El Primo isn't a good choice in GS.

If so then make it so that it will be somewhat useful to them (and everyone) aswell, like maybe a shortcut so that you can go across the wall to the other side of the wall instead of going all the way around the wall, but it will be a oneway and you have to go around the wall to back to your previous position.

Brawl Stars is currently in 5th place right now
---
the game mode is unbalanced yea you can push high in it but people just spam Colt,Bull and don‚Äôt shoot eachother and just the robot i feel gamemodes that don‚Äôt incentivize the players to damage eachother should be ticketed events takedown taking up its own spot is just adding a matching que that people rarely use (btw i dont have the stats just based off mm times ik people barely play it) and i feel a rework could be implemented like maybe multiple robots with near impossible hp to take out with a 2 min timer so taking out enemies would actually be a strategy to keep a robot to yourself and gain many power cubes with invincible intervals (like it is now) and spawns closer to the middle because if you spawn far away from the robot (which is cliche but happens more then you‚Äôd think) this game mode could be actually competitive and fun but at the moment it‚Äôs just a Colt target practice simulator i don‚Äôt hate the mode i just objectively think it‚Äôs the worst and least skillful mode in the game and extremely boring to play but ik it‚Äôs someone‚Äôs favorite game mode and that‚Äôs fine but it‚Äôs just not fun to me and most hardcore players only grind it to get there Colts/Bulls 750+ not actually because it‚Äôs fun

could be a funny skin idea

Yes But the ultimate example of not caring is he just sleeps on the ground like he doesn't give a shit about what's going on

Darryl can actually be all right, and bibi can camp with batting stance
---
Those gedi-kor skins on the box
---
My bibi personal best is 753
---
insert not funny didnt laugh meme here
---
How do U get to that
---
Imagine playing Mortis and getting all the bolts with ur penny whilst your barley attacks the water as if it killed his dog
---
Ewwww...
---
So filthy...
---
But I why are there no posts in your profile of the brawler did you deleted it
---
Mortis, bringer of doom.
---
Oh cool the change the sonic model but i think you're in the wrong subreddit.
---
El Primo looks like Stan from American Dad.
---
Wdym gru?

That‚Äôs Instagram for ya

dont need to be rude its just an advice to grind more upvotes

It's adorable how you think you are in fact not an idiot, when you really really are. Perhaps one day when you grow up, you will look back and cringe at your posts as I have.
---
Well it must be coming shortly then
---
I think it needs a remodel
---
I guess so

Lock screen rotation?
---
Krappy kake update thats mere cosmetics, besides I wonder how much money they really want to spend after that big flop of their Rush Wars turded  out this year, and I bet they lost Millions with that stinker.
---
I have none :c
---
Geez it‚Äôs already been a year?! Time goes fast! üòÖ
---
But he fights 24/7 in BS ü§£
---
Holy flip that looks amazing!
---
i forgot to cut it , the video except first 20secs are irrelevant
---
You should have put sans
---
Ah, i see an italian man of culture
---
A: Don‚Äôt have an answer. But for the first 2/3s of the video, everything he did looked laggy to me. I could be wrong. He could have just been throwing, my point is don‚Äôt assume unless it‚Äôs blatant. To me, this ain‚Äôt blatant.
---
B: Bibi, who‚Äôs actually useful defending against bots, attacking the Ike, and attacking tanks. Mortis is poor play if you‚Äôre playing with randoms.
---
By me i mean
---
Dynamike turning into the bush
---
You got your first legendary last week.....Leon. That‚Äôs what your post said. Why do this?
---
#why
---
NuTs AnD bOlTs
---
I get is. Use his second star power then.
---
Well no, because it only activates when you kill someone, and you will already go full health as soon as you kill someone.
---
Not that old. Sandy came out in September.
---
A:Fair point
---
B:Also fair enough
---
Lmao mortis is one of the best brawlers on siege, hes fast and can steal bolts, you are just trash if you don't know how to play whit mortis, and those are some facts right here
---
I want so much that shiba Bruce! :O
---
Oh shit. Were you the mortis?
---
Is this kind of stuff going to get sued?
---
Possibly
---
I'm still waiting to get a legendary for 16 months
---
Star Shelly???
---
You can go anywhere with Leon‚Äôs
---
It‚Äôs possible that there are leftover odd star points from the old star point system, when it would just cut in half the number of trophies over 500. If someone was 18 trophies over 500 then they could get 9 star points from that old system.
---
Tell that to frostyin1 for playing mortis and losing
---
Mhe my parents call me that so no problem
---
Or maybe you just suck
---
They could of made it like this on purpose to not get sued but I think it's really poorly designed
---
Is no one gonna point out that, that ATTACK doesnt exist in the battle.
---
*Meet the Teamers
---
Me, (nice edit)
---
Don't beg for upvotes

If that‚Äôs the worst thing they call you, you‚Äôre doing better than me.

Both are one time buyable.
---
Darwin said something about this...
---
Lol her three gamemodes
---
"Grass grows, birds fly, sun shines and brother, I come back from the dead!"
---
Frank is buggy in brawl ball
---
Star Shelly was for accounts created before 2018 actually
---
H√©, he drew those brawlers I will never get.
---
I like the bomb behind the palm
---
We are talking about the google play awards lol
---
Nah it gets worse and sometimes they cheat and do /Give Parent Belt_1 and /Enchant Belt Sharpness 1000000000
---
If you had his first star power you could have outrun it fast
---
Yeah i get that, thats how he got 9 in the first place, i am just asking whether its no longer possible or not since that system was changed and now we are rewarded with a reward containing zero (and 5) as the last digit
---
I see a Mortis-Leon wolf crossover and a guy with a mustache but looks like be has two mouths instead üò≠
---
Sadly, those are made for korean elementary schoolers who do not even know what copyright is... but like bs
---
Ah. I see
---
Don't feel too desperate, he didn't even have all the mythics, epics, legendaries but now he has sandy and spike he got both of them within a week.
---
?
---
True
---
So good, you do so many good work
---
1. Go to play syore

2. Click on google play awards

3. ***do eat***

He's right we do

---
Every time,

---
Yeah and they should delete the bolts in siege because it spawns a robot but the robot is too op
---
I mean with exclusive skins that you can't buy at anytime : lion dance brock , royal agent colt , damplin Darryl, santa Mike , lil helper penny , Nita's skin , werewolf Leon , witch shelly and calavera piper

I promise you that the people who do this kind of thing, They have reasons

Uh nope? I made this myself lmfao

They either think it's funny because they dont care about the game too much, are trying to lose trophies  for some reason, or even something else

Hey, thank you for pointing it out! I will contact the person directly on IG. Sad that people just take things and work from others and pretend it is their own :(
---
yeah we may get a new mode for clubs this time (i hope)
---
Probably he's talking about a bug fix update, it might be coming next before the actual November update
---
maybe op meant mobile game of the year? cuz thats a thing iirc
---
**sees hair** Wait, that's illegal
---
Tip on drawing fingers btw, use yours as reference
---
Probably because they are working on the Xmas update.

Dude my b I need upvotes

It all makes sense now

10.5K i'm not flexing
---
Time to ban another account
---
I need this map n o w
---
I like your idea. But shouldn‚Äôt the devs make a big update to make it game of the year? We already do so much... am i right? 
---
Just to note I am NOT against Brawl stars getting GOTY.
---
Mecha bo is better, but i like crow more
---
"Hardest choices require the strongest wills"
---
I got my first epic at 7K

Lol this is like begging for upvotes WITHOUT begging cuz its a meme, i love it! 1 upvote
---
Over 15k, all brawlers, I'm sorry
---
Thnx
---
Nice spelling.
---
Awesome!
---
It‚Äôs been said to come back by the devs, other than star Shelly ofc
---
If attack animation wasn't a thing, i could've cost 30 gems
---
Oops sorry
---
What app is that
---
Use really common brawlers. Mortis might be good in Brawl Ball, but only if you're skilled and only in specific team builds. Frank would be better because he's much more versatile in Brawl Ball  
---
Press the "play again" button with any decent players  
---
If all else fails, Solo Showdown and Life leech (Graveyard Shift for newbies) will help. Sitting in a bush for 1 minute in Life Leech should gain you some trophies
---
Respect++
---
I am sure you guys all lost NNN watching this, HU?

Where's her 3rd eye?

Your odds of getting a legendary must be high! Keep going never give up!
---
thats a weird way to spell piper
---
Where am I?
---
What is the endgame here? You get easier games elsewhere after this?
---
I think OP means wait for a new drop, like a new brawler, which my guess is gonna come in december
---
Proof?
---
i got 2 brawlers in 1
---
Lol üòÇ
---
Lemme send you the recording
---
OP means over powered.. Sorry I am not English, I don't completly undersandüòÇyes it's sure, if there isn't a new brawler this update, it will be the next
---
Can‚Äôt believe the brawlers‚Äô trophies at the end, that all 3 on your team would fall for that
---
Yeah but El Primo won'tüòÇ
---
but when you have it??
---
it would be double that
---
Ok, on reddit OP also means the person who posted the thread
---
At least I got ware wolf Leon
---
for me it says not found ._.
---
I am impressed, but pls don‚Äôt spin on people , it feels rude. Again, very impressed
---
But update eill be bigger ehen you pay 99$
---
What a fricken monstrosity to do
---
Ahh okay
---
What is your xp level
---
Just 1
---
Ok, I still respect the drawing cause she‚Äôs one of my favorite characters
---
community: rush wars is dying
---
supercell: surprise, global release for rush wars
---
I would be greatly afraid if I was facing off against you, also funny clip at the end
---
Okay, ya, that makes a lot of sense,
---
He my first legendary at 5k
---
hope you guys get what i say we need more ideas for clubs rather than club wars
---
That‚Äôs strange I thought I saw this before
---
Imagine if he has no hat at all, just too much hair.
---
in 4 day i got bibi piper genee and tara :)
---
It's in Korea
---
Only if youre not smart about your upgrades.
---
Focus on buying all PP from the shop for ONE brawler until you get him to level 9. Then you juat unlock his star powers from regular boxes.
---
I got Barley to level 10 before hitting the 3k trophy mark (before the trophy rework).
---
Also, BS is the most F2P-friendly game Supercell has EVER made.
---
*cries in only 1 epic and 1 mythic at 8,5k trophies*
---
Oof
---
he doesn't need a nerf tho
---
Now let's wait for the r/mortisgang
---
at least I have 50 cents LOL
---
Those voice lines are genius!
---
You knoww What thanks for The kind words. Realy made my Day.
---
at least I have a life LOL
---
I only have 4 friends :(
---
It's food but why she have 2 mouths and no legs
---
They need to slow down with brawlers. The game's roughly a year old and there's a lot of them, and a bunch of them (particularly the newer ones) are pretty boring/unoriginal.
---
Yeah it's really weird how this could just happen randomly I was trying to recreate that moment and i couldn't
---
I hate it too, u probably hate it cuz it was so overused when it first came out
---
#*PIPER*
---
Oo t√ºrk varüòÇ
---
He could have the game laging
---
You deserve so many more upvotes, but people here prefer lame memes
---
I appreciate the effort put into making this, but I am absolutely 100% opposed to it. I like the simple mode selection screen now, and have no desire to navigate a virtual island to play a game.
---
One shudders to imagine what inhuman thoughts lie behind that mask. Dreams of chronic and sustained cruelty.
---
Rule 34, oh shit he we go again

Las nuevas skin el primo ladron un costo de 800 genas y leo  en capuchado azul cpun coato de 1000 gemas:v
---
I NEEEEEED IIIIIIITTTT
---
‚ÄúThen every tank brawler e.g bull rosa  primo will become so bad its unbelievable‚Äù (unBULLievable)
---
It shows a icon now tho. How do you fall for something un front of you with a clear indication. Is there something im not getting??
---
1. r/woooosh
---
2. I dont do NNN.
---
Wait. People play leon in heist?
---
Big Rip in the chat for crow
---
Let's hope so
---
Leoniverssary
---
Nita as well
---
Very Hot, it really is.
---
*angry dynamike noises*
---
Oh he got promoted because a co in my club thought he was a friend of mine
---
Yes but only under 50% how many people are under fire and under 50%
---
Thats a child u monster.
---
#good one
---
Good against tanks but i agree thay 20% is amazigly good.
---
That's your 2 acc am I right
---
Leon is on the 4th bed but he is invisible :)
---
I thought Cory was the bringer of cringe!
---
Once i Got 2 star powers for popƒôd and bibi
---
Remodel... repost... we need one not the other.
---
Let me guess... oh yeah, not me
---
Looks great
---
this picture creeps me out
---
Because there will be 2!! That's what he wants to say. 120% sure about that. Yeah
---
11/10
---
Also ever since I got extra toxic I haven't used carrion crow not even in power play
---
Last time I got a mythic brawlers was 4 months ago (Around that). I have to get gene and all legendaries and I‚Äôm 15k trophies.
---
üëç
---
And that's a fact
---
Spike and Carl are probably the scariest.
---
Im still waiting for both :(
---
Yea I was insanely lucky I got crow to level 9 opened about 3 boxes then got carrion crow then 10 boxes later extra toxic
---
This subreddit is making no nut november very hard for me  
---
\*good cosplay, upvote
---
Your do talented
---
For me this luck was with darryl, i putted him on 9 and went to bed and the first box in the morning i got steel hoops. But yeah i want extra toxic more than carrion crow.
---
which brawl talk?
---
Guess who still needs gene, Leon. Spike, crow, and sandy... and is at 15k trophies... meeeeeee üôÉ
---
Lol I got Leon's at 2000 and crow at 8000
---
Just trying to show he has no legendaries lmao
---
piper went kalashinkov mode
---
it is actually teaming  
---
i want to stop other people to do a greater damage than me  
---
but everyone stars atacking me (like 4 people) but i have 15 powercubes and make them run away
---
Its name is minesweeper
---
Congrats on 10k, but you still have quite a bit to go so good luck. Also it‚Äôs trophies not trofies
---
I don't get it
---
Pls suscribe to my channel is _-slid3-_14
---
But I hope sc can rework that one and make it better rather than plainly just nore damage.
---
No hat, but you need a comb
---
You‚Äôre saying these thigs bc u dont have emz ... idiot
---
The new sonic remake is significantly better
---
Morper, as an alternative name, is the name of my nightmares.
---
Uhhh where‚Äôs that hand goin Kairos?
---
Leon and Nita are siblings canonically
---
Do yu now da wae
---
idk, I would save for token doublers.
---
El Taco
---
A rockability i see? I prefer the hat but i respect this amazing skin :)
---
True, this just makes it another way to get a guaranteed star power
---
Thanks for that. I'll be sure to do so.
---
I prefer how it is atm.
---
He is probably 10
---
Its just a friendly mode game and they knew that penny was going to put her turret there
---
I knew that
---
Broken
---
Also how do I get the Mortis icon on me like you have
