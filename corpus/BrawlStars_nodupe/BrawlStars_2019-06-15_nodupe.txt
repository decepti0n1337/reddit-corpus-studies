Aww, how cute

Oooh I love this. It's a lot like hot maze too which is gone now. Upvote from me. Mind if I repost and give you credit? I'd love having this in-game.

Funny pun

You need someone with speed and range to dodge rockets and keep the shooter bots away from your tanks. Jessie isn’t a great choice. Colt with his star or Leon in her place and you have a solid comp.

Huh, that is a good strategy... Nice...

Also, all new map ideas should be posted in the r/Brawlmaps subreddit. Thanks.

Congrats

It's not the rockets that get me, it's the sweeping wave of lasers.  Jessie and Leon have the same HP and Colt has less, so he will always go down in one sweep if I'm anywhere within 180 degrees of his front when he decides to do the move.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Bull and Primo can use their special to dodge, but what are y'all doing to get past this? It feels broken and impossible.
---
Damn dude see you on the front page this is epic!
---
You gotta type more than a title buddy
---
Couldn't, Agree More.
---
Go to the home page of the subreddit, three dots top corner and change user falir
---
Would he shoot nuts?
---
Sorry, because this essentially defeats the whole purpose of the map but 1 block spaces are very hard for brawlers to get through and they are not on any in game maps. Thank you!
---
Brawl stars needs to copy Fortnite skins lmao
---
Thanks for the replies, guys. I've certainly seen my share of reamers(almost always throwers) and I'd hate to get lumped in with that lot.

Also, please post all maps in r/Brawlmaps subreddit.

Imagine a new brawler with that kind of super/star power
---
Unless you pay2win like this boi
---
But long rangers kill me always
---
It's actually the best skin in the game in terms of how much it adds.  It's worth way more than 150, but not 300.
---
I feel bad for you honestly, btw what stage are you on rn?
---
Ill help
---
Farm boxes and get super fed. Find long range brawlers off guard by hiding in bushes or behind obstacles until you can punish at close range

no u

Haha. Keep using Shelly. And keep failing. Genius.

Hey now i wonder

Thanks man I’ll dm u a invite code

My favorite part of angry robo maps is the robot targets teamers. Who proceed to obliterate the robot and split the power cubes making the teamers even stronger. Genius supercell. Absolutely genius.
---
She was at 1.4k while I'm at 8.8k and she kept on dying the whole match
---
Just make a frekin maze and ban the use of dynamike and barley

Na not like pam and colt

Beat expert with mortis and piper. Clearly the new meta.

Actually its June 14th, 2019 UWU

Sorry mate this comment is underrated

List goes on...

If I have 1 million dollars I can get a good job and I get a legendary and so I can be happy

**he's club is raw...hecking raw**
---
WITH PENNY's STAR POWER?!?! you can easily deal tons of damage to the boss!?
---
Highly relatable 10/10
---
Master isn’t hard tho, when you reach insane 4 you can’t be using nita or penny -_-
---
Haply cake day partner
---
The mematic is supposed to be ironic 😂
---
Thx
---
F
---
Yeah. We almost beat insane with piper and mortis. Our primo sucked. Bull Pam colt with star/Leon is the meta.
---
Have an upvote from the creatures of the night

ok, is bounty, ok

I was spectating yde today and he was using bull/pam/carl, he was on insane 9 if I am not mistaking.

Jess with star power is good
---
i'm a toxic idiot that doesn't know how to gain trophies
---
It's kinda a good idea but the emote button will cover some parts of the screen
---
Love it
---
Hahaha good one, using the same exact thing I called someone else.  Your so original man, get better comebacks
---
Bruh emulators like BlueStacks also i think youre paired withbpc players only cuz i have teammates a 3K trophies meanwhile im at 6K
---
usually they have nothing for me
---
You can’t pass a 13:14 mark on any mode
---
Then stop pressing play again

God, the detail on this one is absolutely amazing. Not just the skin, but the entire piece itself. Nice job.
---
Also my phone (where i did took the pic cant Run BS properly)
---
...so wholesome... great job!
---
No wait i see it now
---
Dune drift is pretty fun. I see the complaints for solo showdown though. I am a teaser myself.... with my duos partner because I never play solo Showdown.

If I see someone choose Poco, I’ll attack that Poco instead.
---
I really miss it
---
Poco is balanced
---
Having to 1v1 someone for 8th place is one of the saddest things I've done in my life tbh.
---
I faced that every time when I use brawlers above 450
---
Where's Carl?
---
That is true. The rank 15 mark should be EARNED by competing against people for them, not by using cheap strategies like ambushing or teaming.
---
Pls get the 8k
---
yes
---
Now the post is gonna get stuck here cause everyone’s gonna want to keep it on 69 lol
---
Fortnite is a dead rat shit eaten by epic and shit again
---
Perfectly balanced, as all things should be lol. Don’t worry, there’s still 420
---
Well, ambushing is different from hiding all game. Bush *hunters* are playing the game and getting kills. Bush hiders might as well be afk.
---
Nice
---
I guess there’s nothing more to talk to you if you didn’t even watch the video.
---
Well,he is my only lvl 9...
---
Yeah,I feel his star power is pretty unimpressive,hope supercell buffs his SP
---
What is the rhinos head made out of?
---
Yeah tbh I would rather that than bono. Especially if I had him at power 10
---
Coins have two sides
---
That's amazing
---
#SHE PUNCHES!!! THATS WHY IT IS A PROBLEM!!!
---
In my opinion, teaming is still teaming. Instead of teaming, I just prefer to lose trophies or not play showdown.
---
Nah, that one area bottom of river right side is darryl central bc he can escape easy
---
Brawl Stars meets Pokemon. Nice.
---
Players should also get to choose one banned brawler. That would make things interesting.
---
Insane l
---
Its my fave, my darryl is 500 and going woooop I only use em on passage too
---
I got it :)
---
This is so true
---
What is the most optimum strategy for beating the difficult levels?
---
Buff ploko
---
Imagine if that was a goal 🤔
---
70 trophies in 3 battles? Smells like updog in here
---
How come you had the patience to wait 6 months to open boxes but not to wait until the Brock skin went on sale ? Lol weird.
---
I just don't trust him.
---
How
---
Ok I understand now what about rosa × ?
---
Nice work Flapjack! I like your drawings of ricochet as well, I miss him too.
---
The cubes should be shared because you still need to do damage, not only stay alive. If you're just running around, getting just a tiny bit of damage the boss will become stronger, so everything is important, dealing damage and staying alive. I hate people that have like 5 cubes and just run around killing smaller bots while i and my other teammate are trying to kill the bot while doing almost none damage to him
---
There was once a time.... You know what I'll just get sent to down vote hell for my opinion so, never mind.
---
Really true..........

I only saw a double jump at the end. Sorry

Oh, I am late then.

---
There's no better feeling than to backstab.... This made me laugh. Thanks!
---
Try rosa
---
such a fucking noob. Normally randoms like you sucks.
---
Thanks
---
but I have to balance it a little more
---
The left side isn't completely balanced
---
I mean you landed on the ground after every jump you did.....Only at the end you double jumped
---
K you have 1000 trophies so you can't understand. lmao
---
I know...
---
But he isnt barrel
---
Hmmmm
---
Because Epic knows what they are doing. (gets down voted)
---
Bu.. But its not like they're as intelligent as SuperCell no no no!
---
Entire SubReddit:"That was forced and thank you."
---
No, this was me playing as a random
---
What the fuck this is so dark
---
Sharing power cubes is by far the worst strategy ever. Just because the priority of the brawler who has all the power cubes is to stay alive, does not mean he can’t fight the boss. Just be extra careful that’s all.
---
I know that feeling when bots are better than actual people
---
Star power was secretly nerfed.
---
I love it!
---
Mods doing nothing, change my mind.

Say that to a majority to all gamers, because to "Real Gamers"

---
If you reach like insane 3+ this strtegy is the worst because the boss will go into god mode after a while and even with 10+ powercubes you won't be able to escape him (check a video or smth about god mode) if you're on like expert, master, then i agree, the strategy isn't so bad

You will get them soon, never give up.
---
Either i make or break, i decided what i would do
---
Okay. I was just wondering bc it had a timer in the shop but not the Brawler section
---
Lol spike is the most versatile legendary and the best one solely because he’s very good in a lot modes like gem grab brawl ball siege showdown etc and crow and Leon are mostly used in showdown 
---
Overall spike has more usage in all modes and that’s why he’s the best legendary in the game 
---
Many pro players have agreed to this as well that Leon after the nerf(s) is not as good as before and crow is only really good on showdown and nowhere else thus spike is the best legendary
---
Its 1%. What about 1 hp? It happend to me (twice)
---
Because it's easiest skill cap. Legit run up to somebody and tap the frick out of that right joystick. Plus these stupid Shelly think they can chain supers, super is harder to charge in real games so these idiots are randoms who have no idea how to play 3v3
---
Oh
---
You mean I'm 3v3 right?
---
At least you have won

My ign is el poco with crow picturr and if u join tje group"banae"tjere will be a el poco like i just said with around 1500 thropies

This has happened with me. It happens when your supercell ID is shared by two different people. (Your account is also connected to some other device...that’s why they locked it). You just have to contact the support and ask for all the guidelines. They will also tell you to to create a new email for your account’s Supercell ID and the previous email will be removed.
---
Just be calm and wait for a reply from support. 
---
Hopefully this helps you understand the matter and try to find out...which other device has your account connected to it. Also, the account will not be accessible from the previous email but from the new email. Be safe buddy!
---
Good Luck! 👍
---
Why does everyone want leon? Like seriously these 10K wannabes think you can get,Leon by using a 'command' all the 'How to get free legendaries' are fake; 1K people need to understand it's called LUCK
---
I see you delivered justice
---
Dynamike with star power is not that bad. I have seen a smart Dynamike who jumped at the right moment to dodge. However, I really hate people who use Piper in this mode.
---
oof yes
---
Yes zir
---
Ik, I'm just referring to now
---
lol nothing in brawl stars has to make sense

Y'all really go away from the middle?

Well done fellow comrade
---

---
Right? Everyone blaming about poco being underpowered but for me he is just fine (pushed him to 400 trophies)
---
Note: Duo Spawn Locations aren't Labled
---
Thye had us in the first half not gonna lie
---
And if you bushcamp you will die inside the bush anyways
---
Yep, they did indeed.
---
Not really though? Its only like 3-4 months since he got replaced by thicco (who's way better btw)
---
Ok?
---
Me okay 😒
---
Well i fucked up
---
What trophies are you actually?
---
No he doesn't. He has the highest move speed (and he becomes a Ferrari with star power) and very high damage. And he can stay alive for a very long time with that super.
---
Oh wait i Dont even have a voice
---
Buff Rico are you kidding me?
---
Filipino i see
---
But with the recent buff Rico does almost as much damage as Colt and he gets his super more frequently. Also, you can ricochet bullets using the map's borders, so not a bad option either. I think all three are better options than Primo.
---
That happened to me too 😥😥

I have a similar problem to you bro. I won the maple barley skin and everyone targeted me! Twice my teammates stood there spinning because they were so amazed, can’t they just play the game
---
Awww wow! 9 days, that was a while. Thank you so much and hopefully next post will be worth it.
---
This makes no sense. If u want to give assassins double damage, then it would make sense that heavyweight does less damage but gain health or smth for example. And u cant exactly apply these to everyone  becuase brawlers arent split to 3 groups, not that theres many good boss fight brawlers.

Why is everyone upvoting this white screen

You're random to other people too.

yes it’s counted,i don’t think it’s possible to jump continuously 7 times.

NoOOooOOoo!!!!!

There wre for 40 once

yes,double jumping as mike without touching ground is easy but I don’t think 7 jumps without touching the ground is possible,it’s probably only possible with only supers.im sorry if u think that ur pro and come here to criticise people if ur full of negativity then pls go away

For that he believes it, it's a map for primos ​​and rosas, it's body to body, that's why it's called a boxing zone, otherwise it would not make sense.

Yup

it Mortis

I always end up with a Shelly on boss fight, and it's always the Shelly that ruins the game. I can never get past insane 3 or 4 because I use all my tickets from Shelly taking cubes or suiciding

Not if you can't play him. Also, nobody cares about your trophies

I loved this video lol

I wanted to see the introduction of some subreddit on ONE post only. So I decided to drop mortis and to rank dynamike to make that post, so to see the reactions of 3 comunities on a simple post.
---
What are good brawlers in this mode
---
Actually, how much trophies do you have
---
I need Bibi and all of the legendaries
---
Because his power really just depends on the walls
---
Too bad we now have only Rico. I need Ricochet back.
---
I wasn’t thinking about that while opening, I just wanted a brawler

I'm a stranger on the Internet, so good.

Mankind for the win! (alien robots will die)

yea i know how it feels lol
---
I was hoping the crappy school wifi wouldn’t act up too much
---
That’s why I said either of them
---
Yeah but could be drawn better
---
Here's some possibilities.
---
1. He saw you go in the bush and predicted where you went.
---
2. Brock's main attack explodes at the end of its attack. The explosion is quite wide so it might have hit you.
---
3. He got lucky.
---
4. Another player is spectating him. Spectators can see everyone in the match. It's just a tiny loophole and something that isn't banworthy. Even if it's banworthy, I don't think it's possible to fix it.
---
5. Another player saw you and told him irl.
---
6. That one time when you accidentally walk out of a bush. It's only a first world problem tho.
---
Spin to win.
---
Thank you!
---
I like this make more post like tis
---
hiding behind obstacles wont work after furious because there wont be any obstacles left
---
Friendly games or nornal games?

what? yes, but that's a simple test to see 3 totaly differents reactions in 1. Maybe one day I could do more in-depth tests, but at that point I should concentrate on just one subreddit
---
There is no way
---
No, I think this should be in the Coach Cory's anti - teaming vidz. Btw Good Luck
---
that sucks. But at least you have 22 brawlers. i have like 9k trophies but only 20 brawlers

I learned that in Biology class.

That is clearly photoshopped

There were more at other points and some do remain in the files if I'm not mistaken.
---
I am struggling to keep my star-powered Poco over 300 because on gem grab he really depends on the team. Same with my tara level 9 stuck at 289. Usually at 400 it is easier to find skilled players which will play strategic and take advantage of Poco's star power. I am sure you are struggling with mortis because at 240 you can be matched with any type of player and when you get noobs in your team, then you can just wait to lose. It is all about passing that treshold after which you will be able to find medium-skilled players.
---

r/barleygang and r/throwergang are both nice, thrower gang is not very big yet.

2.5 big boxes in one week, multiplied by 5 weeks in a month gives 12.5 big boxes in a month, multiplied by 6 months I’ve been waiting would give 75, but I only played for 5 of those 6 months, so 62.5 big boxes.

That's just because you're all stupid high level for the trophies you're at, it's not the algorithms fault considering you're all at similar trophies, nothing against you and your teammates but that's honestly how the system is intended to work, I'm sure eventually you'll end up catching up in trophies and face more people similar in levels

Spike wants -7 trophies
---
Still wut
---
Would the voice actor reject money??
---
What is that?

You can take our headphones 👌😂

I feel though it would make more sense to make some sort of average between your level and trophies for matchmaking so stuff like this wouldn't happen...or just not have a leveling system in a game like this
---
Finally someone with a working brain

You have 500 followers!? I have only 24!

1st of all you're the dipshit: starpower leon with 300 trophies! Absolute BOT mf.
---
2nd you're an idiot cause you think matchmaking is based on power level lmao. What a clown
---
Nah if you want a skin buy it you cheapskate.
---
they looked absolutely fugly
---
I understand your point, however if you think about it if they had beaten you guys then that only probes they deserve the be at higher trophies than you, so it's a matter of attempting to balance skill with the positive feeling of leveling up characters you like and how their power level increases as you level them up(also, money). It allows the level 1 to 500 trophies runs etc. When you have really good people playing their still outweighs so much that level doesn't matter (granted that's a small minority)

---
100% this. If people got good team comps together and strategized, they’d win so much more than they lose in siege. I stupidly played 8 games with randos....lost 5 of them. Which means I’m minus 30 trophies overall. Then I got smart. Got a team together. Rolled 5 straight wins. Now I’m plus 20 and my penny is back in the top 100 United States where she belongs.
---
EVEN WHEN I DO GET THE BOX I GET NOTHING NEW. EVER. I'M AT 6K.
---
lol but just after i got bibi from a brawl box
---
😐🔫
---
Thanks, I’ve just had Bibi for like a month and haven’t seen a single one of these offers. All my other Brawlers are maxed and I want to spend my excess gold.
---
Nope. Not at all what I mean.

You missed the sarcasm from the post. I wIsH tHeRe wErE sUbFoRuM fOr ThAt

Its not, but supercell adds random categorizes like skirmisher and was bibi a batter?
---
I will now be referring to el primo as taco puncher and nothing else
---
I have and I’m trying to say there was no point in posting this. It’s irrelevant and no need for name calling
---
Got it. And so say once you drop back lower than 500 trophies, does it change again in your favor until you rise above it again?

The official subreddit is FortniteBR with 1 mil subs sorry about this
---
Perfect
---
Gem Carrier Mortis (June 2017) was honestly the best meta. No other meta has topped it whatsoever imo.
---
Hey, I found another longtime player! 
---
Ppl like you are so rare on the sub rn lol
---
*surprised happy Pikachu face*
---
Look great man😂👍
---
I already realized the sarcasm part before writing my comment. I just wanted to let you know.

Paint Tool SAI ☺

It's been 2 years? How long was it in beta?
---
I'm in the same situation, except I'm waiting for one for my lvl 8 Leon while I save boxes for update. I've usually gotten the offer within 2 weeks in the past.
---
Ok

You said you were a Mortis but you don’t have his flair, that’s what I meant
---
not original post
---
You should have supered away after leading the bot to the Shelly.
---
This is actually really cool but remember to have as few one block gaps as possible
---
The pucture is from early beta.
---
Gimme dat discount
---
Great artwork dude!
---
Solo is my fave
---
Heist is my favorite 3v3
---
Siege is next 
---
Brawl ball is my least favorite to play and watch but thats just me
---
I did, I was playing like I fell for it.
---
My dream is for a game similar to brawl ball, except maybe more refined. PvP football is all I want in this world. If I could make 1 video game, this would be it. And I’d do it for y’all brawl ball fans &lt;3
---
Cos of duplicate brawlers probabaly... 3 lvl 10 colts would wreck?
---
She is "only" insainly good. So ypu are right
---
Mortis gang, i have not heard that one in years.
---
Good good.
---
Definitely haha, DM me

New Character Concept For Brawlers: Qi
---
Introducing Qi! This mysterious young man from the East can cunningly and skillfully prove that balance is the key to peace of the body, the mind, and the soul.
---
Statistics: Note that the damage and hitpoints or anything else that may be varied through upgrades is based upon being Power One.
---
Rarity: Legendary
---
Brawler Type: Flanker 
---
Hitpoints: 3600
---
He is a mainly decent sharpshooter, only he can shoot at TWO DIRECTIONS at once. 
---
His Attack is called: Yin-And-Yang. 
---
His Super is called: Dance of the Eight Dragons.
---
His Star Power is called: Focus Chi
---
Let’s get on with the attack shall we?
---
Attack: Qi uses the power of complementary forces to use both of his hands at once, shooting both a whitish, yellowish ball of energy, and shooting at the same time a blackish, yellowish ball of energy. Whenever he attacks in a certain direction of your choice, he will also attack in the opposite direction! If both of his attacks hit, it doubles the fill of the Super bar!
---
He has a pretty thin range, just like Piper or Brock or Colt. His ammunition takes approximately 1.9 seconds to reload.
---
Super: Qi’s super may not deal much damage, but consider its full potential and it may be worth it if you have excellent aim.
---
Dance of the Eight Dragons: With total inner concentration, Qi can summon the full force of the eight fierce dragons, a gift given to him by a special spiritual being.
---
Upon using the Super, just like Crow shooting daggers in 14 directions, Qi will throw eight medium sized fast dragons in eight directions, covering decent amounts of space.
---
**Each Dragon will:**
---
· Exist with invincibility for three seconds.
---
· Will not destroy obstacles but instead, will pass through them.
---
· Each the size of three barrels together. 
---
· Deals 625 Damage for Power 1.
---
· Moves at a speed faster than Crow and Colt. 
---
Star Power: Focus Chi
---
The Eight Dragons have blessed Qi one day, and gave him a special healing power. Each time you manage to hit someone with a Dragon, Qi will automatically gain an additional 250 Health.
---
And with that being said, here are some possible voicelines for Qi if he gets added in:
---
**Upon Spawning:**
---
“All Brawlfare is based on deception!”
---
“我必须努力训练 !”(“I must train hard!”)
---
“I am Qi. East meets the West!”
---
“Before the fight of the fist, comes the fight of the mind.”
---
“是时候了！”(“It is time!”)
---
**Attacking:**
---
“感受志的力量!”(“Feel the power of Chi!”)
---
“Hi-Yah!”
---
“Yah-hi!”
---
“I must keep my illusion of control!”
---
“做好准备!”(“Get Ready!”)
---
**Killing an enemy Brawler:**
---
“I see I’ve done well.”
---
“I was expecting a challenge.”
---
“荣誉！(“With Honor!”)
---
(纯粹传奇的东西！(“The stuff of pure legend!”)
---
“谢谢!”(“Thank you!”)
---
**Getting hurt and damaged:**
---
“Huh!?”
---
“Yeaugh!”
---
“Doh!”
---
“我必须保持专注！” (“I have to stay focused!”)
---
“来吧。我可以战斗” (“Come on. I can fight!”)
---
**Upon Death**
---
“我也看到你练习艺术了!”(“I see you practice the art too!”)
---
“Daough!”
---
“You are truly a master.”
---
“我是宇宙中的一员”“I’m one with the universe.”
---
**Using Super:**
---
“See the Giant Dragons roar?”
---
“龙舞的时间！” “Time for the Dragon Dance!”
---
“You want my chi so bad?”
---
(Laughs in Chinese)
---
“Everybody likes Kung Fu fighting!”
---
Thank you for seeing my concept! It may be rubbish, but it is my first and I assure you that with time, I will improve.
---
Why??
---
But. On your total trophies you are ahead not in the hole, this is fake, c o n f i r m e d.
---
Good try!
---
Not that long time ago
---
This...does put a smile on my face
---
I wish the old Jessie icon was still here😭 it looked better
---
Thanks dude
---
What is this game?
---
It's fine, I won't, because you're given me your true answer.
---
I know I should be expecting comments like this because it is only my first Brawler Concept, but I hope when I post more Brawler concepts you can be sincere as you have been with this comment.
---
Bruh
---
You hace the replay? I want to see it :O!
---
For some reason, I knew that gene would be my first mythic ever since he was released. Was happy to get him from the free rewards for a change instead of getting 10 gold
---
I pushed him in Dune Drift too, took me 3 hours to get him to 500
---
LMAO I realize I have 200 more karma today
---
But do you want to add meh?
---
Sure. I will. And you won't regret it. Thanks
---
Tldr but cool, guess SC won't even consider adding this xd
---
S4W 
---
i'm not gonna lie, i'm kinda retarded, so can you explain
---
Archero
---
For a second I thought this was trying to be like the actual meme template but then, as a sharp pain pierced my heart, I realised.
---
Well Carl had basically two star powers so a little "adjustment" to the highest DPS character in the game isn't all that bad.
---
exactly, if they make it sso that the matchmaking pairs you up with similar levels, progressing in the game would have no purpose
---
Do you ever think "Humanity should've been extinct"?
---
if they make it sso that the matchmaking pairs you up with similar levels, progressing in the game would have no purpose what would be the point in leveling up
---
Add me plz
---
I will help
---
Got Leon Under 2K, Spike At around 2K, and crow at around 3.5K. When I got all the super rares, after some time I got Leon then the next brawler after about a week I got Spike. Still not a single Epic or Mythic, but 2 Legendaries in a row. Then a super long time passed when I didn't get a single new brawler. Then I get my first Epic - Bibi, then the in the next few days Gene, then Crow. Some time Later Pam. At exactly 4K Tara and now just got mortis.
---
explain
---
Lucky man
---
SCIENCE!
---
It’s Normal-Hard-Expert-Master-Insane-Insane II-XVI.
---
Nah because i havent spinned to team whit them
---
Because some people don't understand skill.
---
Excuse me?? I never team, im an anti teamer. Ur a dynamike so YOU team.
---
Gj man
---
Actually, supercell has got so many ideas from the community itself that they have to think which one to choose. Some ideas get upvotes because they look 'cool' and some don't because they are a bit 'complex'
---
... So, just wait, that's all I can say. I too quitted Making ideas. But because I knew I don't have that powerful idea to make it to game.
---
bull
---
Wat u mean :3
---
This is actually good
---
I got my first one at 3 or 4K on October 25, 2017, Spike. I got Crow at 6k on January 1, 2018. And I got Leon on the first day of his release, at 10k, after having saved up 300 boxes, it only took 70.
---
What about Chi is my name, Dragons are my game?
---
Pam/Poco/Nita/Mortis/Frank/Primo team 9/10 times I encounter them.
---
Removed - You have a negative karma score, please fix this before posting again. This action is to prevent spam on the subreddit.
---
Yep. It’s fake. I just checked, and the milestone where you get that Big Box is 7500 trophies, and he, or she, is at about 7200 trophies, but the milestone before 7500 is 7300 trophies. Still a good meme, though.
---
That crow needs an animation buff or change,a different color dagger buff animation would be nice
---
Great Idea
---
i got all superrares in 1.5k then got bibi then in 2 days (at 2.3k) i got all epics done. im at 3.2k trophys and still dont have mything or legendarys.                            and my friend got leon at 900 trophys ow my f\*\*\*ing god i hate supercell
---
Attention, that’s why they do it, they create brand new accounts to do so, Darius’ account was 6h old when he reposted witch jessie, his main account is still in this sub probably, so plz just ignore reposters, otherwise they’ll keep on doing this.
---
How come the last mine didn't trigger?
---
First off, keep calling me a bit even though you’ve never seen me play. Very intelligent roast. Secondly, please show me this 2k dude you’re so fond of, gaywad. If he plays better than an 11k, there’s a good chance he’s on an alt. Otherwise, you’re just delusional/a liar.  To me it sounds like you’re triggered. Just because one time you failed to comprehend your situation and ended up being pinched by teamers doesn’t mean you’d be +900 trophies. If that were the case I’d be at 13000 by now, lmao. And have you ever heard of backstabbing? Or juking? Or rotating? If you’re gonna play sd, quit complaining about things you can easily avoid. There’s a reason you barely ever see pro players getting annihilated by 7 teamers. If there’s even just 4 teamers, it’s best to just spin to betray. And to me it sounds like you rely solely on showdown like a true noob. That’s the only mode that is relatively RNG dependent. No wonder you lose 3v3s with randoms. You’re the problem. And in this game you control your movement, your aim, and when you attack. I don’t understand how you have a hard time 1v2ing. That’s a vital skill in 3v3s and all it requires is precision and mind games. Like every 5 games of brawl ball I end up 1v3ing to stalk the opponents because both my teammates die and it’s not even that difficult. You’re just bad at the game. 
---
And if you want I can dominate you in a friendly 1v1. Maybe that’ll knock some sense into your noob ass brain.
---
Discord tag: @╰( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡° )つ──☆*・ﾟ#7980
---
Looks cool, but also kinda scary, cuz it kinda looks like she ripped of their heads😂
---
Lol how’d you get Brock next to your name?
---
Out of those, only Primo and Mortis really team for me. *Maybe* Pam.
---
If you talking about double jump, some skilly guys can do 4/5 jump in a row, not new
---
It's not only kills that get you star player, and people would still go for the objective cause you got to win to get a chance at star player, or draw.
---
Yeah, they team more often probably. Dynamike team as well on one specific map but those 3 always team. I just don’t push on showdown :p. Throwers are way stronger in heist and siege after all.
---
Thanks..
---
Yeah, I play a lot of Dyna but refuse to team.
---
technical limitaions to what 🤨
---
You dont know that
---
love that you put this on a gif lol
---
Same. But I almost never play showdown competitively because it is so inconsistent.
---
Spike is a nut
---
r/inclusiveor
---
What happened to the last mine?
---
Congrats!
---
I want this to be a friendly game map just so i can mess with bibi and rico on it

At the subreddit you can choose i forgot but go to main page is somewhere there
---
Great. Another thing from a Brawl Box that I'll never get.
---
The shop.
---
I am at 10,5k.
---
Hi at 10,5k., I'm dad.
---
I skipped over all of that, I read like..the first 3 sentences XD.
---
1) IM NOT TRIGGERED THIS IS HOW I DEBATE, shit didnt even know I had caps on not gonna delete it though, that's too much work XD.
---
2) Some of them may be alts but not my friend XD hes at 2.5k(lenny) and my other friend is at 11k(trevis), me and lenny win against trevis quite alot(not together of course I'm talking 1 v 1)
---
I have about 30 "friends" who are at 8k+ and I guarantee that half if not more of them cant beat lenny. Because we had a tourney. 
---
3) you say I haven't seen your gameplay but u also haven't seen mine.
---
I dont have discord but u can give your team code and I'll join
---
They are nothing compared to the sniper bot who can shoot behind walls
---
I do I'm just playing with randoms but like I say my brawlers probably aren't powered up enough and I'm relatively new so I wouldn't want to bring you down man! That level must be crazy difficult. Are the rewards even worth it? Tbh I don't see the point in this game mode if it's so impossible and you don't get rewards along the way.
---
I miss this
---
I said the post suffers. She deserved that buff, she also deserved another buff. If you have 15 PC or you use the energy drink good you deserve to win. In this picture it kinda looks like that only Shelly has accese to those powers if you know what I mean. Powercubes and energy drink doesn't make her OP. Everyone can pick them up. You say that she is only  good in SD and she sucks everywhere else. Why would you complain about a buff she got then? Everyone has problems against that one brawler. I get this but this post does a shitty job to reflect your own opinion.
---
I dont think we will ever see, but maybe if a skin comes that shows his face, we can see. I think leon is cool now, with his hoodie :3
---
Just to be kill by teaming shellys
---
(like why on earth does a shelly of all people need to team)
---
The corner lakes are big trouble in competitive games. You have to re-design those lakes.
---
Hmm this just reminded me of Nightwolf 
---
r/MortalKombat
---
Bear
---
Dragon
---
Yeah, and it could fire one big bullet that splits into smaller ones!
---
This is way too good. Great job!
---
Yea just for thrower
---
We need custom sound effects
---
I read it first as “IQ”
---
You're right
---
For me to replay any levels below Insane IV doesn’t cost any tickets, so it doesn’t affect me in any way haha. Ill be down to help you just send me your team code.
