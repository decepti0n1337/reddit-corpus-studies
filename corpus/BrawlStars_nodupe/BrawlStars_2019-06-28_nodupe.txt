For me this update killed a lot of the fun.
---

---
1- Siege had its flaws, but I found it OK. Now it's crap, whoever attacks first wins the match, it's totally focused on the first 30s kills
---
2- Tick sucks: too long range and too good auto aim, unclear blast radius, new brawler hysteria
---
3- Hated Sunstroke, especially filled with ticks
---
I hope these things get fixed soon.. /:
---
I think Supercell might have done this intentionally so it isn't crazy op in big game or showdown.
---
What's the problem here? You guys willingly went with a lower brawler, it goes based off off highest, not average...
---
Huh?
---
If a square has a number on it, that number of bombs is around that square(including diagonally)
---
Underrated

My memory is a bit bad but Minesweeper works roughly like this:
---
#Objective of the game
---
The objective of the game is to find all tiles that does not have a mine in it. Mines are placed on random tiles and your job is to not explode. All tiles are hidden at the beginning of the game. Since all tiles are hidden at the beginning of the game, it is possible to lose on your first click.
---
#How do I play?
---
Clicking on any tile will reveal it, revealing a blank tile, a numbered tile, or a mine. If you reveal a blank tile, it will reveal the tiles around it, continuing until it reveals a tile(s) with a number on it (at least it does this in the version I played). 
---
Right clicking (at least in my version) marks the tile with a flag. This is usually used to help you remember which tiles you think is a mine. It does not actually do anything though.
---
#The numbers, Mason! What do they mean?!
---
A tile with a number on it tells you how many mines is in the tiles next to it, either directly next to it or diagonally from it. A 1 means there's a mine in one of the 8 tiles around, 2 means 2, and so forth.
---
#What happens if I click on a tile with a mine?
---
You lose.
---
100 keys?
---
The regular attack, explosive shells or sea urchins... Super, the head is thrown and becomes a mini-crab.

Idk dude I don't see why not. I bought Shiba Nita on a whim and do not regret it :)
---
will it work if there are actual players? wanna troll my friends
---
Well it maybe they did but then they should at least make it consistent with the description.
---
You bastard
---
No. That‚Äôs how it should work. You wanna try and carry a low power brawler that‚Äôs on you.
---
Lmao
---
The star tokens should have been added on with the box points
---
The brawler requirement should have Been 300 for star points to be collected each season. 
---
They should have not changed the trophy progression. 
---
Siege was meant to be the big scary mode. Keep it that way. 
---
The star powers were a knock out of the park, nice job supercell. Although some are op/outshine others.
---
I've pushed Mortis to 500 twice, then another 400 on one of my smaller accounts. I've played this game for 2 years. There is nothing wrong with your game at all and this is pointless...
---
The ghost noises translate to

---
I assume this is a joke but without a bolt carrier it would seem quite difficult to consistently get bolts, especially against long range brawlers like Pam or Bo

I didnt want to carry that noob
---
Cavern Churn is a fun map but not a good ranked map at all... It should be only brought back to friendly games
---
Keep grinding! I have 7800 so I cannot afford the 10k, either. But I'm working on getting my first brawler to 500
---
Except for ticks super, that destroys mortis-‚Äòbringer of doom‚Äô
---
Penny was then. And if that‚Äôs the case, then yes. They need to fix this. You shouldn‚Äôt be punished if you queued in by yourself.
---
Okay here‚Äôs a tip for your following memes
---
stop this lost in new shit it‚Äôs dumb and this was a good meme but title makes me want to downvote
---
We need more mods stat. Stupid posts like this are flooding new...
---
Way too many walls... Maybe removing some walls on the edges and the ones near spawn would help this map be more balanced. I personally like the idea of a bushless map tho
---
Can you draw mecha Bo and Crow like how you did Rico?
---
Allllll the mini-mines
---
Thanks.

[sad f2p noises]

This has been posted SO MANY TIMES. EVERYONE KNOWS THIS.
---
But skins are just cosmetic, they don't change the gameplay so they aren't necessary to be competitive. I am at around 11k trophy playing since late December last year and my highest level brawls aren't even halfway to level 9. Star powers can be unlocked without paying, but realistically it will probably take me a few more months to even get my first one.

The new siege doesn‚Äôt reward control because the game time is shorter and the Ike has lower hp. In fact it rewards aggressiveness more, because the new ‚Äòstrategy‚Äô is to destroy the Ike with the 1st robot push.
---
Mm hmm
---
That's just his head. Wonder why supercell didn't model the full body for this. Loving the Mario style tho
---
Hey boy, the skins made by supercell are also inspired by the community...
---
u/kirin_08 made a Mecha crow skin idea too... And supercell did implement some of the skins..  ask yourself, don't you like 'em?
---
Wait, Brawl Stars is our game?
---
This completely explains the chaos going on in the low trophy area
---
No
---
Well. you aren't wrong

I am xD

No skins are stupid and doesn‚Äôt increase skill or playing style

Supercell Support: Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii Player 123!  Omg, I also hate it when throwers throw the game!  Have I told you about my life story?  I once ran a tree house club and pushed my friend off by accident but he was okay.  So we ate smores and had a good time.   I also wonder about the time I saw the moon and my dog howled like a wolf - very scary!  So yes, we value great players like you and recommend that you use strategy to counter the throwers by throwing the game first!   Thank you for contacting Supercell Support.   &lt;fistbump&gt;    - Steve, Hardcore Brawler, Support

Apparently it's not Tara's voice. It's the third eye speaking.

They shoyld have it so you can buy normal boxes and big boxes with them

How could you betray your own kind
---
tbh I hat passage more cos of the long range brawlers teaming up at the middle of the map. Canvern Churn at least stops the noob long range brawlers players to team up and get trophies for 24 hours.
---
He most likely was
---
Most op skin because he's the second who can say the n-word
---
*incert PewDiePie camera meme here*
---
Skins bought from star points will be used to show off others how you push your trophies and how good are you in the game... The more expensive skin, the note star points you get
---
I love this sp so much
---
Dammm thats hot
---
Cursed video
---
Well, what happened?
---
"well I'm not changing"
---
Yes but they don‚Äôt add a bonus in att hp or speed or anything except clothing to the brawlers...
---
Actress
---
Bob is better in my opinion
---
No I will do what I want
---
Poco will now deal 1200 damage when he uses his super on the enemy.
---
That means he can heal his partners,and deal damage to the opponent at the same time.
---
Auto brawlers- roll out!

And increase it by 100%

I think they literally are.
---
I just used it because that‚Äôs what everybody else calls them
---
CRITTERS
---
Literally never noticed.
---
To be clear, not talking about the coins waiting to be collected, talking about the Bo that‚Äôs coming after that. That‚Äôs really always been there?
---
Honestly I didn‚Äôt really understand what I was typing so it‚Äôs ok
---
At 0 trophies he's going to be playing against ticks almost constantly lol
---
Actually, nothing really changed, the third eye is the only change
---
im gonna steal it and make it better and get 2 upvotes watch me!
---
So we gotta be honest? Were kind of retarded? Or am i trippin
---
Well look at notlando‚Äôs post that is similar to mine. Go argue with him. We both made memes, and they both turned out to be alike. But u/notlando‚Äôs went viral
---
I can see lots of creativity with Darryl for lines and in a Robotic Pirate Voice. I have some good example lined right now:

---
Like my ideas?
---
I kind of remember that They said they will not give voice to spike . But I hope It was just a trol or unreal somethink
---
We‚Äôre both kinda retarded
---
I wasn‚Äôt specifically calling you out. We just had this debate in my club today. And what about people who spend money but only to buy skins? Are they pay to win? They‚Äôre not free to play. It‚Äôs all silly to me.
---
The best team right now
---
Hilarious.
---
Agreed
---
Still... Nothing to be found.
---
But, Ik this is just a meme, so. Whatever
---
So stop criticizing great ideas. Mine is obviously great, because someone else did it and it got viral
---
K
---
Thanks
---
Ok thanks
---
And your point is absolutely and 100% true.
---
Bob
---
I never criticized your idea. Lol, are u crazy?
---
I just said that there's no Tara or Leon skin. That's all
---
Well at least bibi didn't get that "_my name,_ is my game" dialogue
---
Yay?
---
Nvm. I said nvm!!
---
Yes i have tried still the projectile goes all the way up
---
Why does every post say something like: ‚Äúi hope there isn‚Äôt another similar meme‚Äù .. am I missing a joke or something?
---
Oh u want to find the mines. Makes sense.
---
I said nvm. I just don‚Äôt want my meme to flop because of a comment
---

I‚Äôve spent like a hundred bucks USD since February and was fighting the deadline at 3885 trophies before Tick was released. Swing and a miss. I tilted much and dropped like 70..haha. I have like 7 star powers activated, waiting to pull Primo from a box. The money I spent helped to get ‚Äúhere,‚Äù but that doesn‚Äôt meant I have decent bankroll management skills in place regarding my trophies. Oh, fo‚Äô sho. Fml..
---
I don‚Äôt know what the percentage is, but app developers absolutely pay to be in the App Store. There‚Äôs a reason every single app has either adds, micro transactions, or costs money up front. If the App Store paid developers to be in the store, there would be way more ad free truly free apps.
---
How did you do this?
---
This one seems kinda less worse
---
Haven‚Äôt seen anyone play tick on showdown so phew
---
Thank you!
---
sure

I don‚Äôt need police Carl to stop people stealing art from me because it‚Äôs not good enough to be stolen
---
You guys looked cool as hell together. Wish I had enough star points for one
---
Nevermind. The mushrooms are fixed . I guess..
---
We need a remodel of the remodel.
---
Yeps
---
&lt;3
---
Haha, Hopefully I am
---
This happened to me too lol, except it was Bo instead of Bibi
---
Uh oh. I got my Dynamike to 700 today. You should try to push him too. :)
---
Interesting
---
Any Brawler can use Bull's rage ability
---
Sure, maybe I'll upload it later
---
I didn't even realize she got remodeled to be honest. She looks completely identical.
---
Well you know some people have better luck than others
---
Maybe later i will push him
---
no u
---
What about Carl‚Äôs minecart
---
yes I know that but I wanna be a healer like gene
---
I have 13k star points just waiting for Night Mecha Crow 
---
cuz that Gold one is too expensive.
---
Gene‚Äôs not a healer. His star power barely heals. But I see what you mean
---
Person : Knocks on the door
---
Frank: RAAAAA
---
Showdown, I pushed mine to 500 on dune drift which is actually to tomorrow
---
Yup terrible change.  At least tokens could give you gems.  Now you might get a couple hundred star tokens towards stuff that costs 50k star tokens.  Both would be reasonable, but supercell always seems to want to take something away whenever they give :/
---
Alright I‚Äôll try
---
Removed - DO NOT SUBMIT POSTS WITH TITLES IN ALL CAPS. CAPS LOCK IS CRUISE CONTROL FOR COOL
---
what's he gonna be the cameraman for tho üòè
---
matchmaking shouldn‚Äôt put 2 players that are 400 trophies apart in the same game. They should be about 100 trophies up or down
---
Ohhh
---
To do this just refer to https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/c66x8f/cool_friendly_match_glitch_where_you_can_kill/ and instead of (poco -&gt; bull) use (penny -&gt; tick)
---
How‚Äôs that going to work?
---
I feel that her remodel being feminine was forced, I preferred when she didn‚Äôt felt feminine because I feel as if she wouldn‚Äôt be focus in battles and more or so be focused on other feminine things
---
You summarized it perfectly holy hell
---
Super can heal teammates and damage enemies.
---
lol i haven't seen this meme in a while
---
3.5k  
---
Every brawler except tick and the legendarys
---
Day and night do not dwell together.
---
Better ask the allies to go and stay near the enemies so that I can shoot both of them with my super
---
Can the bomb see leon, when leon activates his super?
---
Lol. They could do that, but it wouldn't fix much. The main problem is trophy based matchmaking is a terrible idea.
---
There's a logical conclusion to most squares in a typical game. Guessing is only required rarely in the endgame
---
i don‚Äôt see a feasible way to do skill based matchmaking
---
I like it! Looked so good I thought it was legit
---
I think in future we will see more Chromas ! This are just the first!
---
It will take a long time and a lot of work but that's the point. The skins are meant to be super exclusive. It's all about flexing. 
---
Your math isn't wrong but I think you are missing some points (bad pun, I know). 
---
What you don't mention is that with the changes to the trophy system it is easier to gain trophies for each brawler; up to 700 trophies if I recall correctly. By easier, I mean losses are now weighted less across the ranks up to 700 trophies. That should help people accumulate star points by reaching rank 20 easier and then pushing 500+. The way I like to think about it is that this is power (trophy) creep and therefore 700 trophies is the new 500 trophies.
---
Another big thing you don't mention is that Supercell has been pretty good about adding new brawlers. They've been adding a new brawler about every 5-6 weeks since global and they'll probably continue to do so. New brawlers = more star points from getting them to rank 20 and then pushing them 500+.
---
Increases like 0,0030 and every Brawler you get will drop the rate üíô
---
Agreed, have an upvote!
---
Or Tara is indeed the girl but she is being possessed by something
---
Im assuming its gonna be a demonic robo voice sound
---
*lights torch and sharpens pitchfork*
---
Just bad luck, I‚Äôm at 11.6k and I‚Äôm missing an epic
---
But wait. Bull and Shelly in this scenario are teamed. That innocent mike who was all alone died to two dirty teamers.
---
Parab√©ns ae man
---
Matchmaking is horrible now. 100 trophies or less are playing against 300+ trophy brawlers. And it takes forever to find a game too! awful
---
I WANT ONE
---
Well, now if next month its like that i will be sure its a bug.
---
Its still op tho right?
---
Good job, I like it.
---
I can imagine the mines spelling out ‚Äúspam‚Äù on the floor.
---
Not to live for fun
---
The real question is, how is it possible that two dynamikes attacked each other rather than spin?
---
I still advocate that Penny‚Äôs cannon should be Kenny instead of Lenny. You still get the rhyming aspect but with the ‚ÄúK/hard C‚Äù sound from cannon.
---
I actually feel like Star Players gets awarded correctly most of the time.
---
When I play a game, I can always guess who gets Star Player. Either me, or my teammates. It's actually really often the person who performed best.
---
Though it might be because I play at 500+ so people don't just run in for kills
---
True, but shelly cant get in the bushes without her super without guaranteeing -7 trophies
---
At 99%
---
#EEEEEEEELLLLLLL PPPPRRRIIIIIMMOOOOO
---
No? It just was an honest question since I have been playing since global and still I got attached to the old tara model because I like playing her and I just wanted to know if newer players liked it less
---
Considering that I didn't ask the question correctly I understand your toxic view on it and I apologise for the missunderstanding
---
Here's an F for the quality of my image.
---
Oh my god
---
This isn‚Äôt a concept,the skin is in the files stop lying
---
Huh, I see you are a man of culture as well

2 of this sub's memes combined into one video. An extraordinary sight to behold!!
---
You love games
---
Posts that deserve to be on top
---
Contact support my dude
---
This is exactly right and that's why we don't award anything for Star Player. We want to make sure that people are playing the objective, and not playing for Star Player. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
It would really suck to have matches where El Primo just runs to the enemy spawn to try and get the most damage taken.
---
Yeah, that‚Äôs how I got the music
---
Buff Mortis (-_-)
---
Nerf Dynamike (0v0)
---
upload on youtube
---
Congrats, I'm trying to do the same thing (Currently at 471)
---
Yeah we need more Star points! This would help the players who don't have 500+ brawlers
---
That's on the files
---
How would you even nerf tick? Health nerf?  Probably a range nerf
---
That‚Äôs great
---
They added it back.
---
Wait they changed bridge to far? The hiest map that piper is good on? NOooooooOOo
---
Tara might be a Mideast girl
---
Not at all what I wanted to say with this question
---
Anyone can be good if they try hard enough and I stand by that, I just generally wanted to know if newer people got less attached to the old model maybe because they have played it less
---
I am sorry that this question was not asked in a way where you could see my intentions of learning about opinions on first sight
---
Good thing because rico was basically on life support
---
Absolutely not. Those star point skins are flex skins.
---
Mecha Bo and Mecha Crow look beautiful together, especially the White and black ones.
---
Arat
---
Its still as fast as an enraged seige bot
---
Ok thanks for your honest answer ^ :)
---
Yeah, I think I'm going to use his first star power for Cavern Churn in the future.
---
For the record, I absolutely hate throwers, and mortis.
---
Sorry, meta.
---
Balancing 3 at a time so the game doesn't completely break ;)
---
Just wait for Crow remodel and it will be even better
---
Uhh you‚Äôre missing out the fact that if you have rank 15 dyna and above no team will huddle together
---
yeah but my first match i went into to get the star token idk how there was like no shellies or bulls i killed a dyna early game then when its top 3 i killed a no power cube bo then 7 power cube bo we killed eachother at the same time and it said Defated but then i got #1 idk how
---
Some people downvoted you for having an opinion I also liked the old model also I have a question how do you get Tara behind your name
---
 Nita is clearly not auto aiming
---
Oh my god why do people still create weird tier lists
---
The Nita buff that we deserve

To do this just refer to¬†/r/Brawlstars/comments/c66x8f/cool_friendly_match_glitch_where_you_can_kill/¬†and instead of (poco -&gt; bull) use (darryl -&gt; mortis)

---
whatever
---
This is because they want it to be easier to push your brawlers to 500 easier so that you could get the star points. I'm just saying what I can
---
Yes please

For brock it literally says 300 but for shelly  they said full health

I hope someone can confirm this

No problem yikes, opinions are valid.

Well that‚Äôs Rico‚Äôs map
---
He shots laser like terminator üòÖüòÖüòÖüòÖ
---
Frank's stun is nerfed in big game, shelly's star power will be nerfed too as a big brawler...
---
I cant Read it plz help
---
–ò–û–≠–ì
---
the old starpower was actually probably a nerf at times when trying to stack up for super
---
What did they do to seige??
---
All you had to do was buff the damn crow supercell
---
Bro u can watch brawl talk again
---
He said  ‚ÄúNo you can get tick in 4000 trophies‚Äù
---
Removed. Keep your post titles descriptive and provide context. Additionally do not use low effort/all caps/clickbait titles.
---
How does that make sense did you mean it attacks twice as fast?
---
Yes
---
I like it
---
Possibly
---
Basically using a glitch to swa] brawler SP, check out my other comment on this post to do it yourself.
---
i dun have tara so pls tell me she still has that respect losing animation
---
I agree, but how would that work for showdown?
---
I'd rather not cheat honestly
---
what did u get
---
It would be funny if Tick‚Äôs attack destroyed walls and grass.
---
Ah ok
---
1 tile gaps uhhh
---
Cry with me i am playing from android release and i am f2p at 9.7k and i still missing gene and bibi too not counting spike because he is legendary
---
I have explained it in other messages.
---
But for instance: 3 star points for 1st position, 2 for the 2nd and 1 for the 3rd. So that will make people fight more and not teaming that much.
---
they are delusional to think that this abomination of a skin is worth 300 gems
---
I have observed that the third skin (from left) blinks. No matter the brawler.
---
Basically it would take 2.5 years to be able to purchase the skins that cost 50,000 star points and that's if you play 24/7.and if you are a pro and like idk what kind of magic you have you could do it in half a year. 
---
Now this is not a complete FACT it's just an estimation.
---
tbf it was nice to be able to check all skins and try them..
---
That's bcs you ranked carl at rank 10
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇ, this is a good one bro.
---
I'm fine, that my map somebody likes.

5 may be too much, maybe 2/3?

I'm not, I got it from big purple box...
---
No becouse i got the same shitty offer
---
He will shoot videos
---
depressing
---
Where's the goal??
---
Agreed... but how about Bibi?
---
Also star shelly cannot be obtained with starpoints... I understand that but just sounds wierd
---
Fuk no you can't even play on the map well
---
I like this robotic theme, too
---
I was wrong about this but i had a good prediction in my opinion
---
same, don't look at my flair i play other brawlers too
---
CuRsEd image
---
they said that you can get star points in season end or by run-up brawlers
---
Some star powers in big game was nerfed for boss like barley regenerate only 30 hp not 300 so don't worry
---
So poco just has a 4th stronger attack
---
Hej

deals

I runked up many time  and didnt got any thing

Because it‚Äôs a sign of skill, dedication, and perseverance. There will be very few who will unlock the golden skins, and that is for a reason: to give OG beta players a goal and a reason to continue pushing. 
---
P.S. I‚Äôm not a beta OG player, I‚Äôm free to play and have been playing since global and will probably never get those skins but I still understand why supercell would make the decision to price them that high.
---
10000 star points? You are good
---
Thanks! :)
---
I highly doubt these numbers. I‚Äôd like to see your math please.

Technically you can got 120 gems from a single big box
---
also got 12, look at my post. Congrats btw
---
Just as good as the other stuff in the series. Good work!
---
If this were to be added then the way you get star player would have to be tweaked

Yes it is a bad template for this

i opened more than a 100 boxes and got 47
---
Nerfing Dynamike would be an indirect nerf to Mortis.
---
You should have bolder do not clump up
---
Barley, I need to spin just to reach rank 20. Sorry for that, I really need to get the 300 star points.
---
The star player is a mix of damage, kills, heals, damage taken, getting killed and completing the objective. The problem is that it doesn't count crowd control and more importantly it doesn't consider risks. If an Darryl with 5 stars in bounty on the last 10 seconds with 2 star in lead rolls to the 3 enemies and somehow beats them, he will be starplayer more likely, even though not a single person would call him starplayer for doing an unnecessary move that could have costed the game. If the starplayer gets awarded with more than a little exp there will be more of these situations.
---
*these women
---
Well, I didn‚Äôt see those, but the rest is fine. 
---
BTW, you don‚Äôt have to downvote anybody with opposing opinions, that‚Äôs just straight up toxic.
---
lol thats what I thought, the only people I saw complaining about Cavern Churn being gone were Thrower, Tank, Rico and maybe Bo mains
---
You spelled ruin wrong. If they hadn‚Äôt ruined it, I‚Äôd have done it a lot quicker.
---
Kinda cringe
---
In Big game she heals less than 5040 hp.
---
BO MAINSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
---
 2 of them. Did they rush mid?
---
I don't really team, but I just want to reach 500 for that star points.
---
Do y'all know how hard is to make those 3d models? It's like asking for a present but you refuse it!
---
Because that‚Äôs normal. Jesus. Move along.
---
True
---
True, Tara's eye looks really dead
---
It looks so weird When they are The wrong way!
---
But my teammate kept on dying.
---
even if you team on purpose I dont blame you, its the easiest strategy to """progress""" in the game. Sure, when you stop teaming you'll be pretty bad and you might lose lots of 3v3 games because of it but its just a "consequence" of SD teaming
---
yeh thats good
---
brawl stars clans dont do anything
---
Stop making low efford posts
---
I think the other piper rushed mid
---
If they kept the old siege and reduced the rewards given I'm actually fine imo
---

nooooo

PASSAGE
---
the map where u used darryl to super across the river to get away
---
can we get an f
---
Yeah the other two are pretty impossible to obtain
---
I kinda agree. Though it's so annoying when someone follows you the whole map. But I guess that'd be your problem for not being skilled to throw 'em off so they stop following you.
---
Lol great first meme
---
But lets say you are playing brock and brock can spot the bull or shelly from so far
---
Its nerf, or nothing
---
There is only 2 paths of 1 case wide. I don't like it because it's unplayable except for Penny and Jessie.
---
Dies
---
-500 out of 10
---
I agree I loved it before, despite the loss of trophies it was a super fun game mode. Now it feels rushed, if you die once you lose the game, Mortis is OP as fuck because the only thing that matters is getting the first 3 bolts.
---
I know lmao 
---
But he looks cool thou : )

It totally make sense to me

Thats potato mine from PvZ
---
The advantage of getting kills is power cubes, other than that kills don‚Äôt matter unless it‚Äôs the last kill.
---
+
---
But I like the new tara...I think its one of the best remodels. The worst one (in my opinion) was rico...they ruined my boi üò≠üò≠
---
That Darryl killed that bo though
---
That's fair, but unless they fucked up they'd stay in the bushes all game and they'd be right on top of you without you even knowing until it was too late
---
Star points are meant to be an end game currency so I don't think this will be implement
---
r/lootstars
---
wooooosh
---
 
---
why dont you mentioned in datamine post about 3rd star powers on some brawlers?  
---
like bi bi, carl, mortis, shelly, bull and  poco
---
Mine is 37 lmao
---
Imagine if it was a platinum
---
Yo Jessie should move up atleast 1 tier
---
Isn‚Äôt the point for the good skins to be rare?
---
spickle
---
Me when I first started playing the game
---
Supercell will simply look at the replays or matches
---
BRO, IM OG BUT I HAVENT GOT THIS SKIN
---
Every. Fucking. Time... BUT I gotta be honest...I still dont like ricos remodel, and I never will be liking it... all the other remodels are perfectly fine and I didnt complain about them...
---
We could add a few gaps...BTW thanks for suggesting... this is the first time I have ever made a map.
---
Haha so true
---
Mortis and dynamike
---
He means to just put the code into a box instead of having to go to their channel and click a link.
---
I know but maybe if your star player
---
Nah I do gain something. I‚Äôm being toxic and get slight enjoyment out of the fact this conversation is still being continued, meaning i can just do it to the rest of your comments tbh...
---
im actually kinda surprised you haven‚Äôt blocked me (yet)
---
Yeah...I like every other remodel, but that rico one...I just cant stand it...
---
Thanks Colt, very cool
---
Sorry dude. I don‚Äôt think this is a necessary change
---
Ow ok
---
Next will be piper or pam
---
i love the map
---
I play every single day. Never missed a star point
---
I hate u bruh bot
---
It will piper probably
---
5k for normal is easily affordable tho
---
teamers, like third partiers and powercube stealers, are bug opportunists, i may not like them, but i do respect the fact that they act like that, taking an opportunity when they see it

How could you robots are able to nut

I agree with you, this would be a GREAT addition to the game :)
---
I almost have 7000 and don't have Bibi, Gene and Crow
---
They look like freaky sewer robots.

If this used on primo ( he won‚Äôt die when jump to bullllll )

"Cros has been locked in a suit due to his toxicity"
---
You mean "League of Legends has been locked in a suit due to it's toxicity"
---
Well it is either a bug in the function or a typo in the wording. What I said is related to your reply to my post...
---
Look, it says "return to full hp". I think full hp means full hp, not 5040 life. If you look at any other game (for example in dota 2 cheese returns it to full hp), even if you increase your health it still brings you to FULL hp. I believe that this is the correct intuitive way of interpreting the wording. Of course am exception should be made for boss mode.
---
You say that full hp simply refers to 5040 hp, the amount of hp of the original Shelly. Even if you believe this, then the word "returns to" in the star power description would be wrong because she isn't "returning to" 5040 hp, she is simply GAINING 5040 hp. 
---
If Supercells intention is for her to recover 5040 hp then that's fine but they should reword the wording of the star power.
---
Make a anime outro.
---
I don't want to flex but I'm F2P too and I've got all brawlers except Spike
---
How about Spiper?
---
Choose nita, choose second SP, then choose Jessie and quickly start game
---
Frank too
---
You are right

I noticed first time i heared the song :P

Screeching solo is better option for solo showdown because da capo is useless in solo showdown but screeching solo is way more useful

Nani is the Japanese way for saying ‚Äúwhat?‚Äù It was popularized from anime subs where a character (or some being) will yell the phrase.

---
then you‚Äôre part of the reason that sub has gone to shit
---
Ah the bringer of bats? Okay
---
Ok then ƒ± was wrong sorry
---
I think 5 is way too much just for being the star player... just 1 or 2 is fine... otherwise people over 500+ trophies on a brawler would complain
---
Wow what a original joke that totally hasn't been used a billion times
---
Nani is the Japanese word for ‚Äúwhat?‚Äù It was popularized by characters (or some other sort) in anime (subs) yelling out the phrase.
---
Thank you for the compliment.
---
First off that won't get you over 500. Second that's boring as fuck. Why even play the game if you play like that? It's supposed to be fun.
---
Nosir I play solo only duo showdown is fuc up with the trophie rewards
---
Look at he game, stupid
---
Nita
---
Dude they did a lot more than changing a bit it look. They made a whole new model of tara with smoother animation and model. They where unable to do that with OG tara without rewriting all again.
---
Yeah teamers will kill you
---
well you can get bo
---
Now I shall continue my crusade
---
I‚Äôve been in like 10 showdowns of all ticks

Outdated. Supercell wants to remodel El Primo, Pam, Crow, Piper and slightly Penny amd Frank if I remember correctly
---
so funny xd
---
Hmmmmmmm
---
Put firecrackers on the head and then make a drone to kill darryl
---
Yay
---
It is actually about writing some comments or posting something in other language and I think this is stupid because no one can umderstand what you say but it wasn't even important
---
It's LOVE, Don't you know Underground rules?
---
Very interesting
---
That doesn‚Äôt mean he needs a buff. He was ranked as one of the worst not because he was weak, but because the meta was stacked against him. 
---
Some of the strongest and most used brawlers in the game have high health and act as strong counters to him. On his own, Mortis is fine, but throw in a few high health characters who need a nerf, and he starts to suck.
---
Then why did it for 6x more upvotes than before? Sometimes, the time we post Also affects the popularity...
---
I agree with the creature of the night
---
r/cursedcomments
---
Cringy af, please stop
---
Also Jessie slightly
---
Right that's interesting and makes sense because they are older brawlers. And I have noticed that on  bunny penny, there's clipping issues with the ears so hopefully they fix that too.
---
Guys don‚Äôt worry she has her #Band-aid
---
But if you believe in the heart of the cards, you can win. 
---
or maybe at minimum get runner up or something, that‚Äôd still be pretty cool.
---
UPVOTE THIS! What‚Äôs the point of being the star player of no rewards????
---
They didn‚Äôt change the background for the shop, characters, and social tabs to the new background. Is it meant to be like that or did they just forget?
---
Or you get star points based off total kills.
---
They are not lego... If they were lego every brawler Who steps on them must die
---
Wow, that‚Äôs a good idea for a new mortis‚Äôs SP:
---
‚ÄúBleeding‚Äù (since he is a vampire, every hit will cause a bleeding effect and enemy will get 100 damage 2 seconds or something like that)
---
Or maybe get runner up. Either way, participation is what counts.
---
scrappy on cocaine
---
Does it give crow aswell?
---
You're right.
---
It has happened to me several times
---
Indeed
---
Why the clickbait?
---
Where is the baby creature of the night
---
De Frank gone in the wrong neighborhood
---
Really? Huh
---
I saw so many of this, im gonna make youtube of this
---
Season rewards still exist, it's just that you have to have at least one brawler above 500 trophies to get them. They also give star points now not tokens.
---
Yes, she can charge up her super in 2-3 FULL SHOTS. She hardly ever gets full shots. The only way to charge her super is to slowly get medium range chips shots, which takes forever. Also, she IS only good in brawl ball. In gem grab there aren‚Äôt many tanks, so she‚Äôs useless, and she gets outclassed completely by spike and Carl who are just better mid ranged brawlers for gem grab right now. In heist, she‚Äôs Outclassed by Darryl and bull who can actually attack the save. Siege is all about controlling the map with long range brawlers and throwers, the types of brawlers she is bad against, bounty is all long ranged brawlers, and in showdown a lot of the maps are suited towards long ranged brawlers and throwers. However, there are a few maps she is good on. So, she‚Äôs only good in brawl ball and some showdown maps.
---
Token double and the tickets.
---
Damn you right
---
"Defend againts level 42 Siege Bot!"
---
It also makes you select the Brock skins you have more easily when Brock gets 420 skins.
---
How
---
At 5k
---
then she spins on you
---
Ur beta and don‚Äôt have all star power? You must not play much huh
---
I got 3280 with dynamike
---
or maybe at the beginning when all the brawlers are shown there could be this icon in the corner
---
Holy shit!!!
---
Still it's only 30 percent damage reduction.And Shelley still can kill him.
---
Crow remodel sounds kinda cool
---
Same sounds and same effects except not gold. Meh. It‚Äôs ok. I just want the skins. The colours don‚Äôt matter all that much. And knowing more star skins will appear next month.
---
It is not a man
---
I mean I got 5,100 SP from only one brawler (Darryl)
---
That potato mine thicc boi which I forgot the name of is Tiktok confirmed.
---
i get what you‚Äôre saying.
---
Well if Bulls and Shelly‚Äôs are in nearly every fucking map, I‚Äôm pretty sure he needs a buff
---
Good call
---
aaaaaand he doesnt get the joke
---
Crow already has two remodels in his skins. His Phoenix and Mecha skins are good enough.
---
Great job lmao
---
I want mecha Crow please!!
---
F for ghast
---
I hope supercell will accept fan ideas ü§ûüèª
---
This is amazing. Well timed with snk hype right now.

They‚Äôre actually referencing [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/c6f24g/im_starting_to_realize_how_ridiculous_saving_up/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app)  that talks about it and does an analysis on it.
---
I personally think people are missing the point that this update is new and should wait for future updates. Maybe SC will implement another mechanic that helps you win more SP
---
I think passage is garbage a lot of teamers
---
Ikr mortis is ass in this current meta
---
I will .... Some day... Until then, you can help me make it less cringy by telling me what do you see in the story that feels very cringy... Is it the poses, the story itself, or the dialogues? I will improve anything while I can
---
Where the fuck is Rico? No Jesse or Pam either. Horrible
---
Exactly
---
This is so cool
---
Tick super: dO yOu WAnt tO pLay wiTh mE.
---
It's not teaming, I just happening to spin in a circle a few times and they just leave me alone. I just like to spin I swear

Who else thinks that it's the best season yet?

Well at least u saw leon in the video

Don't worry m8 they can still get balanced

All your comments on this community are about hate. Go do something else with your time, your input is not needed here.
---
It's strategy game so no you have to play with caution
---
I can't believe for the sniper character they made it a 1800s girl in a dress.  At the very least she could hold her umbrella like a gun.
---
Eventhough getting to 500 trophies is easier , the seasonal rewards (star tokens) contribute nothing to general brawler progression , cause currently the only thing you can buy are skins. Compared to the old system , earning new brawlers, coins, gems, power points has gotten a whole lot harder
---
Would love to see the option of buying star powers or chest though, an option to convert star tokens to keys would be convenient too.
---
we need the rlly peaceful outro
---
I think it‚Äôs fine. It showcases what the update includes to any casual player who doesn‚Äôt watch YT or follow this subreddit. 
---
Casual players would have no idea what the new skins look like unless they see it in game.
---
L
---
I just put all my other guys on hold for the day and used Shelly. Got 90 trophies just by spamming her super. Sure, the map is stupid, but if you go along with it you can gain trophies.
---
I was abot to comment that
---
atleast its better than eye of the storm.
---
Actually, in kill feed it shows as black
---
What?
---
I hope not
---
Idk, I guess we memed the ‚Äúuno is my game‚Äù thing too hard
---
uhh dark grey?
---
Just what I want to see in the game. Hope this gets recognized.

---
I think OP is trying to say that they got matched with some so low in total trophies when theirs is at 6k. But The brawler trophies are similar and as far as I know doesn‚Äôt the match making depend on brawler trophy and not total ?

I got 1.5 for free wit no brawlers over 500. I am soo confused.

---
I must disagree. For one, she can‚Äôt break walls, a key part of brawl ball. Her attacks also deal low damage to the usually tanks brawlers found in brawl ball. She also doesn‚Äôt have as much health as a tank, so she isn‚Äôt very good at carrying the ball. Overall, she isn‚Äôt the worst at brawl ball, but she certainly isn‚Äôt a top tier pick.
---
Maybe it's "brawl stars".
---
TICK : I fear no man
---
TICK : But that thing
---
MORTIS
---
TICK: its scares me
---
In practice mode, switch to brawler A (desired star power), then quickly switch to brawler B (desired brawler), then you can have brawler B using brawler A's star power.
---
i mean it was pretty predictable probably everyone knew it was coming. it‚Äôs really nothing to be excited about :/
---
Hey! OP is a grown adult who doesn‚Äôt need you to tell them simple stuff like this /s
---
I appreciate your enthusiasm for sarcasm, but indicating it defeats its purpose.
---
You really are the worst bot.
---
As user CarrieMH687 once said:
---
&gt; Why do you waste your time doing this
---
*I'm a human being too, And this action was performed manually. /s*
---
I consistently own Mortis with dynamike,  ofc I'm at power  10, and constantly utilize his star power. 
---
 I don't understand how people can't kill him unless you literally walk into a Bush he's in unprepared.
---
Ah right it's a map. I dont usually look at map names I just jump in!
---
Too op, they should lower the amount of hp she gets from the starpower
---
Anyone who ever loved you was wrong.
---
*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. If you're human and reading this, you can help by reporting or banning u/The-Worst-Bot. I will be turned off when this stupidity ends, thank you for your patience in dealing with this spam.*
---
*PS: Have a good quip or quote you want repeatedly hurled at this dumb robot? PM it to me and it might get added!*
---
This "gem" is extremely basic in format and has already been done before. The only comedic value of this post is the original picture.
---
Number 15
---
You don't even need 3 direct shots with dynamike to take out mortis,  people just need to practice more with dynamike ssns have more situational awareness.
---
He's Says "Brawl Stars" In the music

I wish I could say "Welcome to this sub" but the past few years it's more like "Welcome to Reddit" whenever opinions or even fucking QUESTIONS are downvoted

Tick is wortless.  By far the worst brawler in the game.

IT'S NO USE

Silver in Brawl Stars confirmed
---
I think it should be like that until the Star Power pops off mid match, like when Shelly has Band Aid once it is used for the first time the icon is shown underneath her so the surprise is still there
---
Yeag!
---
NANI!
---
I‚Äôm glad you do!

It's not that hard to get a star power it's like 2-3 weeks of grinding I'm almost about to get two more
---
This is incredible
---
Oh wait sirry, we spawns a wall, which looks like this I assume?
---
....

---
I'm doing this for crow. Link please.
---
It is not that it looks bad, the old models were made with a less efficient system (harder to make skins with) that has since been replaced and he will likely need to be modeled in the new system at some point.
---
Yeah sure
---
I wish I could do this with other people
---
**The PP**
---
Cuz u played friendly and used a glitch which makes star powers compatible with any other brawler. Please try colt with the brock one, it's absolutely insane
---
No, it looks like this:    .....

At rank 10, u get 100. At rank 15, u get 200. At rank 20, u get 300.

Creator codes are already implemented in the game

Never, i want that robo mike

Learn to use him
---
New PornHub seems pretty good
---
oh. It said I got star points for ranking up. That‚Äôs confusing. Seems like it could‚Äôve been a little mor informative
---
Because u are at very low level and people don't understand this
---
This needs to be implemented. I made a similar post not realising something similar was posted.
---
What kind of humour is this

I'm always stuck at 99 too, I don't know how the f* it's possible

Tick just ran up to Penny‚Äôs (Pennies?) cannon and yeeted it onto his arm(s).
---
Yes but its your friend's fault
---
For me i just play with 300 trophies players who are bad and that make me upset
---
Thank you. Goodnight as well.
---
Another Tick cuz everyone is Tick
---
I wouldn't really call 14 trophies a tilt
---
I think pam and piper need a remodel, but crow and primo.......nah bro
---
(Just my opinion of course)

It is. A 300 trophies brawler is not better than a 380 trophies player.
---
The proof was in this game he was so bad and make me lose and its not normal
---
And I prefer that !
---
Hopefully. Chandler really needs to step it up a notch. He always makes it to be 3rd / 2nd but then drops out. It still must be fun to participate though, he seems pretty happy. I can‚Äôt imagine how much his family makes fun of him for losing all those challenged though.

Ur a genius with hiding behind the walls. Pretty smart!

World record? The Best i`ve seen is 3 brawlers
---
ABSOLUTE HELL
---
‚Äúyou only had him on 40 trophies‚Äù
---
Did you think for at least a second that he just got Ricochet and this is a very old screenshot?
---
Just a little
---
Can I have that format pls. Send a link and I will be happy!
---
Good job on getting Bo. Quite the achievement, if I do say so myself.
---
5.4k and no gene
---
Fair enough. I went from 387 to 270 with him a little while ago. Still haven't fully recovered yet
---
I think a little bit more than 4 hours
---
Can u do this for my voice lines ?
---
No its Jeff
---
I don't remember who I was playing as but I was playing with my friend who just uses Primo and Frank and he decided to switch it up and use Colt
---
Wow, well the work really paid off. I want to draw like this eventually. Have a fantastic rest of your day, Nekane_owo.
---
He has high damage
---
It‚Äôs really heartwarming when even if you lose a match they want to continue playing as a team
---
Wow
---
Bulgaria
---
Bull, Rosa, Shelly, Bibi, and primo run the roost. Just spam autoaim in the grass
---
Did he buy all the legendaries lol seems too good to be true
---
These two are way better.
---
Darryl has the highest damage in the game and is beefy.
---
I liked the Old Old model and i still approve of the new old model. Its what we have, and need to appreciate
---
bruh

Thanks a lot. I am a f2p player and I have been playing since May with this account. I actually had many accounts that got lost because of lots of reasons and I am really happy that I am finally at 3k.
---
That‚Äôs panther from persona 5 lol
---
Looks really nice btw
---
What do you guys think?
---
I also see it as being a good player, losing a match doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean your team played bad, maybe the other one did better and that‚Äôs all. Spotting good teammates even if you lose is a good quality.
---
It‚Äôs similar to the stuff on r/okbuddyretard
---
Perhaps
---
Ok, let's f*ck supercell and his update.
---
All is going well but this f*cking matchmaking makes me lose trophies and play with 0 trophies tick
---
Rico is great. I feel like people usually underestimate him, when you can use other brawlers like Rosa or Crow, etc. If you play to his strengths, like you said, he will deal out massive damage. I hope his second star power is good, because usually when you‚Äôre attacking someone with Rico funny enough, I have found in most cases you‚Äôre just trying to shoot directly at them rather then walk shot.
---
I'm jealous of the Leon that always gets but in the match and gets 1st.
---
It's more like "Welcome to Internet"
---
What!!!!
---
Yeah that glitch is very fun, have you tried colt or primo with Brock‚Äôs star power? It is cool
---
Have you seen his arms and hands ?
---
Guess who dont have penny, myTHICCS and legendaries at 4k? And guess who have all brawlers at 3k? MY FRIENDS

Check ur battle log and see if u got an all Tick game with the same trophies as those ticks

Ya good luck getting that skin. There should be over 40k comments by now

When you get all the gems and pull them back into your spawn it gets horrifying. You can‚Äôt run back away from the mines so it‚Äôs really easy to kill you when 9 mines are being tossed at you at once. I recorded a video of a game just so I could savor the pure idiocy that was going on.

In his scarf he has a symbol that looks like a pirate, and it looks like he had stick legs, like a pirate, but it's just my opinion.

Now there are new shop design

Blatant repost with almost the exact sam entitle as the original.

Oh Sorry I For Real Didn‚Äôt Have My Glasses On ! üòÇ
---
And how many trophies have you got?:D
---
Prepare for trouble
---
Oh boy this hit me right in the feels, I remember playing this game a lot when I was younger on my dad‚Äôs phone until he one day accidentally deleted the app by accident since he didn‚Äôt know what he was doing ;(
---
For people who don't care about the looks or anything, here's are shortened version of his stats
---
  
---
1 ammo
---
First brawler hit is pushed back 2 tiles and will be drained of 2 of their ammo slots.  
---
Successful hits will come back to Lewe and give him 3 ammo slots of the person he hit.  
---
(ex. if he hit Gene he will be able to attack with Gene's normal attack 3 times)
---
After using all three attacks he will have a cooldown before he can copy someone's attack again.
---
Spawnables, power cube boxes, and 3v3 objectives (like the safe or the IKE) will take damage every 0.5 seconds until he uses his attack again.
---
Super: Throw a hat on the ground. Pressing the super again makes Lewe teleport to the hat and deal damage in a 4x4 tile radius.  
---
The hat is temporary and can be seen by everyone.
---
Will be hidden if put in a bush.
---
Star power #1:
---
Increases the damage range of Lewe's super when he teleports. Also shoots confetti which can pierce through walls
---
Star power #2:
---
If Lewe goes under 50% of his health the brawler who last damaged him will get damaged 20% of their current health and their attack reload speed gets slowed down by 15%
---
FEEDBACK: I think its a really cool brawler to play. However, the cooldown after his three shots is sort of weak due to the fact that some brawler attacks are close range and he is very vulnerable during that time His health I assume is sort of on the lower end of brawlers around 3500 so I think his super wont help too much because he is mostly attacking from far away (since he can't shoot after his three attacks for a certain amount of time) His super should knock people back and stun for a short amount of time (like shelly's super.) (confetti would not stun)
---

Learn how to play the game, it shouldn‚Äôt tell you what everyone has that ruins the whole element of it.

Lol happens all the time when I spectate, really is disappointing but nothing you can do about it
