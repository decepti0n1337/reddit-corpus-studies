Sorry for my language but Lemme just say for the last time, u/donghoonisbad isn't me

---
---
So is Fortnite :O
---
Now he has more power.
---
Dude, honestly: Can't wait for you to master 3d design. You ROCK! I really hope that your effort will be payed back by being hired at Supercell. You totally deserve it. Keep it up!
---
I thought it hit the walls😂
---
I was honestly surprised when I scored😂
---
What are the 7 skins? I can think of the beach, boombox, and Chinese new year one. What are the other 4?
---
Tickets if you have the balls
---
Lol
---
LMFAOOO
---
Not everything revolves around reddit bruh, the original was posted on facebook.
---
Too bad its stolen
---
I like the snake movement part but besides that I don't like it
---
Nahh... just.. kill her
---
Yeah shame. Stunning work by the actual artist though
---
Nwm may be ugly but his/her animations are arguably the best, her super patterns looks so cool
---
Yeah I can't see one of them.

Poco is actually a strong brawler. People just think his job is to heal.

Reddit whats up with this

This subreddit is ruthless
---
No1 gonna mention FreeGP's Beard pictures that was in kairos video

u/FreeFGP posted about it too
---
u/DonghoonisBad is a bad imposter of me who stoke gedi kors tiger nita skin
---
Screw Fortnite. Let’s make Brawl Stars number 1
---

---
Report these 2 to the moderators of this subreddit to get them banned for pretending to be you and for trying to get a bad name at you. Im doing it right now and you should too
---
Yeah wtf
---
He deleted the entire account like a lil bitch
---
Don't forget the candy in his pocket!
---
I was gonna say why did u put piper in there and then I realized anything can happen when u play with randoms
---
*And I still won’t get a legendary*
---
u/zigzarlu u/pussgurka u/trikshot360 (sorry mods for pinging u guys again)
---
Ban u/donghoonisbad? He stole GEDI-KORS skin which is already against subreddit rule but his name is offensive to me. He is pretending to be me
---
Nice
---
Anyone else here OJ saying POSITIVE ELIXIR TRADE
---
Send them picture proof if you need it
---
Wanna test that theory
---
Siege be like
---
Supercell has no brain... You should expect this when they released Rosa
---
u/Mr_J-
---
If only that happened in game lol
---
oh god its like u/dariusbrawlstars all over again
---
ik but they actually make comics and some random guy comes over and like imma take this without your permission bye bye, like disney is too big to care at this point but they spent several hundred hours a month making these for people
---
This needs to happen
---
Only if the old models were way to diferents, because a lot of people miss them, you know? It's only a idea
---
Hey not cool man
---
Epic gamer moment
---
in HK,u mean Hong Kong?
---
Leon gets no love and it’s honestly so sad, I hope he gets a little buff in the next update due to Rosa

Rosa's super is as easy to cycle as shelly's, that's what I find to be the problem. Her range is quite large and wide, at least with primo you sometimes have a second chance if you get in range.
---
It’s more so a cliche for low quality and money hungry content creators. Basically stretching it out sometimes twice as long as it needs to be. It’s ok if it’s done, but your going to get hate if you do it for every video.
---
Peuw u/BSModsarehos don't believe me

Translate: BLET is not a dirty word and if you watched the video IceArrow, then you saw that he didn’t use foul language and what would put it would say BLET. But this word is not a dirty word !!!
---
When i want to save boxes i just end up opening like 10 cuz i ,,Could find something"
---
Love the idea but that will just make him uglier
---
I think that she needs more hits to charge up her super. Only 3 hits and boom. Then she can chain her super very easily. Especially in Big Game, when she is the Big brawler, she can chain her super way too easily.
---
Yet the Rosa's i got on my team dont count considering they were level 1 with less than 100 trophies
---
BUFF LEON
---
Anyone got a link for the lazy?
---
Jessie is the enemy of the people. Play Shelly in big game
---
Lol I don’t think its stolen. Look at this guy’s profile, he’s a great artist
---
ACK THIS IS SO CUTE MY HEART
---
How would Rosa on your team counter piper?
---
Bro that Shelly, she could've just ended it, right there
---
What’s with the speech bubbles
---
[deleted]

Jessie is op af in big game
---
I had a 34-0 shutout in bounty. We didn’t even let em have center star.
---
What the hell have you brought upon this cursed land?
---
*jumps in glee*
---
This is better than mine!
---
Yea but she isn’t good against the big brawler. You are way more likely to be not big brawler, and Shelly is super good at that. I play Shelly, and if ik big brawler then I get killed as fast as possible because it benefits 5 other people
---
Omg muy heart
---
The art piece on which I worked very hard.
---
Thanks for supporting me bro!
---
Also funny moments channel gain more views and subs than thosee who work hard on their content . Like Kairos puts a ton of work into his videos and Editing. Granted he has a big community but not a lot of views. Same for Rey Cory Ben and others. People go for funny moments
---
Brock don’t stop
---
Yeah but make it wider so it’s easier to see
---
Omg this is very underrated take my upvotes
---
That's all because of your support... Thanks to the makers and to the reviewers... I am so happy now

Change name to the new brawler than you dont have

Ok!
---
Yea. I'm pretty sure it took you hours to steal that skin. I bet you couldn't decide which skin to steal so you stole GEDI-KOR'S VERY FIRST SKIN.
---
Everyone should do this... To spread love and peace
---
Leon is basically free trophies... If you dont meet any teamers
---
Sin #10: The piper is now in the franks range, and he has 36 power cubes, so why isn't she dead yet?
---
Oh I get it. They're different.
---
Gedikor's post is original.
---
Your post is a dumb piece of trash.
---
She kicked the ball into your own goal right?
---
Remove it from the game
---
Crow is also underrated

Why was this comment downvoted? The /s stands for sarcasm.

Put Crow into the underrated slot

If you play with 1 token and get big brawler, always do what this Frank did

I am that guy 😜

Poor Frank

Cool idea something like minecarts madness i suppose
---
Big *OOF*
---
Time to get that loot

Done

I love it!

Beautiful, great job

Actually you should credit the original one AKA me since the other is literally just painting in white all text

😂😂👌👌💢💢🍆🍆😂😂👌die

You have not been playing for nearly as long as the top players and that’s ok, just keep on pushing and trying and you’ll catch up eventually

Would go on r/comedycentury IMO but it’s your first meme so you get a pass

You had to put the face of "The Rock"

Cause he is Bull! He can do whatever he wants!
---
I wonder if you are still saying that after he throws you a cactus grenade
---
Eye of the storm for example
---
Oh my Lord... This would be a tough fight.
---
It's because of the region you live in. Supercell even mage a chart, where should the game lag. Supercell announced, that they are working on this really hard, but I don't know how true is that
---
You are now can join mortis gang as good player
---
gonna crosspost this to r/BrawlStarsClips
---
Plz make more of these
---
Nice work mate!
---
Also gonna mention that my tag in Brawl Stars is #LROULGJC.
---
Nah im good
---
^^
---
I like how even spectator wants to team
---
Wait how to hide commect because i think i get it.
---
They are removing after 20 secs i think
---
Skinny Pam lol
---
They need more exbeeriance
---
hehe, great template btw
---
why thank you :D
---
Retried again. Two crows and me in between and A leon chasing me. You guessed it right -6.
---
I shout hooray everytime when crow or leon dies.
---
I want my mommy :(
---
Huh
---
ive only teamed once. it was at the end of the game where the only other person left was a mortis with one gem and i was bull with 14. i just waited to see how long the cloud would come in. i then killed him in a single shot.
---
Poco isn’t meant to be used in solo showdown. He’s a support brawler. He doesn’t need a buff at all. He’s well balanced and auto aimer’s wet dream.
---
Wow, such truths
---
Is she single?
---
and an invisible leon snatches them all
---
Weird flex but OK.
---
That’s why it’s illegal, cuz he’s not supposed to be used in showdown bruv
---
How can you guys get this images after the name,  like, you are the mortis, how can i get the crow?
---
Also, I forgot to say that Shelly in the videos/ title screen has an earring and Jessie in her icon has black eyebrows
---
In which mode did u push him?
---
Any tips pls?
---
I struggle with mortis 😭
---
you meant the executioner
---
Right. I get that. But if you were serious about the buff. I dunno man. I’ve been awake for 34 straight hours. I’m not sure what’s real. Double whoosh everywhere.
---
Thank you all guys.
---
Thanks!
---
 Buff Tara
---
Hope you don’t mind me asking... what does he throw?

Computer editing ;)
---
Naw I think it’s worth it
---
I hit 10.7k today!
---
jessie's too
---
Which kind of map is best for mortis??
---
Its not going to be 100% accurate
---
Even with that in mind, your post is absolutely unfunny.

Oof thanks for telling me the source

Nooo no no no we are NOT doing another snake prairie!

---
that one in the middle tho
---
What would it shoot
---
I don’t have a good history with these types of maps. They left a bad taste in my mouth. No offense, but these types of maps are where randoms shine in stupidity
---
Lol. I changed it now.
---
He said that he did it without teaming smh
---
Well no but learn how to freaking play the game if you know how to play you already should know frank can be countered so learn how to play brawl  ball and if you were in frwaking rank 14 why do you play seoge it it is just tilting your trophies end of arguement i am turning of notifications
---
I think that you don't know how to spell throwers I think you wrote maze
---
Tbh when it comes to randoms you're right cuz they probably will only focus on the middle and thats it
---
Thanks Sherlock
---
haha
---
oh yeah thanks to u/cosmiccrocodile for the idea
---
Why are there springs right into the enemy base? If the robot used it, it would give a huge advantage.
---
That might be true. It is important to note that I’m not saying Leon is op. Excluding game modes like brawl ball Rosa isn’t that good.
---
Because bulls

Hello! I'd like to ask you if I could use your clip as a part of my compilation of Brawl Stars Highlights. I'm an editor for the Gaming Curios network. You would be credited with your name on the screen along with a link to this post. Let me know, thank you! :)
---
Wait, that's illegal.
---
Uuurgh its not repost its crosspost
---
My point being if you need a gate to stop you from dropping than your skill level is not above 500. Also i’ve been playing since day one beta as well and if you have two maxed accounts you’ve got to be p2w my friend, there’s just no way. If you’re over 500 it should be harder to push, not easier, it should take more skill to go from 500 to 600 than it did to go from 400 to 500. What you are suggesting is merely a hand holding device for higher players, which is not what they need. Get good enough that you are consistent above 500, or drop below and than keep playing and get them back up.
---
Fun fact: she used to be _seriously_ OP upon release. (Just like Rosa &amp; Leon) And then the nerf came...

Why are not there missiles, energy drink or mushrooms?

 In a fight, collecting jewels, burglary, prize, or siege

 Because these are very beautiful in them

 Please return this stuff

High level with low trophies  show tht u lose a lot of games... y post? Lol
---
I think Rosa / Darry would still win in a 1vs1 fight. Mortis super damage value is not high. Right now, he doesn’t stand a chance at all.
---
Shrub Zone
---
Jokes old
---
You can win as soon as crow gets the second super. Just jump right onto the safe and hit one basic attack.
---
Holy shit its exactly the same
---
this is what you are missing when you dont browse by new

Can you give credit to the person who first gave the idea

Imagine having to rely on close ranged combat as a sharpshooter

She’s still OP, I think she should get a speed nerf. Or decrease in range

Why not, I miss lifeleech too 🤕

This comment was made by r/taragang

yeah that's the most annoying brawler in the game
---
i'd sign it

Dude, seriously? Did you really need to do that? I quit the game for reasons I may make a post about, but you don’t need to make a no-effort post about it

Spike has nipples apperently

Other than that you shoukd make more.
---
I suppose you are complaining about that Piper ?
---
Agreed, he needs a remodel of the remodel
---
Bull can still use to to escape, just don’t hit it in the middle
---
Even if they do drag along with bull, it’d be good for him because it’s a free kill basically
---
I like it. There’s just a. Lot of dead space you should fill in with water or Cactiw
---
Is there something for free?
---
that’s a better title
---
well, that's given, but darryl is ok without his star power
---
Apparently he’s a new player ... (only 12 brawlers ) why so mean lol u r noob too when u jz started playing (also 400 trophies lvl 3 Mortis is nth to brag abt lol)
---
What?
---
Habehabaaaa!
---
I dont team to win, i just lost 70 trophies due to teamers. If you cant beat them join them. You are not the one to tell me whether im bad or not.
---
Someone stole this already smh

Nobody:

so cool

Just normal showdown match on low trophies

Wait nevermind they deleted it lol

She is OP no doubt about that

Mother Jessie
---
I refuse to believe that

dont do this shelly theres so much ways to do it differently

They're hilarious IMO

Deadly weapons like a guitar, umbrella, fists, plants, shovels

This one made me really laugh
---
Colt turned into a goat due to being high on weed.
---

Then nerf her. You can't remove her
---
first of all, if you will block people beacuse you start losing an argument then go back to facebook,where no one can tell you how stupid you are possibly hurt your ego. aight? second: ,,you are party'' hmm..... i want to have fun like that too! ,,you case'' ,,should just'' ,,you please'' third of all, using emojis in 2019
---
It’s actually “play guitar.”
---
Btw are from greece? Im askin bc of ur name
---
I mean I was there and she wasn’t the most op like Rosa and Leon, she was just really good
---
Its a mix of taiwanese?(traditional chinese) chinese korean and japanese.Its not important but i just wanna point it out for fun  :p
---
It’s actually “Lead Guitar.”
---
It has not been 100% shown. Öeon is a kid in the modern age probably in a city according to his style and clothes. Nita comes from a tribe as Nita means bear in choktaw tribe or idk. Nita is obviously not from a city, more like from a tribe or group in the forest.
---
Someone playing piper on brawl ball is my fault right
---
1. Read the fucking subreddit
---
2. Wtf does that even mean.
---
I think he needs a faster attack speed

That could definitely work out too, he would be so much better if he was either quicker with his attack or did more damage!

A Colt can't take out a Piper and a Tara but a Poco can, seems legit. (I just recently did that in duo showdown. But nice art 😆

YOU ARE NOW SENTENCED TO DEATH VIA HANGING. BEFORE THIS, YOU MAY PLEAD MERCY, BUT BE WARNED, YOU MUST HAVE A GOOD REASON; AS HERESY SUCH AS YOURS IS AN UNTHINKABLE CRIME.

Teaming is probably the worst thing in game, it takes away all the strategy in sd, I myself ONLY push on sd (never team) and I am trying to reach 13k this season, but its really hard, cause I not only lose more compared to winning (proportionally), but I have to be careful with a bunch of brawlers that will just target the outsider, that cant do much other than run

Nice job
