Yeah. Skins don't have value

Wow, can I use it on my upcoming artwork?

Why does spike Look like a pickle?
---
I know there are people saying that brawlers like piper can grab all 10 gems gems and jump in the corners and they want me to fix this, but I honestly think that is annoying to keep uploading the same post multiple times. I hope you guys understand it :)

So you're saying there's a chance?

I don't recall Tik being able to stop time when he dies
---
FUUUUCK no. This would be overly toxic, highly unnecessary, and retarded like you.
---
No, horrible idea. 
---
Kids will make horrible decisions and people that were on the losing team will complain non stop about how they weren't given a chance to be on which team they want to be on or given a chance to make the choice to form a team that they like and so on and so forth. This will end up being no better than random mm.
---
Attention to all: this is not his art. Downvote and report.

Remove the 1 tile gaps

oh my goodness that's actually a little hilarious
---
Ah, thanks good to know that now I forgot lol
---
centre spawn plez
---
I think it adds randomization to the type of goals you get and makes the game more fun.
---
Well, we wouldn't be having this discussion if we can just ban the toxic players like csgo.
---
Bush maps yes but in close range with super she dominates in a bush map when she doesnt have super and is far away and mid rang that she can shoot she not that good
---
Because they‚Äôre ded
---
Woosj
---
You aren‚Äôt getting it. If you‚Äôre trash, your teammates will self score your own goal.
---
I just want to donate thropies with random why?
---
There should be a robber in ‚Äúrandoms in lone star‚Äù
---
There is no report staff in this idea. It's automatic.
---
I really like the color you chose, nice work!
---
Tick has never seen such BullTick before (with the images of bull and tick there)
---
I want to unsee this
---
Gwaaaaah!!!  I'm so hype!!!
---
That's really bad but believe me, I've had even worse. I'm at 15k, and got matched with two randoms at 3.3k and 800, against a team of 17k, 15.6k and 8k. Super fun brawl ball game for sure, I was the only one alive in our team for the whole game and I still somehow managed to get a draw.
---
Hamburger
---
Sniped, LOL
---
Also mentioned in r/photoshopbattles
---
It's not funny
---
Maybe beacause i used the tools right. I have still mortis, bibi and rico to show
---
This map makes it so much easier with Leon to just walk into a bush and go invisible. Great map idea!
---
Sounds good but in reality it would be a flaw. Some group of people will find a way to block you for no reason. Then you got banned without doing anything.
---
Buy them and max her out
---
Same
---
Spike should be the only one without a voice, since he's a cactus and having a voice would ruin him.
---
*insert comment that appreciates the post while saying 'guys im shaking' in a subtle way*
---
Mortis and Poco makes this brawler. Also, it should be a mythic because Mythic is the only type of brawler that has 3 brawlers in its category. Other than that, great brawler idea!
---
Sadly i couldnt :(
---
Why the fuck does Bibi have giant badgondongahoos?
---
I see more of an isekai style
---
Thank you for that!
---
Nice Poco flex
---
Repost bro
---
Nope. Maybe the same idea
---
This will be cool
---
I think Mortis has a shovel reloading animation too!
---
You can see you made a screenshot
---
Teammate of courseüëå
---
It's called teaming against a massive threat,
---
Now I'm not spin to win but you were a massive threat so they teamed to eliminate you to get a better chance at getting 1st
---
XD
---
lmao it was a joke
---
This subreddit is only for brawl stars not for call of duty mobile

Seriously, replays like this makes me wanna have teamkill as an option

r/antishakers arriving soon. Quickly please
---
I agree
---
What do u mean deflect. Like is the damage negated or is it rebounded onto the inflictor. Nice concept though.
---
i feel like this will be in hot soon
---
It is no  a reason to finish the match , maybe I could win in the second round and we have extra time to untie but she or he doesn't want try to win.....
---
The thing is that he asked me for one of his videos and credited me, im sorry thid happend to you. :/
---
It has a low health with even higher dps than a Tara herself and it has an insane movement speed
---
If you say so then good for you m8
---
Sorry I mean negated. Up.
---
You know a game is meant to be played right?
---
perhaps give way to a straight path from spawn
---
Correction - Shield should be negating 50% Damage, not deflect
---
Great idea! Thanks
---
Also a Correction - Shield should be negating 50% Damage, not deflect
---
**Nice**
---
Nice
---
When u combine MORTIS n POCO . U'll get MUERTE. Well seems a bit overpowered but u know supercell
---
Smug
---
Maybe her umbrella coyld be a heart as well!
---
Have you considered the fact that you're trash
---
I love Piper she sound so sweet and she speaks western english so well I love her so much she sings and perform on stage so well. Is the massage stil there I want to know for sure.
---
Do you believe me now!
---
In my opinion I think Shelly is easy to kill but I gotta admit her super is a little bit too cheap.
---
ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I think Shield and Damage Boost are too OP... I would half both of them. With that change they'll be vauable, but not OP
---
Star shelly players are toxic
---
Omg, yes, exist a person that first time heard of the word. So what? Jesus you guys...
---
The question is the best way to ‚Äúupgrade‚Äù after a kill. Should it remove you from the map for a few seconds and re-spawn you like you died? This would give you a few seconds to choose which star-power you want on your next brawler, provided you have that star power on that brawler. Also, I propose that there is a set list of the brawlers in each map, that show up on the side of the screen that shows the order of upgrade. That way, you can tell who is closer to the end of the list, and who is behind.
---
Cool but not balanced it will be anoying like the juice is
---
Also maybe give time before the match to choose the star power. A big problem with this mode however would be teaming. They could easily farm kills off each other until nine, then the first person to get another kill wins.
---
Awesome
---
Because memes are üëåüëåüëå
---
This seems copied
---
Because memes are epic
---
That will make the game harder
---
How did you do that?
---
OH HAHAH THATS AMAZING
---
[Insert upvote here]
---
Bro same but I'm just glad I was on meme review
---
Well yes, but most of the time it is basically just an endless fight between the 2 players and then the boss is already dead by the time 2 players finally kill each other.
---
Also, what I see more commonly is that people chase you throughout the whole match and both of you can‚Äôt touch the bot
---
Totally awesome!
---
Rapid reload, snappy sniping.
---
How did you not get a bot?
---
What trophy range?
---
A girlfriend is super rare legendary
---

I honestly dont no üòÖ

You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in court.
---
I usually only play solo modes at 500-600 it is quite low but this is quite annoying
---
Solo modes are basically broken above 700 trophies for me
---
Wow cool
---
That's rlly good you should do red barley and blue barley
---
the only way you're getting sandy rn
---
Who do you typically use?
---
Hawt
---
When you realize piper in a bush
---
you cant just call someone that for a stupid reason
---
It seems to complicate the game a bit
---
Wow thats cool
---
Where do I get that sticker?
---
Oh no he stole the meme that takes 30 seconds to me and has a idea so original that i have seen it like 5 times on this sub. You people act like this is the Mona Lisa.
---
Imagine poco
---
Yeah, a report button for the Shelly
---
No offense but bad grammar...
---
I want to do that when I‚Äôm done bulls sometimes El primo kills me.
---
Don't make stuff more confusing man
---
not bad random. reason: it's either because they played for the first time or their sibling plays on their account.
---
not afk random. reason: might've not known when they aren't able to play a match.
---
not a random with a really bad brawler for the map. reason: they might've not had brawl stats for brawl stars. (it's an app who show's you which brawler is recommended for each map and more)
---
and not a random, whose game is lagging. reason: they might be pros but have the bad luck of having poor wifi.
---
Oh god, a lot of Spikes
---
Thank you!
---
Nobody would opt in. And the leaderboards would be stupid. Reset is designed to keep the ladders competitive.

Um.. wut

ITS NIGHT WITCH poco.....

isnt showdown luck based already, for the most part ? if you are unlucky you get cornered by 3 or 4 teamers

Its kinda creepy

I wasn't sure if it submitted
---
I had no idea what I did. I just aimed and in it went. ;)
---
Please dont implement this. The power ups on the Maps where they exist are already overpowered and totally rng. 
---
This would only make the game more luck based
---
yeah i commented the text in the comments if you can‚Äôt read it
---
It's a very good idea but the showdown won't be the same :/
---
It works on some maps like feast or famine
---
Wow, these ideas are actually really good, and they are not op. Really good in my opinion!
---
There are people with way less brawlers at way higher trophies than you, Just dont complain, you Will get One before or after
---
8-bit with a speed boost boost is still slow
---
im surprised that its not a rick roll

I would disagree.

Uh IÔ∏è want detector , imagine all the bull IÔ∏è would see

this happened to me I made a post a while ago and it got like 1.k upvotes. my best one. This guy who‚Äôs not english gets my post and does the same shit. he gave no credit. I then do the same thing you said. and I got shited on
---
Yeah but kinda time consuming still great loved it as overtime happens very rare or we can instead remove over time and directly hop in penalties üëç
---
Typical primo defending a piper
---
Aaaah, you always have such a cool render!
---
‚ÄúI‚Äôm unfunny‚Äù what do u mean ?? Can u explain it to us
---
Crow with the speed boost.
---
Why though
---
Yessssxxyic. H

Why??? This is a wall to give opinions , all we are free to speak loosely , but is true that sometimes we can misunderstand. It's depends each person.

Cute, want this skin in game :O
---
Milkshake gives a 300% boost
---
should i ask him?
---
Imagine Sans finding this guy.
---
No bug here, you kicked the ball too soon, so it clipped the edge of the box
---
Even if they didn't score the ball, most of the time poco is star player possibly because of his healing, not every poco player is the same y'know.

Piper the sniper
---
I don‚Äôt think supercell will make a mode where the brawlers are random. Personally I don‚Äôt like it as well it would be very awkward for pushing a brawler or playing a brawler. I enjoy the freedom of playing whoever I want
---
No crediting. Really? Dont you get it?
---
I think it should be its raven in Turkish and test that I tried other appropriate names and that also didn't work and apparently supercell doesn't care when contact them about this
---
Well this is nice my most upvoted post is me doing nothing

I got sandy the other day from a megabox (season reset). LOL

Last brawler i got was 8-bit and i‚Äôm missing all the legendaries, tara and gene, last non trophy road brawler was bibi so uhmm

Honestly though, i whould play barley because the 2 thic walls

Go away. Shoo

I know but I am just saying that I could be a skin but it needs some changes.

Opened a brawl box (100 tokens) at school and got Leon. I have not gotten any epic or mythic brawler before.

On the green clouds above the showdown I say storm and what else to call it and im not NOOOB

r/russian
---
LOL, there's a problem with the Russian servers. Even if you have a good WIFI, your game will lag. In YouTube there's so many videos about connecting issues. I don't think 100 Mbits is bad. It's like 10 megabytes in one second. So, it's supercell's fault. BTW, sorry for my English. If I had a shitty WIFI, I couldn't upload this video...
---
If you want this in the game then it definetely needs improvements. Otherwise it looks okay.

Leon is actually really good, but you just need to know how to play him.  If you don't know how to play him, you'll suck at him.  Leon is a very high skill brawler.  A lot of people argue that he's medium or low skill, but he's definitely high skill.  A lot of people play him like a medium or low skill brawler, and that's why people think he's bad.
---
Because you're wrong.
---
Crow, Crow, Crow, then Crow.

Cool but not the best
---
Isn't it barley?

Pretty sure it's the same sound when you get a rare brawler.

I'm just imaging tara using her black hole open up a space for a dynajump dynamike at the end of a duo showdown game.

Yes it's probably true. Same here, Takedown and Lone Star, especially Takedown, are getting very frustrating.

Dude, your ideas are so good, i litterally loved every of your posts since i joined reddit, thank you for making my days every time you post!

One guy once posted a mod idea here for Showdown that would make that If somebody destroy box or kill a brawler it's Power Cubes will be automatically added to him and won't drop on the ground
---
The Brawler who's in the middle always get bullied by the other two

Wow üòã

Ok, I like the speed up ideas, but yeah, also it‚Äôs so easy now to get a brawler to at least 400 so you might aswell just start pushing

He looks so cool and funny you shuld pair him up with poco spike and jessie plushes if you have them

This will honestly make the game so much funner tbh

Poco be like: "well that sucks!"

Jessie be like: if i don't move maybe these weirdos will go away

Not needed but would be a nice addition

it looks like bs hell and bull heaven

Looks like poco cool

I think that it would be great becasue clash royale has it and so does clash of clans so why not brawl stars?

Matchmaking is based on the highest brawler on a team, otherwise pros can have someone else make a mini and push with thier, say 1100 carl

Im very sorry for that. I just wanted to be more creative with designs instead of just "the reaper". Im very sorry if this reminded you of someone that died.

They actually team on you because they are upset you closed Darryl, they hate the way people is just flat and choose the easier brawler that is always a tank.
