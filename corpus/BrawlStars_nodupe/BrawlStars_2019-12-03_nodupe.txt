Thanks! I submitted 3 clips! I didn‚Äôt realize on the first 2 that I was supposed to check both boxes on the last question... sorry but you do have permission to put the clips in any of your videos! Thanks again!
---
Everyone an art connoisseur, just appreciate what the guy made holy shit
---
Tracing is tracing...The pictures overlap. It‚Äôs a good art-edit and people like it, myself included.
---
Emz needs one
---
Your rite

I LOVE how you researched this idea very throughly before fully executing it! Lots of effort, I can see

Bro, this is literally right below the original "art" post on my feed. XD

*Slowly takes back upvote from other post*
---
You‚Äôre a fraud for karma. Shame.
---
No, of course not. Yet this isn't a case of someone trying to "draw realistically from the model." They traced a photoshop composite of the goggles and face, then added their own hair and body.
---
Who is the person in the photo?
---
You can‚Äôt fool the internet mate.
---
Follow u/BrawlStarsDatamines, he post all the leaked things of brawl strs and this fool just stole this.
---
He/she probably used them as an outline...
---
In Royale they didn't actually mute. You would still see that exclamation mark icon or whatever. You also had to turn it off every time you started the game. If he had something in the settings where I can make it completely go away I would have done it and still be playing today
---
He stealed that image from BrawlStarsDatamines (is a user of reddit, i dont want to mention him more)
---
I didn‚Äôt use photoshop, i used apple pancil and procreate app and the image is a reference. It took me one whole day to do this. If i used photoshop it‚Äôs easier, probably need a few mins only to add paint effect.
---
It should shoot candy cane patern

Everyone makes Jessie older than she is.

I can feel you.

No, it's not, legys should never be a reward in trophie road

I like your idea but I feel like the price is a bit to high considering that you can buy token doublers and tickets cheaper and buy a starpower. But this is just and idea so im not trying to be mean :)

---
No it‚Äôs not terrible. A few small edits should do the trick. You can remove some of the boxes and that could be where the power cubes spawn.
---
I can‚Äôt show what it would look because I‚Äôm a iOS user and the brawl map creator isn‚Äôt there.
---
His effectiveness depends a lot on what the other team is using because he gets easily countered by a lot of brawlers. Close range like bull, Darryl and Shelly destroy him, and long range like spike, Brock, Piper and Colt can hit Frank outside of his effective range. 
---
Also doesn‚Äôt help that a lot of the recent brawlers also counter Frank (Bibi, Tick, Emz and 8-bit)
---
I agree that Frank works best in lower trophies, I had BB matches where I dominated as Frank but that doesn‚Äôt happen that often.
---
Wow, it actually worked, thanks üëç

What

I think they just took it down
---
I mean the animation already looks dirty...
---
Theres a jessie art in the brawl stars subreddit and some people are dissing it because the artist used a face as a reference even though he drew most of it by himself.
---
She traced. This post just highlights why the artwork looked off in that sense and the source picture that was used.
---

The people I'm arguing against are those discrediting the artwork. Especially that one person who just spammed links on that artwork and discrediting it. That just ticked me off because he spent so much time to diss the artwork and spread hate revolving around it.
---
yeah this looks familiar
---

You only saw the top comments, many people were convinced that they is effort. If there is effort, its NOT a repost.

Good bot
---
Idea*
---
Didn‚Äôt know Jesse was Asian. Thought she was hillbilly
---
The bee sniper is just a concept name but I like this concept
---
Dont forgot 1 ticket
---
Her projectiles are so slow and has very poor damage.
---
She is only remotely usable with her super. And her super charging takes forever
---
Even if you get her super. Scrappy dies always misses and dies instantly even with energize and proper placement. 
---
She is non existent in the competitive meta and is the most difficult brawler to push in higher trophies.
---
There were a few people doing that, i didnt see anyone who was discrediting it tho, what was he called i can report him
---
Thank you :) noted. Will do in the future.
---
Others disagree. Most people are saying, oh yeah he did steal that part. Automatic downvote, after this guy spammed a link to a post where it dissed the artwork.
---
Yea it's pretty obvious that she traced. Though, that doesn't at all take away from her skill if that's what you're implying. She still had to have the skill required to recreate and draw the image in her own style. You try tracing this and see what your end result it. Probably a pile of dog shit.
---
el erimo
---
I actually made some modded clips for the guy in the bottom left. He paid me $20, which was great for me because I would have happily made them for free. He put a few videos up, which got lots of attention. Then supercell took them down. After that, he just stopped uploading.

Thank you. ^  v ^
---
Thank you so much!!
---
ƒ∞f you hate randoms,why dont you play with your friends ? ƒ∞f you dont have friends play solo
---
That sucks, no one needs to know how the sausage gets made. Its still great art
---
Sorry I dont know how to link a comment
---
Yes. Many professional artists trace. Even Renaissance artists traced back then.
---
That's ok, I'll look for it
---
If you want it on top play review go to r/brawlstarsclips
---
Yes but I remember they hinted at a gene skin fore brawloween but it never hapend
---
yeet
---
If you look at my comments you‚Äôd see that‚Äôs far from what my point is. I don‚Äôt hold in disrepute the posters skill, however, painting over isn‚Äôt as hard as you think if you have the patience and the know-how. People trace, nothing wrong with it, said that multiple times today. Though there‚Äôs something to be said of people who call others ‚Äúdog shit‚Äù without any understanding of the situation.
---
This is a unique post according to repostsleuthbot but why do you keep on thinking Reddit are dumb? There is no reason to tell this is a repost. That Jessie picture had so many similarities to online picture and that goggles outright a photoshop. I can see why people "dissing" it but it's not unintentional, they have a point to make fun of it.
---
Sorry for being toxic on this post. I was just fed up with all the bs that people were spreading.
---
That bull should have just took the spring trap back tho
---
cauz she can super stack since there will be many bralwers there
---
This got on the [meme review](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ)

A swear I will roll over any other brawler that comes over
---
El Primo will die when he uses his super on him
---
nice one
---
It is all of the things in brawl stars, but in alphabet form.
---
So? This is common when you play with randoms
---
Some of the things I found took many hours to find and some were not that good because of that.
---
You won‚Äôt be saying that after the crow remodel. Mark my words... hopefully
---
Can someone tell me his username
---
I'll  give  you diamond  when it released
---
saya pun malaysian orang la, abang
---
Same XD
---
yeah my first thought was that this is fake. the face looks way too real to be drawn.
---
Great to have you mastering a somewhat high skill required brawler.
---
This problem has been happening to a lot of people for now. I see this post every time by different people. In the next update, brawl stars needs to look into what is causing that problem and try to fix. But my news have always been fine though.
---
r/foundthetoyotacorolla

Poco
---
HeheüòÇ
---
No idea. Right now, Darrl is just all around buggy. He'll even stop short of his normal super length, as I've personally experienced. 
---
Bot to mention when they changed the position where his hurt boxes generate from (his center as opposed to left and right), it made this weird gap in the furthest part of his main attack that prevents you from actually hitting anything even though he should be.
---
Not trying to bring up another arguement but I would just like to point out that people are taking your post the wrong way. I dont know of you've seen the comments but theres alot of hate towards the artwork. Again, just pointing that out.
---
What app is this
---
it‚Äôs not your fault. Here is a warm hug. &lt;3
---
yeah something really did seem rong

No sorry i don't wanna hug

repost from elprimo gang

you layered images. You didn‚Äôt draw the face.

Remodel? Probably El Primo, even though it isn‚Äôt that bad... Reanimation? Gene, it looks horrible and I hope they change it back
---
The teeth always looks strange
---
No Gingerbread House 8-Bit and Christmas Carol Poco
---
Yes the thing is because if this, people think that i stole, i used photoshop filter to make it look like drawing, i lied, and i am lazy so i just slap the picture there and edit it. Like i am some kind of criminal underserving to live. But ok.
---
Happy cake day
---
And?
---
Listen dude your art is amazing, you should be honored that its so good people dont believe it. You have my support, but dont let the bullies shit up your amazing work
---
Mhm

And I'm assuming you're voting for Penny?

Ok then

---
80% damage reduction? Over 2000 damage Per attack? Perfectly balanced...
---
so make your point

Will power. Just don‚Äôt open them if you want to save boxes. If you‚Äôre talking about people with maxed accounts, it‚Äôs easy, they don‚Äôt get anything worthwhile from boxes. Otherwise open them or don‚Äôt, it‚Äôs all up to you.
---
I‚Äôve seen. I get why people would feel that way, actually, I can understand both sides but it doesn‚Äôt justify the insults and attacks. That, I don‚Äôt get.

Yo wtf

---
Again, i used the model image and paint it as a reference. If it‚Äôs only a layered image, you can see it from the zoom in version. But anyway, if people already think it is a layered image then there is nothing that i can do.

Anyways, I always think outside the box. If you can't even understand logical contradiction, I give up.
---
Man, I‚Äôve just come to terms with the fact that legendaries don‚Äôt actually exist and that everyone playing them are just bots. It helps me cope.
---
Yeah I had to kind of think about it. Thanks.
---
Don't worry. Some day you will get it.
---
Thats the name in dutch
---
idk Im opposite
---
Pretty funny how all the kids here get so fucking worked up because someone traced a part of the artwork. LMAO
---
I don't agree with this. Last season Igot 2900+ and I still buy mega boxes
---
Honestly, I didn‚Äôt expect it to get so many upvotes. I posted it because my friend said it looks descent and he asked me to post my work on reddit. I also made some clays before that he asked me to post here. When i woke up this morning, I was shocked when i saw one person spammed his link under all comments. Too many people already thought that it‚Äôs photoshopped. l because of that person and a misunderstanding of your post. I have also explained to some people and they think that i lied. Thanks for clarifying it tho. Appreciate it. I always thought that i am not good enough that‚Äôs why i am against sharing. I don‚Äôt gain anything by posting my work anyway. Maybe 2k people like the post but i myself regret that i shared it here. I thought the body and backPack are still sloppy, thought of giving more details on it but it was already late last night so i posted it to ask for some opinions. I didn‚Äôt expect getting so many dramas over one post. Ok, it‚Äôs time to move on now. Thanks for liking it anyway.

---
‚ÄúDrew‚Äù is such a subjective word. Many people who trace consider that drawing, and the shading in isn‚Äôt easy even with a previous image. People are getting on their high horse because they assumed one thing and the result didn‚Äôt meet their expectations, but OP didn‚Äôt use any language that others haven‚Äôt used in the past.

These kind of posts are getting repetitive. No offense but it‚Äôs starting to annoy me. Please stop.

The way they are designed makes it easy for them to team. Esp. Dynamike, they don't fear betrayal they much when they group. On the opposite side, you rarely see shotgunners teaming...

Mama J looks much younger there. Nice artwork!

It was the only brawler to get a nerf after 24h as an emergency, and it wasn't even enough lol
---
You have the spirit
---
Reddit is uh.. cool, I guess? I‚Äôve only been here for a year and I don‚Äôt think that the Brawl Stars community is that great. Or the subreddit, at least.
---
It took supercell 3 nerfs to make her super only 3 seconds.. But she is still a top 10 brawler
---
je putain de vie en france

Will you actually get epic win? I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs considered a win since you didn‚Äôt destroyed their safe.
---
Yes but I kind of lost the motivation to push the Brawlers to 550 or higher
---
Oh Tick, the worst brawler in the game, right next to Jessie
---
Deleted. F
---
I'm not talking about the previous update, but the game release last December
---
Yes yes yes
---
in the november brawl talk they said they were already working on the december update so i guess 12th december or few days before it, on 12th december we have brawl stars global birthday
---
Hmm how do we do that then...
---
Brawl Stars Talk , but it isnt from Supercell
---
Thank you
---
During a talk in the recent World's Finals, they said that in 12th December we will have something new. But that's all. Brawl Stars was released globally 12th December 2018.
---
Brawl talks usually comes out on Mondays, and a spanish youtuber (Spiuk) who was brought there by SuperCell, said that any monday can be the Brawl talk day, so:
---
I'm guessing that as 12th December is next week's Thursday, and there will be something, as SuperCell said, we will be getting a Brawl talk next Monday 9th December. Around that day. May be Tuesday. 
---
Then, the update will be around Wednesday 11th or Thursday 12th. 
---
 
---
There's another option, and is to continue with the "late month update" trend, then may be a Brawl talk on Thursday 12th and get the full update on Saturday 14th or Monday 16th, but that is very unlikely. I stand with the 9th and 12th prediction.

what that means

How many skin are you buy with the gem in box?all my skin is buy with the gem in the box.

I paid for my skins because like I mentioned before you are a poor crying baby, and I am not. What country are you in? I have a feeling that would explain everything lol

Why Don't you take a screen shot of your winning round and send to me?
---
It‚Äôs ok neither am I so don‚Äôt worry about that :)

I juste feel that you may express yourself however you want as long is it does not break TOS. (Nazism, racism, etc). Being vulgar in my eyes, while it may be immature is totally acceptable since you are not hurting anyone.

Because I don‚Äôt care if you have more wins then me. My life isn‚Äôt sad like yours üòÇ

---
No they are regular skins
---
So i guess you are too poor to have a PC?
---
To be star player, does not mean to hold onto one gem,  you should get the most kills and help your teammates, so they can stay alive. So that is the way to be star player at ( only )  GEM GRAB.

---
its POCO u smart boi#
---
u/i forgot his name
---
You get what you deserve
---
Probably sometime within the next week or so they‚Äôll announce it
---
takedown is very op at 800+
---
Oh they are teammates!

Wath the heck it s your problem with the new skins it s like i see down on this reddit page 
---

thanks for using my meme and adding credit. For doing this ill follow u RocketPadGamer . But one question r u new??
---
You know about bad connexion ?
---
Because he love bibi so much
---
Dude calm down I just wanted to show some gratitude tu supercell for this super skins
---
0.3++?
---
Good choice
---
Thanks for understanding!! I was getting so pissed because of that idiot
---
That is true, but he doesnt have to always be like a top 3 brawler or similar. He was like that for a long time (for example when he was first released, he was a top brawler for quite a long time)
---
Cuz he is a man of culture
---
To be fair, Colt is the best brawler for takedown, so you're only following the meta in the end.
---
Good job Sam!
---
Or the 8-bit lazerfield?
---
Oh god oh fuck it's the brawl stars cactus
---
This deserves more attention! Just amazing!
---
What does my girlfriend and Leon have in common?
---
They're both invis...sike they're both kids.
---
I agree with you. Maybe I was too resentful.
---
Np. This kid might  be replying on the wrong sub.
---
ƒ±ts super dude
---
True ü§£
---
I disagree
---
Gg :)
---
Oof, üëã
---
Ayy I also don't have legendaries and pulled my last remaining powerpoints on Monday.
---
and there it is, the complaings about no getting updates, this is toxic you know
---
Wow, just wow. Nobody was trying to kill other players. Hopefully I can some day have similar experience.
---
Wait That 2 boxes have the same health 40
---
I was thinking like a monster a
---
Slime with a axe called TOD he is a tank(I know it's my name-_-) 
---
Rarity:leggendary
---
Health :5400 (lvl10) 
---
Main attack crazy axe: he slash three times like a combo the first two are normal slashes like Bibi the third one is a circle spin 
---
Max damage (lvl 10) : 1¬∞and 2¬∞ 540 last spin 1000
---
Super berserker : he throws the axe in one direction dealing 1000
---
(7 tiles) trasforming in to a bigger monster adding 7000 max health slamming fists like  Nita's bear 3 times that deal 1000 each
---
When he is in that form he can't be healed after he's health goes to 0 the super runs up and ends  turning Normal he won't die but he is super tired so he's dmg is reduced for 5 sec 
---
Passive:TOD  has a strong super but to charge it you need to take damage and after berserk u need to wait 10 sec to use it again
---
STAR power:
---
Light axe : every time you attack you attack 20% faster than the first attack
---
JuggerTOD (juggernaut+TOD) :when TOD trasform in berserk mode
---
He is immune to stun ad knockback for all the duration
---
And that's my idea
---
let em rp, its not gonna hurt anyone
---
They‚Äôre both imaginary

i think they havent updated the flairs since like september
---
she isn't although she can be good is bushy showdown maps and snake prairies and some brawl ball maps she is really bad in other because she just gets outranged easily and can't do anything
---
As a fellow creature of the night, I appreciate the kid's work! Well done! Take care!
---
No
---
8 bit
---
This hurts my eyes just looking at it
---
**WHERE DO YOU SEE EDIT???**
---
No, this is Patrick
---
This power...HES TO LUCKY TO BE LEFT AT MEGA BOXES
---
Imposable being op for this because this will only count for teamers
---
anybody who can aim will take people out at range with Shelly. Primo out damages her but Shelly's super pushes primo away while either killing or heavily damaging him making him easy pickings. And so what if she wasn't used at the championship, people main different brawlers because they like that brawler
---
u ndermine?

thata drawing sucks

---

---

---
I hope they make short animate for any new brawler in the future
---
800+ upvotes for taking a screenshot
---
I thought leonard was a boy
---
Trophies
---
Down Syndrome patient dude.. Do you expect higher level drawing like "Mona Lisa" art?
---
I like that idea. but what if Leon campes there for the rest of the match?
---
Also so Star power does not get out of control, maybe he walks slower when going through the walls, just saying.
---
I appreciate all of your support!
---
Silky Sounds / Theifs Territory / Piper's Gardens / - my suggestions
---
This is the same way I got both of Pam's powers
---
I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs a bad drawing I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs a bad concept to be put in the game
---
I can't understand this community. They say "So many shitpost on this reddit" but man, who just post screenshot, get 1k upvotes ( i don't have anything against author, just fact)
---
Colt looks so depressed

Showdown is littered with crappy maps, especially Cavern Churn, Flying Fantasies, and Royal Runway
---
Yes, but damages are there, and also star power. In showdown that make less differences thanks to power cubes but others modes..

Yea dude, it's me.

Proof : Leonita is just the worst ship that ever existed, is such a disgusting and imoral thing to ship Leonita when you are aware that they are siblings and if you don't know, incest can lead to mutants, very dangerous genetical diseases and in general the imorality of the whole idea of imbreeding like the royalities thinking this is the only way they can keep their royal blood (called blue blood) making their kid's life an insuportabile pain because of the diseases.
---
Lmao, now you can be sure.
---
Nope, Brawl Stars responded to that question on Twitter
---
I would've bought them if they were limited
