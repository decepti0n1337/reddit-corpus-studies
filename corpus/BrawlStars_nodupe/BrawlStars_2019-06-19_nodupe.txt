This is a repost and it's late lol. Nobody even said he needed a buff.

---
Yea sorry I was a bit harsh. It's a little annoying in general seeing humor posts that either don't exactly relate to that many people/aren't funny. I think if you had added: Nice trophies, or a caption like that, it would've made sense to begin with.

I totally agree. Thanks for the feedback.
---
You get the meme atleast
---
:v
---
True, better than mortis in heist though, yet no one seems to meme that (no offence to your flair, I worship mortis)
---
Please express your thoughts, I 'd love to hear them!
---
For the last time , Its just a  meme, im actually good at siege
---
Ficou top mano, s√≥ que eu n√£o aguento mais skin do Brock ,_,

His super goes over walls
---
There is always a bigger fish
---
I swear to god its just. A shiting meme
---
Exactly then maybe only one dynamike and barley will team per nap instead of 3-4
---
Well. This got out of hand a bit, that your can be sure of.
---
Well that‚Äôs a fact though... and it‚Äôs part of the joke
---
If Mortis of all brawlers is getting a buff, then nita and gene need a buff
---
I absolutely hate how everything in the game besides the weekly special events are ladder. I can‚Äôt play my high trophy brawlers because of the risk of losing trophies on them. And I avoid game modes like gem grab because of these reasons - that it‚Äôs so easy to lose trophies and it‚Äôs non casual
---
So do bo‚Äôs and Brock‚Äôs and Tara‚Äôs, does that make them throwers too?
---
Would upvote but no sound.
---
ü§î
---
Whatever... But I don't need an advice... So stfu Mr 300 IQ brat!
---
Wow so original... I wish people can come up with different jokes and meme formats sometimes...
---
Thanks for your advice
---
0 LOSSES 0 DEATHS! Good meme btw and high effort!
---
Exactly this. There's simply no real way to play casually as it is. Ladder should be for more competitive players and for rewards, and casual mode should be for casual players.
---
Accuracy at it's finest, also that hina with mortis's hat thou
---
pleasee make more
---
Yes please. Casual mode would be really cool and I would like a way to earn keys without any risk just playing casually.

Were you trying to steal Sam's skin?
---
I had a dynamike in dou showdown respawn on me mid fight and just start trying to double jump spoiler alert he failed every time and we ended up dying also before he respawned he just ran off to his death
---
Shit like this is why i dislike 3v3 or dous
---
F
---
Wasn‚Äôt this done before? Looks like a reeepost to me
---
Thanks man. Also yeah I'm also hoping some maps will make a return too!
---
No i thought that you had a colt pun to everything
---
I like the idea, but with the game being widely playable without touching trophies maybe their should be a depreciation on all trophies at the end of season? Because you could get a lot of gameplay out of the non competitive scene and still hold a large sum of trophies , counter incentive might be nice in this situation. Perhaps a progressive tax like system on individual brawler trophies would work? (maybe not multiple brackets but one for 0-499 and one for 500+ for starters). All trophies now seasonally depreciate but not at the same rate. A boost to season rewards with this system would be nice too.
---
Also, a rework for the brawler ranking system would compliment these changes as there is no way to go down a rank, and the first 10 or so ranks are essentially meaningless. The inability to be demoted also makes tilted brawlers more visually frustrating. 
---
Nice.
---
Well lets hope june update will! Bone tinnel, cactus corridor, all were good
---
I absolutely loved Bone tunnel and cactus corridor. Big F and respect to the creators of the maps.
---
Grammar
---
This is a very goo, immersive artwork!  I think the only big improvement would be the shading on the water, but shading on water is extremely difficult.
---
GREAT artwork!!
---
But I get why they need to get rid of some maps, we can't have millions of maps in the rotation pool
---
Some maps rn aren't in the pool even!
---
Dont ever think you win
---
I got a mythic which I don‚Äôt like before I got an epic and I still don‚Äôt have an epic yet
---
Just to be clear, I‚Äôm not the owner. I made a memes with the [template](https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/c1lvh4/art_uploaded_this_template_because_why_not/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app)  riochann gave us, same as Sporklez.
---
Nah this is hilarious, good job.
---
*pulls you in with their magic hand*
---
I made a theory a while ago and if it is correct, then the maps who are less frequent on the rotation are the ones planned to be removed.
---
Also, I seriously hope they are able to increase the map capacity in the game a bit more.
---
I tryed
---
Yeah, she didn‚Äôt even regenerate health, way too cocky
---
you're welcome c:
---
i remember energy drink, what I dont remember is Canal Grande. someone send me the map plz.
---
I agree with a lot of these changes as that is a big problem. However I did provide an incentive of only having one casual mode on at a time. If that plus season rewards is enough incentive then we wouldn‚Äôt need season trophy depreciation for brawlers less than 500
---
Yes 
---
Imma bit bored of constant same maps coming 
---
I legit memorized all maps in the rotation üòÇ
---
The dynmike should have been fight spinner
---
Yeah, because we don't want to simplify competitive to make it more competitive, since that would just mean the death of variety, team=win and nice clips.

Then crosspost it there then

have a nice day for you too
---
Yes, but like the buff should b, a little more super healing or so, because he is an assassin, and thus  supposed to go after those weak brawlers, he isn't a tank killer like Shelly

Oh and is posting your first 10 lvl brawler or complaining about randoms original and high effort? Why are you so twisted man

---
Power level absolutely should not matter. If it did, you eliminate any incentive to level up. If I know I can wreck power 1 noobs, why level up my brawlers? 
---
And organized teams absolutely should be matched with random teams. Organized vs random also shouldn‚Äôt matter much. What should matter is a weight of total trophies and individual brawler trophies. Just because some Shelly main has 500+ trophies on shelly and 2k total doesn‚Äôt mean their skill with shelly belongs in a game with someone like me who has 26 brawlers at 500+(and 3 over 600). 
---
Here‚Äôs how I would fix matchmaking 
---
Everything gets divided by 100. So for example, I queue in as a random with my 550 trophy penny. I‚Äôm at 13.5k total. My penny trophies put me at 5.5 and my total trophies puts me at 135. More weight, however, is placed on total trophies. 60% for total and 40% for brawler. So my new brawler number is 2.2 and my total trophy number is 81 for a total of 83.2. The game then tries match me with people within 15 points of that mark. After a minute, if it can‚Äôt find 2 other people to pair with me, it tells me that it‚Äôs unable to find a match. It then offers to allow me to wait longer or expand the range of people it‚Äôs looking to find to say 25. Expanding the range will almost guarantee I‚Äôll get a match quickly. But if I have time(almost always do when I‚Äôm playing), I would wait every single time. 
---
When determining opposition, the game uses the same formula to find teams that are within the same range. This is where organized vs random comes into play. Organized teams will receive and additional 10 points for every player in the team(so either 20 or 30, depending on if 2 or 3 queued in together). What this will essentially do is have organized slightly lower trophy player playing randoms with slightly higher trophies. I believe this would result in fair matches most of the time. 
---
These changes would allow fair matchmaking for higher end players like me who maybe just want to earn a star token and not invite 2 people to play 1 or 2 gems. It also ensures that lower level players aren‚Äôt gonna be matched with higher level players who will slaughter them. Right now, nobody wins with the matchmaking.

---
I absolutely hate how I can barely use my favourite brawlers because they‚Äôre too high trophy. And after enough time goes by I want to ‚Äúwarm up‚Äù before I start risking trophies. So now I‚Äôm constantly playing as my worst brawlers because they‚Äôre lowest trophies.
---
I‚Äôve also noticed I get a sinking feeling inside when I go on a crazy winning streak with a brawler, because I know this is the last time I‚Äôll get to use him/her once they reach unchill trophy levels üò£
---
But he is a vampire!

This is the

Imagine this in bounty lmfao
---
I really like the idea of a casual mode. It would also make for a more realistic way to practice with brawlers instead of the training cave with just stationary targets. I don't think however supercell will add this into the game just so people can play their high trophy brawlers without fear of losing trophies. That kind of defeats the propose of trophies imo. Though I can see it happening for any of the other reasons you listed. They are all great points and hopefully we will get to play something like this.

Sounds like a steam problem. Maybe valve should increase the profit. Not allow any shovelware to end up on its store, etc. competition is good. Drives innovation. People were upset about steam as the only option, another option enters and then everyone complains. There are three major consoles fighting it out- and it drives costs of 3rd party games down which is great for consumers. Completion will drive steam to make a better user experience too and finally update that launcher.

I have to play with a bull and a piper that auto aim the whole match

Our team get like 12 stars and the other get like 34 stars 
---
AND you know what is even worst after that they pressed play again
---
the shitty brawl stars sub. doesn‚Äôt seem to be anything wrong with it
---
Problem is: Gene and Lvl 10 Barley will cause lots of unfairness because Gene‚Äôs attack is so easy to hit a target, while infected Lvl 10 Barley can stay alive permanently as long as he keeps on wasting his attacks, so this mod will do nothing if Lvl 10 Barley is the one being infected, and Gene will pretty much never get infected. Also if you‚Äôre playing Duos, it‚Äôll do no effect if the infected brawler‚Äôs teammate is a Lvl 10 Poco which will just spam attacks on the infected teammate 
---
While I believe this is a good mod idea, we need to do some certain brawlers (Pam is fine because she needs to get her super)
---
you‚Äôre alrdy very blessed to have Leon be grateful, my 13k friend doesn‚Äôt have any legend -.-

Well what I can suggest is make it so that players can only get tokens and star tokens from playing ranked modes and playing casual does not hurt their trophy level. Sometimes I just want to get to a match and have some fun with my brawlers without worrying about losing trophies. Although I would really like to implement this to the events first because sometimes I just want to play events even when I don‚Äôt have tickets. I don‚Äôt play the game for the progression only, I play it for fun too.

Why they rempve that map,it was so good!

I could see them adding more to friendly battles. It would be cool to make a friendly lobby and play against randoms instead of just bots if you can't fill a game.

The placement may skmehow work, maybe that Bo is some sort of time traveler who knows what will happen next (Ok this is not possible... Randoms are Randoms)

Keep her alive until late game. Her super is more useful when you can pull many players together. Until then, try to survive and avoid confrontation with brawlers.

Ooo infection for bs that would actually be dope, I think it‚Äôd be cooler for a ticketed event where you start out as maybe bo(? Cause he‚Äôs decently tanky, has fair range, and has his mine traps) and someone is randomly selected to be crow and each bo that gets killed also becomes a crow

randoms who are teamers that backstab

U mean 69 zeros

Absolutely awesome!

Congrats, the first smart thing uve said lol

You mean making it cost real money

Instead of fixed damage, i think the infection should be fixed %, or else low hp brawlers wont stand much of a chance.

basically long-range without the need to aim?

Everywhere I go. I see his face

I think that would be to powerfull.With the spees buff and with the damage buff people with infection will just engage into fights with a huge advantage.

I mean if one of your teammates is AFP you can‚Äôt get as many kills and the other just farmed him as free kills and we would have to protect him. Not the ideal thing at all.

I got Mortis from a brawl box 2 days ago :P

I did once end up on 666 trophies but forgot to take a picture about that one though.

Yep thats me Right there

ur right

Both get the infection.

Dude attacking someone is against the rules not cool
---
We wait  new update... We want new maps, new minigames, new skins, modifications of brawlers, maps, etc. Brawl Stars, resolve what I told you, fast, please. I have no patience. I want the June Update to come sooner.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
Nice idea
---
other memes include BONK, pootis, failed rocketjump, ect.
---
Ok
---
Siege best mode
---
Bonk? It is not the scout it is bibi
---
He looks like a Terraria boss
---
Eh
---
What if two people stay out of view and just leech off each other, mostlikely, crows
---
I see Bibi as a female scout with a weird bat and skin
---
This is not just Brawl stars related, it's related to every single subreddit ever
---
Oh really, crap
---
I don‚Äôt play siege with my high trophy brawlers. It‚Äôs too risky
---
&gt; so yeah her canon age is 15
---
You tried to pass it off as a fact. Don't make absurd claims if you have no evidence to back them up, that's all.
---
He does look nice, not gonna lie.
---
I make mistakes but I play smart and don‚Äôt make game breaking mistakes. And the other team does it too. So tell me why you say everyone else is bad randoms because I think you lose a lot too and you blame yourself instead of the el primo jumping and giving 10 gems to your opponents or a Colt with 20 gems auto aiming not hitting a single shot and runs forward instead of running back.

Ah yes, who doesn't like My MoM vS mY dAd

---
You were inspired by Terraria, right?
---
First of all, you‚Äôre not forgiven for your English.  That‚Äôs a filthy language and you should be ashamed for using it.  But you did speak it well.
---
And I like your idea.  Boss fight maps are fun because someone gets singled out and given super powers.  Having a game mode where you can pass the powers to someone else who will then be singled out in some way would be cool.  I‚Äôd give a bonus of some kind to whoever manages to kill the infected person, like a free power point and immunity from infection for a short time.
---
Tara is great in brawl ball.
---
Is rosa allowed in Mortis gang?
---
Not my tier-list dude...
---
Usually in this kind of situation, you have to apologize to the original artist and delete the post.‚òπ
---
U tried that......
---
You're a enemy of ppl 
---
Jk lol
---
Flair doesn‚Äôt check out
---
Kairos‚Äô their list is just showing where the brawlers are in the meta and Darryl is super vulnerable without his super and can‚Äôt do anything unless he is super close to someone. Shelly can clap anyone with her super
---
What about pushing trophies
---
Have you seen Kairos's tier list? He's been ranked as the fifth worst brawler by a set of nearly twenty pro players. If they think he's bad, he's probably bad. The pros have much more experience than pretty much everyone, and will all know how to play each brawler, including mortis. They are playing him correctly, and still think that he is bad. And you're saying that he doesn't need a buff?
---
No
---
Okay, it sounds like you have an above-avarage skill level then if you have him pushed up that far. The majority of the player base will never come close to that level (including myself). Which is probably why the overall consensus is that he's underpowered in his current state. There's probably only a very small fraction of people that have him at 500 and above.
---
How the heck did you push him up that far? Pre-made team?
---
400 trophies isn‚Äôt that hard to get. And your ‚Äúinsane replay‚Äù isn‚Äôt that insane unless you‚Äôre playing against people that actually know what they‚Äôre doing
---
Ok thanks
---
I meant like new brawler
---
Lol imagine one rico having the poison and al the other brawlers rumning away from him
---
I
---
Haven't u seen this meme format before , It's me the final skull is the stupid guys
---
Hahaha couldn't help myself sorry!
---
you realize he could‚Äôve pushed other brawlers after losing all those on piper right...
---
...It's a joke.
---
Duo queued with a friend in Excel bounty. Maybe you're right, it's a little hard to balance Mortis across all skill levels, especially while auto aim exists.
---
Yes do it!
---
Is that 2521? I think I‚Äôve heard of hi
---
I like silent Tara tho... So misterious
---
so you must click on it to see it 
---
also you dont skip it  when you are in r/Brawlstars  home page !
---
Nope.
---
That's ass
---
I gotta be honest, its really hilarious to win with hyper aggro non rosa gem carrier lol
---
I am such a üêîüêì I haven't tried it
---
Afghanistan Shely
---
and i have remouved nsfw now ! :)
---
Who? Please provide link
---
No...just no...because EVERYONE keeps their range against shellies. And also checks bushes. Thats why shelly is actually good in lower trophies. Because noone knows how to kepp their range and check the bushes...while in higher trophy ranges its easy to counter her by keeping you range and checking bushes. And also can shelly kill any lower to mid health brawlers like colt, rico, dynamike, piper, gene etc? No. But darryl can. And remember that his super even charges without the need of doing damage.So darryl is the winner here. Gg lol
---
YES ! BE SMART, DONT WASTE YOUR TIME
---
Just channel your Poco energy and scream "AAAAAH" while kiting them
---
How can you possibly drop with 3600 trophies
---
Thanks for teaching me master! you deserve a silver.. well done
---
Instead of 60 it is 5 seconds
---
Yes, Tara does need a remodel, a voice, and a skin. But no, that's not to say you should keep making unfunny memes about it and flooding the sub with it.
---
Nah , i think it could be some thing like 20 seconds
---
In the first 5 seconds none could teaming
---
The turets and the deployebels wont be infected,and they cant pas the infection.
---
I can't tell if you think that I, as well as all the pro players, youtubers, and the community are dumb, or if you are the least intelligent person I have ever seen.
---
Shelly:tank killer
---
Daryl:assasin
---
2 different types of brawlers. There is no point in talking about who can counter different ranges.
---
Wouldn‚Äôt 20 seconds me too long(especially for low health brawlers who might get easily killed)
---
Lol thx
---
Did you get a brawler?
---
He‚Äôll erase 50% of the balance changes with his daggers
---
Bruh you're gonna die
---
Ya
---
I didn't watch endgame lol
---
It‚Äôs not supercell. It is that those people are in a party with someone really low, and they don‚Äôt want the high person to play very low people. And if anything you should be happy, because you matched against the low trophy people.
---
Removed - DO NOT SUBMIT POSTS WITH TITLES IN ALL CAPS. CAPS LOCK IS CRUISE CONTROL FOR COOL
---
Woah
---
She's stupid in siege I want her
---
frick you
---
Life leach was not only a good counter to teaming, but it was also fun, if you play it right
---
WHAT! DO YOU WORK FOR EA?
---
As I was explaining this is something supercell can‚Äôt do but only recommend. If they were to do this many people would be very mad at supercell as they sometimes play with people that are very low on trophies. Even if they were to do this, it would basically outride the whole game. Matchmaking would take longer, and game rooms would have to be changed to fit the needs of this. This problem is something supercell is going to have to change many parts of the game to get to the desired gameplay level, the UI of the game would have to be swapped because of this problem and many people would be mad at this fix even though there is not any better ways to fix this problem.

Well your underrated you should be in the top of hot

umm, Bush Camping is a strategy

Yes

Well sry about that, I saw a post with this clip yesterday and saw that you reposted.

NOTE: This is a reupload of my own video, but the original post was almost two months ago. I'm reuploading in hopes that I can receive more feedback, I'm not sure if it was because I uploaded at a busy time and it got lost in the kerfuffle or a slower time and it didn't reach a larger audience. This is something I'm generally passionate about so it would be greatly appreciated. Original description is as follows:
