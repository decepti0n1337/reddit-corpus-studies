---
Major bruh moment
---
I agree, he's boring, the last few brawlers they released have been boring tbh, bibi and rosa...
---
No, string is just a computing term, like boolean, the string is used in this case as the header for the brawlers name

f for bo, he turn american too much

i know üòÄ that was 8 hours ago

OMG MY SUPER IDEA MADE IT IN!!! (or maybe it was just a coincidence...)
---
He needs a buff so he is even slightly usable at close range, and he needs a series of LARGE, LARGE NERFS IN ALL OTHER AREAS.

Content: Just stolen clips fromr reddit

Most are credited tho

Maybe it'll be glitched like all the glitches today
---
I got 13,000 but couldn't use them, it's just a glitch everyone will get them withings 24 hours they've said, cant wait for mecha crow
---
Ok I understand now
---
~~When a soutg korean accidentally step on to north korea~~
---
Ticks will be the next dynamike, change my mind
---
Yeah, I imagine him being a drunk dad outside a baseball game throwing sticks at people
---
It's stickied right at the top three hours ago
---
What do you guys think* not how ahh
---
Thx for the info
---
Tick.
---
Is.  
---
So.  
---
ANNOYING.
---
you‚Äôre not the OP. What did you do to get 150 gems?
---
When you‚Äôre surrounded by 4 ticks
---
Shelly‚Äôs new star power is scary
---
You forgot to add the one maxed tick killing everyone in one shot
---
All that's left is Hoverboard guy and Hurricane for now
---
ok
---
Also Similar reward as 3v3s so NO MORE AVOIDING SIEGE TO KEEP MY TROPHIES YESSSSSS
---
1 event ticket ? That is crazy holy mother of gawd !
---
What‚Äôs his new star power?
---
Wow impressive!!! Congrats!!!
---
And now with the star points it is no longer a damn difficult challenge without rewards!
---
[removed]
---
Haha i just got bo starpower
---
I actually just updated and the timer is there now.
---
But no seriously why dose she keep getting buffed so much
---
No bloody way, that must be a reference
---
It's gonna be fixed alright :) 
---

---
[S] nanah we just need another shelly's super to one-shot that shelly boss. Because belueve me, the super can easily one-shot even a boss
---
Yeahhh justice
---
Awesome, time to rip open the rest then hopefully I get some üòÇ
---
haha same. i played siege only when i had a new brawler xD they really listened to us
---
#Tara is definitely a whale
---
##CONFIRMED
---
I do, it's a fun mode
---
BECAUSE THE GUN IS THE TURRETS' SON
---
Brawl Stats
---
When even the ball gets a skin before Tara
---
Sad times, people thinking battle passes are pay to win, last time I checked having an exclusive skin in brawlstars makes more people try and kill you. Pay to lose more like lol.
---
But when he attacks you hear way more than 4 strings
---
I did played siege everytime to get star token but was too scared because of loss
---
Well its bad for hardcore pushers tho
---
But they did chnage trophy inflation so.... yeah
---
Nothing it‚Äôs only good to flex if you want, because it would be exclusive for tryhards
---
Dude check my profile I recorded brawl ball with 6 ticks and it‚Äôs super nuts
---
It's basically trophy road, but you'd pay like ¬£6 a month to get upgraded rewards and exclusive skins for reaching certain checkpoints.
---
He got a map added probably
---
Did you get the box?
---
Nah, I have this star power, it's not as op as it seems... The cool down is really long and when she gets it, it doesn't save her from fatal hits
---
Louis Sansi
---
I liked it, I just think they should darken the green of the eye a little and the "blue" that surrounds it
---
$100.00*
---
yeah but the op gpt his map added by winning Rey‚Äôs map contest.
---
I also agree but I think a battle pass would be nice, but now we have star points it's really not necessary, they've basically given us all a free battle pass to get exclusive skins by putting lots of time into the game.
---
Me too! Lol thank goodness because I didn't save any boxes.
---
The eye is pretty cool imo, I like how her eye probably makes the noises and not her and the noises are kinda similar to gene's, which kinda makes sense because they both look like they come from the same place
---
Firework
---
How?
---
Who's next?
---
I don‚Äôt know how to feel about Tara‚Äôs voice.
---
He looks like the training cave bot
---
Why not make like cartoonish sound effect for spike. I mean he already is cartoonish.
---
Get those brawlers to rank 10 and 15!!! If you get 4 more brawlers to rank 15 you'll have enough! Good luck
---
They‚Äôre parasites. Search up ticks. Tick is also the name of the new brawler, but I‚Äôm pretty sure you already knew that.
---
Holy fuck i just realized
---
F
---
Amazon Fire hd8
---
more than twice i lost like 50 trophies because of a star token. so in the end i stopped even trying it and ruining my day. felt really bad when i had 9/10 but i was so "scared" i learned some patience too xD
---
Brock: you so lucky!
---
It is reduced to 1/4 health which is still a lot of health.
---
Actually Brawl Ball was introduced with the same update for Tara (and Pam) and when you get the ball it has a sound, so technically speaking, the Ball had a voice for about 1.5 years before Tara‚öΩÔ∏è
---
It‚Äôs ‚ÄúOh your soo lucky‚Äù
---
It's a bug... You will soon get the 'pink stuff' in a few hours
---
Shelly was kinda bad though, so maybe the bad character will balance the op star power like how bo used to be
---
Supercell please add this my life depends on it
---
Haha
---
They fucking added voice lines to tick but not to leon I swear ima fucking kill my self
---
It‚Äôs a great drawing and a good skin idea props to you.
---
Yeah me too, but there will probably be new supercell games by then and 20+new brawlers lol
---
Its not out yet, 3 star powers are released every week
---
This game must have  gave yoi the real feeling of treasure hunt, with mine traps.
---
[Here's a post on it.](https://reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/c1tfu6/brawl_map_maker/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)
---
which voice line?
---
Have you tested it? Wouldn‚Äôt the healing be nerfed?
---
I kept her at low trophies for a reason.
---
Beware of the never ending elo hell in 300 and 400.
---
nice
---
Piper or Primo. Maybe some polishing for Pam, Jessie Frank and Leon
---
Congrats
---
You'll receive them within 1-2 days.

Can u make headless horseman tick cause of his super lol
---
‚ÄúBombs? It‚Äôs yours my friend. As long as you have the Power Cubes‚Äù (it you get the reference you get an imaginary star power for whichever Brawler)
---
Ok cool, the same thing happened to me.
---
i‚Äôm confused? what happened
---
&gt;Maybe your friend needs to open more boxes?
---
I mean‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs kind of a given. He hasn‚Äôt spent any money on the game but has a few brawlers above 500 trophies.
---
Not really
---
#BLBLBLBLBLLL
---
Animal is Rosa üòâ
---
That's a great update! Some star powers are just too OP like the one for Shelly, and some are too weak like for Darryl. But I still appreciate SC's work. New skins, new brawler, new star powers, balance changes, new theme and background music!
---
I went full tilt the other day and lost 50-75 trophies with two brawlers I had pretty high and by the end if just felt like I was getting 10th just to be self deprecating.
---
Yep
---
Shelly's star power must be changed to when she is below 40% helth she starts healing her 300 health per second
---
A mega box is only worth 10 boxes, and you'd get way more from a free brawler than a mega box that probably has nothing in it.
---
I know, but I'm talking about her original one
---
I've been waiting for it for like 3 months now and still nothing
---
Did anyone else notice on thousand lakes that the healing mushrooms don't heal?
---
Only If every other brawler can be ‚Äúmore like Leon‚Äù
---
oh trust me, scroll down a little
---
Will you teach me how did you make this masterpiece? I am really impressed by your every artwork...
---
RIP
---
300, spent 500 on outlaw colt
---
solid skin tbh
---
Common Teamers:  
---
Dynamike (thrower), Barley (thrower)
---
New Brawler:  
---
Tick (thrower)
---
I need someone to carry me up to 4000 trophies :/
---
I'm a brawl ball main and this map really excited me, have to think a lot more about defence should spice things up, congrats and I'm excited to play
---
Do we have to buy it first with gems?
---
Nevermind I found this:
---
https://twitter.com/BrawlStars/status/1143990892778467329
---
He won‚Äôt heal 100 per half second. He‚Äôll survive longer but can‚Äôt infinitely
---
I was on the edge of not getting but ended up with 4014 before Maintenance
---
Oh like how Chaotick showdown has been since the update. And the fact that the star shop isn't working is really ticking me off.
---
Exactly. I figured this out a few games in.
---
Am I he only one who thinks her star power is op as fuck?
---
Darryl gang üòû
---
Ohh
---
Same thing happened to me
---
no
---
damn bro 
---
lucky
---
I like how this chain has obly Bibi Flairs
---
healing mushroom arent healing anymore
---
How much pepto bismol u want
---
the nailed the voices for tick and bibi. tara on the other hand...
---
this actually looks hella good
---
So what happened to those skins ? I got my star points but no skins ? I saw the alternate skin for colt and mecha BO but don't see t anymore
---
The whole map was filled with mines
---
Bruh star shop is/was working when I bought a colt skin I think they are like ultra short timed events
---
bruh üòéüòéüòéüòéüòé
---
the fuck
---
Well, we can't because Big Game isn't available. It's just the thought of it since all her SP says is that she recovers full health when she's under 40% health.
---
read the post
---
what
---
I‚Äôm Jake.... literally
---
Wow that‚Äôs really going out of your way to see that
---
Wowww thanks Sir. ü§óü§©
---
twist and shoot too
---
Ok so I think that you‚Äôre out of new now
---
I would rather need you... For a better digestion
---
I saw their tweet, they're fixing it
---
That's a bug, which the developers are already aware of.
---
https://twitter.com/BrawlStars/status/1143990892778467329?s=09
---
You also got a shoutout to Orange Juice Gaming in his tick vid
---
*ti
---
btw i'm a player at 9k with three 500 brawlers this confuses me
---
Italia!
---
You should get the same amount of star points as Rank 20
---
Tick is so bad
---
Thanks!
---
Best comment, thank you^_^
---
No problem!
---
Looking good
---
Thanks for the star power help.
---
Yeah I know op is.  But the comments in here from other people are implying she will be op in all modes.  Figured this was a good place to also discuss her in all modes since others were dude.
---
They said they would be fixing that withing the next 24 hrs. Same with me.
---
Hopefully very soon because it's really annoying, especially that I'm trying to push Mortis lmao
---
Really nice!!!
---
Well I mean think about it, if you‚Äôre a top player you‚Äôll like to see the skin only on yourself because you‚Äôve earned it, it gives something else for top players to aim for instead of buying everything
---
Ummm
---
How? Leon burst him down
---
Awwwwwww
---
I was gonna say why is know one talking about Bibi's voice
---
Yeah all my friends who don't have Tick have over 1000 points already
---
Attack : Electric Knives
---
Super: Jetpack joyride
---
Damage Per Second: Electricity particles around enemy
---
Well I think that‚Äôs kind of the point. The new star powers allow for new ways to play them, and naturally they‚Äôll be more useful in certain situations than other. 
---
It wouldn‚Äôt be as fun if one was definivly better than the other.
---
The whole game is literally a fucking mine field
---
Cavern churn is bacc!
---
^
---
Now they dont have an excuse to add a tara skin
---
He accepted defeat he is fine
---
Which star power is that?
---
Well,that‚Äôs so true at this point.
---
So if u never got your 4k mega box then RIP üòÇ
---
**L I M I T E D**
---
Atleast give lex credit...
---
I have been SUPER hating this star power.
---
Did you messed with the game files -_-
---
The healing mushrooms aren't working
---
Fortunately, it‚Äôs real this time.
---
Hes a pretty ok unit, hes great at pressuring the opponent to move a specific way
---
I still don't know how they're gonna make a good skin for Tara.  I've never seen a Tara skin that would fit in game.  Even GEDI-KOR's Tara skin wouldn't work in game.
---
Missed opportunity to say they scored a home run
---
me as Tara
---
His super is trash imo. It's so easy to kill.
---
What's broken is how much he slows the game down. It's just not fun to play against. Plus there are so many throwers in every game now. And the horrible matchmaking in this game loves to put throwers with throwers, close range with close range and long range with long range. 
---
Never had I seen more horrendous games than now.
---
Carl too, he blinks his eyes
---
2400, going to Buy Outlaw Colt and then save for Night Mecha Crow (once I unlock Crow)
---
Yes, it‚Äôs a bug. It happened to me, supercell said they‚Äôre going to fix it in th next 24 hours
---
Dude is less tanky than a toy teddy bear, he's gotta have something to scare people off
---
wow! I just realized that a ton of your posts have been featured on r/brawlstars !! Great job!
---
Had been posted b4
---
No problem i dont use it either i just happenes to google brawlstars and saw a tweet
---
why do u have star points? i ve already updated and got tick but no star points
---
I just tried with a couple power cubes and died. Must need a certain amount to survive
---
Its a bug where poison gas don't register as "damage" to stop his healing process
---
yup ‚ù§Ô∏è thanks to all the supporters, some of my works made its way to 'hot' üòç
---
and thank you again!
---
Just a quick question, does it show Frank beside my name? If it does not, how do I put a brawl stars character beside my name
---
CLP... C H I ???
---
A lot star powers are ones you can't really control. They're just meant to be an extra boost to help. Some just have higher skill caps than others because you know the best times to use them. Shelly with band aid is going to be the better option for most situations imo. She basically just has 8000 health for some interactions. In most cases, you won't be trying to use the star power anyway. Like.. ur never trying to take damage, thatd be dumb lol. But when u have it charged it will allow u to make aggressive plays at times, which u can argue is an instance where u control it. U dive in at low health knowing ur getting healed
---
üòÇüòÇ
---
Unreal
---
That edit on Thiccochet is fuckin' hilarious lol üòÇü§£
---
There was a bug where some players didn‚Äôt get any star points. I was lucky enough to get them but I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll get your points soon. They are working to fix this glitch right now.
---
oh ok hope they can fix itüò≠üò≠üò≠
---
*Sad Rico noises
---
That looks like 3 out of 3 to me
---
Epic fails
---
np, i brought you a gift of darkness! (thats supposed to be a good thing XD)
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
r/mortisgang
---
Ummm when I loaded my profile it gave me 2400 star points
---
This is in the game so it's real. Believe it or not
---
Haha I literally just got 4K the fricking day before the update release, and that‚Äôs how I got mortis
---
i didnt get anything
---
Can‚Äôt wait for it then. Will drop gems on this no matter what
---
You better be on hot üî•
---
This deserves a platinum.
---
I mean it's quite the polar opposite of true...
---
Brawl stars accounts can be maxed quite easily without a dime spent...
---
The creature of the night has noticed my potential
---
We thank you by firing our cannons. r/pennygang
---
Aww thank you
---
Make it so it‚Äôs disabled in big game, anyone?
---
nice :)
---
Lol wrong and I don‚Äôt think of my self highly I just was pointing out that you were stating the obvious
---
How did you export the 3D models?
---
I've noticed that, at least  in the brawlball games I've played, you can just throw your 3 attacks near the ball  and nobody can get close to the ball or your side of the map.
---
You don‚Äôt have to downvote it ;(
---
When you‚Äôre in a quiet room with a clock
---
I just realised, our gangs are allied! What a true gift of darkness!
---
#DUMPLINGDARRYL
---
I pity the fool
---
The bear's attack speed is 50% faster. I bought it in the shop today for my girl, Nita mains rise up :D
---
I‚Äôd say new
---
This happened to me, I just unlocked crow today when I was looking for some star powers then I just play showdown and the game was a whole minefield.
---
Sup
---
Maybe Israel
---
i opened 180 boxes and didnt got one of them and i maxed out
---
Pass. I have MORE than enough points. What I don't have is the gold to upgrade the guys I get points for
---
I've been playing since 2017, and let me tell you- You're lucky to have unlocked both legendaries that early on...
---
So many people who've played since beta still don't even have one legendary. 
---
Your expectations were set high because you were insanely lucky, but your expectations are far above normal
---
Our trophy levels( tick weak)
---
Am I a no one????
---
That means the eye is some sort of pet? And that means...it needs a name!!!
---
Would also like to point out that healing mushrooms are broken
---
Cause her gun is her BF's baby and she is nursing it
---
Thats not that bad, just gotta wait for supercell to get off their monthly break, then let them make maps, skins, and a brawler for the new update, and hope Frank hosts a Q&amp;A so he will see buff requests, which is like.... 6 months at least, I can wait
---
^^^^as they buff pam..
---
Morgz wants to know your location
---
Road rage did too
---
What do you mean, she's already silent
---
Im serious this would be a great idea
---
My question tho: Where did that portal come from!?
---
Mission accomplished respect +1000
---
Since when were illiteracy and fat shaming commonplace?
---
Where do u make maps?
---
I like  bibis voice tho
---
My English Xd
---
Me too lol
---
So we need an name for the eye right? Right?
---
I‚Äôll join if you lower the trophies needed. I‚Äôm at like 3200-3300.
---
is there a tara skin in the code?
---
Ah shit here we go again
---
Of ALL the maps in rotation, thousand lakes?? When Tick is released? Evil Supercell.
---
They lied to us!
---
Do you get tokens for when the season ends?
---
Pretty much useless 9/10 times
---
I almost doubled my gems today. I had like 23 yesterday now I have 42
---
I hope u understand how hurt I'm
---
This is actually in the game.
---
Ok I can do that
---
I mean, I have 103 normal plus 11 big.
---
Same, I was so used to edgy Tara.
---
Bro it was out like 7 hours ago
---
I opened 110 boxes get like 90 gems
---
Just made it because this mortis is the one I was talking about to you yesterday... To become the ultimate, he killed em all except one... And for the last one, he opened a portal to find the last survivor
---
Jessie also blinks
---
It seems to be living. The eye moves, has emotions, so I guess it‚Äôs alive? But I agree on a name. If I were to give it a name, I would suggest Luna. Seems fitting for it in my opinion.
---
personally prefer AC but HD is cool too
---
That's a pretty lax policy,  doesn't show much pride in their product.  
---
The player is trash,  I can't stand that shit.
---
I hope the Tick madness ends soon
---
Day 1 is : T I C K.  H E L L. 
---
Day 2 is : COUNTER HELL. (Mortis everywhere)
---
Day 3 is H E L L
---
Day 4 is Brawl Stars once again but with some Ticks
---
Damn that‚Äôs wild
---
Oh yeah I was in your band dark warriors way back then
---
Damn frank star power is sooo creative
---
Thanks for appreciating my map!
---
Woah I hope there's a star points version
---
the enemy team huddled together for an easy team KO
---
I don't have an issue for the surprise being spoiled for me or others; however, Supercell devs worked hard on the skin yet you go against their wishes (by messing around in the files and then leaking the skin afterwards) and that's just disrespectful.
---
So at the end of the season, do I get star points for the brawlers that are at ranks 10 and 15 or is it just a one time thing (getting star points for reaching rank 10 or 15)
---
At least she is not laughing like carl
---
CamperüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
I joined too many clubs today I guess so it‚Äôs not letting me join. I‚Äôll join it tomorrow
---
Maybe cause everyone wants to play him since he just came out
---
Still hasn‚Äôt let me update:(
---
I agree. People are complaining she doesn‚Äôt speak and just goes mhmhmhm. But I love that about her. She seems ominous and seems like a person who doesn‚Äôt talk, so I like that she just mumbles and laughs. So glad they didn‚Äôt give her a dumb voice like Carl.
---
One time my friend was in a escape room with me and one of the clues showed a ukulele but it had the wrong amount of strings and he kept saying that it's not a ukulele and it's not a guitar (we didnt finish in time btw had one more thing to do) thx for reading
---
Good
---
Welp, your thought. For me, I prefer posting it.
---
Sadly no
---
Baddies will throw several hundred at anything to try to get an edge...
---
Thats not even that bad wdym
---
Check out her second star power
---
sad hours
---
lol tru I got on my phone right after and noticed
---
sry for taking your precious time redactor
---
Amen brother
---
First, also what happened to sector?
---
Mythic
---
L
---
AC has like a brawl stars old Tap2move styled control lol
---
That‚Äôs true too. I would‚Äôve been fine with this too.
---
Good times
---
Mortis skin also moves too
---
Pixelcrux?
---
no you can actually just drag your finger to move too
---
F=fail?
---
Luna sounds good, i was think since it's a third eye maybe Eye of Horus but we don't know if she has a both of her actual eyes so yeah Eye of Horus, Luna, or just Horus
---
It's a club btw
---
Yep sorry I only just saw it, thanks for confirming it :)
---
Mythic tbh only because it‚Äôs guaranteed new content the boxes will be like chancing it for stuff you‚Äôll naturally get over time. Plus another mythic will come soon with time.
---
Ik i said "like" 
---
Its kind of Similar
---
He left
---
Come to think of it, I've changed the flair.
---
Because it would be meme
---
Ohhhh...
---
Okay now that makes a lotta sense now...
---
#BIBI HIDE
---
It's her new star power. When she falls under 40% hp, she'll recover back to full hp under a 20 second cooldown.
---
It's kool
---
If I already have a brawler at 500 let‚Äôs say at 501, how many star points will I get
---
ohh i see
---
At 29 trophies there is barely anyone playing games except for showdown for new brawler. This is because the game doesn't get any new players. So unless you want matchmaking to take forever, it has to be like that
---
Yeah they only changed her eye
---
Mythic definitely. Unless you want coins or power points
---
she no longer has her bowing loosing animation tho
---
Gave me  2k...
---
I think her slow will help offensively, and her heal will help on defense.
---
Perfect idea it almost  works to well
---
true. But I still think it could go up form 150 to 1500 to make it more rewarding.
---
Thank you :)
---
Yeah nos i can buy meca bo or robo mike
---
Ikr
---
Carl skin has a beard not black face.
---
Good job man
---
Nice
---
Grats fam,your map is pretty good :)
---
But...but he's so cute
---
https://twitter.com/BrawlStars/status/1143990892778467329?s=19
---
Lol pretty much
---
Just play a different brawler until the ticks die down in sd.
---
Stop it I'm hungry
---
The only 2 characters i need u get
---
Lol 9th
---
For buckshot barrage shelly's super range is increased by 30% 
---
For sticky bubble gum enemies are slowed for 3 seconds
---
Also there are a couple other third star powers for brawlers which leads me to believe that they aren't unused and instead are going to be added in the coming days
---
Poco:
---
Musical Cleanse: poco's attacks remove debuffs
---
Mortis:
---
Just Too Fast: when dashing damage taken is reduced by 30%
---
Bull:
---
Tenacious B: Bull is immune to all knockback, slows, and stuns
---
Now we should talk about Leon's voice acting
---
 how to untilt pls help me
---
How???
---
Yeah he is it wasn't there altogether
---
Text
---
Dad is my name, drinking is my game*
---
Lucky me, I unlocked Mortis 2 days ago.
---
Until supercell gets enough pride in this product to have their own system for recieving reports instead of relying on a 3rd party system(reddit) they'll continue to not give a shit.
---
They have their own ways, most of them dont like to share the models
---
Ghhh, I'm mad, the model itself is alright, but the eye and the colors just take away that mystical atmosphere that made her character special
---
we all love tara
---
5.5k
---
Takes 1 year to defeat her
---
for me i love the voice but she kinda sounds like a guy
---
Oh your right I didn't even realize those.
---
It becomes much easier to grind star tokens once you have brawlers with over 500 trophies
---
15K
---
You'll receive them within 24 hours.
---
I like the remodel, but her voice seems a bit off, that I really can‚Äôt hear shit about what she is saying....(maybe they should increase the volume a bit?)
---
Maybe Supercell will make it so that that specific star power won‚Äôt be able to be used
---
0
---
Spike doesn't need a voice
---
Eae meu chapa
---
How did u buy it..it costed 50K points??
---
Thanks, man. I appreciate it greatly.
---
5k
---
Not anymore
---
How many trophies do you have?
---
Known issue. You should receive them within 24 hours.
---
Carl was used as an example of another brawler whose stats changing changed the whole tier that the brawler is is
---
she loves big guns!
---
Dang
---
This was my favorite map in bounty
---
She is definitely quiet. But imma just say this now, she doesn‚Äôt saying anything at all. No words. Nothing. All she does is mumble in different tones of voice. 
---
~~mMmmHmmHHHmHhmh~~
---
Yeah, I was getting 1st and 2nd every game tho.  So it might feel overtuned until others get theirs in Solo Showdown, but I'm not going to complain.  I find her very fun now.  Felt really good in Gems, too.  But I overall definitely agree with your stance.
---
Broken
---
Mortis is the great equalizer.
---
Not only this, but matchmaking is taking 3 to 5 times as long to get a match going.
---
They make it difficult to screen record players doing this too. This was gameplay under 400 trophies so it wasn‚Äôt a replay. I had to join his club and got lucky that he was throwing games for other players (ironic) so I could spectate him live and record him throwing. This player deserves a permanent ban because along with my game I watched him throw 3 games after that.
---
Im personally not a fan at all,  his attacks are easy to avoid. He's very weak,  he's not even fast...
---
I'd like him much more if his attacks grouped tighter,  or exploded immediately.
---
I fight for your grandpa!  \*burp\*
---
Holy crap this is awesome!
---
I farmed 300 trophies today but I couldn't get it
---
1.7k
---
How much did it cost? I got 15K points lmao
---
Honestly that's true
---
No its always available
---
It does. 
---
A lot.
---
Movement speed makes it so that you can use tracking to your advantage easily (strafing in the same direction the target is moving to hit more shots), allows you to dodge, allows you to reach objectives faster, allows you to close the distance on enemies, allows you to get away from enemies 
---
The speed of the attack (from what I read in the original post) will make it so that it's just flat out easier to hit shots. And that on colt is huge.
---
If you have 12 power gems you actually regenerate (albeit super slowly) in the storm. So in the offhand chance that you collect that many gems, yes. He can survive indefinitely
---
Yeah poor man's rockstar colt
---
To me, she kinda looks like she could be a relative to Shelly. It may be the purple hair, IDK.
---
Yeah I opened the 8000 trophy mega as well after pushing the last 100 trophy with tick. Guess what I got : nothing.
---
r/TIHI
---
I got rockstar colt though, I just like this one more
---
Don‚Äôt use tick or any other low trophy brawlers.
---
One game (Brawl Stars) is actually relevant and the other game is irrelevant (Skylanders )
---
It‚Äôs a bug, they know about it and are fixing it
---
I assume he has 6000+ at the very least considering he got a star power from the box.
---
the gas damages you every second, and tick's ability shortens the time needed to heal to one second. its like healing mushroom but you do die after a bit
---
Yeah the eye was the thing I don't like the most the thing is that her voice fits more with her old model than her new one
---
4100
---
That Carl one looks impressive
---
Excuse me! What does it mean by 'I designed it'??
---
r/almostafacereveal
---
They're located in the shop now. However, it's only a few skins available and they will rotate every day.
---
Ah okey, thanks for the fast response!
---
Yeah supercell atleast did something for broke people like us:D
---
She talks like that because of the wraps aeound her mouth try to talk clearly with that on your face
---
My player tag is #Q8VUYPP and the name is "Harry" all my brawlers are clearly 500 except for Tick,the new brawler
---
Actually I am only 3.6k trophies and I focused all my power points into Rico
---
Here comes the meemmmeeesss
---
Yup, we broke hobos
---
Yeah unfortunately I'm still quite a decent way away from that, but they did also make it easier to get higher since I you don't lose so many trophies in the 300 and 400 range now. I really struggled to get my brawlers out of the 300-450 range
---
Mortis's starpower is just a rework to his kit
---
You act like every bug can be fixed easily.
---
Discount piper super all over the field
---
If they'd change the trophy system to where it's individual based not team based, that would help.  
---
Any shit player can routinely be carried by 2 good players.  Any good player can be brought down by baddies. 
---
Base exp on kills per battle,  assists,  etc.
---
Hog rider Carl
---
Video?
---
Just rankup tick and you'll get enough to buy it
---
Yeah it is much easier to push trophies now which is good
---
Yeah it does remind me of Poco and Mortis in the gas
---
I was contemplating spending gems on it, which would have been a waste of gems of course. Cpuld have gotten it any time.
---
Luckily I made 6k trophies and it was in the mega box. It's not as good as the 1st but it's fun and nice to have the option
---
Imagine claiming you have the worst luck when you are only at 3.6 k -\_- Some people don't even have a legendary at 10 k.
---
Mechanical mr. Hankey
---
You think kairos is cringy? You should watch coach cory.
---
Quiero informar un error de la actualizacion.
---
No recibi ningun premio de la actualizacion y siendo que todos mis amigos que son mas bajo nivel que yo y si recibieron el premio de los puntos estelares.
---
I got it out of a regular box
---
Great idea
---
Oh shit,  I thought you got BOTH  star powers when unlocked.  That sucks.
---
Name it now!
---
It's a bug. You'll receive your points with 1-2 days.
---
Tbhhh
---
Sector‚Äôs successor
---
ITS TEAMING TIME BOIIIISSS!!!
---
Can we have brawler skins with at least 1 discount everyday? Wanted to spend on desired skins on certain  brawlers, but can‚Äôt do so anymore :(
---
ON GOD THOOOOO
---
I play on my phone,  it's got a great processor,  but it's kinda small and I have big hands... thought about getting a pad to play on. 
---
Im jealous of that screen tho
---
You think Tara would sound like a ghost? Plus her eye moves and shows emotion. Her mouth is covered by paper or something
---
How the fuck do you already have his star power in a day
---
Yeah i know
---
English please
---
This post didn't age well lol
---
You see how you made a well thought argument there? That‚Äôs more respectable than ‚Äúcan they just hit fix the mushrooms already?‚Äù
---
They didn't pulled out a bo and i like that
---
I hate Island Invasion but love Cavern Churn
---
Teaming ftw
---
How do you even get it I have 0
---
Woooow
---
You are amazing
---
*
---
I just fought with one wearing this costume earlier
---
We should have at least a discounted price like previously.
---
Island invasion was the best map RIP
---
Epic ending
---
I have 10k rn
---
True asf
---
Nooo Passage is the best SD map why did it have to go:(
---
No
---
You have done well my good sir
---
I do
---
I‚Äôm gonna pretend I didn‚Äôt see that
---
"One of the"
---
And also im talking about MOBAs here and most MOBAs are extremely freemium
---
I was annoyed and in a huff. My subsequent replies were just because I enjoy trolling
---
Supercell listened to us and remodeled tara and gave her a voiceline
---
o! thx for telling me
---
Yes I agree with you. Now I can‚Äôt even buy the skins I wanted. Have to wait again for refresh everyday.
---
Ok thanks so much!
---
That‚Äôs fine, but when you have time I‚Äôd like to see it. Thanks
---
Light Mecha Bo &gt; Golden Mecha Bo
---
Night Mecha Crow &gt; Golden Mecha Bo
---
In my opinion, the 10k skins are better than the 50k
---
Omg please
---
Cool to find old friends on reddit
---
You forgot something, the second to last special off should also have 50 gems
---
that explain everything i was confused because i remember "its there why isn't its there anymore?"
---
Oh good I thought I was tripping when they weren‚Äôt working at all in game
---
I was hoping for more of a New York or Brooklyn accent
---
Yes I checked thank u!
---
Same
---
To call this game a MOBA is rather absurd
---
Yeah for like a sec. If he gets close then tick is gone. Only his super can save him. It goes to him in invisible.
---
Omg lol YES
---
I guess I didn't pay much attention at the class. But when you say that it doesn't count, your username is xXGhostrider163Xx... Go back to school you little punk...
---
Haha mijn toetsenbord is gwn helemaal kierewiet als ik Engels typüòÅ
---
Spike is thickest his whole back is his butt
---
Yes officer, over here.

Oh,  duh... I don't see what they'd ban him for tho.

Bruh! Your June had 36 days?!

I miss papa franku :,(

And darryl
---
DANGER!!!! FURRY ALERT!!!1!! &gt;:(
---
TOCK TICK INHALE MY-
---
already slow progression was slowed a bit more. it's not a big deal. but now you get cool skins. getting tokens after seasons get repetitive and boring. players will be looking forward to getting new skins now.
---
NAnI??
---
(i died to 4 teaming Ticks) i was standing out of the middle, waiting for the poison to go kill the Ticks , but i didn't know this glitch was existing
---
*exploding tick sounds*
---
Me
---
It's random
---
I am proud of you
---
Everyone over 4K: This is an awesome update?
---
How is this even a valid reply to the bug report... lol sure, let‚Äôs not fix it then.
---
Perfetto, quindi tutto quello che c'√® da fare √® aspettare... Sperando che lo sistemino in fretta
---
(Perfect, so all to do is to wait... Hoping they'll fix it quickly) (I'm translating in english in case it is required to write in english)
---
Im predicting a massive nerf
---
This is Leon
---
He spins whenever he kills someone
---
Leon is dumb, don't be like Leon

Damn 7 years is coming up üòßüòßüòß
---
u/Ryan_Supercell
---
Lmao
---
You used your luck of 100 years
---
I act like everyone misunderstood my meme.
---
In Star Wars Anakin asks about this power a SITH had, and Palpatine replies that JEDI cannot teach you this.
---
So here this guy has a power of lvl 1 brawlers and then this guy asks if it's possible to learn it and I say not from a p2w player because it's an opposite of that guy with lvl 1 brawlers.
---
He is the Sith and p2w are Jedi, and my meme makes perfect sense.
---
STOP
---
I ran right into the goal as Frank lol
---
Nice find
---
Yeeeaaa one of my fav bounty maps
---
I'd definitely get this. Do you know if it'll cost Star Points?
---
Im in
---
In one of the most early trailers for brawl stars 2 years ago spike was speaking in a low pitch voice
---
Cmon man this is just a simple bug matchmaking is a super hard thing to fix cut the team some slack
---
My God, I‚Äôm an idiot! I had no idea bibi got a voice!
---
;)
---
Shoot the head
---
Well thats scary...
---
Is this the new Shelly buff?
---
This star ower is op
---
**MYTICK**
---
It's really good. Could you please delete the first comment i don't want that others click on it and see my ugly drawings.
---
On top of that, he‚Äôs more f2p friendly as well, which I feel is way better. Only have 6500 star points and one Brawler at 500 but I‚Äôm still saving up for it
---
Haha From this Mega Box I got Piper and spike now Tick (best box ever)
---
I would have agreed with this change until you factor in that the new star powers are gonna cost a total of 54,000 coins (2000 per star power x 27 star powers) and I‚Äôd say the vast majority of players at this point in the game don‚Äôt have that many coins. Star points are nice but they don‚Äôt really progress your account as a whole to becoming maxed and I think if they just buffed the coin amount it‚Äôd be really useful.
---
Sorry for the poor quality everyone :/ just showcasing the exploit tho
---
I said *some*. And even if I said all, having game breaking star powers makes it unfair to F2P players.
---
That would be broken, 3240 damage is serious and will one shot almost half of all brawlers, and it doesn't fit the name "sponge"
---
Was there 1 dynamite and 2 ticks in bounty?
---
Yeah, me too.
---
I love Bibi‚Äôs voice!
---
No, but I can somewhat draw the style.
---
Yeah i have no brawler on rank 20, but thanks to rank 15 i go 5600 points
---
Well it looks really good...
---
And tara is posseded by a demon
---
That is a very op power
---
Supercell hears you.
---
Almost 3 months later it's still doing this.
---
Damn. I want him to wear rabbit head next
---
Get those sweet Star Coins.
---
High Amount of power cubes + Star power =
---
Where have you been today?
---
Pretty much. I explained it in the description of the video
---
Literally no one since the buff
---
Wdym?
---
Sound = Off
---
Problem = Solved
---
Its been like that the WHOLE Day
---
Tick super is tick
---
But tick bombs have a face and we can call then john
---
Exactly
---
Thanks for your art post! If you are not the creator of this work, please make sure that you have included the source, or to  comment it here! Unsourced art may be removed if you are not the creator.
---
What's the voice acting then?
---
Will it change?
---
Looks EBIC
---
Oh,I saw the same team in gemgrab
---
Oh,okay,thats sad
---
Eh I can understand why people don‚Äôt like the remodel: It‚Äôs too bright. Tara‚Äôs older model had a good mixture of purple and magenta, giving her a bolder look. The remodel seems to be too bright and less pleasing to the eye.
---
Mixed them up?
---
Well, I hope I'll get used to her voice since I use Tara a lot, but I personally would've preferred if they made her say actual words or smthg
---
I saw a BiBi
---
they forgot to set the models eyes and mouth to not animate
---
The game doesn‚Äôt want you to play with other Ticks to have a chance at a better team balance so it so it takes time to pair you with some own different thats why solo sd is lightning fast it just pairs you with anyone
---
Shut and spam them onto shelly she op. Not really she üí©
---
I‚Äôm just taking a break from the game. 
---
Waiting for the inevitable update bug fixes, and a Tick balance. 
---
I‚Äôm used to this from playing Clash Royale for years.
---
Shelly star power is completely shit
---
That was 6th. 5th was used to be -1
---
Yes
---
seems like they are trying to seem nice when they're actually fucking us over. I mean I have many brawlers at 500 but removing the tokens from season end is really annoying. Specially for a new currency that buys only COSMETICS I don't want that shit
---
No woery mate,it will go to the right place,it may be a glitch that you got an extra 500 that got deducted maybe
---
You can.. but it takes some time
---
The springtraps are unbalanced symmetry is key
---
(angry whooshing)!
---
This represents all servers in brawls stars right now
---
WOW
---
Shelly star power op and shit so much..
---
Rip big game
---
Yea but since there is a massive inflation of a single brawler the match making system for a diverse game is overrun and ultimately puts you with other ticks
---
nani
---
It feel it fits as she is meant to be all mystic so her voice is echoey and muffled
---
We just lost our best defender
---
you know people do this "for the meme" right? so spreading it IS the problem
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/ChargeYourPhone/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChargeYourPhone/)
---
Got 2 SP allready for coins, so nothing to worry about
---
Leon is on there... somewhere
---
(really angry sounding wooshing)
---
I love Bibi's voice
---
It's a friendly game man relax
---
Is it too much to ask uf you could send me a screen shot please?
---
tArA iS sHeLlY cOnFiRmEd!!!
---
Nah , He need a nerf . He is realy annoying and overpowered
---
Sounds really autoaim frendly because the target is literally snared to one place
---
Resta in peace I see this an absolutly win meme
---
Yeah but the only other option would be to pair you with players with higher trophies and that would lead to odd skill gaps
---
the bug with the mushrooms happend to me too+cool remodel with Tara finally!you'r working so hard for good reasolts(sorry for my englesh) and the game it's cool,keep on working.
---
Hold up, how would you send it?
---
how this timing is so perfect
---
Buy it if you want but id save for that dynamike/spike
---
you may never know if she is actually a trap 
---
^alright imma go before r/shellygang will super me into space
---
I'm not crying, i just wanted to let the team now about the situation. Btw, some of my clubmember did NOT get the same skin, so your theory is not completely true.
---
and what about 700 trophies? what they changed exactly in gains and loses of trophies? and how was before update¬ø
---
Barley and Tick are very good lads
---
thanks for ruining my day
---
Both skins r with 150 gems .. watch the brawl talk Frank says it
---
Imma go with a week cuz by then most of the Tick users should already be way up there
---
This was THE BEST update so far. Thank you Supercell.üòÅ
---
Just wait a couple of days and it will be ok. Tha same was with Rosa and Bibi release. Everyone want to play new brawler
---
But the totem dosen'r give you full life
---
Congrats bro loved it the moment I saw  it  in Rey's contest...it's kinda unique
---
Same thing happened to me earlier. Same rewards, nothing.
---
well thats my job as rico
---
Indeed, also he is too simple for a mythic
---
Yeah but I think this will just happen with boxes, I have 4 brawlers max rn, and indeed don't have the coins to buy star powers, but I would only buy them if I have all my brawlers maxed, otherwise I would save them for my next upgrade. I just wait until I get the Star Powers out of boxes
---
We need giant as a skin for a tank brawler
---
Very cool update, Thanks!
---
I feel you. Did the same yesterday but i didn‚Äôt even get bonuses.. the luck is real haha
---
Bad bibi
---
Wait wat
---
oh god
---
Star powers don‚Äôt affect matchmaking
---
#NOT ON MY CHRISTIAN REDDIT SERVER
---
His dmg is fine as is (if anything it's a bit weak), but he needs a "bar nerf"
---
To the point where he has 1 or 2 ammo bars like carl  that way he cant pepper the entire map.
---
Lol i‚Äôm about to hit 8000 and i‚Äôm wondering if i can get something important. I‚Äôm still missing Mortis, Crow and Leon
---
Stop this!! We got it!! Stop reposting exactly one thing over and over for karma! This is the third time I am seeing the same post. And where the fuck are the mods? Why aren't they deleting these posts that are actually "repetitive". Instead, one of deleted my post saying it was repetitive.
---
Sharp shooters:no dont.        Throwers:yes
---
I mean, what were the people expecting, the mask covers her mouth
---
D-Day
---
This is a genocide!!
---
I like the way he can counter mortis though, it's funny as I watch the retarded mortis running away from my super.
---
Mortis cant do shit against it. And the mine field repels them.
---
Are the Mecha skins for a limited time or will they stay in circulation in the shop? Because it‚Äôs going to take me a few weeks to get the gold ones. I‚Äôm earning 16k star points each reset.
---
Ohhhhhh i get it
---
Give it a week and all the top players will have pushed Tick. This happens with every new brawler, it just takes a bit of time to settle back down
---
Gold mecha crow is better
---
Well... I was afraid that I would lose a lot of trophies, but with the new Siege... I would try him.
---
Also jessie
---
I get that but at the moment the loss of 106 makes me really mad, because the spam that Tick is capable of is really big.
---
Tbh her super is way to fast to load
---
Nobody cares
---
I liked long siege. I could push really high trophies there and always looked at it like a great end game event.
---
Primos star power is so much greater than his old one, which is garbage
---
now he can actually get close when he knocks them away
---
Ok. üëç
---
That Pam cant even put the super down to fight with Leon lol
---
Perfection
---
2017 !
---
true
---
Thats fake man .. spikes background is blue that should be yellow
---
Tick counters mortis lmfao.
---
Mortis: oh a low health thrower üòè
---
*goes towards tick*
---
Tick: *supers*
---
Mortis: üò±
---
Nah the best value is power points when they‚Äôre on sale. And you get to directly level up the champ you want
---
Are you still accepting applicants?
---
oh yes!
---
he means for the brawlers he already has
---
Fucking hell, bro what god did u pray to?
---
Yes, but they were at 4500 trophies and i had 3250..
---
Jesus, fucking chill out
---
But why the heel could they stay adding brawlers that counters mortis insatead of buffing him
---
Wrong subreddit
---
What about Bunny Penny Losing Pose?
---
Brock just doesn‚Äôt feel like he deserved the star player
---
Saness
---
It happened, they murdered our silent beauty! ;(
---
New Leon Remodel is good
---
When I click on it, it just shows which one is equipped

True:)

There is one more bug now we won't get tokens from season end rewards please fix that üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Guys there was an update
---
Just Monika
---
Welp... That's hiw friendship ends:/
---
‚ÄúI see this as an absolute win!‚Äù
---
Okay, Reword that so people understand it. 2 contact support threw the game.
---
#HOOOGGGG RIDAAAAHHHH
---
I wish that Supercell would do Avatars for Skins too like you did on the top left corner!
---
This would be cool
---
It‚Äôs the actual sp
---
sooo true XD
---
r/TickGang so are we teaming up with r/MortisGang now?
---
I like this! Well done!

Rodaspipagetirikthicc
---
Me too
---
This must happen to me 2 I guess...
---
old
---
And im just glad they didnt ruin her like rico...poor rico, I mean he looks fine in menu, but he looks sad and fat in game ‚òπ, the only time whne he looks goof is with skins, but the deafilt rico skin is a disaster in my opinion...F for rico üò≠
---
But why is it 2500 star points.
---
Oh sorry i meant freak
---
It's not really a tail:/ 
---
Bombs always have that little string what you use to blow them so his body is a bomb...
---
My latest post is about tara's voice and I it's pretty accurate
---
#The Start of the Nuclear War (1875 Colorized)
---
Why you didn‚Äôt mention it in update? It is unfair to the new player.
---
Im sitting around 10.2k and my mega box was pure dirt
---
It's looks impressive
---
Yeah she also looks a lot more girly in that pose (if you know what I mean) also they should change the picture of tara's flair on this sub now
---
And what about darryl? I know one line. When he dies: *sad beeps* lol
---
What did you use to decrypt?
---
He even says "Hey! You broke my quitar."
---
Who is that red guy
---
The form is still open, yes
---
I thought he would‚Äôve died as an antivaxx kid. But instead he is just retarded.
---
He should get a voice similar to rico and barley, since he is a robot
---
But do u only get star points on the trophies u lost? They don't reward extra star points for your total trophy count if u have 500 trophies brawler?
---
matchmaking, ladies and gentlemen!
---
But you'll one get them if you have a brawler above 500 trophies.
---
When i heard her voice i grapoed the bible and screamed "BEGONE DEMON!"
---
I might've gotten the recent rank up rewards, which recent my all rank up star coin rewards. I've contacted but idk if I will get them back
---
I think ‚úÖ ‚Äòs head skip mortis‚Äôs attack
---
I AM SPEEED
---
*hugs turret*
---
10K
---
When u realize it‚Äôs going for a bush camper
---
CYKA BLYAT
---
They are global players, not beta players. If you are over 10k you should have at least one star power anyway.
---
They have a higher chance than you. You not getting anything isn‚Äôt bad luck, it‚Äôs called being selfish and thinking that you‚Äôve had a hard time, while other have had a lot worse.
---
This is the same gif used for spike runnig from bo traps
---
Sorry by same color I meant dull colors like brown white black but just my opinion obviously
---
Firstly not getting Pam from the Big Box, then this! OMG, my day is ruined! ( tho I have 0.0288 chance at leggies and 0.5 at Pam, soo...)
---
Well she doesn‚Äôt have a mouth after all
---
Once you start leveling him up, his damage is a lot. Being able to hit someone 3 times for over 800 damage is no small number. Plus, his head, if used right, is basically guaranteed damage.
---
based on past evidence that jessie/nita/tara's minion got scaled up and they are OP as diarrhea and supercell fixed it that the stats no longer upscale/lower upscale as the boss.
---
More like Tick is the one
---
Lol
---
Waaaay back when, in the beta days of Brawl Stars, Bo used to be an epic. Then he was a super rare (other waya round maybe?) And then he became a trophy road award.
---
I mean the new Star Power for Bull is that he reduces damage taken by 30% when he is below 40% and I think it has no CD
---
I love thst skin but i dont have crowüò≠
---
But gene‚Äôs voice came before Carl was even announced :P
---
Barley is the hardest one to kill in my opinion
---
Tick's super is a really good counter to Tick
---
I don't think they intended that but would be cool if they kept it that way.
---
How did you even confirm that he‚Äôs tick
---
Yep you are right he can one shot him close range
---
Chill
---
I will not sleep tonight
---
Keep in mind the original skin already costs 5 bucks so I think it‚Äôs fair
---
With that face i can't take him seriously.
---
A slight range, damage, and duration that the mines last nerf would balance him really well, 1 rule less range so he can‚Äôt snipe people across the map as well, slight damage nerf so he doesn‚Äôt melt through everyone, and slight duration of how long they‚Äôre on the ground for nerf because right now, if you corner someone it‚Äôs basically impossible to get out because you just pile more mines into the space where they are and unless you can walk around them, it‚Äôs impossible to dodge them
---
Play footage of hurricane
---
You only get power points from ranking up to rank 10, 15, and 20.
---
Oof
---
Cough cough duels cough
---
Imposter
---
same. I think it looks okay but they could have done a better job.
---
we need this.... like srsly
---
I was talking about top players. The very top players, if they stay consistently up there, should be able to get it in 3-4 months. A more casual player with less than 15k is going to take close to 8 months. Maybe more, depending on how many they get per season.
---
I agree with the range, and the duration of the mines should be nerfed from 3 sec to 2.
---
However I dont believe he needs a dmg nerf.
---
I think dynamike should have a little bit more range on barley so barley wont be the dominant thrower anymore.
---
i love her voice. it suits her well.
---
Okay first we saw mythic starpower
---
then mythic starpoints ordering
---
then this????
---
THIS IS ENOUGH!!!
---
Mine is loading, but you are not the single one who has this problem
---
Now Mortis won't be that bad.Because of Tick throwers will be more common in heist.Nad you know what that means.....
---
This is cool
---
Well if you take out all the letters and then add like 6 more you get mythic
---
I did this and no one responds!
---
she heals 5040 health and healing is reduced for the boss too
---
‚ÄúBare witness to my thiccness!‚Äù
---
Well done! I have seen many of your posts on r/brawlmaps and have liked many of your creations and it is great to see you have one implemented into the game.
---
This map sucked!
---
Tick is really good

Those skins are so freaking bad ass.

I really like them

I know right

The more I watch it the less it looks like it

Me too :D
---
cavern churn: oh... you thought i was gone? üòà
---
I want that skin so much but I need 1.600 more star points. That are 6 more brawlers at rank 20.
---
True that. We got a Night Witch skin. We didn't whine, we made memes out of it.
---
I don't think there's rng becos if u auto aim your attack on a box, all 3 mines will 100% hit the box.
---
Speaking as a player who WAS maxed....having several hundred boxes plus the 40k coins I already had....I‚Äôll be maxed again in no time. Most people who‚Äôve been maxed for a while will be in the same position. This is great end game content and it just gives people who aren‚Äôt there even more reason to keep playing the game.
---
Not me.  They new one is much more polished and fits the Brawl Stars theme a lot better.  And also you‚Äôre Karma farming.
---
*did whine and they reduced the price, therefore when the next skin came out everyone said that skin was bad in hope of a discount 
---
FTFY
---
Bo fucked mortar and tick appeared
---
Spotted the pros
---
I don't like the idea of trophy grinding.  Any shit player can be carried by 2 good players.  
---
I wish they'd give star points based on something more tangible,  like kills.  Every kill= 1 star point,  maybe not 1, but something like that.  
---
As of now,  this game other than solo showdown really doesn't reward individual accomplishments.  I feel like if I'm on a losing team yet outplay any enemy individually,  I should still get something.  If it's a draw,  there's still a star player at least
---
At least bo has a skin now.
---
I mean he is already past that
---
26th, first time it said 300 trophies, now it changed to June 36th, oof.
---
Wtf
---
What?
---
Autocorrect
---
Well at least I didn't whine, I love that skin to troll
---
I like the voice? Idk why some people are complaining
---
Man i didn't heal while in the mushrooms and then i died
---
Gene:
---
Where is the bug?

I got 4,900 since I got him to rank 20

Are you complaining about free skins...
---
Copy of my post (Repost)
---
Not going to be easy to pull off in real match tbh
---
The Earth has just lost her best defender
---
Yes that's how it will be. The only way to get star points before pushing above 500 is getting brawlers to rank 10, 15, and 20
---
Everytime there's a new brawler with low rarity
---
My umbrella is there too!
---
Is it still +5 on a win
---
You might be one of the few who didn‚Äôt drop their pants to join the ‚ÄúREEE EW UGLY MUNSTER MORT‚Äù circle jerk, that gladly was fast to die out
---
HIM
---
Dude there are so many people that will benefit from this that aren't top 200 global
---
I can‚Äôt even play, it‚Äôs only 2 players me and the other player. It doesn‚Äôt matter how many times I tried I still can‚Äôt play with Tick. Matchmaking is the bug!
---
please help me understand the logic behind throwing games, i just dont get it
---
If there are no proofs, you are just a liar
---
Let those Carl ult in peace
---
I guess you're right
---
i got it, he shoots electricity out of his arm 10/10
---
Yeah it‚Äôs cool but getting a brawler on rank 20 don‚Äôt feel that good as before. It‚Äôs too easy ...
---
Oh, I totally agree.  I'm basically in the same boat as you (about 30k coins and 200 boxes saved), and this is a great way to spend all of that down.  It's a boon for Supercell - but I didn't mean that in a bad way.  It's actually a good thing - the better this game does and the more money Supercell makes from it the more time and resources they can put into making it better.  
---
I'm a beta player, so I remember all the fears I had back during beta that the game wasn't sustainable because it was too easy to max and therefore wouldn't make Supercell enough money.
---
They should just triple the coins given in each brawl box
---
I think so. It is at least higher than 3
---
This is an accurate representation of what we will soon be seeing in showdown
---
It's not because of the new update. I've had this issue (with Frank too) earlier this week too before the update was released. It's incredibly annoying, but it's simply a delayed attack bug, it happens sometimes. Just wait for a bit and try playing later, for me it's been solved just like that every time.
---
What if it was brock...?
---
What brawlers have you not yet unlocked?
---
And it isn't a bug... That is just what happens when there are no enough players in your matchmaking poool due to them playing probably Solo SD.
---
It may not work as normally, but it isn't a bug because you can't "fix" it. Is just gow the matchmaking works
---
Tip : Only team to kill teamers and then go away and play normally
---
CarDs In YoUr FacE!
---
That is a good idea
---
How dare you oppose me mortal
---
At lower trophies, yes but at higher trophies i think its just like every other modes
---
More skins I can‚Äôt afford!
---
Anyone that have mortis can be in the gang right?
---
Showdown should be renamed Tickdown in a new a update
---
So if you have zero brawlers above 500 trophies you get 0 points?
---
or is it 500 overall trophies?
---
Lol, the value is almost equal to the legendary?? WTH
---
Eh, true I just didn‚Äôt want a reskin of colt.
---
Mi only star points if you‚Äôre over 500 trophies with a brawler
---
Your time is ticking down in tickdown
---
Why did you post the same image in one picture?
---
Didn‚Äôt even realize I did that lol
---
The music is SICK!
---
Yeah you are right too. We got atleast something tho
---
I dont know man, may be this will change the perspective of most of the players who think siege is some kinda mega tilt mode, we'll see
---
LMAO
---
Yeah but mecha bo animation isnt that great.
---
Do you know when it'll be released? Looks pretty sick to me
---
Mecha crow is amazing... electrifying darts..
---
Or you should say, *T H I C C*
---
And, for Clash Royale 4th birthday, Carl is getting a makeover, IT'S HOG RIDER CARL
---
I think I have seen this before with Night Witch Nortis XD
---
420 Blaze It
---
Then they would have to increase the amount of tokens you get per trophy lost. If the trophies above 500 are the only way to get the points can you believe how long it would take for even a pro player to get a simple linebacker bull?
---
I‚Äôve always loved this format.
---
The people who hated it before will still hate it. All they did was ruin it for the people like me who loved it and made lots of trophies playing it
---
The three cards she wields possess a sun, a cresent moon and a star icon.

I really can't tell you lmao. I played a lot but not excessively. I think I have won 95% of my games though. So that explains a little.

I can hear this picture

ok God, I decided I want to die (congrats bro)
---
Well, just as for any new bralwer release. Thats not a problem 24-48h and it'll normalize. The real problem is, as you pointed out, the trio, area bans everywhere, all melee brawlers are completely destroyed by that.
---
Spike is strong af wdym?

DO IT ASAP

It's called content.

Stop this shit
---
Forget smooth yoda, smooth spike is the real deal
---
Hahaha
---
Agree with the star points part, but the top200 part may not be the case. It's much easier to push trophies at 300-500 now, so I feel many players can reach 500+ later.
---
But at range he‚Äôs hella OP at controlling an area and keeping enemies far back. Hes not going to get 10 kills a game but he‚Äôs really useful in games like gem grab when it comes to holding enemies behind the lines.
---
6000 18 brawlers highest rarity epic and only one
---
Grats! So many people are going to climb... With 500 being the new 300,  13,500 is gonna be a lot more common. High players could potentially go above 20k
---
Yeah, my comment‚Äôs kinda outdated now
---
Why do they even have the 50000 star point skins in shop right now? It‚Äôs physically impossible for anyone to get them and you can‚Äôt buy star points with money/gems... what a waste of shop space. Both of my slots are filled with skins that cost 50000 and I only have 14000 to spend
---
being the bad guy doesnt necessarily means hes the bad guy.
---
yeah he's protecting those game throwers, but his point is valid. im in no part agree with game thrower either, yeah 4 people are happy and 2 ppl are sad. 
---
but if they were to lose in an actual game instead of game throwing, they high likely wouldnt mind at all
---
Map name checks out
---
Predatory marketing practices have a way of doing that

Yeah did you not like read the post or?

Poor guy...

If you're below 500 Trophies, you will no longer receive a Season-end reward. Sorry about that! Though it's significantly easier to get to 500 Trophies now, so you should have no trouble climbing up
---
If the season finished, and I had a 502 bow, would I get like 2 star points instead of the normal tokens, or like 500?
---
Michael scores both goals! Wow!

I found it first

"There's gunna be 15 bulls hiding in there"
---
Agreed. I use her mostly now as I do with star power Barley to dictate where opposing teams are and aren‚Äôt allowed to migrate haha. Timed right, the 4th teammate of bear makes a bottleneck push for the score in Brawlball rather flawless. And in Robo Rumble/Seige, I like to draw boss robot‚Äôs attention with full health/ammo before launching bear on robot‚Äôs bum side. It‚Äôs hilarious to see the boss robot convulse in 180 spins as it‚Äôs health just melts away like a hot knife through butter. Love.
---
Tick is great but it would be better if the speed of fall of the basic attacks was divided into two speeds according to the range of Tick and the distance: one faster than the current one when they are thrown close and another one like the current one when they are launched far.
---
Robo Dynamike launching his fists is pretty fuggin fly
---
Oh,  wow,  supercell hates you
---
So I have checked out your Youtube Channel, and I normally wouldn't necesarily like that type of thing, I don't see any harm in allowing this. Feel free to use the clip! When you do use it and upload the video with my clip, I'd like you to send me it on Reddit if that is okay. Have a nice day! :)
---
YES! He shoots bee's and his super, he shoots honeycomb! Perfect!
---
Penny be like: got you!
---
Ugh. H8 u...haha.
---
Its a nightmare
---
_Well yes, but actually no_
---
wtf is cavern hell back???
---
Same. Won 7 games in a row with just one push and the new rewards don't make it feel as special. It's way too easy. Siege was the only high risk high reward mode and it was great for pushing trophies and was also super fun imo. I still enjoy Siege but it's not as fun without the risk, the close matches, and the big trophies if you do win.
---
I always thought he had red hair
---
not interested, but thank you for asking
---
1. He's already superior
---
2. Quit auto aiming
---
Honestly sometimes I just like seeing my brawler spin really fast. And if theres a lull I just need something for my thumbs to do. Didnt realize how people felt about that til I subbed here.
---
Hello! Could I please use your clip in my Brawl Stars Highlights series? :) You would be properly credited in the video and in the description of the video. I won‚Äôt use the footage without your permission. If you‚Äôre interested, here‚Äôs our channel: [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt5A9Y-b\_TnvG6SKYpcPu3g](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt5A9Y-b_TnvG6SKYpcPu3g) . Thank you!
---
He‚Äôs high skill cap your just bad and can‚Äôt play him well ;)
---
So when are the youtubers allowed to talk about the biggest updates in the game, mid summer or end ü§îüòú ?
---
No they dont. All my peeps have almost lvl 9 power. I just never have enough coins.
---
New ting to see now old
---
Around 4100
---
It Used To Make Me Uncomfortable To See Someone Write Without Caps,But Now It Doesn't Really Bother Me And So I Got Used To It.I can write without caps.
---
Sure, take it
---
It‚Äôs back in the game
---
Ah shit...
---
Mortis has a crush on tara confirmed üòÇ
---
Not the biggest different but it looks so much better. The Tara meme can now rest in heavan with "Buff Crow". I hope Piper will get her remodel next
---
Damn it‚Äôs so annoying to read haha, but ah well to each their own. If you want to do extra work to spice up your text go for it lol
---
5500
---
13.5K
---
Lol . What is rng about it? The only 4 SP that I have are the only 4 brawler that I manage to put lvl 9. Because ther is little gold in the game I have 19 brawlers to upgrade but I lack the gold. Most of them I have PP to ugrade more than 1 power lvl. There is nothing about rng.
---
Duuuuude that sucks
---
When Tick‚Äôs head chases Bo:
---
*The spirits are calling my name...*
---
Wooooow
---
Plus it‚Äôs way easier to reach rank 20 now
---
Yup
---
Highest brawler?
---
Open boxes, earn trophies
---
6900 still no legendary tho my 5k friend has 27/27
---
I think they made that to differentiate her from gene, since previous they share almost the same colour palate
---
Siege*
---
Ahahah a I haven't got leggendaries toooo,üò≠
---
and matches last only 2m 30s
---
I Got Used To It.it actually makes it a little harder to not do caps because I am so used to it.
---
Let hope so
---
More than 3 gems?üòÇ Some more power points? Idk
---
Doesn't look buff to me or i think i dont get it oops
---
I‚Äôve just noticed it looks like a pikachu
---
Awesome. It seems that you had a good time pushing him. He is everywhere right now. I wait until the hype is gone and I can actually push him
---
I don't have any legendaries and my only mythic is Mortis
---
I have 19 and most of them I have PP enough to upgrade more them 1 power level
---
Stupid dumb peace of fuckin crap
---
Shut up teamer
---
It seems that you had a good time pushing him. I wait until ge isn't everywhere anymore
---
I just think if they‚Äôre gonna implement this system it should swing both ways
---
I'm sorry üòÇ they need to work on their system, at least slightly better rewards, I didn't get anything from the 4K and the 5K (which I opened like 4 days ago)
---
I just un subbed from r/brawlstars
---
Its white crow all over again smh

Lockwooood

But it makes her more spookier

Only 140 more for 6000!

Happens all the time to me or my phone will die and then I just pray to god my bot makes it to 5th
---
But atleast people will feel less angry after they got disconnected
---
Nice art
---
i have 3400 trophies and i have no legendaries or mythics :/
---
We already knew that, and why is the flair humour?
---
Same experience, i've had so many encounters with Ticks teaming.
---
Sometimes it‚Äôs better to shoot than body block cuz you die almost instantly and it doesn‚Äôt really make a difference than say, dealing extra damage:
---
Don‚Äôt forget that poor colt getting slaughtered in the shadows
---
Is that CR war chest? Looks cool dude, nice details
---
Night mecha crow's the best
---
Why dom?
---
you‚Äôre retarded too, buddy. everyone was complaining about how shitty it was, so they improved it. siege‚Äôs perfect rn.
---
I've actually NEVER seen ANY Dynamikes in Cavern Churn
---
Only max bo, bull, shelly, and occasional ricos
---
I usually only play My 400+ bo on there
---
How did you kill your teammates?
---
Called a crosspost much?
---
You‚Äôre getting star points as season reward for each trophy you‚Äôre losing at the of the season 600 trophies = 50 star points
---
Sure bro, thanks and I'll sure see that videoüòéüëçüèΩ
---
One punch man
---
Did you draw this
---
My Shelly heals my teammates. WTF?
---
Let's call him Tock
---
Well u are wrong. U can easily compare one game to another game it doesnt matter. i could have taken pro lol game where one team just afk in spawn while other team end the game. Its the matter of the fact that someone is throwing a game. 
---
And yes u where defending game throwing when u state that throwing actually make 4 out of 6 players happy. that is defending it. U can either contract the statement but trying to tell people u werent defending it is wrong. 
---
im out aint gonna waste more time debating wether it should be okay to game throw in any situation ever.
---
Us*
---
If in 8 months playing without stopping, they gave me 10K, according to my calculations, I could buy one of those skins in 1 year and a half if I play 24/7
---
I love the voice and vibranty colors. The remodel she got was subtle-ish but great. She used to be one of my last favorite brawlers but all of this she got makes me appreciate ger a lot more, very cool stuff. Also I really like the voice in particular cuz I think it gives a different personality. A lot of the newer voices are all very punny which I‚Äôm alright with, but this ghosty voice is more unique then what could‚Äôve happened with an actual voice.
---
3300
---
Congrats man. I got an accidental goal before too. But fr\*ck my Bo was under 400 trophies
---
All ticks: Get a super and it‚Äôs a free kill
---
Gold mech crow is 50 k
---
colored versions cost star points, the skin itself costs 300
---
He throws a cluster bomb which breaks in the air and drops three mines
---
Black mecha crow is way cooler
---
I get your question. I'm in the same boat. 8000+ trophies but no brawlers above 500 yet. And yes, that means we have no season rewards. :( For this alone I'm not feeling the update.
---
they added it back!
---
Removed. Keep your post titles descriptive and provide context. Additionally do not use low effort/all caps/clickbait titles.
---
I spent like 3 days editing this video... Time well spent?
---
Bigger? Its easier till 500...
---
Sry, IS back
---
Yesterday I played with another 5 Ticks lol
---
Everybody gangsta till the girl with Mr. Bat starts commanding
---
I hope they all get one
---
I think its cool how they‚Äôre trying to make the new SPs really good so they make the game more interesting later on, but I can see releasing them 3 per week to be slightly problematic cuz the characters that get theirs first might dominate for a little lol. Although ig that‚Äôll keep the meta this summer until our next update constantly changing which will be exciting now that I think about it.
---
haha thanks!
---
wat
---
Ironically the 10k versions are cooler than 50k
---
Leon's dad
---
el primo would be way too op on this map
---
Just a question ( if you see me) 
---
I want to make these skin concepts too, but i draw them on paper, wich doesn't look good . Wich program do you use?
---
I like blet
---
We should talk not about excel, but about all of the good maps that removed. Sneaky Fields, Stone Fort, and of course, Bot Drop. Why remove all of this maps?
---
üòç
---
Now you can get steamrolled on the first bot which is infinitely less fun
---
Well yes, but actually no
---
DOPE
---
300 for robo Mike? Hell nah
---
This proves that the theory of evolution is real
---
Feels like it isnt properly worth anymore? I mean afterall, high risk high reward, the game in itself is more intense than other modes but ohwell
---
I know I'm not doing it my friends do this sometimes when a new brawler is coming
---
It‚Äôs shorter too. Now ppl won‚Äôt delete the game because of -10. They have also made less trophy loss.
---
You don‚Äôt get double trophies anymore.
---
It‚Äôs a lot quicker now.
---
WW2
---
Yeah that's changed now
---
only humans blink
---
No it's the the shortened version of DOOM
---
It‚Äòs the exact same title and image. I checked it
---
Tickception
---
Couldn't have put it better myself
---
Gay
---
I feel like they did it to attract more "casual" players to the mode because they didn't want to play it since you lost 10.
---
My post is fine. I am just bringing to atention about doesn't receiving anything now with season reward. At least before we had the tokens now we don't get anything if you don't have brawlers at 500 trophies. And if people complain about it they might change back. You that is shitty. You keep downvoting me so I start downvoting you too..
---
Are you kidding? If you‚Äôre accurate with your shots Dynamike can deal a ton more damage, and his super will finish people off. Plus, his first star power essentially lets him escape ALL close range combat whereas barley doesn‚Äôt have anything close to that. Sure, barley has more range, but dynamices damage output counters that.
---
Yeah, i think the 10 trophy one was better
---
Yes, they made siege shorter and now u don‚Äôt gain x2 rewards, ppl were complaining about big trophy loss.
---
Oh i didn‚Äôt notice it was shorter
---
Nice, how many subs?
---
lol you are out for blood jeez
---
‚ÄúWell you‚Äôre wrong and I‚Äôm right. I know all your intentions even though I didn‚Äôt read what I was commenting on properly. Well I‚Äôm not going to waste my time debating because I know I‚Äôm right‚Äù 
---
That‚Äôs essentially what you said. I‚Äôm going to opt out here because you lack the technique of solid reasoning. I understand that you may still be young, but you shouldn‚Äôt go into a fight against a sword with a wooden stick, run out of the swords reach, and then declare yourself the victor. That‚Äôs called acting ridiculous. Well, bye now.
---
i love this skin.. VOTE:10 IT'S SO SO SO SO SO SO SO SO COOOOOOL
---
Suck it up and keep opening free boxes or pay to get Mega Boxes. I‚Äôm not even sure what you‚Äôre asking but from what I could gather, Supercell won‚Äôt give you a free legendary
---
Oh ok. Have a good day
---
Not many at all. I didn‚Äôt mean it as a self promotion - that‚Äôs just my name
---
Great job!
---
rip u got last
---
It‚Äôs not confirmed he is the dad though
---
It's probably to celebrate the 7 years anniversary of Clash Of Clans.
---
No,  you get 100 star points for every rank up you do, so that "bonus" is just all the rank up you did before.
---
I got spike and 12 gems from a big box at 4500 trophies
---
maybe it‚Äôs just me but i hate her new skin

Not officialy but based on what i've seen i think you can buy the skin for free (only the colour disponible) so that's pretty cool.
---
I love being supportive and throwing Tick's head to counter another Tick head and protect a near death teammate
---
Nah I'm talking about the datamine and the video

Carl was shown breaking walls. Whoch isnt in his current starpower

Ik what they are doing but I think thier hiding a 3rd batch for later on.

Omg so cool!
---
In the video they said that all the original Robo skins are 150 gems
---
I need mecha bo
---
But now people with 0 brawlers above 500 will get nothing. I dont have a single one in that situation and this update hurts that kind of players. They think everyone should make it to 500 easily but that's not true.
---
Bo &amp;crow = mecha buddies
---

It is just a common answer of Support.

"It works like this, and we don't care and we don't know about what happens in the future!!!"

I know, but it's an interesting theory.

There needs to be a way to report these people
---
I wish i could do this to randoms...
---
Too many people trying to play tick. Brawl stars matchmaking matches people with different brawlers.
---
Should be red if you ask me
---
No one
---
Totally agree, also the battles used to be very intense and now they are cut short bc of the duration of rounds.
---
Thank you!

I second that

I used vto hate siege because it wasn't worth the risk now I hate it because it isn't fun

Star points aka high amount of trophies

Rip everyone.

I am not trying to insult you. If you need to use bad words to prove something or to make your statement look stronger then it is either your IQ or your age. I really hope its second one. And also voting down my comments still proves my point. I just need someone more mature to comment about this in a normal way. Will say bye to you and all the best.

they could just play in solo showdown ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

We already got Well Oiled tho
---
I mean, no.

Not only did they remove the one thing that motivated 1000+ players to push further (double rewards in siege), but also, it means that getting to 500 is worthless. YOU are right that it's easier to push to 500, but that's not a good thing. It just means that it devalues the Rank 20 mark, massively. Combine that with the worse pushing opportunities for higher players, and you end up with a much more dense trophy distribution amongst players. Definitely, definitely not a good thing.
---
The post doesn‚Äôt say anything about my question, so I have no idea what you are saying
---
They usually bring back "classics" maps every update
---
Yeah I miss the high stakes
---
lol, this aint that bad, i mean yes this √æa√∞ is aids but 50 trophys? Jesus christ it just sounds like you where playing someone like piper or smt like that
---
Numbers tell you how many mines are touching that square
---
Right click to put flag where you think a mine might be
---
Click every other square
---
No because every trophy over 500 counts 2 now it didn't before so youll get a boost from that
---
Her star power.

Got tick to power level 5 after saving up brawl boxes for the update. He becomes a bit overpowered in gem grab after powerlevel 4

That‚Äôs why I said they need reworks. And I dislike them

Too. I have an idea to balance them

Both of you want to read it. It‚Äôs on this post:

I swear brock was common. Or did they change him to rare? I forgot
---
Jesus christ siege is Fkfest now... so stupid with some picks...
---
You should get them after a lot of playing, they won‚Äôt lower the price so everyone could buy them, because then what‚Äôs the point?
---

Found [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/c66x8f/cool_friendly_match_glitch_where_you_can_kill/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app) post in my home page and that‚Äôs how I did it

Why didnt it happen to me! When tick got released i had 4125 throphies?
---
I love this map I got 50 trophies in 30 minutes on this map

My opinikn about this changes:

Bo: good

Penny: good

Piper:good

Spike: very good

Crow: meh...

Click the post and find the changes really think about them

For me this update killed a lot of the fun.
---
1- Siege had its flaws, but I found it OK. Now it's crap, whoever attacks first wins the match, it's totally focused on the first 30s kills
---
2- Tick sucks: too long range and too good auto aim, unclear blast radius, new brawler hysteria
---
3- Hated Sunstroke, especially filled with ticks
---
I hope these things get fixed soon.. /:
---
I think Supercell might have done this intentionally so it isn't crazy op in big game or showdown.
---
What's the problem here? You guys willingly went with a lower brawler, it goes based off off highest, not average...
---
Huh?
---
If a square has a number on it, that number of bombs is around that square(including diagonally)
---
Underrated

That‚Äôs what happens when you play Rick and they don‚Äôt want duplicate ticks on your team

Don't forget Bo :')

Thats why they should fix that

My memory is a bit bad but Minesweeper works roughly like this:
---
#Objective of the game
---
The objective of the game is to find all tiles that does not have a mine in it. Mines are placed on random tiles and your job is to not explode. All tiles are hidden at the beginning of the game. Since all tiles are hidden at the beginning of the game, it is possible to lose on your first click.
---
#How do I play?
---
Clicking on any tile will reveal it, revealing a blank tile, a numbered tile, or a mine. If you reveal a blank tile, it will reveal the tiles around it, continuing until it reveals a tile(s) with a number on it (at least it does this in the version I played). 
---
Right clicking (at least in my version) marks the tile with a flag. This is usually used to help you remember which tiles you think is a mine. It does not actually do anything though.
---
#The numbers, Mason! What do they mean?!
---
A tile with a number on it tells you how many mines is in the tiles next to it, either directly next to it or diagonally from it. A 1 means there's a mine in one of the 8 tiles around, 2 means 2, and so forth.
---
#What happens if I click on a tile with a mine?
---
You lose.
---
100 keys?
---
The regular attack, explosive shells or sea urchins... Super, the head is thrown and becomes a mini-crab.

Idk dude I don't see why not. I bought Shiba Nita on a whim and do not regret it :)
---
will it work if there are actual players? wanna troll my friends
---
Well it maybe they did but then they should at least make it consistent with the description.
---
You bastard
---
No. That‚Äôs how it should work. You wanna try and carry a low power brawler that‚Äôs on you.
---
The star tokens should have been added on with the box points
---
The brawler requirement should have Been 300 for star points to be collected each season. 
---
They should have not changed the trophy progression. 
---
Siege was meant to be the big scary mode. Keep it that way. 
---
The star powers were a knock out of the park, nice job supercell. Although some are op/outshine others.
---
I've pushed Mortis to 500 twice, then another 400 on one of my smaller accounts. I've played this game for 2 years. There is nothing wrong with your game at all and this is pointless...

I assume this is a joke but without a bolt carrier it would seem quite difficult to consistently get bolts, especially against long range brawlers like Pam or Bo
---
But we were not in a team before.

Or maybe she's talking normally but her mask is in the way?

Thats not skill its called having a broken player

I didnt want to carry that noob
---
Cavern Churn is a fun map but not a good ranked map at all... It should be only brought back to friendly games
---
Keep grinding! I have 7800 so I cannot afford the 10k, either. But I'm working on getting my first brawler to 500
---
Except for ticks super, that destroys mortis-‚Äòbringer of doom‚Äô
---
Penny was then. And if that‚Äôs the case, then yes. They need to fix this. You shouldn‚Äôt be punished if you queued in by yourself.
---
Okay here‚Äôs a tip for your following memes
---
stop this lost in new shit it‚Äôs dumb and this was a good meme but title makes me want to downvote
---
We need more mods stat. Stupid posts like this are flooding new...
---
Way too many walls... Maybe removing some walls on the edges and the ones near spawn would help this map be more balanced. I personally like the idea of a bushless map tho
---
Can you draw mecha Bo and Crow like how you did Rico?
---
Allllll the mini-mines
---
Thanks.

[sad f2p noises]

This has been posted SO MANY TIMES. EVERYONE KNOWS THIS.
---
But skins are just cosmetic, they don't change the gameplay so they aren't necessary to be competitive. I am at around 11k trophy playing since late December last year and my highest level brawls aren't even halfway to level 9. Star powers can be unlocked without paying, but realistically it will probably take me a few more months to even get my first one.

That bull looked like he was lagging
