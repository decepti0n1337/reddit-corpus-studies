Why tf is Zero Deaths an OJ meme?

This is one of my fav maps except for stuff like that
---
Or Pam
---
Good bot
---
Thanks
---
Token doubler is probably better
---
Who is the beat brawlers then. As of right now?
---
Nice
---
 this map is really creative!
---
What is your age btw? This map is pretty complex and symmetric to be made by a child
---
6 star powers got leaked weeks ago. You can see it on YT.
---
Shouldve used gene!! But still quite funny😂😁👍
---
Accurate representation of 2054 when robots take all the jobs
---
He made a meme using this meme format. Maybe you saw that
---
Who is bottom right?
---
Wtf😂😂😂😂 how the hell can you be that damn dumb!?
---
Fits him very well
---
and that's true...
---
Great ideas, these are fantastic!
---
Yea he’s not weak by any chance but he could be better
---
Wow this map is great!😁👍

The woosh sub isn’t meant to be new it’s meant to put a label on stupid people so it’s not going anywhere
---
also jessie...
---
Not official yet but I saw actual gameplay of it. Shelly, Carl and Mortis third SP were also leakes. Shelly's aim-field will be thinner, Carl can destroy walls with his Ult and Mortis gains a shield when he dashes
---
why this subreddit is full of trash?
---
Poco and Jessie don’t. But I get what you mean.
---
Yea anyways
---
Rejoice
---
Congratulations!😁👍

Billy do the wrong thing, don't be like Billy

i guess he panicked :( so maybe he clicked and clicked auto aim..:(

But he had immunity...

Thank you very much

Ok

Mortis approves..
---
🚨 Spoiler alert 🚨 
---
There is actually game files for third star powers, and you got one right: Carl!
---
Bruh, you’re comment history is a mess
---
bruh 🙌💯💯💯👏
---
Most useless Jesse star power possible
---
What was the point
---
I smell a chick
---
It looks like the blue rockets that heavy gunner shoots in sonic mania
---
Yea
---
Yeah it kinda sucks that teaming doesn’t result in a ban.
---
It’s spelled mecha
---
It does
---
no thanks i would rather have 3 op brawlers than 4
---
Yesسنشوشوش🐴
---
You can try making an alt, going in, getting the mod's tag and name and then DM them on your real account to ask to be unbanned
---
Top one
---
LΜΛΘ
---
Idea isn’t viable because Supercell won’t give more star tokens/new panels, and siege doesn’t have anywhere else to go.
---
Wow do you not understand that it is normal to not have a legend at 2.8k
---
Mid is nice but outside needs work
---
i see you are also awake at 3 am
---
No mythic is normal too
---
Manda captura entonces
---
True gamer moments

should've had a "NO U" on that reverse card

I got it today too 👍

True dat
---
Explain how this is shitty. This took a good amount of effort
---
Pruébalo por favor
---
My first brawler I maxed out 
---
Nice drawing
---
Además si no tienes foto no tienes el record
---
I purposely tried out the skin so I could see what his animation was
---
q
---
You have 2.8k trophies, so 16 brawler is normal. Dont cry for a brawler, you will get one soon
---
Wow
---
To be fair supercats came out before global release right? Same with the tank game and a few others. I tried a few of those while I waited for them to actually let people play brawl stars...
---
its perform not perphorm
---
made myself
---
r/namechecksout
---
Both of these close in on a significant space of river, making the end of a showdown really odd
---
Yes he just commented on my post on nita art how it made him want to kill himself and me.
---
[removed]
---
No he made the meme template and also filled it out differently
---
No tienes foto
---
And my friends brother has Spike and Leon at 650 trophies.
---
Oh hi Mark
---
Or randoms are denying you one
---
I just maxed out today. Thanks
---
Waiting for him to comment here...
---
Clearly it is normal, because almost all my friends have a legendary and they are at around 1k to 2k.
---
Good randoms: 5% of populace
---
Good randoms willing to play again: 2% of populace.
---
If u told that to my 2k friend, he would laugh at all of u.
---
Cuz he is not missing a single mythic.
---
Ok kid I really don’t care, just appreciate what you have
---
Really nice drawing
---
What if i told you i already knew
---
Piper:NANI!?!
---
Tara: *ASCENDED*
---
Hmmmmmm tara has all them cards
---
Saw him call someone a dumbass on a Tara no u post
---
Annnnd... Power cubes?
---
*Gimme some sugar*
---
Yeeeees
---
That proud feeling.
---
I talked to him and looks like he will stop, he talk to me about suicide and another things, check my comments if you want
---
And also, 9 spawn places. :/
---
r/cursedimages
---
He's just tired.😅
---
Please no looks cool but not for Leon
---
I accidentally bought a shitty el primo skin because of my phone touchscreen glitching. This cheered me up. Thank you.
---
Are you feeling it now
---
If this post was sent 6 hrs ago, how was it this morning if it would be 3:00 pm
---
I get the reference but I have no idea what that means?
---
We all agree
---
Oh hell yeah
---
You must be kidding right?
---
My friend who have 16k thropies doesnt have Spike or Crow and u complaing about not having a single mythic?
---
pathetic.
---
Fact: when Tara uses her special on piper, piper can use her special to deflect the vortex. 
---
So reverse on that
---
He doesn't look like Brock, but he's right!
---
They
---
Thnx
---
Brock offically announced for GTA
---
you play way too much brawl stars to have a sane mind
---
How are you bad at him? All you have to do is hide in bushes and take out smaller brawlers and if not that then charge up ur super by throwing the blades at someone and then hide in a bush and active ur super and then find someone and beat them.
---
This is usually for showdown, but he’s good at gem grab also to sneak on the smaller brawlers.
---
If succeed in opening it the reward is every star power even if the brawler is not power 10 and every brawler you don’t have
---
This happened to
---
Me  MINE WAS ONE HUNDRED FIFTY
---
Damn i got 49 once but this is insane
---
True
---
Stonks
---
Thought it was a repost at first, but I was wrong it is a meme template thing.
---
How old is he?
---
You sir are a legend
---
oh ok no problem
---
The guy that counters bull? You can just keep aiming your shots ahead of them and make them run away.
---
Not really skill is a big thing is this game. You can spend all you want but you can still be shit at it.
---
No?
---
Bruh moment
---
wow. i didnt have any mythic, legendary, ( bibi, rosa and carl were not a thing btw) untill 6k, when i got spike and my luck went to like 0, since my next brawler was at 9k, being the new one rosa. then after i got bibi and tara.
---
and i still dont have carl.
---
I very much agree with that Crow one, the new one that's coming out is so trash, imo ofc
---
I like most of them and I don't have enough game time to tell how they should be balanced, but I do have some name changes.
---
Colt: Lucky Shot
---
Nita: BEARable Loss
---
Rico: Poppin' Pills
---
Darryl: On A Roll
---
Gene: Lend A Hand
---
Carl is my name seizing the means of production is my game
---
Balanced^
---
Wait that is ilegal
---
There is so much trolling potential for Gene's super and I hate it. It'd be fun for friendly matches but seeing people use it to screw teammates over and lose trophies is a terrible thought
---
Not sure how you figure that, a legendary starts at level 9 (tournament standard) and can be pulled from a silver chest (albeit you need great rng) 
---
Commons and rares are obtained easily. The only cards hard to get to tournament standard are epics since you can only request 4 a week from your clan (on Sundays). 
---
Getting a legendary to max (level 13) can be costly but again you can trade with clanmates, get lucky, they sell a legendary a day for in game coins, and commonly sell legendary chests for $9.99 or less and that doesn't touch tournaments, the new trophy road, the battle pass, etc etc.
---
But if two people play against each other with similar skill level one that payed for an advantage will always win be the free to play guy. That's pay to win.
---
Lol...
---
holy shit, so much meme potential
---
*Happy Darryl noise’s*
---
**Very poor choice of words**
---
Ikr bruh
---
ah ok. well oof then
---
Cálmate solamente entaba diciendo capaz que si tenía el record no se
---
Ok they remember this
---
How many cards do you get from each chest, how many does it take to upgrade each card, and how much do the chests cost?
---
it’s ok
---
That was insane!
---
I spent 6 hours on a art and i think it is good. And my ftiends which dont have reddit say it will be the greatest art in the world. Then what i rrcieve is 17 downvotes
---
Yeee
---
I dont like the idea, but i like your arts, so cutr
---
A prophet
---
Why is spikes so bad 😂😂
---
i like this! (hopefully it isnt a repost...)
---
 Not good at drawing
---
I need
---
Holy god, I was thinkin this today!
---
No u
---
Didnt you drew this?
---
You can make it I believe in you
---
Yes
---
That el primo can suck a dick
---
Got artwork
---
No Don you see  a I edited
---
Dont let those aliens see you
---
Piper: No u! 
---
Tara: REVERSE CARD
---
Piper: wait what
---
hahahahahahahaha!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
---
Oh, then
---
He got it 4 hours ago when he posted it.
---
rule34 says otherwise. It’s all about Shelly and piper.
---
u/trikshot360 please perm ban this guy
---
Almost identical scenario for me, 6.2k and missing all legendaries + all mythics + Piper
---
I play Frank most in BB and I love spinning. It's way too damn fun. Just two little rotations and then put it in
---
Frank : HEY I USE POCO 1st STAR POWER IN FRIENDLY GAME
---
you mean extra noxious? because extra toxic is crows star power
---
Bruh there is only 3 players in a team how can jessies orb bounce 4 times
---
Yeah but it’s just a TOXIC way to get them
---
No!!!!, I mean when someone joins a team they automatically get the team code so if they leave they again join by entering the code
---
thank u
---
https://youtu.be/F4ZWrkV6wFo
---
Of all things, brawl stars too?
---
Not really his fault when there’s no better way
---
Thank you😄
---
I like your idea for Barley but I have a suggestion, instead of healing himself, he heals himself and his teammates?
---
That looks awesome dude, hey i Drew a meme template can u use it i took time doing it and some said i was a waste of sperm and i really felt ofended
---
They automatically get the team code written underneath their "invite player" option
---
Cut me a bit of slack... So far plants are hard to handle.
---
It hurts to laugh
---
I’m new
---
Don’t know how to get pictures to work :’(
---
Can we just undo trophy inflation 
---
PLEASE
---
Anytime man (つ &gt;ω●)つ
---
That's so weird I watch hella Brawl Stars videos and been in hella teams but never heard about that or noticed it. Imma look out for it next time I'm playing.
---
Bibi is so good rn. This guy really needs a therapist
---
No, cause stupid trophy inflation lets you push practically any good brawler in about 2 to 3 hours to 500.
---
Bubblegum is Secretly op
---
But my art has my name though so...
---
However, My art has my name on it. So...
---
Hell yaa!!
---
It is too op lol, so is shellies, although chicky cant be worse than bandaid
---
Well dont upgrade brawlers to lvl 9
---
Dont take his girlfriend
---
You should try contacting supercell support
---
That's the company of brawl stars
---
Especially on brawl ball.
---
Then Brock could fire a M.O.A.B and Gene could push away brawlers.
---
Mecha crow is 300 gems as well, only spikes skin was 150
---
Thank you but it is impossible my legendary chance is 0.0902
---
Epic escape
---
🤡
---
Thanks!
---
Lmao salty af
---
*made with mematic*
---
Mortis gang will rise up on you
---
😉
---
Love it
---
You can get any brawler from 0 to 500 in 2days easily
---
What the fuck is going on?
---
This needs more updoots
---
Lmao piper is quite good if you can hit your shots
---
Brawl stars for switch
---
Showdown boxes, turrets,.
---
So That Mean After 2 More Year Crow Is Paradise
---
Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck
---
I know I changed him and nerfed him in a repost
---
I HATE WHEN PEOPLE DON'T COMMENT ON GOOD WORK, UPVOTE!
---
peTItIoN tO fIx mATcHmaKInG
---
Simple solution, just do what I do and not have any
---
Ok then, Barley heals just 200 health
---
He was either in a room, or he was a bot.
---
Lmao dumbass does fake posts
---
Youd rather that be real?
---
In my opinion no because you can get legendaries easier
---
r/woooosh for you bud. I don’t think you understood it was a joke
---
If you get sandwiched by many players as Poco, you can die, but at least heal your teammates so they can rush and not die too.
---
I see you missed the big "STARTING AT"
---
yOu MaKe mE Un PoCo LoCo!
---
Very nice idea+nice skin
---
Nothing against ya, but I already hate this template
---
Bibi now heals only 450 and only one time. Mama's oil sounds very NSFW
---
This game already sucks, i tried it after the global update, and it is still not like this, alright, we have to ban this game
---
I nerfed it to 10 hp per bounce in the repost
---
9.5 the water is going to be so evil
---
that my mini acounts i didnt reach out
---
For ps4 and switch?
---
You should’ve put in a Red Bull instead
---
WATCH THE REPOST
---
Guess you could say you got the jump on him.
---
Because WATCH THE REPOST 😂😂😂😂😂
---
I didn't know that
---
f2p
---
Makes me want to play mc again
---
What?
---
I unlocked mortis at 1am
---
Yap
---
No
---
You should, thats impressive
---
R/wOoOoSh
---
I buffed Spike in a repost
---
Crow is good against tanks
---
Mortis can push away tanks from him, or push damaged enemies to stronger teammates
---
Tara doesn'r usually get her super and is completely balanced. It's not 10 it's 1 second
---
Bo hits enemies from further easier
---
Gene probably but still good to save teammates from awkard situations
---
I nerfed El Primo in a repost
---
Barley is also nerfed to 200 health not 500
---
Poco is not a showdown brawler
---
It would be way easier to super with Darryl because you can escape easier, and travel further
---
Carl is actually having 3rd star power that can break walls so even the Supercell made a more OP version of this star power
---
Frank needs faster attack speed. It only sounds OP on paper but when you try it almost doesn't change anything and Frank would be more useful. And most of the players don't even have star powers because it's hard to get them.
---
Good enough
---
Sad but true
---
She is 16 I'm 13 (also sub to pewdiepie)
---
thanks for clarifying everything! they look really good, and i hope they actually become star powers! :)
---
Spike's is just a worse Band Aid
---
And you just recycled Poco's old SP
---
10h+ everyday on the PC? OUCH.
---
n o
---
Removed - DO NOT SUBMIT POSTS WITH TITLES IN ALL CAPS. CAPS LOCK IS CRUISE CONTROL FOR COOL
---
I didn't know about poco old star power
---
Just wanted to say Genes SP is useless because the second SP will be that you can pull your friend and this will heal them
---
dynamike:are u sure about that
---
بلاك صياح خلاص

Yo también soy de México

Dienamike

Beautiful
---
Skull creek that’s it!
---
That was actually really cool
---
Looks like Leon will never get a skin or evolution
---
Thanks for stealing my meme lol.But you did a better job so its ok
---
i would die instant
---
I’d rather get a tara buff
---
Well I don't have any replays but today a Piper w/ Energy Drink killed me in Showdown even after my Band-Aid bar is fully charged. True story.
---
Am i the only one that thinks poco's third star power is like his old one?
---
Some brawlers blink, like Crow, Jessie, Mortis, and others.
---
Im pretty sure they didn't even know what happend, they saw an enemy, they killed it
---
You also steal my power point drop rate
---
666 likes seems fitting
---
Thanks, I’ll definitely make more
---
Carl's new star power will be cutting bushes and walls with his super, so this one is kinda useless
---
Oh ok never mind are you saving for the gold mechas or when non cosmetic items like boxes are out
---
You, my man, ARE A LEGEND
---
''Why isn't this guy crediting Supercell for using their *art''*
---
You got him on your back
---
r/unexpectedundertale
---
This need to be in game,it's really a cool idea,good work👍
---
:(
---
Exactly
---
WHAT ABOUT LEON
---
I like the concept, but I have a feeling it's going to be hard to use emotes while playing so they won't be bought as much.
---
Darryl have some skins
---
Wait what
---
Star platinum
---
Its a Brawl Stars rip off called Super Cats
---
ZERO DEATHS
---
You just need to learn how to use him, getting him to at least Rank 15 was easy BEFORE the trophy buff.
---
There the same picture
---
i am was wsiting for non cosmetic items but i accidentally waste 10k (sry for bad english)
---
It's good I hope they come out soon
---
i tried the game, jeeze you dont get the option to dodge bullets either you literally move around so fricking slowly that its bare able to dodge
---
I would literally buy this
---
Lmao that Pilipino comm memes xD
---
Oh :(
---
:)
---
He looks so cute hahaha i love the various reactions he has!😆👍
---
Someone just posted a 20 seconds record right now on this sub
---
My friend had 1600 trophies and all 3 legendaries
---
10
---
Yes, Congratulations!
---
Insane
---
I like this, as almost every brawler is viable here. Maybe work on the edges a bit (spawn areas)
---
Buy two token doublers for 100 gems and with the rest buy tickets
---
Nvm I beat it again with 25 seconds instead of 28 seconds
---
How many tokens does that award?
---
Why do you ship them
---
Removed. Keep your post titles descriptive and provide context. Additionally do not use low effort/all caps/clickbait titles.
---
Crow
---
You’re calling for a dynamike nerf? He’s one of the worst brawlers in the game. Maybe his demolition star power?
---
30
---
why not +4
---
Although fairly reliant on the star power.
---
'Tara is a girl'
---
*Lesbians entered the chat*

genius

STOLEN
---
Well, wanna become a Stuka and kill a crowd? Play Piper!
---
Shelly: OH IM GONNA BEAT YA SO HARD UNTILL YOU HAVE A TWINCH
---
It should be invisible/visible more slowly
---
Laggy game with shitty graphics
---
ender Leon
---
Bruh🖖🖖🖖🖖🖖🖖
---
bruh 💪👏👏🤙🙌
---
This needs to be added, so you can encourage your teammates if they played well.
---
You're asking for a Frank, Jessie, El Primo and Rosa Nerf?
---
At how many trophies are you?
---
Barley is MOOD
---
Never taunt with energy drink as the mod
---
No, because in a draw 3 vs 3 whit 6 leons it will be really weird.
---
Nice concept, you make really good ones too.
---
No wtf
---
9.5 / 10
---
r/cursedbrawlstars
---
That's amazing
---
I cannot believe this XDDDDD
---
Edit: lost the first round 
---
Oops 😬
---
In uno with 2 people if it is Terras turn and she plays a  reverse and it goes back to terra. But I get what you mean
---
Tick is soo cute OwO
---
Yikes. 😳
---
Yeah same
---
This would make more sense if barley was the girl, I mean she’s literally throwing bottles
---
LOL 😂
---
Everyone will pick Steel Hops
---
Who’s Template
---
Wdym
---
Nice effort
---
Yeeeeee
---
there are so few people in the world that this actually affects and even fewer of those people buy the skin and also you don’t have to buy the skin smh
---
Kecleon is a legendary in pokemon mistery dungeon. If you steal something from his merchendise, he will kill you very quick. He is like leon. But if leon sees people teaming, he will kill them very quick.
---
Are you the Leon, Nita, or Brock?
---
Yep
---
Now add their blushes
---
I was waiting for the enemy El Primo to jump into their spawn with 10 gems.
---
xD, I’m an optimistic man, I open boxes expecting nothing just for the sake of increasing the chance of a legendary brawl.
---
Oops it’s u/XpyRay
---
Salt!
---
Isnt carls third star power is breaking blocks and bushes and other stuff????????
---
Wont it impair vision?
---
I love cats! this could be the next big thing. Downloading now :)
---
I think gene's star power should be: pull freindly brawlers when they are low heatlh
---
Yes.
---
 Lol super cat is so good game much better than brawl stars also i am antivax and my name is karen /s
---
Actually I don't know 😀
---
r/shittybrawlstars

What the f are you talking about?

What is that ruler for?

Gemcraft

GG!
---
happy cake day!
---
I would have delay and  franks super would hit me before i aim my super.Just like every time when i use piper's super.
---
Nita bear: dies
---
Super: charges to 50%
---
SIMPLE AS THAT!
---
you know things are going to get  when you see a white crow on the enemy team
---
Cry? Haha good joke I'm not a kid dude. I have a bunch of friends from good random out there,but I'm a solo player, because so many noobs random. And i only play team in really a rare times base on map.
---
You know things are going to get tough when you see a white crow on the enemy team
---
yeah and gene too...
---
He isn't great as he can't shoot energy drink as a REAL Kyle.
---
Joke he is awesome.
---
used it for the legs
---
Lukiebear would get like 4 minutes
---
Haha😀
---
That’s what makes it fun though and even then just mute them if they bother you so much
---
I honestly feel bad for them tho...
---
Not too long. I got one about a week or so (maybe even less) after upgrading to 9.
---
Ah yes this is a nita friend?
---
Awesome. What did you use to make this?
---
Thanks :)
---
He’s saying you’re stupid for thinking they are balanced. It’s not nice to say someone is stupid, especially to someone who has that high of trophies, but I kinda have to agree with him. Piper has consistently been bad since her introduction is only good in Bounty and some Heist Maps. Her main issue is how you are forced to attack from long range since her close up Damage is bad. Tara is definitely better than Piper, but she could use a small buff too. If you are offended by this I apologize. I never intended too in any way of form
---
Im all of them
---
So you say "Men" dont cry?
---
What do you mean stolen ? There is over 100 people made this meme before me or after so shut up
---
yes but if you keep getting 10th...
---
Oh, because i never draw with rulers except for templates, try draw straight lines without rulers, ptactice more, i used 3 hours to learn it, some of the templates, i even did not use rulers
---
I main Crow because I hate those filthy mudmen
---
same
---
As one who push on gem grab, its extremely relatable.
---
no u 🙏🙏🙏
---
Well, make something up. Maybe he is a secret friend but is from a different tribe and other tribes can’t interact peacefully so they sneak away sometimes to play together.
---
i have 3 cards to
---
enjoy your silver ;)
---
Pliz fix it💔
---
that actually makes a lot of sense, thanks man
---
Foarte fain!
---
cuz these people are asses
---
Why? I’m curious
---
Be y'all stars, the new redneck sensation
---
Discount were removed for newly released bro just like season tokens.U will sometimes get discount in shop only.
---
Brawl star is growing pretty fast so they have no intention to give free stuffs now. Focus on progression and maxing out brawlers.
---
Yeah then I'd choose one of the other star power
---
Yes, they cry but not for this little things.
---
Pam, spike and carl is so good, but you need to learn drawing the lines of the face
---
can it shoot? 
---
/s
---
That is great idea!
---
uh this IS dynamike
---
Yeah, pretty much.
---
Yeah they are a little op but unique
---
Yes it does,before supercell did the trophies buff 400 was pretty much and it was decent players but now its just noobs in 400 trophies.
---
The best face
---
Nice work ❤
---
o she dummy thicc
---
You're at 4000....... countless people at 10k have onlh like 21
---
Thx
---
Or that could be Leon’s role and Kyle is just a friend in NITA’S tribe and they both love her so they fight for her
---
Darryl's 1st star power is a better dive in siege
---
on summer,they did make a discount for the summer skins...

There are 2 tribes. Wolfs and Bears. Both tribes are fighting eachother, while Nita (from Bear tribe) and Kyle (from Wolf tribe) like eachother

Oooooh

Guys it's a null brawl

Nice idea, but the fact that you only did some ms paint coloring is kinda dissapointing
---
Ahahaha I know and it's funny

Can confirm because I'm always that brock

Lmao big game is only for star key. Even if the game is very much one sided it still gives very few keys like 24-25. While in robo rumble it's almost guaranteed to have &gt;28 trophy if you use a proper brawler with &gt;500 trophy even queued with random.
---
Nice meme mate!
---
Good job man. 👏👏👏
---
It’s brilliant!
---
It doesn't even make sense
---
Most of the healing related sp are way too op 
---
Except piper, spike and poco(i am not totally sure)
---
Bo arrow traveling closer is kind of a nerf because spreading arrows guarantees the hit(most of the time)
---
Overall idea isn't bad it must took you long time
---
Well done ⬆️

EXCUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUSE ME GAME

#Downvote him to hell boys
---
Idk about you guys but this skin is great!
---
Roger that! xD
---
So no one saw this?! You really need more people to see your great skins, they’re amazing!
---
Kyle looks like a Nita skin xD
---
Light is for people who need skin but do not have gems and golden is for showing dominance i mean if someone actually bought it he will be considered a god because he collected 50k points
---
He waited to long to go in. He should've killed frank when he had him at bottom left.
---
WOW, how original
---
I'm the person to hate-I often get the higher
---
This hit me hard😔
---
Yes, YEs, YES
---
Great gob!
---
Emotes like these will just lead to more teaming
---
Tfw I made the same exact post and it didn’t take off like yours 
---
F in that chat
---
I think they should add voice commands thar function like tf2 so they contain like "incoming"
---
"go go go" "thanks etc.
---
I have one of these too! It's crow, and i had a nita, piper and crow card. My cousin has a Mortis with a bull head. Where'd you get it from?
---
Kingu Crimusonu skipped time, so I will not explode ^^
---
I'm at 11k and still missing 2 mythics and all the legendarys😢
---
Whats the sense of emotes, spamming at the end of the game? No, i don't think so but it's the sad truth and if everybody muted the emotes nobody would see your emotes, that is why buying them would just be a waste of starpoints.
---
I would buy it. Do it supercell please

it basically started out as a "calling out the overused jokes" sub, i have no idea how did they got to what they are now and thats sad

honestly that little belt that the barrel has should be attached to dynamike's chest
---
I hate this shameless rip-off so much
---
Never said that...I just sorted by new and found this. Sorry I offended you by being positive towards someone else. Just bc I didn’t see yours doesn’t mean I won’t like it...
---
Im a fellow Bo-er too. I need to get Bo added to my name or something, especially because i'm a Bo main. Bo is so strong haha.
---
It's a joke saying that the colt super was terrible and missed the safe completly
---
Gene is very good, only Mortis needs a buff, and Tara needs a rework
---
It actually happened to me in a game of uno
---
Yesn't
---
I’m not saying they should REPLACE the other currency with coins. Just that maybe it should be an option. A skin could be 180 gems OR 100,000 coins. It still gives F2P players something to work towards. I understand it’s still a business, but I just wish there was another option for the coins. ESPECIALLY since they keep giving you coins in boxes once everyone’s maxed.
---
Aye dont forget about my -bot- boy tick
---
I bet you don't know what homophobe means I bet your 12 and you just heard that word and is copying the internet
---
Salutare, alt roman :))
---
Then what did you mean
---
I loved barley
---
Well spinning already exists so there’s no problem with adding emotes that could be used for teaming
---
It's cool but i think that the people who spawn in the middle will be a significant disadvantage unless close range brawler, or Bo.
---
What are you talking about? 1.5% chance is very high, higher than star powers.
---
That was sarcasm
---
Gotcha. Since I'm not too good at animating, I'll just draw circles and pretend they're the Brawlers. But it should turn out good anyway.
---
Thanks! yours also looks good ;)
---
In one of the comments
---
Full roster everyone 500 and I'd have to say I'm bored at this point. Skins don't do nothing for me so there is no reason to push.

They need to add in new player levels

Damn, Brock got nerfed.

I agree.

its like a new skin for nita Lol

Amazing work

Wait what?

I Understand. Lol good job

Good human

Not sure if this is a troll or genuine
---
The creator sended this in the comments, literally
---
I take that as a great compliment, thank you
---
Piper: you got no skins
---
Tara: Uno Reverse card!
---
And that's why they don't have skins
---
You were saying ew to a ship of 2 women
---
OwO

Yes. Please.

Salut

He made 1k Dynamike last season
---
You ruined the chain you clown
---
Oh NeverMind, the creator deleted it
---
Don't make it take only one to enter.   
---
3 at least I would say, because it would take just one Mortis to dash over, especially with his new star power.  
---
Imagine 5 mortis, that'd be hell.
---
thanks! i really appreciATE it!😁😂
---
Congrats. Spike is very well rounded and is very good everywhere except bounty
---
Well I guess you want the game to crash because they need to make some sort of revenue. Not many people pay for gems to buy skins. Mega boxes aren’t worth spending real money on.
---
Rip spike
---
We. Don't. Need. Emotes.
---
I wasn't talking about those....
---
This isn’t skill (or are you sarcastic?)
---
I love it
---
I know your pain in my country 3 top playeros moved to steal the 1 place
---
Don't hate me hate how they don't manage their game, and crow's poison and how long it lasts.
---
this is what im saying from the launch, the game needs emotes! you need to somehow communicate with others. and for the fragile players that are afraid of so called “toxicity” it would be available only in 3v3 modes (so nothing in showdown, and only visible by your teammates) so it doesnt work for teaming or something like that
---
Yes, and then if he doesn't attack he heals normaly about 400 health like every other brawler.
---
You know a power 1 0 trophy brawler with star would be op and unfair for players who are not lucky enough to get star power so early
---
Sure!
---
Well if a meme doesn't make any sense and is incorrect, then it's not funny. You can't just say something random that's incorrect and say "Hey this is just a meme"
---
You asshole , just leave him be , he says he doesn't want to give him a remodel so shut the f#ck up
---
But he did not gave credit
---
She got greedy and died.
---
No, supercell are on vacation
---
Attack speed is rate at which you can fire(fire rate), but since you are limited by only having three bullets, attack speed is completely irrelevant to have in almost any situation. E.g.: you use your tick super with only 0 ammo or 1 ammo left. What you might have meant is 'reload speed'
---
There is a reason bull's super increases his reload speed and not attack speed
---
Yeah. Shell shock is infinitely better. She doesn’t stay alive long enough to charge band aid and as big brawler it helps her survive maybe 4 extra seconds.
---
I don’t understand mobile. Never used it. Ignore this guy I’m replying to. But Bo having 4 mines was a very old decision by supercell back when Tara and Pam was new. Then the fixed duplicate brawlers accept everyone was Bo. His rarity was also super rare instead of epic so it made things worse. No 4 mines.
---
i mean yes, but no, its not as difficult to quickly press a button while hiding in bush or running behind wall and not shooting so you can signalize your team to push or defend or run back with gems and hide
---
That brock is me in bounty,i get bullied in a corner
---
I was just putting something out there. Sorry i guess
---
Trophies don't matter but Frank has insane range, El primo has insane damage and abnormal movement speed, Jessie needs to have her attack do 2 chains instead of 3, and Rosa's attack, super resistance, and hoe many projectiles she puts out in a single shot is insane.
---
you're no match for the power of my stand「Mecha Crow」
---
Alright. I'll work on it as much as possible, then send you the link.
---
oh no, there's teaming, ooh.
---
I know it's a joke but Brawl Stars is free so why wouldn't your mom let you play it ?
---
Okay. I don’t really care for Spike’s third Star Power idea, but I know that you spent a lot of time working on all 27 Star Powers, so I’ll give you that. Some of the Star Powers are better than others, and some are useless (kind of like Jessie’s, my opinion, no offense).  But that doesn’t mean that all of the hard work spent creating this went to waste. It still took a lot of time and effort to think of ideas for these Star Powers.
---
Yeah i gotta restart my internet to even get one non lag game
---
When I say speed boost I mean a boost in movement speed, nothing to do with ammo
---
Ignorance is bliss, am I right? The toxicity is there - people like you (and myself) choose to ignore it because it doesn’t phase us. 
---
But other people aren’t like us my friend, they don’t handle things the way we do.
---
Plus, our perception of perfection is on completely different spectrums.
---
Yas
---
Sorry to interrupt but I think you got it wrong. It says " Speed " as in movement speed. Not reload speed. And the name is "Weightless" So for obvious reasons it's movement speed that he is talking about.
---
Bet! Have a nice day XD
---
💕
---
Yes, I’ll like my ego burnt please
---
Have you played this game?
---
Well high movement speed just defeats the purpose of a tank and El primos damage and fire rate of the burst is pretty high the only thing slow is his reload speed. And Bull has decent health but not low.
---
Oh and people that play goalie. Like just goalie. I met a Primo that waited in the crease the whole game and when his time came, he couldn’t make the save ffs. Like the ball can be on offense and they’ll still stay in the crease
---
The shelly
---
Your idea is great. But I have an idea aswell
---
Dynamike 3rd Star Power: "Last Bomb"
---
When Dynamike dies he leaves a bomb ( similar to his super ) where he dies. This damages enemies.
---
This will be useless in Solo showdown but I guess this will be very helpful in 3v3 games.
---
What editing software did you use
---
Cossss so lucky
---
Frank shouldn't be nerfed. I agree to give him a range nerf, but if you do so, he does need a damage buff for example.
---
El Primo has average speed and his very small ranges does up for his damage. 
---
Jessie is currently one of the worst Brawler or even the worst in the game. She needs a buff and no nerf.
---
Rosa got a lot of nerfs. Her super last only for a short period of time and her damage isn't that much.
---
r/unexpected
---
WINGS OF GLORY
---
"has been bad since her introduction"
---
She was literally the most overpowered brawler since she was released. She isn't not good in other modes because of her stats, she's not good in other modes because of her mechanics. She has a high skill cap, that's all. Tara does not need a buff, she has weak basic attacks but high burst damage and what I would consider the most powerful super in the game. She is good in everything except heist in my opinion.
---
3v3v3v1 its impossible to play
---
Very cool. Nice attac! But he (she?) is like Nita!
---
Go for it
---
Np, templates are good too, I'm rooting for ya. ;)
---
Thats good
---
We score in brawl ball
---
Ok Carl 😂
---
Oh right, I forgot when she was introduced like day one she was busted. Especially in the old Brawl Ball. She got patched quickly though. I guess you got some points, I think Tara is Balanced now, but would a small buff to Piper in some stat be that dramatic?
---
 like you card
---
Why does this always happen tho?
---
A little... Thicc?
---
no the one the dynamike bird
---
Unlucky, i had no legendaries at 6k and then three legendaries at 7k

Better run better run

That is how it works in game.

Jessie tried to shoot me, I dodge it, than it hits my teammate, and then after that it’ll target me bc it never hit me.

Good job in your pumpkin spike too, I really liked it
---
Yeah but cavern churn is where it happens the most... well for me don’t know about you but other maps I have been on you never see teaming it’s only this specific one I get teamed on hard
---
Tq
---
Dont do that, dont give me hope
---
On other maps you never see teaming? You must be pretty low on trophies.
---
I saw this meme right after seeing a post telling people to stop doing that because the leaderboards are filled with foreigners
---
Not supposed to correct you, i was just following the line :)
---
nah I’m at 4442 trophies
---
Spikes seems to be the most useless
---
That's pretty low.
---
GEE I WONDER WHY
---
Why?
---
Colts should be New Magazine, Barley should be for teammates, and Poco’s 3rd is the same how it was in beta for a while.
---
All they need is Rosa when she is first released
---
Yeah I've never been able to pass above 4600 trophies because I always get people who either play antisocial decks (elite-barbs...) or because they have all cards in their deck at max level. I hope brawl stars don't get to p2w dependet. I am currently at 10.6K trophies as a F2P player and I don't think that P2W are WAY better than F2P unlike CR where you get smashed down by P2W.

Nothing besides  shelly with bandaid
---
Correct

When I hear a crow as Leon I charge up my super as fast as I cab and go straight to the crow, even if they havent seen me all game, theyre just annoying

4 My sick 2000 IQ internet connection but BrawlStars says no
---
Why?? 😢😢😢💔 I thought it would be a good idea
---
Lets not forget those cheap 1000% rip-off Clash Royale games. I mean, jesus, the most popular Clash Royale rip-off even got promoted/highlighted in App Store.
---
Yeah true but then legendaries wouldn’t be so legendary anymore
---
Not yet
---
Because they wont give free stuff, grow up
---
Yeah but this Subreddit is obsessed with Mortis
---
I understand but these types of posts are not allowed here, trust me... delete this post before you start getting downvoted
---
I think a pretty cool skin could be released
---
Grr

---
It works though
---
Does it work. 😁

What major billion dollar company does donations, they would get a ton of backlash from adding ads due to them never doing it before and with all the monetization and shit happening in gaming period(2k, EA, etc)  “sponsorships” don’t work like that. You have investors. And they want to see there getting there money’s worth so you need to pay them back. Esports is probably coming soon but the game is too lackluster(not enough options) at the moment. Maybe when 3 man showdown comes its a option.
---
perfectly balanced as all things should be
---
LOL
---
Niceeeee
---
Great idea
---
REPOST
---
TAKI TAKI RUMBA
---
Can you make me one? Lol love it btw
---
not a woooosh
---
xp **unluck** road
---
Well, thanks for the feedback! I tried arranging the emotes on the screen in a way so it won't interfere with the player.
---
how am i supposed to use Discord with randoms?? if you have a team of friends of course the best is to use discord, but with randoms its better to ude emotes or commands. i suggested emotes, because its more fun (not really annoying at least for majority of people) and its easier to understand picture with corner of your eye than read a text mid-battle. also supercell would make money because the “commands” could be bought (for example celebrating etc)
---
i agree with you, Supercel's opinion is changing, but isn't enough. They said that with new stuff like meteor shower the teaming will decrease, but meteor shower increase the teaming, only healing decrease a bit the teaming.
---
Yes, you could, just like in Clash Royale
---
Try “Moe kicks Barney out of bar meme template” in google
---
Since 250 boxes i didn't get any brawler and i just need a legendary. My rate is at 0.5
