I like how i got all the mythicals before getting one epic lol
---
You have ascended passed perfection. Well done
---
It definitely does. Nice catch!
---
Oh... Sorry, using Google translate
---
How do you have -758 gems
---
for sure
---
thanks for informing me
---
Yeah but I still dont get the huge trophy difference
---
Wdym I got reddit after getting most brawlers. All but mythics and legendaries so I didn‚Äôt post the brawlers before I got reddit.
---
Uno reverse card activated
---
Yeah, ww all have to stop teamers
---
Oh yeah and thanks mate
---
I mean it‚Äôs not bad. A little messy on the sides and might need more symmetry to not give the enemy an unfair advantage. Overall pretty goo-IS THAT A MOTHERFUCKING ONE TILE GAP?!!
---
Wheeeeze
---
 No
---
It‚Äôs not a serve... it‚Äôs a game
---
Oh yes you must be right. That‚Äôs why we see pocos all over showdown at high levels
---
I don‚Äôt have pam toxic boi and invis
---
My mini's at 4.5k and it only has 13 brawlers, no epics, no mythicals and no legendaries. Opened 70 boxes from robo rumble and got nobody :D
---
I have the J3 Eclipse, feels bad man.
---
F
---
I like the idea but I can see trolls just using it to run you into the storm
---
great!
---
A lot of them are genuinely creative and well done though.
---
Brawl Ball, Heist, Gem Grab, Bounty, and Siege maps have to be diagonally mirrored, but otherwise, :)
---
P.S. 1 tile gaps ARE bad :(
---
No we don‚Äôt need curried in brawl stars
---
bo
---
And so? That doesn't make up for no thropies at all
---
he so bad omg
---
Ok
---
Yeah the bull doesnt win and he gets further away.
---
Shelly wins.
---
UwU
---
Got her! And I'm already addicted, she's so fun, even in modes where there are much better options.
---
I have Colt at 600, But my total trophies are 5000
---
No, but I am prepared to lose 175 trophies on my crow üò•
---
Thus why he deserves to be bullied he doesnt have more original skins than recolors
---
Oh shut up
---
yeah, but bull will still be alive, and this is if the shelly is smart
---
DO IT DIRTY GEMMING FOR LIFE
---
But everyone spent they money on whatever they want. I'm an adult and for me spending in any hobby is just normal, it's my money and I can use it on brawl star or Mc Donalds... or both ü§î
---
feels like 49 Gems for 49 Mega Boxes
---
JK
---
The fact that she has a bat and can't hit anyone on top of her like that is the main reason I don't waste my time playing her. For real? A true melee brawler that can't melee at the closest range?
---
But that‚Äôs how matchmaking works. That‚Äôs why you shouldn‚Äôt play with people way above or below your trophy level
---
its the doing of canyadigit
---
Those are some strange looking feet but whatever, nice art.
---
but they are cooler (except whiteh
---
Congrats yo! Push him, he's epic
---
Got him to 507 today
---
Lol the sound
---
Shut up and stop whining
---
[removed]
---
You just dont know how to play him.
---
Yeah so dont be mad when they do what they want, it's your dumbass fault for spending money on a game.
---
You can spend your money, I dont care. But dont get mad when they make things easier for f2p.
---
Ha ha totally not done before, u funny ha ha he he
---
dang dude, that sucks, if only i could donate money to you :/
---
K
---
Now hand over thy karma
---
I got leon from a free box
---
It‚Äôs still a star power so be grateful
---
El Machamp used seismic slam! The enemy got 10 gems! El Machamp fainted!

The one on the left has more tax on it üòà
---
U do realize that is a bird
---
Very nice!
---
The middle still has 1 tile gaps. As the map is already a busy one, consider removing one or two things (e.g the water in the centre) other than that, much improvement!
---
Can't wait for Mortis's Coiled Snake

No u

Oh I actually got a meme ima post tmw on that ;)

Remove them from the game and brawlstars is 10000000000% better

Probably a noob, he‚Äôs good.

I got Leon on my other account by opening boxes randomly bot I got Carl in my account here
---
I just got my first mythic ever two days ago and its my favourite one too, Mortis! He's so fun
---
Yeah it sucks and the last time they buffed her they buffed her super: literally the only reason to play her without bandaid as is. They need to tweak the power difference between normal Shelly and Shelly with super
---
I'm a poco main and I think poco is strong enough as is, it's just that you don't play him right... And I also hate brawl ball...
---
P.S. I just got crow yesterday and I believe he's good too...
---
How do you unlock showdown whiteou whining any 3vs3
---
There‚Äôs people with 13,000 trophies and no legendary you shouldn‚Äôt complain
---
Lol this episode came on tv today which is why I got the idea
---
Thanks bro
---
I N S A N E 
---
I can't believe this, you definatly deserve an award!
---
He cannot kill fast (being an assassin btw), so either he has to die or somehow fill his super up which takes a load of attacks to load up. His super is so rare to get, that once I get it I get too excited and waste it instantly. But at the same time, I don't think he needs a more than a slight buff, cuz that'll make him OP.
---
*Cries in being targeted by 3 teams at once*

I took your servey. Nice job on making this form!

Can you make it so Darrly can roll infinitely in this map?

My el primo is 507 from brawl ball
---
That's something ü§†ü§†
---
Let me ask u something, when u play mortis do u just go around fighting brawlers?
---
Because if u do, that's not how u play him.
---
El primo has lower range than mortis, and he is slower than mortis.
---
So does that mean el primo is weaker? No just play him right.
---
bie bie youtubers. i m not watching any of you supercell sponsored channels until u talk about season rewars. you all are like crocodiles. shading fake tears when f2p are affected and making episodes after episodes when ur elite friends are efftected.

we cant still watch quality content if we want to via bobby og yde and others pros . but i feel sad that i wont be watching my fav youtubers lex and kairos(i dont watch other people only (lex kairos ash and rey) .

they will rant for their elite friends episode after episode  but when it comes to f2p they will talk for 2 mins and thats it

how did this get 133?

Supercell servers would melt if everybody had replays. By the way, with the new trophy changes It's way easier to climb to 400 trophies :)

9 shellys with band aid against a piper

That's because that's *all* you can do with him. He's not viable in the meta at all.

Merci beaucoup :)

Did everyone get Band-Aid?

What power crow did you use?

No, buff Mortis but there's nothing wrong with Dynamike. They just gave him a +1000 damage super FFS.

---
1) I play mortis on solo motherfucker, so fuck off will u.
---
Yes sometimes i do play 3v3 WITH people I dont know. So you can fuck off there aswell.
---
2)"you pay him a certain playstyle" well shit I didnt realize different brawlers had the same play style? Jeez really makes the brawlers unique right? 
---
Fuck off will u

3) I am not a pro, I am apart of the 99% it's just the dumbass 0.9% that you are in that make filing decisions.

Huh?

Haha man I swear its really tough like I can't arsed to keep pushing those 3 guys because I have other brawlers to push as so is the situation with many other players so we end up with nothing at the end of the season üòÇüíî

What happen here?

You don't have win in 3v3, solo / Duo showdown it strange

Cool.heres an idea for maple barley: sticky stuff; when he throws a bottle and a enemy steps on it,the enemy slows down.however, he deals 40% less damage.

Please stop dude, don't get yourself any lower

Mortis isnt that trash without his sp. Darryl is worse than mortis without it

Everybody say it is easy which is true. Just give me an extra 2 hours a day so i can push.

Yeah that is true! It‚Äòs easier to push brawler up to 500 trophies.‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
Wow that‚Äôs pretty cool
---
Yeah i have thought of it too, then they need more gems and star points for them
---
No you didn‚Äôt understand. I said I‚Äôm "playing with you" because I was joking all the time and you toke it seriously and you actually thought that I was serious too. All I want to say is that you‚Äôre to dumb to understand a joke

It's sad that you only get half of the star points of the brawlers trophies above 500 before the reset

Old poco was so good

Yes

Lmao same thing someone ripped off pam and its ur mom

Sure

Mortis gang, nice
---
Nop, only fingers. I don't have digital pen :')
---
not really, getting a new brawler to 500 gives you 600 points, so it‚Äôs still more worthwhile to push newer brawlers. not to mention that it‚Äôs easier to push brawlers to 500 than over 500, + only half the trophies are converted to star points each time
---
ok
---
Stop saying urself a pro, u kept on saying urself a pro since u r saying ‚Äòplaying with you‚Äô, if you faced the number 1 player in showdown from randoms, will you say that he is a noob?

Good job! I only use fingers too, it‚Äôs really hard but that‚Äôs what you gotta do untill you earn some money

I wanted to give credit to the creator of that Shelly fanart, but I couldn't find the post anymore.
---
Okay okay, I‚Äôm sorry. You‚Äôre art is really good and you deserve 1) a rest if you‚Äôre tired, 2) people‚Äôs apologies for assuming you were a thief, and 3) that even if these people think you‚Äôre a thief, you know deep down you worked hard on these and they are great! I am really sorry for assuming stuff that was not true.

I have no idea! I saw it on insta and it seemed pretty legit, so I posted it here

Well tommy should buy a floater so he can swim in this game

omg thx!

hehe - thanks HexagonalMelon!  appreciate the encouragement... i think i am improving as a player but if i‚Äôm being honest, i don‚Äôt know if i would have been skilled enough to get any Brawler to 500 trophies without the recent move to make it easier to procure trophies... i kinda feel like i don‚Äôt even deserve a 500 trophy brawler!

My parents speak Chinese, but you can‚Äôt straight translate el Machamp, so I did did as close as I could

He‚Äôs talking about the free tokens for rank 10,15 and 20. 100,200 and 300 tokens for them. So pushing all brawlers to only 500 will get you 600 for each. One time only. So 600 points times 27 brawlers.
---
lmao I did push, from 430 to 510 to get at least something

He's definitely not your dad as he would be tought you better than what you comment, you're comment history would've made him disappointed. This is a BrawlStars server not Smash so don't bring that game in here just to say it's better.

Wow that guy is almost 900 trophies üèÜ
---
I have not still received anything
---
10k+ is a joke.
---
Do you players still lose half their trophies when over 500+?
---
but he isn't, i pushed to 800 before trophy update, he's so strong in solo showdown
---
i have 14 and my opinion is: ^no
---
why, can any of them actually get close to people to use shotguns properly?
---
Yeah, glad this subreddit is like it is!
---
It's a repost :(

Oh no, he still has an innocent mind!! RETREAT!! ITS A TRAP

---
well, darryl's three shots deal more damage than both of them, but i'm pretty sure bull has more dps, and with his first star power active, it isn't even a question, but most of the time with shotgunners, the first three shots are the only ones that matter
---
Well it wasnt impossible, if you wanted to do something impossible try making 1 million twitch subs, robbing a national bank, starting a successful business. Not wasting ya life away on this game where theyll wipe away your work in a few balance changes for more trophy inflation
---
Thats cute!

Hell no, I shall call Satan to burn that subreddit..

Bruh. I'm sorry, but the internet will do it anyway. Are you TRYING to get rule 34'd???
---
you get star points only when you have have brawlers over 20. you also get for rank 10 and 15 but thats only one time not every season
---
Agree, they should give you star points compared with all the trophies you get adove 500 and then cut off 50%
---
And should add tickets, boxes and tokens doublers for star shop
---
Wow.
---
thank u@@@
---
Wait. That‚Äôs illegal
---
Old game piper !
---
"YOU FOOLS! I CAME TO WORK STRAPPED!"
---
you know that's almost 80 gems
---
Cool
---
I relate to that, I was one of the earlier people to play the game and introduced it to others after awhile. Now it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm the alpha of the school for brawl stars with 11.5k
---
So that's why his lamp goes inside his hat to knock some sense into him.
---
Im 15
---
Look at tjat ass, I LOVE IT
---
Oh yeah, 700 is just as easy. You just gotta play more and you‚Äôll push there with a mediocre winrate. I don‚Äôt even have nibbas at 800 so it wouldn‚Äôt even be a flex
---
How do u know lmaoo

Suuuuuure lmao

Its not okay to post art without credit or post an image that's from the same subreddit.

And remember to have proper **redditque~**

No dude, before the trophy update you were at 9k, you are a global player and you expect legendaries. f off

some of my classmates play bs

im desperately working towards 150 coins
---
Also, make an instagram.
---
This map isnt symmetrical, this can give one side an advantage over the other. Please fix that.
---
Dont use 1 block gaps (but if you fix the asymmetry then this will be fixed,  seeing how you just have to shift everything down a block). 1 block gaps cause movement issues
---
the joke is he didn't really get spike to rank 20 and he poorly photoshoped it.
---
yeah, I think the same, I dont like this new thing, I was waiting so good to the season to end, and then I get mas for that üòî
---
You dont NEED to keep drawing, but you seem to be good at it, so it might be worth your time

---
This is so cute
---
It isn't fair though!
---
Yes, I like this. A lot.
---
Ouch
---
Well I am mad. You didn't even ask before. Why did you do that in the first place anyway?
---
In my opinion all of this is good and I see only a few problems with 4 brawlers.
---
1. Carl:
---
Carl needs more movement speed to compensate for his decrease in power or a faster projectile because he would seem a little slow and crush in that sense. To simplify, he needs to either get his trick buffed or just fix his speed of throw.
---
2. Gene:
---
Gene no question needs a buff and a nerf because of his very low high of usage and underwhelming power when coming up on anti tanks or even brawler‚Äôs like colt. To compensate for that nerf they could make his reload speed .1 seconds faster to keep him on the useful side of things.
---
3. Tara:
---
Tara needs more of a buff than that. Listen, I know y‚Äôall might instantly comment on how Tara could be perfect but just hear me out. That nerf for the radius is a little extreme seeing the time it takes to deploy the tornado. 90% of all brawler‚Äôs in the game have a chance to run out of the radius of the tornado even if the player has a slow reaction time of 1.8 seconds. In my humble opinion you could do one of the following: 
---
  ‚Ä¢Change the radius to 3.8 from 4 with that buff you stated for Tara because the buff on damage doesn‚Äôt seem like much of a buff but rather a small touch up. Also, Tara is ranked C in power on average making her on the weak end anyways. Also, 3.8 tile radius will give the player about 1 second to react and move which is a very reasonable reaction time. 
---
  ‚Ä¢Do nothing but increase Tara‚Äôs speed and card damage from 532 to 552.
---
4. Penny
---
Penny I agree could do with a nerf but, that nerf seems a bit too much. For her super, I would keep it 4 from 6 instead of 3 because of their terrible accuracy on the barrage and it allows smooth reaction times of players.
---
What I thought was absolutely spot on on your changes and couldn‚Äôt have been better.
---
Piper: Agreed.
---
Jessie: has been a little useless for quite some time unless your teammates get hit. If you mean that only the initial projectile then perfect.
---
Shelly: Just *clap* beautiful. 
---
Brock: Should keep Piper as the true sniper with the slower reload and keep players in fair fighting areas.
---
BIBI: Main attack was superior to Mortis and this should give them each their pros now. Bubble did need some shrinking because of enclosed areas.
---
Home run change was spot on nothing bad about it but to avoid confusion, I would place it in between buff and nerf because knock-back can work for and against you.
---

I think a mega box in the future will cost 2500 so I'd say you a better reward
---
what is it?

Now he looks more like a superhero than a wrestler. I'd love to see a cartoon in this style!

I personally have all my brawlers at about rank 15 but i think this would be good.
---
OooOOoOoooo!!!!!
---
Well, yes I did üòÖ. Dynamikes super seems way stronger and is easier to land
---
Not gamechanging? It literally allows Darryl to roll into and assassinate brawlers who excel at close combat, which he could do without his star power but only if he makes sure they're distracted or out of ammo.
---
With the star power he could just roll in their face and kill them even if they're not out of ammo. Because Darryl's attacks take so long to execute, the shield allows him to survive long enough to actually use all of his ammo in direct combat.
---
Were you the El Primo or Crow that got destroyed? ü§™

‚ÄúEndgame content‚Äù took the devs 2 fucking years to add in and none of us endgame players were whining as much as you when every single update was made for casual and low trophy players such as yourself. Stop acting like an entitled brat, this change wasn‚Äôt meant for you, so you can stop crying it. You‚Äôre losing 4 brawl boxes every 2 weeks, get over it. You make more in 1 game of robo rumble.

Mortis is gettin' da ladies!
---
I'm 11k with 0 legendaries.
---
Yh they could do the map like a gem grab map but two times wider and two time longer
---
I tried so many times and I could never get it to work
---
Supercell if you want me to help u design a map for the new mode my bs name is SW4MP
---
Boiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
---
My dad left me
---
Right? Anyone who thinks el primos model is good has bad vision. It‚Äôs by far the lowest quality model of every character. The animations are great, don‚Äôt get me wrong, but damn is the model ugly. 
---
It‚Äôs one of those things where if you eat trash all your life you‚Äôll think trash tastes pretty good, it‚Äôs not until you get a taste of good food will you know it was shit.
---
Jaja thanks
---

El Primo looks just fineee

Or the bat is just bigger than a regular bat, and your whole theory is wrong ):
---
Yes It wont the r with capital letter
---
Bruh, that‚Äôs the point of the template.
---
.... but that was literally 2 straight shots....
---
im 6.3k and i need gene and all legendaries
---
theres a humor tag for a reason guys plz dont take this or anything i do seriously
---
It‚Äôs going to be too easy to get brawlers then. By now most people are 10000 or near it and the reason Brawl Stars almost died was because you could easily get brawlers. Heck, spend $25 in beta and you maxed out your account. Making it easier to get brawlers would probably make endgame less fun and less players.
---
Gedi kor doesn‚Äôt need more appreciation.
---
Ssssshhhhhhh
---
I did the math and there is a 0.0675% chance of this, which is also my legendary chances.
---
When someone says Shelly need a nerf, you know he doesn't know anything about the game. Keep crying kid, they won't buff him as he is in a nice spot now
---
r/foundtheuser
---
Zakon Frendici but on Croatian
---
This would make brawl stars skin to win. Which would be terrible.
---
Bruh
---
I‚Äôm going to be brutally honest with you, and no offense, but there was nothing ‚Äúpro‚Äù about that. It‚Äôs what everyone expects a decent teammate to do.
---
Sooooo...
---
The best strategy in showdown is to camp in a bush and when u see someone fighting, u just 3-rd party them and u win.
---
Damn so sad drawing :(
---
Use day mode when its day
---
OR 
---
Press your name on your comment &gt; change user flair 
---

Ni√±o, no puedes publicar en espa√±ol. Adem√°s, vaya mierda de meme, mejor deja Reddit y vete a Facebook o YouTube donde ni√±os como t√∫ pertenecen

Mortises star power does make a diffrence lol, its one of the best in the game.
---
r/sinkbotit

---
Omg no one ever disagreed with that. 
---
And to be fair if you are stuck at 300 trophies with a lvl 10, I‚Äôll beat the dog shit outta ya with lvl 1 brawlers. Because the truth would be that I am ‚Äústronger‚Äù, regardless of power lvl. 
---
Go complain elsewhere now.
---
The eagle on his head is high
---
this is literally pay to win why not just more star powers lol
---
Me and the boys rush Area 51
---
No, I say 0=2 when talking of star points

What essence?  He‚Äôs a god damn cactus.

I have 2 friends that I introduced that way. I'm actually in a pretty good club where about 6 people are always online, but only 2 of them accept my invite. &gt;!yobama&lt;!

Wonderful insight
---
You‚Äôre wrong, but it would be wrong of me to give a downvote since you‚Äôve already accepted it and handled it well. Imma hit you with a upvote, I‚Äôm not gonna be toxic ‚¨ÜÔ∏è

Sadly pretty much the whole sub is at the age where they think 69 jokes are hilarious
---
No problem, glad I helped you. You deserve a pass because you did the monster math :)
---
Amazing art!!!
---
lit
---
Fortnite mobile has auto aim. Also that game feels like shit.
---
I play Brawl and Geo Dash
---
I love this game better than fortnite I just wished they had a season and season pass along with trophy road.
---
Lol it‚Äôs like this. We are never in the same clubs.
---
Me up here (10k+)
---
Another friend here (8k)
---
A little bit here (3k to 5k)
---
Everyone else down here (Less than 1k)
---
Yeah you have at least one brawler with his star power and all your brawlers seem balanced in level.
---
genek or shrene
---
I am not even 6k and I dont have only Leon. Guess I am lucky.
---
he stole my meme
---
in my 4 reply I mention them but I never complain on them
---
My teacher was on it once
---
Even a bear plays better than me
---
I'm at 14k and I would rather the boxes.
---
You were complaining about how they were replaced
---
Idk, I‚Äôve seen plenty of it. Second comment in this very thread:
---
&gt; If supercell doesn't add something other than skins for star points, star points will prove their uselessness
---
Hahaha funny cus dynamike teams haha ecks dee lmao üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
it's easy because you're playing with people who downloaded the game yesterday.
---
It just draws a lot of that look.
---
Nothing happened.
---
Thx!!!

Looks great! üç≠üç≠üç≠
---
issa joke. :P only maxed out people like this change. I'd prefer free brawl boxes
---
ooh true I complain about how they removed but whats the problem with that?? I think almost everyone get dissapointed just ask üßê
---
at least it's honest. if my emails looked like that, I'd hope someone would correct me
---
You will pay for it .
---
Stop playing close range brawlers in bounty if it‚Äôs not snake prarie
---
That's not mecha crow! lmaoüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
He's a creature at night
---
*sigh*, adults can laugh at that because they know what reference its from. Thats humour, BUT THERES MULTIPLE KINDS OF HUMOUR! HOW IGNORANT CAN YOU BE?? Even elon musk, someone we all know very well through his companies and MEMES ( ahem also a type of humour) EVEN HE USES HIS HUMOUR TO HAVE FUN. Humour makes people laugh. If theres no humour, the world will be filled with people like you not learning how to love and such. So yeah, i believe that humour can also be immature. So what?
---
Haha
---
Same . Missing all the legendaries .
---
Guys I used a template that had the credits for the original creator
---

---
literally every social Media was his dead, FOR A WEEK

It was only 5 years ago.
---
Simple coins -&gt; to gems and skins on the road as well similar to the emotes on the trophy road of clash Royale
---
Awesome arts
---
Making fun of ppl that post the same thing as the whole community hahaahahaa
---
Ganging up on a person with higher power cubes at the end of the game is a valid strategy, I do it sometimes. Also, teaming isn‚Äôt a bannable offence, which sucks.
