Yeah sorry I tried to blend in the face to have it fading into the shadows but the markers are crap and tear up the paper if I try to blend it.
---
We could make them all super rares, they arent hard to get and they can balance the other rarities out. 
---
Other ideas could be having a greater luck increment, or grouping rares + super rares into a rarity, epics + mythic into one, and keep legendary. I feel like there are too much rarities to have, and there is no luck getting them.

They did it already though lol. The reason it was so high in the first place was for the exact same reason. They got a heap of people to stream it for exposure.

Yeah, i understand your point, but this response doesnt really fit in.

Wonderbrad and being bad

I'm 5.5k trophies now. Only missing Spike, Leon, and Bibi. Mortis is my first lvl 9. He'll be my first star power.
---
Jk

Yes the guy who said ryan will never comeback is saying something true but he wants him to comeback from his inside the old guy just looks rude for doing that the template should be old guy punching a rude guy not old guy being rude
---
This is really good art. Can you give me any advice to get better?
---
😐
---
Lol wut
---
I hope this gets into Coach Cory's top plays video because this is hilarious to watch the barley cost the game so many times and had so many chances but he had to spin. Then, the bull spun on him in the end!
---
with the way supercell have done the rewards system, as soon as you tap the box all the rewards are decided immediately, then they are revealed one by one when you tap. I think this may be of you crash or close the game while opening the box you don't lose rewards
---
Word. I have about 270 the key is to just not buy everything on a whim. I've bought probably 2 multipliers with the deal and 2 160 points with deal. Just gotta save. And i got 22/26 characters. F2p is the way baybay

I tried poco too earlier and push him to rank 16.

He’s really good with the energy drink, otherwise he’s not that good. with the energy drink you can run to a clump of players and quickly take them all out by spamming a few shots. No aiming, no short range. Perfect.
---
Is it THAT HARD to win 4 times everyday??? Might as well not play lmao.
---
You profit 1 gem! That's a steal!
---
This will probably happen to me too...
---
Nobody ever said it was hard or not idiot lmfao. Some people don’t want to play other game modes, and some casual players only want to hop on a few times a day for a game of showdown or something

Stream snipe Ninja, only target him, spin on him, win, post the video to YT and on here and I will watch, and like

Allowing the players to alter their matchmaking is not a good idea. However, I agree. Maybe even just hiding the fact that you are on brawl TV.

Change ryan will never comeback in brawl talks to ryan should never comeback in brawl talks

I apologize if I repeated their post. I would be set if I could control my character with my right thumb and attack with my left.

Nice low effort post btw

A Gem in  Time!

I mean since the game was in 1.0 there was the auto save feature, or even back in beta 1.8, idk

You got alot of brawlers d lah

Would it have been better to put a hat on Mortis?🤔
---
Anyway, thanks you for the compliment!😊😊

Lmao I was just making a meme out of the situation.

I still disagree. Ill still make it WAY to easy to progress. Its already the most F2P supercell game.

no you haven't. this is pretty original.

bottom right?

Where star player loses less or loses no trophies? No one has seen this before?

I wish I could get one because this is my favorite Barley skin but I missed the streams.

Then i dont know, atleast you got free skin

*so this is the power of ultra instinct?*

I see. I think someone should make a scale of how hard they freak out.
---
El Libtard Primo
---
Yes but what if they finish with a super?
---
I have crow but I haven't really noticed any changes besides move speed but I dont know if spinning around is included in "move speed" I imagine it would though because spinning around 180 degrees is technically movement.
---
New Animation Video When?
---
But it also shows it's kind of a desperation tactic. Supercell has the money to entice streamers. Doesn't mean this game is going to have longevity like clash royale
---
I'm really sorry, but it's just that... something seems off.

I got mine at 3k and my no-life friendo got his at 1k

WRONG you didnt comment that in sakurai spike fanart.

Y'all lucky af it took me until 7k
---
I remembered when I first got Tara, I played her in bounty and literally became gene, bushcamping and pulling people to me
---
Ok
---
If you spin you show youre trammate he or the team did something great and you shoot to show the other one should go thats what I have learned
---
My dude just saying you’re at 3k with 22 brawlers u should be higher
---
That is what I was doing lmao I missed my Super so many times with her but I will get better.

I actually made a meme about changing Primo's name to Gem Delivery Service way before this one.

---
I was excited when I got 3
---
Fake. The offer to buy 169 gems with 170 is the real one.
---
Those are used during the game right?
---
My signals are used the second the game started
---
Haha that spinner barley😂😂😂,got what he deserves just for celebrating early victory.
---
Imagine the primo with 10 gems that jumped to the other team gets star player
---
Buy token doublers, dont spend them for skins they are useless for f2p

Yep, it's a healthy chunk of top streamers income.

Sorry for the repost but the other one didn't show my picture of the map

Usually if you're inflicting a lot of damage you're doing something right anyways

We'll that's just goddamn right

The gene did pretty well, it's just that barley and shelly were extremely toxic
---
i was in brawl tv once and it has only 2 people and i got second place
---
Just. Stop.
---
Im sorry but I couldn't understand, can someone evaluate in simple easy words?
---
I'll take that as a compliment :') Thank you! If you also love drawing like me, just keep practicing :D

I mean shellys super is op and annoying as shit, but every brawler has to have his counters, so does mortis...right?

that barley was total dumbass

This is the reason why I don't BM unless  im in a duo match

So the losing team has a star player too, the star player on the losing team loses less trophies.

Hey Brawlers, Shelly here.
---
This post is funny because gene gives a dude a wish. He gives three rules, but the person asks for Rosa to be returned to her normal state before the Nerf. Because as we all know, Rosa was broken before the nerfs and that is why the gene added on another wish to prevent that from happening.
---
Thanks, Shelly Out!

But then no one will have a team mindset, everyone will be playing only to get that award

I was saving up for it then when saw that discount I was like this is perfect

Yea. I agree.
---
Sometimes teaming just happens in a threeway-fight. But thats not really teaming, I think.

But agree. The amount of reports needed to actually ban a player, should be high enough to make sure that he is doing the spinny spin-teaming and is doing it in more than just one game.

Not sure if enjoyable is the right word for the trophysystem.

"Pro"-player for example play like 8 hours a day and if they lose once they get thrown back for a hour or so. Not sure whats enjoyable about this. but you do you.

Only if you like Mortis. I’ve got him to 500 and shelved him like a bad bag of beans. I ain’t ever touching him again. No buff or rework is going to change how he plays. He works well in very minute situations with very good back up.

He throws balls of lava,

Why does it matter? The game was ending

I was confused to. It would have been better if they said 90 + 4.5 + 4.5 or something like that
---
I KNEW
---
there’s literally nothing insane about this any mediocre mortis player can do this against people that auto-aim
---
Same for me, I could upgrade almost all of my brawlers to max if I had the coins
---
Bruh
---
Oh SHOOT!!! I forgot 😩
---
You kiss your mother with that mouth?
---
I don’t get it
---
But then again it is still gacha BrawlStars doesn’t count on this hell of an app
---
I’m actually fine with this. Supercell is marketing the game to new players. That also probably means there is about to be a big update soon. This is all 100% a good thing, even if you don’t like Ninja like me. Some people are too focused on the fact that Ninja is playing, but they can’t see all the positive effects of him playing.
---
But the star player isn’t always accurate. If I’m a crow who’s picking off enemies and slowly draining their health in bounty I might be doing the most work, but chances are the bull that charges at the enemies and gets a few killed but dies 10 times will.
---
You’ve obviously never played clash royale. It takes thousands of dollars to max
---
r/mortisgang approves
---
REEEEEE POST
---
The fact you even ask that question is just... oy. Spinning is the equivalent of t-bagging on brawl stars. Which yes is toxic. its bragging and unecessary
---
 If compared to physical sports its the equivalent of poor sportsmanship. Yeah you can do it. Should you? Very debateable. 
---
Seriously you even said its reasoning for being toxic yourself. "Assertion of dominance" so just oy...

It's definitely not a wifi issue. The issue vanishes right after the match ends, and even restarting the game during the match has no effect.

Hey! but you noticed it (HOORAY!!🍩)
---
Not as bad as me losing 34 siege battles in a row, lost 252 trophies. I feel sorry for you, hope you recover those trophies
---
I feel like there should be more walls around, just so that you don't end up with a 4 way piper team
---
Uhuh like i said just because you can doesnt mean you should. Its trashy. Also how the heck did you come up with the idea that its similiar to running across the field in soccer? Like wot? No. Im sorry but just no. Honestly to you it may be perceived that way but to others it may be perceived as a boxer calling laughing at you.after he won just the first round. Im well aware they do that and yeah its not toxic(running across the field) Spinning in this game especially in showdown where you cant retaliate is the issue. Or spinning as is the case of this barley and the shelly is toxic. Hell it litterally cost them the game. As for the comparison its not idiotic. It rings true. Its a method of showing your dominance as you litterally said. Oy im a be completely honest here. This arguement is going to go no where. Based om your response alone i can see why youd pervceive it as nontoxic. Which also made me realize something. To some it wont seem toxic but to others its toxic as hell. So good on you ig. spinning is situational and im sure many would perceive it differently as we do. Also your example of bull spinning doesnt count since theyd just won after all that work. Hell half your examples didnt. Im talking about what the barley did and how he did it. Celebrating is fine doing so prematurely or just doing so knowing full well theres no way for the enemy team you just spun on to get another chance is my issue and why i perceive it as very toxic. As i said do what you wish. But in my eyes and apparently quite a few others its an annoying d-move.  Oy my head hurts with this entire conversation. So lets just agree to disagree this ig.
---
the origin of their lines xD
---
The screen shot literally encourages auto aim.
---
Hiw the hell do you report?
---
I hope supercell will add this, but very cool map
---
Battlenet
---
The games not dying. They listen to the community. It takes time dipshit. Not their fault most people don’t enjoy siege(which I do). They can’t do everything in one month

It used to be possible when the game first came out and now it isn’t

If you click on the message a user send in your band you can choose to view their profile or report them.

I swear to God if ninja gets the ability to ban people for stream sniping....... I am going to lose my shit. I am not sad that he is bringing new people to brawl stars, but if he gets the power that he has in fortnite in brawlstars......

Oh okay

---
I didnt complain lol. Merely made a point about the above video. As i stated before perception changes many things. And depending on the situation im fine with it. But doing it as in the case of this vid which is what this all is about, is toxic as hell. Sorry not sorry. Its quite clear i shouldnt of used comparisons its clearly misplaced my point entirely.

ULTRA INSTINCT MORTIS

What!

Boom box brock rockabilly mortis and panda nita (even tho i hate nita)

"carries your ass in brawl ball" why is this so true,,,

I don't fit this starter pack, I'm unique

He asked what that meant, not 中国的东西
---
Mate my friend who just started got a spike on his 4th box, he was under 1k trophies
---
And he sucks
---
Just gonna say that it's a really nooby point that you claim qualifies you as "good as brawl ball" and everyone else as "bad"
---
&lt;shrug&gt;
---
I knew that from the beginning xd
---
It will be a new skin for you to use. How you all cant umderstand this UGH. I wonder if there is someone that really understand it.
---
Hmm... Yep,a really good idea
---
Nice!
---
Yeah, unfortunately I don't have many gems so I'm just wondering if it's worth it lol
---
Myb for not including a tldr in there
---
TLDR:
---
Brawl Ball is about positioning the ball. No matter how many one-on-ones you win, if the enemy repositions the ball in their favor, they win more than you.
---
It is
---
That was decent
---
The map isn't symmetrical, some players get 3 boxes in their section while others get only 2 and there are too many bushes.
---
I guess they never miss or always miss when playing the epic raruty brawler from a free to play game brawl stars available on android play store and ios app store, huh?
---
Intense
---
Ultra instict mode: ON
---
Yeah most of his skins don't fit the game imo

---
Yeah like a star loser
---
Any name in general accompanied with random numbers (usually their birth year ;) works oOF
---
How to use ?
---
So even if he does learn it he would be very inexperienced
---
Why humour though?
---
Agreed. I can’t blame Gedi for this. It’s just that people (especially on the sub) like to follow trends, like El Primo w/10 gems and stuff like that.
---
Wow that’s actually kinda sad... i’ve played for 6 months and all I don’t have are the legendaries
---
yeah it really just depends on how many boxes you’ve opened. chances to pull a new one go up after each box without a new brawler.
---
"Primarily through siege" Hmm...
---
Inb4 the awards
---
Still great nonetheless! I also love how you alluded to Jessie’s own summer skin!
---
Maybe you are a gemmer
---
you must be playing alot of melee tgen, lmao, that feel when your primo gets squashed on a by some invisbleml man with 2000+ attack damage up close, R.I.P
---
Golden Sniper Bot + Energy Drink... O_o
---
Aloha
---
Anyone see bibi ?
---
Your skills need a buff. Learn how to play him and he is balanced
---
Good art, bad idea.
---
#bringbacklifeleach #stopthespin XD XD.... yeah basically
---
Show a clip as proof
---
Don’t give us a legendary
---
Lol i have the same feeling no gold and a lot of leveling up
---
Cringe 100
---
Exactly
---
Your post has been removed, make sure to use the body of a post to elaborate on the title.
---
*Coach* gag
---
Is mortis unhittable now?
---
What bothsrs me even more is that rico is staring right at it,,,
---
the matrix remastered
---
I know just kidding😁
---
In English,there is always an h in the end of sounds that end on a vowel. I dont know why it is like that (I don't live in an English speaking country and I am not erican,British,Australian etc.).I don't know other languages that do that.
---
Whoa so cute! This skin puts me in a summer mood!
---
My idea:
---
This will be a new legendary brawler, a “cat brawler” called “Felix”.
---
Why this name?
---
Well, “Felis silvestris” means cat in latin, and Felix is a common name for a cat.
---
Don't forget that one in every 3 games has someone with the name "Kevin"
---
You forgot those: Name + Year of birth (often 2005/2006)
---
Where Ricoshet and Darryl.
---
Nice.... penis death
---
Damn that girl is hot as hell
---
What do you mean "bad idea" I think its a really good idea!
---
Is this a troll? So basically EVERYONE was saying they hate siege, dont like it at all, just losing trophies bla bla bla..but now when someone else says that noone likes siege, then eveyone in the comments is like I lOvE SiEgE, like wth is this a troll????
---
Though I won't be applying for moderator because I simply do not have enough time on my hands, I would like to thank you for improving the quality of the sub. 
---
Keep being awesome!
---
5% Because not only Bull Camps in bushes. Rosa, El primo and other high damage brawlers camp a lot. Like i got killed by that method that many times i punched my phone
---
This could be good as people who watch him will start playing and this game would grow but they may also just bring toxic 12 year olds from fortnight to the game
---
That poco one is Hella accurate
---
Keep up the awesome work! Don’t let those art stealers get you down.
---
Drop the music 🎶
---
You are hungary??
---
Thank you :)
---
I have no doubt in my mind that you guys try your hardest to make this sub fun and as non-toxic as possible, but there were still some pretty unfair bans imo.
---
All of these are 100% accurate
---
GG
---
This is good with Gene
---
Gone, reduced to atoms.
---
Lol I’ve been trying to win as mortis in showdown and every time I get to the last 2 this happens and I always die
---
I love these
---
Wow really professional map!  I really liked, I also create maps, you can check them on my profile, and say an opinion
---
"Da' is "yes" on russian lmao :D
---
I'm Russian
---
Russians also enjoys hentai :3
---
Updoot
---
Im 600 trophies with Mortis. He is definitely on the weaker side of all the Brawlers and could use a buff IMO.
---
Piper has joined the chat
---
Yh
---
nah, I love him because he is hard to play, but thy gotta make him rewarding to master, like Rico, hard to play but once u master him get ready to demolish teams by yourself (ik because I used to main him before I got mortis and that is what I do)
---
I don’t know how he’s going to hold his guitar but it’s a nice skin
---
That doesn’t mean crow is getting a remodel, lol
---
Loved this drawing😍💖
---
Im not having this problem, if i miss, its because i aimed badly
---
The damn screaming 😹
---
That's cool!
---
Extra thicc shot
---
buff mortis
---
So piper, tara, and Bo doesn’t need one?
---
Un poco loco, un poquitito loco
---
I don’t recon gene needs a nerf. He takes a lot of time to recharge his attacks. But I agree with Rosa and Carl
---
I only have crow
---
Gene is perhaps the strongest brawler right now. It’s between him and Carl.
---
His ability to drag people through walls and his ridiculous range and poke damage potential is what makes him so strong
---
These skins are on fire
---
Wow you say more bad words than me, I appreciate that
---
When you feel yourself guilty because you have spike ;-;
---
Uhh... *surprised pikachuface
---
Dead
---
His attack should be a wave of water instead of sound
---
K then. A new brawler with a sparky- like turret could be cool, though, couldn't it?
---
And this is why I need a new brawler...
---
Hol up
---
I felt like he fires too fast between his shots, if that can be nerfed to like 0.5sec between shots, I wouldn’t mind buffing his damage
---
Poco is having fun atleast outside of the game.
---
*plays my sweet lord*
---
Brock, Bo and Bibi in the Background xD
---
What can I say? OOF
---
I really hate Rosa.  No thought, just rush when your close and hide the rest of the time.
---
how is this related to brawl stars?
---
Who won?
---
I’m sure we are. That’s why we vet them and make sure we choose the right people.
---
Your dad should have used a condom
---
r/lostredditors
---
When you can watch YouTube in HD but can’t play a brawlstars game that isn’t laggy
---
nope who plays el primo
---
no lol you can't compare a battle Royale and completely different game
---
Yes, you did good fellow brawler.
---
I like your nerve putting free to use in the title thats cute
---
But a StrEAmEr SaiD hE nEEds a bUff
---
Ty
---
Yes you can its gonna be pretty good to put on youtube
---
Great, thanks uwu
---
If you want supercell to take action at least include player tag. The name is useless and without the tag it’s basically a spam post
---
Let me guess, year 1970 ?
---
[killah chameLeon]
---
Your skins are really doing phenomenal develop, surely getting better! You need to collaborate with someone.
---
well how do i play him like? like piper? Hell no he's a (CLOSE RANGE) brawler not a healer or a long range brawler. I think you're saying that because you are getting killed by mortis or you dont have him. Plus I pushed mortis this season to 728 and hes the hardest to push like poco and piper.
---
Not sure...I def notice it on the knockback as well but haven't noticed any pattern. That's not to say there isn't one, I just haven't payed very close attention.
---
meanwhile: a picture of Crow, Bull and BiBi pulling a heist because theyre in the same gang
---
Poco loco: #BEHIND THE SCENES
---
No I see you guys running into shellys with super all the time like ur frikin one punch man
---
Its not about game tag, someone already wrote to their support reporting some other player (with game tag and everything) and they replied something like: sorry but we cant ban him, its his chose to play like this, read our terms and conditions, there are nothing about how you should play. So including player tag is useless anyway.
---
Ooooh, did you mean the Rico's that can't hit their shots? If so, r/woooosh on me
---
ok
---
r/woooosh
---
Press x to doubt
---
Completely forgot
---
piper is actually good in brawl ball (obviusly in the correct map)
---
piper, brock and bo is more like hunters than bibi
---
Bold of you to assume I'm decent
---
Shurikens look like swastikas
---
Isn't it GEDI-KOR?
---
Oh and I mean comments
---
They bpught him in the shop with yesterdays deal
---
Yeah whoops
---
Even I, your friendly neighborhood barley main, do not approve.
---
My idea of ​​a new brawler that he is a ninja that gives 400 damage per shuriken he has 5000 life and his special is to loose a lot of shuriken around him so anyone who is near him will teleport to attack the rarity It's going to be legendary and his special of 500 damage per shuriken.
---
what if she threw a "glitch bomb" that randomly switched teammates and enemy s main attacks for 4 seconts
---
Not a ~clan~club, just a gang. I'm vice president of my club, but in both r/Jessiegang and r/nolegendarygang.
---
Nice
---
But the Mortis didn't attack anything
---
Lmfao
---
I am satified
---
thats me with barley
---
Nah, they are Free to play players, they barely have 50 gems
---
Are you assuming I'm a kid stupid mortis?
---
What happens if you claim them all?
---
Why have you not unfriended him
---
too big
---
like my pp
---
excuse me wtf
---
yeah, cool play, but you shouldnt spin when you pester someone and when they decide to fight back you kill them
---
Thank you. Now I will shoot enemies with my shovel instead of slicing them. I appreciate your quality advice
---
Oh (also they BARLEY have 50 gems
---
*intensely tapping phone screen*
---
If you are mortis gang than what are you even doing on MY post? I kill the mortis not work with it
---
Yes, #stopthespin
---
Well done, u a genius
---
I am close to 1.9k trophies and I have 16 Brawlers. All rares, all super rares and 2 epics.. :/
---
Then why would he repost u/SwordAz_
---
What can he assume? Ur at 4k and lecture him about using Mortis
---
I know i mean i am a tara main afterall
---
I feel attacked
---
I don't exactly know how I'm doing that
---
James
---
Well if you hate this game and subreddit so much then why do you keep coming back to this sub?
---
it took me 6 months
---
Everybody has to start somewhere.
---
😂😂😂
---
This map would be unplayable. Brawlers can’t fit through 1x1 spaces.
---
Poco is balanced why are you complaining?
---
But crow needed a buff. He was so frustrating to use. His poison doesn’t  stack so he was doing only like 300 damage a shot thus making his super useless against anyone but ranged brawlers. Even then ranged brawlers all could 2 shot him (and still can) which made his regular attack useless against them.
---
My recommendation: don’t. If you buy a big box for 30 gems, you are spending 10 gems a box. Would you really ever pay 10 gems a box?
---
Xseriooo
---
Dies instantly after running into a Bush where bull was hidding
---
#seeeeriooo
---
Lwarb be like
---
What'cha doin' Bull?? 😏
---
Yeah I’d do that
---
im not i think he ia balanced right now but every body wants him to get buffed
---
*The Legends we're real all along*
---
For those who don't know what did I want to say with this... 
---
While Making this, I had a story in my mind which freaked me out. It follows like this.
---
Bibi is chilling in the bull's diner, while a portal from nowhere opens from where comes mortis from another universe... A universe where he took out everyone except one. I did actually put an Easter egg kind of hint on the cross on mortis side...
---
Freddy Fazbear: Balloon Boy is that you?
---
Ah mines 9 been waiting weeks now for his star power. anyway i didnt and atill dont think he needs a damage buff. i thought he needed a health buff though...
---
mahn don't do him like that 😂😂
---
Feelsbadman
---
I mean people always spin on Poco whenever they kill him and I think it’s about time Poco took the throne
---
aw, why tho dood?
---
I love this 😂😂😂😂😂😂
---
He is a healer kinda like a medic in battlefield: stay back heal others annoy enemies since his range is not bad at all and he is dominant against low hp brawlers(but hey let's be honest supercell sucks at making a better meta and that just makes the game less fun and more crappy)
---
*He existed in myth, in legend! but nobody expectes him to be real all along...*
---
Why exactly *69*
---
The one tile openings in the middle 😥
---
Other than that, great map!
---
I understand it’s a little more data to record, but you can’t justify supercell. Maybe under 400 trophies you have a certain time to replay. This will keep their servers from having too much data if that’s what they’re worried about.
---
As I waste all my tickets...
---
r/Unexpectedteamrocket
---
am at 5000 trophes and i still dont have frank , piper ,bibi and more ! ( F2P )
---
Probably by drawing but maybe you can't
---
^(you are makin´ me a) 
---
|*poco loco*|^(el primo)|an unknown language who makes someone say ´´loco´´|

---
|heal when i die|***B***|a buffed leon|
---
Agreed. It's the rewards are trash compared to Robo Rumble.
---
Its everyday
---
It's going to be a cat and human hybrid that spits out hair balls
---
So... what you are saying is that we won?
---
His damage was way too low before. Everyone always made the argument that the poison increases it but poison doesn’t stack so it only applies on the first shot. After that you were doing less than 300 per shot unless you got within range to get 2 daggers to hit, but in order to do that you had to get within auto-aim range so you’d get 2 shot by almost any brawler.
---
A health buff would have been useless because he would still only survive 2 shots at most (3 to kill) from most brawlers thus making his super still useless.
---
IMO, the only thing that I would have liked to see other than a damage buff is reworking him by either adding a dagger so you could hit someone with 2 daggers from max range or making the poison stack (not both though).
---
Even now though I still rarely die from crows, especially when I’m playing as a ranged brawler. He’s definitely good but he’s in no way OP. Annoying at most.
---
I wish the game is still like that:no rosa, every one had a huge range,no Leon,getting an epic was a huge deal, Darryl was a big Boi, ricochet was not thicccccccccccc and had reload animation, no lag.... My God ate they killing their own game?
---
That watermark ruins it... Nobody elses meme remake art has their watermark....
---
I do it on my mini. Otherwise I just save my tickets for RR and Boss Fight.
---
Hi
---
Nice skin idea
---
They deserved that. Spinning NEAR their goal.
---
69 tho.
---
Unfortunately I know where that’s from.
---
Bull: imma turn Mortis into Mort*was* lmao
---
Mortis: not today bih
---
I am a bad Spike player
---
y e s
---
Waah that sucks !
---
True, those noobs who said Mortis needs a damage buff just want Mortis to be able to 3 shot Bull... Mortis doesn’t need a damage, range or reload speed buff he just needed to be used better... you can check bushes if you have brain cells
---
to darryl a surf board) i love this it would nice with summer jesse
---
Nice artwork!
---
But is the lollipop safe to eat???
---
Now his looks can match his voice
---
Stretched
---
Well just want to tell you. Ninja is a famous twitch fortnite streamer. Hes known for being good at it.
---
Unless there is a wall that’s when you can check the bushes but if there isn’t you can’t really.
---
That's super impressive
---
If you noob why not
---
“Hear me, my caretaker who is a woman, for I require your assistance”
---
Seriously, if there is a wall, many other brawlers cany check the bush too XD Players who said buff Mortis are either in Mortis Gang or they basically suck
---
why lol?
---
Thanks- I did kind of gather that, never paid much attention to Fortnite so I guess that’s why I’ve never heard of him.
---
She breathes through the eye hole.
---
you know, i'm kind of russianese myself.
---
That is lit 😍
---
watch out for leons
---
We meet again...
