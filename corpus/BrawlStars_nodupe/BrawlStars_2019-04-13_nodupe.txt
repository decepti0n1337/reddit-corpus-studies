What trophy count are you?

But he has 1000
---
Or like a video to explain
---
but how do carl's clothes fit Frank? Hmmmmm...either Frank is actually smaller, Carl is bigger, or both.
---
&amp;#x200B;

I think both.
---
Valanced, omg. Learn to write
---
Are you sure your teammates are also playing aggro when you do that?

Maybe he can bribe supercell for a *pam nerf*
---
Were his peg leg

How does one do that? Like, what mod or whatever was downloaded?
---
You wanna link?

We can see the footprints in front of you, I‚Äôm not as retarded as everyone else here obviously...

Yes please

how many times have you won a 1 vs 1 vs 8?

not being the 8

its true

yes, that one was the BEST

at least give us kaboom cannon again supercell

But just because they are both thrpwers doesnt make them not unique. Barley has a unique super, his shots stick around for a while and his attacks heal him. Dynamike can jump with his attacks, has a different super, and his attacks go off sooner or later depending on where they are thrown. Even if they were the same level of uniqueness, they are different rarities so by your logic barley should be more unique than dynamike.
---
Is this private server
---
Will good luck
---
37k now
---
No idea, but I would say it doesn't hurt to try to contact customer support and see.
---
Worst case scenario, you are stuck with the skin, which you already are. Might as well try.
---
Its worth it in my opinion, but you should probably spend them on tickets if skins if you don‚Äôt really care about skins.
---
But still, phoenix crow is the best skin in the game, especially with an 81 gem discount
---
Oh, how innocent. Do not let this being learn the horrible ways.
---
He‚Äôs like second or third behind pam and leon
---
They deal less damage so they break them slower.
---
Piper is especially bad since she has to be far away to deal max damage, which makes it easy for people to steal the power-up after you break the box.
---
There‚Äôs that one laugh she does that drives me nuts.
---
There's a kind of hamster or something like that in her shoulder (In the drawing)
---
That's very cool man, could  be a Nota from the  caves!!!
---
Yeah he is just a salty dude, looking for attention.
---
Lol he's still black

I can tell

For the brief moment life leach was around, i struggled a lot cause i usually go for the survivalist strategy when playing SD instead of a more aggressive one which this gamemode recommend. I won't mind it coming back tho, it may be tough but it's fun
---
As someone who's subscribed to both subreddits, i didn't realize the crossover art or whatever it is called.
---
Good job mate
---
reminder that mortis isn't actually a vampire but is very vampire like
---
We found the real Kim jong un
---
Me too. It was for a time available to play with bots, but now they removed it even from there. I heard it was because of massive teaming, but anyways it was a good and funny to play map, yes
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHA, oww, so cute, what I said really hurt you, so funny
---
Lmao
---
Teames be like
---
mmm
---
Nah, I‚Äôm saving my gems for good seasonal skin or something really cool. I don‚Äôt see the value in Phoenix Crow, but I admit he is cool.
---
I kind of like this feature since it can be used in a lot of different ways in high level gameplay, but I also think it should be removed because it gives long range brawlers way too big of an advantage against short range brawlers who rely on walls, being able to pressure corners like this makes a 2 tile wide wall feel a lot more like 1 tile wide, if this was fixed we wouldn‚Äôt need to have nearly as many bushes and walls on some maps since tanks will be able to perform just fine with a moderate amount.
---
Crunched some numbers...
---
Average growth rate: 8.5 / Minute
---
Current sub: 963 913
---
Target sub: 1 000 000
---
8.5x/minutes = 1000000 - 963913
---
x = 36087 minutes/8.5

x = 2.94 days

u just suck lol

Ahhhhhhhh, if this true, then it should come out on monday

Student of el primo and Shelly's t h I c c relative dons a pair of wild spikes for boxing gloves
---
Good that you actually credit people now. Nice art
---
To be honest I would spend money on that skin
---
And I‚Äôm over here missing boxes, you do you
---
I was started a  gem grab and the game froze and took a while to finally load. When I came back my bot was carrying 7 gems and my team was in countdown. I ended up winning. I watched the replay after, it was funny
---
What do I subscribe on?
---
el primo remodel !!!!!
---
It fits the whole theme of the event though. Like brawl ball maps are all boxes or the wood fencing thrown on the field it‚Äôs like a very... I can‚Äôt think of the word but a very ____ design and the ball fits in with that design.
---
I got gene Leon and spike do no crow anytime soon
---
I wish I could watch my bots replay though
---
What If bo's new art will have him winking?
---
It's not fair :( when you're disconnect then lose -5, but why when you disconnect then win you get none?
---
Bingo
---
This meme is LEGEN... wait for it... DARY!
---
Why and how did this get spoiler tag tho. Oh well xd
---
Yeah Siege is broken, they need to make it more balanced. If you get slightly more bolts every wave, that's actually *worse* because then the opponents will end up with a level 20 siege not at the end.
---
‚ÄúOW, my hand...‚Äù
---
What happens if you don't use it tho?
---
Especially shelly
---
I would give her between eighteen or twenty two, idk it's the most probably
---
I don't ubderstand it
---
Heist is garbage
---
Imagine being a shelly with super
---
This was honestly hilarious. Just watching as they all freak out in realization
---

Like seriously ‚Äúmake it so you can buy emotes with gems‚Äù

Bo should be primo

Brawl stars tracker
---
10/10 would spend money one
---
Looks good but I think the water would be useless. That‚Äôs mostly there to shoot people without being able to get close to them if it‚Äôs in certain spots and you can‚Äôt do that with a fence in front of it.
---
This is gold, not like an average GEDI-KOR skin
---
Sunny in philly is better than both ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
ding dong ur opinion is wrong
---
Or move modded SD altogether to another slot but it's unlocked later on.
---
^primo
---
Who's this brawler gonna be named?
---
Nice, not what I thought but also interesting. I think you made some weird family relations like dinamike being Piper's rich father but it's ok
---
I thought that Darryl could receive the ball and score but you have a good point.
---
Hey over here you forgot to mention the fucking camping pams brocks and colts that wait as you respawn to snipe you dead before you leave the circle you spawn in and when I reported it to supercell all I got was basically like an oh well too bad deal with the fucking assholes also here k got you a gift (me ooh what is it) *gets -999999 trophies in siege with randoms*
---
Good bot
---
LOL
---
How about we switch siege and brawl ball in your plans and it's gonna be okay. Good idea tho!

congrats im really  proud of you

for beating me :)

Oh true, you can probably get more from Ticket Events. I forgot about those. \&gt;.\&lt;

Ya it's the seasons

How does the throwing AND rolling work? Sounds interesting.

Wow

r/whoosh

Nobody:

u/Hey_Look_Issa_Fish :

‚ÄúNobody plays brawl ball anyways‚Äù
---
You guys ever wondered why he has a 3 ammo count despite the fact he has 4 rockets in his rocket launcher???
---
The Ike is the turret, the bot is probably what you‚Äôre thinking of
---
Why are the shirts in Korean lol
---
He throws a barrel just like dynamike, has same range as barley. And after the barrel lands, it rolls for 2 more tiles dealing extra damage.
---
Oh so thats why it didn‚Äôt work :(
---
Hen you get squeezed in the balls
---
So, what if a player is on edge and tide starts rising, will the players be pushed inside the map, or will he be floating (and taking some damage overtime).
---
I really big ##F
---
Cause it‚Äôs from a Korean site lol
---
r/shellygang
---
Yep.
---
*sad trompet*
---
??? Still confused. Please explain. Also, if you want to r/woooosh me, please do it correctly.
---
If you don‚Äôt open the game and click on the new game mode before it changes you technically lose your free tokens.
---
Well I don‚Äôt r/woooosh people often, do my bad. It‚Äôs a joke though what else is there to explain?
---
"CREEtures oF thE NIghT"
---
He is out enjoying nature, you wouldn't want to get your hat dirty would you?
---
r/woooosh
---
from the moment you start living, that is your age so technically i think frank would be the youngest depending on his time of activation
---
Is that only on tik tok
---
But what‚Äôs the joke? It‚Äôs not much of a joke to make an unoriginal Leon super post and then joke in the comments that it‚Äôs definitely not a Leon super joke.
---
WTF DID YOU BRING UP-
---
Why does everyone want the loading screen changed??? It was changed from Poco and Nita, to the awesome one we have now two days before global (nice way to be inconsiderate community, real niceüòí) it pains me to see SuperCell under all this stress, they listen to the community but require time to execute the plan, people think that they have NASA Super Computers which they don't, and SuperCell if by the off chance you're reading this, thanks for all the dedication you put to your games to make them the best they can be and I hope that you will reach the likes of Nintendo and Top company's like that, have a awesome jump up day, and make any ounce you want to make your games how you've imagined them to be!üòâ
---
Your post has been removed, make sure to use the body of a post to elaborate on the title.
---
I didn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs a good joke. Joke is made + person does not understand joke = r/wooosh
---
I know what a woooosh is
---
It's been some time...
---
Lmao good job, glad I‚Äôm not the only global player to reach 10 in 3 months
---
So what is the issue..?
---
Well I am a Youtuber ........ sooooo I‚Äôm used to saying this and it not begging its asking
---
Idk
---
Just confused
---
But honestly, this message from Ryan must be a joke tho. They release the Brawl Talk whenever they‚Äôre ready, not when they get to a milestone og subscribersü§î
---
Water bad. Water glitch is a problem and too cramped.
---
I love this meme and how alive Shelly looks
---
That moment when OC has 5 times more trophys on spike than me. Thats really dope.
---
What are you talking about, the earth is clearly a trapezoid
---
Nerf Shelly but she‚Äôs weak at higher trophies
---
HOW DO I MAKE A LENNY FACE
---
same here with my frank
---
Game since the Beta came out, I have 8256 trophies, I just have no more because I lost the account that I had on the Iphone and created the new one when it went to android, not to mention that my cell broke 4 months, I only play 3 hours with cell phones lent .
---
What exactly is brawl talk, asking because I'm confused lol
---
ELI5 anyone
---
Love it!
---
I think you got the bottom 2 images reversed
---
But yeah, Matchmaking for Trophies is crap, so it's done based on Brawlers.
---
I don‚Äôt know why, but I feel her name is Bruise or Bruisy (since she looks like a melee fighter with her baiting gloves)
---
Frank needs a buff ....
---
Probably an early model
---
Ooooooooo, this is even better than the Shelly one!
---
Also Crow Phoenix Skin
---
UR PLAYING SOCCER WITH A BASKETBALL. Like my classmates when their desperate for a ball lmao
---
Actually I'm not part of a gang yet
---
I heard that in other supercell games, scammers can convince supercell support they are you and gain access to your account if they have your gem count :p
---
Maybe the picture is not that great as i thought lol
---
No
---
Reminds me of sans lol.
---
That‚Äôs basically the same thing.
---
Bb, heist and solo sd!
---
Wow can I know how many trophy you have and what‚Äôs your % now ?
---
I feel bad for those guys xd
---
Yes
---
Yu beat me to it congrats
---
Check my profile. I did Tracer already üëåüèª

How bout siedge
---
A megabox is just 10 brawl boxes, just open every box until you get a leggy
---
*And we never saw him again*
---
Congrats!
---
I‚Äôve got a leon at rank 20 but he‚Äôs sadly dying at 454 trophies
---
Oh ok thanks.
---
The mods are offline and this is what you post... Brilliant.
---
I bought Carl. I had 65 gems (from boxes only), so...
---
Oh thanks!
---
Well, there are still mariachis today so, depending when he died he could be anything from 16 to 350
---
But it paid off üòâ
---
Just realized that my Battle Tokens are nice.
---
What's wrong?
---
Please tell me what u think about this concept
---
He is angry on his trophy count
---
Sorry, I don't understand.
---
Lol true
---
Maybe take those 2 pictures and reverse them so there facing the other way
---
Eat the box?
---
EAT THE BOX?
---
What?
---
The kind of memes that make me laugh xd
---
OMG look at how many boolts they haf!!!
---
It is much more easy remember for old player.
---
Why are Carl's eyes poorple nice loading screen btw I hope it will get add lolol
---
I did it with 4
---
Night witch mortis succs, so does T Series, Watchmojo and teamers

OMG. WHAT is he dooing with his hoonds omg

Cactus shelly

Energy drinks are TOO op

You just deafited a god

Again, he wouldn't have saved anything. There is no point.

This is already in game files at 800 trophies we just need to wait until update

Yeah level 69...... They may think it's a joke

#BrawlTalkOrWeWalk
---
Do you mean the throwers are similar to eachpther but unique compared to the others? If so ill repeat: if you consider them the same uniqueness that proves that rarer brawlers arent necessarily more unique since barley is rarer than dynamike.
---
hey hey those animations are amazing and it is based in Japan not China.
---
Why not brawlsketbal
---
(Basketbal)
---
I‚Äôm no map design expert but I think it looks pretty cool (5). Would work well for bounty.
---
Pan
---
*Insert obligatory communist joke here*
---
It was not meant to be racist or what ever and yeah, the animations may be cute, but I really just care about Brawl Talk at the moment
---
That's so good
---
Not underrated, its just we‚Äôre too poor to get him
---
But in what way is he more unique? What characteristic of his is more unique than dynamike jessie, or bo? On a similar note, what makes him less unique than piper, pam, or tara? Your comment still is just restating that rarer is the same as more unique without giving any supporting points.
---
I don't get it
---
Carl is cute, Darryl is as well. :p
---
Colored nicknames.
---
That's all you need to know.
---
For the people who needed to get a canadian account for the game in ios
---
I don't think crow is that bad, people just use him wrong. I think he's more of a support brawler that just stays at a distance keeping enemies away. I don't own him though
---
 
---
plz up-vote
---
here is my map link:
---
[https://crux.page.link/RvQq](https://crux.page.link/RvQq) map name:hide,jump, brawl.
---
i have made this map for showdown i have thinked for so mush thinks during making it like making a good amount of grass and walls and open spaces so every brawler can have successes on it,hope you enjoy it i have make it because i love brawl stars and i always wanted to make my one map,thanks for any youtuber if you watch it like coash cory, kairos time lex, bentime ,have a good day and if you meanchend it in a video i well be so happy
---
note : subscribe to brawl stars YouTube channel so we well see the brawl talk soon !!!

Poor Spike. We all know that his sense of judgment is underdeveloped. He didn‚Äôt know what he was signing off on.
---
#COOL
---
Thanks, I hate it
---
At least bo got a remodel
---
Nice repost you got there. Would be a shame if everyone noticed...
---
U're not alone
---
It looks so shit
---
I don't see Brock with them
---
WTF? REPOST!!!!!
---
That's an unfortunate situation ur in my guy, if support. If you refund the skin they might give u negative gems. Risky man. But Try contacting Google play or Apple store support üôÇ
---
Uuh i dont remember when rockets start appearin... Ggs tho thats cool XD
---
Noo! I dont have dat much gems :(
---
Oh. Sh!t, thanks.
---
It's a fucking cartoon of 1980s. A Kid must have designed it
---
I assume they did this to avoid complaints of racial insensitivity, so they went with this camper look instead. But why give his vest the ugliest shade of green feasible
---
I'm scared for her
---
GEDI-KOR's version of Bo was much better I think... Also I hope someone will make cute arts with Nita and Penny in new skins :D
---
Not my problem chief
---
They literally just made him look more cartoony... man wtf is going on at Supercell, this update and new brawler is literal ass.
---
They call her a ‚Äòboxing botanist‚Äô and she heals in bushes because plants, so the plant connection is pretty obvious
---
Is it out Now?
---
Everyone who sees this pls downvote this shit
---
Actually i like Bunny Penny
---
I actually like it lo
---
Lucky, I was playing alone and 2 Pams were in my team.
---
3 Pams = lot of heal
---
Worst. Update. Ever.
---
They were probably well into the design process before Gedi posted his idea
---
Nitas only skin is just a recolor and penny only has a limited time skin
---
[removed]
---
Wow this concept is amazing
---
What rarity is Rosa? Also btw the ‚ÄòTry‚Äô button I think has to do with skins, not brawlers.
---
*made with mematic*

thanks! :)

Just for entertainment boiz üòäüòã

yea

Could've meant green gloves

poco/shelly/colt/nita

Actually yes :(
---
I don't like it either sorry Supercell
---
Thanks for making these
---
u/phlorpe‚Äòs is better.
---
I am with you
---
That's why the Spike near Ryan look so sad
---
&lt;c#&gt;COOL&lt;/c&gt;
---
The next time I should do the new brawler or Bo remodel
---
Your overall ranking? Considering the extra time they had i would rate 3/10
---
This remodel is similar to rico.Old was better.
---
its her super not her star power idiot
---
Stolen from brawl talk comments but whatever
---
I remember I was in this friendly game and the game after this, all those bulls changed to dynamikes and did the same thing on a different map
---
Is there any other brawler you know whose super can deal damage to brawlers in contact with them?
---
Hahaha I get that you‚Äôre trying to sound like a good guy and everything but Supercell‚Äôs remodel of Bo doesn‚Äôt come close to GEDI‚Äôs. Just stop. I‚Äôd rather keep the old Bo tbh, this new one looks like it came straight from the Looney-Toons.
---
Fuck
---
Plus darryl star power
---
Couldn't agree more
---
Darryl star power as super/Gene star power as actual star power (kinda)
---
Dynamike left the planet*
---
How about putting meteor modifier in the most teaming heavy maps
---
Rarity?
---
Gedi_Kor: am I a joke to you supercell?
---
I do
---
No need to be rude.
---
Edit: if you saw the brawl talk, then you already know what her name is.
---
Not worth it bro
---
SUCH A THICC ASS
---
I don't think it is. Because when they shown in game this skin it wasn't menrion limited time skin
---
theres only three mythics too if you count properly üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
I know it seems obvious but why do people downvote when im just stating the name reference :/
---
They ran out of ideas
---
I dont really like the fact that the new skins are  for the ones that already have seasonal skins/regular skins already. 
---
Im really curious for the new interface tho and the new brawler, I wanted more tanks in game cause the options was kinda limited.
---
I just saw the brawl talk
---
Straight from Looney-Toons.
---
its called getting the joke
---
I prefer the old one... even if he dosen't have a string for his bow or his chest need a fix
---
F
---
Sorry,I repost this to add Brock,because I forgot him.
---
It wasn't even a model just a picture. Plus it doesn't feel like a base model for me it could be a skin tho.
---
what do you mean sparse we get 1 every month at this rate..
---
Wait what? U said Rosa is ‚Äòanimal‚Äô and I said no. U must have mistyped
---
I can 100% agree with that, and to add for that they also made it longer by 2 weeks!
---
Ahahaha
---
I can't think anymore after seeing that BOOOOOO remodel. BOOOO
---
El Primo + Darryl = Rosa
---
I dont even have spike
---
i love you
---
Where is Piper‚Äôs skinüòíüòûüòî
---
Yeah... I was like"OMG YES BO REMODEL!!!" then I saw it... Why Supercell? We asked for a good remodel! Also if you buff Crow don't make him like OP
---
Sorry i messed up with the photo... I meant to use a different one...
---
Very

Shelly and brock did some oopsie,then thrown her into then spike jungle ,they gave her some flowers and then she went to the primo fighting center

Very good observation dude . I'm overwhelmed

Ok some things I noticed:

- his hair is showing now owo
---
- the bow in his hand has the string so it makes sense now
---
Not really brock,more shelly

um bruh its a game for mostly children and they made it more childish to fit the game
---
No looks like ass. Why did I ever ask for a remodel why why why

Who doesn't have a triangular prism for a chest

I agree with most of your points, but how would you fix teaming in showdown? I think the way they trying to fix it is not bad.

It's worst lmao

Everyone is hating on the green shirt. No one even noticed the current model has the green pants.
---
Aren't all YouTubers occasionally cringy?
---
NOW
---
same. idk why people are hating it.. i actually kinda like it. it's way better than the old one!
---
Eagle‚Äôs eye
---
Ofc they deserve access but is just that beta player would a better usage of that brawler
---
New mechanic, a shield that reduces damage taken. Poor daryl
---
Amazing
---
Brawl tv üòç
---
Dude, just why.
---
At least Spike got laid
---
So original..
---
how wouldn't he have saved a trophy, he would've escaped down and hid in a bush so that the teamers go after someone else.
---
Because it is very sad ü§òüòî
---
Crow buff is finally here
---
Jey man come on at least they put the string on his bow this time
---
WhY dO yOu HaVe To TeLl Me HoW tO lIvE? It‚Äôs my choice if I want to commit tax fraud, not yours.
---
The modifier changes have stopped the teaming while it‚Äôs happening, but what if there‚Äôs no modifiers? I want real justice. I want people temp banned if they‚Äôre doing it.
---
Removed - DO NOT SUBMIT POSTS WITH TITLES IN ALL CAPS. CAPS LOCK IS CRUISE CONTROL FOR COOL
---
What if Rosa was Shelly's mother?
---
At least the new remodel makes him look as cute as Nita......
---
Its a celebration
---
Hopefully it happens to me too.. I already have Leon, so I wish for Spike or Crow. Supercell please hear me!
---
Ryan: when will see actual progression content and a use for bands? I have to say, me and other high trophy players are sick of having nothing to do.
---
Also, the meteor changes sound like they could be frustrating... Imagine if two people are close to each other because they are trying to fight, and now more often than before we would see meteors that are randomly adding RNG to those fights. 
---
Why not just use life leech game mode more often? Everyone liked that game mode a lot and it is perfect to solve teaming.
---
Good point, but the mortis still had a chance to run down because there was nobody there.
---
Affronta l'arena in solitaria o in coppia e batti tutti gli avversari per vincere!

---
Barley needs a nerfed he does to much damage
---
Weird flex but ok
---
Rosa comes out with the update?
---
Sry about the bad camera setup, I had to do it with a computer.
---
oh my god no, did you see in the video bull's close range only dealt 300!! that means if she got her shield on it's nearly invincible!  
---
Invinicibility of spawn: Am I a joke to you?
---
How many trophies do u have?
---
Yes! Like maybe the bunny ears instead of a hat
---
I‚Äôm so glad you noticed it üôèüèª
---
I think he is balanced.
---
you're on reddit, have you seen all the posts about teaming. And even a team with 6 people, they won't accept you into the team because they already have 6 people.
---
They are bugging crow ,go check brawl talking slow it down,during 0:09-0:10 there‚Äôs a crow in the bottom attacking a penny and it show that poison per second is increased to 105 and damage per blade to 420 Ôºà1834-1729=105Ôºå1729-469=1260Ôºå1260/3=420Ôºâ
---
This is some rule 34 shit
---
ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Insane mode?
---
Lol how old are you?
---
Tax fraud is a crime. Teaming up it‚Äôs a strategy to win a game match üòÜ
---
Btw I‚Äôve just realize you‚Äôre a kid so this is my last comment on this post
---
First of all, the update didn't take 2 months. 1 and a half. Supercell said that it usually takes a couple of months to make a update, and they've just been in superfastmode after global. That seems to be a bad decision, as now people are complaining about not getting a new update every month. I bet they are releasing the updates as fast as they can, you shouldn't complain about that.
---
About teaming. I know this isn't a big difference, but it might help. Teaming is complicated to fix, we should be happy that they are doing something to it. 
---
About Rosa, she might seem unoriginal, and as I haven't played with her (obviously) I have no idea about how unoriginal or original she is. The super is basically Darryls star power, but you don't have to have a maxed Rosa or roll 7 tiles to activate it. Every brawler has similarities and could be compared in the same way as you do with Rosa. 
---
Also, who says this is all the content we get? We got  4 remodels in the February update, and they didn't say anything about them in the Brawl Talk. Maybe we get a Tara remodel or voice? Ir maybe they add some more content we want, but they didn't say anything in the Brawl Talk.
---
Lmao you must have 200-300 trophies with barleyüòÇ
---
Finally an honest name
---
That‚Äôs pretty much how I got spike. 
---
Was hoping to get Leon before the next brawler comes out tho to have them all for a bit at least but nah -,-
---
Party all day, I know that you've been waiting
---
true dat
---
It feels really good
---
Someone needs to make a gif of this.
---
Well we got the Brawl Talk...
---
because you cant attack and heal up in one time (cuz life leech restores your health) but if you are almost killed by someone and you want to heal up, you just can't
---
He's not a dps brawler. He's a control brawler. He's not trash. He's just a high skill cap brawler and if played correctly, can be devastating. He doesn't need a buff. He can also be a decent counter to Pam if played on the right map.
---
Don't ask for a Barley buff if you don't even know how to play him correctly. Just GIT GUD.
---
If there's someone on your random team with those names you know you've already lost
---
if she has a new attack animation then shell be better
---

If mortis has a girlfriend I hope it‚Äôs a Lolita goth type chick that floats like the royal ghost from clash royale.
---
There holding my precious crow for ransom
---
Except with different pics
---
It's bad
---
make crow say "buff me"
---
Means sarcasm. You add it if you are trying to convey sarcasm but I don‚Äôt like using it bc it ruins whatever you‚Äôre trying to say
---
y'all will regret this watch
---
Everything satisfies me except for why the fuck they put a second eagle on the arrow holder.
---
BO FINALLY HAS A STRING
---
Lol platonic spike x rosa is better
---
I love the Penny skin though, I don‚Äôt like the 4th Nita skin :p.
---
Tnks B34R
---
Crow is the most annoying Brawler in the game and I dont have him so WHY
---
This community can be a bunch of entitled idiots sometimes. Stop shitting on supercell for remodeling a brawler
---
If you say so
---
Nice
---
Poco
---
Wait...why Brock? It was supposed to be Shelly
---
Teaming isn't something you can just fix and it's not even problem they caused in first place
---
I got the impression you could try skins before you buy them
---
Yeah that‚Äôs true but like I‚Äôm sure a large demographic is teenagers too and like one I also don‚Äôt really like this remodel
---
Teasing us with that crow buff.
---
Are you romanian?
---
Do you know what /s means?
---
Rosa‚Äôs mechanics aren‚Äôt that special: her main (Primo‚Äôs main), her super (Darryl‚Äôs sp), her sp (Spike‚Äôs sp). And she looks like a Shelly who is 50 years old.
---
I have a drop chance of .1 I‚Äôve never gotten a legendary and I‚Äôm at 5k trophies. I think it just increases slowly
---
Loli moments.....
---
Shiba Nita is ADORABLE! I love it!
---
Ikr
---
i hated sd so much i would play with bots for the coins
---
His head looks nice but the rest of the body looks weird imo I prefer the old one
---
We don‚Äôt need any legendaries, mythics, or epics too. They‚Äôre already so hard to get and just adding more of them would be annoying.
---
Oh but it is green not yellow
---
First name change is FREE, and then you must pay
---
4k HD: leon
---
When the new model isn‚Äôt bad but you are so obsessed with upvotes that you just find a way to incorporate gedi kors
---
This is not a platform to call people out smh
---
quit button please
---
Can you just be exited for what supercell give you ffs
---
I prefer the old one bc this one looks like it was made with a rush, doesn‚Äôt look polished
---
I honestly preferred the old Bo. Bo's new arrows look really weird, the eagle heads are weird (looked better in the old version), the horrible green, and why is there an eagle head on the quiver?  
---
It might be like Night Witch Mortis, which looks horrible in the menu but cool in game, which is the only way to console people. Saying it's good is just pointless.
---
Oh, which means I can don‚Äôt change my name even after the update and gets a free change?
---
If you are above 400 trophies with any brawler every map has too much teaming
---
My guess is Epic. And she will probably release near the end of April
---
100,000,000
---
Let's see...
---
Night üÖ±Ô∏èitch: 
---
Looks horrible in the menu
---
Looks decent in gameplay
---
üÖ±Ô∏èo remodel:
---
Looks pretty cool in the menu
---
Looks great in gameplay (you can see him while they're showcasing Rosa)
---
I was a bit underwhelmed at first, but it's definitely grown on me! I personally am quite pleased.
---
I'm currently at 2.7k trophies and no legendary brawler.  
---
It sucks that the chances are so low. 
---
Pretty much a Cashgrab putting a brawler for 50‚Ç¨ in the store and waiting for people to buy gems.
---
Imagine being so stupid that you think that the only reason crow is bad is because a few people use him like a bull.
---
She will
---
You sounded like a kid who likes to throw the game.
---
Yo this skin is pretty cool
---
More like primo was the step dad.
---
Laugh in spanish
---
wonderbrad and ....
---
It's funny to see that we actually wanted crow to get nerfed back then LOL
---
People they tried, what do you what quantity over quality. We more thankful with the thing you have.
---
This whole roster is composed of tropes.
---
Most brawlers got a remodel when jessie did
---
What is rarity of Rosa green rare?
---
They spend 3 months on that, and it's VERY polished
---
Don't forget about Bull!
---
Then focus on eating. But apparently you care so much that you have to reply to me
---
He needs more range and maybe another dagger to throw to make it easier to hit people with 2 at once. No major buff though.
---
Hi
---
Yeah basically. I'll get a legendary one day
---
For someone that is themed jungle i think that vest does not suit him
---
now their names can rest in peace
---
Don‚Äôt talk shit about ricochet
---
ITT: People taking a joke way to serious.
---
rosa looks like my grandma
---
what are you confused about, the thing on his coat is just a decoration common on trench coats to keep the breat tight or undo for a loose fit.
---
oh shit so i got r/woooosh'd by r/wooooshing a person who r/woooosh /s'd another person. damn

Ahahah yes buddy it‚Äôs [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/bcq0qd/proof_that_crow_will_get_a_buff/?st=JUFLO3YV&amp;sh=fa57c454) why

Thanks for the video! This all looks great!
---
Just be grateful jeez
---
Ikr I hate how people can‚Äôt be happy what they get
---
no way please...
---
no thats why i asked
---
The fact that they ‚Äúworked hard‚Äù on this remodel and it looks worse is highly disappointing
---
I ghave made new skin Dumpling Drayl
---
sounds hurt
---
Frank confirmed on twitch (In the Brawl TV stream) that Rosa is a super rare
---
üé∂ There are zombies on your lawnüé∂
---
Did u do it already???
---
Yknow, not a big fan about the new model but this fanart is pretty great
---
He‚Äôs the the whole Lara Croft chest going on, so that was thing people were hoping for them to fix.
---
Good catch
---
He'll be missed :(
---
4600 damage at power level 1 imagine her at Max level
---
Epic brawler, her mechanics are a bit more complex than el primo's not to mention they have similar main attacks so it wouldn't make sense making her a rare brawler.
---
The real battle royale
---
Urgh, this subreddit
---
Wait, my favorite brawler is piper...
---
at least penny had an open slot
---
I dont think she will be 80 gems, this skin changes her pose so i bet she will be 150 gems and 109 with discount
---
Don‚Äôt worry she‚Äôs fine haha
---
Shaco
---
Hopefully. I‚Äôve been building up my legendary chance for a while now. I don‚Äôt want it to reset again.
---
No you aren't
---
If Pam gets her much needed nerf, Crow will be much more viable in those 3v3s I believe.
---
Where did you get those stats. She has got less punces than el primo and they deal something on 600 at max dmg. It can't be 4600
---
Cursed spike
---
That's so dumb how the developers will only buff crow if we subscribe to their YouTube channel. That's not how game developers should think
---
nope. idc abt ur opinion so don‚Äôt care abt mine.
---
I am helping fund a game most of you are playing for free, the user base was loud and clear with what they wanted for Bo's remodel and it fell on deaf ears as usual.
---
If people didn't buy Gems this game would be canceled, so vour welcome you freeloader.
---
Keep trying derogatory insults, makes you seem real intelligent.
---
People are open to opinions and this is mine.
---
I hope that shiba nita appear in one of the sakura spike shorts
---
Ikr! The bomb on the tip makes it look like its made by nerf.
---
darryl is more balanced than in need of a buff
---
shiba nita doesn't have a new attack animation. She attacks in part of the brawl talk and it's the same animation
---
Well yeah, it‚Äôs because bo‚Äôs old forest green pants compliments the brown vest. It‚Äôs a good color palette. This new model is just neon green which looks very off.
---
Xd that‚Äôs how the pros do it
---
legends say he‚Äôs still taking screenshots
---
Puberty hit Doge hard.
---
Ur tuff
---
Btw what is Bruce saying?
---
no its the same as now !
---
that's drew not frank in the top pic
---
the gedi kor remodel kinda removes bo's personality so i'm glad they didnt go for it
---
WTF? Why did you draw a crappy version of crow?
---
What are you sorry for?
---
Lmao. I know how you feel. I got Gene too from one single box after doing a lot of opening.
---
That‚Äôs against the blue background though. Maybe it will look different on a map?
---
Wrong sub.
---
whoops i‚Äôm wrong
---
I choose mega box because it‚Äôs faster to open, as I believe they have the exact same odds of everything
---
Brawlers release:
---
Leon - Legendary
---
Gene - Epic
---
Carl - Super Rare
---
Rosa -  Epic ???
---
   
---
if we follow the pattern, but is my  speculation
---
what
---
I am not well learned about this but I have seen a video already from a guy who analyzed her and well, that's all I know about her but from the gameplay I have seen on Brawl Talk she's looks pretty dope, she just need a bit of balance on her abilities that's it however they did a pretty good job with this brawler :)
---
I hope so too!!! It'd be adorable hchsj
---
Bad bot
---
UI change too.
---
Yes, she reduces about 80% of the damage.
---
I don't know about crow's poison though
---
+darryl+ gene ... darryl‚Äôs star power (close to her super )and u can say gene‚Äôs star power ( close to hers)
---
"Study well~"
---
Of likelihood
---
It would be cool if his quiver was an actual eagle that handed him arrows during a game with its beak. This quiver right now actually look stupid af
---
Awww
---
Not bad is a opinion. And from the fact upvotes outnumber down votes, looks like most people disagree with you.
---
I feel like this change is gonna affect people fighting at close range which usually are tanks and doesn't team so anytime you'll try to take on a teamer meteorite will target you which could be even worse.
---
We'll have to see though.
---
Crow doesn't need a buff 
---
It's just that pam hard counters him, and she's everywhere, and poco to a certain degree
---
He's pretty good in showdown already, i don't think 3v3's fit him that much because he takes a long time to kill people but they just respawn a few seconds later
---
there's gonna be balancing but it's probably gonna be shown in another vid
---
press f to pay respects poor tara :(
---
PLEASE SUPERCELL DO THAT
---
I hope they add this to the game.
---
This is as good as a gedi kor skin
---
yeah and its an unfair comparison since one is 2D and the other is 3D
---
1344 damage per hit? What are you talking about...
---
Gosh can people like you stop mentioning Gedi Kor to work at Supercell, he literally said he can't make 3D ARTS to create model like this
---
Maybe yes, poate =))
---
can i have free jems
---
Looks like her! Haha
---
I think the plant‚Äôs involves her neck. We will need to wait some animations like Sakura to see it.
---
Are you blind by chance.
---
I'm talking about the paw pose.
---
it‚Äôs on her back you can see it barley
---
Tbf the most consistent *and* consuming playerbase is most likely 15-25 years old.
---
I don't see why they cater the children on this game. They aren't the ones they profit from meaning that they aren't the players that invest time in this game. People who pay for in-app purchases (mostly teens and adults 15-25) are the ones that tend to invest more time in the game because they spent money on it and want their money's worth. 
---
I really don't get why they want to appeal more to kids, who they barely profit from.
---
Gene is not epic
---
crow is fucking balanced you're all just going with the flow
---
Yeah, I agree the community can be cancerous. I for one try not to give supercell a difficult time cause they already made a fantastic game, but just kinda wished they chose a different color palette. The neon green is an eye sore. Other than that, I‚Äôm glad they changed the proportion of bo‚Äôs body
---
Most of the time, people get upset when I don‚Äôt agree with them :p
---
Y‚Äôall wild coming up with these things lol
---
No. Are you?
---
She does 1344 dmg per hit//700 per fist
---

So Spike was murdered and stuffed, meanwhile Shelly purposely gained weight and changed her hairstyle in an attempt to evade the authorities.
---
The new plant from plants vs. zombies:
---
Esti roman? :))

OwO
---
Great..... The new brawler is a bush camper
---
Rip gedi kor

Dap =)))))
---
I bet you rosa is shelly's lost mom
---
mybe they will come back.

Would be cool if sakura spike saw nita bringing Bruce for a walk while they just wave at each other
---
Same here
---
I was about to make this exact meme! GG's, you got there first
---
How am I being stupid by stating that it looks childish. Something that u literally agreed with
---
People should wait how it looks when you're on the map
---
Oh so 672 times three is 1344
---
He's lost his Mr. Incredible on his day off vibe..

In the world we live in, Gedi‚Äôs remodel idea would be super controversial. It sucks.

Like Bo was once a mythic ?
---
I understand you. You make some good points. Supercell is making it so childish it may hurt the E sport reputation. Yeah, at least supercell KIND OF listens but not really... they refuse to add any Gedi Kor Skins... but the luck system is terrible though. It‚Äôs ass.

You can like whatever you like,in my opinion old bull is better.

Funny, like really funny, I hope that we will never see them in game again
---
Best Ted Talk ever!
---
What I was thinking is, she's gonna wear that footballfish and light will emit in front of her.
---
but whatever, both works.
---
‚Äú50 gems is a pretty reasonable price.‚Äù After seeing how they priced emotes in Clash Royale, 50 gems seems untrue.
---
Bo looks completely fine. If he had those little feathers at each end of his head, he would look great. You guys are also forgetting that 3D models are harder to implement than 2D, so the amount of effort SC put into this skin is about as much effort as Gedhi did. You guys are just repeating the exact same shit as with Rico.
---
You cropped it out
---
Yeah. They're married. That's what happens :/
---
Indefinitely
---
Very nice!
---
ok?
---
Her hair should be red, and resemble a rose just enough for it to makes sense, but not so much that it looks like a hat.
---
Until you have to unplug life support to charge your phone
---
Spike pull out game weak. Confirmed worst legendary
---
You have that weird capital "i"
---
This is basicaly like the ricochet remodel, most of the ppl liked new ricochet remodel but some didnt (including me), but instead of lot of ppl liking this remodel, most of the ppl dont like this remodel
---
Primo's arms tho
---
left one looks a bit retarded
---
Chief we got em
---
Because the geometry of his chest was literally a triangle, and it‚Äôs been that way since beta, so he has needed one for a while
---
Every remodel has done that so far. Jessie‚Äôs turret got turned into a dog. Brock used to look badass and mortis looked ‚Äúmeaner‚Äù (for lack of better words). It‚Äôs the direction they chose to take the game.
---
He is (probably) blind. So yeah, literally retarded.
---
Netflix and chill sorry WaNT mE To sHOw yOu?

:P

Nah, its gonna be starting brawler like shelly

Who‚Äôs also related to Ben Rollins

I said PLATONIC you dumbass
---
Personally I dislike both of them. The Gedi one is too extra, and the supercell one is just an embarrassment.
---
And Pam just throws her healing well away
---
Am I the only one who likes the remodel? It gives bo a unique identity and makes him look different which I like
---
Shelly hair
---
No, its gonna be at the trophy road for -150 trophies

That's just predicting your enemy's movements. It's pretty easy to master and almost all pros can do it.

I thought you were making underwear out of brawlers. Honestly, don't they look like underwear?

Your gonna be streaming for a long time

Exactly, I think this is a way better option then changing Jessie's core mechanic.
---
How many players do you know over 40 which plays Brawl Stars, except Lex. Super Mario works for both because it's and old childish game, old people played it when they were children and Assasin Creeds are pretty boring for children, a child won't play a 20‚Ç¨ game (or how much it is) with story, only multiplayer free-to-play games. At 7 years you shouldn't even play any game, Brawl Stars is a 9+ game. And for an example, GTA 5 is played by many children even if it's a 18+, guees why, because is fun and it has multiplayer.
---
But in context of the image?

Since when does bo use an arrow that doesnt explode

Yeah I'm beta too, but I quit for a couple months in between because of the state of the game. I also play pretty much exclusively with randoms so that really doesn't make pushing any easier :(

He‚Äôs dressed like Shaggy from Scooby-Doo, aside from the facial  and structural redesign there is nothing good here. Disappointing especially with how much creativity went into Rico.

SuperCell is doing their damg hardest, they just don't want the game to be Western any more! Look at the bright side at least they did something to teaming is SD.

Leon
---
believe me. i know. i have him and i‚Äôm pretty good with him, i see how bad people are playing badly and aggressive with him and then asking for a buff. if he needs a buff it should be an hp buff and not a huge one. also nerfing pam would help a lot

Fun fact:It‚Äôs my birthday tomorrow!

At least with Bo's remodel they made him look like a father which backs up my theory of him being Nita's dad.

Use her ult to take them out

But, the Bo arrow is a bomb

Because they literally made it worse. That's like us asking for balance changes and then they buff pam.

Check out my last video about my luck on mini

I am dumb. Gow can you get a brawler behind your name?

Would buy even if it cost-ed 500+ gems.

Poco and Colt: Am I a joke to you?

This Is Maded For Fun
---
It is:
---
1) A modded app, not the real game
---
Or
---
2) A edited picture
---
Stop thinking everything they post is real, kid, that can't happen in the game
---
No, you will still have 1 free 90%
---
I think he should be Napstablook
---
i um dont see the sexual appeal of shbia nita
---
Oh well that makes sense than
---
Primo taking the break up with Rosa badly.
---
Finally bois!!
---
Ok now i get it thanks sorry for wasting your time
---
Probably modded app, bc someone who was in my club had dynamike with 21 trophies

don't do it for

*CROW IS CHARA

i opened regular boxes until i‚Äôve got 20k coins. no star powers and no offers for all this period
---
Can you sync to controller?
---
I got way more than i expected
---
Tbh I feel like this subreddit is just lowkey toxic, there‚Äôs nothing wrong with disliking something but I feel like every single thing they do gets bashed on here. As for the new remodel, it still looks actually nice compared to the old one regardless if I don‚Äôt think it came out exactly how I was thinking. Aside from that tho I honestly don‚Äôt like Gedi‚Äôs remodel for Bo so idrc that that wasn‚Äôt implemented.
---
We Fortnite now boys
---
I still love herü•∞ Her gloves look cute and she‚Äôs a boxer. I‚Äôve always wanted a boxer plus she looks funny when standing
---
That's different, kid
---
You could get all brawler from boxes before they added trophy road, and that's fine
---
But this picture of Bo in a box is fake, because it can't happen, kid
---
I totally agree
---
Actually before an hour there were more replies and it was weird but now its ok
---
He didnt need a buff smh. Yall playing him as bull
---
I think the background is for a possible Golden Week event.
---
"...And her super is really cool, is a brand new mechanic from the game..."
---
Nope! They have said that is a new mechanic, not a new super mechanic :)
---
Yes...for some reason...
---
f to pay respects for the name colour fail
---
She‚Äôs literally a better primo, hides in bush to heal, super before you walk out of the bush and just wail on the poor unsuspecting brawler with a shield and full hp
---
im on mobile too btw

In favorable of

He got a remodel
---
This was the biggest meme ever
---
because the community wants constant change for some reason.
---
You forgot to put up the source https://twitter.com/danki0103/status/1117087238536466433
---
Could you do Nita and Darryl?
---
Alright first off.. pardon my language... Second... YALL DONT LIKE ANYTHING THE DEVS PUT IN THE GAME! WHAT THE FUCK! THE WORKED HOURS ON IT PROBABLY! I cant belive you guys... I just cant
---
Shelly players are degenerates
---
I‚Äôm stuck with an abstract Nita. As long as she‚Äôs Shiba, I‚Äôll think I‚Äôll do fine
---
The remodel is okay and I think it's cool. The thing that annoys me about is that Bo looks, well, younger. When you see a character like Bo and hear his voice lines you expect him to be old and wise. When I look at this model and hear the voice lines, I just don't see a good connection between them. If I had to pick between this one and the old one, the old one wins no doubt. Another thing is his eagle hat, it looked more intimidating in the old one. I guess time will tell if I eventually disagree with what I just wrote here.
---
Please draw more, this is amazing
---
That‚Äôs what we all need
---
maybe limited time like the chinese lunar
---
Agree on #2, i have about 7000 trophies and it's already getting boring AF
---
Now all I'm thinking about now is this awkward scene...
---
Fortnite
---
Make this nsfw
---
First, r/comedycemetery   ......................

Second:.................................................. 
---
Crow doesn't need a buff. He dominates in showdown his poison prevent you from healing and he just need to cheap you away and charge his super
---
FACT............................................................... 
---
Crow's super can deal more damage that shelly's when positioned cofrectl
---
Ya ok there spike ?
---
I think this is very well done but it doesn‚Äôt fit the simplistic nature of the game so I don‚Äôt think they would add it. I‚Äôm not saying it doesn‚Äôt look good, but it‚Äôs very full.
---
I hate siege, and usually do not play it. Losing double trophies pisses me off, especially when it's over something dumb like a teammate going AFK. 
---
On the occasion I do play siege I like to use el primo, who would be better at level 10 but I'm not there yet, dynamike who is good at area denial, jessie, who is good at shocking people behind corners, or bull, who can charge the turret from outside its range.
---
I like it more then his tbh but his is good to
---
Tara could work as well, are splashies, maybe Penny?
---
they are ungrateful honestly....
---
Just read my name
---
Then don't play shelly, she's not good on this map anyway
---
Eyyy XD guess they like derpy drawings
---
For sure! Watched it alteady 8 times
---
I think she will be epic , because of all her powers ( sorry for my bad inglish )
---
Lol I get it :D
---
That spike looks hot
---
I used mortis and got it. got lucky
---
Introducing: Rosa - Punches plants in the face! (extra damage to spike; could be a cool detail)
---
I like it more tbh
---
I noticed I had ignored a few replies from people so I thought I'd finally answer. Is that such a bad thing?
---
Ummm wrong number bro
---
But I got 30 in a real match, not a friendly match
---
u/GEDI-KOR ain‚Äôt got shit when compared to this
---
Shelly + Spike =
---
That reminds me of [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/bcq7v0/new_skin_idea_jungle_shelly/eksqxzm/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app)
---
&gt; Or maybe the animation for his Super would still be visible when he uses it inside a bush.
---
That is a fantastic solution that would make him more fair without overly nerfing him. The animation should be pretty pronounced and stay just long enough to make sure people can see he cloaked.
---
Yes, I agree.
---
Next to the plant
---
Ok lmao
---
F to pay respects
---
She was playing minecraft
---
Can people see this?
---
2 tiles*
---
1 tile gaps created by supers don't exist anymore.
---
If its a new rare then everyone is going to just buy it from the shop
---
I know
---
Do you know if the Christmas stuff is coming back next year
---
Frankly, I didn‚Äôt even want a Bo remodel. I wish none of the brawlers were remodeled #keepthenostalgia
---
i had about the same amount of brawlers when i was at that trophy range buddy
---
Credit to u/HereBeJimbo for the meme template!
---
Dynamike would still be OP, same with Darryl, this map isn‚Äôt versatile in any way, everyone will play shotgunners or Dynamike and there are one-tile gaps. Cool Idea but it does not work in reality.
---
Pam skin should be the number one priority
---
:(
---
Nita learns English
---
Mega knight from clash royale
---
Sorry I just hate siege you should try untilting in showdown
---
Ummm... what?
---
I'm don't know but I hope so. It would be pretty awful to make limited time skins and only have them available only that one moment do they should come back annually.
---
This would ender his super useless, both or your "ideas".
---
People have trouble dealing with Leon because of the lack of map awareness. People in higher trophy range have less problem dealing with Leon.
---
Not to say that Leon is not strong, he is. But this is not the way to balance him.
---
If its up to me, I would try to further shorten his super duration or maybe increase shots needed to charge super.
---
I really like the crow one
---
Wait now you can see the pic
---
Then remodel the hell outa tara, that crap is lit.
---
Just add Some arrows in there.
---
Yeah
---
If this is an additional Bo skin then it's okay.  If they are replacing the original with this one it's a serious downgrade.
---
As a nita main, I'm prepared
---
Turret drags people to it. Can't drag people under certain range.
---
Imaginable
---
It‚Äôs all fun and games until she punches those cacti in your nuts
---
My mom still tells me that lol
---
Pam is Jessie‚Äôs mom too, just a reminder
---
This is an awesome idea; adds some more color to the main menu.
---
.... I don't care
---
Nice loading screen concept, but maybe not the best box concept
---
Bounty
---
Onwards, my friends!
---
Hey, you broke my guitar.
---
**Bulls want to know your location**
---
Sounds like you are the bad one
---
Ooo
---
i too poor to afford skins will likely be a Legendary or Epic (which means i wont get her for a while and Bo remodel is bland so yay
---
I admit I‚Äôm not the best out there, but I sure as hell ain‚Äôt the worst. I‚Äôve literally watched my teammates let someone get away with less than 100hp. And yes I say watch because that person happened to be out of my range
---
I love how you turned around the brawlers to make the screenshots
---
Now i don't know if the remodel will be something like this.I wish that remodel too.
---
Lmao. I used Ibis Paint X.
---
One-tile gaps, and don‚Äôt add TNT, it isn‚Äôt in the game and they will not add it soon.
---
r/ColtGang
---
to be fair saying ‚Äòkid‚Äô is annoying and doesn‚Äôt give you the moral high ground
---
Bro, Gedi kor literally made what people on bs hate the most.... TOOK Bo's hat OFF and everyone applauded üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
So true. But only if they have her star power...
---
Either way, I don't think she can beat Bull in a  1v1.
---
Spike first, I want him to have a cute childish voice, hello again!
