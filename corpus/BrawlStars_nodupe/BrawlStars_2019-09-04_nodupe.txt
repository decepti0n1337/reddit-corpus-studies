Good thing for Jessie scrappy is there to tank genes super.
---
I've probably reinstalled the game 5 times. I usually like to play Nita. Can get to 500 trophies easy. But when you reach 500, it gets harder cause you realize everyone maxed out their brawlers and you're still on power 3

This would work as a legendary. Sence he's on the stronger side.

First this man gets gold mecha bo and now he's the first man to get rank 35 bo
---
Well except it reflects not absorbs
---
I agree do you like the idea though?
---
So cute

When you die in duo, all they do is hide in the outskirts. Or when you're fighting a duo team, they just run away with full health. Or when they randomly fixate on killing a team the whole game when it's clearly not worth it, then end up getting killed. Or when they don't go for the middle where there's 7 boxes and instead focus on the 3 boxes surrounding you.
---
I play a lot of duo
---
Yeah this is one of the better bralwer concepts I've seen. Kinda want a full sized version of em'

See you in hot!

I dig it. I like making Brawlers too. I thought about an idea like walking through walls, but I figured they'd be OP. But I like the other ideas you've got going.

Hate the trophy system. Summer update sucked for me. I'm at 15.6k and I get matched up with a bunch of noobs. 10 time I have been matched with like a 10-100 trophy shelly. It's so ridiculousm

I added you to my mini account

Bruh i have 10k almost 11k and i still need spike crow and leon
---
wow outstanding move

Um.... y u üîªed
---
Fhello supercell I came to tell you some suggestions for brawl stars and brawlers
---
1) put the button to report deep subnormal
---
2) more skins
---
3) a new brawler that looks like pam but different
---
I feel like if you emailed them you‚Äôd get more of a response.
---
Thanks
---
yes, but its not funny to spam my damn sub. there's a difference between making a joke, and being an asshole. you clearly can't see the difference
---
Oh no
---
Sorry about shaking the camera lol I was just flabbergasted even while watching the replay
---
I duoed with a person with a 500 Rosa and he had 2000 trophies when I was at 6000
---
The last one was probably unnecessary but still good job
---
I unlocked Leon at 3k, but I really want Gene and Tara too.
---
Haha, yes, this was what I was going for
---
Woah
---
Wait who r u??? I‚Äôm johan!
---
Yep, that was me. I can't say that I'm the best or anything...
---
thats a big nono
---
Before anyone says hes not an og, I checked and he is
---
Being an asshole? Since when was a burn in good fun being an asshole? Are elementary school kids all assholes for doing their yo mama smackdowns and whatnot? No, they aren't. They're having fun. It's not a spam, since I spread it out evenly through r/brawl stars, r/bibigang, and r/8bitgang. I don't make 1000 a day, I stick to like 3 or 4. As long as there are 8bit players burning us back and making memes back, I find the war to be a fun productive thing to do. And there ARE 8bit players doing that, so I don't think I need to stop.
---
Lol we miss you in canga club!
---
How in the El Primo does this have 1.1k dislikes

Dont even like Bibi, its a meme on this sub. You still have no clue what ‚Äúand‚Äù means however

Lol
---
Nice.
---
yuah, you're right

I think it‚Äôs impossible to stop Genes super since it‚Äôs an instant attack
---
Um i think it was a bug that supercell didn't bother fixing or didn't realize
---
Its permanent, i love Brawl Ball too
---
Probably meant star points lol
---

---
What‚Äôs the point in saving them? The more you unlock them the more you have a chance at getting something quicker. For example, you save 50 boxes and the first one happens to be a legendary. Now you just wasted all that time saving for you to get a legendary first shot. Am I wrong? Someone explain I‚Äôm confused
---
They talked about it in the bawl talk
---
Yes its permenant
---
Ofc not, I‚Äôm pretty sure they pushed Rosa when she was op

---
Alright, thanks
---
listen kid, some people take these "war" things way to seriously, and then it becomes my problem, so id appreciate if you'd stop your wacky little memes and ill tell my members to stop aswell. I dont want "war". the leader of Bibi gang doesn't want war. and honestly,I don't want tk go to war with the gang based on my most played brawler (im talking about BiBi. yes, I'm a BiBi main) its just really annoying to have these kids screaming "omg bibi gang hates us ahfhsjsjks" but whatever. i dont fucking care anymore. have your little jokes and whatnot, but if this gets out of hand, its not my fault, and i dont have to deal with it.

Also Rico spamming bounce shots and bush checks, Bo's mines and Piper trying to be 200 IQ

Anyway fantastic art.

What do you mean. I see pros all the time in sd 
---
And they be spinning so hard that they wanna team up with me
---
it's like 8 min up til 1000
---
Prove it. Show me your top brawler lol
---
dhaaahhh it‚Äôs rewond time
---
check my post history. i've gotten 1000+ barley 8 times, and I played with yde and sky during their 1500 push
---
they're not pros. being high trophies and being a pro is different. shit like that is why top players make it a point to not play sd.

Lol don‚Äôt get too cocky I played with a random that had 8 bit at power 1 at rank 30
---
Mostly bb
---
But since I don‚Äôt have a team with that much trophies. And randoms sucks most of the time, I‚Äôve been doing sd

and what do you mean by what server? How can I change my server
---

When did you do this?

look it‚Äôs the number one barley
---
Don't worry there is a tiny microscopic bush below Bull's feet. To think that he moves outside a bush defies biology
---
hi
---
I don't have him, but I feel like he's more of that guy that runs around pissing everyone off by poisoning them and running away.
---
I have enough power points for like 4 brawlers but I dont have the gold :(
---
i lose for 30 minutes
---
the only way to fix it is to make it so the person you pre team up with has about the same trophies on your brawler
---
Nice art! :D
---
Awesome!

Send him friend req then invite him to ur team and then fuc him

Ya same. Did you update app yet? There were one of two mini updates I think. I updated the app and it was fine. I think they‚Äôre fixing them bit by bit. If you‚Äôve already contacted support just wait for them to get back to you. It‚Äôs likely other people using the same phone as you may have the same problems..

Ayyy! Congrats! üòä

You can at least carry a team on bounty, by being smart and staying alive, picking off the opp with most stars. With brawl ball one bad random kills your whole team

Not really, he aimed it.

Is this a new starpower?

it's a friendly match you can't do that easily in a real match

Is very usless in 3v3

This starpower is stupid op in this game mode if you do right. I think mabe Supercell should change it to make 8-bit become invincible and run faster but can shoot and use super while it activated.
---
Yeah, i think i should try some too
---
Pls comment on that so supercell or me can know your opinion for that

did not expect this to 'blow up'

What about r/brawlstarsp

Damn

You can come here to get your prize boy.
---
They don't get enough respect for the stuff they do tbh. Their job is hard af
---
only in showdown
---
Visit r/eyebleach , its easier.
---
Is that even a question?
---
taking into account that every brawler but one has 3 (or 4) ammo, she's effectively invincible with that hp since u had to reload n for that instant had no way to kill her n her ult functions as an extra ammo which does up to 2.5x the dmg of a normal ammo
---
it is true that 8bit has higher dmg than shelly / ammo if he lands every shot, but positioning is much more important for 8bit n it is more difficult to pull off such a play where the enemy has no room to outplay
---
He Aimed Directly At Fence, Knowing He Would Hit The Other Wall Then Bounced On The Fence Then Hit The 8Bit. I Would Say This Is 300IQ Play. Stop Proving Your Point Cuz It Ain't True. You Couldn't Even Do The Same Thing.

But it's weird the Bibi did nothing. Maybe they were organized teamers (press play at the same time so they are already teaming in a showdown without risking backstabbers)

In the first picture there was 2 normal 8bit but at 3rd image there is 2 classic 8bit lmao
---
hate to criticise ur play, but if anything he should have cleared ur turret first (128 hp left bruh), picked up ur power cube then kite around u
---
primo played that **absurdly** poorly n without any respect for respawn buff.
---
Good luck man. :/
---
cant decide if this is sarcastic or not
---
My last legendary was **over a year and a half ago**
---
well -to bad man- but hey he will GET him soon because the session end offer free mega and big box for a cheap price 
---
but I have 2 Brawlers left spike and crow leon is my first legendary :D
---
it's useless in 3v3's only OP in showdown
---
Same, but missing tara too :(
---
already overpowered character gets even more overpowered
---
That would be a lot more balanced
---
/s?
---
Strip 8-bit of his star power early and you don‚Äôt have this problem
---
r/wooosh
---
Everyone : Its free power cubes !
---
Chill its just luck
---
Its like going to a casino and complaining about losing
---
Pack it up, boys, it was fun while it lasted
---
8 bits second power has a 1 coin on it maybe just maybe its the player 1 cuz we know he says "player 1 get ready" and his gun has a p2 and the star power makes you revive one more life maybe its the player 1
---
It's their opinion lol
---
Don't worry, they must have gone to a good place :)
---
Awesome, beautiful
---
Or... acknowledge that it‚Äôs OP, and don‚Äôt use it for the sake of others.
---
but it's doesn't have a special effect and it's not an excuse for 80 tbh
---
chests in minecraft has more useful things
---
Is that Null's brawl?
---
You can destroy an IKE solo with this Star Power.
---
Is that gene's language?
---
Oh come now, that seems harsh, yeah I understand that they need money, but if they didn't care about the players they wouldn't update the game in ways that give us more stuff, cause then we spend less money, so they care at least a little

Hmm but I don't see anyone going to the top left corner to heal. Only bottom left because thats where most people go.

i love how you chose to present it in the 3 panels, very pleasing in terms of layout. mecha crow is my personal favorite, the highlighted shiny bits really take it to the next level.  great job as always ‚ù§Ô∏è am always here to support ur artt !!!

well I had most bizarre strategy went and saved up from 2k didn't unlock Dynamite and so on until I reached the point I have o.1000+ of getting legendary got all brawlers and I took almost the rewards and my second mega box got leon at 7.5k I'm at 10k
---
Dyna skin goes away in 18 hours just try to open some chests for gems

I am making a video about jokes and memes on Brawl stars.

Can I put this there? (I will credit you)
---
I know and i will totally do that next summer, the proper time for that. At first i didnt give him a hat because where i live theres no summer hats, unless you go on a huge vacation but here are not the bug thing.

I like how his name says he doesn't repost but he repost

why is that even a meme its not funny

Is that photoshopüò≥

*Girl walks away*

*Pulls her back*

Tell that to the guy who soloed the IKE in seige.

Ive never seen such thing before

quite risky, if you die once before it becomes useless

What?! tHeRe iS wAtEr?!
---
You‚Äôre acting like you meant to do that lol
---
Dayum primo looks thicccccc
---
You're not the only one who has lwarb
---
i know they are back again, but it was from the first wave of this meme.
---
nah
---
r u VietNamese ?
---
Pretty cool I'll do it on my mini
---
Still possible though
---
No I mean I find myself chasing someone and he goes exactly there not on me I also see other chasing or teaming there
---
Ok mom
---
*It's free showdown wins*
---
Atually i try it in friendly game.
---
(end scene with bot)
---
Will not work, In the notices says if 8 bit is the boss, He can't, so in Big Game, this star power is very useless.
---
Nice :)
---
No it won't
---
Ah yes i think you should get Boosted Rooster(jk i think its better to get Extra Life)
---
I already knew this
---
Or invincibility but you cannot shoot or place super.
---
Siege map is open guy. Try it by yourself and you see
---
Nice art
---
Rush wars isn‚Äôt popular
---
3 star powers are easy to get
---
I hope

ThankYou :3

---
Who doesnt like Ryan? :D
---
I'm pretty sure that it doesn't look like a joke at all.
---
Same
---
He needs more colorful colors i would like a remodel for EL PRIMO
---
Well yes, but actually no.
---
It's said in the notice that it doesn't work in bug game
---
If u are noob, ok
---
I don‚Äôt play trash games
---
said every gemmer ever
---
Boosted Rooster? Lol
---
Very good
---
you probably play a LOT. I'm only at maybe 2.6k and I have a few epics. Unlocking brawlers takes time, not matches logged, at least I think so. Correct me if I'm wrong.
---
We need band-aid Shelly &amp; Rosa, Leon right after realease and old Shelly and Mortis back ha ha
---
And I explained why only default and white need a remodel
---
STFU you stealer!!
---
Well lets just say Nice
---
But you play brawl stars
---
Way better than rush wars
---
Gonna get a lot of hate, but yay.
---
WELL YOUR MOM FUCKING IS TRASH GO CRUSIFY ME
---
It's cuz they on team with bibi
---
I got every brawler once I hit around 7.3k
---
I ended up getting Tara
---
Wow i writed a comment under the post of the template and i said the same things
---
Yeah it‚Äôs called a counter, it‚Äôs not like Shelly just instant kills every single brawler. If you‚Äôre el primo then don‚Äôt go in the same area as the Shelly, let the long ranged brawler handle her
---
To niez≈Çy
---
And also all you gotta do is kill your opponent 8 bit once and his star power will be activated then he will be star power less for the rest of the match so yeah i agree its really situational, people just overeacting just by seeing this video
---
I've already saw the exact "meme" weeks ago, this got stolen?
---
Wait what. What happened while I was asleep
---
Can you show me the post?
---
He meant that Extralife is op because 8bit can take out the siege all by himself.
---
 [You're talking about this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/czi8ny/no_supercell_that_doesnt_seem_broken_at_all/)

he could have destroyed the super. maybe try to hide

8 bit looks depressed
---
r/unexpected911
---
And you did that without the shield, well played
---
So happy you did another one :D
---
Can u dont
---
This star power is NEW, so not all people know about it yet. Also, do u know 8-bit can take out seige machine on his own ?
---
Lol hey! I remember you :)
---
That would be greatly appreciated. You have an awesome style
---
Oh kid..... Go get some knowledge first. People in Reddit are not stupids like you. You stole that from u/ChronoPierce
---
and piper with energy drink
---
No way lol
---
RIP White Crow
---
Is that why it's super easy to kill him
---
IKE needs a buff like dealing 2500 damage on BRAWLERS (Not the siege bot)
---
Shut up you are the joke lol
---
I will post it on Youtube first then on reddit.
---
It will be long since I need to find materials
---
RIP

# YOU FRICKING FRICKS!!
---
I think he should not respawn invincible...... That will be balanced
---
2
---
He has the right amount of thopies
---
What do you mean?
---
Very nIcE
---
probably it's a beta player
---
I bought one with coins (Coiled Snake, don‚Äôt regret it), would be missing 8 otherwise too
---
not nice u get 1 downvote
---
since i bought both of his skins,i'm all in for it
---
Its extra life
---
Yeah but in duos all people get to respawn but only 8-BIT gets to respawn with his sp. Plus it takes 15 seconds to respawn in duos and 0 seconds with the new sp.
---
Wow crow says I‚Äôm the boss of bosses, I could‚Äôve sworn I hear him say I‚Äôm the boss of awesome:(
---
If you‚Äôre talking about showdown smoke death, the rank depends on amount of health before you die. A 960hp brawler will get higher rank than someone with 200hp even though they die at the same time.
---
It‚Äôs broken
---
those 2x and 3x offer typically have same amount of gems as shop value but it comes with mega boxes. if you don't care about boxes then extra gems are good. also now days they are putting in gold in offers and reducing gems so 25% extra gem offer is a good offer.
---
Holy god,how did three supers get charged? That honestly seemed impossible to pull off,but nevertheless, good job,mate.
---
Not rlly the third. It's only the third time I showed it here. It probably happened to me like 7 times in total..
---
Band aid 2.0
---
In duos u can respawn all u want so long as ur teamate is still alive. With this star power u only get 1 extra life. And if u die, u basically are just playing 8bit without a star power.
---
I saw a video of 8bit fully taking down a siege machine using it
---
Maybe after they watching this. But you right, anyone will know about this tactic soon.
---
Would this be constituted as a mosaic?
---
Don't forget seige ... if you can get 8-bit up to the IKE unnoticed, it's game over.
---
Yup, but mine's not as intense as yours, it's like less FPS but still works. Need to be fixed though
---
nah,smack a pillow
---
Another 500 starpoint skin i think?
---
The fuck
---
Too op. No way
---
more like mountain hiker rosa
---
Ya want a gameplay with that?
---
Yeah but in late game you are not gonna have 15 seconds but you will have a free respawn with 8bit.
---
Thank you!
---
Man my grandma can draw better
---
#BRush
---
love it!
---
And how often does that happen? Because the shelly has to be retarded if she hasn't enough react time to press ONE button before you finish her.
---
And that only happens if you are a literally on top of her, otherwise half of your shots will fail and she will kill you.
---
atleast you have mythics
---
When a Bull sees a Shelly.*
---
She has more range than you, and can chase you down/outrange you if you try to chase her.
---
We know
---
Dude wtf
---
Poor bibi she has lost her eyes. Btw its a cool skin i guess
---
just wait. someday it will be available as 59 gem offer.
---
Go to a doctor, Show him the post and symptoms

---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/cv8kkg/the_assassins_territory/
---
Also, normal respawning is NOT instant and on the same place as you started and seeing as 8bit has a low movement speed, this saves you about 25 seconds in gem grab, bounty etc and 20 seconds in sd
---
The coordination is beautiful, the bounces; stunning, and those angles are just bewildering
---
Gene ranked #1 in range and his super is top #5 in the game. Like crow and spike gene has a high skill cap and if you are a good player he‚Äôs one of the best brawlers. He just hasn‚Äôt got any buffs and other brawlers did. Look at Brock and Piper. Even Rico second sp is really good. So gene was really strong on release but not so much lately. My theory is intact
---
i know, im still shocked to this day.
---
Good? Its one of the best remodels so far.
---
One of the best drawings i've ever seen.
---
I am making a brawl stars meme video.
---
Can I use your meme? I will credit you
---
Unlike penny tho, 8 bit is slower, can only try that one time, doesn't even have a chance to try that if he got killed once before and if he doesn't succeed he is starpowerless for the rest of the game. And even if I am predicting the actual strength of him in siege wrong, the strength of the starpower will still be extremely different depending on the mode and will still be hard to balance, which was my main point of my omment
---
Maybe his Pay to Win
---
Thanks!
---
Its good! But water in BB is forbidden
---
Your post has been removed, make sure to use the body of a post to elaborate on the title.
---
He‚Äôs just looking for attention shut up about it and ignore him.
---
Tick has longer range and your super ‚Äòranking‚Äô is 100% your opinion, and if you‚Äôll ask more people other than me, they‚Äôll say that Gene was underpowered upon release, and that he‚Äôs very strong/OP right now.
---
Lmao
---
Maybe except Rosa, she could be like she was after her first nerf
---
I couldn't agree more
---
Rather have that shark leon skin
---
Bandaid + 8-bit = Extra life
---
Shark Leon killed her
---
You are 7k? I‚Äôm at 11k, I need Leon, crow, and the mythics. You are very lucky!
---
Can i get the link when you finish uploading the video? I just love brawl stars memes
---
HmmmüòÇ
---
If you die early you also get a second life lol
---
Upvote cause Carl
---
We're having a casual convo
---
Toxic
---
Well. We'll see on reddit on future posts who was right. But the only fact that one brawler can take down a safe all by himself is extremely broken on paper.
---
What is your legendary chance in box?
---
Anotgef name for it leon 4.0 first leon second rosa third shelly w bandaid and now 8 bit with 1 up
---
Yeah me too but i dont cry.
---
It is relased,he is just invisible for now.üòÄ
---
Me
---
What gets more karma. Positive lies. Or negative truth. Idk. Hey awesome play!!!
---
Too difficult
---
yeah honestly that solves 99% of the issues with it. he'd die along with the booster in like 3 seconds after respawn
---
I can see it being OP in brawl ball too, if you die near the other teams goal you can just run in their goal with invincibility
---
I think piper is not good in brawl ball, and anyway I hate brawl ball, I love showdown because I can win more cups,bye bye
---
He can only do it once a game. So if you kill him then you are fine
---
Bruh I‚Äôve been waiting for shiba Nita for like ten years
---
r/shittybrawlstars Supercell doesn't give you brawlers, it's the RNG
---
## bruh üôåüôåüí™üòùü§§

The turret thing if it did splash damage would fix it also for the 8bit pam combo
---
Go on the official brawl stars youtube channel. It‚Äôs crawling with people complaining
---
Deffinetly a pro player
---
I like jokes
---
Yes. Kill him one and he starpower is useless for a rest of the game.
---
The video himself is not really that funny. But how you say it makes me laughing really really hard. Great post.
---
Thanks for your comment! I know there are way too many bushes but that's the main theme for the map like Snake Prairie.
---
okay
---
Of course the 100gems.
---
Bruh I opened 5mega boxes and I still don‚Äôt have any brawler above super rare
---
Salute ur eyes man
---
Agree i couldn't more
---
Its joke bro dont be so mean
---
this makes me want to quit the game. i am really dissatisfied with the recent updates
---
I wonder what would happen if the 8-Bit boss had his star power... ü§î
---
It‚Äôs all a good idea until a newbie locks his boxes then complains about a glitch.
---
Maybe make it so when you tap it, it tells you how to fix it?
---
F
---
Yeah and races are a re-color of white people but we still care enought about them to include them in art
---
K thx...i thought people would really be so dumb...XD
---
Bruh repost
---
There are already. In fact, they're more common than those with.
---
I didn't even take a screenshot from the game, I just googled "Gene" lmao. Still, I don't have him :(.
---
What part of that paragraph was badly written?
---
Yes it does if you‚Äôre this endgame
---
Extra life
---
Ahh, I see what the problem is. You must not be unlocking brawl boxes as it says 'Open Brawl Boxes to unlock'. Please open one brawl box at your earliest convenience; that should fix your problem.
---
Uh it says power 4 so how do you have the star power
---
"No that's not what I said" typically when someone throws insults without any rebuttal it means that they have lost so I just wanted confirmation lol.
---
"Try reading next time" I can read, and I did, I just made an inference. Learn what to say next time.
---
"You proved my theory when u reacted the way u did" didnt know crushing u in a debate meant that I was a bad person lol. Even though I proved u wrong.
---
Yeah. They know how to keep community exalted.
---
you idiot, in beta, like 2 years ago, trophies didnt matter and you get all bralwers form boxes you dum dum
---
You did not prove me wrong? You made it even worse? A 10 yo saying this kind of dumb shit okay... a 22yo??
---
Nah, I just played like ten games, mid was intact.
---
EEEEL PRIMOOOO!!!!!!
---
Thats probably bc everyone plays 8bit rn
---
top 10 cursed images
---
Poor barley
---
oh, at 4k i had all the epics and 2 mythics (im not bragging or anything, im just saying) btw your really lucky that you have spike, he is really good but i dont have him
---
For sure! Not to mention he could of used one auto to kill the 8bit tower and then 8bit wouldn't even of been able to 1 shot him.
---
The other two people were pre teamed
---
"You did not prove me wrong" you guessed at my age and trophy range and was way off the mark. And I gave a rebuttal to all of your comments.
---
"A 10 yrs old saying this shit..ok, but a 22 yrs old." Didnt know debunking u was something a 22 yrs old cant do and it offended u.
---
And they will continue, but in every match there were like 3 Shelly's average.
---
Room it was duo
---
I was clapping with the luchador dude when game released
---
Yeah Mortis invented the word rockabilly
---
i have thought about that skin before 8-bit got relased.
---
btw. supercell:band-aid nerf,extra life.
---
Look at the top right idiot
---
Excuse me WTF
---
i was rhe same , well i didn't get any brawler above super rare until 4.900 . i got leon from a brawl box , then piper , pan and then crow from a free box from shop and
---
the losing glitch still works, but only once.
---
These posts are old. They‚Äôve gotten annoying
---
r/animefeet
---
is a shit &gt;:|
---
Damn you matchmaking
---
Me too, but how did you put Nita near your username
---
Not having to walk all the way back up from the usual spawn point to the middle or top of the map again, but instead respawning right on the spot, *and* with no wait time, is far from useless. Especially with a slow-ass brawler like 8 Bit.
---
If you think this offend me you really need to get social contact and a life. I guessed you were 10 which is not a good thing... im just gonna go to sleep now bc im done with this stupid discussion and I have school in 8 hours (if it makes you feel better than you may believe you‚Äôre right no one will agree but ok)
---
Penny also has no skin
---
They should make a certain game modes with mods that include being able to use all available brawler‚Äôs star power (e.g. Shelly being able to use shell shock and band-aid)
---
I honestly can't tell if you're being sarcastic
---
Translation: ‚ÄúYou have better things to do than be a fat virgin!‚Äù
---
Maybe his new animation is him flexing his muscles
---
the chances mean skill... if you are skilled you have a higher chance. For example, you might see somewhere (as you did with sp on losing team statistic) that the chances for getting a hole in one in gulf are 1/x. If you‚Äôre good, obviously, the chances go up.
---
So true was gonna type exactly that .. man dash with his speed star power ..take my updoot

i'm pretty sure that this is probs your own most insane week, not of all. if we talking all insane weeks yours isn't even in the top 10000

Dammit I can‚Äôt believe I fell for that

They have ways to nerf it. They could make him take longer to spawn, reduce his invulnerability, make him spawn at spawn, slow him after spawning. Trust me there is a way to nerf it
---
At least give credits to the user

You can shoot on between the supers. Bull unloads faster than shelly.

I think that he wants to say that he has no luck, comparing himself to this 2k account with spike. But in my opinion, before and since the balance trophies update, reach 7k tr is really easy. So you don't really deserve/need a legendary tbh...

---
Well that wasn't really funny tbh, but whatever
---
Me three
---
If you both kill each other, unless you are both the same brawler it's very rare you killed each other at the same time. Usually one of you got the kill first but the other had already shot a bullet before they died, causing both brawlers to die, yet one still dies first
---
Dumbass
---
I.......disagree
---
I didn‚Äôt realize so many ppl above me didn‚Äôt have rare stuff. My friends have everything and their free to play and at like 7.5k. Thank you sir. You have opened my eyes to my fortune.üôè
---
This is just playing with word still the same star power
---
Man you are good with dinamike
---
Rip
---
Lol you are joking
---
1) destroy the super turret
---
2) go behind any wall. Tick is so slow
---
3) heal up
---
4) win because you have 11 power ups
---
Nobody will see it coming until it's too late
---
Good Job! Your bull already have Star power?! I only got a Star power on 7k! And God's job again!
---
Yeah, but then it's over, you only get to use it once per match, and you don't even get to choose, so the first time it's used it gets used up, not OP IMO
---
What you put apon this cursed land
---
Unless you died once in the match already
---
thank you!! i expected to get some heat because bull is "the easiest brawler to use" but never the less i'm still proud :)
---
Nice job!
---
Believe or not. I am.
---
Even worse than band-aid
---
Yes...? It makes the star power name way cooler than it is currently.
---
Hit 'em with that moonwalk
---
there are people who have been playing for 2 years, above 15k trophies who don't have any legendaries. yup, very normal
