Okay man. Just to let you know I‚Äôve never called OJ stupid, I called the act of throwing the super at nothing stupid. Call me an ass all you want but I should still be able to have an opinion.

Nice, I can really feel the passion in your art. 420/69

Thanks you too!

Same and same. I already have 5 brawlers up to 500 and I need 5 more to get Night Mecha Crow
---
Play whatever you want to play. All modes will make you more skillful at the game. I suggest winning a game in each mode at least once, because they‚Äôll offer you a star token.
---
Remember when in beta people were complaining about how bad this map is, then when Supercell removed it they were all like ‚ÄúOMG WHY DID YOU REMOVE HOT MAZE SUPERCELL??!?!?!‚Äù

This is creepy

Yeah 20 minutes ago
---
Absolutely
---
I agree!! I find it frustrating because I've experienced a lot of times that I get teamed up with a really good player, but we lose anyway because of the opposing got lucky at the last minute.
---
THANK YOU!!!
---
I played in the Canada early release version of brawl and I got most of the brawlers. It was an amazing time with Bo and the only legendary crow. That was good time
---
"How I feel like when I play mortis"

I just hope Supercell addresses this issue and does something about it.
---
The Mortis needs to have no hat.
---
Wait... Bibi is a boy?!
---
Yes!
---
Bull: Excuse me sir, May I see some IDs
---
I'd be ok with that plus the bushes in the middle will help out a little. Also it would be cool to see a more long range showdown map

Yeah but I bet that nobody is gonna make memes out of him

I'm not saying he's not good, but there is a limit to being good, especially when it's just 1 good players, and it's high trophies. Even when the best players in the world at bb play bb with randoms, they find it hard to carry, when they aren't going for the hardest of the hardest of trickshots. Also players like this don't go for trickshots like this at all, because it's so inconsistent and would mean losses.
---
Eyyy i seen this on BSA!

If you just spread those ass cheeks, you will see.

You forgot randoms

She has tiddies and a boy voice but in the retropolis trailer it kinda sounds like a boy
---
If OJ didn‚Äôt yell as much in his videos I think that would make his videos better. Yelling is ok when it makes sense, like a super close game or getting a legendary out of a free chest, but not at every given opportunity

Now see I think that‚Äôs what gets me, all the people setting records and getting really high in the past had to really work hard for it, and we shouldn‚Äôt have to do taht shit again just to not get passed by people who played like only 50% as much as we did
---
Maybe including random in the wording doesn't help, or my wording was bad. It'd be more like a narrower firing pattern like Pam's shot, with a fixed firing pattern.
---
Yeah.... I don‚Äôt want this

---
What's the river for?  You do know Peoplr can just jump over it right?  (Dina-Jump)

it would still be bad because single shots of colt do small amounts of damage, and he would have to come closer to deal full damage which means death, but thx for explaining
---
just representing a line
---
The real trick shot here
---
upgrade and play everyone till lvl 5, then when you have a better understanding of the game, pick your favorite brawler and upgrade him to lvl 9 asap (it will take a while anyway). Then repeat. 
---
Coins are hard to come by so don't waste them on daily offers, just in the brawler that you're focused on.
---
Modern day Babe Ruth, you‚Äôre a pitcher and a hitter

Crow, a legendary, has less health and damage than colt, a common... lmaoooo seems balanced

And you just showed how I am right. Stop with all the shitty memes, they aren't even original or creative, but all the other kids the sub upvote them because they are stupid.
---
Now don't cry when Supercell doesn't listen to what you ask, because you deserve it. Just look how you ruined the community, there is a reason Supercell doesn't listen as much as it would, and it is because it isn't worth it when they see kids using overused templates and jokes
---
Ah shit, here we go again
---
It‚Äôs because the hat
---
I think I have seen this meme
---
How much will power MUST YOU HAVE to get Brock to 500 and then tilt him all the way back to 69?Thats some dedication to the joke

Ah, yes. Didn't think of that. In that case, unlucky for them.
---
And this shitty and overused post again...

a bull quote from a colt flair ü§î

No power cubes is that intended because if it is that is good because it makes players rely on skill not power cubes

And one for you

The trading is real

i'd save for the 49 gem mega box offer
---
I didn't asked anything.. I'm happy with the game right now... The trohpy balances made me even happier...And btw if I'm a kid and let's say that you're an adult how you're making the kids from thsi community stupid? Come on, tell me.
---
The trades are real
---
Shhhh im undercover
---
Low effort post.
---
And one more time, you don't have any idea about the state of the game. Just shut up, kid, and keep making your shitty "Humor" posts, I will be checking you to see what I can post in r/shittybrawlstars (probably every single post you make)

bro i think its called teaming

Full moat

??
---
Outlaw colt is a recolor of Rockstar colt
---
500 starpts = 30 gems
---
so 50.000 is just two ceros more
---
so 50k are 3000 gems 
---
ridiculous..
---
also your calculations are correct
---
It's really cluttered which could be confusing
---
Time to change my flair for the TENTH TIME

literally the golden skins are like usable trophies because they aren‚Äôt cooler like the another mecha‚Äôs..

Holy... I can't even beleive that you're an adult, you're insulting... Well you're not an adult such more like a hater.

It was funny for a while, but ya know, memes gotta die, and this one has just lived too long.
---
Did you just call Rosa a man, man?
---
I wouldnt like this map tbh because you would get pinched right away
---
No, it wasn‚Äôt funny because it just ruins the joke

Everyone raids Turkey to get free legendaries - WITH SKINS

Everyone to their own opinion

Man i cant undeestand gow peaple get gold mecha piper skin
---

---
And another shitty and low effort post... Is it too difficult to add the joke in the image and not in the title? Adding it in the title makes it look even more shitty
---
All I'm saying is that if they played smartly they could have won or get a tie. Of course it's primos fault that they lost but you gotta see the big picture
---
I would try turning off your wifi and using mobile network. For me it's more stable, and consumes almost no data.
---
Band aid is useful only when you survive for a long time.
---
In any 3v3 matches you have higher chance of dieing so it's op in all game mode but it's ultra op in showdown
---
Your username... How old you? üòë

this guy got 4k karma for this
---
Sometimes I do it on brawl ball, because making the bull waste his ammo can give the time to my teammates score the goal. And placing the turret close to a tank can make he attack your turret and not your teammate ( because normally they auto aim)
---
Why do i think that bibi is like bull sister.

---
Yeah, i was specifically thinking about #5. Every single post has these kins of comments. People asking for 30 gem skins and for free stuff
---
The problem with tickets is that you have to get at least 30 tokens to make it more profitable than token doublers.. And that is way too hard unless you have a good team
---
So the best option for me is still the tokens
---
You mean brawl ball.....?

Weeb gang approves

I really want to put a transformer theme song here but i can't.

WTF 50% of the ppl say Shelly is the worst brawler and the other 50% say shd needs a nerf u haters decide altho supercell are smart so they don't give a sh1t to things like nerfing Shelly. What do u want, u crying babies? That Shelly super's damage will be reduced to 1? It's fucking ur problem that u don't check bushes or can't kill a lil Shelly
---
OR A BETTER IDEA: USE SHELLY U DUMBASSES SHE'S THE STARTING BRAWLER!
---
Lex hasnt changed that much üòÇ
---
Its nkt your drawing that is bad... But the monster that you drew.
---
Oof ouch my ketchup
---
Fun fact: I have a friend called Colt :D
---
Nice work, it's always nice to see Rosa completely outplayed. That brawler is still wonky.

Not as pro as auto aiming Bull's super
---
NOT GOOD
---
Aye, you got me on that one
---
Bibi is cute though, but if possible, please change Mortis to DynaüòÅüòÅ
---
Ik conclusion, my dick hard
---
He has a really long range, and is a really good brawler try to max him out with your elixir, his super takes a little bit to land but otherwise he is a really fun brawler
---
Holy moly! So cool, please make more

Dude, i am 13.4k and i can say this update cater 30 percent to endgame players and 70% to pull back old players from crying when they lose. It doesnt take skill to go up, now just way more time which i dont like. Premieum skins should display your skills in getting it not, oh look. I spent 2 years  just grinding

Ah but its still not cool I take back what I said when u posted the 1 piper vs 9 Shellys post... I said it was epic, but the teaming make it to look horrible and it's not a real strategy the name of the mode is "SOLO SHOWDOWN" not "2v8 showdown"
---
Can u link the original if possible?

Oh wow the quality of that video is so great

What?

Don't worry the more boxes you open , the higher chances for you to unlock a new brawler. You will definitely get them soon!
---
Yea, usually I roll then use my shotguns, but when I get close that 212 damage from her attack (at close range) somehow charges her super. Then she hops away while I‚Äôm blown to smitherens. Leaving only a powercube left.

Well you did not woosh me lol
---
They should make a skin for Rico, Brock, and Dynamike that looks like there old models or have a resemblance to them and call them the classics like what Gemikoni said
---
I don't get I T
---
Deserves more likes
---
This drawing is my idea:)
---
Mah brilliant plan worked
---
Y-pose
---
Well done! I can see supercell doing this as a skin, but probably not adding the crown. Would definitely buy!
---
Where's wonderbrad lmao
---
Nice,I don‚Äôt even know the name of the bird that I see everyday
---
Yeah already try
---
Super clutch, Nice!

Why u cryin lol

Quite true, I always get killed by gemmers and teamers.
---
Ik but when will you really use soilder in a meme?
---
What‚Äôs it look like and I can probably tell you it. Is it mainly gray and move it‚Äôs neck while walking?

Poco was broken just before the global realise
---
Not too high though

Miss it and i loved to play nita on that map throw the bear in and they can't do much, i was 10th with nita that season

Colt has slick boots causing him to run fast like scout

Who will us THE SOILDER in a meme?

I agree but I‚Äôm stupid

---
nice
---
wrong
---
No because then people would just start false reporting like on clash of clans. Just grow some skin. People will always troll You think I don't get mad at, for example, Dynamike and Barley players just because they love to camp out and destroy everyone else with ease? No reason to report.
---
And tell me - what IS your definition of "trolling" in this game?
---
Which means it heals him too!!
---
Lol wth

What do they think the game is?

Thats we're He came from, this mine

This looks like something an angry 12 year old would do thinking that brawl stars is a ripoff of some crappy game they play

Mark my words ashen one , you remain among the accursed
---
Review the top 5 most big boned brawlers in Brawl Stars
---
SO REMOVE YOUR DOWNVOTE RIGHT NOW
---
Fair enough but it could make certain scenarios unfair if a player gets unlucky or if teaming is big on this map
---
Its from like a few months ago I just remember to concept not the post
---
Ik
---
but it gives many opportunities in case you lack brawlers in an account that you use but nevertheless you have them in an account that you hardly use is a great advantage.
---
Ok because you used a Brock quote you get an upvote
---
Yeah I know a Leon
---
 I say they must learn our peaceful ways, by force!
---
Rico is common?
---
very high effort meme keep it upüëç
---
I do this all the time only because i knew he was gunna get this star power...i keep thinking i have it...always disappointed

Hello operator, I'd like to report a bruh moment

Man he‚Äôs just being fair

I hot Leon at 2k
---
On the skins now, colt mcccoy
---
Np its a good meme, just 1 thing was wrong. Have a nice day
---
You don't need to play it if it's shit
---
Talk is cheap!
---
Spread the seed and need for speed
---
No ur lying
---
Yeah that too
---
No it didn't? He just had insane range and higher damage. It's the little changes that make such a big difference
---
Ottoman empire?
---
Hes not wrong at all at least you should have free star points at end of season but supercell is never willing to negotiate looks like their fans got a bit infamous (did you got the reference?)
---
Still less broken than Shelly and her bandaid
---
Probably bc he's good in SD.
---
Mortis sucks, but he was my 2nd 500.
---
this is the bet thing ever
---
Smh you forgot about night witch mortis  being the original

Hello

You were surprised to find out that a new skin was coming?

---
People who use light mode.
---
Really tired of seeing "who does this, who uses that" everywhere online. Obviously there are people that do things.
---
Judging by the comment section this is an unpopular opinion but IMO Poco's current star power is great and is probably better than his new one
---
To break it down, Poco's original star power heals teammates for 500 while attacking, hence making him what is one of the best brawlers in the game for gem grab, both annoying to deal with due to his insane coverage with his attack and now his added ability to heal teammates as long as they stay in front of him and in range, thus dealing damage and healing at the same time
---
On the other hand, his new star power only does 1.2k damage, despite the range and hit through walls, it's too underwhelming to be useful in most modes, especially 3v3, when normally u would much rather heal ur teammates, who 70% of the time are on your left or right, hence it won't deal damage at all, while in showdown this range won't matter if Poco's original damage and range can't fight against longer range brawlers like Brock, Piper and Colt, making it obsolete if the only damage u can deal is 1.2k by using ur super.
---
Then again this is just my own take on it :)
---
Cool, I love the idea and the creativity
---
I like to have the auto night mode at 7PM
---
Brock should have 4th closet
---
This looked better before
---
How?
---
Is the app only for ios?
---
i have 25k gold and the sp's dont even come up in my shop its so annoying
---
You deserve an award by the way my last post talk about the same thing lol

I used Piper as base to make how Otis would look in game. Read my comment, Otis is male and is a character from a movie

Not really. It‚Äôs usually just middle-aged/elders who have that name now

Thats a completely different map

so ?
---
Same goes for me buddy
---
Colt is an uncommon name. The gun was named after the guy
---
I may be friendly, but I ain‚Äôt that dumb. I know you are very used to just killing us off, but promise me, we can be friends and have our kinds be at peace if we both work together. I‚Äôll even buy you dinner. What do you say, pal?
---
True but you forgot "buff mortis" and "destroying these teamers" on a 1 v 2 situation with no power cubes on their side
---
mama squeeze ma balls
---
CARL
---
Their is a wizard rico wow and never knew he existed oh wait...
---
imagine running away from a fight with 1k hp left only to see a poco kill u through a wall
---
how is that trolling ?
---
I can‚Äôt wait to jump people with Mortis‚Äô new star power
---
I‚Äôm old enough of a player to know that Demise once ruled the global leaderboard. Is that good?
---
You destroy the tnt, It explodes barriers
---
That might actually be the case. A skin was leaked in the game files titled ‚ÄúHog Rider Carl‚Äù that hasn‚Äôt been mentioned by supercell yet. Perhaps that might be the reward?
---
Why does it say new epic brawler
---
YEeT
---
how many trophies and brawlers do you have ?
---
I like that
---
The rarities are so screwed up
---
Omg this is c00l. Hope no insta normies will steal it
---
This person doesn‚Äôt know what supercell is
---
But your forget, that dinamike + barley gangs = teamer gang
---
I became Tick before you üòú
---
is there another way? I cant pull this off w/my friends

God someone telled me that they gonna change brawlball and mortis will sucks lol

It's Sans?

Darryl gets his back over time if he hits anyone or not. I still agree that it‚Äôs only really viable with mike though.
---
Ik but if a lot of them had that...
---
Not a health or damage buff,But more of a reload speed buff,Most of the community agrees on the reload buff being the best way to go w/o making him OP
---
I‚Äôm not a fan of the choke points on the corners of the inner square (one tile seems too dangerous imo), but I like your thinking.

I didn't notice pocos was there

Stole this accout and crate new for him. STONKS

Leon is always wearing the hoodie he doesn't need a closet. Plus he probably leaves it on his bed anyways.

Yeah, but the Mecha skins you can buy with gems are Mecha Crow (blue, like in this picture) and Mecha Bo (orange)

üòîI was waiting for tick flair since the update

It could be from spike as it could b√© from my ass üòÇ

Omfg I thought i was the only one that notice when it was found out

Read rules. One of them is Speak English

This was stolen from the guy who made 'every brawler drawn by mortis'

Right

Wow

almost commented repost but saw the joke

---
Wtf is this. You trying to DDOS
---
LOVE THE CONCEPT. I‚Äôd like to play this map if it gets added to Brawl Stars. To be honest, the corner right above need some more details though. I see what you did there, with the curly stuff if you what I mean. But it‚Äôa just a little bit off. The other 3 biomes are G.R.E.A.T. Keep on going. I‚Äôll follow you to take a look at other upcoming maps (you‚Äôll make more won‚Äôt you?? If not, please make more!!!) and maybe you can improve this map with my tip. Nice work!
---
And I don't have a legendary at 11k...
---
Can i be ur third morti friend?
---
nah.
---
The fish reminds me of Mario
---
I mentioned Rico and Brock aswell, but I do think if an anniversary was to come out that classic skins would be nice
---
Not True, with piper you did aim with its super
---
it was more than other brawlers werent as strong. As theyve buffed other brawlers and added cool new op ones poco has remained fairly untouched.
---
NO
---
How do you know about the other 2?! And yes
---
I know him, I think that he released the credits
---
bruh you just sent us in a loop
---
Tick's reload time is 15% shorter.
---
*sees tentacle*
---
I think we all know where this is going
---
User, mode, map. Depends on a lot. Both are extremely useful. Being able to one shot a ton of brawlers with demolition is very handy in bounty.

It's a private server

If it dies in new, there is a reason

Make it so that only Jesse is viable.

listen i dont even understand what you're trying to say anymore

listen, if you dislike this post so much, ill kindly delete it. i was just happy atm that i didnt die to some scumbag.

Wow, nice job

I already have a lvl 5 Spike from the summer offer and his skin so stealing it to use it wouldn‚Äôt help me BUT I could sell it to obtain S T O N K S.
---
Stop whining about the trophy change, if you buy a candy today and the next day they have a 50% discount you dont go whining to them right?
---
not trying to win, trying to steal it
---
So Colt's a jerk for trying to win? You tried to win as well. Does that make you a jerk?
---
Yeah, win
---
Thanks üòä
---
Why such an asshole? I mean you can go ahead and deny the facts that I put right in front of your face, that's your choice buddy, but just because you didn't experience it doesn't mean it never existed.

why everyone gotta oversimplify it

Getting banned for false reporting also exists

Darryl!

stop oversimplifying things omfg

In my opinion if you are good evading demolition is more useful

how do you make maps?

How did I oversimplify anything? Why don't you tell me why Colt is a jerk?

HEY HEY.... it‚Äôs all we got we got nerfed we are weak were tired.... don‚Äôt say just nerf it please it‚Äôs all we basically need at this point

Ah right so it had to do with that, thanks I was just wondering if that was the case,
---
Spike
---
For a second I thought it said you have 700 total trophies

Bruh wut?

That leons are noobs, really bad at aiming and boosted trophies by trophy patch.

You‚Äôre welcome I guess

Unfortunately not... we actually don‚Äôt have the tools the remove it from your account. I‚Äôve seen players with similar problems and I‚Äôve tried to check if there‚Äôs any way to ‚Äúsolve‚Äù this, but I‚Äôm afraid we can‚Äôt do much at the moment... sorry about that. :/
---
My advice for you would be... embrace the skin and be the best mecha crow that ever lived. :D
---
Adding a third confirmation button seems a simple solution, but I‚Äôve been in games where we actually done that and we basically upset all the rest of our players that didn‚Äôt ask for that, hahah. Not a pretty scenario if you ask me :D
---
Poco!!!
---
Impossibru
---
I just love dogs :L im not sure is it balanced as well and srry for bad drawings i spent more time trying to balance it and make it fit into game not that much on the drawings. Im pretty sure Supercell have awesome developers which can make him look beautiful if they gonna add it so :D

Dark souls reference?

fk u got me

Very accurate
---
Flair checks out with vid
---
‚ÄúQuit your greediness and give us free stuff‚Äù i dont know if i should laugh or cringe, also its a free fucking game, how does this kid not know they also have to make money not just do everything for free, you can also get a lot of skins and gems without paying

Guessing tomorrow, along with mecha dyna.

Last time they had a hype video for crow and spike their skins were in the shop the next day.

I‚Äôm thinking make it last 3.5 Seconds but only protect from 60% damage. A little trade off

Forget got to text its not

awwwwwwwwwwwwwwww

Ah I see, that makes sense. Well thanks so much for the lightning quick response!

I‚Äôve done this to 20 trophies with Bo, shelly, crow, and colt because I was bored. But what‚Äôs even more impressive is there was this guy who tilted all the brawlers in the game at the time to 20 trophies rank 20

bruh
---
Yeah you change your phone every game you play, and you buy one that cost 500-1000$, not everyone has money to pay in that...
---
Brock Rosa Pam and Piper r pretty common names
---
&gt; But his second can scale with power cubes
---
Only star powers that are percentage based scale with power cubes.
---
This is my favourite part of gem grab. I push high all game whilst letting the Bois get the goods and then do everything I can to keep them at bay.
---
It seems like you lost your  virginity.....
---
It's really nice when people do this, but not when they interrupt and steal your gems for glory, die and give up the gems, and then leave you with 9 gems and the enemy with 8. It's annoying.
---
a can confirm this is a thing
---
Crow has 6 skins Bo has 3 barley and Brock have 4
---
Cuz the color variations of Mecha skins count too
---
I like how the sign says "Photography Is Prohibited" but Rico and Barley takes a selfie anyways.
---
I know i am Late, but Is Pico Supposed to mean Poco Or Rico?
---
There is no brawler in your game over 400. If you had used primo, you‚Äôd have the replay. 400 brawler has to be in the game.
---
You need 400 trophies on the specific brawler you play with
---
Piper and Primo remodels anyone?
---
I am ridiculously amazing
---
Hmm I see, but most people dont know that Darryl is a Rolling Assassin
---
wtf
---
I‚Äôd buy it
---
Thank you...that is the kind of feedback i was expecting ahah
---
Can‚Äôt go wrong either way. Even at full price, it‚Äôs a great value. I don‚Äôt have the patience to wait, but obviously it‚Äôs better value on sale.
---
You need to have 400 trophies with the brawler you are playing Or someone in you matche needs to play a brawler with more than 400 trophies. So if play with your primo he will get replay but Dina don't.

Colt is named after a gun company which is named after a person: Samuel Colt.

Also Piper and Rosa are probably more common than Penny.

Dude I understand it's not that simple getting a new phone but we are talking about Brawl Stars, not something like Pubg or COD.
---
The devs can't hold back the game that hard. Even 4-years-old phones can run the game somewhat smoothly (We are talking about 150$ ones).
---
I mean well I just thought for every brawler you would get to see a new box so it‚Äôs cooler but that too

It would love this.  It would make buying brawlers more fun.  The only downside of buying brawlers is the lack of satisfaction, but this would fix that!
---
Oh, that's cool.
---
Yes R.I.P

Piper always has his eyes closed in game, but in his icon she has only one eye open

In terms of how hard it is to programme.... 
---
Of course they could assign a refund code to each individual skin but that will be very long 
---
Or creating a new paragraph of codes to make a new variable 
---
And then a new paragraph for the refund button 
---
Then actually initiating the code to the skins 
---
Then actually programming how the variable changes 
---
Then having to state the number of gems of all skins to the variable 
---
Then having the whole refund option 
---
So...
---
yes, but with bandaid shellys hes not viable

I‚Äôm a globalist and I approve. Can I flex my 15K trophies after the purge and say I care as much as a beta player? (I know it‚Äôs not super high anymore but I play with tops often enough I feel important xD)

God, this post is so shitty

I've noticed a few of those things such as "being pinned" or being halted while moving or firing. Half of my brawlers are 500 plus so when it happens I watch the replay...it usually doesnt show the event during the replay. It also odd that I can go on a multi game win streak but soon as I'm about to rank up I lose many many trophies in a row...I dont change the way I play so maybe it's just coincidence..or maybe its not.
---
Honestly though...

The robot spikes in the game are the ones from the big spike which is y there r multiple

Well all it takes is one 18K to read that and they‚Äôll give me hell to no end. üòÇ I just don‚Äôt like grinding meaninglessly, it‚Äôs a waste of my life. But I enjoy the gameplay.
