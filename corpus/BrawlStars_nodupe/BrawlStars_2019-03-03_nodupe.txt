He‚Äôs is a throw pick on brawl ball now.  And yeah he is one of the best, especially in gem grab.  He won‚Äôt be able to take out a Pam, but if your teammates get her to 3000 you can easily kill her, take the gems and win the game, as well as other brawlers.  
---
But if a highly reactive chemical is inadequate tube and is thrown it could explode. Peppers exploding still doesn't make sense but it's a game so

If only there was a fifth slot that doesn‚Äôt have an event for 5/7 days in a week, that could serve as a slot for showdown with event modifiers. Well, I wish there was an simple solution.
---
Seriously though, the weekend event slot should be used for showdown with modifiers during the weekdays and then have the ticket events during the weekends.

They need to just make each spawnable have a set amount of hits required instead of HP. Like 4 hits so one player can't just solo it quickly on a full reload, but still make it easy enough that it doesn't sit there as a 4th player for a full minute. Buffs it against it's biggest weakness(throwers) but nerfs it against everything else, yet in a fair way.
---
This is a dope idea! 
---
Can't say exactly, my experience was limited to this single episode.  
---
I guess if you're an expert Mortis you can last longer, but 3-4 mins should be a standard I guess. 8 mins may means bad players or simply not so coordinated.

Ummm actually it's average...

for Piper yes, for them it's over XD
---
I am in the exact same boat but have had the brawlers i have maxed for some time like 5ish months and i am missing spike leon and gene its annoying because im f2p and i cant get any new brawlers im also at 9.4k trophies
---
I wish I had an epic or mythic 
---
Oooh there's not much poco stuff I think I might have a few guesses. Is it Hawaiian poco or heavy metal poco(rockstar poco).

This was all very cool information! Thanks!

Why did you even search soundtracks from Dragon City? Knowing Supercell, they will probably sew Dragon City for some money.

Highly suggest you watch Kairos video on teaming. And anyone else that hasn‚Äôt seen it 
---
I was able to push crow to 500.
---
this is really cool and I really want this. I want to play with my friends but I can't risk losing trophies as they are kind of bad. The only way to play with them without risking trophies is playing with new brawlers :(

Absolutely the worst combo

So many brawl ball wins

I agree, it's not balanced

not really, sure you can autoaim for the quick damage, but there are still times where breaking the walls or environments prevail in the long run

This is literally one of the best, game changer
---
The skull section is kinda trash because you‚Äôd need to destroy all of the ones in the path you wanna move...
---
that bow has really bad aim
---
Mortis is totally useless in every mode because of landscape. I think you got real lucky or you ground all day..
---
P.S. lol your name is Autoaim... so technically auto-aim got the trophies
---
This only applies to legendarys, basically if you dont unbox a legendary ur chances start going up until u unbox a brawler.
---
Note that depending on the brawler rarity will lower your chance by a diff amount
---
Who? He's just not as useful as before
---
maybe not have the bushes connected, this promotes bush camping, which ruins the experience of 3v3 games

Digo a mesma coisa que est√° no post mas relacionado a oferta de boas vindas e n√£o os 3 brawlers m√≠ticos. Sou um jogador F2P
---
It‚Äôs not supercells they are not multiple companies
---
Yeah not showing stats is the best way to keep people playing. Otherwise people just get shitty about playing with players that don't have great stats
---
the enemy really needed a frank
---
It's a cool concept. A Island. But the bushes destroys it.
---
And... All the non-tanks brawlers teams with each other in higher trophies, it's a hell...
---
it would be unplayable with those gray, boring ass, NOT RED gogles. ( bring back the gogles)
---
So basically what I get from this is that dynamike is very bad in the meta
---
If there is an object or enemy behind the walls, then yes it can grab them but if there is nothing, then his super should allow him to grab onto the walls to pull away from danger. I don‚Äôt think this would be a buff since if there is a bush behind the wall and there is someone there, then gene would unfortunately grab the enemy (Bull) leading to death...

Oh. You should try it. On paper they're comparable
---
I think it's worst with a Robo Boss... The bushes take a long space of the map, with a robot following you then... It's 100‚ÑÖ death. 
---
At least with Meteors, I could push my Crow lvl 4 to 500, 
---
well at least the frank knows how to play...
---
when you get ambushed by a bull in a bush:
---
Oh damn.... 1000IQ
---
Nobody would agree with you in saying Mortis is useless now, there are solutions to auto aim such as retreating chip damage and good positioning. I didn‚Äôt get lucky all the way up to 237 at lvl 1.
---
He also has some of the same voice lines as a robo boss
---
justice for showdown
---
Ok maybe your at a higher lvl than me so it‚Äôs different for you but I never have a problem with her.

---
Haha thanks #stopthespin #buffcrow 
---
During beta teaming was a pretty big deal in Showdown, and a bunch of youtubers started a #StopTheSpin campaign. This was one of those cases where the minority speaks the loudest, and in the end modifiers were added with the stated purpose of stopping teaming. The first implementation was simple: Slot 1 was normal Gem Grab, Slot 2 was normal Showdown, Slot 3 rotated between Heist, Brawl Ball and Bounty, and Slot 4 rotated between all five gamemodes with modifiers. They initially planned to have modifiers in ALL showdown games, but backlash from the community following the early access youtuber footage led to slot 2 being normal. The big problem with this was that modifiers are EXTREMELY rng heavy. Imagine heist where the enemy bull happens to get a power juice spawn on his side just as he's about to charge your safe. The next solution was the rotation we had up until this last update, where slot 4 rotated between BB and modifier SD. That way, only showdown could have modifiers. The problem with this rotation was that 50% of the time 2/4 slots were showdown. That led to what we have today.
---
Now, I imagine you're wondering why modifiers on slot 2 were fine now but weren't when they first implemented them. This is where we get back to those original #StopTheSpin crusaders. Don't get me wrong, modifiers DO add new content and freshen up the game for long time players. The problem is the way they are treated. They DO NOT stop teaming. That's an objective fact. The only one that did stop teaming was removed, and no one knows why supercell removed it. The others are pure RNG. What stops me from teaming even with a super juice, or in a health field? Despite this, those same vocal minorities started a new campaign after modifiers came out: get them on all showdown games, no exceptions. While this campaign had ended up dying out a bit ago, supercell did end up implementing what they wanted. SC says non-modifier showdown will cycle in, but even then it's a bit extreme.
---
Hopefully that clears everything up for you.

Lastly, I wrote this on a phone, so please excuse any stupid autocorrect errors.

I'm not hungry for up votes. This is literally my first post on reddit and the only reason I'm here is because I wanted to share my opinion about how the game has changed post update.

This has to be the worst crow play I've seen. He could've just attacked from a distance. But no, he is too impatient, and decided to swoop in even though you had your super ready and you were near the poison clouds.

Instead of dropping power cubes, you should be awarded them directly to your brawler to award kills.
---
r/LootStars
---
I see a lot of people complaining just because they went over 7k trophies but your case is different having multiple maxed brawlers is your proof of opening enough brawl boxes
---
Although i purchased 2 brawlers and many mega boxes i have 22 brawlers and i am sure i am not even close enough to opening as much brawl boxes as you had
---
Sorry for english i wish you will get multiple brawlers from a brawll box
---
U said it doesn‚Äôt pull it‚Äôs because u missed
---
You know what! Each hand can be different liquids and we tosses them they take a second or whatever to mix then they explode. To solve the explosion delay for dynamike
---
Then just buy it before it gets a rework. Worked with Loaded Rico.

Sure it does. YouTube chemical reactions.  A lot of them are delayed. Also, as someone else said, he his other skin throws exploding peppers. Not sure super cell too focused  on making sense.

I don‚Äôt know if you made up those numbers, but if you didn‚Äôt how did you get them?

Holy shoot is that a mother flipping Jojo reference?!

How can a crow be a chicken isn't it odd üôÑ

Gene in bounty and Dynamike on an open map, nice

That‚Äôs so creepy! Lol really funny though!
---
he was good on release, he just wasn't super strong.
---
Girl teasers also have small pp

Will you do one for Leon?

Yes, but not all beta players have managed to do this, so you can identify some beta players but not all.

Steal his look
---
They dont look like his regular attack at all. Barley throws bottles of liquid. That's what this is.
---
Isnt it only pipers?
---
Bro you can‚Äôt say that Jessie is like 15, FBI yea he‚Äôs right here 
---
No or else he will be able to chase people way too fast and he will be too fast
---
well then it will make his attack look like barley's, not dinamike's. it's gonna completely ruin dinamike's personality.. he is supposed to throw dynamites, not bottles. so this skin doesn't fit him but fits barley for sure. and we can not disagree with that, that's what most of the people are saying so no it doesn't fit mike
---
The viles are shaped like his dynamite sticks. What do you mean? They dont have to break on impact they can sit on the ground then explode. 
---
Notice the ‚Äú...letting Carl can throw it again‚Äù

---
I think a lot of Android's work. But they will probably overheat easily and run out of battery quickly.
---
I apologize for not making myself clear. I'm not talking about the people who dislike teaming, I'm talking about the anti-teaming crusaders. While I understand that not all anti-teamers support modifiers on slot 2, those crusaders do. They are a minority within a minority, yes, but as I stated they are a minority that speaks rather loudly, and they are the people who aught to take the blame for this.
---
That‚Äôs not true. It‚Äôs just very brawler dependent. If you have good reflexes you could do well here. 
---
This is epic
---
There‚Äôs no problem, it just gets annoying when people post the same exact thing over and over again in the hopes that it will receive attention. 
---
Not sure how they can stop it. A great many nations have risen and crumbled over the centuries over alliances formed and broken... on a much smaller scale teaming is an alliance formed in order to survive
---
I think they are celebrating Clash Royale birthday party. The theme music has also been changed to "Royale themed soundtrack" 
---
Get this on Trending 
---
Yep I know
---
Ikr, her turret is frustrating to deal with. I have never got the chance to be a big brawler though :'(

Imagine,you spawn as brock in outer circle,not inside,and you go on a jump pad to escape the outer circle cuz of poison,and then,you check those bushes to one of the jumpads,and,bull or shelly camping there,and nothing goes here cuz you cant get her because the bush is big,you need to enter the bush,but it actually gonna be your death as a marksman,even if luckilly you got  shelly because her iq was 5 or ten and she was standing still, although,there is  still pads where you need to enter the bush 100%So you heard,what i'am talking about))

Imagine having a game room with three, and going i to battle. One goes intentionally AFK while the other two try to win. If they win, they get trophies, if they lose, they wont lose trophies.
---
People love his star power, Idk if it should be changed but i like the idea!
---
Well m8 auto aim is an essential thing,sometimes you gotta aim but you dont always get the time calculate and it saves alot of time too...so sorry but i dont think it will leave :/

no, if friends teaming up in the game room then there will be no afk forgiveness anymore, like Vainglory (if you have played the game)

I don't know why they don't just have 3 Showdown maps on permenant 24hr rotation, have 2 normal and 1 mod. No one plays Brawlball or Hiest. If they keep only having 1 with mods on rotation I think a lot of people will stop playing. Get rid of the stupid mushrooms mod, and bring back the only thing that actually prevented teaming - Life Leech.
---
i think turrets count as pets in the game???

Theory... what if Ricochet originally a enemy robot then he became a outcast, (betrayed his career as a enemy robot) then that may explain why he had his identity hidden that may be why he has a bandana, and a hat, in brawlstars old video where it introduce some brawlers like Shelly and colt and stuff, it showed why they are WANTED, then that‚Äôs where my theory came from, what if Ricochet was wanted, for killing his own allies, then he may had switch ammo.

He is crying that Crow doesnt have a major buff

maybe
---
Yeah, that‚Äôs what I meant. Each time he gets a stab on an enemy they will get 4 ticks of poison damage. Poison damage is 98 per hit at max. 70% of that is 69(nice) rounded. Multiply that by 4 and it‚Äôs 276

Rant time. Frank in Big Game Hunt is a fucking joke. He was nerfed from his normal 3ish second stun time to what? 1 second. This "stun" is fucking pathetic and has no impact whatsoever. The reason this was made was to balance if two Franks were present so there wasn't an infinite. But the right solution would of been to only apply that IF there were two Franks. But nooo. Now Frank is useless, and one of the worst Brawlers to play. It's fucking ridiculous how they nerf him hard but keep shit like this in and keep summoners OP and the complete meta.

But he is a legendary. Legendaries are for really good gameplay and rekkin the other team. Not just a mid tier brawler like el primo would be.

Maybe give her a damage buff to her main attack as well as a damage nerf to her super. That way, she isn‚Äôt dependant on it.

This wouldn't be a typical showdown map, more like a quick version of it in duos. The middle-left spawn would be annoying to spawn at bexuase there are so many teams around. However current real maps also have good and bad spawns!!

I know I'm bad at big game if I'm the big brawler

I think she wanted to play not as a big brawler since piper could deal more damage from distance so that she will have more ability to stay alive :v

Well, I mean why were they trying to get stars when they basically already won?

I want this offer

Hi Kairos you will probably don‚Äôt see this comment but I need your help : I have a friend who only team in solo showdown and I said to him that‚Äôs ruin the game but he continue to do it . Can you help me to stop him please ? .
---
Sorry for my grammar i‚Äôm French .
---
still havent figure out how to beat those shotgunners with mortis.

what am i doing wrong??

I even posted it on Reddit yesterday

Yeap... and with all elprimo and bulls, everyone was at the edges camping
---
They need to change the rewards
---
Yeah, unfortunately, if there is in the game I will never have it ;-;
---
I thought I was lucky the other day when I got Piper and Pam in 2 boxes in a row. I'm shit at playing Piper btw lol. 
---
Shelly does really well on this map though
---
Aaaaaand the search begins.
---
Wow, 19 brawlers and a record of 10800 cups. Thats ü§ê good  :]
---
Can‚Äôt really do that if you aren‚Äôt playing a burst damage brawler.

These guys were actually some randoms

Yeah. There are so many korean designer in reddit. :)

Bu..bu...but Reinhardt says that
---
Yeah i was wondering why no shelly was in lol
---
My name on Brawl Stars is Dr. Strange. Hmm
---
Yeeees i got him too and he immediatly became my main. Good in bounty gem grab and duo. Solo is not really his speed neither is heist hes is ok in brawl ball keep distance your main point is to keep opponents damaged!
---
That is *strange*
---
I hate this format but i love this meme
---
And no boxes
---
And time as a boss brawler
---
Beta Player Here. I so Not have any legendarys or even mythic
---
Yeah
---
My solution: 
---
If Supercell watched a few random solo showdown battles a day and gave temporary but serious bans like 2 week bans(banned from the whole game, not just showdown) to teamers, teaming would drastically reduce. 
---
Wreck everybody cuz pam is so good..
---
That's amazing, keep up the great work man!!! Mortis next? ;)

Nope. A manly voice comes out of a female skin.

Nope rather have them fix the maps we play on

---
Rico.. are you okay?
---
The lvl 35 pack is a scam anyway
---
Yeah but you can also just have a lot of really active and good friends...
---
Unfortunately I still do not have it, but I know he's too crazy to play at Gem Grab and Showdown (pulling enemies to the Poison)
---
But aiming with piper isn't easy at all plus this map puts piper in a disadvantage because of the bushes. I believe she gave up.
---
How are you so good with colt? How did you practice? I seem to miss my shots with him even when I‚Äôm trying to mirror opponents movements. 
---
Only beta players will notice something....
---
Wow man awesome
---
No.
---
Which is kinda hard to find if u don‚Äôt have proper irl friends
---
Wham bam everyone. 
---
You think you have finished firing her trash but it just keeps on going. Not every one of her trash will hit as they don't fire all at the same time. Put her healing turret behind walls. Or you can use it as a shield too as most people try to get the turret out even if no one is using it. 
---
With her turret you can put it away from you so it attracts enemies and suprise them from behind etc. She is good but just takes a while to get used to how she fires (for me anyways).
---
Is it just me or can Mortis also be used as a bushmaster like Bull?
---

r/engrish
---
if you see another person spinning at you or around you and is playing passive they 99% want to team. in lower trophies it‚Äôs not as common as ‚Äúsee and kill‚Äù but once you‚Äôre around 250ish trophies it becomes a big issue

U are the guy that stole my nick! After all these years!

---

---
Sounds like you're too caught up on your trophies. I don't want to be rude but if you feel the only way for you to sustain your trophies with certain brawlers is bush camping in showdown then maybe your brawler should be lower trophies so you can actually play them in a more engaging way. 
---
Also you complain about teaming but to be honest bush camping is another problem in showdown that I think needs to be addressed. It doesn't encourage actually playing or trying to get kills and is overly necessary to consistently climb in showdown. Personally I'm actually loving the modifiers on more showdown events because it encourages more roaming and playing less passively.
---
Tru mai engrich sux pleade halp meh

I don't care what you say of me, I just find stupid that all of these kids will repost this shit while ruining even more the subreddit. And the worse thing, is that it will not change anything, Supercell already know how the community doesn't like teaming. Making this bullshit if reposting is useless.

At least the first StopTheSpin movement made sense and actually helped, and it didn't needed shitty reposts

That lv10 gene wasn‚Äôt so balanced tho

It's their game so they choose what to do. If they want his bottle to bounce they will. Is the inconsistency you're talking about how it would have to break because its glass and Barley's glass bottle breaks?

Crow is really easy to play compared to other brawlers bc of his attack spread, decent range, and fast movement speed. However, he‚Äôs not that good when u get higher in trophies bc his dps is very low and most of the time, u can simply ignore it and kill him

It's so easy to push Shelly, and I'm an auto aim noob and love using Shelly, lol.

It‚Äôs easy to say but this game was quite similar like you said, there was one Shelly vs 5 vs 4 and Shelly ranked 10 .

There‚Äôs a difference between attacking others by teaming and defending yourself from teamers.

I swear a good chunk of them are healing related lol

Dont play mortis in siege then lmfao

i just ask when Night Witch mortis will be returned

 He could do A little more precised

Yes

I made a social experiment with a bull yesterday: I went in the middle of the map and started spinning. Here are the teamers: 2 Night witch Morti, 1 poco, 3 crows, 1 Darryl, 1 Primo, 1 Dynamike (don't ask me who used him in Island invasion).  
---
Here are the backstabbers: 1 Nita, 5 bulls, 2 shellies, 2 Morti (one hat and one no hat), and 1 Pam  
---
Here are those who just killed me: 3 Bulls, 4 Primos, 5 Shellies, 2 Franks, 1 Pam and 1 Colt  
---
Those who ignored me: 2 Genes, 3 Colts, 1 Rico, 3 Crows and 1 Nita
---
What are you talking about? It will not be changed
---
no but if everyone says the same thing it must be for a reason
---
In defense, Brawl Ball Jessie is nowhere near as frequent as she was before with the latest maps they have put out. A lot more obstacles than the open soccer field she previously would destroy on.

Yeah, definitely at a certain point power points and gold are worthless, I'd say after 7500/10k there is no point...
---
Wait that's it! After 5000k unlock a second store that charges large amounts of gold for special skins, borders, icons. That way you have things to work towards still, and a means to use all this gold pilling up.

How did you get 10 power ups with so many people alive at the end?

What magazine
---
ahhhh thank youu! I love Crow 2D concept 
---
In my experience most people run Bull, or Primo over 50% of the time and Shelly is the best at stuffing them easy so I almost always go Shelly on solo showdown and it usually works pretty well for me. This list doesn't surprise me but good to know I'm on the right track.

This art is awesome! It really brings the spooky vibe outta mortis :)

I‚Äôm with you buddy. They don‚Äôt even have to give us anything. 
---
Nice idea...
---
Tara Does a respect trick when she lose 
---
A  xiomi user! 
---
nice to meet you
---
;-;
---
One of the best skin ideas I've ever seen
---
You could make the farmer poco that dataminer found at the game files
---
I know
---
I follow him on Twitter
---
And I like him
---
That means you chargebacked a purchase
---
ikr matchmaking is broken without a doubt
---
You could have pretended to team and then killed them when they got close to you.
---
u think ur good but u are just an annoying kid who likes saying stuff. Nobody asked for your opinion so stop
---
nice to meet you too :D
---
¬øC√≥mo dijo?
---
Probably 
---
Sarcasm 100 (not being sarcastic)
---
I thought the same thing, but meteors don‚Äôt exist in practice mode so idk
---
What about 400 per shot at max level? Up close it would be around 2000 dmg per hit which is quite good for taking low and mid ho brawlers.
---
Wo ist die Karte denn? Vor allem ist es wichtig, hier Englisch zu schreiben, der Subreddit ist nicht Deutsch
---
Cool idea, the skin would probably go up to 80 gems tho
---
U posted it twice???
---
oh ok
---
o vrry nice!!!üëçüëçüëç
---
 sorry for just seeing this now...
---
Idk what the hell did i just saw but i liked it
---
The only way to stop teaming is banning players. These modifiers do nothing
---
Nah it doesn't help most times and people usually get stuck
---
I deleted a version a long time ago due to not many upvotes :/
---
Ryan: new skin new brawler new map is all good, but when can we expect some actual game content like making use of bands, giving something to do for people with nearly maxed out brawlers, and making the trophy progression road something a little more interesting? I feel like you guys constantly make minor adjustments to the parts of the game that are already amazing, but you keep doing these things where you have these temporary boosts of excitement from skins and brawlers, but when are you guys going to really make the core heart of the games system better?
---
LeETS GET GRAPHING
---
EEEELLLL PRRIIIIIIMMMMOOOOO
---
He wouldn't be my friend anymore
---
That moves through/over puddles? üëåüíØ
---
that is how you trully play the game
---
Such detailed hands
---
I agree, but if the gas comes in wouldn't that kill of the safe early game, making the game more offensive? I decided to make the safe HP somewhat low so you have to defend, but I see where you are coming from!
---
looks great
---
Did you hear about Clusterbombdude and Animal? These are brawlers they‚Äôre working on.
---
I only need Leon as f2p
---
You sucks, man
---
you know (a slang in my state) u k...you knoa
---
Funny and I‚Äôm the 1000th upvote woohoo
---
And I deleted the last one, happy now?
---
As a Crow player, I can say he needs a slight buff to his damage.
---
an already good 8/10 pun with an originality bonus makes this a 17/10
---
you rarely see originality on this sub
---
My highest brawler is poco because i use him in solo showdown
---
XD
---
Exactly.  I dont understand why they haven't. It would require no effort for them to do 
---
He got 2 huge buffs in a row. He should get a nerf -52 damage to be more even
---
That‚Äôs the thing though a damage buff is tough because that could pretty easily make him op. When crow is used as intended he can be pretty hard to stop. Especially with a few power cubes.
---
who said he didnt
---
You are a god :O
---
I deleted it a long time ago idk how u seen it :P
---
They were also brand new with those characters lol
---
WAIT HOW DID YOU GET A OFFER IN THE SHOP FOR GENE PLZ TELL ME SOMEONE I WANT TO BUY A NEW BRAWLER PLZZZ TAKE MY MONEY I WANT A OFFER LIKE THAG IN GHE SHOP
---
I‚Äôd prefer him to be op lol
---
#stopthespin

Lol if you don‚Äôt mind what‚Äôs your trophy count and level with crow?

Lol I was about to report this

First brawler I upgraded to level 10 and maybe 400 trophies
---
You deleted it a fee minutes ago...that's not a long time, is it? And if you don't like my concept just ignore it... I want feedback that would help me improve, I don't have the time to argue with you...
---
It's called a flair, look for it in the subreddit, if you don't know how to change it just google it, it's quite easy.
---
Thanks
---
I gotcha you can definitely 500 him where you‚Äôre at. Definitely the highest skill cap brawler in the game currently.
---
Then don‚Äôt lmao. I was only saying that reposting leads to downvotes and you started arguing. If you don‚Äôt have time, then simply don‚Äôt lmao.

Unless winning is losing in one timeline

This game is booty. I have opened 10 mega boxes and all I have gotten is a super rare
---
No pls 
---
Well thats a point.
---
Thanks for answering btw :)
---
You beat me to it
---
That would be great. Sadly, knowing supercell, it would cost like 500 gems. 
---
If you pause at the right moment you can see it says match over
---
I agree with the other guy, Pipers and Bos supers dont need changes. Your suggestion for Pennys star power makes it even more useless. How many times does the turret actually kill someone, and will stay alive to get many kills?
---
Shelly (nerf) because of her super, pam (nerf), crow (buff),SHELLEX NERF BECAUSE HE DOES TOO MUCH DAMAGE AND HIS SUPER BASICALLY DESTROYS THE UNIVERSE LOL JK LOLLLL üòÇüòÇüòÇ

That‚Äôs always a lose scenario really, not a bull issue.
---
Anyone can just hide in a bush and see that if you‚Äôre low on health/running away from someone they can just finish you off.
---
But I get it.
---
I dont team lol
---
Oh island invasion comes but now without modifiers

lucky if u get 2 in a row

Why is this post classified as "NSFW"
---
OMG dude it‚Äôs awsome I can pay 200 gems for that skin 
---
12 coins: Im literally the guy in the pic
---
The thing that irkes me the most about showdown is greedy shotgunners stealing kills so I'm happy
---
Idk
---
chips were my favorite
---
Wow a bull out of the bush.. must have been really good times.. 
---
no
---
Get this man a job
---
you sucks?
---
this is facts
---
Firstly this is a joke, but also slightly serious, because as it's clear from most posts, basically nobody here is a true teamer, and those that are aren't gonna be convinced otherwise 
---
T h e  b l u e
---
Every fuckin time 
---
Why doesn‚Äôt it work for me?
---
Imagine being this desperate for legendaries
---
I don't team in showdown unless i'm poco, Everyone can trust a poco because he does no damage, but I always backstab. I know it's pretty toxic but it brought me a lot of trophies for poco, I mean... It works.
---
Butter Brawl
---
Same I contacted supercell and they kinda shut me down
---
A little
---
I also think that this map is hot garbage 
---
I did not buy all the special deals/ But I‚Äôve been seeing that there‚Äôs many people that been getting offers for mythic‚Äôs and legendary‚Äòs
---
i just said im not sure, i think they once said something, but again, im not sure

Seems like it would take care of itself with that many teaming. Gonna have to turn on each other eventually. 
---
ridiculous. 
---
Hax
---
Sorry?
---
Hi Carl 
---
It‚Äôs not a waste of ammo if it guarantees that there‚Äôs no one in bush and the only one that can‚Äôt Bull check a bush is El Primo because even Darryl can Bull Check a Bush.
---
I always assume there‚Äôs someone in any random bush and how you keep getting ambushed to a minimum 
---
Huh. Okay then.
---
I just hit 9750 and I don‚Äôt have enough gold to upgrade my brawlers.  How do you guys not need gold
---
is it N4Ni!?
---
PP?

Now see my post

I will roast you now. Shelly is no-skill OOOOOOOoooOOoOOoOoOohhhHHH roasteddd üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÅüòÅ
---
With 16 brawlers is easy stay on 6000 trophies, you just are bad. 
---
(I no speak english)
---
What‚Äôs up Carl?
---
At least buy Carl.
---
His point is that better players have the better positioning/awareness needed.
---
If you look at what a lot of Youtubers say about Bull, they reflect his comment about his usage. It may feel overpowered to you, but once you get better at the game, you‚Äôll learn to play the matchup better.
---

*yeeeeah*

Um but then it would be practically impossible to hold on to the gems.

Yes. You're paying 50-100% for the same amount of boxes for no reason.

Why nerf Jessie?

Even me brother ! While every one are getting legendary offer !! I‚Äôm not getting from past 3 days   I just left with Leon

How do you make these?
---

---
That‚Äôs great, but when u get to 14.5K that‚Äôs the best 
---
Of course it is it‚Äôs just more common with bull especially on specific maps 
---
Wow, that's perfectly done
---
The super crashes your game
---
Where are the spawns?
---
That's what you think, but it isn't fun to go on losing streak that never end and I wish to get new brawler, but I don't get them...
---
They already  added 4 gen man i didnt play it like 1 year üòÇ
---
Ill take that as Positiv Critic, but Fact is, first 30%+ to the IKE?! Second even the Best YouTubers are cought off Guard, and they hate it to, and the Mostly Cut it Out ;)
---
I saw someone suggest a fix to this would be getting a trophy every kill you got? Not sure how it would work but some variant of that seems logical
---
In big game she is too Op
---
r/choosingbeggars
---
Why don‚Äôt you just sign up? 
---
Not realistic, primo would‚Äôve knocked himself over

Well yes but no
---
Thanks for these tips, i‚Äôve been struggling trying to push mortis in most game modes, and these will probably help 
---
Agree, and make same for penny

im jealous:0
---
Yay, Top Hat Mortis!üëç

üòÇ you ¬¥re right

I just found it I didnt get popular so I didnt notice it im sorry

I agree 100%. This map is extremely bad rn, and in all honesty it should just be removed.

---
I toguht that them were less powerfull so you land betwen the lake and the wall. But yes you are right
---
I really think is a good idea for people that don‚Äôt wanna play for trophies or just wanna try brawlers with real people.
---
seriously? nita gang? xD lmao
---
You are a legend to take a screenshot at precise time
---
Lol, I have 13 brawlers, and I have 4001 trophies.
---
Jelly Belly Shelly
---
This game used to have a plot, well a lore. Yep, a lore for each and every brawler until supercell decided to remove it one day for no reason or explanation.  
---
It got replaced by boring, bland description summaries of what the brawler does. Really disappointing.
---
That's not how you use that meme template 
---
Kairos and some others have done videos on these, a few months old but only a few have been buffed/nerfed since
---
https://youtu.be/LZyde_iP3kg
---
I'm curious, how can you be sure you've played with over 900 crows before? Also, what is your trophy level? 
---
"BETRAYAL!"
---
I hate it. I don't have Primo and I'm at 491 trophies, so I usually use Shelly on showdown. This map for Shelly isüòí
---
For everything. The list is almost infinite 
---
Yep, I agree my Friend
---
Out of all the maps they have and new ones they put this one in smh I only played it to get the star token and I‚Äôm done 
---
Love the photoshop

U got me, level 30 is my highest.

Nice.

I wouldn't be surprised if the devs buff the range of the IKE soon, though, to counteract that.
---
Just remove the center grass. Problem solved 
---
I doubt it because I made this graphic and everything
---
If you "win" against a Nita/Jessie in Big Game, you're OP

I didn‚Äôt even know you were rico, I stopped playing the game so the new skins confuse me.
---
Always happens to me 
---
I would totally buy
---
I am horrible with Rico, so I wasn‚Äôt mad
---
100 would definitely buy
---
Teaming would be a bitch in this
---
Mortis can be really good on gem grab on some maps. He is good at hiding in bushes and dashing in for the gems if your team mates can hold the gem spawn.
---
Ok
---
I think it‚Äôs lag and I‚Äôm pretty sure they are constantly working on reducing that! Your movement needs to be verified and synced by the server and if the connection is really slow, it will appear as if you‚Äôre barely moving.

I remember when this map was posted and I thought it would never be added...

Yeah but they always get easily wrecked
---
Was thinking about that when developing, like bolts or some new drop item, so that the safes can get stronger
---
You can get wizard barely through supercell id
---
Asymmetrical 3v3 maps will lead to people complaining about bad spawns or favor one side over the other.
---
Agreed üåö

Hey dude u know in practice mode everyone is upgraded and there are no meteors. LMAO!
---
I get people with power lvl 10 and trophies around 480 and I'm like stuck on 400 and power lvl is 7
---
Someone angry bout all dem bushes
---
That's the thing - using Mortis as a gem carrier is really bad. He should be played as an aggro. By holding the gems, Mortis gets handicapped. 
---
I guess I argue more so the balance between characters rather than the servers 
---

You can. You jump to one of the corner islands, then the corner islands are able to take you back to the main island.
