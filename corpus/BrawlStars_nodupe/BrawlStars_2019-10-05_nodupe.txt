Everybody down vote. Make his/her karma go negative. If anyone else reposts, they will be tracked down and down voted until they have negative karma.

He wrote stats wdym dude
---
I don't think that's true. Brawl stars can't detect you using a third-party mod app because you're not connected to their servers but lwarb's servers
---
Also if you look closely at Jessies waste, a spike appears below her. It's quite hard to unsee after that
---
My first brawler apart from trophy road was barley.

EL PRIMOOOOOOOOOOOOO

I agree shes rlly strongk rn tbh i feel dirty using her

Yeah, but what if you somehow already have all 4 legendary brawlers?
---
gotcha thx
---
aight
---
Bruh this post was on instagram. Is this even you?
---
Exactly
---
 200-400 gems if  you have all.
---
I’ve been maxing roughly one brawler every week. I only have six brawlers left that I’m missing power points for, so I get gold relatively quickly. Granted my drop rates for star powers have been really lucky recently (about one per 20 boxes) and that can cut off at any time, but at the rate I’m getting gold now I should easily have every brawler at least power 9 in 6 months, and realistically I should have about 10-15 of the 41 star powers from pulls and a few more from the shop.
---
Of course, in that time, probably 3-5 new brawlers will be out. I probably won’t have the two most recent up to 9 yet.
---
I’ve played just over half the time you have, so for you to have less on your account than I have on mine I’m pretty sure you’ve just been really unlucky.
---
Well planned comeback my friend. 10/10.
---
Let me remind you it's you asking for the speed buff not me so remind me who sucks.

No. Stop asking for free stuff. If they did this they would lose out on money demand if they have no money they cant run the game anymore

Honestly her super is good in 3v3s because teammates would defend you.
---
but in Solo SD you don't have anyone to back you up when you use your super (apart from the teamers, im crying and shaking rn Piper would never team). she is a support, she can't defend herself without the help of her teammates, her super isn't made for SD, it was for 3v3s.

Oh thank you very much I had to see it so many time

how shelly is holding her shotgun?
---
Did I hear doot?
---
You made that Brawl Ball art right?
---
I mean the can go inside and just get their super and kill everyone instantly
---
Oh no
---
Supercell will but it isn't Rosa level bad where they needed the emergency balance change. Especially since he is legendary so he isn't as prevelant. As for a nerf I think they need to nerf his super duration for sure. His super charge maybe 1 more hit and maybe a small damage nerf
---
Yeah before they nerfed it, it was broken af but now it’s worse than shell shock
---
I am over 13k and dont have a legendary. : (
---
Though Leon was heavily nerfed on siege since invisibility no longer works on the ike
---
Wtf Carl?
---
Unlike you
---
Why are leon and nita shipped so much?!
---
Really tho its fucking my game up when im playing 3v3 he just stands there for a sec and comes back again i need to find the source of this or this will happen forever it happens every time i log in
---
Peeps use her in competitive you know
---
with snappy sniping my Piper is level 7 but yea she’s pretty broken in competitive rn
---
Well I got a legendary with a worse chance than that so beat of luck

How do u do that I have lwarb but idk how to make a skin

Nothing special eh

but everybody saying it is a repost and nobody downvote the people who wrote that this a repost
---
Needs a rework on how we play but nice mode
---
oh wait
---
never mind it is not repost
---
No one asked.
---
How would the token rewards be distributed? Would it be like the murderer gets 4 tokens added to a 10 token base when an innocent dies and the innocents get 4 tokens deducted from a 30 token base for each innocent that dies?
---
Maybe also make it so that instead of you dying if you kill another innocent, your location will be revealed to the murderer for a little bit (5 seconds?) depends on how large these maps are going to be. Also there should be a thing where when an innocent dies, theres a marking that shows the spot where they died (maybe like a skull with a marker that shows what brawler died there?) so that it makes everything more interesting. Also maybe there should be a max time like how the other ticketed modes have (6 minutes?)

That was my first thought like everyone is gonna end up just grouping up so playing frank youll have a 1/4 chance of killing the murderer

Supercell balance...bush camping should not be in the game. My idea is that, every 10 seconds someone is camping in a bush, they start taking damage so they need to leave the bush.

Damn funny meme but true
---
She is made to counter tanks. Although its true that she is weak against long range brawlers. P.s. she is even weaker without her super. If she doesnt have her super charged up, then even el primo, bull and darryl have a chance to win against her. With el primo he can use his super and stun her, same with darryl, you just need that perfect roll and then spam shots. For bull, you need to be point blank face to face against shelly to have a chance to win against her. Thats an explanation why shes weak, and why her super is the main thing needed in a lot of situations.
---
they see me rollin'
---
YOU ALSO are a good man as well, thank you
---
What about spawning powercubes like in Takedown?
---
Why not a 10 to 20 people and a large map for it then it can be more fair to the murder
---
You mean Night Witch skin. Most rockabilly users bought him for 39 gems, like me.
---
So true
---
then stop typing LIKE THIS
---
yes i upvoted cause it's funny how the mode is takedown but the map is bulk up
---
Unless you are 850 trophies, there they know how to pass the ball, stay 5 seconds alive with the gems or literally not killing themselves rushing the enemy spawn
---
Thanks for the info but they should play other brawlers and not farm a brawler to 600 (its just a thropie lose smh)
---
mostly, it's people, who boosted their main to the 15k&gt; and they're just bored, and have nothing to do
---
It made it to the game
---
U do know u can lift off the curse by just connecting to supercell id
---
Sounds good! Still needs more changes to actually be a mode, but I would really like that!
---
Oh I didn't know😂😅
---
I'm sorry but do you know any math? One bigbox worth like 3 boxes. Megabox is like 3 bigboxes and one small box. Megabox would worth about 30 startokens or bit more. 1000 startokens for mega box can take months.
---
So nice of u. I have all the brawlers ecxept the legy's.😭
---
Lmao if the Murderer spins with the innocent as frank and then everyone think he innocent and spin and then...
---
Let me fix your fix....
---
I present you Xaxon, the biggest idiot on earth. He brought piper to brawl ball with randoms.
---
Now we got it.
---
yep
---
Maybe all 6 players could be the same brawlers, maybe Colt or Shelly, their names would be all be replaced with a question mark.
---
Maybe maps with a lot of Bush could go well with this map?
---
then Shelly gets her super-
---
Oh. And he may have intentionally passed that thinking he could kill and tank his way in while piper walked it in behind him. Poor primo. Had a piper on his team.

1. Select Boss fight as a normal gamemode

2. Invite a friend 
---
3. Press friendly game button
---
(after doing so, a boss fight friendly game page will appear, it only allows 1 player to play the game so you probably have to kick the friend out)

you can also use star powers here, like in reglar friendly games, but you have to select a brawler again first

Mr bar would say “ I love you bibi”

But that would almost double your box intake. No way they would give us that many boxes.

That would be a mega box every 5 days, more realistic time frame would be like every 2 weeks.

Post this on yt. This is the first brawl stars video that actually makes me giggle

Its case by case sure, but the sub doesn't need to go into "omg you didn't credit" mode when someone reposts something like an idea about trophy road rework. The comments end up being nothing useful. Lots of people do this stuff even if the post isn't exactly the same, just the same concept. Imagine photoshopping something for awhile and people just go "repost, I've seen this idea, kys".

I seriously don't see this in any sub but this one. Not sure if it's a generational thing or what.

---
Look at these nephews asking for free shit. As much as we (and I) want it, let's be real: Supercell is not going to do this. The end of season rewards is honestly enough when it comes to helping f2ps. Keep in mind that BS is significantly more f2p-friendly than other Supercell games. Just be content with the things you have already and stop asking for more.

I have good news for all of you. Everyone will eventually unlock every brawler

Curveball should be reworked slightly in my opinion. It makes it so you can at least 65% of the time hit your spikes on enemies as long as their in range. No skill what so ever, and there’s no good way to dodge it either

Tf Is that bounce?

i was talking about the person who posted i knew you were making fun
---
so not a woooosh
---
why would you risk losing your turret in the middle of a battle just to open a box? and by the time your super is fully charged the boxes around you may already be taken and also there has to be someone out there to destroy the turret for you, and if there was someone they may not even be a good dps brawler and why would you even attack the box instead of attacking the brawler. I really don't understand this situation with opening a box with this sp, very dumb imo.
---
I literally had to turn on data just to watch this and it was very well worth it
---
That was the best part of it!
---
More like Slime Rico
---
Can the innocents attack?
---
Your name is not even in there.
---
Just make it so the murderer can see clearly
---
the best
---
They were probably playing together, see the clan tag?

This is good😀

---
At 15k I still get 1k, 3k, 5k and 7k teammates lol, even when playing at 650 trophies
---
No. Don't touch Mama.
---
YES! A great idea indeed. We need to spam supercell with this cuz once you get to 14k there are no more mega boxes, which means no goodies :(
---
Haters would say its photoshopped
---
Can you send your channel link
---
But then it's auto win for the murderer
---
I think that thw star tokens should be aqquired by either getting star player in a 3v3 or getting 1st in a solo event/ duo showdown
---
They would ultimately have to add a time limit though, similarly to the standard tokens
---
Wheres the box lol
---
Yde would be proud of you
---
10/10 for this amazing art work like,WOOOOOOOW
---
It's look more like Mortis!!!

---
Okay
---
Freddy fazbear and Nita combined
---
Why would that be the best strategy please explain.  I fail to see how having two team mates struggle to keep up with dmg output of adds as a good idea.  Have a source for your strategy?  Numbers proving it or just hey this is what people are saying/doing?
---
he guball mushine bacuse bibi is eating he's body paRT
---
This. Letting a high burst damage brawler like bull take all the cubes is key to rekking that boss.
---
Revisions definitely favor the long range brawlers now
---
It’s just a meme, nothing actual brawl talk date related.
---
But then she would also need a buff in another stat... Asking for a nerf but not a buff is just useless
---
605 but ok
---
Thank you very much!
---
How is that even possible

Nice but make it 8 innocent, 1 murderer and 1 sherif

mom: but we actualyty got ticket at home
---
ticket at home:
---
No. It’s just a meme.
---
Yeaboi
---
Lol I thought it was yours because you said you were 6k in the title
---
I once was playing duo sd and had a gene teammate, later there were just 3 teams left, our team with 4 power cubes on each brawler, then a shelly and el primo team with 12 power cubes on each brawler and the 3rd team probably had low power cubes too, cause the were just hiding, so i thought "if we can run away and while the 12 power cube team hunts us, they'll probably find the 3rd team and kill them, so we get 2nd", but then the gene pulled the shelly to us and the walls got destroyed which made a way for the primo to come, but anyway, the shelly killed us both with 3 shots

The amount of his starpoints is insane! He must have  hacked it in.
---
Source: everybody, since the gamemode was added
---
It seems like you don't know that much about the game. Literally there are no situations where the whole team gets a chance to deal damage at the same time. Get good.
---
F
---
It's Nulls Brawl
---
You dont have to give a buff to justify a nerf, ironically that isnt how balancing works. 
---
In no single scenario, no matter how good you are - a mortis CANNOT touch a shelly with her super. Even if Yde or Yamada was the mortis and some 10 trophy noob the shelly, the shelly will always win, as long as they have the brains to use autoaim.
---
its a meme not an actual brawl talk idiot
---
El primo: wearing mask and towel and living in desert
---
mortis, the... creature of the night?!

Hey devonxy
---
Remember me from the KT server? 😊
---
Wtf
---
13.5k, missing Crow, Leon and Sandy. Just got Spikey boi a few days ago.
---
Kid, you didn't understand what I said.
---
If she is a bad brawler (you even said I was right), why would you nerf her and not give her a buff? If she is bad, and gets another nerf, she will be even worse. You are just as salty as OP
---
Well a win is a win
---
I didn't want this to end..well done!
---
?
---
When there is so much leonita NSFW stuff on r/brawlstarsp and then brawl stars officially announces that they are siblings, but no one cares on that sub, cause they're all degenerates
---
Nah man a good mortis has a love hate relationship with them.
---
now we have only one cuestion 
---
you are veriest lucky or unlacky?
---
Thats just unlucky mostly you get 1 in 2 or 3 weeks
---
Yes. Not only do they steal cubes from Pam, they also suicide for that cube. And then they do it again. I don't get how people can be so stupid or even selfish.
---
Good shit
---
LeOn
---
Patience is the key to success😅
---
Ignoring the edit, good idea! I'd love to play my fav brawler as a pumpkin and not a dumpling for a while😂
---
HAAAPY CAAKEDAAYY TOO YYOOUUUUU!!!❤️🍰🎂🍰❤️
---
This moments make me wish there was friendly fire
---
just no...
---
Ya just hate that stupid unskilled face in the Bush ;&gt;
---
Ok thx that makes a lot more sense👍
---
i was also a Leonita shipper
---
We can be sad together
---
Bibi skini hazır yarın geliyo🤗
---
When you write the binary code so fast and forgot to caps this 😂
---
Most of the ideas are just shit like CTF that would never work out in the real game
---
I have 647 trophie whit leon.. IN BRAWL BALL I GET 13 TROPHIE TEAMATE 🤯🤯🤯
---
YOSS
---
How would you communicate? This wouldn't really work in brawl stars
---
Good, that would be broken if they were level 1.
---
Lmao never celebrate too early
---
Depends, most (if not all) of the appa like paint got an option to change font after writing the text, are you using a mobile or pc app and how is it called?
---
Not that big of a deal both you guys died less Than a minute in

---
(hmm) 
---
also don’t flame people for using emojis lmao
---
Ага
---
Even furrier nita
---
Very interesting idea! It would be my pleasure to draw him for you! Question though, I feel like he should have a more unique main attack, also, I think epic rarity would be more realistic. Furthermore, I may change some of his mechanics, but definitely keep the base brawler as is. Thanks!
---
No one at all
---
This is my idea of a perfect battle of ''siege'': players can reforce their Brawlers with casses, that i put in strategics points, and play  whit several strategies  using the barricades ( these have weak  and  strong points)
---
not bad just the centre needs to be open
---
*Takedown
---
Looks like you miss (I don't know this word)
---
But since I speak Portuguese, I can understand Spanish easily
---
Yuh I just did hahaha
---
Why is this nsfw?
---
Complete the road gang
---
Wny did i read it as minecraft?
---
Ah, then it is acceptable
---
Ah, then I am stupid. I agree it needs more time or a smaller map
---
Can it be drawn on paper our digital
---
Can we get a vid?
---
Sorry about the wait! I’ve been busy with my studies and other projects. But worry not! If you’re on the list, you’ll get what ya need!
---
Showdown? I don't think so
---
I can only hear this in Shelly's voice and I love it.
---
Please don't even talk about a pass no just noooo
---
"Your not the only one cursed with knowledge"
---
So the game doesnt give us legendaries so we complain, you in the other hand has 2 legendaries so you think that noone should complain which doesn't make sense cuz none is as lucky as you
---
Im on an iphone on ios 9 so no :/
---
WOW. His fleet look so realiztig! 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏

Yeah!! This can creat fight between your friends

That's not what "in a nutshell" means.

I have 2 more if you want to rofl.

Don't think Kairos is a word. I think somebody wrote the subtitles.

Woah I was just scrolling through and I saw this

Amazing

Finally someone that thinks It the same way as me

Geometry dash font, yes!

My Ideas for Story Mode:
---
-You a Shelly at begin. Then you meet all Trophy Road Brawlers 
---
- You can change your ways and when you meet a Brawler you doesn’t have the chance for this Brawler from a box gets highter
---
I’m a sucker for delta rune  music I applaud you
---
My God there's an insane mode what's beyond that and how do you beat it give your boss your brawler some crack and a little speed my Lord
---
I can't believe the sandstorm pulled a Mario and Luigi series on you
---
He is too girly
---
stolen jokes aren't as cool as original ones
---
Third time I see this post..
---
I wanted SPIKE not LEON.
---
r/BrawlStars didn't like that.
---
I don't understand
---
where are you? are small bot?
---
yes
---
You at least have mortis
---
But 8Bit is the worst. He's slow and keeping distance with the bots is crucial in late game.
---
Other brawlers may struggle but they can buy the team mates some time if nothing goes wrong
---
No, it's just a fun way to see if I can hit some goal
---
Can your rank go down? Like if u rank 13 can u go down to rank 12 or no?
---
Nice grammar
---
Those dang primos
---
I don't think you can take out a bear with a Bo and arrow
---
rang is on russian, nita is in english? Huh?
---
Nice Panic! fan
---
Rip Mario and Luigi Inside story was the best
---
Honchcrow used Toxic, *The opponent is now badly poisoned*!
---
They didn't even get to remake partners in time
---
thanks! :)
---
That is the most heart breaking part. But at the same time kinds glad. I hated the Inside story remake. They made it too easy
---
Yes i know the original dialogue. But crow singing is just make me feel weird
---
*boss puts on mask and rejects botanity*

What other bird is there?

Probably after Thanksgiving (Canadian/true Thanksgiving)
---
LOL all my accts and families' have to do with doge (Meet\_TheDoge, Not\_Doge, dogemaster, I eat doges, and DogeMon 999)
---
Im still crying for Caesar
---
Idk because certain brawlers have different speeds, health, and damage. In CoD it's only switching weapons not entire character. It might work but it'd be a bit hard to balance and just like takedown and lone star people would have their problems at first
---
I think you don't like playing Colt
---
Well, there are subs for everything and i mean everything, like r/carsfuckingdragons, i mean this and the brawlstars NSFW subs aren't that bad, i've seen much, much worse subs, but i wont link them, the reason i've found them, is that somebody else linked them and my curious ass has to click on all links and if i would link them, i would be like the guy which made me find them
---
If you get all star tokens, you get a new kind of token, and 10 to get a mega box
---
Perhaps
---
I spectator someone and he took 3 seconds for a look but I'm impressed even I can't do that
---
AAAAA
---
750 is all it takes in Ireland?
---
I don't know, Poco is more of a support Brawler, and this is meant for an aggro play style. It doesn't seem right for Poco.
---
I mean, you also stole the top art from u/GarfieldPlutonZ, but you do you
---
I thought he saw shelly with no clothes but catl said x ray glasses so poco looked at her skeleton
---
Gotcha
---
Oh skeleton so nice shape I mean 69
---
Well, any chat system is bound to get abused by trolls, so there's a reason it's not already implemented.
---
In the intro to the sans fight, megalovania dosent play. Thanks for the compliment.
---
Why?
---
I still don't get it
---
I dont, it was sarcastic lol, you dont know me that well but if u did u would know.
---
yea we aren't massively active lol
---
"1-up is useless outside of showdown"
---
Lex did when it was at like 2%
---
Prepare for hate comments
---
Maybe mot u but The whole community hated me :( back then idk what i did
---
Gotta admit I was that Leon last time I played boss fight...but so are all my random teammates 🤦🏻‍♂️
---
It certainly is interesting, I've never seen something like this before, I was just a bit confused. Maybe it's because I thought that it would turn out that Povo actually had 42 powercubes or something idk. Great job either way
---
Very nice. But we already have lots of Mortis skins in the game. I would replace it for the night witch one.
---
I...I ah...I used mortis in boss fight yesterday...twice. Not even lying it was something me and my brother were trying to settle.
