Therefore, you should give me free karma :) Positive vibes

In general, life leech is a forced deterrent against teaming - it should probably be a near permanent fixture in showdown games.
---
However, I do like the idea of rewarding kills - although your time kill bonus would kind of encourage camping a bit, wait until the poison closes in to get kills closer together.
---

I really like using Nita, she’s fun to play especially in brawl ball. 
---
To the guy who sent a comment saying I maiming primo so he won’t watch it and deleted it, so I’m not all my brawlers are above 400 except primo actually lol, I only play showdown the reason they fall below 400 is when I try to get the star tokens, other than that I keep all my brawlers as close as I can one to the other.
---
Now you can watch it(:

Showdown, both solo and duo, occasionally gem grab.  Otherwise it depends on the map.  
---
The spread makes it easy to clear bushes and manage danger.  Plus the heal is obviously useful.

---
Sometime you can do it in Rockawall brawl. I do it to surprise the person in the bush behind the wall lol

No he was talking about piper. He never tweeted anything about Jessie

You could’ve just auto-fired your super if you were scared.

You could've literally just tap and hold on the image and download it ooooof

I mostly use him in solo/duo showdown as in solo I can corner an enemie or I can kill an enemie(usually such as Barley or Nita or around that health region). While in your case, I would either try to be half of a gem carrier as in I would only collect the gems that my other team members couldn't while letting them take the ones that are easy to acquire. Mortis is good in bounty maps as to intentionally draw in an enemie or kill small health brawlers. In brawl ball, Mortis used to be my go-to guy but he still good at windling down the brawlers that have the ball.

Not a glitch - ***this was literally listed in the update notes.***  It's purposely done to remove 1-tile gaps in the map.

El Primo is here
---
He is so annoying, he pretty much deserves it.

Upvoted you

New star power too... It's so bad

What about Bo and Nita

At least he fights for peace

Clearly they aren’t because they removed Life Leech

What?

---
Why someone down vote aw man its just a joke
---
Thank u!!
---
They removed life leech because of new players
---
All other modifiers SPAWNS SOMETHING either thats a meteor that damages you or mushrooms that heals you, but life leech PASSIVELY affects you 
---
From new players perspective, It WAS confusing (also I have a poll going on about life leech and event modifier)
---
I loved life leech so sad 
---
We can't always have what we want
---
Life isn't always fair and goes your way :D
---
Maybe they are planning on adding life leech based gamemode cuz its so popular 
---
FBI OPEN UP
---
Not if i die first 
---
they probably should but they dont
---
they decide by brawler trophies but even then ur situation seems to be weird
---
shouldn't happen often
---
NOT WHEN I'M BROCK!
---
I hate this. I have 4k trophies, my brother had like 1k and got Leon out of free box.
---
It's fixed, only legendary chance increases. 
---
They probably played before trophy road was released and got him from a brawl box
---
I don’t think this is 100% real m8. Unless you show off the account or give it away live this just looks like a scam for followers 
---
That can’t be real cause I lost 7 bounty games in a row earlier today
---
Prior to trophy road in beta, you could unlock bo and dynamike from boxes
---
Cringed so much from the title that even if the drawing is good I had to downvote, god damn the humblebrag level is insane on this one.
---
Oh thanks
---
Because they lost trophies using the glitch (did you check their overall trophies)
---
Barley, Jesse, Darrell, Mike, Primo and Mortis. Oh and Frank. And Piper. Need better skins for Piper. In no particular order. 
---
Glitch?
---
r/lootstars
---
But you lose trophies. Nobody in the right mind will sacrifice their trophies “for the better cause”.

#THERE’S A REASON STOPTHESPIN FAILED. YOU ARE IGNORING THAT ENTIRE THING AND PRETENDING IT NEVER EXISTED. THIS IS MY LAST MESSAGE TO YOU BECAUSE YOU JUST DON’T GET IT, LIKE I HAVE TO TYPE IN ALL CAPS FOR YOU TO EVEN COMPREHEND ANYTHING.
---
Nice shots bro
---
Proe
---
Nah. Skins are purely cosmetic and don't affect gameplay, so they need to be exclusive for Supercell to make money (if they do t make money, they won't update the game).
---
Beyond that, you can get free gems from boxes, so what's the issue?
---
I understand why it would be hard, because of the four corners with eight people in all, which I think that it would make more sense if there were only two corners, even though it wouldn't look as nice. having eight people in the corners makes it very hard to have a defined middle, which may have been what you were going for, but if boxes were added, (which is probably a necessity for making it an official map) the people in the middle would just get all of the boxes while the people on the sides would be struggling to kill each other. If there were only two corners, with still two people in each, there would be six people in the mid, so more people fighting off for the boxes there.
---
Another good idea I think would be to have two little spots on the edges of the the map, directly across from each other, so that everyone would have to travel to the middle.
---
Its not, i need to use the poor old website that bugs 1/2 times ;-;
---
What? x4. I thkni thissbks raploi mkeas moar cents
---
It is.  Most people on this subreddit know about it by now.  Most popular youtubers have made videos about it by now.  It only happens below 3000 total trophies though.
---
Ahah I guess I didn’t see that or they changed it since I saw it lol
---
But u did the whole rambling thing, just because there isnt a flair, it doesnt mean that its not as implied
---
Yikes... Sounds like they had some bad players on their team
---
Leoff ahould be the super button
---
He aint wrong
---
The tanks/ throwers can just chill in the center while all the long range guys are outside lol
---
when is this skin gonna come out?
---
It's perfect. The shading, details, proportions are all perfect. Great job OP!
---
Thats unfortunate for both
---
Let's just say that your legendary chance is below the below average

Buys gems for gene :PPPPP

#YES BUT WHY ARE WE SCREAMING

Wtf, at this rate I’ll never get Spike it Crow

i thought new character gives more chance?

You know yousfafdfg can select which brawler and you want the camera to focus on by tapping the bottom right, right ?

You took the hassle to record the video but half of it is offscreen.
---
all i know it has 4 o's
---
Bruh
---
How you can play with Gene?
---
But Piper won't swear,so supercell have to change the animation
---
now im pondering...everything
---
Haha I feel like an asshole man I didn't even see that. Sorry bro
---
Don’t emulate. It’s against the rules and can get you banned.
---
rip, you were probably last
---
several people are typing
---
I main barley and I do quite well in showdown, it’s my favourite game mode. Honestly it’s not that unbalanced at all, yes there are many bulls and Shelly but just use the environment to your advantage and hit your shots. Not to hard
---
Niceeeeee
---
You should be hired at supercell just send this picture to them

Nice shading tho

Definitely, would like to see this as a feature.

Then spend more time on mobile

he a good boy but he dudnt sound too good

Teaming is done to get an advantage. If they then team up all against one person then that's dog, but what do you expect to have done about it. Purposely shooting own goals in brawl ball is just being a dickhead. Teaming is a part of the game, and not much can be done to prevent it. All you can do is basically just backstab or kill teamers. 
---
I did the rambling because people actually think mortis is trash. Thats it.
---
This map is so aids
---
The whole point if Dynamike is that he’s hopeless at close range
---
I can, that’s not the point
---
join whiskey bandits tbh, its the exact same as cactus and its probably more active

That would be the best case scenario.

you must be an incredible player, congratulations. but for normal people who want to play any Brawler on any map is not balanced, sure that most people have the same problem and agree with me
---
Not brag just a comparison
---
The only thing I really agree with is the boxes. Takes crow forever to break a box
---
Piper usually tries to heal up when below 40%, so it probably wouldn’t be very helpful

Just dynamike.

so accurate, idk why newbies always choose to push one character to 300
---
 you mean that POCO was screaming
---
You're too lucky...
---
The star power would probably have to add only 200 so it's not to broken for bull, but his star power was doo doo anyway.
---
And darryl
---
But it's always Jessie as the boss... Bc there is too many jessie
---
That’s not how that works
---
Thx for the inv, but I’m already in on

ALRIGHT, I can confirm that its related to losing 3 times in a row in play again then leaving to the lobby to ready up again. r i p 18 trophies.
---
That's because you can't. He opened a big box and lied telling it was a normal box.

I mean hes not wrong, you do fight bots in 50% of the game

Yeah XD

thats a Tarafic skin

Any Brawler that comes after the Global Update (December 5, 2018) is not getting remodels unless it becomes necessary if I'm not mistaken. (Basically, Leon isn't getting a remodel.)

That’s the joke part of it. If you watched the emoji movie you will understand it. But if I can I’ll go ahead and change the flair anyway

Oh yeah, you’re that Darryl legend. I can’t use him. Can you give me some advice?

You use his shots to trap or push people back.

If you try to hard to damage people they will escape

Hope so

Lol yeah they released it broken and then broke the card in the other direction before it was fixed.

The new brawl balls matches actually last compared to the old one, making it more strategic and fun to play.

Looks awesome, one question....

Wheres the goal?

This isn’t a bug. If you’re interested in the technical side of this behavior, search up “backface culling”

This is terrible if you are at 40% health most likely it’s a shotgunner and you are already dead buuut I can see this work in a long distance battle

Technically it's more like Demoman's sticky jump since his sort of takes a second to setup the stickies then detonate, much like how Mike's dynamites have a bit of 1 or 2 second delay till they explode.
---
Though a TF2 reference here is always nice to see here for me. Love the game.
---
Picking a wrong brawler for the current map and teaming are completely different issues. SC said indeed that they classify teaming as a strategy, but not as far as it is now. At the community round table, it was said that teaming was a risky bussiness and that your teammate could backstab you at every moment.
---
Not happening. I down people to 500 hp, they have 4 power points, one of the other teamers has 5, and they spin hella fast en the low guy heals up. This is the shit people have to deal with. Causing players to betray wouldn't be a problem if teaming was so trusted and big, that's the issue. I can 1v3 if the 1v3 turns in a 1v2v1 a'd eventually 1v1v1, but not if the 1v3 becomes a 1v5.
---
¢σиgяαтѕ тσ уιу тσσ

---
One tip Plz no play with randoms
---
Play with a team instead
---
The waiting time for you increases even more when you have El Primo with 10+ gems in your team attacking 3 opponents. The second he loses all the gems, you only have what seems like 2 seconds to get everything back. 
---
Not to flex but I just pushed mortis same mode and was killing the bullys (bull/shelly/Leon/every other brawler who mortis cannot kill) lol push center stay close to box's when people start attacking dash pick up power up and hit them they will most likely auto fire hitting the next box

Me as Piper With super

Bye have a Great time

Ton petit cerveau de jus de fions de pute est en pleine ébullition juste parce qu'au fond tu sais que c'est toi la problème mais tu ne souhaites la reconnaître.
---
I love the photo but theres one minor, minor added detail. Darryl has 3 “fingers”
---
Did someone say KFC?
---
neat tf2
---
It’s in my head
---
#animated in my soul
---
I lost 2 times with Darryl, 2 with Brock, 1 with Rico and finally won with Rico.
---
I was with randoms at 7,5k tr (~350 per brawlers), yet i'm not frustrated about this, i know that i have to find a solid party to gain tr.
---
And also your teammate with all the gems decides he wants to suicide
---
I've always felt he needed a nerf, he's such a versatile brawler. Maybe his fire rate could be lowered.
---
I am a grown man, and I can tell if I made a mistake in my actions. You didn't point out a single issue that I made to overcome my struggles with getting a win.
---
I'm a global player
---
Still 1000 trophies and 4 brawlers more from my best score friend in school.
---
The update removed all one tile gaps, so when you destroy one skull it destroys the nearest wall in order to prevent a one tile gap on either side.
---
You should've spent it on token doublers. Also, every once in a while you get an offer in the shop to buy cards for gems (legendaries) or a random brawler from a certain rarity.
---
I lost a lot more than one match, believe me.
---
well, with your attitude and how you speak I think  you are a stupid child apart this is a game if you do not like it you can uninstall the game whenever you want :)
---
His fire rate didn't get an increase at all after this last update. Only visual changes to his bullets to make them cool cleaner. What ever you see as faster is just a placebo effect from the cleaner looking bullets.
---
It's frank not colt
---
Yeah Ik but they do look faster than normal yeah?
---
it's a bug supercell is aware of an is working on a fix. The skills shouldn't affect walls.
---
stop auto-aim
---
best brawlers for this map should be : Colt, Rico, Brock, Penny, Jessie, Dynamike, Darryl but you can win with others too (maybe not poco and mortis)
---
no strat tips if you play with random, just try again
---
with a team, someone may stay to defend near the safe
---
My point. You didn't win from the first try. I too changed brawlers. I tried Darryl, Brock, Primo, Jessie, Barley and Colt. I lost 37 trophies in total and gained 5, which is absurd. You have 7.5k, I have 2.5k. Players at your level are much more experienced, so getting a good queue isn't that hard.
---
Dude, the new heist map is great. I suggest using a team composition of two long range brawlers, maybe Piper and Brock, and one tank, El Primo. 
---
Needless to say if you are pissed and on a losing streak take a break from the game or at least the game mode. 
---
If you need someone to push trophies with let me know.

He’s not because I just check his profile and he hasn’t done anything since that game.
---
I cant stop laughing
---
No matter if it’s someone like you mention, or someone who evenly levels up their brawlers, teaming is still a big issue. 
---
I mean he is nearer the center of the map and he will survive
---
That is exactly what supercell does....Realeasing a good to very good rare character....waiting for everyone to buy it....then nerve it....rinse and repeat
---
You should have included a mindless low effort meme for visibility.
---
Supercell made it clear that teaming is fine since your "teammate" can betray you 
---
Lol xd
---
Same
---
Lolololololol
---
In my case I have about 1 good game out of 2 or 3. Of course depending on the opponents (and my form)
---
It’s a team game so everyone is at fault for the loss. Yes, some more than others at times but it doesn’t mean those who did the “least worst” shouldn’t be punished. 
---
You might finally be out if you’re lucky, usually not tho
---
I dont get it...
---
Lol
---
oh yeah i didnt realize that the island wastnt the middle
---
Yeah tried but i was alwys dead so i decided ti puch corners

---
The whole purpose of adding skins is to make the game more f2p friendly while still being able to take money. If you make in-game content that does not affect gameplay free, we would reverse and have a p2w system. 
---
It's not a secret, if you want to look pretty you have to pay! 
---
You make +300 damage per shot
---
You could have maybe won. Once you saw him charging at you, you could return to the safe zone and kill bull ones he comes back with almost no health
---
NOOOO ITS A SOLO SHOWDOWN ITS NOT A STRATEGY YOU DUMBASS I HATE THESE COMMENTS TEAMING NEEDS TO BE STOPPED IT ISNT FAIR!!!!!!!

AND BTW NOONE LIKES IT EVEN THE YOUTUBERS DONT LIKE IT SO STOP!!!!

I’d put bones around it since that glitch where with like anyone you shoot bones and most things around it just shatter
---
Only for Piper, too OP for bull tho 
---
Maybe it hasn't come out for your version of the play store, that's what happened with the Google play store.
---
Stopping the teamers from winning by essentially cheating.
---
And I’m sorry that you can’t support your argument
---
I appreciate the effort by u/PrestonALewis explaining it but i agree boxes actually do give you more health and I’m pretty sure he was just trying to refer to the power drink and typed cubes instead. Nice spelling error dont woosh me
---
Open more boxes. It is not a bug
---
Serves em right
---
You are a genius!
---
/s
---
There dont know how to change brawler
---
You deserve it if you team.
---
#StopTheSpin
---
They are different issues, but sometimes (e.g. like this) one of the issues leads to the other. I.e. picking a Brawler that is not suited for a map can cause people to team upon that Brawler for an easy kill.
---
When it comes to teaming, as far as I know SC has said that it's a strategy thus they are fine with it, they never specified that it's only fine as long as you backstab someone that has 500 hp left. If the teamers decide that it's worth keeping on teaming after one of them has low health then it's a strategy they are willing to continue on. Since there's no communication it's extremely risky to trust the other teamer if one of them only has that little HP left.
---
This doesn't mean that I agree with teaming, but it does mean that I can accept that teaming is happening and there's nothing I can do about it. There's a reason why I only play Solo Showdown at low trophies, and at higher I focus on the other game modes. :)
---
That’s exactly my thought! The new lvl packs suck .. 
---
It can make other people waste their supers. Like shelly.
---
You probably don't play much, been playing since November 2018 and I'm at 3.8K
---
Its not a bug
---
Seems like people are panicking that it was a problem so teaming out of fear or frustration therefore creating a bigger problem
---
Unblock the safes?
---
Ah I see it now, thanks 
---

---
This is not accurate because *Ricochet is ded*
---
Poco is S, and Colt should be A at best
---

I like how we already have a map named Excel

Remove the one tile gaps and it'll be good.
---
Well good, but killing them?
---
*PHOTOSYNTHESIS*
---
Why did you get so many downvotes?
---
I'm pretty sure i opened more than a hundred boxes, this is not one of those posts "oh i don't have a legendary", it's because i noticed this on both my main and my f2p account and a friends. This hasn't increased in a long time.
---
If Support said there's nothing wrong, why do you post here then? It will not change anything
---
ofcourse they do :)
---
Or is she... *shella* pissed? 
---
Ok I’ll see myself out
---
U understand me dont cha??
---
So now asking for questions is crying? Maybe you should stop giving dick answers?

Wow that took me awhile.

---
damn unlucky man
---
I think he means star powers lol
---
Ifkr 
---
excuse me youre not permitted to say that without a flair
---
How much trophies do you have?
---
Do you ever take account of effective range, hitbox, movement speed, maps? On paper they sound powerful but there are other factors.
---
ONLY MORTIS GOES THERE U BIG DUM
---
Hahaha natuurlijk niet
---
does it work smooth ? wonder if there are not any issiues with the framerate especially in showdown and maps where many things happen at the same time
---
Lucky guys. Im at 4000+ trophies and still dont have frank.
---
Because mortis ofc
---
the picture you made looks beautiful! great job!
---
Is he krumping or doing orange justice. I'm gonna say krump
---
You are fake
---
but its level 100 pack you should be maxed by then
---
No nose
---
Nvm he has a negative karma score on both his accounts, he can no longer comment or post images

Don’t have a replay but have a pic

This is sosad. I always get annoyed when I match wif bull Shelly and primo that have less than 1000 total trophies 
---
Lol according to the flairs Mortis is talking to Jessie about quantum physics.
---
lmao he aint lying

You can only say that if you have mortis

I’m interested in the team comp that you got that with

El suprimo

It takes a little less skill than it used to but still takes some skill
---
U can dl brawl stats , and it will show ur highest trophies reached on each brawlers 
---
I team in showdown 
---
As Mortis you try to avoid people as much as possible (except for barley and dynamike because you can easily kill them)
---
Here are some Tips:
---
(1) you can easily attack brawlers under 3000HP with only 3x attacks. (guaranteed from a level 4 Mortis)
---
(2) go away if someone who is stronger is approaching you, Take as little risk as possible if you trying to get some some power-cubes.
---
(3) use your Dash to move faster away from enemies
---
Franks jacket: *i dont feel so good*
---
Progress entails more than just getting a new Brawler. If you have all your Brawlers maxed with Star Power and still are missing other Brawlers then yes, it's understandable. But majority of the players haven't maxed all of their Brawlers power, so getting power points counts as progress, albeit a slow one.
---
If Bull survives mid he can super off the island
---
2 days  Ago i didnt even have an Epic lol
---
This is a very weird comment, but could you revert the profile picture for barley to what it used to be? I think that the old one looks much better. Thanks
---
Aaahhhaaha 
---
That’s hot 
---
But in actuality that’s nice but don’t mix Clash with Brawl Stars 
---
(We don’t need the game to end up more like €la$h Ro¥al£.) 
---
I got Mortis some weeks ago and i haven't got a single point for him in any brawl box. "Betrayal!"
---
fish can roll
---
Stop yourself 
---
True, but forcequitting the game also clears it, so it's just a temporary solution. :)
---
Yes but it's even more rare than brawl boxes though. And it's not really that much worthy compared to a brawl box on the long period
---
That skull explosion thing was a bug? huh.
---

No, but the lolipop is powerfull.

Does anybody else think auto aim should be disabled? At least no auto aim in bushes 
---
I was asking myself the same question
---
What TOTAL TROPHIES??? So what you are saying is if a start a new account and only play shelly i will be able to push her to more thank 1k Because i play with Other people at 1k(im at 11k total on main) This is game Breaking AND will Destroy the specific brawler learderboard IF used 
---
#EEEEL PRIMOOOO
---
yes 
---
Thanks for the clarification. Can you provide some insight on the match making. Let's use an example.
---
Player one has total 10k trophies. He unlocks gene who is at zero trophies. Will he be matched up against people with 10k trophies or just brawlers with zero to low trophies?
---
Need to earn 500 trophies with a champ 
---
[So this is the end of push exploit... :)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0Z4STg9qJI)
---
They going to finally add genie 
---
Wizz
---
I still have a habit to autoaim my super if I'm in a panicky-mode. What really grinds my gears is that, e.g. Shelly's super, if you autoaim it and you are within a hitting distance of a box, the auto-aim will prioritise the box instead of a player.
---
(Yes, I know that I'm bad when I use autoaim with my super, I'm not saying it's the game fault. It is my fault, and I'm frustrated about my own playstyle and not the game mechanic)
---
It looks like it
---
What's wrong? 
---
Lol this is insane
---
Does anyone else has this problem? 
---
{bring(life.leech) back.()
---
}
---
Yes I know that feeling, but we still can get Gene from boxes and skins offers are very rare for me (at least for this skin). This is ther right time because I have some spare gems for Gene too (390ish when this offer showed up). Might have to top up more for Gene if I even like him.
---
But yeah, if you are not sure don't buy it
---
Me and my Girlfriend use low-end devices to play the game (Asus Aenfone 3 Max zc520tl and LG K4 2017 respectively) and after the first February update we are experiencing bad issues when we try to play the game. The first two games we enter the game works well, but after not much time the game starts to slowdown and sometimes before the match starts it crashes. Oblying us to restart the game only to see that we lose. Its a lot frustrating because before that update the game was running pretty smooth and without any issue. We believed as some of you said on twitter that the update would make the game better on low-end cell, but it only got worse. We really like the game and this problem is ruining our fun. Please give us some attention.
---
Sorry for any mistake, its not my native language.
---
Yep
---
Brawlers left: 2.
---
#EEEEL PRIMOOOO!!
---
Why. 
---
And you're proud?!?!?!
---
I had the same problem but it's like this
---
Every 3-4 starts later the music is already shut off and I've to turn it back on.
---
It's probably a bug but irritating hopefully they sort it out.
---
I can just imagine supercell adding this into the game on April fools 
---
Whats wrong there? The 1st game misses perfect trophy equality by 1 and the 2nd game miss by 6... Stop the whining please
---
If there was a Darryl skin that was literally a realistic cat i would want it
---
u/brawl_stars 
---
U can suck leon's loli... pop
---
There are some maps that i have never played on ranked
---
I knew someone was gonna mention it 😂
---
What does this mean exactly? If someone has 10k total trophies and they want to use a brawler who has 200 trophies who will they be matched up with as opposed to the the old matchmaking.
---
Note: you have to be under 3000 total trophies for this to work
---
Bull musclehead
---
u/brawlstars
---
I updated the post with a link.
---
I think it should optionally be disabled. 
---
It’s a habit that screws me over more than it helps me. 
---
That's the point 
---
Even if I turn the music on, I only get the menu music. The moment I queue into a match - it turns itself off automatically.
---
I definitely would hate it, especially if my parents would see it.. 😳
---
Thank you!
---
This is an amazing idea and art! Love it.
---
Cool skin and concept!
---
No, Clasharama is the single most horrendous, ugliest art style I’ve ever seen professionally done
---
And i feel like Paperman when i use crow
---
Because 
---
But if youre maxed coins are useless, nothing to do with them, i need leon and 10k coins is more than enough
---
Haha and you lost to them
---
This is really impressive 
---
I used darryl as bull in the begining but realised he was dying too soon.
---
i was experiencing too after 28 january update....
---
for this i lost like 1k trophies...  dont know when its going to fix up...but Hope, After this update it will be fixed😭
---
It's an old video -_-
---
Supercell Doesn’t like V-P-N.
---
On my phone (Galaxy S7) the app once just fucking closed when I was in showdown and there was only one enemy left... lost no trophies, but still damn annoying. I guess this is a memory leak, and the system decided to kill the app because memory was too full or something.
---
They didn't actually fix anything. i just played against a power 10 with 9k trophies while the highest on our team was me at 5.4k.
---
L
---
thanks, I'm very happy that you like it!
---
Damn this is such a cool idea
---
How did you make the skin?
---
I’d say yes but I’m gonna wait until spike comes out so I could have all 3 legendary brawlers
---
It's almost a term for practice really, or generally passive player in a mission
---
In brawl , I'd say a character only Super dependant.
---
I'd assume why Tara is labeled that. Her super matters most but Tara is weak on her own but she's quick.
---
Similar to Darryl. He relies on his super. He simply runs around and can only really hit someone with his super or he dies trying to basic attack and chase a guy 
---
That is the issue because of organized teaming because you recognize each other there are people who went into showdown with pre determined teams and would work together to shut down other top players 
---
*inhale*
---
#photosynthesis 
---
They are so rare but surely you will get all if you keep going
---
Is matchmaking based on total trophies or trophies worth the brawler that you’re playing with? 
---
well xmas i was playing 24/7, now im at 6.5k (i spent real money, that helps a lot)
---
They should atleast let her charge her super faster
---
"no way!" 
---
I guess that you lost
---
I don't get why would you make play again only available at 150 trophies and above.
---
Why did brawl ball spawn time get increased so long? It was in healthy place where it was and maybe even +1 second was fine but 7 second respawns time is insane.
---
Jump on a Shelly is all it takes to intentionally lose. 
---
Sí
---
DUDE i swear i thought of that yesterday, it makes so much sense. I didnt bother posting coz i cant make the draw/design tho xD GJ
---
Removed. Rule 3. No providing information on how to break Supercell Terms of Service.
---
Enjoy your megabox lol
---
This is not accurate, max level bull deals more damage than a max level leon
---
Umm, you right, I'm gonna do it again for better use for the bush
---
Amazon Primo: Where we slam the package onto you
---
I didn't realize that her star power only worked at max distance. It definitely wouldn't work then.
---
Shit you’re right
---
I think it would be very fair
---
Thanks, I hate it.
---
Why not?
---
Would have been better on a mine sweeper type of meme
---
Leon pulled a kakashi
---
Oh ok
---
That’s bullism
---
"Laugh out loud out loud", I see 🤔
---
Haha man!!! 😂 this is the first time I'm team in this game but watch until the end because something bigger than teaming! It is my best match ever I've played in Brawl Stars! 😉
---
Btw I hate teaming so much! 
---
So grinding individual brawlers to high levels will be easier now? 
---
So improved
---
I also want this to be clarified maybe it will first try to find players that are in the same pool and have the same brawler cups. So you would first gave other people with 0 cup brawler  10k total cups. Then as the matchmaking takes longer the requirements will lower. What this means is that when a new brawler is added to a game for example Jean you won’t be able to annihilate noobs because many top players will have boxes ready to unlock him and you will just end up playing with them. 
---
I mean we won regardless but playing against two Pocos is very annoying..
---
What is
---
Nita is the most auto aiming 
---
*feature
---
I mean you get like five kills a then you end up 4th and get like 2 trophys. 😢
---
Yeah that’s a problem you should be getting 7 trophies for that
---
This bush is occupied 
---
But it's top 10 hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
---
It does work on the rest of the game modes but it’s not the same as you have teammates. I can definitely see people getting triggered over his name though.
---
r/woooosh
---
What does it mean play again is now enabled over 150 trophies??
---
No I just like to actually have fun with the game. You are probably someone who teams and camps in showdown, that’s it. And you think you are actually good at the game but you’re not.
---
Oi italiano 
---
Just a Shelly talking to herself?
---
Singed and tweeted 
---
Nope, Stealing kill was not the only way to heal. If you damage other player, you would get damaged amount of health back! And I would use this strategy to keep myself alive till the end.. chip some health and run, cause now you would have more health than opponent and he will have to fight to survive!
---
I also saw some people just hiding in bush, but this was the most stupid thing to do in this mode.
---
I think the only player who would complain are those who couldn't shoot player while dodging bullets (which is the whole game basically- shoot and move)
---
Nah it completely changed. Cuz usually wif my 400 colt I face a lot higher total trophies player and I checked jz now all of them only hv 2k total trophies. And the problem is the variety of the brawler is so similar. I played like 4 or 5 more games, there are only tanks and colt and sometimes dyna becuz of it. Feels strange 
---
r/redditlosers

Yes

this map can be better than hot maze ( it is my opnion).

And also:

How did you downloaded It?

And spike is about to become the Devilsknike

There are kids here

Awesome! Thanks for the reply! :)

Comment of the Year

nah he does not fit the skirmisher class either
---
Fix the characters not the trophy pushing and the map maybe if more characters where good people wouldnt have to trophy exploit i didnt even know of this trophy exploit and im at 3400 trophies i play regularly have 16 brawlers even put money into your game but some of the characters just have WAY TOO BIG of a disadvantage and everyone knows this there just in denial
---
Put the bunny back in the box
---
and new skin means its a new skin for you
---
I'm at 8k and my friends started to play like a month ago. Guess i'm never going to play with them again, thanks SC very cool :)
---
Thats because the progession is slow
---
Troll potential?
---
😂
---
Just If u can't see its leon with 23 cubes
---
Your logic is so severely flawed. Yeah, I get it, you get more trophies for finishing 2nd than last. But you're also a bitch for finishing 2nd AND teaming. So congrats on that, but you're still shit at the main points of the game. 
---
&gt; Showdown you get more trophies for SURVIVING, nothing else. 
---
Except for... gee... I don't know... *winning?*  
---
&gt;So if Poco realizes he stands no chance ~~against Frank~~ in Solo Showdown
---
FTFY
---
&gt; Teaming. Is. A. Strategy. Get over it KID. 
---
Teaming. Is. A. **Flawed.** Strategy. Get over it 2nd place bitch. 
---
\*primo
---
Then you must play friendly battle because the normal battles are really competitive and if you want to have fun with your friends the normal battles i don't recommend you the normal battles
---
He was never a trash can, I see him pretty powerful since before the update
---
Btw spike can deal over 4k damage per hit if he stands in the right spot close to safe. 
---
This is a brilliant idea! It works because rascals are sadly only used in mortar decks :(
---
Darryl is not like the other shotgunners, how dare you say his name in vain
---
Ur trash.. you can get rank 15 easily with a lvl 1 crow.. just because you cant play him doesnt mean hes bad so stop complaining and start to get gud
---
I have read many comments saying: why are you balamcing brawlers while the game itself has many problems!?
---
This is new.
---
And if you lose?
---
How about you focus on playing the game it was made to be played. Yeah glitches come and I have no problem with someone using it. But to get mad the glitch is gone? That’s a cry baby complaint.  And imagine if they didn’t fix it. You’d have 50% of the players at 11k that’s why I didn’t do it. Not worth it.
---
My shelly is stuck at 380 power 7 any tips
---
Happens every time. Even if they have other boxes near them they always go for me... like jeez leave me alone
---
The bots are in fact very good. They don't suicide with gems. Try it with one of your friend, it is so good on el primo that we farmed trophies this way
---
Well then I'm very lucky man to increase my trophy by 1500 when this mode came in cycle(in a single day)... Also if you didn't know, heart did not drop in this mode since global Release ( i started playing after release) .. It had changed alot since beta (i read beta post). Also i didn't play duo i was solo queing. .. there might be less player in duo but high player database in solo.. also i played in all trophy range till rank 20 (from 0 to 500).
---
Do you know what game theory is? Lol
---
If he is your top 3 most used yea but if not nah
---
Now this is what i like to see
---
Guessing just like the term skirmish, he only focuses on short fights, rolling in, scoring the kill, then out
---
i mean.. at least 8 days, isn't that enough?
---
What an ass why would anyone even do that? 
---
Wtf man i always use regular attac and miss the fucking super
---
Before some people start saying i edited it: I did not. I opened it twice, and also turned on and off the music to show that its not edited. Its the music of the game, i didnt edit the video.
---
Auto Aim aims to the middle of the goal when u have the ball
---
Same here.
---
I remember this one from a couple of weeks ago
---
Finally a total trophies based matchmaking, thanks Supercell!
---
It is a very good game but they would like you to fix one thing, after the update of the Chinese lunar year when I start a game the game comes out only please fix it not only to me it happens but also to many more people
---
maybe paint? Also interesting name
---
split second v2
---
As a Colt main I approve this

I like the colt skin better but sure crow is good too
---
Congratulations Brother! Whats yer gamer tag?

---
Mortis health buff
---
Bo's n64 like model
---
Leon ammo regenerate decrease
---
Crow health buff
---
Remove water pools from brawl ball

Thank you Ryan for this statement. It's important to communicate stuff like this so we don't feel left alone with those things. ✌🏼
---
I forgot to change something but oh well
---
Are you guys able to go in the game? Mine is stuck on connecting to server
---
Smh means “shaking my head.” So you’re shaking your head your head?
---
Haha I do that too but I do the vice versa more often somehow 
---
Not particularly. But I'll defend it strongly because it works to everyone's advantage. I'll team when it's advantageous to me but don't get it twisted... You go down on health and I have an easy kill... Sorry bud, that's solo SD. You play the hand you are dealt. I'll also take advantage of players running away from someone else and take them out... Not teaming but basically the same thing. That's solo SD. It doesn't need to change, but a new game mode would be a great addition. More solo activities and a new game mode would give all these people upset about teaming a something else to do where they can't complain about anything other than their own lack of skill. I'm proposing fixes to help everyone and all these people seem to focus on is banning players who didn't play "fair". 
---
it doesn't take too long to reach 400 trophies. just keep grinding and playing consistently to level up your brawlers
---
You'll never get Crow :'
---
The trophy exploit is this 
---
There was a exploit where if you kept all your brawlers below 300 and pushed just 1, you could get up to 1200 trophies on that 1 brawler alone
---
https://youtu.be/RFNYSPrfv80
---
I think it's fine the way it is, no need to change things (although it would be better for me because I'd have etter chances to get Crow)
---
That’s not the exploit, this is https://youtu.be/RFNYSPrfv80
---
Why did you show the entire map?
---
idk if this is sarcasm or not but 6 Shellys and 2 bulls against a primo
---
I’m pretty aware of the changes. I’ve been playing since 2 weeks after beta release. When I started playing they didn’t even have brawl ball as a game mode. I’ve witnessed all the changes and maybe you enjoyed your push but it’s not a good game mode overall. 
---
...And 1500 trophies in a day in showdown life leech I strongly doubt that. Assuming you’re low trophy and don’t lose any winning 7 trophies per game that’s 214 wins in a day (in a row). At the average of 4 minutes per showdown play that’s 856 minutes or 14 hours assuming you don’t take breaks to eat or shower lmao. Maybe I’m missing something but that’s pretty bad for your health pal. 
---
Sans undretale
---
Snas undertlae
---
It probably depends on trophy level - I see quite a few people walk right into a Bull, Primo, or Shelly bushcamping.  I take second in a lot of solos because I'm going up against a 15 power Bull, not much to do about it when the map closes in.
---
Because I do

Beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep

Oh I thought you were talking about the trophies, that makes sense.

---
what?
---
I mean entire game
---
Thats JUSTICE... Nice work my man
---
Im against teamers as well
---
How's it feel to play 24/7 too? 
---
I was speaking about trophy games. Boss battle and robot I don’t even count those as a real game mode. 
---
wanted to show how normal games are like now
---
Have you played it enough to see the differences? Because it's possible that it can be inspired
---
I play 25/7, dude
---
Or you don't have an editing software?
---
Im lazy like some :(
---
So now if I want to play with my new brawler (Rank 0 - power 1) and I have 3000 total trophies in my account, I will be matched with other players who have 3000 trophies but playing with old brawler ( Rank 12-16 - power 4-6)  
---
Is that how the new matchmaking system works?! or I am wrong. 
---
The servers must be down, what region are you in? It might be a worldwide error
---
Wait lets use the sign language so he can see u-OH FUCK HE IS DOING THE BIRDBOX CHALLENGE HE CANT SEE US
---
Yeah I'm not going to be able to play with my son now....
---
I thought so, but it's okay! :D
---
I totally agree with you, the kills should be rewarded 
---
Well it was almost 1500... I didn't exactly remember or did math while typing... But i did tell you that i brought shelly and tara to rank 19 while and piper rank 20 in a day.
---
No star powers do not affect anything
---
The random part was bad though. Sometimes it worked, sometimes it didnt. I killed someone because i destroyed his wall once. But only once it mattered. 
---
Well, I think you should consider how utterly amazing it is to get 9 kills. 
---
Average kills is around 2-4 if you’re proactive, and it’s always going to change depending on the brawler you play. Even an aggressive crow can’t do much damage, unless you’re literally abusing range and you have a lot of time.
---
So the progression is decreased actually, encouraging people to go out there and get kills. That way, the kill count is actually more spread out. With your example of +4 trophies for 1st place, 8 or 9 trophies gained with 4/5 kills is still fair. 
---
I don’t know what SD you play, but that kill count is already a challenge to achieve without someone else punishing you for trading health with the person you just killed.
---
The Play Again change is interesting, I think they should have a way to exit play again though, sometimes I will either accidentally press it or someone has to leave and you're stuck starting another game when you wanted to leave (maybe a way to stop if someone leaves and isn't in your party)
---
That’s pretty good. To each their own I guess. I wouldn’t mind life leech being back we always have other game mode choices anyways. Personally I’d rather avoid it. Maybe I’m just not good at it. 
---
Well, yeah you care about money so you need to care about the community that gives you the money lol.
---
😂😂😂😂
---
Howcome Ive never tough of that! 
---
I think you will be playing with other people at 300 trophies, but using brawlers at low ranks. More like current matchmaking but improved
---
Sorry if this has been asked... But have these maintenance changes already been applied? 
---
Congrats
---
Screw you un-teamers!
---
Yeah I definitely picture her as being like 12 or something. I still like OP's drawing though
---
Mid February. Can't you understand that?
---
This community is nice
---
AahH ! :(
---
Then just leave the game... not like they care about you
---
isnt it compensation enough when they accept the skins and maps? 
---
That's even funnier than 24 😂
---
I said this a week ago tho...
---
Ewwww dirty words 😡
---
Matchmaking¿??????¿??????¿?
---
This was stolen and is a repost of a stolen fortnite meme. This clearly makes no sense unless it’s duo showdown but only a bit
---
Is not of cheat but of the strategy ! FU\*\* O\*\* !
---
#leon confirmed Lele Pons
---
She’s not fucking funny
---
Brock shouldn't do that. It is just stupid.
---
Mortis doesn't need a health buff
---
Every brawler will get a remodel obviously
---
Same brawler twice isn't that common and isn't that big of a issue
---
Teaming is another strategy and won't get removed
---
They are fixing water in brawl ball
---
Point taken; I haven't developed the requisite aiming skill on my phone to play long range brawlers effectively.
---
Definitely not. Most guys here spend hours designing for free. Meanwhile the designer that works for Supercell prob makes $80K/year. But all he does is steal ideas and bring them to life. The idea/draft design is worth more money than copying the work and producing it. 
---
Xdd
---
I threw this together in a haste. I meant PowerPoints to be used as you seE fit such as the ones on trophy road. You buy/assign. Or maybe even stockpile  however you see fit. 
---
Me once 3 months, and I had left Pam, Frank and Spike on those moments
---
Wow....freak'in trolls man. That's not cool. 
---
It takes like 2 seconds to back out and load in again
---
As someone who is decent to not that good at the game but tries to grind overall tropies,  I kinda need one since most of my brawlers are rank 10
---
Yeah, now i see, it wasnt there earlier
---
Not so much,if he doesn't have more than 3 power ups
---
One thing is a brawl box, mega box, tickets gems etc...those things would never be in a reward system as they make a profit out of that...but 10 tokens...seriously that u say they will lose money for 10 miserable f*ing tokens.
---
Wow 2 full seconds, must be exhausting. 
---
Sometimes some randoms make me very angry.
---
Damn,  that's a long time
---
As a Nita main, this hurts 
---
Having 31 boxes ready to open?
---
legendary brawler that has about average everything with a super that is a beam or something and if it hits a brawler friendly or opposing will become a clone like the clash royale style clone of the hit brawler for 20 seconds unless killed before mimicking their attack super speed health every for that period of time except for their star power. Mimics or Mickey or Michael or Murry or Mirry or Marry thinking Mirry star power would be when super hits brawler they take 20 or 30 percent of the brawlers power and gain 10 or 20 percent more power could look like a light blue blob and when super is used forms into clone if brawler. Just thought of this on the blue
---
i know how you feel anyway i was stuck with 2 epics at 6000 trophies
---
I had same thoughts when I killed two, then playerA killed me, I got -4 for 8th place, and playerB got +6 for sitting patiently in the bush till the showdown
---
I didnt mean to comment on your comment just on the post😅 i deffenitly agree with you though (dont hate on my english im not from an english speaking country)
---
They don’t even look alike. Y’all just racist.
---
*Sees random black guy*
---
“Hey, it’s Brock!”
---
Haha!! Got you. No worries :) 
---
Instead of having a report button, you could have a button to block the person so that they can not add you, and no longer appear in your team, etc ...
---
Also D.R.O.N.E means Dangerous Remotely Operated Navigable Explosive 
---
Doesn't make sense. If they loot your kill, you get the power cubes top...
---
I have already 80 boxes for Gene 🤣
---
Naw wait for a Leon deal
---
Maybe
---
how big is he
---
Get 4th place once and move on
---
You are making me feel like I had experienced nothing,wow..... 
---
KoolKool
---
Legit thought this was about his decline in rarity from mythic to a free reward
---
I like this one
---
El Primo is everywhere.
---
Esa cosa es bien inútil
---
This is stupid
---
Thanks 
---
Niiiiice 
---
Hopefully, they'll add that feature, but rn it's not like that. 
---
It'S a ViAbLe StRaTeGy!
---
I wish it was fourth place 😪
---
I always do. Easy kill 
---
I need the replay of you winning that shit
---
What part the tilt or the power points lol
---
Important to keep in mind "animal" is a placeholder name and doesn't mean anything. Leon is "ninja" in the files and Pam is "minigunner", but they don't mean anything.
---
“i know how sd should be but i dont actually play sd hurr durr”
---
turn it on and off again worked for me
---
no. change him to "needs a buff". I DONT CARE IF EVERYONE IS SAYING DARRYL DOESN'T NEED A BUFF. he needs a buff. his damage is trash and if he wants all of his bullets to hit he has to be inside of his opponent. the reason that's an issue is because he has low health
---
Actually primo instead of daryl
---
Dude, you didn't make this. u/Crocthereptile did
---
Xd
---
is that mike
---
f###
---
This makes no sense. Auto aim god is making fun of how absurd auto aim is and his club clearly tells supercell to fix their game. This is what everyone wanted so I’m sure if anything he’s glad.
---
I’m in love
---
teamers\*
---
Exactly, since he is called heavyweight, people use him like bull so they think he’s trash. But he’s a lot more of an assassin 
---
I don't get why people do that...
---
this is legit good enough to be in the game nice job
---
Gonna make a post about levels milestones now 😂
---
But what If he was actually lagging, and this whole time he be spamming the attack button?
---
No!! because people will find that the brawler has already been released and will open their boxes
---
Love it
---
The BEST plays happen below 300 trophies...  I'm being dead serious.  Great strategy.
---
Any suggestions. I feel it could be better
---
The center is a bit too closed up but great overall
---
I kinda thought so too while drawing it but I wanted it to be as different from the default skin as possible, and so I gave it a shot
---
Well. Scorched stobe does not look like this one. Atleast for me 
---
Any suggestions? 
---
My sincerest condolences! 
---
Jeje... Very funny
---
Ask him that
---
Yea, could be tough luck. I really do not have the sample size to tell yet.  I may post again in a day or so and see if anything has changed for me.
---
#BUUULLLDOOOZEEEERR
---
Gaining 20 pts in 1 hour but losing your 21 pts suddenly in 3 matches when you decide to play solo showdown. Happens to me a lot because of teaming.
---
You good man?
---
Isnt it touchdown bull?
---
Teaming is a legitimate strategy according to Supercell
---
I didn't know lol. Is that a reference shit to something. 
---
Now I can't stomp complete newbs for 50 games after unlocking a new brawler?  I guess that is a good thing....
---
You got it
---
If Supercell will give us one trophie 4 every kill that we do teaming will desapear...
---
Just use el primo
---
Its soolking but i could resist drawing on his face and giving him braces
---
They didn't say anything about duo sd
---
You’re welcome! 
---
Solution is simple. Get report system and analyse videos sent by players. If necessary get ban.
---
You didn't get it...  :&lt;
---
I don’t want your help bro and if you are starting to coach today probably no one want your help😋 
---
WE WANT GENIE❤️❤️❤️
---
Actually, who did?
---
Suckulent
---
I'm probably worse than you but I think there are a few things that help. 
---
I'm a noob so I use auto aim  for most characters but I think, especially for sharp shooters, once you can manually aim well and lead your shots you will have a much higher hit rate. 
---
Since this is mostly a team game, the people you play with makes a difference.  If you only play with random people then there will be some games that you will lose no matter how good you are.  The pros per say probably play 80% of their games with teammates. To add to that they create teams that work well together based on current meta and are map specific. Think nova e sports.
---
Befriend people you think are good and join an active clan.  Start out by focusing on the characters you are good with of line to play until you are out of your league. 
---
It's kinda implied?  Just take your loss and do better next game
---
The thing is in my video i believe they did know each other before game starts. You can't even team against 5-men army. You know what im saying
---
I said over rank ten  reading is like super easy .....:
---
*Mexican guy enters classroom*
---
OP shouts #”EL PRIMO IS HERE”
---
the center grass is kinda useless since they don't connect, also it looks way too similar to feast or famine
---
It was far back from July 2018, mate. This theme was in the game from June 2017 to (very early) December 2017.
---
the dyna is 480 that’s why... is in in ur lobby with u?
---
You joking, right?
---
I said how sd should be? I guess that your capacity of read something it’s 0, but we are here to help you man, don’t give up!!!!
---
That wasn’t an accident, played on a team with that same guy and he did the exact same thing.
---
My language doesn’t choose English so I’m not sure.  And thank you for your correction!!!
---
Leon: Leon got nerfed!
---
are you the artist?
---
*Mexican guy enters classroom* 
---
Op shouts #EL PRIMO IS HERE!
---
No after the player dies to another one he would be removed and any damage he did won't count do the next player can kill him and take the trophy
---
Bruh_sound_effect_#11.wav
---
Thats his hair
---
Frank's jammin' his head to only the most golden of tunes in Brawl Stars.
---
Well. Central grass is formated that way to prevent from being very toxic toward long rangers just like feast and famine or caveb churn
---
. Similar in what way? Ang suggestion to improve it
---
Você faz umas skins top irmão, continua assim 
---
Skin teams don’t work on what you are asking for
---
❤it
---
Op shouts “EL PRIMO IS HERE!”
---
That Spike is real happy
---
Except that was a terribly low IQ play.
---
It is smilair but not that too similar 
---
Celebrated too soon...
---
nothing
---
&gt;your capacity of read something
---
Yo, I ordered that plush a week ago, but I don’t know where it is! How many days did you attend
---
?
---
Looks dope af man 
---
put a flair that says humour (look at my profile)
---
And instead of green or orange, his poison does red
---
Remember the fog looked scary and actually filled the map, now it’s super spaces out.
---
Oh no! I guess this people don’t know what is showdown about, when you start the match it says “Be the sole survivor” or “Be the damn guy that kill everybody”? If you want to down vote, please down vote with a opinion/critic well written and formulated ba bye
---
At least it doesnt have the rocket launcher
---
Kakashi, we new it was you underneath. 
---
Yeah it's difficult to dodge 10 dynamikes shots per second even with mortis...
---
Man... You have Mortis? He not is easy to play and he not kill bulls and shellys.
---
next thing they will add hats. wait no they are removing them.
---
Oh sorry, i didn't saw that you were the one that posted, when i read for some reason i though that you were someone that was pointing that out as an issue
---
But yes, but it could be more simple, idk. Removing the autoaim near Mortis would be hard to program, especialy for it to be used in only one bralwer. 
---
Brave of you to assume it’s a guy 
---
Wow! It really looks like something supercell would add to the game, good job :)
---
Ok ok the supercell balance this.
---
I like it, as long as you keep the current ranking trophies.  Discouraging teaming is higher on my priority list than removing campers.  
---
The time gets increased?!?!?!? *sad*
---
Wow! What a novel idea! I certainly don’t see this suggested __every day__
---
When there is a shelly, it is 100% try hard 
---
Purryl
---
Bc why can you jump non stop 
---
wow
---
Yeah about that they can also do it to you so its fair fight
---
Yeah, but i put those channels of water so long range brawlers can shoot in without bull being able to get them
---
I cant believe this got 700+ upvotes. 
---
What is this idea bringing to the game?
---
I like these changes and the speed at which they came out. However I would like to mention that ever since the lunar new year update my game’s been crashing when I load into a game on occasion. I’m sure this isn’t the first time you’ve heard about this, but I just thought it was worth mentioning.
---
**just like the P E E K A**
---
Not that much, right now he only strugles to kill shotgunners and Pam, a average/good Mortis player can take anyone out with not much strugle, he is stronger than ever if this new update, so good to play with him.
---
I hardly see them after I got higher up in trophies.
---
Also, check bushes.
---
cool but to much wasted space that would make it even cooler
---
True, bull require no skills they should nerf him
---
*_e p i c  a n t i  t e a m i n g _*
---
Soo, does that mean that you could get like 13-15 trophies if you kill everyone and get 1st place?
---
Well said
---
Wow totally not that website where you can play as gene!
---
U joking right? 
---
L u c k
---
It would be great if that was the case, specially for solo players.
---
Thank you for the clarification 
---
Bruh that’s how it’s gonna br
---
Very cool! It is a very restricted in the bases and that would change some strategies a little bit.
---
If mortis shouldnt die to bulls and shellys then which brawlers should he die to? BTW mortis would be much harder to play without auto aim dont you think?
---
He's the only reason i got this game in the first place
---
Love for that line which was for Pekka
---
It's all about trophies, isn't it..
---
Real talk
---
How? or just lucky that u came with another random Mortis?
---
Brave of us to assume its mortal being
---
That’s what the changes to pool party were for.
---
a*
---
People didnt have the medicine to treat the plague...so people dressed up like a plague docter and they would travel from village to village saying that they would heal the plague for a whole lot of money...of course they where fake tho and the plague killed millions
---
I say both are true, but I think this will result in a lot of brawl ball players choosing fighter class brawlers, rather than defensive brawlers.
---
Ok ok bad idea. Wow i no think you hate his much. Hehe
---
Thx lol
---
If you zoom in and look closely you can see it has some sort of cabines, so a strong guess that it's a Ferris wheel
---
Sounds fun, sadly everytime i play leon everyone tries to kill me.
---
Dynamike
---
Thanks, I hope supercell implements something like that down the line
---
no why
---
What he's thinking: "You know, I could charge into the enemy base when I have all the gems for that one extra kill." Amazing art btw!
---
How did you predict his movement????????????????????  
---
