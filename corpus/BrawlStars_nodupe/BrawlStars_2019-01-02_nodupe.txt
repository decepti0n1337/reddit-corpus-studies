You should try your best to really push everything as evenly as possible. The more total trophies you have, the faster your progression(more brawl boxes, coins, power points, levels, new brawlers). I‚Äôm not saying don‚Äôt push those brawlers you really like, but you still should play the brawlers you don‚Äôt like as much. It‚Äôs ok if they are Low rank, as Long as you get a feel for their mechanics, you‚Äôll get to play the brawler well in the future.
---
---
---
that seems about right 
---
Thanks satan! 
---

---
I disagree. Way too easy to exploit
---
Why not? Arcade games were ported to consoles back in the 80/90s  and there are already ported mobile games for the switch such as Arena of Valor.
---
Brawl Stars for the switch  makes more sense than Arena of Valor IMO
---
Thanks
---
Are you retarded?No doubt.
---
Phones are supposed to be off in the theaters ü§î
---
More balanced than power 4s with power 10
---
No it wont come out on switch, i would love for it to be on switch but, the switch is almost only Nintendo games, i don‚Äôt thing Supercell would do that
---
They should make a new box which you can only get skins out of
---
I only have 2 more, it‚Äôs not a lot. Supercell insist not giving me Mortis or Leon, I‚Äôm sad.
---
Why is the bottom so much further than the top to the gem spawner
---
It is a cool concept but if the bat shows the direction might be really OP. I feel that if it only shows when there is an enemy close it is suficient.
---
There was a situation after the Leon nerf when you could use invisibility eye to something similar to that. But is patched.
---
Great idea! 
---
The point is that it doesn‚Äôt run out. If you don‚Äôt play the game, your doubler is still there.
---
You stole my comment
---
This would be kinda op but would be nice to have Mortis buffed
---
This mad me laugh so hard!!! Lol i love Bart simpson!!! No homo
---
Also i think emotes should be a thing
---
Oh yes, i'm going to correct it
---
Dude they don't care. Stop posting this every day
---
Hard....
---
Push all brawler.
---
In Clash Royale, it can take up to 10 years to max an account and get every card without playing. On Brawl Stars, it takes at MAX a year and a half. It's pretty easy up until legendaries.
---
I guess you have to think again
---
Congrats man!!!!
---
This happens when I am charging my phone and it tops out at 100 or charger blinks on off for a split second. 
---
Nice
---
Skins... Well, for me at least
---
It would be nice to have a whole bunch of skins to chose from 
---
Thanks for all the answers I‚Äôll be sure to be updating on my progress
---
I know i auto aimed a bit, but that was because when a enemy is moving in a straight direction towards or away from me, i use the quick fire
---
Ahhh I remember OWNato, what happend to him?
---
that happens?  i gotta admit i have teamed in solo (not for cheating trophies i actually dropped quite a few) but in duos?!

---
No one should use auto aim unless the person is right next to you and running at you. If you autoaim you will miss a lot.
---
I don't like it. It could ruin the game mode. Imagine if it is in the walls right next to the safe
---
Stay as far from enemies as possible, don't auto aim much, and only play her in bounty. I think you've got her down.
---
Lmao
---
I have been playing since summer and have all brawlers besides from Spike and Leon. It takes quite a long time to get every brawler because as soon as you unlock one, your chances of finding another brawler from BB drop significantly.
---
For sure. We are ramping up our discussions but right now we are all a bit busy. The influx of global traffic and the holidays have made things a bit harder, but we don't plan to stop discussion posts any time soon.

Naturally they were happy and at the same time salty bcuz we 3 started since global and just play for fun.

Yes please I don't have anything with ''for a while'' like what is for a while??

Franks super says it stuns for a while but how do I know how long it will last. We really need this. Specific numbers rather than vague info.
---
Cool
---
I didn't know spike had a GF that was 34 years old. So spike isn't a lonely boi anymore. ;)
---
Or cousins
---
This is their total trophies lol
---
Not working now
---
Haha made a canadian apple ID all my friends who got it after it released treat me like a God
---
its already usable in all modes.
---
glad you agree, btw Frank's stun is 2 seconds
---
dude, this was already made, you know it
---
give this more upvotes
---
I really want that
---
thanks!
---
By the way that Primo wasn't throwing
---
He was actually trying to make it easier for y'all but you messed him up.
---
I don't know man. Those M&amp;Ms take this stuff seriously. 
---
Am i the only one that thinks he doesn‚Äôt need a nerf? 
---
7
---
I got 17.
---
what‚Äôs the font
---
true and sad... 
---
i‚Äòd still love to see throwable vision wards... bushchecking with that many bushes on the maps just leaves you without ammo against the campers... and in addition to that, the tanks (bull and primo) do even outrun you.
---
Why would you post his number?
---
Well, they did it with fortniteüòè
---
I'm hard now 
---
The clear of those two boxes was hard to watch lol.
---
Btw not the best Darryl gameplay I‚Äôve seen, but the tips are mostly good. Darryl is a fun and viable imo. Could use a slight buff but he is not as useless as people say. I like him.
---
I saw a random online whose name was Big Chungus, needless to say it was pretty ebic
---
The nostalgia, but what‚Äôs up with lil pump, I still have him as friend, he currently has 5/6k trophies
---
I just wanted to do this cause some people say he's bad.
---
Use him as an assassin for lower health brawlers. Don‚Äôt ever go up to a bull or Shelly as Darryl . Use him to dash towards a lobber with no super, or on a long ranged brawler like piper or Brock but be careful on other brawlers super. If played right Darryl can dash in with super , three shot a penny or Jessie if they don‚Äôt use their turrets, and have your super again in time to dash away from any incoming brawler. Darryl isn‚Äôt the best brawler but he is a janitor . Bull only is good at close range. Period. If you see a bull approaching run away or dash away bull will give up. I‚Äôve played Darryl and was able to take out a team in showdown with him. Darryl you must use auto aim and only when on top of a brawler. Again don‚Äôt ever go up to a bull or Shelly or even Tara/Leon because almost every other close ranged brawler will shred Darryl. You MUST wait for an opportunity. Always.

I haven't tried him with his star power, does he get any better? I do have a lot of fun playing with him, but it's true that I feel that he sucks a bit. :( 
---
#stopthebullhatealright

Yeah that would be nice. Also just maybe a faster unload time cause his shots take forever

I messed up on clearing those boxes lol

o yea I did see that but acculy thats not the post that inspired me, it was a post of someone showing off the 2nd UI, If you look at my comments you will see me say it was my favorite ui and I used to have the crow crest as my discord pfp, definitely would love to see it back in the game.
---
Remember rap to move???
---
They're still in my shop, hmm
---
Yeah but does bull have a mega evolution?
---
Yeah I got the same ad. Completely bullshit
---
Disagree with shelly
---
I remember when i was kid i would spend hours on fake websites giving away free gems for Clash of Clans. Smh
---
I spent the last 3 hours making this! I thought it would be funny. When I was done, I‚Äôm like what the fuq did I just make.
---
If they have pressed the ‚Äúremember this device‚Äô button wich they have, they won‚Äôt need anymore for the security code
---
Holy crap that's crazy. But also kinda cool. Like you could focus on getting their damage up first or getting health maxxed before the other stats? Kinda cool, it would allow for, say 5,000 health El Primo vs. 8,000 health El Primo, but the 5,000 EP might have way more strength... Kinda cool I dunno.
---
Pretty sure they won‚Äôt know you unfrienddd them
---
Thx XD !
---
But How do you use it?
---
True, or someone getting Leon 
---
all of them cuz theyre limited time
---
Aw fuck. I need 7 more gems and 700 more trophies to get santa mike
---
Thx &lt;3
---
theyre literally not stealing cuz it says the creator
---
I really wish they make a Soldier Brawler
---
He was my first too, and unique atm ;D... He is very fun to play... I not say that he is a bad brawler, not even the worst of the legendary... Ok, he have low hp and low dmg, but if you play with he in SD, with 3 power-ups, it will change... He have a way to track enemies, just poison them, and have a great scape, if you have ultimate ready... Just traine with he.
---
super lucky I need leon :/
---
O get 3k and then let me get the karma kthx
---
Shelly is rlly good. Wat u mean
---
Cool might try it
---
stuptespon
---
Next thing you know they show how to get Leon for ‚Äúfree‚Äù
---
pulled it three times, i have no legendary to this day
---
Sorry :/
---
It helps a lot, I can even just barely beat Leon with it
---
I got crow in March. You will get one eventually don‚Äôt worry. 
---
Not at all
---
Dude what are you talking about..?????
---
so annoying rushing campers, getting knocked out, and realizing you finished 9th a minute in.
---
&amp;#x200B;

the addition of the big robot spawning and the mortars are great
---
Lol it‚Äôs midnight where I‚Äôm at too. I just can‚Äôt go to sleep because I stayed up way late last night, because New Years.
---
I hope they don't ruin spike he's op Ik but I don't want the same that happened with crow to happen with spike
---
Did you open boxes?
---
wow  supercell should see this post                                            also did you see any news in the game files? :)
---
Same!!
---
Assed on, maybe you shouldn‚Äôt try to kill shellys
---
yea no problem
---
Just reached 2k also
---
Sounds to me like that bull just out smarted you. Ive done it before. You simple move to the area they just shot so they think its clear. Just because bull has counters doesnt mean he cant counter the counters. But complex thought seems to be the last thing you have
---
*almost any brawler
---
I was thinking the same thing playingt it first
---
This guy knows what‚Äôs up
---
No, it didn‚Äôt. 
---
Fake
---
It wouldn‚Äôt let me add you for some reason. I‚Äôd love to play some duos I‚Äôm trying to rank up my spike a lot tonight. 
---
What do you mean by collab?
---
Nintendo has games that were first on mobiles
---
Ok based on the fact that the other two legendaries are the two best cards in the game right now NAW SHIT
---
Classic supercell 
---
Yeah they do but I‚Äôm pretty sure supercell is not the kind of company to collab
---
Don‚Äôt get me wrong this could potentially happen but I wouldn‚Äôt think so
---
Omg yes! I hate it when I‚Äôm piper and I try to super away but I just shoot and die. 
---
Saw this from corys video I played with this guy before and he threw like three brawl ball games he was in my team for all three
---
It won‚Äôt let me either

---
For likes or followers idk tbh
---
Exactly
---
Coming from someone who recently hit 600 with him in mostly showdown matches, Mortis has alot to do with being able to stall the game out. Although hands down his best mode is brawl ball, unless you are confident with your dribbling skills (throwing the ball and dashing to receive it again) it's better to play showdown. You have to play beyond defensive with mortis. Most of the time I'll maybe go for the 2 closest chests just to make sure they aren't nabbed by someone else, but if someone challenges the chests with you, don't be afraid to dash away. You have to be able to make the best decisions to increase mortis' chance to get to top 5 in a way that will prevent someone from killing you. 
---
Pro Tips:
---
- Don't hide in bushes that only have 1 exit (sure way to get you cornered)
---
-If there is an open chest, it's always good to go for it to prevent someone else from taking it, but don't try to go on offense if someone tries to take it.
---
- IF YOU CAN, ATTACK THE THROWERS!! Don't be afraid to go after Both Dynamike and Barley.. Be cautious of your health, but most of the time, mortis' ability to dash through means he stands a good chance of avoiding most if not ALL of those shots. (Don't attack everyone, go for those who are alone and possibly weakened)
---
TL:DR - Hide. Aim for Lobbers.
---

I tried to do it a few years ago in clash of clans but my dad got me to stop
---
Shotgunners are easy targets for long range brawlers, enjoy!
---
I slightly agree but it would get to be much of a stretch and hard to use in quick situations 
---
You won't get a high quality post unless you make some low quality ones, just like an antifragile system. If you can define a really low quality post in an objective that's fine. But if your basis is a subjective, that's censorship for me. Whether you dislike it or not that's what I think
---
Yes I did. And if you were wondering what I meant by my leg chance was bugged, it never increased for four months. I got spike which is my 2/2 legendary to unlock in august and my leg chance dropped to 0.0288%. Only had tara left to unlock at that time. Pretty sure I played daily if not close to daily and also open boxes regularly and all this time my leg chance was still 0.0288% until I got Tara a week before global release which my leg chance finally started increasing again after I got tara. Now it‚Äôs almost been a month since I got tara and my chance now is 0.0624%. I guess I could‚Äôve got my chance to 0.2XXX% if it wasn‚Äôt bugged this whole time :/
---
Haha 
---
I noticed that I paired up against complete NOOBS after I lost 3 games in a row. I think the algorithms pair you up with 0 trophy people when you‚Äôre on a losing streak. So it‚Äôs likely all those opponents you played against had just lost 3 games in a row. 
---
How to find the info 
---
Did you even read the post?
---
Who got on the new balances ü§®ü§®
---
I'd say more indian.
---
Lol exactly; every brawler good if you ‚Äúplay him right‚Äù and crush noobs. Darryl is just the worst and therefore the most difficult to play right.
---
I once had 3 bulls on the same team (2 of my teammates are bull too)
---
Thanks! I honestly didn‚Äôt know that.
---
??? Why do I keep seeing references of brawl stars in early 2018
---
Fair enough. They are easily killable though with long range characters if you play it right, but when the gas closes in... not so much.
---
Where's ricochet?
---
fr? that‚Äôs the first time I saw that happen, confused the shit outta me lmao
---
Nope, don't buy them. If you want to spend gems, use then in 60 tickets (only if you get 32 at RR), or token doubler
---
Barley any skins FTFY
---
It's basically the same as bounty
---
5 minutes can confirm. I love stunning a whole team forever. 
---
People would find an exploit and just kill each other in duos to get extra kills. If it was only showdown, maybe. But even then people like mortis can't always afford to attack people because of his natural characteristics
---
Nobody can't change your mind if you are right
---
What I want is a cancel corner. For example, if you're aiming with your super and you don't want to fiddle it around, throw your thumb into the right corner of the screen and it cancels automatically
---
Can't see anyone accidentally flicking their fingers there either
---
i see that yaranaika
---
I've won Solo Showdown with Barrell Man more times than I've won with any other cards...you just have to know how to play him
---
No. I guess you are a new player.
---
Shelly has one single role: killing tanks. So, you say she is OP because she is a tank killer that kills tanks. At higher trophies, with actual competitive players, she is B tier, so no.
---
Also, I saw a comment saying they need to nerf Bull and El Primo. No, they don't need a nerf. Both are A tier
---
DELETE THIS
---
no
---
Are you an idiot
---
I dont see /s it is mandatory
---
Not really, I haven't spent a single penny on this game and I have every single brawler.
---
so who won?
---
Yeah ok, you got me, I‚Äôm new. I probably shouldn‚Äôt be going around saying nerf this and buff that. I‚Äôll see if I can handle situations a bit smarter form now on then :)
---
Global is out, we‚Äôre waiting for replays!
---
I miss the old days of the game. 2 days ago was the first time I saw myself on a top 200 leaderboard since launch day
---
If you think this sub is trash, you haven't been to r/PUBGmobile yet.
---
March???
---
That is correct good sir
---
Either direction or opacity. Both is OP
---
Wtf. How long has the game been out???
---
The game legit released like 3 weeks ago in my region
---
And where are the snake tactic?
---
Nope but I got Leon the next day! (Today)
---
XD
---
how many trophies do you have? if you're one of those below 1k players i'll be much salt
---
How do? 
---
I don‚Äôt have dynamike or really understand his S Power.
---
The thing, he can't be used well in heist, mortis isn't weak, but he's just not viable in all modes, so he may need a rework. 
---
nice self made watermark.
---
LETS GET THIS TO 5K
---
Thanks for the kind words. Just trying to be a normal sane person while there is a lot of toxicity nowadays.
---
How?
---
He gave credits to all. 
---
Took so long... waiting in the bushes üòÇ 
---
(I am joking , congratulation)
---
That middle spot could finally make Darrel good /s

Awk brawlers aren‚Äôt supposed to be viable in every mode, otherwise they would be op

Lol you genuinely think a game as big as this that there aren't websites that'll sell you wins?
---
If you're even questioning that there aren't any organised teaming going on, you must be pretty shit at this game or strictly just play 3v3s.
---
Showdown hide in the bushes like everyone else.
---
üòÇbruh someone gets it
---
ahhhh now make sense!! i thought the health! thank you bro!
---
Not funny at all
---
No prob
---
Yup. Clash Royale was pretty good at the start too. There are 80 cards now , one of the major reason of demise. So many cards? Really? Either they are shit at release or OP.
---
In BS however , I think releasing a lot of brawlers isn't a problem. And although yeah , they are taking the "Release OP brawlers" strategy , and that's shit
---
Although it's pretty easy to be competitive in BS. As meta decks aren't strong in CR anymore. P2w players with shit decks can still beat meta decks. But in BS , teams play a very major role , plus it takes skill. And if you get a bralwer to lv 7-8 , you can go to 500 pretty easily
---
Yeah because mm based on brawler trophies only is clearly working. Can't wait to play with autoaiming Colts at 400+ cups next time I boot the game! 
---
Morti is to die in france or someting.
---
Nita means bear in the native american choctaw language
---
r/woooosh
---
Cuz it‚Äôs not really that funny.
---
So true
---
You don't know how to play him
---
Neither I do. Everyday I log in when the shop updates hoping a legendary offer will pop up, but it never happens. PLEASE SUPERCELL, LET ME GIVE YOU MY MONEY.
---
Lucky box!
---
You‚Äôre right. But I still believe an icon ‚Äò my favorite brawler‚Äô would be better. It can show your character somehow. Like the people who prefer Bull, they are more determined and aggressive or those who prefer dynamike, they tend to be more tricky. Something like this. 
---
yeah i guess that would be nice
---
There is always a chance. But it is smaller.
---
But anyway good idea.
---
Draft mode for game modes, would be fun to counter pick players
---
thanks
---
Yeah I got a comment on the video saying that I talk too much üòÖ I‚Äôm planning on having some scenes in every video where I‚Äôm not talking with an intense track playing. 
---
And actually a month ago I spent around 5 hours gathering different sound effects that I can use, and I was actually planning on implementing some soon! Thanks a bunch for the feedback
---
The only time that I can't move or there's a huge delay with shots is when I'm using a bad connection. The server issue for me is just huge loading times and a shot delay( I always can walk fine)
---
I swear I always see u before I try to do u/coachflapjack
---
Good addition! Looks amazing!
---
Thanks. I left out some info last time
---
No you can better buy 2 token doublers (2000 doublers) for 100 gems. It equals 20 boxes and it is 9 gems cheaper. 
---
But for my feeling big boxes are giving me better rewards.
---
You can't really use same brawlers at the same team unless it's random.
---
maybe they wont, you never know xd
---
r/wooosh
---
I don't see any bugs? If ur talking about the gold one... Well umm, it's to give gold...
---
Colt
---
He credits in the comments
---
Nope that's horrible luck and the worst brawlers ^/s
---
Lol everyone teaming in showdown in higher ranks.But the point is No one wants to team up with daryyl.He just needs buff
---
Look at the calculation. 3x400 and you get 150. 1200 and you get only 140
---
Ohh I get what ur saying... But U buy gold with gems... U can't buy gems with gold
---
Mix of gg and bounty, I like it!
---
Ohh I get what ur saying... But U buy gold with gems... U can't buy gems with gold...
---
So basically u get 1200 coins for the price of 140 gems not the other way around
---
Arms
---
Oh we know....
---
No. Voice chat is trash. Just use Discord if in team, and if you're with randoms just don't go with randoms.
---
I‚Äôm the owner of the page and no i never steal
---
In my opinion I really like chatty videos, and I find edits cringe a lot of the time. What your channel name btw
---
Thanks aaron
---
That doesn‚Äôt even count
---
Who is darell
---
jesus this is alot, I usally dont read long comments like this because im to lazy but the first sentence got me wanting to read it :P 
---
I got mortis this new year 2, I mainly use him in showdown to run away and dodge.
---
and yea I agree with you, although all of there games have p2w aspects you dont need to be p2w and for bs especially its handled very well.
---
Looks a little silver in my eye 
---
Actually el primo is the Spanish word for "the cousin"
---
El rey primo is a skin of el primo and it means the "cousin king"
---
el rudo primo is a skin of el primo and it means the "rude cousin"
---
You smoking crack?

Feel free to use this idea to polish the design. But remember to give credits!

Yes but highly unlikely

not how that happens lol

Shooting was so much better, made Morris go from the best to the worst
---
Good
---
Brawl stars too late.. 
---
I like very very very very very very very very very turtles
---
It's clearly photoshopped, those legs are fake. 
---
With Clash Royale there is an inherent defect in matchmaking where a 4200 trophy guy could be a lvl 10 or lvl 12 and they get matched together.
---
Its not even the same case here.They are outright lying about thier matchmaking process.
---
Crack too much
---
OOF
---
Actually, I think Supercell did it because level 5 is the mid level, where beginning players would be driven away from practice if all the bots were high level. Even though they‚Äôd be 10 too, it‚Äôd be overwhelming for new players. I think Supercell didn‚Äôt bother much with bot customisation, because over the last year they‚Äôve had way bigger worries to stress about. But I hope in the next update, there‚Äôd be more bot customisation, kind of like smash.
---
Maybe the super can be 800 heal for her and teammates for each enemy hit with the boomerang
---
and what about boom beach?
---
You're probably right. Thanks!
---
This gonna get deleted lmao
---
Really cool, but could u do a version that includes the 2017 in it?
---
Sorry it‚Äôs like hiding I can‚Äôt see
---
That shadow was a nice touch
---
stay salty kiddo imma stay with these three new brawlers ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Atacking tanks with Darryl is like not using the walls with throwers
---
Right with you there
---
Thanks 
---
also in the movie coco I think there are Mexican skeletons which like to play music so they probable changed the c in coco to a p to make poco
---
RIP, did they attack back?
---
I mean giving us the option to move it would be nice also
---
Wait that‚Äôs from kairos or lex...
---
Do you know how to check your statistics?
---
Woo
---
I thinks they are the same thing because Magikarp can evolve to Gyarados and Darryl have his Star Power
---
You‚Äôre actually full of shit congrats üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
That‚Äôs not a woosh
---
Yep.
---
Freak off
---
I prefer FLITHY FRANK
---
Chungus needs to be in brawl stars
---
Make the attacking sound very loud, I want to see how people will react to it
---
That‚Äôs what I thought, and I made it on my account
---
I only see an empty selection screen
---
Ohh thanks
---
Very good watermark indeed
---
Oh hi you
---
Thanks! 
---
Maybe make Leons and Darryls supers reload speed very slow for the event, ro make them less viable.
---
Good idea! You should make a post about it!
---
I didn‚Äôt specify who‚Äôs shoes are those
---
Meanwhile EA is buried in the core of the earth
---
+++++) 
---
That all characters apart from Crow and Colt move at the same speed?
---
I don't agree
---
Hahaha nice oneüòÇ
---
But at least I‚Äôm in the middle... xD
---
U mean leon and spike
---
Again with you? If your having trouble in your personal life and that‚Äôs why your acting out like this, then figure that out before you spread your toxicity here. Otherwise keep your demeaning thoughts to your self. 
---
Thank god I downloaded the game on global release üòÇüòÇüî•ü§ôüèº
---
No 
---
Ive seen worse :/
---
That‚Äôs how I felt when I got Leon on my second day of playing. I was like ‚Äú hey this lil dude looks neat‚Äù
---
Can anyone be your friend? Any requirements? (Trophies, active, etc)
---
Sry me footnote fan boy

I heard it on plant vs zombies 2...

Spawn trap
---
This isn't what we need in 2019!
---
I actually tried to rotate the photo 
---
Ye
---
I would DEFINITELY play more friendly matches if this features were added.
---
Good work man! And great idea!
---
You do know that the player that got all her brawlers to 500 at lv one had to be carried by pros. Yes she was good herself, but she never would have done it without god tier teammates.
---
Post was deleted
---
Thats why it would be an optional idea. Recentering your super rn is difficult and still leads to misfires anyways, with his idea i don't see how you can accidentally cancel your super by dragging it from the bottom all the way to the top right of your screen "accidentally". 
---
I seem to get like 2 or 3 tickets every day.
---
when you reach rank 15 with El Primo, you need to spice shit up. nothing is more exciting that jumping into 3 foes with 15 gems and 10% hp.
---
Im facing mostly bull or colt same as you üòÖ
---
Well for the people have thousands of coins left over I think it's a great way to spend them
---
You wasted time
---
Yeah, I knew that it meant to die or something in some languages, but I didn't wan't to make a statement since i wasn't 100% sure which language. Esperando was the only one I found (I probably could have gotten better results if I had time to search)
---
Yeah.. i was thinking the same. I think i,ll wait then
---
Removed - DO NOT SUBMIT POSTS WITH TITLES IN ALL CAPS. CAPS LOCK IS CRUISE CONTROL FOR COOL
---
Lol how can you say that?
---
So I guy just starts playing the game and only plays Shelly, gets her to 300 trophies because he only plays her...
---
You would rather play with him, than someone who has 8k trophies but only has 200 trophies on Shelly? 
---
üòâ
---
Is spike not good? Got him a few days into playing and I realize he's super rare, but haven't tried him out yet because he doesn't look appealing
---
shelly time
---
The brick had no chance lol
---
Yes buy santa mike...the santa theme fits well on him...he has even a bag on his bag with toys and his basics and super are changed
---
*brawler legendario*
---
Unless she...
---
...is banned from this gamemode...
---
...or her reload speed would be super slow...
---
Was only giving my opinion, not really a doubler if it gives you a fixed amount ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è guess people didn't like the idea of getting more tokens? Oh well I really don't care.
---
The difference is in quantity: the ‚Äúold‚Äù variety of cards needed a certain kind of grind that is not acceptable while cards are more and more, so there are basically more ways to get cards because there are more cards in general, so the ratio has not really changed.
---
Oof
---
Better make import own images. Because standart is useless.(like my mates in gemgrab. üòÜ)
---
Well if he got to 300 trophies with a level 1 shelly that means he‚Äôs a decent player, and also he will drop back down where he belongs to if he doesn‚Äôt hold up with the others.. this is how matchmaking is in every game... in LoL for example if you‚Äôre somehow diamond 5 and have been playing less than a year it doesn‚Äôt make you worse than a guy who has been playing for 5 years and is also diamond 5
---
I‚Äôm sorry but in 500+ trophies showdown is not very viable to gain trophies. What you‚Äôre describing is known as win trading, where since the MM pool is so small, is easy to do. If they all ready up at the same time, they are likely to be placed in the same game and BOOM win trade. It is violating supercell‚Äôs User agreement and should be reported.
---
No not really, Brawl Stars has been so little time in global; so it hasn‚Äôt reached the popularity of the other games; maybe in the future...
---
i thought the same but a robot spawned and brock used his super......... lel
---
Awesome!
---
Bear in mind you don't have much hp- don't rush in.
---
My brawler trophies are high but I still match up with these dipshits some how :/
---
 Map that I created using [https://mordeus.itch.io/](https://mordeus.itch.io/)
---
Play it at using this map key P2lkPTY5RUY2N0U4RjBEN0I1NDImbWFwPVRVRlFYemM9
---
Comments to improve the map is greatly appreciated
---
You cannot shoot while being pulled, or while being spat out(for lack of a better term.) you can indeed fire back in the little interval where the black hole collapses and hasn‚Äôt exploded yet. 
---
Supercell....   MAKE THIS HAPPEN
---
Original players 
---
Whaaaa. Brock won?
---
Damn, how the tables have turned.
---
Thank you, u/BadziejNadziej and u/Axel1702 for some of the tips!
---
Best VALUE is to buy tickets/token doublers. If you're constantly getting 31/32 in Robo Rumble tickets is the best value. If not go for token doublers. However, if you just want Leon and don't care about value just wait for the offer to come into your shop. I would go for tickets because you still have a chance to get Leon, can get gems from the boxes and also can get power points for the rest of your brawlers.
---
You can check the bushes when u get close to them
---
That's awesome!!
---
Yep agreed
---
No, it most likely means he got carried by better team mates or a better Duo partner.
---
Should be like Clash of Clans, trophy tiers so you play with and against people of the same overall trophies as yourself.
---
So you would pick to play with the new guy over the experiences guy?
---
Wtf do you mean? It's a super Mario reference
---
Wow you‚Äôre one lucky homo if you have so many brawlers under 2k trophies
---
You‚Äôre stupid if you think BrAWl StaRs is ever gonna so better than fortnite 
---
Once, and only once, I tried opening a box with Poco...
---
some say I'm still trying to.
---
Wait... whaaattt?
---
Yeah, that's why people like me spend 20$ on phoenix crow :)))
---
Tease to a new skin? Or maybe Penny‚Äôs original skin concept 
---
Thanks!
---
Would be good to have speed emotes to say something 
---
true 
---
The post was stolen 
---
You beat me to it
---
sorry, i was to agresive. XD
---
You can still improve by watching videos of higher gameplay and tipps or at least you have fun with the game
---
I'm sure they have the "technology" because you can spectate live battles. And in clash of clans and clash royale, they've got the replay function. 
---
My hypothesis is that there's probably some technical issue preventing them from enabling the feature without disturbing the game due to game mechanics or code. But there could be another reason that I cannot think of. 
---
I just saw a post that Bull is saying "Pam let me see the kids"........ This is messed up.
---
RNG is RNG.  The only way to guarantee getting a brawler is the purchase them when they become available.  
---
Maximizing gems and buying boxes doesn't mean anything.  I watched a video of a guy that bought 200 dollars worth of mega boxes and got nothing, not even a Super Rare for which he still needed 2 of them.
---
So buy the brawler specials and/or pray.  That's about it.
---
Screw the rico piper relationship it‚Äôs all about the leon nita getting together
---
So is colt, I think
---
Ok thanks for the tips
---
I don‚Äôt think the devs themself have thought about this either when making limited time skins. Christmas sounds so far away right now so I guess we just have to wait for now
---
Im the bull. They will be scared of me holding 10gems and running away. Wooops its not showdown. But anyways! Go rush in!
---
Or they wait for a special event like their birthday and then do an opening
---
Yea its too much nowadays
---
Hehe what :P
---
I was a 4600 f2p with no maxed or even semi maxed cards. I've played CR for almost 2 years constant .And no , both are pretty good right now. Clash Royale looks like it takes more skill
---
BS also has a deeper learning curve that many people don't know about?
---
Are you one of the best mortis? Can you use Dyna star power to its advantage? All of your brawlers at 600?
---
Ofc its worth
---
Holy shit thanks a lot man. Gained 300 trophies yesterday w Darryl.
---
Me too but apparently thats false
---
when you have bad aiming, and you know your opponent have no super and/or had wasted his shots. Easy kill. :-)
---
Whats the point of the vid? Its not funny nor anything
---
Yea
---
Lets change him into the Franky Tank thingy when he uses the super xD
---
Hes op
---
True haha 
---
*complains about teamers while he‚Äôs bush camping for 4th place*
---
Enlarged sorched stone tbh
---
Its not gambling cause it takes an specific amount of time to the gems to pop up
---
I'm glad somebody noticed it
---
Bull and piper could be a couple // P could be Jessie‚Äôs mom and penny could be some adopted kid
---
   
---
See my profile. I have already invested 3 posts about new characters, more precisely about prototypes 
---
With Jessie and Pam, it's a much safer assumption considering that they both have the same trait of being junkers and having buildings as their supers. With Colt, there's nothing going for him in terms of being the son of Pam. No need to get you jimmies rustled
---
I honestly don‚Äôt think so I have both mythical and Tara is pretty good in certain scenarios but Morris is decent in brawl ball but that is about it and it is random so save ur money for a legendary not in the future because the worst one in my opinion is crow but he is still really good
---
Honestly i feel like clash royale has gotten way better in that regard.
---
I like how there is different symbols that really enhance the new statistics! 
---
The BO urgently needs a remodeling 
---
Nice, but I don't have his star power :(. 
---
Give me Lunch Lady Pam instead.
---
I mean, there is no game mode where every brawler is useful, like no one chooses Poco in Heist. This mode isn't supposed to be balanced, it could be a game mode where you don't lose trophies, or a friendly battle event! 
---
Also, if one brawler is too op, just make their super rellad slower!
---
 Don't get what's wow about this honestly, those three are obviously queued as a team, and once you get above 400 trophies the lack of players means you're more likely to get a larger discrepancy in the trophy numbers. 400 vs 600 doesn't seem that big to me. 
---
"iS tHaT a OG SkIn?"
---
It's a mobile game. Do you really need to flex that you played the game before anyone else? Must not have much in RL to flex that you are a "beta" player.
---
I play with poco
---
And her plays with jessie
---
(Sometimes a friend play with us using nita)
---
Her ultimate/super should make it that everyone on the map misses their shots since her name is bloom
---
Thank you! :D If you want more tips, check out my newest version!
---
I guess so. I mean, why is he still considered a Heavyweight/Tank after the rework. He almost has the same health as Mortis, and he can be compared to Shelly. And his Double Shotguns may seem to be inconsistent, but I'm always seeing Darryls in Showdown absolutely dominating, which is why I want him. 
---
With these tips? 
---
Im glad that you like it! :D
---
But he shoots sharps
---
Thats a really good tip! Im gonna add it to the 2.0 version! Thanks!
---
Thanks for the feedback guys üí™üèº
---
how i can see the game files?
---
Well then again PUBG is a game you have to pay for, and it‚Äôs the same thing over and over. No new maps, honestly no updates, and the bugs are absolutely game breaking. When I installed PUBG I won my first game and the second I flew under the map and died
---
Does telling you to go to sleep count as being toxic =\
---
I never saw any of your other psots about other supercell games. Hmmmmmmm, new reddit account or what?
---
I would rank Rico higher.
---
Great list man!
---
no more ugly skins for frank plz
---
How not?  The controls would be infinitely better.  Your 2 sticks are actual, locked joysticks, and you can map any 2 buttons you want to attack/super.
---
People said the same thing about Clash of Clans dying yet it is still one of the more popular SC games. Trust me you don't know what dying means.
---
Nice video, love the different calls you made on strategy by showing some of the less experienced players on this sub when it‚Äôs okay to retreat. Even when Bull had an opportunity to cap the game you stayed patient in the corner. People can spam bull all they want, I‚Äôd rather take it as an opportunity to learn counters or other strats like teaming to flush out the less skillful into using other brawlers eventually. 
---
Holy shit I didn‚Äôt realize that
---
To make it clear, what he said wasn't 100% correct, supercell didn't encourage teaming, they allowed teaming as there may be a chance of betrayal, but they don't like it to be so serious that teaming become the only option to survive, that's y they came with modded events to reduce teaming. 
---
Dyna-Mike: ‚ÄòHold my beer...‚Äô
---
I would make it so they can throw 3 boomerangs, each 1 shot but your ammo doesn't refill until you get it back but boomerangs damage everytime they hit anything 
---
So have it time itself so if you stood still then your ammo would reload as normal,  if you moved towards the 'rang you could reload sooner and if you moved away it would take longer to reload
---
The Super would be a bunch of mini boomerangs that form a continuous shape of flower petals around the player
---
And Star would allow you have a low % chance to steal a gem or ball from the enemy but they can get it back
---
I picture this version having giant medium range boomerangs that can cross barriers because I think ultimately this would end up being a high skill cap type play where you take advantage of having a boomerang follow you around if you're move rate is faster than your boomerang's 
---
Not to crap all over your version but that's what I thought when I saw the name
---
Nude spike 
---
To be fair, with such a big team, hiding in a bush is his only hope to not lose trophies. I don't blame him.
---
Definitely my girl Jessie but why not use all of them. They're all good
---
He's only bushcamping because there were teamers. Otherwise, I don't think op would bushcamp. 
---
Oh thanks! That first tip can be really useful! I have made an upgraded version where I listed that Colt thing! 
---
Yeah awk. U can‚Äôt be toxic and then change ur mind bc I‚Äôm a good barley
---
I know what you're coming from but at the end of the day it doesn't matter how many ways you have to get cards it doesn't change the fact that you need an insane amount of cards and gold to stay competitive in ladder( decks are prone to be screwed by balance changes)
---
Recently they nerfed the trade system, special offers are getting worse and worse and clan wars is a huge gold sink. 
---
Sure you get more cards and gold but the progression curve is bigger than ever so is not that impactful.
---
OG‚Äôs are the one that had to make a Canadian Apple ID for when you live in America
---
Step 2: play Darryl!
---
Good to see other people enjoying and understanding Darryl as much as I do.
---
I have to say, Darryl is by far the favourite brawler of mine at the moment, because I have no epic, mythic and legendary.
---
I also think that his description in-game is bad. He is more like an asassin not a heavyweight or something else... 
---
Yes, it still gives one team an unfair advantage over the other.
---
so true smh
---
Skins are technically new content. Most of the updates they do are 3months apart or so.
---
AHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAGAHAGGAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAGAHAHGAHAHAAHAHAHAHHAHAGAGAHAHAH
---
Shouldn‚Äôt clash royale be face down on the floor doing snow angels, probably in their money
---
its still the most pathetic way to get trophies and there should be no excuse for it
---
My whole life has been a lie
---
Yea, best advice I can give is to join an active club around your trophy level 
---
Feel free to respond 
---
I‚Äôm listening but I can‚Äôt hear anything please help.
---
I don‚Äôt understand 
---
Omg... luckey you....

He‚Äôs not just don‚Äôt walk into him

Contact support they will be able to help you get the purchase you lost
---
Oh I get it 
---
Christ man chill 
---
Wonderful observation detective Nexolas!
---
The irony
---
dont start wondering why you got like 7 upvotes when ppl can't understand what you're saying
---
Bought a few gems (enough for a few mega boxes and the level special deals) but I recently opened up spike as well! Currently at 1300. 
---
this is not a meme its just a factual statement at this point
---
Then tell me why people after me have lower digits than me?

thats dirty...

i\`ll try it right away

You could have done the title a lot of different ways, and you chose the one that makes it look like this is your idea, instead of something like "damanined new skin" or something. Shame. 
---
Mhmmm
---
Really? I think your max is 300 throphies now so ...
---
My max is with Leon, and I‚Äôm at 432

How many throphies you have on your account,

Whaaaatt, lol you know needs play this game.

Holly sh\*t, every body RUN!!!

There‚Äôs a possibility that the rewards were added to your account, you just didn‚Äôt get to open the box to get them. Maybe check to see if anything looks different? Token doubler counts, power points, etc.

Yesüò™

üòêüòê

You will be surprise... trust me.

Thanks I‚Äôll check

Well I wouldn't say massively... But I also wouldn't call myself the best player so yeah you are part right

Sneaky Banditos

So mortis?

That particular bull was a bad player. Any sensible player would keep the pressure up when you were in the gas.
---
1 word that kills me all the time: THROWERS
---
Ok,i understand. You need to play bs more than 1 month to understand me. I play brawl stars like 6 months and have 6000 throphies.(Without legendaries lmao)
---
I did not write anywhere that this is a skin idea. Only an idiot would think so. It is clearly written that there is a new skin

Or the power-ups u can pick up in showdown. I want to make some thumbnails and pictures and such. And i do need ‚Äúclean‚Äù versions of these things. I can‚Äôt find them via google oder so.. :/
---
Spike is a glass cannon, can do lots of damage in short amount of time and can be taken out just as quickly 
---
You are rare specimen my friend.
---
no its true. check the percentages on your box rates, open a bunch, and then check it again. it gets barely higher
---
Why do you say that?
---
It should be me vs getting Leon. Gud meme btw
---
Bull reminders me of Buck in Paladins. A massive giant boulder with a shotgun that comes straight at you, you hit him with everything you can, but he 1/2 shots you and gets away with full/almost full heal. The only difference is that Bull‚Äôs shotgun is a double barrel one.

That's awesome lol

At a very low level, it‚Äôs pretty much useless. Don‚Äôt judge Mortis by how I use him. I‚Äôm a disgrace to Mortis users and I should never be looked up by a beginner. I‚Äôm warning you, this is horrible news that you‚Äôre judging Mortis by how I play him
---
Yeah she does lmao

The last one? Its "Legend" i didn't put the text cause it doesn't fit

I seriously doubt you run into lvl 10 bulls every match
---
wow idiot wants to get banned
---
Why do you doubt that.
---
i can hear the music right now
---
Well i lost maybe like 3 games while playing him so you can re-think isnt you the reason why you lose :)
---
Maybe work on the star power. But overall cool idea
---
I asked this in help and support and they will investigate that. I think they just forgot it when ricochet came out.

repost with their faces in it and it‚Äôll get to the front page
---
They either bought gems/the brawlers or just got lucky. 
---
I'm a Level 37 at 2100 trophies and I only have Dynamike and the trophy brawlers under him, all the rares, Penny, and Mortis (So 12 brawlers). I wanted Darryl/Ricochet as my next brawler, but I got Mortis. It's just pure luck honestly. What I'm doing now is saving gems for Token Doublers, and Tickets as the ticket events give so much tokens.
---
Wow! Also... I was sad to see the WiFi symbol :(
---
How many trophies do you have? If you are a global player, you dont deserve him already.
---
I‚Äôve spent 0 and I have all brawlers and am at 11k trophies
---
5usd

Actually, Ricochet's bullets CAN damage twice. There is a small time delay before *any* brawler's bullets can hit the same brawler multiple times. *Each individual bullet* has a one second delay before it can hit the same  brawler again. EXAMPLES: Ricochet's super, Colt's super, Tara's attack, Barley's attack and super, Shelley's super, etc. Certain attacks can only hit a brawler once TOTAL, for example Nita's attack and Frank's attack and super.

I really don't have a problem with this map despite the asymmetry. Throwers on both teams have plenty of cover and chances are good close range will destroy the shit out of the barriers regardless.
---
Still should be fixed for symmetry's sake. I can't stand seeing maps that are asymmetrical. I could almost cry. 
---
Any more info?
---
Oh okay gotcha
---
Umm chill man 
---
My support contact person said they will investigate it and they will seriously look at it. Probably they will fix it in a next update he wrote me. 
---
Yep
---
Oh alright
---
El Primo glitch v2
---
It‚Äôs not or maybe they forgot it. I wrote it in help and support and they will seriously take a look at it and probably fix it in a next update
---
Bull is pushing with 8. Shelly is pulling back with 1. Both are wrong, if you're neither, you're probably doing something else wrong. 
---
You should add your watermark
---
Mehh...it falls in the same style as many already in existence.
---
Looks pretty cool, just a bit random.
---
uhm.... he is one
---
I'm Brazilian and I use Google Translate, so it's hard to understand, but from what I understand you draw? if you come in, call me to talk so we can partner and send our ideas to the supercell, it will be awesome. 
---
Zero Two.
---
Someone called?
---
Just had a quick listen and already enjoying it! What you should do is try and reach out to some mods or YouTubers on twitter or reddit and show them it. In sure they would love it as well and promote it. From what I heard it was well structured and did not bore me( and I know how hard it is to make an entertaining podcast or anything for that matter) keep it up and ill also try and help out if you want, I would love to help:)
---
Which lags? With game or with "bad internet connection"
---
This one is damn good...awesome
---
Listen to this episode of my podcast, Boston Brawlers - A Brawl Stars Podcast , Boston Brawlers Podcast - Shelly Breakdown and Nita! Brawl stars https://anchor.fm/money1834/episodes/Boston-Brawlers-Podcast---Shelly-Breakdown--Brawl-stars-e2s8cr
---
Theres nothing wrong. People are stupid of they think thats real
---
?
---
Nah he didn't buy gems he just got very lucky he got Frank,Tara,All the Super-Rares and Rares. I only have 1 super-rare and all the rares thats it.
---
Lets just hope we get more brawlers soon because they help a lot for trophies.
---
That's great advice and I appreciate it, anything you can do to help I'd be very grateful and I for sure will reach out to some youtubers and try getting them to help me promote aswell.
---
What?
---
That‚Äôd be cool!
---
Haha xD
---
Damn Right We‚Äôll Over Power Them 
---
They probably expect to verse people with the exact same trophy count
---
Well that could be true... but it‚Äôs weird anyway
---
Sorry, but I have come to intervene! &gt;:P
---
But the channel grew up because of the characters intro video and there was nothing wrong but now they are stealing the videos from the official youtube channel.. 
---
frank would be op 
---
do you
---
Well when you say that, it should be taken down. No downvotes please.

---
Uh, I‚Äôm sorry üòÇüòÇ
---
And on my cake day...
---
A lot of my friends that play fortnite are starting to play brawl stars too 
---
You can see it! It doesn‚Äôt hit twice! Also if u calculate it:
---
Rico shoots 12 bullets and each one does 392 damage. Frank has 8120 health-12*392=3416
---
But that‚Äôs not a noob that‚Äôs called a smart player
---
I'm at 6k and I don't think he needs a nerf, but he is really easy to use 
---
Alright I've already sent a few messages to mods and stuff. Maybe you could drop your brawl name or send an invite make it easier to talk? If not dont worry
---
Midnight in the international time zone change I'm assuming? Because I had one hours before midnight where I live
---
Competitive mode or casual 
---
Look at it this way. His normal shots are pretty balanced as they are currently but if you allowed his shots to deal damage more than once, that would make him broken on maps that have tight corridors. I‚Äôm around 11k trophies and I think I have a pretty good understanding of how the brawlers are and the state the game is in.
---
If you want to report a bug, go into gem grab and die with a gem in the back of your map hiding inside a tree in the corner. The tree will cover your character but the gem will appear in front of the tree.
---
The trophy system is actually explained in a new kiaros time video pretty well
---
It‚Äôs not a bug 
---
Those free supers...
---
I think you misunderstood something. 
---
You

Many people have used it / reposted it various times. It's disappointing the original creator is never giving proper credit. 
---
Sometimes.
---
I bet I can edit out all of ur watermarks
---
Actually, spending gold on power points speeds up your progression to having max power points, but you‚Äôll have less gold then. However, you will get more gold from boxes later. It is a trade off, but it‚Äôs not bad.

Omae wa mou shinderu

He would be significantly better than every brawler in puddle splash üëÄ
---
to the rescue! EEEEEEEEELLLL PRIMO
---
Bull was the 2nd to last person alive?
---
Weird flex but ok
---
How did u download this? Can I do it on my computer?
---
If they get you at max range the dynamite explodes pretty quickly as soon as it lands. Also smart dynas save up till they have 3 shots then fire rapidly which makes it easier to land devastating hits.
---
Ye they are
---
It's not that big of a deal but there's definitely situations that having that could decide games and there's definitely people that that factor made them win or lose
---
I managed to escape üòÅ
---
Is this a joke
---
r/woosh
---
Other than the Brock play and arguably another one after that, he played very well. WTH you talking about 
---
I‚Äôll said it once and I‚Äôll keep saying it, Darry either needs an accuracy buff or an HP buff. I would prefer an accuracy buff only because you have to practically stand right next to Brawlers in order for all the pellets to hit which leaves them with just enough HP to finish you off.
---
and yes I was a darryl too, hence 0-0
---
What are best showdown maps for him?
---
Always nice to get it lol

Hapoy cake day

No matter what there is an area that is impossible to throw which doesn't make sense to me
---
Hey, can you help me, I'm deaf so I can't see this post, can you tell it to me in sign language so I can see it?
---
It also allows the bullets to pierce.
---
ü§≠ Forgot about that. Thanks!
---
Barley is really good in heist too
---
If a Frank isn't stupid enough he won't let bull get close enough.
---
I never said Frank will kill in 3 hits. But he out ranges bull and can kite him. The wind up may be large but so is the cone.
---
Hey
---
But this was posted today
