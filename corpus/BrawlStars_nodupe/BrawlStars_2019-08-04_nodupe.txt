That is all the brawlers that are going to get a remodel

never add 1 gap holes brawlers cant fit through them

My reaction when i got leon

You mean cancel

Thank you

That‚Äôs nothing

SUPERCELL NEEDS TO PUT THIS ON CHRISTMAS UPDATE
---
No prob
---
are the bosses robots/AI because setting a bosses hp to 30000 would make tanky brawlers worthless because their hp wouldnt scale

Pipper burlesque, for example

It's a name. This is mit really contend. Many brawler have still different names in the code. What do mean with "space theme". I know brawl Stars origins but what do you mean?

There neve been traces of those in the game for like 2 years

I would have an opening in the middle of each parallel wall so you can funnel play into the rest of the map.

WE NEED THIS MAN HIRED FOR SUPERCELL

I will do more maps if i can

The percentage wouldnt add up to 100% due to the loss of health overtime

how toxic

You would get about that much from a mega box anyways

This event is way more fun than rumble true. But on an average you get 18 tokens, let's say. Then there's a difference of 12 tokens per ticket (assuming you're good enough to score 30 in rumble which is fairly easy) then that's a total difference of 480 tickets with doublers, or 240 without it. Pretty significant imo.

Or the Mortis that dashes towards a Dynamike while invincible and there ain't shit you can do about it.

Very exciting

As it happened with rosa today

Why y'all just not upgrade?

Just make pam like Mei from overwatch

---
Who won it?
---
Well, i see too much skulls, but, its fine for long distance brawlers, but i think you should try putting more spikes or walls, so short range brawlers can have a chance

Just a horrible job on balancing piper and shelly (they are annoying af)

Lol
---
Dragonball Episodes? Where are they

Same but I stopped and I‚Äôm piased about the new update with trophies
---
If it were possible to just report teasers/trolling there wouldn‚Äôt be a need for the meteors, teaming would become much less of an issue.
---
yeah now 1000 trophy players can get rank 20 brawlers

For this post I kept 626 like and my leon trophies are 626 and your gf unlocked u leon what a coincidence.

The first time I played a Supercell game was at 2014. I was on training for my first Job and my trainer and a fellow Co-worker were talking on how many trophies they had at Clash of Clans, I was there like "The heck y'all talking about?"  bad question... Baaaad! They made me download the game and I got hooked. Then I realized there were more games so I also started playing Boom Beach and later Clash Royale
---
Kept the trend going for over 2years before I stopped 'cause I wasn't enjoying the games no more. Then saw a couple of ADs for Brawl Starts and I was like "Aww Sh**! Here we go again!"  as soon as that game got released global I've been playing non-stop! Over 10K trophies and all brawlers! Can't say I didn't spend money on it... 2nd Mobile game ever that made me put money on it (First one being Pokemon GO)

That is true. I got leon from a free box (I was trying to get Rosa). I legit fainted for 15 minutes but came back to consciousness. I was sad I didn't get Rosa from 6 big boxes and 67 small boxes.

Thank you for your input! My decision to put grass instead of walls is that range brawlers are able to do their damage and alike walls, can be destroyed with certain supers.

OMFG KILL ME I WASTED 100 DAYS OF MY LIFE GETTING NITA AND YOU GOT HER IN A COUPLE OF HOURS WTFFFFFFF
---
Thats what i thought too. Nice
---
Freaking 1 tile gaps, brawlers hitboxes are too big to go through 1 tile gaps
---
"normie"
---
Not a  big fan of blondes...
---
Doesn't even look like Nita anymore Lmao
---
This is not true at all.  Most quality stuff gets to hot.  The only quality posts that haven‚Äôt gotten to hot recently were the frame-coloring ones.
---
My highest is 5:01 and it was with nita
---
Wait, the lanterns turns on? Wow i didn't know that, it was like supercell was planning to add a dash bar to mortis the the whole time
---
How is it better?  Doesn‚Äôt fit at all.
---
still 1 tile gaps
---
Whoa, that took a turn üòÖ
---
It would definitely be a nice add on. If they showed the damage / healing in gem grab, that would be even better!

Monsters... they want to skin leon apart!

just wait for teamers in big game!

It is not a new idea.

Oh shit! Its Beatefulllllll!!!
---
You're having trouble killing Colt and Rico with that ridiculous Star Power? A maxed Mortis is the only thing I really hate to see as any low health brawler besides Spike. Don't run straight into their shots maybe?
---
Uhh my friends and cousins used to play Clash of Clans but I was not a fan, too much of a grindy game. Then, I was searching for a nice little game, nothing too fancy and I'm not into shooting games but this caught my eye and I played it for a while, then just didn't open it and forgot about it. And after months, I opened the game again like 4 months ago and surprised by the changes and I got some new brawlers and then just played regularly cuz so much fun. 
---
Code be : 8GV00YG0G
---
No problem Man :)
---
It‚Äôs because of the new push system.. everyone will get all brawlers ez to 500.. we Pros say 700 is like 500 and Then it starts going up
---
Fun fact: Magnum Special lets you just barely hit the heist safe in Safe Zone from that nice left corner wall.
---
How i can getba brawler on my name
---
Nice matchmaking.
---
Sharpshooters vs throwers
---
Do you really think you'll be able to get nearly as many boxes from star points as the old reward system? C'mon.

r/brawlstarscompetitive
---
Dude mortis can just go thru people in bb and score
---
Oh. Basically spinning
---
With his friends but without his skin
---
This is exactly how you know band aid is op. It was the same way with Rosa when she was op. Because if you don‚Äôt gang up on Shelly, she‚Äôs very likely going to win.
---
And do you think that we won't before ithas even been released?
---
I didn‚Äôt know how much I needed this until I got this          Great work
---
Yes
---
I‚Äôm assuming in these scenarios you‚Äôre running to the left, correct?
---
creature of the night!
---
nice tier list!
---
Barley is going right but all others are going left
---
Uh what?
---
Gene wicc
---
Not if you are good enough to actually fight her and beat her instead of teaming with the whole lobby.. that doesn't even make you good just because Shelly is good in close range doesn't mean teaming up on her is fair
---
You dash through them and pass to dribble. 
---
https://youtu.be/e1Sd2og2IxE
---
I haven't mentioned mortis ONCE though?
---
Got ya. Barley is really the easiest in close range. Auto aim works pretty well with him but leading gives you the potential for more damage. Nice to see someone else has figured out tick. So many rando ticks have no clue how to lead his shots when he‚Äôs being chased.
---
Fair point
---
Sure ; )
---
I‚Äôm Neo!!
---
Ik but there really dumbs cant see it
---
Your the first to ever get him your so good
---
But isn't it the 60th frame?
---
So? I mean so?
---
Creeper
---
In the corner it says 145?
---
Same but 10k.

If I ever woke up and saw Minecraft Poco staring at me I'd probably bleach my eyes out

Robobis better
---
Yeah sure
---
Robo is better
---
I tool from last year to now toget her!
---
Poco's that use their heal to save their teammates in gem grab (thats me btw got rank 20 today)
---
Well if you are lucky enough the match will have more shellies so it'd be more fair
---
Nice and true too
---
makes a better corner, adds skeletons and replaces some walls with wooden barriers.
---
I had my Power 1 Rico at 500 get 19s but it didn't go up against all power 9 shellies.
---
Bibi needs a buff
---
Downvote him!
---
Absolutely.
---
nice
---
I was so upset when my tick team was being hunt down by a low health el primo (500hp maybe) and instead of throwing in front of himself he auto aimed (I guess) and DIED WITH LIKE 15 CUBES TO A 0 CUBE EL PRIMO AHSUDUDKDOEKD WHYYYYY
---
Nope
---
Since when did ‚ÄúCould you please stop?‚Äù become a way to express opinion?
---
That was me until I opened 20 boxes and got both piper and Frank at the same time
---
no
---
I didn't care about these posts befoee the trophy rework. Now they're hella annoying
---
Matching against people with shity attitude is the worst than low trophy player.
---
They usually give up and go super charging the enemy team when the enemy picked up 10 gem and it sucked.
---
I started in about 2017 but lost my account in 2018 but have pushed to 4k (clash royale) and brawl stars since global release and I just randomly stumbled across a supercell game and supercell is my favourite game company ever since
---
And Primo is sp twice! That's rare!
---
I don't know if this mechanic is in brawl stars but in clash Royale they change you're name to a troops name if your username is inappropriate
---
I can‚Äôt be the only confused by the lack of shitpost here.... seems suspicious
---
this is a special map which the cactus save many people‚Äôs life
---
Cause u autoaimed lol
---
why does everyone disagree with this person and then gets so many downvotes
---
The blue one is better
---
Kinda useless,only place I see it being used is when you need to outlast somone in the gas
---
Not is youre playing shelly
---
How did you make the outilne?
---
It's fine for me
---
Yeah I agree I was really hoping for something that would've raised his dps or at least this would've been more effective if it healed you after you went out of invisibility
---
I am poco weapon guy
---
Lol what about night witch mortis
---
why u post it 2 times lol nice art anyways
---
Maybe he wants to show that he doesn't like it?

Why would team when you're basically not loosing any trophies

Pffff its flaired Art. Can't you see the.... umm... art in this?

Im sorry about your father,  i hope life is as good as can be.  Maybe try an uncle or grandparent.  Literally anyone with a credit card or prepaid credit card can do it.  
---
Just click on the shop,  click on whatever you want to buy,  then put in your credit card information. 
---
If Supercell had an option to send gifts to other players,  I'd buy you a small thing of gems myself. 
---
Some things cost less than $5, but honestly, I'd suggest you do some work for someone in your family who has a credit card,  earn your $20, and buy a package deal.

Let me know how it goes friend,  i hope the best for you.

My god spike damage is just out of the world

I started playing Clash of Clans in 2014 because my friends played too, it was so much fun because we were in the same clan participating in wars! When Clash Royale was released we also played together for a LONG time! So in 2018 I was introduced to BrawlStars by a friend, from the moment I saw the game I just loved the new style of play. Since then I play BrawlStars every day with my friends, climbing trophies, playing events and friendly matches.

Lucky I‚Äôm at 8000 trophies but I ain‚Äôt got a legendary
---
I'm awaiting like 6 star powers!
---
That's crazy
---
My SP:0
---
Good idea
---
Those are the worst teamers I ever saw, they are like the average teammates in heist, and brawl gem grab
---

---
I know Im kidding but still it's unfair to get teamed on
---
Sure why not,
---
Yeah, if they have a fast move speed, it can be better to even throw a shot slightly in front of you

Barley has entered the chat
---
star point bad? i think
---
Rosa.
---
Gg
---
Oof I got crow before I got primo. I feel bad for all the people who don't have legendaries.
---
Love it good drawing ü§™
---
That‚Äôs only a few games but I understand
---
Do you mean "bug"
---
‚ÄúTEAMWORK FOR THE WIN‚Äù
---
It ain't much but it's honest work
---
This will just lead to people trying to flex on each other, and people getting triggered at each other, because the higher the brawler‚Äôs powerlevel, the more damage they are going to do
---
Very good best
---
Horrible.
---
Ik but I already had enough of Brawl stars because I played a bunch of matches
---
A life
---
Jk no offense op
---
One tile gaps, Supercell doesn‚Äôt allow maps with one tile water gaps or one tile gaps of any kind
---
Finally someone who actually
---
 Drew him
---
If matchmaking was set to pair you against similar over all trophies I wouldn't play this game.
---
Oh no he is that kind of desperate kid
---
Ok srry
---
Mine's 0.1 ;-;
---
I don't think supercell likes focusing on endgame players yet so idk if they'd do anything to implement any of that
---
Its just I rarely see someone below 6k with star power
---

---
And grammar not the right word. It is spelling.
---
Mate, you know that there's such thing as modern life. You don't know who I am and you don't know what daily life is mine, so I may not get a lot of time to think about things more thoroughly in my Reddit post. Okay
---
Barley
---
Then why are you complaining about not getting upvotes?
---
Parry this you fucking casual
---
Welcome
---
This is way too creative. It definitely doesn't belong to r/shittybrawlstars. Congrats for making probably the 1000th random tier list that makes a lot of sense (!) and is creative (!).
---
Piper looks like a man lol, good job this is great
---
This is a tracing not a drawing
---
Same
---
Spent ~50$ on  brawlstars and only used the gems for mega boxes and big boxes. 5.3k 24/27. :3
---
That happened me yesterday
---
Can you upvote mine so its at 1?

The thing is, Siege was "hard" for only a portion of the community, not because it was straight up hard (there always was a 50-50 chance of winning), but but because these players had a different playstyle, with the main difference being how long the Siege gamemode was. Players played Showdown and stuff like that, but they also wanted that Star Token, which took longer to get, since Siege took about twice the time any other game mode took. The players felt an urge to play Siege **just because of the Star Token**, which is why they didn't enjoy it and play it with a good strategy. **If you don't find playing something fun, then don't play it.**

alive
---
Ok
---
When you realize you made a typo
---
im on mobile
---
Excuse me, wtf
---
Upvoted yours
---
Yup, that's him. Thanks!
---
You can still send links
---
I got Rico with chips
---
My smellynes is undeniablw
---
Yes, I know this is a very strongly opinionated post (which is why it has so bad score), but I just wanted to give a different point of view on the game.
---
""""""thik""""""
---
I‚Äôve done it it‚Äôs at 1 now
---
See you in hot
---
Thx
---
r/excgarated
---
r/clashroyale better watch out üëÄüåö
---
It takes skill to max brawlers, less skill to get new ones, not hating, but I‚Äôm salty.
---
OMG thats so cool!
---
99/100 :/
---
I actualy like it
---
Yogurt Cream Cookie's cousin
---
Hahahahaha
---
My brother got Leon out of his first box.  :3
---
Somebody Please ban him.I amazon.com so desperate
---
But then SC would have to increase the cost of Star Points needed for this skin lol
---
How many mythics do you have
---
Really nice
---
And when you enter a match your connection dies
---
Cool
---
Only have one mythic which is Morris. Missing bibi and all other mythics and legendaries. I‚Äôm at 10.5k rn and it‚Äôs really frustrating
---
Was he president or vice president
---
yeH learned the tick one today DX
---
Vice, some promoted him
---
Same here, 8.7k with Mortis and Spike, still looking for Bibi as well
---
What's your point
---
Oh true
---
Im not good at drawing ok btw thx
---
He kicked everyone who was not vice
---
2000039 now

My player tag is # CVPR2QR 
---
I started playing Supercell games 5 years ago. That game was Clash of Clans, and since then, I have been hooked. I downloaded both Clash Royale and Brawl Stars as soon as they went global, and still play all 3 of those games now.
---
Hope I win! Thanks for doing this amazing giveaway!
---
Very nice!
---
next time make a tier list on how well a brawler can do as the big brawler i think leon is strong as the big brawler and decent against the big brawler
---
Seriously? What‚Äôs your player tag? That‚Äôs crazy
---
Woah! So what place did your team get at last?
---
The game being rigged. At some point, you have a win limit. When u reached it, it's gonna start matching you in teams where no matter how good as a player you are, you're gonna lose. You know, when the enemy team is Rosa, Penny and Barley and you're Piper, Nita and Gene on a map with mostly walls.
---
That curve ball on crow so nice
---
Your welcome
---
Pretty sure that‚Äôs not how probabilyworks
---
u/brawlstars_support
---
Why did you allow him to have vice then?
---
Someone I‚Äôm my club did
---
Biggest problems require the strongest wills.
---
Haha thx
---
Bought Spike when they put the Sakura Spike Bundle. Got Crow and Leon on free boxes (Yes! That's a thing!)
---
Well some are 100 and less, but a lot of them are resting at rank 10.
---
well, Star Powers are a whole story on their own, they are the biggest gap between casual and comp, I'm sure a bandaid nerf and a shelly super recharge nerf would make her balanced again but because of the huge gap between casual and comp she might become a Darryl 2.0, only good with her Star Power
---
Honestly this is so darn true.
---
If I was crow I would have went for spike too cause that Brock was clearly a scrub
---
For one I was talking about the brawler not your account. Second of I dont spend money either. Your still a salty female dog.
---
9500 trof√©us e ainda sem nenhum lend√°rio e sem Tara
---
I never said anything about his health, I‚Äôm just saying that his win rate statistics put him in the center of all brawlers, which means he‚Äôs balanced. If you have a higher win rate than others with tick, good job, but that doesn‚Äôt change the fact that his average win rate is still extremely balanced.
---
Nita at 820 Piper at 814
---
Yeah but she still has her long range
---
Just make a brawl stars account. If you ever decide to play Clash Royale again, download it and you won‚Äôt have to start over. Plus, you will get banned for account trading.
---
Wait... That's illegal!
---
mE tOo
---
I got crow shortly after I started playing, I have yet to understand how lucky I was
---
Crow and Leon *
---
*laughs in trophy inflation*
---
I got Leon from a free box
---
me too
---
I already have one but i want something newüòëüòë
---
Is it just me or if you notice it hard enough Rico seems to have a little bit of a Mexican accent
---
Until now it was 00:36 as I know
---
about 9,200 xD
---
Thx! #1 gonna be very difficult but im gonna try.
---
No it is BOOO
---
Thx!
---
imagine having to pay for a basic feature like spectating your own match
---
If you want I can help you. Also I can't help but notice that you have your game in Portuguese or Brazilian Portuguese.
---
Thx! I don‚Äôt play Shelly, only that one bounty map with all the bushes. But good job.
---
Haha all I need is spike now
---
"If It MaKeS yOu AnGrY jUsT sToP pLaYiNg"
---
honestly its pretty decent but stop using the app to make maps, supercell only adds maps from pixelcrux or brawlcraft
---
Trippy
---

---
Me: gets mega box and tick
---
Also me: #stonks
---
Um
---
If I was you there I would have panicked as hell wow
---
a report button wouldnt do much as theres not much to go off as why he stopped playing, you just have to deal with it, it happens in every game
---
I don‚Äôt understand the people they leave a like to ugly kindergarten children‚Äôs drawings but when there is a good drawing they ignore üòæ
---
Yes. Exactly thank you
---
you cant hack a supercell game if its a server so...
---
Thx bro
---
That damn band aid
---
3 days ago here, bought 220 power points and got him to rank 19
---
Umm... Everyone have done this
---
9999
---
Poco is Papyrus
---
Tara + Rico = Palutena Smash
---
üëçüèªüòç
---
supercell released band-aid to stop people from saying nerf shelly super--change my mind
---
I played it many times and found out that 2:08 counts as a loss and 2:07 as a Win. You can trust me
---
EDIT: after reconsideration I decided to put Leon as Strong
---
Tick is not that good because of his shots are so slow but can offer some control
---
this is definitely a problem with the servers, one thing that fixed it for me tho was using samsung game launcher (if you have a samsung phone ofc)
---
yeah sorry
---
not got a brawler since april besides tick
---
Yep, outlaw colt is too plain for a low cost. The price could be 5k star points if reasonable
---
Thats copying other people's work which is not allowed
---
If you look far back in the bottom left corner you can see Leon
---
lol
---
mortis is the best
---
Ahh yes, i love the gender _magical creature_
---
griefers are in every game, a report button wont do much as it can be easily abused and its hard to determine why that person was afk in the first place

---
Also RIP MakeAMap Mondays, I have so much stuff to recommend/spam, lmfao.
---
Good will try it
---
What app do you use I've never done this
---
The thing is: he did not even exit the game, like you do when someone calls, he wanted to make us lose
---
This was the advice I was looking for
---
thanks
---
Please check out our new subreddit r/brawlstarsnextlevel
---
I wouldn‚Äôt really know, I haven‚Äôt played that mode much... I never have any tickets
---
yeah, I know that, but its kind of hard to punish people based on not playing, I'm sure they would've added something if they knew how to get clear evidence of people not playing on purpose or trying to move but lagging, stuff like this
---
The matchmaking seems pretty good
---
EARS
---
Oh, its her second star power??
---
Right üòÇ
---
Im glad you like the idea,  please check out the new subreddit r/brawlstarsnextlevel,  join up,  we're new but getting better everyday
---
Lets bring this meme back ;)
---
A little late, but definitely deserves my upvote.
---
I HAVE EVERY BRAWLER EXCEPT THE LEGENDARIES
---
*REEEEEE*
---
no, theres an exploit where you can change star powers snd give them to other brawlers, thats bibi with mortis's "coiled snake" star power
---
00:19
---
Thx :D

brawlers can't fit through one block spaces
