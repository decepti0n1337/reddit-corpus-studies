Idk why but I kinda want a story mode. Like each brawler gets its own route. Idk, I feel like robots and the new environments would work.

hope they change it to a star skin

What about 15 players in the game and 5 teams? and maybe Squad but 20 players and 5 teams, sounds cool.

Ok, it‚Äôs not one of the repetitive shitting on you comments about you constantly reposting, but like, you used to make decent posts (not like I can say if they‚Äôre good or not) but I liked them. But now you‚Äôre just reposting and not crediting like as if that would give you free karma. Not how it works. If you want to repost, credit the original creator. Or even better, make your own content. Hope you can stop receiving all the hate you get and actually make original content. Who knows, maybe you can have tons of karma one day and be able to make great, high effort posts. I‚Äôm just saying, try making original content.

i dont think darryl really needs a buff but instead a nerf. his ability to kill is too consistent and easy in low and even high levels. steel hoops needs also needs a tiny nerf (5 percent maybe?). i think maybe if rolling reload also  gave darryl a +10% super charge rate it would be pretty viable.
---
Language lol

Alternatively, add coin, gem and ticket offers in the star shop so star points are actually useful

I've got my hopes up my man :D

nope not true

I appreciate you trying to bring the behaviors of the top players to light. I don‚Äôt know how much good it will do however since many already hold them in a negative light and supercell will not take action against those at the top of the games leaderboards.

Even if they remodeled it, it would be the same character

And your flair isn't even brock

Yeah. And God forbid they add another brock skin.

the reason why he cant is because hes touching ground attacking unlike basically every other attack ingame, even at the CS speed he just cant actually just run across an assumably deep water body, taking in mind gravity and stuff

There‚Äôs a Creepy Harvest (bats) at 0:14 in the video. He‚Äôs the only Mortis so it has to come from him. And he clearly has Coiled Snake enabled as he states in his comments in this post. So that‚Äôs 2 specials. How?

Piper and Shelly teamed up. There is no way that matchmaking algorithm would do that, because that isn‚Äôt how matchmaking works. Hope I helped

Sigh *unzips*

Anti-teaming
---
yikes i usually stop after 2 lost games to avoid huge tilts lol. this SD map does suck, but i also don‚Äôt play showdown bcuz i find the 3v3 modes more interesting. i pushed him on Four Squared from 300 to 400 trophies one day, but he is really strong on other thrower-heavy maps since tanks are less prevalent. if you do plan on pushing him in gem grab remember he‚Äôs not a gem carrier and shouldn‚Äôt carry gems unless it‚Äôs a clutch situation. i do recommend getting a team aswell lol but he‚Äôs definitely doable with randoms (i push every brawler with randoms). i wish you luck on your mortis journey ;))))

and if you want to play w me lmk bht i don‚Äôt think i‚Äôm that good

I hate her voice since she sounds like a 6 yr old with some corny ass lines, she's great ngl, my favorite brawler but that voice... Makes me want to not use her especially the "Konnichi-whack" line
---
Decent idea in theory, but accidental own goals are part of the game too. When your team is pushing hard, a lot times an enemy player accidentally backs into their goal with the ball. These goals absolutely need to count and your barrier idea would prevent that. I believe supercell does have an algorithm that tracks own goals and if someone is doing it constantly, they will get banned.
---
Why was it removed, I never watched it
---
The problem with the report button in this game is that players can abuse it by false-reporting players. Unless Supercell has a commitment to check the reports from, what I guess, tens of thousands of players globally, I can‚Äôt see how it would work.
---
It does work however in one case that I saw. Blizzard‚Äôs Overwatch banned xQc (a streamer) for false reporting players, putting details in his report which says ‚Äúf‚Äô you‚Äù for every report he made. Action could be taken quickly because he did it live on stream, which is evidence.
---
Another mobile game I played before, Vainglory, also had a report button. Apparently from all the options available (AFK, Trolling, etc) only report made for AFK players work. The others are just placeholders and no action is taken to the offender.
---
I don‚Äôt know if that many one-tile spaces are allowed, and there‚Äôs a random fence at the bottom left
---
It‚Äôs mostly been done by individual brawler trophies with an advantage placed on the people who enter the MM pool without a premade team.

On the event choosing screen its showing that it is a retropolis map while it is a cave map.

Lol ur so bad. Today I dominated with him in showdown. Even got him to 500, and I was playing aggro mortis NOT bushcamping and running mortis
---
This actually made me uninstall game. I was so angry, i lost 12 trophies in a row.
---
People are getting 1000 trophies now? Damn. Son.
---
This shit happens so much its insane. In a game where inting is very likely, im surprised that Supercell hasn't added a report function.
---
My guess : the ball was exactly on the line and they were afraid to move it inside, so they waited for their teammate to respawn. And then Dynamike.

Aw that sucks. I mean your chances are probably high if you don‚Äôt have a legendary yet. So don‚Äôt worry!

Hmm...  Waiting for others comment and what you said....  Correct
---
Nope but we can play mortis against so many brawlers, right
---
Also should*
---
frank said it‚Äôs difficult to launch games their and they need to be ready for a huge amount of players so it took some time
---
I also noticed it
---
It's so true tho
---
Did he just quickfire with colt what a noob
---
Sad but tru
---
I mean bruh...every brawler has its counters, so does mortis. If there is a close range brawler just run away. If there is a colt, rico, spike, crow, dyna and even leon you should be beating them. You can either dodge their shots and corner them, then attack when ur in their range. And mortis requires a lot of skill, so thats why hes probably bad to you, because you are trash. And btw mortis' best gamemode is bounty because he can get rid of those  squishy brawlers that are being played in bounty, for example piper, brock, colt etc. You can DOMINATE with mortis in a lot of ways. You just need a lot of skill ;)
---
You said that posts dont get removed so if they really care they should find the original post and link it. I said that it¬¥s hard and not doing it doesn't mean they dont care

10 out of 10. Perfect redrawing!

Then im far from that eh

That is because you have unlocked all brawlers except to legendaries. Tour luck value would have been way too low but just increased now

Tbh,i bought two,i still need crow tho,i mean,for f2p with shitty luck like me,i recommend getting skins as in my opinion,flexing on the people in showdown is really fun
---
True tho. Like bold of them to assume I have nearly everything Max
---
Mid ranged? She almost has the range of a crow. Showdown is now an infestation of shellys controlling the map. What else did I say? She definitely can chain her supers one after another and you'd definitely put her super as game changing. Its guaranteed one shot kill if she can charge it. It's definitely up there with Tara's as the strongest in the game

3k is shit, i‚Äôm at 7.6k and don‚Äôt have any legendary

Low trophies right?

The first supercell game I started to play first was clash of clans my cousin suggested that game to me at first I was not into it much but when I reached th7 I was deep in this game and it has been 6 years since I played clash of clans, then slowly by slowly I started playing hay day, boom beach and then finally my second favorite supercell game Brawl stars. My player ID is #2C220LQ
---
Still plays the music tho
---
Ok, u will get 6 megaboxes and some another boxes in the trophy road, but it gives you alsoo another brawlers(not legendary) , and it not so much. I saved over 100 boxes and 12 big boxes during 1 month of playing, so after 6 months you have got over 600 BB and 72 Big boxes, it is much more than trophy road boxes.

Side to side, side side to side

Yeah that could be good idea
---
Same but i have Mortis too (but i reached 7k with only Mortis)
---
Yeah, but remember there is also a luck system connected with the chance one
---
Been Playing since year two of Clash of Clans, I played for about 3 years (All I wanted for my birthdays was money for clash of clans) Then I tried Boom Beach and Hay Day. Finally, Clash Royale released, and I was completely in love with it! (Royale is #3 on my all time favorite games list, beating Minecraft, and right after Mario Kart and Brawl Stars ;)   ). I played way too much Royale to start Brawl Stars until around Global release, and I can't imagine stopping. Brawl Stars is AWESOME! Would be amazing to get a skin with two of my favorite characters mixed into one!!

I thank you for representing our representative

Yeah, getting it first out of the thousand or last out of the thousand
---
I think it depends on the type of game and maps you play,for example in showdown he has lots of counters and several maps are not in his favor. A lot of range and melee brawlers can kill him on 3 basics as well.

Thanks for the compliment

I started playing Supercell games shortly after Clash of Clans was released in 2012. One of the first things I remember shortly after playing the game was the first Halloween update. I've played Boom Beach and Clash Royale a little bit, but Brawl Stars is my go to game now. I love being able to play a quick, fun and competitive game.
---

---
Yeah but 1 point isn't much per match so even if somebody rates you wrongly it won't matter
---
In 2015 when I first played Clash of Clans,  I was a very terrible player in it and I only managed to reach till town Hall 4, and I had heard of the new  game,  supercell release.  Then I tried that game and thought that if a play it nicely,  I could be a good player.  So I played it with full confidence and now HERE I AM with -7500 trophies.

Started playing clash royale and clash of clans when my friends recommended me to play those games and I had very much fun! After two years I started playing brawl stars and I think that it's the best game I've ever played!

---
what'd you use him in to push to 500?
---
Buff will make that the 6th highest in the game next to Primo Frank Bull Rosa and Carl. HE WILL HAVE ALMOST HAVE THE HEALTH OF A TANK. Tanks have already have a slightly higher moving speed than normal brawlers to make up for their range and make it easier to come closer to other ppl. Assassins like Mortis have an ever higher speed than tanks. Have you ever tried to fight a Rosa close to you? Unless your a Shelly with super ready or a Bull its very hard to defeat that amount of hp in a short time. This would be the same with Mortis, except that he has 1 a higher speed 2 can use his attacks to come even more close.
---
Youre saying he shouldnt have the same health as  Nita and Poco, but Nita does not do a lot of damage with a short range and will lose against a tank if too close and Poco does not do a lot of damage either, he is a healer so him having a decent amount of health makes sense. 
---
Attack: him having a ridiculous amount if health making it almost impossible for most brawlers to deal with him since he can easily come closer was apparently not good enough. Currently a maxed Mortis does 1260 damage, which means he can 3 shot 6 brawlers, and 4 shot 16. Increasing his damage to 1350 means he will 3 shot 9 brawlers and 4 shot 18 (!) brawlers there meaning only 9 brawlers would be safe from him if he has super. 
---
Reload: his low reload is the thing which annoys me the most of Mortis. If I got a gem for everytime I could stop countdown or get the last stars if it was slightly faster...
---
But decreasing it to 2 seconds is not the way to do that. Youre saying because Poco has that reload and he is not OP Mortis wouldnt be OP either. But Poco has really really low damage and burst damage and is much  different brawler than Mortis is and I just dont think you can compare the 2 like that. With a reload this fast he could  (1260x6=7560) 6 shot a Primo in only a few secs .. assuming he has his 3 ammo bar full that means it would only take him 3 more ammo so 3x2=6 secs to destroy a Primo. Primo! The brawler with ths highest health would be able to be destroyed in 6 seconds! 
---
Range: as you said his range and his mechanics are what makes him special and unic in this game.
---
I‚Äôd pay 300 gems for this beauty. Great idea
---
But 1 -1 means nothing it's so small unless everyone just votes you bad every time in which case maybe you are bad it won't matter
---
Brock fits in everything.üòÖüòÖüòÖ

Maybe a babarian el primo skin

Just get both,it‚Äôs too hard of a decision

Started playing this game since beta. This game has come a long way from landscape to weird Nita anatomy. I've only play this game cause I saw bunch of youtuber play on a reveal tournament

#RGRYRQGU

I find tick to be more of a long ranged barley  and barley isn't great in showdown so I dont think tick is good in showdown it's likely his worst mode but still not a bad mode he's better in modes that barley is good in like gem grab, heist, siege but his long range makes him good in bounty too.

There is 90% chance for negative gems i guess.

Every bralwer is like this
---
i like it
---
Lucky
---
Shelly was shooting
---
And I cant really calculate the consequences of a buff of that so ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
Conclusion: youre buffs will make Mortis from a weaker brawler to a terror. Those suggestion to nerf the starpowers won't help because he will be insanely OP even without. Thanks for reading.

I started playing supercell games around (2013) when clash of clans was a big fad in my school and i remember signing up early for clash royale's release.
---
Some people are straight up like that.
---
Primo you dirty scumbag
---
well how leon say someting?
---
But I don't see the connection with Primo and barbarian...Darryl and barb barrel is similar due to the fact that Darryl's super and barb barrel's deployment is, well, rolling...so I think Primo would be better with a mega knight skin rather than a barbarian skin....just my opinion tho

First supercell game I have ever played was hay day, but I didn't know what supercell was back then. I started playing clash royale in 2016,and I played until maybe start of the 2019, I am sad beacause cr is now soo pay2win.
---
Side side to side
---
That doesn't change the fact that he's outclassed by a lot of other brawlers in that map.
---
"removing clothes for kill" is ok. using piper in title or screaming cartoon is not ok.
---
I feel like nerf is coming soon...Mortis always get some kind of nerf.
---
He may be a mix of free and pay to win

why shouldn't you be able to rate someone good when maybe you know that game you played terribly

Started playing since the beggining of clash of clans. I saw my brother playing it and i was like wow what a cool game what is it's name and he told me and started playing and playing and having so much fun. Then i discovered that they had another game called hay day i played it as well. But played clash of clans a bit more. Then came the release of clash royale where i got so addicted to it i played since the very first beggining of the game. Immediatly gave up on clash of clans this game made it look like really boring. Finally some youtubers made videos about a new supercell game called brawl stars at the beggining i was like there is absolutely no way this is better than clash royale so i didn't even kept watching the video. At that time i was so obsessed with downloading apps that were paid for free, i had an app that does exactly that and saw brawl stars there since it was only available in canada and i dont live in canada so i was like why is it here, whatever lemme just download it and see what it is all about i had really high hopes that i will not gonna like it but then OMGGG i fell in love like so muchhhh i couldn't stop playing. However it was crashing a lot mainly because i downloaded it from an app not from app store ( i had ios back then) so i got kinda mad that everytime i have to reinstall it althought it wasn't like reseting or something i can continue from where i was. So anyways my cousin(he has android phone so he couldn't do it)told me about a video that eclihpse made about making a candian apple id and changing your app store country to canadian. So i did it and it worked and first brawler i wanted was mortis and kept playing and playing because i had so much fun and i was hoping to get mortis (btw clash royale instantly got deleted from my mind i was like how in the world did i even liked this game) got mortis the very first day of landscape update where i was like what did they do to this game and wasn't having fun anymore mainly because there was autoaim and tap to shoot was gone but never though about quitting so because they changed the progression system again xd all the pins badges medals were converted to brawl boxes so i opened them and got mortis and tara. Well i was happy but also sad and angry cause he was so uselless because of auto aim and his dash range was nerfed like 100 times. Anyways they made the game much better and now i enjoy it so much thanks for this AMAZING game supercell

Started playing Clash of Clans about 4 or 5 years ago. My work has sporadic free time and lots of travel. Perfect for phone games. Played a little Boom Beach. Played a little Hayday. My wife still likes that one. When I found Clash Royale I got hooked hard. I pretty much stopped playing Clash of Clans then. Loved the strategy and the real time fights. I started watching Youtubers for strategy and new card reveals and one showed a preview for Brawl Stars. I told my wife this will be my new game. And it wasn't even available yet! I was so upset. I checked for it every now and then and gave up hope after a year or so of waiting. The second I saw it was available it was instantly downloaded and I have been playing it ever since. And it's one that both my wife and I enjoy. SuperCell is always putting out interesting and innovative games. If there's a new one you can be sure I'll minimum give it a try and probably get addicted like the others. Keep up the good work!

I started playing supercell games in mid 2016 when my friend recommended me to play coc as he said its fun and addictive and i started my coc journey and to be true i seriously fell in love with the game , was super addictive to coc that i spent like 6-10hrs a day for 2 full year on it and still play it till today , in 2017 i searched for more supercell games and found cr to be my next big game , played for few months but didn't got a fond of it and heard about the brawl star beta in mid 2018 but couldn't download it as i was an Android player but now that i have it , i started in dec 2018 and have reached 19k trophies in the game , seriously all supercell games are so addictive and best in category that i couldn't wait for what game they come up next with.

I don't know for sure but maybe in 3v3 a bot takes over to help the remaining teammates at have a chance, in showdown a player being taken over by a bot would only help the afk player so there is no need to not them.

I started playing Supercell game since early 2017 when I got into high school. I watched my friends playing Clash Royale and downloaded it immediately. We were so in to this game, we had our own clan and created our own challenges and tournaments.

Supercell games have always been popular in my schools over the years. I started with COC in elementary, but Clash Royale is really where I got started. I played every day, and me and my friends loved every second.

Look where the Carl originally was, then when the storm reaches that place start counting to 7

nah i‚Äôm not that cute

I thought this was a joke, but then I get on Brawl Stars, check the shop and it right there. Wtf?
---
Y O T U B E
---
Carl is now the strongest brawler in the game because he can say the n word
---
Honesty if they just changed the "feature" where his dash gets stopped if you are close to a wall/corner and made him kinda ride the wall instead I think that would be enough of a buff
---
Teaming has reached the limit
---
How many brawlers do you have
---
I would plz bring back season rewards
---
I love how Nita is drinking an energy drink
---
Do you think chance system is fair at the moment? Do you think a new player deserves a legendary while a player is 10k does not have a single one? Do you think it is fair to get a legendary at 500 or less trophies is fair while people that 10k or more cant get one? This would be the update that all community would love.

Good mortis players have said themselves that mortis is underwhelming in most scenarios. The only times that he is really good is at the top of ladder in some 3v3 modes, and even then not often. I know that he's a high skill cap brawler, vut that cap is so high that 99% of players will never be able to play with them. That means that he is HARD TO USE. To hard to use, which indicates that he might need a small buff in order to allow other players to even consider playing him. Even if the threshold drops to 90%, this will let more players use the brawler.

Started to playing clash of clans around the end of 2013 and played it ever since with my cousins and that‚Äôs was the best thing imo supercell ever done ,connecting people with their games and I‚Äôm happy they kept it in their new releases.in 2016 came some news of a new game clash Royale which waited so patiently for its soft lunch in Canada that in my time zone I waited till 4am, thank you chief pat our rocket science for all the good memes that me and my friends at high school enjoyed a lot,not to be surprised another supercell game was announced and that is brawl stars ,the most game I ever spent much time on (no going strong with the third year) it‚Äôs been the most fun roller coaster of changes that really shaped the game to how it is now and I‚Äôm really thankful they didn‚Äôt cancel it because I can‚Äôt go on with the day unless I play it so thank you supercell and I wish you success.happy birthday üéÇ

I first heard about brawlstars in December when my cousin told me about the cool new supercell game that had come out. I had borrowed people phones to play COC or CR but I‚Äôd never downloaded them on my own. However, I got brawlstars and loved it‚Äôs more active feel. Currently have 10k trophies and all brawlers but the mythics. #PUGOLURG

It‚Äôs because I couldn‚Äôt bear drawing scrappy injured. Lenny in the other hand, lol he can go **screw** himself
---
The odds for getting a legendary is too low; don‚Äôt get me wrong. I think they should increase the odds for legendaries and mythical, but not letting new players get legendaries just doesn‚Äôt make sense. It‚Äôs ok for a low player to get a legendary. It‚Äôs exciting. But if you think that new players shouldn‚Äôt get legendaries just cause you don‚Äôt get them, you‚Äôre just salty.

They removed seasonal tokens also for low level players and that's kinda unfair because they get like 0 star points and also no tokens at the end of the season (I'm 14k trophies, just so you know üòâ).
---
Also why do you have to be so mad if you  just had shitty teammates in the first match you played in weeks ü§î
---
Maybe is average with his star power, but supercell keeps forgetting that not all of us have level 9 brawlers and not app of is are endgame players that want skins. I speak as a level 8 Mortis with 720 trophies. Without star power, he is weak

I started playing since 2017. Then I saw that they‚Äôre making a new game I waited for a year and a half for this game to come out globally.  I started playing brawl stars since Christmas. Tag: #2L2GYLGO

It‚Äôs ok to be wrong. If the animation was actually different, it wouldn‚Äôt be an 80 gem skin. But it‚Äôs not different. So it‚Äôs 80 gems.

Awesome idea

Lol, wow, he was my clubmate before I got kicked for not changing my profile picture. Brock is actually viable on some of the more open brawl ball maps however
---
This is just my opinion but 70% of the games I play, are with randoms and they are just fine. I see nothing wrong with playing with randoms. Yeah, some of them are trolls, but if nobody you know is on, what are you gonna do, waste potential tokens and trophies.

I played supercell games since 2014 and I installed brawl stars when global realesed. I didn't have I phone so I couldn't install brawl stars in beta.

because backstabbing is toxic, and on 600+ trophies you won't be able to live up to the sixth place, because if someone sees that you backstabbed someone he won't team with you, or even he will start cornering you with his team. teaming is a tactic for 600+ trophies and if you don't team with the teamers they will squeeze you. also according to this subreddit everyone on 900 brawler trophies or above is a noob bEcAuSe He TeAmS (i used google translate because i know english very bad)

My friends recommended me clash of clans when it cane out, and I immediately fell in love with it. Still playing it to this date. When I found out you guys had more games I started playing those too. I even played hay day for a while, but shorter than any of the other games. When brawl stars came out I was really excited. In my opinion it is the best game on mobile.

How many SPs you have and how many can you unlock?

I don't even have maxed brawlers

So, basically Sanji from One Piece w/ a mexican guitar

In 2017, all people in my school started playing clash royale so i joined them. The first time i knew about brawl stars was when i saw the trailer . Then i forgot about the game because it was still in beta. One day i saw a brawl stars video on my recommandation page . I become addicted to those videos and couldn't wait for the global release so i joined just 3 days after the android release.

I first started playing Hay day when it came out with my older sister (I‚Äôm an OG ;)). As I got older I started getting into Boom Beach and Clash of Clans (in around 2014). I saw all the hype for clash royale and decided to play it when it came out and stuck with it for 2 years straight while I slowly moved away from clash of clans. I continued playing clash royale until Brawl Stars global release, and I eventually got so into brawl stars that I stopped playing clash royale entirely.

In 2015, when Clash of Clans was relatively popular I tried it out, but it wasn‚Äôt my type of game. I didn‚Äôt play any Supercell games until Clash Royale was released a year later in 2016. To this day I still enjoy playing CR, but ever since Brawl Stars was released globally I‚Äôve spent a lot more time on it.

Insert obligatory 'but what about Leon' comment
---
Then the title doesn't make much sense. To know  John Cena, and his catchphrase, you have to know WWE. To know Leon's super, you need to know Brawl Stars. Knowing Brawl Stars and WWE doesn't make anyone intellectual. I hope you see that now.

Sweet comment and awesome to know

I didnt wanna read the whole thing because im lazy, and poco is one of the weakest brawlers in the game according to pros! And ur not a pro so you dont have the rights to say which brawlers are good/bad. And ur getting blocked because I dont want to have this conversation anymore. Mortis is a balanced brawler. Bye bye now. Oh btw if you didnt know, if I block you I cant see any more of your replies and comments. So yeah its pointless for you to reply to this comment. Bye!

i might be playing simce then but i stayed an tear without playing so still in 9k so ur better i guess

WHERE DO I SIGN?

About 6 years ago, I played my first Supercell game, Boom Beach. After a while, I stopped playing. I started playing Supercell games again in December 2016. My next game was Clash Royale. I heard about it from one of my friends who started playing a few months before me and am still playing Clash Royale every once in a while. I also started Clash of Clans and Hay Day but dropped both of them. I started playing Brawl Stars in global and still play actively.

I dont see what's wrong

  have a problem which is that new brawlers do not touch me and there are profiles of players who have fewer cups than me and have more brawlers and I have also opened more than 90 common boxes and 10 large boxes and I do not touch any brawler besides my possibilities do not increase please help me with this problem :(
---
Health wise yes but overalls I think he is still good. Especially with his new star power
---
Hmmm idk... Supercell and a killer machine don't mix (but it would be sick af if it did)

At the end the super joystick controls the regular attack

One block gap in the middle, impossible to grab gems unless you have dynamikes first SP or you are using either Primo, Crow or Piper

Oh

And other subs don't already have AutoMod doing this *becaaauuuuuuuuuuuse*......???????????
---
Yes, that is completely fine. Teaming is only acceptable when you are facing teamers.
---
Started playing clash of clans in 2014. Lots of my friends were on it so I joined in too. Left the game when they removed farming :( Moved onto Royale when it released globally and then started Brawl stars when android was soft launched. Had been watching the game develop for months and was so thrilled to finally play it.

I started over 3-4 years ago not long after clash royale was released i really got into it and after a year i reached like 3. something k trophies. But the game was making me frustrated so i quit and tried out clash of clans it is a nice game but not really my type. And then i stoped playing any supercell game and swore to never touch a supercell game again. But then December 2018 came and brawl stars was released globally. I was skeptical at first thinking that it's yet another clash game. I gave it a try and i wasn't disappointed since i'm still playing it and it's easily the best game you have ever released. I'm at 15.2k trophies currently and i'm glad that the game is different to the other supercell games.

Welp, I'm desperate for skins, so here I go. I started playing CoC in 2015 because I was 1. bored and 2. liked how the game looked. I then started to play Clash Royale in 2016 because a friend told me to play it, then I downloaded Boom Beach and Hay Day to see what the other Supercell games were like. I then stopped playing Supercell games for like 2 years because I just felt they were just too p2w and I don't have the time or money to put into them, then I saw a friend of mine play Brawl Stars so I thought I should give it a try, and well, look where I am now, at 12.5k trophies and desperate for a skin.

Unfortunately supercell did buff crow because the reddit was going like this, and look at crow now. Crow is a ranged brawler, but mortis is melee. Crow can drive enemies off, mortis cannot. However buffed mortises attack power can be, his reload and attack speed will always limit him to non-melee characters including shotgunners

I have started playing Supercell games since elementary school. The first Supercell game I played was Clash of Clans. In fact, I still play the game today. When Clash Royale was announced I was global going global was very excited. I pre-registered for the game. Unfortunately, I lost interest in Clash Royale and stopped playing the game. Brawl Stars was global I was excited to play the game because I waited for  Brawl Stars to release before it was announced that it was even going global. I also pre-registered for Brawl Stars too and told my friends about the next Supercell game. Right now I am playing Brawl Stars daily and waiting for the next update. My player tag is #8GY9P9Y8.

Pam i guess

Sorry it took me so long to respond no I think it's also people just stopping and maxing every brawler I very much had time to get to 700 but I was basically trying to get 500 with brawlers I hate.

**Chapter 1: the beginning**
---
Whay back in March of 2016 my friend told me about a new game, Clash Royale, we played "together" (because way back then the game didn't had 2v2) i always liked this game, i was addicted, but considering i was actually 8 years old i only managed to get 400 trophies, i wasn't that good at all...
---
**Chapter 2: trying out new games**
---
When i was 9 i started searching for other Supercell games, i found out Clash of Clans and Hay Day, that i enjoyed really much, then i started playing all 4 Supercell games, i was talking about it to all my friends and family members to play with them too...
---
**Chapter 3: Brawl Stars announcement**
---
When i discovered about Brawl Stars in soft launch i was like, literally **HYPE OVERLOAD** i am Brazilian but i had access to a Canadian account at play store and so i started to play...
---
**Chapter 4: finding love**
---
Brawl Stars was (and still is) my favorite games, i was 10 and a half at the time so i wasn't so good, i played when it was vertical and we used elixer...
---
**Chapter 5: GLOBAAAAAAL**
---
I watched the "we need to talk" stream, i was afraid of it going deleted, but also hyped if it got global, and when it launched here on Brazil i Started playing straight away...
---
**Chapter 6: aftermath**
---
I am now 13, i play Brawl Stars every day and spend a whole ton of money, cause, i love supporting my favorite games, and now a am in 14200 Trophies
---
P.S: i know it was long but, it is my story resumed, if you read all the way to here, thank you,
