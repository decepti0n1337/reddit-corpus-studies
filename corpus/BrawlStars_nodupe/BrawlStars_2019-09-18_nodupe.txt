So you camped in a bush the whole game and still almost choked the game at the end?
---
---
---
Most people like piper and jessie more because they are cute
---

---
But seriously shelly is cute (no homo)
---
Happy cake day bro!
---
Yeah your right though im blaming coach cory for suggesting a nerf about the homerun star power
---
Would‚Äôve been a brilliant meme if you didn‚Äôt have the word crow and just had the picture
---
Ye that true
---
Can someone enlighten this normie on the meme? I saw one of this names on his videos and I'm confused
---
I have hyper bear so I'm glad it got buff so watch my bear go sicko mode
---
When i saw 8 bit....
---
#what the fuck did you bring upon this cursed land
---
Bibi's homerun doesnt even need a nerf
---
Same
---
K
---
Thanks for wasting my time
---
I was thinking the same thing
---
I knew i would find this comment,take my updoot
---
Username checks out though
---
Wtf
---
Ahhhahaha my bad 4 minutes is not that bad tho i was mainly trying to flex with my measly 6 23
---
Chill
---
Just because a no-kill brawler killed a no-skill brawler doesn‚Äôt make the one that died bad
---
Jiang Shi is a kind of monster in Chinese fantasies, they‚Äôre similar to zombies
---
Ho ho, then come as close as you like
---
It was still extremely strong. Piper was still competitively good in places she should not be in. Source: Bralw Stars World Cup
---
I‚Äôm still at 5.5k lol, great for you
---
How is that related to this
---
Are you new around here?

If you want to see more, you can see the related video on my Youtube channel[shootinclay](https://youtu.be/98N26Sj5fhQ)

All I really wish is that they switch angry robo with life leech
---
Because that is the only way he could possibly deny the goal. This post is stupid....
---
I don't think so. You know, support team never was the best one in this kind of things like helping in ACTUAL gameplay
---
Can relate
---
Why mortis nerfed
---
It's u/Star-Twist
---
Lol, somehow I still found myself 
---
Thanks for using it :D
---
(Now I can't unsee star-tweet)
---
His name is a big Mouth deference lol
---
Brasil uhuuuu
---
I mean... Instagram
---
They should at least make her auto-aim from a distance
---
DANG LOL IM FAMOUS! Ty op
---
Yeah
---
Why leon dont speak? Have to much fans ho maked fandubs
---
That would be me
---
Yes, they are, unless they get replaced by a Brawler.
---
They could do seasonal changes or maybe make the characters move in the loading screen
---
So thats what thousand lakes and the other maps were taken off still miss thousand lakes
---
fuck that guy ima send him dicks
---
An accurate display of colt players /s
---
I know i don't.
---
Didn‚Äôt know this was done before sorry
---
I got all 3 from small brawl box
---
yes
---
I really like this one,also good when Christmas comes
---
Snapchat is more of a social app, where you get to text your friends and see what they were doing on their story. Reddit is more general, where you see see funny or interesting posts that random people from around the world made. Both great apps, but very different
---
No no no, it's perfectly fine.
---
It's up to apple for approval. USUALLY after brawl talk it'll be 2-3 days. Could be up to a week+ based on approval times though.
---
Sniper arena bro
---
I have 500 saved up from summer and I‚Äôm about to cash out on 18 star powers and sandy hopefully
---
Ok
---
Oh okay. Thanks a lot! Now I dont need to worry about my megabox disappearing :D
---
Luck!
---
yeah i really just want some feature and i dont think this would be too much to ask for
---
supercell makes a new brawler in a month so this should take no time
---
not really. first time posting about it though
---
i raged so hard lol
---
Just need to take like 20% of the bushes out and then perfection
---
Naw it‚Äôs always one of the mikes
---
i just hate it when people do this and now the thought that he did this to others??!!!
---
Thanks for the feedback!
---
&gt;Extra Life was waaaay OP
---
just kill 8-Bit long range and you are pretty much fine. if you kill him close range, just ignore the cubes and run to the closest wall (a 4x4 tiles wall will definitely work) and juke him, you can abuse his slow base speed and he will almost never reach you to your side of the wall, and then attack after his inmunity bubble dissapears.
---
In the case of Brawl Stars, they need to give a more refined model for a Brawler to easily make skins for them
---
Ok sorry, I generally considered shitposts to just be memes and stuff, I'll keep that in mind for posting here again.
---
No, its 100% Sandy when he is awake
---
Look at his hat
---
Just play tick
---
Lol
---
Sandy's range should stay the same but the time should be either 8 or 10 seconds because unlike leon, everyone will know where Sandy is because he's only invisible in the circle and if the circle was 1-2 tiles big, he wouldn't be able to move at all making him one of the worst brawlers In the game

This looks really good actually.

Let‚Äôs not forget band aid and snappy sniping
---
I felt like it could‚Äôve been a bit more impactful, maybe 350
---
It really isn‚Äôt the demands that mostly fuel their drive to remodel brawlers, but it‚Äôs more of the fact that they need a more refined 3D model to make it easier to create skins for them
---
The demanding is just unnecessary complaints from whiners
---
Whats with the random black space in the picture
---
That's cara Simon and his buddy likes
---
You could spawncamp in SD
---
Him and Pipers old models will be missed
---
All really good maps
---
Don't forget oh gosh time . Also hello fellow Dollars
---
4
---
It's like having more complicated bounty stars
---
Have they ever had Halloween skins?I've got 1k gems just waiting to be spent on some JackoSpike and Witch Jessie skins
---
thats a question not a fact
---
My best interpretation is this:
---
I know, but play spike instead 
---
My mom is coming after, sorry cant play
---
Marvel do you want to play with me?
---
Thats when I play with 8 bit
---
It was unfair for close range brawlers and allowed him to steal at least 2nd in every SD
---
And now it's my friend nicksi lmao
---
did you just screenshot your own post and post it?
---
You kids have it good. Back in my day the game you got was the final product and the loading screen was the final loading screen. *Shakes fist*
---
I thought we were Windows 9?
---
This some how works in a weird way.

And with hyper bear

ok this is funny
---
y humor hough
---
This is the opposite definition of America
---
Can you all stop reposting this shit
---
The update will launch tomorrow
---
And also(GONE WRONG/ NO CLICKBAIT!!!)
---
just dont auto-aim you ninky nonk
---
I feel like you are a 5k player with leon
---
Nice Fanart! I really like the flames. Keep up the good work!
---
Absolute mad lad pushing multiple brawlers to rank 35
---
Thank you
---
1) barleys was completely unnecessary 
---
2) idc for carls, but I dont really like how they are nerfing his mechanic.
---
3) "brocks 1st is outshined by his 2nd" no matter what u do with the first one its pretty trash. But I would say it's actually just as good if u know how to use it. It's used for area control. If u block on path off he cant dodge or he will take possibly 1k dmg now.
---
The buff was actually useful.
---
4) pam didnt need a buff, wasnt she nerfed because people were complaining that she was good? (Which is terrible considering she was balanced)
---
5) De capo was good, dont mind the buff tho.
---
6) screeching solo didnt need a nerf. It already did less than 1 mortis slash at first, then it dealt less dmg than a nita attack, and now it deals less than pocos basic attack at lvl 5.
---
Like cmon now, who complains about this? Poco himself is a balanced brawler, he only needed something that would help him and that is screeching solo. Well, until people complained about it.
---
Now it's useless unless poco can finish a dude off. Poco himself doesn't need a buff.
---
7) carrion crow was already good, it didnt need a buff. 
---
8) extra toxic was fine and actually did alot more than people think, I dont care much for the buff though
---
Crow himself doesnt need a buff, hell he recieved a buff before that he didnt actually need. Yall better be happy he got this.
---
9) el primo is meh
---
10) "coiled snake good nerf" didnt need a nerf, completely uncalled for.
---
"It makes mortis 100% a better brawler" that's what star powers are for.
---
"Mortis needs a buff, hes so reliant on his star powers "
---
Mortis doesnt need a buff, and his star powers only make him stronger (like they are supposed to)
---
Just dont nerf the dude like yall are ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
11) tick needs a nerf to how long his mines last, his range should stay unique, and he should get a buff to how fast his mines hit the ground.
---
That would be a good rework.
---
12) band aid is still good, just not broken like people want it to be. It still allows her to win match ups that she couldnt before. Both shell shock and band aid are equally useful.
---
Shell shock for 3v3 and band aid for solo modes and showdown. Pretty good in gem and bb too.
---
13)homerun didnt need a nerf, and batting stance is not inferior to homerun, tired peoplesay8ng this. They are equally useful and both have thier draw backs.
---
Homerun allows u to get close and dodge shots but u take full damage.
---
Batting stance allows u to tank the dmg and u can still dodge (just not as well as homerun)
---
Also u could just walk the ball in.
---
14) 8bit didnt need a nerf to his star power, it was already balanced. 
---
I guess people just stand next to a respawning enemy in duo showdown and think its op.
---
15) snappy sniping when it was first released needed a nerf, shre I'll accept that. Now it feels balanced but still abit underwhelming.
---
BUT NOW THEY ARE GONNA MAKE IT WEAK AS HELL. It was already balanced not to mention it's the only star power in the game that actually requires skill yet they want to make it garbage instead.
---
It by no means is stronger than ambush, especially after this nerf.
---
16) people bitch about rosa getting buffed, when she really didnt need all those nerfs that she got before.
---
Git gud kids.
---
17) nita, not complaining because I dont play hiest alot. Not to mention its gonna be a pain in the ass for mortis, and in big game.
---
I never believed either one of nitss star powers were stronger than the other but damn, cocaine bear all the way.

Hey I‚Äôve seen this one before.
---
I like the art style. Have you thought of making more?
---
Im just going to leave it at 69 upvotes
---
Bruh thats mean to just post a persons post again, just because u put who made it doesnt mean u can just post it like that and get free karma
---
Niceu
---
That‚Äôs going to be a nightmare üòÇ
---
Haha yeah I guess that works too.
---
Thank you bro
---
Hands of my crew!
---
I posted this 2 years ago :P
---
When leon gets closed to people during super they see him faded but at shark skin they should see thebfin sticking out
---
Thank you!!
---
penny was so mad because mortis said i don't know to her question so she killed him
---
Yep but very soon. You can some other of my fanart on my instagram.üòä
---
Randoms...
---
Whaaaat?!?! You really forgit about me!?!
---
I would like the loading screen to be some nice art of the latest brawler
---
Cool idea but if you check oj's new video, they removed the star in the middle.
---
People, Tara is already good with her super, she should stay that way because her super is game changing, being able to teamwipe a whole enemy team, if her reload speed was faster then she would be broken by charging her super faster and teamwiping easier.
---
Whatch out its a trap!
---
But... erratic blocks? There are too many throwers in this map, and they are really a big threat.
---
Night witch looks hella sexy
---
What about shinobi sandy?
---
My guess is that the bullets that would have hit the shelly were deleted by the wall you broke. If you look closely you can actually see the gaps in your super.
---
 The same effect happens with colt's super where each bullet disappears after it breaks a wall.
---
All in all just an unlucky shot.
---
They're working on a battle pass directly taken from Fortnite where they will add backgrounds skins and coins and maybe music
---
What is even crow. Never had one :(
---
*Ah yes, enslaved entertainment.*
---
im pretty sure this isn't right, because the took his chili pepper
---
Hola super cell tengo una idea al respecto de el le√≥n queria hacer una sugerencia para hacer una skin de un le√≥n para el le√≥n ser√≠a divertido ver una skin as√≠ cualquier cosa o aviso me hablan a trav√©s de Brawl stars mi ID es #9V8P98JVP no tengo ni un skin echo en concreto pero solo era una idea que quer√≠a acotar
---
Yup I'm the real
---
Impressive!
---
WRONG
---
yeah, I only saw so many boxes with maxed accounts
---
Was the racist term necessary?
---
I agree
---
Yeah, I just opened a big box today by mistake.
---
I haven‚Äôt gotten a new brawler for the past 7 months.
---
do you think that i can get to rank 35 just playing showdown?
---
i have no clue why but this cracked me up
---
I believe in you believing in me.
---
Yeah I like that too, I hate trying to get to 1 spot in a replay to show my friend, they miss it and you have to go through the whole game again
---
Hang in there buddy. The wait might be long but you‚Äôll get crow someday
---
Spike's a plant
---
LOOOL
---
It do be like that sometimes

:)))))))0)

Hey Cara Simon

Hola en el juegos de brawl stars nose puede escuchar musics se sale cuamdo pongo el juegos me gustaria que ses igual que clash of clan cuando estoy jugamdo puedo escuchar musics trankilo mientra estoy jugando
---
No he didn‚Äôt. Unless your friend is u/CoachFlapJack
---
Yea but a guy plant
---
I know, I was clearly joking as well.
---
I should have done this before the incoming nerf. Oops.
---
Any skill to discover reddit?! ü§£
---
Just as bad, when you have your super charged in OT and your dumb teammate WON‚ÄôT pass you the ball so you can score before the other team respawns.
---
It only happens because it says he is alive and he still in bubble
---
Congrats on rank 50! Really love this idea as well. Keep up the great work, my guy.
---
They are 0.0672
---
The durty shark))
---
your tactics are gonna work well in lone star
---
Appreciated it :)
---
Content is great, but don't beg next time
---
Red wizard barley is like that enemy wizard from clash royale
---
AAAAND NOOOW I CAN SAAAAY... Where is the Lone Star?!
---
Hopefully the third slot will be bounty AND brawl ball. I cannot stand playing brawl ball every single day for my star token, and I don‚Äôt wanna wait 3 days to play bounty or siege.
---
I‚Äôll 1-up(down?) you
---
One word: Photoshop
---
Lmao, first the events won‚Äôt come up when the update comes live, it will take like days for the events to come in rotation, soo he still has time
---
Footbull charges into battle
---
I feel like some youtuber showed something like this before.
---
That is cool idea :) to gamers)
---
Be Carried is a big mood
---
I just saved up 30 gems and got him for free.
---
:DDDDDD
---
Sooo reality dude
---
Sanstorm
---
SANEEEEEES, WANNA HAV BAD TOM?!!!!
---
I can actually play well but don't like pushing
---
Sandy... If you are?
---
Made me lol waaaay harder than I should have‚Ä¶ Keep up the good work!
---
Nice name
---
Hey!!!! Its should be a maps in CUPHEEAAAAAA... AAAAAAAAAAAEEHPUC
---
What‚Äôs this even supposed to mean
---
Barley shall become the dominant brawler now
---
doubt. i played crow and i ended up paired with bulls
---
4 days baby
---
Oh, I thought you were talking about the power lvl's, but yea, that happens to me a lot
---
i might have done the math wrong but i think you have slightly higher than a 24.5% chance of getting sandy with ur 100 boxes
---
Ik how that is, deal with it all the time, in around 7200, dm me your user name maybe we can play together
---
Report him, if a player gets reported for cursing at a player for teaming via entering they're club, they are banned for a day, same will apply to him
---
what are those
---
And the update ? Scroll a bit further
---
Is it just me or the old one is way better than new?
---
Yes hot maze is also back. I love it
---
For christmas they should just give us a free random brawler
---
legend
---
Did u say double tokens are bad?
---
What is pb?
---
yes right they should also nerf shell-shock too or nerf her Broken super chains
---
#Guys I‚Äôm shaking...
---
Why does it matter
---
auto caption  of YouTube working perfectly
---
A. It doesn't always work. F.e. If very little people pick throwers and you pick a throwers the game can't set up right match for you. And it throws you into a random match with assassins, etc. 
---
B. Crow and Bull are both assassins if played correctly.
---
HOLY- didn't expect you here Kairos, Love your content man, it helped me improve so much as a player in my early days :)
---
I hope it really happens, thanks.
---
He will be again OP with this buffs
---
I hope they give Poco some sort of Halloween skin cause he's basically already looks dead
---
What about Dragon Knight Mortis and his super is a Dragon that quickly flies over the map.
---
No I played 2 min ago and nothing
---
this is actually bad, something can go really wrong
---
Spike:
---
Get.
---
It‚Äôs because you‚Äôre in solo showdown.
---
This idea seems great to me
---
Maybe it won‚Äôt be eating sand.
---
That‚Äôs what I was doing and it just didn‚Äôt work out for me, like primos second star power I believe is the best star power for brawl ball and I have it but I seem to lose all the time because I literally have a bunch of teammates who are Leon or Poco and I have no clue why but they get the ball at the start of the match, run at the opposing team and just die. And then it continuously happens the whole match. I‚Äôve tried and literally lost 50 trophies and just started playing showdown but started being so calm and got up to 900 but then the map right now isn‚Äôt working for me so ig I‚Äôll wait tomorrow
---
Always 1%
---
Not happening bro
---
Nice
---
you forgot the star powers
---
Did that energy drink piper seriously auto-aim all 3 shots? Anyways, Good job!
---
There so skinny its amazing
---
Brilliant üòÇ
---
YESSS! I‚Äôm so excited!
---
Which editing app do you use? Just curious.
---
Finnaly
---
Yes
---
Ehrjanwmvlaown Ak k amebq rmsl2
---
Todays brawl ball map isn't made for Primo, I eould recomend a Piper/Brock for support, a Shelly for opening and a Pocho. Today's Showdown isnt that bad for Primo, you could do it.
---
Got a message saying game closing in 5 mins for maintanence break
---
I actually use iMovie to edit
---
Hi
---
Yes!! I just got kicked out
---
YAYAYAYAYAY

Thanks for compiling this list, Coach! Thank you very much!

And brings the most revenue I guess

Yes kemwj2ifn1kvp req 2bebwn!!!!!!!!!

He‚Äôs probably called ‚Äú???‚Äù, as that turns your name invisible.
---
Ok bois let do this
---
Got a message in game that maintenance is happening in 5 mins!
---
I just got on to try and play, that sucks tho
---
I hope!!!!!!!
---
I feel you, but hey, maybe it'll be a quick one!
---
Saying a kid "grow up"
---
Movement bug is not fixed, shit
---
Noice
---
LETS GO! CANT WAIT!
---
 I really like the ‚ÄúWIN‚Äù button
---
It is happening
---
Of course I don‚Äôt wanna bring down your great plays because they were great but your teammates seemed to be doing a great job while your opponents were the ones to miss braincells. The fact that your counter brawlers didn‚Äôt have star powers may have had a part as well. Still, really nice bats you got going üëç
---
Nice.
---
Friday.it seems like

YESS

Removed - DO NOT SUBMIT POSTS WITH TITLES IN ALL CAPS. CAPS LOCK IS CRUISE CONTROL FOR COOL

Just so you know. You can update it now

UPDATE INCOMING : D
---
lit won last game of brawl ball
---
Can‚Äôt wait to play the new game modes! 7 new maps for each?! That‚Äôs crazy good! üòÉüòÉ This could indeed be the best update since Landscape! =]
---
Its out now. Check your app store/playstore
---
Yess
---
Yea, i hope it‚Äôs the update but it‚Äôs 1 am for me so if it is a quick one I won‚Äôt be able to play
---
This is the old update
---
IKR. The OG days. I especially miss the thin rico
---
Thanks for all the hard work, Supercell.
---
Excited for the update.
---
About playing with you. I could play when I get back home to sweden in about 10 days (My wifi here is too risky to play with). My friends list if full but you‚Äôre welcome to join my party when I get home whenever (After the workday is over of course) :)
---
Love you 3000
---
wait............you have 6K ? i swear seeurlpcl is unfair
---
I love you both
---
UPDATES HERE NOW
---
That‚Äôs the joke
---
Imagine changing whole carl attacks and boss attacks just because less than 100 people beat insane xvi
---
Really disappointed about carl and mortis
---
Otherwise awesome work thank you
---
The prophet!
---
"okay you got skills"
---
Leta gooooo
---
I with this, i cant grind positive net trophies with randoms. im sitting 650 to 700
---
Thank you for the advice, I‚Äôll definitely try out brawl ball because I‚Äôm looking at the map and it doesn‚Äôt seem bad at all. And as for showdown I have the worst of luck with Shelly‚Äôs always camping at one of the boost, I played 3 games and always died to a Shelly
---
We will have a quick maintenance break to apply the update, and then it's GO TIME!
---
I dont care man there are no naked pics man...
---
New El Primo is here
---
Woah. Thanks Coach Cory!!

nice

Yea it‚Äôs not hard once you have them all maxed you just save boxes.
---
Geez. I though it was my phone. Thank you SPC
---
Great QOL change to give the more accurate percentages
---
Opened 79 and got nothing
---
Lol it‚Äôs makes no difference to the chances, it‚Äôs just a visual change I don‚Äôt get why ppl are over reacting
---
I didn‚Äôt think he was available until Friday 20th? According to the update details on the AppStore
---
Gone, reduced to atoms
---
Because bibi is an epic brawler
---
At least your % raised because you had no more brawlers to get (and I guess you still opened a lot of boxes since getting all 3, to max them and get the new star powers)
---
My % has been raising while I still had a brawler to get xD it was 0.0092 above mythic before update
---
Wow, it does say that
---
Yes very fun
---
Just got 91 lol
---
I'd tag this with BUG as well as NEWS if I could.
---
MAGICIAN REDDO
---
same here
---
Btw i bought pam and bibi
---
I was wondering the same... because in the App Store is written from the 20th :/
---
voice of me(leon):just a rumor?
---
He does have a line that says "i want my mommy!" He's literally just a big sweet teddy bear
---
With the star powers too holy damn.
---
Maybe some of those 5 were supposed to be in the shop for you so you didn‚Äôt see any

Have they fixed Club mail?
---
My and some members (VP) game crashes when we try to send a club mail.
---
Is it really that hard to understand?
---
How many Epics are you missing? 0
---
What is the chance that right now you open a box and get another epic? Literally 0%
---
And what does it says? 0%
---
If they add a new epic, it will display your actual chance of getting it... and as soon as you get it, it will get back to 0% again
---
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a glitch, it‚Äôs bc you have no other brawlers left to unlock
---
Siege would have been broken else. No need the robot only sandy super...!
---
Yea
---
Saw the 700 gems and cried, managed to snag him after just 40ish boxes
---
ok are u p2w or f2p because i have been f2p and im at 10k with 25 brawlers which is considered lucky but u have 27 brawler at 6k .if you are f2p u shud be grateful but if ur p2w just ignore me

and in Brawl Stars &gt;!probably not!&lt;
---
Yeah but 2.5k for a recolour of a free skin sounds kinda expensive
---
When did you make chances display work properly? Was it this update? I don't see it at changes list...
---
Restart the game. Worked for me.
---
Fuckin kurvo, stupid freak
---
Lmao in your last post you almost have 100 gems less, which was posted 10 mins earlier. Nice buying gems dude!
---
üòÇ Thanks for the reply, I am very impatient
---
I got to 150 by the strangest glitch happened. I managed to screen record and edit it too. Check it out on my posts
---
Im at 8k only leon my chane is .7562 help me!!!!
---
Where does it say in the patch notes that he‚Äôll be released Friday? I just opened up all 130 boxes I saved up and didn‚Äôt get him...
---
Check my account and see all my other posts you will see that god himself touched me and gave me luck
---
:Insert Gru meme:
---
It‚Äôs not new
---
I hate u, i'm at 13k with no legendaries
---
I got to 150 power cubes but the strangest glitch happened. I managed to screen record and edit it too. Check it out on my posts
---
F
---
By 'no longer supporting x86 android devices' What do you mean? Brawl stars crashes 3 seconds after opening the app with the new update on my Galaxy S8+. Can you fix this glitch or is my device not supported anymore?
---
Ok only use gems on discount token doublers save every other gem skins are cool but they dont help with progress
---
i mean it has different attack animation and different model. 2.5k is equivalent of 80 gems  ( touchdown bull is 80 gems and linebacker is 2.5k). so its quite reasonable.  pure recolors are the ones worth 30 gems/500 star points.
---
Wait people have the sixth game mode slot?
---
It might get a new vfx in the future. No wonder they put DK Jessie on sale just days before Summer Jessie gets a new vfx lol.
---
What
---
Oh, thanks .
---
(It's a great thing you reported this)
---
Thanks LEON.
---
No. Gold is good
---
Wat
---
I almost hit 170 too, its the only funny way of playing with bots
---
Check my account and all my other posts you will see my progress and incredible luck but i did save 300 boxes that helped me out
---
Lol. U expected it to cost 30 gems??
---
Im vem broke i never get any
---
isnt he gonna be like 400 gems?
---
Habalabrabaaaa
---
Nothing changed.
---
you are waiting for other 3 , you can wait for this one too. believe in yourself.
---
There are people with way more trophies than you without any legendaries
---
I wish you lots of luck
---
But fuckin still my brother is at 1.5k and has all three before update
---
With this there are three, buy Leon + Shark Leon
---
That's cute
---
Finally
---
Yes I do, it was 0.246% and Sandy was the only brawler I was missing.
---
Yeah supercell likes to give legendaries to low trophy accounts.
---
439 or something, can't remember the price, but the one with discount because of brawler release
---
How old is your phone? God damn, haven't seen a picture like that since 2015
---
It was sarcasm..
---
Ok I get it. You took a step back. Seems logical. Congrats my dude.
---
But isn't the purpose of the game meant to let everyone have fun with the game? I think that if you lack 4 legendary and you actually manage to grind up to 15,000 Star Points you deserve to be rewarded with a Legendary Brawler if you are willing to sacrifice 15,000 Star Points for it. In fact, according to the ratio I've given, 15,000 Star Points is in fact even more expensive than normal.
---
Again i save gems from free boxes i dont buy skins hater lol i saved 300 boxes i opened like 260 and i got tons of star powers gems gold lmao
---
What's the point in changing the rocket priority in robo rumble? I can't imagine how it's gonna be when the boss goes on a rocketing spree..
---
Yep, the description in the App Store is a bit outdated. Sandy is available now!
---
I wish you luck
---
60 what. 60 WHAT!
---
I got leon at 7k
---
catches low  health brawlers off guard.  any brawler that can be 3 shotted has no chance of counterplay.
---
Removed - Your post is too short, please expand on your title.
---
tf are you trying to say ?
---
I thought It said famboy
---
I‚Äôm at 14k trophies and I‚Äôd take it
---
you know what a battle pass is right? it different compare to a trophy road lmao
---
Poco: That sucks
---
SAXY
---
Wtf did Carl ever do to you guys, also whats the point of nerfing piper again?
---
There's still a lag between the shadow and the rocket...
---
Did they? I tough sandy was available now when I checked but I‚Äôm not sure because for some reason I remember seeing something about September 20 but I‚Äôm not sure what that was about since I can‚Äôt see it again
---
the worst balance change ever why make ca 
---
rl useless and other starpwer doesnt even need do a nerf
---
Lol I love this parody. There are posts on here that are actually serious about this kind of stuff. And they end up getting like 9 million upvotes.
---
I get where you are coming from, but it‚Äôs $50+ for a single legendary brawler. Imagine paying that much for a single character.
---
WOOSH
---
first world problems
---
Yep I‚Äôm 13k with only Leon and there are a lot of people who might not have any legends above the 10k
---
well... yes, but new rare/s.rare/mythic will coming to brawl stars (i don't have pam,crow,spike and now sandy)
---
I assume that when that happens, the chances will rise back up again
---
I wasn't the only one who thought Sandy would be a girl right?
---
Your post has been removed, make sure to use the body of a post to elaborate on the title.
---
that is what i meant by rare . ok im going to stop replying. have a nice day
---
I agree. This is my favorite game mode and they potentially ruined it for me. What do they expect characters like Pam, bull, etc... to do? They‚Äôre already getting punched and shot missles at, how are they suppose to avoid the rockets too? When I‚Äôve been Pam in the past on insane 3 and above, if I have the rockets on me while being closest to the boss it‚Äôs always instant death. Guess supercells tryna change the meta :/
---
Assuming you have 0.1 percent change to get legendary. Meaning 0.001 probability to get it in a box.
---
You have 823 boxes assuming you have 1 mega box in trophy Road.
---
Probability you won't get sandy = (1-0.001)^823 = 0.44
---
Probability you'll get sandy is 0.56
---
What the frick just happened
---
Ryan said they are working on a fix
---
Carl Johnson isn‚Äôt a nerd
---
and I don't have a single legendary and I have 8500 trophies oof
---
It was said you would destroy TikTok, not join them!
---
Check all my account posts you'll be shocked
---
I got my first legendary in 18k so don't give up haha..
---
Plays clip from TAKEN
---
"GOOD LUCK"
---
8-Bit Rank 20 power 1 was done first at Aug 30 üíÄ
---
Exactly, it just got a whole lot easier for a ranged brawler to take out the bot from a distance!
---
tHeY BuFFeD rOsA :Q
---
Lol it‚Äôs just a funny thing that happened- I know supercell matchmaking can be weird
---
8bit Sandy?
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
*sees Ryan*
---
Fangirl mode- activated
---
Just because of sandy ,Leon get a nerf in siege how wonderful.
---
all the youtubers are like this
---
I just maxed my Shelly 2 weeks ago and I got Bandaid from a big box but now it's trash
---
Realized my mistake minutes later üòÇ
---
"users are decreasing"
---
I'd like to see your source on this
---
Dang you coach cory thanks for making Bibi and piper's starpower useless
---
Where is it said this?
---
Yeah that seems fair
---
What no 
---
But 300 is not good 1000-1500 ok
---
Same here when i get 156 Power cubes
---
Did you get it from boxes?
---
the one that is a stupid here is you, Sandy is a unisex name, and he is a boy, stop crying
---
now everyone will use piper cause the rockets will not target her from far or maybe rico
---
Frikk, is should have known
---
I know how you feel, I had the same problem. Hang in tight and you'll get your brawler. Got my first legendary a month ago, I am currently at 12k
---
Wow that girl so pretty üòç
---
You lucky bastard
---
Honestly though I was up at 3 am when I got the update and no there was no maintenance break
---
I was clearly not getting any of them from the 2 mega boxes I saved from trophy road :/
---
Wtf kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
---
I need to push Colt to 750.
---
On 3v3 and duo SD maps, I always get matched with completely new players (1k-5k trophies), and on solo SD it's teaming everywhere.
---
Will miss ya
---
*el rudo evil laugh
---
My friend did
---
Well unfortunately you might just have to wait 2 hours until a new map comes up and let people (like me) who‚Äôs tryna push bull have a go
---
That would be really useful
---
I know bibi is top tier with her Speed boost but the nerf seem like a little too hard
---
Tick receives buff? This is the most stupid balance ever!
---
She is trash anyways
---
Fr they had Leon and his skin for 429 gems I was planning on buying sandy but I'm not aboutta drop almost 50$ to get him especially when I won't get any points with him
---
It says in the update video that sandy is a boy, and refers to him as a he. Lmao either way it wouldn‚Äôt be promoting anything, I think you read way too much into incorrect thingsüòÇ
---
I hate the Nl brawlstars player
---
Spoken like a true comrade
---
i think you misunderstood me. i have 15k now and 26 brawlers. i was talking about how many brawlers i had when i was at 9k
---
Hey hey hey

That's my gf
---
Smoldering Boulders.
---
Xd
---
Somebody didn‚Äôt get Sandy. It‚Äôs ok. Nice post.
---
this isnt even a joke anymore, overused

Stop complaining they gave us 2 free brawlers in a row

Exactly! Hopefully they add a special offer soon....

Wait, you still won?

Yea, seems so

yea i was just tryin out diff brawlers on that mode lmao

Are you referring to the amazing matchmaking?
---
I don't think we need it. Players with the highest bounty stars above their head will just feed the ones with the lowest points to get rid of their high bounty and not give the points to the closer opponents in the rankings.
---
He is

I know Sandy is available to purchase in the shop. I am wondering if I should wait until Friday to open up the boxes I have saved up.

nice Animation. which program do you use for cutting and editing?

the reason is the health value went over 65535 which makes it went over the 2^(15) \-1 interger limit

Why does barley need a buff, hes been a top 10 brawler for the longest time now.

carl is the nerd of the rocks, others are nerds of studying

#THIS IS REQUIEM

Its a curse

I have crow and spike but that‚Äôs it, need leon and sandy‚Äîbtw I‚Äôm at 14600 trophies rn‚Äîso those legies are a must lol
---
To get this statistic's sheet first go to shop then click on a box(either mega or large) and clicked the blue i in the top left corner.
---
#yay woohoo
---
It sure is, but it's still money for stuff that was mostly free.
---
Piper with like 10 reload cubes and snappy sniping.
---
It was nice meeting u el rudo bastard üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
---
Too complex
---
r/theydidthemath
---
Also I think star power statistic's are new before my star power chances never changed.
---
??
---
Thats probaly just skill
---
It's a chance of player with less stars take the 1st place or a better position
---
Bruh these are some Frank-sized facts
---
That's really good! I love it!
---
i was one of the first persons to reveal it
---
He cool
---
Thats normal
---
*THAT GUY*
---
Two down votes who the fuck did this
---
6
---
tbh the main problem with him was his starpower
---
since he can't run away he's gonna get killed very easily since it hardly dodges or hit (especially something like brock, piper or gene) and now his starpower doesn't let him do the thing in showdown where you kill yourself with a freaking 3x3 square of safe zone so you can instakill the other taking no damage or something like this against safe or IKE
---
but that would give you an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe position you need to reach
---
Well then fuck off
---
Tara should have said: it‚Äôs time to bring you in the brawl.
---
I have the same idea but just the stars, not the brawlers so the game will be fair
---
This post sucks
---
in android the same text but without the date, if anyone can confirm its unlockeable ???
---
Whoa! The guys who drew Boblin! Hi!
---
This is definitely
---
a ckickbait
---
Although I can see why you would think that, this is just a lucky game. I have dropped almost 200 trophies in a hour and wanted to see what I was doing wrong that day, although I‚Äôm slowly regaining those trophies
---
Lucky you!
---
SAME PLZ FIX IT SUPERCELL
---
It would be nice to know your own position and maybe how many points the leader has without actually telling you who the leader is. This will give you some idea how many more points you should get to catch up.
---
They wouldn't know why Leon can't be seen, but sandstorm can.
---
It's gambling of your tickets what if get a Mortis on feast or fame or what ever that maps name is
---
Now they have to update poco‚Äôs!
---
Is that out of a box? It says she can‚Äôt be unlocked in boxes yet...
---
Oh ok
---
Eh ma almeno tu hai trovato il leggendario, io no xD
---
WHAAT
---
[r/itsatrap](r/subsyoufellfor)
---
You don't play Tuber Simulator?
---
Bold of you to assume I have any friends
---
Basically a block button
---
Exactly, that map needs to go once and for all, it only encourages camping and picking low skill based brawlers, it‚Äôs a shelly nightmare there.
---
Rip boss fight
---
What glitch. Teach meh
---
I think we will need another small balance changes since there are some unnecessary nerfs (bandaid especially) and some fixes in some nerfs so they aren‚Äôt too much (Carl) and in general other small things that will happen with Sandy
---
I got Leon and Sandy on my mini today after opening like 70 boxes. Also got Sandy on my main within 10 boxes. This made me feel like they have increased the chances of legendary brawlers with this update.
---
If you submit bad playing experience the player would not receive a warning but you would not be matched with them again.
---
Don't forget the Humor flair
---
They always find something
---
Leon wasn't even an S tier in siege, he doesn't deserve this nerf, just let the kid have this one atleast. Sandy can attack without breaking his invisibility in other modes, leon should have his own unique trick too
---
So you gemmed apparently and cba gemmed him to entertain you guys but at least he isn‚Äôt as mean as someone (again)
---
[r/wefightemojiusers](r/subsyoufellfor)
---
I don't think you understand the reason of this video. The problem is not having a better brawler for the map or not. It is about being spawnkilled.
---
Supercell already took actions to reduce the RNG in the game, because your skills and strategy matter more than your luck. In this map, you get spawnkilled if you spawn on the wrong location, and that is the problem.
---
These are incredible and I would buy all 4 of them so fast. Hopefully Supercell is smart and knows that there is a big market out there for Halloween-themed skins. It's my favorite holiday by a mile and I love everything associated with it. Great work, have an upvote
---
Oh, so you just need to get tokens, don't play if you don't have tokens, i was in the situation i had to play only for tokens, then they released the new trophy sistem, lmao i feel so mad for every og that played for a lot of time with +2 at 900
---
I am not complaining, this is just a joke lmao, so no you
---
Also, how many other people have you've seen done this kind of post? I want to know
---
[r/wefightemojiusers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SubsYouFellFor/)
---
How am I being mean
---
It would stop matching you with that player again just like a block but if you reported them for teaming or helping the opposite team and then they got reported again it could result in a ban for them.
---
Eh ma io vedi che sono quasi maxato con tutti i brawler, mi mancano solo le monete üòë
---
those are almost 1k brawl boxes, i swear if you don't get it
---
That old brawl stars ad had someone voicing spike. He sounds like a black dude with a deep voice
---
So, in takedown if you collect about 150 power cubes, the game goes nuts then makes you crash.
---
No
---
The point is to not have teaming while still giving you an idea of how you stack up against the other  players. This leaderboard promotes teaming against players with more stars.
---
And.... he got himself nerfed against siege IKE
---
From your reply and speaking like a jerk
---
What about if I quake?
---
Spoiler Alert:
---
I didn‚Äôt get him...
---
How are they mean!?  Are you up at salty that you can't spend money on the game?
---
Uhm the mode just came out? Ofc everyone is playing it. Wait a few weeks and try again...
---
But if you had a better brawler for the map you could have stood a chance. Also you can have opportunities to do the same thing to other players.  
---
All that said, this map is just straight trash. No way I am playing more after I get the star token on it.
---
I didn‚Äôt say they were mean I am talking about you
---
I would buy the offer if it wasn‚Äôt 700 gems, at least my legendary odds are kinda high with 0.12%
---
So basically you're the boss now
---
Crow with 10 speed cubes
---
very true lmao
---
lot easier to get trophies nowadays. When the new trophy system came I was like at 5k I think? after that I started going up in trophies waaaaaayyyy quicker
---
and now that sandy is here there are people with 30k trophies already, just madness
---
IKE can now see leon when he's invisible, boi got nerfed again. Called it!
---
And I ain‚Äôt salty just pointing out a fact
---
holy fuck, that's like 2.5 times what you would have needed for the chances to be 100%  feels bad, ***GL GETTING THEM BOTH LMAO***
---
lmao a poco
---
oh i ment nerfed sandy 8D8D8D
---
Horrible redesign
---
OG is the well known brawl stars player back then. idk why he never pushes anymore
---
I was ready to spend 20 even 30 bucks, since I only use my cash back from my credit card to fund my brawl stars.  But 40 I rather go out and eat
---
Trust me I have a million other things I'd rather spend $50 on then a brawler on a mobile game
---
But spawn trapping
---
Guys.... I'm shaking. I have chills and need to go to the hospital
---
I play bravl seniors can you be a sorry gift !?
---
Thicco agrees
---
Who thought that these are good game modes?? There could have been so many better ones üò≠
---
but u can do the darryl glitch
---
I wouldn't be surprised
---
Supercell,please add brawler lores back.With new brawlers added,we would like to know their story.
---
(Sorry for bad english)
---
Wow look at this idiot here, this has been said many many times. Supercell approved teaming as a strategy since the game launched. 
---
PS: No one cares if you quit or not.
---
Vabbe buon game
---
What the..
---
And Cairo stienmen
---
I need to push Colt, not shotgun brawlers.
---
Why would you repost a meme from today?
---
I got Sandy from the 7 box
---
And it was to fast i didnt have to suffer, it feels weird
---
If you win enough you can üòõ
---
70 for you? It's literally 40 bucks. 20 for the 360 gems, 2 ten dollar ones 170.
---
source? haha
---
he did it
---
Completely agree,especially coiled snake.
---
700 Gems is fucking cheap, but have fun trying to get him from boxes :)
---
Yeah, if you want something complex go play League, Smite, etc.
---
It would be good if it just told you personally what position you where in 1st to 10th but didn‚Äôt tell you any other players positions instead of the little messages but i‚Äôve noticed it says you need more stars around 8-10th your doing okay 5th to 7th your doing well keep it up 2nd to 4th and then your in the lead when your 1st but it would be better if it just told you your actual position.
---
Just tired of people at 1.4k trophies going "omg I don't win every game I play!! This sucks!!." 
---
If however someone did some research and realised that you can only gain trophies by coming first place and you lost trophies at second place I think you'd have a fairer argument.
---
THANK YOU ! it was making me insane
---
Instead of nerfing the time, I feel they should add a ‚Äúblinking‚Äù effect, where they appear every two seconds or so, will that be more practical or better in any way?
---
literally i swear
---
Nerf tick his range is ridiculous
---
Bruh you can score own goals in soccer so of course they would have them
---
Me at 10.5k trophies not having a single legendary or mythic. \*sigh\*
---
i posted it hours before you
---
I am at 12000 no legendary
---
It show definitely show exactly what place you're in and maybe how many stars the leader has ( not who's the leader though)
---
How you‚Äôre doing compared to others
---
But Poco is more energetic than Sans
---
That fade out look makes him more like a zombie than a pirate ü§£

Do u have mythics and what is ur legendary chance?
---
Genius
---
5* but yeah
---
SHARKKKKKK

the point of datamining an update is to see what's in the work for the next few updates
---
I have all mythics but i dont have bibi piper and all legendaries my chance is 0.0911
---
Of flipaclip?
---
There's so much wrong with this. "Computer engineer" is not a job and no one in the field would say that. Also to be an engineer in the IT field you have to actually be educated, and people that are educated don't type shit like "cuz" and all the other hilarious spelling mistakes you made. You're probably in high school at most and have no clue what you're talking about, so sit down kiddo.
---
Like RoboKid said, the point of the yellow card is to still punish you for walking it in(since normally that would've been a goal for the other team) but still give you a chance to play the game and make up for your mistakes without outright banning you for an honest mistake.

Yes, now she actually has teeth

My sandy is power 9. Spent no gems. Got him on my 4th of 250ish saved boxes.
---
I just didn't needed to. My goal from the start is to get all my brawlers to 500, and there's no need to upgrade then to get to 500. You can get to 500 with everyone at level 1. All i care is saving boxes and unlock new brawlers
---
Not necessary and overly complicated. Literally all we need is a reporting mechanic.

This is old, everybody knows about this.

and takedown too

bruh

How I don‚Äôt even see the game mode for this

Oh that's nice, basically screeching solo passed form good offensive option for Poco to useless, great. And Piper's Sniping was fine at .4 .  
---
"We listen to the community"  
---
What community exactly, skrubs who whine after getting wrecked by someone proficient with Poco or Piper? Please. At least Blizzard had the dignity to tell those kind of people to just git gud when they were whining to nerf Bastion into the ground

bull is sad about his friend corpsing for no reason

ya, it removes watermark and gets you some more features. I think you should, your pretty good at this
---
Bruh wrong sub reddit, post it on r/choosingbeggars
---
Downvoted
---
Same goes for Poco and Piper. All the people complaining about them being low tier then cry about them being op when they get the buff needed to be more competitive.  
---
Screeching solo passed form good offensive option for Poco to completely useless, great. And Piper's Sniping was fine at .4 . Ridiculous.
---
Same luck ahahaüéâüî•

That's what im asking.. I have all brawlers, but what is going to happen with my % legendary if a new brawler gets released
---
Island invasion is still a shit map outside of Showdown
---
In the top right corner from brawl stars reddit is an option
---
So long and goodnight
---
Ok no proplem its my fault
---
good skins is back on the menu again boys
---
how do you calculate chance
---
It‚Äôs time to die
---
Adios Amigos
---
Was that on this update? Cuz It was annoying as hell yesterday lol
---
Stop pls
---
I only do this with 1 ammo so I reload in time for it to not matter. also only after the idiot fails a trick shot on an easy goal and then the other team comes down and scores
---
Is a guy with a male voice
---
Who was this person
---
Okay Good Luck for the next , for me I open 260 box to get him but still have my 41 Big Box and 2 Mega Box
---
F man i opened up 265 boxes and 16 big boxes and NOTHING but sitll for you i give a F
---
Yeah .game Update today, and that bug was fixed 
---
Already tested that
---
If you tap on the mega/large box in the shop and hit the info button in the top left corner of the buy icon, you should be able to view your chances.
---
gedi, once again never ceases to amaze
---
You can gey for free, if you have Android, btw
---
Spike at 3k i remember i hope i get sandy at 13k i now have like 70 boxes
---
It was an old cancer map, that people complained until it got removed, now it's back ...
---
Penny with 9 power cubes and dmg elixir? Shelly doesnt even flinch. BOOMBOOM gone.
---
True. Darryl is very broken right now.
---
Even shooting at an enemy, depending on the angle, the bullets go through the enemy without hitting him.
---
Poco's screeting solo too
---
Hmm, seems like a bug
---
I don‚Äôt know where the heck you get your ideas but each of them are amazing
---
Damn son
---
It looks like someone disturbed his slumber. Great work as always Gedi-Kor.
---
LOL
---
Thank you very much
---
My man gedikor
---
Wow
---
supercell Supercell this new brawler is cool but his last one is unbalanced You guys could fix it or rock it a little bit and you could give me some more luck to win legendary brawlers I just got one that I bought to please
---
Why are u creative?
---
Need upvote u for pro primo skills
---
I agree. I have enjoyed getting my brawlers to 500, then on to 550, but it's getting a little repetitive. Especially since they took away the end of season rewards, it's just so hard to progress at that point in the game without spending money. I have been free to play since December, but I got sick of grinding with no progression and gave in and bought Spike during the summer sale with the mecha skin. Right after that, I unlocked Leon, so I got stoked and played a ton. Now I haven't gotten star powers in well over a month, and don't expect to get a new brawler any time soon. It's just kinda slow at this point.
---
I‚Äôll be better if it tells you what position you‚Äôre in and not show any names
---
Bruh i have spike and leon but no mythics
---
Why are they nerfing snappy sniping AGAIN. Also I hate carls nerf
---
Yes.
---
Or spawnkillers
---
best primo here
---
Yeah I hope that too! In the meantime I can't look how much my % legendary is increasing
---
Goodbye Brawl Stars. Thanks Supercell.
---
I can't play anymore because your team made my device not supported anymore.
---
I'm done with this game.
---
This is a very nice skin, as always! Keep up the good work u/GEDI-KOR!
---
Wow Yamada rank 35 primo can‚Äôt counter your rank 20 primo
---
me at 600+ currently at 7th place: loses 2 trophies
---
**yOu aRe dOiNg oK**
---
I got Crow at about 1.5k thanks to a weird glitch in the shop.
---
Wait for a discount.
---
r/unpopularopinion
---
Good idea. But if I had to report every randoms i play with, after 6 months, there wouldn't be many people that i can match with and i would have to wait an eternity to play 1 match.
---
Dude say sike right now. Right FUCKING NOW.
---
Holy. Mine is 0.0335 lmao
---
I am a $upercell fan with just enough gems for skins time to time

Supercel I came here to give you a suggestion to improve bralw stars you could put that function in bralw stars before launching globally for example: I open a box there comes nothing there I watch a video to double my rewards ... I hope that listen to my comment if possible put this function in the next update thanks for the attention
---
And a great day
---
Woooow, I Don't Know How You Make These "Legendary" Art.
---
P.S Sandy Just Came In The Legendary Gang...
---
It's went x4 better , Thank you supercell
---
I‚Äôll take that as a compliment, because Kirby is adorable
---
This is literally a complaint
---
This*
---
Well, I did. I found some interesting stuff. But I'm too lazy to write a post. You can do a datamine yourself tho. It's easy.
---
Amazing. His super then can be called blizzard
---
OP is right. When I'm fighting with someone, which can take quite some time, and see that someone else is pinching me, and if i don't see any option to get out alive, i let myself killed by the one second one, so the first one who tried to attack me for so long doesn't get the points.
---
And that's where it's unfair, he worked to kill me but got nothing.
---
A system where the one who deals the most damage is rewarded seems more fair.
---
What about El Primo‚Äôs meteor rush star power nerf? IMO that was his only good star power and if they wanted to make people use his other star power they should just completely rework it
---
I can't change your mind...
---
I don't know if you have a #mind
---
Really wished supercell called you to work with them
---
Yeah it's actully high And that happened cuz of 2 reasons 
---
1 - They added new legendary
---
2 - They fixed the bug that even if you finishied all the brawlers form the raitry it still takes some of your brawlers chance
---
Now that i used my brain a bit more i realized the title might be a little misleading, sorry for that,l. As you see in the video, english is not my first language.
---
Yeah, Island Invasion is the best Lonestar map.
---
Okay
---
Wait can you already open it?  I thought not til Friday
---
Amazing
---
I'm at 13.5k and no legendary
---
you forgot 1 , jessie !
---
Thanks man
---
Lol, I‚Äôm going to try it now!
---
Still,that's bad
---
Fisherman Vs Gene Pls
---
I trust u
---
So you can already unlock her?  App Store says she‚Äôs available on Friday
---
Make a Piper jumping in a bush with Bulls.
---
That‚Äôs right
---
Me too
---
üòÇ bye
---
When you op 9 big and 87 normal boxes and get nothing not even a star power üò≠üò≠üò≠
---
True
---
Cool thanks for the vid. Glad to know sandy can be unlocked in boxes!
---
The way he looks in the game
---
It's on Reddit, it's just dani saying why they don't have release dates
---
Nah 2k heath was Trash
---
Im at 10k missing frank, pam, bibi, gene, leon, crow and sandy
---
I agree that the nerf is completely unneeded, although she is still a very good brawler nonetheless
---
Really sad, bro, for Bibi, I opened 150 Brawl Boxes and 13 Big boxes, and the same thing happens to me ;(
---
So.... what I just drew... but with piper instead of crow.....?
---
Heck yes, at least it should say "You are the #number" and not the current messages
---
Oops.
---
You just need to know how to use her properly
---
I have no money
---
Also im 12!
---
Nice one
---
Shelly needs a huge nerf
---
U got all the legendaries but no mythics? Feels bad man
---
Literally I get 300 trophies in an hour, is op and fun
---
For me it felt good getting him
---
I want Sandy!
---
It is definitely not fun for the opponents thoughüòÇ
---
I also have all the brawlers. But not sandy. Congrats!
---
Trophies? I‚Äôm just curios

I was ready for you to say somewhere below 1,000 and I was about to be pissed

What is like to see 8-bit‚Äôs star power for the first time. 
---
*Kills 8 bit easily*
---
* 8-bit respawns* 
---
(Wtf) 
---
*flees..gets gunned down anyway* 
---
...50 games later. Still haven‚Äôt learn my lessons.
---
I don‚Äôt have them all, I need the other Legendaries
---
Should be a modifier
---
....okay
---
Okay you‚Äôve got it worse
---
It's ok but I personally think the old El rudo primo looks better
---
I having star power and crow today
---
but a want Sandy 
---
Sorry for my English
---
I guess?
---
Yeah because the current system is too vague. If i‚Äôm in the ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre doing okay‚Äù range i could either gain 2 trophies or lose 2, and i have no idea which. I don‚Äôt need to know other people‚Äôs placements, i just want to know mine so i know whether it‚Äôs safe to play aggressively or whether i should maybe play a bit more conservatively. That could be the difference between gaining or losing trophies if i‚Äôm in that middle range.
---
I have seen this idea before
---
Point considered. I still prefer ambush
---
Her star power.... It's useless like nerf
---
30 and 80, now 80 and 150
---
Buy and refund ez
---
It was made by me, you can check PixelCrux and Reddit
---
My life story in a single post
---
Much needed
---
What is wrong?
---
most :)
---
It's not that the spawns are bad,it's that they are way too close to each other. Also,why bones at the entrace of each spawn point? It servers no purpose but to waste an ammo.
---
And yes,the original itself is a bad map for Lone Star,as you said. Way too many campers and tanks.
---
That's bad
---
As a sleepwalker, I approve of this.
---
Who the hell would want that if you can get it for free
---
*Ahem 9 years olds*
---
beautiful now I want it :/
---
His hand is going trough His feest i can see and otherwise i‚Äôm blindü§£
---
WHAT THE HAPPENING?!
---
Literally me rn
---
I don't think it's a good idea in lone star bcs people can target the first one and that will ruin the game
---
It‚Äôs like a solo version but different. I get to play with my friends privately. Much more fun!
---
Supercell do a really good job reworking El Primo, adding custom animations to the skins so, I think is a good deal
---
Hey, maybe it's not cannon but it can be fannon.
---
my pc is broken can i in phone ?
---
Worst map they could have picked for the first time the game mode is out
---
Of course he is called Mohammad, this is fine
---
Yes, but maybe we can convince them to make it cannon
---
Here before the reposters stole this
---
I know
---
please dont buy
---
Maybe a new modifier
---
I opened 74 boxes (52 small, 4 Big and 1 Megabox) and I didn't even get Mortis :c
---
Damn I got bullied hard, 120 downvotes...
---
Surprised, huh?
---
Carl is my name, Cringe lines are my game
---
hi supercell please increase my chance i love this game the new update is really cool
---
I know that you made, but i ment the idea
---
'Aight let's do that
---
Haha this made me laugh
---
Ok, tell me why every single other legendary costs 550 gems, and then theres Sandy holy shit
---
How about not showing the 1st player but showing the remaining
---
What?
---
i love island isvasion wat u mean boi
---
Wow this is genius Gedi! Nice piece of work!
---
I did take inspiration from a few other maps, but they were not similar enough for me to credit them. the only idea i took was the island theme
---
He does it again! Great work Gedi-Kor!
---
Dumb skin
---
Shocky rocks
---
Now don't be greedy!!
---
Sorry father üòîüëç
---
It's likely just an abnormally tall male and a somewhat below average female. 7' vs 5' is a large difference. You can see how close the guy's head is to the ceiling, it would be claustrophobic for normal people.
---
As an italian i feel very offended
---
if it's 700 gems it'd best be OP at first
---

Nobody cares tbh

I accidentally opened a big box and got crow on July 6th
---
I just got spike :) 3 to go
---
7, 8, 9. There is no windows 9
---
r/cursedbrawlstars
---
I thought they said she won't be in boxes until Friday.
---
Second place is still winning
---
What? Their new skins are really detailed and nice (except some of the star skins but that's on purpose because they're recolors). I don't see why they shouldnt do these, a ghost leon or pumpkin spike aren't that detailed and still look perfect for 80 gems skins.
---
Np
---
I was kidding bro... It will get some fame, just have patience for now!!
---
thanks!
---
I just opened them because my chances were so slim it wasn‚Äôt worth worrying about.
---
No people would get targeted
---
What is the luck system rework? Only change I noticed was they show the true percentages for what you can get once a category is empty (0).
---
Gl to you too my guy hope you get him real soon
---
_cries in nerdy robot_
---
Only 90s kids know the 20gem one
---
150 I think
---
why do people think sandy is tara and gene's son? this makes no sense
---
Oh ok tutto apposto
---
S√≥ faz o que pede
---
You‚Äôre still my father
---
I got to 95 with Bibi. It‚Äôs easy if you use her first star power and just run around the out skirts of the map picking up cubes and killing brawlers along the way, but make sure to completely ignore the boss so that you have more time to get as many power cubes as possible
---
Them compliment teamers too.
---
Well i like the green bushes better :/
---
I just wish I knew how many stars other people have, I don‚Äôt need to know their brawler or their name but just how much I need to beat
---
Oh boo hoo they nerfed op star powers
---
Yay can't wait brawl talk looked sick
---
Good drawing but not original
---
Wow. Great jobüëå
---
True i pushed almost 150 trophies
---
Piper was also balanced, and so was screeching solo.
---
They really fucked shit up.
---
you are producing way too much light for le to believe you are a creature of the night
---
Summary of the game mode
---
Also because of [Sandman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandman)
---
J√° fiz e n deu certo,aparece a mesma coisa,o mais engra√ßado √© q eu instalei pela play store!
---
The Mortis dashed out of the super before he got stunned
---
Ooh, good art!
---
shit memetages are infecting brawlstars too?
---
Instead of showing the brawler icon maybe they should put a question mark or something? So that we know where we rank and how many stars other people have, but just not who has them. This way we can know how we're doing without the incentive to team
---
Was worth a shot I guess
---
(Forgive me for bluestacks btw)
---
Fortnite bad brawl good
---
We know
---
*snowy*
---
Yeah but where did he say that
---
Try 256
---
Im sorry but there was one guy Who didnt know
---
where do we hide the body
---
What about match list wtf?
---
Yep it triggers me hard
---
I did.
---
i thought i was unlucky until i saw your comment xD i'm at 12k with 22 brawlers
---
Someone downvoted my post  
---
not epic gamer moment
---
They‚Äôre hardly gonna make it count towards the 3v3 wins because it‚Äôs not 3v3
---
No they didnr
---
Holy spaghetti
---
And confuses everyone by saying ‚ÄúSandStorm!‚Äù
---
It was always 34
---
Nah i know they wont. Make another acheivement count in regards to free for all. Trophy road needs to be updated anyway
---
I don't know üòÇ
---
yeah is your laptop a new generation computer ? cause i have an OLD desktop but brawl stars was working fine before the update !
---
Unless you have an android version that isn‚Äôt supported anymore I would make sure you have internet in other apps.   This usually happens to me when I‚Äôm connected to WiFi but the internet stopped working.  If you can get onto google and search things but still have the issue try redownloading the app
---
sad luck ?? lol wtf. i had 18 brawlers when i was at 9k
---
Very very true
---
Yeah but if a player scores against themselves on purpose they usually don‚Äôt get invited to the same team again

I know. And he outspeeds you anyway, which is annoying. The only way primo beats crow is by using bushes and cover to ambush, or using his super.

How did dou got 600 boxes?

Remodel Pam 1st!

They gave is 2 free brawlers stop complaining

Thank you for the request, comrade.

In game says available in brawl boxes
---
Update after that: Shelly instantly dies in the menu!
---
I like the new rey primo
---
What if you only knew your standing not other people's. That would prob be better.
---
How you got sandy?
---
Where did he steal it from?
---
Laptop is pretty new, but the deskop its a pretty nice one a little bit older (i left at my friend house since i use the laptop, but component wise is better than this, just a bit older)
---
156 cubes
---
Amazing stuff. Why SUPERCELL never use these ideas is one of life's greatest mysteries...
---
Wow, never seen a that high legendary chance, but you still would need to open 250 boxes to get 100% (i know you can get lucky and get him in the next box and you also can get unlucky and open over 300 boxes without him)
---
The 8-bit update smoothed out franks model and walking animation a bit so I‚Äôm thinking another brawler will get a remodel first
---
Bruh...
---
Ah, I see you're a man of culture as well.
---
So you are telling me that there is no hope in my 60 boxes???
---
Don't play it too safe. It's more important to get kills than it is to not die.
---
If your status in the upper right says you're in the lead or you're doing great, it's OK to play a little safer, especially if you have a high bounty. If it says you are doing OK or you need more points, you need to be willing to take some serious risks to get your points up so you aren't toward the end.
---
It's better to sit out of fights until the brawlers are all hurt and then jump in for the kill. Since there are no powerups to grab, don't wait around and let somebody get you in a bad position!
---
High damage brawlers with OK or higher sustainability seem best. Brawlers with good damage but who have a hard time landing the finishing blow are not a good choice as the finishing blow is more important than anything else.
---
Gorzej ci?
---
My point is that someone who has been playing for over a year (not me, just people in general) and still don't have legendaries, see posts like this and think "look at this 5k noob complaining about rng drop rates"
---
It's just perspective man. Don't get upset that you don't have the most prized possessions of the game after only 3 months. I'm not sure if I can stress that enough... you've only been playing 3 months.
---
I still cant get past Insane II üò´
---
Hey, i found out that about 33k healing is the number to glitch poco's healing, don't have a video but somehow before crashing my game i managed to heal leds than It should and was able to heal an enemy Shelly with screeching solo
---
It‚Äôll be added later, just like 8-Bit‚Äôs second one.
---
Vedlo todos!!
---
You just described the new game mode Lonestar.
---
The new game mode feels dead! I know it's not the mode, it's the fucking map! Why supercell??
---
Yeah I agree it‚Äôs a bit frustrating not knowing where you‚Äôre gonna end up. I have a feeling they will tweak the visuals over time!
---
It's still horrible, can't wait to play the real lone star maps
---
I just learned about this kind of glitch, its called a kill-screen. For games like pac man, they are 8 bit, so only stores 2\^8 - 1  = 256 levels in the game. Brawl stars is way higher
---
To recreate the problem, you go to the center of either edge of the map and aim you super about 10¬∞ above the edge of land.
---
And how long has this shit not been nerfed?
---
Im having lag issues after the update
---
Or in pc 64-bit
---
Who's the dude in the background?
---
I reposted my own post because it died in New
---
Yay i got leon :)
---
Yeah? How about fixing the net code.
---
you play shelly on this map, shame
---
Why
---
Yeah but like its not overpowered enough to need a nerf lmao
---
neat
---
Bentimm1 has 1%+
---
Where do i view this?
---
Yeah but I wanted to push mortis
---
Nita had 60 sorry for bad crop
---
Test
---
I got her on the second box I opened... really lucky! God luck to you too guys!
---
Cool, I use Yes for my memes too!
---
Lol rookie numbers I opened 500 to try to get Leon. Didn‚Äôt get anything but eh got sandy on like my 20th box this time around.
---
Yea it was
---
What's so new about this
---
I hate you
---
I have not played island invasion before.
---
Yeah that's why I don't like loan star bc you don't know who's winning
---
I'm trying to get pam and I guess the big box said no
