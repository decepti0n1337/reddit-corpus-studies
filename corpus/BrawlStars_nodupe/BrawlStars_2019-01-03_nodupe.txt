Many people have used it / reposted it various times. It's disappointing the original creator is never giving proper credit.

Sometimes.

I bet I can edit out all of ur watermarks

Actually, spending gold on power points speeds up your progression to having max power points, but you‚Äôll have less gold then. However, you will get more gold from boxes later. It is a trade off, but it‚Äôs not bad.

He would be significantly better than every brawler in puddle splash üëÄ

Bull was the 2nd to last person alive?

Weird flex but ok
---
How did u download this? Can I do it on my computer?
---
If they get you at max range the dynamite explodes pretty quickly as soon as it lands. Also smart dynas save up till they have 3 shots then fire rapidly which makes it easier to land devastating hits.
---
Ye they are
---
It's not that big of a deal but there's definitely situations that having that could decide games and there's definitely people that that factor made them win or lose
---
OOF

I managed to escape üòÅ

Is this a joke

r/woosh
---
Other than the Brock play and arguably another one after that, he played very well. WTH you talking about 
---
I‚Äôll said it once and I‚Äôll keep saying it, Darry either needs an accuracy buff or an HP buff. I would prefer an accuracy buff only because you have to practically stand right next to Brawlers in order for all the pellets to hit which leaves them with just enough HP to finish you off.
---
and yes I was a darryl too, hence 0-0

What are best showdown maps for him?

Always nice to get it lol

No matter what there is an area that is impossible to throw which doesn't make sense to me

Hey, can you help me, I'm deaf so I can't see this post, can you tell it to me in sign language so I can see it?
---
It also allows the bullets to pierce.
---
ü§≠ Forgot about that. Thanks!
---
Barley is really good in heist too
---
If a Frank isn't stupid enough he won't let bull get close enough.
---
I never said Frank will kill in 3 hits. But he out ranges bull and can kite him. The wind up may be large but so is the cone.
---
Hey
---
But this was posted today
---
Did you use the exploit to get that? Having your teammate purposely die over and over? If not that's impressive 
---
Gong hey fat choy! Happy new year to you too. Lol.
---
i think its datamined
---
No way, I think most people would hate this
---
I want also to have friendly mode and ranked mode, so I can play my favourites 500 cups brawlers with my friends or alone. I think that friendly mode should be added (all players in the match should be in friendly mode).
---
Wouldn‚Äôt people spinning in the same tile just defeat the purpose or would there be other restrictions 
---
Happy new year bro!

NO MORE LEGENDARIES!!üò¢üò§

This same topic was brought up recently in another post: https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/abkfhr/this_sub_is_absolute_garbage/?st=JQFV83XC&amp;sh=4a0225c1
---
that crow flair 
---
Thank you for the reply and help but it still seems to not work. 
---
ok so what about it?
---
Why do you normies keep saying mortis needs a buff? He is fine as long as you know how to use him and not rush everyone you see. Just learn how to play him and you‚Äôll see.
---
Yeah but the idea is not making a game only for a few brawlers. I really like the suggestion as an event modifier but not only supers game, it could be a 50-50 or sth like that
---
At least he‚Äôs not just using a broken brawler to pretend he‚Äôs good at the game
---
They should put a sign like RUN AND COVER! Or something like that really captures the attention, because I‚Äôm tired of watching all those primos using the super aiming to a frigging blank space between the 3 enemies and gifting all those gems. The only counter I found is to risk myself more and get all those gems by myself knowing I can really trust myself to hide.
---
Bro where did you get this awesome idea from??
---
Just mentioning it to hopefully pool everyone‚Äôs comments into a single thread. 
---
Ent√£o fechou parceiro por que sou BR tamb√©m xD
---
And I do agree with you that this sub needs some work. 
---
Same. I'm progressing very slowly and am kinda stuck at 8k trophies. Not one legendary brawler. 
---
I get where you‚Äôre coming from, but against good players or aware players, they won‚Äôt just walk into your ult range. They know better than that. The players you got were clearly not very skilled or good.
---
Where?!
---
I‚Äôm sorry to inform YOU but it‚Äôs WAY WAY WAY worse when your teammates are the same trophies with you but you still lose, but then you check their trophies and it‚Äôs like 400. So every brawler they have has like 0 trophies except for that one 400 which is why they‚Äôre absolute garbage.
---
LOL you changed it. Thanks my b.
---
Or a 9 leon match. That‚Äôll go greaaat
---
I‚Äôd say bull and Shelly make up about 30%. Most players play leon.
---
Star power &gt; 2k
---
Yes 
---
Liar! Read the discription 
---
Aaaah thats hot
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure I got 60 before the nerf
---
How about a one week event where players can convert gold into gems. If you convert it into gems and spend all the gems on boxes and get stuck with a lot of gold again then you are out of luck. This would be the best way to compensate for a broken economy.
---
Great star power, but he faced horrible players. Nobody 500+ just moseys into Darryl ult range.
---
And I‚Äôm 100% sure supercell won‚Äôt give you a refund
---
In this situation that person has all the gems
---
I thought everyone knew that too üëÆ
---
üòÇ
---
I mean any close range champ will at least be ok on this map...
---
Thanks for you reply!
---
These offers can be randomized for every player or stay the same. But if you are talking about a individual player, they will have to buy the one that shows up in their shop!
---
And I‚Äôm 100% sure the game is still shit.
---
I‚Äôm pretty confident I know how to play him, I just like to enjoy other events with Mortis without the risk of losing trophies, which is hard because he can hardly help in heist nor the special robot event. And I feel Mortis should live up to his ‚ÄúMythic‚Äù tag.
---
That clutch at the end though!!!!
---
Ggs!!!!!! Your really good, completely changed my outlook on Darryl
---
no
---
Its not a bug, its how the game is played
---
Rip that super into the fart cloud xD
---
How would being  in a bush suffocate you???

my mini has Leon :)

my first account has no legendary xD

The only buff mortis needs is a little recharge buff, that's probably it
---
Unlike of the party
---
Modified Executioner, basically 
---
Recharge as in the main attack of special? Either way I agree with you
---
I can tell you‚Äôre obviously new to the game, which there is nothing wrong with. But it‚Äôs Ricochet‚Äôs bullets are only meant to hit once, other wise with Ricochet‚Äôs range, he‚Äôd be broken. Having the star power adds more skill, as you need to bounce of a wall, then hit the enemy brawler
---
I think that‚Äôs the fault of their system. It‚Äôd make more sense to fix this problem rather than making a new game mode. 
---
so far theyve added...mortis' hat...thats pretty much it
---
Report it to the mods
---
We need a fidget spinner boi in our game
---
I like thousand lakes, but that‚Äôs just because of his super
---
Idk what you mean by 4/3, but assuming you mean four thirds, his bullets would do negative damage xD
---
This is hilarious! Good work mate!

In the dev build Pam was named "Mama J". She is Jessies mom.

#THEY‚ÄôRE IN THE BUSHES MAN!

I love your art style! It looks so cute yet professional at the same time that it blows my mind. Keep it up!
---
P.S. After the Christmas Tree comic, you made Nita my favorite Brawler.
---
That‚Äôs a good point. What would you consider a counter to Colt would be then? 
---
Colt
---
Bye Bye Leon, Pam, Poco. It would really favor the characters with stronger supers with high damage like Colt, while characters like Bull will really suffer. It would literally be all Colts, Rico, Barley, Dyna etc.
---
There are no direct "counters" for ranged brawlers, it depends a lot on the situation, gamemode, brawler you're using. Basically, just play well.
---
The most similar to a counter would be Mortis or Darryl imo. Or another Colt
---
Then leon has like 10bars when he goes invisible
---
My Legendary chance was 0.11... Then I got Mortis and it dropped down.
---
It's not a skill lmao, actually being good at Darryl is a skill 
---
using Leon is not
---
unless it's Leon against Leon I guess
---
I agree. 
---
now this is epic
---
Gg
---
The bushes start speaking bull and it's all over.
---
Her mouth/nose/face isn't feminine enough to me. Maybe hands too, I'm not sure. Besides that it's really good.
---
It's a skin
---
Basically you create a new account called an alt/smurf/mini account, to play with players at lower ranks for the purpose of either destroying noobs, play with kow ranked friends or just starting fresh because high rank is too repetitive
---
The only time when people really stop moving is when they hide in bushes. Maybe add something like if they stay in a bush for longer than 2 consecutive seconds, then they start taking damage.
---
they had a similar one with bots, called ‚Äúpractice‚Äù. They even removed it, so your idea is probably never going to be implemented
---
I honestly think that autoaim is making the gameplay better. Think about how many more terrible people would be when running around trying to hit tanks. Before autoaim, primo was op because people could not hit him up close.
---
Nice find! Hopefully that means he also gets a new model. Current one may need some tweaks
---
WAKANDA FOREVER
---
They‚Äôre brawlers btw
---
It‚Äôs not the best band for you buck technically speaking, with tickets being better for Robo rumble and possibly Boss Fight. However there is word going around that legendary odds only go up when you open mega boxes and don‚Äôt count for normal/big boxes. If this is true, then it may be a good idea just to test your luck for new brawlers and increase your drop odds.
---
At least for duo showdown. The others maps are fine since spawn camping would be pretty shitty.
---
You forgot about the kairos Leon incident
---
Don't you dare do it to Mortis
---
* i always get my mark*
---
I got spike on my main, but no mortis, and I want him so bad... I have 8250 and 19 brawlers, missing leon, crow and mortis

Rip maybe one for a new phone

Gotcha, didn't know it was originally from Reddit thanks. Jw

In pretty sure it is 1.4k

I thinks this idea is a nice change. Atop of that, I'd be glad if Supercell changed the rewards on raking up. I really feel that, right now, they are completely worthless.

Good idea but people will start to abuse and start win trading

75 also gives you just 1 box :(

I guess I‚Äôm stuck here until I unlock Leon

Disagree. If your opponents get into your spawn area then it will be really hard to mount a comeback.

Who spends their time looking at bullets when they're trying to kill someone
---
Nita: Hi, do u like my bear
---
I thought about this yesterday, and forgot to post it here, thank you!
---
Bad idea, here is why: In showdown mode, poco would be an exploit, because he could hide in the poison healing forever. Brawlers like crow, primo and piper would also be broken, because they would be extremely hard to hit, since they would be flying non stop. nita, pam and jessie would be almost completely useless, because they can only have one sommon/building at a time (notice I didn‚Äôt include penny, thats because, with her star power, her turret would spam bombs non stop, which could be good?). Leon would also be useless, since he would do nothing but stay invisible. Don‚Äôt forget about Frank, and Tara, who would completely ruin everyone‚Äôs fun by not letting people play. I think that if all the brawlers listened above were banned in this modifier, then it could lean to better matches and less problems...but still, I don‚Äôt think its a good idea at all. but keep up with the ideas bro!
---
61 is my max. 
---
I don't know, NY phone is perfectly fine and works with every other app perfectly. This is a brawl stars software issue
---
This happened to me with bull and I kept moving the stick, clicking, and hoping it would straighten out. Finally I gave up, closes the app and disconnected from WiFi. I came back HIDING IN A BUSH WITH THREE GEMS. HOOOOW?!
---
Wait a minute there is a humor tag on this post...was this fake smh
---
It‚Äôs not fake... idk what tag to put
---
I've never had a problem against Leon, he has low health but high damage output. Seems balanced to me, he's a glass cannon
---
Leon seems really op
---
Every brawler already has footprints.
---
Happy cake day
---
Looks like a brawl ball arena
---
We have regular boxes, big boxes, and mega boxes. We are fine
---
Who is the person who wrote that?
---
Wait they fixed it?
---
I see your point, but personally I don't feel that Leon is OP to the point that the game is "broken" as it currently is.
---
Crow is nice

He used his first attack on the box, I saw that then only I went in.üòÇ
---
Maybe only in showdown when someone can spawn on you 
---
Waddaya think 
---
Pam x Bull
---
No but one and a half year ago this video was on their channel this isn‚Äôt even the real brawl stars that posted it
---
Some one who understands how to use him. Good job my dude!
---
Brian Stivale. I was looking on instagram for another game I play, Awesomenauts, and he voices a character in that game. Looked at his profile and saw this.
---
I actually disagree. Allowing for spawn immunity like that allows more strategic retreats. Being tactical and retreating into your own base should be beneficial, imo
---
Are you telling me spike is blue? üòë
---
Thanks! I check his videos to hear voice and I think Bo will have great lines.. Im hyped üò∂
---
El Primo and Bull are missing too, but a god drawing nonetheless 
---
Clash Royale in my opinion needs to fix two things. The most obvious is the trade token system. It's unacceptable the system has not been fixed yet. My clan chat is so full of request that it's obsolete for real purpose. 
---
The second biggest reason is the war league tiers. My clan's war trophies are just above 7000. What's the point for pushing forward? I see more and more members forgetting to use all three collections, not use their war attempt, or not participate in wars. A third thing to add in there is the Ram Rider, enough said...
---
I really enjoy Brawl Stars for what it is. I cannot speak to the debate vs Fortnite because I haven't played it. I will say it's nice to have zero temptation for in-app purchase for Brawl Stars! Their deals are garbage, even worse than Clash Royale.
---
skills
---
Are you kidding me. He need a buff for sure. Most of the community agress that he needs a buff
---
General reposti, you are a bold one.
---
You do realise that Leon has the same damage as Bull right? So Leon is technically an invisible Bull...
---
I never said that the gameplay was 500+. This was on my mini who‚Äôs for Darryl at around 300. I played there to try not to face teamers, because they would completely ruin my strategy-video.
---
Yes it is Obama ofc 
---
Which movie we're you watching?
---
Because you had the level advantage and 3 spawnables to pester the Tara and Frank?
---
Looks awesoke. Reminds me of Robbery Bob
---
**Star Power:** Jesus walk üåö
---
It‚Äôs a nerf,plus it kinda make sense that Leon can only use his Super in a bush,after all he is a chameleon.
---
So when he is out of bushes he can‚Äôt use his Super
---
r/brawlrecruit
---
Yes I get that, but why
---
NICE
---
Because leon is way too OP
---
Interesting
---
[removed]
---
So he can‚Äôt use his Super that fast and helps other brawlers a chance
---
‚ÄúFast‚Äù lol
---
I‚Äôve heard some funny cries of OP from bad players, but this may take the cake.
---
Lets hope its not for a limited time
---
:)
---
I was like hey that's a cool skin, then I saw the watermark and thought it was an even cooler design lmao.
---
And you have to key in a password?
---
This idea sounds good in showdown but in gem grab people tend to setup spawn traps and you can't really get out of them without attacking while invincible. So maybe have this mechanic only in duos?
---
Tats like practice mode in another way...
---
Can we add the fuckers that dont move until the 10s or so
---
Cool
---
I‚Äôd rather just have him recover while attacking if anything. The ability to get away while not interrupting his regen timer would increase the situations he can be aggressive in.
---
I reported him:D
---
Typically u go in a bush anyways before u super 
---
No one shall know
---
But not everybody does that...
---
Would help people who dosent have leon 
---
Yeah I meant that more Instagram account should too
---
So cavern churn?
---
That more Instagram accounts should give credit
---
He did
---
Dunno 
---
...is there a bone in his eye? 
---
Yeah but I think that feature must not be there where you put it, but inside the settings.
---
That‚Äôs not hot
---
Ye sure, but people with 10k who played the game for 1.5 years, dont even have one
---
Yeah I was trying to push my crow to 500 and got matched against a team of players with around 740 trophies each
---
I had like 430 trophies and the randoms with me had around the same
---
It's awful
---
I don't believe it does anything. I just think its meant to look cool.
---
Skins just make a brawler LOOK cool, that's it
---
Coolness
---
Good effort and video!!!
---
I think they should let shots go through immune players. It doesn't bother me that they are protected, but if they intentionally block your shots, which would hit someone else who's not immune. That really triggers me.
---
It‚Äôs the tongue
---
...in his eye
---
You sure? The wizard barley seems like it‚Äôs better than the original skin. I spent 109 gems on the red nose Nita surely it‚Äôs not all the same üò¢
---
Your post has been removed, make sure to use the body of a post to elaborate on the title.
---
Darryl does not suck and I hate it when people compare him to bull cause he's totally different from bull
---
I was wondering about this as well. Thanks for the info
---
The projectiles should pass immune players. It's so annoying to see your shots being absorbed by an immune player, which would have killed another if it wasn't for the immune player. I really hate to see this shit in showdown. You kill the mate and walk over to the next guy and by the time you reach him, his partner spawns and SOAKS every shot. So dumb. 
---
1) It is good for the game to have a few high skill cap brawlers that u have to learn to play well to have succes with.
---
2) If u buff a high skill cap character (that does not need a buff) it will break the competitive game, while if u dont u just have a brawler that is hard to push for NON COMPETITIVE players. 
---
3) If u like playing mortis u can learn him and have succes, if u dont like him u can just go on solo sd and go for 3/4 place, its grindy but its easy to do. 
---
I was off by 2 I swear to god being f2p suckd
---
You are just noob
---
We need way more non-squishies in general. Right now 60% of the characters are poke&amp;run away styled.
---
That's indeed another great point to bring to the table! 
---
A fact for you : A vocal noisy minority don't represent the silent majority. Remember that
---
UR garbage
---
Oof
---
Almost every player is noob, the game just went global and even most of the beta players are rll bad.
---
Yeah , this could be good thing,  cuz mortis it's a worth mythical hero , realy , small damage,  small attack range , small hp bar , very very bad hero and he is mythical!  WHAT ?
---
I used to think it was i always get my ma
---
He goes invisible 
---
I've only played Mortis up to like 120 in Showdown since i couldn't be skillful enough to be effective in Gem Grab or Brawl Ball with him, but i've found him good against Piper so long as her super ain't charged. Since her damage scales the further she is from her target and he gets the job done close and dashes toward her quickly, it's quite easy to bring her down. 
---
I usually play a prowling type game with Mortis in SD though, waiting till the right moment when a target nears death or just shot all their ammo at some bush or other fighter. 
---
i got 14! ty supercell
---
This should probably be a post, not a comment. Just sayin
---
why?
---
I started teaming and seeing them around 1200
---
That makes perfect sense here. Haha. Thanks.
---
Hmm... But decreasing reload time or increasing movement speed will make him OP in brawl ball. 
---
And if other brawler is on the other side of river and shooting towards me. Why i can't ?  It is not like this change will let us escape. I mean if i see brawler with lower health so i definitely want to attack him/her. But because of river i can't. But if i am lower then they can attack through river and they will for sure. 
---
This change will give him a fair chance to fight and then win/die. 
---
Attack over walls is different because only 2 brawlers can do that. But through water ? guess how many ? 21/22. 
---
Removed. Keep your post titles descriptive and provide context. Additionally do not use low effort/all caps/clickbait titles.
---
I pushed him in Cavern Churn Duo Showdown with a max Bo on my team to give me vision. Just rush the middle and get as many power-boxes you can, then mostly stay there. If no other teams has max Bo, your best strategy will be to stay in the grass and wait for tanks or other brawlers to come. If you see a squishy brawler outside the grass while you‚Äôre in there, then rush out and blast him! These are often easy kills that will give you more power-cubes. This strategy really helped me pushing him!
---
No
---
Fantastic job! Can I use your sketch? I want to draw it using a computer. I will show you as the author
---
Beautiful, harmonious equilibrium.
---
Why is no one in the theater yet üòÇ
---
Sorry for bad quality. It seems to happen only in solo showdown, and the nicknames appear normally in the battle record. Happens about every 3 matches 
---
Sorry for any grammar mistakes
---
It increases playtime as there aren‚Äôt much brawlers yet in the game (cuz it is new). Not only that, it also motivates players to keep playing, therefore more money for them.
---
It's not a bug, I read on another reddit post that it means others have a high trophy count,  so everyone gets ??? to prevent people teaming one person because of their skill level.
---
Island invasion v2
---
I said max 1 or 2 tiles for mortis, so it won't be able to cross bigger lakes, and I actually think that darryl lake bug isnt' a big problem, just a little buff
---
It's not possible
---
I really wish I get him soon lmao
---
He legit signed it at bottom left corner...
---
I bought it lol
---
Yep :v
---
It's a little too expensive in my country, then, i think it's not worth to buy.
---
Not really, he couldn't cross bigger lakes that mostly are over 3 tiles. I don't know about puddle splash, but it has fairly small lakes
---
Oh man... You was strong then.
---
Lmao
---
Asymmetric maps aren't there problem, they're fine if they're balanced.
---
Can't see the problem here.
---
If you still want to do something then you should stop playing Mike, because in this picture you're part of "the problem".
---
I usually just spin to spare Someone because we know we can‚Äôt beat each other and if we do then a bull Will finish us.
---
There is only one brawl ball map with lakes and it has pretty small lakes, so it wouldn't affect that much
---
He is also good against Poco
---
I got Mortis (my first mythic) when i was at 5k
---
I definitely say that he isn't the strongest Brawler... But he is SO fun to play with!
---
I hope you get him soon!
---
Mortis can just kick the ball over those lakes like he does on ground
---
whats your trophy count?
---
Yeh their servers have been overloaded or something with global release. Very annoying that it hasn't been fixed yet. DW the problem is on their end not yours
---
Yep. I was like... WTF? How is that possible? 
---
It's so weird... I wish it was in my main. But hey, it's a legendary, i'm not going to complain.
---
I wish i had Leon too. But, okay, i was bored of playing with the same brawlers, then, Crow is enough for me :P
---
He's point is just very fast movement, so he can easily escape everyone or kill lobbers or low-health brawlers
---
How was your reaction?
---
U can still die ok
---
Same here. The game is nearly unplayable sometimes with 200 mega in WiFi and 9 ms ping lol.
---
Excuse me what the f.Pro mortis players can play with him in pretty much every game mode.People say he suck becase it‚Äôs ACTUALLY very hard to play with him.But I believe supercell needs to remake mortis like they did to darrel because he don‚Äôt stand a chance against brawlers that have more than 4000 health 
---
Nice try but you can't get a friend request from a showdown match or send one.
---
HAPPY CAKE DAY
---
Whats an e transfer
---
You can find them on the BS discord server. Just look the one up with the most members and **BAM!** you're done!
---
F
---
He really needs a damage buff.
---
But a brawler like bull can easily kill most of the other brawlers and bear those 3 shots. That would creat pretty unfair situations at 3v3, and in the current way you have just to go back and put some more pressure after enemies advance.
---
And do you have the same connection losses without wifi? And with other wifi networks? 
---
Yes , he need more HP and more reload speed , and buff 4 his ultimate ability .
---
Am I the only one who thinks it's OK for duo showdown? A lot of times when I'm waiting for my partner to respawn to save me or at least take out another opponent brawler so I could die in peace.
---
I mean if the problem is getting 3 shot KO by a respawning shotgunner you have ample amount of time to actually gain distance between you and the newly respawn player since they made the white bubble so obvious now.
---
It's more problematic for gem grab when you literally have like less than 20% chance to pick up gems at opponent's base before the opponent respawn at their area to kill you. Unless you are a bull/crow/piper/EL primo/Leon who can grab the gems and super away (mortis could swipe away) it is very hard to make a comeback unless you have coordinated team wipe kills
---
My brain hurts.
---
Yeah they make cute things. Designs for kids
---
Thanks :)
---
I know

The trophies on my teammate crow?

Ayy its lich

I was under the assumption it was based on the brawlers individual trophy count, but this being the 2nd game tonight with this mix, I‚Äôm questioning myself

I do not know what he wants to get.

 but it is dishonest

What do you mean I took it when I was playing
---
Yup

(Confession time, I sometimes team with same brawler as me or if someone other than tanks spins first)

Ok

Wait i thought that cause the player has blue health

Supercell is probably working on a fix right now, keep calm. The servers are a bit laggy because the game just came out! Think of it, sometimes when a fortnite update is added, the game can also run trash. Remember dynamite?
---
I had never seen that left one b4 
---
R u sure it exists?

---
What I'm saying is that Mortis's attack is being bounded by both limitations of an attack command and a movement command. I think that's his tradeoff for having such a unique attack - that moves him.
---
Another solution I can think of to help Mortis is maybe decreasing his attack reload time if he hit a brawler, and the more brawlers he hit with one attack the quicker the next reload will be. That change will reward skillful Mortis while not make him OP in Brawl Ball since he's infamous in that mode with his dribble.
---
Alright, good but how tf do you play ricochet?

Funny enough someone already pointed it out that the post got reposted making your post a repost.

---
Here you go then. Understand how frustrating that can be.
---
I thought the title said "Darth Leon"
---
Spike
---
Hiest and gem grab. Wouldn't recommend SD
---
You saying that I was top 100? Where did you get that from? 
---
Also, Darryls always gets rejected when trying to team, cus he easily backstabs other brawlers. That‚Äôs why you don‚Äôt want to team with others when playing darryl...
---
I just pushed my level 7 bull to rank 20 in showdown üôà
---
After looking into this further, this is clearly common knowledge. 
---
However, I am at ~2000 overall trophies, and even with my ~150 Brock I should not be matching 9 bots with less than 20 trophies each. 
---
This is incredibly disappointing and has tainted my view of a creative new supercell game.
---
Username checks out
---
Pathetic.
---
It‚Äôs a joke guy
---
*Dashes behind you*
---
Nothing personal kid.
---
Exactly
---
The crazy burst damage of spike‚Äôs shots.
---
Are u really trying to teach me how to play showdown? You have a 500 darryl.. that doesn‚Äôt mean shit
---
LoL im at 1600 trophies and yet to get a super rare brawler
---
oh the accuracy in this post.
---
Cool, Dynamike is a dinosaur now. 
---
Nice alt 
---
I have every brawler above 500, even some above 600. Please tell me your username and i‚Äôll check out leaderboard. If you‚Äôre not ¬´top 100¬ª anymore then tell me your band and your name. Would be fantastic to search it up!
---
You mean the art that you took from the game files and watermarked as your own.
---
Is this shit post 
---
Dude was i in the same game TheTrees
---
You don‚Äôt 
---
I never said it was my art...
---
Do not talk shit about my boi 
---
We all get old! Fathertime is undefeated 
---
Choose the name Bloom because it fits its type, growth, etc. 
---
But it‚Äôs not art; it‚Äôs just a picture of something that‚Äôs in the files. I‚Äôm pretty sure op didn‚Äôt even get that picture himself. I‚Äôm pretty sure he just stole it off another post and put a green background on it.
---
It doesn't change unless you get a mythic or legendary, then it becomes variable
---
They have a big delay before respawning, if you go quick and use some dash special like piper, bull, darryl or el primo you still can get the gems away from their spawn. It's very important for the game that no one can supress you in your spawn, otherwise every match would become just awful when the first team succeeds in that. Spawm immunity is what allows your team to come back to the game, not the opposite 
---
I dont care about it actually , since im able to lvl up all the other cards i have
---
This is gold
---
He really needs a buff tho
---
Cool 
---
But the watermarks you used were your own username, implying that you were the sole creator/finder of this new skin, which you are not. THAT is why people reproached you. You could have used another watermark that didn't have your username in it (for instance, the 'stolen from brawl stars reddit' watermark) and everything would have been fine.
---
Well , they do Team up in Showdown 
---
I think its monthly but it doesnt affect low trophees 
---
Ye but this guy usually mention the creator
---
Spike will most likely win
---
But they should definitely not.
---
Who even plays Rico in SD? Not bad, but definitely not the best
---
Tid nerdy found it in file (i know how he did)
---
I think it's ok right now cuz it counter the auto aim spam
---
You should be playing every brawler to some degree.
---
Lol i had 17 brawlers when i was 7000 
---
Same here. Never got any of mine through a box. Its frustrating 
---
Ppl can play Rico in hot maze and Cavern Churn
---
Damn long range, throwers and dont forget darryl.
---
That's almost 3/4 the nunber of gems I have
---
Not that much i got that 2 times in 2 months
---
No i have tara and every epic but i dont play them because i can play them on my main
---
But i dont want to accidentally lock the lock. We need a lock for the lock for the boxes
---
How about gold because it is useles when you have all powerpoints
---
Gotcha
---
And upgradet all brawlers
---
Lol for showdown place mines &amp; guard one of the main routes and leave em to die
---
If they do that people will change the sign to up-down-up-down or something else. Reporting will also be a problem because thousands of people will just report everything and anything. Its a question of gaming culture and playing fair, and thats difficult to force on to players.
---
Progressing =/= just trophies. In CR you can still get stars for your daily chest without being pressured about your trophies. The same should be possible in this game. 
---
Ok, thanks for the info :) I will keep an eye on it :)
---
anyone know if legendary ofers appers on the store? i only see an offer for crow when le√≥n come to the game?? thx
---
No it‚Äôs not worth it
---
My lucky factor was 0.1488 then I bought the max amount of pp for mike and now it‚Äôs 0.1564 no box was even opened!!!!     #Facts
---
Yea it will for 500+ gems I think
---
Ok, i dont have any of those so it explains that. Just have to have open some more boxes i suppose :)
---
Also what's the best way to spend gems for a f2p player? Currently I have 32 stacked
---
Bless me with your luck please
---
Not exactly a movie that‚Äôs selling to well
---
While people get one at 1k or less , thats fking unfair , supercell should reward high trophies people more
---
It isnt an issue, replays arent in the game yet
---
I think he needs his magical blue stick to be turned into a bow
---
* confused noises *
---
And it‚Äôs great!
---
I never got to the top ranks of CR TBH so I dont really know. but cant you gain +30 in CR as well as lose them? or am i mistaken here? 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
the nice thing is that skill highly affects trophy gain or loss since it becomes equal, win = +5 in all modes (except SD) and lose is -5.. SD is +-6,+-3,0 for duos and +-7, +-6, +-4, +-1, 0 for solo IIRC?? something like that... so really everyone is gaining and losing at the same rates assuming your equal to everyone else.. skill pushes you to increase always. 
---
Thank you!
---
That sums it up lmao
---
Let me guess this isn't even your final form? ( please no more)

thats true, but also if that 1 is in his camp and two shotgunners are in your camp waiting to 2 shot you as soon as invulnerable is gone is that fair? and it would happen a lot more if we had respawn invulnerables fall off like that. 
---
A really BIG BUFF, he seems really weak.

IDK, you could also ask why the left has a different face shape; they just did it to fit with the advertisement style.

This happens in all solo games, once your trophy count is high enough. It is suppose to prevent grouping with names you may know.

There is no set time for any offer

---
"The matchmaking system avoids duplicate brawlers"
---
What? Theres 2 joysticks just like you'd use in game what do you mean how? And then autoaim is a button and holding another button makes the joystick do your super. And uncomfortable? What do you mean a controller made for our hands would be more uncomfortable? You make 0% sense
---
Sadly nothing can be done. The only thing could be to add metheor to all showdown matches and in the none event modifier ones the metheor will only spawn when it is 100% sure they are teaming
---
I think it has something to do with supercell‚Äôs servers.
---
No you're right but that's what I find frustrating, 30 is a large amount to lose, so if you get in a bad frame of mind, if you lose a few matches in a row you're losing like 120 crowns instead of like, 28 in Brawlstars. That's a huge morale blow. I like the smaller increments very much. 
---
I also like the fact that as you pointed out, you can win/lose different amounts in SD. It just gives quite a bit more wiggle room in terms of how much you'll drop if you tilt, which for people like me who rage easily is really helpful.

I actually didn't realize there's a quick fire button until a friend told me. I was surprised by everyone's good aim. 
---
but teaming does exist, so why would u teach them a strategy that only works at super low trophies 
---
He has a good ult. His dmg is kinda lacking but he is a decent hero.
---
I hope so, but I dont think Supercell wants to do the fairest possible queue, you know, they make money out of the frustation.
---
Yea, maining one brawler as a brand new player is bad, but this is not a player fault. I cant decide which brawler you must play, but Supercell should be smart enough to know that someone that is playing for just one week shouldnt be matched with a guy thats playing for a year and has 7000 more trophies.
---
I really feel stupid to be explaining why this is bad for the game hahaha
---
Would have been awesome if you had added the number of bullets in total and how many hits are required to fully load the super.  
---
Still nice work though.
---
exactly. no special offers, no new year offers, only one real money christmas offer. I got 32$ waiting to spend in offers.
---
i can win above 500 just fine with darryl, mayb ill have to share some pro 600+ showdown darryl gameplay xd
---
It won‚Äôt be back next year lmao 
---
If everyone just bought him they lose revenue because impatient people wouldn‚Äôt buy boxes
---
There‚Äôs a few things you can do. 
---
First, avoid getting hit by her main attack. This seems obvious, but it‚Äôs super important to remember hat she charges her super relatively easily, so the first thing you can do is just not get hit. This means keeping your distance, or trying to push her into another fight.
---
Second, Use the walls. If you use the walls properly. You can push almost any brawler in the direction you want them to go, even if they have way more power cubes than you. It‚Äôs all about finding angles that you can attack, or faking them out to make them waste their shots. 
---
Third, use other brawlers to your advantage. I already touched on this before, but pushing Shelly into another fight is a great way to take care of her, and potentially use her super on another enemy if she does manage to get it. My favorite thing to do in showdown is to manipulate the walls and enemies to push them into fighting each other, and it‚Äôs fantastic when you get the hang of it.
---
Four, dealing with her super. So let‚Äôs say she gets her super up, there still a few things you can do. Most Shelly players use auto aim for their super, and you can use this to survive. If you‚Äôre a turret user, throwing the turret down right when she uses her super will cause her to auto aim towards the turret instead of you. If you‚Äôre not a turret user, keep as much distance between you as possible, or find an enemy or turret or power box to manipulate the super as best you can. Try dodging back and forth or tuning on a zig zag pattern so the Shelly has a hard time aiming. 
---
At the end of the day, there really is only so much you can do. Definitely follow these tips and you‚Äôll find some success, especially with practice. But there‚Äôs no way to 100% counter it all the time, and that‚Äôs just the way it is. Just practice, and don‚Äôt take things too seriously, it is a game after all. It‚Äôs meant to be for fun. Anyway, best of luck! Happy Brawling!
---
The shop is the quickest way. But I haven‚Äôt see. Legendary offers lately. I need Crow and Leon. But they are nowhere to be seen :( 
---
I see what you're saying yeah, fair point :)
---
El_Primo_Is_Gone.exe
---
Wasn't implying that. He played like a 30 trophy player. My Brock which is level 5 is 330.
---
its just this, ppl playing from beta release seem to be very unlucky.
---
A stun would be too OP.  Especially with that damage.  
---
Yeah I'm very new and very shitty with Darryl and just go off my experience with him. Guess I should watch some vids finally and learn how to play all the brawlers.
---
no its not lol
---
It is p2w though...
---
Maybe not as much as COC or CR but still p2w
---
I like how you tried to be as lazy as possible by just coloring over the original dialog

How about making the entire story campaign? Like Pam is Jessie and Colt's mother and then idk Colt goes on a journey to get a cactus for Pam's recipe but is attacked by Spike and saved by idk mysterious bird assasin with toxic daggers. The Family Pam/Jess/Colt made Richocet, Barley and Darryl to help them in fight.Shelly is a bandit who is being chased years by Colt. Nita and Leon are siblings who were spilt when born. Nita had a birthday party and Brawlers decided to meet her with Leon so he used smoke bomb to hide from Nita and give her a surprise (I mean just appering in front of her)... And other... Give me your suggestions please

And don't steal

---
Bo is Nita's dad?
---
Supercell cares more about the players then valuta, so They Don‚Äôt want to many good offers so not everyone is walking around with a specific brawler that is legendary or mythical.
---
Why is she so fat?
---
I honestly like that too.
---
the 3rd one is kinda the essence of teaming isnt it? 
---
Lupa is the ancient roman wolf who safed Romulus and Remus (do they have these names in English? Idn xD). Guess lupus means wolf since it s the male form for lupa.
---
For real though, Barley is a bartender and Ricochet was a pool table robot. It's a possibility.
---
Huh? 
---
Does that mean you can get the rewards from the trophies again and again? Im rn at 1.6k Trophies and I just wondered
---
I‚Äôm reading this with a British accent. 
---
I stop them with my piper , it‚Äôs the best way imo (if you can use her )
---
What mode are you talking about
---
I like how everyone is at 6 trophies except for that one poor little spike
---
He‚Äôs inaccurate at long range but really good at close and medium range especially with his super.
---
Nice, but should probably be an area behind goal where you respawn, not in front.
---
Simple fix: click store, buy 2000gems and wait for legendary offer appears in store
---
That looks so rage inducing but I like it
---
i have a  trouble like yours .. :(

similar to a current bounty map..

good point, I guess ive seen that too but the other thing shotgunners often expect is that if you teamed up then you should be willing to let them walk beside you :D How often I see people let shotgunners snuggle in amazes me.

well thats the only appropriate way to do it IMO so keep up the good work!

---
I‚Äôve been thinking this for weeks, and I started thinking about Jessie as of this post
---
That's a horrible idea, pushing new brawlers would be almost impossible, it would be like clash Royale and I quit that shitshow of a game for this. 
---
Actually the Shelly will kill the Colt she has WAYYYYYYYYYYY more powers then him and she has a super and he dosnt.
---
Gotta love that piper for Robo Rumble

r/woooosh
---
This map looks like so much fun for flanking
---
Lol if you play you have a 50% change because there is alwais a winner of 2 teams. 
---
So what he likes Shelly? Let him tilt at high levels and when he switches let him get dumped on. What would you rather happen matchmake on total trophies and have it be impossible to push new brawlers or deal with these guys?

There's not even 21 brawlers in the game since a lot are league reward
---
Spicy Mike needs the slightest bit of extra detail on his peppers, they look too closely like the original dynamite sticks.

You gonna say what it is called???
---
Looks like those mummies from star wars
---

Pam is confirmed to be jessie‚Äôs mother. The father isn‚Äôt confirmed but you can make any connection you want but the devs did say pam is jessie‚Äôs mother and they are part of the junker family. We may see more junker family brawlers in the future 
---
You think that's bad.......we had a squad of 200-300~ trophy brawlers face a Leon crow and Frank at 5-600 trophies with star powers multiple times. IDK sometimes you just gotta shake it off(along with 5 trophies lol)
---
One route to the next... I‚Äôd love to see this implemented 
---
Pennys main weapon is very similar to a hand cannon.
---
Here's a theory - Pam is Jessie's mom - duh! But also cplt is Jessie's brother - Linda duh! 
---
Jessie is Penny's best friend (hence both turrets)
---
Bull is Pam's husband, and together, Pam and Jessie created all of the robots (Ricochet based off of Colt, Darryl based off of Bull, barley based off of Dynamike) Dynamike is Pam's brother.
---
Also, Bo is nita's father. 
---
Frank and Mortis are best friends (both of their star powers are about skulls and stuff) 
---
If you guys have any more connections let me know! I think it'd be cool!

It‚Äôs possible, my little bro got two brawlers in one box and I got salty lol
---
Yeah that's what I have found, seems to be something their end obviously, but what?
---
Really hope they fix it soon, hate being unable to play the game proper. 
---
I thought thus was another n00bs' "dArRyL iS tRaSh" posts 
---
Well... That was fast
---
they're basically the same thing tho
---
Are you detarted?
---
Yeh I sort by new. üòé
---
Ok. Leon is literally the most broken brawler in the game, but you think he needs to be BUFFED? So he can be as strong as Spike and Crow, who he‚Äôs already stronger than? No. Already strong enough, and he definitely needs a nerf
---
Thanks
---
What is detarted?
---
Thank you :) 
---
Omg so mature
---
A higher stage of retarded.
---
i would hate to be that guy 
---
Rip, the dude probably failed the el primo glitch with only 11 mins
---
Should be the same as RR, good luck getting past 4 mins legit tho
---
Anyone who has ever played brawl stars will dislike it, idk y u put it out
---
He needs a buff I played him a lot and I cant even get past 50 trophies without dying to el primo and he sucks when he turns invisibe because poco can find him
---
I‚Äôm smart
---
Rico is mustard actually.
---
Just piss off already. You still suck at trolling.
---
Then you‚Äôre just bad. I don‚Äôt have personal experience, but he can dish out ridiculous amounts of damage, and get away or ambush with his super.
---
mOrE bEtTeR wAtErMaRk
---
I would buy this.
---
I am not the bad, you are, he is bad a needs a buff
---
e and √© is pronounced completely differently
---
"How to ruin showdown".
---
The pengu 77
---
Okay just tell yourself that. Have fun when he gets nerfed!
---
i've been in this subreddit for a week so sorry for unintentionally stealing ur post i guess
---
Everything would look the same it's just a different colour, idk maybe I'm just used to playing games where there just a lot of different things happening at once. In this case simpler maybe better 
---
The fortnite leaks of brawl stars.
---
You are the meanest person on the world not nice person
---
Np its not rly stealing and idc
---
Did I ask? 
---
Yes fat kid
---
He technically isn‚Äôt swearing 
---
OoOoO noice. üòçüëå
---
I dunno
---
Well, you know how you get season bonuses (coins) for being above a certain trophy count, is there a brawler bonus (coins) that you get when trophies are brought down?
---
Last time I checked we reached 40k but I didn't realize it doubled, hopefully we reach 100k üòÅ
---
Golden trash can. Sounds nice.
---
Happened to me 2 games ago lol
---
Wood league
---
I identify as a maple tree if you disagree with me you‚Äôre a bigot
---
Well it was hard to find a picture of Darryl's gun, so I kept Freddie's hands.
---
I am the exact same! I play only with randoms for these reasons and i did pretty well at 400 trophies with barley and 200 with everyone else.
---
So true üòÅ
---
Here is the biggest question, are your brawlers max?
---
Was me the first time I played bull
---
And I was second haha! I bet it was me
---
Oi oi oi my brother took a photo of my phone. Phone credit goes to me
---
I'd like it a lot if she had some sort of goggles 
---
He taking it down run
---
LOL, listen kid, only a 13 year old would say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm better than you‚Äù and immediately tells you ‚ÄúI‚Äôm top global‚Äù little kiddo, and yea I‚Äôm at 11.4k cups which is actually not top global which is more than you still, not bragging but proving you talk trash when you don‚Äôt check the facts, kid, check yourself before you wreck yourself
---
Well that's your opinion and you can't say randoms are stupid bc when you play with randoms you are a random 
---
We can balance him out afterwards with slower reload, less damage, slower travel time, less range etc. I think they need to do this because the 4th looks like decoration or something now.
---
Lol the security guys r trying to escort him out then he sees a bull coming and he gets away and leaves the guy get hit again lol
---
There are no more rank tokens after you hit rank 20 (I believe)
---
You have my respect a 500 bo at only level 6
---
All my brawlers lvl 7 and bellow, tho my frank lvl 4 xd
---
Then yeah, connection. Also the one who has more Power cubes or is higher level, should win in a 1v1 Bull fight
---
Nope, my biggest lvl on brawler right now is 8 on Shelly
---
This man is asking for downvotes lmao
---
No, he doesn‚Äôt need a buff. 
---
Maybe join a club, if your looking for one go to r/brawlrecruit 
---
Epic moment, mind if I save this clip to make it part of the 2019 montage?
---
https://youtu.be/I-ZlI4t1ZY4
---
He‚Äôs actually balanced imo. Plus I‚Äôm SD games, he‚Äôs commonly picked, he‚Äôs the most played brawler second to Leon. If you wanted to change him, I‚Äôd reduce the damage his super does, and reduce the time it takes to charge it.
---
It is obvious u were gonna win but he deserves to get 1 shot,he was using auto aim üò§
---
Then yeah , buy it 
---
Then I‚Äôd say token doublers are best because if you don‚Äôt get the legendaries you get power points instead
---
Btw there is a special offer for 600 token doublers for 19 gems
---
If the Ball crosses the white line, everybody respawn at the center, as if it were a goal. More similar to real life soccer, but the center and not the corner
---
In fact, she was gonna be named ‚ÄúMaMa J.‚Äù Referring to jesse.
---
Maybe bull is the father ü§£
---
Dude, delete this and go to r/BrawlRecruit
---
Um season rewards vary, some are coins, some are boxes etc. Depending on how high your total trophies was, you‚Äôll get keys based on that. For me, I‚Äôm at 6.9k so I receive 560 keys after season reset
---
I'll pay 1337 gems!
---
Do you mind if I search your tag?
---
I mean coins also costs gems...
---
There ideas are actually very cool. Supercell, get to work !
---
I've bought it one time before and because of that I could upgrade her and also got Spike after 5, 6 boxes. After I get 3 more gems I will probadly buy it again
---
Good skin
---
yes, were salty we dont have leon
---
Same as you
---
Your english are a lot of very really good bro
---
just get ur super, ur leon, stop complaining 
---
Carbon Fiber or Shade (Shadow?) 
---
I have dynamike but I only have like 500 trophies how is this possible? I played the beta when the game was only on Android is that why?
---
Some people have even gotten mythics and legendaries in the same box. It's all luck
---
This is so sad.
---
Nah I couldn't even two shot a 1 power daryl at point blank, I just got him so he's level 1 tho
---
its so funny seeing ppl making fake accounts to do this because they dont have the balls to do it with there real account.
---
Congrats man
---
I love your concepts but I would have to say you should make some adjustments to your brawlers to be a little bit more balance. I‚Äôm on my phone so I‚Äôll be doing multiple posts!
---
1. Chief sounds really polished already, I especially love the chained attacks which slightly reminds me of LeBlanc from League of Legends, but reverting back the the original start. The only bad part of this move though is that, aside from his attacking, he really has no mobility, if you think about it. I think it should be able to dash, just like Mortis but maybe the more enemies he goes through, his dashes do a bit more damage than the previous or doing less damage, stacking up to three times (ammo). After he hasn‚Äôt attacked an enemy for 3 secs, the buff resets. 
---
His Super sounds OP, just because the wolves have 2,500 hp while Tara‚Äôs super with her star power makes it so her clone has 2,000 HP. I would make it that the wolves are very fast in mobility but having around 700-1000 HP doing close range damage.
---
Chief‚Äôs Star Power is awesome, keep it the way it is, or the wolves, when casted on an area does minuscule damage but also slows anyone in the certain radius for 1 second! 
---
I love you both
---
nobody likes darryl
---
or just play leon and dont be bad like this guy
---
Damn I always knew android users couldn‚Äôt spell üòÇ
---
Thank you mate. :)
---
spinning 
---
thats stupid
---
From a big box?
---
Always team with people u can kill quicker than vice versa 
---

---
Not to mention BSB is unofficial and not made by Supercell.
---
No I'm saying literal children don't need to be exposed to this shit lol
---
People who have all brawlers save boxes so when a new brawler releases they can get it faster
---
Oh ok makes sense ty
---
Waiting for new content. Got all the PowerPoints, but gold is missing. Imo it‚Äôs not worth opening all the boxes tho. 
---
r/fortnitebr
---
Yep üëç 
---
That's the Brawler's trophies, not the player's.
---
Please god no
---
At least two? Got it
---
Mi piace un bordello
---
Darryl is so much fun to play in brawl ball. You can use the super to dribble the ball and if your entire team just died you can use it to roll in front of the goal to save the ball
---
Oh okay
---
2. As for Shade, I love the concept of the reverse cone animation attack, it bring some plays and diversity to the game itself. I also imagined the attack animation perfectly. What if Shade Although shoots out an orb that does little to no damage, but when it comes back to Shade, the damage is more significant when it is returning back to the caster, similar to Ahri‚Äôs Q, in league of legends minus the initial damage Ahri has when she shoots her orb out. 
---
Super is fine, just the way it is, or it could be similar to Brock‚Äôs Super yet it is more bigger slow moving orb that once it reaches the top of the max tile, it explodes? 
---
As far as his Super with the 1.5x more damage sounds nice but it should be more where you can switch that debuff on another character, very similar to Zenyatta‚Äôs Discord, from Overwatch. 
---
Also Bo‚Äôs star power is really OP for cavern churn
---
I disagree. P2W means paying money to become stronger than F2P players. This could be items or other power ups that are unobtainable through F2P progression.
---
In Brawl Stars however, paying for loot boxes can be compared to buying an EXP boost. That's not P2W, it's a matter of speeding up progression. Some of the best Brawl Stars players are entirely F2P, and it's possible to max out your account for free.
---
Yeah and someone can reach 11k in a couple of weeks is that right? Plus it just means he‚Äôs skilled if he‚Äôs lvl 7 above 500 trophies, I don‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs your concern here
---
