It sure won't be a good update if they don't give Leon a voice and skin
---
Highly intelligent.
---
But I hate both gem grab and brawl ball. I say make heist permanent like in the beta days

Well yes but Darryl would roll to the other side and die giving the enemy team stars so actually no

How does winning negate a logical problem? You sound like those idiots who see problems all over society and ignore them because it didn‚Äôt affect you.... there is a glaring issue with the match making system since the new update, if you go through this entire thread it‚Äôs very obvious. This is just one example, my ability to pull the win out of my ass with tara supers isn‚Äôt relevant to the matter.
---
Flair checks out
---
Leon is my first.
---
I mean showdown already have too much randomness
---
1. Spawn location 
---
2. Crates (yes, official name for the powercube box) spawn location
---
3. Direction Powercubes spawn when you destroy crates
---
I find it funny how your afterthought contradicts your main post on a deep level.

But its possible
---
If you don‚Äôt want them to fix it don‚Äôt tell them it exists
---
Nah gem grab is much more diverse. Plus, it‚Äôs the OG gamemode. First one out, it‚Äôs tradition!
---
try band-aid with bibi. you get permanent baid-aid pretty much
---
This would be great at making more characters viable. Maybe I will play Poko if bull and Shelly don't get to camp in the middle every game.

Yeah you ‚Äúkid‚Äù I know how they work hence why I‚Äôm saying it needs to be changed... rocket science? Never said it was complicated I said it was broken and needs to be fixed... crying and bringing up exampling for supercell to see and hopefully fix are different matter. BTW playing with randoms shouldn‚Äôt be a risk of playing with players not in your category... think before you talk you clown.

Was it you that downvoted? I'm pretty sure you asked for what we thought of it so

Thanks!

This is giving me flashbacks

Oooooooo cool „Öá„Öà„Ñπ „Öã„Öã„Öã
---
I have the same problem, so I found another way. I choose the brawler that has the star power I want, then I turn off wifi and choose the brawler I want to glitch. After pressing play, I turn on wifi and it works.
---
If you have an ios device, there is screen capture built in if you are updated.
---
Really? You must be a noob.
---
To be honest nobody ever likes this gem grab map
---
Oh,  I found it on my friends status. Sorry for repost
---
I did it

It would work really well for erratic blocks and dune drift because they dont have a very defined center or symmetry.

That's actually cool enough to where I'd want to play shelly.

Why wouldn‚Äôt you put bull before shelly?

Will we join with this mode to normal game or specially game where everyone has this mode? 
---
If someone can join to normal game, that people would always die (for example on 3vs3) and game would be unfair because you dont see your health, but your teammate see his hp. I think you mean what i mean.
---
Nop. I have one better thing than that, shelly with mortis star power. Or band-aid bull

I literally opened more than 150 boxes and got nothing, still 6 star powers to unlock :(

They have immature minds, they think everyone is trying to insult them or oppose them. Just ignore these denegerates, they are not worth your time.

They really aren‚Äôt, star points are for buying skins in the shop and thats really it.  I doubt people who have played the game for so long would think earning a skin is worth it, even if they do buy a skin its just the same gameplay, over and over and over again. I really think supercell should expand the brawler roster because theres really nothing to do when you reach the top.
---
I swear Nita is still crazy without hyper bear I got mine from rank 15 to 20 in one night without the SP on heist
---
You are a mad man

This can be a fun bounty map that have the 1 star bounty spawn random on the pool. All player going to use darryl roll to get the star. Fucking awesome man.

I've saved 12600 star points just for something like this. Why do I care about skins when I still need to get brawlers. It's a good compromise if we can buy non cosmetics from star points

Not specifically win trading, but he's losing trophies to be able to gain them easier, right? Not only that, but when you get down to the double digits is mostly absolute beginners, so he could be making their experience kind of awful.

I'm not surprised such a stupid and erroneous comment got upvoted so much considering the kind of people that frequent the sub. There's a reason why she is almost never seen in competitions pre-band aid, and it has absolutely nothing to do with being a "complete all in one" without weakness.

Not funny, didn't laugh. Your joke is so bad I would have preferred the joke went over my head and you gave up re-telling me the joke. To be honest this is a horrid attempt at trying to get a laugh out of me. Not a chuckle, not a hehe, not even a subtle burst of air out of my esophagus. Science says before you laugh your brain preps your face muscles but I didn't even feel the slightest twitch. 0/10 this joke is so bad I cannot believe anyone legally allowed you to be creative at all. The amount of brain power you must have put into that joke has the potential to power every house on Earth. Get a personality and learn how to make jokes, read a book. I'm not saying this to be funny I genuinely mean it on how this is just bottom barrel embarrassment at comedy. You've single handedly killed humor and every comedic act on the planet. I'm so disappointed that society has failed as a whole in being able to teach you how to be funny. Honestly if I put in all my power and time to try and make your joke funny it would require Einstein himself to build a device to strap me into so I can be connected to the energy of a billion stars to do it, and even then all that joke would get from people is a subtle scuff. You're lucky I still have the slightest of empathy for you after telling that joke otherwise I would have committed every war crime in the book just to prevent you from attempting any humor ever again. We should put that joke in text books so future generations can be wary of becoming such an absolute comedic failure. Im disappointed, hurt, and outright offended that my precious time has been wasted in my brain understanding that joke. In the time that took I was planning on helping kids who have been orphaned, but because of that you've waisted my time explaining the obscene integrity of your terrible attempt at comedy. Now those kids are suffering without meals and there's nobody to blame but you. I hope you're happy with what you have done and I truly hope you can move on and learn from this piss poor attempt.

I enjoyed watching this way to much lmao
---
Ah yeah I didn‚Äôt notice that to begin with. It‚Äôs annoying when people go for the kill at the last minute like that, but that‚Äôs just a part of playing with randoms.
---
The trophies of your mortis is relevant because that‚Äôs what matchmaking is based on. Brawler trophy number is considered above total trophy number which Brawl Stars/Supercell confirmed themselves. It even comes up as a tip when you‚Äôre loading into a game.
---
Also, just because they are low in total trophies overall it doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre bad players. A lot of high level players have second accounts, which might be possible here given the significantly high number of trophies for one of their brawlers compared to their total trophy number. Seeing as your mortis and their brawlers were of similar trophy number I think it‚Äôs actually good matchmaking by Brawl Stars.

I'd do fucking ANYTHING for the chance to reproduce with u/brawler999. A N Y T H I N G. And the fact that I can't is quite honestly too much to fucking bear.

Yes, thank you! I mean you can be older then 15 and play brawl stars so ‚Äúadult humor‚Äù should not get this hate just ignore it or (I don‚Äôt want to say grow up) but sometime the time will come when this kind of free speech will be natural
---
Where's my boy Tick :(
---
Probably not tbh.  Supercell games are built to be relevant for several years,  and CoC proves that they can do that with their games.  CoC is 7 years old and is still their most relevant game.  It also still has 14M YT subscribers.  Brawl Stars may not be as relevant 7 years from now, but it won‚Äôt be close to dead.
---
That‚Äôs also why Supercell kills so many games.  They wanna make sure that they last.
---
I figured you were shelving him, but it still keeps your league down making other trophies easier.
---
The new system gives mediocre trophy road one-time rewards and expires a ton of trophies every week so it makes more sense to shelve most of your brawlers than it does to play them all.

I have been inspired to play more Dynamike; get to rank 20 and above, learn how to master Dyna-Jump, maybe one day get advice from the great Lukiebear, etc. I hope one day that if Supercell made a ‚ÄúBrawl-a-Rama‚Äù show, that at least one thing I gave Dynamike would be in the show.
