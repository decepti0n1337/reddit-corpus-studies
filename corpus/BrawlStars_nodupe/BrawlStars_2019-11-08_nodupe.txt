They might do this but it's not really the time to think about Christmas offers lol
---
---
---
sandy isnt related, the family is leon, nita is the older sister, and bo is the dad
---
Lol
---
I thought it was confirmed by Supercell he isn't.
---
I dont even know. One moment i had 5 powercubes and piper asked me out and i obviously accepted but then 5 minutes later as soon as brock had 8 more powercubes than me, she just hopped in the air towards brock and left me 4 of these weird ball shaped thingies and i picked one up and all of a sudden they blew up and broke my guitar. 
---

---
:(
---
No
---
Do more
---
Love this idea!
---
Thank you!
---
I'm down for a full series of Canine BS
---
Bo is so badass
---
They cant do that. Plus. Its only 2500 tokens lol
---
i could splash down two boxes
---
Hey, your right but  my friend who was the shelly has a way better quality recording
---
I’ve been coining the term Brawl Channels for ages now in peoples requests for this feature on Reddit. Of course we’d love to see it come, and I’m sure it’ll come within a few updates.
---
I make your trophies in one solo match using da capo on poco
---
Same
---
Yeah I’m hoping for it too
---
So am i! Cant you see im like half the size of colt? Im even a bit smaller than penny!
---
But hey that dont mean im not big either ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
That joke is stupid.
---
They trusted you 
---
I did too. 
---
So why in the bloody hell does nita know you?!
---
Jojo Poco!
---
What in the heck
---
That’s awesome dude!
---
White Leon and Nita
---
u/repostsleuthbot do your thing
---
🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😎😎😎😂😂😂😂GUYS OMG LOWER TROPHY PLAYER HAS LEGENDARIES 😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣
---
I played brawl ball with this one good random when I was 3000 trophies
---
they sent me a friend request, and holy moly they were 14K
---
But whenever I requested to join them, they would reject my invitation
---
I'm 18K now and this guy is 19K. They requested me to join them and I rejected them.
---
karma
---
Make sure to call a Shelly with a super, they're really good at tracking Bulls and hunting them.
---
[deleted]
---
I always run my game on my mobile data so I don't have that much lag
---
leon and nita are confirmed cousins
---
I would say crow is annoying but with such little damage, you really can't kill anyone so the only thing you do is chase
---
*Boner activated*
---
Gene is only support, Tara is only skirmisher
---
[removed]
---
So you reposted a meme but you claimed that you did it by putting a watermark, I'm so confused
---
I got my first legendary right after i hit 10k. I am forever more content
---
stop being so greedy, that's an average box
---
you have a friend code or player id w/e? i'll send u an inv, and we can win some matches!
---
what the...
---
and it's also wrong, literally gets one tapped
---
wtf?! she literally gets onetapped
---
Is ur account already maxed out?
---
ur stupid, probably at 10k trophies or something cause no
---
How many total trophies do you have?
---
7687
---
10 outta 10
---
I have very good wifi.  Good service in verizon data.  I live in DC a good location.
---
Witg
---
I’d go for the good luck one, I got Sandy from a free box on my mini.
---
Yeah, but It's not easy to keep a 3+ tile distance with Primo using Bull. I do the same thing, keep 3+ tile distance against Primo when I use Bull, But Bull has LOW damage at that range. It's way better to use Rosa, Primo, Coz Bull has really low damage unless you get into within 2 tile distance. Also, Bull's super makes no sense. You have to charge far distance but it's too far you might miss the target
---
I main bull, bull op,
---
WoooooooooW I never new my post we're trash just kidding as soon as I posted my first skin idea what am I doing this is garbege
---
Or 2k trophies
---
She completely dominates close range combat, and her range is pretty good so you can bring down longer range brawlers. Shelly is definitely a pretty good brawler.
---
Mmm that's hot
---
Dang!!!!!!!!!
---
Congrats, he was my first legendary 8 Months ago
---
So, as it initially dealt damage, Supercell just balanced it to do -400 damage from before, which means it deals 0 damage instead of null damage(which is actually different in a game). That being said, Pipers Ambush adds 800 damage to his super, and 800+0=800, explaining the amount of damage dealt

Ok I can't play rn, but I will add you as soon as I can, see you then! (Btw my game tag is blast burn or something stupid like that)
---
I really like this style, very vibrant
---
Amazing, right?!
---
I recommend a sub called r/shittybrawlstars, it reported the worst posts on this sub
---
Can't really fight back when you try to chase him and he runs away
---
This brawler was made by Taco Otter and Obi-wan canoli, clan Shadow warriors. Please put on trophy road for 7,000.
---
Thanks
---
I really wish I could show you a replay of what happened yesterday
---
Yo add me up I have 12k trophies. Just dm me for my thing to invite me
---
Sadly🌚
---
No. Downvote.
---
1. This whole article is my opinion
---
2. Stop flexing
---
3. I'm saying the whole meta is ruined cuz the dev team keeps buffing crow and then nerfing unnecessary brawlers

Please do. And when you get to Jessie have her playing with her turret!

Just look at all his Instagram posts. He never credits anyone while stealing all kinds of reddit posts. I personally think he deserves to be reported.
---
Im on it!
---
Pick me up mom im scared
---
Thanks!
---
lol, actually original! nice job with the meme
---
NP!! Thx for telling about it
---
Thanks man 5th day on reddit and i already have 100 karma
---
He expected him to be the very best like no one ever was XD
---
Whoaa!!! Thanks a lot!! Glad to read that!!
---
Dont play bull lol
---
A bit late but isn't he a monster ? Like his a zombie
---
Hahhah
---
Thank you, bro!!!
---
That’s not a lot, time and trophy wise.
---
A family, maybe! Hahah
---
Nope.. I drew it.. It took aboit 3 hours
---
I would but i looked at your profile and you have 17k and that’s alot but my code is #GUCUP9GR
---
Yes, they do change during the day. You just get 6 star tokens within a 24 hour period of time. So if you played at 4 PM, got all of the tokens, and then came back at 4 PM the next day, you’d have 6 more to get.
---
With Eagle's Vision? I think he is not!! Hahaha Thank you, friend!!
---
How did u miss TIT
---
Your pretty unlucky hope we get more brawlers
---
Thanks😊
---
That is a point! Who knows? Hahah

?

Hahaha That is our secret!!

Thank you!!! Thanks a lot!!

Low trophy player: 4 legendaries

I'll take two as well

---
Dang dude thx for the awards
---
Nice
---
I Agree!! He is a great fighter too. Think he is my favourite brawler. I say, the brawler that i feel more confortable when i'm playing with
---
Just a hero for fun
---
Thank youu!!!
---
That’s awesome man—I sent a fr
---
Yea, always remember whenever they team theyre accepring the fact that they dont have the skill to win on their own
---
word. almost 900 karma for the oldest and least funny jokes in the book. besides, people with only 2K probably aren't in high enough trophy ranges to encounter teamers and thus wouldn't be likely to team themselves.
---
It’s literally a walking barrel with shotguns, how are you guys extrapolating this ?
---
Yeah i gtg to sleep now its been nice talking to you
---
Yeah man cya✌️
---
Well, that is from my room's light... If you look the drawing in real time, you will see that they are not haha
---
Good question!!
---
My name says it all
---
Where's Lil Helper Penny?
---
Since Power Play came out I have not seen anything else on Brawl TV even a single time.
---
You lie that you buy gold, actually is night
---
It’s much better and pixelated
---
Oh ok I guess, but still, he is limited edition you get that chance once.
---
Exact situation for me, just pulled him last Wednesday and almost pissed myself until I realized that he would probably get nerfed again
---
Yea its a stupid thing but ok
---
If the Bull is close enough to deal significant damage he’ll be unloading his shots quickly. Drop a bear with Bear With Me, Bull takes a bit to kill Bruce, and in that time Nita both heals a bit and deals some extra damage.
---
aToMiC cHaRgE!
---
Eh icy decolation
---
agree.they are breaking game
---
They're all pixelated...
---
Oh..
---
This a trash scam
---
The bit and piper was shit but ok
---
Yeah it's amazing
---
Are you talking to me or OP
---
NOBODY CAN JUST DEFLECT THE EMERALD BOUNCE
---
Hahaha. That describes a lot of people. Me, Ima at 13k and only one legendary
---
World end is here...
---
Waow, so cuteee 😍😍😍😋😘😘😘😘😘😘😘
---
Leon mains are the most oppressed group in this community
---
*Right after Bull*
---
I got 8 gems in back to back boxes
---
Hmmmm
---
noob u cant even play defense
---
Hmmmm to you too bud
---
I got 40 token doublers (-:

Yeah in you life

Man, thats something to think of

Congrats! I'm also mad!

I mean, who the fuck upvoted that

Keep this shitty circle jerk to r/mortisgang please

Crow...as a crow...
---
Flair checks out
---
So...you drew a drawing in a drawing?
---
That guys an asshole others just say that there higher than you and leave you alone but calling you fucking stupid is such a bull move
---
That sucks lol
---
That's true, I agree. They should stop complaining about the nerf. When spike had fertilizer, no ome complained.
---
I switched for a different comment after the one i made 25 m ago so that works
---
Back in the day
---
14k and I haven't opened up a single legendary...
---
Ok
---
True :))))
---
Bo isn’t their father but they’re from the same tribe
---
Okay maybe 7 seconds nvisibility and smoke trails infreased bosst from 24% 26% the damage buff can be from 616 to 650 (now is not much  and is enough) also other balance ideas
---
8 bit speed increased to 650 tiles per second
---
Damage per bem decreased to 550 
---
Extra life  respamn shield time decreased to 1 second
---
r/neverbrokeabone AND YOU KNOW IT

reee

Wow Just WOW! Amazing

Hello,its yr top local player Prime 😳
---
I knew it cuz i saw your name change haha
---
Heres’s my id if you wanna check it out #2220QQ9RP
---
Upvote Tara is also something else. veeery fast
---
No they’re not just because someone uses this star power and complains about it being nerfed doesn’t mean they’re trash or they rely on it some people genuinely like this star power so stop being a jerk
---
Хпхпхпхпхпхпхпхпхпхпхпхпхпхпхпхпхпхпхпхпхпхпхпхпхпхпхпхахпхпхпх
---
Can you draw barley as a bottle
---
Ok mabey not but how can you love a sp that gives 90% chance to hit somone when you're spamming shots
---
Jsyk everyone the original skin idea was made by u/memesthememes and he asked if he could make a concept for the skin so don’t go yelling at them or else you’ll be found stupid
---
r/antimeme
---
What happens at level 10
---
firts
---
yes
---
Haha thanks man xDD
---
Legend.
---
Star power
---
And sc gives you less coins than power points
---
Thanks man xD
---
This is the only ship I can get behind
---
*Insert roundabout from Yes*
---
Also nice golden mecha Crow
---
Wow really? Then there are these 1k ones who already have one or two legies
---
 I feel like this is stolen cause someone is doing brawlers as shapes
---
That should be someone’s super, like they can see farther than normal, like Bos star power
---
He probably bought it with chips when it was epic or found him when they turned him super rare
---
Tara is Sandy’s mother
---
Nice drawings but wth he looks like one of these ninja turtles.
---
No hate
---
because the subreddit generally has low standards
---
You get it and the brawler goes to level 10 automatically?
---
It’s not that people changed their minds (although I’m sure some did) but rather that the only people who said anything were the ones who thought it should be nerfed. Now they aren’t saying much, but instead all the people who thought it was fine as it was are talking about how bad it is.
---
Please do something about these players
---
Beautiful
---
I got Leon at 650 trophies 🌚
---
Tryna make it 1k while level6 haha
---
The painful truth.
---
Thanks to my friends they made me install brawl stars, i hated it now look at me with 11k trophies and star shelly
---
Spikes attack but with more range and more chip shots doing less damage. If direct contact is made then it just does one set number of damage. Super would be a healing station the team can go to to heal. Lasts 6 seconds and has 2000 health
---
Ya
---
I love this

r/EmogiPolice

Yay

See? I think he shoul go see a doctor or sumin. Hes just seeing things now.

You deserve it mate. Keep on drawing
---
Me too! They have comfirmed that Leon and Nita are brothers, Dad Bo is not so far away from this
---
Hey it's okay. I have 7.5k and i started playing in March 2019 and still no legy's and Emz and i have 25 brawlers so be happy with what you have😀

Hahahah Glad u liked it!! Thanks!!!

Hehe you fell into my trap of BO MINES 7000 damage
---
Holy shit we are getting you on coach cory,  this is amazing!!!
---
Thank you!! Hahah xD
---
Players like that deserve an Insta ban, if only it was a thing
---
Great idea but there would be certain modes with no viewers so eh
---
They’re all pretty underwhelming. Emz is super easy to deal with and Mortis is a joke. They all suck at dealing with mid to long range brawlers and the current meta and balance puts high damage and long range brawlers at the top.
---
Whoa! Impressive!
---
University of New South Wales
---
Great drawing but it highlights how ridiculous Bo's hat is now. He looks like a wannabe/bad cosplayer rather than a real native american hunter.
---
Nice 👌

Exactly like this post :)

Только русский прочитал правильно xD

Someone already posted this

Lol everyone has star shelly
---
And I just got the star power a few days ago. Thank you very much Supercell, much appreciated.
---
Isn't that ironic
---
Yea I kinda used it...🤫
---
You didnt expect that i have 1UP star power, do ya?? Hahaha
---
That actually freaked me out
---
I am creator
---
Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm. Darn.
---
Hahaha Thanks!! I like to see them as a family, taking care off each other! Gives an extra meaning to the game and characters!
---
For sure! Hahaha
---
lmao he changed his flair to tara
---
I will! You can bet!! Leave it to me!
---
OOPS
---
Thanks for enlightening me
---
Wait....... It could be Shelly's fault to
---
That’s the joke bruh
---
Well,have a nice day))
---
Yea, so their arguement is weak. Because if they think it is broken and it's like cheating to use it. They shouldnt use it until it gets balanced. But nope, complain it is op but still use it everytime. Who would listen to that kind of arguement. It's like a smoker telling you smoking is bad. Would you care?
---
There’s a town not far from where I live called Ararat. Wonder if anyone here’s from there.

---
Bro &amp; I will support your regardless. Real recognize real! Always pursue your passions man! Feel free to use anything
---
do you have both star powers for shelly? if no then upgrade something else. primo has to rely a lot teammates due to short range.
---
Yeah I do
---
Every day i go there..
---
I see their faces
---
''now kids get a laso and get him over her e I'll finish the rest''
---
then you should upgrade so you don't miss out on star powers.
---
Well. One thing i know is that they cant revert purchases
---
This doesn't mean anything. It's just luck. I got piper at 1k and Tara at 3k. But I got Leon and Crow at 6k. So just look forward to your next Megaboxes !
---
You're making absolutely no sense
---
And it's still very hard to play downward since your fingers will hinder the bottom screen as well! I hate it every time I spawn at the top :/
---
See you on the front page 🔥💯
---
Lucky block...
---
Ah that makes sense
---
it is probably the stupidest comment of the thread
---
There're also your fingers hindering the screen.. Is it playable? Yes. Is it fair? Incredibly no. If they both have equal skill, the bottom one clearly has upper hand.
---
Only real use for this is in heist. Literally ignore most enemies. Get a bear.throw it at the safe and the health will go really really fast
---
The animation is so smooth, very well done
---
What
---
Yeah she is very op. Very few brawlers can actually counter. You cant run away and you cant get close fast enough to kill.
---
Yeah I did, thank you
---
If EMZ runs away too then you don't catch up and get caught in max damage from her 3 sprays
---
That looks like my random teammates

Always checking de bushes is the rule of surviving

Why I want this map?

Great idea!

Hahah Thankss!! Glad you liked it!

those are star points, not star tokens
---
I see a fellow Vietnamese player whoop!

Yes you are right

Let me analyse this picture. Shelly is angry at Bibi for starting the school shooting and Bo just gave up because no even the spirits would help him today

Rip curveball

OK I AGREE WITH YOURS COMMENS

Don't worry.. I will join you, soon XD

what is a "SpaceStation Clan**"** ?

Why do U think u posted it 😉

High effort meme! Take my upvote man!
---
Hahaha yeah! Today in showdown i dont killed a Bull and in the end of the game he was in the bush and surprised me... i finished in second because that i let he lives hahah
---
Same XD
---
I do actually agree, I think most of the maps that come up for lone star are all long range maps, therefore if you want to actually enjoy playing it ur kind of forced to use the medium-long range brawlers making the variety of the game mode pretty low. It’s just boring to play
---
#Sherry
---
yAs oF cOrsE
---
I think it’s just frustrating because of the killsteals.
---
Yeah, that’s why I made this
---
What they should do is contact the creator of the image they took inspiration from, and pay them in gems so that they can make them skin with permission. It's a great way of including fan creators in the community while at the same time making badass skins. No more Caveman Frank and Nightwitch Mortis that nobody asked for.
---
It ok i just noticed it its quite interesting
---
Does it matter whether I constantly use it? It’s a feature that has an annoying, useless thing that happens, why not fix it?
---
Wait, that's illegal
---
lol
---
I quite like it, as I have Leon
---
Nope, Polish
---
Please dont use emojis on Reddit
---
How do you guys not love Kill Steal, I mean, Lone Star? Instead of getting frustrated chasing a robot, now you can frustrated chasing other people! Hooray!
---
really takedown, :| r u the player who attacks everyyyone instead of boss? HMM btw i see lonestar in ur chosen battle tho i have tip:- 
---
1. Never ever attack someone when u see anybody who is ready to steal ur kil or be the third party and kill u both!
---
2. try to be hidden to suddenly pounce upon someone. 
---
3. Try to go more pressurized area as kairos means pressurized area by people in a particular are.
---
4. go from bush to bush in search of prey
---
5. if someone catches and act like u didnt see him he will be ready to pounce upon but u know he is there so act innocent and as soon as he pounce just do ur thing or pounce on him before
---
6. If that brawler is stronger than you and you have no chance or a little chance to win then do one thing RUN! 
---
7. Always choose ur prey smartly cuz being dumb will make u lose. ex- being dyna going to kill mortis where walls is less and u r low xp with him/being mortis going to kill shelly with a super or bull or darryl on their full health when u have low xp with mortis.
---
If u need help with me, tell me ur  username and here is my tag, friend me-#2RYURCYGR(UV,club-Zappy Branez) and pls reply me on reddit to look out for your username in friend invites. So i can

Took me a year and a half to get my first legendary 😅
---
Hakuna Matata = What's yours is mine
---
Absolute truth I guess he just bought it from the shop and trolling us
---
Hi
---
No it isnt. Its confirmed to be a strategy and a Bull will kill Mortis easily
---
What’s interesting about this? You just taunted someone who had less power ups then you? ok?
---
Me, who opened 1000s of boxes and and still no legendary after 20k trophies: what the frick Spercell?!
---
🦀🦀High effort art🦀🦀
---
I don't like it tho
---
You just bought the brawler from the shop and trying to troll us NOOB
---
I actually like takedown. I do think the robot should get that shield thingy on a set time.
---
I dont like it too but it is useful
---
Very good
---
I hate Leon in lone star, they always steal my kills :p.
---
WoW
---
Perfect Screenshot 👌
---
Rico: dude it’s NNN
---
Is credit needed?
---
The most legitimate silver giver I know
---
That's because the way to showcase skins in shop has changed, the characters are actually rendered but with no animations, they forgot to remove blinks but maybe it was left intentionally, I dont know
---
xd
---
if a thrower she will be like dyna and if sharpshooter then like brock.THO great art! keep it up
---
Nice one
---
Huh, ok
---
How are we supposed to use that format if there are the name. And to top it all, you spelt mortis wrong (nothing major. Only wrong i) otherwise, good job!
---
I don't know why but it only shows with safari ...
---
Eh but when you team...
---
I literally have 1 skin in the shop every day ...
---
Who remembers when Nita used to throw out that rectangle bear treat thingy?
---
Let me guess... Golden Mecha Bo?
---
is that really true or just photoshop ?
---
It wastes supercells time, its just 5 seconds! Why should they worry about that instead of actually BALANCING the game?
---
xD i love mortis but I don't think it's the best idea.
---
*heh...heheheh
---
Shpuld be i have a hat
---
You’ll get one soon
---
Oh, thank

I love tick 😍
---
Um... ItS vErY goOd

i WilL lOvE tO See IT In gAme

Buffing his health would defeat the purpose of him having low health but annoying to deal with. He isn’t meant to be a tank
---
I have 1

Rosa XD
---
Well... wow
---
I didn't team up with rico. He tried to team up with them.

I had never teamed up not even once.

You killed my species!! Waa
---
If you tell me your ID, sure.
---
5 seconds, times every player every time they use it.
---
Want it?
---
Who hasn't
---
Mortis is good even without hat :)
---
Yeah a good idea you should make that pam needs a skin.
---
No its not
---
If you’ve truly played with spikes you should know that without curveball spike is a very strong brawler. You should also know that curveball did indeed need a nerf because it covered way too much distance. I have spike maxed, I know how broken curveball was because I have both star powers for him. Even with fertilizer you can do really good if you use your star power with skill. Every time I played curveball it was just unfair to other players. Honestly this just seems like you don’t know what you’re talking about.
---
I have mortis!!
---
But people arent gonna use it 24/7 its only a feature if you want to test out brawlers
---
Eh maybe swushy bushy
---
yeaa i am, cause i just comment this post not once, but twice now, so yeaaaa
---
T H I C C
---
But you spined
---
Is this a "i dont have a legendary" joke
---
That's the point, i understand the nerf, but now spike will be less used, cause u can twoshot him ezz. He rlly needs a buff in the hit points or in shooting speed tho.
---
Low effort meme.
---
WTF
---
Youre so unlucky
---
*PEOPLE SINCE GLOBAL STILL CRYING*
---
Leon going down

Brock:first time

Our lord and savior callmecarson

Hahahahahahahhahahahhahahhahahhahah

hEY LooK ITs A tHroWeR, Oh wAIt ItS A PoWEr CubE
---
He's fine as he is. He's already pretty strong if you use him right.
---
I was thinking that too so maybe just the damge of the three bombs collectively
---
So good x'D
---
wait there are 4 legendarys ?
---
Everybody in my country does it
---
**YOU ATE ALL MA BEANS NIBBA!!!**
---
No you are not, this is brawl stars in Minecraft, not Minecraft in brawl stars.
---
So we back in the mine
---
Yeah
---
I thought he would help me but for now I will not spin
---
Dont beg for upvotes
---
Emm... Just save it? Then use anyway you want
---
same thing with band aid
---
At least you have an invisible nick
---
if you put a hashtag in front of a word, it will be like that
---
No i haven't. Cool👌
---
I hate friendlies in tf2 so much. Somehow someway I end up dying because I tried not to hurt them. I like teaming in Brawlstars though.
---
"Early draws are predetermined to ensure a fair start for everybody"... nice job Supercell
---
I didnt know anything and bought el primo
---
How many accounts did it take?
---
But those are just memes. They're there to spread joy and laughter.
---
Translate.
---
Nightmare fuel
---
Why you, why not me?! 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
---
Do you guys think crows white crow skin will change? It’s very basic and honestly a worse skin then the regular crow.
---
You know a meme is shitty when op doesn't even see his meme before posting it
---
They may have legendaries, but nothing changes the fact that you're legendary and they are not :)
---
How many comments do each post get?
---
But i have 2
---
Yea but it's nice to kick back in a friendly server after an intense match.
---
Agree
---
It's fake. Look at the flair
---
Look at the flair

It's fake, look at the flair

It has gotten 100 upvotes in 5 hours
---
You’re literally talking shit about someone over a mobile game. You probably feel really proud of your self considering your low standards for everything.
---
#I AGREE
---
Delete you account.
---
This is what I initially thought Emz was. But alas, she is but a vcso girl
---
8-Bit would say so.
---
That should’ve counted as a goal more than half the ball was in.
---
Yeah? And what if I took your posts just like "a bad random compilation" and posted it on YouTube and other social networks without giving you any credit? Is it still a joke that someone tried to spread to brighten someone's day or a steal of someone's honest work? Still funny?
---
It had 10 when I said it :p
---
Tbh this art shit
---
bruh
---
Yeah, overall it was a bad analogy for the game, but I just had to point out the awful logic lol.
---
Are you kidding me I in 12k and without a legendary!
---
Pretty much the only playstyle TBH
---
Respect
---
Noice
---
You can get 3 rares by your 36th by supercell iding to get barley
---
Crow remodel? I like crow :(
---
If you want to team then play in DUO. I hate teamers. There is no skill involved in teaming it’s just taking advantage, cheating and bullying other players. If your brawlers are ranking up from teaming just know it’s not because you’re skilled at the game it’s because you can’t win without cheating. No skills.
---
I'm not upset about curve ball Because that shit is sadistic
---
wait what? that makes no since and i didn't say that. i think you meant why didn't i say that
---
No. If someone on the internet reposts your artwork/video, he HAS to give credit. If it is just a meme then he doesn't have to, but it is still okay for him to credit OP.
---
They're just memes, and it's not like they're viral. lol
---
Also if someone wants credit, wellllll technically you need to have legal ownership of the material
---
it's the internet what do you expect mayne.
---
you have betrayed us
---
For anyone really concerned about this, this is an edited pic, you can see that the sort system is rarity so crow should be first. Hope i Don't get wooshed
---
Yes, i do
---
Oops
---
Yes,
---
(Below 400 trophies so cant send replay)
---
Yes, but actually no.
---
HEY 🅱️ORTIS
---
I am not sure about that but Pumba also steals some artworks from reddit
---
Well done
---
You're spinning him
---
Could've has also replaced it with Mortis, or Darryl, or Rosa,....
---
Can you just...
---
#*no?*
---
Nice#
---
Actually you spun before that. Right in the beginning you spun and he reciprocated. Then he tried to kill you but unfortunately was unsuccessful. You spun first.
---
Any link?
---
Why do I care?
---
I'll look for it, I'll share the link if I find it
---
Okay, whenever you feel as if you want a chat, I’m always here I just might not reply straight away :)
---
Yeah, but before powerplay, it wasn't any good either, 80% of the time you got duo showdown
---
Except crow. He is supercells favorite
---
This is actually very offensive as it references several genocides such as the holocaust.

---
That's right and actually if you get into those shitty YouTubers mind, there clickbaits are so fucked up.
---
In my opinion the best and only YouTuber for this specific thing is JK YouTube.
---
Oh shoot you're right
---
Holy crap it's the Heavy
---
Love how the blurred everything
---
F for Curveball before the big nerf
---
I have 12k trophies, top 20 poco every season and still no legendary
---
I made a other with help of the comments
---
Your post has been removed, make sure to use the body of a post to elaborate on the title.
---
Yeah I agree with the last part
---
Who actually uses demolition if they have the option to use dyna jump? Seriously, you can legit jump around whenever you like. Demolition is trash.
---
i think this is a great map for everyone!
---
that is sooooo cool
---
Let's settle this beef
---
Thats how u/PixelArt01 works
---
For about 2.6 seconds I thought this was a design of Mortis default dancing
---
Not using the brawlstars version D:
---
Sorry
---
How are you supposed to get your super?
---
there's a pinned post in r/brawlmaps that mentions the map making rules
---
I don't know how how the tag and capitalization is not getting into people's head.

Lesson here is don’t use unsupported characters. You’ll have to use gems to change your name.

You are correct, this person is a scammer.

Talking lemon was my clan mate he good but I think he is doing this for skins 🤕 I'm in synergy anarchy @shravil
---
Poor spike..
---
😂He or she sent me a friend request
---
In my country, Summer is coming...
---
This is the best brawl stars video I ever seen
---
Damn
---
Yesh he is asking for upvotes kids these days totally gotta agree with you
---
How did you know I use Reddit? (:
---
I like how you put loaded Rico and el Rey in the background
---
He’s talking about clip compilations
---
Cool but since when is leon white racism going around here boys 🙄
---
I tried with different styles and they were invisible when it says to write confirm, and only 2 styles were visible,I selected the one I liked but apparently it didn't work
---
We*
---
What???
---
Same thing happened to me but I got crow. I have all the legendaries on my main though
---
Thank u for telling me this, i feel reliefed
---
oh...
---
Doing this rn, i chose reddit after i finished pushing frank
---
I know Jews who find the Holocaust funny
---
he also played agar.io but he now steals brawl stars clips for views
---
Oh that would be interesting, I misunderstood
---
Yes. Wish I thought of that sooner XD
---
Me at morning*
---
Pleas die
---
Hack
---
Ha good one!
---
Let me ask u a question. What if your sibling "accidentally" cuts off the wifi and u lose 20 trophies? I guess accidents happen.
---
Huh... wow. That is the exact same thing that I saw on my acc...
---
*supercell why you killed spike*
---
Random! Here's a little lesson in plants and dirt. Fertilizer makes it stronger all around
---
*hey, dont touch that!*
---
BULLSHIT
---
My thoughts exactly
---
Seems the most likely to me
---
StAr PlAyEr
---
I got Leon like 4 months after I started playing, and Spike 4 months later. It's the two only legendaries I got so far. Been playing for 10 months and I'm at 16k trophies. I got all power points for the 28 brawlers I have, only missing most star powers.
---
*laughs in wizard barley with 2 fingers
---
I think my friend code is #QL9GULUP I have 6 brawlers very high
---
Cool beans
---
Mass Tickocide
---
I wish that would happen to me with Shelly 😭
---
Everyone use fertilize so they reverse the nerf, at least a bit
---
Noice I'm at 9700 throphies
---
That’s sad
---
I just downvoted your post.
---
FAQ
---
What does this mean?
---
The amount of karma (points) on your comment and Reddit account has decreased by one.
---
Why did you do this?
---
There are several reasons I may deem a comment to be unworthy of positive or neutral karma. These include, but are not limited to:
---
•	⁠Rudeness towards other Redditors,
---
•	⁠Spreading incorrect information,
---
•	⁠Sarcasm not correctly flagged with a /s.
---
Am I banned from the Reddit?
---
No - not yet. But you should refrain from making comments like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.
---
I don't believe my comment deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?
---
Sure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.
---
How can I prevent this from happening in the future?
---
Accept the downvote and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on Reddit.com. I will continue to issue downvotes until you improve your conduct. Remember: Reddit is privilege, not a right.
---
First box. Really? Do you not understand it?
---
Sometimes. I do but when they are respawning I shoot the ball and an enemy respawns looking at what I did
---
I feel like she only needed a nerf to her unload speed. That was insanely annoying to battle when you couldnt escape her
---
If you check my profile, I have a screenshot of talking with supercell about it.
---
Did you used Gene? Nice. I see you got hurt by sniper bot
---
hope they make a new cool animation for crow his current animation looks boring compared to other brawlers animations
---
What did you expect, getting every  brawler or what?
---
Then go with barley
---
Right now it's just a thumbs up lmao. It definitely needs a remodel

It's cool bro, In English it is shelly

Ooooh I get it. Nice. I wish I had a bank credit card to but things online
---
Omg Polpo achieved heaven
---
Has anyone tried the current reporting system by reporting brawl ball players that score their own goals? I'm curious if that ever worked. I'm guessing the support team can review replays of the player reporting it but I'm not sure.
---
This is the closest picture of Sandy being awake...and he's probably just stopping his alarm clock.
---
Probably brawlers they want to upgrade at least
---
(Do it again)

Its been 2 months xd
---
Probably Photoshop, or the other 1-5 , 7-19 and 21-35 th boxes can give brawlers aswell
---
Cuz he’s good
---
Did you record the whole thing being done?
---
Bibi doesn’t have a skin
---
Hmm, dude I agree that he is the 2nd best leg, also not gna argue with the fact that he’s pretty op in general composition, and so op in BB. But u hv to agree that spike is a preferred target in showdown, mainly cause of his low health. Dude u know that there’s no fair showdown lol never, and Spike is always an easy target to gang up, is not always your skill, cause u can be very good but u are not Neo to get ur ass out of a corner bein shot by 3players at the same time —‘, or two, u really just need to take one shot, them wat? Gona matrix the other guys with just one shot of health? Come on man 😂 
---
Regarding the nerf, hv to say that until the update I will stuck with that bitch just to remember how OP that starpower once was 🤣🙌
---
*26*
---
it will not get added cause of 1 tile gaps and also water got removed from brawl ball cause the ball will get stucked in it
---
I also play Rocket League
---
Bloodlust be like:
---
I' mean that leon get worse and brock is now the worst right now and the worst brawler for gem grab and brawl ball brock just needed small damage buff to 1680 is not much and is not going to make brock op also also for leon here is balance ideas l
---
1. invisaheal decreased healing from 1000 to 600
---
2.imcreased invisibility to 7 seconds 
---
3. Damage per blade increased to 650 per blade at close range
---
Also for 8 bit 
---
Decreased damage per beam to 375 
---
Decreased invisibility shield when using extra life to 1 second 
---
Increased reload speed to 1,7 seconds 
---
Increased speed to 660 tiles per hour
---
I only need 2 brawlers... gene and Leon
---
He is 7th right now on Coach Cory's one:  [https://tournament.brawlstars.com/event/705](https://tournament.brawlstars.com/event/705) He don't deserve anything. Go solo gamemode or just make a new account and fill that with your 3rd teammate. This is awefull
---
Shut up
---
When I first got poco I thought he acted like Shelly where it did more damage the closer to the target so I just rushed people as a poco lmao
---
Wat?
---
Boy, I need to sit down.
---
definitely used the cheat sheet
---
I got coiled snake right after the day it got nerfed
---
Noobs flexing legandary while us pros got skill no matter wat
---
Tap this,its much quicker.

Weakest:  No

Honestly Curveball was too OP and deserved it's nerf... it was just brainless free hits and impossible to dodge
---
That’s a Choice you made you can just wait it out nd you’ll get another eventually
---
Why would you give Leon a damage buff?  Besides bull he all ready does the most damage at close range and his shots are easy to hit and it is really easy to get up clos using his ult and it’s easy to charge his ult with long range low dmg attacks , I like the first buff but a damage buff would make Leon op
---
Also Brock is kinda good imo he’s my second highest trophy brawler
---
I use a app and the railway can you set in the map
---
*I don’t no now if this is true or not, but I’m too lazy to check so...*

Que bueno

Keep it blank not many players have such a name
---
Then, and cause I’m not a pro, if u hv the time, pls see my latest post in my profile, n leave some tips on how I can improve tho, tks in advnc 🤙
---
Can you please stop
---
Yeah BS is the initials for the game
---
if that was curveball spike before the update he wouldve been done
---
Hat
---
Just gonna say that’s impossible
---
Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no..., oh YEEAAHHH

So let the people who DO have fun? Why should people who pay have to stop just cause some can't?

There are just barley power points
