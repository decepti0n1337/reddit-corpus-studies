Yea. So u gain +4 for first, +2 for second, and 0 for third if you are at 1200+ trophies. Its all downhill from 3rd.

Try doing cleaner lineart and make the skirt longer

Agreed

Hey, winning‚Äôs winning.

aww man

I had an account do this but with Barley.

Lone star yes but I‚Äôm nasty at takedown

r/shittybrawlstars
---
Flair checks out
---
THANK YOU SO MUCH ;;  
---
I don't post much stuff on reddit exactly because this shit always happens! I'm really thankful for you looking out for these stealers.
---
He‚Äôs a gemmer, bud.
---
&gt; you have more trophies you‚Äôve probably opened more boxes as you‚Äôve played more and got more tokens so uhh
---

---
Very flawed. You can only get a maximum of 2 boxes per day (4 with token doublers) and a bigger box per 2 days. 
---
If you play more, you don't necessarily open more boxes. You can't infinitely grind them.
---
If you got your 200 tokens for the day, and keep on playing... Yes, you will get trophies. No, you won't get more boxes.
---
how is this cursed? the image is too vague

Damn, that‚Äôs a cool map!

---
I find it to be one of my favorite modes rn to be honest
---
Fair enough
---
It‚Äôs fun to be competing against the others
---
Flair does not check out.
---
I have a 0.146 legendary chance with 0 legendaries. I‚Äôve only missed about 5 days worth of tokens since global release, so it‚Äôs not due to missing boxes for me.
---
Your chance can also go down due to pulling mythics, so I think a lot of the time it just comes down to bad luck as far as the timing of that too. You can pull a mythic just as your legendary chance gets high
---
That‚Äôs a bug.
---
Nice
---
Anytime!! You‚Äôre my favorite artist, and I definitely wouldn‚Äôt let this go unnoticed. I know a lot of posts get stolen on Reddit, and I completely understand why you don‚Äôt post so much on here anymore. I try to stop as many art thieves as I can, sadly there‚Äôs too many of them. I hope you‚Äôre doing well, and I hope that none of your art gets stolen again shsgshsbs.
---
Niceeeee
---
I'm sry I had to downvote so you have 69 upvotes

Finally someone sane at least

I found it at first in December

When you pass the ball and the random misses an open shot
---
Give him a glove and an elvis hat
---
I miss this meme
---
Amazing comeback
---
No duh
---
no mythics... at 11k. WOW you are one unlucky person
---
yep, starts to get harsh near 1000, but that‚Äôs to be expected
---
Someone give this man an award
---
That is ridiculous
---
Mortis dashed right as he grabbed the ball so the game registered him having the ball but then dashing so instead of him dashing with the ball he dropped it. There wasn't enough time for mortis to throw the ball since he had already clicked the attack button. (My Guess)
---
Try me
---
wow! your drawing skills are magnificent. we need more of this is r/Brawlstars
---
What can I say except that treason?
---
r/woooosh
---
Any mode except BB and showdown tbh.
---
Teaming with yourself
---
No, we‚Äôll be QUICKLY killed. You‚Äôre the ones dying slowly.
---
Most players also don‚Äôt create premade teams, so without a good comp, Mortis can be a waste of space.
---
God I loved this meme
---
If he is trash in brawl ball explain all these YouTubers doing videos about him in brawl ball?
---
Well then ignore everything I've said
---
Umm crow actually seriously needed that damage buff...
---
Mine is close to that
---
I am almost at 6k and I have Leon And Crow but frank is my only epic and I have no mythics
---
No she was not
---
snappy sniping right?
---
But I find +10 trophies to be very exciting
---
He said that memes are photoshopped iirc
---
Damn crow came to kill me after i spared him since i felt bad for walking into him at point blank so i just got my super and left, he gets the energy drink to come after me and dies, wish he would have been better than that
---
Ikr cause he stole his daddy‚Äôs money
---
he is was 4th most used over 700 trophies and he still had very low win rate. and most of the mortis are just randoms/liabilities who don't hop in with tankkillers
---
That‚Äôs what I though first tooüòÇ
---
^Person why did it  :)
---
I did another postangen in English after noticing the error =)
---
then why are you complaining
---
Ablablahah
---
OwO
---
Well yes but actually no
---
can't kill tanks.
---
no knockback or stun to remove the ball.
---
0 range.
---
 
---
can't stop other ball carriers 
---
hops around with ball forcing his teammates to fight 2v3.

Trophies don‚Äôt matter, about a month after they are upgraded is about average

What happened is by pure chance those 3 were put together, maybe only 2, which turned into 3, and then they all agreed to play.

As a Mortis main Mortis is not great and requires skill but even still you must be smart with how you play him cause he‚Äôs definitely not the best brawler

If you want to use somebody‚Äôs art give them credit. Also this can be taken down as stolen art.

He just wants good karma and attention.
---
Maybe nice
---
Mine was 0.37 before i got sandy
---
No one
---
But Mortis won't stand a chance against Bulls and Shellys.
---
Idk if its nice
---
He aint op. If u think hes op ur just bad at the game. Its easy to counter him if you know how to predict where enemies would go.

So, can I post it there?

I guess you're the dumbest person alive hence Leon is a real name that people have.
---
I don't say what –ë–õ–≠–¢ is a bad word, i said –ë–õ#–¢–¨ is a bad word
---
EVERYONE JOIN LEONGANG PLEASE... he got no voice and no family Maybe.
---
mortis is certainly not the best everywhere, but he is absolutely not the worst brawler. he is a very solid pick in gem grab and bounty.
---
But if the Shelly can react faster then there is no escape from the super chain
---
Sandy is broken. Carl, Gene and Bibi certainly weren't broken.
---
*starts sweating with leon at 9k*
---
Hello how are you
---
Looks like there's a wire going around an outline. (not to offend)
---
Every pro including the world finals participants thinks he's op. But I suppose they're all bad at the game. You're just a noob who doesn't understand game mechanics and think you're special for beating players using Sandy wrongly.

I‚Äôve pushed barley from 400 to 600 only doing takedown.  You don‚Äôt have to farm cubes at all, just only attack the boss and you‚Äôll get top 3 every time

Nice piece of work

Lol I used a pen to draw the lines... I used pencil to shade. It looks stupid without any shading.

LOL

Dude they still cost a lot

Yeah but if you farm power cubes you get first every time

Thank you very much üòä

Don‚Äôt ask upvotes
---
Not in high trophies because others kill the boss too fast for that crappy strategy to work
---
Doesn't mean much, "most players" also walk straight towards enemies while autoaiming, "most players" also don't know how to juke, "most players" also don't know when to stick to their lanes or not take gems while using an aggro brawler. 
---
Sandy has by far the highest median trophies among top players. In the recent NA finals, he was played in every game and mode by both sides. (Except one of the bounty games, the side that didn't use Sandy lost).
---
WoAh
---
Im to lazy to argue so i just agree

Where you find this information?

Hey your not too bad, UNLIKE CROW

I know the actual chance doesn‚Äôt change

Your wish is my command

By the help of Carl and Dynamike

Play him at over 800 trophies and tell me if he's still as OP as you think.

At least we better then Instagram bullcrap

I got him yesterday and there are many problems with him and he definitely needs a buff
---
yeah, like how do you buff luck
---
But having all the other brawlers makes it easier to get the newest one. I had about 350 boxes saved for Sandy and got him after about 300. I just hope the October brawler isn't mythic, I don't think I'll have very many boxes when that one comes out. But every rarity has 4 brawlers except mythic...

Sandy being OP is not an opinion. anyone who thinks he is balanced is bad at the game or in denial. there is no room for argument.

Before brawl ball Mortis dominated because there was no ammo use with dribbling the ball, now he‚Äôs not b a d, however many brawlers outclass him now in this mode

Look at kairos times New video so u Will understand

I get it's a joke, but I have to say that sandy is actually balanced, and that its surprising we got a balanced character on its launch. People are over here saying Carl and Gene were balanced- but hell nah. Bibi was alright, and Rosa was a little strong, but got made entirely useless by the way they nerfed her. The only broken part about Sandy is his star powers, but in a way that they have to nerf the super instead of the star powers, making base sandy slightly worse.
---
YES.
---
The "skilled" part is the problem
---
I think you nailed it. The healing is good but it‚Äôs much more comp specific. I vastly prefer rude sands overall.

---
Commit death

Hw reminds me of a samurai from some random Anime.
---
