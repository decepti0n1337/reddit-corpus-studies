Looks like exe.

I like exe.

I like this

Nice

That‚Äôs not my experience at all. You end up a Power cube (sometimes 2!) up, you got a fast kill and you got an ult out of it. I backstab *all* the time, I‚Äôm 11.5K with 1300 showdown wins. 
---
Actually backstabbing is probably better than teaming. 
---
Friendly games exist...
---
Alladin :D
---
Lmao i suck so idk how to create a sub kill me.-.
---
How did you get so many token doublers?
---
Man i went from getting like a 100 trophy to 10-15 a day...(im at 1.9k atm, very little ik ;-;)

I like ur idea, but u wouldn't get any reward right?
---
Crow: 1176 if u hit three daggers + poison= 1568. 1568x2 = 3126. 3126 =\= 5040.
---
Thats my point lol
---
I said "if matchmaking if based on level, whats the point of leveling up a brawler?"
---
That isn't my review
---
All of this is irrelevant, I never flipped a coin.
---
Being boss stays at 1/6 no matter how many times you play. You can‚Äôt win this argument, sorry.
---
Cool
---
Exe? 
---
Executioner. Clash royale?
---
Oof
---
Yeah what the heck riot! üìå
---
ITS THE SAME THING 1/6 IS LIKE 1/2 COIN ITS THE SAME EXACT THING YOU CAN SUB H AND T FOR B (boss) AND P (player) BUT THE ODDS OF IT HAPPENING ARE LOWER
---
NOW STOP BEING DEGENERATED THERE IS NO WAY ANY HUMAN WITH A BRAIN COULDNT GET IT BY NOW
---
There will be less tanks in higher trophies match 
---
Hey look an original joke
---
It's a shit bro, don't lose your time. I'm brazilian and this only exists cause dumbs still watch it, and it's losing its popularity through the years
---
Truthful statement (buff Crow)
---
Cool. I got my lvl 4 gene to 420 in a day
---
lol i just decline them with no hesitation
---
&gt;Pingo can swim in the water
---
*Cries in* ***cReAtUrE oF tHe NiGht***
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
i did that too
---
Even for me at 9.3k after I jz unlocked gene. There are only bo and gene in sd lol 
---
Absolutely
---
Its because Crow has the smallest hit box in the game...
---
Of course not, i just think if tickets arent easy to get you can at least test some characters, i would love to try say, colt or poco but im not wasasting tickets hpping to be Big Brawler
---
2 years!???
---
The fun part of a game is to be.. challenging
---
I'm sorry, but you spoils the game by doing that
---
Now this is where flying phones are made

I'll share it with Reddit ! I'm uploading my making video. youtube.com/c/claycheese There's another brawlers in there, too.Thanks! 
---
Thiccochet is pretty well rounded rn
---
Crow on the other hand is definitely underwhelming rn 
---
Yeah. It would allow me to do some stupid ass plays that may or may not work
---
And I got gene yesterday from a big box
---
‚Äú1v1 in showdown‚Äù yeah buddy that‚Äôs definitely possible
---
That‚Äôs interesting, ok.. I‚Äôll have to consider buying Leon next time then. I never spend gems because I (to this day) don‚Äôt understand the most efficient way of spending them 
---
Posted 9 hours agoü§Ø

Yeah boi
---
This is really cool concept. It deserves alot more like than it has.
---

---
Thiccochet is actually decent right now...he's pretty versatile, just a high skill cap
---
Same
---
Its... its a joke.
---
Me neither
---
Also... I‚Äôve opened about 5 mega, 3 big and 10 brawl boxes and my damn legendary percentage hasn‚Äôt gone up one bit. What the hell
---
Is this a Jojo reference? 
---
Lmao beta player?

Hate mortis, but this skin is cool as hell.... i would be less apt to kill him than usual... :)

It's a lag issue in most games called "rubberbanding" an example is when you walk 10 steps forward but suddenly walk back 3 steps. 
---
Soo satisfying

Same here! Was going for Gene, but got Frank. Can't complain xP

How do you get brawlers name next to username

I love it.

I‚Äôm aware of what rubber banding is, I‚Äôve just never encountered it this severely in Brawl Stars

But I gotta push ;-;

No let‚Äôs be honest. That post saying ‚Äòomg I have 99 keys!‚Äô Deserves 500 upvotes. A lot of effort went into that

Oh, so just say, ‚ÄúHey, sorry. I‚Äôm not playing with you because you‚Äôre too bad. Sorry I don‚Äôt want to lose trophies‚Äù? Yeah that wouldnt make me seem like an asshole or anything, thanks for the great advice

My suggestion would be to just keep ranking up all of your brawlers until you unlock some more. Every new brawler is like a free couple hundred trophies.
---
Haha, that is funny. I get it! It is funny because you said ‚Äúlittle‚Äù and you had 1 percent! Hahahahaha

It would be equal to "tank speed", so just slower than Colt with star power, but I dont think it would be OP because they dont last long and they have to catch up to brawlers.  Tell me if you disagree.  I'm fine with that.

Bruh mortis uses more auto aim than dynamike

There‚Äôs probably some YouTube videos on it. You have to put a certain code around your name when you‚Äôre naming yourself or change name
---
here we go
---
They were not.
---
This comment was not approved by mortis gang
---
Why does your Reddit look like that?
---
I think you're wrong, my friend, Mortis needs precise races, only people who dont know how to play always use the auto-aim.
---
respecc
---
I‚Äôm using the reddit client Apollo 
---
I just added you. I am Axel1702 at 6.8k range and a little overleveled. Most of my brawlers are at 350 range, and I play constantly hahaha, see you
---
But I would have them at that time that bad luck
---
Good idea!
---
Sorry, I do not know how to speak in English yet.
---
As long as he has a hat I‚Äôm in.
---
I pretty much kill any mortis that spins me #stopthespin 
---
I made it 270, muhahahaha.
---
Ah I see thanks man! Just viewing reddit at work. I think those are css tags. Anyway, great win! ;)
---
i was 269 but didnt get the full screenshot in and when i clicked on the post it hit 274 lmao
---
There are posts wayyy more redundant that you should be removing instead of these.
---
I got nothing out of the 4k mega box (no brawlers)
---
someone count how many rollsü§£
---
[removed]
---
Same here, and i was el primo
---
Haha flair checks out. Git gud Mortis
---
That just happened 2 me xD
---
Phoenix crow: am I just a joke to you
---
Legit one of the most op characters in the game. A 1 star Shelly just"out played" my 8 star bull. I just uninstalled the game and I don't think I'm coming back
---
You should be able to buy brawlers with gold.
---
Sans?
---
Lmao, says the kid with the el primo flair, primo takes no skill.. ;)
---
Haha
---
Looks like I‚Äôm retarted too
---
#SWEETSOUNDS
---
Lol dodging a colt, rico and brock at the same time takes skill kiddo
---
I would be completely fine with as long as she were a legendary or mythic. Ha! Nope you get her at the start, complete bullshit, and shes apparently balanced.
---
Autoaim is the problem here, not shelly.
---
Anyone or a link to the video 
---
Molt is the GOAT
---
:)
---
I just went into feast or famine, played primo rushed mid auto aim only and had a 9 powercube game win, whatever you say buddy. Oh and there were atleast 3 colts. But whatever you say.
---
Same thing happened to me man. However I got Piper at 4.1k trophies, so just wait a little longer.
---
Because your mentally retarded and don‚Äôt get it
---
This right here. Shelly is a close range brawler. Almost every brawler in the game auto-aims when they are at close range to somebody. Only exceptions are probably throwers 
---
Anyone can play as shelly, anyone can play as bull, anyone can play as dynamike, anyone can play as frank, and so on. That's why you find so many, if you are so sick of shelly, why don't play as something that can counter her? Throwers work well, as well as pretty much every long ranged brawler. It's just point n shoot mate :)
---
Am I the one who doesn‚Äôt get it???
---
Lol mind telling me your primo's trophies?
---
Oh and by the way pal, im a pretty good mortis in fact, I have him at 230 trophies.
---
Legend says this what the Brawlers see when they see Jessie as big brawler...I think. 
---
Awesome art btw!
---
Sure lemme screenshot
---
Well there‚Äôs no other reason to say ‚Äúwhat‚Äù
---
What did he say?
---
looks great, but based on your other works the face expression is kind of repetitive
---
Otherwise,
---
**:^)**
---
Frank seems like a perfect fit for you, neiter of you can speak English!
---
I‚Äôm at 4.5 k and don‚Äôt have any of those brawlers. Wish I can get an epic, mythic or legendary. But I will probably be one of those people who get a legendary chance to 50% and still not get that legendary for years.
---
Her super is confusing.
---
Not letting me send the screenshot but 250 bc he was all I played back b4 global, and im f2p so i didnt get much bralwers.
---
#rRRrrrRrrRrgGgGgGGgHhh
---
Lol 230 is low cups you noob
---
That would be cool.
---
Was your mom in the room?
---
Can‚Äôt believe you got sands
---
The river up to is combinded so WRONG
---
I‚Äôve only been boss once it‚Äôs definitely broken
---
Congrats! Great brawler if you know how to use it
---
Autoaim kinda screws the balance of the game completely. It screws brawlers like mike over because he can‚Äôt through at his feet. Screw mortis over because of accidental taps.
---
All tanks use it because it makes their life so much easier. 
---
No Autoaim = balanced and more fun game.
---
#heuwbsjbsjshxbsbnsusbba
---
Yeah, it would be awesome if you could have a mic in brawls stars.
---
Your not wrong
---
Even though you get about 6 trophies each showdown win its bad lmao, your genuinely stupid.
---
Feast or Famine is an exception because-
---
- You have that big bush so ranged brawlers cant see you.
---
-At 250 trophies, there is negligible to no teaming at all so all the outside brawlers just fight themselves and give you an ez win.
---
My primo is at 550. Play on any non bush map and mass teams target you. Camping does not work because said teams scout every bush. Even on feast or famine, if you manage to be the survivor in the bush, a 5 man team of colt, brock, spike, poco and crow will easily kite you to death. Dodging and Winning against those teams requires hella skill. 
---
I think that it‚Äôs just because crow is so skinny
---
Oh and btw it would take about 39 games to get 230, keep in mind this is 1st place showdown, and you dont always win every time. Again, primo = no skill. But whatever.
---
Who tf is calling Mortis weak
---
i will do it everytime :D
---
It is low tier. Mid tier is considered 300-420. After that its high tier
---
It wouldn‚Äôt work for a heavy brawler like bull
---
Exactly, it would also take more skill.
---
Hey I‚Äôve seen players win here with mortis xD
---
I'm glad to get one even if it's just Piper
---
Is the star power going to heal him to full health when he uses his super?? That's way to strong imo.
---
Also how fast will he be in ball form and how many hits will it take to charge 
---
Tanks like Bull and Primo have been some of the worst brawlers in the high trophy range for some months now. They have a tiny range so when they finally get into range of somebody, they deserve the kill, auto-aim or not 
---
No, use those gems to buy tickets they will help u get more brwal boxes or token doubler!
---
Oh no! 
---
I was repeatedly double teamed by 2 colts when i left the center.
---
Lol Chrome bo.
---
This is like the El Primo versions  where you rotate him to make his hand point at the next trophy road reward.
---
OH SHIT!!
---
Cancer in 1 picture (BS related)
---
It is better to use your gems in token doublers since its still equivalent to 10 brawl boxes, but it costs 50 gems instead of 80.
---
You can also wait for a megabox offer for either 60 or 49 gems (in which case you would be only saving 1 gem comparing it to token doublers so its not the big deal)
---
Lol chrome bo
---
Spoken like a low trophy noob. Getting 230 cups on a brawler is legit super easy. 
---
Well, it‚Äôs kind of chrome.
---
I just want auto aim removed. I feel like it lowers the skill gap by a lot.
---
Yeah I know but it‚Äôs fun to team as long as you do have more than three friends 
---
Atm I have an offer of a 60 gem mega box I think
---
It's not a default skin
---
Pls save me üò≠
---
Epic looks like cgi real
---
At 7000 with no mythics or legenaries beside the Leon I spent 40 bucks on. F2P besides that one Leon offer
---
Really? Uhmm thanks for the info
---
pOCo goES lOCoOooOOOoo
---
I think auto aim is okay since it basically only in needed when someone is a shotgunner or get involved to a melee battle, long range brawlers don't count on that because you scarcely hit a foe when you using it.
---
(just shellys)
---
Not when your teamed on...
---
It was a joke at the time
---
If you're trying to become the big brawler, you have 1/6 chance. Takes about 6 tickets to become one
---
Kk bro.
---
Aww yes yes ive been caught!
---
i hope that can really pull and heal teammate before gene release lol
---
Also my total trophies are 2870 exactly, anyways i can debate after i eat if you continue replying.
---
I don‚Äôt think that a brawler that can swim in the water would fit into the game.
---
As an Irish ginger I love this
---
My point still stands that Primo requires skill in dodging mass teams at high cups. Only 2 teamers is a blessing at that range 
---
I have just betrayed the light side
---
"You have become the thing that you swore to destroy!"
---
Not worth it
---
At 230, you haven't even begun seeing mass teaming.
---
He‚Äôs not very fat compared to Pam.
---
Your point? 2870 is pretty low.
---
There is tho
---
Thank you man, I really thought that was a big deal. Was a good idea to ask first 
---
Do you mean Thicochet
---
BUT I ONLY DO 100
---
I mean, it really isn't considering the most trophies you can get in a win is 7.
---
Fuck Pam seriously
---
Bull with long range

I‚Äôm at 3.2 and I got everything except legendary

Oh my god we were so na√≠ve all along.

yes

a little

You shouldn't hide with a Shelly without super imo
---
Holy ass that's amazing!
---
Nope. Only a little

Lol I played it after global... however i think they remove it of the rotation after the last update

If you play over time, it adds up. Been playing for 9 months and have 9600

don‚Äôt expect too much, I‚Äôm only capable of very small things. I‚Äôll try though! (When I have the time)
---
Gems
---
Or the brawl box after reaching 9.3k trophies. 
---
It doesn‚Äôt matter for crow, but it matters for his teammate. It‚Äôs the difference between your Shelly beating theirs or your poco surviving a Darryl roll
---
FNmBI openup
---
woah there buddy
---
Hitbox is the area of an attack that hits an opponent. Hurtbox is the area that can be hit by an opponent. 
---
It‚Äôs not that hard to understand 
---
I think somebody touched his rocket
---
I don‚Äôt know how familiar you are with Beauty and the Beast, but this new Mortis reminds me of Monsieur Darque! Old Mortis looked a bit creepier (compliment), but I unfortunately didn‚Äôt play back then.
---
Use your brain and logic: Remove gene without a head's up warning --&gt;People spend their boxes hoping to find gene, but to no avail --&gt; Some people will still buy boxes and donate money, because they desperately want gene. Or they will buy the offer for 269 gems. Simple as that.
---
That would be awesome! I could totally see a rainbow mowing down an enemy‚Äôs health 
---
I think that SC must give his star power to 6 tiles, I am surely bad with him, but I have trouble killing my enemies. Bo is my favorite character, however I unlocked it yesterday, and I did not receive any cards from him by opening a box, is that normal? 
---
But why are you named lil skies? 
---
______ strait into her and deliver a piercing blow
---
Yep.
---
Spikes my guy
---
‚ÄúWould smash Pam‚Äù......
---
5 km away
---
GET YOUR ASS OVER THERE RIGHT NOW
---
pocos is not great (i have the poco world record i know what im talking about with poco)
---
bos star power is useless besides like 2 maps and after the nerf its not even great on them
---
genes isnt too new to judge, its just bad lol
---
franks helps a bit but its def still worse then crows
---
pipers is not fantastic 
---
either way you dont need to agree with me about these other star powers, crows is still a really good one lol
---
Personally I use them. I am maxed PowerPoints wise and there is a very large paywall for upgrading brawlers past level 7
---
Basic attacks that pierce walls and a press-to-win super with global range, and you don't even need to aim it either?
---
The concept seems interesting, but overturned af
---
Those thousands looks like a flag of Italy üáÆüáπ 
---
yah
---
Great ship, but I feel sailboats work better
---
And what do you know I wasted the 2.3K one on Jessie by mistake (it was before you had to confirm it)
---
Would have been nice I see the tokens earned... 
---
When you notice a bulge in Piper's dress
---
I think his cape should be changed to a different color
---
El Primo is pointing to the mega boxes. If you dont it 
---
üòÇ
---
I was thinking white to match the Irish flag, but I had a hard time shading it with different shades of gray. Would definitely look cooler in white though! 
---
Can also dodge between colt shots 
---
Love it
---
My team did :D 
---
may be yes may be notüòÑ
---
fbi pls
---
*es aqui
---
It‚Äôs a cool idea though.
---
Yes I hearted
---
I was thinking a dark green color or even a rainbow cape, (2 hidden meanings ;) )
---
Oh hell yeah
---
That can be a new skin!
---
Lunar the same w 1500 coins and its $3 dollars more ($9.99)
---
Go commit not alive
---
They still gave gems to the people who opened boxes, ur points prove that supercell accidentally made people spend money or use resources, but then you say it was a cash grab which means you think they did it on purpose.
---
Holy NOW THATS ALOT OF DAMAGE
---
Truth hurts. No legendary and no mythic. Stuck at 6k
---
Same to me bro I think thats because you are around that trophy range where everyone just plays tanks, shellys so yeah....F
---
No... Quickfire isn't meant to be perfect. Manually aim instead.
---
Do people play only shelly at 550?
---
Gene feels very strong at the moment, i think he'll be a good fit for gem grab and bounty teams, maybe brawl ball as well as a goalie puller / killer.  
---
I'm excited to see where he goes, and if he'll get any tweaks.  
---
Right now he feels strong, but i don't think he's "too" strong, his match ups can be close calls most of the time.  
---
His ability to pull and execute is pretty sick though, annoying derp on the other team? show him who's boss.
---
The only thing I saw was crow jumping as if the crow had springs
---
r/darrylgang or
---
U
---
Hell go right in with his sharp long ______ And pierce right through her...
---
It will be very ‚ÄúCreature of the dark‚Äù
---
You‚Äôre gonna have a bad time... 
---
The blades aren‚Äôt even sharp, he just throws them so frickin hard
---
Yup, they made it on purpose so people would spend their money and boxes. But, because I'm not a supercell employee, i cannot fully prove my point. However, you have to think about this whole situation: they made **SPECIAL** alerts on reddit and twitter, but not on the game itself . Why? 
---
I agree about some things.
---
&gt;These fuckers rival dynamike with teaming. I mean seriously, they just team with ANYONE. Frank, nita, tara, etc. 
---
Is it just me, or do Crows always attack me if I wan't to team/am just walking, but they gladly team with anyone else. Thats the main reason I hate Crow. 
---
I believe the enemies only turn golden when you have Crow's star power
---
Your pants 
---
Yeah I know, quick fire as it is right now is fine, I just wanted it to aim towards brawlers instead of boxes 
---
She‚Äôs 
---
Thanks!
---
May calihente
---
I wish that it is clusterbombdude
---
haha ive got so many things to complain about, starting with the game going back to what is was in october and changing brock back, he looks like a monkey now
---
I had all 3 of the epics at 1400...
---
Lmfao that's me üôÉ
---
Oh I read it wrong, How many trophies do you have? 
---
I opened 40 normal boxes, 4 big ones, 2 Megan and got nothing. Then I blew what‚Äôs left on buying him :/
---
nice
---
someone must have gotten Tara below 500 trophies

r/dynamikegang
---
Only players like you don't know how to deal with crow
---
Why do you like barley so much ? 
---
You weebs disgust me
---
Wo such an old gag!
---
how many trophies are u at? and also crow has horrible health and dps so the fact that he has the unique ability to poison is needed. plus not just crow teams with everyone he sees, other brawlers do and also the fact that crow is one of the least viable brawlers out there doesnt help your case...
---
and like other people said, theres literally 5 other team based gamemodes other than showdown..... so why th are you complaining when sd isnt even a good mode to push in?
---
Just WOW!! üòçüòç
---
Yeah, it needs to be tweaked. Like I said. Maybe in showdown it's just brawlers in vision with a max of 3?
---
The concept is cool though. There's two many "lol powerful basic shot" supers
---
So...he is wearing an one-piece skirt?
---
Lol I think you dont understand a single thing. Gtfo noob
---
oooooooh i could just KILL someone whyyyyyyyyy \*cries in corner
---
i got my first epic at 3k trophies and my first mythic at 7k, that legendary might be at 12k...
---
Isn't it obvious. Protagonist always wins.
---
Omg that‚Äôs what i was missing! Before uploading this I just felt uneasy for some reason, and i found my answer as to why lol
---
Good job. Looks amazing!
---
I didn't get that...
---
Uh terrible dps doesnt matter in solo sd when their teammates are right there.
---
And no shit other people team. You just see crows teaming a ton
---
Rule 7. If you want to recruit for your club or are looking to join a club, post in r/BrawlRecruit.

For game rooms and socializing,

[use our Discord server  instead](https://discord.gg/brawlstars).  
---
Yeah, but they hit very few brawlers in specific circumstances. With Shelly you have to be very near to the opponent and you can hit more than one only if you try to hit someone farther, it's very hard hitting 2 people at blank point. With this super you deal 1000 damage to everybody (which is more or less the same amount of dmg that Bull and El Primo's super does) while revealing their positions. Also, i guess that this super autorecharges since you can effectively hit &gt;3 people at once dealing 1000 to them.
---
Well I‚Äôve been playing since global release, just don‚Äôt grind the game too much. So I‚Äôve had a lot of time to open boxes. After I‚Äôm out of tokens available I stop. That would probably explain why I‚Äôm so low.
---
wait, thats illegal
---
Some context: he was asked what's under leons mask.
---
I bet you 1000 gems, Darryl will win this! 
---
They‚Äôre so clean
---
*dials fbi* 
---
"we got a live one here!" 
---
I'm so lost. What's he saving 1 gem on? 
---
I think this would be way to hard to establish because that would require to much dedicated time. Plus it is pretty much just showdown 
---
The mega box offer for 49
---
Wat. I'm at 6.2k and all my brawlers are at only power 6. 
---
It‚Äôs jz tht ur frds are lucky. I m at 9.4k no legendaries ..
---
How tf did bull get freaking 30 power cubes
---
Bad
---
I'm working on it
---
yea, that gave me nightmares. 
---
Looks almost same to the ingame ones. Great job.

Too rich? You mean too lucky

What about Pam? I have her 
---
Thaks,  I worked hard on it
---
supercell pls give me a brawler too, I'm at 5k and I haven't any brawler above super rare.
---
I know you read the post of this guy. 
---
Glad to hear that : ) 
---
I have other ideas if you want.
---
Wait what, useless? People run out of coins quite early on in this game - I could level up 8 brawlers atm but no coins.
---
What gamemode is MM
---
I had to down vote this post to get it to 69 upvotes
---
Very balanced rewards 
---
I agree! Getting brawlers should be something like in League of Legends. You can either buy them for earnable currency or for 'gems'. Great way to make legendarys earnable for everybody!
---
The matchmaking system is a bit wrong I see
---
I'm improving it
---
a little.. strong? 
---
Not the bill one that ones so ugly like all real life bull players
---
This is like an "ear".
---
oof
---
Mhm she‚Äôs a keeper
---
Lol I like that you had a shower shot but we would not swap them, crow would lose burst damage and have a faster charging super because Shelly can be too long to charge but I think crow would have probably bulls charge time for the super
---
Don't you just love it when Big Brawler Jessie throws in another mini-boss everytime you kill one?
---
*The more you know..*
---
Thanks
---
The Shelly gang approves
---
El primo with shield
---
me too, I was so pissed...
---
*YES*
---
5 tokens per kill is way too generous. a little goes a long way, all the skilled players can just farm showdown and get unlimited boxes thus accelerating progression by ALOT. 
---
id say either make it 1 token but its infinite or 5 tokens but with a recharge
---
This is so cute
---
NOOOOO oh wait I already did it and get the time score

In what way? She's average on most showdown maps except the shotgun maps, where she excels. She's decent on brawl ball, poor in bounty, average to good on gem grab and heist depending on map and team. Shes certainly not OP in almost any map/mode except cavern churn and feast or famine to a lesser extent, and that's exactly where she should be good.
---
Basically any range brawler will have a field day against shelley unless they screw up. 
---
Most people in the end game are maxed though.
---
okie, understood :3
---
r/nitagang
---
You are.

End of story

what a fucking joke, i mean supercell has created a great game but it's like they WANT people to not play it or put time into it. That's only from the player perspective, this is even worse.

There already two epics which if combined are this character

Plot twist, they spun for a while and bull let spike win cuz hes a good dude
---
What I don't like about pam is her dps(damage per second). She unloads so slow any shotgunner could easily kill her in a close combat.

This caught me off guard. It's so detailed.

Well thats perfect

It's not like it's in my control. What if they dodge every shot or if we are the last 2 alive behind a wall?
---
Yeah but I mean going up against a star power 10 dynamike is just frustrating. I mean how bad do you have to be to need the star power to win games.
---
That was quick, thank you
---
Even if you're Kendrick or Cole or Sean?
---
that's too much gems
---
No problem

It‚Äôs impossible to dodge every shot if the Pam player isn‚Äôt absolute garbage. Get better, then come back and see you‚Äôre wrong.

---
&gt;No she is part of the FBI look at here glasses
---
I would rather have a super mega box every 2000 trophies, or something else really rewarding. Any milestone under 1000 trophies is a joke.
---
Oh not that one i thought of an old one with other brawlers and who they are related to lol
---
It looks pretty awesome BTW
---
Yh it was abit too salty of him
---
Yeah but then when your saving the goal you have to spam pick up
---
What about skins though? Gems are better
---
This is actually a pretty good idea wouldn‚Äôt mind a week trial first tho 
---
Star power is great the way it is. If you want it you have to earn it .. but at the point I‚Äôm right now. I need around 13k gold to get all brawler lvl 9. And extra 26k gold to get their star power from the shop. So yeah I need gold and they are giving me 50 gold for pushing from 9k to 9.15k and 25pp which would be another 50 gold since I am maxed with power points for reaching 9.3k.

U ARE BELONG TO HELL (lol)
---
thank you from a creature of the night
---
Never thought of that but OK
---
once i really wanted to get some trophies and experience, there was noone online so i played with randoms, it costed me about 500 trophies, randoms are braindead
---
WHERE IS THE LOLLIPOP OMG
---
I'd honestly abuse it just because I don't like the way my teammates play, and I wouldn't be the only one to report for whatever reason.
---
Why did you hide the power level lol. 
---
Oh wow
---
A fair criticism, they could add a slight cooldown to the button as to prevent spam(so that its all about timing) supercell would have to playtest this.
---
Guys which no friends or no online friends: Am i joke to you
---
Not as far as I know, I just save up because I get disappointed when I open 1 box and don‚Äôt get a new brawler.
---
And if you saw this video (Spoiler alert) I was even more disappointed for opening all of them and not getting any brawler.
---
You aren‚Äôt the only loser in here...
---
I was playing and got 25 seconds
---
Oh fuck ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)

Mortis gang approves
---
I like all characters to be honest (except for Piper and Frank, not a big fan (but that might change if I tried them)).

Also congrats on getting spike!

Oh ok

Goodie, Good bot

Nah ur not

This is my favorite of all your creations it looks so good props to you man.
---
Fair enough ;)

They also go on larger groups I believe, so that would help against teamers

my shelly was 390ish, some of them were above 400 and if anyone in the match is above 400, you get the reply button. i don't record all the time, this is the first one

Have much fear, Mortis is here!

it's a rough estimation. it doesn't tell when you will get brawler.

Or do I just really suck 
---
Give me two darryls
---
New religion confirmed?
---
She shoots 9 scrap metals, 5 in the middle, 2 left and two right so aim and move like Colt
---
These power-point boxes are really good concepts and should be added to the trophy road! 
---
It depends if you have over 100 if you do thengo for it if not save those gems for other offers
---
The motivation we guys get is "300" coins for pushing from "10k to 11k"
---
Why does everyone like using these air-pod memes? 
---
Nono, add Pipis. r/PipisGang

Me too plox

The exploit still exists, there are just two robo rumble maps. Next robo rumble, the exploit will be available again.

I dont think it fits the game to well but i gusse it can if it threw pencils only it would work and the shot would do extra stuff like if it hit a wall it would make a painting and if a brawler looks at it it can distract the brawler mabye idk but just tryin* to help :)
---
nah, hitbox is the parts of a weapon that can come into contact with another hurtbox and damage them. they're different
---
Putting Gene in there was a nice touch.
---
Shadman No! 
---
Yeah that stinks, but this I made for fun and i may make my own series based off him in the game on my YT channel. But i cant find any good, FREE, animating softwares...

Wow i did not notice that 
---
Love the concept! The art is on point (pun initially not intended, until I noticed it), you did such a good job emulating the brawl stars style! Can't wait to see more from you!

They didn't fix it, this is another map.

Oh don‚Äôt get me wrong, Shelley will romp most with her super. But yeah it sucks play 3 star powers with none yknow
---
How will people with maxed brawler benefit from this 
---
Lmaooo
---
I actually did the same om my phone so now i see the normal game
---
Inside you will find coins, points for 5 different brawlers and if you have luck a new brawler 
---
The amount of quality on these drawings on this reddit keeps amazing me, really.

Auto-aim was a big *nerf* to Mortis if anything lol.

This was when I mained Darryl in excess. I miss those days.

Doc Brown? 
---
Agree. I have my Shelly to Max and i still find very hard to win at times just because I get out ranged by most of the brawlers. There has to be some sort of compensation for her range.
---
Really? I ordered mine a week ago and it came in only 3 days
---

Can you send me one without a watermark, I want this as my background

---
lol my nita takes 6 shots.. haha while typing this i  accidentally typed sh\*t instead of shots XD
---
you need the big G R I N D to get that bonus on the brawl box 
---
Its Better than the key dobbler
---
Eh he's kinda not though. At lower levels and on maps with very grassy centers maybe.
---
If everyone picks Bull, just pick a long range character. Always check bushes. Keep your distance. Easy top 4.
---
Multiple Sparpowers or Supers for each Brawler: They should reward us with new abilities(super) or star powers for each brawler... it would be cool to can change our brawler star power for an other one and can choose which one to use
---
I‚Äôd be happier if they made it 75 power points and at least 200 coins
---
Well played nonetheless, I hope to join you someday.....
---
Thank you for replying to my one month old comment :)

Check your brawler chance percentage
---
While this is technically better than a key doubler, tickets would be a better offer if you can consistently do well in Robo rumble. You could also save them for a skin or something, just to keep them on hand.

At least her fast reload speed makes up for her small range and less damage

Add them between in the sections where you push 250 for one shitty reward and one more 250 for a mega box

Might sound awfully weird, but grind SD with poco. Thats what I do to untilt and i‚Äôm at 11.6k

So many good ideas today

Amazing idea. Remember i‚Äôm an OG up-voter here on this post. 
---
Ricochet really let himself go.
---
Lol when El Primo rushes me as Shelly on my second account
---
Brawlers are never "created" by one person in the team - and anyone can come up with an idea. It usually starts (but doesn't have to) with the actual game design and abilities. 
---
After that's done, we have a discussion what the Brawler could be and Paul will typically start concepting until he hits the final concept. From there the concept gets handed over to Phil, who is currently owning the part of creating the 3D model you see in-game most of the time.
---
Besides these two, an animator, VFX artist, potentially UI artist and od course sound guy contribute to the final product. ;)
---
It really is a team effort.

Its because he is a CREATURE OF THE NIGHT

Bo at 3000 trophies is just not acceptable. Who else played before global release and got Bo out of a box?

Make it transparent tho

If you have cellular data, use it. It should work.
---
Stick a fork 
---
It‚Äôs a good concept but if this is implemented they might as well just give us a max brawler to begin with
---
I get you
---
I agree, I don‚Äôt think this alone decides your skill but I was just going off what you were saying about being unskilled if a shelly supers near boxes. I think a skilled shelly wouldn‚Äôt do that, but just cuz you don‚Äôt do it, doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre unskilled

Crow/Penny: Lets camp in here!

Crow: \*spins\* its ok

Basically, it was a Drake meme.
---
Saying that Supercell don't do weekly updates,with new skins and game modes. 
---
And prefer to make a update each 3 months.
---
There was something more, but it was so shit, that I already forgot.
---
And like, what? Weekly updates? It would be so buggy.. Not to mention that, it isn't a easy thing to do
---
Its fair they still have same trophies
---
Can you send a link for it and is it free? 
---
I mean each team is about 250 trophies so that‚Äôs pretty fair. 
---
People who say*
---
None taken! Most of my brawlers are level 7+ and I like others a lot more than Darrel. I guess it's because I have options.
---
Yea but the disconnect is so large :P
---
Lol frl
---
Pretty much the whole game took place in that one spot believe it or not, but to me it sounds like you can't do it that's why you're sitting here arguing.
