Now this is a meme, nice to see someone else with my name is making epic memes

He can atak
---
THANKS!

Yeah the star power for sure was the cause of the miracle win, never doubted that.  Key is to not rely on it so that it might save you at the end like this.  I was the only one on my team with range, and had 2 teams hitting us from both direction while staying under cover.  
---

---
On the flip side no matter what I can usually take out the player that killed me when they move in for the tokens.

Have you tried top hat mortis though?
---
But what if that top hat Mortis is disturbing literally everyone and stealing everyone’s boxes?
---
Congrats!
---
Ok now this is epic
---
If he had to change his name to that and make a club with that name, he probably mainly plays with randoms, and it's quite hard to push in 3v3 modes like that.
---
Can't jump to conclusions yet, it could be he got hacked or maybe his sibling got on his device. Maybe try contacting him to see what happened. And when you said "close friend" is that internet friend or real life friend?
---
Tick is actually the hardest to kill in high tier skillful matchups when he has well-oiled
---
Not Funny, didn’t laugh
---
You should retexture golden apple with power cube.It's fking awesome dude and i love your work. Keep going

Call supercell. Other than that good luck 😂

Thank you very much!

---
What do you mean piper and tick are bad too
---
Well if you're a noob, then yes. But if you are at every brawler 500, then just have some fun if you like!
---
At least with piper and tick you don't have to kill your self to damage the boss.
---
Also, piper isn't that bad on boss battle.

I can send you the models if you want

AWESOME! Is there one for or or are you in the process? Also you should add armour sets to look like the brawlers.

at least we know for sure it's a rare

Tick strong what you talking about

Gotta love the fixed piper
---
I get this wasn’t the case cause he hit the wall but  in regards to your question, if someone like a Shelly uses her super and he’s moving it stops bulls super
---
What glitch
---
It hasn’t come out yet
---
Next brawlers super is going to be some sort of decoy cast.
---
He shoots the skull tokens instead of lasers
---
shut up man, that meme isn’t funny like at all
---
Well frick. Do you know when it will?
---
The people that won giveaways got it today so probably Friday
---
I am the one On left bottom!!🤣😂😂
---
now, only brawlers above 550 trophies lose trophies, not 500
---
What’s the difference
---
r/unexpectedborderlands
---
Yeah, you said it! Lol Definitely gonna help with getting boxes easier
---
SooOo...Relatable!! 🙃
---
Fascinating...I will take your comment into consideration, Thank You!
---
Matchmaking is just fine. There is a one to one matchmaking thing, where everyone will have someone on the other team with a similar number of trophies (might not be the case if some people are in a team)
---
I have, but 60% of the time, the thrower is just spamming auto-aim or they’re trash at aiming.
---
This is main reason why I want it so you can unlock replays at 2500 trophies
---
Nice
---
So you mean to replace Shelly with 8-bit. 8-bit second star power would be bandaid but better
---
 These are actually good tips for dumbasses right here
---
me too! I won it from discord
---
Needs a lot less grass
---
In this match not was the case and i was playing ladder alone. It has too much problem, is no this match, i had played many match like this.
---
Everyone who gets a legendary so early on can actually suck my butt. 10k with legendary chances of 0.1700 and NO LEGENDARY.

I am more bigger then you

Ahhh yes, selly

Were can I download this?

Season Reset, any Brawlers have above 550 trophies will be reset to a certain number of trophies depends how much they have, and the lost trophies will be converted into Star Points, there is a chart showing how much Star Points they will get and what number of trophies your Brawler will be set back to after the season, just tap the Trophies in your Brawler's stats for the chart
---
Just make it the dead ringer

Oh shit, thank you. Definitely not gonna buy it then
---
Wtf how?
---
Yeah, every two weeks all your brawlers with more than 500 trophies lose some trophies. You are given start points as compensation. This is why you lost trophies

It’s a drawing of chiyo sakura

The idea behind the map was to have a brawl ball map with 2 goals. They open 1 tile wider in overtime or if you have a wall breaker. I miss the old pinhole punt map, with the 1 tile wide goal, and now the name is pointless as it’s just as wide as the rest. Hoping this gives some ideas for variation in maps.
---
You act like 3v3 is some rare mode. Most people play 3v3, i play 3v3 w randoms always and im 17k. Yes randoms arent great but if ur good you can still push
---
Maybe a little bit...
---
Thanks for the Response! I was more looking for how to get onto hot but thanks for the response :)
---
Well according to ur profile ur username is Manny so...
---
Internet cuz I have been playing with him since global release

U will get rest by converted to coins

Would the decoy move?

So,what exactly do u mean?Neeko’s W or Leblanc’s passive

Now over 549 trophies

Ur Romanian and u have school starting on 9th

Cool!

Thanks!
---
Make chests the heist
---
More like a Speed Mirage or a Time Remnant
---
That’s still bullshit. You should not be paired up with someone 10K trophies below you just cuz they mainly push one Brawler only. In a team, sure, but not with complete randoms
---
A Shelly at 600 Brawler trophies with 1.2K total trophies plays drastically different than someone with 12K total trophies. It’s utter garbage
---
Oh boo hoo let me press f in the world's smallest keyboard
---
^f

I show a brawl ball vid not because I scored but is because I'm the one scoring 90% of the time to help noobs like u

The original video is of a baby bunny getting shot in a video game.

My life is so sad
---
In my main account of brawl stars i have 10k without legendaries BUT IN MY SECONDARY ACCOUNT I HAVE 3K WITH SPIKEEEEEEE!

WHY SUPERCELL HATE MY MAIN!

how can you get all the way to 10k and not know about the season reset

Some of these are actually smart

What do you mean? You got less rewards than before the update?

r/shittybrawlstars didn't even credit the original
---
Level 1 gameplay
---
Bird super?
---
even if it did, with 20 tickets and token doublers you can win up to 12000 points. Thats why I said except events. people downvoting just stupid comments, this discussion is just useless you have no point to prove
---
You are sooooo lucky some people dont have legendary at 13k
---
RoboRumble is the only ticketed event where I spend all my tickets. Currently have 100+ by waiting for that.
---
You probably overestimating yourself
---
HOW DO YOU GET SANTAMIKE
---
Wow nice
---
We’re interpreting his/her words differently. I read it as u/Simqn_  could use the weekend event to get even more tokens by using the ticketed to maximize it, because of the whole context of the photo. What you’re saying is that u/Simqn_ is saying *overall* ticketed events still give you more tokens, even without the weekend event. This is clearly the most ambiguous shit ever and you’re trying to draw conclusions. Tf you saying he’s right I’m wrong. Lets ask then, u/Sinqn_ were you aware that ticketed events *do not* apply to the weekend token doubler?
---
He isnt really for killing he is like crow so dont be too agresive
---
Bene e pure italiano se avessi un computer....
---
11k trophies and no legendary but I don't have boxes either 😂😭😂😭

Is it just me or did anyone think this was a minion skin at first glance?

2. There is some lunar event going on rn i dont really understand it

Dont underestimate penny

at least you guys get to play

Removed - Your post is too short, please expand on your title.
---
Please fix the bugs in Crow. There're so many of them.
---
1. When Crow with "Carrion Crow" star power hits a box with less than 50% of hp in Showdown mode, the hp column does turn pink but damage won't increase. (The "Carrion Crow" star power works on every target - the brawlers, the turrets of brawlers, the safe in heist, the IDK in seige, the bots... - everything you can hit with the daggers, except for the boxes in Showdown mode) 
---
2. When Phoenix Crow with "Extra Toxic" star power hits a target, there's only animation of catching fire without the down arrow which indicates the target is sapped.
---
3. Sometimes after Phoenix Crow uses his super, he walks improperly like his limbs are frozen.
---
I like this brawler very much, but these bugs esp the first one make me put him aside. Please fix these bugs ASAP! Thanks a lot!
---
You forgot a couple zeros
---
I play penny a lot and never came to this
---
Thanks for your answer
---
This skin idea 10/10

I want these messages added into the game plus some extra that I cannot think of now but can be pretty useful

Yes

Wtf does that even mean????

Top Leon in my country became top Leon ip my arse. rip 900 trophies

nice map there
---
I love the key board
---
you forgot "dont fucking play tick"
---
yep, i just had a random tick in my big game
---
Primo with 13 is weak
---
Do not even thing about spinning in showdown it is bad and makes you a asshole
---
Apparently not old enough to know what that is, although now i know its a game n stuff it’d probably a horror game or something

Cuz his hp is actually the name of a game its called 6120 look it up

What?

i got all the mythics and spike before any of the epics

True, but right now, it’s the worst skin

I wanted to run to my super to kill them but just hit the tip of the train and got knocked back into the other part of the train

No its rainbow

Woahhh this one is so much better lol, u should try drawing in photoshop or any other application on pc
---
We just found a cure to the cancer

Ikr at the very least speed up button
---
But the people white the leg
---
Lol hey I only know of Rico's super not dealing double damage to the same target a month ago... seems like it would make sense that it would do double damage but nope.
---
Every game does this. Supercell is already pretty okay compared to those other money milking companies
---
Yall complaining about Shelly, 8-Bit and Crow but what really needs a buff is our random duos😷
---
Try -60 trophies in 8 games
---
r/JustLearnedTheFWord
---
Totally cool I totally understand why you would want to push showdown, maybe since you have the edge, try to take control of the game more in 3v3s if your brawler is able to? Maybe this might give you more ideas to develop your own strategy to handle this madness lol. Personally I try to hold my lane and actively help out my adjacent lane as a general rule. If my opponent is good then I’ll just focus solely on my lane. But yeah sometimes there’s really nothing you can do hahaha... I’ve been in situations where I’m basically taking on 2 brawlers the entire game just to draw them away from the centre but my teammates can’t even get a single gem.
---
10000000000000000000000000000000000000IQ

She’ll shock is not an S tier SP

not brawl stars related.

Play first of all, nice save by that Darryl, secondly sorry for not believing you previously. Hopefully people like this will get banned if supercell adds a report button the next update.
---
Average
---
you are next level of retarded. he doesn't say its his own, AND YOU LEAVE HIS FULL NAME.
---
Sorry
---
What's wrong in spending coins in power points?What if there's a offer who gives you Power pints for your favourite brawler?
---
Ye its ok i like proving stuff also thx about darryl
---
So many people I know are like that. I have 150 showdown wins, barely more than him, just enough for star tokens, I also push 3v3 a lot. Id say more ppl push 3v3 than only showdown
---
Just a question I don’t know because I see people getting exited having “1 followers”
---
Agree did u check my gameplay its called here you go u/Reaper21lol
---
Yeah but maybe they actually changed the way they work...
---
Snappy sniping user
---
I believe Rosa is not bad. I use Rosa as my primary brawler for Boss fight (I'm struck at insane 2 due to bad randoms with Frank and other funny brawlers). She's good, better than bull I guess.
---
you are still retarded by wanting to report someone who is sharing the art.
---
The smiley is in caps lock, didn't you know?
---
Do you mean power points? Star points cannot be bought they come from season end rewards
---
Jesus Christmas there is no pleasing you assholes.
---
Hmmm. The health bar is green, isn't it ?
---
Thats fine
---
Sorry i didnt noe the stone emoji wasnt allowed
---
Wtf??
---
I don‘t get it.. You do those good pulls and then standing there afk?
---
It’s not right to just stick with your opinion and ignore everyone.
---
That’s the weird thing, I know what I heard, but it’s so unrealistic.
---
Tsktsktsk Primo anticipated and assumed the ball wouldn't be thrown into the goal lololololollolololoolloolollollollol.
---
Colt is now Pam
---
There were some gems on offer ages ago probably with a level pack. I got 300. I saved the other 50 and bought Leon when he was in offer for 350 gems.
---
Well he never credited the original artist dumbo
---
The mortis 2 star power icon here look like "you just got spike!"
---
On the counter side tho, you would need to be extremely lucky to get those "max" loots (max gems, for example). Probably way luckier than to unlock a legendary... because the chance of getting 12 gems is already very rare, imagine that 10 times... thats of course if the boxes still work as they once did. Lets do some maths: lets say you have 1/100 chances to get 12 gems in a box (FYI its less then than...) if you wanted to have 12 gems twice, it would be 1/200, then leading to 1/300 etc, etc... up to 1/1000. And thats not counting the actual chances and the other various drops possible.

Man i bought a megabox with my 60 gems i should wait for the powerpoints offer

Hello , some of these pics are from my video dont u dare give any credit ?
---
I think you keep getting downvoted because of the emoji use in your replays lol
---
You have so much luck. I got 24/28 at 8k :/
---
It actually was at 700 gameplay it’s easier for the auto aim spammers to climb nowadays
---
Actually, crow isn't faster than all other brawlers
---
The randoms I had were never good. Mortis isn't the counter for tanky stuff usually.
---
It was too complicated for new players and not casual friendly
---
I was thinking the same before losing 414 trophies because of this...
---
Don't mind him. He's probably just a kid who wants attention
---
This would be great for you yet annoying for the enemies.
---
Great idea
---
Nice.
---
The music is roudabout and the to be continued is a meme that came from a anime called jojo bizarre adventure
---
Yeah but where the fuck is robo rumble, 5 weeks have passed without it and the next mode is a that no one cares - big boss
---
I'm a the only one who finds the refresh rate of this clip satisfying?
---
 The idea with tickets came to me cool came up
---
Congrats.
---
I’m 13K and I don’t have this
---
I'm 13.1K and have literally 0 boxes in que
---
Well,yeah but as a piper and as a brock is preety hard to climb in trophies using auto-aim,i mean they are probably bush campers..
---
It's because supercell want to make the game more simple and easy to play if it gets too complicated new players won't want to play
---
This Carl skin is worth 30 gems at most, miss me with that 11 gem discount
---
So it's a nerf?
---
Why?
---
ZA WARLDO!
---
Ty man, I apreciate it
---
Some overlevelled cards or you just didnt push them. Ur acc is good but not pro
---
Broken
---
head looks like a minion
---
Like
---
I'm always at my highest trophies (current season) when the season ends.(every brawler)
---
Accurate
---
Especially an 8 bit that's staying in his turret's AOE.
---
My friends are like yo why did you die you suck even though I died for them
---
3 weeks min.
---
I LIKE IT
---
Shouldn't*
---
I’m at 5000 trophies but my only decent characters are Dynamike, Barley, Tick, Poco, and brock.
---
Me too! But I noticed several others that commented about the bug on the bus YouTube channel
---
What SP you use?
---
What should I be playing?
---
11/10, you are a god, man I love destroying teamers.
---
Well I think The nerf was needed but they needed it to hard like 85% or 90% would’ve been enough.But Yeah he totally relied on that Starpower and He was a bad Brawler.Its the same what happened to Poco
---
Dude this is so underrated
---
В мене тож таке було
---
because new players will never be able to catch up and beta players will have most trophies without reset.
---
WE WANT ANIMATION!
---
its quite an achievement im proud of
---
the robots have finally decided to assert dominance
---
It will be very cooool. If it will be of course.
---
I hope they fix it as soon as possible because it is unnerving ahahah
---
Za warudo is what you wanted to say right
---
The point was that Darryl could deal that damage with this rework.
---
What the hell.
---
Also Mortis, who I'd say is technically faster because of his attack
---
So there wont be a October one there will
---
Took us 5 people to understand that.
---
Translate:I get Crow!
---
I got Tara when I was opening a box at like 2k and I was going like LeGEndArY and I opened the box and I got tara
---
Let's face it, star points aren't worth it as it is right now. The "Gold" skins aren't even amazing, they're just skins that exist but they're yellow all over. High players aren't going to be pushing every single brawler high so it would be better to minimise trophy loss on some brawlers. Also people don't just drop in solos. There's often Bball games where a person will pop up and score og's on purpose.
---
if you want star points then focus on few brawlers( not 1 maybe 5 to 10) 550 should be easy to get if you have lvl 6 or 7 brawlers. that will fetch you 50 star points per brawler.  pushing all brawlers is good for trophy road but rewards above 9k are trash so not really recommended.
---
Huh
---
not funnny anymore
---
No, they just improved the trophy system a LOT. You can win 10 trophies in ONE game... how crazy is that?
---
YOU THOUGHT IT WAS DIO BUT IT WAS I KARS!
---
Well now he’s no longer a random
---
And I bet that if he would've let him live he would've teamed too, 99.99% sure that other Mecha Bo would accept him to this team
---
Do we want another Snare a Bear?
---
(Also why the fuck didnt they nerf Snare a Bear the longer I think about it the angrier I get)
---
Wait,didn't you just post a drawing?Anyways,good drawing
---
***with auto-aim***
---
I thought this was just the wifi monster thanks for enlightening us. Lets bring this to the front u have my upvote!
---
NO ONE CARES
---
r/woooosh
---
How is Carls second SP useless? Its saved my life more times than I can count, and is insanely good in modes such as Gem Grab and Brawl Ball, not to mention helps him counter brawlers he usually couldnt up close like leon, and el primo
---
Broken. Beyond. Broken
---
This is threat. I gonn murd my dong
---
I can help you.
---
I can relate
---
Hahaha Yes! Just created this account now haha I have an instagram page that i use to post this draws and etc. Now i will be posting here too hahah Thank you!!!
---
Why the FUCK does this only have 70 upvotes
---
you can shove the fuck right off with that, your comment was distinctly intended to offend.
---
what’s the bug?
---
cambia la lingua del gioco prima di fare un post ;) \[a me una volta hanno cancellato un post perché non era inglese (era un semplice replay)\].
---
   
---
Crow looks beautiful from clay, but when I try to do something, I can’t do anything, so I see that others make it better than me :(
---
Thanks &lt;3
---
How do you do that big Letters?
---
I really hope this is real
---
Ma io posto da 2 mesi quasi e non mi hanno cancellato niente anche se faceva proprio pena
---
Dam Leon looks fun
---
Yep
---
Band Aid is still better in SD bc it increases your survivability.
---
OR CLIMBING UP THE IFFEL TOWER
---
Aren’t you supposed to hit people for your super to charge?
---
not in darryls case. It even says that in the info for his super
---
I praised the shop for poco star points. The chest gave me enough for rank 9 and i bought amega chest with my star points and got screeching solo instantly
---
how is this not in hot this will be important for clubs if it's real
---
Same but I got mortis.
---
Shark Leon will come in this upcoming friday
---
Anyone else? Could use support in getting this to ‘top post’ ... Supercell May then address the issue
---
No. Im talking about 15k, 16k and above. Im at 13k and thats still not the "pro" trophy range...
---
there is a gameboy 8bit
---
its called 8bit classic
---
Darryl super recharge automatically of course you dont know probably you are a new player
---
Писать научитесь, девочка (или что ты за существо ಠ_ʖಠ )
---
Really if so Thanks !
---
Um, ok......
---
But I got all my star powers without paying
---
Crow maybe?
---
Bro I only used 1
---
Using cactus? It's just using your teammate
---
but what reward will the boss get?
---
Ups....
---
Autoaim should be allowed below 200 trophies but not above because I could get my shelly to 700 trophies and not manually aim a single time
---
The problem is that they suck and play like bots. They are ruining the experience. Luckily this is just robo rumble but it also happens in the other modes and it causes us to lose and get frustrated. Why does some noob that stared playing the game 3 weeks ago get paired up with an experienced player. It's unfair and annoying.
---
I pusher my 8-bit fron 470 to 550 in 1h 45min (from 4AM to 5:45AM) in Italy the season end at 10AM
---
Ok fan boy
---
U are a bit lucky huh, congrats tho &gt;:)
---
Lmao I’m 13k plus and nowhere near maxed but having this outlook is just sad. Some people play the game FOR FUN and don’t care about tryharding. When I play with friends we just mess around and do dumb stuff, which is why some of them have maxed brawlers at low trophy levels. Even if you win every game from 0-12k trophies that’s a lot of hours put into the game.
---
I found a guy using primo lol
---
Love your drawings, keep them coming
---
Wrong subreddit
---
Hey guys, i just made a new map.
---
What do u think about it?
---
Ahem rule no.5 do not post low effort posts.
---
Is this a high level post? Almost anyone who has more than 6k has a legendary.my profile is full of idc because i was going through controversial posts and those are always low effort
---
I think that this should be enough to report and ban that player.
---
God those tips got me in my feels. Is the game really that hard to understand to people? Like theses are basic tips that you should know. But sadly they would have to be said.
---
1000 st like!!
---
I did once. He actually accepted my friend request and turned out to be fun to talk to as well.
---
Thnx, and Happy Cakeday
---
Wait so you had a shit in the cubicle...
---
In boss fight, they could just make her normal turret without extra heath for this star power
---
Too OP!!
---
What are we looking at here?
---
Sorry 20k proplayer.
---
I dont wanted to bother you
---
Template.
---
She can have two turrets but can only deploy one with one super
---
Then why is your brawler so fucking Low trophies that’s why u are playing with noobs do u know there is trophy inflation probably ur a noob also
---
i love the face jessie is making
---
It is it’s just about whose skill is better
---
It's not the matchmaking. It is the players being stupid. The Colt was most likely the friend of the 3rd person and they cued up together with a random (you). Happens a lot. Sadly.
---
Omg that Crows
---
This clip made me happy, good job leon
---
About what
---
Jessie is 15
---
Awesome, amazing drawing
---
GONNA SPANK DAT ASSSSS
---
So. Awesome.
---
Same I hate that
---
He keeps the game running for the F2P’s. Idk why everyone makes P2W people seem so bad. Without them there would be no Brawl Stars.
---
Maybe they both do half the damage of a regular on and it one just let you control the map better or they both have 25% less damage and 35% less range maybe :D .
---
8-bit is more threatening than bandaid Shelly with super
---
I like to take my time when I’m pushing one out
---
You found this at area 51?cuz they all seem fine to me
---
I was as surprised as anyone. Must be the poop factor. “Know your audience!”
---
The feeling of when you win from some teamers is so good, then you usually are defeated by some guy who was waiting for the battle to end to steal the points and your life, but still, it is great
---
Not even sorry
---
Tick is the most fun and least cancerous thrower in game, his voice makes me want to play him more, his star power makes him regen his health very quickly
---
Lovely stuff.
---
Why are you hyped?
---
Wow I'm speechless
---
This is the kind of shit people on creepypasta sites would have written about in 2012. Nice
---
Do power cubes actually spawn during boss fights? Or am I just playing normal and hard?
---
I

Can you help me? I'm stuck at insane 1
---
Nope
---
fbi open up
---
No, I saw this like the minute it came out
---
I'm guilty
---
Lol
---
The name of the game is the last of us, left behind,
---
I love that game
---
We have to keep the "below 40%" Star Powers for Bull
---
What is rang?
---
The 1k person to like this
---
How?
---
If people team to take down a larger foe then it's a solid strategy, but if it's mass teaming or just equally powered brawlers in a 2v1 then it's just scummy
---
Here's a tip use lucky parcher  uninstall and install the editing app from the app and then go to the app again you can get the watermark removal for free and you still get the video ignore Google play or the appstore stopping you it does no harm
---
Removed. Rule 3. No providing information on how to break Supercell Terms of Service.
---
He spinned after killing him. That's being toxic imo.
---
Themes in the game might be a good idea. Me, being a lover of blue, I like it now. But some may like red, purple, green, black, etc.
---
r/lostredditors
---
Not really. Also spinning to team is wayyy more toxic.
---
About rum ham, apparently. Whatever that is.
---
Not unless you're in the middle.
---
Agreed, that's not even toxic, more stupid if you ask me.
---
8 bits
---
Umm thats the bug with friendly boss battle dude?
---
Then what trophy count and what card levels?
---
The german word for rank.. but that isn't what I meant haha
---
You have become the very thing you swore to destroy!
---
Where os that from?
---
command block can be 8-bit, zombie as puncher bot, skeleton as sniper bot, brown panda can be bruce, weak panda can be shiba inu, silverfish as mouse bot, and bedrock can be the unbreakable blocks of the old robo rumble
---
[deleted]
---
Awh fuck awh shit awh god now what am I gonna do ;-;
---
Shut up thx
---
It's now 550. They made it just so everyone can keep his brawlers at 500 and get comfortable there. The reset starts now at Rank 21
---
Is**
---
This is the first time I've seen a Mortis fight that hard. I understand they have an advantage over throwers like Dynamike, but I always see them run away with their attack lol
---
ALL THE POWER CUBES
---
Yep I actually think it's fitting on bull
---
2 turrets but shots dont bounce?
---
Idea megaaaaas
---
it’s like how op old Bandaid was, but on steroids
---
Just shake. Just fucking shake.
---
Supercell did in CoC ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
*sad El primo noise*
---
I think 11k is too early. Maybe 14 or 15k.
---
You deserve all the upvotes.
---
This should be called third wheel
---
Original joke right here.
---
See you in hot
---
Neither.  Just dodge Colt’s shots, and then save ur super for a better situation.
---
They start at insane
---
So timing it perfectly you could solo win a game of siege
---
I mean, he looks less retarded. But he still has that waddle.
---
Did you mean to say "see you in Hell"
---
Traduction to portuguese please
---
Literally ppl need to start playing duo showdown as a TEAM!! I only play with randoms but OMG the ppl I have played with needs to redo the Shelly tutorial ffs.
---
For example: don’t rush out if u are low health, just because u have tons of power cubes doesn’t mean they can’t kill u... 
---
(Or maybe don’t rush into the middle and try to 1 vs 4...?
---
Dude you scared me xD
---
It's strange that when they were introduced there have been dozens of posts with hundreds of upvotes about how they were trash.. and now this comment is getting downvoted.
---
Things really change
---
❄/jce\❄
---
I didn’t even realise I was getting downvotes. Gosh, people must be jealous they never experienced Portrait
---
Once on siege i played 3 times with the same randoms. Needless to say i lose all those 3 games...
---
Fish maybe.
---
PLAYING AS PENNY
---
I thought that was pretty cool when I first got to that level. But I never get any. Teammates always take 'em.
---
You worded it wrong
---
So, you know how there's an option to search by hot? Posts in hot obviously have a lot of upvotes, so I'm saying that I will see this post when I'm looking through hot.
---
Sniping's a good job mate.

Your the one who is retarded. When you sharp your art with otherd and its not yours, your supposed to credit the original artist. Plus, he copied TWO artworks from TWO different people are you SO DUMB that you do not realize the Facebook copier copied the artwork from other people when it's not theirs and they didnt even credit them?

Who wants to buff crow? I like him the way he is. I feel like that's gonna have an opposite effect and they're gonna nerf crow, which we DON'T need.
---
All right, i'll delete the post.
---
Upvote for expanding brain format. Will always be one of my favorite memes.
---
I don’t like this it’s not physically possible
---
I actually want to see remodeled pam...
---
stop posting about friendly boss fight glitch لو سمحت
---
This is cool but I think this should be in the summer vacation so if when people have tick they could have this for free
---
yeah problem is that all my brawlers are 500+ so it's a tad annoying if this keeps happening.
---
I know, thats why its worse than the band-aid thing, as a player without crow, he gats real annoying and a buff is another thing I DONT need.
---
Least cancerous? I hate the way Tick waddles and they're like Leons: they don't leave you alone.
---
Still, I am looking forward to unlocking him.
---
Jprd żaden z tamtych skinów by nie wyglądał fajnie w grze chyba że by miał zmirnione wszystko i kosztował by 500 gemów
---
It’s like...a mating call
---
L…L…L
---
I see big things for this meme
---
Happened to me some times. Once I jumped with primo im brawlball like that and opponents scored. Some day I missed my super as barley on heist, and some day I shot colt super to nowhere ;-;
---
Not how you use the format ahhhhh
---
Can someone say why they put that on they names?
---
Bunny penny is adorable
---
True. What would you say is the best combo?
---
When did you start?
---
if this don't  make it to meme review i will be disappointed
---
He made a legendary brawler meme… but everybody is talking about his image quality 😂
---
XD jesteś aż tak nirdojebwany że musisz robić z tego go spam
---
2dinamikes at 100 trophies XD
---
:C
---
Other comment has a Leon flair
---
Close enough
---
Disgustingly OP, imagine such thing in modes like brawl ball or Big Game. No....
---
I feel you man...
---
I used darryl's super on the shelly i was trying to run away once
---
Please nobody gives a fuck, there's no difference
---
*sad gamer noises :C*
---
I'm part of the crow.
---
Yeah couz you start playing since it was released
---
Oh no it's you again spaming 10 old Beach with 18 brawlers at 2 trophies
---
Not me, im a lucky bastard, got crow on week 1 of the beta, bought leon with a 15$ offer and got spike pne box after buying leon x)
---
Boa mano! Mito! Arte top demais!
---
*confused screaming*
---
But you're 8- bit! How long did it take for you to type all that?
---
Why, why are you spaming this shit on Reddit
---
Yeah but unlike barley or high skill dynas you cant win a close up 1v1 as a tick
---
Happy Cakeday
---
this is not cursed it is blessed.
---
Idk how nobody wants to hold supercell accountable for allowing this to continuously occur and ruin the game for what I could only guess with be tens of thousands of people.
---
OP : you must be so embarrassed
---
The spike is a bad random
---
Yeah you can push litterally any brawler to 800+ in sd right now ok? Not Shelly's fault if the trophy system is broken ok sweetie?
---
bc he's good at the game. he doesn't need noob strat
---
Lmao
---
holy crap i was fucking clenchin hard the whole time
---
that must've been stressful but very satisfying in the end
---
been playing beta since day 1, dude landscape is so much better like what the fuck
---
I understand you it do it to me too
---
I like animals because I being kind to them
---
Repost
---
It reminds me of a meme template. The cute doggo is jessie normally while the horrible beast is jessie in big game
---
i will be sad if it dies cause it is the most satisfying map i made
---
Trophies don't matter or mean anything these days.... It's just grinding.... There are pure shitty players i get matched up with. Im at about 15k.
---
Yeah so we can make it summer team beach brock and beach tick and beach jessie
---
it just started doing this to me a few days ago it’s so annoying.
---
Robo rumble is once a month now
---
Thats like so retarded why would they do that
---
That Is very true
---
Idk i don't like it too it is my favorite ticket event :(
---
Hey listen up don't stay there complaining do something
---
Mortis vs 3 throwers
---
You talking about the event button? https://ibb.co/6RJMw2p If so I still cant find the default game mode
---
*loud tick noises*
---
You’re so lucky!
---
Eye of the storm 2?
---
You Been complaining all of that match why are you blaming them when you didn't do shid
---
You poor things..
---
Legendary are the most unique. Crow has poison. Spike has a cactus grenade that shoots out spikes.
---
Leon can become invisible and kill people. Unlike trophie road brawlers who use a shotgun or just shoots in a straight line
---
Sometimes sorting by new is not a bad thing! Well done OP, it looks awesome!
---
"He just got clapped and he's coming back for more" -wonderbrad
---
Lol anyone could have their name at kairostimeyt
---
Crow is too map dependent. Leon isn't
---
No one's fucking complaining
---
Dang, thank you very much!
---
Spike is the best IMO
---
Nah, what I say is true, you don’t even need boxes you just have to have money to get good in the game, supercell is bullshit I love their games but they just care about money
---
Why is there no airborne El Primo (you know the joke)
---
I do 3 in gg to get all the gems in one person
---
and saying he only had 450 trophies i highly doubt it
---
Dude you're acting like you've never used Leon. Try using him in any open showdown map at 500 trophies and hope you don't get sniped by the 4 pipers hiding in the bushes.
---
WHAT?
---
I laughted way too hard for this.
---
Well, Supercell confirmed that they're working on an El Primo remodel right now.
---
Yeah and I still feel dirty cause of it :(
---
Ha this is great. I love the explosion and everything, all I would offer as critique is piper looks really realistic and it’s kinda weird, and Jessie looks too blurry but overall very cool
---
Amazing
---
thanks to everyone for being so nice!
---
I like when this post talked about Brawl Stars. Oh wait.....
---
Im**n o t**

Sacrifice to give your teammate more powercubes then wait until you respawn. Stonks.

You must have opened a lot of boxes lol

My man. It's not my fault you cant use Leon correctly.
