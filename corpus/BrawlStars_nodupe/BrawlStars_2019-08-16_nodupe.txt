The gedikor you wrote doesn't seem that popular
---
---
---
Either he waited for an opportunity or got angry because you guys were trash
---
The sad part about this he gets trophies and theres nothing you can do
---
Opentoonz. Probably the best possible free animation software out there.
---
Just a dumbass camping at enemy spawn thinking they could ambush them and kill them.
---
Lol you suck at the game if you can barely afford 160 starpionts lol
---
I mean you‚Äôre a fucking spike just rushing in and getting obliterated within a second
---
Come back when somebody scores to your team
---
Thanks :)
---
No. Watch the video again, he simply ran to the enemy spawn and did his best to hide until they forgot he was there. Even when countdown began for the enemy team he did nothing.
---
Don't say:Tara or Gene is gonna see the future and seeing everybody dying after giving their bests.But the only brawler which survives will be Leon.Get it?After everyone dies Leon turns visible again and then it starts that song when you lose the match.And he sees all the brawl stars universe.(from Kairos)
---
Dynamike dyna jumps over wall and water and feels safe
---
Yeah but he did it on purpose and didn‚Äôt even try to kill them when they ran back.
---
?????
---

---
He was the one doing nothing the entire game and expecting his teammates to 2v3???
---
Price of what?
---
Thank you, this means a lot. I love animating and frankly, I don't think I'll ever stop. I'm already working on my next one
---
Hope you can accomplish anything you're working for too.
---
Nice
---
[removed]
---
Probably because he originally tried to get them on their way back and when he saw you were trash he just gave up
---
This happened to me in siege i got a phone call then came back and it said 0 
---
And i was like (# bruh)
---
Maybe we are xD xD ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
No
---
Used to be that way... back in my day
---
r/ihadastroke
---
But you lowkey wasted their trophies by being utter shit
---
This would have worked so much better when the game was portrait
---
Anima»õia lui Bratu:))
---
Ik i try make them stop but they keep doing it
---
Madea lol
---
Donghoon u r amazing
---
A super rare brawler that can one shot  a brawler you get at 4000 trophies.hes like bull except he shoots twice and his super is bulls super except he bounces of walls and basically has infinite range if on water.
---
Same trophies?
---
Thanks!!!
---
You do know you don‚Äôt have to play with randoms right?
---
Rico would have fitted better
---
I didn‚Äôt say he did anything good but neither did his teammates and they would have probably lost anyway judging how the spike played
---
Is it ‚Äúper dagger +100‚Äù for crow?
---
You can‚Äôt actually see that far down the map when you are at the top of the screen like he was. Also a 2v3 is a huge disadvantage. 
---
I don‚Äôt take advice from noobs that are at 2k trophies like yourself.
---
Man looks like B.E.N from treasure planet.
---
Yes its ugly
---
Search by tag would be a great feature
---
Damn ur entitled. Stop whining like the immature 12 year old u are and get used to life. You can‚Äôt always win.
---
*Give him a diamond reward*
---
Rey i have a question for you.....do you think that Mortis is ok rn with Coiled Snake or you think that he needs a little bit more?(No nerfs pls)....Check out my profile,900 last season XD.
---
Hey Rey! Just wanted to say love your vids and positive attitude. If you could go on an all expense paid trip anywhere in the world, where would you go? 
---
Keep up the great work!
---
You saw a fair bit and you also saw a certain spike dying over and over in the corner
---
Ur name is jothan, u weren‚Äôt even in the game. I know ur in game name by post history.
---
#hey thats mine give it back to me
---
#never knew that
---
Eww put it back on pls
---
But he have bounces, right?
---
Cool. I saw him in game, he looks cool as well.
---
Penis
---
And for the people that like to play with randoms? New players that queue up with randoms 100% of the time? It‚Äôs fair to those players to only have 1 teammate?

 oofed reuploading with tick and gene

*I'm around 6.5k and I dont even have a mythic yet, but you get legendary at 650 trophies*
---
Cool shot
---
These are so true. I feel like the poco one should also be uses his super right after you die to try and heal you
---
There's nothing wrong in using a format, but the way he used it is definitely unoriginal and low-effort.
---
How‚Äôd you know it was heist? There is nothing here that can indicate that this was on heist.
---
It's actually stronger than u think....
---
In higher ranks 3v3 is whats played more atleast to my knowledge
---
Yeah, his reload already allows him to place mines as soon as they explode but now it's just gonna be an unrelenting barrage of mines.
---
Finding this art is like finding a hidden unlockable in a game. Applause for being the first to include Crow in Batch 4 :)
---
Even if he succeeded he would‚Äôve wasted his super. Don‚Äôt understand why people do this. But hey, it worked out for you.
---
Even though he didnt need a buff.
---
Yes thank you
---
Bo's star power would be soo op lol
---
Otherwise he'd be op right? Which is why we dont buff ticks health or reload.
---
Nice eyeshadow there
---
That's a scary thought.
---
I know those guys, i saw them on the youtube channel called Aurum
---
I'm sorry it was my idea for him to make El tick ;&lt;
---
that makes Peis
---
Yes, last april
---
Thank you! üòä
---
Subspace Emissary &gt; World of Light 
---
change my mind
---
Yeah he can already push out mines as soon as they are a put to disappear, now he can just keep sending them...
---
Supercell needs to nerf how long they stay on the ground...
---
Adidas leon or tri paloski
---
Thsi could actually be a thing
---
You still have plenty of time to redo the frame if you‚Äôd like using a PC ;)
---
when you steal their power cube and they keep hunting you for the whole match
---
I don‚Äôt have one sadly. This is the best I could do!
---
No u
---
First few games i played it was the old trophy system. It got a lot easier when they released the new system. Bush camped many brawlers before i knew how to use them correctly

How do you usually go by your ratings on your meme reviews? Also why do you skip some that show when you are reading the title but don‚Äôt review it?

Tbh I was hoping they‚Äôd add another Subspace Emissary in Ultimate following the one in Brawl :‚Äô(

---
Did he really I mean it's funny and all but when the bubble starts spawning just shot the ball jeez my teammets did the same thing but we still didn't lose but our poco scored on our goal because he was thinking that we can beat the other team and then we lost what an legends
---
I think 3rd and 4th in solo SD should also give a club token, since they give a star token normally.
---
 I don't think they are going to fix anything, besides brawl talk won't be coming out for a while. I say you should just open them
---
Honestly, the bad editing makes it better
---
Are you going to get the supercell team to pin this AMA? They don‚Äôt seem to have noticed yet.
---
Where do we write about idea that should be in Brawl stars
---
Yeah I'm kidding obviously. And anyway I assumed you'd understand that that obviously wouldn't be a smart idea anyway
---
My chances are like 0.0864 percent

so very true

thank for compliment. mortis always kill dyna
---
Boom absolute thorough truth that supercell lief its not trophy based its whatever matchmaking feels like... For all those sticklers out there lol ik he's in a party with bibi and match making is matching based on her cup count get off my case!
---
Real strategy in brawl ball
---
On behalf of Barleys I apologize for those disgraces. They will be sent to the gulag immediately.
---
r/woooosh
---
No , wat bout u?
---
The amount of tokens need to level up should scale by the size of the club
---
Rey, I read in a comment that you watch Anime, I'd greatly recommend Demon Slayer: Kimetsu No Yaiba. It's one of the hot animes recently.
---
Also with Dynamike, if he‚Äôs my teammate then they auto aim and dies the first one but the enemy Dynamike literally has an aim of a god!!
---
I mean, 100 sounds good for 1st lv, but each level they should increase by like 25 tokens, so like lv 5 eould cost 200 tokens, and 50 instead of 25 for last lv.
---
what does it mean literally?
---
Tastier than oreo
---
But why tho... it‚Äôs not like having autoaim on would hurt you when you play if you‚Äôre a manual aiming player
---
Smack attack!
---
legend says bot is better than randoms
---
Poco's screeching solo is legit good for him, I forgot it existed until i got team wiped twice by him in Gem Grab.
---
Yea but what it means in that sense is that your going to get 10 boxes worth of coins and power point. In terms of chances for a brawler/star power 10 regular boxes give you 30 chances (3 slots per box) for a brawler or star power but a single mega box only has 6 chances for a brawler/star power
---
Shut up bro, you're not cool because you can put the letter "r" and a slash mark before something.

The OP's first language is clearly not English, and he already apologized for bad grammar. Why are you being toxic for the sake of being toxic?

Welcome to mortis gang
---
Its a good idea, but a bit too expensive, as these are 160 trophies that we r indirectly giving which are equal to 20 victories in 3v3=4000 tokens=40 boxes out of which we can get even 800 coins üòí. 
---
Just rough calculation according to me, but still very expensive.
---
Mmm massage
---
Remove the N theirs gonna be another earthquake in California

nope

1-3 bullets, which is enough to stop you from healing

A skilled mortis and an equally skilled colt have a 50/50 chance of killing each other

THIS NEEDS MORE UPVOTES. JUST ADD A REPORT BUTTON LIKE IDEC ABOUT OVERWATCH. I like this idea from csgo but maybe no gems rewarded or people will abuse.
---
# ME 42069
---
Sakura spike is a cyclops
---
Is this real?
---
I think you should be able to buy boxes, not power points for star points because it'd make way too easy for people who don't care about skins to max out
---
Oof, piper probably realized from the getgo that her team was crap, and just said Ef it. Been there‚Äôs before tbh
---
Maybe make it so you have to participate a certain amount in order to unlock the rewards?
---
No, 50 active members, everyone 20 wins in 3 days and you got the level 10 chest. Some people get that amount of wins in one day.
---
Nah you wanna push against them in mid as long as you can, and then start retreating when they get in
---
Nothing worse than getting cornered against the wall and then getting wiped by a well placed dynamike barrel, and watching mortis escape with all the gems
---
Also need to pay attention to the score, if the diff is only 2 gems apart (i.e. 10-8) they can camp mid and tie the game to cancel the countdown
---
"People are too fragile" BAHAHAHAHA good one
---
Great! Crow was my first leggie too but i got him at 2k.qp
---
you ruined tha joke

M8 if they add this i will litteraly see u as a god and i will start a new religion with you as its Greatest Brawl God

Yeah until you get team mates that blow a 7-0 gem lead and you sre needed on the battlefield
---
Da, sal :))))
---
You dropped this: \
---
I‚Äôd make a first in solo showdown worth 2 keys and second worth 1, it‚Äôs much easier to get 3v3 wins quicker than solo wins so this would balance it out a little. Otherwise, fantastic concept
---
But did u lose or gain trophies if it happend
---

Views+followers=money. Open your eyes kids, these YouTubers just want money that‚Äôs it. If there was no money in ads and views you wouldn‚Äôt hear a peep from any of these guys.

Knowing you‚Äôre just trying to make money off these kids. Pretending to be nice to them. How about you go find a gun and shoot all 3 of you in the head. And then give me all the money you make off these kids and their views. Muah muahhh muuuuaahahaahah

Hello Rey hope ur having and absolutely fantastic kick butt day in today's video; that sentence is stuck in my head lol. I really wanna know if it's worth it to invest 30$ worth of gems on a single legendary  and what's ur second favourite brawler after mortis.
---
Lol i made the SAME JOKE like a month ago and nobody cared, it's all about the time you upload it.
---
Repost why did this get 1k upvotes??? This community is failing badly
---
Oh i know it i was just talking about auto-aim
---
But every one needs to get at least a number of Chest Tokens. Or afk players will get a box whit out having done any match. What number can be?
---
Pls supercell
---
yes, but is different! That count! :)
---
I got two mythic and legendary and my of getting anything is so low :(
---
I don't get it why people don't play defensively if we have 1 star more OK then just start playing defensive and will be fine but no they rush in into em
---
My god this is wrong on so many levels.

First time?

I lost trophies

Thank uüòä

Super obvius and super old REEEEEEEEEE

This is the correct answer. 2 gold for every 1 power point.

I wish if they make anything to makes clubs useful

Crow DPS is the not problem his hp is the real deal
---
Thank you so much, bro!
---
That‚Äôs not dumb at all. Storage and servers cost money to run. If you expanded replays to all brawlers, it would bog the game down massively or it would no longer be f2p. With trophy inflation, it‚Äôs become much easier to unlock replays. Like seriously...2 hours on a brawler is about all it takes if you‚Äôre half competent.
---
Does anyone think the animation is gonna be for the big announcement
---
Aww man
---
Dude same on me, i got every brawler on power 9, still missing like 20 starpowers to be maxed and got 20k gold.. every 5-6 days 1 starpower in my shop :)))) love it
---
Yeaahhhh, that would be really cool :3 Thx

Am I too late

the bunny penny don't have losing animation, so when u lose it's just flash a lil lose animation then go to the wining one

ok... i dont like to be mean but its not good but what i can do is give you criticism so first of all the way you made her breast does not look right you can look at other tara fan art and stuff second of all is the way her hands work they look weird and the other eye looks very wrong where is the pupil if its meant not to be there then make it more obvious then just leaving it there either than body proportions its fine ive seen your other art and they basically have the same mistakes so try and improve on that and everything will be fine
---
Got it after loong time

Good one, if this is added I'll totally want that 1000 beauty's

I will be happy if they add this and good idea

It was in Clash Royale it was in some way in CoC (Clan Games) so why not in Brawl Stars it's a good idea

i think this is due to his poor design as an assassin in general as well as the current meta. he is supposed to chip n then one shot with his dive, but his dive is not reliable especially in 3v3 where active healing n basic dodging exists, and walls just prevent him from even getting damage or super charge in. he is an assassin with **no guaranteed way out**, unless he uses his super as that way out.
---
sure he is one of the better duelists in the game, but that is dependent on his super being up, n that takes a while to charge unless a tank runs at u n ur able to get 9 hits on him. someone like Carl does a lot better in the current meta at being a supposed assassin, being more resistant to poke, more dmg played properly, n a way in AND out played properly.
---
i used to b a crow main, but with how the meta is n his inherent design there isn't a solution in sight to bring him to a healthy spot.
---
i can't unsee this now thank you

This subreddit has honestly fallen. People are making overused, low quality memes and posts and there‚Äôs no sign of it stopping. Please stop contributing to the demise of this subreddit.

Well, I reached 7k before trophy change. But you shouldn't disrespect too calling people stupid just for having a good amount of trophies that *YOU* think is low.

Great but, 9 brawl boxes are better than a mega box regarding brawler or sp chances
---
Also, 1 or 2nd place in ssd is too limited

If you didn't understand what's happening here, Gene is the only brawler I don't own.

There already is none. You can be completely f2p. There's no reason to spend money Unless it's something limited

Then how is Shelly op if she can be sniped down by any good player... not a good argument

You invalidate your own argument so next try to read or even think before replying. Only a noob like you think she is op because when ever you get too close to her and get one shot you automatically think she is op even though it‚Äôs generally your fault that she was that close to you in the first place

No hate but you sound like those youtube comments  ,,like if you agree''. But yeah, i agree with you

---
Here's a bit of stats :
---
Only 1% of the players are above 11k trophies.
---
Within this 1%, there must be very few people who are queuing with you at the same time to get into the map you selected (probably 0.1%).
---
Which means 0.001% of the player base you would like to be matched into is queuing. That is not enough.
---
So, either you accept to wait 2 to 3 minutes on average everytime you want to play, or supercell shortens that time and matches you with randoms around 6k trophies.
---
Although I would like to have more fairness in the matchmaking. I would hate to wait 3 minutes. How about you?

It‚Äôs meteor rush. Apparently it works with both attacks and supers.

Supercell needs to fix stuff, I had all brawlers at 6k tropies, and this dude doesn't have all of them at 12k. It feels bad when ppl higher tropies than me ask how many brawlers I have left to unlock.

Organised teaming... Basically high trophy brawl stars in showdown

Perfectly possible

I don‚Äôt think that YouTube views determine the success of a mobile game. Clash Royale makes more income, has a higher player base, and arguably a better dev team (more of an opinion). We also have no way of telling is brawl stars will sink or rise in popularity in the future as-well.
---
I probably have hundreds of houses more on brawl stars than clash royale, but I just think that CR as of now isn‚Äôt dead and is more successful than BS.
---
No problem Sam, and I have an idea for a skin, but since I'm bad at any form of art, Im going to say it here: Pam - Teenage Pam, the skin is about Pam looking instead of a mid 30's mom, she looks like a teen that just started engineering (still looks a bit older than Jessie or Penny), if you do or dont make the skin, no worries and thanks anyways, and again Your art is really good
---
well, it is 5:35 PM in Helsinki, so that's very weird...

Thank you!

Sry to ruin it but you are gonna go through A tough time without 6 shotting box in showdown
---
Nope
---
The plus one lvl might not be the best since people can make a mini and lvl up on there
---
Nah, the concept just doesn't fit, supercell made skins only buyable from the shop for a reason, this would basically be like being able to buy the skin from the brawler profile.
---
When you get him?

Its just a color remake so a big waste of money

If you have sound on, you can hear meteor rush‚Äôs sound effect whenever mortis uses his dash. Meteor rush doesn‚Äôt stack, but it gets renewed whenever mortis dashes. Bibi‚Äôs home run star power is permanent when you use it with any other brawler.

I'm not supposed to give my own opinion
---
But give it a try and then you can tell me if it's fun or not
---
Not convinced yet?
---
Ok, I'll cut you a deal
---
The game is available for free
---
And that's a great price
---
We need one for brawl ball too
---
This mode is a 5v1 mode with 5 normal brawlers and 1 higher health (not nearly as much as hunting party) and higher damage (maybe half of hunting party) brawler. They all have respawn and the time is maybe 3:00. The way for big to win is to get the star and the way for normals to win is to defend the star for set time. (or maybe time reward as both like hunting party) I think this is a great mode already but would love suggestions as to how to balance the mode and maybe even more maps for it.
---
(P.S. Forgot spawns for blue, they would be at bottom)
---
Or a sledgehammer
---
O siema sitr0x :)
---
Well heres some advice from me who has tried blue hair.
---
Dont dye your hair aqua or light blue if you hair is brown only if its dark brown but lets say your hair was regular brown and you were to dye it dark blue thats kind of grayish aswell then it would look pleasing.
---
Im currently at blonde and it has been for a long time for now! Titanium or white would also look pleasing

Lol it‚Äôs his new shin
---
I think it's with Piper's Star Power, Snappy Sniping... When one of Leon's spinners hits the safe, he reloads 0.5 ammo. Each attack has 4 spinners so he reloads 2 ammo for every attack basically (if all spinners hit a target).
---
There was actually a map like that back then but I think it got removed.
---
Ouch, you got served, I mean it could be worse
---
Sure he‚Äôs not !
---
no idea
---
i bet coach cory sees this
---
If somehow you manage to buy or get a skin gifted, for a brawler that you don't have, you automatically get the brawler unlocked
---
Funny because I pulled crow at level 7
---
WHY R U RUNNIG???

guys i'm literally shaking and crying rn

love this giveaway . worth waiting all day hope i win. my idea for subreddit is to connect it with brawl stars so that we can directly post our best games directly to subreddit with out using any other video recording app . At the end CONGO ,CONGO ,CONGO

Hello forever Brawl Stars
---
You poor thing
---
Quests must come to brawl stars.This my idea.I hope me win.
---
with trophy change these rewards are much more useful
---
An idea for the subreddit? Mh.. maybe new meme template
---
I think it would be best to limit different classes of posts to a weekly basis (e.g. shitpost Saturday, fan art Friday, team building Tuesday). The alliteration and post type limitations are just a suggestion.
---
miss* u didn't dodge anything..
---
:D
---
Seems not relevant to what I said. I think it‚Äôs cool as well. But being able to buy the stuff if(when) you don‚Äôt win would be nice.
---
See yall in hell
---
I think it would be a good idea to make more art competitions,since there is a lot of talented players in our community
---
I feel cheated ‚ÄúBig announcement‚Äù...... small giveaway
---
*We'll be right back meme song plays*
---
I also have 12.6k and 24 brawlers no legendary
---
I would personally love to see if the devs would anwser be a bit more active on Reddit. Like responding to some controversial posts or something. It would be also nice to have a weekly post from the devs just like cr has it.
---
Memes, their amount here is a problem, people see low effort posts and upvote them instead of concepts that would make game even better than now. Less memes, more concepts and ideas, thats it. Congrats on 200k btw
---
post vid flair and QnA flairs and i think it needs a meme subreddit to divide gameplay and memes stuff
---
*laugs cause he has no legendaries but wants to itigrate*
---
I want official gangs!
---
My idea is have more fan art. I think a lot of us would also love competitions or giveaways. Even a weakly challenge you put out and people record gameplay and post it and moderators pick the best post and the winner gets some merch or a few in game gems.
---
I love this very much

You should do a skin making competition of some kind and have the winning skin added to the game

Also a video flair for posts would be neat
---
Bibi the real Star Player
---
Make the sorting easier. For example, see what‚Äôs trending/rising today
---
In my opinion, having a greater variety of tags/subtags for posts (eg. The 'discussion' tag could have subtags such as 'game design' or 'comps') would be useful , so it's easier to find the things you want.

Sadly I played brawl stars just after the update that changed the brawlers

The worst brawler is crow by far, I hate having one of my team

Penny's star power is to put Sriracha sauce on your balls

Crow

Okay

What your point??

I would fix Siege to it‚Äôs original state, however I would make the trophy gain and loss like any other 3v3. I would also allow both Robots to spawn at the same time, with the same amount of levels, but they don‚Äôt cross paths. The IKE turret will have to be buffed in damage to balance this.

Probably bad internet

**supercell* this is perfectly balanced and so much effort put in

Maybe like a 1v1 cause that would be good cause I see everyone with their own idea about an 1v1 and most of them are about maps. So that would be good.

Hello, congratulations for 200,000!!!!!! One thing that would improve the subreddit is more interesting topics to talk about and more interactive activities/ events hosted every month maybe.

We also need less overuse memes and things like that but none of us have control over that because KIDS
---
(i had to use the discord emote system to avoid an emojipolice)
---
The subreddit could use some more tips and tricks on brawl stars , or maybe reddit can link with brawl stars and upload or download custom maps as well as maybe implementing events or tournaments hosted on reddit and played on bS
---
Idea or suggestion... 
---
Keep doing what your doing things seem great too me
---
Instead of memes people should start doing brawler guides for new players so it's easy for them to understand as the current game tutorial is basically useless.

Guys, im shaking.

I think this subreddit is in a good shape. But one idea or wish is that to be able to sort the content by tags. Like if I only want to see memes, then filter content by humor tag.

One suggestion for the game: improve brawl tv, by providing the option to select the game mode we want to see. I really do not enjoy watching people play robo rumble in the weekends. And those matches last 6 good minutes.

Thank you.

There should be more conests for art, videos, and ideas. Also a cool thing for the game would be club wars but thats probably a long shot

Hmmm.... I never see the title of a meme as part of a meme but you may be right.
---
Weekly interviews with top players
---
Would rather file this under new brawler ideas! Imagine rooting players and chucking razor leafs
---
Why are you defending this? Of course everyone is going to think its game related. Most of everyone in this community are probably kids. I‚Äôm not a kid and I also thought it was game related and I‚Äôm not the only one. They could have easily just said it was a giveaway or a Reddit announcement. Saying it‚Äôs common sense isn‚Äôt a good excuse.
---
My suggestion would be: Organizing weekly Brawl tournaments on the subreddit with prizes (gems, skins, etc). Also more GIVEAWAYS!
---
Um... you are using a Rico flair, pal
---
Jajaja !

this subreddit could use a place to go when you wanna find some teammates to get a good comp in a fast and easy way !
---
r/engrish
---
the brawl stars community is 69% corrupt. you should try harder.
---
Ummm??
---
What?
---
Your post has been removed, make sure to use the body of a post to elaborate on the title.
---
Here's a good one. Hereeee's Johnny
---
Idea: Try Parade Float Carl that‚Äôll be cool, I couldn‚Äôt draw that so it‚Äôd be cool if u could
---
Something I would like to see in this subreddit is a developer commenting on idea posts and giving their thoughts on it.
---
To be honest, it might be better to use Penny's cannon behind her base because then it has insane area control, rather than something like 8% to the IKE.
---
he* then^^
---
have a suggestion/skin contest in wich the most upvoted and loved by supercell devs will be chosen for a future update
---
Here is an idea add more gold into the game ü§î
---
Yes please this will be challenging I like it
---
Lmao I know
---
I was just joking
---
They‚Äôre testing it to see wat they can fix and improve. They lose nothing by keeping it but I still think apex is a team game and inhate solos
---
According to the bottom text, it's Shelly, Penny and Barley. Why do people play Shelly on Heist, that's so sad.
---
‚ÄúUpcoming‚Äù flair for anything related to hints that would be useful around brawl talk time
---
r/emojipolice, come with me
---
Post flairs-more stuff like this!-and of course more talk with mods devs and that's all!
---
Glad you like it! I plan on making some more.
---
I‚Äôm in this post and I don‚Äôt like it
---
NEW GAME MODE ?!ü§î
---
Only not in Nintendo switch and cellphone
---
An idea i‚Äôve had for awhile now was community proposed balance changes where the community votes on a character to have changes and then votes on those changes to their stats or other features. This would happen weekly and it makes it so Supercell can see what alot of players think of where a character is in terms of viability. Now to balance things out players would vote along with thier user id so trophies can be taken into account. Every Sunday a group of similar characters would be put up for voting ex: Pam Poco or Gene with voting ending on Wednesday. On Thursday voting for whether or not the character needs a buff or nerf. Friday is where people vote on what is changed like Health, Attack, Super, or Star Power. On Saturday people will vote on how much the stat is changed. I know its complex and kinda of a stretch but its a great way to get the community involved better.

Shut up, you‚Äôre coming with us
---
Siege coming
---
Right
---
This is correct üëÜüëÜ
---
any suggestions?
---
Only neef the legendarys at 7000.
---
So I think pretty normal
---
My idea is that Supercell should host a contest for designing a new skin. Artists would post their entries, Supercell would preselect a few (5?), and the community would vote for their favorite. The most voted one should make it into the game.
---
Maybe a little more link with the BS team to make them look, comment and discuss about ideas on this sub!
---
Otherwise, I feel it's fine üëç
---
Cool
---
You are very unlucky
---
Hope I win.
---
One suggestion is to have upvote and downvote icons like the Clash Royale SR
---
MCDONALDS DARRYL
---
MCDARRYL
---
That would be way too strong. He'd be Nita, but with more range and 25% more damage, and still have his Super pull. Personally I'd just give his six magic puffs 300 damage each.

Less memes, higher quality content posts
---

It would actually maybe make more sense, as the map would open up fairly quickly (hopefully) and then the map would be shaped by which grass you destroy
---

This was a very creative, high effort post that doesn‚Äôt consist of only the spam of a collection of pixels.
---
There should be a specific time each week where people can make suggestions for new Brawlers/Skins/balance changes etc....
---
