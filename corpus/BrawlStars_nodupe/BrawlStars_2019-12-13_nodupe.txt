You know in the picture u/brawlstars sent out, EMZ had those hearty eyes for our man poco.

ALSO WE DONT HAVE SANDY, EMZ, 8-BIT FLAIR, BO AND PRIMO IMAGE HAVE OLD PIC, BUT YOU THINK ONLY ABOUT PIPER

That's me

No, the link doesn't exist mate
---
No need for all caps tho :(
---
literally nothing besides coins and powerpoint... at least I got tix and token doubler
---
I liked the voice lines but I would still keep some argh's
---
I am confused but ok
---
I agree. I don‚Äôt even have one,but I could get every brawler to max except for emz.
---
I knew it would come to this...
---

---
I don‚Äôt want to sound mean, but o feel like you could have done a lot better.
---
This is inaccurate I'm 14.5k and have no where near all characters points
---
We need it to be a free brawler!
---
Ok
---
Yeah I know
---
14.5 and no legendary
---
We all know it‚Äôs gonna happen

I am happy

Same here, but i'm at 12000 trophies

I get nothing and then I get Tara right after in a normal box
---
Oh

**IT'S YOU**

Proceds to epicly point his finger at the camera
---
[deleted]
---
The same exact thing happens to me and my friends, say one of us has the highest amount of trophies with a brawler at 500, then the rival team will have around 600 each, if one of us has 600, they have 700. Tought we were the only ones having this issue!
---
Hey stop copying my comment ideas buddy

*Oh Ho!*

Oh...

I don‚Äôt like being mean, and I felt like what I said was very mean. 
---
I can be a total angry boi  if I am angry, but I am not angry, so being a angry boi isn‚Äôt easy...

It would atmost be an uncommon brawler

Frank‚Äôs is because it is 4 different projectiles
---
Not necessarily cards, more of Brawlers like the characters. There's points u get from them in boxes, like cards u get in chests. The goal is to get them to level 9 and then unlock a star power Wich is like a game changer, sort of like a new mechanic to help them! Play them strategic because the game is based on your skill on a battlefield rather than the placing strategy
---
Samd
---
Trophies are irrelevant. Just means you play the game. Getting brawlers is a matter of time. Ive played for 2  1/2 years to get all 4 legendaries.
---
Have the same problem, get trophies for after lose ir for useless points, the endgame content is shit.. I understand your pain because I feel the same
---
So cute!!
---
i think i have the pre-release skin... is that rare in any way?
---
this is cool
---
It wasn‚Äôt the rework that caused this. All shotgunners have this bug to some degree. This is because shotgun ‚Äúpellets‚Äù are actually clumps of pellets. In this case, the robot is directly between the hit boxes of 2 clumps of pellets, thus not taking damage. It is annoying and needs to be patched. Here are some of my solutions: either make the hit boxes more clear, give each pellet its own hit box, or tighten the spaces between each clump.
---
The final boss in brawl stars was harder than expected

It gets rare by the minute

So basically the the reddit fanbase is making some sort of love square where our favorite musician Poco is being adored by Piper, EMZ, and Penny.
---
It's that great to be famous!
---
Dude, that‚Äôs a perfect meme template!
---
It doesn‚Äôt ONLY happen with auto-aim... it also happens with manual aim.

I think you‚Äôre on to something

Where is normal mortis?

So sweet. I thank Supercell and YOU too.

It's magic üòèüòè

Why the hell would Poco be scared!!??

Hatless Poco tho

She‚Äôs a fricking child

---
hey i redownloaded it but i don‚Äôt know how to check my skins... i‚Äôm level 1 btw
---
She's a fricking teenager
---
Darryl also has 4 different projectiles, it is just less obvious because of the visible pellets. 
---
We know this because:
---
1.) Enemies can take no damage in some cases (due to being in between 2 projectiles).
---
2.) the MINIMUM amount of damage Darryl can do at Level 10 is 420. The MAXIMUM damage Darryl can do at Level 10 is 1680. 1680 divided by 420 is equal to 4. Thus, Darryl has 4 hit boxes per shotgun blast.
---
This is actually the cause of the visual bug. The enemy is standing in between two of Darryl‚Äôs hit boxes.
---
...o_o
---
Pretty sure the size is the same as a child
---
The size of Leon is a size for a teenager
---
Yeah, I also miss him, so I use this meme template

Honestly I feel like I could do slightly better than most people I see that use mortis but i can't test that till i get mortis
---
True
---
My friends all got crow I they now have two legendarys and I have none. I might quit
---
The game isn‚Äôt created for only you üôÑ
---
I‚Äôve been reading some comments with misinformation so I thought I‚Äôd shed some light;
---
ALL shotgunners have this bug to some degree. This is because shotgun ‚Äúpellets‚Äù are actually clumps of pellets. In this case, the robot is directly between the hit boxes of 2 clumps of pellets, thus not taking damage. 
---
In Darryl‚Äôs case, he shoots FOUR PROJECTILES with each shotgun. We know this because players can stand in between 2 projectiles to take 0 damage; this is why the bug occurs commonly with player who use auto-aim on still targets. 
---
For further proof that Darryl shoots 4 projectiles: Darryl can do a MINIMUM of 420 damage with one shotgun blast at Level 10. Darryl can do a MAXIMUM of 1,680 with one shotgun blast at Level 10. 1,680 divided by 420 is equal to 4, as in 4 projectiles. Hope this shed some light.
---
This visual bug is annoying and needs to be patched. Here are some of my solutions: either make the hit boxes more clear, give each pellet its own hit box, or tighten the spaces between each clump.
---
Go to brawlers tap on a brawler, if there are any arrows then it means you have a skin, also connect to supercell Id for free barley + skin.
---
Frick no, I‚Äôm not scared

Poco got that big cranium (because eve has no brain)

There is an optional update on Android to fix this. The devs have said it a couple times. If not going out of the app and back in when in the news tab fixes it temporarily.

Also the the thing beetwen me and my other classates is over and we are all friends again

Yes, but Brawl Stars is giving away much more valuable things, and the game is a lot less pay to win the CR.

I‚Äôm not saying they‚Äôre not in it for the money, because any game needs money, especially a free game, but, I‚Äôm just saying that they really care about their community much, much more than most mobile games.

I'm talking about how he explains it, its all in English, if we could meet up in real life, I would show u how dumb you are ffs. Go read the comment u came from, he literally said "I'm KOREAN" it's not Russian u dummy, the name means a group of many people drug dealing IN REAL LIFE

Its a fair price, for the best brawler in the game

I read them if there 1/10 players found

Penny thinks she's cute.

You are leon-ly one i need

Actually it is not bad :D
---
That was too good
---
Yes, but 100 is decent
---
That's great actually
---
Much better :)
---
And atleast that's something a lot better than nothing
---
I love this idea, as it would open up some new strategies for Rico, as aiming bounces differently so the first and last bullets always hit.
---
Well I Have Trash Wifi And This Always Happens, My Brawler Is Stuck At Spike But When I Press A Dif Brawler, Spike Just Stays On The Screen But When I Play It's Not Spike, Just Be Attentive To What Brawler You Tap Since I Know Now What Brawler I Tao So I Don't Play A Wrong Brawler, Hope This Gets Fixed Soon
---
cursed
---
Nope.
---
Dud you still dont get it IM SAYING SUPERCELL HAS MORE COMPLEX CODING AND REALEASES UPDATES EVERY MONTH WHILE MINCRAFT HAS NOT GOT THAT COMPLEX CODE AND GETS UPDATES EVERY 1 YEAR IM SAYING THAT SUPERCELL IS DOING MORE WORK IN 1 MONTH THAN MINECRAFT IN 2 YEARS
---
That would just multiply his dmg per bullet to 896. which becomes 4489 dmg per attack, and 10,752 damage per super if its included. that would one shot several brawlers, making Rico wayy too op.
---
Doesn‚Äôt really apply to this game. The problems are that trophy pushing is the only thing to do, and you can‚Äôt push without certain levels of brawlers for each trophy range.
---
Fair play indeed mr. Tea and crumpets
---
I played bull thrice in bounty, cause my screen had Leon, lol

did you just link the wrong vid?
---
that is the most dumbass logic i've heard in this sub. supercell is a mobile game and you're comparing that coding to a console game? where is your source on supercell having more complex coding or are you just talking out of your ass? releasing every month should be the expectation for supercell games. Minecraft has a much more developed endgame content that doesn't require constant updates which is why minecraft constantly releases patches
---
I thought that was gene skin
---
Cha cha bardzo ≈õmieszne
---
It looks like leon skin
---
When gene was launched the same arabian background appeared in news and twitter also the profile picture in twitter is just clear

They already said that they haven‚Äôt thought of anything regarding clubs. So we would have to wait at least 6 months for something like that.

So i just draw one of yours So its your turn.

hust draw what you want to draw

When you put it like that yeah it does make sense. I take it all back. It still feels disappointing after a better gift yesterday.

Yes they are.
---
No poco looks like hes 18
---
so funny.... is there a bs subreddit without 10yr old humor ?
---
brawl stars twitter or youtube banner
---
Should I? I am 13
---
why would we need 3 star power
---
Maybe darryl and penny got a remodel since they're both pirates and are on the remodel list
---
r/subsithoughtifellfor
---
This is reddit not youtube.
---
Oh also, if u unsub, make sure to sub to pewdiepie
---
Oh I get it, it must be a teaser for the new update
---
Ok but why do you have to put seaweed
---
No maybe emz likes poco but poco doesnt know that
---
You will
---
You do realise you can subscribe to subreddits?
---
I'd probably be just skins and gems/coins / brawl boxes, I don't think it will give too much of a competitive advantage..
---
yeah it's a sneak for the update
---
Theyre cousins
---
Stop
---
it like the song that goes ‚Äúfor the 1st day of christmas blah blah gave to me‚Äù and it goes up to 12 days
---
lmao
---
*crazy emz noises*
---
This is the only brawler were his old skin actually looks better
---
A lot of people have it tho because that‚Äôs when it started to take off
---
In the song the rewards gets better each day, so thats good :))
---
Yours too. At least I have standards and I don't eat up everything Supercell gives me.
---
barleychet
---
but it lowkey went down lmao
---
Ya but still players before 2020 will not get it and i am happy for it  :)
---
Oop
---
it was leaked in the Brawloween teaser
---
Maybe
---
A new brawler release, or have some skins be buy able with coins so they can be used for something.
---
It's the banner on all Brawl Stars social media accounts.
---
I agree, they should have built up to the mega box.
---
They do do it everyday... :D in the item shop

that's just ridiculous, I know

Opened it, and of course, didn't get shit. But had to try tho.
---
You guys are getting gifts?
---
Hatn't Poco
---
OMG I so did not know that
---
Gene seems correct, but little enlarged
---
At least I dont complain about free stuff.
---
And also on twitter. I expect it to be released on reddit too soon. Lets get ready for the trailer tmr!
---
r/shittybrawlstars
---
okej
---
Thats my cute gilr! Lets go Penny! &gt;:)
---
The amount of coins is how many braincells you miss from a normal brain
---
Yes
---
People who started in 2019 didn‚Äôt get it either. It was for people who started playing *before* 2019 that got it. My main account has it, but my second account doesn‚Äôf.
---
Take it or leave it lol imagine be dissapointed in getting free stuff
---
You downvoted my comment without replying. What's the matter?

A new spanish language bro

Why is this marked nsfw?

This gives me Detroit:Become Human memorie/vibes but I don't knoq why :V

Oh thanks now I understood !

High trophie people doesnt ussually get bots in their matchmaking +thes bots have 0 trophies each
---
Thanks üôèüôá
---
Lol "perfect pass" try "two randoms miss equally opportunistic shots #brawlball"
---
Idk I pressed some button and became nsfw
---
I find it hard, I believe the image goes back to the next environment, the tentacle would be around the map, like Dj frank no gem grab
---
Are you scared?
---
a new brawler being launched isn't a gift. and if skins costed coins it'd be like 10000 at least, so no thanks. I'll enjoy what they can give
---
üëâüëâ You are very welcomed
---
I care and I'm proud of you. Ignore the 9yo
---
Hey atleast they gave is something
---
me I have 30/30 but i have 500 gem so i dont rlly care.	
---
yes I payed
---
Oof I spelled update wrong
---
Absolutely not. Mega boxes will never be worth it.   
---
 
---
Compare that to the recent offer of 80 tickets for 59 gems. 80 * 32 tokens each is 2560. So for 59 gems you could get 2.56 mega boxes. Or buying two of those you could get 5 mega boxes for 118 gems. Two more mega boxes for 1 less gem.  
---
Gems should really only be used for ticket and token doubler offers, legendary brawlers or skins.
---
This is a bird

---
Whats this
---
Oh no you spent $50-$60 for probably well over 100 hours of content, which greatly exceeds that of most modern triple AAA games in terms of entertainment return on what you pay. This is one of the most generous free to play games out there. If they let you max out your account for $50 they would make no money. You really need to get over it and learn some patience.

a robot kraken? interesting...

I was up until midnight to see what the rewards would be lol

Those are actually usefull for F2P players, since most people at over 14k can already max every single brawler

This was found on the trailer for the world finals 2020

laugh in having 30/30 brawler

This is called shot delay, if you play on other servers this will happen.

Am I missing something here?  Mega box has the same chance of pulling a legendary as any normal box, correct?

This is really cool. Literally. Have my upvote.

Hola
---
all jokes aside, this sp might get a rework later down the line cause right now it promotes grouping up for the healing when in general you shouldn‚Äôt do that in 3v3 matches, it‚Äôs just not worth it
---
Brawl Talk tomorrow, but update 24 December i think...
---
interesting
---
It Could've Atleast been a thousand coins
---
Spike and Crow are op
---
LoL was a bad example, you're right. Smite i can drop $40 and get all champions and any that are released going forward. Pay for skins, emotes, voice packs etc if you so choose. I really just struggle getting on board with free to play games when they are modeled around pay to play. 
---
Fortnites, smites and the like offer 0 in game advantage from spending money but still offer plenty of avenues to compensate developers. 
---
More than anything for me though is measly rewards, i don't see it breaking their bank to have 100 coin rewards for every 150 trophies. 150 coins for 500 trophies just feels wrong lol.
---
Oh no their hot
---
Looking btw
---
Good
---
Really?
---
Each day till 24th so update is probably dropping on 24th?
---
Looks great
---
I think this is a very closed map, with a very closed meta
---
Rico, Dyna, and Barley would rush through teams and it wouldn't be competitive/fun enough to play
---
h
---
Spikes face is so smol
---
You should only be using spirit slap if u have it but no hate
---
Unlikely, too dark for the game I'd say. Remember when Executioner had a slightly threatning icon in Royale when it first came and was quickly changed so Supercell won't go for this too
---
Ywah the trower one is probably on purpose

But hear me out real quick
---
*Dumpling Darryl*
---
In all seriousness though, I know I probably could‚Äôve maxed my account a while ago had I not spent as much gems on skins as I did, but honestly, I want Brawl to be equal parts competitive and equal parts fun and overall just goofy, where skins come into play
---
I already play the game for an ungodly amount of hours a day, so I don‚Äôt really have to worry much about using my resources for more progressive things
---
you will eventually max it out but some skins are impossible to get if you don't get them when they are released I get only gold from my boxes and sometimes star powers ***I WANT A LEGENDARY BRAWLER***
---
What's the lowest level brawler you have? I've been hoarding my coins for lvl 8 brawler's and then just waiting on Star powers from boxes.
---
I have a completely maxed account in Brawl Stars with several hundred boxes saved up. I‚Äôve spent $100-$150 since beta.  Achieving something like that in most other f2p games for that price is downright unthinkable. $100 and a few years of playing would have you nowhere near maxed in Clash Royale for example. Now I know I had some advantages, like starting out in Beta which not everyone could do, but the fact that I‚Äôve achieved something that is otherwise downright impossible in most mobile games without spending thousands is pretty impressive in terms of arguing the fairness of Brawl Stars‚Äôs monetization model. It‚Äôs not perfect but I think the complaints are overblown. I also fully believe that they will rework the later stages of the trophy road to boost the rewards so I do think you will eventually get your wish anyway.

Golden crow and bo = white crow really are you serious

This kiddo ranked his mortis power 1 to rank 20 and complaining about strong players.
---
he is an assassin that is supposed to kill low health brawlers shotgunners counter him hard but he can kill them when they are low on health he is also very good in lone star (specially for kill stealing)
---
Imagine that instead of kairos predicting stuff is supercell copying it from this map
---
I love the Bibi one &lt;33
---
what if the kraken and ‚Äúswamp gene‚Äù ARE the same thing? like a new brawler!
---
I feel like everybody else doesn't know its this way, finally someone understands, I support this Idea 100%, but matchmaking can also be rigged this way. I hate matchups like this.

Can you guys STOP reposting this for free karma please?

Thanks for the kind words.  Not sure I'm deserving, but thank you. 
---
My favorite update was the one that introduced Pins, Badges, Medals, crests and star powers.  When Darryl was released.  Just really changed the game, gave lots of customization and I loved it. 
---
Crow is my favorite!
---
Should we ship this?
---
Well that‚Äôs just the cutest thing I‚Äôve seen all morning

We're definitely getting a new mortar. You can see it in the banner

Which starpower is the best for crow? The first rang 35 uses the second.

"Angry" with my viewers.  No.  I have a VERY slow fuse.  I do not get angry easily and when I do I'm quick to get over it. I've been dissapointed with viewers for things they have said, but I don't take things to heart.  Life is a tough thing and people lash out in strange ways sometimes.

Nice. What are your plans for future travel?

Hi Lex!
---
Love your contentüòç

My question is, can we play together, even if it is just for one match? I am an F2P player at 14k with no leggies and no max brawler. I know you are a pro and I wouldnt't be able to match your standards, but please can we just play one match?

And yeah, cereal always first. Who wouldn't do that? :P

This may have already been asked, but what state do you live in?   
---
Do you have a favorite movie series? That is it for now, since I shouldn't ask personal questions LOL. Love ya, Lex, keep it up!
---
I don't remember changing anything. And it disappeared on its own.
---
agree
---
Where did u find this
---
But we didn't lose. That's a draw
---
Tick reloading 15% (I think it was 15%) faster. Like,can't he just do that normally?
---
Yeah right
---
Approximately how much money did you spend in Brawl Stars?
---
Whats it like living with 7 children (if they havent left the house yet)? For me having 1 brother is already quite busy but i cant imagine 6 brothers/sisters
---
kinda reminds me of Imani from Paladins
---
Really? I thought they would've been underated
---
700 gems
---
Pam really fits

i'd like to think that she was lost in basket in the sea in when she was a baby and darryl found her and took care of her. he's like a robot dad to penny.

Day 10 : HUMAN WALK ON MARS
---
OR instead of banning players because of such actions,there can be a fix in Brawl Ball where when you or a teammate kicks or carrys the ball towards your goal,the ball (and you,if you carry it) would act as if you try to kick it/carry it towards an obstacle.

That's a Seat Le√≥n. Pretty common in spain.

yep they are permanent
---
It's Bright!  With the Devs leading the way and all the great additions that have been made, even if some need to be reworked like lonestar and take down in my opinion, things are looking good!    
---
I'd like to see it be a little easier for F2P players to progress, although it's not as bad as other Supercell games, some bigger additions like reasons to be in a Club, map making tool in game, ect but the future is bright!
---
Quite old info
---
yeah maybe..ü§î
---
Day 18: Crow gets unlimited health,ammo,damage and range
---
Do you think 99% of the community is all maxed? I think Supercell is going to further the trophy road but appeasing 1% of their playerbase isn't a big priority. I have 21 brawlers to upgrade and have no coins whatsoever. To be maxed I need like 30k coins. I have been playing for a long time, and have 19k trophies, and have bought many deals. But I'm still pretty far from being max.
---
Obviously going to be a new brawler after the last update üòí
---
Thx Man, I hope I can finish soon
---
who is that on the right?
---
Millions and millions of people actively play BS, but only thousands are maxed. That isnt a lot compared to millions.
---
Sorry i meant to type cursed
---
Hi lex I have been watching your videos since the brawl stars beta was launched, love your content and you're a very nice guy tbh very few people are like you in this world. Just wanted to say that you're the most awesome Brawl stars YouTuber (screw Kairos) XD just kidding Kairos is also good I guess but he ain't beating the likes of CanYaDigIt!!! Love you man, stay awesome!!

You can‚Äôt rank brawlers like this though, Mortis would easily be a top tier brawler in some brawl ball or gem grab maps. The style of play and game mode also effects how they‚Äôre ranked. I like the effort but it would have to be wayyy more complex to get an accurate tier list

The pirates stole Christmas?

Really cool ! I really want to see it when it's finalised
---
My point is that those who buy the pass royale get so many perks and the game is much more fun when you get some really cool tower skins,emotes and lightning for every chest.f2p's might get more than before but it's just not that exciting.
---
Nah, 3 mega boxes are worth 240 gems...
---
80 √ó 3 = 240
---
imagine to put shelly in S-tier
---
Sweet

It‚Äôs probably over, but I want to ask anyways. When did you and Kairos become good friends? Was it before or after you became YouTubers?
---
Don't call my girls thots. EMZ is one though
---
We got mega box and coins so far
---
Another post with the same think
---
no :[

Brawl Stars is so easy to grind trophy. Just use low trophy brawler. 30 brawlers to 500 trophies is 15000 trophy. While Clash is just 1 deck you can play at a time making it harder. Its not about fun or boring. It's about how the game system is created.
---
You could be making the right call. Once you get in the 300+ gems area you get from boxes you can buy legendary brawlers when the offers come.
---
I believe it is in order of preference
---
Art copilation for get karma
---
what dose neat mean ?
---
No it won't 
---
Without a 3D rendered model, its much more work to make skins
---
Nope not this time
---
Cute
---
With a yeti brawler that can roll snowballs that catch any enemy brawler that's hit and releases and slows them down when it reaches max range
---
Sad mobile noises
---
F12 is inspect

Tell me about it. Sandy came to my shop for 519 today... I have 224.
---
Cool
---
Who'd draw pirates and not include a kraken?
---
No, I'm the guy who dies right before this.
---
This might be true. I saw brawler ranking and a tier list. Many people probably think it's a meta tierlist. Jessie actually fit S-tier and so it felt even more like a meta list
---
Still very cool art tho!
---
It would be cool if they add emojis to communicate to your teamates while your playing =3

The original banner looks like a map banner

Do you think it's hard to become a technician? It's what I'm thinking about being.

Day 30 : Power Play for everybody
---
F
---
Counter-counterpoint, Power ‚Äú11‚Äù brawlers are more versatile and better equipped for different maps and gamemodes
---
hurB
---
It's not that low but most people should be able to push their brawlers to 500 trophies easily at power level 10
---
Day 31: Power Play has a Star Token!
---
You a slave to a page in my rhyme book
---
nop, 
---
Fr√≠o means Cold
---
But in Spanish "El Snowman" translates as "El mu√±eco de nieve"
---
Alot of people have said this but think about it
---
If they release a limited skin for a legendary brawler that most people dont have then theres gonna be alotta hate
---
B
---
Counter-counter-counterpoint, that doesn't matter on an individual map. Power 10 using the same star power as the power 11 would be the exact same
---
brawlidad xd
---
Oh this is not cool! But Frio is cool! I will post it this will  name
---
I would love a smaller kraken like brawler
