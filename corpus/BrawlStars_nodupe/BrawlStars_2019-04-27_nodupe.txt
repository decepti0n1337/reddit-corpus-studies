Please do something about Rosa 1. My boi spike will not die from this ‚Äúplantiest brawler‚Äù 2.  Rosa‚Äôs super is very not overpowered whatsoever 3. About her super again, all other supers can‚Äôt do much when Rosa has he super activated.
---
insta kills with its zero damage. oof, that super did so much damage to piper that it glitched the game and made it zero damage. In the meanwhile, piper two shots shelly and laughs at shelly's low range.

I think you are getting that sentence wrong: Getting all the brawlers of the same rarity, doesn't increase your legendary chance exactly. It isn't like "oh, I got all epics, now my legendary chance is 0.01% bigger!"
---
It is more simple. Let me explain you with an example, the numbers are not real: Epics have a 5% drop rate, legendaries got 1%. Your chance of not getting a legendarie is 94% (100-5-1=94).
---
If you get all the epics, now obviously you can't get them anymore, so your chance of not getting a legendary is 99% (100-1=99).
---
Basically, what you do is decreasing your CHANCE OF NOT GETTING LEGENDARIES, but the legendario chance will be the same.
---
So, IN MY OPINION, don't buy Piper. Keep the gems and use it for tickets or token doublers
---
Bruh she came out today and brawl ball isn‚Äôt even out wtf are you talking about
---
I think the better change would be to being unable to charge her super while she is using it
---
Too OP also too cheap in the store. Diluted the game in my opinion.
---
Her super is way too strong, she gotta get a nerf
---

Rosa defeated?
---
Wait.That's illegal.
---
This is OUR lost trophies
---
√ü
---
Imo super shouldn‚Äôt be able to charge while using it. I think while Rosa is using her super, the full bar of the super will deplete, going backwards, until her super is actually done. Only then will she be able to charge it again
---
a concept I had for a brawler with a big sword was the following.
---
Main: Swung a sword back and forth in a semi-circle radius
---
Super: Does a little hop(which fits the frog very well lol) and slams down allowing him to knockback players
---
ü§°
---
Everybody gangsta til you lose a game
---
What? You are right, in that each chest has a 10% chance. But the more chests you open, you absolutely will get her eventually. In your example of a 10% shelly, If you open ten chests, the chance of getting her is about 35%. If you open 100 chests, the chance of getting her is 99.9999%. 
---
By saving chests, you give yourself more opportunities to have a 10% chance of pulling her, and additionally when you do, you have lots of chests to start trying to get power points for that character.
---
This is great XD
---
Rosa against Rosa will be one of the most unexpected matches
---

Not to mention her power level compared to the others...yet shes star player

Agreed

That look in her eye.

I could certainly try and do a female voice, but the results aren‚Äôt gonna be professional

And no super stacking
---
idk how I messed that up, I'm an OSU fan also
---
I was just about to say that
---
Then they'll say Barely needs a buff
---
That would be better, but I been seeing players complain about how she is too much of a tank!
---
It takes no skill whatsoever to use Rosa
---
Brock Obama has my vote
---
SpongeBOSS Square Pants!
---
Damn, this episode of Law &amp; Order is getting really good
---
Reminds me of an epic skeleton
---
Shelly is still probably going to be the best counter to Rosa in brawl ball, but even then, she'll be effective.
---
The super is still going to force Rosa to drop the ball. If Shelly is max, the slow effect will help Shelly be able to get the ball and kick it away
---
SC either is incompetent and don't test their game or they're releasing broken brawlers/cards on purpose so people spend money/gems. It's ridiculous, it's the same for Clash Royale as well, so I'm leaning towards SC doing it on purpose.

Same for me, pulled frank and in the last of my 30 chests i got 5 gems, so i had exactly 19 gems to buy her.

Just a super nerf to 50%
---
Tuppa
---
Pretty nice voice action! This voice looks like Rockstar Foxy from Ultimate Custom Night
---
That‚Äôs how the showdown works
---
He is an assassin and generally assasin character deals high damage with low hp
---
I like it a lot, I just feel like the brawlers who down closer to the center have an advantage
---
Make it so when she is using her super she cant charge it up
---
r/wooooshwithfouros
---
Buff her super so it negates 95% of damage, but only for 5 seconds, buff her range a bit, nerf her spread, but decrease her base hp to something lower like 3400 or 3600 and nerf her damage to 400, also nerf her reload speed a bit, this way she will be more of a skirmisher like Tara who uses her super to get close but lacks much strength without it.
---
This will make her a very strong brawler because she‚Äôll be able to use her super and become just as invincible as she is now, but she‚Äôll be much weaker without it and more susceptible to stuns and knocbacks since her super duration is shorter, if she is able to charge her super she will be able to win every fight but it‚Äôl be harder to chain it with only 5 seconds.
---
Because she‚Äôll have less health her star power won‚Äôt be as useful, but because 300 health a second is really strong already it won‚Äôt really need any changes. Personally I would like to see super chaining removed comepletely because it makes it very difficult to balance some brawlers like Rico, Tara, and the new Rosa because their supers can be easily chained once they have been obtained once.
---
If frank can do it unguarded, Rosa can do it with an 80% damage reduction shield
---
Middle is forever covered in barley‚Äôs wrath

---
I already posted a petition
---
Bo
---
Same here for myself and the hubby
---
Thats what I meant
---
All I can play is showdown.
---
they would have to nerf every other brawler that can super chain tho so it wont happen it will probably get nerfed from 80%-70% damage reduction
---
Isn't this exploitable or smth?
---
r/cursedbrawlstars
---
The only difference is that Rosas do so little damage to each other because of damage reduction, not because of very low damage in the first place like ice wiz.
---
ROSA HAS ENTERED THE CHAT
---
Yeah , maybe
---
&gt;I dont know who you are... but i will find you... and i WILL TRY MY BEST TO GET YOU HIRED IN SUPERCELL!!!
---
Wow, thank you for saying good things. If that happens, I would be so happy. :D
---
Indian?
---
Me, too. I can't wait for this skin to come out.
---
That leon was trash lmfao
---
The ice wiz slow does decrease dps as well
---
*NO WAY*
---
Are those Japan flags?
---
He had ~500 trophies ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
When you realise you haven‚Äôt gotten anything since July 2018
---
Unlike Jessie, Rosa will walk into 5 brawlers and take 4000 damage and kill every one of them. Good luck getting through that shield
---
I mean playing leon kinda carries you to 500 lmao
---
Nice
---
i got 5 brawlers withing a week but i wouldve preffered one or two legendaries cause that dropped my chances from .2% t .06%, but u will make it, just hang in dere :P
---
I still prefer el Primo tbh
---
woah it's like clash royale :/
---
1. Use a brawler with knockback to knock the ball away from her
---
2. Dont target her if thats the case, target the  supports. And they cant do that if rosa doesnt have her super so keep your distance
---
3. Dont let her get close enough to you to let her kill you, keep your distance
---
4. Use a piper in this map so you can target her from a distance and keep your distance, and use yoyr super to get away from energy drinked rosa
---
5. If you use a ranged brawler you can hit her without her hitting you so shes easy to kill from a distance
---
6. Ise control brawlers in heist, like you are supposed to do and keep your distance from her
---
7. Rosa verse rosa is very auto aimy but all other close ranged brawlers are too so...
---
8. Dont engage a rosa with close ranged brawlers keep your distance from her and attack their teammates
---
9. Same with many other brawlers
---
Has my point become clear yet?
---
Just a question for some people? Is it a bannable offense because they get the gems then have their credit card/debit card cancel the purchase so they technically get free gems
---
completely agree. this dude needs more upvotes!
---
wow meems.
---
Super cats are a copy too
---
It‚Äôs honestly how supers should work
---
Play by play he did nothing wrong. He juked right before he supered so it looked like he was going the other way.
---
First shot into the bush in in, he didnt see me leaving. Second shot i juked half of it but it didnt miss, their was a hit, and that was all.
---
So what play makes you think hes trash?
---
holy shit you're so lucky!!!! you got 13 coins!!
---
Why picture of Gold medalist Ricochet?
---
Why are there two powercube books shouldn‚Äôt one be different?
---
Oh trust me ima use use whether u care or notü§£ and you are a bum lmfao foh
---
She was in shop
---
BUZERANT!!!
---
Android
---
He missed an entire attack and then missed two other times, I'd he had hit just 1 more you would have died but he played like trash with movement
---
Awesome map! I would name it Loophole. Sounds cool

I like it!

Angry birds evolution too has this system
---
Good point. With Gene being a mythic brawler some people won't have him. So Shelly and Frank are very good alternatives to Rosa. Spikes super is also very good at slowing Rosa down. Barley main attack and super plus Bo's supers can make  Rosa change her route if need be to avoid the stun from Bo's mines. Or risking her. super to run out while she's in the fire. In fact technically any super that causes damage in an area can easily be a problem for Rosa because with hersuoer being six seconds long. Timing it just right. She could run out of the super in the middle of any area damaging supers
---
For Example, Brock, Dynamike, Barley, Tara, Bo, Spikes. Hell even Piper's super can all be a problem for Rosa If you time them well enough to hit her when her super is about to wear out.
---
Nitas Bear can also be a nuisance for Rosa. With the fact that if Rosa tries to auto aim a brawlershe will most likely hit the bear instead giving her zero charge. And if your a Daryll and  she's after you. You can easily just super away from her.
---
Huh...so 10 (Rosa can counter Rosa pretty good, I'll be it very tediously) of the 25 brawler in the game have a way to delay Rosa from using her super to the fullest potential
---
Wait a sec i had 33 boxes as well and got piper and rosa, piper being last
---
You're honestly stupid if you think he didnt do anything wrong lmao. He should have won that if he was smarter.

He‚Äôs probably a God &amp; let everyone punch him without hurting anyone.

cant tell with all that lag..
---
On paper, her powers are dumb, and her appearance is crap, but in actuality she is OP. Please nerf and redesign.
---
üòÇ Actually she forgot her notebook but her crush found out and ran to her to give her the notebook .üòãThis kind of situation once happened in my childhood and I‚Äôm unbelievably nervous when I heard my crush calling me behind,like ..u know,when u hear ur crush‚Äôs voice ,u will feel like ur heart is melting üò®

Lol this idea is perfect,I like that üòÇü•¥‚ù§Ô∏è
---
That‚Äôs great !!! :)
---
Lol
---
she is really quite broken in terms of her super and when she is the big brawler it is really hard to kill her, for example my 1000 dmg attack from nita only deals 200 and its really impossible to focus her down and get close to her
---
Rosa is not a new challenger, she is a butcher on steroids, welcome to the new meta...
---
I feel like supercell purposefully made rosa an op brawler in order to compensate for what happened with carl - extremely underwhelming upon release. With a recent carl buff and also release of rosa, the people will use the new brawlers more often and mix up the meta a lil bit. It used to be just a cycle of pam, jessie, colt, spike, leon and brock. With that being said, she‚Äôs obviously getting a nerf soon. 80% of damage reduction is way too much and supercell clearly knows it as well. Push your rosa asap before that happens.
---
Supersell,please nerf Rosa
---
1)Nerf duration of shield
---
2)Nerf shied damage absorption
---
3)Nerf hitpoints
---
4)Nerf passive ability
---
5)Nerf range of attack
---
Please,Supersell,hear my cry!

They could just switch high reward trophies for gems instead of coins, and if it is a fraction of the player base they won‚Äôt lose that much money

It's from an animation Supercell made. You can find it in their Twitter page, it's named something like "Welcome Rosa"

You know when you put in all your tickets to play big game and all the bosses are Jessie‚Äôs and rosas except for a few you, tend to get pissed off.
---
If you can't beat them, join them.
---
Woah, poor spike
---
Why is this nsfw
---
Star power
---
She may be dog shit without the super but you gotta remember she does have the super and its super easy for her to get the super
---
i think they should fix her in some modes so she isnt stupid op. heres my suggestions:
---
1. brawl ball: make rosa unable to pick up the ball while using her super, similar to carl
---
2. siege: make the IKE do more damage to her shield to prevent rushes from rosas
---
3. the other modes you cant do anything to so just either nerf the duration of her super or nerf the damage blocked
---
Honestly it's such lazy design imo, a super that is just passive
---
Wow look at this high elo guy
---
Well jessie is easy to defeat tho
---
Well that works but Jessie and Pam are confirmed part of the 'Junker family' together with Scrappy
---
End score: 195 - 194
---
Maybe play as someone other than primo or mortis? She‚Äôs easy pickings with almost any other brawler
---
skull creek 2.0 lol
---
Op as fucc
---
Wow so nice
---
I can readjust the amount of boxes. I'm probably going to make another version with your guys suggestions.
---
So Penny's cannon official name is Lenny?
---
The mirror we saw in Harry Potter.
---
rosa should deal x2 damage to spike lmao
---
Noooo thats an actually very sad thing
---
F for Primo please!!!
---
Such a trash Account
---
He already has this and it is a p-r-i-v-a-t-e server.
---
Exactly! I get no action. As soon as I step in, Rosa murders me. The only way to stay alive is to bush camp!
---
I aprove this drawing.

I was literally looking to see if anyone said this so I could say itüòÇ

This is a repost

Mista is shaking in his boots rn

They release OP characters so they can make more money off gems. This is not okay

---
Lol I wish I could copy down what I see like you...
---
I get it, since her release it has been hard to push a my level 4 Tara since Rosa players will just walk towards you and abuse your lack of damage, I am getting pretty high with her so I face a lot of higher level brawlers who can destroy me really easy, it‚Äôs hard.
---
C-can we be friends?
---
#nerfrosa
---
Barley and...EVERY BRAWLER SHE IS OPPPP
---
He's good as the big brawler, you could literally just run around and take very little damage.
---
Hahaha Big Game is so fucked rn
---
Mortis: I'm gonna spoil you the end of the movie
---
Rosa in Gem Grab: Don't mind me, I'm just going to take the gems and I will be on my way very soon
---
Totally overpowered with her ult in both gem grab and brawl ball. 80% is just too much she can literally ignore all the damage and just walk away with the gems. 
---
And i once thought those carts in Minecart Madness could be the most annoying things in this game. I was too naive.
---
Nice skin!
---
That‚Äôs zillakami
---
I don't think it works like that, i had penny on 400 trophies and i could only see the replays where im playing her when she's at 400
---
Upvote! Because you are a bongo cat fan!
---
Sham? Lmao
---
I thought I was going insane this morning when I went through *THREE* showdowns in a row where nearly half of the teams were composed of only Rosas. I was lucky enough to unlock her shortly after cuz I had no intentions of spending gems, so I guess I'm obligated to check her out now. 
---
In other words, avoid showdown today, cuz Rosa's still gonna be crowding it.
---
She‚Äôs op, it won‚Äôt be hard
---
She is ruining the game for me no lie.
---
that's... sad
---
:)
---
5?
---
Only way to level her up right now! Not gonna wait 20 mins to get matched in another game mode.
---
This is by far my most favorite historical moment &amp; most loved story/book i've ever read!

Take it to the police

I think you should do what happens next! I‚Äôm excited üòÜ
---
Rascal Primo Vs Rascal Shelly is basically familly killing each other
---
How is your counting so good? xD
---
random one has full cost.  specific brawler offers are on discount.
---
Sigh,okay.i guess it's a lost cause

We need to name the duck pippy, asap

Same hereüòì

its okay. i didnt want to sleep tonight anyway

What‚Äôre the images from?

Supercell is really buying out

Still less of a nightmare than Rosa with the super
---
Yeah, Klazui was a truly shit person, and wasn‚Äôt understanding at all. $&amp;@% him lol
---
I have the same problem
---
Except I‚Äôm only missing epics
---
She aint even op only at low trophies

Your skins are so good, I'm wondering if SC actually added any of them to the game?

A normal rosa is OP as fuk, imagine having to deal with a Rosa with star power (heals in bushes) on that one map where everything is just bushes!
---
If you're scaling up the health then you don't need to scale down the attack damage.
---
And 7500 you can do by getting every brawler to 300 which doesn't say anything
---
Noce reference to rescal primo!!! Nice work!! Like always!!!
---
Bro so did I I hate Suoercell though because I still don‚Äôt have pam
---
Haha
---
Or nerf it to 60% damage reduction in general, or less
---
Actually really nice, but one more picture where the cactus opens his eyes and sweats cause its a hidden spike would perfect.
---
I like the concept of this one linking from the other drawing :D excellent work
---
Image? Are you talking about template?
---
Healing aka POCO
---
imo jessie is more annoying than rosa. at least rosa cant destroy the entire team at once with the stupid high-damage bouncing shot and the t u r r e t
---

---
She mustn't obtain a gun!
---
genius üòÇ
---
What‚Äôs your channel called?
---
I'd say not to reduce her damage but make her much slower, like a plant. This makes it much harder to chain supers as people run circles around you, and you are pretty much a bigger spike super(almost makes sense with the plant theme)
---
Have you heard boss penny *you dont recover from that*
---
Lol just reminds me of it
---
She is impossible to stop in Brawl Ball. She literally will tank her way to the goal.
---
And penny
---
*Actually, Darryl does not care*
---
You ain't getting those ever, that's the law üòÇü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I have 9 upgrades pending... Ughhh!
---
Rosa but she plays uno and wraps herself with pink toilet paper
---
What's dramatic? Matchmaking is nuts. Its easier than primo to play- which I never thought I would say. She looks like shelly meets spike, no no originality. And she only brings a boring tanky invincibility factor to game. Everyone in my club agrees. Game is sort of boring last 2 days
---
I havent even noticed these details great job
---
yes
---
The Darryls. Yes, the Darryls
---
Robo rumble
---
In Big Game, if your fighting against her it's impossible to win. But if it's Rosa v 5 Rosas, you know it's gonna be 999999999 years.
---
Just look at the trophies
---
Robo Rumble play with Pam Bull and Colt for the best possible time.
---
Don't play with randoms.
---
Hope this helps.
---
Rip Bo
---
I‚Äôve seen this post before
---
I think what they can do to nerf rosa is actually make her charge her ult slower and a heads up a hard counter to rosa is frank in every situation frank wins the 1v1 unless he‚Äôs in a corner
---
Those are rookie numbers, I have 17 brawlers with upgrades available, 4 out of the remaining 5 are lvl 9+.
---
And at least 2 upgrades on each brawler coz they're all lvl 7 or below.
---
WTF darryl star power is 40% she would be useless
---
LOOK AT U LOOK AT U
---
MmMmMm NoT sToLeN aT aLl
---
and then you realise you didn't get rosa
---
Oops, I forgot her... She is ok...(2000 damage at half the Max range isn't less)
---
N rosa is best brawler
---
Just came in here to say I'm not playing the game until rosa is balanced.  Her movement speed and super charge rate means she can stick to any brawler way too easily, take almost no damage, and have her ultimate up indefinitely.  I suggest reducing her ultimate charge rate and duration so she gets a definitive advantage when closing the gap but doesn't auto-win by pressing super and auto aim.
---
All damage she blocks should be distributed onto all her allies evenly
---
Rosa is broken in snake prairie and she is broken in general and yet I still don't have her.
---
At least she is legal.
---
I Barley noticed myself....
---
I guess this is a very good game
---
If you get the purchasable brawler from a box, the purchasable brawler will switch to one you don't have.
---
I see where you are coming from. I agree that everyone should have a voice, if it's not just weird mumbling. I don't have any idea of what tara's and gene's voices could sound like without being mumbling
---
Rosa should have 90% less damage in her ult then she‚Äôd be viable
---
If I would be Supercell I would make Rosa's super charge in 6 ammo and i would nerf her health after all she is a RARE.
---
Even better, she gets 100% damage resistance for 6-8 seconds, but at the end of the duration, all the damage she blocked is returned to her instantly.
---
Came here to say this, that would work
---
Rosa kinda *HOT*
---
Jaaaaaaaaa
---
Just F
---
Underated post amazing work^^

---
Awesome art! What do you use?
---
I know why supercell hasn‚Äôt added if your godly skins... they‚Äôre too good for the gameü§£ü§£ü§£
---
AMAZING
---
At half the max range, her damage is about 1566(power 10). Also Piper is a really good brawler but very map specific due to the presence of various map elements. I mean where really do you see her other than bounty, a couple of gem grab maps and some showdown maps?
---
Woooow thes is perfect
---
made with el primo üòÇ
---
And what does OmO says?
---
Tara‚Äôs voice is much worse imo
---
Add 80% dmg reduction for full duration
---
Bull + Pam + Rosa might be even better.
---
Solo SD is unplayable if I don't use Rosa. Rosa and power drinks are too op
---
Yes, i have start today two hours ago, im not good using sony vegas :/

Yeah i wont blame you for low ranks sonce its all rosa. But in higher ranks please dont
---
Rosa is unbelievably overpowered in the soccer mode. She can just tank right through your defenses, no way to stop her. I‚Äôve lost every soccer game I‚Äôve played today to a team with a rosa.
---
You‚Äôre right... x10 is not enough.
---
Jea this is unfair
---
Second Most epic footage of Dyna-Jump
---
&gt; you can be brain dead and still be good with her. 
---
Hey! I resemble that remark!
---
That makes more sense then. If you wanted to be big brawler so bad, you should've bet 1 ticket at a time for much better odds.
---
In gem grab you have to go to the middle or go get the gems when ur team mate carrying the gem dies. In brawl ball you'll have to get close since it's not about killing the other team, the space is super tight in siege. In heist there's people wont just watch you shoot from far away and in bounty  not all the maps favor piper.
---
Actually I was sorting by New like 10 minutes ago and I found one.
---
Which is why I don't charge without my super or being close to it. Also I possess the ancient skill known as dodging. To my knowledge only Bulls and El Primos do not know this technique. Even Franks know it, but they generally aren't masters of it.

Yeah. Have you played Clash Royale? Are you not familiar with the new cards braking the game nearly every single release? It was almost like a clock; Release OP card, Nerf it. Release stupidly underpowered card, buff it. Repeat, repeat, repeat. The next brawler we get will be an underpowered one.
---

Thanks, I'm kinda new .

Only because you don't have her doesn't mean others must not enjoy a brawler that finally feels strong.
---
You need Poco for the burst heals, Pam by herself can‚Äôt make up for 3 brawlers + IKE all blasting Rosa.
---
No, it's just if anyone that was in the lobby was using their brawler above 400 then anyone can see the replay

And selling it for 19 gems of course helps.

thing is this makes darryll's star power obsolete. (after he uses his super he gets 40% damage reduction)
---
After that, will you do CooC or RooR?
---
Except I‚Äôm only missing shelly
---
I'm betting it could be any mode given how ridiculously op she is. But brawl ball is the peak of it, literally use super and cross the map to the goal.
---
nice!
---
I had that problem until recently.  I spent $5 to buy gene but didn‚Äôt get a single mythic for months after that until last week. Now I just need Tara.
---
It's great

Wtf they were thinking when they released her, seriously.

It‚Äôs a game for kids...
---
speak to me

&amp;#x200B;

In big game, but in 3v3 the enemy always has Rosa too so it¬¥s not unfair

Then there‚Äôs CoC where nothing has really ever been OP.

---
Her shield makes her nearly invincible
---
 Guaranteed 3mins minimum.
---
Bull Heatlh, Spike because plants, Shelly because.. meh, Darryl because Super, El Primo because PUNCHS
---
I refuse to play BB now. Haven‚Äôt played it for a token yet.
---
I'm.. confused?
---
Actually, I think they won‚Äôt ever kill each other since her attack animation is quite long and she doesn‚Äôt reload while doing the attack animation, thus less effective DPS. But as someone else said, you might get a punch in between supers. But let‚Äôs calculate like you did, this is amusing.
---
Shut up randy, it took them a month to fucking nerf Leon. Fucking freak, pipe down
---
Doesn't rosa deal more damage the further away she is from her target?
---
ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Oh. üòÇ I am sorry, I'm oblivious sometimes.
---
wtf
---
She would only be an offensive beast if she could get in range.
---
The fastest way to get in range would be to not use your super on the way there.
---
Not using your super means you would be open to being killed on the way there
---
Using your super means it takes too long to get there and you run out and are killed once you're in range without enough super time left to build up super again
---
This heavily dampens her offensive range and effectiveness, while keeping her just as strong defensively since she doesn't need to move as much when the offense is coming to her
---
This also raises her skill cap because the move-speed decrease while using super raises the importance of positioning in the game for her, hopefully making it around as important as it is for everyone else.
---
**ON THE OTHER HAND**
---
Nerfing her damage makes fights take longer and the game *even slower* and people are already complaining about how slow the game is in posts and comments on the subreddit. This will technically nerf rosa but at the expense of entertainment value.
---
You have to keep your distance. Good strategy, right?
---
Thanks for your explanation  :)

---
She's really ridiculous. I used my power 9 Shelly, had an energy drink and shot in total, 2 supers and 4 normal shots from basically right next to the Rosa and only got her down to like 3000 because she was obviously using her super. Then I was playing Brawl Ball, the other team had a Rosa. At one point in the game it was all 3 of us (Frank, Jessie and Shelly) and only the Rosa on our side. Didn't matter that all 3 of us hit her with every attack possible but nope, just runs past and into the goal while still at like 2000 health. Like okay Super Cell

Supercell: .\_.
---
Clash royale was the same thing lol that‚Äôs where this comes from. Supercell would release really op cards, wait until a ton of people bought them, and then nerf them right after. The only opposite I remember was when Supercell buffed elite barbarians to a point where they were op as hell, and then after a few updates later they decided to nerf them.
---
I just did that today with spike
---
When you say nerf crow out loud it sounds so weird and different with all the buff crows we've been hearing
---
Witch doctor crow would be an epic drawing if you can draw it
---
And rascal primo/bull
---
Buff Leon
---
They are all called Bob
---
Behind the Safe
---
Xd
---
meanwhile i have crow and no mythics
---
How about reducing her shield from 80% to 60%  but
---
when rosa use her super it will move faster by 16% (from 2.5 tiles per second to 2.9 tiles per second) It will be a little bit similar to crow speed (3.1 tiles per second) and now it will be more easy to kill rosa with her super and also it will make Rosa more able to escape or to reach her enemies easily with her super
---
That's a good idea!
---
Find ‚Äúshelly‚Äù
---
Honestly, I‚Äôll give it to Supercell for making the modifiers more anti-team. However, the meteors are way too slow and will almost always get dodged. They need to make spawn faster on teamers
---
Oh. It‚Äôs a piper; but idk where shelly is
---
Yes I am. I still don't have Rosa. And f\*\*k me I spent all my gems goddamnit
---
I think you forgot a zero

Lol did u say you were the best player? Lmfao!!!

Wait how you know?
---
They should give Piper a school girl skin where instead of a parasel she has a pencil that shoots erasers and her super drops heavy folders that explode into papers
---
Go GOATS next time you thrower...
---
It was definitely a premised room
---
With longer range and a good starpower and super. Would it be more original to let her throw knifes? No. No it wouldn‚Äôt.

No I just jumped in with randoms

---
Yeah that‚Äôs pretty accurate.
---
But Lissa has a longer range, a op starpower and a decent super.
---
It wouldn‚Äôt be better if she‚Äôd throw knifes.
---
imagine next year april fool they replace nita model with that
---
Oh okey, and yes thats shelly, but pretty old
---
I'm still gonna downvote this; no one's even laughing
---
Been playing since global (every day), have all epics and everything lower, no mythics or legendarys. My friends all have mythics and legendarys tho, and they‚Äôre all like 1000, 2000 trophies behind me. Also when I played clash Royale, I only got princess.
---
I feel you man, best of luck.
---
(Also f2p)
---
mash the freaking bear
---
I‚Äôm getting her to 500 in fear that she‚Äôll be nerfed to smithereens come Monday morning.

Change damage reduction to 60%, gains ult charge at half speed while using it.
---
Maybe it's one of those stains on the ground
---
Stfu we get it ur clogging up the subreddit with shit!

I don‚Äôt know what you talking about

In Italy they never show Videogame ads in Movie theatres, only wine and bakery ads...

I played since before global on that as well, that wasn‚Äôt always the case. Yeah a few were like that, like e-barbs. But most of them weren‚Äôt.

Are you ironic?
