Bo and Bo: WE CAN SEE YOU
---
---
---
Well did you do anything in the past? I'm going to venture that Supercell went back and reviewed your entire account history and found some other questionable charge backs. 
---
True but why would anyone do it?
---
No that was the only one they even gave me the exact time that specific charge back happened
---
WHAAT?!? Congrats. 
---
Was worth a shot
---
I have screenshots of it and stuff like that. Screenshots of the map

Username checks out
---
When i created it
---
Looks amazing good job
---
So they can add their own watermark and steal all the credit 
---
Go check my remake
---
Nah i have screenshots abd i have been talking to stefanos i think hes a dev or somethig
---
True, I didn’t consider that!
---
🤣 why credit to the other guy?
---
It still is a good map design though.
---
Come on grab your friend~
---
NerVE ThIS
---
Where can I get a flair? 
---
ELLLLLLL PRIMOOOOOO
---
Thanks
---
Why do I not have this update
---
L O N G P U N C H
---
Idk i actually like the skin but it could be a lot better
---
Is frank a girl???
---
Stoop xc *dead*

I just got leon and spike from a regular box.
---
Wait sale and save 90 gems
---
30*
---
post it to pew sub before someone repost it
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
They are very good but a little bit to over the top in my opinion.
---
I spent like 40$ and already have leon and spike(from regular boxes lol), none mythic tho. 
---
Totally Agree!
---
Well it’s not in the brawl ball goal but it’s close
---
Cool
---
Increases speed and damage but not health
---
Why almost every map from reddit is bulltopia? 
---
Man do I get so irritated when I see people with 1-2k trophies or even less than 1k trophies have one, two or even all three legendaries... Supercell, make things more fair for your veteran players who have played since day one of the beta launch... Like me and many others.
---
I use one brawler that I never rank up above rank 14 so I can just solely use him for grinding keys and star keys and it's spike
---
Agree completely
---
Getting less brawler pieces. Then you have a higher chance of getting that new brawlers because getting no more colts or spikes from a chest can mean you get stuff that isn’t those brawlers. Thus increasing the other stuff for new brawlers. So if you have 14 brawlers max, you have a really high chance to get a new brawler.
---
Ah but the hardest task is not yet complete. Good luck retrieving the 2 trophies 
---
The locations of boxes randomly change a bit everygame
---
What makes that idea yours and not his exactly?? 
---
Stop stealing and reposting...
---
Darryl is my second favorite brawler, he deserves a darryl map.
---
Very Nice
---
Woah, that’s awesome! You sir have earned an upvote for teaching me something new.
---
Happy brawling! I imagine you are one of the talented Crows that will surely kill me on the battlefield [haha].
---
Leon better watch out lol XD
---
Yeah fr... at 2k with 20 brawlers 
---
First, there aren't "chests" in the game
---
Frank gas been inspired by Mortis' bravery it seems 
---
They first took off his hat 
---
Then they killed him in brawl ball 
---
Now they're giving him the worst skin ever 
---
Thx SuPecELl
---
i have 20 small and 1 big, trying to save up for a mythic/ legend, how many boxes will it take?
---
me too, his foot is his...
---
No, u
---
Holy Crow, they "buffed" crow!
---
When you realise this was made by a SC employee
---
Vs
---
When you still hate on mortis skin
---
judging by the number of down votes you don't know what you're talking about either
---
You're expelling too many confused emotions 
---
someone can still come to you with the launch pads. and with how small the map is, it probably will happen. you take a bit of damage, everyone will be launching towards you. Honestly, I'd be surprised if a lot of games come down to the poison closing all the way in for this map
---
Yes  he is a backline but  lets talk about modes....  crow was already a good brawler in showdown and not so good in all other modes..  and nothing change.... he still not good in heist( need dmg to be good on this mode) brawl ball( needs high HP or high dmg and some control.. he has control but doenst have any HP and low dmg) Siege( again dmg) gem grab(control  he has some control but others  brawler have better control with better HP or better dmg) bounty( he has no range or dmg to go agais brock or piper and if darryl roll into you or mortis dash you are dead) so this buff didn't make him better in the other modes that he is not good
---
he has 11000 trophies how to suck there?
---
Aw, so cute! 
---
Okay so you made a comment about it? Big deal lol that doesn't mean shit. 
---
Here's some advice , if you have an idea.. keep it to yourself until you actually do it and finish it lolol. It's not like it was a damn patented idea dude... get over it
---
Removed - DO NOT SUBMIT POSTS WITH TITLES IN ALL CAPS. CAPS LOCK IS CRUISE CONTROL FOR COOL

Nőt bad
---
Because the guy said he did, plus trophies don’t always mean skill
---
This was so cringy I laughed
---
It radiates soo much toxicity
---
Everyone should have a top hat skin
---
[removed]
---
Reminds me of undertale steam puzzle
---
Oh yeah I forgot about about those launch pads! I seriously hope they incorporate them into showdown.
---
OMG YEEEEES THIS IS GOOD 
---
So you're saying you wouldn't mind if I stole an idea of yours before you get the chance to make it and make it and give no credit to you and get like a billion upvotes you wouldn't mind. Ok thx I'll keep a watch now this is gonna be good...
---
Wtf
---
You're absolutely right, everyone is really greedy and expects every supercell update to be perfect. In my opinion, this was an amazing update, it was just a minor (potential mortis skin idea for cr) error. Did they expect supercell to make the update spotless? It was a great update and no one is appreciating the amazing additions in the update.
---
Thicc frank
---
Man, just go to support in the game and send the images, he should get banned, Reddit is not for this, pls make sure that 6 years old kid gets BULLIBANNED
---
That looks great! 
---
What's your concept? 
---
Awesome! I love the idea that once you go to mid, there’s no turning back. That would make for some really fun gameplay!
---
Give me some reason why they should do that?
---
Yeah, the crow buff and darryl nerf were a bit lacking.
---
He makes very good designs and well known for it (also riochann and sector03, who makes good concepts)
---
So let talk about game modes.....I mean crow was already a good brawler in showdown and not so good in all other modes..  and nothing change.... he still not good in heist( need dmg to be good on this mode) brawl ball( needs high HP or high dmg and some control.. he has control but doenst have any HP and low dmg) Siege( again dmg) gem grab(control  he has some control but others  brawler have better control with better HP or better dmg) bounty( he has no range or dmg to go agais brock or piper and if darryl roll into you or mortis dash you are dead)  so this buff did nothing to he became more viable in other modes......

---
Great idea my dude! 
---
I like this cuz octopi can camouflage 
---
What if the turret was a German Shepard, lol. Love the design though.
---
cool
---
He looks broken AF
---
Colt isn’t only about hitting shots. He’s all about movement. Watch your replays and learn sidestepping and player movements. Best colt skin btw. 
---
practically took months to include, apparently
---
Honestly, it’s hard to tell. Showdown relies heavily on circumstances. For instance, the Darryl kinda bailed you out a bit when you went up against that second Brock while you were weakened. Could you have taken him out? Maybe. But my point is it’s hard to measure skill by showdown.
---
If you post some Gem Grab/Biunty/Heist clips, I’d be able to give you a better review.
---
To answer your question, the fact that you manual aim puts you above the average Colt at your trophy range. Like I said before, it’s hard to determine positioning and other nuances from showdown.
---
i know what happened, you bought gems but then refunded after you spend the gems so they removed your gems. this happened to my friend on clash of clans
---
Nothing can get any edgier than introducing you edgy friend to your even edgier legendary friends
---
I know I'm just memeing, the skin is actually fun
---
Is mortis gay? 
---
Los primos are here.
---
It was for the sanity of the MortisGang
---
I would expect in about 2 or 3 weeks, they will probably do a countdown like they did for Gene
---
Above average? yay! Ok, I will send you/post some 3v3 clips. I am still learning him and practicing.
---
Looks like spike sat on their phone...
---
More like this happened during the Gene incident when he got removed and I didn’t get compensation for it I only got compensation for the other boxes I opened (195 boxes in total both regular and big) and since I didn’t get compensation for the $10 I spent I charged back 
---
BR NA AREA. ficou muito bom mano parabens
---
How well does he do on pizza?
---
I know that, I am still working on my movement and practicing. btw replays at 400 trophies lol
---
Netflix always make things worse with their ten dollar subscription
---
That piece of hair is bothering me
---
Can you confirm that you did not draw on the back?
---
The lines! Not the dumpling!
---
Trans mortys or bikini frank, choose one
---
How the heck do you have 19 brawlers at 3.1k
---
64k gold  and you get 200 at max in mega box 🤔 hmmmmm
---
If he is too OP, they will now make memes of getting nerfed
---
Literally anything at 0 trophies is OP.
---
I added you back. When are you available to play the most often?
---
Please curb ur dogs shit.. lol jk it actually looks cool lol
---
Crap my name is TJ on brawl stars never knew there was a little salty 9 year old of me
---
he looks derpy, I like that
---
We could always team up. I’m always itching to find another possible teammate. I don’t care about dropping trophies if we’re having good games/working strategy out.
---
Brasilllll porra
---
He is also trying to team with DynaMike
---
Idek, man. I am mostly f2p. I have only gotten like 3-4 brawlers from bought boxes.
---
glitch...?
---
The world has no idea, nor does Ryan or Frank
---
Same here. I will DM you?
---
Hate when that happens 
---
Lul
---
That works. I’m at work right now though :/
---
4, and all the time on the weekends especially at night
---
wait its like mortis is dressed up as the night witch no way thats crazy
---
Beating PunchThePie(pewdiepie) is good, being nerfed over and over again is bad(although leon needs a nerf)
---
ok thats fine. I will play tomorrow because I am gonna get off for today

It’s a wonderful meme tho

How to put brawler next to name in reddit?
---
Defence will be so strong 
---
Darryl or Nita?
---
Who said he needed it to wear on his feet? That’s actually spikes last gift he ever got from his parents before they were eaten by a desert Crow. 
---
Thanks!
---
Why can’t we have actual spike socks?
---
Lol it hasn't even been released but I like it
---
People who do what they did are just stupid. They had no one to defend
---
I would also like to know heheh
---
What I think? Well, sometimes I think that the world is really beautiful and I should go outside and just take a walk, then I stop thinking about that and get back to brawlstars!  
---
Good map idea btw. 
---
No I’m gonna FBI open up on her if ya know what I mean🍑🍆😉
---
4 normal mega box is 320 gem max tho.
---
I NEED A 10 V 10.

Does anyone know what the "incident" was?

Dude that's so awesome. How are you not in Supercell's company yet?
---
Also, are you Korean?

*tries to be corny with a spike voice line but remember he doesn't have one*
---
"Wanna play"
---
I refunded 100 bucks and i keep everything.
---
Spike is just a glorified creeper. Convince me otherwise. 
---
Probably be op as well
---
No
---
Spineapple
---
Oh god that's even worst, that'd be so hard because you could get trapped between bots. 
---
What even :/
---
Looks great! The cogs could me little pieces of the moon too! Good job 👍
---
I uplouded a draw
---
My bad
---
They need to add a bio of each brawler in the game
---
It will be. It has a different attack animation, and it’s not just a simple reskin. 
---
How about just a full hog rider skin, not a mechanical skin of a hog rider 
---
Wont be a problem with jump pads. Besides with dynamike and Barley's DPS then can ment them behind the wall.  Guess they could use a pam as the third for defense 
---
And her husband? :3
---
Me: i lost 70 due to siege! plz
---
\*sees you\*
---
Very, very late
---
What? 
---
How do you go to reddit
---
You are now in dept. You basically owe supercell gems now 
---
Sure as long as you provide proper credit :)
---
why did i know what the show is instantly
---
Great skin! Love the little pyramid
---
Oof dammit
---
UwU what’s this 0_o
---
aurelion sol super?
---
I think there is a setting for that idk if they removed it tho but it was there in beta 
---
Fortnite really paved the way for Pay to Play free games.
---
I will do that 
---
She’s good in bounty, but that’s it
---
Thought it was from alike ranchers
---
Agree with u..trash😕
---
Okay I'm a Reddit noob, can someone tell me how to get my map as the thumbnail for this post? I've been trying for half an hour and nothing's working.
---
What I mean is when you're on the normal r/Brawlstars home page and scrolling, isntead of seeing the .jpg thing ut shows the actual picture. Thanks!
---
Eh
---
I think matchmaking should be based on your total trophies and the power of the brawler you are using
---
Is mayonnaise an instrument 
---
Use piper
---
I don't have any epics
---
Hope that your luck isn’t as bad as mine I just recently got my first legendary and I’m at 11k
---
That’s actually really good! I like how it is more realistic than the others!
---
Pls nobody upvote this, this has 9 upvotes and the above has 6. Perfectly symmetrical
---
Oh I loke it
---
Please make more🙏🙏🙏🙏 such a talent. 
---
(Sr pelo scream)
---
ok. but how about the fact that playing with randoms is really shitty every time  lmao
---
Cheers legend 
---
u/vreddit_bot
---
why do you get mad? How many trophies do you have. Leon overall is not as good as you think. Watch videos on how to counter him.
---
Mortises voice lines are kept by the skin so... he
---
Still decent
---
why is his head on a cannon
---
Also for Golden Barley they could've changed his projectile
---
not really confirmed, might happen in the future
---
Excuse me
---
I'm at 5700 trophies. Used to be at 5800 but I went on a very long losing streak

lmao i got spike and crow before frank
---
What are you talking about?
---
Damnn
---
If u check him once his super is basically irrelevant cause he can’t engage anymore (unless he has a lot of power cubes)
---
The joke was clearly centered around his flair being spike. You saying that his flair checks out doesn’t add anything and is an easy karma grab, thus being directly related to the sub r/shootingfishinabarrel . Sorry for serious wording, just wanted to explain my reasoning correctly.
---
you've been playing too much lmao

 nice

he's just waiting for tge right moment.... don't worry
---
darryl voices?
---
Karma whoring on brawlstars subreddit... Wow  
---
Also no hat
---
Maybe はっぴ leon would be more culturally correct, but kimino leon works i guess
---
哈
---
Ohh my...
---
That time when the meteor targets a wall
---
I approve of this. 
---
So what? You lost cause the other team have better brawlers than your team, jessie there lmao
---
Had this happen before because I was just screwing around. I went to there spawn and died at the exact time we would have won with 10 gems. Still came back and won the game for my team though so it was all good
---
You are doing well typing in English. I know people who don’t make sense when they talk or text in English. 
---
...she doesn't need one.
---
Not really it used to appear all the tome back in beta they’re just using it less now to try out new maps
---
It's ridiculous, they we're supposed to change the match making pools to include total trophy count as well as brawler trophy count and almost every single one of my teammates today have had 5000 less trophies than me, it's so infuriating. People rushing to get 3v1d, people going afk for 45 seconds at a time, rushing in bounty the last 10 seconds when we're barely ahead, I just don't understand. I legitimately don't believe human beings are playing, there's no way people are that dense.

Here comes the lewds

Yeah! Achievements would definitely add something to strive for!
---
My point exactly. 
---
*cough* instagram *cough*
---
They couldn't even make a good drawing in 1 month then
---
The only thing I do not like about it is that it makes it very tough for Brawlers that cannot take boxes as quickly as others. Awesome looking map though. Looks like I would be fun as heck to ply.
---
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?
---
Alright now have some ants on a log or whatever and just take a breath 
---
what the
---
That literally made no sense... also supercells are the centers of tornados... supercell is the company
---
It won’t come back. Offers are typically when they’re newly released. :/
---
Lol 4k no legendary why are you complaining?
---
Honestly I don’t even know why they made it so we can buy only 1 pack per week. But I don’t want to have to wait multiple weeks just to spend all of my gems on the 80gem ticket pack. 
---
It supposed to look funny like Mortis putting makeup on and clothes, and not to look like the real thing 
---
This. If Brawl Stars did something to mitigate this, it would be 10x better. No other one thing feels as bad as this.
---
This is extremely rude and has been reported.
---
I don’t care who made it first I really like this. Supercell should put this in the game 
---
Oh man I feel so demotivated
---
A pencil and Photoshop
---
Yes you are 
---
It's so badly made
---
Love it
---
Yes please! I love the Egyptian culture
---
WHAT ELSE DO YOU NEED MORE THAN LIFE  CAUSE I NEED IT
---
Cut your losses. Never use the same Brawler after losing twenty trophies. Doing so will only increase your frustration. 
---
Water in the center is odd for this gamemode as it really limits 5he amount of bolts that can spawn
---
Nice meme, bro.
---
I thinks some people might not know that Cacnea is a Pokemon
---
That * thing * can't be fixed... I'm sorry
---
6k is the start of frustration... you will understand what I’m saying on your road to 7k
---
Maybe mega boxes only when there's a deal available
---
Okay, I’m just gonna put this out here, you guys need to know these are TRAPS. They’re not a method of transport and should generally be avoided
---
It's looking like spike is going to win. 
---
How many trophies you have?
---
Wait for discounted gene, he can appear randomly for a discounted price of 269
---
Friendly Battle xd
---
Gene "voice lines"
---
What do you mean, ‘instead’ of star shelly. We have star shelly for like 3 months now, why is this getting upvoted, this is an idea that would’ve been passable when global launched, you know this is 1000% not going to happen right
---
I agree. I don't like being invited to friendly games with 2-3 players and 7-8 bots. I feel bad declining the invitations, but I would feel a bit better declining friendly games with bots if I knew which mode I am being invited to play. 
---
Lol yeah the discount is bigger but it won't make me buy this shit 
---
It sounds good but the problem is that most of the time when you put penny’s cannon down, it’s behind cover. 
---
Please remodel this to Gedhi Kors design (idk how to spell his username). It was a fantastic remodel, and no offense, but this hurts to look at 
---
I know your pain and more. Still haven't unlocked Pam.
---
Feels bad man 
---
Yes do it
---
So they changed the background for 1 skin?
---
Yeah I don't know why you guys like mortis being dressed as a girl.  His voice makes it even worse. 
---
Is cheaper if you buy they 1 by 1 (cost 479 gems i think), so you are going to pay close to 100 gems more to get then now.  Still, after pay 900 gems, 100 isnt too much, and you save time of getting both offerts.
---
Same day action i see
---
Don't know why but I only get like 5 pulls from a mega box
---
i bought it because it is ugly enough :D
---
It was a clash royale event i think
---
On point! Kudos to the Supercell for even just spending the time to meme and kid us with a horrid skin
---
This is the best skin ever
---
Is there any fixing this abomination of a skin 😂 it's like nailing jello to a wall
---
The skin is a part of that event. The music and background another
---
But the M E M E S
---
honestly i’m with you but its tempting cus they might remodel it and then you would regret not getting it
---
B A L A N C E D
---
He’s pretty average, that’s just some fucking amazing plays
---
Looks like a cool idea, although if one team had close range brawlers, thy would have trouble with long rangers snipers from across the water
---
See my latest post

What does the pyramid shoot?

Trophies?
---
Is something wrong with this guy?
---
Fucking A+ cut
---
&gt; wooshed people
---
I see what you did there
---
If you have the money and really want them then do it. I love playing spike. He’s my favorite. 
---
Buffing Crow would be the 3/4
---
Yeah, I was hoping it was a joke as well. I must be talking for the whole community when saying that thing is hideous. 
---
@Art team, I know you stated this skin to be “a funny take on a Mortis skin” but for real though. 
---
No?
---
Please leave a lot of comments.
---
you actually bought the skin?
---
I suspect I know what happened... Supercell may have introduced turn speed to movement controls. If I want to turn instantly then I have to let go of the movement and choose a new direction to move in. 
---
Please revert these changes. It feels so bad to play right now
---
Don’t know why they put a girl skin for a guy character
---
If the pic is not working I'm talking about the lady mortis
---
Not even a single legen... If he is global, he must be around -1000. If he is beta, around 8000.

That smile that damn smile

I have rockabilly.  You can't make me think that he is not the best skin in the game 
---
The problems that you’re talking about are basically invisible when in-match. The lipstick is part of the ‘joke’, but I would agree that shoes would’ve been nice. It’s by no means an amazing skin, but all these little kids in their bandwagon are just saying it’s bad because everyone else is saying it’s bad. Like how last week they were all saying ‘buff crow’
---
Yeah gamodes which are risky to play 
---
Yes just to see what it is like in game. It actually looks good because you dont see her face lol

You have been banned from Youtube for mentioning YouTube outside YouTube. 
---
Booked under Section69:YouTube violations
---
Honestly supercell staff needs more brain cells to  balance crow maybe that’s why they are money suckers
---
I looked at your posts and I can see why your getting the karma 
---
Keep up the good posts 
---
Ty so much 😍
---
sooooooo cute
---
Wait till u reach level 10 and realise he desperately needs a buff
---
Why do you stop your study to play a mobile game???
---
Yeah, they are underestimating the skin by far
---
Give him slippers or smth ffs
---
lol

#NWMORTISGANG

It's cool!
---
But it's cooler if you remove the water
---
Hoping for 999,999 diamonds for free.
---
Cause he's a nerd
---
*Witch mortis
---
I see your comment sir... and I give you an upvote.
---
lol idk why i was studying chemistry i'm only 11 year old 
---
Why I didnt get the deal for mortis skin? :(
---
Are you mad ? They should pay me for using it.
---
yeah but I shouldn’t have to deal with auto aim in the shop lol I never clicked the Night Witch Mortis and very clearly picked the power points. it randomly popping up is probably why it is disabled for now 
---
Nice! This is pretty insane. I haven't got to this high yet :(
---
In game it's pretty cool, but in the menu is kinda ugly
---
By the way, I really like this screenshot and want to use it as one of the thumbnails on my blog. Can I do that? Will mention your name as the credits for sure!
---
If that's the case then probably. Not reading what you click on can't help.
---
and luner new year Colt.
---
No just no
---
Just want to know how bad my luck is haha.
---
I've got all the brawlers minus the legendaries and Gene. 6k~ trophies
---
What did you just saying?!?!
---
The layout looks nice, but why is the right side slimmer than the left?
---
Don't forget about turrets and bears.. ramdons never kill them for you and as mortis that is nothing you can do against it... playing mortis with ramdon is almost impossible
---
Wasn't sure if it was intentional or not so I put it in strategy anyway 
---
i'm losing trophies on purpose cause is the only fun thing to me and i get no brawler losing trophies is fun
---
So sad about this. For that price I would have bought it to annoy people and possibly get them lose focus thus helping me win. The full price is bit much for such trolling.
---
Penny Carl
---
Now that's value
---
And Dharkon’s gonna be Nita or Leon
---
It should coat 10 gems
---
Lol
---
He slams down on his cart
---
r/thiccochet wants to have a wors witu you
---
no its gone, its 150
---
i guess u just dont play as much. im a beta android player and got to 10k in 3 months
---
See, i pulled a little sneaky on ya
---
You will unlock him for sure whem Carl launch.... happened to me with Gene... save boxes and get Mortis .. hahaha
---
Brawl stars is not 2 years old it's 1,5. Also damn you are still luckier than me
---
DAMN. I wanted it to buy later..why did that happened?
---
Petition denied
---
Have you ever played this game?
---
Well the base cost for a super rare is 80 gems, and there is usually a discount. I'm hoping 57 gems cause that's all I've got haha
---
If you put him an hat it's basically Ricochet 
---
Nothing special I had all 3 legendaries as a free to lay in like 900 trophies
---
Yes just yes
---
I miss a little 😔
---
Its not in the shop anymore what happened 
---
I mean EA has completely fixed star wars battlefront 2, but tok
---
I started like 2 months ago and i'm at 4.5k but still no epic, mythic, or legendary
---
I didn't get this offer ... Totally unfair supercell
---
well you should get them both to a high rank, shelly is good if you are more of camping and barley is good cuz he can trow over walls
---
Downvote this now pls, it's a sad attempt at gaining karma
---
r/gatekeeping a guy who just wants some new brawlers to play around with 
---
I would recommend not focusing on one but becoming well diversified for the different game modes 
---
yayyy another gene buff... :/
---
Your luck is pretty good actually
---
free box
---
This is fake right? Would they really discount an 150 skin down to 59 and then not give that offer to everyone.
---
Cow just cow
---
you can always leave reddit
---
Lol I think they overbuffed him tbh, he was already so good on release. But hes my main so ^_^
---
:) love it
---
If you ran forward it would have gone in as well with Brock not being a heavyweight.
---
Nope, they just made a mistake and they are correcting it to 109 gems
---
That'll be sick 
---
There’s no music
---
I am offended down vote
---
Do you live in Brazil? if not, it's good to know that it's not just funk and football is known by other people
---
good fake 
---
You bought it when the offer wasn’t running, it’s like asking for a gem refund because you bought a mega box for 80 gems and now it’s in shop for 49
---
Pls don't homie...
---
Thought it was a new brawler leak
---
Nice edit! Take my upvote
---
Ikr, weird...
---
Don't worry about your English, everybody understood you. But next time use "Bought"
---
Same
---
No balls to buy it on your main
---
Nope still ugly
---
This is awesome 👌🏼
---
My lowest drop rate is 0.0096
---
Honestly tho I thought it was gonna be much better
---
What do u mean by remodel?
---
Adds fuel to the pandemic
---
It sucks
---
Sexy
---
Всё потому что он русский😂
---
what a shit hing to do :/
---
Realy buff crow!!!!
---
I used 100 gems for top hat mortis
---
correct
---
Through the lauch pad (that block with an arrow)
---
Famen
---
Piper **milf**
---
Any chance they could adjust the mortis skin to not exist?
---
Pretty much.
---
Tbh is cool
---
I sell it
---
give credit to u/atolline please
---
Yes m8
---
My highest drop rate was 0.29%
---
I would say that
---
Oh i missed that. Nice map tho.
---
this is honestly a nerf
---
Serves you right for buying that mess 
---
Beautiful
---
The fockin shit
---
The eyes are different
---
Imagine jumping to one of those islands with vases with Piper, Primo or Crow
---
It's maintenance or dodgy servers, just let them do their job
---
If you go look at your posts you have Leon, but you probably stole that picture. Also Jesus you’ve been posting like 2 posts per minute 
---
No Darryl, mayonnaise is not an instrument
---
Gene can now pull the Healing Station to far away from the enemy team
---
such value 
---
0 cup and MORTİS!!!
---
A good approach, but you lost some of what  made the map amazing when you tried to focus on it:
---
1. The jump pad element that made it so unique is near gone now.
---
2. There’s not really any middle in this map.
---
3. A bit too much bushes.
---
That's really depressing
---
True
---
Congrats
---
Now I learned the lesson why you need a watermark lel😂
---
That isn't a shit thing to do, despite how it turned out it's still a premium skin and will most likely get a minor remodel soon. They made a mistake on their end on the gems pricing and if you didn't buy it then then you only have yourself to blame.
---
He look like Leon!
---
thanks! It wasn't that hard to make :)
---
They put everything on sale at release...
---
https://youtu.be/1IBMuFiZUgI
---
Gostei mano! 
---
Parabens pela ideia!
---
bruh r you living in the past or something 
---
I think the gem grab map rn is really good for mortis, just go for barleys and dynamikes I guess
---
Wow
---
I've been keep reuploading this since there was too much to fix sorry people :(
---
This is confusing as fuck, and I love it
---
yeah then they should’ve put him on sale when he was released
---
YOU GOT: 16 Coins, 4 Bull Power Points, 4 Frank Power Points.
---
Darryl is gonna be so broken in this map
---
*iS MaYoNNaIsE aN inStrUmenT?*
---
The theme is that if you jump, you'll be trapped.
---
Love your art!
---
I love you both
---
Wat are you talking about I don't understand
---
Jesus your whole account is just “why do I not have a legendary”. If you’re mad at the game for not getting a legendary, just quit it! We won’t miss you 
---
Lewd the Jessie
---
cOmE oN! We CaN dO tHiS!
---
what do you not understand 
---
#HOW?!?!
---
That is not a good idea to have in a map
---
You don't really play with randoms above 300 
---
Imagine people playing dina and barley on these new maps lol, and even if they do , theres alwyas a stupid shelly leon or poco peeling and healing them
---
Wasn’t your idea
---
New 3D model. Change her appearence.
---
There are some brawlers who are very old, and their models aren't very good... they can have errors, they don't have details... and some of them are harder to create skins with.
---
So, they get a remodel (new 3D Model) with details, no errors, better appearence (most times), and, they are better to receive skins.
---
If you look at the first Brawl Stars version, you will see how many remodels we had and how they're so different from their first version.
---
They can't do anything, your friend didn't wait for a discount, his loss. Too bad :/
---
The offer's confirmation box(?) Is way bigger than it appears. It covers up almost all of the freebie and the one underneath it, meaning if you tap on the freebie you'll prolly somehow be on the skin purchase confirmation screen.
---
I will buy this offer only for Mortis!
---
*IS mAyoNnAisE aN inStRuMeNT?*
---
We might be good on the ideas but they have to do a 3D model of it
---
Whoa how come u tilt 300+ trophies sosad. 
---
Holy shit thats SO LUCKY
---
r/crowgang supports this
---
Wait for special offers, with the gems you get try to always buy 1000 token doubler and you should be alright
---
Main issue, eyes as blood cells makes no sense
---
My thanks, kind sir/madam
---
Lol..... why did they do that? Carl?
---
The map is made for all characters.) And well balanced.
---
Please Please PLEASE!!!!
---
Trust me u don’t want that skin 
---
Really buff crow... also this doens't make sense for gene.. now jessie can stay behing her turret and if gene try to take her he will take the turret.... and with star power she can easily heal the turret and kil the poor Gene. His super should go through turrets and healing stations
---
Go directly to the skin in the brawler menu, it’s there for 59 gems 
---
Really buff crow
---
Is it going to get expensive or it will stay the same price ? 
---
They are getting there, I giess socks are easyer then balancing, but, hey, like this leon is not totally killed, imagine what would become of him if crow were meta
---
Like in the update where the also changed him into thiccochet
---
Agreed 
---
**sr pelo gasp**
---
Yes there is
---
Yep
---
U just cursed yourself for eternity
---
Deadly...
---
Best joke ab it yet😂
---
It's real--- check this subreddit r/brawlsatrs
---
Really decent. 
---
The game is back to normal
---
^---^
---
Once you have a brawler at lvl 9 a small box yields a chance of 1% of unlocking the star power. If you have no brawler at lvl 9 the chance to unlock a star power is 0%.
---
Sexy!
---
Bruh that’s overpriced 
---
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 한국인 정모 또시작
---
ass heart
---
It only takes 3 days to get a big box though.
---
mt bom kkkkkkk
---
Buy the Megabox
---
This somehow reminds me of my old nostalgic arrow.io days
---
not really a buff now brawlers like Jessie and penny can defend themselves from his grab
---
NW Mortis is really ugly, but in my opinion NW Mortis looks really cool ingame overall, so I can´t complain, but I can understand why he gets so much hate.
---
Yea, as Robert Said, not with randoms. At least with one teamate it would be fine.
---
I wanna see clay spike too. 
---
Well, maybe Gene could do the job, right?
---
Guess you're right!
---
F
---
Just give him a skin with classic Ricco, like Top Hat Mortis. All the Ricco Elitists will use classic, just like Top Hat Mortis
---
crow and gene
---
I've NEVER seen ANYONE complaining about Life Leech and then, they remove! The only... "Perfect" modifier we had, with no RNG.
---
While all the other RNG modifiers which there's always some complain, they don't remove! Let's just keep the worst and remove the best...
---
I'm talking about this in here:

---
yeah I know. Clash Royale's 3rd bday 
---
Meteor would prevent bush camping very well if it wasn't so randomised, I swear half the time if stalks someone until they're dead.
---
You should name it Cärl.
---
Btw great idea!
---
This isn’t a buff. Nobody wants to waste their special grabbing a healing turret
---
Be r e a d y t o s a y g o o d b y e t o y o u r g e m s
---
Hell no because there are only 2 or 3 blocks between another wall. U need more for seige.
---
Yes I've had it target me for about 30 seconds before opponents slaughtered me. As I said, Meteor Shower is broken rn but could be improved (whether SC can or will improve it is a different question). Energy Drink I'm fine with (although it promotes Darryl too much), but back when non-SD maps had modifiers Bounty+Energy Drink was broken as hell. Like if you weren't able to dominate the most of the map in early game, the opponent would just grab all spawned energy drinks and slaughter you.
---
What if the circle is attached somehow at the cannon?
---
More like only 1 block. U need like 4 or 3
---
Exactly luke I tried to give u an insight on what the support team has to say about the missing mortis +skin offer but what u do is talk about how I mistyped haha the with thr what a lad 
---
You are karma farming, get out
---
Bull: heavy breathing
---
"New brawler crow"
---
Does this sound weird to anyone 🤔
---
Naw dude I don’t want you to waist ur gems like that.
---
Don't woosh me if I didn't got the joke but..  I'm pretty sure Pam is very strong in Showdown, mainly in open maps.
---
Already raging at 809 trophies and you have spike? Ok
---
Only a couple brawlers can get the ball. The ball spawn has to be bigger so alevery brawler can go through
---
Not really, the skin looks fine ingame, and the animations look really good
---
Shouldnt spike be Kevin?
---
Also the spawns.
---
Suggestion, the robot in siege auto targets the turret by jumping on the Spring trap (if not already activated)
---
Just stop
---
The wind speaks to me 😆
---
El primo, is here
---
Have much fear, Mortis is here!
---
Lol this was just my guess based on what I heard from other people. Apparently there were quite a few idiots who reported the life leech as a "bug" when they didn't know it was actually a modifier.
---
You right...
---
True. So I'll leave reddit and suffer from my spelling mistake for eternity.
---
God please no
---
it's like Cavern Churn
---
It's my friend's phone and account 😂
---
Life leech was definitely one of the best game modes, only had the chance to try it like two times. Is was perfect on Feast or Famine.
---
I'm with 8.5k, no legendaries yet. And I can't get out of it... 
---
i bought it
---
Does night witch mortis have special effects in game?
---
Same here. Idk why people hate this skin so much.
---
Someone explain this to me o_O
---
Isn't Pam quite strong in showdown?
---
its trash but its funny for the memes
---
Yeah but Supercell doesn't hire anybody. Plus, these guys are supposed to do this for their living. BTW we're 124k on this subreddit (not millions):p
---
***keep your voice down***
---
No 1 block caps allowed. Why people do this?
---
Why it doesn’t add anything
---
os brasileiros vão dominar o mundo ainda hahaha
---
But it would be great if it were implemented.
---
No. Because
---
1) Skins don't affect gameplay.
---
2) Supercell needs the money to develop new games. They can't give away everything for free.
---
3)This game is the most f2p friendly game (even outside supercell). What more do you want?
---
Hmm fair. My thought was that it's aesthetic and therefore subjective. So it may be that I loved the old skin but hate the new skin because it doesn't suit my tastes. Just like if I bought a shirt and someone came and altered it. It may be an improvement but I don't like it.
---
But yeah there will probably not be any refund offer just saying that it's been on my mind. I've never even bought a skin. 😂😂 Idk why that question has been on my mind. 
---
Crow needs to be nerfed
---
yes

I wasnt being patient enough, I was able to connect eventually...

It is so sad

Alvaro best girl

😈

Tell me what guys think
---
Removed - This is an English speaking subreddit, characters not in the English language have been detected in your title. This may have been caused by emojis.
---
That makes no sense, probably a mistake...
---
I hope the game starts working as support says: You should be allowed to buy skins without having the Brawler!
---
Yea but an 8 year old doesn’t care
---
Well i hope it's a mistake xD
---
Nice
---
it’s a good trick.  
---
You were probably going to town in the club chat
---
Rabatt. Die sind doch auf den Kopf gefallen haha hab übrigens das gleiche. Das muss ein Fehler sein. 
---
Sure, the design is bad. That’s not what’s wrong. 
---
What’s wrong is that the devs literally said they made the skin as a joke. The joke derives from mortis being made into a woman. 
---
I have Leon and Crow in my shop for a deal of 1039 gems, and then a second limited time deal showed up for Spike and the pink skin for 3989 gems...
---
??? What is this post?
---
Yes that can be an awesome addition to the game 
---
The joke is the skin is ugly. That’s it. 
---
It's a joke
---
I just wanted to point out for the developers to fix it
---
Safe
---
Are you kidding me? I was the first one to post about thus and only got like, 150 updoots
---
r/itswooooshwith4os
---
You can use Darryl el primo bull crow piper dynamikes max 
---
You got a problem bud,he doesnt have a neck
---
   
---
Thank you for your praise.  :)
---
Maybe it's a bug
---
I guess I can't argue that Shelly's voice actor is Fem Scout.
---
Thank you for your advice
---
Just a breakdown from this image: Side offer is 258.5 gems for a mythic brawler and the new NW skin would cost 59 gems. Supercell is telling me that  258.5 gems+59 gems=2099 gems? No thank you, I wont pay 6x the price of it. 
---
My team actually beat the robot 
---
Wow don’t think anybody’s posted this yet today
---
I have a spike in shop for 4000 gems
---
That's like 115€ or even more
---
Now players can just strafe around their turret to not get picked off by gene. This is a jessie buff 100% 
---
5v5 IS NEEDED HOW DO WE NOT HAVE IT YET
---
Have you been in a coma for the past 3 Months? 
---
It turned into a P2W’s Wet Dream 
---
Just wanted to break down. Look at my comment above
---
You can fuck right off
---
Then maybe uninstall and reinstall but make sure u can retrieve your account (connect to Facebook or supercell ID)
---
These "new" players had to have 800 trophies. By that time...you can read the events in detail.
---
Sorry for my poor editing skills. This post was made by Paint
---
Are you cavallini pietro? 
---
That is what I think. No idea why it happens.
---
Oh wow. Uhmm.
---
LIMITED TIME DISCOUNT HURRY GUYS
---
Cause someone said it as a joke and the mad lads actually made it. It looks ridiculous, that’s all there is to it.
---
They made a mistake and added an extra 9. Should be fixed soon.
---
Even after relogging its the same.
---
What the fuck is happening to their game.
---
You gonna get a tattoo of the Tesla sign, get a Tesla jacket, get a Tesla hat but not own a Tesla? 
---
“Discount”?! That’s like $210 for the brawler
---
White crow lowers the price lmao
---
Cheap
---
Hmmm which one to get.
---
Uhmm the fuck?
---
r/PamGang :D
---
Supercell is smoking crack!
---
Gene was just in my shop for over $100
---
Let's hate it more, to price go to 0
---
Idk but 230$ for a legendary???
---
PS: im not good at english 
---
Skins at 59 gems and mythic brawler at 340, How 340 + 59 = 2099 ?
---
Excuse me but WTF Supercell... That's the biggest inflation I have saw in my life!
---
Do you watch youtube tutorial? If you do suggest some to me please. 
---
I read your comment in Barely's voice
---
Hello theree
---
Anyone can tell me what is this?
---
Haven't you learned your lesson about what happens when the Clash universe and the Brawl universe collide?!
---
It’s the “nip and tuck” skin, after the sex change lol
---
Idk what the purple pinky stuff is but the brawler looks like a dragon knight jessie 
---
Facts lol
---
haha good joke
---
Lmao
---
Too open
---
Mine done it in purpose and made it lose on purpose, this game pushed me back from my goal too often. They don't want to admit it but it's a pay to win game. I easy can go into rank 15. But once you are in rank 15, suddenly everybody on the enemy team is Lvl 10. 
---
Is it Mario Brothersor Donkey Kong? Lol
---
Man, your art is sick. How do you finish so quickly. Your last post was only a day ago when night witch mortis was released.
---
That’s something I can agree on. Kairos makes the point that getting gears is the only thing he can excel in, however that really is important 
---
too late m8
---
I disliked it because to an extent it limited the number of easily usable brawlers(healers, some longer range brawlers). Not only that, but the bigger problem was being forced TOO much into attacking others, which led to less tactical play. If I'm for example a shelly, I'm forced to rush in and attack while leads to less tactical play by being forced into battles. 
---
That being said, it shouldn't have been removed. those problems are fixable by decreasing leech damage
---
Internet: _TOO LATE_
---
Depends on the map and I think barley isn’t A here
---
You also forgot the new siege mode and a new brawler this March, but ight
---
idc
---
You have never played against Pam on certain Gem Grab maps if you think a healing tank is not worth a super at times.
---
P E N N Y
---
why doesn't supercell hire you?
---
Rly 5k gems lol
---
I just played normally lol, with randoms.
---
But (I found out just today) the meta is, Jessie is the **best** option, Brock, Rico, penny, Frank, barley are **Very Good** options
---
bull when the bush starts speaking "bling bling"*
---
ah thats hot
---
I’ve seen mostly night witch, so much money being thrown around just for aesthetics 
---
Plz add skin in game september 13th fri
---
I’m looking forward to it
---
Dont buy it bro its a waste of money 😪🙄
---
좋게 봐주셔서 감사합니다 ㅎㅎ
---
They’re from Finland. They can’t English 
---
I agree with you, but someone did post a comment saying they did not think supercell made this skin to be cool, they made it to be funny. Ryan commented back and said the a
---
Art Team agreed with that comment. 
---
Get rid of one tile gaps 
---
Oh. There was certain version of the game that didn't let you enter the game
---
Take what kairos says with a pinch of salt, most of the brawlers can be S class when used properly and with the right team composition.
---
Oh wait, I just realised you said **today's**
---
Today's is definitely penny, whenever you get your super , sneak in from the side bushes and spawn your mortar at the corner when the opp team is not close
---
At least you have epics. I’m at 6.5k and have no epics, mythics, or legendaries. Can’t wait for Carl so I can finally gain some easy trophies.
---
Depends on the maps, the one we have currently is terrible for tanks but the map before hand was great for bulls.
---
But Jesse, Penny, Colt, and genie are used a lot 
---
That deal should be 519 without the bug. 519 is super valuable imo since the skin alone already costs 300 gems. 219 for a legendary, man thats super saver. 
---
I was worried about the name. At first I tried to named 13th fri mo.
---
Hahahah..u said reach level 10
---
Sorry?He is C TIER in siege good dammnit
---
Yea, he fucking is -_-
---
Uh No.... My name is even in it
---
Jessie goes sicko mode
---
Free box man. Do it. 
---
He’s great for mid control
---
Internet speed is 50 mb/down if I’m playing with wifi (although I’ve tried using multiple different wifi connections) and data speed varies but it doesn’t matter which one I use - neither connect. Also thank you for replying!!!
---
**EDIT** **4**: Mortis offer is back in the shop for 239 gems. However you can only get Mortis. For the skin, I believe you can still can get it in the brawler selection screen with the other skins for 59 gems. 
---
And I would also like to not see the health numbers in most modes, the enemy shouldn’t be able to gauge your level based on hp
---
r/BrawlStarsThieves 
---
Thank you. I am aiming for one skin per day.:)
---
I guy in my club got Spike at 400 trophies and didn’t like him because he was “hard to use”. Sad to see his Spike staying at 6 trophies for a while. 
---
Thanks for the arrows, I doubt I would’ve seen the circle
---
And you forgot tis supposed to be a joke. 
---
Do I like this skin? 
---
No. 
---
Do i think they will improve the skin? 
---
Yes. 
---
Should I buy the skin because it's on a big discount right now? 
---
Yes.
---
Also the fact that the skin is so unpopular kind of makes it special when you play it or see it
---
We better demand a male Pam skin, and a female frank 
---
I propose respawning works like Robo Rumble or Boss Fight. A slightly longer respawn time (not as long as those two), but you'll respawn next to a teammate.
---
And if you look on my profile
---
(tribe BE × RedTyo) you see my mortis is tilted that bad
---
I like that Crossover meme!😂
---
I still do not have enough experience to practice. Everything is not just a bust. When I get more done ...?
---
Lol, the original did not have that name, why do you have to be such an asshole? Atleast give credits...
---
Not VERY good, but still nice.
---
His super should allow his shots to continue reloading, I’m sick of having road hog syndrome when I hook them and have no shots to kill them
---
Gene can hit it too, as well as rico when angled perfectly to bounce off the box. Penny's super is the most efficient way to abuse this range, already discovered by someone else, but Spike don't have to use his supers.
---
He isn't even out yet...
---
Why am i not getting any offers
---
Piper no-go zone ;( not very playable but looks fancy, lots of effort gone into it!
---
Have you ever played against him 
---
Link me the original pls i did't know somebody Already made this.... Its a common meme template
---
Hajabawaya
---
Definitely one of the best skin concepts I would pay !
---

---
//Jessie appears//
---
well alright then, hope you are not lying.
---
You best believe  still gonna use my main man poco though
---
🤦‍♂️Why can’t I do this...
---
That's what i was thinking
---
Buff crow tho
---
Check Mortis himself. It didn’t appear in the shop for anyone.
---
I cant fi'd an original.. If you see it you see this pic is on my account with my gems and my mortis tilt lol
---
Why are you useing internet explorer 
---
Wow. The one of them? Thank u :)
---
It was a damn typo you idiot, how could you have not noticed 🤦🏽‍♂️
---
How many gems did you have when the offer came out? Was it enough to get the offer? I have a theory but just wanna comfirm with you.
---
why are you the way that you are
---
Wonderful cuz they will fix the skin
---
Thank you for the advice
---
XD
---
Lol wow carl tip ! #Carl
---
Omg I just saved 719gems. Got crow from a blue box then purchased the 60 gem box on offer and got Gene. Glad I was already on the toilet when I got it!
---
Is it a mistake? Even a non-discounted legendary is only around 700 and no skin is worth over a 1000.
---
I'm at 1.2k and I have Spike, Crow, and Mortis.  Sorry about your luck.  I don't understand how some can be so lucky and others get nothing.  One of my cousins has had Clash Royale for 2 weeks and already has 2 legendary cards, I've been playing since global launch and I still need like 3 of them.  Supercell must have something to do with the luck of some and the starving of others.
---
The player logic:
---
Spike is easy as fuck to use.  If you're decent at leading and you know some of the explosion patterns you can slay with spike.
---
The discount is basically a coupon, coupons have expiration dates. 
---
If you go to McDonald's and order a happy meal with a coupon can you come back a week later to pick it up? 
---
The dart brawler is very well thought out. How will the three darts be chosen? First ammo for that second for that... Or just random? 
---
F
---
I’d definitely say it opens the mechanic of taking away Pam’s turret and destroying Penny’s mortar which is helpful so that’s a pro. But I do think that accidentally grabbing a jessie turret may happen which wouldn’t be good lol
---
Thicco is overrated.
---
Approved by r/mortisgang
---
This is Jessy
---
Sorry just being a ftp player its lucky to get it but thanks its good to know how nice the brawlstars community is
---
POOR FRANK WHO BECAME THE MOST RICH AT LAST XD.
---
Got her to 500 using it! So op
---
That would inflate trophies. No thanks.
---
Couldn't agree more, it have one of the best attack&amp;super animations, at the cost of the eyesore Everytime you go back to the menu.
---
Its not a bug its a strategy bro
---
You're right
---
u/MaybeMark Spike is absolutely not weak.  He's good on most maps in every game mode.  I don't even main Spike, mine's like rank 12, and I can out 1v1 most other brawlers with him.  After Leon's nerf, I consider Spike to be the best legendary.
---
×2
---
Even if you got killed you may be in the lead. Also the range to your island would be too long for any brawler to kill you. Darryl, Bull and Primo are the only brawler with a chance to go to the island, but even they wouldn't have a chance against a whole team waiting for them. 
---
It would take 30 sec just for the fight to start😂😂
---
Bull has entered the chat 
---
I play this game every day and I opened 3 brawl boxes every day but the drop rates didn't change..Still I didn't get any legendary mythic or epic brawler but when I see another players profile they got legendary brawlers at just 500 or 800 Tropies..are the really lucky or we are very unlucky..Somebody reply that you have to pay for the game but man some of the players like me cannot afford to pay in the game what should we do.I already wrote this in the review box of the game. Please give me valid reason.HELP plzzz
---
So many good works on reddit and they decide to put a transmortis in the game. Sad.
---
You can stand inside the circle and not get targetted by the machine
---
Wow, that's good!
---
Outstanding move
---
Poco goes to an American school to preform for the kids
---
Seriously I’ve based a full maxed +star power team while I’m a lvl 8 poco with only one maxed out star power tm8 sometimes the matchmaking is bad based on power lvls but this is not that time
---
obviously. nw mortis was supposed to be 109 gems but accidentally ended up in 59. fixed it and created new issues.
---
Ah.. well that makes sense. 
---
No puddles i see
---
There is nothing wrong with That, it just means you have to pay more attention and not let them get past your defence

Would you play penny or bo if they did this?

Gene: * Unintelligible singing *
---
He has a lvl 7 poco and lvl 6 Leon??!!?! That’s the real confusing part
---
great!!!
---
A furry..
---
Lol fail name :/
---
can we pull boxes in showdown?
---
Yea, it does look awesome! It's just when I think Jason, for some reason I think Frank lol
---
only good for collecting nuts.he Cant handle other brawlers that are good in siege like frank,bull,primo,pam, jessie(turret) etc.
---
Penny is also gold TBH, her cannon can get some cheap damage onto the enemy if placed well
---
Night with mortis alternative
---
Okie dokie, but I would use brock bec he can easily melt squishies like colt or tara etc even in close range. Piper is also pretty dang good! :D     And btw fun tip: If you go to the bounce pad thingies, you are I N V I N C I B L E  for a few seconds, and by that moment, you can reload in the air or absorb the mechanical bolts or whatever in your turret heist box... You know what I mean. Thats a little advantage, but still a advantage.  Hope its helpful! :)
---
ToP oF tHe ScRap HeaPp
---
I get that; I’m pointing out OPs reasons for the post.. 
---
lmao
---
everyone is talking about him, but i don’t see him in my game? is he on the live servers yet?
---
Im pn 5,2 and have 20 brawlers😂
---
useful for breaking walls maybe?...
---
will trade you mortis and frank, i hate using both of them, give me piper and pam anyday
---
I mean your 200 idea its too op , it would change completly a meta it would make other brawlers to play in a different way of playing considering it would change dmg per second
---
when the teacher gives a little too much homework
---
How long have you been playing 
---
he didn't find usefulness of his super consistent while testing.
---
As a representative of the r/pocogang I hereby approve this post
---
How many trophies are u on?
---
You actually need teammates who know how to pass unfortunately 
---
I have spike, but I dont have gene, bec im free2play. #moreskinsforfreetoplayersbecousewearepoorandthisisajoke
---
should have put mortis skin
---
How many trophies do you have 
---
Don’t go penny 😂
---
Wait that's illegal
---
I don't feel so good... 
---
I would be more worried about Pam's turret.
---
One of my friends and I both pulled Gene from brawl boxes earlier today! Super happy ❤️
---
#I also hate it too
---
#I LOST MORE THAN 30 TROPHIES WITH IT

@funny_brawl
---
ult with Darryl into the river in such a way that you get stuck bouncing between the walls, the result should be interesting
---
I win very consistently in this mode even though I'm underlevelled. Not bragging, as I don't do very well in some of the other modes, I just happen to understand how to control space in siege rlly well. 
---
Some people just don't get how it works yet. Hence all of my teammates being Bull and Primo in today's map and guaranteeing a loss because the map is a wide open field &gt;:^(
---
A map shouldn’t be dependent on certain skills. It doesn’t have to be viable for every brawler, but it shouldn’t be ruined if nobody can break walls.
---
I would have this offer so much ! Do you have all others brawler ?
---
Me too!
---
This reminds me of showdown
---
Hmm, I have always thought he needed a faster projectile, but with his current damage he can 3-shot Pam, so I think they went a good way
---
Let her win lol she would be confused.
---
I dont team, the gamemode was cancer for close-range brawlers and it was infested with Brocks and Dynamikes or other long range brawlers. I play close-range brawlers. You got a problem with my opinion?
---
If it's a legit pic then yeah it's gotta be a bug. That is almost 10 time the gem cost that Gene should be.
---
That’s not fair mine was more expensive and didn’t include the skin: 
---
https://i.imgur.com/MLiyIZc.jpg
---
😅 I wanted do 1vs3 but for some reason I did 1vs5😅
---
Well, overestimated by close
---
Good God when did things get that expensive?? Got even my leon for less than 300gems before gene release. This is ridiculous
---
this will be such a mess
---
Oh ok my bad
---
If both of you paid 2099 gems for Gene, you paid too much.
---
Yes, I know.
---
For the 100th time..
---
They removed life leech because of new players
---
All other modifiers SPAWNS SOMETHING either thats a meteor that damages you or mushrooms that heals you, but life leech PASSIVELY affects you 
---
From new players perspective, It WAS confusing (also I have a poll going on about life leech and event modifier)
---
I loved life leech too
---
We can't always have what we want
---
Just forget it and deal with it, Tbey might be thinking of Life leech based gamemode
---
ABLAHBLAHBLABLAHLAHBLA!
---
I love it!
---
If you shoot instantly when it is reloaded, you will fire another earth dart, since the first ammo slot is restricted for earth darts only. 
---
Thx
---
May be
---
Sort of yep :)

I actually have every brawler except these two.

If you really paid 2099 gems for a mythic brawlee, you are dumber than forrest gump.
---
SC recently posted in twitter that they fixed the welcom pack bug. If ur on android update ur game
---
Well I updated it so it isn't anymore.
---
Well its not the spear goblin but it is based around the dart goblin but it is more like this he will have 3 different types of shots a fire dart a water dart and a earth dart the fire dart will do the most damage around 1400 but will a shorter range then the other darts it will also have a poizen affect it will do more damage then crows but will have only 3 ticks the water dart will do mid damage like 700 but it will slow the enemy and the earth dart will do low damage like 400 but will heal him for around 650 hp he will have around 4300 hp his super will be a combination of all 3 attaks it will slow have poizen do around 1600 damage and it will heal him for around 450 hp his star power will affect is teammates when the poizen is one is teammates will heal when the slow is one he and his teammates will get a movement speed incrise and when he use the earth dart he will heal his teammates as well one last thing the ammo will be fire water and then earth but when you use the fire its gona be water even if the fire one is relouded and when you use the water the next one will be the earth one and so on. Pretty long isn't it lol
---
on the r.i.p should say la momma

mike, mike, mike, mike... guess what day it is!! showdown teaming day!

You can buy him and go to his profile and buy the night witch skin for only 59 gems.
---
This post is one of the best uses I seen for this meme. 10/10!
---
Please supercell, can you solve the problem of the connection issue, im doing good with clash royale or any other games but when it comes to brawl star, the wifi keeps pop in and the lags.... if it keep going like that, sadly i will no longer play it so please Supercell can you do something.
---
Thanks.
---
Also ftp. I also get loot but I don’t post it
---
With honour, I'm Iranian
---
I mean yes but I bet they wanted to UNIFY the Game Modifiers to just SPAWNING stuffs like robots, meteors, and Mushrooms 
---

There’s no point to delaying the opening of a brawl box 
---
The entire team when the Bush starts speaking lvl 50 enemy robot in siege

Why is Jessie in a gold border? Does that mean something special?

Im Sorry but If u want to make a post, DONT USE NIGHT BITCH MORTIS.

The bo is ready to kill you

In solo showdown? Isn't he one of the weakest brawlers in solo mode?
---
I only has piper and darryl from superrarea and epics
---
Damn what’s your %chance for epics, mythics, and legendaries?
---
And can outrange all brawlers 
---
Yeah I stick to the old one too, unless I want to see who I should push more trophies with then I’ll sort by trophies to see :)
---
When it costs almost 3 times as much.
---
He is kinda cure :D
---
Friday the 13th is in September. Get on this SuperCell. 
---
I can buy crow and Leon for less than half the price
---
Why would you want them to get rid of a mode bc you’re bad at it... get good
---
Just asking, what should I do if I lose 120 trophies on siege and not get a star token?
---
excuse me but what the fuck is this
---
Well they don’t do a lot of damage so I wouldn’t recommend this
---
Love to see this in game!!
---
did you get crow
---
Don’t listen to the other comments, you really shouldn’t considering you haven’t upgraded other brawlers that are able to upgrade, don’t waste gold on PowerPoints if you can use the gold to upgrade
---
Ikr!
---
Don’t do it.
---
Damn. Gonna have to contact Supercell then.

my little brother got crow at 900 trophies i am sad

Not enough constant DPS imo. She has burst but reload is soooo slow when a bot is coming at your Ike. Not a lot of early-mid game control either. But to each their own.

Hmm yes
---
Oh em gee I’m so sorry 
---
I’m missing the exact same brawlers as I I’m at 5.5k trophies
---
0,1300% leg chance

I opened 4 mega boxes and got no new brawler

that was a bug

r/woosh

Try and reach 400 first shdnt be tht hard , u will get a new brawler soon gl! 
---
I know, it's just stupid
---
Know what?
---
It's far better than the Night Witch Mortis crossover, I will say that without question. I actually really like these ones you've made.
---
*This is beyond science* 
---
Appreciated. I love the game, but as a high schooler with no job, I don’t have enough to spend  that much on it. Sure, I’d buy the $5 offers here and there, but that’s all I can do. 
---
Just lol
---
Agree, I hate the modifier . 
---
Correct
---
Feels bad
---
I’m at 4K and I have all the specials, all the super specials and all the epics
---
We need to be more specific this time for help get another 0.1 upgrade 
---
But it does affect people who don’t buy it. It creates false value within the community. People pay 30 for a legendary so 10 bucks for a joke skin is worth it right? Even if that’s not the point; why would I pay the same amount for something I enjoy (different skin, etc.) when the company shows it’s willing to make a quick buck on a joke? 
---
I made the same point with an unpopular opinion post on this sub. I said Brock’s new rockets are nice but the copy pasta onto ‘classic Brock’ make them feel less special and worth money. It’s not that they put out a joke skin.. it’s that they put out a *bad* joke skin. 
---
If you change people to consumers your rhetorical question kind of answers itself.

that's not horrible!

Ok now this is legendary 👌

Thx for letting me know that is was hand drawn i could not see it
---
Where? Cus siege is a normal event, and showdown now has either regular or modified every other day
---
It's a bug, no need to be that rude
---
It's a real deal
---
yes ahahah nodbody bought it.

Ouch my bro has 3000~ with everyone except crow and spike... Sorry

How do u make these? See a lot and wonder where blockbimages r from or if it’s a webstsite
---
Huh, I always referred to him as Frunk.
---
I have 2.4k and crow, big oof for u
---
The main issue is the reward system in sd , ppl really fear to die early in high trophies so they camp or team . Sc shd try to take kills in account . I agree teaming is super annoying , but somehow if u dun team it’s impossible to play solo sd. I used to love solo sd but now I mostly play duo sd unless I got a new brawler. 
---
I’ve gotten my Pam to 176 trophies at level one. I haven’t even had her for a week now. I do use Pam in other game modes though 
---
When's the last time you got a new one? About hiw many boxes ago was it do you think?
---
Stop trynna cheat the system 
---
Ok so... Skin is 150 (absurd) and mythic brawler is 270 right? Where tf is the logic there! 
---
Ok I don’t know what the hell was going on when I was typing they but I mean ‘it’s is ‘ not ‘it’s not’. 
---
Poco is not good in Siege. He’s decent at support, but this mode requires damage because damage provides control of the center.
---
It’s-a me Jessie
---
\*panicked breathing
---
Well played ;)
---
Says the guy who makes the pretty much same post as someone else.
---
The longer they leave it, the fewer people complain about other issues with the game as everyone's distracted meming about crow and mortis
---
Supercell is probably just gonna stick with mobile for now.
---
Why do you just have perfect ideas?! Congratulations
---
I like that good job
---
Faker fake fucking fake
---
Really it not a big deal, you almost could do it with any brawler to 100 trophies with 1 level. I push my dinamike and Tara to 100 in heist
---
You are right, thank you! One more question, when buying a brawler with gems, your legendary chance does not drop, correct?
---
Thank you! One more question, when buying a brawler with gems, your legendary chance does not drop, correct?

The canon, omg

uh Barley was definitely not S tier. Dynamike was.

Literally in the S Tier in the pic.
---
Ik I tried to make a batter one but didn't do so well...
---
It was in the previous map btw
---
Even without the boost he is still quick
---
Except now there’s siege 
---
This post speaks truth and 100% facts.  
---
I hate teaming, and it sucks because sometimes there's literally no other way to survive in solo showdown. It gets to the point that if you don't team, you die by teamers. The only time I "team" is to take down a stronger brawler, say, a 10 powercube bull.  
---
This ruins showdown completely, as it's "solo" showdown, and people shouldn't have to team to win in this gamemode. Players should be able to play a solo game mode, without being forced to team with others. But supercell is like "eh, it's part of the game, we're gonna keep it." They haven't done anything to fix it. Meteors don't even work either.  
---
Teaming is a lazy way to progress in the game, and it makes you worse and worse as you progress, and soon, you don't even know proper skills without teaming with other people, and imo, it's laziness. It doesn't make you good, it makes you worse.  
---
As for this post, OP, this is one of the most high-effort posts on this sub. Very accurate, and you speak lots of facts. Wish I could give this post platinum. 10/10.
---
Same but I’m at 5200
---
Credit the original artist smh
---
Could only work for nintendo switch i think
---
Better idea related to chemistry could a Breaking Bad Skin, although this is awesome
---
ahhabagagauahah
---
This man understands me
---
Look it I have crap Brawlers too but I'm at 4000~ and SEIGE lose 8 gain 10 seems legit...
---
Yeah I guess. It mostly depends on who your teammates are. If the enemy consists  of brawlers like penny jessie or bo you can easily dodge their shots so its alot easier.
---
nowhere as quick though.
---
I like it, but no could just mine the middle and people would camp the jump pad landing locations
---
Best thing I seen all day
---
What I mean is that this play is still possible without it
---
Yep save them up. They aren't preselected rewards so if you are waiting for a new brawler it's fine to hold off opening them.
---
And the effect of the basic attack
---
I don't have crow yet, I have to downvote, forgive me please
---
I wonder how much it actually costs supercell to design skins etc. Probably a lot less than what these prices are, even if it is a bug
---
She's teaming with 2 other pams every time I see her though...
---
You can repeatedly smash your face into your phone and reach Rank 9
---
You are forgiven, no regrets

Having crow and admitting he’s strong
---
The enemy team didn't get one seige robot.

u/ramondaboss
---
Should I say No?
---
Similar situation except I have frank. We are just so unlucky.
---
Perfect
---
Hmm?
---
Yeah maybe 
---
😁
---
Maybe they should have it one hour on, on hour off. Then it keeps it fresh and keeps up player numbers
---
Oh yes, exactly 213.98€ so 267.47$ ^^
---
I don't think so. Leon covered so much extra terrain with that super.
---
You will regret it
---
I was undecided, but everything is a military theme I did not see it
---
Ohh I see. I said Barely
---
The map looks lit but I do think see a point on the left and right springs, you would fall in the water. Instead make them looking to mid or diagonal in the same direction they actually are.
---
Kkkk vlw
---
Cute
---
Kairos, Coach Corey and Lex have done an excellent job breaking down the new game mode and making preliminary tier lists.
---
Good job!
---
Herobrine
---
Looks lit
---
Nah
---
Why the hell does Leon need a buff?
---
Dont play with randoms, especially in a mode with double trophies. Play it with friends with a good comp, or lose trophies with randoms jumping in springtraps and suiciding all game

But it 😶

Don’t listen to everyone telling you he sucks. He’s very good but if you can use him correctly.

Except that this isn't a sudden problem. This has always been a problem and is surprisingly more prevalent as you climb in trophies. How can players possibly be getting worse as you climb in trophies? That makes no logical sense. And you can tell if they know what they're doing or not. You can tell when players use brawlers that are ill suited to the map or mode that they don't know what they're doing. Or when they use brawlers that are ill suited to specific roles. Seasoned players know that, in gem grab for instance (generally speaking) you have a Gem Carrier, an Aggro and a Support. That the Gem Carrier takes center lane, aggro takes left and support takes right. That control is integral to winning, not killing opponents, that aggro brawlers don't carry gems cause it's too high risk and to protect your gem carrier. They know not to fall back until you have at least 2 more gems than you opponents and so on.
---
If you pay attention you can tell which players know what's up, and which ones don't. It's not difficult.

It's Donald Trump

Wait, whaaa I thought he always was one

Could I replace the bushes with obstacles or something?

I'll post when I finished the map.

At first, it not a bug, it a feature. Secondly, there are more strategy like Clash Royale.  Do you overwhelmed them with robot or chip away the safe.  Tank and high damage is dominated the game right now so have this option is better for the game.

Let's see if you keep the skin

I agree, like when your teammate passes you the ball when you next to the goal and the enemy is about spawn, or when you have a good team comp with randoms and one of them only pick up. I know it isn't a sudden problem for randoms at updates, but i just mentioned it since was losing many trophies after the update just released, seeing many bulls and el primo is showdown
---
Teaming is for cowards. Plain and simple. Can't hack it? Team. Really should be their motto.

Clear theme looks good

Hidden Danger? I love the map!
---
Did you?

Finally upvite worthy comment/s
---
Exactly. But if you do not team you will just end up losing trophies over trophies. Sadly that's the game, we can't really do anything about it, neither can the developers.
---
I feel although this is an obvious solution, perhaps there should be a clear signal, like a red arrow pointing at your IKE...
---
It’s way too easy to just sneak and go unnoticed, especially when your keeping the enemies busy on the frontlines.
---
One buff to the IKE could be increasing it’s radius by 1 tile, or perhaps making the radius more oval-shaped at the sides, to prevent a sneaky turret getting through m.
---
Would you rather be an ugly legendary or a ultra sexy CREATURE OF THE NIGHT 
---
Thats a bug, the "0" is to much there cuz my friend has the aame thing but its only 299 gems
---
I haven’t got a brawler in over a month and got Pam and Frank back to back boxes... So much for my legendary...
---
I know it's a bug
---
Before I post a skin concept I look to see if anyone else had the same idea. Although I didn’t see his post.., he was the first one to post a “baseball frank” so a lil credit to u/alfe01

How does this have to do with Bloons?

Who said Leon was bad in bb?  *thonkface*

Even parody works. El Primo Del 13th. 
---
ur blind colt would have went the same speed as him
---
That's incredibly nieve. Yes they can. They just haven't yet. 
---
They said when the subject was first broached that they were fine with teaming as long as it's not the only way to win. 
---
Now you're saying its the only way to win. So you just prove that the worst of all possible scenarios has occurred and that teamers have actually, officially ruined Showdown. Thank you.
