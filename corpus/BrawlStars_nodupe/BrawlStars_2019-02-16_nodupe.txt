That‚Äôs me! The One
---
I‚Äôm happy that I got my gene so I have no problem with supercell as it is right now. As I was saying goodluck my dude.
---
Sweet :) time to get crackin' on me crates!
---
Brock is Good. But Leon is really good too. More versatile than Gene
---
What type of end game content would you like to see?
---
The matchmaking is a shit when you have low trophies brawlers
---
Also shoutout to DRK for being able to deal with high level players even though he‚Äôs only 7k
---
I opened 7 boxes and i got 7 gems as compensation 
---
I opened 70 brawl boxes and 7 big boxes and got 2 gems
---
Thank you all for the votes. I stayed up until 2am Chicago time to capture it üëç I feel like less of a fool
---
I know

how can u tell?

This is actually a good idea! She'd shoot seeds tho

Thanks man!

---
I might be slighted by this (and all the other garbage Supercell imposes on their community), but it isn't lost on me that I'm the voice of many.  At least you escaped Supercell's sodomy campaign.
---
Relatable
---
That‚Äôs crazy, I‚Äôm still pretty new like I started playing when it first released in the us im at around 1470 cups and have yet to get a legendary
---
They got to cocky lmao 
---
Because getting something for nothing makes no sense. We all had to wait a couple weeks from the brawl talk to get gene, so what‚Äôs a couple more hours? Players who opened boxes are getting compensated because they actually lost something, you or anyone who waited didn‚Äôt and still had all of your boxes left to get gene.
---
For a second, I was happy about this because I thought Supercell was going to give me back all the boxes I had opened - 70ish brawl boxes and 7 big boxes. Instead, I only got 2 or 3 gems. Thanks, Supercell.

Ya I didn‚Äôt mean to type that much at first. It can be translated by screen shot or camera on a smartphone though. Thats how I translate anything 
---
Haha thanks
---
I feel bad for you, I got the gene after I just opened 54 normal boxes and a big box.
---
Thx and I wasted the 30 gems like an idiot without realizing if I spent them it'd be and extra 1.99 to afford gene so looks like I'm not doing that anymore
---
Lucifer gene
---
Let's make it a petition
---
I'm simply suggesting my opinion, no need to bring out your 10 year old self. As a level 5 rank 19 Mortis, I feel like hes very underwhelming rn
---
No worries.  The drop rates are painfully low.  However, when you step back and look at the broader public image Supercell has created for themselves, you will see that they are no longer of a culture that is in this to design quality games and provide a top-tier user experience.  Supercell has sold out.  They are making their decisions based solely on the bottom line....$$$.  
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I guess over 2Billion Euros in yearly revenue and only 215 or so employees doesn't generate a high enough profit margin for these money-grubbers.
---
Mortis is one of the best brawlers right now he's top 10 #6
---
This post was approved by the Crow Gang
---
ITS REWIND TIME
---
I really do enjoy the increase on attack, but I just feel like he is just very underwhelming as a character. 
---
Nice :)
---
Thanks! I hate it.

A good homage to the brawl stars japanese community

Is it a friend u know from irl or ingame? If from ingame he probably trying to scam you
---
wait, so what if coincidentally you had saved up some big and brawl boxes and you opened them all in expectation of gene before knowing that gene was yote from the game? is it possible to rewind and get the brawl and big boxes back? I unlocked pam btw.
---
literally 1 gem
---
Yeah I guess I should.
---
was about to say that
---
Bad use of this meme 
---
just saying, the heist meta has now changed. by removing the majority of the walls on some of the map and around the safe, bull, el primo and throwers are no longer meta on every map, as there arent enough walls for them to use as their advantage (in my opinion primo was never meta :P) brawlers such as brock, pam, colt  can really excel, and with the introduction of medium ranged brawlers, darryl can also do really well in heist.
---
there are still maps with walls, and tanks are still good. ijust feel like the current meta is new diverse, with the introduction of extra lanes, unique map design and more.
---
I opened 80 brawl boxes, 7 big boxes, 1 mega box; got 16 gems *yay*
---
goodbye
---
I‚Äôm beta player and my luck hasn‚Äôt even started .. lmao 
---
Yeah i got the same at my 10k mega but i got 3 tichets andd    3 gems
---
noice!
---
People got higher in the old boss fight showdown where bosses dropped 5 and charged your super. I got 54 in solo if I had a teammate he could have sacrificed and picked up half of them to get to 81
---
How dare u! Mortis gang rise up!
---
I personally like it. Great map for throwers and snipers and actually makes primo and bull viable in bounty if you are able to use cover well.
---
Not the bats!
---
that‚Äôs not very cash money if you 
---
I'm pretty sure Gene's super is for securing a kill rather than grabbing a full HP brawler, even if its a squishy...
---
Salty post. Get over it
---
I got penny lol. I should have expected that to happen 
---
That would defeat the purpose of leveling your brawlers üôÑ

Any tips for him?

Or you could just download an auto clicker üëÄ

It actually can

So it wouldn‚Äôt have a regular attack until it shifts into a brawler?

Apple is aware of whats going on and issuing refunds instantly and they do not report account names to supercell
---
Np lol
---
The DOOT zone, maybe? 
---
I don‚Äôt like it cause it sucks for my go to piper. Buff crow though.
---
a little bit
---
see what happens is people go in with a thrower thinking they'll have a fat advantage
---
but a smart cookie chooses mortis and claps everyone
---
I dont have mortis so i cant be that smart cookie
---
I'm an OB (original brawler)
---
So you‚Äôre normal. 
---
Nice!
---
Definitely won‚Äôt ever be good
---
[removed]
---
I actually, think yes Brawl Stars should but it would be unfair for other people cause if they are not the original creator of the skin, they will never get it, unless you buy it and the original creator thinks it will be fair. But, some original creators think it's unfair they want the skin free.
---
Just tried it works perfect

It could be

Then just join the mortis gang for a proven 100% skill increase
---
This happens once every 1000 match, seriously not an issue.
---
If they buff it, sure. As of now it‚Äôs horrible. Seems like a lot of people are defending it when I‚Äôm pretty sure none of them have it unlocked.
---
Huh....
---
A meme i have started

*P R I M K*

It really doesn't

Literally all day I‚Äôve been fighting level 7-10 genes

crap, I don‚Äôt have a brawl stars pun. I need a Spike of imagination to get me going
---
Well yah, but saying it is completely useless is dumb
---
It's really good! I would totally buy it...well, if I had Leon.
---
Tara has the same, her cape goes through her arm.
---
No problem it‚Äôs in our GENEs to do so
---
I guess but you shouldn't have to be out leveled like a mf. I have a friend who just got the game playing against the same shit.
---
YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
---
I think it is a great way to use a machine to help you tap the Brawl Box button, it will also save you sometime you can like eat something, do something else on the computer or do some sports activities. Your finger muscles won't get tired.
---
That is an exception since people who have other brawlers maxed out have saved boxes and receive pp's exclusively for Gene, and the matchmaking is based on trophies. This is seriously not an issue.

The William Osman of Brawl Stars, using a jacksaw motor and a stylus to open boxes, brilliant.
---
Okay, this is epic.
---
Haha love that!
---
im going to hell for laughing
---
Photoshop, each map contains 20 boxes thats 2 per guy that means they drop one and if nobody got killed that 29 for you bc all 9 deaths because even if u don't have a box the guy u kill drops a cube anyway and all 20 boxes to you makes it 29. Good joke bad photoshop. Sorry if it sounds like im hating i mean no beef don't mean to be an ass but ye know :/

I got nothing just because I have Tara locked yet...

Just wondering as I had a similar experience today, has anyone else received a "Donation from Brawl Stars support" of 32 gems? I logged in this evening and received the pop-up in the image above with that message. My guess is that I got it because I bought the Colt skin before the remodel, thinking it would basically give me a discount when the skin changed, but it ended up being for ricochet instead. A pleasant surprise nonetheless!

I got this too and got 3 gems out of it. I did literally nothing for it. I didn‚Äôt save up boxes for Gene or anything, didn‚Äôt care for him because I‚Äôm not a hardcore player. Didn‚Äôt participate in the map thing either. Very confused. I came here to see if anyone else had this as well and you‚Äôre the first person that did. 
---
I bought Gene but after I got my first win with him I opened a box to get Mortis
---
ok
---
She borders on a high to top tier pick with a competent team. If you have a tank and a DPS, she's a must-have and can turn the game around with the right placement on her mortars
---
i know that
---
Very odd
---
Everyone would just play bull, also people would go back to teaming. I was thinking more like making multiple full rotations would deal damage to your character
---
They give you gems for the boxes you opened when gene was removed

Showdown doesn‚Äôt take skill. Ask any top player. It‚Äôs mainly based on cheap tactics and rng 
---
Did you just unlock him? It just seemed odd to me as most of my brawler are level 5 plus and I only started in dec. But your trophies are way beyond mine. So I thought you would have been playing way longer.
---
A report button as well as the ability to send replays to supercell.
---
I know its not that skilled but its hard to survive in SD specially if you take it as a challenge. 
---
I love ur honesty man!
---
Ik ppl who push past 14K trophies from only solo showdown. If u ever face them in 3v3, they get absolutely destroyed
---
Dude its the exact same thing on both sides. Its ass, but it‚Äôs still balanced
---
recently i was #1 without teaming and just with 2 energies
---
It is a glitch in friendly mode. If at least one person isnt ready, you can press the ready button and the brawler button at the same time and then choose the same brawler your teammates are using

But that's so true. Pam can deal more dos than poco and at longer range

I got 4 gems but I wasn‚Äôt even online when they started maintenance 
---
You both are blessed people
---
Supercell, I opened a few boxes during that time and I have not been conpensated, plz can you
---
It would defeat the purpose of Gene though. From playing him, I have concluded that Gene is a character who you have to play quite carefully. Having one less ammo can mean life or death. Pulling in the wrong enemies can also mean death. Having an escape move would significantly lower the risk of making mistakes. 
---
How many boxes did you open? That's not even enough for a mega box
---
I got 4 but I didn‚Äôt open any

I was really hoping to get gene

Ahahaha so you can photoshop next time? Sure I will explain: Do you see the right bottom corner....? Where you should have a little box with a number indicating the remaining items of your box...? You don't have that, that happens when you by a brawler ;)
---
is this a joke or dont you know about bulls starpower
---
That's epic 
---
1% chance so it should only take 100 boxes to get 1 at least. Dunno why its taking so long
---
See... It's frustrating. Deng near 500 on a few Brawlers and they aren't even close to fully leveled. It's not fun to play with them so under leveled...

Nothing is wrong with thiccochet

its common in low trophy matches

How do you defeat, the one which has... No life? 
---
That is really nice idea that you need to charge your super or use dynamike's starpower to get those boxes in the mid
---
By not saying where a Gene is 
---
That's a shorter one. He can reach the other end of the wall if he bounces properly.
---
He can also get stuck on the water until he gets killed by the storm, but that rarely happens.
---
I somehow got 28 
---
Yeah that was my intention.Staying mid is risky and if the middle walls get opened, war will start.
---
Yea I guess youre right

60 boxes isn‚Äôt a lot dude.

The reason ones with another mythic to be unlocked weren‚Äôt compensated is because if they didn‚Äôt unlock Tara/Mortis in those boxes, then they wouldn‚Äôt have unlocked gene either, had he been in the game

what players see: unfair+annoying                                             what Supercell see: dynamic makes the gameplay more cooler so we should remove the life leech cuz there is so   teaming

Many people are in the same boat as you and trusted Supercell.  Unfortunately, Supercell has chosen to compensate a small, targeted portion for the disaster they cause.  Interestingly, it seems like the players that Supercell reimbursed are mostly made up of the players that have paid them money in the past.  Don't worry though, even those players got screwed...Supercell seems to have chosen to reimburse them with only a fraction of the value of the boxes they wasted, so they got screwed, too; just a little less than the rest of us.
---
It seems like Supercell only issued any reimbursement for anyone as a marketing stunt since they got bad press on this.  The way Supercell handled their screw up here suggests they may have tried to sweep this under the rug, but failed.
---
Supercell really screwed their community on this.
---
I have all the cards except for Gene, which is now available to purchase from the store at a discount and yet, there is an offer to purchase a card for 350 gems from the store in a different offer as well. Something must be done about these mechanics put in place SuperCell, it just makes no sense.

Ew light mode

Yeah ik
---
The term ‚Äúbig boss‚Äù shouldn‚Äôt be describing a character and a mini boss. Anyone who can summon things shouldn‚Äôt be playable. It‚Äôs an easy fix. All you see in big game currently is Nita and Jessie.
---
You need to put on your mind that you dont need to kill the other players, only annoy them...hit, heal up, hit, heal up, gain some time and waste theirs.. always on max range and be safe all the time
---
But I‚Äôm pretty sure they would have to nerf the health for the big brawler all in all
---
You can still be the star player even if you lost?
---
Don't have to.
---
Oh how mistakenly wrong you are.
---
That made a huge difference supercell
---
but it takes forever to use it
---
I wouldn't expect this...Supercell's behavior in this matter suggests that they don't care much about the members of their community.  They clearly have agreed that they screwed a lot of their players hear and have chosen to leave many of those players high and dry.  Interestingly the small portion of their playerbase that they did choose to reimburse seems to be mostly made up of players that had paid them money in the past.
---
Increasing drop rates to more appropriate chances would probably just cut into their massive bank accounts more than they are comfortable with.  It's a shame that Supercell care's so little for the members of their community.

The focus is not the safe..the focus is to push the other team to they safe..always annoying, focusing on waste their time and not to kill
---
That would not be fair at all. Like i said, they can nerf the spawnables health to like +20% hp rather than +300% so it can be reasonably taken out. Otherwise they wouldn‚Äôt have a use.

Your most likely going to have to contact support

When I looked at my Brawler list afterwards he wasn't there. Would be bad luck if he got removed during the last chest, idk

Tell me on which showdown map and heist map u played it pls and thnx for the tips.
---
GG if hit
---
Man, back when the game actually had good and easy to understand controls. Nearly a year since landscape and I am still getting mixed up on the controls. smh devs.
---
Morris is strong rn. Leon is also pretty under control. The auto attack against teaming would be bad because a piper might want to snipe someone 9 times away while running from a brawler who is 6 tiles away, wasting a valuable piper shot
---
You can, you just won‚Äôt be able to claim anything after them until you claim the points
---
Okay.
---
That sounds like a good idea, just keep in mind Barley is fragile, so you want to avoid being right up in the battle. Staying behind some walls is best.
---
Barley is best in Heist, so try him in there sometime. He definitely isnt best for Showdown, Big Game and other modes like that

You are disgusting. You are such a problem, COMPLAINING about NOT GETTING BOSS as JESSIE. Jessie needs a nerf on boss fight. Glad you didnt get boss

ik i saw that and was like ‚Äúwtf?????‚Äù

He is so damn powerful even when lvl six so it doesn't make sense to complain about him while lvl 8, and just FYI poco has the best range in the game
---
Oof fuck ...that was..... deliciously satisfying

R.i.p Shelly the only Shelly in Jessie's match party.

I mean, you are all level 10,  even if they had 3000 trophies it wouldn't change anything

Like everyone said, hes nothing without his bois lol

He is salty, but he's right. They had literal weeks to do something as simple as decreasing the turret's and the bear's hp. I get that they are busy with other stuff and they're a small team, but even though I'm no programming expert, I don't think it'll take more than an hour or so to do that.

[Idea] Change Leon's name to Green Nita
---
So easy a caveman can do it... Save money now, by switching to Geico! 
---
I still get you w/my eyes closed though
---
Really nice work, keep dis up!
---
^^ they don‚Äôt although it would really be a help because everyone‚Äôs complaining about Jessie and Nita dominating
---
That‚Äôs why I used this format
---
When it comes to probability, we unfortunately can‚Äôt just take the sum of the events. In other words, if a star power (let‚Äôs use this example since it‚Äôs a nice number)  has a 1% chance, we can‚Äôt guarantee a star power in 100 boxes (100‚Ä¢1%=100% guarantee) because each box is independent of the other 99 boxes. 
---
So you take the probability of the event **not** happening (99% or 0.99) and multiply it by itself each time that you will try your luck. So if you have two boxes, you have 0.99‚Ä¢0.99=98.01% chance of not receiving the star power (a 1.99% chance of getting a star power). Every time you try your luck, you multiple yet again times the chance of the event not happening. Now, remember that you can use an exponent to simplify the math of 0.99‚Ä¢0.99‚Ä¢...‚Ä¢0.99 to be 0.99^n where n is the *n*umber of boxes that you have. 
---
Quick note: the special boxes have 3x and 10x draws, so if you have a mega box and 90 regular boxes, you have the equivalent of n=100 boxes.
---
So, if I have 85 regular boxes, and 5 special boxes with 3x reward, I have 100 boxes. My chances of **not** getting a mythic are 0.9975^100 = 0.779 (which means I have a 1 - 0.779 = 22.1% chance of receiving Gene).
---

Umm. Well. I wanted Gene but not so hard. :/
---
I  use my gems on skins as a f2p.  It looks cool.  Plus I already have most of my 14 brawlers level 7. So boxes will do nothing except increase chance to get my first epic, mythic, or legendary.
---
More content coming soon!
---
Not a fix, your connection just wasn't any good so you probably missed a hit.
---
Supercell wants you to spend your gems on Gene.  That's why they took advantage of the disaster they created yesterday when they caused their community to waste their Brawl Boxes while Supercell had quietly removed Gene from the game and then chose to give the smallest portion of the players they screwed the least amount of gems possible...it was just a marketing stunt because they weren't able to sweep it under the rug fast enough like they tried.  So, if you ask Supercell, spend your gems because it pads their fat bank accounts.
---
I believe only Legendary drops (or them not dropping) changes your Legendary chances.  Mythic drops don't.
---
Tip when Mortis about to dash towards you running, as Mike, toss the dynamite right in front, and then quickly run horizontally. Easy Mortis kill.
---
Anyone actually, if you time it right, run the right or left, real quick after a dash. Don't keep running straight line front or back. 
---
Some Mortis will not really expect it, and you can see them fail

Yes ! And i got enough gems with This 175 to buy him directly !
---
Then it was just bad luck - they gave 1 gem to everyone who opened 0 boxes during the time gene was no available
---
Hows that even possible if theres no respawns? 
---
What was the donation?
---
in nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off hell in a cell...
---
I need this in my life
---
They gave gems according to the amount  of boxes u opened 
---
I don't understand y ppl choose brawlers that are only good if you are the big brawler... On average you will get significantly less points and will also screw your teammates
---
What‚Äôs the point of blocking
---
HAHAHA....Supercell screwed you, too.  Many people got no compensation like Supercell said they would.  But, getting 1 gem for all the Boxes you wasted when trusting Supercell is more of a slap in the face than getting no gems.
---
Still haven't received compensation for my 100 boxes...

All that work to save boxes and open them when there was a 0% chance at unlocking Gene.

Colt's super is useful but unoriginal and unnecessary. They should have made something more unique...
---
No it doesn‚Äôt people have done the math it really doesn‚Äôt take that long in 4 weeks you get 48 boxes from keys, 11 big boxes from Star keys, and 2 season rewards plus free stuff in the shop. Also you get 40 keys a day from events so 11 more boxes totaling 92 without season rewards or free stuff so you can easily get over 100 in 4 weeks. That‚Äôs about 1.3 brawlers worth of stuff plus a star power because they have a 1 in a 100 chance of dropping. With that math you could max out within a year and a half for all 23 brawlers if you play super consistently 
---
Oh boy I hope this is the weirdest way a show can get sponsored, tbh they actually tried to be unique.

Now it makes sense why the chances of winning a new brawler are incredibly low (1% super rare 0.5% epic 0.2%myTICCs brawlers)it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs an easy way to win money with offers.I never liked that the chances of you winning a new caracter are under 5% in every box.You can open 100 boxes and if you don‚Äôt get nothing it‚Äôs ‚Äúnormal‚ÄùWTF.I know a lot of f2p have all brawlers maxed out but it really depends how long it takes.

He opened his boxes accidentally while Gene was disabled. People who got 1-5 gems were aware that gene WAS disabled so this guy got more
---
wish i could watched this. idk how tho. 
---
You put a news flair... I don‚Äôt think you knew
---
Video link of them playing, anyone? 
---
Personally would open the chests whenever I get em unless I wanna save them for something coming up. The chances are the same, and the sooner I have my hands on a new brawler, the sooner I can make progress with him!

I opened 2 normal and 1 big box after Gene was disabled, and I got 5 gems. I think they give 1 gem for every box.
---
Well if you have Nita‚Äôs star power thier you go but that would make them too op and then games could last long amounts of time and they would heal too much 
---
el taramortisprimodynamikecolt

Yeah... I opened like 120 boxes..

It is because everyone crushed on gene's super, so player could became nervous.

You can shoot straight through the entrance to the other side, praying for the 2k damage. Gives you a big fight advantage. Honestly, as long as she doesnt go inside the box I guess shs'll be fine. Its not her worst map.

I thought Leon was weird as hell cuz his bullets are red when you play against him. I thought he threw raw spinning meat.

Choose the absolute worst brawler to be as The Big Brawler and you will more than likely be it.

Choose Penny, Darryl or Mortis and I am sure you will be The Big Brawler.

Because since you were aware that Gene was disabled, you technically don‚Äôt deserve that much gems for something you later knew.

Bro with the 5.49‚Ç¨ and 2.29‚Ç¨ (110 gems) i will go to 254 gems. I alredy have open 65 mini boxes and 9 bigs and i didn't get anything. I'm at 3640 and for the moment i don't have epics, legendaries and mythics (only Mortis) so yes, my lucky is pretty bad (14/23 with level 65)!
---

Dou you know that safety first is a Belgium serie from televison? Good map.

Then you check your friends profile:

ATTENTION! This guy seems very upset that he just lost a game.
---
If you play for fun, you should not chase trophies
---
At least you did't open 100+ Brawl Boxes and didn't get a single brawler like me. I only got like 25 gems.
---
Then it shows 4K and it‚Äôs papa smurf
---
Nothing personal, kid. *sticks a fork in you*
---
You guys are getting gems? 
---
Never happened to me
---
That situation happens more often if you replay with after a win. IMO, all teams should have an equal start. The cube and team placements sometimes foreshadow 1st or last place. 
---
how do i claim this?

Could be possible to have a CSGO type of overwatch system. Allow experienced players who have a certain amount played review matches. Three reportable offenses could be Throwing, AFK, Foul Name. These matches would be saved and go into a system of review that players could look at. If enough people say he threw then he will be banned. 
---
Or you know, don't use tanks on big game
---
And gene got vaulted because he is a bug
---
Instructions unclear, opened 50 boxes while disabled and got 1 gem.

---
I‚Äôm ftp and I have 20/23 brawlers. all except the legendaries, I think it‚Äôs pretty ok as it is
---
Oh right it is, but pinging is also a way to communicate with your team using in-game "popups" in a way
---
First thing: DONT "MAIN" A BRAWLER. You MUST play ALL your brawlers, don't push too hard with one of them. When you do that, you will be fighting people in a higher people, so people with more trophies, more brawlers at high levels, and more experience.
---
Most brawlers are balanced, rn in this meta, Darryl is pretty good and even a little OP. Brawlers like Bull, Shelly, Primo, Frank and some more are map and gamemode dependant, but they are also good. 
---
You should check for the tier list of Kairos in YouTube. It will tell you which brawlers are good or bad in every mode.
---
Also, learn to aim and not always use autoaim, aa many brawlers are better when you aim your shots
---
Tell me if you need help!

However, he has a good DPS :(

Yes i did and I'm not talking about current main menu music

how long have u been playing? since Dec. launch or way before? because if Dec. launch, that's when I started playing &amp; i have 15/23. so if we both started on launch, how is it that u have 5 more brawlers than me. i have 2,049 3v3 wins so I play a lot. i have no mythics, legendaries &amp; 1 epic which is piper &amp; she's the worst so in a sense i didnt get an epic.
---
Lol darryl isnt op...but if you have his star power then is op
---
It's rewind time
---
Uh so is it okay if dynamikes team without spinning?
---
This is talking about menu music, ain't talking about battle music. 
---
wasnt MORTIS remolded? 
---
Um... any concept you‚Äôve made?
---
TLDR: He is OP as balancing is made according to max stats with Star Power.

Barley had to do it to em

I really don't know what kind of response you were expecting. Did you want something like, Use your super 9 times in a game, spin around 4009 times, and spend $2000 on gems to get power points faster? 
---
No, you either keeo opening boxes to get them, buy them from the shop, or a combination of both.
---
yeah I tend to have a problem with Piper's ult and going where I want to... I play on phone though so maybe I should get a tablet or something

There's a reason there's no report button, because this game is also full of raging 10 year olds. I think it should be auto-report (for BB at least) where games are reviewed if a player scores on their own goal.

Mortis went sicko mode 
---
It's in Portuguese 
---
I kinda agree with you for gem grabs
---
  
---
Actually it's a mode i don't really like because of the poor possibilities. I mean, you can take all the gems during the whole game, and in the last one your whole team die. Opponents take all the gems and it's over, you can't get back becaude they're all back in their base
---
I‚Äôm perfectly fine with teaming as long as you don‚Äôt group up, agree not to attack each other, don‚Äôt agree to 2v1 someone

I have SO many uses for this. Holy Jesus.

Aren‚Äôt you that trap that‚Äôs too active in the reddit discord?

Generally unless it's a low IQ Bull, Frank, or Primo player, I let them live

Then everyone would be Frank, because you could just back to back super the boss repeatedly with multiple Franks.

Why would you name yourself that

Ah no worries, time length isn't an issue. It's pretty fun making concept ideas anyways so it's doesn't bother me. Time-wise though it wasn't like I spent a crazy amount of time on it, it was fairly easy
