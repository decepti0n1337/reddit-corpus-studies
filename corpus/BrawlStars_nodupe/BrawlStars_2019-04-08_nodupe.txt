Bull and shelly would be way too strong, you would need a way to solve that
---
---
---
How?
---
His name should have been Raymond.
---
K.....dont care
---
Although I'm not really good at drawing I wanted to try making a Brawl Stars character
---

---
Tanuki can transform into the last enemy he hits and replicate their abilities, without having access to their Super and a weaker attack value.
---
Don't refrain to give me suggestions on balancing his skillet :)
---
Her mouth is covered
---
Yes u guys are right well done
---
uhhh why are there no tanky-legendary brawlers, all legendary brawlers get sneezed on and die. also by green circle do you mean like poison and how long would it last for
---
I mean his super makes him supposed to be used like bull 
---
imagine a Boss Robot Brock
---
#THANKS 
---
Damn that Piper is a beast
---
She is very weak and has one of the lowest ranges in the game. She gets outranged by eighty percent of the brawlers and therefore cannot charge her super very well. She needs a better way to deal damage and to be useful. So she needs a range buff si she can actually hit people.
---
I just give Tara some love, it's like nobody remembers her.
---
shut r/crowgang
---
So.... lumpy.
---
 #header1 I love it
---
the circle is to recognize the last enemy you've hitter
---
I wanted to give him a unique skillset, and considering he will copy other characters while retaining his max HP, making him tanky is too broken
---
primo definitely means prime or #1 not the cousin 
---
I didn't sync it to a supercell ID and I don't think I synced it to a Google play, because I connected my google play to the app with my new phone and it still didn't show up. 
---
Yes! That‚Äôs typically want everybody wants. A ranged bull but with other tools
---
Nah, not really. She has one of the highest usage rates in lower trophies where there are people who are less experienced and she has the lowest usage rate in higher trophies with more skilled players. So we want to make it so that she is good on both trophy ranges.
---
He‚Äôs not the Bo, he‚Äôs the rank 1 Carl
---
bull's homeland 
---
Meh. I've seen people losing hundreds.
---
Y'all gotta stop fighting Pam like she is piper

Those are the worst cards. Give her some +4.

She can team only with another Phoebe, cause they will nullify their star power haha
---
spike : I don't feel so good 
---
that would be OP
---
Please elaborate ??
---
Lol i did the same
---
Blessed image?
---
That is not satisfying, they are freakin bots
---
It's better to get a power cube and charge your super than to just get a power cube. Forgot to add this, but it also takes another brawler out early, making it less likely for you to lose trophies.
---
Welcome to my schoooolhouuuse
---
Our luck...

UwU really nice job
---
Lol im in...well not really but i have leon uwu
---
Youre so freaking talented.
---
**Holy crap I'm scared shitless**
---
Yes I agree yet that‚Äôs not the case in this video... many chances does a bull get to close in on another brawler while standing next to a box. There‚Äôs a couple brawlers that seemed to be bot like. 
---
Bear withness my thiccness
---
And that‚Äôs a fact.

I agree with this. They could make the dropchance of star power scale per power level(so if you have a power 3 colt, you have a 0.3% chance of getting star power and the star power effect would also scale with level( only 3/10 the strength)
---
This, this is basically a map

Probaly becuase where I live it's 3 in the morning and I just burst out laughing lmao

Yo thx ‚ù§Ô∏è

An app does this. Search for Brawl Stats

have you heard of either people who sell dead flowers or people who sell foowers right next to the local city graveyard
---
Crows good but I'd say he could use a little bit more health...
---
Dynamike is public enemy number #1. Yu wuld have to be stupid to play him. Every showdown dynamikes are either bullied or they are the bully. Its a harsh world that we brawl in

Most people play him has anti teamer... We cannot change every brawl stars player who has mortis...

Sorry, that‚Äôs not him. Apologies in advance for the following paragraph.

For starters, Orange Juice‚Äôs IGN is ‚ÄúOJ‚Äù.

Second of all, Orange Juice‚Äôs Brock is at power level 10. A power level 10 Brock with 1 power cube would have 4320 health, not 3520 health.

true, they 4 tap each other.

Thank u :)

Ive been getting bullied by spikes lately :(
---
I can see this as being a new trending meme template
---
They don‚Äôt really have any known measures of detecting this. I think Supercell just says that they ban account sharing just to scare a majority of people but never actually enforce it.

That's me every time I play with randoms 
---
Happy cake day!
---
I feel like messing with his damage would be difficult to balance. Too much and he becomes overpowered. A new star power would be really nice though. His current one isn't very strong.
---
U got more upvotes for stepping on it lmao
---
Make a Florist Mortis skin
---
Sry I speak french more than English 
---
Pre-order changed to "pioneer" 
---
This would actually be really comical:
---
Spike: &lt;Super&gt;
---
Spike: &lt;Decapitated&gt;
---
If this could make it into the game, I'd actually be so happy
---
Why isnt he being damaged then?
---
Wowowowow
---
20 dynamike would just be waiting to team
---
Or change up the meta, that would be interesting

Yaaa so cool

Id love to see a buff to Nita coz she's my favorite brawler. But I'd honestly be happy if she doesn't get nerfed lol.

X to doubt

I feel as if siege should be a bigger map and a 5v5 cuz if i‚Äôm losing 10 trophies or gaining 8, it better be big
---
That‚Äôs hot
---
and yet i know so many players around 1k with their legendary  , zad
---
Make his super the opposite of Tara's, it can blast opponents outwards of a given spot. Good isolating tool.
---
For me, the orange part covers 99% of the pie chart and the other 1 % is 'everything else'
---
I feel like Siege is easy trophies, it just takes so long and it's so frustrating when you lose

Every mix between two brawlers is a goddamn nightmare  xD

Lol wut

I just assumed because it's the most popular tourist destination to Hawaii (where I'm from)
---
How? He shoots daggers from the beginning of the jump and the landing. He can escape with it, jump to an enemy with it or jump straight up and down so both bursts hit. Bull is nowhere near as versatile. Bull can charge in for damage or run away. That's it. It leaves him wide open to attack and is easily avoidable. I hardly use Bull's super unless I get cornered or to dive in siege.
---
I honestly don't see how people feel like they are the same.
---
This ain‚Äôt my first creature of the night.
---
Carl is so useless without his star power,  even a shelly with zero powercubes can outdo him.  Oh anybody  basically lol
---
Like I said if I had an Ipad It would look different and better. I used an Iphone and those cheap stylus that some ballpoint pens have lmao 
---
Thanks üôèüèΩ 
---
Oh lol makes sense. My hotel was a block away from the beach. Probably one of my favourite childhood memories was that trip. We were a large group so it was cheaper to get a limo than multiple taxis. 9 year old me soaked up everything he could, including some random facts like pineapple breeding.

Only a few manage to survive the sight of the mortis and decide to yell "WhO wAnTs SoMe TnT" to protect himself.

She has the biggest range for a shotgunner.. plus once she has her super is pretty much: super-auto-super-auto so seems fine to me

The Supercell servers are already having a hard time processing Brawl Stars give them a 50 person showdown and their servers will melt.

They might announce 2 but drop one now and the other one next month so they don‚Äôt have to release an update next month.

Also double the star token reward or I‚Äôd rather just not bother myself playing.

I dont have crow XD
---
 The fact that a shelly can use her super, shoot once and have her super again is ridiculous for any brawler.

Its not a taunt if  ennemie or allies can't see it..

At your trophy level, estimating by the amount of time played as said in your post, here is one great solid tip for you

Don't trust randoms, just play some solo until you get to at least 500. The random players down there are complete trash

It should be updated to 8k

Lol

I don know
---
Lame joke and unoriginal man.You saw that other people got a lot of likes so u tried it.Its pathetic man
---
Im not sure. Its just a theory of mine. But I think its better to have the highest legendary droprate possible when opening megaboxes, because of the fact that you can multiple brawler drops from a megabox. (What if you get 2 legendaries at the same time from a megabox?) And I dont think your legendary multiplier resets within a megabox opening. So its best to abuse your legendary multiplier when opening a megabox. But thats just a theory, i dont know their algorithm :^)
---
island invasion+feast or famine=this
---
Honestly,fk u,how dare u team.
---
The star power shaves 100 dmg from a lvl 7 jessie attack. Which isn't going to save crow. Since she can still kill him in 3 hits.

Thats the thing i cant restart the game since it wont load and when i re download it, it stil says please verify installation EVEN after i verify TWICE

Stop blaming you being bad at the game on supercell lol. Get good.

That's a lot

It would help if you added some more details about the attack and super. What exactly is it? Does the character electrocute someone? If so, with what?

Pretty bad keyframing... Thanks for the effort

Very intresting but alot of 1 by 1 gaps.
---
Ooh lucky you and you are sad that you got crow Im 4.7K with all epics and my only higher rarity brawler is crow but I love crow soo

Crow is more agro. Piper is probably more similar since you just camp and deal a little t of damage per shot.

also dynamike with the lamp on the hard hat

I‚Äôm still not quite convinced tbh. That seems like a character that would make an interesting event mode. Maybe 3 players vs Thecit to take him down. He spawns boys to defend himself and the players have to work together to survive and defeat him?
---
MYSTERY HEROS
---
Neither a random puddle
---
excuse me i rarely team
---
So?
---
Fuck
---
neither 10 of them
---
I highly doubt that
---
creepy ninjas
---
Neither explosion when it's a tie
---
Power 1...
---
Thats so accurate
---
Happened to me today
---
Ace Skulls
---
well i could show proof but then again im not at 400 so damn you game system
---
Hey man! I'd like to ask you if I could use your clip as a part of my compilation of Brawl Stars Highlights. I'm an editor for the Gaming Curios network. You would be credited with your name on the screen along with a link to this post. Let me know, thank you! :)
---
I level up twice in a day and the game went like "stop"
---
I just hit rank 12 with a power level 1 gene. More hp and damage is nice but skill is always better.
---
Cavern churn too
---
or killing the players when someone scored a goal
---
Are you saying my mortis is not 500 trophies
---
aw... cute! :–∑
---
Lwarb?
---
You would need ca 9 years for this üòÇüòÇ
---
Me too same! Lmao
---
Crow doesn‚Äôt need a buff but bull does-guy who uses bull like crow
---
Or holding the ball
---
friend him
---
I havent claimed that its mine ü§£, like on photo or anything .
---
I just want some good karma üòÇ
---
I want to modify files without getting banned, so i thing lwarb is a great option
---
Melee bois had started a party
---
Jesus pam too
---
im out of ideas someone else continue this
---
Same
---
Didn't work for me about an hour ago but it's fixed now
---
Like the idea!
---
I am in exactly the same position as you. No legendaries but I don't mind. The game is free.
---
Gene is better than carl
---
Super pins
---
I'll blow you away with the power of my Stand, [ Spirit Bear] !
---
8.2k no legendary
---
Barley was drunk and he played some fortnite that is the reason why he dance like that.
---
Oh. Cool anyway I mean it's your art so  
---
Its your decision
---
oof
---
Tom and Jerry are meme stars now
---
Idk, I think there's some other players like me that would like to use all the characters :T
---
But it's good if u don't mind n.n
---
thx man :)
---
U didn't spend any time on it. Stop taking credit. This is from a private modded server whose artist did this
---
Shelly's super is bad though. You're kinda trash if you get killed by a super that has no range.
---
ew Panda Nita and Rockstar Colt are way better
---
hahahahah he's doing the default dance :0
---
Like Rico says: "Teamwork for the win"
---
at least CR gets new content
---
Yes, Nita.
---
Better be eXXXtra crispy
---
Goalkeeper of the year
---
considering you have a max Shelly low trophies and your other brawlers are high level it seems you are a P2W we don't take kindly to your kind around here
---
Nice idea.I think everyone should have a backstory.
---
Sheer Bear Attack
---
So first I'm being honest, this bug was caused when I turned off WiFi and background for cellular data for the game when CLONED. This accident made the game look cool and transparent, it sounds good but EVERYTHING was transparent on the UI WISE. It gave me a unfair advantage on gem grab that removed the both lines on the top, why is that unfair? It cleans out parts where you could see the enemy walking as in, more field of view. The health bar was gone it just was a white row of numbers. If I get the bug again to work, I will post more screenshots.
---
I do as well but Supercell wants to remodel her and they also want to remodel the base of Darryl (the barrel).
---
Very cool.
---
In other words, play in Island Invasion with Mortis.
---
5 mexicans for 1 woman
---
Im at 7,5k with 0 legendary everything but that
---
killer bruce already touched that idea. He didn't lol.
---
Rainbow legends
---
Funny Joke
---
we dont take lightly to your kind around here
---
The next Brawl Talk may come out next week or a bit later and the update will probably come out in May.
---
Damn. Sounds nice
---
Why bull, bull is literally the worst with the energy drink because of his low range, if you're colt or rico, he wouldn't mess with you.
---
Can I put this on okbr
---
When?
---
That's good
---
WoW
---
Haha thx for upvoting :)
---
It's LEECH LIFE. Also, they need to nerf Pam before ever bring it back, if they ever do.
---
I lost 4 matches of siege for playing with randoms and i only wanted the star token
---
Mortis with hat would look cooler.
---
It‚Äôs about trophy‚Äôs. Not power levels. They are all in your trophy range. It‚Äôs fair.
---
Thunder gang
---
i tried the brawlstars discord, was too toxic and childish.
---
if you want to see more, let me know! any ideas would help too!
---
simply lovely :D
---
I am trying to be original in Some way, but I apparantely I wasn‚Äôt, I guess you are right.
---
5/10... so close
---
Logically though, Brawl Stars isn't logical. I mean, who wears a dead bird or dead bear as a hat?
---
Nice.
---
*Darryl wants to know your location*
---
I feel bad for the teamer and autoaimer.
---
This deserve so much more attention lmao great work
---
Bro it wasn‚Äôt me, I had already been defeated, I was just recording
---
Yup it is.
---
GGs.
---
Look how they massacred my boy
---
I actually don‚Äôt get it, can some please enlighten me?
---
THEM CLEAN LINES
---
This is so cool!
---
Nah. It's the middle finger. Stay out of there Bull.
---
What about frank
---
&gt;I liked the vertical game more than the horizontal one
---
I can't agree more 
---
However, Landscape feels better for brawl stars tho
---
You can join Omen Calvary top 150 u.s(you can join either that clan or can try Omen Valor)
---
Hey I love it! Maybe it's his old ally...
---
This is totoally related to BrawlStars.
---
At point-blank range, auto-aim is useful because you can get your shots off faster
---
For some reason this made me think of a new game mode where a white Darryl acts as a pool ball and has to get all the other Darryls into six holes.
---
Pool mode.
---
Lucky pins (dont have Spike)
---
Portrait was horrible when it comes to player retention (how long ppl plays)

#SIEGE
---
This was shit new
---
Ouch
---
Even if this skin is awesome, I‚Äôm still going to avoid my taxes &gt;:U
---
Seems odd how SC  makes you lose trophies for a bot taking over when you crash at the start
---
This is from u tube
---
 Hey I made a post about this too!
---
Walk around it would make it better and do more things than just attack
---
Crow does not need a buff as long as you don‚Äôt use him like bull.
---
People will be playing bull as crow after the buff
---
Dandanno strikes again!
---
Thanks! (I'll try to do better next time I guess lol)
---
Colt
---
I kill so many mortis as dynamike lol. Just use one shot where they are and another in the direction that they will attack. This way, you can kill the mortis before it gets close to you and even if it does some damage you will out health the other person.
---
Lol 6999 trophies
---
Link please??
---
r/engrish
---
My friend had -1000 and gained it back in 3-5 days
---
Thank you!
---
lel
---
i find rico pretty easy to use in pretty much all gamemods. just saying
---
I want to be this kid but I want to be mortis instead
---
I don‚Äôt think this guy knows anything... Just saying
---
I like new rico
---
Good question
---
I thought it was a lot when I got 7 Pams and 3 Colts at 300 trophies yesterday.
---
Facts.
---
Feeling envy of players with skins is for plebs.
---
Change my mind.
---
And as long crows dirrect counters get nerfed he will be in the meta again
---
R/imamsoconfusedbecouseofallofthewooshes

Dude, don‚Äôt worry, it‚Äôs coming
---
1-wide gaps galore
---
Hi I'm new to reddit and also cool
---
Sorry for the flip screen
---
It's really great i love it!
---
This is a big problem in the lower trophy ranges. Like, the only reason to throw a game is to intentionally drop trophies. But half the time, the dudes that throw the game are that low in trophies that they don‚Äôt even lose any.
---
Seriously, why can‚Äôt they just play solo showdown and give their trophies to everyone else?
---
Such a nice guy(„Å•Ôø£ ¬≥Ôø£) ï„Å£‚Ä¢·¥•‚Ä¢ î„Å£
---
Those eyes
---
I thought my 300 trophie Colt going down to 200 trophies was bad. F.
