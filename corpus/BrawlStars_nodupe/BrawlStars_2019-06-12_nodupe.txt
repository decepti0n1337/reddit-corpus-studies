I found it on r/historymemes
---
---
---
wow thats actually kinda annoying
---
Also, Where did my boxes go?
---
Bull didn't get a faster movement speed for the super... You know how annoying it is for people to only step away of your super? Just give us like a 5 to 10% just something.
---
6+ players in real time?
---
Lol didn't even realize you could get the IKE with rico's star power
---
pay to win gemmer
---
Got a good laugh out of me!  Loved the resurrection via Poco branch üòÇ
---
looks like your opposing Bull's slow dsl line gave out in the favela
---
Why did I read that as raper Mortis?
---
is jessie still strong in siege now?
---
Yeah let me fix it

please, please don‚Äôt overbuff Mortis, 0.1 seconds is enough

Kinda. Her turret is useful for area control when you dont want people interfering with your bolt collecting, but it depends on player I guess

We need you

ahhh thanks for your input!

The joke here is that bull always camps in bushes

The joke here is that the small brawl box only gives small amounts of coins

The joke here is that the buff has almost no noticable effect

Obviously because there were people near it it targets the nearest enemies
---
He says as he plays rosa
---
But was it still funny? Yea
---
That would be true if her star power only didn't deal 35% of damage on the ike all by itself
---
Your team comp was honestly really bad that match I‚Äôd probably give up too
---
Me and the boys staring at the stars
---
But rosa is black
---
Yes I can't say how many times there's been a play that I did but wasn't recording it so it was lost forever

Dang but that is way too many power boxes

"Too it's not that" lol very constructive comment.

Ya but overall amazing

I can't stand the fact that you messed up the word **does,** It ruined the whole thing for me. 
---
:(
---
Nobody beats the Bullper
---
How about fixing your broken matchmaking and movement controls, instead of smearing %s back and forth?
---
Dread run from rosa destiny still arrives and now your nerf is here
---
You have some great points! I'm just a bit frustrated because this "trend" of "terrible players" started happening after the balance changes. Maybe it's because some people are coming back to the game and might be a bit rusty?
---
Piper meta strong with this one
---
Should be commercial skins for supercell, for 30 gems and limited time.
---
Yes
---
No :( 
---
Now Penny is gonna be so broken in my favorite game mode. 
---
I wish we could ban a breaker or something
---
Oh wow, rly? I boosted my piper, brock and tara to 460 on this map with randoms. Lvl 6, 7 and 6 respectively. You just have to constantly bush check and thats all, as soon as you have super - destroy bushes on the sides. These heroes are so op, shelly? Bull? No thanks
---
You don't need to get it.
---
dynamike: am i a joke to you?
---
Lmao his Dynamike is overleveled af
---
Like so supercell can see. Thanks!
---
The thing is that no one notices that goodboi steals art and claims it as his own
---
Nah
---
I was thinking that but everyone sucks equally. Also everyone uses Shelly down there. So if you did get a new brawlers from a box, usually primo or barley are first, and get completely wrecked too many times they could potentially rage quit and never start again. If you're just now starting there's not much to lose by doing so.
---
Time to take care of the weebs
---
My legendary chance is 0.9600%. How good of a chance is that? I have no mythics and legendary yet
---
Too cluttered
---
Why did you have to say (sorry for bad editing) 
---
Sorry for my bad English
---
I‚Äôm at .14 and don‚Äôt have mythic or legendary
---
SorryÔºåforgot the HAT
---
still remember in heist each team has a shelly and darryl
---
Yea I was at .1 then fucking supercell had to release a new brawler and boom .06 this luck system is bullshit
---
So you're the one who keeps stealing my win last second!
---
-9 y/o sis

No I got 3

You crying over it gives him what he wants why do you care it‚Äôs just a name

I know this post is old but I was looking for a BS wallpaper and this is the one I found. Thank you!
---
Looks cute and creepy at the same Time in a good way
---
Is this a joke?
---
I don't want to be too rude, but it's your.
---
also my legendary rate is suffering, around the 0.01 range.
---
SO IT GOT NEFT? LOL
---
So you litterally just go around reddit explaining jokes?
---
Bepis barley.
---
lol i instantly liked when i saw the bear in tuxedo
---
Thrower‚Äôs heaven
---
How you determine if Mortis is ok in this match? Because he scored? It is pure luck that you were dead not in .5 sec instead of 1 sec.
---
*Cries in not having a Legendary at 9600 and 8 brawlers at 500*
---
Yeah even better

also which device are u playing on? Gameplay is so smooth

Do they even spend any time testing their decisions

Maybe some time after the moment Maple Barley comes out.

Yeah.. I said I don't want to think about it

Yea you can, but can you private message instead next time?

Don't worry new Brock and Barley skins will be released soon

What is the best server for few playes?

This is ridiculous, if you google reverse image search any of ‚Äúhis‚Äù art, you can see that he stole all of them.
---
Congrats! Btw how many brawlers do you have?

All the turret spammers now got their wish, but at what cost? Every player quits lol.

This happened to me too. I thought I had just missed
---
Wow
---
Well, you're right, I mean, how do a human and a robot mates??
---
I shouldn't really complain since i got everything except them.
---
It doesn‚Äôt work in bots YET, because they didn‚Äôt update the client yet, which manages how Penny‚Äôs star power works in places like the training cave and friendly games.
---
Right? It‚Äôs so weird. And for a long time now...
---
Indeed rip my boy Peter
---
training cave and 'friendly' games are not yet updated
---
OBJECTION... PENNY DIDNT GET MADE BY FRANK BANGING A PRINCESS
---
It's confusing because seconds is not a unit of speed, it's a unit of time, so it should say 'Reload time: -4%'
---
Reload speed should have a unit of 'ammo reloaded per second'
---
What country do I change it to lol
---
Wait a minute. You are that map that was on the front page from pixelcrux LIKE
---
The icon on the right shiws my trophies right now
---
I have Shiba Nita and his name is shiby
---
It isn't even that hard if u use pc.
---
He edited
---
That is exactly why I only said that it LOOKED like the one u/SaltedSpirits made, not that it was inspired by it.
---
But they would've won if they spun for .5 seconds longer. That would leave no time for the ball to go in enemy goal.
---
Never to be found again
---
As a bush camping shelly, you cab easily annoy us with a long range brawler. Just shoot into the bush.
---
Scrappy is the definition of spray and pray
---
i guess its coded to shoot not in a line, but in a cone like the shotgunners, so if scrappy is far away it will miss the shots that are on the far left/right side of the cone
---
So it will be worth the -30 trophies
---
I'm not gonna lie, I'm that kind of person. If you fuck with me I will make sure you die, even if I die too. I don't play with logic, I play with vengeance.
---
So........ which brawler deserved the title to be called as ‚ÄúBrawl Meta Knight‚Äù?
---
‚ÄúRandoms are good‚Äù they say
---
I'm upvoting since this is the worst matchmaking I've ever seen
---
and that is why it will miss more shots if the enemy is far away. its the same with shelly and bull, if the enemy is far away not every bullet of the shot will hit the target
---
ThugSanta?
---
I agree
---
O o o f
---
Makes sense. It would be a really tight cone though.
---
So satisfying üòÇ

Probably very annoyed but at the same time not too fussed as you didn‚Äôt lose trophies and there would have been very little you could do to win anyway.
---
Messing with mortis is like playing with explosive chemicals. A little too much can make him op

 everyone understood, it's already great '-'

It was always like this

Damn u are dumb

I'm f2p and i have 3 star powers

Same at me

They buffed my copycat!

Got 11k tr but still doesn't have mortis or legendaries

Nice, but that clip lasted a lot longer than Poco does in Showdown...

Maybe he learned to shoot from a Stormtrooper.

Uh why is your brawl stars icon different than mine
---
Shoulda licked more nuts while u had the chance  Rosa
---
Wow! Looks awesome!
---
Guys I didnt know this was a repost, I never saw this on Reddit before, sorry!!!
---
no like i made this
---
The only thing left is maple barley, and that‚Äôs coming out Friday morning if I‚Äôm not wrong. I‚Äôm imagining that they release the brawl talk within the next few days and shoot for Monday for the update because that‚Äôs the 2nd anniversary of soft launch? Either way, it‚Äôs been about a month (3 weeks) since the last update so I imagine it‚Äôs not to far way.

*Ahh shit,here we go again*

Spike, i choose you!
---
First of all, Gene could pull in the other team in gem grab and just steal a butt load of gems from them, and could also pull in someone with a lot of stars in bounty and get a free kill, how is Gene bad? Second of all, Rosa was absolutely broken! If you got a little too close, you‚Äôre dead unless you were a Bull or Shelly with super, and with her super, literally nothing could stop her. I really think you are sort of misjudging those brawlers.
---
Ah, I style my hair like that and I look like I am wearing an ushanka...
---
Hey chill chill I was just joking people can have their own opinions and I respect that, don't mean to start any sort of fight
---
It's better than your shitty tier lists
---
It's ok Man! I'll have a look anyway.
---
This meme is too overused ._.
---
Good luck at pulling tanks I guess, and his pulling hand is even shorter so if you pull a support the tank will come to crush you
---
50% of the brawlers have the same laugh

Yeah man, 0.1

No it isn't boi it's a fresh oc

Not rico, piper
---
How ?
---
Tanks are never used as gem carriers, those are usually healers, and a Poco or Pam isn‚Äôt going to stand a chance against 3 other people all at once. And in bounty, with the exception of the map that is Snake Prairie, tanks are never used in bounty, so you‚Äôll probably pull in a Piper or Brock most of the time which, again, can‚Äôt win a 1v3.

Guys with all these comments i came to a conclusion legendaries are the worst because of  their rarity they are too bad for how rare they are so i think legendaries are pretty much bad if we talk about their rarity

NO FUCKING WAY

Barleys are NOT the teamers

Yes, its Sub-Zero reference.

You forgot the piper peri and Brock meme. Y‚Äôknow where there‚Äôs 5 brocks surrounding one piper. It‚Äôs not a general format but it‚Äôs still a semi popular meme
---
What about players with the name ??? ?
---
At first they were ??? on the lobby but when I played with him as his teammate, his name was blank during gameplay
---
A tool.? That‚Äôs a new one. And what comment are you referring to

I'd like to see brock I mean the brawl stars brock
---
bruce is my name

clawing is my game

I really liked those descriptions where they were actually putting Brawlers full names (Ex: Piper de la Prim, Bull Blanco) and their backstories

Okay, thank you for critiquing a tiny detail instead of the overall idea of what we‚Äôre debating. The moment you start doing that we both know you don‚Äôt really have a clue about what you‚Äôre saying. And downvoting everything I comment, very mature.

I think the original map is in CaptainSparklez first survival games video

Gene star power is that he heal friendly brawler. 200 health per second. My side is that it will be so much helpful if gene could be able to crab his teammates and give them 50 health for like 2 seconds. I am Sorry that I respond late.
---
ive seen many post of these before...
---
Bull.exe
---
Luckily it would be a pretty easy fix to just tweak the cannon to only shoot like 2-3-4 cannon balls. It would still be good, but not 10080 damage good.
---
Buff poco meme
---
There is actually a report button in the game but you can only report people via the chat
---
I think one of his clubmates reported him in the chat
---
Doesn't it have the same meaning as hope you like it?

Idk why others do but for me I didn‚Äôt have enough room on this layout I don‚Äôt usually like one gap but I had to in this situation

I tried tapping this im so stupid

Yeah xd

I don‚Äôt like the aspect of multiple people having the same names, either.  If one name is taken, you should have to pick a new one.

Penny and darryl can join team aqua

That‚Äôs amazing

Why u so salty

Gardevoir says hi
---
No it just changes leaderboards but matches load way slower on higher trophies
---
[deleted]
---
Penny
---
Stop this madness
---
Honestly man I don't think she really needs a buff. You just have to know how to use correctly. I'd say to keep your distance from other brawlers. She's only good in certain modes as well. Bounty, some gem grab, sometimes heist, and some showdown maps
---
nothing they are just there to make the artwork look bad thats all
---
POCO DOESN'T NEED A GODDAMN BUFF
---
So many WW II scenarios hehehe...
---
This looks better imo

Nope, not sure why you‚Äôre so mad lmao.

I got leon when i had 2100 trophies
---
Forgot about Tara as well
---
But Tara is the master of being support
---
What's small? Her bust?
---
Impossible
---
That's awesome dude!
---
Poco isnt that bad, his main role is gem carrier, but the problem is that he gets outshined, but he's not bad
---
is it Crow? is it Bull?
---
Tara isnt bad, if you know how to play Tars, she's a very good brawler
---
Where the heck are the IKEs
---
I'll be Gene in gen grab and will pull bull to me when I have all the gems
---
This lovely French Canadian is freezing the competition!
---
His standard shot, he gets 3 shots slower reload. He fires a large ice cube that is lobbed that explodes on an impact of an enemy or becomes a block of terrain (they last 10 seconds then melt)
---
His super he creates a large igloo, that has 5000 health and protects anyone inside. Those inside cannot fire, and has to use a shot to leave.
---
His star power is whenever he walks he leaves ice behind him 5 squares that slows enemies and speeds up allies.
---
He is a low damage support.
---
Shelly is very bad if you look at competitive, thats why she gets buffed
---
Yea sometingh like that
---
Ooooo aaaaa
---
r/eastereggs
---
Poco must become meta one day
---
Finally someone who gets it
---
Repost
---
Yeah but she has been average from a really long time I think she deserves a buff
---
?
---
That's amazing!
---
Got to admit it's a pretty cool cross over
---
Same thing has been posted before
---
Break it up he was a good player I have three max brawlers so I shouldn‚Äôt of said yep lol

Guess mine. ;)

You're totally right, im glad I dont have to type all of this cuz you didü§£üòÇ

Talk about what?

I sometimes play pvz gw2

See this as a teenager Leon, your body proportions aren't quite like a kid's when you're 17 lol

This is actually cool :D

How did you make the hoodie? I wanna try making my own (possibly)
---
Sweden is all forest lol
---
What is the pun line.
---
 I am also impressed, but more disappointed.
---
Sometimes
---
The bushes speak to me
---
Because Barley is not meta, obviously.
---
Where is it?

Most of like gene is thicc as a patote

Ya know, a round like and also small, a patote

What if respawns while cooking mine is not very happy about losing his gems
---
did no one see those brock skills against bibi
---
Not taking it seriously, just saying my opinion üëç
---
I'm saying that right now, he's a bit underpowered. Read my original again. He has Brawlers who do his job better in Gem - Pam, Bo, Gene, etc. His ONLY good mode right now is Brawl Ball. Just because he's good in one mode doesn't make him OP - he's terrible in almost every mode. I was never, EVER referring to that meta. He just needs a slight boost, not something to return to that caliber.
---
AlWaYs
---
You know before Crow buff they actually buff him as -0.1 time reload speed so dont worry boi
---
First of all piper isn't bad at all which makes me question ur in game mastery. Second of all, why wouldn't you pick a nice team comp and a strategy based on the map? Ah also poco works very well with randoms so I have no idea what ur talking about. Nice range, damage, super, everything else and you still ask for a buff eh ?
---
How bout: NO!
---
Then there is nothing more that I can do
---
Awesome idea hope this gets to hot so more people see it!
---
Well thats your opinion. I like overwatch and I play it and its amazing
---
( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)

Great map too
---
As a Swede, I can say this is completely accurate
---
no!!! pls tell me
---
Under 50 tr you can rush anywhere, big noobs cant bother you
---
Yeah lol
---
But thank you for noticing
---
Oh no this could totally ruin a team fight, also ruins the satisfaction of stacking supers
---
No shit, it‚Äôs a nerf 2 Darryl‚Äôs with star power and a buff 2 ones without
---
Sure, but the remodel looks better, the animations are well done, the skins look good, I‚Äôm sure animators spent hours of their precious time making this just for the community to hate them for it. Seriously, if you think you could do a better job feel free. For now I stand with the animators who put in a lot of work to make the remodel.
---
Yeah this is different from the Drake meme

Idek if this is a good map. If you think so please like through the link so it might be added, but if not can anyone leave thoughts and criticisms so I can make it better

just because someone spend a lot of time to make something doesn't mean its good. i just dont like forced goofiness onto a character which was the most serious one. same goes with mortis voice over.

I don't know why they removed it. So suddenly, and they aren't even saying anything about it...global players don't even know about the lore.

Nice.

It's a showdown map

Probably my favorite map lol

Oh,makes sense

THAT BROCK IS A DEMOMAN

Create a map of Finland because that's where supercell is

Sure go ahead if you want I have an other one on my reddit page

Just europe, m8 ;D

I will update it a bit with... hmmm... "airlines"

Lol, who wouldn't tho
---
This is so low res that it hurts my eyes.
---
Good job trying to steal
---
Yeah. This is so fun that i remembered you about uk's problem. But is is just a game map. XD
---
At least the Allstar does 6 range damage.
---
Bill has tits?
---
wait for snake prarie, really easy to push max Bo.
---
Reminds me of ig-88 from Star Wars, very nice!
---
I know his overall health while engaging is lower, but I like the current Darryl than the old Darryl(last patch). That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs a buff for me, you can‚Äôt really say it‚Äôs a *nerf*, they shifted the power in his SP blah blah blah you get it, as I said, by the way I play I prefer having higher base health than shield power.
---
Just 1420 regular boxes. You‚Äôd probably pull 1 but not 2.
---
Ooo do Darryl next
---
I think it looks meh but I don‚Äôt think it needs to change. The one that OP proposed actually looks kinda dope though.
---
I'm Bull. (I live in Finland)

Your on that fan fiction shit m8
---
That's what the key points are for ;)
---
Haha thank you

I think it's meant to try and read Brawler movement ie strafes and retreating

Her turret fires a barrage of bombs when destroyed. It used to fire the barrage of bombs in random directions, but the most recent update made her turret target the barrage at opponents when destroyed. Now it‚Äôs too powerful, especially in siege and heist. She was already powerful in siege, now it‚Äôs just dumb.

poco is okay, he‚Äôs in an *OKAY* spot... but he‚Äôs easily replaceable and he‚Äôs not the best option (like pam, who is very much better than him) poco needs a buff to push him back into the meta a little bit, he‚Äôs a one trick pony

CoC is more competitive, has more longevity, more things to do, more social things to do, it‚Äôs easier to upgrade and progress, and isn‚Äôt luck based. 
---
CoC is better than brawl stars.

UwU me like

He really doesn't need a buff though? I'm at 7000 trophies and he is the only Brawler i have at 500 trophies. I have pushed him mostly on Gem Grab and Brawl Ball, he also works on Duo Showdown. He is good right now.
---
WTF IS THIS POCO!
---
FBI OPEN UP
---
I have him at 500 too, he is really good.
---
Now you got the buff ahah enjoy
---
Under 200 trophies anything is possible
---
I approve as a TF2 player
---
Mortis is all but useless as a teammate at everything but high trophies except for sometimes brawl ball. I don‚Äôt play him and probably wouldn‚Äôt even if he got buffed. I just want competent teammates.
---
Oof it was m8
---
yes
