Me at 14.5k trophies

I have mini
---
I mean she have a Poco's picture on her phone when you select her in the menu so idk...
---
we have a new pirate environment being put into rotation alongside mortis' mortuary with skins being sold that are christmas themed and pirate themed with new futuristic-style brawlers. the brawlidays are a clusterfuck of themes.
---
Speaking about the center : you have 6 access points to the center and they are too small. What will be the consequence ? The player will fight each other for the  access first and won't even be able to shoot the robot. It will become a solo show down before the real takedown (shooting the robot) even starts.   
---
When the robot will be on one side, if you respawn on the other side (which happens most of the time to the players) you'll not only have to travel through the map but also to fight once again to get through these  entanglement points without alternative.   
---
To make it short, if you make it once near the robots, you'll probably win. That's not a good thing for a map.
---
[here the same comic but made better](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ)
---
How am I only thinking about the top 1%? extending the trophy road would affect everyone lmao. Its not my fault that u dont play the game like everyone else ü§£ I don't even grind the game and ive been done with it for over a year.
---
So true!
---
My favorite is Corsair Colt, then Captain Carl and then Pirate Poco
---

---
And I was only able to buy Pirate Poco. But okay, he's still nice
---
I mean that ghosts are most of time in movies, tv shows, are invisible, that's why I think one of his Star Powers should make him invisible.
---
I'm a non english speaker too don't worry
---
Thank you but I was wondering how to get different fonts
---
Yea I was thinking this too. They should make it so the skins can be your profile picture icon. It wouldn‚Äôt make sense to make them the brawler ‚Äúprofile‚Äù picture on the selection screen.
---
Instructions unclear, dick stuck in toaster
---
nvm im retarded
---
Or was it Arkansas
---
uh,
---
Firs of all how the heck you hack the game, it‚Äôs impossible. And second I think they are doing now every summer just like the last one, so it‚Äôs timed and paced.
---
When you press the x button instead of accept
---
well i don't have bea but i guess you need a teamcomp with rosa and emz, bibi is good too (spike can be a good choice for defence)
---
*This is rule 34 police speaking, drop the pen now.
---
Lol
---
Probably not
---
How do you know if you can't see them? Ghost would look like the ones from graveyard shift
---
I mean it is still his fault to claim it for his own
---
It looks really really good
---
Where is it?
---
A. Shelly hard counters bull, because she has more range and bull can‚Äôt defend her super. This is pretty normal.
---
B. Shelly sucks. She can literally only deal with tanks and nothing else. If you just learn how to keep your distance then you‚Äôll be fine. Once you start playing more you‚Äôll see that the only mode that Shelly is good in is brawl ball.
---
Aw yes, JSAB!
---
Darryl ora the best
---
I just made a new account and found some lvl 10 accounts with star shelly. How do thet get it?
---
It‚Äôs a good game if you want to hear some good songs
---
U mean taken down
---
Just use the new search feature and look for good players
---
6k definitely isn‚Äôt competitive. I‚Äôm 15k and I‚Äôm nowhere near competitive.
---
EMZ stands for Evil Magical Zombie
---
It‚Äôs just on the map Naughty Elves, as I understand it. It‚Äôs a dynamic map, like Minecart Madness, meaning the map changes throughout the match.
---
You are super gay
---
Then when is competitive. When you are #1? I think 15k is competitive enough
---
\&gt; punishing people for not using it 
---
Nobody's being punished for not using a service that's provided, *gratis,* to back up your account. But with every single mobile game, regardless of the company: if your account isn't connected to anything -- or if the service it's connected to is on an account that your device isn't currently linked to (or so forth), you're setting yourself up to have a **bad** time.

*CRIES IN RICO FANBOY*

Can‚Äôt you just get it. Supercell did this on purpose, it is not a glitch, it is happening to everyone.

---
Love the Lovecraftian vibe on this
---
Ah, que pena ;-; desenho lindo de qualquer forma
---
How does getting a brawler reduce gold?
---
Hace you guys considered the fact of opposite spawning as a feature in some modes? It was a blast to think and move the other way as usual, specially when you didn't expect it. Some 3vs3 maps would be interesting to have that quirk on them.
---
I had Bea at 500 trophies in the first day, isn‚Äôt much but still proud
---
Just Sad Zombie noises cause spike can't make noises
---
This meme makes me want to commit toaster bath,Ricardo milos is such an old meme
---
More than likely, they were randoms. You were a coordinated premade team of randoms. Assuming this is brawl ball, they had a better comp. Which is hilarious considering you still hit play with a random who wanted to use mike in brawl ball.
---
Va bene, questo √® epico
---
Isn‚Äôt it just an extension of the trophy road?
---
Why is thiss oddly satisfying

At least you lob the present instead of rolling it which prevents trickshotting

Yep. All people do is beg
---
It's possible if you are playing since beta without getting a single legendary yet. I started playing since global and got my first Legendary during August where I checked before getting him it was 1.092%. If a beta player still didn't received a Legendary means the odds can be near 2.000

What's up with the nipple knees? Otherwise great job!

I currently own 3 legendary and the left out odds of getting the last legendary is 0.6

When I started the game I thought you could get a brawler from the bonus items
---
I love sandy icon. Emz's is okay but Max is trash

Am I the only one who thinks this looks slightly like Velma?

Yes, I‚Äôm glad someone posted this. I am also an F2P and have been playing since global. This was the strategy I‚Äôve been using since the game came out, only spending gems on the doubler/ticket deals. I have one suggestion though: use a couple of tickets on Boss Fight. Boss Fight can actually be an easy way to get a nice chunk of tokens because of the progressive increase of rewards. I‚Äôd say go until Master, as this is where the risk starts to dramatically increase. Other than that, I use this guide religiously.
---
I have all brawlers except for Max and Sandy (though I‚Äôll get Sandy soon because my Legendary Chance is so high). I have 13 Brawlers above level 9 and have 13 star powers in total.

please, die already

What box?
---
Wheres the banana for scale
---
Trophy road till 15k is not big enough at all. What about extending it to 25k? Rework most of the rewards for the 10k league, adding a new league, put a smaller version of your idea at 18k and adding a big reward at 25k. 
---
I'm well aware there's barely anyone at 25k but I think extending it to that amount will prevent another big complain from the community until more ppl reach that milestone. Which is going to take some time, time that will be helpful for the dev team to worry about other issues in the meantime.
---
Nice art mate

Exactly same
---
I think the idea of her mechanic is that she is supposed to be a support character and not someone who can do a lot of damage. If she did a lot of damage with that kind of speed, she would be game breaking.
---
Ther is an optional update go on google play or apple store and supdate the game it will fix this
---
Poco :(
---
I updated it and it still is doing dis
---
tbh I used to read a lot of manga and I started to again so seeing the comic made me think I have to read from right to left, *I appreciate the disclaimer*
---
That‚Äôs a lot of pwercubes
---
It was actually 8 days in between my last brawler and bea. Maybe like 20 - 35 boxes?
---
Can you continue this as a series? So dope.
---
Wtf no
---
Yes, but about half a year too late
---
Really? In that case the bug only apears when you clic play again, so yea the only solution i see is dont clic play again

Idk i just put it as bug

Insert Skyrim reference

So was this bug fixed?

Oh, alright, thank you :)

How did you do the tentacles?

B

i cant believe i still only have 1 star power and missing 2 legends
---
But you can't even use a controller in Brawlstars though. Even if you prefer touch, your thumbs get in the way so you're at a disadvantage in showdown when moving from top to bottom.
---
What games have you played that have both controller and touch support btw? I'm looking for good mobile games.

Shouldn't Rosa be there too?

Sorry for bad English BTW

Payed for it you would've shown the box recap showing coins power points and unlocked brawler icon

I could try and help you. I‚Äôm good at English, and photoshop. And I have a thing on my phone that lets me draw pictures, so I could try and draw the brawler and then send you the images.

Man that was clean nice one.

This is so realistic and amazing! It is pretty creepy and edgy but that's so cool! Anyways, BRB, gotta go find a clean pair of pants now

Max isn't out yet so she doesnt count atm

on the new maps in present plunder, when rico and piper are in the same game, mistletoe appears.

You know that‚Äôs rude because that‚Äôs a monk you can‚Äôt be doing that it‚Äôs rude.

What about the second legendary that I need at 16k.

I am pretty sure that only happens with legendaries.

Congrats man! She is really fun once u get used to her

Don't be happy she sucks

Nope, every brawler, I am at 12k still waiting get mortis, combine my mini I have 14k, no mortis

Very cool

No need to be so defensive, i know, gj on crediting the original. However, there ARE dumb and blind ass normies that think you made everything.
---
The rest of the points will just not be used.
---
No that are all three throwers
---
So I lose them?

you'll get coins for the remaining points

why the hell would you cut off the credit

Wow thanks, good luck with your condition.

i'm pretty sure it's 1 point = 2 coins

Leon ver
---
You are traitor lol
---
Sounds like you had 11k trophies 3 months ago, so I wouldn't be so sure about that. Even so any moron can get 17k trophies today because of the trophy gain rework, so that is not an indicative if you're good or not. On top of that you think you're better than me even though you've never seen me play. And the cherry on the top is that you're probably in elementary school given your posts so git gud. I won't waste more time arguing with a kid, believe what you want.
---
keep going
---
Still no

That sounds like the zombies of hl2.

**confusion 100**

Piper and Brock should be sniper. 
---
Bull should be bush-camper. 
---
Sandy should be support. 
---
Nita, Jessie and Penny should be summoners.
---
Real poco hours

Ok thank you!
---
Will you do also a poco pirate review?
---
Makes sense, also hi other poco

Aka the more realistic version

Yes, i am playing everyday

What's the name or link to your lore?

Great! Then I will watch the second review too: I'm a bit uncertain between these two skins.
---
Ah, that makes sense and would totally fit mortis!
---
2 of his voice lines merged once. He said don‚Äôt make me get NITAAA!

The rules are : 1 play as max 2 charge super 3 go to the wall so the bot can‚Äôt shoot u 4 use super and walk to the bot 5 without getting shot 6 get to the line i was shooting at the beginning 7 without getting shot 8 post the vid at ur profile 9 comment done and let us see u do it

1 small idea: the mines should be a uncracked egg, when explode the animation shows the egg cracking
---
he needs a hand to slap the legs also
---
Oh right. Personally I think u should get santa mike coz he is great value for 49 gems. Pirate poco is good but 80 gems is quite a lot. Plus u might be able to save up for both of them in the 20 days u have left to get them.
---
Bro, I feel you...
---
Im at 11K with a mythic and two legendaries bruh
---
There are power cubes in the middle, that both teams can take and fight over (or the defending team can choose to stay close to the safe).
---
I experimented with tnt and power cubes in a 3v3 mode (as you see).
---
I also needed to add indestructible walls so that brawlers like colt aren‚Äôt so OP from the bushes.
---
This is my first map concept, and I want feedback, thank you:)
---
What an idiot
---
I tried and the answer is yes
---
Why nsfw?
---
But that works
---
11/10. It's too perfect.
---
I got spike 2 days ago
---
Although star shelly uses star-shaped bullets. You still have a point. There's nothing wrong in keeping the Brawler's original theme. Without it we will not have 30 gem-skins we have today.
---
I know, it would be cool to add something like that back into the game, but thank you üòä.
---
Piper killing colt upclose because of ambush starpower 2019 colorized.
---
Ahahaha
---
I guess thats because i didnt got any legendary so my drop rate didnt decrease
---
#what are you talking about?

Yeah

I wanted max but got sandy, bea, and three star powers so life could be worse

Oh no no,this IS supercell fault,its not like guys pushing 500 brawlers to 700 being only level 4/5 and whining for getiing starpwred enemies,its the real problem.That should be fixed.

I had 50 boxes, 7big boxes and a megabox. I thought I'd get at least a starpower :/

Hahaha buff leon hahahaha teaming bad

I didn't even noticed that Feast or Famine got removed! D:

All I was doing was just wondering why it wasn't the current map when it was the Energy Drink modifier D:

I‚Äôll just agree..

I'm what

You did not misspell

Gosh darn this just got embarrassing

cursed image

Sand is a weapon of immeasurable power.
---
Translation: really good/fantastic
---
Because that's what gentlemen do
---
Her expression makes her seem like she blew a fuse.
---
man i also opened my 10k box and surprisingly got my first legy leon after one whole year of playing even though i play very very little so it was a very historical moment
---
Thanks
---
I know. I do take Spanish
---
This is perfect he should just be a punching bag with no power and barely any health
---
I opened 150 boxes and all I got was fkin bandaid I'm sad
---
I am guessing u aren‚Äôt saying anything cuz ur embarrassed to admit that ur wrong ?! Lol
---
8 but is there
---
Dynamike: are you challenging me?
---
Imagine getting that mad about a mobile game üò≥
---
Oh he is phew less mistakes by me lol
---
But he is. He's just sitting in a tall place :&gt;
---
I opened 50 big + 400 boxes and only got Bea after 300, still need Sandy and Max
---
r/lootstars
---
Same but only with 14k
---
Imagine the turret actually doing about 1200 damage per hit
---
The point stands it's not worth buying one of these shitpiles.
---
You are a wat
---
Those don‚Äôt really count soooo yea,,!
---
Le meto el deo, dice porfavor
---
Ok I will
---
*Cries in no legendaries*
---
^(Bushes don't grow back anymore)
---
No, one team attacks only, and one defends only.
---
It goes on time, so for example, if the safe is over 50 percent health, after one and a half minute, the team that defends win.
---
This is just an example.
---
Snapping
---
Nitas, ricos, bos, pams and Brocks too
---
I got bea and sandy with no max today and i had 300 boxes and 25 big boxes but i wanted max since sandy aint all that great, but hey j maxed them out and still have 12k gold
---
Why is the video so long
---
Right
---
Actually 3
---
Maple barley
---
Without meteor its a pretty good map
---
You guys are getting legendaries ?
---

---
-_-
---
o_o
---
check my profile
---
No it‚Äôs the best map ever
---
I just want peoples opinions
---
Sorry but: *want, *throphies
---
I saved 16 big boxes and 162 boxes. I wanted to screen record the entire box opening until I got Max but didn‚Äôt manage to record the first 2 big boxes I opened
---
Placing 2nd, 3rd &amp; 4th also gives trophies though
---
Beeutiful
---
I'm not impressed
---
Baby yoda is a bad meme. End of Discussion.
---
They removed this map? Finnaly!
---
I know bu even with the best chance he cant get to 1000 trophies im trying to say that
---
#like this
---
Guys checkout my YouTube channel Kratmax Gaming for amazing gaming videos
---
Wtf? Mine doesn't look like that at all, must be a bug on some devices?
---

---
Tick: Thrower  
---

---
Emz: Fighter  
---
El-Primo: Heavyweight  
---
Barley: Thrower  
---
Poco: Support/Healer  
---
Rosa: Heavyweight  
---
Rico: Sharpshooter  
---

---
Crow: Annoying Assassin/Toxic Assassin  
---

---

---
Why would you use her instead of Piper? Serious question
---
I bought a mega box yesterday and got gene lmao. I got Bea two days ago out of a regular box. 
---
Only at 7.8k and I have all epics and 2 mythicals.
---
I mean I guess but it‚Äôs pretty obvious wut I mean
---
I've played her 3 games. I don't like her either.
---
Check out this player's profile: https://brawland.com/player/RQRYPQLV
---
Not fake.
---
I think with this modifier the map even better, I like it! (Unpopular opinion i guess)
---
So
---
Why do u repeat after me??
---
I got Bea out of free box so that gave me more chances to get max.
---
And for revenge, he move his ship over another again
---
r/fuckemojipolice
---
I opened a similar number of boxes as you had and got
---
- 6000 gold
---
- tickets, gems, and doublers
---
:))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))
---
For the record the odds that I pulled zero brawlers and zero star powers (calculated out with odds I don‚Äôt get an epic (about 40%) times the same but for mythics, then legendaries, then star powers) came out to about 5%. My odds to pull all three missing brawlers were nearly as good as my odds of nothing at all.
---
I like penny more
---
Sorry if u didn't like it lol
---
That's just example of what kind of person you are... And if u don't want to do it u still can't talk in everyones name..
---
But Sandy IS a boy
---
Yeah pretty much
---
bad Sparky where's the zap or the electro Wizard or the zappies
---
And Bibi should be changed to ‚Äúcontrol‚Äù
---
Damn bro that was my last mistake made in my life üò∞
---
So supercell don't get any money?
---
What is sense of free skins if supercell main income come from skins?
---
Uyeah i will believe you for now

Goodbye everybody, I've got to goooo~
---
I had 0.0096 once
---
She is proving superiority to the other Brawlers.
---
dude im 13k and i dont have any legendaries nor max nor bea
---
omfg this is one of the best plays I have ever seen woaaah
---
Coiled snake is really good for this as long as you don‚Äôt waste all of your ammo.
---
I respect your opinion.
---
__But why?__
---
OH GOD IT'S SANS LEON
---
Ah, last night I was playing, got a brawler. Thought it was Bea or Max, but got Spike finally.
---
I opened 10 big boxes and 102 brawl boxes and got 6 brawlers, I was shook that I got 6, one being Leon who is already rank 15 just today
---
Tf2 x brawl stars
---
That always when someone create newmeme template
---
Best skin ever!!! ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
I don‚Äôt think in SpongeBob because im Spanish and here Sandy is Arenita xD
---
Agreed, but its cool for him
---
It better not.
---
Love going to school the bullies didn't stand a chance!
---
WTF is this?
---
What is a cadries I‚Äôm stupid
---
Can't relate. Didn't got Max yet
---

Almost everyone knew that days ago when the optional update released
---
r/antimeme
---
Yes. And he disappears when we play with him
---
The glow is really good, I'd like to see more of neon brawlers! :D
---
Spot on!
---
No, no it's fantastic, I just think you should.. hone your skills. And chin.
---
I heard there an Easter Egg when Rico and Piper are played together what happens on the boat?
---
Just make jessie big boss attack to 1350 damage and spawn health to 4990
---
Aso super charge 50% slower
---
For nita the same but for Bruce health will be 5000
---
It's just that the daggers from ur super go out from the bot not in. It works on the boss because it has a bigger radius hit box. For say normal brawlers they made it where u can't one shot them I'm u jump or land on them.
---
F
---
Baby Yoda is a great meme. Eat my scrunchie.
---
my friend got mortis and crrow in free chest
---
My luck suck
---
I havent get any champion since bibi get relesed.
---
Like i play every day and didint get any mythics or legendary. Literly all of my champions are 20rank or higher i dont have champions to play now
---
My account is cursed for sure
---
!remindme 1 day
---
"No"
---
I saved 400 boxes and 50 big boxes and only got Bea
---
lil helper penny coolest skin in the game and i think they will change its effects in later updates
---
While not 4 boxes apart, I had 11 big boxes and ~110 boxes and got max, Bea, a star power, and 8x 200 doublers. Couldn't believe it.
---
Leon* ?
---
r/shittybrawlstars r/ihadastroke
---
Pam is healer
---
But I think they should re-look about 8-bit
---
Beautiful! Incredible work by you, it looks more polished and I love how it's 3D!
---
Max super on rico with robo retreat with energy drink(for Carl super fast dont stack I tried the bug to give Carl rico star power)
---
Bibi is even more frustrating lol
---
Poco is also a healer
---
He could've placed 2-4th any number of times without us knowing so there's plenty of chance.
---
Man
---
What?
---
Relax bro
---
Not the same

HEY ME TOO

---
Jokes on you, it's still 2019 and all I miss is exactly Sandy and Max
---
You can save the gems. And I don't think 2 star powers are too many. Each brawler has 2 starpowers and they are like 60 in total.
---
How do you know your not OP
---
I've seen brawl ball trolls, i've seen gem grab trolls, hec, i even saw bounty trolls
---
But trolling in Present Plunder. Holy.

And you can make her shoot electro balls!!!!

The number of afk players and trolls in the game recently is through the roof. When the new update came out, I had 6 games in a row in the new game mode that had an afk on my team... Had about 4 games so far where one player kept throwing the gift back to the enemy.

BEEEEETCH!

I am waiting here to hunt a good r/woooosh

it's true ....
---
Petition for Darryl to change class type to "Rolling Heavyweight."
---
Roasted him
---
Really?
---
WTF
---
yes im not made the template.
---
But I REDRAW IT.
---
So it's mean i make the template special for our sub
---
Wow,best post on this sub
---
Guys its works as a downvote too
---
1. Go in the middle.
---
2. Avoid the boxes.
---
3. Wait till someone starts shooting.
---
4. Steal kills.
---
5. Profit.
---
This is how I got some of my Brawlers from 100 trophies to 500. Sometimes you would be the only one in the middle and could get all the boxes and sometimes you decided that it's not worth it and go away. It was always the psychological game.
---
But at least it‚Äôs a minecraft stack of games
---
Say Shike right now
---
That's true. I hope they will do something with that.
---

---
Shoulda given her crazy hair like the Electro Wizard and a hat that looks like the Electro Dragon, but nonetheless this is a cool skin
---
I had a hard laugh.. ‚Äústeamers‚Äù xD
---
your post was great... but this template is just everywhere
---
What you have done has made god very unhappy
---
Can we change Piper's one from sharpshooter to sniper like Bea?
---
Well better than scoring the wrong way..... twice
---

Would make the turret a wheeled cannon

Jessi throws a wheeled cannon then breaks when touching the floor into a stationary cannon
---
When she has the bouncing bullets star power she throws that one you drew i forgot the name in inglish

Thank you. Was quite enjoyable.

Nice art bro!

I say Leon for invisiheal
---
I like this map :/
---
Im Malaysian
---
now say that whitout crying
---
That's from line in YouTube
---
Yeah it sucks so much I wish they kept them exclusive and just made new ones :(
---
No. Piper is a real name. They did the same with Bea. They pick names based on the brawler's features. Piper rhymes with sniper, so they picked Piper.
---
I had something similar
---
Day 1 : I open a megabox in the store and nothing. My friend says "That one won't give you anything, THAT one does" opens free box and gets Piper
---
Day 2 :
---
- Morning : Pam
---
- Evening : Gene
---
- Midnight : Bibi
---
I didn't downvoted this post btw
---
9 cause im coach cory and the glasses have a blue safe
---
I‚Äôm in

Pretty nice !
---
I literally got Max a minute after she was released
---
Yep. One in a hundred but the fact that it‚Äôs happening is a problem.
