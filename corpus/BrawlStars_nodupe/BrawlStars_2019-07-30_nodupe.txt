Thats like a few days of progress or weeks just down the drain
---
1) 800 is the new 500 so it's nothing but a transition.
---

---
They will prob add more ranks so tryhards could feel better about themselves.
---
2) it's not about a sense of progression, it was about getting your fav brawler to 500 and tilting.
---
3) "you lose half that every season" that was always the case lol, how did u not notice this before? Not to mention atleast now u get something out of it.
---
"Just to buy skins and boxes" well that's a good thing, and there will prob be other non cosmetic items.
---
Nice
---

"Just to get some useless skins" they are adding non cosmetics in the next update.

---
This is underrated especially for the quality of it
---
üò°
---
This is amazing
---
Which is why they made it easier to progress so u can actually get shit.
---
The end is near
---
If your comparison is getting to max level in an MMO vs getting a single skin, as far as I‚Äôm concerned you‚Äôve made my point. For a mobile game that speaks to a complete disdain for the players‚Äô time on the part of the publisher if not the devs themselves.
---
And you make so many assumptions to try to rationalize it, every one of which brings your estimates further from reality.
---
* most people don‚Äôt have all brawlers
---
* the goal of a matchmaking system is to find matches for which the expected win rate is 50% if possible
---
* most people don‚Äôt have brawlers at power level 10, which puts a soft cap on rank/trophy count
---
I play this game most days. But I don‚Äôt have every brawler (no legendaries) and I don‚Äôt have every brawler at rank 20. I don‚Äôt have ANY brawlers at power 10 (those prices are insane also). The season just ended and I think I got 78 star points?
---
And I‚Äôm pretty sure I play this game a little MORE or at least have been playing longer than the average.
---
From my perspective every one of these numbers is an insult.

Even before the change it was a fake achievement. It's a game. I feel good with my 500 even though I know it easier. Everybody else that I've talked to, that isn't trying to be super competitive or semi-pro is happy with their new 500s.
---
I get that you guys that put a lot more into it, and got better quicker than us, are pissed. And I get why after seeing a lot of comments. But that doesn't take away from our new joy, fake or otherwise. :)

# I SUPPORT THIS SHIP

Pro players who have contracts with e-sports companies will probably need to keep a high rank in the game. Since the new released progression system, it is very hard for pros to keep up with other pros who literally sleep, eat and brawl all day long. The only viable option was to leave the game...
---
How
---
# WAIT REALLY?!?! AWW HELL NAW!
---
When you're leading a shot, aim the bottle to where both ticks of damage will hit the opponent. Say they're walking right, aim your bottle to the right, but aim the left side of the radius of the bottle in front of them. 
---
When you're zoning an object or a path, block off the upper side of the object you're zoning. This will make enemies back away. 
---
If they're is an enemy next to you about to kill you but your super can kill them, use your super. You being out of the fight will make enemies feel more confident to push. Also, if you can, use your super at max range, wider coverage even though it pushes you back it will push the whole team back. 
---
Hope I helped :D
---
awesome

Rolling reload, He gains 3.0 ammo bar after using his super
---
I only play S SD and i find Crow to be the best. First brawler to 700 and way too good. With his star power, enemies are literally powerless and with no health as you keep poisoning them. Plus his speed is also handy
---
Honestly, I have to agree with Coach Cory. I mean when you roll to someone you ARE gonna make sure you have full health and ammo. Plus with the shield you actually have a chance against tanks.
---
huh?
---
Because I knew that the mortis will use his main attack to dash
---
Can i rework this?
---
Basically yeah
---
100% agree with u ...every time you roll at some one you will take a lot of damage and the shield is gonna make u  stay alive much longer  and if want to roll at the 2nd enemy but you should regain health and you will reload your ammo to
---
yes
---
Who asked you though?
---
It's good in boss fight.You can recharg your super then roll to a wall and to the boss again.
---
3000√ó6=18000 damage for one roll.With the Pam healing turret you can do dis in infinite Cuz the tanks will get the attention of robot while Darryl is destroying him.

It is 100% calculated

Look at my latest post
---
How is this bad matchmaking? You all had similair power levels and number of trophies. Supercell matched you with them again probably because you searched at the same time.
---
This is pretty satisfying to watch
---
They're going to give Screeching Solo the ability to charge super
---
Honestly a bad idea. 
---
First of all, it's too similar to Band-Aid, and with his health being higher than Shelly's he is going to be even more broken. 
---
Secondly, this will make his other star power very inferior to this one, thus no one will use the other Star Power.
---
He is Dyna God
---
What post are you talking about?
---

---
You just came here randomly and called me a 12 year old whitout saying anything else. So, what the fuck

Yeah because you're acting like an actual 12 year old.

How old are you then?
---
Really good, but I think his legs are short and stubby
---
r/im14andthisiswoooosh
---
Why would I tell you? You fucking wierdo
---
you probably would die facing him even as a mortis, he probably has more trophies on his dynamike than total trophies you do lmaoo
---
Well, we could balance it and put a few conditions for it to be activated so it‚Äôll be a bit high skill cap star power than steel hoops.  I know making him to heal up to 6000+ health could be a bit frustrating for other players so we could make it strong but not overpowered.

One team gets HUGE disadvantage because of indestructible wall
---
... I sense an amine watcher or a weeb

Or we could make it so that he charges his super around 25-30% faster? There are many ideas out there but we need to balance it out first.
---
This I beautiful! I can tell you put lots of effort into it! Keep it up
---
I was at level 1 and yeah of course I wasn't that good as I am today but they were even worse and I had no problem against them.

People always have a brawler that they prefer to play. Obviously, you should push all brawlers quite evenly, but at the end of the day you're always going to have a brawler that you enjoy playing the most, and that's what people call their "main".

I did this an hour ago
---
I know that but i just got shocked because i will never be able to do that
---
Thanks man!
---
Omg are you really lukiebear? You're my best brawlstars mento with CM
---
Ok
---
It was ironic
---
Not about to get r/whooshed
---
800 trophies* and used to give 400* 
---
What a Math nerd
---
My highest last season was 550 ish but, people at 1000 get reset back to 750, its not like they loose everything, they have the 250 trophies above the 500 too keep them going
---
Still can't make this üòì
---
Damn. I've got a long ways to go until that happens.
---
I can't either
---
Quality.
---
I did same with Mortis yay
---
r/itswooooshwithoutah

I CANNOT STOP LAUGHING IM SAVING THIS POST FOR SURE!

nice
---
This is gonna get deleted soon lmao
---
I guess el prinos
---
Thanks dude, I appreciate it
---
can i see proof
---
Yea
---
I like it but I want you to make an emotes idea new version so if you play colt you can just use colt emotes

No shit
---
In case you wondered why I deleted it, it's just because I misspeled a sub!
---
It doesn‚Äôt matter how many trophies you have. Mega boxes have set items that the give you.
---
I know, is a reupload
---
No emotes pls
---
Is blender a free program? It looks very similar to 3DsMax I'm kinda shocked
---

Used dumbass emote
---
Don‚Äôt forget to upvote!
---
A bad idea stolen from clash Royale
---
[Thats all]
---
Yeah that was pretty obvious.
---
shelly was is a legend
---
isn't the minimum age for Reddit 13
---
I could imagine a "sent present" thing like "I just need 10 more tokens to open this box, could you give it to me?" very well.
---
LoL
---
No proof needed
---
This is awesome!
---
r/uselessredcircle
---
Pls make leon
---
Well done! Well done.
---
I wanna waste my Tokens already! This thing will help me, you got my upvote
---
Thank you
---
I wrote a bad title beforeü§≠
---
If this were true
---
I feel like the heist map will be all luck... kind of like hot potato. The way you made the gem grab map more balanced than double swoosh should also be done to the heist map imo. Is there any way you can make it a little more balanced and not just luck? Thanks
---
Yeah but mortis since beta got like 100 nerfs
---
Thanks a lot, I really appreciate you
---
I was very surprised to see McDonald‚Äôs in here lmao! 
---
I really loved it though, even without said place. Keep making more!
---
Yes we absolutely need emotes i need to express my emotions

I like this idea! Only thing I want for emotes is to make them only viewable to your team (and add more team-based ones like **Pass the ball!**). Boom, now it's not toxic. üòé
---
BSS OLD MOD
---
Da
---
Yeah but still impressive üëç

Yeah, I bought mecha crow so I can save my star points for a future mortis skin

Brock is looking too, but the shades üò¢‚ò∫Ô∏è

Bull can literally 2 shot Shelly at max damage without letting her using Band Aid

the are the retropolis siege. I hope you enjoy

Is that DHMIS?

Verse, song?

Pretty accurate

This is really nice, you should color it!

At first I didn‚Äôt even know it was a video so I just got scared that the picture was moving lmao

Is this the reason why my post dies in new? Are they that bad??

Ah, this was just a way for me to draw hair and hats. I like it for it to look like it's like glass for see through to add a little bit of details. Hope you understand!
---
I've been trying to do this for the past fifteen minutes with not a single double jump.
---
That is one big map
---
Great work!!!
---
I like the idea but it looks unbalanced. Why didn't you go with double simmetry?
---
Lol that's why I said you have it worse. I only had 4 brawlers at 500. Poco around almost 700 before, Crow, Bo and Tara, barely above 500.
---
Go back on Instagram kid NORMIE
---
Rip
---
You got my upvote as well
---
oof
---
What?
---
no idea, I have 7k star points but don't have any brawler with 600, just a few with 500s
---
dad
---
finally, a good way to spend your star tokens. i just wanna see a "heal me poco" emote because no poco heals me
---
I think she is good. Low health and a range that isn't too much longer than brock's. Her movement speed isn't too fast either
---
Guessing you could have:

Sombra Leon

---
Not bad at all!
---
hOi
---
Thx üòã
---
Did you teach yourself how to use blender or were you taught it
---
I have Darryl's star power too , and it is ABSOLUTELY necessary for Darryl to be decent at all , it allows him to kill people much more easier , it is a great star power . Also , bull and primo still destroy him even with rolling reload , steel hoops at least helps him .
---
Looking at those 2 for actual gameplay advice was your first mistake
---
Pam-Zarya
---
I honestly feel like kairos is not even trying anymore, he‚Äôs a sellout now and he‚Äôs just saying whatever to get us to buy the new star powers, he almost always says the new star power is the better one and then he never forgets to say but make sure you buy both cause you might need them, not the same guy he used to be
---
r/lostredditors
---
you are evil
---
No offence but it looks like another version of mecha bo
---
Just walk towards her...
---
lukieeee op hiya
---
How can i link mine?
---
I say good play
---
Someone stated how to find legendary percentages, but if you want to optimize your chances I‚Äôll give a few tips. 
---
Anything in that info menu that has a percentage chance that clashes with legendaries (excluding power points and coins) will lower your chances of getting a legendary if you obtain it. For every box you open without obtaining a brawler or star power, your chances of obtaining them go up slightly. 
---
In order to have the best legendary chance, and have all other rarities unlocked, then you‚Äôll want to buy star powers from the shop instead as they can decrease your legendary chances. Or also simply keep your brawlers at level 8.
---
It's from the Brad Bolinder artstation.
---
He say " Here is Colt from Brawlstars. I had the pleasure of sculpting this as limited run for the game team at Supercell.  "
---
Me
---
And that why we nerfed him
---
I liked it
---
Yeah I‚Äôm at 8k and not even a single Mythic or legendary *sniff*

Are you... playing this on a PC somehow?

No
---
Tara-Zarya
---
(But Pam is bulky...)
---
That's the point. ;)
---
Where them chest muscles tho
---
Indeed...
---
Ima question mark ping just like in league just you wait /s
---
Cool! What a coincidence, i just got Leon today!
---
Those kameleon eyes cracked me up ü§£
---
It says this but after it says to connect by a Supercell ID
---
Seriously tho, primo looks smoother than smooth yoda
---
haven't played hearthstone in a long time
---
Her icon is already nice.
---
A lot of newer players can push Jessie to 600 easy because weaker players bunch up and she can dominate.
---
Very few Jessie's in games 600+ I see her in bb sometimes? Never anywhere else.
---
But noobs love to bush camp and spam AA with Jessie in bounty oh man üòÇ
---
Also 2nded the comment about jessie and the stats. It's just KTs app that shows all the data.
---
Very nice drawing
---
Maybe I got spike but still
---
What about the other sharpshooters, crow and Leon
---
here before it's on front page
---
that*
---
Why did supercell make this map
---
And cavern churn
---
Whoops forgot to edit my comment. I actually to watch it and realized he literally says that he's talking about competitive players and might make a future video for a casual. So I'm super wrong!
---
But I do agree that it's going to be great to use as Darryl. Just my style of play with him (read: amateur as fuck)
---
Sorry that I like the game in a different language? What? You know that sounds incredibly stupid what you just said.
---
K
---
All of those hormones are getting to him...
---
U wrong too
---
Pootis penser here
---
Thicco
---
He beat insane 16 with it
---
That‚Äôs what my self-conscious looks like tbh
---
I litteraly quit playing tara after the update just bc of the voice and ugly remodel
---
where‚Äôs the new skin
---
is no one gonna talk about the rockabilly mortis dancing on a mountain?
---
Primo should be pulling a moon behind him would be sick
---
Well
---
Where‚Äôs band aid Shelly with super at when you need her?
---
Eeee your also a gemmer
---
That's awesome!
---
Carl go back to  go look at thicc piper
---
Also rockabilly mortis on the mountainüòÇ
---
...I‚Äôm not sure I understand
---
Wow amazing
---
Many times since my mom threatens me with a flip flop to give her back her phone
---
Did you read the rest of what he said?
---
The p2w in brawl stars is not big, but it‚Äôs definitely there, u can buy all brawlers and max them out at 0 trophies, which surely gives you a huge advantage against others and that‚Äôs p2w
---
Looks really nice! Almost like a 3D render
---
If supercell will remodel leon
---
I wish they will give him herobrine eyes
---
Kirby was running with carl üòÇ
---
What‚Äôs even the point of getting both? I mean you‚Äôre only going to be using one of them
---
But im a gemmer and a very skilled player...
---
Or a really lucky skilled player who won the skin in a give away
---
Gem Grab: Double Swoosh but more unique
---
Split Paths: Can make some interesting gameplay with the two lanes instead of your traditional three lanes.
---
Death Valley: Cell Division but it‚Äôs bounty and there‚Äôs no jump pads :)
---
Where‚Äôd you get them though?
---
I'm also curious OP. I want them.
---
So it‚Äôll be called flying reload
---
I think it was Frank on Twitter.  I don't remember for sure though
---
Wait, there‚Äôs water at the top of that map?
---
so that they are more rare
---
Map very awesome!!
---
That crow will try to steal the meat
---
Why 3am
---
You deserve an award
---
It will take 3 seconds for the red team to reach for the middle, while the blue team needs to walk more than half of the map which probably will take 13 seconds dude do it symmetric
---
Maybe 50% od shelly's health?
---
r/imsorrynita

N √© very, √© tipo, this map is so awesome!

r/brawlstarsnextlevel

Ive always wished there were some sort of emots in the game.
---
Once you see it you can't unsee it.
---
No. No.
---
O your aproaching me? Instead of running away you are aproaching me
---
Maybe you could try pushing shelly/crow/leon to 500. Just look up some good maps for them and it will be easy
---
Dude ur dynamike has 3000 trophies or something like this lol
---
I like the idea but I don‚Äôt like the telling people to upvote part. Even I don‚Äôt do that
---
My Shelly is at 500 already, but Leon and crow are only rank 15. I‚Äôll try and rank them up
---
Spike looks too tall and leon‚Äôs face is lighter than his legs is what I have noticed and I tried to copy it from the game
---
hail grasa, hail Darryl xd
---
i cant beat the sh*t out of you without getting closer
---
wtf
---
The difference is everyone loves Mortis
---
Nope never got anything from the boxes in trophy road..
---
This is soo good !! ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
The holy collection
---
And you‚Äôd realistically be playing an assassin instead of a team-wipe, so the instant reload is kind of redundant
---
Don‚Äôt get it?
---
Thank you random citizen!

Only I think there's a small chance that u will be able to purchase brawlers with star points? Yes? But it's going to cost at least 80k lol

Why everybody hates new remodel?

FORGIVE MY SINS. Also I took it from chief pat we don‚Äôt have access to it

*they hated u/FalconFox500 because he told them the truth*

Aight bois let‚Äôs downvote him

This is just a bait to expose 12 year olds in this subreddit

I have 10k too but I recommend you to save them up, you never now what might come in the future?

So thats why NEVER UNMASK LEON
---
Jump&gt;Demo for higher skilled ppl; vice versa for lower skill
---
Uuuuummmm...

Good effort?

Then you realize you‚Äôre using Pam without new star power and it doesn‚Äôt kill it

Y tho? He works if you outskill the opponent

Just wow. I have an urge to add u

It was awful. If you think cavern churn is bad with teaming throwers, you should see hot maze. It can stay right where it is.

Sorry but this post is a joke. We all probably know that poverty and hunger is real hard sh*t we need to save. But opinions are welcome everywhere

I‚Äôve added boxes near every spawn and in between the teams at the corners to fix that XD you can zoom in on the photo to see the boxes
---
Throwers where complete cancer on this map
---
And gem grab remodel
---
Nope actually. It‚Äôs a huge coincidence. While making the maps I just tried to make every single type of brawler viable, and that was just the result. When people pointed it out I was shocked Xd
