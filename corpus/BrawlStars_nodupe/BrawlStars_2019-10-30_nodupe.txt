It's impossible to get a draw in heist. You can't have the exact percentage for both teams.
---
---
---
Where at?
---
Please Tomorrow I wait that for 1 week
---
Thank you
---
You¬¥re right.
---

---
I used my max Mortis(Creepy Harvest) and the three matches I lost them.
---
\*If you don¬¥t know Mortis is one of the best brawlers in the map\*

The fact that this garbage post gets 300 upvotes is just depressing.
---
I have 15, lost all matches cause of trash randoms. I don‚Äôt wanna describe them...
---
Goated
---
How this even happening?
---
Too true
---
Piper Calavera was Just an excuse to add female Poco into the game. Don‚Äôt @ me
---
Before watching I thought you were going to show yours and the other teams safe both being destroyed at the same time, if so that would have been cool. But yeah, as the other guy said, this is a common occorence because the draw is not done on the actual safe health, but rather the percentage of the health (Not tryna spread hate, but hope this helped).
---
Skins dont affect gameplay, theyre literally there for cosmetic purposes.
---
Just like you I‚Äôve climbed up to around that range almost exclusively with randomly only, I recently joined a club two days ago and just asked if anyone in there wanted to power play. That‚Äôs really all there is to it. You don‚Äôt know if they‚Äôll preform as well as you‚Äôd like but having a team comp you‚Äôre happy with helps.
---
Best artwork I‚Äôve seen yet üëè

I wonder how this "map" will actually play
---
[removed]
---
what is the problem IN DOING DAMAGE TO THE ROBOT AND IGNORE THE REST OF THE PLAYER
---
Let me guess, cavern churn and feast or famine?

im at 12k and im missing tara and all legendaries

Well I‚Äôm usually on around now everyday.

Everyone has their own definition of having fun. Some only have fun when they win, some are casuals who don‚Äôt really care they‚Äôre just here to kill time. You need to understand every person has a different perspective on things. Hope this helps.

Do you get any star points even if your not on leaderboard? Because if you don‚Äôt, all the top players are gonna be getting tons of star points lol
---
Wtf how
---
Its called "Rune" i think. Kairos made a few videos about it a while ago

---
Lol made me wanna buy calavera piper
---
true dat i made it in like 4 min. but i had to post something ...
---
Hm yes big sad mister i have a legendary and 4 brawlers lvl 9
---
Some people said that they played their 3 matches and ten played again with a friend, but Idk exactly how that works
---
But why..?
---
I never jump mid so i don't know about this..
---
Why Brawl Stars didn't edit this map before make it official..? :/
---
Stop complaining just be patient.
---
And thus Piper then sacrificed Poco into the candles to bring back life leech let Poco‚Äôs sacrifice never be forgotten
---
Yeap definitely! But I don't think they would be doing something like he mentioned like setting it to 0 then adding 3
---
During the brawlidays way back, the skins were discounted when they first came out, but I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs gonna be the case with these ones
---
THATS BEATIFUL!!!!
---
F lol
---
How did you make that
---
Thank you for the support, and thanks for the silver bro :)
---
Haha glad you really like him! I also really enjoyed him, thank you!

fuck u

Maybe haha, just a random name. Thanks for the support;

I‚Äôm at 12000 and got the last 2 mythical brawlers last month and only have 1 legendary the game is chance for boxes
---
Thanks! Sector did a really well job on him.
---
Yes but I don‚Äôt play him that much
---
Yes hopefully! Thank you :)
---
This isn‚Äôt porn.
---
Nice indeed.
---
Keep it at 69 comments
---
Haha sector did very good on that job skin!
---
Thank you :)
---
Thanks!
---
Thanks, and well, they're always taking stuff into consideration, you never know when our ideas could be added!
---
Yeah it was my bad on the late releasing, but yes glad you like it and supercell could use it for future updates!
---
BOOTLEG
---
U mean ‚ÄúBotany for the win‚Äù
---
She looking at the thiccness
---
Oh makes sense.
---
YES
---
Yeah I would really like something like the Halloween event to be added. I always enjoyed the thought of grinding to get things, really gives me a motive to play.
---
Thanks man!
---
Hopefully! Or maybe stuff like the Halloween event could be used for December ü§î
---
Welp, can't use those 499 unfortunately.
---
Yup!
---
Haha, so do I.
---
Did a Power Play match today as Barley... got paired with another barley. Such BS.
---
This is why the graveyard shift meta is ass. Tanks are completely useless in the mode
---
r/lootstars , this will get downvoted here, but upvoted there. Also don't use the "event" flair, that's obnoxious.
---
Goodbyen't
---
For a second I though the watermark was part of the map

Everything

What fixes? please specify not just brainlessly complaining
---
Who wouldn't glare at a blet if they could?

Even in text you can‚Äôt understand him
---
Yes I auto-aimed, I'm sorry
---
One night witch, but still.
---
Where where you at summer break when this got added?
---
*invisible Leon swipes it while they try and camp it
---
So if your total trophy at 18000 and then you use a new brawler that you just unlocked, you will experience level 1 brawler againts level 10 brawler. They use matchmaking by Brawler Trophy for a reason, not a brainless concept
---
right

You're that guy that's making us 10k+ brawlers lose

good

I have no words

You take stuff way too seriously that sub is mainly a joke.

What

I don't have a single legendary. Even after reaching 11k.

Got ‚Äôem both

Yes yes i know i mest up on the 2 jump pads but i hope you get the point

Does this mean poco will now be forced to pocket Piper? Plz say yes!

1k Max Level Shelly is a hard thing
---
Too far away, will probably come out on Halloween. Not a bad idea though.
---
Yep, please Supercell!
---
If banning is too much atleast give them a warning!!
---
Max Level Shelly reach 1k is hard, imagine doing with level 1. OMG
---
Sure why not
---
teaming is bad and i hate it too but somebody reported it and system files as well as a dev said that its a risky strategy but it is fair. Idk if ryan knows about it but somebody did posted it on reddit and if u could give me link  pls do and unfortunately ryan like devs are with us but some devs think teaming as a strategy
---
Why did this comment got downvoted so much?
---
Big brawler ...
---
Dude I had the same question considering that I dont have that skin yet
---
Wouldn't be too late though
---
I feel this pain
---
Shelly wants something more
---
Well cr used to be like that
---
I feel so bad for you
---
Or they could‚Äôve been in a very badly thought out team.
---
Teaming Is an op strategy that can't be nerfed that's why people don't like it
---
r/thebrawlstarscactus
---
I got all from big and brawl. Nothing good from mega.. the irony tho
---
And they say it all went downhill from there...
---
I also do that
---
Did peoples stats reset wheb Emz came? Stats for chanses of getting a new Brawler?
---
i got 26 of my brawlers from regular boxes only bibi was from mega box
---
This brings a huge smile to my face for some reason :)

Can I use this as a meme templateüòÅ

I found a rat near bush

There is a reason he's smiling like that üòè

meet the one who cuases blast under and over the sea mine scape. He's a new blasting brawler and he's only RARE. Original I was gonna make him trophy road 9000trophys but ehh I changed it.
---
He throws out mines at his enemies and watches them get blasted away and watch for his super it's a devastating blow that keeps moving when throw but slowly and doesn't have much time to.
---
#Quotes: he has a kinda scartchy calm low chill voice kinda like a hippie.

I played as primo in my team. We won 2 out of three because poco attacked the first time. Ez dubs. Memes a lie.
---
MOODY BLUES
---
Not a bad idea, maybe the price should be higher since you can get coins a lot faster than gems. Maybe 800-1000 coins? (Special offer for 700 coins)
---
Yeah I can see that thanks
---
CHECK OUT MY GUNS HAHAHA

It's really simple, all you need is a ton of free time, luck, patience, and good bush hiding skills

Ofc

This is real guys, check the global leaderboards for Shelly.

me too

spike or sandy. spikes damage is high, he deals poke damage and he can deal with most brawlers. sandy had a nerf so can't say how strong it is now but he was very strong last season

I got leon and crow from brawl boxes on the same day
---
Its so easy to erase the bg. The floor in showdown is all the same color no gradients
---
Got tara yesterday from normal box
---
That is scary one... and good. Have my upvote!
---
The idea is great, but its not hard to put power cubes with Photoshop
---
Yep, more Star Tokens a day means more Big Boxes. And I'm not complaining for more free stuff.
---
Haha me too
---
In brawl box i get spike and mortis
---
Please don‚Äôt shake the camera
---
Ah, very funny, I laughed.
---
Even at 700 trophies there are these kind of trolls. Only at 800+ trophies then players know what they're doing
---
i think you should be able to get skins in boxes
---
Watch out man r/genegang might raid you
---
Do a lvl 1 rank 35 next!
---
When you realise that this is your friend and he forced you to share your brawler idea before you get your other friend to draw you a good drawing
---
You look really good and delicious!
---
Anyways, I agree that this makes them not want to use the star, but there is always a downside of using something really powerful. One good example in Brawl Stars itself is that Carl's Super shortens his range
---
okay i agree with that but star powers probably shouldnt
---
XDDDD
---
Why not? It'll be interesting wouldn't it?
---
hmm maybe this would work IF BRAWL STARS LET US UNEQUIP STAR POWERS
---
It's supposed to be a Nintendo Switch ü§£
---
But yeah it look like a smartphone üòã
---
Thx üïπ
---
No it‚Äôs the players fault
---
True I guess. Then add that to the update
---
isnt it poco cuz of pipers new skin
---
How did you get the shelly thing?
---
Nah spike was my first
---
Well right now no new account can get it soooooo
---
The exact same thing happened earlier to me. People like this need to be stopped
---
r
---
I will use this meme
---
Lol, now I can't unsee this forever.
---
It was a litle tournament thing about solo wins, i onlly saw OJ promoting on his chanel, i entered and got 3rd place
---
Amm no, but I can buy them if it's worth it
---
The account is 2 days old
---
There's a thing called the shop
---
Supercell removed that after everyone abused it
---
Were is this from
---
Is this his main account or just a mini? GG in both anyways
---
YOU ARE A FREEKIN LEGEND SEND THIS TO SUPERCELL
---
It breaks the game, unlike the double glitch in friendlies which is useful for stuff. And breaking the game can lead to...
---
A ban
---
But it is quite rare to find a player who got that. I mean, VERY RARE. So if you have already done your 3 battles there is no way to get your 4th onr
---
And that's a fact!
---
Do you got something bro? :D
---
Depends on the map but snappy sniping since it's more versatile.
---
This is kinda irrelevant but I like the artwork
---
1250 is the gold you need to upgrade from 8 to 9
---
So thats where i remembered it from
---
Sorry, I shouldn't have used the word 'rules', but more 'standards'. The standards of how a game is stable are different today than it was 15-20 years ago. I've been working in the industry since 11 years now. Was just trying to inform you. But you do not want to understand. Let's agree to disagree then. Have a nice day
---
No!
---
Like I said, HIS BATTLE LOG says otherwise. You can go see for yourself.
---
Kk
---
Dude you unlocked all the more common ones, of course you're going to get fewer.
---
I would to buy spike skins, but I Don't have spike xd
---
Tf... I'm at 10k and I only have 3 brawlers at lvl 9, no star power yet, but I'm missing sandy spike and leon
---
Brawl Stars 2 is here ma bois
---
You'll get him eventually buddy, pray to the rng god and he will deliver
---
I got my first mega right before the trophy one
---
Leon: im bouta end this mans whole career
---
Power drink Piper with 3 powercubes:*It's Show Time*
---
i think that there are a lot more but that they didnt win that much
---
No this is a great offer
---
Supercell literally broke takedown. You spawn MILES away from the boss. When you reach the boss it has immune shield, it shoots chain lightning at you giving you low hp and then a thirsty colt just kills you and its literally like a cycle
---
Either he plays a ton and is just awful or he‚Äôs spent money.
---
OH MY GOD THIS IS THE BEST FAN-ART ON REDDITüòç
---
Yeah..........
---
For gem grab it is sad truthüò§üò§üò§üò§
---
Siehst du klappt ja. Es braucht nur etwas Zeit &amp; Gl√ºck mehr isses nich. Bis auf die Legend√§ren kann man wirklich alle relativ easy bekommen.
---
Later as coach cory sort by new
---
Woah this looks creepy. But dope!
---
Nice.....
---
wow suba
---
Some people are just very good.
---
Power Play started yesterday, the max you could possibly get yesterday was 99 points, the max you can get today is 114 points I believe, so very good players can get up to 213
---
Plus some players were able to play through a glitch 4 times instead of 3, so some very good players managed to have 4 wins so get up to 126 points yesterday and 114 points today
---
Yeah this is a very cool showdown map hopefully it gets added into the game
---
Never buy brawlers with gems its not worth it get coin booster or doubler whatever you wanna call that or buy skins thats what i do.
---
Whatya smoking there girl?
---
And but skins only in discount
---
I got alot of teamate with 500 tropies for a brawler but when i check their profile their tropies is only 3k they play so badly that they dont know how to dodge a shot over all i think the overall tropies count
---
Wow you guys get really creative making pictures out of maps, Or is it maps out of pictures? Hurts my brain.
---
It‚Äôs a mortar
---
Hm. When I play, the people that have lots of power cubes die quickly around the boss because everyone wants to kill them.
---
Thanks
---
Oof 26/30 
---
Is it the legendaries?
---
Yeah exactly and it's always the colts, pipers and jessies who deliberately kill them...
---
Im going to buy it but who should i give it to, piper or bibi?
---
So this is it, thanks for sticking with my account, ever since i was a nobody, playing some Shelly, yeah, this is it, it's been an adventure, It's the end of reign of Bruno Miguel's account. Through all the power play trophies, you've been by my side, There's no army in the world I would rather give me brawl time,  It's been a wild ride, so while I can still be heard, here's one last post, from the number one in the world...
---
I just unlocked sandy like literally 1min ago
---
Yeah but if you just stay away from the high power cube people and those colts and pipers etc then you‚Äôll be fine
---
You are forgetting abou a lot of thing... boxess also have chance of droping  gems, tickets, token doubler, star powers, unlock new brawlers...  the ticket offer is way better than this one. 
---
If you unlock 1 SP on this 99  boxes you have more 2000 gold on this math...
---
Buying straigh PP and gold doesn't give you a chance on anything extra
---
Maybe it counts but it isn't the priority. Top priority for matchmaking is still brawler trophy count
---
I wish SuperCell sold these
---
The guy in the video is CanYaDigIt
---
oooooooh. makes sense now
---
Those 1000 IQ plays.
---
‚ÄúWelcome to Tick airlines hope everyone has a safe flight today‚Äù
---
that poor person who got last getting only 2 points, penny is not good in rockwall brawl
---
Thanks alot
---
Ok?
---
Cuz u lost too many trophies
---
Well, BinnyBoy beated Brunos Miguel. He had 4 epic wins and 3 first place, I think. However, Yde wasn't too lucky in his power play. He only has 169.
---
And jessies
---
How do you perform this glitch though?
---
mm?
---
Matchmaking
---
Why? he's just trying to make other people happy.
---
Ah yes that is a lot of bonus Tokens
---
I like the anime frustration  thingy you made on mortis
---
Looks like 'royal tribute'
---
I got all brawlers from boxes 
---
From mega boxes SHIT
---
OMG, that‚Äôs awesome!
---
it actually is.
---
No I looked at the map then I wanted to see for myself, so I joined a friendly game and there it was.
---
The map is Not So Safe.
---
Imagine him running after you. I bet mortis would be scared.
---
Good work tho.
---
Join the club
---
As if it wasnt broken already... Everyone was happy including me when 2 New modes were introduced... 2 more star tokens... Yay... That i can never achieve because of the shit meta and the broken mode... So im there as if there was no TD or LS.... But at least i get 10 star tokens a day... Lucky me
---
But not playing a certain brawler does not mean he won't know how to counter another brawler
---
BinnyBoy
---
Im in love with the map. Theres so many options for trickshots!
---
Heh, my star power is colts ‚Äúslick boots‚Äù currently
---
And the same situation repeated right now, that colt got 10th and I got 7th, -6 trophies ffs
---
I didn't get any offer, can you show what is the value and what it gives?
---
I recently got sandy I feel he is trash right now
---
I‚Äôm guessing you died from the dank after it cuts or something
---
Yea it does that was my point
---
Dang they have the old Dynamike...I miss that boi.

Brawl stars 2??

Brawl stats
---
I also accidentally played my rank 1 power 10 Rico twice in Gem Grab, so now I'm rank 3. I will no longer look as impressive as before.
---
Matchmaking queue took 3-4 seconds for these games.
---
it is not like queue waiting time was too long so the matchmaking decided to bring any player. 
---
and when this happens it should not still bring brawl with level 1 and more than 400 trophies difference!!!
---
Tara
---
Actually i won the game
---
SUPERCELL is actually bulling that kid üòÇ see he has only 5 gems

So satisfying

yde is the master.

;_; everyone hates me no but for real I just wanted to post this but the only place I could was brawl stars also can you not be a douche about it not being about brawl stars I bet there are other posts on the brawl stars subreddit that are not about brawl stars and they probably don't get smack talked because people like them more I mean HOOOOOOOOWWW ORIGINAL üòí
---
Potential for the Monica T Pose Meme?!
---
Good idea. Today I play tara in brawlball and my enemy was D_e_s_P_e_R, he has 26 thousands trophies. I have 11k
---
Oh hey its you
---
There is no need to post the same thing 3 times
---
I play Piper alot on takedown n only kill people if they shoot at me... N then I completely hunt for them the whole match out of spite
---
Most popular, but if you look at the stats, the active COC accounts are gradually decreasing. Well up to you to decide if it's P2W, but compared to Brawl Stars, COC is not really a F2P friendly game. There's a lot of structures to upgrade and when you haven't finished upgrading to max, a new TH appears
---
Guy, its nice!
---
Idk about anyone else but usually I see colts attacking other brawlers, I usually try to just ignore anyone else but i won‚Äôt let the opportunity to kill someone who does this pass me by.
---
Romani de Romaaaaaa üòÇ

Me too

I did it accidently

I‚Äôm just really horrible at it.

ah darn, it's a feather duster
---
Yeh
---
I saw this format before but not the meme so yeah
---
I keep trying to convince myself half these self-defeating idiots simply haven't gotten past auto-aim. Around 500 trophies it's actually Pams I keep getting frustrated by!   
---
Feels so stupid being killed 2-3 times by someone and all they've achieved is keeping you both in 8th-10th position...
---
It's insane
---
The nita is not much but still it would be so dope if its just shelly
---
That's a rare sight! 
---
Or maybe at very high trophies like 900
---
You dare oppose me mortal? FEEL MY WRATH

Looking good Binney. To those wondering how he did this: he‚Äôs really good at showdown :D
---
What does it even do
---
Yep 1billion percent
---
I didnt notice it was power 1. But otherwise shelly isn‚Äôt difficult getting into high levels
---
I hit it like 7 times a week xD because I play 4-5 hours a day
---
u/oh-yeah-mikey ,see his post there
---
Shelly of course
---
Late spawns and server lags EPIC
---
Is this a non maxed out account offer I‚Äôm too maxed out to be able to get?
---
We need more of these
---
Thank you!
---
Yeah, the still prefer the old Takedown. Immune shield just encourages thirsty colts, piper and jessie to attack other brawlers. Some people who know how to play Takedown even got affected since they would only want to deal damage to the boss but gets taken out immediately by those thirsty colts.
---
Riiiiip what level?
---
Haha
---
Well sorry man I didn‚Äôt know
---
OOPS! Forgot to write that Super charges in FIVE hits, like Nita
---
u/oh-yeah-mike sorry dude
---
am i the only one that has less than 100 points today?
---
piper, jessie, crow

guarantee playing take down as show down in every match

Hello, i am mortis

Ticks head tara shadow and nita bear always have around like 1 sec before they start moving or attacking. Thus Ticks head did not move even though it should have. Same glitch for Bibi bat knockback

Replace "drew" with "f*ck" and drawing with "f*cking" and it gets a lot weirder

That‚Äôs a good idea. With out that they would be getting reports like ‚Äú this random was really dumb so he should be banned‚Äù

Nice work, im working also at a gun, penny's gun, if i will had left more Cardboard i had in mind to make the most scary object that exist:LARRY THE CANON
---
Still better then lone star though
---
At the last moment
---
Howdy
---
I think the shield is fine. If I‚Äôm far away at the start I just focus on cubes because when I get to the boss it‚Äôll be shielded.
---
Bing bong your opinion is ching chong
---
It's not so cringe ... Supercell does pay2win games, let's face it, but it doesn't affect the game that much. In addition, legendary brawlers have  a little hp. I mean Shelly can kill them with her super up close
---
You forgot Spike, Brock and Pam

Who told u?

Who is bruno miguel and why is he a meme?
---
How many brawlers?
---
Yes, its true, supercell doesn't want a different gamemode which is still showdown but only just the game environment, i believe it will become a random environment for showdown like life leech b4
---
luck maybe
---

Sorry but i think what it's you're worst art!

Reading this, you literally just copied someone‚Äôs idea I saw a week ago. exactly the same buffs except for the box. Nice try

it is...

The left half really needs some work
---
Has anyone seen werewolf Leon or the new piper skin?
---
It gets harder from 700 and above. Pushing my Jessie from 700 to 750 took way longer than from 500 to 700

Yup, for new players :)

Yup, they look cool, my favourite one's Piper ‚ù§

Yeh I understand, I was merely suggesting it. But u game for having a match with me?

Now he can fuck jessie harder and beat el primo to death oh god oh fuck
---
play her and you'll understand.

Congrats! I also got him 5 days ago.

Hmmmm.... HMMM

And then destroy them (leon, rosa, sandy and probably emz)

They will keep on spamming you from the back, only for random brawlers to come and finish you off. They never get a kill, or a brawler's powercube, and will rarely if ever get Rank 6 and better.
---
it equals to 89.4 brawl box. 10% less than ticket one but still pretty good as there is no grinding involved.

Yes I know, but I hate it when people ask for upvotes. It is hated for the community as well. Delete the "Do'nt forget to UPVOTE" section and I will change it to an upvote. It will get more upvotes from other people as well.

It‚Äôs a bit presumptuous to say this will happen for sure when Supercell (Frank I think?) said whether or not it stays depends on how much it‚Äôs played, and based on matchmaking speeds I‚Äôm reasonably sure it‚Äôs not as if it‚Äôs been a flop by any means. There‚Äôs no guarantee it stays and I‚Äôm not *expecting* it to, but I‚Äôm not *expecting* it to go away either.
---
I lost three times because of teamers

I dont think that the position killed frank

You stoled it from me

You're right in any way ;)

She's aiming at Joe

Depends on range

He still has nine seconds of invisibility and his star powers are both at least decent. It‚Äôs not as if he‚Äôs bad.
---
Crow is the best

Rico op

You forgot to post your Original Brawler, SuperSonic the Wedgehog. Include his stats and super plus an MS Paint picture if him.
---
What clan is he in
---
when u know ur meme isn‚Äôt funny but u put gedikor‚Äôs name in it to get upvotes
---
It was fixed in one way automatically. He played four games and had -1 left. So he probably only played 2 the next day (today).
---
I had a Barley star power offer pop up this morning, pulled it out of a box. Then, I upgraded El Primo to level 9, and one of his star powers popped up in the shop right after. Supercell wants those gems today!
---
It's pretty frustrating. I had to 1v3 2 Shellies and a Nita, like wtf am I supposed to do there?
---
Yea...

Oh you added icons for power play?

For the people who thought the account belongs to me.

Someone got a lvl 1 Shelly to 1000
---
IS THAT LEX
---
How is it equal to 89.4 brawl boxes? isn't it just extra 14 boxes? as you need 100 tokens for one box so 1400 tokens = 14 extra boxes
---
Why do I fell like this involves the play again button cuz I've done a glitch where I played robo rumble with no tickets by spamming the ready bottom so quickly it let me play and then payed me out the same amount as the last game which h was basically free 15 tickets
---
Yes like two Shelly's with band aid ant seven power cubes I was a Leon with one they literally two shot me

Glad I'm not the only one that feels this way, though, honestly I was expecting a flood of "pro" players coming to tell me how teaming is a viable tactic and I just need to get good at it. FFS.

r/LootStars
---
It‚Äôs a good idea, but I really don‚Äôt like it. It‚Äôs generally that certain brawlers become much more annoying, like Gene. Downvote me if you want, but the brawlers I leveled for showdown like Shelly aren‚Äôt as viable anymore, and it doesn‚Äôt suit my play style of camping out and waiting for others to kill each other.
---
This was a joke of you, wasn‚Äôt it?
---
talking about something completely unrelated to what Frank is saying, why not. if you do this, you are no better than the kids that comment "fre skin bral tak when??" under every video. it will take a while for them to fix that, they might have to completely revamp the game, or go into a very long maintenance break. I don't think anybody wants to have a maintenance break during Halloween, where every other competent game gets some sort of themed content. this update was a very good one, be grateful for it.

Graveyard shift will be ded i think
---
This is a funny one...
---
Most annoying thing about this game mode is this! There are times when you need to take down a brawler but if you are only attacking brawlers get out of here with that!
---
If that were to happen I think it would extend to about 2 maybe even 300 players who get this reward as it is very easy to the with someone

Well said, it‚Äôs a fun novelty, but it‚Äôs just too hard to win consistently and it‚Äôs generally much more annoying to get cornered in this mode than normal showdown where you stand a fighting chance.

How can anyone like takedown after the newest change?? I liked to play it before, but now that they have given the boss that immunity, it ruined the gamemode for me...everyone was already complaining about people attacking each other and not the robot so WHY THE F did they make him immune...and when he is, everyone stars attacking each other of course because they cant damage the boss, and then when I get killed by a high powercube guy I spawn in the corner of the map again and by the time I come the the boss...HES IMMUNE AGAIN...such a stupid change imo.
---
P.S Because of that, the games in takedown last longer and before they were really short and I liked that ALOT...anyone else feels the same or am I the only one?
---
Yup, Tommorow ;)
---
Rip mortis, ‚¨á he only got 2 skins which counts as skins, they are ok tho.
---
he got spike, crow and sandy from regular box.
---
xDDDDD...
---
This looks amazing!
---
Bro????
---
I was just playing Piper in Takedown and attacking the boss instead of other players, and she's really good.
---
Same thing happened to me, 1st legendary was Leon a week ago, f2p at 14.5k at the time.
---
Why can‚Äôt you just let people use reddit how they want to
---
Wonder full made
---
They have 700 gem legendary offers in the shop whenever they release new legendary

Yeah thats very to do with mortis...I always do it but not on this map. I do it on double trouble

First look was thereüòÅ

Isn't 6 second is actually Leon's? It is Sandy who got nerfed from 12 to 9s.

Cool, have an upvote :)

Finally Leon has a real reason to turn invisible

Me too two days ago, but i didn‚Äôt posted because nobody cares

r/foundthemobileuser

I mean at that point he must since there will be another team of 4 teaming against him and trophy system will push you down a bunch if u get a low spot. It also wasn‚Äôt organized but he teamed a lot so it is still frowned upon
---
Piper...why is everyone saying shelly, even if shelly has super, she cant do anything because she doesnt have range, and piper does.
---
ü§î
---
What if there were no star powers/everyone bumped down to lvl9 when playing the mode, kinda like a tournament standard in CR
---
Yea but still the effect of suprise
---
Yeah, because its overrated xD and overused too... :)
---
If you think so, youre probably a noob at 1k...you never heard of RANGE?? Yeah with range and with aim, piper wins easily.
---
1. it means "**a** good idea..."
---
2. it isn¬¥t a good idea because p2w

Holy shit u lucky

My phone dont run Graveyard Shift :(

why not have an offer that for 10000 gems you get every brawler, man you lame
---
I hate this jerks of emojipolice,why can't anyone use emote if they want to express themself
---
I gues

But the post was piper vs shelly not bull vs shelly...piper wins of course, because she has range.
---
Lol i made pretty much the exact same meme a while ago
---
i also relized that it¬¥s really confusing

Yeah with gems i got, i saved for so long for it

I , maby also even supercell will be more than proud of this

I don't understand why is Piper OP in this mode?  I can understand Barley, Tick, Crow... or Gene, Poco in duos... but Piper? and nobody mention Pam?

Dragon jessie is the better for me

I liked the old one, but I prefer this one (I pushed my dinamike to 1000 trophies so I know that the games used to last like 50 seconds). The immunity of the robot makes it harder because people start killing each other and give you time to reach to the boss. I also prefer the lasers, specially the ones that bounce like Jessie shots

I wish I knew but I dont... gave you an upvote so its 0 again :)

Round boi
---
There is a difference of about 200 trophies per team. Matchmaking is not done on total trophies, it is on brawler trophies, stop complaining, it pairs you up with people who are as good with their brawler as you are with yours. Having 15k doesn‚Äôt mean you are a master at using piper, nor having 3k means you are shitty with colt

I guess you missed the part in the picture where I‚Äôm playing with a 600 brawler and being matched with a 130 brawler. And that is what the complaint is about. Being matched with players that ARE NOT as good with their brawler as I am with mine, but allowed in the game when other people bring them along.

Not flexing, just saying it‚Äôs possible to get it done, and if I were to flex I would‚Äôve done it w my trophies
---
Yeah he is still a really good brawler and at s tier probably but why is that a reason to hate him? Literally such a nonsense...
---
1, Crow is only balanced because counters like 8-Bit are very prominent in the meta. If his counters get nerfed, Crow would infest almost every gamemode.
---
2. Legendary means more fun or unique, not necessarily stronger. Rarities only affect the strength of characters in certain games. Brawl Stars is not one of them.
---
Lol I play as crow and tbh he can be too op cause I k.o anyone regardless if they are like a Frank or Rosa if I use my super
---
Hey, i did that too https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/b6g37f/they_said_it_couldt_be_done/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share

3√ó5=15

Awk how did you find me

But the match ends in 10 seconds and it's 1:0

Hawwwwww

I will suck your toes if ur right

So there was a Barley, now there's Dynamike, and Mortis next. Did you forget about Tick or ws he already killed by Mortis?

Nice try but reddit mobile highlights actual subreddit links now

10k is still alot though I'm only at 800 or so trophies.

No, the real reason why those modes gets more players is because it's hard to get the star tokenüòÇ
---
Me too! Sandy and crow
---
Yes, mortis executed him. Or maybe tick used his super. Idk
---
She is very fun on graveyard shift
---
Well my problem when i play Leon is trying to get my super charged. Those shurikens are pretty useless unless you're really close to an enemy. I feel they should buff those, not the invisibility

Ike cant see people in bushes so it would be completely unfair i guess
---

A little bit to relaxing song for this F game, but i like it
---
it is funny since the frank brawler dev said that people play normal showdown instead of graveyard shift, which means that your opinion is still popular
---
It's so satisfying to be penny and stand in front of a box and kill a tank with dealing over 3k per hit
---
You have said this on so many posts, this is the second time in a damn row. Try changing it to Definition- someone who has not paid any money to the game. That would be more accurate
---
I also DISLIKE the slurp energy drink modifier now. Its stale and boring and it is the same maps that have them. Like I'm tired of a shellies who has been camping all game just to kill me instantly when I've been getting lots kills and putting the actual work in.

What frank means, matchmaking take way longer for those modes

Ok
---
You are very welcomed :))
---
No one in their right mind would spend gems for coins (at least I know I wouldn't). Also I'm just saying it's easier and way more valuable to wait and get your star powers in brawl boxes. I don't think I'd even pay 50 gems for a star power tbh.

Sandy‚Äôs new super can push brawlers where ever he points his super. It‚Äôs not hard to understand. He can push them in 4 directions, up down left right. Right now his main attack doesn‚Äôt have any synergy with his current super. His current super is also  boring and sandy is a legendary brawler so he should be able to do something cool.
---
Blue, not rich
---
Red, RICH!
---
You're right, it should be a modifier of the normal showdown.
---
And the maps should be the graveyard maps üëª for the duration of the modifier.
---
Spam crow to win
---
r/perfectloops
---
Like what?
---
basically what made the game mode an absolutely trash
---
The meta is interesting. There are two starpowers for every brawler now. Try maxing out the brawlers you play most first. Crow and Piper are very strong, as well as spike with curveball. 8bit is decent but slow. Emz is a pain, but not OP, at least not to me. And Sandy is still pretty good even after several nerfs. Nita got buffed and is decent now. Poco with his new star power is fairly good as well. We have brawl ball as a permanent slot. We also got life leech back, but it's now called Graveyard shift. We also have three other game modes. The first one is Siege, where you collect more bolts than the opposing team to create a robot. This robot helps tank and helps destroy the other teams base. We also have takedown, a solo game mode where brawlers compete to see who can deal the most damage to the boss. We finally have Lone star. Which is like bounty, but it's a solo game mode as well. Takedown and Lone Star rotate every other day. We also have a endgame mode called Power Play. You can gain points, on a leaderboard. Your goal is to get as many points as possible. And you can only use brawlers that are max and have their star powers. I'd recommend a team for Power play. It's more competitive, and harder to play with randoms. Those are all of my tips, hope they help.
---
Piper in French
---
put the account of this men in video
---
they just added a competitive mode for maxed brawlers with star powers
---
This makes no sense
---
And i am... u/XFlameBrawlStars
---
Yeah never mind
---
Yea, a modifier of normal showdown.
---
with just graveyard maps for the duration ;)
---
No joke the only reason I‚Äôm not playing graveyard shift is due to the ghost look. It makes it harder for me to see or somethings off about it
---
Stolen
---
Shelly and Bull are duo'ing
---
I mean; it is n i c e that you unlocked it
---
I said all so including brawl stars
---
It is called teaming and supercell has not added a feature to report teaming.
---
read showdown instructions in support section. you'll find out that teaming is allowed ü§¢
---
Right cuz doesn't exist piper and brock right.... also gene is a support and he has the highest range ingame
---
I have the exact same in my shop lol
---
That sounds broken as fuck. It wouldn‚Äôt even be able to be balanced too well. He is only meant to be more of a support-fighter brawler, so his super is good.
---
Not every brawler has to have their abilities match. How would Poco‚Äôs abilities match?
---
WannaHaveABadTime?
---
Wait really? Oops never mind then

Piper in French, I forgot to translate sry
---
He stole it

Don‚Äôt steal

Cya in hot

he can

Yeah now he seems more like an epic than a legendary

Welcome in Takedown, friend

.....That‚Äôs just Magnificent !!!You should continue posting art with other Brawlers too!
---
When I was starting out with EMZ and had like 40+ trophies I got paired up with people at 200-300 and no I wasn't in a team. Guess matchmaking is retarded sometimes
---
This Poco was like: Oh you missed? Don't worry, I will help you :)
---
If u get hit by a piper bullet you're pretty much dead. Pretty obvious?

I up if you gift me skin !!

why did they even change his name, Was it really that long

Not until you asked

I‚Äôd like to inform you that Nita, leon, and sandy are all minors, and i think a few other brawlers are as well
