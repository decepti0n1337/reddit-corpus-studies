That is Lowkey a good idea to have tiny islands of 1-2 tiles then all water and you only can play Darryl
---
You should do a bigger hat for him
---
What?
---
Ok?
---
This needs more upvotes
---
What about gold one?
---
An 8
---
At lower trophies, that’s REALLY easy
---
so funny 😂😂😂😂
---
and yes report system indeed
---
Yeah that's true but this isn't even a cool clip like in all of my games in bounty a huge comeback as good as this happens around 20% of the time because the game mode is specifically designed to allow comebacks to occur because of the star system. Something like this has probably happened to you as well, but you just aren't remembering because it wasn't even that exciting
---
Ah Kill it
---
Why do I see this picture moving
---
*Rosa has entered the chat*
---
This was posted earlier today
---
It depends on the brawler, if they waste all 3 and their recharge is slow, then they fight with only two attacks instead of a full 3 I get annoyed.
---
Nice. I got mortis like 5 minutes before I watched this
---
What in the absolute frick, what curse have you brought upon this land?

U think I don’t?

Since your telling him to grind more and that u bragged about having 10k trophies when you had 19 brawlers... yes I think you don’t

Nice trickshot

I’ve played for over a year to get this many trophies...
---
I quote “when I had 19 brawler”
---
r/crowgang
---
That was...how dare you.
---
Kinda like gene, Poco, and Pam, huh?
---
supercell removed it but it's standing strong it don't want the remove hammer lol
---
Oh, when you put it that way, 500 is enough
---
Who needs new Brawlers when you main your favorite one unless you’re a trophy grinder who likes every brawlers balanced..
---
Yea so???
---
scatter to 2 pennies and shoot 1 pennies with cannon
---
i like the idea about slippery surface
---
p.s. i just expressed my opinion on the internet
---
I like playing for fun, I don’t really want to get on the grind. I literally only play showdown and ticket events with the occasional gem grab if i’m feeling confident
---
Okay we all have different play styles. U do what u like and yea...
---
Perfectly balanced
---
Me too, I remembered today.

Look at his spike trophies: he's dropping trophies for purpose.

Did I? Thank you for pointing that out, I'm too lazy to change it but it's good to know I messed that up

This is good but I feel like ice spike would be better since then he can launch a ball with ice shards

&amp;#x200B;
---
EEEEEEEEEEEL
---
fuck no
---
It’s to drop trophies so they play against lower trophy players, not for troll lol
---
To be fair most mobile games are that simple. Take even a complex MOBA like Vainglory for example, all you do is move, tap, and use abilities. Simplifying game mechanics like you’re doing isn’t fair to the game. If you went a step further you could just say “all I do is tap on a screen!” Which is true, but doesn’t represent gameplay at all.
---
I completely agree and it’s why I always use showdown to push brawlers from 0-300. I seriously hope the devs can fix showdown because it’s the most played game mode atm
---
I think thats a trolling but whatevs
---
Teaming to agree not to kill each other is understandable especially when you will very easily get 3rd partied. Team roam killing is bs

I feel like we need another batch of mods.  I have seen this get away more than I could remember.
---
Ha
---
They dont have much endgame content becuase most of the people playing the game are not that far into the game and, they dont need to prioritize it.
---
Plus yashuhiro smokes weed for 30 percent of the day
---
They said they added system to ban these game throwers (no not Dynamike and barley) but that was few months ago 
---
All games have trolls
---
Have you been playing since beta?
---
Whose birthday was it , because the only time you ever have cake is when it's someone's birthday
---
yup
---
They did said they are looking into try to ban these ppl but that was few months ago in beta
---
😂
---
They said they will look into it to ban them but that was few months ago in beta

nIcE pIeCe Of WoRk
---
I think an option to choose a second star power could fix this, also make brawlers like piper more versatile
---
I completely understand your point but I find it disheartening that the devs discriminate against a group of their players simply because they’ve spent more time playing the game no matter how small a percent of the community they make up. I’d say 10k+ is less than 1% of the community but they’re also the most invested and committed to the game in most cases and should be shown respect every few updates
---
Don't completely agree with autoaim. Maybe instead of dmg reduction, reduce it over a distance. Like Leon's attacks. This way, autoaiming at face to face will be justified. Plus, El Primos auto aim 99.9% of their shots.
---
Let the bet begin then.
---
Maybe a star power for poco that makes his ult deal damage (slightly less to his regular attack), so he can play like an anti bush character
---
I had to listen to Gene a bunch of times before doing that panel XD
---
It does?
---
1) They listen to the community quite a bit, a lot more than other devs. You have to realize reddit is less then a hundredths if brawlstars playerbase.
---
2)Sire you can have better matchmaking, but that will just cause more players to complain. Nobody wants ten minute queues.
---
You mean Rosa, right? Right?!
---
I get that, I have Dumpling Darryl and Loaded Rico and they’re great to play as, even after months of having them. But for most players, these are simply cosmetics that won’t keep them satisfied in the long run. Something needs to be added that will be relevant enough for the masses to be entertained for a long time. New modes that are heavily broken upon release, new environments, and new skins don’t do that job
---
*cough cough* Bibi *cough cough*

POCO NUDE LEAKED

Perfection of its greatest!!!! Dis is very epic!!!!! You must have taken a loooong time to make this!!!!

This is so funny 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣Wtf how people think about this?! 😆😆😆
---
The edge of the shots clipped them?
---
Sorry to anyone that got pissed off by this. It was actually my drawing and I did it for fun. It was meant as a joke but it did get a lot of upvotes while I was sleeping. Anyway I'm glad I'm known as 'that kid' because of my shitty joke. If it helps I was told to kill myself a lot😂
---
**T H I C C**
---
Dude. Just because he was very lucky and got Spike, doesnt mean you have to be angry like he cheated on this game to get it. 100-throphie player got Leon? Idc, leave em be.
---
Just accept your fate mortal,
---
Looks good, but poco looks weird without his face paint
---
As a Chicago student I can confirm we are not out yet.
---
Not too sure that is going to happen😂 people hate me as it is.
---
What a pass by that Brock. We need more of this in brawl ball lol

huhu thank you so much :'((( &lt;3

Hahahaha sorry wasn't able to include her xD maybe in other future works? :)

yall are making Brawl Stars like its made by EA. Not all of us pay on games

Yeah and then the dudes who think they are funny saying “dude this belongs in a museum” or “best art I’ve ever seen”

Like ffs
---
you're very kind T - T thank you!

this meme template are not funny

Sheesh, what did you expect, Leon?

thank you! :D

don't worry bud, let me downvote this one for you as well

You beat me to it

This also happened to me but it's only three Energy drinks

don't worry, he wasn't pursuing Tara xD just asking for his fortune to be told hahaha

Yea, i hate this to, but we cant change people "sens of humor", that is not even funny anymore, desperate people for upvotes...
---
Your post has been removed, make sure to use the body of a post to elaborate on the title.
---
Accurate.
---
Why do you have crow down voted
---
So...this is why piper took the kids...
---
I zoomed and saw if it's true upload a short video
---
If you have all the brawlers at 1500-2k trophies, then you are either super lucky or you paid
---
This makes me want to uninstall
---
Yeah
---
Rip spike
---
i dislike teaming but even tho i’m at fairly high trophies with each brawler i don’t encounter teaming so often i’m proud of this community
---
i’m more of the guy who goes around the map and kills people or get them low to be killed by others which is why i get 1-2 kills per match
---
Scrappy Is Scared And Came To Jessie :) He's Crying! 
---
Thanks Btw :)
---
i mean all brawlers at power 4 or more
---
this mans really named a star power one in the chamber.......
---
It’s a subreddit full of children. Not quite sure what you’re expecting.
---
That siege one is pretty good 😂
---
Yes cuz i saw it before
---
What's the use of karma?
---
Yes you can if you have brawlers above 500 lol
---
upvoted
---
This should actually be a deck 👌
---
Jotaro......
---
There could be a scenario that u accidently tap on autoaim when u wanted to aim a shot and have it reduced dmg
---
Lol. Nice.
---
Colt isn’t straight anyway. ❤️
---
Yep... 😑
---
is colt tryna date shelly?
---
Ok! I hope you complete your success
---
I apologize, but I needed to do it
---
1) The extent of the complaining I heard was people just being mad about retropolis. Then again, I’m not that active on the subreddit so I don’t know of the biggest problems you are referring to.
---
2) It’s kind of hard to do that though. “Skill level” is impossible to detect, and most of the matches (in my experience) are fairly close in trophy range except in the high trophy counts. I don’t see what you could do. A team with a 10 trophy advantage isn’t gonna necessarily be better than the other team
---
3)
---
Nice 😍
---
Yeah why?
---
Yeah hthe enemy is so fast with ed
---
Boosting your internet self-esteem
---
Either I save them for next skins or I spend it on offers
---
Original but brawl TV has at least a 100 viewers per match
---
And idon't think they would want to see an entire flood of names popping up
---
I feel like the idea of crow's star power is going over everyone's head. (Mainly because they don't think but thats off topic)
---
That 10% damage reduction changes so many interactions between brawlers its insane. People always complain about crow being super squishy (DESPITE HIS FAST MOVEMENT SPEED AND SMALLEST HIT BOX)  that 10% damage reduction will help him so much.
---
Lool at it this way...when crow poisons a player your teammates basically have a 10% health buff when fighting that brawler and that can change the fight but thats just one person imagine poisoning everyone, you have the movement speed and the hit box to run in and poison people don't be scared its just a jessie.
---
His poison doesn't need to stack because there is no reason for it to stack. If you are right next to someone you will die so its obviously better for you to play at range to poke away at the other team. Plus crow can easily poison 2 people at once with a single attack if you aim your shots instead of autoaiming
---
yes fbi this post right here
---
yes officer this post right here
---
You must already have some legendaries then, right?
---
***MADE WITH MEMATIC***
---
You want to hit me?
---
Then come closer.
---
His face looks weird.
---
Leon's super has been changed so many times now that its coming to the point were its almost balanced but it needs something. My idea is to make it disable when he takes damage and give leon himself a damage buff. He won't be able to sneak to you anymore since when you hit him he won't be invisible (it would increase his skill cap) the damage buff is what he really needs right now because doing 200 poke damage isn't going to do anything
---
I'm talking about how you took those comments seriously when those were meant to be jokes
---
I know ..but wtf is that !
---
I think the date you started playing at is more important. My friend first played brawlstars on release day and then didn't play for a few months. When he checked back he immediately unboxed 2 legendaries.
---
Maybe there are flaws in your art? Why don't you identify them instead of blaming it on others
---
Make Tara's shadow throw cards.
---
I can
---
Bibi's home run about gives her the utility she needs to be good. Without it then she is just a weaker Frank. The damage buff isn't what she needs.
---
Instead of being brain dead and just remove the home run ability why not just be normal and buff it by reducing the knock back range. Thats just my idea of a buff but now that i think about it, it would ruin her utility. 
---
Maybe just waste your first attack just before you are able to hit someone so they wouldn't be knocked back. You have a really fast reload so it wouldn't matter.
---
At least they don't upvote their own art XD
---
What is your opinion on early game, 2 man teaming?
---
Brawlers who beat shelly with ease if they’re halfway intelligent: colt, Brock, Nita, Jessie, piper, penny, Rico, crow, spike, Leon, barley, mike, Pam, bo, Carl, Gene, Tara.
---
That’s 17 by my count. 
---
Brawlers shelly should wreck with ease if they’re halfway intelligent: Frank, bull, primo, Rosa, Darryl.
---
Push/too early to tell: shelly, bibi.
---
Shelly isn’t that good. Her super makes her. And her super is only really powerful up close. Be smart. Keep your distance. Not that hard.
---
Mortis: Combo. After 3 dashes in a row increase his movement and reload speed by 15% for 3 seconds.
---
Зачем?
---
are you aware of the offers you’ll get from the shop? I’m sure they’ll be in sale.
---
Что тут блять русского???

I have saw a guy with every brawler except Bo at 2.5k before...

Unless its a mortis without a top hat.

Piper or any other Brawlers who don't have skins, they first need to get remodel then skins.

Where tf is there TNT in training cave

The problem with having updates to the game is that they take time to put them in the game. It's not as easy as pressing a few buttons to instantly fix the problems. They also need to prioritize stuff to get early on in the game so those players stick around, then they would add in endgame content. They also have frequent updates where they can't have anything incredibly major done to the game. If people want that then they have to be willing to wait a long fricking time for it to arrive and as you said, their Dev team is small so it'll take longer.

No one gives a fuck about your drawing. People constantly posts drawings so it's so over saturated to the point where it's annoying. And it's not even worth complaining about, you're drawing is also so simple. The humourous post proves this exact point against you. Its mocking people like you seeking upvotes for a lackluster drawing not worthy of tons of attention.

Mr Teamer, please stop making false excuses to explain the fact that you are teaming. You're a teamer and that's it. 
---
What's wrong with it? So, for you, 2 people teaming against a player who played good enough to get 10+ cubes while the 2 others were just killing honest people by managing to 2v1 them is... fair? Is it a joke or something like that?
---
#Frankbob Squarehead
---
is it?
---
Are you sure this is the sub you wanted to post to?
---
I have some ideas for all Bralwers so uh yeah  
---
Shelly: Fury: Increases damage dealth by 5% for each bullet of her Super that hits an enemy. Lasts 5 seconds!
---
Nita: Bearserk: Hitting enemies with her main attack causes them to take 75% extra damage from the Bear for the next 3 seconds
---
Colt: Headshot: Hitting all bullets on an enemy Brawler with a burst instantly reloads one ammo
---
Bull: Dozin': Bull can use his Shotgun while using Bulldozer
---
Jessie: Shocking!: for each bounce on an enemy, her Thunder Balls deals 10% more damage
---
Brock: Groovin: Hitting at least 3 different Brawlers with his Super increases his movespeed by 100 for 4 seconds
---
Dynamike: Dynamic Dash: Hitting enemies with both Dynamite Sticks increases his movespeed by 50 for 2 seconds
---
Bo: Lionheart: when health is below 50%, increases speed by 50.
---
Barley: Another round?: defeating enemy Brawlers instantly reloads one ammo.
---
El Primo: Extreme Vigilance: when both allies are dead, decreases damage he takes and Super generation enemies get by 50%
---
Poco: Songs of love and peace: Hitting enemies with his Super decreases their damage by 45% for 2 seconds
---
Rosa: Wither: hitting at least 6 punches on an enemy Brawler slows them for 2 seconds
---
Darryl: Runover: hitting enemies with Darryls Super stuns them for 2 seconds
---
Penny: Golden Gaffe: Her main attack spreads into multiple pieces of gold even when she doesn't hit an enemy, but reduces damage of the gold by 50%
---
Rico: Thick Plating: Increases his health from 3360 -&gt; 3920
---
Carl: Whirlwind: Passing by allies while super is active increases their movement speed by 50 for 2 seconds.
---
Piper: Lady's Favor: hitting enemies close up reduces their damage by 30% for 1 second
---

Bat Manners: Hitting multiple enemy Brawlers with her Home Run Swing stuns them for 1 second

Tara: Tararize: Enemies who get pulled by her Super deal 20% less damage for 4 seconds

I thought it was funny because I hadn't been on the subreddit in ages. It was unknown to me that this was an unoriginal and repetitive problem.It was just a parody on someone who drew great art and asked for lots of likes. Anyway a lot of people found it unfunny so I'm not doing that again. BTW no down votes from me my dude, I am aware of my transgression and will give you and UPVOTE for your valid opinion.
---
Yes probably there isn’t much info on him tho so there’s a chance he isn’t but I think he is for sure
---
I do, yep

Content in my profile is much better)

Nice to know the other person's perspective.

So basically you want me to color and finish it off...cuz if you want me to, I will

This is gonna be a huge buff to mortis

Со фразы "сделана как шутка" я капец как проорал. Блэтовцы начали уже под каждым первым видео писать свои даунские комментарии типа "это видео пренадлежит блэтам" и вставляют свою гребаную картошку фри. Я сам был блэтовцем, но понял какой это долбаебизм, и убрал ее нахрен.

Just pick a thrower yourself, if someone uses the tactic you just bomb em, and you will have the advantage of having the space to doge, while they are all traped, or use Rico, same reason

Just upgraded a brawler.
---
I’ll give you some feedback: its peccing beautiful
---
Why does Jessie look ugly? 😱😭
---
You draw incredibly well. Your drawing on the right almost looks too realistic.

Very angry birds epic

It would be only logical, at least as a way of repaying all the trophies lost

Have much fear, teamer is here

“Random winners” but then Gegikor gets them. X Doubt
---
FFFFFFF
---
Um, I'm just saying, it could be better. It looks like you just threw random stuff in the map. There's no synchronization in it. I wasn't being rude. You are the one being rude, just saying
---
Don’t want to pick a thrower cuz only my Colt isn’t at 550 yet, and I played with randoms. The point is, I don’t speak only for me, I speak for everybody who play on this map, doesn’t matter the level or the comp, the only fact that this strategy works again means that something must be done on this map.
---
Firstly, you don’t get coins from gamemodes, you get tokens. And the reason why tokens and trophies are doubled is because it takes double the time. Rather than thinking of it as a 3v3 gamemode times 2, you should think of it as the rewards of two consecutive 3v3 games. If you play gemgrab twice when it comes out you’ll only get 1 star token. Same applies to siege. If you play siege, you get 1 token
---
Yeaaah, of course... 😏
---
Dude, you're better than gedi kor

pro tip: dont play crow as if you had 4k health and a shotgun
---
Ye
---
Eh?

Nope at the bottom.

Hold up, is that a cigarette or a lollipop?

I try to do dis but dobt work

You deserve it bud :)

It makes too much sense for SC to do something logical.

Yes

That is just so stupid.... 13.4 and 5.5 what the actual _fk_

Dont worry, we all know who the true star player was

Hello...
---
what did he say bruh
---
That's not the point..
---
dude, calm the fuck down. before there were no replays, now there's that. In the future they'll expand, just be fucking patient. If they could, they would have done it already, they didn't just decide they didn't want low trophy people not to have it.
---
There's dozens of us!
---
You got down votes for being British lol
---
This is a good idea but this would give me anxiety

Please make love to Kairos and have a child with him to bless the world.
---
No... He disconnected in the middle of the match... That is why he gained no trophies
---
They should rework Piper's super. I feel like it's pretty boring right now.
---
*_AND THEY ALL HAVE RANK 3 MAXED OUT LEGENDARIES_*
---
But the event isn’t there for twice as long
---
It is very interesting, i couldnt even think about it. Great idea.
---
The special offer is a thing for everyone. The daily offers are individual. There's nothing wrong with it so no need to be fixed. If it was a double offer for something you like would you be mad?

Why do they let 5 year old kids play their game anyway? Oh yes cause it's actually most of the playerbase.
---
BONK

Casual flex on that 600 crow, lol I see you
---
Cha cha cha chip and dale
---
On brawl stars anniversary, I think something like 15th of june
---
This low on trophies you can't really complain. You lose only 2 trophies for regular 3v3s. You'll win more right away and compensate, don't worry about it
---
I know there are 2. You don't need to point out the obvious. And seriously, why are you still trying to make a point? What the hell are you getting from this? We know your right. So just stop. Fucking hell.
---
First of all, you are the one that needs to calm down.
---
Second of all they already have the option to replay, do why not just make it free for all like all the other games.
---
Oh fungus you may be right
---
Would be good for sneaking, good idea
---
This is beautifully well done!
---
Don't you mean equalizer?
---
Because it’s satire and it mocks the people who spam average art on this subreddit and expect to make it to the front page
---
What have you brought upon this land
---
"I made a short parody..."
---
When you see that little eye pop up indicating that someone is spectating the game, does it mean that they're spectating you specifically?  Or are they just a general spectator?  I am not sure how the system works and was always curious about it.
---
My map for very easy
---
Ok now that is just amazing, one question tho, HOW?!
---
This deserves more upvotes, it's amazing! :0
---
He obviously plays a lot of solo showdown and finishes top 5. Gains trophies. Doesn’t win.
---
Thanks! Well, just editing one file, idk if I can talk here. Watch my other map if you like this one.
---
But, how can there be 2 bot 2's. This is beyond science
---
Removed - Your post is too short, please expand on your title.
---
It’s one of my absolute favorites because any brawler is meta. Wanna bush camp with shelly or bull? Cool. Wanna have plenty of wide open space for brock or piper to shoot? We got you. Love it.
---
no
---
How did u make your map playable in friendly battle?
---
And this map is very great, good job
---
Looks awesome!
---
But these kind of satire posts are karma farming an low effort?
---
I’m not sure. A friend told me.
---
Crow is a character that shines when it comes to zoning opponents, applying pressure, and making it easier for your team to heal up before pushing forward on enemies who cannot defend themselves due to poison.  He is good at checking grassy areas for flanking brawlers and allows visibility in the grass to these enemies.  His super should be utilized defensively to bait enemies close then move away and continue applying pressure from a safe range(offensively if opponent is super low and isolated). He dominates a 1v1 when his super is full and can utilize multiple play styles depending on the game mode.  His strategy for effectiveness does require a more passive playstyle but his ability to enhance a variety of team comps allow for more versatility and replay value compared to other brawlers with a very mechanic playstyle.  I think he is a great underrated character that is probably disliked due to his low hp and need to dodge effectively.  My only thing I’d like to see buffed would be like what people on this thread suggested and speed up the time in which he can get his super to give him more survivability due to his low health pool.
---
Maybe but in high rank I only play duo and I want to up my leon but it’s not that easy with this kind of Map
---
10100 no legendary

Sandwich!!!

Thank you! As I said in another comment, just by editing a file. I can tell you in pm, here is not allowed

Hmmm...
---
I am Heavy weaponguide
---
Yes pls 🥺
---
Actually no
---
The dinamite takes so much time to explode
---
Is iT just me or dus the attak sound like yeet sory for bad inglich
---
The idea is you can get same rewards from siege as winning 2 games of gem grab. If you got 2 star tokens from siege, you wouldn’t be able to get that from 2 games of gem grab. This would only work if there were two star tokens per event and winning siege would give both star tokens at once
---
Exactly and teammates spend ages deciding what brawler to use and then last min change decision so yea just play with randoms to save time.
---
Rosa is balanced now
---
Wait that's illegal
---
Ugh. Duos have the stalest meta in the game imo. Pipers and genes everywhere. Throw in a dash of Leon and crow. You got yourself a duo.

Sorry, that was on accident.

Leon too
---
Idk I just know he used to triple jump in GG coral to win 100%-100% games at the last second, probably hasn’t done anything else doe bcuz he hasn’t got training cave
---
The day he was released this was the map we could play
---
Hey can you make Leon next?
---
Epic drawings
---
What. What do you mean? This isnt a repost, and if it is, show me the post
---
and please dont put that here
---
leon is too much OVER POWER
---
I’m not the one that made the joke
---
It's fine, I gave them both an upvote
---
nope. robots can't reproduce k

Lol k

The last word out of your sorry mouth will be Sir, and it will be loud!

That’s what you get for playing fidget spinner

Thanks!

Reported. Can’t be linking NSFW content for a game that kids play too, man. Especially when some of the characters are canonically underage...
---
I was thinking about doing Leon next so I’ll probably do it
---
Yup. And now we’re getting road rage Carl while it’s in rotation too.
---
you bet!👍

YOU MAKE ME POCO LOCO

Spike has never been so delicious 😋

makes me lose trophies (just got -50 today but got that sweet star token) and brawl ball is actually fun without much more risk
---
Yea, I just like making maps and then posting them on here
---
YESSS
---
With that logic we should get two for the big games
---
Same! I haven't had any great ideas in a while though.
---
pike
---
Now instead of 100 trophies for a star token, it’s 200
---
It's not default.
---
Some people... Celebrate that weird festival in mainland China where humans eat dogs ...
---
 But not us
---
I usually just make it up as I go
---
Whatever it takes
---
You can get Piper in brawl ball though
---
*"GEOLOGY ROCKS"*
---
It’s translates to “your gems are gone lol”
---
Huh. I should try that
---
They are both good
---
Good job man it looks really nice.
---
How good do you think my map was?
