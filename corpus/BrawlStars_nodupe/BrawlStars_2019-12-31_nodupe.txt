Colt (Carl‚Äôs friend): Are you sure about that?

Correct, and if you get got by crows extra toxic star power you get blue down arrows, very similar to the downvote icon

The better question is where do the bad randoms come from? Instagram memes?

(Please tell me if I'm making myself clear with this joke)
---
I‚Äôve only done colt Shelly and poco but I‚Äôll keep making more.
---
I actually kinda like it , this map is challenging and I won 2 games with no power cubes xD . ( I beat an El primo with 5 power cubes and I was playing as Nita . )   
---
It's not a bad map tho :v . ( I am a tryhard too ) .
---
Oh.
---
I feel the pain.
---
there is pink piper and piper calavera
---
Actually using dynajump is funny
---
True
---
Wow, Capture the Flag in 5v5 mode would be really sick!
---
I sent the friend request
---
It fuckin ruined snake praire
---
Sure, you never really play with people you add after a couple of good games. What i did was join a local club and make connections. Ofcourse if you‚Äôre bad at the game, that won‚Äôt help you. Supercell has given us enough options to not play with randoms, it‚Äôs your choice to do so.

What can I say except delete this

Yeah I know right!

Because even his cart is bored of his talking .....
---
15200 and no legendary
---
Currently there are none
---
Bruh why did people down vote there is something called sarcasm
---
Probably because the new one is too shiny. The old one was clean.
---
SMOKEYYYYYY !
---
That‚Äôs because that Shelly was back stabbing your team
---
Grooky and bibi could go well
---
This is a lot better ! you got my vote dude .
---
Stfu you toxic jerk
---
Just saying it to be cool :&lt;.

but enemy team steal a gift, then they stay in their base so your team has no chances to steal their gift, then you lose

This aged pretty well.

coming in january
---
Especially when they are about to make the second goal .. so ... why do that?  what's the point?  to look like a "good player"?  Anyway, this is so stupid :/
---
r/Darrylmains likes this

Medicine commercials listing the side effects:
---
But I have mortis
---
That's not OG.
---
Oh nvm
---
r/brokethechain
---
mortis can be used on bb if you can play him. kairos's statistics are ruined by noob mortises that try to trickshot and cant dribble. he can cover ground, you just need one good teammate and he can speed away into the goal.
---
ambush piper is a great (idk what brawler type this would be). she can kill enemies from afar on certain maps like backyard bowl and pinball dreams, creating an opportunity for a goal. her super can wallbreak.
---
I'm like.. "come on, just score"
---
 I even understand some that stand in front, it's just for the game time to go rolling but spinning is meaningless and rude
---
Why? Lol
---
It was the same way in life leach and I kinda love it
---
Beat meat to it

It didn‚Äôt have boxes in that mode either, all the cubes came from people

---
Before global, so just over a year
---
And patience
---
Thx for loving my video uwu. But you don't have to pay money to support me, that's my motto
---
not really considering people spend hundreds of dollars on gems per year
---
I've see this before
---
After doing the math, at this rate, it's around 1 dollar for 200 star point! , who would psy for that 10k star points skin?
---
1 year ago,I was just like her
---
When did you finish?
---
2700 star point is one bull skin, or a push toward a 10k star point skin üåü
---
Supercell:no buff
---
If you have been playing for 2 years at ‚Äúleats‚Äù then you should have enough trophies to get all the trophy road brawlers. There is no way you have been consistently playing for 2 years and only have those brawlers.
---
Kinda makes sense though
---
i believe you, it makes sense for the coins at least
---
I wish they buff mortis then nerf his star power it will be more fair and fun!
---
After doing the math, 1 dollar for 200 star points, so who would pay for that 10k star point skin?
---
I love vids like this
---
What?
---
you get at least 600 damage(or whatever damage a card deals), while with leon you only get 150(or something like that) for each blade, and you dont always get every blade to hit
---
This happens way too much for me
---
Bruh it‚Äôs supposed to not help the new player
---
I don't think there will be another old skin, specially for Mortis; I mean, we already have the top hat Mortis.
---
Same problem here, would supercell like that?
---
Any brawler can teamwipe
---
iirc the reason why this showdown map doesnt have any boxes is because the map creator (Ash Youtube) intended to submit it as a lonestar map which dont have powercube boxes. however, supercell decide to add it as a graveyard shift map and now its a showdown map.
---
Actually a Goblin Rush game mode might be kind of cool
---
Hmm.. Yes i agree
---
Because in FPS games you don‚Äôt get unlimited grenades?
---
I honestly don't know where to begin on how wrong/stupid this comment is

I'm 10 but I'm at 14k with no legendary

Ricochet is the best geometry it should be taught in all classes

Heck no. Games faster than this happen all the time
---
Chell and turret wow!! Awesome idea... and.. what about GlaDoS??:))
---
What the fuck are you on about? They are t changing the game in anyway they‚Äôre just changing the perspective
---
I get that‚Äôs going to be challenging for you to understand though. One quick look at your profile shows your stupid, transphobic and racist lol.
---
Aww man... but what‚Äôs the current record tho?
---
:(
---
1410 power points
---
*oh wow, i like this artist, i'mma look at his/her profile right now..*

If you look at this picture upside-down and cober her teeth wit your thumb you see another face :D

Hay Day and Boom Beach are still alive, they just don‚Äôt have as big of an audience as Brawl Stars

Someone edit Peter Griffin's face to this

Idk, there's people in this sub that are toxic. And it would be kinda cool for Crow to get a different voice

I think I heard a Youtuber (forgot who, maybe Cory or Kairos) that they might keep Present Plunder if enough people play the game mode. But at the same time, if one game mode is getting played less (Brawl Ball) since Present Plunder‚Äôs release, they might not keep it
---
I didn't he just doesn't mind me messing with his paws
---
He said he played on his sister's 1K account, used shelly and went to explore other parts of the map because he thinks his teammates weren't good
---
Nope all of them. I read through them again to confirm it

Yeah but I think it's 60 instead 90 % . And that's what we called spam *exit* button üòÇ

She has to hit a shot before she gets her super, so just don‚Äôt allow that to happen. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I torch all Beas with Piper, so I guess that‚Äôs the weakes 1k in brawl stars history if you can‚Äôt do the same. pipers shots move faster and they kill Bea in 2 shots, same as Beas kills Piper in 2 shots. And sure the charged shot might do as much damage as pre nerf ambush, but she doesn‚Äôt have it every shot and her shots are not as fast as Piper, so a lot easier to dodge.

I think it's great but we why does nobody else love the El primo max icon? That's bullcrap

It would be interesting to play this.

It is actually easy to win by camping in bushes and you can actually team. I don‚Äôt do these and it pisses me off that there are many people doing that, but 5 and 6 are actually true

Honestly it‚Äôll be so fun but so difficult. Either way I‚Äôll love it tbh
---
Unpopular Opinion: Rosa takes no skill to play
---
I do like capture the crown as a name :)
---
I'd make it 5v5 so it's unique from brawl ball, and I'd make the flag slow the carrier so the enemies have a chance to stop them.

I hate when moves have clickbait like that.

Stop

Thanks OP now I‚Äôm gonna remember this every single time I use Rosa.

Yes I was fighting another tick at the beginning of a match and the meteors kept targeting us both

Why

It‚Äôs funny to watch someone use dynajump but they forgot they were using it

how many trophies do you want to show to r/brawlstars?

It would be in third person.

no bad.

And don't be afraid to make some more changes. With these prominent colors all around it comes out really boring. Bring some other shades of colours into it

I am not showing hate or anything whatsoever,  more concern,  you know how people are nowadays always trying to blame the gamers and the games, I want to prevent that
---
Make it a PC game
---
Or just play long range brawlers, in this gamemode they like princess in cr
---
Rosa is my n...... CARL IS MY GAME
---
Supposed to look cool, also to tell u your team
---
This map was out during brawloween and nobody ‚Äúnoticed‚Äù.  Because there‚Äôs nothing there you mouth breather
---
Oh god oh fuck
---
Oh ok
---
Ok, let me try... If you doesn't kill literally anyone and get a 4-1 place you will get 3-4 less trophies (first plase = 7 -6 trophies, even lower than 2 place). 1-2 kills = normal. 3-5 kills +2 trophy (place doesn't matter). 5-7 kills +5, 8 kills +8, 9 kills +10. But there is a problem... Everyone will try to gang a low HP person that already trying to escape from 5 other guys. It should be like... um... If you kill a person with lower than 40% HP - you get half of a normal kill (if you get only half kill, you will get -1 trophy, if you get 2.5, 7,5, 8.5 kills you will get the same amount of trophies that I already said and 1 bonus trophy). This was hard... I think nobody will even undestand me, because I'm bad at English, but anyway...
---
I wouldn‚Äôt get rid of lone star and takedown, maybe just add them onto a rotation of 3 with bounty. Heist, siege, and present plunder would fit and have life leach as a weekend thing (not included in the rotation of boss fight, by itself separated from showdown, not a modifier)
---
Good one
---
Well he technically lost time
---
It is don't mess with my crew.
---
This is amazing
---
I fail to see the problem, she is supposed to be good at close range also she is literally the best in present plunder and one of the best in brawl ball when you get shelly over 750 trophies those are literally her only good gamemodes
---
There is no need to be rude to me sir I have been very polite with you, if you insist I will be taking this threat down if it bothers you this much
---
Good drawing!
---
If you didn't noticed: Pretty much brawler have Red color on them. Hats, boots ot somethin'. For example: Dynamike. He have a red hat in lobby but blue in game. It's Just to know which team is yours.
---
Wtf are you talking about? Seriously. Take a deep breath and stfu. There‚Äôs no god damn swastika except the giant red one you drew.
---
Who is dragon?

I thought was type of gazelle or antelope.

Yeah I did

How much time did you spend on it? It's awesome, good job!

Wants to kill (you), period goes next to the you and turns into a comma and remove the (:) and add a period

Same with Piper at close range

It looks like a plus

2020 is the new decade

That fricking description actually describes me wtf

Really weird..

Well I‚Äôm unlucky and it is already 2020 at my time

It was released as graveyard shift, yes, but it wasn‚Äôt made as a showdown map.

You know Max is a girl right?

The collector support andai. missing s in support to make sentences right soo supports!

In Colt style. I like  it

Nowhere but that‚Äôs the point, your save was cool for sure, but unnecessary
---
It's impossible to get the "star player" badge for a player in "losing" team. Except if the 3v3 competition ends with the "draw" condition, the "star player" badge will give to the player who performs very good.
---
What do you mean? It sounds alright to me buckaroo! ¬†( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)

Dude you‚Äôre a legend. Hope you have a nice year too. Don‚Äôt worry about bad English, it‚Äôs incredible you can speak it that well. I can‚Äôt speak Spanish/Italian (which I‚Äôm learning) nearly as well.
---
ARE YOU KIDDING ME? I GOT MY FIRST AT 11000!

Imo crow is only better than leon. spike and sandy are better. leon needs buffs

Right iron needs a buff

It's ironic that you can get spotted on bushes but can hide behind walls.

seems like heist but with extra steps.

They're holding-hands, and I have no words.

I‚Äôve never seen an emz do that
---
Thank you very much!  You too
---
i Got 700

This looks great but it wouldn't work. That tower dps is too high. In CR it's ok bcs you sacrifice weaker troops in order to stronger troops hit. But here you would hit like 2 hits and you're dead. That would be impossible. It would fix it if you make it spawn a bots that will go and attack so you can hide behind him like in CR or LoL. Otherwise it's wrong.
---
I'm with you, bro. F2P solidarity.

Not really

r/shittybrawlstars

Yes I would love a new skin for Tara , but .. not with gems , with star points .
---
at least you not complaining about leon nerf
---
Holy sh!t
---
Well then use the right team comp, I had a group of friends where I used sandy, my friend used tick, and another used Pam. We probably won 20 games on that map alone, so you know idk what you‚Äôre doing.

Noice check out my posts too if u want

Thank you, Starry-Nightz, for voting on RepostSleuthBot.

Tara is combined with a monster tho .. she's creepy :/ .
---
I saw another one i guess they reposted damn i hate reposters
---
I would agree too if brawl ball wasnt so extremely poppular. Graph of all the modes with thier play rate brawl ball makes up 35% of all plays
---
The game modifiers has aleardy done
---
Chill he‚Äôs new
---
Wheres mortis?
---
If you manage to hit all daggers and 9 brawlers that‚Äôs more damage indeed
---
His face need to be in a horror game..... But its very good
---
Dude its awesome just make borders of hands little bit dark
---
Edited or not?
---
U primu
---
Wtf only 10 to upgrade!! I have 22 to upgrade in which emz,tick,bea is at level 1 and many other need double upgrades!!

You have problems, please stop telling people to die.
---
\[she stabs with umbrella\]
---
Well, that makes sense. Bea isn't supposed to revive with that particular star power, so I think the game considered that Bea was already eliminated and therefore giving that team the win.
---
Purposes? lol

Brawl Stars hates bEA or you have 4 legendaries at 1k
---
Dutch people are the best
---
You can tell if people are lagging in the replays if they walk or attack funny. The same applies during the match if you don't lag yourself.
---
Me too
---
This went from talking about a wall to this.
---
Faster than light
---
Everyone knows this
---
That‚Äôs literally what eye of the storm is except everyone on the subreddit seems to hate it... it‚Äôs simple enough, if you‚Äôre a close ranged brawler play on the bushes at the edge and if you‚Äôre long ranged go to the middle
---
Huh, all I see is garbage
---
Wooooooo!!üò† You have ONLY 2000 TROPHIESüò° some people got a legendary ONLY at 13000 TROPHIESüò°üò†üò°üò°üò°
---
Boxes are the whole point of Showdown, though. It's what makes it unique.
---
Damn she needs to get nerfed but I hope she doesn't bc on my mini i just started i am only using one brawler and since she's the starting i decided her. i could've used rico bc he was free (i made the acct on christmas but i'm very good so i decided against it.
---
He‚Äôs german lol
---
They don't have to love each other, it's just a concept, why do people perceive everything so acutely?
---
Great!
---
You only have 2.6k and u have spike üòí
---
/r/IncreasinglyVerbose
---
btw she's a girl
---
Spike is the best legendary, him or Sandy. He can be played in every game mode.
---
Why do you think I said her???
---
Plz share this post and check out my rare and trophy road brawler ones!

---
I had the same problem. It was the only way that worked for me. Sorry.
---
Well it might be, considering his poison he might be able to deal the 9k damage if he hit multiple targets because of the extra poison damage.
---
I hope so! üôÉ
---
1k and I got crow this morning. My mates at apparently ‚Äò20k trophies‚Äô took an L with no legendaries.
---
#This triggers my OCD
---
Whats rong
---
I wasn't the best spammer back in the day lol
---
Throwers would be super strong if there's only 2 bridges to cross and there's cover nearby. Especially barley, as he leaves a pool of liquid behind that deals damage after he attacks so he can pretty much lock down a bridge forever, and rotate over if needed.
---
Try cross hatching. Looks great tho!
---
I'm a kid and I'm from Latvia))) Have a happy new year! Your english isn't that bad. I can understand perfectly without any problems! )
---
But the star power works for most(I didn‚Äôt try all of them) of the brawlers. It doesn‚Äôt consider they are dead though.
---
When I first illuminated, I was rank 3 instead of two...
---
God these are so shit
---
That's a good one
---
Imagine needing to collect power cubes to win a showdown game! -This comment was made by Shelly gang
---
What a nice Mortis, he saw your fantastic play and decided that you deserved to score. 
---
ü§£
---
I did cry-- but out of laughter! I just paid your profile a visit, just to find out that you had an absolutely maxed account with every brawler unlocked, sitting only at 21k trophies LMAO
---
I'm missing two brawlers myself and I already have 20,5k, plus most of my brawlers aren't maxed either. You're just sitting there, acting like an absolute "brawl-genius" with brawlers at only ~600 trophies. How pathetic can you be? Seriously, this is ridiculously hilarious and I'm glad that my theory about you being a literal hypocrite has just been confirmed. 
---
Also, can you please stop using emojis? Especially the laughing ones. They're the cringiest. :)
---
I think it would be great if you could make your own keybinds
---
This map looks very good!

---
Tick isnt good hes just annoying
---
Thx man
---
I have seen many videos, and they all involve Tick. Tick is a brawler that just cannot win trophies in solo showdown without spinning with the whole lobby. Supercell is just preventing that in advance.
---
Good but maybe replace the metal boxes with water or something supercell don‚Äôt use metal boxes in maps.
---
actually even more
---
Well if you bum rush (which is most likely what they are doing) then you are a noob. The way i found to counter crow is to stay away from open areas and make it to where if the crow wants to fight the crow will have to get real close which is crows weakness because of his low health
---
Ummmm, what?
---
Yeh, the meteorites are kinda gay right now.
---
No I didn‚Äôt
---
Momy I think it's mommy
---
Skip to 0:16 Forgot to mention that

xD

I‚Äôm guessing Darryl miss placed his shotguns cause Tara would have made a mistake
---
Forgive me senpai

Yes you did, because i know you can't draw like that
---
Define salty
---

---
What is that sub
---
BREATH IS A JOJO REFERENCE!!!!
---
Bro, when your team has no destructive abilities other than Tara's super, you are kinda forced to use it against walls for some maps
---
I freaking love this map! I pushed my first brawler(Daryl) to 500.
---
_Our_ skin concept
---
Ah yes a very competitive game indeed
---
man, people who say shelly needs a nerf are only low trophies players or just teamers (beacuse both have the same amount of skill lol)
---
Could you try again please? I still didn't receive the 'friend' request.
---
Oh I can't wait to watch someone as sensitive as you cry because he thought he was better than anyone else. Being ignorant is way better than being a hypocrite imo so eh
---
Everything is cool until Tara starts to talk
---
some clutch moments! 
---
gg mate!
---
It does now but I‚Äôm talking about before a few recent updates
---
Definitely my favorite showdown map
---
Kill em

But we still classify it as that to make it easier

Thank you! Yeah some clutch moments like 26 hp when robot 0,00001 mm from me lel
---
people who played in beta were able to get the trophy road brawlers in boxes
---
they did this to stop low effort replays to be shared

Ok, nice. Hope you have as much luck in the future as well.

I have 27 brawlers soooo thanks you too ü§ó

But, you have 3 legendaries.

Hey he at least gave effort maybe hes a young kid and I think its a really good concept

I, as an Enderman, (and long-time minecrafter) can confirm this is very good stuff.

I see it in Battle log

Yep
---
i agree
---
But what about 400+ trophies replays that are low effort?
---
For a maxed account for over a year?
---
Great post
---
Its not that youre forced to go close to her, its that she can infinitely stun and chain her ult with no actual way to get out of it.

The weird thing is that 4 people liked the comment
---
Bout 4 minutes. Why?
---
I actually said that when I got Leon and I‚Äôm a f2p. But is because i really don‚Äôt like Leon and I love crow. But I recently got crow too and it‚Äôs my third legendary.
---
I was joking because there is no actual image
---
How is that going to help them kill the big brawler
---
WHAT?!, WHY SUPERCELL DOESN'T EVEN GIVE ME LEGENDARY WHEN GIVING A FU\*\*ING SPIKE T OA 2620 TROPHIES GUY
---
nice
---
Is spike, even though i wanted crow, but I‚Äôm still grateful.
---
Good map, keep making them, just try not to have water in brawl ball or 1 tile gaps
---
No, but I got leon and bea

Wow, you're really not a flexible thinker huh

All the hate comments but you're obviously new, I was kinda fascinated by this too when I first started playing.

I made a idea about that ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)

I'm glad they were gone. Gave me and my partner a chance to show how freaking sick we are
---
Im brazilian haha
---
No, maybe make it so that its total trophy count
---
Nice map honestly, although there are some 1-tile gaps. But that doesn‚Äôt have to be a problem, it might as well be a feature. It could make it so tanks are a worse alternative and would change up the Brawl-ball-meta a bit. Nice idea overall.

Well yes, but I‚Äôm not asking for him to be OP, I just want him to not be as bad as he is right now, I want his time back, but not his damage, since that really was OP.

My suggestion is to increase the length of the seasons. Maybe to four or even six weeks. This would also separate the more skillful players with the others.
