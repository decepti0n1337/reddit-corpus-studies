The difference in how much I play when BB is available compared to when it is not is massive. I wish we could see more stats for each game mode because I have 4,000 3v3 wins and I can assure you at least 3,000 alone are from BB. I want to know the exact amount though.

---
That is pretty balanced matchmaking tbh
---
Did anyone else find that hilarious? Sure it must have been annoying for the teammates but as a viewer that was hilarious.
---
I‚Äôm not saying whether or not he‚Äôs a good youtuber, I‚Äôm just saying that he‚Äôs respected and has a large fan base making him a big youtuber, though not the biggest.
---
they are both fun to use
---
Bull 1 second later: well well well what do we have here?
---
Honestly does it really bother you that much?
---
Agree.
---
Santa (the red one) has infinite lives and each of the rebelling eves (the blue ones) only have one life. He must defeat them all before they destroy his presents.
---
1-My and .. looks like you have not seen .. from an overwhelming majority of players, so much so that they have created an application to find teams
---
 2-yes, however alternating between and also playing from time to time with someone 
---
3-here, not that I'm interested in looking at profiles:v

honestly randoms throw the game way too much
---
How did you get that skin?
---
I forget where, but i saw a person who exposed him and showed an account on twitter that made it
---
Explosions, explosions, the bo falls down
---
Gene's star power
---
Honestly, this is my first and only SC game that I play...buy I quickly get the impression that the team consists of like 10 guys trying their hardest to manage 3+ major games at once. They genuinely take forever to implement even the most basic changes. Not bashing as I completely get they are not a large company, but that alone is what is slowly pushing me away.
---
I like it!

 2-yes,Solo SD,Randoms and from time to time with some friend

You got all the legendaries shut up
---
No, you may get 78 upvotes

---
Whats the problem with solo sd? I like to rank up wins on there, about to hit 800 even. I see it as skill rather than wins in duo sd or 3v3 which could signify you get carried a lot and cant play on your own..
---
Hello :D

Ahh I already understood it, I did not do the hats because I was able to lole [srry for my bad English, I‚Äôm from Spain]

i dont think its the frank's first game of bb since it was clear that he was throwing the game
---
No just wrong
---
They badn ppl who break supercell ToS
---
Game throwing actually isn't on tjeir ToS so they don't ban 
---
Account phishing, Inappropriate languages, etc will
---
Frank honestly needs a small buff. like perhaps a tiny less hesitation before attacking. he dies way too much for a tank
---
It‚Äôs jokes like these that make me wanna kill my self
---
Brawl ball should 100% be permanent and so should heist fuck bounty and siege
---
Woah there buddy slow down. Piper definitely does not need a buff.
---
poco needs a buff
---
So tencent even bought supercell. Tencent is the real EA who is much more money greedy. At least EA has good games but tencent makes games worse
---
Though I love brawl ball, I still feel like siege is still an important part of brawl stars :)
---
I saw a colt in there as well
---
because you were teaming
---

---
Get leon out of the needs a nerf HE IS A LEGENDARY SO TREAT HIM LIKE ONE
---
Okay sorry about what I said lol, forget about it
---
Mortis is my name Brawl Ball was my game
---
Hate when this happens
---
Yellow acid, whats wrong with that?
---
As a leon main, I can say he does need a nerf, so 9 year olds like you dont spam auto aim and learn how to "git gud"
---
As someone who only plays showdown I understand the pain behind pushing poco ugh
---
What do you suppose? I wouldn‚Äôt mind seeing a little more damage out of him.
---
Shelly?
---
Indeed it was a nightmare
---
Obviously! ¬¨¬¨
---
Tbh when Leon first came out he was annoying to play against but eventually you learn how to counter him without much effort. His shooting pattern really is bad :/
---
Bro I have him at 500 so stfu and I'm at 7.4k so I think I know how to both counter and use him and ALSO btw I'm almost 16
---
FortTesticalls
---
Thanks for using it!
---
In my opinion seige should be permanent it's much more fun
---
Same
---
Why does the bat only have one testical?
---
Yeah

"You made"

It is really great template it has lots of potential appreciated

That's barely barley. Let alone cowboy barley
---
Wow.  You're so stupid.  You STEAL somebody else's CREATIVE TALENT and CLAIM AT as YOUR OWN for INTERNET POINTS?  Good luck getting an actual job some day, you're gonna need it.
---
YOURE the stealer.
---
Thanks man, for using this trash!
---
I am 5300 with 22 brawlers. Got every mythic but no all epicsüòÖüòÜ
---
Maybe they'll release it along with maple barley. And like wizard barley, we can get it for free if we sign up for the id
---
Nice I used to be 4300 with 19 brawlers then got frank before I quit.
---
I just had something like this in my mind, so I drew it. Usually I draw recreations, but this one is original.
---
Was expecting the loud moaning meme.
---
TIH... Beefy Piper with a dick
---
I thought about that too
---
Mortis is definitely really good too. Perfect for the character.
---
Ha ha ha ha ha, sooooooo funnnnyy
---
I still don't have Crow, Spike, Frank and Bibi. But i got Leon and i am waiting for my second starpower so i am not complaining.
---
You should put evidence for mods to give a quicker ban on him instead of his profile picture.
---
He reminds me of Merasmus from TF2, if you know what that is
---
The "Bo effect"
---
I don‚Äôt have crow spike Tara Bibi and gene
---
u welcome fellow morti also keep up
---
I can't fit it all in a screenshot.  They can go to his profile.

---
Great concept
---
I think that we need more brawlers that spawn animals and attack 
---
He spawns in the snak and each bite from the snake cause poison damage of like 90.
---
Main attack can be either just a melee or something with a snake
---
Star power could be something about their bond or speed
---
there are way too many unnecessary bushes and the map feels like a thrower fest
---
I revived this and I hope u like it! Supercell I hope u like my map!
---
Oh the irony.
---
I sure hope there's no meteor modifier. Wouldn't want anything happening to the doges
---
Super cell be like ‚Äò LIfe leech confuse new players ‚Äò . Then how the f they learn how to team why won‚Äôt they confuse when others is spinning . I think supercell is just scared to fix the teaming issue cause they are scared that their beloved showdown players stop playing because of life leech . Bad excuse bad excuse , there‚Äôs no such thing as confuse . You can learn right ? Just like Sansa Stark said ‚Äò I am a slow learner but I do learn‚Äô . F supercell like literally
---
nice map

better than before

Came straight from instagram an was used to double click an image to like itüòÇ

To be honest I never liked life leech. Don‚Äôt hate me for having an opinion

The real question is: what is supercell id 2?

Ok ;-;

Thanks. I used a similar design to the ones that you tubers like kairos got in their vids.

Yeah, why not.

I do
---
It was removed to make space for rico. Now the people who had it just don't have the image. Its rare at
---
I disagree with half of the statements above because Supercell wouldn't do that at all. The ones that I agree are removing seige (or at least rework on it), tara remodel, club battles and buff mortis. Personally to me, I would rather want the old maps back (eg Canvern Churn and Split Second) but only available on Friendly games just like Kaboom Canyon and Crystal Canvern.
---
Or he just had the worlds biiggest account tilt
---
Gene's about to pull 'em over with **„Äå Z a H a n d o „Äç**
---
I'm surprised they even have the resources to create another dev team honestly
---
Life leech will break the game because of crow, pam and barley. NO THANKS!
---
Carl memes. So hot right now
---
He started in March 2019 tho
---
I'm not looking for attention, there's no reason, im simply trying to see who still has the ricochet flair. Why the hell would be looking for attention by asking a question.
---
Tara the neglected one
---
Yes I know, that's why I'm curious to see who still has it :)
---
Half the maps needa be remodeled removed and or put back to their original form
---
Good post; I also feel like many creators miss the point that a good map should cater to all the brawlers, not just a small subset of them.
---
Did he get moved or something or fired
---
can we change the server location?
---
Was 300, then 250, then dropped down to 200. -100 easy math, don't you think?
---
I wasn't in a Team, those all are RANDOMS
---
Thanks!
---
Nah , my sever location changed jz becuz i m in Asian right now but before I was in uk
---
You know, there ARE people who EAT rocks
---
Well if you‚Äôre F2P, you‚Äôre basically leeching off of the devs by not supporting them.
---
Nintendo switch?  I mean I dont mind but who want this?
---
bro he trippin'
---
I don't know
---
Idiot? We have the right to not like this map
---
dude your luck is very bad im at 5.5k and i have everything but the 3 legendaries and im f2p
---
Che la fortuna ti assista!
---
I made it :)
---
I miss ricochet... now he seems like a chubby robot... before he was a FREAKIN‚Äô WAR SAVAGE ROBOT!
---
Can someone explain how it gets rid of teaming It‚Äôs not clear for me

Thanksüòöüòö

Now you won't get anything for 5 months

why do people complain about siege, showdown is much worse.
---
Thanksüíñ
---
Dont buy, you are gonna get garbage
---
It makes me think of [this](https://youtu.be/6_eoPTPN4og)
---
Seriously though he need a small reload speed buff, and maybe a slight damage buff too
---
A bull comes outta nowhere and squishes the piper
---
Doesn't even have pro
---
Downvoted everything lul
---
It's so sad that this is true. I haven't even manage to get bibi or gene üò´
---
Same :(
---
True
---
Nice but what if i cant trade because (s)he is max level? We need to have a little stortte for pp too.

This idea isn't really good for maxed players (like me), I didnt think about that when i made this

omg this is super unlucky, im 6k, never paid the game and i have all characters except leon and mortis...

Pam has a basement full of slaves

same at 4750 trophis still didnt get my second epic ! i only have pam

Exactly

Finally seeing a "thr boys when" meme in r/brawlstars
---
this looks...tough.
---
omg its so detailed
---
i think its sarcasm
---
I thought there was gonna be Zelda comments thank God there's not
---
eeedubzz
---
Ur welcome
---
I'm at 4.3K and have Spike and Leon, in Mythics Gene and Tara but don't have Pam and Frank and Crow
---
The point is brawler drop rate is very low and if you don‚Äôt agree with that it‚Äôs fine.
---
So what? Though it fix teaming and camping, one problem is the game mode is not balanced because most close range and mid range brawlers do not shine very well. Thats why I hate life leech a lot. Btw I'm not a teamer in Solo Showdown.
---
Right now it‚Äôs silly to waste 49 gems when you can wait and spend 29 and get a 1k token doubler when it goes on sale. Good things come to those who wait. I‚Äôll say it again. Mega boxes are the biggest scam in the game.
---
Fucking tilter

I spent my share

While not will

more like another device to bend

Thats not the point lol, you just said to them that a key doubler is more value right now and thats not true lol. Mabey in the future it will be and it is better to save I 100% agree but what you said is wrong.
---
I only accept this kind of teaming
---
Never said right now. You just assumed that.
---
No the question is why didn't you rekt them
---
Basic attack: aim like a throwers but he will dash like mortis (soo some kind of jump attack) idk its maybie stupid after all but original
---
His sack is hangin'
---
LolüòÇ
---
Its really map dependent tho, if Skull Creek or Rockwall Brawl had life leech it would be a different story. And what Medium Range Brawler is bad in Life Leech? Nita definitely isnt, neither is Crow, Shelly, etc. But I agree that something should be changed to tanks, maybe their bleeding effect is slower or they get a faster walk speed only in Life Leech to make them more effective.
---

Its always when your deciding whether it's worth healing the member and once your finished thinking you throw the super and the person's dead.

I'm going to make the bold assumption that it's a mega box.

I don‚Äôt have any of the epics. I only recently unlocked the last super rare. I managed to get a single mythic though, mortis, but he apparently took all my luck

I was good at first but your by :3 threw me off my head: suspicious ü§îü§îü§îü§îü§îü§î
---
2v2 trophies doesnt count , so if youre teammates throw the game it doesnt harm you
---
Make it so that it is the normal mode in high trophy ranks.  Nobody teams in leech
---
I was playing solo and found this guy having power 10 Tara with star power at rank 12. I checked my battle log and found that this guy is either pure p2p or a lucky man. He has 4 maxed brawlers with star powers. I wonder whether he sold his  balls to buy these brawlers.
---
NOBODY SAID SHE NEEDS A NERF PLEASE.
---
No no , I got the gems from a regular Brawl box
---
It will be full of Shelly and bulls
---
Why does this feel slightly nsfw

YES

I Never play siege because -10 is way to scary when playing with randoms

There is a lot of stuff in this post that I don't understand-this is one of them

i hev the better version online plased
---
The big bot‚Äôs hitbox is so big that it‚Äôs radius is bigger than the width of the wall
---
What's wrong with that
---
'Gimme some sugar' make's it even better, it already was an A but that made it an A+
---
At 10K and it is still fun for me. I think they are holding off adding end game content because a majority of players are NOT at the end of trophy road
---
yes, that one side character no one cares about and dies in the first minute or so
---
So amazing
---
Right ? I love killing people with that big robot
---
I just want hot maze to return.

Bring back life leach

It‚Äôs when I felt that instinct and I almost did the same thing that I stop playing this game.

Can I ask why I got downvotes
---
But you won
---
thank you
---
Haha just ignore his argument, thats an even better strategy than teaming
---
Actually the first one does not progress and teamers do
---
oh please, i was there when the map exists and i didn't found any problem, atleast to myself. the map was the most intense map then others imo

peeps who wants this removed doesn't know fun

Bring back ryan on brawl talk

Still terrible matchmaking.

Its so obvious you got that from google. Also go to hell. Stop stealing gedikor skins

Wow this boy have a big dick lol
---
Bots cause I like to win
---
welp, kids these days
---
you should say that yourself to supercell. Yet, they already posted a post in ig about how the gene technique in the map was so exquisite. im pretty sure they wont remove it
---
In total of all matches, 100- throphies. I'm sorry that I can't show more than 2 matches each screenshot. Are you really that dumb?
---
Ok
---
In what world
---
But the tier list is about avoiding -_-
---
Thats from google

LOLOL als ob ech en post vo der gseh xD

I wasn't talking about trade tokens. You get to request cards from your clan every 8 hrs with no token.
---
cheating death i see

The brawl star gods love you

Nice but make the eyes a bit smaller because it's kinda unprpoprtional and not very "brawlified". Other than that, love it

nobody is thinking about the lore a good thing to the game? it would be great to see some theories like the junker family tree stuff get approved by the devs themselves
---
Mortis needs a bugg though ._.
---
You thought -100 trophies
---
Buff Poco
---
Oh i thought you played siege
---
You got aids
---
Si si si
---
Kairos: I see this as an absolute win!

---
Bcs they will be to op ;)
---
Agree with you here, I wish each rank was like a checkpoint that you can't fall below.
---
No because then I broke my phone :)
---
I get so bummed when I fall below the trophy level for my rank :(
---
so do I
---
Umm... not really? Carl, Gene and (maybe) Rosa will be nerfed, and then Mortis will be balanced. Note this: before these new brawlers' domination, *nobody* asked for any Mortis balancing. The meta is broken, he is not.
---
I don‚Äôt see your point. On Snake Prairie i still can be a lot more scared of a bull
---
Lol
---
Rosa is that you?!
---
They're evolving!
---
Gene and Carl are balanced Rosa is weak without her super her super is the only thing keeping her alive in the meta.
---
It‚Äôs what you get for teaming
---
But then matchmaking would take forever.

Nice concept dude

i lost 200 trophies because of it
---
It‚Äôs so glorious...
---
so your El Primo is better...
---
I would like a buff... Maybe faster reload speed to heal and attack
---
but for real hes one of worst brawlers according to the community and I got his Star Power first, same case for Mortis
---
Congratz man you can team and team kill effectively
---
shes the map, im the map, im the map, IM THE MAAAAPPP!

Stop asking for buffs. Buff Brock tho

Another Free Skin like Mortis perhaps?
---
he doesn‚Äôt need a buff, gene needs a nerf
---
It's no where near pay to win. I've been playing for about 5 months. I have all but 3 brawlers unlocked, 2 at lvl 9, and a ton at lvl 8 or lvl 7 that I havent upgraded yet. You all just want instant gratification.
---
What
---
No dont
---
Then why does every pro rank him as one of, if not the worst brawler in the game and thinks he needs a buff?
---
#buffpoco
---
All I hear is mini laddd saying everything in sexy voice and then finally "sbeve"
---
I have to because I'm too unlucky
---
Boom beach= good

First of all, supercell wont see this lol. Second, why would they special coins that you could buy skins with? That would make them lose alot of money ... which makes 0 sense from a business standpoint. If you dont want to spend the money on the skins than don't, but dont be expecting supercell to give them to you for free lmao. Get a clue
---
Not just hotter, he‚Äôs better and stronger and a god
---
what?
---
Dude, bs on the switch would be lit
---
I tilt on brawl so much lmao. It rages the shit out of me but I keep coming back
---
I'm free to play and have Crow.!üòÇüòÇ
---
There's the third on community! Thanks to like this.
---
That my friends is the true definition of robot power
---
I love zhe inglish
---
 he is ok, bibi needs attack speed buff
---
Sorry I don‚Äôt speak El Primo
---
Wtf? Beta started in June 2017. If you started a month ago, the game had been out already for 23 months.
---
That meme was by me!!!

Why u copy
---
I am 14 and this is Geology
---
How about when Mortis hits a target with his dash, he regains half of an ammo bar? This would increase his combat effectiveness, but not make him OP fast.
---
But now you can
---
No one's knows about Boom Beach
---
WHAT ABOUT BOOM BEACH!?
---
Wow, nice drawing you‚Äôve drawn there ;)
---
This game's only been out for 2 years lol. a month ago isn't really early.
---
Hey, at least we don't get the same shitty memes over and over
---
Thankz mi Frend
---
sorry I don‚Äôt speak worse than poco healer
---
No because when you‚Äôre going to hang, the line is going to break

1.You should not play with randoms
---
2.The other team could be premade
---
3.Most people get to 300+ just by bushcamping
---
4.That\`s why i only play showdown(i just think it\`s better even if u don\`t push as fast it is way more fun) my opinion
---
Stop breaking my neck
---
Thanks
---
Am i the only one who were watching Crow?
---
R/whoooosh
---
It said I‚Äôm selling my sons computer because I caught him watching Fortnite porn and I‚Äôm a Christian mother
---
wifi/lagg &gt; randoms &gt; that annoying bot &gt; matchmaking.
---
Probably not even old enough
---
You don't drop in rank, but it still feels like shit
---
Looks great! What do you use to draw
---
r/creepy
---
Hay Day is relaxing
---
Umm... What?
---
Thank you for this extended opinion! Appreciate it!
---
Point being they have different teams for different jobs. You can't just blame Supercell as a whole for one thing if it's only one person making the screw ups. Instead of hating on Supercell, make a discussion about the person making non-applicable changes to the game.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
 As of now both 3D artist and balance teams have 1 person for it as far as I'm aware. So we could definitely have a conversation about why the balances haven't been up to par with the rest of the update.
---
There's gonna be a 6th one sometime in the near future
---
Supercell: "HAH, in your dreams! "
---
Pam: as T H I C C as the map.
---
"...nothing"
---
If you would like to, I dont have a problem...
---
That‚Äôs the point. If you have several brawlers that need upgrading, better to spread the points. It‚Äôs been proven time and time again token doublers are a much better value.
---
By that logic then a white person cosplaying Ash or Misty or any other Pokemon character wouldn't be the real life version of that character.
---
That brawler description went from a 1 to 100 real quick
---
You did it to El Rey Primo too!
---
I have gene but no morthis
---
Then I need some help
---
Or play duos for Robo and be annoyed by meteors
---
Wow, they're both pro players
---
Wdym Misty is obviously a white girl.
---
Looks like SZA
---
Thats just a terrible jessie then.
---
Supercell is mean to us lol
---
Wait a minute...
---
It's THE Donghoon?!
---
From all the art and ideas I have seen here, In my opinion your¬¥s are the best ones
---
No problem bud. I love sharing my knowledge of my favourite game to others!
---
0/10 
---
Not realistic, the cookie wasn't spinning
---
Its not perfect, these posts are annoying. But seeing 2 1k brawlers makes no sense
---
the comment
---
My friend has around that amount of trophies, and just Crow...
---
How old is she?
---
Everyone complaining about siege is a bad player. It‚Äôs really not that bad especially for pushing trophies.
---
But...those shots were all auto aimed
---
6.85k?! Nice. You have good luck unlike me
---
It's balanced
---
Finally someone who understands me
---
Hi
---
Watch Rey's video on YouTube for the best tips and join r/mortisgang.
---
Screw getting a brawler! Ill take 80 gems!!!
---
Usally u should say " thank " . But u aren't sudden to say anything because your awesomness if enough
---
That doesn't mean it isn't clickbait LOL
---
Its bc brawlers like Brock are excited to make skins for in a short amount of time.
---
HOW DARE YOU TEAM IN SCHOOL
---
Thanks againüòÇ
---
thanks againüòÇ
---
I'm starting to see a lotta siege hate posts recently lawl
---
That‚Äôs a sick drawing matey
---
Just nothing to say
---
Where have I seen this before...
---
Art stealer
---
Nice reference xd
---
and my dignity
---
look at power level
---
Poco is decent in Duo Showdown
---
Super:IT'S TIME TO STOP
---
Report it guys don't just comment
---
BOOM BEACH
---
why u do this...
---
Isn‚Äôt he pyro from tf2?
---
How do you even do that? Get a friend and play at the same time?
---
Bruh moment
---
People don‚Äôt like the spawns, and the amount of bush pathing throughout it. Personally I think it‚Äôs fine
---
Why did u get Shelly twice? This is not a In game box
---
yea ranking every brawlers skill level from -10 to 0 carl is a -10 cause every character in this game is brain dead
---
Nah range buff
---
but you‚Äôd need those people to choose you as well
---
Unless you give him the chance
---
I downvoted this because I happen to be F2P AND a beta player. You can test me if you want.
---

---
Love it, imagine the super being a cyclone and Kraken arms flailing out of it.
---
OMG JUST STOP DYING
---
Lol yea but I already have 15k...
---
I swear sometimes I'm doing great and think we're winning, I haven't died, but I look up at the opposing team's score and it's like 20 and I'm like WTF duuuudddesssss who keeps dyyyyinnnggg??
---
Keep
---
That barley
---
**Away from me**
---
Someone probably already saw this
---
*Thiccness is the right answer*
---
Oh yea, that is what I thought.
---
They should make it so that you can arrange it in any way you want right?
---
@gyarafish
---
*cursed x2*
---
Damn, I just commented this, didn't see it had already been done, i added kraken tentacles flailing out the whirlpool though lol
---
**This is pure art**
---
Okay heres the plan:
---
 First you have push the pedal so you go the maximum speed distance. If he catches up, then keep going like that for a few seconds, then brake the pedal to send Carl crashing into your car. Then you open your door and go up to him up close. When he throws his wrench, you immediately catch it (it moves painfully slow) and then pick carl up, and throw him on the ground. Then you beat the police to death with the wrench once they inevitably come, and then run over a couple thousand pedestrians.
---
Since you couldn't make up some stats for them I'll make em for you free of charge!Also i will refer to your character as (character)
---
Hp:6780
---
Attack:(Character)has a long range shot gun that has the same range as Bo but a smaller radius(Character)Shotgun shoot's out 8 pellets that deals 260 per pellet.
---
Super:(Character)Goes on a rampage. It swings it's stop sign that deals 1350 damage around a 3x3 area with increased movement speed.
---
Star power: After (Character)Freed themselves they have gotten very alert of their surroundings,so whenever a enemy brawler is within (character') 6x6 area (character)gains a temporary speed boost.
---
Yes I wish they made that you can arrange the robots in the way you want but if you want to make more complex things use gene since he can pull the robots
---
Poco is not that weak. He does quite well in gem grab
---
what are you talking about üòÇ
---
The profile picture looks like a Pok√©mon
---
Mortis at lvl 10 is pretty much invincible
---
Damn, feels bad man
---
What*
---
He gives them each a party hat of their choosing, buys them whatever they ask for, and makes sure they all know they‚Äôre loved!
---
How dare you, he‚Äôs my third main
---
ich bin nicht ein Deutscher aber ich spreche Deutsch
---
How does this have gold and silver?
---
True. Skins dont belong in updates supercell. They dont fill slots for content and I'm fucking sick and tired of them being the bulk of an update.
---
It would take an hour to find a matchüôÉ
