I‚Äôm level 53 with no legendaries

---
At least matchmaking is so fast the exit button is useless
---
lol
---
*F intensifies*
---
Np
---
Hmm that is interesting, although I'm not sure if poison quite fits the overall lore of the character, perhaps explosives? In terms of returning over or under walls, it's more like going around the sides/corners. They don't go that far so it's not like Yoyo will be too far away even if it runs around a corner.  Might still be awkward though haha
---
Can someone add me that has this robo rumble, I am in need of some tokens
---
*why are we here...just to suffer.?*
---
I did mean Penny, but as the other poster said Nita would actually be better. 
---
This has to me my all time favorite format even though it‚Äôs so old and underrated
---
Who said they can
---
Yea pretty much *my friend has all 3 as a f2p and I‚Äôve spent 5 buckaroos stuck with Tara as my rarest brawler* 
---
I think that most people complains comes from solo showdown where he doesn‚Äôt  shine. 
---
whats this?????
---
If somebody wants to make a visual design for Joey and post it, be my guest! (Plz give credit to me for idea lol) I don't trust my artistic skills and I don't think I'd be doing this idea justice if I were to make a picture
---
That's such a good point! Current one is way more user friendly to the casual audience now that you say it! That may explain why Supercell would prefer the current UI to something more flashy like this! üòÖ
---
Apart from penny, I will have to calm the fbi for the other three
---
But I guess I‚Äôm kinda lucky cause I blew that 5 bucks on skins and gold and I have all brawlers but mortis and the legendaries 
---
I think I can‚Äôt say :/
---
Nice 
---
chester
---
Sweet, I like how in depth that concept went too.  Might have to refer to that one for the next concept I do.  Grabbing objects is a pretty neat idea.  
---
The real question is why do people play this game
---
by when?
---
I‚Äôll see what I can do 
---
Well...*I can already feel the judgement coming*....I too am a f2p and have all brawlers except legendaries, mortis and piper
---
Thanks! I figured it might be a good mechanic for defending against people chasing you down :)
---
Yes I did but you‚Äôre not finding 
---
Darryl Isn‚Äôt the best in brawl ball but still quite decent.
---

---
Using his super he is able to dribble like Mortis.
---
Hey can you add me?
---
Yeah, definitely didn't give the star power that much thought.  I was afraid to make it too OP haha.  Any suggestions?
---
But yeah at first glance, it DOES feel kinda cluttered but as we all know supercell developed 5 successful games (2 of those in which not so popular) so they know ecatly what they r doing 
---
Looks cool!
---
yes! and i dont have to go on my second account just because i want to look at my progression üòê
---
I think the book should actually say ‚Äúhow to get better internet‚Äù
---
I‚Äôll do it with you i‚Äôm Uchiha
---
How many people on this subreddit don‚Äôt know about the exploit? 
---
Yea I recently got to 3000 and in the box I unlocked before I hit 3k I got frank so my luck has been good recently but I‚Äôm just gonna have to play robo rumble with random because I have no friends that want to play lmao. And I‚Äôm f2p pretty much (skins give me no advantage and gold is overpriced)
---
But I‚Äôve been observing for a month now and it dead solid has not changed

Wow you beat people even that much higher than youü•µreal skill right here

My little brother got crow at 900 trophies

Im 3627

No mythic

One Frank

Did you consider SD?
---
Oh right

I'm dumb
---
You want a single button to be half the size of your screen?
---
As long as its there, New players will click on them to see what they are
---
Idk if I'm a weirdo or not but the first thing I do as soon as I get new game is check out every single buttons on my screen  and explore the UI
---

Mister Frank

I don't feel so good

Gonna be interesting, just hit 380 with shelly

sometimes I use it when theyre running straight away

His main niche (poison) takes WAYYY too long to come into serious effect. My best Crow carry was single-handedly shutting down a cold and rico solo. I would peek, hit, then run away. They were all fine until the poison ticked down ehough that they were half HP. One fell swoop later (pun intended), they were both dead. Took way too long until I reached the point where I could do that. You don't always have all the time in the world to let that poison effect really become effective

Very obese

Or code XCLBDM43
---
No plz, too close to each other
---
u alone then
---
He's kinda weak, even at lvl8 cause there are Shelly's and bulls
---
Even at death valley
---
u forgot to credit the person who actually took the ss and was talking in it 
---
Air pods on the hood
---
Eh, people steal with or without em. At least this post is time stamped.  
---
That 34 tho 
---
Yeah crow is super hard to play in showdown because you his chip damage doesn‚Äôt work well to kill players when the other players attack you
---
What can I say except, your welcome......
---
I think it will be on monday
---
no but i did it 
---
Yeah I think the next one is coming out in February's update.  I heard it has a grappling hook.
---
At least you have frank, I don‚Äôt have any epic, mythic or legendary at the same trophy range 4200 
---
These are so amazing! 
---
Eeeeel THAAAANOOOOS
---
Would‚Äôve gotten more upvotes if you edited the beginning.
---
Nothing in the community talk gave any indication that the next brawler is a genie. Endless lex got special knowledge about the next brawler the genie thing is complete BS

he ate his hat

That screenshot was on my second account didnt care to do it

Thank youüôèüèª

Ye
---
would be great
---
I actually doubt it's a remodel, It looks nothing like rico. When others were remodeled they still looked similar. Bot 5 doesn't look anywhere near rico, I think it's a new brawler
---
No it was in an interview he offered it and the person being interviewed said it was interesting and he'd see what he would do
---
What is this?
---
Jesus man that sucks
---
Oh oops I meant that as a comment on the original post
---
This is awesome! Instantly thought of Back to the Future!
---
Neither implying you have more experience by saying 
---
Smart idea, but are you sure it won't be hard to defend the safe with only a dynamike and Nita who can't use her super? Idk, I was thinking that **Pam** can be the one who uses her spawnable since she can better defend the safe than Nita. Also, would Tara be a better replacement than dynamike since she probably better defend with her super? Just my thoughts, creative idea however!
---
This is a repost. This UI also looks terrible. It‚Äôs way to complicated and isn‚Äôt even slightly good looking.

Well done man!

106 trophies? Those are rookie numbers. I lost 150 trophies on shelly and bull(each lost 150 separate). Lost 50 on Darryl and 39 on el primo. Went down 70 trophies on bo. And now I‚Äôm depressed.
---
With what proof?
---
I agree, the complete lack of burst damage means that you need a long time to kill any targets, and you have to be left alone or else they can kill steal and take the power cubes, or they can kill you as you lack any burst damage or HP.
---
it is like the opposite of Leon, weak attacks that are strong over a long period of time as opposed to high damage attacks that lack poison 
---
Ohhh niceee YAAAAASS very cool magician grandmother 
---
r/unexpectedjojo

same
---
A good UI is user friendly. Too much is going on here. Looks fancy and all but I feel tired just looking on it 
---
which is why the team reworked him, now he will be a thrower that is used more to control the map 
---
Yeah, add me. Just need 1 more

why wouldn‚Äôt you cross post it

Can u get me new link

No lol it was coincidence he says that randomly but that would ne a cool easter egg

Lol! We need a brawl stars animated series and this exchange will be in Yoyo's debut episode.

---
A buff would be welcome to crow mains but imo its not needed. Compared to the best brawlers in the game hes weak but hes average overall. He's very viable on many game modes.
---
I would appreciate that so much dude! Are you gonna post a video to your channel or what?
---
Press F to pay respects
---
That shirt design is really nice! Where did you buy it? 
---
Crow's star power is actually quite good. Crow's star power makes it so quite a few brawlers take one extra hit to kill Crow (I seem to remember hearing this in a Kairos video), and it's not too hard to keep enemies poisoned. It also benefits your teammates
---
It seems like a terreria knock off but i like it. I think it should be a ninja instead of Jessies turret because a ninja wielding a yo-yo seems sick 
---
I agree, but he is the worst legendary by far, and worse than some mythical brawlers. He is the worst brawler you can get in a drop as he lowers your chances of getting another legendary for a long time 
---
Idk actually. It is nice photoshop but it feels to clumped and I think the Brawl Stars team is trying to avoid that
---
Somebody leaked it to be on the 28th 
---

Can this please be the new Spike Model. I mean they did it with Rico-, I mean Thiccochet, so why not Spike? 
---
I earned maxed time long before this and it was using the mortis kite strat. This is not cheating. It‚Äôs being smart. Also, this strat is not always 100% effective so I prefer to just play because I can get max tokens without. 
---
Though I wasn‚Äôt really given a whole lot of credit, I am the ‚Äúyou‚Äù in the image above, and I was trying to do it on my level 1 mini account that doesn‚Äôt really stand a chance in robo rumble due to lack of upgrades. 
---
It is a nice strat when you don‚Äôt have the means to get max tokens‚Äîcouldn‚Äôt care less about max time. Step down off your holier-than-thou soapbox because you‚Äôre not impressing anyone. 
---
Where and how did u do this
---
I'm gonna be honest with you, after seeing this I don't know if I'm gonna be able to fall asleep at night anymore.
---
It got patched.
---
What the... I'm not trying to impress anyone üòÇ What is even happening
---
Kairos how did you even manage to make an acapella! Thats like some next level stuff. Anyways Its great! Love the lyrics
---

Yeah...they said "skins" would be coming in February, but that doesn't necessarily mean the update.

Ok, but where's Tara?
---
You screwed it up. Why do you have to be so Tara Bull?
---
Idea: awesome ; name: meh
---
Sounds unique and exciting to me :D

I'll do you one better, who's tara?

ikr i popped off after getting that

I'll do you one better, why is Tara?

Thanks for your art post! If you are not the creator of this work, please make sure that you have included the source, or to  comment it here! Unsourced art may be removed if you are not the creator.
---
I think the star power was really cool and put a big emphasis on his special feature, the return damage 
---
First off, Darryl is nothing like bull anymore except for his main attack, which is still different in quite a few ways. I would still change the main attack so it applies a different concept. Maybe have him throw two at a time or something.
---
okay now that was un poco bad.
---
Or just normal Dynamike and Nita
---
That remodel looks so bad 
---
Lol he did it on purpose. Its a bug
---
Guys don‚Äôt upvote. This is not worth
---
I laughed my ass off
---
At around 2000 and I don‚Äôt have spike, literally only brawler I wanted, got Leon after getting Nita and got crow when Leon was in the store 
---
Nothing is wrong with Darryl
---
Thiccochet is IRONY
---
How much is the pink spike do you know?
---
Yea exactly 
---
I understand it man but as someone who loves using Leon, trust me when I say this, it‚Äôs not much of a nerf, it‚Äôs like reducing his effectiveness by about 13% before star power 
---
Lol everyones missing a t every 3 lines
---
Rico meets the new THICCO
---
I can help
---
Probably the best post i've seen in here
---
He's in the video with the balance changes. He's the fat robot 
---
Can you please send me the link to it? It looks amazing 
---
letsgo!!
---
Ok
---
Yes my hand is very tired 
---
Trust me. Its not a bug. It also depends on the amount of brawlers you have and they‚Äôre type
---
Its only fair. I mean she dumped Rico cuz he is fat now.
---
I use an iPhone 5
---
Yeah that's not fitting very well on my screen. Also, mistapping battles is too easy unless you make it a two-step button, and at that point it might as well be the way it already is.

How long have you been playing? Gz anyway

Primo jumping into enemy spawn, but it‚Äôs a good thing.

How am I supposed to "Get on GOOGLE PLAY" or "Download in APP STORE"?

Dude. This is a great idea and addition to the robot family.
---
I paid that üò¢

But its probably gonna 'spike'.
---
Happy Cake Day BTW
---
It means that it's going from 30% to 40% which is a total change of 10%. 10% is 33.3% of 30.

Well, I retouched Nita by accepting feedback.  I'm ashamed of my mistake...

I agree with the part that all brawlers should get spooky but spike is shaped like a ghost üëª i was thinking that leon is more of a lizard ü¶é that could be invisible with changing colors üòÇ

Of course, each brawler excels in a few aspects and is weaker in others. For Poco he's good at crowd control but stuggles to burst enemies down. What probably happened is that you won unfavourable matchups so far simply because your opponents were worse than you.
---
You simply need to get better. Pick your battles, dont face rush a tank as Poco and play around your team.
---
Tbh I just think that after many wins and one loss the game is starting to make me lose, so it wouldn‚Äôt be efficient continuing playing.
---
Yeah, right now most people have that skin
---
I wouldn‚Äôt say she is weak, if played right she can be good
---
Can someone explain this to me, I have no idea what is going on.
---
yes
---

Cant tell if this is a joke or not lmao
---
Thiccochet was stolen from me and I don‚Äôt even know what to do anymore. I never posted anything about it, just some heavily upvoted comments about it and now people are karma farming thiccochet memes.

When is the update coming??

I guess but still no point of wasting money on a game.

Much better would be hold down a shoulder button to use the aim stick as super.

WHY CAN'T I DO THIS ON BLUESTACKS?! 
---
Eventually this is gonna spread like bowsette and its gonna get r34'd folks.

What master do i serve? What am i supposed to say, Nita?

This pic made me realize that the normal Rico doesn‚Äôt wear clothes 0-o

Did you use any app for designing that? If yes, please tell me which app you used.

You got a boyfriend
---
We have a bruh moment
---
Repost lmao
---
I've actually accidentally posted this on the brawl talk page, but here's what i think of the update (specifically the brawl ball change)
---
1.
---
I think its ok for kicking the ball to cost one ammo bar, but make it so that ammo bar can refill faster than the normal reload time. For example: Shelly has a reload time of 1.7 sec (i think), if someone using Shelly were to kick the ball, it would cost one ammo bar, but that ONE ammo bar will refill 50% faster 0.85 sec (or maybe 25% faster, 1.275 sec). This faster reload will only happen for the ONE ammo bar used for kicking the ball.
---
2
---
Or maybe a more balanced option is to make the reload time for kicking the ball equal for all brawlers. So every brawler will use 1 ammo bar for kicking the ball, but will only take ~1 sec to reload that bar.
---
I opened 40 boxes and I didnt even get piper the only epic that Im missing smh
---
Shared on @brawlbear. giving you clear credit and respecting your piece of art. great job, can‚Äôt wait to see future brawler concepts!üëçüèº

I hope you'll get one soon!
---

---
Good
---
Bull: I dont feel so gooo....
---
Yes?
---

---
Face is awesome!) 
---
I wouldn't be surprised if they added Primo, but Spike...
---
agree
---
We really need this...
---
But in files are more 2 brawlers data mined.
---
We need piper. 
---
**This is spam!**

u/khala1234 stole this post from here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/aj59ph/these_low_trophy_10s_are_the_worst/
---
and put it on his website to earn ad money.  Instead of just posting the image.  Thief!
---
It was suppose to be a joke but whatever.
---
Didn‚Äôt they say they approve of teaming because it‚Äôs a legitimate strategy?
---
Not saying I approve but I‚Äôm pretty certain that‚Äôs what Supercell said.
---
It is annoying after a certain amount of trophies it should be based on total trophy count 
---
Because Island Invasion 
---
I agree. This is a game for adults and it should stay that way. /s
---
Happy gatekeeping.

He lost his hat, he got -crippling- depression and he ate lots of borgars from macdondald then he became -big chungus- thiccochet
---
The people should be angrier
---
Thanks a lot for this man. I‚Äôm down to play if anyone wants to 
---
Why Darryl?? 
---
Just wondering... do people want this because it would be helpful or improve the game or just to add more stuff to the game? I like the current simplicity.

once you go above 400 expect to be playing with top players
---
Only For Colt, brock, and long rage Brawler 
---
the primo is just a dumb troll. what i sometimes do is break them out 
---
He gonna find another girl and he won‚Äôt miss ya!
---
Brawler also has a super
---
And we will report you
---
I didn't.
---
It is not punished, over the 450 trophies showdown you just have to team, because everyone teams, so it is allowed
---
Shit
---
I woulda aim that gun at me head and end it
---
Big game 
---
Nice reference 
---
Great drawing in general but if his super is gonna be a potion, it has to be on his back.
---
You probably know this but I just mentioned it 
---
Me too
---
Hahaha
---
No no, neither, wait fo it to drop from a box, it's not worth putting money
---
my handsome boi üòÄ thank you üòç

Looks awesome.

If you add shadows, will be even better
---
Dear god, where is his hat?
---
FBI OPEN UP! (also part is just this) 
---
She has a lot of plugs UHM BULLETS I mean!
---
Hello sans
---
Ah, R34. I wish it never existed 
---
Her ultimate would be giga shot a bullet that will go forever until some one is hit so it could break through walls and when it hits it does 2000 damage but it takes 30 hits to be ready
---
She would have 2800 health
---
What a style!
---
She looks evil
---
Be my Love 
---
That would be great, too!
---
lol damn
---
nice
---
maybe I put too much colors but you understand the idea ^^ 
---
The art looks so nice i though it was a legit sneak peek
---
This would look great!
---
It‚Äôs just a game bro you gotta chill out man
---
Umm I think I lost a few brain cells
---
30 hits might take super long
---
Maby 15
---
Yes... Less consistency and less focus on individual skill.  What a great addition to SOLO Showdown.  /s
---
._.
---
The best brawlwr idea!
---
He use to have a sombero hat im pretty sure
---
Good bot
---
Sound logic has no place on this subreddit.  Away with you!
---
What do you guys think will she be a fast shooter or a slow shooter I just put what I would like also I gave your post a lot of comments so people will look
---
Oh all the kids who doesn't understand jokes/irony 
---
Look up primo robo rumble glitch on YouTube. 
---
Piper is the only purple I need. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd use her much, but I really wanna get her just to have all purple heroes
---
Hahaha mastermove
---
Wow,that's cool
---
that‚Äôs fair, maybe a rework or something, because her only being viable in one mode is not enough( maybe decrease her max damage and increase her damage at medium rang so she can be a bit more versatile idk)

Lol noob

Mabye.
---
I wanna a nita Winnie the pooh bear skin now
---
What's the purpose of circling in the end? With 2 brawlers left. 
---
Ahahah i feel so sorry for you Man, just of one second
---
I lost all my tickets i only have one left 
---
If we gonna do it we must do it right 
---
don't like ricochet's remodel. ; ;
---
I‚Äôll join
---
This would be so much fun
---
I need it.
---
To remodel characters as f2p...
---
I thought the Thiccochet thing was a joke, is he really getting remodeled??
---
**T H I C C O C H E T**

"random"
---
/r/soulknight
---
Agreed. Like maybe 2 bounty maps combined 
---
Bad idea 
---
Nonono at least add health in that
---
God, "cards"
---
I have better probabilities but I haven't find new brawlers yet. (Missing 5 brawlers) 
---
Im up
---
It‚Äôs a robot rumble exploit where as el primo you super into and areas at the top of the map were u are surrounded my walls, and it makes all the robots just stand there as long as the other two players are lower by the safe, so this bull didn‚Äôt know the exploit and thought i got stuck and used his super to get me out

Well, lol, i play since first day of beta and i just discovered yesterday how to put it, therefor i‚Äôm wearing one. OGs don‚Äôt put leon flair
---
?
---
Sorry, i cant do it right now. I may be able to in a few hours.
---
Youvget max rewards at 6:15 so you can stop there
---
I absolutely love it, good job!
---
Ok , DM when you ready . Thx
---
Of course. 
---
I really hope so, don‚Äôt make my boy rico fat D:
---
Tara and brock = Penny maybe she is albinos
---
but 
---
IDK how colt and piper make leon i guess piper wasnt loyal
---
I did know. He'll only be weaker in brawl ball, but better in every other game mode.
---
This map would work very well as Feast or Famine: Bulls, Shellys and the cousins ‚Äã‚Äãwould go into the middle and the last survivor would stay there until the end. The major difference from partying or hunger is that involvement in the center is more open.
---
Yeah! That would be cool...
---
Well, I do not know, maybe because I am Russian myself?
---
Done
---
Me too, maybe that ‚Äúthiccochet‚Äù is a complete new brawler? Let‚Äôs pray!
---
I dunno if you are trolling or being serious 
---
Ok thx guys !
---
That would be awesome, but hard to organise, what with all the different game modes and all. But then we could have some sort of Clan Reward Box that would be same as a normal box: PP, Coins, maybe a brawler + bonus
---
I spend $10+ and 250 gems on EMOTES on CR 
---
I spend few dollars on Holiday Pack on bs 
---
Wait there is something wrong here. Mortis is his highest brawler. This is beyond science

It was already 69 times in this sub :/

What do you mean? As in when you're between 0-1000 you can ask for 1 PP and then 1001-2000 2 PP?

The last should be people WHO don‚Äôt think crow needs a buff

Who said i was bad?

Oh well good for you üòÜ, doesn‚Äôt mean that everyone is russian tho. Isn‚Äôt it easier To ask someone where is he from? Anyway italian
---
I thought It would be cool because it is nothing that benefits in the Game so people wouldn't be saying: "lucky beta players" and It Is something nice
---
You wouldn‚Äôt be complaining if u were good 
---
cool
---
Your teacher unlocked Leon
---
Ok and? You may have 10.5k trophies but you probably don‚Äôt even know how to use your brawlers the right way
---
Is it good in general?
---
That can be Shellys skin instead 
---
I see
---
But there is someone that is shipping piper and ricochet. You broke the chain
---
He is getting a huge nerf so that might solve it (February)
---
I have Tara but t only like 2-3 I think
---
Yep 
---
How do you still have tokens left after that
---
His older brother saw Thiccochet
---
No
---
I have darryl at 130 - try me biatch
---
the number of times i've backstabbed someone with colt is a big number
---
It's an ok idea just they're called clubs not clans
---
 i my opinion leon is piper¬¥s son because he¬¥s main attack is similar to her but in close range.
---
Thicco
---
Mannn i have 4150 trophies and morties is my only mythic ... Whyyyy supercell
---
everyone has an opinion
---
We can do this one if we find a Jessie or Nita (I can play any of those, lvl 5 and 7 respectively) and it should be an easy win
---

i win pretty much all of my games, its just boring. did you even read the post?
---
I do all the time and it usually works well. (More in Bounty and Showdown than Heist and BB though)
---
Yeah but tbh like anyone above 4K right now would have a gold name, wouldn‚Äôt really be special. Maybe something less notable, like a profile picture
---
It happens when you keep holding the super button before you died and after you died, when you respawn it appears as normal attack.
---
Perfect
---
Lmao they're shit just get a USB C/microUSB/Lightning to HDMI adapter and use your monitor

Game room code is XV65TYAM

Where did u get that ?

aye thiccochet got a new skin‚ùÑÔ∏è

Why couldn‚Äôt it be named Eugene!!!

---
Poco Remodel
---
It‚Äôs have not has
---
I‚Äôm sorry but Bull and Primo are not anti teamers. In fact, they are team formers as they usually are the ones to win boxes and get a lot of power ups and therefore teams are formed to take them down. 
---
Bone Tunnel was my fav map in the whole game tho. When I pushed barley to 1K, 250 of that was from bone tunnel
---
A bit annoyed they didn‚Äôt call football bull footbull 
---
RIP ricochet it‚Äôs confirmed. What did they do?? üò≠

Just take a screenshot of it and post that. No one wants to click on a link

Why is Brawl Stars making me pick between Pam, Thiccochet, and Gene?

Well it‚Äôs not surprising mortis was the first brawler to make it over 1000 cups. Pro mortis and noob mortis is like the distance between heaven and earth

It was just explained that the rate you get keys isn‚Äôt changing meaning it just takes longer to fill up completely. So now you only have to get on every 24 hours to get all your keys instead of getting on every 12 hours. But you won‚Äôt be getting more keys if you get on every 12 hours anyway.

The new brawler looked like lancer

---
You heard Mortis's voice?
---
Ok,I need to buy his skin before the price rise
---
I usually play as a Vulture with Bull or Primo and it works out great for me. Wonder why they aren't included there since after a tough fight, other Brawlers will usually just back off before engaging with someone with so much health.
---
Real go see an video's update
---
Kairos‚Äô video
---
I watched Coach Cory‚Äôs sneak peek video, and that was one of the new maps. They‚Äôre basically the exact same map plus there‚Äôs a little heart symbol meaning a community map. So it‚Äôs basically got to be mine.

Space out content for it doesn‚Äôt get boring

This needs more upvotes. Funniest thing i read today

its getting removed?
---
Yes, u/KairosTime_Gaming mentioned it on his latest video
---
But he has legs 
---
Oh huh now I hear fitness too.  It would make more sense if he said that too

Unlike Ricochet, Thiccochet has brought loads of popcorn for us!
---
Same here! It‚Äôs being incredible u/Frank_supercell
---
That mechanic for Hoverboarddude from leaked Brawlers
---
Thats what i want to change
---
I dont think it will.And i hope it wont,cuz i am holding my gems to get it 
---
Idk man I mean there‚Äôs a couple nerfs that should be made, supercell isn‚Äôt taking eye to it though 
---
They can‚Äôt access the new brawler, even in their Dev Build of the game
---
I liked him with his hat ;( but yeah, maybe that‚Äôs the reason
---
Cory said that it is hidden and it is not in the dev build so it is not a legendary 
---
when i genes sillouhette i immedietly thought of lancer
---
nah, if anything, he became a HUNK of junk with balls in his trunk and also, T H I C C 
---
If it worked it would be fine we lost seconds after
---
He looks great, stop bandwagoning
---
Thiccochet you‚Äôre the real MVP! Don‚Äôt consume any more hats please!
---
Most people who say Crow needs a buff don‚Äôt have him unlocked yet, or don‚Äôt know how to play him. 
---
On the surface, Crow is a low health, low damage, high speed (Same as Mortis) Brawler. Whose star power is weak and unnecessary. And in comparison to Spike and Leon, Crow is ‚Äòweak.‚Äô 
---
But Crow is a pretty strong Brawler, who is very high skill but when used proficiently can be a powerhouse of a Brawler. I think if anything they  could decrease the number of shots it takes to charge Crow‚Äôs super or give him a passively charging super so that he can jump in and out, more often. 
---
As it stands now, Crow is the most mediocre legendary Brawler. But the bar is set really high, as both Spike and Leon are strong. Most people argue that their both broken, but I think Spike is balanced but strong and Leon deserved a nerf but I think they did it wrong.

---
Please make the Valentine Poco skin 30 gems
---
Brock is really popular and probably sells a lot of skins. My best guess
---
Anyone else wants an OG Rico skin called Ricochet in the game, like what happened with Mortis hat?

I know the glitch. Invite me G8LGOUJC

Is this confirmed?

Tot Pam il rupeeeee la mancareeee, vezi ca are grapple

Yes

Where did you get the Crow remodel from?

Well I mean organized teaming.... enough said 
---
I'm so famous now!
---
Can you like add a special event that a brawler is an assassin and all others are the sheriff?

Yeah

He looked too much like Barley

Also kinda weird how his icon in game rn looks more like the new skin especially how the eye is x-ed out but it‚Äôs just a vertical line on the icon. Also the scarf is a solid color in the icon and not in the current model
---
32 is the max per key which is like 6 mins 10-15 sec don‚Äôt remember exactly. 20 keys is 640 
---
But Bo still got his chest line
---
I‚Äôm not allowed to say bc it‚Äôs a popular opinion? There‚Äôs people that like it and people that don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs not bandwagoning, I watched the video 2 mins after it came out. 
---
I love some attack revamps, but I felt like the frank and nita ones were a bit over flashy

Really good‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

u/thiccochet

Dunno why ppl are so hyped about the new hero, like it's going to drop from a free box. We will have to buy it 
---
Source: Coach Cory on Yt, showing Dev Build
---
I bought it for 30 gems , they probaly make is 80 gems after the rework üòÖ
---
I'm at 5k but I don't have any brawler better than super rare. You are lucky. 
---
Depends on the brawler tbh
---
Rico has mortisidus now
---
It‚Äôs a development build
---
He probably was, that‚Äôs why the genie is just speculation. Nothing is confirmed. But Ryan said he left a big hint about a brawler earlier in the video. And so far, the most likely hint would be the genie, although we aren‚Äôt sure. What else do you think Ryan‚Äôs hint was referring to?
---
Ouch
---
Hahah so true
---
But Thiccochet, why is your flair still showing Ricochet? 
---
Wheres the camper tanks
---
It would be cool if he throws his lamp as like a teleport similar to crows jump
---
https://link.brawlstars.com/invite/friend/en?tag=9V28V8Q8&amp;token=tx9f26tz
---
I'm down
---
Yeah it‚Äôs confirmed just finished watching brawl talk
---
Check out vids on YouTube they give all of his voice lines
---
It‚Äôs Rico, but looking at it from another angle, it‚Äôs actually really creative and I think it actually looks better than the original
---
Technically not new, but don't forget Sakura Spike
---
Congrats! :)
---
They're redoing rico's current skins to coincide with the remake. Think they did this to Bull's blonde outfit and everyone that owned the skin got grandfathered to the new one. 
---
They raised the price of that bull skin and now they're probably gonna do it to the new rico skin.
---
I‚Äôm buying
---
I love how text for an image is here. Post the el primo thing not this! /s
---
True story
---
Yeah! But have to move on now xD
---
This is the only bad thing about a new update. Having to watch all the videos 
---
Well I do declare!
---
They don't have a Thiccochet flair for some reason
---
Gustion (will be posting my other concept later)
---
I knew as soon as I saw the video this was the case
---
Yes, it does
---
By far my favorite new skin
---
My pleasure :)
---
I know right? Can't wait to get my hand on the Valentine Poco!
---
u can jump into a different section of wall
---
True true
---
I wish I had her!! Good job!
---
Am playin dog no worries 
---
Hey, and how much do you think the new poco skin will cost? Just I‚Äôm thinking of buying some gems 
---
Thank you very much üëä
---
In the brawlers skin selection thingy there's only 3 shots
---
Thats how mafia works
---
It is lol
---
no... he marries shelly 
---
Pink spike is getting remodeled into sakura spike - watch kairos/Rey/lex/bentimm/Cory/some other brawl stars youtuber s video and they'll show u update changes on dev build he skin was also in gameplay footage
---
My leon.    https://www.reddit.com/user/marc3shx/comments/akftl0/leon/?utm_source=reddit-android
---
I thought of that too, but his main attack seems to be a punch, how is he supposed to split it, or jump over walls with that? Maybe they changed him (?)
---
I cri every time
---
Nice
---
It‚Äôs 15
---
That‚Äôs actually a good idea and about the power station another idea instead of that is he could  throw something at the ground giving his teammates in the range of it a boost of speed and damage like poco super 
---
Yea dood F2P And I have almost every skin in the game
---
Just buy golden rico while hes 30 gems
---
I really like this &lt;3
---
lol this is so dumb but I love it.
---
let it shrivel up and die
---
It was one of my favorites.
---
Well done sir, I really like the sack on Leons head ;)
---
When you think about it, they brought brock's shades back
---
I prefer the new look actually.
---
What are we looking at?
---
I bought the same box, I GOT NOTHING
---
OEISBDSYEYDHDBDTAH WMSPZKS XNZLZP

What is the glitch?

It will stay at 80 gems. 
---
Brock obama maybe? 
---
r/LootStars.
---
If it will be added it wont be soon because supercell released the new maps üò™| this is good map
---
Toasty is right, It's a Ricochet remodel (Ricochet's name was also changed to just Rico). Thiccochet looks way to similar to Ricochet to be a new brawler (Blue and Green attire, Odd looking pistol, head shape, etc).
---
The new brawler we're getting is a Genie named Gene, who was the grappling hook brawler that was leaked..
---
Wanna know too
---
His hat is wrapped the same as Tara‚Äôs mask

I used up 200 tickets, didn't get a single group that knew what to do :(
---
What should it be reworked to then?
---
That‚Äôs a pretty simple fix
---
There are community round tables, they act like them but come rarely and normally around update times like this update, there was one last Friday. Again these normally come out when the devs have an update ready and they host these to discuss different topics and some update hints. So go on YouTube and look up brawl stars community roundtable. And they will discuss questions that were posted on reddit and they read comments on the community‚Äôs ideas and opinions. Questions like what new brawler ideas would you like to see, or how do you feel about the fidget spinning leon. And its just a great discussion and ryan(a community manager is always present in these and drops hints or sneak peaks on what is coming and his own opinions on these questions so we know what there priorities are. Like he will say if an idea from a community comment is something they are focussed on or if its not a priority compared to other thongs they need to do. 
---
Hats aren't free. Gotta pay up /s.
---
Sweaty hands?
---
Bull... Aside from Pam it's probably the only thing Poco can't kill if used correctly.
---
Is this comfirmed?
---
Happy cake day!
---
New brawler is either an onion or thiccochet 
---
Cluster bomb will probably be the next one

I'm actually dying this is so funny

I actually think the new rico model looks good now that we've seen the new model in proper detail. Gene sounds pretty cool too
---
You are a man of culture
---
He looks amazing 
---
Loaded rico, not so much still ok tho
---
And his money
---
Genie does as you wish
---
No. Only Spike, Colt, Rico and Poco are getting a remodel. Bo will probably get one next update.
---
Where is Leon's new skin? smh
---
Lol if you watch the video his super is a grappling hook
---
Gained weight after divorce and became thiccochet
---
He did say? He said it's the same so the only difference is instead of playing once every 12 hrs it's once every 24. Pretty straight forward
---
Can you fly?
---
I like how his name is simply Rico now.
---
OMG NICE IDEA!!!! I hope supercell sees this
---
Get rid of noobs who don't know about the exploit pls and thx
---
Another regular day at the office... Ow ow ow
---
What are you going to do?
---
Kill Robo Boss
---
Seduce him
---
Just got him with 30 big boxes left, so I opened the big boxes :P
---
If that's what he will do than he would be op with bull( or any other tank) also than if he wants to attack a bull (or any other tank)he will probably die
---
Please tell me this is sarcasm
---
Maybe he used his super on the heist safe

A Brawl Stars Podcast , Balance Update Breakdown!!  https://anchor.fm/money1834/episodes/Balance-Update-Breakdown-e31jac
---
heck yes
---
Ok were not gonna acknowledge the fact that mortis wasnt just a tad bit broken in brawl ball?
---
Lmao why do you bet 10 and 20 tickets with randoms ? That‚Äôs a real bad idea dude
---
Just watch the video, you can see how he works
---
Personally, I liked the old one more but at least he is a weaponized gum ball machine. that‚Äôs pretty dope
---
Your map was really good my man, it was one of the most fun and interesting Bounty maps. Hopefully they're simply doing a rotation of some kind and yours will come back again someday, don't lose hope!
---
Yeah, it would be sad if these maps were just gone. We have never seen so many maps pulled at once. Usually when they pull maps its one or two and for a good reason. Either it was broken or they didn‚Äôt feel like it fit with the game mode. And of those few that were pulled were brought back. Two bounty maps that were pulled were brought back and stormy plains is being added back. So I believe there is only one map that is still not in the game anymore which was sapphire plains. A gem grab map that looked almost like snake prairie. Imagine fighting for gems with so many bushes. It was pulled probably because they didn‚Äôt like that meta for gem grab and it was the only map that wasn‚Äôt in a gem mine environment so they thought it didn‚Äôt belong. Besides that map unless there was a map from day one that was pulled. Then there was no other map that was officially gone so my idea that we will see these maps back could be possible.
---
Mine is Dragon Knight Jessie
---
I wish I didn‚Äôt spend my 30 gems now cuz that Rico skin looks cool
---
he *t h i c c *
---
dumb dumb
---
Pay to win? Like crow?
---
dumb 
---
But it's a free 13m 14s...?
---
Sure thing! Please let me know what use you make out of it!
---
In the video a blue like thingy, probably a genie, pulls an opponent brawler closer
---
And Darryl
---
No but you save 50 gems
---
Nobody knows yet but likely mythic 
---
Tara is the genie's slave
---
I've been patient for a month and I am tired of seeing everyone enjoying the roster of heroes, while I am sitting here with the rares and Rico
---
You should have also added the lvl 100 golden mafia boss skin at the end
---
Bcs if that happens its moslty bcs new players pkay 1 bralwer and gets them 300+ and olay in bull 
---
lshit maps...
---
Pre remodel ricochet should be lv 1 crook, after remodel rico should be lv 10 hitman and loaded rico should be lv 100 boss
---
At least thats just my take
---
ONLY A MONTH???? Chill dude... My friend's been patient for 6 months...
---
You posted this shot 3 times
---
I have no problems with the mushrooms or meteors, but I've definitely had Energy Drink Bounty games where it seemed like every single one spawned on the enemy team's side even when we were losing, which was frustrating. I really like the idea of the Energy Drink so I don't want them to remove it, and I'd rather them simply tweak the coding algorithms to make them spawn in more centralized areas, or maybe to make the spawn favor the team that is losing to help support comebacks. Currently though the RNG of their spawn really can swing a game unfairly.
---
Only a month???? Chill dude... My friend's been patient for 6 months...

I expect to at least experience a new brawler once in a while. I am not asking for legendaries, just anything other than rares
---
They all turning into gold

I know xd but don‚Äôt worry will get one soon

No you didn‚Äôt, it was leaked weeks ago.

We‚Äôll

Just about in the same boat as you but with less brawlers.

I have 29 gems ;(

Won‚Äôt happen, but makes sense.

Been playing almost since it went global and I don‚Äôt ever remember seeing this map in rotation:/ that sucks ... oh well the new ones look pretty schweet!

That's awesome man, sure it will be a ton of fun. Btw, where can I make maps for the game?
---
I think the idea of anti teamers is like the champions you don‚Äôt form teams with. 
---
Both can kill you pretty quickly. I personal don‚Äôt team with Bull or Primo
---
I remember upvoting it great job man 
---
&gt;420 Super Damage 
---
Nice.
---
Remember kids if you spend $2 you get a level 100 boss as soon as the update comes rather than $5 later you‚Äôre welcome kids who stole their parents credit card
---
I miss this...
---
Optimally you would play him as a vulture. Since he has such high mobility. 
---
The arrows are so scared of Bo's chest line they just fly away
---
Where did you get them from
---
Yep, it also predicted the new SD map. Gene has an attack similar to Nita‚Äôs which I‚Äôm guessing does more damage(1400) but has a smaller range. His super pulls people in if it connects(doing 420 damage) which goes well with his short range. His star power will launch him over walls I believe, which can help him get out of sticky situations by knocking him backwards.
---
You can still get him for 30. He isn‚Äôt thicochet yet
---
16. He had all super rares and Piper and that was IT. It was difficult af to grind for him in a situation like that
---
I played this map like once. I don't see any point for them to remove maps. There should only ever be more maps
---
He‚Äôs the hook guy character. His basic is a shotgun blast and his super is a hook.
---
When crow gets remodeled  he will
---
I never team. I prefer playing on my own. In fact, that is the reason behind me playing Solo. 
---
Poprico
---
Oh shoot! Maybe they will just say his original costume is a girl, they could say his new skin is a trap, or they could just not have a voice for him ü§î
---
Unfortunately, Global Launch will not be included in this update.
---
It only apparead once with the energy drink event. R.I.P. At least they are removing Shooting Star, cancer map who always appeared lol
---
Nah crow has quite long range, so in general it would only do a bit less than pipers 
---
Mystery solved
---
I agree, add Daryl to the list as well
---

It‚Äôs would be cool for some credit!

Before Drinking/After Drink

The new one is 80 so buy gold rico now and save 50 gems
---
Especially with the other guy who made the brock skin... like why aren‚Äôt they posting that they‚Äôre taking the suggestions...?
---
tbh darryl isn't that bad, just really difficult to use.

The most likely reason they are removing hats is that they can add themed hats for skins, such as popcorn rico
---
So in other words the old gold skin will be automatically replaced with new one?
---
Leon?
---
Your drawing was first thing that came to mind when I saw the announcement!
---
#F
---
He is difficult, which most people just say he is crap and don't use him. But he is a lot of fun to play.
---
I see. My phone works differently and separates it so it all adds up to 100.
---
I just think they'll remove them all and add a brawler who is a hatter.
---
Yep, I have all the other brawlers maxed, so lots of Leon power points. Like 30-60 per big box
---
wondering the same thing, I bought it for 30, lets hope I made the right decision
---
But what about bugs, what do they all really want to know?
---
No way they would do that, hatter would be op af
---
They actually buffed alot of brawler this update.
---
I'm short of 6 gems. Dammit!
---
Who‚Äôs Darrel?
