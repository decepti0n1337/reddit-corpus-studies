What is this brwal stars you talk of?
---
This is already MADE! Stop IT! I know you know about THIS!
---
Bro there is no problem on creating *almost* the same meme with a different template. And your meme got 2.7k upvotes IN THE BRAWL STARS subreddit. That's pretty rare you know. Stop being envious and let him have his credit for the meme he did
---
Almost 13k
---
Good boi üëåüëåüëå
---
Emoji good, anti emoji team bad
---
There is a friend of mine who got crow in a big box he bought for 30 gems.
---
I never talked to him again
---
No. You can get it in about 50 boxes, why are you wasting gems?
---
And:
---
\- Ticketed event
---
\- Present Plunder
---
\- Graveyard shift (I know it was removed, but why not leave it for friendly games if you still wanna play that with friends?)
---
Crow: removes the use of bushes/invisiblity for 4 seconds after every attack, decreases attack damage by 20% for 4 seconds after attacking, fastest normal move speed, almost 9 tile range in attack
---
Sandy: spawns a bush over large area for 8 seconds that can heal freinds or damage enemies, tank speed, bit more range than frank
---
I don't follow
---
lol
---
this makes tick look like a sweetest thing in the world and not a annoying peice of garbage
---

Is it just me, or has the amount of bad fandoms skyrocketed since the update? Laggy teammates, AFK teammates, bad bots, game throwers, people that have 500+ trophies on a brawler and *cant fucking use their super*
---
Argh
---
???? he is saying that if u buy a skin that cost 50000 star points like golden mecha bo, the background of the unlocking animation will be yellow like unlocking a legendary brawler
---
Somebody should make this meme but have fire in the bottom
---
that's baby food
---
Because bot cant function very well in this mode
---
Like a meteor targeting them and they'll just stand there
---
So I think thats why Supercell didnt add event modify YET
---
But it's just a skin, wanna know what's sad, the fact that I don't have star shelly and have 2x the trophies of someone who does and he has mortis while I dont
---
Yeah, there's no point in making it higher
---
Yeah, they look ugly af
---
beat me to it
---
abomination
---
Yesfire
---
Maybe draw tara's shadow next to her healing her
---
Congrats!! ü•≥üéâ
---
Maybe it's for higher contrast. It may be hard for some people to see the bushes in the map "preview". (I don't know what to call it.) Personally, it's hard for me sometimes to see low-contrast details in games and images. That's just my take though. But it could cause a problem seeing as in game, yellow bushes are different in mechanics than green bushes.
---
Well they first have to change the piper flair to have teeth again, then they need to add bea and max and after that they could make what you want
---
r/ihadastroke
---
Her first shot is trash and both can be easily avoided.
---
"In an alternate universe where Brawl Stars and Overwatch collab, Pam would get her first skin, that being Brigitte."
---
Fav pirate skin is carl but poco has the best animations
---
This is amazing, cya in hot
---
No problem, idk how, but at first i understand the comment normally, but after i read your reply, i read the comment again and it made no sense, so i translated it how i understand it at first
---
I know how it works and... it not good REALLY DONT WASTE YOUR TICKETS AND TIME
---
good idea
---
Oh sheet
---
I‚Äôm not jealous, I feel like my ideas were stolen
---
R/wooosh
---
Not really a nerf
---
they should bring it back, it was so cool
---
Sorry, probably should have asked before assuming.
---
Reminds me of the hunger games, but supercell doesn‚Äôt accept maps with 1 block gaps
---
I am not talking about a nerf. I want a rework of his attack. If you read my (long) comment you will see why I think it is a good thing. It‚Äôs not about Tick being OP or not, it‚Äôs about making him more engaging to use and also less toxic to face. You can be a toxic brawler and also be bad.
---
I‚Äôm not a massive Mortis player so I‚Äôll take your word for it, but in heist you always get the Dyna Barley combo, and playing Carl into them is such easy pickings, his ult can close the distance and they can‚Äôt do anything to stop you
---
I love the title
---
New event!
---
... *run for her life and mental stability *
---
Tara is damn fun, if you have her super, you can whipe out the entire enemy team, but without super she sucks, so you have to do chip damage till you charged your super and then you can kill the entire enemy team.
---
Just realized tara is now my highest brawler, not crow anymore, well need to push crow now, bye
---
woah, exellent job on the hands
---
You absolutely deserve this for the fanart

toss a coin to your witcher
---
Saw the original post of this and wondered when it would pop up again lol. I agree with this completely.
---
Yes here it is too spread out for a mid range attack, but I don‚Äôt know the actual hit box shapes and locations (hence why I am asking for them to be visible lol) and I just centered them around the mines. 
---
This gif is just to show an example of how they could draw the circles so that we see where we can walk and where we can‚Äôt. 
---
But in the linked post I explain about my idea to rework him.
---
in my old acc i pushed shelly in showdown to 700 (when band aid was op) but that acc got banned, but in my actual one my highest brawler is darryl with 650,in showdown tho
---
I have a star powered spike
---
me too, i push like 4 brawlers per season just for the star points
---
u/repostsleuthbot
---
But whenever I get 30 gems I go straight for the shop and get a big box.....
---
stunning, worth dying for
---
Whilst Me, TARA IS THE ONLY MYTICK I NEED
---
Brawlstars isn't pay to win tho?
---
if i dropped $1000 on the game right now i'd have a higher chance of winning any given game than if i didn't
---
 Nederlands?

you probably should, its an actual good idea. i know some people are put off by a wall of text but the read is worth it, trust me
---
Thats sad
---
And then you realize Snare a Bear is better in about 70% of the maps
---
Wait there‚Äôs a 600 Nita, so the others could be on the same team, but the others are Nita so no, there‚Äôs three Nita, and the winning team is all above 500, the 2 Nita‚Äôs are less than 50

This idea is perfect but the problem is Supercell will never add it no matter how good it is

There could be a way to know if there has been own scoring in the match, so Supercell wouldn‚Äôt need to watch the video

Even if they notice, they won‚Äôt reply.

To be honest I like this but the way I play tick is more agro than most players since I overestimate his star powers lol. I love using tick because I feel like hes good for control and attacking. I think it's still fun to play him because I play different probably. playing against him is a pain in the ass but I've learned to accept it and counter it because they all do the same thing.

This will happen again with Tick but in an even worse way

Well sorry geez...

Pls Supercell i never ask for anything
---
Honestly I wish we had more options with boxes. I‚Äôm sitting on a maxed account and I have like 22k gold. Sure Bea and Max have their second star powers coming but I can just buy them with gold. But I wish they‚Äôd let us like donate boxes to clan mates or friends. Something to help others out. Because honestly lol without a new brawler or something. They are pointless for me. Tho I do enjoy having an abundance of gold.

OMG that cannot be a- "quick sketch"

its amazing

I know but i still got 25 boxes from 5 20 ticket matches and i got myself bibi and bea

Im sure he/she already has all rare brawlers

I meant cursed, but i am too lazy to delay and post again.

Fist bump everyone

"UNPOPULAR OPINION INCOMING" 
---
I agree and disagree with the idea of adding a report button.
---
I agree,because some people do deserve it,especially those who violating Supercell's terms of Service (e.g. Offensive/toxic behaviour)
---
I disagree,because as I know,there are many people who hate bad randoms.So I believe if they add a report system,it would be abused.
---
P.S.:Thanks for the upcoming downvotes. :)
---
burned ! !!
---
Not pirate but ricochet
---
If you don‚Äôt like it. Then just ignore it instead of spreading toxicity
---
Italy is my country
---
Thanks
---
Sick idea, but if it were to be in game they bombs would be more clumped up (you can just barely walk through them at max range)
---
Well, in one box you got more legendaries than I did in one year playing this game. lol
---
 super into enemy base with high number of gems 
---
you may now laugh

Nice 5 tickets!

Wooosh

5 tickets omg so lucky
---
Bibi is perfect üëåüëåüëå

Maga trump 2020!

Nope. You can get 11 gems from 1 box and this is a megabox. Pretty sure you can get even more than 31.

Sorry, mistyped
---
What did you get?
---
Lol
---
I got Bea yesterday and now I have 32/32 as F2P. Not enough coins for star powers but I don't want to open boxes either. I guess I will wait until next update, but not opening boxes is boring. You don't have this feeling "what I'm gonna get" when you have all brawlers and star powers are not that exciting.
---
Best strategy 2019 well it about to end so
---
idk I‚Äôll check might repost it with the comparison
---
Ah I understand what you mean but even if we could make holes the glitch wouldn't work anymore because supercell changed the bots ai to target the safe after a while.
---
Hide on Bush is what one of the best leauge of legend players is called if im correct
---
This guy isnt bush camping he just wanted to be named after Faker (the player im talking about)
---
Irony off- Emz is bad at long range too, Emz has a small space on mid range that she does 3 tick damage, and it's fucking powerfull, most people or stay too far or too close, but there is a Gold gange that does 3 tick damage. Instead of 2 or 1.

Ah shit, here we go again

If you don't support it, why comment suggesting you do? stop trying to be smart, all your points are flawed.

In Takedown, no brawler reach Crow's level of braindead-ness tough.

---
I thougt that only noobs with 2 k can have legendarys
---
I don‚Äôt get it...
---
I‚Äôve 20k trophies after Saison reset...
---
No proof
---
0.01% chance of happening!
---
That's one in 100
---
35.Always use crow, piper and mortis in boss fight,  they are the best comp and are immune to the rockets.

Wouldn't el primo work?
---
Wtf how do you get 8
---
Dont make him more spammable
---
Team play better than in 3v3s
---
same in snake priare but snare a bear instead of circling eagle
---
cause it wil start after 6 january
---
I got 14 today and thought that was a lot lol
---
Oh she died right after this clip ended lol, I just keep staying far away from her and shoot her, she can't do anything
---
This kind of glitch wouldn't work anymore because they changed the ai of the bots.
---
Are you sure ?
---
fuck saving boxes I'll start saving them when i got everything level 9 and all brawlers
---
Yes we need to be ####freeeeee
---
Happy cake day Vel!
---
What about people like me. 65k coins and 100k star points?
---
We need something to do with too
---
Ah yes all my points are flawed, but comparing getting a brawler to hitler is a valid point. I don't support it, but it is not like you would get it right away it what I am saying. You need to "work" for it. The gold mecha skins are free in the same sense and nobody complains about getting a good looking skin for free.
---
K
---
I can't write: why?
---
I don‚Äôt think the sp glitch works anymore
---
Cro
---
Because you bored
---
Who do you like more
---
Crow
---
Very nice for them all!
---
Using angry robo as a bait
---
Sandys a dude
---
Both because I have their mecha skins
---
Oh. Finished thermochemistry recently and can't all the delta H and enthalpies out of my head! Still, best of luck for your exams!
---
Everybody gangsta till Mortis with 0 power arrives

Yep they just fill the empty places
---
Sorry,after 10 days.
---
6) Why the f@&amp;k are you supporting teaming in showdown you t&amp;@t
---
Because that doesn't ruin a key game mechanic
---
I'mma be honest, it looks like you drew a wussy on him
---
Reaction rate of a chemical reaction. 
---
Either the negative decrease in reactant concentration or increase in product concentration
---
J√≥ l√°tni itt is magyarokat
---
Captain!!!
---
The price we pay for knowing how to read, tsk tsk
---
Doesn't matter
---
Because that‚Äôs all solo showdown is, team central. It‚Äôs basically unplayable above 650 trophies.
---
wow you are very intelligent
---
Like that, will make tick better
---
Hat, of course
---
Ah yes, a man of culture
---
smol
---
First time?
---
this map be like:
---
throwers... throwers everywhere
---
200 IQ right there
---
When the Max/Bae update came I opened my saved 140 boxes and got Gene, Bae, and Max. Now I have all brawlers except for 3 legendaries.
---
‚ù§Ô∏è
---
That's a meme, idk how many cactus get chopped every minute
---
Thank you broda
---
has to be money, he has 11 brawler with under 1k trophies
---
gIVe fREe sTUFf
---
But can you tell me definition of ,,stealing" the template because i don't want this to happen again
---
Here‚Äôs to privileged children thinking that they can counter every argument with the phrase ok boomer.
---
*opponent
---
Shes one of my 2 most favorite brawlers :)
---
Thx
---
"Opinion team"
---
Won‚Äôt work with only 2 lanes to reach the safe. That is thrower heaven.
---
E
---
Dont use my meme and write over it
---
Bea doesn't need a buff
---
Its really good
---
Then don‚Äôt try to scam supercell
---
No the English used in your meme is incorrect I‚Äôm just trying to correct it i know it‚Äôs a meme
---
Thx! ;)
---
ALL HAIL LUKIE
---
21. Spin in brawl ball when your about to score even when the enemy team respawns. You‚Äôre still immune if you have the ball.
---
I‚Äôm not correcting you on the number but on your grammar
---
Coach cory : this is an amazing replay it even has good edits
---
Also coach cory: 9/10
---
Yes. Especially in robo rumble. I bet 20 tickets n got max time if I am with my reliable team. May reach about 50 boxes after 4 games
---
Mama boxes
---
Okay but why you hate it?
---
Am i the only one who can't write over it? Because i saw many people writing over it
---
Ok boomer
---
It‚Äôs not really my type of game, and it‚Äôs very unbalanced
---
Cool drawing bro
---
280
---
take my upvote and leave......
---
But thats the death animation right?
---
Then what's R?
---
Oh fuck man I‚Äôm sorry u didn‚Äôt have to say that.
---
Heck  I'm at 3500 trophies and still find it usefull
---
If u had leon u would know he needs a little buff
---
Okey okey my English grammar is not quite clear
---
Imagine using light mode
---
Isn't K the equilibrium constant
---
40.keep attacking when you have low health to increase the speed of regeneration
---
Whas that brawl box or big box??
---
Look you saying that still doesn't defend that this is low effort, so make jokes all you want
---
1 bad mach AiGht Im QuIt
---
Thx I worked hard on this
---
Its really really good
---
How many trophies do you have?
---
Not to me...
---
This is crazy teaming what happend after that
---
Np
---
Grats! It‚Äôs infinitely easier to unlock new brawlers when you own them all. Now the next grind is to max them all with both star powers :)
---
Oh ok
---
We shot each other and I somehow won
---
[R] means concentration of reactants,[P] means concentration of product :).
---
How u get from 260 power play points to 616 in 1 round??
---
Ok dumber
---
That would Kc
---
I've known about this since Emz. It's crazier with Emz
---
Its really cute
---
I got nothing yesterday and thought that was a lot lol
---
That would be Kc
---
I was talking about how the bibi was rank 1 and power 1
---
crow
---
Do you have eyes
---
U/repostsleuthbot
---
Yes I saw it that's wy I'm saying it's just one bad mach
---
Im scared
---
Imagine this creatire of the night dashing at you
---
If you do low effort shit by yourself,you cant talk about others,its hypocritic.
---
Alright this isn‚Äôt worth it goodbye friend
---
They would never let you donate boxes but gold however... I wish they let people donate gold as a lot of players are stacked with gold bars.
---
Well then it‚Äôs decided: you‚Äôre a dumb ass
---
This is awesome
---
Wonderbrad is great
---
Looks like meme material.thanks.
---
You have a samsung phone like me
---
Ok thanks for advice
---
That's a personal preference, I'm f2p too, I have 5 power 10, 3 power 9, 5 power 7 with max power poibts, aaaand 5 skins.... üòÅ
---
Memes are supposed to be funny
---
26. In brawl ball, get the ball and shoot it in your own goal. You will get quadruple trophies at the end of the game. But you have to do it twice
---
Think about it. They Spin,you Spin. The guy who spins kills you and Spin again. I think it's toxic.
---

Bruh. I screenshotted this photo for the specific reason of people accusing me of simply buying the brawlers. Sorry I didnt think there would be some fake sherlock on reddit spending minutes typing up a paragraph for god knows what reason. Do you really think that I got both leon and spike one after the other, then proceeded to make some feeble attempt at photoshopped( which I have never used in my entire life btw) to stitch them together when getting them one after the other would be almost as impressive in itself? There are literally dozens of other posts on this sub of people getting two leggies in the same box, it's not impossible. I have no idea why your so focused on me faking this shit. Can you just not believe that someone actually has luck, or something, I genuinely have no idea. Since according to you, I cant prove it to you, this whole argument is absolutely pointless.
---
Other way around would be much more useful
---
26) In siege the best strategy is to charge the enemy turret instead of collecting bolts! This is the best way to deal damage to it
---

The battery was low when he was watching the replay, not in the actual game
---
What does she say?
---
Don't spend them and add them to your actual star points from seasons
---
26) In siege always charge the enemy turret! This is way easier to deal damage them collecting bolts
---
Because?
---
Aww thanks for the compliment!! Very encouraging
---
I have 14 brawlers to upgrade and 63 coins rn. We need more coins, not more ways to spend them
---
Negative stonks
---
Your welcome. Also if you meet another person like this which they say it is there meme template check there account for proof because some people lie like he did. In this case he used the meme from another person then start stealing credit for it.
---
GG man
---
What is this? A crossover episode?
---
Well no, at ~700 people start to learn how the game works, so if they are on 1200 they NEED to know how the game works to be that high. If you played the game, you know that under 700 trophies, most people are bad and don‚Äòt know how the game works, but at around 700 trophies, people start to understand how the game works, so that‚Äòs just a fact
---
what if he makes some sort of pattern? this time wearing orange to match the first image
---
I'm sandy rn
---
Funny becuz night witch mortis = bad
---
Sorry to break it to you but someone has already did this
---
I know the feeling (I have 29 brawlers, 5 power 10, 3 power 9, and ALL the others are ready to be upgraded one or two or three levels)  but as i said in my first comment:
---
Exactly! Why in the fuck would I get both spike and leon one after the other, then continue to photoshop them together, when getting them one after the other is just as impressive. That's literally what that dude is saying. I have no words lmao.
---
She's just a 3v3 brawler. They shouldn't change that. Therefore she is better in the 3v3 game modes.
---
lEyEnDaRy
---
"But at around 700 trophies, people start to understand how the game works, so that's just a fact". That isn't a fact bro, that is something YOU think.
---
cause he black
---
thank you
---
this can be used for: being short of 5 few star point to buy a skin or box, get rid of ones (I have 209, what am I supposed to do with 9?), or get rid of piling coins... Having more star points will help get new skins when released
---
Delete this
---
Yde hold my shovel
---
Hahahaha
---
Spike is Illuminati
---
26. If you‚Äôre playing Doubles Showdown and you are a Poco. Don‚Äôt worry, you‚Äôll heal more health if your Super is not hitting anyone else!
---
Oh yes? What About Bo and Crow! They have 2 recolor skins!...
---
I did that i already got to maximum tropies
---
Cursed rosa
---
Good post, although the last one is actual good advice.
---
I bought it!
---
Thank you everyone I always did the contrary.
---
Now I'm the first one on the leaderboard.
---
As a Pok√©mon fan I live the chlorophyll idea
---
Nah. My profile is JCUGJ2LO
---
That's a good one!!!
---
Bo
---
U are not just wrong u are stupid
---
it's the man himself
---
Holy shit he did the math
---
27. If you are carrying 10 gems in gem grab, run to the other team‚Äôs side. The gems will give you a shield
---
You can trow the ball in the corners
---
I love how Bibi has to give herself a hi 5 .
---
Nope they all have the same chance.if you have 0.1 chance at legendary you have 0.1 chance to get a legendary in any box
---
37: when you rush mid on cavern churn as mortis, you will instantly gain 200 free trophies!
---
He looks depressed lul
---
22. Go into the green gas in Showdown. It lets the game know you want healing mushrooms.
---
I have never given an award on reddit, but the effort in this post and the post itself are amazing! So here is reddit silver for you!
---
THIS IS EPIKƒ∂K
---
Good to hear that you can take a joke :)
---
38: Like + subscibe =a free legendary brawler.
---
1. when playing colt shoot his bullets on walls to make them bounce
---
Is it bad that I got to number 9 before realizing something was wrong
---
You guys... don't forget, best way to gain trophies is through the *secret* dungeon with a big boss and lots of mobs.
---
Please, stop sending such ideas.
---
They will not be realized and you make a mockery of yourself. 
---
Supercell must respect copyright. 
---
Send brawler concepts that are your ideas.
---
Just be creative!
---
Poco's super is so good in close range, use it near to brawlers
---
Sad thing is some of those are good tips
---
lmaoo
---
HAHAHAHAHAHA
---
If it is teaming, get a baseball bat and a bowling ball and crush it.
---
mabye i have a chance to get an lengerdary now
---
Really amazing idea but probably a green hook instead of a hand would do
---
Thanks!
---
I need this map back
---
They were in same lobby
---
I JUST FOUND OUT IF YOU SEE A GREEN GAS GO INTO IT BECAUSE IT WILL NOT HARM YOU
---
*special gas*
---
Good Idea‚ô°
---
So a 9 yo kid died to a leon and got raged so hard. And then, this meme got created.
---
Oh ein nicht fremdsprachiger ich bin verbl√ºfft!
---
Sick of it
---
They had us in the middle of the video not gonna lie
---
He did nothing the whole game and almost lost it
---
Heck
---
I rather say skin trade not brawler
---
This is **FANTASTIC!** This post deserves way more than 200 upvotes! With THIS amount of effort, this needs at least 4k upvotes! If I had enough coins, I would give you a platinum reward!
---
I think it's 9 gemsüòé|Quick maths|üòÇ
---
This is great
---
Well, f**k me but how did that happen?
---
Ok I agree
---
I don't think so
---
Duh it's obviously braille on the screen
---
I dont even care about the finals, only thing I care about is the star tokens.
---
I think it's 9 gems or 4x5 gemsüòÇüòé
---
I think there should be a club box. Once a month you all work together to get at most 10,000 trophies. The reward goes up each box you open so if your entire clan only gets let‚Äôs say 5,000 it would be equivalent to like 3 mega boxes. If you already have everybody and their star powers it has a chance do drop skins you can only get from that!
---
Like me...
---
TOTALLY UNPLAYABLE
---
I don't do drawings like this very often. This is actually my first big drawing. It took a while to make.
---
Me with 15k trophies and without legendaries : ohhh, my son, you dont know all life
---
Different map. Bozo, u didn‚Äôt notice the different names
---
≈ûi eu sunt din Rom√¢nia hh-
---
This is sucks.
---
I used the star power glitch in friendly games.
---
It also makes you one shot the heist safe. And like 2 shot the takedown robot
---
Nice, I really enjoyed buried angel. Currently on nowise but the boss is hella annoying lol
---
*Smokeeeh*
---
Good question
---
**laughs in Shelly**

No. It‚Äôs because you are a DIRTY TEAMER

Atm rico is old

What if your maxed out on points
---
I have 18 to upgrade  and all of them are lvl 6-8.
---
It is

Well,at 9.1k I have 23 brawlers
---
In Soviet Russia, Plants uses you
---
Bruh u want free karma
---
You should try kayn, Rhaast is op asf
---
tbf that does work with medical use barley
---
And cause of that too
---
33. In brawl ball, if you get the ball and you are close to your goal just camp with it in your own goal so the other team can‚Äôt get the ball.
---
Nice starpoint skin
---
Hat all the way
---
It only has that bottom part because it was a meme template he got from that person. If he wanted to steal it he would of cropped it out and got rid of the watermark.
---
Yeah, siege need more maps and the map is amazing!
---
Keep that fucking shit on r/coachcorysubmissions
---
Is it free modeling for 3 weeks? Wtf dude
---
Ok but why do u have a low trophy account
---
I like getting rick rolled
---
46. Always auto-aim with piper, Brock, colt, 8-bit, and other snipers. You will never miss a shot.
---
46. Go AFK as soon as you connect to a game.
---
46. When playing a brawler with a spawnable, such as Jessie, Pennie, Pam, etc., throw the spawnable at the green clouds in showdown! This will give the spawnable more health.
---
Wow wow, a kid wants karma
---
And why we didnt just rub it, sorry for mistrounding
---
this ^^
---
Someone that is lagging?
---
am I OG if I knew and watched the game since the beta release and started playing on global
---
To keep it rare
---
ye buried angel is fun
---
I honestly don't think I'll beat doom gauntlet cause I'm on mobile and I heard the nowise boss lags a lot on mobile
---
I am special
---
This is myhtic
---
After that I'm teaming with opponents because it's lost match
---
I know that you counter me but stop being so rude Mortis :(
---
Weird ok but flex
---
I dont counter you, you counter me
---
My favorita is the gene skin
---
This reminds me of a Phoenix Wright scene √∂
---
Lmao, I'm here that lost 2k trophies because of season reset and don't need help :p
---
And im not rude
---
Porque a rico?
---
Throughout the game he would be standing still for long periods of time. If I weren't able to move I would close the app and turn into a bot rather than be useless
---
Depends on the map lo
---
*trickSHIT
---
It‚Äôs the simble of speed up it happens every time a brawler speeds up
---
Oh god not this again.
---
It was funny once now go on something else
---
Well yeah ,but did you know Mortis is the worst  brawler?
---
What are the 3 brawlers?
---
Wait... But if literally every single player says this it pretty much means that also randoms are bad, but you are bad too?
---
There is nothing to decipher, you're just overthinking this a little bit
---
MORTIS IS AMAZING OWO
---
what
---
u/VredditDownloader
---
Its buged
---
True this is to true and then they say My RaNdOmS aRe So BaD iTs tOatLy Not Me
---
I know I‚Äôm ashamed of myself üò§
---
I never saw it on the subreddit, I was walking after leaving my gf at home and it popped in my mind lol
---
I know. If you want to know why its because he cant counter heavy weights or sometimes even fighters
---
Hell√≥
---
Bea is really fun in SD though when you shred through other people
---
We are all trash
---
47. When you are in showdown with 1 enemy left leave the game and join it after a while. the enemy will die from gas and you will not  because you will be not registered in game and you will win
---
And Rey (youtuber) made a tierlist about the worsts brawlers 2 days ago
---
But still it's just a screenshot
---
AShe looks perfectly fin to me
---
Bibi is my favorite brawler. Art 10/10
---
Yes with her second star power
---
Time to take care of the weeds!
---
doesn't matter it's unique according the bot you summoned gg nub
---
Darryl can't speak, small pee-pee
---
lol u edited your comment
---
;)) thankss
---
r/shittybrawlstars
---
So when there is a new update you have a lot of boxes to open to the the brawler
---
Max is okay with her speed 
---
But just damage buff
---
so it was just a shaved cavern churn all that time...
---
Nice dude for trying outüòâ
---
There was an offer that made him 59 gems
---
I would rather have spike for free
---
This is old, you didn't make it...
---
Clothes , are missing
---
50. Stand on the little red circles to summon a giant robot minion that will assist you in battle.
---
Nice fact, and also, every brawler with speed boost gets upvotes, and every brawler with slow effects (emz's super, shelly's shell shock, and spike's super for example) gets downvoted.
---
alright
---
That‚Äôs cool thanks
---
Credit to my friend Zain as well as myself.
---
An alolan max
---
I made it. Please stop talking shit
---
Mortis Doesn't Takes even Long Too Open Boxes, and Atleast Poco Haves 3 ammos and I Think He Isn't That Slow
---
Reginald
---
The bot doesn‚Äôt recognise even a little bit of editing. Congratulations. Because ur being a d*ck i‚Äôm gonna downvote all ur posts. F*ck you!
---
"How do you do fellow humans"
---
Then show me you made since right above your post is a older meme using this tamplate
---
#*OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO-
---
Carl: Oh no! Brock has shot me in my eye! You don‚Äôt want to mess with my friend Brock...
---
Brock: Ahahah, you‚Äôre friend is probably really small just like you!
---
Colt (Carl‚Äôs friend): Are you sure about that?
---
Correct, and if you get got by crows extra toxic star power you get blue down arrows, very similar to the downvote icon
---
This poor man had a stroke, unless we all fell for an r/woosh
---
tick, 8 bit, emz : am i a joke to you?
---
He did goals to the own goal ;-;
---
Yeah, ya know. Troll people.
---
i have 14400 and still without them
---
hAHa I hAvE 69 sKIN GeM HahA oN sHoP hAhA
---
The better question is where do the bad randoms come from? Instagram memes?
---
(Please tell me if I'm making myself clear with this joke)
---
I‚Äôve only done colt Shelly and poco but I‚Äôll keep making more.
---
I actually kinda like it , this map is challenging and I won 2 games with no power cubes xD . ( I beat an El primo with 5 power cubes and I was playing as Nita . )   
---
It's not a bad map tho :v . ( I am a tryhard too ) .
---
Oh.
---
I feel the pain.
---
there is pink piper and piper calavera
---
Actually using dynajump is funny
---
True
---
Wow, Capture the Flag in 5v5 mode would be really sick!
---
I sent the friend request
---
It fuckin ruined snake praire
---
Sure, you never really play with people you add after a couple of good games. What i did was join a local club and make connections. Ofcourse if you‚Äôre bad at the game, that won‚Äôt help you. Supercell has given us enough options to not play with randoms, it‚Äôs your choice to do so.
---
What can I say except delete this
---
:0
---
Yeah I know right!
---
Ty
---
I have never been so offended of something that i 
---
One hundred percent agree with
---
Yeah and do you wanna find out why ?   
---
Because even his cart is bored of his talking .....
---
15200 and no legendary
---
Currently there are none
---
Bruh why did people down vote there is something called sarcasm
---
Probably because the new one is too shiny. The old one was clean.
---
SMOKEYYYYYY !
---
That‚Äôs because that Shelly was back stabbing your team
---
Grooky and bibi could go well
---
This is a lot better ! you got my vote dude .
---
Stfu you toxic jerk
---
Just saying it to be cool :&lt;.
---
but enemy team steal a gift, then they stay in their base so your team has no chances to steal their gift, then you lose
---
Nice how many trophies
