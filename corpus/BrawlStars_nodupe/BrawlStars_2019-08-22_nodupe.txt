Anyone else think Spike looks funny from behind?
---
---
---
Lol
---
Who are you?
---
Well, there is a brawl stars rule 34 sub, and now i think they'll get combinations of rule 34 and 63
---

---
For those wondering what sub i mean r/brawlstarsp (look at your own risk)
---
Yes,yes he is.
---
I meant that OP's idea would be useless because that screen is skipped a lot of the time for some people, I didn't say "Supercell fix this."
---
I didnt even know u guys had ur supers all at once, i just gave up because i knew were were not gonna winüòî
---
Cursed video
---
Cause you can actually see upwards
---
Were you playing with other people or was the 3 legendaries a coincidence?
---
Maybe your freand Is Pay2Win

Darryl: Rolling endlessly on the edges
---
No, i was playing with my friends. Was the triple jump a coincidence?
---
I reported him
---
It isn‚Äôt bad. I fact it‚Äôs bettter than first. Can u think before u post. It isn‚Äôt funny. Crow is my favourite brawler and I would say that it‚Äôs starpowers are equally good if ur a pro and u can notice how strong it could be.
---
Spread out spawns shelly can just run your way then you wouldn't notice first then too late also WAY TO MUCH CACTUS
---
Mortis, Crow, and Frank
---
How would you know?
---
she T H I C C
---
Nope, it does nothing.
---
BRUH FLEXES SHIBA NITA
---
I will change the spawns but I‚Äôm keeping all the cactus
---
You're not very good at giving advice.
---
Halloween brawler...? Both mortis and frank are purple-ish and they both woulf fit a "scary" theme.
---
So it's just for show? Does it show on your profile how many awards you have won?
---
the blending colors are insane. best art ive seen in a while
---
No I was with my friends too. I was playing piper and I said the win is only a win if I‚Äôm in the air at the end. Then we had the idea of having all of us in the air at the end, and there were three brawlers that we have that can jump.
---
Hmm
---
This happened to me once. There was this bo in brawl ball who was in my team and when i passed the ball to him he just spinned and scored our own goal 2 times. This is a BIG issue in brawl ball and i hope supercell fixes it.
---
There is no other way that is possible as a Free2play
---
Yea, it should be :

Did you really downvote me for explaining lol...  
---
It‚Äôs a game man, some people just play for fun, not to be super try hard. But honestly I do both, there‚Äôs times where I‚Äôll do this. And times where I just take every opportunity I get, mostly a spur of the moment thing or mood thing. Or your attitude towards that opponent, did they steal your box and harass you, kill em. Where they a respectable opponent that benefitted you during the match, maybe give them a fighting chance.
---
holy--- i remember it took me FORVER to beat this game cause i suck as console games. I loved it though.
---
I have all the brawlers. Opened boxes for star powers.
---
What? Do you want this clip in a video? Or...
---
Lol ok :)
---
Those are duo spawns

RobTop will only launch 2.2 when the Sun explodes

sorry i had to ruin the 69 comment here is 70
---
That‚Äôs pretty normal for a 3.7k
---
When i was at 5k, I didn‚Äôt even have all the super rares lol
---
But I got Spike at 5.4k
---
100% calculated
---
Why in brawlstarsp
---
well i'm grinding more than i thought was humanly possible so hopefully it won't be long till i get someone higher. Just sucks that it's been so long since unlocking anyone
---
It was a normal box, I don‚Äôt if any patch affected box rolls, but, it was a normal box. The photo is from May 24th.
---
Could‚Äôve just cut out 30 seconds
---
But nice play
---
A good timing Nita could make her bear fly too.
---
Purple like Potato chips
---
There is no way you can get 2 brawlers from 1 box
---
Big boxes makes sense because they have 3 boxes in them, but you just can‚Äôt get 2 brawlers from 1 small box
---
I have a Weene
---
The only thing I cannot forget is the fact that there are always shotgunners everywhere
---
Not the fact that Piper has more hp than El Primo
---
Weird flex but ok
---
I‚Äôve met a power 10 Pam at 40 trophies lol
---
Big oof
---
Yes,but if they put that in the game It would be something like 1 gem.
---
What about Taraferb
---
Also tnx for the enemy team for the good pass
---
But it looks cool tho
---
OwO
---
EEeeEEeeEEeeEEeel PRIMooOOooOOooOO
---
Go to the shop, click on the mega box or big box, then click on the ‚Äúi‚Äù on the top left when it asks you if you want to buy it
---
Purple..!
---
I doubt it
---
You can‚Äôt get a legendary chance of 4.00
---
Mine is 0.0984
---
Now 0.0436
---
coding doesnt work like that, changing 1 think can lead to a mess of others. ever wonder why when a game updates theres usually bugs that come after, that's the reason
---
YES YES YES YES YES
---
Nice job beating one of the best playerd
---
This is aesthetic
---
Let‚Äôs get this guy some upvotes
---
This has been known/out for a long time now
---
Grats, man! You're even 300 trophies ahead of the top second Bibi player in the world.
---
Since this is the top comment I will give the portal to the original home of this creation &gt; r/DarrylGang
---
bad advertising
---
So, if I'm hearing you correctly...it's Colt with Demolition?

I haven't gotten a star power in a month, today I finally did, it was genes new SP üò≠

Shameless plug https://discord.gg/xNrP45S

Weird how the boxes only pop in after the match is over guessing most actors just pop away when off screen which I weird because I feel like most phones could handle all actors loaded at once
---
Stop we'll probably get banned for this and that will be all your fault
---
Sorry to tell you this but.

---
Lose 6 times in a row in duo showdown because of shit teammates
---
Yeah I lean towards creating a level playing field from the get go if it‚Äôs designed for esports as well but I‚Äôm guessing that they were also worried about survival back then as the game nearly didn‚Äôt make it out of beta iirc.
---
I think if brawl stars becomes popular as an e sports and the player base grows they might be able to transition to skins only model a la fortnite, and maybe star points can be converted into other resources or something as you suggested; they‚Äôre good suggestions by the way. So let‚Äôs hope their current push brings the game to more new users so they do a more competitive model
---
I got my first epic at 4.5k.
---
Crow: I'm a joke for you?
---
what can i have a silver
---
I don't even know what his second SP is but the first one can ruin a lot of gem grab and bounty games. I'm not saying it's the best out there but it's made me laugh, its made me want to throw my phone.
---
Check again
---
No yoi can't handle that power. I don't know where did you find that N-WORD pass?
---
I will find a use for these one day...
---
Hey lowme, do you plan to do this for all the brawlers and include a 360 spin for each? If so, that would be amazing!
---
Videoleap on IOS only I think
---
Brock, Mortis, Nita, Leon and a whole bunch of others were different before (Mortis, Nita and Leon looked super ugly back in beta).
---
Randoms this is why you don‚Äôt auto-aim
---
Snappy sniping works.
---
Yeah I hate it when ppl do that when they‚Äôre obviously not safe yet and I just had a teammate do that just the other day... Best of all the countdown had stopped cos another teammate got hosed and he was. still. spinning. No surprises here, he got wrecked.
---
*than
---
Instead of getting 1st or 2nd place in solo and winning in duos it should be like star tokens (top 4 in solos and top 2 teams in duos)
---
Why tf would u repost it then
---
because the initial post didn‚Äôt get enough attention
---
Rico and Mortis
---
Would be nice to have a ‚ÄúReport‚Äù flair where we may post videos on toxic player ruining our games.

Oh yup lemme just ignore the comments section exists

Lol wanna do barley next? Extra cute plz!(lol get it cause I‚Äôm ordering it like you did with your pizzaü§£ü§£
---
It actually is though. Unless you are *tragically* inept or rely excessively on your teammates, the disparity between power levels is a comparatively small factor. I‚Äôd argue pushing with lower-leveled brawlers is easier than ever.
---
For example, I‚Äôm currently at around 13.9K trophies and I only have one star power (Energize), as well as five other SPs yet to be obtained from boxes. All of my other brawlers are at levels 4-8.
---
TL;DR: Skill&gt;Power the vast majority of the time.
---
(Join club copy dat darryl) we got bull bibi rosa  and THICC CARL
---
Then why stop at 2k?
---
How do you check?
---
I hope there are less memes and more original content. More rewards for good posts :)

Lol imagine how cool it would be if you did all robots! BUT ERH MAH GERD THAT IS SOOO cool!!! People like you inspire others to make amazing stuff like this keep up the hard work

New show coming to theater wow (movie business) we are making money showing 30 minute shows a week

So many questions.

First, Same as bad????

And why are the two cars going the same direction in the first panel, but then going in opposite directions in the other panels?
---
not sure
---
I have this exact board
---
I‚Äôm not saying bandaid Shelly isn‚Äôt op, but tick does not suck lmfao, he‚Äôs insanely strong
---
No, ultra noob. i have 689 solo wins all with leon.  Sorry you probably have more. Wins with 3 vs 3..
---
If I‚Äôm basing this strictly off of personal data, then my guess would be 6000-9000. The people that I am matched with usually fall within this range (much to my chagrin).
---
Nevermind I found it but why does it have a rare brawler chance even though I have unlocked all the rare brawlers?
---
This is really nice but I think that it would look even better without the thick line outlining on the right
---
For me it is
---
Also
---
Good teammates (desert)
---
Bad randoms (city)
---
He's not underpowered, he's underwhelming.
---
Wow i need tips i cant get 100 nita mines STUCK AT 500 (bruh maybe you should help the noobs
---
That's a horrible idea showing the star power takes the fun of the surprise factor
---
and the theme thing it's just it's stupid 
---
supercell is keep brawl stars really simple and this stuff makes it stupid
---
**B a N d _ A i**
---
Guess what? You wasted all your Legendary luck in that SD game.
---
I though u would do something like pull the spike with Tara‚Äôs super
---
I hate seeing primo bull colt Jessie nita bo etc
---
I feel you, man. I have this problem too :/

Wait that‚Äôs illegal

Because its not as braindead OP as band aid

Honestly, I Don't Understand Why Everyone Hates Fortnite, Sure, Its In A Bad State *cough cough* Pacific rim robots that are like titans *cough cough* But it aint Dying, Wait What Was That Game again?? Pobg? Pabg? OHHHH Pubg, Does Anyone Even Still Remember It? But I'm getting Off Topic
---
My Point Is That Fortnite IS Losing Players But It Ain't Dying, And Even If It Is, EVER. SINGLE. PERSON. Has Been Saying Fortnite Is Dying Since S7, But S7 Was The Peak Of Players, So Was It Reaaaaaalllyyyy Dying??? 
---
(Btw don't downvote just because you disagree with me plz, I'm staying Mah opinion)

Well, you can only have so many dragon heads.

You can‚Äôt control that cause you out of the game already sadly ‚òπÔ∏è

Tremendo. Rodemos

It's unfair, cause you can see someone hiding in a bush for example

Oh sorry I was doing a pathetic comment about me trying to be funny but since that was the question you originally answered it is a show called Stranger Things and on Netflix which is a SiFi horror show with an 80‚Äôs kick to it and it is scary at times then it‚Äôs funny then romantic then dramatic it‚Äôs all you could ever asked for about modern times poking at old times but it is a good show and it has three seasons so yeah well uh... does that answer your question
---
Only 5 times?

Nice Idea, But:

I'd prefer Green for common,

Keep Light Blue for Trophy Road,

Yes Caz I have the band aid

Not with bandaid.

Where did i see this...
---
Oh lwarb beta!
---
Yea that‚Äôs what I meant
---
Leon and Crow are good in Showdown but aren't played a lot in other modes Spike is versatile and can be played as a control brawler in many modes and Curveball just makes him better
---
You fucking killed him dude
---
Ok so i don‚Äôt understand this comment. Would anyone mind helping me
---
This is true, but it‚Äôs justified. Not only the community wants remodels, but so do the Devs. It‚Äôs not a priority, but some models are definitely worse than others **COUGH EL PRIMO COUGH**

This idea sucks, copied from sylas of league of legends
---
That Shelly deserved to lose AND get her phone smashed
---
*Me crying without bibi. Spike and leon while all of my brawlers are above 500*
---
Mortis has the most balanced range for basic movement attacks. When it was longer it was op.
---
Tbh same with crow and tick
---
Clever

No worries

Too bad there's on skin where Carl is on a horse

You should be happy atleast you have a legendary
---
How? Counters like mortis now 4 shot you instead of shotting you
---
thanks!
---
There should be small bushes where heavyweights can't hide
---
Based on what Frank said it kinda looks that way. Maybe he‚Äôs pulling a fast one though since he knows the expectation he set last time by saying green for Rosa.
---
It's star power tier list,not a brawler one
---
WhatüòÇ
---
Yes
---
Yeah but its suddenly so amazing
---
If I have to be completely honest I didn‚Äôt even know it changed, I don‚Äôt spend too much time on the main menu lol.
---
Right, I'm a just try it. 
---
CREEPER
---
Not me I hate old siege ;)
---
I noticed it today LOL
---
I knoow and the old music
---
I meant Brawl Stars is back in business but it‚Äôs kinda odd so I changed it a bit
---
They also changed the music?(Sorry for my english i‚Äôm italian)
---
I haven't played for a while so same thing
---
I have 15,7k trophies... NO LEGENDARY üò≠
---
Lol love the dancing while surrounded by chaos.
---
Nice repost.
---
I guess we're back in mid 2018
---
Power level doesn‚Äôt dictate matchmaking. Only trophies.
---
It still deals damage if you are close enought when it is destroyed. The jump allows me to avoid that damage
---
I'm gonna be really upset if it's an epic because i just need the legendaries and if i get an epic instead my legendary chance will be low af
---
I was jamming to it at first, but it got  annoying very quickly
---
Retropolis event was the best imo
---
Or you can just shoot it while it's further away now go drink milk and grow up
---
I will too, I‚Äôve been save boxes since Bibi because I thought the next would be legendary. I have close to 650...
---
Any
---
It feels boring now #brawl stars in a nutshell
---
U didn't use the star power...u just destroyed the head...u do enough damage to destroy ticks head...u just destroyed it before it hit u...
---
As a pwr 10 spike i always wanted to blend w my bois
---
It was the original menu theme
---
Me too
---
You could make something with the clubs and add a new game mode for more players different to showdown for example take the flag or something like this with bigger maps
---
Honestly im glad its back, the last one got stale and annoying very quickly
---
Same
---
Does anyone know why the bar at the top is black? Shouldn't the background be stretched a little bit so it matches the actual background. So annoying.
---
I agree with u AmixTV_YT
---
tick does not understand the concept of gender
---
only bombs
---
Wait that's illegal
---
I did the same thing with my iPad when the game was in portrait, I turned it into landscape

I have an explanation. The ball goes through anything to close to it when somebody releases it. For instance if you have the ball(try in bots) and you are directly against the wall and kick it against it it will bounce from and go through you.

Looks sick!

It feels calm tbh. I wish they could do different music, based on the brawler we select. Like if i choose darryl, it would play some pirate theme or something. That would be good.

well, the first mortis claims to be a noob, and the second is using night btch mortis

---
Hi
---
Hi fellow nova eagle clanmate
---
1 more mythic needed to balance out i guess
---
Yea, it's not like it's harder, it's just that you lose some trophies after the season reset, so not that much players play enough to get their old 500 brawlers to 700, like i had all my brawlers at 500 befor the trophy rework, but i now just have 4 on 700, cause i don't play much, so i get one to 700, cause it's easy to get to 700, then i play with the next and get to him to 700 and then comes the season reset and i have to get them to 700 again

We are not toxic these posts are horrible and 6-12 year olds see alot people making these bad posts and overuse them.And that's why everyone hates these except for the people who make these.Look,I am not trying to be mean but please don't post these bad posts
---
And when is that

Whens the update
---
That's a lot.
---
I think the only background colour they haven't done is a legendary one. I'd love to see that but this is pretty good too.
---
Is this Brawl Stars?
---
Can u do a tutorial on this n how n what not
---
Ehre
---
I mean this games not really ‚Äúp2w‚Äù just because you can spend some money dosent mean your going to be ‚Äúgood‚Äù or even make you ‚Äúbetter‚Äù at the game üòÇ iv spent maybe 20 bucks over the last 3 or 4 months
---
Gotta love that "To be continued" addition
---
Waiting for part 2!!
---
Liebe
---
We'll probably find out next week. I expect we a brawl talk coming next wednesday
---
Near 0.3 but they gave me gene.. dam
---
i bought this over the loaded rico one cuz loaded is overrated ps: yes i am f2p
---
326 trophies and spending money already? That‚Äôs my man!
---
Also, shiva Nita is the only skin in the game worth it to buy
---
Swirly Roads?
---
So why you all saying he ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
"and them" good spelling error
---
Blet are russian fans of one of the youtubers. They are little boys 10-14 years old therefore stupid and bad players.

After championship i hope.
---
Yep
---
Ik
---
juu p√§iv√§√§
---
Its just add to game i think in next update maybe SC add something maybe new box to star shop or
---
Haha nice one
---
Gene was OP he could crash the game with his super
---
Looks good but ...the nose
---
...what?
---
Sorry dude, that's all I know.
---
Not yet
---
is he being sarcastic? that‚Äôs not how you say incredible in spanish.
---
oWo
---
No problem mate.
---
For me supercell has robbed him totally
---
fake
---
dyna's jump &gt; demolition
---
It's fuckin annoying
---
While im here with a bunch of coins not getting any star powers in the shop
---
unc0ver or chimera?
---
Impossible
---
When you see a player named "pro"
---
No she didn't, she kept running straight and dying the whole game
---
so it‚Äôs both, right?
---
We don't do that here
---
I want my Mecha music back
---
In my experiences(note I rarely use Pam) every Pam I've seen has rarely gotten the best out of Shelly
---
can‚Äôt tell if he was joking or not.
---
Statistically SP should come with one out of every 100 boxes. Should.
---
I also noticed it today
---
Ohhhhhhh... oh dear lord two troll teammates!?
---
Most shellies are super agro, but I find I can keep them at bay with pam's modest dps. It really adds up over time
---
[–ë–õ–≠–¢]
---
Very nice
---
thats a nice idea.
---
Gene was OP upon release, he made the entire game crash
---
Bear with me. I think Hyper Bear is Better just in heist
---
Wow Such a cool style
---
people would think im a gemmer and wouldnt be suprised. and those gems actually took months of savings and im pretty proud of myself considering i mostly got 3 or 5 on boxes
---
Cleannn
---
Thank you :)
---
And have a great day.
---
I mean if it‚Äôs something other than legendary like an epic or lower.
---
I missed this
---
No u
---
He‚Äôs getting sandwiched
---
Yeah! GX like –ë–õ–≠–¢ but italian
---
r/comedycemetery
---
i just lost  60 trophies playing with randoms on gem grab, what a great way to start my day.
---
Repost
---
I mean what‚Äôs wrong with being a ‚Äúgemmer‚Äù. They sustain the game so ftp players can keep playing.
---
Ohhhh
---
Not bad at all and yes that‚Äôs true
---
And suck at math, wasnt the skin 300?
---
He is tho.. He wore a bikini in a supercell vid
---
SANS BEAR SANS BEAR
---
+, -
---
No it's not, 30 gems for 10 star tokens, umm no
---
It makes me feel better.
---
Looks like you spent all of 10 mins on it
---
I think its the clan
---
Very good new
---
Troppo raro trovare italiani ahahah
---
If this subreddit has shown us anything, its that most people who play shelly/primo often are toxic braindead muppets.
---
Puedes buscar videos que ense√±en en youtube
---
Wtf is this lmao
---
I miss the robo music üò≠üò≠üò≠
---
Agreed, but Lunar Year was legendary
---
Good job you bring back your healt and more talent, There is a Gene Pajama skin back It is very nice do it
---
I was so happy this morning when i saw the blue background.I was getting tired of the *Summer of  Robots* background and music.
---
Nice Cral skin (not sarcasm)
---
*7980 can
---
Welcome back!
---
Finally a decent post in this sub reddit
---
What about SF
---
I have no idea what the previous background even was.
---
That'd be super sweet. Really I'd take anything that makes some interesting change, rather than just buffing something.
---
Even his original SP could be cool if it was buffed, I like the idea of nerfing opponents but I think in practice 10% is just barely noticeable.
---
His gender is a attack helicopter
---
Nobody brings shelly to siege.. take bo, jessie, penny, idk who but not shelly...
---
See you in hot
---
Streak of 1?
---
You clearly have mental issues
---
Skin for Leon too, maybe? :P
---
Sounds weird for a star power, but actually a good idea! üòÄ
---
Ticks gender is üóøüóøüóøüóøüóø
---
Why the fuck did you post this 6 times
---
I kinda hated it after a while
---
Powercube, Powercube is Powercubes gender.
---
[this is an example](https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/cty0c5/is_good/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app), the guy posted this 6 times in a row
---
*insert rico singing BRAWL STARS, BRAWL STARS*
---
Jerk Shelly walks up to you
---
Nice skin man, keep up the good work
---
What game mode
---
The "surprise" Factor adds RNG into the game.
---
Honestly though...
---
I watched this several times on purpose just to be the 69 view, so nice
---
If the legendary chance is more than mythic then it's high
---
¬øTe has basado √©se brawler de la pel√≠cula "salvar al soldado Ryan"?
---
This is just underrated
---
It MUST shoot molar arrows
---
Thanks a lot!
---
It sas add today
---
You think this would be a unfair advantage, but it's not because literally every single player is in a bush.
---
Whether Leon is invisible or not Penny can still track him down with her turret at any time. 
---
Especially, when he is still and invisible at the same time.
---
Pipers remodel
---
WHY DID THIS GET OVER 2 UPVOTES? THIS IS LITERALLY A SHITPOST
---
Yeah no one really cares what skin you buy with gems that you bought or earned in the game. You should probably just keep to your sled and only post in this subreddit if it adds to the community.
---
I prefer loaded rico, but popcorn rico is still a great skin
---
I hate this meme format
---
Don‚Äôt forget pro, YT and TTV
---
Exactly. But he just said I‚Äôm the one with mental issues. About the only worse choice is piper. But now with snappy sniping, she‚Äôs actually very viable.
---
I mean they can both go around walls so they are basically the same brawler
---
mortis gang does not approve
---
Why not?
---
Brawl stars has always been a completely ad-free company, they get all their revenue off their players. That's your own fault bruh
---
What about Dinamike with his boys with their supers behind a wall
---
Im just glad that they are going to change the music periodically it is nice when a game does that.
---
Im glad that you‚Äôre back and healthy :D
---
Guys Why So Many Downvotes ?
---
Because some people are dicks
---
Or dutch
---
Where's the credit for the person who made it.
---
What if you open the random box with 0 powercube got power cube removed? will there be negative power cubes?
---
what ? No, reason she was op was because her super neglected %80 damage for so long she would tank everything, attack you and get her super back all while still having her super activated. It had nothing to do with everyone playing her.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Also a level 5 rosa has 6000 health. A level 10 colt would be hitting her for (provided every single bullet hits) 2016 damage. Not every bullet will hit.
---
Exatly
---
That‚Äôs a cool Bike
---
Didn‚Äôt it only crash your game?
---
Her super was so long back then and the charge was so short. You could go the entire game with a shield sometimes
---
Guys I‚Äôm sha.... nah not worth the pasta
---
Way too op
---
I like it more than the other one
---
Legend says that carl never play again since then
---
I feel you
---
I bet he does this every week with a new clan haha
---
I mean sapient robots kind of literally are non-binary
---
Nice but you forgot to add the power cube boxes:(
---
Read the red text
---
I was grinding but I forgot what it was before
---
Is it just me or has it always been [blue?](https://imgur.com/a/r5BTS6L) Granted the only thing that changed was my name for streaming purposes
---
Only downside is he's no longer in the clan to give him kudos. Lol.
---
Christ that's Jason Born
---
I have commented enough on this topic and I do not want to discuss it further because you do not seem to see the impact of this idea in the game. Besides of that, nobody in the comments agrees with you. This idea just sucks.
---
If you didn't think it was funny, I'm sorry to hear.
---
Watch this guy named PewDiePie, he's really funny. Subscribe to him too.

Hmmm... Ok

Hm? Almost 100% upvotes now

Everything about this post is perfect

200 might be a little expansive, how about 150?

As It Seems To Me

I'll own up to that White Crow needs some representation
---
i have exactly 69 gems for popcorn rico but i already have loaded and i just wanna save up for other things oof

Yea

What happened to you? Why did you have to recover for a month?

Sorry for hijacking the top comment. Can someone explain the joke to me? I'm not a native english speaker and I don't get it.
---
Nice yoz leaked out leon skin
---
Nice ;)
---
Because he continued the poem with the leaving message. And club rhymes with shrub.
---
That's hard on you bro go and cash
---
First kinda liked the robo music but I didn't want to listen to it anymore soo I wanted the blue one back when I woke up (I live in a different country the time is different) I was surprised to see it and then I kinda missed the robo music seeing the blue one after 2 monts makes it look empty :&lt;
---
Iam not sure if this is a thing or not but I think they get better the higher ur trophy is
---
You will have to do that within 20 seconds though
---
But if you are f2p
---
No it‚Äôs fine, people just sucked a couple months ago and didn‚Äôt like the idea of creativity.
---
15.1k and 1 legendary

So why do u use crow as ur Logo

I know

It doesn't look that bad imo
---
Y e s it looks cute
---
Cuz i'm in crow gang
---
Work? This work basically IS the game. And the difference is 30 gems.
---
if there isnt a brawler that can pierce through boxes I can handle them. 
---
unless it's a bull. too much hp
---
Oof sorry

r/lostredditors

Pretty good

sorry master poco.

Colt with Demolition does more damage if he hits all his shots

O dang it i didnt thought you can remake her so much! She looks way better than previous concept!

Well the enemy team wins, but they don‚Äôt get cups, because they are not in the game

they probably didn't know about it

Its not even supposed to be funny. I was angry and disgusted by your behaviour

I have 207 worth of boxes saved so I‚Äôm in the same boat as you. I‚Äôm just waiting for a new brawler. So then with all the boxes I get a lot of gold, tickets, gems, and token doublers.
---
open few of the boxes
---
You don't get the legendary lol
---
Say Spike right now
---
Meanwhile, i have 13 brawlers to uograde and no gold for them

Its rot

Me:*muffled shouting* no we won‚Äôt!

Is that even a accomplished anymore lmao

Yes do you want supercell to give you an award for being in leaderboards
---
Lv.3 bull before the trophy balance update :)

Rico whit super and bull whit damage
---
Sad but when did you get your first epic I bet it's less than 7000
---
It is Bolt. :)
---
That's sad u got both star powers for colt
---
Hmmmmmm
---
10k is not that big of a deal anymore, order for that to happen you need to have at least 16k
---
Well, I wouldn't say no to a reward, but I'm not expecting one. I posted this because this is the first time I've been on the leaderboard and I feel good about it.

You are great ; ALSO some fucking noob guy said he was still missing brawlers at 4000 HE HAD 24 TWO WERE LEGENDARY WHY IS HE COMPLAINING

Well before opening that Mega Box,I had to open 17 Brawl Boxes and 1 Brawl Box.

Haven't seen this word in years

What even is this

it was about 7000 but a little less so like 6950ish

No ur good

Because 80% of the time you rush mid on that map you get teamed on by 3-9 people

not citing credit, also would never work because there are these things called timezones.
