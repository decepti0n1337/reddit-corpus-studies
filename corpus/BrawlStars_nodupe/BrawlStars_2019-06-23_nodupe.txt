You know, I think this all started when the bat character came out... It was a blunt to the head so hard he pushed me back. But you know, I don‚Äôt remember any of that happening. üòÇ
---
No, they are still in 2019
---
It takes way to long, and I hate losing because I can‚Äôt hit a Shelly even though I have 15 power
---
This kills me inside. This is why I quit brawstars I rage too much
---
I just searched about him. Not even bothered opening the videos, I am not giving him 1 view more lol

It‚Äôs an unfair part of the game mode
---
I thought my left earbud broke for a sec
---
Oof, i feel like im going to get my first legendary when i get to 6k, just got darryl today
---
Lol that was quick, never expected someone to search this Baxtrix bastard up on yt
---
Love it
---
REEEEEEEE
---
And it allows for people to benefit from being killed
---
Anybody else find Carl‚Äôs voice highly annoying?!?
---
Yes dynamike deserves that
---
I never heard about him lol
---

---
Wrote his name, saw first 10 suggestions, and closed the app. The worst part about these youtubers is they have some people following them lol
---
There Gem gemmy gemmy gem
---
Yeah I think so
---
Yes! :9

Np

I‚Äôd be happy to help while playing on my mini (13k main) Click this link to add TrevorFreeCarry as a friend in Brawl Stars! https://link.brawlstars.com/invite/friend/en?tag=22JRCG9QQ&amp;token=ms6wg3sm

The plot THICCENS
---
Wrong template dude. You could‚Äôve used the brawl stars one
---
I expect you to post this there
---
Yeah soz I only use my right one when in game lol
---
If you comment on a repost and he starts arguing and spamming more reposts, ignore it.
---
Mostly young kids around 8 or 9 because that's bassicky 80% of the youtube population. Plus I swear Baxtrix makes more clickable videos than Morgz does lol
---
yeah, e barbs are trash but really annoying if overleveled
---
Sacrifice your self so long as you can land some shots for the super and then launch most effective super landing on the most gathering of bushes and walls, works well also in that bush map whereyou can make borders
---
Nice
---
oh
---
Why so down bro?
---
I have failed your expectations.
---
Estou feliz que voc√™ tenha feito uma conta! Seguiu! ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Yes yes yes yes yes
---
YES!!
---
That's also doesn't work, landing 4 shots with brock and suiciding isn't worth it, you could accidentally kill someone in the process of Terri g your super which will raise your bounty pecel

I agree about your point! With more modes, matchmaking will take longer, which is a con to this idea. I have thought about an idea to change this, thanks!

Hey i got a sick idea. Think you could draw it? I'm thinking to have a ice wizard skin from clash royale for nita. She could be the ice wizard, and summom an ice golem instead of a bear. üëåüèª
---
Thanks üòÅüëå
---
Supercell gives youto use the old account after delete and download, try to delete, and then download the app
---
Poco may be dead, but he‚Äôs the liveliest Brawler there is
---
Change my damn mind
---
r/imsorrybull
---
Hay day?
---
how about just leave it alone, we need new content, not a rework
---
Wrong sub? Just because his name is Frank doesn‚Äôt mean it pertains to brawl stars. This  would make more sense on r/memes.
---
Nice job it made me laugh. Keep up the hard work. üëç
---
Just think mortis is better really cool brawler. I also personal love Frank tho. But mortis is assassination brawler really fun playing with him. Assassination brawlers
---
Mortis is a tank killer.
---
wtf no chickens are black and I checked that on wikipedia \*totally reliable\*
---
also chickens don't throw poisonous daggers they throw eggs B O I
---
There‚Äôs simply not enough people with that many trophies to create ‚Äúfair‚Äù games at that level, it‚Äôs very common to be matched with people below 500 when you and all your teammates are above 500
---
Ya I agree he is a tank killer
---
BR kkkkk achei q eu era o √∫nico
---
420 is the weed number
---
69 is a sex position
---
I get it. I just thought it was funny XD
---
Its hated because its double time,  rewards and losses. I dont think many people actually hate the actual game mode, just the price that comes when its played.
---
Literally just a screenshot from the Twilight movies

If it's the cute version of love that makes you say "awwww", it's fine. This looks like a mini prom night.

Hello this is customer support for user Joshe2100. We‚Äôve heard you‚Äôd like to file a complaint about his brawlstar account ‚ÄúLilin.‚Äù I will link you to the complaint site of the game momentarily. 
---
https://supercell.com/en/support
---
Please file a complaint from there and so on. If there is anything that I can do to assist you with the complain feel free to reply. Thank you for our time valued customer.
---
However let me address that this isn‚Äôt a crime in the United States of America and Super Cell may or may not update their rules in banning players that have done this.
---
How do you put private up/downvotes
---
I played brawl ball with 2 dynamics on my team, and I was playing mortis. And I still got star player
---
That typing is another way of being sarcastic, don't worry fam
---
I can say, that you ALL. (absolute all BS players) are. freakin'. unlucky. All the time I getting good teammates. I don't saw teammates like that Shelly. No one teammate in my life don't played like that Shelly.  Someone wants kill me, huh? ( sorry for grammar mistakes, my English not so good)
---
Why are u gei?
---
also I can call both bumping and spamming
---
I'm not saying it's not f2p friendly it just heavily favors p2w players haven't you ever thought of those noobs that just unlocked a new brawler that came out and they have to face pros who have gemmed that brawlers to Max don't u think that's unfair
---
*Ooooo goodness*
---
This is the shit I fucking love to see. Thank you for restoring my hope in this sub.
---
It seems like every time I unlock a new character and start grinding out trophies I get quite a few matches like this. Is this normal?
---
He looks like he‚Äôs about to eat kaneki
---
I don't like this idea. Tap fire is just a great add on to the game, because it allows you to fire all your shots at once. If we took it out then all close range brawlers would get nerfed bad (except mortis). I mean, unless you only allow all long ranged brawlers in this game mode I'm fine.
---
You must one lucky person meteors is completely luck based and does the opposite of what it's supposed to its aggravating getting targeted by it for a whole game and honestly they could make better event modifiers that replace it on the fly coz I don't think anything could be worse
---
they take down low effort but not stolen posts? ü§î woah
---
I saw many posts about account locking for no reasons, there's no solution except just waiting. Supercell support team responses hell late.
---
There's one thing I remember from that posts, if support team responses you they will ask you questions like when your acc made, when is your first purchase etc. Don't response wrong answers.
---
I hope you would do a 2nd one
---
Crying F
---
its aggravating in duos, but it's a lot of fun using the meteors to your advantage- and it's completely dodgeable... unlike the effing rockets from boss fight
---
So?
---
We have the same trophy count but I have 2 less brawlers than you
---
F L E X
---
For real though, nice job
---
Make this a skin
---
Yeah, thats the current process right, sorry for me being rash, i get worked up about communicating on this sub due to past experiences
---
It's based on trophies, not power level. They're basically P2W or dropped trophies.
---
I did this with shelly
---
Format gets no respect. This is so sad.

Just a recolor

---
Wtf
---
Do bill and el primo next
---
Is that like a personal attack or something?
---
Can you tell me how to report because I don‚Äôt know how to
---
Maybe he is a below average player that can't climb higher? U should look at exp level
---
iM deTeCtiNg sEisMiC aCtiViTy
---
You're here!!! üòÉ it's me Kitsune Bibi painter!
---
You can't get your brawlers to 0 because you don't lose trophies if you have 30 or less.
---
It‚Äôs actually mortis vs mortis and dynamike
---
He‚Äôs lying
---
No star player needed. The MVP is the continuous health decrease
---
Is it just me or is this a repost?
---
He‚Äôs Zohar
---
Instead of that just add a trophy multiplier like:
---
√ó2 doubles win trophies or lost trophies. 
---
Rare as getting star powers last for one hour, maximum of 3.
---
√ó3 for one game would be good as well. 
---
Stacks to 20.  2%
---
Also story mode/w gems and story mode characters and or storymode exclusive skins.
---
Can play in teams.
---
Then if that happen , heist,bounty,brawl ball,seige should make to 14 maps each to balance since the rotation is two weeks rotation
---
Maybe it really did take him 5 hours to do what he did
---

Absolutely correct.

that wouldn't be fair cos the long range brawlers will just team up.
---
Ya don‚Äôt say?
---
Omg haha lol bilil your mom screaming go fast check it little guy
---
Not bad
---
Also it has all the maps ever made and many more.
---
Same. I have every brawler except for leon and bibi so i just kinda got bored. I know a lot of people complain about not getting brawlers but grinding for the brawlers is what makes the game worth playing imo. Trust me when i say this the game becomes a lot less exciting when you pretty much have everyone.
---
So bull is in not bad but carl and rosa are FANTASTIC? bullshit tier list

Don't

I'm 8K and highest power lvl is 8 as well, thought it was gonna be easy to get a power 9 but now I realize its harder lol

Come on you could have put (mortified) instead of (modified)

Dev Build is only for popular YouTubers.

Then that means 279 users are completely retarded. Its not that your opinion is unpopular, its just that everyone else just has such a narrow point of view don't listen to them

What happened to his legs?
---
Sir,the police on their way

Lol stupid question, I only play my brawlers until they are maxed.

Wow i love it

I think its private now or something. I used to be able to see it, now i cant

Wtf are u saying can u repeat?

I like it.

Cause I'm 10k now but still missing Crow and Leon, while most of my lower-trophied friends have all brawlers
---
Mortis should be eating dinnermike
---
Vide bal sou yo!
---
Shit post
---
Jessie is the last in KairosTime's newest tier list
---
F for Jessie
---
A friend of mine unlocked everyone except of Crow (and Bo, though he's a trophy road so yeah) with EASE, but got bored of the game soon after he unlocked Gene and Leon, who were the last brawlers he unlocked. My brother is a similar case, except he still plays the game.
---
New brawler is a heavyweight?
---
Tap on the message and press report
---
they should increase the chances globally anyway, it's ridiculous the way it is. Specially when they add new legendaries, which the pattern seems to point the next one is.
---
I‚Äôm just getting my pump on for Brawl Talk üòõ
---
The thing is I played one game with him, we obviously lost. He sent me a friend request, then a group invite just so he could curse me out.
---
The thing is Supercell is hiving me this offer when i don't even have enough coins.
---
A ticketed event could be playing on that week‚Äôs most voted map?
---
Oo lucky
---
You should be thankful, after the long time I have been through I think getting a Star Power on the first day is better than getting a legendary
---
Thank you!
---
Ryan looking hot with the mustache
---
lucky you lol
---
You look so happy ryan :)
---
It sure does
---
Oh ok
---
W o w
---
Sorry man, hope you get it soon
---
X to doubt
---
thats really nice. i think if you tweak with the colour palette it will look even better .
---
She‚Äôs overrated.
---
because besides making a game for kids, the devs aren't kids and don't care about that number.
---
You look so happy ryan

So much to love about this picture

---
ffs you guys post a ss here everytime you see a 69 on your screen
---
Just Monika
---
ya but ive seen teaming brocks and pipers and they one shot primos
---
yeah but you can get them. in this case it's not easy but what if the next trophy road had coins? or if you opened many boxes. there's no point complaining
---
This looks so familiar i was wondering if i was watching myself play
---
Sadness
---
The art style looks like soviet cold war propaganda.
---
El Primo means ‚ÄúThe Cousin‚Äù in English, so...
---
The crow painting post was mine you had posted but i forgive you cause you did the right think
---
There is literally no way i'm gonna collect enough coins before that offer disappears,that's why i'm complaining.
---
I appreciate you're making these templates, im just hoping it won't get abused and I'll see bad memes when sorting by new.
---
Now Now Now Now Now or Today XD
---
Wow I think supercell should remove meteor I think it causes more teaming (BTW the way look at my name)  üñï teamers.
---
All the better
---
Bibi is not that even good TBH save for legendary sale instead.

Did you call
---
yeah but maybe someone will. it's great they offer you the exact amount you need to upgrade your brawlers
---
I was unlocking my friend's 1200 box and I got Frank from it, and he already had Pam, Piper, Gene, Mortis and Spike
---
Frank already confirmed on Twitter that a Tara remodel won't be in this update
---
Wait 'till heist.

i don‚Äôt even know how to make a cupcake

Me using your meme, I mean

Be witness to my beautifulness!

ok great. i will do some serious &amp; detailed inveatigstion of elo on your excel spreadsheet tomorrow. for now, i have to go to sleep (at my time zone, it is almost four o'clock in the morning)

True though üòÇ but they provide a page for new players to check out every details

Get some sleep then! Thanks for looking at my post.

I legit hope I see people use your meme.

I swear though if I see overused joke tho-

He has a Mortis pfp, are you really surprised

If thats what you think, why don't you try it out? nobody is going to miss you

oddly satisfying

Shitpost

It's from Brawl Stars Spanish twitter. Use it all you want!
---
Yes, r/MortisGang approves.

Give credit to the spanish Brawl Stars Facebook.
---
I do both... And this is kind of an art, but versatile. And empty
---
Nah that's why I said math... 50% more star keys required to get it, only 40-50% more rewards (so that would at best break even and be worth the same or lesser value for a greater number of star keys)
---
Currently the Big Box is worth 3 regular boxes, increasing it to 4 would only bring up the value by 33% (worse for players) and only bringing up to 5 would bring value up by 66%, which does technically justify this increase in 50% of star keys. In the end when you calculate this out with the correct ratios, the TOTAL value increase would only be 11%: bringing cost up to 15 star keys raises the box rewards from 3 to 4.5 to break even, and the suggestion of it being worth 5 would only bring it up 11% (4.5 to 5). SO what I'm saying is that idk if an 11% increase in value is worth a rework.
---
HOWEVER, I do completely agree that the big box needs a rework.

you should probably take this down before this becomes a big thing, they might sue you for this ( just my thoughts )

The watermark is false.

Yeah he did the same thing

It is over detailed, you should share that on youtube in details, if you are a youtuber

at least it‚Äôs fun to watch

Playing with randoms be like:

---
From rank1 ?
---
*zip sounds
---
I was camping and then 2 teaming Brocks come close by (1 with drink) and I got killed instantly
---
When you die in gem grab but your poison kills the enemy gem carrier and now your El primo has 10 gems.
---
Actually, he stole it from the Spanish Brawl Stars Facebook page. He just passed it on as his own without giving credit.
---
Zion Williamson
---
Nice!
---
Do you have some tutorial to do this type of coloration?
---
You should have aimed for the head!
---
Deogracio stole it. Then, this guy made it into a meme.
---
"I've looked forward in time to see how many Brawlers you would get"
---
"And how many did you see?"
---
"None"
---
Tell us what u got. I can't wait anymore. I haven't slept last night because of this
---
I almost went to YouTube when I saw that. Lmao
---
I read it in 0 sec, bcoz i was watching the vid in the upper, then i peek at this then, but i wasted 40 seconds of my life for typing this
---
Me and my responsibilities
---
Fucking r etard even if he did steal it this guy stole it too, so they both stole it, downvote and report both of the r etards
---
Facebook. Not twitter.
---
Nvm then
---
I wil try make a body
---
Yes, he is.
---
I must find him
---
The FBI is almost here...i can feel it

Well I‚Äôm pretty sure other ytbers did this as well

He apparently use the template to make meme and that's all, but he doesn't give credit for the "creator of the template"

Lol i have the same brawlers remaining but at 8k

The mask reminds me of the Persona series even tho im not a fan

Awesome art !!

*When you can't draw better than this*

But you‚Äôre the mom!

Oh no, a free loot box has lower roll chances than a paid loot box on a FREEMIUM mobile game?!?!?!? How dare Supercell!!!!

I did too one time.

excuse me what the frick

There's always a bigger fish.

Tbh I'm fine with Poco as he is. He is a really good support for tanks

Glad you like it ^^ im still going to redraw it later

Dude just use "contact mods" he will become *not exist*
---
So? I have a mom too lol
---
then get out of my bush
---
Really? How do you know?
---
or I'll super you
---
Yeah he is a great support troop. Hos damage is what should be buffed. He struggles to even take out Nitas bear.

Ok!!!

Das pretty good

Yes

Nice work!
---
If you are gonna steak art, do it properly
---
That could be how he did it. You wouldn't know if he stole it unless you see this post before on reddit
---
Anyway
---
Supercell don't care fore the amazing Ideas
---
thiccooo ricoo

Looks really nice! Keep up the great work!

Is that who I think it is?

I see it now
---
El premo gold
---
exactly
---
Idk why ppl says its overpowered i have 10K trophies but spike with 350 trophies trying to push it
---
Tell Jordan to fix his name.
---
Hah!
---
Of course not!
---
New Carl remodel
---
I got leon from a free small box in the shop
---
Doesn't make sense lmao The guitar rrings will break
---
Same. Duo teamers are about the worst a person can get.
---
He did not claim it was his but it still isnt his and that's stealing. So you're saying u can steal $100k worth of gold and then when ur mom asks "wtf this isnt urs!" U can just say "lol i didnt say it was mine" and then ur not stealing? What logic is that
---
A new fingering mechanic
---
Excuse me what the fuck

My best is 36 sec

Is possible, but everyone on Gem Grab is #EL PRIMO!!!!!

There goes his will to live.

Hey um just so u know nita is a boy
---
I have Poco at 500 too :3

Estou impressionado com a quantidade de artes que voc√™s v√™m roubando de mim. E muito ser cara de pau mesmo. Pegam minhas artes, apagam o nome e postam aqui, vou da um jeito nisso. Vou den√∫ncia voc√™s. N√£o sei se voc√™s esqueceram mas... as artes s√£o minhas. Tenho mais do que provas de que eu sou o autor disso, vou denunciar cada arte minha que eu encontra aqui üòë
---
XD Hahaha
---
Yea Jessie‚Äôs turret and Nita‚Äôs bear are still too strong, what I think of is nerfing both of their star powers in Big Brawler or even just make them not useable, and increase the number of shots they need to charge their super, make the turret and bear damage not count into their super charge, etc etc, just in general nerf their companions
---
So satisfying
---
I'm impressed by the amount of gear you've been stealing from me. It's a lot to be the same guy. They take my gear, erase the name and post it here, I'll find a way around it. I'll report you. I do not know if you forgot but ... the arts are mine. I have more than proof that I am the author of this, I will denounce every art of mine that I find here
---
Those are some okay ideas, I have some suggestions to improve:
---
1. Kang is good by himself, it's great that you thought of a way to include his (her?) main feature - the pouch.
---
2. Since Brawl Stars is a kid's game, it has a very high population of immature children and I'm not sure what effect Doc Dead throwing syringes would have on them.
---
3. I'm not sure about Mustafa. He needs tweaking here and there, and also you were just a little unclear on him.
---
4. Meddy is okay as well but her super is just too overpowered. For reference, you can hardly escape a Frank super, which only lasts 3 seconds!
---
5. Why did you give avay your age? Edit it out before anyone sees it.
---
6. Your e-mail address too? You're not supposed to share that on the internet!
---
I miss hot maze
---
EL PRIMO IS HERE

I will stay in my opinion and thats TRU he is ballanced and playable just watch Brawl tv and you will see how he can be strong
---
Penny's! They might nerf it, so get Shelly's right after if you can.
---
Bull: But..but that's my role!

Poor Poco.

I fucking love Ryan!

Because what is gonna el primo to do in this meta?...

Maybe only make fight with another el primo

I don't like it either. We're all just casuals!
---

Everything
---
How many trophies do you have i have 8.1k
---
Love it! What about the Frank that dies before he even loads into the game? Every third game I manage to pick off someone at the start who is afk or slow to load!
---
As you can see, the skull is tye dead bull who got killed by the shelly
---
Stolen
---
still around 3.2k
---
Wait, if I got this right, you're asking to... delete... a brawler...?
---
your hands hurt from stealing someone else's art and say it's yours?  PATHETIC

This is a late reply but sure

Supercell...

FIX YOUR FUCKING GAME

Absolutely no one:

Penny: YeaAaAaAahh!!

Oof

Must have been carried the whole time or your definitely lying after you said that last part about it‚Äôs a Brock map but not a Piper map lmao
---
 Brawl Talk is ready!!!!!!!!

Ok nobody cares

very cool but i feel the charm of the original template was the facial expressions

oooh i'm so dumb

AHAHAHAHAHHAHA
---
And they say endgame was the most ambitious crossover
---
I call people hacker ironicaly
---
I had a bot 1 today who scored own goals on purpose in brawl ball
---
Yeah just talking on solo mode, but the report button is other idea that could let you spin on every mode with no in game trouble, only a ban if you teamed up on solo
---
*mike is dying*
---
Wow what an amazing play!
---
#So satisfying to see this as a Mortis. Well done Frank.
---
Sure thing go ahead!
---
This image is perfectly fine
---
I thought about upvoting until I saw your name
---
It's next saturday.
---
Happens to me every time. Like wtf it never hits anyone teaming, it only hits people staying quite minding their own business. Also in duo showdown, it would target me and my teammate when we are together. Like wtf. This made me and my teammate die in duo showdown at once
---
Bo is really good on this map, just use him.
---
Kid: *dies*

Roblox character: Oof

How are you too 200 with 259 trophies

Well, some days ago he post a image of a incoming comic who "he and his friend were doing"and recently appears this post of the creator: https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/c48jzf/minha_cria√ß√£o_brawalstars_hist√≥ria_em_quadrinhos/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
The creator post the picture and he said he will report all the art thief, guess what, Deogracio deleted the post
---
They even went to the extent to label it the biggest update yet on the App Store
---
üëäüèº
---
therapeutic as heck
---
Dappy hake cay
---
Pewdiepie should play Brawl Stars
---
It's not suppose to be laughing. It's more of something you point out when you see it. At least for me.
---
Yeah true that, but lets think on other things like my to answers before the report button we could do a in match change that helps with this issue, like the iddle disconnect message
---
Replace leon with tara and then we're getting places
---
Maybe, just maybe.
---
Flashbacks to their lives

No human language can describe the disappointment I'm feeling right now
---
Got the pic
---
*every iteration(calm down ill delete my comment once he fixes it)
---
what does that russian tag mean? i see it everywhere
---
now I know. even because it was just today that I discovered that they are stealing my arts, but I will not have it any more. now they're going to fuck up because I'm going to find a way to get the name in a way they will not have to steal, they can even post. but they will not get the name
---
Also B R O C K  G V N G

Show me that picture

I agree with all the other suggestions

This, this puts a smile on my face.

Tara is ma name , sucking the f*** out to f people with my super is my game
---
That‚Äôs Beautiful ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Back in beta, the support team was pretty cool, but they only helped people they liked. One of my friends IRL changed his name to something stupid and asked to have it changed and was denied, he more demanded a name change I think. While another friend of mine also changed his name to something stupid, and support changed it without complaint, I assume he was a bit more polite
---
Ur welcome
---
Tara is my name, getting nothing not even a skin is my game
---
Robots dont have feelings

That‚Äôs me when a new brawler comes out

Why hello there

Way back in this subreddit.  I also made a dragon brawler named Milton.  I've always wanted to rework him, but my stylus for drawing broke,  and I haven't been able to for a while

I'm saying this because this guy looks *WAY* better than anything I could draw up. He totally fits the style of Brawl Stars.
