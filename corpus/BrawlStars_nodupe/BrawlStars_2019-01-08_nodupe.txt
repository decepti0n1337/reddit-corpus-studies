Last time in brawl stars you could make your name have a colour by putting /c or something like that.
---
The game got more kid friendly
---
I was extremely polite to O.P and he was extremely rude in return, so I am just being honest about how bad this post is. I think you're  stressing about it more than I am.
---
Why did that Bull use his Super to change into the gas?
---
My first mortis match was in stormy plains 
---
thank you auto mod for correcting me the all caps in the title was a bit extreme!
---
I know I’m bad guys stop roasting me. I was just trying to point out that I’ve never seen a brawler die after the match was over. I know that I fairly lost.

if you want to see your box odds, go to the shop, tap on any of the boxes, then tap the “i” on the top left corner

Maybe scale the box with club size?

ya i remember those days, i miss when leon wasn’t a brawler even tho i have him
---
Np his good rn maybe damage buff
---
I want him to have low hp compare to other shotgunners 
---
What do you think mods even do then?
---
Thats some dickheads
---
Yeah honestly, which sucks a lot, probably something to do with my phone
---
looks good, but honestly seems a little complicated. i’d recommend making the mid a bit more easy to access, or adding bridges across the water so that you’re not trapped.

I got Leon through a regular brawl box

Ok first how does not releasing balance changes make them more money? Also, the tournament isn’t affecting their ability to work on the game because the dev team isn’t working on the tournament. Finally, this meme just doesn’t make sense. I’m pretty sure you’re trying to say that supercell is making a tournament instead of releasing balance changes because they want money. In this case why would the tournament be stopping balance changes from getting more money as this meme portrays. It just doesn’t make any sense if you think about it at all.
---
Do they still use dynamite in any game modes?
---
I really like this idea! I also think there should be a small point reward (1-2 extra points) for playing with club members in a match to encourage teamwork and knowing the people in your club.
---
all the dumb cr kids have learned from there mistakes and are now big bois with common sense and realize u cant hack supercell games
---
I love that he throws mini versions of himself
---
It will match you not based on levels but based on the trophies of whoever is highest on your team. Levels do not matter for matchmaking. In this case your team would be facing people with around 550 trophies.
---
I would Definetly buy this
---
Ha, Bo in C tier? Nice joke, man lol
---
It’s really hard to throw the minimum range without just having it revert to auto-aim, for sure 
---
teamer deserve cancer (the animal) in the ass
---
Dude i ain't talking about the trophies.. its unfair a level 4 frank to play against a lvl 10 spike.. you missing the point.. the trophies are the key to abusing matchmaking.. the powers are the thing am talking about
---
So meteors that suck you in
---
*/s*
---
Bear!!!!!!!!!!
---
Supers are charged in hits, not damage. Let’s say a super needs 5 hits to charge, and a brawler shoots 10 hits but only hit half of them. He would get his super
---
Am I the only one who thinks that Jessie looks like a burger when you're in the gameplay (from the top)?
---
shouldnt be on showdown since that chest should promote club members to play with eachother
---
Oh god... 2 no skins, that's unfair to the enemy team, i fell bad for them.
---
All jokes aside, Yeah that's unfair for your team lol
---
I know it's grazi that he can go over water but Darryl also can do that, in his way XD
---
lvl1 crook
---
13 levels more, and the trophies diference is also big.
---
I feel you xD
---
*Nice* **BUT LOOK AT THIS**
---
Pretty sure someone posted this here before
---
Piper should be A, best brawler for dealing with poco and in bounty 
---
Anyone who can break or jump over walls is the best.
---
Random. 
---
Now imagine getting teleported smack dab in the middle of a gap or something and being stuck for the rest of the map. 
---
lfeeding 
---
It took awhile to get those things in Clash Royale. It's gonna be the same thing for Brawl Stars. Either find some friends and just play with them or just keep doing dailies...
---
Mmmm... Okay, that's kinda accurate. Poor Mortis tho, and Primo S in Showdown? What dream are you living? lol.
---
Not bad for my Nita, Straight A's and just one B, I'm proud of my girl lol.
---
It depends on the map but Primo has an amazing early game with block breaking.  That early lead in Power makes him unstoppable late game after a few kills.  Hes my favorite character.
---
And of course, level 10 Frank wins
---
Checked your history hoping to see more of your work.  Bummed it came back empty. You'll need to post more!  Great talent.  Thanks for sharing. 
---
I disagree friend she has a low reload, mediocre super and low health which makes her horrible in every game mode except bounty
---
This would force them to reduce the max amount of members in a club because the whole reason they increased it was because there was nothing like this in the game
---
Wtf is that? Whatever it is, you can tell it's suffering
---
Who cares it’s a video game
---
teaming. if this doesnt exist, there will be no backstab
---
Well he got about 6 untouched boxes and was under 300 trophies. The skill required to win games isn’t much until atleast 350-400. Try getting 4400 trophies and you would find out, and those 4400 trophies are with 11 brawlers cuz I’m unlucky.
---
Just because she's good in one game mood doesn't mean that she should be A overall, if I made a bounty tier which I probably will eventually then she'll be a tier
---
Change Poco with Darryl and Bull with Barley. Darryl may also be higher, but people think he is bad, so don't try to start the same discussion.
---
Also Shelly may be lower
---
That's amazing! So lucky with the untouched boxes tho
---
I've always thought of a teleportation mechanics back then. Great idea!
---
His arrow are slow has mediocre health his super is pretty easy to avoid the only reason I have him that high is because of his star power
---
If only my parents were younger...
---
No need to be childish, “ies!” is out of the question, just boob
---
Yes, just make a recolor black Barley, and add a "ERROR" Sign in his face

---
I will probably remake this family tree and make that possible
---
If anyone can think of a better name i would appreciate it!
---
Yikes, those games would be Showdown
---
Bull has a lot of power and is very viable in almost every game, even in bounty his worst game mode  I've still seen him do well on maps with a lot of grass and walls 
---
Poco does well basically on every game mode except for tickets events his super is good, his attacks has with and range while going through people and his health is pretty good for what he does.
---
What about Boss Fight, Robo Rumble and Big Game?
---
That doesn't mean he has Crow. I don't have Spike. 
---
#FBI OPEN UP 
---
I’m sorry but you’re a little late to the party for that meme
---
Except that they aren't, dude. A ranged brawler is enough to keep them far and kill them with range. Darryl is better than Bull and Shelly because he is actually an assasin, he can get close and kill ranged brawler easy
---
But clearly if you think Shelly and Bull are better than Darryl you don't know a lot about the game...
---
Reminds me of Jessie from Toy Story
---
And range
---
FBI OPEN UP
---
Heist will be insane
---
Agreed
---
Nice! I could definitely see this being added in the future.
---
Yeah the game honestly needs one. Or if you reject an invite maybe have it say “I’m just playing a few games with randoms” or something. Making a mini account is not the greatest solution because you don’t have the same brawlers unlocked, and eventually, you’ll add friends on the mini that will invite you anyways. 
---
nice map
---
You’re able to unlock it from boxes and the shop at lvl 9, once you get it, it brings you to lvl 10
---
Emm.. Wtf ??
---
Uh your statement is a incorrect,  there's millions more players since global release,  so match making  should be very easy considering it is double the amount of people.  
---
What club are you in?
---
First off spike and crow have the same health...
---
Secondly stats literally determine how good a character is what are you on about?
---
Thirdly his versatility is done better by bull a brawler with more health DPs and with a better super (this is debatable tho)
---
Disagree with Frank and Jessie
---
Created with: pixel crux 
---
Colt shoule be higher A at least
---
Spending them in boxes is wrong. You wont secure anything. Its just luck. If you save those gems you got from the packs you could buy brawlers from offers. And thats the best way. Its just about beijg patience. 
---
Thanks for the help!
---
[removed]
---
Called Workaholics, im not the president or anything I just know the vp irl 
---
I'm at 3000 trophies and I'm only missing spike I'm pretty sure I know a fare amount about the game, I've had no problems getting close to a range brawler with bull especially with his high health and pretty good super, and shelly doesnt really struggle with get up close unless if its bounty.
---
What is teaming? I’m new to the game and haven’t experienced it yet
---
Ok. So token doublers it is.. thanks for the helo
---
The middle seems way too hard to get to... 
---
Where two or more people in a FREE FOR ALL showdown game all team up against you. 
---
Its literal cancer... #stopthespin
---
Big Chungus
---
Not he shouldn't, his best game more is heist where he isn't the best at and the rest of the game modes he gets out shined by a lot of better brawlers,

This is awesome!!.. Can I get a BO fanart plss...

Go into the bushes what do I find a fucking bull and Shelly camping
---
7 minutes in heaven.
---
You teamers deserved it, the Bull is clearly doing Supercell's work for them. smh smh
---
I don't understand this problem.
---
If it doesn't work on iPad, I understand that this game is on mobile phone only.
---
But it's not. Chromebook is like a tablet.
---
Thank you.
---
This makes me nostalgic of clash royale
---
Not very high. If u press the info button in the top left corner after pressing the box in the shop u will see ur chances. I suggest u do NOT buy but buy coin doubler instead. It’s much better value.
---
Then how he level five
---
I hate how players respawn behind net 
---
At the time of the global release, 3 new maps for the Gem Grab mode appeared in the game. One of the maps was shown among the New Year's, the rest in my opinion have not been entered to this day. Maps of this mode are not very different from each other and only therefore did not spread them. If you're interested, I can show them.
---
Low. Click on i after clicking on the box. You should see your odds
---
Well if you are, maybe you should post something appropriate for your age
---
Hell yeah
---
Supercell
---
N I T A A A A A
---
I got him a week ago my trophies are in the 1300s now
---
Well it has a total of 12 spawns, so maybe they’re extra?
---
Looks like somewhere Darryl could be decent
---
Its fair.
---
Darryl is incredible. You have to learn how to play with each brawler lol
---
Don’t ever disrespect ghosts death again 
---
Ya man that’d be awesome. I’ve been playing the game since the day it came out in beta and just hearing new things about the game is just super refreshing
---
thats randoms for you. literally dropped almost 100 trophies today.
---
Almost all legendaries 
---
If everyone took that mentality, there’d be no more Brawl Stars.
---
he needs a buff
---
I have good service. Clash royale and all apps load perfectly. So does brawl stars. However, when I reach 100% once I start a game it just gets stuck there. How do I fix it?
---
True just noticed that
---
i hope he didnt use your credit card
---
Just no...
---
I did
---
How
---
While not technically with his super. If you get hit by Frank's chances are he will have another super once he hits you with his normal attacks after you are stunned.
---
bull and primo i keep getting fucked over by those idiot random teamates
---
Too many choke points, throwers OP.
---
Wait a min... thats not 3X the value dafuq. 70 gems= $5 and 180 gems=$10 so I can get 250 gems for $15. 
---
This packages gives 250 gems + 3 mega boxes which is 240 for a total of 490, which is a little less than $30. Isn’t that almost 2X? .......
---
YOUR FEELINGS CHANGE LIKE THE WEATHER
---
WENT FROM CLEAR TO GRAY 
---
ON THAT CLOUDY DA
---
actually you know what, i was playing my max bo on fof recently and just as immune wore off, leon that spawned beside me killed me??? 
---
For the people that didn't notice, he's talking about the power level of each of the brawlers. Don't get upset over the trophies.
---
bruh
---
Ricochet should be S tier or at least A tier. When bouncing becomes a habit his DPS outclasses everyone else in the game especially with his Super which is a glorified Colt Super.
---
If you are considering skill cap then perhaps he should be B tier then because its awkward to play with him at moments. 
---
I would also say that Bo should be B tier. I don't really understand why everyone says he's bad when his autos are in fact reliable and his mines are hella good if you know how to force enemies into certain spots on the map. 
---
Frank is S tier lmao. He doesn't outclass Leon due to his pause between attacks but everyone else he can easily zone out, which is what he's supposed to do. 
---
Barley should be A tier, his damage output is high and has a lot of freedom. He's basically meta all the time except when he is obviously not. 
---
Darryl I would put A tier but perhaps I just like his playstyle so B tier works too I guess.
---
Bear!
---
Luckiest week I've ever had in any game 
---
oh, makes sense now. 
---
I bet on higher trophies you will change your mind about your chart
---
 
---
Good luck :)
---
Yondu beats both easily.
---
So his super makes him take less damage but it says his star power makes his super deal more damage and you never listed how he damaged with his super or even his basic attack
---
I got Leon today in a regular box.
---
Can you imagine driving to a restaraunt just to eat food?
---
Are you promoting bulls?
---
Alright maybe I will
---
I just got Leon today in a regular box!
---
Nice
---
Beautiful
---
Ight to be fair the trick against El primos with Darry is tickle primo with enough damage and then roll in and finish him off. Works 99.99999% of the time guaranteed (source: pushed him to rank 17 at lvl 5) Against shelly, ur fucked and against bull, u can use the tickle method
---
That was a dangerous super lol
---
Lol I saw the name and immediately thought of that, too.
---
Report teamer please
---
I understand what you're going for but there are WAY too many walls. It'd be hard to chase someone down like a bull hiding around ever corner from projectiles and baiting for easy kills
---
If two ranger brawlers are fighting one could easily retreat at low health and you could be punished for trying to finish the brawler off
---
Nah dude read the info tab on boxes. The more boxes you open your luck goes up a little bit 
---
Yeah it seems i got really lucky compared to other people.
---
Posting another :)
---
Wanna pass some of that luck my way? 
---
Never was
---
I Agree
---
I remember him from chess..
---
Idiot Primo
---
I thought the same, a brawler with it but felt like an game mode would fit better 
---
what if you are a bull
---
I don't get texts while playing BrawlStars, but I also don't use messaging apps such as Kik. 
---
Just Default Messenger and Discord, I doubt either would make me lag
---
Dont think they’ve even took any action with this I mean this map isn’t new anyway 
---
Sorry, but I’m confused on the super. What does it do?
---
The first word I read in the title was @(something)Fuzzy(something)
---
Uhuh I would have been first nub ❤️❤️ though
---
Shut
---
Maybe since he slow down (maybe slower then regular brawler) when use super, his detection range should decrease from 4 tile to 2.5 tile? Also make him throw blade slower (just like pam but not as slow as her) so it is harder to land all attacks.

He’s ok in most game modes though. He’s ok in sng, he’s ok in bounty, he’s ok in ball, he’s ok in heist, ok in sd depending on map and robo too
---
Could you imaging going to a bush and finding a bill?
---
I don’t know, maybe a camera?
---
I'm not sure if this is such a great idea
---
If this isnt yours why are you even posting this. 
---
Woops, was meant for Ayerys.
---
Fast as heck*
---
Same opened like 3 trophy road megaboxes and got like nothing from all of them. Losing hope and getting bored of the game 
---
Is this suppose to mean like you get a legendary if you opeknboxes at 5am 😂 
---
If you want brawlers so badly you could buy gems and wait until you can buy an Epic Brawler for 69 gems I believe
---
honestly heist is too easy.It should be win the game for 1-2 points,you have to be careful with gem grab if,you dont balance the rewards correctly it could lead to people throwing just to get 5+ gems or maybe kills.Just go for a simple win the game for 1 point.Brawl ball should be goal 1 point,assist 1 point(to avoid people hogging the ball)
---
Thanks! It’s my first edited video!
---
I'm in Australia. I HAVE to play on mobile, even at home, because our Broadband is mediocre at it's best.
---
Then you happy
---
Yeah 100 trophies is insane beo
---
We can get clubs...?!
---
Really? Thanks!
---
Sometimes you can have poor connection to the server, it happens to my team mates a lot and is mire likely for People not in North America I assume

What is what? 
---
Is this a joke? Because i don't get it.
---
A quick doodle of Mortis I did while waiting for my soup to cook.
---
No hat this time, maybe next time. :P
---
I want to draw Bull, Colt, as well as Rockabilly Mortis in 1 picture together soon. 
---
What do you guys/gals think? 
---
Maybe other brawler combos?
---
When Fortnite events happen u get points by a mix of the kills u had and the position u were each game and progress the temporary ladder, no battle royal rewards 0 kill people camping, even in fortnite no good player just camps, u have to get loot and invest in killing ur competition, the changes i am proposing are bound to happen someday because thats the only logical evolution, i just want them to happen faster.
---
Stop flexing bruh
---
Just a 1000 difference ? there should be a mechanism that calculates the number of kills required depending on 3v3 victories, power and trophies of brawlers of club members
---
Colt doesn’t reload when he shots and Rico has his range nerfed
---
Does anyone agree with me for auto aim nerf?
---
1) They spin to show that they want to create a team, and other players spin too with their brawlers. They spin back again if they agree to team, and attack/run away when they don't want them to join. 
---
2) Once above 300 trophies with a certain brawler (untill 500 trophies) you get positive trophies in top 5 and negative trophies in top 10-6. The non-teamers lose trophies, the teamers get trophies. This is what frustrates most anti-teamers.
---
Just trying to show how jokes the mm can be
---
good but not the best, building this mechanism is a long task and the game has just gone global they'll first fix bugs and basic things before adding new features, sooner or later expect it
---
How long did the matchmaking take?
---
In Brawl Ball, can the player with the ball be teleported? 
---
Curious to know
---
Can players with gems be teleported?
---
This idea is cool, but abusable, immunity for 3 seconds with a 15 second countdown. I mean, what’s stopping players from hopping right back into that teleport after they get out, so that they are immune from damage for another 3 seconds? Wait out the clock for that 15 seconds
---
Normally, it matches teams after the highest brawler trophies (and many other things that are less important), but if matchmaking takes to long, they will slowly become less important, to make you find a match in the first place. If your matchmaking takes forever, you should exit it, if you want to avoid this kind of matches.
---
Yea, it was made up by someone 
---
I appreciate the editing of this pic more than the Idea XP
---
The level 15 bonus deal is better value than doubler if you are gonna buy gems
---
I have 19 aswell and ive only spent 20 bucks only one i bought was piper
---
OK
---
Took my idea, or thought rather. Completely true for lobbing characters
---
Lol why are you getting downvoted

He actually becomes a good brawler with it so yes
---
Hee hee
---
Lmao
---
It’s Bruce already
---
barley
---
LMFAO he posted the names and brawlers
---
No it's just the normal rotation of the robo Rumble maps. 
---
Spike and I don’t even have him
---
Ohh yeah, my bad! 
---
So cute
---
Same same
---
The solution should be if you request then there should be a cooldown before inviting again, or move the invite requests to somewhere not in the middle..
---
I can’t believe I only need 6 more brawlers after weeks of getting nothing
---
Netscape
---
Have you tried with your cellular data?
---
Why are my enemies dealers and team up to crash my bull
---
Is ok
---
Flex that colt jonny op
---
Cool. That's going to change when you face decent opponents.
---
Wow how u do that 
---
Imho wouldn't be a good idea for other gamemodes, in showdown that may put an end on teaming and that is awesome, but.. for the other gamemodes people will try to make lot of points and focus on it beside their roles and gamemode, especially on random games.
---
Yes, just started! Okay thanks. Do you have any advice for a new player?
---
Finally someone who doesn’t spam auto
---
Thank you!
---
Spike
---
You started it :) Go back to Jesus dude, he will help you and make the world a beter place just for you :)
---
You must unlock all career brawlers up to BO, then unlock all Mythic + Rare + Epic brawlers until legendary brawlers are only unlock able. That being said you’ll prolly get a spike or crow :((
---
Moi j'aime bien 😂
---
I didn't start anything at all. I'm ignoring you now, ok?
---
😍
---
 Bring Pam! She rocks Thousand Lakes and she can deal with Leon better than most. Unless you’re one of the Leon’s ofc.. in that case, I hate you! ;)
---
Thanks :) what do you mean?
---
I have all brawlers but not Crow nor Leon, I also have all PP, and still no offer. Maybe tomorrow 🙄
---
Even Leon can’t win a 1vs3 game if his teammates are stupid.....
---
That’s not that bad I get matches against brawlers with 600 trophies and all 10’s and get destroyed
---
hihi
---
You smelly hipster
---
People who critices Darryl might use your advices instead of saying he's just a bad brawler
---
I have all the other characters except the legendaries 
---
Yes :-)
---
You destroyed it lol
---
I’d like a ricochet guide since i suck with him
---
Not at all .. that’s not even the same mechanic ... range or area as long range brawlers . Unlike shotgunners which have the same area and range ... and nope I just turned 18. It’s funny because people who usually ask other people age is young themselves . 
---
Wow. Suddenly I want to main Darryl.
---
There is probably better chance getting all legendaries and mythics in 1 box than that.
---
Why would they not? They have the statistics, they can clearly see that a decent chunk of the playerbase has made their name colored, and if they revert that to include a bunch of code instead, people will likely just quit
---
Also, it would make names go over their character limit, which could mess things up even worse
---
Darryl is not like the other shotgunners. He’s way more versatile.
---
13seconds is the fastest I've seen and my fastest time is 17seconds I was baffled when I saw 13 &amp; 15
---
If someone played jessie or penny u would be dead 
---
What do you think trophies and brawler rank are for them??? 
---
Brawler IS a ranked game despite robo rumble boss fight and friendly room everything is ranked in this game 
---
Why do y’all post your losses? Just because you suck doesn’t mean you have to show it off.
---

My crow got to 522 in FoF and Rockwall Brawl, only to drop to 483 today. Gg tho
---
:)
---
Maybe just all gamemode kills
---
Remove the bushes ffrom the center
---
Bro you're at 0tr.... People don't even know how to play or it's probably even bots against you to make sure you learn the way to play so your post is irrelevant 
---
25% kinda much isn't it? xD
---
? Do u even play this game? 
---
You renamed to Hillopeia right? 😜
---
Love it
---
Phat upvote

Rush B

Lucky girl
---
Thank you. Due to the fact that his star power would be pretty OP,  I thought in giving him the lowest health as possible (so that it wouldn't be difficult to kill him and get the gems or ball back). However, some changes still have to be done yet. If you got any in mind tell, I would like to here it. Gracias. Yo también soy de Argentina, un saludo. 
---
Leon. He is way too hard to play.
---
That's the time remaining
---
It is too closed off I feel like a lot of characters would be rendered useless here and getting the ball across would be close to impossible.
---
YOU'VE BEEN GNOOOOOOOOOOOMMMMMEEEEEEED 
---
This feels a little bit gaym
---
Shouldn't we keep posting instead of make it silence?
---
It means they didn't fix it and more and more player run into this bug?
---
Ps: I didn't see this bug posted before and didn't search it either
---
El primo is balanced

---
well... after watching that video I feel this picture explains my luck with the game.[my thoughts](https://imgur.com/a/IM8vCuq)
---
Lol, where are caps
---
Of course that's the reason. All the newcomers are playing the easiest brawlers. They just don't want to aim.
---
But again, I wonder if Supercell is concerned about this. Probably they just give a shit. But their game its flooded by Shellys and Bulls in every mode and every SD map right now and I don't think im the only one getting tired of this.
---
Thank you for bringing this type of content.

---
She don’t skips day
---
The concept is good the name is suggestive 😂😂
---
Awesome!!
---
agreed
---
Relyhh was top at 17k 2 seasons ago but now he’s on 13k and in 141st place so once you hit 11k you really have to put in the time to grind your way to the top. By the time you hit 11k its safe to say your brawlers are almost max if not already, so the thing about power levels isn’t as crucial unless its something specific like bo’s power or whatever. So the gems thing isn’t really a biggie... its another gem that they have they you don’t, and it’s called the Time Stone. With it they can grind till kingdom come which most average players cannot. p.s. if you think players at 16k are not any better than the average player after watching them play then... wait, are you CanYaDigit?
---
Honestly I was having such a hard time being successful with this guy, this is so incredibly helpful. Would love to see Frank next!
---
weird flex but ok
---
i'm not going to open boxes anymore, thanks
---
It wasent 666 but like 675 or the exact number of coins I had 
---
A nita guide would be nice!
---
what the hell xD
---
I see this everywhere and usually they just camp in the middle so I let them take care of each other  
---
I have crow and I think it's hard to balance, crow does a surprising amount of damage when all three daggers hit. Imo he could be buffed by letting his poison overlap when enemys are tagged mutiple times instead of resetting the poison timer.
---
Bo master race 
---
They could enable replays at anytime they want right now, but it would add much stress to the current servers because it has to record every single coordinates of all brawlers every single time. Spectating, however, just replicates the coordinates of the brawlers without having to record them for later. In Clash Royale, the game records the coordinates where the cards have been placed and the AI reproduces the battle again. That's some glitches or bugs with cards probably won't appear in replay after the battle.
---
Not even , rico is so easy once you get the hang of him, he was the first brawler that clicked with me before I got Tara &amp; Leon. He's too nice in brawl ball especially, same concept as darryl. Keep attack where the main area is (usually where the ball spawns/lands after battle) and once you get his super you can literally keep spamming it and recharging it over and over. I got like 300 trophies with him in one sitting just from brawl ball.
---
I think you’ll be fine lol. God forbid there is negative opinion tho, omg right?!
---
Saw this three times today, one for overwatch, one for rocket league, and now this
---
Pipel
---
cool
---
Yeah that's good!  Maybe introducing that like a weekly( or daily but with a weekly final result) with an extra bonus if you complete all those objectives would be nice!
---
The only thing I'd like to change is showdown,  your suggestion (1st-2nd place etc) is perfect for a duo showdown, for Solo showdown kills were better because it potentially stop the teaming.
---
I'd also like to add a Leaderboard for clubs based on those points, so the best organized 
---
and flawless club could climb that.
---
Such a lucky boi
---
My first was jessie
---
I think I was the one who tested that 
---
But saving boxes doesn't increase your chance 🤔
---
??
---
Yeah but personally if it was an evergreen mechanic on showdown I would never play it. 
---
You‘re welcome 😆😁😂
---
Are you saying that you are pro t series
---
What is wrong
---
Ok 
---
O que é kibou? Se é algo como plágio eu juro que essa skin foi feita totalmente por mim.
---
can you provide name of video. i don't understand this one.
---
I lose 111 lifepoints every second
---
This is the life leech mod
---
Genius
---
sounds like  low level crow
---
And his super can go through walls like bull.
---
PewDiePie has 80 million
---
You're so great 
---
Well... some characters  are as simple as: be far away and shoot (sorta like colt); or be close up and shoot (sorta like bull). And if someone typically stays back then they will do better with colt, and if someone pushes crazily then Bull would be better. And of course different supers reward different playstyles. While i usually would agree with what you’re saying, the diversity in how you can use different characters generally doesn’t allow you to have the same skill level with every character. Hope that answers your question. 
---
die cancer idiot
---
He’s not hacking, he shot you at point blank range with a triple barrel barrel shotgun and 4 power cubes. Correct me if I’m wrong, but I think that’s around 3000 damage; more than your health at the time.
---
I love darryl and these is a master peace
---
Whats this?
---
Yeah, he’s a beast if you know how to play him!
---
She also has Brock, as do a couple other people who are no where near 1000 trophies
---
Before Bo was a Trophy Road unlock, you could pull him from boxes.
---
personally i would have loved the skin or icon :(
---
Awesome!! Nice work dude.. BO pleeeaaase!! 😅
---
It's basically an extra friends list right now.
---
That was the rational thing to do
---
Damn, that sucks.
---
ATOMIC YOU FORGOT THAT LEON GIVES OFF A SHADOW !
---
lol it is a fan made brawler
---
How did you find this 10 days late
---
That’s how mafia works
---
That would be kinda cool if all the OBs had a big “OB” stamped on there player profile 
---
[Trash players rn](https://i.imgur.com/0gnZlb1.jpg)
---
Oh my bad
---
Dope
---
I got him to 509 and somehow managed to push to 522 with randoms in duo showdown
---
Oh, I didn’t
---
Its not all their games. I played clash of clans for years, no issues. Ive been playing clash royale since the beginning, no issues. This game I had lag in just about every game Im in. 
---
The other guy already did crow, but your video is superior. I'd like to see your version of crow.
---
So in other words... Darryl needs a buff?
---
They've attempted to release new modes multiple times (the reason the game is dying is because the constant changes to items and basically throwing away characters by nerfing them useless) so you're saying a new character every other month isn't consistent enough? You're saying a new map is what the player base wants? The map gets reworked every year. (which the fan base asked for anyways)
---
There's over 80+ gods in the game already so new players have a huge selection to choose from.  
---
I've  played smite since season 2 and I have to be blunt when I say you must have never played it to not understand these simple facts. 
---
All cosmetics were pushed for because of such a growing community/fan base and the more people in the fan base the more good artist and designers came along to help with the ever growing project. 
---
The many game modes the the community even assist make flopped because people continued to enjoy the old content more which tends to happen a lot (just look at team deathmatch on call of duty)
---
Its a skin for Leon the legendary brawler
---
Golden flair for this guy please he's so awesome we need more of himmm
---
You should credit the original artist, especially when all you did was put it through some filters
---
When I auto aim spam I constantly miss unless I’m point blank range
---
Teamer &gt;:(
---
Go for it, if someone stoles it just tell everyone and they will for sure notice. You can also try putting a watermark on them picture.
---
BRO I WOULD HAVE GIVEN GOLD IF I HAD ! LOVEEEEEEEEEEE U
---
It aint hard to push bo on that map just have to be aware of tanks and just team but i guess that the only way to push bo 
---
Noted
---
Bo pls😋

Looks dope

contact my author, u/solodas to rant about how you hate this bot and how it should be banned.
---
It’s called life leech, it’s a special game mode like the energy drinks and mushrooms
---
Fluffbutt. Or toebean
---
can you please tell me the odds of getting a legendary now that you got 4 brawlers , i really wanna know , just go to the shop and be like buying a big box you'll see ( i ) above it , click on it and there's a percentage by legendary brawler
---
Lol i feel bad for you, i got my first legendary at 0.25 so i guess you will get one soon too!
---
Yeah, if you play solo is impossible, ypu can be the best brawler in the game, 6 teamers will completely destroy you. 
---
They said "they liked that teaming existed as an strategy" but "hated organized teaming". That's why they removed the ability to see names of the opponents in SD. Before you could see them, and if he was a friend, you teamed and even used Discord lol
---
I am talking about trophies. People have suggested it since day 1, and it would help. One kill=one more trophy. People would be more aggresive and would betray more
---
While that happens, do what most people here (including me) do. Team with them, and betray them
---
Okay thx !
---
What can I say
---
Penny yes, Jessie no.
---
I’m missing mortis and spike
---
Crow isn't really in a bad spot right now. He's not bad, Spike and Leon are just so good right now they make Crow look like shit.
---
That was brilliant. That Bull must have had the fright of his life. 
---
keep in mind that the chances decrease with every new brawler

Yeah, after reaching 500 trophies (rank 20) it decrease very fast !
---
It was a fanmade idea

I learned about it only today :|
---
It is not a bug. Look at the gamemode, it has life leech modifier, you are losing health, and you gain it doing damage.
---
I’m not crying, _you’re_ crying!
---
Removed - This is an English speaking subreddit, characters not in the English language have been detected in your title. This may have been caused by emojis.
---
I'm pretty positive there are other games that did this concept first but games like Smite and Fortnite made them known
---
Ah thanks for the info. Sucks that this is what it has to be :/
---
In the up left corner u can see that its barley haha
---
For eveybody. Supers don't charge with x damage, they charge with x hits. 
---
For example, Brock needs 4 hits! Hope this is useful
---
It felt so good everytime I was the star player with him. Showing the people he isn't useless, he just has a high skill cap.
---
His big box contained Leon guys.
---
Crazy to think that someone got 1k trophies on mortis...
---
The problem is, that i can't have the code of the game.
---
The game mode is call life leech for a reason...

Una traduzione davvero "diludente".
---
Makes sense, but that seems kind of silly still. 33%? It takes 4 hits and % doesn't carry over, why not just make it 25% so it's a bit less obnoxious to be that close. 
---
When you get so close isnt it better and faster to just tap the shoot button instead of aiming it?
---
Goosebumps
---
I've actually posted about this as well. Would be a cool idea but it'd have to reset when you log in you don't set it and forget it. 
---
Oh wait, does he mean the Power 9 perk? I thought he meant damage dealt from Supers. Disregard!
---
Idk maybe you just care to much? Get together a good team of three and it’s easy to win, so maybe you will lose the stress factor?
---
Yes, it would be nice if there was a skin of soldier dress or similar to the rambo
---
Thanks dude :D
---
Wow! I love these guides! I haven't played Darryl yet, I'll give it a try now, Wish me good luck 😋
---
You aren’t going to get another brawler until the end of time
---
Gg
---
NICE VID!!! I feel myself really got something from the video

That's why I feel it would be better if they learn to bush camp less. Pretty sure it's only since global we see posts of 300+ bulls/primos/shelly players who 'mains' such brawlers. Those players will not learn the proper ways of playing the game in 3v3 and eventually we are the ones who suffer when we eventually match with these idiots. My idea is to lessen bush camping or hopefully make it less prevalent. Also it makes maps such as Island Invasion/Feast of Famine/Cavern Churn less cancerous whereby people just camp in the middle. Of course my idea isn't perfect but feel free to let me know what you think. 
---
It was fanmade 
---
I have only been playing since global release and a week ago got spike now I’m at 2.4k trophies.
---
I think you mean Shelly? 
---
Ti insegnerò come in englese va be? Perché sono meglio in englese
---
Bye bye Barley and Dynamike. Hello Wall Breaker
---
Sisi va bene, pensavo fossi inglese
---
And white crow is level 10 hitman
---
There was no space in the screen😭
---
Fantastic guide!
---
I mean yeah we do suffer, those mainers are EVERYWHERE. But I take advantage of it and always go for a team to wreck some idiots like those and teach 'em a lesson. It needs to stop but I don't think bushes should be touched.
---
I wish i was you. After the first week i had 19/22 now my progressbis extremly slow because my power points are much more spread out
---
Bull?
---
I didnt even know there was titles in brawl stars lmao
---
2 randoms -&gt; 4 randoms
---
Almost all my brawlers are level 15. But it still sucks for me not having even an epic. The free Mega box once you hit 4K didn’t give me anything 
---
Pls Supercell, 2k trophs, and just 2 no comun brawlers LOL ... sad
---
The fact that they got to 1xx 4xx and 3xx with star power and your entire team got to 3xx without it means you guys should technically be more skilled than them since they got to higher trophies on a level advantage while you didn't. Balance that out you guys are actually technically more skilled than your opponent. So yes it is unfair that you matched with them since you completely outskill them. They should be the ones complaining not you
---
Just grind on SD easy trophies for crow honestly 
---
That's won winning winner
---
SUPERCELL I KNOW YOU'RE READING THIS, WE NEED YOUR FEEDBACK
---
Now if you put a brick wall around in the water to border any Darryl's from flying towards their deaths yeah this would be dope
---
Hopefully the Brawl team see this
---
Man I’m trying to do that with Leon but it’s sooo hard with all the teaming, and I really don’t want to team. SD is like a new game after 400
---
❤️
---
I’m an OB that played for 1 month, got 800 trophies, forgot about the game, then played it on global release 
---
Yw now g i v e  m e  l e o n
---
She actually *is* Jessies mother. It is confirmed by Supercell.
---
What kinda chest was that
---
Pam is Jessies mom. Maybe Colts too?
---
Lol, this is something new. How did it happen? Was the game normal?
---
I feel like a lot of the posts on this subreddit and the clash Royale subreddit are quite low effort like complaining about bull, showing everyone they got Leon, or matchmaking issues.
---
They’re all the same thing over and over and it’s really annoying not seeing the actual discussion posts.
---
How did you learn to draw like this? These are professional! Good Job! 
---
Once i get a disconnect symbol then i can be first or last dosnt matter at all; i dont gain any trophy and dont lose any. Ofc i win majority of my matches or getting in showdown close to first but always not getting trophy is Frustrating
---
Big box 
---
rip old Darryl
---
*He* ***WAS*** *broken in heist tho....*
---
I disagree because if it was then I believe the alternate skin with a hat would be underwhelming
---
He can use a Lute* not a lure that’s a fail
---
He is just a weaker bull lmao let these people talk
---
Thanks you’re so nice 
---
Thanks ^,^
---
I know what the parameters for matchmaking are I was pointing out that it was interesting seeing the levels were close still. Also no one knows the exact trophy parameters the system uses so being within 50 or so could be considered great. Anything below 200 trophies is pretty much dumpster ranks anyways and there was really only 1 polarized brawler in that matchmaking (the bull of 277). The rest seems well within reasonable, check some other posts and content where the difference has been 200-300+ and you'll realize you actually had a pretty solid matchup.
---
Oh god this overwatch xD (only Paladins) 
---
Its not bad idea at all but this will Showing only at teams modes like gem grab and also you can skip it if you don't want to watch
---
Do you know what sarcasm is 🤔
---
We out here healin'
---
No he said that the time counts up and not down
---
Are all your brawlers maxes?
---
Do you know why or have a link to where they said that ?
---
That’s because you aren’t purchasing box’s. You need to open mega box’s to increase your chance. It’s a pity meter.
---
As in; people who spend a solid amount of money get a higher %. 
---
So people who spend trying to unlock get a little advantage. Even still, it’s not a crazy advantage.  
---
My .27% versus the usual .04% is basically the same. Extremely low hah 
---
Yeah that’s what I was thinking too ! 
---
Thank you finally an answer 
---
He didint say that anywhere.... he said that he has got 13 seconds and knows ppl that have gotten lower.... 12 seconds 11 seconds FROM THE START.
---
Lmao, skeletons 4 lyfe. No skeleton should be BONEly
---
They will re make all old models
---
Do you?
---
nope, I played games on my mini account and the enemy difficulty increases so that's totally untrue
---
She doesn't do very much damage at range, so you can just keep backing up while shooting her. Works for basically any non close range brawler.
---
But In showdown I was thinking it could work , it’s not always going to be your plays . One of your opponents could have gotten a 4 kill piece and it would show that!
---
i believe it was on the last brawl talk or the one before that, im not 100% sure but they did say it somewhere.
---
which jojo part is this?
---
I played some games as a mortis and i won XD
---
Ни памаку
---
I saw almost same idea but it was named doug the miner 
---
I'm pretty sure if you click play again, matchmaking will have a chance to match you with people from your own club and your friend list, but if you exit and queue again it won't. 
---
np
---
No I only have one maxed brawler
---
Lies
---
My idea is to complete different tasks to gain points and unlock some rewards.
---
Tasks should vary and once one is completed and points received a new one appears.
---
I choosed random numbers just for example, imo it should be pretty high amounts since it's quests for the whole band to complete but not too high so even the lower trophy range bands would be able to get some rewards
---
(Sorry for my terrible editing skills and grammar mistakes)
---
at high trophies they team with each other. and shelly is the best showdown player at any trophy level 
---
Kewl
---
This is the same people who run in with 8 gems using their super before I can charge my super
---
Conclusions: he would act like a thrower, with a high skill cap. Gem carrier or support. His wall can be used for many things: if you are chasing someone, placing the wall on them prevents them from escaping. If someone is chasing you you can place the wall on yourself to turn back on them, using the improved basic attacks. Using another wall or water, you can completely prevent someone from moving. And in brawl ball, you can change the ball's directions using the wall. 
---
:(
---
No cotton? 
---
Then stop running into the team with all the gems
---
Thats weird. Only the visuals matched? I honestly didn't copy a single aspect from this. 
---
Yeah I was just wondering if anyone had an explanation.
---
Does that affect my odds of getting brawlers or something?
---
Haha well played
---
Did you just protect your Shelly’s identity
---
NO. I MUST BE STAR PLAYER.
---
Let's be honest, everyone abandons Shelly when they get a good brawler
---
Oh that does make sense 
---
F
---
Are you f2p or not?
---
lol, it's not a bug, it's the new showdown mode, it happens to everyone
---
But my super isn't charge D:
---
How dare you
---
Yep. That’s the game mode. You gradually take damage as time passes. You can only heal by inflicting damage to others.
---
Omg it hurts! 
---
TOO BAD. I'LL USE MINE! *misses*
---
maybe coincidence but still very good concept
---
no, because i have good wifi
---
What do you consider low?
---
Didn't even know there were category names and been playing for a year :p
---
Thx 😁
---
Oh no, Jessie got the gems and hid a sentry at spawn. Now she's hiding in the bush! 
---
Yeah.. It would just be nice to see some sort of change to SD, instead of just the shotgunners ):
---
Doesn't really matter. Big Box is available to f2p. 
---
That’s how Mafia works
---
bull can do anything
---
I hate the way he runs it makes me feel like I'm lagging sometimes.
---
HellBull
---
below 380 is where you get bad players 
---
that’s the meta, it will change when supercell updates the game and chooses if they want to change that. 
---
What? 
---
El Primo is not even that good. Grind a bit for Bull if you have to, El Primo is weak. It was very hard for me to even get him to rank 10.
---
If I am not wrong, when a brawler have enough points to level up till lvl9, boxes stop giving points for that brawler.
---
You can just ignore those posts and look at the good stuff 😁
---
Bull’s paradise 
---
I like it xD
---
This is it chief 
---
Not that bad but showdown maps like cavern churn are quite bad for him,also some heist maps where you have only thin passage are making his super useless because you cant slip through them invisible or not, for example banditstash
---
hmm idk about leon doe, dmg nerf ofc, but what about his range? does it need a small nerf? 
---
Good meme but I mean...9 years are probably browsing this sub bug oh well haha.
---
What if you turned into the bear when you used your special, almost like a tank buff for Nita?
---
Maybe you should take into consideration that 106 gems is the correct amount, because the cost is based off of the first coin pack (150 coins for 20 gems) because the other 2 are on a discount and are more value. Supercell just counts the no discount one and that's it. 
---
This is actually very helpful. I'll make sure to try him out. Thanks!
---
Hmm ok then excuse me
---
Riiiight it’s not like every single supercell game has competitive tournaments they advertise on the actual game in the news section. Most of their income comes from people mass purchasing gems to play in the top tiers quickly. Clash royale was extremely competitive and had tens of thousands of dollar rewards for winners. They have always pushed competitive play, and continue to do so. I have no idea where you got the idea hey don’t care about competitive play from. 
---
Yes you're probably right now that I think about it, maybe I should remove it ?
---
*^(Sorry 820 for the picky ones)*
---
Other than the obvious need for a Leon nerf, I'm gonna press x to doubt the rest. 
---
Bo is fine as is, we don't need the devs ruining him with some trash remodel like they did with the others. He doesn't need a voice either.
---
Darryl, Crow, &amp; Mortis could maybe use a very slight buff. Most people's trouble with them is just that they don't know how to use them.
---
Leon does not need a buff in any capacity. Even with the nerf his super already received it's still pretty OP.
---
Devs need to be focusing on NEW CONTENT. What we need is more brawlers.
---
Why is Nita s? 
---
Showdown solo big bug. I was playing showdown and got hitted by crow. Every game i play now i keep getting the 108 damage some how i got it on video aswell 
---
Lost some points because off this shit
---
Using Android 
---
Welp. I have exactly 1,006 trophies and don't have Leon. Time to grind!
---
Report for hacking,
---
I hate these lucky guys
---
Seems to be that. Just got confused by the time when I first saw it and thought it funny. But I think you're right. ;V
---
Bro this is soooo cool!!!
---
It probably took you a lot of time to do lol.
---
I don’t know, I mean if you get complains maybe? Like I don’t wanna be that guy that tells you to remove the post but I’m also that guy who wants to be on the safer side and not let the children see stuff they shouldn’t see if you know what I’m sayin’?
---
Confused, how would blind people be able to read this using Braille ? 
---
I don’t understand why darryl needs buff. I have him at 560 trophies easy. Great as an assassin. People just don’t know how to play him. 
---
*someone* doesn't play Brawl Stars, cuz shelly's range is way smaller than ricos lol
---
Great game mode, makes for a lot more action and faster games! 
---
Yeah, it took me time to realize
---
I had to go afk and the bot got me to rank 1 (tho u don’t get trophies for it)
---
Fan art
---
Some weeks ago I played with a primo in rr having no idea of what his intention was. Like I dunno having some tea time or afk spot over there? 😂🤔☕
---
No barley  last damaged  me(piper) 
---
His health is way too high for his damage output and for the fact I think he's supposed to be a sniper. Also his ulty seems really bad, it goes to the nearest enemy? Which means in SD it would hit boxes which would neg me out since from what I know there is no distinction between enemy and damagable item. 
---
I sit in the middle of buffing Darryl. I disagree on how most want to buff him tho.  I don't think he needs a damage buff. I'd rather see his spread be decreased than an actual damage buff, but I don't think this is what they should do.
---
Most people who want him buffed seem to like playing him as a heavyweight instead of an ambush assassin. As a heavyweight, it feels like every other heavyweight does one of his things but does them better. The best way to set him apart in my opinion would be to buff his regular movemnt speed.  Doing this would also cause his strafe shot to be more narrow and in turn "increase" his damage when you are not point blank. 
---
They should just give each of crows daggers more damage and reduce the poison to like 10 damage, so that healing is still stopped but you don‘t lose as often because someone has ~100 health left and dies in 2 poison ticks after you‘re already gone.
---
I also think Darryl needs a buff and poco needs a guitar redesign
---
I totally agree 
---
Spike sustains himself using photosynthesis.
---
Whatever dude I contribute plenty of positivity here I’m gonna shit on a weak meme if I see one, you can down vote me and move on too. ✌️
---
I think that arm is extremely long. But nice work
---
Sorry, I just thought it was cool. I didn't mean to offend anyone. I mean, the credit can be seen if you click on their post, I thought that was ok
---
this is a well made map, ranged brawlers would definitely excel
---
thank you. i’ve seen so many posts about people complaining 
---
Stop using auto aim then.....and life leech is good, makes you actually do something instead of camping bushes for the entire match.
---
Are you a new global kid?
---
What kind of question if that rico fires more shots plus the damage on rico increases with every bounce
---
Join Darryl cult. Not big at all but still. If you want to join go ahead!
---
Maybe chili a bit?
---
Okay, but anyone could take someone else's artwork and call it a new brawler. I do agree that it would be cool to have some kind of volcano brawler, though.
---
ahem allow me r/woooosh
---
no, but I'm pretty sure a sd map is dropping next week
---
Sa... Nevermind
---
Thanks! I spent a while editing it, but it was surprisingly easy. iMovie all on iPhone 7, just exported it to PC and added audio then.
---
Yeee. Off a regular box, wasn’t expecting it at all. I got 0 epics and 0 mythicals, so I was expecting one of those. 
---
Agree, some players, like me, who played a lot of Brawl Stars, having these kinds of modes are fun, adds more colours to the game
---
But please it’s dancing * there’s no e 
---
nice! you should make a YT channel for this
---
Mortis: S tier in brawl ball, F tier in every other game mode
---
this is the one showdown mode where nobody teams
---
You see it in brawl ball
---
Hello Nader, nice comment
---
Sorry, my english is not my mother language. Thanks for the correction by the way
---
I guess you're right, so, I won't post anything like that again. And yeah! Super cool
---
What it does!!!!!
---
And no bo buff srsly?
---
Just right know there was one player who just stood and shot.
---
I can he just made something to push every 2-3 seconds.
---
Need a report button! 
---
*bow
---
Piper getting piped! 
---
I'm going to assume you're not playing against any motis that are above 400 trophies. There are really really good players who play mortis.
---
ive never seen anyone team on it even at &gt;500
---
It’s alright man my bad haha :)
---
Yeah same here
---
You are just a boss bro!!!
---
It a Furry
---
Thank you, kind anonym sir of the internet
