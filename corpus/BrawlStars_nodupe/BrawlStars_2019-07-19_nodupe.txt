Has piper been cheating on Rico?

2d option very nice idear!

But he’s a robot, he can’t
---
I smell dyna over here
---
*Insert joke about Chara Here* Just Kidding lol, this Art is so cute
---
It would love this.  It would make buying brawlers more fun.  The only downside of buying brawlers is the lack of satisfaction, but this would fix that!
---
Cool
---
Oh, that's cool.
---
Yes R.I.P
---
Blursed
---
Then you are a dumbass my friend Jajaja, too bad this is your Best play
---
It looks like swampert
---
This can go with any super that destroys obstacles. For example, Shelly’s super :D
---
Piper always has his eyes closed in game, but in his icon she has only one eye open
---
Tara would be the uno reverse card one lmao
---
In terms of how hard it is to programme.... 
---

---
Of course they could assign a refund code to each individual skin but that will be very long 
---
Or creating a new paragraph of codes to make a new variable 
---
And then a new paragraph for the refund button 
---
Then actually initiating the code to the skins 
---
Then actually programming how the variable changes 
---
Then having to state the number of gems of all skins to the variable 
---
Then having the whole refund option 
---
So...
---
yes, but with bandaid shellys hes not viable
---
To protect the world from devastation

I’m a globalist and I approve. Can I flex my 15K trophies after the purge and say I care as much as a beta player? (I know it’s not super high anymore but I play with tops often enough I feel important xD)

I've noticed a few of those things such as "being pinned" or being halted while moving or firing. Half of my brawlers are 500 plus so when it happens I watch the replay...it usually doesnt show the event during the replay. It also odd that I can go on a multi game win streak but soon as I'm about to rank up I lose many many trophies in a row...I dont change the way I play so maybe it's just coincidence..or maybe its not.
---
Honestly though...

Can you please do something for leon? Please please please please
---
Not power level 4 I'm disappointed

I have no idea how it happened, my teammate tried to have 2 of the same brawlers but this happened instead

I know, I’m bad

He looks like a type of morty tbh

Where have I seen this before

Or the fact that you have 666 trophies...

Fair enough

Wow! Thanks for idea!

Finally someone gets it
---
I miss ricochet
---
I appreciate the effort, but it's just not interesting to me
---
Not bad for your first time
---
If you got 10.5k trophies in under 9 months, yes it’s normal to not get a legendary in that time period.
---
but... carl

And don't have leon skin

U did a cringe

imagine if he had a star power that worked like the cloak and dagger

Stop

Lol why dont i have any legendarys

Main attack: fires two explosive bolts that fly out at the same time, in a V shape. Each one deals 945 damage at max power.
---
Super: M0w-H4wk comes from the sky, and drops bombs on the nearest target anywhere on the field, dealing 1500 damage with each bomb. Drops 3 bombs before it flies off back to the skies. M0w-H4wk's firing rate is comparable to Penny's mortar, and will change targets with each drop if they're in a 5 tile radius of a new foe.
---
Star Power 1- Divebomb- M0w-H4wk now divebombs opponents before taking off to the sky, dealing 1200 damage to the nearest target. 
---
Star Power 2- Birds of Prey- Connie can see foes in bushes when they're under M0w-H4wk, up to 3 tiles in radius.
---
Nah its becuse he wants a legendary in his 1 brawl box he just got
---
the funny thing is that this content it's doomed to be reposted.
---
&gt;You have become the very thing you swore to destroy!
---
I don’t feel ur pain I don’t have Leon but it’s gotten to the point where I never prioritize a leon since ur not very scary anymore ngl
---
Mortis just wants to eat dynamike he doesn’t give a crap about the thumbnail
---
Still not a valid reason to make a new post that is practically identical to mine.You could show mine but nah, of course not.

Oh ok I was thinking of pokemon that have a cannon or something like her turret

---
Nah man. Rico means Rich... Not many people have that name at all...
---
Its epic already
---
More like when Frank uses his super on you
---
Maybe robo mike means that the bird normally is pulling a ratatouille and using dynamike’s hair to move him
---
ikr
---
mohamedpro is somewhere too
---
Mortis is a real name
---
underrated post
---
I think it's lwarb beta search up on chrome and install
---
They should atleast test it. I would say a decent chunk of people only play on days with brawl ball, and so making brawl ball everyday would retain it's playerbase.
---
But... wouldn’t it affect your legendary chance that way?
---
Heh.. I'm used to it, but thanks for noticing me :)
---
It was a screenshot of another reddit post 😶
---
This is a stolen post my dude
---
I want the ping idea so bad even tho there are only to types of ping in the game. bad and decent

I actually saw your post saying that it was stolen, and then downvoting instantly when I saw it

didnt know mortis was trans that's pretty cool

Uh.. I've seen it. But shouldn't we leave the source?

K i'm sry
---
I did this since Piper’s super has many flaws to it, I’ll add a comment soon explaining
---
Not restaurant Leon but resPECt Leon.
---
😂
---
This is a starpower idea I came up with to fix Piper’s super. Due to how slow her super is and how predictable it is, it’s really easy to just watch her super, and go to the spot she lands at before she lands there. 
---
By slowing down her enemies when they get hit by the grenades, it prevents enemies from constantly chasing her non stop and gives her an opportunity to run away. The speed boost she gets after landing is to counter the people who walk to the spot she lands at before she lands there. This way she can at least get a better chance of running away.
---
Wut?Brock is an uncommon name?
---
Let me get my "terraria refference on random subreddits list" check
---
r/Brawlstars ✅
---
I like the speed boosted idea after landing that would certainly be an improvement.

Wait that’s illegal

Lmao then don't go on the internet cuz ur gonna have a bad time

Whaaaat! There are ppl calling mecha crow ugly?? Are they okay?? How did mecha crow become ugly in their eyes. Mecha crow is so beautiful!!!
---
There should have been a tear, poor guy!
---
Ikr?!
---
Why do people use us throwers as a face for teaming? It happens more often with others I see pam a shellys colts pipers crows all of them doing the same.
---
Yes yes! I like it so much too bc it reminds me of gundam. I played gundam when i was younger💜
---
Yes!!!
---
Is Leon going into Area 51 to find his new skin that he never got????
---
This looks interesting...good job!🔥
---
Um what?

I miss playing terraria :(
---
Why are u even searching that?
---
This is a repost
---
Level 231 at 7k? He’s either really bad or trolls a lot

Doesn’t this count as advertising or does it not cause you didn’t say subscribe? Anyway I’m not complaining because I need ‘support’ getting to 100.
---
His star powers are ok though?
---
I feel like Carl is the guy who would use his pickaxe to break the candy.

I’ve noticed that too. It’s bothered me since.

In all seriousness, how has this game not been taken down due to copyright? Who cares if they made it “original” by feline-ifying it, it’s still a blatant rip off. It’s has been out for so long

im kinda sad that supercell got rid of the option to try skins, like phoenix crow, because i used to always try it in training cave, because it looks so cool, but not i can't do that any more :(
---
Not outstandingly short. Happens sometimes but still cool
---
i haven't unlocked any star powers since last update.....

Buy them all

Do you know what the game is called?

OK

And make it double!

Don’t buy him, I purchased the skin and I don’t even have the option to use him. I feel like I wasted 300 gems. Doesn’t make much sense why I can use him. What a waste.

Then please leave the subreddit

Its really Bad. I'm almost certain the implemented some kind of cap. Iam waiting for about 10 stars. I didn't get any since months. Then when major update hits I get always like 3 stars out of 20 boxes. WTF

I am trying to say jumping with mike is not easy as killing them with barley barley is better at long range too it is easier to hit shots and they nearly deal the same damage

Did you try reporting him
---
Supercell can sometimes be such a bitch
---
What do you mean
---
Wait, so if one brawler reaches 400, you can watch all of the replays?
---
One of the reasons they reworked it is so you get replays faster.
---
Just because someone is new to the game doesn't mean they can't have replay worthy moments.
---
You can just record the game while playing.

---
They must let you buy boxes with star point. In the same proportion there was before. Until this won't be possible, it isn't fair. 
---
They could give star point basing on 300 trophies and let the end season reset on 500, with no modify in trophies system
---
Salut

Great job tho

No. Only games where at least one players current brawler is at 400

Tip : dont die

Pretty off considering you're a time traveler dumbass
---
yeah but sharing a crazy montage is more impressive when you have proof that you played agaist good opponents within the 400 range or higher
---
No  problem
---
Kinda boring
---
But you have 6906 star points!

Because Leon has social anxiety, it’s also why he goes invisible

I would remove some of trees, 'cause in this configuration grass is pretty useless, his wideness make you predictable when you enter and much trees limit too much the movement to avood shots, I think. Maybe just half of tress, 'cause you could enter in the grass and avoid shots more easily.

I can't be the only one a little annoyed at how at the top part all the commas are replaced with full stops and the full stops are replaced with commas

Forgot about how painful expert was. If need be, protect your jungle with hallow, as hallow doesn’t destroy it while crimson/corruption does. Also don’t forget to brew tons of potions. It’s tedious but so, so worth it
---
very very satisfying

Of course it a Chrono Pierce post. You are awesome my friend

Why does everyone think no one is one word?

Yeah, this is big brain time

Should be 13.5k to unlock replays. 27 x 500 = 13.5k.

Mortis is actually good against Bibi because of her attack delay

Oh damn

Thats vice city
---
I can almost hear this idiot's teammates swear.
---
The ofc you only have 18 brawlers!  It’s a new account!  You’re getting so many trophies without any reward!
---
The craziest moments happen at mid or low trophies. Since ppl make a lot of mistakes there's a huge potencial for outplay
---
My god. Not even maxed Rosa with her super could survive a single shot
---
Leon can win against shellys if they don't have their super, actually.
---
not rico, only kairos thinks that
---
It's really because you did not make enough purchases in the game so they banned you.
---
What is this post? Not because it says "Brock" it means it is related to the game and you can post it here. Stop with these shitty posts
---
I may not have 15k trophies, but I was playing since canada ios beta and I also give approval... xD
---
This username just speaks for itself.
---
No

Night Mecha Crow or loaded Rico

I think you have it worse when you play crow and then switch to piper I remember jumping into someone and just waiting for her slow landing until I died
---
I have one: Uninstall this game

(finally an original post)
---
nope

This should have more upvotes.

I appreciate that it's your own idea , but this has already been done . Not a REPOST

Same here, I only have Morris. I’m at 5k.
---
Yep

the black + hot pink oke is nice
---
Never even thought of that. But robo bo is interesting in some ways though.
---
Is there live footage and where could I find it
---
Yes that's what they're planning 
---
Star points will get improved
---
especially? without it she's the weakest brawler in the game, and even with it, she's only good against close range brawlers, rico still shreds her
---
Brawl Stars at 3:00 a.m

Kill me please :D

pretty much failed at the last sentence. band aid is not a little stronger in brawl ball. she's viable in every single game mode with band aid now. a-s tier too

---
Hahah! Communism rocks!
---
But that's where they post update patch note and news and stuff so they just want you to get fast and accurate news
---
I'll take it all
---
Do Shelly this way. I think it would be very cool
---
Since it’s run by memes mostly, not ideas
---
hey hey eho knows if they encounter any of those mikes from fujisan
---
Yeah I could change that
---
Heist is my favorite mode besides solo showdown
---
Thank you. Again saying, im sorry that someone already made a similar version, I really REALLY didnt knoe :(
---
Let's go practize medizine.
---
basically it's the king of most showdown maps
---
how do u get battle log in brawl stats
---
I push my Poco in solo showdown and he's amazing lol
---
I think they just did it for the rhymes for some reason. Mecha crOW and bO and robo spIKE and mIKE
---
I’m not a pro. But I’m top 50 United States. I can say unequivocally that this is the absolute worst crap in the game. Mains like this are almost always complete garbage. They bring their “favorite” regardless of whether they’re viable on a map or mode. Worse than teamers. Worse than people who throw games.
---
I hope lol
---
Gosh how Lucky are u
---
But the thing is I would just switch between the 2 and I also like the blue mecha crow
---
Time to hunt some content stealers
---
You autoaim with Jessie?
---
Same..i mostly do sd because i'm not totally good at 3v3
---
I would beat some Brocks with that skin
---
Don't get it.
---
Meh, just matters how much you personally like them. Poco, rico, mortis and tara are my four favorites.
---
He's very map dependent, on his best maps, there are no equals.

Bruh, there was just a video making fun of reposts, please delete your account

Very very very bad

Poor power 2 bull😅😂

I don’t get it

Why is this NSFW?

Hey! It's a great idea! Some of them are too op but they deifinitly sound fun (btw I'm 14 too *virtual high five*)
---
Quality 👍
---
Well I mean it’s not a fact that can be copied since most people know about it, although I understand you, it’s not really something needed to be credited

Maybe a 30-50% damage reduction to older supers

Funny, because you have a post about how youd react when somebody steals art but then dont realise that somebody stole that painting.
---
Good idea!

It's a joke about rico x piper
---
Give me BEEBS
---
I love the detail in this, and how you color coded the brawlers. The ideas are also good too and make sense. We need more posts like this 😁
---
Sans Tick Undertale
---
They go in the center for die and lose all the gems
---
Brawl stats for brawl stars its a application to show the best brawlers for each map and mode and that recomendations are made by KairosTime 
---
Alright i think i sound like a robot or something
---
You can actually moderate youtube comment section, but hardly anyone does it.
---
But I don't think supercell will really add it as it may cause delays in moving your brawler. You might even have to stop your brawler to text pass and the enemy might know that your either lagging or asking for passing the ball
---
Happy 🍰 day!
---
Some of these are way too op although nice ideas
---
Jessie’s would be kinda useless, don’t you think?
---
It is so nice
---
I got my first Legendary at 7k before trophy inflation :(
---
Balls of fire? Scales? Smaller dragons?  
---
But for real since I assume this is based off inferno dragon from Clash Royale, I would think he would shoot fireballs.
---
Piper is good at retreiving bolts in siege? What, she should be the farthest away from them and abuse her range, but her only real good mode is Bounty.
---
And Tara wipes out a whole team with ease? You rarely ever get a 3 man ult, usually you use it on 1 person to win your lane and pressure mid.
---
Mortis isn’t good at all vs the meta which comprises of a lot of bandaid shelly and bibi/rosas

Really?

This art was Made by him, stupid Bird
---
Maybe just a button?
---
Is for box spawn reference, i know that is a LOT of boxes in one place (sorry for  misspellings inglish is not my first language)
---
Fun fact, Poco’s 3rd star power idea you just made was actually the original star power for him before they changed it
---
well i am not good at 3v3 too but i hate matching with bad randoms , afks . 2 of those 9 loses was because afk teammate . 4 was because bad teammates who rush for the first bolt and then die and once they die we lose field control and then we lose. and matching with randoms that are playing with bad brawlers for the map or the mode is so frustrating. like why would u play rico instead of colt on a map with no walls? so dumb
---
They also consult with top players tho. Rey brought in a pro player who chose the rankings himsefl
---
You are not right dude......
---
Poco and Tara have a very slow reload speed, you must have skills to not waste them. Jessie is actually very good
---
*iT'S a TRaP*
---
Gene’s can be used in a troll way lol
---
how do you know that? is there an order
---
Piper "amazing" in heist? What? Definitely not, not even before her best map was removed.
---
I want replays at zero trophies and I'm at 10.5k
---
http://imgur.com/a/L3CU4v6
---
I agree too
---
*cries in F2P*
---
I thought it was Crow
---
I like the Gene one. Nice idea!!
---
The Bo mines drop randomly in the super radius. Most of the time they hit.
---
when i look at poco i think of coco 
---
when i look at this art i think: this poco is outta coco
---
i love this
---
I gotta ask you, what is the point of spinning if the enemy team doesn’t know you’re spinning? It’s like teabagging in a single player game. If nobody on the enemy team sees you BMing, then did you really BM?
---
They should change it to 500 since they changed the trophy system
---
hmm...i thought there were less. nvm!
---
* even mo r e coughs* hot p o I n t * coughidy cough *

No problem. I fixed it because it didn't have the spawns :)

And also add a bunch of 1 space tiles! Would be awesome.
---
Yooooo

lol, I did this once, I just destroyed the enemy team, scored a goal and my teammates scored on my own goal 😢
---
cancer
---
Omg!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
r/Darrylgang
---
I know but the fact that this is possible is still something to think about when trowing them
---
I’m gonna elaborate a bit more instead of just sounding like an angry dick.
---
First, as I said, there is no brawler who is a seriously good choice for every map and every mode. Rico is amazing on some maps. Others, he’s just a sitting duck waiting to be killed. Bring Rico to snake prairie and see how often you win(hint: not often)
---
Second, maining means you get little to to no experience with other brawlers. Why is this bad? Because playing other brawlers helps you learn their mechanics. You learn how fast a super charges, how theirs shots work, who they can counter and who they have a hard time against. Why is this important? Knowing a brawler helps you tremendously in countering that brawler when you play against them. Brock and piper function very similarly but their shot speed and reload speeds are different. Knowing how to react to either is important.
---
If you’re maining for star tokens, bad decision too. You would need 1700 trophies in a season to get the same amount of star tokens you’d get from ranking one brawler up to 20. Pushing relatively evenly is literally more rewarding. And it will make you better at the game, which will make the game far more fun.
---
AND 1.2K upvotes! MuSicAL mayHeM

Am I missing something or what do you mean? shelly's super doesn't do 25k damage.

And I was right

I bought some boxes in the past and got nothing as well. I am sure the luck will struck you some times :-)

*Wait that's illegal.*

how do you do this in friendly match?

For you its yes :)

It's a joke about how strong shellys super is

You copied a photo from Google or something

Makes no sense if you were in a lobby with people feeding you.

Some of the star powers are super op

Why you would want to buy brocks SP with gems? It is not worthy you can buy it with gold or waiting to get it in a brawl box. This is actually a pretty good offer
---
Thanks for viewing. comment who I should Draw next!

My friend got Leon the second week of playing. It’s been like 4 months now for both of us and I just got crow the other week. I started at .14 for legendary, and after opening god knows how many boxes my percentage went up to .26 and I just got crow last week.
---
r/im14andthisiswoooosh

Agreed
---
This isn't brock.

The Mortis one sucks, you cant kill them if you push them away, gives you a disadvantage

Don't know what to say. You have to collect them I guess

If they both don’t have their super and meet point blank with all their ammo, Bull wins because he can get  more dps than Shelly. Otherwise, if there’s a bit of space between, Shelley’s super is somewhat charged, or something like that, Shelley wins

working on rick rico and tick
---
No it’s very low I had 0.24 one time
---
Creative Idea!
---
I can understand the confusion since this seems to be some kind of custom game where 1 score wins.
---
Thank you!😊
---
Thanks!😊
---
Well it was definitely above .2 is all I can tell you. The amount I played was a range. I have everyone except spike and Leon and gene.
---
Very creative and detailed. Nice work.
---
I think you can adjust some stats as follows to make it more balanced:
---
Spike: 100 hp heal per second instead of 30. He's squishy after all.
---
Nita: Just 20% or 25% super recharge, 50% is too op.
---
Primo: He can basically keep attacking with his fast reload speed. I suppose this SP would be very op. I don't know how to make it balanced for now.
---
Rosa: +150 or +200 damage boost is good enough.
---
Barley: About 300 hp heal would be enough. He can regain 600 hp from each attack.
---
Darryl: 50% longer instead of 100%. 
---
Penny: I don't know if it means the travel speed of the ball or the frequency of the attack. If it's the former, then 10% or 15% faster will be very critical. 50% travel speed boost will make it a nightmare. If it means the fire rate, then I think 25% is ok.
---
Tick: I think a 0.5 sec boost will be good enough. Tick is already very good at controlling right now.
---
Tara: I don't know if it's 1.0 or 10 seconds. I hope it's the former.
---
Pam: It is easy for her to hit targets continuously. If the attack slows down an fleeing enemy, then it basically means that enemy is doomed for sure. I don't think it should be a slow down effect.
---
BiBi: I'm thinking maybe 1200 hp heal or somewhere near.
---
Frank: 25% attack animation speed will make a lot of difference. 40% probably will turn him into sickmode.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Fun fact, the SP for Carl you mentioned is actually an either scrapped 2nd SP or an intended 3rd SP for him. Some people found it in the game files. It allow Carl to destroy walls and bushes with his super.
---
Very well done, I loved it!
---
Sadly, I can't give a platinum, because I'm broke, but here's my upvote.
---
I really just don’t like playing piper and Rico, I don’t think they’re horrible I just don’t personally like playing them
---
These are some amazing ideas! It just needs more balancing so some of them aren’t completely overpowered. Maybe do Jessie’s where hitting her turret with the energy orb gives it a small hit speed boost for 2 seconds or something like that. 👍
---
Everything for the meme buddy

Nice.

Perphorm lmao
---
but you are annoying as fuck bc of me a leon main not beind able to heal
---
It’s “arriba”, cerdo insolente
---
These are super smart ideas, I bet you are doing good in high school rn
---
yeah but it's startling seeing how fast and how many that are being made by the hour
---
It depends on the map. If map has a lot of walls chose Rico. If map doesn't have that much walls chose Colt.
---
Stop already! It's infectiously, you know.

This is wholesome... XD

I am 5k and got 15 brawlers only
---
I’m confused but okay
---
The first part, increased range, is obviously a buff. Part 2 though, is only useful if enemies are standing still, so, 100% useless. It's twice as useless though, once you consider it is already possible to make Bo's arrows stay together instead of separating.
---
I obviously know you can choose star powers, but every brawler's two (hopefully three later on) starpowers should be both equally useful, and which one you use should just depend on personal preference/map/team comp.
---
This is specially true in this case where the 3rd starpower is useless/shitty compared to Bo's other 2 starpowers which are both god-tier.
---
I. Didn't. Knew. About. It. Until. Now.
---
whats that in the top right corner?
---
That means i have to hunt all the Dynamikes and Barleys
---
Rename Nitas new star power to "Death Wish"
---
OOF
---
I forgot about the "idiot sandwich" insult, where Gordon puts someone's head in between 2 pieces of bread and calls them an idiot sandwich. One of my favorite one-liner jokes from him.
---
# MIND BLOWNED
---
I think Jessie’s could be a damage increase if she bounces it off her turret and have the bounce have increased velocity so it’s harder to dodge. Star powers are meant to incentivize a new play style generally
---
When tf did I call you a noob I can’t find it anywhere?
---
Then I’ll make peace with Colt Kind, and then the Bulls, and then whoever is next. This world can be filled with peace!!! (Also you forget the Ticks)
