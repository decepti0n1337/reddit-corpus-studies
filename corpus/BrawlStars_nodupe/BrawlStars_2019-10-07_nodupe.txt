Hmm wouldn‚Äôt it be great if when Darryl is in the starting area, instead of popping out and pointing his guns he hides away and makes himself look like a legit Jack-O-Lantern, glowing light and all? 
---

---
This is just food for thought tho, if the skin idea actually was implemented in gameü§î
---
Pam and 8-bit's turrets are implied with thew carpets.
---
Woah how did you make that
---
I small price to pay for salvation
---
makes sense XD
---
Make the credits bigger
---
ah
---
I posted one like 20 seconds earlier before yours, no offence
---
It's not true Gene main attack only hits 1 person
---
What‚Äôd they say
---
How bout Pam's healing station?
---
Watermark so no one would steal.
---
left is long range/bulls and the right side is... the right side ...
---
What‚Äôs kind of bot doesn‚Äôt beat hard
---
I think is enough big, the people when they see the icons, can see the credits
---
judging by the votes and how they remodeled tara and piper by those votes yes
---
Waht have u done!
---
Petition
---
I was going to do this but your idea of bibi stood out
---
Thanks for inspiration tho, I‚Äôll try and see if I can credit you somewhere if I finish rhis
---
Excuse me but I think you're **CoPyInG mE**
---
NP! üòÅ
---
Thank you :)
---
It can split and hit multiple at once
---
This spoke to me spiritually
---
But it‚Äôs hard to read
---
sandy: cries in the corne- oh nevermind he is too lazy to cry
---
Is enough if u zoom
---
Sorry for my bad English
---
I know but that's not the MAIN attack. It's the secondary attack
---
leon looks amazing
---
Tell me why
---
But I do have a question, I‚Äôm using KineMaster too, did you like individually put the words for the dialogue or is there an effect
---
YES
---
There's an effect for that
---
???
---
It‚Äôs part of the main attack. 
---
The ‚Äòsecondary attack‚Äô is the super.
---
Bo. You can see that you exploded first when you slow it down a bit
---
Clot looks so good. :)
---
Ah I see. Could have made a bigger implication with a pixel skull and the plus sign on the carpets
---
Good pixel art ;)
---
This post is so old bro..
---
They did already remodel to Tara El primo and Piper no matter what the survey said so it‚Äôs not relevant..
---
My wish that crow get remodel to all skins that are maid but it‚Äôs a lot of rework ..
---
No
---
It's not the main attack does 1400 damage at max and the secondary attack is comes when the main attack doesn't hit
---
Another tip. If you are fighting another Brawler and you are definitely going to die, accept it. Dont fight back. Unless you really need to build Super, dont. If you take them to low health, they could get killed right after you die, which means 2 people get points instead of just your attacker. 
---
It seems backwards, but it do be like that.
---
r/swapaccount
---
What‚Äôs the purple and blue thing in the back?
---
Big flex on people, especially me
---
If they do the better make white crow look better and Phoenix crow look god like, based on his price.
---
good bot
---
Nah it's still the main if you didn't know
---
With pixels
---
Oh, you shouldn't
---
Nice
---
How do u have a brawler that high at 12k? My highest is poco at 23 at 13k lmao congrats btw
---
High effort and underrated
---
Wut it do ticc my boi
---
Well sorry if i made you less happy, that wasnt my intention, you are a strong, independent, smart, and talented person who will do great things in your life. I hope i sounded like a mom, moms are underrated and motivational
---
Is it that big of a deal lmao
---
Like how it‚Äôs a bit funny, cute and dark all at the same time.
---
Who else is thirsty now?
---
what if u remove a party of 2??
---
yes and try to make sure the gem carrier doesnt die, as gem carrier never go into the middle without proper support
---
Same lol
---
I think it was because we were expecting ‚Äúpenny‚Äôs bunny‚Äù but really got ‚Äúbunny penny‚Äù
---
This is amazing
---
I live in US so I just watched videos about it and installed it the day it went global I didn‚Äôt know u could change your App Store location that easily lmao
---
PLEASE
---
What if u remove a teamate from a party of 2
---
True.
---
I don‚Äôt think anyone would copy a meme this shitty
---
F
---
Rosa: ok bye *leaves*
---
downvotes checks out
---
Thanks mom
---
You are the tara person right? The one who made the tara thing
---
Nobody cares
---
to be fair, to finish clash royale's trophy road you have to be one of the top players of the world, and i dont think clash of clans has a trophy road
---
If no body cares then why u comment
---
I am playing from Dec 12 i.e global realease
---
You made minecraft fused with brawlstars duh
---
You've successfully prove yourself a better player to a casual who only started to try pushing brawlers a month ago. Here have a upvote for your amazing accomplishment
---
Could be shown in map information really easily
---
ok but everyone remember they're siblings
---
How did you get 3 El primos
---
It‚Äôs... *beautiful*
---
Last sentence ruined the post
---
Cab you do a bulbaspike next
---
Even if I don't credit, crop the watermark, and claim the art is mine? ( Great art btw)(don't worry I'm not going to steal, I'm against it)
---
Can you do a tranquil crow
---
Why did I get Pam turret
---
Where is Spike sock, I am disappointed :(
---
(Jk really like this! &lt;3)
---
Damn he rich and got bitches
---
ok
---
This better get added to the game bro its so cool
---
hey JK reddit, i guess you probably know me, it was in the art thief nightmare BS. i literally got downvoted to -23 points just because i told him that his art was beautiful and i never knew that he stole the art. see and i literally could not post anything or even comment. so i had to start a new reddit account. hey btw, it is appreciatable that you help the starter but not on 3v3 pls as people have to suffer the lose of the match. hey but pls dont downvote, witch means then i have to get a new account. thx for understanding
---
Yoooooo
---
‚ÄúAn 8-bit who had Shelly‚Äù
---
Should have a star power to have a charge up (not that long) that allows her to shoot a bullet that does a decent amount of splash
---
on the bear
---
The rug
---
8 bits and Pam's turret are the rugs
---
The rug is her turret
---
I guess you're right, she's too weak on the range part considering her damage.
---
Me: sees Coach Cory's tier list
---
Thomas has never seen such bullshit before
---
I'm open for suggestions
---
DISCLAIMER, THIS IS NOT AN ANIMATION  (that may be coming out in the future)
---
THIS IS JUST ME AND MY DECENT BEGGINSERISH/MEDIOCRE EDITING SKILLS
---
with that out of the why,
---
- What should I replace bones and blue bones with
---
-Should I add voice lines?
---
-other suggestions welcome
---
My current thought process
---
-Poco dodges by hiding behind a wall
---
-at the end, poco dodges but the bibi super bounces back
---
-during sans mercy, maybe use still friends voiceline 
---
-gate blasters are banjos
---
Better yet, do rico with robo retreat xD
---
That's cute &lt;3
---
Because memes are funny and bring a light mood to the environment. ChronoPierce and GediKor aren't aggressive about the idea of "stealing art" until their art is stolen and that's why they have recognition in the community. I get that people don't want their art stolen but think about it, you can use that to your advantage and gain more popularity if this consistently happens. I've seen some skin ideas formatted similar to GediKor but guess what people just scroll through them and think how another one of GediKor's amazing work but the artist who actually made it gets overshadowed because that's what popularity does. 
---
Your art isn't bad but when you put "PLEASE DON'T REPOST W/O PERMISSION", "**insert tag**", and whackass titles that are supposed to be taken ironically like "ive been working on this for 2 days and **it clearly deserves 1000 downvotes**". Then you won't get any recognition and neither will your art grow because people are gonna find you annoying and your title deserving of r/titlegore . Those tags across the art also take away from it. If you want recognition you need to let art that gets stolen blow up and if they do then take credit otherwise just let them die in "new". The tags also provide the comment section with awkwardness. 
---
Also making art doesn't mean more karma.
---
Coco amirite
---
Idk I kinda based her off of Pam since they both are healers. Only you are the turret
---
When I get calls, my game lags so much
---
What i got from this post is u/Axen212 is missing 3 legendaries, he probably has 19k trophies
---
Personally, I think Poco is the worst, people say he‚Äôs great for brawl ball, yet he‚Äôs just another decent brawl ball brawler. Anything else, he‚Äôs terrible.
---
And why can't they just, yk, be their persona?
---
Maybe make her range like 4 and increase her damage to 620 per hit (at power 1)(868 at max) and make the star power increase her range by 20% instead of 100%?
---
Crow is more fun
---
I did get crow so sad
---
 btw I like spike more.. 
---
 better skins
---
I'm at 14k trophies, got spike at 3000 trophies when i din't have the primo, also, playing since android release, June 2018
---
also try and edit her hp so it works better with the game mechanics (each upgrade increases hp and attack by 5% and 5% of 4250 has a decimal and you cant have a brawler with 0.5 hp) so maybe increase it to 4600
---
Idk what i like more, the comic or the skin idea, its gotta be the comic. Amazing job
---
wonder if she needs help with the game, happy to teach her &gt;w&lt;
---
Yeah that sounds solid.
---
wat. its already good against tanks. ranged units have easier time dealing with it. if you are going to drop on top of a tank they yeah it's going to be destroyed quickly
---
Looks great but idk if supercell would ever collab with pokemon
---
This guy has done more than GediKor
---
Supercell copyrighting themselves
---
r/wholesomebrawlstars
---
Good luck with the other legies, love the idea too btw
---
yes sirr
---
Where i can find this faces with better quality?
---
I didn't know it worked like that :0 thanks
---
Congratulations!
---
haha very funny
---
Jessie torret?
---
I got spike but I wish I got crow since my friend already has spike and now we can‚Äôt play with our legendaries
---
Thanks!
---
It looks like one of those knock off toys
---
U/unitytm just epicly molested a dead horse
---
I‚Äôve wanted this for so long
---
that's cool dude i just epicly watched a video on r/watch people die
---
Well it‚Äôs kinda weird
---
no problem
---
Did you post this twice?
---
Those are homozygous alleles
---
With me damn primos team up
---
DISGUISE: 100
---
K
---
Yes, banana, I did. I can't find the way to hide it because you found it
---
I got my first epic (Pam) at 2500 trophies, so you‚Äôll get a epic soon! :)
---
Idk how I feel about abs on Crow. Looks cool tho!
---
his list is made considering that you will be facing a lot of 8bit piper(snappy sniping) and bibi(shield ) cause they are meta. that's why crow was low.
---
Medium box
---
nvm the post made a comeback
---
:)
---
Oh ok
---
Didn't lex have a rank 30 brawler?
---
The other one has feedback if you wanna read it
---
Ranked can go into 20 minutes easy. So many teams just camping into the final circle.
---
wait what do you mean by safety reasons
---
It doesn't work that wayü§¶
---
OH ... lol üôÑ that makes sense now
---
The turret talking "roger roger" (Droid B1) was pretty funny, the life and damage of 8 bits is balanced by its mobility
---
483 is only 18 trophies away from 501, not much difference
---
Pizz off!
---
Do you think some people would really do that? Just go on the internet and tell lies?
---
Broke the upvote button
---
Is another there
---
üòáüòÄ
---
There was a template like this a few months ago
---
He‚Äôs probably new to the game or just accidentally hit the Super Button he will get into the game sooner or later 
---
Stop bullying people on the internet you‚Äôre a disgrace to to brawl stars community 
---
And the music is freaking annoying it‚Äôs worse than Justin bieber‚Äôs ‚Äòbaby‚Äô

worst map you just created for nothing, like there just one spot to leave until walls destroyed
---
Petition for a teddy bear pajamas Nita skin with stuffed Bruce (button eyes)
---
Thank you!
---
Looks straight from plants vs zombies
---
Paint.net! Been using it for like 3 years so I've gotten the hang of it wirh everything
---
Yesss
---
Puta has another meaning too tho lol
---
Now that i'm thinking i should have included him
---
Agreed
---
Supercell already explained why they won't add skin icons, and this is at least the 10th suggestion about this. Seriously, stop.
---
Where is spike's "pineapple" (or whatever he throws with his special)?
---
To be exact i made that with paint.net and experience
---
Indeed
---
Bibi will beat the life out of anyone who crosses her so ‚Äúlocking up‚Äù Mr.Bat keeps the peace for a while. Plus she doesn‚Äôt look as hostile without it compared to when she does have it.
---
Dude you have been playing since then and don't know why they don't implement it? It would make the game's storage a lot bigger as Frank said. Come on now, think.
---
It's meant to be like in slow motion so some are sprinting and others are jumping into the air really fast
---
I m dyingüòÇüòÇ
---
i know how you feel, today i got the same bad random four times in a row
---
Dude why are you complaining?? Im at 15k with all legendaries and still don't have Shelly smh some ppl
---
actally i saw a video of a piper killing three ar the same time, they just collided at the same frame and pixel.
---
Why Nita looks so adorable? I like it
---
"+3"
---
Is a mod
---
Yes he does. But he tilted him
---
i dont know why, it wasnt me tho
---
Tara is a community idea
---
6/10
---
So cute
---
Have you ever heard of punctuation
---
Isnt "my boy" you, but also me????
---
Solo or duo?
---
Everyone gangsta until colt pulls out the wrong gun
---
Wholesome
---
Well your pretty similar and you also have the same flair
---
Now we are talking
---
... and the game crashes
---
Frank has also that face like "tf is goin on?"
---
bo will fix it
---
Nice one
---
Thats what she said ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
yeah we do!
---
usernames have spike in them but a darryl flair
---
I am just waiting for someone to scream REEE!
---
Hey dude my dad works at supercell so I told him to refund you 1000 trophies. Check your account in 2 hours.
---
If it isnt there, start a solo showdown match and die first. That should update your trophies. If not, repeat this step till it works.
---
Thanks I did it
---
This would have been more easy back then but now that the boss throws rocket at the nearest instead of the farthest brawler, its impressive that you guys pulled this off
---
lol pls support
---
Every piper or crow does this at the end lol
---
Exactly! People think that pixel art isnt effort cuz it tiny but never realize how hard its actually to try to make as similiar character in pixel art as possible
---
More like the power of being against an auto aim Shelly Looool, nicely done in any case! Please trim video next time
---
I knew someone would finally recognize and yes i did take some inspiration from celeste when making the brawlers!
---
what makes anyone think it has anything to do with teaming right?
---
What kinda mod is this?
---
Mod link?
---
Lol that was awesome.
---
Easier said than done.
---
 
---
1. Player must have decent brawler level and willing to use that brawler
---
2. Player must be good and familiar at the game mode. Obviously some people isn't
---
3. Not people are that high at Insane 4
---
Good work I reached 15k
---
yep and it‚Äôs not like you made 1 level of the colors no you tried to make it looks like the characters indeed, and it‚Äôs a drawing, so nothing came out of nowhere you drew every little detail, good job man :P
---
Best colt skin
---
Same goal but I reached it
---
POKEMOOOOOOOOOON
---
You know today the Season ends
---
I would pay anything for this skin. OMFG
---
God just because Bibi can do that shot that doesnt make her Op in higher trophies it takes a lot of skill to use her besides shelly is an op brawler cause she is very easy to use
---
I would kill for that Leon jumper
---
Interesting enough I collected 1870 star points and there was both boxes there. Ended up spending 2000 star points and really did not get anything from them. 6 gems, that's it
---
i think more helth will be ok too
---
YES! Finally someone who know ARMS exists!
---
eh more like 950
---
How to offer my idea?
---
Looks like Towerfall Ascension!!
---
So good as his goal yesterday üëèüëè

---
Nice!
---
I was sleeping and dreamed About I waking up
---
Yeah lmao.I have 0.05 legendary rate and i didn't get my 2nd legendary yet.I got Spike at 0.03 so everything is possible.How come some people at 12k don't have any legendaries and have a big rate.Of course this is normal.
---
Ahem
---
Technically Kairos stole it
---
Thanks! Sorry, didn‚Äôt mean to sound pushy. Take your time :)

cute asf

For sure!! Honestly tho, i used that as inspiration haha
---
why is he lying lol
---
In big game
---
ILL FUCKING DO IT AGAIN
---
Yeah. I enjoy playing Mortis a lot, but don‚Äôt use his flair (because tons of idiots use it)
---
This would be great using darryl rolling to the others island
---
But shelly is still getting nerfs, maybe supercell is nerfing the wrong part about her, maybe bandaid was fine at 2k heal but i guess its just 1v1 interaction that shelly's super is OP which makes her feel OP but can't viably push trophy with her so i think i have to agree with you anyways
---
Thank you!!!
---
Unlucky guy

 Most are still not edited quite well yet, that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm in need of any suggestions

Takedown and LoneStar are basically showdown games but with solo respawn. Notice a solo showdown game ends when one player is remaining, well this happens in takedown and lonestar as well because it thinks you are a solo showdown winner. The game basically stops.
---
does it end tomorrow cos i can tomorrow and my colt is 10

Awesome!!!!

Why dont play showndown 5 place give you the trophie
---
New mortis skin :))
---
They probably wont fix it, I have a weird bug when loading the game (opening the game, not starting a match) it takes a lot of time to load and my phone says "Brawl Stars isnt responding" and i have to choose to wait or close the game. That's just stupid, how can games like Call of Duty Mobile, Fortnite and others that require better phones load faster than Brawl Stars.
---
*unzips* Lord ,forgive me for what i'm about to do

"I never expected fidget spinners to do anything, but ok"

So her race is Indian (or Tamil in Singapore)

I have it too

Bruh that Shelly was a bot ngl

This wouldn't happen if you pushed your brawlers evenly

Lol

Thats old or should i say.... Ancient

U stole it from twitter wtf bro u didnt "draw" it

but it clearly needs to be fixed since you can't play normally if you have lag, it prevents you from showing all your skill and new players may get confused because of it

Well bruce is official, the devs and youtubers confirmed it, but lenny isn't official

when Rico loses, he lays flat on the ground with his head detached. if you look at the meme, the third picture, his neck is missing which means he lost the game.

Sorry to say but your problem is just going to get worse over time until you upgrade your phone. Flagship phones account for around 70% of a company's new phone sales when they are released. If someone just bought a new phone and is new to brawl stars, the likelihood is that they are playing on a newer device that has no issues with loading.
---

Is this on IOS or Android version of lwarb. I have the IOS version but it needs to update still üòì
---
this image was actually an edit, as you can see the "NEXT GOAL" on Mega Box in the 2nd pic is gone
---
But still, don't let that be you. Remember to push your low ranks brawlers instead of focusing on a single brawler for the season!
---
I agree, having Leon is really hard to believe
---
Yas I love Fnaf!
---
Did u buy it already?

Is this a random match? I remember that we can't choose same character in friends play.

Wut
---
I was really surprised too, that's unbelievable
---
spero che piaccia giocare a tutti in questo diverso tipo di mappa
---
this seems fun. i may try that
---
So I can‚Äôt share my opinions?
---
lol XD
---
That‚Äôs right
---
I love it. Matter of fact, I got Gene today!
---
He thought he joined duo showdown
---
I don't get it, pls someone to explainüôè
---
Obviously
---
Rosa's range is broken
---
Reasonable
---
You‚Äôre welcome üëå
---
r/AntiShakers is here, now put your hands up
---
d√©sol√© de prendre si longtemps pour moi r√©pondre en retour.  Et c'est triste
---
Yea ik, but no unit mentions their status, only abilities. Maybe a death line like "how'd you find me??" Or "Hey! My sucker!"
---
Me
---
You losers downvoting me only further prove my point.
---
Thanks guys. I don't play friendly game often, most time play as a team to fight with random.
---
I also have it
---
&gt;d√©sol√© de prendre si longtemps pour moi r√©pondre en retour.  Et c'est triste
---
Oui je suis d'accord
---
How?
---
Your brawlers over 500 lost a portion of their trophies above 500 and you got star points
---
He's overaged, he's free
---
It's because of the Season reset.
---
This is not random. After every season your Brawlers who have above 550 trophies lose trophies and you gain star points.  You can click the rank of the brawler to know what number of trophies it will reset to
---
oooooooooooooooooh
---
Bro mi lasci io link per il download della skin?? Plz
---
Even though you cared enough to comment, as did the others. I love debunking that stupid saying...
---
Suprised pikachu face
---
You need to have minimum 550 trophies on a brawler to get star points
---
Removed. Rule 3. No providing information on how to break Supercell Terms of Service.
---
Wait 3 trophies fron a victory wow that sucks
---
You get star points from brawlers above 550 trophies.
---
You may want Mortis, but have you considered that Mortis doesn‚Äôt want you?
---
Congrats!
---
Leon's super doesn't make his teammates invisible and Sandy's a bit better
---

---

r/AntiShakers is here, now put your hands up you son of a Carl

Your comment is so bad that it makes me want to nuke 1/2 of r/CarlGang
---
It was the opposite for me, I kept waiting for them to all get taken out by a bomb
---
I'm afraid if I awnser this I'll get wooooshed.
---
Yeah. I was just saying that they're similar.
---
Mortis: HINJAKU HINJAKU!

You know it's spooktober right?

Click on the brawl stars subreddit you'll see 3 dots on the right top corner press it and select add flair
---
Isn't it.

Cg my man
---

---
\*wakes up\*
---
I have had this happen. I have learned that if it does this, I close the app and restart. It then works perfectly fine. No lag in the gameplay.
---
Tick was in party with shelly
---
Not mad though
---
So what?
---
Wait, wait, dude, why don't we just forget our grudges and make a 69 joke? FUUUU N N YYYYY
---
Ye this happens to me too but now it's even worse I can barely move in games now so I straight up barely ever play the game anymore
---
Whats up slappers
---
Nice.
---
OMG
---
EPIC
---
Just a grown man and child sharing a beer together nothing weird at all
---
"Bye bye stupid!" lmao
---
Bibi's bath water
---
Both of those goals were gonna go in even if you didn't have the speed boost, and the "defensive mistake" where you jumped past the mortis also wasn't corrected either because the primo didn't even get one hit on the mortis after lol 
---
But I do agree that meteor rush is a great power on brawl ball, just don't think this clip really shows it lol
---
only bulls will play on this mapüòÇ
---
Hi
---
No I'm not. I'm just amazed that it happened.
---
This meme is dead

Or they‚Äôre just lying for attention...
---
I have 25 brawlers, 7 level 9-10 and all others are maxed on power points (level 7-8), I only need gold. Been playing daily since global launch.
---
So don't worry, you'll get there eventually.
---
I think most of them would be in countries that are kinda poor
---
Poco if he manages to get away from people by a bunch of cubes.
---
Probably, mostly in Asia and Africa
---
Is gods plan guys...Gods plan
---
Damn that‚Äôs a lot of money for just 1 brawler
---
Yeah
---
I made a post avout that a while ago O_O

My apology then
---
People being really dumb saying that u/JukeGasterov is stealing from u/Gedi-Kor.  
---
Have people actually tried checking Gedi-kor's actual posts?  
---
Seems to me people were just: "Ooga booga, halloween in dis post, ooga booga, halloween in Gedi-kor, ooga booga, dis guy plagiarize? ".
---
I don't think Gedi-kor made the damn logo, even if he did, than why do countless YouTube videos use the logo without getting into trouble? Does that mean that the logo is not copyrighted????? Hmmmmmmmmmmm...
---
Think damn it, do some research. I don't even play the damn game.
---
the clash royale and brawl stars crossover where bo and shelly were in royale

i like this map. i can easily push short range brawlers to 500 and its nice cuz i am too noob and cant do it in any other mode lol
---
The range wasn‚Äôt a bug they just fixed the animation because the actual range wasn‚Äôt showing
---
eBic
