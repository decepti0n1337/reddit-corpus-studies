She doesn't

---
---
Still dude, to have all of em 500 is pretty crazy. I'd love to play some games with you, and get some tips.
---
Still got 172 gems left
---
I got the same deal as you did but I already have Spike. I'm also F2P.
---
Lol 
---

---
Its a bit outdated but search 
---
Shelly then and now
---
Bull then and now
---
Etc
---
Ops lol
---
Damn, that's impressive. I love it!
---
2017 humor
---
When I make this joke I get down voted lol. Have an upvote.
---
They don‚Äôt have to spend money. They could have just played for the tokens daily and gotten lucky
---
Praying a lot doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean skill
---
Just because you all dont like siege does not mean they should take it away from everyone, but i understand how you are intimidated by its more complex and unforgiving gameplay. I love all game modes, y'all should be more inclusive ;)
---
the forth one wouldnt make sense ( the jumping one) because dynamikes‚Äôs star power is literally that.
---
You are a good player
---
I woke up thinking seige was back, but it was brawl ball. I‚Äôm sure everyone is happy!
---
Rosa's movement speed is 770, Crow's is 820, so she can't catch up. You're probably referring to her really long range, which everyone agrees is too much.
---
I care
---
Capture the Spike sock
---
Yes please!!!
---
OP posting and drawing smth about the state of balance patch and here half the reaction are some feminist lvl answer about color skin...
---
same
---
Who doesn't?
---
Thanks for the help!
---
Dune Drift FTW
---
Yeah I wish it was brawlball forever.
---
Are you willing to sell these?
---
My problem are the people who run the ball back to our goal and kick it in for the team. I see this at least once every five matches. 
---
I don‚Äôt understand why people even queue for the game type if they are just going to grief their own team.
---
^(yes primo gives us the gems)
---
I know. Just putting it out there.
---
I concur
---
At least thats a Rosa and Rosa is decent in brawl ball
---
11141 :D
---
I too prefer to win a game over loosing one.
---
Agreed!
---
Ik but that's after the nerf.
---
Lol.
---
That is not my experience. most games I get one player who actively runs into a corner near our goal and refuses to participate. 
---
One in five matches I get a player that actively tries to get the ball and once they do, they take it back to our goal and score for the other team. 
---
It‚Äôs infuriating.
---
Now that takes dedication. 
---
I believe the most game I did with one random is around 20ish and that took close to an hour already
---
1. No, they change health/ damage right before they die
---
2. I am aware that darryl fires twice per shot, it was not like that
---
3.usually a small amount, just enough so they dont die, but rarely its a big burst, and its all different brawlers
---
Sorry to bust your bubble. Barely got out because you had a lot more power cubes :)
---
By... using powerpoints?
---
Call all units,FBI need see this
---
but they wouldn't have enough brawl boxes because they lost all their games.
---
My opinions on all of these Concepts:
---
Conveyor belt; Imagine having gems spawn on this towards your base, It is a genius concept, should be added. üëç 10/10
---
High Walls; These would be a HUGE indirect nerf to throwers, maybe modify it so supers can go over, and would things like Piper's, Crow's, and El Primo's Supers be able to go over? 8/10
---
Burning Grass;I personally think the damage should go down to 600 at least, because, again its a nerf to low health brawlers. Its still really good though.
---
Maybe have it caused by bushes being destroyed? 9/10
---
Mini Pads; This is my least favorite out of all of these due to 2 facts.
---
1. We already have normal jump pads.
---
2. They activate instantly. They could be a pain.
---
With a few tweaks, you could u-turn my opinion, but its still a creative idea.
---
I mean, who else would think of Mini Pads? You have a good mind. 5/10
---
Rail Pads;  This is practically a faster, more dangerous version of the conveyor belt.
---
It shouldn't kill, it should only knock back, and deal some damage. Still giving it a good rating. Creative. 9/10
---
Leafy Bush; A quite good concept, would nerf bush campers. Getting tired of those campers. üëç10/10
---
Ammo box; Wow. 3 Times the reload speed for 8 seconds. I would do 2.5 for 4 seconds. Three Times for eight seconds is OP. It is still a creative idea. Supercell should add this as an event modifier. 8/10
---
Bomb; If I were to put the damage for this, I would put 3000 damage. It should have a burn damage of 50 damage a second for 3 seconds. This is a really good concept possibly the best out of all of these. üëçüëçüëçüëçüëç11/10
---
Summary; All of these concepts are creative and unique. They are all good in some way. Where did you get these ideas?
---
U less you use the point cards on a brawler to max. The remaining points are wasted!
---
Say that when 80% of the random you get are autistic who play worse than bots , go afk and score in your own goal/run to the enemy when they have gems or high bounty
---
Wait this isn't shane dawson
---
You get the same amount of brawl boxes everyday no matter how much you win or lose as long as you play a few games
---
Capture the flag &gt; heist &gt; siege
---
I only got spike from this because 1. Spike is the only legendary i want and 2. I already have crow and 3. I like leon but i still prefer spike.
---
Story mode?
---
Wrong
---
???
---
When they heal up a bit, how many seconds elapsed before the last time they were hit?
---
They leaked thing about new update to brazilian youtubers and  brazil won the world cup 5 times which probably means that brawl ball will be here for 2 more days and new brawler will be something about soccer
---
I disagree the last siege can completely turn it around.
---
Agreed. Shutdown was more challenging without the modifiers. Like I don‚Äôt need a freakin robot chasing me when I‚Äôm trying to finish off the last teamer or (whatever you call the hiding mofos)
---
We wish
---
Yourfamilygon
---
You tried to team at the end so you don‚Äôt deserve one lol hypocrite

Its nearly instantaneous

Bill is very smart (hey Bill can you friend me?) My team is always trash.
---
New Brawler: Ney 
---
Epic 
---
He shoots Soccer Balls toward the enemy, his Super makes him fall but the same gains advantage against the enemy. Your Star Power gives you the advantage of rolling when you fall, giving speed
---
I'm not giving you hugs
---
Ok thanks for sharing the info. Unfortunately I can't explain what you're seeing, and I and others haven't seen any of these in months and months of playing, so I don't know what to tell you. Try and get your brawlers to 300+ trophies each and see if you still encounter the same issues. Good luck.
---
T H A N K. Y O U! Someone normal!
---
We fucking need high walls. I'm tired of Dynamikes and barely's
---
The shop always has a chance of giving you the exact number you need to power them up
---
Actually I made the ideas just because they popped out of my mind so I had to illustrate them graphically.
---
[removed]
---
I agree except I would swap mortis and Nita
---
Math almost checks out.
---
It's nice when you have teammates who won't quit the second they lose. My rule of thumb is 2 losses in a row.
---
I mean for shotgunners
---
Awww thank you!!
---
Whats permafrost?
---
to access what?
---
Meh?
---
MEH?!?!?
---
Poyo!
---
For real. I have 40 gems. I only need Crow to complete the collection.
---
damn,brawl stars is just a baby close to minecraft.
---
The primo waa trying to perform the glitch where you jump with the super while carrying the ball, which doesn't work anymore.
---
doubt trophy has anything to do with anything. am 4.8k with only crow missing . rest i got from boxes
---
And I.... am....... 
---
SHELLY WITH SUPER
---
Nice skin idea!
---
The title is ‚Äòteamers...‚Äô yet you yourself was teaming lmao
---
I dont talk to noobs, sorry
---
And another colt gone
---
Everyone got that...
---
Thank god
---
the shelly and leon is literally very smart
---
Yes.
---
That is how I win
---
No
---
Thh they deserve it after they team on you
---
I have several questions regarding this photo
---
To give an example, why the fuck is a tank competing in tennis.
---
Why bro?
---
In Italian they named him Chef Dynamike...
---
Oops...
---
Why is he T-POSING
---
Pipis is the only ultimate god nothing can stop her
---
Holy shit that looks so real
---
:P
---
How i can change the range of the brawlers?
---
I think it should replace Showdown so BB is permanent
---
OBEY YOUR GOD NIGHTMARE PIPER
---
im really unlucky with spike...  my legendary droprate is higher than my mythic droprate and i still havent got him
---
Bruh he just said that white crow was a flaw
---
gosh!!
---
Bruh
---
lol
---
Yo, if it ain't that much money for y'all anyway, but me some gems pls
---
You mean 1492?

It‚Äôs been 122 days.

Just wondering is this for sale?

I got Spike at 1.2k trophies. He's maxed at rank 18 now.
---
Heartwarming
---
lmao mortis butt
---
What! Meh tire ?
---
ahah jokes on you op got a samsung note 10+ pro
---
You mean 2012
---
The real question is could you send the Friend request and did he accept it
---
Oh no haha
---
Lul 10.000 trophies
---
im often the one dying
---
I miss the system where your could choose to upgrade either damage health ore super damage
---
It‚Äôs the best Leon map imo. I got him to 500 there and then I got him down to 355 and then got h back to 500 with passage
---
B R O C C is better
---
r/engrish
---
lmao this is too funny. F
---
Thanks! This is my first map created so glad you liked it!
---
What show is that?

Mortis would destroy
---
I don't know what it has to do with the new update but I have a feeling that it does relate to it.
---
Ok

Okj

Delete the app now!

Colt: Am I a joke to you?
---
uwu
---
I liked the old ui and old systems
---
u made me rewind this 2938429 times to notice it
---
It could mean Spike is now present.
---
Not it‚Äôs not a lot of money but then again I said the same thing on clash of clans and then spent easily three times as much on clash royale. Then I just lose interest in the games and stop playing or see how bad they‚Äôve become and it‚Äôs no longer fun to play.
---
Desperate times calls for desperate measures.
---
Not really, I have seen yesterday a post here, where a player has all brawlers 500+ trophies and all of them are 1 level. So, everything is possible )
---
Nita: An entire watermelon.
---
Nita is just loafing around.
---
I have Leon, and spike (both maxed) and I obsess over having crow but I think spike is the best legendary card out of the 3.
---
*crab rave music plays*
---
You‚Äôve got to love it when they try bm in front of your goal then they fuck it up and you win

Yes this is the most logical

I have the same opinion, i wanted spike and he was the brawler that got me into the game, but then i saw crow [and because im edgy] then i changed my mind, my original name was cactus, which i changed later on.
---
You mean 0001
---
This should actually cost 150 gems

It's cosmetic homie

You've never heard of the legend Merkzz??

This is so sweet

Awesome!

Not bad

there is a reddit watermark. look it up and add it to your memes.

How come they dropped the whole Wild West moniker?

as a kirby fan i approve

that spin at the end lol
---
No you you you
---
What's wrong with seige yo?
---
Yes
---
it's not THAT special imo. its makes him yellow, also adds an new attack/super animation and those eyebrow things. thats about it.
---
No don't touch Darryl he is good.
---
Rosa is smol
---
So true.......And so evil
---
In 3v3s like siege, bounty, bb and gem grab your team can easily work against you. Luck again. In bb my teamate mortis scored 2 goals against us bc he got to the ball first. In bounty you can let them farm and in gg and siege suicide near opponents base to give them gems/bolts. And that isn't something rare, at least not for me. If it doesn't happen to you then you are in fact lucky. Can random teamate destroy you in SSD? Not if you are not teaming with opponent because you are alone. Can your random teamate in SSD suicide to give opponent power cubes?  
---
And not only skill of teamate matters but also brawler since team composition is important in 3v3, while it doesn't exist in SSD. Now you can say other brawlers do exist, but that is more skill based than luck if you know how to take them down.
---
they all smol &lt;3 I love smol
---
They did my boi dirty. Brick will get his revenge when Simon comes out
---
Lmao truuuu
---
wait wat i got the skin for 210 gems
---
Man are you dumb? I just said that
---
Maybe because you can't win heist by only defending üôÑ
---
It‚Äôs a meme and an idea DIPSHIT. Spikes and their brainlessness
---
What is that? Can you explain to me please??
---
I agree with u but I know a lot of people who would disagree with u as  from personal experience they have died many times to bad randoms. Personally I agree with u but I‚Äôm doing this for the people who think randoms are bad. Because they not that bad
---
I DON'T LAVA THIS
---
damn no wonder u really are good
---
X doubt
---
I had enough gems for that skin in the shop, there was a bug where I clicked to open the free boxes and instead it bought this skin for me...
---
So now I have phoenix crow and wasted 250 gems

Thank god. My friend said he thinks that it would be in the next next update, so seeing you say the same made me think I missed something.

Oh ok
---
I'd like a buff to Shelly's Super charge also.
---
Thats what i was going to say
---
I hate brawl ball so bad, its more impossible with randoms than siege
---
Lol you deserve an upvote!
---
r/BrawlRecruit
---
Literally any tank except Rosa.
---
I‚Äôm sorry sir I can‚Äôt answer that one.
---
 There is only  2 ways to get a new brawler fast.
---
1) Gem the heck out of the game
---
Or
---
2) Save up a crap ton of boxes then open them (save the mega box from trophy road if you are 4000+)
---
Yes, sure!
---
Context?
---
Because 90% of them are kids under 14 who can't play a team game just brainless battleroyals.
---
Yo just fyi you accidentally reposted this twice
---
God form no u
---
Brawl Bawl &amp; Siege are the worst. I just don‚Äôt play them.
---
I didn't see it... thanks!
---
Other nita i play against cant aim for shit lmao
---
Unacceptable
---
Oh ok. Sorry for that
---
I rarley aee darryl played well i cant use him he just depend on his starpower
---
What does it mean?
---
lets all take a moment to remember siege
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
aw forget it siege was trash nobody cared
---
I got crow @1274 trophies don't @ me ffs
---
Thats not how 3d perspective works but ok
---
Because it increases extremely slowly :Thinking:
---
Are there really bots in the game?
---
One of the best artwork I've ever seen.  Great job
---
It really is just bad luck then. Consider making a second account.
---
~~agfdg nghgmj~~
---
Thank you very much ^_^
---
Do you know any way of contacting supercell not the robot communication in the game like an email.or something?
---
Looks like 17 bulls are waiting form me in that
---
Haha, Okay then
---
you have 4 Karma lol
---
add a flair for the brawler you main
---
If you‚Äôre complaining so much why don‚Äôt you give a suggestion on how to fix it huh?
---
My best is 5:43
---
So bo is from a eagle tribe. Nita is a bear tribe why can‚Äôt leon be from a Chameleon tribe? There are plenty of  more modern tribes.
---
I will
---
Siege's my favorite mode, you can push trophies really quickly if you have one of your good club mates online
---
Tell me 1 time supercell listened to us fans and this is my 1st time complaining bcs I rarely see teaming
---
My point is that there‚Äôs no way to fix it. You can‚Äôt even think of an idea in the first place that they will listen to
---
LMAO. That guy has a hard brain. Leave him be.
---
I think he is saying it looks so good it looks legit
---
i can't sleep üò´ delete it üò®
---
But it‚Äôs such a good skin. Like Phoenix crow &gt; every other skin in the game
---
Make it rain bro, make it rain..
---
Can you post a link to download when it‚Äôs done?
---
Yes I can think a few that Ive wanted to post in the past but they seemed dumb first thongs first when someone spins close to someone 20tiles or lower your health gets halfed for 30secs or when soneone gets close to someone without hurting each other for 3sec they loose 1k hp per second
---
Ok crow is stoned
---
ah, The times when you could win a 1v1 on top of each other Dyna vs Bull
---
I‚Äôm sure that more than 99% hated Cavern churn
---
no one cares
---
I cant believe that there is someone who loves siege
---
I feel your pain...
---
Idk but i remember frank the bs dev said something abou that
---
You‚Äôre the reason they don‚Äôt listen to ideas, do you realize how dumb that sounds in application?
---
Nutshell of community maps
---
Very nice
---
It‚Äôs mortis
---
Well yes, but actually no
---
I didn‚Äôt play much before global, however I still got some nostalgia from this. 
---
Other than that little nostalgia I have, the old icons are not appealing to me at all. They are quite honestly the reason why I quit the game. IIRC the game wasn‚Äôt even fully 3D originally.
---
Maybe is mortys with his rock and roll skin
---
It may be a chance...
---
2D graphics should've been included 
---
Whatever
---
 All of you kids 15 and under that are over 4k trophies... How much money did you pay to the game with your moms or dads credit card though?? I have payed 0 money and im at 3k struggling because i have 0 epics 0 mythics and 0 leggies
---
I believe it‚Äôs either legendary or mythic
---
Shameless Repost.

hey, i would appreciate it if you go to my profile and look at my theory about him, thanks!
---
Every brawler has a gang. The only 2 relevant ones are mortis and crow though.
---
Yeah I think I‚Äôm pretty lucky...üòÖ
---
Colt threw him out
---
It's simply amazing upvote üòâüëç
---
Leon skin?!
---
MWAHAHA! NEVER!
---
Dude, this has happened to me since Rosa's update. Matchmaking gets disgusting sometimes. My theory is that the game actually wants you to lose once in a while by teaming you up with people that are already on a lose streak. And I'm no professional to only blame the team though, but finally got 7500 trophies yesterday after 3 weeks on loss.
---
What I do: I simply quit when I get 3 or 4 losses in a row. Normally, insisting on playing when matchmaking gets messed up only makes me wanna punch myself, and I've already gotten -300 trophies in such strikes. When I return, things tend to get better.
---
Sucks to suck
---
‚óã_‚óã

Bats the damage you take out of you
---
That shirt is way too short

wtf ;-;

Update will definitely not be tomorrow since people don't work on weekends. I think there'll be a high likelihood of Brawl Talk tomorrow though
---
Oh cool

Its my edgy goth gf
---
Still better than riko darryl and penny though

May be the Reddit account is the YouTube guy's account? How can you be so sure he stole it?

But you can't push Powercubes!

Just watch the video

I read that as rockbrick brawl stars
---
Basically A Legendary
---
Thats how it goes when ppl get excited for new content ;)
---
Just cuz they have a legendary does not mean they are skilled or stronger than average
---
Yeah that colt was a god colt
---
lets say Brawl talk then ü§î
---
I did that with primo and I shot into my own goal...
---
There's no voice of him/her
---
I have watched the video quite a few times now and, in my opinion, this brawler is definitely a woman. Also, her voice is very similar to piper.
---
But what's the god damn point?! There's just hundreds of "new brawler? üëÄüëÄüëÄ"
---
Maybe a Shelly skin
---
Now i can kill noobs irl
---
Looks edgy tbh
---
What‚Äôs the purple thing? Wings?
---
I like showdown but i like siege too
---
Honestly, after global release, all brawlers released are either OP or are completely unusable, Supercell needs to come up with a new test for them
---
ficaria meio estranho se fosse

Is that a young Morris?!

whoever does this deserves to lose 100 trophies

Counter to Rosa?

My crow is on sale for like $30 USD lmao too bad the special offers weren‚Äôt decent.

JOJO!

Yeah it does dumbass

Me too? What is it actually?

Oh you are right it's a sword/katana!

I almost sure I‚Äôd played with you, perhaps brawl ball or siege, one or two weeks ago. Btw my nick is Unicornio

Already technically have that with Mortis so I doubt it.

My guess is that it's gonna be an Epic brawler

He's wearing stud earrings which I just did some research that that's not exclusive to girls anymore.

Me: just trying to get my key from brawl ball

Rosa with star power appears: nice try.

Crow just looks realy cool

√© um homem e seu nome √© simon

I didnt repost. It seems like someone had the same idea before

rock wall brawl lol
---
No idea... he could throw baseballs? We‚Äôll just have to wait and see. If they were to make it a new brawler, i dont think they would make one that is incredibly similar to Leon (Short and Covering eyes) Itll just make them seem unoriginal.
---
Please tell me how to do that
---
It‚Äôs still this way, Rosa is inevitable.
---
Do you remember the name of the bot that throws bottles?

Lmfao The best post iv seennin the whole reddit and iv been here for 5 months now or less üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ LOL

I think it's rockwall brawl

or his aunt, or step father... or nephew
---
i mean if u notice carefully bunny penny(at least) looks more animated with sharp edges now, rather than more smooth flowing and realistic

I think both are fine as they are

She or he has a shotgun probably a long range shooter or a reskin of leon Which is not possible since that person has a shotgun

Either Bull's getting a Crow skin or Crow's getting a Bull skin idk

No it isn't. Sometimes they offer exactly the amount of power points you need for a level up! It's a old and proven supercell trick!
---
I have to agree with you. It is kind of hard having a different attack that is none like the others. Some of the brawlers even have similar attacks but different mechanics like El Primo and Rosa. Thanks for your opinion though!
---
I‚Äôm robot and this is my stand, other robot.

Sjould be "I'm not a bad bot" because some bots are good
---
Of course, but imagine this, Brawler with fastest move speed in the game, even Crow. Probably would be a Mythic if you asked me but I don't know, melee range a bit wider and reaching further than Mortis, swings a bat left, then right on the next shot. Super would charge in four swings and it would buff your brawler in damage, and reload speed by 10%, and all other brawlers on their team would get the same buff but a 30% heal as well, no matter where they were, star power could be making the super also heal the brawler itself for 5%
---
same dude, they are so annoying
---
Buff Leon
---
I was referencing one of pyrocynical's old vids but alright
---
I was watching the video in first hour
---
I knew we would get cascade of these post so I passed it
---
It depends if he is random or not.
---
If he is random, say goodbye to those gems, if not, than you may have a win on your hands
---
Has anyone ever thought that we might get a new splash screen? I think its time
---
Cant remember. But as you can see, this post has been eliminated for plagiarizing

Imagine getting demonetized because of YouTube‚Äôs automatic subs
---
Now 5020.before I had 5140
---
Sorry, I just really like to theorize...
---
Also, many people suspect a story mode in the new retropolis update, and this is just my opinion on the possible story's main character.
---
With the Android Q beta I'm pretty sure they changed around how local storage works for apps, so apps that aren't ready for that may not function properly. None of the supercell games work for me so it just seems that they haven't made their games ready for that.
---
Free rewards are Decent for newbies
---
At start, u only need about 10 coins to level up and small amount of pp (what r u thinking u dirty minded) to level up
---
OMG beautiful job mate! How do you get that shiny wood-ish look?! It's amazing
---
Not going to work nerfing the shield isn't the problem she needs a rework
---
She needs a hp shield instead of a dmg reduction one
---
And her super shouldn't be activated when getting dmg but instead should charge up like Darrel's
---
Otherwise she'll instantly be able to shield up again and again if she's close to you
---
Or  I delated it.
---
More like:

but it was pretty "confusing" to some players and that's why they removed it.
---
I do. Beat it, kid.
---
And the Psycho Leon skin cost 30 gems... This is my ideea..
---
Yeah, but she is only a side character in them. Also, Colt's at the center of the loading screen. I personally prefer Shelly to Colt, but this just appears to be the direction the game is going.
---
oops I forgot to write the last t in my signature. excuse me for that.
---
Barley has a much better control Super even after the nerf (especially, actually, since the nerf made the damage more consistent), and Spike also cannot kill a Mortis if Mortis knows what he's doing. And why are you putting up the bush argument? That's literally true with everyone except for Bo, so it's really irrelevant.
---
Barley's main attack hits much easier, and deals more control damage. Barley's Star Power heals much more effectively, and doesn't take up a use of the Super. You're saying that Barley's Super isn't broken, when Spike can't even use his Super offensively because he should constantly heal up.
---
I don't have Leon, but my friend does, and I've played Leon several times. Leon is strong, even without Star Power. What you are saying is just because you are bandwagoning with the rest of the community so that you can get a broken brawler

Ok I just discounted it is crow (maybe idk if he would wear blue
---
Me too ,_,)
---
Oh look it's me.
---
Oh hello
---
Maybe nerf his range a bit, or make his attack pattern wider? I really don't want to touch his sp or Super.
---
I have also seen a suggestion which said that Leon's ammo shouldn't naturally reload until he used all three slots, which seems like a good nerf for him because it makes him vulnerable for several seconds.
---
Leon does jot have a bat lmao
---
*Carl is my name, mocking kids on reddit is my game*

Nah, it's just the funky 50's60's hairdo stuff.

LEON SKIN!!!!!
---
We don't know if this is going to be Brawl Talk. The chances are high though
---
Wow dude I didn‚Äôt mean to make you angry or something sorry ;) still imo Leon is trash now and what does barley have to do with this. U think he is overpowered because your friends are probably those lucky people who get legendary in like 1000 trophies so they play with noobs and win. He is not good in higher trophies really. Stop comparing spike to barley and start comparing him to leon. Our argument is about spike and leon after all ;)
---
Lol thanks for the correction.
---
Everyone: new brawler coming soon
---
Supercell: I don't know why they are all getting riled up we are just releasing a new bull skin

And its gems not power cubes

Oh, you are approving your skills with each new art. It's cool~
---
The real question is what he's holding
---
Ah sh\*t, here we go again.
---
help *nervous shaking* HEEEELP
---
The name "Simon" was only made up from a theory of a post on the Brawl Stars Twitter, where it showed a picture of what seemed to be Brock or his brother and Carl. The picture was a reference of the real Simon and Carlfunkel. I think the whole community is pretty damn sure that this new Brawler will be called Simon, but if you watch the "Welcome to Retropolis!" video, you can hear the new Brawler making a deep female voice, so the chances of the new Brawler being called "Simon" are probably pretty slim. We'll just have to find out and see.
---
they cant put that name in game, copyright.

btw the skin is so cool

Thank you

Fine. I guess I'll have to do it myself, then....

He is assassin he is pretty bad alone but can pick off low health brawlers trying to escape
