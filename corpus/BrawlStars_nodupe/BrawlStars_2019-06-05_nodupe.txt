this says nothing but you are just luckyÔºåmost of my randoms are shit no matter in skill or strategyÔºåand lower 1-3 ranks away
---
I think that each brawler has 3 star powers but you can change between them
---
nah I am serious
---
The Background shows it's Minecarft lol
---
Yeah, I mean we are all randoms. They‚Äôre not all bad. If you‚Äôre consistently losing it may be you that‚Äôs the problem.
---

---
If you start throwing matches and trolling then it‚Äôs *definitely* you that‚Äôs the problem, and you‚Äôve become a huge jerk.
---
Yep, and the new shop that when opened, first opens show a value pack then the actual buildings. Along with that the shop button always has a little dot like a notification but it‚Äôs just some dumb value pack.

Since when did tencent buy supercell?  I am completely oblivious to this

its not I am consistently losingÔºåI can win but those teammates are just shitÔºåand I am tired of carrying two trash

F for t pose
---
You're right, but it's been months since this photo was leaked and several brawlers have been released in the meantime.
---
Dunno, a few years ago? Try Googleing it.
---
Maybe a report feature so they get penalized if they get reported by enough people? If it‚Äôs uncontrollable by the player, nothing should happen, but I agree it is annoying for people to stop playing mid game.
---
My poor little mortician üò≠ ..... what if he transforms colt into a vampire so they can spend eternity together üòç
---
Then join a club, I guess. Or quit?
---
Ruining other peoples‚Äô games is not the answer.
---
it's just a matter of skill
---
Internet connection shifts mid game? The game crashes? Phone call? I‚Äôve left many games for those reasons and I don‚Äôt think I should lose twice as many trophies for something that‚Äôs not my fault
---
I'm mostly always have 20 powercubes on Poco lol

Must have top hat

THANKS OMG i really appreciate it :')

Should have put Carl from jimmy neutron

Well that's why I saying, to compensate for that the rounds should be shorter

Private matches don't count -_-

Great post!
---
i think darryl is bad because i have everything at over rank 13 but darryl is stuck at 8 xD. also why i Dont like Darryl is that he has a really bad super. a way to buff him is to make him invincible during his super or you can increase the range of his super to bulls
---
Yooo I'd buy that album for the concyert alone
---
It did &lt;3 Thank you!

Guess your right

I know that bud

Shelly able to pull enemies a little bit closer to her (1 tile) when she has a lot of health and push enemies a little bit away when low health
---
Yeah
---
Isn't this a repost?
---
You get paired with people of similar trophy level. Just get more trophies
---
It turns out they acquired majority of owner ship  in 2016 for around 8billion dollars
---
Most people who say most of their randoms are shit......need to look in the mirror.
---
SeRiOuS bLaCk
---
it's a mobile party game people shouldn't take it to heart if they die in it
---
Not private lol
---
Friends don't always play brawl stars. Playing with randoms is what most people do and it relies down to:  
---
1. Are they good
---
2. Will they leave the game 10 seconds after the game starts
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Being good at the game won't help if your teammates are trash

*Cough*  can i show myself
---
Then what‚Äôs the point of upgrading? If matchmaking is based on power, you‚Äôd have power 1 pros going against power 1 noobs constantly instead of very rarely when a new brawler comes out. Not only that, but power has zero to do with skill. I beat a team of all power 10s with a power 8 and two power 7s on my mini earlier tonight. Because we had more skill.
---
I do agree that idiots that rage quit and stuff like that they should be punished and it was a what if situation I did not say specifically they would crack there head opens I just meant if the get injured in general.
---
Someone would probably pay $100
---
Frank should have a circle of graveyards spawn where a stunned enemy dies, and   when inside that circle, Frank's damage increases by 30%. They have 3000 hp. This is his star power
---
I only spin if I'm about to win a match
---
Not trying to hate, but the Rosa was just shit or it was on purpose
---
Regardless. If somebody needs help you put the fucking game down do you realize how stupid you sound? Of course I‚Äôm gonna go help someone if they need it who tf picks a game over helping someone
---
Ok?
---
The f$#k you say to me
---
Just a coincidence, lol
---
ok?
---
We seriously need to ban these type of players
---
I'm guessing you mean destroying the enemy team about 4 times and end up winning by 35 stars /s

Had a dude on Robo Rumble the other day just spin in circles the whole time. I had exhausted all my ticket purchases in Shop and spent all the tickets I had built up. Bet my last 20 tickets on that match and we made it maybe 2 mins if that. I was so pissed man. There really does need to be a report button. If you don‚Äôt care or don‚Äôt have the time to commit to a full game, don‚Äôt play.

Anyone: What do you main?

Me at 4k:Uhhh... (All to 7lvl and 12+rank) Bull(?)

TFW Brawl is a top 3 game on twitch but only because all the popular streamers were paid a metric fuckton. Doubt they play again üòí

Have some optimism boyz. Maybe this will be a regular thing for us now.... üò¢
---
He said that nobody wants a Battle Pass, but still, nice design
---
There needs to be low skill cap brawlers or else the game would be too hard for most players
---
Bois = people
---
Ridiculous.
---
Wait this is a one and only make. That took me 6 hours to paint and 7 hours to print
---
Yea go ahead and be the shit random and contribute to ruining the game. Nice job, man
---
It will be available anytime and at the same price, may even get an offer.

so theres an brazilian youtuber who's promoted by supercell leaked that this will be an tournament with dr lupo shroud pokimane ninja dakotaz, you can also check his channel its Royale News.

hey thanks for the 23 karma

You do realize that that literally cut his main attack damage in half and his super damage in quarter, right?

Why did this not end with Skyrim?

What about a new brawler: High Roller!
---
Attacks: Gambler‚Äôs Heaven
---
Has three attacks, each with special abilities!
---
1st shot: Chip bag! Like Penny‚Äôs attack, but with a bag and poker chips for the coins. Can inflict slowness(50 percent chance).
---
2nd shot:Dicesplosion!: High roller lobs two dice which explode the second they hit the ground. Each on can deal 1000 damage each(max level)
---
3rd shot:Game End!: High Roller shoots out dollar bills all around himself, but takes 50 damage. Each one does 100 damage!
---
Super:That‚Äôs a Whopper!: High Roller launches an Enormous Dice in one direction, dealing 1000 damage and depending on the number when it stops deals (1000,1100,1200,1300,1400,1500, or 1600 damage in an explosion. 
---
Star power: When High Roller attack‚Äôs, he gets excited to gamble and increases his shot speed!

You spelled ‚Äòbecause‚Äô backwards wrong...

welp, that‚Äôs subjective i guess. you don‚Äôt see people dressing up for other supercell mobile games, or that many mobile games at all for that matter

I think this would be op but Penny‚Äôs cannon bombs can destroy terrain

Thas so right

I‚Äôm guessing your new to reddit

You actually have 21 trophies

Not new I just worded badly

Honestly in any community except the ones for fortnite everyone is hating on it way too much

Ninja, Pokimane, and other big streamers because they were paid

Sorry I say this but Rico used to SUCK

Then why not super it back up?

Um it literally says on the top left "EPIK" did you stole this or did you get permission from EPIK?

Just because you spent a long time making a meme doesn't make it high quality. If it is high quality then it must use a new meme format or is something no one has heard of, instead or regurgitating what everyone has said again and again

how does this have any connection with brawl stars?

But pinks gonna have another slot open

Perfectly balanced as all things should be...

If you know how much bs exists and how long fortnite exist, then the views are very logic

When you play with randoms -9999999 trophi because randoms so noobs

do without the  rewards its just training camp

Yup, thats his official name

Stacking doesnt increase your odds of getting a legendary. After a certain amount of boxes opened, your chances will increase by 0.0048% regardless if you stackes boxes or not. Stacking only makes the experience more exciting or in the case of maxed players, they have to do it since they cant get anything other than coins from boxes. And id only recommend stacking if a new brawler is about to be released. Other than that, you're better off opening them the moment you get them if you're not maxed
---
you are retarded
---
Wdym i have him max as a f2p

I cant beat the shit out of you if I dont come any closer

That you fucking stole

brawl Stars Were can Be the Best if u Add a Update with Battle pass and Something evetyday i get something and If u can get gems From Trophy road like u got 6000 Trohys And u get 30 ore 40 gems
---
Just remove the Coins And add them too gems 
---
It Will Be So SUPER AND FUNNY AGAIN bcs i gor 8500 and its lame bcs its just come skins + Maps Nothing other
---
I did that with Rico
---
Yes no more suicidal songs
---
But i team
---
d i s g r a c e f u l
---
and then backstab and spin lol
---
RASENGAN!
---
Agreed. I too have people in my club who are like that, I tell them not to use brawlers they like because they don‚Äôt do good in that mode or map but they never listen and we lose
---
The most expensive skin in Brawl stars is only $30. Without discount. Epic brawlers usually cost $15 without discount so Idk what you're talking about
---
and backstab because it's too EZ
---
Thank you

In addition, "You lying hacker" makes more sense than "Lying hacker"

What fine liner did you use?
---
I mean without BlueStacks, an official Supercell version.
---
I meet name spike crow leon  XD
---
That would be a lot of fun, but I doubt they plan to do it
---
1. Its a skin from a free game. Most PC games are premium (i said MOST)
---
2. U can get brawlers easily from a box if u keep playing long enough 
---
3. If a FREE game doesn't have any Microtransactions or a payments, then that games NOT going to last ling enough. Major reason why ppl plays games for years is because they want to experience and explore the endgame and FULL content (kinda lacking in bs but will be fixed in the future) but if u can max an account in less than a year, thats a bad thing if u want to make a game thats lasting for years.
---
[Kairos explains it perfectly here](https://youtu.be/UDNfSaoeFLk)  but Imma guess u r gonna say "well he is a supercell ytber and he is biased" well, Idk what to tell u

They might have moneys in priority but thats after making quality games thats lasting

Press F to pay respects
---
The El Primo of Bounty
---
New brawler
---
3K Trophies, Rank 18 Leon with Star Power
---
Mortis can already beat the crap out of a whole Gem Grab team of two squishies and a Shelly/Darryl, but his stats *do* suck a little.
---
It's not that I'm innocent, it's that I can tell by that your flair alone, you *are* one of those types of people.
---
You need to wait for it to update, it doesnt happen right away
---
That would be such an elegant solution!
---
I see that too. I watched a Barley backstab a Dynamike, then the other dynamikes chucked TNT at him, and as Mortis I'm proud to say I teamed with the Barley and killed all three of them. Madlad stole all my kills too. Spun in the poison in mad respect to this hero.
---
You can bait Shelly and Darryl over a power box, they can't hit you but you can hit them because your attack pierces, and after a bit of hide and seek through power boxes throw your bats. They die, and you spin. Killed a Bull that way this morning. Spun so long a Leon and Crow came and spun on top of me.
---
Those are some GENEius plays there
---
A penny left by a Penny
---
Thanks! I know that. But this has been really annoying because my under 300 brawlers can meet at least one or two of them like every game.
---
Primo bull and frank are aggro
---
The drawing of the random though
---
Brain as small as face
---
Random player: *kills ninja and spins*
---
Ninja: stream sniping, supercell plz ban.
---
i once played with 2 franks in ball
---
i was also frank
---
I know but mayyybeee...
---
Oh I guess you're right.. me too
---
At this point I'm fine with the skin, but it just looks weird to see mortis cross-dressing. I think it's mostly the lipstick. Other than that, the attack animations are really cool.
---
Its a bit tricky to get boxes
---
You got that crow 500 and rip spike
---
Probably june 15, because that's when Supercell soft launched brawl stars in Canada in 2017, which is what the skin is meant to celebrate.
---
fuck Yay !
---
Reality is often disappointing...
---
"My calculations are always correct"
---
Lol so it really is true üòÇ
---
Leonel Primo? Sounds like a real name
---
No because it's higher than my number
---
You must be choosing going for the Shellys and Bulls over the squishy bois.
---
Yeah they always kick the ball when trying to attack
---
Rosa is rigged
---
What is this from
---
You won in sd sooooooooo???
---
GG fortnite
---
Oh
---
Oh how the turntables
---
Wrong weapon
---
Epic
---
Even though it's cool, I don't think that Brawl Stars should be on top there. I always question myself why people watch free games they could just download. No hate please, it's just my opinion. Clash Royale reached a lot of players watching streams but still I don't think that Mobile Games should take over Console/PC Games. BUT AS I SAID just my opinion. (I'm still waiting for -100 votes)
---
That's what I was thinking lol, this wasnt even that long ago ...
---
You realize this is going to get you banned, right?

No one cares

we all miss you;-;

Can some one tell me y this happens plz

wcr?

I like how the mod hasn‚Äôt been here yet

You fell for one of the classic blunders

Everyone has a different personality

Lol I felt like I did something good so I spun
---
I did, you just refuse to accept the truth.
---
I don‚Äôt want to see a new mike, but Brock used to look so much better.
---
Writing ... after anything makes it seem negative.
---
Consider the difference:
---
 Thanks!       or        Thanks...
---
This doesn't solve the problem
---
They call then that. There for the app store
---
...
---
It did
---
Reeee
---
Fornite bad me little child who cant thibk or function for himself so instead agrees with everyone else, me no likely fornite
---
We're not talking about you though
---
Because there is nothing to report
---
Good solution!
---
NOIIIIICE
---
You are F2P
---
Good idea. It doesn‚Äôt increase your trophy gain, but still makes it less frustrating to push. I‚Äôve been thinking about similar stuff like this, but your idea is pretty balanced.
---
Wrong format‚Ä¶
---
Well, I think I'm an expert coz I've been playibg for an year now.
---
Well think from a different perspective, when we‚Äôre 600 trophies there isn‚Äôt as many players searching at the same time  in the same area especially during weird times like during school time or late at night (just look at your local leaderboards). So matchmaking will take several minutes for us before finding a match with you or else we‚Äôll never get to play. Also because of this system you won‚Äôt match against 600s often since if there are multiple groups of 600s matching they‚Äôll play each other first.
---
This was probably done on purpose
---
Guys, the point is on the hat and the trophies
---
wait till u meet the guy with C6H12O6 in your game
---
Pretty balanced üòÖ
---
I have read some of you rolder post. I really think you have got some serious problems in your life and insulting everyone won‚Äôt make anything better. This is not meant to be insulting by the way. And seeing yourself as a victim isn‚Äôt going to help you, you should maybe self reflect sometimes.

Cheers,

have a nice day

This is the correct answer. Plus 1.

I love it!!!

lmao, I play Bibi at 400 cup range while still being power 6. The effort to unlock replays payed off, bit the rage and stress will never be forgotten

I know that el primo means the coising beacause I m from spain

They only ban people if they make supercell make less money. For ex. 2 player playing one acc.

You know it lol

Sometimes the searching is too long lol

I have a friend, that after I got a team kill with piper while landing **all of my shoots** ask me ‚Äúwhy didn‚Äôt you autoaim‚Äù
---
lmao, how do people even come up with these names? the most absurd one I've played with today was someone called JamesYoutubeYT
---
carl isn't robot
---
We need a reason to play!
---
If someone credit the original poster is not "stealing"
---
But it would also mean that more trophies are handed out then lost, and push the max trophy cap even higher. Would you be in favour of a bigger loss of trophies for those that die first? Or even a loss for making it to third or second with 0 kills?
---
Where?
---
you can play as a cactus tho? and it's cute, I see this as an absolute win for you (Rosa is not a bush, she doesn't count)
---
All those ranking mean is that OVERALL they‚Äôre not that great. Ever play brawl ball against 2 tanks and a good poco? It‚Äôs a nightmare. Piper has about 4-5 maps where she‚Äôs the meta. And she‚Äôs absurdly good if you‚Äôre good with her. 
---
Mortis has about 4-5 maps where he‚Äôs insane, especially in the right team comp. He‚Äôs got plenty more where he can be very good in the right team comp. The only people mortis has a really hard time with are Shelly, bull, Rosa. That‚Äôs it. Frank, primo, bibi, and Darryl are beatable if you‚Äôre smart and they‚Äôre not. And the rest of the cast isn‚Äôt that hard to beat 1v1 if you play well. He‚Äôs really good as is.

read this in carl's voice

if you are smart and they are too what happens ?

There is someone who It calls "Annie- Brawl Stars" in Rule 34

how about those memes made with mematic?
---
PRIMO NO!!!
---
You said it. Side note they should also delete robot. Only modifier that adds nothing
---
As a replacement to current? No thanks Mortis is already weak...
---
you juke....
---
They don't fit the game, and look worse imo, I really don't want any of them back (unless old rico will be improved).
---
Bo looked terrible and was the main thing people complained about over a year, now you want it back???
---
Thanks don I knew I could count on you
---
Hopefully
---
Oh shit
---
*Reality is often dissapointing*
---
This is so cool, good job there Gamma.
---
wasted opportunity
---
Thanks, I've corrected the typo and Brock's lines. But are you sure about Rico? Everyone keeps telling me he says different things! "You hacker" "You are a hacker", "Lying hacker"... I don't know what to put there üòÇüòÇ
---
Oof.
---
What do you mean?
---
No, Edited to make the lines in paint
---
&gt;they will add them back
---
They will probably *consider* it.
---
Now stop fishing for like without a screenshot of said email.

Supercell did these days a giveaway with this skin so you can have it for free and before it is officially launched

I love brawl ball I pushed almost all my brawlers to high trophies with bb only

I will give Credits to you dude on my new meme! Ok?

If you thing about it, there are so many young children here
---
In that case I am a kid
---
I'm losing trophies too.
---
Trying to get some trophies with DYNAMIKE, but there's always a fucking team in SOLO SHOWDOWN. Let's try DUO SHOWDOWN. Your teammate is going to have slow network, AFK, shoot randomly or auto-aim.
---
What's wrong with GEM GRAB? Those fucking minecarts start coming, a SHELLY and a BULL will jump in the middle and fuck up your game, nothing wrong.
---
HEIST or BOUNTY have the worse maps: those long-range brawlers start fucking shooting or those toxic throwers start spamming auto-aim button while your teammates spin continuously.
---
Fucking SIEGE game mode takes care of your huge amounts of trophies, it makes sure you don't get to the next rank. And BRAWL BALL, where your teammate catches the ball and, fucking spamming auto-aim, shoots the ball in your gate.
---
IM CALLING THE GENE GANG TO BRING BACK YOUR ASS BACK HERE!
---
*calus wants to know your location*
---
How do I push her, which modes and maps? And how do I play with her
---
HOW ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO WIN A GAME OF GEM GRAB ON THE MAP SPRING TRAP!?!?!?!?!
---
Because I am entitled to my own opinion and my own point of view. I'm not obligated to like/agree with anything.

Now stop gatekeeping.

How about no you fat sack of sh*t
---
Yes you are wrong siege is 10 times better than this garbage
---

---
*Mortis has entered the chat*
---
Yes thats why all top players push on siege while normal players hate it
---
Im 12
---
Me too! I'm glad I'm not the only one
---
I Wonder whats inside Darryls Barrel.
---
Actually it's horrible mode too
---
Brock
---
1. Slow projectiles
---
2. Low health
---
3. God awful reload speed
---
4. Auto aim is useless unless they are super close (won't matter though because your dead see #2)
---
I‚Äôve been playing like 3 months and they‚Äôve released 2 since I‚Äôve played. What‚Äôs the lie here?
---
I don‚Äôt quite believe that it‚Äôs Supercell‚Äôs issue, but go off, I suppose
---
Same I love siege and hate bb

Leon without his hoodie

No, it's Thank You Pewdiepie

At least there‚Äôs no stain on the apron

goodluck dood

How you got the skin?
---
Wow someone‚Äôs a little sensitive
---
Mmm. No. Your not as good as me because I watched YouTube more. /s

too late, I can already hear *ELLLLLLLL PRIMO!!!*

So basically this is my meme, what do you think of it? I obviously need to touch it up but still, I drew it in class sooo

---
Tons of my irl friends who aren‚Äôt close to maxed have quit brawl and moved back to clash royale and coc as well because brawl stars gameplay is boring. It‚Äôs not just high trophy players who are extremely bored, players of all trophy ranges are.
---
Still big yikes
---
What does that mean..it‚Äôs bad?
---
lmao, you'll get there fam, btw I only started playing this gane a week ago, didn't knew that reaching 400 with a brawler was this prestigous üòÖ
---
What if we make EVERY mode permanent? Only 2 extra slots
---
The eyes look like it's stealing my soul
---
It's just uncomfortable to look at
---
Where. Is. The. BIRD?!!
---
Mil
---
play *De javu* theme fam
---
Ok thank you, I‚Äôll definitely fix the eyes üëç
---
So basically if no one played hardcore then there would be no quality YouTube content, no chance for esports at all, and keep in mind that it‚Äôs the players with a maxed account and all 500s who are more likely to buy gems to get skins. But you‚Äôre saying that good players kill the game? What the fuck is that logic lmao
---
Well he needs something to boost his rank and also it can mix up the metal and make it more fun
---
I'm scared
---
miL
---
Lol...
---
One time i was so close to pish mortis to 500 I was pushing in siege, I was carrying my teammates I got all the siege bolts  but my teammates have done nothing to damage the siege ike so of course in the last siege they got more bolts and destroyed us I ended up being so mad I tilted to 380 now my mortis is at 506 but no thanks to siege
---
Well yes but actually....... ¬•‚Ç¨$
---
What
---
still don't see no maintinance break dammit!
---
oh crap its spinning
---
JK is one of the biggest brawl stars youtubers so he‚Äôs connected to other high trophy players in the game. He wouldn‚Äôt just make a post saying the game is dying if he didn‚Äôt think that it legitimately was. I for one agree with him
---
üÜí doggo
---
Yeet wp
---
Yeah thats a problem...
---
There is probably a solution but im too lazy to think about one lol
---
Lmao
---
I might be wrong but I always had this feeling that they have already implemented such a thing specially on 3v3 game modes.
---
Cool lol
---
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah.... ..
---
Sadly one of my favourite brawlers is not getting a buff.. and my ‚Ññ1 fav brawler is not getting a skin......
---
That's over sneak 9000
---
Sure
---
Yum food for mortis
---
Real talk though you‚Äôre an asshole if you smurf, let the new people learn!
---
Nice drawing but pls stop asking for upvotes
---
damn, he was just trying to joke, F to that poor man
---
I would swap piper and bull's star powers
---
üòä
---
So when have they listened to us? Because based on our feedback from the last update they haven‚Äôt listened to shit
---
piper installs aimbot and 2-shots leon
---
Why is this so funny and stupid? xd upvote ma boi
---
Back in nam
---
VERY NICE üëçüëå HOPE IT GETS ADDED
---
where is Penny?!?!1
---
I personally love ball and absolutely hate siege I don‚Äôt even try and get the token on siege anymore not worth it
---
She needs a freaking remodel 
---
And then you will say why is it taking time 
---
Because they have to keep it original as possible they can't copy they have a big reputation 
---
And whining will not help
---
Some kind of kindergarten THAT is.
---
For leon: he would only see when he become a hit or when he shot
---
For mortis: he has a longer range
---
For Crow: he do a poison trail when he jump
---
For colt: when colt was neaer on a other brawler he does more damage
---
For Jessy: he can drive with his towerüòÇ
---
For Rico: the same like colt
---
For barly: he would healed when he walk over is own poison field
---
I hope that this come in the next updateü§îüòäüëç
---
I didn't know vaulthunters play Brawl Stars.
---
Is it just me or do i think that this game is a non competetive mobile game made for fun and that this shit happens sometimes and its okay
---
You forgot about destiny streamers that passed tfue and ninja by views
---
When the Siege results screen says that Penny is the star player.
---
"We missed them" or something like that
---
Wtf no one wants them back
---

---
I have no idea what you‚Äôre trying to say

Maybe the OB players like me

as a semi F2Player, i can say that if you dont spend money, youre better off playing PUBGmobile or a non-p2w f2p

I‚Äôm sure they make you do better at EXCEL.

i lost it at the "TUNTUQKKDKDKKX"

"Who else misses the old Ricochet" or "Do you remember them"? something like that

honestly, this tier thing is getting out of hand.

what‚Äôs next? Tier List on Brawlers that will post lame stuff on Reddit?

Fuck that guy hope he dies
---
oMg ItS a TrAp BaRlEy Is MaLe

I can relate to this

Exactly. That works perfectly fine. You don‚Äôt have to ask for upvotes in the post. People will still upvote if it‚Äôs good content.
---
Yup
---
*Sad rhino noises*
---
Ok
---
But mortis is rarer
---
Hi glad you liked itüòâ, I'm dad.
---
Oh how the turn tables

Darryl

i hate both which point am i on
---
Eugenio
---
Jessie wtf were u thinking, bringing mortis to siege? Carl is smartest rn cuz u made suxh a fking big mistake
---
r/cursedimages
---
i for 3
---
agreed with the whole statement
---
So? Just because a brawler is rarer doesn't mean they can just use another brawler's mechanic willy-nilly. Each brawler is supposed to be unique. Carl's main mechanic would never work with any other brawler because it is super unique, and he's just a Super Rare.

It's called BM, and it feels damn good.
---
I didn't, it's from OJ's video, hence the player being OJ, and I didn't literally mean no one, I just mean almost every youtuber has it and not a single one of them seems to have noticed lol
---
can STILL win? He definitely iwns because he one shots shelly

Spike's  second star power could be life absorb when he hits one player with his main attack become he 100-500 heal mini spikes from the mini attack 100 and the main ball 500.

Oh.

My idea is that the one who makes the trade can choose the amount of powerpoints (there would be a limit tho)
---
Nah
---
What tf with Nita?

Wait. It wasn't Tim Royale, it was Tweenky.

oh no, just like dynamike, brock, mortis, and rico they have suffered the wrath of supercell.

You've never seen the meme the big chin bulky body?
---
Yeah I didn‚Äôt organize a team. I was playing randoms, but eventually the Leon and Spike (Yuheng) decided to stick around which helped out a lot
---
Damn how long were you looking at the CLOUDs
---
I only have ONEDRIVE left until I share this with everyone I know

Yea I looks on google, it‚Äôs the Picture of him with the Kairos Time logo in the background...his chin has a small bulgeü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Thanks, Ill take NOTE.
---
That is true. I just wanted to come up with some kind of way to get rid of the ten of thousands of coins high leveled people have. Maybe the gems could be changed to a different currency, or maybe a whole new thing that these high leveled players could obtain and put to good use.
---
Which country do you live in...
---
Then make it bigger wider stronger.
---
Oh my God do more this is beautiful
---
Yea for sure

"I'll use the stones to destroy the stones"
---
Who TF downvoted me?
---
Depends how many brawlers you have, their lvl and modes that you play. Ofc if all 26 brawlers lvl 10, than 10k range means that you are a bit retarded. But those who are far from being maxed and playing ONLY 3v3 (no solo sd), thats a good range. 
---
Best thing that evaluates skill I found so far is not amount of trophies, but rather set of 3:
---
1. LvL to trophy ratio
---
2. Average lvl of brawlers
---
3. How many games played in solo sd (more is worse)
---
Looks 3D üëç

Damn boah that's a thicc ass chin.
---
The difference in how much I play when BB is available compared to when it is not is massive. I wish we could see more stats for each game mode because I have 4,000 3v3 wins and I can assure you at least 3,000 alone are from BB. I want to know the exact amount though.
---
That is pretty balanced matchmaking tbh
---
Did anyone else find that hilarious? Sure it must have been annoying for the teammates but as a viewer that was hilarious.
---
I‚Äôm not saying whether or not he‚Äôs a good youtuber, I‚Äôm just saying that he‚Äôs respected and has a large fan base making him a big youtuber, though not the biggest.

they are both fun to use

Honestly does it really bother you that much?

Agree.

Santa (the red one) has infinite lives and each of the rebelling eves (the blue ones) only have one life. He must defeat them all before they destroy his presents.

Honestly, this is my first and only SC game that I play...buy I quickly get the impression that the team consists of like 10 guys trying their hardest to manage 3+ major games at once. They genuinely take forever to implement even the most basic changes. Not bashing as I completely get they are not a large company, but that alone is what is slowly pushing me away.

I like it!

No, you may get 78 upvotes

Whats the problem with solo sd? I like to rank up wins on there, about to hit 800 even. I see it as skill rather than wins in duo sd or 3v3 which could signify you get carried a lot and cant play on your own..

Hello :D

i dont think its the frank's first game of bb since it was clear that he was throwing the game
---
No just wrong
---
They badn ppl who break supercell ToS

Game throwing actually isn't on tjeir ToS so they don't ban

Account phishing, Inappropriate languages, etc will

Frank honestly needs a small buff. like perhaps a tiny less hesitation before attacking. he dies way too much for a tank
