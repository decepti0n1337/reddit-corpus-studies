You mean nerf her super‚Ä¶ (don‚Äôt include band-aid)
---
You have done well. Very good
---
 wow this is cool and proud that u found it
---
you forgot people complaining about emz bieng a vsco girl
---
this is a remarkable present u gave me
---
Maxed piper also does wonders.
---
Wow. Just noticed that!
---
Every time he says "time to brawl" I hear "time to bruhh"
---
Yeah but they don‚Äôt do shit... people don‚Äôt understand that a petition doesn‚Äôt force a company to do anything
---
All it does is show how much people want something done, a company can say ‚Äúif you get X signatures on a petition I‚Äôll do Y‚Äù but if the company never agreed your petition could have a million signatures and they wouldn‚Äôt have to do shit
---
Wow that sucks, I am at level 151 and I only bought the welcome and level 5 packs! Dang it.
---
How immature are you?
---
I really happy he got voice acting but it's just that the voice he has now doesn't fit his character at all
---
I expected him to have an mysterious or older voice. I just hope well get used to it.
---
Yeah. To be honest a lot of brawlers are better than Pam and Crow. It‚Äôs just those two are really overrated and overused, so people naturally assume he must be the best.
---
It‚Äôs like primo at sub 100 trophies. Everyone thinks he‚Äôs op, but he really isn‚Äôt.
---
I've seen plenty of worse subs, but i was able to forget some of them, but not all, anyway i wont link them, cause that's how i found them, someone linked them and my curious ass needs to click all links and to not be the dick which does the same i wont link them
---
a reference to TMZ?
---
Sry no.
---
It's great. Well done
---
If you get discounted token doublers tho which is the best value its 7 mega boxes &gt; 6 and 2 big
---
Maybe you‚Äôre bad, or not used to not regarding life without attacking
---
isn't it 2 early the event won't start until Saturday less than 3 day from now
---
hey look a dead figet spinner
---
Haha, if you enjoy it keep playing. Most of my brawlers are over leveled such that they only go up power level 10s as level 1-6s, so I‚Äôm just playing for star token.
---
is there gonna be an offer? on the store
---
Hey he was a lil weak ok?
---
Shovin a dirt block down ya throat,
---
Genius
---
Mine is at 500 now fortunately.
---
Doesn‚Äôt need a nerf, this was pretty situational. You got lucky they didn‚Äôt get rid of you first and you outplayed him.  Not every showdown is going to come down this close and everyone letting you live.
---
I played for five hours, I got used to paying attention to healing with attacks. I had 13500 trophies, so I'm not bad at the game. The mode is just flat-out awful.
---
Ghost mecha Crow 200k
---
Life leech solves bush camping /s
---
bro you posted Tick's dong, now you are going to get brock and ball tortured.
---
I can confirm that Spike with curved ball is OP, hitting even 1 thorn already puts you ahead of the opponent, because of the great curve that thorns make, it is also possible to hit barleys behind walls.
---
NOTE: I think Barley can get into Tier s too, with his healing star power he's very good
---
Betrayal
---
Check out some YouTube videos from brawlstar creators. Basically their are teams and whoever gets the most showdown wins in two days win. Kairos, Coach Cory, Lex, and OJ are some of the YouTubers that have teams.
---
I am excited that he did get a voice, but it's just it doesn't feel right for the character that everyone knew
---
heya chief pekka, hardwork pays off
---
Am i the only one who likes it?
---
how do u do the 8bit and emz star power merge
---
[deleted]
---
I like that he has a voice but it just it doesn't fit right for his character and it can get pretty annoying pretty quickly
---
Oh yeah, now I remember lmao. Can't wait for your next drawing dude, you've got talent
---
Bo and crow is also related to Joe
---
Very noice
---
Good thing he‚Äôs nerfed.
---
very balanced don't forget to put the pixel crux link so they can add it
---
It‚Äôs Carl‚Äôs hat since he spins with his super, &amp; Dynamike‚Äôs dynamite since he spins when he plays solo showdown
---
Where do you see this info page?
---
Not power drink that‚Äôs easy to backstab
---
No, more like a child laborer
---
yea I hope so, I guess the only thing stopping brawlers like Tara right now is the fact that she needs to get pretty close to do any damage
---
Bruh how the fuck y‚Äôall are too much
---
I really hope this makes it to hot, it‚Äôs so good!!
---
you just reawakened a dark part of my childhood, but man was it a great movie (a horror movie that was genuinely scary)
---
Uhh I think we should make it at around 2.5k at least but not over 3k
---
The fish get to travel. And bounce off walls. They could splatter on the wall and turn into fish bones when they bounce off. How much money would I pay for that?
---
LMAO more like Bo on a HOü§£ü§£
---
The trend is already dead and U are starting it again
---
It‚Äôs super cute :)
---
Where do you people make these artworks? Or how?
---
And of course you chose Brock
---
Damn mines at 16
---
KEEP LIFE LEECH
---
Big brain
---
Why is this true
---
8 seconds is too much it was balanced at 7. What they should buff is his damage a little
---
Holy fuck!? Someone‚Äôs been grinding... how do u play for so long wtf?!!!?
---
supercell understands culture
---
What is this graveyard shift?

Someone tell me please

Are there gonna be crossover skins for brawl stars anytime soon?

If we ignore his probable losses, since you gain 8 trophies per win, he must have won 127,5 matches. Since every match is around 2-3 minutes, we can confer that this guy spent 382 min playing, which makes it about 6 hours and a couple minutes of N O N S T O P P L A Y I N G
---
The problem is, I can just go and hide in the bushes and I‚Äôm guaranteed to turn a trophy profit. It doesn‚Äôt necessarily reward aggression
---
And delete lone star
---
Pretty sure it's a permanent skin!
---
We have a winner! Prepare for a huge influx of useless and stupid ‚Äúpetition‚Äù posts on here in the coming weeks.

The change to her shots looks amazing! Actually fits with the dragon knight skin now

So glad it's back, they better not touch it again or I'll be so pissed lol
---
sweat
---
Yes but I am just saying it sounds better I am not arguing for the name of the game mode
---
It's so good I dont understand why they removed it last time, they claim it was because of new players not understanding it but like how hard is it to read what the modifier is?
---
ah that could be it
---
I wish you could get gold
---
F in the chat for you. You couldn't make it in time :(
---
Honestly I enjoy takedown, maybe I'm just one of the weird few lol
---
Good idea but you can lie about you birthday
---
i suck ass and cant win but i like it i guess
---
Give it time! I know exactly what you mean. I expect in the next week or so that we will see more than just those few
---
Are there a specific amount of wins required?
---
yeah it is and frank is her boyfriend
---
sees dynamikes in the distance
---
The game would let you only enter your b-day once and like
---
It‚Äôs only once a year no matter what do it doesn‚Äôt really matter if someone lies-
---
I wish there‚Äôs a discount for this (when it appears in my shop) much like Shiba Nita when the skin is first introduced
---
Yeah the tara with healing shade needs to be fixed for sure
---
hi, just a fellow barrel boye passing bye
---
It's 40
---
Yeah that sounds good
---
Isn‚Äôt that one of Mirage‚Äôs lines from Apex?
---
Yeah I agree. The way he shouts Nita when he‚Äôs killed shows that he relies on her from time to time.
---
Legit question from a new f2p player, how did you already get her to Power 8???
---
What mode?
---
That dummy to your left decided to drag along his deadweight friend. That's not bad matchmaking, that's just a lack of foresight by SuperCell.
---
Yeah when I saw she was coming at 8k I started grinding but I wasn‚Äôt fast enough
---
If u keep dying to campers..
---
Why not just be one lol
---
Where did he say that?  I hope it's true ...
---
Try resetting your phone?
---
i‚Äôm so confused how you won with mortis in heist and a lvl 1 poco teamate and nita be the dps of the team

No just no i dont know if this is a bot whos talking to me but either way DONT consul me

yup agreed but currently it‚Äôs the only way to disable voices

*I said top to bottom*
---
Dude the reason why i hate shelly because her range is so long for a shotgun brawler and second her super chain
---
it is a pro gamer move
---
Yes, especially on more open lone star and showdown maps. In 3v3s, those 7 seconds come into play when you want to get in position against something like their gem carrier. Also, not all of those 7 seconds are spent chasing an opponent, sometimes you need to dodge while using your super as people can sometimes predict your path.
---
Woooooooo

Can‚Äôt wait to see the meta solidify (hopefully not all crows)

noice

I loved this voice line XD while i was playing leon in duo showdown, my teamate was a nita, and i was battling a crow and leon said "dont make me get nita!"and then when i died to that crow, leon yelled "NITA!!!"  And then my nita teamate came out of a bush and murderd that crow. It was hilarious!
---
she sweeps my team 44-0 in bounty
---
convrats,but you have no life
---
No, 8-bit. His rear was so still it looked like he was doing the downward dog
---
wait so if emz stays in the poison clouds in showdown then her hair gets better
---
Your makeup is SUPER good. A true bringer of doom, and not a mortal!
---
Your father is a bull?
---
Congratulations
---
I just wanted to say that after the update there are so many of those posts
---
When the game went global, suddenly the servers were flooded with new players, meaning most of us didn‚Äôt know the game well enough to be able to handle Life Leech. So, it was removed.
---
Now, the majority of the players (more or less) know what they‚Äôre doing (looking at you, Leon who bush-camped in brawl ball when two of the enemy team was down), and it‚Äôs a great mode with no real reason to stay gone. A few brand-new players don‚Äôt understand how it works still? Much less of a problem than a huge, huge percentage of all players not understanding it.
---
Like best showdown modifier so far it fixed even teaming
---
I love it! My only complaint is when people camp at showdown because they get the health advantage
---
You look sex pls show bobs and vegana &lt;3
---
Bruh
---
Omg, you're totally right.
---
well he would be right

Don‚Äôt forget the different usernames

Did you really just repost someone else‚Äôs screenshot even though that clearly isn‚Äôt you in it?

I like your cosplay, Cara Simon!

Woooo!

I‚Äôm vibrating
---
Why would you complain about it?!
---
Woooooooooooooooo!!!!!!! Because you can‚Äôt team to benefit you
---
Lol
---
If you do this, you a are a terrible person.
---
WoOoOoOo!! It's like old life leech: Fun, prevents teaming, and good for pushing in general. Hope it becomes pernament!
---
which one
---
get a job boy
---
many youtubers got a team . you have to join anyone of them ( you can join any). if a team gets 500 solo showdown wins between sat and mon , that youtuber  can give away 2 of each 5 new skins  to anyone they want.
---
Seriously how did this pass QA unless they purposely wanted it in lol

I'm at 17k trophies. If you can learn one thing, JUST ONE THING, you will win every 3v3 you play. STAY ALIVE. I know that seems obvious, but understand, that even if you are behind a wall, or are waiting for the right moment, whatever you do, JUST STAY ALIVE.
---
Its yde. What did we expect??
---
This should be added, I would legit enjoy it. It‚Äôs a shame that they can‚Äôt, because of bs being family friendly.
---
Actually it's effective lol. But yeah you're a terrible person as well if you did that
---
They don‚Äôt have different lines tho. I totally want different lines for mean girl Jessie.

Didn‚Äôt someone show gameplay of Beesniper and her super was Scrappy moving around?

Me too, after end a duo showdown, when I claiming, it suddenly say maintenance break
---
Did anybody else use barley during this before maintenance because he healed himself 100 heal each time you threw his bottle
---
Coz Corey is BIG BRAIN

That‚Äôs not all

---
That‚Äôs not all it got grindy just read what I wrote about ranks
---
Makes sense to me the line "hey Nita check this out" meant that Leon is trying to show her something
---
Wooo cuz it deals with teamers and makes it so people actually fight rather than camp
---
He doesnt need a buff. Just that nerf revert.
---
delete this shit
---
Gene, barley, poco and pam are the best in my opinion.
---
plus, all the other brawlers are bad and good in different mode, not only for poco, and whats the rank 30 thing about? I dont think you have any brawler above 600 if ur quitting because you cant play poco "a low tier brawler" in solo showdown
---
U look op lmao
---
I had 6 brawlers who where rank 20 and then when the rank 30 update happed I couldn‚Äôt keep them all up
---
Yeah but he has the lowest health in the game...
---
Me, probably. Idk, I don‚Äôt play much.
---
It's gonna die again
---
so toxic...
---
My shop offer was not working so i couldn‚Äôt buy it. I contact support and they have a maintenance straight after lmao.
---
We will see about that haha, at 10 am in my country, BS renews shop and modes. So its "a new day". I will see if i can get  XP then. But right now they do maintenance work so i cant get in.
---
Bruh and happy cake day
---
These Crows are just too OP
---
I like it...all of them!
---
Max exp. a day is 1050 I think,it's the games way of telling you to take a break,happens since global to me
---
They want your money soo much
---
Yes. 
---
Nah they need to increase trophy road to like 30k or 35k
---
Think I'll wait a year. Not worth the 150 to me
---
Such wow
---
And she fires out black cats in her super. It‚Äôs a really well designed skin. Very nice.
---
It will still cost 150 gems in a year
---
or moms
---
You did it
---
wdym couldnt keep them all up? You dont have to get all 6 brawlers to rank 30, it's not a requirement lol, its just so competetive players get something to do... you dont have to quit such an amazing game for that, it make literall 0 sense

But I found something more disappointing is a lot of players teaming in solo showdown and duo showdown therefore those who got bullied they loses the game and their trophies got demerit . I hope instead of losing and got demerit from the match, there is a system to analyze how hard that player had tried in the match. Calculating the player's statistic weekly and turn them into points to encouraging them. I wish this point can use it as gem, maybe 10000points = 1 gem. I hope Supercell don't let those players who got bullied disappointed.
---
I attempted to play Mortis, and it's just a bunch of Medical Barley hitting themselves.
---
i wish i had gems to buy the piper obe
---
Thanks for the info
---
lol
---
OwO Hewwo
---
So far mine is lol
---
Wooooooo
---
Bruh the honourable mention killed me, I laughed so hard lmaoo, please make more of these
---
petition to change his voice
---
Some people get it at 650, I didn't get it on 900
---
And I'm already tired of everyone posting it
---
WoOoO!
---
It‚Äôs really good value at 150 gems actually. I mean, relatively speaking. As 150 gem skin, there‚Äôs a lot of cool animations.
---
The one who asked
---
Yes that would be Awesome!
---
YES!
---
*sleeps*
---
Yes me too
---
Why is poco x piper here
---
Thank you very much
---
Life Leech
---
üòé
---
Its not an exclusive skin
---
u have a poco flair.
---
WHAT.
---
THE FU-
---
Thanks IcyTamTam
---
They could rename it back to Life Leech after Brawl O Ween
---
Emz is a new brawler, wth did you expect? That's not mode specific.
---
r/woosh
---
#r/leongang DECLARES WAR
---
Poor frank supers the corner out of frustration :(
---
I got it and it was super worth it. No regrets.
---
Yeah lol pushed Pam In 1 Hour from rank 15 to almost rank 21
---
you look like kairos
---
#YES
---
They can rename it back to Life Leech
---
Because GS is so cool and the ghost effect should stay too
---
I don't think they are having fun playing all Emz every game but okay.
---
Shoots her shells, at all sides. Blasts your face, all the time. Look out, here comes spider Shellyyyyy
---
Really cool, but the BikiniPamSknpls is just...
---
Is her skin limited?
---
Bs could add something to show the ally/allie hp when he is out of the screen too
---
This map is sooo goood i pushed leon there i give it 11/10
---
Thanks for sharing!
---
In twitter
---
Mortis with 1st star power op
---
I hope it is not temporary.
---
We don't get to see posts like this often on this sub, keep posting more of these lists
---
But is leon faster with his speed star power than before the 6sec buff? Anyone can do the math?
---
Photoshop: 100
---
idea is good but i'd say it should be 1 megabox + 100 gems instead
---
Wooboo
---
Not true, world record is around 60 gems from a mega, but yeah, if you are REALLY REALLY REALLY lucky, you can get Up to 120 gems
---
I think it‚Äôs limited because it‚Äôs a Halloween themed skin. Skins that come out in holidays usually only come out on holidays again (like Halloween 2019 and Halloween 2020). I could be wrong though.
---
u deserve an updoot
---
But is shark leon good
---
The problem is they must take damage (and heal their enemies) before they even get close, especially low bush map.
---
Hence, for Darryl, he might be weak before he destroy enemy as enemies steal health from him.
---
For others, they are having trouble getting Super too.
---
Looks cool. But cant wait to see Cory because mortis doesnt have beard but Cory do
---
U know thats not possible is just you two idiots think that it is possible but it will never happen
---
Thanks!
---
Sorry if I‚Äôm stupid.But what‚Äôs the glitch??Its something to do with the fps?
---
I can imagine Fisherman From Clash Royale Ending like him.
---
hot, Thats all I can say
---
Good to hear! I love when game devs have a little fun with their project.
---
There was another one.
---
i'm a she
---
When people still shoot the bot even if its immune
---
r/yes
---
If two people team and trade shots, they just make each other die faster. You lose 1/60 of your base HP every second, and heal 80% of the damage you do. Let's put a scenario involving 3 Crows.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
1 Crow who doesn't team, and 2 Crows who trade shots to "heal" each other.
---
The 1 Crow will die after 60 seconds. Let's say the 2 Crows only trade one full shot of 3 daggers.  They each deal 1792 damage to each other (including poison), and only heal 1435 damage, so they take 357 net damage. After doing some math, you would find out that both Crows survive for only 54 seconds after trading these shots, therefore placing below the Crow that didn't team. This would be true for all brawler teams -&gt; teaming is not viable and anyone who tries to team is just digging their own grave.
---
Say that 2 brawlers do team and don't attack each other. Let's put a scenario where a Gene and a Brock are both half-health (this is part-way through the match) and they're up against a Piper. 
---
Both can potentially get one-shot. The only way to ensure that doesn't happen is to kill the other to restore to full HP, or kill the Piper and restore HP. Realistically, Piper will hit one shot, let's say on Gene. What now? Gene is nearly dead. Clearly, Brock's only option is to kill Gene and restore to full HP to have a chance of winning; he's not going to allow Gene to hit him to heal up.
---
Life Leech/Graveyard Shift prevents teaming.
---
I really hate Mortis map, it make my poor phone explode
---
OML BRO I JUST-GJOUUNO YOURE SO NICE I
---
My question is, who's the mother of Emz if Frank was her dad? Surely she would have to have immense physical durability to survive Frank's monster.
---
Sorry i put this name because im am Brazilian and i forget It, sorry
---
I wanted Mortis, but I got Crow. I'm at almost 11k trophies and I still don't have Mortis. It hurts.
---
And stop Kamikazeing! Especially in heist. Rushing in for that small bit of damage just to die DOES NOT HELP!
---
I‚Äôm glad that I got all the mega boxes before they were replaced with brawlers...
---
I downvoted only cuz you said "please upvote".

Jojo reference?

Not you specifically! Unless you did camp. If you did, then yeah, bad person.

Who hurt you so badly when you were young?

But bunny penny, (released during Easter) wasn't limited

Have you been using him in Duo Showdown? If you acquire more than 50% of your trophies through Duo, you won‚Äôt show up there.
---
And she should hold hydro flask or crunchie on her hand
---
Wooooooooooooooooooo
---
I don't know
---
Ah! I Knew It! Emz is a Sans Fangirl!
---
~~And There's me, a Fisherman from Clash Royale Fangirl~~
---
Wooooo i love it
---
Needs to be permanent
---
But you died before they did.  All pets/turrets could theoretically stay in the game until the fog covers the entire map
---
At the end patrick should say: "i think i'll nerf leon"
---
Showdown
---
Yeah, I'm saving my stuff for Werewolf Leon and Calavera Piper
---
Your range should be 6 tiles

He said that is impossible, guys!!

My gosh, this is gatcha life level...

Is Leon raping Nita?

That‚Äôs a piece of candy

#Because screenshots are hard

I'm sad that Emz got no skin

Darryl sucks and sandy should be higher
---
The best game mode

Mostly solo graveyard shift, but I also played all the other modes to get the star tokens

---
Oof, dont have Leon either. Only Spike.
---
What?
---
I meant like as you asked " hope you liked it " I was replying to that as " I love it "

---
Crestine,a brawler that came from the future, has a normal walking speed and has a medium health range.
---
Her basic attack shoots a blast of arrows at a short wide range that does weak damage when uncharged(Shelly).To charge her attack,you would need to aim it for 2-3 seconds and when it's charged,it blasts the arrows in a straight line(Colt/8-bit) and bounces of enemies when they hit them(jessie) and ends with a blast radius on the third hit(Brock).
---
For Crestine's super,her pet robo eagle(Bagel) turns bigger and you can aim it at first.It pierces enemies(colt) and makes a wide turn back to them to attack them again,breaking walls in its path(most supers).If it hits the map's border,it stops and takes damage before swooping to enemies.When Bagel's health hits a certain(supposedly at half health),it stays in that position and shoots projectile bullets to enemies(Scrappy) until it is taken down.
---
Crestine's two star powers are "Enhanced Tech",Bagel needs less distance to turn around and has a wider attack, and "Precise aiming",time taken to charge her super is reduced.
---
1 lol
---
lol i was just taking a photo of my friend's screen
---
There there it‚Äôll be ok.
---
Also,if you wanna know the meme name,its Shenicobujeromiotib
---
with pam just get your super and camp
---
Congratulations!!! Spike is my first and only legendary
---
Yup, that‚Äôs the most likely explanation.
---
That's not photomontage dude, i've got this too
---
nooooo
---
Why are these not skins.
---
I should say all the game modes because Darryl suck at showdown in graveyard shift and sandy has a weak attack by nearby brawlers, Sorry
---
They're siblings Oof
---
Stinks
---
THIS exactly this is what I want BS
---
I LOVE it!
---
Not it‚Äôs not haha clash Royale made 7 billion in one year alone, just to basic maths and you‚Äôll see how much they made per day. Also that‚Äôs just one of their games. Oh, and source: literally google it
---
Same
---
Oh ok no problem
---
How many power points did you guys get in a game of takedown? My highest was 27. It's really easy with Rosa
---
welp yea i seen mortis, emz and frank in the same team when playing gem grab.
---
Crow hasn't been a top brawler for ages. Let him shine.
---
If he was the text would have said: Battling rather than Full
---
Also I knew he wasn‚Äôt playing, he was right beside me irl.
---
it looks like orange
---
Her stand is called„ÄåSuper Stacked„Äç!
---
Minecraft earth app be like
---
We don't know who they are (actually they're Russians) but we will find them and we will kill them
---
But making him op doesnt really make it better.
---
Bruh moment, I think Frank, the Game Dev, confirmed Frank and Emz are dating
---
I have attached a screenshot to the original post to clarify.
---
See how my Leon and the White Crow's power 10 colored circles underneath our brawler are just a normal blue and green throughout? Then look at Poco at the bottom or the Crow to the right and their power 10 circle has a yellow outline with a red brawl stars logo.

Good eyes indeed. üëÄ

Me personally I didn't care if he got a voice or no,t and if SC did give Leon a voice, that they would take their time.  I am grateful that he did get a voice it's just that it's not what we were hoping for and it doesn't fit his character, tha we as the community, has established.

He‚Äôs playing a solo event

Graveyard shift
---
yeah that's normal in duo Showdown . different teams have different colors below them .it would be difficult to see the brawlstars logo (sign of starpower) if colours were uniform so there is some contrast.its the colour of ground mixed with team  colour.
---
When you‚Äôre so high on your high horse that you have the audacity to complain that you don‚Äôt like the name supercell added to your map that they chose to add to the game
---
He‚Äôs queued in for solo showdown
---
Only 69 gems !
---
Bluestacks? Cool
---
*laughs in Loaded Rico, NMC, LMB, etc.*
---
Read other comments
---
That's what I thought at first too, I think it doesn't fit Shelly at all but the trying it out feels cute so I bought it.
---
The only problem is the fricking animation lol. It feels so chaotic when you finished a fight, her animation is so damn long too.
---
But if you want to join, he needs to change it to a duo or 3v3 event.
---
This is how it works in Brawl Stars.
---
For some reason, if he set the event to solo, you cant join him even if hes not currently playing.
---
Thanks, we just played Duo Graveyard Shift
---
Mortis?
---
Pipers in graveyard shift became annoying
---
The cringe is strong with this one, gee
---
Emz isnt op
---
no pls
---
HOW THE FUCK?!?!
---
it's actually better if you get a star power instead of a new brawler cause it increases the chances of getting a new brawler
---
"Teen"
---
nice but nerf the idea a bit
---
Have you changed the country? Bcs you need to play 1 match to get into rank
---
Sprays don‚Äôt contain CFCs though these days
---
WoOoooOoOOOOoOoooOoOOOOOooOOoooooOooooOoooooooooOooooooOooOooooOoo
---
The realistic detail is amazing! Fantastic Job!
---
Frank is Emz‚Äôs dad, Mortis is her uncle
---
I thought I was the only one person who remembered it
---
I am trying but they changed the fantasmagoric showdown map for another and now the maps are all bullsh*t for her  ._.
---
You won tho
---
how many trophies you got?
---
Is no one talking about the Piper skin?
---
Or poco
---
12,000
---
Ye
---
ü§£
---
My thoughts exactly
---
I mean, in this match no one did bad except from shelly who was afk for a while and me in this play. That spike was trully skilled and I just make a mistake wich seemed to me funny. I wrote the "complaining about teammates" line because of those who goes afk, don't pass the ball, etc, just trying to be funny and idk why I'm getting threated like an idiot.
---
I would. Worth the pain
---
Recently, I had my Tara's Shadow attack an enemy brawler and it survived with 1 HP.
---
She is now at lv22 and I put her to a rest
---
Ok this is terrific
---
I think the map should be smaller
---
You have: 
---
8867 Highest Trophies
---
8867 Current Trophies
---
1344 3v3 Wins
---
501 Solo Victories 
---
216 Duo Victories 
---
6m 9s Best Robo Rumble Time
---
2m 33s Best Time as Big Brawler
---
Your current highest Brawler is Nita with 541 Trophies.
---
Your last match was with Penny (at Level 7 with 314 Trophies) in Solo Showdown. You became 5th and Won +2 Trophies.

If you‚Äôre in one specific spot, yes. She‚Äôs really not op. At all.

its nulls.

They're a bunch of Russian kids who copied the tag from a youtuber.  That should answer all of your questions...especially the about the garbage

Thanks for support!

This is the most annoying part for me

She is only op if she hits you at the right range.
---
Nice drawing, a bit cursed tho
---
we had 2 brawlers that had skins as soon as they were released out of 9 (8bit and Sandy)
---
I guessed right but only in my head :(
---
Wouldn‚Äôt or couldn‚Äôt ?

Don‚Äôt whoosh me but they created her so they can picket her gender. I understand the joke but idk if you are sarcastic

Please reorient the video. It plays sideways

He still has a skin.

Don't get it xd

happy boi and angry boi

Booooo

He had a chance of being fine, shelly stepped on the pad early though.

XD
---
Its confirmed that its just a skin and NOT related to either poco or piper. Just a skin to celebrate day of the dead
---
That's why I don't like that this game mode breaks the healing mechanics

It was confirmed that spike will never get a voice

Thanks

Yeah
---
It is life leech

-Beta Player since week one
---
I dont see Mortis tho
---
Im more interested at tick's name
---
You also don't see the difference between blue and red wizard barley
---
On reddit i seen this 100 times and swiped a lot to find other type of posts
---
I would get this or werewolf Leon since they‚Äôre going to go away but the mortis skins won‚Äôt.
---
Depends on what brawler you like more, if you like Shelly even more than Leon, then take Witch Shelly, or Leons.(I think Leons new skin is cooler)
---
üòÇ
---
Here from the future. He has both.
---
You fucking killed her dude
---
Can someone explain what type of bs is this shield and when in appears
---
How do ypu check?
---
Colt, Pam, Jessie, and Leon. That‚Äôs it.
---
What about poco?
---
Whats the complete lossing animation
---
Wait,where is the map?
---
I need this skin in my life. I need Jason Bullhees now.
---
He made wrong, that‚Äôs why he learned
---
Cool jump dyna
---
What is wrong with this picture
---
did you see her star power
---
I BRING YOU THE GIFT OF DARKNESS
---
Yeees, we can clearly see the text thanks to the font.
---
He looks quite happy
---
Oh! Take my upwote
---
Yes. Yes they did
---
Why is your Star Power rate at 0?
---
Darn true
---
Happrns too often on me
---
She's loco for Poco, if you will.
---
I see that this update has something more to hide, for example that Siege got a new map look that was supposed to be only for SD and gem grab. Hmmmmm
---
E X P L A I N ! M E !
---
I am DumB
---
His hat is kinda broken
---
Please make this skin supercell!
---
This happens. This can happen with literally every brawler
---
I couldn‚Äôt find sad photo of poco he is too happy
---
F for Pam
---
Can you do my Canary Dizzy Please?
---
Me too man, but at 9k
---
i was thinking that the map will be added automatically to the post ahahahaha, wait i'm going to add the photo
---
Yes I know
---
Sorry was just suggesting other objects,since Jan damn thanks for the info
---
0 day old account guys
---
Hope they fix it... but hey,your map is great!!
---
only darryl, they said spike will never get a voice
---
It makes sense
---
No
---
Creepy but cool
---
Mortis x Piper sounds way better to me than Piper√óPoco.
---
Woa, Demolition got a buff on Shelly, not only 1000+ damage üòÇ
---
Ok so we‚Äôre just gonna ignore how Shelly is shooting fucking cats from a cannon like she‚Äôs not some schizophrenic psychopath who thinks she‚Äôs a witch?
---
Bug !?
---
I honestly never use crow because at far range he's good for marking in bushes and trying to stop healing, other than that his damage is worse than me just poking myself
---
Power cubes should have never been added to this gamemode. They should just make the boss health lower and remove the cubes. It would make it much more balanced to the people who die early since the people with all of the cubes end up being undefeatable.
---
Yes
---
when I try to buy resources I have no problems, only with welcome pack offer
---
No pls stop!!!
---
Both are good while I feel like werewolf leon has a better design, witch shelly has a better attack animation so choose what you want
---
It‚Äôs worth it. It really is top tier. I wasn‚Äôt sure what to expect with it but I‚Äôm just blown away by it.
---
NO that can't work out because it would ruin the fun for people who are trying to play IRL and there would be lots of complaints in SUPERCELL
---
and now matchmaking trys to find a brawler and trys to closely match anothers throphys, you just got unlucky :\\
---
Shelly is WAY more worth the price. Leon doesn‚Äôt appear to have nearly as much detail as Shelly. But you can always wait and see.
---
KrUmP bOi
---
That is not it fair at all to others
---
Is it just me or I accaualy bought it
---
KrRrRrRruUuUuUumMmMmMmP
---
Been waiting for somebody to do this forever... always asking my friends to do it XD 
---
Glad somebody actually thought of this skin and drew it!
---
I am ze √úbermensch!
---
Oh no üò≠
---
Yeah On. Lun ar,  frank said they would either remodel pam or darryl
---
Wait, new Takedown? Damn
---
i lost braincells reading this
---
Yep. They're both overpowered
---
Ugly voice too
---
its so good that you gots to keep it
---
Removed. Keep your post titles descriptive and provide context. Additionally do not use low effort/all caps/clickbait titles.
---
Well techically they are brother and sister so they are already shipped
---
HAPPY CAKE DAY LOLLLLLL
---
Dude she's only t-posing for power over the other brawlers
---
Shut up
---
I will still hug spike
---
Congrats dude at your trophy count you deserve it üëç
---
Yeah guys, they‚Äôre silibilings, but there‚Äôs nothing romantic about this! C‚Äômom
---
No im not gona do that i know i cant get 500 show down wins if i tride that my trophies will go to zero XD
---
This is the most relatable post o have ever seen
---
Invidiheal is actually really good now. 6000 HP can it heal
---
A player on here told me just to focus on the bot not the other players and I've done that and I've got a hell of a lot better than I was doing before back twice I won so I can't complain
---
Red + yellow = orange. It‚Äôs night, which is why it‚Äôs darker tone. What point does that prove? &lt;_&lt;
---
What's up my beta bro
---
It would shoot extremely slippery bananas
---
Its working thanks
---
I appreciate the offer! :) but I like trying to build my own.
---
Until you realize half his skin is literally hanging
---
agree
---
I want this cuz I'm level 210 beta player
---
The problem is when you only focus on the bot all the other players will target you and you'll end up dying :(
---
No entiendo, ¬øme explican?
---
Frank said that Brawlidays, Brawl-oo-ween and Chinese New Year skins are not exclusive anymore. They will be on the shop every year.
---
This Crow was really bad. Who the fuck would dive on Super ready Piper? The Crow should've see this coming.

Exactly 30, i also thought it would need more and had 260 boxes saved up, but i already got him in the 30th box and also had enough boxes to max him. I would have thought atleast 100-150 boxes, but nope just 30, also when gene came out, i also had a few hundred normal boxes and some big boxes saved up, but at the time i still had 3 mega boxes from the trophy road saved up too, i thought let's use the trophy road boxes first and the first mega box gave me gene and i was like, "well that was a fast box opening, looks like i have to save the hundreds of boxes for the next brawler"

I hope you can build your kingdom :)

Huh.

Visually, I agree. Life Leech was balanced a bit differently though (only recovered 50% of damage dealt, healing star powers were both fewer and less effective) and I like Graveyard Shift better in that regard.

Sorry should have added /s

Ah thank god you were sarcastic, there are too many people posting the same thing over and over again, after the first few posts, most have seen it and the next time it's posted, it doesn't get upvoted and dies in new, but when browsing new, you see the same thing many times in a row

Ok piper calavara skin color is bright yellow. If it was in a darker environment it would still be the noticebly yellow. My argument is that I would be a lighter shade. Your argument is that it would be a darker shade. Since you say the for is red that makes it more inprobable that the lighting is the reason of her skin color. So it makes my case stronger.
