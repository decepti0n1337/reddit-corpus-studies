It‚Äôs probably over, but I want to ask anyways. When did you and Kairos become good friends? Was it before or after you became YouTubers?
---
Don't call my girls thots. EMZ is one though
---
We got mega box and coins so far
---
Another post with the same think
---
no :[
---
Brawl Stars is so easy to grind trophy. Just use low trophy brawler. 30 brawlers to 500 trophies is 15000 trophy. While Clash is just 1 deck you can play at a time making it harder. Its not about fun or boring. It's about how the game system is created.
---
You could be making the right call. Once you get in the 300+ gems area you get from boxes you can buy legendary brawlers when the offers come.
---
I believe it is in order of preference
---
Art copilation for get karma

what dose neat mean ?
---
No it won't

Without a 3D rendered model, its much more work to make skins

Nope not this time

Cute

With a yeti brawler that can roll snowballs that catch any enemy brawler that's hit and releases and slows them down when it reaches max range

Tell me about it. Sandy came to my shop for 519 today... I have 224.

Cool

Nice

Who'd draw pirates and not include a kraken?
---
No, I'm the guy who dies right before this.
---
This might be true. I saw brawler ranking and a tier list. Many people probably think it's a meta tierlist. Jessie actually fit S-tier and so it felt even more like a meta list
---
Still very cool art tho!

Day 30 : Power Play for everybody
---
F
---
Counter-counterpoint, Power ‚Äú11‚Äù brawlers are more versatile and better equipped for different maps and gamemodes
---
hurB
---
It's not that low but most people should be able to push their brawlers to 500 trophies easily at power level 10
---
Day 31: Power Play has a Star Token!
---
You a slave to a page in my rhyme book
---
nop, 
---
Fr√≠o means Cold
---
But in Spanish "El Snowman" translates as "El mu√±eco de nieve"
---
Alot of people have said this but think about it
---
If they release a limited skin for a legendary brawler that most people dont have then theres gonna be alotta hate
---
B
---
Counter-counter-counterpoint, that doesn't matter on an individual map. Power 10 using the same star power as the power 11 would be the exact same
---
brawlidad xd

Oh this is not cool! But Frio is cool! I will post it this will  name

I would love a smaller kraken like brawler

Neat

Doesnt mater how good you are when you have to 3vs2 or 3vs1 your enemies because of:
---
-afk randoms
---
-randoms who pick a terrible brawler for that mode/map and are also trash at them
---
-one trick randoms who are at 3k total trophies with only 1 brawler at 600 for example
---
-randoms who play with their 0-trophy level 1 friend (this one happens the most to me)
---
-randoms who like to throw the game on purpose (getting killed in the last seconds in bounty, scoring own goals, dying with the gems, missing an unnecessary trickshot because they wanted to look cool)
---
-randoms who are just shit and die/auto aim/feed supers all the time
---
Uhh hes just saying that dumpling darryl should be higher than meh

How do you get leon or flair

I sure hope so

Do you know what is in the update as of now?

At least they gave us 100 coins tho

gene is nice
---
You don't get more per day, you can just collect more per day, there is like 30 tiers in total and the season lasts 30 days so its still 1 chest per day but you can collect them early. Do you even play cr?
---
It's Barley, look his eye
---
OP enemy team completely due to playing with randoms, crashing (for older devices)
---
No u do get any trophies if u win afk.
---
Oh, ok. Sorry
---
True, but I hadn‚Äôt gotten a legendary brawler in ages, so maybe increase it by a little
---
how much time it takes to play a game that isnt showdown takedown or lone star when the new brawler is a trophy road brawler
---
The only tier list that can replace the feet one
---
Ikalgo gene
---
Emz will not like this
---
Would be cool lol
---
Bruh, it has the marks because the paper was literally attached to the brick.

imagine if he really comes. i would like if he had a special ability like bibi homerun but with his you could walk through water

You‚Äôre literally at lv 39 with 3.1k trophies while your friend is at lv 90 and above 10k your friend plays more than you so clearly he‚Äôs gonna get a legendary earlier
---
You've been playing for over an year but you have level 9/10s under rank 20? That's pretty low in my opinion but yet your still complaining about the lack of your star powers?
---
Im not your friend, mate.
---
i got crow like that
---
Ahegao Piper
---
he aint using the super lol
---
don't worry, its probably just a plushie!
---
its too small anyways.
---
Why did people congratulate them then?

r/shittybrawlstars
---
Not gonna lie i agree with the meme it was so useless for me sense i am maxed out
---
You are right, it may be true
---
We will never know
---
Dude, I just said I wasn‚Äôt complaining
---
I don‚Äôt give a shit if the next reward was 10 coins or 1000 coins, I‚Äôm just saying they should‚Äôve built up hype instead of put all their cards on the table first and foremost
---
That's alot of trophies
---
Noiice

The worst tier list i have ever seen!Everything is wrong

This doesn't even looked like bull's diner, im guessing that this could be the western environment

Its called revenge

[deleted]
---
Yes a!mazing!
---
Have y'all forgotten the damage leon was able to output? He could take out primo in like 2 shots close up
---
Nope, only new textures and minor changes
---
I beg to differ I got a lot of trophies on both and they I would say Clash Royale is harder especially if you are free2play since even at lower trophies in leagues you'll find super over leveled player

Plot Twist:
---
Supercell is doing the updates with the Kairos map. ( Graveyard and now Pirate Ship)
---
Same I'm free to play and when I got to 14000 trophies I also only had 26 brawlers, and I only started playing this game this year. I know how hard it is to keep grinding.
---
But how to use brawler flair

*scared 8bit noises

From Dying for Bull to Shelly

Thank you

Everyone wants coins to upgrade brawlers.

Bruh this is so inaccurate

Rosa for sure. It was nuts.

Why are you complaining about coins?

Lol it's a easy fix just click this YouTube link:https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ

Who said that? please read two of my comments (which are very shallow in this comment madness) I

I don't know cause it really don't look like gene or pirate gene

thanks...üòá

I mean at least as soon as you unlock sandy you can get him to max and buy his star powers

I‚Äôm not your buddy, comrade.

Wow really nice art

Hey Lex! I just want to say have an amazing day/night! üëç

o fugni got epiced
---
Your chance is so high
---
Honestly just stupid
---
I got Mortis and Gene before the Epics, and didn't get Darryl until almost 5k, but finally got Pam, who was followed by Spike. Didn't get the other 3 epics until 8k. Spike is... Well, I hate his crappy health, but damage is good. Currently got all brawlers but the missing 3 legendaries. Hoping for Crow, but the other 2 are ok as well.
---
May be it's about the update is coming
---
Its a joke

Tick is good as it is

Yeah it does, the angle is off

I only have sandy and he is basicaly pocho with shorter and faster attack,but the super is good

No

I think shocked and annoyed should be switched

He's like your cute chibi Spike.

Last match, I got matched with a 300 trophy Bibi while I had 800 trophy Colt on Dune Drift (Long range map)

Darryl: why not both?

Good idea because in Zooba it exits emojis (sorry for bad english I‚Äôm romanian

looks more like Tick arms

Don't get too hyped

Oh hey, didn't recognize you. Love your memes and drawings/comic!

That's awesome if you're missing a brawler or want a starpower i hope you get it because i saved like 270 regular boxes and like 25 big boxed and i got sandy the night he was released and posted it
---
Thanks!
---
They said the third star powers in game was ideas that aren‚Äôt good (op or up) so they keep it in the files, doesn‚Äôt mean they will release a 3rd wave of star powers, sadly
---
so uh, on the right is a widget for this sub, it should also say joined and 'create post'
---
underneath that is community options
---
expand it, you should see user flair
---
click edit and choose your brawler :D
---
Now im making shelly
---
yeah but the catch is that either A. They straight up say no or B. They say ‚ÄúOh it‚Äôs such a good idea‚Äù and then make up a bullshit excuse saying why they can‚Äôt (won‚Äôt) do it.
---
DJ Khaled Suffering From Success
---
Hahaha yeah, but I will buy if, because last brawlers I getting for free and I have the enough amount to buy only if is a mythic/epic etc, and the boxes will help me to get him/her to level 10
---
Rosa
---
And that's a fact
---
I meant star points lol
---
Nice strategy
---
:3 so what did you actuall get? A Shelly ? XD
---
Then you should work on your skill. What you're doing wrong. Even if you played good you can still mess it up by not bringing a brawler with carrying potential.
---
What about TimTeemo Brawl Stars Memes?

Wrong, it was 3 shots.

Dividing the total (5) by the percent (175%). Think of it how if you divide a larger number ( 175%) by a smaller number (5), you get a number that is equal to the if you were to do the equation normally. Sorry I‚Äôm confusing you but that‚Äôs basically the gist of it.

I stamp all of y'all are kids. A theme isn't just based on what the brawler looks like. El primo is part of the Wild West theme and so is barley; Rico, 8-Bit and Brock are part of the same retropolis theme as Bull and the others except they're not bad.

When i see bs i think of "bullshit" lol

 Dynas bird is best

Alright bet

BRUTALITY#
---
Yes they do
---
Generally, putting a turret in a corner like that makes the turret shoot the wall quite a lot of the time, especially if an enemy is to the left of the turret. It‚Äôs super easy for long range brawlers to shoot it from a distance without getting hit, and it‚Äôs super easy for short range brawlers to get close because of how close it is to a wall. This is a bad turret spot...

Be patient -_- it takes time for it to appear

---
Your timing is bad : don't go for power cubes when the shield is off, go for the robot.  Go for the power cubes only when the shield is on. Every second counts and the 3 - 4 seconds you lost getting that third power cube is your mistake. You could have shot the robots 3 times before the shield went on again, even avoiding that Jessie in between.

If I was the bibi I will just take another path so that I don't have to fight the shelly because there's a very high chance of dying and wasting time

Primo in Western, 8 bit in robot
---
Im the bad guy
---
Maybe club wars? 2 clubs compete in a trophy push and whichever club gains more trophies steals the box from the other club
---
Im completely aware supercell said that Club wars are not a priority however it would be a cool idea
---
Youtube, brawl stars just released a new animation video
---
Dyna‚Äôs bird is a canary
---
But in brawl stars case , Darryl and penny knew that colt was there
---
good point! agree totally with you
---
nice eyes
---
They are cool, but Colt and Carl already have a lot of skins
---
P.S. Sorry for the screen color, I have to turn on my eye protection mode so it doesn't hurt my eyes that much while playing at late nights
---
Tbh this is maybe a bit too much maybe no golden tooth and the red headband and then it would be perfect imo
---
8-bit is MAYBE from the bad guys theme
---
That's... That's not a guitar
---
Supercell makes video
---
This sub already think of memes and formats:im speed

I plan on buying this skin

Thats a broom

No please Mortis with coiled snake in lone star
---
new look on the brawl boxes? (brawl box has eyepatch)
---
It‚Äôs ok just don‚Äôt make the same mistake
---
Whatever maybe it's poco just sayin it might not
---
Too big... if your going to have an attack that requires teamwork in order to do 6000 damage in 3 seconds... 4 ships seams unlikely and everyone will end up staying on just one ship and move as a team if that one begins to sink. Also brawlers with a short ranged attack are at a huge disadvantage unless you were to add some sort of stun after he slams his tentacle down in the middle it would stay there for awhile ü§î. Needs a lot of work but a good concept
---
14000k bro? 14000x1000? U meant 14k haha
---
So we definetly are getting Pirate Colt and Pirate rock
---
"Keep playing until you lose" lmao
---
Also this perfectly applies to every other online character driven videogame out there like League or Overwatch.
---
Ur lucky

Just cuz u made a pirate carl skin doesnt mean that they got it from you.

the idea is kinda simple

Nah, El Primo look very friendly, maybe is Bull Asgore

Its not a new brawler

I like the first naruto episode and the dev team animation reference

Its free?

That's a REAL circlejerk for you guys :\^)

Atleast some tick power points ;D
---
Pirates gene is already in the game
---
Dont u just hate it when u get tick‚Äôs head
---
Not really as both are different
---
That‚Äôs kinda ungrateful
---
i know
---
noice
---
It was there already
---
Congrats dude!
---
There only 2 with more than 4 skins
---
1. Barley
---
2. Brock
---
thanks you couldve sent the link to youtube
---
Lets hope brawl stars doesnt end up like fortnite(everyone to hate it and being the most hated game)
---
This is from world finals there is a lot of easter eggs about this
---
√â poco seu loco
---
Last year I didn't have enough gems to buy Red nose Nita ( F2P btw) and I liked Dyna more than penny so I ended up buying this
---
tara be like
---
The Expert
---
That wasn‚Äôt confirmed, would have been better if his legs were in a ship
---
For example Barely has 6
---
Carl is the best!
---
It‚Äôs a big box
---
Ransoms when you attack them: 
---
******I HAVE BEEN SUMMONED******
---
are you a boomer?
---
What kind of ‚Äúparty‚Äù have we stumbled upon today
---
I think the poco, colt and Carl are the new skin
---
^ subjective
---
You did it after that didnt u
---
its called "smearing" its a animation technique
---
HaliüôÉ V√©gre magyar
---
‚ÄùOne of the biggest‚Äù
---
There still gonna be one big suprise, assuming last day (24th)
---
CARL LEGS!!!
---
Bugs
---
Yeah hahaha
---
After the 4/4 mythic,chance would be higher.
---
Wonder what the new brawler gonna be? Another pirate maybe?
---
*frank super has now activated*
---
Im at 17k trophies and 1k Colt matched up with a 3k trophies and 800 Crow
---
Mortis's bats!?
---
Yo they better give us those skins
---
bro i don't even have piper
---
its printed lol
---
We should probably name him
---
??? maybe is brawl stars world finals trophy?
---
Omgod no
---
I know the link and can't be trapped
---
Bro...
---
wow
---
Yes.
---
I feel you man, i haven't gotten a new brawler since july. And yeah, sandy would be really nice
---
why u compare this with voting for trump lmao
---
im back from the future
---
That is similar enough to the trophy level difference. That also causes people to blame matchmaking.
---
your post sucks
---
#Tameplates
---
grats
---
Yes, someone posted game files of 3rd star power for like 10 brawlers, I don't know when they are going to implement them or if they are going to be implemented at all.
---
May I ask since when you are playing? and if you have bought gems or no? I feel kinda struggling, I max out a brawler each 2 - 3 week.
---
Shelly actually does fairly good, but bibi on the other hand....
---
outstanding move
---
Im like Penny when stealing the 10 gem carriers
---
Excuse me what the frick
---
The game sucks because there isnt much to learn expect how to move a joystick over peoples heads. 
---
Brawlers need more then 2 abilities otherwise the game becomes stale and dead. Adding more star powers was an ok idea but it still means new players went have a fun experience once they learn how to play the first brawlers effectively.
---
Braw Star barrel
---
Spike kinda thicc
---
No boss fight mtachmaking is same matchmaking other modes i got insane 2 with randoms as 700+jessie
---
That‚Äôs the case even for Dynamikes that don‚Äôt team (like myself), we just think the name is fitting and she/he likes the head rush (For my Dizzy, she prefers It only on rare occasions, and I respect my birdie‚Äôs opinions)
---
What was your trophy coubt for that beawler?
---
r/eyebleach
---
I hope it is
---
Ooooo, I like that!
---
What do you mean?
---
oof lucky, very lucky
---
Nope, it always drops. The higher the rarity of the brawler you find, the more it drops.
---
The thing is that brawl stars drawed this
---
show must go on
---
WHATS THIS BRAWL STARS POST? VIDEO? YT?
---
just kairos and his guesses
---
I see a man of culture I see. So she has a chicken and a cat. Cat can be Lucky (ironic) and the chicken could be... Clucks?
---
i play this game like 14 hours a day
---
Big box
---
*le respawn*
---
I didn't spend a single dollar, just been playing since the start of beta. Brawlers were really easy to max back then not to mention the free perks we got each time they changed the system around how to level brawlers. We got lucky
---
nice idea but hard to balance
---
That‚Äôs the breed of bird
---
Oh ok. Thanks
---
the update is on wednesday epic gamers
---
You are a random too if you have 700+trophies randoms are good and if you have a good trophy count for that brawler you will be natched with 700+players wich is good
---
Yes
---
Hank
---
you give me anxiety. i give you an upvote.
---
please. stop.
---
You are 2 months late and the teaser animation is already out
---
Bibi is a child
---
Flappy
---
There is almost no correlation. Only that both carls are pirates
---
I have the same drop rate bro, I feel you!
---
Dizzy?
---
Perfection
---
We‚Äôll surprise you with one
---
Oops I just loaded up the game, yep it‚Äôs confirmed
---
Lol no she is 18 at least
---
No its just tick
---
Boss got so angry, he glitched the entire game.
---
Me not
---
r/beetjuicing
---
Tick definitely got the star player in that match
---
Sponge bob Island, funny because it‚Äôs not even that OG
---
The concept itself though
---
More brawlers doesn‚Äôt mean higher chances if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre saying
---
Yes it does. IF I open the new brawler that probably will be mythic before my first legendary, the drop rate will decrease dramatically.
---
It's the normal big box which is already ingame
---
Imagine 10 yellow sniper try to murder you while you just got lasered by the boss
---
I just got Sandy but I still don't have spike or Leon, I am waiting to have 50-100 boxes before playing her, so I can get at least lvl 9. But I feel uneasy, I don't know if I am happy that I have sandy or sad that I don't have spike or leon.
---
Love it but penny hands tho...
---
Dude you literally used the same format with just a small change. How low effort can you get
---
it's the spongebob island
---
I am at 700+jessie w/randoms
---
maybe they are friends and they made a team
---
Moderate
---
^no one cares
---
bruh no she is literally as tall as jessie
---
Colt and Carl were working for Gene
---
CARL LEGS!!!!
---
Nice meme
---
So you are saying all short people are young?
---
This scene made me laugh
---
That guy should be skiled
---
It‚Äôs just a big box with a pirate patch on it people, calm down
---
CARL LEGS!!
---
Repost
---
I know why u wrote supersell because supercell is going to bring a SUPER SALE
---
For skins
---
thats cool
---
Could be Skins for a Battelpass.
---
I think a wvent box. This box can be warking similar as a roulette:
---
50% for coins
---
10% for gems
---
A minimal chance for brawler
---
Etc.
---
They never give credit
---
Is today's power play
---
That first image is just from kairos‚Äôs map it‚Äôs not a supercell released image
---
No lol
---
Are u saying penny owns Darryl and tick?
---
If its poco and emz can we call them pez
---
u/Frank_Supercell u/Ryan_Supercell u/Dani_Supercell
---
There is another post about their skin and how they think that Supercell stole the Idea. Even though it barely resembles the new carl.
---
At least your skin looks like the new Version and you thought that supercell was inspired by that not that they stole it.
---
She already has a voice, only brawler in Supercell's list to give a voice is Darryl. In my opinion, they deserve same attention now. I hope BS Team will make Darryl&amp;Pam  both happy in one update
---
No it doesn't
---
yea I think so. tbh your art can be better
---
r/lostredditors
---
Mabey you can only get skins in it
---
A mythic is a lot better than a legy. Change my mind.
---
Dude you have an eye of cthulhu
---
I don't think so
---
Boom :)
---
Any of them can turn invisible?
---
Nice done mate
---
yeah
---
That sub shouldn't exsist anymore since they added an update where it shows the icon of the sub
---
You aren't saying An opinion. You are correcting mine saying im wrong and that the guy's i mentioned art is not more alike the new skin. Stupid Moron...
---
You called?
---
HAT SIMULATOR TWO
---
She was once stranded at the Brawltopia beach. She didn't have any friends. She met Jessie who taught her in robotics. Back on the sea she build Darryl. A cluncy robot. Later she build the more complex robot Tick. This is my backstory for her.

Everyone ha as posted this
---
**respawns after match was long done**
---
i think it's a holiday box that would be available only through the holiday month, that's why they increased the gap between the boxes so they could fit another one.
---
Could just be a reskin of the normal Brawl Box
---
Oh :(
---
Tara uses uno's cards
---
I hate when that happens
---
Yeah maybe
---
Dead for alive
---
For use super in Tick

Also it is just a big box

Fake, they turned off DM. That means only they can send you private message.

He is  Frienemies  with himself.

Spinel cursed images be like:

Ok
---
I have 1 power 7 brawler, 9 power 6 brawlers, and 2 power 5 brawlers (11 brawlers in total) I can upgrade to power 9, but I lack the gold... I think gold isn't obsolete to me.

Didn't someone already do this ü§¶

I remember this as an idea in this sub

There have been a week ago

So did i

Rico and dyna on the last

Finally someone who knows

ive actually had that glitch in bounty before last year. weird...

But the pickaxe isn‚Äôt the same? Lol. His is what looks like a grappling hook and Supercell made it an anchor

It‚Äôs cool, but give credit you thief!

LOL my brother has two legendaries at 5000 trophies and I have 0 at 9000. We are both Free 2 Play
---
What if u haven't unlocked coins yet
---
Im 10 and its really like DAT
---
I mean they're not crediting him (as usual) I dont know if he should. Its a cool thing to see, but it'd be nice if supercell acknowledged this.
---
These are locations, not themes, but whatever
---
What about that line crossing through the eye...?
---
They did on the box like on the youtube logo
---
So true
---
Judging by the fact I haven‚Äôt seen any of these maps before I‚Äôm gonna guess they‚Äôre all yours
---
It's really cool, but I don't get why you made her legs really revealing. You could've given her shorts, or even a skirt. It is really cold after all.
---
Its amazing
---
This is so cool! Just....underrated.
---
Killer queen has already touched that treasure
---
the last map enter the dyna madness

Downvoting who?
---
Also, the people who unironically like brawl ball.
---
If it inspired super cell they would have messaged him saying if it was ok to take idea and maybe reward him
---
It happened to me
---
free stuff is free stuff
---
Would have preferred something other than tickets
---
no it's not, it may be a new special box for seasonal events there's a blank space between boxes and the mode selection tab
---
looking at his karma, probably, plus I think the real frank is u/Frank_Supercell
---
Still 3v3. But maybe we will see a new gamemode in which you have to get the chest, like a Capture the Flag
---
I have never agreed to something more in my life
---
Yes, and it has been there for 2 months. I think they made the box smaller so you dont open them by accident
---
Only veterans know Carl have legs
---
Y u do this
---
The pirate colt looks really dope
---
Very late

From the begging Carl have legs, look

Just not my cup of tea man. I was so disappointed when they didn‚Äôt add the swamp gene skin that they teased in one of the brawloween videos. Hopefully they‚Äôll add that or a cool gene skin soon. Fingers crossed!

Then don't complain about crashes. It's so simple

Let‚Äôs hope at least

Right? That WgXcQ haunts me.

F2P here, I have played for about 5 months after I got the game during global release, and I have 29 brawlers. Getting the brawlers is based on luck, and the game is great as is. The only thing you want is club wars, which a few people would agree with, but if you don't get what you want, others lose a fantastic game? Respectfully, BRUH
---
r/beatmetoit

Pretty sure it doesn't
---
are u trollin lmao? its obviously el primo
---
leon seems like the type of person who would just watch and enjoy the show while two people are fighting

Its soooooo easy to get literally any brawler to 500 these days.
---
Please can you make and share a post i did yesterday the post is called Ideas for the next Brawl  talk part 3, with that ypu help me a lot.üòÄ
---
Thanks dude, btw email was good I got 5 different mails all with the same code haha, and again thanks man.
---
Tick always had both pirate legs lol
---
I'm afraid I will get Tick-abetes.
---
This is really good
---
Tick's head is tick's head, it isn't?
---
You can mute them now
---
Its not that useless. If you are really lucky and skilled. You can beat the box 6 times. Which is equal to 330 tokens. So 3 boxes (well its not too much...) Back then there were only brawl boxes for the duration of brawildays.
---
in iran it will be either around 12:00 or 15:30

Lamp should be named Thomas

---
You're so creative
---
I know... Maybe new skin for pam?
---
Ikr so sad
---
Nah
---
darryl's hat logo, means he is the captain of the ship
---
As a person who has paid the game more than I‚Äôll ever admit to anyone, I think it‚Äôs totally great for people to complain. I mean I have all brawlers and have only been playing for like 80 days. But I know some have played for like a year and have some missing or no leggys. So I definitely understand the frustration. I‚Äôm super impatient. 
---
All these boot lickers hating on people sharing their dissatisfaction need to just stop. How much is supercell paying you guys to defend them? Take your own advice and don‚Äôt complain that someone else is complaining. Corporations don‚Äôt need your defense.
---
i'm dumb and dont get it
---
Okay dont worry I give Credit i dont steal ideas
---
I didn‚Äôt have Space to Put Canary Sry
---
Fact: Carl's base model has legs.

Where is Mr. Bat

I like to state my opinion on something‚Äôs

No i was just saying its such a coincidence lol
---
if you mean takedown you are supposed to attack the robot not the players
---
Tick's head is going back to him after finishing colt and carl
---
My calculations Are always correct
---
Aw man
---
I saw it as well but it looked like a pirate themed big box
---
So you admit that its fake?
---
I think that's piret gene
---
Oh my stars
---
Yeah R.I... WAIT, POCO IS A SKELETON
---
But you just used ot when everyone else supered and slowed 8 bit, what nex using knockback to stop movement entirely.
---
Are you sure about that Man ?
---
I Guess is not that rare anymore XD
---
¬ø?
---
Could be like a Treasure Box you can get that only contains gold but a lot.
---
Pirate gene has a skull on his hat
---
True dat
---
Ah yes the bull is made of bull
---
Supercell is ea 2.0
---
I got Spike months ago and finally got him to Power 9. He's currently sitting at Rank 20, and hopefully I can get either one of his star powers. Not a fan of his low health, but his damage and grenade damage/mechanic is great. I want my next Legendary to be Crow, but the other 2 are ok as well.
---
Bakesale barley x Maple barley xD
---
But at some point, you‚Äôve gotten all of the others and your time between new brawlers, with few exceptions, is roughly equal to the time between two updates.
---
Tick can be surprisingly efficient against Mortis. I mean, even autoaim can work at point blank range provided you stand relatively still, and even if he 3 shot kills you, there's still a good chance he'll die from the mines still on the ground.
---
Yo why does it look almost exactly like barley? Is he one of them who switched sides? I need answers!
---
haha thanks man that name just came into my mind suddenly
---
is it confirmed they are cousins?
---
Bull

Be civil. Just report low effort posts and mods will remove them.

Oh nice catch, I was wondering what that card was all about
---
My name is Yoshikage Kira. I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.

Keep it upppppppp

trophy road brawlers

Yes. This is exactly how they do it in Clash Royale too. Legendaries are not meant to be super cards like in other games, they are just a different kind of too to play with.
