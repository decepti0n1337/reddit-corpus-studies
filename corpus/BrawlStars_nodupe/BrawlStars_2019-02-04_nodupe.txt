Nice edit!

Very good

Throwers might be a little too powerful, perhaps the middle gap could be about 3 or something tiles wide

I‚Äôm up to 0.17% chance at 7400 cups and still no legendary brawlers for me.

What‚Äôs a good way to find teammates? Is there an official brawl stars discoed?
---
There are only 5 people in rawanda 
---
üòÇ That Darryl got molested by those Franks. Gang violence 101.
---
taking the gems from the other team would be really difficult 
---
Didn't know this existed, thnx
---
Get rekt
---
So this is what randoms are doing during matches 
---
Lol. I got Leon from one yesterday. My odds were .1105
---
Hehe leon is invisible 
---
They should make it 8 so it only takes 2 days
---
F that; just join Clubs with a lot of members. People will usually Join, most want to climb haha 
---
Luck sent
---
Damn right i'm stuck at 200 cups w/him he's a real skill based character
---
Don't worry you'll get it soon just play and collect boxes! :D
---
I preferred it was nerfed
---
They did nerf his star power, and he is balanced, you just need to learn how to counter him
---
Oh. Well, I DID get 1 brawler to 400, but it tilted too 399 when the update came
---
Yeah, 100% garanteed, it can take less too.
---
My odds were 0.653!
---
Or make the zipper run all the way down the hoodie
---
Oh. Sorry üòñ
---
His super should be 3 wall breakers
---
100% agree with you
---
‚Äúhey guys look at me i have dynamike‚Äôs starpower‚Äù
---
Your friend can‚Äôt be in big game with you, the mode won‚Äôt let you play with a team
---
r/madlads
---
I‚Äôm at 7400 I hope they fix 11k by the time I get there 
---
No, I don't agree with this. Landing Frank's super isn't really all that easy. It has a huge wind up and many enemies will simply get out of the way. Not to mention in solo you'll get ganked by other players who try to take advantage not just of the stun but of the fact that you no longer have your super. Additionally Frank cant attack whole moving which makes attacking with him sort of high skill. Frank is powerful sure, but he lacks mobility. He might seem like an agro brawler at first but actual works super well as a support, keeping opponents at a distance. I think he's fine just the way he is.
---
Or change it to a chain. Make him more gangster

Nice fan art*

The servers are way too busy to focus on replays below 400, which are about 85% of the replays I believe, just as they fix the servers and lag they can focus on replays

Matchmaking is based on brawler trophies.

Check on youtube, they are two of the most followed brawl stars youtuber

If you got money and play this game a decent amount... Why not

---
Stat power?
---
Agreed. Old Brawl Ball was terrible. New Brawl ball is terrible. Brawl Ball is just terrible in general. 
---
Do you think he‚Äôs balanced?
---
Frank is one of the most balanced brawlers in the whole game, not too meta, but still good enough top players can and actually play him above 700, he is not op, you just need to know how and when to counter him, if you rush in as a low life brawler of course you are gonna get crushed, just as with Bull, Shelly, El Primo and many others
---
Wow you're only the 76,158th person to post that on this subreddit

I‚Äôm sorry what? What the hell does phishing have to do with teaming?

I literally just used the search bar and had to scroll through possibly 20 posts. Either way I see no reason for anyone to have to be telling me to stop posting something just because I was unaware of how common the error was.

Also if you're gonna be downvoting someone's comments over something so small like this, then you should really consider hiding the post as well as the guy who came here giving me an attitude.

That's...not how it works

Thanks. I‚Äôm not good at using computers, so this is the most I can do
---
Don't worry you'll get them eventually! 
---
Ok
---
Poor darryl getting abused like that
---
0% of people named "woodchuck321" have Leon.
---
Nice
---
How is that overthinking? If anything it was underthinking because i viewed it at face value
---
Speech 100
---
umm why show us ur id
---
Nah he‚Äôs just my favorite character, I would mostly grind with him for hours...
---
Chill bro, if you just have searched breaking walls bug, and sorted by new, thus post wouldn't even exist.
---
Just be careful next time not to post repetitive stuff.

90% of the time you just bounce back through the wall, i took me like 53 tries to do this lmao.

I‚Äòm not sure, but I think that the old one didn‚Äòt look the same. It was a bit different. 
---
Lol globals are gonna be globalüòÇ
---
1. Its a she
---
2. Its just a skin idea, not brawler idea
---
That's not the point. On every other brawler when I chose a specific skin, it always comes up on that skin automatically every time I select that brawler. Mike doss not. I know it's a small thing but its annoying. 
---
Lmao, super cell makes so much money. Their rewards are so bad amongst all of their games. Royale is a joke. 
---
Darryl gang rise up
---
this is actually hard to watch
---
Perfect angle, my friend.
---
I don‚Äôt get the joke, is poco sad bc he‚Äôs also kinda a skeleton?
---
And a cactus. 
---
I don't study this, so thanks for the info nerd
---
I hope you enjoy the strand of Colt‚Äôs hair you get from that box
---
ya i played in beta it was sick
---
Rip, I opened 22 boxes and didn't even get 3 gems
---
Welp i hope you get all the legendaries this month! 
---
Can supers destroy them?
---
no save them for a legendary, 300 more to go!
---
She needs a skin remodel

wtf

Theres a 1004 trophie nita too thats a power 5

She breaths on people too hard and kills them

Unless you're my boyfriend who did it in 4 months. I question why I'm with him. 
---
If you‚Äôve got an iPhone you can use shortcuts to download the video through the share button. Can post a video example if need be. 
---
I can see this working if:
---
1) there were a middle gap (so throwers wouldn't be too OP)
---
2) the walls were unbreakable to avoid team respawning right next to each other
---
3) you add some obstacles or walls on the long corridors, just to balance the brawlers (snipers would be OP w/o places to get cover)
---
lower it, or hear me out. make it better?
---
Oh now everyone is level 5 with star powers in bot matches, cool.
---
OMG everything makes sense now
---
I don't know who is worst ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I tried doing it thinking of Snipers, Tanks and Throwers!
---
i think he‚Äôs just fine. Still seems powerful in sd.

When was this?

I want darryl's voice to be cheerful robotic gurgling. 
---
yeah i know
---
[removed]
---
Or Thicco Bamba
---
Aaahhh sorry for the false assumption 
---
same but ive had a the same brawlers for a while, too boring
---
Happens to the best of us 
---
Poco should be in D tier
---
i already know boi
---
Is it brawlstars or would it be my phone?
---
that was spicy
---
Not too sure about a two hundred and fifty sixth could tho
---
That was my very first showdown game
---
Very, but that extra tile or two is very important.
---
Literally I saw this and remembered I had tickets, went into the game, spent 15, and got boss
---
We need compensation for indirect brawl ball nerf
---
I meant assuming. Just know I really don‚Äôt enjoy teaming, I see it around way too much and it‚Äôs annoying to come against when I‚Äôm grinding. Please don‚Äôt respond with an unpleasant comment, I don‚Äôt wanna start an argument. I only wanna clarify everything 
---
Seems more like a backstabbing couple

What the fuck

7.7k isn‚Äôt flexing
---
i agree with the poco flair, i've been able to open up a ton of extra boxes becaude of the extra 10 tokens i can get
---
Probably not, they‚Äôre meant to be something to run across, I mean there can be another type that can be destroyed possibly..
---
Twenty fifty sixth box may do it
---
Yes dude
---
F
---
HAS TO SMILE to make him somewhat huggable

Why tf you need to change your name so many times

I made it with a shiny stache at first, but it didn‚Äôt look right to me. Here‚Äôs a link to that in case anyone might prefer the shine. http://i.imgur.com/uYpEAOU.jpg
---
I think the background should be in the style it is today in the game, but I liked it!
---
Lol
---
Best of luck! :D
---
I THINK THIS GAME IS AMAZING AND HAS A TON OF POTENTIAL FOR YEARS TO COME
---
Those Frank's were auto aiming super smh. And the last shameless Frank who wanted to team again 
---
Penny and Frank don't need any change, the rest is ok
---
r/expectedtf2
---
Thanks! It‚Äôs actually directly based off the background you see when you unlock Barley and the other rares.
---
Very true.  I think bull mains think any medium sized patch of grass is a guaranteed win. But when literally all the Bulls are in the center shooting at each other knocking their health down even a Barly can swoop. In and steal the win
---
This looks great! I like the way that the main hub kinda thing isn‚Äôt exactly in the middle, nice!
---
Crow will be OP.
---
Pam, make those nerfs a little less harsh.
---
Spike, no that would be horrible because then he would be squishy and weak.
---
Penny, maybe not because sometimes I get hit by mortars I don‚Äôt see.
---
Frank no then frank will have too much health and no damage nerf because it‚Äôs hard to land shots.
---
When you started running at that one group of Franks like 20 seconds in it was hilarious watching them flee. Frank packs always remind me of herds of cows.
---
It is because you are at low trophies with him, also SD isn't the only way to say if he is good or bad
---
And yes, he can be good, but is underpowered compared to the rest
---
yeah, he sucks in gem grab
---
Nobody gives a shit bull sucks
---
Lmao 
---
I don‚Äôt need gold right now because I can‚Äôt get the stuff to upgrade them
---
Stop posting this
---
No one beats the Bull.
---
I also have Spike... SAKURA spike
---
Not quite sure how this is supposed to be a discussion but congrats I guess?
---
No, it‚Äôs just that the rewards after 3000 trophies are really bad.
---
I promise not to abuse, please tell
---
Mortis gang only
---
Supercell needs to fix this 
---
How exactly is it pointless? her current model looks fine imo. A skin would simply put a cool theme on it
---
Lmao I only have crow, but I should still be very grateful. Have fun :)
---
They didn't signal for it but it was clear that they purposely ignored each other. That's basically what teaming is though. An unspoken agreement not to kill/damage each other.  
---
i dont even know what my flair is
---
Really is a long explain, also the bot mod is banning people that explain this glitch
---
He's not completely irrelevant in hiest mate. In fact he's still good just not OP (pretty much now a full-on support)
---
Matchmaking is based on individual brawler trophies 
---
Wait what
---
My phone crashes a lot as well.
---
delete the link
---
You have crow and spike and have 3.1k trophies I have 8k trophies and don‚Äôt have a legendary 
---
Something something happy cake day.

So you showed me no math, you didn't DM me your proof. You are just salty that you don't understand the basic concept of RNG. Pathetic.

Me too brothers me too.

Idk just picked something random.

every day we stray further from god

wasn't sure if i should've included it or not, but I deleted it.
---
I see Leon‚Äôs and spikes way more often. Might just be that people actually use those if they get them though.
---
Out of my group I‚Äôm the only one with any so I can really use that for comparison 
---
Don't worry you'll get it soon! 
---
Rip reddit
---
Well, OP got hit by one of those, but he didn't die. That's good.
---
Rep
---
Everyone upvote!!! Supercell MUST see thid!
---
or they are going to do that bug
---
I heard about this is it real?
---
Yes it's real.
---
Literally anyone: look i got Leon from a normal box!
---
This sub: go to hell &gt;:^
---
You: look i got spike from a normal box!
---
This sub: nice c:
---
This is beautiful! I'd want it to be in the game
---
Honestly for me if you‚Äôre a noob then you‚Äôre better off going bull then Leon. I say as a noob who usually uses bull instead because I get better results
---
Don't blame me blame the commenters. 
---
**Your brain on Leon**
---
Thanks for the reply and alternate strategy.  I've been wondering the same myself.  I have 3k gold in the bank and all my brawlers are between level 4 and 7.  I could get Shelly from level 5 to 7 but that's a big chunk of change so I do follow the advice of not upgrading as soon as I can.
---
I like the idea of creating the chance for star power drops.  
---
Read the rules. r/BrawlRecruit
---
No did you see all the cacti smh
---
And thats bad?
---
It is already something extra. It is something else you get for playing all gamemodes, so doesn't need any buff
---
That‚Äôs great gameplay
---
... why? don't you already have everything?
---
"I found". There are literally 100 posts about this...
---
I wish lmao
---
Yea sex is cool and all but have you broken walls in brawl stars?
---
So you might think that buying the points in shop are preventing you from having gold in the future, but what KairosTime covered in one of his vids was that if you once get max power points, your power point drops in boxes become converted to 2 gold per power point; which is the price you purchase them at in the shop. 
---
Also Kairos recommended that you get all brawlers to power 7 and then focus on individual brawlers. This is because power 7 is only a 10% stat difference than a maxed out brawler, but obviously without the star power. But to be fairly competitive in all modes it‚Äôs the best to get all brawlers to 7 so you don‚Äôt get stuck playing as o only a few brawlers. 
---
Same I bet 5 tickets and then being a boss,and then the other matches I also bet 5 tickets and boss again
---
Currently, if you are below 3,000 trophies, then if you have any brawler above 500 trophies, they won‚Äôt lose any trophies after the season ends. This is very unfair for pro players. This is unfair because they have to lose all their trophies, and then make them all back up again. Supercell, this NEEDS to be fixed. Thanks!
---
I am going to gut you, like a cornish game hen
---
No hat? *gasp*
---
So....you killed yourself?
---
*barley spawn with primo*
---
French
---
Broken beyond BROKEN 
---
I wouldn't say he's OP, at least not without his star power. I think it seems like he is because for the first time in a whole he can actually hold his own against brawlers besides throwers at an equal skill level. It's a very aggressive brawler so you are going to be getting killed my him a lot making him seem better than he actually is. 
---
Then you have brawlers like crow who are the opposite. It seems like he is trash because he doesn't get many kills but it's extremely helpful to his team keeping enemies constantly unable to heal up. People treat these game modes like death matches when it's more about pushing enemies back especially in gem grab.
---
Bro beta launch was like 7 months earlier than that
---
i mean, get close to him and he's dead. i think he's damage should be buffed at least!
---
Honestly, no, I haven‚Äôt noticed a lot of bots. I will add that if they avoid gems, they are probably playing agro, which makes it ideal to not grab gems
---
Interesting idea, I think even if the super just dealt damage to jumping characters rather than out right stopping them it would still be cool.
---
Star Power: walk
---
I don‚Äôt care what people say, Darryl is trash. He doesn‚Äôt ‚Äújust take skill,‚Äù he‚Äôs just bad
---
I mean yeah but I was still first so ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
reported :)
---
Nah he just needs faster super charge. This will make him able to be more aggressive and run away if needed.
---
He really likes colt!??
---
Yeah there is a video, the AutoAimGod player upload a video about how the glitch works
---
did you win?
---
the most I've gotten is 6 - with a Dynamike. good on ya
---
Sorry, I guess I don't lurk around r/brawlstars 24/7 and sort by new.
---
He is abusing of a matchmaking glitch, not skill since the glitch make him to play with brawlers lvl 1
---
No actually they are from china
---
You are correct. I had a 1000+ tara back a while ago on an alt under 3k. At 3k I lost it
---
Heretics 
---
How do you make maps like that I have some ideas and I wish to post them!
---
EEELLLLL PRIMOOOO

What is that safari time for? ;)

Gang R.P.E is also a good strategy to have fun
---
r/brawlrecruit
---
whoops sorry i mean primk sorry fam
---
Can she summon Poco?
---
Ah yes he just happened to ignore both of the people who spun in front of him. haha I'm not saying it was a bad thing to team I was just pointing it out.
---
you switched to darryl
---
stop you violated the law pay the court a fine or serve your sentence
---
I never said anything about him charging in. The thing is he lacks independence. He can't really fight off a brawler on his own, and all he can really do is chip health, cause annoyance, or just steal kills.  
---
You should make this a screen saver
---
Haha I am really new here download Reddit ap yesterday only because of brawl stars. I still don't know how to üò≠. I would love to have crow by my username
---
:
---
How long did it take?
---
Short range brawlers would die pretty quick tbh
---
Barley is 10x better at 500+ in heist.
---
Like 8 months
---
Maybe tht means how much DPS he doesüòÇüò¨
---
I got addicted the first couple weeks I played and got to 3000 trophies. Aaaaand I ended up spending quite a bit on the game. Probably about 150 or 200. I don't want to look lmao
---
At 4200 trophies now and I feel I've got enough enjoyment/hours out of the money I put in. Plus I won't be tempted to buy more since I have almost everything I want. It's also the first mobile game I've invested in like this (maybe $5-10 max in the past) so it could be worse.
---
El Primk is here 
---
What an absolute mad lad
---
I didn't give u the upvote cause ur mortis doesn't have the hat 
---
It was even longer on coc
---
Good for you ! Enjoy him he‚Äôs very fun !
---
Its a pipers heaven i say it needs way more cover
---
F2p?
---
Lol same :)
---
But vampires can't cross water
---
I dont think it needs to be lowered, but they should make it that every time youre the star player u get a star token
---
Because he did. u/Sector03 is the OP
---
No longer a thing, just from the beta version of the game üëç
---
Hahaha, thanks for the chuckle.
---
I have about 1000 victories and no epic, Legendary, or mystical brawlers except Frank...I‚Äôve also spent $10 on the lunar new year package.
---
Yea I been playing since beta
---
Nice you have to use him right for him to be good though.
---
Look at the amount of gems he has at the beginning 
---
Oh damn that just motivated me thx
---
He was just bad I don‚Äôt think Leon‚Äôs crazy now but he‚Äôs still top 3 easily probably still the best
---
Your post has been removed, make sure to use the body of a post to elaborate on the title.
---
Been savin them up for quite a while
---
Replay mode
---
But no one needs gold anymore at 11k
---
This was absolutely amazing 
---
hi
---
just saw how, with all the pity matchmaking and stuff
---
u/frank_supercell fix your gamr
---
Star tokens replace the first victory bonus which was in the beta, a small reward just to motivate you to play every map. They aren't supposed to be as good as keys.
---
What the actual üÖ±Ô∏èuck
---
I play since beta and I‚Äôm just gettin my brawlers to 500 it‚Äôs not pushing just grinding
---
If u wanna push you begin when a new season starts and push all brawlers as high as possible. That way you can get over 15k
---
Well done, you've just about convinced me to stop sinking more time into this game. Thank you 
---
Darryl aproves
---
There is a new brawler found in datamines which can walk over water
---
Thats actually a pretty good idea
---
Oh ok that makes sense, I just found out a few hours ago too lol, thanks for clarifying.
---
Lobers suck 
---
What r u talking bout, he's totally serious and so am I... we need to buff spike and Leon and seriously nerf crow (just triple his speed and reduce his hp &amp; damage to 2)
---
How did Rico gain all that weight?
---
Uhhh! no, i dont think so ))
---
Kindly look into solutions to fix the teaming up in solo showdown. 
---
Make life leech automatically activated when two brawlers are next to each other and not attacking.  What happens if two people are good at dodging you ask that will make them split apart of be more aggressive the positive outweigh the negative.
---
Also in addition to the above also give one trophy for each brawler a player takes down. You can leave the current trophy rewards in solo showdown as is with the combined bonus above or lower the currently trophy rewards by one but give brawlers a trophy for each player taken down. 
---
If none of the above works kindly provide some fix for the problem. 
---
Should being lucky determine if you can progress further?
---
I agree with you too :)
---
Wtf kkkkkkkkkkk WP
---
There's hoodies where the zipper runs just halfway down, leon's could be one of them

Was about to say this is photoshopped, then I went to check the leaderboards... damn dude!!

Darryl has low cool down of his super.

üòÇ hell no

Good job man! You can push to 11k easy you have 22 brawlers.

Were talking about big boxes not small boxes

What else would it be?

Nice work.

Idea: you take an IQ test so we can figure out whether you‚Äôre too negligent to join a club or just too stupid.

Thanks
---
There are plenty of buyers that do. I know i guy whos spent 2000 dollars on this game 
---
Yes
---
You should push em all to 300 for that sweet blue rank
---
Haters will say it's fake
---
Are u telling me star powers are not p2w? Or u "just need skill" also for that?
---
If not play to win, then we can call it pay to play
---
The other small players were probably pissed you weren‚Äôt helping get the maximum goods the big guy was so happy  
---
1096 coins for just one Penny... not even brawl stars is immune to inflation
---
retarted

this isnt you though
---
Take my Upvote!
---
Not worth
---
Nope its not
---
There have been rumors of a new fighter....
---
We, the mortis gang, need to focus this new hero down in every match we go to. If there is a barley with only 400 HP or this new hero with max health, strike down this misfortunate new hero.
---
Spin twice upon a secured kill.
---
This was the meeting for today.

Discuss in the comments

FBI open up!!!

Really impressive. Killing that Dynamike and Barley team was good of you.
---
Mortis gang, assemble your upvotes
---
Good idea but the Photoshop made me laugh
---
I care to disagree
---
That's actually not wrong because the majority of the time you want to be able to close players down so you can get the ball. There's better brawlers. 
---
The words of a wise man
---
Let‚Äôs do this.
---
its okay
---
Mega box worth 15
---
Make it Mega
---
i would save for token doubler
---
What do you mean I don't understand
---
So sick 
---
Oh I thought you were saying 2 1/2 days for 3 small boxes, my bad
---
xD, but thanks
---
Sorry but what exactly was the joke
---
I think the skull and arms should be white and the sombrero needs to be blue
---
Well, Rico isn't an outlaw anymore. I think Jessie modified him to be a gum ball machine :(

that is **bloody** majestic
---
Epic
---
That's called a replay 
---
I got my Mortis to 500 in brawl ball! It was before the balances changes that killed Mortis Bb ofc but it was a good match! (21s against 3 tanks in pinhole punt) 
---
Broni feel sorry for you. So many of my new playing friends got legendaries in their first weel or two. My suggestion is that you stop playing for a while, supercell notices players who are logged in all day then stop playing for 2 whole days. I like to believe theres a sort of algorithm to make esch plsyer spend the most money they can ppssibly make him spend. A hardcore player never gets legendaries or cool cards but surprisingly casuals get then all the time... I was so desperate at one point in time that i opened up a ticket to ask for my legendary chance (back in early stages of beta, more than a year ago).
---
Bro you are my clon, im in like 5150 trophies, i olny have 15 brawlers (the best pam), lel.
---
So that means i live right beside Leon?
---
how do you do it tho?
---
Im so glad the community and focusing on game changing ideas ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è /sarcasm
---
Hmmm a reason to not move the spawn points back is that maybe the map creator wanted it this way, wow that‚Äôs a wild idea 
---
watched ur vid got inspired and won a game with 3 shelly‚Äôs. It was a no 9 kill but it was a great game. 
---
Its a bug where you play vs bots on purpose
---
Agree.  makes me happy that some don‚Äôt team 
---
Nice bro
---
Nicu
---
Poco is just a rare brawler that can heal with his super. Nothing more.
---
Honestly, The level packs are always worth, same for the Brawler offer in my opinion. Id rather pay a few gems than open endless boxes.
---
Any sort of casual mode without trophies loss/gain would be pleasant
---
*Brrringer of Bats*
---
NO
---
10 chars
---
And people that want Tap to Shoot back. It interferes with supercells 'simplicity'. Theres no need for changing joystick placement unless you're left hand or have a health incapacity. 
---
Reeeeepost
---
Why are you not wearing his hat?
---
Well if you gets lots of 2nd and 4th and you don‚Äôt mind losing a bit then why argue about all this 
---
Mortis without hat... such a shame
---
People have differeny play styles
---
*leon*
---
This would actually be one of the coolest skins in the game if they made it
---
Ye ur right, sorry
---
Primk gang!
---
I don't really know, i just put a random title to that map, because i am not profesional at picking good title for maps :)
---
Haha
---
We also have a vampire in the game so why is a zombie not appropriate.
---
Can you explain how making the map rotation slower affects how quickly you get the boxes? I might not really have a good understanding of how you get star tokens
---
Thanks man!
---
nice idea! 
---
Damn that's amayzin
---
Thanks!
---
Good job for that girl XD
---
I've had 10 
---
I like how you said morris lol
---
Everytime a new event comes up you can play it to earn a star token. If events rotate slower you earn them slower as a result.
---

---
noob teamer! 
---
Dont spoil it. Please. 
---
stolen post delete
---
Haha, me neither. I‚Äôm just offering an idea, because why not? It‚Äôs worth being friendly and dropping ideas
---
No its not. The bug is different. 
---
did you just assume its gender
---
That's how mafia works! 
---
You mean friendly gammode? With bots or friends?
---
Oh I‚Äôm sorry, I didn‚Äôt realize people didn‚Äôt know that certain maps cater to certain brawlers at different levels. Every map no matter who you are playing requires skill to win. If you know how to play then I would hope that you understand this.
---
Idea: give us more free shit
---
His super is for surviving not for dealing damage and already deals nice damage.
---
What if I don‚Äôt fancy paying money?
---
We also will never take off the hat 
---
900 nice damage? Cool ü§£
---
Nope. 
---
Finally not a repost without credit. I hate ppl who repost without credit or as their on artwork.  Btw would buy for 200 gems 
---
A lot has changed since I was 3,000 trophies. Besides I wanna see how the game feels starting up in this day and time. It‚Äôs fun to be an undercover beginner and run SD. 
---
You are talking about the level 1 stats
---
leon is best mortis sucks
---
Yeah üòå
---
Yep.
---
Okey, i am betaplayer aswell
---
Nah. 
---
Anyway his super is for surviving
---
Really
---
I have leon
---
In the shopüò¢
---
nope, it‚Äôs a glitch/bug
---
Rise Morris gang 
---
Use his super to heal, not take out enemies
---
Creature of the darkness!
---
Nope 
---
I'm Mexican and it is I approve 
---
I wish it's not pay2win or im going back to CoC
---
There‚Äôs nothing wrong with this
---
I already watched the tutorial and but it still doesn't work for me. I have 2600 trophies so it should work.
---
It‚Äôs nice you put your watermark so that people won‚Äôt steal your content once more. I love the map
---
*smirks in Darryl*
---
Quoting u/Axel1702

"Yep, also report the post. I mean, he "gave credit" in the title, but this is the 5th time he posts the same thing trying to get karma, with the argument of "iT iS In tHE iNtERnET, sO aNyBodY cAn uSe It"". 
---
not excatly for feast. feast is more of bull
---
Thats pretty cool! (becuz i have a piper) 
---
Yes, losing some games on purpose and then going into a 3v3 will get you bots as enemies(granted that you got less than 3'000 trophies.
---
Oh no he is one of thos retarded Mexican kids who use ":v"
---
I should know, im Mexican myself. 
---
As someone who got Dynamike recently, I make it a goal to kill any other Mikes.
---
You know you are a random to right? 
---
mhmm weird maybe try it again, its important that you follow the steps closely and dont forget anything
---
Accurate 
---
The real tragedy here is the 600 total gold you get for climbing 1000 trophies at that level. Lmao.
---
OG player. There wasn‚Äôt a trophi road in beta. U could unlock dyna in a box
---
Unlocked before trophy road was a thing
---
What? 
---
(i already expected someone to say this)
---
He is a soft launch player!!! üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Allow token multipliers on star tokens
---
I‚Äôm not saying I‚Äôm stopping him, he can chase his dreams!
---
lol
---
What's the method? For my biology studies. 
---
Just look at the map, there is an inclination, if it had to be as you said, you would have to watch the game exactly from above, making it into a 2D game
---
a legend
---
Why primk
---
I'm sending a message here dumbass. I'm just trying to say that u guys are just freaking amateurs who think u know the game so u go on reddit and start waving ur large egos around like u know what the hell ur saying. Why don't u go watch "That Guy Jeff" he gives great darryl tips for idiots like u
---
These are bots , that new players play with or against them .
---
well, loot and loop sounds like a same thing
---
so, yeah
---
And then Supercell decided to add that...voice
---
Meck #SICKO
---
Name: Phobia
---
Attack: Curses nearby enemy brawlers with her dark spells and has a circular range.
---
Super: Possession- Can possess any one brawler and has the ability to control him/her for 7 seconds. (During this, she combines with the brawler) After 7 seconds, she's thrown away to the nearest friendly brawler. (Try not to auto-aim as she can even hurt nearby foes while possessing)
---
Star power: Voodoo- The enemy who attacks her will receive 40% of the inflicted damage.
---
Mek*sicko*
---
Lol ikrüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
With that much water in-between they couldn‚Äôt 
---
Works bad. 
---
Brawler that barley can destroy is short ranged and slow speed brawler.
---
Map wise just play him in a map with a lot of walls.
---
His hard counters are Mortis and darryl
---
Like they would do that though, would mean they make less money 
---
Brawler trophies
---
he shouldve jumped while holding 10 gems for the pic
---
Hi I'm a dynamike main. I think you'll love to see me on the mapüòú
---
It is how soy sauce looks like without a cap
---
Gotta gen dem froot loops
---
Gotta give some credit to tara thooo
---
he can attack over walls, most brawlers can't. that's his advantage.  he is not a 'one man army' type brawler, rarely wins game singlehandedly.  he is a team brawler.  good for heist ,gem grab,duo showdown, his main target are other low health brawlers,can take out tanks if attacks long enough.
---
he is map dependent, look for maps where you can throw  bottles over walls.
---
I have no words
---
Even then 300 are too low. It‚Äôs less than from a mega box tho
---
Isn‚Äôt this like solo showdown?
---
Wrong section, should be on art not ideas, and there you‚Äôd be able to put the creator name. Anyway I hope something like this will never come true, I really hope that CR stays out of Bs as much as possible, CoC too. It‚Äôs a different world
---
Because he ether sucks or unkillable in gems matches. 
---
Throwers on this map though
---
Mortis gang!
---
So it‚Äôs like a one hunter and 9 prey game
---
Someone who likes Shelly 
---
use mortis.
---
üëèüëèNice , you support f2p players
---
You wanna make bounty a bull fest my man??
---
lel
---
Kind of, but like everyone is trying to kill each other. But you're alone, so you're not on a team.
---
Yes I did, but it wasnt a reply to you, it was to the other guy above your comment. He‚Äôs above yours on my screen
---
But this make brawler from bottom see u easier than u see him
---
So like solo showdown
---
Yeah, but is also not in the Low trophies too 
---
Mortis did get his hat right? Btw i got mortis todayüòç
---
this is christmas and at christmas time (when i started playing) it changed from 600 to 500, and when tara wasn‚Äôt in the game when it was 600. delete ur comment
---
*psst, see the flair at the top*
---
You tricked me!I will avenge myself(cries in a corner)
---
100% certain that's not a bot.
---
Needs different Super and Star Power, Super would be very hard to implement and the star power is very very strong haha
---
WASTED
---
Creatures of the night!
---
Yep, another post about teaming. I'll just add it to the other 1037482926 already in the pile, so that Supercell will notice the issue. Fantastic idea by the way.
---
that hand wants some if you know what i mean
---
It happens for slow wifi, it is not a bug
---
Maybe you just suck ü§≠
---
How the fuck Shelly g√°s 0 trophys
---
In solo showdown!
---
I‚Äôve teamed up with frank at times and we got to top 2. Sometimes he likes to hit you to build up his special, other times he will just purposely backstab you. Rule of thumb, don‚Äôt team up with anyone that can easily kill you at close range.
---
Then you are a random too! Get that primo off my face you filthy random!
---
Can I Buy That?
---
You know what, I don't think the super is that op. (Anyway supercell is never going to add it.üòÖüòÖ) 
---
mortis = genji's dash
---
Yeah the super is not op, just very hard to implement
---
What happened if all my brawlers max.
---
Who plays duo with randoms?
---
Thank you!! üòä
---
yea i know, that's why these kind of 3d games work better on console. graphically talking, that's correct, i know it isn't really fair when someone is using a range brawler, but at least this problem appears just in showdown, as in the other modality you'll always be at the bottom for yourself
---
A face like that but with a voice like a geek.
---
It's beautiful 
---
Cool!
---
The post here about not using him past 400 only account for if you don't play him in any game type but show down. He's great in heist and even gem grab if used properly 
---
Although if they added this brawler, it would be soo fun to play. Maybe just tweak it's super like reducing the super to 5 seconds or when an enemy is possessed it loses half of it's health and inflicts 20% less damage.
---
I want it right now
---
What a nice flex. I cry everytime.
---
He needs a buff, but you suck at balancing. 20% is just stupid
---
"Another round?"
---
I thought this bug was patched lmao
---
Forgot to change accounts lol
---
Btw great skin I wish I was good with names
---
Want to kill them
---
You can get a victory If you wait for the right moments, just attack everyone you know you can kill and hide
---
Mortis gang rise up
---
Kid, delete this and go to r/BrawlRecruit
---
Well done mate
---
And then Mortis starts speaking 
---
SLICE AND DICE
---
I use mortis in heist event
---
Lmfaoo
---
So maybe an exchange system would be better
---
Mortis without a hat is not a Mortis
---
It gets boring af though.... Like how is it possible to get teamed up with people who suffer down syndrome so much? 
---
Noob
---
https://link.brawlstars.com/invite/friend/en?tag=89RUL90J&amp;token=pxn22s6m add me please
---
SIN DOLOR NO HAY GLORIA
---
Because yes they have an entirely different login system with an entirely new phishing detector... No, it's the same thing
---
Do you get tokens anymore, I just started playing again and haven‚Äôt seen those
---
Bull would have fun.
---
Ill Primo
---
Yup I feel you on this one
---
Or when I try to escape a Shelly only to be one shot by a Bull in a bush because I can‚Äôt check them with my main attack 
---
Maybe with white instead of black
---
Primo lunch!
---
Oh shit i forget it doesn't show that this is heist
---
how does soy sauce hurt
---
Ehm, I‚Äôm at 8200, I‚Äôm having three brawlers of mine above 500 and, suddenly, I steel see tons of them in sd and the are still overpowered. Got it?
---
As in the Clash Royale you can no longer request cards, or in this case the power points
---
How do you keep finding my posts
---
I feel extra powerful when I have 10 gems though, so much that I am ready to take on all the enemies at once. 
---
you better bullieve it
---
This is heist
---
Dynamike Star power would wreck this map if enemy brawlers have no throwers, basically Dynamike leaves one layer of wall and jumps in, collects all the gems and wait till countdown ends
---
Jesus Christ dude, you make the most amazing interpretations of these toons.
---
otro espa√±ol
---
&amp;#x200B;

Really cool ! I like it

Nice graphics woooow
---
In my opinion, black looks more like Proüí™
---
otro espa√±ol... es el mismo de antes xD
---
POR CIERTO BUEN TRABAJO
---
And I thought my power 5 Dyna at 500 was impressive
---
Its more like a golden chest
---
What did you use to do It?
---
Delousional
---
otra vez tu xDDDDD
---
There‚Äôs no way
---
I knew, that i should made it covered with the ice !
---
**VAMONOS**
---
The maps are supposed to be playable, not to look cool
---
Oh no jo 
---
Come on, stop spamming this know bug, it's been posted 1k times
---
definitly
---
you mean 3780 hp?
---
Thanks. Yeah I know but everytime I open around 5 brawl boxes it increases. But this time I opened 20

Who‚Äôs going to play piper on this map

---
Oh ok, thank you
---
What exactly?
---
Shows off El Primo bug on reddit..............everybody logs on BS to try it out.
---
Thank you
---
But do u know why supercell closed all  of my conversations. Idk why they would do that tho
---
HAHAHAHA THIS IS JUST AS FUNNY THE 700TH TIME HAHAHAHHA
---
Bruh who took my screenshot
---
Remember me this also amazing just like samurai mortis
---
Maybe you are F2P unlike me and it triggers something into Supercell algorithm when you pay, some kind of secret bonus stats idk 
---
No
---
I am doe B)
---
I know this is a joke an all but I feel as if spike needs a buff anyone else? he's kinda bad everywhere I used to love playing him but lately can't play him at all. 
---
Now that‚Äôs a good idea
---
https://youtu.be/u0Z4STg9qJI
---
Good idea, as we cant use discord in random matches.
---
But would need a mute button tho, like u/SparklyBoat said...
---
Always pass the ball if your teammate can score
---
Yep
---
Whatever I have it should work fine. You dumbass.
---
How can you put the character after your name?
---
Yeah he didn‚Äôt even unlock Brock yet üòÇ
---
When we start playing showdown in low end devices the match start after a delay of 4-5 seconds 
---
Actually though 
---
Noob 
---
Darryl's super is OP on all that water. I like it.
---
But they can fly
---
I'm just so tired, tired of loss
---
I also see my pack luck
---
GENERAL REPOSTI!
---
Mod should implement a filter for this shitty low effort posts.
---
Yeah, that¬¥s why you never have to steal Crow¬¥s power box
---
You made an old joke!
---
It shouldn‚Äôt have been close.....
---
#It was a 4 v 1
---
*earrape In The Jungle starts*
---
I made the band called "Fix Your Game" to feature a Bug that we used in hope Supercell would notice. It's not an awareness to auto aim. Its about a bug explained here
---
I think he‚Äôs referring to the two legendaries
---
Bueno despu√©s de la √∫ltima actualizaci√≥n parece que eso ha mejorado y ahora ya son 200 fichas las que tenemos disponibles, a√∫n as√≠ mucha gente sigue buscando maneras de mejorar m√°s r√°pidamente, yo encontr√© mucha ayuda para el juego en esta web en espa√±ol sobre Brawl Stars [https://descargarbrawlstars.org](https://descargarbrawlstars.org) m√≠rala porque aparte de mostrar las √∫ltimas novedades tienen info sobre ganar gemas y cosas as√≠.

No, thank you for making it!

Thanks for your art post! If you are not the creator of this work, please make sure that you have included the source, or to  comment it here! Unsourced art may be removed if you are not the creator.
---
Never saw this before lol i based it off the person who made all of the different characters out of clay
---
His super is quite useful, at time if u play well u can defeat a Leon/Frank with him.
---
Oh, I like the clones idea. 
---
It would be a good map in duo SD w/ 4 teams only...
---
Hey man I really am a Shelly main
---
You have died because you shouldnt have ran of that bull when was just 4 brawlers left. You had you super charged
---
He used  a big
---
Wow thats fuckig lit! I love it sooooo much! That probably took long to make with all the details
---
**we need to nuke Sierra Leone asap**
---
It‚Äôs the other way
---
Showdown is basically Tanks and Shelly's only.
---
Let's not forget the ocassional Shelly 
---
If that doesn't have a symbol for the old elixir on the back, I swear I'm suing
---
14 is best you just have to be patience. I recently got a team of me playing Penny with Shelly and Jessie in brawl ball and we won straight for like 10 matches. So much fun.
---
Piper in an open map 
---
Yes 
---
honor stolen :P
---
any tip for the genetic defects who after consulting with their last 3 brain cell believes that rushing the entire enemy team while carrying 10 gems,with low health?
---
I hope I get Tara soon too, thank you!
---
His chance for legendaries must be like 0.0001 now.
---
El Bursto
---
Even a 3 second possession would be too strong, you can just run into the fog plus if both brawlers are both health then her star power would be an easy no skill win
---
Not a bad concept
---
I know right?! Some people have all the brawlers at 4k trophies, and us who are stuck in this situation just hope to unlock a new brawler soon since the game becomes boring playing with the same brawlers everytime.
---
I really like the second idea. People will start to see potential ‚Äúteammates‚Äù as trophies that once eliminated will give them easy points and paranoia will cause teaming to fade out.
---
More like iRicochet
---
Yeah I‚Äôve seen this somewhere before like a month ago
---
If only we could get tokens for this like practice mode did
---
I ant imagine Mortis‚Äô voice coming out of that mouth
---
That‚Äôs rude
---
This would be intense, but yet so good
---
Ooooo that I didn't saw. 
---
yes you fuck
---
Not the person who commented first but what happens if you have big fingers and normally you use the attack joystick in the yellow highlighted field on the picture
---
Hey. At least in my experience, Feanks aren't that troubling to Primos.
---
Then again I probably faced bad Franks.
---
I had this problem where I get constant lag on wifi only but on data it was fine. Turned out it was the bluetooth. I turned it off and voila!
---
Idk about your case tho, thought this might help.
---
...an hour
---
Appreciate the feedback
---
Exactly! It doesn't need to be a lot but just enough to make things more fair.
---
10/10 mile
---
At level 6 and over he can pull his weight in solo showdown, all ya gotta do is aim for second 
---
That's what I'm talking about. Randoms can be good too!
---
Yeah it's like rng... Why put trophy system at all if it doesn't test your skill in showdown?
---
You are a true hero! That Jesse never spun. That Shelly was trying to n00b.... I mean, team. And thus, she got what she deserved.
---
hahaha
---
i‚Äôd buy it. no discussion.
---
Gold 
---
Maybe not... but really they just have to hold you there for the teeth. :)
---
Primo crunch
---
I'm not saying I'm good. I'm just trying to say that if I can get darryl to 600 without his star power so can all of you. I suck because i play showdown. And I'm not angry btw.
---
They haven't made teaming punishable yet tho
---
Im just gonna assume youre under 10 tp keep my sanity
---
It's a band ffs

*oh wait fuck*

still impressive

You dont need to. It does it automatically
---
Except if she has the star power
---
strategy
---
:D
---
#Get a better phone too?
---
I‚Äôm not sure! Mine has been increasing. They say it increases when you open 3 mega, 30 brawl or 10 big boxes. It may be visual bug. It happened to me when I first started the game. If the problem persists contact supercell. 
---
I agree with the message, jut not that it depicts domestic violence! I'm so conflicted! On the one hand I hate teamers! I hate them so much! They're literally garbage! And on the other hand I vehemently condemn domestic violence! Men who beat women are literally garbage! Idk which way to vote on this! 
---
*panics and jumps out a window*
---
What is this? 2011?
---
Thank you for doing your part
---
Wait, that's illegal.
---
Haven't seen as much teaming as before 
---
I‚Äôm f2p and I‚Äôm only missing Mortis lol. Unlucky. 
---
The chances
---
What level is this gene?
---
Probably the developer build
---
It still takes alot of time and dedication to get there.
---
Idk who I trust
---
Colts super goes through walls though...
---
Level 1!
---
I sympathise
---
If ur saying crow sucks I‚Äôm triggered reeeee
---
Well im not that‚Äôs why i dont like this matchup xd
---
Supercell already commented on this matter. Adding a game mode where there would be no trophies gained or lost would take away competitiveness which is exactly what they don‚Äôt want. A game mode like this will never be implemented.
---
yay all brawlers at 6k dammit.
---
Omg
---
Can you post a link
---
;)
---
Seems fun and balanced. Great job!
---
y

---
You weren‚Äôt clear at all with your initial statement.
---
OHHHHH AMAZING I LIKE IT GOOD MAP but for which mode?????
---
You shouldn‚Äôt of answered üòÇ üòÇ 
---
Stop posting it so much you can get reported for spam
---
It should be this link
---
That‚Äôs normal
---
Suomi
---
Agreed! I should've removed 1 or 2 water puddles
---
Literally just unlocked Pam. Supercell is always watching 
---
I like it
---
It should be 10 from normal instead of one... that would make sweet goddamn money
---
Whatever, was a rhetorical question
---
Is that Bo?
---
ELLLLL PRIMOOO
---
No, it does both. If you have 3 brawlers in a line, and colt uses super, it will hit all 3
---
I have made my decision. Beginning from now, I will downvoted every single drake meme that comes on this subreddit. Seriously, it‚Äôs so boring, exhuasting, and it‚Äôs not funny anymore. But hey, this is Reddit. Still, different memes should be placed instead of trash templates like this
---
hahahah üëçü§£

I don't think that's how you use that picture

Damn he came straight for u

Search on Google Play Store Brawl Stars Map Maker
---
Huh didn‚Äôt realise.
---
Point still stands then for other attacks then
---
And yeah, thanks for appreciate!
---
Okay thanks
---
New description is easier for new players
---
I honestly like new description more
---
We can have like campaign mode with stories rather than this
---
Shelly's super is killer
---
Same just happened to me last night, felt like such a ripoff since I'm missing a decent amount of brawlers.

This is dope.. cool walpaper!!

Yes, that is still true
---
I think it‚Äôs Primo
---
WAHHHHH
---
You make it sound like you are buying it. It is a free reward given to you. Getting 3 extra boxes every 2 days is a good deal. Supercell doesn‚Äôt want to speed up the progression too much.
---
Where can I buy this shirt???????
---
Lmao this is true
---
Hmmmm... 
---
I love it soo much.. lit! I hope they rework him bcs his chest looks like a 3D box :D but ur art is üëåüëå
---
Why did you post it 4 times?
---
He has 13k trophies... The glitch works on low trophies accounts.
---
Just if they spin tbh.
---
I'm such a sucker for samurai-like designs, and this one is no exception. Good work!

As long as you sign in with Google on the new device, you should get all of your data back
---
Haha, not 3, more like 1.
---
How can you feel happy about it when you won by teaming.
---
uh I meant the second corridor on the left that he walked past. He walked down and continued to be in leon‚Äôs line of sight
---
OMG üòÆ 
---
Noobs when they join the game: don‚Äôt check the bush or don‚Äôt check the bush.
---
Oh. My. God.

---
the blue team has a huge advantage
---
Why do I feel like this is a repost?
---
I need this
---
Kinda balanced,some maps makes the whole players team,like double trouble.
---
It's okay officer, I'm using ~~dark~~ Afro-American reddit theme 
---
Never knew these existed, without this comment, I would have never known I wanted this. Thank you!
---
Should be like: a) Hide in the middle bush
---
b) Hide in one of the bushes around
---
Same here, I never believe in my WiFi
---
I won with rock paper scissors
---
i only have 38 boxes atm, its not looking good for me 
---
&gt; Bring back the charm that this game once had Supercell.
---
You nailed it. Sure I'm loving the current state of the game too, but the first build had something really special I couldn't put my finger on. You nailed it, it was it's charm.
---
Lol I got Bo when he was epic
---
I agree on the Shelly 
---
Beautiful map even though playability is questionable 
---
No u just change the icon...
---
Stupid u think u can trick people?!
---
main?
---
Wait just because they use them doesn't mean they suck 
---
I use primo and bull in showdown and I don't win every match in fact I won like 10 percent if the time so those brawler s may be annoying and not skillful but as long as you don't just play they don't suck.
---
You ruined a great thing.

Lmao how can you not lose trophies in this situation without teaming?

I see you truly lack skill, bet you‚Äôre that camper 
---
Nice concept! She seems a little too basic for a mythic though, maybe make her an epic probably. I'm also concerned about the flashbang, how would work on the person who gets affected? Are they not able to see a part of their screen or what? Anyways love the concept!
---
Olha... achei um BR ksksk
---
They are lol we have a whole clan of just people with bot and a number after 
---
you can still see the raft meme right b4 it switches to brawl stars. Anyway i like it, you should have done this in island tho and rolled around the sides
---
Ok. Stuff like that happens. Someone makes something and has no clue someone else made it.
---
Who gave this guy gold? Let me join in lol
---
It's spelled S T R A T E G Y! 
---
For blindness effect, 90% of your screen turns white. That remaining 10% is the significant amount of opacity in the corners of the screen.
---
Sometimes i do. Its easy trophies. But i usually do it for brawlers that suck at showdown.
---
if you double the token doubler, it gives 20 brawl boxes for only 50 gems!! That's insane! Right now it's fine since it gives 10 brawl boxes for 50 gems. Also, a brawl box is worth 10 gems each so already the token doubler gives a lot of value. 
---
nice art, but i don't think samurai fits to tara, i mean... a samurai uses a sword as weapon. And tara will not throw 3 swords :3 so nah better call this a fan art.
---
Oh alright.
---
Je Bent Le motherfucker
---
So is Leon

He‚Äôs on internet explorer guys don‚Äôt judge

Maybe she throw shurikens... right?

---
I find it sad how you're assuming I team.
---
No, I do not team, but if you play TF2 I'm sure you will be able to see how this is similar to being a "friendly".
---
This was sure, a lobby full of teamers in solo showdown, but this was different, everyone was teaming, everyone was friendly, nobody was attacking anyone, that seems to be a one in a million chance of happening.
---
I think you should have savored the rare moment, and should've let the others do the same.
---
You were selfish in ruining their fun for a few trophies, no matter what you say, that is a fact.
---
Lol thats why i hate randoms
---
Perfect 
---
why
---
They could do like overwatch does and create animated shorts with life, I think the style in this game could really fit Pixar like animated shorts 
---
T H I C C O C H E T
---
leon on one side, and phoenix(crow) at the other side
---
On mobile go to the subreddit and click the three dots on the top right corner
---
thn i live at the phoenix'(crow) side (north)
---
Well it went global so I was right 
---
I‚Äôm waiting for the same thing lol. Those mega boxes will be much more valuable if I can get him 
---
no worries\^\^ the idea is to also make the doubler apply for star token so the value gap between normal and big boxes gets smaller
---
You can talk all nice, still your saying ‚Äújoin the team‚Äù every single match at 450+ brawler trophy‚Äôs look like this. in skull creek you will either see all dyna‚Äôs/franks/mortis.  certain maps. are for certain brawlers. although you can‚Äôt seem to understand that it‚Äôs SOLO showdown. So no, it‚Äôs no fact.  ‚Äúruin the game‚Äù yet your the one here that would have joined the team.  i‚Äôd rather backstab ;)

Bull require no skills

LMFAO
---
What?
---
I like the concept, but make the super a thrown barrier (passable by himself and allies), so that if dragged back to middle, it cancels. I think the bottles shouldn't do very much damage, but the middle does most.
---
u mean we must protect phoenix (crow) from leon, haven't u seen "phoenix" at the north side?
