---
No Power-Ups
---
Middle of Thousand Lakes
---
Leon Only
---
I hope you're only joking
---
THIS IS EPIC 
---
Since it‚Äôs a freemium game, they would then need a way for people to earn these skins without buying.  I‚Äôm sure they have some data to show that less people would get the skins then cause they could earn them naturally
---
The company is way too greedy to add something like this.
---
And Shelly, Daryl, bull
---
Wouldn't those work like the regular game, just stop aiming with the joysticks
---
r/engrish
---
So didja make it?
---
How do u make these??
---
I love it 
---
Also I think there should be affordable skins, like panda Nita and golden barley (30 gems each). Then there's the visual-only skins for casual players and more expensive minor-ability boosting expensive ones

Why can't he shoot popcorn?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Who's idea did he copy? I never saw an idea like this, except this one idea where it was duels, but it was completely different from this one.
---
Awesome!
---
it's not like they're forcing you to do the quests
---
These abilities are also for skins that you buy with gems
---
No habla poor English 
---
Wow! 
---
This is a good idea
---
You should get 5% of the gems this skin makes
---
Disgusting, they will be banned from leongang immediately
---
Your comment history says otherwise.
---
Supercell please add this!
---
seria de grande ajuda!
---
Was credit given to the creator of the image?

I'm at less than 1k and gotten spike.  **ü§∑**

I love the idea of having that brawler roster there
---
Next you'll tell me that Jessie's dog is actually a gun turret!

Here before this blows up

There should be color PICKER but otherwise this is good

Really like this guy too, maybe a bit OP but not sure what to change tbh. Nice

I agree, the old ones were much better

This is pretty good!

I am from spain, and the game do not connect.. for hours.. is there maintenance?

Or maybe call it "Parrot Crow"

Good bot
---
I remember your cat from earlier... good job they look super real!
---
Comments say it‚Äôs u/mutress

Not good idea

Thank you for this.

Yes it does.

Invisibility isn't unique or creative

Grouping ftl
---
"Humor"
---
And rico, barley, dynamike, colt, el primo.
---
I like it a lot
---
Some players spawn with 3 boxes, some players have to fight for 1 energy cube. That's why I hate Skull Creek (more than Cavern Churn)
---
Or release it for the Switch ... 
---
Those skins deserve that price, because of their detail and animations.
---
But really, i don't think supercell will add skins cheaper than 80 gems anymore.
---
r/unexpectedcommunism
---
Incredibly Op. Maybe less everything
---
Ok
---
Surprise they haven‚Äôt added in quests yet... the game could use them tbh.

This is fucking legit

Really nice!
---
Pretty sure that is just a noob bro (Noobs r worse than bots).
---
Naw what they need to do is nerf the other legendaries again, crow is fine he runs fast as hell
---
Was good. Have seen.
---
Let's do it
---
Me like this
---
This is a really good skin idea! Very creative and I love how the bear is a polar bear üëç
---
Yeah I think that those skins should be 150 but I would just like to see more 30 gem skins made.
---
I can hear this image

She's not a tank anyway
---
It's not just because someone else already did that means that I copied, I always had this idea, but I did it now, and I have many other ideas of ways yet, in the coming days I'll post more
---
Ik, but supercell needs to fix matchmaking because its garbage 
---
Lmfao it's not even yours, the watermark is literally in the background. Anyways here's the original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/atfx9w/art_idea_concept_detective_colt/?utm_source=reddit-android.
---
I really hope supercell is taking note of all of these ideas. I love brawlstars a lot, but it‚Äôd be nice to have some spice like this added to it. 
---
You would probably explain it better, my editing is limited :)
---
I will also support colt
---
A lot of people use colt when i play on my second account and most of them suck so free kill lol.
---
No
---
I meant unique as in different and complex, like what the guy.
---
Wow what a lil bitch 
---
They should add a hardcore mode where all guidance features are removed. I.e. Autoaim, immunity (or at least significantly reduced in duration) and the manual aim guidance. That would be a game that I‚Äôd be interested playing :D
---
Really cool idea
---
Not just primo, even rangers stay to fight rather than go safe. Looks like fighting near spawn is too smart for most. So dumb, playing for 2 weeks so far, 400 trophies and I see it so soooo often.

Watermark something that's not yours?

Yeah im actually just. ....i feel bad :(

Nice
---
online in switch, to play online you have to pay (its cheap tho, but paid anyways so)
---
lights would be a cool concept if they replaced bushes. for example you are unseen in shadows but maybe get 1-2 more squares of vision than you would in a bush. that might nerf bos star power tho
---
his super better be WILD

Maybe 30% is a bit much but I‚Äôd love to be able to effectively play my only legendary

Yeah I know how you feel been playing since beta and only have crow and it‚Äôs like I can‚Äôt use him because Leon and spike just destroy him easily, I really want him to be able to not run away from fights when going against Leon and spike but I don‚Äôt feel like he‚Äôll ever get the buff he deserves. Spike and Leon tho need a desperate nerf.

Thank you comrade

**Mom I'm scared**

I contacted support and they pretty much told me too bad. I know I played the game before 2019, used the skin but they told me my account was created after Dec 31st 2018. I even downloaded a tool to see when I installed the game and it was in 2018.

Consider throwing a baseball at someone right in front of you. It's gonna hurt like hell 
---
But consider throwing that same baseball only the person is 60 feet away.
---
 It'll still hurt but it won't hurt as much as in point blank range. 
---
If we want to increase skill ceiling just remove the power cubes from the game

Wish this was real. My Leon bou could use a cheap 30 gem skin

Your language sounds like it come from a mumble rap community.

also the rocket of Brock has 4 guns to shoot and only shoots 3

Most ideas I see on this reddit honestly aren‚Äôt great but I do really love this one and could totally see it being added to the game. I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs not another stupid Nita skin

hold up, poco can hit the same guy twice with 1 attack?

Thanks, I will edit the title to match that.

what ? how often do you reach Level 5 ? Level 15 ? etc. etc. You get the level pack when you reach that level, WOW!

Hell yea

Crazy true point u got there

Such a bad aim. That's why people team because they are Noobs and can't win on their own

Omg that must be a PAIN

This is honestly a great idea. I‚Äôd personally love to see it in the game. üëç
---
Well, that's another story
---
I tilted this much on. MY. OWN
---
Dude... your really not thinking this through lmao. Yes every other battle royal game a system like the power crates. Tiered weapons so that it‚Äôs desirable to kill enemies and take their stuff. For fights and movement  to happen there has to be an advantage that balances out the risk of dying. If everyone in fortnite had the same weapon they would all just wait and hide until the storm got tiny, and then it would be a bloodbath with the last person to get noticed winning. This is because offensive engagement is a high risk 0 reward. You really don‚Äôt understand game theory and motivation. 
---
 I don't know if or how you program this,
---
Assuming your right analog stick is for regular aiming, I feel like holding a button like L1/L2 or R1/R2 should make your right analog stick  switch from regular aim to super aim. After all, you use your right thumb for both aims and you can't use both at the same times.
---
He got a red nose, Im sure he drinks a lot lol.
---
I don't think so. Brock does way more at an even longer range
---
o sector topkek told me ur finding the sprites in game if possible could you link me them?
---
Ah yes, it's ToNita The Tiger. 
---
Haha lol dumb. Imagine having a brawler that dies not have a hat. This was made by dynamike gang 
---
Did you meantion RANGE nerf?
---
Genius meme 
---
Repost, stolen.
---
But not everyone in bs has the same weapon. Not every brawler would be good for sitting in a bush also people try to sit in bushes currently and it doesn‚Äôt work because people tag bushes to see if players are hiding in them. Players would play the exact same way they normally do but with balanced gameplay because there isn‚Äôt one dude walking around with 12000 hp and dealing 4500 dps 
---
I don't think so. Some people team because they can't win on their own. In many occasions, I have taken the one of the teamers to double digit health and still the others won't kill the low health one. What do you call it? Loyalty?  Sometimes, whatever you do, taking down teamers is hard. I quit playing solo showdown above 350 trophies. Its so bad. 7 throwers against me ( penny), Shelly and Frank. This the worst case I have seen in skull creek. 
---
The grass in between us too small but good edit lol
---
You cant win on your own
---
My man! This is good art, but slap a watermark on it! You know what happened last time...
---
I don't know if i should do a full unlocked roster ;P
---
Why is it marked spoiler??
---
if it is possible than would love a video clip. Cause I can understand making this tactic theoretically true, but in game the bot might act differently. So a video clip would be better in my opinion

Ah yes the five elements, cacti ruled by Spike Squad, water ruled by Dyna-Daredevils, cavern blocks ruled by Barley Band, Barrels ruled by Darryl Deck, boxes ruled by Boombox Brocks, and finally Bushes by Bush Bulls. 
---
But one day the Barely Band and Dyna-Daredevils made an alliance called the Thrower gang, to gang up on the Bush Bulls, so they called Shotgun Shellys to reinforce them. But the Mortis Gang attacked the Thrower Gang wiping them out leaving one, thus creating the last Daredevil

I just typed in that after you, I'm sorry I did not know

Technically speaking, that's a strategy that applies to majority of movement super brawlers (Darryl, El Primo, Piper) so it doesn't really make Crow "OP", it's a strategy that applies to a lot of brawlers.

Seriously this would make the game more interesting.

It happened to me only twice and I am playing for six months but yea if the atack is aligned perfectly and the person moves kinda diagonally he gets hit twice

It's an edit

I only got Leon. It will take a loooong time to get the rest

A\* for effort! Suggestions:Even though there is are bodies of water at the sides, there should be more water in the map.

Glad to know that im not the only one

Ehh kine master dude it said on top right

There is an tiket event now so that won't be necessary

Hmmmmmmm

yeah so Jessie is a chick

They will definitely add this to bs when the game will about to die as they did in cr and coc
---
1/0
---
Mine works fine and my whole family is on the internet...
---
Yea and they can add special quests where you can recieve those pins and btw I have seen some people asking for actual brawler skins on profile pics ex: pheonix crow and your design just looks awesome and seems to fit all of it 10/10
---
Say it 
---
Alreasy loads of brick skins tho 
---
Everyone on the opposite team is tank and then they have a long rang thrower.
---
You hit ready and brawlers at same time
---
Profile picture should show with your name on end screens 
---
Nice concept! See you on the front page!
---
You spoke my point yourself.the more rare brawler the more versatile it is.thats why they are legendaries.versatality is a good point in everygame i think.
---
even worth it to jail break just for a portrait mode??
---
So you were cheating?
---
I WORK FOR T-SERIES
---
Skeletons?
---
I‚Äôve got that too, I don‚Äôt know if it gets any lower.
---
Bo*
---
With 3800 hp and 600 damage it would be pretty balanced
---
JUST DO IT
---
The character should be the same one, if not one would have an advantage over the other. Also i think it would be interesting if duels is only available for high trophy players (400 trophies) and bet trophies from 10-25 trophies
---
What happens if you buy it tho. Quite curious
---
Yeah but they probably won't since it doesn't get them money
---
Wow people really don't like that suggestion 
---
Hush Penny needs to be OP now
---
Um maybe not for colt
---
I was a disciple of Shaggy and Mortis themselves.
---
I really curious about that. But.... I don‚Äôt have money üòÇ
---
I really like it and the pins are a really good idea, it's an A+ idea in fact 
---
It would be amazing to see [these](https://i.redd.it/djq4nfa0m7h21.png) turned into pins eventually too
---
It could even give end game players something to spend some gold on
---
BULL WHAT ARE YOU DOING
---
This idea for the star power is pretty but the range should be like 4 tiles
---
For thicco

I like that you used the old badges! They really should put them back some way or another

I love this idea.

Yeah her super is nice and would be 100x better like I said if you had follow up but the people I play with half the time are braindead lol  as for crow I will update this post when I get him haha as for Tara I bought that random mythic thing only reason I got her. All I need is the sniper chick then 2 mythics and 3 legendaries and I have all characters ( oh and the rewards ones I still need 3 from there)

Can you show some gameplay using the ps4 controller? Would be awesome

I agree this is a popular suggestion and I've been doing it myself for quite a while. However I'm growing quite impatient with myself(Piper please XD).

Normally token doubler is the best thing to spend gems on since I gives a box every 5 gems, but mega boxes under 50 gems have better value

I think just saying "Teaming in SSD isn't allowed anymore" would be a good start. Mostly there is one braindead soul that thinks teaming is a good idea and starts it all. Teaming always needs 2 persons and if one of them is a good lad and follows the game rules, there won't be teaming.

Looks like a fun Bounty map :) But you should take away some of the water, and make sure there are no 1-tile paths.

So if they buy stuff then it doesn't matter if we stop playing? :v

You just have to move your analog stick back to the default position.

You‚Äôre creepy
---
Flamethrowers are actually, realistically speaking, 2 tiles wide at most
---
What if we could buy a skin in time? Like it takes all of your gems and puts the skin in your inventory but you can't use it unless you open boxes and all gems you get from there get directed to the skin. Or if you're broke af and can spend money in the game only after the offer ends or something just to have that little backup so you don't miss out on a neat skin
---
Yes officer, this post right herr
---
We‚Äôll be back for oppy 
---
If we stop playing for 2-4 days they will realise they failed and then they potentially fix it then we continue playing without losing account or anything purchased.

Make sense? If not I‚Äôm too tired to argue.

THANK SSSSSS

#crappydesigns

Fun Fact : That can be done with bear and turret as well ;) 
---
I am surprised this meme wasn‚Äôt removed yet for being ‚Äúinappropriate‚Äù, as the mods call it.
---
Supercell should optimize their game for mobile devices rather than banning people for using third party software to avoid lag.

Very cool idea
---
Legit though this was official skin at first, amazing!
---
That‚Äôs seems fair
---
Bombs Away!
---
I suggest the name Twinback cavern.
---
No,  im 5
---
I disagree.I think autoaim requires skill maybe just as much as normal shooting becasue it doesn't take the enemies movement into account which makes it very situational and its up to the player to use it at the right time.
---
Yes
---
Just one tip with Tara, when you use your super rush towards the enemy brawlers. The temptation is to keep your distance but if you ensure that you have three shots loaded up before you use your super and then get in close to the enemy you shred. Basically you want to hit them with all three cards. Three cards at level one is over 1100 damage without any brawl boxes (if you're in showdown) multiplied by three shots is over 3300, plus the super damage will melt most brawlers. 
---
HYPE
---
Skills.
---
Or Lucky Luke?
---
I applaud the effort but dang it would suck to be playing this, literally no satisfaction at the beginning and it gives a huge advantage to higher move speed brawlers.
---
U stole it
---
Find the source and give credit before posting 
---
that was me
---
i made the concept art go check my profile
---
The game definitely needs some sort of club features because right now they are no incentives at all for being in a club.
---
I‚Äôd probably buy this if it was in the game. 
---
big oof
---
F(uck the exploit is gone)
---
I would love if there were a progression help that's not just trophy road and boxes
---
Ok, you can't understand. I mean, you think autoaim needs a buff, I get you don't get simple things.
---
Let's go slowly, so you understand.
---
Ranged brawlers NEVER use autoaim.
---
Short range brawlers abuse autoaim.
---
At short range, fights don'r recquire skill.
---
You want those fights to recquire less skill.
---
You are buffing short range brawlers by making them easier to use, while long range brawlers don't get any advantage as they never autoaim.
---
So next time, just aim and stop autoaiming next to a box. 
---
Your idea has been suggested from the beginning, it sucks and will never be changed. Get over it
---
Nice job! It looks very cool
---
"And stay down" isnt that bull???
---
Oh ok
---
Wow nice name thx
---
It looks awesome, but it lacks the hat :((
---
There old enough to be in the hunger games though.
---
Definetly worth 150 gems
---
Put him in the game as a remodel
---
Yep
---
Actually looks deadly üòà
---
Rip
---
This looks AMAZING!! I really hope they'll make this into an actual skin &gt;\_&lt;

I opened the 4K chest the other day having 16/24 brawlers and not unlocking any in more than a week: got nothing. This game is getting to my nerves. Also, I opened something like 15 normal chests today and nothing. I‚Äôm missing all epics. Where‚Äôs my Pam? :((( 
---
I feel you a lot, mate 
---
Great!
---
All I want is Mortis :(
---
Can I ask how do you get the Brawler name and picture beside your username? 
---
Stfu
---
thank you \^\^
---
It's not your skill. It's the bull's stupidity.
---
More like a year if he has a life
---
Hat looks a little funky. No hate though.
---
You have gene bruh stop 
---
This should be a skin!
---
It‚Äôs surrealism Humor
---
That's right. This is fanart that I discussed with the person who commented on my article.  
---
Currently, clown Mortis, 13th Friday elfrimo, Musketeer penny is finished sketching. You can look forward to the color coming in soon :) 
---
Well at least this person is gaining trophies for you
---
I feel like they will do something about teaming and then release another thrower.

Just go work for supercell already
---
What about second upvote? 
---
Look at the amount of bos 
---
i dont think all new content will be in the pass, if we ever get the pass, dont worry.
---
That's just encouraging the use of Auto-aim
---
Thas been happening to me for the past 7 games already.
---
It‚Äôs sad Supercell isn‚Äôt going to add this they basically only add maps from the community like come these ideas are so good
---
Lmao has a triangle chest
---
What about crow's unique poison? 
---
Creepy...
---
How long is this conversation gonna be?
---
I'd give him a hard hat
---
ok so basically im fronky
---
Bo, as in the brawler
---
I don't think it's that random. I think when it was introduced they said meteors would target max damage...so if there are brawlers close together it's more likely to hitting there, or if someone stays still for a long period it increases the chance of a meteor hitting that spot
---
 I have no gems, but I would get gems and then pour them all on this amazing take on Tara!
---
If they would have fought you one at a time when you were in the final arena, they would have destroyed you
---
I tried to use hat Mortis but then, the letter Top Hat Mortis shows on the hat so I hadn‚Äôt any other choice
---
 I'd like to let you know, but it took me a while to get here, too. I hope you practice hand painting a lot. I practiced nude Crockie and color mechanics a lot at the university. Perhaps if you are interested in this way, you will be able to enjoy such fun hobbies at some point. 
---
No that's the anti bull zone
---
This is really cool. 100% would buy. Hope they add it!
---
my dream!
---
Wtf ._.
---
So basically make bs even MORE like TF2?
---
I like it!
---
SHOCKING! SEE HOW THIS MAN MADE SUPERCELL GIVE HIM A BRAWLER WITH JUST ONE SIMPLE TRICK!!! MOBILE GAME COMPANIES HATE HIM
---
Any brawler shouldn¬¥t be able to see players behind walls 
---
Ni√±o, primero aprende a usar Reddit. Reportado
---
Buff crow 
---
Thank god you water marked it 
---
True the normal attack description is pretty much Greek signs being shown to a 4 yr old
---
yus
---
That would be tons of fun. Personally, I‚Äôd prefer it over brawl ball. Brawl ball is kind of irritating, especially with all the boxes and junk in the way. 
---
Nothing wrong with teaming 
---
They say win by any means necessary I‚Äôve teamed up plenty of times to take down a 10 power bull or el primo 
---
I hope you step on a Lego and choke on your food 
---
False
---
Press F to pay respects
---
This... is soo good ! :D
---
That happened to me before I was super surprised
---
This just sucks
---
The muffler part is rude, but... they do say honesty first.
---
Yes me too.
---
Fronk 
---
im curious
---
you can get banned for this, remove it before supercell sees this
---
I try to trophy push my Dynamike, and sometimes, only showdown and gem grab are available. I‚Äôll load into solo SD and get teamed on a few matches, run down my trophies, then quit. However, when heist or brawl ball are available, I can get a good team and level up like crazy just winning heist matches. So yeah, brawl ball and heist are the only good modes right now, unless you‚Äôre a Primo main.

&gt;i keep getting killed by invisible leons and literally can‚Äôt do shit about it
---
That's the same with every other brawler in game except bulls or shellys or other leons. They can't do shit about it either.
---
Good that there's Credits on Pic.
---
pls wish me luck when i open my mega box i want Mortis one of my favorites brawlers
---
:( any idea how your mythic % can increase further? Anyway how many trophies do you have. 
---
I'll make sure to remember that next time, tnx
---
Robo rumble is the best mode for token farming, use it all up if you want to
---
Thanks for telling me this btw!
---
Such ana amazing exploit!^^/s
---
maybe they will save it for a skin for alfa or beta players
---
This is very good
---
Well this week is a completely different map. But yes they patched the glitch. 
---
Now, we wait. 
---
Feast or Famine 2.0 baby!! This is a very scary map. üò®

Way better than White Crow skin

My nephew's 3300 trophies 16 brawlers
---
My friend's 3400 trophies 16 brawlers TOO lol i'm frickin unlucky
---
The Legendary odds will Increase the more boxes You'll open, Other brawler rarity odds will always remain the same. I guess everytime you open around 40 boxes your leggy odds Will increase by 0.0048%
---
I'm playing since October 2017, 9.7k Trophies!

Where would people spown at

I didn't know Robert Kraft plays brawl stars

Damn I wish I could help you but I have no tickets rn.

That's right! I draw with a wacom tablet in photoshop :)

I use photoshop :)

Awww, wish u could help me too

They stabbed him
---
No furries please
---
Thank you! :)
---
He is irrelevant to this.
---
Yeah I saw she's good at soccer stadium and especially after a score use ult at beginning as they rush then triple card can usually kill with that combo and have super again for a 2nd score if needed so far I already got mine power 2 
---
It's a new Fronk.

Last oneüòÇ

Looks so accurate and Cute! Great job!üòç

lol thank you! :)

You can walk there too

That probably is true, but they shouldn't be playing a team of all lvl 1s.

So cool,I want one of that ,best brawler#thicochetgang

Thank you! I actually tried it in red first, but I felt he looked a little more mysterious this way :)

Nerf Reaper... Wait... Wrong game.
---
Yay. r/woooosh
---
Too much grass imo
---
That is awful, which brawler was it?
---
Nice pineapple üëå
---
They will need to consider te range/map size, otherwise if you kill someone of the enemy team you could just camp in the back untill the time is up
---
I'd say post it anyway! Comments, good or bad, have always helped me improve :)
---
What do you mean? Regular Jessie looks like she‚Äôs in Kindergarten! üòÖ

---
thank you for idea!  It was a really interesting conversation.
---
 I'm glad you saw this picture.  :)
---
We weren't even teaming against anyone lol. Do you think this harmed anyone? No.

He‚Äôs a lier it‚Äôs to obvious

Send this to sans with no context 
---
It's decided. I choose ......!
---
Yes, but I think that throwers can go to the bush to defend, and they are safe because they are behind the wall
---
Dont judge me, i hardly ever play robo rumble, and if i do i dont have friends to play with (they still play clash royale lol) 
---
Yeah, He watermarked the original post.
---
Once I had more chance to have a legendary than an epic but I still got the last epic I needed
---
I‚Äôve been on vaca during the merge. There isn‚Äôt much I could do.
---
 No. Your idea goes beyond mine. I found your painting quite interesting, too.

Sorry English is not my first language so I don't know what I types wrong

Btw, He does not have any subs that have reddit. So he takes chances and takes other people‚Äôs work, You can easily see it in the comments.
---
this sub and discord big sad

the idiots even unvoted you. wow. some people just cant take up their own faults
---
Finally
---
Thanks for the reply
---
Looks like these idiots all shot each other (like if u get it)
---
This doesn't explain the watermark tho
---
no
---
I assume he/she had tried that.
---
Brawl Stars give you a chance to don't roll in bushes, maybe there is primo
---
KairosTime did a tier list and he placed S tier in literally every mode and got the perfect score of 18. Leon got a score of 18 and he was nerfed, expect Darryl to get nerfed as well.
---
Link to tierlist: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGMUUdyzf8
---
I think that website is like redbubble, where anyone can upload designs.  I think is the one person stealing.  The company should take it down once they see your complaint.
---
next sketch is no furry :)
---
 I don't know why people hate Furry. Don't they see Disney animations? 
---
Oh god a furry
---
Well played, perfect timing with your ult!
---
Bold of you bold
---
To nedal on.
---
Is that a bad thing?
---
yeah im DYING for a tara skin but i am curious to see how they make her even better w a new model
---
Elon Musk approves.
---
supercell said that teaming is allowed and its a strategy to win.
---
they don‚Äôt want 1 tile gaps
---
update in March 100%
---
Brawl stalk maybe next week/ or the week after
---
Too overpowered
---
Yeah 
---
Is this a glitch?
---
What is much in that robo thing? I accidentally entered a game with 10 tickets and survived 3. 15 the first time playing. I got 210 tokens. Was it a waste? I hope not üò≠
---
I love your art work! If you have some free time and are willing to help I would need a redesign of the brawler drawing for my brawler concept. If you want to help tell me plz! üòÄ
---
Ligma brawls lol 
---
I love you both
---
Leon didn't get anything too
---
He looks like a skeleton but his face isn't *see-through*
---
Are you ashamed of your total trophies?
---
Morris Gang
---
Weird flex but ok
---
I should get the flair "Exploit Master" at this point (Yes I found the robo boss exploit too)
---
Maybe there could be a selection of different color schemes you could choose from.
---
(They'd all be the same price.)
---
He definitely needs a buff
---
Whats the diff nothin reall cool abt it fr
---
Signa balls
---
You're telling me? It's actually lower... 0.0480 So....yeah, rip me
---
jebe ti ?
---
Fronk fronk, fronk.
---
Well if you get to close to someone you might die and he only does 1200 damage 
---
And it doesn‚Äôt take the super the way you think it does
---
If you are a bull with or with put your super I would just get the ability to run once ( unless I keep using it on you)
---
Sort of, I mean, for a first time, really good! As you get better you start averaging 3:50 but I wouldn‚Äôt consider it a waste
---
I would buy this
---
True
---
I don't get it lol
---
Why does he need a remodel?! He looks ok
---
this is my clan mates replay and he said i can use it
---
How is colt related to Jessie and Pam? We know Pam is the mother, Jessie is the daughter. What is his relationship? 
---
So creative! Nice work lol
---
gameplay vid when?
---
And not to mention sleep with the fishes is crows 
---
I like it because it has colors that haven't really been used in other Shelly skins.
---
Are you the same artist that posted astronaut brock? Love your work!
---
My Cousin just started playing and he said His legendary chance is at 0.1 or something like that.
---
Colt is the son of Pam
---
Omg yes please!
---
I don't have a star power :(
---
But pretty cool!
---
 guys, he's a trawler. He follows all my works around telling all kinds of lies. I was drawing a piece next to my girlfriend when I heard that this trawler was lying. If you're curious, visit the Art Station in that picture. This is a picture of me, Jiun ki.

WtfüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
When you have 0 poco trophies 
---
Yeah, I used to have the same percentage  when I only had all trophy road, rare and superrares brawlers and anything else
---
It decreases when you get brawlers...I got 2 Mythics and it decreased my legendary chance a lot.
---
It is called scandalous kick
---
Oh noice
---
Bro I'm at 5k and in friendly battles my friends have leon at 2k but I haven't.

You mean to tell me You use darryl LIKE BULL?! That's not how he worksüòÇ

 I cut you off. It's hard to accept more nonsense. It's really ugly to lie about not being mine even though my Reddit ID is left in that picture. I only put this picture on the 'art station' 'redith' and 'naver blog'. My name is jyun ki. If you really want to fight me, get ready for a lawsuit. I have mentioned my country and real name, and I can appoint an international lawyer.

Bull+Pam=Jessie+colt+penny?

That's just a guess though
---
Hahahaha doing this exploit while listening Benny Hill must be soo funny
---
 There can be no evidence. Because it's my drawing. That trawler lies, following all my posts.

Not all bulls goes to enemy spawn with 10 gems

And the other teammate is mortis

Yo that‚Äôs green Kirby #thataintspike

Nah, just didn't want to give out my username.

You should try to draw a treasure, chest themed Darryl.
---
They removed life leech because of new players
---
All other modifiers SPAWNS SOMETHING either thats a meteor that damages you or mushrooms that heals you, but life leech PASSIVELY affects you 
---
From new players perspective, It WAS confusing (also I have a poll going on about life leech and event modifier)
---
I loved life leech so sad 
---
We can't always have what we want
---
A max Rico and max Colt does as well
---
that‚Äôs what i thought. i wonder why he‚Äôs making such stupid accusations ü§îü§î
---
This is a whole new character imo
---
NO
---
No. 1664 trophies is very low.
---
Thanks friend, I hope and be supported and in some future be improved and implemented to the game
---
That‚Äôs a good idea. Maybe he can have low health to balance him and he could have a natural rechargeable super like Darryl and whenever you use it you get more health for like 5 seconds 
---
I mean compared to my club
---
Oh, thx! :D

ask yourself this question at 5k

this reply is severely underrated, here have an upvote

You have to spin anti-clockwise for it to work
---
When the gas is lit, it does an initial explosion and then burns for 5 seconds, damaging anyone touched by it
---
Isn‚Äôt he pretty much already a cowboy? That was the initial idea of the game. 
---
???

like it baffles me sooo much like howww??? hahahah. i just have the worst luck.

That‚Äôs the part where you have to know how to play him and be tactical. If you have a coordinated team to do that. You get picks left and right.
---
I think you should be able to see some more of the face, just a tip, as it really characterize the character. Maybe do it without the head top (I don‚Äôt know how it‚Äôs called), or make the glass transparent
---
Looks really stupid tbh
---
So uncivilized 
---
Bold of you to assume crow needs a buff
---
not what im trying to say. i was saying. Your at 4000 with 14 brawlers and complaining üòÇüòÇüòÇ im happy you wasted your time **with** this TERRIBLE game for 4000 cups.

---
Yes, maybe a special for the day when the humans had their first step on the moon! :)
---
Nah, the game has moved on, the exploit has been removed, Supercell shoud revert the scores to reflect the modern era.
---
you just cant read, litteraly forgot 1 word you should be able to understand it perfectly fine. 
---
Ok and your point it‚Äôs not risky 
---
Vainglory works a bit differently. They monetize with skins and new hero unlocks, and they have a free hero rotation. They also have talents available in certain casual game modes (talents are basically star powers but there‚Äôs 3 per hero that you can unlock and swap between) so in their battle pass you can get glory (basically tokens if you could buy new brawlers with tokens) ICE (basically gems) new heroes and new skins. Then there are chests which contain variants of the above. 
---
Brawl stars does not have nearly enough skins or brawlers to do anything remotely similar so the skins would have to be hated behind that one season (if you miss it you will never get it) gems, coins, boxes, etc. We would just get more of the same because the monetization style in brawl stars sucks compares to other games 
---
Mortis and crow once, NOT RISKY? 
---
Pretty similar haha
---
Yesssss I've been waiting for thissssssüòçüòçüòçüòç

Your that random that everyone hates
---
Mortis used to be the best in robo 
---
I need this skin 
---
Ok, sorry, I'm not good at English
---
have much fear, Mortis is here!

I remember following the thread and seeing someone suggesting this skin. I think it's just amazing you took the time to respond and go through with it! Great work!

be careful it might get stolen

i called it, another exploit

I've always hated the randomness of the mods. This is just further proof that they need to fix them.
---
Well if i got a new brawler and other teammate also has a new brawler and the third one doesnt have a new one. Why they cant play like that? It happens
---
I imagine this post seen by brock's perspective. All of the comments here will be against el primo and gene lol
---
I just know word"pokemon".. sorry
---
You mean El Atraco Primo
---
No worries fam, I got Crow, my first and only legendary at 6k. Haven't gotten one since. Am at 9k now. Don't give up hope, but don't get your hopes too high either.

Just for protection, you use turret for escape and the bullet aoe will help you so much from 4 min to 5 because you have almost always the turret
---
xD
---
Lol
---
hahaha
---
Oh i forgot i said that lol sry if u want dont upvote just dont downvote pls 
---
**Fabulous!*&amp;
---
This would make so much sense lol. Why is this not a thing? :P
---
 Nah
---
That sucks. 
---
They already have with dynamikes dynajump 
---
Homie even said some, "I dId'nT kNoW iT wAs SoMeoNE elSe's".
---
happy cake day btw
---
Poor Supercell.
---
do you have like a certain program or website that you design these on? bc I'm looking into crating some new skin ideas myself and the only way i can think to do it is on paper.
---
Wow your skinart is in main thumbnail! How do you find it? Thanks!
---
#LETS GO
---
What do you want to do to her
---
Fronk
---
I can‚Äôt go more than 3 letters though 
---
Got mine to 500 as level 8
---
This is one I would have to actually buy :)
---
#Im maining rn
---
So, by your logic, would Cavern Churn not be Cavern Churn if Supercell decides to rework the map into that? (This map was too similar to Cavern Churn before the update)
---
because if they were, they would actually try
---
same I played on and off but I started in beta and still have no legendary. 
---
Bud I was at 4169 now I'm at 4088 
---
I hope they don't add emotes like the ones from Clash Royale. Spinning after getting a kill is toxic enough.
---
Thats sad just sad
---
Copyright Stars‚Ñ¢
---
Wanna know how i lost that much 
---
r/twentycharacterlimit
---
Nope
---
no thats luck
---
I think the game is using aimbot this time
---
He he I can play on phone
---
It‚Äôs a mad furry. Love it
---
Chameleon eyes!!!!
---
I have plenty max brawler 
---
Didn't maxed Dynamike 
---
yeah totally you have it all figured out
---
The legend says Robo rumble is named Exploit in the code
---
#we all know you drew it
---
Lel...fortnite skin
---
lol ok
---
Actually yes I'm curious
---
Love it &lt;3
---
Thank you Gene, very cool!
---
Ransoms can be awful. But maybe ur shite anyways 
---
Can we do Japanese version? 
---
OMG YES!!!!
---
Tall Stars
---
I mean its better then a skin that js thesame thing
---
Grandma done went and got the shotgun. You best be going.
---
Dem skillz
---
I absolutely love Mortis! Keep up the good work!
---
Goooooooooood
---
He‚Äôs not an a in Gem grabs tf?
---
I honestly like this idea really I do but the PROBLEM is that EVERYONE! Will have a legendary now you may think that is fine here are some reasons why I think this isn't such a good idea
---
1. Your gonna see the same legendary brawlers on showdown
---
2. Beginners &amp; others who haven't used them will now have full access to choose whatever brawler.
---
3. Also, all the effort into getting those other brawlers are to waste when you could just try them in a friendly
---
**THIS IS IN MY OPINION I AGREE WITH THIS AND UPVOTED HERE IS WHAT I THINK OF IT**
---
Thanks ;) 
---
Thanks!
---
Why did I laugh so hard at this
---
Lol! I finally got to a see a real life scenario of that comment!
---
He was making a point saying it‚Äôs possible 2 get higher then that using this strategy 
---
Ah ok
---
Showdown maps only in showdown square
---
It's because of the retarded barley... I would do the same if I would have a retarded barley playing in RR...
---
Good idea!
---
&gt; "Dynamike can now use the concussive force of **his attacks** *and* **Super** to propel himself in the air, even over walls!"
---
Hate say it's will fakers
---
True lol! He sucks as a brawler, but is just so ANNOYING!
---
Ahhhhhhhhh, WHAT DID YOU DO TO HER!?!!!?!?!!!!!??!¬°¬ø¬ø¬°¬°¬ø¬ø¬°?!¬ø
---
This seems an interesting idea to have the center covered 
---
You would throw a match over a random? 
---
It looks good but I think it's a little bit unnecessary. The normal Colt I think is already a cowboy. 
---
I stars playing this game since the firts day, before the time line with the brawlers doesn't exist. And 4 that I have Dynamike and Bo with 1k thropies xdüòÇ thx‚ù§Ô∏è
---
It's removed?
---
Yump is number two in the world. I posted the replay earlier 
---
No, Its 6;15 had a match end at exactly 6:15 today, for max tickets
---
Why?
---
XdddüòÇ
---
What the heck are you talking about?!? What ‚Äúbox‚Äù? I would chill out on the caps if you would not ACT SO STUPID
---
Bas mamu im jebem sve kradu
---
What survey
---
ü§î
---
Oh, ok sorry for the misconception. I checked out some of your brawlers and they are also amazing. Keep up the good work.
---
I thought bull was the father
---
I hardly consider this an exploit solely because it‚Äôs so difficult to pull off. You cannot fail even 1 jump
---
I‚Äôll play robo rumble with you. But I just drank a Pepsi. And now I‚Äôm horny. Do you think you can massage my penis and genitals. And I come come on the floor all my white gooey jizz. I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm just really horny 
---
lmao that would be perfect. Although I hear there‚Äôs a new exploit with Dynamike and his star power which makes it possible to get max time again. Much harder to do though.
---
Looks cool
---
rreeppoosstt
---
You can literally prove yourself wrong right now. 6:15. 
---
Atleast is not a animal skin.Good skin and we see his eyes.
---
JUST DO IT!
---
What do you mean?
---
Precious!
---
just tell me how many brawlers you got with money 1,2 or 3
---
Yeah some bones maybe lol i went crazy with em
---
WHY?! \*insert the song\*
---
pleeeease add this skin!! why don't you guys add any features/skins from this subreddit? they look soo cool! 
---
A predator. He EL PRIMOOOOOS right into prison with his 12 Gems.
---
Bot
---
I w a n t t h i s s o b a d
---
What I am SAYING is that I have bad memory and I cant REMEMBER how many thats why I put 1-3
---
Very well done!
---
This is why when I'm one or two trophies away from a milestone I just go into showdown and bushcamp to make sure that I minimize the chances of losing trophies.
---
cool, seems like something you‚Äôd tbf
---
heres my team code: XRWWUCVU
---
This is real btw I didn‚Äôt edit this üòÇ
---
Tbf?
---
Yeah we definitly need another furry. Good artwork though
---
‚Äòto be fair‚Äô its an abbreviation 
---
50% usually means connection issues for me
---
Thats cuz primo is a lil bit faster than most characters
---
I think i laughed at this longer that i should.
---
She already foxy
---
Thank you.
---
Now he has even more ability to elbow into the enemy team with the gems.
---
The matchmaking is fine, that Pam just spent a lot of money. 
---
‚Äúradoms‚Äù
---
I failed a jump in the video, but 2 fails in a row will  most certainly F you up
---
Dynamike let's you do that?
---
I feel like the goal is too open 
---
This idea was brought up million times but it's good to repeat it until SC makes it real.
---
Level 1s going up against a level 10 is not just fine
---
Lmao yes
---
You must get him to level 10 for his star power first
---
Or bounty 
---
Blackbeard 2.0
---
smells like broke in here
---
Maintain your distance when attack. Avoid bull and El primob if you can. If have to face them try to maintain distance with the wall, if they get any closer, your are dead. 
---
token doubler will double it tho? meaning it should be even...
---
I have all and didn't pay
