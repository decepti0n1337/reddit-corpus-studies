i love MHA but now that I've watched jojo I'm really intrigued what would happen if jotaro faced All Might. Great drawing btw kinda got sidetracked lol.

And you reposted the chocolate losing animashen

BIBI (DUH DUH DUH DUH DUH DUH DUH DUH) ROLL THE WHEEL
---
You actually can‚Äôt only in friendly games
---
Here's the thing giving a brawler an op star power doesn't make the brawler good so that's why I think nerfing Piper's damage just because she has a very powerful star power isn't right idea or in Reverse for Nita or Leon especially true for Leon due to the fact he has three or four seconds of invisibility so when you first unlock the brawler they're basically useless
---
germans gonna play the Blitzkrieg starpower ;)
---
oj did it in one of his videos I think
---
weebi
---
Chet because I miss ricachet
---
It's fantastic
---
It just screams furry and the animation isn't my cup of tea. That's why I'm rocking with default.
---
It says 3 to 0
---
It's fantastic hopefully if they add it their is no hay listen XD
---
Looks legendary
---
It's wonderful
---
Up to a great start
---
instead if special sunday, how about sunday special?
---
Hmm, I‚Äôm pretty sure though. I can easily do it on friendly games, but never works on normal matches
---
Man it's fantastic
---
You just need to sit down and accept your defeat
---
That is WAY too powerful

So these are the type of people that this subreddit hates for being a 1 trick... ***interesting.*** But congrats on the rank 25!

This is really amazing but has 2 problems.

2. The Rarity should be Epic because all the Mythics are somewhat magical/mystical (I think you got my point because I am not good at explaining, sorry)

That wasn't very cash money of you

You welcome

Congrats on the victory, Nova! You did very well.

Cute
---
Ricochet shall be known as the Legend from the past
---
Rico is the legend of the present
---
It‚Äôs because you were playing mortis without the hat
---
i have 14.9k but still missing three legendaries
---
Nah tons of Hispanics play this game. Half the people I go against are named Jose
---
We have different music every season though
---
Hell yeah I did. Not funny no one laughed just stop
---
Probably he never watches football I guess.....
---
I can‚Äôt speak spanish but can interpret most of this. What‚Äôs a kmanu?
---
I'm Piper not nita
---
That‚Äôs true.
---
Nita doesn‚Äôt have overpowered star powers, though. She has two fairly good ones, and doesn‚Äôt belong in that group.
---
Brawlers that are initially bad but are made at least decent by star powers are Mortis, Leon, and Piper. It really isn‚Äôt right that base Leon got any nerfs past the one that made his super take ten hits, nor is it right that Piper‚Äôs base damage is 6% lower because Ambush is overpowered. Mortis, of course, is hardly useable without Coiled Snake. All of those require a rework so their base stats are better but star powers less OP - what comes to mind quickly is
---
- Leon‚Äôs invisibility restored to 7 seconds and star powers nerfed to 21%/800
---
- Piper‚Äôs base nerfs reverted and Ambush to 650
---
- Mortis‚Äô reload from 2.4 to 1.6, Coiled Snake from 3.5 seconds for a 75% boost to 2 seconds for a 50% boost (easier to charge but significantly shorter), Creepy Harvest back to 1400
---
But then looking at Nita again, she isn‚Äôt bad without a star power. Playing in my alt account, Nita doesn‚Äôt feel bad suddenly when she lacks a star power. I can‚Äôt say the opposite for certain of the others because I don‚Äôt have them on my alt, but I do know that on my main, Mortis felt unusable without a star power in every single mode, Leon after the super nerf was only good in Lone Star, and my friend who doesn‚Äôt have Piper maxed complained a lot about the nerf and hasn‚Äôt played her since. Nita doesn‚Äôt fit into that.
---
Looked at your map and it was pretty cool but a suggestion is to ss you map cause most people aren‚Äôt inclined to click it btw
---
Good for you!
---
*Im crying on the inside*
---
Change bull to piper
---
I do agree with this
---
As someone said here, maybe it could come as a new scenario for Brawl Ball? With an ice terrain like the Christmas Upgrade and changing the Ball to an Hockey Disk. And have one or more Hockey based skins to come together
---
What?
---
How?
---
"Xolt" 
---
It isn't funny man,just stop
---
Ey ey, chill buddy, i even didn't know about your post...
---
I would buy it 
---
When discount
---
how viable is he? right now i‚Äôm using poco with d‚Äôcapo star power
---
The day will come when you get multiple brawlers in one box
---
I went 7 months without a brawler, then I got Leon and Tara in 1
---
Hell yeah, my man
---
The ending is serious unexpected

Heal on sand(Sandy's starpower)

I miss when Carl wasn't nerfed. If you had a good team, you could beat every single level easily
---
Damn I want Leon so bad the only ‚Äúrare‚Äù brawler I have is tara
---
I'm sorry what now you got every brawler but emz and you're at 7 k why does the game do this to me
---
Soul knights?
---
I'm the best player
---
Well obviously none of the other brawlers are legendary.
---
This shit is lol
---
But you can't play Boss Fight in friendly matches tho...
---
That's great

Your art is good like it always is (:

Can we get a dev opinion on here because I want to see why they think.

All of the above!

Nobody‚Äôs going to talk about Bibi not having any skins?

Ok

It's ok if its is accidental but that guy took the powercubes like he is playing intentionally.

Voted for COD. Sorry. üò≠ They have #1 and will most likely keep it. I'd say undoubtedly.

Doesn't it also have a custom voice because of the yawn?
---
Heal by standing in a sand storm
---
I bet he would have missed even if he aimed at the goal
---
Repost
---
Edit: oh you credited, sorry
---
In all realness though.. I don't see how this would stop queuing with randoms or noobies. Whether someone can or can't or takes 5 seconds to 5 minutes to figure out a puzzle piece, they still get through and queue eventually. 
---
I could see this pushing bots out.. but not improving matchmaking.
---

Bruh how is it possible to get clickbaited by the first one? It doesn't have a "WTF" in the thumbnail
---
It‚Äôs not, though. It can deal insane damage, but very rarely does if your opponents know how to deal with it. You‚Äôll usually only get one or two Hyper Bear connections per match and they‚Äôll usuallt only add about 10-20% to a push. Getting insane value requires the opponents to be bad.

Or just using it like global barley super
---

---
Well the level difference was actually pretty fair
---
picture is blurry
---
How is it not original, when it happened?
---
It‚Äôs actually okay and usually what happens, because it‚Äôs based on trophy ranges and not power levels of brawlers.
---
Why you don't save boxes
---
That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs sooooo amazing
---
I got crow and Leon before 10k trophies, also before sandy release
---
Now my Leon is lvl 10
---
The water and walls essentially trap bull, making brawlers like Tick somewhat relevant for big game. 
---
Might be able to get a good score with Piper though.
---
Sometimes you get placed with a 0 trophy brawler even if the other person wasnt in a party with him. I was pushing 700 and got placed with a 0 trophy shelly. I watched to see who pressed exit and the other 700 trophy guy pressed it but it didnt apply to the 0 trophy. Matchmaking is stupid.

---
A way to tell if your teammates are bot or not. Sometimes it‚Äôs difficult to figure out if your teammate is back after a signal issue or has been replaced by a bot. Would be super helpful in devising a strategy.
---
A great idea would be to have a story/campagne mode which would be offline and have no interaction with the online mode so you would have no problems like not having something from your account like coins and brawlers or not having a frind in the friends list,making the game more fun and having an option to play when you don't have internet.Your idea is still cool tho
---

Good News !! they responded üòÉand im back in the account !!

Nah, that‚Äôs just a custom sound effect, like werewolf Leon‚Äôs howl when he uses his super

---
I was ready to get Downvoted because people loved Leon when he was op and they want that same op Leon back and people who play Piper think they're a gaming powerhouse when they hit 2 shots at long range so they think I'm "insulting their great skill"

I don‚Äôt like these either, so I don‚Äôt watch them. I‚Äôm not sure why you‚Äôre complaining.

You should only get star tokens and a few boxes at day, good luck.x

Push ALL of your brawlers. I got 17.666 trophies without legendary and playing 80% with randoms. Push every brawler to 600. Push a few to 650. Push your favourite brawlers to 700 or 750.

Edit: what is your legy chance? Mine is 0.183% but it will be increased today

Slick Boots is definitely the one you want to use when playing Colt. The additionnal speed allows you to almost always avoid the rockets, dodge the lasers very easily and escape faster when you are low HP

It do be like that sometimes

Use to upgrade a brawler. Never waste coin buying SP unless you have all brawler at lvl 9

It depends on map and trophies you playin

That's true, but this post is talking about those random Barleys who immediately just rush the opponents' save

The Second Filter Total Trophies: Makes anyone who plays Primo For 8 hours straight and gets to rank 25 while he has 1000 trophies go away
---
The Third Filter Power Points: Brings You People Who Get the same or closest amount of power points that you get every season
---
I know this is a repost I'm just gonna post thi one more time and then I'll leave this idea alone

Really? Thanks! That means a lot for me-

Is it really better than Gedi-kor's skins tho

Supercell buff el primos range from 2 to 3
---
wat
---
It's not bad, but when three randoms who don't have any experience working together happen to have triple tanks, the chances you're going to win aren't high. The reason those teams pulled it off is because they can talk to each other.
---
Damn! thats long.. did you manage to play after the 7 days ?
---
How you did it
---
I have an even more worse problem. 1 min left in the season and I go into brawl ball with my 743 Tara, hoping to win and getting shreko mode. I got in the game and won, but my Tara got reseted to 600 ( you get reseted to 600 if you're brawler was 700-749). After that match, it showed Tara's rank up to 25 and +400 star points. But when I went back into the lobby it didn't give me my 400 star points and my Tara was still at rank 24 :(

I don't think so.

Triple tanks are somewhat weird. They can counter control comps but they can also get countered by control comps. It's really interesting and refreshing to see triple tanks in matches

These star points are left overs from the season before. I got 6k the season before last.

A Coach Cory quality content!!!!
---
Damn, I nearly forgot abt the old Brawl Stars
---
The game has improved so much since then
---
Your probably right. I feel like theres a re-model coming this month
---
My chance is 0.15% and I got a legendary like after 8 months of playing

Awesome art and I give you bonus points for *thiccness*
---
Cause this people wanna play with the legendary, but when they start need so much gold for only level up 1 brawler they will change their mind. All my friend list in my 3 accounts prefer gold than a little chance of win a legendary in a star point mega box.
---
Lol she looks like Mei
---
The tick was ok for a minute but that MORTIS
---
wow, such noob
---
bro he doesnt have the friends
---
It‚Äôs not a preferred strategy, just stating that it‚Äôs the one seen in the post.
---
Why its not just assasin ü§î
---
Not a big fan of Pam...She shoots like my ak47 spray in csgo
---
Why would anyone use Mortis in this game mode?
---
SAME!!! I love Bibi
---
First, did you spend money on the game? You have Mortis power 10 that early and 2 legendaries. Still lucky.
---
If you didnt spend money then you are extremely lucky.
---
Your chance to unlocky ONE legendary that early is 0.11%. After you pull it from the box your chance drops to like 0.05%. But you pulled another one from that although your chance just got decreased. And since you also have Mortis and a few Epic your chances were even lower.
---
I feel like you get every brawler at one point on the trophy road, except legendaries. If you are unlucky you can wait 1 year to get your first one.
---
big cirsmas bibi?
---
He was 14k trophies,I think he made it for trolling
---
Yeah I know, but at this point I have been getting only coins in boxes for several months now, it wouldn't be a big loss. I regularly get enough coins to level up another brawler from lvl 7 to lvl 9 every week, and there are several I'd really like to use for Power Play, that's the main issue
---
Not sure... I accidentally used Primo bc I'm stupid but we still won
---
See you, thot
---
They were probably in a team together with the mortis
---
I was lagging too hard to do anything else
---
Side story 2.0
---
How about , no.
---
Can‚Äôt quite decipher what the image is supposed to be, please tell me.
---
he's probably going to use it anyway
---
We already saw the tick in human version in the brawl stars trailer
---
This is really good, keep up the good work
---
yes i was playing 295 trophy brock shelly own goaled accidently
---
Not funny didnt laugh
---
it ain‚Äôt true, got 6k last season pushing 3/4 hours per day
---
Tap on your username and select change user flair
---
Yeah pam is def not a heavyweight. She has way to low health and has great range with healing ability. All heavyweights have usually high health and high dps but lack range
---
r/fbiopenup
---
The reason I keep playing is because when I get into higher clans they do mini tournaments and u make money so it‚Äôs kinda like a side job if u win.
---
And yet you use the Nita flare
---
Well I'll try to push during xmas holidays
---
Nah, your english is fine
---
well, if you just stop pushing one brawler, he‚Äôll eventually go back to 525. 
---
i just stopped playing with shelly, and she is now at 550 trophies at power 10, but my tick is like 900 at power 6
---
Pls make more it looks soo cool
---
NO ITS NOVEMBER
---
Longform aka 1 year? I have never bought any boxes other then the star points boxes. Long term don‚Äôt work I stopped buying tickets in august and have 200 gems so I‚Äôm gonna buy a legendary it‚Äôs what keeps me playing for now.
---
*warning adorable*
---
Lmao so true, Nita is my favorite brawler, but Bibi is easily 2nd, Bibi is also my favorite to use, idk why i love Nita so much

Did you know what's hapened to ioe?
---
The season ago the previous season (do you understand it?) I buyed Shiba Nita. I liked this skin so much that I played with her so much. When I had noticed, she was rank 24 (power 7) and I said: "Let's put it rank 25!". But the season end and bye bye trophies! I'm thinking put Shelly (power 10) rank 25! Thank you for read all of this! üòä
---
Wtf bro üòÇüòÇ
---
He lost
---
You just lost nnn
---
He actually Did it
---
Wait no brawl stars is nothing without ryan üò≤üò°
---
I'm not saying if you play weel or not! I'm saying that the people with low trophies have so so much luck! Sorry
---
1. She works very well in the maps where there are less bushes. (Like Double Trouble)
---
2. As everyone said, do not auto aim. Always check bushes if there are any enemies around.
---
3. (If she has super), she has an advantage aganist Crow, Darryl, Bull and El Primo (with their supers). If these brawlers use their super (and if you have super), she has a chance to escape so that's a plus.
---
4. She is one of the best brawlers in Bounty so if you are tired of playing Showdown, you can use her in Bounty.
---
5. Not as good as Bounty, but she works well in Gem Grab (especially Minecart Madness and maybe Cross Cut since it is nearly the same as Shooting Star in Bounty).
---
6. But she is better at Lone Star and also Takedown (unless you focus on other players but the robot).
---
7. Not being used by the other players in Heist, but her best map is Safe Zone.
---
8. If you want to use her in Brawl Ball, try to charge your super as quick as possible and you can open the enemy team's goalie with her super.
---
9. Bad at Siege. Maybe she is slightly good at Factory Rush but I do not recommend playing Siege with her.
---
10. RUBBISH at Ticketed Events.
---
Extra : If you have enough Star Points, get that Pink Piper. :)
---
*boss has vanished off the surface of the earth*

Does anyone realize that this is inaccurate. 6 foot is only ONE inch more than 5‚Äô11‚Äù and they are definitely not only one inch apart haha
---
*mortis want to know you're location*
---
It‚Äôs a one inch difference lol
---
Ahhh the infamous skin for El Primo
---
Furry Primo:I always use it
---
What's the difference??
---
Well the word:"noob"means that someone sucks at the game,while newbie means that someone is new to the game
---
So, you have a lot of time to do this ( I mean Shelly rank 25)!

Okay i guess lolüòÇSya later

Sneak 100

Oh she quite thicc
---
The cut is completely unecessary. You can just make the shelly already be in there before you start recording. Unless this was done in an actual game. If so then props

Why
---
when I got Pam (2k trophies) I maxed her out in 2 weeks (no spending money) so I can play max level robo rumble and almost immediately I pushed her to 300 trophies (the old trophy system) now I'm 14k trophies I have 7 level 10 and I already need only gold to max out the other brawlers
---
6551
---
Its geneasour!
---
Yup, happens to me several times everyday, especially on Power Play which makes it even more annoying. I don't know if the player base is getting more immature by the day but it's getting harder and harder to play a normal match with randoms.
---
Spike with eyes.
---
On god
---
Brock is OP!
---
You've got a talemt if that's real
---
What part?
---
Horay!
---
I still dont have legendarys
---
Yeeesss
---
r/lostredditors
---
I'm not sure what you are trying to say here. Other than you agree it's a good idea to get one brawler maxed out first. Because it seems to have worked out for you.
---
Not that good
---
how much nitas bear bruce costs
---
Some sudanese tribes have 6"4' average Male height. Along with many other African areas with an average male height of over 6 foot.

Cool skills

Qu√© suerte macho, ni en mi cuenta con 16k copas me sale
---
I'm trying to say that he's doing it too late for my taste at this point he had to have at least 4 lvl10 and btw I hate Bibi
---
Yo you forgot primo with 10 gems
---
even if the 0 one teamed up with the one at 500 theres still a big number gap there, adding the 300 one up just males thos ss cursed
---
Create una cuenta :)
---
stop playing games in class
---
well that happens when you force vertical mode
---
Pero si le quiero en mi main, no en otra
---
Who would ignore a Barley with extra noxious?
---
Man, Supercell are trying to remove everythong randomised in the game(Bo's mines, Tick's attack).
---
But what if the 1st year anniversary is the next update
---
What was your time though
---
wish i could get star powers but i just wait smh
---
I feel like your just making a lot of assumptions with barely any data. Why should he have that many? Because his trophies are higher? Trophies don't have any impact on account progress. You could start a new account today and grind up to that high in a month. But all your brawlers will be lower level.   
---
Unless you like dug through his post history or something. I didn't bother with that.
---
Next lukie bear?
---
Stop spamming.

Rico is also a robot

maybe if it was symetrical on the diagonal it would look good
---
You have a very talented son

Congratulations!

\*Criying in corner with no Star Power at 15k\*
---
Good bot
---
I don't think that would be a good idea, because it takes away the purpose of having the middle bit.
---
I made this bounty map because there aren‚Äôt any bounty maps that favor throwers currently. https://crux.page.link/2m6Tg
---
Yes i agree, give them private servers
---
I know three gems is alot
---
Jesus
---
That would be good for prenerf carl I am still sad about it but other than that I like it, could have many different brawlers compared to most heist maps
---
View of the valley
---
Thank you, I also really miss the old Carl.
---
I don‚Äôt know if this is right, but I‚Äôm too lazy to check, soo...
---
True, however we have seen asymmetrical maps in the past like snake prairie, for example.
---
I‚Äôd say make the middle have no grass so it‚Äôs not super easy to get across, that‚Äôs all I have to say
---
Wth am I looking at
---
That would be satisfying dough
---
#H U N G R Y!
---
I have to make that part open so the bolts can spawn. Is there any other way I can fix this?
---
What do you mean? I wouldn't say anything bad if they were your freinds in game i just want to know
---
Lord, please forgive me for what I‚Äôm ‚Äôbout to do
---
can we just appreciate the amount of gold im poor i only get 11 only
---
I'm already well above that amount.
---
I typed comands like this just to prove that these comands dont work
---
Extend that area to be from side to side. So you can‚Äôt super easily go into the enemies side.
---
Same here 0.2113
---
Hello
---
Thanks, I‚Äôll improve that.
---
tip of advice: move your watermark back to the middle of the map, because someone can just crop the top and bottom parts out and claim it as their own
---
Also tick santa skin
---
They Just have to get less views so they cant clickbait more
---
Seems desperate
---
if only I could get one of the Sakura spikes
---
So I had Shelly level 9 or power 9 and I asked my friend if I should open a Big Brawl Box and he said yes, so I did, and I got some bull points and SHELLY‚ÄôS SHELL SHOCK THEN SHELLY‚ÄôS BAND-AID. Like literally as soon as I get her to 9 she gets BOTH her Star Powers in the same box. How rare is that?
---
your son has potential
---
I feel like if it had legs and would try to avoid enemy players while attacking them it could be really interesting
---
LOL
---
That is the cringiest sentence I've heard in a long time.
---
Shellys in boss fight be like:
---
This isn't a brawl talk. It was confirmed in a different post
---
You‚Äôre welcome
---
Hey..
---
Congrats I'm at 9000 but have like 8 star powers fore Jessie penny Poco and Nita know I feel bad
---
Swears are not welcome. I will not upvote.
---
Ok but 15 remodels?
---
Probably because shelly is overrated in boss fight :S
---
Idk how I should feel about that furry primo

If you toss it at max range it‚Äôs 15% faster
---
*Darryl heavy breathing*
---
walter
---
And what about your friend with no legendaries a d mythics?
---
Looks cool at first glance, but it suffers from asymmetry and even if you fixed that it has the Dynajump problem which is tougher to tackle without destroying the idea of the map. Cool concept, not realistic to implement it well.
---
I thought about that, but he won‚Äôt roll forever, The game make him phase trough wall when that happens
---
It‚Äôs either el-primo or Leon.
---
Not if you put it on the line. Or have they patched that? Just got back into the game so idk.
