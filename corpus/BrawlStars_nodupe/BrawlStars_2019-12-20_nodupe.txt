I bought pink piper and calavera piper. Ofc i wish she had effects but beggars can't be choosers. I'm gonna hold off and get lil helper penny because I'm afraid this might be the last year she's available.

Its super cool additon. Makes this mode evn more unique against BB
---
Its a bit dizzy hut not too much

Will this cost gems?

Jessie &amp; bulls make sense, so do the others, but I like theres the most

Chances are that these pirate skins will come back next brawlidays, but I'm scared that the classic christmas skins wont :/

Ohhh, Mortis! YOU HAVE DONE IT AGAIN

I have a feeling that the ones from last year won't come back next year, which is why they're discounted even more. I think next year a new set will come out and the pirate ones will be discounted. Keep in mind, they used to have discounts allllll the time in the shop, then the summer/august (i can't remember which) came and all discounts basically vanished. Now they show up maybe every other week.

Okay

This perfectly explains how I feel thank you. It is a fun new unique game mode, but it is seriously just pushing back and forth. No real strategy other than wipe the enemy team in their spawn. Also, if I die by a Daryl that just spawned in as soon as I grab the gift, I‚Äôm going to lose my mind.

Already in the game. It's in the settings &gt; locked movement control
---
This is the last time I‚Äôll try to explain this to you because I have other things to do. Every time Poco attacks (regardless of hitting enemies and/or getting his super) he has these minor effects with his skins. With Serenade Poco, you can see breaking hearts around Poco‚Äôs head (which is what OP what talking about), and with pirate Poco,  broom bristles spread everywhere when he attacks. It‚Äôs a shooting animation, and a lot of skins have shooting animations, like Li‚Äôl helper pennies snowflakes, Corsair Colt‚Äôs flames and captain Carl‚Äôs fish; these effects are separate from the attack itself and are very minor. You are looking for them in the wrong place. Focus on Poco NOT his musical notes.
---
I mean it is essentially capture the flag, although I wouldn‚Äôt mind supercell getting creative and using something else.

What if they get rid of the Christmas decorations but keep it pirate themed and call it "Treasure Trembler" and you throw treasure chests instead of presents
---
Yessir
---
While it is right that the team below has quite the team buffs (Max, 8-Bit &amp; Sandy), you can consider the upper team has many healing elements, and has 2 good throwers

I get Leon and Crow in the same opening, I saved 140 boxes to open when Emz was release, in that moment I was 12K trophies
---
i think the ship tilting is a cool idea but visually gives me a headache
---
the map tilt does effect field of view, it‚Äôs a small detail but something to take into consideration
---
Ok buddy https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/ed2r6q/10_back_to_back_dubs_with_bibi/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf there‚Äôs more but it‚Äôs too far back
---
There is humor flair
---
To each their own I guess. I honestly didn‚Äôt notice at first despite  having played this game since iOS release and having over 16k trophies but hey, I could just be blind. Just said my observation upon my first impression of the skin.
---
Despite our apparent differences in opinion regarding Pirate Poco, I would agree that Santamike is the best Xmas skin. I just overall feel that the Poco skin is lacklustre in comparison to the other available limited skins, especially when there‚Äôs Serenade Poco who has a better outfit and special effects in my opinion.
---
The skin was also for people who signed up and got the app the week before release. Getting it a week before release is a preorder
---
Really dude? Are you joking!?!? I'm so tilted
---
Wait do you people have Crow
---
The legendary are not everything, I peefiero climb Nita, Emz or Poco that to Leon or Crow
---
I dont care
---
Just a simple blacklist would suffice, people can troll, I just don't want to be queued back on the same team ever again.
---
The tilting makes the gameplay so unique and makes the mode stand out, also that's why I think if they do keep it as a mode they should have it still be pirate themed
---
Ok
---
I didn‚Äôt do that and i got the skin :/

Nice. You seem to be a skilled Bibi. Id had similar results with nita.

I feel like white crow should cost 30 gems

Maybe i did and i just don‚Äôt remember
---
SP for unskilled players lol
---
Like his super kinda makes him have extra life with an infinite amount, his attack is not as long but still thicc, his 7 tiles invisibility seems a bit op, overall ur invisibility and ability to dish high dps is pretty insane. Correct me if I'm wrong via dms pls
---
i did the exact same thing in brawl ball
---
are u serious a total un noticeable amount.....like so unnoticeable that it is just something for people to complain about and try and look smart.
---
Can someone explain what's that?
---
This has been mentioned many times before. There are four of all brawler rarities, other than mythic (trophy road doesn't count). Now there are four of everything!

Well there can be multiple maps. Some maps with tilting, some without.
---
This is phenomenal.
---
Please no more tilt it‚Äôs so annoying
---
Also ez wins with leon with the speed boost star power and some good brawlers on defense. Star power with the tilt makes you so ridiculously fast.

Yes

I hate the drastic and sudden changes in speed when moving

what‚Äôs the difference!

They fixed it, update your game

Your a pro at 15k trophies telling 9k players to add you. Yeah right. And bragging on Crow and Leon, probably 2 of the least used brawlers by pros. üòÇ
---
Two super buttons = Two supers, this is gamebreaking
---
The bug isnt fixed yet. I played brawl ball 5 minutes ago. I spawned on the opposite side

How do you edit the meme

Yeah after Christmas they could just put treasure chests, give it a new name, take out the Christmas stuff on the sides and bam that‚Äôs a new game mode

Seriously, getting mythics is harder than legendaries. Still haven't got Tara

Supercell does not have to pay for you own mistakes

Oops nevermind

I can relate to that.

I reworked the second star power since I felt it was too similar to the first one, here it is.
---
Second star power: Bits and Pieces
---
When Rorrin has his super ready, he can add 2 more puffs of smoke and 4 more fragments to his main attack. But he has to sacrifice 75% of his super to do so, and the damage for the smoke and fragments is reduced by 20%.
---
Reduced smoke damage: 140
---
Reduced fragment damage: 415
---
I also reworked his main attack damage to compensate for this change.
---
New regular smoke damage: 280
---
New regular fragment damage: 530
---
That‚Äôs all I played today, and I played a lot
---
You too! And yes I agree, it does feel like Rico is getting a remodel because everyone is going to be using this skin
---
I wanted to say what the skin was, but you are being such a nice person for not spoiling and giving th eright info to everyone, I will not reveal it. Nonetheless, the skin is still amazing.
---
Piper and bea

r/titlegore but not really title

Wait what's the skin? Could you dm me too? And how do I get it?

Unfortunately, my brawlers trophy and power were too low at the time, so I couldn't use the exploit.

One of my ingame friends change dhis name to You Bots, I. I was confused why he chose such a weird name, then I got it. If he scored, it would be You bots, I scored. If he took the gift, it would be You bots, I took the gift.

Maybe a free skin like Hat Mortis?

Brawl craft would be better

Hope they release new boss like octopus additional to the robots

But Loaded Rico is the most badass skin

No Hot maze, I don't need any more teaming throwers.

but it the worst way for them to make profit

They could also start rotating between brawl ball and Present Plunder since the modes are pretty similair.

It‚Äôs to prevent language barriers and toxicity. What if you get teammates who don‚Äôt speak your language? The Brawlstars community can be very toxic and just rude, especially in game. Adding chat will make it far worse. If you REALLY want to create strategies, play with a proper team, not randoms.
---
Ya ik
---
I KNOW U CANT EVEN PLAY
---
Not with Poco heals, or Pam.
---
You could literally just put Frank stun and end it there. Even if slows stacked, you‚Äôd never come to a complete stop, even as 8bit

Nice piplup and mudkip.

I strongly disagree with you. I say they are both excellent modes, certainly much better than takedown or lonestar.
---
What? Face? Hand? Or Bruce‚Äôs butt?
---
Reminds me of Nintendo DS times.

You should be able to donate coins

Agreed! Spike and gene are two of the best Brawlers in the meta rn, but Leon has it's own unique charm a charm that can't be neglected or denied.
---
At 0:41 barley is the one that stays on the chair and rico is the other
---
That's easy
---
And you managed to hit the nail on the head on why everyone hates the new dynamic
---
Most of the people who play Brawl don‚Äôt know shit about strategy and instead choose an overly aggressive gung ho playstyle which usually ends in their death and costs them the loss

You are all bastarsds

Just go back in it aint a ban ban

Around 12 to 13k

Shut up.

not for 900-950

I meant the push from 600-800

An 8bit was on the enemy team trying to climb the ship and he was walking like 0.1 tiles per second 
---
I felt bad for him
---
New skins for brock confirmed
---
It's only 99 though.

On Reddit you need to put a space between lines, meaning you hit enter twice. If you only hit enter once Reddit ignores it for some reason, unless both the line you‚Äôre starting and the line before starts with a hyphen.
---
Red bull gives you wings lol
---
Dude stop it i‚Äôve seen this before asshole no one cares
---
Yes,continue please,I want to see Leon‚Äôs
---
You can just play present plunder
---
I think her super is great... you can use it for kiting, to get away from people, to stop people from getting away, ... it's a new super you have to get used to, but I really enjoy it
---
Oh
---
17 1 6 that‚Äôs normal for me
---
I like siege more than brawl ball so i dont want to remove it
---
Wait this is between max and leon gang not tara gang
---
its a bit faster then regular speed i think
---
They said average player trophies are around 5.5k IIRC.

Same with darryl

No matter the price im going to buy this

Sorry, he has always shot 8 shells at least since the global update.

Atleast you have a legendaryüòîüòî
---
Oh. Im dumb.
---
then say in the comments you didnt make it
---
They told you what you did in the ban message dumbass
---
No thanks for a non-Mortis friendly map.
---
Tell me what to say...
---
I have 2... But I am lvl 143 with a maximum of 18k5 tr
---
Whaaaaat!? How this is posibble
---
But Thats Cool
---
you can literally just say "i found this on youtube i didnt make it". is it really that hard to think up a sentence?
---
That's a great point you mentioned, thank you, I will fix it
---
Probably not enough grass
---
I did not find this in yt
---
Im just waitin for the greatest day ever
---
I do not want it to be permanent, because it's value is defeated, but if that means the GS maps will be back, then yes. That way, they can remove the cancerous showdown maps and bring back Barren Badlands, Feast or Famine, Erratic Blocks, Deserted Vertex, and most importantly: Double Trouble.
---
for me it reaches 92% then stops
---
Wait I thought that was just photoshop
---
I want Present Plunder to become Capture The Flag, when the Brawlidays is over, and be in one slot with Brawl Ball.
---
I 100% agree cuz these maps are awesome
---
It‚Äôs a beautiful mess
---
It's really fun idk what you're talking about
---
Come again?
---
Yes sir
---
Honestly with these kinda things its RNG. I saw atleast 9 other posts with the exact title and picture
---
I wanted to upvote this but it was on 69
---
I saved 200, nothing. :/
---
Nice mods
---
Same it was cool ... i saw mortis mortuary back and this sae theme (srry 4 my bad english)
---
The tilting mechanism was fun in the beginning, not anymore tho
---
I can confirm. I originally was not a fan of Piper, but she really grows on you once you master her. Shes best at long range as her bullets do the most damage at max range. Her reloading star power is a game winning star power on those maps where you always see Pipers.
---
I got this as well you got 2 of every token
---
You guys r getting stuff out of boxes?
---
I love that brawl ball is permanent but I understand
---
I opened 204 exactly, nothing.
---
Correct

All the brawl stars brawlers are trainers in clash royale

P.S im talking about the youtuber

ikr the game mode is slowly getting popular since the update ~and the petitions to make it permanent are increasing daily~

Ok you don't have to believe it

Not really, you should(IDEALLY) only need to see the top edge of the screen, and devices that aren‚Äôt 16:9(like new phones and iPads) have black bars on the sides that provide extra space for you to put your fingers

Im pretty sure they‚Äôre based in Finland. I think it‚Äôs summer now there.

It also happened to me
---
nice :D
---
This is what i thought it was. I get the bug so often I started thinking it was a winning streak combo breaker feature.
---
i mean it's not luck based like lone star or takedown atleast it takes some skill to play it
---
It probably didnt "really" give you a heart attack
---
But dude, you got 2k upvotes with a Screenshot too :/
---
Wait. Gene is actually Persian I just do a little search
---
It definitely needs a damage buff in my opinion
---
No I just wanted to make sure that everybody knew, I posted on lot of subreddits
---
Yep, you can see it through the holes in maps with Darryl‚Äôs ship
---
ah yes, someone sucker punches me in the face for a photo
---
lmao a Russian blet player, it was 100% obvious he was gonna do something shitty like that
---
Its because they arent temporary but present plunder is temporary
---
It's wierd that Gene is a Persian, Tara is an Egyptian, and Sandy is like Arabian
---
That‚Äôs the nice thing about opinions. They can‚Äôt be wrong. Otherwise it would be an fact.
---
Yeah, but it's also the bear model.
---
Imma?

Just just please leave i hate people like you

Yeah, it‚Äôs true. But I would not move anything else.

If you've seen the replies he's sent you'll know why

We can still upvote it, just to show the community how toxic people can get.
---
Do already have some legendary? Cuz your chance is pretty good
---
It‚Äôs a datamine
---
I am willing to bet that Max found some sort of stable V9. Unlike the ones in The Flash
---
Maybe because their brawlers trophies are still very low
---
Darryl's lose animation is nuff to describe the player's shame
---
But I opened game and I saw this I wasn‚Äôt in any team
---
This is proper cool man
---
Every single showdown map besides cavern churn is better than this pile of shit, and like Gavyn said there's actually a variety of map makers, just that OwenReds and Mordeus have the most, so they create the illusion of having 90% of them. And like u/OneTileGaps said, people only upvoted this map because of aesthetics, only a small portion of the brawl stars community knows how to judge maps
---
It often comes at 2am, when I'm often at school
---
Nah i misunderstood Solos and Duos, it's my fault, i accidently referred to 1000 solo showdowns
---
I wanna it too
---
I agree, but I still don‚Äôt know where the line between aesthetic and playable is. I‚Äôll leave you a map I made which I think is ‚Äúplayable‚Äù.[Erase/Replace Bounty map](https://crux.page.link/UJMZ)

---
I got creepy harvest SP
---
That's not a reason to make everyone's experience bad. Right now the controls are just awful.
---
I've had it where I used my super but it didn't activate for 2 seconds, I stopped touching the screen since the super stick was locked upwards. There was no no wifi symbol and everyone was still moving.
---
I'll try to walk in one direction but hit a wall and I start moving side to side, giving the shelly casing me henough time to close the gap and finish me off.
---
The worst thing I've had was when my character moved in the exact opposite direction of where I tapped. I was shocked at what was happening since I thought it was going to make me score in my own goal.
---
Should dual screen devices be banned since your thumbs no longer cover a good portion of the screen? How about tablets, you get a better view of what's going on?
---
So fucking dumb stupid update man

Oof, I feel bad looking at these.  I'm maxed at 20k.  And everyone else doesn't even have a legendary.  So sad.

But im drawing Max the Dank Engine not the comment

Nah fam I ain't buyin that statement. People with 2.0000% are yet to receive their first Legendary. Yiu are just casually sayin you got 2 with that less of odds. Something seems off.

Does look cool but I prefer saving for the boxes for the chance for Star Powers - that‚Äôs just me though.

I find Crow a hard character to play as he‚Äôs soft and has low damage output at range so I don‚Äôt use him that much.

Really I wasted a grand total of 13 big boxes and 134 boxes to get nothing but coins
---
I'm ready for tomorrow aswell. I got 17 big and 274 regular
---
Very nice! Try to make other brawlers
---
Wow,that is many!
---
Yeah we get it your pfp is unedited which means you make irrelevant posts
---
Same thing happened with graveyard shift..... People thought playing it too much lead to permanent add but we ended up knowing more people playing lone stars and takedown..... Idk why
---
Saying nothing...
---
Gotta catch some of them
---
#HER*
---
Not too bad for a first attempt. Firstly, the big chunk of walls are kinda useless and like Clock Fight‚Äôs water, take up space for no reason at all. Secondly, the wall at the bottom is waaay too long and the only useful structure in the bottom/top half of the map. There is also waay too much block variety in the center and is kind of bland. It could be more open to encourage more killing. There could be more stuff on the sides.
---
At least you can find power points. I have only 25 brawlers and i have them all level 9 and some of them with star powers and i'm waiting some star powers in the shop with my 4k+ gold

Well I've been saving since sandy came out. I am free to play and I'm just missing sandy but I decided to wait until new brawlers came out so I have a better chance of getting them.
---
SAME LOL
---
Thank you and I think you make good memes too! also your english is good.

If I saw 15 coins in a big box, I'd probably cry tears of joy on the spot

Whats the fun if you already know its coming
---
goonna stop You right there
---
Yes it was.
---
There isn‚Äôt another EXO with 2218 trophies, I don‚Äôt think so at least.
---
And I told them I had a crow icon and 13 brawlers, they should be able to locate my account.
---
They aren‚Äôt even trying! Without the player tag, they won‚Äôt do shit because they are so lazy.
---
They don‚Äôt want to use the extra work/time to try and find the account using username and trophy count, which is why they will only do the work if they are provided with a player tag.
---
It was adequate information, their just dissing me off because I don‚Äôt know the player tag and they don‚Äôt even care to try and find my account using the other info, even though I know they can.
---
I‚Äôll try it with another agent, and if that agent can locate my account with the same info, then the first agent is proven to be really lazy.
---
Ok, thank you :D
---
I got an actual person, just someone‚Äôs who‚Äôs really lazy.

And if they check that account they can see it was created in the same exact location as the account I‚Äôm contacting them with.

Power 3 Mortis in Brawl Ball. You must be your teammates‚Äô nightmare
---
Keep up the good work, cause it's just awesome!
---
Do you want me to give you a few tips to improve it?
---
Spatoon vibs
---
That wouldnt be the case since he put pre-order
---
Not gonna lie this map would make takedown better.
---
I like it how you don't have anything to say about the idea in the title
---
Really, I mean, he‚Äôs a robot
---
No! Brawl ball is way more fun than this!
---
Thx man :)
---
I appreciate it very very much
---
üòÄ
---
Where is Morty?
---
Why is
---
Eh 
---
I don't mind those type of players who go offline 
---
So ima just say nothing about the title
---
Thanks Sans, very cool
---
Download the optional update
---
No me too
---
Last brawler was Gene too because I got all the legendary first
---
Max should have the title of "wannabe superhero" instead of fighter
---
Canon of penny üòÇ.
---
white crow is the best
---
Then don‚Äôt explain it, fine.
---
And they was scurred
---
The silver is probably paid by the free coins reddit gave ya. Coins are inflated and soon the coin economy will be like Germany in the year 1918 to 1939
---
They are both really great achievements!
---
Hey Kedis.

My name is Gina, nice to meet you.

Maps are always a hot topic for our amazing community!
---
Brawlers from all over the world come up with amazing map ideas on a daily basis, and the best way to promote these map ideas to the rest of our community and of course to our Dev team too, is to post these ideas on Reddit, which is the platform of our official BS forum.
---
On Reddit, the Devs have better visibility and can evaluate the idea for a map but also they can see what the rest of the community thinks of the actual map.
---
So, if you want to show the world and the devs your idea, please click on this link and follow the instructions: https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/azra0z/makeamapmonday/
---
Map posts are accepted every Monday. At the end of each month, the most upvoted map from each week will become a monthly finalist going in for one last vote With the chance to win a gem prize.

---
I truly like your map since it's festive and is completely symmetrical! (I have a bit of OCD) I'm sure the other player's will love it too!
---
If you need any further assistance or clarification do not hesitate to contact me again.
---
Have a nice day ahead.
---
Stop posting brawl box openings in r/brawlstars. It‚Äôs making me depressed. Post them in r/lootstars.
---
The map needs to be symmetrical or else it wouldnt be fair to everyone
---
I have no idea if he just translated stuff to english or this is just bullsh\*t
---
Where's the voice?
---
If it makes anyone feel better. I got these exact 2 brawlers 2 weeks between one another from regular brawl boxes :)
---
It‚Äôs not that similar though
---
Wouldn't hurt
---

I posted on his video that he runs around the block or 100 metres every time he doesn't get Max. Come on exercise isn't harmful and I think Kairos needs some of that. XD
---
Amazing!
---
Nita and Leon are siblings. Confirmed by Frank
---
- No water in brawl ball
---
- Keep 3 tiles between the goal and the wall before it (and 2 bricks on each side to make it harder to score)
---
- Add a few more walls and bushes

OP are you okay?
---
We are when want better skins and gamemodes.That is supercell.
---
Isn't getting boxes a strategy
---
I say thinnochet
---
He is Australian actor, famous for role of wolverine, Xmen
---
you are literally pissed off at getting free trophies...
---
I keep boxes until the New Year. I think I will have about 70 brawl boxes.
---
Something else. Will Supercell give free skin at Christmas Eve
---
I didn‚Äôt watch those. Thanks for explaining it though :)
---
But you kill the mortis  
---
stonks
---
You think there is anything I can do better?
---
She's gonna get the bone
---
Sure. Just need the losing animation. When I finish the format I will send you the link.
---
Idk mate, it‚Äôs really good
---
-2
---
Hang on
---
Your map is good, boi
---
I opened 70 boxes and I got LEON :D !!!
---
Perhaps
---
Bea*?
---
So all you people that say no is probably because you rarely are the star player. Lol. I think it's a nkce bonus for the best player of the match.
---
Exactly
---
I wrote max, so that's it
---
Brock is OP!
---
I like that.
---
I think it is
---
Still have not found anyone &lt;18k trophies in any of the ‚Äúspacestation‚Äù clubs... you people really aren‚Äôt helping his case
---
Just keep waiting. I got bibi when she was released, and I didn‚Äôt get another brawler for four months (besides tick and 8-bit) and then I got Leon and gene in one week
---
Don't call me honey
---
You too
---
YoU fOrgOt tHe fReE leGenDarY
---
It's much more fun to play without boxes but unfortunately there always seems to be a team with upwards of 8 within 30-40 seconds of the match starting
---
I got Leon when I only had about 4K trophies...and I got him out of a small box.
---
Oh fuck I hit the selfdestruct button what now?
---
suree, but her atack is horrible and just like shelly but worse
---
I didn't even know you could get banned in this game
---
idk. still think it wasn't on purpose
---
Yup, I agree, it‚Äôs just randomly sorted :/
---
I'd rather have fun than get trophies. Isn't that what playing games is about?
---
tRaPpED iN A cUMSocK
---
Lonestar is a useless thing too :v
---
It‚Äòs just luck. And mythics/Legendaries are quite rare. Takes 400 chests on average to get a mythic. And legendaries might be even rarer.
---
(400 boxes are over 2 month of F2P progression)
---
Savage
---
Why?
---
She's tryin to fart ¬∞_¬∞
---
Lies
---
Brush I got mortis and Leon in the same day both in small boxes
---
She has a splash attack,you can kill teamers with that easily. You just don't know how to play with her. She's counter to shelly and that's a fact.
---
I  littered doing the same thing and will also hav like 70 boxes üòÜ
---
its been AGES since i got a brawler and its prolly more than 2 months
---
r/holup
---
Awesome
---
Takedown require some skills. The most usefull skill to have is precisely to learn to deal with the rng. That requires a lot of practice and understanding. That's too much for many.
---
That is also a possibility xd
---
Can u reply
---
Why would you play Nita on solo showdown though.
---
I can feel #love is in tha air...
---
That‚Äôs your problem not supercells
---
"They had me in the first half, not gonna lie" also, thanks
---
On the Treasure Hunt map she was very good
---
Gained 200 trophies on that map
---
Then I tried every other mode and lost
---
Yeah, I know - but that is the thing with probability. You might get lucky and draw 2 brawlers in a few days - or get unlucky and stay for month without new one. Took me like 8 month for my first legendary.
---
You can google ‚ÄûLoot box calculator‚Äú and insert your droprates for some estimations.
---
Imagine needing to charge you super before you can even jump once.
---
Don't pay attention at me, i'm just a comment that isn't referencing Sans
---
If you think you can help pls add me
---
Same here, got sandy and a star power from the 3 mega box and got crow today with the free big box.
---
You guys aint safe either
---
Pq isso n√£o tem mais upvotes? &gt;:0 Quero upvotes pra essa arte maravilhosa na minha mesa agora! &gt;:^
---
they all look good but they need colors
---
Wait i don't get the message im non english speaker, what do you mean?
---
Congrats
---
Upvoting so people can laugh at you more
---
Me at 14.5k trophies
---
I have mini
---
I mean she have a Poco's picture on her phone when you select her in the menu so idk...
---
we have a new pirate environment being put into rotation alongside mortis' mortuary with skins being sold that are christmas themed and pirate themed with new futuristic-style brawlers. the brawlidays are a clusterfuck of themes.
---
Speaking about the center : you have 6 access points to the center and they are too small. What will be the consequence ? The player will fight each other for the  access first and won't even be able to shoot the robot. It will become a solo show down before the real takedown (shooting the robot) even starts.   
---
When the robot will be on one side, if you respawn on the other side (which happens most of the time to the players) you'll not only have to travel through the map but also to fight once again to get through these  entanglement points without alternative.   
---
To make it short, if you make it once near the robots, you'll probably win. That's not a good thing for a map.
---
[here the same comic but made better](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ)
---
How am I only thinking about the top 1%? extending the trophy road would affect everyone lmao. Its not my fault that u dont play the game like everyone else ü§£ I don't even grind the game and ive been done with it for over a year.
---
So true!
---
My favorite is Corsair Colt, then Captain Carl and then Pirate Poco
---
And I was only able to buy Pirate Poco. But okay, he's still nice
---
I mean that ghosts are most of time in movies, tv shows, are invisible, that's why I think one of his Star Powers should make him invisible.
---
I'm a non english speaker too don't worry
---
Thank you but I was wondering how to get different fonts
---
Yea I was thinking this too. They should make it so the skins can be your profile picture icon. It wouldn‚Äôt make sense to make them the brawler ‚Äúprofile‚Äù picture on the selection screen.
---
Instructions unclear, dick stuck in toaster
---
nvm im retarded
---
Or was it Arkansas
---
uh,
---
Firs of all how the heck you hack the game, it‚Äôs impossible. And second I think they are doing now every summer just like the last one, so it‚Äôs timed and paced.
---
When you press the x button instead of accept
---
well i don't have bea but i guess you need a teamcomp with rosa and emz, bibi is good too (spike can be a good choice for defence)
---
*This is rule 34 police speaking, drop the pen now.
---
Probably not
---
How do you know if you can't see them? Ghost would look like the ones from graveyard shift
---
I mean it is still his fault to claim it for his own
---
It looks really really good
---
Where is it?
---
A. Shelly hard counters bull, because she has more range and bull can‚Äôt defend her super. This is pretty normal.
---
B. Shelly sucks. She can literally only deal with tanks and nothing else. If you just learn how to keep your distance then you‚Äôll be fine. Once you start playing more you‚Äôll see that the only mode that Shelly is good in is brawl ball.
---
Aw yes, JSAB!
---
Darryl ora the best
---
I just made a new account and found some lvl 10 accounts with star shelly. How do thet get it?
---
It‚Äôs a good game if you want to hear some good songs
---
U mean taken down
---
Just use the new search feature and look for good players
---
6k definitely isn‚Äôt competitive. I‚Äôm 15k and I‚Äôm nowhere near competitive.
---
EMZ stands for Evil Magical Zombie
---
It‚Äôs just on the map Naughty Elves, as I understand it. It‚Äôs a dynamic map, like Minecart Madness, meaning the map changes throughout the match.
---
You are super gay
---
Then when is competitive. When you are #1? I think 15k is competitive enough
---
\&gt; punishing people for not using it 
---
Nobody's being punished for not using a service that's provided, *gratis,* to back up your account. But with every single mobile game, regardless of the company: if your account isn't connected to anything -- or if the service it's connected to is on an account that your device isn't currently linked to (or so forth), you're setting yourself up to have a **bad** time.
---
*CRIES IN RICO FANBOY*
---
Can‚Äôt you just get it. Supercell did this on purpose, it is not a glitch, it is happening to everyone.
---
Yea I saw the same problem but it's not game changing so it doesn't really matterü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
lol what, he's not a child he knows what he's doing. lmao this post is dumb as fuck
---
How the fuck does a skeleton pull more chicks than me
