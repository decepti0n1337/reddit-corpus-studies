These look so cool, I wonder if they will add them back into the game...
---
---
---
I wouldnt mind getting a Happy Meal if it comes with a brawler collectable.
---
Gene is boy 
---
This actually pissed me off 
---
Not really, they are programmed to focus on high concentration areas, and teamers dont usually walk side bys side and can EASILY dodge them, and it still ONLY gives 2k damage, on the other hand, if youre fighting someone, there is 50% chance it will target you, and you dont always have a chance or path to run
---
why tho
---
It was not a bug...
---
Why not report the crow then too? 
---

---
Side note: can crow poison the safe?
---
People really don‚Äôt understand how to use Leon huh? They use the super to just run right at you which is obvious and attack from 2-3 tiles away instead of going right up to you. Good plays anyways, nice work!
---
Also, u can just have a shield for like 15 seconds and that would fix it
---
Your chances increase by 0.000048 for every 40 boxes you open, so in reality it should be much less than 3.8k. I don‚Äôt know enough match to account for the increase.
---
You have a 40% chance of unlocking him! Wow!
---
I only have a 25% chance. I need all the luck!
---
hs is fine and he is not weak, dont play him like he is a bull 
---
F
---
I had three big boxes and 18 small boxes but I accidentally opened a big box. I wish there was a box cancel button
---
great idea reminds me of payload from tf2 and great use for the tnt block 
---
A fellow Mortis player, nice to see another amongst the bush rangers and stealthy Leons
---
Looking forward to competing. Let‚Äôs brawl üòÅ
---
I already miss the lunar backround
---
3 mega, 27 Big and 131 regular
---
I'd take it, gene isn't too goor
---
WE HAVE A BREACH I REPEAT WE HAVE A BREACH
---
No legendary chance effects mythic and mythic effects legendary epic and super rare do same shirt and rare stays same 24/7
---
0 mega boxes 0 big boxes 1 brawl box in def unlocking him
---
Mortis gang must stick together to defeat the infinite sea of teaming dynamikes
---
Love my tokoyami üñ§
---
I agree with you, pretty sure he's the character I got most of my solo SD wins, he is insanely good when played correctly

Yeah, it could be that. The FBI joke is overly used whenever I see something about any female character in Brawl stars. I hate to see that joke over and over again whenever I‚Äôm just trying to enjoy art and read nice comments. I don‚Äôt want to post my artworks because I feel like someone is going to say the same joke. I personally got tired of the meme.
---
Thanks man, that's sweet (no homo)
---
This happens to prevent AFK players from getting rewards. However, it doesn't work too well, and if your game crashes (Which my *brand new* phone ***still*** does), then it doesn't let you gain anything. Personally, if my 2 day old phone is crashing, I think the game needs crash fixes.
---
Agreed
---
Wait so gene is a mythic? Why is his thing blue?
---
Mortis Gang!
---
bulls wet dream
---
Of course I am wdym 
---
I see so many ppl who downloaded the game early with like 100x more progress than me now I see why. progress is so fucking slow now in comprarison
---
I ruined the 666 likes
---
Agree, but IMO Poco is strong enough already. He doesn't need a buff...
---
***fly free my pretties!***
---
This is like... a good thing. Legendaries don't effect Mythical chances but Mythicals do effect Legendary chance. I actually unlocked Crow two days ago and was super happy. I FEARED getting Gene first knowing it'd fuck my legendary chances.

Cant wait to see some pr0n with them

A teaming mortis? That‚Äôs a first,
---
are people really that offended by emotes lmao they implemented a mute button for a reason tHe gAme wIlL tOxic bRo tHaTs kIndA crInGe xDD 
---
this is the first time happening, all my past games i played on 4g as well. Right now it‚Äôs unplayable for me. cause at wifi the game is way to laggy, same for 4g now.. all other apps work fine! 
---
you have a great gf
---
Are you trying to flex your trophies 
---
you guys both know nothing.
---
Sure Crow is a high skill support brawler, but with the current map rotation Crow really struggles.
---
Sure he can be good in a premade gem grab and a few maps here and there, but that's not the point.
---
 Bull can be played in almost every map and game mode, with a few exceptions. We finaly get a legendary and I can only use him in a few maps and NEVER with randoms. And there are almost always better options. 
---
So yes, crow needs a small buff,  nothing insane. Imo a small buff to his super, and a 5% hp increase would make a difference for sure!
---
I love crow but I'd much rather have spike to play him from time to time. Peace
---
There is a mute button if u get mad
---
and a bull heavy skin for boom beach?
---
This 
---
these were used in the 2nd UI for when the game was still in the beta, dont expect these to come back into the game, but I personally would love them back. 
---
I always play with sound... you can hear shoots, ‚Äúscreams‚Äù... for me, in SD. When the shoots stops, or they are teaming, or someone kill another, i can know this even if they arent in my screen... also, you can know who is the brawler that u cant see... some very good points!! Try it :)
---
But Jessie is a child, and Penny looks like she is underage. I have no problem with Shelly tho, love that ship a lot.
---
Supercell might take your idea, except "cost : 30 gems", they will rather make it 150 lol
---
It‚Äôs even funnier because gene hasn‚Äôt even come out yet, we just know we‚Äôll have trash ransoms 
---
Whats the difference between boki no hero academia and my hero academia? Manga vs anime?
---
That's too good to be a netflix adaptation
---
Just mute
---
Why....? Where‚Äôs it going?

if u drop an entire game because someone displays cartoon faces u have issues. If ur easily offended mute 
---
gang gang
---
Are people actually reading other comments or just reacting to the main comment for the sake of commenting?
---
Wikipedia says that "approximately 10% of the world population is left-handed" and since brawl stars has so many players I guess it's fair to assume apply the statistics on the game, I may be wrong tho but I don't think there is any reason that the precentage wouldn't apply to brawl stars unless left handed people intentionally avoid this game because it doesn't have controls comfortable for them
---
Lol k good this is my first meme 
---
Your post has been removed, make sure to use the body of a post to elaborate on the title.
---
Who feels me?
---
Lol i was deciding between 30 and 80 but i never would imagine 150 üòÇüòÇ
---
Imagine getting all 3 legendaries in 1 box
---
Did you read the flair?
---
Nice but it probably won't happen because there will be people that will say its racist
---
read the Flair.
---
PROUD OF YOU CACTUS BOI
---
[removed]
---
I only ever start lagging bad whenever I get in a tight situation like a Shelly or bull coming out of a bush. I try and super away and my character just sits there for like 3 seconds and by that time I‚Äôm already dead. Kinda makes me feel like they make me lose on purpose but who knows.
---
Quick breakdown of what I did and why:
---
This was a game with randoms and by quickly analyzing who my teammates were, I knew that Darryl would be a huge counter to both dynamike and penny. So my goal was to shut Darryl down so that he would be completely out of the game while my teammates outranged their Pam and spike. 
---
I am no game designer, and I agree with all you said, but he definitely needs a **small** buff. There is a reason people pick other brawlers over crow, and why he can ONLY be played in a few maps.
---
I don't see how what I said is wrong 
---
You should have played beta when you could watch an ad and get so much bonus 
---
brock and Jessie tho 
---
CACTI PEOPLE ARE PROUD OF U BOI
---
No thanks üòï
---
Lmao why is this being downvoted?
---
2 legendaries from 1 box nice. I hope I have that kind of luck
---
 Bro clutch plays not complete flexes 
---
I know how to fix it if u have samsung 
---
What does that have to do with anything? There is a mute button now 
---
Clash royale was made toxic because of emotes tell me a reason why Brawl stars wouldn't be the same?
---
So... the genie when maxed has achieved his max smoking dmg.... i get it
---
Nice dodge, but you were already at the limits of his range when you saw the super activate, which was pretty lucky IMO 
---
I have 9 regular boxes and 1 big box
---
i find it funny that the 1st 2 comments said something along the lines of "your map" or asking if its yours. Mabey next time you should give credit to the person in the title üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüò¥
---
Lol, i'm still saving for 14 brawlers yet :( now 15 
---
I don't think emotes were the main problem w the game lmao there were so many actual problems w it. Hit the mute button if u get mad at people showing cartoon faces problem solved 
---
Lmao u legit just indirectly teamed with bo. You purposely didnt attack him when he was very close.
---
this happens to everybody fam. its called relating to a meme
---
It‚Äôs my least favorite super in the entire game
---
Not gonna lie that probably be me. The game gets my blood boiling. 
---
Frankly, I agree. For this very same reason I'm not investing my power points in Darryl, knowing he's gonna get completely *clapped/* with the next update's balance changes.
---
I have everyone maxed n got Leon from a box 2 days after he came out without money 
---
this is but the first one of many that he is unloading into the ditch.
---
Alot of the stuff is more expensive in Clash tho. One emote is 250. Same with a lightning chest.
---
I don‚Äôt know how that could even happen
---
LUCKY!!
---
I‚Äôm in Team Domination
---
I wish my teammates were this good 
---
lucky my luck is so bad with star power I have opened 6 mega boxes and gotten no star powers
---
 No teaming
---
Haha i wish too :)
---
EEEEEELLLL PRIMO
---
Your health will drop very low
---
but the amount of yolk is unfair for the price.

perfect

I'm so screwed then. Been in a rush pushing to get Leon since Tara messed up my chances a month ago. I'm afraid of Gene now :(

Did you stay up the rest of the night playing him?...I would

I have aldredy mentioned before that drawing an ballon shovel is difficult and annoying so i just gave up and i ued the fortnite pickaxe

feels bad man
---
It could be a little bigger. Also, most showdown maps are primarily square so that the storm closes in on One point.

This is the best way to stop teaming ;)

have you thought about dyna crow or piper jumping into that little thing you put int the wall?

this wont be good for SC when people safe their boxes. i can imagine that in the future they also might do something so we cant safe so many boxes now 
---
Damn
---
I broke their ankles so hard that even the camera didn‚Äôt catch me :)
---
Thats how Crow works
---
No.
---
That‚Äôs a mega box

I know that it is a brawl stars mod

So your getting your first leggy in a few months?

---
Removed. Keep your post titles descriptive and provide context. Additionally do not use low effort/all caps/clickbait titles.
---
Ahh I beat you to it then lol.  Well would love to see it anyway
---
Also adding more healers means adding more throwers
---
2 brock OP 
---
I think his molt
---
Bo
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
nuf said
---
Barleys do tend to team with dynamikes but the dynamikes like to target the odd one out when only throwers remain. Since dynas greatly outnumber barleys, you‚Äôll rarely win in showdown if you team with mikes .
---
Me too I play ever day still not even an epic
---
3 big boxes and 15 brawl boxes
---
U should
---
All those formulas are so trivial
---
i just noticed he killed a dynamike
---
Ultra instinct mind you
---
Thank you!

Only beta players remember Alpha Male Mortis

I only hav 23 Boxes ;_;

whoopsies
---
Improvise. Adapt. Overcome. 
---
I'm left handed btw
---
Please god I want r34 Jessie so bad please
---
my first meme blew up
---
Just to make u feel better - i started playing at global release and have 2 legys 2 epics 0 mythic and all other types unlocked. AND im free to play :) feel better? :)
---
Then i guess chat will be removed in that mode then, no problem.
---
I‚Äôve seen a couple of people with the similar usernames
---
I liked western style brawl stars better
---
OMG! I had the same idea as the last comment that Bo adopted Nita from the wild and took care of her and all that.
---
Tooo Relatable
---
The wizard barely skins is just meant to be a generic wizard. It‚Äôs not the clash royal wizard. They‚Äôre just both mean to be stereotypical wizards so they end up looking similar.
---
Do you have his Star Power unlocked? That could be why he shoots üíï instead of üé∂ for some and not others.
---
Same
---
I have 3k trophies and leon, mortis, and tara. Feels good man feels good
---
I'm still insistent on the fact that his poison and slow and insane movement speed is enough to compensate for his damage
---
Brawl Ball: He's a support here. Being able to reduce your opponents HP and preventing healing pressures them off the ball for long periods of time, allowing your teammates to control the ball and eventually score. Well yeah he doesn't have burst damage but no ones playing 3 crows in one team you can compensate with a good team composition. 
---
Heist: I know he was good in old heist because of his range and super but I'm not so sure about the new heist where the safe has 6000 more HP than before. 
---
Gem Grab: Yes other brawlers can out damage him but his heal prevention is very scary. Again, not saying 3 crows would be good in gem grab but if you play him as a support rather than main damage his poison can work miracles to pressure the enemies. 
---
Showdown: I sorta agree with you on this
---
#Feel the power of music!
---
i think 150 is retexture + new animations and 300 is complete rework
---
r/mortisgang
---
Good job, Sherlock.

I literally saved one box i hope this will happen to me

Match making is fine, you‚Äôre playing with a 130 thiccochet
---
This is nice 
---
Nah the image is from Brazil television (except the math inserts)
---
He. Had. A. Hat.
---
Don't believe ANYONE......
---
Amazing supercell needs to add this skin Tara without hat
---
Imagine playing the game, every showdown will have at least 1 Gene or more.
---
not anymore
---
Is gene legendary as well?
---
Yes, if it's a Big Box or a Mega Box. Normal Brawl Boxes have either a Brawler or power points. But since a Big Box is equivalent to three Brawl Boxes, it can have up to three Brawlers. A Mega Box is ten Brawl Boxes, so it can have up to ten Brawlers (but that's basically impossible :P).
---
In this case, two of the "Brawl Boxes" in this Mega Box contained Brawlers.
---
Yesssssssss
---
too late :P

Idk why, but I thought he was gonna sing the campfire song song?

Great in showdown. Easy to push. Remember, before using your super go ina bush so enemies still think you‚Äôre in there and you can surprise them
---
Cool concept, but I think the hat is way to large
---
"Still friends?"
---
Removed - DO NOT SUBMIT POSTS WITH TITLES IN ALL CAPS. CAPS LOCK IS CRUISE CONTROL FOR COOL
---
Thnx
---
Give him a new voice actor but keep the current one for this skin 
---
Primo is too op, mortis or crow would probably be the best
---
The only problem with this is that everyone would team against the people closer to winning 
---
Yeah which isn‚Äôt usually much. It was just in comparison to everyone else in the match he was super high.
---
its been 3 days and colt's dead body is still missing
---
I love these memes
---
box saving? what is that? is it edible?
---
Ha ha ha so original *sarcasm*
---
Ah, finally, a new board game that seems interesting!
---
Can anyone explain,
---
Why Crow needs a buff?
---
Which part of his kit that needs the buff?
---
Because I think he's balanced 
---
Thanks for your upvote!
---
This is crazy! I can't upvote this enough lol.
---
I set myself a rule: stop playing once I lose 1 battle. Sometimes 2... then I never cry at night again
---
As someone at 6000+ trophies, with 3 epics, 2 mythics and 0 legendaries, I am very pissed
---
As the sound wave hits Nita, she instantly starts yelling and vaporizes the others
---
Da
---
Be careful, if Gene sucks real bad, people may take this post the wrong way...
---
This is like Arms Race mode from Counter Strike : Global Offensive, but in here not only the guns/weapon/skills will change brawler will change as well. 
---
Will love this mode, but the no of players should not be many, as then it will be just chaos. Use the showdown maps with maybe max 5/6 players.
---
What phone are you using to play? Smooth! 
---
No u

No you both

Um...

I kind of don't get the joke

Too far there bud

He is guaranteed to get it. He doesn't need any luck mmte.
---
I mean he is, since he posted the idea first 
---
I got 40 tokens, im more ready

I think gene has a heal with star power
---
Is gene going to be a mythical? His background is dark blue so I thought he would be super rare

Maybe you never see them because you are offline when they happen

Ok

Darryl teaming with bo lol
---
no it's level 4
---
This is epic! Can u do a Darryl!?
---
Dude as long as you ain't looking at Jessie
---
Really nice. I hope supercell would add this
---
It isn' t complex...there is a battle with only two characters at the same level (1,2,3,...). You earn 3 trophies if you win...and you lose 3 trophies if you lose the clash! üòÅüò≤
---
Imagine screaming BAR BARIANN instead of EL PRIMOOO
---
Sure!!!
---
I heard you suck peepee for free? 
---
Since I played coc in a Spanish and latam community I was thinking of " EEEEL BARBARO"
---
Thank you üòÅ I definitely enjoy the game and Support what supercell is doing with it 
---
The most boxes Ive seen all day.
---
And music too
---
Y'all need a year of recovery after it hits the Europe with that number
---
im pretty sure i didnt
---
The brawl box is overlapped by the events and the black bars in game done event go all the way across the screen 
---
Thats what i was thinking too i might do the 20 just cause if i do get him with the other boxes if i get points for him in the mega itll be a good amount of point for maybe him or the leggies
---
Exactly 
---
Good luck everyone! I totally understand posting if you get him. Getting a new mythic brawler so many have been waiting and saving for is exciting!

I this so much fucking tratiors

Insane!

Damn, After seeing here, seems like i got lucky.

Oh I see, I also have an iPhone X but I don‚Äôt have this problem.

Maybe try deleting and redownloading? Idk if that would help but maybe it would. Just make sure that you have your supercell ID

Look! A roasted Bull

He has low resolution

"cavern churn". go to higher trophies and you will face tons of maxed bo.

I‚Äôve gotten to 1200 trophies and I‚Äôve got some new brawlers this week: Leon, Spike, Frank, and Piper. Regular brawl boxes but Frank was a big box bonus.

Regular tokens?

Ya, Supercell really needs to work on the map rotation

SC is working to fix these but had to temporarily remove Gene from the game

*when you are the only pay to win in your country*
---
Yes.
---
I opened all my boxes and did not realize that Gene was taken off the brawler list. Did i open all my boxes without having a chance for Gene???
---
of course they will, they disabled him in game temporarily as they fix the bug in his super
---
I spent hundreds of boxes, to realize that Gene had been taken down. Please refund boxes.
---
Oh man i opened 60 small box, big box and 1 mega RIP me lul slim chance but chance is chance!
---
SC is currently working to fix these but had to temporarily remove Gene from the game
---
Take it no beta testing was done with Genie. I must admit watching every one break down on here is pretty hilarious. Evil work Supercell lol
---
Yup just seen that, i was teamed up with Gene on bounty, teammate was pissed!
---
Removed because his super would crash the game
---
I didn't got him and i opened 5 mega boxes...üò¢
---
The fix to it is to play a different character first then gene and game won‚Äôt crash anymore
---
BS and Royale routinely crash, which is why I‚Äôve stopped giving them money, and won‚Äôt make any further purchases from them until they address this issue. Royale has been a complete joke since the December update.

Hey Brawlers, unfortunately we've discovered a critical bug in Gene's super. We'll need to disable Gene until we can fix this issue. Very sorry for the delay in Gene's release and we'll update you as soon as we have more information.

If you already unlocked Gene, don't worry! You will still have him once he's reenabled.

Gene‚Äôs pull is so epic it pulls you out of the game

Lol, the one person on this subreddit who isn't whining about gene being gone, but making a joke of it
---
Player: There‚Äôs a bug in Gene. 
---
SuperCell: OK, we will delete him. 
---
SC temporarily removed him in a hotfix to fix the bugs
---
This will make it seem like a brawler is better than another tho imo
---
A rollback for the people who got screwed would be the best option. 
---
So... genie disappeared from my offers mid draws, fun fun fun

I saw him in the shop, went to check the brawlers and he wasn't there - so I went back to the shop to see if he was actually available and poof- he's gone

As long as Supercell do the right thing and confirm Gene offer will return they are doing correct thing for their customers. I'll happily spend gems on Gene but they have to bring the offer back once Gene is reinstated.

Yeah same here bro. I wasted 160 boxes and nothing. I've all other brawlers! All boxes wasted :( Please supercell help us here. 
---
Wait I was playing a bounty and guess what gene was there
---
Yes i know that i don‚Äòt have to buy him and not everyone has money for him, but that‚Äòs not my point. The fact that not everyone has money for him or doesn‚Äôt want to buy him is my point. For those people, seeing people just instantly buying him is very unmotivating to get him because he loses his specialty as a ‚Äûnew‚Äú or mythic/legendary brawler.
---
First off, I never said they should not do it, just saying why put effort into this when they can make new maps, ect.
---
It doesnt matter for me cuz it will take months for me to get him
---

---
SC temporarily removed him to fix the crashing issues
---
Is it fixed?
---
I feel better for not unlocking him 
---
they must give 100 gems or something to compensate ..
---
That‚Äôs a waste of gems I got gene in 20 boxes
---
Ofc they wil bring it back lol? It gets them $$$ should be damn common sense....
---
Thanks for ur answer, I was getting a bit worried.
---
Supercell disabled him due to game breaking bug.
---
Did anyone else see Gene available and start opening boxes only to realize near the end he was no longer available?
---
Did that basically waste our boxes or was there still a chance at getting him?
---
If so this is possibly the worst thing to ever happen to the game. This new system of release sucks.  
---
I really think people should get those boxes back because there was no warning given in-game of the removal.
---
I can‚Äôt find him in the Brawlers tab. It still says 22
---
Yes, the same happened to my, please Supercell, say something, or this is just a marketing strategy? hhahahah I want answers
---
Epic. Pam and Frank are easily my favorite characters in the game. 
---
I‚Äôm hoping to god they can put our boxes back but I don‚Äôt know if they can it would be so hard for everyone
---
Maybe he was clicking play again? Without crashing I will check thx
---
Gene is here? Where? XD
---
Supercell removed him to fix a huge bug. 
---
Don‚Äôt worry you will get him back later. 
---
Dirtygemmer here
---
Gene returned to the lamp :/
---
Fits really well ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
2 Small , 1 Big , Got 2 new Brawlers - Leon &amp; Gene
---
Omg
---
gene is where? i didnt find him in any of my brawl boxes :'(
---
This is a terrible idea, no one would want to spend money if they could already play all the brawlers. When brawl stars stops making money, we all lose due to shit content.
---
Thanks alot
---
Lol that makes sense. Also i feel you man. F2P all the way!
---
Did they even play test him
---
Just disappeared? 23/22 brawlers
---
I was already opening boxes when I noticed Genie wasnt available for the bug.... I opened 125 boxes....
---
He‚Äôs so short. 
---
Looks like Supercell recalled him. He fell off my roster as well; although, I can still play as him since I had him equipped already. 
---
Hopefully he will be fixed soon.
---
If it was on my shop, wil it come back there too?
---
He does a great leon impression tho
---
you gotta be fucking kidding? i opened 200 boxes in a row and when i finished opening i relised that it‚Äôs gone
---
For real!!!
---
Same here
---
Same :D
---
I think the algorithm is just trying to connect genes against genes and that is why it is taking too long. I played like 15 games as Gene in different modes and every single time I get Gene as my opponent. I might be wrong though. 
---
Sure not, that‚Äôs your fault
---
No worries, Im even more worried I saved over like 100 boxes and didn't unlock an epic lol
---
Apologize gifts is for n00bs... Are u a n00b?
---
I‚Äôve also learned that he just crashes in GG randomly so until he is fixed he is unplayable.
---
X to doubt
---
Gene isn‚Äôt available NOW! üßû
---
Try reaching customer support through the in app setting and reach out to the devs 
---
Oh that sucks. 
---
That's lucky I had unlocked him already 
---
Yeah but if you removed the brawler does that mean we wont get a refund from our boxes
---
Woah, power level 9 with zero trophies :o
---
Shut up if you have nothing good to say
---
Come with a suggestion on how to fix or stop complaining - it cant be perfect
---
Thanks üëç
---
Missed your cake day :/
---
Nice idea
---
I opened 92 small boxes and 9 Big boxes.. a solution by SC NOW
---
Bull's right hand is getting dangerously close to penny chest 
---
Prepare the FBI 
---
&gt;uses super
---
&gt;game crashes
---
Lol
---
Dude. Did you even read the second from top tweet? If you've unlocked Gene, you'll still have him after he is reenabled. 
---
Oh damn it so I was just unlucky?
---
He‚Äôs been removed. And all 209 of my small boxes, my mega box, and my 25 big boxes have gone to waste 
---
I just read this. Ya the extra brawler count wow didn‚Äôt know that 
---
U pulled a bull tho 
---
Oh..... yeah true, any reason why he was disabled?
---
Br√ºd√™r c√°n u p√°≈°≈° m√™ th√™ C√ÅK√ä D√ÅY
---
So I was just unlucky I guess
---
Its ok brawl stars tweeted that there is a bug with gene ( that the game crash when u use his super )  dont worry ‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
You have to ask Blizzard, they have copyrighted the term. 
---
I blew a shit load of boxes. He‚Äôs gone. even a saved mega box 
---
Why did i switch brawler im so stupid lmao
---
Atleast My 30 Boxes didn't go to waste on a Brawler that'll get deleted in matter of seconds
---
Omg The people that Put him in level 10 THE MONEY
---
oof
---
When you click his super, the game crashes. I think the bug is only impacting iPhone users, but still a huge bug.
---
Crashes on ios device when ultimate is used
---
He had a bug so they removed him 
---
Me too man! I have opened the game to see Gene. After 5 minutes, I opened the game again and opened all my boxes. So after that I've just realized that Gene was GONE! WTF? I want my boxes back to have a REAL chance to have GENE. It's unfair SUPERCELL.
---
Lmao stop
---
I love this map xddd
---
You can use super without the game crashing?
---
I think you may be the chosen one...
---
Yes they had to remove him because of the bug
---
üòÇüòÇüò≠üò≠ kmsl I SWEAR THAT IS SO ACCURATE 
---
 overpowered brawler.  deals way too much damage. tanky.  best in gem grab and showdown.  can be used in brawl ball. don't go heist or bounty. 
---
INFINITE POWER!
---
Gene's passive: crash opponents game.   
---
Awesome release management Supercell fix your department!
---
They could make the game so much better just by fixing the solo queue problem... Match teams against teams and solo queues against solo queues if at all possible.
---
Noob
---
But its my job
---
Well I don't have that kind of cash to put my Brawlers at level 10  so yea üòï
---
r/wooosh
---
Will he be added again
---
Yeah it would be, i didnt have the issue seeing as im on note 9 but that would suck 
---
Me too F
---
Do you mean you open those boxes after they have disabled Gene? Bad luck man if that's what you mean. 
---
Same here bro. Over 209 regular boxes, 25 big boxes and a saved mega box from the quest. Only to realize he was yanked. I have everything maxed and now over 60k gold. 
---
Gene quits the battle
---
It will come the longer you play. Some users have been playing for over a year. 
---
I don‚Äôt have gene in my game like is just got taken off Bc off the bug or what happen???
---
Right, but I can still play him
---
In game I was even supered and the player didn‚Äôt crash? 
---
Exactly. I f*ing hate Twitter.
---
Actually it was 92 boxes.
---
because it‚Äôs low effort, and there‚Äôs another subreddit dedicated to loot box drops. this subreddit doesn‚Äôt need hundreds of pointless screenshot posts. they add no value 
---
Worst map of all time 
---
Ceka dey
---
Yes sir. I hope so. Same boat. Hundreds of boxes on two fully maxed accounts 
---
He didn't change brawlers while supercell disabled gene.
---
I got rejected by my valentine üòû
---
What I mean is that for some people he is gone from there brawlers the fore making him unplayable.
---
Me want more
---
uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
---
Ohh shittt sneaky
---
Really??? Not for me I haven't had any problems since global launch 
---
My friend just unlocked Gene about 30 minutes ago from a brawl box, AFTER he‚Äôs been disabled. I witnessed it as I was sitting next to him when it happened. He‚Äôs not on the roster though but it shows 23/22 brawlers (he has all of them).  So it looks like he can still drop from boxes. Don‚Äôt open yours if you‚Äôre still skeptical and want to be on the safe side though. 
---
My first post got 4 upvotes and removed 
---
When I use the super it doesn't crash though
---
Of course I‚Äôm joking smh
---
Oh yeah ‚ÄúNo one beats the bull‚Äù thanks for letting me know.
---
While he is disabled, some players have him selected as their brawler, allowing them to play with Gene. Additionally, the bug only impacts IOS devices, so that is likely why he didn‚Äôt crash.
---
Unlike some other said, you cannot unlock him right now. Save your boxes and show the Supercell message saying you cannot have him (in the comments here, but in Spanish) to the support.
---
Clearly they send contradictory information.
---
r/barleygang
---
I got Frank today
---
trident is the lamp.
---
Try changing the order. Releases brawler, Disables it, i open 90 boxes. 
---
AH! I just opened several boxes and wondered! Wasted all those boxes... Would have loved it if you made an OFFICIAL news/notice in game saying you're taking Gene out to investigate! Compensation for opened boxes... please? 
---
He just put money
---
Why would they be the same level? I know you are trying to make it fair, but that‚Äôs not how matchmaking works
---
could‚Äôve said ‚Äúafter using super‚Äù for gene too 
---
Next time read the notice section.
---
I'm Poppy Gloria here to report today's pew news *que intro*
---
At least we can joke about the 20 minute life span of Gene.
---
1 mega box, 26 big boxes and 210 normal boxes here :)
---
How about the trophies though
---
dddddddDDDDOUBLE  KILLL
---
Ouch
---
I am highly dissapointed in your post, how should they make money from a free to play game? 
---
Also sometimes weird bugs happens, thats pretty normal today and they directly try to fix it.
---
They work hard on brawlers, design and many more, and now they should give you and all others their hard work for free? 
---
Haaaa! GOTTEMMM
---
First thing I did when the Gene countdown ended was go to check his details on the hero selection screen, once I saw he wasn‚Äôt there I didn‚Äôt open any boxes. I can‚Äôt understand why anyone would open all their hard earned boxes without checking this first??
---
I even bought the Lunar Pack just now just to get those 2 mega boxes! :(
---
Who to is Ark &amp; Jeff?
---
excuse me but thiccochet *is* a religious idol 
---
I got Frank instead of Gene
---
They fixed it
---
Don't know if they can track the boxes you opened but if they can then it would be nice of them
---
Feels like CS:GO but it change guns.
---
U can get gene  In boxes even now. But u cant play with him...... I read that in one of the reddit post..... 
---
I know! This is stupid! I hope supercell is going to do something about it
---
No money if he saved chests
---
They cant use the News Button properly
---
Increase the luck percentage per brawlbox opened which didn't contain a brawler, it' pretty freaking frustrating when i opened 79 brawlboxes, 4 big boxes and 2 mega AND I GOT NOTHING, I STILL NEED TO GET TARA, MORTIS AND ALL THE LEGENDARIES and I'm sitting here with 4k trophies with no legendaries while people in 400 trophies already have all of them. What the fuck is this shitty broken luck chance 
---
r/woooosh
---
Supercell said otherwise on another post. Don't open your boxes !
---
Same here 
---
You act like you‚Äôve never seen this before 
---
I find it funny, that the Shelly face is next to the Zero Skill!
---
I agree, but they have been making more offices lately,but for now nothiy gonna change.
---
omg first is a romanian player
---
My wishes aren't available now, Gene fone with them, I've opened all my Boxes till realize that he's not in the game anymore üò™
---
Do you even have Gene? Cuz I‚Äôm pretty sure his attack ain‚Äôt the same as Penny‚Äôs. It doesn‚Äôt hit enemies behind each other. Also Gene has more health.
---
Well there is, mister. Clearly there is. 
---
Dnd kkkk
---
Because I haven‚Äôt why would I ask in the first place if I haven‚Äôt seen it 
---
I have never seen a gemmed that spends so much money in so little time that they maxed out a brawler in the 20 min that it was out
---
Yup. Unfortunately.
---
How do u have that?!?!!
---
Lol why are you here bragging, nobody really cares if you just bought everything
---
I don't want to say this, but yes, but I got him from a Big Box
---
No hat no life
---
Are you just self promoting your twitch? Read the rules man.
---
X2
---
"Are you sure about that"
---
Good thing I checked reddit. At least supercells doing something about it. üò¨
---
Happy cake day!
---
Where? When? Please link your source.
---
Couldn't find that on Reddit or Twitter...
---
Hope you are not referring to the statement on what happens when you already did unlock him before he was disabled.
---
(Not) 
---
Yes you can still unlock him and will get him when released again at least thats what I heard from a post
---
Me too
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=P6uCQfEP-n8
---
Check this video of coach cory‚Äôs
---
I think the first ever gun game modes were in cs 1.6 (or 1.5/earlier). There it was also knife last (and grenade second last). Mortis would be a fitting last character for it.
---
Hey, this is a mistake on the agent' s end. You will not be able to unlock Gene from any sources while he is disabled. I want to correct this erroneous response from our Support team, and sorry to everyone for this inconvenience!
---
Please get him back as soon as possible
---
It's pathy pirate 
---
They have added him, but he was removed because his super glitched
---
You could have still unlocked him from those boxes as confirmed by other users so there is no need for a refund 
---
All I'm saying is that they CAN implement all these ideas and other stuff. They can't say they are on a time constraint or lack of finances. They just choose not to develop these ideas.
---
3 gem mines?
---
So true
---
joke??
---
First of all, this isn‚Äôt my account it‚Äôs my friends, secondly I‚Äôm 9.5k entirely f2p so yea, and also I don‚Äôt think anyone really appreciates people going around heckling other peoples comments
---
Yeah
---
Source please...
---
And? Doesn‚Äôt mean he can‚Äôt tell you to calm down
---
I know I did it before he was gone so yeah
---
Also if that was the only brawler he had unmaxed and say he had 500 to 600 chests saved up. He will only get p.o. for gene so its very possible. I just wanted to throw my post in there to see if supercell will fix it or not
---
Should have put the meme inside the picture, not a screenshot
---
Ay man, it's All good, always appreciate a good convo :)
---
He pulled himself out of reality with his super
---
Aight chill I just woke up breathe and move on
---
During that time according to another redditor you still had a chance of unlocking Gene but wont get him till he is rereleased it just shows as 23/22 depending on the number of brawlers you habe
---
ü¶ÄGENE IS GONEü¶Ä
---
you cab still unlock him
---
Poor Frank...
---
Whatever you have heard is fake anf your comment ks misleading. You cannot Get gene for now from boxes until they add gene back. If it's not showing in brawlers page how can you get it?
---
he got the offer
---
Oh I guess that makes sense but it seems more like gemming because honestly it takes a while to open that many chests but idk
---
¬´fourthly SC Support has confirmed you can still unlock Gene form boxes now even though he is disabled.¬ª
---
Nice
---
developers, return gems for Gene !!!
---
jessie turet conformed:)
---
What poison modifier? 
---
No please save up your boxes
---
r/lootstars 
---
While I completely agree, it has been confirmed that you can still unlock Gene in boxes after he was removed. He‚Äôs just not available on the roster. 
---
But yeah, this is embarrassing on their part
---
he has the super of leon 
---
Get ready.
---
It makes me happy you let the bo get 2nd. 
---
OwO
---
Not cool, not cool!
---
called?
---
If you have him selected already dont switch and you can continue to crash people
---
this is before he was disabled are you retarded?
---
Really buff crow?you noobs. Crow the best brawler in the game. Because he range attack is very long! Its my opinion
---
Nobody cares, cause you destroyed the game stability  2 weeks ago
---
I had him selected then my switched it to leon
---
Happening to me too. Sad to see nobody tested this :/
---
Y'all piece of shhh... What about my f*ckin' 56 small boxes and my 9 big boxes? You s*cks!
---
Exactly what you did on my post. Talking without knowing crap
---
Without checking, it‚Äôs just not possible to have 110% chance to get him 
---
But I have to power of 12 Mercy's
---
I think it's random. If it's not, wow. If it is, then also wow
---
What about those of us who opened boxes without knowing about this? I bought the Lunar pack and I want a refund or a re-roll after he‚Äôs back.
---
Not at all.
---
Gene is balanced.
---
Anyone of the listed buffs will make him op.
---
Each brawler is unique and it's not required that every brawler can kill other brawler in 1v1 situation.
---
Gene is a support brawler (good in 3v3) that's why his star power heals friendly brawlers. 
---
And his range is quite long, along with the spread it is long. His damage is okayish. And you should pull low health brawlers with his super not tanks.
---
You must be downright retarded. His damage is shit, and he is super squishy. He definitely needs a buff.
---
She's supposed to have further range she isn't a tank
---
Out of existence
---
Oh good to know
---
He hasn‚Äôt changed the brawler since they disabled him, that‚Äôs why he kept him. 
---
Thats not what supercell said
---
Please before posting a question like this check the subreddit. This has been asked many times. If you had bothered to look around yourself you would see. Sorry for being rude
---
Same bro. 
---
Ok that was good ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞) 
---
Sounds like a star powerüòÑ
---
Yes, because it beats seeing ‚Äúwhere is gene‚Äù ‚Äúwhy can‚Äôt I unlock gene‚Äù ‚Äúwhy is my game crashing when I use gene‚Äù ‚Äúgene is t showing up in the leaderboard‚Äù 
---
:(
---
Malarkey 
---
Rip gene but look on my profile to see a map concept
---
Supercell themselves responded to that and said it was wrong
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/aquw61/not_sure_if_i_believe_this_tbh/?st=JS5Z0DTP&amp;sh=3124f93f
---
Although in all seriousness, I don't think this is an issue with people using the Galaxy S9+? I could be wrong but in the short time I played Gene I haven't experienced crashes or anything unusual.
---
A post on this subreddit where someone messaged support. I‚Äôm not going to scroll through the last 3 hours to find it, but it‚Äôs there 
---
You just didn‚Äôt get him, because you CAN still unlock without him being in the game. 
---
Not 100% p2w, 
---
You can wait till you get him and max. Or skip the time and use gems.
---
It‚Äôs ironic. They didn‚Äôt even test him out, they slapped a date and him and set him off
---
0.2464%
---
Soo, that blue rarity was just a placeholder? If so, he turned to be mithic rarity? 
---
I agree, immunity is OP if you‚Äôre trying to battle for the gems in spawn. 
---
Bro ur post is bad sorry he has a point 
---
haven‚Äôt been banned in brawl stars for 14 days! what should I do!
---
Oh hey rico didn‚Äôt you see come in
---
Original post.
---
Ha, syke
---
Whast? Eug√™nio
---
Stop riding Supercell‚Äôs dick
---
They never announced him as disabled, and it‚Äôs not the players fault for opening boxes when they specifically said he was inside boxes 
---
I've seen a couple people state it's affecting IOS. I've seen a few vids today of people who have unlocked him using their super without issues, so maybe it's only related to iPhones and androids are fine? Who knows.
---
A lot of phones these days have a Do Not Disturb  feature of some type. All iPhones, iPads and iPod Touch devices able of running iOS 9 or newer have Do Not Disturb mode.  Most android devices have the same feature, if it doesn‚Äôt the Play Store has similar functioning apps. Airplane mode wouldn‚Äôt work for Brawl Stars since it needs an internet connection. 
---
They responded that it's NOT possible!
---
¬´Hey, this is a mistake on the agent' s end. You will not be able to unlock Gene from any sources while he is disabled. I want to correct this erroneous response from our Support team, and sorry to everyone for this inconvenience!¬ª
---
Nita is so cute #LoveNita
---
Ok thanks so much everyone! 
---
 Well...I already spent my coins...
---
Well you should!
---
You will crash other people.
---
I think that when the count down finished and a bunch of people got him/her the game glitched out i dont even know if i should open my boxes or not
---
I guess if you open more boxes, you have a better chance in one sitting..? Other than that, no, it doesn't change anything. Whether you open 1 box or 10 boxes, the chance of getting the brawler is the same %, but obviously if you open more, you have more of a chance in getting a brawler in one sitting. 
---
The only other thing to know though is, if you unlock a mythic (gene), your legendary rates go down. Whereas if you unlock a legendary, your mythic rates don't go down (legendary rate will still go down). 
---
Nah, they are all over.
---
So if I did have him... it would say 23/22 brawlers right now?
---
It‚Äôs mythical cos apparently no one has ever seen it...
---
 ...happen cos all they get is a black screen
---
Remember there are only about 7 people on that team. And they probably couldn‚Äôt test gene out on our servers so the crashes were unexpected. Give them props for trying to fix it immediately.
---
The game crashed with his super being used, they obviously didn‚Äôt test it out
---
A Gene is released , then he re-enters the lamp :) 
---
GET IT? "HELL" Yeah?
---
supercell literally made a post saying he is available
---
Yeah i had 1000 gems left from last purchase and since i got all brawlers on lvl 8 with max power points it went super fast. Opened 5 mega boxes and alot of brawl boxes/big boxes
---
This is op and not op at the same time, why? Cus yes, it barely does any dmg BUT you can easily spam that attack into bushes exposing enemy players and preventing their health regen. 
---
This should not be possible. Could you possibly private message me your friend's player tag so we can verify this?
---
Nice.
---
i don't see the post you are talking about. Can you post something to confirm it?
---
this was an obvious joke
---
Gene isn‚Äôt there for me
---
I waited in agony for Gene to be released. Arguably he was late to be released and all of the bugs should have been ironed out. This is totally Mickey Mouse of them. I expected better. We pour money into this game and play by the rules. And now this? Yanked like a bad clown off of the stage 
---
His release was tha only thing that kept me excited. And then this happened 
---
Supercell said otherwise...
---
I‚Äôm sorry, but i have to disagree.
---
I have him, and he‚Äôs bad.
---
His range is quite long? no way
---
Ya, most of those who didn't get him want an excuse, like you aren't guaranteed 100% to get him even in 200 boxes.
---
YES! Thank you Supercell ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Yeah I‚Äôm pissed I wasted all of my boxes and got nothing.
---
RIP Gene. Press F to pay respects
---
They're's*
---
For more awsome game play and guide please visit [mmm lv1](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXc3-JVE7lrkTZ8H0s7CYSg) !!! Thanks!!!
---
Ok thank you so much I already contacted you guys before I saw this as I‚Äôm sure anyone would if they were in the same situation. I apologize for that and will go respond back!
---
Do you think that the pruvate servers did something because i know they exist from a video on youtube and when the player used gene's super the opponent was stunned but it didnt have  those stqrs flying above the heads of enemy brawlers like frank's stun
---
‚ÄúIt would also feel pretty bad to get kills 'stolen' by other players‚Äù
---
You know what else feels bad, getting killed by groups of players in a solo game mode.  I can understand if you don‚Äôt want to ban people because that‚Äôs a lot of work I‚Äôm sure and would hurt retention.  With that being says please consider measures to lessen teaming like not having maps that enable it.  Certain maps you literally get teamed up on by groups almost every single game, these maps shouldn‚Äôt be in the game.  
---
Where is the map?
---
I m talking about the spread of his attacks, just like spike's range is increased. 
---
Also he is a support brawler, that means he should be used extensively to support your mates. 
---
They should have locked boxes or have a system to lock boxes, or just put the game in maintenance...I don‚Äôt get why they would just randomly disable while people are excited and opening
---
here's a source saying it's NOT possible. :) lol
---
So there go all my boxes 
---
üòÇ 
---
No I‚Äôm not. I got leon at 400 trophies. So a lot of people thought I paid for him. I have really good luck on getting brawlers. I have all of them except for crow and spike.
---
You a little late dude it‚Äôs been gone for 2 hours atleast
---
Couldn‚Äôt of said it better myself
---
"For this weekend" aya worst game ever

Thank you.

Met a lvl 10 Gene... That's like only a few hours into releasing Whut 
---
Oh yeah and on your other post since you sounded like you knew everything I'll just leave this here and not say I told you so.

I agree I opened all of mine and he isn‚Äôt in the game. I had no idea.

I saw some of your concepts and I must say that I really like your Bo concept, it looks way better than the current model! About the game mode, I had this idea in my mind for quite a while already and got the inspiration from the famous Gun Game mode of other games like cs:go. I also thought that this mode would be good since it would be a new solo mode that would be different than any mode currently in the game. In showdown people people focus on surviving, in this mode people would focus on getting kills since that's how you win. This could even prevent people from teaming, since the sole focus is killing and not necessarily surviving. For the image, I just wanted people to understand the concept, without having too much information on there, so I just put the key points on the image. I also didn't want to be too specific and leave it open for discussion, at the end it's the devs that chose how the mode would work if they add it. I just wanted to get the idea out there :)
---
One time they gave everyone 50 boxes
---
we should call hime gone instead of gene
---
I like more Nita+Leon!
---
To be honest, I don't really know who to believe in  lmao

all good bros

Gene has been disabled due to a ‚Äúcritical bug‚Äù causing his special to crash the game. Everyone that has Gene unlocked will still have him once he is reenabled.
---
Don‚Äôt hold your breath
---
When you say for the weekend do you mean today? Or do you mean Saturday or Sunday?
---
r/MortisGang
---
Your logic makes no sense but alright
---
I don't find any fault here.
---
See, buying in brawl stars is necessary as it is the only way for b s team to earn revenue.
---
Dumbass, read the whole post, they said right after that u can‚Äôt 
---
They should've read the ingame newa
---
Still possible to pull him out of a box? 
---
If you want any specific brawler very bad, u can gem for it.
---
Yea I get it nice argument tho
---
There was an offer??
---
SC responded in the comments saying that the customer support rep was wrong
---
Great job and awesome response time! 
---
Best dev team &lt;3
---
hit em with the facts.  pay2win. still can‚Äôt play for shit üòÇüíÄ
---
What about the boxes I opened for gene?
---
Honestly, I hope they do a rollback, but I don't know how they'd exclude people that didn't want a rollback (got gene or got a legendary or something).
---
I also hope they don't just give everyone their boxes back and let you keep all the powerpoints and gold you unlocked, because that'd be pure bs too (easiest way to do it though). All the people that actually checked the brawler list / forums before opening would basically get a huge penalty for NOT opening their boxes. 
---
It's also unrealistic for SC to do this on an individual basis? There's just too many players with this issue.
---
I honestly have no clue what they're gonna do, but I bet a lot of people will be pissed at any decision they make. 
---
Thanks for the clarification.
---
Please did a solution for the problem with our spend boxes. We're all waiting for a reply on that.
---
oof. shouldve gemmed right away
---
Yeah, but supercell is most likely not going to fix it. Whenever you see a team larger than 2, just hide, or join them.
---
Stop writing this.... BRAWL stars said on Twitter that they are working on Gene and he will be released within few hours
---
I started opening boxes right when he was disabled... Rest in peace 91 boxes üò≠
---
Check the latest post by u/BrawlStars they confirmed you will be compensated
---
Hahha
---
I dont even try to comeback, i really just didnt understand what you try to stay, retired 
---
Listen, if you find gene listed in your brawlers list, you can get him from boxes. But if you are getting only 22 brawlers in the list, u can't get him for now.
---
I think he means Life Leech. Or whatever it was called
---
‚Äúsave up 100‚Äôs of boxes. lol you‚Äôre at 2000+ cups. what are you lying for üòÇ
---
Check out the new post by BrawlStars
---
I wish everyone gets compensated. Sure the people who opened boxes definitely need to get their boxes back or get a re-roll for drops but there's also several people like me who lost games because some random Gene decided to super on our screens when their team is about to lose.
---
You haven‚Äôt seen disappeared until you‚Äôve unlocked Leon.
---
üëåüèº
---
Look in the thread, support responded in the thread saying it's not possible. 
---
I had heaps of brawl boxes ready, and spent gems to get him and their was an offer for his star power and I bought that 
---
gene is gone!
---
Cool
---
Thanks for the compliment but I got gene so 10k here I come
---
Might I suggest to create a Public Test Server to allow players to find bugs to prevent another Gene situation
---
devs fuck up in coding... blames it on the system..
---
sure
---
They literally posted gene being disabled on their Twitter 3 hours ago, I‚Äôm not riding their dick I‚Äôm calling out entitled kids. People confirmed they unlocked gene in that time span of him being disabled anyway.
---
Literally me, been waiting since they disabled him, c‚Äômon it‚Äôs a easily known bug I know it‚Äôs an easy fix. 
---
You can't guarantee that you will get gene even in 200 boxes. It's a probability.
---
Oh sorry, my name is Ryan and I was so confused for a secondüòÇ
---
Well I‚Äôm sorry but your luck is bad...
---
Sounds great!
---
The order of brawler matters a lot I think, as the idea is kinda that it gets harder with later brawlers. Maybe start with some power ups and lose one every kill you get (while also getting a new brawler)
---
Some trophies versus weeks of saving boxes
---
This is my friends account I‚Äôm 9.5k entirely f2p
---
Gone, like my dad
---
He‚Äôs in the lamp, rub it! 
---
my patience is running thin
---
I bought gene
---
The best I can give you is: **as soon as possible**! :)
---
Getting sick of the same threads over and over again. 
---
What does 'compensate appropriately' mean? Because if it's 'keep all your powerpoints and gold you got from your 200+ boxes AND we'll give you 20 megaboxes' that'd be ridiculous and unfair for people that didn't open their boxes. 
---
I also lost my boxesüò¢
---
Yup I get that a lot, but not only that, but Clash Royal too. Legit had to push to Hog arena with a single legendary.
---
Exactly this is the idea. 
---
I cannot see enough movements!?
---
But my main is 9.5k f2p so don‚Äôt judge üòùüëå also an upvote??
---
"Hey Brawlers, unfortunately we've discovered a critical bug in Gene's super. We'll need to disable Gene until we can fix this issue. Very sorry for the delay in Gene's release and we'll update you as soon as we have more information."(Supercell Twitter)
---
Best Skin Ever &lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3
---
They owe us something BIG! Way to screw up supercell. I‚Äôm a big fan of what y‚Äôall do, but seriously!! Take him out in a maintenance break or something! Not just out of the blue when y‚Äôall know we‚Äôre all excited to get Gene! You owe us, big time.  
---
So some people still have him available for unlock and some dont? Wtf man
---
U slept for less than 4 hours, nice. 
---
Im saying bro
---
Before the weekend huh, so this is gonna take a full day to fix...
---
they make the smallest updates and we have to wait 3 months for a poor brawler who crash when it is release but yes "no sense"
---
Well there you go. Support was wrong (again) which they have been before. You can‚Äôt shoot the messenger 
---
I know right 
---
They never gave a time frame 
---
They mean within the weekend.  As early as Saturday to as late Sunday.  It's hard to pinpoint exactly how long it can take to fix an unforeseen problem. It's actually quite amazing that they're willing to dedicate the weekend to doing so, and two day window is quite reasonable.
---
Sadly not the first time the customer service does something like that...guess we're all only humans but it sucks!
---
I'm pretty sure I'm one of the only people who actually prefers this version of brawl ball.
---
aaaand now he‚Äôs not!
---
Thank you 
---
Clash royale legendaries are a joke now tbh. Back in 2016 I still remember the feeling when I got the miner from a free chest. Now I have all of them just sitting there and getting them left and right since the pool has like 8 more legendaries that you can get
---
I will gladly accept that answer lol
---
How are the boxes going to be compensated?
---
If they really received it after it was disabled then very unlikely supercell is currently stopping ppl from getting from the boxes. Still, should just ask for screenshots from those who got the confirmation from SC that you can still get gene from boxes, just that u can‚Äôt use him right now. I think this is the clarification that is needed
---
I'm getting a sick form of satisfaction at all the people who saved up 400 boxes now demanding they get them back. 
---
Thanks for the silver! 
---
And the when will the compensation occur? Cause i have opened more than 400 boxes
---
Shame on supercell it's not like they could have tested this before...! 
---
·é∑·éæ·é°·é¢·èÜ·èö ·è©·é™N·è©
---
No he‚Äôs not here
---
Ok... nice flex, supercell must legit have favortism XD
---
People affected by this will be automatically compensated in-game. 
---
Supercell should give us some apologice boxes
---
We don‚Äôt care 
---
No, but you're encouraging everyone to waste they're boxes and than downvote my clarification. Are you well friend?
---
Ya that's a good point. I hope they figure out a fair solution.
---
Happy cake day 
---
I currently am using gene.. I have him power level 7 currently and I got off the app after I experienced the crash.. I can still use him if I don‚Äôt switch to a different brawler 
---
Just saying we haven‚Äôt gone in contact with the other 3 gangs but Shelly might be an enemy 
---
Does it mean we won't be able to buy the lunar year offer for a chance to get Gene? 
---
Will you extend the Lunar offer for those who wanted to buy it to get Gene ?
---
Love Crow but he needs at least a health buff, he‚Äôs so frail...
---
R u dumb
---
Wait, what did they remove him for? I just woke up.
---
That's his star "other" power actuallly
---
146 boxes...6 big boxes...lunar offer and 1 saved megabox wasted...damn
---
Might cause too much lag
---
Hey i wanted to huy the special offer for lunar new years to get gene and now i cant !
---
My weekend is tomorrow but eh, didn‚Äôt expect to get him anyways.
---
Nvm
---
F to those who used the boxes. 
---
I hope you don't punish players for not opening boxes because we checked forums / brawler page before opening. (ie: those that opened you give them their boxes back and compensation vs those that didn't open any, they get nothing). 
---
Woah, what about the lunar offer?? I was saving it for gene and the offer ends today. Can we get this fixed before it expires please?
---
Thank you so much for your work! &lt;3
---
I mean, imo it‚Äôs still a mistake on their part to open 300 boxes without checking the brawler screen first
---
Ok then, then u go make a better game. 
---
Flex? I quit the game more than 7 months ago and there‚Äôs nothing in it for me to flex
---
Just saying that legendaries just didn‚Äôt feel like legendaries when every person had them
---
(In cr)
---
I used 100 boxes :/
---
I know. But i will be doing a challenge for him. Level 1 Crow and i ll see i can push him to 400 trophies without powering him up. Crow needs a little more Health
---
Cool, you‚Äôre gonna be that guy that freezes the whole lobby. 
---
Yes I agree, the order is really important. So first of all I believe that everyone should have the same order of brawlers so it does stay kinda fair. I was thinking that maybe the last brawler should be the same every game (someone in the comments suggested Mortis since he's one of the harder brawlers to master). But the order of the other brawlers could differ from game to game. I also think that one game should not include all brawlers because it would take to long to go through them all. So for example a set of 10 Brawlers that is random each game, except the last brawler that would always be Mortis, and in the game itself the players would get the same 10 brawlers in the same order as their opponents.
---
Thanks for the compliment! And I really appreciate the in depth explanation! This is a very well thought out approach.   I especially like how you managed to convey the general idea so succinctly and clearly.  I will definitely have to try this out!
---
Not me...
---
Hehe,yeah
---
Same bro
---
Glad they seem to be on top of this though, the response time was quick :)
---
Unprofessionall 
---
Where did I say ‚Äúgo and waste your boxes‚Äù ? How is it my fault that support was wrong ??? And I‚Äôm not your friend. By the way SC has communicated with us 15 min ago and said everyone who was effected will be compensated 
---
Not our fault we were sleeping 
---
I wish people browsed and read the subreddit instead of instaposting.
---
Didn‚Äôt happen to me, but it‚Äôs still Supercells mistake and Supercells only.
---
They didn‚Äôt even warn the players online.
---
I wanna buy the lunar offer hurry up ;-;
---
Hacker
---
It is kinda wack. 
---
I didn't open my boxes yet.  I didn't lose anything.  Why should I get any compensation? 
---
Interested to see how you handle the compensation, 60 boxes and the lunar offer and I got Tara, could've been Gene!
---
When?
---
Reply doesn‚Äôt show aim
---
Oh shoot this meme came too early
---
I wanted gene but i got spike :(
---
Brawl Stars,Please read this:the moment I got Gene,I had to go out for some work....when I returned and logged in,I found that you removed Gene.... luckily my Gene was on the home screen...and now I still have him and I am still able to play with him without any Bug
---
I guess the drop rates should be increased
---
I am sure they need to rewind back the progress at the last second before Gene launches.
---
And return all the boxes that has been opened by today.
---
Lastly, I bought Gene from the shop and I confirm I still play it, open boxes and get Gene power points. So it is unfair to all other players who don‚Äôt have Gene yet. 
---
So, rewind Gene to LV 1 and Rank 0.
---
Just keep playing my guy lol I poured way too much time into both of these games
---
His super crashed the game for everyone.
---
Thanks!
---
AndroidGang
---
Broken beyond repair
---
I got a new Brawler so i am happy. I ll get Gene some other day
---
Beautiful
---
Sameeee, supercell just hates me :(
---
Will you extend the duration of the lunar year offer for people who wanted to buy it to get Gene? 
---
They won‚Äôt, gonna take a day or so. 
---
r/CrowGang ftw
---
Lol,no
---
Opened 2 big boxes and 18 Brawl boxes and realized Gene wasn‚Äôt even available after finishing it
---
Pls rollback
---
Doubt it, probably a day or two. 
---
Thanks. How do you like my stats?
---
How many trophies u lost bro
---
Ofcorse it might this map is just.to enjoy the pleasure of breaking skulls.
---
Dude wtf, they are literally working their asses off, and then there is one bug that comes out of nowhere so they have to fix this immediately. Its not like they planned to have this bug. So they are trying to fix this as fast as possible and all they get is one ungrateful guy who shit talks them...
---
I wasn‚Äôt saving boxes but donated real money to play him today
---
When something like this happens, usually I give the company the benefit of the doubt. Not for Supercell. To hype up a new brawler for WEEKS only for the brawler to be glitched, then pulling him out of the store without an ingame notification is pretty much a scam, especially as I‚Äôm writing this hes still not in the game??? Supercell needs to be held more accountable for this bullshit, this type of stuff has been consistent with them.
---
üëç
---
Leon is your only 500? Ew lol
---
Will the offer be available again after te fix ? I already bought the gems for the offer
---
Whoever's saying they unlocked him no pun intended is bs 
---
Liar
---
He‚Äôs the easiest the rest I have are at 400
---
No they said for the weekend that means probably today or not tommorow morning
---
Hello guys, can someone explain to me how it is possible, that I just have the basic Brawlers (nothing above super rare) with 4886 trophies and a lvl of 69. Friends of me which are much lower in both ways, have more brawlers then me. I feel like disadvantaged.
---
OMG SAME
---
Keeping those complainers aside. I Strongly Appreciate that you guys took immediate action on this Problem and issued notices on your next plans and now Working hard to Resolve this! What's more Amazing is that you understand the Frustration of players and at the end looking forward to compensate them in a way to retreat back their Hardworked Boxes so that they have a fair chance to open up gene again, Especially those would be a lot happy who weren't immediately get informed or aware of the gene issue. I've never seen a game being this much serious and bringing everything back on track! Once again thank you guys!
---
Same goes to u, don't say that when he isn't released long enough yet, wait for more gameplay since he is currently removed now. 
---
Yes. :)

Eugene canceled?

It could be beta players
---
So we waste all the stored boxes for nothing... nice move, Supercell.
---
PROBABLY with gems, but I'm not the one who decide so don't linch on them if you don't get gems lol
---
Then why is Royal Agent Colt 150 gems
---
Me too. Or just give gene to me
---
Will everyone be compensated? Even the people who didn‚Äôt open any boxes but patiently waited for the release?
---
I hope you are kidding dude. 
---
Every environment (read it as ‚Äúserver‚Äù) has different configurations, performances, ecc. 
---
Software houses have, normally, 3 different stages for a new development, and everyone of them belongs into a different server. 
---
The first one is accessible only to developers, in order to test first stages of the development, the second one is open to mass tester, and the third one, the ‚Äúproduction‚Äù environment, is the one we all access to play the game. 
---
Every server is different from others, things like the one happened during the Gene release may happen even if they have a mass test server. 
---
Also, consider that the creation of a dedicated server like you suggested costs a lot of money! 
---
Thanks for the communication and good luck solving the issue! 
---
Yes, i'll get my old gene
---
Same. I‚Äôm so fucking pissed 
---
To be frank, they would have to change their name. 
---
[Proof you can not](https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/aqvs4k/proof_that_you_cant_unlock_gene_when_he_is/)
---
I also thought that, but here is the proof.
---
Before the global launch. 
---
I unlocked him on my mini, am I gonna be able to play with him?
---
It's rewing time to previous code.
---
True, but 9/10 people will die at 1 point
---
No it aint
---
Agree. Coming up with a very good skin and being chosen is extremely difficult
---
Yeah opened a good amount of boxes just to realize he's unattainable &gt;.&lt;
---
On the brawlstars Reddit, not the home page
---
But why?
---
He isn‚Äôt, they are just finalizing him being ‚Äúvaulted‚Äù. He won‚Äôt be re-added until later today at the earliest and Sunday evening at the latest
---
Repost and don‚Äôt deny it 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/aqw7np/thats_how_it_should_be/?st=JS61W5HA&amp;sh=1afb103d
---
Why should you get 60 brawl boxes for free? You claimed rewards from the ones you opened. If you opened them without checking the brawler list first, its your fault otherwise hopefully supercell will compensate
---
No, they are just finalizing him being vaulted
---
Good one buddy.
---
Upvote for remember the "good" ol' days
---
Probably now as there is a maintenance break 
---
Maybe because I opened them just after they disable the brawler? Just maybe üëåüèΩ
---
I wonder if they'll let you keep what you got out of those before
---
How do you get a brawler name next to your username? 
---
How long will the Maintenance break probably last?
---
Did you heard about FaceTime bug? 
---
And Apple is one of the biggest company nowadays ;) 
---
Shits may happens to everyone, just keep calm ;) 
---
172 here and 5 bigs
---
They're gonna make an update to fix a Gene bug, they removed him because his super made people crash. Supercell said they'd fix it this weekend
---
I don‚Äôt get it
---
Same, I enjoyed this mode so much in other games!
---
Today is gene magic day
---
Repost, and if you are gonna repost, be smart about it and don‚Äôt post it 3 minutes after the original one.
---
Yeah xD
---
Yup that‚Äôs me
---
Do you know r/brawlstarscompetitive its just like here but much more serious
---
I'm the only one who, before spending all the boxes, has gone to see his statistics .. without finding them
---
Then just don't talk about money cause your argument is once again dumb.
---
It's like you go to a bar, ask a beer, waiter comes in and drops the glass, then refuses to compensate you or give you back the money, and another customer comes telling you "don't get mad, with this low amount of money, it won't hurt you, your wife, or anyone else"
---
Someone told me it was only a a glitch and he's actually available 
---
Downvote for repost
---
Maybe if it's not today it could be tomorrow! I think after the maintenance they will be release new major update just for fixing this issue! My thought was that after the maintenance we will see him but if it's not today it could be tomorrow or next week! 
---
it's over
---
It‚Äôs done
---
If you play with randoma you are a random 
---
Well I did actually got Gene I got it with gems and then I went to my Brawlers and ¬°BAM! Nothing there.
---
Doesn‚Äôt appear as I own Gene and also doesn‚Äôt appear as I don‚Äôt own Gene.
---
Mortis is still the best
---
I mean it's not their fault they didn't know gene wasn't able to be opened... they did release him and no one knew it would crash the game or he would be removed
---
We did it together lol
---
Dude shut up,that's just bad luck
---
Maddd
---
Probably no the offer wasn't intended to be purchased to get Gene 
---
Me too, i losed 120 normal boxes, 5 big boxes and 1 megabox, incluiding 2 megaboxes of the new year offer!!! I want it back or something similar
---
Gene was able to be unlocked, as mosat just stated, if you unlocked Gene your brawlers would say 23/22 but you won‚Äôt be able to use him until release. So no, they didn‚Äôt commit fraud.
---
Thank man
---
Crab Rave!
---
Yes
---
can i upvote more than once?
---
That's not how that works, it would take time for the new developers to get the old deleveper's vision. And the other teams may ask why The BS team gets more employees and not the other teams
---
Why was he removed
---
What did his super do that required him to back out of the game? Did it open a rift in the space time continuum? 
---
Triggered*
---
Apparently its confirmed yoy can unlock him
---
What happens to players who already unlocked gene?
---
I see what you did there ;)
---
But yes, I totally agree with you, all brawlers would make these mode too long, 5/10 brawlers per game sound good!
---
He wasn‚Äôt in the game so yeah that‚Äôs unfair. But I‚Äôd like to bring to your attention that u were complaining about opening ~100 boxes while gene is 1/400 chance. A star power is 1/100. So really it‚Äôs not surprising that you got nothing ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Worth it. Spike is a really good brawler.

Im all for speed so.... im 100% with you on dis one

They should make a healer that shoots teammates and enemies, like Ana from ow(don‚Äôt criticize me for playing :p)
---
Done and no Gene :(

Hi there, thanks! :D

Me and ale_musa we are friend and i send this pic make by myself and reclick the link

and I‚Äôm supposed to believe this happened after investing in quality assurance? Rightttt....

Valentino Khan - Pump plays

Reading is difficult. 
---
They look very similar let‚Äôs say someone uploads picture A and it‚Äôs the first, and someone else looks at it and changed a few things (picture b) they look so similar people think *oh this is a repost* and they type it in the comments 
---
Don't give them the tag, they'll just remove Gene from his account or something like that. We aren't even guaranteed a roll back. 
---
Is me DL395 xd
---
If that's your intention maybe it should have been worded in that way. Because most people will think you're calling them cry babies and dramatic, mainly because they're kids
---
lol me
---
Ok I see a new frank post on Twitter that gene will probably could be coming after lunar new year offer sold out so I think it's going to be tomorrow! 
---
A new update ??
---
If you haven‚Äôt seen the pinned post, they‚Äôre addressing the problem with a patch and they‚Äôve said that they will compensate us.
---
IF I've unlocked Gene AM I going to get HIM back? I've spent my money!!! 
---
Walter
---
Same 
---
That‚Äôs called envy, asshole. 
---
r/ihadstroke
---
It was not their fault, bugs are in every game and they did told everyone right away in the news tab
---
Or maybe not
---
Looooool
---
Nope
---
Would love to see this one!
---
Will you extend the lunar event? A lot of people were waiting for gene event to get the offer.
---
Well I hate myself too :)
---
question, does everyone's device (in both teams) crash or only yours? 
---
I saved up all my boxer hoping to get Gene. I opened them all and achter opening all my boxes I found put he was out of the game. Are theze boxes going to be given back?
---
And getting brawler from box impacts only legendaries
---
They but we have to see what will the compensation be. Will it be worth? I dont know
---
Buff crow
---
How on earth did his bugs pass your QC? Is it not possible to test on live servers with him before enabling him for mass release? 
---
Please do it Supercell!
---
I know it can happen... but think with me... how many bugs does clash royale have? If you dont play i can say, A LOT! How many bugs brawl stars have? A lot... they dont solve this old bugs, just leave them there, also, they told us about gene without even testing it? I really cant understand, or dix the old bugs, or stop giving us new ones... of course a bug is not easy to discover, but, gene CRASHED the WHOLE GAME with whoever he was playing... look how big this bug is... if gene wasnt getting/doing damage on online games, i would tottally understand your point... but no, it is a big bug, without them solving the others bugs... Shit can happens? Yes, it can ! But not this critical with this frequency on a big company, tbh look how much money they ask u to pay for a legendary brawler... dont you think gameplay quality should be this high too?? I think we are paying more money for a worst job from them, as a customer i am very and truly disapointed...
---
This did not age well
---
Nice piper skills 
---
Yeet same
---
Maybe they can give you those boxes back, but they would have to take away everything you've got from the boxes. That seems pretty complicated to do.
---
creator of a skin should get $10 in value? Wow what an idea
---
Whats the name of this program
---
It happened to me... 
---
You should enter it into the map making competition that‚Äôs going on right now. 
---
Yes it's definitely normal. I have 3200+ and if I hadn't spent 100 gems a few days ago for the 2 Epics deal I had, I would still have no Epic, Mythic, or Legendary. I haven't gotten a new brawler in about a month now. That's just how the game rolls. That's why they have these offers in the shop, because they know people don't have the patience to open the amount of boxes it takes to unlock more brawlers.
---
Considering link 2 see this answer:

---
Iv been saving up my chest for a few weeks now grinding the game and I got gene on my second to last chest and I was so hyped to get him like a few mins after he went live and when I tried playing with him game kept crashing hopefully they will fix it soon I didn‚Äôt even get to win a game with him because it kept crashing :( 
---
Darryl would be op
---
Demon gene is better
---
"Am I a joke to you?"
---
I just hit 4K and got my first in the mega box
---
there's no way *all* the people on here complaining about this have all of the other brawlers and are otherwise account maxed. it's not like those megaboxes are fucking useless because they're missing out on their 0.0xx chance at randomly hitting Gene in them. (chance of hitting a brawler at all x chance its a mythic x chance its specifically Gene)
---
I get it, obviously it'd be great if he is available when the deal is purchased, but this is not the sky falling situation p
---
It‚Äôs ok guys. You are working hard at this game
---
Take your time
---
We can wait a little
---
Just curious how they gonna code it , revert the boxes opened in that time for all players or all except gene owners
---
I don't believe it if it doesn't happen to me, sorry. 
---
Don‚Äôt become like EA, Supercell.
---
Well some skins creators are F2P so a free skin and a "thanks" would be cool.
---
Aaaand he‚Äôs gone.
---
Probably unsafe for 2 players to right next to each 
---
I‚Äôve had this bug too
---
Tbm estou com 9k e n√£o tenho,t√¥ s√≥ com 18 brawler t√° dif√≠cil s√≥ o Barley que n√£o t√° classe 20 
---
Made me check smh
---
A good pirate never steals
---
All my brawlers are maxed so it only takes like five or take 100 boxes to max him
---
Your right. I remember things like this happening in clash royal and they just gave people some free chests in the shop as a special offer for a limited time. This is probably what will happen.
---
Why not keep him still available in boxes but disable him for matchmaking until the problem is solved?
---
6k No mythics No leggies for me 
---
Kinda small, too much pinch potential at the bridges which sucks. 
---
He looks like genie tho....
---
It's normal , I didn't had any legendary or mythic till I was at 8.5k , I got mortis at 8.5k and Tara at 9k but still no legendary and I am at 9.7k now :(
---
i would like to see deadpool leon since he came out tbh
---
Us suckers are getting reimbursed üòÇ I hopee
---
Would the boxes get rewinded?
---
Good job Owen, you never dissapoint! The map is looking sweet :) Really like the concept of 4 separate regions and it's well executed. Some constructive critisism; the center might be too narrow. All the water, while cool looking, takes away a lot of the space. You could probably remove some of it to have a more diverse end game. Perhaps exchange some of it for regular walls? You dont really have that much cover.
---
A part from that, I really like the rest of the map! Good luck in the contest :)
---
Why? You don‚Äôt seem to have as much experience as me, you seem to have been playing from a shorter time... i‚Äôm a maxed player, it happened more than once. You have that screen too, it it couldn‚Äôt happen, it wouldn‚Äôt exist
---
I immediately came to this sub to find out why he was missing from my brawlers lol 
---
Ah that‚Äôs good to hear. Would help if I found a decent band or club whatever they call it now. I got the game when it was in beta 
---
Thanks for understanding. If you want a recording of the gameplay then see my recent posts in my profile. I have linked a YouTube video i made of it.
---
A good penny steals my power cubes
---
Nice Leon
---
Exactly my point, cause I play both of them fine on my internet which supercell says it‚Äôs my internet connection... baffling been since August they just keep giving me the run around saying contact my internet provider lol...
---
\- Why is he on an english forum, english subreddit and english thread?
---
\- Why does he understand the comment above? If he understands english he can probably speak some too. Also there is google translate otherwise. 
---
I'm not a native speaker myself so I have no problem with people not speaking english but I just think it's weird. 
---
I‚Äôm seeing conflicting information. I also saw comments from a user called brawlstars_support and they said that the customer service agent who sent that message was incorrect.
---
Supercell would contact you, you would give them your username in the game and through support they give it to you.
---
And then one guy tells me im trash for saying she needs a nerf SHE NEEDS A BIG NERF YOU CANT CHANGE MY MIND!!!
---
This screen appears after you buy the offer, since gene is disabled they just removed it instead of replacing it. 
---
OMG, I hope we both get one soon! 
---
Gene: Crashes game
---
SC: it's rewind time
---
Be happy 
---
It‚Äôs an upgraded form of Leon‚Äôs super.
---
If they happen to be on voice, why would they spin?
---
I know  hahaha
---
I really like this one
---
At least you'll get him back. People who opened boxes after his removal hoping to get him are probably clash royally screwed. At least, if these people do not take part in the "those affected by the inconvenience".
---
Lobber nation should be the new titleüåö
---
Bro im at 7000 cups and NO LEGENDARIES so...yeah
---
I know that jene will kill my legendary chances again üò≠
---
And who else wants to roll on the edges with Darryl?
---
Harsh:(
---
No!
---
Yet, if you can‚Äôt receive any offer, this will appear too (for example, box offers or brawl offers, level pack etc)
---
Shit happens. Nice to see you guys are working so hard to fix this mess as soon as you can. 
---
It is not sure that there was not the possibility to get him, I heard about people who got it from boxes after it was deactivated...
---
Do i understand this right.. so she shot 1 super to those 2 enemies and so many shells hitted that they automatically charged the super up?
---
I agree that would be the fairest thing to do for everyone. Those that opened the boxes and those that didn't. But don't expect the fairest solution. Expect the solution that still turns a profit. They could still make money from people upgrading Gene but it's not likely that it will be enough to suit them. I'm still waiting for a response from supercell. 
---
Guys it‚Äôs just his super
---
I opened before update and got crow so I don't feel bad...
---
Hmmm I m at 8.9k and All my brawlers are rank19 and some 20 except for mortis.. in which primo is one of my lowest trophies brawler right now so how did I main or push only specific brawler lol 
---
No way I‚Äôm paying to get this this time. 
---
Idk, it never happened to me yet so until it does, I don't believe it. 
---
Because using the super made the game crash.
---
I opened 50 boxes and I find out that Genesis deleted, SUPERCELL REFUND!!!
---
Yes and not once but twice
---
you can see" last seen "of players . try joining one that can has 15 or more players with 3.5k trophies or more. 
---
I was one of the fools who stayed up until 2AM to watch him launch, can‚Äôt complain from my end but did lose a handful of trophies. Super C should definitely extend that Lunar bundle for those of you who missed out though. Can see your frustration.
---
Anything goes in showdown 
---
I want old tank-darryl back idk but I liked him so much more before his rework...
---
I was waiting for this post
---
To know It‚Äôs there teammate because names are gone.
---
Now this is comedy
---
Not that poor if you can destroy a tablet just because.
---
darryl
---
Yeah... we know...
---
Ya Ik but what do you expect suoercell to do? It is hard to notice bugs before adding stuff to the game. Those people should've made sure he was actually there. 
---
But why
---
Wow! Doesnt happen with bulls shotgun even once :p
---
Imagine being Bull and not being able to hide.
---
Please 
---
I'm talking about the strategy 
---
They actually took a lot of inspiration from brawl stars. I remember there menu looked a lot like old brawl stars menu. 
---
I haven‚Äôt really looked much because I‚Äôm only at 1200 cups. But I‚Äôve got crow maxed and I‚Äôm close with bo. Thanks for the tip
---
if it was not agreed to join the game at the beginning you see that they do not spin and dyna leaves a box so that is a clear sign of being coordinated, also they are from the same clan ...
---
Unless of course we didn‚Äôt open our boxes yet.
---
I don't think that's correct.  Link to where that was said?  Last I read is that they would compensate players who opened boxes while he was disabled.  Why on earth would they say that if you could still receive him during those openings?
---
I‚Äôm guessing it was something like a console log in html. While testing Gene in the offline dev build, they used something like a console log. But when it went to the online server, it sent up an invalid command causing the server to output an error and force crash. 
---
I‚Äôm probably far off from the truth, but I‚Äôm just speculating the type of problem that occurred.
---
Hi supercell, are you going to be able to rerelease by any chance gene today? Or do we have to wait for tomorrow or something? Hope this gets fixed any time soon. Best regards
---
I woke up but didnt get to do anything because my wife woke up too so I put my phone down and laid back down. Wake up to gene-gate. 
---
He says "My pretties"
---
I opened 2 large, 7 big and 56 mini and got nothing. 
---
Giving him to everyone who logged on and opened a box since he was supposed to be released would make everyone happy lol
---
Be sad
---
I got spike. Wasnt disappointed 
---
WHAT about people who opened boxes when it released (after 8AM GMT) hoping to get him.
---
Oh no
---
No
---
I don't see him to 
---
maybe a really discounted offer? like 100 gems?
---
Well, I *can‚Äòt* actually 
---
Lmfao it was common sense to make sure he was available before spamming your boxes lol I woke up checked and got a little upset but got to keep my boxes still now I have a chance to gain 3 more boxes today works out lol 
---
Wait so is this a joke? I'm confused. Now that I think about it it makes sense since I still have to find Tara, Gene and the leggies, so if you are maxed out obviusly you don't have offers, because you already have everything. 
---
This is so ridiculous that you would not show ANY Brawler Gameplay of Genie for almost two weeks. No YouTubers, no Brawl Talk about it, NOTHING. We were all excited, saved up all our chests, were waiting for the YouTubers to be able to show gameplay, and were patiently waiting even though you would not show us a single thing about the Brawler. This is so ridiculous that the Brawler has probably gone through a month of play testing, two weeks of waiting and not being showcased by any player, and now it has a critical bug that could have been fixed! This is so stupid and could have been easily prevented. 
---
Not any more 
---
They had their shot on getting him so I dont think they will get anything.
---
Gotta put all the trash together
---
Pidgey used leech Life 
---
That's not fair because I was going to get him.
---
Is the maintenance  over?
---
I tried that with Shelly
---
Ok thanks
---
But they did make the effort to tell people, that‚Äôs why this post is here.
---
Yes, there will be compensation for people who tried to get gene while he wasn‚Äôt available
---
You can‚Äôt test gene on the public server without pushing him out to everyone, I‚Äôm sure Supercell tested him on private servers and he functioned just fine.
---
You should be glad that they took action so fast in an effort to fix this bugged character, and that people will be compensated for their mistake
---
I now can still open boxes for Gene power points....
---
So what action will SuperCell do on this issue ?
---
Yup
---
Doubt that this refund will be worth of 5 big boxes and 81 brawl box. Maybe they will give additional gem discount to buy gene from the shop. Pfff...
---
Repost
---
How will compensation go. Will we get all of our boxes back? 
---
Why did I laugh?
---
Hi, I bought a $10 offer for reaching level 50, it contained 2 mega boxes that I opened as soon as I get them for a better chance to get Gene, then I opened 1 mega box and 3 regular boxes just to find out he was temporarily removed. Is there a way to get any kind of compensation for at least the mega boxes I opened? 
---
When the 100 brawl boxes you save for gene give you nothing and then you realize gene wasn‚Äôt even released
---
So you are checking Twitter before and after every single box you open?
---
I‚Äôm speaking about everyone, not just me. Just pointed out that not only box-collectors were affected. 
---
No it is a genuine refund, you probably will lose all your items you got from them but you have a chance of getting him then. 
---
The oldest available archive.org archive of this subreddit shows that in July 8th of 2018 there were 10,182 subscribers. Today, February 15th 2019, there are 115,848 subscribers.
---
(I‚Äôve added 8 upvotes to the old post to try and account for the growth of the subreddit, this hardly changes the results regardless) 
---
If your post had 75 upvotes in a subreddit with 10,000 users, 0.75% of the total users would have upvoted. This post has 2.6k upvotes in a subreddit with 115,000 users meaning that just over 2.26% have upvoted this suggestion. 
---
The difference is clear. But what if your post was posted today and got the same percentage of traction it did back then? It would have received a grand total of 863 upvotes, not even breaking 1k.
---
There are definitely more children in the subreddit after the global release. That doesn‚Äôt change the facts that the suggestion 9 months ago was a poor quality post that got the same amount of traction that had effort put into it.
---
But yeah, gun game would be fun!
---
How did you get crow near your name?
---
Me too...
---
If anything you should be compensating everyone so that way everyone gets equal chances (meaning everyone gets like 3 Mega Boxes.) 
---
does he have a skin that is invisible?? cause i cant see him
---
FBI OPEN UP
---
I would expect supercell to compensate every user in the game for this and not only people who opend their boxes without knowing gene removed and got nothing. 
---
I can‚Äôt, but I have fingers to type.
---
Thought that was rico ü§î
---
Yes he is!
---
I‚Äôm with you on that the people should have checked before opening however it is still supercell‚Äôs fault and not testing their brawler and removing gene. Supercell basically scammed the people who opened all of their boxes and they deserve to be compensated.
---
Is gene deleted or no
---
I didnt mean that legendarie brawlers should be stronger, just that casually the other brawlers of his rarity casually are both strong brawlers. 
---
I agree with you in that the game should be balanced and focused on competitive and not only focused in money. I think that If more people enjoy the game they will make more money than with a p2w game (and I hope that I am not wrong). 
---
Totally.
---
Eitherway someone loses. Reverse the game and people with progress or people that already pulled gene will lose. Don't reverse and people that spent boxes and money will lose. 
---
F me I didn't know and opened lile 35 boxes and bought 2 Mega Boxes... Guess who's an idiot guys
---
P.S.: I even bought the 11‚Ç¨ offer... FFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUU
---
Bought the gene offer went away for a while. I come back to play after abt 20 mins. Gene removed. Disappointed:(
---
I won't forgive you
---
F-ortnite
---
I also got him before he was taken out I opened all of my brawl boxes I saved didn‚Äôt get him used my gems and got him in the shop then went to sleep woke up pissed off that supercell hade over 2 weeks they could of been testing him for bugs but decided to do shit 
---
I agree 100% with you on the people abusing this situation! I would be fine if they took the gold and tickets etc and just gave me back my boxes. When  I logged on and started opening my boxes there was no warning in the news page:/ all the people trying to abuse this situation just make it bad for everyone else.
---
Gg
---
No I want my boxes back so I can pull level-tokens for him. 
---
You really felt the need to post this on reddit??
---
Crab rave
---
Yeah but it‚Äôs not that good tbh. Not many deals
---
Yes, but not a single sign of Gene's life
---
Won't they block my account if I do?
---
What about us suckers who saved up boxes with hopes of getting Gene and not getting a warning he was not there and wasted the boxes.. like 109 of them :(  
---
So I spent 10 bucks on the Mega Box deal with the coins and got Rico instead.  Yay. :(
---
Absolutely me. It's sad to see everyone whining about their saved boxes. Should have double checked, and there was no guarentee of gene. Doesn't matter how long you saved, it wouldn't be fair to give you rerolls, even if they took away the loot you got. If they're going to give out free boxes, everyone should get them.
---
Woooow ut also took time to get the idea
---
His super crashed the game
---
xd
---
They won't. I even says in the message that you get when you finish the tutorial
---
I'm sure you've never made a mistake before in your life. lmao get a grip, it's a very minor mistake and they're being open and transparent in addition to offering compensation for anyone that was inconvenienced by the issue. They're handling the situation with total professionalism and anyone that's whining about it is being a total douche
---
Then, The #Bots start fighting 
---
Isn't this the Duo Showdown Gene and Leon?
---
Oi
---
SWIMMING WITH THE FISHES!
---
FIX. YOUR. INTERNET. TURN. OFF. CAPSLOCK. 
---
Noooooo Leon was op and he still is op albeit not as much but he is still a top tier choice. I don‚Äôt know how 3 shots to kill a box is weak, Leon‚Äôs burst damage is still amazing and his super nerf wasn‚Äôt that bad you actually have to time it now instead of just spamming it. 
---
they need to roll back the boxes and rewards of players affected, this is pathetic
---
"Appropriate" notice. That's why they call you and don't send letters. Letters can be missed. Calls have to be ignored. Damn that's basic to me. What don't you understand ?
---
Then you need to just stop playing the game. Clearly you can't ever be introspective about how YOU could have played better, it's always on your teammates and they're the only reason why you lose. Team-based games clearly aren't for you, go back to playing solos in Fortnite or something.
---
You should get this hanged in a museum!
---
i was gonna stay up but said fuck it. im glad i did
---
Boo
---
I timed my super perfectly to hit all three bombs on her and then some quick shots did it
---
How much trophies?
---
The ultimate auto-aim controller
---
I was using Rico always until I reached rank 19 where there is 3-4 dynamikes / barley. 
---
So when will Gene be out?
---
Probably a face that is similar to Nita‚Äôs 
---
It depends on the game mode
---
Yes 
---
Hi fellow brawlers! I was unaware of the Gene issue and opened my 64 boxes, my league reward 5 big boxes and bought 3 mega boxes from the shop epecting gene. I have all the brawlers so this was completely useless waste of my money and boxes. I would gladly appreciate a refund
---
Use it please
---
I got nothing, still happy though
---
Well tbh it's Supercell
---
Man, now if only Gene existed
---
You‚Äôre un-bear-lievable
---
Looks cool, he definatly needs a different star power though. 
---
Nice, I woke up and opened 175 boxes, turns out you guys disabled Gene so I got absolutely nothing in my boxes üòîüôÉ
---
How are you gonna compensate players? How do you know who wasted all of theyre boxes for nothing? Or the Lunar special offer?
---
Yeah but the one that walked away first would‚Äôve lost bc you wouldn‚Äôt get as much healing
---
This is exactly why I think the best way to compensate people is to let us buy new boxes using coins. That way what I said would still apply to people who got good stuff from their boxes. 
---
If they allow us, even just for a limited period of time, to buy brawl boxes for like 100-200 coins each it would be one of the best compensations for the problem regardless if you're maxed or not
---
Please make more!
---
#OREO, OREEEEO, OREO, OREEEEO
---
I know right
---
Mate have u seen gene play? Hes so trash dudr i stomped several with tara.
---
Gene super is only good thing bc he pulled back a primo in gem so that I can kill em
---
i checked the notice just to make sure before opening my boxes so actually that was a smart move on my part
---
Good idea, but the games may take a while to play out
---
Any news? Will the update likely come today or tomorrow?
---
They will probably give everyone 20 gems or something stupid lol
---
bUt tHatS nOt leOn ! !
---
Yeah I can imagine that
---
Tell me how they‚Äôre supposed to fix teaming exactly?
---
I did
---
Why is everyone in the background herobrine
---
We just want updates!!
---
Not surprised to see Supercell submitting a post called "Let's talk about Gene" and then not being responsive to their users.  
---
Kudos...Very classy Supercell!
---
I didn't get him yet so it's not a problem for me
---
None of that is relevant. If played well Crow is clearly not the worst character in the game. If played poorly then yeah you'll be useless. Brawl Stars is not a very complicated game, it's not like there's some dramatic difference between "tournament level" gameplay and casual gameplay like in League of Legends or something. 
---
It's an Easter egg, I think :D
---
5 minutes is too much when you have bad randoms in your squad D: laughed too much at this though xD take my orange pointy
---
U good
---
Genocide that puts a smile on my face.
---
I did pick them up later but this fight lasted for a couple of minutes so I couldn‚Äôt upload everything
---
You should definitely add a TLDR for people or you may see this skipped over a ton.
---
Cooool, so now you are supposed to be the first in the world with gene :)
---
25 gems?
---
Yep and everyone wanted to say hes op
---
They hated but now they got proved wrong ha bishes
---
This was really well written. I can relate to it because I am also an OG :)
---
make an offer of 6 of value with gene or give boxes or mega boxes for free please
---
More like: Brawl Stars adaptation
---
And calls can be missed too, if you have a broken phone or are in an area without service. There is a reason things like this are done by mail. It's YOUR responsibility to check your mail. What happens if you get mailed a notice that you received a camera-based traffic ticket, and you just don't check your mail? Do you just not pay it, and when they come knocking tell them they should have called instead of mailed? They sent out a notice. Just because it wasn't the type of notice you would personally be most likely to see, they still sent out a notice. There are a lot of people who don't have phones, in which case mail is the best way to reach them. What about all of them? What you're effectively saying is that they should give you exactly the notice you want exactly when you want it and exactly how you want it. That's just not how life is, sorry. 
---
Press the 3 dots at the top right of the screen and press flair
---
Hundreds of boxes opened and nothing. I think they are wrong. I have not seen a single "OMG I GOT GENE" posts like we saw with Leon
---
Beat me to it! Have my upvote
---
Alright, shooting against this wall will make the bullets bounce off to that other wall over there, and then- oh he moved
---
When is Gene coming back?
---
I opened a few hudnred boxes of all sorts... How do I get compensated? 
---
When you realised you broke the game
---
There is no faith that you do not see these bugs either. It is doubtful whether it will compensate those who wrote boxes or jewels to have jeans. I believe that you will not pay for it. Honestly, (Frankly now angry)
---
thanks for the advice. I‚Äôm a noob to making reddit posts, so thanks for the heads up!
---
Impressive you could read what i wrote lol
---
Autocorrect corrected so much shit from english to my btive language(Danish)
---
So youre just saying sorry then? No refunds for all the people that blew money on boxes?
---
I can‚Äôt find my gene anymore, I just gotten it after opening so much chest and now it‚Äôs gone. I no longer see it. Supercell, please help to fix this. I hope after the fix, gene will be back in my brawlers section. If not, I hope you could help me out!! Thanks!! 
---
So be it, rather have teammates that use bushes effectively than teammates who rush in with no clue on how to use the brawler
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure they are working their asses off right now. lol. Your username. 
---
Use the search "nintendo" on this subreddit, it's been posted a bunch of times and has huge support. I would be so pumped if this actually happened, it's an absolutely perfect game for the Switch.
---
That controller looks so badass... would purchase on day 0.
---
Did you? :O
---
I mean you could get him for free... your loss if you‚Äôre buying him 
---
I‚Äôll have you know it was that bad that I ended up tweeting about it on my toilet cubicle time. That‚Äôs my Brawl Stars time! totally unacceptable.
---
The same happened to me but I selected another brawler and now I gotta w8 till the update
---
He explained this in his post. 
---
Supercell: "Sorry, but we like money... and twitter notifications".
---
Morti
---
what he's referring to is the fact that you ended up getting Gene. So him getting removed had no impact on you.
---
Lucky..
---
They‚Äôre not gonna do anything 
---
https://twitter.com/BrawlStars/status/1096451358591455232
---
Haha yea crow is so fun, probably my third favorite 
---
lol
---
Well then u didnt oppen Any boxer after he was removed
---
It would be a new way to play Brawl Stars!
---
So gene was released? 
---
üòÇ
---
WhErE‚Äôs CoLt?
---
No...At the least, it's an intent on making themselves look better in response to their screw up.  
---
Time will tell if they actually have the intent to appropriately compensate.  I created an account because I don't use reddit otherwise and Supercell doesn't offer effective in-game options to communicate with them.  
---
I trusted that this post; "Let's talk about Gene," was an invitation from Supercell to communicate with them about Gene.  If you read the thread, you will notice that was a lie and Supercell isn't actually communicating with their community about Gene.  Or really anything...they are silent and effectively ignoring the conversation they asked us to have with them.
---
This post is a public relations stunt...not a genuine attempt to engage their community as the post leads you to believe.
---
That even possible?
---
Same dude... I thought gene wasnt coming back so bought some other stuff, im pissed..!
---
How can I have that brawler name in by name?
---
genecide\*
---
That's why we always find you in the garbage can üòÇ
---
This was my same logic but I'd didn't get anything either haha
---
I think they mean if you got Gene, they will compensate you for taking him away. Example: someone in my club got Gene before removal and was given 100 gems for compensation. 
---
I hate cavern churn they need to remove it
---
CoLt AnD PeNnY wIlL cOmE wItH 5v5
---
I opened 80 before I realized he wasn‚Äôt there
---
See I wasn‚Äôt sure what the compensation was referring to, so I figured I‚Äôd ask. 
---
1gen PRO
---
Please!
---
Your actually stupid if you think its one of the most f2p games ever made..
---
You have to go to the r/Brawlstars and it will take you to their home thing then press the 3 dots in the top right corner then push the change user flair and you can pick
---
Why on earth would you think that
---
Let's see what happens within the next 24h... fingers crossed
---
Choose the free box ;)
---
Good thing that you was prepared to use your super.
---
Good riddance
---
ok
---
I'm assuming it will be some form of gem compensation as I can't imagine them trying to take away everything people got from boxes they opened to refund the boxes.
---
Got him on my 7th box and got him to power lvl 3 lol not bad 
---
how much is the sale for you? 
---
Great input there üëç
---
Did you see my comment?
---
Smh I‚Äôm with you
---
100% whilst playing Brawl Stars...this guy charges.  
---
Nobody cares
---
Wow another beta player! Yeah i remember the duplicate brawlers( got crow twice XD) and I understand you 
---
I agree
---
I couldn‚Äôt even load the game to see if he was there in the first place.. my game was stuck at 0%
---
This game is only supercells best f2p.. It takes around 1.4 years to max your account, every bralwer added adds around a month.
---
Gene is back so don‚Äôt worry.
---
‚ÄúMy life‚Äù?? U no have life bro. 
---
She shoots flowers
---
well that's dumb
---
So that was a fucking lie.
---
Gene.
---
Would you say this toon would enjoy going into bushes?
---
Ahahah
---
If you know how to use his skills he would create havoc. I would also see it as a mythical!
---
Could you give me an estimate (in months) to max out my account in f2p?¬†
---
I log multiple times daily and spend all free resources (tokens) available+daily offer shop.¬†
---
I have all brawlers but Gene and Spike (opened 131 boxes today, nothing).¬†
---
My leg chance is 0.0288%.
---
Brawlers power :
---
-p10: 1
---
-p8: 2
---
-p7: 8
---
-p6: 8
---
-p5: 2
---
It doesn't change much, but I have 400 gold, 73 tickets (waiting for robo rumble max time) and 44 gems (I always buy 1000 token doubler).¬†
---
He had a blue background up until today, so I thought he would be a rare brawler.. nope, changed to mithic, I'll eventually get him several months down the line. Played me like a fiddle
---
Ok I was trying to comfort other players but you just want to show off what you know. Now let's talk about the bug. It shouldn't be a normal bug because dev team didn't find it before release. They also say that it happened on "Some devices" which means they didn't use those devices to test, otherwise they should've fixed it during internal testing. Perhaps they even don't have those devices. So at first they need to borrow some affected devices to reproduce the bug. How to get specific devices in midnight? And you just assume they have all logs they need in affected version. I don't think so. If they have, they shouldn't let bug happen in the first place. And most of the times, bugs are caused by inperfect teamworking. Multiple devs will be involved, it's not like one person check logs and find the reason
---
best way to spend gems: token doubler (or tickets if you're good enough)
---
The emotions the thoughts oooooofff. This is so relatable.
---
Lol.  3:25 in the morning...you go HAM.  
---
he is a team brawler. try him in gem grab and brawl ball for best results. 
---
&lt;3
---
Yea what did u expect from them??
---
Next brawler Alita! I want alita
---
 How will they pay compensation?
---
Fingers crosssed please supercell 
---
Plural for Mortis
---
I'm one of them. c:
---
How long did it take for ya to come up with that one
---
I started at global launch and have been somewhat opposite to this. My highest rarity is my mythic tara, and I have been able to get up to 4.7k trophies.  Also Primo is my least played and lowest trophy brawler. His attack is just so unsatisfying. 
---
Yeah I‚Äôm not proud of not getting sleep for Gene.
---
What a mad lad 
---
Mortises is better 
---
i don't know but most likely give an in game popup with items returned to your account. you will get whatever you spent. that's how it works in clash royale so it should be same here.
---
&gt;a bug cause by code
---
Ok supercell, getting technical I see?
---
Paying to unlock a brawler is hardly P2W but sure.
---
Except here‚Äôs the thing, he isn‚Äôt the only person that came up with the idea so that skin alone came up a lot on the subreddit. Does everyone who contributed get the skin, or the person with the most upvotes?
---
Good thing is that this does not happen everytime and supercell has apologised, rather giving terrible excuses like EA does. Fuck EA
---
I would save at the moment I just pulled Gene and he seems underwhelming.
---
Took about a year of just grinding, you‚Äôll get there and wish you had more coins for the remaining star powers
---
Supercell sucks
---
No one cares.
---
Hahaha.  By the time I logged in today he was already back so I was wondering why everyone here was going crazy.  /r/outoftheloop
---
Thanks
---
I got him too üòè 
---
How do you have maxed out characters at rank 12, my highest character is shelly at 7 power rank 12
---
Then how are you in it üëÄ
---
How did u get colt beside ur name?
---
**D****^(E)****W****^(ALT)**
---
*^(Guaranteed Tough.)* 
---
... Watch out there‚Äôs a Leon behind you üëÄ
---
I feel like barley is so weak now. His super is laughable at best now, bull/primo etc just casually walk through it. I dont know why the dmg stacking was a problem in the first place. it was a cool mechanic, other brawlers, like shelly, can one shot heavies aswell..
---
Yeah he should have been in the open so the dynamikes would kill him, smart 
---
I only saved a mega box cause i know i wont get him lol.
---
aw nuts
---
I love all the multiple layers of this meme. 
---
Woah... Wait. Is this one of your fake wizard tricks üëÄ
---
Oh wow auto aim 8 cube bull. You are so talented. 
---
You meant to talk to me? I spend money on Friday, as for OP, not sure.

Upvote this happens to me

Oh lol i meant to reply to the post as a whole sorry

I appreciate the love‚ù§Ô∏è dynamike main I assume?

Again... because I‚Äôm a bit dumb.
---
Gene &gt; any fricken skin

Thanks, I didn't know what to
---
Teach me üëÄ
---
Gene is a supporter, his super is good especially with a partner to kill whom you pull.
---
I can‚Äôt üëÄ
---
Nah but takes plenty more skill to play then an auto aim tank
---
thx üòä
---
He‚ÄôS ToO THiCc
---
Give this man a medal.
---
Great concept. But looks too much like a penis for Admin. 
---
So it takes more skill to spin and winüòÇ okay buddy I think you‚Äôre a little confused
---
I‚Äôm not sure, sorry:(
---
Read more closely...They didn't specify anything.  They gave a vague explanation of how they will respond to the problems they created when they failed to complete a basic testing operation.  They didn't address which problems they are compensating for...the door is open for them to honor what people paid them money for and completely ignore the people that worked hard to earn the chance to unlock, as well as subsequent xp for Gene from those boxes once unlocked.
---
Can you think of any way that they can reimburse hundreds or thousands or hundreds of thousands of users that have burned varying amounts and types of boxes?
---
Why not üëÄ
---
Don‚Äôt worry they‚Äôre compensating anyone who opened their boxes between 3:45am est to 11:45am est
---
This is sick!
---
Lol xD
---
500 trophies in one day. For me, it's impossible use gems to buy trophies, wtf...
---
It‚Äôs.. complicated üëÄ
---
Yeah as someone who plays a lot of Darryl, he‚Äôs really bad unless you use your super to get right on top of your enemy, and even then you kind of need to pray that you don‚Äôt die.
---
Sounds like brawl stars to me
---
Ok, thanks, I'll correct it.
---
I have not played this game in a year and I got this boi in my first box cool game very fun 
---
You should have bought him from the start and saved those boxes:(
---
Yes some guy made a comment, I will say on which post... Brb
---
.. What are you hiding üëÄ
---
no need to flex smh
---
Can u send me the link to the serenade poco concept? I don‚Äôt remember seeing it
---
Meanwhile 80 boxes 8 big boxes and 1 mega box gives me nothing 
---
Well at least you got crow :P r/CrowGang
---
Save them for what? I got spike out of one of the boxes too so it‚Äôs all good
---
Actually use the boxes for power points, so he can be leveled.
---
Anyone second this? I have the same doubt as OP
---
Ew, what?
---
..... The world will never know!! Muahahaha (does a Gene trick and disappears for 8 hours) üëÄ
---
I know how you feel. I opened 38 normal boxes and got Spike AND Crow (from different boxes).
---
Yeah on my account i opened 250 boxes while he was disabled lol
---
Haterswillsayitsfake
---
Good point but I could pull Gene in the very next box and that‚Äôs why I hesitate
---
Where? I didn't copy..
---
Send me to Mars with your fake wizard tricks üëÄ
---
ITS HIM
---
So you can max him
---
Lol what? Why would supercell do that, having ur skin in the game is more enough...
---
I dont watch videos of game previews, don't really enjoy em
---
But what can you use the coins for (assuming youve already collected star powers, you should be p far into the game and have not too much left to upgrade)
---
Grinding. Its not hard to get 150+ trophies in an hour if you‚Äôre really good at showdown.
---
That‚Äôs what my 30k gold is for why spend gems for something that I had a good chance of getting from the boxes???
---
I sent in a ticket a week ago with no response. I don‚Äôt expect them to do anything to help at this point
---
Hahahahahha
---
I opened some 20 boxes and 4 big boxes about a few minutes after gene was released. As i was opening them, i looked at the brawler select and he was gone, so all my boxes were wasted. Nice
---
Now that‚Äôs some luck 
---
not everyone has talent in playing games, some of them just wanna have fun. if you play with random players, you have to accept the fact that some of your teammates are not that good as your opponent. otherwise, just team up with someone you know who is good at the game
---
I'm against teaming and didn't say anything about it, you're the confused one kiddo
---
This ain‚Äôt Bob Ross.
---
I think I'd rather increase healing, 150 per second looks good.

---
 Haha well played man
---
You just suck.  You don't know who to fight or how or when. 
---
DontMessWithMyCrow
---
You said it takes more skill to play dynamike than bull or the other tanks. The only dynamikes I face at 470 trophies with bull is the ones that spin to win so I guess I don‚Äôt know how dynamikes at lower trophies playü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è you should enlighten me
---
It means that even if you opened boxes trying to get gene, you won't get compensated if you didn't have tara or mortis
---
He did
---
Next time I should put my user tag...
---
I just saw that
---
Did it fixed? Or did I waste my boxes? 
---
You just did an OOOOOOPSIE!
---
It has been fixed for a few hours now. 
---
Ok so I didn't "waste" my boxes Peuw
---
It doesn‚Äôt matter if you get first place, as long as you get 2nd or 3rd you‚Äôre going to be getting trophies faster than gem grab or bounty. Heist could go either way, I‚Äôve seen heist games over in 30 seconds. But since showdown is always in rotation it‚Äôs a fast way to rank up. I‚Äôve been using Mike, Pam and Barley to rank up on cavern because I can consistently get to 2nd or 3rd and I have earned 300 trophies across those 3 today.
---
Dude gene is good as hell, what are you on about. Maybe at lvl one he‚Äôs not but when u start upgrading him he‚Äôs really good for gem grab and bb.  If you play showdown all the time then ofc he‚Äôs gonna he weak.
---
Well I got them both out of regural boxes üòù

Lol üòÇ

But BUFARETE, why don't you upload this to youtube
---
Huh?
---
ok. ill try to improve it
---
Just missing spike and leon ƒ±'m taking compensation?
---
Why would anyone good play w someone whos bad and lost 100 trophies, just to lose trophies themselves.
---
Some say this right here is the face gene makes when you're at 50 HP and he got his super ready.  
---
Love the art!
---
IDK if someone post It before, but when I post It there isn't any post about this
---
I figured they would do gem compensation as the latter would be far too complicated to implement on an individual basis. Glad this issue will finally be off the forums and not spammed left and right like it has been all morning.
---
Omgg you ahve spike AND crow are you kidding? Im at 7k and no legendaries...
---
He said it heals it. Meaning it makes it go away. Right? RIGHT??
---
A good way to ensure you're not the only loser
---
The bot doesn't give a shit XD
---
Yes if ure casual lunar year pack is gonna help you a lot so get it before it ends.
---
You are insane it‚Äôs not just when he heals notice why nobody agrees with you
---
Being inspired by a skin is different from directly using their idea, so far they haven‚Äôt directly used someone‚Äôs skin they‚Äôve only used people‚Äôs ideas for skins
---
Holy shit it's niegil
---
Lol and im at 7k with no 500 brawlers
---
Don‚Äôt get compensated if you already have Tara or Mortis. 
---
japans are like super computers that esaclty calculate the route of the bullets and the enemies thats why they always win. And i cant even solve this: f(x)=-2x+4
---
Thanks bro ( ƒ± dont speak english "google translate powerüòÇ")
---
In there message it says so. If you opened boxes in this time period.
---
wow that‚Äôs really cool
---
Harvard wants to know your location 
---
you still could have gotten him but not played him
---
Boxes aren't guaranteed to have gems in them though so I'm not sure where the unfairness comes in. Rather bad luck I suppose for not pulling gems from boxes.
---
It‚Äôs not because the bulls or Shelly or anything like that.  If your playing piper at cavern churn then yeah you‚Äôll lose trophies. Play the best brawlers for that specific map and just get good.
---
Ur a noob his star power is very strong
---
Is that rule said by the developers or what?
---
Also I‚Äôm a veteran player, played a little after Leon got released but haven‚Äôt played in a while. I have been top 200 world, anyway does anyone have any good bands to join?
---
Unfortunately I did not get anything in my Boxes :(
---
16.2k isn‚Äôt a noob lol 
---
They don‚Äôt work even close to 24/7 lol. How often updates come out is sad
---
I started after global and I have 0 legendaries.
---
Yes, a perfectly unique and well balanced system. I‚Äôm simply asking we get something similar with Bull, cause right now he gets bodied by damn near everyone but Primo. 
---
Frank is a personal favorite brawler of mine, enjoy smashing people with the hammer haha 
---
You probably don't have all the Mythic Brawlers (other than Gene).  For some reason Supercell is not compensating the members of their community that trusted them to release Gene in working order.
---
This raises the question, "Did Supercell plan this?"  
---
It's unfortunate that Supercell built all this hype around Gene and caused their community to respond in a specific way and then choose to limit the hit to their bottom line with this "compensation" rather than do the right thing and take responsibility for the situation they created.
---
This is very suspicious AND greedy Supercell...Shame on you.
---
I got crow on my first normal box after update
---
what?
---
Cute!
---
Now make him disappear 
---
is that rule written by the developers?
---
If you miss some mythics you wont get compensated.
---
Omg congraz , I still haven‚Äôt got any yet . How many trophies do u hv
---
20 boxes isn't that many
---
Could you plz link the post. I didn‚Äôt see that they said they would give gems back.thx
---
Get a iPhone lol
---
His upgrades don‚Äôt change his mechanics and that is where the issue lies. He cannot work around most of the maps and his attack has a very small hit box. He will only fit in very specific team comps on specific maps. And his super is essentially useless if your opposing team doesn‚Äôt have a piper. Anyone can punish you and unless every person on the other team has no idea how to play, you‚Äôll live but have very little team contribution.
---
Why‚Äôd you post a blank paper?
---
2950. i stopped playing for awhile during the beta cause i didn‚Äôt like the portrait to landscape change
---
Looks about android to me
---
The thing wasn't in the gems in the boxes. It's about how how unfair is that some people get free stuff and some not.
---
works for me haha hope it happens. 
---
So the compensation is the Gene coming back?
---
Lol that's just lag 
---
Her new quote would be "Honey, honey, here comes mommy"! Nice art mate!
---
Omggg and supercell keeps giving good brawlers to new players this is so unfair I have 7000 trophies and no legendary or gene...
---
This is awesome!
---
For his Star Power I think it'd be cool to play off of the copy cat/mirror theme. Something like:
---
"Empathy/Reflect" - Ozun reflects [percentage] of all damage taken back to the attacker.
---
Or something along those lines. 
---
Harvard wants to know your location
---
So in terms of that, third party programs are allowed just in that specific game mode?
---
Lol üòÇ Thanks mate!
---

I guess they never miss huh

alright thanks :)

I did this to 1v5 but I supered in like a sav üòÅ
---
300+boxes 170gems
---
Well it sucks
---
Ps: I wasnt teaming, just got my super and spared his life, but he ended up beeing more ruthless then I thought
---
Why??? 
---
u/Koi-AK47 on post "Petition to bring back the old character descriptions"
---
I love it
---
Yeah that doesn't sound very imaginative or useful.
---
I saw a thread on here the other day that was jokingly saying that Piper and Bull's Star Powers should be switched. It's actually not a bad idea! Although no one really likes a bush camping Bull, and that would only encourage it. 
---
I get that you don't speak English but now noone'll undedstand yoz
---
How can you loose with Sans on your side?
---
Go to App Store &gt; Updates &gt; swipe down to refresh &gt; Update &gt; get Gene 
---
At least more visible lol
---
Her super charge speed is the dealiest thing about her. I took down a 12 power Frank in SD by doind a super + attack + super chain. He never stood a chance
---
Nice, hopefully I end up with some gems tomorrow morning.
---
His reload speed is fine, lmao. 
---
*H O W*
---
Ive been experiencing this  and they have never fixed this. Im with rogers in toronto canada
---
that's like what everybody used to say: it ain't much, but it's honest work. 
---
300 boxes and 10big one
---
Haha I‚Äôm subject to some of this. I played lots of el primo until I decided to give my attention to my other brawlers, my style of play changes and I never touched that rank 16 primo again. I never liked bull tho strange considering I used el primo a lot
---
Congrats, but it sucks to see this after opening 3 big boxes and 50 small boxes and getting nothing..
---
What
---
I found the editor on Play Store - I linked it in another comment
---
300 box and 10big
---
That‚Äôs hilarious. Yes that does fit the stereotype for bull and would totally cause him to become completely overpoweredüòÇ
---
Didnt get a single gem
---
Im just now realizing how many of the male characters in brawlstars have chops
---
Nice nice
---
Its not hard to get 500 trophies in a day, it takes less then 30 mins to get 100 trophies when you are below 300
---
I bought the lunar new year deal plus I opened 200 boxes only got 195 gems
---

---
War, war never changes
---
I thought you meant that this game is p2w which I disagree on
---
You would have already gotten compensation once you updated the app. 
---
It‚Äôs about 1 gem per box. 
---
Wth
---
Reddit crashed
---
Casual flex of legendaries 
---
Maybe I should say I am allready maxed for months and I got 80k coins. All they gave me is coins...
---
Yes. Tara is one of the weakest brawlers in the game in terms of stats, but her super is extremely devastating. She is best when played in brawl ball and gem grab, but is almost useless in heist. She should be played on maps with a moderate amount of walls and bushes, but too many walls and she won't be very helpful. In gem grab, she should be played defensively, and never as a gem carrier. If the opposing team has 10+ gems, try to find the player with the most gems and pull them in. Another good thing to keep in mind is *team coordination*. Seriously. Coordination is *everything*. Getting all of your team members together to gang up on one or two enemies is a great strategy, but only if you can pull it off. A lot of people also don't realize that you can break wall with her super, too. It will break walls but *not bushes*. This unique mechanic means you can use it on a wall (In front of a brawl ball goal, especially) and suck in enemies, get your team to take them out, then shoot the ball/collect the dropped gems. You mentioned poking, so I'll expand a little bit on that. Try to get an angle where you can hit multiple brawlers. You should do this whenever possible, because it can increase her super charge rate by up to 300%. For specific maps, basically any brawl ball map will work, and any gem grab map except Echo Chamber, Stone Fort or Hard Rock Mine. Hope this helped!
---
I care because teaming is aids
---
Dude it‚Äôs all luck chill
---
Yes, but the idea is great and it should stay in the game anyway.
---
Now just move it to the attack button and play Bull.
---
Give me your account 
---
Considering the compensation Koop83 received, Supercell is screwing over the few players they are compensating, too.
---
I feel bad for Koop83...Probably worked for most of the month to get those boxes because (s)he trusted Supercell and all they did was slap a big mushroom stamp on his/her face.
---
Supercell is a bunch of money-grubbing suits that could care less for their players.  It's funny to see the public stuff they do with the YouTubers that say nice things about them.  Supercell tries so hard to "look" good and then does something like this where they take a huge dump on most of their players.
---
I won't chill I might just stop playing this game
---
Why because your not getting a brawler?
---
Stop that, sir
---
\*insert alot of laughing emojis\*
---
How is this your first legy if it says 2/3
---
Username checks out completely 
---
I got Crow 
---
First legendary I got legit, I bought leon
---
Lex: Get my money
---
Oh he back.
---
That‚Äôs what pushes me to play more. Open more boxes so when I do get a new brawler I know my pushing is worth it
---
Because I wanna play crow since I started playing and people at 2k doing nothing got him but I'm pushing trophies to get mega boxes and find nothing in it
---
Don't cry, you still got my upvote. 
---
I also hate this map. Everytime I want to play this mode with a sniper this map comes. This map was in rotation 2 times now.
---
Oh...ok

Give my gems for box!!!!!!!

I have the exact same brawlers as you.

Hola tengo ideas para brawlers pero con una condicion que cuando los saquen que me los den ok? Max:max es un granjero que lanza su sombrero que cuando este llegue a su rango maximo el sombrero volvera su super lanza su sombrero alrededor de el,la star power es que cuando el sombrero vuelva este ira mas rapido haciendo mas da√±o y rompiendo el cesped.Bill:Bill es un ni√±o que tiene una resortera que lanza piedras con ella y cuando rebote se partira en varios pedazos pero haciendo menos da√±o,su super es que lanza una piedra grande que rebota en muchos pedazos al chocar,su star power es que por cada ves que un basico rebote deje su pedaso en el suelo y si pasas sobre ella te dara municion,mientras mas rebote menos municion te da.PD:Tengo mas ideas pero por dia les dare ok? espero que los metan y cumplan con la condicion.

We can only hope that we get some juicy content soon
---
But why? Are there so many boxes to be opened that they had to automate it? I don't get it. 
---
?
---
The problem is when, I never get new brawlers, they just want my money 
---
I‚Äôm in the same boat as you. My friend got Tara and Crow in his first 2 weeks of playing. I‚Äôve been playing since global and have Pam as my only epic. And then no mythics or legendary. But you don‚Äôt see me complaining like a little b****
---
I didnt save boxes because i dont even have all epics yet
---
News flash everyone is out to make money. It‚Äôs the way the world works
---
We are all different and react in different ways, I tend to overreact to anything, especiay this game that is driving me crazy 
---
how is it false information...i said in the title i didn‚Äôt believe them
---
I got Frank, yeet
---
Never have I seen something so relatable
---
Did y'all wim?
---
I love you
---
Clearly
---
I love you both
---
It works to but this matches the dam way the primo walks. Just walks right in and takes it
---
Yeah sure 
---
Sorry guys is "i draw leon"no "im drawned leon" sorry this error,im brazilian üáßüá∑
---
How about no
---
It was supposed to be something else and this feels like a place holder...
---
*mythic
---
Nice but his Star Power is trash. In solo it's literally useless. 
---
How will you use him in heist and bounty?
---
A THICC ASS BOI
---
OJ got it and pushed?!
---
Same... 
---
I dont get it
---
*OOF*
---
he might has mistaken u with other crow
---
Relax. I bought lunar pack after Gene's release but still didn't get Gene
---
Its confirmed that they will still having it
---
Your question wasn't translated correctly
---
  
---
Please ask in your native language.
---
Yep that‚Äôs Havoc alright (I know because I‚Äôm in the clan) tweet him GG
---
I mean if x amount of people play the game, statistically there will be new players pulling legendaries early or maybe even out of the first box they open. It is all probability do the best you can do is play daily to rack up boxes and trophy road rewards by pushing. I ended up buying both leon and crow because they were the last two I needed so when I got shop deals I took the opportunity. As for spike he was my first legendary at 9k trophies. Best you can do is play the odds for what they are or do what myself and others do which is save gems for multipliers or for brawler deals/skins.
---
It looks jUsT LiKe LeOn
---
Did you open boxes this morning. And no opened my boxes after 1pm
---
Maybe I‚Äôm just an idiot.. but how does every box have gene?
---
Thats nice
---
And i thought i was the only lucky one, i got gene and crow out of the same box today
---
Shes focused on the amount of supers shes about to deliver to the guy with 16 power ups.
---
I play more than 12 hours a day and open as much boxes I can
---
Next level of kawwai 
---
Same, but I have no mythicals or legendaries...
---
By inconvenience do u mean chests that were opened while gene was removed?
---
you don't get it
---
Yeah that's called exploitation lol
---
Tazminat verilince 1 kutu ka√ß elmasa e≈üitt olacak ?
---
Gl
---
Did.. you.. ?
---
It took me only 3 big boxes to get him
---
Wow really funny and obvious joke
---
Buy the offer then open your chests, exactly.
---
All I had left to max was crow. Now I have a maxed crow and a level 8 gene
---
Thx for the tutoriel. I should be able to unlock him now. 
---
The idea being that if you could unlock a mythic and you didn‚Äôt, you wouldn‚Äôt have gotten gene anyways. 
---
I didnt:( 
---
I opened over 50
---
Wow
---
Hilarious 
---
My phone crashes when I click so many boxes in a row
---
I mean you do what you want with your time but you dont have to play 12 hours to get all the keys per day. Honestly would recommend trying to play less per day to avoid the frustration because doing anything for that long is bound to be anger inducing especially if you string some losses.
---
That wat I thought look she spun and then u tried to kill him so she killed u
---
Yes, esaclty how it's done
---
Same! Now I look like a hungry dog ‚Äã‚Äãwatching a succulent roast chicken(GENE) :(
---
Don‚Äôt try to upload other people‚Äôs hard work it‚Äôs just rude
---
I almost never lose many trophies and if I do I get them back 
---
Yes! It'll be available for the whole weekend! :)
---
156 normal, 8 big boxes no gene :‚Äô(
---
I like it if it was more like ‚ÄùIncreases Attack Damage by 10% when being a copy of a Brawler‚Äù.
---
*SOMEONE IS GONNA HAVE A BAD TIME*
---
I think he should deploy a force field, I like the idea, the hook is cool in concept but useless in play, it requires cooperation by your team like you said. And that's hard to do without voice support.
---
I got Tara within 3 big boxes XD
---
Yeah but I used my box 9.30. I drop gene. Game crash. I open game. Gene "poff".My dream"puff"
---
r/crowgang 
---
Yes, I totally agree with you. 
---
I just feel like the game wanted me to win less, imagine being paired with a barley in gem grab that misses 80%ish of his shots while the other team plays not necessarily with high skills, I just try to carry but can't. 
---
Im getting paired a lot with those dudes who have 7 gems and walk to their death turning the game around, etc. 
---
But in all seriousness minutes after I posted this thread I felt like I was whining and should get better, so I agree with you. 
---
:V
---
Amazing. I‚Äôd buy this in an jnstant
---
Your Poco was better ;D
---
I like it! I would really like supercell to add a ghost like brawler to the game
---
joining 100 Boxes for days, and nothing
---
Where are the cringe guys who type something like "oMG hOw StuPiD caN YOu bE tHerEs alReAdy a GaME caLLeD brAwL stARs" and they have replies where is just some "r/woooosh or woooosh
---
It‚Äôs a refund for the gene thing
---
We do not know yet
---
Faker than my Leon's trophies
---
The lollipop in 3rd almost disappeared like Gene then came back
---
Sans:"happiness noises"
---
I did that all the time with fortnite lol
---
There should have been genes
---
Mortis is actually suprisingly good in Heist Maps with throwers. He doesn't do much damage to the safe, but he can push back throwers from attacking your safe.
---
They haven't told yet.
---
They said only that you will be compensated.
---
Nothing saying how much.
---
f(x) is what?
---
I opened 30 brawl boxes and 4 big boxes and my legendary chance didn't increase. Fuck you Supercell
---
Miss me with that. Crow crew sounds way better. He even says ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt mess with my crew‚Äù 
---
Thanks tho 
---
Band of Throwers 
---
Supercell started this thread and then ignored it....they are non-responsive.  They aren't actually compensating for the inconvenience.  They are only compensating players that already had all the Mythic Brawlers (which is probably mostly just people that paid to get them).  Even the few players they are compensating are getting a very small fraction of the value of the boxes they wasted when trusting Supercell to deliver on Gene.  
---
Supercell has completely screwed their players on this....Totally looks like they planned this to make money.
---
Took me 80 boxes but I received the one they call Gene. 
---
But when someone is searching they look for something like mortisgang or spike gang 
---
Opened 100 brawl boxes last night cause an hour earlier gene was there so I didnt bother checking... glad to hear that something is being done. Thank you
---
8 sec now
---
I got 5000 without super rates and legendaries lol
---
Which is why I‚Äôm trying to switch it up for us Crow dudes. Gangs are for squares.
---
It could be an idea
---
dynacide*
---
How did you make it, did you use some apps for that or no?
---
Ok y‚Äôall sorry for stating my opinion, I‚Äôll be more careful next time. First time on reddit lol just wanted to see if anyone thinks the same about Leon, since Supercell support bot directed me here. Apparently not. That‚Äôs cool, thanks for your comments! 
---
I face the same problem, i am 2k trophies and have only 1 epic which is piper, no mythic, no legendary whatsoever. And i see players with a very lower level and trophy count that already pulled out a legendary, and i am geowing sick of that. 
---
If SC has the power to disable gene.. can it work on other brawlers? Imagine a day without leon or  a showdown map without bull/primo
---
Why not
---
My account is maxed, can‚Äôt get anything but gold, gem and tickets (and missing points Gene in this case)
---
Nice!
---
The same to my brother, he got penny 
---
Legendary at 2k is too early, maybe 1 mythic would be fine. I got my first mythic at 5k, luck is stupid that's why I hate this system
---
That‚Äôs almost enough to buy Gene.
---
Dang 6.7k and all power 10 brawlers lucky you
---
If you take the chosen Super Brawler then it can not change in others!
---
I want it
---
You're just complaining like a 12 y/o.
---
From 7 matches we won ONE
---
Keep reading...Twitter will show you, too.  Supercell's response to this is a huge slap in the face.  
---
Unless you had all the Mythic Brawlers, you wasted your boxes.  Even if you did have all the Mythic Brawlers, you would only get a very small fraction of value of what you put into getting a shot at Gene.
---
Supercell is completely screwing over their players on this.  The response is so bad, that it looks like they planned the whole thing to make money.
---
Is this a record
---
That's a thing that a 12 year old would say. I don't want to argue.
---
He prob has max brawlers. Probably bought gene and opened boxes to give all pp to gene 
---
Same I didn‚Äôt get anything
---
It would be nice!
---
Thats my guess
---
He doesnt thats the thing... he doesn‚Äôt even have all the brawlers
---
Only Illustrator
---
Kind of?
---
But it's cool to play with dynamike!
---
HANDS OFF MY *down smash*
---
this is gold
---
Adobe illustrator? 
---
What.
---
or el primo
---
They‚Äôre meant to be dumplings lmao
---
why?
---
No supercell did the right thing, get over it. 
---
Tbh, it‚Äôs sort of your fault for not checking if he was there‚Ä¶
---
Oh shit, it does!
---
u/brawlstars, you shoud fix that
---
Leon: First time?
---
Sad;(
---
It would be a great idea!
---
He cried in the hallway XD
---
Me too!
---
I hate you
---
Same,but i have got frank
---
I opened  60 boxes 10 big boxes and didn't get a brawler
---
I don't have y not but I do for u should
---
Lol who thinks they deserve a new brawler after just 4 months wait... Don‚Äôt see this as something that was due, you just got really lucky üôÉ
---
Killing is the best form of denying heals. All I‚Äôm saying is Shelly, a common, outperforms Crow, a legendary, in every aspect.
---
-More pellets
---
-Faster recharge ult
---
-Stronger ult
---
-Opens boxes faster
---
-More health
---
-Same range
---
It's more satisfying
---
9 - 93 and nothing
---
It‚Äôs a glitch it‚Äôs been here for around 5months
---
If you‚Äôre meaning the compensation for boxes opened during the time Gene was disabled. I‚Äôm curious about the same. How many gems do you think a brawl box or big box should equal?
---
In my opinion, one big box should equal 30 gems and each brawl box equal 10 gems. Since that‚Äôs the exact gem price we have to pay for big boxes in the store. Then a big box is 3 brawl boxes which would make brawl boxes 1/3 of the gems. 
---
Highly doubt SuperCell would compensate that many though since some players like me saved hundreds of boxes. That‚Äôs a lot of gems! At 10 gems per brawl box, being reimbursed for 200 boxes would equal the exact amount for the $100 gem pack. Would be amazing of them to do but definitely not getting my hopes up for those amounts. 
---
We got about 1 gem per box so yeah
---
He thought you was the other crow
---
I reported you to donald Trump. 
---
Amphibian
---
How are your brawlers maxes at 6.7k? I have only 500 trophies less than you and all my brawlers are power 6. Do you spend a lot of money in game?
---
I get more replies from people that don't care about this, so...
---
Add what
---
500 boxes and opened him on the very last box üò≠
---
My friend had that too
---
Not a meme, just sharing. 
---
Biggest mobile game company my ass
---
legend
---
Because do it = memes. don't do it =no memes
---
Don‚Äôt knock him down just for trying
---
That‚Äôs why you don‚Äôt play with your food.
---
If disney buy supercell?
---
Sooooo satisfying
---
Do you honestly think your fucking funny.
---
everyone could lose a streak of trophies that doesnt mean that someone is instantly bad.
---
Thanks for your motivation. 
---
Bo super strong
---
I hate this peice of shit map. It takes the worse elements of most maps BUT combines them. Camping on this map is OP. Throwers and Rico are meta. 
---
Good for max dynamike and barely. But all the brawlers best for heist will destroy these walls
---
Why should you get something when you waited until he was in game?
---
The level of entitlement people have nowadays is insane.
---
No, you shouldn't get anything when you actually got informed.
---
LMAO! so good
---
Sans didn't have a hat.
---
How do you get a colored name?
---
How did your progress reset? All bets players accounts stayed the same 
---
It‚Äôs just luck no need to complain
---
I‚Äôm so sick of the trash on this sub. It‚Äôs like one post out of fifty is decent quality. 
---
Yeah it‚Äôs p2w
---
I love how every complaint I see is essentially a complaint that is due to the complainer being bad at the game.
---
cool but the legs are ugly
---
This is the real reason there should be an age limit on the internet, not porn.
---
His star power reveals your position to enemies
---
Big faxs couldn‚Äôt agree with u more
---
what a beautiful leon
---
What the fuck. Will I get them too?
---
She needs a nerf.
---
can‚Äôt do that. the christian moms would shut us down
---
16 boxes and I got Piper 
---
How? 
---
Only if you opened boxes during 3:40 am and 11:45 am EST
---
Not the navy
---
Yes! The offer will run through the weekend.
---
I didnt actually mean 24/7 dumbass lmao. They do their best with the small team that they have. If you wanna whine and cry go play apex legends or something else.
---
Wow great concept. I like it üòã
---
Couldn‚Äôt agree more! #p2w
---
Not the Navy!
---
Way ahead of you lol
---
The whole luck system only applies to legendaries, so it doesn't affect your chances of getting other brawlers. It can take a while to get a new brawler, but the game is pretty friendly to free to play players. It will happen eventually! 
---
Ah okay that makes sense.
---
They reset brawler levels
---
There is a cap to your probability, like how mythic cap is .2496
---
During the time gene came out?
---
I wasn‚Äôt informed actually, I saw that he wasn‚Äôt in the brawler page when I logged on, then I went on to Twitter. I am not entitled at all! If the people who were to lazy to make sure he was in the game get double rewards than everyone should get it for waiting for Gene. 
---
Extremely tuff 
---
This would be odd for piper.
---
I thought they fixed it lmao. Guess not.
---
Happy cake day
---
Guys, please ignore that pic on the right corner üòë
---
If you aim super and then get joystick to center then you will be able to not waste super.
---
Sorry for bad English
---
Thats better than genie anyways 
---
Simple; You just don‚Äôt buy gene.
---
Its bad but I went on a 12 game win streak with Brock so can‚Äôt complain
---
I updated my game three times in a row and it still says ‚Äú there is a new version please update ‚Äú . What‚Äôs the problem ?
---
Still dude, h  o  w
---
Falco! Where is Fox?
---
5k cups... 3/3 legendary... cries in 9k 
---
There are some really unlucky people who might stop playing or rage like I am doing because even if they are good and put effort in playing the don't receive sh**, while other players maybe new to the game just find leon and crow one box after another. It's like they're joking with you. 
---
Open 50 boxes to find gene and get leonüëå
---
Idk
---
And how does this make him better in solo? :/
---
YoU fucked up no free gems 
---
I know that feel...Stop!
---
I didn't get anything!
---
Damn, he should have made a pun out of that
---
Please do post it. I like seeing box openings
---
 Condom man 
---
Search for YouTube videos or reddit post. 
---
You \*bought Gene!!!!!!!!!!! xD
---
Ha. I didn't save any boxes. I almost have enough gems to buy him.
---
Could double the speed with adding another one of those
---
Nice Dumpling Darryl you got there
---
Because of the English take my upvote
---
So I checked here first and saw the recall - but honestly I should have opened up all of mine. I opened up 70 boxes after he was put back and didn't get him. I should have opened up all 70 during the period and got the same rewards plus 70 gems
---

---
What was that for? Was it about the Gene issue?
---
I did read it.  They are only compensating players that already had all the Mythic Brawlers (other than Gene).  Considering the short period of time since Global Launch and the low drop rate of Mythics, this means that the vast majority of players being "compensated" are those that have paid Supercell money.  Additionally, the "compensation" being issued is a very very very small fraction of the value of boxes that people wasted by trusting Supercell.  You can see this in Koop83's post that shows how few gems were received as compensation for the hrd work they wasted.  
---
This means that Supercell's response to this issue is their choice to screw over all players affected by the disaster; a very few only slightly less than the rest.
---
Teapot looks pissed as hell
---
Although I won't be able to upgrade him much.
---

So he is strong or not ?
---
I‚Äôll make sure to check it out sucks for them I got gene really early lol and you ? 
---
Lol... que gran invento 
---
He went to buy something with Leon at the store
---
Try solving 2x^2 - 6x + 8
---
maybe it will come? they could be rolling them out
---
He went to buy something at the stall
---
I really don't know could be
---
Oh, sorry about that. Didn't mean to accuse you of teaming.
---
I hope
---
Those Gemmers
---
No dude, he can be OP for you, but asking anybody else he's not invincible, just like Leon after Nerf, he's well balanced, not easy to kill obvious, but does not mean he has to become a useless character.
---
Lazyness to its finest
---
Haven‚Äôt gotten anything yet, and I opened 160+ boxes
---
I have one account at 7.6k and another at 3k and I only play at most 3 hours a day. Started at Global.
---
Question
---
I just got Gene from a box but they patched the glitch lol
---
WASD for movement, right click and drag anywhere on the screen to attack, space and drag for special.
---
3 gems only ??? Where is Supercell nowadays?
---
They are mad right now... 
---
&gt; *very mad*
---
Take my upvote
---
Hmmmm... sounds good aside from the fact that it‚Äôs BROKEN!
---
Feels bad man
---
Unlucky mateüò£üò™
---
This makes me happy, take my upvotes 
---
He actually decided to shop Gene for me lol 
---
Been almost two months now and nothing
---
I wonder what else he uses that machine for... 
---
I‚Äôm with you but this won‚Äôt make anything different it‚Äôs frustrated that they f*^% up and didn‚Äôt compensate all the players
---
He‚Äôs asking why do his feet look like crab claws
---
Actually that's why I said it but it works 
---
Haha thanks 
---
Thanks m8
---
It could be a good idea!
---
That's not my point. My point is that many jobs actually are being lost to machines/robots/technology 
---
hmm - i opened 5 boxes (cause read here first - but didn't want to miss out on compensation) and got 5 gems
---
Jokes on you, us Android nibbas got apps to do that in software without wearing out the screen
---
Only took me 3 boxes to get him
---
Nah it‚Äôs ok, I team sometimes 
---
I spent half on gene tho üò≠
---
Crow gang&gt;Morris gang
---
Just bullieve in yourself
---
I got Darryl, Tara, and mortis in a single day from normal boxes. Tokens and trophy road
---
This shows how much the finding system and percentages are bad
---
Power
---
That‚Äôs me! The One
---
I‚Äôm happy that I got my gene so I have no problem with supercell as it is right now. As I was saying goodluck my dude.
---
Sweet :) time to get crackin' on me crates!
---
Brock is Good. But Leon is really good too. More versatile than Gene
---
What type of end game content would you like to see?
---
The matchmaking is a shit when you have low trophies brawlers
---
Also shoutout to DRK for being able to deal with high level players even though he‚Äôs only 7k
---
I opened 7 boxes and i got 7 gems as compensation 
---
I opened 70 brawl boxes and 7 big boxes and got 2 gems
---
Thank you all for the votes. I stayed up until 2am Chicago time to capture it üëç I feel like less of a fool
---
I know

how can u tell?

Brock is God. But Leon is really good too. More versatile than Gene

Dope tho

they only gave you one??

This is actually a good idea! She'd shoot seeds tho

Thanks man!
---
I might be slighted by this (and all the other garbage Supercell imposes on their community), but it isn't lost on me that I'm the voice of many.  At least you escaped Supercell's sodomy campaign.
---
Relatable
---
That‚Äôs crazy, I‚Äôm still pretty new like I started playing when it first released in the us im at around 1470 cups and have yet to get a legendary
---
They got to cocky lmao 
---
Because getting something for nothing makes no sense. We all had to wait a couple weeks from the brawl talk to get gene, so what‚Äôs a couple more hours? Players who opened boxes are getting compensated because they actually lost something, you or anyone who waited didn‚Äôt and still had all of your boxes left to get gene.
---
For a second, I was happy about this because I thought Supercell was going to give me back all the boxes I had opened - 70ish brawl boxes and 7 big boxes. Instead, I only got 2 or 3 gems. Thanks, Supercell.
---
How to delete someone else‚Äôs post

You cannot. You have been cursed.

So the lag is affecting you guys too?!

ok fine

Ya I didn‚Äôt mean to type that much at first. It can be translated by screen shot or camera on a smartphone though. Thats how I translate anything 
---
Haha thanks
---
I feel bad for you, I got the gene after I just opened 54 normal boxes and a big box.
---
Thx and I wasted the 30 gems like an idiot without realizing if I spent them it'd be and extra 1.99 to afford gene so looks like I'm not doing that anymore
---
Lucifer gene

Let's make it a petition
