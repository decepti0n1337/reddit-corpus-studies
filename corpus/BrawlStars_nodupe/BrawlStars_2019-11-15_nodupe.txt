Got starplayer while afk

So, we are not talking about the 200 trophy Brock?

This is fine as long as we can toggle it off.

Happens to my friend with sandy
---
TEAMKAIROS
---
Thanks some people get mad when I miss spell but you where great
---
1. No. Flying fantasies is worse. Rock wall brawl is worse. The only teaming is throwers and the occasional bo with star powers.
---
2. Again, no. Throwers spamming auto aim will miss 100% of their shots. Throwers are easy af to dodge if you have a brain.
---
3. Again. No. Barley has the highest win rate above 600. Followed by Mike. Tick is 3rd. Rico is 4th. Bo is 5th. Shelly and bull aren‚Äôt even top 5.
---
4. Accurate 
---
5. Bo with circling eagle doesn‚Äôt hold a shotgun and often can very easily control mid
---
6. Spawn location has a huge impact on every showdown map. That‚Äôs not unique to cavern churn
---
7. Not really unless you control the middle. The outsides if you try to camp, you‚Äôll be forced out by a rico or thrower about 80% of the time.
---
if they drew the nipples they are gonna get a ripple
---
It good man I'm sorry for your effort.
---
No they arnt lmao, trap is a slur anyways.

I‚Äôve see you around a lot

Hi crow
---
üòÇ
---
This isn't even that impressive
---
I think he means why does it change color when he throws it?
---
Looks great
---
I'm in Seoul :(
---
Me too lol
---
Is Bruce the bear?
---
Yeah F in the chat i only finally get all brawlers yesterday after playing since day one beta release
---
No I didn't buy the gems. I saved them up, therefore I'm still f2p.
---
+respect
---
Yeah. But that‚Äôs what I liked most about it. It was almost exclusively high skill cap brawlers. And throwers weren‚Äôt teaming.
---
Why is Crow at the bottom?
---
EMZ
---
True
---
Graveyard shift is one of the best modes, as it discourages teaming, and allows for chip damage to actually be effective on more brawlers than crow, enabling a cool new sort of way to play the game. In my opinion, graveyard shift changes the way showdown works more than any other modifier, so I understand why it has to be its own mode, not just a modifier. Maybe put graveyard shift in a new rotation with whatever the next new gamemode is (if there is one) so that Heist and Bounty get a rotation, Takedown and Lone Star get a rotation, graveyard shift and ________ get their own rotation, it‚Äôll all be good.
---
He's beyond annoying, like god tier

He‚Äôs talking about how if you shoot a rocket, it still shows that there are 4 inside of the actual rocket launcher, not reload bar

He's smiling. That's unusual.

I changed my flair for this joke, so I thank you for your upvote frustrated stranger

I got crow on my mini account with 2000 
---
sorry for you :(
---
The fact that I almost have enough power points to level Tara up twice but the amount of coins I get is so sparse
---
Honestly, no original angles
---
Oh yeah! I have like 1000 points on most of my brawlers but no where near enough coins to level them, it's rather annoying

I want to say that attacks that correspond to what the skin is holding isn‚Äôt necessarily a custom effect. While Road Rage Carl has a custom effect with his super so it makes sense. but I‚Äôm obviously just spitballing here and am not 100% certain about this, mainly due that Spicy Mike says he has a custom effect but I don‚Äôt see where it is.

It was going to score without the Bo mines anyway

Squint, it‚Äôs sandy
---
I guess, I was just saying in case someone just wanted to correct me
---
Boi
---
The worst part is it‚Äôs just teaming throwers on the outside, shotgunners in mid, that one random starpower bo, and ricochets should can get good bounce shots even if they are not that skilled.

Also, 8-Bit‚Äôs SP is super game breaking. I died a few times because 8-Bit keeps respawning :(

Isn‚Äôt there a skin where 8-Bit is red?
---
Dude there weren‚Äôt Trophy Rewards when BS first came out. Nita, Colt, El Primo (if I remember correctly) were simply commons while Shelly was the starting brawler.
---
*most basic.. could have been done wit any other brawler lol

He said "and 8-bit" for continuation to "then explain sandy"

How do they both have star powers and he doesn‚Äôt

U missed the oppurtunity on making the one who transferred to bats mortis instead of emz :)

Oof why they make it so hard to give you brawlers like I'm at 8000 and I have NO mythics and only one legendary
---
Ahaha but look at that fire backpack man
---
Why QwQ
---
Lmao yeah. I have a friend who got a legendary at 500 :/
---
Next time shorten the f**king video

you earned a downvote from me

Really? That seems hard to believe. I have 1 legendary also but no mythics?

Ne asi
---
I think I had ti open at least 600~700 boxes to find Spike
---
How is this possible? If they didn‚Äôt kill any of you wouldn‚Äôt the total number of stars have to me a multiple of 2?
---
What about Darryl? Does he have a skin? No one seems to mention him, so...
---
I have the exact same legendaries, got them separately in boxes tho
---
Both? *Laughs in 30/30 brawlers*
---
No it's not lol the hammer will always stay
---
&gt;My legendary chance is .1661
---
I've been playing since global release and gotten over .1661 chance multiple times. Even after getting mythics and legendaries (as chance goes down upon receiving them). My guess is that you're simply not opening enough boxes to increase your chances. Spend everything you have/get on token doublers.
---
Am I too 30/30 brawlers to understand this 1/30 joke?
---
Wake the fu(k up Shelly is legendary don‚Äôt you know dat
---
Yeah, I just took my shot and everything aligned.
---
He does but you can't get it anymore because it was Chinese new year exclusive
---
Wow... I'm 6000 with two legendaries, got Leon when I was 4000, never realized how lucky I was...
---
DUUUUDDEEEEE I DONT HAVE ANY MYTHICAL BRAWLERS NEITHER JEEZZZ WHY ARE JUST TALKING ABOUT GOD DAMN LEGENDARIES
---
Well it looks like they are shite players
---
Gene might be a legendary in your heart
---
I mean new brawlers
---
I remember I use poco and keep killing by el primo and I didn‚Äôt know that shotgunner atually can deal lot of damage in closed range
---
Oh God, nor another Rule 34er
---
He use that meme template just without a credit
---
yo! thanks!
---
Imsorry is tjis some kind of normal people joke im too lucky to understand? I have 7k trophies and only brawlers i dont have are gene, crow and emz
---
Well played
---
F2p me laugs in 7k trophy almost every brawler
---
And report supercell
---
He‚Äôs only lvl 77 so he didn‚Äôt play much yet
---
Total trophy count doesn't entitle you to brawlers (unless it's from the trophy road of course).
---
You've only been playing for 3 months, meaning you simply haven't opened enough boxes.
---
You pushed 1200 trophies in a single week. That would net you roughly ~30 boxes. I pushed 1200 trophies over the course of 2 months, which netted me almost 8 times the amount of boxes. Which would give me a bigger chance at getting a legendary even though we pushed the same amount of trophies.
---
Just because your trophy count is high, doesn't necessarily mean you're more entitled than someone who pushes less trophies over a longer period of time.
---
Been playing since day 1 actually. I knew it was possible then but wasn‚Äôt aware it was now.
---
No, seriously lol.
---
If skins aren't needed, why should there even be a priority to skins then?
---
Bruh, again
---
So,........how my video
---
I dont think thats true try making a screen record video to prove it.
---
looks like Giorno to me
---
Kinda weird
---
...
---
I'm not being sarcastic bruh
---
It is funny but did you ask the artist‚Äôs permission to do this?

Who is he?

So you really knewed what means this text evwn without a comment?

#My eyes have never seen such thing before, looks creepy#
---
Emz:am i a joke to you?
---
nice
---
I see a lot of fan art for Rosa, the others are accurate
---
Oh God
---
Totally agree! They could also display the power level &amp; number of trophies before a match too, similar to how they do it at the end, maybe?
---
Awful.
---
My name is Bye, so before I leave a team I always say that Supercell put the exclamation mark in the wrong place

Could you atleast try to write one line of text without an error?

XDDD SO FRICKIN' FUNNY LMAOOO HAHAHA XDD YOUR BROTHER'S GONNA BE A COMEDIAN XDD
---
I am 4k trophies and I have no Carl, legendaries, mythic and epic except Frank
---
What is your level?
---
Yeah, system is pretty elegant as it is I think
---
well, and that people is the ones, who got all 30 brawlers :)
---
yea because its not permanent
---
‚Äúi don‚Äôt think you have any idea how good this meme is‚Äù 
---
Suicide rates increase as more people see posts that involve unlockig when the viewer has no legendaries.
---
(I'm deeply sorry)
---
Just use mortis or a thrower
---
I have 17.1k right now, xp level 149 and no legy
---
How the fuck is it even lower quality then the template
---
On Ryan‚Äôs Twitter.
---
Yes...
---
This isn't even funny considering the fact that 8 bit is only 3 months old
---
I see this as an absolute win
---
Why potatoes tho
---
pam is extremely under powered as well in the actual game i rlly feel sad for pam
---
I got all the mystic before epic when i was in 8k
---
Or maybe even nothing but just balance. It‚Äôs okay though as long as the Christmas update is big enough to blow me away.
---
the worst thing about this is that that thing happened to me
---
*cough* dyna jump *cough cough*
---
You mean power cube my fellow creature of the night

I hope they release an exclusive skin for 12.12. Maybe a skin that would be memorable for original players. That would be cool.

Repost

Batley is S rank brawler
---
How dare you COMPLAIN?!
---
It happened to me too! It was sooo bad!
---
First of all, I may have brent he bad player? Second of all the tick had 4000 trophies. Third of all the chances of getting star player while losing is so small, like incredibly small.
---
Yes it was
---
There shouldn‚Äôt....there‚Äôs still going to be a priority list between brawlers though on who should get them first.
---
Throwers FTW!
---
Surprised it ain‚Äôt all emz
---
Reeeee
---
Sosy jopy

I know they're allowed to make it real but they probably won't because they're not likely to take any outside ideas

Why dosen't make it 70000?

Yeah i had a dream where i opened Gold Mecha Crow and i didnt even have crow but when i went to play a match i had Leon
---
Oof just realized that
---
Havoc gaming the guy getting shot

Jokes on me, I decided to main crow and have both star powers for him, if only I could take that time and effort back and pick a better main...
---
Now i will Fail NNN

NO. If you are thinking about failing no nut november, don't. I believe in you. You must stand strong and push through. Think about how good you will feel on December 1st after you completed the challenge, think about how embarassing it will be when you tell your friends that you failed NNN.

Makes sense, I had like a period of time where I just kept getting more and more brawlers

Then an exclusive one

sound problem sorry

It's just the light

Maybe, But I Doubt It...

I‚Äôve been playing for maybe a year now ( I play like 1s everyday for a half hour or less) and I still don‚Äôt have any legendarys or mortis
---
thanks giving skins? maybe a sale on everything for blackfriday weekend
---
Well placed in what way?
---
I‚Äôm at 8.5k now and am missing just GeneüòÖ
---
Bull has a fair bit of fanart right?
---
OP shelly. Just give her glowing eyes and that's it
---
In Heist lmao. What are you going to do? Poke the safe with the shovel LOL
---
I have crow, but dodging constantly is impossible for me as the walk button is on the left side
---
im right handed.
---
Wow...
---
U play BS with this lag..?
---
Seriously, u have my respect (for your patience) :/
---
I have 10k and i only need crow,leon and sandy
---
I haven't gotten a brawler since Bibi was released. My legendary chance is .16%
---
I had a dream I got all 4 legendary‚Äôs, and I still have 2
---
The problem is that mortis was nerfed because he was OP in brawlball because of his reload speed. He needs a damage buff
---
Wait, that‚Äôs illegal.
---
1-map's name? 2-reduce the walls
---
I saw the sandy one first so this time I was prepared of something odd. I expected her to be buffed out too

if you look closer, you will see one, so don't worry, it's protected :)

Hi VicE

My friend Vladi will like this (he has Crow on both accounts)

I love to do that. I also have only done it once
---
Hi ViCe
---
good idea

Inlove how Minesweeper keep getting on the cancer thumbnails...
---
Lol really? And thanks smm!
---
whats so bad about crow? i dont have him yet
---
BeastSlayerHarun, I'm pretty sure that that wasn't an actual question. It's supposed to be like one of those, "You guys are getting \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_" memes. I understand your language, Pyoris ;-)
---
Open 18 more then you are 100% getting a star power (the percentage of star powers is 1% so 100 x 1 is 100 boxes)
---
Yea new color (hue) every day in the month of november
---
Oof xD
---
yeah it's satisfying to do
---
This is the life not the damage
---
Epic
---
Oke thx u
---
Do you know how close you have to be  to a bull for him to do that 2500 damage youre complaining about?
---
\*says in demonic voice\* DESTRU-  \*coughs\* excuse me 4 a sec \*coughs and says in normal voice\* DESTRUCTION!!!!!!!

what's your trophy level?

Yup, i have done same kind of stuff when i first started playing clash of clans in 2015 soon realized nothing is free everything is scam now whenever i see people doing same dumb shit i did

i was talking about the coins and stuff

OMG THe TrIiiIIIIIiiiP

Theruski43 10-20 gems
---
But supercell nit want this in Brawl stars
---
This is just a screenshot of the map : Cauliflower
---
It would be good if we can get something like this for 15k
---
Why
---
The shot bounces off the fence and fort left and not back
---
not really
---
"Code for legendary"
---
Same
---
Whats your highest trophy brawler (im not trying to insult or anything i just want to know what level you are playing this map on)
---
i received it as a gift

Tug
---
still aint maxed yet its lvl 8
---
Nad they stole a brawler concept for their profile pic in the clickbait title.
---
Yep XD
---
How?
---
bull has the shortest range of almost any brawler. Stay two blocks away from him and you‚Äôre good. Shelly has pistol range shotgun.
---
The opposite happened to me. I woke up, opened my free box from the daily bonus and got him

technically for shovel and punch, you have to reposition yourself properly, otherwise its not gonna be effective

Nostalgia...

lmao
---
Well Played 9.5/10
---
I dreamed that I got both of Leon‚Äôs star powers in regular boxes back to back. I was so happy, but then I woke myself up in the excitement. Feels a bad man
---
I comment in the video from the brawler concept but the kids from this channel think I have *STUPID* (yes they said that)
---
Idk
---
I think he meant yeast
---
at least he owned up to it
---
Billie
---
Thanks m8
---
Well no but actually Y E S N ' T
---
Not even close
---
Imagine tagging the person who stole the post
---
How were u able to chain supers like that üò≥
---
Well I‚Äôm just missing crow and sandy (I‚Äôm a f2p too)
---
Only weak peoples challenges in NNN, strong people can nut every time they want
---
I think it would make the game more balanced since you could be prepared for something crazy to happen, like if Mortis has Coiled Snake, so that you dont have to die once to figure out what he is using, i do love this concept tho
---
I actually tried Bibi on that map, doesn't do really well for me lol.
---
But I guess free token doublers are always nice.
---
Well non't but actually yesn't
---
Make el rey primo
---
One shot shelly be like
---
Really? Wow didnt know that.
---
Sounds like the noob is salty, once you actually get to play her you will realize she has a lot of drawbacks and is not as good as you think
---
Unfortunately they didn't, it was a quick knockout by nova
---
That's the point of not showing the star power it just shows he has a star power like currently in the game the brawler circle below the brawler has a star that indicates that the brawler has a star power but it doesn't show which star power he/she has.
---
I would put him to rare I think...I dont see him that often here.
---
Here in brazil this thing costs R$189,90
---
I guess
---
Supercell often says that in special deals to make people more compelled to buy it, KairosTime made a vid showing the value of each pack and how to calculate it
---
I dunno man seems kinda op to me
---
"Like Rosa"
---
Yah
---
I think that the super effect better only be on the first starpower.(srry if english is bad)
---
yes i made the original post and now instagram normies are getting likes without crediting me
---
The frank one would ruin frank he would become by far the most powerful brawler, and Shelly need absolutely zero damage buffs especially to super, and the mortis one will not help because vary rarely can he dash in get a hit and then dash away so it won‚Äôt do much damage, but still fun ideas
---
I agree, I don't know why everyone hated it
---
The star circle under the brawler has been there since before 2nd star powers were introduced, idk just have my upvote anyway lol
---
Imagine it take place on japan.
---
You should have a sandy flair
---
Thank goodness you didnt do the fake math
---
Thats fake, and they have confirmed next update will be small and there will not be a new brawler
---
Exactly, i hate that they started making $50 deals, at that point its not worth it at all, the most i would ever consider spending on a deal is $20
---
"I can't hit you with this shovel in my hands until I reload" someone should make a meme showing what he's actually doing while reloading haha
---
It‚Äôs such a bad game mode it feels like it‚Äôs all luck and I hate that
---
Yeet
---
I hope snowball dies
---
Why do you care
---
Yeah I know but that's all the point it's not supposed to show the star power and lets you guess the star power by the enemy's actions
---
Nice play, but making us watch 1:10 minute video for like 5 seconds of the play itself is a little ridiculous :)

Whwred u find this?can i have a link?

?

Bro as I said. I had 10 gems, countdown was on. Im supposed to run away and keep the 10 gems until it gets to 0 to win. You want me to be one of those dumbass primos, use their super and go at them ? ._.
---
Ur good
---
is it south or you know...
---
Im one of the people who do this, but not to the opponent. I join my bad random‚Äòs clan, and tell him what mistakes he made
---
Ikr his chanel is 100% clickbait and his comments are full of kids
---
Yes, she is a bit OP. They must decrease her dps 10-15% to balance it well.
---
That's actually not that bad of an idea.
---
No but I expect you to be better than majority of the people on the reddit page
---
Oh yeah, I will probably never give up coiled. I just want to mess with it a little. My Mortis is barely 700 because I only troll with coiled in showdown  üò≠ but I want to mess with it still a little. What I really want is Bibi's speed

You forgot to put the "this post was made by poco gang"

Ah yes, someone with brain

I need tara sp before they fix this

They are talking about the coins and mega boxes, you can only buy 2.8k coins and 2k x 3 = 12k. 150 gems approxiamently 170 gems which equals to $20 Total so far: $20. 12k coins equal to 2800 bought approxiamently 4 times, 2800 coins = 280 gems, nothing equals to 280 gems so lets time 80 by 3 which equals to 240 gems which is ~ 280 gems, which will be $15 now. Total so far: $35. 1 mega box costs 80 gems, 2 mega boxes cost 160 gems, 12 mega boxes cost 960 gems. 960 gems = $65. 
---
**Grand Total**: $100
---
This is my id whover ashes is he/she stole mine
---
Ive got the same
---
Super Cell trolls sometimes lol
---
It's a remodel not a brawler, plus it might not be the next upcoming update.
---
Nevermind the video looked to  similar I guess it was just a coincidence
---
GG, nice use of Last Blast
---
For all tose who keep saying it is Cavern Churn 2, You're right, i kind of inspired from it. Also I thought we needed more maps for Rico. Most of SD maps are wide open.
---
This discrimination must stop, i prefer top hat but taht doenst mean no hat is bad. Its just preference.
---
Dont take it seriously; another dinamike habitat
---
Lol
---
Because otehrwise, its not good. Even then Crows Carrion crow is just better amd more useful.
---
13,8k i need only sandy,crow,spike
---
My son got his first brawler to lvl9 and has been saving coins so he could buy his first star power. 4 days in and no star power in store. I have no intentions of buying a star power. [My store.](https://i.imgur.com/68905Ug.jpg)
---
nah he sleeping in the corner
---
OLJ ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
---
Can you draw bikini pam please
---
Don't fire him he needs the money
---
Then stop reasoning with yourself then problem solved
---
Starpower glitch... Uh
---
Global release
---
you have committed the
---
***a n g e t***
---
So all 4 of them are good
---
When did you get the first one??
---
Yeah crow is a toxic assassin. He has a lot of range and can deal a lot of damage over time and keep enemies from regenerating HP naturally. He also has a lot of movement speed and his super deals the most amount of damage in the game ( you can deal more than 10,000 damage with crows super, if you manage all the daggers to hit, which probably is only possible on big brawlers or the robo boss)
---
His super doesnt charge that fast but it is very strong and IMO crow is well balanced as of now. You can always escape any brawler at close range when your super is charged.
---
Leon is a stealth assassin, and with his super he can creep up to brawlers and kill them at close range because of his massive amount of damage. 
---
Then we have Mortis, a dashing assassin who has the best movement speed but fails at doing the most important thing in the game: brawling.
---
yep
---
#**RELOADING HAIR SPRAY**
---
Wdym this is literally the definition of beetlejuiceing
---
Maybe at 10k after opening so many boxes.
---
It‚Äôd be so much of a waste to buy a star power instead of leveling up other brawlers  I get the power usually within two weeks of getting a brawler to level 9
---
"Blet"
---
i had a dream that i unlocked leon then....... oh come on
---
His sp gets remaked dumbass
---
Nice
---
Beated three throwers with one,
---
*Bravo*
---
I think you have maxed brawlers
---
Imo every brawlers super should have a cooldown of at least 10-15 seconds. So annoying having to deal with shelly when she is just using her super as a normal attack
---
It‚Äôs a boy so the part in the middle is his chest not an extra jacket, but good at anyway
---
Pretty good Photoshop actually, I upvote
---
Right? Why do they leave
---
Man I don‚Äôt get what the hype is around sandy
---
I don‚Äôt get what the hype is with Crow
---
People have suggested this before you
---
Why three when you can do four?
---
It'a poco just so you know
---
The cockiness is depressing really. Im glad to only have ever been with 1 person like this, especially when hard carried
---
*w h a t t h e h e c k*
---
aw man. im at 12k and still haven't got that king Box
---
needs more walls
---
Xd
---
Also ain't nobody got time for that
---
The fact that El Rudo Primo translates to The Rude Cousin makes me not take him seriously, but this does make him more sinister-like
---
Love the details. Keep it up!
---
I swear I saw this guy in one of my games...
---
Still I'm broke so can't buy it.:);)
---
Ok boomer
---
She is at lower trophys range, in higher trophys literally any brawler can just come up to her and auto-aim
---
Well yes, but actually no
---
It's not worth even $1, because the coins aren't work shit unless something you need comes up
---
The gems aren't worth shit because there MIGHT be two skins worth it in that range
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
The Boxes aren't worth shit because nothing will drop.
---
maybe set your phone back to factory settings would increase fps, or close other apps that are running in background.
---
Me too, on my secondary account (3.7k trophies)
---
On my big account (10k trophies) i have 0.05%
---
This is probably the best pack supercell has offered.
---
big brain moment,but guys who have all 4 names have a bigger brain
---
Wow those bats really goes well with this skin, awesome work man, keep it up
---
F
---
EEL COSTOOO!!!
---
OoooOOOooooOOOOOOOOOOOFFFnice tho
---
Put frank in the last tbh
---
You cant tell by looking at the brawlers??
---
Yes but you just copied a drawing someone else made
---
You mean reloading stamina
---
Barley makes sense because in his original skin, he uses Molotov cocktails, which have to be somehow made
---
Wow! That‚Äôs crazy.
---
Cool idea but if they add this the skin will cost 300 gems.
---
14 000... I have only 5 star powers, and 3 brawlers power nine... and no legendary with 0.1359 change...(btw I can‚Äôt speak English good)
---
Supercell is retarded. They keep nerfing his super but his attack damage is just too good. They should decrease his damage at close range.
---
bruh you‚Äôll just get your gold back since pp=2 gold
---
Is very cool!
---
Thanks!
---
Dafuq, me too!!
---
I can post the proof
---
reloading feet
---
YOU HAVE 5K WINS AND ONLY 4K TROPHIES
---
So he wins 1 outta every 10 ten game
---
this idea has been done before
---
Happy cake day!!
---
Ok
---
More people than u think...
---
Better than spending money in to fortnite
---
I dont it's the other guy lol why you so triggered I have 15k
---
It counts his wins not the times hes played
---
Lol im not triggered im just saying it's fake
---
Yes, I played Dynamike on this map too, and beat a 10 power cube Bull
---
r/blursedbrawlstars
---
Literally how you have no evidence to proof its fake
---
It's always the same thing. Just 'bRiNg bACk rICOchEt' non-stop, and others have already created the picture. Why else is it tagged humour? But it's not, because it's just the same old Ricochet joke. Sick and tired of it. Think before you give orange arrows.
---
We have the same b-day! Also noice post!
---
Happy cake day!
---
Not bad tbh
---
r/shittybrawlstars really though, just why Poco looks like sans it doesn't means he's Sans
---
okay and
---
For piper better star power would be that she can search bushes when aiming
---
I thought the rule was there all the time, but mods weren‚Äôt strict enough
---
It‚Äôs not that I‚Äôm not comfortable to do it. It‚Äôs more that I‚Äôm uncomfortable posting it on a public post. I‚Äôd feel a bit more comfortable in a private chat
---
Are you blind or just stupid?
---
youve got this backwards lol, power points for coins is extremely useful. ive gotten 8-bit and poco to 10 just by using the shop for power points
---
Is Rosa up there with Primo?
---
Im im suprised that there is not joke about piper jumping with 7 stars in the enemy team
---
Nothing unusual about that.
---
Idk probably both point is watermarks ruined it
---
BS = Brawl Stars
---
Recently I‚Äôve been getting and playing against bad people. I played my colt, got an 11k teammate and some other guy with 100 total trophies. I don‚Äôt believe they were playing in a team
---
You get it
---
All these thumbnails give me cancer...
---
Always have always will
---
on the last starpower I mean if the tarantula attacks the enemy not if the original throw hits them
---
Calling yourself El Primo without jumping to enemy base with 10 gem
---
Maybe they want to play another brawler/game mode?
---
Mom pick me up I‚Äôm scared
---
If present he might be ultra legendary
---
Come at me Lukiebear!
---
Fair enough I just use him to get the ball and some trickshots with his dash attack
---
Bibi rosa emz tick are global brawlers while pam is in beta she has been here since the second major update
---
Its okay i think
---
I‚Äôm gonna backflip off my roof
---
Dude this is almost as sick as my dying grandma 10/10
---
Yeah, but the dash is really the only thing going for him. He can dribble fairly decently, but other brawlers can do it too.. El primo is excellent at dribbling, and can break down walls and is also fairly useful even when he doesn‚Äôt have the ball.
---
You mean close
---
My thoughts on my experience with Brawl Stars:
---
How I came into the game - friend introduced me (who stopped playing due to reasons below.) 
---
Who do I like playing - Brock, Dynamike, Rico, Primo, Tick, and Piper.
---
Best and worst - Tick rank 24, Carl rank 15. 
---
28/30 unlocked brawlers. 
---
 
---
THE BIG ISSUE. 
---
It is fair to say I have been in the game for as long as many of us playing around here, and I remember something about the Brawl Star devs saying something along the lines of "you better get a friend to progress and finish trophy road." or something like that. And I disliked it. I don't think at any point should it become a necessity to have friends to carry or support you for any game. And there's a lot of things I can say here.
---
I love Brawl Stars, except for one specific thing: the matchmaking. I have posted on this subreddit several instances of me being at around 400-500 trophies and getting paired with someone around 200 trophies. 
---
And the worst part is, this community thinks that "oh they're in a party" is a justifiable reason to allow this to happen. In extreme cases 8 have seen the enemy get paired with 50 trophies. At the range of 500+. Ridiculous.
---
What's the developer's excuse? "Get a friend."
---
What is worse is that there are times they're obviously NOT in a party and certainly cannot be me because I don't party. (When the low rank leaves but doesn't cause the other guy to instantly X, that's when they aren't in a party.)
---
I also have an entire folder of screenshots harboring all the times myself or the enemy team get paired unfairly.
---
If you ask me, a company as highly regarded as Supercell shouldn't allow such things to happen. I have my own theories as to why they do so but when trophies have this much meaning in this game, they should at least respect it to a degree.
---
There are many ways to resolve this issue. Some seem obvious to me, a person who has no grounds in Game Development. Like putting a threshold onto partying with trophy counts, cannot be too low or too high. Or having an option to go play with equal ranks, and can have higher stakes. Many many solutions and the Brawl Star team seems to deem this unnecessary.
---
Now that I have finished Trophy Road, I guess I will get all my brawlers to Rank 20, provided I can get the gold needed to upgrade them. And I really hope the fix this before I accomplish that.
---
My brother asked if this works...
---
Tldr Matchmaking trash and needs to be fixed badly. No excuses coming from Supercell.
---
i sometimes stay after loss for at least one more vistory after good run, even if i want to turn of the game just so the teammates dont think i left because we lost once
---
Good job!
---
Bruh, how many trophies do you have?
---
I once did 17 barley jumps. And with tick I‚Äôve done 23. Amateur.
---
nah thanks.
---
But then 6/6
