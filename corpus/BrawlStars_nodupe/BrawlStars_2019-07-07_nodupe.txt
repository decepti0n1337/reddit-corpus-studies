That means you are less than 4000 trophies. Once you hit that you can get tick. I got my first legend at 5.5k so keep holding out strong

It would look fine if she was still black and don‚Äôt forget a voice change

bro how to  see the game files???

Just change his name back to Ricochet... hes not some middle aged man named Rico saturated in some old musky cologne, hitting on girls half his age at some Miami club. He was an advanced cybernetic killing machine named Ricochet who specializes in Ricocheting what looks like balls of plasma off of everything around him...Oh and i like his new hat ü§†

Begging for upvotes? Really?

OP

My native language is Portuguese, not English, I just put my sentence in Google Translate
---
You gave brock‚Äôs star power to penny by using that glitch didnt you?
---
same actually. 320 is still 80 in my mind.
---
They made the team at the start of the game (8 remaining brawlers)
---
Either way, grow the fuck up. You took the time to put a suicide threat into google translate just because they killed you in a kids game!? Seriously?
---
It's too complicate 4 me but I can try to do v2 in the future
---
He changed his name to OJ officially though.
---
hahahahah
---
This is really good, but I think penny‚Äôs hands are a bit large
---
That's not stonks thats STOOOOOOOONKS
---
F
---
Most of the time you should just save coins to upgrade other brawler to lv 9. But if you really like Tara, play her a lot and love her star power, go for it!
---
Si lo hubieses hecho en ingles, los usuarios de Reddit (o la mayor√≠a) te entender√≠a y te dar√≠a upvotes
---
A threat? Obvious that it is not real, especially since they are extremely common names here in my country, I just got annoyed at what they did and that was my way of getting it out
---
Lol
---
So they should kill them selves. Seems like an appropriate response üôÑ
---
Friggen sick man i love it, brings a touch of old school final fantasy

Ok. I guess so. Publicly shaming people is definitely the way to go, but whatever helps you sleep at night.

Ok bye

I like this power but lose the wizard barley burn marks penny
---
I hope they dont nerf ricochet
---
About 7 weeks when all the second star powers are in the third ones will come

Add Clash Royale and I 100% Agree

Damn all my time spent getting my brawlers to 500 gone to waste that quickly

yOuRe eNgLiSh iS bRokEn. gtfo of here ü§£

Good idea
---
Ik rank 19 is hell
---
Cute

When you get a brawler to Rank 20 and immediately tilt them to 31 trophies
---
Nope not fake

Thank you

I think I‚Äôm ready to serve

Teamers are asleep.

This is the English sub...

Where did you get this template?

Cool

This one is gonna be real good. People are gonna underestimate r/Pocogang

Stay away from the action as much as possible. She does best at far ranges anyways

Sometimes this reddit can feel more like a circlejerk sub than the legit sub for the game

117674 is a highdamage for tara. im impressed

Its not called big brawler
---

---
Its big game btw

Big brawler was the old name

I see ur wrong

Wow gz that sounds hard and thanks

What the actual fuck.

No. Lenny went to Barley‚Äôs place too many times.

I‚Äôve opened at least 10 mega boxes and gotten nothing but coins and power points from all of them (a 10% chance for a legendary with my current chances)
---
Its a cafe set in the 80's - 90's
---
Aren‚Äôt we all randoms to someone though?üåù
---
No, I'm not. I'm OP.
---
Robo rumble is way more efficient for tickets btw
---
Clash suck
---
Since you hate randoms here are some thing you can do, you can add people as friend if you think they are good like you and if you have a friend  you can talk to them and if you want the ball you can say to your friend ‚Äúpass the ball to me‚Äù.
---
Oh boy, what flavor? (I'm sorry. The Tik Tok flashbacks kicked in)
---
I reached 400 so i just unlocked the replays...whats wrong with you?
---
Well, I'm a random who has to carry. It sucks so much and I'm sick and tires of these Randoms getting to benefit from me actually being good. 
---
The worst part is I'm HELPING them, these people that don't deserve to rank up.
---
Mr. Bat wants to play!
---
Oooof I'm sorry to hear that man :/
---
Yee
---
Didn't even bother drawing Mortis in his suit?
---
thx for watching bro, crow was in poison, he is goin to die anyway so propably dragin someone die before him is the best option
---
shelly x spike?
---
OUCH
---
I did but I found nothing good
---
Now thats some good advice!
---
I think instead we should be the big brawler consistently. So every 6 games, you get to be the big brawler.
---
That‚Äôs exactly what I do because I play Shelly. I don‚Äôt really do too much big game though
---
thx for watching, yeh, cant do it without bandaid
---
Some star powers are fucking broken and then there are these star powers.
---
thx for watching bro!
---
Its not meant for everybody to get. Its only for the best of the best players
---
thx for watching buddy!
---
Just got him to 500
---
I'm talking about the shortest possible time. If you last for 12 minutes as the boss the game just ends or so I've seen. That was when the game was vertical though I think.
---
Wait i dont get it pls help
---
Good job! Morris is actually the brawler I‚Äôm worst with. I have no star powers and the only brawler I have at 500 is a power 8 Shelly
---
N AN I ? !
---
you can be like me or even better! thx for watching bro!
---
Leon: Dad?
---
Shit, that‚Äôs all about that points.. You can buy cooler skins but idk, because of that the tokens of season are removed
---
thx for watching!! its kinda of broken, lol
---
thx for watching!
---
From rotation yes
---
 I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs possible to last 12 minutes anymore not realistically at least I think the posion would kill you by 8 minutes without being hit
---
I can confirm this is normal showdown
---
But yea I‚Äôve never seen under 30 seconds
---
/r/engrish
---
Explain what you mean please?
---
lol
---
True, but I was talking about best possible times so what is realistic isn't important.
---
Anyone know when the brown mecha bo skin gonna be in the shop
---
Star points are cool but should be a little easier to get when season ends
---
its a normal showdown bro, I got more games like this recorded. this is just 1 of them. thx for watching !
---
Bummer it doesn‚Äôt charge his super
---
thx for watching! yes, it is kind of op
---
What it is really good in maps where invisibility is bad like where there are a heck ton of bushes
---
As someone who doesn't have a brawler over rank 15, they're unnecessary but still decent.
---
Would be better if it was a PewDiePie meme.  The Zero Deaths jacket is PewDiePie merch.
---
thx for watching bro! no body wants to team with shelly, lol
---
Blasting all the obstacles to stop ONE attempt and then leaving a gaping hole for them to keep shooting at the rest of the match is never the right choice.
---
Amazing
---
Im hungry
---
But why he don't go to training cave?
---
I'm at 13.4 k and no Bibi neither gene
---
What
---
That profile pictureüòÇüòÇ
---
I feel like he was trying to kill the other bull and didn‚Äôt care lol
---
Boxing? Also Tara can already bully most short range brawlers in a lane without it so...
---
Way better than her current one imo.
---
His main attack has way too much range
---
nope he replied to a tweet saying he teams but then mentions he hates it
---
The **OLD** 500 system was when you would get +1 per win and -4 per loss and trophies would be capped at 500.
---
i remember that in heist i was using mortis for all the throwers, my team ended up all dying with our safe at 24% and the enemy team at 25%. I had my super last second and i aim my super and win us the game by 1%.
---
I think star points are a good idea. But many people are raging about the cease of end season rewards. Also how do I upvote?
---
Uh oh...
---
Boxing like 1v1ing. Nah it‚Äôs pretty considerable, especially considering it can block a whole shot from a shotgun character
---
yes.
---
^
---
Thanks!
---
I like star points as it gives me something else to pass my friends up with
---
Me: tries to use spike star power
---
Everyone else: Why is there a cactus in retropolis
---
I think they‚Äôre an interesting addition to the game but they‚Äôre quite difficult to get until late game but when you are able to obtain them then they‚Äôre fun to get new skins and such with
---
I was with another streamer (Ark) yesterday, this is exactly what he did too and on stream he said he doesn‚Äôt play showdown  (less than 100 wins on duo and solo on his profile) and mentions he‚Äôs just trying to show the skin off and see a reaction of the players seeing an unreleased skin
---
You have band aid so it's more like 2v6 :p
---
Brawler. Not hero
---
Gyro zeppeli, he teached him the spin technique and his perfect rotation
---
This is absolutely gorgeous! Good work. Those people that just give up should not even bother playing.
---
This is... annoyingly accurate.
---
Great idea, terrible execution. Looking forward to the changes supercell will make to really reward players for pushing their brawlers above 500 trophies.
---
after someone called him out on twitter he replied with this 
---
 ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to see me playing Showdown in many ways, especially since I treat the mode as ‚Äúfor fun‚Äù mode. I‚Äôll team, backstab, not team etc. I play with freedom. The reason I am highly against teaming is bc it‚Äôs unhealthy for the game. Especially now more than ever.‚Äù

Crows voice in the trailer was way better than we got it sounded like the grim reaper came for you soul

Ricardo said something like:
---
It would be Nice If se could see our brawlers trophy records when we select them.
---
Por acaso Ricardo, quase todos nesse subtopico falam ingl√™s para se comunicar, como um brasileiro eu te entendo perfeitamente, mas muitos outros n√£o.
---
I said:
---
Btw Ricardo, almost all this subreddit speaks english t√¥ comunicate, as a Brazillian i could understand you perfectly, but many others don't.
---
Just one more percent battery just one...
---
If Someone dare say they DID NOT try teaming once, I'm going to their house right now
---
I‚Äôm just gonna be quick and straightforward: starpoints is a good concept, but poorly managed.
---
Star points are a nice addition, but too hard to acquire and the best skins require far too many points.  One day I hope to acquire Light Bo; I'm not even sure how you get 50k points.
---
Darrel no voice
---
I vote leon for being an op brawler
---
Star points are pretty chill
---
STAR POINTS SUCK MORE THAN TICK!!!
---
This is made by me, not stolen.
---
You can still get outlaw colt quite quickly without rank 15s
---
It‚Äôs way too hard to get any so skin prices should go down
---
Hold up, instead of that, why cant his super just go through his teammates and onto whatever target it was aiming for and along the way still heal and wont affect the original pull
---
He should hold the trigger
---
They should actually make a voice for leon
---
Thanks! It's awesome to see you there!
---
Thanks, your designs are so cool!
---
No. I didn't saw this post.
---
Idk
---
I don't have that text
---
Star points is cool because you can buy new color palettes of different brawlers but having no tokens at the end of the season feel kinda sad
---
THIS IS NOT STOLEN! I NEVER SAW SIMILIAR POSTS!

This post was heavily inspired by u/Mr_J\- and his latest comic. Go check it out; it's just as sweet and funny!
---
Why does everyone do this... It's better to have checkpoints for all brawlers, instead of maxing certain ones out right away. For example, maybe if your brawlers are all rank 5 you should get all of them to rank 10. Then 15, and 20. Having goals like this is the good thing to do while gettting trophies in my opinion, because things are "Perfectly balanced as all things should be." (sorry i had to).

I meant im 8000 so i took leon to 500 first i got him on1850

You will see mecha skins only if you have Crow/Bo/Spike/Dynamike. If you haven't got one (2/3/all) of them, these skins will just disappear.

Okay sure

I don't really find this star power any useful, maybe only when holding gems or ball. sure u shouldn't attack if u want the heal too.. Im sure they were out of ideas  they just made this .. totally not unique.. leon has the potential for so many good star powers

Won't this hinder the progression of new players? Star Points is labelled as 'late game' content for a reason.

I visit there Fortnite sub often (don‚Äôt judge but I play it pretty often). Not much begging there as far as I see. Honestly, the average age of brawl stars players is lower than that of Fortnite players, since Fortnite players include not only kids, but also people who are in their 20s or 30s, while Brawl Stars mainly people are between 10-20. Unfortunate but true

Perhaps the person who buys the outlaw skin likes playing colt over crow or bo more. The reason I bought the Bo skin was because I played Bo more, and I also bought the colt skin as well, since imo, I like playin colt more than crow
---
It‚Äôs really a matter of preference
---
NO

I have been playing this game for 10 months. My XP:140

I think Panda Nita should cost star points but the limited skins should stay limited.

Crow

Who's Aqua?

It's a little bit cringe what i posted, but yeah...

I thought i am the only one

I know I can play it on my XBoneX but I see all these videos of different game modes and building stuff and... I played PUBG Mobile for months and thats the experience I understood. Fortnite seems way too confusing at this point lol

yes i saw that.. he says he‚Äôs against teaming and it‚Äôs bad for the game but also says he‚Äôll team for fun?? such a hypocrite
---
I have 4 max (3 star powerd) one can be maxed a rest are mostly sitting on lvl 7 with enough power points to lvl up to  8 and 1/3 to 9 .and i am missing all legendaryies. Soo its not about bad budgeting .

I rather have a cooler skin with higher prize.

Who ever plays BS with sounds üôÑ
---
Welp there go my star tokens
---
Yeah that‚Äôs true, the skill gap is huge at this point. New/relatively new players get crushed by people who started last year, which is the main reason why new user retention for Fortnite is pretty bad rn. It still has the numbers to back it up so it‚Äôs not dying anytime soon tho
---
;)
---
Yaaa.... So true
---
Means useless
---
Crafting table: am I a joke to you?
---
Everybody has their reasons
---
he wants so have fun because climbing up again is super easy
---
It has the best color contrast imo. It is not just the Blue, but the Red and the White and...
---
crow has the smallest hitbox and also has really fast movement speed
---
If he didn't send you you can just search "Lwarb beta" and go on Lwarb and download Lwarb beta (not lwarb classic that's old) also there just go to friendly game and select a brawler and go to another one select one of their star powers and equip it then go back and you should have their star power on the brawler you selected

Any idea how long their new game, Dauntless, has been out? Is it doing anywhere near as well?

Can u explain how to make the shadow
---
I honestly like these kinds of mini series "revolving" around colt and shelly.
---
Bet kairos is gonna use this as a picture for a community post on youtube
---
Because shelly is a girly name??
---
It's literally trash, you could atleast practice drawing or atleast photoshop it
---
Not unless your parents tell you to GET OVER HERE and explain what happened to their wallet ;)
---
Sooo Shelly breaks the game?
---
#hEy, ShOw SoMe ReSpEcT
---
I‚Äôm new to the game why does everyone hate teaming so much?
---
Do you even Shelly?
---
r/woooosh
---
Lmao
---
do you play only as spike?
---
Missing out on important sound cues that really help out in-game
---
Wait for the offer in the shop. Sometimes theres an offer to buy a legendary, thats how i got Leon.
---
Yes and if you look at her she is definitly female character
---
Go to the color palette and you see in the first row of the B column that column is to adjust brightness of the selected color
---
I just wish you could buy gems or gold with star points
---
2/10
---
On the left you can see the color changing brightness as you adjust. Is this helpful?
---
Actually they should increase the coins. About to 1000 ber reward. Any objections?
---
I'm close, 9000+ right now:)
---
Congratulations
---
Actually you have to manually draw the shadow using a darker version of the color
---
Soon 10k :)

You slice a person with an axe as night witch mortis

lucky that the colt and dyna were garbage
---
Ah
---
Its true, i saw the comment aswell
---
My app isn't working properly
---
No... But I'm sure they'll be willing to nerf him again
---
Nigerundayo Smokey!!!
---
I do, I‚Äôve unlocked every brawler except Leon
---
I was thinking ur also regening health so idk if it would work
---
I only get the 2 skins for bo and that's it. It's been like that for like 3 days now.
---
Dude i am unable to download this app
---
I guess the rocks really didn‚Äôt speak with you
---
Leon is the only brawler I don‚Äôt have. I guess I have awful luck
---
Ok lemme know when you upload
---
Bonjour Vision enl√®ve sa capuche est cr√©√© des onde avec le viseur de Shelly et son super c'est qui peut voir dans les buisson 3 secondes
---
not true but made me laugh
---
Spike is the new Leon
---
I did tho, it ain't that hard
---
I‚Äôm confuszled cause I had to switch my Apple ID from American to Canadian
---
Cmon he is spc
---
I love the idea,but supercell will put them for gems again...
---

---
*cries in brawl language*
---
Oh ok sorry for assuming

Wtf you are pretty bad at this game aren't you?

Quality shitpost

How about genderbent Leon?
---
And Ban teamers in Solo

You know I was thinking the same thing and I said to myself someone would made this idea

Oh looks who's back. Remember me? Want to tell you this again.

&gt;You just don‚Äôt know how to play the game if you‚Äôre not using auto aim on shotgunners. You should probably uninstall 
---
You should probably git gud and stop using the noob clutch because you can't aim. Uninstall the game, no one cares about this noob.
---
Its nit how the game is meant to be played, and if youre the omly one not teaming and youre against a team of 7 people say bye to winning m8
---
Spike was on enemy team mate
---
go to r/BrawlStars, the ‚Äò‚Äô . . . ‚Äò‚Äô in the superior right corner and use the user flai
---
Can‚Äôt be seen... or heard
---
Hm I don't see how it can ruin a game. What games have crossovers other than fighting games and gachas?
---
I know it took me awhile to get it
---
Yes, supercell answer in a AMA (Ask Me Anything) of brawl stars that this skins to be available in coming events, accompany of new skins for others brawlers.
---
I don't know, I think having the hunters to the left side is better.
---
Deogracio is not the one who made it
---
Nice.
---
Downvoted, at least it's 69 now.
---
As far as I remember, he has fallen severely at one point. I think it was after Carl got buffed and became ridiculous.
---
Honestly tho, Carl seemed to be a very strong counter to Spike which led him to fall back. What‚Äôs worse is that Crow got buffed and became a lot better. In fact, during the Carl meta, I‚Äôve seen some people went as far as saying Spike is the worst legendary brawler in the game. This however is debatable now considering Carl was nerfed

I‚Äôve never had it but I‚Äôve heard it‚Äôs out there in terms of taste. I‚Äôd want the first time to be quality eggs cuz it seems like if you try it with crappy eggs it would just ruin it for me. What does it compare to?

Amazing reference having in mind that the reference episode has aired yesterday. If I had gold, I'd give to you.

Go ahead and call the work of newcomers rubbish sofa experts;)

I‚Äôm at 507 trophies with my level 7 penny. I don‚Äôt even feel the need to upgrade it anymore lol
---
what does this have to do with brawl stars
---
The reason we complain about this shit is because there are so many shitposts saying "oOOo i gOT (brawler) tO 500!!!! iM soOO good!!". Nobody gives a fuck. Plus, we worked way harder to get high trophies, but now the people below will have it easier? Bullshit.
---
Please supercell

Not haved brawler.

thanks for help in betting 20 tickets (I was mortis)

I wish more people will be like you
---
Ya, but the Brawlstars subreddit is huge by itself. It's not that easy to pick out the original post especially since most results point towards large channels.
---
also if this one already done then im going ti be mad

Great tips for randoms!

also this is how i feel how supercell treats me.

Dude, I feel your pain

Yeah you should now put trust into your members before promoting them, and his ign wont do anything. There can be millions of people with the ign crusher

I have already seen this..

Looks extremely nice and I would definitely want this as a skin except like everyone else said, copyright is a real thing
---
Oh no
---
Btw guys just so you know if you wait 13 minutes 10 seconds in training cave, it will end. Then it will show this screen briefly and go back to the brawler you played in training cave.

I think he was more focused on the part ‚Äúhow is this funny? ‚Äú it kind of has a bad tone though through the context of the other question it changes it. Just a misunderstanding!

Very nice!

i just realized that was toothless after i saw your comment
---
I will lay another one so it goes to you! (it's a game with 3 players)
---
WAIT WHAT how do you track this do you use an app
---
Or is there a unknown function in brawl that I didn't know about?
---
It is, I don't see anything out of the ordinary
---
Yes, but then Im ded jnside after realising I chose Piper at close range
---
Yeah, anyway if you play straight 24h i dont think you can make more than 1000
---
Exxxactly
---
Is robo spike going to be released too?
---
Idk. Maybe im not SUPERCELL!
---
I hear this joke a lot

Barly just switched hands

It is said that a new Mortis skin usually comes in front of her. A lot of people seem to hate him

No, then there‚Äôs choosing Piper for Brawl Ball

Yes! Hahaha :)

I always mute supercell games, I have never played them with the sound on and you could playing the game with the volume out loud in the same room as me and I wouldn‚Äôt know.

Depends how high you want it. After about 11k tons of players don‚Äôt need gold in the insane amount supercell gives it to us on the trophy road. Around 8k-10k however I would have loved getting more coins
