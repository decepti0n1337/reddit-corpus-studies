This is the most beautiful skin that I have ever seen 
---
---
---
r/crowgang 
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure Supercell manages money for different games, not just combined. It makes sense seeing as they have different developer teams for different games, and I also don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs wise to just make a large investment like this just because of some complaints like this. They‚Äôre more likely to just remove event modifiers completely tbh.
---
I agree on the fingers, but yes, this could be a nice change!
---
Nice
---
It‚Äôs just an idea
---
What
---
Troll
---
No way
---
When old rico was badass
---
You‚Äôre*
---
Can you give up a T post of all 3 crows on r/crowgang please and how did you get that?
---
So many randoms having really bad Reputation. In fact, I think no one with only one account would have a good reputation
---
Second super might be complicated 
---

---
Maybe second sp 
---
Wtf lmao üòÇ
---
Yeah that last shot at the hiding shelly was random, I would have picked them if I didn‚Äôt kill her lol
---
Crow‚Äôs star power should be to have the poison stack
---
Triangle as barley
---
No it says new and a post from like 10 hours ago
---
 &gt;That's the thing, shelly is amazing early game
---
I hope you are talking about Gem Grab here because that is completely false on SD.
---
how many trophies does your crow have?
---
Thank you üòÑüòÑ
---
dude that was kinda obvius, standing still while spinning do not has much sense
---
[removed]
---
It‚Äôs honestly better than GEDIS. no hate but it‚Äôs pretty annoying and others need respect
---
What if someone is being a troll and downvotes all of their teammates even though they got carried?
---
Icy what you did there 
---
He reach 440plus, but now got tilt. His 405 now.

Good idea

Soy el mejoor!
---
Makes you a king bro 
---
What do you mean? This map has so many bushes  (for Spike of course.)
---
Yeah I just wanted to say this before Carl releases
---
This is an interesting idea! Any art work for this?
---
Relatable gem amount
---
OK thanksÔºÅ
---
*cough ... El Primo
---
Nice bulge
---
is this a joke that im not getting?
---
EXACTLY
---
but supercell showed a little Carl gameplay where they said that he can move while spinning 
---
Jeez fine I'll delete it
---
Bulls in bushes is fine because a bull would die instantly because of long rangers  if he runs around in the open.
---
To be fair the assumption was dumb, I just see a lot of high level players whine about one problem without realizing the hipocrasy of what their saying, anyways while I don‚Äôt see the damping of money flow your right, I am looking at one system but something making money doesn‚Äôt mean I think it‚Äôs fair, and many others agree.
---
An complete separate model for Crow that is used during his super animation.
---
Happy cake day
---
I‚Äôd buy this skin in a heartbeat it‚Äôs bad ass!
---
Flair checks out
---
Very skilled *laughs*
---
?
---
Yes you are correct. The encounter will end in a failure if you play primo by just trying to rush. However if you play primo smart you can dodge those projectiles and push in. Also towards the late game when the dividers in the middle are gone it becomes easier to play and maneuver around the projectiles. 
---
That‚Äôs actually the best concept I‚Äôve seen in this subreddit
---
clickbait

Oh so you're bringing anime into this? I see you surfing r/Animesuggest on psycho romance over there
---
Oh I agree with that. Shelly is a weak brawler against long range. But against tanks and mortis, shelly reks.
---
Your teammate has no clue
---
Deber√≠a ser caverna taciturna.
---
Why no Viking/touchdown bull
---
Maybe not bull because of his high health and high speed, but shelly has no way of closing the gao with no extra speed, low health,and no super that can assist in getting close to her target.
---
I was thinking about giving a +1 trophy for every kill you get, this would incentivese killing other players
---
Tbh was hoping for Mortis 
---
But in most cases, the middle is rather open.
---
Yeah, shelly can pretty much clear the map on her own
---
What if you could pull the IKE in siege in range of your IKE to make them battle each other lol
---
Awesome Skin!  
---
if you can find a way for me to get that skin in the game I‚Äôll give you like $20
---
I'm at 13k, and I think it is underpowered. Real Canadian and other pros above 15k agree that shelly is the second weakest brawler in the  game rn because of her low health, no added move speed, and inability to get close to targets. She's jist a sitting duck against most brawlers in the game.
---
Darryl is pleased by this
---
Haha ty! I hope this skin gets added too
---
r/woooosh right back at you
---
Wait
---
Carl has legs???
---
When I got the notification I thought the guy made another skin but it was actually a different guy
---
Notification? o.o
---
I never really thought of it that way. That makes sense. 
---
__Also you said you are the Star Brawler...__
---
I feel like it would over complicate the game if everyone had different options. 
---
5th place in solo showdown 
---
So close but yet so hard 
---
To get just 1 more trophy that is.
---
Does that mean crow is in love with leon?
---
I pulled the first image I saw online 
---
i also think that when you get, lets say, 300 trophies and rank up, when losing in that exact number (300 in this case), then you dont lose them, but if you get to win some and get to 324 (for example), and you lose 6 times, which lowering to -30, which would let you at 299, it would instead stop at 300, this way, you can get punished, but you wont get an extremely big lack of sense of progression
---
Wrist so icy wonder why she like me girl I‚Äôm drowning!
---
Its been almost 2 weeks since i stopped playing showdown altogether.
---
Look dopeü§Ø
---
How u do that
---
Up with rage.
---
All my 18 brawlers
---
&gt;18 brawlers
---
#F
---
I've been getting alot of horrible randoms that cost me the game lately.
---
Not with me unlimited data full speed connection phone *still lags* oh shi...
---
It's come to my attention the game has been updated once or twice after the article was written, and Siege got out, in which Jessie is just a freaking beast, I think that deserves an edit. Also, I do think Spike got a buff in the past, he just got sooo good. And yeah, Darryl's Star Power is a huge part of what makes him great. Leon Super was nerfed but I still think 8 seconds is a really long time, especially when you're losing and out of your mind.  
---
Oh, and it might just be me, I do love my Nita in Showdown. I love your Top 10, by the way. Thanks for sharing.
---
It‚Äôs ugly?
---
I like your new star power ideas the penny and Jessie one is the best
---
Hire. This. Man.
---
I like to call these maps Bush fest meaning too many bushes and nobody likes cavurn churn
---
See the problem here is that he‚Äôs absolute garbage
---
Tam pulling out straight ~~fire~~ ICE, congrats on being first of best brawl stars! Amazing work and keep it up! Sick ass icon for the clan btw

I was just thinking of other games in competitive situations where some maps are dominated by single characters which makes it less fun or unfair for people who don't have them or something like that.
---
Wonderful I‚Äôm not changing island invasion cuz nobody cares
---
No i can‚Äôt 
---
I'm sure that's what everybody wants to do, but reality can be a bitch and teamers kill you instead
---
Soryy taking a shower anyway no problem
---
His Super is actually pretty balanced, since it can be reset by Shelly, Tara, Bull, Frank, Bo, Primo, Piper, Darryl, Dyna, and Gene's super
---
Darryl, Dynamike SP
---
Like all the incorporations of her star power/super... great job üî•üî•
---
Actually I think the legend is OG who managed to hit 20k using *non-asian* matchmaking 
---
Leon is Greninja confirmed 
---
A paradise for penny

This skin is absolutely bananas!

Bulls always do stuff like that with their super I swear

how is this even relevant. ik ur gonna be like ‚Äúcause it‚Äôs unlucky,‚Äù but 
---
auto aim but the good footwork
---
Ik I commented this on this other post and it got 20 down votes ppl don‚Äôt understand 
---
how to turn the game into a 2v3
---
Amazing Job, I wish Supercell actually hires you!
---
Oh okay well what if they did something more like weaken the dominating character for a certain game mode such a making Dynamike do less damage or have a slower reload time?
---
I tilted pam what can i do 
---
Somehow still better than NWM.
---
That PIC‚Ä¢COLLAGE tho
---
Lol. Yeah
---
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs supposed to be a mirror I think it‚Äôs supposed to be ricochet trapped away or something. Ricochets hand is also smudged up against the glass which the creator wouldn‚Äôt do if it was a mirror
---
Hmm 
---
Actually it was me giving up on the game! The other Crow was one hit away from killing me so I was just accepting my death lol
---
Even with Google, very easy to screw up. And of course, you can only change ur name once.
---
Bro tell me about it. Cost me 60 trophies on mortis, and I'm a God with him in gem grab

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMN

Here‚Äôs a tip don‚Äôt play with randoms.

That would be cool

I still dont see enough of the monkeys lol

U underestimate crow. He doesn't

Yeah I agree, a little more damage up close would be nice

Nice! Make Ricochet next pls

Rip daryl

blessed_image
---
Ik I shouldnt but making an actual good team is hard and takes long. I just play randoms cause its quicker
---
a good idea
---
Damm, Brock got buffed
---
Yeah, your right it does take to long to form a team sometimes.
---
keep in mind this is an idea and i do forget darryl is a pirate robot so my bad again
---
Wow. That was incredible!
---
So cool
---
Yea lots of comparison ;-;
---
But thank you! Same with your outstanding skins üòÑüòÑ
---
Lol hi Tony!
---
I‚Äôm excited to see it!
---
Gedi is amazing but there are also a lot of artists with wonderful skins :)

I thot they would add life leach üò¢
---
Thank u! Gedi‚Äôs work is fantastic, both in quality and speed! :)
---
LOL
---
Long time man how‚Äôs the ice tribe? 
---
Well of course I understand this is an idea, and I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs a bad one (although ‚Äúlet‚Äôs get this party started‚Äù is already said by Poco), but maybe sprinkle some ‚ÄúAvast!‚Äù and ‚ÄúNot today, landlubber.‚Äù and you‚Äôre all set.
---
Green, Leon
---
I have 70 boxes, 9 big boxes and one mega and i'm opting for mortis
---
Add me nibba.
---
Lets brawl
---
Could you do this with the boss in boss fight, or the boss in robotics rumble? Also get a friend that has gene to do this in big game and get a perfect time when no one can shoot you.
---
to be honest i only use the robo brawlers and bull
---
Rip life leech the best mode
---
Aight nibba how we gonna add each other
---
Dm me

It‚Äôs üëç! We have three clubs now :)

How are you doin?

That is all A pose!üòéüëç

You mean thiccochet?
---
This so funny 
---
They're gonna do it. Like what they did with golden Rico and barley, they were just recolors too until they got remodeled.
---
I want to do that now 
---
Doing good, but I have no more content and pushing trophies is not enough to catch my attention back... 
---
So true dude every primo i play with in gem grab never fails to jump into the other team when its the gem carrier
---
Nah bro 
---
Epic win
---
So black face?
---
Neat
---
Pretty sure he auto aimed but that‚Äôs true
---
It‚Äôs because it‚Äôs sorted by power level
---
It's fake these were paid actor's
---
Looks greato
---
Ah, I see. Cool!
---
I remember that one guy who hit 19k when there was only 22 brawlers
---
lol no, it said +7 trophies at the end. it was genuine
---
I‚Äôm not sure what your point is. You‚Äôre saying the game requires little skill, yet you‚Äôre not even close to the point where the players are skilled.
---
I was being sarcastic (+_+)
---
i have 5.5k and no legendary ;(
---
They said the perfect image wasn‚Äôt real
---
I've seen some here and dont want to see more 
---
59 maybe
---
Very less probably..because he is a super rare
---
I‚Äôm missing Spike and Leon, and soon Carl. Wbu
---
Talking about the girls
---
Now that‚Äôs a Victory Royale
---
No problem. You are a great artist. Can u plzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz make Piper's skin whose name is Princess Piper. Please.
---
Angry robo 
---
Could you do one with Unravel?
---
Lmao u said that 5 times but thanks for your effort soldier 
---
Bro im just playing 2months after beta realese 14.9.2017 ...
---
What don‚Äôt you understand 
---
If that's true, I'll get him from the shop
---
Poco‚Äôs face though
---
if u think you can use Dynamike for all maps, then be my guest 
---
I'll start with the small then big ones, because I have a lot of brawler tokens which I want to use for new brawlers. Hoping I would get a legendary (I don't have one yet), or Gene
---
8 super and 46 normal. I just hope that drop a Spike, Leon, Gene or Pam too
---
Note to self, don‚Äôt try and joke with u/ducky284
---
That would be ideal, but I have brawler tokens which I'd have to collect first for the mega boxes, so I'd first try to get the brawler in small and big then if I get him will use the brawler tokens on the new bralwer
---
r/wooosh
---
Images to show chat discussion?
---
Har har, that joke sure made me cracked up
---
Repost from u/GEDI-KOR
---
Wonder if Carl will crash the game.
---
I would, but im not sure if it would fit the theme of brawl stars since Unravel has a sad-ish tone to it.
---
I had that everyday for one week in the holidays, was playing 6+ hours a day. You only get that when you play way too much.
---
I haven't seen attack on Titan but I recognized it straight away
---
You forgot the 10 spinning dynamike, other than that, nice job on the editing
---
Down here in the southeast-asia, the showdown match is full of them. It's really annoying. In my opinion, getting rid of showdown is the only way of "fixing" the gamemode. Or maybe make showdown playable on weekends and have some gamemodes to replace it.
---
Oh you didn‚Äôt gain any trophies ?
---
I thought it's a GEDI KOR skin....really nice job.
---
Instant buy.
---
Where did you find these files?
---
New gamemodes*
---
Only 3 big and 22 brawl, started saving a tad late but figured I should try anyhow haha 
---
This would be a cool darryl super rework 
---
That happens if you instantly close the game after winning without exiting.
---
Has happened to me many times
---
Sucks
---
Yeah that‚Äôs a good point
---
Worst gedi skin ever (still good)but it gained 4.5k
---
Opening the moment a new brawler comes, Carl I talk about you
---
Very cool but they can‚Äôt the said that  they have other priorities I think it‚Äôs too much work for them to just add som drawings to the game while working on other stuff üòÇüòÇüòÇ

Yes and we could see them when starting the match

Yeah title should say "look at what my 3d printer made" /s

ho much trophies you have had we u unlocked it

Nah nothing would happen as Carl is working in the dev accounts

Power 10 character at a trophy range less than 500+ not really impressive...

idk

But this is a friendly match there is no trophy gain.

Yeah sure!!

I'd appreciate that

I'll sort hy new when you post it then I'll tell ya when I find it
---
I had this with clash royale a while ago. That game is NOT nice to you if you're easily distracted
---
The correct way to spin is only after killing an enemy
---
I was around 1800
---
4-5 hours? beggining numbers i play around 8-10 hours and i still get good grades
---
What's the purpose of saving boxes?
---
I want to redo this tbhüòÇ
---
I can‚Äôt stand 3v3 modes. Cuz I hate when I make a mistake and hate it even more when someone else screws up. Only 44 3v3s and 899 showdown wins. Can‚Äôt wait till I hit the 1k mark :)
---
I hate heist!
---
thnks
---
just rank up lol
---
9 big boxes, 80 brawl boxes and 2 mega boxes
---
If it looks like a child it is a child, and you can't convince me otherwise
---
Cmon you could've scored 
---
I just give up if I lose 3 times with randoms because 1 star token is not worth tilting.
---
It‚Äôs pretty obvious your new to reddit and it‚Äôs not how this works around here. You either delete the post, it gets taken down, or delete the post. Stop being a dickhead.

I'm posting it right now

I‚Äôd really suggest it, lots of good info came to us.

It clearly says reach 400 *brawler* trophies

Amen

How did you get that ?

stop being a fucking asshole and just delete the post

Get your own content don‚Äôt leach of others and u know he lived right?

how tf do you not have to deal with atleast five toxic players teaming
---
Your brawler isnt at 400 trophies dude
---
That‚Äôs awesome 
---
just because your friend sent it to you doesn't mean you get to repost someone else' work
---
no, i though he meant it was a friendly game
---
Lol
---
Congratulations!
---
Well you can‚Äôt have a perfect 3 v 3 same brawlers only 3 brawlers can be the same on one side and 2 on the other. Because the last one that readys up can‚Äôt select a brawler
---
What people don't understand is how smart this is. There is a "robot" that tracks when you start playing brawl stars, and when you stop. It tracks how long you play, what you play and when you play. Using all this information it chooses the best time to flood you with messages, so it'll get your attention, and you'll want to play. It also changes when you change the time you play. You might think it just annoys you, but it brings you back to the game.
---
He is super rare so it‚Äôs gonna be simple to get it 
---
True 
---
9 big boxes and 197 brawl boxes...no mega boxes though!
---
Lol nice
---
Those people were so dumb, it was so obvious that the el primo would super if he had the chance
---
here's JONNY!!!
---
Omg Perfect! In Facebook Brazilian I saw many people talking bad of him because he did not have the hat and because he is blindfolded ... But I loved him very much! It was very beautiful, the color of her hair!

---
watch out! I think that poco-poco likes you
---
Yea ok I'll dig in the posts to find it
---
Hitting 3 enemies with the super then just supering 3 more times to kill them is probably the most üëå thing in brawl stars
---
All my friends who are just starting have near every brawler, I who have near 4000 trophies more than them don‚Äôt hawe a single brawler I want
---
I never tried, but there should be a -5 trophy thingy in the corner

---
Nahh you good
---
That‚Äôs such a good idea and I have been thinking about it aw well, but I don‚Äôt think you should know what they have , because in they you will know how to counter them which is a big reason why teaming exist because if you know what moves they have, then you would probably team with them, for example, dynamikes have moves that are hard to team with so that‚Äôs why they team a lot, but say one dynamike had a different moves, then they are not sure if they can trust him so it gets rid of teaming in a way. Also if would make it a higher skill cap kinda idk. Also plz get rid of auto aim supercell, makes everyone a lower skill cap and it‚Äôs not fun
---
If only Darryl shot lasers instead of shotgun shells...

Credits to u/HookaCola finally found em

Could have atleast given some credit to creator
---
Skin looks awesome in game. And funny out of game, life the skin.
---
Just did
---
Yes, fanmade brawlers can, and probably will be added into the game. Every fanmade brawler will be altered, but the concept still stands. Gene and Carl both have fanmade parts in them. The thing with your brawl is, it's a drawing. It's a good drawing, but it's just a drawing. There's no concept, no attack, super, starpower etc.
---
I couldn't find em cause its a pic I saved months ago
---
But if it does not freeze, it doesn't make any freaking sense

How many gems do you think will he could cost at release?

That is pain
---
Kill one enemy, now it's 3v1
---
I collcted my boxes now cuz i need coins
---
Ok.. np 
---
üòÇ I love this! Extra points for Spongebob meme.
---
What are you trying to say?
---
None im just hoping my luck would work like with every super rare...
---
That's really unimpressive, yes. All my brawlers are 5-7 and around 300?
---
Actually he is a super rare rarity
---
After the Gene fiasco, I'm waiting till midday to open my boxes just in case.
---
It‚Äôs been posted before
---
He looks like the Pokemon punkaboo 
---
I like em big
---
Her handgun and two bombs. 
---
Hmmm
---
What can i do next?
---
I'm the same, but with Brawl Ball. Hate that game mode
---
Hope so... 
---
He could use more health, and his poison should deal more damage than just 72 around base level, when his feathers do 300 or something damage. Buff it to at least 1/3 of the base damage. Idk how crow is at higher levels, I‚Äôve only seen him at level 1 and 2. If the poison does decent damage at higher levels, have it stack so that each feather has its own poison ticks instead of just extending the other ones, like Barley‚Äôs fire.
---
How much do u think to buy him using gems? 
---
Sorry for my english.üòá
---
Bad bot
---
I am too üòâ
---
Never gonna happen 
---
We still won the game don‚Äôt worry lol
---
Looks like someone didn‚Äôt see the AMA
---
This is so me
---
We was messing around, I clutched up in then end anyway. Playing with a 730 rico aswell
---
This is from the new Robin Hood correct
---
Lol wasn‚Äôt expecting that
---
Haha, I find it funny how everyone thinks we‚Äôre noobs yet all playing 700+ we were just having fun lol
---
Sounds interesting, or maybe add more daggers instead of three? 
---
Wdym all I see is three Darryl‚Äôs teaming in showdown
---
No? It's pretty active.
---
F
---
I don't think its dying its a good game
---
Definitely a gemmer
---
Least dense areas means it spawns more for the loners like spike
---
Oh ok
---
Nope
---
I have 160 brawl boxes, 5 big and 1 mega :)
---
K
---
Is this supposed to continue forever?
---
This is the one in 14,000,605 universes that you win this match.
---
A you tuber
---
not a glitch you have been banned from showdown for teaming.
---
You know that's funny ? IT COULD BE A REALLY GOOD MAP
---
I don't play her well..... If I got her star power then it will be amazing to use her
---
Shelly is so tilted 
---
This was already posted so many times 2 weeks ago. And yes its all fake. Frank from supercell approved to this 
---
No
---
Well yes, but actually no.
---
Great concept! Loved the animation too. Maybe for the super he could just throw a bunch of bananas like barley's super? His super now would be too op I think.
---
It's not a joke I thought it was real I just couldn't find a better flair. But I found out it's fake.
---
ah I see
---
was wondering where this came from
---
Clash royale in Brawl Stars :D
---
You calculate the chance of not getting Carl in one box. You multiply that chance as many times as the number of pulls that you're gonna do (if chance of not getting heads  in one coin toss is 0.5, then the chance of getting no heads in 2 coin tosses is 0.5√ó 0.5 and similarly for 5 coin tosses is 0.5√ó0.5√ó0.5√ó0.5√ó0.5 or simply 0.5^5) and then you subtract your result by 1. So, if you had 10 boxes and the  chance of getting Carl is 0.012096 making the chance of not getting him =1-(0.012096) which is 0.987904 then the chance of not getting him in 10 boxes is 0.987904√ó0.987904√ó...10 times or simply 0.987904^10 viz ~0.8854 which translates to about 88.5% 
---
TL;DR : chance of getting Carl = 1 - [(0.987904)^(number of boxes)]
---
Where for each brawl box is counted as having 1 box, each big box as 3 and each mega box as 10.
---
More interested than dumb this is 700+ trophey gameplay so I would be careful saying dumb
---
I want in.
---
Normal attack:shoots a long range ice beam power 1 dmg = 800
---
This is amazing 
---
Teaming needs to be fixed however there isn‚Äôt an easy option. Rewarding kills would be a solution, however it would completely change the mode. I just hate how you can play really well, but a bush camper will always win. Showdown is a mode people like because you don‚Äôt have to rely on teammates however it‚Äôs much easier to win. Showdown doesn‚Äôt reward skill, it rewards camping imo
---
Yea
---
I think no. It's impossible to predict that good
---
You know, he‚Äôs had enough of all the teaming
---
That is an interesting idea for gem grab. I would like to see that as well. Thanks for reading! :)
---
good idea
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Yes, but you got it at 10:07 though.
---
Make it more clear i can't understand 
---
Congratulations on your sobriety! Stay strong.

Plz give me an idea!

Repost/low quality 
---
Am I supposed to comment this?
---
Actually mushrooms don't appear where there is pack of people to prevent teaming.
---
But a bit of luck since there was a lone el primo on the upper left. Good one though.
---
Well yes but actually no
---
I‚Äôm just saying it‚Äôs weird because usually with any other brawler there would be a wall animation of the wall... cracking I guess 
---
On this note take a look at this....
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/b3rnd3/that_invincibility_is_op/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
People still play Minecraft?? Anyways, this is great.
---
But you aren't supposed to comment this
---
BM always bites.
---
I know I just thought it was weird that there wasn‚Äôt a wall animation and mortis isn‚Äôt even using his shovel
---
It was my home. And it was beautiful.
---
Yeah, in the older versions of the game, there wasn‚Äôt a trophy road. You therefore unlocked all brawlers from boxes. That‚Äôs what happened here, he got his brawlers before the trophy road system was included.
---
Do you use a bot
---
my friends are at 1300 trohies with spike and all super rare and frank
---
Thank You Brawl Stars for Gene !
---
No... not everything revolves around Americans 
---
Really
---
i don have gems for this  ;C
---
REPORT
---
Well no
---
Hehe
---
*Calculated*
---
Ha i broke your streak
---
We should like... trade accounts.
---
If you flip a coin you have a 50% chance of getting a heads. If you flip it twice do you have a 100% chance of getting a heads? 
---
Rip the dream
---
Cake day man 
---
Lol I downloaded the game like 2min after it released in beta
---
That‚Äôs weird. I pulled Gene yesterday and my legendary chance is still over twice that. 
---
why yall bullying me and downvoting my comment. im dumb i get it. now go on with your day
---
Yeah hopefully I'm all set.
---
Yes I totally planned this
---
I‚Äôm surprised that post-beta players could get 6 characters. 
---
But 6 and below is still pretty rare anyways.
---
She would be way too strong with a buff. Her attack is nice in that it goes through characters/boxes and her super is one of the best in the game. 
---
God please put a pumpkin hat on that thing
---
Now I can get more trophies since no one invites me to play lmao 
---
Si üòâ
---
have all just missing leon and gene 
---
Repost scumbag
---
That's an interesting suggestion to make them not be used for trolling and things, and just show instead of the default ones. They would probably be different for every brawler then
---
That would be a broken buff that would render any healer useless for ALL the match.
---
Let the developers do the balancing instead of saying useless things please 
---
I am missing Gene and all the legendaries.üò≠üò≠üò≠
---
I almost spit out my yak ü§£
---
Np, and no, I went through it in my head.
---
Well then gl
---
Everyone, I would make it legendary instead of rare, but that's the meme format. I will not disobey the meme (format).
---
he says it‚Äôs new but the picture was taken from an android phone
---
nice pixels 
---
This isn‚Äôt a cover tho it‚Äôs a remix 
---
No. Nothing more annoying than a poco spanning 3 attacks going in circles and spanning again
---
Rarity isn‚Äôt determined by how ‚Äúgood‚Äù a brawler is. It‚Äôs mostly from how unique one is to others, similar to Clash Royale legendaries.
---
This deserves many more upvotes, making a 5 minute cover of the brawl stars intro on Minecraft probably took you hours. Thanks for your hard work and dedication!
---
Sorry, wrong communityüòÑ
---
No tara or mortis or gene.
---
gl üòé
---
Why do you go on other people‚Äôs posts and talk shit. What does that get you? You told this poster to get off Reddit. What did he do to make you say that? 
---
Coins, more COINS
---
The whole presentation had me laughing my ass off..
---
I think his hammer should also be facing upwards to look perfect.
---
Hah! Got him on 1 box after not playing for a week ll
---
oof
---
I find Bounty x100 worse
---
Poco isn‚Äôt bad he‚Äôs actually really good 
---
I pulled a star power 3-4 days ago so it might have something to do with that 
---
YesüôÉ
---
I think spike needs  a little nerf and the rarity doesn't always depend on how Good a brawler is so this will never happen.
---
Good Luck!
---
Ok so I bought Crow (ik, p2w pls no hate) and I'm actually really liking him.
---
I'm not a pro or anything, it did take a while to get OK with him but I really like the different tactics required to really use him.
---
I just hit rank 14 while still only power level 2, which I'm pretty sure is a lot farther than I've ever gotten any other brawlers at that level.
---
He could definitely use some more health, but if you're getting hit you're kinda doing it wrong anyway, am I right? 
---
Me with no boxes saved up: Not hype, not hype, not hype, not hype.
---
agreed. but im fine with mine for now.
---
:)
---
Ik
---
Grandayy? Is this you lord?
---
U wont beleive i got 2 mythics and 1 legendary in 2 weeks. From normal brawl box
---
Like they did in the whole last weak
---
Best Idea Ever!!!
---
(O T O)
---
Lol true
---
Probably not poco super, but gene, Pam, Barley, and poco star power as well as the healing station.
---
Lol, I got three people to waste their supers in a row with the ball. Kicked it at a guy who was about to super, he kicked it back, I kicked it to his buddy, they blew the super to go for the goal, I got it, then kicked it away and supered the last guy as Shelly to animation cancel it.
---
Who said that a soccerball can't win in a gunfight?
---
Disagree.i have shelly ready for level 9 that has this upgrade symbol different from other brawlers that can be upgraded upto 6 or 7.can show you the screenshot if you want.
---
All of these modifiers are stupid and ruin the game.
---
Any map with at least one tile of bush
---
Good music bro!  :) thx to make masterpiece
---
I actually hate Showdown, just in general. I've been more or less exclusively playing Gem Grab with Crow.
---
And yeah like I said, I'm no pro here :) My highest is just over 400 trophies, the rest are in the 300's or lower. So easiness is relative.
---
Definitely Not! Pay to Wins already have so much benifit over the free to play players in all SUPERCELL games (a little bit less in this one as compared to CR, and CoC and I'd like to keep it that way)! That's exploitation of the free to play players! Most of us who play these games (Most not all, that way there are many adult skilled YouTubers getting money off of making BS/CR videos, and most who watch them) are kids (10-16) and our parents don't allow to lets us spend a fortune on the game! I already left CR because SUPERCELL crossed the limits and become greedy AF!!!  That's the exploitation if the Free to Play Player!! (Though, I don't blame them, They also need to earn money, most other games either cost money to download or show us a dozen ads in a few minutes, This is Supercell's way to earn profit, But they crossed the limits in CR, Hope doesn't happeb in Brawl Stars, I love the game and won't like to leave, one more thing is they added like 90 cards in the game from like 60/70, It's tough for F2P's to unlock most of them which turns into their disadvantage, They added cards w/o even thinking they need it or not and added shitty cards, Though, I manages to get 7 legendaries but after like 1¬Ω year, but in BS, I unlocked my 1st mythic in a month or so, and already have 16 cards (all level 5/6) and  2.5k trophies)
---
12
---
In this case her jessie is ready for level 9.
---
It's hard to tell when it's it a comment, especially because I'm and idiot.
---
Well, I tried my best :') but oh well, whatever works for ya.. :)
---
All healing works it just works a little less while poisoned.  ie. Pam's station heals for 400 and poison deals 98 damage for 4 seconds = healing of 302 for 4 seconds.  This means poison does absolutely nothing to help you other than the poisoned brawler does 10% less damage if you have crows star power.  
---
holy crap phoenix crow needs some medicine
---
Yeah that's probably fair, I haven't played the other two but I'm guessing Leon makes Crow look pretty lame.
---
I just like how different he is, my other favorites (Piper and Darryl) are kind of the same way, they have some fundamentally different gameplay than the others. 
---
I was talking about switching this one and the one in the meme are you dumb
---
yep, thats mortis
---
Aren't you a creature of the night?
---
I have around 50, best of luck my friend... üòâ
---
Maybe Okay, If for like 500 gold on the 3rd time, 1000 on 4th, 1500 on 5th but not gems!!!!
---
This is the funniest post I have ever seen in my history of being on reddit! Think ya forgot the Humor flair buddy üòâ

i wish you unlock the Carl üòò

The opposite post was made but the mortis gang
---
Yeah I totally understand what you‚Äôre saying but buying a name change doesn‚Äôt give you an advantage in the game. At least that‚Äôs what I think? Lmao.
---
EXPOSE HIM
---
r/woooosh on you 
---
_**No YoU dIdN't GeT tHe JoKe**_
---
Yes but like if the star power was 50% less healing, Pam station would heal 50%*400 = 200 - poison (98) = 102
---
r/shellygang
---
When you don't have anything to say
---
So good works :))
---
YES
---
Congrats but repost
---
anything except for thousand lakes
---
It will be a lot worse in my opinion. It woulf be countering just 3 brawlers (Poco, Pam and Gene)
---
If he gets jus a buff in his star power would be a lot better.. like 20% damage reduction
---
~~WhEn YoU dOn'T hAvE aNyThInG tO sAy~~

In my opinion is a recovery to the lack of damage against a bull, when they are at close range. In Brawl Ball she is only used to counter short ranged tanks and in Showdown it is dependent of the map

How do u expect a mythic or legendary at all rank 10s?? I got a legendary (spike) at 9k and a mythic (tara) at around 6 or 7k
---
Yes
---
True
---
Probably not 
---
What?

But good work either way

I have 5k and sry for calling ur nub. I just didn't have stamina to figure better word.

Nerf Shelly's ult.that chain is a little bit OP
---
Those devices have bigger screens than some, so not doing so gives tge players with big phones an advantage.
---
What Op means is that to be static, like, always in the bottom left corner. I guess. In the current option is locked in the spot you place your finger on.
---
Oof, Sherlock

Bruh

Now this is art

---
I aspire to become a Derryl main that can pull stuff off like that
---
Lmao that would be funny
---
Imagine.
---
I would suggest waiting like an hour or so. Then, before opening your boxes, check if you can actually unlock him 
---
no
---
No. It just get rid of it change it so it is fair just doesn‚Äôt cut off the screen because it‚Äôs annoying 
---
Well then u might be very close to getting a new brawler 
---
He just used a program, it's not that difficult 
---
Bull can't catch a shelly by surprise because he knows he'll die instead.
---
Crow doesn‚Äôt need a buff! Don‚Äôt make him as broken as Darryl was and Pam still is.
---
Crow is not good
---
He is ok
---
In my opinion his star power is awful 
---
I love that people don't realize that this is a program, theyre not hang placed lmao 
---
That would be unfair to people using other devices 
---
This. I doubt the gene fiasco will happen again, but after hoarding boxes for several weeks, waiting another couple hours won't hurt.

Yeah that's just natural strategy when it's down to 3. 6+Piper going to see you as biggest threat against them coming in 1st, 1+Piper just wants to come in 2nd. Look on the bright side you still lasted to final 3. You wont come in 1st every time without a ton of luck, amazing reflexes and psychic abilities knowing what every opponent will do.

I love it but a 5th skin for Mortis will be rediculous
---
How do you know that
---
I think I will buy him with gems to not reduce my chances to get leon xD 
---
Yes I understand that you mean, but with the strength with which it would pull it I would see it well anyway

i know it isn't the highest priority right now, but there are a few pros   
---
[1.you](https://1.you)'d be able to equip new avatars (people just love to flex)  
---
[2.it](https://2.it)'s a new reason to buy the skins, they'd have more value   
---
[3.it](https://3.it) adds some polish to the game  
---
[4.it](https://4.it) just looks cool lol
---
please no lol

Confusion 
---
Nooooooo Penny gang
---
Because I've used it before, it's called Note Block Studio
---
I‚Äôm not taking anything personally. Don‚Äôt know why you would think that but ok buddy. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 
---
Holy frick
---
I hate it... I think teamers should be banned. This is just stupid... I can't understand why Supercell is okay with teaming it's named SOLO and not Spin and let skilled player lose more trophies...
---
Thank you! I publish a skin a dayüî•
---
what does Penny gang have to do with nita ;~;
---
But what if that Mortis has 5 power cubes while Barley has none
---
I like Penny more as a brawler
---
I think Nita is worst than pocho 
---
That being said wait till tomorrow if possible with the release of Carl 
---
New gedi kor honestly
---
The game is already pay to win. Either way, there is a huge luck factor with just getting the brawler in the first place. I got Leon as a f2p in my 2nd month, and my friend who has played for half a year has nothing over super rare. Maybe this could be implemented in PvE modes if people don‚Äôt like it, but I think it‚Äôs a neat idea.
---
My thoughts exactly 
---
I mean i think he‚Äôd prefer not getting down voted for something he doesnt know. I mean look at his comments what the hell is the point of down voting them? Even when he is asking a simple question
---
ok thanks! So I'll credit your reddit post or anything else?
---
Because I didn‚Äôt know it was him. It could‚Äôve been another Leon
---
Turrets already got a nerf

You just have to be patient. Everyone else is. It‚Äôs not like Supercell is going to give you everything you want all the time. Believe me. I have a mini account and I got 50 gems in a week. Luck is a factor in the boxes as well. Keep playing and good things will come to you. üôÇ
---
nice watermark
---
for every comment that gets published i just hate you all a lil bit more and im going to purposely tilt all the way to rank 5 with barley and its gonna be ur fault
---
Sure! Thanks!
---
This is actually pretty good, maybe add more ways to get into the middle but other than that it's fine! I suggest you save this and add it to "make-a-map-Monday" to guarantee it gets seen by the devs.
---
Exactly. Supercell can let anyone do anything outside of the TOS, but they can punish people for breaking the agreement. It‚Äôs their game so let them do what they want.
---
Can‚Äôt wait.
---
Lol I sound sarcastic 
---
.\_.
---
What is make a map Monday and how can I send it?
---
Why does the shelly on the right looks like Dio from jojo's bizarre adventure ? xD but they are cool for real :p
---
Every Monday there‚Äôs a pinned post that you‚Äôll see called make a map Monday. Just post the link to ur map there and ur set.
---
Noo dont do it there will be wayy too much and it will be complicated dont please
---
Great idea
---
He seems op
---
Adds what?
---
Epic comeback! Btw can i use this clip in a video I'm working on? I'll credit you in the description
---
If -6 per game is ignored, yes, really funny. LOL
---
Oh you're right I actually didn't finish the shelly off
---
Even the last sentence is a copy of Flying Machine‚Äôs post wtf 
---
I have it on my twitter I guess u want to see it
---
ok that's a huge compliment
---
üòÇ
---
Yeah I mean that was what I was going for, Tanks in the mid and long range on the sides. Also each singular lane is symmetrical. I hate bush camping aswell sometimes ;)

Not enough people saw, so you repost? Smart

Pam doesn't need a range nerf. She needs more bolts spread (instead of 4 center, 2 left and 2 right, it should be 2 center-left, 2 center-right, 2 left and 2 right) to reduce ranged damage.
---
Wow clutch! Btw can i use this clip in a video I'm working on? I'll credit you in the description
---
Could be worse

Repost

Good map though I don't think the fence posts around the safe are much of a thing in heist anymore. This map seems like it'd be a pretty good spot for throwers
---
*inserts John cena u sure abt that*
