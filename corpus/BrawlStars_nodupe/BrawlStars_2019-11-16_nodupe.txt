Mom pick me up I’m scared

---
---
If present he might be ultra legendary
---
Come at me Lukiebear!
---
Fair enough I just use him to get the ball and some trickshots with his dash attack
---
Bibi rosa emz tick are global brawlers while pam is in beta she has been here since the second major update
---
Same
---
Its okay i think
---
I’m gonna backflip off my roof
---
Dude this is almost as sick as my dying grandma 10/10
---
Yeah, but the dash is really the only thing going for him. He can dribble fairly decently, but other brawlers can do it too.. El primo is excellent at dribbling, and can break down walls and is also fairly useful even when he doesn’t have the ball.
---
You mean close
---
My thoughts on my experience with Brawl Stars:
---
How I came into the game - friend introduced me (who stopped playing due to reasons below.) 
---
Who do I like playing - Brock, Dynamike, Rico, Primo, Tick, and Piper.
---
Best and worst - Tick rank 24, Carl rank 15. 
---
28/30 unlocked brawlers. 
---
 
---
THE BIG ISSUE. 
---
It is fair to say I have been in the game for as long as many of us playing around here, and I remember something about the Brawl Star devs saying something along the lines of "you better get a friend to progress and finish trophy road." or something like that. And I disliked it. I don't think at any point should it become a necessity to have friends to carry or support you for any game. And there's a lot of things I can say here.
---
I love Brawl Stars, except for one specific thing: the matchmaking. I have posted on this subreddit several instances of me being at around 400-500 trophies and getting paired with someone around 200 trophies. 
---
And the worst part is, this community thinks that "oh they're in a party" is a justifiable reason to allow this to happen. In extreme cases 8 have seen the enemy get paired with 50 trophies. At the range of 500+. Ridiculous.
---
What's the developer's excuse? "Get a friend."
---
What is worse is that there are times they're obviously NOT in a party and certainly cannot be me because I don't party. (When the low rank leaves but doesn't cause the other guy to instantly X, that's when they aren't in a party.)
---

---
I also have an entire folder of screenshots harboring all the times myself or the enemy team get paired unfairly.
---
If you ask me, a company as highly regarded as Supercell shouldn't allow such things to happen. I have my own theories as to why they do so but when trophies have this much meaning in this game, they should at least respect it to a degree.
---
There are many ways to resolve this issue. Some seem obvious to me, a person who has no grounds in Game Development. Like putting a threshold onto partying with trophy counts, cannot be too low or too high. Or having an option to go play with equal ranks, and can have higher stakes. Many many solutions and the Brawl Star team seems to deem this unnecessary.
---
Now that I have finished Trophy Road, I guess I will get all my brawlers to Rank 20, provided I can get the gold needed to upgrade them. And I really hope the fix this before I accomplish that.
---
My brother asked if this works...
---
Tldr Matchmaking trash and needs to be fixed badly. No excuses coming from Supercell.
---
i sometimes stay after loss for at least one more vistory after good run, even if i want to turn of the game just so the teammates dont think i left because we lost once
---
Good job!
---
Bruh, how many trophies do you have?
---
I once did 17 barley jumps. And with tick I’ve done 23. Amateur.
---
nah thanks.
---
But then 6/6

Do none of you actually realise he’s breaking one of the rules and asking for upvotes????Anyways I’ll still upvote this cause Kairos’s voice is gone be epic
---
Lol I never knew about that rule, I'll keep that in mind.
---
Its kinda true i also played when the game got in beta (like 2 years ago) and i got crow at that time the only brawler i need is sandy and i’m like lvl 110.
---

Same kind of thing happened to me he was in my team first and was playing like dogshit and i played against him and he played like an champion!?!?!?

"Morris".No,everyone are joking about Dyna being Mortis's food

This sometimes happens when you get matched up with a random guy who just unlocked a brawler when your brawler are at &gt;500 trophies.

We are talking about Showdown. The great thing about this gamemode is that opponents aren't dumb enough to spend time chasing a Mortis they can't catch while actually threatening opponents collect powercubes and become stronger

It is my 11th month in the game. I have 15,8k as the best trophy count and a crow.

I too got maybe not so much bored but a bit fed up with matchmaking etc. And aI have been taking a break from the game. It was harder to start than I thought but it is starting to work. I am much calmer and don’t get pissed about anything any more.

I will probably come back for another try, maybe tomorrow, maybe next year

I've got a huge nerf..

*But at what cost?*

chonky boi

How is that a stroke?

They should make this into a skin tbh

But barely

It looks reasonable dude. This game is really pisses people off and that isn’t cool because I am playing the game to have fun to relax but these fu...ers are just thinking about money.

That is not entirely true. He did go die once in vain.

Rework is the term you're looking for.

ok sorry about that but if they're gonna spam in Chinese I'll do that to them too
---
Well good for you, some maps require ranged brawlers. Now do u have a maxed tank?
---
IMO, 8-bit should be bigger than most brawlers, cuz real life arcade machines are huge, and also he walks slowly probably because of that
---
And why the heck Rico is as big as most tanks despite his teeny tiny HP
---
Congrats

I wanna go there right now

yeah, totally...can't get over the transformation animation
---
For what reason, exactly?
---
It's the Beta one, plus I don't like AC.
---
Only 1 long range brawler... This Is obviusly a 400 trophies play.
---
El primo gets primoed
---
brock has 3 skins (or more)

crow has &amp; skins...so....

But ok,if you want then you want

Santa Pam, Pine Rosa?

tick
---
thanks))

Exactly! Just shining a light on it so everyone can get some ez trophies.

I would play Piper or Colt at this map, but I only needed 1 trophy for 500 so this is why I brought bull.

it's not supercell fault, maybe this shelly is friend of dyna or penny, and they thought that it was a good idea bring a low trophies player into high trophies games.

Pam Colt and shelly/bull (Pam should take Every single Power cube).

i like how you put a huge watermark like someone would copy this piece of crap

---
Here is one reason why I use watermarks
---
Honestly I think this:
---
Nita and Colt = common brawler
---
Bull and Jessie = rare brawler
---
Brock and Dynamike = super rare brawler
---
Bo and Tick = epic brawler
---
8-Bit and EMZ = mythic brawler
---
??? (10000 trophy road brawler) = legendary brawler
---
It is supposed to be water hahah

if he wants to spend 50$ on a game then he can do that, he enjoys the game and wants to support the developers.. nothing wrong with that

Just around $10 would be alright but $50?
---
I just feel that it’s too much
---
thats funny considering everyone on the thread right now hates shelly and approves of my point except you, go look for other 999 threads about nerfing shelly. they are everywhere. posting this and trying to humiliate me just generally decreased your reputation and karma.
---
You got 4 tickets too you lucky bastard
---
im at 13k trophies, and shelly is actually good in showdown. not sure what you're talking about, or you just can't use shelly properly. and again rico's and colts attacks are easy to predict and dodge especially their ultimates. shelly is bad in lone star unless you camp which is somewhat effective. currently have shelly at 742 getting her up again. it's all about how you play the brawlers. and ftw servers matter too, i don't see that many colts or ricos in brawl ball but only some bibis brocks and el primo.

That was a good read!

I overall feel like BS is more skill-based at some point, given that it focuses mire on little things like aiming your base attack.

And also the simplicity. They are a different type of game where it comes to it.

Then collect them all

Bruh stop karma whoreing
---
I meant Colt and Rico in Takedown, not Brawl Ball. Unless you are talking about meteor maps, which I render as the good Shelly showdown maps. Also, Rico players are generally better at hitting their shots than Colt.

they were turkish and team so nothin anormal

Entertainment &gt; skill though. No one is going to watch a boring videogame no matter how much skill it takes. Is Fortnite skill dependant? Yes. Is it fun to watch? No, not for me.

Well, you like nita too? We can be friends
---
Thank you almighty spike
---
Ma sei italiano
---
Don't have to win solo/duo to gain trophy

Yeah.

I think green means the brawler your controlling,blue is a teammate, and red is an enemy

I pushed him to 300 at power 2 in one day, back when that was hard.

Dis deserve upvote

When my sister and I first saw this we laughed so hard

this guy must be the most persisten "player" ever then. if I were to play like that up to 13k trophies, Id have 2 braincells by now
---
😂 if i didnt know 8-bit was an arcade machine that wouldve been so much funnier
---
What's about showing the other player's brawlers, not only the favorite one? for example instead of clan members. I think it will look better, and will contain more information about player.
---
Actually - your idea is very cool!

As long as you keep opening boxes your chances will increase and thos chances are pretty high
---
Do you know the amount this clay sculpture has expanded my eyes by?
---
The favorite brawler thing is actually similiar to clash royale favorite card where it counts how many time you placed the carf down in the month and makes the most placed card your favorite until you place a different card down een more often than the current card and here is the same thing with brawlers
---
and that’s good, because I wanted to do something terribly funny
---
Enemy team asleep at the wheel
---
Keep on the good work 😄
---
Frank is lucky, he cant talk so now since Emz is even taller than him she can tell everyone the doorways are to low and Frank will stop hitting his head on the doorway
---
Thank u :)
---
The decision is already made and I cant change the pic of the post
---
I love the idea, but the stats need to be changed. Great post man!
---
This is sad, hope you'll get all of them👊

Also how would you choose how to alternate between attacks? Would it be like one ammo slot is the first attack and the second is the other one?
---
Bo tak się nazywało zanim to usunąłem i dałem ponownie. A w tedy mi nie zwrócileś uwagi
---
I do not. I'm hoping that we hear something in the next Brawl Talk
---
Bo tego nie zobaczyłem :P
---
No no no, you use your super to alternate between melee and ranged, as simple as that
---
Thanks for the support!
---
Which ones?
---
No shut up
---
Dynamike !
---
It's tick
---
Thank you. If you sub, I'll be closer to making a QNA video at 50 subs. If don't have to, bit I'm just saying :)
---
I used to hate Cavern Churn. But since i embraced rico i patiently wait for ir every season.
---
no rico no richie?
---
That was the first time we got to see it! We we're shocked! I had chills going up and down my spine haha
---

What do you use to make animation?

Are you using com or tab or mobile?
---
*Ok, i subs you :)
---
I bravery not withdut for almost 3 months( that's what I said
---
I mean in the original post, I don't speak russian волк
---
Even if there are players under 16 who would do a great job at playing, there are a lot of legal reasons why that's not possible
---
wow
---
Beetlejuiceing is when someone's "username checks out"
---
There’s no way that would take forever
---
Ask: Do you like eating sand?
---
You gotta charge ur super first and rico is squishy plus firing will only make you visible to enemies

When?
---
You shouldn't buy any of them because its a gem waste, spend them on tickets
---
Wow?
---
*Flair checks out*
---
Bomb=nerf
---
What is "witchone"?
---
Atleast it’s safe to assume that this is probably the alt account of someone who has a decent understanding of the game, considering his previous season’s Power Play points
---
Ok, ok, ok... Now THIS, THIS is epic
---
Me too i have no legendaries i have 14 k trophies and my chances are 0.2163% i know how you feel
---
i also want change. for Heist... I want Forks Out, Fancy Fensing, Bandit Stash and Bridge Too Far back.
---
For Bounty: Sunstroke, Temple Ruins, Excel, Dry Season, Hideout, Bull Pen back.
---
Siege: Straight Shot, Robo Highway and Mecha Match.
---
We should have 3 settings for favourite character:
---
1- Choose Yourself
---
2- Choose Automatically (A): Choose according to which character you play most. (Doesn't depend on cups or level)
---
3- Choose Automatically (B): Choose according to which character you play best. (Doesn't depend on cups or level)
---
*Automatically B* is recommended.
---
And you only replied to my comment, not to anyone else's because you simply can't find another way to defend yourself.
---
Again, sad.
---
Bro its not easy that much xDDD
---
mhm
---
Nah trust me it is.
---
Is that Connie from Brickleberry?
---
bs, Cavern Churn is a painful map. I am a Barley main. and its filled to the brim with Shellies, Bulls, Rosas, El Primos.
---
How old are you..?
---
I like how you arrange you character + schedule..
---
I'm a Youtuber too but i'm a normal BS content creator :)
---
Nie
---
Cool
---
A voice of reason.. finally.
---
I mean I wouldn't be complaining free win
---
I guess they wanted to buff the other star power (invisiheal) and then if we got 7 seconds of invisibility we will get 7000 hp and they saw that too much so they made 6 seconds for 6000 hp
---
Good job tho
---
Aww man i thought leon and nita were a ship oh well
---
Good job on the watermark, thieves have no chance of cropping it out
---
Lol they are even worse clickbaiters then english yters
---
utter Cancer
---
**.:Role:.**
---
Leon - Chara
---
How many slices of bread have you eaten
---
You just change two words lol.
---
Yeah, but i want more
---
I more so hated it cause it felt very unoriginal. It felt like CoC and Boom Beach had a baby.
---
amazing
---
That one rich kid at school before going home must have looked like
---
Yesterday was my 16th birthday, and I got crow that day, so happy 😁
---
The Carl when he throws his pickaxe
---
Approved
---
Most no clickbaiters is Tori and vcr
---
Barley: How many poco’s have you eaten?
---
Rico: Yes
---
Completely low-effort
---
Making her more monstrous in big game???
---
Im not under rank 20 lmao. This map gives too much advantage to certain brawlers.
---
Nice
---
*thiccochet approve the 2nd*
---
Yeah but what to do when storm closes in
---
Loafs of bread
---
None mega box offers are a scam its gonna give you 5 items
---
I just get crow 1st November at 14k , good luck for that legendary!  I hope you get you're favourite legendary
---
I LOVE IT!!! The new super about switching is super cool!
---
and maybe, you get a bonus chance to get powerpoints for that brawler  
---
\* Looks at untouched power 1 bull with 1173 power points \*
---
Reloading your Hammer...
---
Or your baseball Bat
---
Or your pickaxe
---
Or your mystical energy from your amullet
---
Or painting spray
---
Or drinks
---
....yeah
---
Me jealous
---
He actually kinda is lmao. Check his horrible post history
---
Hei suomalainen
---
So waht ám I going to do with it? I think you wanna play BS in a Forest,at winter in the game.
---
Supercell: *throw a nerf bomb)
---
Leon: welp, guess is time to die
---
Frank and Penny's powers are a bit imbalanced. Destroying walls will break the game.
---
Sorry time to deleate this post
---
this man's got barley at rank 75
---
You can do better man,screenshots normally aren't funny
---
I actually did absolutely nothing to the name, if you have a tall and capitalized name it makes it closer to the icon.
---
Sorry fore posting low effort trash hopefully won't happen again
---
Yup, what a toxic reposter. Does he even know how to draw? lol
---
Everybody keeps talking about it every single Time. And I don't really like it.
---
I did not find this image as amusing or humorous. I have not performed a human action, which involves reacting at humorous or amusing content by chuckling at it in a happy way, commonly known as "laughing".
---
But can I choose my favourite brawler? Or is the brawler who I use more??
---
Like him! What rarity is he though?
---
It's ok,nobody is perfect
---
This is awesome, I want to buy it lol
---
Fuck that sub honestly
---
Schrödinger cat...
---
Look on the bright side, that means you will get one soon!
---
Seems like that frank didn't know that
---
this is really bad jesus christ even i could make this and i suck at editing
---
Secondly,if u got zo unlucky that centre isnt destroyed,try to bait,it will mostly work,show yourself,than wait 3 seconds,start moving back,and u will catch two shellys/bulls fighting,only thing lasted is to third party them.
---
It still doesn't change that people under power 10 will now be versing power 12s, which will heavily influence a game
---
u/repostsleuthbot
---
wow wait it has the 'humor' tag so it funny
---
Exactly
---
Oh wow. I never knew that, I’ll keep that in mind :0
---
A good way to balance him would be some sort of  speed during his stages. E.g. he is faster when in meele stage like Bibi with star power and slower when in ranged. It might even be a good balance if it would be swapped so slower when meele or faster if ranged
---
I like it
---
Leon is very clearly from South America, not from West Europe.
---
Very nice
---
#1 up is my game
---
Same, congrats to you too
---
Very sexy 🌚
---
That's in Helsinki's beach, I think...

Thatd be a neat concept, actually.

No you 🌚

Very good idea. I like it

Randoms (typo)

Wait your on to something, what happen if we get these boxes in showdown?, instead of getting power it’s a bomb or a cat??
---
That's for robbing Piper from him.

Crow skins are recolor 😑
---
This is game breaking news..

They are giving f2p players more rewards every updates

---
That's ridiculous wow......
---
Single Event ticket: cries in shit

F for the enemy team

i guess el primo reloading makes sense, beacuse he get tired, and it's super fast tho

They leave bats but you pick them up instantly

GG man rank 25 is pretty decent (I got my 2nd favourite brawler there aswell xd....) but congrats 😉😉

---
Is that a J^(o)J^(o) R^(ef)r^(en)ce
---
Sure for gameplay but I don't think supercell see this in the same way
---
Nice but I think her eyes are kinda weird
---
No its not piper Calvera designs its just traditional stuff when it comes to  the day of the dead.
---
It would also be awesome as long as it isn't like night witch mortis
---
Yeah. They are using this fact and studying the results to try to kill viruses and infections and stuff like that without hurting the people
---
This is so low effort lol
