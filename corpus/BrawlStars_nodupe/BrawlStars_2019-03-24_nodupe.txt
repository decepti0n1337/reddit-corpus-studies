Good bot!

Am I the only one that doesnt dislike much about him aside from the fact that he doesnt talk.  Everyone else has a ready up voice clip that cycles around, and I enjoy that.  
---

---
GIVE CARL A VOICE!
---
That's a mistake on them if they start making idiotic plays for a measly title.
---
I think this is a good thing to implement, makes you feel rewarded on being a carry player. It encourages everyone to play skillfully to get a "Star Player" reward, it could also lessen idiots actually rather than make more.

Something which people noticed since it was released at least a month ago

Even better attack himself while he‚Äôs already dead.
---
At least it‚Äôs only $4.99. Mine is $13.99
---
Again, getting star player doesn't mean you carried the team.
---
HAHA YEAH TOTALLYüòÇüî•üëåüÖ±Ô∏èüòÇ
---
I was exaggerating a bit... only like 10 big boxes and a handful of regular boxes. But my friend went on, opened one box, and got carl. I have 400 more trophies than him and he more brawlers than me

Except Old Mortis is nightmare fuel

I should be up there I‚Äôm a good artist
---
I know his super is great, but that is only if you can hit. As i mentioned it can be disrupted by nearly every brawler. And it would be hard to keep him balanced but after you get to a certain point it is impossible to get him further unless you are a god with him.
---
This is your coolest one yet. I would buy this immediately üò©

Thank you

They want you to pay for gold/gems to afford ranking up your brawlers before you can win.

He does. He just doesnt consume ammo when passing the ball. Ik that's what you meant but eh
---
Hello everyone! In short, this map is supposed to encourage strategy and teamwork. Let me give you an example: Your team wins the midfight, and you take the ball. You could take the left turn (slowest option), or go right yourself. However, the fastest would be for one of your teammates to step onto the launch pad and be launched forward. From there, you could pass the ball to the teammate in ahead of you and let them take a shot at the goal, and as I said, that's what this map is all about: strategy and teamwork. Of course, you could also use the pads to play more aggressively, which is why I think both long and short range brawlers would be good here: shotgunners and tanks could stand where an enemy is about to fall to and easily take them out. And it's the same way around:they could use the launch pads, and not be threatened by someone standing to the fall location.

---
Are you a furry, Crow?
---
Problem: Time has stopped
---
Shelly only shines with her super.
---
Crow and Leon are good to do what they do.
---
Pam just needs that the 4 central bolts went more spread within the other 4 bilts, so she doesn't do half damage from far away.
---
Well i see u have Mortis at rank 16, means you either played not much or that you suck hard (if your really an OG). 
---
No offense tho, but obviously if you don't play you won't get any legendaries.
---
You have link this video?

One tile gaps, no thanks!

Pretty cool but not that interesting to walk across a lake so maybe make it have some effect on brawlers ,great idea nonetheless

Why were u using mortis in vault defenders

Deserves 10k upvotes

Yeah this is what I was thinking even while doing it. I just wanted to give this out on a more basic form, I tought about a similar mechanic that fortnite as(or real life lol) when you walk on the ice. There has been some great suggestions from the community aswell. I do think tho that this change during a match could completly change a strategy and gamestyle of the teams/players.

If I have no idea of how to play crow, then why is my crow at 515 trophies? Even if crow can spot people who are in the bushes for a long time, Bo with his star power can do it, except way better as you don't have to attack the bushes to do so.
---
**jessie will remember that**
---
Yeah I guess my competitive eSports mind is taking over lol. More casuals are playing the game so Supercell is obliviously going to concentrate nore on them.
---
Crow too
---
F
---
WHY NOT DESTROY MY TEAMMATES WITH HIS SUPER, BEING A MINER AND ALL
---
this^
---
imo crow still needs a slight buff (i have him at 500 trophies as lvl 8),  but he‚Äôs not as bad as most people make him out to be. yes, he has a higher skill cap than most brawlers, but that doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs bad. it means people who only know how to spam auto-aim with bull and shelly and primo will think he‚Äôs bad lmao
---
Lmao
---
it's not my idea lol it's been done before and it's pretty easy to think about that too
---
i made mine so supercell could see that we really want this in the game, and the more people do these icons, the better, since supercell would really start to notice it
---
great job dude, these are great and i want to see more from you, they're cleaner than mine and they actually look like straight from the game!

Never play with my feeling ;-;
---
I miss him
---
This is a pretty good idea in my opinion. However this would have to be seperate queues/matchmaking because imagine having 5 players on gemgrab having this on and only 1 off.  It could cause some pretty heavy trophy.

This reminded me of Idle Heroes, cause Horus

Did you watch OJ's video where he like goes into SD (Healing Mushrooms) Teams up and stays in like both poison clouds and Mushrooms just like in this picture and makes a Showdown battle 12 minutes long!

Bro I got my crow to 500 at level 4 easily and saw a post before with someone that got him to 500 at level 1. 
---
The map is it a desert
---
I haven‚Äôt the foggiest idea
---
Could be, thanks!
---
I feel like people use him as a tank just extremely aggressive and expect not to die with the small hp he has.

I have 4k trophies. Got every brawler except gene

Poor mortis

I have a perfect idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa new brawler

very good fanart! it must have taken several hours to complete
---
Maybe it could be the effect of a brawlers attack or super.  It would have to do something else though, because not all maps have water.
---
I just posted a friend request
---
Sure,
---
Unlikely, still a repost.
---
People have to understand that incidents like this don‚Äôt happen accidentally... what your friend did was buy gems used them and got a refund of his money. Supercell saw this and took action into their own hands. What your friend did is wrong and cheating. Simple as that. He can say he didn‚Äôt do it all he wants but this is the only way that this could of happened. 
---
OP is a teamer.
---

---
I have a quick question: I use the same recorder and how do you turn on game audio?
---
One word: leon
---
It was confirmed by Frank that there will be more trophy road brawlers.
---
Yup
---
Liberals successfully defeated, good job team.
---
What no ones thinking about is that that Carl is just a super rare, he‚Äôs not going to be THAT good
---
bruh i got Penny Frank and Gene all in the same week
---
Teaming is for cowards. Spin so they give you a clear shot. Betray immediately. Duos are for people who want to team. 
---
I remember that I bought barley with that
---
Good thing you guys were getting smacked anyways
---
keep doing what your doing, but please don't spin after killing someone
---
That was so lucky
---
I never said it was mine lol, if it‚Äôs leaked then obviously I didn‚Äôt make it XD 
---
They need that back bc I been playing since early beta and still don‚Äôt have legendary
---
Hey asshole...WHAT DID YOU SAY ABOUT MY HAIR?!
---
Yeah I know that, this is actually my 2nd acc
---
I got him level 5 and he is really fun to play. But I think he either needs more dps in the form of a faster throw or, faster movement speed to not take away from the skill shot dynamic he's got going on. As in moving to widen the arc. Also increasing movement speed would increase his chances of survival as well. It would be the best buff imo
---
Haha
---
That‚Äôs not how it works, Brawlers are not balanced based off their Rarity. Being Super Rare has no effect on how good he is.
---
I like how Gedi-Kor doesnt own the title of most upvoted post on the subreddit but the guy who is promoting him does get that title.

My friend at 2000 trophies have all 3 legendaries

Interesting! Thanks for the heads up on that. Unfortunately doesn't address the issue of playing with randoms but this will do I think.

I would repost it with a pic of an underpowered character on his face bc I think the mods will take this down

You guys got it all wrong, dyna and pam teamed with the bots

Wow,I like it

Carl's star power should be shooting either 2 or 3 pickaxes for main attack. Imagine him having spread. It'll do so much more damage

I still don‚Äôt get why people think crow needs a nerf

Spike does not need faster movement speed. 
---
He already made Tara though 
---
Colt is good in the new showdown map..

Great work. You should do a skin for Bo with a Rambo motif. You know: with Rambo‚Äôs iconic head band, black combat pants and boots and of course Rambo‚Äôs bow with exploding tip arrows. And call it Ram-Bo

No you suck
---
Reduced damage during super Lol jk...
---
Maybe after a killing blow, his axe, immediately and comes back, faster too? Doesn't have to go any further than the dead guy.
---
Also, make multiple star powers soon. I could see this once we have around 54 brawlers, and switchable star powers, maybe supers, to help competitive play with a ranked draft mode
---
Can you play anymap you want? 
---
Ohhh
---
m8 how tf u managed to not open them
---
Yes
---
Brock is meant for long range combat and the damage he deals is already good enough. 
---
Where can I download it? 
---
I don't think Brock needs a buff. Considering that his range is the longest in the game along with Piper, the damage is pretty high.
---
It's a mod I can send you the link

That's some nostalgia right there

Save tickets + token doubler and just farm it, thats what i like to do. Do good and you will get around 20 boxes in no time

His range is long but he is so  i n s u f f i c i e n t

You dont even mention the art

How did you get this mod man?

How so?

Na probably spent a load of money
---
2100 trophies? your not supposed to have lots of brawlers then
---
Its Gene ( the longest range) . But gene has a low damage

This is so true

Bull just needs a nice splash of green

Please do that

He is very bad at 1v1 i think

Oh my god! You are the best, bro!

You might be able to sell your art to supercell, looks great for a phone case
---
Thank you so much ‚ù§
---
fuck it. she/he needs to be hired too by supercell.
---
Can you give me a link to make a brawl star map and play
---
That is some nostalgia
---
What‚Äôs the joke here? By coincidence I have Jessie at Rank 16 with 7 power level 
---
Oh wait it‚Äôs Carl idiots
---
My worst tilt was Shelly from 479 to 300, welcome to the world of randoms, some are not bad though lol
---
 Do
---
#FRONK
---
really easy to do it
---
I got 7x 200 token doublers in 4 days
---
So basically my odds of getting them is 0.0075
---
But still no Carl, Frank, Mythics or Legendaries
---
No once you reach 1410 power points you have no more in the boxes, even if you do not upgrade your Brawler. My english can be bad because I‚Äôm french :)
---
Nerf Carl and plz don't let his ammo pass through walls
---
I just did TJ, 2 hours ago!
---
I don't think you can make it yourself and play it I didn't make it was already in there
---
Rockland? =) 
---
This exists already in Brawlstars
---
Damn Dex.. Dax good man!
---
GeT tHiS oUt oF My FeEd
---
You phrased your answers better than the original questioner. I have Nita at level 7 with about 700 power points so I was curious. 
---
Thank you for the answer!
---
already posted that here, buddy
---
It will be sick if u can draw a Mega Knight Primo skin!!
---
sorry i forgot to put the link
---
[https://crux.page.link/A9oz](https://crux.page.link/A9oz)
---
Yes please it's really interesting. And keep up the good work!
---
Haha no problem, Good Luck to max your Nita, her Star Power is really good ;)
---
Rip Mortis xDDDDDD
---
Man, Mortis icon look funky without his hat
---
Leonnn
---
122 so far but got him yesterday and didn‚Äôt play all day ü§£
---
When he dies and the pickaxe is still in the air it will be better if the pickaxe come back to the place he died
---
You're going to have to keep grinding to not fall behind, you're only ahead by 1!
---
6-3vs3
---
Really nice drawing 
---
And you already have him at level 9?! Mine is at 514 trophies at Level 8. I first got him to 500 at Level 7
---
Thank you! üôè
---
r/subsifellfor
---
i really like this. Carl is a miner, right? should have some wall breaking ability. Maybe just his super now breaks the walls that he runs in to
---
i felt that
---
How can you gain 200 boxes in one day? Robo rumble? 
---
Pixar carl
---
Hmmm.hacks...just kidding bro this is so COOOL!!!!
---
Lol
---
im at 10k. been playing since android release and still no legendaries :(
---
ohh thats hot
---
In the end game the entire screen would be filled with robot pointers.

---
That's plain biased towards P2W
---
I call them mouse bots because they look like mice

That‚Äôs very nice! (By the way, I read your profile and noticed the fact that you‚Äôre from Taiwan so I‚Äôll try to write this in chinese) amazing art and keep it up :)

IKR! Leon is so broken
---
You just made a few bulls turn their heads
---
Wow impressive üôåüôåüôå none of my brawlers are above 400 trophies but I‚Äôll try to get Crow my first brawler at that level.
---
You defo mastered him üëç
---
I push him at level 9 with few mega boxes since all my other brawlers have reached the max power up number to be push to power rank 8 and 9, each megabox was giving me power up only for Crow üôè
---
Just don‚Äôt have the coins to push them all to power 9.
---
How long have you got him ? 
---
Yea, he‚Äôs some bad memorys...
---
Since October
---
Barley,Tara and a mouse of the night
---
The game was made by SSundee and i think even he has forgotten about it 
---

---
6 months only. Well done not sure I‚Äôll manage to be that good üòÇ
---
You‚Äôre right but originally it was too little and doesn‚Äôt looked like pennys
---
Island invasion + Darryl would break the game
---
BUT I like the concept:)
---
Thank you!!
---
Ovviously leon 
---
Please do it 
---
I think everyone would like it 
---
Please
---
Leon!!!
---
+$3 for enchant
---
one time i faced the #1 bull and #1 barley in the world and a 600 trophy rico while my team was all below 500
---
nowhere near as tragic as this tho

What app did you use for it?

Wait are you sure this wasn't friendly game???
---
\^
---
Though your opponents got some losing trophies!
---
They were like oh hell no
---
ye
---
I think Carl is in a pretty good spot as is, his ability is top tier (although lacking a little in damage). His movement feels just a little slow. Tbh nerfing Pam‚Äôs range and damage would indirectly buff both Crow and Carl bc she hard counters them rn
---
Imagine being lucky enough to have a legendary
---
JS that if OP‚Äôs enemies had lost it would be much more devastating for them.

We all know why her mouth is that big...
---
What the fuck of an argument is that? Imagine i'm playing a 500 trophies brawler playing against new players that probably don't even have 500 trophies with all their brawlers combined.

You should change the flare to humor

Ehm.

Also there is a thing called quality. You have to put effort in to quality.

I am 1000th person to upvote this
---
congrats
---
Nah it is good
---
It has been in the game in a heist map. Dont really know why they removed it thouvh
---
It does though. Higher dps, higher health and star power. I don't get how you think power doesn't matter. Best example is in showdown, a level 3 leon needs 4 charges to break their first power box while a level 4 leon only needs 3 charges. The game is balanced in a way that power does matter.

Alright, that's Nita, ok? Let's stop this madness that almost made me laugh to death.

You have only 15 gems

never knew my penny could be this cute

This looks like a character from WALLI.LOL
---
But why though? 
---
It's cute
---
ahhhh I see, thanks for the explanation haha
---
Wait, it's? 
---
Then he should've still been matched with people around 500, not 750+
---
Teamers are dumber than I thought.
---
Il find him and murder him

15 upvotes, enemy team coming up!

I'd like to try that too

I get that, but is that it?

Can we get uhhhhhh Stephen Hawking Carl?

Thanks!

And have lots of speed

Not playing the gamemode how you are supposed to is pretty dumb. And I think it is a fair statement to say that if you can not gain trophies by yourself and have to rely on dumb tactics, you are pretty dumb. I don't understand  how my point doesn't relate to the statement above?
---

They can buff him to cost 100 or so

Similar to Hot point.

Ok. Soon l will do map bigger.

I still wonder how they didn't get copyrighted by the creators of Crash Bandicoot for those TNT box designs
---
You buffed crow with your artistic skills
---
It's better than what I can do
---
You mean teaming, right?
---
Brawl Stars
---
Yeah i wondered too! 
---
There's a gang for each brawler in the game, such as r/genegang or r/mortisgang
---
Opponents were all rank 10 w/ star powers and my team were rank 1 except my colt who is rank 7
---
How about no
---
the joke would need to be funny for r/woosh to work.
---
How do you know this isn't "how you are supposed to"? The devs themselves supported teaming as a legit strategy.
---
&gt; have to rely on dumb tactics
---
How is this dumb? It's a tactic. It helps you win. Therefore it isn't dumb.
---
And you can join the gang when you get that certain brawler
---
May not got Leon, but just got my boi Crow the other day. Honestly fun af, both have very different play styles.
---
Wow
---
Tbh, if they end up releasing a skin for Leon, he will be dead last of all the brawlers to receive skins. As one of the hardest brawlers to get, they can't make nearly as much money off of him as the less rare brawlers.
---
Yes i know but i couldent think of a beter star power and this still be more usefull than the curent one
---
id acctually need your upvote foe more people to see, dont really care for karma, just want to expose this guy
---
I 100% agree.

What if supercell hates you and only gives you the super rare brawlers and below. I have a 0.1584% legendary brawler chance. Anyone got higher?
---
Ooh I love this one, Its like Chef Dynamike‚Äôs rival! :o 
---
In higher levels I can ALMOST understand matchmaking like this, but when I have a team of 3s, matching against a team of 5s is ridiculous. Happens to me a good 25%+ of the time.

You can survive if you take powercubes or healing mushrooms appear.

It's used in graphical context like the mortis night witch skin. Here you don't see anything. So how did they "massacre" your boy? The just killed him

Life is unfair and so is Brawl stars.. move on.. I've not gotten a single brawler in 2 months.

But how is there gameplay with the new barley effects eventhough the map was taken out way beforehandü§î

What is that ‚Äúon any brawler‚Äù thing?

Ja danke nochmal f√ºr den Tipp ;)

Dude ur not even rank 15 or above. How do you know the "meta"? Your still in noob elo
---
Its really just a normal win nothi g else

i mean at least it's readable and not blurry as hell (save for dynamike)
---
That is the best brawl stars pic I have ever seen

There is pam teaming to and it annoyes me

hi can i use your video in my YT?

Pam looks cursed

i dont spend gems on skins but if this was added i'd definitely buy it even tho i'm f2p
---
Why does it look so fake
---
me too
---
Sure :)
---
oh and a poco wiping a crow with attacks you cant dodge but do enough damage to 3-hit him is cool? he can also heal. 
---
Fast
---
Accidentally??? But I have to kill the bull that has 2 gems /s
---
...So? Some random people I've never heard of are more important than Ryan's opinion?
---
Just no
---
I've thought about this a bit, and I'm not actually sure reporting would solve most of the tilting parts of the game. Maybe it would help solve teaming, which is an issue, don't get me wrong. But it's only one game mode (actually more like half a game mode since there is duos). The only other reportable offense I can think of would be intentional throwing, but that would be hard to gauge, since even being AFK isn't necessarily throwing (bad internet, distractions, etc). In my opinion, the most frustration usually comes from teammates just sucking. They pick the wrong brawler, on the wrong map, miss all their shots, these kinds of things. But these aren't reportable. As enraging as it is, you can't try to get people punished/banned for being bad. 
---
So I understand people are wanting a tangible solution, but honestly I think just being in a full, active band where you can get at least one teammate when you want to push is the best solution, since there isn't and never will be a way to ensure you get a good team composition with randoms who don't suck. I can say personally, since switching to only playing with at least one other person I know in my party, my win rate has increased and my tilting has decreased.
---
r/mortisgang
---
I have an idea how best to make the star power at the Colt. With starry power, the Colt with its Super did double damage.
---
xD yeah pam should be nerfed. I don't think epics are that easy to get though. I have pam and piper since like 2 months ago, but frank... I can't get him
---
\**loads super*\* How dare you... Say that again
---
Normal attack could be his gun (which shoots coins, judging by the image), a single projectile that deals more damage from close range.
---
And his super could be a rope that gets attached to the first enemy/wall it hits, then pulls him towards it, dealing damage when hitting an enemy.
---
Star power: Chat's rope has more range and will stun an enemy when it hits
---
Your super won‚Äôt reach me! I will explode you with my mines before you get a chance to blast me!
---
Why would I ever call that fidget spinner boi best or even good
---
It's not stolen you idiot
---
Wow, I luke this skin idea =3

Get a tie so you will get 15 tokens, and then you‚Äôll have an even amount. Then do showdown until you get the right amount of tokens ending in the number ‚ÄúZERO‚Äù. Then, let your key bar fill up and you‚Äôll be all set on a base of 10.
---
Piper is kind of good in heist because the safe is open now and there's no walls in front of it, but yeah who tf uses Bull in bounty
---
Obviously power points 
---
&gt;I will explode 
---
Yes. You will.
---
Hm, it did not work when my tokens went out. But that was only on duo
---
Brawl Stars's maps are too small for 20 players in one match, even if it was a showdown map it would be too messy 
---
Yes I will, when I win over you!

Go ahead,but give credit

this is an epic meme hahaha xd funny

How in the world can people even try and defend this?  You guys must have been on a winning streak and needed a loss to generate frustration Let me give the the typical Supercell BS response to crap like this they pull:

‚ÄúI know that you don't like to hear excuses and thus, I won't give you any. Instead, here's the official post from the QnA with our Devs regarding what they have in mind for the near future: https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/ayakf9/ama_brawl_stars_dev_team_here_to_answer_all_your/‚Äú
---
Wdym. The difference of trophies is like 2300-1500
---
This could be a 30 gem skin if you think about it since it looks simple and similar to poco and Shelly and colt have one 
---
you messed up carl's mouth
---
Wouldn't that be a nerf? ü§î
---
I think you shouldn't buy even when you have enough gem. He's very easy to get from boxes.
---
It would be a buff because of the new attack animation, and a nerf for the price
---
I want Longer respawn times in all team gamemodes so his kills are worth the effort.
---
Why? Will dance off unbalance the game (gandu).... 
---
It was a bug I guess 
---
OwO the likes is 58 as well as the games played together,lemme help u by raising her count
---
JUST got 13m 14s
---
Now i have 62 and i will not buy it seriously the worst brawler

I have watched enough tentacle h*ntai to know where this is going.
---
Crows eat lizards
---
&gt; Their menu is quite varied, including carrion, insects, small rodents, snakes, lizards
---
I mean, that dynamike probably spun his way to 990 trophies so it might not be TOO terrible, but still supercell fix this
---
You know the Dynamike tag next to your username?
---
I like it

You forgot the Jessi poster in the Carl animation
---
How did you test it out?
---
And Pam.

Trophies incentives for kills

It was in the mod already along with old maps and new maps

HE turned out better than poco

Congrats! Meanwhile I‚Äôm stuck in rank 16 with every brawler

Oh sorry, i forgot this was 2019 for a second.

Oh, I am talking about trophies. Well, let me explain myself a little more.
---
You have to play all of them and get them to a m√©dium trophy range (~300 trophies). While you do this, you should be able to upgrade them in the same way, all of them to a medium level (5-6).
---
Now, start with the 3 or 4 you like more and push a little more with them. Keep your gold for their upgrades. Once they are level 9, you should start pushing the ones you left at 300 trophies.
---
Never. NEVER. Never push one brawler and forget about the rest. You will start facing more experienced people if you do that, and you will have no chance.
---
Feel free to ask anything else
---
I only play with randoms so this is normal to me
---
Haha you too :)
---
4.6K. I had more on my old account that I lost. I‚Äôve also been really lucky with new brawlers (just got Pam, gene and piper recently). So some are pretty low.
---
Creative text my friend but you are right (No Hate)
---
If you would've spelled it right would be perfect
---
Yeaa
---
But when or how to the robots become enraged?
---
Yee, no
---
It could use some balancing but I like the concept
---
What happened?
---
I never notice they left footprints, how would that be helpful? I‚Äôm curious 
---
You just have bad luck but you'll get a new one soon probably 
---
UoU
---
You can hear the Carl super on the end screen 
---
This is not how it works tho, you can't post "daily content" or you'll run out of content, and everyone is asking for stuff like stopping teaming and more but it's not as easy as it sounds or maybe they don't even want to change something, it's their game so they'll end up designing it how it's meant to be played

There's your answer

GEDI-KOR, who's that?
---
Disfigure-blank
---
But there will always be new brawlers added. It should be at either 500, 700, or 1000 on a brawler imo
---
The real problem is that no one knows how to deal with shelly. Shelly is really good early game, but as you go up in trophies, shelly's usage rate plummets.
---
Nice map
---
If the game was balanced based on high skill high reward, then only high skill brawlers would be viable in the meta. Think about other games like clash royale or league of legends. Just because something takes less skill doesn‚Äôt mean it must be worse than something that takes more skill. They should both be equally as competitive when played at their best. Easier said than done though.

They should have Global Tournaments in Brawl Stars for showdown

I got Carl after opening about 30 boxes, why don't you give me the legendaries supercell? Whyyyyyyyyy???!?!?!?!

0.1632 means I have opened hundred upon hundreds and still nothing, why are you punishing me like this?

Go to the main page of the subreddit and click the three dots on the top right. After that select "Change User Flair" and choose your favorite character

i agree he should stay more mysterious and cool rather than a goofy villain man, but at least he sticks with the goofy vibe of the game ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

Interesting method! I‚Äôve had some skin idea before, but I was never able to draw well enough to make them look right. I may try something like this in the future.

idk about the game files, but the skin is from [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/ayzdvw/poco_skin_concept_farmer_poco/?st=JTN88I0P&amp;sh=62c82d63)

This can be equipped on any brawler (KIND of like star levels on cr)

Idk what to do woth loaded rico and golden barley

Thx

No he's kinda right, star bullets are pretty fitting for Rockstar Colt, they fit perfectly with the skin.

And why the hell would you walk towards your death? Based on your response, it seems like you‚Äôre playing crow like bull eh. No wonder you‚Äôre whining for crow buffs mate.
---
this has been reposted quite a few times

I'm done

It would be neither. The terms nerf and buff are used for damage, health, and reload.
---
Happens all the time. Spinning in circles is the ‚Äúwant to team?‚Äù signal.
---
Explain it to me too 
---
Why?
---
Well I dont car if it works out or not, It's my art so I get to draw however I want. your not the one putting hours into making something the way you like just to have people talk bad about. I'm greatful for critique and tips in my art but if your saying stuff like "the whole things wrong" just leave, don't vote and don't comment simple as that.

You had that in cavern churn with throwers before carl

This post was made by screenshot

wont make him viable again. 
---
not a bad idea, i don‚Äôt really care tbh as long as they bring it back
---
not only did it not have teamers but it was so fun in general, i understand their reasoning for removing it but i think there‚Äôs a much better solution (like this) than just removing it
---
it‚Äôs like removing showdown to fix the problem of teamers, like yeah it would work but there‚Äôs probably a better solution
---
What?

Holy Shi- that's a huge syringe!

how is it a glitch? what is supposed to happen?

The map is bigger in Siege, so that may be the reason

it would be great if they put missions

Lmao when your 3k+ trophys and the best character you have is Carl (by rarity)
---
Piper looks like satsuki kiriyuin from kill la kill
---
That was actually almost exactly what I was thinking! =D 
---
The only other thing is that he rides a rat and rams his enemies when caught by his rope.
---
He also throws his rope, like barley or dynamike and rams trough walls.

That wasn't the point.......Crow is decent so don't worry about him \[Crow\] just yet. I think nerfing Pam is more important than buffing Crow

He is actually smiling behind his sadness

It's when they do the coding incorrectly to try and get colours.

Lol exactly

that looks pretty good actually&gt;!!&lt;

You have to say the club correctly, please
---
I literally have 325/150 power points on bull because i never play him
---
1/3 of the migos for reference
---
Lol yeah carl super is op.. but I think his main is too weak
---
I know the other people have also said it, but 20 people on a map made for 6 people would be an absolute insane cluster fuck
---
Imagine the amount of time you would be seeing the brawl stars star spinning.
---
Maybe when people stop posting annoying posts like this
---
 Can confirm: 5.8 k trophies and my best character is piper (only epic)
---
Lol no. Simply, all of these names are names for what the Brawlers are called in the game files. Trickshot is rico, shaman is Nita, and so on. Obviously, Rico was gonna be a girl, so was Brock but they got changed, as shown in this image. Brock is also called RocketGirl in game files.
---
His star power is fine and actually suits him Perfectly. There‚Äôs no need for a different one.

‡ºº ‚Å∞ œâ ‚Å∞ ‡ºΩ cute!

We all make mistakes sometimes. And some people are just complete trainwrecks

I don't have a photoshop app. It's not much but it's honest work
---
It‚Äôs stocks you pleb! This spike went to Harvard and graduated sumacacti honours and he so he didn‚Äôt have to hustle like other basic brawler drop outs, he got hired by a top financial firm Penny Incorporated and he‚Äôs so baller now he just fat stacks and watch those arrows go up up up!
---
Opinion noted but I don't think these posts has reached annoying yet at most, repetitive.
---
Buff is stronger/more agile. It's based on a characters stats not on your opinion on how they look
---
Dang those jukes though. This is why I love Mike's star power.

Have no fear Mortis is here!

Just say idea. Reddit isn‚Äôt for making petition forms but yeah, I agree with this. 
---
He's good only against afks. A shelly/piper/pam/bull can smack your ass while only getting 650-1600 damage. 
---
I like how you cut the scene so he's like "yea ik" 
---
He's the OB
---
Poco wasn‚Äôt the only one you know (points spike)

He has an 8 tile range lol just stay far away from them. Not very hard

5000 would be better!

I disagree it can actually be a good strategy if you throw the ball at water when you are down teammates you can stop a chance of scoring for a bit. I like it personally 
---
Rly? Wow that‚Äôs like really good then. I‚Äôm not really that hyped up for crow if I end up getting him as I heard he needs a major buff
---
Dunno Dont care.

He underestimated the power of the hat

Just remember to credit the person next time or at least say it‚Äôs not by you.

Yes I‚Äôve killed b(itch)ull before a Leon

Same was mine when I got gene...... And now it's 0.0432% thought I don't have any legendary at 6.7k trophies
---
He wasn‚Äôt lagging but ok
---
OG, mini marley... Sorry bro
---
So do it now.Are you mad to me?
---
Is the chance of getting power points the same as getting a legendary brawler?
---
He has 18 brawlers.

Oops I meant to write 3000 trophies instead of 300 trophies, my bad

it just works
---
He is perfectly balanced bro..... The one who never faced crow, never used crow..... Is now saying buff crow..... Is that a trend
---
Tell me that it isn't real pls, I lost 120 trophies with dyna and it looked too much. But this...., Sorry
---
Yes and i hate it
---
I think we all want a skin like that for Piper, so many arts of this idea, one better than other, and yours seems one of the best, I hope Supercell bring this up to us.
---
Seems like a lot of work for something that you‚Äôll probably notice once or twice. 
---
For me, I don‚Äôt think twice about the background, unless it‚Äôs a color change, and in that case I still get used to it pretty quickly. 
---
I‚Äôd rather Supercell focus on bringing us more awesome game modes like Siege 
---
I have 0.1200 and nothing new.I have 16 brawlers and 4162 trophies now.
---
Is it 6 teams or 2 big teams (I would prefer 6 teams
---
People with low trophies always seem to get more lucky for some reason.
---
I hate playing aggro and being forced to grab gems,I usually use Spike for GG and my super traps carriers and like all my teammates are dead asf and I have to run away with 1k health and 6 gems
---
Bet you can't find the Leon in the background
---
Because tik tok is ‚Äútrending‚Äù 
---
I guess so
---
Just staying I would rather a new brawler over balance change
---
i mean , glitches were frequent in RR so alot of ppl  has max time on there
---
At lower trophy range, you can definitely grind to gain trophy. But at those guys trophy range at 700+, it is all skill.
---
At those levels, if you are bad, it doesn't matter how much you grind, you will lose more trophy than you gain.
---
And it is a fair correlation to correlate "amount of time played" with "skills". Majority of the players gets better as they play more. There is always exceptions, but in general I think that statement make sense
---
The middle bridge is blocked by the mushroom and crystal, making it pretty much useless
---
Its cause you have to try. I got leon and spike 500 easy
---
Some good fing food?
---
She isü•¥
---
My chance of getting legendary is .33 right now 
---
Agreed
---
Yeah they top notch the sounds in this game, and they sound very nice and fitting. The voice acting is amazing as well, for most of the Brawlers at least..._cough cough_ Poco _cough cough_
---
Yes I know he have a high damage but the fire rate will not be too high to balance that.
---
It will be a little bit lower than Colt.
---
Rework his star power pls
---
Carl would be so op on this map
---
Nah shes an anti vaxx mom
---
Man they really need to change the luck system in this game. F
---
When did it become the average? One of the tips that the game gives you on rhe loadig screen says that matchmaking is based on your brawler's trophy count that you are playing. Ik it's a bit outdated because they added total trophy count into the mix too, but please tell me if they are using averages now
---
a creature of the nightmares
---
Only mythics affect legendary rate 
---
Wait what?
---
How??
---
Can you send me a link to where a dev supported teaming?
---
Fam you switched the squares and it made me confused for a little bit lol
---
you could have made the simple attack of carl faster, and that the star power gave you the ability to do more damage in the return hits of the pickaxe =)
---
No repeat brawlers?
---
There are gonna be waves of dynas, barleys, brocks, anything with splash and long range. It would be madness
---
The star shelly skin is rewarded for playing in 2018

I already sent this farther down in the thread, but here you go. It's not a dev, but Ryan, I should've clarified that.

---
Its not random
---
It shows whoever LAST TOUCHED the brawler same with brawl balls self goaling

If u self goal, Whomever tpuched u last time will show up as if  they scored it 
---
This map will be unfair at the beginning and Dynamikes with Star Power can get the gems easily!
---
Tried playing Mike in solo showdown and yikes, its fucking retarded as someone that refuses to spin. Mike may have the rep as the most spin friendly brawler, but 80% of people are spinning at 300+ trophies anyways.
---
That's kinda true, but there still is better synergy.
---
It is more "average" than what the tip says. Especially when playing as a team. Not sure about your team, but they most likely were playing as a pre-made group of three which is why you have the absolutely out-of-place 210ish Trophy Darryl with the bit higher Gene.

As he escaped out from the cave, he was immediately sucked back into the depths of the darkness. He soon realized he was pulled by Tara and fallen right into Bo‚Äôs collection of land mines. Legend says that he is still stuck there like a Dynamike hit by a Frank super, _but still no one knows_.

I played 3 games of Robo Rumble, with 20 tickets each time. I had 17 brawl boxes to open, but after I opened some of them the counter would go down by two instead of one. So if it said I had 5 brawl boxes, I would open one and then it would say I had 3 brawl boxes. I opened around 10 boxes total. I was not paying close attention to my coin count, so I don't know if I got the contents of the boxes that disappeared, but it seems like I did not.
