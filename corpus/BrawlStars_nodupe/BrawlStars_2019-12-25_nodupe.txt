Getting star player in showdown
---
Just play rico and a bo with sp.trust me i've gotten my bo to 750 on that map without teaming
---
&gt;!Yes!&lt;
---
Same

Oh god, imagine all the ships about this.

I always thought it served as a "get your shit together" kind of gesture

Rico its ricochet 2.0 or the modern replacement of ricochet...
---
So it means that ricochet was trowed to the garbage....
---
Meaby ricochet hates rico...
---
Im just saying...
---
CUTE!
---
When you played before 2019 but don‚Äôt have supercell id
---
Hes so cute and angry lol
---
Not the right meme for this
---
How you can do the primo glitch or something i wanna know because I have only 6min can you do the  thing with me?
---
Why would I buy golden rico when I don't even like the skin in the first place? It's not even a good skin to me tbh
---
For your information bs is like 1 year or 1,5 if you playing beta
---
It hurts
---
meteors fix it in my opinion
---
You know it
---
Rosa dosent have a skin because she donated all of it to team trees
---
Maybe ricocchet is just piper's bodyguard not crush or lover.
---
Awesome wish I could do that
---
I can‚Äôt spail for shit
---
Happy cake day
---
k funny man
---
XD I mean that‚Äôs a mood
---
IS TIME TO SHTOP
---
Nothing special, probably the 4 legys and the 2 new brawlers.
---
Im with you it doesnt make any sense for a human like piper to get in love with a robot unless he/she is suffering from severe depression.
---
Go aheas downvote me i dont care!
---
I think its hard to just get her to rank 20 how did you do it?
---
Lol I meant a 2-2 draw
---
I've seen 0-0 and 1-1 draws before though
---
Hope you get em soon and merry christmas
---
Hi the person say k funny man
---
Yeah their old models actually looked decent, unlike Bo‚Äôs
---
Absolutely. He is a lot of fun to play
---
No it‚Äôs a rip off and you could save them on something else kairos made a video on it its not the best idea to buy a legendary too expensive
---
And mortis? üíî
---
Wasnt there already one, expect the star?
---
I did
---
You are LUCKY because you have 1 legendary at 10k.
---
Be thankful, many people struggle to get even 1 so don't complain
---
Yes but I put a tree
---
stop.
---
It should've been the star ON the tree, not the tree itself :)
---
Lol your rite

Aren't the piratr skins limited?

I mean I guess so

r/StolenPost
---
That was rico was on a team with that shelly, so nothing's wrong here
---
They were playing through friend list not club
---
How about free legendary brawler?
---
No
---
it's the best skin of him
---
Except it's literally not cheating. Supercell has said it's a strategy. I don't like teamers myself and **always** attack people trying to spin at me, but you can't just decide it's cheating because you don't like it.
---
Emotes have been in the game since the brawlidays update
---
Imagine giving time for your enemies to run since ur attack takes a long time to hit the ground.
---
-this comment was made by ricochet gang.

How do you even get in coach cory top plays

up! so possible, let's hype it up haha

You guys are getting brawlers?

It is, and I‚Äôm so mad that I didn‚Äôt get him last year.

Just sent a cossair colt to evacuate him from his 10 month mission near the graveyard

What did you get if you bought gold RicoChet in exchange for the remodel? Let me guess LR?

Wow.you cheated

Same for crow since i have spike

cocporn is the rarest

Dude wtf

*cocporn*
---
But still... their combined trophy count is less than half my total count, which is a significant difference and brings us to the exception clause of the latter half of my initial reply... We have a bonafide anomaly in the algorithms and it needs correction for all our collective sanity. We can all at least agree on that.
---
i don‚Äôt have the robo rumble time but i got star shelly so i guess i‚Äôm a sorta OG?
---
Im mithyc bruh
---
Lol that's really unfair
---
Pretty good ideas.
---
I loved the old one!
---
I would still play with popcorn rico
---
I love ur maps bro,they are always so unique amd allow for diverse conps and strategies.Keep it up!!
---
Nita and leon are siblings üòÄ
---
And now you have to remake Rico
---
i lost my old account with star shelly...
---
theres noting inherently wrong with teaming it just becomes extremely frustrating for people being teamed against. I dont play showdown a lot but if i saw someone teaming i would try to find someone else to team with so i have a equal chance. I wouldn't just try to solo because its "unethical" to team.

It was a template made by u/matiaz_ brawl, this guy add the meme and credit him already
---
I got crow pretty early on in the game and got Leon recently today and today I got spike + power point offer, but sadly not a single mythic. Although I have bibi
---
When things get bouncy. In the neighborhood. Who do you call? Colt.
---
Also F in the chat for our bois
---
What‚Äôs max addicted to?
---
Rico is like a Colt with bouncy bullets, faster reload, a chaining super, and less health. Also I have found that Colt's bullets are faster than Rico's and I need to aim farther ahead with Rico than with Colt.
---
not, apart from brawl talk. why? are tips too basic?

Well.... I mean.... I tried it on the other hand and it turned out worse than that. I mean its still good in my opinion

Ya know, bots can't be "killed"

Is Rico but with Ricochet‚Äôs hat

Well yes but it‚Äôs still enjoyable to watch

And on my mini account I still use Rico

Yea, like a noose

?

Ok

Please stop showing off i didnt get anything from those free gifts all i want is just any starpower or brawler

Personally, I tried it in gem grab, rushed in, got all 10 gems and then survived by charging up the super and running away. I lived on about 50hp with the star power! üòÖ
---
Imagine needing a star power to charge your super without attacking.
---
/This post was made by the Darryl gang/
---
That's true, but it just feels so open and empty when all those Meteorites have landed, this used to be a map where you could finally outshine with Brawlers like Bull, since there aren't a lot of maps with a lot of bushes anymore.

There's a good chance this is unique! I checked 87,975,894 image posts and didn't find a close match

Wait, Coach Flapjack? DUDE I GOT MATCHED UP WITH THAT GUY IN GAME HE HAD 20K TROPHIES. I WAS PLAYING WITH THE FIRST GUY TO SHIP PIPER AND RKCO DJENMEKTYHRMMEJEK
---
He has two left hands
---
That's theoretical. From my experience, I genuinely have seen many p2w just suk at the game at higher trophies. Note higher trophies= 300-500
---
You're bad content

Me, template belongs to u/Matiaz_brawl
---
How long did that take?
---
No it is, template belongs to u/Matiaz brawl
---
i'm missing 4 brawlers at 12k bea, max, leon and sandy
---
Colt was my first brawler to 500 trophies but he‚Äôs only power level 7. I can‚Äôt wait to get either of his star powers! At least bull is still pretty good despite the nerf...
---
Piper + Shiba Nita + The movie "IT" = the art
---
on paul's twitter
---
He is the messiah
---
the bug makes it so that even if you score on the right side it always results in a draw, so you wouldn't have won anyway
---
Yeah, he‚Äôs actually surprisingly underused. Hard rock mine (gem grab) is a really great map for him if you get into the enemies row of bushes.
---
Yea Crow is my waifu
---
What's the bug here?
---
WHAT
---
 [u/Nate1Won](https://www.reddit.com/user/Nate1Won/)

i mean i think the "we're both low lets not shoot each other" teaming is good to get out of a tricky situation, but targeting someone together is a bitch move
---
It was there before, its hard to notice though.
---
I love it! As always ;)
---
WoW very cool fanart!üëçüëçüëç
---
Wrong flair sorry.
---
tfw no big titty bee gf
---
I‚Äôll try that! Might as well start grinding because he‚Äôs only rank 13 on my account....
---
This is way too cute ;-;
---
Did you bought them in the shop because sandy,crow and max are in the shop
---
That's so nice of you brother!
---
He thinks that the game has given only 2 tokens by winning, but that's bc he only has 2 left
---
Not only legendary.
---
*WHEEEZE!!!*
---
Yes maybe, but i lost the match anyways
---
He said 'wrong flair'
---
Congrats
---
the next brawler will probably have a reload booster
---
For all of you who think I stole it. The TEMPLATE belongs to u/Matiaz_brawl and NOT that meme!

Removed - DO NOT SUBMIT POSTS WITH TITLES IN ALL CAPS. CAPS LOCK IS CRUISE CONTROL FOR COOL

Good. More satisfying that letting him die in the poison.
---
well done

Yeah I hear that, but I thought it suited the character style a lot more, the version is much better though
---
How do u made this white stripe in 
---
"There's no Jessie without a Pam"?
---
they are not the same. and calling something a "ripoff" when it managed to get into the game is pretty stupid, dont you think?
---
Not as cursed as the comments I'll make eventually on other posts, keep your eyes peeled (no, not literally) and yeah..
---
thnx
---
ryan has a creator code?
---
Crow, sandy is just boring
---
Most of them are p2w so they get benefits.
---
Actually i have much less problem with lonestar then with takedown simply being lone star is much more fair instead of getting powercubes and hoping not to get murdered
---
Removed - Your post is too short, please expand on your title.

1- Thanks!
---
2- A special clan box, that everyone who participated gets, and the better you do, the greater the rewards.

3- Your clan would probably need 50+ active players who are over 5k to participate, meaning it‚Äôd be mid/late game.

Chief Pekka said that he wanted to create a map similar to outlaw camp to give OG players some taste of nostalgia

Pam doesn't have skin because she spent all her money for costumes for Jessie

Piper then suddenly blows up, leaving behind a grosteque mess behind, as well as the life form that Rico always wanted to create and raise wi-

Aaaaahhh thats hot

Its bot shltpost I didn't got my tokens. Evden Tho I had more.

For me it costs 27 wtf

Not the players we thought of...

I mean, with a comment like that, what were you expecting? Sportaflop?

Nice

Much respect

Ayyyy! I know this...Poco! Very cool person to hang out with ;)

There isn't one anymore dumbass

That face reminded me of the face Dio made when he said "Kono Dio da!"

He ain't fat, just big boned
---
but your cousin will also get older and also get better right? Everyone is different but if you take all of them in average than you will see that more experience = more skill. and im a college student and i dont have that much money either but i work at the weekends and spend some money on games that i genuinely like.
---
take a look at her attack animation, it comes from her body, not the weapon itself, the same as 8-bit, Rico, etc. Please share this so they can fix it tbh
---
Road rage, cuz i have it

When colt‚Äôs right brow is on his bandana

Sandy doesn't have skin because he is too lazy to get some

yup.

Nice you got max
---
Of course, but when it happens...
---
I always have a headache when i play Lonestar

I met the same people too just score no need to spin intensely
---
It's just weather in winter in my country...
---
Surr
---
r/shittybrawlstars approves your ¬´¬†jerkery¬†¬ª
---
Yes but like 70% of players with 10k+ have starshelly
---
Or maybe four leaves clover is better for name?
---
Most of people (myself included) didn't got the chance to bought them, so now we can get them. The game needs money to keep running soo
---
Yeah, I opened a new account in hopes of getting a legendary or epic brawler. Anyways, thank you.
---
This actually beeing post alot
---
Can I ask what motivated to push that much ? I pretty much just stopped after reaching the end of trophy road. Just play casually here and there now.
---
What do you mean
---
No you mean see Tymek's trophies?
---
Idk
---
I push my piper in brawl ball from 500 to 600, so, i think it depends on the maps as well
---
Fortnite bad minecraft good
---
Amazing
---
Add some jump pads and just call it lucky landing
---
RICOCHET IS BACK TO BRAWL STARS! Yeah!

Or they will never do that bacause you wrote SUPEECELL.

Like Snake Prairie is all about having better reactions and hoping that you won't ve bursted by shelly's super

6k is nothing

i think tgats the reason too, although it shouldnt be the reason, as both cost 700gems without discount
---
power points should have been on the fourth day but something broke
---
Woke up this Christmas morning expecting atleast something, but all i got was 50 free token doublers from the daily shop.....
---
disappointed
---
Dang I should've done that
---
Fair enough, but this wasn't the way to fix it, this map is way too small and too many walls for meteors to be dropping, idk if that's the right way to describe it but... you get the point. 
---
I think they removed this map earlier for a reason, but now that it is back it should serve it's purpose and that is to make it easier for close range brawlers.
---
Throwers will be annoying in any map, except maybe open maps. 
---
Meteors on this map is just a little too much imo.
---
they said until 24th of december

That jessie is me

I hope I can finally get both of Leon‚Äôs Star Powers from boxes before invisaheals inevitable nerf

quality autoaim
---
They will when new brawler is released
---
I kinda agree with that maybe they should make it angry robo make a new affect to the game or just remove carven churn
---
The spirit of christmas. Hope you get back all your lost trophies!! Please share your friends' usernames as well, if I get matched against you guys in future I'm going to give you a free win as well.
---
I wish it did, but teamers will always be teamers
---
I think everyone should be our team mates so no one could kill each other and attacking the boss would slowly charge the super just like in the boss fight
---
This has been done before
---
Looking forward!
---
#***ORA***
---
Yeah but for me it opens up more opportunities for other brawlers to fight in cavern churn other than your traditional shotgun + throwers and other than that you are at a huge disadvantage.
---
The frank is stoopid
---
Agreed
---
F
---
Because that's who I am..
---
There are some people living 1 step ahead, and there are people like these that are 100 steps ahead

Try reinstalling your game

She must be fat
---
Ok, watched it, I have questions 1. Why was there a guy being spanked an 2. Why was there a guy who put a diamond in soup. I live under big rock , sry
---
Ngl I like this map more in heist.
---
She is a littel bit
---
Nop
---
Sure, go ahead
---
Im not going to spend hundreds of dollars on a mobile game just to be able to play a single brawler. As much as I like playing this game, i won't support companies that add luck based gameplay mechanics (also called gambling) into games designed towards a younger audience of players.
---
Opening boxes is stimulating the same region in your brain that gets stimulated when gambling. Since children don't understand how gambling works they get easily manipulated into spending their parents money. 
---
Of course i understand that supercell needs to make money to be able to run these online games and provide servers for us, but literally adding GAMBLING in a childrens game is disgusting and wrong on so many levels. 
---
Supercell is making MILLIONS of dollars every single day with their games, they won't run dry on money any time soon. So me not supporting them isn't going to hurt them at all. 
---
if you want to read more about how much Supercell really makes with these games, [HERE](https://thehustle.co/the-company-who-made-clash-of-clans-is-worth-more-than-evernote-eventbrite-and-Buzzfeed-combined) is an article about exactly that
---
I got spike, Sandy and max in shop, it's propably depended on which legendaries you have... Good idea supercell give us all legendaries and make Sandy cost the most for no reason!
---
I literally said that on a video like 5 minutes ago
---
Tara has a scarf like Gene. I would put her in one other tier. Maybe "fullface" with Eeeeel primooooo
---
the present didn't wanted to leave your team xD
---
I only got piper and bibi in one day ; C
---
Wait, that's free real estate
---
I mean...
---
It's still a good offer
---
This post is a mess.
---
Seems a bit overpowered, 1.5k damage with an area effect with slowness seems a bit unfair, maybe only the super causes slowness for balancing reasons?
---
Yeah but since Sandy is the newer brawler and more players got Crow than Sandy, his offer is less. I bought Crow tho and couldn't be much happier, now I just want Leon, those two always looked so fun, never played with them and Crow is wow :]
---
if you really like crow, go for it then! you should only save gems if you like limited skins and stuff, otherwise getting a legendary brawler is worth it (except for sandy, he's way too expensive atm)
---
You must be humble in defeat and humble in victory!
---
Try deleting and reinstalling the app
---
Oh shut up. This is a recurring issue for players and they should at least bother to fix it or something
---
this is enough to make a grown man cry. merry christmas
---
I just lost some brain cells looking at this
---
Yes I played defensive
---
I tried it's only possible with jessie penny and pam
---
No. We expect the problem to be fixed after an update or 2. And did you read the title SC lied to OP.
---
Penny Wise has taken full control of her :(
---
but this happens in every game that have a mode like lonestar, stolen kills is normal
---
You probably went over 3100 then dropped three.
---
thank you!! it is my first art
---
 Not a bug 
---
That mean you were 3100 then you lost trophies and became 3097.
---
You are not just Santa, you are a true hero

B*ITCH I EARNED THOSE GEMS AS AN F2P I WILL USE LOADED RICO WITH PRIDE FOREVER

Mecah gold xd xd i also want a dragon of that color

I see SF a lot. I see IX | (username) but they are from SSG for some reason
---
I'm guessing he assumed it because there are alot of people who steal art for karma and make crappy memes. I don't think that's the case here but it could easily be.
---
Ah damn forgot dragon knight Jessie
---
And the enemy is always a Shelly with a super of a bib that originally gave up but after seeing our toxic teammate still spinning with the ball, she knocks the toxic guy away
---
This is not a matchmaking mistake.
---
The El Primo played with the Shelly in a pre-made team, they are in game friends and decided to play together. Be angry at the El Primo for bringing the Shelly in a 500 trophy match. You are the unlucky random.

I fucking love him and his damn teammates

And that's a FACT

Same problem man
---
I‚Äôm so glad I found this I wanted to close reddit and do something else but I have him now

Wouldn't work since Shelly could super to clear the middle and gain more time outside the poison...

I dont think we'll get banned already 5 of us using it for 1 week. Also I notice other people using it so it's just levelling the play ground
---
Frank said they have 0 plans to do anything with it
---
Of huck
---
Im sorry, but no Thiccochet, no karma
---
What kind of bull shit is this? Why the fuck would they encourage not attacking each other. It isn't boss fight ffs.
---
Oh okay
---
That's just lag
---
And plus when a new brawler comes out it'll be easyer to get
---
... It confused me
---
I thought I was playing bounty then realised that map had been removed a long time ago
---
It was kinda lame but at least you got the gems and coins
---
Oh my goooooooooooood fuck you if you can fix something that fast why you even playing this game. Why dont you create your own game to watch someone complaining about every brocken thing
---
Me too bro!
---
*sigh* Whatever...
---
Graveyard shift replace:Lone star and takedown. 
---
Takedown and lonestar are only able to play in friendly game (cuz most hated)
---
No events rotating every mode is permanent like brawl ball with its own slot
---
Present plunde now rename to capture the flag and
---
Presents are repleaced with flags 
---
Also the game mode is permenent
---
I feel like if they just make it where the boss charges your super it would change up the mode a lot and make more brawlers viable.
---
I have his 2 skins so i keep using those

When u have just finished a 4 hour grind in brawl ball

Wtf

Rico got all the thiccs
---
Since Jessie‚Äôs shots can bounce off others, when she shoots the boss, it bounces to other players. And jessies always attempt to shoot a bull and hope the shot bounces off to the boss
---
Nita and spike kawaii
---
It says "unlocked"
---
It doesn't specify HOW it is unlocked
---
So ya technically barley comes with free skin when unlocked through supercell ID
---
Jessie can hurt the Boss and other Players at the same time with her main attack.
---
I think I‚Äôve seen them once, but I‚Äôm not sure
---
I should have been more clear. LAN generally refers to ethernet but it can also refer to wifi - WLAN. Right now you can't have friendly games with people next to you over wifi which is what I want. You can't have true offline games with bots either though and  you can even get lag in them.

PiperxRico is my OTP

Dude they must be so happy. I hope somebody repays you somehow. Again...respect for you man üëä

Why do the edgy ones always have crow flairs

You WHAT

Crow's dagger does more damage than the poison tick so that wouldn't work...
---
3 braincells are gone

does thatmean if iunlock mortis i get him with and without a hat? or do i pay gems for it?
---
Thanks
---
Nope,there in the reddit exist one that got 13 second to win the match
---
Yeah thats what i thought you discrace
---
Then why bring up why they dont have a lot of upvotes? Lol.
---
And downvoted my reply?

How can you be level one and max at the same time üòÇ

What is a powerpoint skin?

Right

Beeutiful!

Its Leon with nita collors

I am so confused what is this

Because Reddit has a hate boner for Emojis. They almost always get downvoted unless you're in a sub specifically for them.

hehe cool than you used my meme but dont forgot to credit me!
---
What the actual fuck
---
What about Rico and the Ricochet skin. If they were unlocked yesterday to next week, they had a free skin when unlocked.
---
Just delete this shit mode.
---
that's not how you use the template lmao
---
Even numbers are star and not even numbers are bandites
---
So you instantly downvote me for maybe giving another reason why? I think there‚Äôs more reason to believe that people dont their art, as opposed to emoji‚Äôs in the title. You‚Äôre being irrational.
---
thanks!!! (The meme template is actully my}

he didn't understand the irony in the post and corrected it

Russkie vpered

Don't talk to him,hi's not a real gamer
---
Thank you for this. I never got all the hate for attacking other players in a competitive game. They‚Äôre not your teammates, and it‚Äôs literally why the boss shield mechanic exists
---
Why

I wonder how the dev's will live off 5 dollars.

OMG

These are all cute! I see this as an absolute win!

Last two days are nothing

ARE MY EYES DECIEVING ME OR IS THAT REALLY 91K STAR POINTS!?!?!?!?!?

He need damage or reloading speed but not the range buff. He is fast enough.
---
That Shelly would have killed us all, but somehow I released my head on time
---
I love it... Simply love it!
---
No one really likes the original one
---
Hey so I need help choosing to buy two brawlers either max or crow which one should I get
---
U get the hat for free u click on mortis in brawlers and change his skin to the top hat mortis and there u go TADA
---
Also duo showdown should be removed for the same reasons. The only problem in 3vs3 are the randoms but you can easily avoid it.

Thats your opinion and I respect that. I dont hate solo gamemodes (except Takedown, I PERSONALLY hate takedown) but I think that things are a little bit too random to be competitive. Im fine with whatever strategy people use (camping, teaming.... I dont care). Its the same with the map "Minecart Mandness" : the randomness ruins the competitive spirit of power play

Thats not the problem, you still lose in a 3vs3 if you have an afk player

NEVER

---
Im a leon what ya expect
---
Exactly, all the new maps seemed kinda identical and alike to each other, which most of them were boring to play on. What I wanted to do is bring something from Beta to the modern world of brawl stars; in this case, this is Outlaw Camp; this was to give OG players a nostalgic feeling of playing on an old map again.

U can only do bo right now?

Good memories

but dragons don't exist
---
I agree about Takedown (as currently is), the robot's seemingly random shields and charging really annoy me and double agree on Minecart Madness. Hands down the worst map in the game, even more so than Shelly Invasion or Camper Churn. 
---
I just don't feel like the randomness in spawn points in SD ruins the competitive spirit, since your success is still defined 90% by your own ability and since, honestly, randoms are actually pretty hard to avoid.
---
If you enter with friends or through the new Look for a Team function, it's not so bad, sure, but there's still a good amount of unpredictability involved in who your teammates and enemies are because matchmaking is... well, flawed at best, as we know. 
---
At least in SD I'm in control of my own results ;)
---
That is normal when you have no friends
---
Dude, 3 epics, no mythic and legendaries on 10700
---
Darryl on a gorgeous cask of amazing scotch.
---
Yes, I love the sound of that ‚ù§‚ù§
---
I have the exact same problem and I use an s10+ too. From what I've seen there are some people who are also having lag issues after the recent update on BS that don't use a s10 though.
---
I woke up at 10 lol...Btw my present was fake airpods xD. Theyre not bad tho.
---
O well that‚Äôs really interesting
---
It‚Äôs STILL ruining the game mode
---
Why not use search at least
---
This isnt a skin. It is Rico
---
Maybe i score my own goal in Brawl ball but i don't sray afk
---
Speed run the whole thing and none them should respawn

Them I guess something is wrong with your phone.

Cringe

And?

(I didn't threw last second)

Lucky guy. I can unlock 5 starpowers, Bea and Max at 14000 trophies.
---
repost
---
Shelley got a free skin if u got her in 2018
---
but isnt shelly and colt together?
---
No, the objective is to do more damage to the boss than other players.  Other players can't do damage to the boss if they're dead.  You can't just make up up your own idea of how the game should be played and its objective.  Granted some people focus too much on killing other players.
---
Can i add you
---
#HOW DARE YOU
---
looks like el primo one
---
Great job! I like open maps. Would be cool to play here. I made a map called OutPLAY Oasis so I also find this funny :D
---
I dunno, can you? :D
---
now that makes sense
---
At 12k

Ahahah, lukiebear is da beat

In the line friends video we can see Colt kissing Piper

Bruh howwww

Yea ^^"

I‚Äôve had 4 MegaJessies in a row (I play only one ticket per big game event just for the star token)
---
The current max icon is like a toaster head
---
Leon and max
---
well  red (max is red) on red(mytihics have red backround) doesn t look s good so he/she put another color
---
Colts magnum special already makes his bullets go faster
---
Bro this is like 700 gems, I only have 600 is better buy leon and wait for another offer?
---
This will make teaming
---
I sent it:/
---
Omg thats so true, km 17k and have 29 brawlers
---
ü§®

Jk it whas 8 k but STILL COMMON

Ok then sandy and some megas or leon with mega boxes
---
Not agreed
---
Me: Darryl on a barryl

Same mate
---
I can let you know that you aren‚Äôt unlucky just that your friends have crazy luck. Some people don‚Äôt have legendaries and are at 15k trophies.
---
Excellent
---
1-it has no one tile gaps and that's great
---
2-we don't have an oasis them in showdown so use the desert, wasteland or mortuary theme instead
---
3-it's a very good map that needs few polishing to be a great map

and so is you

I am spike

Bro what the fuck keep it pg rated

I am so happy and feels lucky when I got Max today, but I am not so happy now. Still, Santa visited me too.
---
Lol I got every single gift
---
Why NSFW?
---
if you want a flair go to the sub, tap on your profile and click change user flair
---
Limited
---
Definitely Leon, I have both and the extra cost is not worth it. He is really easy to push in solo modes like sd and lone star so I highly recommend getting him (Sandy is too but he is too expensive imo).
---
Still, free skin.
---
I thought meme will be about bea ‡≤†_ ñ‡≤†
---
Ah I see ur a man of culture aswell

Scrappy Cage

max's icon is just zoomed this is why it looks wierd and out of place

her face is chub

Dear fellow redditor:
---
Your commentary was so rude! This little poor creature is just pissed because he wasn't able to get such a extraordinary brawler. You could just have discussed with him. You didn't needed to destroy him. But you should marry me.
---
Sincerely, another guy who also has Crow.
---
Pretty epic get it because max is epic

Jelly. Can I have your luck please

I saved 0 boxes, but there was a free box in the shop and i got bea out of it!
---
The original portrait has yellow spikes on her cheeks while the in-game model has them at the ears. It ruins the whole thing for me.
---
I know it‚Äôs not much but I have been playing since global release and still no legendary
---
She has the big square head at da bottom
---
I think what he meant was normally, Dyanamike‚Äôs beard is really spiky, but in this skin, it‚Äôs less spiky. I‚Äôm not sure what exactly he meant by ‚Äòcuffed‚Äô, but that‚Äôs what I noticed. Hope this helped!
---
Perhaps, but every match I‚Äôve had has been close to my total trophies and not a lot of them weren‚Äôt close in brawler trophies.
---
This is one of the most cutest things i've ever see
---
Bruh... That's lame.
---
sandy is already sleepy , but this one is more sleepy cuz he wears pyjamas, so this is why the skin names "sleepy sandy"
---
Well at least she looks like a girl and not some
---
Kind of drugged up el primo. Imo Supercell should just hire Gedi for all their art.
---
Hope to find some *gems* tonight
