But then how will you experience the Soulcrushing sadness of opening a minimal reward box 35 times in a row.....?

---
*\*laughs in dashingly handsome\**
---
oh okay, but if the 3d models were made by him, then it'd be better. cause he made the concepts. that's all i could say
---
probably the worst map ive ever seen, how does it have 600 upvotes, do people actually think this would be fun 2 play on?
---
Agreed. Being able to donate power points would be awesome, as well as challenges.
---
5v5 sounds lit
---
Thanks! I'm planning to make another trampoline park map with a similar concept.
---
I always felt like Rico was too weak, he has barely no health and his attack is weak.
---

---
My first super rara and its on rank 9 yet, while others are 14+.
---
Yeah he‚Äôs so good
---
I pull Robo away from the turret. And sometimes enemies into the turret's range. It's fun.
---
Wild West was the most golden of times. I would buy a permanent Wild West theme option ASAP, no questions asked.
---
soon after, ricos and dynamikes start taking over the game
---
Like how you‚Äôll spawn next to an enemy on the sides
---
Can‚Äôt believe they just unlocked spike and crow at 2k trophies! Unacceptable 
---
Always go on throwers,never go on tanks
---
EELLLLL PRIIIIIMMMOOOOOOOO!!!!!! Remodel
---
The only problem i see with this map is that it‚Äôs too cramped, and so potentially you won‚Äôt get a win because of skill but because of where you spawned and the fact that the middle brawler took the jump pad towards you.
---
However I really like the idea behind the map and the artistic mind behind the design!
---
More open areas would be very beneficial
---
It is always like that with Brock. It sucks!!
---
[removed]
---
xD
---
Yeah!
---
Oh yeah let me just fire my shotgun‚Äî 21 musketeer ammo thingys come out of one musket
---
This I would buy for like 300 gems
---
It was funny is all, your english is fine
---
He needs a mask
---
Lol
---
I personally don‚Äôt like it because it seems that there are always 8 people left when the gas is making the map small. But glad you guys like it!
---
You rely in other humans for 3v3, no thanks.
---
F
---
Ummm I think he means come up with a new brawler and you know make up some stats?
---
Wow... just wow
---
24 hours is way too long; the only thing Supercell will be finding themselves is that they‚Äôre business is dying

Indeed sir, indeed.

What?

I'm afraid of misclicking on this button lol

U know you can reply right?

It‚Äôs so cute I want it

no hes still weak

still pretty weak lol

This map actually looks decently functional

Pretty much I completely agree with the other guy and I think you lost the argument

I don't know what you guys are talking about.  Jessie is my favorite character and this game mode rocks! lol

There is standing SOLO SHOWDOWN IDIOT
---
Glad you enjoyed it!
---
Reached that milestone today,it helped cause im savin boxes and it gave me the gold necessary to upgrade my brawler
---
I like it but if u count,there are only 8 spawns
---
Yes people get frustrated but those people are more skilled than the  low trophy people with star powers, is what I am trying to say. The skill matters more than the a level advantage IMO. So eventually the low level but skilled players will upgrade their brawlers and move past the low skilled people. In the long run it all works out 
---
Imagine not being able to heal after killing an enemy- This post was made by the Mortis Gang

Doubt it will need that the game is losing players every month. It's gone down in the charts too. Seems like people cant stand the issues and imbalance 
---
Good idea but it should only apply to the showdown  game mode 
---
**Time to abuse Darryl‚Äôs water physics**
---
I‚Äôm in the same boat my friend. Hang in there. He‚Äôll eventually pop up.
---
You ever heard of this game mode called showdown
---
&gt;White crow is getting a remodel
---
How do you know?
---
Ive seen teir list memes on here before cmon
---
Supercell should watch a few (10-20) random showdown games and if there‚Äôs teaming they should give temporary but serious bans like 1-2 weeks. That would reduce teaming. #stopthespin
---
Maybe get a new phone? Other than that I don't know to be honest

Gedi, did you apply for the position yet?

IN THE LOADINGSCREEN IS STAYING: SOLO SHOWDOWN
---
He literally took Rico's super to the face XD
---
I agree. If you‚Äôre not going to hire him. Just pay him for his concepts and bloody well implement them. 
---
No, but woosh is woooosh that happens in other reddits
---
or you go into the plus button to add someone and create a code for a team, just share the code with him, and then you are in the same team... add him from there
---
This would be great for a 10 on ten death match game mode, where you basically kill everybody on the opposing team you can, but without  power cubes

Watching 10 replays/live games won‚Äôt take a long time.

"Eventually" and "in the long run" ledge on the hope that those whom do get unfairly matched will play and put up with the game long enough to stick around for it.  Also doesn't address the people who aren't more skilled. 
---
What a blitz, right? That's why I confused why did he decide to betray us lol.
---
I spin whenever I kill someone who‚Äôs been chasing me nonstop. Like REALLY spin. No bans for that thx
---
What is that? I'm a Semi new player :p
---
Life Leech should be considered as an event, although even then, it still didn‚Äôt stop teaming from happening. 
---
Banning a player momentarily is a method many, and I mean Many, online player games use. MOBAs, FPS, And others use it. It lowers the chances teaming from happening if you attempted to cheat, because that‚Äôs what teaming is, cheating. It works for plenty of games, so I don‚Äôt see a reason why a game like Brawl Stars shouldn‚Äôt have a ban for cheating such as teaming. If you Team, you get banned momentarily. What‚Äôs the lesson? Don‚Äôt cheat. 
---
Although, if they can come up with a solution to teaming, then I am completely supportive of that idea. Quick games doesn‚Äôt necessarily end teaming, in fact, it just makes it easier to team, if, we are talking about an increased toxic gas speed.

Supercell is to stuck up to take good skin suggestions into the game
---
There is nothing wrong with that matchmaking 
---
Gold skins would be cool.... emotes would probably create more teaming tho, like one emote would signify teaming and such, much better understood than spinning. 
---

Well obviously I am, and am enjoying the game. I believe the current system is much worse for "unfairness" due to the RNG on pl.

I made the likes go from 2.5 to 2.6k I feel special 
---
Just like to let you know you don‚Äôt have to leave the country for exiting bucket list adventures. 
---
This comment section gets worse the deeper you go into it
---
It was an old game modifier like the healing mushrooms that they took away a couple updates ago. You would constantly be losing life and the only way to get health would by to shoot or kill another player, which was effective in reducing teaming 
---
We can use (s)he too.
---
This should be the 5000 throphys skin
---
He can still do the creative part. Ideas and scratch
---
Consider to say (s)he also.
---
Yeah i was thinking of mentioning that in the title. It would be very useful if supercell did rhat, but then u wouldnt know if ur battery was low. :/
---
Assassin gang
---
There are literally only 2 maps that have all bushes. And there are like 30 maps in the game.
---
Definateley not
---
The thing is supercell isn't going to attempt to fix something that they've gone on the record of accepting it as part of game strategy.
---
I pushed 200 trophies yesterday in cavern churn with Shelly. Bull and Rico. Take advantage of the maps rather than complaining. 
---
Well maybe the moment you get to the in/loss screen get pinged
---
i spin with anyone(while i'm bull), then i progressively spin closer to gain their trust, then i double them down.
---
Yey Xd
---
Then he could‚Äôve replied and said that
---
They will start taking it seriously when players start leaving the game because of teaming. 
---
Yeah nevermind I agree. Just played as Bull on Snake Prairie with a Shelly and Spike. We were against a Penny, Barly, and a Piper. Guess who won lol
---
Didn't somebody already do this? I might be wrong though...

Yah now get to 7 k having to push all your brawlers to rank 20 ;-;
---
I mean his hitboxes are very disjointed and he can pretty much hit around corners and actually chase you down hit you three times heal almost full health then get kill you and then need only two hits to get his super again
---
Lmao
---
Oh shoot Steve Irwin is getting his own brawler?
---
I don't think we can add you just based on your name... It would have to be a player code.
---
I see this a lot too. I think that it‚Äôs that people will go after easy kills, and focus on harder opponents later. That‚Äôs weird though, because I‚Äôve had situations where there‚Äôs an el primo in a corner between me and another brawler that isn‚Äôt heavy weight, and I‚Äôm not heavy weight. Primo has 8 and we both have one. THE OTGER BRAWLER GOES FOR ME INSTEAD OF THE ELPRIMO SITTING WITH 8 POWER CUBES READY TO KILL US ALL
---
Good job man!
---
I would really love this. If you manage to save up to 1000 boxes opening them up one by one would be pointless.
---
I‚Äôm here and as thicc as ever.
---
I think he should throw out his Dino for his super, and his regular attack should poison targets and heal his Dino when he hits him. And then the star power should allow him to heal teammates with his shots.
---
Really wish they had nets or at least category‚Äôs because it‚Äôs annoying to have teamers and have Shelly‚Äôs that freeze you
---
No you didn‚Äôt 
---
Id say colts chin is just a pirate mark but he dosent have that skin yet so..
---
Yo welcome to the club bro 
---
Thats a good idea Supercell should probably make that an option if possible.
---
Thats a really good idea i didnt really think about that in a way thank you
---
Uh I don‚Äôt think you have the right trophy count. 12k is all brawlers 500 or 11.5k
---
Remove some of the walls it spread the out evenly, other than that it‚Äôs a great concept 
---
I never knew this! But sadly you wouldn't know if your phone ran out of battery. And yes, BS needs to fix their servers.
---
Dossnt he have a line for his bird tho 
---
lol i thought life leech was the name of mortis‚Äô star power 
---
Because of their hairstyle?
---
It basically has the same problems as Cavern Churn, but kinda(?) worse. The meta is super bland, it only favors close range brawlers. And, with the recent nerf to Bo's star power, the meta for this map basically only favors Shelly, Bull, and maybe El Primo. As well, it encourages auto-aiming, which, in general, is not a good habit to get into. I feel there probably isn't a better fix then to remove it, as if it got a rework, it wouldn't really be "Snake Prairie" anymore.
---
play with teammates from Same or nearby country . when you go random your ping gets tested and game tries to match you with similar ping players, it doesn't always work though. 
---
It was removed rip
---
Your post has been removed, make sure to use the body of a post to elaborate on the title.
---
Yeah they really need to use his work he has really good ideas that just make a lot of sense. I really like the rockstar poco one for example, because it fits pocos theme and it like a fun twist which is what the skins should be
---
Should have spent it on in-app purchases
---
if you check the Brawl Stars terms of agreement/Privacy Policy/yada yada, you will find nothing about individual players owning and possessing the rights to specific replays.   But it is always nice to ask and credit the person and let them know. 
---
That kimono Leon is amazing. The only skin in all that I would consider buying! 
---
Let's not think of insincere possibilities. Okay?
---
Looks nice but Rico already has enough skins
---
Lmao dude you can joke around but messing with the brawlstars team is not cool
---
(Let's think more positive?)
---
I vote rework. This map doesn‚Äôt utilize its theme to full potential. We should add more bushes in the center. 
---
This guy doesn‚Äôt get enough attention.
---
Username definitely checks out
---
Fully understandable that you want a rework, but I feel like there should be less bushes. The meta- Well, I don't need to repeat myself. Just look at the reply for the first comment, and see the problems I have with this map.
---
Exactly. There has been a huge wave of support for him lately, and Im a fan so i didnt want to miss out.

---
Double trouble is the most balanced and fair map.
---
No. U hacked a 4th ammo slot into the game.
---
You can use Shellys special and then attack, then repeat. If two or more Shellys were to try that, then its possible we have a new big brawler meta.
---
My strategic skills are limited to showdowb. I win on other game modes by pure luck. But yeah, randoms are sometimes retarded.
---
Sh-sh. If Supercell identifies, I'm lost.

Uh I think that‚Äôs the point of the vid

I think Scorched Stone is the most balanced map

You might ruin two people's day. Shame on you.
---
Her tools ain‚Äôt for fools
---
He kept losing. 
---
I think most people here are talking about fighting against big brawler Jessie and not AS big brawler Jessie. Jessie and Nita becomes the most common choice because they want the big Brawler. No one thinks of "what if they're not chosen". So we're left with 50% Jessie, 30% Nita and 20% Other Brawler. If you choose a different Brawler and you get chosen as Big Brawler, chances are, you're getting the short end of the stick, everyone kills you before 2 minutes. If a Jessie was chosen as a big brawler, you are left with Jessie's and Nita's with low health that barely survives one attack.
---
It's a lose-lose situation, that's why a lot of people think it's a waste of ticket.
---
Is not that, I mean... Why Supercell don't Round off the numbers to make it more easy? 
---
Go back to sucking that dick cuck

This isn't how statistics work. It's be more like 1 - (1 - 0.012096) \^ 26

what Android are you using? I get them as a notification and doesn't interrupt me

it also happened to me. also when you're one win away from getting your brawler to next level

he autoaims the turret all skill lmao

I actually wanted to capture the drumroll part

He autoaimed the turret. All skill

Sorry guys, the whole map needs 70+ tiles but the map creator has only 60+ tiles. Sorry. I'll create again and I will make sure the whole world are included :)
---
Well not real like in store but real people have did this if you watch le that's the cereal the he has in the background
---
You can't win with Rico and Piper in Snake Prairie. But they are great in other bounty maps (if you know how to use them). Instead of blaming Supercell for every silly matter, stop playing randoms and play with your friends or clan mates.
---
Peace.

Thank God they listened to us.

Why do people think tanks will be worse? I mean isn't it also hard for a long range brawler to quickfire at short range? Brawlers like Brock Penny Jessie would actually have to aim now if they get jumped by a tank.

Also there's a TIP appearing for Carl brawler on Matchmaking screen. I was shocked that when the brawler isn't even in the game but you're giving us tips of it.

Loved the troll at the end btw with the bull super and everyone coming out of the corner... other team must have been so disappointed in themselves.

Ok

Crows MO is to be annoying, not to slay. That‚Äôs why he‚Äôs not great in showdown. You typically want to be hiding most of the match, just poking out and slowly draining health from the opposing team until either you can super in and kill them, or your teams cleans them up. Generally he can be used to deny areas and flag opponents, since they show up through the bushes when poisoned.

Yeah, just add more power gem boxes to the map
---
Delete yourself.
---
but realistically speaking tanks currently are low skill cap brawlers and literally no aiming is required 
---
yeah, and 75power points and 25power points are both also 1 brawl box if you have all brawlers maxed
---
In Beta version, the brawler system was completely different from what it is now. You could only get brawlers and elixir from boxes, and you needed elixir to upgrade your brawler's health, attack or super. You could also get duplicated brawlers, which transform in another currency (I don't know the name) that allows you to buy more brawlers.

Keep saving until they let Carl out then you have a better chance at getting one of the two

‚ÄúWhat would be the point of power levels then?‚Äù Lol r u saying stomping low levels with ur max level is the sole reason for power levels?
---
I thought the reward was the extra skill u get for your brawler at lvl 9 and the damage/hp etc, do you feel as good for a win stomping a bunch of lvl 2‚Äôs n 3‚Äôs with your max level? Feels like your jus stomping noobs.
---
same levels vs same levels means only skill and teamwork is better for you to win

True but you dont have to be so harsh

Well in that case, the spaghetti monster exists, there‚Äôs aliens on the moon, and there‚Äôs a black hole in the center of the earth. This is fun making stuff up, but it‚Äôs better to prove something exists...

it is not an ear (I know it seems like)

Leon was the last brawler I got, and Leon definitely is too OP for showdown, because it‚Äôs almost a sure kill, and there‚Äôs no second chances. Invisibility is a BS power!

Yes data is till very bad. Especially auto aim. Literally unplayable. Sometimes pass midnight it's quite good but like you said still depends. Do you think it's a brawstar server problem or our internet problem? I don't have nbn at home not sure if that affects a lot

Totally, I considered that, I made it so only a limited number can exist at a time and perhaps the spawn rate would also be slowed. Hardest thing though, is coming up with the right hp amount for them so they don't become overpowered/underpowered.
---
Actually these are too good for brawlstars standards

Thanks!

Of course, just leave the signature!

I love it

Poison brawlers and make them run into other brawlers. The secret is sniping people until you get your special up. He definitely doesn‚Äôt need a buff, it‚Äôs just a different style of playing.
---
Maybe footprints?

Awesome

Why don't the dev's ever create a skin based on the community submissions? Literally everyone wants that atm.

all good man, ill send you a link when it is done

Thank you!

what designer do u use?
---
God, you right! Brilliant idea!!! ‚ú® 
---
Poisoning them prevents them from healing. You don‚Äôt play Crow like a Shelly or Bull, it‚Äôs not a hard and fast kill. Most enemies will tend to run away once poisoned, and when other brawlers see that they can‚Äôt heal, they go in for the kill. Then you can finish them off too because they will also be injured.

Ho

I like the little Ê≠ª for mortis
---
It was "loading" in that screen and I could hear the sounds of my bot playing
---
Looks like a 500 gem skin 
---
Haha in this case it's all right!
---
Although I didn't make it so they'd follow you but just go after the nearest target like Nita's bear, them following you around sounds pretty interesting...
---
Well if they aren't targeting anyone and just following you instead, I think they'd stay real close and hide in the bushes with you, but like Jessie's or Penny's turret - anybody getting close enough would trigger an attack. 
---
yep
---
Yee

Ummm, do you recall how this ended for Spongebob? Or should I say Mr. Krabs üòè

Phlorpe's Bo remodel concept is better

Remember back in the early stages of brawl stars, when Mortis was the most OP sh*t in the game? His attacks would send him flying almost twice as far, and he was unstoppable in Gem Grab... or should I call it Smash and Grab? I remember getting Mortis in my 15th box or so. I was so happy.

I play for the gameplay mechanics, not the artwork. I wish people would be this concerned about fair gameplay and brawler Balance on different game modes...

Star power makes a new button appear above the super, every 20 seconds it becomes available? You tap it and an eagle reveals people hiding on map and keeps them marked for 6 seconds after. That's what I got

It's pronounced blet and is very similar to a swear word, probably because the real word isn't allowed

I‚Äôve come to bargain.
---
Yosss
---
I don‚Äôt solo at that trophy lev anymore, the mode is spoiled by teamers and it‚Äôs obviously an unfair match
---
I loved how you gave special mentions to phlorpe and Gedi-kor.
---
It‚Äôs about the individual brawler trophies, not the total. I‚Äôm at 6500 trophies with only 15 brawlers, I stopped pushing trophies due to the high odds of teaming in solo.
---
They make quality content so yeah uwu
---
Why can I visualize this so clearly?
---
You forgot the 's' on 'skills'
---
I had the same idea haha, I think it would be a great star power

Shelly is far from popular in Siege map, I cannot comprehend how match making like this could happen. So poor...

Amazing !

Awesome!

I'd say you can do those jumps

And yea 13% ain‚Äôt much but, till it comes down to that last hit on bounty or showdown or something n that 13% more damage is enough to trump, and ur not even factoring hp, also I like how u exclude star power.. which is the main and most important benefit to being max level lol.
---
Idk man my club leader opened 150 normal and 30 big boxes for gene and got nothing
---
I know that feel/fell

Gedi is our god

I havent unlocked a brawler between 5k( frank) and 9.5k(bought gene). Chill
---
Make Nita = Leia (with the awesome hair buns and a blaster) and I'd be in.
---
It's already a meme on this Subreddit!üòÇ
---
I would definitely buy!
---
Love it when spike got hit with the shovel *MUAHAHAHAHAHAH*
---
5%*
---
I‚Äôm making this post for u/phlorpe, I think he‚Äôs a better artist the u/GEDI-KOR. I can see phlorpe‚Äôs actually getting into the game. u/GEDI-KORE is a good artist but his designs are to much I think.
---
"Night witch mortis is feedback"
---
Maybe make it so the trophies are the same as the other modes.. it‚Äôs too frustrating once every two days to have to deal with this.. and if I ignore it it‚Äôs minus 3 star tokens per week 
---
I‚Äôm not piggy backing, I‚Äôm getting more post out there.
---
Eae mano
---
Where do you make such stuff!!!
---
It's awesome
---
Playing with those under 15 rank and I already lose enough trophies per match.. I don‚Äôt feel like trying those above 
---
smol spike on the gun
---
Yup its like b4 global they were power lvl 1 and now they r power lvl 10
---
It‚Äôs nice as a mode by itself.. I just to get why to deal with this frustration of losing too many trophies every once in two days 
---
Seems like an abusable system...
---
You just need to practice to get better at it. I was the same as you, hated it on day one. Next week, ive climbed 360 trophies using it.
---
maybe the arrows that hit the enemies can track their location in bush for 5-6 second?

Yes I know it following me. And yeah sad you can comment there

I have a 0.2112 chance and have thrown 155$ at the game still no legendary also im a beta player

Brock or Mortis

Going against the circlejerk here but just because someone has good art does not mean they deserve to be hired
---
he's an artist he is skins creator just check his Reddit's account u/GEDI KOR
---
oof, we can't do much besides promote this
---
Bikini Piper pls üòç

Better than most of Brawl Stars's current skins.
---
Supercell's and u/Gedi_Kor's is different styles of artwork

i agree

when you play siege with randoms

Yea because yo‚Äôre supposed to NOT WALK INTO THE DAMN SHOTGUNNERS. Dont complain about bush camping either

\#HireGedi

Though they consider it. It's some sort of. I'm not asking either to make it a bannable offense they need to make teaming disadvantageous.
---
But he's at twelve haha
---
Posted an update in my profile!
---
"Oh look I killed my teammate because he almost backstabbed me let me brag about teaming yeah that'll get all the upvotes"
---
Good idea, but Disney will sue the hell out of Supercell.
---
Same word.
---
 It‚Äôs not a bannable offense you can ask the support team in the ingame chat they say it‚Äôs a viable tactic that isn‚Äôt bannable 
---
Win by any means 
---
dammit, i think you‚Äôre right. I wonder if this increases my chances of opening new brawlers
---
It‚Äôs a luck based system. It‚Äôs not your photo. You may have took it, but the second you put it on the internet anyone can use it for anything. 
---
 The disadvantage of teaming is getting back stabbed lol I do it all the time to dynamike

probably shouldve made her like princess lelia

Construction frank is one of my favorites, it should be on here
---
I sort by new for one day and I see this nice fan art. See you on the front page (hopefully)!
---
For Darryl:
---
Gem Grab - A (maybe S?) Tier: His high health helps him to withstand attacks and with his Super, he can roll forward quickly to assassinate gem carriers or escape!
---
Showdown - A/B Tier: Depends on the map. Maps with lots of walls like Hot Maze or Stormy Plains can make him vulnerable to throwers. Maps with wide open space can allow Darryl to take out Brawlers with his roll.
---
Heist - S Tier: Due to his high damage, Darryl can deal massive damage to the safe. On Maps like Split Second, Darryl's able to roll over water, meaning it will buy some time before enemies come.
---
Bounty - A Tier: Darryl acts as a great assassin for sharpshooters and snipers with his Super but can be overpowered by other close-range Brawlers.
---
Brawl Ball - A Tier: With his Super, Darryl can score goals pretty easily, if he can act quickly.
---
Siege - B Tier: Darryl doesn't act as a good attacker for IKES since he relies on his high damage. His Super can be used to escape however while carrying bolts. Overall, he isn't the best choice for Siege.
---
i am not assuming Darryl's gender.
---
give me a link to t another post
---
Wow, grats from 9800 trophies! Here, 10 gold
---
Probably one of th most relatable memes I‚Äôve seen on this sub so far lol.

Hopefully this ends up on the front page, I‚Äôm sorting by new

That was a really bad play he should've killed your shadow with his normal attacks and then use his super on you but hey it was a shelly and shelly= auto aim

As for the skill gap I don‚Äôt know, but you‚Äôre right about that. Crow is significantly harder than the rest of the brawlers to play. But 5/50 is wayyyy too low a margin.
---
No, gedi kor's is more supercell style and looks much better
---
Just lucky there wasn‚Äôt a Frank with Super in there. He‚Äôll and a party like that real quick. 
---
Thanks! And I have 514 right now 
---
_We all can be proud of fans who make skins better than supercell_
---
Considering that 6 Shellys were in the game, I thought that Frank was the best player ^
---
Reeeeeepooooost

Omg Portuguese?

I fear no man.....but that thing scares me
---
if we repost enough than itll work my guys

Where's Oni Frank?

Eh, maybe, depends on how good Gene feels after people get used to the buffs. 
---
Its hard to not bush camp in this map
---
or a tara with super..just drag everyone in one place and kill them üòÖ

Don't you think this is too hard? Like, you can only hurt the tower for 10 seconds after you kill a boss, which comes every 5 waves?
---
yes

r/ihadastroke

Is Brock one of the characters?

With 300 coins.

Could we have an indicator on the detection range for Leon, maybe like a circle around Leon to tell the player how close to a brawler you can get without being detected?
---
Love how it's an even split of Shelly skins.

i love the design though, actually i like most your designs

Exactly, *started*.

I am a brassie but I love your skins I think you should work as the official creator of skins because afterwards you do not remeke the skins of the game

Thanks... but no thanks

Ummm, to narrow I‚Äôd say

Alright, so I might have been the first person here to ask Supercell to hire you when you first made Tiger Nita, (can't say for sure though), and I see that this petition has really picked up ever since, even though it is getting a little over the top and silly at this point.
---
But considering the fact that they are active on this sub, I am sure that they might well be keeping a tab on your work. And honestly they should..! Because if they choose to get you involved with the design team at Brawl Stars, it is their benefit more than yours. This being said, I wish you all the best in all your endeavours. The world needs more artists like you.
---
Regarding this skin, I would have to say that this is my favourite one till now. As someone who loves rock music, I always wished Poco had an electric guitar instead of Acoustic. So well done! Don't know if Supercell can come up with a better Electric Guitar Poco than this. One simple betterment I would like to see here is to increase the no. of strings to 6 instead of 4. It would be perfect then.
---
Anyway, thanks for making these. Keep doing the good work and your dream might be fulfilled soon üòÅ
---
basically 
---
Reduce how?
---
Playing Piper may be fun if you can land your shots, but my match playing **with** piper who didn‚Äôt land their shots was not fun
---
Eyy I wanna join the cool kids club. I will make one.
---
legendaries take months to get
---
I don't understand.
---
I know its a joke and I am calm lmao
---
I love this idea
---
The bodies of water and the fences make everyone clump together making it easy for a splash brawler to hit all three and possibly kill all three before even reaching the ball. But other than that I loved the map!
---
High risk, high reward
---
Try aiming better next time :)
---
r/englishplease
---
That‚Äôs stupid. It should be the last person who held the ball on the scoring team.
---

And onee-san Piper?

That would be cool

Yeah, currently the most upvoted post on this sub is that petition to hire gedi-kor as a supercell artist, already got 8.5k upvotes. He did nothing to gain them tho.. Is sad how people fall for those tricks.
---
Awww that is so cute! 
---
You stole this, take my downvote. 
---
Wow one skin. You were able to name one bad skin for 59 gems. 
---
All close range brawler don't work well against The IKE because the  crazy dps, only Bull is an aviable option (along with Darryl, but bull tank a bit more than him ad can do more damage with star)  because he can make the thing miss a lot of shots and hit the turret 4 time (3 without star+ the time given by the frank stun) 
---
Shelly's star don't stun but slow people (like spike's super) but the slow effect don't affect fire rate. Only movement speed. 
---

#"feel the power of music"

Thanks to you !
---
he wasn't nerfed? his cooldown was decreased meaning he regenerates his attack faster. it's a very small bump to him... not enough from what he needed.
---
It‚Äôs just like teaming, the more u say it the more people will get annoyed with it. That‚Äôs how you stop annoying things
---
You don't have a 1% chance of getting EACH star power. You have 1% chance of getting ANY star power. It doesn't matter if you have one level 9 brawler or all of them. Each box will have a 1% chance of getting a star power
---
Same crow with new hair and a color tint.
---
Nice!
---
You are great. Ive tried this one time, to protect an afk mortis from a shelly that ignore the box at the spawn to get an easy kill. I ve succesfully killed her... but mortis didn't appreciate the favor and gave me the same destiny as shelly..
---
No not really

You are a random if you play with randoms.

I noticed (not sure if it's from the last update) that the left control will sometimes just stop and jump up to the top of the screen. Really annoying and can mess up battles. 
---
Nuts
---
These don't have a sound
---
When you have at least one level nine brawler, the star power category is open with a 1% chance. Otherwise, it‚Äôs closed.
---
Jessie should make him just like her turret 
---
Idk she is kinda good
---
Why bc ur teaming 
---
OMG she can feed my pussy
---
and that's his thumbs up
---
If the chances of getting a star power in a box were not 1% but 60%, you would say "since I have 15 brawlers lvl 9 I have 900% chances of getting a star power per box", doesn't make any sense.
---
I wish he could grab me...

I see what you‚Äôre trying to do with the water on this map, but I think penny can survive 1 to 2 shots from the IKE to just go around. Might want to make it so it‚Äôs practically impossible to go around. Unless that was your intent, which in that case, good job!
---
Since they are considering a battle season pass system, i think they can make it so that players can buy a fixed amount of "badges" as a currency with coins if they have purchased the seasonal battle pass. And those "badges" can be used to redeem exclusive skins or boxes. 
---
I also think they can inplement an achievement system that goes hand in hand with trophy road that allows players to unlock skins/icons. For example, getting a brawler to 800 trophies will grant you a skin that is only obtainable that way. This will be needed if they do implement another league/rank system as they want to retain incentive for pushing trophies in "normal games". 
---
Obviously the achievement system can also contain achievements that are ranked/league based such as "getting to challenger" (Challenger refers to league of legends league system which is essentially the highest rank possible)

&gt; "Get rid of siege..."
---
Well, no.
---
I'm looking forward to a "real" competitive mode where you play a couple modes with the same team and opponent in a row, testing the real overall skills and game understanding. Something like the competitive mode for over-watch where you get to pick a team comp and communicate with your team before the game mode starts.
---
Obviously this would be cool if they can implement a ban-pick phase before the mode.
---
The downside to this is competitive mode will be rather time consuming. Assuming 3 game modes per competitive game, and the average game time to be 3 minutes (just an assumption considering gg, bb, bounty, heist and siege), and assuming that ban-pick phase takes a minute, including load time it would take 15 minutes or so for one complete competitive game.
---
Thank you! I really liked him
