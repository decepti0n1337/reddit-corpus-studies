Take my upvote for sure

That's horrible
---
Lolantics said ‚Äúhe‚Äôs‚Äù out here

If they do this then they are going to have to adjust how many trophies you gain therefore making it slower to push.
---
Rosa is my game, Botany is my name. Wait-
---
Thief, there us no denying like are you dumb or what!

I destroyed mine‚Äôs screen today playing solo sd

I'm fine with being called hyphen. lol

Trash, not going to be in game!
---
"This is my first epic"
---
*has 2 epics*
---
Brawlers had backstories back then and the backstory for spike says ‚Äúspike is the last of the cactus people.‚Äù
---
This is so bad! What the heck is this!
---
Brock should be higher and imo primo should be S tier, his voice lines add so much to his character when you play with him. And yeah rosa could have had so much potential but imo the accent doesn't suit her and sounds uninspired.
---
Just... It went from you sending, then me drawing, and then you finding.
---
She has a pony tail
---
You ruined it XD
---
Hey she has a YouTube channel called Melody‚Äôs Art please if we could go and give her our support it would be awesome!
---
That's not the point here
---
Someone should make robot versions of all the human brawlers and vice versa
---
Hmmm, well I can always adjust it next time...
---
For now I just want to make her short for the sake of this joke hehe
---
No please don‚Äôt do it

I don‚Äôt think Tara needs a remodel I think she fine right now.
---
Yeah I've got Pam offer too.. instead of 170 gem to 169 ... are they serious about those offers?! üò°
---
I can live with that!
---
Incredible.
---
Then explain the photo on the top
---
the truth is you can't dodge anything in this game really just move around
---
Frank thicc?
---
I never said they didn't gem but you said they did so I was asking how you knew they gemed. So now please stfu before you make yourself look even more stupid.
---
Imagine snake priarie.....
---
This ironically took a good while to make. It's kinda funny trying to make bad drawings on purpose.  
---

---
Though, I actually would love items to be in Brawl Stars, and if you have any ideas post here!
---
Also post here if you'd want me to do more of these.
---
70% damage reduction for 3 seconds ain't balanced.
---
Yeah we know
---
R/cursedcomments
---
so you‚Äôre telling me that you tried to make me look dumb asking how i know it‚Äôs gemmed, i respond saying it‚Äôs common sense, and now you say that you agree with me
---
huh
---
Level 10 already bullies level 6, forget level 4.
---
I miss this map!
---
It‚Äôs based on the trophies of the individual brawler not all together
---
Destruction 100
---
Ok, after all your comments ill see if I can do a revised four seasons.
---
It‚Äôs like that mostly in grassy maps and sometimes in non-Grassy maps.
---
They need remodels first I‚Äôm counting the ones with a new model
---
Nice channel, keep up the good work! :D
---
It's not common sense the majority of people are free to play I have 2 brawlers with star power below 400 and I have only been playing since android release I haven't spent a single cent on the game so now based on my experience I conclude they did not have to gem to get Jessie's star power. Also I wasn't agreeing with you in that comment how you got that idea is beyond me maybe you just can't read but there is no way to prove that but there is also no way to prove that you can read either.
---
Grassy ? or should you mean Bushy ?
---
‚ÄúNope‚Äù
---
Also if this was a thing we could see more cosmetic options coming to the game
---
I don‚Äôt consider his default skin to be a skin that cost gems
---
Op brawler comes out of bushes
---
Blender is an incredible program, I love the people who keep it free
---
Idk what I mean XD but it looks like grass
---
This is actually cool
---
Thank you! I felt dumb and decided to die but have fun!
---

---
It was okay for me, tbh.
---

a period or two would be nice - would definitely help shorten your thesis of a response

you really don‚Äôt have anything better to do than argue in a reddit comment section?

I wanted to play it with rosa but never got to. Bibi too bc she has knockback for meteors!

Nope not really, but then again you keep replying so neither do you.

It‚Äôs bush, I checked Piper star power and it said every time she‚Äôs in a BUSH her damage increases

Glad everyone is going back to playing minecraft again... wish og minecraft youtubers who play fortnite now would do the same...
---
So let me get this clear... if you want to progress,you need CONSECUTIVE victories despite the fact the opposite team would then have 2 consecutive loses if we talk about groups. Because that,from 1000 players,500 would progress and 500 would go back or simply get stuck since its impossible to every player to have consecutive wins. Is this what you mean? Its intented to have players stucked?
---
Ive seen these players before... i know a guy who ONLY plays with a power 1 shelly only and is rank 19... what is wrong with the other brawlers?

Push your colt more

Rosa is my name and fuck me is my game

Now three more OP brawlers than this
---
Pipis (Morter)
---
Attack: dashes but with the range and damage of Piper
---
Super: 20√ó grenades (every dealing the Piper grenade damage and healing Pipis for the amount of damage they did) which are thrown in Mortis style range
---
Star Power: when Pipis attacks from a bush, she heals for 1400 and does 400 extra damage
---
Jam (Passie) - attack: 10√ó Jessie's regular attacks
---
Spikenny (Pike) -
---
Nope
---
Piper: Boom bitch, get out the way
---
P2w inbound
---
Actually no

this applies to league of legends too, couldnt relate more...

oompf

There's a very high chance all his other brawlers is maxed since he played during beta(beta version was much easier to upgrade your brawlers)
---
Ah, yes
---
Glad that cleared things up for you =P
---
Reported) Robber
---
Piper would fit much better into 1500-1790s as well.
---
Wham bam I found the spam!
---
meh the concept is there, just different brawler
---
congrats! I feel bad to say that I got her at 1.2k trophies, but knowing that I probably now won't get brawlers for another 3k or so trophies.
---
**Darl.**

I'm just gonna down vote all of them. 5 downvotes for the post of one XD
---
Oh, sorry I didn't know that. It's hard to find out if a post has already been made

U think u got it bad every time I farm a box even with brawlers that three tap it three people have to come at me from all three sides like they don't have anything better to do

Wham bam i found the spam!

Maybe even damage dealt/assists?

We need a report button

Rly what do u like in this

This clip cool)
---
I havent even unlocked bibi yet she is my last epic brawler
---
Brawl TV definitely added way more teaming for lower trophies and in my opinion slightly less for higher trophies in some modifiers and maps. On my mini people already team at like 0 trophies it's kinda sad lol.
---
I cant tell if you are genuinely blind or not, have you seen the [Humor] or are you joking. I dont understand.

Mortis is just trying to clean the glass of your diner, Bull

I don‚Äôt play clash royale but that‚Äôs interesting. This is actually a decent way to fix up the matchmaking so that they kinda compensate u if the trophy counts are a bit off for the brawlers. I‚Äôm talking about losing 2, 3, 4,  even 5 times in a row, and where the game would show mercy with my system so that in losing streaks you wouldn‚Äôt lose as many trophies.
---
Mercy is for the weak. They deserved their fate

That's not supercell gives you this PP... The box is just cursed by tara's magic cuz of anger on supercell cuz not giving remodel to her...

Im so desperate, Im saving Gems for The 449 offer (only at 144 lol)

No your version doesn't look any cleaner

Could easily gain back the loss with bibi

Why is the most costly offer the least valuable
---
Exactly he could have past the ball.

Oh good luck mate. I'm saving for legendaries and one mythic too, at 229

Im not sure if I understood this correctly, but you think it's unfair that the Chinese get the Star Shelly skin now because the game wasn't available in their country in 2018? They deserve a chance too, we already got ours.

They say you should have put this as a skin idea

Bull is super annoying tho

What did the last Rosa nerf do? I don't see that much of a difference tbh

 We are in a long range brawler friendly map so I don't know

Haha he has 69 battery

I don't like that comp
---
What about the gun?
---
I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôve been so insensitive
---
Fake art stealing has become the new art stealing tbh. There are so many of these low effort "stealing art as a joke" posts that aren't funny at all... These need to stop
---
Bibi can knock her away, colt can do lots of damage. Always check bushes. Also she has had 2 nerfs and is still kinda scary. That‚Äôs how I avoid her
---
Well yes  but no
---
Stolen dude come on
---
I can just hear that one meme that said "I diagnose you with dead"
---
Well yes but actually no
---
I guess you‚Äôre right
---
Crow or Carl
---
What video was?
---
What is this supposed to mean?
---
Why MSFW?
---
Woah, you‚Äôre getting quite a bit feisty here. Why couldn‚Äôt you just make the background on PS? There is no need to cut it out... unless you stole it.
---
The mustache gave me the idea lol
---
I know, but I can't change it :(
---
What?
---
Most probably that supercell hates you. Btw Electro want to add me? My name is Akito04

What if Leon is just a hentai MC?

Will it be okay if i try to make a similar meme? (on another account)

# Really cool map! You deserve more upvotes!
---
Would be cool, I mean it would fit for Reddit
---
You don‚Äôt understand sarcasm
---
Alexej is actually russian man name... Why he need to shame our country...
---
Isn‚Äôt this essentially the same thing as tracing? You didn‚Äôt create the original art.
---
Anyone part 5?
---
Hope this gets noticed in New
---
I like it, it‚Äôs a cartoony Wild West design
---
LOL
---
So true
---
Wow i really unexpected minecraft here
---
So anyone wants my rocks?
---
Yeah yeah this was nice, but this is the same guy who stole another persons artwork and claimed it as his own (snoaker)
---
And I'll do gene
---
there's a few here I never heard, for example...
---
Crow: I'm the boss of the bosses
---
Piper: Ha! Kiss my grits
---
Poco: I'm turning it up to eleven
---
This is a perfect example of post library society, thinking bibs can beat Bibi just because she‚Äôs a girl? Shane.
---
For me it was Rosa
---
How did you do this?
---
Downvoted for the 69 my guy, duh
---
It has been 84 yrs.
---
I guess they'll either remove it or add it in rotation in the next update.
---
Doubt it
---

I know, I‚Äôm just saying that guy has 7K subs which is very good ( I agree he deserves even more than 30K)
---
I want to kill the guy in the green suit....seriously?!?!?
---
Whenever I scroll past this image my reddit crashes. What have you done
---
Unfortunately we already have a brick‚Äî‚Äî&gt;r/brockkgang
---
FR I just got Gene and I want to rek in gem grab with him but I haven't been because he's the only brawler low enough that losing siege with him isn't a massive tilt fest
---
I fuckin hate siege so much
---
The 2 gem holes is a great idea that could be implemented in a few maps
---
Kid, you don't even know how to read the rules. Delete your post.
---
facial expression is perfect, take my upvote :D
---
This is actually so dope, I wanna see in higher res
---
Kid, this "joke" isn't original and has already been made at least 50 times. Stop.
---
I‚Äôm sorry but you k ow what will cheer you up? Upvoting all my memes üòÇ Jk don‚Äôt if you don‚Äôt like it
---
Me: *little robot*
---
This is how I feel everytime im against enemies
---
What? Another shitty and barely relatable post.
---
Also stl?
---
It's saying bad players get crow more often
---
haven't spent a dime. No issue hitting 500 with each
---
Nice
---
I mean no mythics. I had 2 at that point so I think you‚Äôd have to be unlucky to not have any
---
I‚Äôm sorry but you know what will cheer you up upvoting all my memes üòÇ Jk don‚Äôt if you dont like them
---
Snowflake lmao
---
Its like mortis showing colt hes creature of the night
---
Cavern Churn is best map
---
I saw the top of the falgand fought communism, but still the skin makes up for the disappoinment of no Soviet
---
That‚Äôs not bad, quit complaining
---
Looks like the one from mlp
---
I love it for farming tokens
---
My biggest issue is the dead zone on her hit box when she attacks. I miss way too much
---
Can you give the link to where you can make these maps
---
You forgot the part where primo jumps away from your heal right as you press it
---
Lul nice meme tho
---
So you have Spike. I‚Äôm don‚Äôt see why ur ranting cuz you got 1 legendary
---
totally. When ever I need it I dont have it and when I don't want to use it I have to use it
---
yeah but some people, no matter how long matches may be,  dont want the harsh punishment. not only that, but clearly you do not know what a monster siege is at rank 15+.
---
Nice skin! But those fingers are too damn big üòÇ
---
I had a duplicate game as Leon.  It was also duo showdown which is his best mode
---
How is he horrible at the game?
---
Because the legendary chance is low
---
Idk, just more complainers
---
Thx :)
---
Get in an active clan with a discord server, they will hook you up with a good team and help you towards rank 15. They will probably be welcoming bc your dyna is maxed out :)
---
Kill count, damage done and goal scored needs to be included at the end of each match.

Fortnite time
---
Me: have lost 300 in this past week
---
\*wins a game of seige\*
---
Me: I see this as an absolute win
---
So if you don't have legendary brawlers but you have a lot of trophies you are just very good!
---
LOLOLOLOLOLOL
---
I think this doesn't bother me at all
---
Thanks! BTW do you agree to my points? Hopefully I am not the only one this happens to and i am not saying that like I want you to lose trophiesüò™
---
I haven't even startedüòñ
---
8 episodes left
---
it‚Äôs the same thing, why does shit like this get upvoted
---
Arrivederci
---
Same
---
Lol idk this sub can be weird sometimes xD
---
Woah there that's a THICC buff
---
Maybe he's nimble but has low stamina so really he's reloading his legs.
---
Man I can't count how many times I've been saved by a partner Poco  in duo SD.
---
On the contrary they can be freaking annoying  when they chase you  and your hp is low.
---
What a shit post
---
Dude no that‚Äôs my skin, I will rip your brains out if you don‚Äôt delete this &gt;:(
---
Wait,this is a normal gameplay
---
This is easily my favorite one of these yet
---
Pretty cool
---
Yeah, but many of those maps like Cavern Churn and Island Invasion had a lot of Bush camping and limited the # of brawlers that are viable for the map. You can still play tanks well on Erratic Blocks, Skull Creek, Rockwall Brawl, Feast or Famine, and Flying Fantasies somewhat(because of the launch pads). You can make maps that favor tanks if they are tight spaces as well as cover. Even Feast or Famine is open for the most part, but has just enough connected grass to make tanks viable. You just don‚Äôt want to go overboard with how much grass you use.

My power level "Is Over 9000!!!"

Seems like a terrible idea.

Tara‚Äôs star power saved the Brock... OMG
---
There are currently 8 heist maps but the current 2-week rotation can only fit in 7. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôve never seen it, at least we haven‚Äôt seen it for a long time.
---
Damn, you lost too

You are right, I just was going through my pictures and saw that I had a lot of stars in one match and I thought I would share
