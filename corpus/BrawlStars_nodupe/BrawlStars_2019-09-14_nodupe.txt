Well yes, but it is definitely tough though. Basically if your posts get enough upvotes, they could reach the top and can be noticed by supercell developers on reddit. Generally, supercell likes to listen to the community and usually add the most liked ideas of the community! So yeah, hopefully, over time, your reddit account will grow and more people will see your cool ideas! I‚Äôll actually follow you so I can stay up to date with your content. Thanks!
---
Lunar new year is also celebrated in korea and supercell added a korean themed skin
---
ok maybe u r right but
---
ONE THING IM 100% sure about is ROYAL AGENT COLT is a korean theme. It had a korean creator model for a video for that skins release, and its clothing (hat, etc) is clearly a korean
---
Wasn‚Äôt royal agent colt supposed to be a limited time only skin?

Sounds like something from an RPG

In January I got Frank, first brawler out of a box. I went on a full 3 months without a single brawler when my friends were getting brawlers. Even one of my friends got Leon from a free box... I almost stopped playing cause how boring it was to play with 7 brawlers.

If you dont get it:

A lot of players that have 6000+ trophies dont even have a legend or a mythic brawler, and im at 3000 trophies and i have all the mythics and 1 legend. So this is kinda bound to make some pro players jealous
---
Oh ok
---
OK yeah I posted the vid
---
Plus not every brawler needs to be S tier on every game mode. If you don't like how a character plays in a game mode, there are plenty more that will do the job better.
---
You want to report someone that‚Äôs new to the game.. nice

This looks like an Advanced Wars map.

Hm?

Why are you so mean even tho I lose but I don‚Äôt blame them I just forget about it cause it is easy to gain back with the new trophy system

Yes. iPad pro + Adobe fresco app

Thanks a lot

No no I'm really beta tester
---
I have had the quick tab that took me to where I left off on the trophy road.
---
Now that I am nearly to 14,500 ( end of the road "for now") the tab is pointing past the road as if there will be an upcoming extension on the trophy road itself.
---
I don't recall this being setup like that originally before the recent update.

What do you think about that bud ü§î

I am disappointed because my friend said he got his first legendary at under 500 thropies

He still suck

Lmao get off reddit please
---
Translation?
---
Let me tell you something. It may be a good idea, and I say may be, because it still needs a lot of polishment here and there, and mb some balance fix. However, it is a new concept for brawl stars, and since it's a game where you should shoot, but it's not only about that; running through a maze while trying to stay alive sounds really cool.   
---
It'd be really nice if supercell added a few new concepts to the "Event" category. You got my upvote :)
---
2 accounts for over a year and 2 more that will turn 1 year at global time while only having 1 when my sister has crow on like 300 and my friend got 5 legendaries on his 2 accounts(he played as long as i have)

Yeah I got so mad

I've only played for 7 months or less i have 11k trophiea nd no legendaries

Ur brawler levels are all 10 it‚Äôs just skill

Nibba i have no legendary u are not allowed to complain lmao

and it actually is a good game

Holy shit this took me way too long

You have a 98% chance of not getting anything, this is an average mega box

I have 9k but i only played hwen i could get tokens to kinda maximise tokens per trophy or sometimes when im close to a milestone
---
Theres nothing
---
Is that the point
---
transfer coins to gems XD
---
It still is. They're just bringing him back for the moon festival event.
---
I play a lot because everytime i get to a milestone that has a mega box i have hope for a legendary then i don't get one and then i push to the next one

Nope, im from Europe, actually i had this game at 10 AM. I only wrote it for the meme.

now we know el primo is actually fat as fuck but the belt he has makes him look fit

its still lying and i recommend you stop making comments before youre karma goes negative

A dyna pro and a Carl pro :v

Both crow and leon should be swapped with spike, spike is the worst legendary

2nd star power :if she uses her super on her teammates she and her teammates get shield for 5seconds

How you know..
---
Pls be a new brawler
---
Papa says no
---
I wonder what the remodeled version will be like
---
el rudo is cheaper and it's price is going up from 30 to 80-150 gems but el rey will surely be 150 after the update
---
Lolzeeeee
---
I WAS SOOOOO DUMB
---
This is his voice now
---
Ikr it you went for 20 in robo rumble with Max time and token dublers you would have got: 600 (x2 event)= 1200 x2 (doublers) 2400, and you would have only used token doublers and nothing else.
---

Plz dont add a new brawler i somehow managed to get 0.1248 legendary percent... Now again it will reduce.... I have no legendary and i am at 13k trophies üò≠ plz no new brawler... If a new brawler is coming he should be a legendary
---
But he still plays with them
---
This is a video from my new YouTube channel I made please check me out and leave me some criticism https://youtu.be/lkT_SCs-gQI
---
Those are power points. Star points are the same but have a star in the center instead of a lightning bolt
---
Just that i dont think they can reverse the process and hive u back the star points
---
I didn't bush camp ever since I started playing which was when Carl was realesd I just bush camepd one time to see how is it like trust me it's boring af ;&gt;
---
I have noticed that I got new brawlers including legendaries form blue boxes but not a single brawler except Mortis for mega or big boxes
---
so that's why i get downvoted everytime i say upvote XD
---
Cmon man another stealed skin concept from gedi kor. They done this before like tousand times 
---
But we all love gedi kor, get the fuck over here you piss of shit

Woah, now imagine is lying, no,

Even tell something that happened before is lying if the people get the wrong idea

Stop at 0:05-0:06 to see fat primo

True. Star powers make a huge difference at 600+. 
---
I'm aiming at reaching rank 25 (750 trophies) for every brawlers. The only ones I succeeded with that are the 3 brawlers that have the star powers.
---
Damn I need to get my pubg friends play brawl stars now, They will dominate squad showdown
---
I'mma fap on that ass
---
Ty!
---
Probably yeah! Haha.
---
At least u guys won
---
Thanks!
---
Tho it makes it the same because 8 bit is the strongest brawler in the game yet
---
Its not like they were playing with a friend...
---
Only when you have good teammates who atleast know how to pass the ball to you when they are about to die
---
My name is Levi aswell!
---
Can u use ur super to break the TOP right then just skip the whole top left
---
I think they made some changes to the mask you can see it in the animation but other than that it's the same things
---
Which skin Will i buy now? Shark Leon. Or El Rey Primo???
---
looks like he's from fnaf
---
It's time to stop
---
i hope you arent serious.
---
with logan paul thing, most of memes were about his reaction, which was funny if you put some shit like ricardo.(i know that ricardo wasn't a meme at the time but you get the idea) .not the dead body.
---
and this meme is only to mention porn, and to make people watching that shit feel cool
---
He looks quite good. He would be more better if those pants are black and ninja style
---
But what are they gonna review? If the cheating player is under 400 trophies, there‚Äôs no replay for them to review
---
man you are a legand how did you hack into the headquarters
---
Would be funny if someone says Im shaking here.

El primo loses his legs next remodel, and pam loses her head

Wait where did u get this pics?

Could be
---
agree everyone thinks she is OP when she is only strong
---
It's not the same and idc who says hes op because hes really not, his spd is a major downside, any brawler can escape or chase u.
---
Not to mention when he dies u get 2 sec to run, he cant chase, he cant shoot for another 2 sec, so that's 4 secs to run, he only uses it once, and he loses his cubes.
---
Shelly had no drawbacks to hers and she could use it multiple times. 
---
So dont compare them lol, the only thing they are the same is that it gives health. That's not the only op part about it though.

Its on there twitter and youtube community tab

If they would do this i would tell the to give me back all my star point from colt and bull so i can save up.And in the picture with the mega box you have just 200 star pointa and if you buy it you cant still see it so i think you are lying.Exept of the part with the piper
---
this happened to me yesterday, but I didn't close the app, so I didn't start another game. ALL 6 players joined in late, some didn't even play.
---
Except for every time they DID
---
Will we have toothless primo's icon in this update?
---
But it was a bull
---
how did you open this story
---

Leon is the worst crow 2nd spike is the best

is it gonna be replaced by a more expensive skin like gold ricochet got replaced by loaded rico because if so im gonna buy it

I bought that things 7 days before today

he do look kinda sexy doe üò≥üò≥üò≥
---
The ult effect ,drops goodies when shooting the new look on colt animation different
---
I've found them in game. Before a match starts, the map is zoomed out. So you can see it just for a few seconds.
---
r/shittybrawlstars or not
---
I can‚Äôt stand it just because it‚Äôs the typical nerdy stereotype.
---
Damn that will really add more ‚Äúsplash‚Äù damage to his super landing

Primo remodel
---
Its too hot I can‚Äôt support that

I like the typical nerdy stereotype,i think it works with the Carl design and ocupation.
---
Yup
---
It was not hate, I meant to write a supportive message.
---
Can you give me a link to the original image?

Is this a repost, or reupload?
---
I'm a cara simon fan so I'm a dollar
---
Oh ok thanks for real then :)
---
People should shake to that ass
---
Caption Mexico ?
---
Yes, a game skin is hardcore propaganda. Nothing ever can be a joke üôÑ
---
Oh ok, thanks for real then :)
---
next brawler will be mythic/legendary.
---
Brawl-a-rama
---
Its about being annoying tho. Its annoying to deal with a mortis, especially a skilled mortis. Crow can be killed quite easily, but his poison is annoying, dynamikes shots can be dodged pretty easily, still he is annoying, cuz you cant come close to him. Mortis is annoying cuz he can finish you off when you‚Äôre low with a surprise attack, he can steal your cubes, kills, gems etc. And even if you manage to almost kill him, he can quickly dash away and thats it.
---
I had this 2 days ago and it was stuck so long but I stayed for 1 minute and a half since I had nothing else to do 
---
I entered the match after that and it was funny cause none of the other 5 people were moving (presumably they had the same problem and decided to exit the game)
---
I scored one goal and just let the game continue until time was up 
---
The other 5 never came back in
---
Jk not a kool aid guy lol

We all should, but knowing how sneaky supercell is, they probably won't put El Primo's skins in the shop until the update so that no one could buy them for 30/80 gems but 150.
---
T H I C C O  M O D E
---
good post
---
He atacc
---
He protecc
---
But most importantly
---
*he thicc*
---
My meme its just about how you lose legendary chance with new brawlers that you doesnt want, it does not affirm that a new brawler is coming, if i wanted to lie, i would say literally that "NEW BRAWLER COMING" no memes, no context, just like thise clickbait videos on youtube, putting it into a meme would be a bad way to lie
---
i am shaking.. that ice cream looks cold.
---
How much is Rey currently. I bought him in beta for 80 I think but is he 150 now?
---
That would be AMAAAAAZING!!!!!
---
#HE DINT DRAWED,ITS UNUSED STUFF FROM THE ACTUAL GAME
---
There are. And also i'm sad that this only got 30 upvotes, underrated post. Continue doing concepts like this(of course only if you want). Have a good day!
---
Supers that let you jump would be way too op
---
# DUMMY THICCCCCCCC
---
I honestly do not understand your point. If he is trolling at the end and go towards bull while I accidentally died, there is no point of doing anything. What is your trophy range may I ask?
---
I had it once it was terrifying
---
I got spike a week ago and I'm at 15k
---
lul
---
I think he's trying to tell us something.
---
that's not totally true because of the power cubes but I got the point
---
But u guys still won, how bad can they be?
---
I'm not even a primo main but I bet I have more trophies than your primo
---
Triple nice
---
She should shoot a lollipop w/ the stick still in it.
---
This is a mega box
---
lack of damage and low range sucks.
---
100 boxes here i come
---
Exactly
---
seeurlpcl
---
also they can't defend the goal decently
---
Here ya go
---
RISE
---
Hey man I agree with your points. When things get popularly the developers can very well be motivated to add it.
---
Anything's a dildo if you're brave enough.
---
I can explain this star power in two letters
---
What just happened lmao
---
It might stay at 30, people can wait for the sneak peaks from the youtubers and then buy the skin if the price is increased
---
Darn he gets a lot of action during battle
---
Any brawler with a power cube lead can easily win and pressing a button is not talent lol
---
Try making it Ice crow, and he shoots out Ice Daggers. Water crow is a bit anti-climatic. Anyway, Good Skin!
---
What? üòÇ
---
Is this true or just a joke
---
GUYS
---
IF YOU DON'T HAVE EL RUDO AND EL REY BUY THEM NOW
---
THEY'LL SHOOT UP IN PRICE UPON BEING REMODELED
---
If primo is gonna get a remodel will his skins too because I like el Rey primo skin and I have it
---
The youtubers releases sneak peeks before the update and normally they say if the size of the skin increased
---
did you buyed the skins before they get expensive
---
Better be a good remodel
---
Hmm never saw it
---
You could kill him easily if walk to him and even by receiving the damage, you just had to give him one shot...
---
Yeah that but Rank 1 and no trophies?
---
Oooooooo

nope

I don't buy skins

If you read the in-game message, it actually says that it's a event for the whole week. But "Double Token Weekend" is totally not the right name for the event.
---
thid game is so bad i open 18 case hut i didnt get a character why why i need a new characters like leon or crow i have 10k but not have legendary character my friends have 4k but have 2 legendary character game BAD SO BAD
---
Its mostly just pointing out their og opinion for internet points
---
Hey, I was about to say that!
---
Thug shelly didn't get hit once
---
Yeah, I agree that is was definitely a misplay for the Bull to go get the powercubes and energy drink. He 100% would have won if he rushed me. Greed kills, I suppose.
---
Wanted to congratulate you, but have you no shame? Were you going to brag about upvotes with a post that's not yours? What do you have to gain? You end up just being another lazy loser...
---
So apparently because of my bad WiFi I somehow entered 2 matches and in the middle of it I got a Idle Warning and then got kicked from the one I was in (the one I was the Big Boss), then it putted me in the other one where I was late
---
Sorry lol
---
ok then :)
---
WTF üòÇ
---
Well me neither and look where we are
---
ikr
---
Why pushing them in one season? Just push them whenever u want. Even after season reset, your brawlers don't reset their ranks, in case u didn't know.
---
did you use cory's name tag because you cant get first in duo or to get featured?
---
Oh, you are the cold sorry for the ‚Äúyou‚Äù xd GG
---
I know when it's gonna be added. It's gonna be added at *Please, stand by*
---
with 2500 combinrd trophies
---
Would you give money to a billionaire or a person sleeping in the streets ?
---
Haha no worries!
---
The idea of the starpower is to run away not to take easy kills
---
Just because I was to lazy to try the glitch. Screenshotted it from corys video
---
Congrats to your little bro! Even though he's just 5 year old he's done a great amount of progress in the game it's really commendable. Since you finally shares your bro's progress I'll share my 9year old brother's progress 
---
https://i.imgur.com/RkaeVkD.png ,I feel like being just nine year older he's doing a really good progress in trophies, before trophy buff he struggled at 4k.üòÖüòÖ

"Poco main sad noise"
---
Definitely not me................................OF COURSE I AM EXCITED
---
ah okay
---
8,5/10 ü§©
---
Because this kind of balance is not that important to most brawlers. It simply doesnt get a reaction one way or the other cause it's an arbitrary balancing.
---
Thank you
---
6,5/10
---
Sorry
---
Don‚Äôt look at the ‚Äúfree kills‚Äù part of the star power. This is essentially just a extra life. A chance to play again. Giving you time to run away
---
I did not steal it, I used it, the developers released the files so that people can use them freely, therefore its not ‚Äústealing‚Äù. I think I made my point. Thank you.
---
Looool ikr????
---
I like the game, but we are the customers, they are the suplier, they get money out of us, least to be expected is a game with as few bugs as possible.
---
El primo is most likely be getting a remodel next brawl talk
---
I'm dying
---
Thiccccccccccccccccccccccccc
---
He just got spikkke
---
Finally, someone with common sense
---
Welcome
---
JUST OMG
---
MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA
---
He has 21/28 now he got his first legend spike today
---
Carl with energy drink as the pickaxe returned
---
When he jumps he will do more damage bc of the thikkkkness
---
Check your spelling before uploading
---
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs exaggerated. This version of his star power is to be used as an escape.  This is only during his shield so it‚Äôs not that long, and it should give him distance away from anyone he wants. It is more understandable why I said 150%?
---
I know, that's why i don't want him to be afraid, life is harsh, and it's beautiful in the same chaotic way, being scared of everything will just highlight the bad things in life, i want him to see the better things in the future.
---
Yes its a El primo remodel
---
Day 300
---
I still don't have any legendary
---
They don't get any money from most of us. FYI if any one of us thought it's just business nobody would be here in reddit they would be at customer complaints.
---
Of course to the whomeless but in this scenario we can't give it to some who needs it more. None will force you to use a code. It's just a nice way to help blawr stars youtuhers since they are humans too and that's their job.
---
Insta isnt that bad? Why hate?

Well, 6/10

Yes. As soon as we got 5 gems he gave up and stood still in that corner the whole time

HOW DARE YOU BLUR THE GUITAR PLAYING BOY IN YER OWN COMMENT but Poco has had two remodels there was that first creepy one but hey it was a nice shot then he got another one and then here comes another and he looks good my only complaint about it is that... they never kept that giant guitar
---
God yes
---
your minimum legendary chance is 0.0094 and if the highest ive seen was 0.3
---
What did I walk into
---
I kinda like the bow remodel but I miss the old animation when he loses
---
indeed yes cause it costs 80 gems currently the price will go higher after the update
---
ja pierdole gosciu o co ci chodzi

thanks you too

oof i had 10 chests and opened 6 and than upgraded mortis to LVL 9 and in the last box i got coiled snake F for you

stop being suck a dick man... he just thinks its funny

I!ve seen 0‚Äô4

ikr im tired of seeing these

That was the worst spelling i have ever seen
---
Gat post?
---
tbh i find rumble the only mode that seems actually friendly for all characters
---
What the hells up your ass...
---
If you get a brawler it decreases you legendary chance, so if you got a mythic or an epic it has decreased it
---
r/HeavenlyBrawlStars, Amamzing work. I can see u put a lot of time into this
---
But I think even making 20 lives for 1 person would be smarter than making 20 lives for the whole team, u know, it'll become brawl ball V2
---
No because that bibi has 401 trophies
---
Smh you literally have Chinese characters in your drawing bruh. Nice work but you need to get your facts right. Happy mid autumn anyway.
---
HOW DARE YOU CALL BRAWL STARS A CHILDISH GAME
---
Awesome work! Only thing is first SP seems kinda broken. Op in gem grab siege and sd (especially energy drink) but useless in ball (unless it applies to that? Then broken there too) heist and bounty
---
Mhm
---
He just replied and your getting so pissed smh
---
Late to the party, but you're right. His first post was funny, then he saw all the karma and decided to continue on the saga
---
Shelly with super is  Saitama
---
Men, escreve em ingl√™s, se n geral vai ignorar
---
Level up other brawlers, star powers are not that hard to get from chests
---
This is an model for El Primo,not a remodel
---
Oh ok imma delete the post now but I will upvote you, enjoy you free karma
---
Look at them ToEs. . . YuM
---
Or they don't want to give away the brawlers gender
---
Although, I don't feel bad. His skin showed many flaws, and I'm happy they're fixing him up.
---
Post on r/Brawlrecruit
---
Well just like shark Leon came around enough people bringing it up will bring it to the game
---
Is this legit?
---
What is karma?
---
The forest brother's
---
It would be kinda broken cause it would be harder to see leon that way, but cool idea (maybe it only happens when he goes invisible and goes near an enemy)
---
Cort
---
Oh, another costumer!
---
People are saying alot about dynjump and supers that can break/jump over walls.
---
What if they made it so you cant jump over walls with supers/dyna jump and supers couldn't break the walls?
---
I SeRvE ThE sOvIeT uNiOn
---
Awww just....JUST FLAWLESS
---
I can just imagine El Primo singing the entire song and it's hilarious lol
---
Don't bring up _that_ part of the internet
---
F2P or P2W?? i have star powers for leon, barley and coiled snake for mortis :)
---
No it's tomorrow.
---
I just looove that part,
---
Yeah I know it's just i have  a small phone so yeah
---
#BAPAAAAA
---
I'm sure you do.
---
It‚Äôs recommended to only buy star powers when you have nothing else to spend your gold on. There comes a point where you have all the Power Points and you get nothing but coins from boxes. That‚Äôs when you know that you‚Äôre running out of things to spend gold on.

Gotta give the dev team credit, they do damn good work. For a community primarily made up of whiny children who beg for new updates 0.0005 seconds after one gets released no less

i know about the leaked image but can you show me the link of frank's comment?

Oh nice i don't mean you but alot of people post like my posts

Rosa, would you like to join me.

He didnt. I follow him and everyone who works on Brawl Stars. He just said "it would be cool" and we already know it's coming in the future.
---
But I don't think they can make a Club Wars system in 3 weeks!

Bro chill am at 11.3k with just one legendary and on of my online friend at 7.8k has all the brawler and he is not even a p2w -_- :'(

there is no conversation you dumbass

Frank already said some time ago that Club Wars is nowhere near to be added to Brawl Stars bc it need to make sense for them to add. This is a reply Frank gave to a user who was asking on twitter about the adition of club wars.
---
I'm sorry I dont use twitter, someone posted a screenshot of on reddit. Sorry :c
---
Wait what two new brawlers??? Really??
---
Please forgive me for what i already did

Yep

Although I posted it

Beautiful! I actually pictured Neo having a blue and red ‚Äúhorn‚Äù but besides that, nice job!

yeah finally clubs will have some use

Eh, I can't be bothered whether or not you think the comment section of a Reddit post is a conversation between people or not
---
SWORE!
---
*guys i'm shaking-*
---
That squid wars face is mood
---
That's very true for artists (even tough as for motivation, they are paid for their work, and being the creator of a rare skin might not be as bad as all that).
---
But it would just be nice to have something that differentiates the players who were there since day one (and even beta) just as a little way to flex (we got star Shelly skin but that's it).
---
Maybe they could do a variant? Keep the models but add a slight change such as the colour of the sweater or the colour of the hat, etc... A little something that could differentiate the 2018 Brawliday skins to the 2019 ones as a little way to flex
---
SWORE
---
The top phrase
---
don‚Äôt need flex
---
ok where can i find the screenshot in this sub

Ya I was just thinking of the magnets from cartoons so that what the horns are right?

Keep your post titles descriptive and provide context. For instance, if your post is about an in-game suggestion your title should include a brief description of what your idea is.

Supers would ruin it you can pass through all the walls even if the grey are invincible

!men btw ‚Ä¶ yes more upvotes lol

Should be in BRAWL STARS
---
Crap I forgot I accidentally bought El Rudo. I hope they improve him and maybe make him worth more.
---
I have to disagree. Jessie's turret is pretty ok rightnow. They ballaced it pretty good. Jessie is still the best brawler for that mode but this is just how things are. Some brawler are just better on some modes
---
My mind has been blown

Maybe, but I currently am drawing White Crow Rework, stay tuned :)

Ngl old Bo looked like he was wearing a mask

It's not Supercell, it's the other random on your team being queued with the Bo that put him in your lobby.

I lost lots of my trophies because of this dumb server issue. This is not fair, after playing this long I'm considering dropping this game
---
This would actually be sick ngl
---

A *samurai* Crow wearing a karategi with a hachimaki on his head wielding daish≈ç and kunai?

Pick a theme. Either he‚Äôs samurai, ninja, or karate.
---
rock
---
It looks grate
---
So gooD
---
Guys i got leon before i got brock i was like 800 i didnt know its rare to get a legendary because now i have 18k trophies and all the brawlers i guess im lucky im f2p
---
When colt looks almost the same
---
150 gems skins aren't that common since most players are f2p and rarely save up gems  or simply use them in token doublers.  And yes, rockabilly Mortis WAS rare before the discount. There's no need to get that triggered man.I know where youre coming from but , you enjoyed it when almost nobody had him.
---
That‚Äôs called snappy sniping
---
Well, that's BB for ya. Sure, go for it, bro.
---
Someone joined my clan then left a day later with leon and crow. AT 1.5K TROPHIES!
---
I'm gonna guess the Colt thinks auto-aim is cruise control for cool
---
Usually if the Colt seems to suck... that's probably the case
---
blyat gopnik
---
This is amazing
---
13.5k with crow and spike I have 27/28 all I need issssss Leon
---
r/fuckingstop
---
I have 1050 trophies and I have Spick and crow but not Leon 
---
So sad üò≠ üëåüëåüëå
---
If you remember when blatant karmawhoring on this sub didn‚Äôt exist, you qualify for a veterans discount.
---
Nice mesage :‚Äù(
---
Nice! What did you use to make?
---
So true
---
So why u posting this?
---
so cool
---
Anyone can use any flair. Also theyre called trophies.

Thanks a lot! Should be coming this week, although I am busy with my math classes (cause of the upcoming competition haha) and pushing to 13k, but definitley coming somewhere in the next two weeks :)
---
3/10
---
Thanks so much
---
Hey this is cool
---
Yeah one question here WHY?
---
Black pants would be better than green so he will be leon+crow=dab √ócreon √óleow =meow
---
r/beatmetoit
---
Jajaja
---
u/imortal366, oops.
---
i found the el primo without teeths so i done this
---
Like gun game
---
No way, where did you find that?
---
Is he bomer?
---
If you have crow/el primo with meteor rush, i recomend using one of these, get everyone to your spawn, charge your super and just jump and hide, crow is the same, charge your super, and run, with mortis just run as fast as you could and try to avoid shellies, for leon, both starpowers are use full, but smoke trails are better option here, on table flip leon is really good, got over 3 minutes. Just dont be too agressive, crow is the best option imo, you dont have to get too close to the enemy
---
Not only an amazing concept, but also one of the most mapped out ones I've seen on this sub ever. Very well done.
---
HAHAHA no
---
If you got u/GEDI-KOR in on this for art, I think this would actually have a chance of surviving to Supercell's consideration.
---
That needs to be a skin honestly.
---
Then dont complain. I
---
Sorry I didn't know I was just wanted to play with random people. Btw thanks for letting me know
---
Great idea! I think 9 brawlers is quite a lot. What if you had to make your own team and enter into the mode? With 9 people they might need to remove double/duplicate brawler rules. Nice job!
---
###Still kills bull with energy drink because he‚Äôs wizard barley
---
Perfect...
---
And you‚Äôre still at 6k
---
Cute!
---
I mean we already have a brawler linked with electricity
---
My brain at 3am realizing i have a home work
---
As you should be. Nice work.
---
When I immediately saw EMP, I thought it was inspired by Sombra from Overwatch

Too dark for a game meant for kids

I played with Ricochet but I don't feel nostalgia, even though it was my favorite brawler at the time (and still is)

wanna help me fight the emoji police? join my cause and become a member of r/AntiEmojiPolice!

Let‚Äôs see this get added in with the next update

Both of his star powers are really good (smoke trails is better overall though)
---
#parry this you fucking casual
---
Splash splash your opinion is trash
---
First time I ever see someone dodge curveball, you are really good!
---
No? Star shelly is supposed to be limited to reward players that played since global launch. If they started giving it to everyone it would ruin the point.
---
I do üôÉ
---
Why downvote?
---
What if there were team events for gold or gems. Like playing one of the modes between clubs
---
Yes. FinNaLlY some people who have it too..
