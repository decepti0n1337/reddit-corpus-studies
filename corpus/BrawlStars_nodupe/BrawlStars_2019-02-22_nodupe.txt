My thoughts exactly.
---
---
---
I’ve played crow a bit and I agree that this is the way to play but I don’t think that it should be that way. He should be an assassin because that’s what he’s supposed to be
---
esch player has 1k trophies, not much
---
Looks like the goons in spy kids
---
Yeah that seems fair
---
if no teaming  then camping will be easy to push trophies, I dont wanna say that but my "mmm lv1" acc got 19 brawlers with 500+ trophies playin with random and sd only. u can check on my youtube channel. 
---
I’m guessing you are the annoying one that keeps making petitions.
---
Oh nvm then lol 
---
Your brother is definitely a genius!
---
If it released. I’ll buy it, bro.
---
Repost!!! Booooo👎
---
I really like this, and it makes sense
---
I would love to see this in the game, best 1v1 idea I've seen yet!
---
Star power Healing buff on last balance change really make crow become the weakest brawler.
---
Buzzkill
---
I actually never been in that situation cuz I'm a Piper user for SD ;D 
---
Yes
---
Just because it's cat themed?
---
He didn’t come to me directly, but that was fine by me! He left the credits. And if this is what it takes for Supercell to note that idea is to add in the game, I'll be very happy! I would like to test it on Brawl.
---
Let’s go!! Can’t belive we won that man gg!
---
I think this needs some modifications for it to be a good mode, because at the moment, it’s not the best mode idea. First of all, there isn’t anything like poison clouds, so for example, if you play someone like Shelly, you can camp in a bush until your opponent gets near you. There’s also being able to play brawlers you don’t have, which if you don’t know how to play them, it’s basically a guaranteed loss. I think this idea has potential, you just need to modify it a bit.
---
I'm sure this was meant to be a cold joke, but I'm not catching it.

they look like pigs waiting to get chopped

Yeah how are you Commenting/s
---
They added pooled match making which takes into account total trophies, but nothing really in regards to power. Many people think that this makes match making against randoms harder.

You're teaming yourself...

Didnt think about it, you’re right

I think that’s a good idea

Pls do a Leon/Tara skin concept 
---
Hero tokens
---
Was already made
---
Congrats bro!
---
You're in the game but others see you offline! So no one can observe you or invite you
---
**Put in an image for the map**
---
Leon’s called silent assassin for a reason
---
Yeah Cacnea
---
What language is that 
---
Pixel Crux's map designer is out of date. Don't use it.
---
*temple ruins flashbacks*
---
Dont get it..
---
333.3 coins equal 1 gem
---
Maybe higher it to 500?
---
So this could reward only beta players?
---
This could give a balance to 1,5k accounts getting legendaries 
---
Supercell doesn’t reward the beta players 
---
I sure am! You are pumping out lots of art recently, and it blows my mind because they're still really good!
---
No, this is why we need an immunity nerf/removal in duo sd
---
That screenshot is at least a year old
---
I was just trying to get Shelly to spawn on them which is why I ran into the bush
---
Source: am the bull
---
Star power of genne is interesting but no strong in other mode's of game apart of gem grab.
---
Thats happened in so many of my games it just leaves me shocked lol
---
Awesome work! That’s impressive!
---
No
---
El Pulgaaaar
---
i got crow the other day, was super excited till i used him
---
That's all the more reason to get it fixed. Complaining is the only way a consumer can influence a company to change something, and this is something that can and should be tweaked around until it's fixed.
---
That too 100%. But I feel like Shelly has a good range jump on Bull and her super also just devastates. Maybe it’s balanced but I feel like it can shred through too easily. Maybe just make it longer to get the Super?
---
Can confirm
---
It’s funny
---
How both of them catapulted themselves to their death 😂
---
Honestly, how hard is it? Its basically boss mode without mini bots spawning and with much lower health and only singleplayer. Do something about this before I upvote it pls.
---
RIP
---
Do you feel bad when you write bad comments? I worry and worry while investing time for this work. Remodeling a game character is very enjoyable. Do not defile my pleasure with your joy.

REPOST
---
People who claim Crow is underpowered have never hidden in a bush as him, saved up three spurts of ammo, and ambushed a non-shotty brawlers with three well placed attacks, it's over 4000 damage if timed perfectly, and 2000-3000 on average, not counting poison.
---
Besides, Crow's star power makes his poison nerf the enemy's damage, making this combo even stronger and giving another reason to poison the enemy that isn't damage.
---
Btw, Gene's star power has such shit range that an enemy Penny being alive on the field is an immediate threat to anyone trying to use it. (At least from experience)
---
I'm black. it isnt funny.
---
Good luck man, you’ll love the survivability
---
SD
---
The highest was in the 50s or 60s I think
---
Bull wouldn't be good here because there are no walls to hide behind 
---
I guess snake prairie is his worst nightmare then. I see people run all 3 of those brawlers in a comp all the time on that map.
---
Holy cow
---
You forgot pam star power
---
I would love this :D
---
^Ow^°
---
He is referring to Chastity devices
---
1 block gaps are a big no-no in Brawl Stars. I'd suggest remove the one block gaps.
---
Imagine being so bad that you have to team vs 2 cubes Shelly. Even with super
---
Tip: if you stop playing the game for at least 5 days then come back and open a box, it’s much more likely that you will get a new brawler. I’ve done this twice and got piper and Leon on my first try and Frank on my second.
---
Looks better than the in-game one, good job.
---
His star power is already stronger than lotta star powers
---
He was trying to get his gems.
---
This will also include, the Heal by Nita Star Power and Jessy to the turret
---
Poco's sp doesn't heals himself lmao
---
No furries allowed
---
Can I use the bottom one it’s insane!
---
Thanks to everyone for the love, This subreddit is so positive I love it!
---
Holy, niceeeee
---
I mean he's nice...but the charge part...not so much (no offense i like this character) it needs a little rework cuz how you gonna auto aim?
---
may I ask what is duo zhowdown
---
But I don’t SECRETLY team so the dog is wrong😛
---
Give me Crow or Mortis **IMMEDIATELY** 😤😤😤😤
---
I like the star power:
---
Now leon got some competition 
---
are you making fun of supercell for adding a skin someone made a long time ago wanting it to be in the game?
---
Good 4 u
---
this would be a very good skin!
---
haha dumb colt
---
*You're
---
This takes away crows ability to control tanks in bushes but nice concept
---
R/Forhonor
---
That’s not mocking that’s just playing stupidly 
---
Hey wanna trade?
---
I will give you my power 3 frank for your tara
---
Also to clarify, the charge would have to be manually aimed, just to discourage auto aim, and make him a higher skill cap for the pros
---
Ye still “solo”
---
Smooth!

Welcome to brawl stars

Dont

Best insult ever
---
i dont understand like if they're going into the poison just let them be there
---
I honestly don't know where the storage for those go. In our own phones or somewhere on Supercell servers? That may have something to do with it
---
Well said.
---
Villain Club!!!!
---
Wait...he's gone :(
---
I hate when he turns invisible
---
... and as you play more, you'll realize that bush camping is not that worthy nor works the way meant just now, not just with crow, but with anyone.
---
 Crow SP reduce enemies attack by 10%, with your 3.5k hp (being generous) that's nothing. SP are this added perks that fits characters design or improve what they have to offer, on crow's case it goes unnoticed.
---
Gene's sp do counters Crow, he counters crow in every aspect, range, area, damage, health... 
---
Btw penny would have some issues getting near gene in first place, it could work as a wide open ambush if gene has his super or if your mate has it.
---
El paino
---
I fear no man....
---
But this gave me a heart attack 
---
hes probably new but the "i camp in bush with bull" thing is awkwardly specific
---
bull is quaking
---
&amp;#x200B;

Well congrats partner :D

Just cute :.p
---
Then what is the point of the post?

Kkkkkkk yes! 
---
DOES IT NOT LOOK LIKE AN ICE SPIRIT 
---
Exactly 
---
How do you make these so quickly? I expected this to come tomorrow, but I guess you make a lot haha. Really good as always!
---
Gene is literally another nerf to crow too, with his star power

I just wanna play my favorite brawler without having to worry about how I could have chosen several better brawlers every time

I sorry for privios post so i draw these concept hope you liked thank you
---
How many trophies you at?
---
Unfortunate u don’t win, but what a play!
---
I was just thinking about that. But they have a bunch of work right now, they just released the game.
---
And of course they are making games for mobiles, not consoles. But it woild be cool. 👍
---
Only 80s kids like me remember buying him for 20 tokens
---
People in the internet gets very sensitive with the N word, but for some reason they're the people who use "fag" anytime they want.

Makes me wonder why someone can't receive discrimination but others can.
---
I didn't see it the first time. Nice catch!
---
Tea of course i get it from brawl box
---
Not that impressive, anyone can auto aim
---
I didn't know .... :(
---
solid effort!
---
That’s called playing with friends or clubs. Randoms are designed for quickie games... u jump in and out without fuss in between whatever you’re doing during the day
---
1200

I also have lvl 10 nita and lvl 8 primo
---
Oof
---
I've been playing since beta started
---
Nah it just feels like it lasts a few centuries 
---
Awesome
---
Plz tell me how I can post things

No it's not. You have to summon Satan and sell him your soul for gene. Hope this helped

Sooooooooo original

Feels bad     (i lost 80 in 2 days btw) 
---
Especially in feast or famine
---
chance 
---
How about buff
---
nita knows leon already lick it
---
I agree 
---
Don’t jack Apex legends so shortly after it dropped 
---
Indeed, never forget our fallen brother. 
---
I know but the spelling
---
I have witnessed too many times an el primo jump into the enemy team.....
---
Another time in brawl ball it was 0-1 and we were losing, I had a clear shot but my teammate goes right next to me,so instead it passes it to him, and they died, and we lost.
---
Once there was this unusually aggressive rico on my team in duo showdown, they had low health and I was dead, goes straight into an enemy team and they try to fight off a shelly and a brock, which they died
---
It's okay, that's why I'm telling you
---
You will play in supercell servers so you don't have to pay NSO and if you want a console you pay 300$ to play other games, not only brawl stars and a lot of people will join the brawl stars community, in my opinion I think there is nothing annoying.
---
Removed - Your post is too short, please expand on your title.

Look realy nice!

I think if this post reach the top supercell maybe see this and can think about it

how it fells to play to much league of legends

I had a dream I pushed my crow to rank 20

Like my post to vote tara and dislike for colt

r/oddlysatisfying

Teamers begone!

I want one without the towels

It's only a suggestion what I'm hoped what supercell see, but I think this isn't going to happen. But some mobile games like arena of valor or pc like fortnite or smite are available on switch.
---
Oh man a 1000 hp bull:)

I hate bounty..... it’s all about using toilet paper for your counters 😎
---
Do you mind if I make these actual cards XD I know how to, plus I'll make it like a pokemon card, it'll have the logo on the back, and I'll be sure to credit you
---
Is that the old poco model I see?
---
Good map! I like how the middle is open 
---
Needs bushes
---
amazing English 10/10
---
Brawl stars on switch should be free but it need a new switch skin, of course.
---
Quick little tip: proving that you have something (in this case friends) generally speaking sounds desperate, try toning it down and you are more likely to win internet arguments 👍👍
---
Until you’ve experienced 400+ trophy tilts that last months, you haven’t tilted 
---
That ain’t it chief

It's only and idea, but I'm happy you like my idea

Op. Do you know me ODE?

Commenting in this thread why tara wins

Snake Praire: Am i joke to you?

Commenting in this thread if colt wins

Plz tell me ur in r/crowgang

Okay that's new!

Nope, I have 12K trophies, name is DG in Belgium, you can search IT up.

Should I be scared I’m a F2P player and I’m 350 trophies away from that?

Shit post stolen ur so lazy and dumb dude
---
ok but didn’t show super?
---
Ok
---
lmfao no popcorn when he shoots 
---
I have the same question.
---
what about for completing the event you get a choice
---
big box ( 4 big boxes?) 
---
power points ( 50 on 8 individual brawlers) 
---
gold ( 400 gold) 
---
It’s as cute as the Sakura skin I love it!
---
Yah sorry, I found out about the super after I stopped recording
---
Maybe make the bushes tall grass? But spot on without a doubt!👍
---
Petition to make this have 69 upvotes and leave it that way
---
I guess it’ll be 150 gems after. 
---
Bulls 0
---
Throwers 6 
---
Just pray to rngesus .just pray man....
---
Cuz I got nothin
---
You got dem moves
---
Probably gonna get nothing, I got crow not that long ago
---
Buy gems 
---
Press x to doubt
---
If its on special price, there should be 150 gems written beside the discounted price. I think 109 is his original price tho. 
---
And..... you can do the same.... it’s a tactic, which they will not remove.
---
nonthrower hell
---
Turn into popcorn without star power？

Ofc you depend on you team. Gene is a Support brawler

Is there anyway we can get the old  rico as a skin or something he looked so much cooler before...

Would definitely buy

You're welcome!

No Leon Cat...

But Lat :)

No.
---
where is this survey? link?

something something merely a trick of the light
---
And you’re right 
---
And now? What’s next? :)
---
Who did it?
---
It's pretty cool, but there are some 1 tile gaps that need to be taken care of. 
---
This would give maxed players a reason to play. 
---
I made this myself. Sorry if we had the same idea
---
I wouldnt mind getting a mythic brawler! I like all of them especilly the creature of the night
---
Yeah😂
---
In what way would he need a nerf? His damage is decent on every level
---
If the font on "cat" was closer I would have fallen for this. 
---
He wasn't cocky you fuck
---
Same but brawl ball
---
He's an actual Assassin now,Is this an Assassin's Creed reference by chance?

Well I have created this, maybe someone else too but that could be my friend as well
---
400 coins-20 gems
---
If this happens I might have to finally put my foot down, they killed clash with their greed and they're already eyeing brawl jeez
---
I don't think that getting a new brawler is an autoloss, clash royale for example easily allows people to get to cards they don't have in draft and if the player is skilled, they do pretty good. This would even increase the skill cap as you would step in the boots of different brawlers and understand how they play.
---
The bigger problem imo is hard counters, like you get Dynamike and they get Mortis. But that's fine too, counters are something normal
---
LOL sure sure. Go earn your "easy" 200 trophies, and come back when you're actually ranked and got a decent screenshot, scrub. 
---
lol
---
Come up with skins for brawlers that don't have any.
---
IQ 1000000000
---
where you draw this?
---
This is why people need to suck up their pride and just autoaim with shotgunners when they're at point blank range smh
---
Actually with his star power when the seeds he shoots hit a wall and ricochet they pop into popcorn. Someone posted a picture of it couple of days ago.
---
Yeah it's frustrating but I hope SC will release some low rarity brawlers so everyone can enjoy playing more of them.
---
Nope. Character with Crow in his name in his Plague doctor costume. Are you sure you know how to use the word "delusional" ? 😂
---
This is the type of fan art you see with 2k upvotes lmao. Good job man!!!

I hope u guy like tings i make i will make more

That's really cool i would buy it instant!

since when did nita grow up so  fast?!

WOW! Nice
---
Is this art stolen or repost
---
you couldve called it "Tunnel Vision"

Lol we came up with it together.

great concept i love it. It would be cool if he threw syringes instead of quills.

Proof what

Oh,ok
---
Could,but did not😊

I’m not your uncle!

Pp up

Only 28 more shots.

yes.

Then u do it.

Its where i live 😂

Sooo where did you steal this from?

That's not very long, I wouldn't expect to get a legendary for a while

Upvote me cuz  karma is bi*ch

Brawl ball is a good place to start.

Shoot I need a rico skin but its so expensive 
---
oof really? Wow lol

I don't think that was the point, he was saying nobody tried to go near him because of the yellow circle.

Nice, but perhaps a bit too luck dependant with the spawns.
---
Throwing out dat super like "If I'm gonna die I'm taking you with me." 
---
Nooooo im missing 23 gems is there any way i can get some gems for free pls i dont want to spend money on the game
---
Good thing I ain’t lactose intolerant ;) Love the work! 
---
SuperCell could you please not change skin prices before release? I remember that in the leaks it was shown that Popcorn Rico was going to be 80 gems, yet on release he’s 109. I’m not saying he’s not worth that much, but it’s a bit annoying to be expecting one thing and then have this small unpleasant surprise
---
I had 110, now i only have one lmao
---
Yeah that's what I thought, too bad you can't control where you spawn.
---
Good idea.
---
Okay 👌 
---
You are right lad.
---
How is mobile more enjoyable than a console??
---
Carefully, he's a hero. 
---
All nope but one yes. I did not start playing yesterday and get to a point where you do not go any further because you did not have luck with the pulls it's annoying. why play if you do not have progress?
---
Looks like he's holding a dildo in his hand
---
It’s indeed a super.

Incredible...

Mortis gang is triggered

It forces you to collect the previous ones before you can collect the others so I can't really get a mode or a brawler before I collect the previous rewards
---
Wait, This wasn't created by them? huh
---
Tip 1: don't
---
guess imma just end my life then 
---
You better BULLIEVE it!

He has too many reskins :c

It definitely is not man. Appears so but someone is typing the number in

How can u edit this on mobile man give some tips

Idk i just do it 😂

I bought it for 30 or 39 just before the remodel

Yummy boxes
---
Hard work should be payed off
---
Damn why are so many skins buyable for 150 gems? We are not that rich to spend money on this game
---
You know the skins are for looks. There’s literally nothing stopping you from playing the game for free 24/7 and climbing the leaderboards.
---
Ya idk why he didn’t, maybe he was scared because he had low health?
---
Black Plague Crow because of anti-vaxxers 
---
Love the names

Just hunt them Down I guess I have killed multiple Genes stealing from me 
---
Why are people posting text without the map?
---
Yeah all the "leaked" posts on here about how much the deals would cost and how much the new skins would be were all wrong. Someone even posted the Lunar New Year deal would be $5 and it got a lot of upvotes. Ended up being $10.
---
i don't get it

That primo was grade A moron, he didn't need to chase you. If you were going into the storm he could have just had the robot kill you and let you kill yourself. you wouldn't have had the opportunity to do that if the primo wasn't an idiot
---
Nah
---
xd
---
You played against my second account (Super Troll) and my two daughters, 7 (Maelys) and 11 years old (Gertrude). They just start the game.  They are just starting the game.

Great job 😄👍
---
What?how do u not know it,it is the big robot that keep following u.
---
?
---
I dont even have crow and yet he needs a buff
---
This is what Supercell meant when they said teaming isn’t a big problem
---
17k viewers isn't much tho
---
Imagine not being annoying af
---
U masteted UI dude,that Jiren almost got ya
---
wow
---
ouch
---
respect my idea, you big shit, I did not ask if I'm in Clash Royale or not firmness? So shut up
---
Nope
---
very good idea, I'm from Brazil and also play the game and when I saw your idea in a channel of you tube Brawl stars (a super famous channel and known brawl stars) here from Brazil I immediately found this idea fantastic, the superceel should rather in my opinion take this idea seriously and in the future (do not delay too long) put in the game.
---
I don't have gene, so i can't really give you any tips.
---
But i reccomend that you watch the video that kairos time made about gene, he gives tips and his rankings on each gamemode.
---
Yeah, paying doesn't ensure any brawler unless you buy them with gems from the shop, so it's just about luck and chances.

Yes...but "modifier" ?
---
r/titlegore at it's finest
---
this amount would be very difficult to achieve
---
Agree for sure. It also gets in the way sometimes. Like when you really need a close attack but don't want the jump, good luck getting it perfect every time.
---
Ok just wondering.
---
We already do! Think about it.
---
Your post has been removed, make sure to use the body of a post to elaborate on the title.

yes

#THAT LOOKS PERFECT!!!!
---
Maybe some chinese event. 
---
OmG you made my imagination come true.
---
Yes I know that feel, I gave up on collecting those a looong time ago, now I’m not dropping 50 trophies or more to get a goddamn token anymore. Hope you’ll find someone to play with 👍
---
U watch porn exposed
---
I think you are right. I left brawl stars for 1-2 months and then got back on December 2017 update and opened my first box and got mortis 
---
Super boring
---
Haha thanks!
---
lmao alright man thanks yeah its not really worth the drop for like 47 coins lol
---
Love the new brawler idea, this is the best one I've ever seen!🤩
---
Brawl Stars dEaFaUlT dAnCe
---
Yes yes yes
---
we should get different dance emotes for certain brawlers
---
Im at 8.2 and miss 5 brawlers
---
Hi guys, 
---
The character I came up with is called Derri. His special move is that he shoots fire to at all directions and his regular move is that he can shoot fire to one direction. 
---
Best, 
---
Gomez 
---
Hahaha exactly 🤣 
---
A good Mortis player is a nightmare for a mike, I lost count on how much I died to a Mortis 🤣
---
How trash can you be that you have to team as Pam??Well deserved
---
Yep. That’s what I’m just realizing. Maybe they could tell people that before they bought the skin? I basically only bought it to shoot popcorn
---
Typical El Primo player
---
Dude Jessie is like, 4
---
so satisfying! 
---
If I see support, Ill build it on pixelcrux
---
What editing software do you use
---
Great job! You draw very well!
---
Have fun unlocking Dynamike and Bo.
---
No you will still have 90 gems left 
---
🤣
---
I want hug him
---
you dont have to buy anything. 
---
Also so I can jump in the middle with 10 gems in gem grab so my teammates feel **cheated**
---
Pretty much
---
Skill is everything 👌(/s Not including p2w,coz that shit is da bomb 😂)
---
This is a joke or something? 
---
yikes
---
Thanks!
---
Yeah its fun for bulls and shellys and for any other brawlers its the worst map ever

Ha
---
This comment brought to you by pam gang.
---
oof i think if i rember correctly she can stack her supers so she can just rapid fire it. completly broken imo. but yeah at this point i just try to lure el primos and franks to deal with shellys then sweep in like a vulture.
---
Spawners do earn their super when their turret or bear attacks someone
---
I thought he was like that because of duck hunt duo
---
Wow
---

---
He steals the Gems alright!
---
Damn i feel with you, i have the same problem! I could post a lot more screenshots, every time i ask how the pools work i get "closed converdation" as an answer.

See!! I don’t play with this guys anymore but the game insists

I don't think it was necessary but ok

In general, big boxes are garbage. I've received better gold rewards from a singlet box which is depressing.

Well the level of games offered isn't close. App Stores are mostly just full of P2W garbage. Even a 3DS is an in infinitely better option.

Damn rip
---
That aa at the start lol
---
It's only fun for bulls and shellies, or the strongest Shelly since every other one dies in the natural selection process, theoretically Rico and Bo are good on this map but Bo was nerfed and ricochet can't bounce shots in the middle because he can't get anywhere near the entrances or he will get 2 tapped or die even at longer shotgun range. You could say he is good at controlling the outside of the map but the middle is really big and at higher levels everyone who's not a bull is also hiding in the edges of the middle 
---
Wow just checked out your history. Future supercell character designer

Yeah honestly shellys super needs a huge nerf.
---
Hey guys, I just tought about some new variety of blocks.
---
After watching the map contest hosted by Kairos, Lex and Ark, I just tought that we needed more variety. This blocks could also bring new ideas for new gamemodes.
---
So here they are:
---
* **Destructable blocks**
---
   * They may have a life, just as the TNT block/Heist safe, that may vary according to the Map creator's idea to the map.
---
      * This could bring lots of different varieties to gamemodes, enabling a map that is good for throwers in the beggining, after some time change (in the middle of the match)
---
* One-way only blocks
---
   * So this idea came while imagining new structures for brawl ball. This block would also solve some of the 1 tile travessing problem. 
---
   * This block's idea is that only one team may cross it, and from the other side it is untrespassable (even by the ball). The block is just as destructable as any other, but it would allow for 1 tile gaps so that the goals can be different.
---
   * In showdown, the block's 
---
mAdE wItH kInEmAsTeR
---
I don't understand, where's the part where he then jumps to the other team's spawn, gets double teamed, and then loses all the gems like every El Primo I've played with?
---
Bearrrrrr great!
---
would be super nice! dm me for more info
---
you dont hit the super butto right. maybe its to small on your ipad ?
---
It actually looks great 
---
Oh ok , I actually donˋt know anything about that so thanks 
---
Cuz timing succ azz and makes other people lose trophies unfairly.
---
Did you make this? Because it looks the exact same as https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/7yni87/art_bo_skin_idea_medieval_bo/?utm_source=reddit-android, but with your watermark on it.
---
How about Magician Tara?
---
it’d help if we knew what she looked like... she’s completely covered. 
---
But a top hat, and a female suit dressed like a magician could be cool... not the coolest... but cool
---
Nice 👍
---
👏👏👏👏nice 8/10
---
This is a nice idea for starters and even for players who have pushed so far they have nothing to do. Pretty good way of keeping someone interested in the game
---
Now that is a 200iq play
---
Better buy some licensing from Kellogg's then.  
---
Ok then, look at Clash Royale. To get every single card in the game, you have to either spend a couple of years playing the game non-stop or, buy a couple of chests to speed up your progress.
---
Now look at Fortnite, you get the whole Battle Royale thingy for free, cosmetics don't alter gameplay and therefore you spend money on the game if you want to look cool, or support the developers.
---
You don't need to make the game un-fun for those who are free to play to be a success, and I'm sure the Fortnite developers are not starving right now, because they didn't sell weapons, rarities or loot boxes.
---
I spent quite a bit of money on Brawl stars already, and I don't think it's a bad idea to have a battle pass of COSMETIC items. What I don't want is exclusive brawlers, game changing items and whatnot.
---
  
---
I like this idea. Gives the game a little more skill gap and tactical requirements.
---
Basically barley duo are teamers...
---
the rope on his pants are pretty much inside and connected weirdly to his shirt
---
Thank you!
---
No one gives feedback. So yours is very appreciated.
---
The tiger has down syndrome
---
GEMMING
---
Precisely
---
Actually he got X on his beak in one update but its still nothing
---
Go commit No breath.
---
Oh no 
---
Yes. It's mildly infuriating
---
No it's like saying Brock's range needs a nerf, her super is what makes her barely viable in the game. Even with her super she gets out classed by every but 4 brawlers in game. While her super does insand dmg up close, it's ur fault for being that close to her in the first place, and if ur a tank, well u do have team mates and u should avoid getting close to Shellys. And for the 4 brawlers she does counter, even they are much more versatile against other brawlers in game for example El primo whole he rekts by a Shelly does amazing against many brawlers if ur good w him.
---
this map it's my favourite
---
Yes it's very annoying
---
AHHH NO CROW BUFF
---
For the game changing ones like spike Leon bo and dynamike 
---
look at the VERY PREVIOUS post
---
Could it be Retropolis? 
---
Amazing! 
---
What I dont see is how you have gene at 1.1k and I'm on my 4th acc trying to get new brawlers
---
I dont like it to be honest
---
Play morw
---
I don’t know anyone that is tbh
---
I think you meant super, you had me confused there. Star power is where damage increases after bouncing off a wall.
---
Either way it's an epic play, well done
---
no im not feeling it
---
It's one of my favourite characters on Clash royale, i'll love this skin
---
No, I'm f2p so would be unfair
---
Anyone think the developers will see this?
---
Agreeeddd
---
There is a problem with attitude.
---
Got gene on my third account out of four, just got Pam on my account at 6k
---
Alrighty!! Hope to see some great art posted by you soon 
---
But it is coming after you fast  o0o
---
I dont know how. I heard some got leon from brawl box 500 trophies. I got gene from big box.
---
Yeah I had to play quite a bit today lol, right now he's my best brawler I guess, but I couldn't really push him past 300 until cavern churn haha.

Yo that’s so annoying!!!

Lol you won cus of the name
---
My friends have been getting legendarys, epics, mythics, super rares but i cant even get one brawler in 20 day..... 20 FUCKING DAYS! 
---
Seeing spike with deku’s eyes is making me feel uncomfortable af 
---
What can I do?
---
Not so Superior if you teamed but You made it so I'll give you that
---
I mean you could call him out and link the original post.
---
As a Shelly, this is how I feel about medium and long ranged characters. She may be great at close ranged but she struggles a lot vs longer range - I think she is balanced. Also Shelly's super is the only thing that makes her viable. A nerf to it  could really hurt her. And she also needs slightly longer range than the other tanks to compensate for her lower hp. 
---
#Wait what.
---
Don’t say u wouldn’t team look at the game 
---
Leon is at his best if he is close
---
But always put a watermark next time just for insurance 
---
Calm your tits please 
---
So true

A beach Tara, wearing a bathing suit and throwing littles life floatation devices at people

Now that I think of it Yea I would do the same if I was caught in the same situation my bad
---
Holy god this is my most popular post XD
---
That would be good since trophy road rewards are so shit
---
It says "Leon River" I guess thats the punchline 
---
Thx
---
Each Brawler should say how long it takes them to break a chest and then the name of the dev that signed off on that number as ok. 
---
quick question how do you make new accounts?
---
True

The trophies one was the funniest
---

Actually, it's:

---
No Power-Ups
---
Middle of Thousand Lakes
---
Leon Only
---
I hope you're only joking
---
THIS IS EPIC 
---
Since it’s a freemium game, they would then need a way for people to earn these skins without buying.  I’m sure they have some data to show that less people would get the skins then cause they could earn them naturally
---
The company is way too greedy to add something like this.
---
And Shelly, Daryl, bull
---
Wouldn't those work like the regular game, just stop aiming with the joysticks
---
r/engrish
---
So didja make it?
---
How do u make these??
---
I love it 
---
Also I think there should be affordable skins, like panda Nita and golden barley (30 gems each). Then there's the visual-only skins for casual players and more expensive minor-ability boosting expensive ones
---
Why can't he shoot popcorn?
---
Who's idea did he copy? I never saw an idea like this, except this one idea where it was duels, but it was completely different from this one.
---
Awesome!
---
it's not like they're forcing you to do the quests
---
These abilities are also for skins that you buy with gems
---
No habla poor English 
---
Wow! 
---
This is a good idea
---
You should get 5% of the gems this skin makes
---
Disgusting, they will be banned from leongang immediately
---
Your comment history says otherwise.
---
Supercell please add this!

seria de grande ajuda!
