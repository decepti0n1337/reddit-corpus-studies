Darryl obviously
---
---
---
Sorry man hopefully there‚Äôs enough karma for both of us?
---
Why is darryl op now
---
I basically did the same. Still missing portrait to this day... );
---
What,you already have him
---
Does he? Sorry I‚Äôve got Mortis and he literally dies to everything I‚Äôm finding it impossible to use him
---
Raw damage has nothing to do with super charge, everyone has a different hit count and everyone has a set "super charge" stat proportional to its hit count and to how "good" its the brawler's super. 
---

---
Otherwise brawlers like poco would take forever to charge their super while others like bull would only need one shot lol.
---
who hurt you 
---
It is? How
---
Attack buff and buff to his star power
---
All crow needs is a health buff and getting his super faster.
---
Get it bro! I just got my first champ to 500 today. 
---
Hey u/Arispy! what text fonts do you use at this The Weekly Brawler??

I AM THE SHELLY HERE

Boss went god mode!
---
Bro I'm at 5200 with only 2 epics

Because blue is fire is hotter than red fire

Ohhhh okay thanks

Lol 100% true

Yes

good father.

I'm at 5200 with 2 epics

I was hoping that the new music would blast at some point and they would all run away
---
Any tips for the metal scarp boss fight?
---
At least you can heal when you do damage
---
Can you tell pls legendary % drop?
---
You meant SICKO MODE
---
Nope I‚Äôm at 8,750 with everything 
---
Boss went SICKO MODE

This is way too relatable

Wow so great! What a pro play!
---
r/thiccochet 
---
Same, Im at 4500 and i got today piper she is lvl 11 power lvl 1 lol
---
i get 1 shot on insane 1 furious mode. its pretty bs because as soon as you spawn you are battered with like 5 rockets and a million other robots. and tjen he does the lazer thing which is impossible to get out of
---
Sucks to be you big dog
---
lol
---
I swear I thought Brawlstars memes started appearing on r/okbuddyretard for a while and then I saw I was not browsing that sub anymore. Didn't realise until like 4 comments down

Unfortunately, that is just the nature of the game right now. There's nothing we can do about it, but you can always try some things in Practice!

Darryl is OP

I made a post making fun of the mods

Made a post making fun of how r/brawlstars mods remove everything
---
22. Cory
---
He‚Äôs very difficult to use, but if you know how to play him (according to KairosTime) he‚Äôs #1 best brawler in bounty and very strong in showdown 
---
Yes I am. Your acting surprised that you used an exploit to your advantage and got punished
---
mortis gang rise up, its nighttime üåôü¶á my dudes
---
I may be one of the few wives that is excited to get Brawl Stars gems for a gift instead of real gems. ü§£
---
Worth it
---
Oh... :'DD
---
Wdym?
---
I‚Äôd rather have a map full of them than all maps full of Shelly and bull tho 
---
Thanks !

Thank you spooder 
---
understandable bro üëçüëçüëçüëçüëç
---
You're right, my 2000 trophies aren't enough. 
---
I'm pretty sure you've got a gem in Lady K as well. True Love indeed.
---
These changes will allow for a more aggressive and active play style so he will be getting his super more often. 
---
Cool flex but ok
---
maybe not as they didn't ask for 120 gems for golden rico becoming king thicco
---
Cuz you want to push different types of brawlers that are better in different circumstances
---
Np üòä
---
Believe me, at one point its only frustrating to play him 
---
I didnt have any tan skin color so I had to make the best of what I had
---
But Darryl doesn't have a mouth. By what means does he eat?  :thinking:
---
Why tf r/lostredditors ? I mean the photo has Spike he knows exactly where he is
---
I'm old and not really sure what that means.... But ok.
---
No idea. I can‚Äôt get past master
---
K
---
What‚Äôs his tag?
---
i respect your choice and its better for you fam as there are ups and downs and they should not be affected publicly by you downs or you getting into controversial stuff affect them 
---
If you have a Leon let him get all power ups
---
Get a Pam and a Colt
---
That's awesome.
---
Not after that Leon offer
---
Sadly, no ;-;

I remember there is a droid from star wars that turns into a ball and has 2 guns. I forgot the name but I get dreminded of it every time I play him 
---
And then some Spike comes chasing you and expects to live on 1 health and then you heal, killing the Spike entirely.

I always thought Leon was with Bo and Nita.

What happened to Bull lol

Crow is most fun because of his control potential and annoyance factor but his damage output is so low he depends a lot on his teammates. Think he will probably get buffed later when more ppl are using and the numbers start to indicate that a change is needed. 
---
Leon is still sort of OP but also not really depending on how you use him and he will probably go through more changes in future. He‚Äôs probably your go-to if u like assassin/predator-like brawlers like mortis and Darryl 
---
Spike is most balanced and has decent damage output, a powerful crowd control Super and star power. He shouldn‚Äôt have much more changes apart from tweaks to suit the meta. Probably the most practical legendary which can be used in all game modes
---
Don‚Äôt think too much about the OP thing cos even if they were OP when u bought them they will be nerfed eventually. Just buy the one that u think You‚Äôll enjoy playing.

I don't know even where to start with you, I mean, do you even know what you're talkin' to?

I've personally never seen Nita's team, does it happen that often? Sounds like a pretty bad idea for a Nita to team with most others lol
---
Two things:
---
One. Did any of your teamates have about 10k?
---
2. Mabye... i dont know, push every brawler and not just a few? That may also be why you didnt have a chance.

This isn't something exclusive to randoms. We've all made mistakes and it's close-minded to think this only happens to a selective group.

Hey Brawl Stars
---
! I have a new brawler concept!
---
He will be called Thorn(cause Spike is already taken).He will be a thorny porcupine guy! He will have 3900 HP. His Normal attack will throw 3 thorns from his hands like Crow! Each one will deal 500 damage! at lvl 1. His super will be that he will(explode? ) kind of exactly like crow releasing thorns in every directions! Of course he will not fly and will not move with his super! His super will be like Leon and cannot be aimed to throw! Each thorn will do 500 damage!
---
And enemies will be pushed back 
---
His star power: Enemies hit by his Super will  get either poisoned like crow or slowed down like shelly star power! I think both will just work fine ! And it maynot make a huge deal!
---
For his speed! His speed will be like of Nita's!
---
Unload speed will be Fast like Taras! 
---
Reload speed will be negotiable!
---
Sorry, can't see it
---
Well that means at my trophy level it is tank meta... sorry I didn't note I only had 3 k trophies. 
---
perfect concept
---
Thank you. I got the idea while playing pool.

I played 2 month. My friend played 1 month, he have all mythic , super rare, rare and two epics
---
Rattlesnake, rattlesnake, rattlesnake, [rattles me](https://youtu.be/Q-i1XZc8ZwA)
---
Ryan has confirmed that he is still a mythic.
---
It's a super rare
---
That‚Äôs actually what it is
---
No its like that because supercell dont want us to know wat rarity is
---
Mythic
---
Today you fucked up that Jessies cannon is a dog?
---
Sorry, I play since 2 weeks :/
---
Okay thank you for information 
---
It is a mythic.Ryan confirmed it on twitter.
---
In photo looks like will be a super rare
---
Yeah it does but they set it wasn‚Äôt meant to be, they are fixing it so it‚Äôs red
---
Well i have a mini acc 200 trophis and i got leon on it...
---
No, he is going to be mythic. 
---
Oh yea tru that‚Äôs right hahah forgot bout that
---
Look at his background, does that look red or blue? 
---
Yes 
---
I don't have it from a website
---
It's a placeholder. Ryan has confirmed he is going to be a mythic. 
---
Oh no!!!! 
---
OK thanks.
---
Do u think that gene is going to be legendary or mithic? 
---
Get both üòÜ
---
You really are determined to bring back the old skins aren't you :p
---
Also, I would replace Mortis with Ricochet, since old Mortis looks too similar to current in terms of colour scheme and wouldn't be noticeable in a match.
---
he must be hungry for macdonalds and too much macdonalds produce foolish teammate
---
Captain obvious

Im saying it because everyone is saying its super rare based on the background color dip shit

Not the face! Ohhhhhh my mommy!!!! lol!!! üòÇ
---
Gene isn‚Äôt even a mythic...
---
‚ÄúHigh‚Äù probably works better

HAHA SUCH HUMOR OMG LOL HAHA LITERALLY DYING HAHA OMG ROFL LMAO HAHAHAHA üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Everybody has teaming in another way, when you corner somebody with another player even if you didnt spin you have teaming with someone. Yes sometimes its disgusting but teaming is a part of the game or just dont play solo sd.
---
Hard to decide who actually got woooshed xd
---
When mommy doesnt want you
---
Thanks saw that just a mknute after i wrote that. üòä
---
Don't know what's that spinning all about
---
Yeah I thought that aswell
---
This is not the old ui
---
The real ui was when the game was vertical
---
Don't auto aim with dynamike lmao
---
*Who?*
---
Piper wants to checkout colt‚Äôs gun üòÜ

Go to flairs and pick ur favourite brawler
---
Had enough bro?
---
what are you on about
---
Am I missing something?  
---
It's a bug
---
Click on it
---
I want a Brock soldier skin, demoman Mike, engineer Jesse and a spy Leon...
---
Sorry I like tf2 too much
---
Yep! he's a mythic alright.
---
Can I have your recording setup pleaseeeeee
---
omg so nice
---
Man, it looks amazing! Also, do u think it is worth it to buy Pam and Rico for 189 gems?
---
He has seen some shiet
---
It really isüòÅ
---
I m sorry, just check it now . 
---
It never looked like a clickable. Was looking like some kind of tag. 
---
Darryl is strong. Why would you post this? 
---
Coming soon background
---
Ok thanks
---
Happened to me to, but with angry boss
---
Um there are
---
Gene will be a mythic brawler, the blue background is probably because it‚Äôs coming soon
---
more Gene is next to of Tara and no next to of pam 
---
He's a mythic brawler... background isn't right
---
 I already poointed it out
---
shldve edited it to say beautiful instead of disgusting
---
Are there anyways that I can get it then?
---
Switch Primo and Darryl's head and you got yourself a fucking meme
---
When we are talking especially about 1 brawler, the phrase "brawlers should be balanced to keep the game healthy" then it implies that you mean that he is already balanced, you should just add to the sentence that you dont mean crow 
---
LMMAOOO
---
I mean, if he had unlocked EVERY brawler, that is reasonable. But he is at 1.7k, so there is no point I think...
---
Once you login with mainland China IP address, this game will mark your device by iCloud Keychain, even you change your IP address later, the SuperCell ID button won‚Äôt appear. The only way to solve this problem currently is erase and reset your iPhone.

This post was made by the Mortis gang.
---
Boss drops them sometimes in the insane stages 
---
Why do people team, just why...
---
Boss went Thicco Mode!
---
You noob
---
No it is part of the game if two people want to team that's fine it's when big groups are teaming then it is a problem. 
---
no five !
---
Awesome
---
Wtf
---
He is mythic O.O
---
Its so food but its gonna cost like 1500 gems and im never gonna get it
---
Looks amazing! I love the mini gun to!!!
---
Just mythic

---
Turret Time
---
ah thank you
---
I think its dumb because you are essentially making it harder for yourself to progress. I think people are doing it because of gene but the chance to pull him is like from 0% to 0.02% ..wow great. Not worth it. 
---
The box goes *BOOM*!!!!!!!!
---
It could be evento better with some details on his weapon to make it looks like a tiki or totem hammer
---
You never know what might happen
---
:( 
---
(btw i just noticed your username and r/dankmemes likes it)
---
And with some tatoos on his skin
---
Yup, Flying El Primo is best El Primo
---
Half of the brawlers are useless in showdown anyway lol
---
Yeah. But I remember seeing a video somewhere that the developers were interested in adding a Map Creator.
---
Hopefully, that will be a reality in the future.
---
True you can just kersplode the safe from behind the wall as dynamike
---
Wrong format bro
---
Downvoted
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure gene refers to himself as fidget spinner.
---
Bro how did you put primo next to your name ? 
---
In my opinion, trophies don't Say nothing about your true skill. I'am 7300 trophies and several times I've won 10,000+ trophies users
---
And if I get another brawler that isn't Genie, i don't care just better for me either way
---
I am very confused
---
It's impressive that he can make it to insane 4 with random people.
---
Okay makes sense it only just got released globally in December correct
---
He arrives 2 days before my bday and 2 days after my brothers bday
---
A worthwhile skin
---
It could be better named as cosmic tara. 
---
Facts: do you guys know that tara in hindi (Indian language) means stars ‚ú®. 
---
Brock was laggin'*
---
Please read reddit before you post shit on it, it‚Äôs a mistake both Frank and Ryan have confermed that.
---
WRYYYYYY
---
Errrr thats your personal opinion. I feel like the new change to heist maps where theres no walls blocking the safe really made a new long ranged brawler meta in heist. Plus seriously, throwers???theres not even that many walls next to your safe. Just play a long ranged brawler and destroy the throwers. And might i add that twist and shoot is one of the only thrower viable maps for heist and the barley super nerf pus the fact that like i said long ranged brawlers can shred through throwers due to the lack of walls makes throwers terrible in heist. and u want the map removed.....
---
Bull or el primo arent a question either since by utilizing the bushes correctly you can ambush throwers.
---
Yes he is 
---
No wait not stack damage, just 3 ticks for 3 feathers.
---
Basically for now it works like this: if you have 3 people in front and u shot 1 feather each, you will deal damage and poison damages to each and everyone of them.
---
While if you hit 1 guy or even 1 box with 3 feathers point blank you do not get 3 ticks, this makes no sense. 
---
Crow was designed to deliver 50% of the damage with the hit and rest 50% in posion.
---
If a feather hits for 300 hits it will tick 3 times for 100. 
---
Therefore hitting with 2 feathers should trigger a 200 tick and 3 feathers a 300 ticks.
---
Otherwise there is no difference between hitting a guy point blank or from the distance, whereas a Bull a Shelly or a Darryl will destroy you point blank.
---
Literally every solo showdown game : Enemy : sees me and a another who is clearly the bigger threat.
---
Enemy: Attacks me and ignores the other guy coming to kill him, gets closer, still refuses to engage anyone but me, main thing for him is I die, then dies instantly after because of ignoring other guy..
---
do NOT be a gem carrier mortis, it forces your team to fight a 2v3 or risk losing gems
---
Supercell confirmed it to be a mythic
---
Don't listen these salty guys, it's a nice gameplay
---
Calm yo ass out boi 
---
That's gotta hurt!
---
Matchmaking wasn't based off trophies when you were below 3000 trophies
---
Just say, are doing it manually with text editor, or using software?
---
well you know that those numbers arent alot so youre good at math
---
It's so true that I'm crying
---
Can confirm I unlocked spike from a blue box while he was in my shop. My shop updated with crow offer. So now I have spike and crow.
---
Haha did you just delete that? 
---
Bad idea soo boring 
---
thats nothing special this always happens on that map and you could have just as well died at the start to the other bull who would then get all those kills too
---
He is mythic. Supercell confirmed that he is a mythic, and frank said he is mythic despite the confusing color
---
its the curse of the pam
---
Have you ever considered that its just supercell bwing sneaky???
---
As you can plainly see, gene is between frank and crow. There is literal in game footage showing him bwing mythic plus the fact that an awesome super that he has wouldnt make him be classified under super rare
---
Hahaha
---
I dont know him because I never play on duo showdown
---
Very cool!
---
My dude got the biggest yeet of his life
---
Brooklin 99 anyone?
---
Text editor is software
---
Yeah, with the current offer most people are getting their lowest (rarity) available brawler. I have all but legendaries and Mortis and he‚Äôs in my shop atm.

You're sitting here with all of the brawlers except rico, while I have rico and I still need Tara, Pam and all of the legendaries xd

Said it was a huge issue for Heist then we get this TRASH with another set of issues.
---
Since it was released to the US
---
you had the most powerboxes and won. I dont see whats special about that
---
Yeah, but you did post a video of said game, and the team you played was utter garbage, the colt was terrible 
---
Primo needs a buff too!
---
But why
---
Not technically a backstabber but close
---
I play the game as well and we like the game's art style and theme!
---
He says thank you!
---
Haha that's what I meant by smart teaming
---
Because you have just 2000 trophies
---
That would be epic
---
Bro. No offense but you did too much math and research for a post that everyone didn‚Äôt read all of
---
No? I made it myself 
---
Thank you!
---
I dont think theyre going to do anything for soft launch anniversary. The anniversary will almost certainly be the global launch date.
---
I feel ya. If they really wanted to do that they should get another premade.
---
Well i didn't buy him

I'm playing since the global release and I've never experienced life leech, but I know what it is. I agree, that this needs to come back.

 It took about a day.  
---
The clay sticks well together. 
---
Useless, at least now. Dude, there are 20 brawlers, not that hard to scroll
---
I am genuinely curious as to why it‚Äôs blue
---
I see no reason for it, the rest of the card doesn‚Äôt look any different to the other locked brawlers, the only difference is genes face and the blue.
---
Why is it blue?
---
Back ground says he will be released. That blue isn't the same blue of a super rare
---
It said its a glitch on Twitter it's a mythic 
---
Seen it before tho
---
I don‚Äôt team but I know that it‚Äôs not aver leaving so I don‚Äôt whine about it. Especially since supercell has said that they see it as a valid strategy.

No

I doubt there will ever be a need for this, this game has room for lots of brawlers but not enough to crowd the selection screen.
---
Wait for a legendary
---
Dope af
---
It‚Äôs been confirmed for weeks....
---
Pam is one of the strongest brawlers in the game right now, so I think it‚Äôs a good idea. HOWEVER, I am pretty sure there will be a gem offer for Gene when he is released, so maybe you should wait for that if you like him better. Both seem very logical!
---
"d'jinnn" what

Shelly: My friend

Gene: me ;-;

Shelly‚Äôs super says otherwise

/r/notaglobe

No.

NOOOOO MY 502 GONNA LOSE A TROPHY!? The grinding horror! :'(

And ten you get teammed on by everyone and lose.

it's not a super rare background, it has not background actually
---
Ohh.... So I aint getting stuff beocuse the boxes r angry at me! haha! I should have known! :D
---
She looks like a really unique brawler, i'd love to see her in game (though she needs a nerf to her super tbh)
---
Btw, i think you made a little spelling mistake, her attack should be called "canto" (sing) not "canta" (she sings).
---
Wow at first I thought he was going to be mythic then I saw the background and I got my hopes up.
---
Don‚Äôt do it! He‚Äôs just jealous of gene
---
And your a fucking dick

Very nice map... u misspelled *death

he's not a super rare he's a mythic

I won

It‚Äôs a flat amount 
---
Literally teamers on both sides shooting the crap out of each other hahaha
---
Thought it ended day before genie comes out? 
---
Bull, pam and colt are the best combo, what do you mean?
---
If you are not f2p and want them then yes. Pam could be nerfed but who knows
---
You killed a bull who you had more powerpoints than after they got wounded and wasted ammo on a brock, and on top of that the bull was manual aiming and misssd half their damage on their shots. 
---
How does that translate to OP? That‚Äôs just butchered by the bull
---
He‚Äôs a Mythic
---
Where‚Äôs the map? Also, don‚Äôt just asks the devs to add the map, it‚Äôs kinda rude.
---
Well I did it ur way and it helps, thanks

Being close to a dynamite is safer than being far because it‚Äôs harder for him to aim.

It‚Äôs team or be teamed on pal. Don‚Äôt play showdown if you don‚Äôt like it.
---
I won
---
If gene is a support brawler, shouldn't poco and pam be too?
---
It was never a bug and there‚Äôs no reason for them to fix it as it isn‚Äôt breaking the game or causing issues. 
---
Nice! I got spike 2 days ago. He‚Äôs a fun brawler to play as! :) 
---
I agree, but I also don't care if I lose trophies. 
---
I'm not gonna say you got that from me but
---
AAAA
---
No, it isn't.
---
And this has been posted at least 100 times before
---
Why are you stacking boxes ? In prep for the new brawler release?
---
I‚Äôd open it and get some Nita power points and 14 coins 
---
Yeah I saw him in shop two times and both times I was so close to buy him, but I said to myself I will get him from a box sooner or later. I didnt expect to get him now so I got so surprised. :‚Äô)
---
They killed themselves because they can‚Äôt possibly win with someone playing spike
---
I bought it the day it came out. Rip
---
YOU'VE GOT SO MUCH TO LIVE FOR
---
Well he does jump, but yeah would make sense, I presumed that other brawlers would probably be able to, but I've seen a lot of players not utilising it, and it's not mentioned anywhere so why not let those who don't know the tip, know the tip
---
ok den
---
Yeah
---
Yes he has good health, but he gets shredded by long and short range brawlers. His damage isn‚Äôt the best as well. He trades his stats to get a really good super. But even his super can be avoided or cancelled.
---
You mean so much to shoot for 
---
What does ‚Äú) mean?
---
why so much hate?
---
I think rework would be good. I dont know what type but I think it is the best option. I dont like the fact that she wins every 1v1 even when facing much stronger opponents in showdown.
---
Boss is like ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt even my final form!‚Äù
---
This is all patched now don‚Äôt worry
---
1.6k here with no epic mythic or legendaries

NANI?!
---
Hey Kairos!
---
I respectfully disagree on some aspects of what you have said. I think of teaming in solos as a meta. You can't really prevent players from playing according to the current meta, for example, playing Piper on heist. I think the only way for the teaming situation to change is for teaming to be out of the meta. So while I don't think they should ban players for teaming, I agree that the right course of action is to take teaming out of the meta by adding a modifier like you said. I believe life leech was very good at doing this. Also I think that while teaming may make solo showdown a bit stale, I don't really think it is bad for the game. It is a fairly good way to push trophies. That being said, I have more than 5 times as many wins in duos than in solos, so I guess I'm not the most informed person on the issue. Anyways, keep up the great work and make sure to take care of your family! I'm sure you heard this a lot, but I got really scared for you when I heard you were going full-time! Not that I doubt your YT capabilities or anything. Just always have a backup plan! Wow I kinda just wrote a whole paragraph... Oh well!

Btw Pam is already Jessie‚Äôs mom confirmed. So... Jessie and Colt are siblings?
---
Not darryl, he would bounce back, it‚Äôs filled of walls, it‚Äôs better for bull
---
Shelly, Bull, and El Primo would dominate this map. It's actually perfect for that type of brawler.
---
1) The map is composed of halls with entrances in and out of one square hall route into another. This makes the battlefield closed instead of open. Close range brawlers shine in closed battlefields, as movements become more predictable, and they always have obstacles to use to their advantage.
---
2) The spawns are very close together as well, so an El Primo/Bull/Shelly would instantly have a target in a good range to go after. Even if the target runs, that gifts them the huge amount of boxes in the area. With how quickly these brawlers can harvest boxes, that's still a good outcome. 
---
Like a smiling face
---
Perfection!
---
Soo epic 
---
Yeah I wish they had a report system. I would definitely report you for going spike in boss fight. They most likely gave up because your genius choice of going spike will make it impossible to win.
---

Me when i see this format again:
---
Not again...

How do you even do that? You just play at the same time and hope you‚Äôre together?
---
Best mortis matchups dynamike barley colt rico frank jessie (early game) penny bo and sometimes poco. 
---
For spike or brock the problem is getting close to them without them noticing, it‚Äôs super easy to 3 shot but it‚Äôs also super easy for them to just stay away from you, especially at the level I play at where everyone knows to check bushes and all that. Also, brock takes 4 shots (I usually wait for a teammate to tap them so that I can 3 shot though) and if spike has super he can autoaim it to instantly heal 500 hp and an additional 500 hp ever second after.

Okay if you do this bottom of the line you‚Äôre a scumbag, you can‚Äôt even argue it so don‚Äôt even try.

Best thing is to use your highest power level so you got the star power but some people don‚Äôt have a lot of options to choose from and for my unfortunately it‚Äôs primo who‚Äôs power 10 so I‚Äôll use him as he‚Äôs my highest, sure he‚Äôs not the best in boss fight but we can still win as I beat insane 2 with a crow and spike. So no it‚Äôs not impossible if you play smart so if you give up then you‚Äôre just being a baby
---
Why do people always blir out the names???
---
I know but they can change them with something other
---
Love when this happens. It‚Äôs way better if it‚Äôs not the final showdown because you both place lower and can‚Äôt win.
---
Darryl is the best watch coach corys vid
---
The best part is that you can quit him one gun and It becomes in a rico skin
---
Me too
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs so that people don‚Äôt try to friend them.

https://discord.gg/brawlstars here you will fin a community of people who share strategies. Official announcements are also there. You can find some good teammates in the looking fir group section
---
OH NO HES HOTTTT
---
Not impossible, you‚Äôre just a scumbag that quits when things get hard
---
Well if you lack only Dyna and Bo, it means you're still &lt;2k trophies. So I will probably go for it since, as said previously, this will mean an easy increase (easily 400/500) in trophies and then you can unlock the last two.
---
Yeah, they look nice as decoration.

OoOh SwEetY

they‚Äôre probably trying to get as many tokens possible for Gene who‚Äôs coming in 4 days

I didn‚Äôt know that existed

Who won?

U dont have same brawlers as me!

U r soo ducking dumb

No shit. It was revealed that it was a mythic weeks ago

I mean the whole subreddit is wondering about genes rarity. But in the patch notes from the app store it tells that gene is mythical...

Thinking you pulled a legendary and getting legend elixir

Wrong account?

Can you help me with insane 3 I can‚Äôt find anyone to play with
---
EL√çT!!! My guy
---
Lol it‚Äôs funny when people call these UI ‚Äúold‚Äù. the real old ones are portrait things but this is prettymuch portrait‚Äôs all features shaped into landscape. Real features came after this update
---
Yes, they do...
---
I though that too but after i played with my friends it was incredibly fun and now it's my favourite game mode
---
Firstly it‚Äôs a joke, second it‚Äôs supposed to call out those people that complain a lot.
---
Lol that was so funny though
---
His background suggests super rare.  The lack of a 3rd mythic suggests mythic, and the post confirms it.
---
Cuz there on minimum
---
No there on max
---
yeah, he has to join his robot brothers
---
Cloaq: Idk I‚Äôm just lucky AF
---
This meme was truly a golden experience
---
Nice, I found the asymmetrical layout quite original!
---
I only said about royale is cuz it‚Äôs supercell‚Äôs game, I wouldn‚Äôt mind an update every tuesday for this but the good parts of the update were kept for later this time, just cuz they had a time on it, doesn‚Äôt mean it keeps me playing, in fact I would‚Äôve played more had it been released with everything tbh, and it‚Äôs actually buying them more time to make another update in the future so they wouldn‚Äôt have to do another one so quick. Make a smaller one and release it parts so you buy yourself time to make another or release it all in one and start working on something new
---
YAAAAAS
---
Who do you use? Always get teamed up with a colt, so I'm guessing that's a good choice
---
Legit just happened to me üíÄ
---
The SU reference, Nice
---
No you didn‚Äôt you need to use bull!!
---
Hate seeing games get like this, yes maybe spike isn‚Äôt a great pick but you are still allowed to pick whoever you want lmao. If you‚Äôre going into a game w a random don‚Äôt get butt hurt and
---
quit when they don‚Äôt pick a specific brawler that you want them to play. And I totally understand people who want to take it more seriously, but There is discord and a competitive brawl stars sub reddit that you can focus more on comps and finding people to play with. At the end of the day it‚Äôs still just a fun free game and people shouldn‚Äôt feel forced into any meta.
---
The design is too close to Poco‚Äôs. Maybe she should be red?
---
10904 getting close to 11k!
---
This is what her star power was supposed to be for all along
---
It is based on brawler trophies and total trophies, do you expect to face people with 200 trophies less because they have the same lvl brawler as you. If it was based on brawler level you could get to 700 trophies if everyone has lvl 1 brawlers
---
Not yet
---
why did i laugh so hard watching this
---
IKR lmao he didnt even have a chance to move before he was instakilled
---
1/10, I almost never see camping bulls at 11k
---
Good on you for not teaming 
---
thanksüòÅ

Waiting about min waiting for the video to start then notice it was a picture.

It also works as a deterrent for enemies to get near her when she supers.  Since it also slows down her walkspeed, I felt there needed to be another thing to counteract someone just running up to her (in solo situations).  Perhaps the self buff is enough?  You could be right though, I'll think about it.
---
Nice!
---
( Õ°o Õú ñ Õ°o)
---
As beautiful as always, Question, Will there be colored version? 
---
It is now based on total account trophies, not character trophies. It fixes the exploit.
---
Wow, congrats brotha! Whos yer fav champ to play?
---
Everything look really good, but in Bounty there're 2 map types, desert and jungle, rest looks ok.
---
Cringed hard but good editing none the less

Total trophies my guy

Or:

---
Cringy
---
I‚Äôm starting to think that some people on this sub live under a rock 
---
That is a placeholder background. Gene is a mythic. Frank has confirmed it on Twitter and it is also in the update notes on the play store.
---
this whole sub is a fucking fever dream
---
I haven‚Äôt played with him since december 
---
Says the one with a Rico flair that is supporting the Shelly gang.
---
Trophy exploit got nuked. Makes total sense
---
I mean, Piper got 2nd so that's something noteworthy...
---
What if I told you I think teaming is healthy for the game and should stay? Would you be mad, because I do feel that way.
---
Teamwork for the win
---
Yes he is a myrgic they just messed up the color
---
Yeah and in feast or famine too
---
He doesn't look like a super rare! 
---
XD
---
For iphone yes use their screen recorder (unless someone has had better success with something else?), andriod use Mobizen.
---
Did we just see Poco get fucking Impaled
---
Because you all were trophy grinding with low level characters, it got nuked.
---
Oh I have iOS 
---
I mean he certainly *could* have, but Rico is more to blame imo
---
That was insane 1
---
u/vreddit_bot
---
Grab a snickers dude, you're not you when you're hungry
---
Super Rare, Epic and Mythic chances are static as far as I know. Only legendary pull rates changes
---
Supercell just messed up the color
---
So.... basically a black haired patty mayonnaise with super powers? 
---
If you could queue with duplicate brawlers then don‚Äôt think I wouldn‚Äôt try it out cause it‚Äôs still possible just harder and I‚Äôm not gonna just give up cause the odds are against me
---
this was genuinely painful to read
---
Better. Much better!
---
Please bring it back!
---
No I actually do, whenever I bring it up people either use insults such as kid, trash, or nerd, or they make some type of disabled joke... but I actually like teaming and think it‚Äôs a good unplanned mechanic in BS
---
You should have healed
---
This would've been right before the update
---
STOP
---
I hate those teammates
---
 üòâ
---
Well why‚Äôd you post this saying its bullying when it‚Äôs not lmao

Yes.

His head just a bit weird

Same im at 8146 and no legendaries

Ive been playing since day three of release
---
The sign should say: Stop teaming
---
It's because spinach

I imagine they'd both be spitting out gems, or it would alternate to ensure fairness and less rdm quality

https://www.reddit.com/user/phlorpe/comments/anv5zk/fanmade_brawler_concept_contest_details/
---
I got a couple of pro players and other veterans judging the concepts, and the winning concept will get the phlorpe treatment.
---
Yeah fair enough, I guess it really depends on what events you prefer playing.  Not all brawlers do well in SD, but do well in others.
---
You're just as smart as that colt 
---
Untrue, Shelly can super Darryl to pieces and Mortis can just chip at darryl and run away and repeat.
---
 
---
Thank you.
---
haha
---
Uhhh... just because they buffed him doesn‚Äôt mean he can start soloing the boss? Wtf?
---
Upload as image I think. I use it from mobile, I don't know if it's different in PC
---
I once scored an auto goal but that's nothing compared to this
---
they are angry because they do not win brawlers
---
Same but I can easily afford the gold one
---
One pumpkin spice latte coming right up

Lmao 
---
Where's thicco mode?

**A N G E R Y B O X!**
---
Yeah but it could also be fake
---
Just sayin
---
Box is ANGRY!
---
This is too good
---
Range nerf but dagger spread decreased and slightly increased poison damage 
---
Actually don‚Äôt, it could go 1 of 2 ways, get completely obliterated or use the super to shatter them
---
He had to edit it cause he couldn't risk getting his phone destroyed
---
Emotes are needed in this game üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Club Wars Solo Showdown style for the trophies!
---
Chill issa joke r/woooosh
---
yw
---
oh that gave me an idea, a Brazilian Indian Bull Skin 
---
Quick! Go to r/lootstars and make this instant gratification a misery compared to others
---
Yes until I found out everyone had it. Like I thought after the update there were many more skins and I randomly got this. I want a Barley skin to spend the gems I'm collecting on it. (Already got the golden)
---
# üòÇ
---
Nice. 
---
The joke isn‚Äôt very obvious and you wasted the random‚Äôs time by being a useless brawler in Boss Fight. Make a better joke next time.

pastel clay 
---
 Thank you.  
---
But this is a hobby! 
---
So like then it can be like opening a box and getting new characters every time and it could be like carriers for them
---
YES YES YES YES YES
---
If it is manually claimed then DONT appeal it because it might give your channel a strike (3 of them and your channel gets deleted), if it was automatically claimed and you know it was a mistake then by all means go for it
---
Snipers?
---
No, he's to cute to be a pimp
---
Wrong
---
Wait some people actually agree with this? What if you get ganged up on and can't just go and get more than 9th. I'd be glad to have as much rewards as possible.
---
Well, that's your thoughts, but I won't argue.
---
Leon.
---
What? What are your legendary odds?
---
Completely unnecessary, suggested every week. Probably won‚Äôt be assed for a while. 
---
Whaat I want them to add is different profile pics for skins, this is something similar to that.
---
Wait, is he the scout?
---
I love how Shelly is cropped in on the bottom picture because the guy who made it couldn‚Äôt get #1 as shelly
---
I feel as though the super is too powerful
---
Cringe and cope tbh
---
I see
---
What trophy level you at?
---
Ok that was beautiful 
---
3,6k with 22/22 wroom wroom
---
Oh no, when he went god mode he was only using 0.00027% of his power
---
Nah I actually had to because I couldn't find a picture online but it looked neater without the name and cropping it made it a similar size to the other pictures. But good observation xD
---
Opened it and got nothing. Bought more, still nothing. I‚Äôm at 4500+ trophies without an epic.
---
Honestly with the kind of shit she can pull off with her super, I would also do the same.
---
If I see a Morris say A I will flip out
---
HOLY

This guy probably thinks he is some god at gaming and knows everything there is to strategy and skill
