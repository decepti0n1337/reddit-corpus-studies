Totally agree. It would be more funny

A run to mid map with only 2 entraces big yikes
---
You clearly have not faced a good Mortis player.
---
You'll get kick out of the game and all your gem will be lost
---
I'm not exactly sure, but I think you may get Shelly.
---
it does work if you click it before matchmaking startd. as soon as you've been put into a agme you cant leave. so if you are fast enough, it works

Should every brawler be similar is their success rate? Like a common brawler and a legendary brawler? If you think that, then why is it that I see mostly every brawler in mostly every game mode? You don't see Mortis being played on most game modes or even maps. You do see Shelly and Bull being played in Gem grab, brawl ball, heist, solo and due showdown. Stop being so naive and turning the other way.

And ammo count
---
Why? How is this low effort or repetetive, or no discussion value? I spent like 30 mins on this, and many people are talking about it.
---
I‚Äôve clicked it multiple times before being matched and still didn‚Äôt let me put
---
In all the situations i've used it, it worked so....
---
As have many, no wonder why this is trending
---
[removed]
---
Well good is an overstatement, he definitely needs a buff but no he‚Äôs not trash
---
You can buy it at any time from the upgrade screen, just won't be on discount
---
Oh ok. I was looking at the top one. 
---
Because there are 2 open slots, and pressing that will request to be in that player‚Äôs lobby
---
If you want easy low trophies wins, stick with bull until it you hit a wall where people won‚Äôt walk into you anymore I suppose.
---
Bo is mildly op. You just need to play him right.if you fire then walk one way , all arrows will hit same target but if you walk other way he has a spread 
---
lmao i have no idea what you're trying to say. its like saying "I drew mario from ssb" and giving them hate because "iTs MarIO nOt SuPer SmaSh BroS1!11!" 
---
I‚Äôm at 3000+ and still haven‚Äôt got any legendarys :(
---
Good for you. He's the one brawler I can't push up. He does very low damage at 1 tile away, and any brawler beats him at this range. And as a player on phone, I'm not 100% accurate with a super.
---
ImO def needs a small buff
---
You should repost this to r/brawlstarscompetitive 
---
I restarted the phone a couple of times and nothing changed, but you wanna hear something crazy? I spent a good 30 minutes looking up and downloading lineage os and the disconnects disappeared :D
---
Btw restarting was a good suggestion, I'll factory reset the phone next (DC's stopped but the phone is still groggy) then swap os if nothing works
---
and lex isnt good at brawl stars lol, he has no idea what hes talking about either
---
Old one looks dumb af! Lmao
---
For a fairly juvenile game, I expected this subreddit to be about jokes and cheats.  Instead, it‚Äôs filled with skillful art and innovative game improvements.

I cannot unsee now.  XD

I fail to see whats wrong with that?
---
The trophies are mostly close to each other
---
Exactly lol
---
Well, Shelly was already perfect, this is Majestic

best one i‚Äôve seen so far!
---
Thank you

Also their phone number to call them if i need help with a Leon or something like that
---
Hello moderator
---
No one is gonna buy it it‚Äôs gonna taste as bad as the character 
---
cette subreddit ne peut pas comprendre la francais 
---
To be honest all of these methods of getting power points and coins that are being recommended are super unnecessary.  It takes only about a year and a half to max an account.
---
People can finally understand what type of personality he also has! Even without voice acting!
---
Yoooooo, I just watched your OJ video
---
Im proud of u son
---
Tara i think
---
Try Bull cereal
---
That's really mind blowing. Very good job!
---
Is she crawling in the bushes?
---
It‚Äôs so strong, i can‚Äôt see players that play in cavern churn ad don‚Äôt use the walls, it‚Äôs an idiot thing
---
When u enter brawl ball with the wrong character and immediately realize it and hit exit with 1/6 only to watch the players go up 1 by 1 until ur at 6/6 and are stuck with it
---
I want to avoid confusion, so I'll put this is a form everyone can understand. 
---
Small nerf good because over-nerf bad. If small nerf no work, more small nerf needed. 
---
So, having different skin won't make him bit stronger practically?
---
Took 8 minutes and 26 seconds
---
I got 20 when I just ran straight by with primo and scored I think 20 sec maybe like couple secs of but yeah just walked by because their team was nita jessie and poco and two keep trying to go down the wings so I just walked by
---
Are those fidget spinners?
---
Small nerf bad (look at his already small nerf). Big nerf good, over nerf bad.
---
Simple.
---
How so? Is it a command similar to the color commands?
---
I dont think were arguing on the same topic. We are talking about the small 4 tile island in the middle where a brawler could secure himself from melee brawlers if there was a bull already there he would be clearly visible cause there are no bushes and no one would go there until he is dead. If you read all previous statements it is clear we have been talking about the small island in the middle. I like this map it looks pretty cool all im saying is that, that middle island is a game breaker and would guve a free win in the case of a 1v1 of a melee vs darryl crow piper or anyone else that can get into that spot
---
So Lunguini is now an old man, and Remy evolved into a bird

You are a part of it
---
{1} Thinking about the 3D/Leon update until now what do you feel has been done well and what do you think could have been done better?
---
* I love the new 3D look and especially new brawler.. the only thing i dislike is Leon being way too op, needs another nerf!
---
{2} On a scale of 1-10 how interested are you in seasonal/special skins? Bonus internet points awarded for your best idea for a future seasonal skin!
---
* 8.5/10 They are cute and great but they need different attack effects etc.
---
Overall its not bad soo far!
---
{3} Where do you see the future of Brawl esports going and what would an ideal event format look like to you?
---
* Esports for Brawl Stars would be rly fun to watch, it suits the game well bcs its a skill based game and not P2W..
---
{4} You awake one morning to find a Brawl Stars Magic Genie in your room (he took over Darryls barrel...don't ask). You have only ONE wish that can be granted that allows you to add a feature into Brawl Stars. What would you add to the game to make it better?
---
* I would add a ton of things and features since the game is new and just came out fresh and clean.. but one thing i would like to see in future if not possible now.. is campaigns!
---
{5} If you could make a brawler to add to the game, what would be it's attack, super, and star power?
---
* I would like to see another thrower.. his ATTACK would be lighting bolt comin from the sky who would deal a small circle aoe damage (like barleys but a lot faster) with a little delay (similar to Frank but a little less delay) when attacking since bolts are fast and would be too op to hit someone immediatly.... his SUPER would allow him to run super fast trough a wall (not breaking walls).. leaving an energy trail behind him which slows enemies down and deals some damage to them while they are walking over it (think of a Crows poison damage, or brocks super power damage)... his SUPER POWER would increase his speed (would be fast as Crow) when an enemy is nearby (2.5 tiles away from him) and would increase his reload speed too..
---
//or SUPER POWER #2\\ After he goes trough a wall.. when stops he stuns enemies in 3 tile range for 1.8 seconds dealing very little damage...
---
Thanks for reading, have a nice day!
---
Keep improving the game, its a fantastic piece of fun, its favourite to many ppl including me! Im excited to see the future of Brawl Stars! :3 &lt;3
---
The only sad thing in this is that no one has either the Chef Mike or the Santa Mike
---
Who‚Äôs OJ?
---
Excuse me? Nita is the best brawler of all time. Fuck off (550 Trophies Nita)
---
Thanks Fernando, Very cool!

Scoring an own goal counts towards the opponents.

Yea bo needs it
---
I'll link you the vid
---
I mean he‚Äôs an assassin with piper.
---
Jessie is finalized and has been for awhile. She doesn't need a remodel.
---
This is clearly fake, there are at least **3** Dynas teaming in every game.
---
"Accidentally"
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Well, that's how it works lol. If your opponent gets 2 of them then you lose
---
This is the worst drawing I have ever seen. Go learn drawing from somebody. Okay, jokes aside, I like your drawing a lot. I like the way you tried to make it look like bull is hiding in the bush ü§£
---
Yeah, Yarn is part of OJ
---
Bull will kill him before he gets 3 shots in, Shelley for similar reasons, Barely (before Leon gets super, in which case just run to teammates or run away if in solo SD), Dynamike for same reasons as Barely, Bo cause he can still detonate mines, Piper cause range and her super to counter his.  
---
Same goes for clash Royale
---
Star power, they go further each time you bounce them even without star power. They go faster as well but I thinks that‚Äôs just star power.
---
[Dragon Knight Jessie](https://i.redd.it/90z0v51ywab21.jpg)
---
Here's my submission.  Enjoy
---
Yeah yeah, because they are not the ones competing and playing. Of course they would say that, they did say of approving teaming but no to this degree of 6vs1. Typical shitcell doing nothing because they know it will make people angry and tempt them to spend money to get stronger. They already know what is going to happen if they approve of it but money talks
---
It works. You just have an apple phone.
---
We need small tweaks slowly, not meta flips.
---
Because they would)d lose money obviously. If easy win equals why should I spend money if I can win without spending?
---
Is that the only reason why she's good in brawl ball? 
---
I'm already at edge of the map trying to take boxes... Poison cloud didn't even start... enemy leon hits me with 3 bullets hid behind cornerwall to heal and recover ammo... Then suddenly 3 meteor in a row...
---
best to use her while playing with a friend, timing her super with another super with AoE damage can be game winning
---
Oh srry didnt see the link
---
im sorry what
---
Don't you have to enter the name TWICE and then accept ?
---
ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
Love it
---
Thanks Fernando, Very nice!
---
Haha, they don't even care. They can just shut down this game for what I care. Supercell blood runs through their veins, greediness always prevails. And this game is targeted at retarded kids who would ask their parents to spend money in them for this game. They wouldn't put a report button and even if they do put in, it would just be a sham like the exit button
---
Who are you trying to fool.
---
There is a report button...
---
Omg.. This is pure epicness
---
Uhh I'm a bit concerned why you just now made the post even though you got her before the UI update lol, old description and old mythic background.  
---
As some tips she messes up a whole team in gem grab. Just chip her super and near the end of the game try to go for the gem carrier and 2 or more people and just attack asap, then kill them and steal those gems. She's also good in brawl ball with same purpose except saving ball or protecting the ball on the way towards enemy goal.
---
Yes confirmed to work every single time

I want all of them

I'm Android beta and I've been sitting on 9.6k trophies for the past 2 months üò≠

yes

Kite Primo, you‚Äôll be fine. Primo is easy once you learn to play against him a lot. 
---
Outstanding move 
---
Once again: Teaming between random people is seen as a creative new way to play showdown (last thing stated by dev team). 
---
Teaming between people that know each other by name or friends in general is seen as cheating the system... that's why there are ???.

what part of that sounded aggressive

Masterpiece üî•

The picture does not actually show that they are teaming against you. Just because I decide to hit one person and not the other does not mean I'm teaming.

What?

No. Let‚Äôs not try to make brawl stars clash royal

Yeah, Bull is hard to fight. Just stay out of range of his weapon and shoot the bushes to check to see if he is hiding.

Hi Sector!
---
I know im a bit late, but I would want to know where you found the information for the modifiers? 
---
Also, /u/NemGa_ I'm sorry if you wanted to submit this yourself. I did not realize you were also active on this sub. 
---
I wish a Mary Poppins (old one not the 2019 movie) skin for Piper. That cute white dress is lovely! Plus Piper is cheeky like Poppins. 
---
*nice*
---
There is a big one coming for sure it should address a lot of things.
---
Totally agree
---
I hope you like my art(My user name :First‚ö°Blood) https://preview.redd.it/x0bix4cw8ea21.jpg?utm_source=reddit-android&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b34f6c498158c99dffa378dbde75cc025cc9f23c
---
Then just team far away? Why are you being so salty about teaming ? Even SC agree with this method
---
this are is AMAZING! but it misses Pam's turret still amazing though gg xd
---
Invest a few money into the game, such as the 15-25lvl offers
---
Just because a brawler is similar to another doesn‚Äôt mean it should be scrapped. Penny and Jessie both have long range shots, have the same amount of health, and both have a deployable super. Even with those similarities, both stay in the game as two separate characters.
---
Google how to set user flair I don't have "time to explain" it's different on PC and mobile
---
Awesome idea! A 150 gem skin right here
---
Yes some of them wear bowler hats instead
---
ohhh that's hot. he's hot! lol
---
üëå
---
How do you know that for next brawler?
---
he‚Äôs a different brawler, bull is a tank and darryl is an assassin 
---
She says it in Spanish: she says incre√≠ble
---
T H I C C   AF
---
Brakes only create doubt
---
#**remove**
---
Someone should post it up on reddit for fact checking 
---
Nita is girl ???
---
A idea that looks good and that would also work well
---
Add some walls though. A map like this would be not good for any brawler except long range ones.
---
Break some wall waves from middle and add some more walls in a plus formation
---
Lile there should be walls completely down. So add some walls keeping plus as a template
---
We should make it that You have to play 5 games as a normal brawler and after these 5 You can choose to be boss. Because in that way the randomnes goes away and You don‚Äòt need to worry about beeing a boss with a 20% chance. Because some brawlers are much better as a boss. And the relation stays the same. 5 games as a normal Brawler and than 1 Game as a boss. You can decide when to play that one game maybe
---
I hate you
---
Lol
---
Dat face do
---
It might be, we need to get supercell on this 
---
There's 3+ brawlers for every rarity except mythic. And I may be wrong here, but a 5k brawler on trophy road would make sense for supercell to add. I'm more sure with the mythic one, all speculation thought! :)
---
Ok then that makes sense, just change his attack then. (I‚Äôm not trying to hate on your concept, just trying to help making is better)
---
RNGesus doesnt like people like us :(
---
The foxes number is 666
---
Pams face
---
Why Bull isn't assassin? Same mechanics.
---
Throwers would be OP
---
  
---
But still a good map
---
Jessie is one of my fav characters and you just made her both cuter and cooler at the same time!
---
Oh, well I‚Äôm sorry that I overreacted.
---
Is there a good time to upload the artwork??
---
 Awesome ! :o
---
WAM BAM HERE COMES PAM
---
Umm I‚Äôm unauthorized to tell you that information.
---
That's a long video to sit through buddy, of just repeatedly opens boxes. Maybe 3x it?
---
El Primo jumps into the enemy spawn.
---
Darryl has the passive super charge which allows him to use his super on just one brawler to go for a kill or just to survive by running away, while Bull‚Äôs super needs to be charged regularly so he can‚Äôt use it as often, making him not an assassin. plus darryl can bounce off walls to surprise an opponent with his super, while bull‚Äôs super is predictable
---
Superb cool fantastic üëåüëåüëå
---
Pams a fish now
---
This is looks like Topg from The Last Airbender! Good one!
---
Beautiful 
---
Yikes,  hope you put a big bet on that round 
---
I tried it about 3times, but it didn't changed.
---
Really? it doesn‚Äôt feel normal if all 40 people below me in my clan have epics/mythics/legendaries.
---
Damn i really want that gamemode to be implemented in the game
---
nevermind, I just tested it again and yes, the match (which I deliberately lost immediately) showed up about a minute after the match ended with the timer starting at 0 seconds...that way, I think I don't have a world record or whatever üò≠ thanks for correcting me ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Welcome to the real Brawl Stars
---
Man assasin
---
It should just be like: Its not much but, no its just not much.
---
Anyways it doesn‚Äôt matter cause those modes cycle is the same bounty, heist , brawl ball , repeat
---
And?
---
Btw, brawlers*
---
Its probably whenever the next update is. 
---
Darryl: Bruh.
---
MYYYYY DIA-MONDSSS!!!
---
I love it.
---
Really enjoy the action, Bull looks great!  
---
However having issues with the depth, in particular Darryl. The intended effect is he's spinning into the foreground (yea?) but at first glance he just looks really big in the midground area. Maybe some perspective ground shadows and lighting, as well as sizing could help him "pop". Just an idea
---
And he kills you istant because you have 0
---
It happens sometimes 
---
üòÇsame
---
I'm at 2k and somehow got leon spike and pam
---
Like it
---
I LIKE IT!!! 
---
He said that after i called him that. Good job trying to twist my words
---
I have all brawlers level 5-6  and play at around 450 trophies each, cant team with any except for barley and dyna..
---
I can actually feel the music is playing right in my head when I am starring at the spinning wheel .
---
Thats The yellow Diamond face? 
---
And can a bull get close to throwers and squishy brawlers as easy as mortis?
---
Don't worry, I got your Community reference even if nobody else did
---
Yea XD
---
Is not a good ideea , just beacuse there will be massive teaming between two teams :(
---
BuLl ShIT haHa gEt it??!!! bcz MORtIs shit xdxdxd
---
And thisÔºåthis is a real kind of stuff!
---
Youre t-twelve????!!
---
O_O
---
I just get the brawlers and edited them w the back ground i made, and i am working with a phone app and cant do anything more.
---
‚ÄòBull Temple‚Äô
---
Cool
---
Fits perfect üëåüëåüëå
---
If only shelly had her special ;)
---
Teaming is disgusting
---
Your post has been removed, make sure to use the body of a post to elaborate on the title.
---
Cover to their first comic
---
So satysfiting Killing those Who dare play with him in solo
---
Nah lol, I just put her in the back cause I wanted her to float without obscuring the background too much. And also....SHES MARY POPPINS YALL!!
---
Dem titties bouta slip 
---
How u did that?
---
Shhhh
---
Awesome! Then his super attack would be like a pool of slime
---
Gaming...
---
Nita is definitely not garbage
---
Spoiler: no, she is pretty strong
---
I just basically came 1 and 2 on every match 
---
You're... Twelve? 12?
---
*cries in jealous*
---
i realised his soul mate‚Äôs name is ship
---
Nita is really strong, who said she was garbage ?
---
When you unlock brick at 1k
---
Thank you for your protection supercell.
---
I was noob using her and pretty much in every vid others think she is trash , but i was wrong
---
Hmm
---
Thanks Fernando, very majestic
---
Heeeey! I will participate!
---
What do you mean, the way I set it up is everyone has a free box in front of them, then more boxes in the middle of their ‚Äúquarter‚Äù and the corners with 3 spawns have 4, and the ones with 2 only have 3 to make it more fair.
---
Please not even more bull maps. 
---
No its fun when u get it lol 
---
Very cool fanart of Rico!
---
Gained 47 trophies at once? He just kept hitting Rematch at the end and it adds up when you leave to the main menu.
---
More like they were wrong 
---
Too dispersive...
---
You mean early, right?
---
Not my music. Ask the creators
---
Good concept but the challenge would need zo be hardver and smaller rewards something Like 5% chance of a gem mission
---
That would be hard 
---
35% for a gold mission witch would be genaric (Play 10 Brawl ball maches) and a 60% for a charecter specific one like (use 3 Shelly super in a single life)
---
That is well out of my reach
---
Isn't it el campeon?
---
No, already suggested a lot and won't happen
---
Not if Shelly blows up guitar man first
---
In my ideal world, I would have that  on and anyone else could have it off
---
It‚Äôs really just a way to see if people are autoaiming
---
Downvoted only because of the picture
---
I‚Äôm an invested player, and it still takes me a few tries to get to the feature I want üòÖ Totally lost
---
First, don't use him in open maps. Double Trouble for example
---
Second, use him in Brawl Ball
---
As a what Agro ball carrier
---
Tbh even though this is super cool I would never want to wear it in public
---
We need this A.S.A.P.!!!!!!!! üòç
---
He isn't that good at all. Only in Cavern Churn and Gem Grab, everything else is medium or meh.
---
And, you just made such a good match because you was playing in Cavern Churn, so...
---
how do you make these maps?
---
Ball carrier
---
If I were to level him up now what mode cause there is no brawl ball yet
---
Who is the star player if the boss wins ü§îü§îü§îü§î
---
I Think that Map should be added to game it looks nice
---
Probably gem grab, I don't remember current map but if it has a lot of bushes go for it
---
Well in close situations yes but he depends on good aiming.  I still hate him cus he is OP in bounty and I suck with him ((((
---
Truly an epic gamer moment
---
Ok thx 
---
Says the bull user. You no better than us.
---
Yup
---
ALL OF MY GLORY!!! 
---
I do them using mobile app BS Map Editor. For PC use www.pixelcrux.com
---
ok thanks
---
Thanks!
---
You might want to edit your comment and say nsfw. 
---
The reason i WAS on 3rd...
---
Very nice also green is my fav color :)
---
Now put  those 2 words together. 
---
Reminds me of the Cloud9 logo
---
So were you actually phishing?
---
Wave check!
---
Maybe because OP likes to draw characters like that. He even titled it as ‚ÄúAdult Nita‚Äù
---
He has angry bro üò§
---
[https://i.redd.it/xt7rz5i1wfb21.jpg](https://i.redd.it/xt7rz5i1wfb21.jpg)
---
Nita need to kill someone
---
That's not an excuse haha. People have gotten every single brawler to 500 at lvl 1. Star powers aren't needed. I got the majority of my brawlers above 400-500 with 6-8lvl. It's just practice, not level denomination. Good luck bro
---
Sounds really awesome to me.
---
do this but with barley lol
---
And save your ammo 
---
I get the reference too
---
Now that is a good detail. Good work supercell. Let‚Äôs have more skins like that
---
What‚Äôs a gold name?
---
Good names..
---
I honestly once thought of a new ¬´slimy¬ª brawler called ¬´Bob¬ª. Almost ended up posting it here...
---
ayee.. we might be the most ulucky people in the world
---
Oh ok
---
This bug is pretty stupid. Can't even rematch with same team mates again.
---
That‚Äôs like saying that an airplane is slow compared to a rocket ship. It‚Äôs technically true, but the game still takes a really long time to move forward.
---
What's the background?  Sorry I'm a noob lol.
---
The ppl with 500 lvl 1 brawlers had max teammates to help that person get to 500
---
Why does this remind me of Smash Bros
---
Thank you! :D
---
Some maps have Mike and Barley written all over them lol
---
While that may be true, I know many friends who pushed 500 brawlers in SD as lvl 1. I personally don't like 3v3 and I've gotten far above 400 at lvl 1.
---
Okay, now this is epic
---
I don‚Äôt really see the point in clubs except for being able to talk to other club members and inviting them to an event. Supercell should definitely let you donate power points to other players, like other of their games. 
---
10 / 10
---
Nah, he‚Äôd be way to broken 
---
Two gods must never be mixed 
---
Actually you HAVE to aim Leon shots from medium range, otherwise you'll hit nothing
---
Omg I love it 
---
Story goes: Shelly and outer Leon die. Soon, chaos ensues as Mortis and Leon begin attacking people. Tara supers but dies in the process. Frank supers, a bunch of stuff I don‚Äôt see happens, and me and Jessie are the only survivors. Jessie promptly kills me
---
But it's more like a categorie, so... But i understand what you mean.
---
Um..... Can we address the background?
---
No its not, there would be 2 decently sized icons and when clicked it will show 3 emotes. Also it should be thing u can turn on and off in the settings
---
Excellent original meme
---
He is controling his mind
---
Stolen
---
Stick a fork in me am done
---
Step 2: have event ticket
---
That‚Äôs hot
---
Don't forget hay dayüò´
---
I get triggered whenever someone doesn't metion hay day while metioning boom beach 
---
HD is superior to boom beach 
---
No, the sun doesn‚Äôt shine on me cuz I like to swim deep
---
Furry leon
---
That is intended from supercell so..
---
Supercell will never make a brawler based off a farm animal
---
Beta players had it tougher. I was 8K before my first mythic and I was 10.5K before my first legendary 
---
yep this happend to me as well and i made a post about it as well, this is definitely one of my favorite bugs because it looks so cool üòÇüòÇ
---
Pewdiepie. why?
---
In Spain is around 1K trophies. It is quite difficult xD
---
Idk. Bcuz u live in india and we need more of u guys on our side. The margin is nearly at 100k 
---
8/10
---
Points for looking decent~~but could be better~~, points for effort, and points for being Poco
---
Brawl ball: You can 1v3 just learn how to dribble, and take advantage of your mobility
---
Gem grab: You can always get the first two gems, and just swoop in to collect additional gems, but watch out for shotgunners who may be hiding in side bushes
---
Bounty: Not meta/recommend, but I actually like to play him in  bounty since everybody plays squishy brawlers like Piper or Brock, so just hide in bushes and spam your auto-aim button to kill squishies
---
Ive found with brock if you auto aim up close, you can kill most low health brawlers entirely
---
And I aswell get the refrence 
---
Your. Profile. Reddit. Is entirely you screaming at people pointing out things. 
---
You did not even post anything, now U gtfo.
---
Untitled_Artwork.pdf
---
Recognisable...
---
Finally, a good ship. 
---
PROS:
---
3D Maps
---
A new brawler (despite how broken they are)
---
Most of the various changes.
---
CONS:
---
The UI still needs some work, Im not really sure why it had to change at all but right now it is still a bit unintuitive.
---
Respawn System, in duos the respawn system is a bit broken.
---
Extreme Generalization, I understand that for the sake of the game, it had to be done, but now the game has lost almost all its character imo, I think some of the theme should be added back.
---
Thats normal lol
---
This is a really cool art style!
---
We will get 3 New Brawlers I hope...
---
it could be adjusted so poco pam &amp; leon arent worthless
---
O ok im only 2k trophies and my first seeing this. 
---
So?
---
Kinda looks like Hitler‚Äôs mustache 
---
mmm
---
This comes from another meme where bull or El primo rushes into the opponent's spawn area with all 10 gems and dies. In this meme bull or El primo thinks they have 10 power ups and can take out the whole other team lol. 
---
Theyre fairly easy to get until legendary
---
200
---
Buying Legendaries for coins, it could be a ridiculous amount, like 1million, but having to wait like 1.5 years for a brawler is even more ridiculous.
---
I was wondering how I could prove I wasn‚Äôt reusing screenshots, but friends online and tara being lvl 2 were good ways of it
---
I've got to ask but how do you make these? 
---
The matches would finish in 30 seconds, it wouldn‚Äôt be funny, just annoying
---
Notification!
---
Yes 
---
[This](https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/ah3lov/mast_importantly_math_class_paper_background/?st=JR4439I2&amp;sh=f4168613)  is what I mean
---
same üòÅ
---
I know that I play cr too lmao
---
No offense, but how do you suck at using Bull? All you have to do is find a bush and wait
---
Before they fixed the matchmaking (more than one year ago), at high trophies level you could find double brawlers too. I just had a match with 3 pipers in my team (we lost however)
---
Some people had 3 jessies against 3 jessies in a real match. Guess who won
---
The jessie team won
---
Silex? More like shellex.
---
No one plays dyna in big boss
---
