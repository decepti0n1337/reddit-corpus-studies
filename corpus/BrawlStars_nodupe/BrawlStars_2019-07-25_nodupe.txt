A lot of these are insanely overpowered, but the concepts are good. With some number tweaking many could be viable.
---
I think you are severely underestimating how strong stuns and slows are in a MOBA game like this. Being hit by a slow or stun often means instant death, as it basically paints a huge target sign on you and everyone in the world will instantly shoot you because they know you can't dodge.
---
Shelley's is by far one of the most overpowered, it's literally her original Star Power except now it's applied to her normal attacks too. And most people can testify that getting hit by her original Star Power already often meant you were dead meat. 2 seconds is a VERY long time in a game like this.
---
Still, good ideas should be upvoted, so here you go.

My second account have leon at 2k
---
Jessie kills me
---
Nice, but I seen it before on an earlier post
---
nOt tHE fACe!
---
&gt;Anyways, here it is again.
---
&gt;Basically it's a simple concept. The less of a super you use, the less super meter is used. If a colt uses super and only manages to fire off 10 of 12 bullets before dying or being interrupted, that colt would respawn with a sixth of his meter. 
---
It's simple, but not as much as our current system.
---
&gt;Now this wouldn't work with everyone. The only brawlers who could take advantage of this are colt, Rico, barley, brock, bull, rosa, and possibly carl. But to those brawlers it would make logical sense.
---
Note: this does not mean you can cancel your super voluntarily whenever you want. It simply reimburses brawlers who died before the full effect of their super was used. This would not only make these brawlers more reliable, but also nerf the very powerful knockback mechanic control featured in many attacks.
---
The use of knockback is a weapon used to counter these supers. You note that there are many knockback elements but only Shelley's , El Primo's, Bull's, and Darryll''s super along with Bibi's knockback have this and a few others I probably missed. It's mostly super's and not attacks. I feel like having knockback resetting super allows for the tactic of timing to be used strategically. It allows for brawlers to win unlikely matchups like against a charged Shelley or Frank as it resets their Super so they can't use it instantly to counter you. It rewards timing, which I think is an important element in the game. 
---
&gt;P.s. Frank super and Snare-a-bear mines would cancel the rest of the super as they are stuns and quite naturally are designed to interrupt opponent brawlers.
---
I guess this makes sense but I don't know how we should categorize what can interrupt and what can't.
---
This isn‚Äôt stealing it‚Äôs just the same idea
---
Not bad
---
That bibi deserve getting the game blown up on her face
---
nah, if you ask me it would be better if he sounded like some alien squid demon, like imagine him saying "gqurnnrurhggflfhjehsndund" and "blunendhennejvkvkejdndmlurgle"
---
Even they couldn't bring themselves to say that Supercats is better.  
---
I sure do feel that difference though.
---
Somebody once told me
---
It was just me
---
That is awesome
---
Stuff )'_'(
---
too op
---
What's sad is after it said there's a never version of the game
---
Nice, not a repost though
---
I captured the picture before that popped up actually
---
Tough luck. At least you stalled out a little
---
At least he did not walk it in goal
---
56K health!?
---
I think I‚Äôll just keep playing until I find it boring, I‚Äôm still addicted to this game even though I haven‚Äôt gotten a legendary yet
---
I don't think he is. Mortis is so bad against most brawlers so he has to spin no matter what. That's why primos and shellys use mortis to charge their supers because he can't do anything against them. Even with energy drink, a shelly super will still kill him
---
Congrats man
---
Wait... That's illegal
---
Sorry
---
&gt;I was categorizing it as true stun and knockback-induced stun.
---
I haven't seen the effects of the Snare a bear trap but I'd assume it'll work like you said.
---
&gt;And not that I'm bad at the game (I have 88?? Toiphies (no mythic, only Leon) I simply feel like those Supers that have knockback aren't being used for their true purpose. Sort of like they are being wasted when you use a Shelly Super to stop their Brock. I can understand this though. I just dont feel like moving backwards 2 inches should make you lose the rest of your super. And, of course, you would still stop firing Super when you get knocked back. It just helps you out with getting ready for another one.
---
It would help you get another one out, but I'd think it'd make one time Supers like Shelly be able to recharge it instantly (unless it goes back up but more slowly) and kinda make it reusable. It'd work better for other brawlers like Colt or Brock where it isn't fully reusable instantly.
---
&gt;I can just imagine, visually, the Super bar actually going down when using those Supers instead of instantly depleted when you are still "Supering". Its just, how I see it, a knockback is a tiny interruption (like stuns, but smaller) that simply isn't long enough to call it a stun. You get knocked back and move on. 
---
I would say both knockbacks and stuns interrupt you, with knockbacks making you move back while stuns keep you in place. Either one can be modified on whether they deplete the enemy super or not depending on balancing.
---
&gt;Yes, being in the right place at the right time is the biggest part about playing Brawl Stars better. I can be cool with reactionary Super cancelling. I pushed to 8.8K with it this way. It does provide some counterplay against those brawlers. (I feel like that is a big reason these Brawlers aren't as good as they can be) I am totally fine if SC keeps it this way.
---
I'd be fine if it was the other way arround, as long as it makes the game more balanced and fair. Whether knockback depletes or not, I just want whatever helps the game.
---
&gt;P.S. thank you so much for replying and treating me as a human being, not as some dumb, moronic creature that plays Brawl Stars. That is a big relief. Some discussion goes a long way here.
---
Thanks to you aswell for having this discussion. This has been quite pleasant compared to my typical encounters.

U get +4 for 3rd? Damn.

I mean to say that it is definitely probably in fact it's likely, but to call them a bully and a cheater based on an assumption is assuming too much.
---
Create a supercell ID, hook ur account up to that, then log out.

---
No matter which map it is there will be a tank  or shelly chasing my mortis around if i am lucky other people died quickly then i gain trophies otherwise same results i will run into some other brawlers while running away 90% time this happens this is the reason my mortis isn't 600 yet

Estoy a 8200 copas con 21 brawler
---
Ni uno De ellos es legendario I aun asi no me quejo I sigo jugando so no juegan es porque no les gusta I esto no va De copas va De arte.
---
Yup
---
Depends on the map. I usually use Robo retreat not to run away but to help me juke shots or more realistically move out of range of incoming fire so I can last a little longer and maintain the pressure. If the opposition is weaker than me skill wise I may even risk taking some hits to activate it earlier so I can be even more aggressive in applying pressure. On very rare occasions on gem grab it may come in handy as a Hail Mary for stealing the gems and running away. But for maps where there really isn‚Äôt room to move around then just go with Super bouncy because you are far more devastating in connecting hits. Just my perspective
---

Not gonna lie, I do this sometimes. If I'm really pissed off and someone ticks me off (like taking my powercube), I will make it my damn mission to make sure they die. I would rather they come 10th and I come 9th than come first in the game. Nothing feels better than killing someone who pisses you off. I would then spin for like 30 seconds straight after.

I need to do the interior of spikes a bit more. Done his room as i was loving in it

Well my opinion is this, when I get matched up with players that have 2-7k trophies when I‚Äôm sitting at 13000 I obviously have much more experience with the game and the other brawlers I play against, having that said one trick ponies are mostly bad at the game because if you only play one brawler specifically Shelly and go into any map or mode without knowing the game you‚Äôre gonna get clapped once you reach a certain point around 600 trophies
---
**"Make her tits bigger"**
---
I cant tell if this is a joke and im about to get wooshed or whatever (like I care) but Brawl was first released in beta in early June of 2017, and certainly before the stupid super cats game which I cannot believe is getting attention again after like 1.5 years of forgetting about it.
---
You right, 1 for coins and pp, another 2 for sp. Me bad)

I got 5 kills last round,unfortunately one of them was the hostage

You rookie.

Haha funny drawing!

If you think ƒ± should drop, ƒ± will.

:(
---
Killing a mortis as tick without super is even better
---
I will bring you the gift of darkness
---
When you see a shelly using shell shock instead of band aid...
---
Also you can have Leon with Mortises star power, Rico with magnum special(11,9 tile range), Primo with  band aid, Leon with robo retreat, Colt with rocket no. 4, and the Piper's star power. The other ones I haven't tested yet.
---
*Say sike right now*

Okay now that is epic. What are the *total trophy* ranges of people u fought around 400-500?

Nah

Well in different languages it‚Äôs ADA

NOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!! DONT JOIN THE DARK SIDE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I thought it was too good to be true.

[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/chq2il/how_could_i_pass_up_the_opportunity_to_make_a/) is my rather BIZARRE entry for this challenge.

\#2J2202YL2
---
Frame 0072
---
0.0366% I got spike and crow at less than 2k trophies, and now I'm about to be at 7k with no hope of ever getting leon :(
---
*edgeworth has entered the fray*
---
Idk :0
---
Do you have his new star power?
---
Not with the new system. If I seriously played, I could get all my brawlers to 400,500 plus on a new account fairly quickly.
---
Rockabilly... I guess?
---
Yeah back when pre global players had like 20-21 brawlers and 500 was an grind and not "every players will get 500 per brawler eventually".  
---
Realistically the new "10k" people were talking about is probably more like 700 per brawlers. So about 19k trophies.
---
Which app did u used
---
This is so true for us mortis nibbas
---
I deleted it it was so bad
---
put a hashtag before you type
---
I wanna give you award
---
How long did it take you to unlock crow?
---
There were still GOOD players at 12k with most brawlers level 7/8 and they desperately needed gold... this means nothing bro.
---
(*GOD OF WAR SPOILER ALERT*) 
---
Shouldnt they be the opposite? Bull as Poseidon and shelly as Kratos since Kratos won

Sorry to jump on the ‚Äúlook at mah funny number‚Äù bandwagon!

Tbh, that is true, I wish I could travel back in time and upload Brawl Stars as my own game, xD

Usually ranks 6-7 and sometimes 10

Oh wow I guess matchmaking is influenced by the total amt of trophies players have a lot more than I expected. Thanks!
---
Also got power 4 dyna to 500 with randoms...

Love it!

Thanks!

Who called?
---
Is not made by me :3
---
1st of all I have saved the team I am playing with thousands of times and having primos diyng from pocos isn't normal
---
2nd Every match I will get sb who is afk or just doesn't help at all and stays upfront all the time
---
3rd when people score own goals to be cocky and you trying your best as a TARA to defend instead of the shelly and primos of your team doesn't make sence
---
(Sorry if I sound cocky and stuff but most of the games I am boosting my team up)
---
That looks great. Jessie is my favorite and most used brawler in the game. Just did a grind to get her her up to 600 trophies before season ends. Now I‚Äôm exhausted. Had to uninstall the app for a day after that one. Then I did poco... at least now I‚Äôm onto Bull and Rosa, the two most powerful brawlers in the game.
---
No young one.Its the dreaded duo sd teaming.
---
Sad to see this die in new
---
What about star powers? I‚Äôm getting pretty close to to maxing every brawler but there is gonna be 40 star powers I need to buy. That 80,000 gold. That‚Äôs means after getting every brawler lvl9 I‚Äôll be have way threw the gold grind
---
Here's a vid on how to do it https://youtu.be/a8Qji0ZX3Ns
---
colt's backstory in beta says he is a sheriff and a model in brawl town
---
Nice star powers, but i think Spike's star power is useless.
---
Damn I miss Island Invasion
---
So true
---
Nice meme
---
Sorry, not this time
---
This is a live match unfortunately.But i have seen the vid.....are you a Nita main...just curious.
---
actually, no
---
Not all blets are idiots
---
does this really happen? everytime I've gotten a star power, it's literally the only thing I get out of a box. It's the first thing, and the only thing to come out of the box.
---
I have been playing her more often, is it the flair? I'm too lazy to change it.
---
Np
---
All the people with too much gold will most likely be losing it quickly. 54k to buy all the new star powers and thats only if u were fully maxed before hand
---
No god
---
Perhaps
---
i have recently a lot
---
i have the same when i was doing robo rumble glitch with el primo but after 13m 14 sec i can open BS normally
---
This does put a smile on my already happy spike face

It is nice that you already got two legendaries before mythics, it is harder  to get legendaries if you get mythics first

I had 10k when the inflation started and now I have 12k.  from what I gather 12-13k is the new 10k

Ur leaving stoned af

Nice one mate! Just watched your video, good stuff. Love this map.

Primo; COLT LOCKWOOD!

Lol jk, I just used a shading technique

That‚Äôs a big exaggeration

The icon looks like that one brick from mario

I think 12k is more accurate, its mostly people at 12k you see now. It'll probably change eventually

He doesnt have alot of health thats why most people think they can get an easy kill and then they get clapped
---
Aha!! I see u polish :)
---
but what if they trap you behind a wall?
---
its also giving an unfair advantage to him
---
Its all about how much time you have now after 500 trophies
---
I used to be top 30 In my country with all brawlers at 500 and some a little above that
---
Now because i simple dont have enough time to play i i Can only manage top 70
---
"T"
---
Im so pissed that YOUR meme made meme review 18 but whatever
---
Piper js actually good in some brawl ball maps
---
Bruh, bruh
---
She looks way too masculine
---
Praise the church of water sheep
---
She looks way to masculine, but it looks sick
---
Very nice. Literally how I play bull
---
I mean.. she‚Äôs a tomboy, but thanks!
---
Nice! It was an accurate meme.
---
Piper is useable on maybe one map. And even when shes useable theres always a better option. If you want long range and high damage go for brock colt or rico. She has a poor ability to stop goals and her low hp combined with poor damage in close quarters situations, which is most of brawlball makes her much less viable.
---
Where's white crow and crow
---
From me they're GX, i suffer because they're the same
---
I kind of love this idea, but I also think it may increase camping somewhat since kill-stealing would now be much more beneficial.
---
It'd definitely help with teaming though.
---
Man it wasn‚Äôt my purpose to come across as a ‚Äúskilled-player‚Äù, just wanna show this video in which two teamers get killed, really I don‚Äôt care in which way that happens, teaming must stop.
---
That wasn‚Äôt half bad honestly
---
Yes, please!

So basically civil war melee edition
