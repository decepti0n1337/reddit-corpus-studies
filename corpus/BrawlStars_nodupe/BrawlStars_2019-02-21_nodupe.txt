Did you guys try contacting the YouTuber?

Ok, one sentence about pam isnt exactly a story, and after about rank 12 showdown isnt too viable for trophies, meaning I should do 3v3's. Those pretty much depend mostly on the skill of randoms, or if my friends are on. Its not easy going most of the time with 3v3's.

F
---
I know right
---
Smh Darryl and Rico I'd the real üòòüòòüòòüë®‚Äç‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüíã‚Äçüë®
---
What about it though?
---
r/mortisgang do something 
---
I was joking too i don't main nita
---
I beg to differ 
---
In just the last update they changed it. He was previously ricochet for almost 2 years
---
And the arm are so strange
---
This is hi-key gorgeous
---
I think they should add a new trophy road brawler at 4000
---
Im dealing with a person who stole this from you.
---
Maybe it a team and not a random matchmaking team
---
Nita is 7 yet is 50% stronger than a grown man (Colt) measured by hp.
---

---
Be afraid
---
Actually quite different, culture evolved a lot in 10 years
---
GunBound Stars
---
Similar story. I got Mortis last Saturday and then Gene two days later in the 6k Mega Box
---
I think Robin Hood skin has more chance because it's more iconic but they're look like the same
---
PLEASE LIKE to get this idea seen! 
---
In some parts yes but not around the south, and west
---
No we don‚Äôt backstab anyone.
---
Now come over here so I can...uh..project you!

#NO ONE BLOCK GAPS ALLOWED 
---
Darryl would dominate this map
---
Thanks for this bro. I recently got my Leon to 300. I‚Äôll use these tips and later get him to 400 and maybe even 500 in the future. 
---
This should also be the case in Apex legends. For what it‚Äôs worth.
---
Imagine... needing to WAIT for the shot to explode and do damage after attacking. Brought to you by r/mortisgang
---
One of the top in the Meta
---
The first half of every match I just try to charge my super and avoid conflict lol
---
Yea, She does a little too much damage with her super up close. But she is said to be "tank killer" for a reason.
---
They calculate all that crap to award the star player
---
r/leongang
---
I mean in terms of clothing
---
Around the 1900 it would've been more suggesting
---
(why are we discussing the history behind a plausible prostitute in a game anyways) 
---
You won't get past 50 trophies as Piper if you try to play her like bull (point blank autoaim)
---
Especially when they auto aim their super
---
thats not a pro tip, thats a how not to be a noob tip.
---
Favorite thing to do against a Piper as Darryl is wait until they pop the box, then use my super to roll over it to pick it up and run away. Then I follow the Piper in secret and steal the next cube they open the same way
---
Look how they massacred my boy
---
What is it you‚Äôre complaining about exactly?
---
Ok yes but didn't evolve as much because some would still wear the same clothes from 1890 in the early 1900's

Jaja, the name don't is official

It would be a crime to not play Piper exclusively on that account
---
No three pads with star power.

learn spell ahaha

Yes I know

And from documentation prostitutes would be less clothed in the 1900 than in the 1890
---
Brawl stars is way more balanced than clash is

His quality is like the graphics of gta san andreas. He does not even have a string on his bow.

Thats like a rich boy skin
---
I think that if you are playing Brawl Ball, if you get the most goals (Aka 2 in 2 point game, or if it ends with 1 point) you should get star player, then if needed, then factor kills and stuff
---
So that means the punches will have "ora" sound effects. His idle sounds is him licking his cherry, and his super stops time by saying "za warudo", then flying and slamming a road roller on the target zone.
---
We should totally make supercell make this the lore of piper
---
Pretty good overall, but the proportions on the face seem a little odd.
---
To get elected .
---
Only one player in the game has to be 400 or greater for you to be able to view it
---
You say that but I can‚Äôt count the amount of times I‚Äôve been picked off by a Shelly at long range. 
---
Wow, that map is great. Matches Leon perfectly!
---
THIS GAME AND A VERY BAD CONNECTING GARBAGE DOES NOT SERVE EITHER TO WALK THAT SHIT AND BAD BAD DOES NOT PROVIDE FOR NOTHING WITHOUT TALKING ON THE TIMINHOS THAT DO ON SHOWDOWN AND THE FOCUS ON THE STRONGER PERSON THAT'S IN THE GAME I'M HURTING GAME EVERY DAY MORE !!

Nice
---
Nope, not yet, but Jacktyle contacted him on Twitter. No replies.

It said that a hog riders sister was denied by every hog in the valley, or something like that and alot of people caught it

I‚Äôm not asking what the all star award is based off of as much as I‚Äôm saying let‚Äôs have some after brawl stats to check out if we wanna know more about player performance breakdown

Pay attention to battle, killfeed, then you'll know why

Last 10 games my team around 4k-6k other team 10k-11k

Still though, I think All Star award should be fixed. It seems to factor only deaths and kills when it should be factoring things specific to a mode, like the example I listed

Learn you‚Äôre grammar.

Where is the bug?

i think maybe it could happen. There was a thing where a gem grab map had 6 barrels in the corner and when tara uses her super on the very corner there is a one block gap. The only thing i wonder is if bots could get through the corners of the rocks

With a little bit more added details, like username, tokens, current trophies and power, this definitely has a chance at making a huge appeal for Supercell to consider! I love the desigdn and all. Hopefully one more upvote will make all of that big of a difference! :)

Is there a point where a meme can‚Äôt be recycled anymore? Like it has to deteriorate eventually right?

I don't mind the healing but I'd prefer if his star power was that when teammates use one of their atracks on Gene they restore 250 health.

He's a genie after all. He should grant wishes

Yeet!

And turns out to be a good map for sharp shooters

I already did, the whole commotion was 3 hours long, i think Demise was going to give Jack a shoutout, but im not 100% sure. But after the situation i got banned in both their discord and BS club because one of the mods didn't like how i was asking for an apology, Demise also blocked me.

Never really cared for any of the top club organization like nova or tribe they just always seem too be way too serious about the game like it‚Äôs real life lol and now this stuff happening kinda makes nova look scummy not everyone there but definitely the people involved

Thanks mate. It's like finding your soul mate. Just keep playing with randos and you might encounter this eventually.

---
After a few days people will begin to memorize the map. Not gonna work.
---
For bounty I think stars gained by kills would be better than kills. Killing a 7 star brawler is more important than killing 3 newly-spawned brawlers IMO.
---
Hahah knew it! I‚Äôm dieGone used to play with you and Dre$420. We ran games back in beta days. 
---
I isn‚Äôt much help, but if your not listening to brawl stars sound effects, go to setting and turn them off, and try avoiding massive bright explosions. Those cause major lags

Meanwhile I opened 100 plus boxes and still cannot get the star power for the only maxed character in my account.

Is it just me or is there no links or attachments here?
---
I used to play with him. But i just started a new account and trying to reach 500trophies with shelly at level 1. You can see where i am at my profile.
---
While we are at it...we need to have Power Level affect the matchmaking as well. I should not be getting teammates at Power Level 1 or 2 vs a team with players at Power Level 5+ each. THAT is more of an unfair advantage than teaming up.
---
Alchymist Dynamike - add more colors on him like he spilt chemicals.
---
Bravo
---
Ikr wtf Supercell change it to spiky spike
---
Surrealism at its finest
---
Lol this is an old screenshot because that is how he looked like before de re-model
---
have seen the show ;)
---
lol, interesting, managed to reach the 500 ?. so for me to get 600 and a few trophies with Crow was a headache, even more so after the 500 that almost everyone has the power of the star, and Crow's, I think it's good, but even then he's going to take a big damage and stay with your critical HP. kk
---
Nah I was wondering cause I tried 'phatnigga' and it wasn't allowed

I forgot this map existed. How is it called?
---
Go away weeb
---
instead of kills there could be the players best stat, either assists, longest time holding gems etc
---
Maybe they can make it like in Apex legends where you choose what stats you want to show at the end of the game for example: distance walked, kills, kills with super, goals scored, damage done to safe ect.
---
I team when I feel pity for someone who has a low amount of power points and basically stands no chance in any fight, is it necessarily wrong?

Cool

I'm sorry, but are you really that stupid?

I think at this point supercell should rework his Star Power completly. Maybe his Super could grant some Vision around them or something like that.

No sh!t shurlock. I do like the art, but it isn‚Äôt that funny to me.

Thx you too

Solo showdown: Cavern Churn
---
Gem Grab: Hard Rock Mine
---
This 2 are your best options. He is overall pretty good but if you really want to push him hard it is best to play him in those maps. If you are playing gem grab don't play with randoms because no matter how good you are in it you can always trust that the randoms will screw you life up. 
---
Frank is actually pretty bad right now, he doesn't need a nerf.
---
His super takes a while before he actually hits, so you have a bit of time to dodge it. It's especially easy with characters that have increased movement speed, such as tanks, Crow, Leon, Mortis and star power Colt.
---
You can cancel his super with stuff like: Shelly's super, Primo's jump, Bull's charge, Darryl's roll, Gene's pull, Tara's pull ,Dynamike's bomb, Piper's grenades and Bo's  mines. Don't think I missed any
---

I don't play Shelly :D

Thanks man. 400 is insane. I don't think I got the patience to get that far 
---
That's still pretty sick man 
---
I never said that...I said I‚Äôm pretty sure brawler trophies are taken into account, and the longer you wait while matchmaking, it starts looking for higher and lower trophy people

Your remodels are so great, congrats!

Woomy!^woomaimee

If you have poisen on 2 enemies you charge your super twice as fast. But 2√ó poisen on 1 enemy, doesnt make a difference

I like the idea besides the overtime part. I think a overwatch style payload would be better in this instance. The point of the game mode would be to push the payload to the destination before time runs out. May be if you are in proximity to the payload time wouldnt run out until the enemy team would be able to push them off of the payload. Let me know what you think :)

---
That would be awesome. Poison stack would make his attack hit hard. He wouldn‚Äôt even need a base damage buff. Some more health would be nice too.
---
Lmao how high in trophies are you man?

Another amazing remodel. Keep up the great work man. Supercell should hire you!

Am I the only one thinking that this is worse than it is right now in the game? 
---
There's no space for anyone to rotate around or do anything as the poison cloud closes. This is already a problem for Thousand Lakes due to low land-to-water ratio. The end game for this map seems even worse. But cool idea anyways!

I have never played a real match on this map

Supercell can stop teaming. But they don‚Äôt want to
---
Nvm, I still like it very much :)
---
Such a great concept! 
---
I forgot to say, Mortis sucks. But good artwork! 
---
If on the app, go to the r/brawlstars subreddit home screen, then click the three dots in the corner. Once there, select ‚Äòchange user flair‚Äô, then it will open a menu where you can choose any brawler.

She's sugar and spice üòä

How the fuq did you find this post lmao
---
Dyna-Jump is best
---
I‚Äôd say two 0s. Otherwise most skins would be cheaper than buying a Star Power from the shop (except for Phoenix Crow). 
---
Oh thanks for the tip!!

W A T E R 
---
Why? You doesn't like that, because you can't farm tokens? 
---
I don't see a problem here. You are the only one who complain about this lol. The game is developed and designed as it is. 
---
This is the biggest problem with Brawl Stars right now and needs to be addressed immediately.  I can't believe this hasn't been dealt with sooner.
---
Take my upvote!

I agree.  I almost always play showdown except to get star tokens.

*get teamed*
---
U shouldn‚Äôt cuz ur not confident and u look like someone that might suck
---
You need to put another zero
---
It is even more necessary since there would be less solo queued players.  The matchmaking time would be not much more for full teams.

It's made to be a late game content where you have no use for gold, not a "uh I'll save my 1200 coins to get this skin instead of leveling my brawler". Skins are one of the ways Supercell makes money through the game, if you give a f2p alternative to gems you have to make players really work for it, not just open some boxes and boom, 150 gems skin.

Leon need a buff üòÄ

This is really in tune with the official artwork,  please take my upvote!

So the people that spawn in the middle are just F'ed?
---
Great model..but i think Tara looks fine now..if it's anyone who needs a remodel it'd BO!(COMEON SUPERCELL!!!)...Dope model though..
---
you can buy a skin with 30 gems, and i would go for cosmetics over progression. plus theres 5 different power point offer per day. if you really wanted to buy power points for a certain brawler you can just wait it out and buy it with COINS
---
Forgot about echo chamber too...

If im not wrong, you get the replay because someone else in the game has 400 trophies
---
Still give credit to wherever you got it from, if I put my name over "How the Grinch Stole Christmas" yeah it would be ridiculous to convince someone that you wrote it, but you give credit just to say "This isn't my idea, but I think I'll share it with this sub cuz I think it belongs here." I'm just saying in the future try to give credit if you yourself did not make the content. That's all.

Ahhh whoops, there's another thing I forgot to mention. I didn't want to use any of the 3v3 maps considering they're pretty small, so the games wouldn't last as long. It's still going to be 5v1 (someone else mentioned 2v4) though, but just on a larger map.

I don‚Äôt think so, if you already have the coins to level up a brawler and you just need power points, I‚Äôll personally do it. Because I prefer going progression over skins, honestly it‚Äôs just up to you. Maybe using the gems for token doublers would be even better

What if poison damage stacks? Not tickin more times, just so the damage got stacked accordingly to how many times you hit a knife
---
No this succ
---
Alright,my bad...
---
Why not? They have replays, or they can institute a tribunal system like League of Legends where the players can watch the replay and see if the report is legit. Better than letting people who are purposefully trying to ruin the game from going unpunished

Looks like a fun map for Darrel

Not sure if I will post all of the games to my YouTube, but I should be posting at least the Finals

When I say low trophy I mean I just got to 450 trophies and his low health means he can't survive 2 hits from a colt nvm a bull etc

Good idea, but we just got rid of petitions... To be fair, yours is much higher quality, but please don't bring back petition spam. It was aweful.

Its stayed at .1056 forever no matter how many boxes I open, and I havent got a new brawler since Rico
---
I make
---
Disagree with that one
---
That's better than o orginal 
---
Pretty cool overall but is this for a winning team only? And, in general, what about the other team?
---
Also, while cosmetic improvements like this are great, I don't see many substance posts on this forum that are focusing on important game mechanics.
---
A biggie sort of related to this screen: when a team loses, I feel like there's a tendency for a player to blame everyone else. For that reason, it's important to know who was the star player on the losing team. Otherwise, if you lost but thought you were the star of the team (lost because of the others)...but someone else got star player, that's a helpful reality check?
---
And even more than that, the, star player should  always get the +10 xp star player bonus even if on a losing team. This is because a losing team currently has no incentive at all to keep trying if they feel like there's no chance at all. 
---
I remember going against it once long ago...

if they can find a way to make money off of it and lots then yes they will and hope to see it come to some of the cheaper consoles too or pc for pc all they hve to do is youse left click hold for movement right click hold for attack and maybe click and hold the scroller for super and as alternative hold S and use mouse to aim or tap any button once for auto aim hows my controls

Supercell: *Adds this in*

Shelly: *5/200 Power Points*

Colt: *12/50 Power Points*

Bull: *209/500 Power Points*

Brawl Box: *Gives you Colt &amp; Shelly Power Points*

Colt: *202/75 Power Points*

The only one that I'd be okay without remodel is with Crow. The other models got many errors with their current model.

The og joke is Bison. But at this point Bull's life support would be bush juice.

This is one of the actual bad matchmaking posts not just because people have max brawlers

I do know how to counter mortis, i'm at 10k trophies lmao. It's still not enough, and while trying to counter mortis, it usually leads you getting killed while you're trying to back off from him.

Honestly I've only reposted once and I've credited  the original poster
---
This obviously makes sense at higher levels of play but early on it's really not necessary.  It would just increase queue times for teams substantially, and people who play with their friends who aren't necessarily that good would just lose every team match (and end up disliking the game).
---
Shelly has to tap the super button so she can use her super
---
Brawl ball gay asf now even if it got rid of that annoying mortis fuck
---
We can talk about the fallbacks of the game without cursing out people bro.
---
If you have a good point to make, people won't want to listen to you because of your attitude. Perhaps offering up a suggestion to the game mode or a game mode to replace showdown. 
---
But many people enjoy playing showdown. My problem with it is teaming. (But i know thats part of the game and can't get rid of it)
---
Good luck.
---
Really cool!
---
Ok this is actually funny lol

Srry dude shes bad

Yeah so basically darryl haven for quick escapes lol

That's what the britons want you to think.

Unless gene himself is poisoned. He doesn‚Äôt self heal.

I choosed water for a better contrast. Too bad there aren't unbreakable walls.

Yikes
---
1. How many trophies are you even at
---
2. Where is your actual evidence aside from RNG, which every game involves.
---
3. Showdown is actually a pretty fun mode, even for being a battle royale type. It is at least better than Gem Grab, and is good for small trophy pushing
---
Same

They sure are! I fell for them thanks to u/CoachFlapjack and all the fanart I‚Äôve seen here.

Good luck! I hope you get one! I'm glad not receiving a legendary didn't lead to you to not want to play the game anymore. Brawl On!
---
Won't work.. Tara's super is a 3*3 tiles
---
I would like as a passive ability that all healing is negated while poisoned. Maybe baking it into his star power.
---
Most likely remove a Zero
---
50k is too much
---
Classic El Primo, always elbow dropping himself in the worst situation
---
Quit being toxic m8
---
Too much boxes, I think
---
Create a room
---
Tell him the room code
---
He joins the room
---
Tap on him and send friend request dude wtf
---
Its my main game mode too. 
---
Now we‚Äôre segregating him out of that too?
---
Damn dude grats.  Mortis by far my worst character, stuck around 300 cups right now.  Everyone else easily up to 400 and putting in more work, but I suck sooo bad with Mortis. 
---
SHE?!? He has a beard lol. Gene‚Äôa a guy
---
Spike is a character for whom u can make any skin but he will be great...
---
What do Leon‚Äôs hands look like? We never see them...
---
Ikr
---
in the next update there will be some Brawler Remodels,
---
A new Game Mode 
---
new skins and new bralwer.

anf ofc balance changes

Yeah man but a skin tooüòÖ

hahaha

He could have six fingers for all we know...
---
1vs1 would be amazing. 
---
Lex likes his bushes
---
Niceee!
---
Shit
---
tight now hes good alomost everywhere. 
---
Just dont always run into the face of other brawlers and use your shots wisely ( dont auto aim btw)
---
He is really hard to play, as a new player i would not recomend him, learn first the game over all and the interactions fo the characters, and try him when you get better.
---
The thing is: if you play mortis you play like a whole new game, you cant compare his playstile with anyone
---
Cool concept. I like it. Good job. 
---
Star power
---
awk no why ? 
---
He would have 11 in total bOi
---
Spike is a pokemon btw....
---
[Idea] if you are poisoned your teammates cannot heal you untill it goes away. Inculdes poco's heal pam's turret and gene's star power.
---
always upvote riochann art
---
OOFFF
---
Thanks 
---
Hot, hot, hot

the games are to short, and SC is family firendly, no voice chat, so nobody can curse on each other.

Many people who only have a phone call each other via Discord, and then start the game and play !
---
BRUH
---
üçÑ: Your welcome.. and yeah, happy üç∞ day 
---
It can be quite helpful for a squishy brawler who was forced to pick up gems. With this feature, they can drop the gems and let their gem carrier pick up the gems. 
---
Idk‚Äî
---
Haha thanks ! üôè
---
Still should have just been patient.
---
Wait....again, not a Primo trait.
---
Maybe not against bull, but Shelly's super juggle is extremely OP in the right circumstances. Like I can solo a 10+ powercube Poco easily just by doing super + attack over and over
---
That‚Äôs a smart idea
---
DAGA KOTOWARU
---
on*
---
first: this is not LoL , no champion, its Brawler.
---
Second: JEssie is the most skillbased brawler in the game. play her at around 400-500 and then i want to see how you will perform without hours of practize
---
Hey, had to teach these teamers a lessonü§´
---
Yes I have way too many coins and nothing to do with them
---
Nuuu, Jessie is more like 17
---
Piper‚Äôs shots deal more damage the farther away she is. She‚Äôs standing right next to the crate so it‚Äôs going to take like 6-7 shots to open it compared to 3-4 at longer range
---
One frank bikini skin coming up
---
Maybe not a remodel but a skin? Still looks really good, and I like how she isn't just bandages
---
Yes really but with more colors this will be better i think 
---
Exactly, everyone thinks solo showdown is the only gamemode. I've reached 13k mostly playing heist.
---
Same with leon
---
Those darn randoms... They get ya every time!
---
Correction, the when to team section should be empty, don't be a teaming jerk.
---
Like Poco's star power. I think that Gene's star power should be that when you fail your super you receive half of it.
---
Yeah, throwers are starting to quit teaming and mortises are taking their place.
---
It kind of does already.
---
üòÇthat‚Äôs a lot of gems 
---
Nah it's bullets
---
Stick a fork on me
---
SO NO CHI NO SADAME
---
I actually made it on paint.net &gt;_&gt; the meme is OC, the joke is pretty old tho i must admit, however i don't care if it gets reposted, i'm actually kinda proud that someone reposted my OC
---
It works !
---
I think excel is too simple and lame but everyone has their own opinion 
---
What's wrong with wanting to have skins? What else can have when all your brawlers are maxed out?
---
I know and it‚Äôs awesome! 
---
Smh my head, so true max darryl would have made life so much easier
---
Dont know who *you're* thinking about, but shelly's in charge far as *I* know
---
The bushes in stormy plains are not connected, that's why death valley won for sd
---
50k is so high
---
Not anymore, people don't backstab. Also, quit being so selfish and look at it from the perspective of the non-teamers. They play solo showdown to play a SOLO game and they end up trying to take on nine people on their own. Even if someone gets backstabbed here and there, they are still meant to fight a giant army alone.
---
True it is simple but it's a great map for Brock, Piper, Penny and sometimes Dynamike.
---
Sure üòä
---
At least there won't be dynamikes teaming
---
Give me a pair

Imagine Shaggy using 100% of his power to shoot a bull with Shelly's super...

Yeah, today was my worst day ever, lost 110 trophies. Bounty is the biggest problem, people just attack if we're leading. Gonna take a brake for a few days, don't want to start hating the game.

Will do, but I can‚Äôt play now
---
oh yeah I think I remember ur post about your gf casually getting spike, it still hurts me inside
---
It‚Äôs not RNG? It‚Äôs a set pattern
---
indeed
---
Correct.
---
It's sad that in an assassin meta, crow, the toxic assassin, does so poorly. #buffcrow
---
*crash*
---
I dont get it
---
those aren't shoes...
---
Tbh i see That as a new brawler 
---
Like the effort so I'm liking this post but I personally don't like the design
---
Creature of the morning? XD
---
At this point everyone teams like I can guarantee everyone did it at some point. Its very influential. 
---
That was incredible placement 
---
its okay, youre welcome. Im just another
---
Yeah I love playing Mortis and i am also in the r/mortisgang and nobody would do that. It was also around when I was in rank 10 so maybe that was why but with the new matchmaking that shouldn‚Äôt be the reason
---
Never would this be added into the game
---
Yeah I tried throwing it behind me so he would be stuck in the storm longer and it worked perfectly 
---
The kill stat would only be for bounty and in heist it would show damage contributed
---
Woah this idea is amazing! It actually looks pretty epic but my only complaint is it's too much? I don't know how to explain it except in my opinion I feel like there's too much going on. I prefer a simplistic end screen more but this looks pretty dope. 
---
I explain my reasoning for the design in another comment.  I do appreciate your opinion though. What don't you like about it specifically?
---
And this is why you have 4K trophies 
---
I believe February is the final month..
---
Of course, but they also need to consider things like doubler and tickets, because generally you can only get them with gems (I know boxes contain that but you need to be lucky)
---
That could be in like another screen where you click a button to see the complete stats for the game, like heal stats, dmg stats, distance travelled, deaths , kills, all that stuff. 
---
Are you subbed is all i need to know
---
How long have you been playing? I don‚Äôt think trophies matter as much as play time for these things. If you were crazy and pushed to 6.5k in a week then obviously you wouldn‚Äôt have any rare brawlers.
---
Or darryl. That way he can just camp and then get super and charge in (and then the team can also go in)
---
I don‚Äôt speak retardation
---
Is that a cookie? 
---
She‚Äôs ok at mid-range, but overpowered at short range. She gets her ult in 2-3 attacks at short range, and her ult oneshots most of the brawlers 
---
and I am a creature of the night
---
Well get used to it. I know guys at 11K without legendaries. 
---
Even worse when rico's super is loaded
---
Tbh I don‚Äôt really know anyone above 10k that doesn‚Äôt team. (Other than youtubers)
---
Piper at a certain level can snipe the stealers and kill them in seconds
---
I got in one game that was all Bo's (including me)
---
have much fear mortis is here
---
üòÇ
---
I‚Äôm at 6.5k and only ten to backstab.
---
WOW WHAT THE F##K IS THIS. THIS IS AMAZING PLS SUPERCELL PUT THIS PLS SUPERCELL PLS SUPERCELL PLS SUPERCELL PLS PLS PLS PLS

---
Juicy
---
hey now you're a brawl star 
---
I guess, but more options are always better as you can simply just not use an options if you don't want to 
---
And darryl
---
Yea guys I can get the legendary pokemon mortis

---
Thanks !! üòä
---
If you are near a corner, you can run to clip it even if they throw it well. At least the option exists
---
Omg I just realized it isn‚Äôt that. Omg her eye is a sticker

Number 5 has alot of trophies in total woah

He could do that but you need to ask this Spike not meüòú

Supercell NEVER said they support it. They just couldn‚Äôt stop it so they adapted. They actually added event mods in an effort to minimize teaming. It ruins the experience and if people who didn‚Äôt like teaming just didn‚Äôt then you‚Äôd be helping other people have a little more fun.  
---
Me too
---
looks like it's going to murder all the modes in showdown, i like it

Neither is calling u an idiot for defending them. ;-)

yep pretty easy but Spike is also one of the most beloved ones and he definitely needs more skins, thats why you see many spike skins popping out everywhere.
---
Amazing idea, just one thing, make the cards face towards us. (I want to know how they actually look.
---
Nobody asked me but i havent gotten a new brawler in 20 days(exactly 20 days) (i dont have penny, any epics, any mythics, any legendarys) 
---
why does your coloring looks so good, FML
---
Darryl would be so op on this map
---
You are legally required to gang up on the Power Cubed 5+ Bull

Its so annoying when you try to escape and get stuck in a wall :C

Gems? 
---
Me three! This is so awesome! 
---
Well i guess shoot him until he dies a second time? IDK Burn him or tell him a creepy story and scare him off... 
---
Thank you! :D
---
M8 people are 10k without legends and mythics and your at 2k? And are complaining? Lmao
---
Y o I n K s S c O o B

I have mortis üòÇ
---
Dodging might not be an option for literally any attack in the game. And the counterplay is either dodging it if you see it coming or having a close range teammate stand in front of you so if he ults he pulls your close range brawler and is dead.
---
thank you!
---
you are a pro
---
Very nice

even if its gems or coins, I can never buy it lol
---
Hunter uses his powerful crossbow to pick of enemies at a distance. His trap ensnares anyone who strays to close...
---
Hunter's reload speed would be fast, and his movement would be normal. His super would take 5 hits to charge. While he doesn't do a crazy amount of damage, his fast reload would allow him to keep enemies pushed back and his decent amount of health would keep him in fights for as long as possible.
---
This took a lot of work, so any feedback would be appreciated!
---
I guess, but that level of teamwork isn't that common but corner clipping Tara's super or Mortis is common and easy to do SOLO

'You will be matched against the same brawler you play.' 
---
Good for you
---
Seems pretty interesting, the brawlers should also be all max. so everyone could have a duel about straight up skill

Wow I love the teamers, thats like something I would do
---
Pretty nice
---
I think you meant to put [Petition], not [Idea] /s
---
How do you feel when one of your brothers chicken out when killing a Dyna?
---
r/MortisGang
---
Thats actually what his character model looks like tho...
---
Everyone has stubs... even Leon
---
I thought it was only pussgurka, zigzurlu, and trikshot 
---
And you proud of that? Means you got help to reach 12k
---
Yup takes practice you‚Äôll get used to it tho
---
You should just aim, my dude. 
---
awesome
---
by saying that it's completly fine to it and that they wouldn't ban people to do it, it means that this strategy has their support, or either every showdown would be leach life based or it would have some other "defensive" things, like giving extra trophies for kills, or way to temporarly ban, there were many ways to solve it, but they chose not to. even in their old post about it, around an year ago, they also remembered to people that it was a strategy also in hunger games. people may not like it, but it's definetly accepted and a successful strategy, especially if everyone does it, avoiding it would just mean losing trophies
---
Give him the benefit of the doubt... maybe he didn‚Äôt see your post. I didn‚Äôt see it and Leon as a cat is a fairly basic idea.
---
It‚Äôs not broken. His ult sucks and needs to be buffed.
---
It‚Äôs way too slow. It puts you at a disadvantage if you use it.
---
You need to depend on your team to use it effectively 
---
Thank you! üòä‚úåüèº
---
They should make it the same price of gems, but add two 0s at the end.
---
don't tell him, he will scare you even moreüëª

A full list of moderators, their permissions levels, and when they were added can be found [by clicking here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/about/moderators). I was added pretty recently to help with posts.
---
Can this just be real I dont even have him but can it just be real
---
He probably talks out loud as well when playing ‚ÄúJessie use turret! Kill those guys!!‚Äù
---
Please read the description i said im working on a losing team screen to go with it
---
Well yeah, they are the best brawler on the specific maps. 
---
Your kom has the biggest bush
---
same :"(
---
I think it would be better if each time you won, you got 25 tokens, and every time you competed all 23 you would get a big box or something. Also adding a time limit would be pretty cool.
---
His arms are tiny lmao
---
Just wait till u get more trophies there will be other brawlers used
---
Sin dolor, no gloria
