I found one scam on this reddit page.  Yeah you arent the only one.  The only people supporting it are the people posting about it, and they all have the name of "BrawlTV".  Super unconvincing.

Mine is .1006 and I need all the mythics, spike, and crow
---
I like this, but think it‚Äôd look better with the darker hair seen on bandito Shelly, personally.
---
Nah you pretend to not kill that kid hoodie
---
I got crow before Rico seems like luck I only recently got poco crow was my fourth

but if you have youtube rewind 2018 on your team then you can't win

I beg everyone who is reading this comment and hasn't gone there yet. DO NOT GO THERE. I went there, I regret literally everything.

Recently I had Spike at 0.2544% and I completed the collection (25/25 brawlers)

Of course! Look at your gems.

You should name him spikeless spike

I gotten used to them, I get board of symmetrical maps, the something top down left and right, although took some time I love the asymmetrical maps now, and I wish SuperCell would add more in the future.

---
He dosen't need a health buff because he can attack from around walls and he actually has the longest range in the game if he is bouncing his balls.
---
A movement buff is not necessary.
---
He already unloads pretty fast (like 3 balls per second or something)
---
His bounce shot range could use a buff but it has to be minor because before he has an extra 2 tiles per bounce and that was way op so they nerfed it to 1.6 tiles and he was fine.  Buffing it to 1.7 tiles could work.
---
My idea for nerfing his star power and increasing his normal damage would make his damage the same and it would still stay the same. The nerf wouldn't even be a nerf
---
Just wtf!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
Playing since global release and no Gene or Mortis and no legendaries. And I have 5,150 trophies and level 100.

Its really fun but the last robot is the main problem

You disgust me, and literally everyone else. Do you have any idea how sinful teaming is? Do you have any idea of what it‚Äôs like, constantly trying to untilt a brawler,then getting teamed on? Come on man, this is shameful. Sit in the corner and think about what you have done.

No he doesn‚Äôt. He is a stealthy assassin. His Invis is very predictable because it‚Äôs only 7 seconds. That gets you no where. Not to mention it‚Äôs 4 tiles and you can see him. By then any tanks brawler with fast reaction has already killed him.  His Invis is shit without star power. Someone who needs a super rework is Shelly

Huzzah! A man of quality!

then they‚Äôd be similar lol

Joining club would help in gameplay?

Never have I ever intentionally teamed in SD so the one time I do it I hate well sorry

His Invis is a lot harder than you‚Äôd think. You can see him in 4 tiles and it doesn‚Äôt last long enough. Maybe to get you to a bush or an escape.

Didn‚Äôt try. It succeeded.

Welcome Pack is one of the packs that comes back, along with the level packs. The only difference between them is that Welcome Pack will appear to EVERY players at the same time. That means if you get a Welcome Pack offer, everyone does.
---
It came when:
---
- Seasonal event occurs
---
-  New update with a new brawler
---
- Some expensive discounted skins offer (Like when the Phoenix Crow or Nightwitch Mortis offers came, the Welcome Pack also appears)
---
What I don't understand is I didn't get the Welcome Pack offer, but you did. Maybe it's because you are lucky, cause Welcome Pack doesn't come back individually to some players
---
tl;dr
---
It comes back every single time an update occurs, and when it does, other people also have it
---
It‚Äôs still can be used as BM

I got golden Rico back when he was 20 gems üòè

Game is literally unplayable with this horrible character on it. I tried some days ago play Brawlball, and it's ruined. Same for Gem grab, and Showdown. Simply if Rosa is on any game mode, you can't win. So sad.

yeah

He have Spike too.

P.S.: Drew it at school, not sure if the designs of Leon and Spike are correct :/

A little weird. Seems to be your a lurker, and this is your first post. So you'd think, you made an account to advertise, but wait, this account is over a month and a half old! So, how much are they paying you to post this?

Supercell, please, remove Rosa and return the awesome Ricochet instead
---
Ads

Advertisement isn‚Äôt permitted in this subreddit.

Can‚Äôt fix stupid sadly. The question is where in total trophies did poco and Tara fall compared to you?
---
That would make her viable, but not fun. That little bit of invisibility bid what makes her fun. With this change, you‚Äôd be good for a couple seconds and then be like normal

It‚Äôs basically a system of pyramid schemes and advertisement.

Taken from r/50/50
---
You mean teaming tv?
---
Yeah I agree, I use her in solo showdown. She's an absolute monster in gem grab though.
---
Yeah, but it fit so well
---
Well it's a 1% chance, so in theory that means 100 boxes.
---
Personally I got both of mine in the first mega box I opened after getting the brawler to level 9. So it seems like it happens a lot sooner than 100 boxes, but ymmv.

@marcelaylucin made this, you dont have rights to repost this artwork

Thats literally a copypasta copied from comedy cemetery. Its not just us saying shelly is one of the worst brawlers, many high trophy people actually call shelly better than mortis. BuT tHoSe ArE pEoPlE wHo ArE oVeR 10000 tRoPhIeS. Well that is right but their main point is that you should not play with randoms anyway and carrying your team is not the best strategy if you are using a brawler that is over 500 trophies

Because when the bullet hits the wall the speed what that bulled had went to the box and then the wall broke
---
Yeah imagine the rosa waiting at the middle to kill people passing by or the teaming dynamikes. Nita is also a great option for teaming and struggles in SD without teaming because of her low dps
---
Such a wonderful creation! 11/10 will buy

I get that but iT shouldn‚Äôt do that i think

they use it when they are in a fight which is not meant to them its basically for running

Yeah me too, she's unapealing to play completely. Never was excited for her...I wish she gets nerfed 10 times for all i care, i don't want to see another rosa anywhere
---
F
---
Big facts.  
---
When this happens I'm always like... "am I actually invisible?"
---
In the past it took into consideration the average brawler trophies mostly but since the rosa update matchmaking weighs towards the highest total trophies of whichever team member more. I‚Äôm at 11k so that could be why the levels were mismatched.

Why the bots spinning lol
---
What about Shelly? ü§î
---
\*sighs\*  
---
You guys are so basic.  Rosa is designed to deal with the bullying tactics of other melee characters.  There isn't a single ranged character that she is a true challenge for UNLESS they allow her to close distance - which is true for ALLLL melee characters.  
---
For other melee (the biggest complainers), Rosa prevents their bullying.  They CANNOT just charge her because of her range.  HOWEVER... shelly has more range than Rosa... and can chip away at her... while Bull is a two shot up close.  So they are both STILL viable against her.  
---
STOP RUSHING PEOPLE DOWN AND ACTUALLY PLAY THE GAME... and you will easily handle Rosa.  She has been nerfed more than enough.  She isn't even scary anymore.
---
Can someone make a full chain with all the brawlers
---
Wtf, it will be the same but after you attack the bubble won't be there
---
Rosa's not feeling so good...
---
Everybody knows this...
---
It is.
---
Okay, that buildup with Crow had me thinking he somehow killed you
---
Yes
---
This is a meme template I didn't steal your meme lol
---
its a joke? omg! it completely justifies it! haha! any relitives of you died recently?i wanna make a funni meme!

Personaly would hate it
---
r/punpatrol
---
She got nerfed?  That explains a lot .
---
Subtle but effective
---
So untrue, she is just easy to use and simple.
---
The brawler's strength doesn't affect rarity at all.
---
And Supercell are balancing the game every update. I don't believe I'm even replying, dumbest comment I have ever seen in Reddit.
---
Wym Poco is the most annoying, he‚Äôs the only one who can instantly heal after getting him or a teammate down to 1k health or less
---
i dont think theres actually a chance cap for legends
---
I agree I sawed off my ankle bracelet, and moved to Canada. I haven't heard from the police since a year ago.
---
They really didn't think it through.
---
But people still play solo SD as the more competitive choice. How does playing with teams make you a coward and why would anyone be a coward just because they didnt want to lose trophies and outplay the other teamers even more
---
We have seen this thousends of times! Stop posting this bullshit about getting a legendary and global players

See you on the front page

When you think your super did something but dynamike did all the damage.

Ohhh, well check your first comment and you will see why. I wouldn‚Äôt call a teamer a coward if it is going to betray the whole team. You are teaming to stop teaming basically

GREAT IDEA. But honestly, I've seen many mobile games have designs on their buttons but it Eve up looking tacky, messy and overall unclean on a relatively small screen
---
But this is just constructive criticism. GREAT ART
---
Frank 60+ mortis 30-60
---
People themselfs are clueless.... I get STAR PLAYER when loosing often BC I REALLY have a BAD RANDOMS. That just shows luck/skill ratio.
---
Best frank skin by far
---
Cute, but I dont think that would be a good replacement...
---
I love ur Leon it‚Äôs so realistic
---
As a mortis player, that's the most painful experience
---
Poor Mortis
---
I joking  its a very cool skin i like ti
---
nah, almost everytime there's a Bo on the winning team and he plays OK, he get's star player. I've got many brawlers to 500 and that seems to happen all the way. people are extremely stupid, and these bombs do a lot of damage.
---
btw what is the meaning of IQ?  Sorry i just started
---
I see I am dealing with 6 year old.....
---
How is that a disaster? That‚Äôs good for you. Change the title mate
---
i really like the ieda and design , nice job
---
My dude every heard of super stacking if a Shelly and a Bull fight. And Shelly has her super she is just going to super stack till she wins
---
hehe no problem... maybe she also builds a pirate ship :P
---
God, you DO NOT like dark humor...
---
I mean, cool concept. But not new or something, I've seen a lot, in the beta, a little after global. With the same icons, since it's in the game files
---
So ur bi
---
Pretty creative stuff, keep it up!
---
Shut yo ssa backwards up mortis thicc as shit.
---
Oh no I know you weren‚Äôt serious because of the whole capital letters thing, but you said he was balanced, but I think he should be buffed.
---
I know right I've never gotten eight tickets before
---
Why you don't have 1k upvotes this is so amazing
---
Really isnt much of a point when yall the only ones left
---
ok
---
We can
---
 Or I deleted for my purpose not yours so that makes total sense and IF someone is saying something to you and does "your" thing isnt it logical to think "OH he probs have his own purpose, not that i want to say he has"
---
This is so sad , Alexa play despacito
---
Uhhhh
---
/mortisgang will find you
---
Tap ready and choose brawler at the same time. Make sure everyone isnt readied up
---
I would apperciate it if you fixed your grammar.
---
But Omega Flowey is even stronger
---
I play with 4 fingers xD
---
No, then the OGs wouldn't be recognized as much!
---
What language is the translation from?
---
That's kinda, no, it's EXACTLY the point of "limited edition."  There will be more, and you can snag one of them. Then months later, listen to others complain that SC won't offer it again.  And then you can tag this post for them.
---
What
---
Nie wolno sobie z tego ≈ºartowaƒá XD
---
Shouldn‚Äôt it be the other way around since ‚Äúyour minecarts‚Äù are the ones on your side?
---
The subreddit is getting bland
---
i don‚Äôt really mind the buttons in the first place but you did such an amazing job that i have to upvote
---
I‚ÄôM ABOUT TO END THIS WHOLE MAN‚ÄôS CAREER
---
How many trophies do you have on him? The only Gem Grab map I do good in is Escape Velocity and I'm a 460 trophy level 10 Mortis main
---
The joke is everything including your team is trash compared to the other team's
---
What do you mean rosa has a pet plant
---
It isn't at all i once tilted my crow from 410 to 320 that hurts
---
This is Mortis. Mortis slaughters teaming Dynamikes. Mortis flushes the toilet after usage. Be like Mortis.
---
O

Y o u   s e e   S h e l l y   a s   B u l l

It looks like a marijuana dealing crow to me
---
Lmao honestly can't believe how many times this has been done. Still not the worst idea though, it's a shame to not use the old artwork from beta.
---
I love this
---
Great comic lol
---
YES
---
Nice one , bro can u tell me where do I find this tier list template
---
Noice.
---
Not really your fault minecarts suck
---
her stun allows her to fire an extra shot, nothing else
---
Probably because they saw a yt vid on how to get legendarys üòÇ
---
We have enough damn crow skins but I like it
---
Barbarian‚Äôs depressed and on the brink of tears
---
Shelly is fuckin PISSED
---
Blue King is moderately annoyed
---
The Heavy just hit a fat bong rip and has no idea why he‚Äôs here
---
T H R E E
---
r/beetlejuicing
---
And that extra shot charges up her super again
---
AND THE CHICKEN DOESN‚ÄôT EVEN KNOW WHY HE‚ÄôS THERE
---
i don't know, maybe by the fact that i've given you a very in-depth analysis of shelly based on my experience pushing her
---
Uffff ahh
---
How the f*ck did that happen
---
It's Shiba
---
Me: *open a box
---
Enemy Rosa: *Waits 3 kilometers away in a bush
---
Powercube: *dropped 3 kilometers away from me on the Rosa
---
Me: *dies because it's Rosa
---
My phone: *shatteres against my wall
---
Good!
---
Bruh you did that
---
Same I got him 2 days ago
---
He is already a bomber
---
This brings good memories
---
And everytime the post exploded
---
Dude, Spike looks really creep
---
Him or BS?
---
Ok but honestly an extra O doesn‚Äôt shout ‚Äúthis guy is an amateur‚Äù. I‚Äôm sure most people don‚Äôt actually care that much and are focused on the actual art
---
What if they added a secondary attack that charges over time
---
I thought it was the in game model lol, great job!
---
Happy cakeday
---
Thanks!
---
When you're a global player but you don't have any legendaries
---
Honestly tho in solo sd its suicidal to fight another crow as a crow because the winner dies from poison
---
*leon sucks lollipop casually*
---
sure nwn
---
You earned my upvote Sir
---
rico has big pp
---
Also so sorry for your losses. If this is faked, get the hell out.
---
No but it‚Äôs essential sometimes
---
U are in a whole different league
---
This makes me uncomfortable
---
Repost
---
I NEED IT!!! CROW IS MY FAV
---
Usually if any person in the match is above 500, they will be featured on brawl TV. I've been on brawl TV many times actually...
---
Because we used over 100% of the brain.
---
Snank is friends with frank
---
Me with randoms: electro wizard
---
I‚Äôd rather be able to edit where I want my buttons, mainly my super because on my phone I don‚Äôt have room completely to use it. Even my main attack I have some trouble with throwers
---
I don't have Rosa
---
I‚Äôll just continue to save up and go for offers
---
r/brawlstarsp
---
I didn't catch it
---
Its obviously faked look when the account was made
---
( I‚Äôll be normal ) OMG! Nice your a lucky one I wish I got that I only have spike
---
I think that the current artist has a contract with supercell, and as soon as it expires they will switch
---
That‚Äôs the way it should be
---
What are you saying?! This is a masterpiece and you dont understand art
---
I did
---
Control your child Primo
---
No

That's super adorable! Love the colour scheme and to be honest love everything!
