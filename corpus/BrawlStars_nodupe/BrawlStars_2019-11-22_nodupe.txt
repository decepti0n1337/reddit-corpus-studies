gene copied dynamike
---
Teaming bitch!
---
Rip Shelly + gene losing animation combo. Good while it lasted.
---
its the same for boom box brock. But they got it for dynamike and nita and pam.
---
I checked out the files. there's a "brawliday box" it is probably gonna be that
---
Poor gene
---
Still no fix to the widely reported bug where characters get stuck in place and can't move...
---
üÖ±Ô∏èruh moment
---
i got my first mythic at 13k, but i was unlucky with that
---
What about first legendary?
---
checked out the files, said brawliday box in one
---
Why don't you dyna-jump off this thread before I beat yo ass!
---
üòÇ
---
No supercell should give you gems after buying that
---
Do you guys like sucking different corporation dicks? The purpose of Supercell is to make as much money as possible and the customers want as many free things as possible. Free market 101.
---
If you can play above 800 trophies with a Brawler, you can say that you‚Äôre good. No matter how many trophies you have.  15k can also be 500 with every Brawler and that isn‚Äôt hard anymore.

Leon suffered alot nerfs. He doesnt need another

And yet you TEAM up to gain an advantage, which I strongly don't believe in. They are SOLO game modes

Yes. I'll be back in a moment.

The real reason is overpopulation. Only drastic and radical changes will prevent further damage but those changes aren‚Äôt compatible with our lifestyle and will never be because of different factors.

What about a ten v ten showdown first to 20 kills and u keep power cubes

Yet he gets destroyed by almost every brawler

it‚Äôs sarcasm cos he typed like tHiS

You know having legendaries doesn‚Äôt automatically make you good at showdown right? It‚Äôs about the players skill. He might be good with legendaries,that doesn‚Äôt mean most of his wins come from legendaries.

The subreddit icons in the home page and in the popular/all are back to planets

Haha good job dude
---
If you‚Äôre not a sweaty nut who plays the game all day, yes. It is good.
---
The number of trophies and playtime are correlated. The more you play, the more trophies you win. The more trophies you win, the more opened boxes you have. The more boxes you have opened, the better chances of unlocking a legendary brawler should be.
---
Basically, the higher number of trophies should mean the higher changes of unlocking a legendary brawler.
---
what are you trying to say
---
El brown's punch looks like a tip of a dick

yo stop giving them bad reviews for ‚Äúmemes‚Äù

This sub has mods? And if they actually banned low effort posts, this sub would have 3 posts a day.
---
So what about solution? Showdown is gone
---
Yeah that‚Äôs probably one of the least useful star powers. Even his other one is kinda useless too cuz it‚Äôs not like you throw the super at your own teammates
---
its a German songtext I know my Language dude
---
Honestly I think she‚Äôs weak. I‚Äôm not sure what range you play at but at 700+ it‚Äôs almost impossible to land a hit with how slow the attack is.

it's jut hilarious how Brock is the only one that looks normal

Is that Leon‚Äôs super? I didn‚Äôt know he had one

I played 2-3h a day to get 20k and if you have One Hour what I expect then you could get at least 16k

Same I also ask for the xp level. There are people with 13k and only like level 70-90 and complain about not having a legendary.
---
He is from future, where Leon‚Äôs super is completely gone

Maybe they added it in the update
---
Hey I have 4 legendaries too
---
This is soooo cute

How?
---
Also hol up
---
Who‚Äôs the girl on the right?
---
Ive played (play) a lot in that Range from 600 - 700 and i can say it is the most toxic range in the whole game, because they think that they are pretty good but mostly I see people rushing into that enemy with 10 gems (I have to make some kills...) or rushing in the opponents base in bounty when we are ahead.
---
Maybe they play good with that brawler, but they are making other mistakes like picking the wrong Brawler, false positioning or wrong tactics. 
---
Above 800 I get rarely bad teammates, like before the trophy update when you was above 500, because you need a win rate above 50% and that can‚Äôt reach everybody.

If you want to make progress in the game as fast as possible you could save up gems to buy mega boxes but token doublers are actually more worth the gems

Crow isnt even the best legendary. He isnt a mess. Sandy and spike are the best idk I think that guy just thinks crow is op bcs hes a barley main...and crow is a really good counter to barley (no offense)

I hate how powerplay has snake prairie where within circling eagle bo you are at an extreme disadvantage
---
okay i didnt have reddit then lol
---
In north is winter lol
---
Idk
---
The new skins are nice
---
&gt;:(
---
And this is a anime-style art so you're unfortunately right.

Incredible!

OMG! It's cool, dude, but I'm being chased by uniformed men :(

Sin cara and kalisto:are we a joke to you

30 gems is way too cheap
---
You should swap "my playing showdown" with "trying to get first place"
---
"Then you died!"
---
Its not bear its default pet model
---
Are you good at brawl ball?Im looking for pro teammates,because I playing better a lot than my randoms and I want to take some brawlers on 30rank
---
No he aint.But he doesnt need any nerfs aswell

What is your point ? Its not clear, you post something to alert against these type of players but dont give a f.

Hello! Could I please use your clip in my Brawl Stars Highlights series? :) You would be properly credited in the video and in the description of the video. I won‚Äôt use the footage without your permission. If you‚Äôre interested, here‚Äôs our channel: [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt5A9Y-b\_TnvG6SKYpcPu3g](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt5A9Y-b_TnvG6SKYpcPu3g) . Thank you!
---
Exactly
---
üòÇüòÇWhat do u mean how! Everybrawler is unbalanced. Every game mode with the exception of brawl ball only has 3 or 4 brawlers that are competitive and if you don‚Äôt play those certain brawlers you get wiped. (By the way I‚Äôm talking about high trophy levels like 15000 to 20000 not 5000 where ur probably at)
---
Go right ahead my dude
---
They're not limited
---
Super: a bunch of mice, the "Fertilize" would work if the cat was eating the mice.
---
I don‚Äôt know about you but I personally don‚Äôt like losing that much with an unfair match up. This was basically a 2 on 3 with a ‚Äúteammate‚Äù that just makes you lose the game
---
They were probably playing with someone on the enemy team. You only unlock brawl ball later, they would only have gem grab at 0 trophies.
---
Thats pretty gud
---
aww those 2 stars ruined this pic
---
Looks better than most of Bibi's fanmade skins.
---
And it's KAWAIIIII
---
*laugh in penny
---
sadly most casual players maxe their shelly first. this is why all powerplay is flodded with shelly

furries ruining brawlstars
---
crow bull and bibi are from same retropolis theme... bull isnt in the offer becuause...
---
Today I just bought him :)
---
You must be really stupid to not know that brawl ball is not an available mode to zero trophy player and you need to win a gem grab against bots to play real match as someone with &gt; 50 IQ (*unlike you*)  pointed out in a separate comment.
---
Nope me too
---
No.  When he is launching his super, he is trying to increase his momentum.
---
chance to get this is double the chance of get a  leggy
---
Seejejdjdj
---
I feel like its name should be something like Waterworks or Desert Eagle or something along does lines
---
We got 3 consecutive Leon skins tho
---
8bit and piper again
---
oooh you are so talented. i wish i had skills like that. great job!
---
If I guessed right, wait til December cause the update will be really big, 1 year after global release
---
Of course, take what you want pal. Just drop a comment saying your Chanel name and I‚Äôll check it out !
---
Depends on the star power
---
Thank you take my upvote
---
I've beaten it many times I haven't got even a single clue why it's saying normal
---
Did your mom just take your phone from u? Cause you suddenly became inactive
---
thanks! :D

Teammate was afk for a bit and got killed. Randoms in a nutshell
---
It isnt even supposed to be funny, are u dumb?
---
a copy wow I hate this
---
MaggOts
---
ITs asia type and its so cool specially in korea, the hype is the cool emotes in their skin like leonard Carl when he starts attacking he leave like emote words at up left in his character you well understand when its release,
---
leonard Carl skin costs 80 gems
---
Elbrown primo costs 150 gems
---
Sally leon costs 80-150 gems
---
Updated the post :)
---
Ok boomer. But ive seen alot of poeple on this sub say that its broken and alot of pro players think the same. Bruh you just want leon to be broken like on the first day of his release.
---
Its weird me too
---
What the fuck?
---
Looks like frank v2
---
Why does bibi on the right look like jiro and tsuyu from mha combined
---
#T R Y
---
Yee
---
Nice skin idea
---
I want more art like this
---
I don't like any of them.  Leon and Primo look too childish, and the Carl skin just looks so horrible and awkward, like it's not even rendered properly.  Much like the Hog Rider Carl where the beard looks like it was added on with MS Paint.
---
Hahahahahaha
---
Brawl Stars itself its designed to look like it was made for 10yos. And the skins themselves are based on Lane‚Äôs Characters so....
---
With how many nerfs they put on him that put him down the shitter, I‚Äôd say he deserves it just a bit
---
Saves me doing it haha
---
I like the dark one, but 10k is way to much for a recolor of a skin I paid 59 gems for.
---
Hell, the freak, no. Crow needs nerfs, like immediately.
---
Although going pacifist is a good strategy. Killing an el primo at 600 hp is easy gems and you don't fear he will have revenge if the boss is at &lt;50%
---

*Humor flair*
---
Why do you use leon flair?
---
Did it
---
I guess, but it's just kind of a weird idea.
---
Your brain needs a buff.
---
No you cant. No star power can save you from shelly. Also his starpowers are kinda weak. They all only affect his super
---
Laughs in circling eagle
---
r/heavenlybrawlstars
---
I'm not a thief, I justo give ideas
---
OMG! Two people said the same thing in one session of Reddit. God no. Crow needs nerfs immediately. If you think he needs buffs, then you're not using him right.
---
Phone.

Thank you all for the compliments and nice comments, I really appreciate it! :)

Bye.
---
Should have made it 5 primos and one piper
---
U ain‚Äôt using crow right then. Are u one of those kids at 2k with crow
---
What was your legendary percentage when you got him? Or any of them for that matter
---
Its not bug
---
Well of course you want the most expensive one to be free. And also sally leon is way better than carl
---
What do you mean, they aren't limited.
---
He has a star power so it's probably to move faster, or since he just used it, he might be going to the left out of the bushes.
---
This isn't funny
---
In
---
When are they coming
---
Bibi's third star power is slowing bubble? As I know
---
I personally think you can either post it or send me in pm (I never tried Reddit messages so I don't know if it works)

There's no better deal than this.  GO FOR IT

I like it but I hope never to see it

U sure?

Stolen art?

99 DOLLARS????!
---
Yes, you can ;)
---
That link looks a little familiar...
---
If i had gems I would do it in a heartbeat.
---
Walter
---
You certainly have a creative mind my friend
---
Literally unplayable. Might as well delete the whole game now.
---
They will probably implement something to fix the trophy road because we alr have players reaching 30k which is double the current trophy road
---
Just had a look and there is no info about any of their attacks, Star Powers, description etc. They've even removed the attacks they gave BeeSniper a few weeks ago
---
50k
---
Well that‚Äôs a bit mean, he‚Äôs just expressing artistic freedom
---
I think you‚Äôre right I‚Äôll do it
---
2k nab with crow who plays him like a bull
---
There's no option to send a picture in pm on reddit, i tried(   
---
Maybe i create a post soon for you
---
Please stop this is the word of satan himself.
---
I've been playing since the android beta launched and I already have all the star points for every brawler, except EMZ, 9 of my brawlers have both star powers and the single brawler that I don't have is Sandy. I didn't spend any money in the game üëç
---
Sorry buddy, but I don't know.
---
he basically got 3 buffs, the first one being purely out of fanservice, he isnt overly op, for sure, but he for sure is unnecessarily stronger for what he is meant to do (crowd control)
---
Of course. I've been doing the same thing
---
I whould say yes cause i love crow but oh man you could buy a lot of skins with those sexy things
---
I knew him since 2013
---
He doesn‚Äôt have eyebrows even with a cool clothes
---
this is so good. it should replace white crow. great job!
---
The meta was complete garbage. nobody took any skill, it was really limiting similarly to takedown, and it was super defensive.
---
Id much rather play lone star where i can practice my 1v1s, play with calculated aggression and play an extremely wide meta of relatively high skill brawlers
---
You don't need to make actual physics for weight in the game, they just need to change the animations
---
And that‚Äôs how I survived! I am my own shield!
---
 I wish that there was a popular dogame
---
It's a counter to Bo's with circling eagle stap power and isn't funny.
---
I actually get mad at my friend, but randoms are way worse
---
I just bought it
---
Ah, I see you're a man of Clash Royale as well.
---
When the Mortis finds out the Tick knows how to throw in front of themselves
---
*profuse sweating*
---
I bought Leon with the skin , i only need Sandy!
---
Haha, I wish my teammates did this more often. I must be unlucky. ü§®
---
Who
---
Ctus
---
Lol..
---
Looks like its to late.
---
What money
---
Oof
---
do not bully me but dark mecha is best (pls don't hurt my emotions) whatever congrats to gold mecha crow
---
In Italian too
---
Let me explain:That Mortis is from a fake brawler cards wich sells with 1.99¬£ at least in my country
---
What‚Äôs wrong? Everything looks fine to me.
---
You are an intellectual.
---
try to post this on r/memes and get a lot of upvotes
---
I think you need to take a breath, friend.
---
I didn't know it's possible to have a gif as a profile picture
---
True
---
It is mine, I even have the 3D files and texture
---
I thought alchemist is better
---
‚Äúhow about a skin where spike isnt a cactus‚Äù
---
Snake Prairie Bounty is literally my favorite thing to do in Brawl Stars.
---
Oops my bad
---
Well done!
---
And they have ads great I can get my shotgun now
---
And
---
Love the reference
---
For me it was emz
---
I really like the brawler icon, really looks like an in game one!
---
About stats, idk if those are level 1 or 10 stats, but if it‚Äôs the second case then it seems pretty underpowered, since he doesn‚Äôt have any special ability that compensates them, like for example Bibi (not gonna mention too much about this since top comment already summarizes this well)
---
Just curious, why a bus as a super?
---
That‚Äôs 20 dollars in gems bro
---
Nope
---
Well its not a complaint
---
No Hat bad plz upvote
---
I think it doesn‚Äôt say who is a chick! In the brawl talk it says it in subtitles which means they‚Äôre secretly pointing out that the skins a girl I think
---
Que has hecho??
---
I thought thats part of the design?
---
True.
---
Happens to me a while back
---
u dont see the speed arrows so he has invisiheal
---
You forgot the funny
---
These are just bots designed to look like real people. These bots are low power level and will mostly only use trophy road brawlers
---
This shit boggles my mind, I‚Äôm at 9k and have very legendary
---
good game, came before brawl stars.
---
Stolen
---
Report it because it breaks /r/brawlstars rules for repetitive posts. It also breaks the "post titles must be descriptive rule."
---
perfection
---
They need to add a red one now.
---
I didnt notice the cloak but Crow‚Äôs fingers were maybe intentional
---
I wish we had some facts. Would be interesting to know. I think even I would be able to buy a gold mecha skin.
---
I have
---
10k right now
---
+
---
10k White Mecha Bo
---
10k Dragon night jessie
---
2√ó2,5k for Barley and Bull Skin
---
3√ó500 for Tara,Piper,Colt Skin
---
I think I spend 12k on boxes
---
=
---
48.5k
---
If I saved my starpoints I'd have 48.5k starpoints which means I would have been able to buy it on Monday.
---
Is this sarcastic?
---
Whats wrong?
---
Look at shiba nita‚Äôs bag strap
---
Yeah and this guy has been on reddit a year this is an intentional repost
---
Well theres always room for improvement right?
---
No emojies
---
Why tho
---
This game came first tho?
---
I‚Äôm not talking about graveyard shift
---
Leon has powers you have never seen in a mortal before
---
Pam is going to have a remodel
---
Oh thanks I'm so late by now

Im not pertaining to the slot. I was circling his leg. It clips through his body
