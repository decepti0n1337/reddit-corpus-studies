based on your luck, your next brawlers in march 2020
---
$33 USD is $45.81 Australian dollarydoos.  
---
I do good if I survive the initial skirmishes. But I always aggressively try to get a free box or two and just get deleted. Its probably on my play stile rather than the brawler himself. 
---
Elusive + worth $69,99 ?

Smh means shaking my head so you just said shaking my head my head

Leon? Contrary to popular opinion of this sub, i personally think Dyna son-of-a-bitch mike needs A LOT more attention from devs

Dei um novo efeito ao tiro dela e do morteiro para ver se ficava uma skin mais legal, mas pouca gente gostou.
---
I actually just got Tara right now two hours after I did this post. This post feels a bit weird now since I got a brawler after I complain not getting enough brawlers XD.
---
LOVE THIS 
---
Awful post

Its because OG is so good at the game he is able to push trash brawlers 
---
Trophies?
---
IMO the only thing worth spending on is the level packs. Your going down a slippery road if you start doing this. If you are already on that road then fuck ya 
---
Another awesome concept. üòÉüëçüèª

Ikr!! Thanks! üò¢

Spike x Crow

I remember sucking up to my parents when I wanted a new game lol. I‚Äôve got a job now so thankfully I‚Äôm just trying to convince myself not to buy it and eventually give in
---
Thanks for the hate!
---
Agreed, but you have to be good with him though 
---
Forgot to mention no one in my team is online and I‚Äôm eager to do this

Ok this game is not a high skill game. Thats a lie. It has an extremely low skill capped when compared to other Mobas. You literally only have 2 moves. This game is took maby elements from the the biggest Moba and most competitive game of all time, League of Legends, and dumbed it down to a mobile game. League has 140 characters each with 5+ unique moves and abilities, with customizable passive runes, and hundreds of buildable items, extreme team play, and one of the highest skill caps of any game. There's literally infinite game knowledge to learn. Its hard to say brawl stars is a skill game when its level based and there's so little mechanics there. Its addictive sure but come one. Those guys at lvl 1 at 500 obviously queue with high ass level teammates that carried them. Of course there are people good at that this game, but nobody is going to give a shit about a "brawl stars world tournament" because its games would look exactly like all the games at 500 plus trophies. In league, the biggest game ever, Challenger rank has 200 players. How is there so little? People actually have ways to demonstrate skill. You look up build guides, watch videos, practice skillshots, and learn the thousands of mechanics in the game, and then you lose because the other guy has more skill and understands the game better. Compare that to thinking you're the shit because you walked around a bush and auto attacked as a bull and killed someone. Literally ANYONE can do that. Im serious, you have no idea what a really skill based game is like.
---
You‚Äôre probably on the red team then
---
How about a new brawl ball map 
---

---
Oh ya well I can draw one of those legs in an hour
---
3 weeks and nerfed. Are we hoping new brawlers?
---
Now try it at power 6 on a a character that isnt a legendary. Headass
---
You got to understand that this guy is a god at the game. A average/good player will never get that far.
---
Yea
---
Ok, but there's no way to counter him really. You have to just hide in a bush, hope he doesn't shoot dynamites at you and also hope he gets close enough so you can tear his fucking face into mince mess with bull's big three barrel shotgun.
---
It's beautiful... ( Ôºõ‚àÄÔºõ)
---
Hello my baby, hello my honey,
---
Water gives advantage to long-ranged brawlers only.
---
Beta when it was just for canada like before it was globallt released and how many chests have you opened bc it global releases December and its January and you almost got every Brawler
---
Main problem with him is auto aim shotgunners which make it difficult to get through 1-350
---
 It's here give gem and cover photo
---
100*
---
What map
---
I just got the notification 
---
Buy it dude crow is hella fun
---
Ok first i will ask about that dang barrel, why and how does this genie take over darryl‚Äôs barrel. Those are private. Two I would definitely ask for an in-game map maker. It would be amazing to just make maps for fun and play them with friends in game and also post them in game and play online maps. Also maps can be upvoted to be considered to be a permanent map or a limited time map. And three why is your tag(lex) ‚ÄúYoutuber/Coffee Addict‚Äù thats not so good for you. Go try some colt crunch or some poco puffs(my idea)
---
How do you know that he is
---
Fun fact some swords do have this shovel/club like tip which makes them especially good for swinging
---
It's either a bull, a shelly or a maxed bo
---

Actually incredible , The light , the composition , the contrast of colors and that deep faces of the characters

Thats just lag
---
I think the 3D maps look amazing, however if I‚Äôm not mistaken water still looks the same. Maybe they could improve it somehow so water would match the rest of the map.

Practice Mode back so people with unstable connections can still get their daily tokens. It's also an easier way for players with all rank 20's to get their tokens as there is next to no incentive to push above 500 unless you have lots of time on your hands or you are pushing for leaderboards.
---
don't bother yourself. teaming in a match is approved as valid strategy by Supercell.
---
I don't get how people are not seeing problems with heroes
---
nice art.. good luck bro
---
Because having him as ur flair shows he‚Äôs ur favorite so obviously you wouldn‚Äôt want him to get nerfed, even though he‚Äôs the most broken character in the game. I actually have more then 1000 trophies btw, and the only way u were able to get past 1000 trophies was because u stole your moms credit card and bought Leon.
---
G: 8.5k

repost

Leon is so easy to kill when they play too aggressive.

I would like to see a Cupid bo skin for Valentine‚Äôs Day

Its it's from different person, its not a repost

I must've missed it

on a scale of 1 - 100 how sexy is lexy

10. I love skins (especially limited time ones). How about a winter Bo skins who wears a thick fur hat and coat?
---
No competition this is too good 
---
Club Box so we can all get Legendary Brawlers faster and process with the game. It will also keep players active on the game to have another thing to grind for. Team work will be needed for that and its gonna be an aswesome feature like the Clan Chest in Clash Royale.
---
I would like some better end game content, as once you get all your brawlers to 500 trophies, there really isn't a big incentive to push anymore. For example, the reward for reaching 14.5k trophies is only 150 coins. At that point, most players have a max account and already have lots of coins stacked up. I think adding a proper league system or special rewards like exclusive skins would be cool.

I would like to have free tournaments for F2P players with 5000+ trophies. For any age above 13 and rewards shouldn't be too big, like maybe few hundrend gems. 
---
Just 9500, but crow is the most annoying brawler if he gets played well, then he just poisons you then get away and when the poison get away he poisons you again, but he doesn't really do much damage and you have to have a good team who does damage but as crow you don't have to do damage you just poison the enemies so they can't heal
---
it's really not that big of a deal

Don‚Äôt spook me like that HAHA

nice art! penny is best girl

And then you take a 7 trophy hit

No more throwlers. Thank you

I‚Äôm at 4.5k with only 15, but you don‚Äôt see me whining on the brawl stars reddit.

Check out my post, I got sands undertale from shop offer I mean box!!!11!

haha thx bro

Don't get me started on her dragon knight skin

Smugler Leon!

His standard skin has a kid like visual, but his atitude would fit perfectly as a street smugler!

I know this is a very hard concept to learn okay but hear me out:

If you don‚Äôt like a map, **don‚Äôt play it**
---
Yeah but i gotta flex the spike lol üòÇüòÇ
---
Easier brawler unlock for people who play a lot ( like a daily quest thing)
---
Just dumb how round restarts do not restart environment. Had a Barley use his ULT last second of a round in Brawl Ball, and when the next round starts, our entire team is just standing in the fire taking free damage.

Oh dope.
---
Didn't notice it till you mentioned it. Congrats.
---
Yeah I watched a video and got it figured out.
---
i like it
---
honestly I kinda hate el primo but add this and I'll kill on showdown lol
---
I really like this one! It tells a story that we all know. 
---
What would be even better is if Nita was a tiger. üòÇ
---
I love it though.
---
I can‚Äôt play showdown anymore when I‚Äôm power thirteen and Leon gets me in three shots at power 4

This looks like some google daily names or whatever.

The watermark is in the top right Kinemaster

The star power and regular attack.
---
How much health does it have?
---
Pretty much. A 3-4 power level advantage can be overcome with skill
---
Here a story for ya. I was at lvl 27 when they released this. I was short the gems. Did the math, and thought "if I reach Lvl35 I'll be able to do the to buy the deal and get chest for it. That way I'm not completely throwing money into this game." so I grinded pretty damn hard. Didn't know there was an xp cap. Now I'm 15xp away from lvl 35 and the deal is ending soon. I took a chill day yesterday. Feels bad man. 
---
This needs more likes
---
Nice
---
What‚Äôs the bug??
---
So true
---
Honestly this irritates me. If supercell put time in to creating more content just to take it out, what‚Äôs the point?
---
Woa
---
ey don't say that, it's better art than mine
---
I am at 9100 and I have every brawler maxed. But I have played since the game launched.
---
As far as I know, supercell does not make the lines themselves. They say they need a voice actor, look at the submissions, pick the one they think is best, tell them to do something along the lines of 
---
\- Do 3 getting hurt lines
---
\- Do 3 getting killed lines
---
\- Do 3 getting a kill lines
---
\- Do 3 respawn lines
---
Skill i dont have with dynamike yet, thos are my third and fourth game with him and im still getting used to the way dynamike shoots.
---
What is the bug? 
---
Pre global...
---
Very good post!
---
I have a 1000 trophy barley and I completely disagree lmao. Mortis is THE hard counter for throwers. 
---
I don't see a map
---
Best of Luck Francy
---
hey, I stopped playing a long time ago (back when it was still vertical) and just started playing again. How does Darryl‚Äôs super charge passively? And do any other brawlers have this ability?
---
"Frozen to the ground" isn't a stun - They can still reload and shoot, making it more of a delay tool. I don't think it's too strong.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
But looking at the basic attack, 3600 for all stabs may be too good. I'll lower it to 600 - 900 - 1100 in the revision. But keep in mind it only works if all three stabs hit a single target.
---
Thnks!!!
---
It would look so much better if you removed the brawl stars logo
---
I‚Äôd also like to know, considering I have all rare and super rare and it‚Äôs the same for me.
---
Is poco okay
---
Are we thinking 1 straight/large attack width dagger shot like in CR or multiple narrow attack daggers in a spread attack like you indicated saying ‚ÄúIce Daggers‚Äù
---
done before but funny
---
Happy cake day.
---
I can remove the logo but then I would have to repost, but thank :)
---
JESUS frank is B I G

That's dope

Leon's like naruto
---
It ain‚Äôt working man
---
1 single dagger. 
---
20 mins :D
---
If you have at least 5k trophies which is quite easy, and play constantly, you can get any new brawler you get to 400 easily. Unless you're a dumb nub like me. Cause you played all the time against them and also watch some youtube.
---
Fred was later annihilated
---
Lol what? So you mean to say the Leon I got from my saved boxes existed even before his release?!? Cooooool.
---
Magic archer was a truly OP card as a support; unless you mean OP as a card with pekka damage and goblin hp

That number isn't important, just something visual. And chances don't go up that fast, be patient

Upvote to show hate over TEAMERS

You love it , I hate it, don't get me wrong I love soccer itself, but brawl ball, man, I think cos when I solo - the players out there spoil it for me.

What is the bug
---
I think you‚Äôre bullshitting bc I‚Äôve tested this when saving a bunch of boxes in order to obtain power points for a character I didn‚Äôt have and then opening all of them when I did get that character in the trophie road, but oh well maybe it was pure coincidence, I prefer to think you‚Äôre lying though.
---
I really like this idea! Whenever someone says they want a teleport in this game or a person that can make portals, I always think of two different concepts with the abilities being their super. This is actually a pretty balanced way of putting the two together and making the brawler very unique.
---
(My answer to the deleted comment)
---
Sorry, I just checked your profile...
---
I saw the Piper skin earlier, and as this sub is sadly filled with reposters, I thought you had stolen it :(
---
Last tuesday, there was a guy that made a collage similar to this one with 2 stolen Leon skins by "his friend with no internet connection". 
---
It‚Äôs so annoying how all the noobs have Leon now
---
Skins but the main idea is to give a base to super cell to work so is much easier if i just du it whith this pictures cuz 3d is too hard 
---
Oh
---
 ok no worries man it happens :D
---
lmk if you need a mortis in brawl ball
---
Iirc from -7, to -1 at 6th place, 0 at 5th place and +7 at 1st place
---
This made my day
---
.1 is not bad, mine stuck at .0336. I have 2 led tho
---
Also, don't forget: El Primo getting hit by a meteor and gains superpowers.
---
Yes he means in solo, but not in duos
---
Are you serious?  Ever played clash royal? 
---
I can imagine it, it looks cool
---
Thanks
---
No I think someone either got 5 or they got a star power also
---
Ok thanks
---
Get Spike with a brawl box at 2.5k, gem for leon
---
Spike standing among cacti is the new picture of nothing labeled Leon 
---
Fell free to tell me some of your ideas for a skin i'll be glad to make it for you guy's

---
It's a #THICC BABY BEAR
---
True, only Leon users will say he doesn't need a nerf
---
Tbh bro I got Leon the day before he went all global in the shop and he's fun to melt with. Im still getting used to him though.
---
Very nice!
---
Not playing the right brawler then. What brawler were you using in what game mode?
---
Randoms
---
Spike in brawl ball, then duo Showdown 
---
Bo ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
You gain 0.01% every 100 boxes
---
As Mortis, Dynamike was the easiest opponent to take out in showdown.
---
No Dynamike stood a chance against my Mortis.
---
Since the global release, yes. Legendary offers were constantly around 760-780 gems during beta though.
---
Yeah
---
Lmao I thought it was fairly obvious but it‚Äôs both the internet and reddit üòÇ
---
That‚Äôs killing it
---
Love the leon and piper
---
This is amazing, it should be called 'Tribal Frank' as that name seems to fit better with the skin idea.
---
Here‚Äôs what I think would be a perfect balanced out Leon.  (If they do decide to make a larger change)  I think 10% off of his max close range damage needs to happen.  
---
       As a result bulls, and Shelly‚Äôs would probably take over, as would other sharpshooters I believe.  I think a balanced Leon needs:
---
-10% off max damage
---
- maybe a 3% increase to max range damages, cuz it‚Äôs pretty weak pre level 5.. or we could hope to make his max damage be weaker, less blades, or even more damage off his close
---
- I can see them making his close-mid range engagements still pack that punch that the up close n personal ones guaranteed, by adding a more generous strength distance.
---
so true
---
I‚Äôd love to see a bo skin üòÇ
---

I wouldnt be talking

What the heck did you just fucking say about me, you little bean? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the sharpshooting academy, and I've been involved in numerous secret  raids on Kaboon Canyon, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I'm the top sniper in the entire Brawl Stars armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the heck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my hecking words. You think you can get away with saying that poop to me over the Internet? Think again, sub 1000er. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the World and your SuperCell ID is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're at 0hp, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can snipe you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my normal attack. Not only am I extensively trained in sniping, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the Brawl Stars Map Pool and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable butt off the face of the continent, you little poop. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little "clever" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your noob tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn geniusn't. I will poop fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're a power 1, kiddo.
---
This Season is over, which means that every brawler above 500 trophies loses hald of their trophies above 500 (ex: 550-&gt;525) making your overall trophies go doen aswell.
---
An annoying fucking midget
---
10, I would love to have seasonal skins! But I would also love for it to be a one time thing, if the skins are available the next time the holiday or event happens, then it will be a slap in the face for the OGs who got it when it first came out
---
Also those trophy counts ...
---
Good old memes
---
This is one of the best memes I‚Äôve seen in a while!
---
BoomerBang (name can be changed) 
---
Attack would be throwing a boomerang that either does a U and flies back, or go straight forward then back, star power would be throwing multiple boomerangs
---
The Title Would Be Rock Enclosure
---
Im lvl 36, playing since Global Release, 2700 Trophies, 20/22 Brawlers(only one missing is Spike)
---
Its just a game of luck with those boxes i guess.
---
It has been done well, however, some of my club mates still have lag due to the 3D update, a way to tone down the graphics would be nice
---
If you wish to not die against Dynamike, then try to react to his throws while those sticks are on their way. Paying attention to his throws is the key to dodge his damage. He is actually outranged by Brock, Piper and Rico. Also, bunny hopping is a hard to learn skill with him, there was a post in which you could see Dynamike bunny hop into the gas in Showdown, and the other 4 players died, while he lived because the gas can't hurt you mid-air. Pulling this off needs you to be able to throw dynamite sticks really close to you consistently. Doing that with the joystick thingy is much harder than with tap to fire.

Beta player, you used to be able to unlock him from boxes

How do you manage to create a directional button + r1?

I can just add the simple button R1

Why are you posting this here? To brag? Kid please

thanks!

It's absolutely beautiful

Best of the best I will print it and make copies 
---
It must've took you so much time
---
The opposite, Barley is so much better
---
thanks! its definitely doable!
---
* Thinking  about the 3D/Leon update until now what do you feel has been done well  and what do you think could have been done better?
---
Leon is overbroken, indeed and esport will be not doable with a nerf of him.
---
* On  a scale of 1-10 how interested are you in seasonal/special skins? Bonus  internet points awarded for your best idea for a future seasonal skin!
---
On hearthstone, seasonal skin is an easily reward.
---
* Where do you see the future of Brawl esports going and what would an ideal event format look like to you?
---
Esport, we have to remove some broken random effect of maps (powercube positions, power juices, meteors and some too random effects), but i believe its possible
---
* You  awake one morning to find a Brawl Stars Magic Genie in your room (he  took over Darryls barrel...don't ask). You have only ONE wish that can  be granted that allows you to add a feature into Brawl Stars. What would  you add to the game to make it better?
---
A better clan support and daily clan quest features
---
Where did u see this info?
---
Happens to me quite often, sometimes only on my second attack, so not caused by long playtime / memory leak (and on iPad Pro too). There‚Äôs nothing worse than a -7 when you‚Äôre trying to push trophies in Showdown ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
No one understands that Leon has hard counters, mostly tanks, if you get killed by a Leon in showdown it's only because you're too squishy... He's still kind of an assassin
---
When a brawler is hiding in a bush they can counter him because he can‚Äôt see inside a bush while they can see him coming closer
---
Well aggro brawlers (Like Nita, Brock, El Primo, Darryl, Mortis, Leon etc.) are supposed to focus on getting kills instead of getting gems unless it‚Äôs emergency so they can keep enemies away from the gem carrier (Jessie, Bo, Poco, Penny, Pam etc)
---

so iam fine on an ipad air1?

Damn leon looks cool

---
You should have included the next scene when he magically appears next to a ranged brawler and instantly kills it because you don‚Äôt stand a chance of winning. Thanks supercell for giving us zero chance of defending against this trick.
---
It means that someone (your friends or clanmate) is spectating you
---
good luck hahaha
---
lol what does that mean? :D
---
I also got leon when global release while my legendary brawler percentage is at 0.01%.... what a pull
---
Removed - DO NOT SUBMIT POSTS WITH TITLES IN ALL CAPS. CAPS LOCK IS CRUISE CONTROL FOR COOL
---
two words. max bo
---
Another guy who wants to make the community toxic witch such posts.
---
I reached 5000 very quickly (only started at global launch), but I still only have 14/22 üò¢. The power on most of my brawlers are less than 5 though, and only 1 is above 7.
---
I think it would be nice if he had a true counter to long range brawlers such as Brock or Piper (without being another long range brawler), which seems like the most viable options in a lot of maps and gamemodes.
---
My proposal is *Strawy*. It would look kinda like a scarecrow with boxing gloves.
---
Its attack would be a 360¬∫ spin that deals meium damage to all enemies around in a low range, kinda like El Primo or quite higher.
---
For its super, it would be similar to Darryl, but instead of just bouncing on walls, it would also let Strawy bounce on brawlers, and after each bounce it would go to the nearest brawler, kinda like Jessie's attack. Basically it would work like a spinning top.
---
And the best was reserved to the end. Its star power would let Strawy use his basic and/or super (not sure if it would be OP with both) to give back a projectile. This means he could spin to throw back a Brock's rocket for example, but it wouldn't work with attacks with multiple bullets such as Colt or any shotgunner, since it can only give back 1 projectile at the same time.
---
I would really love to see a brawler like this, not necessarilly Strawy but the mechanics of it.
---
its not rare at all between players that just started playing the game and only played 2-10 matches.
---
Bruh I actually feel bad for people like you because I play brawl Stars since the landscape update and before the global release I unlocked crow(21/21)and it‚Äôs actually really sad because it‚Äôs lucky nothing else.when I unlocked spike I didn‚Äôt have Even all mythicals.So someone‚Äôs chance of winning a legendary is 0567% while another is 2% and they can unlock a leggy in the same day or even the guy with lower % can win leon and spike in sequence.So it‚Äôs luck just that,i can unlock leon tomorrow or in a week or in a month or even next year.I think supercell needs to make a way to unlock leggys easier(my opinion)
---
Shelly is counter to all of those brawlers but ok... XD
---
Yep. I have 8.300 trophies (8.4max)
---
I have been playing for months.
---
And still no legendary, while some noobs already got Leon and Spike? Wtf
---
So unfair, and these noobs even do this posts...
---
Please
---
Leon nerf! No buff him
---
How to disable play store check?
---
Bo is the worst 
---
Some people just want to watch the world burn...
---
Yes
---
*dynamike
---
If it‚Äôs the perfect Nita map, then I guess it‚Äôs bound to happen eventually. I‚Äôve seen lots of Mikes in Showdown maps before.
---
But if Bo has his star power in some maps is he the best brawler you can choose. 
---
30min or 30 hours
---
Facts
---
Ignore these hate coments actually congrats you lucky bastard!i hope you get crow soon!
---
im getting a little of a seven deadly since fib
---
Can I use your clips in my video with full credit?!
---
I think Barler is a bit better than Dyna
---
Edit: 
---
Misleading title = He bought Leon and then unlocked back-to-back-to-back Mortis, Piper and Crow (brawl box, brawl box, big box).
---
He bought Leon from the offer and unlocked Mortis, Piper and Crow back to back (brawl box, brawl box, big box).
---
30 min 
---
and what would the super look like?
---
This is the best yet in my opinion
---
Sure no prob ^^
---
There's no fan art just cut brawlers and other things
---
It will
---
no, rares are incredibly easy to get, you would just be wasting your gems
---
Exactly
---
Having two brawlers as a character seems kinda out of the ordinary. Maybe have a super that spawns a clone of yourself, dealing the same damage by copying your moves(delayed by half a second). The clone will have similar health to tara‚Äôs summon from her star power, having 2000 health.
---
Repost!
---
There's a guy who posted getting 2 legendaries from one box and it's without mass opening boxes to the point where it would be unlucky to not get a legendary. Now THATS luck. 
---
I got this from a friendü§∑
---
Nothing wrong with it 
---
I don‚Äôt Think it‚Äôs Spike I Think it‚Äôs a cactus.
---
I just got penny from a previous box so it's 0.105%
---
Lol
---
Somewhat around 8. And for skin ideas, go see my profile: Werewolf Bo for Hallooween and a Chinese New Year Brock who could shoot fireworks!
---
‚ÄúSo we have no new brawlers, no new game modes, no new maps... I‚Äôm gonna have to give this *unveils shirt*‚Äù
---
80 HP
---
Buy the weakest level Powers in the shop when you can. When I unlocked dynamike he would prob still be level like 2 if I didn't buy him off the shop when I could. Your brawlers should just naturally level up pretty fast
---
Yup
---
Dam
---
So it's fine, but then it turns the game into best of 1 from a best of 3? "Also, if you wanna get the ball back just have a minimum of 2 players on your team alive, pressure from both sides and make sure you wipe the enemy team all at once because you'll easily get fucked by spawn immunity." It's not cheap, it's disgusting. They didn't intend this.
---
it isn't the best to spend your gems on skins, but if you really want to I would suggest getting dragon knight jessie instead
---
But also brawlers did less damage cause they had less health if you look at Nita but they made everyone have more health fro easy balancing 
---
No
---
#T H I C K

That's what happens at super low trophies

When my teammate have 10 gems.

Are you free to play?

---
I'm subbed bro
---
Uhhh... where? I can‚Äôt seem to find anything. 
---
r/doublewoooosh
---
Probably something that could change form with it's super, either by entering in an "enraged mode", by entering a mecha or something else in that vein.
---
Good times
---
Thanks man!
---
Yes before auto aim 
---
4k here and 17 brawlers because I bought the pack of epics, haven¬¥t unlocked a mythic or a leggie yet.
---
Same, personally I think he is balanced if you get 300+ trophies because people know how to fight him, but below 300 most people don't know how to counter him.
---
We needed more time to prepare. The subreddit is going to get flooded
---
Give me some of those gemsüòÇ
---
Good job! That must require a lot of time and dedication to the game. 11617 total trophies at that moment.
---
Meanwhile, I'm just with 3 brawlers at 300.
---
Why‚Äôs the inbox and your yt pfp blurred out lmao
---
I've had both mythics and spike since my first month playing. If it makes you feel any better, I don't have piper, Leon, or crow :) 
---
Really I don't understand why you people have to create a post every time they do a server maintenance break...
---
Lol barrel bot
---
wldve upvoted till i read shithole

Ripped off my meme üò¢

exactly what i thought trying to login tn
---
Anyway to see your luck counter or have a tracker track your pulls to percentages ? 
---
You're definitly blind. Consider talking to a doctor.
---
Maintenance usually means they are fixing issues. I‚Äôm hopping for fixes over a Leon nerf
---
Ah, no wonder it‚Äôs such a hit in America
---
Respect for the hard work, but its colt who's supposed to be the centre brawler, not pam.
---
boy oh boy 
---
You already have first place in my heart üíú 
---
Crow does not need a buff imo, because if they buff him then everyone can play him well. A balanced brawler imo is one that can be played well if you know what your doing.
---
#FBI OPEN UP
---
How is Brock a gurl Wut
---
You‚Äôre getting nerfed. XD
---
Mom said its my turn with the skin slot
---
I hope its a leon nerf
---
Its just a matmaking maintenance it‚Äôs not a patch note look at their Twitter 
---
Oh look a noob with s maintenance break post üôÑ
---
Yea happened to me too.. You just gotta swipe the app outta ur ram then re-open it.. Dont worry you wont lose any trophies since you never connected.
---
I was gonna enter but after seeing this no way
---
Bad
---
Sorry did not understand.
---
Repost and no hat
---
Shelly, Bull and Leon teamers have no honor, 100% will betray you.
---
it‚Äôs a Darryl and Piper Nerf, and Pam and Leon are being buffed 
---
lul Thats my screenshot
---
Hopefully balance changes 
---
Probably not this happens to lots of people a lot
---
Well, you‚Äôre not helping.
---
Repost?
---
The game has only been out for about a month now, so I think it's still to early to say what kind of fame it will achieve. So far it seems fairly successful.
---
They have acknowledged the issue with the space behind the goal and are working on fixing it.
---
Also the delay issue might be due to your phone and not the servers, but I can't say for sure.
---
Just bug fixing, no balance changes... :(
---
Honestly it‚Äôs all about how you play this game. We all learned quickly to not walk near a bush in showdown bc a bull or primo will be in there. 
---
To counter Leon you just need to know to either not take the fight and let him get distracted with chasing you and have someone else take him out or get him to waste his shots. 
---
Pam at low trophies is incredibly good but once you get above 100 trophies with her you‚Äôll go against people who realize that if a Pam is in the middle lane in gem grab you just need to bait out her shots and then rush her all at once. Or take her down from the sides. 
---
He was playmaker now he's sharpshooter
---
I actually laughed
---
Don't gem carry with mortis unless the alternative is the enemy team getting those gems, or if you can put your team at 10+ and enemy team can't catch up within the countdown. In the latter case, you're golden as it's nearly impossible to hunt down a mortis in gem grab who is solely avoiding you and staying alive.
---
Mortis is very good at creating space and assassinating as well as threatening to clean up low health enemies and doing so. 
---
Exactly!
---
E L P R I M O I S H E R E
---
Piper is Sniper. You just skipped it.
---
Dude i didn't even know. Thanks tho. Guess ill wait in Reddit itself
---
But as leon you can kill tanks if you just doesn't try to close range kill them. Bull, el primo and darryl just have close range so you just have to hit them from a distance and even on close range you can outdamage darryl, so the only way a leon can get killed is when he gets to a bush were a bull or el primo is camping
---
This would be awesome! A story mode for that brawler whenever you unlock that brawler
---
Wow nice job man !
---
how about the trophies road, can you guys change the gold to something else,I‚Äôm at 11k and I haven‚Äôt collected none of my awards since 9k because I have no use of gold.
---
I got 0 bonuses, and from the 5000 I got 3 gems
---
Yep
---
What‚Äôs with spike checking out his eagle ‚Äúeye‚Äù?

Rip, I was hoping for balance changes

Wow! Thats a good picture of mortis!

Been out for 1.6 years
---
I only like the Piper
---
No it isn‚Äôt. Matchmaking update
---
It‚Äôs above the belt 
---
Come on ahha_97, get with the flow...
---
Maybe not. I've played him at lvl 8 on teams of all 600+ successfully in grab, but he does get hard countered regularly. If enemy team switches off and protects each other against you, then it's very hard indeed. He shines when a teammate is pressuring and you're chasing them down. 
---
It probably will but not right now
---
More like TrickShotLoser
---
That's a repost of a repost lol
---
I think Darryl should be reclassed from Heavyweight to Skirmisher.
---
Crow should also be a Skirmisher 
---
Honestly people just don‚Äôt realize that with MOBA‚Äôs and other games that also have different characters that it‚Äôs not all going to be perfectly balanced and you have to learn to out play a better character. That‚Äôs the point of having characters that are better and ones that are worse. They all have a spot that they are good at and if you learn to play them in that role you‚Äôll win but if you learn how to counter say a barely or dynamike in heist it immediately makes it so that you are going to win more times then not
---
That breaking bad reference tho xD
---
Facts!
---
Also Pam is a dude.
---
Wtf
---
Yeah the whole thing, good comment
---
Superpowers aren't in the game and they are extremely likely I got them in the first week of having a level 9 brawler
---
But this is arguably more important 
---
At happens all 10-20 games just close the game and reopen it
---
Its maintenance ffs
---
Same here
---
Nita!

Its just fixing matchmaking. Thats it.

I like crows design in game. Goddamn you took that and cranked it up to 11. Hell of a  good job!
---
Well done!
---
It's during my lunch break at work, server maintenance is usually fine, go nerf Leon and Buff Bo lmao.
---
No it‚Äôs not arguably. It‚Äôs way more important and might be the reason that people are thinking Leon is too good. They might be going against Leon‚Äôs that are way higher trophies then them. 
---
The last update they said they will have one new map, then they released 12 so im not expecting anything

It's done now, what changed?

Yes I hope for that bug to be fixed; it‚Äôs just so annoying. Thank you for your reply tho üëç

Jake the Bank Teller:
---
Rarity: Mythic
---
Health - 3200
---
Attack - Throws 3 envelopes in a straight line, each .25 seconds behind the previous one.
---
Damage - 425 x 3
---
Range - like Colt
---
Move speed - regular
---
Super - throws a bin of money, causing his opponents to stop and pick them up (so basically a freeze spell) for 1.4 seconds. (Time is what is upgraded)
---
Star power - Drops a coin every 3 seconds that disappears after 5 seconds. If anyone steps on the coin they will stop to pick it up (.1 seconds stun). Basically this is so that if a tank is pursuing him the tank will be slowed down so that the bank teller can get out of range, or if a brawler with multiple bullet shots shoots their shot will stop without using full amount eg. ricochet shooting only 3 of 6 bullets)

When Brock was being developed he was most likely a girl. Just like Pam is mini gunner dude.
---
I‚Äôm not going to play it, but since sc locks their brawlers behind lock boxes, and locks the lock boxes behind timegates and paywalls, you have to play maps, you play every map and every mode atleast to get star coins, and a dev as big as sc is shouldn‚Äôt make such painfully broken maps, the way (the way they designed the map) that you win on this map is to sit in a bush and wait to one shot someone. It‚Äôs not competitive and when I lose trophies because of simply just bad design it‚Äôs frustrating. And when I know I‚Äôm going to lose trophies because I see how the map is laid out as it‚Äôs panning in its infuriating.
---
Wow you did this?
---
What happened to the pipe line Ryan kept talking about 
---
Yeah :3 you like it ??
---
Wow Jeff, looks you guys put in the research. I haven't really thought about the top tier mm that much but everything you said here makes sense. Hopefully SC sees this and can address it in some manner. 
---
poco thicc 
---
what mode u play
---
I care because this is new to me. I never see someone get 3 brawlers in one box before.
---
Noobs

**Capture The Flag**
---
Rules: players must bring the other teams flag to your base if you die with flag the flag goes back to the other teams base while holding the flag you have a %10 walking speed buff %50 health buff and a %75 attack and super damage decreased you require 2 flags to win at overtime fog covers %20 of the map and you gain %15 more walking speed
---
People: 5v5 or 3v3
---
Size: showdown map or brawl ball map
---
Mods: meteor, healing mushrooms and energy drink which can‚Äôt be picked up by flag carries
---
can u make a skin for piper
---
Yes, in the store, tap on a big or mega box and click the ‚Äúi‚Äù button in the top right corner, it shows your chances
---
Oh I'm dumb I thought you said you have no legendaries
---
I am really find teammates and I‚Äôm sick of random, so I‚Äôm just pushing showdown all by myself. Got spike to 500 last week in health drain mode, right now I‚Äôm working on bull
---
That doesn't help, allows you to distinguish between them so you'll know you teamed with "player 2"

Just have the normal usernames

Vlw, mano! N√£o sabia que tinham tantos Brs aqui no Reddit

Well when I want to push trophies with someone who‚Äôs not in the meta (for ex, Brock, Spike, Mortis), I play duo with my friends that are pushing with brawlers that are in the meta (Bull, Shelly, Frank etc).

What are shards? I know power points, gold, tokens and star tokens. But shards...?

That'd be great, I'm sure you'd get some activity. I just don't know if I can be saved at this point lol. I am artistic on the musical side of the spectrum, but was never great at drawing/painting. Maybe just need a better teacher ;)
---
Oops completely forgot about the hat. My bad.
---
1st Brawl ball 2nd duo on showdown hot maze 3rd gem grab deep siege as a distraction and kill low hp brawlers that can kill you easily kill throwers especially 
---
At least you have leon
---
No, normal atk can cross brawlers but not walls
---
Winner for sure
---
Notice his legendary rate
---
AHAAH
---
Absolutely
---
Requesting Power points in your Club, you get power points and the donator gets some Tokens or exp or both, maybe trading power points too or sth.
---
Removing Autoaim in E-sport tournaments, no auto aim Queue for pros to train and spectating live high level games of non club members.
---
Lastly and most importantly showdown rewarding Kills or reducing points lost for players that died and had at least 1 kill. Maybe the 3-4 bottom players that lose points are the ones that didn't have kills and not the once that just died after 1 or 2 kills. Makes no sense a guy with 2 kills maybe losing 4-5 points and a guy that forgot he entered a game and was afk in a bush but survived top 5 not losing any.
---
I have a crow. XD
---
He is good in showdown because he has longer distance than Primo, Bull, Shelly, and he has a faster movement speed than other brawlers.
---
I am almost sure that he can read
---
He‚Äôs super is balanced but his damage at long range is still too high
---
That explains a lot. If I'm right legendaries decrease your chance by 0.06-0.07
---
Roadhog confirmed for brawl stars then 
---
U FURGOT ABOUT L3ON!
---
The best game mode for him is gem grab?
---
Your post isn‚Äôt interesting enough. All you did is put a guy singing. I don‚Äôt think this should be on here. 
---
Not in showdown. Which is the complaint. 
---
69% and I still don‚Äôt have Leon or Crow 
---
I see your view of things but I think barley is in a really good position right now. He is not supposed to be able to kill tanks. He is meant for consistent damage and area control. In the 3v3 modes if you land a couple shots your teammates should be able to finish them off (if they are not randoms). His super literally does the most damage in the game right now so I don't know what your on about. And he has burst potential if you land all 3 shots and get the first and second tick. Most tier lists put barley really high. 
---
i play overwatch and can see how high the skill cap goes, buuuuut for a mobile game, it can require also skill. everyone can level up any character as long as they have them. its not always dependent on levels. in my matches, its up to skill and i have never payed money. above 10.5k as well
---
That's mediocre as fan art. But would be the undisputed BEST SKIN in the game!
---
Barley is fine, I play him all the time. Btw his super, if all shots land in the same area, does some of the most damage out of supers in the game. Dynamike has team land both sticks to deal full damage, and barely has to burn for the same effect. He is fine, and has been so for a while now. Btw dynamike is debatable worse, not the other way around.
---
I was sorta getting bored of the game, the I bought him...been playing non-stop for like a week now
---
Well I didn‚Äôt realize i was talking to a veteran in interesting posts :) last time i checked i can post whatever I want xD

&gt; Bull obviously needs banning from showdown 
---
????
---
Wheat?

What was the point of your post then?

Thanks for the explanation! I still think it's unfair to drop someone's legendary chances if they didn't get a legendary. They should drop epic chances instead. :/

---
Yeah not fake m8, people have gotten as high as 4 on video.
---
Are they teaming in showdown???
---
Gamer girls aren‚Äôt real. Lol
---
Yeah and I'm sure nobody will cares about what you have to say. Who bullied you as a child?
---
Gem grab and brawl ball are the best gamemode for her
---
I wish‚Ä¶ that I never have to see Darryl without his Barrel on! Also, and I will refrain from dropping the obvious things like an actual end game, Club Wars, a 5v5 mode, etc., **I would love to see Progressive Events!** 
---
*Say you have an event that spans 72 hrs.* The event rotates Game Mode and map every 3 hours and it‚Äôs separate from the regular trophy progression. Instead you get special Event Points when you win, and you lose some when you lose a match. You can end up on negative points, because there is no lower limit, but the rewards at the end of the event is based upon your highest score during the event. So, if you make it up to +30 and then drop down to -5, you‚Äôll still be rewarded for +30.
---
**Each Event can have special rules and here are some examples:**
---
*Randoms only* - You cannot queue as a team, you must play with random teammates.
---
*Random compositions* - There is a pool with randomized team compositions and each team will get one of these compositions. Then each player will get a random Brawler for that team. (Including Brawlers you haven‚Äôt unlocked yet)
---
*Speed Grab* - Gem Grab, but it‚Äôs first to 5 gems!
---
*Speed Bounty* - It‚Äôs Bounty, with only for 90s.
---
*Speed Heist* - It‚Äôs Heist, but‚Ä¶ you get the point! (Less HP on safes)
---
*Overtime Brawl Ball* - First goal wins!
---
*Double Elimination* - Showdown, but the gas spawns twice as fast, meaning the map will shrink really fast!
---
The point of these evens is to provide a fun, fast and crazy alternative to the regular trophy grind! The rewards at the end should provide enough incentive to play it seriously, but they should not feel mandatory to get. *These events could also be a nice way to introduce some different maps, that perhaps are a bit too far ‚Äúout there‚Äù for the regular rotation.*
---
Cheaters!!!!
---
I'm at .2064 which is the percentage immediately after yours and only have spike currently
---
Well yes but this one wasnt announced so its probably just bug fixes.
---
Yeah but ghost rider is a skeleton and he has a similar bike lol
---
We can hope
---
Significant nerf to autoaim/quickfire once you‚Äôve pushed past a certain trophy count. Every 1000 trophies after 3000, I would propose a 5% damage nerf to all autoaimed attacks. So by 5000 trophies, autoaim would have received a 20% damage nerf. 
---
Best artistic post so far.
---
Tf you mean what's going on, it says on the screen. Maintenence. Use your brain please.
---
Yeah, Skirmisher seems to be a lot more fitting for Darryl. Although I'm not too sure about Crow, since he doesn't have that much hp and his super is pretty assassin-like. But you're right, Crows playstyle also reminds of a skirmisher. 
---
Awesome congrats, it's a great feeling. My first to 500 was Mike, still one of my favourite brawlers.
---
Lol i didnt get a new brawler for 2 months

Am I missing something?

You must be new to the game don't you? Life leech does drops rarely in 2 weeks and I believe next life leech event would come this week. If your point is Life leech and angry robo never came on 3v3 gamemodes then **yes they never came in 3v3 gamemodes and that they're suit best to showdown.** I Guess there's a fix rotation of events.

Barrel bots name is not barrelbot its Darrell

penny in sd is pretty good if there are two boxes lined up and you dont always get only one box. plus not every sd map is good for every brawler. i sometimes play on my brothers account who is not very high level and i literally carry teams. i get his brawlers to around 350 trophies and his average brawler level is around 4-5
---
Your boy grown up, and become a badass cactus
---
The season restart
---
Nope somebody got 62 with Robo Boss. This aint it chief 
---
i dont see how you still have such low level brawlers and spent $20. you should really watch a tutorial(i suggest kairostimes)
---
Where do you see your chances ?
---
Time to go out and make friends
---
I'm jealous 
---
Yep season reset makes you lose half of your trophies above 500. So a 1000 brawler would automatically be down to 750. 
---
I agree. Not many more have the survivability. Definitely needs a balance change
---
I‚Äôm sure they are busy with bug fixes and UI changes like you said. It‚Äôs fun to poke fun at the devs regardless.
---
Those stats seem to never change.
---
Rare brawler chance still shows 2-3% when you have all of them
---
I know. I even know how to hit the second box for double. I just played another where I was with a piper. We were in 2v2. The 14 power cube guy right next to piper got any at 13 health. 13 health out of thousands. This literally happened right after my last comment. Again and again it happens. 
---
Ok man hope you‚Äôll get it back soon, have fun üëç
---
I hope this means that you like it :D
---
Yea but i made it with affection 
---
It‚Äôs just about making the moves in the right time not just pushing like you just to, happened to me but it‚Äôs possible 500+ lvl1
---
what world do u live in?
---
Wren culture have reached supercell

Ya Frank has already been nerfed. I think he's pretty balanced at the moment.

Hello, I would like you to make a few comments, as well as these tips for TEAM DEVELOPERS!
---
1) For the development team of skins, not harturit, but to do fine.
---
2) Also for developers of skins - try to make a simple but high-quality (how it turns out from me).
---
3) For developers, game schedules - make smaller drawing bushes.
---
4) For developers, programmers - make a normal sulfur please, and then a lot of people crave for lags in the game because of the servers.
---
That's all! I wish you good luck!
---
TEAM DEVELOPERS!
---
IF YOU WANT THAT I HAVE SKINED IN YOUR COMMENT BY YOUR RECORDING YOUR SKINS THAT YOU RESPOND TO THIS COMMENT: LET'S GO!
---
I had not thought of that, thank you, man.
---
I remember when I was playing solo and there were still 8 brawlers left and then I found a team of 7 in the middle and they raped me. Fun times
---
The Empire Strikes Back. 
---
Do you mean ‚Äòpushing like you‚Äôre used to‚Äô*
---
What happened to you? 
---
Is he sweating or crying
---
Bruh I have virgin media business internet at 350 download speed and 1 ms too and I am lagging a lot 
---
Yea. Like 5-6 seconds of invulnerability to kill or run away. Maybe a little bit less.
---
oh
---
Ah yeah, that was the kind of data I was looking for.  The gold helps to level up current guys for sure and the power points are nice but they might be distributed to brawlers you don't care for as much.  If you have 12 brawlers and they get them evenly thats like 40 some each (I know it won't happen that way).
---
In any case, yeah from a maxing perspective you're going to get them all eventually, but its hard to say I'm going to play this game in a year or two.  I might, but who knows.
---
Especially as you start a new account and get the level up one time purchase options it might be worth it to snag a epic brawler or higher if you have the gems vs token doublers.
---
Exactly, "little" (referring to quantity, not size), not "a little". As in "There's little time" (Hay poco tiempo/No hay mucho tiempo) or "I have little to do these days" (Tengo poco/No tengo mucho que hacer estos d√≠as). Another example "Now vemos muy poco" (We see each other very little/seldomly).
---
I think just adding "Un" to the name would be fine (Un Poco de Amor, 'a little bit of love', which focus on the existence of some love). Or just Poco Amor (meaning 'little/not much love', which focus on the lack of love)
---
The connection to music is plausible, as well.
---
10 ! Limited edition skins and seasonal skins are a fantastic way to renew a brawler model.
---
Here are some ideas I have for special events :
---
Valentine‚Äôs Day :
---
- Cupibo : Bo dressed as the angel of love for Valentine‚Äôs day. Give Bo some love !
---
- Bride Piper : Piper found love and get married in a beautiful white dress with a bouquet of flowers as a sniper.
---
Spring :
---
- Gardener Mike : sun is back and Dynamike is out in the garden, ready to throw some explosive tomatoes !
---
Easter :
---
- Chocolate Spike : Spike became an Easter egg and has some chocolate eggs in his pockets.
---
Summer :
---
- Hawaii Barley : Barley puts on his Hawaii shirt and his flower necklace, time to taste some cocktails !
---
Halloween :
---
- Tara Mummy
---
- Death Metal Poco : Let‚Äôs get ready to hand bang for Halloween with Poco going on a high speed guitar solo !
---
- Ghost Leon : Leon wears a white sheet like kids and is going to haunt some dude out 
---
U talking bout me?
---
(Bull, El Prime main btw)?
---
Suggestion of u/OneTrickBoMain
---
I feel bad for the poco
---
Fix teamming! or make something like Life Leech in solo showdown permanent.
---
No worries 
---
i got spike with 0.0867
---
spoiler
---
You notice the change around 300 when players kinda know the game mechanics better and Leon can be counter by many supers or strategies. 
---
I'm sharing with you my art for the contest, what do you think?

---
how play mortis
---
1 month without Brawler and my mini account (1100 trophies) 3 weeks already
---
So mortis is only for stealing and preying on the weak i guess
---
lmao ofc not. kids just writing this bullshit and believe it is true 
---
yep.
---
Ok, now this is epic
---
Remove autoaim at 300 trophies. It's not fun that you can't win with mortis vs bull or shelly
---
i want this too!!!!!
---
crow?
---
You or me if u you should join my friends club Almighty Befall he is looking for people to join and you may be able to find some friends to play with there, also I play with the leader sometimes so we may team up if u do decide to join
---
Heyy thats prety cool
---
Makes zero sense to include him in the game, 100% will never happen.
---
Yeah cuz purposely bad drawings are H I L A R I O U S and that joke has never been made before
---
I wonder how that is coded. My guess would be that instead of checking that the whole title is caps they are checking if the title contains any lower case letters. Seems like a relatively good solution, but they missed some edge cases obviously.   
---
Hello dear developers, I came up with a new character myself from Russia, I have 6000 trophies, 3 more other accounts of which are 2400, 2000, 1500, in short, it doesn‚Äôt matter how I can show you this character, unfortunately I don‚Äôt know how to implement it, so I only have the characteristics. Do you have Instagram, well, like one developer, so I dropped the characteristics, here is my Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/abiy_shamilov/, over there are all the characteristics of the two characters.
---
i was considering crow but i just unlocked him and pushed to 450 with ease but if i had to give him a buff i probably increase his damage by 20 thanks for commenting though
---
Fck this Bull players
---
Post this on r/brawlrecruit
---
Or edit the video from the photos app like you would a normal video.
---
Ok
---
Leon is like Perseus from God of War 2
---
barrelbot = barrelbot
---
Tf? You don't even have a valid argument anymore calling me a stud. You just lost faggot.
---
To make Brawl Stars the best game ever you should add a League/Ranked mode, with divisi√≥n like Wood, Silver, Gold, Platinum, etc... like in other games.
---
This make the game more competitive and fun to play.
---
I think that the Leon balance change needs to be really well planned because if not it could kill the brawler.
---
now, repentance 
---
r/brawlrecruit not here please
---
True...
---
But I still want him.
---
"Incrible!" - Shelly 
---
Yea no way you're doing that with Primo, maybe with Leon
---
&gt;Gem Grab
---
wait, no showdown ?
---
Got rekt by peeps in the 600s by the 4th game and the 2nd leon decided to quit. He was at 1k trophies
---
That's actually pretty good matchmaking, your even trophy count, and that's how it is decided
---
[The original brawler concept art](https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/9x4904/misc_the_original_brawlers_concepts/?st=JQWPAASE&amp;sh=60e44e98)  shows him as a girl.
---
Pushing almost all your brawlers above 500 trophies in one month on a new account, I DON‚ÄôT THINK SO!üòÇ
---
ummmm whats the issue here?
---
I‚Äôve been playing since june 2017 and was one of the first primos to reach 500 trophies. Don‚Äôt think it can be too hard
---
As far as I know, unlocking the star power takes them to pow 10
---
I'm lvl 16 with 333 trophies. I've been struggling climbing with him in the tank/bush meta. And his mechanics are kinda wonky...once someone gets close enough to you it's super difficult to hit them.
---
U r right boi
---
I'm picturing it as Primo holding it
---
#FFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUNNNNNNNN
---
Nope not even an epic
---
Well Get a new friend lmao
---
2 of these 3 need a  buff
---
Eh.. Just play solo showdown then
---
I‚Äôd say to keep at a safe distance from tanks but to be at a range to do efficient damage. For snipers just sneak up on them. Otherwise i think he is quite strong so it won‚Äôt be too hard to push. 
---
Nice absolutely, makes sense. Gonna give a few different comps a go and see what happens. 
---
is this loss
---
Spike be like "Eeeeeeeel Primoooooooo" 
---
play her on grassy maps. when in close combat with another brawler, spam your super button even if you dont have it as it shoots your basic attack instead. this charges her super up and you‚Äôll immediately fire your super when its up. this is why shelly wins against brawlers such as primo and bull because they have to be close to her to deal damage
---
bo takes so much skill in showdown /s
---
yeah, my friend‚Äôs list slowly increased from adding randoms in game
---
Leon is OP sorry buddy
---
how can I register?
---
Yeah, but isn't the only way to get it is by power points and then you have to unlock it by random chance through a chest? Or is there some other way to get star power? I would love you have his SP! 
---
Google Play games.
---
Also in this game mode you can't heal, so it become much more harder to play. Or you can choose between heal and no heal modes. I think it's pretty cool idea
---
yeah, but initially only played solo. slowly made online friends in game tho which made climbing easier as you can pick proper comps
---
True. I remember I when I got Poco and I read his desc. Still remember it, lol... though I'm curious about pam and jessie's description... 
---
It's not a tie, the one who died first is second
---
wow fully maxed out thats insane!
---
thank you!
---
Lmao that's me
---
Nah. It's obviously Crow.
---
Spike disagree
---
I have lucky patcher, but I can't remove the play store license checking... It doesn't work with Brawl Stars
---
maybe i got lucky but i climbed crow from 300+ to 400+ in 1 session and then to 500 in another
---
Yeah I had same thing I ended up with the win 
---
Weird flex but ok
---
Thats what i was asking , like live tracker for your pulls .. 
---
Just because you cant see the beauty of the first fan art?! It should be on Supercell\`s HQ wall. 
---
Hold on I have un idea.... There was a file with town an houses and stuff and you gave me the perfect idea... Thx man I will try to make something and I will say that map idea was yours.
---
It's all about learning how to use them to max on their strengths. Crow is strong you just aren't using him properly 
---
Your bio is exactly me
---
I think it's more balanced than my version
---
definitely
---
(took me way too long to spell that)
---
exactly where my poco skins at?
---
XC5KM8L
---
Quick question, do you need the star power to level up to power level 10?
---
Is this a 90s rajini meme lmao I‚Äôve never seen that before
---
The chances of getting paired with a player playing the same brawler is pretty rare.
---
Teaming up with a duo partner means you'll communicate and in doing so your chances of beating randoms is quite high. Doing so by playing the same character (like using two Leons) would be pretty overpowered. 
---
If this was allowed most duo or trio teams would all just run the same brawler and it would lead to being a stale game. 
---
I'm sure you can imagine some insane teams like 3 dynamikes etc.
---
My wish would be that there was some kind of reward box that there wasn't a daily limit to..... maybe it would be like a star player box, kill box, some kind of rewards that were not limited. I always find that once I have hit my token limit and have won all the star keys, there is almost no point in playing the game ( other than trophies )..... My suggestion would be to have a separate reward all together, maybe something that goes on your profile or cosmetics that you can outfit your brawler ( glasses, hats, boots, ect ) ... Idk
---
me too
---
Man Bear Pig
---
Looks awesome üëåüèª
---
0.1776 no legendaries
---
Special move ? You mean ultimate ? 
---
I have two friends who played the game and they both got bo when he was a epic, first it got super rare and now he is a trophy road character
---
No hat , disappointed 
---
if there were any
---
My leg chance went from 0.11 to 0.06 after unlocking leon
---
I like how the legendaries are all one word
---
That's a very good Leon in the background
---
If they are in my clan then they can join? That‚Äôs why they are in. Plus you don‚Äôt have to post it, it is just an option so hosting events is easier. I just want to make my clan more active and I do that by hosting friendly tournaments, but it is just difficult with the way things are right now

I saw a guy that did 14s

We haven't seen a Richochet yet...I suppose that it's because we are playing Brawl Ball 
---
Hi guys, I¬¥m Ale. Today in my free time I decided to make a new brawler that I personally think it is very interesting and unique. As you can see in the picture, his main weapon are the boomerangs, if you like this post, later I will tell you how is the attack, super, and star power, also I have designed a skin for him, inspired in the Executioner from Clash Royale (similar to Barley, with his Wizard Barley skin). Thats all for now, I never draw, so... sorry if the drawing is not the best. Tell me what you think...
---
Yes I‚Äôd say I have more trouble with Rico due to the fact that I always use him like Colt n rarely use walls to my advantage because it‚Äôs unpredictable when pressured 
---
tell me the secret haha
---
Oh no... I just told my friend about brawl stars...
---
That's what I was talking about before. Good job mate!!
---
Every device has the same visible area. Larger screens got these greyed out borders to make the visible area the same as all other devices. The borders were greyed out, but you couldn‚Äôt see power up boxes or brawlers in them to make it fair. 
---
I had 3 bars but switched to my LTE and it was the same with 4 bars
---
So is she lucky to have you too?
---
I honestly hope that they do
---
One of my friends got Mortis and he got to the game at global release
---
It took like 6month for me to get Mortis...
---
Frank the Tank!!
---
*sigh*
---
I honestly really agree with this. Some could say that Mortis when Brawl Stars initially came out was the most broken, but with the length Leon has gone, I'm pretty sure Leon holds a slightly higher ground than the initial Mortis did.
---

Good Luck !
---
I'm tired of posts about matchmaking like these, and so is the rest of the community. Please stop.
---
Bounce shots, and get out of the line of fire, you can't afford to be hit. Literally he can cause so much problems when he can hit bulls cutting you off around corners, and use it to hit chip people and get your super and melt some people.
---
and I literally just got Leon from a free Brawl box. oh the irony
---
Sir, this is a Christian subreddit.
---
I mean how will any brawler except for the yanks counter him? From 4 tiles away he does around 500-600 damage and the first shot 100% itting all 4 and the next two ig you‚Äôll hit 4, so in all you‚Äôre hitting 8 shots, 500 each. Around 4000 damage and my numbers are all over the place so yeah hes over powered and bottom line he needs to get nerfed :)
---
it would have to vary due to brawler health
---
Which box?
---
But the potential is definitely there 
---
A fellow office fan spotted 
---
One of your the son of one of your parent's siblings is now currently present.
---
Mhmmm I guess I might use him in the wrong maps . He is very feeble unfortunately. 
---
Healer Barley?
---
Can't agree more
---
Tho, chats r fine imo 
---
Level 10 Bo is really good
---
Mostly Solo and gem grab ü§£
---
I must confess that I betray every time to teach them a lesson
---
Barley had too many rounds.
---
How is the second guys body invisible in the second video
---
She prepared for bird box üòÄ finally!!
---
Honestly I just avoid confrontations with him and get boxes and steal kills but I prefer colt
---
Does cr have broken cards? Yup
---
Do they fix them? Yup
---
Will bs team do the same? Yup
---
No he takes a  lot of skill and thats why he isnt that high...
---
Last update is of december 20, don't have big changes. About device, he can run good, I play games who are more heavier than Brawl Stars, isn't a gpu problem, it's a connection problem. Much lags for a mobile game who I play with a good wifi.
