Get spike, I bought Sandy and today got Leon! now 3/4 legendary , and mythic is more ez to get
---
Yes
---
It‚Äôs actually pretty easy
---
I did and I get it bruh
---
Thanks!
---
Funny , i like it
---
Daum i actually understood that
---
It only feels good to you. Imagine someone spinning on you for no reason after you die and lose 7 trophies. It‚Äôs immoral and immature.
---
Leon‚Äôs long range damage is bad. It‚Äôs only used for chip damage. To stop people from healing, and if they‚Äôre low, it‚Äôs to get a kill. And for Rosa, she has a faster movement speed except for Darryl, bull, frank, el primo, Bibi, sandy, max, mortis, Leon, and crow. She catches you slacking because she can catch up to you and punch you to death.

Also some kids dumb comment shouldn‚Äôt stop you. Some people will be mature and will like your art. Don‚Äôt let anyone stop you. Ik you‚Äôve heard this before a million times, but it‚Äôs true. Nobody can stop you except for you. My advice is similar to millions of other people, just take it from a random guy on reddit. One comment won‚Äôt hurt you. Keep on going!

What does stfu means? I'm weak at eng slang
---
Endorphones arent half as strong in a fucking game? Where is your source on that? Never heard such bullshit in my life before.
---
I'm not dumb to understand that 'they say it in their Terms of service'. I am criticizing that, nothing else. There is a definitive line between accepting something and criticizing it. It's called freedom of speech. You don't get any of my points. You try to disprove my arguments with anecdotal viewpoints and never even reply to my arguments directly. I wonder if you even read the articles i linked.
---
You are a disgusting human being, thats all. You defend gambling in a game that is rated for children. You're fine with children being introduced at an early age to addictive behaviour. And then saying 'Oh the odds are given, if you don't like it then dont play it' doesnt mean a single shit. I don't care what the odds are, it is and is going to be gambling no matter what. Nobody really has an idea how dangerous gambling can be. Everyone glorifies it as something fun and harmless, but the reality is rather horrifying.
---
Gambling is addictive just like drugs. There is a reason why casinos only allow adult people and drugs are not allowed for underage people. Get this in your head. I am not talking about myself, Im talking about the millions of children playing this game. 
---
You know what, im tired of replying you fking troll. Fuck off and have a nice christmas or whatever is left of it. Make sure not to spend your pocket money on slot machines though

Yes the "Made with Mematic" scares me too

When you find a team with üîé, you can't communicate using the chat, only with built-in sentences and emotes. You can also suggest brawler (and game mode, if you aren't team leader). But you can't suggest star power. Imagine a situation, when you want to play Brawl Ball with random team and you get a Nita with Hyper Bear and Shelly with Band-Aid (and they both have both star powers for brawlers they're using right now), and you really want to make them use their other star powers, because they are better. So you can suggest them star powers.

# FAQ
---
## What does this mean?
---
The amount of karma (points) on your post and Reddit account has decreased by one.
---
## Why did you do this?
---
There are several reasons I may deem a post to be unworthy of positive or neutral karma. These include, but are not limited to:
---
* Rudeness towards other Redditors,
---
* Spreading incorrect information,
---
* Sarcasm not correctly flagged with a `/s`.
---
## Am I banned from the Reddit?
---
No - not yet. But you should refrain from making posts like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.
---
## I don't believe my post deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?
---
Sure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.
---
## How can I prevent this from happening in the future?
---
Accept the downvote and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on Reddit.com. I will continue to issue downvotes until you improve your conduct. Remember: Reddit is privilege, not a right.
---
Congrats
---
Is that good?
---
Lmao, the adjective ‚Äúdisgusting ‚Äú is a bit much for a brawl stars screenshot. Don‚Äôt you think?

It‚Äôs not actually high effort as far as I know (correct me if I am wrong). I believe that he fused 3 existing meme templates and made a comic out of it. I gotta admit it‚Äôs pretty hilarious though.

BrawlStarsES would recommend that they place the daily missions, and that is that the daily missions would make the players play more than they usually do, and obviously receiving rewards to motivate the players to continue playing, exclusive boxes that call everyone's attention would be indeed, very well in the game, and it would be more fun to play BRAWL STARS day by day than it already is, daily missions would be very useful to receive some help. Things that could be placed in the daily missions, are "SPECIAL MISSION", in which the reward to get would last longer than normal rewards, this could come out on important dates such as Christmas, Halloween, the Anniversary of Brawl Stars, etc. What you could ask to accomplish a mission could be: In atrapagemas, a game with 7 gems ends, get 7 siege screws, score 2 goals in brawl ball, end a starfighter game with 5 stars, kill 4 brawlers in showdown (solo), in showdown (duo) wins first place twice in a row, etc. This would be the idea about the daily missions, I know that if the idea is introduced in the game, they will fix some things and add other things, what I know is that they will introduce it, since this would be a support for us, the players of this very good game ...

Hmmm, this isn't your place either it seems, you should probably go to school and learn how to spell properly before criticizing others, and it seems like you're the one talking smack through (did you just see how to type through?) the internet, if you're just going (did you just see how to type going?) to talk smack, get out.

I have like 23k gold I cant spend on anything. I am just waiting for 2 more brawlers. Took me 1year and 5 months without spending gems on skins. So you cant say supercell ain't generous. 5 years in clash of clan and still miles away from being maxed

Poco goes hobo

Alright I meant they where in the car not the driver because if they where the driver then they would be classified as the species ‚ÄúBrain Cells equal to my amount of palm hairs‚Äù. Also sometimes internet stops working and that‚Äôs ok, they stopped playing after the internet stopped working. And with the solos thing- I hate 2 of those so I probably shouldn‚Äôt give advice that I wouldn‚Äôt use and wouldn‚Äôt find fun so play whatever you want. I‚Äôm just saying you don‚Äôt understand ones situation and why they are afk so just try to give them the benefit of the doubt.

When he charges for a special attack he could spins around knocking back people in range

No it didnt, mortis is a kind of vampire, now shut up lol

Lukie probably was mad at that darryl for the rest of the week then

Ok let's consider it for a second. How many times do you think people have actually DCed from a car crash? I mean let's be real here. I have been giving them the benefit of the doubt for almost 3 years now and it's starting to wear thin. That's right, I'm a day 1 player, and it sucks to see a great game go to shit just because people cant just put the game down when they realize the playing conditions arent right.

I'm takedown, you have to be on the side getting those free popping gems around 10+ and try to walk on the side til you get to the boss. If you use high damage brawler then you need to shoot 5-6 times to be rank 1-4
---
Haha nice art

#GAME NOT OVER
---
I like how he just change your mom to your parents and think it's offensive lmao
---
Or inventory in Minecraft
---
There are very few reasons to use it over magnum special tbh, unless you're in takedown or bossfight. That or you're used to Slick boots more. It's a good star power, just reaaally outshined.
---
8 bit, he would be very slow but has high damage, control over the field very heavy also so low jumps.
---
B - POWER BOOSTER: drops a turret that lasts 10 seconds boosting speed and attack and decreasing weight of team in a radius. 
---
&lt;&gt; B - EXTRA LIFE: for a short period of time about 5 seconds 8 bit can't die but will take damage and if he is in a death situation he respawns without losing a stock.
---
/\ B - JETPACK: 8 bit has a jetpack come slowly out of his back and then he starts rising till the fuel goes out then he must land to use it again.
---
\/ B - ROBO ALLY: 8 bit has a mini version of himself come out of his face, during this time he can't move and when it finishes a CPU controlled 8 bit moved around but it deals less damage, moves quicker and only has normal attacks. Can have a maximum of 2 at once each having 10hp.
---
A - every single one is a quick burst fire of lasers and you can point it in a direction while shooting to change angle slightly.
---
Final smash - LASER CUTTER: 8 bit summons a second gun and both guns start a long firing, high damage laser during which goes in a straight line across the field that can be changed in angle. During this 8 bit can't move and all summons from 8 bit are fully depleted (he can't use jetpack afterwards or any robo allies or turrets and if any already exist disappear immediately.)
---
The description says collect power cubes tho
---
Point of view just sucks tbh, many community map are bad too including passage, eye of the storm, rocky blocks and more. Supercell maps are the best

It would make it even more rng dependent than it is now. It would just flip the advantage to the respawner. The only way they can save this mode is making a kill a kill. Remove the bounty system. It‚Äôs a joke.

What do you mean count the default skin it's literally the normal model it's not a skin

Greatest thing I've ever heard

Because there is a chance that he will be available later. The tweet says this:
---
&gt;FREE Classic Ricochet skin is here! üéÅ
---
It'll only be available for one week, so go claim it now!üéÑ
---
It seems more like the free offer is only for this week, and then it‚Äôll be available later. Not the skin itself only being available for a week. Reading through every comment on that tweet, it seems more like the offer ends in a week, not the skin.

The description was updated around the same time that they started referring to it as ‚Äúbattle royale‚Äù this all happened when they were getting so many complaints about teaming. No other game that has any battle royale type game allows teaming, only this one.  Other games ban players for doing the same thing, but weirdly supercell doesn‚Äôt have any report system to report anything that players are doing. Which further helps with the bullshit that goes on I side the game. 
---
And the matchmaking is not fine, we all know that the matchmaking system is based ONLY on brawler trophies. This a huge part of the problem because brawler trophies is no reflection of player skill, you can just put the time in and get 650. Better reflection of skill is overall trophies, which is no included, but at the same the main focus in the new system. So we know it‚Äôs possible, and that shows that they know it‚Äôs a better reflection, but we are stuck with the same shit. 
---
And another point about brawler trophies is that you can enter a match with a 650 brawler and then be matched with a player with 60 trophies. Because they don‚Äôt care if you bring your low level friend into matches that are based on brawler trophies. I suggested that they make it so that if you want to play with your low level friends that you have to form a full 3 man team, and with the new matchmaking it is entirely possible. But instead we get nothing at all done to the matchmaking. Tons of people complain about these things and nothing was done about it. 
---
I made tons of post and made tons of suggestions for solutions, along with others that I saw from other players, and yet nothing was done. If they were looking for suggestions there have been plenty posted here, yet the matchmaking system wasn‚Äôt even touched.

I had to buy the colt skin too, cause it looks damn good, but still the first one i wanted was the poco skin, i mean there are already good colt skins, but poco just has the serenade poco skin, which is lovely but it‚Äòs not like the pirate skin which is a rebel, he is like ‚Äûfuck the system, the system wants you to play guitar on a guitar, i play guitar on a fucking broom‚Äú

Then the whole team rush to get kill but die

No when we get gems it's pure joy nothing else when we get a brawler we run around screaming go up to a 1k player and scream at them because we just got pam then see them with every legendary and mythic and break every device you have

A team is good when you want to play 1 game mode. I switch game modes and brawlers about every other match. The time it would take to make a team island play this way is crazy. 
---
Better to fix the bullshit shitty matchmaking instead of making a new one, while forgetting about the current. The way this one is hasn‚Äôt been touched in almost a year. It was changed then so players don‚Äôt take advantage and rack up trophies. So instead they changed it to match you with the higher level, which fucks over the minority of players, the highest level players, because the current pool system I will always be matched with the lowest in the pool. So I see shot teams more than most. And most people see it a lot.
---
To be honest I had full 200 tokens and a token doubler when double token reward came out....
---
Can you make for Colt too?
---
Happened to me in POWERPLAY
---
Im not an english speaker so dont mind it. Well ü§î, what to improve ü§î. First the draw and the lines, make it bigger, if you make a small drawing, its hard to make details, make an better definition and copy the brawler more exactly, I mean, erase some parts when its necesary. Then the color, mix color inside the drawing, dont use just one for each part, this kind of painting need more than one kind of color, also use more black and white, dark and light, you cant make an 3D effect without it, another advice is inside the drawing dont use lines to pull apart, check my profile, in my drawing there is no any separating lines, the differents color pulls apart the diferents parts of the body. I dont know what else to advice ü§î I will tell you if I know something more

Why D:

But remodeled
---
Not sarcastic enough, didn't laugh . You have failed at making a random person on the internet laugh. Wow , you must feel horrible about yourself
---
I think the main attack should stun the enemy for a fraction of a second to make his attack different from Frank's one, of course he wouldn't have a fast reload speed

Wow! Congrats!

---
2 of Bulls shells
---
Reason I - No any skill required for both
---
Reason II - I havent seen a player who likes them... I mean i dont mind them stay in game but i dont know a player whose favourite game modes are lone star or takedown.
---
Reason III - As the other dude said, lone star is kill stealing which is annoying and takedown is like kill the other players not the boss which is also annoying they're all about luck not skill
---
Reason IV - Present Plunder is much better than them
---
It looks terrifying
---
Good boy, you have gained +1 points in intelligence.

LMFAO. Her shots are fast as hell

 Plus it's not like he's in another speed league entirely, just a bit faster. Only bull, super max, Rico, Bibi, etc could probably do that. Plus one shot and crows dead. Alot of times crow's backed in and just screwed.

Nita as polar bear, panda. Frank as iron golem

Hey. Didn‚Äôt mean any offense: I do the exact same thing.

You are fucking stupid,when piper remodel everyone makes this shit,and now you are smart. No.

Yes! All the SD maps looks likes same, and now the brawloween maps are the best now, I hated Eye of the Storm and Cavern Churn, but niw I love them, because the other SD maps are shittys (and supercell did it with Bounty and Heist, they removed all of goid maps)

How many quickies
---
Colt is actually very good in bb, he counters tanks (which are common in there) with high dps. He can also break walls with his super which is very important.
---
If that was possible then there is no point of even having skins.
---
Bibi is so much faster though.

Gene but how bibi can fast defeat robot?
---
YES THIS IS AMAZING
---
6k is actually very early in the game now. I got my first mythic at the old 5k which would be equivalent to 7k now.
---
So it shifts the problem from *"I should had saved all 200 tokens for the event"* to *"I should had spent all 200 tokens early on so I can get extra 200"*
---
I don't think a lot of players will think like this but I like your fresh perspective üòÅ
---
I did a calculation, in the former case if the player is missing out, they are missing out 400 tokens in total. While in the later case, they only missing out 200 tokens üßê
---
Lmao

Wtf are you trying to say? first learn how memes are supposed to be

Hope you know they match you up with bots until ~150 trophies.
---
Exactly! Doing this would cut the brawler meta down even more to just colt and bull, and make the mode worse than it already is. I only play it for the token when I have 9/10 otherwise I just leave lone star and takedown alone cause they suck.

Same situation can be seen on Jessie too. She has black eyebrows on her PP and Brawlers Page but has red eyebrows at menu.

Well, it depends; but I'd rather to buy token doublers or tickets which make me progress faster than having a skin which is helpless referring to progress. But yes, it's also really cool to have another skin for your favorite brawlers.

12k trophies, f2p, 6 months, 2 brawlers with star powers, 0 friends, 1 legendary, 2 mythics, most brawlers at level 7 or 8, some at 6, 26/32 brawlers, push about 2k a month.
---
What?!? I want 2
---
Carl, road rage carl
---
I got 10k in 10 months
---
I try to play power play just to test my skill. And yeah I play almost every time with randoms
---
who tf is bruce?
---
Lol, in italy she's called maxine, and I prefer it to be honest
---
Uhm, its a common name...
---
Your "bad" cut make it even funnier
---
Perfection
---
Invisiheal actually does +1000hp per second
---
I still think leon is best lol
---
I now want mortis even more and if I dont get him by next decade I will hang myself
---
I said Bruce hits but yeah
---
I feel ali-I--I-iiivveee!
---
Granted, now Leon is back to when he was released
---
I legit thought of making that if this post got popular lol. Good karma for you though. &lt;3
---
Mah man spitting straight facts!!
---
I believe its anita's bear.
---
I have and it is still fun. It makes the game dynamic :^)
---
Darryl, pam, and crow remodel are in progress (and small improvements for jessie and penny).
---
Once they‚Äôre done will introduce to the game.
---
Teaming be F U N
---
Yes.
---
Yay I‚Äôm hoping the crow remodel would make it to the game
---
30x8.......240, yes, 250+ ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
Is a name...
---
He was good before the nerfs imo, where his Star Power was solid
---
Same thing happened to me! Out of a regular box too!
---
Yeah, I don‚Äôt know why they like legendaries to be regular brawlers, they‚Äôre supposed to be legendary right?
---
Ok but can u explain why i can't post anything in discord?
---
Bruh I just opened the 4 mega boxes no brawlers or star powers and I haven‚Äôt had a new brawler since October.
---
Highest trophies brawler I have is Colt at 930 and then second highest is bull at 650. So, I think this is normal!!
---
This comment was made by a russian boy
---
not at all the 2 bots
---
This is the final concept of the Chill Staff Brawl Christmas projects. The final 2 posts will be on the last days of December showcasing the concepts as a review.
---
Just reversed
---
I think crow will take more time, bcs they‚Äôre gonna remodel crow and white crow skin, and change his voice too.
---
Not pointed at you
---
Al fin encuentro a uno jajajaja
---
Al fin encuentro uno jajajaja

I (H)ATE THEM

Name ain't random is improper grammar. Ain't is "am not" so its incorrect. Good idea otnerwise!

#*MINECART KEEPS MORE WAGONS BEHIND*
---
He is an enemy of the senate
---
not sure which one. juat watch the last few
---
you will find it
---
Do you mean r/okbrawlerretard
---
Sorry but, I don't see the problem...
---
I'll admit that he didn't do crap at beggining, but in the end he played like a normal person...
---
Maybe he had work to do, or something like that...
---
On the Rocks!
---
And why would they do that just for a simple skin?
---
PRESEMT PLUNDER IS MY LEAST FAVORITE PLS NO
---
Thank goodness
---
Yeah that makes sense but it‚Äôll be better I think. Yeah when they remodel white crow I‚Äôll get it right away
---
No no no nononononono
---
How is this consider a news ?!!
---
bro she is easy to get, you will get her eventually, you are complaining about not having penny while people at 14k+ trophies don't have a single legendary, go to the shop click on big box then click on the "i" to see your chances of getting every rarity
---
Yup never happening to me
---
I havent got a f ing brawler in like 2 months
---
Made by yusufreddit
---
Ur just not used to playing with skill as bea takes a lot of skill to use.
---
i got bea and sandy in the same box, still cant belive it
---
The baby hippo is callen Fiona
---
4¬Ω
---
Don‚Äôt post this stuff, no one cares that u pulled an EPIC.
---
no one said ots for just one skin tho??? i meam they could also put some other stuff in like knuckles rosa or whatever
---
I would block you too. I don't see what the problem is. Why do you even play randoms if you're going to complain to Supercell afterwards
---
watch bentimms video with Dani
---
When you pushed every brawlers to power 9, open a box an there's 1 item remaining
---
thx
---
Heist? Lonestar?
---
Bea was a bad girl.
---
Agreed, never thought of this before.
---
But but you can lose more trophyes as well
---
Darryls not even top 5 for lonestar ( roll to short) and heist is a good option but currently I dont have 1 single teammate that's gotten further in a push then me
---
What is rong
---
dude it‚Äôs like absolute dog shit in terms of rate of fire and damage compared to say rico or penny etc
---
Darrico? Like I mean I respect ships but like, dude.. wtf..
---
foing
---
The user ment that the brawl stars maps are chaotic while in clash of calns is just season
---
.
---
mano, isso aqui √© um subreddit em INGL√äS
---
lol
---
I thought he would do well in lonestar since he is an assassin bu guess im wrong
---
aNd thiS mY brOThEr gEOrGe
---
I like it :)
---
Bruh it's a name. It hasn't stolen anything from that shitty game
---
Brawl stars maps:chaotic
---
Clash of Clans:just season nothing else
---
it's good in the right hands and the only reason your bad with it is because your shit at he game
---
Chubby darryl
---
And piper cant have children with ricocchet.
---
Robot x human? Meh
---
hey if people make p of a human girl and a bandot robot i can ship a sentient barrel with a gumball machine that ye√±ls death threats
---
Nobody gives a shit
---
You don‚Äôt see what the problem is?! It‚Äôs right in front of you mate... I can understand this matchmaking for teaming up pre game. But it‚Äôs not fair in the slightest to go up against a full team of power 10 with randoms when I‚Äôm the only power 10 in my team and have over 500 trophies.
---
#buenas noches
---
That‚Äôs not bad, why do people like u complain? It won‚Äôt help anything at all.
---
The worst suggestion I have read so far.Removing the only proper game mode for a Capture the Flag knock off?Even worse, bringing back the so called Life Leech as a modifier, the mode that Frank said played the least?Are you trying to kill the game?
---
There goes the report
---
Get Rick rolled
---
Karde≈üim ben yazdƒ±m ona
---
If you good with Brock, Piper and Penny then you‚Äôre going enjoy playing with Bea. It‚Äôs all about aiming and not missing your second shot bcs the damage will increase 3x times.
---
wow assuming the gender of the game ‚Äúhe game‚Äù
---
Terrible offer anyway
---
Also it‚Äôs not very professional and customer service like to block a player that has spent real money on THEIR game for asking a simple question!
---
It looks nice tbh
---
oh i didn‚Äôt realize the damage increased that‚Äôs probs why i‚Äôm not doing dmg
---
Lol 17k , all brawlers a lot of power 9/10 #R02PCQY
---
GO FOR THE HEAD
---
Not symmetrical
---
Bea handed Rosa the wrong fertilizer.
---
Is lenny Penny‚Äôs turret?
---
U just changed his colors '-'
---
i just saw the notif of someone saying g*y robots (it got deleted instantly so just in case im censoring it im very sorry) and i gotta say: the portal fandom already did that this aint nothing new
---
Man, they don't make brawlers overnight. It takes time.
---
Imo poco x piper is kinda trash no offense
---
Yah
---
Why is this so downvoted? He raised a valid point?
---
Why lower damage???? Not even necessary.
---
And chose the right map for her, not all maps suitable for long ranged brawlers.
---
you suck
---
to make up for the huge range buff.
---
Pessoal n√£o entende q BR aqui deve ser tipo 0,5%
---
Wow how long did this take ?
---
You can love White Crow. We are just talking about it being overpriced. It is only a recolor and it costs 80 gems. There is nothing wrong with loving White Crow. It is just a bit overpriced.
---
Kind of agree, but is canon
---
I don‚Äôt know why, but if you check the Canadian Leaderboards, LukieBear is there, ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø 
---
I don‚Äôt know if he is Canadian or not ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
I think he is ok as he is.
---
this was litterally me at 10k but leon instead of spike
---
Proof
---
It does if your dynamike
---
5-10 minutes
---
Pose and palette is literally in the top picture, which is from the game...
---
...what is a bruce...
---
Adorable art!
---
he is underwhelming atleast in higher ranks.
---
Great idea it needs to be seen
---
That‚Äôs not fast.
---
NO DELETE THIS CACTUS IMMEDIETLY *shooting noises*
---
I push him to 800 every season no problem
---
I think you're just bad. She deals 3080 DMG in close. She's a fucking monster.
---
Piper is ricochet's girlfriend I'm sad now
---
I think is something related to an old brawl stars add, but also if you play Piper and Rico in the same team in the Darryl ship environment, a garland will appear at the top
---
I thought it would be 1 star power and 1 brawler but that's luck gone wrong
---
Ok. Just so you know she‚Äôs called max in english (end so most of the world)
---
Ohhh
---
C'est marrant √ßa
---
Yeah, I have an appointment next month
---
Her weird cosplayer sister also deserves a husbando tho
---
Why not 11?
---
He didnt mentioned it, did he ? If yes tell me the time :)
---
I legit clicked the X thinking I was in game
---
I don't think it is removed. It is a great map.
---
It's my fastest not yours.
---
Its to the update be longer
---
A solid 7.5 out of 10
---
Ok thanks
---
Yeah but if I play showdown and take a break, my box amount could be 92/100 and remaining tokens 200/200.
---
I'd have to play to get it even again and then wait for it to go back up to 200
---
Nice yeet
---
No I'm not talking about piper and rico I'm talking about poco x piper, I already know piper x rico is canon and before you say anything I'll just address that I do NOT ship it, I repeat, I do NOT.
---
Yes it is
---
Is this some sort of lucky joke that i am too unlucky too understand?
---
Well your not wrong hes good but at like at 800 or so other assassins out class him like mortis with coiled snake and leon
---
I want a hug these dynamikes keep running away from me
---
Supercell: No I don‚Äôt think I will
---
No bad idea the game will be microtras
---
the best combo currently is pam, 8bit, jessie... colt is good too
---
Whoops my bad just looked like what best fits for Poco idk
---
Repost
---
I got 3 brawlers yesterday LOL
---
Thank you kind person.
---
Piper look old for poco though, she sound like shes 30
---
Today I opened her too, but 4 days ago I opened Leon...
---
Y E S
---
it doesn't go over the wall. can't you see that the wall can only see the underside and not the top. So it looks like it's going over the wall, but it's actually going over the wall
---
B
---
Poco is #LITERALLY DEAD
---
ü§î hmmm noice
---
Bea: Stop hitting me UwU
---
Rosa: I know you like my thorny gloves
---
Yes. Probably canon lore
---
Bea sucks. 
---
Doesn't do nearly enough damage to off set her low health and slow rate of fire. The only beas I've seen do well so far. Were in game modes were you can just sit in Bush all day. Waiting for someone injured and low on ammo to come by. So you can hit them with two shots and a super point blank.
---
C
---
Being dead doesnt mean your old, maybe he died at a young age, he looks like hes a teen (18 or 19)
---
8Bit is nothing
---
No, he made one of his older skin ideas again.
---
I will not use your cursed comic lol
---
Slash and dash, his opinion is trash
---
I just got Leon 4 days ago but I like trolling people that I'm flashing my Super and go to a bush but I don't really use it and just stay there and watch the enemy shooting everywhere to find me...
---
R34 looking art
---
Thanks; first meme
---
Agreed the 1st day I got her, I managed to push her to rank 24
---
This almost happened to me 4 days ago, but I had 2 boxes and the second one gave me Leon.
---
Watch your mouth. You kiss your mother with that mouth?
---
Why does anyone care?
---
I think Shadow Night Jessie hit puperty. It's a pain for Pam but she manages it
---
Yup MAX is a girl
---
Save up 300 power points now
---
If they did for Rico then they can for dynaüò≠üò≠
---
Quick maths
---
Well I was missing for Spike, Sandy and Crow for about 4-5 months...
---
I agree
---
happy cake day.
---
eBay has some plans.
---
What?
---
G R E A T 
---
 S C O T T
---
Ok then, how do you propose that they improve it?
---
1 month for this? A dog could do a better job in 20min
---
i kind of wanted to make it cursed
---
I can
---
Drives me nuts that this doesn‚Äôt help charge his super again. That is all.
---
Ok....
---
The first picture really irritates me
---
yes
---
I dont Get it *sad noises*
---
&gt;
---
What could Supercell do about It?
---
Oh... I just noticed that
---
r/BrawlStars in a nutshell
---
Well, yeah, they should really buff me because Bulls and Shellys are my worst enemies besides the walls... But to say it out loud, I'm USABLE even if I don't have Star power, because in lots of cases SKILL is more important than STRENGTH. But I agree that my reload speed is trash and charging my Super for example in Solo showdown can be hard. So, I appreciate your work, hope these stats one day will become true and then I can continue to take the teamer souls.  
---
Good night fellow creatures of night!
---
Triple
---
Then it's shocky...
---
I downvoted your post because you shook the camera. We get it. That was cool. Had you not shaken the camera, I would have upvoted this because it is actually a pretty cool post.
---
Da moon is mare of cheese~
---
Don't be a Alman
---
On the old account I didn't had but on the new one yes
---
I got bea four days ago and I got Leon today
---
But how??
---
Hahahhahahü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ i get iiiiiiitttt. Da helth of da box is 666 wihch is teh smae as da devil nimber. OMG waht an orignal joke yuo are funnist person in da world
---
Nice!
---
Ahh, the good old times when Shelly's Band aid was OP...but the showdowns were terror.
---
This looks and sounds amazing
---
Thought it was always penny but ok
---
Nope. Graveyard Shift isn't playable anymore. The game has changed.
---
Great art
---
i'm sorry then ;-;
---
When you use Carl's Super to kill teamers be like:
---
,,I used the spin to destroy the spin!"
---
I kinda bought Shocky...
---
Pls stop
---
THE WAR TO END ALL WARS
---
firstly it's called present plunder secondly if you can't do well in the attack then stay in your base to defend and let your teammates do the job while you are defending your team's present, brawlers like emz, spike, 8bit and jessie are great for defence
---
Amazing
---
Who cares what brawlers you do or don't have. The community as a whole loves the new mode. It's temporary, and will be gone in less than a month according to plans. Why should they change something that so many people like?
---
Make morw
---
Look i started to play in the day of global realease
---
i only spend money for the cyber week offer and i have 7 star power and me to 1-legendary spike
