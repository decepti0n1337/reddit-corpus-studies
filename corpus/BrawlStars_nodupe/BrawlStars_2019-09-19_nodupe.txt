That's okay, he will be happy with his old friends now

I‚Äôm kinda the opposite. Have 2/4 l√©gendaires. But no mythics

Or mabye it shows what place your in and how far you are from the next person

Woow

No, I have never teamed as dynamike...

I don't care about the self scoring issue...just my opinion...  I had to do it to stop a pointless match a few times. If you deny having done this action before this then you are not being honest.
---
I have seen other people on my team do it , because we all knew the other team was going to for sure win...if you deny this statement then you really don't know and your not being honest with yourself.
---
When I say pointless ....two teammates literally standing there not helping at all....then one comes to life and walks down the map opposite of where the game is happening. 
---
Self scored...game over ...done...next game try again , do your best.
---
I had an issue with it  happening a month or so ago but it was only 2 times it ever happened honestly...maybe 5 times since I played this game overall.
---
It's not really an issue especially at higher trophies range...more pro players looking for good competition there.
---
But just to reiterate this is only my opinion.
---
My friend do and he got trophies most of the time

Nada que un traductor no pueda manejar. De todos modos, la raz√≥n de la parte es porque la mayor√≠a del idioma utilizado est√° en ingl√©s, por lo que s√≥lo tendr√≠a sentido comunicarse en √©l. De lo contrario, la gente no te entender√° a ti ni a los dem√°s que hablen espa√±ol.
---
This idea makes zero sense. You can only charge super by hitting enemies. Hitting enemies reveals enemies. So what in hells name is the entire point of being able to see an enemy after you've already hit them. You clearly didn't think this through.
---
Never won against him though, i never play the best brawler therr woth the best star powrr. And bow they are using op sandy while i dont have it. So no victory but fights only
---
That is not a face of boredom. That is a face of a man that has seen death and the horrors of combat.
---
Sorry.
---
I think when I played it as a showdown it was better
---
The most band aid should've been nerfed is like 3000hp recovery. They nerfed it way to hard and now it's hardly even useful.

The report system is not a must. It's just going to create extra hassles ( for them not us the gamers).

No good will come from a report system, it's a waste of there time that they could invest in making us new and improved content in the upcoming future of this games lifespan.

I opened over 1000 boxes and DIDNT EVEN GET piper I'm at 8k trophies let alone a legendary

Lol
---
That's right, I heard the story over and over again
---
On the flip side. I just opened 174 boxes on my mini and got nothing lmao. I need all legendaries and mythics and few other lower brawlers. This game is so random it‚Äôs funny sometimes.

---
Yep
---
4-5 at a time, 5 was the most supers I managed to put down before the other super expires at training. The stupidly ridiculous thing is the range of it. 
---
With the starpower sandy would be the most annoying brawler to fight against but fighting him one on one seems quite easy since his main attack damage is quite low compared to the other legendaries.

Yes, although she is a brawler that is accessible to everyone.  I mentioned her in an earlier post, if you would like to see.

I suggested something similar to this yesterday. My idea was if supercell wants to be bare minimum info for this gamemode at least give us who is in front of us with their score and whos behind us with there score. This way we have a target to beat and one to stay a head of. I do like this idea better though.
---
Golden Barley have a new bottle animation and cost 30 gems :p
---
You know it's a /r/Brawlstars meme when the title is shit
---
That map made me create new insults, credits to SUPERCELL.
---
2 of my mini acc opened like 400+ boxes and didn't get him. Luckily, my main unlocked sandy with only 30+ boxes
---
Maybe Ryan?
---
How about the Eye of Storm?
---
Supercell could do this for Bounty as well, but it is more useful here.
---
This can be helpful because if you had a lot of stars but still lost a lot of trophies, you can see how much stars people who ranked higher than you had.
---
You can get legendaries from normal boxes???
---
Well technically the Legendary chances did increase because the chance increase(when you unlock all brawlers of a certain rarity) now appears
---
[removed]
---
i don‚Äô understand why
---
Because I don't play shelly, she's down with all the other brawlers I don't play with
---
Amazing art
---
Dont start saving boxes until you have every brawler trust me youll thank me later when you pull a sweet legendary. Btw i have every brawler including sandyüòá
---
I still get 1# as Piper 540+ trophies, the spawnkill is hard to accept...
---
I think the nerf was needed but it was a wrong nerf.
---
Now the star is basically useless. He respaws with no ammo, when the shield is gone you still don‚Äôt have ammo, you can‚Äôt run because you are the slowest brawler in game... so you die twice.
---
I don‚Äôt know a better nerf, maybe remove the shield idk. But this killed the star power. Remembering that it‚Äôs just once per game.
---
ikr, for two updates he was glorious for the first time in months then supercell decided to nerf him twice, they must hate music
---
Would would be the logic of saving boxes for your purpose?
---
Thats why i never use primo in sd
---
I spawn camped the whole freaking game and no one spawned next to my corner lmao
---
If Penny won't give Daryll a voice chip then we should start a war on r/pennygang
---
Nothing this dude got mad he lost
---
How about if an own goal happens, you have until  the round starts for your teammates to vote if you should get a red card (Special on screen vote button). It has to be unanimous, if it is the player is frozen from playing for rest of the game.
---
You essentially will be playing 2v3 so you would vote if you really believe the own goal was on purpose and the player wont help you win. If it‚Äôs a unanimous vote for someone who accidentally did an own goal, you guarantee yourself a tougher game which is counterproductive, thus you shouldn‚Äôt have voted.
---
That can work.
---
Photoshop?
---
It would be even better if you put that ink thing on ground.
---
 saving up untill theres a new brawler with a better rarity that I can get
---
&gt;	Does this mean the BS engine uses a 16 bit engine?
---
No, it just means that they stored the brawler's health value in a 16-bit integer.
---
Thx makes a lot of sense
---
Sorry, i haven't seen a picture of this before. Thank you still :)

I know I just feel he lost his gimp ability. More of just an indifference now rather than an attack that finishes the job.

Of course you can. I got all mine from normal ones and all three times it was highly unexpected and very surprising.

This was obviously before the update

Very nice!!

Wait, that works? Isnt there like a limit to how long i can hold it?
---
That could actually make it much easier! At least in theory. I didnt know that! I thought the game wouldnt register an autoaim after holding it too long. Thanks man!
---
Ah s@#t,here we go again
---
Really?
---
Even after the update
---
Siege is just a bad mode that I‚Äôm sure most competitive players hate and wouldn‚Äôt want to play in tournaments.
---
The only 20 win challenge I ever played was the first one with probably the worst meta ever at the time but I still managed 17 wins. I play CR once a month at this point but I can still win grand challenges easily because there isn‚Äôt much skill to be gained or lost in the first place. 
---
All that CR comes down to having common knowledge of game physics, because there are zero aspects of aim, movement etc. All you gotta do is memorize the few key places to put cards down and you‚Äôre golden (which is why tournaments in CR are super back and forth, unless someone is against a hard counter) The only other thing a player needs to pay attention to is what the meta is (but that goes for every game ever)
---
Closest PC game to Brawl Stars is obviously league of legends, (which is one of the most competitive games to exist.) It‚Äôs what inspired the creation of Brawl Stars in the first place.
---
I‚Äôve had several league players tell me that Brawl just looks like a mobile cop out with a way lower skill gap, because in the long run that‚Äôs what it is. 
---
Either way, all Brawl Stars and Clash Royale come to is how much time you put in. Any casual player could EASILY make it to pro league within a month or two of practice. Whereas most competitive pc games can take years, or people just can‚Äôt learn games that complex
---
Amazing art, you should do more!
---
nice
---
The 3 Mortises and he has dynamike and piper for team mates so he‚Äôs gonna get destroyed

I don't see how Spike would be scary. There are Jack-o-Lanterns everywhere in Halloween. And how is Nita's one scary? It's just a doll. And how is Crow's one scary? We all have skeletons in our bodies. And besides, being scary makes it give more of the feel and I don't see how it would traumatize children. I am a child myself!

Ah hell naw

How does he have 1063 trophies if his highest trophy brawler has 36 trophies
---
She's not that bad because Bulls and Shelly's are everywhere. This is bad at first but the grass will disappear eventually. Then you can't sneak up and you are on an open field

This could be possible tho
---
No dude unlike you he has a life
---
Thank you dev team, especially for your update with correcting the rates of box rewards. I think the number now is a lot more accurate and it's great to know what my actual chances of getting a legendary brawler are. It was quite frustrating when the percentages for getting a Super Rare (for example)  was not 0% even when I had collected all of them. Thank you so much :)
---
He must evolve into his final form!
---
Would also like to see live position during the game

Result u all know

Every BS YT says that supercell is equalising both the star powers for equal power but I am seeing them to do this

Ability to chip someone from areal far away is powerful, as well as his super that he can pull a low hp brawler with a lot if stars and just enailate them. I literally pushed him from 470 to 560

Yeah. I wrote that

That‚Äôs right I heard the story

Yeah. This is bad though. I get that some people still want the skin but what's the point of buying it if everybody is gonna have it ?

I hope they change their minds and make new lunar brawl skins. We'll have to see what they're gonna do for the brawlidays skins.

You only get 200 tokens per day. You get 20 tokens every 2 hours and 24 minutes.

Why don‚Äôt you argue removing snake pirarie, cavern churn or feast or famine? Since it also has a lot of shotgunners and bo. At least this map has a zone for others.

I don't think every Supercell game needs clan wars. That's the number one complaint people have about Ubisoft games, that all their games are open world with towers to climb and meaningless collectibles.

Do clubs need something to make them worthwhile? Yes, but hopefully not just a copy paste of what CoC, CR and Rush Wars is doing.

What would you suggest they do?

Yeah lolüòÇüëå all I wanted that bec iam an OB player and I wanted them to give us those skins as a thanks for our support like fortnite and season 1 skins you knoe
---
yeah hi there, I'm one of those campers, I find it hilarious 2 shotting a rico as bull in half a second leaving them confused. so I can tell you out of my multiple games doing this, it's not a winning strategy, you usually only get atmost 3 people you manage to kill and a lot of the times you get killed urself by a 3rd party member lol. so tho it may seem like their getting easy bounty kills in reality there not, it's just for the lols.

Then what else balance changes are you looking forward to?

This is the best post ever.

Thank you

Can you please don't?

I don't know man, 12 seconds are an eternity not only for the invisibility. Think to the enemies inside a maxed out Sandy's super, with his first star power, they cannot regenerate their hp for 12 seconds and furthermore they'll receive 200 damages per second...
---
I need Sandy
---
Why in the world will they nerf shelly are they out of their mind.First it‚Äôs nerfed to 2000 health but now 1800health are they crazy!?!
---
I agree this mode is so much fun but the map is just trash I don‚Äôt like how I can be bull a spawn camp someone that‚Äôs not far and everyone just stays in the bushes that makes it‚Äôs hard to find people.

Agree. Many youtubers think he is good because they maxed him at day 1.
---
Sandy isn‚Äôt really OP at all his reload speed is decently slow so his DPS ain‚Äôt that high and its a wave attack sure but its very narrow and only has slightly more range then Poco. His Super isn‚Äôt as powerful as Leon in any way as it only being in a limited area greatly reduces its power making it much easier to scout out.

good idea

he more needs like a better animation.

So was showdown
---
Hope you are not one of those people who play the wrong brawlers on the wrong map in 3v3 just because they like the brawler
---
Worst brawler in the game now?
---
No when your brawlers are all received they will change to 0 but when they release a new brawler the brawler for the rarity will be back for example if a new legendary is released it your legend rate will return to 2.4

He looks like shaggy

 You have nothing intelligent or even interesting to write to me so save us both the time by just getting the last word here so you can move on in your life.
---
It seems like you need closure so go ahead and send your last message in attempt to redeem yourself ( it will never happen) and just go on about your wonderful day thinking that you gave me a piece of your mind. Maybe tell a friend or family member about it. So you can put your little mind to ease today. 
---
Maybe when your done writing your last little message you will have achieved something today.

Which is wasting people's time with your useless rambling.

Have a good day.

That is why its called LONE star

oh haha get good haha you're so smart about misspelling a three letter word. most prepubescent shit comment I've ever seen

I don't need a remodel for crow,just an animation change 
---
The way he walks is meh
---
Greetings.

Me too haha

Can someone explain me why he bounced on "nothing"  and went through a wall? I've not played BS for quite a long time, maybe something changed...
---
Your draw style looks like my draw style (a little bit), but i never can draw like this ;-;
---
I guess you guys are the ones to always use Shelly

Kinda too OP in my opinion. I think instead of  a full Super it should be half a Super

Yes but you're 4 days late

how did you boost the quality on this it's so amazing :D

Lol. Yeah... Sometimes it is like that... But give it another try on todays map... This map isn't good for Bull though... Better a mid/long range brawler. I loved it with Carl, Penny, Bo, Brock, etc.

It'll probably be one of those skins that will get projectile animations later on.... like Beach Brock and Summer Jessie

Showdown isnt competitive. Being counters by a deck in cr is soo common, countered by a brawler is impossible. Soft countered isnt even common. Mortis counters dyna, but its very very possible to win, theres much more that goes into it.
---
New
---
She obviously is...
---
&gt;Get Mortis
---
That's where the problem begins
---
What
---
I had 10100 when unlocked Gene but I think the best brawlers are Mortis and Carl. I like Mortis from the moment I had 3000 trophies(got tara at 900 and Mortis at 1200) and Carl since his release. I am good Mortis and Carl player. Now I have ~10700 trophies
---
Opening 200 boxes gives you about a 50% of getting him. Opening 400 boxes gives you about a 75% of getting him (in fact more because the probability will increase with every box you open).

If there was a 6 instead of 3 that would have been the best post ever lmao

leon special offer cost 349 gems, otherwise when u think that will come?

It was his feature, like Shelly spamming ults. Now he is bad. They should better fix Shelly‚Äôs super, it‚Äôs op

Not an argument.  It's a shelly bull fest and a pain in my ass.

Camp? It makes no sense to camp in this game mode. It‚Äôs hard to win without actively searching for targets.

Yes it is a haven for shotgunners no doubt, same as cavern and feast. Winners in those maps are usually close ranged. I still do not see the exclusive hate for invasion.

Following a primo whole match with crow and decrease his hp to 100 and boom what happened?  A bull steal yar kill and ya wanna run away? Hell naw cause a goddamn shelly is waiting for ya with super and there is a leon who chase ya the whole friking match and ya can't do any thing cause your keep getting shot by a piper out of nowhere. So can ya kill some one in this situation?
---
What, no, why. Literally nothing innovative
---
Same feels man
---
I liked to camp in the spots where people have to walk to cross if they wanted to hide in bushes... Its the small spot between every big patch of Bush... It works well
---
Dont diss mah child
---
Yo my dude. I'm at 17k and no legendary as well and have the exact same legendary chance.
---
I made a bit of math, I hope it will help you.
---
For a 20% chance of pulling a legendary, you need to open 134 boxes
---
For a 50% chance of pulling a legendary, you need to open 417 boxes
---
For a 80% chance of pulling a legendary, you need to open 968 boxes
---
Right now I'm saving my gems instead of buying skins so I can buy a discounted legendary later. I'm at 300 right now so in 2 months I will be able to buy one.

don't give up

Yes I want this and I know it's called LONE but screw it

Well crow is burst damage so ya also I hope u know some characters are just not fit like a bull in open map and in this case a mode where what defines ur victory is dmg and range
---
what you think about it does it need any changes?

Ermm... Let bull stay there in the corner... He's a bad boy.

what the fricc have you bring up on this cursed land

Yey, thanks!

Different teams work on different games yall
---
Spike seems to be ok with anything! Have you seen his loss animation? Spike don't give no cares!
---
I do like his new skin
---
More like ginger family
---
It doesn't matter the map that be open or not. When yar the only player who is not shelly or bull of course you keep getting killed by a bull while running away from shelly. And i won't be like those guys who keep playing Shelly and bull in every single map and think that spawn killing is strategy or something.
---
True bro
---
Not bad
---
he's in an opposite gang, he doesn't have a leather jacket but a jeans jacket which if i'm not wrong was trending in 2010s?
---
You can also do spawn camping
---
Then hes prob playing low trophies or got super lucky
---
It shows the suggestion for the remodel. :)
---
Spike is good.
---
To all these kids saying that this map is full of shelly if that is the case then you can also play shelly
---
not confirmed but i support that tbh
---
tho i think bo being father of nita and leon is more possible than that
---
Wait u talking about the trash map or the mode in general if u talking about the trash map ya u should only use shelly or bull lol
---
Damn I was gona buy it before the update and now I have to pay more gems lol
---
But where is leon? Did he use his super?
---
oh lmao
---
there's a gem next to blue barleys robe
---
Thanks bro^^
---
1) colt is not a junker
---
2) bull is in the gang with the cool jackets like bibi and crow (not brock he has a different jacket)
---
We need update every week for brawl stars
---
It might not make sense to camp but people are still doing it. You ever play showdown and have a person who refuses to stop fighting even though it's obvious the winner will get killed? These people just want kills they don't care if the finish 9th at least it's not 10th.
---
Nope
---
Just... don‚Äôt take them?
---
Why Colt is junker?
---
I don't know how made this template so i can credit them if anyone can tell me that would be niceüåöüôÇ
---
After that Leon killed spike and sold spikes dead body and sandy bought it and made spike into her slippers in her skin
---
And it seems to work? :)
---
&gt; After bearing the meat, not bearing
---
u wot m8
---
xDüòÇ

This is actually really good.

It would be a nice addition to nita's family

It didn't crashed, but I saw a guy that appened, I don't know why
---
Very cool!
---
They looked horrendous imo.
---
i started in 1995. do you even brawl stars bro? 2016 , that's some rookie shit bro. im rocking the 1995 OG dynamike skin that looks like a gold digger from the 1850s. Do you even gokd dig bro
---
bro üòéüí™
---
ik that saving boxes when you are not maxed is dumb, thats why i was asking the op not you, you should have replied to the post and not to my comment. do you know how reddit works ?
---
I don't want to sound rude but, maybe the attacks could be canonballs?
---
They come in the shop when the season ends, not when an update drops.
---
It'll be on your shop on the 23rd.
---
I played quite some games of Lone Stars, and i get what you're saying. But i have to disagree with you. Kill stealing is part of the gamemode. You have to do everything to get stars. Such as in showdown, when you have to so everything to survive. The other gamemodes also have these goals, that you have to do everything to achive. The brawler specified maps are can be true, but are not a problem. The other gamemodes have maps that are also really brawler specified. (And the Lone Stars maps are old Showdown maps.)
---
That is amazing I love it
---
Cannonballs out of a f*cking lamp
---
See you in hot m8

I would give all epics and all mythics (except for mortis) for one f\*\*\*ing legendary

yes I thought about it but I was too lazy to edit hehe ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

I will take 200 power cubes if game dont crash

The point is...he got it, you said he didn't need it, talked all that shit and now look. I called it how I saw it and you didn't see it you just got on my post with your game reference put downs.
---
This was a " in your face"

And you still deny deny deny

Los efort post
---
Sure but if you like them, it feels a bit like you are missing out. It seems easy to grant some small effect on self.
---
Pam heals herself with her star power, whilst Gene doesn't. 
---
It would seem easy to grant 50 hp a second to gene himself thanks to his star power.
---
i think spike having no voice is part of his charm
---
Ah, high school.  The peak of tiredness.

*copyright infringement intensifies*

How‚Äôs it a kill if they‚Äôre only doing 75% damage instead of killing?

5k with no legend is normal but 14k is a different story -_-
---
Yeah i know but its not as flashy as the starpoint skins for crow and bo and so on.
---
Dude nice work the super looks like supercell themselves made it!!! Good job
---
Just three words: fuck outta here
---
Honestly. They're not that good. The only one that I'd  actually use is Leon
---
Aw damn i wanted to write beating the meat. Sorry
---
cool
---
Eh, yea
---
Maybe he was turned by Tara into a cactus.
---
git gut
---
I got leon on 6k, its okay
---
Lol. 30% quite a bit different than 100% buff. Your idea was OP, as evidenced by the fact that he didn‚Äôt get the 100% buff.
---
And I still think he didn‚Äôt need it. But I guess now you might finally be able to push your crow to 500 with the rest of us ;)
---
Colt isn't Pam son, He is Bulls younger Brother
---
Now im 8k
---
Up in ya mum's gooch socket
---
doesnt work like this, since your chance goes up with every box opened ;)
---
Autocorrect
---
I will never see primo the same again
---
Coin doublers are more time-effective than tickets. The most you can put on a single ticketed event is 30 at a time, if I remember well. Coin doublers just gets you more tokens for the same play time.
---
They're also more effective than mega boxes, because you spread your chances at bonuses, so you have a better chance to get anything vs nothing.
---
Now that is spain ass
---
Thanks broüòé
---
Nope i get more
---
Best idea i saw at least this month!
---
True 10000 percent
---
This is so fuckin' cool. Best skin idea EVER
---
I love it! Nice effort dude
---
And second star power?
---
Why would you out yourself as a teamer?
---
Hi, what's up? :)
---
We need more ticket events, since robo rumble is only once a month now we should have more options then just boss fight and big brawler to
---
WAIT colt is a junker

Good job de idea Is very good

Oh wow,how u guys do that omg üí•‚ù§

if I didnt have crow I would be at 15.6k he is my only leg and is at 500

Well tbh ur proficiency with a brawler is much more important though sure some have map advantage... hope ur not one of those people who calls people out on reddit when ur actually an average player :p pretty sure I‚Äôd have u on toast u whatever the map was ;)
---
Why whAt
---
Omg love it
---
Lol congratulations, nobody cares
---
Always when you're fighting someone and you both have low health, a 3rd guy comes and kills you both, it's so frustrating
---
Yeah lol
---
The developers giving gender to a pack of pixels is not relevant.

But I just checked on google and indeed sandy is a unisex name so I guess I was wrong.

Welcome to the crow gang
---
Where is she or it was just a reference
---
Ticketed events reward tokens outside of the daily tokens you can earn. Robo Rumble rewards tokens based on how long you survive and the event has the best consistent ticket to token ratio. It's fairly easy to get 25 tokens per ticket and it's not that hard to consistently get 30 tokens per ticket so max bets of 20 tickets usually yield around 5-6 boxes worth. Token doublers also apply so it allows you to rack boxes very quickly if you have a lot of token doublers.
---
You played with Darryl and I played with Mortis in Shelly's invasion
---
POCO GOES LOCOOOO
---
O per il like, volendo
---
Shellys Band aid has been nerfed to oblivion and her first star power doesn't make a big difference compared to the brawlers I gave as example.
---
As for Piper, her first star power still takes her 2 shots to kill most of the brawlers, so no changes here, and snappy sniping has been also nerfed to oblivion.
---
So OP, don't upgrade shelly or piper.
---
Jessie is poor tho
---
I opened boxes to get Sandy and got band aid
---
Best skin

Rip man

cause you were playing with bots

17k without a single legendary my dude. Sorry to burst your bubble.

This is only a month animation suggestion, not related to star powers but to the skin

that‚Äôs impossible, perhaps the archives are incomplete

Love the whole design but if they add this into the game, the price will probably increase for the skin because it isn‚Äôt just a custom model for the brawler D:

Why couldn't they say something? They could of said, "please don't say that, it's offensive to me, thanks"

I like this idea. I‚Äôm coming up on 10000 so would be nice to know that my efforts are more rewarded for playing the game so much and I feel this would really incentivize climbing in trophies for a lot of people.

As of now it says he is Vice President of Catcus Bandits and has 17,135 trophies

Wellllll technically..... Disney owns cinematic marvel movies (only including characters they didn‚Äôt sell off to other companies), and Disney owns Fox, which owns Deadpool. So yes, marvel Cinematic can use Deadpool, they don‚Äôt own him.

it is indeed skill based but the maps are the problem like why should we start lone star with island invasion that is filled with bulls and shellys

This is wonderful and I wish I could buy this for $15.99 plus tax at my local gamestop

i did... **and i never use him again after**

What?

WOW MEN

That is the logo that crow's jacket has. Maybe its just a logo or a brawler who was Crows partner or gang leader

Band Icon. Or on the left, a tongue.

Darryl, I've come to bargain

You‚Äôre hired

add bushes they are important in this mode to hide with the 10 gems :)

**bruh is he teaming ?**

i have seen more teamers in my life thats not a dyna mike

Right... op...hmm he's a support brawler his job is to heal he has such a terrible dps and at low power is the worst brawler in the game and is only used for heals and his half decent range
---
i would say buff it to 2500 not that low and not that high perfectly balanced

Low effort, also r/shittybrawlstars

What if it's made out of aluminium?

Better than me when you ask for a Bull damage nerf xdddd do you have 6k trophies or something?

Well that would make him an more expensive skin though

you gotta love when 5 year olds associate skill with having an og skin lol

I would agree if it weren't called "Starkampf" in my language, which just means "Star fight".

This ain't where these jokes should be.
---
I just don't get it.
---
We need originality.
---
Is Colt bald?
---
I wanna go cry in a corner.
---
9k trohpies and not a single legendary.
---
A hook but I agree
---
Ok first of all, Fox is right on how literally no one said Sandy is transgender, except you type of people who are making crap up by saying "The devs made a mistake by accident" so you can say Sandy is a female and get away with it.
---
Second, the developers giving gender to a character they made and stating who they are IS relevant. Bullshit logic by you. Notice how he's shirtless? And listen to his voice lmao. 
---
Third, I was gonna tell you to just shut up and simply google "Is sandy a gender-neutral name", but I'm happy you finally used those brain cells of yours.
---
In conclusion, Sandy is a male. I thought he was female at first and it would be cool is he was, but whatcha gonna do? I'm just going to enjoy this awesome update and see that Sandy is actually a pretty cool character.
---
How is penny as tall as jessie
---
I get that in the actual game she is, but W h a t .
---
umm... what about pam, bibi, bo, tick and rosa?
---
Congratulations on the 7 stars! You must have a writing style that I consider needs a reply :p
---
12k and I don't have Piper üòÇ
---
You guys are getting legendaries?
---
Looks cool but Disney would sue SC
---
Hmm I have a alt that I use whenever I‚Äôm raging and it its ‚Äústfu u ***‚Äù and the asterisks are the main three letters. It‚Äôs been fine so far.
---
I know, now let's wait (hoping in no 8yo spamming everywhere"wE wAnT bRaWl TaLk SuPeRcElL, iT's BeEn OnE mOnTh SiNcE lAsT oNe, PlZ nOw")
---
Then check the bush from afar
---
Wait how many do you have
---
I only have 1 mythic bralwer :(
---
Haha I love it! üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
We got pirate Gene in the GAME!
---
What ricochet
---
some one tile gaps need to be removed
---
??üòÇ
---
For poco I was mainly referring to his usability in takedown since he has an extremely low dps
---
Bounty and showdown are different things.
---
literally
---
unplayable
---
no
---
Congrats
---
It was my favorite
---
Sandy it's your stop
---
Oh no she can't hear us she's got SLEEP PODS on!
---
Me no understand
---
This is my first gif meme, any feedback?  You can also check out my other memes here -&gt;  [https://www.reddit.com/user/Mtang1217](https://www.reddit.com/user/Mtang1217)
---
Still good because tons of people play shelly/tanks. You can just sit in the mid and assist your tanks and destroy the bushes eventually making the map more open
---
i don't have the skin cause i got rico after his remodel but atleast i buyed el rudo that was worth every gem after remodel
---
It‚Äôs not power level dude, it‚Äôs trophies. That Jessie is at 600 total trophies and playing with a 70 trophy brawler. Us (the other teammates) are at 14 and 15k, and playing with some of our lowest brawlers (at over 500).
---
I'm sorry but why did u make this??? 
---
Not a lot of new players are in this sub
---
Silver fox
---
They‚Äôve revived since the raid is tomorrow
---
Some people just arent the brightest. I dont think OP is.
---
Too bad supercell is trolling me and has barely given me any points for 8-bit (currently power 2 lol)
---
Total trophies doesn‚Äôt matter‚Äîit‚Äôs the brawler count‚Äîmy poco and
---
I know
---
How long have you been playing for? I‚Äôve got everybody but Sandy and my chance is 0.3667, but I‚Äôve been playing since the early beta.
---
Yeah, that‚Äôs what I said. Look at the picture. We‚Äôre playing with a 70 trophy Jessie while we‚Äôre at over 500.
---
Same here, and while I dont think it needed another nerf it's still not useless.
---
wow bro, i want to know how you make this
---
Nita's bear could be a mythic!!!
---
Why
---
Barley wins in close fights against mortis
---
I was just saying that the Jessie was at 600 to show their skill level compared to mine. It‚Äôs not that hard to understand.
---
She is
---
Yeah I‚Äôm saying 550 isn‚Äôt that great anymore‚Äîeven at 750 trophies matchmaking is shitty
---
Are you even listening? SHE WAS AT 70 trophies. We were at 500... my god
---
Maybe father?
---
Oh
---
That jessie and Spike was in the same party
---
You want a cookie for that?
---
Snappy sniping is not good, its ass. Band aid is still useful though
---
Me? dude u have 1k trophies amazing.
---
I was in the party with the spike
---
LONE star is supposed to be only solo but takedown will be fun with dous
---
R u sure??? 
---
Cause the is no way that Jessie was matched with u or the matchmaking is bad
---
Yes, I was in a party with the spike
---
Or collecting 30 gems as a f2p
---
r/vredditdownloader
---
so? it‚Äôs rly low odds to pull a legendary, especially with only 143 boxes.
---
So if that happens to more than one person it‚Äôs no longer a glitch?
---
Woahhh this is amazing! They should make this a skin!
---
beach brock is pretty nice now
---
hey wait a minute...
---
the tribute to old el primo video was EZlose and he's always complaining that he dosent have anyone watching his vids
---
Then you must be from the future my friend 11/30/19 is two months away
---
I don‚Äôt doubt that it‚Äôs hard, but how often do they release new skins? Maybe a couple every few months. They really don‚Äôt have time to make attack animations? I‚Äôll give them the benefit of the doubt for now because they released 2 new game modes and a brawler. I just hope to see more new attack animations in the future.
---
He never opened up boxes. Early draws are predetermined. Poco is one of those draws
---
I don‚Äôt know but I also don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs possible. There‚Äôs a time limit and not very many chests. Unless you‚Äôre that good ü§îü§îü§î
---
Well it did crash afterwards
---
lies. u have all of them. checked ur account
---
c:
---
Do i smell a 
---
furry
---
She had too much sugar
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure the record was 156
---
Thx for clarification
---
I think  GÃ∂EÃ∂NÃ∂EÃ∂   everyone is looking at something else...
---
 I guess now
---
r/cursedimages
---
i can see this skin get a discount in halloween
---
Very well made. Stuff like this gives me a reason to search around this subreddit.
---
For his regular attack it should just be water
---
Now this is what I would call a *legendary* synergy lol
---
Great idea!
---
Why did you get downvoted tf.
---
You forgot to add the sheriff in the title. Colt is not confirmed to be part of the junker family.
---

---
JK, if that's what you believe then believe it. Still, amazing artwork!
---
\*Shows up with Zero ammo\*

\&gt;At level 10  
---
\&gt;fights bots  
---
"HE OP PLS NERF!!!"
---
I know o really shouldn‚Äôt be defending them but how would you like something completely random a attack animation takes about a month to perfect but I‚Äôm guessing they change their minds a lot. Also they want there work to be worth while. Keep in mind this team of attack animations had new brawlers attacks priority‚Äôs first. Skins second. So I estimate it takes about 3 months to get a full fledge attack and then they might dust it so it may not be worth it in their minds.

Kinemaster is an app
---
Spawn camping is one of the Lone Star strategies, learn to bush check or dont play lol
