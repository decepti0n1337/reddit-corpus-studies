The chance to get a legendary is the same with every chest. So you have 10 chests compared to 1 chest so your chance is higher

Usually the definition of an assassin is someone who attacks and kills with the enemy being unable to attack back. Mortis and Leon use speed and kills as fast as possible. It is next to impossible to hit a crow that is attacking you.

No im pretty sure the megabox is Your % x 10

Yes.

What about the fact that i never face a lag? even if i live in south east asia (location with worst server, confirmed by Frank) If you use a shitty connection, don't expect to play smoothly

Oof

Mhm
---
It's a good replay but i think you should put it to replay instead of strategy becauae you just show how you got 9 kills
---
Almost as if mech versions of things is a trend. Who knew?

bruh i saved up over 160 normal boxes, 17 big boxes, and 3 mega boxes (from trophy road rewards) and opened them all in one sitting. i didn’t get a SINGLE new brawler.
---
or probably tara's voice
---
Especially when they're the ones who caused it...
---
We had a bull who went to the other side of the map to use his super on the wall while we struggled on defence. When they scored, he started shooting at me, even though he wasn't helping on defence.
---
Later in the match we found out that he somehow missed the entire wall on the enemies' side.
---
Me and my friend like it.
---
It’s better to have comedy that some can appreciate than no comedy at all

Hey can you give me critique on my post :D also Piper is pinkrier ( :&lt;
---
?
---
what do ya mean i use it a lot and it's good!
---
Hmmm yes
---
The comments here are made out of comments
---
As a Piper main, I think Snappy Sniping’s reload should scale according the range that she hit her target. Something like from 0.2 ammo at minimum range and scales up to 0.5 ammo at maximum range. The scaling ammo reload would be maybe along the likes of 0.2, 0.25, 0.3, 0.35, 0.4, 0.45 and 0.5 according to how far she hit her target.
---
This would benefit the good Pipers. Plus, I think Piper’s uniqueness revolves around her damage that is directly proportional to her range so it would make sense if Snappy Sniping would follow her scaling damage like her main attack and Ambush star power.
---
10/10 buddy u clutching it up man your skill is good keep brawling

I was at 170 before

You yeeted you last haw ❌                          
---
You yeeted your last head✔
---
yeah i do, which is why i asked a question directly pertaining to this conversation.
---
I wanted too, but I’m not great at editing; I used iMovie while on the bus lol
---
Shooter bots : #I am speed
---
idk...... seems familiar........
---
Leon’s star power name should be sly chameleon. Pipers star power should be sent from above. Carl’s star power name should be mining manic. Good ideas for star powers tho
---
U just have to play good in all of yur games
---
Hmm, I guess that works.
---
I'm in Rogue Nation myself.
---
dont get me wrong im not accusing u of anything but this replay seems like i have seen a piper in this map getting 9 kills and the opponent brawlers were the same i think..... maybe someone else also did the same thing....idrk
---
The emoji police meme is DEAD. Still, emojis are cringe imao
---

---
Wish you luck, btw what’s 12 functions
---
3rd star powers are coming out already, they have been datamined, for example bull 3rd star power makes him immune to knock back, slows, and stuns. Carl 3rd star power makes his super break walls, and bibi 3rd star power makes her super slow for 3 seconds
---
My name is Tick. I am &lt;&lt;ERROR&gt;&gt; years old.
---
My ship is in northwest section of Brawltopia, where all the pirate brawlers are, and i am not married because i am a robot.
---
I work for Supercell as a brawler, and end my workshift at &lt;&lt;ERROR&gt;&gt;o'clock. I don't smoke, but i occasionally oil my self.
---
Coming from someone who loves Leon to bits and is pissed about the constant nerds, I agree
---
Idk if this is sarcasm or genuine
---
It is, when slowed out by Spike or Emz or Shelly, you turn blue and drop off blue down facing arrows, same with speed boosts as in this pic.
---
eciN
---
Its also 10$, they are both marked as 4X Value
---
So like a mirror attack?
---
Cause he just got a brawler and his legendary chances dropped
---
Well, im wrong. Thanks man!
---
It’s the least balanced thing ever.  It’s so incredibly bad in 3v3’s and pretty OP in SD.  It should be replaced.
---
Ok, one question. If you bet 1 ticket, does matchmaking put you with people who also betted 1 ticket or does it still match you with people of the same trophy range and ignores how many tickets you bet entirely?
---
Your shortenings are pure cringe.
---
Holy shit this entire comment section belongs in r/gatekeeping
---
It's ok
---
She's karen now
---
Mike is OP
---
IMO, aiming with Piper is way easier than aiming with Brock. I think for Lone Star moving too much attracts too much attention especially when you got a high bounty with low health.
---
It's not karma whoring, this is someone showing that they aren't a degenerate and we need more of people to show it

jesus... i just checked with my game and it’s true. how did you find this
---
It’s EMZ’s dungeon.
---
Nah. You were gifted
---
No.
---
I said this once more! Shelly right now has only one skin you can buy and by adding a new one we can offer a cool skin to the players that don't have star shelly.
---
Yes...maybe I like this a bit too much but I don't want this skin just for me or because I don't have the gems at the moment.
---
Nice diwali spike. Happy diwali to all Indians on brawl stars
---
"Yo how do I turn off creative"
---
Piper is actually good in the brawl ball map
---
I did the exact same thing with me 1k dynamike and got downvoted,people think i was just begging for upvotes when i was trying to spread kindness.Smh.If you wanna see,look at the comment section of my recent post where i give away in big game.It’s just sad that people can’t appreciate good deeds.
---
Honestly expected this to be something like Megamind: “Well here’s me falling to my death.” But there was no twist at the end.
---
Average pichu said:"I bought an offer too", answering to my comment
---
Aight. That’s believable then. Ggs. Nice work!
---
Rico nest incoming
---
Pls
---
No, Darryl will get one
---
some people wanted him silent
---
First of all nice skin
---
That’s not an editor. That’s a legit 3rd star that’s in the game files. They have 3rd star powers for about 10 brawlers.
---
Its actually in the game already. But they are unobtainable
---
Probably they meant "energy" but misspelled it
---
Why they change the animation? that was perfect!
---
Nope.  Even if you have over 14.5K cups, the trophy road bar won’t go past that mark.
---
Have no fear because now speed is his best star power because he dosen't have enough time to heal and his super is way better with the speed since it dosen't last as long anymore
---
Most of the time I complain about the enemy team being too good. It's like an angry compliment.
---
quick fire *cough cough*
---
Two Mortis in one team with a primo is almost as good as zero dps. F for the sad sods
---
I understand what you mean, but in terms of how well he does against other brawlers, Crow seems to counter a lot of the roster. I can see how he could have trouble with longer ranged brawlers like Piper and Rico like you mentioned, but anyone who doesn't deal significant damage over a far distance is usually outplayed by him. 
---
In terms of Frank, I would say he isn't completely useless, it's just that it seems like he can be the most overtaken by others. In Brawl Ball, he can either be a beast or a bug depending on the other team and the team  that he himself has. (I know his first Star Power can make or break matches, that's for sure). In other modes though, it seems like almost all of the brawlers are much better choices, leading me to say he would be the worst.
---
For Gene, yeah he could go higher. Personally I haven't had too much luck with him, but that's just my situation. My friend has been doing well with him, so he could be placed higher easily. That's just where I felt he might be in terms of how well I did with him.
---
I got 23 coins and 14 power points from a box.

I just want to point out: My “poopy head” comment was a joke. My “old enough” comment was a joke. Nobody in their right mind uses those phrases unironically. I have no clue why you’re so worked-up about what you think my maturity level is. And I assume you understood the “9-year-old” part, as you supposedly frequent PewDiePie’s subreddit. Quit being so fussy, stop throwing a fit, and move on with your regularly scheduled reddit browsing! This isn’t even an argument or a conversation, it’s nonsensical, unentertaining banter. So, please stop replying. Thank you :)

If no enemy has damage tick then it is random
---
Yeah. I saw your video on competitive with the double poco so I decided to go in with poco alone....immediately matched with another da capo poco. It was so dumb.
---
Were you the last one to injure that tick?
---
Odds: 0.09
---
Maybe she did that because Tick did a Self-Goal XD
---
Sakura spike

Lol i didn't expect people to find this  😂

Yeah, but that doesn’t consistently heal you. It’s no more broken in graveyard than it is in regular showdown.

Dude, if that's how you see games. i can't imagine any games that will appease you. Most games are somewhat p2w. Supercell isn't that p2w. There are a lot more p2w game. Not only that. p2w games that you neeed to buy the game. I can only imagine you playing offline games (but really boring and can't kill time) or playing minecraft, the greatest game ever in history.

Then why post it? I don’t give a fuck about karma, but many people do. Why would you post it. I doubt it made anyone “happy.” It’s literally a game. Compare it to someone video taping themselves giving money to a homeless person. You don’t need to tape it...
---
How is it supercell’s fault you brought mortis to brawl ball?

Do you think there would still be time to get all the available skins once this offer comes out?

How you label yourself is entirely up to you, and it sounds like functionally, you're asexual. What you are describing is not unheard of (go Google "attraction to a fictional character", there's lots of forum posts, including on asexual forums!), so understand that you are very much not alone.
---
However, you seem to desire intimacy, and aren't sure why you don't have attraction outside of media characters. If so, the good news is that attraction is a situation that can be fluid depending on how you change, how your circumstances change, etc. If it's okay to speculate: Your current attraction may be related to the ease of assuming a risk-free intimacy with imaginary persons. You "understand" them at a deeper level than most relationships, because their whole stories are laid out for you through the media you absorb; this makes them more "real" than the people you meet. At the same time, you have control over who they are by how you perceive their stories, and you can fill any gaps with admirable embellishments; this way, you build a perfect (even perfectly flawed) person and don't have to risk disappointment or rejection.
---
If this is the case (again, I don't want to assume!), then you may find opportunities for intimacy with people in real life. You may have to work on yourself first, though. The way you put it - "nobody in the world could satisfy you" - is why I bring this up. Right now, you can create perfect emotional relationships to your satisfaction, but a relationship with a real person (while opening new dimensions of relationship-building) would mean exposing yourself to risk, criticism, disappointment, etc. Being able to handle that risk is a really challenging thing, and if you feel like this might be descriptive of you, it could be helpful to get a counselor's help in reframing your approach to relationships.
---
But - you don't have to do or change anything if you are satisfied with how things are!

You probably shouldn’t claim to know what other people are thinking when you’re trying to argue a point. That gives the other person a really easy retort, but I’m not going to go for the low hanging fruit myself.
---
Also, try to mention which part of my reply you are referring to when criticizing them, or at least explain why your criticism is valid.
---
You said I had to perform mental gymnastics. If you had taken the time to explain in your post why what I said fits that definition, you would have realized yourself that your argument is misleading.

I said that neither frank himself nor his skin are available for purchase ( see the screenshot of my in-game shop windows above ). Supercell opted to change their store from always displaying every skin, to only ever displaying a few skins on a timer, because that encourages compulsive spending. The kind of compulsive spending that will get you to buy the bundle.
---
What you call “mental gymnastics” they call “business model”.
---
How many trophies do you have? Is Spike your first legendary?
---
Ikr theses youtuber are using this shitty strategy to get subs, and likes. Stupid ass kids will felt for this
---
Sweet
---
well it would normally switch to gem grab  when i do it
---
you are awsome
---
emz kinda thicc tho, not gonna lie
---
But the real question is, why would he threaten to get Nita when he's the superior Brawler?
---
U know that duplicate account names are a thing right?
---
For Spanish version, sure.
---
My bad, I didn't see.
---
Good news every one the white paint factory is back in business.
---
I forgot to delete the sound 😑😑
---
I can’t unsee that now, damnit
---
I make a happy face :)
---
IM THE CREATURE OF THE NIGHT
---
No!! He has 4! That of the Lunar event, the shooting sharks, rapper brock and that of retropolis. You know?
---
the game gives you all players with that name in a row
---
INTO THE FIRE
---
What?
---
Yea? Well i encountered teamers!
---
This game is already really generous in terms of F2P, I think this would be unnecessary.
---
How tf you can take out ike as a mortis
---
Going to play Toxic on purpose now to unlock exclusive skin
---
Sorry for makeing you feel bad but I don't see any teamers in graveyard shift
---
that would totally ruin the economy, and brawl stars would lose so much money.  gold is far more easier to get than gems, and no one would by gems anymore
---
thats the point ;)
---
Prove it
---
Nice! Now You've to build Scrappy lol
---
He is not, he’s my second. I got Sandy the first day he came out and I only saved up 8 boxes for him. I’m at 8500 trophies and I have all the other brawlers except Crow and Leon. I know I don’t have the right to complain, since some people are at 10k and don’t even have all the mythics, but I always wanted him. Even if he is hands down the worst legendary now.
---
Wow so many upvotes for a copy of Gene getting bullyied
---
why there is folder for ONLY brawl stars?
---
Apologies, it turns out you’re a troll. I’m guessing a youngling from your attempts to sound smarter than you clearly are If you have to dance around common sense so much. Now I just feel bad for you.
---
Ugh now you freaking hate me for having a bad opinion for a reason? YOU GREAT!
---
I KNOW THAT U DOWNVOTE ME FOR NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WELL I DONT CARE! AT LEAST I GET RIDE OF THE 599 CURSE!
---
BTW I CANT JUST PROVE IT WITH EITHER VID OR IMAGE BECAUSE IDK HOW! I VISIT THIS REDDIT ON PC!
---
AND YEA, "TEAMING",WELL PEOPLE ONLY ATTACK US!
---
Or bull. Shelly you’d have a higher chance to survive
---
You Are Talking About Beesniper
---
Accurate
---
It's a chipmunk, Chipper, from cats cafe comics :)
---
If you have max power points then you still get extra gold
---
Hol up
---
Doesn’t matter anyway, the video was uploaded Friday night
---
So until I max 8-bit as well, I am going to continue to get shit amounts of gold and shit amount of points towards 8-bit?
---
Your computer has a virus
---
Lmao,i got my first legendary at 8000 (Spike) I'm at 11000 now and i still don't have any mythics and my only legendary is Spike.F
---
Dude its better to spend them on roborumble
---
I've had 9 kill piper match
---
How did you do that lol?
---
So basically emz with a cap and a mask
---
AIN'T NOBODY BRINGING US DOWN DOWN DOWN DOWN DOWN DOWN
---
YOU ARE AWESOME!!!
---
Cool and also it will be cool if they ad this cuz making your own map in the game and allowing you to play it is cool
---
Bibi currently talks like a loli already.
---
I'd rather see competitive vaper emz honestly.
---
I hear something      FBI OPEN UP!!!!
---
u/nuclear_angel
---
i dont think youre going to apologise ever.
---
Yeah so cool
---
Yes but no hat is like the original. Is not a skin, you know?
---
Pennywise spike
---
Yeah! But i don't have tickets :C
---
Don't talk to me or my son ever again
---
What’re you complaining about?
---
New players be like
---
Can’t compare them if their stats and roles are completely different
---
About 3!!!! throwers in siege on 800+ trophies
---
YEET
---
Ok thats your fault, get a team
---
No don't the skin will go up to 80 gems
---
I didn't know there was a star box
---
Bad manners. If you BM you're basically an a-hole
---
I just lost 34 brain cells reading this
---
First time?
---
Yeye tell me shit about my fault bla bla, i bet you don’t have even 1 brawler at least at 700
---
That could be a star point skin!
---
See you in cold
---
So he's doing something unrealistic?
---
People use El Primo in takedown?
---
This is great 😀👍🏽
---
Why are there 10 missing comments on this post?
---
Damn that is so accurate! That’s awesome!!
---
I just got Sandy but I don't think it's all that strong
---
Bullshit? :)
---
How about giving some actual constructive criticism?
---
14 K man
---
AAAUUUUUUUU
---
Cuz come on......
---
I feel like it should be more like a zombie? Cauz she’s a zombie
---
As friends this could be better
---
I hate it bc fights can turn around quickly bc of dominant brawlers and bc brawlers cant be told apart at a first glance
---
69 mins...nice
---
Cupid Bo sounds awesome, but please, if you do female Bo, please, do not sexualize it. Please
---
Kinda-
---
I won on duo bc of that
---
ew.
---
N I C E   F O O T W O R K
---
Credit the artist thief!
---
She's going to beat you to death with her own hands.
---
I see only 3
---
Like Rosa or primo?
---
Yeah and then you could play the map with your party. Good post and edit op.
---
Ah yes good work!
---
lmao
---
It says 15 and I can only see three somehow
---
Reminds me of splatoon
---
It's a wild 8bit in his natural habitat...
---
3 years of practice and a weekend
---
When the Leon disappears.
---
Woah
---
Remindme! 1 week
---
Jessie Cosplay
---
Where do the kids get these "hacks"?
---
This would be awesome. Then they could bump the price to 80 and it would be stonks for me
---
Best game mode ever. I feel like takedown is too out of control with element of luck just a little too high to get constant wins. Played severall games but the concept of last hitting to get a kill is too hard to get the hang of. Graveyard shift adds a new level of skill and ever kill is absolutely rewarding so really refines my dodging patterns, wall fights and general movement around the map. Its crazy fun.
---
#She's a witch. SHE CAN DO ANYTHING
---
Found you in Hot, i was browsing for 2 hrs. Nice art!
---
My friend did this once and he unlocked crow at 5000
---
Stop asking for free items the money that p2w players use are used by supercell to pay there employes or team which brings and give updates to the game if everything is free there will be no money for sc to pay for there employes and teams and the game would be boring and stale if there are no new updates. So you kids better think properly before you post ideas for more free items
---
Replay?
---
What
---
Your post is so blessed that as soon as I hopped in I was the boss. Good vibes and wholesomeness all around ❤
---
Graveyard shift
---
10K and no legendary D:
---
I think it’s a bug me too
---
God my ears are in pain
---
Lol I wanted crow and so I bought the bundle when the mechas came out
---
Wait a sec isn't this piper's new skin ?
---
r/lootstars
---
And Its feels much bad when a random uses the wrong brawler and you got matched up with that randomsand worse you bet 20 tickets on it
---
Frank had a wife when he was alive, check one of the pictures in his house in the Mortis and Frank animation
---
this looks very exact, greatwork
---
😃well😊you😧see👀,✔i⚫would💀stop👎using😆emojis😭but😌for😮now❤you're😕a😂fucking😡peice😟of😁shit💩
---
Dude its Robo Platinum
---
upside down much
---
The same thing happened to me on this map but my team was double pipers and a Leon tried to sneak us lol
---
How did you find this? This is one of my oldest posts 😆
---
Ok then he needs to improve the look of it. The gun and showus animations not just showing us dumb skins. And I want to say him make original skins not a piece of crap like avacado Poco, fisherman carl, etc. Those are TRASH.
---
Frank was like; “I played Brawl Stars t’day to be bait... yea, that sounds fun..”
---
Here’s your downvote.. life leech hater..
---
I actually thought this was an ad lol
---
So you hate people for not spending money the way you want them to. Kinda toxic if you ask me.
---
Jelly and Josh
---
And farm their turret which does more dps than their normal atks
---
4/10
---
Stay rightttt there and ACTION
---
Hat’s better. No nostalgia.
---
What whales?
---
Pam and Bull crush Crow close range. Crow doesn’t do enough damage up close to kill tanks. All he can do is poke and stay away from his enemies.
---
This will go sky hot high!
---
Not a bad idea

Lol all brawlers lose 1% of their hp every second so you'll lose in the same time as tick crow piper etc. (If everyone is camping and no one has a healing sp/super)
---
Wow, how did you got that?
---
There is a typo in the title it’s supposed to be my luck in a nutshell.
---
Really? Im climbing trophies by messing around with leon. All i do is go and eliminate the same person over and over again lol
---
ok
---
Just curious what trophy range are you at? For under 500, look for low health brawlers or throwers in showdown and hide in bushes. For other trophies play him a lot in brawl ball, and I feel like he is often overlooked on some bounty maps such as layer cake. Honestly I’m not a great mortis player even he is only rank 20 but that is my advice.
---
In the nex Lunar brawl it will take place
---
Bikini pam skin?
---
also Darryl remodel
---
A brawler should be able to at least be able to deal their own damage. You would need to be carried to push this brawler.
---
It’s the fucking brawl stars cactus. I fucking hate that guy. He’s a bitch. He took my wife and pissed on my kids.

Looking good so far
---
No why not

---

---
Im personally not a fan, but i know other people like it so ill vote 5 in hopes they keep it for those that do.

---
If it gets added I really hope a custom voice is part of it because I really hate playing her because of her voice lines

Mario Kart is p2w tho, but I play it too

I was upvote 1000
---
Hah, I don't care. This is my opinion. And yes I always hated his skins, because some of them are ridiculous but I liked only 0.1%. And yet it's my first time getting karma.
---
Supercell need to add it it's amazing
---
Hehe lets pretend we dont see that
---
But Mecha crow is a 300 original skin and 10k star points for black Mecha.
---
Dragon night Jessie can be bought for 69 gems and a 10k Star points for shadow knight.
---
Does not make sense for this to be 10k.
---
Oh, hahah. That's rly funny, that's what I meant, right? It's, like, no its not f'ing Graveyard Shift, it's Life Leech!!
