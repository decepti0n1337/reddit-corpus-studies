I do believe you have dropped a **-CK,** maybe next time make sure that everything is secured tightly before going. have a nice day sir.

You are a bold one.

I might be able to help with the style, just lemme have your permission and i might redraw such different character.
---
Can relate...
---
And they could just call it Ricochet, rather than “Classic Rico” or “Bandana Rico” or whatever else. It would certainly make it feel like it’s the old Ricochet rather than a skin if the name is kept as it was.
---
It's more like; you get better at the game while playing and with skill you can get your brawlers to a high amount of trophies even without star powers and when you finally get the star powers, you are so skilled that you can defeat some brawlers with star power when you yourself don't have any and with the skill you gained and the star powers you got, you can push much more
---

---
But sure to be a top player you NEED star powers, so you should be maxed when you're a top player, but to achieve this you either spend money or time (or both)

Woahh

I can't even make a 3v3 map

i just did it for fun. also my friend who is at 15k is now at 1201 because he wanted to

This is amazing

I did that for my friend once
---
No way... how?!
---
I got this from a vid what vid tho
---
Ok but don’t confuse it with Spanish

Im suprised that wasnt your free offer

They should go one at a time like Clash Royale emotes

1. The original comment about this issue said that his WINS were because of other people throwing, not that his teammates kept throwing.
---
2. Most people that throw (other than you, I guess) are not throwing to “end the game cos ur bad” but because they get some sort of sick enjoyment out of ruining 2 people’s game to benefit 3 people. 
---
3. People that say “I don’t want to play this match anymore” typically just leave the match, as it is faster than scoring on yourself anyways.
---
Yeah same... just a TROPHY brawler that I see in the screen right now..*Wink wink*
---
Listen I forgot that Leon was a trophy brawler
---
Love it! Could you make one for Mike?

lol congrats.. wish me luck getting my first too

Sorry for the bad quality. I sent that video to a friend as a facebook message, but have no other copies of the video. I have no idea how to convert it from messenger to a reddit post, so I instead settled on recording it with my phone while it played on my laptop lol. I still think it's glorious c:
---
Give me a good reason and ill consider
---
I agree with Grandmaster\_Z. I'm always attacked in Takedown. **Even using all my different ranked brawlers.**
---
She is a nice,respectful,kind person

What I’m trying to say is overall she is a creator that is not bad

How do you nerf Soup?

If the reload speed was doubled then it would take you twice as long to reload

ok.

Thank you :) 
---
Luckily I got him back up FINALLY but dang teamers are just so baddd
---
No one is talking about Sandy throwing sand at his mom? I think that was the best one. (Other than Shelly XD)
---
Try getting queded with 10 trophy brawlers. Luckily it was takedown and they didnt know what the fuck to do  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
OMG SOO GOOD
---
I know man, not to flex or anything but. I main piper so...  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Animating with map maker is pretty god tier!! This is so good m8!
---
I feel like in order to make takedown more enjoyable, player damage to each other should be cut in half or maybe even down to two thirds. But damage to the Bot should be normal.
---
*angry tick noises*
---
Awesome, congrats!
---
Thanks!😁

Too much movement, but great idea!
---
Jessie is literally bouncing
---
Tara is much stronger now. Little steps, but still, well done!
---
no offence, but....r/nooneasked
---
But they said All vs All , so damage to brawler included
---
I get it I just needed to vent a bit
---
Poor Leon
---
See if anyone else is going through the same thing
---
You know that stuff
---
Or maybe ur existence is shit making mortis player shit?
---
I don't think they want to make it about killing others. A better idea would be to make the boss harder (like boss fight furious-enraged hard), and respawn locations predetermined, rather than random. This would make skill a bigger asset, rather than ranks being time and brawler determined.
---
Your concepts are the coolest! Keep up the great work!

Not funny
---
First few seconds of this are a testament to how weak Carl is right now.
---
There is no way he can outplay Darryl with that uncalled-for nerf, without which he would have actually stood a chance against him.
---
Carl is terrible at short range now and you can't pressure anyone enough with long range before they either hide behind a wall or outrun you.
---
Nice! Do you have every brawler?
---
u would not believe the amount of people who chases u down from a corner of the map to the opposite
---
Congrats
---
That's the top 1 percent of players, as shown by Frank.
---
this is 500 trophy gameplay
---
Thanks for that.
---
Doesnt really look male to me but you never know...
---
Ive been playing since the beginning of the beta and have never been maxed 😂 feels bad. If your asking because of how high I am just know even with all lvl ones you can get pretty high, its a pretty f2p friendly game. Always has been and hopefully it stays that way.
---
Wrong size
---
Today I hit the 11k only 300 coins :(
---
Hey! You were teaming! 
---
PS. Don't wooosh me I geddit
---
Except you were their farm and you got 9th along with them :/
---
Honestly, Supercell should just make everyone the same team.
---
I dont think most ppl understand how much time this probably took 😂 good job
---
That poor Leon doesn't see the Bull in the bush
---
I don't like this comparison  
---
It's shoving the favored person into a better scenario then the unflavored
---
Then literally just playing the highest dps brawler will win every time? That's a stupid idea
---
Don't do that
---
That is so good! How many power tens do u have?
---
Im at 14200, 1 legendary, 1 power 10 and my last brawler was at 10k☹️
---
Have you ever heard of canyadigit?
---
You either hit him right as he dashed, or right as he picked up the ball. But yea, he should have been stunned.
---
So he attacks with his feet
---
i hope they fix it in this update its so annoying
---
imagine leon with super in a sandy super in a bush with invisidrink
---
Hahahaha auto aim😅😉
---
i bet he was one of those teaming bibis lol
---
Colonel Sandy...nice
---
Oh my fucking god, AGAIN?!!! After all of what happened you steal AGAIN?! Are you fucking stupid or something?

Damn dude this must have taken you ages to listen to brawlers and to write it all down. This helped me clear up voicelines that I just couldn’t understand (eg: I thought Jessie said “Lady Scar!” but she actually says “Leading Score”).

This is the high effort content that need to get attention.

Oh, ok. Thank you! Gonna add it now! :)

that Leon could have ended it easily with super. the fck he was doing in the bush

He is uncoiling his snake

The attacks lol u should read the post clearer before mistaking me

Thanks! :)

Then everyone will just use bull.
---
Jessie is bouncing

It’s a lot easier w star power but it’s do-able, you just have to play a bit safer when you get low since you don’t have that shield

Now play other game while the game not update

I got 1000 on Bull but everytime I get matched up with 600 to 700 noobs
---
Maybe they should have a practice match with other players. Like maybe a sandbox match that checks the wifi for you

Why did you jump when you had a gene with super?

Honestly, I’m not a fan of this. But if you wanted them to move, I’d say putting the idle animation is better.

I wanna see that nightmare of brother
---
I didnt realize he had it until it was too late
---
There’s more I can add to that. Server-wise, all the replays are stored temporarily, later deleted. The problem comes when the amount of data takes up too much space, which could happen with everyone getting replays.
---
Gedi even commented on the fake ones latest video lol
---
Lol just completed it yesterday

I didnt realize it at first, if I had I wouldn't have jumped.

This gives me motion sickness

It's a fun game mode but it's bad for trophy pushing especially with randoms. I like Brawl Ball, it's fun, but just because many voters picked brawl ball doesn't mean they need to change it

Upvoting

Good meme hope this don't die

So many wasted supers... It's like everyone had to use their super the moment it was available.

wow... me too

Wait till they will make an extesion, or idk, im just at 9k QwQ

Just downvoting me instead of responding because you know I’m right? And now you will say that you are not responding because I’m an idiot or something. But now you won’t respond because I called you out on that idiotic response.

Maybe add club boxes, they are typical magaboxes, when all members collect 10000 star tokens, they can open it

Зачем БЛЭТ в нике? Ты вроде норм играешь

This is a next-level community skin! Astonishing work!

I finally found the solution

I cant see tara at all

Ohhhh, I understand your opinion. So you can play Duo (another showdown type). And you still have a chance to win them ì you have very high skill but in this situation, you have NO CHANCE!!(Am I right??)
---
put a link
---
Thanks.
---
Great. Really fits with this brawler.
---
You just pulled an r/oopsdidntmeanto.

Oh t slymane de l'amino bs

I think yours were fine. But piper using hers just to move up the field. Shelley shooting you from far away. Tara using hers on just Bibi, probably the worst offense since hers takes so long to charge. Brock missed a bunch of his.

I finally have the solution!

Why?

Yes, it's very annoying when you want to dick around with friends in a friendly game or try out new brawlers in a frirendly game but you don't have it.

Great idea!

It's rare to find a good Piper map outside of Bounty. Non-bounty maps usually have awful line of sight and tons of cover.

Cool!

thank you for actually being smart. The person probably doesn’t know what that word means.
---
WTF, HE IS A FRICKING IDIOT!
---
Yep. And to be fair, now that i look at the remaining road, there's really not much to get excited about. There should definitely be a new brawler or atleast a new skin for every brawler at 14500. Now theres about 1300 gold and few mega boxes left for the whole remaining road. After just a few months of playing.
---
Thanks for specifying that it was sandy, I initially thought this was frank

Aaaah I am checking brawl talk all the time!!

What’s even the point in stealing content on insta?

I don’t think there is any revenue.

hello!

Stolen
---
100% joke

agree. Even after reaching 14500, i need a lot of coins. 80% of my brawlerd are lvl 7 or less.
---
Sooo yea, those 150 coins helped me a lot. 
---
Tbh it would awesome if they add more little rewards to the trophy road.

Android users be like:

Are you joking?

Brawl Talk is not based on some kind of milestones or achievements on their social media...   
---
A Brawl Talk will always come before an update, when the update is (!) READY! 
---
I don't want them to rush anything... From my part, I want to give them as much time they need...
---
I personally think that the community needs patience... It's not like if we are spamming with "Where is Brawl Talk" posts/messages, they'll say "Brawl Talk is coming on X day"...
---
I understand that everyone is hyped... But what is too much, is too much...
---
R u actualy that Dumb?

He faces Punchman (Gutsman) to progress the plot

when i saw the eye, i thought this was tara from the brawl halloween trailer. guess i was wrong

hey buddie u should put watermark on ur draws because someone is stealing it and adding they watermark on ur draws

So basically, Duracell is a type of battery that has a pink bunny as the logo.  They’re making a pun by calling it SUPERcell (the company that made Brawl Stars, as you probably know) and using Bunny Penny’s hat instead of the regular mascot.

Lucky me!

Wooow 😃👌

Congratulations

Thanks bro. Now I can finally go outside again

mortis cant eat pizza, he need to keep his fitness
---
Pink team vs Mortis team
---
You hide the name of the clan, but not his name, you either hide both names, so people don't find him, or you don't hide any of the names, so just hinding one name is unnecessary and doesn't has a purpose
---
That’s way too far man...
---
oh okay good point :)
---
Light mode?
---
Yep
---
You can find his clan by searching for it's name, unless you can provide proof you you finding him by name search there's no need to blur it
---
I wish it was like that
---
Stop making these fake review jokes
---
How far do you have to be in the rabbit hole to just “logic” your way out of this!?

i personally preffer pumpkin tick cause it makes more sense

Piper deals 3096 max damage at lvl 10 with Ambush. given that she stands in 8bits super, she deals +30% dmg.... 30% of 3096 ≈ 1k. Her single shot will deal just about 4k damage in these conditions, thats a YIKES
---
Because he has every legendary brawler
---
🗿

People just call it "truce" so they feel better. But it is exactly like teaming. Not attacking the other person but instead completing the objective together. It is a good strategy, and definitely not as morally bad as teaming in showdown. It is ok to team in takedown I would say. But saying that spinning to literally not attack each other and beat the boss together so both have a higher rank is not teaming, is just bullshit
---
Gee how informative u/nibba_big_penor
---
How can i copy this reddit link (im using phone) because i want to record this "toxic attitude" and post it on my YT channel + give credit to the video owner..
---
Exactly what I thought!Thx for support!
---
At least I used it in a creative way
---
Example: A goal is defended by two low dps brawlers and there's an El Primo or other high hp Brawler with a ball. He can just go through them and go to the goal and score an easy goal. But BB matches would be as long as bounty (overtime would still be 1 minute long)
---
Unless it’s skt faker
---
I'm just glad someone else knows
---
People here have no clue whats good or bad or just a harmless sharing of a similar post...
---
But it is in Takedown. It is ok there cause teaming is way more common, and the attackers are usually at higher trophies the annoying ones.
---
Hard 8
---
Well before the trophy change yes,but now I've heard that it's in the top 3%
---
Theres nothing wrong with that... that is literally who has the better team comp or if they have the man advantage. Thats not a problem with the game, he just outplayed the person in that situation
---
i think its trying to “fix” so that you cant walk it in
---
No, this isnt about him being more careful, its him keeping ownership over things hes created. If art is a part of his livelihood, it's even more serious.
---
I would think a decent human being would tell him to watermark his stuff so it cant be stolen.
---
For the record, I never sneered at him, told him to get fucked/he deserved it, you are entirely taking what I said out of context and exaggerating it tenfold with madeup narratives.
---
My verbiage was very specific to not attack him for his actions, I said it the way I did intentionally for it to be applicable to everyone and not be antagonistic towards him.
---
If you legitimately want to support artists, making sure their content is still theirs is kind of the first step.
---
Being able to walk it in isn’t something that should be fixed is all I’m saying
---
No she isnt lmao
---
Let's bang that fake account
---
How to make Piper OP 101
---
Hey and if any of you are wondering why my name is different this is a co account between two people I post and Corrupt does the art so all the credit goes to him.
---
Bad attention is also good attention in this case, regardless of how you feel about it him, it was an ad and a good one for him at that
---
No
---
Fala ae BR (eu acho), geralmente os artistas criam fanarts para Halloween sozinhos, isso foi só um collab pra divulgar vários artistas em um só video, que é muito bom pra chamar público pra eles
---
Porque eles obviamente sabem que a Supercell não ouve nossa comunidade direito... Ou você já viu alguma skin do Gedi_Kor no jogo? 
---
Mas seria deveras interessante ver essas skins no jogo, como a do El Primo Dragonborn :)
---
I used to have 500 total trophies...500 w Shelly..but it was b4 June so it's ok👌

Fast forward 40 seconds to save time.
---
To be fair people steal posts on Reddit all the time and there’s no money to be made here.  Validation is the main reason someone would do that.
---
I wouldn’t care... stop doing things for internet points.
---
I haven't watched jojo part 2 I am sorry but I should right
---
No problem😏
---
...No comment
---
The truth
---
basically game theory
---
You're wasting too much of your time. Leave while you still have the moral high ground.
---
From the moment a player enters the area, they will have a few seconds to be yours (the same if they take care of the enemy). After being yours, you earn 1 point every 2 seconds for example. This is Supercell's choice you know, in the case I described it would be 1 point every 2 seconds as the mode would have 2 minutes and 30 seconds.
---
I'm glad you are aware of this! Very nice artwork btw :)
---
Or the Russian names. And yeah, i agree foo- ok that's your name
---
Yes. I find that more ladylike(I'm kidding...I shouldn't have changed then into glasses huh... but Im kinda lazy to change them back xD
---
It is very easy to talk when you are a p2w player
---
... SAVE THEM TURTLES
---
Cool drawing. If you ask me, it would also be cool to call this “Nita tries pants”
---
Hmm maybe
---
What's a super crown again? (I forgot....)
---
"Forgetting to credit" can be understandable, but placing a watermark this definitely a deliberate act lol
---
Well I dunno how to comment this
---
I believe your thinking of scumbag
---
if u look in the kill log, you killed two people, but still well done
---

---
Whom ever your heart desires
---
That guys got them facts straight
---
No, it’s ok. It’s cool that you see something that may be off for other people. Also, I’m sorry if my opinion hurts you in any way about you art. It’s not intencional in any matter to let you down for what you do.
---
But my mom took my phone and took a picture of herself and posted it D:
---
Hi.. Can i record this gameplay and post it on my YT channel?

There seems to be an influx of own-goalers recently, something has to be done about them
---
How is mega boxes relevant to f2p?
