Thanks for this, I'm probably the only one here who likes ikon and Leon
---
---
---
I took the doublers and opened Mortis thanks to the 2 box that I got F2P
---
Smooth trasitions, awesome edit, 10/10 post
---

---
I want more! LOL
---
The game takes me out every five minutes. Fix it please.
---
dab
---
You don't have to buy anything to get those skins
---
 ppl will get mad for losing and report ppl fpr no reason
---
Ik how. Don't be aggressive in showdown stay alive
---
Why r/engrish
---
Can we get p1 on 8-bits gun and p2 on the classic skins gun? 🎮
---
There's another gold Mecha bo. He's name is Trevor.
---
Wow I wasn't expecting to see gold mechas until the next season. Congratulations u guys are the BS gods
---
Desperately
---
wtf 150 gems and 2000 coins thats like 20 dollars worth of gems and coins
---
Me too
---
Yeah each GLOBAL supercell games have around 30~50 ppl 
---
Rush wars only have 18
---
But I actually think that this has to do with the new brawler, because lots of people are just using him and  I think that this makes something in the match making when you are playing a normal brawler matching you with less trophies people
---
Supercell hate teeth
---
Why don’t you try playing showdown and see how many are in it, maybe even post a picture here?
---
Is anyone shaking?
---
Thats op bruv
---
[removed]
---
 It’s shit they’ll never give you gems for that even if it was GOOD
---
I can't believe some ppl get cheesy views by telling these garbage to naive childrens
---
I like it
---
It really change my mind
---
Thank you it took a while; very much appreciated ;)
---
I thought that it was Cara Steinman, oopsie.
---
What they find in area 51
---
1. Search "8 BIT transparent" (transparent is there so there is no white background)
---
1b. Search meme template 
---
2. Download 
---
3. Open any paint app on your phone
---
4. Insert 8 Bit image
---
4b. Insert meme template 
---
5. Change transparency/opacity of 8 bit
---
6. ???
---
7. Profit
---
I'm a k-pop but I don't even think of doing that
---
Someone got crow and spike out of a box
---
I can see the effort
---
Uhh
---
Thanks for fix Supercell.
---
Nice
---
Damn best suggestion ever good job
---
Guys I’m shaking
---
Repost lol
---
Can you pay for sp?

How in the FUCKING WORLD IS 8 Fucking HUNDRED EASY TO FUCKING GET
---
f my username
---
He is the r/dynamikegang
---
I’m a little lost with that explanation man. Somebody made a post like mine and it seems other people have had this problem
---
Stolen
---
you're 23 days late
---
lmaoo the art is really good but  
---
mortis and poco for the win
---
Because she can kill you without seeing
---
First: The skins are not paid for. They are earned for, only for the best of the best, creme de la creme. These people are at the global leaderboards. Where are you there? You have no right to say all this to them
---
STOLEN ASSHOLE FUCKING DIG A HOLE AND SHOVE THAT HORSEMAN IN THERE WITH YOU
---
I have many 800
---
It hurts too much...
---
Stolen again asshole
---
Why is everyone saying it’s a dab? I honestly think it’s a  freeze frame of The Carlton :v
---
Lol downvoting a good meme with thousands of upvotes ain’t gonna do shit asshole
---
Literally how I feel every game.
---
KILL THAT HORSEMAN TOO ASSHOLE
---
no one understands that the 8-Bit could’ve been in a room with it’s team
---
Thanks
---
T E E T
---
yes
---
Every single brawler is 42.46 inches
---
Guys I'm shaking. I'm fucking shaking. I never wanted to breed with anyone more than I want to with...uh...Pipis? Mortper?
---
Well I mean, poco means little/small in spanish

r/Brawlstars: SUPRECELL REMODEL PIPER PLEASEE!!!!!!!1
---
Supercell: *Remodels Piper*
---
r/Brawlstars:
---
👊🏻
---
 Have you noticed 95% of the meta( 700+) has star powers? how it that an advantage?
---
Maybe all your brawlers are at like 300 trophies lol and you panic when other team has star powers
---
Laugh in Malaysian player
---
Kill away.
---
We played a bunch of games earlier around 750 trophies. I was Neo the Rosa

Bro that was retropolis theme and that was late 60s and this 2019 he's getting old day by day

r/uselesscircle

Ya, seriously, Piper's bullets literally travel at 9999999999999999999999 miles per hour. How can you not hit that?
---
Calarts intensifies
---
I'm saying so because your common sense seems to be uncommon to most of us
---
Way before u i look cool

Basically the first second out of 4 it’s as if enemies are stunned

This is spam. You're gonna wind up getting banned.

Gene derserves his icon because he dont even have a teeth
---
He got rank 6 not 8
---
This is why I seldom play 3v3 modes. Mainly push on solo showdown so I don’t deal with idiots or just a bad team composition
---
I wonder if you choose when you can respawn. Like 2 buttons pop up and choose between respawn or die
---
Oh yeah? Well my record is 4 people. Ha!
---
haha agreed
---
I am very excited about that skin, I hope it comes out tomorrow.
---
Stolen from u/Annie-Brawl-Stars. Everyone downvote this repost.
---
i wnat a report button as well i have 12 screenshots of jerks who must be banned
---
I would be in the lobby waiting for a friend and it would crash
---
The description says the first time you die.
---
SUPERCELL NOISE
---
Well, I want the Stars. I dunno. It's absurd that you can just lose the game before it begins. 
---
Mortis vs a team with two tanks might as well be a forfeit. And it has nothing to do with player skill. You're just gonna lose. There's nothing Mortis can do.
---
I am requesting a context delivery.
---
That happen to me when I did with penny her attack was 7k  and it didn't move
---
And when the bullets bounce, the chocolate comes out
---
before that, they should fix the lag, or else there would be many reports of inactivity xd
---
(Written with translator xd)
---
And the auto aiming
---
Congrats
---
Miso likely 😫
---
Tom is a pro player, he makes money from playing the game in the first place lmao. $200 isn't gonna get you a skin either, it's mainly time. The amount of money you spend is what determines the amount of time you'll spend though, so there's that.
---
By "Best Value" I think they meant the highest number of gems lmao
---
It's because nobody manual aim everyone's busy auto aiming with her.
---
I feel you
---
🥵
---
this is one of those skins where I feel like supercell would be dumb for not putting this in the game. I felt the same way about Shark Leon and Serenade Poco
---
It's only a bug avaliable while friendly matches so just don't take this too seriously :)
---
I try...🐄
---
Bibi is not that bad.
---
That'd be great. It works for me sometimes too, like if I'm a tank and I see a Mortis and a Mike on their team, I know it's gonna be GG lol
---
Local kid named leon in a shark outfit has been found in the beach and seemed to be drowned. Hate like at the end of the day I punch my door because a 8- bit killed me.
---
El Primo would've died if Spike had Curveball
---
Ikr funny 😆🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🅱️
---
I made a post about it,
---
That was epic
---
I'm glad they did this so there's more variety
---
A small price to pay for salvation
---
Never understood why anyone would do this
---
Spend on mega box if u want to progress fast. You can only buy one each season though
---
Who the hell even makes nether portals with the corners
---
As a Dynamike, I think this is epic
---
You use CORNERS!!!
---
He shoots 4 shells x2 same as Frank. Auto aim targets the very center so at range the shots go to either side of the brawler
---
Ggwp!!
---
REEEEEEEEEEPOST
---
8 bit does not approve
---
Are you the same one that drew mortis as bodyguards for poco?
---
What if supercell were to make this into a legit map?
---
r/woooosh
---
That was last time lol...now that he is retired , his other teeth dropped
---
Andoird's screen capture capabilities.
---
He has not released
---
They didn't nerf boxes.

Actually this is a iPhone Xs Max and I used Photoshop to combine all screenshots😉

---
Didn't even try to hide that you stole this
---
No. Piper’s starpower is pretty balanced now. It’s skill based not unlike Shelly’s “camp in a bush for 20s and you get a free extra life” kind of starpower.
---
Wow! I really like the stats. I can really see that you did put in a lot of effort and I am a big fan of them. You did a great job!👌😁 I like their Super a lot.
---
And yes of course I'd like to see the voice lines.
---
Nope, as far as I can see, you're the only one in the giant tub of liquid nitrogen.
---
No.  This would prob make certain bralwrs way too strong in the Meta.
---
Lol ikr
---
Walking on magma*
---
Now for the Voicelines (theses are just som possibilities, not all of them)!:
---
*Spawning In/start of match*: Friz/Burn: “Lets do this, bro!”, Chil/Fost: “Let us begin, Brother!”, Friz/Burn:”Your lagging, bro.”, Chil/Fost: “Don’t hold us back, brother.”, Friz/Burn: “Now I’m fired up!”, And Chil/Fost: “Keep your cool, and you will win.”
---
*Attackinking*: Friz/Burn: ”Fear my flames!”, Chil/Fost: “Cower against the cold.”, Friz/Burn: “Heat is neat!”, Chil/Fost: “Pierce you cold as ice!”
---
*Friz/Burn kills someone*: “Ha, roasted!”, “Can’t take the heat, can’t you?”
---
*Chil/Fost kills someone*: “The frost is boss!”, “I wasn’t that cold, wasn’t I?”
---
*Both kill someone at once. Either main attack or Super*: Friz/Burn: “We did it, bro!” then Chil/Fost says “Yes we did.”, Chil/Fost: “Thanks for the help, brother.” then Friz/Burn says “No prob, bro!”
---
*using Super*: Friz/Burn: “Help me out bro!” as Chil/Fost says “Right!”, Chil/Fost: “Brother, I need you.” as Friz/Burn says “On it.”
---
*Friz/Burn dies*: “I’m toast.”, “I overheated a little bit.”, or Chil/Fost says “Brother, I’ll avenge you!” or “This is bad.”
---
*Chil/Fost dies*: “I have to chill out.”, “Done, cold turkey.”, or Friz/Burn says “Oh no bro.” or “Bro, NOOOOOOO!”
---
*Victory Lines*: Chil/Fost: “Two is always better than one.”, Friz/Burn:”Together forever, pal!”, Chil/Fost: “A cool victory!”, Friz/Burn: “What a Heated match!”
---
Hope you like the voice line ideas, I tried to make the build of each other since they they are opposites in way. Keep up the excellent work man!
---
I could never ever see piper hitting the grass, idk wym. Maybe Bo (native person uses ancient medicine), Poco ("feel the power of music" "too bad, man"), etc. There are way more fitting options..
---
Geez u have -2 likes lol why are you like this
---
I love Piper's remodel so much, but they better close her eyes in game!
---
I have the same problem every day, but the problem is that the game acts like stocks, sometimes it gets good, sometimes it doesn't. My advice: play at another time when its not fun or just take a long break from the game.
---
YEEE HAAW
---
Perfect
---
Anytime I see Mortis and Poco, I upvote
---
Only time Mortis looks good without the hat is when it’s in arts like this.
---
Change my mind
---
can’t believe people are falling for this troll haha
---
Hold up you dumb ass 8 year olds. This isn’t the same person who scored the same goal as to the same person who posted this.
---
Maybe this is why they're doing more maintenance 😂
---
Yep I appreciated
---
[I understood that reference](https://youtu.be/l8g0z8yZ6FU?t=600)
---
F
---
It literally says maintenance break lmao it's not crashing
---
I don't agree with everything in this post but the main fact I agree with is that pushing over and over again every season IS going to get stale very fast (for some it already has). They need to implement something else in this game soon. My opinion is they should add some new non-ranked mode and revamp the entire friendly battle system in addition to adding some new mode for clans.
---
Because Darryl is my 2nd favourite brawler in the game, I get a lot of experience on playing him, and I think Darryl is pretty underrated because people play him like Shelly and Bull, which is incorrect, I’ve seen some skilled Darryl play him like an assassin, a correct way to play. If people play him like an assassin instead of a heavyweight, I think he’ll see so much more plays
---
scrappy was deployed at the same time you shot the hand, which just made you grab scrappy instead, pretty simple.
---
These brawlers would probably get a small buff during this time period. I aimed to promote the usage of these brawlers so people would participate in the Pirate Takeover theme.
---
Play Bibi with speed boost or Colt with star power and you go super sonic.
---
iOS players also are crashing
---
It depends on your trophy range.  If you have most of your bralers above or near 500, then go for it!
---
Yes! Darryl is not supposed to be played like shelly and bull. He is a really good assassin, and some people don’t get that ;w;
---
They are improving the servers or something
---
23outta28 or 29 the games under maintence for me
---
rico? if so, a crossover would be nice i like that
---
They could only look at users that accumulate X number of reports from different players.
---
skillz
---
I think it was a good idea to open her eyes in game tbh. It may not look the best but it helps her character make more sense, it’s not possible she was blind scoping the whole time lol
---
Yes, old siege was so much better. SC really needs to improve on its communication with community members especially when big changes to game modes are made...and stop deciding certain things on their own (e.g. doubling rewards and losses just because the mode is (was) 2x longer, etc...
---
LiKe AnD sUbScRiBe AnD yOu WiLl GeT lEoN iN 10 yEaRs
---
Get this man a remodel, And remove his teeth.
---
Crossing my fingers and toes to see 8-Bit get nerfed🤞🏼
---
No just get the power point deals and level up all brawlers you have or the ones you play most. I wouldn't waste my star points on this deal. That said, if you're picking between the 500 or 1500 of course get the 1500 because you get 10 boxes worth whereas the 500 one only gives you 3 boxes worth. 
---
But think about it, you could get one big box from just winning 10 matches (getting 10 big keys) and you don't have to spend any star points....
---
I love the voice lines. They are very creative and show their personalities. I am a big fan of the lines when they die. You helped add so much more character and personality to my idea and I thank you for that.
---
You think
---
I've been facing continues crashes so I am glad they are doing maintenance at least.
---
Your journey has just begun.
---
Wow that's amazing.
---
Omg lol same here
---
THX
---
how
---
the matchmaking is based on ranks, not power levels
---
What, do you not want them to address the issues that are happening with a maintenance break?
---
A bunch of people’s devices are crashing with the update, so they’re probably trying to fix it. Be patient
---
God damn I miss the old Top Gear.
---
it’s based on ranking not power level
---
the offer costs 20 dollars
---
Lucky but P2W
---
Damn it’s u again lol u said this on another post
---
Look at the delay tho, it never should have grabbed scrappy, it landed almost a full second after my grab passed where it landed
---
People like this are the reason we need a goddamn report teammates button. 
---
SUPERCELL HAS A SURVEY ON NOW - ADD THIS AS A COMMENT WHEN YOU FILL IT OUT.

Thanks!

Literally nothing 🤣

My eyes!  no pants barley holding a questionably shaped bottle to cover himself. Oh my eyes!
---
8-Bit's 2nd star power (not out at this time) Let's you instantly respawn once per game.
---
And band-aid got nerfed from full health to only 2000 when shelly is under 40%
---
it's also a meme.
---
i’m guessing when jessie throws the turret, the hitbox for scrappy is preplanned which is what made you grab it
---
It happens for a friend,only if we don't play again.Even then it's a chance
---
Aii
---
But then a ton of ppl would use these brawlers and matchmaking would be slow.
---
Too complicated, too much changing the meta. I'd rather the above users suggestion of increased rewards instead.
---

Blind Scoping ppl would look rly badass tho, just like how Piper is supposed to be.
---
It doesn't always have to be red
---
Country Poco isn't real he can't hurt you.
---
Country Poco:
---
hahahahahaha 1 sec
---
Is none bothered by the fact he took a screen shot of all 28 brawlers
---
Just hit 10k and I only have 23 brawlers
---
Hahahah ok now I understand why they're doing maintenance rn 😂
---
Hello fellow El Primo fan. I'm happy to see you.
---
His name sounds like a 10 year old kid
---
But isnt barley already naked? XD
---
niceee 😁
---
I was about the get on BS to see what she looked like with her eyes opened again.
---
**Maintenance break**
---
Oh. Thanks! I didn't really take into mind matchmaking. Improving as you read this comment.

#STOP FUCKING POSTING THIS

Sorry don't be mad but I don't know what that is😅
---
You’re hit by a car and have depression? Good.
---
Thank You and I'd live to see them be added in game too.
---
Wait... how old Carl is?
---
U stole mah ideea i think but that is some serious shit right here
---
Mad scientist barley is a better name
---
Not at all

he probably stole Piper's \*T H E E T\*

How the fuck can you nerf curveball

Personally I like using the star power bug to play 8-Bit with Home Run, and he just winds up being Magnum Special Colt but with higher stats.
---
Shame it doesn’t work in a real match, but it’s a lot of fun.
---
And by shame, I mean I am extremely glad the star power bug can’t ahoe up online.
---
This is what you're all complaining about now? Letters not being uppercase?
---
Mate, it’s a new update that they dropped one day ago. Chill out.
---
Ye
---
Wait so you get the damage boost and healed at the same time?
---
I had no crashes, just annoying lags
---
O key
---
No heal
---
I saw your original one! Great art.
---
Yeah but then there will be nothing but those 3 brawlers and there will be a stale meta every single season.
---
Judt imagine the "shotgun takeover" 🤦🏽‍♂️
---
Yup fits great... especially with  the crazy hair
---
You obviously like spike and use curveball which require no skill and its too strong. Well, don't believe me, watch YDE's video "Former 1500 trophy Spike opinion on Curveball Star Power/YDE"
---
That’s not me. I reported this to supercell so that the troll can get banned.
---
Don't celebrate too early
---
Bye bye fingers
---
funnier*
---
Of course also the Mortis dies cus he don't have the hat so he's kinda retarded
---
Not true... Shelly and colt are OP
---
I ginally save enough for this skin
---
Same. And wifi bars are even worse.  Supercell ticket created, they immediately closed it, told me it was my phone.. Pretty toxic.  I provided detailed data about my network configuration and detailed data on games that work just fine that are more network intensive.
---
Great
---
this is so cool if this gets added, on hallowen we could get one for Mortis and Frank,but i agree with people in the comments saying we should get only bonus rewards
---
Oh my glob 8-bit are playing with yourself
---
His second one is fine as is.
---
I'm feeling tingly......^jk
---
I checked the leaderboards. Nobody ha 25k trophies currently
---
lol i wasnt wasn't serious. i just meant buff his hands
---
I would have uninstalled if you did that to me
---
Yes. I feel for you. My friend got bullied by this troll. This is so annoying. So reported this to supercell. I hope this person can get banned.
---
I was thinking about this post for some time and I thought about this. Since you've maxed out all of your brawlers, you know get a lot more coins. Doesn't that mean you can buy the star powers from the shop now at 2K each?
---
At least you have gene. I’m in the same spot (minus gene)
---
Sorry lol
---
Unicycle guy vs robot who can go forever
---
Yo.... you .. .. good???!?
---
Mf wtf is this
---
I understand by the fact that he can heal and damage boost allies.But i dont think that supercell would agree with this,im not saying that this is a bad representation of a brawler,is just the fact that they would have a lot of balancing to do of how u imaginated to be
---
He wrecked her p...y.
---
Wtf?
---
Well it really is a maintance break, if you dont want your game crashing every 9 minutes, then wait
---

Good idea for seasons but this would just make them op
---
No.

So is that why bugs are bein fixed?

The design looks a little too much like crow but otherwise, I think it’s a really good idea

This is a map for bulls,shellys,and primos i can already see the triple shotguner kill

HHA LOL YES-

Thank you. I will credit you on picture, title and comments, ok?

Yeah I wanted a other bird brawler but it end up looking a lot like crow(after my school trip I want to redo it with my table)

Why does everyone attack leon. That shelly is literally a bigger threat
---
Yea but i have been seeing this 10000000 Times sorry i was getting irritated
---
I don't care if it's racism or not. It's English subreddit.
---
Why?
---
We already in 8-bit meta dude
---
Add some Star Powers as well. Since the brawlers got double Star Powers I didn’t find any Star Power.
---
**I’m detecting seismic activity**
---
That would be a great star power getting extra damage when you’re around ur bear
---
Ohhh salut romanule ;)
---
Duo sd and spin in the middle of the map lol
---
At least you didn't find it on instagram

Did I beg someone? Dummy dum -_-

She used her super to jump over him.

Sorry I delete link for my post
---
Tbh Supercell are trying to polish the game for new comers, and I swear to god there is atleast one dumbass uneducated idiot saying " ugh i HATE this update, MAKE A NEW ONE YOUR SO DUMB" and to that? I disagree because, do you expect a company to make way too much models and lines of code in a day/week? NO, which is why we should appreciate Supercell for giving us what we wanted, we got 3 things the community has been CRYING for the last couple of months, New Brawler, Leon Skin, Permanent Brawl Ball. And what did we give them? HATE honestly we should stop crying about, afterall beggars can't be choosers.
---
thanks :)

i meant if it happened a year ago , and piper wasn't remodeled yet that gotta happen with old piper or other brawlers

I don't know about OP, but he's really fun. If you've had experience against him, you can deal with him easily, but plenty of people don't have that experience.

Got damnit u said ut before me

Yeah send me a video of u jumping from a bridge I want to watch it when i'm depressed.
---
For those who will downvote this comment and say i'm mean and heartless, I wasn't serious, and every idiot can notice it's just a 7 yrs old kid that wants everyone's attention and upvotes, in some of his other posts he said a FUCKING black person attacked him (Fuck u kid, u lied,ok,just as usual, but why did it have to be a BLACK person?!) and in another post he said he LITERALLY killed himself cuz of our hate comments! WTF the only thing this kid got is mental problems not depression and suicidal feelings!
---
It's the last way to get upvotes, btw ur the main shitter in r/shittybrawlstars, yeah i'm evil and mean and heartless and all of this shit, but I must downvote every single post of u/PooPooHead123444 (I would've downvote u just cuz of this name) and write this, so yeah downvote this comment idc

Is he professor kukui ?
---
That means your friend is not going to get a new brawler anytime doon
---
she's S tier with SP
---
That all his work you fuc
---
All long range brawler. What was that question. If you lose to a shelly or bull as colt, brock, piper etc. then you must be really bad at the game.
---
I think the game crashed because of a issue with memory leaks
---
You are skilled player,maybe
---
I don't see any long range brawlers. 9/10 players are shelly.
---
And only with her sp! She is useless without it! Only good for landing one shot and then dying eating bullets
---
Cuz he stooooopid
---
This template could probably work even better if the images were in reverse order
---
Im not complaining abou the remodel, I think its ok, but I still like the old piper more.
---
I hope I can use darryl to squeeze through the water
---
Nah is good
---
I know but he's abusing the leon he's grinding with him(not dirty joke) he's almost at no cause I'm helping him get there with other brawlers(duo or brawl ball)
---
Nope its my work you can trust me
---
#No.
---
This ain't my first rodeo! Congratulations
---
u/uwutranslator

3 bad one good
---
I just got Bibi and i see tons of Bibi in every game type so far! Especially good in brawl ball. Really loving her maybe coz she’s a little challenging to play with. I just briefly saw some videos etc and i play her with lotsa juking, slowly getting closer to the enemy while charging the pushback and trying to corner the guy! Cant wait to get her star power for that speed boost though 🤤
---
Its not correct im getting bored i dont have new brawlers for like 2 3 months
---
Nice Worke Dude can i use this meme Format?
---
Getting a better position is outplaying your opponents as they arent paying attention to you. If you keep complaining a out how is he "no skill". Then  why wouldnt pam and shelly be the same? Shelly just Bush camps a d pam just shots randomly and it happens to hit everyone. Just because 8 bit has a long range  doesnt mean he is bad . Its EXTREMELY DIFFICULT  to line up your shots withs that movment speed. Let alone dodge anything why do yo think they would add the "1-up" Star power? 8 bit is a sitting duck if he gets just 5 tiles too close to his enemies.  Then he gets deleted by everyone. If you struggle against him then play around him. Every brawler has his weakness and 8 bit is no exception.  8 bit is meant to be a new and dynamic brawlers.  But let me ask you. Tick is also maily about how you get positioning in the map.  And he has the longest range of all the throwers. Would you call him no skill? No you wouldn't believe tick was out for months a d everyone knows how to deal with him. 8 bit is only like 4 days old and your already saying hes broken?
---
The changes had nothing to do with fun. People still hate it because they still suck at it. They just don’t think they tilt as hard as they used to because they only lose half....they just lose faster now. The changes ruined the game mode. If people took the time to learn to play siege properly(tanking bots, knowing when to charge, playing for control instead of bum rushing every bolt), it would be the most popular game mode by far.
---
You see a lot of bibi players because you JUST GOT BIBI. Go past rank 10 see how there are absolutely zero bibi players.
---
Ok thanks for your support guys
---
Lol
---
I downvoted, now jump off a bridge please
---
Can't stop the haters🤷‍♂️

Actually, I was making a few screenshots of 8-bit for my friend, who has no wifi this week, and saw this one between the rest

Hmm i see but im already at rank 12 and my plays this afternoon had lotsa them though 🤔

I need more accounts with the amount I would want tp see that
---
Ok sure
---

---
Yea i noticed that alot more 12k players are easier to play against than before.  Maybe because they are retired ppl and came back because of the update?

---
you may not rest now, there are creatures of the night nearby
---
Why are the FBI knocking my door?
---
&gt; Yes, it is technically true that the overall SP-to-trophy ratio has increased a little bit, this increase is **solely** in the lower ranks.
---
No, it is not. It is across **all** ranks, up until the last rank at 1400 trophies. While it is true the ratio gets worse the higher the rank under the new system, the overall conversion rate is higher compared to the old system. Only when as mentioned, you have more brawlers over 1400 (and get no additional point) than the lower ones that can cover the losses.
---
But honestly, what is end game to you? How many people even have that many trophies for brawlers individually? I tried to search on Twitch for past broadcasts, found a "global 4th/6th" (https://www.twitch.tv/videos/471678759?t=02h33m52s) has his highest brawler just barely passed 1000 trophy before the last reset. Is your concern really an issue?
---
I like it!
---
I get it why they steal,But thats also morally wrong,stealers deserve a permaban for 10 weeks.
---
Piper sure is cute now but no one can be cuter than the brilliant Bibi tho

Sharing an opinion is now pointless it seems like

Hey for me is laggy now too(I'm on a moto g5 plus). Thanks for the update

There are two kinds of "slow"

The only thing that's gonna be in the 3rd box is mortis

wow i have the same amount of gems as you ! what a coincidence

Same

Sry
---
It is in the game actually, not a concept.
---
Bc all the other brawlers have black eyebrows in their icons.  They’re trying to make in consistent.
---
Her eyes are woke
---
Nadar means swimmer right?
---
Same i have him at rank 20 and power 2

so the first favourite is showdown and the second is gem grab but yeah i love playing brawl ball cause i am a football fan :)

There is no proof if that's correct and even if that should be the case thats not your business srly

Oh I’m sorry, if I came off as mean I’m not trying to be. I just thought I kept overlooking it when trying to find it. Please forgive me if I seemed harsh. And you should put your needs before other people’s wants.
---
Ohh ok
---
Well now the max rank is 35, at 1020 trophies.. I think it’s 1020.
---
Don’t Play sd and go for 3v3
---
There are some toxic players who do that to intentionally gain tokens and exp by losing really fast.  After all, although not recommended you do get a hell of a lot of experience and tokens for just losing

That's not how it works

If the 8-bit skin had effects of other colors in its basics it would be beautiful, gray or black for example, as well as the games of the gameboy

You know, maybe you should credit the original person who made this

And Bull feels like... Yeah, an enraged bull with Red Bull
---
I play with myself too. Just a bit differently of course ;)
---
didnt get it
---
._.XD
---
Imma drop him the suicide hotline *juuuuusst in case*
---
so he can stop wasting our time and actually improve himself or get banned whichever one of the two
---
Ok this is getting too far, you are clearly 100x worse than Dairus Brawl Stars became Dairus only stole 1 post from Gedi. You not only stole multiple GEDI’s art, but also stole from more like u/ChronoPierce as well as different people’s memes, this is too unacceptable, 100x more unacceptable than Eye of the Storm
---
I swear if you dare steal a post from u/Develop_Art or u/SaltedSpirit, whether if it’s Brawl Stars related, or not
---
u/GEDI-KOR
---
Wait, so what’s the reward for a draw?
---
Hes a rico disguised as an 8bit
---
Always love to see some good art
---
r/MortisGang, asseble
---
Dude that was me with spike but i wanted primos star power
---
Thx :D
---
I can imagine myself pulling the bot onto the launchpad as gene
---
ok if you say so
---
Yeah I know its a new glitch. I think they'll fix it soon
---
Idk why people are complaing about this. It never happened to me
---
One Shelly doesn't have the star power.
---
NOT SO PERFECT
---
For sure, just curious why a u/ is scribbled out in bottom left..also funny how you replied so fast.. Guilt?
---
How did i see Leon and not Crow?
---
If u wanna be a fiminist aka the scum of the earth go somewhere else no one wants to hear ur crapy conspiracys just enjoy the game and if you cant do that then dont play
---
Love at first *spike*.

Damn 3 gems OMG

Time to get Megaboxes and Skins!

Repost
---
Oh, mematic...my apologies, have a nice day.
---
I was saw 5 player like that I don't know whyyyy really amd I have 12.5k trophies and I don't have legendary😥
---
If supercell added him i would shrink them
---
Tick completely crushes 8 bit on any map that isn't open. Being super slow and having a constant rain of bombs is just hell
---
Lmao they JUST added shark leon so it might take a while
---
Really? Seems pretty real for me.
---
Birb: I dont wanna alarm you but there may be a creature or creatures of the night in our house
---
Yeah the icon looks really bad now. I used to use it because it looked cool now it just looks weird.
---
idk but i guess that's a good thing
---
Then how did I get both Leon and crow f2p on different accs?
---
After all these nerfs mortisgang has been receiving we need/want a nerf right?
---
Hey is this still not fixed?
---
He didn’t... some player are just kind and when they use only one ticket and they are big brawler they want to give the other player “a present”
---
Burn this with fire
---
It's too good to be true it may be Photoshopped
---
People seem to always have to complain about something
---
Leon - I'm just gonna chill in this bush. No harm done..
---
*Sees a random brawler approaching with a death stare*
---
Leon - AIGHT IMMA HEAD OUT.
---
This is really good. Try posting it in 
---
r/cursedbrawlstars because that is the sub for brawler fusions
---
I actually got coiled snake today, so no
---
I just realized that Darrel has a Pirate Hat
---
Is there a season? I don't get it
---
Yes
---
&gt;cekoner
---
what does it mean
---
Hey, Supercell! I'd like to know if you guys could add something in Brawl Stars replays that you already added in other creations of yours like Clash of Clans or Clash Royale: Pause Replay and Speed up Replay.
---
I think it would be a great idea, even because it would be really helpful for those who make YouTube videos and need to cut out some scenes out of the Replay!
---
always retarded mates in brawlball lol
---
No... Just you...
---
Plz
---
Hehe its spanish
---
I lowkey like the shadows tbh
---
😇 Welcome dude anytime 👍
---
But that shelly is in the midle
---
Yeah i think so. Took me 4 months before i got 2 star powers this week.
---
Well don't worry about what they think dood, they rarely do that
---
Comment did not specify in the training cave *cough*
---
wtf
---
Pipers new icon looks so creepy
---
They called me a madman
---
Fake.
---
His account already got banned, he got a new one, banning won’t help, sadly
---
F for everyone who did not get legendarys
---
164 coins!!!
---
What’s the app called that you found this on?
---
imagine getting someone not a shelly or a bull in snake prairie
---
Brawl stats
---
wow I have no words for this just fantastic
---
everyone can use it
---
I hated the Dynamike model in beta
---
We all know you aren’t Justin Bieber, you are PooPooHead123444, an idiot
---
Do I spy a fellow r/IASIP fan?
---
.......get rank 20 on lvl 1 Mortis only in Heist
---
Quite a bit, actually. Surprised they didn't fix it with the latest remodel.
---
Thank you
---
I dont know why this looks fake to me...maybe cos thay said "gem advantage" instead of "powercube advantage".Or that they said "stuck" like getting stuck is a normal thing.or is it the incorrect grammar they used...Oh I know!its because the anime thot!
---
They should add this
---
I had NEVER complained about ANYTHING supercell did
---
What's your country?
---
u/FlyingMachine33
---
Coc is better imo
---
I mean does he need one?
---
Imagine 2  mortises on cavern churn
---
Spike
---
Wow
---
20k damage
---
ik
---
Fair enough
---
Greetings
---
the shelly almost gave up at the start then started helping I wish the other 3 get banned tbh...
---
Tick
---
It’s purely rng
---
Me too :)
---
I don’t get how anyone thinks the old versions better
---
That Bo description is so accurate, I can't...
---
This is actually pretty cool
---
It wouldn’t take up a slot though because it’s a ticketed event
---
True af 😂
---
I don’t get it sorry
---
Stolen but redrawn perhaps?
---
You missed the sarcasm in his comment, he was talking as if he was you despite it being unnecessary
---
Although I know it's a troll, I'm getting too uncomfortable already.
---
Did this with shelly
---
I don’t have Morris yet, I’m not lucky at all, but when I do, I will try this challenge.
---
His invisibility is good in showdown, but it doesn't deserve a nerf
---
He is good as is
---
And making him visible from even farther is kind of dumb and should never be done
---
I agree, they were bland looking and pale in comparison to the vibrant colors and dynamic art style that is shared by all the new models and new brawlers. But OG's want to feel special
---
Yo how the freak did you get so many star powers
---
Wow gościu jak?
---
Shelly and bull are OP
---
Not really 8-bit has more health a MUCH higher DPS and a more helpful super.
---
#hA Ha hA iTs 419  gEt iT?????
---
Instagram meme pages be like: It's a free real estate
---
How about no
---
Friendly battles
---
Exactly the community was begging for a brawl talk, they gave us the brawl talk, then the community begs for an update, they gave us the update and now the community is crying their asses off for more😒
---
penso che appena finita la partita abbiano disinstallato il gioco
---
#giveGamerLmcMortisSoHe/SheCanCompleteMyChallenge
---
Then His IP Address should be banned instead, if that's possible.
---
So why you taking screenshots with downvoiting it
---
That’s against the rules
---
Yes lmao Dynamikes super almost always hits me when Im playing 8Bit even if I think he missed me
---
I think 3 shooting Leon Penny Jessie etc is kinda crazy
---
i love how the expressions of the icons matches the meme.
---
you'll post it on reddit?
---

I had to do a real match since the bot wouldn't use his super. Ever
---
And it was stupidly hard protecting the carl while he's trying to kill you (had to waste a super or else Rosa would have kill him) but the results came in. 
---
Stuns, pulls and knockbacks can actually stop it.
---
I already did
---
r/notawoooosh
---
Great idea but you do realise how many of us F2Ps wouldn't be willing to sacrifice that many tokens and would just wait for the club to do it?
---
^^mortis and ^^darryl
---
Same, remember to save up because there will probably be a bunch of limited time skins during Halloween!
---
Why would it be an Easter egg
---
How would they fix it? It’s part of the umbrella it’s the clip to keep it closed
---
Shitpost
---
I apologize, that was bad customer service.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
^(worth it)
---
Antisocial af
---
I haven't even noticed... :))) You've got good eyes! xD
---
Say whhhhaatt
---
Um I don’t think you will get away with that bc that is 100% impossible to happen so the time was off, it’s supposed to start as a small blue spinning crow then gets bigger so Yeah, 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️😑😂😂😂
---
I mean, he still has a middle finger if the 4th is a thumb.
---
It's not. If you are an active player and at least get all the  tokens and star tokens every day, you can get enough coins to upgrade a brawler from 8 to 9 in a week or a week &amp; a half.
---
I just unboxed Tara and it's been a pain for me to find games at a low trophy too
---
It happens when bo throws his mines too
---
yeah but with Leon on top
---
I know EURONA2 it’s that it has a gap between the umbrella and that pink strap on it 😅
---
Rewards are rewarding? Wuuuuuut? I'Ve never thought about such thing in my life!
---
Yeah, since effect as a verb means to cause, while affect means to change.
---
Said by a noob
---
OHHHH OFCCC
---
Same happened with Bo mines when the arrow deployed them, especially before Bo remodel
---
Also, I probably won’t because no one ever sees my posts.
---
Plug walk
---
It looks like it was made but u/SaltedSprint
---
My favorite was when dinnermike threw he's super 11/🔟
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA u r trash man I have 24 brawlers without a starpower and i was in 12k before the update
---
Brawl stars crash continue
---
No problem, anytime.
---
Facts
---
bruh
---
Ransoms like to stay inside our goal in brawl ball
---
You Got Some Good Photoshop Skills Bro,But You Did An Mistake.When you photoshoped that spinning crow,in the bottom right of the screen there were bonus items,but when you started tapping you had only usual stuffs in your box.Otherwise you have good Photoshop skills boi,you can continue this but be careful with small details Cuz those can make the difference.
---
Now the black eyebrows in the icon fit the actual model.
---
i mean it doesn’t even look real, i don’t think there r usually where borders around each reward
---
EDIT: nvm i just hopped on bs and opened a box, there are white borders, gj Op
---
We don’t like emojis here
---
i just opened 157 boxes and didn't got one star power uhahuhuahuahu 
---
next day i opened one free box and got one star power, i think the game felt sorry for me.
---
Awesome idea! And btw how do you start a conversation with them? Pls show me
---
This is false
---
Mortis is outside
---
Doesn't make teaming a good choice
---
All hail bion
---
Well I don't think that normal people/bot will comment any with random emojis.
---
Nah just make the laser speed increased so it hits more accurately
---
You stole this
---
......bruh.....
---
BRUH 😂😉👹🅱️✌️🌚👇🏻
---
It's pretty balanced now imo.
---
a lot of time to explain
---
Both
---
Rip mega box
---
No only bruh bot is allowed to do that
---
Ask BS support in game
---
TRUE
---
Defeats the point of unlocking brawlers ;)
---
Why where you teaming anyway??
---
BULL
---
Next time keep the pitch low low
---
I know but i got sandwitched   ok... i know teaming is not good
---
So what?
---
add the humor flair please thank you
---
Gene??
---
Ive seen a the dynamike star power. It was a tiny bear that flys around him. I think it will just be a little meat shield
---
I didnt make it sintrox did it 
---
So u copy
---
Yes, I think the code is in one of the posts in the community section on their YouTube channel.
---
It's not called 1-up
---
So you don’t have it?
---
Wow, so this is the “new concept” you told me about. You are the worst attention seeker on reddit
---
Pretty sure it’s caused by the 3D perspective view which gives you a perception of depth
---
Ima play with my fock
---
Assuming you’ve never seen game of thrones?
---
So your Justin briber, but your drake, and now your Jeff?
---
Part 2 will be the model, Part 3 is gonna be the info and everything with the graphics from the previous parts
---
Yep i didn't
---
Respect the effort but its ugly af
---
NOT FUNNY
---
DIDNT LAUGH
---
I never had more than one 8-bit per team per game while playing him. Strange... played like 15 games and got matched with 200-300 trophy brawlers.
---
what are u planning on? making supercell poor and destroying their whole carrier ? why players only think of their selves and forget that devs have to make money too. if they will add this no one will ever spend money on the game
---
Yes, it’s a pretty common bug and brawl stars knows about it
---
Yah I kinda can't do that...
---
Do you have any other ideas for the next fusion?
---
people just think of their selves and forget that supercell also have to make some money to keep updating the game
---
NOT FUNNY NOW DIDN'T LAUGH BECAUSE I CHANGE MY OPINION
---
Stonks
---
this one has been around for a while now. surprised u haven't seen it
---
Guys just play a few games of brawl ball and you will see that’s off 1 block
---
I wish this was oficial
---
Don't worry😄this post are reposting on r/shittybrawlstar, a subreddit who hate the brawl subreddit and repost the "shitty" (the post who have a lot of upvote) on it, you can view the "not funny post" on it👌
---
the graphic is not as professional, but i like it
---
It's secret program from FBI
---
Lol , seriously you can’t say that 😂
---
u/ContentForager is a bot that randomly reposts posts from a random sub to r/mistyfront every 10 minutes. Look at that sub's description.
---
Hang on, why would a company need to make money?
---
Okay, let's make this clear. It is NOT a repost.
---
How is it normal for you?
---
Very epic
---
Wow that’s creative
---
Okey, it's prisma 3d😀
---
Nita's bear doesn't fit in Poco?
---
People could spend those 5€ on more important stuff
---
Dramatic slow motion save but in real time
---
You are not the only one :D
---
Thx bro
---
They can just not pay for it like I said the pass was a big improvement even if you dont intend to pay for it. It isnt exclusive for people that pay for it.
---
Pipers star power
---
how did he get it as gene?
---
Ahh I see your using ibis paint X.
---
It’s a bug in customs
---
Thanks, means a lot
---
Pipers star power- when she hits her target she reloads her next shot .4 times faster
---
(I’m pretty sure)
---
Aha hello
---
I stopped playing around the Mega Knight update so I can't really have a fair opinion on the Pass Royale. Looks ass but my opinion isn't valid since I haven't played the game when it was added.
---
Spend more gems get a better deal, just like how you spend more money you get more gems
---
Sure it's just 5$, but I don't want something in the back of my mind telling to spend 5$ every season just to have fun, I should be able to purchase stuff in the game whenever I want to, weather in days or years
---
Ikr. Just. Fuck. Off.
---
Looks sick bro
---
Bruh bot has the only right to do that you uncultured swine.
---
*you may not sleep there a creatures of the night near by*
---
This is an amazing gem.
---
That's what happens when you eat too many power cubes.
---
But downvotes on bot comment shows that I'm right
---
hmm I don't know, maybe because you teamed?
---
What exactly
---
W
---
O
