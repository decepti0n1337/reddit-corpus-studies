Bibi

5880 health (4200 lvl 1)
---
1960 damage (1400 lvl 1)
---
120 degree attack angle (exceeds Frank and Poco)
---
Range: ~3.5 tiles
---
Special ability: large knockback on first hit
---
Super: Unknown

---
Seems like it's gonna just be another Rosa 2.0 =(

---
disgrace to 13 year olds
---
maybe that was a bit too harsh
---
It’s been addressed the last few times it’s been out
---
tHE MECH CHARACTER IS NAMED A. VA I'M WHEEZING
---
At the end of the day, one good synced push gets you the win in most scenarios
---
Autowalk? U mean when u walk to wall it goes to side? 
---
Your joystick probably is about 1° to that direction
---
You sure you're 13?
---
You seem 8. Go onto Facebook or something to complain
---
Who, probert or The game leader?
---
The Carl one at least half as good as Gedi-Kor’s skins, and the Maple Brock
---
I think this skin looks just ok, kinda disappointing considering the fan made ideas we've seen such as Viking Ship Carl, Detective Carl and Bathtub Carl
---
Rosa was nerfed individually, meaning other brawlers who could have been changed were ignored, additionally it’s still blatant that Rosa is at the top, so nothing in just said that as invalid.
---
Also I remember the video being made around the end of beta - early global, not sure which one exactly. But before you start crying, supercelll themselves explained why they are and choose to be a small team https://supercell.com/en/our-story/
---
Poor counter argument, ignores evidence, horrible reflection on yourself. Already debunked all your points, though you may feel free to try again.
---
Poor poco
---
I think that maybe it will be 150 if his pickaxe is replaced with the steering wheel as a special attack.
---
Yea I drew it in 1 hour😂 thanks for the support
---
Well all know this
---
550 Powerpoints.
---
He needs a buff
---
Luck is on point
---
Thanks
---
woah buddy calm down
---
i mean, yeah, but i see more mortis spampost than leon tbh
---
dont mean to sound mean but no one cares and posts like these although with good intentions are ruining this sub
---
S-Class hero meaning it could be a legendary? lol ik that's a reach but still...
---
Yup, exactly u aren’t at higher trophies where higher skill cap brawlers are also beast

this is heavily underrated

What is VO
---
If it gets more updates we might just want to switch to that game
---
Cheers bro
---
I love the idea, 5v5 3v3 game modes but supercell is gonna have to work something out with the lobby to have 5 on the same team. Communication with this map will be key because a team could sneak up behind the enemy for a surprise, bolt spawns will have to be changed and
---
Lmao Love these videos😂😂 Thank you can you do crow?? And also why are they blurry ??
---
Tbh its a ripoff but the character design is on point
---
Forgot to respond to u btw when u said u were gonna make another Hope you get more upvotes!
---
There’s literally an entire post topic about this, it autowalks in whichever direction you walk in (some of the time, as it’s very wonky) linearly at a 90• angle. 
---
Unlike other games that allow you to glide along walls and give you a world of more movement options, this moves for you; left or right, and if you go against it, it slows you down and can cost you many battles where walls are involved.
---
It’s absolutely atrocious when fighting along say, cactuses or one-block walls as it constantly moves you, and not at all always in the direction you want to move. This is a broken mechanic which needs a fix, nothing wrong with the player’s movement.
---
To add on, considering what you said about “1*” degree, if that were the case logically you’d move in that 1* degree direction, but you don’t. It turns you 90• in that direction (and again, doesn’t always work).
---
Yea
---
Trying to make it a chain
---
Haha. So enlighten us on how it works.
---
Spike has a skin, and Carl just got one from this update.
---
As they are working on the previous brawlers I mentioned, they probably dont have time nor artists working on the new brawlers.  They don't have a team of unlimited people.
---
Same dude
---
Lmao, so?
---
Good shit man.
---
Thanks! Your suggestion is much appreciated!
---
Ok
---
Bottom half is every solo showdown match
---
wow i like it, keep going 💪🏽
---
Perhaps the super could work like the Lumby’s rage in Clash Royale - a DPS boost for a limited time.
---
Can u please make Carl’s skin 30 gems
---
it was my bad i'm sorry
---
Holy fuck bro. You dropped from 220 to 176
---
Aww shit, here we go a--- NEW BRAWLER NEW BRAWLER GUYS DID YOU HEAR NEW BRAWLER BIBI SHE'S SO F***ING NOT ON MY GOSH GUYS LOOK SHE HAS A FACE ON HER BAT WOWWWWW
---
Yeah that sounds reasonable
---
New meme template

As a Canadian, I need that maple barley

Sir, can you draw bake sale barley next?

But wait, there’s more! I don’t have a different device! Ahah!.... wait... oh.

Satisfying*
---
That’s a good reveal. That if the update is this Monday she’ll be out Friday. Noice
---
See down voting my post bcoz it's true zzzz NOOB
---
wow every animations takes so long i won't watch th whole thing
---
What is the super and when is the update hitting
---
She's hot AND OP.
---
Aw shit, here we go again.
---
Other than Jessie ;) 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I once lagged and spammed super button, turret got me #1
---
How would this sub fit in this comment?
---
Epic or mythic. Her mechanics are too unique to be a lower rarity.
---
B.O.B = Bringer of Bats ;D
---
We only see one earring, but is possible that her other earring is a minus and she has some magnetic or electric attack, but we already have jessie so I don’t know.
---
they are cool at the end or you want every day new skin
---
If only there was a way to tell people to fall back usually When I have to be Gem Carrier I let my team  do the heavy lifting when I have 8 gems
---
In French she’s called Polly
---
I would say grrrrrrrrrr
---
Get downvoted scum
---
and is showing her belly
---
Ono for sure cuz that's all they'll have time to say before they get assassinated
---
I use Easy Paint Tool SAI ;)
---
A surprise, but a welcome one for memists.
---
Lmao even the icons for health, attack, and super are the same. Super icon is just a cat instead of a skull.
---
Nerf black guy
---
I find this hilarious.😂
---
Indeed.
---
Leon, Gene, Rosa, Probably Bibi...they all get nerfs after release, because they start out a bit stronger than balance would require.
---
Wouldnt that make her short range even more of a liability though
---
So good
---
aw shit here we go again (nice. im not mocking ya)
---
What does this mean
---
I love it when people have matching names. 😂
---
Gene? Are u seriously? Gene was arguably worst brawler in the game upon release
---
Why do people cover up the names... There's no point.
---
Is that even possible
---
Or a green haired wierdo with psychic abilities
---
Don’t forget not really table has huge wind up and has bad burst dmg
---
I agree....
---
THIS IS AMAZING. Sadly with the way the post is formatted you can't see the picture on the app unless you click on the post.
---
I kinda agree that Leon isn’t that good, but still, Crow still isn’t great on 3V3, but is a beast on SD. I still think Leon is better than Crow, but that’s just me
---
Russian
---
i see you haven't got a legendary. Are you high trophy with no leggy or low trophy grinder?
---
?
---
Yeah, but the only difference is that it’s limited to only nine months.
---
After that, you’d need a knot
---
"atack range is bigger than my future"
---
Ok true
---
Nope. It's her mechanic. Her star power hasn't officially been revealed

Love the AoT format

Probably cause it is😁 Thanks for support!

Removing the mustache is the stupidest move ever. It looks fine.

You sound like you have an avocado as a brain...

That Darryl was trolling so bad
---
After my 3rd death by Leon, I would have just called it a day and go to sleep
---
Thank you
---
You need to actually take legal action, somebody stole ur intellectual property, u can't just tell people u have to file a dmca complaint
---
Searched for Leon to see if he's worth $35 dollars. (I ended up deciding my money is better saved lol)
---
Was playing as Jessie without powercubes and somehow killed a 6 powercube Leon that was low and went invisible👍
---
Thank you. My friends been staring at me for teen minutes now wondering why I'm laughing like a frigging madman.

He’s extra scared because he knows Mortis already got ahold of Barley ;)
---
Do you mean character balancing? And it's not like that in the current state of the game there's a super powerful op character
---
On Twitter Brawl stars asked who should they remodel and tara is the winner
---
Id name it smiley : )
---
You clearly haven’t played long enough to understand just how powerful all the legendaries are. The rarity does not determine how good they are just the chance of getting them. get oneshot by leons and spikes and tell me they dont do enough damage lol. Trust me you dont want a tanky crow or leon or spike it will ruin the game.
---
Bo watched you sleep that night
---
Frank is the man
---
That auto-aim Bo looking OP🔥
---
So you haaveee... Wth??? 0.00001 dollars????
---
Piper and Bake sale barley would be a great friendship xd
---
F
---
I dunno, windup seems to make it more balanced, and the knockback takes a full two seconds of not attacking WITH full ammo to activate
---
The spin was worth it
---
Lolol this had me dying
---
Rico or Ricochet
---
Star power is a massive boost with full ammo, check Kairos video
---
Is there something wrong with the image? I just read that I was posting it a bit weirdly, so that might be the problem. I'm sorry if it was confusing!
---
Got it. An excuse to ruin brawlers and to draw
---
Headass
---
F for boi
---
Did you watch the video? The attack has lag, meaning it takes a while for you to attack again. And the 1960 damage is probably because bibi is at the max lvl, since the video shows Bibi has star power. You just gotta believe in the devs for a sec.
---
We need paladin piper

First skin I've seen for Bibi, and i love it! 10/10.

So true.
---
Just have a look on the top side of the opponents safe.
---
She is faster than a lot of brawlers making it impossible to escape when you use Brock, penny, shelly etc

+ defaullt skin

If thay add a fourth ability to every brawler It would be amazing

play with randoms once in awhile

This is why you don't auto aim
---
Even the game mode names are same.Like Heist and Bounty,Gem grab is smash and grab.
---
Tottaly agree and people just say I suck woth mprtis in the right hands he is deadly but he still meeds a buff come on supercell
---
What was her ult in the datamine
---
Hey
---
Ehre.
---
Then play with bot everyone encounter something like this..why u r n so much frustration .and it's not all about internet it's about supercells servers too
---
It was like a huge bomb that split into smaller shells
---
Kinda like Spike's super
---
It wasn't that specific they only datamined a few sentences
---
WHAT IS THATTTTTT!?!?!?!?!?!?
---
A few people modified the game files and posted it to Reddit yet supercell did not take down theit videos.
---
It’s the same guy? Didn’t realize I was reposting lol
---
I think they are just crossdressing
---
Rosa is clearly not overpowered enough
---
Your content is by far the laziest I’ve ever seen,most of the pose videos you do make brawlers look like they been smoking crack or snorting smack or some shit 
---
In all honesty you deserve to get terminated

I have all the trophy road brawlers,rares and super rares,now if I open a mega box is there any chance getting any epic ones?

lmao
---
Here is Bibi stats at level 1:
---
Damage:1400 
---
Health:4200
---
Super:unknown but I have a Guess Her super is:She is gonna ride her bike and you control it And has a time duration of 6 seconds and if you hit an enemy it damages and knocks back him and you are gonna be out of the bike 
---
Star power:When Bibi has her yellow bar full she will move faster
---
Sorry for my bad language
---
U do realise there have been other Youtubers who do it, yet their channels are still there right? Even then his older videos without that were still striked
---
This is why brawl stars is a unfair and awful game , fix this game or every one will notice the garbage in this , an they will leave!!!
---
Are you aware of the lore the game used to have? It was pretty cool. If you're curious, you should check it out. It was the main description of every brawler and one day in an update supercell randomly removed it sadly...
---
“Lucille” - Negan’s bat from Walking Dead

umm lenny is already in the game

Lenny=Penny's cannon

Like I said to the teamers in the title for this post. GET OUT OF MY GAME.

that isn’t a skin man, skins are an addition to a base model. brock is the base, and can *be changed* by adding a skin to him.

How do I unsee this....
---
So you buy big boxes before u even use shelly?
---
Hey you don't need to respond that way just cuz you dont like a map design.
---
Too bad that is not her star power if you watch the brawl talk carefully, you will realised that no matter how much health bibi has, her damage is still the same. There is still another reason but who cares.
---
I have 19 brawlers at 7k experience level is at 100 what is wrong with my luck

There was a DynaMike at 00:49 lol

:D 🔫

Theres people with all level 1 brawlers at 500 trophies. These arent hackers, they're extremely skilled players who are doing a challenge.
---
I can’t find any details for the strike, apart from just “copystriked by Supercell Oy. No emails, nothing.
---
What about the chicken.
---
Simon and carfunkel is a real thing. Supercell just made a play on words. Seriously how could you think just cuz they did that it meant simon was gonna be a brawler.
---
scary we dont even know her super
---
Don't vote beg bro, especially about bovine excrement. Milk is pus and cow juice, not for people. It bad for you

---
#WHAT ABOUT ME ?!?!?!?!?!??
---
Do you wonder what is the second Sneak Peek?
---
it’s not chill
---
You can watch some of the youtubers video on Bibi and they tell you all about her super. It’s scary because you should be able to chain it really well and it only takes 3 hits to charge.
---
the old maps look horrible. what have they done to calamity canyon and hole of the mole king
---
This is what I said 2d ago
---
Buff Mortis!
---
"Spy sappin' MAH turret"
---
I said his face looks like peely's face from s8 battle pass
---
nah i think brawlstars copied this game
---
thanks man
---
I realise i was wrong, and I apologize for spreadsing misinformation. But it still believe that as a higher-up in Supercell, that he should be acting more maturely
---
i actually like this skin its pretty stereotypical but cool
---
But still
---
colt. shelly, bull, and el primo would reck her
---
NO COMMENT...
---
I got a Star Power from the 7k Megabox, pushed really hard last night for it because Season Reset, IT WAS SLICK BOOTS!😭
---
Thank for helping me winning a bet
---
i’d tap her... wait wha-....
---
I can't tell 
---
It is the same picture
---
Agreed
---
Pretty true indeed. I bought Crow this weekend and I feel NO urge to push him past 400 yet. The fun really diminishes once you got all brawlers at 500, since there really isn't a reason to play. Pushing past 500 is the least rewarding thing ever
---
No... just stop
---
Wheres the story mode? Dissapointed
---
I'm not the greatest programmer ever (I used C#, but I lost interest some time ago). Considering how quickly they made the Rosa nerf after the community's outcry, it's clear that they quickly nerfed her a little bit in an attempt to balance the game.
---
Spike doesn't have a gender
---
next week... you should know by now.. just bcz we got a sneak peek doesn’t mean we get the update right away... maybe in 2 days or a week just wait lol
---
whats with that pen lol, is it home made or did you buy it because i'm interested
---
Hoo Lee sheet
---
You're right, my b. But he should still be acting more maturely.
---
Has she been released
---
balance changes are easy, but a whole now update. Phew
---
omg ur  stoopid... plz tell me ur being sarcastic
---
Because it’s really low effort and not conductive to any real discussion.
---
where did you find it?
---
I think shelly did good, just that Rosa f*cked up like 3 times.
---
Oh no
---
Kinda disappointed her bangs don’t cover her eyes like in the trailer
---
I actually used to play this before i knew brawlstars existed since it came before global release
---
I am happy too... The developer community is doing pretty good... And I am really want to support them... Maybe one day, I want to have a job there.
---
If Supercell isn’t going to give her a voice for that reason, they should at least tell us that so we don’t have to keep wondering
---
crap rosa is nerfed now im switching to bibi

Yes officer, this comment right here

I would say Darryl needs another skin for the most part. He has none or maybe even bo
---
They are both named spike, lol
---
Basebibi XD
---
Do you think it will be free and given to everyone not just Canadians as it’s celebrating the soft launch
---
This is cursed

aaaahhhh its soooooo cute

But when update?

The attack is wrong I think it was 1960 in brawl talk

Poco now sings desfasito

They turn to coins

Bo is currently suffering

yep

^new pfp time
---
Yikes that train rail

Goooo ahead~
---
Why piper buff? Are you want to be able to do a lot of damage from close range with her?
---
She should be hugging her dad colt
---
JESSIE CUTE
---
These are not the droids your looking for
---
It is a map for me
---
Yay Gumballs
---
&gt;if anyone gets close to her she’s already dead
---
That's what her super is for, to run away. Piper isn't meant to be play on close combat, in long range combat she basically a goddess.
---
For her reload speed, i agree that her reload is the slowest in the game right now. But i kinda understand because if she get a reload buff, that means she would be OP.
---
No we don’t want anymore. Soon they nerf us Leon’s again
---
But Loaded Rico is better than Gold Ricochet
---
how can you have spike emotes without a happy one. 😂 these a cool though
---
Lmao now I can’t unsee it.
---
Idk other gamemodes
---
I think we need an option to add boxes to a special safe, where you could save the boxes, even from the shop.
---
Yup , Rosa explains a lot, cause all brawlers see her as super fighter but she sees others as trash can.
---
I Can't imagine how long this took
---

It's more about the broken bushes and blocks
---
Wow too sad it's gone now, let's hope it will be back, frank wanted to add some old maps and remove some new ones, let's hope for the best.
---
So they’ve released a rare, super rare, epic, and mythic now. Which means they will realease another legendary I can’t get soon.
---
I play since global release and I got Crow and Leon in 2~3 months
---
I have 9k and no Mortis 
---
(Global release / f2p)
---
A week -&gt; 10 hours -&gt;  about 2 hours per day.
---
No Piper buff?
---
You dindt find it, you just stole it from Echlips
---
What ball is that
---
Are you dumb?
---
I guess you've been luckier than me. I've also been playing since global and I'm missing Crow, Spike, Tara, and Gene. 
---
(7k, f2p)
---
Or 69 LMAO XD RAWR.
---
Knew it, They added a new legendary, mythic, super rare and rare, it'd only make sense to add another epic.
---
op
---
😂😂
---
Like seriously, that knockback mechanic is gonna knock the ball from another brawler
---
Haha. So cool bro, I think this js the first skin I saw from you facebook posts
---
she shoots a massive chewing gum bubble with like 30 range
---
Bo was in the game since the start and got his remodel "recently". Im sure they are working on el Primo or Tara remodels and we will get one of them on the next months. 
---
And remember that Mortis and Bo's remodels got a lot of hate when they were released and maybe Supercell's team are afraid that could happend the same with Tara and el Primo.
---
Team up, kill all rosas, back to our original scheduled program
---
They made a mariarchi sound like a teen in a school's music club, with absolutely no reference to the culture he originated from whatsoever, not to mention the mediocre voice acting. It could've been done so much better.
---
Killing them off in the mourschwitz (mortis+Auschwitz)
---
Cuestion. Wheres simon???
---
He's annoying and unfunny for the sake of being annoying and unfunny. If that was their goal they succeeded *way* too much.
---
I don’t think we’re ever going to be in a spot in which they can produce a new brawler weekly
---
Yeah well i cant deny that😂
---
*SO MUCH MONEY, SO LITTLE PLACES TO ROB*
---
Well Carl costed 59 with a discount so I’m guessing she’s going to be around the high seventies or low eighties
---
#LET'S UN COVER THE MYSTERY OF MONETARY
---
i hate it when i accidentally tape my big boxes too
---
Which rarity has Bibi?
---
Wow Leon didn't get nerfed this time. Hooray!
---
This looks like his old model
---
I know,but why would we get another legendary,there is still the trophy road rarity,and the more rare brawlers tend to appear less often(also if it is not trophy road there is still more chance it will be a mythic)
---
wow
---
Hooray now I can wait another 5 months to get her... at least I wont need to wait a year if she was a legendary
---
yeah she won the bet
---
 I like it.Brock would be good on this map
---
Gaki ni mottade manga be like.
---
pennies
---
Also stops siblings from MASS OPENING your boxes that took you 4 months to save.

Damn I came here to write exactly same thing! Bibi&amp;Batty

3's better

Yea, like mortis - he is women, right?! And spike looks like a girl completely.
---
M(Mortis) + Essie(Jessie) = Jessie
---
Nice! Keep the Tron skins coming!
---
I never said that
---
Great skin!
---
You know what El Primo does in gem grab right? He jumps in with all the gems and throws the game. This Bo is no different.
---
Agree, he doesn’t looks like female.

How to check tour pint
---
Stealing a shitload of gems from a safe?
---
Wow, i don't know about that. Thank u.
---
Auto aim shoots at the nearest visible target so because the primo was hidden darryl shot somewhere else
---
Vir-gen
---
Ah, I see you are a man of culture as well.
---
That's not what I actually meant 😅
---
this cant be all thats coming or else it would be total bs.
---
Sadness ;-;
---
I have 3d Model Images too!
---
Or Trophy Road.
---
Wow..This is awesome! Got most of the references( dragon ball ones are great!!)
---
Didn't really get the PvZ pea shooter one though. Explain that someone!
---
Truly epic design of brawler, i cant wait for it!
---
Crap... I need to rewatch meet the pyro... Forgot all phrases
---
Thank you ! Good idea, I had not paid attention to that, I was more focused on the aesthetic side ^^
---
It’s basically Hall of the Mole King (Suckier Version)
---
But they probably prefer that one person does both the 3d modelling and design
---
What is cupa
---
In actuality, Bull wouldn't be able to lay a finger on Crow.
---
pushback mechanic which stops most of the brawlers and doesnt require nor charged super nor star power, very fast movement (sp) and reload speed, pretty good dps and hp, wide attack that can go through thin walls and really long super range. what else does a brawler need to be overpowered? i just hope that she wont be as strong as rosa was 🤷‍♀️
---
Or did her the bet win?
---
Sniper Kirby, Hammer Kirby 2.0, Bat Kirby and... ummm. Mechanic Kirby?
---
I ship Crow and Bibi
---
I got more than twice his trophies and still not 1 legendary or mythic THIS GAME IS BS!
---
love to see this in game
---
So??
---
lmao piper thinks of Poco as free bounty points
---
with balls
---
God damn it his is outlet luck no matter how many trophies
---
same here
---
I got everyone except the legendairies before the 3000 soooo.
---
I didn't spend money tho.
---
Night witch mortis actually igm

# LET'S FIGHT AN EPIC BATTLE
---
I’m so mad I bought that golden Barleyi want this master piece
---
Is this a reference to something ? Otherwise this just seems random
---
every match be like
---
Exactly.
---
It's called a rickroll.
---
I think we will not see a lot of lvl 10 Bibi for some days after her release
---
What
---
Helping
---
Oh, but Bull and Carl have their supers so, uh.
---
Where did you hear it?
---
No, you still have to wait some weeks
---
Yeah that super is just too op
---
Piper = PewDiePie ? o_O
---
Oh right i didnt realise im not too enthused about saws😂
---
How about just Baseball Bibi? She has a BAT.
---
Yea you can see OJ’s vid of Bibi which includes the VO of rosa
---
If you think like that you will never improve
---
To be honest, even tho they are obvious copies, the animations look really good.
---
Final shot would propably be the only possibility. If doing damage gave benefits, most people would just sit in the corner and damage each other to get rank
---
You forgot the Rosa killing you.
---
SKINS MAKE THE GAME P2W
---
from what I understood from the guy above
---
Tbh i think the nerf was a bit too much
---
Please mercy fucking scary jessie
---
What are you complaining about
---
Well then, in that case ima just play for fun i guess. Thats what video games are for right?
---
Na its trash
---
Fr fr
---
Press X to doubt.
---
But wait! Oh f\*\*k the gate is locked!
---
I have two superespeciales to unlock but I unlocked  Leon
---
I'd like to see a Goblin Brawler El Primo skin!
---
brawl-a-rama would be epic
---
Same, cus the other one is just like the boss robot. So boring and not something new.
---
Aah,miss this show.
---
I HATE IT
---
r/ComedySeizure
---
Add a /s next time.
---
Ouch, hoping she was a trophy road
---
r/technicallythetruth
---
You know... a skin comes with a change of character most of the time, or do you think Darius from League actually plays on the NBA?
---
Ok sure, i agree with your point above completely, [but the matchmaking isnt exactly balanced.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/azezbh/brawl_stars_matchmaking_is_amazing/) which means you might end up fighting brawlers 4 levels above yours. This doesnt change much in leon's case, though
---
Well Negan is a boy
---
yeah man I HATE ppl who are teaming in solo showdown...no skill...only teaming
---
That’s for low trophies
---
What the f@$% WHY
---
I have the squishiest brawler that can be easly one shot by almost every single brawler in the Showdown meta rn
---
To record the replays anf post them? How else is he going to post his replays
---
Looks like bibi, change my mind
---
Definitely yes
---
It's strange that she looks different in the video than in the game, maybe they didn't want to spoil it.
---
Yes, but actually no
---
+ make it for password cause brothers are really making me yell loud
---
So it will add up to 105.8% which is ~bullshit~ quite dumb.
---
👍🏻
---
Dyna sees Pam as T-Series.
---
so fking frustrating
---
Really cute!
---
Im calling the cops
---
Add humor flair
---
hey look i didn't like the new update but there's no reason to say uncalled-for shit like this bud
---
Oke
---
Worse, they miss it
---
Leon
---
But why I don't understand this
---
Crowgang for life 😤😤
---
Died from a poison before it hits you 👌
---
That was a 3v3. Dynamike wouldn't stand a chance in solo showdown.
---
Not without teaming.
---
I see the  Rico piper ship
---
Pam: am I a joke to you?
---
Maybe) but I from Russia and it’s our patriot female Russian suit. Sorry, my english(
---
I felt sad because I upset you , so I just deleted 🤗
---
Shelly and Dynamike....
---
.....getting nerfed?
---
Are you high?
---
One thing that makes me mad about having a friend with a legendary is how they ALWAYS try to use on every mode but end up losing -100, my friend’s Leon is at 173 because I was helping him fix his trophies earlier.
---
I know how you feel i got like lava hounds
---
Legendaries are normal and she has a special attack pattern and is epic? Wtf supercell
---
Or he just didn't open boxes? WAIT THEN HOW DID HE MAX THE CHARACTERS, I take my words back
---
r/woooosh
---
It's literally too much work to look at this shit
---
So penny sees penny as penny. Good one.
---
😂😂lol!!!
---
When is the update
---
At first I thought you used Bull’s charge at the 32 second mark.
---
Great!
---
the Carl and Barley one is good, why do you complain?
---
No u survive with 100hp after the poison is over
---
Thr hair look like ~~karen~~ bibi
---
Rosa in general needs to be removed. She doesn’t fucking die.
---
I've just unlocked him and am getting why you say so lol
---
epic
---
Ikr
---
lavaloon
---
I literally opened up like 70 the other night before I knew they were releasing a new brawler fml
---
I got my first epic at 3400 thropyes 😒
---
I feel you it's so frustrating...
---
Rule34: Exists
---
İ Got to not open box LİKE 2 week and 70 box
---
Ummm you can with a clash royale question now you out here with og clash of clans attacks😂

Thank you man!

How long did this frickin take this deserves more credit a lot more
---
Thats a really nice skin and beatiful
---
Thank you!
---
ok but i have a question
---
why is everyone bringing up r34 in every art post
---
Copyright
---
I really really want to make a joke on police brutality and Brock but it wouldn't be proper.
---
Stay right where you are! This is the Reddit Police and you may get temporarily banned if this repost comes from Instagram!
---
Yeah like the old module.
---
I dont believe you
---
Thanks😁
---
Its only trophies from brawlers
---
If you want it in the game vote for it on MAMM here!
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/bqt2v6/comment/eo8by5i

This girl deserve at least ONE skin...
---
Ikr people keep saying that despite that it wouldn't fit with her.
---
for americans its 94
---
a well balanced map with no modifiers and you're complaining?
---
New subreddit! r/tooluckybutidontcare

maybe a drone?🤔🔥

Actually thats primo’s kid being born
---
its like 5 above average
---
Why is it 400 trophies tho?
---
I've created one Gem Grab map this week. Here it is:
---
1.  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/bqzt2c/new\_map\_idea\_vertical\_boost/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/bqzt2c/new_map_idea_vertical_boost/) 
---
it's called "Vertical boost".
---
Its Darryl
---
neither does leon  
---
can we get f's for tara and leon  
---
i don't even have either of those why do i care about this so much
---
Haha more or less🔥
---
Mainly SD and duo SD. Yes it is more exciting for top players to have such big amounts of spectators now. But it is annoying as f for people like me 😂Brawl Tv is dead to me 😅
---
0 you have all legendary 🤣🤣🤣🤣
---
Frank should've stunned her while he had the chance
---
Imgflip.com
---
What’s the character in barley for Darrel from?
---
Did you make a post just to show what rarity Bibi is?
---
Getting 1k upvotes?
---
r/lootstars
---
could be🤣🔥
---
Developers of brawl stars are messed up.
---
This will promote people spam creating accounts to get inflate the chances of getting legendaries to feed their mains
---
Ya
---
It would be my dream! Anyway thanks man!
---
Replays
---
Spike
---
What about her mom Pam?
---
you say?🤣
---
this is actually the cutest thing i've ever seen

Ugh what do you want

that would be epic
---
i unironically want this
---

---
tfw no Jessis
---
i'd buy that tbh
---
He’s a cucumber if you take the spikes off
---
We don’t know exactly how much speed Bibi gains with her star power, but if I had to guess it brings her up to Crow/Tier, which is nothing to laugh at. 
---
Her star power is like Colts but better, except it isn’t always active, and I like that.
---
What? How do you know
---
yes officer, this comment here
---
Lmao you don’t even give evidence just say I’m bad. I have mortis rank 18 ok.
---
lewder\*
---
Mobile legdnds team Aether rifht?
---
tbh the starpower is the same as colt: not bad in any way, but not game-breaking at the same time
---
Where is filthy Frank?
---
To all the people saying Shelly is hot. Get this, She is a kid. I hear FBI already coming.
---
Broo, are you gonna make another dataminate
---
Thank you man!🔥🔝
---
have you not seen the huge update coming to brawl stars yet??
---
Hi. I've created one Gem Grab map today, down there you have link to it.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/br072l/new_map_idea_v2_vertical_boost/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
Remembet to down/upvote
---
Bad design actually, sorry
---
🤣🔥
---
Mortis sees Colt as lag.
---
*Nice*
---
Carl is trash without his star power. But with his star power he was OP so I would only nerf his star power
---
The horror
---
But crow counters close range brawlers
---
No one knows it’s not the full list
---
Just like the April update?
---
rarity doesnt not determine strength.. that would be pay to win
---
Leon isn’t mysterious but I still think he should be silent because he’s a stealth assassin.
---
“Wow. That sucks.” -that last poco you killed
---
Bad idea.
---
The second one look like hes pulling his pants down, im sorry
---
He isn't that bad in siege,can collect the bolts and counter them squishy bois
---
Ass loving never gets ridiculous
---
But... the gate leads outside of the area. The robots are supposed to be made inside, are they not?
---
no way 😂
---
insert obligatory night witch mortis joke
---
No one beats the bull!!
---
Maybe you have a point fellow butt lover. How do you prefer your preference?
---
Not every thrower teams
---
Racist
---
yes please
---
The jumping pads are useless on the Brawl Ball map! Don’t add them just to look good, otherwise you won’t have any chance
---
Agreed. Having a more balanced person would make the game seem less pay to win and attract more players, who may eventually spend money on the game.
---
no if this true poco will be the worst brawler
---
Hello brother
---
Seriously Pepsi??
---
Oofst
---
Mortis needs buff
---
They don’t fight they team
---
Yes.
---
True Story , this hapends to anyone
---
Let him alone
---
Yep, my thoughts exactly. I couldn't emphasize it that much :P
---
Thats perfectly normal imo, i got my first epic at 6k lol
---
Y chinese people?
---
SAY WHAAA
---
*how to get banned off reddit 101*
---
Тебе её не дадут лол
---
i dunno, but I think his map looks cool. Btw, do you know how the choose the weekly winner?
---
Lol that el primo
---
Am I the only one who thinks that Carl is in the real position. Without his star power of course
---
This post summarizes why I don't push any Brawler. Trophy Road Rewards aren't good enough and the stress isn't worth it. All my Brawlers are at 300 or less trophies and my total trophies is slighty over 5200.
---
yep. my thoughts exactly
---
Piper is one of the worst brawler right now, if not THE worst
---
Night witch igm
---
Yyyyyyesss
---
Also, r/woooosh
---
I hate to break it to you but these days this is the norm 😤
---
Bull's accent is obviously a New York/New Jersey accent.
---
I wonder why no one has thought of Baseball Bibi-
---
\*GEDI-KOR has joined the chat\*
---
???
---
You can’t blame supercell for people being bad at the game.
---
u can tell because he gave el  primo a main attack range nerf. i bet he doesnt play brawl stars
---
Because the cactus is more fun to play.
---
Damn, he’s good.
---
He was either taking a dump or slacking off (sorry Ryan)
---
s b e v e
---
I think it was because we were using 600 brawlers so barely anyone online in our region at the time could even match up against us.
---
Carlio kart
---
The reason why Mortis is kind of good in Heist is because a lot of people use throweres.
---
This is amazing!
---
oh my, how long did you take to make this
---
I require the full image, do not resist
---
That would make sense
---
Not everyone is good at the game. How's that hard to understand?
---
Sure!
---
^This. I completely agree. What Supercell needs to do is separate showdown trophies from 3v3s trophies.
---
Yes
---
Wrong...
---
He looked more like a gravedigger before, and less like... a magician
---
somebody tell me the pun in Bibi pls
---
~50000
---
She is , with Rosa
---
Can people shut up about Tara? She has to have a remodel for there to be skins
---
This is racist
---
Tbh this needs more upvotes
---
Because she is the worst
---
There was an attempt.
---
Disco Barley is fire though
---
Come on dear critic, where is your idea and drawings?
---
Maybe they don’t spend all day playing this game you loser
---
It was a rethorical question.
---
Press F to pay respects
---
Rosa doesn’t have voice
---
u/donghonisugly2 you need to put and extra o in u/Donghoon so it would be u/Donghoonisugly2
---
Woah! Hey Bull, Come get your sis. Actually naw I got this. Ok let’s get are hands on her one time first.
---
bruhh that's what im saying
---
I'm pretty sure that the bomb inside the cannon exploded thus exploding all the other bombs inside.

---
Hahah, not much else he could've done. Sucks for you tho
---
Wait is this actually a method to get legendaries?
---
Damn It! I was just about to post this.
---
Mmmmmm piper needs a buff
---
She should speak a mysterious language that nobody understands
---
like french or something
---

---
Didn’t rosa just get nerfed
---
Bruh
---
He wasn’t about to die with no kills
---
Easy fix, the robot will come out of the gates but it will first go to the ike for assembly and then it would officially spawn and start moving around
---
What?
---
Am I joke to you you little ... ?
---
Wait stop right there myself
---
Make sense to me -cit
---
Sometimes you’re out of ammo so you use your super ball so you don’t risk anything. Cause who knows, maybe a shelly with super will respawn.
---
#u/donghonisugly2 you need to put and extra o in u/Donghoon so it would be u/Donghoonisugly2
---
Make it so that a partially constructed robot comes out of the gates and it'll get fixed up at the ike or just refueled or something
---
Carl and Rosa SUPER needs to be a longer duration
---
I DIDNT SEE THE VIDEO!!! HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO KNOW??!!!
---
thank you kind sir
---
deal with it
---
How the heck Rico is nervous sweating
---
Yes, agreed. I opened a bunch of boxes last time I was saving them :(
---
its true. bentimm showed a video
---
Literally everyone is talking about El Primo and not the IKE
---
Ninja is the best
---
Yeah scott!
---
Yes same thing for me
---
Her super unleashes a giant bouncing ball, it can hit same enemies several times and has a rolling range of Darryl’s old super
---
But supercell just wants everyone to p2w...
---
you're not looking to good urself there
---
What’s your trophy count wth him
---
holy fuck man I never saw her with her super jesus
---
Sounds kind like how op Rosa was at release...
---
Boss bot is a bad skin I don’t care if it’s gedi kor
---
This is just teaming. Don't do it.
---
The Retropolis update will probably be available tomorrow or sometime later this week but we won't know **for sure** when Bibi is released until she is visible in-game and we can see the release timer.
---
id say +300
---
Hey! Rosa sees crow as my profile picture! Lol
---
Nice
---
so we should nerf leon again because you dominate with him also??
---
depends if you have a brawler in mind you want to upgrade and have the gold to upgrade said brawler
---
Shelly is actually super adorable
---
🅱️
---
what happens after? do you guys backstab?
---
His super will be him spinning while spewing fire/smoke from out of his car's muffler
---
I’m honored you found my post and account good enough to copy, but *why* exactly?
---
The effort you put behind each one is awesome
---
thanks bro
---
Yes it's been happening for a week or two
---
i guess he throws a jack
---
But Piper?.. 😭
---
My friend is the original rawr I just made this account cause I was bored and wanted to see what happened if I just stole there post I’m deleting this account now
---
Dkin
---
Old darryl + Frank = Bibi, sounds better
---
Is*
---
yeah or be more careful on what slot you invite him on
---
69th upvote! I laughed out loud 😂
---
At the range I play (500-750 trophies) it’s usually very easy to avoid a shot especially in that way. The biggest issue is that if a piper jumps I will shoot their landing zone if it’s within line of sight, this is especially easy on brock because he has significant travel time on his rockets, and even if it’s out of LOS he can use his own ult.
---
Outift he loop
---

No she doesn’t. I play at 500-800 trophies.

Also, I’m my opinion, Colt is very hot, or at least hotter than Bull.

Issue is crows like to play like bull in low trophies
