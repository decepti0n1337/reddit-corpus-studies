Have you tried 3d modeling for supercell?

why are you complaining wtf.

that sounds really cool and id love to be a part of it

That's true. Darryl could get a buff in another area then to compensate maybe

Spike is the easiest to draw wth

Yep I've drawn Shelly and Colt hundreds of times so I'm used to draw them.. Also they are my favorites! Nita's costumes are so difficult..😰😰 This work took about 5 hours including sketch ;9

Subtle Leon flex
---
Wow dude :( but you have a point this is one of he reasons I want him to get a GIANT ULTRA buff like an attack damage buff and a reload speed buff
---
oof
---
If he had that much reload speed, he would be able to run any fights, he could go across the map within seconds... big no
---
colt skin is literally worst skin...
---
Hahaha that’s so funny 
---
IKR

THATS RELatable

😂😂🤣😂🤣🤣😂
---
Sure, dm me the code and I’ll join
---
Did you upload this to youtube?
---
You could join the Kairos Time discord. It shows people that want to play with a team (vocally or not) meaning you could get a good comp and good allies
---
It all depends on preference and what you like. Nita is a team player and often is used in 3v3 modes the most.
---
nope, but I'm going to record with whole body reveal for youtube soon! channel is same name as reddit username! :D
---
The only buff that i think he needs is the ability to glide the distance of his attack when he uses it towards a wall. I love mortis but that get’s me killed a lot or doesn’t let me close in the distance with enemies in maps with close corridors. 
---
What feels off the most is when you clip with the water edges and he just stops.
---
Yes. It proves my team sucks and I don’t.

Ask ashnflash to do it

Awesome, gotta put this on Listenonrepeat.com xD

What is el primo's reload speed again?
---
I think it's 1.5 seconds, but rosa is 1.2 seconds.
---
El Primo is the fastest in the game.  Faster than Rosa.
---
That same random after match: *LEAVE *

That saved my life :)

How fast IS el primo's reload speed?

Show me in numbers.

I'd rather kill!🤣 Anyway thanks bro🔥
---
What do you mean?
---
league players dont dis look like a PROJECT: skin
---
This post is literally the most unintelligent post i’ve seen on this sub. If mortis had the same reload speed as primo he’d be without debate the best and most OP brawler in the game. And people agree with this. That’s why
---
🤣🤣
---
Gotcha, thank you
---
ME: LOOKS AT ROCKS **AND** PLANTS!(I tend to enjoy science)

Could've been "Good question."

This is amazing! Super nice! Do it supercell!
---
It looks like it wore off when he did it, I'm gonna be replaying till I see if the invincibility wore off or not, which it more or so likely didn't wore off like you said.
---
Something I hear every day...
---
U should make it own version anyway, I'm pretty I'll look amazing. Keep on creating skins.

Thanks for the compliment dude🤩🔥

Wow, how did you managed to clone yourself and play the piano as one individual?! That's nuts
---
um I learned this by ear by listening to the game a couple of times- maybe you can find it online? otherwise, if I have time (which is unlikely, sadly) I may write it. thanks for the support tho! 😄
---
Because it stops the enemy's right in front of you so if you stand at a wall it will stop in the wall
---
wow
---
Yesss! (͡o ͜ʖ ͡o)
---
😄😄
---
Nah dude it should break the wall when a character passes into ones hitbox.
---
R u sure about that?A barly is targeting u and ur Low...Ye I think ur ded.
---
How about losing the star player (happened to me)
---
why genderbend when you can *b e n d* like a rubberband. a genderbent robot is just a robot
---
Wait does the ulti break walls?
---
Computer animation.. the stuff u see with animated kids movie, the hands playing the piano really look like 3d animation to me or maybe that 2 hour sleep last night is really getting to me lol
---
bravo my dude... As a fellow musician I can say that your piano skills are impressive
---
First wth? Why so agressive? Second,i don't have too. Third,i have seen 1.5Ks with lefendaries and mhyticals,don't cone sayinf that they spend cash becaue its still rare,i don't even have much blues,just Penny and Rico.

Not possible it was me!

I'll be sure to check it out! :)

They should give a special chest for every tenth time you get star player. I know Tanks A Lot is a clone, but there are some things it does very well.

ahhh?

1 Question
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
are you secretly a buttered piece of toast?
---
If you successfully grab someone and there are walls or bushes in the way of the path back to Gene, they will be destroyed, or at least SHOULD be, to prevent things like this.
---
The initial firing of Gene's super does not break walls/bushes though.
---
My friend actually got to insane III or more, I forgot
---
He dies before he can even hit his shots
---
i love this map because it is playable for both long range bralwers and tanks/shotgunners
---
Oh sorry didn't know
---
  
---
Last time I uploaded this a lot of people decided to hate on me because I posted my youtube channel in the comments.  
---
 I only posted this so people can see more of those video (since I cant upload 8 videos in 1 post on reddit) I do not make money with youtube and I already have a 1.5k subs channel so I do neither need attention  
---
 If you are planning on hating, it’s a waste of time

Wait I got it nvm

There are already like 500posts about this

Nope, she's even better now that she can assert dominance!

I feel like there has to be a subreddit better for this than r/cursedcomments , some sub about things that keep getting worse the more you scroll down, or look at them. Hmmm 🤔

Love the shadings on leon, yo udrew him so well!

I think she'd bribe the judge. Karen style

Well that makes more sense maybe let them level up for a couple weeks especially the 100 trophies guy a low level teammate can really hurt even if they are good
---
Ahahahaha... Ehehehe... Ohh...
---
colt, i guess! :D

Wow

It has Some 1-tile gaps, and SC doesn’t add maps with them because for Some reason you can’t fit through them before trying a trillion times.

yo why you steal my hard work

Thank you!

Thanks man🔥
---
Take the drink to get stronger, but what then? How do you win in this game mode? Also how do you get through the Teslas?
---
Clever.
---
I just drew spike leon and crow, you could check it out if you want ;)
---
i feel u man i have 4 brawlers like  that and i need help myself too lol
---
Rico and Piper were having fun trolling people
---
I met them as Pam and survived 3m, and I bet 10 tickets
---
I thought u like this line !!
---
r/lostredditors...?
---
I ordered them mostly based on the range of the white track when aiming, I didn’t account for the range of gene’s and spike’s split shots
---
Technically though, Jessie has the longest range when the her shot bounces
---
the way they played the game is so annoying
---
they followed you the entire game by doing nothing
---
when you spin with them, dont ever think you are safe, they probably will kill you in one second if they can
---
i mean there is not much you can do to stop those koreans
---
What is that super? Is it a one hit ko?
---
This is not his, this clip was created by a YouTuber name PinkFlower7, here is the original video: https://youtu.be/T3k0zHq9Lhk
---
the base brawl boxes are blue.
---
He is an A-tier and you want to buff him
---
Bunny penny is also a good one...popcorn rico too...
---
Funny but wrong
---
This looks so good I love it!
---
Well, that was a fucking lie.
---
Just join a good club and get two pro friends and get carried in brawl ball :)
---
Hi yes, when I got spike 3 weeks ago I watched lex and kairos tips. Spike can be really great on showdown you just have to play the long con. If you want some really in depth tips msg me and I’ll give u my disc.
---
Secret ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
nah this a spoiler get out
---
No brawler is useless at any power level. Plenty of level 1s with 500+ trophies. Also more trophies = better end of season reward.
---
Yup that them alright no one's  missing
---
4K Ultra HD
---
The ded piper shoulda been called blue
---
I do
---
I like how Chief Pat actually sucks so this made me laugh more than it should
---
I will do anything you want. I will even take off Rosa's gloves for you.
---
Weird flex but ok
---
They came at the same time and what,they are still nerfs
---
*Insert Icognito Tab Logo*
---
Lol
---
Holy shit you are unlucky
---
If you want I can give you tips on disc.
---
Welcome
---
Well that's..... that's actually a lot of boxes ;-;
---
Penny have more useless star power
---
F
---
Hey... Thats pretty good...
---
Thats your opinion but I like if they buffed one more tile
---
Wow this is really good
---
you really do have the balls on showing that you team on reddit
---
Thank you :))
---
It’s because they can’t makes skins for a brawler until they’ve been remodelled. I don’t think Tara in particular is desperate for a remodel, or at least not as much as, say, El Primo, but people want skins so ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
I can see the struggle of poco
---
Why tf you steal from pinkflower7 without crediy
---
 Thank you!
---
 So what are you talking about?
---
True af
---
Darryl's SP, same as Rosa's super, but weaker
---
Randoms
---
I get at least 6 minutes everytime I play Jessie.
---
Where’s the map?
---
do ticket modes put you on games with other players around your trophy level? I am at a decent trophy level yet i still only get players like an elephant
---
primo who gets stuck accidentally bc he used his super into a patch of wall while being chased by robots.
---
Okay this one is op
---
To Shiba Nita :)

I love spike

I killed rosa with super using frank.
---
Yeah, same. I opened 70 boxes, no Carl or Rosa.
---
Or they could just make solo ticket modes so everything doesn't have to rely on pure luck of getting good teammates
---
Well, tbh that’s why I’m chuckling rn.

Somehow, it would turn to 9v1
---
jessie is really good on robo rumble though? shes pam/bull tier lmao

Almost forgot about that part

I wonder why Double jump didn't work

not really I got a jessie random in rr 3 times in a row and all of them was at 5:5X which is good enough 30 tokens

Well 10 minutes ago i finally got pam, one of my favourite brawlers
---
I didn't know I needed this comment
---
You can hit multiple targets with the same attack and you have a turret, which you can heal. It's really not that hard to understand.
---
Hi i⁄(⁄ ⁄•⁄ω⁄•⁄ ⁄)⁄ i'm yo 1st fan.
---
So??
---
Samsung galaxy s6?
---
Maybe shes jealous
---
Okay ur not gonna heal ur turret so much so it stays alive even if just one boxer comes at u
---
26 toxic babies really matter to them lol
---
Available if you turn "show nsfw" on
---
Carl is inconsistent, but his reload speed is usually determined from a throw at his max range.
---
How could you? What level of boss did you fight?
---
I mean I have lost several times in Insane 4 but once I got double Pam it was an easy win. AND YOU GOT TRIPLE!
---
Dyna-Jump at that junkyard😂
---
I finally got Carl on friday, was so happy lol that was my first brawler in 3 months
---
Rosa can have infinite shields. Oh wait she can already do that
---
You don’t get the joke, do u? 😂🤦‍♂️
---
For sure!
---
Irmãoooo como assim Pam tá muito forte
---
it's a ukulele
---
I was thinking they used a map editor that could create this file automatically which they would share with Supercell.
---
If I knew how to make a website I'd make a map editor to do this, but I don't know how and I am probably not going to learn how for a while.
---
Just wait a few days.  I had it for four days before I could have a graph put together.
---
It means u haven't had Brawl Stats long enough.  I had it for 4 days before getting a graph.
---
This took thiccochet to a hole new level.
---
Flair doesn't check out
---
Well I had crow got spike and then 2 weeks later got a Tara and it dropped.
---
Imagine playing Poco/Rosa/Pam/Gene/Leon, OMFG. You wouldn’t be able to attack anyone.
---
Low effort, and bad presentation
---
Every brawler is a better choice than her. She has super low DPS.  She can do like 7000 damage then has to reload for like 9 seconds
---
r/woooooooooooooooooooooshwith21os for some reason

Yes

What the fuck have you just brought upon this cursed land

Thanks very muchhhh!!!
---
Out of all of the 3v3 gamemodes, the mechanics are the most  random and unfair.  There could be improvements like getting a Siege bot when u have 10 bolts or something instead of having to win a round.

this is from sonic's movie

Anyways it’s not like them to make assumptions.

Are not brawler ranks used in assigning 3v3 teams? In such way I can have i.e. nita rank 6 but only on 1st level 🤔

Lol it's wrinkles I swear XD

This sounds like a FatRat intermission now, neat

So which one are you?

Upvoted

jk NOPE

What did it cost?

His super shouldn't be able to charge on his own there's no reason he should get special treatment
---
Yeah, you need a percent sign or else it's 51%

Report them for being bad?

Why did you give me the name. Now I have to look just because of curiosity

You should have done -to

you accidently double posted this

It's good advice for randoms that complain about Primo being op.

Supercell probably added Rosa to make people stop complaining about Primo (which they shouldn't. Primo isnt even that strong).

*cough* carl *cough* rosa, I pushed back up to 12.7k so can you stop making false assumptions, I still don't know what you''re talking about though. I don't remember you and i believe it's toxic to go around calling others liars. and i'm not even saying shelly is trash primarily based on my own word, kairos and 20 other pros agree she is the weakest brawler in the game.

When colt starts thinking about shelly again...
---
Makes sense just dont understand why it doesnt also give you your trophies
---
Rosa gking destroyed showdown, its not fun to play anymore
---
I can understand though. He probably was panicking. Plus barley does a shit ton of damage too.
---
Hippie too op, Please Nerf
---
Well making a meme can be easy thanks to many apps
---
I would recommend you pic monkey
---
You can draw,and text in different fonts and also remove background from pictures to make your memes is easy to use 
---
Hope it helps :)
---
agreed
---
It's my favorite brawler haha
---
Thanks for the feedback! Yes, this is a clear drawback of my map, thanks for pointing it out) soon I will redo it. thank
---
no
---
You: Hey bull, got their piper?
---
Your bull: \*dies\*
---
\*Hear music and shotgun shot behind in the bushes\*
---
Aw hell naw
---
still the best looking &lt;3
---
Yep got it with the primo glitch
---
Cuz Nita and their barley had free reign on our safe. And barley does a lot of damage. And we only had piper defending haha
---
The dangers of eating mushrooms..
---
This is not r/crowgang
---
Oh litter. Google translator poop))
---
2 or 3 months
---
See you in hot
---
Here are some details:
---
* HP is the same as Pam
---
* Low damage is the same as Poco but 100 less
---
* High damage is the same as Mortis
---
* Super duration is the same as Rosa prenerf
---
* Reload speed should be low, simmilar to Darryl or Spike
---
* Super would take 4 high damage shots (7 low damage shots) to charge
---
Yeah, forgot to add stats details that balance him a bit
---
Thats basically what happens XD
---
Needs more JPEG
---
r/CrowGang is op
---
mortis w/o hat is big gae
---
r/CrowGang
---
NOOOOO.....Tara's voice should be badass. Like evil person.
---
First off, I hope you realize that 12.7k doesn't equal 13k. Simple math buddy.
---
Second, you are not even 12.7k, I know that for a fact. If you are gonna say that you're 13k, please send me a screenshot just so i know you aren't lying.
---
oh did you mean brawl ball?
---
But Crow is good man, he’s also really fun
---
Crow would charge up his super in an insane amount of time now that I think about it
---
Poco tries to kill the stealer but then gets primo supered
---
This is some serious quality post
---
wow! its smaller than barley bottle cap!
---
Removed. Rule 3. No providing information on how to break Supercell Terms of Service.
---
hes blind
---
After decompiling
---
Totally normal and not unfair if you play well
---
‘For fun’ 😂 flexing on those with less talent 👏
---
Emeralds are in the ground. Rocks are also in the ground. Do you know what Robotnik wants? He wants the chaos emeralds. You know what Carl likes? He likes Rocks. Therefore Dr Robotnik created Carl in order to collect the chaos emeralds.
---
HHXHSDJSJ THIS MADE ME CRY
---
My goodneess, what an idea. Why didn't I think of that
---
I meant no offense, sorry
---
How did you do that?
---
u/rtil
---
nah i just don't like childish people making allegations that are completely false. 😂
---
Am I lucky if I got Carl first day, Spike and Pam in the same day, and Frank and Rosa in the same day the first day she came out?
---
*happiness noises*
---
He carried you so hard that even when you lost he got star player.
---
OH YEAH!!!!
---
Makes sense
---
Thanks for the tip
---
Yea!!! You can go on youtube and search how to play siege and learn to control the middle.
---
I mean seeing how illustrator auto traces things for you and all, you dont need to do much
---
I love the way you drew leon!
---
Solo showdown grind?
---
Sarcasm
---
Such a great number
---
 20 x 4
---
I love it so much 😭😭😭
---
and so can the enemy team.
---
doog yllaer si siht ahahaH
---
¿me pueden dar una legendaria porfavor?
---
it's true, i was the blood, the shelly supered and they went sleepy night night
---
Why I’m a laughing so hard at this?
---
Kid, stop posting these shitty things, they aren't related to the game
---
Top 10 anime battles
---
This would make a cool brawler
---
That’s like four months
---
oh, i thought you were the number one player
---
D
---
I’m 864 with my mortis and I’m right outside your house *on the daily*
---
Poco Gang
---
bruh
---
This is the reason Leon needs to Snap his fingers, to erase this monstrosity
---
0.1008% as of this writing.
---
Almost laughed my insides out jk
---
Ciao, ho notato che hai scritto stecca lassù, quindi suppongo tu sia italiano...
---
They’re not the best, they’re just good because they know what to use. ^also ^mm ^abuse
---
I did it as Poco against five teamers. They just lost it trying to hit me.
---
A lot of one-tile gaps, why does everybody forget this?
---
Lmfao 😂😂
---
It’s not crows mechanic, the two are different. The cursing doesn’t do damage, it makes it so that the cursed brawlers will take more damage.
---
Star power is so op it’s like Rosa shield would reduce 100% of enemy team damage
---

---
:O
---
Download Brawl Stats
---
I can see this in BS
---
I hate myself so much today, I can’t read anymore apparantely.
---
It’s ok man, I mess up a lot too ☺️
---
If you think about it since you need to not move you’re easily targeted, so it’d probably only work for quicker recovers behind a wall, I mean, any high damage brawler would still deal with it despite of the heal right?
---
This UI was replaced with the current one one week before global
---
Pretty sure this UI was May or June 2018 - one week before global
---
Yeah, I don’t get the joke the majority of the time, or I take it too seriously causing people to downvote me :p
---
No he doesn’t
---
Stuff like that is to sophisticated
---
Where can you make this type of meme?
---
Reminds me of rouge the bat smh
---
I won’t because they are (Gene isn’t in Showdown), you just got Lucky, more Luck than skill imo.
---
I know something with his brown lollipop ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Because everybody thought he was weak, now we think he is annoying, poor Crow.
---
Lol why the fuck do you say kid so much? So fucking childish. Let people post what they want
---
Can you make a video on YT on how to do this and link me to it? Thanks!
---
It's clearly two rosas fighting
---
SC did an oopsie, just like the gap in ‘Eye of the Storm’. They’ll probably fix it soon.
---
You know that if you post this here you migbt get banned? That's why r/brawlstarsmodding exists.
---
Was watching this  vid yesterday lol
---
when he dies he just gets torn to small lego pieces
---
 Lmao this is basically the concept of mutually assured destruction. No one wants to shoot first cause they know they’ll die second.
---
**shelly is baad**
---
I mean it's not RNG anymore. Every map has or doesn't have its modifier.
---
Stop it, get some help
---
Wait that's illegal
---
It isn’t but it annoys me that every single person posted this even though everybody already knew it because it was posted 5 times before.
---
Seriously, don't, just don't
---
Why is this particular post always reposted? Like I have seen over 10 people repost this... please stop
---
Am I the only one who went to watch this video after this
---
Gene: molesting
---
You should put Rosa in Mass Murder
---
Tbh, if that is how she looks... I don't mind.
---
Even healing mushroom cant save you here...
---
you got 1st place
---
Excuse me, I pushed him to 800 on solo showdown alone, he can even kill shelly if he has his star power
---
More... MORE GENDER BENDING!!!
---
I wIlL gIvE yOu AlL oF mY mOnEy
---
Ohhhh boy... Here we go down a rabbit hole
---
Tbh, I cannot blame you.
---
There r 2 tnt boxes in middle
---
Wait this is really good idea... but now you have to decide whether to defend or attack
---
How do the healing Mushrooms work, they spawn on you only?
---
The title is supposed to be “Brawlers when they’re not brawling” or something like that. Bot says it not in English.
---
‘Twas curiosity that killed the cat.
---
ooooooh shit
---
Very original and funny joke
---
I have a neat tip for you: you probably get 20 upvotes because you complain in the title, next time just say "fan art!" or "I love sakura spike" or something modest
---
That Mortis is super duper stupid!
---
That and also people who team in showdown
---
Oh god oh fu-
