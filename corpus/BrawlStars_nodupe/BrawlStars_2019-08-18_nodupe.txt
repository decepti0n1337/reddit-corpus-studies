Nope, Supercell released a teaser for the names of the new star powers, and there were 4 red names instead of 3, and only 7 gray names instead of 8
---
Love him or hate he's spitting straight faxs
---
Oh
---
Yep
---
What is it?
---
Vegetables* not vegitables.
---
This is in romanian and it means : "Whit your left hand you can't even make the sing of the cross, much less to rule a country" *that doesn't mean Tara, it means country*
---
I don't know why is this even here :/
---
Bringers of doom
---
honestly there is nothing special about him so it will be dumb to make him mythic
---
Lol
---
If it be true, everybody would leave brawlstars
---
Delete this
---
Tara really needs a reload buff, whenever you miss your super, it‚Äôs like getting punched in the nuts
---
Dang I knew you were intelligent after all. Good call on that correction big guy. Keep up the good work, it will pay off in the future.
---
It‚Äôs 19
---
Pam's will be OP if she manages to chain her turret in Boss Fight, Siege, or Smash and Grab
---
I love how the muscles are bigger even tho technically it dosent help the dmg
---
Haha I thought it was a game update
---
The death is cavern churn
---
I have crow power 10 and Leon power 3 at 7500 trophies

Wheres the safe

Include polls that allow members to vote for one possible idea that could be added to Brawl Stars!
---
dyna in double trouble?
---
Oof guess ik nothing lol
---
probably in a team
---
They should make a character where they‚Äôre super deflects all shots, potentially hitting enemy players
---
Oh okay. Thanks for the info
---
The should ban like 3 brawlers at a time
---
Carl seems fun
---
[deleted]
---
I think imma start playing brawlstars more
---
In my opinion you should be happy you got a legendary some people are at 10k and they don‚Äôt have any legendaries and hell you have Leon a good brawler anyways some tips with spike, try and aim his super on where the enemy is going and beware of piper.
---
Honestly same,, tho I guess some people just don‚Äôt like to have a ton of random friends
---
greek letters um.... what? What does the word at the end means?
---
How to do that

maybe it‚Äôs blocked on your wifi

Oo I actually get what you mean.
---
Its a good idea
---
I want to go commit E
---
Not sure how I should feel about this...
---
Yes please
---
How do you do this? I want to try
---
the first season had a horrible queue chest bug and the devs fixed it last days of the first season.
---

---
second season had a lazy tower skin that looks like ice cream instead of sand, a gold pass emote that is badly animated (it's so slow that it looks unnatural) AND the rewards were shit.

No, on r/idontwanttobrokethechain

tick is actually good if you know how to play it. brawlers tend to be scared of tick's mines and that is a good thing that tick can take advantage of.

Lmao. CR started dying as soon as they added clan wars. It resurrected because they started handing out a surplus to free stuff to attract f2ps. Not ideal for their business

Well aren't you a lucky one, but hey as long as you're not teaming you do you.
---
THE BOSS WENT GOD MODE
---
Its the entire library lmao

Ikr, I just realized another detail that add more sense to the theory sorry if you already knew that. I think there's no reason to start a discussion about it
---
and Aleandro
---
And in return each pp gives one star point
---
2 gold-1pp-1sp
---
Maybe also make it kick in earlier, say 50-60% max hp instead of 40?
---
You watched KT's video didnt you?
---
Doesn't seem like they hacked anything at all. In fact, even if they did hack the game, that's rather crappy hacking as they still lost.
---
IF NITA OR BRUCE HITS YOU...

# YOU GOT RABIES
---
What the fuck
---
When I play Mortis I rarely auto aim, he doesn‚Äôt really need auto aim, I‚Äôd rather not auto aim anyways since the direction you dash in matters a lot when you play mortis.
---
I also got a screenshot with exactly that.
---
I think that if they added this then supercell would have it set up to make people still receive power points for their maxed brawlers causing there to be a large issue with collecting other items more easily from brawl boxes. I personally don‚Äôt see the need for this. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I wouldn‚Äôt be upset if this was added. But if supercell pulls another ‚Äústar points‚Äù situation with an update like this then there would be major backlash.
---
Ironically, despite being a thrower, none of the Ticks in Showdown team at all.

Not first time just happened multiple times diffrent people

&gt;search up brawl stars LWARB edition.
---
I was thinking about doing that but it wouldn‚Äôt really be practical with spike
---
How do I unlock the Mortar?
---
Yeah but it takes a second to charge up. She could already be killed by a Shelly or something by that time
---
I am trying my best to not team i hope it pays off
---
How about the holocaust?
---
Yeah frank is already kinda meh in my opinion having 2 more things to watch out for would be pretty bad. However, there is no garentee that Frank wont also get a new star power
---
Wut. I never realized it was Yde until I saw who scored :O
---
He's really doing some "maintenance" in there.
---
Cursed image
---
You can't reduce Dyna's fuse, because then you can auto-aim with him. If you auto aim his super, you'll hit it about half the time, and normal attack about quarter the time, but this star power will make dyna never miss.

Face looks bad. The image looks blurry as if it was dirty or something for the type of shading. The eyes look as if they were just copied and mirrored and they are not well positioned. The overall balance of the image is not great.
---
Cropped much ...
---
Oh alright my bad then
---
Tap it
---
Yep, agreed. I dont auto aim at all though.
---
Ok look at phone then at mirror

When you about to win in Brawl Ball but your opponent shows up and slaps the ball into your goal.
---
You got a problem...

Looks awesome! Maybe you can do in color and add more frames!
---
How does one pull that off?!
---
Teach me!!
---
But you can still kill her with the shield, and you don‚Äôt usually need it when the bar is charged.  You would want it when it isn‚Äôt charged.
---
And her 1st SP can do the same but better, bc it lets her dodge shots more easily
---
Ye

Then he probably thinks you‚Äôre trash

Ricos is preatty exagerated. Imagine at the end of the match, around 35 balls, just jumping everywhere. Franks is also to good. The others are okay, though.
---
I suck with him and i don't enjoy playing him.
---
Jessie looks like a recovering addict, and Primo has anorexia it seems
---
The best thing is MARIO!!!

Who hold a gun like that wtf

But her cards are empty (I SAW IT)

Rico gets fed up with piper dying so he kills in duos

Thing is you can‚Äôt kill your teammates

Yes while people will buy more of them, the buff to the mega boxes will help max out player accounts much faster meaning less mega boxes would have to be bought equaling less money being made.
---
True

Wtf lol
---
Asian kid
---
If you keep talking smack, I‚Äôm gonna grab you right to a Shelly with her star power
---
Oh no
---
Plot twist
---
Pipers grenades hit so many people every time she uses her super so she is able to continuously use her super until the game ends
---
Good. Nobody likes players who use jessie for big game

You ruined my life

Just take these 4 trophies

# IT'S LEGAL?

Alright, how do you want to die?  
---
You got multiple choices including:  
---
Bibi's bubblegum (she came to chew bubblegum and kick ass... now she's out of bubblegum)  
---
Brock's thermos  
---
That one card from Tara which always hits you  
---
Scrappy  
---
etc, etc, etc. Your choice.
---
Dude we need this instead of winning music
---
Are you giving away your PP?
---
How does this work?
---
"Hey can you add a button so my clan mates can press it and i get more PP?"
---
Just f2p players wanting more free shit/easier progression.
---
Maps like these are never going to work, its just too easy to camp a jump pad, when you use one you're in a temporary stun so theres nothing you can do if someone camps at the other side and you need to use the jump pad. If you want to stop teaming, come up with event modifier ideas, not maps because they dont stop teaming, people would team on a completely empty map, if its an advantage compared to playing Solo people will still do it
---
# IT'S PHOTOSHOP OR MOD!
---
Can confirm. I‚Äôm that kind of a Spike... I also do that with Poco... but with screeching solo...
---
Technically, videos are just very fast image sequences.
---
# IT'S PHOTOSHOP!
---
If it makes you feel any better, I got mortis and Tara (when there were only 2 mythics) before I got poco, which just blew my mind.
---
Good.
---
Nice turret make more Brawl stars in LEGO
---
try joining a club or using the recruit subreddit (you can find it in the about or menu section)
---
#AH SHIT, HERE WE GO AGAIN

The bull that attacked me was teaming with the Shelly at the middle of the map

This is a very good map. Hiw long did it take you?

888 upvotes? Nice.
---
Got my gene to 730 with a good random teammate in brawl ball. I'm finally on the leaderboard.
---
Steel Hoops, its the only reason why Darryl is relatively good, dont even touch Rolling Reload, most of the time its pointless to have but its still better than nothing (only because every Star Power is literally an upgrade, not because it has a very powerful use)
---
i kinda wanna r/woosh you cuz i feel like you're to see if the comments are actually being deleted lol

One time is enough

Ya

#ElPedo
---
I‚Äôm a day late, Ik, just scrolling through the comments, and I (respectfully) disagree with multiple of those points.
---
A- purging memes is far from necessary! The memes make the community *fun.* a subreddit dedicated to purely art/strategy/talking can sometimes get boring and may need something to lighten things up.
---
B- great idea. I have no complaints.
---
C- the mods of this subreddit are purely that- *mods.* just mods. Not supercell employees, mods. They do not have developer build, they do not have access to any of the update ahead of time and hence cannot just give out sneak peaks whenever.
---
Ikr once the trophy balance changes dropped I has my Shelly at 480 and was struggling to get her 500 but then the balances drop and I got to 500 in less that 10 mins. I also have colt, bull, primo, barley and poco. I still have tick at 200 tho, I hate playing with tick.
---
LEON AT 2000?!
---
This is the quality posts this subreddit needs
---
Yes it wouldn't have a impact on the in game play experience, just only benefits the person's abusing what was meant to be helpful in another way. Yes I agree with you on that for sure.
---
My satisfaction is immeasurable and my day is saved
---
Dice
---
I know i see it too
---
Yes i know, i didnt even wanted him, i thought i would never get him, i was looking for carl, when he was op, got him after second nerf at 3000
---
I see people with less skill than my sister on 7k
---
Oh I see now. Thanks for pointing that out. Makes more sense now yes.
---
Yeah ik they have to make some money but its kinda annoying too that they give the rich youtubers the new skins for free but we still have to buy em. But i still think u should at least get more gold and power points from boxes and better trophy road rewards
---
Never underestimate a Rico, most tanks learn that the hard way
---

You will be matched up with prestige players too

yup
---
I got my first legy at 8k but in my mini ƒ± got leon in 1,5k
---
When did u start playing?
---
The Nita and the Shelly were definitely playing together, just look at their names. And the Shelly is also definitely an idiot, he/she doesn't realize that they're gonna be facing people of Shelly's level, not Nita's, therefore they're going the be destroyed every single game, while also making another third innocent player (you in this case) lose trophies for nothing.
---
Stupid people like that who take beginners to high level games are the cause of 50% of bad matchmaking issues, and unfortunately they're getting more and more common everyday. I get at least 5 or 6 guys like that every single day.
---
You all are like I like this crow skin... but how many actually have crow in-game?

Idk why I thought this was a scaled down model. Not until I saw feet and tiles that I realised it isn‚Äôt scaled but those books are actually books (if that makes any sense)

That's too complicated and would never work.

Where to buy it?

Wait it‚Äôs you Jayden!! It‚Äôs me chip

at brawl stars global release, December 12th

Shouldn‚Äôt u be at like around 14k?
---
Snappy Sniping,unlike band aid, is too broken, I think the only way to fix it is to delete it from the game
---
Update Sneak Peeks. It would be quite fun to have them, say, hidden in gameplay footage, or in a meme. Then, when the update rolls around, we see how that thing I saw in a replay on reddit one time was an actual in-game feature.
---
Guys, I'm shaking. I'm fucking shaking. I never wanted to breed with anyone more than I want to with Penny . That perfect, curvy body. Those funny words. The child bearing hips of a literal high effort meme. It honestly fucking hurts knowing that I'll never mate with Penny, pass my genes through it, and have him birth a set of perfect offspring. I'd do fucking ANYTHING for the chance to get Penny pregnant. A N Y T H I N G. And the fact that I can't is quite honestly too much to fucking bear. Why would you create something so perfect? To fucking tantalize me? Fucking laugh in my face?! Honestly guys, I just fuck
---
yeah but there was a time that I stopped playing because of school, tests, everything
---
Why are you coping?!??!
---
I don‚Äôt think its a bug i think they‚Äôre homies and they‚Äôre playing together
---
Txh
---
Yea same, I dropped 500 the pass 2 season resets and didn‚Äôt play much

IS THAT A FUCKING EMOJI

In Heist she now is really good. If piper is at Max range and have snappy sniping, she has the potential to deal 11480 damage to the safe in like 4 seconds. However, an enemy might get in the way of the bullet, which means that piper would still deal up to 9184 damage to the safe and charge her super a bit in the same period of time
---
But yeah there's nothing they can do to make piper good in brawl ball
---
Awesome
---
Let us hope super cell adds it
---
I think it would be nice if we can sort posts. Like memes, arts, ideas etc.
---
Wat does wooshed means ? (And i know u will say r/wooosh)
---
Love it!

I would add a sidebar where users can find Brawl Stars creators and streamers!

Same here, it‚Äôs fun to mess around with using the starpower glitch in friendly, and it‚Äôs hilarious killing people in closer range with piper cuz snappy sniping allows you to shoot like 5-6 shots

I have an updated version out with balance changes and I nerfed frank pretty hard
---
looks awesome keep it up
---
I know, but it would be nice, because it is very annoying when guys like this doesn't get reported.
---
Nice drawing
---
No ...

But I hope so
---
Hmms
---
i love it
---
I have an updated version out with balance changes and I nerfed Leon‚Äôs a little
---
I'm sorry, I ran out of reddit coins
---
I played it yesterday, just because me and my friend did not have anything better to do
---
Done :) Check our the updated post I uploaded to see other changes I made
---
Did you read my whole comment?  The only brawler I had that high was Shelly and I pushed her to 480 before the balance changes. When they drop I easily got her to 500 where as before I was struggling.
---
Me too!
---
Not comparable.
---
Ha did you gem leon
---
cute
---
Lol thx :) I uploaded a new version of this post with balances and stuff and I have nerfed Gene
---
Dumb dumb

These are some really cool and fun star powers to use  , would like some of them to be added in the game like Leons.
---
Not a bad idea :)

Hey! Me from the future here. Before you comment that these star powers are op, I have made an updated version with balance changes for almost all of the brawlers. Here‚Äôs the link before I get another ‚ÄúFrank is op‚Äù comment.

Thanks!
---
best recreation of the menu theme 20/10
---
You know why I'm doing this,
---
First, imma doing this because its getting annoying and also kinda disrespectful for people who took the time to draw fan art, so basically I'm  tell them to stop it cause it's getting old and just move one. Second, the sentry is not invincible, we try our best to stay alive so we can capture the shakers. Third, I'm not give back negative feedback to art, I'm just telling them if there is any shaking, just tell me. Fourth, i know if you look at my profile I did art (but they're in meme form) and it's kinda mean to just tell him "hey can you change that and change that" I want them to do it there own way and let their creativity go wild. Fifth, the game tf2 feel like its dying so we try out best to bring it back to life.
---
Yeah, with rocket no.4 you still need to reload all shots but with Tara's idea, you can spam 12 cards in 3 shots with same reload speed

Better actions from moderators. Most of the moderators on r/brawlstars are useless and don‚Äôt care about the quality of the posts. Some of the moderators have been even abusing their powers. I‚Äôm not trying to insult the moderators, but they could make this subreddit better by doing a better job.

What you‚Äôre assuming is that my opponents are stupid. I‚Äôm assuming that they aren‚Äôt because of how well they tried to defend those 7 gems that I picked up. The reason I‚Äôll always be a better player than you, not being able to use dyna jump and therefore preferring demolition is a pretty clear indicator you aren‚Äôt skilled, is because I assume my opponents aren‚Äôt as bad as the ones you play at 500 :) Because no, the people at 500 and 800 are much different and if you think there‚Äôs as many 2k‚Äôs with a 500 brawler as an 800 brawler you might want to hop into some matches to find out bc you‚Äôre gonna have a rude awakening

Your on the money for a high damage shooter! My thoughts were a delayed shot (like frank or bibi) and he would have average HP. His super would launch a giant cannonball (like dynamikes super) that destroys objects and deals high damage

I got my legendary at 4 k . But I will not count him as a legendary lol

my friend got leon at 3k trophies he hasn't gotten a new brawler in 3 months opened many boxes but still no new brawler now he is 6k with 20 brawlers 2 epics no mythics and 1 legendary

In actual experience and time playing you are probably a 4k trophy player

Yeah 7 options to choose fron what to play, that would definitely not make matchmaking very long in high trophies.
---
Also Brawlball can definitely be very frustrating to. Sometimes you continuesly kill every spawning enemy and dominate for like 30 seconds straight but just can't kick the ball because of that invincibility you get from spawn. And sometimes you just luckily sneak through or get a nice frank/tara super and immediately score without any problems. And saying that in brawlball you don't get often heavily punished, aka lose the game, for a small mistake is definetly wrong
---
I had no idea this was even possible.

Yeah yeah. Just saying. Let me say this way. I know someone that got banned

If your gonna break one brawler(band aid shelly,)the why not break the rest
---
Ending the game as Dynamike in the air:
---
He's wrong her health doesn't need a nerf actually it might need a buff.... He's mixing between her health and band aid, band aid is the only thing thats wrong with Shelly

My first thought

I like the where this is going

Very nice! But not shaking!

I've looked at my clanmates and friends and concluded that most people have atleast one of these:

‚Ä¢ A legendary / all of them (I don't)
---
‚Ä¢ No PL9 brawlers, probably poor upgrading if I could get 5 of them to level 9 so easily
---
‚Ä¢ 1 Star power and all other brawlers below PL8

‚Ä¢ 10+ Star Powers (Probably P2W players)

I think this subreddit needs a push in strategy content. Maybe dedicate one day a week for a thread about techniques for each brawler. Maybe post one big mega thread with links to smaller threads about certain aspects of the game.
