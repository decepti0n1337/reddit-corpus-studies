I could imagine school girl Bibi being a skin
---
---
---
A bit or little
---
Never
---
Not until Supercell FIXES THEIR FUCKING GAME
---
You should put tnt cannons in his hands
---
Her home run is soo satisfying when used right, and this is probably the best use for it.
---

---
For anyone wondering the way to effectively do this, hide behind the box and pressure with your piercing ability. If they're for example a rosa and can pierce as well, only try this if they dont seem to want to not deal with you. If they do get too close, make sure to push them away. This is why its quite important to always have home run handy. If they're a bull, simply hiding behind, and getting the last hit off is all you need to do. If you dont know the timing then hitting early, and pushing them away to get another hit on the box is fine too.
---
You're partnered with two people at 500 trophies. Matchmaking is fine. Your partners are not. If you don't want to fight 500+ enemies, don't partner with two people over 450. 
---
If I play a 50 trophy brawler and partner with my friend at 350 trophies, I will play 350+ enemies. It's not broken at all.
---
The name checks out :) Michael SteveosaurusRex
---
The justification is very simple:
---
1-New player joins the Game
---
2-Sees this **GOD TIER** offer
---
3-It's a new player so don't have gems
---
4-Buys gems
---
5-Supercell earns money
---
I mean they make fun games. Brawlstars is honestly one of my favorite games but let's not pretend it isn't pay to win as shit.
---
What the fuck is bule
---
Your chance to get a brawler is fucked now
---
Would you mind if I redrew this digitally and posted it? (giving you credit of course)
---
Yes but priorities
---
I actually cannot believe how ducking ignorant they are
---
I GOT BO A DAY BEFORE THE UPDATE AND WAS SO EXCITED TOVGET A FREE BOX BUT NOOOOOO
---
U GET NOTHING BECAUSE I CANT GET ABOVE 300 trophies bedsore going on a losing streak back to around 80
---
please no, i already spent money to get shiba nita
---
You should post this on r/bogang
---
Was that supposed to be funny?
---
Its not too p2w
---
U can progress like a normal person in all 5 of their games
---
Sire u will progress faster if u pay but if a game doesn't have enough p2w aspect, that game will NOT last long
---
In low trophies youre matched up against bots. Imo the profile doesnt matter at all so im not sure why op is complaining. It is still comedic tho haha.
---
Yes I played a match to check if that was the reason but I stil was not able to view the match
---
Only 3.5k ?
---
I agree it should be like 10% lmao
---
can we upvote this to 10k
---
I didnt know you did
---
No - because maybe someone has a lvl 9 Colt But sucks with him. He’ll be playing against lvl 9s who are good. 
---
The only fair way is trophy level.
---
go to brawl stars subreddit itself r/BrawlStars and press on top right corner and then press change user flair

How about 49x value mega box for low players? I'm salty

Narancia sucks at math

I also don't like to color my drawns

Its not good...

Its PERFECT!
---
Low effort posts are against the rules
---
\*sad darryl noises\* everyone forgets
---
What happened??
---
He was tho and he had no choice it was at the end of the game, no space and he was hitting her from a distance until they were too close. He sure was.
---
The enemy team is not 500. They're nearly 600. If you partner with two 350 trophy brawlers as a 50 trophy, then it would be quite unfair to face three 450 trophy brawlers.
---
Who plays that game still? Is this 2011?
---
Holy what is this sorcery
---
It can mean both
---
He looks derpy xD
---
Average 6k trophies?
---
Is that ken Rosenberg from gta vice city?
---
But they know about dating, so they can be like "WOH, THERES A DUDE WHO IS KISSING A DUDE! THAT'S PRETTY LITTLE" r/youngkids for what the kids would say lol
---
Random
---
And now it's not easily attainable, it's basically impossible for anyone who doesn't want to play the game for multiple years consecutively and also stay good enough to be some of the top players in the game.
---
Have you not played a game before? It's going to happen no matter what
---
This is the most accurate representation of supercell post
---
r/superoriginal
---
Not even, they get like 1000 points which is nothing if you want to buy a golden skin
---
This is so low effort. You insult Coach Cory and recycle a meme template and put a couple of words on it and expect it to be funny. 
---
On the title, you put "Stop". 
---
I think you should "Stop" making these low effort memes and put some more time into your post.
---
Are you a meme master?

The firts three are nita shelly and carl and, Oh what a coincidence i have nita with her First SP and shelly level 9

I was driving the other day and somehow the digital speedometer got changed to km/hr. I thought I was doing 50 mph when the speed limit was 25 mph even though it didn't feel like it. Once I figured out what happened, I just estimated until I got home to ~~un~~fix it.
---
My high school also trains pilots, so I've had plenty of experience with .24 hr time. It is indeed the superior time system.
---
The fact that we wait for 14 days only to get 1 star point
---
Tons of bugs like some people can’t even get into the game and stuff the leaderboards are messed up, the games resolution is terrible and other stuff.
---
# ooo I love this fan art!
---
Exactly the same for me sometimes it becomes so laggy it isn't playable.

Comeback when over 10k with no legendaries.
---
Why is this getting downvoted lmao? How does this very mild statement trigger people?
---
You can use this nightmare fuel if you want
---
This. I've spent close to $1k on this game (come at me) and haven't spent a dime since maxing everything. There's no reason to spend money, unless they start making me better somehow. I'd love to pay more of it helped actually aim better lol
---
Well no then it'd be boring but maybe
---
I feel that bibi just had a face swap by the body is a different colour fade then the had
---
I’m soooo glad I didn’t stay up, I was literally thinking about it but now I’m glad I decided to go to bed.
---
Sounds easy enough
---
Yup
---
Is this real or is a SP swap?
---
Contact Supercell immediately, we need School Girl Bibi as a new skin
---
Well idk about BS cuz I havent really had any problems with it, im still fairly low at around 6k trophies so that might be why. 
---
Although I cant seem to max my brawlers no matter how hard I try and coins are tough to get but you dont really need power levels if you play gem grab and bounty. 
---
I am 100% very salty about the whole CR battle pass though, big slap to the face especially since I was gonna break 6k this season as a lv12 f2p player...

Good lol

You know what this sounds like lolm when old people complain about how hard they used to have to do things, and now that it's easier to do they're mad because the younger people don't have to struggle as much
---
Classic case of "well i had to do it, so they have to too!"
---
So if we delete our account can we get this offer? I spent maybe $20 so far and I haven’t even opened half that amount of mega boxes and have zero legendaries lol.
---
You added yellow text to a game screenshot and left typos in an illegible caption 😫 this is the OC we need
---
*checks sub*
---
What have you brought upon this cursed land

Lol I can definitely relate I’m lvl 12 in legendary and I might quit bc of the battle pass bc that just messed the game up for me tbh so I’m with you on that one

*confused global player noise*

Well I guess we know who just got Leon
---
Wait. Is Supercell already on summer vacay? Will they fix this trash after the summer?
---
It does benefit maxed players to some extent, but the prices of some skins (like 50k star points seriously?) is unrealistic to get, even with the introduction of star points. Many people on reddit have done the math with examples of 17k+ players so you can go find those (it is still gonna take a lot of time for them to get eg Gold Mecha Bo). And, the majority of the players are not maxed and may not have brawlers above 500. So basically, apart from ranking up their brawlers, they get 0 star points, and pre update they'd get some brawl boxes, and obviously the brawl boxes are better than nothing (which is what they're getting now). 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
So...
---
Maxed out players are complaining due to too little star points rewarded 
---
Non maxed out players are complaining about the entire star points system (which is, as I said, the majority of the players, which is why this subreddit is filled with those posts)
---
How did you download the app though? I have been trying to download brawl on my chromebook for ages and havent been able to do it.
---
Bring the tokens back. The change is the season reward system is so disappointing.
---
Next do demolition bear when it gets released
---
The carl on the right
---
The look on that spike be like
---
“Oh no I have done it again”
---
Anyone remember this format? Or the Primo format?
---
Multiple times huh?  Like 5 times?  Well I guess that makes me look like a fool.
---
This got more support than expected,ibwas just sharing some casual draw i made bored lol.
---
im making spike,expect it by tomorrow! i will try to improve the shadows and give it a nice 3D impression ;)
---
... and you? Do you have any?
---
You will almost never get super chained if you play primo right
---
OMG UNAFFORDABLE COSMETICS YEAH
---
Smol Tick
---
Tickets
---
That'll be 5000 star points
---
*A R T*
---
They can always set the people that bought it to have -3000 gems in debt, that way, NO SKINS, NO BOX OPENINGS, NOT TICKETS AT A SHORT TIME NOTICE, NO NORE GEMMING, i honestly think they should start with that
---
I didn’t even get mine
---
Idk I just have a talent
---
A lot of people are saying it is but I didn’t get the offer
---
Hot Rod Brock😎, one of my favorite skins
---
Prepare for atleast 2 probably 3 more seasons like this because they are all on vacation for this month and can't do squat
---
I can relate so much to this
---
But yah, getting like 16 points was kind if disappointing.
---
Didn’t spam it
---
Within the next few weeks, I really hope this problem doesn’t get buried under all the repetitive memes. Supercell needs to know that nobody is in favor for these new season rewards.
---
Shocky bear shoots electro ballz
---
They could make it based on damage and kills so it is fairer
---
Yeah, I think 50/day is much better. With season rewards and brawler level ups, I think it's a much better ratio. Thats 1500 star points a month
---
I pretty sure I was to late. F
---
Thing is most people hated double rewards. So to justify normal rewards they had to make it shorter but people now hate short siege.
---
i was asking about brawl stars, sorry
---
490 boxes is definitely not enough to get all the brawlers.  At .2% chance that might get them one legendary.  And it was a bug besides.
---
Probably, because Tick is control, Darryl is damage, and Penny's mortar provides support
---
Oops fprgot, my name is alpha king there
---
I’m going to be doing ROTC, so I should probably get used to it too. I didn’t think about that.
---
I got 13 from colt at 525. Had mike at 480 thenmpushed him back to 501 but i pushed him back to 501 after season ended
---
After this season ended up, i know tokens are better than star points
---
The core of the game is really good, but hyper casual mechanics and loot boxes are annoying at best.

Omg so easy
---
Kawaii
---
I'm at 8.2k and got nothing. Actually not even jealous. 7 points would make my 6900 look bad and feel like a slap in the face.
---
If there was a currency conversion system...

I played in December 14 2018 but my friend who played in January has more trophies than me
---
None, you don’t have enough.

Ok now you’re just flexing
---
I now have 7307 :’)
---
Not even gunna bother saving up :’)
---
The person just gor leon, got power points, and upgraded him to level 10 b4 his first match
---
I'd rather have my 7.4 boxes than 2 star points
---
How could Dalgom get in this subreddit ? @__@

A glitch that only occurs to the scrubs with 0 gems
---
*distant megalovania*
---
Yeah, somehow having to grind for ir for months/years is the definition of free
---
Oof
---
Hey that's cool
---
Yeah, I agree it’s unfair, I would like to get the same deal
---
The whole idea for them costing so much suppose is to reward the absolute best of the best, seeing as how the top players almost never really get anything special for the amount of work they put in
---
Besides,  the originals will be available soon enough for average gem purchase
---
No.
---
Even then, it's cool, because the word 'stellar' makes me think of space.
---
And also how many rank 10 and 15 brawlers, too.
---
*proceed to default dance while flossing at the same time*
---
This is cute lol
---
The 1k part was just a shameless flex
---
Basically my experience in Solo when I play as Barley
---
So you have all brawler expect legends?
---
............sorry but this star power is almost useless...............
---
Don't agree with the crow buff one... We asked for it... A lot... totally not biased because I have crow😅👍
---
That’s because you gotten some from ranking your brawlers up every five ranks (10,25, and at 20)
---
Because it isnt lmao it's the least pay2win out of all supercell games
---
It was a bug.
---
Really, someone said they made a new account to test it but it didn't work.
---
nobody asked. If you were to say "Brawl Stars you still have time to fix everything" the meme wouldn't do that well because it doesnt sound as good. Besides, refering to the brawl stars developer team as supercell is still correct. Don't you got better things to do then critique a meme that isn't supposed to be taken so literally?
---
Got 172 but still what am I supposed to use them for, miss the old 800 tokens every season 😒
---
Come on give somethings better for the non-trainers even if they DONT let you win... They aren't as bad as framers😂
---
What I mean is, in the name of "endgame" they ruined the rewards for new to mediocre f2p players rewards
---
How did you open scw files on prisma 3d???
---
mecha skins also have no new voices, animations, etc. This is just a color change of the original mecha skin.
---
Thanks you :)
---
Sneaky
---
They can do that without 'surprise mechanics'
---
No problem
---
Oh okay
---
I just don’t understand why you wanted to push evenly before but one at a time now.  I don’t get why anything in this update would change that
---
Its better
---
I can guarantee that without a change to the system you will never ever in your life have enough to get the gold skins
---
El primo 2.0
---
You also dont have to complain lol
---
God it baffles me when people are so unintentionally ironic
---
Why *don't* you want your brawler to be LGBT, literally nothing will happen to him
---
Repeater
---
Is there any game like BS? Going to delete it rite now :D
---
Sounds like those are your mains?
---
In order to get more star  points consistentlyin case they do something other than cosmetics. Now it’s a harder decision to have fun or gather star points in case.
---
Only got 422
---
Jessie's turret is called scrappy and the gif dog look's like scrappy
---
I would give 10 upvotes if I could. This is so relatable
---
Actually no, the only thing this could probably help with is low damage brawlers..
---
Thanx for the 9999999999999th uploAd
---
This is good I upvoted but maybe you should divide it by two or four because it IS endgame content
---
Oh my god, i’m missing the exact same brawlers 😂
---
You think supercell wants new players to instantly have every brawler for 49 gems? Skip the entire game with a couple bucks? Use your head dude.
---
No need to cover their names ;)
---
This is a progression based game. I don’t feel like explaining this stuff.
---
Except that all healing is reduced by 80% in Big Boss
---
He looks like a kirby character
---
Do it plz ! Very good idea
---
Pacience Mortis and Tara are the key 😁
---

I forget 😅 What a f*cking awesome play holy sh*t
---
Send me the kink plzz bro
---
Oof,this is a bruh moment and you roasted me and now I want to die.
---
Yes
---
Meh, If I could buy it is obviously I will buy it but, I get one box for 49 so..
---
Exactly this. Shelly will still suck as a big.
---
Ads in a game feels really cheap. Especially for a company like Supercell who aims for the highest quality in their games.
---
Not to mention ads can actually hurt the player base. I've seen other games just replace ads with free daily rewards because people would switch to another game they see advertised.
---
_FBI O0EN UP! _ ^o^
---
Win with Mortis at Heist, Piper at brawl ball, Tara at heist 😂😎
---
Repost
---
Just awesome. Can you make ending too loo
---
Nope, that's not how it works
---
I created my first account on global release 
---
And my second account a month ago and I don't have star shelly on my 2nd account
---
I would make it 50% instead of 40%
---
dude your perspective is refreshing
---
What about the tokens AND this?
---
I like the new siege
---
Wait is this big real with the 49 Mega boxes?!
---
I know but i like it so i posted
---
WTF? Star not STELLAR ARAB
---
Yeah thats what i faught of
---
If they don't roll the offer to everyone, supercell have lost a costumer. No single cent will be spend ANYMORE. This is the most UNFAIR GAME supercell has, and they just say NOTHING. It's so shady that only new players get the offer... players who has to buy gems to get the offer... a bit "weird". We are not dumb, supercell.
---
https://pixelcrux.com/Brawl_Stars/Map_Designer/App?uid=Srj7JpI31CTxok2RLNMDuYWUUIx1&amp;mapId=-LhMkWYohnYs3WoJVjEG
---
Yeah thats what i thought of
---
Well the the no.1 player in the world only got 3500 points
---
Actually, about 3-5% of the community that left during landscape hasn’t come back. Ever heard of a guy named Kai? He used to be one of the best players in the game; his Mortis was legendary. If you haven’t heard of him, it’s because he quit after landscape.
---
My account is no where near maxed out
---
Yeah it's easier to rank up
---
I gotta say that showdown map indeed looks really cool, I understand why people would vote on that one.
---
it would have been better if i actually calculated it correctly... it takes 15 seasons to get all the star skins if you get all your brawlers to 100 trophies every season, not 31 months.
---
That’s not how things work here..
---
&gt;Whatever they do, they would get more hate  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;No they would not get more hate from me if they game me the chance to buy that same offer, even x3 price. If they don't do anything for the rest of us poor fools they can forget about my money.
---
Yeah, I voted on it. Cant wait to play it!!
---
/hug
---
lol
---
Crow is about to commit a hate crime
---
The mortis has done it again
---
Shes r i p p e d, she has every single brawler's star power at once, even the ones that wouldnt work
---
She won't get one anytime soon. That's what Supercell said.
---

Hopefully

Bcs As I said she is perfect the way she is now

I knew it was a joke, ok?
---
Totally agree and you get a cookie too because you like Poco
---
A am at 10k and i literaly don't have any brawler above 500. 
---
10k and nothing as end season reward.
---
yes it is
---
Fucking love it
---
Good idea but I still prefer the normal tokens.
---
The same pass they added on clash of clans and clash royale
---
Potatoes as far as the eye can see
---
I didn't get it
---
That is really good
---
But the Guy on the Picture is not a good Schauspieler

really ! are you kidding that game is trash

But it was duos??

Lol

Itsl ike sonic vs metal sonic but brawl staes

What are you calling potatoes. My teamates eyes, brain, both?!
---
That last moment tho
---
hope you are having a wonderful day, i like your comment made me smile : )
---
Bring back old siege. +10 per win and -8 per loss
---
lol Im ranking up tick and I dont get starpower...

The "make Frank even less viable" starterpack lol.

I personally don’t think piper needs a remodel because she looks fine

STRAIGHT shot
---
Ohh 😂
---
I did not say that i like the idea. I just said one possible reason to this offer
---
I'm not gonna spend 2k gold for a star power, that's a terrible deal.
---
Thank you wgvn, Very cool

---
LOOOOL a bug please don't be stupid.It is completely intentional this won't make you skip half of the game but have just have a head start and make you addicted  to the game once you get one fancy legendary and spend money  but the way in making its useful is really long.Even if this is you second account this will be just one level 1 legendary.Why do you think nobody of the progressed accounts received it.Why is everyone so stupid can't see that reality that is 1cm before theirs noses.
---
THATS THE BEST PIXEL ART I'VE EVER SEEN!

Lol they always catered to the majority of the playerbase. It is time they cared about the tops

Oh then... thank you 😁

You literally just copy &amp; pasted what was said in the patch notes on the Reddit post they made a few days ago....

Oh my god that would have been so amazing if it switched to jojo music and did the freeze frame

To be continued...

Geez, stop with the hate comments!

BUT she built him when she was young to have a daddy
---
She was an orphan, who became a pirate and built her crew, including Tick.
---
She got hardened by life, so she became a bit arrogant. Nevertheless, Darryl will keep do what he was built for: protect his little captain AT ALL COSTS. Tick will aid him in that.
---
they lost a customer. so what? better losing one customer than thousands of dollars. maybe even hundreds of thousands of potential money to get.

The emotes will be good for player with tons of coins and maxed brawlers.

i hope you die to a team of 9 bulls as a powerless rico

There is no fuckin way in hell you can pretend ignorance at this.

He needs a remodel to have his model updated to the new system, but he really should be the lowest priority as he looks fine and already has skins with updated models.
---
Oops I posted the same post twice. Sorry
---
R u kidding if you have any skill or intellegence at all Leon is so easy to counter. He is sill pretty good in solo showdown but other than that the only people complaining about him are low skill players Leon got killed

Why don't you LOOK at the patch notes before you criticize my 30 minutes of work?
---
Bad bot
---
At least they reduced the troph loss
---
I am the exception to this rule, I made sure my trophy loss since that update was fucking awful. I seemed to have suddenly forgotten how to play and have turned in to a shitty random for other people.
---
Well not really teaming
---
Dude!!!!!!!!!Sick!!!!
---
13 days not month. lol kid whats ur highest trophies??
---
11.9k here with 0 legendaries and 0.2592 chance
---
Do you want to team with Scrappy?
---
Lmao

---
I mean look at that edit!  Amazing 
---
Look at that 5k trophies and bull! So we'll edited!
---
I'm sorry for u. I hope u get someone soon.
---
Then push!
---
Waiting for a HH
---
He does like her a lot!
---
just get above 100 trophies and you'll be alright.
---
But they replaced new player content.
---
I think so
---
What if starshop offered boxes for starpoints?
---
That really doesn't always work
---
Lexـ:penis crow isn't the most opie skin in the game

Sorry auto correct Shiba nita

You deserve a hug right now : )

If you think Mortis for 49 gems is even remotely comparable to 49 Mega Boxes for the same price I'm sorry but you are the dumb one.
---
Yea but it looks more like a plug 😂

Same I live in middle East my parents get disappointed whenever I get a B in highschool and they have no idea what brawl Stars is

How much trophies you consider high?

I'm now at 7k and don't gain a single star token. And I probably won't gain any at 10k.

I want to level up my brawlers equally. I f*cking hate grinding one brawler.

As user majds1 once said:

hi cloudace

What?

But I f*cking hate grinding a single brawler.

In fact most of the players try to push they brawlers somewhat equally.

it is normal.just solo SD

I also didn't get the offer and I do understand why so many people are upset. I just got used to being treated differently than other players ingame because of P2W, bugs and stuff like that so It doesn't really bother me anymore ;)
---
hi.
---
omg pro
---
We need to spam it though, it is really f*cked up.
---
I spent 30$ and got 20 legendaries over 6 months but i dont have any mythic brawlers
---
At least u can buy some power points or upgrade a brawler or buy a starpower 
---
*hmmm didddnt
---
The boombox is just a fuckin shoe box and he fires yeezys
---
Lmfao imagine the old siege if you would win gain 1 trophy lose = -30

Are there any plans to make unlocking characters more frequent?

trophy balance changes
---
I just noticed that in showdown you now lose 1 trophy if ur at 400-499 trophies if u get 6th place. It used to be u get minus 0. Also I feel that a 3 trophy difference between 5th and 4th place is too much.
---
Indeed
---
I like these changes. I don't like to play brawl stars 3 hours in a row to gain trophies.
---
If they do that they'll be digging their own grave my bud, in short I don't know how to word it but its a lose lose situation for them.
---
Same here and then i see guys that literraly have 1000 trophies and they hav 2 mythics and one legandary
---
What about the 49 mega boxes for 49 gems? If you bought it do you keep the rewards?
---
seems like the same thing with Clash Royale, everyone able to push to 5500 +
---
May be a rank 21 at 750 and 22 at 1000
---
Just a small change frim the lame purple badge
---
Trophy reset still iccur similar and you rank down when it happens
---
Give us the fuckin tockens back again
---
&gt;We want old one back!!!
---
People were complaining left and right about old Siege. I haven't seen any complaints about the new one 
---
If anything,  it's way better.  Old Siege didn't suite the style of gameplay BS has; It was long,  could be completely one sided,  and was heavily team reliant to win . New Siege fits a ton better
---
Still I shouldn’t be getting 10 with a 1st place and a rank 15 brawler.
---
I swear pushing to 500 before this was hell. So my Shelly that I tried pushing got tilted and if had just waited a week it wouldn't be at rank 19 with 392 trophies! Thumbs down supercell. I really wanted quit that week and delete the game because of how hard it was to push and how easy it was to lose trophies and half the time it wasn't your fault. 10th place -7. Reason behind that place ment. Got teamed on by three people. 😐. Such an amazing game.
---
What's so bad about it?
---
Of course his bull is over 500.
---
Gottcha, thanks for the response.
---
Did not you ever run towards your grenades?
---
if not, uninstall the game
---
truth
---
Wooooooooow it's real cool
---
Can you evem get a brawler to 1200?
---
I've retired from CoC, CR, BS, and BB, now all that's left is to try out hay day. (Maybe some day I'll play those games again but for now I sit playing PvZ2)
---
idk ask Supercell, 500-599 trophy range gets 10 for first and -6 for tenth
---
Wow i have never seen this kind of meme. Keep the originality going
---
I still don’t know if this happened or not, but here’s my opinion: if that’s true, I would definitely ask all the money I’ve spent in this game back. I mean 49 mega boxes would mean actually all brawlers, all star powers, and so much gold, my god so much gold to buy all the star powers close to be released. Not to be jealous, I also have a bunch of gold kept away from the previous shopping I made, but nothing comparable with this. This is just a way to make some people really lose the temper.
---
I played a couple games before reading this.   All my brawlers are rank 16+, except for Tick, so when I one 8 trophies on a heist game for tick, I was like "WOW!  I didn't know you won that many!" But then I played a rank 16 Gene game and won, and then I was like "WOW!  EIGHT!?" 😂
---
I went to my clan chat like "OMG WHAT!?  WTF!  8!"
---
Because you won
---
Patchy
---
By winning
---
I looked at the wrong trophy range
---
It won't mean anything anymore
---
And now it's way easier to reach 500
---
Hey, could u make a way to secure trophys? Please...😢
---
I wish can be good at math like batrix
---
Wait who is it offensive? Doesn't offensive mean being rude to someone because of their race?
---
Mortis cooking class manual
---
HELLLLLLL NAHHHHHHH
---
No it’s not a bug. They added a new trophy system that’s OP.
---
This’s awesome
---
and you’re a petty asshole who wants to be special by making everyone else rage quit, and that’s a fact!
---
But it’s brawl ball. Was it some recent trophy change? I would usually get a solid 5 trophies for a win in any mode except for siege at this trophy level
---
Two weeks After their vacation ends
---
flair checks out
---
Now u can get
---
1 trophy per kill would work well to stop teaming.
---
Plz put back on the season rewards plz supercell also I have all the brawlers but u can't get legends why!!
---
They’re separate teams I believe
---
xD
---
Oh my gosh these updates have made me delete the game.. why Supercell why.. 🙄
---
Yes it is the new trophy change what came like 15minutes ago
---
Is this a joke or are you being serius
---
SuperCell needs to add more ranks and rewards
---
Star point rewards at ran 25, 30, 35, &amp; 40. If rank 20 is 500 trophies, rank 40 should be 1000 trophies with double the star point rewards
---
How do you get the blue one?
---
She is still great at 2 shotting throwers which are common on heist
---
so ¿Token Rewards is not coming back? just say "no" and i will uninstall BS right now :)
---
This is pretty rough
---
Pls upvote this post for everbody can see
---
I just pushed bull to rank 16 without knowing this and i was so confused. I wonder how easy will it be to push penny in 3v3 especially after I get her star power(s) hopefully  fast cause im f2p and still need to upgrade her to power 9.  :((
---
Is Brawl Stars ever gonna get a trophygate system like Clash Royale has? Doesn't have to be every rank, just at 500 trophies maybe.
---
Who made this template
---
God I get so depressed when I see one of these type of things. Because I’m white and they’re usually so right. God, most of us white people are so pathetic...
---
Nope because now the trophies will only be based on how much you play the game, and not on SKILL anymore! Before I played one hour maximum but I managed to have higher trophies than my friends because they were bad at the game, but now they will have no problem reaching my level of trophies, just by playing more than me. Please Frank, the -4/+5 was okay, but this is awful, you HAVE to change it as quickly as possible!
---
The challenge is getting your brawlers from 800 to 1200 now... Game is getting longer... Who needs a maxed out account anyway?
---
Proportionally if you reached 700 trophies with these new settings you can reach more. The difference to lower players is the SAME. It’s just easier to reach 500 but it’s also easier reach 1000 trophies now. Think before judge and write.
---
Ahh thats hot

Trophy Balance Change
---
The new trophy system for solo showdown is a big anti-teaming addition
---
r/eddit
---
I hate Cipa
---
edit: now i know already, i am so stupid cuz i didnt check the news
---
Maybe now is necesary new ranks after 20
---
I think Supercell intentions where to implement a new trophy system but they released it without announcing it because they want to create a distraction so that people don’t talk about the glitch where you could get 1 mega box for 49 gems but it would actually give you 49 mega boxes.
---
Note aside, a new trophy system will not work unless you fix the matchmaking system. It has to be fixed to make it more balanced and fair something that takes in consideration the gap between power levels of players, it shouldn’t be more than 3! Why if I’m using a brawler with power level of 4 for example, should I face a power level 10 brawler?
---
Same bruh
---
r/itswooooshwithfouros
---
We need to get 1.5 x of our trophies currently because most of us with over 6000 have spent many many hours getting there but now it will only take nearly half the time. Also, getting to 500 trophies took a lot of skill before, but now we only lose half the trophies instead of gain and lose the same amount. Supercell please take this into account because many high level people aren’t happy. Thanks.
---
I like it
---
I didn’t think there were people who didn’t know what FNAF is
---
Lets go!!!!!!
---
I agree with you, but think about the new trophy system. As everyone is saying old 300 is the new 500. It's nowadays quite easy to push a brawler to 500, since the new system gives you 10 trophies or more for a win.
---
Oh thank you
---
about damn time
---
Me
---
You misunderstood my comment never said I wanted star points to be for newer player's
---
A very well played mate
---
It’s sad I’m Czech and he’s like the 5th most subbed younger in Czech Republic (his main channel has like 800k or something)
---
They havent fixed it yet...😒😐
---
I think the standard is just changing. Remember when they changed health -- it was in the hundreds per character &amp; upped to the thousandths. Similar concept? They want brawlers to reach 500s and beyond &amp; people to play once they've reached 500s instead of being stagnant. idk tho I aint no pro ;)
---
You have no idea how many box thieves I have suffered from as tick
---
You get 100 star points for getting brawlers to talk 10 then 15... None of my brawlers are 500 but I've got 600 star points.
---
Do u think i fuking care
---
not a joke for trophy farmers
---
2 fast 4 u, Piper
---
How do you know?
---
it has no meaning to be at 13,500 and receive 0 thing for that if I didn’t push more!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
you should give a fixed amount for those trophies + an amount for pushing above 500.
---
this change is very frustrating and left a bad impact on the game, you should not remove a very benefiting reward then promise fixing it in two months (in the next update)!!!!!
---
As you said adding boxes to buy for Star Points will make it impossible to benefit from both skins and boxes!!!! 
---
just bring bag the token rewards as it was, with an addition to Star points above 500.
---
Justifying this change with “now you can gain trophies easily has a wore impact” Showdown is full of teaming, and in other game modes you are forcing me to play with a team, which is not always available!
---
you are changing the way we used to play the game.
---
Please triple think about this very bad change since you are losing player’s respect and the love of the game.
---
Noice that person don’t even got brock yet but then theres ticks in every game
---
Yeah. Before getting 500 with a gave you a sense of pride and accomplshisment, now i dont know if that same feeling will come with how much easier it is. I only have 4 brawlers @500 and all of them took much time to push.
---
You're welcome :)
---
this is actually a good way to change it, I'm very thrilled about this change and the soon to be improved value to star points, gj supercell, and keep up the good work
---
You have such a good heart :)
---
Amazing as always GEDI-KOR. Hope you can make skins more often! :)
---
Most of the complaints back then seemed to be more focused on the structure of the over all gamemode
---
I personally really liked old siege, but I'd much rather have this one
---
Wow. You, ... i like this  :)

you make sense more than the rest love it

It got changed/updated yesterday😍😅
---
So what you're saying is that I can get heavily punished in a 3v3 match if my teammates aren't doing their part, but in Solo Showdown, where it's just me myself and I, I will never loose trophies for doing poorly? Got it, I will now only play solo showdown.
---
Whats inside?
---
What she will shoot?
---
Yup 😂
---
I hate that people protest about how hard it is to push trophies, and then complain about how they “put so much effort in”. You are forcing supercell to take time off during their vacation because you are so whiny.
---
You didn't created this meme template and it's not Brawl Stars themed
---
Same, except i hit 5000 a few days ago and got spike and gene in the same mega chest
---
This is why god sent fucking saten to the earth
---
I was playing 1 hour ago and I though it was a bug and now that I see this and I feel disappointed because aswell as other skilled players I was pushing brawlers to 500(this take a lot of time),and now is extremely easy.If the problem is that the new coins are difficult to get why don’t you just devaluate the coin and instead of offering a Bo for 50000 coins, for 5000 and lower rewards for new ranks: 10,20 and 50 for example. This could solve the problem in my opinion instead of changing the hole trophie  system.
---

Honestly, Gold Mecha Crow is really good, i wish it had more great animations than normal mecha crow, rather than just a recolor.
---
Can't they do both tho I'd imagine most of the player base isn't maxed out or nearly maxed out so no reason to prioritize the 10 percent over the 90 percent of the player base
---
I like the idea

How is it harder to push to 500??

---
Supercell can have a great hoilday thx
---
Please I'm begging you its so hard to push my crow please😢😢😢😂😂😂
---
people still watch this
---
Yeah... But solo gets frustrating lol. Idk, I feel like people actually want to lose in most 3v3s
---
Yes, it will be easier to push to higher trophy levels now. But is it worth it? Why is it a problem that 500 is hard to reach? There will always be a certain level of trophies that is difficult to get to, regardless of how easy or hard it is to gain trophies. It may be 500 or 900 or even 300 if you change the ratio. Making it easier to get to 500 just means that it means less to get there. If you make it make it easier to make it to the minor leagues and add a league higher than the majors, it just makes the minors third place still. We'll all still be in the same positions as before in relation to each other, the only difference now is that we'll be able to say that we got more trophies in the process. A thousand dollars in 1918 meant a lot more at that time, inflation just means that you have to rise higher now to get to the same place financially. This all seems like a silly bandaid fix to a problem that wasn't even a problem in the first place. Waste of time to get to where we are to only have the rug pulled out from under us. Good job supercell though, you'll get a lot of us to play the game more, that was the real goal all along. Feign regret at the change all you want. This, and all other changes, are to get us to play more and spend more. Congrats on making everyone's accomplishments prior to this update less meaningful. Now I guess I feel like this game is less of an escape for reality and more of a direct metaphor. Glad I can sleep easy tonight knowing I can get more easy trophies tomorrow...
---
I was going to ask the same thing but I was hoping it wasn't Jessie...

(Or am i wrong?)
---
How do you even get this bug
---
I started playing Brawl Stars since it's global release
---
Oh so spending 150 gems on an offer worth thousands of gems is totally acceptable too? Stop. You aren’t entitled to shit. The reason it’s called a glitch is because it affects a small amount of players and they try to PATCH it asap instead of letting more players use it.
---
Same here. Nearly got all brawlers to 500 way back and now finding it hard to keep up with the pushing. I don't see why people are angry with the update. It's much easier to push now!:D We still got quite bragging rights that we pushed our brawlers back when pushing to 500 was real challenging:O
---
Yesss
---
Wrock
---
Yes, I do remember Ricochet.
---
And me!
---
I don't think that that's true.
---
As a fan of robots i give this an updoot,keep the great art work
---
Your not the only one
---
They aren’t going to release skins more expensive than 50k star points ffs.
---
Hopefully you got that by playing **S O L O** showdown 😅
---
And who are you to know?
---
I have not seen one person that is happy with these changes
---
P e r f e c t
---
Imagine trying to use trophy count as an insult
---
More like brawl pass
---
Bo now respects you.
---
It’s definitely a step in the right direction
---
Maybe little less psychopathic
---
I kinda have the same feeling..
---
It isn't a glitch
---
And it's still your problem. Noone is forcing you to log in.
---
Any game company gives no fuck about 1% of their player base as long as the other 99% pays more then you will ever make in your life.
---
I like how it ends with a rocket right at his face
---
it's probably not photoshop but k
---
Don't forget cheermike
---
Lmao 😆
---
Logical sense. Supercell isn't going to giveaway without-consent 200$ worth of content to thousands of players and just leave it there.
---
Matches are too intense for that I think. And in Heist you have to pay attention to the safe :p
---
Uuuh i dont think i ever have ate a mike bird
---
THANK YOU SUPERCELL!!! I am pushing my Mortis like a crazy in Brawl Ball
---
And the reason you want to wait before getting a new brawler is...?
---
I really didnt expect to max my account just get brawlers and experience them for fun, then maybe get more into competitive. It was nice to get a few boxes after that horrible tilt,  something that gave a little more hope and make the player keep on trying to become better at the game. Even tho youd be terrible at the game at least you were getting something worth all that play time. I can probably adapt to that thing in a few months unless they actually fix it.
---
I just really didnt like to find that out, during last brawl talk it sounded like a great concept and i loved it, even if id find myself grinding like crazy all day! It sounded a lot of fun honestly. til i seen how it was implemented...
---
Ahaha , me too
---
If they flipped it so the reward was gems instead of these star points it would fine. Then they could keep it so skins cost gems.
---
Oh ok. I just started a month ago, didn't know about those rewards
---
What you are describing is something that basically happens in any popular game.
---
As you progress through the game, there always will be a point where you will max out on how high you go while remaining a "casual" (or F2P) player. Unless you play as much as the "pros" do, you will never break through that final ceiling that puts you in the same tier.
---
They play more and they spend money...they're pros, so they are spending money to make money.
---
You really only have two choices once you reach a certain level in a game:
---
* Accept that the best you can hope for is being the best of the casuals
---
or,
---
* Get on the path to becoming a pro
---
If you're not interested in becoming a pro, it's really wasted energy to get upset that you lose to them once you reach a certain level.
---
Yes, there was a new patch this morning about trophy changes
---
''Collect them all!'' At the bottom of the box lol
---
shut up
---
You win more trophies now... Dude it's the same. Now 400-499 is equal to 700-799. Now it's even faster because the quantity lost is the only one that increases till there.

But they got rid of tokens, so it affects you too
---
My skill supports me to push over 500 but my time...... Nevermind, I just hate the way it forces me to keep pushing 2000+ trophies every 2 weeks. Sorry for being perfectionist, it'll be okay if there is no reset until 800.
---
We want it back😥😥😥
---
+100 in 12 matches? Thank you
---
Supercell isn’t avoiding anything they’re just on vacation
---
Don't worry there's no 500 carried noobs at 400 almost all noobs where filtered. Shut your mouth of your superiority complex...
---
4? I got 0
---
This is an amazing concept, I would love for this to be in the game!
---
Some people actually liked the new trophy system. It didn't ruin the game. Besides, its not like they removed any skill from the game, they just moved the bar higher for skilled players (in this case 800+ is the new 500). Tick is almost balanced you probably play solo showdown only. He is insane in gem grab and siege. All in all I mainly disagree with you.
---
Im at 7555 trophies and im so close to get these delicious...50 coins, at least at 8000 ill get a mega box.
---
And yeah thats a good idea but i can hardly imagine Supercell making the trophy road better...UNLESS it really happens and id find myself extremelly surprised.
---
It is not that interisting...
---
Thanks
---
Well it looks like even more people will complete trophy road, meaning that they get 150 coins!
---
Dude I feel you teaming is a real pain, but the sad part is that it can be fixed if they implemented a "report" button in the battle log and remove the "400 trophies for replay" bs. One more sad thing is that in the help and support button when you ask for teaming in showdown it says that  "in showdown you need to play with strategies, including teaming".
---
Then tell him to push further
---
I only have one brawler above 300, and it's at 301
---
Hola, me gustaría que en atrapa-gemas hubiese una opción para soltar gemas.
---
My teammates always tell me to use my super more often as tara, but im just trying to find a good time to use it.
---
thats way too low for anyone diamond and under
---
Awesome, already know it will turn out great :p
---
The skill difference is the same, just the number of trophies they have will be different? If a guy who couldn’t push past 400 on the old system can now get 500, players who couldn’t push past 600 before will now be able to. Make sense?
---
It's called inflation. Now you can push them to idk... 700 and be essentially above all those scrubs with win rates under 50%
---
I feel like Duo Showdown isn't worth it at all. Maybe if  two teams more are added it could be a good mode to gain trophies aswell.
---
Well this is Great :)
---
And our 48 free megaboxes?
---
No, please no
---
What is her main and super attack ?
---
This is a valid point although I think you're forgetting that it takes time to push trophies. Pushing from 500 to 700 on every brawler will take a long time and not everyone has that time
---
500 brawlers are easy to push now after the change. Dont think you should flex It lmao
---
Considering you guys all bandwagon behind one thing for a month it wont be hard.
---
Funny cause I am diamond and got 0 star points
---
Top 10 Chilling Photos Taken Moments Before Disaster
---
That would give you 150 points as you only lose half the 🏆 above 500... All depends how expensive Supercell the non cosmetic rewards will make
---
*Laughs in HmmmMmMmmmm*
---
This is perfect timing for the new Clash Royale update!
---
Im not proud of having 10K with 23 brawlers anymore😔
---
So instead of waiting to release star points for when you were ready to fully open the star shop you just released it early and robbed the players of their 2-8 boxes every 2 weeks that the star shop isn't ready and this happens around the time that you start releasing secondary star powers.
---
I got 2 legendaries. I got lucky I was looking for BiBi and I got Gene :/ he’s cool but Bibi :(. Luckily I got Leon And Spike
---
lol true
---
According to supercell, they won't be worthless when the new update comes
---
I changed my watermark recently. Don't accuse me of being an art thief.
---
But you told me to push them both
---
No you’re just retarded lmao,
---
That's me. Ppl say I don't take risks for that
---
I assume you'll be pushing Pam Shelly Rico and Colt too? :-)
---
*cough* rank 15-19 *cough*
---
Ok nice thanks for answering
---
Are they really honest tho? Feels like some players have really bad luck
---
Well, it is yours(I didn't miss the joke, I just wanted to make another one)
---
I saw el Primo and colt never again
---
Skin top 1
---
Gonna slowly start pushing everybody tbh :D
---
You shouldn’t be able to go below 500 when you reach it. That’s will get players above 500 to actually play with those characters
---
Obv as 500 is the new 300 and we all want our brawlers to be at least 300 right :D
---
You know someone's white if their wearing gene shorts and drinking Star Bucks. Lmao
---
ive been searching for it for a good week so i just edited an existing meme that used it
---
Exactly
---
It would’ve been smarter to approach and outjuke the penny and Brock and super one/two of them. You could’ve even forced them towards your spawning area by just flashing your super. There was no guarantee that they would’ve went towards your side like they did. That was plain luck
---
Yeah, after the new update skins are invisible. You know how you used to see 2 other skins chilling in the back? Well thats gone now, so just swipe left or right like you used to do and it will show up.
---
Did it work?
---
Fudge, i forgot the boxes lol
---
Imagine trying to outshine others with your intelligence, but it turns out you aren't able to  differientiate between an insult and a valid point, making you look not-so-smart in front of others.
---
I feel you man.

When u spend hours to get lvl 4 brawler  to 500 ...
---
Am no at 500 so....pizza time continues
---
Actually 700 is the new 300 because that's when a loss and win are the same trophies.

I also got triggered when my brother spind
---
Yeah, my bad.
---
Please use the dark mode, that image burnt my eyes
---
I was spawning there all the day never got first but got second
---
Is anyone else upset with the fact that they'll now be forced to play with people with significantly low skill level??
---
👌
---
True... My bad :-)
---
Wait for crow or spike.
---
His mommy died
---
It’s cuz Crow’s super daggers spawn around him, not right on top of him. If he lands perfectly on a Brawler, it will just spawn around them too
---
You call THIS a doodle? I feel like you could print it on a t-shirt and I would happily buy it!
---
you all think it will be easy above 400 but you must realise losing 2 matches will lose you 10 trophies it's still not that easy when you lose more than you win because of randoms
---
Hehe thanks
---
Were you also inactive for a day?
---
Yep. Changed it. Thanks.
---
When was I trying to outshine people with my intelligence

My friend got Spike at 700 trophies. I got Spike at 1.1k. My brother got Leon at 1k. Another friend got Leon 3k. Rip my friend at 7k with no legendaries ... and his brother got Crow at 2k

I put the boxes in places where they could spawn not all of the ones on the map are gonna be there so you know😉

Yes, WERE. That’s a pity:/

---
2119?  We have an optimist here people.  Watch out!
---
I wanted Darryl’s star power because I just got him to power 9, but now there are other star powers in the pool, so great.
---
How about just two or 3 different match makes like 1)The standard 2)casual (no trophies gained or lost, just brawlstars) 3) Competitive (this would be where the endgame content lies and you gain access to it brawler by brawler, once a brawler hits rank 20, that brawler gets access. And because it’s a diff matchmaker you could still play randoms and not feel like you are gonna be paired with a bunch of numskulls.) and to go along with this, PUT THE TROPHY PROGRESSION BACK TO NORMAL   ...please
---
They’re slowing game progression and making it so there’s something to do when you max your account. I think it was a great idea
---
That happened to me last week
---
Am I the only one that hasn't seen the night Mecha crow offer? I have the fuckin star points but all I get is bo skins and golden Mecha crow
---
Ok
---
Old Ricochet is there!! R.I.P
---
Spike be out there drowning
---
I got 9 trophies from a single 1st place of solo showdown (using my RANK 18 character) 
---
but hey i’m not complaining
---
They don't have to, but SC should make minus gems who bought this ridiculous offer

He was just trying to be helpful...
---

How this Comic Series probably ends: Bull is the Leader of the opponenet Gang, Colt is Going to Fight against His Big Brother, Saves Shelly and everything is fine
---
The End
---
Add more brawler ranks, this update wasn’t needed.
---
this honestly is a great idea! I do admit the art is not "Directly-put-into-the-game" ready, but its something I would really like to see.
---
This meme is as low effort as the effort now required to reach 500 trophies!
---
She’s fine the way she is.
---
What did you spend it on?
---
🅱️duh
---
Yes looks great
---
They are in the game files
---
Bull looks like he’s holding a flare gun
---
If you go to 15 you get 200 star points
---
me too. even though im only at 7.5k, i feel like all the hours i spent on brawl stars were basically pointless
---
You are absolutely right about being able to play your favourite brawlers that were sitting at 500! I have the same profile as you (11,5k, half of my brawlers 20) and I hated this update until you explained the good parts of it! Thanks for that! I’m still not a fan of everything but it’s true that it won’t be stressful to play 500 brawlers anymore
---
Morris?  Uh huh.  There you go making characters up again, johan.
---
Ies ;) ;)
---
How did you did that?

Sorry buddy, Supercell already confirmed that they have no intention to ban teamers. According to them, teaming is a legitimate strategy, risky, but legitimate.
---
*checks my league*
---
Oh yeah good concept
---
Yeah but this would be cool in my opinion.
---

I would say the robo rumble one is hella hard

Just some skins because I thought that was the only thing I could buy with them.

---
Exactly. To be honest, his **skin ideas** are terrible, he sucks at that. However, his **art** is pretty good. That makes him an excellent artist but an awful skin maker, and people don't get why "Supercell doesn't use his ideas"
---
Glitch, penny super plus brock star power
---
No, its not like that, I tested
---
Apperently this Art stealing Son of a b*tch Stile one of Gedikores Skin Ideas
---
Nice try to crop the credit...
---
ne🅱️o bibi
---
It was better to remodel Crow than Tara....
---
Lol, no. His art is amazing, but his **ideas** suck. There is no way this could be a skin in-game, it just doesn't feel like it belongs. And even when the art is so good, this couldn't be added into the game
---
*Risky* everyone teams exept that one guy who dies because he has Dignety. If that goes on like that, it'll end like it did with Overleveld Elite Barbarians in Clash Royal Ladder....
---
&gt; Supercell only listening to endgame players... it's very dissapointing 
---
You really think the endgame players wanted all the n00bs pushing up to 500 so playing with randoms up there is even worse???
---
This happened to me and It sucks, there should be something you can do about it.
---
im like 11 rank with barley
---
No it doesn't. Nobody benefits from being at 500. It's an artificial goal that you made irrelevant by inflating trophies. All this has done is make playing with randoms more frustrating as you're more likely to play with un-equally skilled players unless you grind 24/7.
---
You need to listen to what people are saying, not twist their criticism into something positive.
---

---
It’s just for display. I have my real one on my cart which I use in battle.
---
Lmao thats why you only lost 2 trophies, you are very low indeed
---
Yes give me mortis
---
why do you want this? is this more important than end season rewards? people nowadays. are dumb
---
So, to fill the void let by the lack of tokens, you guys introduced a TROPHY SUPER DEVALORIZATION then we can buy the new stuff at the new shop with the new currency, with no other reward at Trophy Road, or boxes, or probability to open Star Power in a box?
---
C'mon, you guy were my heroes... It's not a progression issue, it's a reward issue... Those trophies and the possibility to buy "future new non-cosmetic itens" won't be the solution by now.
---
What’s a brawler I only have a thing called Shelly/s
---
No worries!! You are getting 2
---
That was phrased so perfectly, well said
---
Lol i don't see how they "killed" brawl stars. If they really did it brawl stars would be dead game now/many people would leave it. Maybe right now star points at the end of season seems pointless but Frank said they will buff prize in the next update.
---
Im pretty sure there was a reason for removing Life Leech but we can't know it.
---
About +10k rewards, i agree but that don't make game dead.
---
I love the skins that could not possibly make a good character with in the game. I don’t for see there being a lifeguard brawler in brawl stars. This would be a very fun skin for the summer.
---
I love how happy the all-seeing-eye is, great artwork!

That’s the joke cring normi
---
If you're having to push up higher trophies once again then you're playing the game how it's designed to be played. The Brawl Stars team are doing a good thing by allowing for those sitting at a consistent 500 brawler trophy range to get back into a nice trophy grind whilst allowing lower trophy players to do better at the game and more fairly so too.
---
Nice dude
---
Honestly great idea, for me I would wait some months since I'm in master so I could finally afford a 10k skin seeing as I have no rank 20 brawler lol.
---
Mine is 1 mbps always only at 3am its 5mbps don’t know how I pushed to 8000 and i am a f2p
---
I don’t have a single brawler at 500 trophies, but I did get 1900 star points for my brawlers having certain ranks. I believe the benchmarks are the same as when the medal changes.
---
Yeah man

True shit... you from Czech Republic btw?
---
But brawl Stars isn't about getting more trophies ! It's about playing good games.
---
i think that after this the casual gameplay will not je as punishing making the game more accessible to people
---
this game is for kids, but that doesn't mean all brawlers should require 3 iq. Spike is one of the hardest brawlers to use, and he can still be used by some 10 year old who uses auto aim. i dont understand what ,,Not everyone has your "supposed" 140+ IQ and can master the game before it existed friend.'' means so i wont talk about it. you cant play bull without camping in the bushes. his design is one of the worst in this game.  and about that rosa's starpower. i dont know what you mean. my point is that bull is a badly made brawler that doesn't require brain and literally cant be used without bushes. not that bushes are bad and should be deleted.

In Clash royale packets have a 1 second window, to go through, so if your connection drops out for like 500ms you don't notice.

So open a friendly room and play some games with members of the club you're in because trophies in the majority of mainstream Supercell games are consistently encouraging you to gain trophies through one way or another. If you're not enjoying the progression of trophies you're missing out on a large part of what this game is composed of.
---
1 - Good luck with that
---
2 - They just made it super easy to get to 400+ so everyone will be getting replays
---
3 - Not sure how that's better than the current system
---
4 - I don't want people to be able to escape my super by running through bushes
---
5 - You can just buy boxes...
---
6 - No opinion on this one. I don't play Mortis enough

This is phenomenal! Love it:)

Hello, Since I updated brawl stars I have a problem with the store and the problem is that I can not see the images and it bothers me when I want to buy something. I hope it can be fixed.

You should half all these values, then it will seem reasonable
---
Look at news
---
It's not a bug
---
Appreciate it
---
Guys, bandwidth does not matter with Brawl Stars. In fact, very very few information have to be given to the game (who's moving, shooting, status of the map and the game and that's it). This only takes (at most) 0.5mbps (didn't measure that though).
---
What matters is that these packets have to be delivered fast and in a reliable way.
---
Sooooo the parameters to look out for are latency (even though any connection with ping &lt;200ms is fine) and packet loss.
---
Bandwidth, both download and upload, does not matter at all.
---
Gotcha... thx man!

I’m also at around 12600
---
Hate that we hafta lose so many trophies
---
I love this change. Haven’t played some of my brawlers in forever.
---
Yes but if you don’t have much time to push that means you’ll constantly be falling back down to low 500s
---
and hopefully the cost wont be 10k
---
&gt;t(one of my friends didn't get it at all)
---
it just appears on the options or do you have to do something?

Servers are pure garbage
---
mortis gang ally from the spike gang here
---
I saved up like 60 boxes to get Bibi. Instead I got Spike and El Fuego, Leon a week later, Bear With Me two weeks later, and Mortis the next day.
---
So I ended up pulling two legendaries, my last mythic, and two more star powers before pulling Bibi, which has yet to happen. Not bad luck at all, but extremely unlikely that someone pulls all that and still not an epic.
---
Not a complaint, just pointing out that RNG can be really weird.
---
Let me tell you, you're the best artist in this subreddit!
---
It’s only possible if you get super juice
---
saw someone literally just ask for crow
---
The problem is Supercell now is greedy, we ask for star tokens not for this
---
No she will heal herself
---
Me too 
---
I saw someone say something like this 
---
"Brawl satrs sucks it doesn't give u any characters! Uninstall until u give me spike"
---
It would be 21 - 30 making Star Rank as you say at 900 trophies, and the 300 extra as the leaderboard showdown... 20-24(purple) 25-29(red) and increase trophy road by a lot, like real lot because if someone say have 27 x 900 it would go all the way to 24.3k trophies, so in all "leagues" there should be a lot more tiers and prizes...
---
I team to:
---
-other teams don’t kill me
---
-survive more time
---
but never:
---
focus the same enemy, that’s shit

I know, so I want them to make the trophy reset be at the new last rank if they implement one.
---
Nah this is not the server’s problem. It's just Frank using his super.
---
I keep thinking I’m looking at colt but then I catch a view of Shelly
---
I honestly think that people are overreacting. The star point system has a far greater reward system than season tokens ever did. What did anyone ever get out of 5 or 6 brawl boxes as compared to free skins, which this community has been asking for? You also have to realize star points are endgame content, not just basic rewards for any clutz who camps to get over 3000 trophies in showdown.
---
This is AWESOME(not just cause it’s sexy..). Good work!!
---
irrelevant response lol
---
Yes i do
---
Good morning thete,
---
it seems like very easy for the new players or someone getting stuck at 3000.5000/7000.9000. the trophie we only get half than what we could get now. which means very easy for people under 500 to get their brawlers graduated. But the for people who already graduated and remains 500 or just higher get sadness. it force people to play more and more game just because of the new system of star points. Also double reduce the time of what we graduated people did to get to 500. That seems not fair for us. Something changed and it will affect something else. I personally disagreed with this trophies changing. 
---
Star points is just skins. Another skins which people put all their efforts to earn.  Why don't you just lower up the cost of star points? Why don't you ask the players first and then change the tophies we could get? Or improve 500 graduated to 700+ graduated. (500 rank20 then 700 rank 40 to reach the second SP maybe) this could also get us star points, which make the game fair for old players as well. Plz give us more of what the reasons  youve change the trophies so proudly. 
---
Thank you so much.
---
An old player.
---
Sorry
---
I’m so amazed right now, right when I saw this meme a commercial for the Popeyes Bigger Box came on.
---
yeah
---
But in showdown it is not that usefull
---
#TICC
---
I have a level 3 brock on 470 trophies before tick update and was planning to push to 500 but they decide to ruin it by making some stupid trophy changes because majority of players are too dumb to hit 500. I hate this game.
---
Unfortunately I didn’t work with Kairos.
---
Because Naruto is the best
---
 I literally could not be more disappointing in the latest trophy "update".

By making 800 trophies the new point at which win/loss breaks even (as opposed to 300 trophies before), **you've guaranteed that matchmaking will be HORRIBLE until a player reaches \~800-900 trophies.** This is because the number of trophies a brawler has does not accurately reflect skill level until a player requires over 50% win-rate to climb in trophies. Matchmaking doesn't actually work until the win/loss for trophy rewards is equal because players can grind their way to high trophies. With the new system, matchmaking will be abysmal until 800 trophies. Before, the threshold was only 300 trophies.
---
What does this mean? The biggest chunk of play for any brawler (1-800 trophies) will be done in a matchmaking system that does not reflect player skill. T**he matchmaking system should seek to find players of equal skill as soon as possible,** ***not*** **until after 800 trophies.**
---
This needs to be fixed ASAP or you can kiss decent matchmaking in this game goodbye.
---
God this sucks. Why do this? It was literally perfect the way it was. 500 represented something. Now we have to grind 800+ to show that we're any good. EVERY season. Way to ruin one of the best phone games in a measly 1 week.

Club wars would be nice to see. Maybe you can give the devs some ideas.
---
BR?
---
The sad thing about this is that you cant even rely on other mortis' not backstabbing you (._  .)
---
The thing is that this skin is to reward the ones playing before global
---
Normal no hat and rockabilly Mortiz

The skin is limited time only and will never be available again. If you played in beta you got the skin, if you didn’t well too bad. It’s for the beta players only.
---
What would happen if you had the ball and used a pad?
---
No, you dont understand. There will be more bad players in 500 now and players who are actually good now has to play with these bad players every season reset. The new change is dumb af.
---
This is pretty much the same

Does anyone think Supercell wouldn't have to make this move if they left in season end rewards?
---
I posted this 36 days ago
---
This looks good. Good work!
---
At other games
---
pls Supercell, add this
---
How about I pushed SIX brawlers to 500?
---
You think?
---
Oh
---
They will definitely take some of the ideas from today involving star points. This sub has been filled with memes and crap forever so they didnt have much to really go off of, but now that we are seeing more posts like this on the main sub, it will actually be seen . I have high Hope's for supercell after their vacation.
---
It’s so easy now you get +8 -6
---
Yeah i would really like you to get rid even more of the ways im progressing in exchange for cool tokens which can only get me some sicko skins if i collect them for 40 years, thanks supercell
