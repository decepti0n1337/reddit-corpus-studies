I respect your opinion but "siege is trash" sounds like a fact
---

---
Maybe "I hate siege" or "Siege is trash in my opinion" or whatnot is a opinion
---
Primo trash, spike is the way to go
---
OMG YEAH
---
I really like all but the hole. Imagine lagging and you walk in
---
Please tell me you didn’t count all of the power cubes...
---
Yeah my Colt is pretty tilted because of that
---

---
Do you have other suggestions for brawlers other than mortis so I can make the outlines then color them later
---
That was amazing
---
When is there gonna be an new update
---
Thank you!
---
Still happening to me almost one game out of 2. Very frustrating.
---
I really don’t like that idea it wouldn’t be brawl stars with those
---
Frank
---
Frank is the next brawler on the list after Pam then goes Darryl then colt then mortis do you have suggestions for other brawlers
---
Iron blocks, thorn bushes and holes would be extremely annoying
---
Fire crow bringing his wing down?
---
What’s that butt scribble thing
---
But still a shield sounds imbalanced because 50% still makes you near immortal for 10 seconds. Great suggestion anyways!
---
/r/woooosh
---
Awesome! Keep up the great work!!
---
Thanks!
---
Heh, I was the 30th upvote
---
All good.
---
More curves I would suggest, to squary in my opinion but still very nice :)
---
Well same could be said about other brawlers it’s how we go about making the game mode
---
Why would someone actually do that team lol. Its terrible
---
ye
---
Real question here WHY tik tok
---
What kind of madlads uses it?
---
F
---
Oh no I had a post made of this but I was waiting for tomorrow! Seems like you beat me too it
---
You guys only say that because you dont have rosa
---
The most one-sided gamemode there is.

Updates don't come on weekends but videos can but I doubt it
---
Sc likes monday
---
Buddy thats not how mm works, if you are at 430 of course its going to match you with 300s still and 500s.
---
Almost 7k and missing 2 epics

Sunday or monday mark my words

jessie is like 4 what the heck

Dude holy shit this is so good :) Totally new art style to my eyes!

In beta we got updates every 3 months

Sorry but I can’t upvote because it’s at 420
---
I have 25/25 maxed brawlers with 14.7k trophy high, she’s broken
---
No one cares you probably got hard carried
---
An image and a video are 2 differant things bud
---
Nope
---
Thanks! I’m starting to love editing and will definitely make more stuff like this soon! :)
---
And even then people hate seige because of the harsh trophy drops when you lose, making it easy to tilt
---
Then get better at the game
---
Yes please
---
I'll draw it for you 👌👌
---
Being the star player made it extra sweet
---
Me: "How many trophies do you have? You don't deserve a single one"
---
Randoms: "I'm fwee" or "**** YOU **** I CARRIED YOU THE ENTIRE TIME AND YOU MADE US LOSE!" or *sobs* "HoW aRe YoU sO bAd!"
---
It would be toxic and I'm not sure that it would help as people would just yell at each other
---
lol
---
Im Daryl the barrel pirate
---
Thing is they all have the same drop percent either way so you’re just wasting it on a mega box
---
Good botte
---
Mortis by a lot
---
cool
---
Poor team. They're probably mad because they lost. They probably think your a thrower or something.
---
The wallpaper or the apps?
---
Yes....keep sharing this clip. We need supercell to take immediate actions...or they'll lose a lot of Indian gamers for sure! Lets make a stand!!!!

no, the december brawl talk was on Friday, I remember because I was in school.
---
I'm surprised these teamers still continue their own ways. Guess it's time for Supercell to do something bigger.
---
What if when she snapped, her own bear disappeared?
---
Son, you deserve a medal. Dismissed!
---
you dont even know if the word is retropolis
---
Leon at 13, Edgy as heck. This is really cool tho.
---
Your character dropped 1 platinum, 14 gold, 63 silver, and 5 copper.
---
It’s likely not his anyways. I remember seeing multiple videos like this before.
---
Sometimes you just gotta use a little less gun
---
Balancing her would kill 2 stones. Kill a broken Brawler and kinda kill teaming.  Although, I got my doubts that Supercell can actually do this. Their "nerf" on Rosa and teaming has hardly changed anything. They need to address this issue, Brawl TV highlights the issue for everyone to seem

A. I prefer brawl ball over siege

The wallpaper.
---
Funny, but not a very suitable format for this.
---
good idea! but what if about demonman with the loch'n'load and his super would be a sticky spam?
---
this joke is tara-bull
---
Don't ever use that word to describe engi's hand again
---
The majority of the community doesn't even like Heist in general. So you can guess their thoughts about this.
---
Yep. Makes me feel good when i spawn there.
---
I can win siege but brawl ball&gt;siege is 100% factual
---
Fact: Seeing the same joke daily makes it less funny, if it was ever funny at all.
---
So, we’re all just going to ignore the fact that this is obviously a set up, as this guy couldn’t even spell agent correctly in his fake picture?
---
Seems legit.
---
Yeah, sometimes randoms are very capable of doing smart moves, in brawl ball, it makes me happy when randoms actually try to work as a team, and cover low people, or especially pass the ball to the better ball carrier.
---
Welcome to rbrawlstars*
---
Maybe they paying special mode where you supposed to spin to stay alive?
---
Tits
---
First that isn't me, that's my friend DaddySD!. And second look at his Brock's trophies it's almost same and if you've played 600+ showdown you probably know how long it takes to find a match. So it's easier for them to exploit the matchmaking and my friend just happened to be playing at the same time they decided to do this.
---
Oh my god with this weapons she could have +25% range attack and ignoring of 90% damage
---
Thank you for answer. Does anything happen with trophies every season?
---
Yeah, usually the Rosas I match up against are bosses, but the ones on my team give me headaches
---
cool! Just followed you :D I think he'll edit it. But I still don't like the fact that he doesn't credit even when not told :/
---
This remind me one of the u/GEDI-KOR skin concept (april fool one)
---
If you have a brawler over 500, they lose half of the trophies over 500. So if your Carl is at 560, he drops down to 530.

Hahahahaha same!
---
Monday @ 4:00 EST
---
Why?... because I said so
---
ok but love the. ideas
---
I doubt she's gonna get a rework, but she definitely needs a nerf. Her, Carl, and gene are basically in every competitive game.
---
And nothing changes with total trophies if I don't have any 500+ brawler?
---
So now i see noting is impossible
---
Correct
---
This is my new map idea.
---
Actually it's not your village

Tnt blocks?

If you are on mobile, go into the posts feed and there's three dots in the top right corner. Pick that and select change flair. Voilà.

Ninja crow..
---
I mean BB is my favorite mode and siege is my least favorite so I’m not complaining
---
Pretty sure your knowledge about Indians is very limited.
---
Idk how it's weird, but you certainly outplayed them pretty well lol
---
F for Colt!
---
You need to carry harder or play on maps that favor Crow. He's not great in certain maps. If you don't want to carry pay Solo SD and team

Letters? Can i get caught up a bit?, havent heard the letters ( Like a letter, not the one that says about some sort of clue message)

This happens to me too on my Xiaomi Mi9.

I am not good at balancing brawlers, but i am sure that this is for max level brawler ( for accurate star power ) but it is op too when start to make the idea.

---
Why TF is Shelly running?
---
I got the same thing, lol.
---
 Hehe, wait, lemme explain u. 
---
The three guys tht fired the shelly, they do planned teamup in solo sd. They start the game in the same time, meet together in the start of the game and then they kill others nd share the points in the end. I myself am a random teamer, bt not a PLANNED TEAMER. I hope this much is clear for u. Now next, these guys after pushing through this  technique, term themselves as pros. It's like a guy winning exam with hella cheats nd then claiming tht he did it by hard work, where the real hardworkers get shit in return of everything they had done! Now, m not against teaming, coz randomly, it's upto a limit, since u see backstabbing and killing the weaker teamer. Bt in this case, even if u outplay someone nd provide him with a near-fatal blow, the other ppl will just defend the weaker guy. Think of u fighting someone, u nearly finish him off, bt then u see few other ppl getting in the ring nd killing u. Will tht be fair? It's not just me, it's the whole community that suffers coz of these noobs pushing high thru this nd then claiming themselves as pros! Nd even aftr all this, u think m also a culprit, well then, i'd be happy if supercell stops teaming up and bans my acc. Bt only after their acc. Getting banned! 
---
Ik they r planned teaming coz i have pics of them getting in the same matches in very near matches. Plus lets be honest, the rumours abt planned teaming have already been in the run for like months. It's just now tht i hv pushed my trophies enough to face these bustards in the real game!
---
You are probably going to get people supporting every single one. It’s anticipated that Crow May be getting a buff in the coming update, though not confirmed; you could anticipate this and get him. Otherwise, if I were you, I’d get spike.
---
You really can’t make a bad choice; just appreciate whomever you get and don’t let the haters get you down for not choosing a different legendary.
---
A level one Spike in mid rank BB?! I only played Spike till he was above 3k health lol
---
You don't have to be hardcore, and I'm not your buddy. It's a terrible financial decision. It literally makes no sense to drop that kind of in-game currency on a single brawler that doesn't improve your gameplay experience. You can buy 6 mega boxes at full value which would give you a high chance of getting any of the three, a shit load of gold, power points, and bonuses that include gems and tickets and token doublers. You would be an IDIOT if you did that. Heck even token doublers would still be better. That's an extra 100 boxes easy. Not including all the gems, tickets, and token doublers you get from them. Be smart. Those gems can help you upgrade brawlers, unlock more brawlers (even legendary), and have more tickets, extra gems and token doublers to help you push forawrd. Even a f2p could see that
---
Look closely at this profile, he has more wins in 3v3 than Showdown.
---
im at 11.5k trophies and i still dont have any legendery
---
Teaming is common and in india there is players have only 5,6k trophy then the top players are in same match and to win some matches we have to team all player are teaming in many matches in 3vs3 same team comes in 2 times in opponent ok thats why this is not a big deal
---
I have posted the clip , u can check tht out now.
---
Appreciate the insight man! Thank you!
---
Rosa but her Super makes her more Spike like
---
Not bad
---
Lil Frank's gang XD
---
Play smart and get good. Thats it no buts only shelly can 1 shot brawlers with her ult nothing else...
---
Yeah cool, bro. You get that feeling from your first legendary only.
---
I got Rosa’s Star Power last week, and I’m absolutely dominating every mode. It’s effortless. 
---
Seriously, either nerf her into oblivion, or just get rid of her. She’s seriously unbalanced.
---
I just... I had the widest, shit-eating grin while thinking about this in the car.
---
(Also, next part is finally coming soon! Sorry bout the delay. I had finals.)
---
Nice idea
---
.... talking about your penis size, dorin
---
Muie dorin
---
Well this thing is different brother, 😌 you are too low to understand and too young to even get this thing in your head. We are against planned teaming that's all. Random one is understood. Playing on VC and just straight out killing everyone is team of 4-5 is utter nonsense.
---
Typefault
---
I like it 👍
---
Well you need to learn a lot kid.. 😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣
---
Hands down Crow Or Leon. spike could be getting a buff in the next update and spike c a n be used in in different game modes but leon and crow can. honestly up to u which one is most fun. personally, i would go for crow
---
Wins are a lot harder to come by on showdown maps, if it showed top 5 places I'm sure it would be much higher.
---
I want this in the game because my change of getting a new brawler is incredible
---
Everybody got that offer noob
---
Well my bralwers are not that low ? How do you have so much experience then ??
---
Nu raspunzi, mue?
---
As far as a real answer if your dumbass decides to buy one, Leon is by far the best. Crow is the hardest and spike is the best middle ground. Crow is the most rewarding to win with. Spike has a lot of control. Leon is an assassin and has to be played like one but his high damage out put up close is devastating. For reference, I'm sitting at 13k trophies. I have all brawlers and all are at at least level 9+. Leon and Spike are at 10 and crow is at 9. Crow is my favorite. But by far Leon is the best.
---
Asa te-a invatat ma-ta?
---
How about with duo showdown when 1 person at the end of the game quits instead of hitting play again we dont put those two players back on the same team?
---
If they wanted to be on the same team they would have selected play again.
---
Mm dc nu raspunzi?
---
IGN?
---
Doesnt really fit, she's more like garnet
---
Absolutely the fuck not UNLESS 1) You're a YouTuber 2)Pro Gamer 3) Are Sponsored 4) Out of your damn mind 5) if you can ball out and not care.
---
thanks ^^
---
😳
---
you need to see endgame
---
mum, can I burrow your wallet for a second?
---
G E K O L O N I S E E R D
---
yes but instead of leon i have crow
---
this would be very confusing in the game
---
Ok ummmm
---
Shelly now super are more useful 
---
BUT THROWER...
---
Not sure what you’re reply is meant to say. I was summarising what the other guy said , not what I think.
---
Milk from bull
---
Wanna join the Leon Gang?
---
Leon is likely getting nerfed even more, and he's only good rn if you have him maxed with star power. Crow just got buffed and is amazing in nearly every mode, I'd go with him.
---
An upvote for the leg
---
Lol
---
Imagine to ruin a nice video with an annoying spinning
---
Don't do that unless she gets so nerfed that she barely wins without her star power
---
#tHeY dOnT giVe uS GeMs sO hOW caN wE buY lEgEnDaRieS?!?
---
Because its global offer
---
TL;DR 
---
I'd get spike for map control and be viable in many gamemodes. Get crow if you don't mind not getting kills and being annoying. Get Leon for a Daryl playstyle of hit-and-run on squishy brawlers.
---
I'd get spike. He is viable in Brawl ball, bounty, showdown, gem grab, and siege. His map control when behind a decent player is ridiculous. Epecially in showdown. His only real flaw is his squishyness, but I've faced plenty of spikes, and trust me, a good one is gonna be hell to get close to. With apike you gotta keep tour distance and angle your shots for the best results. You might want to get his star power, it can do wonders in hectic situations.
---
 I already have crow and imo he can only really be used in gem grab, bounty and showdown. Maybe brawl ball if you want to do one of those saves that's been trending on this sub. He might be best in showdown though up until 300 trophies. His poison when used by a decent player is annoying as hell though. Not to mention his absolutely devastating super. Like spike he's pretty squishy, so you gotta keep your distance, period. He also offers decent map control with his poison negating healing, but spike can hit around walls. Don't focus on his star power, its pretty bad imo. Don't expect many kills with crow. You mainly want to chip the enemy so your teamates can kill them, and use his speed to run away.
---
 Leon. I'm not too sure since I haven't faced too many, but what I can tell you is that he can chip and burst damage someone. Like the other leggys he's squishy, but his burst and invis can conpensate for that. You gotta play him like daryl pretty much. Only go after squishy brawlers for the most part. But his range let's you chip on tanks and medium to short rangers. He's decent in showdown, gem grab, bounty, and brawl ball. He's a hit-and-run play style. His star power is one you should try to get first.
---
Because ppl nit pick at every single detail that doesnt even matter. Its reddit.

Dude! Thanks for this great insight of their respective playstyles! Exactly what I’m looking for cause I’m not sure of how they’re to be played. So now maybe I’ll go with Crow for now. Base on your description of him that’s my playstyle. I dont  really go for kills but I just wanna help the team win. Thanks man!!

Obviously, you're better off buying him from the shop because you're more likely to get those mythics from brawl boxes before him and that's going to ruin your legendary chances, plus this offer rarely comes up again

Hurrrrr

When you team.

Hey, he can swing his shovel in both directions (͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

In simple words you were pre planned by your parents not random. So now tell me which side are you on ? Were you pre planned or Random ?

Can you answer this question ?

Cause both things are different. PRE PLANNED &amp; RANDOM

are two different words with two separate meaning.

I would say “buy spike” but I feel like that’s a bit biased lol.

Otherwise I will see what I can do... First is sleep

I agree but most of the time I am running from someone and either don’t have time to check the bush (my attacks need to charge) or there is no where else to go so most of the time there is a try hard Rosa in that bush
---
Yes it does, he says the box is in no map but it once was. So i  fact, yes it is used.
---
Yeah but i have played it for two and a quarter years and i don't want it becoming a shitty game like clash royale

Actually, quantum mechanics forbids this

Doesnt matter the amount of trophies

heck no

I agree its to wide, but they cant remove it completly, I would buff it by 1 less tile and thats it.

Siege is my s**t! I don’t care if I win or lose. I feel like it has the more intense battles.
---
Don't report anyone that post is on me and on him
---
Well basically yes, he’s not the best at all in the meta right now, before Rosa came out he was alright, a little crippled from so many nerfs.....now I’m not so sure. He needs a small buff, I love leon but he needs some help
---
He must be OP in the rain.
---
This is perfect
---
Nice Photoshop skills tbh lmao we don't even have to. Supercell never listens to trash 😂. Wbu you tryna convince the public we have clips of them in VC first thing they don't use discord lmao poking your ass in some ones personal life second we are contacting Novas Managers and you getting a nice talk with him lmao
---
By that logic then, a 3v3 mode with +1 and -1 as the rewards is what you would prefer?
---
Holy crap
---
An obvious one: When your enemies snowballed up to 30 bolts,  u know u’re gonna get it
---

I got a $50 iTunes gift card for my birthday. Who can guess what I'm about to do with it?

I love this concept, but please maintain the original blue background. :D

Speech 100
---
Are you higher up in trophies? People higher up tend to face each other a lot
---
Idk
---
I want to face palm and congratulate you both at the same time.
---
it is because she is a girl
---
I dont know, Maybe 500 coins for 1 gem will be more balanced 🙄
---
Pure RNG man. You just gotta wait it out.
---
Nice job cool idea
---
Buy your mother her late mothers day gift.
---
Yes
---
Dope!
---
delete it
---
Metoo😂😂
---
No they should because in duo if the other team has 10 or more power cubes there you actually have a chance if you invulnerable
---
The spinning in this video was just obnoxious because OP did it for 5 seconds straight lol
---
Is it the second one from the left and fourth from the top?
---
Found my identical twin i do kills liek taht woth colt and move to the opposite corner i shoot
---
Shelly trying to be rosa
---
Because I’m solo/duo SD it would be giving you more sight then people using the older model iPhones/androids, but the other 3v3 maps are only so wide so you don’t actually get any extra sight that would give you advantage.
---
Thank you Sunuku!
---
Heyyyy this is my first character concept!!!
---
Me and my friend do a lot of concepts that are so coooooool! This is one of them! :)
---
Wow never heard of that did you and your classmate team up in solo tho
---
That inator wouldn’t work.... as always
---
That's the Darryl gameplay I love
---
No it’s just that it is in front of mortis
---
I already did buy her one
---
Siege has spike socks and brawl ball which was the 1st new gamemode also had spike socks, no doubt a new gamemode is coming
---
You’re not supposed to have a chance unless you actually outplay them, otherwise they outplayed you by getting more power cubes, and you just won because you got handed a few seconds of invulnerability. Not really fair IMO
---

the pool is the sum of the possible variables. In this case in particular it is the set of all the objects obtainable

A legendary.
---
I think they will release tomorrow for some reasons.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
\- It passed 1 month since the last Brawl Talk
---
\- They are displaying letters in Brawl Star' TIK TOK account that means, in my humble opinion, RETROPOLY; so there is 1 letter missing = 1 day left.
---
Cheers
---
Good mobile edit 👍🏻
---
Like how you drew your character, it would really fit in the game! I have only a few complaints about the stats:
---
- 1s reload time would break the game, because you could easily spam attacks.
---
- 2000 damage for star power is way too much. I think 500 at most is enough
---
- I really like the super but I thing the damage in total has to be 1500 max at level 1 (so 750 damage per portal)
---
wtf I might as well keep it that way and get a mega box
---
This is the best goal humanity has ever scored in the history of goal-scoring
---
I feel you bro, im at -3500
---
I wish brawl ball was a permanent event tbh
---
Yeah I suppose she kept herself at a good angle to check as much of that are as possible.
---
But still the timing of her shots with me coming out from behind the wall were uncanny.
---
Its not based on trophies either. I used a 400 trophies gene and matchmaking teamed me up with a 70 trophies frank
---
I have 8 brawlers at 500. Bo, Crow, Frank, Rosa, Mortis, Piper, Penny and Poco. 9500 overall and I still miss 4 brawlers
---
If you shoot you should lose your invulnerability
---
It used to be 549 gems but now its 500
---
😭
---
They got some great shots off, but she sees you enter the bushes so can guess the movement you'll make. They miss a few too, which seems unlikely if cheating.
---
Wtf!
---
The Darryl rolls were awesome!
---
Fair enough! They were in the 500’s for a reason I suppose.
---
Trophy&gt;power because skill instead of character ability/strength
---
hopefully😜
---
True enough, I've had some godly games with piper before tbh, I'd love to see an accuracy rating after games.
---
There is no better feeling in this game than being on a roll with Piper.
---
Do any of these actually get put into the game? Genuinely curious. 
---
 
---
You've made SOOOO many of these, and they're so amazing but I don't think I've seen a single one in game. Isn't it kind of sucky that you put in all this work for it to not be used?
---
OMG
---
Pam is Colt and Jessie's mom!
---
Are you a pro or a sweat? Or do you actually miss mass tilting with randoms, unless you kick ass with randoms, I dont know
---
Tbh none of them are worth 30$ they are all good it just depends on your play style, crow is good at leaching people to death, spike is good it breaking grouped people and leon is an assassin good at close and mid range 1v1s
---
Obviously it means they will be selling spike socks in the merch store
---
I've had this with 3 people all in the shop day after day, I just need like 15k gold and I'm maxed out
---
I at least try to give ideas to help the Supercell developers
---
Or take my mom's credit card hahahhaa
---
It's so hard to get gold
---
They had a tournament that needed brawl ball yesterday day so it kept the same rotation
---
I agree with this. You can use your invulnerability to shield and tank for your teammates for a few seconds but as soon as you become an active combatant, you’re fair game to be hit.
---
Ok, so here is my advice
---
Crow: He is really good in showdown, you can basicly outplay anyone, but you have to stay at a bit a long range. This was the bralwer I got to 500 first.
---
Spike: Does a lot of damage both far away and close up. This is probably the hardest brawler of the three legendaries to play, but he is really good when you have mastered him.
---
Leon: You can push him to 300 in showdown within an hour. After this people will have learned to counter him pretty well, so you gotta play smart. He is amazing against basicly every brawler, but be aware of the shotgunners.
---
In my opinion you should buy either Leon og spike, but crow is also a good choice
---
Hopefully this was helpful
---
that's pretty common
---
But Frank just Twitted he is on long weekend vacation in France...
---
Wait why not?
---
I like how it's just over 10 minutes
---
Well then... this gets a downvote
---
I decided to get leon as I prefer showdown over 3v3
---
Sorta looks like Nova from the Marvel comics...great work!
---
There is lots of GREAT ideas but this is actually something we CAN expect to be included in the game; great job. 🙌
---
Yeah yeah yeah get your laughs out now I'll come back as the greatest Leon ever 😅😂
---
Yes this is true but maybe temporary bans would make them think twice about teaming
---
Hate siege
---
Great idea man!👍
---
750 is too much because it will leave another posion-equal dps after it's effect gone.
---
Jokes on you, I bought enough gems to be able to buy all three of them
---
Yep, I did
---
Yass, that's true
---
Kirby with a gun
---
I miss him😔⚘
---
Deals almost 1k damage
---
Welp this format used wrong again..
---
Night witch is supposed to say the good thing
---
At least you won...😂
---
Same
---
I remember getting to 4000 trophies and being excited about getting a mega box
---
maybe Monday
---
P2W 2: Paying to lose
---
I don’t agree cos I have a 500 rosa who is power level 3, so if other exploited ur idea and stayed on power level one. They would play new player who also have power level 1 brawlers
---
This is very wholesome and cute. Thank you.
---
I love the fact that he can go across water with his super. I am a Darryl main and have gotten several good kills that way.
---
Yeah I agree, this isn't my favourite map either. No idea why it hasn't changed to siege but I'm hoping permanent brawl ball is here to stay!
---
I think they took away siege so that they could test something new or changed in siege
---
Amen
---
Money hungry mmm jummy
---
I am isempt from any responsability because IT WAS A JOKE DON'T YOU GET IT. No, your meme is not funny cause it's not true. They actually listen to this dumb nursary of a community more than they should.
---
Dang, my bad, I haven’t been on the sub Reddit in a while so I haven’t seen.
---
No, he was saying that he was sorry.
---
....
---
If they add a new gamemode, i bet it will be capture the flag (or something like that)
---
Like they mean a sock like a flag
---
Msybe like pubg where you have a time limit. I did a thing where i leave 25 hp on all the robots as crow and i was so close when it kicked me
---
Right. I have 415 at level 3. My legendary characters aren’t even as good as her...
---
r/brockkgang
---
I think that Darryl is good as is, you just need to know how to use him.
---
dude: "you are toxic", also dude: "go kill yourself".
---
shouldnt mortis be in the rock and roll since he has rockabilly skin
---
No bots on r/brockkgang . We’re srry for the OG gang moderators declaration of war.
---
True
---
I think mortis needs a little range buff.
---
HELLO?? You have an emoji in your post but automoderator doesnt remove it?? What how is that possible?
---
 I just wish y’all would forgive Brock’s and convert to r/brockkgang
---
😂
---
I don't care
---
Lol ikr
---
I like it.
---
69th like yeah boiiii
---
I personally feel better after someone has killed me. It shows that they care that I have lost cups and have no hard feeling.
---
The el primo even stood still for two seconds before shooting the ball
---
Me neither.
---
Thats how it's suppost to be there is no hitbox in the center of brawlers for this reason ik it's messed up but that how it is
---
He uses it ;). r/brockkgang
---
###like this?
---
They were both trying to use their supers and didn't anticipate their teammate passing them the ball
---
Poyo!
---
Autoaim.exe
---
Are you trying to communicate with me?
---
Heist is great but gets very hard, especially with maps like todays
---
I wish I had 200 tickets. That's like 200*0.3= 60 boxes in robo rumble.
---
Hey I'm fine with it personally so... 😁
---
#Lol
---
wow such body, please take me. also go look for a doctor to treat that hurt butt.
---
Even so.. I auto aimed after the super n still hitting the other Crow.
---
Who is your electricion? I need to see him.
---
Wait how shelly and rosa can be child at the same time ?
---
But... how did you beat b-b-brick? ;-; r/brockkgang
---
Do you think it would be possible to do Zooka brock or piper? I just think that would be a great skin idea as well as warrior frank which is awesome
---
WATCH YOUR FUCKING PROFANITY
---
Nightmare fuel
---
yeah, that's the main thing, but he's too strong in showdown. Especially solos, because he can kill teamers so easily
---
how is this nsfw-
---
He THICC
---
Who would honestly pay around 30 dollars for one brawler compared to a new game lmao.
---
I think I might make a part two...
---
Whenever I see a piper on heist I just quit
---
Hehehehe yes!
---
*Stares directly into your soul*
---
Now you are saying that telling the TRUTH is being in denial. That is how it was like in 2016-17 Clash Royale.
---
NOT THE FACE! (or neck for that matter)
---
this theme doesn't fit with Brock or brawlstars very much. Shiba Nita because she has a bear that can be any animal, wizard barley because he throws stuff that lingers, but space police Brock doesn't work. maybe army Brock? find a theme that works with the brawlers attack and/or super and you may come up with better ideas
---
Ohboy
---
Im talking about the "team or get teamed" situation
---
he’s in my club.. tribe gaming
---
Ok. Ill be like EVERYONE ELSE and ignore a big problum. Promoting a bully is what everyone is doing. I actually wanted to stop this issue before it gets out of hand, but it seems like it already did, and nobody wants to care.
---
That's how mafia works.
---
No but I just got home from school and im just starting to sketch the head
---
What'd you get in the mega box?
---
NICE IDEA...
---
This is why i started saving my gems 5 months ago
---
Well in that case it's true , I just picked passage because it was the current showdown map while I was making it
---
Bug, i have do it, but in bots if you see in my channel: Ra555, and you search for the video calles como jugar 3 en supervivencia, you can find it, im spanish so the video is in spanish but you can see and maybe understand it
---
I’m at 10k and I’m not stopping lol
---
Can you elaborate in detail on how you think people are hacking? Maybe that will help.
---
That must really suck. 800 people watching you get your ass kicked.
---
It's worth it with anew brawler
---
*T H I C C A*
---
Probably because they keep losing, but I dunno, I enjoy it too even with the high risk. I do think it needs a slight rework though
---
The girl making a facebook site on popular people who bullied her.
---
That map is a good one for Barley, Darryl, Colt/Brock/Jessie
---
Nice
---
 Star colt skin! Could be 2019 skin!
---
Yeah, hit 5k trophies just now, no new brawler._.
---
Sure! I would love too.
---
Usually its the small things you would not notice, loke a little extra health or damage.
---
Others are a little more noticeable, like healing when you attacking them instead of damaging, or a 4th ammo slot
---
Or even worse, straight up teleporting.
---
And lets not forget the worst of them all, using a command to straight up kill someone. I call it “/kill” and its annoying as all hell. You hide and are safe. Then they just type it in and you are done, no questions asked
---
I hope this helped!😁
---
No.
---
Leon is hiding something that can change the brawl stars world...
---
Somebody fed him some good portions of salt before posting this
---
The problem with siege is that whichever team gets the lead will most likely win. Once they start snowballing it's pretty much over. There is barely any comeback mechanism in the game mode like gem grab or brawl ball.
---
Ikr lol.
---
She doesn't
---
Still dude, to have all of em 500 is pretty crazy. I'd love to play some games with you, and get some tips.
---
Still got 172 gems left
---
I got the same deal as you did but I already have Spike. I'm also F2P.
---
Lol 
---
Its a bit outdated but search 
---
Shelly then and now
---
Bull then and now
---
Etc
---
Ops lol
---
Damn, that's impressive. I love it!
---
2017 humor
---
When I make this joke I get down voted lol. Have an upvote.
---
They don’t have to spend money. They could have just played for the tokens daily and gotten lucky
---
Praying a lot doesn’t necessarily mean skill
---
Just because you all dont like siege does not mean they should take it away from everyone, but i understand how you are intimidated by its more complex and unforgiving gameplay. I love all game modes, y'all should be more inclusive ;)
---
the forth one wouldnt make sense ( the jumping one) because dynamikes’s star power is literally that.
---
You are a good player
---
I woke up thinking seige was back, but it was brawl ball. I’m sure everyone is happy!
---
Rosa's movement speed is 770, Crow's is 820, so she can't catch up. You're probably referring to her really long range, which everyone agrees is too much.
---
I care
---
Capture the Spike sock
---
Yes please!!!
---
OP posting and drawing smth about the state of balance patch and here half the reaction are some feminist lvl answer about color skin...
---
same
---
Who doesn't?
---
Thanks for the help!
---
Dune Drift FTW
---
Yeah I wish it was brawlball forever.
---
Are you willing to sell these?
---
My problem are the people who run the ball back to our goal and kick it in for the team. I see this at least once every five matches. 
---
I don’t understand why people even queue for the game type if they are just going to grief their own team.
---
^(yes primo gives us the gems)
---
I know. Just putting it out there.
---
I concur
---
At least thats a Rosa and Rosa is decent in brawl ball
---
11141 :D
---
I too prefer to win a game over loosing one.
---
Agreed!
---
Ik but that's after the nerf.
---
Lol.
---
That is not my experience. most games I get one player who actively runs into a corner near our goal and refuses to participate. 
---
One in five matches I get a player that actively tries to get the ball and once they do, they take it back to our goal and score for the other team. 
---
It’s infuriating.
---
Now that takes dedication. 
---
I believe the most game I did with one random is around 20ish and that took close to an hour already
---
