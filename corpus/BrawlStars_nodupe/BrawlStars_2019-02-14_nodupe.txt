What MulTVrse said. I also play with randoms mostly, cos I want that added challenge. Credit to supercell where credit is due, matchmaking has improved A LOT. 
---
Brawlstars is like real sports. Unless you are all elite level players, there‚Äôs no way you can get away with not playing as a team. And even if you are, you‚Äôre usually found out when playing against moderately strong players who work as a tight unit.
---
So if you are playing randoms and lose a high percentage of the time, it just means that you‚Äôre skills are not enough to carry your team if you need to. I.e. it‚Äôs a fair reflection of your skill level. Let‚Äôs not kid ourselves.
---
The only way to overcome this is you have to look inwardly and identify the areas you can improve. 
---
I too went thru a horror spell as well recently where I was stuck with Tara playing for 20 odd hours before I overturned a 80 plus trophy deficit.
---
Then I proceeded to drop another 70 trophies with colt and again, another close to 20 hours of grinding to get back again. 
---
It was really painful and I had the bruises to prove it ‚Äì I literally raged and headbutt random shit out of sheer frustration ‚Äì but ultimately I became a better player through the experience. Not by much, though lol, and I expect to have to go through these mini slumps again in order to go to the next level.
---
If you choose not to ‚Äògrow‚Äô with a club by constantly interacting and learning from other teammates then the learning process is a lot harder. But I understand from what you said that you want to play in a certain way. Fair enough. Just don‚Äôt give up if you love the game. You deserve better.

Ok, thanks!

I think this is a case where Darryl hunted Nita and skinned her to use as clothing.

Unite

Because to overcome all this they had to overbuff him.On top of that tanks got harsh nerf with the new map and permanently destructible grass.

1 million trophies. It do be like that

Maybe they were refreshing the app from lag, it‚Äôs unfair to kill them outright.

It allows the pros to advance their skills as well. Changing how they play based off this idea.

I will be like bill, but because of his hat

Same as Magic Archer from CR

and a very good one, apparently mythics have very slightly lower chances than legendaries (at least for me)

What about Piper?üò¢

he killed nita.... daeth to him eeee
---
Definitely not as frustrating as emotes, it‚Äôs funny if anything.
---
True, but mortis is already the genitive of mors. The second declension genitive plural is mortorum.
---
He looks like my grandpa lol
---
It would be cool if only your teammates could see it but giving that much information to the enemy is a bad idea.

That would also work, but it might make him very similar to mortis in that regard.

Once I was in match as Frank and there were 7 Brawlers teaming (I was one of them obviously), and the zone was very small, and... You know what happened next 
---
Just stay in bushes and avoid open engagements (avoid bounty all together with all tanks except daryl). Play super agro on boxes and brawlers within 1 tile except shellies

There's a small difference between 5 and 7 and a big one between 5 and 11-16

yeah he can 2shot boxes now, not even bull can do that. only pam and darryl can

I thought the poco skin wasn‚Äôt working, but the effects do work in any game mode. In friendlies with bots, none of the effects work for some reason. Hopefully supercell fixes this.

You used to be able to see Santamike in the skin options before (after the event of course) even if you didn‚Äôt own it but it appears to have been removed recently 
---
Unless this is just happening to me

Does anybody else notice this? Also, for those of you who don‚Äôt own Nita and Penny‚Äôs skin, are you still able to see them?
---
I absolutely love healing mushrooms. They're honestly the best mod.

Calm down man, I mean it's just a meme template, you can see people reuse each other's template a lot on other subs like r/dankmemes or r/prequelmemes.
---
Seems accurate. Well can someone change the gun in the second panel into dynamite? 
---
Weeeeeeelll we all have to kill eachother eventually. I feel gaining trust and backstabbing to be 100% more effective than dying from a range with no possible way to survive...
---
*Spins faster than the earth spinning around*

Brock #1
---
gem grab might not be the best idea since darryl and mortis exist, but hes still an ok option. heist and hot maze/stormy plains are your best options
---
This is kinda why I first gain some trophies thru SD then I start going into Gem Grab, Bounty or Heist :/
---
actually, this is relatively fair matchmaking compared to others. lol.
---
What i hate is people Team Up for solo showdown and they need to Team Up if there is a option to play duo showdown 
---
hit em with the #facts

That's amazing!

Can Brock really three shot Darryl? He has to use four shots to kill Shelly.

I play her a lot in showdown. She is niche in some bigger maps. You just need to be very aware of the surroundings (especially Leon, that hoodie guy hurts so much and fast af) and not waste too many shots at once
---
Thanks for the info, it clears out that high rarity heroes can be obtained from any box, hope I just get lucky eventually. Appreciate your time in responding to my noob question! :)
---
True, but i only find worth in the 200 ones from brawl boxes and the ones in the shop(but only if they have a discount, 50 gems is too much)
---
exactly why did OP waste all 3 shots on a box first play
---
Most bulls just camp in a bush and insta kill anyone who comes near, which ruins the game for other players
---
Take the El r/dynamikegang
---
I know teaming is just a method like another but still, it's just unfaire tolose 7 trophies because 3 dynamikes teamed against you,Showdown should be a skill based gamemode, not a ''Win free trophies'' game-mode.
---
I think each 500hp healing should help build his super as if it was damage. If it's too op then bring it back to 400hp.
---
Looks kinda messy but nice concept
---
Thanks man
---
Enemy gene should be Will Smith
---
Try duo showdown instead 
---
From my personal experience it is at least 40% less trash than solo
---
6 is more of a problem than you think....
---
I love spike and the skill needed to really make him amazing, but when the game first came out I loved Nita and Poco so I‚Äôm going to go with a 3 way tie
---
eu tamb√©m
---
he could have 3 shot the box if he was at max range and if he had saved shots he maybe could have been able to fend off the leon
---
Try going into duo and using poco only use your attacks to heal your partner.
---
Its bc he didn't have his super. C'mon there literally isn't a smart random primo.
---
Barley and Dynamike‚Äôs wet dream
---
I know the community loves showdown, but for us that like heist and brawl ball, to only get those every other day and for showdown players to have 2 maps some days just seems a little unfair already. I feel that having two permanent showdown maps would be very unappealing to alot of people
---
Its a bull, i dont feel so good,
---
How is this karma?
---
I think he‚Äôs referring more to the 7K 8K range. I know for some of my brawlers I need to get 4th to get trophies which kind of feels cheap 
---
by placing 6-10
---
New skin idea?
---
Imagine not reacting fast enough to avoid the shot
---
No, this just plain assault. 
---
would be nice if there is a hole in the drink cup, it's spike the cactus tho
---
Its funny cause of how good mortis is.
---
El primo is here

Looks like its something from Aladdin, looks cool too

How do you make skins like these? And then put them on a "3D" model??

---
##d i s g u s t i n g
---
How did you gain most of your trophies? Primarily gem grab?
---
This argument is making me cringe. I actually know somebody who has played right before event modifiers were a thing, and he has no mythics or legendaries.
---
Why the downvotes
---
\*furries trample the streets in desperate origin of this picture\*

I was just talking about the 60x free token doubler and even then it's just a joke

I push everyone evenly, so i dont know right now. Probably shelly at 425.

the template isnt overused but it isnt good, and this joke is repeated at least 50 times a day on this sub

Thanks peter!

That too üòÇ
---
There should be something that tells you how many times youve been star player 
---
Yep. F is correct.
---
Yeah definitely. I‚Äôve never gotten that before and I‚Äôm around 7k trophies, I think that‚Äôs totally fair
---
Oof. Was so close to saying‚Äù thats actually fair‚Äù because 90% of all ‚Äúmatchmaking‚Äù post are actually fair. Glad to find an exception.
---
Turn that frown upside down
---
Thanks, üòä i had that idea for a while but didnt know if it was a decent/valid idea because i dont own him yet, so i could only base it off of encounters with him
---
Hell ya
---
Definitely wanna see playtime and brawler since!
---
It‚Äôs based on Buddhism beliefs or something like that idk 
---
I didn't know we can get this deep
---
I‚Äôll screen record the part where I gain trophies and send it to you if you want more proof.
---
They are all rolling.
---
):
---
Well if she didn‚Äôt use all her shots and stayed farther back she may have been able to get super and keep leon back long enough to survive

Don‚Äôt underestimate him tho, a smart crow can outplay most

---
Huh? 
---
Just because he is balanced better than leon or crow doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs balanced, he would be the best brawler in the game (debatable with Pam, but her spread requires more skill than spike) if it weren‚Äôt for leon
---

---
Same here, please explain OP
---
If you see a huge team, join them. Most of the time they‚Äôll accept you. And you wont loose trophies!!!!!
---
Modding is against the tos, fyi
---
So you‚Äôre rewarded for playing aggro instead of playing strategically. 
---
There‚Äôs nothing skillful about bull rushing to the middle, easily grinding out 5 jars and then running around killing the rest of the players. 
---
Showdown rewards strategy. Teaming is a strategy. Camping is a strategy. And yes, playing Bull and being aggro is a strategy. 
---
But showdown is already a very skewed mode where only a handful of brawlers are viable without extreme consequences for misplays. 
---
So no, 1 trophy per kill doesn‚Äôt solve any issue. If you have a problem with people camping seek them out.
---
Exactly !! That's my point too ... They wouldn't want to risk losing their new players for the sake of existing players.

Exactly I don‚Äôt like how people are moderating how others play. Scavenging and stealing kills is ok but camping in a bush is bad playing aggro tank is good but teaming is bad. Like let me play how I want to play

My theory is that they want us to get uaed to teamers &amp; I don't want the future of whuch contains 0% teaming.

Do u think a chill vibe suits the game type or it wouldn‚Äôt work 
---
Dude, why do you think the other guys were spinning, if not taunting or making fun of him because they tought they had it in the bag?
---
They could easily go to him and kill him instead of making fun of the situation, but they were clearly taunting, so it's clearly bm. it's the same as teabagging.
---
Thank you ‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
We're is a bug?
---
This image is cursed
---
powercubes lol not elixir
---
Each big = 3 brawl boxes, so 7 = 21, plus the 75 brawl
---
Seems like bape
---
pfft this is fake never seen one of those
---
Kiss me
---
i do this with piper and darryl ;-;
---
Thank you :)

Me too :)

seems Im the only one who doesnt get new brawlers :(

Man, talk about last frame takeout. It began to say match over right as you took out Poco. Cool vid! üëç
---
Perfect remodel!!!
---
It was disabled because of the matchmaking bug on Boss Fight
---
Brawl stars = tf2 (?
---
Hope they add new modes ... We need more exiting things to do in game and this concept Is Amazing
---
how do you turn that on
---
Buff crow
---
I honestly think he should get a rework to his super but keep the same "Assassin Engage Jump Ninja Cool Ganster Crow" thingy. Also making him a Raven and calling him Raven is a buff of it self :)
---
You can buy it for a discount in the shop (270 iirc) 
---
I feel it should cost 250 or 200 at the very least cos it has one of the coolest and most extensive remakes of any brawler (look, attack animation and effect, hell even super was changed) 
---
That would make it quite accessible to those who spend the time saving up for it (esp with discount) while remaining a revered skin to those who don‚Äôt 
---
Coming from a proud owner of phoenix crow who pretty much saved a whole year for it (its worth the wait!) 
---
Thanks a lot. Hope Supercell will notice this üòã
---
You could just not play it...
---
Apparently it was too easy to gain trophies, but I still want it back
---
You mean team fortress? 
---
You sick monster 
---
I would no life tholis srsly supercell should add this
---
yes!
---
I loved it! But when the new remodels are released, I can already see the flood of posts asking " BriNg BaCK bO!", "bRInG BaCK PiPeR!".
---
Ils ne peuvent pas faire quelque chose comme √ßa parce que si ils impl√©mentaient un syst√®me de signalements avec des punitions pour les personnes signal√©es, des personnes pourraient signaler quelqu‚Äôun qui n‚Äôa rien fait et qui les a juste tu√©es en showdown 
---
Yes
---
*OVERWATCH VIETNAM FLASHBACKS* NOOO GENJI GET THE FUCK BACK HERE
---
Thats some beautiful hair right there
---
No screen time plz...

Ah good to know, Piper has been added to my hit list (not sure if Pam got a remodel yet, if not then her too).
---
#I WA‚ÄîI WAN‚ÄîI WANT MY MOMMY

Damn you're lucky, how many trophies do you have? 
---
It‚Äôs so good and finally got that thread in his bo

---
I regret that I stopped playing it a year ago 
---
Holy crap this looks amazing! you are ridiculously talented 
---
Great 10/10
---
She never had a remodel but i think Pam was always perfect as she it
---
Wait... how much do u play daily
---
Same
---
LOL I was like auto aim op but he missed so hes like nah I screwed up ima play it cool and just loose then I thought he was gonna loose or attack leon from behind and saw the ending üòÇüòÇ
---
More like teaming bruh

No more spike skins ‚Äò-‚Äò
---
#You should‚Äôve then twirled around at the last seconds, revenge is a luxury.
---
Thank you! :) 
---
yeah that was the old heist
---
Nah its an error on supercells side, they still havent fixed it...
---
I don't like it.  The information is spread too far apart, looks unorganized and is harder to make sense of
---
are u rarted
---
Can we get an F for Pam Gang
---
Lol Fix ur grammar and explain it clearer.
---
That's cute! 
---
They will probably remove his hat :/ ... loved your concept by the way
---
It will be good only if teammates can see that so randoms can cooperate a little better.
---
If enemies can see that it will affect the competitive in a negative way, having a deep knowledge about the game, like how may hits are needed to charge X brawler's super, it's essential for pro gamers, also you can use it as an advantage and can be part of your strategy.
---
Seeing when a super was ready and when is selected it's enough
---
Sees Nita and Jessie.      Yes it's this guy officer.
---
Also a mortis was getting teamed on and I was thicco so I helped him out but sense I can't team i ended up giving him third
---
Thanks! And yeah the threadless bow always bugged me a bit
---
Oh wow here I am sitting at 7,7k with no lengendaries

Expecting to see Heavy Metal Poco!! üé∏

#ROCKET *RAAAAAAAIN*

52 in total how do you guys have so many?
---
Do you have any advice for me? I have 9 brawlers with under 200, should I push them up no matter how good I am with them?
---
I shipped it 
---
With bushes on in the map everythig is possible
---
You got all legendaries and no mythics!!!
---
Jessie and Brock are so cute!
---
lmao...I have been saving boxes for almost a month
---
Yes it is
---
Aww, too bad. The way they have it isn't the best, but it would be an awesome opportunity to link Bo and Nita together in some way.
---
Yeah it's bad... I wish they never made this change, hopefully this doesn't just die down and more ppl complain about it
---
Looks cool but a little squished down the bottom
---
Penny would be a god if her cannon is left untouched in this mode
---
^/s
---
Good....if I add up the boxes(of both the IDs and the trophy road boxes)...I would sit at around 230 boxes
---
I see there's a mistake, Bo's bow doesn't have string üòÇ
---
I have been saving since gene was announced
---
No
---
Pooled matchmaking is a terrible idea... Now playing a new brawler will be frustrating as hell above 8k trophies...

If people chasing me all over the map, I should kill them, or i will die, IT IS SURVIVAL

I never bush camp unless I‚Äôm about to die, I got an average of I‚Äôd say 7 power ups each game

crow's is actually too good

no please i have 6k waiting for gene and i cant waste any

How rare are they? I have a legend but no mythic or epic

i was talkink about the cards but oküòÖ

There's no deaths only the change of World!

Oddly looks like the characteristics of a few maps combined and this is what happened, but it is awesome.

Weird name though.

Theirs a saying called if you can‚Äôt beat them join them but yes teaming is a problem but the mortis_gang always work together

Wrong ships nuuuu

I respect ur opinions tho

I ship

Rico x piper

Nita x Leon

Colt x Shelly (yeet)

Pam x bo (IDK why) 
---
thanks for 1k upvotes on the pic lol, getting back to home from a crappy day and seeing it made my day so much better, the funny comments, the sweet compliments, the useful feedbacks,... everything is just &lt;3 ( i know its cringy but thats really how i felt lol )  
---
heres the youtube version if anyone wanna watch it idk :P :[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk83VD5pxK0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk83VD5pxK0)
---
Maybe do it for a week and if it works stay, but if it mane the game bad, take it out. (I mean here like in Fortnite "glider re-deploy was in for a few weeks and than removed cause the ppl. didn't liked it. 
---
You teamed a bit too against bull!! Hahaha 
---
Thanks)
---
BUFF CROW
---
The chance you Play with random and encounter a good teammate is smaller than the chance of getting a legendary brawler
---
(You can do this by changing the locale setting.)
---
You just unlocked him and you want to dominate with him ffs
---
Wait, what? I thought this already happened. 
---
Big to small... but this strategy is not that useful as you just get like 0.001% to 0.005% more luck
---
idk man, nita and frank look like fire mages attacking now, not quakes
---
No, he is mythic
---
False. It was a bush camping bull in gem grab. And bounty. And also showdown.
---
#***CAN WE GET A BUFF FOR CROW NEXT BALANCE***
---
Nah, is a mythic you can se it confirmed in Frank's (Brawl Stars developer) Twitter 
---
Definitely. Add something like clan wars in clash royal (club wars?) with prizes like gold, gems, boxes, keys like in season reward, possibly even something like club brawlers which you can level up every time you win a match
---
Nah it would change the dynamic of showdown too much 
---
Frank said on Twitter that they‚Äôre remodeling every brawler besides the ones that were remodeled in December or January (Shelly, Nita, Bull, Brock, Dynamike, Barley, Rico, Leon, Colt, Poco, Mortis, Spike and Gene).
---
I'm not main Darryl or high trophies, but I play him at showdown a lot. Normally I start very aggressive to stop them of teaming up in large numbers. They can't team up if they are dead. *WeSmart*
---
I'm not a fan of it, but I'm not sure of a solution either. I've seen arguments on both sides of the issue that have valid points. 
---
I will pay u 100 dollars if u allow me to slap u
---
ÎÇòÎäî Îî∞ÎùºÍ∞ÑÎã§ Í∑∏ÎÖÄÎ•º

Nono, you lowered his hp so he can use his Star power ;)

Colt and shelly ‚ù§Ô∏èüòçüòç

Mortis gang rise!

How could anyone know?

Bruh Nita is 19 and Leon is 10!?!?
---
GENE

Buff Bo I had had to tilt because of his star power nerf
---
Looks like you slaughtered a Braviary (Pok√©mon) and stuck it to its head
---
But why is his background blue?
---
Sorry, i'm not well at English, cuz it's not my first language
---
500 couldnt be enough never know with luck and your percent chance :((
---
Oh my.. gimme dat! Now. :)
---
Compliment to the water mark as well :)
---
They'll be extra toxic if you don't buy it
---
Betrayal!
---
dude its so awesome! i'd love to see this in game!! its gonna make bo look like a member of the shaman family or something.... which is really cool!!  i just love it... supercell should give a response to this post! Great work!
---
Because he isn't officially released yet
---
I just loved it !!!‚ô•Ô∏èüòéüëå
---
Of course, this is way better imo!
---
Agreed
---
Why would piper suck? She can kill almost every single brawler with all 3 shots if used correctly, and every single one if her star power if used.
---
She can deal enough damage to frighten most brawlers, and she is arguably the best brawler in bounty.
---
She can be implemented in gem grab as an amazing support, and she is even usable in heist, as she can deal  up nearly 10% damage to the safe if you have a high enough level
---
üò£
---
thats just the color they use for not released brawlers yet..made everyone go nuts because of this 
---
Doesn‚Äôt he need to hit the enemy brawler to heal? Also heals are greatly reduced, you won‚Äôt heal as much per hit and if you hit the enemies many times, they‚Äôd be dead anyway.
---
What does this have to do with Brawl stars
---
Yeah i too  tink so because while playing i notice that other players to get freezed 
---
no emotes pls.. emotes are cancer ‚ôã
---
Better name : the roundabout 
---
Aaaaw so cute, I love it!
---
Would you rather be trapped in snake prairie with 9 max level Bo's or be a dynamike in a game with all Mortis
---
I hope
---
Found the Supercell design team 
---
Bo
---
Where's Piper and rico?:/
---
Showdown takes too long to load!!! And Whenever Brock supers in SD it lag spikes!
---
FIX THESE BUGS PLEASE!
---
Would you rather go up against a 10 power up bull as a 1 power up Rico or a 1 power up mortis as a 10 power up dyna
---
his username and the name in the gam end screen is the same, he probably just wanted to see how global players will respond
---
Lmao, I got 70 regular and 4 big.
---
But he‚Äôs still balanced because is low hp is a huge disadvantage. Crow is a legendary so most people that are using him are super good. Don‚Äôt get discouraged 
---
These guys are just wanting to become famous by stealing someone else's work. I smell plagiarism
---
Lol he'd very underpowered
---
I meant to say "and post it to you so you could also see it".
---
WOOOOOW just wow!
---
THE BEST MAP))))
---
I just can't bring myself to save them because I'm still missing all the epics (and I have all other brawlers except Spike and Crow)
---
He is a mythic.
---
good format
---
Ya maybe...
---
I thought this was real lmaoo
---
When the offer goes out, the skin will turn into a 150 value!! :v
---
Viet Cong Poco

wow hands down best fan idea about remodel concept

I'm studing french but I can't undrstand you. English please. 
---
THICCOCHET
---
Great art! But
---
Colt+Shelly actually true
---
Bull+Penny, uh oh never thought of it cause Bull+Pam=Colt &amp; Jessie
---
Jessie and Brock are cute but not OK to make a couple with a 10 y old. Would prefer Brock and Piper
---
Bo and Nita? He is her father, Tara is her mother, and Leon is her brother. So no pls no
---
Enemy vs ours
---
They look like fire mages when they are not on your team... When they are, they look like water mages
---
First game after launch, if played on Showdown, still takes much longer than usual to load after the Gene update. I had it once load AFTER I got killed. Before the update, the game would load instantly. It seems to only affect Showdown for me, though.
---
Poco is over 400
---
If one person in a battery uses a brawler that has 400 or more trophies, then everyone can see the replay. In your case, it was the Poco.
---
Ok this is EPIC
---
Badass Pam
---
I mean it looks good but I don't think I like the idea of him shifting from being like a wildlands hunter (kinda like rexxar from WoW/Hearthstone) to an Apache archer
---
Nope
---
I agree on Rico... But I disagree on the others tbh.
---
thx!
---
It's true....
---
But we don't suck!!!
---
Oh papa. Can u give ur credit card number again pls
---
Love your art man....ever since I've been playing BS I loved your art.
---
Idk what vid I've seen then, but the UI looked way better. 
---
LMAO I love how it tells you Brock is a girl and penny is a dude
---
They must play it to get a star key
---
Looks really interesting!
---
Should also add win/loss ratio just because
---
The only game mode in which teaming wasn't too popular and they removed it!!!!!!
---
Well I'm new to reddit so you dont have to be jerks about it
---
Because SuperCell saw that most players didn't play Leach Life as much as every other gamemode, because they don't like it much and decided to cancelled it to make room to better gamemodes. 
---
I know It prevents teaming, but it's much more frustrating and unbalenced
---
In English there's should be perfect, not ideal
---
I don‚Äôt believe so.
---
Yea
---
Ohh
---
U got 99 balls and a piper aint one ‚òùÔ∏è 
---
–û, —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–µ

-75% heal like poco,mortis,pam,spike
---
Thanks for telling me! Really helpful. 
---
She tells me two‚Äôs enough. With an odd number of balls I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to have her leave me
---
Also, I‚Äôm new to Reddit how did you get the mortis thing next to your name?
---
I see It more like a skin on Bo.I do not think that Bo needs a remodel at this moment.
---
yeah it used to be 2D some prefer that it was pretty neat
---
Same here. : (
---
Take my upvote
---
Love all the downvotes from the salty folks who have no idea how to juke or conserve ammo for defense in showdown. Enjoy your 3200 trophies I guess.
---
Just hate people who spam cry emote when they winning &gt;:(
---
Playing with good randoms.
---
Mythic!
---
Can you add it as an event modifier with another showdown map on and see how it goes
---
I didn‚Äôt save anything. I don‚Äôt get new brawlers anyway. What makes me think I‚Äôll get that one...
---
LMAO üòÇ 
---
I brought her shelly down to 280 from 440 and same with bull. But now I'm logged out automatically and donno how did it happen. One can't revoke access in supercell ID but can revoke in gmail. Biggest mistake of my life was linking game to supercell id
---
Would be heavily abused unless they turn off regen.
---
So a moving old heist 
---
Thank you !!! I‚Äôm not stressed, brasil is country of makinf fun of others... lol !! Cheers buddie, thanks for the correction !!!! :)
---
- me after losing 20 trophys to get the startoken, rage quitting brawlsstars and browsing the subreddit
---
Like Lifeleach?
---
I think they should just make the gem to coin exchange go both ways. So when you are maxed and all you are getting is coins you can turn those into gems. Maybe the ratio for coins to gems is worse than gems to coins?    
---
With all these offers in the shop containing coins(like the lunar new year) it would make those useful to people who are maxed and they would be more inclined to buy them.  
---
I'm not gonna hold my breath though, I doubt they would add something like this because it would make it too easy to reliably farm gems.
---
No we can't have this remodel!  Crow will get scared :(
---
&gt;but it isn't practical
---
There's a robot bartender that throws poison molotovs at people. There's a dead mariachi. I don't think practical is a requirement.

This is a repost

I've already commented more than once about power level differences, but this is an good example of the issues in running into. this is only one of about 15 or so similar screenshots of power level differences. I really think matches would be a lot more entertaining and competitive if levels were a bit more consistent.

Is it an Easter Egg?

*looking at jessie* yes this post right here officer
---
Laughs in Auto Aim.
---
Idk probably

That‚Äôs funny because I just had this game and you can clearly see my name in the video 
---
They have star power, but stats are level 1
---
Put a question mark because I thought I saw it with another title
---
Gene comes when the next gem grab map changes
---
When the game was launched, there was no mute button. So you have to deal with those annoying stuff. plus there's those high level players who would get defeated on purpose so the lower level players are spammed with these players with cards that were only available on the upper levels. Obviously the matchmaking system was broken. Uninstalled that game a few months after. I installed it again when I linked my BrawlStars account to Supercell, just so I could link my account there, played it for a day and uninstalled it afterwards. I didn't miss it at all.
---
This game to me is fun. While playing with randoms can be annoying at times, I didn't have that same sentiment as I had with Clash Royale. If they put stuff like this in this game, well, I will gladly bow down and say, Thank you, Next.
---
True, but keep in mind CR didnt start off at 20000, they introduced more cards, new chests, trades, all kinds of other things that put it to the price it is now over 2 almost 3 years. I stick by my "for now"
---
Sometimes it isn't. And on this meme it 100% isn't 
---
I play this game since beta, that‚Äôs why I can save boxes, if you open them while you are maxed you only get gold
---
Never stop dreaming buddy!
---
You did a fantastic wipe, but all of them still gained trophies because they teamed, except for that barley that you smeared all over the walls.
---
Do you mind if I ask some general questions?
---
I was playing on a crappy phone that 1. glitched, 2. took forever to load, 3. straight up ignored half my commands, and 4. made all entities (players, robots, boxes) invisible.  I was 'our barley'
---
Today I got a new one that plays normally.  I'm still 'our barley', but occasionally I accidentally fireball an enemy or something.
---
thats tough dude. who else do you need?
---
Where do the players spwan?
---
Yeah that‚Äôs high but it‚Äôs all luck 
---
I like the idea,but I think the team has better things to focus on, still tho nice idea!
---
It's all a matter of preference, I actually prefer keyboard but I respect your opinion :D
---
Why does the deleted comment have so many downvotes?
---
Several original brawlers still have no skin 
---
I was referring to other people in this thread thinking this way, thanks for the downvote though.
---
That‚Äôs really good...
---
I teamed because the other two teamed plus if you play sd above 450 trophies you will always be teamed in lost 50 trophies with piper because of a team of 6 sucks to team and is un fair bit you can‚Äôt do anything else otherwise you will just lose trophies :(
---
The people I played against were teaming too üòÇ
---
That‚Äôs definitely a fair point lol 
---
I‚Äôm still trying to pull that stunt myself 
---
Deserved for using low quality memes
---
Only Crow and Spike, got really lucky with my drops (got Leon from lvl25 pack and and Mortis from lvl35) but I really like the epics üòÑ
---
Someone‚Äôs mad cause realized they made a mistake
---
I like the extra little detail with the brawlers trophy count color being correspondent to the medal it‚Äôs next to! Amazing job my dude!
---
Well it's just like 5 bucks,  just 5 it won't hurt...... Mom I'm going Bankrupt
---
cute :)
---
It's okay then, just apologize and you'll be fine dude
---
I like your first suggestion. It is better and more detailed than mine. Specifically radius and tactical responsibility division of every brawler sounds great. Thanks for comment üòÑ
---
I just got that for colt.
---
Oh damn you sure got me bro
---
Imagine being this sensitive 
---
This is so cute
---
Mortis in gem grab must be played as an aggro. Not gem carrier. That is the mistake. He can destroy any squishy brawler any sharpshooter thrower and  fighter(excluding shelly).. if they give more damage buff ,HP buff or reload speed buff to him they would need to decrease his mobility... to balance him 
---
They all look adorable! Also short-haired Bo. You got my respect sir!

I've seen people suggest a good way to counter this is to team with them, then instantly stab them in the back.

Let them initiate the teaming however. They need to learn from their mistakes.

Thats really cool!

Who says emotes fucked up clash royale?
---
That's what you get for pushing past 400 trophies with a lvl4 brawler. You were lucky that there wasn't more maxed players.
---
Minecraft more like ur mom thank you thank you have a nice day 
---
But I get it its annoying. üòë
---
This is so true
---
WHAT a perfect circle
---
True, making things shorter: he needs a buff on something.
---
I predict people with stupid argues saying "the team has bigger things to focus on"
---
I mean, yeah. But there will always be something bigger to focus on, even though, it's not a reason to stop giving us details and little things, that, even if it's little, can give us a big enjoyment of the game.
---
Not to mention that, it's a idea, a concept. 
---
It's not like saying "hEy, tHe dEvS NEED tO Do that" 
---
Underrated lmaoooo
---
First comment!
---
That‚Äôs literally what the guy asked not to do
---
This model looks amazing! Supercell you should learn sth from this hell of an artist :P
---
People probably won't post it here bc it's too early and people will forget
---
Nice idea to get comments thoughüëç
---
Yes I feel like every brawler should be useable in any gamemode. However this is a very dificulty thing to do with brawlers. As his attack is a dash an especial feauture that make him have more mobility and more dodge to balance him in 3x3 modes they need to be very careful about his HP and Dmg if he is a little high and  he will be broken little dmg buff and HP buff make a lot of diference. I sense this is a test for him if he is still bad probably they will change something about him. However most people are enjoying playing him in gem grab and bounty the way he is now
---
Yes a party up feature! Definitely on board.
---
Are you saying a plant is the same as a rock?
---
I don't want my money back. I ordered the gems and I want them. I haven't been refunded according to my credit card account but Google is saying the order was cancelled.
---
Jessie surely helps spike in his best and worst times. Rn as he walks the carpet, Jessie is walk-in him to the altar. She feels really happy for him and his balloon
---
They removed it cause its fucking boring. I know it stops teaming but you cant play it stealth o in an intelligence way. You have to play brawler who keeps shooting like dynamike or shelly or bull and nothing else
---
Dynamike Gang is supreme like that
---
It's the same picture
---
Supercell:
---
they could add a new character, like a mummy
---
Probably spammed Robo Rumble and other events since it gives lots of boxes while you can only get big boxes normally 
---
flair does not check out 
---
Already front page!
---
Diet Pam 
---
not a glitch. Older players have most of the brawlers so they collect their boxes and open them after the new brawler comes in order to get him. I have 20 brawlers so collecting like 150 boxes and opening them after the new brawler is released is smarter than opening them one by one before the release of Gene.
---
lol so close to mine, i got tara and then 2 days later i got mortis lamo
---
29, my record was 24, I think I Have the picture in my profile
---
I want to give people who dont know what /s means a heart attack. Hes not dead. No one in mha dies sadly. 
---
piper sucks so much so basically u only got 1 brawler )-: i dont feel that pain just yet but i feel it )-: if i had tara id b happy. i have all the greens, blues, &amp; they gave me my first epic, piper. what a waste.
---
Nice!
---
Uh, isn't your post. Original: https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/7dinjp/el_primo_skin_zombie_wrestler/?utm_source=reddit-android
---
Lex confirmed that even though he looks like a super rare he is still a mythic.
---
Dude you forgot nighteye üò≠
---
Underrated post
---
I have 15 regular and 1 big yeet
---
This is offensive because i team.
---
Yeah, I always find it so hard to take down a crow due to its high speed, range and plus its poison that keeps you from healing. Crow is balanced smh.
---
We discussed this. Its not. Possibly mythic (its located after tara and mortis). And the blue color is a bit more darker than the super rares ones. 
---
Kid, stop. This was already posted a lot and it is bullshit, he is a mythic
---
I'll love a contest for brawler backgrounds
---
o thx
---
Please contact in-game support. 
---
For everybody
---
Okay , this is epic
---
Its still 0.0096. in this game its the limit
---
He was also pretty unpleasant. I odnt like it when he talked down to me, he could have just said "the cactus is a spike" and I wouldve apologized
---
So el primo is what??
---
Das good shit. 
---
Nope. They need to get money somehow and skins definitely help it.
---
This game is less P2W than some other Supercell Games. 
---
Probably, if they did that, they would probably add a very P2W mechanic that will replace skins. And probably, it wouldn't be worth this replace...
---
Don't get me wrong, I would love if that happen, because I don't have many skins, only 3.
---
But, I know that we can't get everything for free...
---
Thx mate!
---
Maps need to be more unique, try something crazy, move the gem mine move the player spawns, do something new, because this map looks cool, but it‚Äôs the same play-style and all the gem grab maps 
---
Happens. Be glad you won the second time.

I'm pretty sure plants aren't even in brawl stars. Stop just disagreeing with me for the sake of it you know what I mean

Well I don‚Äôt know what to think, opened like 3 mega boxes, obviously I assume thats very lucky, just curious on the rates

When your saving the token doubler deal for as long as possible to help get Gene but 5 minutes before...
---
*mAiNtEnAnCe*
---
Are you high
---
It looks great! I‚Äôm hoping his attack and super get a rework as well because his attack is strange that it‚Äôs different left or right and his super being bombs is odd for someone who uses a bow.
---
Boi I‚Äôve carried 29(the max)
---
Looks good. One of the best ones so far.
---
Well here's a tip

Uhhhhhh

USE BULL IN EVERY SHOWDOWN AND FET EVERY TROPHY POSSIBLE üòÉüåÆüçñüî•üòÉüòÉüòÉüëåüòèüçâüòèüçâ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
r/lootstars
---
I have a feeling that if they buff crow he will become OP and then he‚Äôll get nerfed too hard and never be viable 
---
Exactly the same brawlers as I had untill I got Piper today. How many trophies are u at? 
---
Not even the right shade of blue lol
---
Oh man. Good one. üòÇ
---
bull is thicc he should be higher
---
Crow does need a buff, you were legit tickling the frank at the beginning l, and then just snowballed cus you had power points. But crow without and power cubes is too weak, and needs a damage buff for his hits. 
---
Really empty. And more cover, bushes and boxes
---
Dude just go play duo showdown if you know you‚Äôre going to team some of us actually try to play the game without being a trash bag even above 400
---
*C A C T U S*
---
I GOT GENE
---
I love the concept Good job!
---
Stop
---
That's just a theory.. \*\*A GAME THEORY\*\*
---
Teaming is legit . ‚ÄúYou are  ‚Äú just too stupid to team up with the other 8 people playing 
---
Same range as ricochet, I agree. Even just put it from 9.6 to 9
---
Meaning that chances are you don‚Äôt play the game just once but multiple times.
---
*Hello, police... Yes, I found him.* üòÇ

Really Great Idea

Now that's loyalty right there!

I liked life leach the most out of all the modifier because it encourages aggressive play (which I personally greatly enjoy) and discourages bush camping. (It also made teaming less practical)

Well, its possible, but since mythic just has three brawlers my guess he's going to be the third. And mythics have this magic/fantansy related thing.

The colors is just a troll, maybe.

When he grabs them it should be ‚Äúit‚Äôs rewind time.‚Äù

‚ÄúAh that‚Äôs hot‚Äù should be taking out a brawler.

Well everyone enjoyed except you. Try to do better, you haven't post any memes in months, produce is harder that criticize

I mean id love backstories, but you can just go to the brawlstars fan wiki to see the true backstory the BS deva gave the brawlers before removing it later for pointless info about their attacks

Sometimes I really itch to say "good game!" or "that was close!"

I care

Yes please!

Why didnt you just saved it till tomorrow to have higher chance of getting a new brawler bc gene is out
---
I only got to play it once, and it was the best showdown match ever

A little bit corny but I'm a sucker for corny stuff :D

true . but el primo with 10 gems and use his super on enemies  is the worst thing to do!

I can't see in your comment 'why?' what you know and don't know.

Cuz the mythic chance is also damn low. And it would also make more sense if just every rarity has this kind of system. It would improve Brawler draws overall.

Leon's more annoying than difficult to deal with,
---
Except for the fact that he didnt act rude... He was just making a joke... Fbi open up is a hella popular meme, so its pretty clear it's a joke, and therefore isn't bullying as the other dude said or really being rude, as it's not related to it being bad in anyway it's just a joke unrelated to the art or the artist in any real way. Also I fail to see your logic, many people can be rude to things they like, especially when in a joking manner. 
---
did the same thing as well! it‚Äôs really worth imo
---
Where is the humor
---
This meme was here at least once yesterday
---
What post did supercell yesterday? 
---
Valid concern! I mulled over the decision for a Native American inspired design for many of those reasons.  Actually had a similar conversation earlier, and a lot of what I said explains a little more deeply my thought process concerning this issue:

Okay! Thx for you‚Äôre respond:)

Jessie is underaged 
---
Sorry for wasting your valuable time??
---
is that a good or a bad thing? 
---
you will get the high raritys someday too, dont worry :)
---
Butiful
---
Except that it isnt? I really don't see how that is bullying in any way shape or form. It is definitely not the true definition in repeated annoyances. Nor is it in the way op meant it of being mean, he made a god damn joke, and not a derogatory one either, he used a popular meme unrelated to the quality of the art, or op in any way. 
---
It‚Äôs so good but why not just bull bull
---
Yeah same. Shame I didn't get any new brawlers from the two Mega Boxes though. Nice to have those extra gems now too
---
Everything is perfectly balanced. You have enough time to destroy the safe while somebody is respawning. If you're dying all together and don't get to respawn and push, that's is only your fault.
---
The images was at the game's files, i didn't made anything but compile It.
---
gold, you can get 2k gold in a week or wait for 169 gems in a year
---
I can kill a tank with poco, it's not a big deal
---
we can maybe buy gene tomorrow if **we** can, dunno how much will he cost 
---
Didnt think of that. That'll be cool if I can
---
So is the malicious socialist.
---
At the moment I meant showdown. The picture with the safe serves only as an example.
---
cuuuute
---
I have 2 big boxes and 42 small boxes (I bought the discounted double multiplier for 30 or so gems). I would have had 3 big boxes but accidentally opened one and got Frank, so I'm not complaining :)
---
would you like to answer their question?

*Mortis Gang*

Similar thing with my account, any club I join, I‚Äôll get questioned and called out because apparently I‚Äôm ‚Äúp2w‚Äù and it affects them somehow. Just toxic in general

You are basically asking me wether i want to lose trophies or gain trophies by doing what the majority of the whole brawl stars community is doing, i dont know wether you understand the obvious answer and i doubt you have never teamed before smh  
---
Why should i play duo sd, if you are not first in it you barely get any trophies, 2nd = 3 trophies and its time consuming.
---
same here
---
ThanksÔºÅMaybe I can make a Frank and his hammer hah.
---
You are the unsung hero of our time.
---
Sorry about taking it seriously, I just have a bad sense of humor I guess. But yeah you‚Äôre right, I should stop taking lots of things seriously. I just felt like it could‚Äôve made the artist feel unhappy about it. That‚Äôs how I feel anyway.
---
2k trophies? Pls don‚Äôt complain, a lot of peeped out there with almost 10k trophies missing brawlers to 
---
As a 500+ trophy Bo player, my biggest tip is this: Try to get his star power as quickly as possible. Even with the recent nerf, it still increases his team utility by quite a lot. Also, he's quite devastating on maps with a lot of walls and corridors, Cavern Churn, Undermine or Temple Ruins, even without his star power. I would not recommend playing him on Brawl Ball or Heist, except with the right team. Bo's range and damage output make him a good counter for many brawlers, but especially tanks, if you can keep your distance. I hope this helped! Just ask me anything else.
---
*Frank*ly, I think you puns are horrible
---
he is a support, by his own he is weak. low damage output, long reload time, moderate movement speed.
---
he is like poco, weak on his own, usefull to a team around him
---
I ship Bull and Bush

don‚Äôt

How to check for my drop rates

every box could be a legendary, and every box could be powerpoints, you never know. this is why gambling is not good

Why does this sound like me?
---
Haha only six upgradeable? Try 12.
---
Yes, I would like to see another loading screen.

Then give credit 
---
Without account for the percentage increase, you would need to open 3836 boxes for a 99% chance of a legendary
---
My favorite ship is Bull x Bush
---
Lel Long Range Brawler Are acually Gud on Heist Unless your teamate dont know how to shoot properly
---
Yah ik, there are many other ways to fix this

Yup, I feel this, sometimes I have time for maybe 1 or 2 games and I always feel bad for rejecting invites
---
Why is Leon in every one?

Yoooo they really need to hire some new developers, by far the coolest bo

that\`s how the mafia works
---
You have a 16.26% chance of receiving a mythic from 71 boxes

its a supercell game. there are over millions of players.

---
btiful
---
I can see where your coming from honestly, though I personally didn't think it did harm, I can see your opinion being different. Btw I don't really think it's your sense of humor at all, I think it was probably more of just not knowing the meme, I also wouldn't stop taking things seriously, I would just kinda let them meme, some people may like the meme and understand it's just a joke (including the op very easily), though there also is the other side where the op might get offended, so I can see your side too. Maybe I'm just an asshole honestly.

All healing abilities were nerfed in Life Leech. This includes Poco and Pam's and quite likely Nita's as well.
---
What about those 2 power cubes about 7 tiles away? Shouldnt they be the centre of attention to help damage the other brawler?
---
your\*

---
Balance Crow
---
this is not only this map, this is showdown.
---
especially on DUO-SD there are sometimes spwans where you cant get any box, and other duos have over 3. GG
---
! mega box, 12 bix boxes and 150 normal boxes. Fingers crossed man!!!!
---
Beat me to it
---
Holy moly, well I guess my credit card can take a hit...Who needs to find love, get married and have children anyways....
---
He fucks birds
---
He has a brother, called "Mustard"
---
Yea not balanced. There should be ATLEAST ONE per spawn. There basically is no skill involved then. Who ever gets 3-4 boxes at the starts going to win 9 times out of 10
---
Watching this makes me feel angry,Fuck randoms.
---
These look so cool, I wonder if they will add them back into the game...
---
I wouldnt mind getting a Happy Meal if it comes with a brawler collectable.
---
Gene is boy 
---
This actually pissed me off 
---
Not really, they are programmed to focus on high concentration areas, and teamers dont usually walk side bys side and can EASILY dodge them, and it still ONLY gives 2k damage, on the other hand, if youre fighting someone, there is 50% chance it will target you, and you dont always have a chance or path to run
---
why tho
---
It was not a bug...
---
Why not report the crow then too? 
---
Side note: can crow poison the safe?
---
People really don‚Äôt understand how to use Leon huh? They use the super to just run right at you which is obvious and attack from 2-3 tiles away instead of going right up to you. Good plays anyways, nice work!
---
Also, u can just have a shield for like 15 seconds and that would fix it
---
Your chances increase by 0.000048 for every 40 boxes you open, so in reality it should be much less than 3.8k. I don‚Äôt know enough match to account for the increase.
---
You have a 40% chance of unlocking him! Wow!
---
I only have a 25% chance. I need all the luck!
---
hs is fine and he is not weak, dont play him like he is a bull 
---
I had three big boxes and 18 small boxes but I accidentally opened a big box. I wish there was a box cancel button
---
great idea reminds me of payload from tf2 and great use for the tnt block

A fellow Mortis player, nice to see another amongst the bush rangers and stealthy Leons

I already miss the lunar backround

3 mega, 27 Big and 131 regular
---
I'd take it, gene isn't too goor
---
WE HAVE A BREACH I REPEAT WE HAVE A BREACH
---
No legendary chance effects mythic and mythic effects legendary epic and super rare do same shirt and rare stays same 24/7
---
0 mega boxes 0 big boxes 1 brawl box in def unlocking him
---
Mortis gang must stick together to defeat the infinite sea of teaming dynamikes
---
Love my tokoyami üñ§
---
I agree with you, pretty sure he's the character I got most of my solo SD wins, he is insanely good when played correctly
---
Yeah, it could be that. The FBI joke is overly used whenever I see something about any female character in Brawl stars. I hate to see that joke over and over again whenever I‚Äôm just trying to enjoy art and read nice comments. I don‚Äôt want to post my artworks because I feel like someone is going to say the same joke. I personally got tired of the meme.

This happens to prevent AFK players from getting rewards. However, it doesn't work too well, and if your game crashes (Which my *brand new* phone ***still*** does), then it doesn't let you gain anything. Personally, if my 2 day old phone is crashing, I think the game needs crash fixes.
