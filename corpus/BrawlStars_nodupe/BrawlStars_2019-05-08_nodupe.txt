Usually if any person in the match is above 500, they will be featured on brawl TV. I've been on brawl TV many times actually...

I think that the current artist has a contract with supercell, and as soon as it expires they will switch

That’s the way it should be

They’re probably in the negatives at this point.

Now meteors do something

this is really useful for blind people cause those are the only ones who will be able to take advantage of it

Yeah but I’m sure it’s still useful

Thanks man, I wish you like in getting the full set of legendary brawlers.

Can we understand though that to do this, Supercell would have to 3D model and fit the skins to the characters in-game? I get they’re all awesome. It’s not just popping the skins in game though..
---
This is the white crow rework we need though. White crow is just so bad. Great job on the model!

I was playing Rosa today, and her range is absolutely insane, she needs a nerf

You made a quitting post and then @ me. Hmmm

ahem mira mi username hablo español lmao
---
I'm extremely grateful for having both Crow and Spike, although being able to use Leon in solos and duos would be nice. I've always thought his super seems kinda op (especially at lower trophies). I think we could all use a little Leon in our lives. Pls give Supercell?

I spent 80 gems on White Crow. No thanks.

She probably stomps the ground with her paw when attacking. Plus it looks cuter

Everyday I hope,my luck will turn around and I will get a legendary.Everyday I am dissapointed,but congratulations sir.

This comment didn’t age well

(Guess who got a hefty nerf lol)

But... thats paradoxal...

I’ll downvote every single one of these.

It ain’t much, but it’s honest crowork.

Good job with the rhyme!

Remove Rosa!
---
IS PLAYING ROSA
---
No , coz I meant that the powercube is really far away  , u can say as the bull super charge
---
R u kidding me? How smart r u m8? Cavern Churn was my favourite map.
---
500?! that’s like $30... damn, i’ve been loving this game. I have spent $15. I have every brawler who isn’t mythic or legendary. But that’s sort of depressing. Might buy a mythic if given the change tho, that’s only like $5.
---
What’s the percentage of getting 2 legendaries in a row?
---
Difícil ver posts de brs aqui. Jessie é minha favorita btw, ela é fofa demais *-*
---
You will have no damage
---
Starting off strong with your first tier list, I like it!
---
You’re right, I’ll fix that.
---
how is what... !?!?
---
And Tara and Gene’s reload speed needs to be buffed, I feel like I can’t use them at all because of how ridiculously slow it is to fire
---
It means sweating
---
Its all over the field
---
Do you think god lives in heaven because he lives in fear of what he's created?
---
this shelly is stupid as hell
---
Cavern churn sucks
---
Ahha! And its me, the guy who supports that guy.
---
Saw that too
---
maybe remove his n word pass? Would make the whole thing way more authentic
---
At least you unlocked a legendary for free 😭😭😭😭 Omg I hated those stupid legendary elixir box pulls
---
How dare u not put Nita in the top tier u finna die ^^^/s
---
I don’t think you understand my conditions friend 😂😂😂😂

But dyna has 2 great skins
---
Yes kill the teamers

oh frick i forgot about the christmas one

This needs more jpeg

NINE NINE!!
---
Hmmm
---
Well I acctually noticed, that when you are a player under 3k, you get a legendary to keep you stick to the game. My bro startet playing, and within a week he got crow and mortis from free boxes. So I dont think it has to do something with Luck in this trophy ranges.
---
supercell is bitches
---
snake is that you
---
snnnAAAAKKKEEEE
---
Haha i dropped like 100€ in brawl stars, I just bought myself spike because I don’t get anything
---
More like when ur on Brawl Tv
---
Why would Nita add too many walls?
---
The throwers fan throws over the walls, Penny’s special can attack over the walls, Rico’s shot bounce further against each wall, but Nita? How does Nita benefit from more walls? 
---
Her bear is easy to deal with and it can’t attack from a range. The bear doesn’t benefit from the walls, I don’t get it
---
Why are you naming a dead snake?
---
Meteors are the most annoying
---
Why everyone thinks Piper is a princess? She has a gun in umbrella,which is a weapon used by spies.She's clearly a spy
---
Lol I bought crow and Leon. I’ve dropped about $150ish on this game.
---
Wall peaking.
---
Git gud and practice it.
---
You aren't getting a new brawler so you're luck dosen't change
---
D: omg
---
😏
---
it good but people these days only up redicoulsly bad drawing or really really good art take my upvote
---
Because barrel
---
Iam played 9month but my friend play only one month he got pam, piper, leon, crow but me only one Frank and another friend having tara, motis and another friend having gene, tara, pam, leon, crow, spike but iam mor cups and playing more but I not got anything that means iam very very very unless and unlucky 😔😔😔😩😩😩😫😫😫😖😖😖😣😣😭😭😭😭😱😱😱😱😢😢😓😓😓👿👿👿🙄🙄🙄🙁☹😣😖😫😩😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😓😓😓😓😓

That was so close at the end, really looked like you would die by the gas there.

and lost with rosa
---
Yet here you are? Giving BS?
---
The second and third one is just because your WiFi is bad or it’s loading, but idk about the first one
---
had my first encounter with this yesterday. we were up 1-0 and it was a great match until the end, and some clown on my team that had the ball and was near our own goal just spinning around.. tossed it into our goal as time expired... then he just spun around in OT and we lost.
---
IccI because he has 2 guns
---
Mortis got the flu xD
---
btw these arts were made by u/-mintberry- and u/Mini-Mango6
---
how do you look at a laugh
---
cauze you play well
---
Also like aqua gene
---
Yea like I’ll play siege or heist and there would be a brawler just sitting back spinning or just afk it gets really annoying
---
Yeah, I'm playing random duo and get a 3k player using bull which is at 200. He literally just relentlessly went in and die, never heals. I'm at 12k and this is the random I get. Undoubtedly I get 5th place that game.
---
Wut?
---
How the fuck is he hard to use
---
Sorry I forgot it. But it’s just a basic concept
---
Hopefully Brawl talk
---
Where's the original one?
---
Fix the game. No shop - no money - no fun - no friends to play with. Don't say when people switch to other non Supercell games that you didn't know. Its obvious and people are reporting it every day.
---
Idk it's very old
---
Finaly haven't ricochet
---
Rosa never scored twice?
---
That’s the problem. There are way too many maps in the game now and it takes forever to rotate between them.
---
Forgot to add it sorry
---
Edit:Rosa in the A group
---
her range is the only thing that makes her viable against shelly or bull tho..
---
long range brawlers dont have to deal with it either.. 
---
she is like a more stable version of el primo lol
---
Like a cross between a pig with flu and a broken accordion
---
Ever heard of Bush check :P
---
This was my first star power. It was worth it. You can go behind your teammates and heal them while your attackers get damaged. If you learn how to use it its great. Just dont use attack just to heal. You have to attack so you can get your super. Game grab, bounty....  Often its a game changer.
---
especially on frank
---
Alright
---
insane hit rate by enemies team
---
Good work mate!
---
Although I don't support spending money in the shop because of this Rosa situation which was ruined almost all game-mods to play.
---
maps brock and piper make would be nothing.just a wide piece of land and a few bushes for piper to use her star power.
---
WE want life leech
---
To everyone saying that it's Sakura spike series or brawl talk - no.
---
Sakura series already ended :( and Ryan said that they're not recording the Brawl Talk vids early because they're not sure whats going to be in the update and whats not yet.
---
Shouldn't be in the game.  So hard to give a shit vs rosa
---
In now mortis is super ugly with out the hat
---
 Gene with gems pulls in rosa with super ready. Rosa kills and takes gem :D
---
There's a 1% chance of getting a star power for free in a brawl box once you get him to level 9.
---
r/ihadastroke
---
I know he looks ugly with out it
---
This is nice. See you in hot.
---
Right.. Poco is literaly the easiest brawler to use. He is even easyer to use them bull, Primo and Shelly. The only thing you need to do is paying atention in you teamates HP
---
&gt;Prob gonna get downvote saying this. 
---
Hmm
---
Stop, stop please.
---
/r/Nolegendarygang
---
They’re definitely not common and you did well getting it from your first box but they’re not rare enough for me to pay for them, got 5 level 10s so far and I think the longest I waited was about a week.
---
There are two types of diabetes; they're very different. This is really just making fun of the whole brawler levels thing
---
Even King lost his hat(Crown)

They once reuploaded a video so probably YouTube forgot about the deleted one. (Maybe?)

u tried ^^

WOW THAT EDITING IS SO FREAKING GOOD!!! Wich program?

I did that so u would stop stalking all my posts. But still, u keep stalking me

Then go to search and write brawl stars , then click on " Brawl stars - brawlers " .

i’m confused and i think i got wooshed

I think you have it the wrong way

Good Think but the quests are so hard

How you did the background?

This is awesome I want more!!!
---
Thanks , but I dont hate you
---
Yes, except that that video came out before global, and we've had 4 new brawlers and some tweaks to reload speeds here and there.
---
I'm 8,8k on my main. My second one (Nita smurf) is 500. I created this smurf only for Nita to get her as high as possible (I wanted to see how high I can get). And I got Crow at 500 trophies without having any epic or mythics missing 2 blue brawlers and missing 1 green brawler.

every single kids game sub

Happy cake day!!!

---
Yes sir you are right
---
this tierlist was based off opinions so stop complaining that this tierlist is bad it was made for joking around
---
Win a battle 3 times using a legendary brawler. Oh wait...
---
You are right sir
---
Sorry. It's a word we use in SA. What I mean is they have either the lv 10 glow yet are not level 10 or constantly have their super activated. Brawlstars asked me to post it to YouTube and then send it to them. It's my first go at Reddit so I am a bit slow on the app and in English.

Wow accurate except for 3 brawlers.

Spike is around solid a tier.

Shelly is garbage.

Pam is at the top of a tier.

Oh no, you have a Dynabetes too? Which stage? Mine is II

Star powers didn't exist back then lol. Star powers came out about 6 months after beta launch.

Also Piper was pretty strong too, her range was longer by one or two tiles, and her damage was slightly higher

Lmao xxd

Awesome. Really cute.
---
Yes, not the greatest for sure. One I was really surprised with was el primos sp. Postponed it for others to get, but when I got it it did made difference in game play more then i was expected.
---
spike is easily a tier
---
El Primo be like "Aaaahhhh go crazy, aaaaahhhh go stupid.... go crazy, aaahhahahh....."
---
well playing hide and seek in snake prairie
---
#NICE PIECE OF WORK
---
I can relate to this. Good one.
---
Lmao
---
It's an unpopular opinion, but sometimes the truth hurts. Y'know?
---
Ah lol, that makes sense... i guess i still don’t know a lot about this game
---
rico and penny whould be lower spike should be I think a tier move shelly directly to f or d tier.
---
Beta players looking at deal to gem Legendary : Guess I don't have a choice?
---
id say shelly is a solid a or b since she has the biggest chance agains Rosa
---
And spike would be A tier if your a god with him and always hit 3 spikes but thats basically impossible (ill move him up 1 tier)
---
and pams healing is rlly good but becouse of her low dps at range she cant rlly heal with star power and is unable to do mutch dmg. In robo rumble/bossfight she is a solid s tier.
---
thnx for the feedback.
---
why is spike on all of this tier list so low her is easily a tier
---
I accidentally queued gem grab after playing bounty with piper. She worked a lot better than I thought she would and we won super easy.

That would be very useful.

It dosnt matter thats not my point all i'm saying is that trophies dont matter u wont have more brawlers because u have 10k trophies its just pure luck

what do u think this crow iq is

I think he needs just a little buff •~•

Contact supercell suplort i cant help you sorry:(

Ideal for the French players then

Attack: electric peashooter
---
Super: clash royale tesla but low damage and stun
---
Star power: attack is now pierce and when pierce a wall obstacles, the energy ball gains more speed and loss damage
---
for sure. i've been noticing that SUP ERC ELL is keeping the beginning/low rarity brawlers insanely op and nerfing the high rarities and not giving them a buff that they deserve. so that new players don't quit the game. this is not fair SUP ERC ELL :( please do something
---
I think war of club will be great too
---
Ungrateful. For some we’ve never had this much content before in such a short span. It was usually half a year for brawler releases and now they’ve been released by the month. They also have other stuff to do.

Thanks!

delet this

This is why being friendly is bad. Unless of course you don't mind being backstabbed.
---
Why not both?
---
I feel like the attack would be like the ranged attack of the master sword in BOTW
---
"Nah she's fine" supercell no
---
I guess that’s true
---
not bad... :/

The number of your counting shall be five, and five shall be the number of your counting.

If you add two entrances it would be more fair for the hunters

Luckily it ain’t my account

I dont think it was even released back then.

Ok :)
---
Invincible Rosa with her super... What a nightmare
---

---
I guess we don't need a Rosa box any longer.  She's fair-er now.
---
Love it!

Bull drives a motorcycle change my mind
---
No i've been playing solos and duos
---
Change it star power.like,Darryl is supposed to be unique.
---
Shelly's facial expression is just Derp lol!
---
AWESOME SKIN
---
Piper is so lovely with long hair 😍
---
To synergise with my team wouldn't I need some way to communicate with them?  If you know of some kind of way to do this in-game I'm all ears.
---
And if I want a balance in tanks on both teams you're saying I would have to ALWAYS play tank myself?  Does that sounds right to you?
---
Yes he attacks twice, and if your concerned about there being 4 mythics, i release brawler concepts in sets, this being set 3. I have 17 other concepts before this one, three per rarity.
---
Ah shit I meant Rico not thicco damn my phone
---
Ha ha
---
If you’re pushing on showdowns, you know you need to team or die at this point. It sucks.  But the only way to change it is make life leach the only modifier and put it on every map. 
---
Matchmaking is by far their biggest issue. I have sent them so many messages to the point that they don’t even reply anymore. I have 12,604 trophies at this second. I have plenty of people in my club who I trust and play well with. The problem is they don’t have max brawlers and we get matched almost exclusively against pros with max brawlers. Very hard to win when skill is almost equal but one team is all power 10s. So I almost exclusively play with randos. Some games, I get paired with players around my trophy range and matchup with the same. That’s rare though. Most games, I’m paired with at least one player less than 4k total but they’ve pushed one brawler to rank 20(all of mine are rank 20). This is where matchmaking needs to be fixed. Brawler trophies should not matter at all. Total trophies is the only thing that should count. I should never be paired with someone below 10k total trophies. If a two person team enters 3v3 and one has 12k and the other has 2k, they find another 2k player and put them in the 10k plus lobby.  
---
To be fair, sometimes it works in my favor where I have the team of high trophy players and the other team has low trophy players. But those wins feel unsatisfying. I love when I look at a matchup and see 6 players over 10k. Win or lose. I know it was 6 good players, for the most part, and that one team outplayed or out lucked the other team(luck is a factor, obviously). I can live with losses when matchups are fair. But when I have a power 3 gene with 1.8k total trophies going against 3 members of tribe’s top club, that sucks.

A Reading from the Book of Armaments, Chapter 4, Verses 16 to 20: 
---
Then did he raise on high the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch, saying, "Bless this, O Lord, that with it thou mayst blow thine enemies to tiny bits, in thy mercy." And the people did rejoice and did feast upon the lambs and toads and tree-sloths and fruit-bats and orangutans and breakfast cereals ... Now did the Lord say, "First thou pullest the Holy Pin. Then thou must count to three. Three shall be the number of the counting and the number of the counting shall be three. Four shalt thou not count, neither shalt thou count two, excepting that thou then proceedeth to three. Five is right out. Once the number three, being the number of the counting, be reached, then lobbest thou the Holy Hand Grenade in the direction of thine foe, who, being naughty in my sight, shall snuff it."

rico in spanish means rich, so it's Rich Rico
---
Just keep your distance...its easier to counter her with long range brawler, at least shelly isnt that op on her with the superstacks as she is on bull or primo...Altho I do think she maybe needs a small range nerf...
---
I would love this skin and it could be a 30 gem skin since we barely have any of those
---
Man cat Poco looks very cute man very cute and well drawn as well
---
Discord phone app. Facetime call.
---
Also dont you group up before you match up? You could just have someone from your team play a tank.
---
Don't be fucking stupid kid, it's not the same game. Because PUBG has voice chat, should brawl stars have it too? N o
---
So ver much like. It looks really good and helps Ayers get a reminder of what the super is. Happens all the time with me when I use Leon.
---
Every report must be checked before abdirect penalty. Don't afrec the matchmaking. That would make it acceptable.
---
You retarded?
---
This meme NOT made by overconfident Colt gang
---
I’m on with that I can agree
---
Poco needs a good buff on his reload speed and also his star power
---
SPOLIERRRR!!!!!!!!!
---
Rico the model for like THICCO
---
Mmmh Drag K Jessie Skin Ferb ?
---

Holy shit lol

His VO is a pun... because geology acc. to Google is the science that deals with the earth's physical structure and substance, it's history, and the processes that act on it.
---
Love this
---

You always have the best skin ideas
---
Niño, ni siquiera sabes usar Reddit, no creas que eres importante o que tu post va a cambiar algo. Ya madura y vete a YouTube, donde niños que hablan español como tú pueden decir idioteces
---
I like how you managed to incorporate the old **Chips** feature from the beta into the design!
---
*_You must be the chosen one_*
---
Sorry man... It's only a fan art not an animation..
---
This will just make every brawler overpowered.
---
I was abt to point out that it’s a nice throwback and reference to the first brawler system
---
Darryl
---
I agree with the first but if the second gets implemented she'll be useless.
---
I mean, you aren't wrong about Darryl being kind of weak, but there's one thing in your post that doesn't make sense.
---
Stop comparing Darril with Bull. It is stupid
---
Excuse me, her?
---
Men Poco?
---
I love this, maybe the sword could have a sheath, because Piper has a parasol, and when she shoots, her sheath disappears and u can see the sword
---
Dynamike but throws more faster bottles
---
Cierto que el no sabe como va reddit, pero por hablar español tampoco hace falta que lo trates asi
---
Have you ever met same players twice? Never happened to me.
---
When they say something under 11000
---
No it's noobmaster69
---
Hablo espaniol :v
---
I used to love these icons when they came out with the revamped brawler upgrade system, then they removed it :(
---
That looks like the google logo
---
Back in beta, i wanted to play with someone on my friends list, he said”i dont really want to”, so i played gem garb on my own.
---
He was on the enemy side that game lol.
---
Darryl has nothing unique to him, probably worst brawler.
---
LMAOO
---
It’s like the brawlers were created to be cats
---
1700 trophies, not a single legendary, you're super lucky.
---
Shut up
---
Looks like you beat me to it
---
How you make this things ?!?!?! Your like a god
---
-want ice with it?-
---
Nice concept:) u get my upvote
---
He was saying **to** repost, still dumb¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Or like me your mom/grandma calls you in the middle of a match
---
Bruh you cant just give piper a swprd and let her keep that face lmao
---
Yeah I don't get that wtf 💀
---
Sure why not
---
To leon who has super: dynamike, barley
---
Awesome!!!!
---
You forgot to quote the rest of that comment ;)
---
Sub to pewds
---
Perfectly balanced. As all things should be.
---
They are comments, not posts. Good job.

He could save others, but not himself.
---
Just noticed the humor tag
---
yeah totally
---
There is something wrong with the game because I have two devices both using the same network and there is frequently lag on only one device and not the other.  I can switch back and forth for matches and it’s always my iOS device.  My older android phone does not have this when I have a good connection.  To top it off I am using the IOS device as a hotspot for the android device, and turning off hotspot, Bluetooth and power cycle on iOS will not make the problem go away when it is happening.

---
What kind of excuse is that?! That does not justify taking other people’s effort, whether big or small, without their credit.
---
Stealing is stealing. There are no exceptions
---
Once you reach 500 trophies there is literally no reason to push beyond. You dont get special trophies, you don't get loot for having extra trophies on season reset. The only thing you get it -50% trophies on the brawler that are over 500
---
You mean FoRtNiTe
---
It might be good woth the Spile but hes a Cactuse and well,Desert.
---
Also Carl,how it talks,the cart and the pickaxe is too minecraftish.

Thank you. Very cool 😎
---
its an ad
---
Y la idea?
---
Congrats.
---
Your getting me onto a hulk skin
---
sometimes ya gotta move with them so they get caught in it
---
you’ll get used to it life is fair that way🤣😂
---
ok but what does the umbrella part look like
---
Acceleration causes bullets to go faster the further they go until other forces such as gravity and normal forces causes it to decelerate. Pipers bullets reaches its fastest speed (theoretically) at her furthest range which is why it does the most damage.
