Excuse me, I pushed him to 800 on solo showdown alone, he can even kill shelly if he has his star power

How do the healing Mushrooms work, they spawn on you only?

The title is supposed to be ‚ÄúBrawlers when they‚Äôre not brawling‚Äù or something like that. Bot says it not in English.

I have a neat tip for you: you probably get 20 upvotes because you complain in the title, next time just say "fan art!" or "I love sakura spike" or something modest

I guess it is just bad luck? For me, before Rosa's update, I got around 6 brawlers at lvl 9, and I opened boxes for 2 months and I didn't get any of them. Then I opened some boxes this week, and got 3 of them. It is just luck, hope you get some soon ):

It actually is. Considering our Piper was too fucking dumb to realise she was supposed to play range (and it was on the current gem grab map that has almost no long range lines of sight) and our frank kept feeding free ulti points to the shelly.
---
More trophy more bonus, that game is always the same

She gave him too many Cookies--&gt;HE THICC

Finally some food fucking memes.

what is the decrease rate for the brawlers after getting a certain one. I have not gotten a brawler in 4 months and I always get my daily tokens and finish the battles for the day and today I just got mortis. How much did my legendary drop rate decrease

Your post has been removed, make sure to use the body of a post to elaborate on the title.

i like yo mama jokes...yo mama is so fat, that she jumps for joy lol

make this 300 gems like crow, lowkey i would buy

While it's unique, it's basically a worse version of Island Invasion (a map that supercell already removed).

No. Why do so many people put islands in their maps? An El Primo could get stuck!
---
They probably could have kept it but reworked it slightly like safe zone and kaboom canyon, sucks.
---
What an idiot
---
Can confirm. Im also f2p and compared to Clash Royale which has a huge pay wall, maxing brawlers is easy. I maxed my penny to lvl 10 without spending money on the star power. Definitely focus on maxing one at a time. Dont try to max them all quickly.
---

No it isn't. You clearly can't read. I said that the daily rewards we have right now are randomised, while the ones proposed by OP aren't.

Nope. Shelly sucks.

Famcy fencing was probably my favorite

Let's hope your Allies didn't put in 15 tickets lol. I put in 20 once and got a Poco teammate.. if he had star power it's be amazing but he was level 5
---
You're right, I hadn't thought of that! Remedy immediately!
---
It looks really Cringey with all of those Capital Letters.
---
Not funny
---
It is hard when i have 21 heroes all at level 6-8. So because i unlocked alot of brawlers early im getting zero gold return for the rate theyre all levelling. F2p will take months and im playing at a high skill cap at a disadvantage with no star powers. Im spending alot and still no dice

I didnt compare it to another game my situation is different and its a huge pay wall. Ive opened over 150 loot boxes through the event and its not helping one bit because i have so many heroes
---
You are in the same exact boat I was.  Pick one or 2 (I did Nita and colt) to max out.  The started Shelly when done.

The gold sink is trying to max them all at once. Focus and it‚Äôs not too bad.

Yes that's true, but there's still no excuse for a Piper with awful game sense: Standing still, in direct line of fire, while missing every shot.

My name was ' I eat ass' so they banned me for 2 days.

I give a shit? If I don't know what I'm going to receive tomorrow, I won't be able to manage my expenses properly: what to buy, what brawlers to upgrade etc.

Just like yours doesn't lmao.

Wait, that's illegal.

they do, but not as often as higher trophies sometimes they can forget to

Rosa isn't as good anymore tho and afk is more than that lol
---
"There's a 50% chance where i flip a coin to get a head" If i flip the coin twice what is the percentage chance where i land a head on either one? 75%, easy. And thats not accurate?
---
I am using an estimation purely because none of the community, not me and not you, know the exact percent drop for each item to appear. It is randomised, and even the devs wont have an exact answer. I use an estimation close to what i believe is true. So please don't say such stupid things.
---
Island Invasion had one of the highest teaming rate of all SD maps though. And I personally was not a fan of it.
---
That's so high, mines awful and I've got none

Nice..

But rico is a brawler and those AI bots are not

Don't eat ass then

Looks more like a boy.
---
Maths do not work like that?? When you estimate a chance like this, you have to multiply the first chance by the second chance (i.e 0.5 * 0.5, because 50% = 0.5).
---
By the way, you just proved me right by saying it's randomised. It was the very thing i was talking about from the start.
---
Even primo
---
Good question the best you can do is ignore him there is no actual way to ban someone so either SUPERCELL will see it or you will just have to ignore and move on

Is this work of a enemy stand?!??!?!

Tara is a low tier brawler rn.  Nita is very good in the meta.  Frank is only good in BB, and Piper is only good in bounty.  Since Piper and Frank are only good in one game mode, they‚Äôre overall pretty bad.
---
IkrüòÇ
---
But when you have mortis and piper?

The damage is there, but He is so easy to dodge

He has a good super but he‚Äôs only good in bb.  His attack is too easy to counter.

That's a nice Skin

I don‚Äôt think the pet thing will work if u think about it.

I got leon at 600 thropies  and spike at 3k

1 big no, 0/10.
---
I mean Mortis is pretty meh right now
---
U havent even got crow yet!get sakura
---
I got leon at 600
---
It includes the options: swap sides and kick. So if I decide to switch the opposing member to my team, he would need to leave on his own and come back which is an irritating inconvenience üò•
---
I don't think we need another rarity legendaries are hard enough to get
---
It happens some times
---
Not if you are good with him... Mortis may need a little damage buff, but he can already dash away from everyone if he wants to, by increasing his reload, it would be abnoxious.
---
Recomment
---
I jjst wanted to say that :P
---
Everything is fair except for the leon buff, and the Pam and mike nerfs. Leon is still strong. Mike is weaker than barley right now, and Pam just got nerfed
---
Bo...
---
Whut how are you sp
---
pls don't spoiler

Increase brawler drop rates, not going to happen. ‚ÄòCan I get more free stuff?‚Äô

Yea, just people who hate the game and are trying to make a dramatic reason why, which is usually not true

The best I‚Äôve seen today.
---
tbh that is probably your account and you don‚Äôt want to get banned lol
---
Lol yeah I‚Äôd say thats some pretty great luck
---
Dude if you lower reload speed that is a buff. Say a brawler has a 2 second reload speed, if you lower it by 1 second it is faster
---
My clan was 'we eat ass' so it was because you were being greedy.

Ofc not

Even if you are good with him, he is not a strong character in the top meta right now
---
mediocre, the middle is awesome, the sides are meh. 6/10
---
Regardless the player should be allowed to keep his name and clan, people that wallow in hate consume themselves eventually its best to leave them to their own devices
---
Yes it is. Shield is a stat as much as damage is in this case
---
Ooof
---
Yeah, but then you don‚Äôt have to buff Mortis, you have to nerf Rosa/Pam/Carl/Gene. Then Tara and Poco are a better option as well...
---
Well I got Leon like 3 months ago or something so I should be able to get 295 more gems in that time
---
the video man, ur playing an auto-aim(mostly) brawler and still bad
---
0/10
---
The best way is to keep all your gems and buy some good special packs. You ll get one for 439 gems sometimes. I have 25/25 and didn‚Äôt put so much money (~80‚Ç¨ in a year)
---
Just edited my comment at the same time as you posted this - have a read
---
it ain't much,  but it's honest work.
---
370
---
And someone in crow gang said it was his favorite map to push crow.
---
Yes indeed, multiplications first.
---
Don't forget we don't need jump pads as well.
---
But rates will be increased and coin power point rates will be droped to about 70%
---
It's the same thing and keep downvoting me as much as you can

Gene is the only of those characters that sees a reasonable amount of play on bounty. Also the post did mention a Carl nerf.

People said the same thing about crow and they still buffed him

Yeah, and Crow is a nightmare on Showdown, don‚Äôt let this happen to Mortis and Piper plz.

More free stuff, not gonna happen
---
i get ur point, although, in the earlier times when legendaries came out - they were hard to get, but they kept adding them because its obviously a card game, they have a lot of legendary cards now while we have 3 legendary brawlers, clash royale has changed over time but since it started to die and brawl stars took over, supercell started adding even more and more possibilities for people to get legendaries and good stuuf over all, tournaments, challenges, missions

only shelly tho

Cmon supercell why we dont have thih thing in bs?

Damn i got her meanwhile to 500

He still must retrieve his lost souls... I mean trophies.
---
Dude he's a healer with moderate range, deal 1000 damage per shot (about 3-5 shots to kill) and heals about 60-80% oh health that he gets after 6 hits. He can hit multiple targets at once making his super easy to get if you got good aim and supports his team if you play him right
---
Of you don‚Äôt have a thrower, the Cannon Will keep on shooting...

Pretty good actually, i think you'd get one in 3 months or less, msg me if you do

Rico is a part of a robo league a long time ago then he got kicked from the league same with barley then they joined the brawler league to fight off those robots
---
I suck too much to even get there with some max brawlers let alone level 1
---
Factually speaking, i admit it is randomised and it is my fault for phrasing it incorrectly. However, sometimes we get more power points like 7 maybe instead of just 4. Give or take, we come to an average. 
---
And if you have ever learnt math before, to calculate probability rates we take the probability of not getting it and raise it to the power of n tries. So what you've done is calculate the possibility of not getting a heads (25%).
---
Hey thanks for being the one person on the universe that gets to decide whAt people should and shouldn't get offenses about. We all appreciate your hard work and super high maturity level.

At least mans is some ass at the game

---
Probability of getting heads once = 50% = 0.5. Probability of getting heads twice in a row = 25% = 0.25. that's what i meant.
---
I like her ult. she seems like a strong team player
---
totally
---

---

In today's episode: anal assassin does shitty thing.
---
Somehow i found gasthejews funny i think im not normal
---
It‚Äôs funny cause you can even tell he didn‚Äôt mean to. He just did it because he was embarrassed üòÇ
---
wait till she gets her super
---
Yeah take that powercube 13 rosa
---
&gt;go out of your way to not respect something 
---
What? The condition of respecting something is the one out of my way.  It takes literally no energy to have no respect for something lol
---
&gt;disrespecting it just cuz seems like a waste of time.
---
Cool. Fortunately, my lack of respect for religious thought is not based on "just cuz"

*Customer* Can you pull out my floor? Then I need new carpet replaced. *Gene* AHuahBlalaa. *Customer* Ok? (Later)  *Customer* How will you pull out the floor by yourself without any tools? *Gene* AhauaHahaLaA. (Gene uses his magic hand and pulls out all the floor in the house, along with everything on it, including furniture.) *Customer* üò∂ (Gene uses magic hand to put everything back with carpet.) *Customer* Thank you. *Gene* HAhaLaafalua.

This is just a random side story. If you don‚Äôt like it I respect your decisions fully.
---
You mean rank 20
---
They don't exist anymore for a reason.
---
The past being more horrible doesn't justify being horrible today.
---
Why do you want to report him? Is he not allowed to have this opinion? Some would even say it is justified.
---
That's what I said in my mind haha
---
But poco needs a buff
---
I'm 99% sure this is stolen because I saw it yesterday without the credit, and the background is easy to edit
---
Lol
---
This. Is. So. Cute.
---
At school in my head i had the same idea xD
---
Omg how could you get your Brawler so high?
---
Maybe you should read up on what defamation is.
---
Freedom of speech, stop being a nazi
---
Yea it is hard to ask for because we don‚Äôt live in a utopian society where everything is perfect. It‚Äôs the internet. Get over it. If you can‚Äôt handle what someone puts on the internet than don‚Äôt use it. That simple.
---
Not going to claim you're wrong but do you have any source that shows precedent of such a lawsuit?
---
Creativ.
---
Dude I‚Äôm just like too cool for fortnite now. It‚Äôs a trend and I class myself as quite the hipster, I couldn‚Äôt be caught dead actually playing fortnite let alone LIKING IT!! Omg!!!
---
I‚Äôm in grade 9 now and honestly my girlfriend would dump me if she caught me playing fortnite! (She‚Äôs in grade 11 btw)
---
Yes that's a good idea.
---
Yes,he need a buff.He is to weak.
---
That neck tho
---
Lose trophys
---
If anyone sees anything else like this, the way to report is to go into settings-&gt; help and support-&gt; contact us. You can submit images like this or just describe the problem. 
---
I went ahead and reported them for you, this was their response:
---
&gt; Hey RoabertG.üòä
---
&gt;Thanks for writing in. It's Gina here at your service.
---
&gt;
---
&gt;Thank you very much for coming to report this to us.
---
&gt;We try to keep the game as clean as possible but it seems there are always some that find a way to sneak names like these.
---
&gt;If you ever come across to something like this again please don't hesitate to contact us again.
---
&gt;We will take care of it immediately!
---
&gt;Once again thank you for your support.
---
&gt;Warm Regards.‚ù§
---
So for all of you who are calling this person a ‚Äúsnowflake‚Äù, you should know that Super Cell is against this sort of behavior. Keep that in mind for the future.
---
Gameplay 10/10 we'll done looks 7/10
---
New mode: Bountyball
---
There are 2 stars, which two teams can pick up (red team can pick up blue team star and vice-versa). There is a ball.
---
For each goal, you get 10 stars which can greatly improve your score.
---
Yes we do üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Use mommy‚Äôs credit card
---
Already done
---
*When you realize Brock only shoots three rockets at a time yet his launcher has four.

Lmao üòÇ I‚Äôm dead
---
If a brawler is only viable in very specific situations, they're bad.
---
Exactly. The government can‚Äôt ban you from going around and shouting racial slurs. That‚Äôs completely fine as far as free speech goes, but when you decide to play the game they can decide that they want to impose rules. If you don‚Äôt like them then you are free to not play the game. It‚Äôs the same reason why they can make your remove curse words from your name. They want their game to be kid friendly, so if you don‚Äôt want to be kid friendly then don‚Äôt play the game.
---
A year is 365 days, and 5 years is 1825 days, but the picture says that the guy has been offline for 304 days, which is not even close to being considered a full year.
---
Where do you see your chances
---
Because you can't buy them from shop lol
---
He isn‚Äôt weak, he is outshined by Pam...
---
Wdym he's useful in many situations like supporting, Crowd control and keeping teammates up.
---
You see, it‚Äôs the hair
---
Some men just want to watch the world burn.
---
I guess it depends on who is playing I'm better with Poco then pam
---
Removed. Rule 3. No providing information on how to break Supercell Terms of Service.
---
I agree but leon is more pleasing to unlock
---
r/woooosh you're welcome
---
That's why you support teammates, He is SUPPORT not for complete assaults.
---
Sorry I'm not a fan of Marvel
---
In general, not just against the IKE
---
He‚Äôs useful at stopping enemies from getting the bolts, he‚Äôs great at defending the Robot, he‚Äôs great at breaking walls
---
He‚Äôs just overall way better than Piper and definitely not a terrible brawler
---
oka
---
Walls are your friend.
---
He's worse than el primo
---
I have been re-offered earlier offers that I did not buy, but it seems pretty random.
---
In bird culture, this is considered a smart move.
---
No he doesn‚Äôt. Specially not a reload buff.
---
With a grabbling hook?
---
So much ignorance, but so little time
---
Get some m√ºsli and chill, please
---
He got sex change surgery and he is now punching plants in the face.
---
Cuck
---
How? You do realise that this is possible
---
Crowd control? Really? Poco has basically zero CC, his shots are ez to hit, but they deal so little damage that enemies can ignore them (especially tankier brawlers like Pam, or someone else). Supporting and keeping teammates up is the same thing. His main problem is that Pam is infinitely better. Better damage, healing (esp with SP), health, and sustain.
---
Maybe colourise? :D
---
I think the ' is the "mistake"
---
Filter blue light and lower brightness, you're done.
---
Wait Ligma ...the fuk u just said to me u little sh*t?üòÇ
---
Spooky scary skeleton is
---
#SITTING IN THE BUSH
---
Yea me niether. Probably 12 year olds who have completly lost their braincells
---
Yes, but the other supports CAN do assaults
---
Are you in my club lol
---
It would be better if the video was 10:01 instead of 15:26
---
I feel her pain... üò•
---
BOOM! It's a Nita
---
This is me
---
Looks like great fun, and I think that supercell should add a map like this to the game!
---
Carl likes it.
---
Crow got an overbuff and Pam is just really tanky
---
Tf lol
---
It is on the 3 dots at the top right. Press change user flare and ta daa you got the flairs
---
I have more legendary brawler than mythic ones. feels sad man
---
r/substhatusedtobegoodbutthemodskilled
---
Hmm.... Probably yes
---
Upvoted for high effort
---
This is...wow..
---
The best idea update
---
wut
---

Very good. It drops .06 every time you get a legendary. You should get one any day now.
---
Nice
---

---
She needs a buff
---
Yea xD
---
Colts a bot bruh üòÇ
---
Well one‚Äôs a genie and the other‚Äôs a plant
---
Is there any hope of having actual season rewards?
---
Earning like 4 boxes every 2 weeks is ridiculous and gmis no incentive to pushing trophies
---
I am sorry to inform you that no one cares.
---
r/nice
---
How do you know who is male and who female
---
This needs to get record upvotes.
---
Fam i miss these good days of brawl stars

---
Playing Carl seems to work good for me
---
Something was done
---
No it isn't, I spent about an hour on this.
---
this might be the best skin idea i‚Äôve seen on here
---
Alright, sure. Let's say you did.
---
#Do you have one hand or something? How can it take that freaking long.. #
---
Good concept!
---
LOL
---
I'm sorry for bad internet, i really don't have enough money for better internet.
---
Mine was as well before I got Leon
---
If you are a ten year old, you should stick to taking notes on memes in this sub so that when you're old enough to have an account, you don't end up with negative karma
---
Mud balls and spreads in worms. Wait,no. Thats ew.
---
I know right. Better bring Mortis backs to his hey days
---
Plz make this a skin plz supercell
---
Yeah buff mortis hes really weak right now :v

It‚Äôs blue because it‚Äôs friendly. It will only be red if it‚Äôs the enemy teams.

Sorry if this sounded rude

Nah

i don't think America have 228th rule which is about drugs. Only Russia can understand
---
So youre comparing it to another game and because its not as bad in your eyes its okay? I never played CR but ive played plenty of money grabbers
---

Never seen a gold one...

Brock isn‚Äôt bald

Yes he is and look at global leaderboard
---
Right! Heist is the best!
---
....at least we still have a rosa too...
---
Tbh, I feel worse for my teammates when this happens ... they never get to witness my insane brawl skills
---
I found one scam on this reddit page.  Yeah you arent the only one.  The only people supporting it are the people posting about it, and they all have the name of "BrawlTV".  Super unconvincing.
---
Great design
---
Nop
---
I love you 3000
---
I love you both
---
A little strong?

A grave digger cult discussing their plans while top hat supreme leader talks with general, with another general looking out so they don't get caught (circa 1920, colorized)

I actually have the worst connection lol i can't play like at all it is so damn bad
---
Tbh Rubber Duck Jessie is better, and I regret buying the Knight skin
---
I saw this reposted twice now, do people not see the watermark?
---
Who would win: Franos or Helk Primo?
---
so sad no one sees this as the harry potter reference i hope it was meant to be
---
Rico gene and carl should be on the top
---
Am blue and do make robots as told by my name, can confirm. ^/s
---
#Angery Rico
---
Mine is .1006 and I need all the mythics, spike, and crow
---
I like this, but think it‚Äôd look better with the darker hair seen on bandito Shelly, personally.
---
Nah you pretend to not kill that kid hoodie
---
I got crow before Rico seems like luck I only recently got poco crow was my fourth
---
Darryl down the middle
---
‚ÄúHoney, you should see me in crown‚Äù -Moriarty-
---
I am in the  same situation
---
Gene special needs to take damage
---
but if you have youtube rewind 2018 on your team then you can't win
---
I beg everyone who is reading this comment and hasn't gone there yet. DO NOT GO THERE. I went there, I regret literally everything.
---
Recently I had Spike at 0.2544% and I completed the collection (25/25 brawlers)
---
Of course! Look at your gems.
