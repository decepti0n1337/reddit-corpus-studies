I played it many times and found out that 2:08 counts as a loss and 2:07 as a Win. You can trust me
---
---
---
EDIT: after reconsideration I decided to put Leon as Strong
---

---
Tick is not that good because of his shots are so slow but can offer some control
---
this is definitely a problem with the servers, one thing that fixed it for me tho was using samsung game launcher (if you have a samsung phone ofc)
---
yeah sorry
---
not got a brawler since april besides tick
---
Yep, outlaw colt is too plain for a low cost. The price could be 5k star points if reasonable
---
Thats copying other people's work which is not allowed
---
If you look far back in the bottom left corner you can see Leon
---
lol
---
mortis is the best
---
Ahh yes, i love the gender _magical creature_
---
griefers are in every game, a report button wont do much as it can be easily abused and its hard to determine why that person was afk in the first place

What app do you use I've never done this

The thing is: he did not even exit the game, like you do when someone calls, he wanted to make us lose
---
This was the advice I was looking for
---
thanks
---
Please check out our new subreddit r/brawlstarsnextlevel
---
I wouldn’t really know, I haven’t played that mode much... I never have any tickets
---
yeah, I know that, but its kind of hard to punish people based on not playing, I'm sure they would've added something if they knew how to get clear evidence of people not playing on purpose or trying to move but lagging, stuff like this
---
The matchmaking seems pretty good
---
EARS
---
Oh, its her second star power??
---
Right 😂

Im glad you like the idea,  please check out the new subreddit r/brawlstarsnextlevel,  join up,  we're new but getting better everyday

Lets bring this meme back ;)
---
A little late, but definitely deserves my upvote.
---
I HAVE EVERY BRAWLER EXCEPT THE LEGENDARIES
---
*REEEEEE*
---
F
---
no, theres an exploit where you can change star powers snd give them to other brawlers, thats bibi with mortis's "coiled snake" star power
---
00:19
---
Thx :D

Meh

brawlers can't fit through one block spaces

I do not feel safe talking to you mortis😂

Well Rico is thik
---
Not the much people in this sub reddit like teaming...
---
Repost
---
I do watch out for it constantly, but I think that by changing it to where a player would lose invulnerability whenever they fire would make it a bit more fair to the other team. Just a thought I’ve had for a while
---
r/shittybrawlstars
---
**ZA WARUDOO, TOKI WO TOMARE**
---
Getting one legendary is WAYYY harder than getting 3 mythics. You are very lucky
---
Well but the enemies are based on the highes player. Matchmaking gives almost no shit about every other player. If your brother is as good as ypu with 3 times more trophies ok then.
---
***Poco then calls in Shelly***
---
I need Leon
---
He's so hard to get fck
---
*pickle
---
I'm at 12500 and  have everyone maxed saved for star powers for about half the brawlers and all I'm missing is spike. Like jesus christ that little mescleline button of peyote does not want to be with me and it hurts. Next time hes offered to me im just gonna buy him. I have 12k gold so a single robobattlw I'll have him maxed out
---
Yes I’m aware. Just pointing out this major flaw that made the game basically a 3v2 because one of the player had such low total trophies
---
That idea sounds good and all, but you have to take into account matchmaking time. It's a lot easier just to pair players by only brawler trophy's than a mix between overall and brawler trophy's. The games already shitty servers would feel even more trash when you finally get into a game and the only people the game could find are across the country.
---
You have 17 brawlers to upgrade so coins are a huge help
---
I have 13k with 10 coins
---
He did the switch star power glitch and gave himself rocket number four
---
I honestly would rather wait in match making then play that match up
---
Are you russian
---
Once did this expect the frank had power grab.
---
A rat
---
[removed]
---
Hahahaha
---
I’d love to see this change made. There is certainly a need for invulnerability on respawn but being able to fire your weapon while invulnerable isn’t necessary. Firing should remove the buff.
---
The matchmaking system is already a mix between brawler trophies and total trophies so how would changing the impact of the both trophy kinds(?) matter?
---
It is better to say that than reposting....
---
My bad thanks for the info
---
24/27 missing león, gene, and bibi. Technically I'm luckier than you, but those are the three best brawlers overall right now so I don't consider myself luckier :(
---
It's not mixed already? The game doesn't take into overall trophy's past 3k. I could be wrong though.
---
What?
---
how did the one in the bottom survive for 7mins?
---
This post is an accident
---
They are either kids or losers. Purely evil.
---
oooh I like this one, I hope SU adds this
---
Supercell being bad, doesn't mean their game is bad
---
I’ve been waiting all day for one of these. Had a bunch of 9 Shelly games. Finally hit the jackpot.
---
I don’t
---
The playerbase isn’t going to be getting much bigger at this point? Global release was months ago, at this point people are going to start quitting and not start downloading the game lmao
---
Its Vexus Legends 
---
Edit: I'm sorry I will not be able to help because there's a tournament in my club:(
---
I wish I got that skin :( but I got shiba a way cuter skin :)
---
Omg such an original joke
---
Should I just turn off my internet?
---
If the mortis is bad and the mike good then absolutly
---
No, you wouldn't enter the game
---
AKA: P2W
---
actually tried crow on the top😂😂 but he's hard, his face was weird!!
---
You need a bad, but bad wifi connection
---
Couch Corey
---
Which network should I switch to?
---
Almost 13K here never pulled a legendary
---
A weak one
---
A fucking shelly did that to me i was mortis * once i died she ran from who killed me
---
69
---
haha, thanks buddy 😂 was real bored in the class!!
---
Ik 10 minus now
---
I'm at about 5k now too, and I only have 21/27... So don't feel too bad mate 😂
---
Will I be able to go back into my old wifi?
---
Spike
---
You mean raiden
---
Very nice!
---
Crow is only legendary that mortis could drop
---
Idk
---
Yeah
---
happy cake day!
---
Kinda reads like a copypasta.
---
What about toilet cory naw jk everyone ok
---
Not a good map, too many obstacles and water with not enough space to work with, also characters like crow, piper, bull, elprimo and Darryl can get stuck in the outer islands

**I DO NOT COME IN PEACE**
---
No one gets Leon as their first legendary
---
First of all you two legendies
---
2nd it's better than having all your brawlers at lvl9 and waiting for like 9999 star powers
---
Yes I love it
---
Fair enough, but it needs a nerf, like Gene's range when he was first released.
---
Not attacking Idea super unique but seems a bit like ticks regular attack but still unique small question how long is the time between throwing seeds and birds attacking( not a specific amount if you dont have one but approximately) I have a small suggestion as well imagine if the seeds can latch on to brawlers and then birds attack.
---
Crow did not need a buff at the first place
---
If you want to watch it was broadcasted by Ark (english) and Spiuk (spanish) 
---
There were actually more by country but unfortunately I don’t know them.
---
Not really. It just got released in China so many more new ones can be expected to join. While it may be true that some people start quitting, the player base is increasing imo. The rate of increase is getting slower is all
---
Honestly I have no idea. I unlocked bibi right after she came out, I unlocked mortis and Tara in consecutive boxes lmao, a month after bibi, I got all the epics within a week about 2 weeks before I got bibi, I got all the rares and super rares over the 3 months I started the game in. I thought I was just unlucky at first and it balanced out later giving me all these brawlers, I didn’t know how unnatural the entire thing was 😂 sorry if this is confusing
---
Well... They do add up to the same. And this happens when not enough people at your trophy range are joining a match to speed up the process after a while it then pulls the trophy ranges that are close to yours. (At least I believe that's how it works.)
---
alright ... i'll just turn off my internet for today
---
Thanks Buddy 😊
---
Perhapz
---
That's crazy
---
the art style is Night in the Woods, which is a really good game. i think the book you're thinking of is the don't let the pigeon drive the bus art style lol.
---
That barely having a good time
---
I found The book you are talking about
---
Shibas are the most memeable dogs. Change my mind.
---
I checked the random that I played with and he had 15k trophies so that might be the explanation  but at least I know I just competed against really good players and won
---
Ahhh yes yes
---
My bro got crow in his first mega box
---
I got spike from a free box
---
Solved the mystery
---
🙄
---
I opened 4 mega boxes and got nothing. The next day I opened 2 brawl boxes and got Pam and Tara
---
The one I have is called "The pigeon loves things that go" lol
---
Hofully supercell adds it
---
Star power is still good tbh
---
What Trophy level are you 1 minutes seems insane unless your at basically 700+ and even then just maybe. Also your brawlers might be under leveled play someone else, you can't get mad at Supercell because the one brawler you want to use is under leveled but you have other brawlers that are possibly(complete assumption) a good lvl for their trophies. I personally have every brawler 350+ (Ik bad but that was before trophy balance I play relatively little also casual so I'm slowly getting people higher but even then I only use lvl 6 brawlers mainly rarely my lvl 9s and 10s which I only have 5 of.
---
bruh
---
Actually never mind, I’ve found an artist.
---
Nice
---
Well then guess I'll never play my shelly again till she reaches lvl15 and wreak havoc later on.
---
what does the 24/27 mean
---
That wouldn’t get you banned
---
that's a cool idea actually (reminds me of Home Alone if you watched the movie) :D
---
and for stats I didn't really think about it much because I focused more on the drawing and the idea of the attack like any other OC posts I've made :D But I guess roughly like... hmmm about 0.5-1 second? Because I imagine the birds flying towards the spot where he threw the birdseed will take just a bit of time
---
He’s a pro player who has a YT channel tho

Play this on max volume.

---
Those are great tips,  only thing I'd add is when in 3v3's, do your best to cause area denial,  forcing the enemy to take a different route lest they be damaged...
---
If you do this right,  you can steer them into your teams line of fire.
---
I have no legendaries at 6k but I have all the mythics and I'm pretty happy with what I have
---
*laughs in trophy inflation*
---
Look, not trying to soil your work, but if that appeared in front of me in real life, I'd fuckin' cry and run.

Yeah it totally glitched. Definitely.

Gotcha

Where are the AirPods

same here, I feel bad for him if its true lol
---
No space helmet im dissapointed

I already gave it to 1k people (with 600 trophies), my friend opened crow at 850 :(
---
I've got 3:31
---
I get it
---
Stop with your low effort shitposts you trash.
---
I have every brawler, just hit 9k, the only thing I get from boxes is coins, star powers, or bonuses like tickets or gems, and when I get gems, it’s atleast eight, I haven’t spent anything, I just loose a lot.
---
So bovines, to you, are carnivores?
---
I belong with the dynamikes
---
I got everything but Spike at 10k..
---
Thank you for Understanding
---
no need to get so offended lol, just downvote, maybe report for low effort post and move on
---
I think me too
---
As much as this map would be good for piper, it would be heavily unbalanced, so pls no
---
Nice. I vaguely recall playing with you. We should play sometime.
---
Idk if its true but I heard that Poco's attack isnt one "musical note" but its instead divided in 4 smaller attacks like shelly's shotgun, I have no idea how that would work tho
---
?

very accurate

---
Hoooog ridddaaaaaa, oh wait it's the ugly Carl skin, nvmd
---
Mortis is using his super button but bar is showing his normal attack bar
---
He has most of his account stacked. Sorry I can't use more than one image, but just look at it. He has everything at power 10 almost, one nine, Rosa at rank 2 power 6, and Carl.
---
OP should've made a joke about that
---
I have been trying to get it for ages.
---
Im now at 10,000 trophies and i opened all boxes i have saved i had 500 boxes and no Legendary or Even a star power

14 up to this point and thanks

Wow u guys are pros I'm still figuring out how to get my first trophy

XD

On ig 35, and here 14 very nice

Sry to hear that

It's a consequence of a terrible map design.

Cool!

Thank you, you proved to me that you have no more arguments to fight.

Poco attacks in orbs so if a character is fast enough he gets hit by poco twice but if you get hit by multiple orbs at the same time then it won’t count

You’re right. Because this isn’t an argument. I’m right. You two morons are wrong. I just wanna be friends now. 😘

it could be Op if u consider the new crow starpower is coming

Why did you shake it?

Lol at 8.2k missing Crow and Leon rip to everyone else

whats the prblem? find a team of 3 mortis and they will run in brawl ball
---
Me and the boys temporarily teaming up to beat other teamers.
---
it would destroy bones
---
In a 2 v 1 scenario, nope, you are wrong, no one is supporting you, and we have the two of us against you, back down and stay down, you are wrong from the beginning, you arguments are invalid. You act so immature, rude and unintelligent. Your entire personality is instigating and yet you act in such a manner to provoke people to argue and fight with you. You are wrong, you were never right to begin with. So shut up, and back down.
---
what did the new update do to stop teaming?
---
Too pretty for pain
---
Bull with 10 powercubes? Aww man
---
what exactly did supercell do to stop teaming
---
You’re cute. But I haven’t seen you actually tell me how my absolutely 100% correct points are wrong. So....there’s that. 😘
---
Dude just stop, you are wrong, no one is supporting you, so just stop it. Why are you insisting on your points? They are so invalid, and you are so immature, grow up and be more civilized. Why are you so toxic?
---
A brawl ball

Im kiding of course is better

How are they invalid dipshit? You just keep saying they’re invalid. Neither one of you unbelievably stupid people have made a single compelling argument against my 100% valid and true points. So keep telling me I’m wrong. Without telling me why I’m wrong. Fucking geniuses.

No
---
Good point. Still, good players know how to spread out, and Brocks would most likely spam you to death. Nonetheless, I see your point. Mortis could just pick them off one by one. Theres still the ammo problem though.....

That's trophy inflation in a nutshell

I don't really know how to explain it, someone else in this subreddit also complained of this and someone explained it to them so go check out that post.

---
Thunder cross split attack
---
Incoming Copypasta....
---
More skin... Hmmm...
---
Well with inflation in competition usually pans out.  Meaning that basically 9k is the new 5k.  I understand what you are saying.  Before I was 10k with a lot of friends sitting at 5-6k.  With the trophy change and life, I've only had time to push to 12.7k. While my friends are now 10k+.  But that doesn't really change as much, they skill have not improved and they will stall out.  My personal skill will take me further as competition continues to climb.  Essentially they moved the goal posts for what elite looks like, but that doesn't give everyone more skill.  It's an easier time climbing for them and for us.  With how it works now you are almost always in a net gain.  Lose 5 earn 8.  Even if you win/lose its a +3.  Before that it win/lose was 0.  Sometimes negative trophies.  As you climb though those numbers get back too 0.  Meaning that peoples progression won't be infinite, they will stall out and still hit there skill cap.

since i am bad here is my frame https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/cmaxun/here_is_my_thingy/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app

Of the day
---
Yeah it seems like i was teaming. But right after i saw the shelly didn’t responded i stopped teaming now! I just wanted to kill the highest power shelly cuz would be easier to finish the second
---
Jessie: Why have you betrayed me scrappy??? Whyyyyy?
---
Patience is the key.
---
Crow is so tiny.
---
ive been playing for less then 2 weeks and got crow yesterday
---
How much did you team?
---
Don’t worry it is friendly game and you have 8 teammates 
---
It is 9 vs 1 primo
---
Love the top left one!
---
He may have some muscles but he ain't even close to bull.
---

Nothing😂I like the meme
---
15k 25/27 (missing leon and spike?)
---
,dre"
---
23/27 getting your brawlers to 600 will get you to 13.8k trophies... They literally just changed the system so that you can get trophies easier. It’s easier to get to 700 trophies now than it was getting to 500 before the new system. Be patient and you’ll get some mythics quit acting like a baby.

disagree with the bo one, 16% damage is a lot

She wasn't released yet, he's just beta testing

That's not a skirt. It's SHORTS

Why did you post a screenshot of you posting the original picture?

Ok
---
I only see:  “i wAnT tHiNgS fReE”
---
She did nothing but shooting crates 😂
---
Epic animation, but I don't understand why this is humor
---
i got leon at 1k and didnt get a brawler until i hit 4k, and thats when i bought spike
---
I just wasted 0:13 seconds of my life
---
Glad it does. Enemies doesnt feel good mr stark.
---
I....think brawl talk is next month?....

#r/shittybrawlstars
---
It’s not cheating because anyone in a match can team, but organizes teaming in this regard refer to the act of intentionally joining the same  solo match to team through 3 third party communication app.
---
Its not that bad
---
My comment for the video: 0:28
---
Or talk about it in an art subreddit
---
That works too
---
It’s better to get a legendary first, because getting a mythic will lower your chances of getting legendary. And plus, getting any legendary is way better than getting Mortis
---
I’m a beta player and now I know how lucky I am
---
actually i don't think my work is really **realistic** so much...a little experssionism still in there
---
btw  thank you for your appreciation 😘
---
When a bush camper comes out of a bush Mortis can run, and he is viable on more than two game mods
---
This is my first post so i just picked a random flair
---
Nope once i was close to piper i take only 800 damage from that piper
---
Maybe she thought there were power cubes in them
---
every time see one try to team with me i team but... i cheat on him
---
why did his bulge get bigger? don't ask me why i was looking tho

Cute

Barley and Spike should have been in a tier called "Yes but no"

You got it!

*THAT IS SO SOLID*

And yet he lost

Just barley though.

No.

Was that an attempt at a pun?
---
Thx
---
Yes. I don't regret it.
---
What in the hot and spicy McDuck is this
---
Biggest oof. And also he still lost. If he was actually good he couldve done 3 min
---
I’ll request you ounce I can right now I’m busy
---
a lot of guys has put the question "how you can?" is so easy, he/she plays with a friend at showdown and they rearched 4 trophies!  ~~Its so easy man!~~
---
Yes.
---
Fuck no
---
What the HELL
---
You’ve taught her well...
---
How do you play barley well?

TAKE THIS LLLLL PRIMOOOOOOO

This sent my dynamite off
---
How did you get in Lwarb
---
I think you guys forgot they changed the shots from splash to homing. Meaning if it fired before you were out of it's range it's gonna hit you when your out of its range
---
Protect the queen/President???????
---
Technically it’s 2 Mega Boxes, 2 Big Boxes, and 2 Brawl Boxes since it’s a token doubler
---
This eat
---
For the rest of the world it's football
---
Stick a ROCKET on me!
---
Stop post this shit its Fake
---
PS1? how did you get there?
---
You telling me that teaming is not a superior strategy?
---
It's a medic
---
I always thought this game faked 3D terrain. I stand corrected? Any info?
---
idk about you but i killed several taras, pocos, and genes with mortis.
---
Us there a way to tell if you gonna get a new brawler in big boxes and small boxes????
---
maybe even leon in original state
---
true
---
i don't understand, it's a 3% chance to get them from a mega box, why do you people think they have a guaranteed legendary
---
Never
---
Same with cavern churn
---
he has a really strong super(  ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
#LWARB
---
Switch Morris and dynamike :P
---
I haven’t played brawl in a while teaming is still an issue????

Jokes on you I got both

This is not ok

I think she was probably playing too defensively.

It means thank you.

Literally nobody cares.

Oh but there is something better... it’s hidden within your comment... the “fucking bear”
---
Very nice drawing
---
I came here to confirm Rosa's 15th line among others
---
Thamk
---
Oh ok I didn’t know that
---
Like I said, I usually do. But if I don’t have people on to team with, I shouldn’t have to risk being paired with someone and their noob friend. Matchmaking will never be perfect, and I get that. But it needs improvement. And one of the easiest places they could improve is when people queue in with 2 people with vastly different trophy levels.

---
So every Brawler is bad. (Expect fkr penny)
---
Once you get a brawler to 400 trophies you unlock replays for that brawler. Or you can screen record, you have to turn that on beforehand to capture a game.
---
Well Tara now has Anime tits apparently
---
Shiba Nita is S Tier change my mind

Guys, I'm shaking. I'm fucking shaking. I never wanted to breed with anyone more than I want to with Bibi. That perfect, curvy body. Those bountiful breasts. The child bearing hips of a literal goddess. It honestly fucking hurts knowing that I'll never mate with her, pass my genes through her, and have her birth a set of perfect offspring. I'd do fucking ANYTHING for the chance to get Bibi pregnant. A N Y T H I N G. And the fact that I can't is quite honestly too much to fucking bear. Why would Supercell create something so perfect? To fucking tantalize us? Fucking laugh in our faces?! Honestly guys, I just fuck
---
Hmmm, level 13? Mabye your thinking of rank...

Fwuck wu

bare witness to my fitness

This is epic

Dude make sure your spelling is good before you post

Accurate
---
I'll be ur mother :/
---
I never knew rain made stuff wet
---
You learn new stuff everyday i guess
---
So where do Bibi mains fall into? (Btw I don't main characters thanks to trophy risk/reward)
---
Sad I got Leon and crow
---
That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard
---
Ok we can just all chill out. I originally asked this from supercell, but as I can see they not going to answer...
---
Even if people have low trophies that doesn’t mean they aren’t good but I do get where you’re coming from but still it is t matchmaking’s fault it’s people teaming fault for the hate towards matchmaking
---
Tell your friend that they did a really good job!
---
Fuck my lung
---
Im on it!
---
I only got legendary from regular boxes
---
No but it seems like the only thing you can really do since you cant access anything inside the game
---
Nice I got nothing. Was hoping for a new brawler or some Colt power points but neither.
---
I wish they made some amiibo like figures for brawl stars. I know they had the plushies for a little bit, but then they shut their merch store down. I also want one of those brawl stars had Frank has.  
---
I think this game is popular enough for merch to do decently.
---
Feels bad man

What do you think about the Omen club

Please just stop crap like this. I'v seen this comment on r/Brawl stars way too many times and it's not funny.

Piper op in brawl ball

change my mind

Ehm, no? I really don't give a f**k,  I am angry at oosing trophies because of Mr. Look-at-my-bralwer-that-I-intentionally-didn't-power-up-flexing-at-450 di**head

Yeah its RNG, thats the joke

Looks like the bottom GradeAUnderA’s mouth too

This is worth of being sold for hundreds of pounddm

24 brawlers is not that bad tho.

Thats josuke no doubts

If your playing with randoms then ur a random so ur trash too.
---
I am just curious if the developer has a daughter named Shelley, favorite actor is Shelley Duvall,  love of their life is named Shelley and so on. 
---
I just can't think of any reason a character should charge their super like she does, have the range she does and then on top of that gets multiple lives every 20 seconds. I can only think of one map she doesnt dominate showdown on.
---
Is this some kind of joke I’m too maxed out to understand ?

Thief.

Nah jk, a report button I needed

You really don't have a choice tho...... either team or they kill you

You mean GRASSS

---
Pls trash it at home

Maybe.
---
he's aware the bubble is different colors in-game, he's talking about the color of the bubble in the pic. It's blue instead of pink so he's saying it should be red to show it's the enemy's one
---
Power levels?

I THOUGHT YOU EDITED IT AT FIRST BUT I SAW

Lol

Pipers butterfly is mad aswell hah

I like to think that if Frank uses Mortis as a hammer, it makes bats instead of shockwaves
---
El primo got trophies
---
Man that's messed up
---
Then he press X
---
Are you P2W or F2P?
---
Yes , that too 😂
---
I feel like a lot of his videos have been low effort recently.
---
If you have a lot of brawlers maxed out then you will get PP's only for the brawlers that are lower power than 9
---
He reminds me of a pro golfer, maybe that should  be a skin.
---
The year of the pig...
---
Thanks!

Jazeker kerel

Ehh..
---
No emojis
---
Excuse me what the fuck
---
Wtf
---
That's fine but if they did a collaboration they would make skin too. My opinion ..🤔🤔
---
Trash...
---
Really, it comes down to who you are best at playing. The wizard guy you might be talking about is barley, because he has a wizard skin. He has weaknesses, however all of the Brawlers have a certain weakness in them. If you're good at playing barley, upgrade him, so you can climb in trophies.
---
I have leon but 0 mythical and no penny so it sucks either way
---
That Brock is a really bad player.
---
Y r u so horny also penny is like 15 I think
---
Fantastic!
---
no, they basically DM'd BS bugs 100 times to add their character.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
and that's where babies come from. 
---
or is it from pam still...
---
Awe, Spike just wants everyone to be friends!
---
Don't give up man! This looks better than what I can do. Just keep practicing and since you aren't very fond of the face likely, then just draw faces of Brawlers to get better at it. All it comes down to is practicing, that's the only way to get better.
---
The height comparison is pretty on point! Great artwork!
---
It's bull you idiot.

More health, more damage, super and attacks insta charge, more speed

Brock with super

Complete it

team pairing does not work, look at the level of cups that macofloud has. Being that I'm in the 8000 glasses

That star player bo was hands down the best player in the match and he has low trophies

Isn't it a little too big?

10/10 since it included colt :&gt;

I'm still figuring out how you get colt,I only have 2 trophies
