Can you give me link for the original post? I just thought this in my head √æytyy(after losing 50trophies on my jessie)
---
I hate when I (or my partner)  wait for the other to spawn with 5+ Power Cubes on the floor and someone starts heading our way and we have to pick them up and run before the other spawns. That breaks my heart üíî
---
Rosa literally isn‚Äôt broken lol

---
When you‚Äôre in the lower end of trophies (no offense) Bull and Shelly do seem overpowered. Just stick with it, and you‚Äôll notice that they both become useless.
---
Is this a jojo refrence?
---
It gets pretty difficult ppl start to know what they‚Äôre doing around 150 trophies...
---
Imagine the screen shaking when it is charged
---
Or Shelly lol (10K player here). On the other hand, they both suck.
---
Just because im sick of low effort memes taking over new. The same jokes too. Worst ones are reposts

Shelly

Leon. Makes him so much better while shelly is helpful, but does not make her way better. Its like mortis' star power vs penny star power. One star power makes them so much better while the other is helpful but no game changer.
---
So srry, I will make sure to feed him :(
---
##YES,PLEASE
---
Those are some expensive prices to spectate and to enter! Very good! (btw, what grade are you?)
---
# CutCut
---
Yeah getting zero trophies just cause you cut out at the end isn't very fair it should be a majority game thing, if you cut out last 20 seconds or top 3 showdown you should still get the reward

Had 7 kills at that point couldn‚Äôt let them bush campers win why because thats what i do, thats a clip from a video I uploaded on you tube check it out

Ah you said fom your so dumb you POS you should honestly just delete Reddit you loser lmao üòÇüòÇüòÇ

Maybe Supercell can put a toggle to switch whether to use star power or not

The real question is that Legendary at 1000 trophies?

Yeah thats part of playing above 400 you cant risk dying easy or being too aggressive. Why do you say the spike carried me?
---
F
---
That's good news what you talking about
---
He is overrated. Hear me out though. In order to encourage more aspiring artists to produce works like he does, we need to give him as much praise as possible.

Damn right, set the record.

You actually inspired me to do my BiBi and Spike art. Pls check it o it senpai! &gt;_&lt;

Well at that point it's the smartest move, there's no point in leaving them behind for the other team to snatch, or you get killed.

Who tf up voted this past 420?

Its not rule 34, go away

How about Spike giving Rosa his flower

We bandwagon but 1hr later

You should be able to join a good club

What if I told you Gene and Bibi can and will die to a Poco point-blank? Gene has a horrible reload, and just strafe on top of Bibi. If people knew how to play Brawl Stars they'd try Bounty with Poco.

this is where id put my plantium award IF I HAD ONE

It‚Äôs according to the highest trophies brawler in the team, opponent colt has 445 so it‚Äôs not tht big difference (the colt might be in a room with the other two
---
it means that if users all collectively decide to up- or downvote someone (mostly the latter). By hiding the votes for the first hour (or few hours in other subreddits) it is hoped that this happens less, because we can't know if someone is being downvoted by everyone or not

Just did 80 tickets on the event and opened all the boxes I got ( have double tokens also). And this little fella popped up.

Super happy and lucky I know o//

1st of all nice one deleting the newest reply because you fucked up, but I still saw and here‚Äôs the response. yea number 2 locally not globally stupid. I also didn‚Äôt say ‚Äúnumber 2 tribe club‚Äù but there you go again with your illiterate self just assuming things. but Incase you‚Äôre wondering we‚Äôre also 104 globally. ü§£And How am I wrong lmao? (Rhetorical question Incase ya dumbass didn‚Äôt already know) everything you say clearly makes you sound pissed off and adding laughing emojis doesn‚Äôt make your pain go away knowing that you‚Äôve been so oblivious and stupid the whole time. Whenever I call you out you never come back with a rebuttal. You ignore that fact that I proved you wrong and then to deflect you try and point something out about me. I‚Äôve proved you wrong about everything you brought up but ok chief, whatever you say to make yourself feel better. And yea I‚Äôd say 10 is sufficient for a casual player because I don‚Äôt spend 8 hours a day on brawl stars and max out mommy‚Äôs credit card on gems trying to max all your brawlers, trying to ‚Äúbe the best‚Äù. you brag every chance you get on your profile and some for reason think that you‚Äôre better than everyone else and have some sort of special circumstance. No one cares that your maxed or that you got 13k because you don‚Äôt have a social life. This is my last reply because I‚Äôm getting bored constantly shutting down your ego trip. Have a nice life there bud

Just 1 54 mins after posting this I got carl

Btw im only a global player at 7.2k only have colt n darryl star power only colt os at 500 i had darryl at 467 but tilted him bad trying to push and once i got to 430 the randoms were more stupid which tilted me more im at 387 ill fix that later tho on a good map for darryl

Words cant describe the pain when your friend who played the game for 2 days gets a legendary and then quits.........meanwhile we are struggling to get even one epic from a 100 boxes at 6-10k trophies

When there is a loading or matchmaking screen or something like this they should have a message saying that there is NO WAY to get free gems

Wow!!!! Awesome work dude!

No that is about someone connecting to your account on a different device

Too true

Nah, Bibi is just like Carl, she's underpowered as fuck at her release, but wait, she's going to be OP in 2 months from now.

Well done!

My friend did that as well but as both our brawlers were under 400 we couldn't get footage.

This is very good idea to reduce the amount of clueless ransdom. Nice job

And overused

I missed my spike screenshot coz i closed the game in hopes of not opening the box but now i have your screenshot

I kicked out cause of my team mate in dou showdown was a dynamike

Yeah,it is.

I dont know i dont have her and havent seen her enough. But i think she is find

Oh god thanks. MORTIS BRINGER OF DOOM

I may be braindead but who is NoobMaster69 and what is special about him?

Bo can't kiss cause he is too busy of thinking about wind and nature

Does it just not display properly on iOS?

Welcome back pal.

Try it the other way around.Spongebob is 9 dynas.

especially piper
---
My favorit map in sd [*] for caver churc
---
Weeee more brawl stars cancer wooo
---
totally not useless or anything!
---
Just what i was gonna say, i can hit his shots well but if i know i can out burst some one at close range ill just move towards then then follow their movements auto aiming because thats what you do when you have to
---
Thats you fr? üòÇ
---
would be fun for darryl
---
Glorious...
---
No a specific one costs less
---
bruh
---
Bakesale Barley, the skin you targeted, has special animations for his attack, each one looking slightly different from the rest.
---
EEEEEEEELLLL PRRRRRRIIIMOOOOOO
---
Just... Just go with it
---
Tbh, I wasn't expecting this to be added. Any water-vased map will be op for Darryl and bull.
---
PRRRRRRRIIIIIMMMMMMOOOOOOOOO
---
Yes, that's true too.
---
But then it would be making Morgz look cool.
---
Imagine playing man hunt as Bibi and the hunter is el primo
---
It matters the rank of the charachter you played with not your throphies
---
i only see 2 seasons
---
probably had loads of coins and boxes saved up
---
Oh. Yeah I know that, I just don‚Äôt think my post should be removed because it‚Äôs actually somewhat decent compared to what hits the front page

is your friend turkish

Amazing such a difference, now I can buy him
---
Nice tits fo sho, id slap that ass ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
All his other brawlers are maxed.
---
How you know?
---
Youtubers would get broke. What could they teach us lol
---
Well... I would suggest El primo to hunt a different person down...
---
I like your Tara and shadow art picture :)
---
I want this map,Would be great for tanks n close range brawlers, Tanks Away
---
Wait, wheres spikes flower
---
game lang is turkish
---
Well i have like 3 brawlers power 10 at 300+ trophies too, the rest are 400 or max. Just that I dont play them often, just been upgrading them after maxing out. Maybe the same situation here haha.
---
Well, yes, he is ^^
---
The map was made by the community not supercell
---
I know that sub already
---
Thanks.
---
The bushes stuck inside the water part might get a little out of hand but great map other than that
---
He could hunt everyone else, but he‚Äôd never get you.
---
You could follow him around the entire map and just pester him the same way a Crow would, Crow is annoying enough since he has range and speed, but Bibi seems reachable since she has short range, but no, she‚Äôs untouchable.
---
Ig there trying not to make it look like that, to bad the shape of the swastika limits a bit of design
---
Pay to win.....i am a f2p but i have 7000 trophies and i am playing from global
---
I've done one in 47 seconds before.

This template was made by me, just to not get confused. Also, who is the guy you are talking about?

Lol. How in the actuall hell?
---
Flair your post before 
---
Your post has been removed
---
I really dont know
---
It‚Äôs an awesome idea! The only problem is that the game wouldn‚Äôt be profitable anymore for SC and then they would simply shut down it because it requires more resources than it gets.

Trophies earned??

No problem.

How to unlock BIBI brawl stars
---
nice save, I'm sure this was all just a big prank, wow, such a bamboozle
---
Why is it called ike?
---
Mods! Fix this at once! /s
---
I mean like "get millions of gems free" websites
---
Kinda pointless for the bushes if like Piper can just come with and snipe the box
---
Maybe the spawn location can be behind the box?
---
I‚Äôd put wonder-brad up top
---
IKR
---
Yea but I have a 360 trophy pwr 10 barley
---
Thats cool i did some crazy stuff below 400 but couldn‚Äôt get footage also check out my channel if you dont mind it should be on a comment i posted
---
Lol, so, is it good or bad ü§î?
---
Hahaha üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Because it‚Äôs way faster to max legendary in brawl stars once you unlock it.
---
nothing wrong lmao
---
K
---
Teach me this power of yours
---
People pulled by Gene's Super: Am I a joke to you?
---
This will never be added
---
Rush ppl at close rang if you can out burst them keep your distance lead your shots aim well and walk where your opponent walks to hit more shots
---
Fantastic work
---
I'm willing to take longer matchmaking to fix these things.
---
Nice work mate!
---
Right ok. Thanks
---
Maybe 5v5 mode? On some huge map, showdown style ( teammates respawning ), etc.

Don‚Äôt feed the troll, guys.

Like how u give each Brawler 2 box on spawn

Make it more awstgetic makes no sense, aesthetic isn‚Äôt a noun you dipshit. Go back to school before you start calling people older than you, kids, lol.

This nibba is Not getting more Skins

Congrats on unlocking Leon!

Yes, but actually Colt.
---
Next nivel is artists
---
yes but the button was like that from before

FOR REAL HAHAHAHAHAHHQHQHQ

Her main attack can leave behind paint strokes of different colors and her super can be a blob of rainbow paint lmao. The possibilities.
---
why use much word when less word do trick

Sorry I had to  bypass the whole error setup it seems to not like certain topics. Anyways my apologies for my grammar and spelling. I know it's awful but if you can look past that then I thank you for reading and please try and take what I me ton seriously, I'm not here to play the let's troll the OP (me) but if you feel your like to please send me a private message and we can play that game outside reddit. I aim for this to be somewhat Hope's their are others who might feel the same way that gaming (which was once meant as an escape from RL stresses and open opportunities take those curveballs life those at us all. Yet now it's more like a job to play a game, where all I see and hear is how much a company can make of its users (the players/you &amp; me) while we will never own the these games in any form or fashion get they can own our personal information we willingly hand over to them, and they are at the assumption that they are entitled to sell that and profit further with 3rd party marketing and abuse streamers, content creators to generate even more ROI (return on investment) from these people while they make some funds they are only receiving pennies where as the corporations head and board members rack in the billions of dollars nearly every day if not weekly only to invest that into creating more ways to manipulate its users to generate more for themselves. How long until anyone really cares? Or does anyone even care? If not then I'm done and this is the end of my efforts to fix a persistent problem.

TLDR; NO problem go back and win some solo showdown.

Sorry to say this but I don‚Äôt think you will get a buff anytime soon but if you guys did get one I would want you guys to have wider attacks instead of having one long one like the wide of the attack should be like bibi‚Äôs and also get real who can dash like that (The beta version of mortis) but the other buff should be your super increase how much health you get from one brawler
---
Please don‚Äôt attack me I‚Äôm just a poor Poco
---
Clearly not you.

How are we suppose to know that then?

I think tara doesnt need any remodel, i think she looks nice. They should remodel piper cuz she is looking boring

r/PocoGang
---
It‚Äôs THAT bad
---
OMEGA OOF
---
Because to max a legy in brawl stars the hardest part is unlocking it. Getting legy powerpoints is much easier as the droprate isnt ridiculous. In CR you unlock the legendary and then you need to do that in the same terrible odds 35 more times. That is much harder then getting a lot of powerpoints
---
Thanks for disqualifying this even more...
---
Their piper : normal

It's reddit's system that is horrible, I've made one too

Metal Bat (OPM) is Josuke with a bat, change my mind.
---
Btw it's cool! üòÄ

Thanks I tried being completely fair for people giving everyone an equal experience :)
---
BMM ü§Ø was amazing!
---
I now just have to collor it in.
---
Like WTF you dont even explain main attack neither super and u complain no one likes it
---
Cruel
---
Read the entire comment thread i posted the link to the original on my old account
---
Its a skin,not a Brawler idea.
---
Also its very clearly on the top of him.
---
Wooooww
---
Here is my new account
---
Well thanks,at least you.
---
I like metal bat
---
Hello, Hello, Hello.
---
And my old account
---
You used to be able to get common brawlers in brawlboxes
---
Sucks
---
I edited the comment
---
Is it just me,or bottom right one is kinda looks like a pp?
---
Don't use Frank...
---
Give her a voice
---
Make sure not to make a sound
---
WHAT ARE YOU DOING!?
---
First she needs to be remodeled
---
Yeah I definitely think making opponents use ammo on it is good. I‚Äôm just saying I don‚Äôt feel the synergy. Unlike   Nika‚Äôs bear, Tara‚Äôs clone is really fast. I can‚Äôt catch up and utilize it for blocking.
---
Really
---
Yeah, that‚Äôs the one thing it‚Äôs really good at.
---
Thank u guys so much ‚ù§Ô∏èü§©
---
LOL AND THAT WASNT EVEN ON PURPOSE
---
Yess
---
Wow, this is unexpected! This post is over 40d old where did you find it XD?
---
Cool u have any brawlers to climb
---
darryl: I was born for this!!!
---
Is that a face reveal i see?
---
Also,very nice skin
---
how do you like the map?
---
wow beatiful
---
Yup, that's my work. You can always check my profile. üëçüèΩ
---
I just found "cursed" on this subreddit (It is absolutely not an offence)
---
On purpose obviously. Or maybe someone else got his phone and trolled him.
---
spike wth
---
Y'all awesome with those encouraging comments; thank you so much ü§©üëçüèΩ
---
üòÇüòÅ
---
Yea spike
---
Imagine calling yourself *Mega*RayQuaza, posting/mocking on /r/im14andthisisdeep and telling others to shut up.
---
Yikes.
---
I wish they still had the stories for their flavor text instead just a summary of their attacks, which you already get.
---
11k no legendary. You haven't had the worst of it
---
guys stop being so toxic he is oboiusly a freaking troll the best thing is jsut to ignore it
---
Ricochet dropping mad bars
---
That's not a smile. That's an angry face.
---
Yeah.
---
P.S. how many legendaries do you have? I have 2/4 - Spike and Mortis
---
Forget Upvotes, I‚Äôm following you ;D
---
Woah that‚Äôs nice! Upvote!
---
Or if, in your match there's someone having a 400+ brawler the replay would be available to you as well.
---
Trolling or doing it on purpose is just sick.. All that hard work. If it were like CR (where you get 30 trophies for winning), no one would have cared.
---
Ey lois remember the time I autoaimed my super
---
Username checks out.
---
I've played since beta and i'm only at 6k, which to be fair, isnt a lot and I havent gotten carl. Im ftp btw.
---
mortis dashing was the best part r/mortisgang
---
Shut up and take my karma
---
Maybe... but how would you feel if you were on the losing side?
---
dammmmn you lucky lil boi
---
I guess you will draw Sans instead of üÖ±Ô∏èoco
---
Hmm I guess your right but I dunno it could be something else, anyways thanks for your opinion :-)
---
r/CursedImages

His landing was too predictable so basically a free kill. The current super allows him to be more of an assassin

80 gems for a recolor

She beats the devil out of them.

Different attack animation

That‚Äôs too good of an offer, I think it should be 1 gem per 250 gold

This is my first map and post

I just finished re-drawing it! :D https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/bszkcc/sooo_i_found_a_cool_skin_idea_made_by_ubrlg234/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share

And he bird?

This art needs more recognition!
---
Thank you! :)
---
DONG!
---
Thanks red circle, very epic
---
My friend have bo and he just have 750 trophee
---
Huh. I really like that saying.
---
Bro leon is inspired by chameleons because of the camp thing
---
Not only was the random really bad at the game he/she was a newcomer with a total trophy count of only 272 in a match full of brawlers with power level 6-8 and players with total trophy counts of around 6000-9000. Why in the fuck does this matchmaking system do this? This isn't the first time I've seen this happen. I've once seen a newcomer on the other team several weeks ago.
---
Awesome!
---
Also,what program do you use to make those cool neon effects?
---
Not watching that whole damn thing, next time just post a clip
---
thank you, having legendaries in the shop for gold would be suicide
---
Looks great!
---
Now imagine if Supercell added nightmode and this skin would glow in the dark.
---
AW YEAAA TURNIN' UP THE BOOM BOX!
---
OK,who cares,its a meme.It is supposed to be spread out,and also you can make this in MS paint in like a minute
---
You are a really underapprciated artist. I've seen your profile and I am surprised that you haven't gotten more attention. Btw, ur Freeza art is probably my favourite üòÅüòÅ
---
Everybody knows that Leon are a chamaleon, but this one is a realistic one.
---
Who said she wasn‚Äôt lmao
---
It's nice being nice!
---
I saw this post, thought about it for a while, then opened up brawl stars (this was yesterday) And after a couple of boxes, i got leon, then, today, i got bibi from a big box. Thanks man.
---
No one

Jessie: Say hello to my little friend ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)

Actually I think it is something like a wrapped cangpdy like a jolly rancher

AND that bubble gum probably damaged them after the hit. Wow.

Haha, you do not even think so u/GEDI-KOR

;-; remodel...?
---
Awesome, you got discord?

@blarekid
---
That weird your a dine a Mike lmao
---
The most beautiful face I have ever seen. Awesome work.
---
I do but im not that active in discord i use messenger
---
She's probably in her 20s
---
I didn‚Äôt really like the animations. It‚Äôs quite when she throws it. I mostly use green spike
---
Sick
---
ok cool what's your messenger? @blarekid
---
Carl wouldn't play a game on a phone he doesn't have time because the rocks are too cool
---
Lul when was darryl the leader of that? He is an assasin just like mortis so they have something together üòà

Is it Kingdom?

Gems for gold

Keep dreaming
---
upvote my arse
---
Make Carl pls
---
Soooo. Should I
---
I heard that back then getting duplicate brawlers was possible and you could get chips from them which you could use to buy new brawlers.
---
Rosa has 1 hp
---
That's more: Spike that half o im have the N-word Pass
---
What are you talking about? It‚Äôs a *EPIC* offer, I would do anything do get that discount!
---
SEE YOU LATERR
---
Y E S
---
Take my upvote for sure
---
That's horrible
---
Lolantics said ‚Äúhe‚Äôs‚Äù out here
---
If they do this then they are going to have to adjust how many trophies you gain therefore making it slower to push.
---
Rosa is my game, Botany is my name. Wait-
---
Thief, there us no denying like are you dumb or what!
---
I destroyed mine‚Äôs screen today playing solo sd

what site/app is it?

Dude I care and you did a pretty good job

Pretty useless tho, I got pumped up and trolled the guy xD

Hits cactus, rolls over river into storm ;-;
---
I'm fine with being called hyphen. lol
---
Trash, not going to be in game!
---
"This is my first epic"
---
*has 2 epics*
---
Brawlers had backstories back then and the backstory for spike says ‚Äúspike is the last of the cactus people.‚Äù
---
This is so bad! What the heck is this!
---
Brock should be higher and imo primo should be S tier, his voice lines add so much to his character when you play with him. And yeah rosa could have had so much potential but imo the accent doesn't suit her and sounds uninspired.
---
Just... It went from you sending, then me drawing, and then you finding.
---
She has a pony tail
---
You ruined it XD
---
Hey she has a YouTube channel called Melody‚Äôs Art please if we could go and give her our support it would be awesome!
---
That's not the point here
---
Someone should make robot versions of all the human brawlers and vice versa
---
Hmmm, well I can always adjust it next time...
---
For now I just want to make her short for the sake of this joke hehe
---
No please don‚Äôt do it
---
1790000 ft

EXCELLENT! My mission is complete!

P.s. It is original shelly 3d model from bs
---
I don‚Äôt think Tara needs a remodel I think she fine right now.
---
Yeah I've got Pam offer too.. instead of 170 gem to 169 ... are they serious about those offers?! üò°
---
I can live with that!
---
Incredible.
---
Then explain the photo on the top
---
the truth is you can't dodge anything in this game really just move around

Frank thicc?
