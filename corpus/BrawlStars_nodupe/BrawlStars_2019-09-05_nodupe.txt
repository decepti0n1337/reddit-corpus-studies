This is just playing with word still the same star power
---
---
---
Man you are good with dinamike
---
Rip
---
Lol you are joking
---

---
1) destroy the super turret
---
2) go behind any wall. Tick is so slow
---
3) heal up
---
4) win because you have 11 power ups
---
Nobody will see it coming until it's too late
---
Good Job! Your bull already have Star power?! I only got a Star power on 7k! And God's job again!
---
Yeah, but then it's over, you only get to use it once per match, and you don't even get to choose, so the first time it's used it gets used up, not OP IMO

thank you!! i expected to get some heat because bull is "the easiest brawler to use" but never the less i'm still proud :)
---
Nice job!
---
Believe or not. I am.
---
Even worse than band-aid
---
Yes...? It makes the star power name way cooler than it is currently.
---
Hit 'em with that moonwalk
---
there are people who have been playing for 2 years, above 15k trophies who don't have any legendaries. yup, very normal
---
Thanks

To hard to friikin reead

I'd just like to say the reason we 360-ed was because we clutched this round 3 times I'll give link to full video soon

Really good. It will become great hopefully.

I hate this clan.
---
I guess you r right
---
I thought is was going to be called that yesterday for some reason
---
It's not even just that. Band-Aid and Extra Life in general are not even broken mechanics. It's just that Band-Aid/Extra Life on Shelly is the most game-breaking combination. Who knows why Supercell thought it would be a good idea to give a brawler with a 1-shot button a heal? If they gave Colt Band-Aid literally no one would complain because it doesn't fundamentally change the way he's gonna be played, it's just gonna make his durability a bit higher. 8-Bit with Extra Life in SD is very underwhelming, but it has its niche use as a team suicide retriever (both teams blow each other up) but WAIT, 8-Bit is the slowest character in the game!
---
Extra life is extremely broken in showdown, and can occasionally be useful in brawl ball and siege. Boosted booster is generally better than extra life in 3v3 modes, and provides more  consistent value.
---
What movie is that from?
---
I would like to imagine he says all of this but in his own language, which is what he do right now
---
Reasons why rbrawlstars sucks
---
You'd think they wouldn't add stuff like this now (cough cough band aid)
---
No
---
I never thought of that way
---
It needs a buff, not a nerf
---
How do you put a brawler icon next to your name
---
I always laugh when somebody kills me because I'm near death from a previous fight and then they spin. It's so stupid haha. When somebody spins from a well fought victory I gotta respect the hustle
---
Yup. I hate the people that keep teaming. Whenever someone startd spinning at me, I spin back, get close, and kill em. Hope they learn their lessons
---
Yep. Ridiculously OP
---
Hello? u/inSpumoni
---
aR sLaSh EmOjI pOlIcE
---
Oh wow. So that's how the guy did a solo heist win in the other vid
---
Is there a limit for battling no there isn't
---
You can come back once after dying. That's your 1 star power, rest of the match is normal. It's maybe OP in SD against certain people but 8bit is slow and plenty of brawlers should be able to rock his world upon respawning. Anybody but Bibi and Crow I guess?
---
You just actually just need skill to pull off this brawler then he is really strong
---
Crow
---
Ooh Barley could be splash potions
---
 probably a match under 5oo trophies
---
Yeah I just noticed that when playing showdown
---
That’s no moon...
---
It's cool tho
---
I dont think that Spike is teaming, I think he is spinning to BM the Frank he killed.
---
I thought the same LMAO.
---
Shelly's bandaid before nerf now seems like trash
---
Seriously tho, why they didn't fix the worst spawn? Literally if u spawn in there you have to go middle or hide to 5th/6th place.
---
Break the box open and see for urself
---
I may be lucky but I have everyone but spike,leon,Mortis,and Gene I have 12.6k trophies
---
TNT= Dynamike super,
---
Cacti= spike ,
---
Parrots=crow, with leather jacket and everything,
---
Iron golem= Nita’s bear,
---
Crossbow could be piper’s umbrella sniper,
---
Axe= franks hammer,
---
Maybe the diamond armor can be mortis, cuz he da best. Top hat is the helmet, and so on. 
---
Swords can be bibi’s bat,
---
Barrel= Darryl ,
---
Just turn bull into a cow lmao.                          
---
The dogs can be scrappy, but without the thing coming out his mouth.           
---
The paintings could be brawler icons, like the icon you unlock at lvl 120.
---
Jukebox could be 8bit (idk about that one tho)
---
Wither boss= robo boss, but he goes through the different stages like the wither does.
---
I would definitely download this. These are some of my ideas, cuz I really want this texture pack to be finished. This is some next level stuff.
---
My god, this is frustrating af
---
Me in showdown playing Leon with 147 trophies but maxed upgraded:
---
Nighttime boxes?
---
Been off for a while, is this respawning thing a bug?
---
It's so strange I've never seen them before
---
Yes this is against bots, I don’t have him maxed level yet
---
Not at Supercell HQ :)
---
This is upsetting
---
MOOOOOOON FESTIVAL! HAVE U LIVED UNDER A ROCK SINCE BRAWL TALK?
---
Lol. Possible skin confirmed?
---
Can you link it to me too please and thanks?
---
NO IT'S MOON FESTIVAL! CHECK REDDIT BEFORE POSTING STUFF LIKE THIS! IT'S EVERYWHERE
---
This is why u need read the Update Log
---
Gene Party
---
Moon festival
---
BrOoOo people need stop thinking they know all about updates
---
If u heard about it and ask about it,get some help...
---
a win like this should give you 20 trophies
---
Well first of all they should at least make it so he reappears  right away instead of him disappearing then appearing after a couple seconds. Secondly, I don’t think they should nerf his damage but rather nerf his range. I’m not saying a big nerf but even if he is slow, having the range he has now makes him very hard to kill especially with the amount of damage he has. I agree that extra life is actually as balanced as it comes.
---
I haven't heard anything about it untill o git into a game and saw those boxes
---
This is the most balanced fan map I’ve seen in the game, great job designing it!
---
Yes plz
---
Meanie
---
Imagine if the boss was a mortis lol
---
This is a repost
---
Bruh,Moon festival,Read the update notes =-=
---
## bruh 🙌🙌🤣🤣😤
---
I’m just as confused as you are
---
Moon festival...did u read the update notes?
---
People who chase you right off the bat are dumb as shit. They waste their time they could be spending getting boxes but instead just drive you into someone else who ends up killing you.
---
Too late for krimas
---
Well that would most likely be in showdown.  8bit is closer to a support character and excels  in  gemgrab and maybe heist.
---
Remove some water, did everybody forget about the ball - water glitch?
---
One answer and a reason:Moon festival and... did u read the update notes...?
---
It's OP in certain gamemodes for sure.
---
100% accurate even the shelly with 0-3 power cubes that was me
---
Moons
---
damn bro why you snitchin

why this guy snitchin

First thing I did on this game was mute it lmaoo. Can't have that annoying ass sound come up in class lol
---
but hey, at least the gems are not on the enemy side
---
Very cool. Crossover episode
---
Mortis's shovels can be a iron shovel with Riptide embedded into it.
---
No it isn't? You're seeing something that isn't even there.
---
Here in India it’s early 😅
---
Oh so funny haha fucking shitty while the good people only get 30
---
Yeah NES themed for sure, not SNES like KT said.  I also agree the star power should have a different name.  I think the concept of Extra Life is too low hanging, tho.  Maybe call it Cheat Code, or Reboot.  The Extra Life concept is just too easy.
---
Yes, now that lingering potions are a thing. Doesn’t even need modding. Just use a commandblock.

Looks like you're too good for her. She can't even understand the language of the gods!!

No..... He's perfect.... Like Pam.....

It take me about 20 min just to do that again again and again in friendly match for 1 prepect video.
---
For some people who are not wanting to spend gems or open boxes,it is best for them to spend their coins on star powers.
---
Everyone has their own choice
---
Missed opportunity to put the “sadly yes” as gameover screen on 8bit.
---
I would choose Extra Life
---
I think he was talking about Roomiers message
---
&gt;Ye. They should keep him how he is but ner his nee star power. That's ridiculous lol
---
That’s a great idea
---
666k
---
Wow,me with one epic at 10,5k
---
when a new brawler comes out, everyone is playing it, so it puts some of them into other trophy ranges to avoid more than one 8 bit in the same team.
---
Congratulations!
---
I also achieved 10K trophies yesterday!
---
now I'm kind of starting to see some posts on the boxes

Stop bugging supercell already stfu already

He was spining in  the wrong area aside from family that actually protects.

I noticed that both power boxes and power points changed their design but I can't seem to find anything mentioning it. Also after last week's update my game's animations seemed to lag a bit and they no longer do. I'd appreciate it if anyone can provide some insight.

HALF MOON EVENT 
---
#HALF FUCKING MOON EVENT
---
Yaas! but still is hard to see and almost everytime the match lags the first 2 seconds even with good connection... Or maybe I have slight sight problems lol
---
The main goal is making it easier to see, just a QoL change.
---
Meh

Stfu its balanced because they also got one

What's??!!

I think it should cost $.25 to resurrect.
---
i honestly have lost your line of thought
---
The thing is that Penny sometimes do 3000+ damage when hitting brawlers that are too close to each other.
---
nothing they just changed the sprite of boxes to celebrate the moon festival and they also added a megabox + gem + money deal

good meme but r/uselessnobody

After band aid gets nerf and supercell basically release and another band aid

Well ok then

I know it's not necessary but I'd like for there to be a power lvl 11 as a means of showing that you've gathered both star powers.

I meant "Moon Festival"
---
Tick: Were you killed?
---
8-bit: Sadly, yes...
---
8-bit: BUT I LIVED
---
Impossible it is for 30
---
I understand that but it really ticks me off that people think something as low as 9k is extremely high. Especially with the recent trophy change i never liked it, i feel like it ruined the game and that trophies are too easily earned. Sure, theres new ranks now but that just brings me to my second point: if theyre gonna change the trophy system, WHY WAIT A WHOLE 2 MONTHS BEFORE ADDING NEW RANKS. They couldve either A, added the new ranks during the june update alongside the trophy change OR B, wait till they got back from holiday to do the exact same thing.
---
Maybe they couldnt have done it in time before the holiday and i understand that, but why would they post half of the huge change and leave it at a cliff hanger making ladder completely unbalanced for 2 months. Moment i heard about the change i
---
Lost insterest in brawl stars. Its as if my opinion of it was corrupted, even though they technically fixed it by adding new ranks, the damage to it was already done.
---
I know few others think this way if any, but id give anything to have the old trophy system and just 20 ranks....
---
How? How do you Get the bug?
---
Yep, and the shitposts with it.
---
I know that's a big deal for some people to be in his meme review video so congrats. But to me this is beyond what you think of as a meme. This is a proper comic and it's wonderful.

What are you smoking? I got 500 trophies in one day playing showdown with 8-bit
---
Song sauce?
---
But this on is too, and its 5 times as much
---
well, I love 24/7 brawl ball, but they should at least add another slot or decrease the time between gamemodes in 4th slot
---
I have 13k all brawlers except legendaries
---
You'd just have to make it so he gets +0 speed from those, right? Not THAT hard I don't think.
---
Look similar to freealand art
---
It's normal
---
well, it's a skin recolour not just recolour
---
And what's this? A brand new skin?
---
I sort of got lucky on that one
---
Yeah
---
That’s to say Bibi with a shotgun instead of a bat...
---
I made one with but Shelly instead of random brawler but it's ok, idk if it's even even made after yours :)
---
8bit is new, have him on power 2.

Yea I did see someone suggest that the 5th slot should be used for the others on the weekdays

Well, if you have every mythic and legendary, then yes, but if not, then wait for an offer for that brawler to come out since frank isn’t that good right now.

Yeah but they didn't bother to change the icon next to your name

How do I get it?

Why y’all mad about that title  I just put that because you cant post a meme without it :/

I have a reason for making this bedrock. Reason A.) Brawl Stars is a mobile game, and Minecraft Bedrock is available on most of not all mobile platforms. So I would much rather shoot to the broader audience on this first. Reason B.) I find it much easier to load new textures into my Bedrock games, because it's just one click to import.
---
O... M... G!!!
---
That crazy right😎
---
With the gems you have, you could buy one of those offers that have legendary brawlers AND a skin that comes with it ;) better to save up
---
I've answered my reasoning already. Sorry, but Bedrock is my first choice on this simply because it's on mobile, like the game Brawl Stars.
---
He own goaled 2 times, you do know how to count right?
---
Rico gonna kill you from the other side of the map.
---
Oh I didn't see that sorry
---
Congrats! it took me 8 months to get to 13k and I'm a F2P

I would happily work with them if they did!

Man. This comment makes me extremely sad now. Rip to one of the best maps.

I figured it out , that s smart

The thing is I didn’t make it sooooo..

---
He could be maxed and stockpile boxes from tick release to find all power points to upgrade 8-bit istant and then find the star power/buy it in the shop. If you are maxed you have a huge amount of gold unused. Not necessarily a p2w. Also he could have waited to grind 8-bit to high ranks to do this more easily
---
It will be released! This was a rough idea of what I wanted to do, hence the trashy barley hand. I am going to be putting more effort into this, and am definitely going to make sure it's as good as it can be for you all!
---
You're seeing the shot animation going through the robot right? And it's not dealing any damage right? How is that not a bug/glitch. Explaining why the glitch happens doesn't make it no a glitch.
---
It writes  your team is full
---
Penny's gonna give us a bad time.
---
I'm actually making the iron sword into her bat! But maybe add some sweeping edge to that? It would really recreate her attack then.
---
alright, cool
---
I'm f2p and have 15k trophy(no legendary)
---
It s the summer of robots
---
It is! It's a rough draft from 1-2 hours of work. But I am mainly making it for bedrock, the version compatible with mobile. When it's released I'll make sure you all get to know!
---
They are boxes and power cubes
---
what is the gltich?
---
I always play solo showdown and met someone called jaden very often
---
That's gonna need a data pack my friend. Not there yet. ;)
---
I kow but you beg moon and you have cube.
---
I know but you beg moon and you have cube.
---
HOW CAN I JOIN A GANG
---
I was thinking about doing an axe as well, but decided to do one brawler reference to start. I want to make sure every brawler is seen in this first.
---
"Beg moon and you have cube"?
---
True
---
...potions of lingering damage?
---
Stockpiling sounds difficult. I’m level 80 and have no brawler over 8. So he must have had more boxes than I did in first 80 levels, not?
---
Ooh
---
Thrower heaven right here
---
Yeah totally
---
It was changed based on popularity. The games in the last slot are the least played. Of course we will keep an eye on this and keep adjusting and improving!
---
Isnt every Frank like this? Just spamming(not in front of a super Shelly) supers
---
Exactly, if you have 14k trophies with 20 brawlers then thats good

Bruuuuh are you talking about 8bit classic so many people have him
---
22 out of 28 brawlers shown (feels bad for darryl)
---
OK. It is difficult to kill the brawler that have very high speed, unless they are stupid. Top players can dodge bullets, and in my opinion it is not so OP
---
Upvoted for the effort
---
(571+575+569)/3 = 571.7

(568+571+580)/3 = 573

---
It does look weird when it looks like the projectiles go through the target. I tested Darryl and a few other brawlers and Darryl seemed to be the worst in this area. And when I say worst, I mean the animation appearing to hit the brawler.
---
I don't know what SC should do. I think if you were to increase the size of the projectile hit box, that has problems. You would be hitting 2 projectiles on most auto aimed shots that are shot near max range. This also makes it easier to hit more projectiles the closer you are. This could make Rolling Reload very OP. Wait, maybe that's not bad... 🤔
---
You could increase the number of projectiles to 5 and reduce projectile damage so the middle projectile can hit on an auto aimed shot. 
---
You could reduce the size of the projectile animation but then it might be hard to see.
---
Secret option D is do nothing and make players aim shots when poking.
---
Po-cho? Its po-co
---
Yo what is up with that box???

Had this happen in my clan on Clash Royale. Built it up for over a year, loads of really active people who all knew each other. Some guy stuck around for a while, eventually got promoted, then proceeded to boot everyone beneath him after a petty argument with someone in the clan.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Supercell did get back to me advising there wasn't anything they could do unfortunately. Being a dick isn't against their rules, but it did teach me to be a lot more careful with who gets promoted in future.

Its an edit

Almost 16.5k and no legendary ;(

Thats so sad bro ... Hope youll get something soon:/.
---
While that would be broken, consider 2 facts.
---
1. Killing a carl during his super would be hard, due to the fact that 8 bit is slow, and is a sharpshooter. Would also be hard to find a carl during his super.
---
2. Any stunned or slowed enemy would give 8 bit debuffs. This more or less makes this star power worse than any of his current ones.
---
Well say good bye to your crow supercell support won't respond anytime soon
---
buisines is buinises
---
It’s supposed to be ironic. You can see entire meme subreddits focused on this and this isn’t even as stupid as the things on those subreddits.
---
Hmmm. If this were me. I got 17k trophies and 28/28 brawlers. Mm is normal. I’m never 1 gem short for anything and I don’t buy gems. If an update comes out I don’t post. Now let’s talk about you. You got 4K trophies and you’re a complete noob. Mm doesn’t suck you suck and you blame mm. You spend your gems the day you get them and never have any left over. None of the posts about the updates can come close to how bad this post is. What you think of them apples biatch?

Anyone notice that GB must be played with both hands ?

the more life disappoints

4000 health can return 200 damage

5% should be much much much more

You need to change brawler first. Or use a max brawler when entering practice.

when you lag even in gameboy XD

Apparently!! 😂

i was at 850 with piper and dropped to 680 with randoms...i love that matchmaking when u get teamed up with people 100 trophies below u :)
---
Hey congratulations its a celebretion.This thing isn't true beacuze you stole it  from a pro player.Yes you did it very nice,and all it took!30 second to copy it and 30 second to repost it too.Now you are at number one,hope you did nothing wrong by copying this photo from the pro player called Tom.You think we wouldn't see!It's right there on the top right,but since you are poopoohead you don't care about this stuffs.
---
It's a bug.
---
Done
---
I miss the beta days
---
Only brawler I can mostly recognize is Colt, if it is colt
---
Check the linked post 2 months ago, this guy noticed it recently and gets upvotes but everyone knew this already since Tick was released
---
Omg nice congrats...how long did it take? And u have gold mecha bo...so nice bro! :)
---
I did
---
I should put Ctrl+C, I done a mistake
---
That a skin. Not a recolor
---
I will never forgive this sub for ruining the funniest thing ive seen on this sub.
---
That copypasta was brillient but everybody killed it by commenting it on every dam art piece
---
too relatable
---
Yes,40£ isn't something but you see, I live in Turkey and 1£ is about 7 TL(Turkish Lira) and the people here don't tend to get around 10k TLs a month. They only get around 2k TL(unless you're a doctor(doctors get too much money here)) which is about 285£ just a month. The bills, food and drinks and etc already take a lot. 280 TLs is just too much to spare just for entertainment.
---
So to you, it may seem like little money but for me it's just a lot.
---
I have seen ur posts. Im with you, be strong! Brawl stars team will help you 💪 Please tell me anything that u want me to do about this. I can feel how sad you are. That is a big account. I will always help you!
---
Thank you boi
---
but gene's new SP is useful in solo
---
Don't use Reddit to self-promote your YouTube account
---
Good star power, should be higher to actually be impactful: a maxed Colt will deal 2520 if he hits all six shots, and would be receiving only 126, which is close to nothing. Considering his other star powers, I'd say 20% would be better, because colt would take 504 damage. I don't think it's too much, because you're not supposed to get hit anyways, but it would help stop whoever is attacking you. Also, spike having  3360 means that the max damage that he could do in one life with the sp would be 672, which isn't much but it's not worthless
---
That's an english sub! Die idee ist gut solange man nicht um geld spielt...ich kenn viele gute spieler die unter 16 sind...
---
That's a really sick mode! I think adding difficulties to the zombies would be awesome like:
---
Starter: Level 5 zombies
---
Normal: Level 6 zombies
---
Advanced: Level 8 zombies
---
Challenging: Level 9 zombies
---
Annoying: Level 10 (meaning star powers)
---
Incomprehensible: Harder bots of Level 10,for example Poco zombies will have Screeching Solo etc. 
---
(I hope you like my idea UwU)
---
Oof nice
---
Where's proof of him noticing,which link?I am really interested
---
Found it out very soon...was just a little bug i guess
---
Guys,he is a troll,just downvote his post and go away,don't even post it on any subreddit
---
A
---
WHY DOES THIS ALWAYS MATTER
---
Bull with Band-Aid? Oh gosh...
---
So he was surprised about it.
---
i miss her old eyebrows as well
---
While I agree that it's not great in most game modes, but it is completely OP in solo showdown. Already played 5 games with this star power and it took me from a losing trophies rank to rank 1-5 in each game. And my 8 bit is currently at 617 trophies so it's not like I'm playing at low levels either.
---
You have to think about it. Not everyone has power 9 brawlers. Most of mine are power 7, but a I have a lot of powerup points on all of them, and if I had the coins, they would be level 9. To get them maxed out would take way more than just 3000 coins. Reaching 13k is prestigious, and you should be rewarded more for that.
---
Credits?
---
Yeess
---
Help me i have ray gun!!!

You don't see the link? Well link again

This post its about a guy noticing Tick's bombs face 2 months ago, but the guy in this post discovers it "recently" and gets cheap upvotes
---
Maybe, but 300 is definitely not sufficient for 13k trophies.
---
i think there's a leaked third star power for spike: when spike falls below 40% he starts shooting spikes everywhere that deal damage to enemies
---
*YES*
---
Top comment
---
Brock needs another skin...
---
Proof of him noticing?I mean he could have just discovered it by accident,I am not supporting his side but I want to know if he did
---
The zombies do poison damage!
---
Earrape tho
---
Bo poco.
---
Exactly. They trust him because high cups. But he’s a troll and just kicks everyone.
---
10/10 would shake again
---
Precisely :)
---
You are stupid man
---
This would be awesome for any jumper or someone who can move over water with their super
---
Yeah... he kicked over 50 members from my clan. That’s the issue
---
I know it is just soo long and either way too easy or way too hard
---
well yes but actually no
---
I gotchu 💯
---
Yeah proper for when you get 2000, you will never see them again
---
This is true. I should cross post lol
---
If mortis gets a buff he will be the most OP brawler in the game so on my mortis rank and higher the sd games will be of 10 mortises...
---
If u want Mortis to kill u all the time than a buff is what u need
---
Idk what buff do u want except Coiled Snake back to 100%, he right now is one of the most OP brawlers and very easy to get to good ranks.
---
I saw a level 1 8-BIT with 700+ trophies
---
#fax
---
I tried to make it sound like it came out of the Gameboy. I may have used too much high-frequency boost.
---
I only have the extra life one...not sure if the other star power is any good or not yet.
---
I feel that the extra life star power is more useful out of the two.
---
gene was my first mythic aswell, back when i had 2400. my legendary chance (before gene) was 0.1208%. i could have gotten a legendary, but no, supercell felt that they should give me a mythic.
---
r/beatmetoit
---
Jesus...that's some hardcore brawlstar right there.
---
Yeah I remember him being op in brawl ball, and he used to fit into every single team comp.
---
no shelly is super
---
Amazing 😍 im setting this as my wallpaper since Shelly is my no.1 brawler
---
Copy n paste well now I can tell why Frank is your flair tho
---
Oh yeah, this is really low
---
Those are there on purpose to add to the stupidity of the joke. The meme is in the perspective of an idiot posting about something they think they know about even though they don't. You seem to be in that perspective too. Go soak you're fat head.
---
Yeah, my legendary drop % is 0.2160% right now. And I can tell I'm going to get a mythic and make it drop like hell.
---
So does penny
---
Also him just running away from robots for 13 min 14 sec
---
*cries in no coiled snake*
---
Omg omg r/emojipolice
---
Nice! I’m always scared to use Mortis on BB cause I’ll fail this, 😂
---
*laughs in coiled snake and creepy harvest*
---
No no no, there was a replay. It just goes to a different school.
---
*cries in power 4 mortis*
---
It’s in his recent posts but this is better
---
Same. Imma buy Dumpling Daryll and Lion Dance Brock
---
I got coiled snake 3 days after it was released and Creepy Harvest 5 hours after getting coiled snake lol
---
Alright come up with a skin idea and draw it that fits with the theme of the moon festival
---
Yeah, I just used the trick now a bunch and it works most of the time.
---
So that’s why you want his buff... power 8 and higher is rly OP
---
Seems leg😏🙃😂
---
Actually I got mortis at 7.4k and primos star power in the same box
---
I read it in Club chat and wanted to see what you were talking about 👍🏼
---
More hp?
---
I think this would only make Showdown more frustrating. Some spawns are better than others and because of how Jump Pads work, some can force you to jump into a Brawler you dont want to because you either didnt expect them to be there or an unfavourable matchup spawned closer to you, forcing you to take that route. The amount of water also makes it much harder to navigate the map and some "islands" cant be reached unless Brawlers like Dynamike (with Dynajump) or Brawlers that can fly try to get there.
---
Lol a lucky box
---
I got tara at 900 trophies and Mortis on 1200 the same day after pushing Tara
---
1200+ damage and many Hp
---
Mk, im newbie to reddit so
---
Idk maybe reload speed?
---
Ja auch ohne Geld ist es gut aber irgendwie ein signirung oder irgend ein speciel Zeichen im Namen wäre super damit die Leute sehen derjenige hat gewonnen👑👑👑
---
I see that
---
Does me at 9k with no mythical but my sister with 500 count
---
Why did you post 6 times
---
You have Leon HOW
---
*toxic*
---
When did u get leon?
---
I got my first mythic(gene) at 6k and still no tara at 11.5k
---
Magic
---
Food
---
I got lucky at 4.3k 1 month after his release
---
https://youtu.be/_elD6xWklok :) Working really hard! Support is appreciated :) 💟

Supercell isn't great at balancing so let's hope it gets better next balance update.

I know its called a woooosh, and i reacted like This on purpose so i could get wooshed but because i did it on purpose i actually wooooshed the woooosher 
---

Its the old Piper icon
---
I think one of rosas star powers should guve her this effect when she supers
---
U didn’t
---
It’d be funny if he was actually referring to you lol
---
If i were to guess probably the desert still dunno
---
14.5k r/nolegendarygang
---
Doesn’t that kind of defeat the purpose of staying hidden though?

Does someone want to join my clan too? It’s called coman. Mayonesa (the club is Spanish but we know to talk English perfectly)

ANNIE FROM LEAGUE OF LEGENDS!!
---
I ain't shaking. Just coughing.
---
Man has best skin
---
I think any bench mark that gives u coins should be buffed.
---
If u hit 10.5k u should get 500 coins instead of 150 (or atleast 300) and for reaching the next thousand benchmark (11k) u should get 3k like u said. Or 2k.
---
My bet is it's someone you know.
---
That's lucky I hate you people only one mythic I'm at 11k and no mythics or legendarys
---
Or gems....
---
Bruh its a gameboy classic

## bruh 💀💀💀💀💀

Really? Do u really think that i'm stupid and don't see that he repost every sh*t he sees? Do u ever heard something of a thing called sarcasm? I think not...

Like I said to the other guy. Top 200 in U.S starts at 775 and I'm now at 625. Not super far off.
---
This looks real, nice job on the Photoshop
---
In my contry its night i will check the map next day and create the final version of the map
---
I got crow yesterday and is hard af pushing him up, especially when he's still power 1  😩
---
Stupid shelly...XD
---
For me it looks like its not 28 brawlers, noooooo this art is soo good that... that... iii just cant belive it. Looks like its 128. Great job and just continue ;D
---
What are u talking about?
---
Well it's close to midnight for me as well...
---
She should have a loli face
---
why?
---
But he’s a male not a female making him a female will ruin the game for me because I like colt the way he is
---
I have 21/28, have 8.2k trophies, and havent gotten a new brawler from a brawl box since carl came out. yay
---
I am shaking~
---
Well I made a post earlier today of me killing all 9 other players in solo showdown, this was boring to watch
---
This is better than the one with band aid
---
all of them since I bought leon and spike
---
Nobody deserves to die.
---
Thanks for pointing this out!
---
Yup this has happened to as well. Created a club with my co workers when this game first came out o n global. Always had a maxed out club and I promoted someone who was active and vocal in the clan to VP. Kicked everyone next week.
---
Lesson learned. Never gonna forget. Ethan19.
---
I enjoy alpharad
---
It indeed is a sensible idea and it does looks like it you have put some serious efforts on it and it is gonna make anyone sad to see their post get downvotes and thats obvious. But it might be that the people who downvoted thought a little bit more critically? Like the idle disconnect thingy when you don't move for few moment? Or that the star power isn't going to make any sense in any mode other than showdown or perhaps a little bit? But you get the point, I hope. Although I do agree with you that the downvoters could work it out in the comment section but again, the downvote option is their for a reason. Please don't think that I am just hating or being jealous its not like that at all its just that I have OCD and I can't stand anything that doesn't perfectly fit or make sense
---
Imagine having the time to do that. I don't have time to pull shit like that let alone play the actual game.
---
you are below 6k and missing 5 brawlers!! stop complaining about this, there are worse
---
This is the worst map I ever seen         sorry
---
#I do too.
---
I might be shaking again...
---
How the heck did you find the time to go start a screen capture? 
---
I always want to do this when I get on Brawl TV but have never been able to :)
---
Also, RIP- sorry!
---
That's a great idea.
---
Username checks out.

lmao imagine the top 1 club if it happens this

why u make her so hot. OmO OwO

yeah, seen a lot of your posts there great. keep up the great work

the're
---
I saw a square of four in the top-right for the first time, too.
---
Box gods are feeling generous, I guess?
---
Matching does suck, posts about it r fine.  Post complaining about complaints is just hypocritical.
---
It’s good
---
But it doesn’t feel like a Jessie that would be in Brawl Stars
---
Oh lol who is he
---
Yeah lol
---
Thanks haha
---
She too hot
---
This means if spike dies the enemy takes about 200 damage.....
---
Needs to be a higher return percentage like 15%ish
---
Only mortis would say this as he has the same sharp tip.
---
Ikr..very unexpected
---
How about anyone touched by Spike starts bleeding for 3 minutes losing 1000 each second.
---
Thank you soooo much

Thx 😁👌
