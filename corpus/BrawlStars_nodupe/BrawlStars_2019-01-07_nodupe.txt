Thats how mafia works

Maybe she can deal damage in health %, I've never seen something like that in a game. Obviously there are many ways you could go with this concept, such as dealing 60% of the enemies remaining health plus like 400 extra damage, the more you hit an enemy the less damage you will do, (unless they regency their health) making her more of a support weakening the enemies and allowing her teammates to pick up the kills, if this was the case I think she should have a really low reload speed. But the main idea is that she deal % damage the rest of the factors affecting it can be changed.

can I take the second image and change it please cuz I imagine so much meme with that image x)
---
Shotgunnes become a lot less common because of teamers, however you can still find them on some maps
---
It's based on brawler trophies
---
Nah man, only OG's remember turret and bear hp decay.
---
He balanced to me
---
I know just saying this is dumb.
---
Pam is broken. Also really getting tired of seeing half the players as bull and el primo in every single showdown match. 
---
Penny‚Äôs turret is op, and Rico is ok but not versatile
---
Straight facts. The game has changed so much since day 1 
---
Penny doesn‚Äôt need a buff, are you crazy?
---
Ya same here 
---
and?
---
Wish he wasn't cringy as hell, because there are not a lot of brawl stars channels on youtube.
---
penny can't hit anyone with her turret. you can ignore it and you still wont get hit.
---
I laughed so it was enough effort for me. Dumb bot
---
Yep üëç
---
How do you even run? I find it so hard.
---
If you stop or try to backtrack it fucks you over

Youre right you just have to spend a lot of money on the game till you all get the legendaries and use a sqaud of op legendaries...hm. ya not a top player just being cheap
---
it can also be easily destroyed, and has a very slow fire rate, and has to target 3 different people at once.
---

---
It‚Äôs my first time, I have the right to be proud of my accomplishment
---
Not neccesarely. When you use your super to create a mirror clone, you need a way to be able to swap with your clone, even if it's just once. So whenever your Super (clone) is active, you can re-press the button (without recharging) to swap, just once, with your clone. 
---
So it could either be that the Super recharges after your clone is gone again or after you swapped with your clone, once. 
---
Bullshit
---
Eh I don't feel the whole Leon thing yet..granted I'm not playong on high level but he's not scaring me in bounty for at all..Brock and Piper are real problems there. 
---
Nah pins were better
---
Ye it happened to me too. Was playing showdown. Finished it, so I start a new one. But the game takes too long. So I close the app and enter. Press play. Realize I was automatically put to gem grab. Press exit. Nothing. But the game is loading again for too long, so I think to myself I can close and reopen it again. When I come back, I press on showdown, this time wait patiently, and I finally get put in a showdown match. Not even 20 seconds in, that the game loads, and I find myself in a gem grab match. I hopefully won that. But obviously, I lost the showdown
---
Definitely Morris range lol
---
You can roll out but usually it spits you through one of the walls in the corners stranger things style. Getting actually stuck is a bug (I hope I'm not just repeating something super obvious)
---
o ya, that was a pain. But do you remember bull‚Äôs old voice when he charges?
---
I rarely have problems its probably just your connection
---
Dude you see 2 Times 666, there are 2 Tickets claimed, so 666/2 = 333. just do the math

That makes sence tho...like someone riding a horse...but yeah you right...

Have you seen anything on the brawl stars r34? Ive been looking for things

---
I use solo show down and 3v3 game modes when I have solid teammates on my team then I use discord so I can have communication with my teammates. 
---
Seriously
---
Depends on what characters, maps, game modes, and trophies at the start and middle of the game you'll find a lot of mirror matches
---
This is great you're putting two of my favorite things together Rick and Morty and brawl Stars
---
Just because you have high trophies doesn‚Äôt mean the game owes you a legendary or any cards at all 
---
I like Mortis. I think he is one of the most funny brawlers to play with. Even though, he still not that strong and you need to have a really HIGH skill to play with him.
---
Wow that‚Äôs awesome! Such a smooth flow!
---
I got Leon from a brawl box at 500 trophies. I‚Äôm unlucky too man.
---
Tier list for this Tier list:
---
F
---
You must not talk to anyone then, everyone I know thinks Leon needs a nerf.
---
Why is Mortis in both tiers, does his hat make him funnier?
---
Leon shouldn‚Äôt even be seen
---
That‚Äôs because he‚Äôs holding his pick. But still clever lmao!
---
I disagree rico is just a worst colt imo
---
You‚Äôre an idiot
---

4500 here, Trophy Road Brawlers only. Guy in my Band is at 1300 with Spike. What the hell.
---
Bull going for the kamikaze 
---
Don't recommend personally 
---
Weekly needs to be like get 35 wins or like get 100 kills
---
I agree with daily 
---
Permanent get 100 wins no set time gives you a brawler guaranteed 
---
Thanks!
---
Nope. The ricochet of the bullets is great for close quarters maps. The super is way better too
---
Haha yep
---
U don‚Äôt need to use his super tho. His dps is op asf.
---
i am agree with you
---
Well I bought a 5 dollar pack with a mega box but I see what ur saying
---
I think the meme goes from the bottom to the top
---
I think they could do something to crow like they did with Darryl in how he regenerates his super over time without having to hit anyone. If they can find a balanced regen rate for crow I think he could be a very good but balanced assassin in the game.
---
Yeah but mirroring it is too much work for me.
---
Rigor-Mortis
---
Piper the SNIPER
---
Clash royale does because they seem to introduce a new card every other month. then they need to fix it because it's way to strong and is comically unbalanced 
---
nerf le√≥n now 
---
Sure
---
I gave him a hairnet instead of a chef hat sorry
---
How do you even enter the qualifiers ? I could hold my ground. Lead of my clan
---
Brasileiros emponderados no reddit
---
I like it but what if the super was to reflect the next 3 projectiles back to where they came from.
---
Ex,: Bull comes out of bushes, you activate super, he shoots 3 times and since he is point-blank, he kills him self.
---
I feel like piper is good where she is as a higher skill cap brawler
---
CoPiEd FrOm Me
---
i just said he couldn‚Äôt even get close to any of them ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  which means his dps from far sucks
---
How much do legendary cost and what is the cheapest you think they will go 
---
Didn't leon already get nerfed? 
---
His dps from max range is still really good
---
Lol
---
This basically describes me in brawl Stars the other day I got Leon from a big box and I was only at 786 trophies
---
actually brock shoots rockets out his mouth since his ‚Äúrpg‚Äù is just a fidget cube
---
Sorry but supercell doesn‚Äôt buff brawlers with the intent of making them better or worse in showdown bc it‚Äôs not a competitive game mode
---
200-300 dmg per shot is really bad, and most of the time from far you‚Äôll only get 1-2 shots on target from that far away, poco or colt would rek you especially since those guys are really good players
---
Nah Tara‚Äôs super is too op for that 
---
I'm at 4.2k and I don't have Mythics, Legendaries, and Epics (except Piper. I bought her with Gems).
---
I've opened atleast 5 mega boxes and collected every star token except a few. This luck factor thing is extremely vague. 
---
Ok stop trying to argue leon is bad. Just strafe left so all his shots r in a line. Even if u did beat them without leon, there‚Äôs no point of posting it on reddit
---
thank you actually. If you haven‚Äôt started this meta, I wouldn‚Äôt have made this post and wouldn‚Äôt got fricken 1k+ upvotes. LoL.
---
Btw, I saw you playing at Lex‚Äôs live earlier...you did pretty well!
---
Legendaries in the shop can vary, it can be on sale for 470 gems, and when it‚Äôs not on sale it‚Äôs 700 gems, so about $30-$50 
---
^
---
Every brawler has a somewhat creative name and then there's just Crow. 
---
Why you deleted this please tell me
---
Can I downvote you out of jealousy
---
Cool thanks 
---
Lmao

---
These tier lists are getting more and more stupid, but alright who gives a damn these are fucking entertaining!
---
Wanna know some spoilers?
---
Next week on Wednesday the Dynamike chef skin will be released, based on the fact that they always release new things on Wednesdays and the two datamined skins weren't released together
---
The week after the new showdown map will be released, also on Wednesday. The map could protentially swap spot with the Dynamike skin, being released a week earlier, but it's more likely it'll be the two skins first.
---
Three weeks later on January 23th, there will be a balance change and maybe a new update. In the balance change I believe Leon will be heavily nerfed while spike and pam receives small nerf, and Primo receives small buff and Mortis receives a bigger buff, perhaps even a rework. In the same patch the Robo rumble and Boss Fight exploits will be patched, sad because I spent alot of time and tickets finding the exploit. 
---
Thats all my predictions, hopefully I get some of them right but then when do I ever get what I want
---
Yeah!
---
Hmm your analysis on piper is backed by science and statistics I assume, correct?
---
ik, but were you already recording it?
---
How did you do that 
---
Unless I can see some statistics about bull play rate dropping at lets say 10k trophies, it‚Äôs very hard to believe you. Regardless, most players fall between 1-5000 trophies, as seen by player base. 
---
Anyways, the goal of this post was to stop having the game pair 4+ of the same brawler in one solo showdown. 
---
If you have a problem with that I wish you well and have fun arguing with yourself, no hate!
---
Great job!
---
And the hat
---
Never would have thought to see brawl stars and NFL mixed together in a memeüòÇ
---
Yes
---
I'm a beta player with none :(
---
what the...
---
Thank you
---
Mortis has the highest skill cap in the game out of all brawlers so it only makes sense that veteran players think he‚Äôs balanced. Because of his unique mechanic, new players simply don‚Äôt know how to use him properly yet. He takes tons of time to learn how to use, but once you get good with him, pushing him to 500 with your friends will be a breeze. 
---
Oh I didn't notice the hairnet lol
---
Most of the time that bottom right deal is the amount of coins you have when the shop offer pops up, unless you have over a certain amount
---
And how do you have this enough space haha
---
Oh shit, what is your drop chance?
---
Exactly a bull wants to team with me then they he wants to get close to me I‚Äôm a barely yeah because I want to get close enough from you where you can 1 shot me
---
I just delete vids if I don‚Äôt need them :)
---
I pulled mortis from a brawl box like 20 minutes ago lol
---
wait.. is it loading or am I being pranked
---
I am confused as to how the star power(the unlockable power) would work
---
Does it teleport your teammates with you when you use your super or something else like tara‚Äôs star power?
---
Rip your karma, I don't even know why you got downvoted complimenting kairos
---
Me, he took my exploit and gave someone else credit
---
just what I was going to say, the new Mona Lisa
---
Even then, he's not balanced if he's only good in brawl ball and a few maps. In fact, I'd prefer if he was reworked to be useful in other gamemodes, even if it means nerfing his usefulness in bb
---
 I'm already 10K and I really don't learn anything, but watches his videos anyway just to make sure I know everything inside of them already
---
top 10 rappers u/oof-ouch was too afraid to diss
---
Counterpoint: the only people that think he doesn‚Äôt need a nerf only say that because they want to keep running him
---
They are the real ones, just ignore the other ones
---
Your chances goes up when you open boxes so when you have every brawler except legendary you can‚Äôt unlock brawlers you already have so your chances keep going up until you get a legendary but your chances go up for every rarity 
---
It is the only one he can afford
---
Every two games I lag really bad
---
6 min 44 sec as dynamike a really long time ago and for some reason they were playing really bad

good idea !

I have experienced this, quite often actually. Oftentimes for me, it‚Äôs when I have two or more new events available at the same time, and I get 20 for each. I‚Äôm definitely not complaining :)
---
How to gain trophies without being a bush camper 
---
Try to switch up the brawlers you use often. If a certain brawler is good on a map, don‚Äôt try to force a brawler that might not be, like using tanks on open maps, or snipers in maps with lots of cover. Sometimes (at least for me) learning new strategies and what each brawler does helps me learn what other brawlers do, and what maps are good with what team compositions.
---
His hat makes him THE meme.
---
Below your comment
---
25 is starting to be normal for me. Once I got up to the max of 29 and we continued playing for like 2-3 mins on that match I almost got tired of gem grab then
---
No you steal content 
---
What brawlers do you have? Many brawlers are good in certain game modes/maps, so be sure to save them for when those certain events happen.
---
If I like this sub dont go negative? Tf, you on some funny shit rn bruh. The post is so stupid like every one should know that, in order for a game to be challenging and fun you have to have progression, like the (dumbass) had in her post. It's not negative, it's big fax
---
Ur gonna lose hard. Your less than 30% health in a minute
---
You get tokens, and if you have a lot of tickets, these events are good ways to farm lots of brawl boxes 
---
Rip budderman‚Äôs trophies. He was brave enough to sacrifice them to try out the glitch.
---
Ok, first thing: don't autoaim. Yeah, I know it is amazing for shotgunners, but it isn't that good with ranged brawlers. The reason you get Shelly as first brawler and Bull at low trophies is because they are easy to use, only autoaim and that's it.
---
For other brawlers, autoaim won't work, because when the bullets land where they went, the enemy already moved. You have to learn to predict where your enemy will move, so your attack will hit him. You can see it clearly with Colt
---
Remember to play ALL your brawlers, because it helps you to get more skill and practice, while improving your matchmaking
---
Not all brawlers are good at all maps and modes. For example, Bull is trash at Double Trouble un Showdown, or open maps. Choose the best brawlers for each mode and map
---
Happened to me as well, was pretty nice
---
Lol i did it in friendly matchesüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Shelly, Nita, Coly, Barley, Brock, Jessie, Bull, Penny, Poco
---
Well it's just an idea. That buff would make crow a more viable choice everywhere anyway.
---
ok
---
I'll make sure to use that information, thanks!
---
they do the same thing in clash royale, idk why
---
Understandable 
---
Best bang for your buck are robo rumble events. Not the current event basically.
---
For real it's a OP cheapshot anytime she lands a hit
---
Is Mortis still legal?
---
I would have saved it for a deal. Some deals have amazing value.
---
Yeah teaming starts to get worse. Don't only play showdown, otherwise you will see more teamers. (It isn't as bad as it used to be, there used to be a lot more teaming)
---

Congrats dude! I gotta warn you though that you may receive some hate on this post. This upsets people sometimes for whatever reason.

I get this stuff all the time, makes me think it‚Äôs bots
---
Buff rico lol
---
Stick to the bushes. You‚Äôll find that you do really low damage at longer range, so mostly hide and target non-tanks. Once you get your super, I like to wait for all three shots to reload to basically instant kill anyone trapped in it. 
---
Ive never seen one
---
Yo its perfect

So basically, you got NOTHING from opening 70 boxes of nothingness. I can't see anything in this picture. Reported for low effort.

Option 1: Backstabbing. Team, but then kill them quickly.
---
Option 2: Shoot at them. Gets to the point.
---
Option 3: Ignore them. You don't waste anything by doing it, and they waste time trying to team.
---
Option 4: The shimmy. Move your movement joystick left and right, this is supposed to simulate a shaking head saying no. However, people mistake this for spinning sometimes.
---
I've seen a lot of wonky health values for character concepts, so I compiled all the reasonable health values to use. The level increments list how much the health increases after each upgrade. Brawl Star's system has them increase by numbers that end in a zero, so there aren't any messy numbers for your health.
---
Fucking losers lmao
---
Don‚Äôt repost buddy
---
At least some health or damage yep
---
You are a bold one
---
No teaming lol
---
I have all the brawlers and I feel like I‚Äôve been waiting weeks to get this legendary 
---
Too complicated to add in the game. Also penny's mortar is already good.

and his name is poco....

I‚Äôm dying in anticipation

dude you‚Äôre literally advertising this on the brawl stars reddit we have all the memes here
---
Is not that much damage but its honest damage
---
Omg all those bulls and shellys
---
Brawl stars focuses on a fast matchmaking, not a good one.
---
I don‚Äôt think they appear in shop cause I‚Äôve been playing for over a year and only have one legendary and never saw one in the shop
---
Well that‚Äôs depressing 
---
facts 
---
Connect your supercell ID to get the skin 
---
I understand that. But the title concerns fairness. Entering the match, the playing field was mostly equal. You could have each team switch devices, and the better team would still have won. If I have a 3 point contest against Steph Curry, and all the rules are the same for both attempts, that‚Äôs fair. He‚Äôs gonna mop the floor with me. Still fair.
---
What?
---
These needs to be an event but not permenant like gem grab.
---
They give sneak peaks
---
oh lmaoooo
---
Best skin ever
---
Better BULL-ieve it 
---
He doesn‚Äôt need a buff to help unskilled players, just a nerf to auto aim. He‚Äôs balanced either way rn
---
I wish
---
Ok , thanks!
---
No problemo 
---
Yup
---
What do you mean?
---
I think it's a better idea to disable invites rather than show yourself offline.
---
Forgetting you're offline is worst than forgetting your invites are off to me
---
I havent even been it once...rip
---
no
---
The only brawler who needs a buff is leon, bull's and brock
---
Feels bad man you got the worst legendary..
---
To be honest though he has the best voice acting of any brawler in the game
---
"Don't mess with my crew"
---
Also you can break through those walls with bull and be at their safe pretty quickly 
---
Well you kinda deserved that because u were playing Bull but its island invasion so...
---
Beautiful but I think in the narrow part at the where the smaller brawlers go through should either have more rads or no grass at all
---
Nope. The game is too fast and casual, and got a toxic community. They won't do something like that

I also take Latin, mors is third declension, meaning the genitive ends in -is. the plural dative or ablative would be mortibus.

---
DOOOE SO TRUUUUUUUUE
---
Lol i jus had a match and our dude had 21 gems we all turret en up machine gun morter us just defending like mad lol
---
No that would Be a nerf
---
Not me but like 75% of the game identifies as corner bull or primo 
---
I believe shes the feminine ghost buster
---
Ur a real player
---
Aren‚Äôt those the teeth from the bear hat?
---
Seems like a good map but the middle is a great place for el primo to get stuck, colt can blast across, and penny‚Äôs turret and snipe the other safe, but seems good toherwise
---
WHERE IS THE BATTLE LOG AT THO?!? 
---
A good Dynamike can.
---
Probably if you're cornered or if there is another brawler. Or if there's an objective such as Gem Grab then yes
---
Because you're max.
---
Incredible! OMG! What an epic match! /s

I bet you don‚Äôt have it.

I guess I can get on board with this
---
Ofc it‚Äôs based off the base value of a coin üôÑ tf else would they do
---
It's 1000 tokens for 50 gems in shop for me. Hm.. let's see what some people think!
---
You spelled design wting 
---
You spelled design wrong 
---
The gems and walls are randomized it looks like
---
If you'll go with mirror concept, i suggest the super to be like this; mirror all brawlers in the area(mirrored brawlers move to right and orig brawlers to left just like in clash royale haha, while mirroring all brawlers including teammates are unable to move giving you enough time to setup your attacks) 
---
Attack would be; shoot a mirror blade in a direction, while another mirror blade is shot to your opposite direction. The normal mirror has longer range but deals less damage and the mirrored attack has shorter range but has great damage
---
Engrish
---
Premiere pro!
---
Oh ok
---
Yeah, that my bad... its 1000
---
I‚Äôd go for token doubler
---
Highest\*
---
No (but if you need a small amount of pp to upgrade, buy)
---
I identify as a B A R R E L
---
What it felt like when the game was still portrait
---
Weird flex but ok
---
(Anyway nice video)
---
Thanks a lot! 
---
Depends, yes, yes
---
Damn the Chinese even team in Brawlstars
---
You‚Äôre very right, I got carried away upgrading most of my brawlers I barely even use... dunno. 
---
2nd super idea: creates a mirrored clone. Same health same damage. But always moves and shoots opposite of your direction
---
He‚Äôs broken. 
---
I know
---
Also have this offer, I‚Äôll probably pass on it
---
Love the remix. Just wanted to give a suggestion. I feel like the song right now doesn‚Äôt really have dynamic contrast. Maybe a base drop starting from 0:45 and dropping on 1:00 would make it sound more exciting.
---
What are some of the brawlers that have good star powers?
---
I agreee
---
How do u donate gems???

---
No, my friend gave me free gift cards.
---
I didn't know about this game till the day before yesterday. Stop bullying
---
Oh... so that‚Äôs not really free to play... even though u didn‚Äôt spend money I think that counts as not f2p
---
Had you been grinding GG for a while?
---
Ok
---
Im at 0.2734 ! Without any legendary.  
---
Got 19/22 at 9k6 (everyone at 500+)  
---
Playing since the first week of the first beta.
---
Lol trophies? I got 7k and got spike and crow out of the free mega box just grind 
---
No it‚Äôs not look on the global leader boards 
---
Well since the game is not that old you are not older now
---
r/prequelmemes
---
I have a question, the rule specifically says that if I want to recruit for my club or join a club, I have to post in r/BrawlRecruit, but I am not trying to recruit or join a club in this post.
---
There shouldn‚Äôt be a rank for only 1 person on only 1 brawler at only a certain time during the season is what I‚Äôm trying to say...
---
9k6. 19/22 Everyone at 500+.  
---
So frustrating to see thoses noobs at 3k get legendary... Just give me one will pull it to 500 within a week ...
---
If it was impossible, which technically it isnt, you just need to grind and get lucky, it wouldn‚Äôt be physically impossible. The RNG and brawlers arent physical things.
---
Rip nat
---
Cheesy. I cringed so hard. 
---
When everyone crushed me with characters like bull and the crow and all I got that is strong enough is the bear firl
---
It gets worse. My one friend who has like 700 trophies and can barely play the game got Crow. Its one of those situations where you have to pretend to be happy for them and are split between crying and hurting them on the inside
---
Bo needs a rework :v
---
My brother, f2p means not spending a single dime on this game, gift cards are still considered paying to most people. But not knowing this isn‚Äôt a big deal though, just state it on the original post  so people don‚Äôt say that you‚Äôre lying that you‚Äôre f2p.
---
This honestly made my day üòÇ.
---
Bruh... And it's always the one time you forget to check a bush. Heart goes in hyper drive. 
---
They still have a 2 trophy advantage.
---
*liTErAlLy uNPlAyBLe*  
---
Same here lol guess we are the lucky one's 
---
It took 3 people to comment this for me to actually double check and yr right, at least one eye is always closed. She should be one tier down.
---
Yea because so many AVERAGE players can now sit at 11k while its hard for pros to push now because they lose everything eventually
---
It's impossible when you start an account because the brawl boxes are predetermined at the start. But after like 1 week it's just luck. 
---
I agree, this does not seem possible.
---
And they say Leon was hard to get...
---
2. "Usually" so it's just a case I did not got an offer today? TY
---
Auto aim will win
---
I also understand why Supercell wants to keep it, but they said themselves that this isn't what they intend happening. Teams of 2 or 3 smaller brawlers is okay to face a more powerful player/other small teams, but this is absolute no skill bullshit. Funny that while all the mutator gamemodes always work against solo players and not against the huge teams, as they actually were intended.
---
This is where it's going too far.
---
At least 60 tr? =0 How much trophies did you have before?
---
I am 10k throphies Free to play player and i say you that this game is completely f2p 
---
So uh. Who won???
---
If ur in need of gold , yeah it's a good one
---
I just miss tho no auto aim
---
Seasons? This game is not fortnite dude
---
Where is the lie? üòÇ 
---
Maybe you saw it because it was near you. 
---
Not pictured: your gem carrier rushing the other way to stab the Balrog in the shins.
---
Does this happen with other brawlers?
---
I had 440 and went to 501 trophies. I don‚Äôt know why but I can‚Äôt see the picture I pu anymore ! 
---
You can't see  it
---
LMAOü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
Dats my Reaction when i got my First Legendary..
---
Lucky you. Have spent over 100$ and still no Leon. With another 50$ I will just buy him in the shop xD
---
Look at the back of him
---
Well I am a f2p , but sorry to say that I am at 19/22, missing is Tara, Leon, bo. Am at 2.7k , playing from global release
---
or little stars
---
On the thophy road, bottom right, there is the current season expire date. There's a new season every 15 days. Beyond 3000 throphyes u will get some tokens/keys whatever based on how you placed. All details in the trophey road. 
---
Look at my update.
---
This is nothing.... lmao
---
Token doublers if u don‚Äôt have all the power points
---
Their is a bounty map just like that
---
Cool thanks
---
Imo this isn't outsmarting. Good players worked to become good, and have suffered the same I-got-destroyed fate once, before they decided to improve. I've been one of those players on Fortnite (and still am against a part of the players). 
---
Teaming is like trying to 1v2, 1v3 or 1v4 in a duo or squad game. Is it fun? Depends. Getting sprayed to hell isn't, outsmarting is. The problem is that this can't happen in Brawl Stars, especially not with Franks. This is like a Boom Box that is able to deal damage in a 2-tile circle. 
---
In Brawl Stars numbers stand far above skill. This is where's the problem with teaming. Biggest team: (often) biggest win.
---
I hope it gets added. I really love it :D
---
I'm not in need of gold. But gold is something you require a lot of instantly right?
---
So like what if i get this and keep the gold saved? Or i can just buy 1000 tickets? What's better?
---
leveling up bull and players experience give extra coins. 13 levels = 130 keys. Per level 20 keys, since he is new, he gained many levels most likely... plus the keys available every 2h. adds up
---
You know, like the meteor strikes or power boost modes. Those are called event modifiers.
---
Wait I forgot Crow
---
Shit u right! It‚Äôs been so long since I got that 10 coin rank up :p
---
Yep
---
I‚Äôm just going off of youtubers at 13000+ trophies that have said they want that wishlist or similar
---
Holy jesus. Don't say you didn't get it lol
---
If I posted every win I would have over 5300 posts. Please don‚Äôt post pointless stuff like this.
---
Yeah me too. 
---
Hello. I have a suggestion and it‚Äôs like clash royal that has daily quests to make the game more engaging. 
---
I have all my brawlers max on power points. I have 4 lvl 10 brawlers and I‚Äôm missing the legendarys all 3 of them. 8.2k trophies
---
Soy el mejoOOOOoooor
---
Worst game mode by far imo, especially with randoms.. too many times you can be dominating a game and then suddenly your gem carrier dies randomly and enemy team picks them up and runs away for the win.. not fun or engaging gameplay by any means. SD, Heist, Brawl Ball, and Bounty are all significantly more fun than Gem Grab imo. 
---
When Gem Grab takes up 2 of the available game modes it's very painful 
---
There is no legitimate way to change your mind. 
---
What did you get in the mega box?
---
This is an actually awesome idea! I would totally get this skin!
---
leon needs to do less range damage or have less range
---
Didn't open it yet ;)
---
Thats a good deal
---
I hope you get Leon and you can get some easy trophies. :D
---
0.0816
---
Ty man 
---
Didn't realize you were serious and was looking for the joke for a minute
---
And get hate for posting it. Ok I'll take it ;) (joke joke)
---
That‚Äôs a shit Ton if Bi Power points
---
Actually if you want to be anal about it the mean average is 50seconds, I did the math.
---
O ok, I was just asking cause I didn't know
---
where is this from
---
zed 
---
Thicc loliüåö
---
(FBI , OPEN UP!)
---
no her super is like a zed w not old urgot ult
---
old urgot ult was swap with enemy
---
Who‚Äôs hoping for a Leon buff and a mortis nerf?
---
How long have you been playing? I've been playing since global launch and just wondering on average how long I should expect to wait just by opening the regular small and big boxes...
---
At least you Won
---
Pubg is a game that has long rounds, and allows you to meet the people you are playing with. Brawl stars is fast paced and it just wouldn't work,   along with the toxicity among older players having to deal with less experienced players and younger kids. 
---
quik
---
*discord
---
You just need to do 2 things, Spam auto aim and be annoying af
---
Damn, I got 435 and only 2220 trophies, nice work
---
Yeah, misread it, but still that worked for zed because he was an assassin, this brawler is a Sharpshooter this would only work as an escape
---
Now that's probably true.
---
I‚Äôm more interested by your friends name
---
good idea
---
I think it's best compared to the Robo Rumble snipers, but perhaps they could make it so it keeps moving instead of standing still like the snipers xD
---
Oke thanks for the advice :) By maining i meant my brawler with highest trophies. The trophy difference between my highest and lowest is not a lot, so i use most of them regularly :)
---
how many should I be.to get what I needed how level
---
I think the old Brock skin could use a little work, but I still like it better. The new Dynamike is the best though
---
 
---
Basic offer (which does not include any discount): 150 coins / 20 Gems = 7,5 Coins per gem
---
50 Gem offer (which includes a little discount because the more you buy the more thex will give you like in any other game): 400 Coins / 50 gems = 8 Coins per gem
---
Special offer: 800 Coins / 106 gems = 7,54 Coins per gem
---
800 Coins / 59 Gems = **13,55 Coins per gem**
---
Conclusion: You can't compare the Special offer to the 50 gem one since Supercell already gives a discount the bigger the package gets.
---
For the basic Coin per gem number we talk about a .04 difference (6,05 with the Special offer) compared to the basic 20 gem pack
---
Sorry for the bad quality and the fast text, that's my first attempt ever at doing a text gif lol. Hope u guys enjoy it!

---
That is real ‚Äòstunning‚Äô
---
A more simplistic solution: The mirror leaves glass on the floor. Dealing small damage to the one who's standing on top of it! (so if you hit, it deals a little bit more damage, but if you miss it leaves a small puddle of glass)
---
I tried to solve the problem. Thanks for the feedback buddy
---
I disagree with the other comments.  I think you go for the deal, especially if you are trying to push a specific brawler to level 9.  With the doubler you would get 4 additional small boxes, which I highly doubt would provide a total of 105 points (at least from what I've seen).  If by some miracle those 4 boxes did give over 105 points, they all certainly wouldn't be for the specific brawler you want.  I understand you miss out on 4 chances of another brawler but lets be realistic, your not pulling a brawler :)
---
I have the same deal, and I bought it.
---
Level 35. Boss
---
Why, may I ask?
---
FBI open up
---
My point is to not just backstab . But to not team in the first place! Spin and then continue playing like you would play normally without teaming ie keep shooting them .
---
Better!  &lt;3
---
I'm pretty sure it's a straight face
---
Like this       :/
---
No, dumb of you to assume that considering i never said that . 
---
As it should be.
---
Shotgunners are rejected, excpect darryl cuz he is not that dangerous anymore
---
May the first to get his stun win
---
wow
---
Thanks for the advice!

What it feels like to get a legendary that's not Spike or Leon  üò™
---
Leon: Hold my beer
---
Should have started a day earlier...would have gotten a free Shelly skin

Why do you post this on reddit...

White theme... you ruined the whole chain

Lol, just imagine when you get to 500...

Very cool!

Stop Auto-aim

Give us achievements of some kind.......

are you spanish?

focous on one brawler and lev him up to 10.but keep other brawlers consistent too.i recommend unlocking colts star power first and then jessie. so buy the tokens for the brawlers you wanna bring to lev 10. watch kairos time vids to understand better [https://www.youtube.com/redirect?redir\_token=z9jO1K3Gu2eYXrwz8M4UYhocZVZ8MTU0Njk2MTg1NkAxNTQ2ODc1NDU2&amp;event=comments&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoo.gl%2F1qE15w&amp;stzid=UgyZxzthfY-DLqubQtx4AaABAg](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?redir_token=z9jO1K3Gu2eYXrwz8M4UYhocZVZ8MTU0Njk2MTg1NkAxNTQ2ODc1NDU2&amp;event=comments&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoo.gl%2F1qE15w&amp;stzid=UgyZxzthfY-DLqubQtx4AaABAg) and lex [https://www.youtube.com/redirect?v=CGYVp7TxyHs&amp;redir\_token=ixCT55f6e71N8RmHLhukYl6GMlh8MTU0Njk2MTkyMUAxNTQ2ODc1NTIx&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoo.gl%2FfJqkSn&amp;event=video\_description](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?v=CGYVp7TxyHs&amp;redir_token=ixCT55f6e71N8RmHLhukYl6GMlh8MTU0Njk2MTkyMUAxNTQ2ODc1NTIx&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoo.gl%2FfJqkSn&amp;event=video_description) and rey [https://www.youtube.com/redirect?redir\_token=I3V2ZDHiI\_KuXqnavGCfMKqD2tJ8MTU0Njk2MTk4MkAxNTQ2ODc1NTgy&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2QlHPbi&amp;v=LOVAKxm17Ks&amp;event=video\_description](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?redir_token=I3V2ZDHiI_KuXqnavGCfMKqD2tJ8MTU0Njk2MTk4MkAxNTQ2ODc1NTgy&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2QlHPbi&amp;v=LOVAKxm17Ks&amp;event=video_description) and coach cory [https://www.youtube.com/redirect?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoo.gl%2FbejNKL&amp;event=video\_description&amp;v=\_wkY0tT12sM&amp;redir\_token=G\_EkEa8gHpsr7FwTA33SchmY1aF8MTU0Njk2MjA5OUAxNTQ2ODc1Njk5](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoo.gl%2FbejNKL&amp;event=video_description&amp;v=_wkY0tT12sM&amp;redir_token=G_EkEa8gHpsr7FwTA33SchmY1aF8MTU0Njk2MjA5OUAxNTQ2ODc1Njk5)   and other such youtubers.

No. A bot replaces you when you get kicked out, do you think it's better to have a bot in your team or an AFK that can't do anything except dying over and over? 
---
/u/gifreverser
---
Source on that last video? cracked me up
---
Brawl stars is running out of players  
---
rip
---
Lol except those who have high level dynamike throw sudden stops and change directions randomly there isnt a pattern they just slowly work in your dead zone 
---
Penny is awesome on Solo Feast or Famine 
---
Should I upgrade every brawler once I have enough points to do it? Or I should update only the one that I like the most? The power levels are infinite or there is a cap? Thanks! 
---
Um how would brawl ball be playable? Immunity and not being able to shoot means the player can‚Äôt defend for 5 seconds after respawning. Time you can‚Äôt afford in brawl ball, or heist, sometimes even bounty and gem grab.
---
Sorry i didn't know that.I just started playing like 2 weeks ago
---
rip to the players that facecheck bushes, hasn't anyone learned anything from mobas?
---
Where are the modos???? 
---
Dyna is so good 
---
Got crow within a week of playing (since global) and I have to say I love using him. 
---
Thank you soooo much!!! You just replied to a question that I asked above few sec ago 
---
You should upgrade only brawlers you like. There are 9 levels of power (10 is star power (when you get 9 level for an brawler, you can get from box star power))
---
That‚Äôs too much. The point is that you let shelly close to you. I see all you global bull players just getting decimated by a shelly with a Super, and now begging for it to be nerfed. Truth be told, if you can sneak up on shelly before she has a Super up, she‚Äôs toast.
---
I got an idea, post the same meme but mirrored for twice the karma.
---
Still upvoted tho
---
Increase the daggers he throws
---
I agree with /u/donghoon my opinion is that pewdiepie sucks
---
...
---
Can we get an F in chat?
---
As supercell prioritises FAST MM over FAIR MM, matchmaking requirements loosen over time. Trophy GAP, ping, all become looser and looser the longer you have been searching.
---
LAW AND ORDER
---
Don‚Äòt go the dark path of playing bull. 
---
I do not use Reddit frequently :p
---
The thing surprising me here is that this is 400 trophy MM and it should be full of teaming characters.
---
He has different gameplay compared to hide and auto-aim but once you get used to it he can be awesome. 
---
tl;dr: git gud 
---
Who's more thicc, Piper or Shelly?
---
The trick is to spend lots of money, like this player did.
---
Hahahah
---
Pam, not only she‚Äôs extremely deadly at close range, she‚Äôs also decent at long range, not to mention, she‚Äôs more THICC
---
Yeah I posted a stupid meme that took me like 5 minutes to make on here the other day that got over 1k upvotes therefore this deserves like 8k for sure
---
Why are you trying to bullshit me? :( 
---
The title of your post CLEARLY indicates that you wasn't playing the game bf global so you're trying to make me believe that since global you reached 10k?? C'mon bro that's the shittiest lie I've ever seen
---
(Poco heals the 2000 HP brawler in time)
---
All surprisingly low levels compared to trophy count too
---
tickets are much better
---
2 weeks of play, 2k trophies and no legendaries yet but i still have some others to unlock so it's fine :)
---
I am stunned
---
Yeah instead it‚Äôs level 6 franks? I‚Äôd expect a bunch of level 10 bulls or something for feast of famine I there aren‚Äôt going to be teamers 
---
Who is Derril ?
---
What‚Äôs your legy chance?
---
True, I think also every time you don‚Äôt get a brawler the chances of you getting one in the next box go up slightly
---
That would be nice to have.
---
There's a Shelly above me in the bushes who got earthquacked too.
---
the title and i didn't know people are so dumb that they don't even know memes
---
no matter what google translate tells you... I am spanish and Primo means cousin. the discussion ends.

It‚Äôs coming with the new Update.
---
I have eveyone except legendaries
---
A Mac and cardboard can change lives

Love the art!
---
Yea
---
Penny and Crow?
---
God I love my Poco.  Need Poco skins.  KISS Poco? Didgeridoo Poco? So many options that involve face paint and instruments!
---
wtf
---
Ammo cartridge I presume.
---
Doesn't need a buff
---
So much nostalgia 
---
Because you lie does not mean that others do it.And there is something called concern for others, example friends or family who have begun to play. And they no have same chances as you(Beta Max account) My last reply to you.
---
I'm here to upvote because it's not another \[weak\] meme. Thank you for the effort in your post.
---
‚ù§Ô∏è
---
im at 8k trophies and no tara or legendaries
---
Mods, can you please ban this guy?
---
You‚Äôre a loser with no friends 
---
Cause they probably teamed..
---
I am F2P and I got leon and maxed him when the update just dropped out. So no... Sorry
---
I am not saying I was the first, I am saying you aren't the first lmao
---
No
---

I know how you feel! I screamed on the train going home from work today when i got L√©on.
---
A third healer would definitely be welcome and awesome. I love healing classes in most games I play.  Pam and Poco are awesome but don't fill every role like you're getting at here.
---
Poco is your AOE healer, Pam is your stationary siege-healer, and we need a focus-tank healer.  Might be a little difficult with modes only being 3v3 though.  Like if we think it though, Poco even as "AOE" really is only healing 2 teammates + himself.  This new healer would need to make a significantly stronger heal if it's only going to heal a single teammate (and then maybe not him/herself?)
---
Can we ban you?
---
love it!
---
She‚Äôs like 10
---
Great idea! üëç
---
Glad someone understands my struggle
---
lol, I have the same amount of trophies as you have and literally stuck in the same situation.
---
I‚Äòm hoping for a new brawler to use those 150 powerpoints....
---
Beautiful üòçüòçüòçüòç
---
I got 3
---
Ah man you are actually right 
---
Actually got Crow yesterday, I can confirm it felt this good
---
Yes. Hopefully we could help actually make the change. Because I'm real sick of seeing the 105 brawler points in the shop when almost all of mine are already maxed like why
---
Beautiful art; thanks for sharing it!
---
Aha that explains a lot
---
How do people draw this good
---
Yes he did, at least in the video i saw like one week ago he did. I was watching and just changed to another channel.  I already find him annoying trying to laugh at everything, and making really bad jokes about everything, but when i saw him making excuses for supercell instead of talking about the shit matchmaking ... i never saw any of his videos again. 
---
I can‚Äôt ask questions? 
---
What is the point of this? They are going to have to kill each other eventually, don't they?
---
Are the quotes required?
---
Was the lvl 35 offer not worth it? And when was global launch?
---
WTF dude I'm at 2800 and I have nothing rarer then Penny
---
Can we ask why it seems to you too op? 
---
They kinda nerfed it. Try to. 
---
It's fine as a valid strategy, means they won't ban for it. But it just doesn't mean they cannot nerf (or try to nerf) it somehow. 
---
For example they will nerf (I hope so at least) Leon, but it doesn't mean you cannot play with this brawler now. 
---
It‚Äôs fan art not porn
---
Sexy 
---
Played nita on this map pretty good against the long and short range brawlers on this map won 4 out of 4 games
---
Can't wait for a small buff to Bo.  I already love him and can't wait for that Star Power.
---
Like any hobby or skill: practice, practice, and more practice.
---
I didn't found a way yo complain about it, but have the same problem, while the game is quite good, experience totally suck.
---
Supercell didn't managed to fix this in a while. 
---
Yeah he needs a slight damage buff
---
Got the same thing now I only getting coins, tickets or gems if I pulling boxes :/
---
Whats going on?
---
I'm not saying it isn't a good deal, I never once have claimed it isn't. I claimed that the offer misrepresented what many perceive to be the case. 
---
For example, I would estimate (this is speculation, but based in 5+ years experience in Supercell games) that 50% of the active players are under 14 years of age. This is because any launch of a new game brings in the bandwagoners, and those players leave within a few months at the most. Many of this base is still learning mathematics, and lack any skepticism in the internet whatsoever. When the offer is posted, the gems that aren't needed help convince them to purchase it due to the FOMO. 
---
I just personally think that while it may not benefit supercell as much, they should use the "original price" value be the same for if you had enough resources to purchase whatever is being offered in the deal. 
---
Lets take this for example. It should be 100 gems, not 106. You logically wouldn't buy the least efficient offer over and over again, literally wasting time and money. 
---
If there was an offer for 1600 gold, the price should be 190 gems (140 gems  + 50 gems). However, at Supercell's valuation this would be 213 gems. I know it may seem minor, but studies have shown that the first digit heavily impacts the impulse to buy a product (Hence why you say $X9.99 products). It takes advantage of a large portion of the player base, and I don't personally believe that should be happening. 
---
Just to recap, I agree with you. It's not a bad deal. And I agree that micro-transactions are the best source of revenue. I just disagree with the ethicality of what supercell is doing, especially with those who can't realize any tomfoolery in the offers. I see it as taking advantage of others, and I'm not saying there more egregious companies (EA), but it should be horrendous in itself to participate in this activity. Much less to not apologize for it.

I like how the flair is just "event 
---
no its not lol
---
If the post is so bad for being original and not doing what everyone else does.. how does it have 100 likes? ü§îü§î
---
Yeah SC only know the spoons
---
No. It's spamming automatic aimbots. 
---
The real question is, how do they team? They enter queue at the same time or what? And how do they do to win trophyes since they are 6 and they can't get first place at the same time, can they?
---
Remove the 0s and its 444-4444.
---
Boooooo, fof alg
---
Not rlly. Camping solo is boring, ,not really increasing in skill.

um actually we got penny and frank 6 months ago
---
Ya I lucked out with that
---
This. 
---
&gt;It's spamming automatic aimbots. 
---
Just stop, no one announces a meme format
---
Thats how mafia works üòÇ
---
Cool... I would like to see him in the game...
---
You forgot : rush to middle with all the fucking gems and die. Spam auto-aim.  Utilise bush. 
---
Do u push in showdown or are you teaming in other modes?
---
What is wrong?
---
What does that have to do with my comment
---
While you personally didn't need to pre-register to unlock the Shelly skin, it was a reward for meeting a set number of pre-registrations (1 million? can't remember the exact number)
---
You gotta get your hands dirty sometimes 
---
Just Tara ult everywhere and imagine if you playing her in that mode too
---
they need to nerf leon not auto aim, auto aim is already bad anyway, play rico, brock, piper, barley, mike, colt or spike and u'll see what I mean, its only use is when you are close to someone and you need to spam, apart from that maybe its op on shotgun brawlers but then again they will be close to you anyway...or atleast they should
---
Well it doesn't always work like that but I'm not saying Crow is bad, just the worst legendary
---
Hahaha I was sooo mad when my gf did this! After that she wont play gem grab with me anymore hahaha
---
These all fake they never ask you for your player ID and there many people with your username if you like or not also it‚Äôs just a bunch of code to make it seem like they are playing the game but they are not 
---
I'd rank him up to C
---
Doubt it. They just spin ard and share the same hatred for shotgunners. As for trophies i bet they just decreasin their odds of losing more at first
---
this would be nice tbh
---
RuSh ThE mId cHallEnGe
---
I didn't think that hard about it... It's just for jokes :(
---
I feel like this would be best if it dragged you slowly and it would just drag you in to just mess up your movement for a few seconds then you go back into it, if it was fast like tara‚Äôs super it would be deadly and bulls would also get dragged in can just kill you, so if these were just mini storms that trap you in then release you.
---
Yes I'm sure it would go over well if you have to relearn how to play the game after getting to 1k trophies
---
Forgot to add them
---
According to the Youtubers, Star Player is based on damage, not kills...so it wouldn't affect anything
---
yeah...you are right... but i would like to see a new brawler with a lower rarity... :D
---
I think you shouldnt change it right away, ask some other people about their opinion on the brawler, because as i said, i am certainly not a pro at the game, roughly at 1100 trophies so i dont think my opinion is optimal, but thanks for replying anyways.
---
Did you see my updated version in the comments? 
---
Thanks for the advice either way! &lt;3

Please stop

Bear!

I love it when kids whine about bad teammates "cheating"
---
Well this is only brawler to go invisible so sure
---
You obviously didn't read the bottom comment
---
DAMMIT JESSE!
---
you gotta love that sick hairline and sideburn for brocks hair
---
I have neither and wish I had any one. 
---
Beautiful
---
Dammit Jesse
---
Yeah i would definitely add the star power to brock's super, but barley's would be op.
---
Cool design, though I think he should have ketchup and mustard guns. 
---
Is this a joke? 
---
Hey I played you a few days ago!
---
Understandable. Have a good day :)
---
I have Verizon and I get fabulous connection. 
---
Omg stop just stop! 
---
Tara 
---
Why would someone ever do that though 
---
You guys are just beginners, and don't really know much about the game. Shelly is one of the worst brawler in the game. Her super is ONLY good when get very close. In another word, her super is not effective at all a little bit further away. 
---
Bear!

Maboi AY would've taken this spot, but his account got hacked. He had 11k with 20/21 brawlers back in the day. Congrats though.
---
Imagine winning games!

This post was made by The Every Other Brawler Gang.

I enjoy the same thing a lot with my son. 45/15 here now, but he got me on clash of clans about for years ago. That started it for us.
---
Ok,now lose with leon
---
Maybe faster projectile speed and make his attack narrower 
---
No prizes from trophy road do not affect prizes from boxes.
---
I am with sylfy on this one. I have never been waiting for more than say 5 seconds for a match. If I had to wait an extra 10 or so seconds for a more fair match, I would gladly
---
I waited 29 days for Spike to appear on my mini's shop. Twenty Nine Days. Crow appeared 4 times, and this was before Leon was added.
---
Why the boobs with glowing eyes? 
---
Thanksss
---
That happened to me lol
---
Can you do one for Penny?

Removed - DO NOT SUBMIT POSTS WITH TITLES IN ALL CAPS. CAPS LOCK IS CRUISE CONTROL FOR COOL

For optimal hydration

If I saw this in my lobby I would Frank out 
---
How did so much crates remained untouched tho
---
That's the local tab
---
Last time in brawl stars you could make your name have a colour by putting /c or something like that.
---
The game got more kid friendly
---
I was extremely polite to O.P and he was extremely rude in return, so I am just being honest about how bad this post is. I think you're  stressing about it more than I am.
---
Why did that Bull use his Super to change into the gas?
---
My first mortis match was in stormy plains 
---
thank you auto mod for correcting me the all caps in the title was a bit extreme!
---
I know I‚Äôm bad guys stop roasting me. I was just trying to point out that I‚Äôve never seen a brawler die after the match was over. I know that I fairly lost.
---
whatever dickhead

&gt;Yeeeee BOIIIII

.. of lag

Only 6.6k trophies tho &gt;:(

Nope I have T mobile and I am good

Probably your data line

It deals half the damage of meteors. Really tanks wouldn‚Äôt have to worry about it much if it did any less.

if you want to see your box odds, go to the shop, tap on any of the boxes, then tap the ‚Äúi‚Äù on the top left corner
---
Maybe scale the box with club size?

It‚Äôs a good idea, but there‚Äôs already a lot of area effect mods.

r/LootStars
---
ya i remember those days, i miss when leon wasn‚Äôt a brawler even tho i have him
---
Np his good rn maybe damage buff
---
I want him to have low hp compare to other shotgunners 
---
What do you think mods even do then?
---
Thats some dickheads
---
Yeah honestly, which sucks a lot, probably something to do with my phone
---
looks good, but honestly seems a little complicated. i‚Äôd recommend making the mid a bit more easy to access, or adding bridges across the water so that you‚Äôre not trapped. 
---
I got Leon through a regular brawl box
---
Don't make seperate comments

REPLY not comment 
---
Probably a desktop user r/Foundthepcuser

Ok first how does not releasing balance changes make them more money? Also, the tournament isn‚Äôt affecting their ability to work on the game because the dev team isn‚Äôt working on the tournament. Finally, this meme just doesn‚Äôt make sense. I‚Äôm pretty sure you‚Äôre trying to say that supercell is making a tournament instead of releasing balance changes because they want money. In this case why would the tournament be stopping balance changes from getting more money as this meme portrays. It just doesn‚Äôt make any sense if you think about it at all.
---
Do they still use dynamite in any game modes?
