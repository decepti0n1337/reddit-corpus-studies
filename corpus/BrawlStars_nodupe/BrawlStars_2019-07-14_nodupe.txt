30% less damage sounds so op!

No she is really underpowered

JESUS CHRIST NOBODY EVEN CARES ABOUT THE STORY OF POCAHONTAS!!!!!! EVERYONE JUST REMEMBERS THAT DUDE BECAUSE OF THE GUYS NAME.

What?

You can get gems for when robo mike comes out

Are you ok?

Sssooooooommmmmeeeee

Barley once told me the dynas gonna roll me. I ain‚Äôt the sharpest tool in the shed. They were looking kinda dumb with their spinning and their teaming and they spotted me and now I‚Äôm dead. Well they don‚Äôt stop coming and they don‚Äôt stop coming. Meteors do your job because I am running. Even the ticks try to join for some fun but even an Mortis cant out run. So many tries so many deaths so much trophies lost now I‚Äôm stressed. Supercell please fix this. Because I am now pissed
---
It hurt itself in confusion!
---
I‚Äôm 20 and down voted
---
its true kkkkk
---
JD is cute

You mean in real life, right
---
Not needed

Today I had frank at 80 trophies power 5. I pushed him to 300 through Duo Showdown. You gotta make sure it‚Äôs a good map for standing as a threat though. Now, the true question. How tf you a person main? I can‚Äôt play Pam for life.
---
Thanks!!
---
Crow after the buff: Well yes, but actually no
---
r/wooooshwith4os
---
I use night mode on Reddit and Mortis is my worst(below 400) brawler. I'm a Leon main(700+) and I use discord everyday without the invisible status.
---
How about maxing our your brawlers and getting the last one
---
Don‚Äôt be rude
---
My tick is level 2 has at rank 15 but I can't push him any further
---
Finally someone else noticed.

London? Is that your village?

Shelly's Super is the Star Player.

Just saw that this person posts this on many posts for karma

What piper needs is a star power with speed boost

Shes a sniper she needs to run the fuck away alot lol

a yellow submarine!

Impressive! What did you play to grind?
---
Or just a speed bosot in general
---
Great concept but kinda crowded

Unfair, you got it on crow

Do it on Poco or something so you can experience the euphoria of true h e L L

You get star points /s

He is talking about the power 1 Pam
---
Na not for karma, but as a prank
---
How many do you not? Because the math isn‚Äôt adding up.

the level 35 deal was given at the time you got to it, and it cost hat much

the summer bundle came out for the same price while the level 35 one came back at the same time as the summer bundle coning in

Power box seems interesting, for one you have to leave spawn to gather them and also if you die you can't get them back.

Hello. Where is your user flair?
---
and you think mortis is good? also i doubt you do people can literally say whatever they want and say it‚Äôs true, but i played this game the day it came out in Canada so i‚Äôve seen the ups and downs of all the characters and trust me mortis and never been worse than he is now
---
Yeah exactly, that's why crow didnt need the buff.
---
He wasnt played as intended, same thing is happening but with mortis and poco

Brawlball, solo, gem grab sometimes

I hope you get banned from this subreddit. You keep spamming this dumb shit on every post, it‚Äôs not funny at all

better than wonderbrad at least. XD

I feel like Mortis was a great pick for a while, but due to all of the other brawlers getting their buffs, Mortis is in an awkward situation.

I hate when teamer waste their super to try and kill you, like that jessie could save her turret for a more important situation like if she gets low or something but no she throws it right in your feet just to fuck with you.

Pathetic.
---
Let
---
Oh God. I really is the same guy. RIP us
---
I throw like this all the time in brawl ball to see posts like this xD
---
Exactly. I was laughing when she just set out her turret for no dang reason.
---
TF happened
---
The boss should spawn on them rather than near you... Idk why they havent changed that yet
---
Is today repost day ?
---
First dj khaled meme, then the gene lamp now that ?
---
They are damage strength indicators. Not ‚ÄúKill or safe‚Äù.
---
Stop being a fruitcake.
---
Yeah...But I guess every showdown mod can't be specifically targeting or excluding teamers. It's like they're getting special attention.
---
*AHHHH*
---
How ?
---
I mostly play showdown with him so idk
---
Ok thanks cos there‚Äôs only 10 mins left of there‚Äôs so it‚Äôs probably gonna happen soon
---
So you can get 400 coins instead of 300!
---
r/throwergang rise up. This was great
---
I‚Äôm afraid that the Big Brawler could hide too easily, and could just escape with the spring trap when they got caught
---
In that case I think the second is better, because usually when you kill someone like a dynsmike, you don't need the extra help. Plus, his teleport in dash and really reck thrower teams if they group up.
---
If you get bored with the game, u shouldn't have it
---
Me too dude, i have 24 Brawlers and i'm in the same cups :)
---
And he is very map specific with low dps
---
Banning it isn't the way to go, although discouraging it e.g putting modifiers on every map is good and other stuff to discourage it
---
it's only 30% extra health if you are below 40% . it's not rosa super .shellies and jessie turrets will still destroy you.
---
They strongly imply it
---
How does it work? I we can't watch the streaming how do we now who was the winner? Would you Supercell  contact the winner on Twitter? How's that?
---
Obviously Sherlock
---
A way to make it not abusable would be to allow the player to get off a anytime but I think that would make it op
---
Thats a nice idea
---
yeah but compared to the other brawlers where u need to aim ur shots precisely (rather than aiming in a general direction), he is more of a low skill cap brawler. His attack is not a burst, unlike colt's and ricos where you need to move accordingly after the initial shot. His attack range is very wide, meaning a general aim in the enemies' direction would do the trick. most of the time you can just tap on the super button to heal ur teammates. 
---
if u think poco is hard to push u can find a team and play him in gem and bb maps with less walls. gem : stone fort with double tanks, flooded mines as a mid and etc. I personally think hes better in bb as he gets outclassed by most gen carriers in gem OwO. bb: u can play him on every map just keep in mind that hes better in open quarters.

Yes, but it still lasts forever, unlike Rosa's, and Shellys and Turrets still come at you in normal games, now you'd just have extra protection to deal with them.

I do play with Gene :P

If you have a brawler with high power level (and a retarded sence of humor) you can lose on purpose and with that achieve:

Pissing of your teammate while deranking

Have an unfair advantage over new players when you rank up

And you will be an asshole which cant be reported.

I think that... and I‚Äôd say I have a fairly good grasp on the game and have a decent amount of common sense left. So please feel free to change my mind and prove me wrong with evidence from pro play and/or ladder. From my point of view, Spike is extremely versatile and useful in so many situations, more than most other brawlers! But I‚Äôm no expert so please enlighten me!
---
I‚Äôm sorry everyone I‚Äôm a dumb shit. Yes I know I ment hair.

Time to never play brawl stars again

anybody can get to 500 , get to 700 to prove your skill

A modern day adaptation of *pong*
---
What game mode do you play him?
---
I have tested this for quite a while and was only successful when the player was in a direct vertical line from the enemy, though there is some wiggle room. The distance needed to do this is about 1/2 to 1/3 of Darryl‚Äôs super length, though again, there‚Äôs a bit of wiggle room. Once the super is activated, begin moving backwards and a second hit should land. This technique can be very useful to get in some extra damage. It even stuns the enemy for a tiny bit longer, allowing more damage to be dealt without the enemy being able to attack!
---
Haha

Congrats!

Thanks

Such as
---
It was easy, try it! Took me an afternoon
---
You need to be directly under an enemy and use your Super when the enemy is a bit over 1/2 the super length. Then, while your super is active, begin moving backwards! There should be a second hit.
---
Nice work. He‚Äôs definitely one of the best skins

Same dude.

What did you do?

Jes. Im Speaking German.

Correct, that information I posted there is incorrect.

Your telling people the wrong way but okay haha
---
Ok health? She‚Äôs is in the 2nd lowest health pool with Rico, barley, crow and spike and the only one lower is tick. Yeah she does good damage at far range but Brock is way better. He is just more consistent piper with a better super. And pipers super is decent but with its slow move speed it‚Äôs easy for a dyna or a sharpshooter to line up a shot when she lands.

I agree. 12.3.1 is something to get excited over üòÆ

---
M8 there is a difference between having a good map and a badly designed one, yours is full of one tile gaps, thats not even "allowed". And no, Boss Fight isnt easy lol, no one has reached the end of it so far,  not even close. And balancing the game around "p2w" is just a recipe for disaster, its like making a Competitive game and balancing it around the Casual meta, it doesnt work that way. The game having a big gap between Casual and Competitive play is a general problem, not a Big Game one that can be fixed with a map xd

Yea he‚Äôs the first brawler I maxed. It took me a while but when I hit power 8 there was a deal in the shop and just bought the rest of his pps there. He‚Äôs not that great until he can do at least 1000 per hit.
---
I had that happen to me
---
Reduced to pixels on your screen
---
Am the random
---
Well kinda probably yes, but i was also correcting him, as I mentioned all other countries, not only Finland.
---
Brawl stars sort of has that already though...
---
Agreed. Bo is one of the brawlers that are always underestimated. Especially when it comes to close range fights. If all three arrows hit, he actually does a lot of damage considering hes a ranged brawler

What happens when you jail break

Tick: i turned every map and gamemode into a minefield
---
Haha amateurs i remember the days when the game was horizontal and there was no auto aim and heist only had one side with a vault
---
Post this at r/MortisGang and you will be treated as a god
---
Tea mate
---
yes, cant think of manual aim when primo is on top of me
---
I would love to be on red team lol
---
But for real this map great!
---
No hell no man. My Bibi is lvl 4 at rank 20 my lowest lvl yet and my best brawlerüò≠
---

---
I do remember it to but i wqsnt playing back then it wasnt in my country i could just watch vids
---
cool, 3d printer?
---
Sure link me to vid once uploaded
---
Watch when you‚Äôre spinning, el Primo jumps at you whit his super ..... now that‚Äôs an epic gamer moment
---
Hahaha its a risk I have to take
---
Yes I do this all the time
---
Ive been playing the game for almost 2 years and 5 months now lol, so everything that happened b4 the beta probably took that long if not longer
---
I down voted
---
What's up whit uou pepole shaking the screen?
---
Why does every El Primo in a replay have those weird cracks on the back of his head?
---
This box was free
---
cause you're so awful
---
Shut up
---
They told me to ping them when we played a couple hours ago :)
---
I want one of two skins, they are amazing and I hope I'm going to win. I'm too happy

i was gonna recommend something very similar

I killed a mecha crow, who I think just might‚Äôve won oj‚Äôs twitch giveaway

#When they steal all your gems even though they aren't supposed to be the gem carrier
---
I'm little afraid of this shelly. and kinda delight about the looks.  
---
i'm very confused right now.  
---
Also, bought this skin today! Yay!(?)
---
This is a stolen post. Your so lazy and unoriginal, stop stealing other people‚Äôs things originally from u/cieNNe
---
Are you streaming on Twitch? If so, what's your name in that platform?
---
How powercube can won?
---
Don't suck
---
I see we share a similar mindset when it comes to pushing trophys
---
I am acutally 500+
---
I did try a while ago, quite tough though because if you never get to charge your super, nita is pretty much not that useful compared to other options. Might be better for other maps though! Haven‚Äôt tried it enough yet.

Why cant Brawl stars can just be the most popular game like coc?...

---
r/croppingishard
---
Poco Wick, coming to a theater near you

I'm pretty sure this a repost
---
Basically for any Brawler: If u keep facing teammers in Solo Showdown, go for Duo Showdown or some other 3v3 matches like heist
---
Meh
---
No the actual pic
---
r/iwannadie

I feel bad for you. I have 19 brawlers at 4.9k but this is probably worse. Good luck in all your boxes.

I usually do right in the morning (around 8 EST) because most people are awake and going to their jobs, and what better thing to do in the morning than scroll Reddit? 
---
Also, if your meme does make it to hot, it will gain even more as the day progresses. But if you post right before bedtime, if it makes it to hot, no one will see it and upvote overnight, causing the algorithm to not label it as rising anymore.
---
I have 21 at 500
---
Awesome
---
Ok i know 
---
I made that tag before i know what that means

I just decided to put that tag because everyone does

To change üò≠

It‚Äôs how bibis hitbox supposed to work
---
Spoiler alert
---
Pro player huh
---
Auto aim
---
Then there would only be 9 players
---
I will report and downvote that repost
---
U mean that i copy ? Nop i didnt
---
Last time i opened mega box it had 7 items, i got star power and bibi
---
I think Nita had a lil lag
---
Yep, all the criticisms are about that, I have to make sure that the next meme I will make is better than this one
---
What app are you using?
---
Sometimes it's better then having teammate
---
And they suicide ;-;
---
What app are you using
---
Right just sticking to youtube.its called as Soul-BrawlStars
---
And let him go down, when a close range brawler has his only weakness nullified by invisibility it deserves the nerf hammer
---
Crow is pretty hard to use at first but you‚Äôll get use to it as u go on just mark enemies with poison and it‚Äôll guarantee a win for u
---
yeah people really despise being original
---
I know i am stupid 
---
But i hate teaming
---
But everyone wants team so i just run
---
üèÉ
---
You mean trio
---
But what happens when an unstoppable force meets an unbreakable barrier
---
Great more cancer
---
nope this is all real
---
Dont have mortis, soo no
---
Bo
---
Why on earth do people do that? I would kill the last person as fast as I can...
---
I really don't get why people get greedy eventhough this game can turn the other way very easily..

Idk

This is hilarious

To prevent Darryl from being able to roll forever, he'll turn on his own without hitting anything towards the nearest land after a certain amount of time.

That's crazy lucky... Insane box indeed

That could work though when someone is in a narrow space

That's pretty smart actually, if you can get the enemy in the middle they're guaranteed to die
---
Link for BenTimm1 isn‚Äôt working
---
It‚Äôs so sad that someone could actually make this meme.  We have so many Brock skins, we don‚Äôt know what to do with them
---
you auto aim Piper's super!?
---
Lol

XDD

I feel your pain!

---
The guy was jumping on the jumpad of today‚Äôs map. Like at least 6 times, all without success, and then after that he didn‚Äôt get a single shot lol

I only aim shelly's super to scare them away

Lol if i only was a man....

That‚Äôs the idea :)

---
Yeah, Colt looks like he's starving.
---
This dude has 2 karma. How can you believe this them?
---
Ohhh....
---
I finally got it after looking at it for few minutes
---
Alot of people are complaining that this star power is op and abuseable.To fix it I first like you to check out rp_well.He made a comment fixing quite a bit of problems.
---
Here are my proposed improvements.
---
1.stun based on health.Brawlers over 6000 hp are stunned for 3-5 seconds.Brawlers over 4000 get 3 seconds.Then all the others get 2 seconds of stun.
---
Most other problems were fixed by rp_well in his comment so I think you should definitely check his comment out.
---
HOW CAN YOU COMPLAIN ABOUT THIS
---
Nita and Green Nita
---
Bibi  you n me trash
---
good
---
Weird flex but ok
---
When someone brakes the cones and ball gets in that tile
---
Ah, ok.
---
You see? Everytime somebody do something that other reddiors dont do everytime, they lose points. I tried to understand the joke. Why they hated my tought?
---
Sorry I can't read Italian.
---
You know it
---
I got Spike
---
freaking*
---
Here I am sitting at 6969 with every brawler in the game
---
If u have problem go make post about it, im completly fine with the trophy system as i am able to get alot of star points as i was high in trophies before balance already.
---
Same
---
Yeah I never said I got it from a small box.
---
But in general, which one is better?
---
Go check it out! :D hope you like it!
---
No, when you start the game, first few matches are with bots, so this is a bot
---
Awesome tip! I'll be sure to use that.
---
Yup, time to relax and play some Minecraft üòé
---
Good meme :D
---
Super important
---

Well played with the "EA" thing .

I‚Äôm no expert but I‚Äôll try to help out.
---
The background wasn‚Äôt really needed, you can leave it as it originally was.
---
You can try zooming in on each kill, just a little addition in the video. 
---
You can get sound effects from YouTube, there‚Äôs a lot available there, although I‚Äôm not sure about copyright stuff.
---
And, well, just keep trying to make new stuff, and you‚Äôll learn more eventually!

ur slow in grinding .... I grinded in Sep 2017 and 10k in December
---
Or bull's
---
Ayyyyeeee thank you for the mention!!
---
This would be SO much cooler then what we have! Also solves the problem when one team spawn a 20+ level siege and other team has no chance even if they had %100 against enemy's %15 IKE. I hope devs see this.
---
No

GMT is a time zone on 0¬∞ Longitude and we use to determine time (every 15¬∞ difference in longitude from the prime meridian is 1 hour difference, west of 0¬∞ longitude = less than Gmt, east of P.M. = more than gmt)

UTC is a time standard

You know, sometimes I do ~~hate~~ love randoms.

that's why I don't play sd, I stick to duos for star token and then push in 3v3
---
*How can powercube win?
---
shelly wasn't op before band-aid, she was actually one of the worst brawlers in the game
---
I would buy this, as a figurine
---
I‚Äôm so happy they made it about having fun :)
---
Yeah man...i unfollowed that guy
---
The Clayman has a another for that has his looking all messed up and sad which kinda looked like imo Robo Spike
---
Lol
---
Wrong chat bro
---
Haha yes this is very funny relatable post 
---
Big funny 
---
Very original,  totally haven't seen the exact same kind of post 3 days ago
---
It hurts my soul watching a Colt completely miss his super.
---
Report them for ‚Äúharassment‚Äù
---
Even his normal attack is a mini Lucian ult and by moving around like it IS one you can hit more
---
Yo that primo is on my friends list lmao
---
Pretty eüÖ±Ô∏èic
---
#*G E N E*
---
How do you know your chance to get a Legendary?
---
It‚Äôs not even that great...
---
It's the same as the first attack lol
---
There should be a penalty at the least. I too think teaming is not bannable but a penalty for making the game unfair for other players. Mass teaming is the bad thing if there's just a team of two people I think that could be fine but if it reaches something like four then they all get like...a -50 trophy penalty, while they try to resolve it.
---
I never said I grind lol just a casual player

but bull has more firepower than a shelly, even with her super charged
---
Ugh... He haven't played duo even once
---
Totally, mecha crow and bo are just recolors...
---
Ayy, you got the hair right.
---
I'll hide in bushes in solo to push trophies even when I have a bad connection Which is all the time lol.But yes never any team based game it's just messed up.
---
All i'm missing is Tick and Spike, but only because I bought Crow. Everyone else is here.
---
True üôè
---
No it's not the max is 12 from a small box
---
Who's the other one, crow
---
They should also add ‚Äúyou shutting up‚Äù or ‚Äúyou going away‚Äù
---
Not as pro as auto-aiming piper's super
---
4:20 isn‚Äôt that great of a time though tbh, try to get at least 6 mins then it will be better. For now the title does not fit what time you have gotten, for it is too low of a time to be fair.

Strike out lol

Can they attack while piggybacking?
---
That's not how reddit works kid.

R.I.P robo rumble glitch

Rico is for his new thic look and Frank is for his super.
---
Yeah, the main problem is that we didn't have really strict rules and our major concern was to fill every hour with a streamer, so we started opening exceptions for some letting them stream for more hours in order to fill the gaps.   
---
Unfortunately, we haven't anticipated this problem, but we'll use this information to improve our next events.   
---
Sorry for the trouble, but thank you for the valuable feedback! :)

There‚Äôs ppl like him everywhere.

 people like this are everywhere

Now you see Penny just got some power points so that means she can‚Äôt get a star power in the same box so this is photoshopped but damn this is some good photoshop

What‚Äôs that one awful map that‚Äôs just bushes

riochann didnt even make the bandita shelly art, plus this art style looks diffrent than hers. (or his idk)

Hell no that makes no sense also jessie like 15 or younger while bull is about 20. Bibi like 17 18 so it makes more sense. Also im pretty sure the junker family is

It is possible to get 14 gems from a small box actually.

I agree, this does seem possible.

It‚Äôs not a scam he‚Äôs legit

I got the same deal but for shelly!

I bought one the day prior for 20 bucks, 360 gems and the 5 boxes. I was hoping they released the leon offer for 500 gems very soon, woke up at 4 am the next day and saw they had the offer for 600, but for crow. Got the summer pack opened the chest got leon and bought crow for 600.

---
Yur, I've opened about 60-70 boxes and haven't gotten a single one of the 7 brawlers I have at level 9/10 :)  super frustrating
---
*follows you* I hope it's not too late
---
I don't see the problem???
---
Did you literally just repost the top post of the subreddit?
---
We all know the new star powers
---
This is what outlaw Colt should've been
---
Yeh it helps.
---
I ve just bought (for 2000 coins) the new star power and you re absolutely right! For example in the current gem grab map curve ball is amazing! While in the current brawl ball one fertilizer works really better
---
What the hell is that face
---
Let me guess, the only brawler you need are legendaries?
---
Bro I made it with a photo on google and meme generator
---
There is no way you should be expected to win a poco vs Shelly. I could literally 10-0 anyone in the world playing poco while I‚Äôm shelly in a showdown map.
---
I don‚Äôt have to. Won plenty of showdowns truly solo. But sometimes, teaming is the smart strategy. You pansy stop the spin try hards are probably the first people to spin in game.
---
Holy shit that sucks
---
I opened  90 boxes and got Band-Aid
---
still wanting an health buff for crow and an damage nerf for spike
---
It's actually a mega box
---
Omg
---
This is very true. I‚Äôve noticed far less teaming lately. And it‚Äôs fun. But if you‚Äôre telling me you wouldn‚Äôt team to beat a Shelly with band aid and her super, you‚Äôre a liar.
---
I feel like Supercell should wait for the meta to stabilize after releasing \*all\* of the new star powers before tweaking anything. It seems like star powers in general are getting much stronger so we might find Shelly to be relatively over powered once everything is live.
---
Upvote pls to see brawl stars members idea skin
---
It‚Äôs been so long since I‚Äôve gotten a new brawler I can‚Äôt hear this one
---
Mortis in Boss Fight? Really?
---
its an actual skin that hasn't been released yet
---
Original : http://aminoapps.com/p/xhl9is
---
great another legendary that i will not get because of low legendary chance but atleast i have crow
---
Those morti are a disgrace
---
At least you get power cubes for killing the bot
---
Thats true
---
You should do Duo Showdown Deltarune Style
---
Wtf 
---
Why don‚Äôt u ever get legendaries, epics, or mythics then?
---
No way!
---
Yes, sure, go ahead!
---
Removed. Keep your post titles descriptive and provide context. Additionally do not use low effort/all caps/clickbait titles.
---
There is a brock shaped Hole In My Brock Shaped Heart
---
I have all the mythics but Pam was my only epic. I got Spike out of a normal box, and then Piper from a Big Box the next day. My legendary chance is 0.04 now lol
---
I get so many brawlers sooo easily but when it comes to legendaries its like a water drop chilling in the oven
---
6.6k with 23
---
I figured that out by accidentally auto-aiming a box to death lol.
---
This is it
---
Rank 16 now!
---
&gt;Leon is still new
---
As new as global and 3D?
---
I am at 11k without any mythic or legendary brawler
---
I‚Äôm at 3000 trophies yet I don‚Äôt have any epics, mythics, or legendaries. (Or even all of the super rares)! Thanks supercell ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
You Rock: 1
---
You Suck: 0
---
Thanks. I‚Äôm starting to learn that constantly chipping at an enemy‚Äôs health then going in for the kill is the way to go... maybe that‚Äôs because I‚Äôm still power 1?
---
So you can talk with a friend while he tells you where the enemies are

Thanks for the correction!

No, she is a copier that could copy the brawler you have, so the ease of use of her is 0

Ok

---
Yeah, pretty much that actually i am sure too...
---
OUTPLAYED! Nice work!
---
I could push to 17k with that account I only have 23 brawlers so I could only push to 12k so good for u that u have the amazing account
---
you didn‚Äôt, the enemy shelly outted the ball to their goal
---
Just so u no Nita is Bo's kid. Guess the father of leon ... Bo.
---
So it be weird
---
The ones you unlocked.
---
that‚Äôs the worst question ever, but no you can‚Äôt choose them to brawlers you don‚Äôt have
---
This cracked me up. Was expecting Thic Pam... Got Thic Tick! Lol
---
At least the star power gets nerf
---
It Bibi u probably know by know
---
I dont really play showdown but i didnt experience teaming till 11k
---
Howdy
---
Hap cake day :3
---
Minty to my fav

Lol of course they do!.. buy a Mega Box. That should give you enough gold to be able to get it

 I have 9.5k never see teaming unless there dynamike a

That looks like a demo or test account.

---
Then he deserves downvotes
---
Mom: why you crying so damn loud?
---
I'm in the same boat as you mate. 8.5k trophies no legendaries or bibi
---
Ya I see it every game, I‚Äôm at 14.85k
---
Why all want a legendary they are trash when u get them u will see
---
This subreddit has gone to shit.
---
Cue downvotes from the 14 year olds who think they can meme.
---
It means shelly is great
---
Yeah but there are people in 13k without legendaries, do you think that it should increase once you hit 10k?
---

---
Energy drinks, 6 items in mega boxes, etc.
---
Aii cool
---
i don't find any think wrong to be p2p if u r unlucky like me who play for 6 fucking months and still didnt get mortis or any legendary. before u ask yes i am p2p just to buy leon cuz he is my favorite brawler
---
I had a friend 700 on on el primo, shelly 12, nita 18, colt 0, jessie 0, bull 0, rosa 0, barley 0

r/shittybrawlstars

That's blessed wdym?
---
Not the worst... i have a friend has 700 on elp rimo and only shelly and nita amd el primo have been used

I thought the trophy road Mega Boxes were rigged ... I wasn't even able to get any star powers
---
nah akbar means greater and kabir means great and alakbar mean the greatest
---
We need a different coulour of hat
---
Yes.

It's not though, it's just as hard as it was before, just different trophy hieghts

True... we love hats, but not green

Where are the lewd female brawlers
---
*That crap give karma, like rain in london when the student want a miracle in his cruel exam*
---
Damn, why the downvotes? It's not like I'm saying "Plz, buff gene", I'm just trying to hear what people think about It.
---
English please
---
It's still not worse than Bo
---
It did not devalue skill, it simply made it easier for everyone to gain trophies, but the skill part is still there.
---
It took some people skill to reach 500, now you need that very same skill at 800
---
Except the Brawlers in the bottom row are noticeably blurrier than the Leon on top, indicating scaling, either up or down
---
B A R L E Y
---
The problem is not always the player dude.
---
Good work Nita as I said once before at Mortis gang they ain‚Äôt the only ones to stop teaming so us little guys gotta help them as well
---
U can't get good timing if you play with randoms
---
Yep, the players benefited from this update outwayys that of the pros saltiness
---
Teaming in solo showdown

Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

&gt;Greetings Brawl Stars! I address you with my most respect and despair. Well I want to file a complaint or rather ask if it is normal that I have been playing the game since the official release and I still do not get new brawlers, only the common ones (no mythical, epic, legendary), and those of trophy rewards. I have 5 thousand drinks and I play a lot every day. It's also getting boring and exasperating to use the same brawlers again and again with more than rank 15. I've also bought offers with real money and my luck is vague. I know that the game works with a percentage of odds and so on, but friends and family with fewer trophies and without buying offers have such rare brawlers. It is unfair and disappointing, because as I mentioned, I play Brawl stars since its launch and I love it, but it is very frustrating.
---
Ok and? People have grinded 1k a day before.

So what, fuck the pros. Yall just petty. Everyone benefits from this update.
---
I am sorry but what is area 51, I‚Äôve seen a lot of posts about it but I don‚Äôt even know what it is. I am sorry if it is a stupid question.

It definitely does. Nice catch!

Oh yeah and thanks mate

I mean it‚Äôs not bad. A little messy on the sides and might need more symmetry to not give the enemy an unfair advantage. Overall pretty goo-IS THAT A MOTHERFUCKING ONE TILE GAP?!!

 No

It‚Äôs not a serve... it‚Äôs a game

I have the J3 Eclipse, feels bad man.

I like the idea but I can see trolls just using it to run you into the storm

great!

A lot of them are genuinely creative and well done though.

Brawl Ball, Heist, Gem Grab, Bounty, and Siege maps have to be diagonally mirrored, but otherwise, :)

P.S. 1 tile gaps ARE bad :(
