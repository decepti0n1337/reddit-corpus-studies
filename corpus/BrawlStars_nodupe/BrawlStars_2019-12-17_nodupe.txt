Yep
---
On the maps that I've seen he fits into wild West.
---
k whats wrong with him reposting his own post
---
yeah I've heard people praising 8-Bit, but I've never seen it used effectively in Boss Fight personally. I don't know how it can actually work, considering it's so slow.  
---
In my experience the best compositions are 2 Colts 1 Pam or 2 Pams 1 Colt but, of course, you can't get that with a premade party. Once you get to VII+ insane tho, it's very easy to end up in the same game if you queue at the same time. Other than this, Colt+Pam+Shelley may be my favorite composition. I know Bull is highly appreciated, but without power cubes he is too ineffective in mid-late game, he needs those cubes, and I think Pam is the better choice for carrying cubes. Shelley with her super and Shell Shock is pretty useful.

Anyway, I'll PM you my in-game ID

Okey, if not that would be stealing

no it isn‚Äôt he only did it twice, whether he reposted this stupid excuse of a post is besides the point

Oof I have 1 and 3, and just lost 700 trophies to season reset. Not ready at all

Didn't you see kairos, he didn't cover any of the new brawlers but he put them in the title and the thumbnail, and before the brawl talk, he write in the title of a video he make there's a new brawler named pete coming in but  in the video he said it's a concept  bruh

I actually found out about this when I was shooting for a thumbnail. I screenshotted when Rosa was killing me, and when I saved the screenshot.... She just stopped. I wasn't able to record that first match, so I tried several times. It only worked with Rosa for me. And then I got it again, and recorded it.

What‚Äôs so funny?

It's just luck, you can't predict it, it may happen sooner or later.

I remember getting my first rare brawler at like 7k but i had brawlers of other rarities.

Also if you don't get any brawlers for a long time, you might get a few in a row once you do get one.

1 tile bushes don't work I'm afraid... So I would make a 2-on-3 tiles lawn in the middle and besides that, two 2-on-2 tiles lawns at each side, and mirror it at the other side.

I mean yes, but if you start now there's not really a point. I usually open all my saved boxes after an update and start saving the day or couple days after. This turned out to be the best for me: around 30 big boxes and 200 regular ones saved up at the moment.

Wtf was the others team bo doing. Sometimes i jst feel like some people's brains are malfunctioning

I know... but. I only go against people at 12k, and the brawlers they use are also high, which means they either mastered how to use the brawler, and perfectly counter me every time, or they are so try hard, that they seem good.

Fail :P

Thanks. And it's really annoying that those boxes last only 2 days. They could have been there for whole season and you can buy whenever you want to. That way if you are just short of points you can collect them afterwards.

The new Colt skin is very pretty! I think I would keep Colt's

Isn't it pointless to save boxes because all of the boxes you open ,which do not give you a brawler increase your chance of getting one?
---
So technically it's like the same
---
firth
---
Some times randoms are the worst but when you get good randoms play straight forward 10-20 matches with them. I have got lot of bad randoms due to which my tick suffers but just one match with a god random and that's it 50-60 trophies increase or just play with your friends

I think that the other skin

Horrible Histories I assume? Albeit a reversed quote, but still a jolly good reference!

Actually they changed it because 50 power points have too much value even though it‚Äôs the same as 100 coins.

Sandy super will have infinite range, but has same  span time as normal Sandy.

Crow super will place daggers and he won't get recharging super from attacks but has recharge time and daggers will disapear right after crow uses his super.

Spike super will allow him to become natural spike cactus wall and spawn around map wall cactususes.

I think this idea has potential but the way you have worded it is very hard to understand and some mechanics are far too complicated.

Maybe try making it simpler and easier to understand

There will be a system to meet random where you can choose brawler together before the game and communicate to suggest brawler or map

yeah

It happened to me today argh

Oh yeah, I clicked on it and it wouldn't load or some thing. Later, I login and found that it had been replaced with 100 coins. Honestly, I liked the 100 coins more, because I don't desire to upgrade any brawler at the very moment, and the ones I use are just waiting for their star powers.

The truth hurts boys

Oh shit I'm stupid. My bad

I agree get rid of these two and make the new present game mode permanent

Ok thx
---
 But 50 pp is pretty much 100 coins right?
---
I think that the 50 power point thing was meant to be given in anothet day, and was quickly fixed to 100 coins as intended. Not sure but maybe Devs will clarify. The 100 coins is still very appreciated since most games don't even have these events. :)

he really doesn't. he is one of the more "begginer friendly" brawlers ( despite being a legendary ), in which i mean he is really easy to play. like shelly and jessie.

idk, i'd rather have  a trash leon than an op one :/

yesterday i got sandy from the big box now i have all brawlers thanks supercell

The SC icon seems to have the feature of the OLD El Primo icon, yours seems designed on NEW El Primo icon. So, good work. Your observation are fitting a lot
---
Frank has already said that the 100 coins was originally tomorrow‚Äôs gift, but they have replaced it with today‚Äôs 50 powerpoints due to a bug. Tomorrow‚Äôs gift will be a big box to compensate today‚Äôs hiccups.
---
MY THOUGHTS EXACTLY!
---
Here only snappy sniping is the way to go as u can deal more dmg to the boss. Ambush is good in most of the other gamemodes.....
---
It can happen...But it's very rare... I'm guessing that Shelly did exceptional
---
When that happens, you should think of it as a challenge! Me and my friends have beaten Star Power players together - it's a good chance to prove yourself!
---
It  was a bug check frank's twitter.
---
You know, your chance to get starvpowers goes up, too. Also, since they added twice as many star powers, the chance had to go down as much.
---
Max speeds up the whole team and bea slows them through walls, that‚Äôs their supers
---
And plus the star powers lower your legendary percents üò§

To back this up we have team comps of casuals going into battle with different power levels. If matchmaking considered this, it'll be slow. And since you're so high up in trophies, prove yourself able to beat down those guys with Star Power. Matchmaking isn't here to intentionally screw you over, it's here to help you have fun.

I know. Me too.

Well maybe it's because I'm more focused on Brawl Stars YouTubers leaking new brawlers tbh

---
Sometimes they're under a lot of pressure from a lot of people shooting at then so it's either grab the cubes and run or give the cubes to the enemy
---
Life leech is just as bad LOL. Pam, Tick, Crow and a few other brawlers reign supreme

OMG IS THIS A COINCIDENCE I MET THIS EXACT SAME GUY

Lone Star is actually soo easy if you have a leon XD ik because I have one
---
New brawlers are gonna frick my chances
---
slowed bcuz the wiring has bcome 2 hottt
---
I think the map is way too small for Present Plunder. The games will be so short.
---
Mortis is just fun, he is one of the worst brawlers to play in BrawlBall in soloq.He needs his team to make space so that he can play in the space that his team creates for him, really team dependant.
---
Google forms might work
---
super

BeaTS
---
Ihave. Good idea for skin carl leonard,when Carl goes, mushrooms appear and ,he throws a mushroom, he appears as a golden mushroom
---
Uh.... i forgot sorry
---
make it a modifier for maps that are manifested with teamers
---
Nice one
---
Except sometimes when its showdown they wont wait and take it even though the other dou has 0 power cubes and are all the way across the map
---
Same shit different story
---
Better than dying you stupid fucknut.
---
Key\*
---
Even though they are really hard, I think those two game modes are the only ones where (in my case) Colt and Leon are really useful. Colt for takedown, and Leon for lone star.
---
Lone Star is by far the worst mode
---
Why?
---
But i dont know how
---
I play mortis in brawl ball and his good but you need not to be aggressive just need to time it
---
Showdown biggest teaming in the history of brawl, on high PP trophies
---
And leon is the cutest, i think. Spike  tick and nita  are also cute.
---
I only got 100 coins =c
---
Yes you are ready all the best
---
I agree. I wouldn't want them to take them down. Also these modes are the only ones (other than survival) where you can play by yourself, and basically it depends on your skill (and luck). Other game modes you must play with randoms, and that basically depends on luck.
---
Showdown is the favourite of the majority of people
---
I LOVE YOU MR BAT

U just changed the smile, the problem is her head shape

Duo is fine
---
I agree with the post.
---
I don't see many people teaming in showdown, but I that happens. Showdown is my favourite mode so I would be vary upset if it get deleted lol
---
I am ready as well one megabox I hope I get it
---
I know but there isnt any button says edit i pressed 3 dots there isnt
---
I actually don't like duo
---
What trophies have you been? (in PP)
---
I mean if they can win it's fine you still get ur trophies right?
---
Legit me when I was at 150 trophies. 
---
RN, I have 12250 trophies.

I just got my first one yesterday.

I wonder though,if they removed it because of that,then how are there so many people complaining about it?

If you mean my highest, around 900

I guess Supercell don't want to make another mistake by adding a new game mode as a permanent thing just like that. The new game modes are being added as a temporary event so in case they end up being bad, supercell just have to remove it without further explanation to the people who actually enjoyed it, like Graveyard shift. And in case the game mode is liked by the community, they can actually add it as a permanent mode, knowing that the people is enjoying it.

your are so lucky you got leon at 0 trophies from 0 boxes now push him on "ush"
---
It's in the shop at discount..
---
‚Äú once you have unlocked rewards of a certain type, for example rare brawlers,, The probability of getting *all* other rewards increases.‚Äù
---
This is verbatim from the box info screen, and works in reverse as well; when new reward types come out on previously completed categories come out, rewards of all other types will decrease. Yes power points and gold will show the dominant effect because their initial weight is so high to begin with, but it is not *100%* of the effect.

worked out with the coins for me cause now i have a lvl 9 colt

Lone Star to me does have a skill point, about picking battle or going for the highest star brawler. Meanwhile Takedown as a game mode overall should be gone-- not only in power play.
---
he is already good

Well i bought him before he was 80 games so :p

No,just waitüòÇ

drop the "Petition for" and replace "to" with "should" then its a meme

yes rank 3 carl with 2 trophies

bruh I have him still hard

Your wrong

Takedown is for fighting each other

Showdown is for teaming

Duh a lot of diffrense

The things that are required to play those game modes 1 luck 2 a crap ton of luck 3 a shipment of luck

stop self-promoting u scum

Guys you don‚Äôt need to judge the new one based off of details, it‚Äôs a concept of how they can fix it which they nailed

Mortis be like:Don't u dare touch my magnificent shovel

This sub be like
---
Uvbibhh jjfdbn n klo
---
What did they do to improve it? I have just about every brawler above rank 20 but I still get just as many people who find a corner and spam attacks so they don't get AFK kicked. Even in power plays.
---
Max is not on this list, she‚Äôs in another, and her name was Speedy
---
Takedown mostly, the originals in takedown tho were pretty fine. But theyre just not optimized for traveling to the bot without having to go through 6 different brawlers
---
Whr tf did u find me drom dude
---
In my opinion, he's only useless when you're using coiled snake unless you plan to self pass.
---
Since a good Mortis dosen't rely on it.
---
(:

I wish it were kids. Idk about this game, but adults are entitled as heck about anything where they've spent money irl, so I bet the same happens in this game too.

---
I was trying to make Mortis shovel... It did turn out like... I don't know...
---
YES! AND THE BEST PART IS "THE BOT SAYS IT ISN'T" SO THEY AREN'T EVEN REPOSTS!!! WTF PLS STOP WITH "repost" guys!! Come on, and even if it Is a repost WHATEVER JUST DONT UPVOTE AND IGNORE THE POST OR DOWNVOTE IT
---
What do you mean? Piper gave the ball to Shelly and used her super, the Shelly was probably furiously tappithe fire button so as soon as she got the ball she threw it
---
Have all brawlers unlocked and the star powers are still hard to come by. At this point it's better to save brawl boxes for new brawlers than trying to unlock star powers. And the star powers rarely go on sale at the shop. The drop rate needs to be increased especially when the only items you can get from brawl boxes after unlocking all brawlers and having them at power 9 at least you would think the drop rate for star powers will go up.
---
Me too
---
Actually Mortis isn't useless in defenses, he can defend hitting the wall, and, when the enemy shot he can dash to the ball
---
Your also not seriously about spelling correct
---
What the hell is this post
---
he vibin thoüò≥
---
I was in the middle of pipers grenade and it didn‚Äôt hit me
---
I think probably Thursday since brawl stars still isn‚Äôt letting youtubers show off max yet so videos of her will probably come out tomorrow. It just wouldn‚Äôt make sense for the update to come out the same day as the videos when everyone can have access to her.
---
Wow Mortis is OP, pls nerf.
---
Haha thanks
---
That one guy who got his account stolen should try to contact with support.
---
I'm just hoping it's tomorrow. I can wait till Thursday but I'm having a hard time not opening my boxes.
---
so many bee puns
---
"He" is for boy ," she" is for girl
---
Ya ya ya
---
If you are saying that it's more skill dependent than luck dependent then you're delusional. I enjoy these modes, but they are not fair
---
I mean... maybe they made them in the dark. The poco is like heavy metal poco lol
---
preetty much all 1vs1 game modes, maybe the duo showdown as well, they always f*** up my power rankings :(
---
Max boosts other brawlers in a small radius when he uses his super too
---
My friend didn't have one untill 15k
---
&gt;Luck only comes in takedown and lone star
---
Bounty too, you could get lucky by having a random with circling eagle which benefits a lot
---
Gem grab, you could get lucky the enemy gem carrier dies on your side
---
Brawl ball, lucky the ball went through the mortis who was dashing and into the goal
---

JK boi lol
---
really i dont care what brawlers people choose for brawl ball. it matters if they are good or not.
---
Ya I feel that. Was hoping for today. Being today is my day off. But obvi not happening. Really want it to drop. Sitting on a maxed account. There‚Äôs not really anything left for me to do rather than just keep pushing. I‚Äôm not really a big pusher. I have a select few that I really love to play that I will push. But imo to push all brawlers up there for them only to be reset and do over and over. I just don‚Äôt have that time.
---
pretty sure they said that they won't extend the throphy road
---
All of you who are self righteus to dissagree, mind that there are 8 mora brawlers than last year, and that all of them have 2 star powers. And the chances stayed the same.
---
Know its true
---
Even as a glitch,we still need it in the game.
---
Oh boy, do I have the youtuber for you
---
Watch KairosTime, I recommend being subscribed and watching his videos, they help with gameplay and specific character (brawler) tips. Check out him and Lex, there are some others too.

Pro here. I am sorry about that. I won about 7 in a row on a certain map using a dash tactic, and I have yet to see more than 1-2 other people pull it off. Takes nerve and patience, but a heart of yolo. A walking contradiction that works, if you will.
---
i play mortis in brawl ball because i really enjoy playing him and im actually having fun. they probably dont pick mortis because they think they are ‚Äúpros‚Äù, or what ever youre calling it, theyre probably just trying to have a good time playing a game

Mom
---
not that bad but still needs work especially the red and yellow lines
---
It's more skill dependent than Solo SD for sure, but i still find it less enjoyable to play due to a narrower meta, also the maps are too big
---
Plot twist
---
Bea currently at hospital.
---
*Sad Spike noise
---
Great video! :)
---
These channels should burn in hell
---
I believe it also means the player is the same level of trophies as the rest.
---
hahaha that combines perfectly when someone is happy and others are not
---
/WHERE'S THE LAMB SAUCE MATE?!/
---
Yeah, when I first heard of it I thought it was a terrible strategy. Turns out the person with the highest trophies as of one month ago in Pam used solely this strategy in Takedown.
---
Its like her eyes is drawed with pencil, lol
---
They need to fire whoever makes the icons üòÇ
---
My comment was not to insult pros,WHO ACTUALLY CAN CRUSH WITH MORTIS,nor stupid n00bs,who watch,and think"i can du it izili tu"And leave you 2 v 3 ,and charge enemy super,and the worst ones if this mortis let tara,or frank charge super.
---
Duo lonestar would be something glorious tbh
---
Not sure but I got you
---
Gems- premium currency in the game. Can be gotten from boxes and are used to buy skins or boxes and similar stuff
---
Star points - more like an end game thing, no need to worry about it now. It's used to buy skins at the end of each season, also big and mega boxes. You can get it from ranking up brawlers to 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35. Or by playing the Power Play game mode
---
*WHERE'S THE LAMB SAUCE MATE?!*
---
It's really good
---
*pulls up glasses*
---
you fell right into my trap!
---
Thanks dude! I hope I get statpowers some gold and maybe some gems but if I got a brawler then holy shit.. Ill owe it to you
---
I played him once and beat him, so I am undefeated against him üòÇ
---
I also like that you replied back to 98% of the commentsüòä
---
You are right, but we have to compare the time needed for these 3 shots (and only if the 3 shots hit, if you always miss the charged shots it will charge up way slower). 
---
I am a decent Piper player, yet it is very hard to hit consecutive shots, even with pipers faster unload shot. 
---
I get that the super is there for Bea to hit them easier but as far as I could tell in the sneak peak's the enemies will be walking in normal speed probably even before she can fire her second shot.
---
Lets wait and see
---
What? We've had a slew of trophy road brawlers. It's about time we've had rarer brawlers.
---
You'll get it when you're older
---
Everytime someone chooses mortis in bb, the team has to carry him so yeah, that's funny for you but not for your teammates.
---
*slowly laughs*
---
It would seem that way, hmm?
---
9k and a legendary thinking of quitting interesting i started in april and i still dont have any legendaries goodluck man
---
Please don‚Äôt self-promote yourself on this subreddit, it‚Äôs just a waste of time and it‚Äôs not allowed. Go check the subreddit rules.
---
fuck u. If u dont know how to play him it doesnt mean he is bad "its not about the car, its about the driver"
---
Oh that's really interesting. I would think that they'd try to find a same trophy match for each player so that it averaged out, but now that I think about it, the playerbase is probably to small for advanced matchmaking like that. I always thought having a team would be an advantage because of coordination, but I guess there actually is a downside to it.
---
Oh don‚Äôt be like that! Don‚Äôt ruin this tender moment with such vile thoughts!
---
Mhm! People like being noticed
---
yeah pretty much
---
*gonna just take a second here to mention that I absolutely hate whenever this happens in anime; just fucking fight already, we know you wan‚Äôt to stretch the episode out*
---
Hey i never said you HAD to be p2w
---
*insert blinking guy meme*
---
And special deal but one get one for the same price but we take it away
---
Nice, someone caught it!

But that aside, great art!

*sounds good to me bro*

MUDA MUDA MUDA
---
Supercell still wont ban people like this because they 'might have been having connection issues'.
---
Oh nuu
---
Shit I spelled it wrong:  r/unnecessaryapostrophe
---
Ah okay
---
Lol would it be legal for me to do that?
---
World War Bea
---
***MUDA MUDA MUDA***
---
I got my last legendary just right before this update which was sandy so I have saved 92
---
Bea is too pretty for pain, bucko
---
770 but I got bored and opened 60 of them.
---
so i can still swear out on my friends for choosing mortis in heist?
---
Bruh
---
#WRRYYYY
---
Big thank
---
Yaes iet iz
---
yeah some people actually want to enjoy playing. there is nothing wrong with that. it only matters if they are decent, or they are trying to win. you should really think before comenting. and it is ironic when the mortis is the one carrying, doesnt it?
---
Frrrr, I have two friends who got like three of them super early but I have none
---
Wow, you must have been maxed out for a while.
---
Ahah, no bro, we‚Äôre Ukrainians and Russians. Hello, neighbour).
---
I bet that Bea‚Äôs second star power helps a lot in this scenario. It has to bea.
---
Colt's my favorite
---
No. It has been pulled off before. It wasn‚Äôt a friendly match
---
–°–ö–ê –ë–õ–Ø–¢–¨
---
That's true. If you take your friend with 200 trophies and power 2 into a match at 600 trophies, then you are giving EVERYONE in your team a disadvantage, and that's even more annoying for the random you and your friend play with.
---
Also, when you play in an organized team you are very likely to face another organized team.
---
So cute! Great artwork
---
vietnam flashback
---
Well I still need 2 legendarys. I didnt expect to save up for so long, but they kept releasing trophy road brawlers so I had no need to open them.
---
I would! 
---
Also, I have a question for you; are you in KairosTime‚Äôs discord server?
---
I disagree, open areas are crucial when the boss is furious, the water sucks as you‚Äôll be getting caught on it and it limits where you can run to, it allows snipers to gang up on you and it‚Äôll be harder to avoid the lasers and missiles. In an open area you have all the space needed to run clockwise for the lasers and it‚Äôs easier to take out any snipers without the water interfering.
---
Who am I? Who am I? What are you even saying?! I‚Äôm the winner of the game you‚Äôre accidentally playing!
---
jojoooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

SYKA BLYAT

It was already viable? Whatchu mean?

lmaoooo
---
Great fucking job
---
It‚Äôd be cool if I could give away skins I don‚Äôt want or be able to exchange them for gems or something from other players. Your idea is cool, I‚Äôd assume they‚Äôd take away another ability since you‚Äôre adding a new one to the brawler in order for it not to be too much p2w. As they say.
---
Great job. I think this would be a good rework
---
Four
---
Or maybe the update will be tomorrow but only Bea will be released and Max later after some days
---
If they will want this I will make a petition to make skins or gems cheaper üòâ
---
It looks like el primo with a mask tho
---
I‚Äôm not gonna enjoy a BB game having to carry Mortis. He ain‚Äôt doing shit as soon as Shelly, Bibi and friends hit the map.
---
Probably will be changed just ass piper
---
oH i forgot
---
lol why I got downvoted
---
Nah, they will be released at the same time. I think they would have told us if they will be released separately.
---
Rico is high af
---
pam is terrifying

What's your accounts name?

Flair checks out

The old one looks obnoxious and has Cal Arts vibes.
---
There is normal and big hit box I seen Bibi w/ energy charge through without getting hit
---
LOL EW
---
Brock should be the soldier, tick should be the demoman (in terms of mechanics)
---
Supercell pls add market gardening to brawl stars
---
So many brawlers looking at Piper's... (insert word here)
---
He never referred to her as male
---
I think maybe skins will need challenges to do to unlock abilities. It would be more nice
---
.26 havnt gotten a legend since Leon came out and I got him 16 days after
---
Charge through what exactly?
---
I know this is not the best example but it‚Äôs made sense in my mind at the time
---
Oh yeah what role would you put piper in?
---
People in the comments not big brain
---
Well there is night WITCH mortis
---
BibiR
---
The nades
---
Might be my wall paper
---
I have nothing to gain from lying, and a lot of credibility to lose. Besides, Even if Supercell doesn't let me release a Max Sneak Peek before the update drops, I would be a fool to not release a video on her after the update drops.
---
There will be a Max video some time
---
And I thought a free for all + boss fight mode would be fun
---
r/wholesomebrawlstars
---
Damm, all these bad randoms were actually mirrors?
---
That explains a lot
---
Wtf there's nothing there. And even it there was, is definitely because of 2019
---
And that's a fact
---
Gottem ;D
---
Con que hablas espa√±ol y ves √Ålvaro
---
I go into more details in the video, but her reload speed is the same whether or not her next attack is supercharged.
---
In other words, her reload speed is longer than it takes for Bea's attack to reach max range. So your next ammo won't be reloaded until the game knows if it should supercharge it
---
Hey karios.. how do you rate Bea?
---
Overwatch bad
---
Thank you! Yeah, everyone's been talking about the sticker thing
---
Plus the second star power
---
Why not? What‚Äôs wrong with it?
---
Thank you!
---
Thank you!!!
---
What about primo
---
and star player goes to.....
---
Scrappy for killing 11 gems bull in the last red count down
---
I dont see the problem
---
Uh so retarded it hurts
---
That‚Äôs seven words smh
---
I just got a star power today after about 3 weeks. Unfortanately it was just creepy harvest and I still need like 8 more star powers
---
r/thebrawlstarsbee

I dont know... that's a hard one.

THIS IS JUST SO CUTE!!! My heart üíì

Si vorrei dei ettoni grazie arrivederci

Why are the icons recently so ugly

I have seen all blues, and all pinks, maybe some blues with pinks, but never this.
---
A s G o l d

Yes!
---
Darryl is hiding before Shelly uses her SOUP!
---
Just add a hash tag to the beginning of whatever you are typing
---
still open?
---
You're crazy
---
YES! She is an adorable chunky little thing
---
I‚Äôll try!
---
As it should be
---
Yeah true, we can only wait and see. I think he said it takes 3 shots regardless if whether it's supercharged or not. But yeah, just got to wait and see!
---
first see how funny is and how people play it.. because could happen the same thing with Lonestar and Takedown
---
This is what changes we need in these gamemodes
---
Although I seldom play LS,but playing TD can make me felt furustarting,last time when my 8-bit was at 1147,I when I get to the bot,it ran away.It just keep running away or just got a shelid before I can deal any single damage.This situation make me drop 26 trophies in 2 games and I didn't play any takedown after that
---
I bought that and the best I got was 3 gems
---
Crow
---
That green thing is kinda ugly, I think without could look better
---
Ah, yes. Cro.

Please do! We want to see a lil (toxic) birby, okay?
