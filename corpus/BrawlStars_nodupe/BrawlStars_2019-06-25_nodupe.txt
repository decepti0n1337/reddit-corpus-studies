how do you get that CUSTOM BRAWLER BESIDES YOUR NAME

I've seen 10 Primo-with-10-gems posts on ny way down here and you choose to link it here.
---
They could have 2 star powers but you can only use one at a time so the new brawler would just have 1 star power and in the next update it will get another one
---
If youre good you can just walk up to enemies juking their shott
---
Ok
---
true.

Your Mom must be so proud of you, such a mature human being

no shelly is fine

Dude, first off, my post is different from u/Sector03 's post. He said Carl's, Penny's and Rico's Star Powers are Robo Retreat, Protective Pirouette, and Balls of Fire respectively. I said They were Protective Pirouette, Balls of Fire and Robo Retreat respectively. 
---
Second off, I SAID I didn't repost Sector's post IN THE FRICKING TITLE AND THR FRICKING COMMENTS.
---
next time please üëÄ harder before you call someone out, okay?
---
Yes You TOUGH GUY
---
if there is just one more ammo slot i think that would be fine. it would improve your burst but not how often you can shoot rockets or anything like that.
---
It might be, and if it is I‚Äôll assure you I won‚Äôt cry over itüåà

I can‚Äôt speak to clash royale because I don‚Äôt play it...but think about it this way. In boom beach or coc, most people only battle once or twice and then they‚Äôre done for a while because armies have to be trained. In brawl stars, you can battle constantly. It‚Äôs also live combat which puts more strain on the servers(lag is still a serious problem). The number of replays being saved and replayed would be massive if everyone had access to them. I‚Äôd rather they make the servers more stable and fix lag and disconnect issues before people get access to replays at low levels. Does this suck for lower ranked brawlers? Yeah. Of course. But it shouldn‚Äôt be a priority right now.
---
Bones need milk; so poco had too much milk
---
Yes yes yes!
---
Hmmm... maybe supercell is giving us weaker star powers that u can get earlier on, but have the lvl 10 ones more powerful. From that, I would say supercell wants this star power to be a surprise.
---
Best is root
---
I think that star power has to do with Tara. People have been saying buff Tara and to give her a remodel, they might have done all of that but plus a new start power. This could definitely be a possibility though.
---
Regular emotes would have a 10 second recharge time

Yes, it's like the most wide open map on in the game except maybe dry season

---
Mortis... you are better than this...
---
yeah if you know where it's planted. if you activate it and if it damages you bo will most likely come out of the bushes and kill you. and its only "dodgable" if you are playing against an auto aimer or if you're far away from him.

Just wanted to say if you were considering me, I was once a mod at r/ElPrimoGang r/BoGang and r/RosaOpGang so you can ask the mods there about me if you want more information about how good I will do.
---
Why do ppl still use this joke
---
Sponge: Frank turns into a sponge, that's all.
---
I don‚Äôt think putting effort in could be worse than this.
---
I feel like a 4th rocket for brock is way too OP.  I think the fouth rocket has less damage or has less range for example. If it actually is then RIP.
---
It was definitely deleted from the news sidebar (not sure if you were just looking through there or deeply searching through the app history), but the 2nd highest damage she did was 525 when attack was maxed out.   
---
Back then you could choose which part of a brawler you wanted to upgrade. You could upgrade their HP, Attack, or Super. It was done through an elixir system, which you could get from brawl boxes. Using Piper at base stats as an example, let's say you wanted to invest elixir on her, you decided to upgrade her super. This would make her super do more damage per grenade (200 --&gt; 205) while her HP and attack remain the same (600 HP, 440 at maxed range.) But the thing is, my original statement would only be true if the Ricochet had base or had his HP upgraded only once. If his HP was any higher, then the statement would be false
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
TL;DR Balance note got deleted/buried, most vivid memory was her maxed out attack at 525 + explanation of old upgrading system and how it applies to the original statement.

I like that one too, along with the rest of the epics. Especially **S P O N G E**.
---
Yeah sure
---
did it in big game and trolled everyone for 15 seconds
---
Goals scored doesn‚Äôt affect star player, it‚Äôs purely damage inflicted/kills.
---
You're right, but even if you get 400 trophies with some brawler you'll see that practically every match will be brawlers with star power

Because I have to wait for a long time in order to enter the match in that map... The waiting time is too long and I just want that Star Token... It is fun but too less players play the map

I would actually like this if they did this with every brawler as a joke

I need coins. I need to upgrade most of my brawlers and cannot afford to upgrade most of them.

Well if you put each of The rarities (not trophy road) have 4 Brawlers except for Mythic and Legendary. So I‚Äôm thinking we are going to get the Mythic Brawler (Kinda guaranteed at this point), and then either a Trophy Road Brawler (at 4000 trophies) then followed by a Legendary Brawler or Vice Versa
---
Sounds good LOL :)

I'm I've not seen it, my bad

I hate this meme template

Sometimes offers have different prices, eg. a few days ago I could buy 220 power points for 29 gems. The next day or two a new offer appeared - 220 power points for 39 gems.

It might be confusing, but check the strikethrough price, as it should be 45 gems instead of 50 (in both cases you have the same value for Token Doublers)

No. Blame supercell for thinking this is acceptable. If high trophy dude wants to play with low trophy friend, he should get a 3rd low trophy player and be matched against 3 people in the highest trophy range.

Happy cake day!
---
Yup iam Ready
---
Some guy literally bush camped his way to top 100. Trophies doesn't equal skill. It's rather obvious by how they play some of the brawlers. That's not to say they're terrible they just aren't too exceptional
---
This kid got baited hard
---
You got mythixs before the legendaries, that's actually kinda lucky in terms of how it affects the pity timer.
---
Bull super is one of the worst if not the worst. The maximum distance is useful only in escaping. But reaching brawlers to attack them is hard using the super most of the time because super end away from them .
---
In late showdown games, you can not use it (to interrupt Frank super for example) because that means you will end up in the green poison
---
You can not use to when someone is kiting you around walls, since you will end up too far away from him. While Elprimo will simply jump on the other side of the wall, landing next to that brawler
---
And many others situation where you want to shorten the super distance to make it effective.
---
Happens üòÇ
---
Piper is just aiming and strategizing + aiming your super for your convenience 
---
So yeah piper is pretty hard to play since you have to aim in a specific way to hit people
---
No, I just made another account.

Of course when you play on 130 trophies

Makes sense, I didn't think of that

Nope, he didn't stole it, it's actually his own artwork.

His name is Joy Nigam, his signature may not look like it, but the one on [this drawing](https://i.redd.it/xptyvcyd1tz21.jpg) does looks like it says "Joy Nigam", and if you compare both signatures, they look alike.
---
Or Super could be rework like this:
---
When Bull uses his super, brawler got hit in super path, will be pushed in front of bull, to land on the end of Bull super.
---
Think of it as Gene super opposite. Instead of pulling brawler, you are pushing brawler.
---
With this rework, you will not worry about being far from brawler when the super if finished.

Yes.

I'm on my mini and this is the first time I've experienced as such although I have seen such posts on reddit already. I'm couldn't see if she threw the first goal too by own goaling/not defending as I was on respawn timer, but I can say with absolute certainty that she own goaled the second goal. Me and Jesse just squad wiped and I moved forward, only to see Piper take the ball and walk backwards, then ending in an own goal. If by any chance the Piper was pissed off at us for being noob, I can only say that my main was 12k with 23/26 (I play much more on my mini now), and I've had a couple of 600s (not very impressive still though), so if anyone in the team should be complaining about noob teammates, it would be me.

Yeah...i see so many notifications...and u forgot to collect your free brawl stars reward...go collect them before it disappears...
---
Yellow one probably brock btw jus look at it for 5 seconds
---
The game is 2 years old, and there is no July update
---
That's pretty fast
---
22/10
---
Maybe try playing a solo with leon and watch everyone team with each other and not with you and every single guy chasing you
---
Transformer crow
---
I think el primo or Bo
---
Yes, so
---
Of course you didn‚Äôt
---
Piper most likely ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
No I mean 2 years after Global Release and who knows, I mean they've been updating every month so yea.
---
Go into r/brawlstars, press the 3 dots in the top left, press ‚Äúedit user flair‚Äù and pick a brawler
---
Could be anything but look he has like somthing on his arm which im preeetty sure are his rockets
---
Look now
---
sence o saƒüdaki ikisi crow ve bo olabilirmi ???
---
Who knows
---
Hmmm true ye
---
I would like that
---
Yup brawl talk in 43 mins
---
Well seems related since he has high hp like el primo soaking damage üòÇ
---
You have 100 % charge ... Wow thats amazing .... I'm stuck at 22%üò•
---
Yeah but im very sure no one wants a new brock skin XD

I just realized that these are Crow and bo‚Äô Skin..‚Äô

üçüüçüüçüüçü–ë–ª—ç—Ç
---
Is it released yet or am I blind
---
People argue she‚Äôs the worst brawler in the game lmao
---
Brawl stars collaboration with transformers lol
---
Lmao
---
23/10
---
You‚Äôre welcomeü§£
---
Bg?
---
Go to Brawl Stars channel 
---
You gonna shocked after seeing
---
Lol didnt notice, im glad
---
No shut up your breathtaking!
---
hmmm good catch
---
then why do you want rewards !? for what?!
---
For a second i though the new skin on brock is that black screen at the end of the post.
---
I mean, yeah, it sounds bad, but I managed to get a really god time.
---
I dont wanna see showwdown after relase üòÇ
---
AFAIK they are going to be /additional/ star powers that you will be able to choose between, rather than star powers that replace the old ones.
---
Didn't he say, "starting at 150"? Didn't mention Crow specifically...
---
Why not?
---
WOW WHAT A ORIGINAL IDEA!
---
as if nobody else was thinking that
---
I‚Äôd open it now, yeah
---
They might add remodels and voices with the update but decided not to talk about it on the Brawl talk
---
Yes
---
Please apologize to yourself, YOU'RE BREATHTAKING!
---
Brawl talk just came out!!
---
1. I was right that Well Oiled is for the new brawler.
---
2. I was right that Pat on the back is for Gene, because at 1:53 in the video you see him heal his allies with his hand.
---
I don't know about Mortis and Tara.
---
Supercell has left the chat
---
Between a cover of a book
---
Reported
---
That's endgame
---
brb need to make this into his voice lines
---
Im sorry thy good sir you are breathtaking
---
Cuz they arent that cancerous as throwers
---
the new skins will be very confusing for new players facing them in showdown for the first time lol
---
Sorry I meant Mortis
---
Open it!
---
Its pronounced "Fidget Spinner" Duhh
---
When you look at it that way, you get 1 garunteed brawler vs some power points, gold, and the slim chance to get a new brawler. That's a better trade off now that I think about it.
---
New brawler is free if you are over 4k trophies
---
Yes but its always lying
---
For brawlers over 500 trophies
---
That‚Äôs endgame content
---
Omg this time it‚Äôs a HUGE update !!!! I can‚Äôt wait! This Bo skin will be mine !
---
That crow skin was someone‚Äôs skin idea
---
wtf does the mega box at 4000k dissappear?
---
piper is actually pretty good in a few brawl ball maps
---
QUASANT
---
I was gonna say the same thing, only brawler I pushed to 500
---
Wtf
---
I v been waitin for Piper skins 4 soooo long and now we get third Crow skin and third mike skin
---
Why can‚Äôt you make a skin per week? It s not hard! Why can‚Äôt you release beautiful skins for our poor Tara and Piper. No need in remodel, just add some skins for them girls they deserve it. 
---
I do not like Transformers and I‚Äôm not happy with those skinsüôÑ We girls too play BS and none of us like robots I suppose
---
üò•
---
You first
---
Leave Reddit
---
Ahh. But this post isn't relates to the new brawler tho. I'm also quite sad they nerfed this.
---
For my free to play players why else?
---
They'll work just like the current Star Powers. But newer, shinier, and OP-ier.
---
Dunno it landed on my front page lol.
---
The most fucking underrated, WILL KIDS EVEN GET THIS JOKE?
---
#MEGA ULTRA THICC
---
Love you Ryan ‚ô•Ô∏è
---
I say 300
---
are you gonna finish that QUASSO ?
---
You were saying?
---
?
---
##TINK
---
Thats a if mate
---
Then why are YOU complaining
---
Nah i don't spread cancer like supercell do
---
Probably. I‚Äôd open it to be safe
---
oh shit what have i done
---
new star powers similar as the one bibi has for every brawler in the game
---
Here's one line to help you: I'm thicc!!!
---
^^thats ^^better
---
It's just you.
---
They don‚Äôt always reveal remodels in brawl talks.  It could still be happening!
---
Good use to the memeüëè
---
But its a fact that YOU are breathtaking
---
Ma siete italiani come me?
---
this will be so op lol, why would anyone choose the other star power over this one
---
oh...
---
WOW
---
you were fast as fck boiiii
---
When bibi used her super she also used her normal attack and didnt lose her knockback charge.
---
In the bull clip you can see pams super have more range
---
You are all breathtaking !
---
Omg that would be awesome. Someone know sum about skin prices?
---
Very welcome
---
Are we seriously gonna make a stupid thread out of this but still your breathtaking
---
Ah yes the seat leon, the car that can go invisible anytime and cause a massive horde of accidents
---
Remember when Colt and Poco got a remodel? No one expected it until Youtubers got the dev build. So it might be the case with Tara and Piper being remodeled.
---
Well, how do you know if he did it on purpose?
---
#MEM3Z&lt;WINS
---
But I never conflicted in any of those!!
---
They start at 150 they said so i think dyna and spike will be much more
---
r/TickGang
---
Ok since your a complete idiot and I have to spell it out for you, I have a big clan pushing top 200 in America so I have friends who are free to play, I want better trophy road system for them so they get more boxes and can max out easily. I complain for them since they don‚Äôt use Reddit anything else you want to say broke boi?
---
Yep. They trolled us.
---
Wasn't talking to you sorry.
---
lmao
---
Get star power, and roll to stun enemy attacks.
---
**yes**
---
Just shut up and say thanks , you think it's easy to run a game
---
It‚Äôs just what people like stop being an entitled jerk. We all deal with that
---
Tick is my name, making Bo's super obsolete is my game
---
Gedi-kor should be credited a little for mecha ideas.
---
89 days? it‚Äôs 67 days until summer is over. July and August. Don‚Äôt know where the hell you got 89 days.
---
nani dino
---
Note that the flavor text for Star Points also mentions that you earn Star Points along with Season End Rewards as well as Brawler Rank-ups.
---
Do I have to win those new star powers to the same brawler or When i get the star power it comes with the option to change to others?
---
Hey man, your so mature!
---
‚Äúu‚Äù ‚Äúb4‚Äù ‚Äúyats‚Äù. How old are you? Trying to mention congress doesn‚Äôt show that you‚Äôre sophisticated or anything. It just shows that you‚Äôre trying way too hard to prove a point
---
No, he means that we only will be able to get skins from offers in the shop and will have to be bought with gems
---
Oops I did not read your comment properly
---
No it doesnt
---
Thicck &gt; Thicco
---
thank
---
I mean I guess open now that we now it‚Äôs a trophy road lol
---
The Spike looked like Pikachu for a sec idk why
---
He'll probably be better tho cause of his AOE
---
I got skills to pay the bills
---
Removed. Keep your post titles descriptive and provide context. Additionally do not use low effort/all caps/clickbait titles.
---
finally, an indirect buff to mortis
---
Just facts
---
Spudow Tick New idea
---
Nice 1
---
Yes, we all saw the Brawl Talk, you didn't need to post it...
---
‚úÖ I am not a human
---
Perfect just Perfect üëå
---
Or he has just the actual one equiped
---
lol he fucking sucks then
---
Then delete them wtf
---
Thank you so much dude, you're comparing my pixel art to undertale that's a great honour!!.
---
My phone broke too!!
---
Get to 4k before tick is out and you can get a mega box and tick
---
Let's be honest, who wouldn't?
---
dont be stereotypical. I think that this brawler has a bit of backstab value because he can throw down the mines into the other throwers ajd they will explode right away
---
So did Dynamike
---
Tick is my name and bombing is my game
---
Life leech AHEM
---
ü§£
---
Oh my stars
---
Horrible pun sorry
---
I saw you on Korean Brawl Talk!!! (Woo said "pls put Ryan away" )
---
Anyway is Tara remodel real??? I can't wait for it!
---
Wdym Mortis Can Just Dash Over Tick's Mines.
---
yes. its normal. i got my first mythic at 9k trophies
---
And Mortis 3 Shots Tick.
---
Pls translate
---
He's into those leather jackets you know
---
&gt; _I mean we cold too, bit we are totally not going to do anything_
---
LMAO
---
You could live a nice translation in an English subreddit :/
---
But they had to announce Bo remodel?
---
Not really I thought that joke kind of bombed.
---
I got nothing good from this box sooo. Let it die, let it die
---
"Mecha" is a common topic, and every generic tbh
---
Not like they took the idea from him. Is just a common topic
---
Everyone is talking about Brock's fourth ammo slot, but why is no one talking about Poco's fourth ammo slot? If you look at Poco's clip, you can see an extended ammo bar, similar to Brock's, so Poco will also be getting a fourth ammo bar.
---
FBI open up!
---
O sh*t I just realised
---
Yeah I was thinking that too. They‚Äôre teasing the new star powers so it wouldn‚Äôt make much sense but that definitely could be the care
---
No tell me
---
We all saw them, you didn't need to post them.
---
you should wait for the same offer again with the same amount of price but it gives 1000 instead.
---
Bibi have no nose. But it is a really good art!
---
In the new shop we will still be able to get power points for gold or getting the free daily item?
---

This is gold. üëèüëè

Wow if that‚Äôs what u think then u got a lot of growing up to do lolüòÇ I wasn‚Äôt trying to act ‚Äúsophisticated‚Äù I mentioned Congress kuz I actually read about it.. I‚Äôm 26 btw.. the only reason I asked for your age is kuz u might not even know what games used to cost  and the transition that happened after mobile gaming and in app purchases..
---
So? There's bigger stuff than a remodel this update. For example, star powers
---
r/shittybrawlstars
---
bo is bumblebee 
---
dyna is like hammod (wreaking ball ) from overwatch
---
For all those asking for translation, if im not wrong, its:
---
"Come, let uncle check your body"
---
"Come, let brother check your temperature."
---
"Come, let sister check your length."
---
Rule of the internet: Anyone who mentions their age, isn‚Äôt that age.
---
The Talk is out but not the update.
---
When‚Äôs it going live
---
OMG I just find out that I can delete my posts...
---
I am the dumbest Reddit user ever :(((
---
How long until the patch release
---
What you get
---
Just like the school besides my house lol. It blew up last week
---
New brawler is a thrower Mortis:üòè
---
Follow Frank@Supercell(https://mobile.twitter.com/Frank_Supercell/with_replies).He replied to someone about 10 days ago.
---
I know But I Mean That New bralwer will be very weak against assasins
---
Is this ironic?
---
But why mecha? Like I guess me ha bull comes in mind the most I guess...
---
He dose look like a pirate
---
Guess Who an idiot?
---
Look at whos Ryan pointing at
---
Ok thanks!
---
If you stop slowly, if I am not mistaken, the super de Bo are not mines, but rather a typical trap for animals
---
Really?
---
Yeah, just like every other thrower.
---
I'm the only one who prefers Spike?
---
But she does not need rework... just vo and any skin. She look good as she is
---
Well k then
---
"Announced". It is never announced officially...
---
Maybe for protective pirouette some damage is reduced when Carl uses super?
---
EELLLLLLLLLL..... JOJOOOOOO.....
---
True, hopefully the other brawlers also got remodels.
---
No..it happens only for brawlers with 500 trophies.
---
Suppose...I have a brawler with 600 trophies and rest all are below 500.
---
After season reset...the brawler will drop 50% trophies above 500 = 550 now.
---
So...you will get 50 star points for the trophies dropped.
---
Hope u understand. üòä
---
As soon as I saw this in the brawl talk I knew it‚Äôd become a meme format.
---
No looks like the world
---
#I dEaDaSs DoN't KnOw WhAt To sAy
---
yeah, it is 11 days. i went reserved army training in last week. thanks for waiting me
---
this is way better than most of the other memes. i mean half of them dont even make sense.
---
It's quite balanced.
---
#....... .... ....... ..... ..... ....... ..... ....
---
No, idiot! It's Karen McLairosTime Gaming!
---
Tick equals thicc
---
:)
---
niCe hEadShoT
---
Bouncer = Rico, Rosa = Jawbreaker, barely = pop fizz, Leon = stealth elf, mortis = night shift, dynamike = boomer, Brock = zook, Carl = dinorang, el primo = terrafin, Jessie = sprocket.
---
I thought the same.
---
Omg yes i'm so close to 11k on my main and just got to 4K on my mini that would be the absolute perfect combo for me xD
---
It‚Äôs a place holder üò™
---
True for me
---
Cuz I got all 3 mythic from regular box
---
Still a bunch of pp and gold.
---
They can always buff it or Nerf it as per results what's the issue.
---
No no I thought so at the beginning but check out that description it says from brawler Rank up also and Ryan also said that.
---
Yeah, I believe she says it at random during battle or after getting a kill
---
On the bright side mortis gets a huge buff with the addition of another thrower
---
Yeah the color misread most of ppl
---
Its just like idk beta tests so they just used that i think
---
Well there are color options
---
Shelly has a bar like Bibi that slowly fills up (probably ends up healing her)
---
Poco‚Äôs super probably deals damage
---
Carl‚Äôs super breaks walls
---
Ryan mention that they will remodel tara
---
Free brawler is much more worth than a mega box. Sad to see it go for newer players, but it‚Äôs for the best.
---
The one riochan made sticks better to the original character, i mean guess crow is alright but I can't even recognize bo.
---
Y is she wearing shorts and a shirt/sweater that is not all the way down
---
But it clearly says you can get them from brawler rank ups
---
You get him right away
---
So what lightning effects would you want if he was added into the game?
---
A bob-omb + Chain chomp hybrid
---
But when?
---

Dude nice
---
I'll do you one better: Who is brawl talk
---
Open it
---
Would there still be a reason to use the old star powers or would they work together?
---
I have 25 brawlers at rank 20. Will I get Star Points for that too?
---
It‚Äôs a canary
---
I think he meant they were all lvl 10
---
Looks like the best update in a long time. Thank you to the Supercell Brawl Stars team!
---
It disappear
---
Your skin ideas are inspiring new skin in games keep it up
---
I think I will, but may I use the info from this post?
---
oh ok
---
So there Will be nothing but that new guy for a while? Well I guess ill be raging again...
---
ok i've watched it, you can eat me now
---
Well at least I don't have to conserve boxes
---
I drew that on another paper but it really didn‚Äôt look right due to Rosa having loose and comfortable clothing
---
Does that on coach cory's video say "TINK?"
---
Maybe you're right ü§î That would suck
---
#No tara voice
---
#No tara remodel
---
Honestly Gedi-kor should take an idea for a skin and change the brawler that the skin is for so that supercell possibly adds the skin for the intended brawler to have even better skins
---
THE MAN IS BACK!
---
#But at least you have a n-word pass now
---
Ironic.
---
G
---
No l like your drawing and subscribe to your channel
---
Most Suck video for suck people to watch
---
My video sucks so it's for you to watch
---
We? Looks to me like you died and got carried...
---
What will be the price of spike's skin
---
Ryan do we need to buy a mecca skin in order to get the alternate color options for them through the star points or can F2P players still be able to unlock the skin variations?
---
Good thing I passed that milestone a while back. F's in the chat.
---
bro they clearly mentioned in  brawl talk that for brawlers over 500, there is nothing much to do so they are introducing a new currency. watch it again. its only for 500+
---
Cory and orange juice are not clickbait just straight and fair title.
---
Lex and kairos maybe a little bit but tbh they really show hidden things we missed so it's only fair.
---
1. don't spin after killing one brawler
---
2. shelly is trash
---
I don't remember.
---
But there is some post Ryan said it
---
#No random donkey kongs killing me thank god
---
Agreed. Seems like he's a viable choice for any game mode, very few weaknesses that I've spotted.
---
He's also Max...
---
*visible confusion*
---
#It's actually getting pretty annoying it was funny first few times
---
Haha, I'm at 383 and it sucks, very relatable
---
You have no choice but to go through the bush if you spawn on the outside.
---
Perhaps, but his bombs are proximity related. Just dump a ton of them around you and Mortis would be dashing to his doom.
---
#As heck
---
Does Mortis really? That super is impossible for Mortis to dodge. Plus he has good control around himself, which the other throwers don‚Äôt have.
---
Thks very much.
---
He aLsO sHoOtS cAcTuS iN tHe DeV bUiLd
---
open it now it will disappear
---
but yeah also there is a chance of getting some when brawler ranks up. for the complete satisfaction lol we have to wait till update comes. i think most probably it can be anyday before the coming monday.
---
Hey Gedi-Kor! Good to see you back again with another skin concept!
---
I knew how Supercell added in many Mecha-Skins for different Brawlers in the summer update, and unfortunately, they wouldn't add in yours, but personally, I feel like you yourself have done such a great work on coming up with these skins.
---
I hope to expect many more good skin ideas like this one in the future!
---
Fax
---
Well, there is nothing we can do about it if majority of the ppl enjoy those memes
---
Most skins added were suggested by someone before. This doesn‚Äôt mean supercell added it based on the community skins. This is very obviously the case here
---
Well put
---
This meme is literal shit.
---
Hopefully
---
Brock is the only brawler that i pushed to power 10 and now im haapy
---
You literally have no idea what's going on with the random, they could have had internet issues, or any myriad of other perfectly good excuses. I understand being annoyed that a random isn't good, but it takes it to the stupidest extreme possible to act like they're worthless. Please, grow up.
---
Summer is 2 months in one month we will get a new brawler
---
Tennisball tick
---
Literally didn't get a brawler from that box so i could care less lol
---
I am saying it has always controlled him
---
Same name, different design
---
He looks hollow inside actually
---
All spikes look kinda dead inside.
---
Ok, yeah you're right, I apologize
---
I‚Äôm sorry I didn‚Äôt think of crediting u.  I just saw ur comment and wanted to make a meme of it
---
100% relatable
---
Nooo lmao, these are the ytbers as brawlers lol
---
Wall knight is better, fight me

Besides Tick, why do I feel like this is a hoax? Mecha skins and 3 star powers a week??? Too good to be true.

I got Piper out of this box

Hey sector, when he comes out. Can you make him do the orange justice?

Very nice hacks
---
Why would they? Mecha skins are quite popular. Gedi didn't come up with the robot skins, SUPERCELL did
---
Lol true
---
Normal mike is controlled by the chick like in rattatoil that is why he has a chef skin it‚Äôs a joker
---
I opened that box last night and got no new brawlers üôÉ
---
Not sure but you should open it before update because if it just replaces 4k with the new brawler you'll miss out on that mega box just to be safe
---

I said your meme is r/shittybrawlstars material exactly *because* it makes fun of shitty memes, not because it‚Äôs shitty (‚Äòcause I don‚Äôt think it is)
---
I don't think a full-fledged mecha needs a bow...
---
Does he have legs?  I didn‚Äôt think he did
---
We talk about and only Brawl Stars here..... not Ratatouille or other stupid things.
---
Smfh.
---
I love that Gene meme template xD
---
Hopefully clubs and new game mode will be in our next big Update so probably December will be next big update
---
But I got Piper and Spike
---
ceck?
---
The good ol‚Äô days of Skylanders
---
Dinamike chef is controlled by the chick like in ratatouille mate I‚Äôm kidding
---
Oh sorry english is not my first language so it took me awhile to understand what you actually were trying to say
---
Are you saying tick can't check bushes?
---
hay day?
---
I hope it's not easily confused with Tick on the battlefield.
---
RYAN HIMSELF!

This is actually really good. Probably tastes good too. 10/10

Now we spend hundreds on Brawl Stars

Ryan thanks for doing brawl talk again

i like that not gonna lie

Thanks!  I may do colt next

Hopefully man! Clubs need a buff

Oh, I understand now üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ

thx!

eh, it‚Äôs alright :v

congrats on 10K

u/Ryan_Supercell
---
to be fair they cant put gedi\`s skins in game because they are copyright and they would have to pay for them
---
Supercell: Yes finally another skin idea that we can change a little bit and say it is our idea.
---
isn't this repost?
---
Again, I know what I said, and I know how I spelled it -3-

Ceck!!!!

Tick was leaked last year in the datamine... His name was cluster!
---
The *moral* is opposing you
---
ELECTRONZZZ
---
Do remember all the other clans in supercell games didn't get club events immediately. Right now clubs purpose bis to find skilled players to play with so you don't deal with randoms
---
You forgot TICK
---
When is the update droppig?
---
Yes, for 150 gems it says in brawl talk
---
And reworked a lot of time for "hoverboard" then "mr bomb" and then "tick"
---
Shhhhhh. Don‚Äôt remind Ryan
---
Its private server lel I have been on private server with thing what looked just like this
---
Welcome to the 10kclub

The transformers skins look Ugly to be honest. Sorry, ‚öÜ·óù‚öÜ (‡≤•Ôπè‡≤•)
---
Nope, it's Magna zone = rico
---
Yup that is true bro. Clan War came a year or 2 later, same with the perks and stuff in COC. So I'm guessing maybe a year after beta so around December?

You are most likely not able to get the new brawler if it was mythic. You will need more boxes than that.
---
He can
---
Now this does put a smile on my face
---
Crow = Free ranger
---
No remodel just a skin.Because we all know what will happen if she gets a remodel
---
#SheWillGetThicc
---
Also by the sneak peak he might have been planed on being mythic but they changed it. Or Supercel was just messing with us making us think he would be mythic
---
On a 1v1 battle without a single tile gap bull win and with 1 tile gap he can defeat any brawler except pam
---
*TINK*
---
The only brawlers I don't have skins for that have a skin available is Frank, Primo and Brock. I might buy el rudo before this change, but I don't want caveman bad enough to spend 80. And I just don't like Brock's that much, I'll wait for a sale of the retro skin. Probably should have bought the chinese new year one when it was discounted.
---
No no not like that! I meant some brawlers are being turned into robots and some robots like Barely, Darrell, And Tick are rebelling against them
---
I would hate it if it was only real money, tho.
---
Oh haha. I see :D
---
Ow
---
Out boi
---
I stealed it
---
Yes there will be part 2 about skins
---
He has his mouth open too..
---
No just no first off dead meme format and second that statement is so wrong
---
I liked it
---
new ui
---
Just climbed 100 trophies to get to 4k
---
People that haven‚Äôt claimed the 4K Mega Box, claim it now. When Tick is released, you‚Äôll get two rewards at 4K
---
What does this mean? Like we don't have to be Power 9, or is it rotational?
---
Who the hell are u ? ( i don‚Äôt wanna know )

NOT SO FAST: https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/c58bwt/taras_remodel_announced_in_korean_brawl_talk/?utm_source=reddit-android
---
Ive been waiting for a TR brawler, I was wondering if Supercell was ever going to release any more.
---
How do you know?
---
That gene template is goldüòÇüòÇ people should use it now
---
From twitter
---
Trophy road
---
They usually release updates on Wednesdays , so hopefully the update is coming tomorrow
---
They explode immediately upon being touched by an enemy.
---
Ur right, he was hinted as a mythic, but he will be trophy road. We don‚Äôt know why he was hinted as mythic
---
I pushed Mortis first and too 550.
---
Who else is at 4000 trophies for tick
---
Looks slick! NEW UI is always welcomed for me
---
Makes the game looks fresh
---
They litteraly said it will be trophy road
---
Where's Thiccochet?
---
Hmmm.... Idk
---
Ok then why did brawl stars hint on there being a new mythic brawler?
---
I pushed Mortis first, and got him to 550
---
Hmmm
---
I‚Äôve prob missed it, but is there a date of this update? Or maybe they don‚Äôt show. Thanks
---
This would be incredibly fun but I highly doubt they could add a mode this complicated :(
---
Can I have ur account? (LMAO)
---
Supercell FINALY did it ( I bet they didn‚Äôt know about that post lol)
---
How do we get the second one, I wonder... just random / 2000 coins like the first?
---
same
---
Yeah my b guess it wasn‚Äôt too relavent I just noticed it
---
I'm so disappointed, because he also said that you need to be lvl.9 to get those SP too
---
Definitely thats the caae
---
Did I do anything wrong or annoying?               Because I deleted most of my posts afterwards considering them to be pointless.
---
I hope seasonal (retro/lunar) skins will be offered in future! I bought the Dumpling Darryl from lunar new year. All brock skins aren't much special except the recent one released. I have few skins i wanted to have. And after update I'll be waiting for Summer jessie sale only!
---
Fucking wrong.
---
Nonono
---
Yeah, very strange, almost like they're going to surprise the brawl stars community with a new brawler in the middle of summer
---
u/JVRose
---
A bibi who grew with Leons
---
Me too
---
That was already mentioned in multiple vids. Above are not tho
---
Agreed. Now that I've thought more about it he'll definitely need buffs. Remember how Bibi got an attack nerf before being released? I think Tick will get a buff before release.
---
That means, we will get a few of this tokens after a rank up with a Brawler (it's really nice if you have a new Brawler)
---
I like the new Shop rework and great idea but is there gonna be a separate shop for Star Points?
---
I don't think barley gets the slowdown from his sp because I saw in the clip that the other brawler (darryl I think) was slowed down aswell. I might be wrong tho
---
I would love this change, but I feel like it may make him pretty OP.
---
I posted like eleventy million times today
---
IMO getting +1 trophy per kill is way better of a solution.
---
tInK
---
Well that's wrong
---
OwO
---
Glad that's cleared up. Now we know for sure that it is messed up instead of just speculating that it is. I was considering spending more money on the lvl 100 box but I'm happy I didn't because people shouldn't be financially incentivising this kind of tactic.
---
I am f2p and i don't care if skins will be only in shop or brawlers tab
---
prolly a insta thing
---
Good point
---
As you can see in the video, also season rewards will include the new kind of coin. So, you can also earn them without using your over rank brawlers.
---
You work fast
---
They always forget darryl
---
For sure this ^
---
They completely remade the shop. I guess they will add a new tab for the star point offers, but I didn't add that to the image since I don't know how will they do that
---
Me to
---
My mini accounts name is bigweld
---
Same in Romania
---
She needs one anyways so they can finaly make skins for her ( imagine the possibilities)
---
This should be some sort of remodel for the skin white crow
---
Pre buff Carl was
---
You stole it from u/CoachFlapjack
---
Will you get them at lvl 10 as like a package deal with the other ones or are they sold separately?
---
I think is a boi that dropped too much lol
---
[Wow so original ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/c57i3x/welcome_to_brawl_stars_tick/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app)

Delete it please
---
Yeaaaaaa, i know
---
That‚Äôs kind of what I was thinking but didn‚Äôt want to say it.
---
And why is that?
---
If this was in game i would totally buy it if i also had crow
---
Don't let a game affect your life, definitely time to move on. We all know that Brawl Stars is simply not the same game as it was in Beta. I've definitely had moments of frustration but if you can't shrug it off then time to put your time towards something else.
---
It os 69 againnnn
---
Cute icon though
---
o nu,it is 67 rip your upvotes
---
Teamers Now wear uniforms.
---
They look like completely different characters, didn't even recognize Dynamike XD
---
I love that song
---
For me it is now 74 wtf
---
Why.
---
Its a part of the song great balls of fire
---
for me it is 68 
---
 
---
the upvoting system is broken
---
Yea
---
Dude he didint even come
---
now it is 70
---
 my head hurts so bad that im crying rn because i cant handle the pain wth
---
Iam just talking about the people who didnt ur fine then
---
this one is cool
---
The main thing is that you always want to have at least one brawler at power 9 if possible...so that you have a chance at getting a star power in your boxes. Other than that, it's up to personal preference, but playing more brawlers will help you advance on trophy road and get those rewards faster
---
Give this man a platinum
---
And my robo Spike,I make the idea after
---
Already a skin for tick
---
Video link please
---
Whats his message
---
omg realllllyyyyy?!?!#!!1!!1!1!1?!
---
i cant believe dis omg supercell pls see dis now omg
---
You mean Tickochette
---
What I mean is that you need to grind(which is time consuming) or buy the coins becuse its easy
---
I gotta grind 700 trophies before they replace it with Tick....
---
He's so uncreative
---
You have to unlock them separately. If your brawler is currently power 9, it's possible you could get the new one before the old one
---
New brawler, announced today.
---
What??lmao
---
Yes, you have to unlock each of them. They said you could choose betwen them IF you have both unlocked soo...
---
No apparently Tick will go live as soon as the update drops
---
They will. Frank confirmed on Twitter
---
Really I was just asking a question
---
They‚Äôre gonna buff his health, right?
---
Right?!
---
Y'all probably already have all the ideas for these, but I had one that would be awesome for Barley, or others that struggle with this, basically make their star power able to destroy bushes.
---
It's just a GIF, nothing special
---
Ok thanks
---
Those skins are great don't know what are you talking about
---
probably. Its not hard to do it since the game knows what rank you are on each brawler
---
This would be a monstrosity if it became an actual Brawler
---
Tara gets her remodel. Maybe she gets a voice as well
---
r/whooosh
---
I think the should‚Äôve named him BumbleBo
---
When is the update going live?
---
But Tick is a new brawler...
---
Who did he fuck tho?
---
Me when I give my grades to my mum
---
By any chance is this inspired by the ww1 poster with a British general printing out and it then says 
---
"Your country needs YOU!"
---
Ye the Crow and bo are fantastic but I kinda dislike the others, Mike‚Äôs little bird is great tho, but now crow who already had 2 skins gets another, spike already had one and mike to. Why doesn‚Äôt Tara get a voice and skin and why doesn‚Äôt Leon get a skin?
---
tomorrow idk
---
Than why you posted this shit there?And also make it 2 part....
---
Yeah robots are fukin cool
---
Maxed (10)
---
You know what‚Äôs **really** laughing stock?
---
Tick‚Äôs health
---
In a way yes. But don't think that this will happen on a regualar bases
---
Ÿà ŸÇÿ≠ÿ∑ÿßŸÜŸä ÿ®ÿπÿØ üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Um yeah
---
Sick
---
Yeah, that sounds NOTHING like his Star Power "Curveball"
---
if you DC'd you don't get them
---
I got 2
---
He lost his soul
---
Idk i think all this 4 skins are so good but everyone has his opinion
---
Welcome to the Thrower Gang, Tick. Yes, now I'm imagining Skull Creek now. Good god.
---
Band aid rolling reload curveball well oiled hyped bear balls of fire
---
Cuz Tick is not mythic
---
Nice one Lex
---
Leon moves too fast tho
---
Hmm who knows
---
They had us in the first half, not gonna lie.
---
I know it says "Humor"
---
Throwing a ‚Äòcurveball‚Äô has two meanings. 
---
1. A ball that when thrown, curves.
---
2. A ball that when thrown, goes faster.
---
 Sometimes both.
---
Thats what the post says, not your comment
---
But why could i ungain trophies cuz the map is full grass and i can't move
---
She will probably heal everytime the bar is full. I will use band-aid as soon as I get this SP
---
And how i gonna kill 1v1 tank in showdown with same amount of powercubes?For most brawlers it wouldn't be so hurt,but for Mortis...
---
Just wait till it comes in the store
---
Wait, Tara remodel?
---
r/mortisgang
---
No. This is not confirmed. He just said he‚Äôs feeling cute and MIGHT remodel her later.
---
Yay Gedi kor is back!
---
By our thicc powers combined...
---
Tick has a very slow reload as well
---
Good job
---
Major oof
---
Thanks... I was originally at 3400ish
---
JUST DONT PLAY THE MAP JESUS
---
I kind of like the invisiheal description. It would be cool!
---
jokes on you, *i'm now at 386* after feast or famine
---
If you watch when they show tick, Franks health regenerates 200 while in spikes super
---
Are you saying that both of those create both of his star powers.
---
&gt;I totally agree with you.
---
They agree with you lol
---
Brock skins be like:
---
"I always come back"
---
This has been done before, and will always have the same flaws. 
---
1:Teamers can easily find other teaming signals.
---
2:The game would easily get confused between spinning and normal movements/dodging shots.
---
I‚Äôve seen this idea before a lot, and it just wouldn‚Äôt work.
---
No, I'm saying one of his star powers affects his super. We don't know if the other one does
---
where did they say that ? do you have any links ?
---
No not a bad meme
---
That's genius
---
Idk i thought no one would like this except me
---
I mean that one may make his "pet" faster and the other makes him heal faster.
---
That was a comment from frank somewhere in this reddit.
---
You messed up
---
Just play for the star token and don‚Äôt rush mid? It‚Äôs pretty simple. I‚Äôve played piper fine on there.
---
# "You can now only buy skins if you get a special offer"
---
Nothing like a good old hobbit meme.

Thanks for crediting me, also very true

great idea, I like the super design with the snowman hat

The remodel looks thicc

It took 10 days?

P2w players buy everything tho so this meme doesn't make sensr

But come on we had no way to beat them, we were all tanks and we literally couldnt move without the three turrets sniping us..

Why in the hell does bibi look like just came out from filming an anime movie or something japanese?

Your comment is a joke

Looks better than the original.

I might do some in the future! I don‚Äôt think I have the skill to create gedi-kor level stuff tho

Wait so just wondering, did penny kidnapp the turret while tick was just going to the store or did he technically abandon the turret
---
I deleted the post cause it instantly got negative karma
---
Me: that‚Äôs pretty cool

Everyone: this is my favourite so far!!!

What's her new star power?

I‚Äôm gonna do what I like to call a **pro gamer move**

se llama marina, es una sirena su poder es lanzar burbujas distancia media como nota su ultimeit es que conchas la protejen y cada golpe que le lanzan se rregreza con mismo da√±o y efecto su categor√≠a es s√∫per especial su abolidas especial despu√©s de los puntos de fuerza es que dos cangrejos con 500 de vida persiguen y atacan a los enemigos esa es mi idea gracias ojal√° la escuchen mi usuario de juego es ‚òØÔ∏èOMC 1228‚òØÔ∏è
---
That musketeer looks so cute
---
Yeah yeah got that but I lag most of the time üòÖ probably server issues
---
Even better
---
But is a new brock skin :(
---
Idk I‚Äôve been waiting for a skin for bo for a while but this one just looks so completely different from him that it‚Äôs kind of disappointing. Ig I‚Äôll have to wait and see it in game

ArE yOu SuRe AbOuT tHaT¬ø

Thanks for explaining the joke Peter!

Oh sorry! That was my first post ever and I‚Äôm new to Reddit so I did not know what would happen but I was intending to make a joke about something in the game.
