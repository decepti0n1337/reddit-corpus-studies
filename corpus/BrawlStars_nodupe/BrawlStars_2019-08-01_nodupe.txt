Easy trophies + fun
---
---
---
this is beyond science
---
I think we should be able to see lifetime statistics for every brawler (or only above 300 üòú)
---
Exactly
---
WHERE IS DA HAT BRODAH?? Really
---
The title makes me cringe... otherwise nice idea
---
·¥ã
---
Idk
---
Cool. Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.
---
I don't have a mouth:(
---
How it feels when trying to run away from an el primo.
---
Nice, good job!
---
It's the best feeling to have a good thrower. Nothing worse than that. Other than a noob mortis.
---
I already did that!
---
You can check out my profile! üòÉ
---
711 trophies with mortis. Impressive
---
Thank you!
---
815 pb :)) trying to get 900+ this season
---
How can you bypass the no hat curse so easily?
---
He would look better if he had a hat üé©!
---
i am the god mortis. that's how i guess. now FEEL MY WRATH
---
i can do one with the hat too. i think i can say i have mastered the art of the screenshot :)
---
I‚Äôm trying to get there with frank, got to 800 last season as well
---
Well... i don't have any sheets but I kept listening to that losing bgm and recorded instruments. (Or... TeChNoLoGy Is NoT tHeRe YeT.)
---
it actually IS confirmed that Jessie is Pam's daughter
---
Snappy sniping is better
---
That I know, but Colt and Bull are neither confirmed nor Denied
---
Lol I just recently found out how to screenshot on a iPhone X
---
this is broken beyond broken
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
They are all bots walking straight
---
wow. i really struggle with frank. got him to 500 as a lvl 2 in cavern churn before the trophy update but my best is 601 with his first star power :| im really bad with him.
---
Seems like the easiest target to no way he beats a shelly with bandaid
---
Hmmmmm... maybe? ü§ó
---
Oh okay i understand now op dyna
---
My dude how long did that take you?
---
I mean yeah,to me bull and colt just don't go together as a family
---
F
---
how? i dont have one but my cousin bought one recently and she cant figure out the screenshot eitherü§î
---
I have all brawlers and they are maxed. All it takes is  a 40 dollar iTunes gift card after every paycheck. It‚Äôs quite the OP strat
---
Is there a brawl us or just uk
---
See you in hot
---
Waga baga boo boo
---
Like si quieres que rico tenga la skin de ricochet si tenemos likes puede que vuelva
---
Thanks
---
since when did bs become p2w
---
Lol all depends on your mood and whether or not you want star points or boxes more.
---
You dare question the craft
---
Hope to find some diamonds
---
r/chessmemes
---
Like if you want to have again a ricochet
---
dynamike would still probably win. one shots mortis.
---
Tonight, night night diamonds tonight
---
If this comentar y have many likes we can hace a skin of ricochet üòã
---
and even in brawl ball when he throws the ball it uses up that first slot so he can‚Äôt use his star power to catch up to the ball unless someone else throws it
---
do more1
---
Some people like a challenge. I‚Äôve known people trying to push a good brawler without upgrading it for fun ^^
---
Awesome man
---
do more
---
But it is a team game. Liking the challenge still screws over teammates unless you are playing in solo showdown. That‚Äôs what I don‚Äôt understand.
---
What the fuck
---
very interesting idea and style! good job
---

You‚Äôre missing dynamike.
---
The third and fourth panels are supposed to be the same.
---
Thats ROBO skin 
---
I said MECHA
---
I‚Äôll edit it
---
I hate it when my teammate gets one shit by shelly
---
but dyna needs his dynamite but el primo can actually jumo that high
---
hunter x hunter?
---
They‚Äôre not accepting any more submissions for batch one
---
Or call outs like-
---
‚ÄúHey Barley, don‚Äôt rush that Bull with those 12 gems.‚Äù

Frank + bull = reinhartd

They do.  It's the "you lose" screen.
---
_almeno ci hai provato_
---
AHAHAAHHAHAHAHA poco's got me lmao, it's really great!!! Ahahahah
---
Does that only work on the normal attack?
---
 Hey man, great play! can i use your videos for youtube vid, i making a compilation videos for great play. Thanks :)
---
I have seen this petition before and I think it really needs to be in the game.
---
You need to stop making low effort posts, which is why your posts never get to the "hot section."
---
How about 9 normal brawlers to make it 10
---
It's late at night no one will see this 
---
amazing peice of art
---
Look at my trophies teamate
---
Coiled snake in most brawlers makes the length of the attack longer, yes
---
I have reported every single one of your posts due to low effort because posts like yours (that are low effort) are toxicating the subreddit. Please keep the subreddit clean!
---
I'm over 500 and they match me with the under 400 guys!! My enermy are over 400 and over 500!!
---
Yeah I realized that too, but I think it would only make maximum one percent difference
---
click on the star power icon on the top right of the brawler portrait
---
haha yeah if I miss 1 second of it, I'll be a dead meat.
---

That happened to me too against another leon, he were at a lower level than mine so i killed him in three shots.

When do you think is a good time to post on this subreddit? I'm on Pacific standard and I'm aware that brawl stars has fans globally so I'm not sure when's the perfect time to posr

the first time i used mortis i kept getting stuck in the wall
---
Nice

Is he going to dribble the ball into the goal?!?
---
NO! NO! NO!

IS HE GOING TO SUPER THE BALL INTO THE GOAL?!?
---
DON'T TELL ME HE'S GOING TO SUPER DRIBBLE THE BALL INTO THE GOAL?!?

YES! YES! YES!

Everyone wants to win. If you team with someone your chances rise up. Simple logic

Don't post at night.

I'm sorry did you say T i k  T o k
---
Would you be happy with braindead teammates 500+? I guess no. There many of them on 500+. The problem is new trash trophy system, where every player easy gets 500+ so he can be matched with skilled gamers. Skilled gamers suffer, but they cannot do anything.
---
Bruh I can‚Äôt even kill a zero power cube Shelly with a 5 power cube mortis
---
Ha ha! Rekt
---
I just got Bibi at 8k couple minutes ago
---
To throw hacking and teaming in the same category is a testament to your anger. All is fair in... Is a figure of speech as I know you know. Very few things in this world promote a win at ALL costs mentality video games is one of them (as well as love and war). I've been on both ends of teaming and ive had fun on both ends. Saying I don't care about anyone trying to have fun is a stretch for the fun is in the game not just winning. The word "cheating" implies getting caught leads to repercussions. How ever that is not the case if I was hacking that'd be a different story. Besides everyone teams whether they know it or not. What's the difference between teaming with someone and stealing a kill? The teamers meant to team up? Pathetic. Until everyone stops interfering with 1v1s or as they called it in the old west "Showdowns" I'ma do what ever I want.
---
Big Brawler be like:
---
WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN MY SWAMP?!?!?
---
#CAUSE BABY TONIIIIGHT
---
I remeber that a guy post this about rosa before nerf
---
Slash them to death
---
But they‚Äôre 18, due to the power of non canon fanfics, thus making your card redundant.
---
It‚Äôs a cool idea but there‚Äôs no way supercell is going to spend there time into making it when it barely does anything
---
Shall we draw it again? I've drawn something before.
---
Beta player
---
Bull will have special Berserker and Tough Guy tags so you know that he will totally destroy that team
---
But still - you don't wanna risk it.
---
It looks like everybody's mocking colt
---
Nice dude
---
Thx
---
Thats just your personal opinion. A lot of the meta plays gem grab and duo showdown as their main mode.
---
H A C K E R M A N
---
So they were all trying to survive and/or get kills? You mean...oh god....they‚Äôre doing the things that are the whole point of solo showdown?
---
But you will ruin it becuz you will just one shot everyone
---
If we stop bringing attention to it then how will it ever be balanced. If we just suddenly stopped talking about it being overpowered then how is Supercell going to know that the community wants it to be nerfed
---
I love how the Carl went on the launchpad it made everything more tense and exciting and action-y
---
Wow, what an easy and a quick fight... And then a great dinner!
---
Thanks i was the carl
---
Like...gotta run
---
Best idea ever ü§© if supercell will add this finally my duo teammates dont die whenever they respawn
---
Nice super!
---
that rico skin was able to be bought at 19 gems as a deal before rico got a remodel
---
First of all....why dose this exist?!
---
And second of all... fantastic fan art
---
those coins are a blessing just wished there was more of them
---
What in the unholy sweet cinnamon toast fucking crunch did you just bring upon this already cursed land you whet bean burrito.
---
Oh shit, i see people flexing 150 gem emotes on me :(
---
i had 12k with 23 and then i got gene and bibi back to back
---
Blyat, [BLET] are trash
---
thanks a lot bro :)
---
ok and the point is...?
---
Are you one of those randoms who pick up the power cubes before teamates spawn even when there are nobody near by
---
u stole it ***^(idiot)***
---
Sure Thanks Bro :)
---
Huh? how can you explain my power 9 shelly 896 trophies find me in the leader board
---
Poco loco
---
Thrower will destroy your map
---
Inbreeding
---
Not bad. But ears are too big. Good luck in future.
---
Nice, but you really don't have to write all those [BRAWL STARS] thingies in the title, this is not instagram
---
This would actually make him viable if he wasn't
---
creative post, thanks op
---
Hi I‚Äôm a manager at Omen. We don‚Äôt encourage any of that behavior but we also cannot stop it. You‚Äôll find this kind of stuff in any of the top clubs. Unfortunately it is a method of gaining trophies that can work and of course some players are going to take advantage of that. That‚Äôs how the dynamic of those players reaching for the top is. You can blame the organization all you want but at the end of the day, a group of players does not reflect the will of our community or the ideals we hold.
---
I can't even eat a card
---
I like it!
---
Anyone relies that tick and bibi is gone? They must not go aw man
---
90% of the times I had a random as a Mortis partner in Gem Grab they decided they wanted to attack enemies near their base while carrying 7 or 8 gems.
---
Higher mine
---
I found someone post it before you
---
And you will go around the map collecting powercubes in the form of dynamikes
---
i love the damage taken/given part but k/d can be problematical, some people may(definetly will) focus on k/d, not on main objective. but seeing the total damages should be a thing yeah
---
What a loser. The only way to get your precious internet attention is to steal other‚Äôs art. You disgust me. Trash
---
*10 power cube Shelly coming to check the one bush*
---
OK, the player was bad but not Bull in general
---
Then this star power would be ‚ÄúThrower Detector‚Äù üëçüèª
---
Show the replay
---
Sure, I'd be honoured! Could you send me the link when done?
---
#HMMMM
---
Hmmmm who is pat on the back?
---
:((((
---
IK
---
Pootis dynamike
---
With bird and sandwich
---
No they shouldn't because it is based on your luck but you have 1% chance to gt them from boxes
---
thanks bud
---
Nah it is/ should be because of that Bull skin offer. But who knows. Maybe supercell is generous
---
Thank you for information!
---
hes training on 3d, i know hell be part of supercell
---
El Primo: I can take this Shelly
---
Shelly: yeet
---
i know thank you
---
and its always be too late they already dead
---
No prob!
---
Star point is not as important as getting keys to unlock a box tbh
---
Lmaaaooo ü§£
---
Amazing idea
---
Perfect map
---
But quite unbalanced 
---
Boss player should have a support
---
Maybe he could spawn robots in different places to kill throwers or turrets
---
bad comp, but strong if u play it good
---
Sans Spike Sans Spike
---
I'd choose Maple Barley.
---
It‚Äôs not that bad actually. Crow keeps the enemies low, Leon scares them to keep them back and assassinates the squishies. Spike kills the tanks, helps separate the enemy team, and helps control mid.
---
OMG NEW CHESS MEME FORMAT
---
Cute
---
SUGOIIIIŸ©(^·¥ó^)€∂
---
Still its almost impossible to drop star powers, I have 5 to go, and Im gonna soon upgrade ElPrimo and Jessie = another 4 starpowers.
---
It could probably change to an exclamation mark
---
Congrats dude, still waiting for mine. Would be pissed of I got Crow lol
---
?
---
Cmon they tell what skin u wear
---
Make a simple picture is not making new character
---
The supposed to have enough time to do this
---
Thanks, I wish you get  brawler in the next box
---
Skins are worthless.
---
Fuck el rey and touchdown bull. Grab that sakura spike!
---
Lvl 60 only 4.5 k? Hmmmmm
---
I would call it bouncy ball
---
i have 87 solo wins because everyone targets me untill i get cornered then the brawler that kills me gets killed by another brawler after a second
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/DarrylGang/comments/c9e9x9/darryl_exist1/
---
People from 0-9000k trophies get almost nothing from the season reward because they dont have many brawlers beyond 500

Removed. Keep your post titles descriptive and provide context. Additionally do not use low effort/all caps/clickbait titles.
---
I do get the same response.
---
Lol wut
---
See there system is garbage
---
Other roles?
---
Because there are just 4 roles i see
---
Stealed post, reported. Hope you get banned soon :)
---
Ok. I can sense there are some "younger" kids here that made some grammar mistakes.
---
How is this anything like that?
---
well it's not that good, it's value is not as consistent as steal hoops, like come on, how many times do u roll on every brawler in a 3v3 as Darryl? usually u roll on someone kill them and then roll away, u can argue that u can use all ur ammo to poke then roll but u usually take too much dmg to be able to roll if u try to poke, I don't have it tho so I don't know for sure, it's just what I think when I think about how to use it
---
How
---
It‚Äôd be nice if they could at least make boxes purchasable with star tokens.
---
Why Spike
---
why tf are you advertising your post? You‚Äôve posted it twice in this post alone. You are the biggest karma whore I‚Äôve seen
---
Reported, hope you get banned soon :)
---
idk
---
need more brawlers

Please, no Soviet jokes.

This is from Pokemon S7 E1. Spike orignal design has been copied from here. Look they are totally similar.

Ready to bust some perverts in action.
---
That would be unfair
---
Leon: *cries in no voice*
---
yes!
---
I can see someone with 9 gems running to enemy just to get more kills
---
spike overpowered, bus sans 1 atk 1 def
---
Yea isn't this supposed to be a survey? Brawl stars you all need to leave that survey company and get your funds back brother. Lol
---
god i hate that after every change supercell makes there is wave of complains and choosing beggars begging fo fReE sTuFf Pls !!!!1!1!!1
---
I play with sound and I never can tell when he does go invesible, the sound of him supering kinda mixs with the other sound so u never can tell when he does, but when u do identify the sound he still kills u, cos he's fucking invesible, how am I supposed to fight that?
---
they said that we will be able to buy boxes with sp

and this shit comes invisible...

Btw hiw did you get bibi on your name?

You should add your name to your posts (like in the image) so that people can‚Äôt steal your work again
---
Because gamers aren‚Äôt going to make the game to competitive eventually? Come on brawl stars... every shoot‚Äôem up has stats..
---
It's a user flair
---
Leon, and great job.

Your replay is good,but this replay is frame perfect,stop cramming down everyones trougths,theyll downvote you so much

Mortis dont need a buff, and he better not receive one.
---
This kinda reminded me of the second beta-background of brawl stars
---
Your post has been removed, make sure to use the body of a post to elaborate on the title.
---
Actually this is a rip-off of a post that did the first 2 panels.
---
Poor fish, fish cant live without water
---
I think your absolutely right, but I also think we should have other ways or getting star points, like through a quest system, or even a SINGLE PLAYER system
---
Instagramer !!!!!!!!
---
I was thinking more like 1 to 10 eggs only per season that can be found only once. When all the eggs are found the hunt is over. Until the following season. Each egg contain its own exclusive content each egg being different.
---
You didn‚Äôt do this
---
K at least nerf shelly and rosa
---
Nightmare fuel
---
Copy
---
Mortises sp would be op
---
It wasnt just skill, he had cubes.
---
And the luck he had was real, I bet if it were me ALL the meteors would come for me.
---
My luck is ass
---
Np, I love your work but one criticism for the spike is that you could have made the eyes closer together. But still, really good.
---
Yes lol
---
Leon should be in knocks on the door then run away because of his super
---
NYEH HEH HEH
---
AAAAAAAAAAAAAA
---
This is a repost, I saw this earlier,  literally a carbon copy. Also the last 2 frames are original but the base of the meme, including the title, was either inspired or ripped off of an earlier post.
---
Nein
---
Is brock biting his thermos bottle or rocket?
---
Shelly I agree, but rosa hell no.
---
If anything she needs a buff because of how weak shes become.
---
If u want to nerf her range then buff her dmg back to where it was, buff her super to 4 secs again.
---
Shelly needs a nerf to her range, super charge rate, and her star power.
---
Spike

I like how the other team didn't defend at all

What was batting stance again?

*dies in anticipation *

Mortis for sure
---
I don't think it's pink, i think its  just the brightness of the hue for the fire
---
Ikr
---
I think once they're back and start adding more skin options for the star points and maybe some other shop options for them, people will finally stop their bitching.  I'd rather be earning star points for something different than tokens, idk.
---
I want coiled snake but i get only rolling reload
---
But you can't see the snek. Its inside the outfit :/
---
This is already a star power that you get by default
---
Imagine your walking towards a bush and Mortis with coiled snake walks out
---

Reminds me of a P.E.K.K.A
---
Also, welcome to Reddit
---
Very good ideas
---
Why don't ppl understand that matchmaking is based on the total trophies of the team. Yours was 378, theirs was 358. 20 trophies isn't that bad. Their matchmaking doesnt take count the brawlers level
---
Wtf, what did you do?
---
Light mode gross
---
It didn‚Äôt catch on I‚Äôm sure. Someone else‚Äôs use of the template did. But you can see it anyway if you click my profile.

Just do opposite of this

Are there any you'd put different?

I don't remember so here's my downvote

Is it not related to Brawl Stars then? I mean it is talking about a player on the subreddit

bull: *goes into another showdown game*.  *there are 9 shellies*.   Bull:*dies because of ptsd*
---
this kid also steals another art
---
it could!

Not all Dynas team. Some Mortises such as myself do.

He also stole the clay robo spike that someone else made and got more upvotes than the original, claiming it was his work.

Crow will jump into your house like Santa üéÖ and be cooked

I find it funny how the first 3 commenters are all asking for fanart of the brawler on their flair...
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Anyways can you draw \~\~Poco\~\~ Mortis next?
---
Never going to happen. 
---
They removed it for a reason. 
---
Supercell is trying to make the game slowly but surely less and less free to play friendly. 
---
Skins are getting more expensive for no reason, they slowly lower free to play reward. 
---
Just deal with it or quit the game.
---
Brawl stars is a pay to win game from the greediest company in the world.
---
Thats cave man Frank

"Classic Brock" would be an easy add to the list then.

Do lunar new year
---
Hey , I got it . Since meteors don't ACTUALLY target the teamers , they themselves become the things they swore to destroy.
---
and the real question is ? why the heck u spend ur life on looking at Mortis body.
---
well, i'm not f2p,and im just fricking tired of people complaining
---
That just means they will be gone July. Not that they are back August first... Those two things are close but not exactly the same. It‚Äôs also a Thursday, if they did come back today. Today and tomorrow are probably bs days where they all talk about their vacation and check email.
---
After Shelly had another total organ failure? Ewww

I need those boxes. NOBODY SAID WE DON'T NEED THEM GONE/REPLACED/REMOVED. NO-ONE.

Inth your comment got removed but in it you said that people SUDDENLY wanted free boxes back or smth. No, nobody wanted them back SUDDENLY. No one wanted them removed at all!
---
First, Brush up on you English. Why would anyone to hog 12 gyms to themselves. I am so lazy that I rarely go to even 1 gym. 
---
Second, having one teammate being the desensitized gem carrier is a great strategy, because your other teammates could defend you and not have to worry if they die. 
---
Lastly, the only thing that apply to this PSA is El Prmo. He hogs 12 gyms to get buff along with the 12 gems. And right before you are about to win he conveniently delivers your gems to the other team with his super.
---
Then Mortis comes out of nowhere
---
Are you fucking stupid, he was the one that did this. u/IGhiimmario stole it
---
The staff is on break

All the shelly are 450-500 range trophies and some of them do not move the whole game, only shooting once ever few seconds

Ye we weren't teaming I just took my position near her to push that mortis
---
Can‚Äôt wait for the new brawler Carl!
---
It is coming next week. At this point we all know what star power he is getting.
---
*uninstalls game*
---
No sorry to say it but he lost 8 trophies and then season final also came. He is in bad shape now. Lets pray.
---
He just wants to go the candy store tho...
---
How do you know, Bibi? You punched another innocent cactus?
---
I just visited then thieves Chanel and almost all his posts are reposts
---
Doesn‚Äôt he have a mail, like OJ‚Äôs where you can send it to?
---
That is so stupid, kid.
---
Probably he will be weak
---
I really want them to either make it possible to buy boxes, doublers or tickets with star points, either bring back tokens as season rewards.

Wait, he's not teaming!?

I think they're trying to AFK push and the shooting they do every now and then is them trying not to go idle
---
I laughed so hard but I just have to say that Mike don‚Äôt always team and Bo/Poco/Nita/Brock/etc. team more often on every map.
---
Mortis gets fucked by everyone when he is low. Bull has the very high DMG outut to justify this Star Power on him
---
Waah but I wanted to eat pizza:(

You have as much as IQ as you have karma

Ironic how your English started to break down only in the disclaimer.

In all seriousness, most people would likely have not known English isn't your native language; you write better than many native adults I know.

Removed - Your post is too short, please expand on your title.

? atrash man stoled me

thanks

That'd be super OP if true- sounds like the ball doesn't actually go farther though?

It‚Äôs token

Wellllll...BYE,NICE  draw

Three very unique symbols. Most of the others look lazy
---
me too!
---
Oh no....it‚Äôs spreading to other games
---
It‚Äôs stolen.
---
Even Better
---
It works good, but vs a good comp they are nothing
---
Or Bibi, another Frank, or Dyna, who jumps over it or uses super or a Piper who jumps on top of you
---
KarmaCourt is mostly for fun, we don't do anything very seriously, we just bring attention to users who did shit like this.

That being said, if OP or anyone else decides to press charges, I am qualified to be a Prosecuting Attorney.

Wait, so the one in the lobby?

If so, this feature would be mostly useless ( Not gameplay related obiviously )

THIS ISNT EVEN YOUR POST
---
Agree
---
I hope you get to team up with some competent gem carriers.
---
It's a pretty standard strategy, it allows the other two to play more aggressively and hold the enemy team back without worrying about delivering gems to them.
---
Yes, it's frustrating when the carrier dies and you lose everything... but that's why you have to protect them, and hope they aren't crappy players.

Realised after a couple of wins

Was believing in Youtubers saying Piper is worst in Heist

FUCKING STEALER

the match ended but your Poco stopped right in range of the gem and continued, spectacular

Basic math suggests, that the amount of trophies you lose doesn't depend on whether it's 2x rewards or regular.

He only mains crow cuz he is toxic and easy to play

DUMBASS STEALER

Whelp now we know why teammates go on the Bo mines

Shelly vs shelly,  band aid wins. Shelly vs offers,  id rather have the first one

Probably because you were leon /s

Anyways just attack someone to get the meteor off of you :)
---
Stop whining about season rewards. You already have season rewards; they're called star tokens. The previous version of season rewards didn't even make sense, since the highest rewards were given to the players that needed them the least, i.e. the ones with lots of trophies.
---
Well crow and spike yeah but other than Leon's invisibility his attack is actually not that great he has a lower dps than throwers
---
Her super is designed to get out of range of close range brawlers with the extra of destroying obstacles, its like Brock's ult but less damage.

Worth it

Not plausible

well at least your name is accurate.... but good point coming from someone with a few thousand trophies behind me. lol
---
You used the gems to destroy the gems
---
cause they're trash, literally no iq, all they do is spin and auto aim non-teamers
---
I can guarantee that everytime i see a Piper play they remain at a distance where her shots deal more damage than a Brock's in 75% of a match

AKA mini pekka

dude coach flapjack is gonna get so mad if he sees this

Wait... You forgot something.. The Chirstmas gem mine that exclusive Gem Mine map with snow And... NEW ICE THEMED BRAWLER INCOMING AND I CREATED ONE HE'S CALLED SNOW. Just go to my profile to see him :v
---
You right now: TLDR. We all have our opinions. Each response you have typed wasted 5 minutes of your life because I am an obstinate brat that will ignore all your rebuttals. Trying to convince me is absolutely pointless because even if your reasoning totally turns my point upside down I will refuse to acknowledge its existence. To me adding a report button isn‚Äôt unnecessary despite never giving rebuttals to your rebuttals that proved it to be unnecessary.

They should make custom ban. So that you can custom ban "charles" and he will never be matched in your team again.

*Gene without the huahua

Yea, but when someone is teaming, then it's like: Nope, not the teamers, they're goos

and she would finish 2nd instead of 3rd

hey there, Dani, do we get more gems the more times we are featured in the video? or do we just get 100 gems across the board?

Frick you i want bo

Thanks!!

Not as bad doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs good, it‚Äôs on the edge of acceptable rn

You just steal everything you post for karma, you are a fucking insta normie, how do you even have time in your shittie life to play brawlstars

Oh why dont you use photoshop then

When your opponents are bigger idiots than your teammates is the only time the game ends in a win.

Just anything to do with the post! I highly doubt saying "don't let this die in new" will attract more attention to the post, and I would imagine that it'll just make some people annoyed.

Rip, i dont know if mobile photoshop is good tbh but i used a mouse to draw the template on pc photoshop and i really struggled

You even steal this post are you fucking kidding me

There's no proof and this wasn't your original idea. Other people have posted this before.

He looks like a hotdog

starlist.pro WAS RIGHT

Definitely going for that when I get the last 4 brawlers I need: gene mortis spike and crow... crow seems op in showdown and gem grab if u play him sorta like Tara but less aggressive just trying to always tag but just never getting hit
---
(Pam + poco + gene) √ó starpower - healing mushrooms = Never die
---
How about fuck no?
---
I'm not judging you but mostly the new player noobs are the ones who have their Shelly/Primo/Bull as their highest trophy brawler. I've literally seen a player with 2k trophies have 600+ Primo.

but with coiled snake he is going to be easy enemy to deal with

It doesn't work like that, you can't just keep rolling because you trade shots so you'll die. Kairos is wrong this time ok?

Better than a legendary

Its not there is no showdown with out one but if your lucky there will be 0

The only brawler that can't attack over water

Tbh I like the 3 pushes and it made the game mode much better, at least in my opinion.
---
hope they change it to a star skin

What about 15 players in the game and 5 teams? and maybe Squad but 20 players and 5 teams, sounds cool.

This is really good! Loving all the little textures! :)

i just wish that they make brawl ball a permanent game mode instead of swapping it out with siege. siege sucks now, and brawl ball was always way better anyways

Then it would sound disgusting

Ok, it‚Äôs not one of the repetitive shitting on you comments about you constantly reposting, but like, you used to make decent posts (not like I can say if they‚Äôre good or not) but I liked them. But now you‚Äôre just reposting and not crediting like as if that would give you free karma. Not how it works. If you want to repost, credit the original creator. Or even better, make your own content. Hope you can stop receiving all the hate you get and actually make original content. Who knows, maybe you can have tons of karma one day and be able to make great, high effort posts. I‚Äôm just saying, try making original content.

Teaming aint alright

Teaming on mortis your just trash

Man I pity you mods in here, having to take care of 700 posts per hour, probably done by young children or with horrible english, on top of the crap memes. I appreciate the effort :)

i dont think darryl really needs a buff but instead a nerf. his ability to kill is too consistent and easy in low and even high levels. steel hoops needs also needs a tiny nerf (5 percent maybe?). i think maybe if rolling reload also  gave darryl a +10% super charge rate it would be pretty viable.

Language lol
---
Alternatively, add coin, gem and ticket offers in the star shop so star points are actually useful

I've got my hopes up my man :D
