ah yes of course

---
---
I also don't like her, actually, i don't like any one of ,,spawners", nita is my lowest trophy brawler
---
Old Rico was ugly af tho
---
Normally the trophies are fairly close to each other, like maybe 20 or 30 apart. Someone who played would know that you absolute imbecile.
---
Noice

Wait...

I had to buy Leon at 10k and lost all my saved gems ...

That enemy primo was pretty awful. Anyways, gg

Okey dokey

People don't realise how awesome this actually is...

Lol you're getting so triggered about how stupid you are üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Lol, basically why I put a disclaimer in the title
---
Super cool
---
Oh so the guy who said that i have to max out 1 brawler at the time to farm coins was half right?
---
I don't have to upgrade the brawler to max, i simply have to max out his power points cap.
---
No. BOW DOWN TO YOUR NEW GOD
---
And a Mortis skin
---
And a Crow skin
---
And a Leon skin
---
Bro but how do you not know that trophies are normally not crazily far apart in matchmaking? Genuinely, do you know that? I understand matchmaking isn't PERFECT, but it isn't that bad.
---
the only 'me and the boys' meme iv enjoyed. Thank you.
---
This seems like an absolute waste of my time
---
Cool

You were able to roll across the map with one automatic charges super which was like 20 seconds and (20 ish tiled long) so you could get stuck in rivers and stuff which made Darryl op in heist
---
Thanks
---
Oh yeah, mr GENE
---
I understand. I tried to make it a BIBI skin but my friend said.

Ok why is it not a brawler idea.

Congratulations! I'm free to play too, its hard, I start playing brawl in December 2018, and now, i got 5,2 thousands trophies.
---
I mean japan wants round three

Isn't that the joke?

&gt;Thanks! : )Ôªø

THAT'S THE JOKE

He used an app which made a pic pixelated then transferred it to Minecraft, destroyed 4 blocks and rebuild the 4 blocks. ( It's just a joke )

One night, a pam and a bull walk into a bush. The next morning, three people come out. WhO iS tHe tHiRD pErSon?

Also, please do not comment that poco needs a buff or that he doesn't need one. This post is to highlight the arguments people have on this topic.

Is that 2100 lines of code? Dear god

Good job

There are a lot of noobmaster in bs now
---
It‚Äôs because the skin glitch when bunny penny loses she strikes the winning pose
---
Poco needs a buff.
---
Yeah all I keep getting is bibi points out of boxes. Can‚Äôt wait to max her points so I can only get resources.
---
It‚Äôs a choice
---
Wow
---
Colt is already fast enough with his star power, no.need to be faster than old bibi. Colt with star,power can bassicly outrun everyone except mortis and crow he is even faster than orimo!
---
My username is in the replay. What are you talking about? lol
---
I'll admit it wasn't the cleanest game by me (by any means). Produced a funny result, though.
---
Wheres the template??? I like it
---
That Poco was at 900 trophies, so you can see that he/she isn‚Äôt an experienced player at all. Who even uses Poco for boss fight at all?
---
Darryl's super length was changed in 2019 so it could have been 2017-2019.  
---
Maybe you should have put What's the current upgrade system?
---
That‚Äôs important, how you feel doing archivements in the game (:

:D

Thanks, I hope so, I could really use some help tho cause I hate counting on randoms lol

---
She doesn't need a buff, I just don't like playing her.
---
Only remember two, ricochet (no idea how to spell it) and mortis hat
---
yeah, I did hahaha
---
Question... why do you spin so much?
---
Funny thing is I thought I muted the recording, I was wrong.
---
Dude im also playing since beta and f2p just got 10k trophies too. Can we team up to play some games??

Me and the boys ruining other's experience.

I hate you and myself conbined

Im playing since global and alreafy hit 9k, no leggies and no gene

Why isn't Bull in a Bush
---
Mine is around 0.1152%
---

---
wow primo and bull aren't even meta.
---
Accurate af
---
Hey kid stop trying to act like SUPERCELL
---
Who would win? Crow, Leon and Mortis (they all have 820 speed) vs this fast boi?
---
So its if crow and barley had a child who copied every thing except super. I love it
---
you should watermark it better
---
Lol I didn‚Äôt know they were called mouse bots so I just called them annoying midget robots üòÇ
---
Wait where are bull el primo and darryl are they camping in that huge brawl stars bush!!!?!??
---
I count 16 of them.
---
And I found your answer very accurate
---
One question is the reason that crow t pose because he hasn't been remodel yet?
---
I think I was that Frank, I was having a bad day OK?

The matchmaking is fine, trophies, not power level...

---
Ignore these negative comments dude,well done ü§ô
---
You tell your parents that you won a boss fight on a mobile game?
---
Bull pam and colt. Pam gets all the power cubes and stays with the boss to do most of the damage. (Win condition and if she dies with all the cubes then you basically lost already)
---
Bull is there to body block for pam to an extent and to do alot of damage with his star power because in boss fight you are always at low health so the star power is going to increase your damage output more then primo can dream of. If he dosen't have star power then you can still play him but a primo could be a better option but eh. (Flip a coin in that situation)
---
Colt has arguably the most important job out of the 3, RUN AWAY. Yes colt runs away from the boss for 2 main reasons;
---
1, so the rockets wont land/focus on pam and bull
---
2, to deal with the tiny robots because you have the damage output and range to kill the bots and if you have the star power your job will be SO much easier, dodging rockets will be easier and the mouse bots will hit you less often because you can run a little faster than before. Make sure to be  far away from the boss but not to far away.  Close enough that you can see the boss at the edge of your screen but far enough so you can deal with the robots and the rockets. If you die then the rockets will go for the tanks and thats not good.
---
In place of colt people recommend leon and mortis but here is why you shouldn't use them.
---
Leon can only do good damage at close range and his reload is so slow, you can even use your super because when you use it you're technically "dead" to the boss so the rockets will go for your team and thats not good. Even tho you are faster then colt he is still a better option even without star power. Also his super can actually be used compared to leon.
---
Mortis may be able to run around so the robots will never get to his team but he can't kill anything and the robots start to move really fast after a minute so they will gun you down. When you die (likely to a mouse bot running at the speed of light) all the robots will run down onto your tanks in this massive death ball due to the build up of all the robots that you couldn't kill. Also he can't even kill the boss without dying.
---
They wouldn't understand idr
---
hot
---
You only fought one of the Shelly‚Äôs though?
---
He absolutely does though. He's in the bottom of the tier. There is nothing he can do that Pam can't do but better.
---
bruhmoment
---
Yup
---
I'm also free to play, playing since global (12/12/2018) and I have 6.5k
---
He is just very good with him. Definitely plays brawl ball, his only good mode
---
Shut yo death threat bullcrap up
---

---
It only got changed in, like 2018 tho.
---
Warrior screech
---
So many minor things they can add to this game to make it even better
---
I still remember going between the walls surrounding the safe on the sides as Darryl and using my super as a multi-hit thing on the safe.
---
Oddly satisfying
---
Its worth the wait to flex. I got mine around 3k trophies, which is my flair. Hope u get a legendary soon

Piper: you should light up a little sweetie

I know, i'm just saying that both of us seems to be getting like 1000 PP on brawlers we don't want/can't use, although I'm now grateful cause Penny Star Power got a rework

can't argue with that

---
Sure! So im still teaching myself digital art too and my process tends to vary. 
---
I started with a rough sketch and uploaded it to photoshop. Usually I'd make a greyscale shaded image and use colour layers afterwards but for this one I went straight in with the flat colours and shaded directly on them, using a different layer for each part (skin/eyes/shirt/ground/clouds etc). Once I was happy with the result I'd create the extra lighting effects such as the warmth from the sunlight and the background explosion using normal and overlay layers. I tried to pay close attention to the values in the image so that it looked more natural, I actually found a few references and would change them to black and white to measure the values.
---
If there's something in particular I haven't answered just ask! And if you also use photoshop I'd be more than happy to send you the PSD file.

Good quality but tbh I wish SC would spend their time on designing/adding more important things to the game. I get why they added retropolis and all for Bibi and maybe the enxt souple of brawlers but they really need something big or at least a little game changing/addition to keep the game fresh

i don‚Äôt understand, is that some kind of reference

I had the same thing happen yesterday. I'm on insane 2 and me  and el primo got the robot down to 5%. I died as the other guy spawned. A power cube dropped as the robot hit 1% and they both ran for it directly under the robot and died... 1 fucking percent hp. Power cubes are a curse.

That's the most balanced matchmaking I have ever seen

I actually got spike on public transport
---
Yeah the shading definitely makes the piece pop out. 
---
Actually I did use the lines! Towards the end I usually select my lines and colour them, this one of shelly might not be the best example because I've left a lot of the dark outlines, but basically for example on her arm I might colour the lines a similar (usually sonewhat darker) tone to her skin and it's possible to make it look like there are no lines at all in some areas. I also made the light on shelly from the explosion on a new layer above everything and just went staight over those lines. Hope I've explained that okay!

I can‚Äôt be the only person that thinks tara looks fine as she is, I mean a remodel is well deserved, but I wouldn‚Äôt mind if she just kept her current one

Yes, I really saw someone teamed in duo showdown whole night. They won and won and didn't lose for any matches.
---
That's one useless gene allright.
---
They won't bring them back. Period. Asking for it and believing it will happen is stupid
---
u/KairosTimeGaming you need to see this
---
Low effort
---
Although it is really good, just a few people saw this post.
---
It's Icearrow. I'm [–ë–õ–≠–¢] too and you need to be [ –ë–õ–≠–¢] all need to be [–ë–õ–≠–¢] !!!!!!!

I exaggerated it a bit.
---
Lol, thanks babe
---
Wait insane 7????
---
yes
---
Damn...
---
Like father like son
---
He just got nerfed
---
When you have been playing actively for 7 months+ and dont have any mythics or legendaries
---
God I've got more downvotes, I just cleared insane 2 with a dynamike so the people down voting are clearly trash
---
Why a legendary? Everything about him is so unoriginal and simple
---
Thx!
---
Could you substitute Rico for Colt?
---
what do you think
---
Wow I didn‚Äôt notice that üòÇ
---
Same here, at about 6500 trophies aswell
---
I think Rico cannot run as fast as Colt with star power and has low health
---
Ye

Alright, I'll give it another try when I get tickets, thanks for the tips

It looks really cool.

No from 9879

oh, if it is 0 to 10000, you are really genius. however 9879 to 10000 in even a month isn't easy for me
---
They steal other stuff too so no shit
---
After 3 min, boss had 70+ hp
---
Is that Shovel Knight?
---
Hey u/Perhk, just a question.
---
If 4 people were trying to kill you while teaming, what would you do?
---
A little won't hurt, just don't add too much or else supercell won't make money
---
THROWBACK to when you could play brawl stars vertically. That‚Äôs what would bring tears to my eyes
---
Looks fair to me. What‚Äôs wrong?
---
The perfect meme doesn't exist, that's the answer
---
#OH YEAH!
---
Cool, but not too impressive as you just sorta spammed Shelly‚Äôs super. But still neat with the power cube disadvantage.
---
Click bait at its bestüíÄüíÄ why do they do it? Just look at the views l... it works cuz yall fall for itüíÄüòÇ
---
No it is not
---
lol i didnt know that i thought botanist means female boxer
---
Welcome to the internet!

I wanted to draw some nerf darts

Lucky, mine was crow.

Name: A Bit Much?
---
mortis remind me of the weird school janitor
---
I understand
---
If this doesn't end up in the game I will be MAD
---
Yeah 3 of my friends had crow first, unlucky. Feels  bad man
---
Sniper bot: and make it doubke
---
So here are some brawlers that are good in boss fight:
---
-Colt
---
-Bull
---
-Pam (especially with star power, it‚Äôs op)
---
-Leon
---
-Poco
---
-El primo
---
But isn't it all brawlers business to reap souls , including Mortis?
---
Who‚Äôs gonna tell him?
---
Which app?
---
Hello! Could I please use your clip in my Brawl Stars Highlights series? :) You would be properly credited in the video and in the description of the video. I won‚Äôt use the footage without your permission. If you‚Äôre interested, here‚Äôs our channel: [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt5A9Y-b\_TnvG6SKYpcPu3g](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt5A9Y-b_TnvG6SKYpcPu3g) . Thank you!
---
Hah
---
No maybe main damage but nerf super
---
I wanna say r/woooosh but I can‚Äôt tell if this is a joke or not lol
---
I was talking about how mortis and Dynamike were on the same team.
---
Ya'll need to play Fire Emblem Heroes if you really want an ear-ending screech.
---
Not a bug, just unlucky. Disconnecting doesn‚Äôt make your character invincible. A bot temporarily takes over. And I guess it just got killed.
---
Some sprinkles of ***colt?***
---
But Shelly's super is generally worse.
---
Maybe lmao
---
That‚Äôs how all marketing works
---
The red drop logo is...
---
Legendary
---
My phone's storage: *laughs*
---
So do people
---
lol
---
Best anti teaming and camping
---
Yeah i dont get it too, why the heck someone would name them self fortnite
---
That is totally not shovel knight.
---
He needs both
---
That poco just was dumb
---
Yep, now there is only one brawler who has a "respect" losing animation, and it's Tara
---
How rhe hell are you fine with teaming?
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Ur fidget spinner looks fine
---
And I bet after the remodel it will probably be some gymnastic headbutt into the wall or something along those lines... *I'd love to see her disappear into a portal tbh*
---
Morris is the only acception.
---
...why?üòì
---
Yeah
---
https://crux.page.link/kve8
---
That‚Äôs why I‚Äôll team when th game starts
---
Where would supercell get money from? Lol
---
Good idea though
---
I think a voiceover wouldn't be too bad either, I sense great potential.
---
nice
---
I was playing some SSB yesterday and thought the same thing!
---
Doubt the licensing would ever happen, though.

---
Of course!
---
We need this!!!
---
made me think if thats where the ammo comes from...
---
Piece of work
---
YES PLEASE, I WILL TAKE THIN RICOCHET PLS
---
next brawler shoulda be legendary amerite
---
Hmm...I thought pams husband is bull...
---
Got it today with 0.0144 from a bb
---
You‚Äôll never catch me :p, starve to death stupid Mortisüëª
---
I have a better name
---
Secret tunnel
---
But penny has a better star power now because it was buffed...and actually it was a really good buff, so I think pennys mortar is still better (just my opinion)
---
Buy every skin... Like why not? Have some gems left over for the next new brawler or new skins.
---
Repost?
---
We live in a society we‚Äôre it‚Äôs ok to be a trans but playing video games makes you have a metal disorder, so does it even matter anymore

---
I see this error(?) on a lot of websites and youtubers vids. Why do they refer to the 1 v 5 of brawlers boss fight when in app it is called Big Game?
---
I agree hers is better WITH starpower because of the buff but without starpowers i like jessie her turret more
---
Darryl, Bibi, Tara, Spike, and Leon
---
Brawl ball is crap too i think
---
My map, Zig Zag (Showdown)
---
https://crux.page.link/V6Pt
---
I kinda wanna play it, but I feel that everyone would just go rico mid and then brock/piper sides and it would get boring very fast
---
The baby is colt how cant you notice lmao
---
Because her shield is dogshit now
---
6 hours my ass
---
Brawl stars is pay to win (legendaries, power level)
---
Fortnite changing its map is irrelevant due to brawlstars keep changing the active map pool 
---
(I‚Äôm not talking about how the maps change everyday, rather how they removed some like cavern churn)
---
Hold up...
---
Or Mortis with 600 powercubes... now that would be something
---
And a couple of hours of pure pain and suffering after trying to come back from a tilt only to tilt even more.
---
It's true dude!
---
Lmao I dont like this...You made leon baby out of a colt baby...WHY?? WHAAAAAIIII??
---
Wut?
---
Dude who don't want Life leech Back it was  a fun mode
---
Mortis is immortal. I literally can‚Äôt starve to death. I guess you‚Äôll be my slave forever. Constantly looking around corners to see if I‚Äôm approaching. Having that terrible feeling in your stomach that this will be the time that I get you. I will toy with you for however long I want before I FINALLY take your soul and swallow you whole.

When crow uses his super, the daggers dont start in tthe middle of crow. When crow autoaims his super he will land to the location of the enemy where they were when the player taps on crow's super. If the enemy doesnt move when crow taps his super they wont get hit by any of the daggers when crow lands
---
No Problem
---
COPIED THIS WAS DONE A MONTH OR TWO AGO
---
this is normal??

It might be that Retropolis Enigma Brawl video

Im having big problems when opening boxes like i opened 20+brawl boxes and 4 big boxes and did not get a single gem i hardly get 1 ticket and no brawlers.Im at 1603 and have 13 brawlers!üò≠üò≠

My friend when he was at 1600 got crow and many other mythics me still suffering!

As long as u give credit sure, and lemme know when u make it :D

Whats a dildo? (Sry I'm stupid)
---
Why is the power cube say that it's not a power cube
---
Lol I wonder how the creator of this post will react  when they loose,  and enemies star spamming laughing emotes
---
sexual stimulation
---
Um the automata is the thicc one, not the *human girl* for crying out loud.
---
BM is still and will be always be the only reason to play Royale
---
Reminds me of Connie from Steven Universe
---
Really I thought he was God because he could run away when he is about to die, but ok then
---
If you do a big opening, start with the smaller boxes.
---
When you have unlocked a new brawler or Starpower only open small boxes because your chance for a new brawler is decreased and should open boxes so it gets higher again. You can see Your chances of getting brawlers by tapping the info button of a box in the shop.
---
Hope this helps
---
Lul
---
No.
---
See? I'm the dumbest person in this subreddit
---
OH GOD NOPE. THE PROFILE HAS RUINED BRAWL STARS. EVEN NIER: AUTOMATA WOULD WORK AS AN EYEBLEACH FOR THIS S\*\*\*

Heist is just Carl throwing his pickaxe against a wall tbh

How do you know el Primo isn‚Äôt gay?
---
Alright
---
"Pathetic" was not my expectation of what could be depicted as

_Taboo art_
---
I agree
---
It looks like the dynamikes and barley's did a slave trade
---
You aren't because
---
1. The earth is round
---
2. You have carl as your profile
---
3. You don't have any malicious intent

Don't mind my low trophies-high power level brawlers

Where is it said that She is indeed a child?
---
Maybe you are right !
---
To deliver gems to you
---
Just make her shield last a second longer. They were all so upset about her that her super went to extremely overpowered to kind of situational
---
Buff poco :v
---
Just push Colt and Bo I guess, you‚Äôll get new brawlers eventually.
---
&gt;Me killing teamers as dynamike

&gt;Now my name is a lie cause this is my first post

A small price to pay for salvation.

This person on the top is a Goddess... She gave me tips on getting ideas... I am not kidding.

I had no idea left and then i stumbled to her. She told me to do morning walks. And I tried it. In just one day, I got 4 ideas straight!

Thanks Shelly,

Your Colt

Oof

I dont think this is a good idea since player usually do it and they mean it
