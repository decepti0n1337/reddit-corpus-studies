This is a really good map. You can tell that the creator went into detail instead of just placing large groups of blocks and bushes. Props to you and I hope this makes it into the game!

Hi Supercell.
---
If in some future update you can play in a team with the same brawl
---
Yeah especially for the people above 10k. I originally intended all of these rewards for them but I realized that would be kinda unfair
---
I’m just wondering what that has to do with what I said?
---
Maybe you could customize your attack animation 
---
Gimme info im intrested
---
 No just his regular attack
---
No oof
---
Oh wow
---
Colt uses mini-miniguns instead of guns.

Ohhh that’s a super good idea I’ve never thought of that. Maybe post it on a seperate post?

100% not. She is super map dependant. A lot of these players are low/mid level player so she may seem OP there but in high level gameplay, or even as low at 7k or 8k, she isn't OP

well bush checking is always a problem for piper but I feel like on this map it’s easier since most of the bushes are in long, straight lines so that you can cover a lot of area with one shot

A primo could jump in the middle and wait out the game unless there's thrower opponents
---
Basically like a fat buck shot instead of the bird shot he normally shoots. 
---
Is there a way to be a beta tester or something like that
---
Woww
---
Thats a nice idea, I want to try kicking spike into walls
---
No one beats the bull
---
A h h a
---
This post says he's the only brawler who cant check bush, well guess what he's also the only brawler who can dodge and weave around like a f#ckin ninja, and yes i have mortis but i dont come here complaining about unnecessary requirements because i still kick ass playing him
---
Just stop ffs. If you reposted this from another post, then you're just stealing. But even if you did get it, you're lying. Either way makes you look bad.

u cant add people by user in this game...only by suggested or if they are in your clan.

There is a difference between awesome and Shelly!! LOL

I like the idea of more thematic rewards, at least I think it’s better than 50 gold. I think death effects would be a cool thing too.

Great idea since by now they have a lot of old skins/event skins that are pretty much useless. That would not trouble the game mometization as long as the skins used were first avaliable by gems and the ones who would buy ir already did

What type of iPhone?

Leon, like the top comment says

What’s even better is that you killed them all with only like 3 power cubes
---
Well, anyways, you saw that you will get those brawlers eventually since the percentage increases fairly fast and if you have enough patience, you can save gems for offers. 
---
11000 trophies for the original fidget spinner
---
This isn’t “new”, it’s just rare to see and kinda pointless for people to team in duos unless it’s last 3.
---
Good map, bad post title
---
Umm i dont think .01% for every 100 boxes are fast but k lets go with that
---
The one with a lot of bushes my bad, the bounty one
---
Haters will say it's fake
---
Oh so you know exactly how fast it changes? I dont think so, it changes faster than you think.
---
For your app, I have 3500 boost but can’t get anything. It says transaction has stopped or something like that when I try to buy something. I can send a screenshot if u want.
---
Otherwise,great app.
---
That’s nothing I’ve gotten 67 before 
---
Needs a brain
---
Yea Haha
---
really? that's so unfair
---
67-0?
---
Shelly 
---
Nah it was like 67-8 or something
---
But the 0 part is impressive unless they were afk
---
WFT?? I can't even get my Brawlers to 400. ;\~;
---
thats really good but i just posted cuz they had 0
---
Well I can’t just walk back, the map that’s on in showdown, it’s easy to get cornered on some parts, and easy to get killed, and the gas will cover most of the map, so when it’s 3 teams left, and one enemy dies, when they come back, they respawn, start attacking you and all you can do is run and try dodging, which is hard since their teammate is also there and there’s also a other team which is just waiting for the right moment to come out the bushes.
---
Yeah that’s insane 
---
thanks
---
Great but I don't think oh skins work
---
I'm sure og skins got overwritten by new models
---
This meme template has been multiple times for the same reason, bad maps

I need this now and can bull smash thought the walls?

Yes. Please.

I hope supercell take the idea from you

I don't dislike it but It's better than 50 gold

Yeah I wanna hear og music in-game so I sometimes turn off SFX to hear musics during a match LMAO

Poor Spike :(
---
I keep seeing people comparing Mortis’ damage with others tanks and I am genuinely confused. Why would anyone solo counter a tank with Mortis? Yes his mobility, in addition to his faster speed, comes from his attack, which  makes him the perfect assassin that no one else could replace. I really don’t know where are you going with that. It’s also not the fault of his mechanics that he run into walls, it’s yours.
---
Lol say that to my rank 20 440 trophies Leon
---
Draw it youself
---
I’m untalented when it comes to drawing you see.

Its random bud. Robo best mode for tokens if u have a decent trophy count and power lvl. Not as fun as big hunt tho.. Well. When your boss!!

Hey! Finally something good sorting by new!
---
You both misspelled main character
---
Well. Thats the thing. Ranged characters CAN play cautiously, often tanks have to wait behind cover for the enemy to make a mistake. That already means ranged brawlers have the upperhand, until they make the mistake. Nerfing frank is not the way to go in my opinion, if you mind your spacing and dont lose all map control, its super easy to avoid any of franks attacks.

Are you retarted

Let's be honest, your account got hacked the same way everyone else's did, you tried a "gem generator"

Right poor Shelly

I have 30 small, 3 big and a mega saved. Hope I get Carl and maybe even other brawlers. I haven’t gotten a new one in 2 months.

How to find people that are good? None of my friends play brawl so I don't have anyone and my club is always on their  own world

47 trophies is nothing. Especially considering the new seige mode, where losing hundreds is nothing.

Well I usually don't lose this much trophies on 1 brawler so....
---
Let's see a Pam skin!

You bet more so you received more

Thanks :)

I don't usually lose this much trophies on 1 brawler.
---
I only used 1 ticket

Ok buddy wtf is this.

Eh, might have to go lower on the gems.
---
Other than that good idea
---
I didn’t realize there was a report system to begin with
---
HATEEE it with a passion! 
---
His super is interesting, but it’d be very hard to balance. Can you imagine him paired up with a bull or Shelly in showdown? That’d be way to powerful. 
---
I only have 3.443 trophies 
---
66.67%
---
25% 🤔
---
That's a 15 ticket bet
---
WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY ABOUT CROW NOT NEEDING A BUFF? jkjkj
---
I'd suggest this system instead:
---
Left joystick is movement, right joystick is for aim, A is for auto-aim, Right Top button+right joystick is super aim, right top button is auto super aim
---
it's really annoying even when it happens, if you see my post will see a video that has 3 colt against me ...

I remember I was a Shelly with 1 power cube and a super, then two pams teamed, one had 4 power cubes while the other had 6, it was the meteor shower, and guess what the meteor shower was targeting... *ding ding ding* you got it right, ME, and supercell said meteor shower “prevents” teaming

---
I'm just trying to say that the advantage your opponent has against you, is the same advantage you have against you opponents.
---
I do think that this is a problem but more so in gem grab rather than showdown. It is easier to still 2v1 a respawn ing brawler once his invisibility goes down if you have a power cube advantage, but it's significantly harder if you kill opponents in their spawn but they respawn and you have no power cube advantage. Furthermore you are probably already half dead trying to kill their gem carrier. 
---
Not even the guy who designed leon get it for free why they would give it to you?
---
Now shot is to all posts who say that 12k and higher rewards are shit
---
I’ve had a similar match with a bull throwing the game. He left the safe immediately after spawning to spawn camp the bottom spawns for who knows why, only coming back up to deal with the big boss (but not before destroying the entire right wall with his super leaving the safe wide open on that side) but then proceeds to not care about the safe after it’s dead. The second big boss spawns, and he shoots it twice then runs away to the bottom to let it destroy our safe. Survived 3 minutes, (my average times are around 5:30-ish) and wasted 5 tickets on that attempt
---
Nah I have 2 power 7 brawlers and another that can go to 7 and I'm only at 2k so depending how lucky I get I could get a power 10 by 4-5k 
---
Sorry for misunderstanding, but I thought that was a paso be skill during all the match

He is newer than tara who needs a remodel and a voice so don't expect a leon skin and leon is fine now

don’t forget piper’s umbrella 
---
How do you get the brawler next to your name and also thx for the app tip
---
r/BrawlStarsCompetitive
---
even a other person said a good idea, which I liked, so it’s either if the person who respawn attack, their invincibility bubble disappears, the other is making the invincible bubble less duration
---
ZA WARUDO 
---
Just looked it up and no app actually 
---
Same as in every map where the vault is behind a cover... That's why I made it. Most people find it hard to get the throwers to higher ranks.

Right

From how much days u are playing??. And will u play a match with me??

Some people are just luckier than you are compare it with life not all of us were born rich or handsome but others just have luck and were born like that that doesn't mean you should lose to them just push your trophies and you will eventually find more brawlers.
---
But isn’t shelly the first brawler you get?? Didn’t he do the tutorial before playing the game? I don’t understand. AND she’s not rare!!

It is the fault of his mechanics, his attack line doesn’t have to get the wall, but he will still get stuck on it. And Mortis comparing his damage to other tanks vs assassins. Ok what’s Leon’s damage? I’m sure you’ll say well he’s a legendary that isn’t fair. You’re right, how about Brock, well he’s a ranged character. Crows a toxic assasin, yet he has nearly 3 times the range Mortis has, faster speed, and directs hits with him do equal damage to Mortis. Colt does more damage, gene does more damage, in fact, per hit Mortis has the weakest damage of all assassins. His one argument for his ability is his movement, yet both other assigns have movement speeds greater than he does. He is the 2nd shortest range attack in the game at .4 tiles longer than primo. However he cannot attack over water like primo and literally every other brawler in the game can. My argument is, if he is going to have such a shorter attack range then these player who can kill you before you can reach them, shouldn’t he be rewarded with some sort of bonus? Ie dashing over water, or an increase in damage, or a passive ability like sight? I’m not saying you can’t win with him. I main Mortis. I’m just saying people who don’t think he’s at a disadvantage compared to every other brawler expecially his own class “assassin” aren’t looking at it unsubjectivley.

Lol no have legendarys XD 
---
Depends what your needs are... are you trying to get power points for a specific brawler? Chances are you might not receive them for the specific brawler you need them for! Do you need gold and pp for all your brawlers? Then yes get it
---
Compared to a doubler, yes, but compared to tickets, absolutely not.

if she looks like an adult but shes still a kid its still pedophilia

I think they were, but she still looks more like a princess or socialite to me. I think the umbrella gun makes me want her to be a British spy, and I can't imagine a British voice would be nearly as annoying. I mean, she's not as bad as Pam or Mike, let alone Morris, but she does make me want to be able to turn off voices.

Mega primo would be mega knight primo?

Totally Disagree. Nita is not among those brawlers who are not strong in robo rumble. Once her super is charged her bear can be a great meat shield to Distract Bots and The boss robot which helps all three teammates to act effectively. And her quick reload speed.

Okh.

Sure, but I think the spawns are to close to eachtother, example: Mortis next to a Mike/Piper/Barley
---
Well yeah context is important, this is the first time you're mentioning the details here
---
Try and scout the area before you go into bushes. Thats what usually works for me.
---
Or maybe make an option for us to choose where ammo bar is
---
Should I make an "x" shape of launch pads?
---
Weird hill to die on but ok.
---
People are 'begging' because the current rewards for high-level trophies are genuinely useless, and it'd be more fun and rewarding to push trophies if rewards were better- more incentive, etc. btw what's the end point of your view? Should players never ask for anything?

Petition: Give us more free shit
---
If you put the time and effort in to get to a high rank, if F2P or P2W, you should receive high rewards. A video game should feel like a progression to a higher amount of rewards so you feel like your time spent playing is valued, but it’s currently feeling like they ran out of ideas for rewards. People aren’t begging for free stuff, they’re begging that they’re time isn’t wasted on crap rewards
---
Yeah it slipped my mind before that, I guess it’s pretty important 🤠🗿

Looks good, but not symetrical so won’t work.

Matchmaking isn't fixed yet, no matter what they say. It's as broken as ever. I'm at 4.5k and often get matched against 7k-9k players... and sometimes I also get some random guys below 300 trophies who just unlocked Colt or Bull on my team, which obviously makes the game incredibly unfair for everyone.

Can some explain to me how it works now?  I'm at 6,500 trophies and routinely get place with people that are 3000 trophies less.  So what is the criteria right now?  Is it based on rank? Trophies level of individual brawler? Or overall trophies?

We have already a problem with some players that have a lot of gold stucked in their accounts, i think a Gold Box wont be the right thing right now...

no, brand new players. People starting the game at 0 trophies can be matched with a 5k player who just unlocked bo. Both brawlers start matchmaking and will be paired by single brawler trophy count

May luck come to u 💓

No like 2 updates ago they made it so that you are pooled with people of similar total trophies before considering brawler trophies. Ofc if wait times are long they widen the standards

티밍 해결하는 방안.
---
서론: 티밍을 하지 않으면 이기기 힘든 현 상황에서, 티밍은 최대 골칫거리가 되었다. 뱅글뱅글 도는것을 막는다던가 티밍을 제재 해버리는 따위 보다는 문제의 근본을 뜯어 고쳐야 한다. 
---
☆2~3명씩 하는 소규모 티밍은 전혀 문제가 되지 않는다. 초반부터 중앙으로 달려서 7~8인씩 티밍하는 상황들이 문제이고, 그걸 없애는데 중점을 두었다.
---
-&gt; 티밍을 하지 않고도 다른 방법으로 이득을 보아서 승리하는 방안을 제공한다.  * 티밍을 없애는 방법은 아니다. 티밍으로 인해 노잼화된 현 상황을 해결하는 방안이다.
---
물론 초반부터 중앙으로 모여서 7인8인 티밍하는 행위는 사라질것이다.
---
명칭 : 솔로게이지.
---
설명 : 맵 가장자리에서 다른 브롤러들과 멀리 떨어진 상태로 있으면 게이지가 점점 차며, 게이지가 일정량 차면 파워큐브를 다량 제공.   게이지가 차는 도중에 다른 브롤러들과 일정거리 이상 가까워지면 게이지가 점점 내려감.
---
​(일정량 게이지가 차면 파워큐브를 1개를 획득하고, 또 일정량 게이지가 차면 파워큐브 2개를 획득하고 또 일정량 차면 5개 또 일정량 차면 10개 이런식으로)  
---
☆솔로게이지의 게이지는 시각화하지 않는다.
---
게이지 바를 만들어서는 안된다. 게이지가 차고있는지를 볼수 없게끔 해야 한다.
---
기대 효과 : 티밍안하고 맵 가장자리에서 솔로게이지를 모아서 파워큐브 파밍한 다음에 티밍러들 족치러 갈수있음.
---
​--&gt;그렇기 때문에 유저들은 가장자리에서 솔로게이지를 모으는 놈들을 찾아다니면서 방해하려고 할것이고, 이로 인해 싸움이 자연스레 일어나고 게임이 원활하게 돌아가게됨.
---
유의점 : 티밍을 하면서도 게이지를 채울 수 있는 꼼수가 절대로 생기지 않게끔 게이지가 차는 상황을 깐깐하게 만든다.
---
솔로게이지 추가설명
---
1. 다른 브롤러와 일정 거리 이상 떨어져 있어야 솔로게이지가 찬다.
---
2. 티밍러들은 중앙에 모여있으므로 맵 가장자리에서만 솔로게이지가 차게끔 한다.
---
​
---
​3. 솔로게이지가 차는 중에 다른 브롤러와 일정거리 이상 가까워지면 솔로게이지가 점점 내려간다. 가장자리에 있다가 중앙으로 갈때도 마찬가지다. (가장자리 라는것은 독구름과 일정거리 이상 가깝게 있을 때를 말한다.)
---
추가 이론: 솔로게이지가 티밍을 아예 없앨수 있지는 않다.
---
솔로게이지의 목적은 티밍을 없애는 것이 아니라 티밍을 하지 않더라도 게임을 이길수 있게끔 만드는 것이며, 존버티밍메타인 쇼다운의 근본을 뜯어 고치는 시스템이라고 볼수있다.
---
그렇기 때문에 솔로게이지는 티밍을 없애는것이 아니라 티밍에 대해 저항할 다른 대안을 제공해 주며, 메타 자체를 바꾸는 것이다.
---
솔로게이지가 도입되어도 티밍러들은 존재하겠지만 솔로게이지를 모아서 티밍러들을 족칠수 있고,티밍러들은 솔로게이지를 모으는 브롤러들을 방해하며 대치해서 더욱 재밌는 쇼다운을 만드는 것이다.
---
※ 솔로게이지는 시각화하지 않는다.
---
솔로게이지가 플레이어 자신에게 보이게 한다면 적이 부쉬에 숨어있을때, 내 솔로게이지가 차는지 안차는지 보아서 부쉬에 숨은 적이 근처에 있는지 없는지 알수 있다.
---
또한, 게이지로 인해 게임이 더 조잡해지고 지저분해진다.
---
-&gt; 그러므로 솔로게이지는 시스템 상으로만 오르내리며 게이지가 어느정도 찼는지, 차고있는지 없는지는 볼수 없게 만든다. 게임이 더욱 깔끔해지고 부작용도 없는 효과를 만들어 낼 수 있다.
---
솔로게이지가 도입된다면??
---
​* 중앙 대규모 티밍러들이 모여있어도 가장자리에서 솔로게이지 파밍을 해서 파워큐브를 모아서 티밍러들 족치러 갈 수 있다.
---
또한, 가장자리에서 솔로게이지 파밍하는것이 이득이기 때문에 초반부터 중앙으로 달려서 7인8인 티밍하는 상황은 거의 사라진다.
---
​* 티밍러들은 솔로게이지를 모으는 브롤러들을 방해하기위해 찾아다니게 될것이며, 이로 인해 자연스럽게 싸움이 일어나게된다.
---
​* 티밍이 없어지지는 않는다. 애초에 티밍을 없애는 것이 목적이 아니다. 티밍도 존재하지만 티밍을 하지 않아도 게임을 이길 수 있는 시스템을 제공해줌으로써 근본적인 문제를 해결하는 것이다.
---
* 이전까지의 쇼다운은 너무나도 단순한 구조였다.
---
 단순했던 구조에 솔로게이지를 도입한다면 행동 하나하나가 신중해야만 할것이다. 
---
My bad. I thought im at 24/33 but its 16 out of 23. Still im only missing 7 and one of them i bo at 3k. That just proves im not playing much. Its a side game on my tablet. All im saying is the game mechanic is kinda sad becouse you're not progressing if you cap the tokens. You just get trophies and these are kinda cool but the rewards they provide are mostly silly.  Like 50 gold 3.5k trophies.

Thanks a lot 👍😊

I also am Brazilian, if I write something wrong I'm sorry

Is this "strategy" though? Is it not just luck to not have the Colt or Shelly steal the aggro? Seriously asking.

Don’t buy it!

Great idea but it needs a lot less bushes and there is too much 1-tiles

I would suggest removing the ammo bar for Carl as it is not necessary.
---
The issue is quite new since up until the Siege mode was introduced, it was impossible to rank up twice at the same time, now you can get 12 Trophies on low ranks.
---
The system gave me my Tokens alright, but there are two problems:
---
1. "rank up" section gives an incorrect number, it says 10 Tokens instead of 20.
---
2. Token Doubler didn't affect the additional 10 Tokens. The system gave me 28 Tokens, doubled it up to 56, and then added the bonus 10 Tokens, giving me 66 in total. I should've gotten 70 (it would be 76 if not the fact that my Token Doubler is gone).
---
I didn't lose anything, so it's not any major game-breaking bug, it's just that the system broke a bit.
---
Are you trying to fool us?
---
You can't get a star power till you get a brawler to level 9 -\_-
---
Thank you !!
---
You'd think players with 250 trophies play better than bots...
---
I have 59 gems saved up. I believe that’s how much it’s gonna gosh 
---
kinda looks like Kyle's mom in south park
---
Pls stop with "leon is so op" he's not now n it's just u playing very good. 
---
Why did you not make a new trophy pad with new brawlers?
---
Ooooh I’m excited 
---
Thank you so much!!!👍😊

What's up with the face, and Jessie is a kid
---
Thank you for nightmares!

I miss you Gedi-Kor!!!3 days is a long time
---
Depending on the brawler rarity, the legy chance will go down. But he's a super rare, shouldn't go down that much
---
Thank u for waiting 😄😄
---
Around 4k because the last brawler I got from a box was around 2.5k and now I'm 6589 and haven't gotten one 
---
for some reason people with 3k+ are the same level
---
You can but you gotta get in the boxes first
---
Plus this is one of my first maps so I'm sorry if it sucks
---
:)
---
Bull + Bush... 
---
Well at least you put it was an idea and not claim its real...
---
Mainly it's based on your individual brawler trophies.
---
shut the hell your mouth and speak english you rit rat
---
yes, yes they are. at least pam and jessie
---
Good luck going to Fin3
---
Yeah 😊
---
Your token double being at 152 is the least satisfying thing ever
---
Nice Idea , i agree 
---
I'll be honest... its kinda just a colour rework.
---
that’s the way to do it
---
You should have called this map "Bull".
---
Damm wtf 😨
---
And always shortrange brawlers on longrange maps....
---
eye of the storm is by far the most retarded map ever introduced to the game. idk who tests new maps.

Pleease, supercell, contact me!!!!!
---
Bye, we (will not) miss you 
---
They should just give gems
---
At one point coins and tokens just become worthless to everyone(until a new character shows up)
---
Gems are something that are worth holding on to in my opinion
---
No problem 
---
I've gotten like 17-19 gems (can't remember) from a big or normal box (still can not remember)
---
Its Brawl Stars 3D when you in bush)
---
this was made an HOUR AGO and already has *platinum* holy shot

That's racist. No.

Blue team can just pick all gems as el primor crow and jump back to base or with dynamike with ult and red team won't be able to get 'em if they don' t break a wall

skin idea: anything for tara please

Maybe not the right place to ask this, but do normal boxes increase your Legendary chance?

Guess what? The next box I opened after the offer disappeared I got 3 gems and then I had 51

Because they need a remodel !

bruh

But why are you concerned about respawning, when in solo showdown you can't respawn anyway?  No body has an issue with teaming in dou showdown....because we're already on a team.  Solo showdown literally is meant to be a free for all! So again why are you concerned about respawning in a mode where you can't respawn?!?!?!?!

What game lets you convert precious less precious resources into more precious ones? None!
---
The idea is to make progress harder and spend more real money to progress.

Like when you dont have enough money to buy something and you are offered to give way too many gems to cover the money difference.

all bots brawler are "copy" of other brawler (barryl=bull barley=dynamike ricoshet=colt). 
---
so... Carl is the copy of...
---
Do you want to imitate a better concept? Creativity is more meaningful than stealing.
---
If you are on the late game (only coins) it seems you have a bigger chance of gaining Brawlers from big boxes, on my experience
---
Because my profile is the dark side (? Nah, but I don't know, my options (if I'm not logged) are Yes or Not as you can see in this picture: imgur I don't know if it's something related to your account or any limitation.

Это похоже на склад мусора
---
Repost. 
---
Agreed 
---
I have some ideas about a brawler... You can make a brawler at June? 
---
I think the luck system should be adjusted so that unlocking a new brawler only resets your luck for brawlers of that rarity. As I understand it, right now my accumulated luck will reset when I draw Carl from a box and waste all of the luck gained while waiting to unlock my first legendary. 
---
I don’t think drawing a common/green/etc brawler should kill my chances of getting a legendary for another X months of daily play
---
Thes is awsome dude keep thes
---
Do you want to say that modest people should not participate in the carnival? If your opinion is that, I will respect you. :)

Please :D

I posted the same thing but it was crow instead of a box

im mostly complaining about the thicc comments. ur post is fine
---
As a Brazilian, i can confirm this
---
Can u make Jessie - Megaman?:D
---
Ended up getting to the bottom of it and because I had gotten a new phone and my old one was lended to my buddy I guess he spent a bunch of money on my account then refunded it over 3 months ago but the gems and remained and he just said keep em. Never knew they got refunded 
---
Unacceptable

Barryl?????

lol
---
r/itswooooshwith4os,i got the joke but i litterely read cancer the first time i saw it xD
---
I will probably buy Carl with gems and use the boxes for powerpoints. Also, maybe I finally get a legendary..
---
My legendary odds are at 0.1920
---
You’re just reaching for karma at this point, we all know who the artist is

That is bcz he has 500+ shelly and he probably lost one trophy because seasin ended
---
Dude for real though. I got 10th place three games in a row with rico a couple days ago, and all my games in the past two maps so far have been me trying to get him back up. The closest I got was one trophy away, so sad
---
Omg that's true
---
I really don’t get how you make these so fast
---
I made a rough guess that he may have moved to one of the new projects of SC game. Because the CEO of SC has confirmed we may see one or two new games in beta hopefully. I don't think he would have moved to just another game.
---
It downloaded on google docs,is that fine 
---
You can make new brawlers. I have ideas but no have materials for this
---
I think
---
This star power potentially has the highest DPS in the game being able to hit 3 brawlers all at one in gem grab, or hit more than 5 brawlers killing all of them in showdown. OP star power is OP 
---
I'm too
---
Couldn’t agree more.
---
Too jumpy

So he should be able to attack while being inside his lamp. right? And the healing won't stop?

It's a community for maps ideas?

I feel like they should make the ammo bar show how long it’ll take until the pickaxe comes back to your hand

lol I got exactly 49 gems but I‘ll probably wait till I unlock my first lvl 9 brawler. Besides that why are so many saying token doublers are better? that‘s just wrong lol and nobody can say me they want to open instat of one mega box, 10 normal boxes haha. Also heard that when carl is released that he will be discounted is it worth to buy him?
---
so much ways to exploit :(
---
I appreciate hand drawn work 😍
---
I don't understand. 
---
No worries your trophies will be added. 
---
Just close the app and open it again. Should be back fine
---
Nice suggestion 
---
The most important tip dont play with randoms. Also another tip, deal chip damage until you get your super and then go sicko mode with your super

Very nice work! I love the style

Dude dont be mad at a game. Yes i understand you but cmon, this game is practically designed for kids and we have adults like KairosTime or OJ playing, which is embarassing tbh. So dont be mad, you'll get through it
---
&gt;Every time you open the box it is supposed to raise your chance for a new brawler
---
It increases every 30 brawl boxes or 10 big boxes or 3 megaboxes.
---
&gt;But if eventually new super rare brawler such as Carl comes up. And I get it very fast due to my chances. Then my legendary chances drop down.
---
I'm not sure about this one but I don't think super rares drop your legendary chances. Only epics, mythics and legendaries affect it.
---
&gt;Therefore if I have all Super Rares then it means nothing goes up
---
Your legendary chance keeps on increasing.

Must be easy as shit to get trophies for him lol

In the right upward corner, press on the 'three dots' drop down option.
---
You will see the option to 'Change User Flair' Option and select the Brawler you want. 
---
A modded version of brawl stars
---
Brawl grinding lotta work
---
I have spike and croe
---
They know you didnt? Then why did they ban your account? Lmao. Look man you cheated somehow for some reason. If you legitimately didnt and have actual proof take them to court. But you wont be able to prove anything. 
---
Removed - Your post is too short, please expand on your title.

This happened to me but with shelly when i was trying to pull a rico

---
wtf, wait this is illegal. 
---
1: your taking this to seriously, and 2: autofire is better for when you need to make a split second decision when someone is point blank and you don't have time to manually aim. So no, I don't think they will take the nerfing Leon part seriously, but I do hope they take the autofire part into mind.

What is ike 😅

As long as it isnt cross platform because i would get bum f_ed by someone with a controller while im on my phone
---
Lmao yeah that's pretty low. In a ranked match that's fine, but shiiit. Use that on events max tokens. Fkin 50000000 
---
Wtf i love crow now
---
If you wanna maximize you're rewards, and use your token doubler efficiently to the max... Then play events. 
---
Dk, dc
---
The best part is, my crow is only level 4
---
Thanks!
---
Barley spike darryl or rico. Depends on who u like and play more
---
Let me guess, OP gemmed both characters and realized they're not insta-win and you actually need skill
---
I was mostly talking about the 2 at the end cz that means the overall tokens OP has till their next box is a weird number, but yeah that too.
---
of that hurts
---
This is what I do...I just need her star power now to really dominate that mode lol.
---
Well, game lore says *despite his age*, so he has to be young enough not be be completely senile but also over middle-age. So I guess that makes the most sense.
---
Bearerest if he unlocks a 3rd
---
Will Smith : Oh thats hot
---
Ricochet must be the best name they could ever come up with
---
Its not only wifi its things like latency and bandwidth and all the nerdy computer stuff. 
---
But yes it needs a fix
---
Top 10 photos taken SECONDS before disaster!
---
I spin to the left and im right handed
---
Level 4 crow :)
---
Barley’s super isn’t that OP anymore. 
---
queria no jogo  bele desenho
---
DAYUM
---
I got a mythic and it took me to 0.04. So I would imagine if you got a legendary it would go even lower. 
---
 I would absolutely love it if you guys could look at my map!
---
Mushroom Castle! What do you guys think about this map? It is a pretty versatile map and it's engaging, with many strategies. Please upvote this post and comment on any additions like spring traps. Teamwork is crucial, gameplay seems decent and it's very skill-based.

---
6k with 16 brawlers :/
---
Not spinning at all &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; right spinning 
---
Oh god ... The 3k hell with retarded POs in every damn match
---
No theres only 5 teams
---
This game is a little to great and everyone needs a break... if you just need a week then cool but whenever I take breaks it’s always a month or two 
---
I heard Supercell were looking for new artist for Brawl Stars have you contacted them. Because you are really talented 
---
Cavern Churn only has a continuous bush in the middle so you know not to go there. But Eye of The Storm is another story.
---
You're lucky enough for people to not notice THIS IS A REPOST
---
He stikes again! Amazing design as always, Kor!
---
It was a this moment he knew he f-ed up
---
TwT
---
hahahahha nice fall
---
Yeah, but Carl only has one. If they are going to bend the rules there, why not do the same for Brock, and give him an extra slot?
---
Noice!
---
Gimme that luck !!
---
He yeets them away
---
I’m surprised they don’t even have trophy road music in the game yet!
---
Please Explain that as if you were explaining it to a new Reddit user... 😂
---
Still, even 1 report per week per player would take in tens of thousands of reports per day and SC would not be able to handle it. 
---
General KenoBULL
---
i got my leon when i had 800 trophies and i didm't know about brawler rarities or amything and i thought that leon is actually pretty weak😂🤣
---
Gedi_kor is fantastic😸
---
I agree with the multiple maps since some maps you might not want to play like Cavern Turn
---
That would be an awesome skin but there is probably lots of copyright issues. :(
---
Yep, he grabbed it. Try it. 
---
Someone posted that earlier 
---
too bad I don't have nitas star power
---
This has been done before, IT IS LITERALLY ONE OF THE TOP POSTS EVER
---
I got Leon pretty early on. But that’s it, no epics or mythics or other legendaries. 
---
welcome! :) 
---
although* was* funny*
---
even though you had a few erors, great comment
---
I have 19/23 brawlers at 5k is that like unreal (No legendarys or Mortis)
---
Yeah bro I know but i did it in the same match and it's amazing. On the other hand i did this kind of plays every Crow game and I wanted to share it
---
Genius 👌🏽
---
Pls tell me this is bait
---
For a mythic or leg?
---
Lol I did that today with mortis.the circle was very small and there was a bull and a shelly...I knew I will lose agains them so I just dashed into the poison by taking only a little bit of damage. Then I come back. Shelly was low and I could just 2 shot her and gg 1st place altho I amost died haha
---
yOu'Re RiGhT sO wInStOn
---
I could max all my brawlers besides gene now if it wernt for a lack of gold lol
---
i reckon you have not learned to check the bush
---
Well what ~characters~ brawlers do you have? I’ve got plenty of tips.
---
Not impossible but very hard  to do. Nice timing.
---
Nope. I don't have Leon. And I have been working hard at Mortis. It is simply a fun meme.
---
Not a map, suggestion for people viewing this page: there are some browser extensions that allow you to just hover your mouse over the image link and see the image without clicking and waiting for the page to load. I just thought it was useful seeing as there are several hundreds of images in this post.
---
Repost this when you got a mythic okay? :p 
---
It would be 50 or 70 tokens?
---
Annoyance and disappointment
---
Piper would be great in this map
---
You should have gotten the Football bull skin and jumped on a jumpad
---
Wdym
---
Too late
---
Barley is my main atm
---
Play solo showdown. Takes some time getting use to the maps but it’s definitely the fastest way to earn trophies and unlock brawlers whether it be brawl boxes or the trophy road.
---
It will sure be good for freetoplays...
---
Colt is Piper's husband
---
i consider pay2play spending €50 or more per month, if you are just a light spender you won't profit too moch off of it
---
Yeah, it's getting annoying
---
i play 1h a day (i don't get that much time to play)
---
Hahahahaha wtf. I've gotten 3 at once before but it was like my first week of playing and I was spending money like crazy. Nice pull OP!!
---
BRUHHH this look amazing
---
The matchmaking is a lot easier at 3000 trophies or below, after that, in showdown you can be placed against anyone above 3000
---
Us barley gangsters use no hat or trans
---
It’s target practice for pipers super. 
---
Barley is at power 4 and 126 trophies. I've been doing solo brawls, and been winning a lot. Same in gems
---
Wow 
---
Gene-ius**
---
Can I get a link to the original post on the right?
---
rico x piper better tho
---
No. He doesn’t need one.
---
In the whole match i ve "say good bye" to 5 dynas, but to be honest i feel bad for the jumping one. 
---
I will try right now, thanks for the info!
---
I'll probably still miss and pull a Bull somehow but it's good to know that it's possible at least!
---
Dont main brawlers. Get them up equally. Its easier to get 4 brawlers to 400 tropys than 1 brawler to that range. Also trophy road rewards are good in the beginning.
---
You should buy skins
---
5 boxes are nothing. You need 2100 boxes to max an account. Lets try this: You get 2 boxes a day from tokens, plus "3 boxes" every 2 days from star tokens. It will take you almost 600 days or almost 2 years of playing every day to max your account. This is taking into account all the tickets, gems, and token duplicators you will get from said boxes.
---
Do you think this sounds reasonable? 2 years of daily playing just to get to enjoy full gameplay?
---
I'm not gonna lie, I love being that third Shelly and wrapping up the remains of the fight.
---
He got Bo before the trophy road update, but not Dynamike.
---
I got spike from a free daily shop chest and didn’t know how rare that was at the time so I was like, “huh, that’s cool I guess.”
---
You know their is actually Jessie porn
---
r/punpatrol
---
Don’t have many skins in mind, I’ll think of it a bit more, thanks 👍
---
That’s nothing. Once I won a brawl ball game in 20 seconds.
---
...I still don't get it
---
Best Brawl Stars meme I've seen 😂
---
No, some big company hire concept artist. I have been in the video game industry for over 10 years now ( not as concept artist ;)) but it’s prety common to see some Concept artist position. (And yeah no formation are required, just a hugeeee talent :) )
---
Sniper and assassin meta regarding gem grab and brawl ball maybe. Shelly still dominates most solo showdown maps
---
Yes. You can pull brawlers in Boxes, but you cnat get skins 😉
---
That‘s true. Right now at around 3k pretty much everyone plays bo lol
---
You: *doesnt have dynamike but has bo*
---
Trophy road system: Am I a joke to you 
---
Yea very true 😂 I’ll probably do that, thanks 
---
No 
---
Or dynamike
---
Or bo (im like 90% sure his bombs break bushes I could be wrong tho)
---
 &gt;or dynamike
---
&gt;or bo (im like 90% sure his TNTs break bushes i could be wrong tho)

Thanks for the suggestion 
---
I would assume at 10k you are pretty much maxed out anyway
---
Double kill?
---
Yes 😞
---
you took a pic of a screenshot, being taken....

It’s hard to get super that quick. Before that poison clouds take you out.

Thanks. Do u know what map it is?

I will rather uninstall brawl stars😂🤣

Perfectly balanced, as all things should be

I love the indirect spike flex lol

Where do I make a map 
---
Is it a website or is it an app

Hehe, olá. ^^

don't, his fault for being a poor sport and trying to take advantage of the situation. He probably also spins when he kills people so you've only done a service

😔

For me it‘s more like: lose 50 trophies to earn your star tokens on gem grab and bounty, ülay solo sd till youve earned them back

Yes 😞😔
