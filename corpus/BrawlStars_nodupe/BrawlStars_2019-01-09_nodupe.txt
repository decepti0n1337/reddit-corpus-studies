I think that arm is extremely long. But nice work
---
Sorry, I just thought it was cool. I didn't mean to offend anyone. I mean, the credit can be seen if you click on their post, I thought that was ok
---
this is a well made map, ranged brawlers would definitely excel
---
thank you. i‚Äôve seen so many posts about people complaining 
---
Stop using auto aim then.....and life leech is good, makes you actually do something instead of camping bushes for the entire match.
---
Are you a new global kid?
---
What kind of question if that rico fires more shots plus the damage on rico increases with every bounce
---
Join Darryl cult. Not big at all but still. If you want to join go ahead!
---
Maybe chili a bit?
---
Okay, but anyone could take someone else's artwork and call it a new brawler. I do agree that it would be cool to have some kind of volcano brawler, though.
---
ahem allow me r/woooosh
---
no, but I'm pretty sure a sd map is dropping next week
---
Sa... Nevermind
---
Thanks! I spent a while editing it, but it was surprisingly easy. iMovie all on iPhone 7, just exported it to PC and added audio then.
---
Yeee. Off a regular box, wasn‚Äôt expecting it at all. I got 0 epics and 0 mythicals, so I was expecting one of those. 
---
Agree, some players, like me, who played a lot of Brawl Stars, having these kinds of modes are fun, adds more colours to the game
---
But please it‚Äôs dancing * there‚Äôs no e 
---
nice! you should make a YT channel for this
---
Mortis: S tier in brawl ball, F tier in every other game mode
---
this is the one showdown mode where nobody teams

You see it in brawl ball
---
Hello Nader, nice comment
---
Sorry, my english is not my mother language. Thanks for the correction by the way
---
I guess you're right, so, I won't post anything like that again. And yeah! Super cool
---
What it does!!!!!
---
And no bo buff srsly?
---
Just right know there was one player who just stood and shot.
---
I can he just made something to push every 2-3 seconds.
---

---
Need a report button! 
---
*bow
---
Piper getting piped! 
---
I'm going to assume you're not playing against any motis that are above 400 trophies. There are really really good players who play mortis.
---
ive never seen anyone team on it even at &gt;500
---
It‚Äôs alright man my bad haha :)
---
Yeah same here
---
You are just a boss bro!!!
---
It a Furry
---
Thank you, kind anonym sir of the internet
---
Idk, he played like a newbie, prob been carried here.
---
Not a fan of Darryl, but this guide is helpful.
---
Maybe a slight bull speed and range buff would help
---
I think some parts of Mortis needs a buff, while others need a nerf and he needs the property of being able to slide along walls instead of being immediately cut off. This way, the skill cap will be lowered so that more people would be able to play Mortis well, and the pros don't get and overpowered character.
---
But clearly some character are going to be more affected than others, it's not black and white. I'm sure the balance team are keeping in mind that just like in fighting games, buffing say the speed of a slow move set can reveal that the character mechanics are fundamentally strong and needs to be balanced with more care. 
---
What do you want his rework to look like
---
üòÇ 
---
I also feel like he should be able to shoot and move faster after rolling, since that miniscule delay can make you die
---
Why?
---
Mines 69
---
Me in a nutshell
---
Perzival, Congrats on being one of the top players for so long! Awesome video, and yeah...Mortis needs a damage buff to at least his regular attack.
---
Sorry man
---
If Brawl Stars is now Global, why do I not see it in my app store?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Mortis definitely needs a buff on his range
---
only need legendaries so this is accurate
---
Darryl for me need only few HP more. The others are good proposes.
---
I mean if you customize the size you might need to separate the buttons because if you have your super  ready and the customized the buttons then the super button and the main attack button might be touching each other and you might not want to use your super but accidentally use it but i guess supercell could fix that so they cant touch each other
---
Late reply but
---
`&lt;c#&gt;12&lt;c#&gt;3&lt;/c&gt;`
---
That's 15 characters.
---
You can also eschew the closing tag and another color
---
`&lt;c9&gt;r&lt;c2&gt;e&lt;c8&gt;d` will show up `9&gt;r2&gt;e8&gt;d` in game but [like this at the end of a match](https://i.imgur.com/OFCuB4W.jpg)
---
Hes not even close to a heavyweight. They have almost 2k more hp. He's closer to mortis, which is an assassin. It's almost like they accidentally typed heavyweight 
---
These randomness don't belong here 
---
It belongs here r/aaaaaupisnumberone r/funnyfart r/FreeForAllSubreddit 
---
Please don‚Äôt nerf Leon :( at least rework? IMO he is powerful but he is boring and ik if they nerf him he will suck balls 
---
Maybe you should wait until the next balance changes before deciding which one you should get.
---
Nice job sorry about these asshole treating u like shit anyways how many trophies do u have with el primo? 
---
I feel you bro. Spent 300$ and got nothing üòì
---
*Laughs in Frank*
---
As a Mortis main, I like
---
Oh wow
---
For a crocodile, the super and star power don‚Äôt fit. Super: big chomp. Star power: paralyse
---
If you dont want skins you uses your gems in tickets or doublers to get more boxes.
---
What were some ideal comps with Mortis? I usually play a variation of Mortis/Tara, trying to lock in a 3rd. My teammates and I tried Frank for the 3rd and that felt good.
---
Hmm Death Valley 
---
Or yah know, noobs (*cough*gemers*cough*) can just git good. Star powers give some hero‚Äôs such a big advantage, especially against other power 5 or 6 hero‚Äôs.
---
Only thing good about landscape was.....
---
oh wait Auto-Aim was and still is pretty bad.
---
There was nothing good about landscape.
---
the game mod gives you extra hp back for dealing damage, read the goddamn mode info
---
Dynamike skin. It makes Dynamike look different.
---
God, another post about it...
---
**FAN ART**. As simple as that
---
Barley
---
I'm gonna guess that when bo is poisoned by crows daggers, it recognizes the life leach damage to be the same as crows poison damage making it so you heal extra 37 heaths during the tics if life leach. 
---
team Ryan 4 lyfe
---
its gameplay under 300, ur using a maxed darryl...in the video you have a shit ton of mistakes and u still win because everyone else is so bad...its just a bad example of how to use darryl imo
---
Look for people your trophy count. I can understand why people would reject your join/invite requests. I'm at 11k and I only really play with either people I know, or people around my trophy count. Try to do the same. Look for a good club/band, and play with ur clubmates. I personally would recommend Frost, only partially because I'm good buddies with the leaders there, and they have many noob clubs. 
---
49 gem mega boxes give more value than a Key Doubler. lol
---
The negativity from landscape was much more secluded to the subreddit. The rest of social media was about 50/50 from what I remember. 
---
yeah same
---
What? People can fake reveals...
---
Penny is a super rare 
---
The 400 trophy thing should be the bottom one. They are the people that mess up the mm
---
Oh boy we actually have a threat to Jonnyboy.... maybe?
---
You don‚Äôt have to be such an idiot I never saw those ANOTHER POSTS ! 
---
Leon needs a slower projectile speed
---
Love the map. However there should be no one tile gaps. It's really hard to get through and supercell doesn't ever put them in the game. If you redesign it without 1-tile wide gaps, it's great
---
Mortis‚Äô range is sort of his quirk, and it‚Äôs been nerfed enough already. And such a large damage buff would break him (that‚Äôs 100%, not 50%).
---
Carried hard
---
I just downloaded this app. It‚Äôs name is in the bottom left of the post (forgot what it‚Äôs called). I‚Äôd love to see your meme though!
---
It's allowed for randoms, I assume to simplify the matchmaking process
---
Hehe 420 gems
---
F
---
37 health is for his poison damage. Crow does damage, and then 4 ticks of poison
---
Unless you have a Brawler you **really really** ***really*** have a Brawler you want to upgrade, I would highly suggest not to buy the offer. It's a rip-off for the most part.
---
-theyre redoing all the models, why is everyone complaining about bo...theyve already said theyre working on it
---
-mortis should get a rework not a buff, mortis is super good in brawl ball but complete trash in everything else
---
- leons super still needs a nerf wtf why would they buff his super??
---
Good idea, and i hope you were fooling around with the numbers, because this could make noobs feel like they are pro when they aren't
---
Did you mean beartiful?
---
Our team plays gem grab with Mortis and I can assure is OP in any map
---
That's how mafia works
---
What problem are you trying to show here?
---
I've found so many people at 300 total trophies with like 90% of it on one character while being paired against people around 13k+ trophies total... matchmaking got worse if anything.
---
throwers sit there and just got straight shot to safe 
---
Oh ok
---
Crow is gaining more health than it should. He's gaining 200 health for the daggern, 50 health for the poison and an extra 37.
---
Carefully watch the video please and you'll notice.
---
Throwers stand there and thy can hit the safe
---
Oh ok. Yeah that needs to be fixed
---
When Jessie invites you over for lunch
---
Ahh yes picking a ‚Äúhero‚Äù. Not brawler 
---
Lol i got Leon from a crate without using money on the game 
---
Hiding in bushes to stay invisible and stall or bush camping?
---
Still waiting for the Leon offer. I guess it's invisible.
---
I want all
---
Oh he is most definitely a penis. No doubt there.
---
Mafia works
---
Free brawl box it was a thing for a while like the free chest in clash royal 
---
No I want my Leon to stay broken /s
---
Very minor bug: https://youtube.com/watch?v=hkQX9KOst-s
---
DJ Khaled: Suffering from Success
---
Uh... He did get star player.
---
Lol that‚Äôs the point 
---
I understand, and I do see that perspective too. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm only asking for a mere skin/logo, something that has no effect on skill, just to make people who‚Äôve been playing longer feel a little special :)
---
Barley's super will cover the whole map
---
How do you check your odds??
---
Crow isn't hard to play. His stats are just weak currently. All you have to learn with Crow is similar to other brawlers (positioning, use of super etc.) You don't even have to learn to aim
---
[removed]
---
I opened 5 mega boxes in a row and didn't get any brawlers, I'm at 2800 and been playing for a month.
---
In the shop in the big box info
---
For sure. I don't get why ppl claim that he is ok and we should play better when he is an assassin that doesn't have burst damage, you have to be right next to the opponent to deal max damage, DoT is slow last nothing and the damage done by it goes away with one tick of Auto-refresh, the special is hard to charge and use wrongly can be a suicide, have one of the lowest health pool in the game and have about the same speed as leon. Crow excels at nothing  despite the fact he is the perhaps only DoTer right now. He needs that buff!
---
Barely should be on there
---
*but... there was a nicer way of saying that... there‚Äôs no good reason to be a dick to someone*
---
And you sacrifice the length of your name. Not the best tradeoff if you ask me.
---
tbh, I felt carried. Pretty sure i was, still a noob but i'll learn how to play good soccer.
---
Why am i cringing at this masterpiece
---
I knew I wasn‚Äôt the only one, had at the time more time for brawl stars than clash, after a month I deleted clash royal and didn‚Äôt look back, never been better
---
While true, you should (and MUST) mention that its because the game prefers faster matchmaking to accurate matchmaking.
---
I mean, for a guy who mains, damn that's impressive.
---
[Humor] Great post
---
G A Y vibes coming from this

If you find one please let me know because I also want to join one

Join a club and play with people you know are good

That‚Äôs like every 3 seconds...?

play solo then
---
you need glasses
---
So supercell should get rid of spinning? üíÄ
---
Nah parzival, he‚Äôs also really good as an assassin in gem. Ppl think he can only kill throwers, but he also can easily kill rico, brock, Jessie, Penny, piper, and even tara.
---

I‚Äôve been trying to do this since soft launch

You team

maybe get gud and not be trash lol

now this...

Ik 2 parzival. R u the one I talked to on disc? Or do u have like 6K in cr?

Don‚Äôt give them idea lol we should keep them focused on this game. Lol üòù

mortis is lit maybe u should get gud and stop dying lol

That‚Äôs how brawl stars works*

But a skilled player can use his super wisely to get the edge

Oh u got proof big guy?

Bad matchmaking

I have discord, but no I don‚Äôt talk very often except IRL friends. I had about 5.4k in royale before season reset.
---
How‚Äôd ya know it‚Äôs me?
---
Dude I did the exact same thing. I left my clan and started playing brawlstars instead of clash. Just got too monotone once you hit 4000+ trophies
---
Maybe Thousand Lakes.

i looked at your posts

Oh right, also tell Flynny he got me banned.

Wooden garbage barrel

After 500 trophies you will be stuck unless you're OP. I'm sorry dude... 
---
I think the best way to nerf Leon is by slowing down his unload speed. Maybe same speed as Darryl. So that he can't just melt tanks from the triple tap. 
---
agreed
---
I cannsee only 1 picture ü§î
---
I know but it‚Äôs disproportionally these players. 
---
TL;DR: Mortis is bad gem carrier above 400 trophies, play aggressively without picking up gems, and apply pressure to the opponents.
---
I just watched Ready Player One on my flight
---
It happens to me on stream
---
Probability to find any 1 mising mithyc +any 1 missing epic = epic chance\*mithyc chance.

Do the math :)

I'd like to see a laser in-game.

I want Bo remake, Leon rework/ Nerf &amp; buff and especially Mortis buff! 
---
Btw i don't see why Darryl and Crow should get a buff, they are altready awesome brawler and Crow altready got a buff.
---
Shooty mc stabby

It feels really great being a part of this game's beta stage and helping it to achieve success! Thank you too supercell for making this awesome game. Can't stop playing it&lt;3‚ù§Ô∏è
---
i‚Äôve heard that supercell said that color names are not against tos. which probably is why colors have stayed since soft launch and have never been removed up until now
---
I‚Äôm sure people on reddit are intelligent enough to figure it out 
---
No... I‚Äôm fairly sure that‚Äôs just make up... like how all the ladies make their eyes on fleek

Get barley to the safe. ult. win.

When that stops working...

Get barley CLOSE to the safe. ult. win.

That not working either?

Push the enemy team back first, then get barley to the safe. ult. win.
---
Can't seem to push the enemy back? Get barley to the safe. ult. win.
---
That  last strategy doesn't make sense? Then Get barley to the safe. ult. win.

Kose nanat

Yeah but a lot use the template, even like Nita and mortis Jessie and Shelly all have it! just not filled in white is what I‚Äôm saying 
---
What band are you in?
---
Tribe gaming
---
Well, star power as a 1% chance which is pretty high. In about 70 boxes you've the 50% chance to have already found it. 
---
Proba\[find at least 1 star power out of 70 boxes\] = 1 - (1-0.01)\^70 = 0.5
---
Never got to play portrait sadly
---
I also have an iphone xs and i get no lag whatsoever. Matchmaking places people with similar ping in the same game to make the game fair. But ping is not the same as phone lag. That means pairing up with someone who has good ping won‚Äôt improve your game quality. Your problem is probably poor connection / bad wifi

Nita plushie is more cute than spike, Change my mind. Jk tho Would love to buy both üòç

Yeah Shelly is a real bitch for Mortis. Not much I can do against em. I‚Äôm mostly upset with the Franks tho, the stun has too much range and breaking all those boxes is essentially an instagoal.

I look forward to seeing you on the pitch again soon!

I would kill for your free reward dude, you‚Äôre lucky

That reply makes way more sense. Yes, indeed, I am aware of it, and I can agree that all these newbies are so hard to deal with and can ruin the fun easily, especially when you go on those unlucky losing strikes. 
---
Thanks fam!
---
Music name pls
---
I got super lucky a week ago and got spike at .13%.you can definetely get there! 
---
Great on gem grab and brawl ball,her super is what makes her special,getting 2 brawlers will automatically recharge her super,u can use her super on someone who has 10 gems or 2 brawlers in brawl ball to make an opening for your team mates to score.
---
isnt that the crazy expensive phone from Samsung?
---
Bad opponents?
---
I m at 8000 with 19 brawlers, I still don‚Äôt have any legendaryüò≠üò≠
---
My Tara is almost lvl 9. Lets say I get her star power right after hitting 9. Can I get any other star powers from boxes right after that? Or does a specific star 
---
 power only qualify for chance when you have that brawler at lvl 9 and you do not have a star power.
---
Someone said to get a brawler to lvl 9 so you "unlock" star powers. As in you just keep getting them after hitting lvl 9 once.
---
I would like Leon and Spike one, Nita too, Shelly also.. ok I want them all
---
Im 500 and i havent seen a team on life leach
---
To hot we go
---
Ive had constant token doubles and at this point, I am not getting points fast enough for one brawler. I saw it in the shop today and I ended up getting it. Funny to I put it on Tara. I just want to get a star power. WIthout this, it will take months.
---
Dug*
---
Ya missed the goal when firing. The ball is bigger than the line, it's misleading..the edge of the ball hit the wall.
---
More creepy than weird, didn't notice it before, not going to be able to sleep at nights. :)
---
They want to team with you
---
That‚Äôs what you would call teaming 
---
Ikr
---
  She is very good at controlling maps with her super, if you get perfect super and get like entire enemy team its easy win. 
---
   Best at Brawl Ball, Gem Grab, and decent in Showdown (because of ulti stun and you can team up with others) and good in Double SD.
---
    She is a mid ranged brawler, but if you want to max out dmg potential you have to get closer to the enemy, the ulti can help you with it because stun.
---
   Otherwise she is a great character and not that hard at all, just you need to know when to throw your ulti and thats all.
---
You didn't bully that evil Shelly hard enough shellies have been fuckin me over every time I get near 200 with dyna
---
Don't be greedy, we need balance changes more than a bottle that you can't even see in game

What?

Way to kill your teammates smpphh

Lol with $1000 it looks like. I would hope he did.

Yea i got to try it out early, their foldable phone is truly impressive.
---
Pretty nice.. you make cool suggestions, but the spelling mistakes are mildly infuriating
---
Wrong. It‚Äôs barley and crow
---
Thanks so much!
---
Ps how did u put the character next to ur name?
---
Okey maybe, cant talk for crow since i dont own any legendaries
---
I agree with dis guy
---
Song?
---
Folder 2 or Folder 3?
---
Ah ok thanks that explains everything 
---
Being stuck trophy wise is okay for me, it just means I need to improve my game, as long as improving your game will be still fun it‚Äôs all okay. I just hope many brawlers will be still viable if you have them in a bit of a lower level
---
Dude, I don‚Äôt know you. How am I supposed to know that you knew any of these things? If all I see is someone posting a subreddit that makes no sense I‚Äôm just going to assume they don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre doing.  There is absolutely nothing to point to you post be sarcastic.
---
I got both mythics too, but can't get a Piper for some reason
---
I got pocos offer two and it annoys me so much as it will stay there for 4 fucking days while im still waiting for a leon offer
---
They are talking about 300-400 trophys per brawler and not overall trophys. Its a huge diifferent since matchmaking is based on brawler trophy not overall trophys. For me under 300 trophys (per brawler) is low ranking and above is average. 
---
Damn yeah ahaha fighting spike is the worst tho
---
It‚Äôs not against the rules. 
---
He hot
---
Ah ok thanks 
---
I'm the worst leon player in history i bet
---
Dude How come you manage to play on this phone üòÇüíî Also I forgot Samsung flip phones exists
---
He used to have bigger health and his super was way longer too. Now he‚Äôs weaker but the super is more manageable (also passively charging)
---
Would prefer this 
---
Lol yeah ahaha i got mortis to 320 in solo showdown (without life leech) just running around
---
No

I bought the last pp with coins i‚Äôm jealous

He used to be a heavyweight, and they just forgot to edit it

Nice Jinx skin remake, bro.
---
*victory
---
Leon New Skin LEAKED?!?!?!!!??!!??
---
This was before the game even went landscape.
---
His attack speed could be quicker and his super could be like so he can only hit 1-2 hits
---
Thank you for mortis! He is so weak now
---
tbh on my OnePlus 6T playing brawl stars doesn't affect my battery much...
---
Barley is so accurate 
---
Alternatively you can also look at his trophies and deduce the same thing
---
Colt already does more damage. He received a damage buff recently.
---
Should have let him die in peace.
---
Me
---
Nope 
---
no unfortunately 
---
Supercell h8s me so much
---
You‚Äôre funny
---
True
---
pnly the penny skin?
---
Gameüëèreviewüëè
---
I don't own mortis but from experience he's pretty good at scooping up ur gems/power points
---
Well he‚Äôs a weak Aggro. Just because you can play him good doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs a good brawler. A lot of aggro brawlers counter mortis.
---
Leaving my comment here before this blows up
---
And what happen with the points remaining?
---
r/iamverysmart 
---
well, one third of it was buying brawlers from offers. I had the luck to get special offers for all the mythics, super rare and epics. But I‚Äôve unlocked absolutely nothing from boxes &gt;.&lt;
---
üòé
---
I wish i could nazi this picture ever again
---
The is
---
I don‚Äôt think Darryl needs a buff but the rest of them - U ARE WAY TOO PRECISE!
---
Screenshot. Send to flip phone. Open sideways as shown. ‚ÄúPlaying brawl stars on a flip phone‚Äù
---
I saved these in a day while my exams are going on
---
Yeah it's better to duo instead of teaming in solo showdown 
---
Also buff Rico! And nerf El Primo and Bull so that they don't dominate showdown!
---
I like the nimblebit style of characters!
---
Don't post such sd teaming clips...it just makes the community toxic.
---
Btw. I hate teaming in sd too, so #stopthespin !
---
With me the problem wasn't landscape it was that tap to shoot was gone and auto aim came
---
Leon is already inside, and the enemy is dead. 
---
I agree but I‚Äôd team but backstab instantly when I get close enough to stop people from teaming.
---
Patrick is the representation of Leon...
---
Maybe don‚Äôt use inappropriate language. 
---
Star power for 169 gems.  And it is a discount.  Supercell did great job on how we can spend gems cus they think we have too much gems and we have no idea whem to spend them
---
What do you think are good buffs for Darryl?
---
Hey samir my man :)
---
Wow lots of detail. I should‚Äôve paid more attention back then but I just remember that I hated it because I‚Äôd maxed out piper and she was much harder to play post update
---
Darryl should be that random dude with the iron butt, I can't remember what episode it's from... 
---
lol its fake
---
Oh hell naw
---
Aw hell yes
---
no it‚Äôs on Twitter
---
Vbucks 
---
i know but its fake account
---
Nothing to do. Wait 2 days then, and what a good friend you have.. That's so stupid and funny at the same time.
---
Mortis is meant to be creepy as fuck, not like the weird skin he has. This is pure masterpiece and i give it a 10/10.
---
He spells it right in the first suggestion lmao, then spells it wrong
---
Oh yaüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Lol, why didn't you just use your super on the ball to get it in the goal? xD
---
Yep,my bad
---
Thanks man 
---
One step forward two step back rofl
---
I literally made this meme a month ago
---
How much trophies did you get after 6 hours?
---
Yep
---
But I never face players with a high trophy difference tho. Why is this surcharge a huge prob for lots of people
---
I feel like that Leon Nerf is super harsh. Also, I don't think Shelly really needs a buff, seeing as she can get an ungodly amount of damage out with her super. And I think instead of a damage buff, Darryl should have his spread slightly tightened.
---
No they don't. Your brawler definitely wasn't maxed then or the amount of powerpoints you got was exactly what was needed to upgrade(some shop deals have the exact amount of powerpoints needed to max the Brawler).
---
Wow
---
Ok thanks
---
I'm not sure, but you can probably find out with your leaderboard and go to local. If it has the first  2 letters of your country, you're fine and it's Supercell's fault, not yours. 
---
Or you can just see in the title he says ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fairly new here‚Äù lol???
---
i don‚Äôt understand why you are insisting, i told you, i did it today and the remaining power disappears
---
/r/woooosh
---
Actually touch flip phones exist. Even if there's no fucking reason to buy one.
---
No point.
---
Go to settings and and press on help and support then press contact us
---
Maybe second account :/
---
Yeah, of course they do... But you need to be lucky to get one.
---
Will take you approximately 4 Weeks until you most likely get one. Maybe u get it way earlier, maybe way later. 
---
Me too, I have every brawler except Leon, so I‚Äôm waiting for him more than a month. But any legendary offer wasn‚Äôt came out after update.
---
Current Gem Grab is not the best for Primo and Poco tho
---
On that map they can but brawlers can snipe 'em over the river.
---
[deleted]
---
Dis Brawl Stars
---
Yeah but still
---
Also lol I was the Bull right there
---
Rank 8  113/120
---
Unless You Main One Brawler, Don't Do It
---
But is it sure u'll get one?
---
Yo pienso que crow tendria que sacar 4 dagas en vez de trs y que el da√±o no aumente, porque la verdad que haga menos de 1000 de da√±o es algo que un legendario estaria fatal( quando es nivel 1)y que a nivel maximo como maximo quite los 100 justos
---
What do you do with shelly in life leech mode? Ahahah 
---
Maybe because of Chinese New year on 5th feb
---
It's the end of camping and teaming

---
And you have Frank... Boi I have 2,5k and still no Frank in Sight, vecause I got stupid Mortis dropping my rate yesterday instead of getting my first epic at all... 
---
Explain it a bit more. What's the goal? How many players per team? How many teams? Why the gamemode is difficult/unique?
---
Y do u even want to know dis? üòè
---
Kind of yes kind of no.
---
I don‚Äôt know the exact number of drops that you‚Äôre expected to get from a box but I think buying key doublers gets you more value for your gems. 
---
But on the other it‚Äôs all for one brawler, so maybe when you don‚Äôt have any brawlers level 9 yet it might be worth it to get one closer to level 9, because getting a star power from a chest saves you 2000 keys.
---
But really, just buy skins, can only get those with gems.
---
The probability to be that unlucky is 13.4% :)
---
Wdym Morris is good
---
Yeah, this has gone to trash since global. Even a bit before, I think the mods have completely given up. 
---
no tara needs a buff you dummy
---
Yeah this is exactly right. We shouldn‚Äôt base nerfs/buffs based on what the elite players of a certain character can do. 
---
Dont worry, its just paint 3D
---
Ur supers weren‚Äôt great, u missed a ton of ur shots cuz u spammed auto aim, u made some terrible decisions during the fight against bull and only won because bull was an idiot 
---
Also this one is btw :)
---
No, the difference is that on the other map, they could reach it while being completely protected. This map involves actual risk. It‚Äôs not that hard to keep people away in this map.

Except for tickets. Even if you only get an average of 30 tokens per ticket in robo, it's ~4.44 gems per box when buying the 80 gem pack of tickets.

How what? To get all the legendaries with $100 bundle?  
---
That's 2000 gems, the legendary offers seem to range from 450-750 depending if they come with more than just the legendary(extra power points and such).    
---
Wait for the offers and spend ~550 gems per legendary, or 1650 gems. You won't instantly get them, just gotta be patient with the offers.
---
what is your legendary pull chance?  Mine is currently 0.24 and it hasn't moved in like 20 boxes.

Bull‚Äôs speed is 770 not 700
---
But fallout boy is a band, and vault boy is the meme...
---
In my opinion Darryl does not need a buff I‚Äôm closing in on 500 trophies with him at level 8 I don‚Äôt see him as needing a buff
---
Thank you so much! This changed my vision about Daryl! he's so fun to play now!
---
:D
---
head needs to be about 70% bigger
---
i would think calling someone mentally retarded for playing a game in a way they enjoy is pretty toxic ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
---
Well, this trophies were gained in randoms. But the main comp was barley, bull and a colt. When the bull crossed the map by his ut for the enemies chest, the other team got distracted by him, so I went really close to the chest and used barley's ut, dealing like 40 to 50% of damage to enemy's safe.  I played 30 matches with the same randoms, so the tactic worked out in almost all the matches and paid of for me in 103 trophies. ;V
---
Very nice bro but im at 9.4k f2p
---
Just saying
---
I know it's useless, but is would be fun af. At least for me
---
Btw sorry if quality is bad :)
---
Same bro, I met 2 randoms also, n end up gaming 112 trophies. 
---
honestly losing trophies makes not want to play the game. its like strictly competitive 
---
You think he enjoyed?? He literally threw the game at our spawn place and shooting the air thinking there is no chance of winning. If he is not mentally retarded then what is he?
---
Well I‚Äôm just saying there are a lot of these post that I‚Äôll scroll through daily and it‚Äôs just like wow a lot of people are doing this!
---
Stop playing Shelly, shes no-skill
---
Now my primo is rank 20 thanks to those 2 randomsüòÜ
---
This brings me joy
---
Its kind of my style
---
Star Shelly is a reward for global players before 2019 not OBs
---
you did? Sorry, probably didn't see.
---
I know like when I check my feed and I see two memes a day about people getting killed by bull and teammates with 10 gems for like 4 fucking weeks it's annoying. You might as well be reposting. It was kind of funny the first time

Can‚Äôt seem to find you lol
---
You‚Äôve been matched up with this individual for 80% of your game?  Or is it that the players you match with aren‚Äôt at the same skill level; and it upsets you?  80% of your games aren‚Äôt filled with trolls; that‚Äôs statistically impossible; but if you‚Äôre annoyed by players under your skill level, then try either finding people to play with or solo showdown. 
---
I don't kno what that is cuz u kno retarded
---
It‚Äôs an example, and one that you seem to understand given that that‚Äôs the only thing you could come up with as a rebuttal.
---
True... Its my favorite special event mode yet.
---
So one tricking is your issue? I mean that guy is allowed to play the game however he likes
---
Here. But I don‚Äôt believe they take suggestions too often. 
---
I don't want to be negative but these types of memes have been posted dozens of times. Please steer clear of repeated memes
---
Sucks to be you

---
A Finnish company at it's best. 
---
I have a real life crow as a profile pic,also my bad it is @goku_too_op
---
Exactly
---
This game isn't filled with trolls. But if you say trolls who are 1000 trophy by only pushing 3 brawlers high then yes. 80% of the game. Supercell doesn't even want to fix this shitty system by pairing us with total trophies of account if passed 300 trophy
---
I want one!
---
Leon is the worst one if we are judging by appearance
---
It‚Äôs sent :)
---
And that he is how the game is toxic. And no normal logically thinking human would do this knowing that it is disadvantageous to himself and his teammates and only bring hatred to themselves
---
Doesn‚Äôt the shop reset on the same time regardless of your time zone tho
---
It would be good a casual mode, just for fun. Losing trophies stresses, there are times I do not play because the internet and matchmaking sucks, so I do not want to lose trophies because of it.
---
It's a video game...you're acting like he's driving on the left side of the lane. 
---
HAHA, TEAMING BAD
---
There are tryhards in everything 
---
Because he is bad loser? Knowing he himself is the problem of losing but never wanted to improve himself
---
Do u have all the mythicals.
---
How ya'll gonna downvote this guy.  That was funny. 
---
I love heist it‚Äôs my favorite game mode but it‚Äôs Queue is not fun. I play bull on heist and I queue up alone which means I don‚Äôt have a full team. I think the queue is more worried about fast queues because I get teams with 200/300 less trophies on my team vs 3 brawlers 600 trophies each. I hate this as it‚Äôs not a fair game then. I have never won a game with someone at this level that has 200-300 trophies.  Please do something about that.
---
Anyone got an explanation?
---
Let‚Äôs focus on getting reports for teaming first
---
This game has no endgame there‚Äôs no point in rushing there dumbshit pay to winner
---
Armenia
---
I also have no bias and Crow is *definitely not* the only legendary I have. 
---
Maybe he had lag? Maybe he is trolling? 
---
Tbh players like these who don't even play are pretty rare. Most of the randoms are still pretty good at the game.
---
This sub have so much garbage post. All i see is meme. Really disappointed.

God, you don't even try anymore. I mean, this is low effort even for a meme
---
Even against Leon, if you don‚Äôt have super he can win, and he can two shot mortis if he auto aims at the right times.
---
maybe the music was too much lol
---
But where is leon?
---
ffs Im at 3600 trophies and I still don't have ANY epics or above. AMA.
---
2 problems:
---
1) What of none of you can break walls?
---
That game will never end, and just imagine that, playing gem grab but literally not being able to win so you‚Äôre just messing around.
---
2) Dynamike with star power, it‚Äôs too powerful. 
---
But I also kind of like the idea, I want to know what sort of comps people will come up with. But idk both problems could maybe be fixed but I don‚Äôt see this happening. Maybe as a special event, though?
---
Basically people should stop complaining about brawler levels. A person whom let's say managed to push a lvl 1 brawler to 500 is seen to be more skilled compared to another people who pushed a lvl 10 brawler to 500. With that in mind, it is perfectly reasonable to match a 169 trophy non max brawler with a 171 trophy max brawler since they should be around the same skill range
---
It doesn‚Äôt cost 1000$ if you take it on a contract plan.
---
I subscribed 2 days ago and added a couple of RES filters to get rid of requests, fanart and other useless crap. The subreddit is now dead for me :(
---
I‚Äôll join 2281 trophies and always online

Yeah man, there are some randoms that are dumb. It's a big risk to play with randoms, bu I personally had a lot of luck. Bet you gain your trophies back, dude. :'(

---
I'm very clear that matchmaking is based of trophies not just based on the highest trophy level of brawler. My entire analogy is there just because OP had to make a stupid lame ass post about matchmaking needing to be done based on brawler levels that I wanted to come up with a different analogy just to debunk his stupid post and many other posts that literally contribute nothing to this reddit community other that showcasing the intense level of whining new brawl stars players have. The entire analogy is just for fun and not to be taken seriously.
---
Also, the teammates that OP has have higher trophies and lower power levels. By my analogy it means that they are more skilled than the opponents. In that case OP'S team should technically faceroll the opponent based on player skill alone.

One PP for Piper? Pathetic Supercell...
---
You are not yourself when you are hungry!! He can play the game how he wants to play. 
---
Before, Crow was OP because of his super charge rate is so fast, but even at that time his HP and damage are still one of the lowest. I think a damage buff will make him truly a threat even without his super!
---
Knowing that it brings hatred to himself?
---
I agree, but you said it in a harsh way
---
Except she's a shotgunner. Shelly is supposed to hide and flank people like dynamike who she shouldn't be engaging in long range. In close-medium range, a Shelly with an ult is the most powerful thing on the entire map. Also nerfing all of his attacks by a percentage would be better than just taking away a shot. Also his ult is meh, it doesn't really need a change.
---
That is smart flip phone 
---
Which is an oxymoron 
---
Dynamike is strong on high ranking if you watch him play. Also he uses his regulear attack and cant attack during the air what makes his starpowrr potential lot less got but still one of the best starpowers in game
---
Yes he is a dataminer 
---
Gotta get use dat money
---
I don‚Äôt think they have to be new concepts just a new take on them like Shelly stuns so she can get close and do damage whereas Frank is more of a crowd control
---
They datamine the game
---
It's 600LBS_BOI 
---
So how does it really work i just see my self going accidentally trough some random wall or would there jus appear a forth button where to activate that ability?
---
I got where you coming from but that ability alone is just insanly strong in alot different games and i dont think it will be added anytime soon, i least i hope. I dont want any brawler that is on same power lvl as invisible kid, hitting behind corners, or a living healing station. 
---
Look at his pp. Personally, I found it easiest to put my pp in everyone available at least to 6. That way you can feel out each character and understand them better. It seems like he has the option to only put pp in the ones he likes. That's fine I guess but it takes money to be so selective.
---
Yep. It is so annoying
---
Ok but the question is, what other possibilities of battle should be introduced in the game? 
---
That is 70 thousand people
---
It's the fact that Crows only try to attack you once every few seconds to poison you and if you try to attack them, they run away.
---
I am online right now, my ign is JustinJTX
---
I‚Äôve thought about verticality but that might be hard to implement into the game.
---
You can't compare him to other shotgunners, he is not played like them
---
I was thinking, when it's fully charged up there could be a bar above your health or something to indicate it's fully charged. When it IS fully charged you don't need to activate it, you can walk through one set of walls and then the bar resets. There wouldn't need to be a third button, as soon as the ability is ready, you can walk through one wall and after you've walked through it, it recharges without needing activation. Hope that makes sense!
---
Good point. They should fix this 
---
Good ol camping Bull 
---
Ooh for bo what they could do is keep his attack but his ult charges really quick and it only throws 1 mine(the mine would do more damage) that will explode after 5 sec(?) or if someone gets to close. His star power would be that his mines will give him sight in the same size of a normal sight range and his own sight is still the same 
---
Jordan 
---
I was thinking now of someone capable of summoning more than one turret/creature at the same time, even with his main attack being very weak for it not to be top strong
---
I highly doubt that they would add jailbreak detection. Been jailbreaking since iOS 6 and they never had it in any other game. Plus it‚Äôs pretty easy to bypass if they did. 
---
I understand where you are coming from! Which is why I'm trying to make this ability able to be useful, but not LEON powerful. What if you are unable to attack 3 seconds after you go through a wall? Would that allow it, in your opinion to not be another assassin type brawler?
---
Even the most OP brawlers are afraid of Pam! Pam is a MONSTER right now
---
If you‚Äôre not already a clash youtuber, you missed your chance. Lex kairos and coach cory are the youtubers supercell reached out to and that‚Äôs how it is. Same thing happened with clash royale. The ones with the dev build were either big clash/boom beach youtubers or VERY professional (OJ). Now, no offence to you but lex, kairos and coach Cory were chosen by us the viewers and supercell for a reason, and that‚Äôs because their content is a notch above the other youtubers. Your content (from the video you linked) seems nice but not on par with the bigger guys. The dev build is reserved for a select few, that‚Äôs the way it‚Äôs always been, and it won‚Äôt change. I‚Äôm not saying you should stop making videos, but if that‚Äôs the sole reason you make videos for, and even feel ENTITLED to receiving the dev build, then you‚Äôre doing it wrong. Sorry. 
---
Carefully, he‚Äôs a hero.

---
How would it ruin them? It would just make it more accurate 
---
It costs more around 30$ or even higher for a legendary 
---
Imo its would be good that it would start when new season starts and end when season ends and would be worth of 15 normal boxes (or would that be too good?)
---
Club fights!
---
I would love and option....Longer waiting time Is not a problem but seriusly, i am playling only showdown with Bo...
---
Yeah, I already work on this!
---
I think she's fine as of right now, if she was to get a buff it would be insane.
---
She is more like a kid not a middleaged woman
---
Great üëç 
---
How do you do what? He was explaining that supercell could activate replays when they want but are waiting on a big update to do so.
---
pretty good 
---
It's a stupid idea. 
---
It will kill the purpose of leveling up your brawler. Players will just start to pushing their trophies with a brawler lvl 1... Why do you even need to make it stronger, if in your idea you will only fight people approximately your power anyway? 
---
Absolutely not 
---
If I got blown up by peppers I wouldn‚Äôt be mad
---
Isn't tencent?
---
Definitely. The new UI is so impractical. Creating a team and chatting with them is annoying right now.
---
Exactly. How would he know that they have replays ready already and are testing them?
---
Stickman, the new brawler in the game! Hes bombs stick on the objectives, walls and Brawlers, he can detonate them.
---
Health: 4400
---
Auto Attack: 900
---
Super: 900-1080
---
Speed: 770 (Medium?)
---
Reload time: 1.6 seconds.
---
He throws bombs and once they hit a objective they stickon them till you detonate, thrower 4th new bomb or after 3 seconds detonate alone. 
---
His Super allows him to throw one additional bomb and to stick for 5 seconds on the objective for 10 seconds up to 3 bombs. 
---
What do you think about the concept for a brawler that throws sticky bombs?
---
When the game first launched and no one could counter el primo in showdown.
---
Then why ask Leons to not join your game. Contradicting yourself bruh. 
---
Got this 5 days in a row once, maxed out with no leggies
---
I saw gameplay, and I found amazing how he could be facing a Tara, or even a Bull at close range and with 800 HP left, and he could score a goal anyways. Today they would just autoaim and that would never happen
---
Miss those old days ):
---
Just team up with friends. Supercell is to lazy to improve matchmaking. They had this game since 1.5 years and I still get matched with 500 trophy players as an 7k trophy player.
---
What did you spected from Skull Creek? Jessies? Nitas? No pal, that's Bull's land
---
Thanks, its just a concept 
---
Who would win
---
The most rare and legendary brawler in the game or one default BOI
---
For the games that I join with a Leon. Pretty rare. Also it took me 2 eons to realize that your the same person on my previous post. Man this sub reddit hates me
---
o shiet boi thats rough for mortis

ITS BAD ARTWORK/IDEA

Haha yeah he was I do think El Primo and Bull are better for it, though

The ball should despawn if no-one touches it after ten seconds or so and return to the middle with a notification and short countdown.
---
Dude I love you. But you just said you have never seen him in battle. Lets play together tho
---
North corea
---
I remember when most brawlers had like 500-800 health
---
I really like the idea, however I think that robo rumble over 5 minutes and boss fight under 2 minutes are too hard to achieve compared to just winning one 3v3 or getting top 4 in showdown
---
Ah cheers pal
---
How are they related?
---
I love Nita and i hate Leon lol
---
Pfffff does it naff mate, most people don't even look at the comments
---
I swear the wizard skin does more damage.
---
Skin color and both are in animal costumes
---
I was walking home but I'd be more than happy to review your video, also I think that you should indicate that he guide is in he description at the beginning of the video
---
U just sent it a picture from another phone smh. It doesn‚Äôt run on flip phones whatsoever I‚Äôm surprised you tricked so many dumb kids
---
Why do people even think this is a new brawler when the picture is clearly in portrait mode?
---
How about no 
---
Wow! This is an amazing guide, thanks! I will push her now to 900 trophies!
---
Basically, A Girl Leo
---
Getting richochet requires a incredible amount of  luck, skill, and dedication. That is an achievement we should all celebrate 
---
/s
---
Any idea how they did it
---
One shotting brawlers is something supercell doesn‚Äôt necessarily want. That‚Äôs part of the reason why they prevented her from one shotting ricochet. Leon is viable and very strong on every game mode, you see him everywhere, I needs a nerf and that‚Äôs nothing to argue about, imo. As for tara, I may have gone overboard with her but she‚Äôs been a top 5 brawler for months now.
---
Bo also has an Eagle costume.
---
they don't have the technology yet
---
*the lore goes deeper*
---
Can we get a uh __nerf to his rarity__
---
I've been saying this for a year. Glad people are finally seeing the shit storm of posts this sub has.
---
Landscape is better. Change my mind.
---
And why does the skin color matters? It's like i said that every white person is related lol
---
Why is speed in the hundreds rather than just tile per second?
---
yeah they needed to keep the noobs happy so they had to go landscape and autoaim 
---
Saw one posting it with an u/...blablabla.. but it wasn't his so you are good
---
It‚Äôs a picture...
---
I know that. the reason for the tigher spread is so, if you miss your roll really slightly, you aren't severely punished, but if you completely miss, you're still f\*cked. 
---
As for the roll. It can only help getting that assassanation!!!
---
Strange, but that percentage is high
---
Unsub
---
I‚Äôm talking about Piper not the picture. Piper doesn‚Äôt open her eyes during a match.
---
I can‚Äôt tell if it is a PICTURE
---
Wow this is extremely helpful I can't believe I haven't realized these with this new found knowledge I will push to 200 trophy's
---
Have you ever even played against a Piper??
---
Post a vid of u playing with it
---
Yes, I have her, I also have been playing longer than you
---
For a second i thought that there was a dude at 600 trophies that unlocked all the legendaries...
---
Yes I agree they are definitely not giving this guide enough credit
---
^, its not hard to deal with small teams, especially since darryl can get close to them without being outranged when they check bushes
---
Lol this post is stupid
---
Why would they get banned for being in someone‚Äôs game?
---
Then you should know this already. And how do you know that you‚Äôve been playing longer, just curious. Because if you‚Äôve been playing since the launch or beta it makes it even more embarrassing on your part because you don‚Äôt know that Piper has her eyes closed.
---
Drop u fan kit in my private sec.
---
I‚Äôve played day 1 softlaunch...
---
Which allowed you to get 20 gems
---
True dat
---
what
---
And you really didn‚Äôt know about Piper lmao
---
you are awesome tho. I am also a penny main
---
Yes, by killing them 
---
Damage
---
Yeah u wrecked me
---
altho how do you get the bold?
---
Just wait until you learn how to dribble, and you will know the reason why mortis is in 100% of all brawl ball games at 200+ trophies
---
And they also get on Primo's toes
---
Wait, a few seconds before my phone fell out I got kicked out of the gem grab match and I got again stuck in the showdown 10/10 loading screen for a second 
---
Again, I can‚Äôt see if she blinks if it is a picture. Also I don‚Äôt look at her eyes when I‚Äôm playing.
---
?
---
Health buff
---
Fix for those who can't launch is here [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtiGXV\_PnW4&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtiGXV_PnW4&amp;feature=youtu.be)
---
This tyoe
---
I was on a 30 win streaks with a friend for like an hour lmao
---
I know. Crow‚Äôs poison already delays regen time and I think it‚Äôs good enough that he doesn‚Äôt need another damage buff. His health is so low and that also makes him constantly die because he never gets his super charge to escape.
---
Must.not.remodel.darryl
---
Whatever this is pointless. It‚Äôs just one of those things you notice. I don‚Äôt even have her as a character and I noticed but you can argue all u want lmao
---
Hope this gets more attention! No one cared when i posted this :(
---
\**Asterisks like so\** makes this phrase: *Asterisks like so**
---
I put a backslash in for the first set.
---
Then how‚Äôd you get this screenshot... are you taking someone else‚Äôs thing and not giving them credit?
---
No bounty is far superior than Bball
---
look at my username lol..
---
10 iq 
---
Me2
---
Fake sub
---
&gt; how are players going to feel when they just get banned for playing badly? That takes time. 
---
You aren't "playing badly" if you dont move from spawn except move sideways. You're literally throwing a game. 
---
Any decent game has a function to report this and fix it.
---
Me when i play Frank
---
Then change his super to do like a mega poison...instead of jump into danger
---
OML LMAO THIS IS HILARIOUS 
---
I Thought i was the only one   
---
Happened to me 7 times today
---
Hey if I say F to continue the chain will it count?(will delete after answer
---
Nice
---
Yup
---
I totally understand your point of view, I still believe however it happens less frequently than people make it out to be. 
---
I‚Äôm not absolute in my opinion because I‚Äôm only at 2.2k total trophies but in my experience I‚Äôve only seen someone try to team &lt; 5 times. So do you believe it is as big of a problem as it appears?  
---
Haha
---
Awful idea period. I want modes that encourage people to move and kill like the last one 
---
WOW!!!! WE DONT KNOW ABOUT IT!!!!
---
Lol
---
It looks really good except for the spawns which look a bit unbalanced. But the map itself looks really good!
---
The knight is every Frank player
---
It looks stunning
---
Your post has been removed, make sure to use the body of a post to elaborate on the title.
---
Dumbass, there no such thing as critical. And this is confirmed by supercell. What happened on your part is that you game didn‚Äôt register one of the bullets probably due to lag and just adds that to the next bullet. Have you ever seen piper or brock do extra damage? No!
---
Tencent own supercell :D
---
they are very rare all i need now is crow because i got lucky with leon
---
Dude I‚Äôm not pissed I‚Äôm just saying before u post it check if someone‚Äôs already posted it.
---
Leon is 820
---
What is CQC
---
Wow. I want to see what happens next! 
---
you made my pepe hard and white sticky liquid came out is that okay?
---
There are not even joysticks it just holds the phone right? If so it's totally useless.
---
!thesaurizethis
---
Yes.
---
... dong? Raise your dongers?
---
100% Super
---
It takes a eternity to build up super, it should be faster
---
This looks like some jojo shit
---
It's insane how fast she gets her super. Maybe that's why she's my highest rank brawler lmao. I just use her on gem grab tho. With a team because randoms is like hey let's have a 10 loss streak 
---
Haha true 
---
SCHMETTERLING* 
---
really well made
---
I just played some solo, like 10 games and in every one of them there were a team of 4-6 people. So it happens often
---
 üîç      how to upvote a comment twice
---
That's pam
---
Y‚Äôall are new to the ‚Äúculture‚Äù then, or just have bad taste 
---
Idk then but sometimes my brawlers are atacking double maybe am hacker B)
---
Please explain that to all of my random partners 
---
subtle leon flex
---
Wow 
---
But don‚Äôt forget to upvote!
---
I may not agree with you at all, but i do accept constructive criticism so thanks for your input!
---
What do you care? And yeah you were pissedüëåüèº
---
At least the map rotation bonus is nice.
---
Lol Deff my fav Brawler
---
Yeah nobody really cares...
---
Petition for the voice of coco to voice poco
---
You shouldnt be able to go below the rank below your brawler (example:a rank 10 cannot enter the trophy zone of rank 8$
---
All my friends got it in a month
---
Great map! I fully support it.
---
He didn‚Äôt say he thought you were
---
Beta
---
You got to peek fire a lot and use you ability at the best times
---
Buff poison
---
üëÄ hehe
---
You also have to learn where each of her cards go
---
Damn dis kid lookin like a minecraft character (joke, not dissing on you)
---
You mean of this anime?  JoJo no Kimyo na Boken?
---
No isn't like jojo shit, not even watched this in my entire life, at least isn't reference to me
---
Removed - Your post is too short, please expand on your title.
---
What you have to understand is that this game is marketed towards kids... you can see the same effect on the fortnite sub, which indicates to me that 10 year olds don't really make great conversation on reddit.
---
I‚Äôm good with him I‚Äôve got him top 200 back in the old days and I don‚Äôt play him because of how bad he is. It‚Äôs a brawler they could do a total remake of. 
---
Poke the enemies to charge your super and when they group up, super them and all of them would probably die.
---
Sorry, I forgot to mention something.
---
The daily free item in the shop should be removed and replaced with this.
---
However this is a idea! It can be scrapped, tweaked, reworked, etc.!
---
I don't feel like Supercell should just give out free Mega Boxes everyday, this game is very F2P compared to other Supercell games.
---
Any feedback I get is appreciated very much.
---
Sorry for not making this commit earlier! 
---
This is exactly what I was thinking.
---
Sorry dude life isn‚Äôt fair. The legendary brawlers aren‚Äôt even that OP. The only one I‚Äôd say is ridiculously OP is leon but pretty much only in showdown. In other game modes you can use multiple players to take care of him. Spike is really good but manageable. Also you‚Äôre complaint is that they are really good and really rare, that‚Äôs really contradictory bc of course the best brawlers will be the hardest to get I mean what do you expect. If you don‚Äôt like the game you don‚Äôt have to play it. 
---
I love your art style!!
---
150 gems is so expensive :(
---
He could've been playing before the December update. Back then there was a conversion of tokens or some other currency to gems.
---
True. True.
---
if you mean OG, then no lol
---
but I didnt like the tap to aim feature when I first got the game
---
I‚Äôm not gonna 1v1 you over a conversation about why people leave the game instead of pressing play again, in a game that doesn‚Äôt even have a proper 1v1 game mode. What is this, Fortnite? Call of Duty? Get over yourself.
---
Ahem it‚Äôs a canary.
---
We need this
---
I forgot to mention that the daily gift item should be removed for this system.
---
I think it's a fair compensation, but this is a Idea so feel free to give feedback on it.
