"get gud" really? You act like idk how to play the game, when I certainly do and have enough fundamental knowledge to propose a solution (which you ignored). Sorry, not gems but power cubes.   This is only in regards to solo showdown.  Also some of those situations I understand, like 3 people are left.  But I'm talking beginning of the match, all 10 players are alive.  When I'm referring to teaming against a stronger brawler I was trying to convey situations like you are a leon with 0 power cubes, but 2 Shelly's (with 4 cubes each) chase you around ignoring everyone else.  Or when the match begins and see where everyone is spawning in and 3-4 people go straight for you, completely ignoring crates and other players.  I've seen people team together from start to finish of a match, that's also bs.  I'm not referring to the trapping yourself between the storm and other players.  I'm talking about  direct targeting from start to finish.   You saw the video of all those Mike's (like 5-6 of them) teaming in a video posted here, you don't think anything is wrong with that?  Also ??? Doesn't do shit to combat teaming.

---
Personally, I speak with over 520 showdown victories, with only 8107 trophies. I only play showdown. I suggest practicing stuff like kiting, baiting, and dare I say, "team and betray". As dirty as it is I pick up quite a few wins by pretending to be a teamer, and backstabbing when the time is right. 
---
Have patiënce my friend and wait for new brawlers! 
---
Don't mess with me
---
And Shelly
---
I thimk thats the point
---
There's a bull in that bush...

Bull gets a bush around him

Haha overreaction much

Lol, i know NV
---
Mm takes very long at high trophies and it's not vey accurate, do u actually expect mm to be accurate when there's 100 persons? 
---
Nice
---
I like his Name. 
---
Wow that's amazing
---
I would not say stole at all, he has an image where is is a stand off, but with spike and bull instead, and it’s in gem grab. While this could have been inspired by his, it is in no way his idea at all.
---
Nice, could you send some links? I found the official BS discord tho but I don't know how to find more servers
---
I started doing the same when I was at 1000 trophies, in less than a week I'm hitting 4k 
---
I checked, everything is on. It happened without me changing anything
---
I have posted this on Kairos' discord with lots of positive feedback, so here goes:
---

---
&amp;#x200B;
---
**Felix**
---
**Bio:** Felix is from the same tribe as Nita and was the runt if the litter. So, Felix harnesses the elements to conquer his opponents!
---
**Rarity:** Rare
---
**Speed:** 720 (average)
---
**Health:** 3400 (max 4760)
---
**Attack:** Burning Whack 
---
Felix uses his flaming wooden stick to burn others! (Felix hits his opponents with a burning stick that leaves them on fire (similar to Crow’s poison).)
---
Damage: 320 (max 448)
---
Burn Damage: 240/s (2 s) (max 336/s)
---
Reload: 1.0 s
---
Range: 2.5 tiles (75^(o) cone)
---
**Super:** Juggernaut Rage 
---
Felix builds himself a robotic suit with his fire sticks that shields attacks and makes him faster! And it’s made of all-natural ingredients! (Felix enters a suit that is made out of his sticks which makes him slightly faster, blocks 75% of attack damage and sets grass on fire (which can spread) when he walks on it. But, because the suit is made out of sticks that are on fire, it will only last for 5 seconds.) 
---
Speed: 770 (tank) 
---
Time: 5 s 
---
Burn Damage: 480/s (2 s) (max 672/s)
---
**Star Power:** Mineral Meditation 
---
Felix finally harnesses the power of the water element, and uses it by walking on water! (The star power allows Felix to walk on water puddles.)
---
Awesome! Thanks for the advice guys! 
---
I feel like pam is an old woman

He doesnt need a big nerf. He gets destroyed by brawlers easily like bull and if you play strategically you can destroy him. Just reduce his range thats all

I see that. What I’m saying is if he didn’t know it was a repost, and somebody told him, he should’ve deleted it. 
---
Apparently people disagree, but these are the same people who won’t stop posting matchmaking pictures every day, so I’m glad I’m not in line with their opinions.

Barley but I don't have cactus green yet (spike) I enjoy playing throwers a lot. 
---
okl buddy libtarfd
---
Agree
---
Yeah, Leon won by a landslide LOL
---
Maybe for a gane modifiers 
---
Every game, theres different climates but there won't be multiple climates per game
---
1. Raining: similar to life leech, getting wet reduces your hp every 2 seconds 
---
2. Snowing: slows u down
---
3. Etc 
---

No they said it was fine, but could make it difficult to find your account if ever brought up. Look at help and support, "name change " for details

She is also a minor regardless

Yes

It's just an idea!

Supercell should distribute or Extend it...

Not bad!

Health packs!

During matches find health packs and those help you to recover your health after you reach 0 Health back to 100%

Boi..

Looks like ET in a Leon costume

So when would be the wedding if they accept?

My internet is good! Maybe it is her, but these problems happen with several friends.
---
I mean, he fires one needle. With a slower reload rate and lower damage, he’s pretty tame. I imagine it’d be similar to a piper shot in size (not speed persay)
---
crow fires a massive fan, spike does dot and a slow, and poco’s damage is a massive cone and pretty decent damage.

This actually sounds like a cool and fun concept
---
1. Get his star power
---
2. Play with him in Feast or Famine, Cavern Churn and Island Invasion
---
3. Success
---
Jk, his arrows are a little weird. He shoots from left to right, so when you shoot try to move to the left, so you actually hit 3 of the arrows
---
Thank You!!
---
And Bo.
---
Nice job for your first attempt! Keep at it!

Everybody's saying this is OP or not based on their gut feeling, so let's use **_MATH_**!  
---
1 mega box = 1000 tokens  
---
1 big box = 300 tokens  
---
1 box = 100 tokens  
---
1 token doubler = 1 token?  
---
100 players enter, and a total of 4200 tokens worth of rewards are distributed,  2600 from boxen and 1600 from doublers, which averages out to 42 tokens per player.  I can't find stats, but I think this is better than every mode except high difficulty boss fights.  However, if we treat token doublers as worse than straight tokens, this evens out a lot more.

I think it would clutter the screen big time

Okay, thank you for trying to help me.
---
I meant the mechanics, i think he does a little too much, even if he was a legendary. He might not deal damage but he overcompensates in so many other ways man, maybe the slow effect on the super should be his Star Power, or remove that slow effect completely. 
---
I'm not hating on it, i'm just trying to make this idea more ballanced ;)
---
I guess they miss huh?

It's good, you should colour it.

Why does she have big tits /s

never seen it posted before, sorry I don’t spend every waking moment looking at reddit posts

That’s a good point. I don’t see myself doing much solo showdown with him but instead bringing him with me to Bounty with my club

looks like this is not working

THANK YOU for actually helping me and my 7 IQ points
---
Super needs a buff
---
No. That was calculated.
---
Something about this frightens me...
---
Thanks for the info. 
---
Wait how did you do it?
---
It does that when you look at your profile, organized by highest trophy
---
He super needs a buff/indicator like this one. His damage needs a very small nerf.
---
If it's rarity, then crow would contradict, since the game was just released and he's not too strong atm.
---
Lol when Darryl was good before global i got into a heist match. We were all six darryl. Pretty epic 
---
Damage falloff you mean?
---
The old profile system of high to low trophy brawlers is still accessible if you click on the leaderboard section and then click on your own name at the bottom. But I agree that it should be easier than that to access.
---
About 1500
---
It waivers hahahah
---
This reasoning though
---
I kicked a Leon’s ass earlier. He’s weak!
---
I can’t wait for the day where there are so much brawl stars doujins, we start to share our favorites through some sacred numbers.

Speaking of sacred numbers, here’s one to start off with: 177013.
---
At release of the brawler is what I mean, and also there are exceptions although crow was good upon his release
---
I feel like this would get a lot more upvotes if so many people didn't see this as a buff. Honestly, as a player who plays with and against Leon, the last thing he needs is a buff. But I think this rework is necessary and a good idea.
---
I think the fact that you can't see the range of his invisibility kind of adds randomness into the game that it doesn't need. No one can claim they can always tell how far his invisibility goes in relation to other players in the heat of battle while  players are moving even if there was a clear grid system like COC or CR to count tiles.
---
How about a compromise? Obviously he needs a nerf first off but also remove the eye icon when someone enters his invisibility sight range warning you when you are spotted so you have to actually pay attention where players are at and not just be notified when you get to close. At the same time, adding the feature of seeing his range of visibility by enemies would make it less of a guessing game and make him more surgical when avoiding being seen.
---
Good point. Although, I still think complaining about brawl progression isn't really worth it.
---
It's his damage that's overpowered . Have you been paying attention?
---

I got cancer trying to read this
---
Shout out Cummagazine!
---
the most powerful of the world is fast
---
If you're only counting brawlers after global release, then you don't have enough data to draw such conclusions. This whole leon fiasco could just be one big outlier. 
---
ok so I had like 9 saved up and I get no brawler? 😭😤
---
I personally like playing him in gem grab, just toss some mines on the gem mine and you're good to go
---
FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
---
FFFFFF
---
FFFFFFFFFFFF
---
So? I think spike was bad upon release.
---
Yeah, I only started a month ago and I already have every brawler except Frank and the legendaries. I can't complain even if I want to lol. 
---
PS: I just noticed that I replied to you twice on different topics 
---
This is the reason why Daryl is one of my favorite characters
---
It's a bird knew it all along
---
And then u played 10 matches with spike?
---
&gt;there are exceptions
---
You aren’t wrong!  I have 82 gems sitting around and that pink skin is looking very tempting. 
---
Well I'd say at least you need to unlock all Brawlers at league reward, rare, and super rare before having a good chance of getting a legend. The only brawler exception is Bo but idk, it usually depends on your luck. Like for me, I didn't get any mythic, epics, or legends until 4-4.1k trophies.
---
Opened browser 
---
Pff that's nothing. Today today I opened a mega box and got ten Darryl strength points 😎
---
I see. But 2/3 isn't much of a trend.
---
Teach me your ways master. 
---
Weird flex but okay 
---
We aren't only talking about legendaries, consider lower rarities being bad as well.
---
And bull’s face
---
Cuando empiezan a hablar español pero lo lees con acento en inglés....
---
Lmao that’s the best “redrawing” I’ve ever seen
---
They need a remodel. lol
---
El primo swiping those boxes that me, a low damage player took forever to get low health, is just painful.
---
Might as well just create another account now, this is the peak of brawl stars potential 
---
Sorry if the drawing's a bit sloppy I'm too lazy to neaten it haha.
---
Oh shit
---
Put Shelly x Jessie(Lenny face)

DON'T MIND ME HERE
---
R.I.P NITA HAHA=/
---
Its random
---
Unsatisfied? I posted a new and improved version of this.. Go check it out!
---
But that just show it off, i want to have that where you select the brawler so i can choose better which one is behind and need to be pushed
---
Thank you
---
Oh
---
  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) 
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
you are have ONE XD
---
My man!
---
Ok.. 
---
Lol
---
It's so beautiful bro. Good luck :)
---
I feel like Tara is Shelly 
---
I also have been thinking about how they could do this. I think a good BR type mode would be to make it a weekend only Showdown type of thing, where everyone is locked to 1 character, or type of character (ie Tank, DPS, Sup, etc..) and the map is a random one of all available Showdown maps each time. The reason is to keep the battlefield as equal as possible. Poison cloud ON. Energy drink and power boxes can spawn in random locations that are not spawn designated or out of reach (obviously). As for prizes, I think a Mega Box might be a bit much but it could be: 1st-5th would get Mega Tokens according to place (ie 1st-5...5th-1). I like the rest of your prizes though the token amounts might could be tweaked some (that's on SC). I don't know that 100 people would be the easiest for some peoples phones to handle but 30-40 I think is certainly doable.

Yay

hes not even bad
---
Favorite so far!
---
Yours is better than mine lol
---
I think good Leon players are well aware of the range and they are already keeping track of it well. While this would make him easier to play, I think beginner Leon’s would see the most benefit. If anything it lowers his skill ceiling, which could be interpreted as a buff. 
---
I agree with op, I scrolled through the memes that were deleted and a good bunch of then were “low effort”?!?!? those are normal effort memes, wtf are u on mod...
---
[here you go my friend ](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ) 
---
theyve already addressed this, they wont add a 100 player showdown, at least not any time soon
---
and for dinner 
---

---
I think you should increase the rewards for winning, because winning this game is very difficult.
---
I sense a gamer girl
---
I sure hope so! 
---
You should put some sense into it. Theres no one who can unlock 3 brawlers in one day (f2p) and get them to 500 in an hour . I just said that i got them to 500 in an hour doesn't mean that I got them from 0 to 500. If people are sensible and actually use their brain , they won't assume that I got them 0 to 500. It's people like you who spread toxicity on reddit. Literally no one is saying congrats and something positive, all are just spreading jealousy and negativity on my post. Just look at the previous comments on my post, look at their mindset and toxicity. I've had it with this BS reddit community. If you don't like my post, just downvote it , don't write negative comments. First week on reddit and I'm already dealing with this , have some shame and treat new users properly please I beg you.
---
You think it’s op because you’re fighting high lvl Leon’s and don’t know how to counter them. They aren’t that good like everyone thinks. 
---
if they added this it would probably come with a damage nerf
---
Please boy. Its not impossible 😂😂😂
---
Make an overpowered character even more powerful. Would a great idea...
---
Maybe just give power cubes by killing other brawlers?!
---
Rip stormy plains
---
HES INVISIBLE AHAHHHA I GET IT ABAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAH OMG OMG OMG OMG HAHAHHAHAHAHAH 10000000/10 HAHAHAHAPMG LITERALLY DEAD AHAHA 💀💀💀😂😂💀😂😂💀😂😂💀
---
Hell no. The biggest problem in showdown is his massive health pool. He snowballs so frequently because he can easily take boxes from almost any brawler early. There are very few people who can pump out enough damage to deter a bull from simply walking in, taking a box, and walking out, due to his massive health pool. If you contest, you die, if you don't, he takes your box. He needs lower health in showdown. His damage doesn't really matter, he's just unkillable most of the time. 
---
Lol he’s not a hacker before the trophy road existed he could get unlocked from chests

they are both pretty bad not gunna lie :0

Yeah I set goals to get all my brokers to a certain trophy count and then proceed from there. I just got them all to 200, working towards 300 each now. Becomes a game within the game if you care enough.
---
Holy shit
---
This is old news pal, the three new brawlers and the Chef dynamike skin were datamined ages ago(along with the christmas skins, boss hunt and boom box brock but they’ve been released since then).

Matchmaking’s a way bigger demon. Today’s the first day I havent played for the 80 trillionth day in a row because the algorithm regurgitates the same mierda: scale win rate as close to 50% as possible (to get people to buy leon I guess), cater to p2w’s (people that think they’ll win once they pay, anyway), and “balance” skilled, low-power brawlers against ones with power level 8+ when you’re trying to push a brawler that hasn’t even cracked 100 trophies. Kinda beyond sick of this, and may not even come back once balancing finally happens since this is hardly the first time anyones seen such a trudy algorithm
---
I just feel like there's already 1000 battle royale games you can play
---
Alr how we going to do this nvm I’ll just type my code

There was nothing wrong with it, I love the concept, if supercell is able to make it smooth for 60 or 100 players it’ll be awesome, if not then they can do what I said

I don’t really like the multiple box system. I think it’s a little complicated for a game like brawl stars, which is supposed to be really simple. Additionally the area where each of the box numbers is displayed takes up a lot of space on the screen. Maybe narrow it down to 3 different boxes?
---
Boomer: Throws a boomerang. Simple.
---
Super: Sets off a sonic boom, stunning all enemy brawlers within a 15 block radius. (Super does 0 damage)
---
So cool! It’s really spooky lol 
---
They would’ve changed their name recently, just takes a while to update
---
I'll play tomorrow,its 2:15 a.m. where I am lol. I'll think about joining your clan

Hi, posted your guide at here: [https://brawlstarsup.com/team-compositions/](https://brawlstarsup.com/team-compositions/)
---
Added some graphics for it so people can read it easier.
---
I also mentioned your name a few times as the author of the guide.
---
Thank you so much. Hopefully you like it!
---
Let me know If you want to change anything!
---
I actually just got my Darryl to 500. He is good in places he wasn't good before.  To me,  he is a poor mans Leon. However,  a slight damage buff will help and also probably not pushing him till you get his star power will help too 
---
K same 2:16 good night  just hit me up if you want the clan info
---
It depends. Some brawlers are able to only hot the front player. But others such as El Primo, Shelly’s super, Barley, Dinamike... and many others can easily destroy a compact group. Plus, don’t always depend on your teammates, whether you are playing with randoms or not. It is true in team modes you gotta cooperate, but you can’t be a *swag playah* if you don’t know how to work on your own ;)
---
Probably becouse its bad lmao, y u ask.

---
Yikes, stell dein Handy auf Englisch, das ja eklig
---
Amazing!!!
---
I guess, but he has that eye notification already... If you need this radar, I can imagine the type of player that would need this. The run around and aimlessly spam one just to wait for his super. 
---
When if he gets a nerf, which the Canadian version is being looked into, he still doesn't really need this. It's kind of unnecessary unless you really don't pay attention. 
---
Oh right my bad I didn't even notice who you replied to my bad 
---
That doesn't even make sense. Get your templates right
---
better when you have both
---
No it doesn't! Oh wait.. it's too late now

It was already in gamefiles. Lmao
---
I've had that almost every day since I started playing  12 days ago. Am at 4.5 k trophy's now
---
I agree on you with that; I hate fortnite. But this seems like it could be a very fun event, especially with the special boxes the poster suggested.
---
ahh i see..thnx for the info hoping this problem gets fixed soon...

Well no one of them release a cancer game that spreads faster than ligma and one of them released a decent game. What is there to confuse

Amazing
---
Same thing happened with me yesterday.
---
There were definitely legy offers in shop before global, but I guess only if you were missing legendaries. I've had Leon on shop literally the day after he was released (I had all brawlers besides him).
---
I hear 5 men yelling "El Primo"
---
The gems are worth a lot less than the other drops.
---
Also the token doublers are waay too much. Thats like 10 to 15 boxes. Or at least 1 mega box. Not worth 10 to 20 gems.
---
I think the only thing preventing this is the servers, but it would be great if they could pull it off.
---
About the 3 throwers max per round - I've definitely had 4 (3 Dynamikes 1 Barley). Interesting to see the meta discussion here though, might have to bust out some underused brawlers of mine

Wow. Brock breaking the 4th wall...

At the end,I was with 7 power cubes and the opponent was a poor 2power cubes RICOCHET 😂😂

and the game still lags either you have good internet or not

but they both are crow so you are wrong.

1 Leon is all u need I had a similar situation before except 1 was a barley

Not bad idea but 60 players is too many

---
Red hot for opponents but ugly blue for u
---
It messes up mortis’ in the action as well. A quick auto aim and your as good as dead
---
Why is the chilli purple and the thrown explosive unchanged?
---
Nah it's too expensive bb. Plus they keep making skins for character we already have, on top of the game devs making stupid amounts of money of brawlstars existing. No excuse.
---
It can happen at the same time
---
Bruh auto aim is only for new players.  Nobody uses it at higher trophies. Not even bulls. 
---
The only places you would use auto aim are :
---
- Robots (robo boss , robo rumble , boss fight)
---
- against the boss in big game
---
He is going to get a visual update, maybe they'll release a skin at the same time!
---
Exactly
---
Do you need to have mike unlock to get the skin or you can do like barley and unlock him by getting his skin ?
---
Ok😐
---
Replays?
---
It’s my iPad and Apple Pencil.    I’ve been messing around with different art styles.  Here’s my last one of Miles Morales https://i.imgur.com/M2BI9m0.jpg

---
Not with them playing bull and ambushing, I can't even get my barley past 460
---
Unless he throws the whole pot when he ults and food and confetti sprawls in colorful ways, this is overpriced af.
---
Not even ur post
---
the spread of the knives makes the longrange damage too weak
---
Okay, your opinion.
---
I mean if you're using mortis you don't really have a choice 
---
if u look on my last few post l, I've been getting toxic comments so because of that I was fed up and angrily replied.
---
"Hey ya back yet?"
---
As all things should be.
---
If you don't have any other brawler at power 9, then yes, because you'd unlock the 1%/box star-power option. Otherwise, it's as you like…

You need to unlock him in the trophy road. He's the 2.000 trophies reward.
---
Wizard Barley unlocking him is an special case, although an skin offer might include the brawler too (like if you didn't have Penny, you could buy her alongside the Lil' Helper Penny skin, in a more expensive pack. But I don't think these pack will include Trophy Road brawlers.)
---
Amazing, great job! But is kind of creepy.
---
He throws chillies now... that’s an animation change?!?
---

---
Your attacks are always blue.. enemy sees red.. same for Leon 
---
No please. You make your allies fight 2v3 while you just dash in dash out to collect the gem. And then you'll become a pinata
---
If I am not wrong, someone leaked this a week or two ago, or are you talking about another post?
---
Double trouble 2.0

In the end, is he called "Chef Mike" or "Spicy Mike"?.

New Star Power: Crows Poison stack up to 5 times adding + x0.5 basic poison damage per Attack. (Multible Dagger hits dont apply more Stacks) this would make him far better than he is now...
---
Allright I'm at 1850 so it's not so bad I'll grind a bit after work. Thanks for the reply! Also I was wondering since the offer dont appear for me yet, how long will the offer stay?

I’m pretty sure someone drew a Dynamike Chef skin, or just made the concept.

Its not a skin idea, it was found it the game files right?

U have to take them out early game but that’s still hard, the game is just kinda cancerous rn bc of Leon AND Bull.

I know but my question is about possibilities. Many youtubers are gaining luck points as the open more boxes... but mine are the same since the beginning of the game

No. Sadly

This skin was leaked awhile back.
---
Dont care. Deserve to be bullied. They are the least trustworthy brawlers and they always team up
---
Looks freaking good 🖒
---
Alright i believe u,tho i think ur post will be taken down cus of "repetitiveness" rule on the subreddit.
---
When was it posted?
---
No it's fine with other brawlers. It's all about positioning and aiming, if you do both well, you can take any other brawler out.
---
As of Leon, there is no strategy involved. I cant focus on taking out 5 Leons in early games. I might take one or 2 out, but I won't have any box and there would be 3 other Leons running around. And trust me, they know they can take me out easily with their super
---
That's asset replacement, an animation change is a change in their movements.

You could do 3 small needles with low dmg/heal per shot

I like the name Pirate but supposedly isn't that general.

None of you got it. He meant the *real price* should be 80 not 150. That's why he said he sees it's 80

Man, i really wanna get turn on, but i just can't lol

why? lol
---
Uhh showdown is not gonna help people progress cuz it's just full of teaming and free carries.. try playing 3v3 and improve.. Wise words from a 16k
---
I’m probably gonna be posting more of these drawings of Brawlers as Smash Bros characters since it’s an idea that I’ve had for a while that I thought would be fun to do.
---
I don't know how to help but I guess you could contact supercell
---
And here i am with a lvl 135 account being made 4 months after beta release, even spent money on the game, and I still only own one legendary(which was openef at lvl 120 btw, after 1 year of having the acc)
---
Lol, why u have level 8, and only 14 rank on him? 
---
Could get a new brawler, or get power points to upgrade your already existing brawlers.
---
There is literally no reason to hold onto em, unless your acc is literally maxed.
---
Even then, they can drop event tickets and gems.

Ok. Update in 15th February. Yep?

yes the game does that often
---
yeah but i'm not worried about that right now, i like the pase that my brawlers are growing at, i'll probably open like one box a day 🤔
---
English pls
---
Okay... sure.
---
seems daft but eh, not my account.
---
oh god oh fuck
---
OMG thx
---
Como puedo descargar los videos de reddit :)

I'm not good at Spanish:) I am not sure how to download videos on Reddit.
---
That would be amazing! I have to eye ball it when I’m invisible and sneaking up on ppl
---
Thx!
---
I say next update which is probably March, if not, supercell will have a small anniversary update in May, and if not again, then there’s gonna be one in September
---
He looks quite.... dashing.
---
&gt;a legendary should be good
---
found the p2w.
---
I would not nerf leon‘s health, just speed (and maybe give him some extra speed in invisible mode so he can actually maneuver fast like he should but not all the time) and of course that damage. I would also remove a pellet or two off his salvo. 
---
Congrats, you used Bull as intended. Now proceed to get wrecked by smart, high-ranked players who already understand how to deal with Bull, or are wise-enough to just also use Bull on certain maps.  Moving on.
---
Of course 
---
10 chests = 1 mega box
---
10 chests = 50 gems
---
1 mega box = 80 gems
---
Something doesn't fell right...but what?
---
What next, sous chef coult?
---
Get used to it and grow up. You wanna post half-assed ideas with zero regard for balancing and then cry like a baby when people tell you it's bad, then you shouldn't even be on reddit. Also, enjoy the downvotes. ;)
---
Do you mind explaining why?
---
99.9% they weren’t teaming but that all of them have their star powers..
---
To much gems 😞😞😫😭🥺
---
FBI OPEN UP!!!
---
Oh let people have their fun.. I never expected my post to gain the attention it did really.. just glad to give people a way to have some fun in our great community. 
---
You're right, let's sue supercell for ripping us off
---
Well, I think BS’s server can’t make it.
---
Looks like you’re really bad lol
---
Good idea! In in
---
The skin was datamined almost one month and a half ago
---
Wholesome comment 
---
Chef Mike is great! When will the next update be?
---

The average reward value should be 25 gems or slightly higher. It doesn’t make sense for them to have the lowest possible reward equal to 25 gems, because that essentially means you get better rewards without any risk. You have to have some prizes be worth less than 25 gems if you want prizes worth more than 25 gems 
---
ita possible to upload more maps in same post?
---
sounds good to me
---
Spike is so cute no matter what 
---
Just did the math we can't sue them for that. But I still want to sue them...
---
Pro tip: The easiest way to ensure your skin idea is never made is to post it.
---
Replays are already in the game. Go to match history and in the top left of every match you will read "replays are not implemented yet" or something like that. They just need to rise a bit to 1 in their servers and this can happen at any time. 
---
As they said somewhere they already have the technology, they just need to test because servers must be ready for the massive amount of the data players will generate :)
---
Neither... save your gems to get token doublers. Buying coins is such a waste and bad deal 
---
We must make another one! I want a voodoo tara ;(
---
Terrible advice, buy token doublers instead with your gems 
---
Looks like he has no power points for sale, which means he likely maxed out all his characters, so it makes sense for him to have a ton of coins 
---
🔥🔥🔥
---
GG
---
Haha glad to see this being enjoyed among you all.
---
You get a lot of mistakes when you're moving or running away.
---
S H A M E
---
if you want new brawlers then yes but do what you want with the gems
---
good luck
---
Thanks!
---
I’ll look a little into it
---
It’s a *solo* showdown. If you want teams then play any of the other 4 game modes
---
But he does need a buff. I like him and think he holds up pretty well if played right, but he could use *either* a touch of damage boost, range boost, **or** his super selfcharge just a little bit faster. 
---
He's a solid brawler, but it feels like he falls short. 
---
shame on them for not making skins for brawlers that need them
---
I’m not sure man. If they wanted to start upping the quality of posts, they’d start removing the empty pictures of “Leon” and the thousand screenshots of bad matchmaking per day. Not sure why they started with you specifically
---
It's ridiculous how your emotions are blinding you from a perfectly logical UI improvement.
---
Proof that people who play Bull are trash
---
Different people. Those who do the skins don't do balance changes
---
Where is monsieur hat
---
The eye only tells you when you have already been seen. The point of the circle is to make sure you don't accidentally walk too close and get noticed when you didn't mean to.
---
Gee thanks
---
Yeah, I’m a little new to dis
---
You mean translucent right? Somewhat see through but not completely 
---
It does almost no damage outside of shotgun range
---
Have both spike and crow yet on two brawlers leon and mortis
---
Oh and push all your brawlers evenly
---
NEW BRAWLER - souper-sale
---
Rarity:Rare
---
Role:control
---
Attack - NERF Gun
---
Souper-sale fires off a series of unbalanced NERF bullet, nerfing his opponents’ health,speed, and damage by 10% for 5 seconds. Hitting his teammate will buff it’s health, speed, and damage by 10% for 5 seconds.
---
Super - Connection Error
---
Souper-sale sabotages server connection. Causing his opponents to lag for 5 seconds.
---
They have to start somewhere.
---
I will be okay with it if they remove every other post then too, but they dont seem to be doing that. 
---
Um, yeah. Sure. Maybe I didn't say it correctly. Thanks for correcting me. 
---
good bot
---
Thank you, realbriank, for voting on EFTBot.
---
Wel in An BB you get 5 pulls. So 5x a chance for an brawler. In an mega you have 50. (if this is what you meant I'm on forehand sorry that I misread your comment)
---
Mortis' win and lose animations are different when he has the Rockabilly skin.
---
If i team i don't let the other teamer get near me :)
---
Are frank, penny and leon crests done by you? If so they look so good
---
I don't have a problem with it. Also, how did this not get removed for too many capital letters in the title.
---
Congrats! 
---
Why the leggies are hanging on her sides tho? Kinda slayer?
---
This
---
People already care too much about killing others instead of PTFO (playing the fucking objective)
---
Nice art
---
I haven’t used him yet, because frank is so good
---
In another skin
---
I haven’t gotten many cards for them
---
This isn't even remotely funny
---
Awesome Mortis! 
---
You Said that yesterday 
---
But txs
---
well i guess i could try
---
Have some positivity, BS is a growing game and devs will do something about him soon
---
I’m at 2000 trophies and I don’t have crap
---
I would love some nerd status too like accuracy and dmg done
---
Nope. It is not Skyrim Map.

Wow, well done! 
---
the 1 tile enty'sto the middle and the ring around it.
---
You didn’t draw that, its digital
---
I’m at 5.2k with only 14 brawlers. Started at global release. Not to mention that I bought 2 of them and would only have 12 brawlers if I never spent money.
---
Some of us are just unlucky...
---
Woah!!! That's nice!!!

Here is OFFICIALLY my entry. i found something like this so i changed it up a bit and here you go!

i spent a lot of time so it will be worth it if this is entered.

thank you!

Six months :/

Boom-Boom!

You sure its not.2 then?

Yeet🔥

Bull’s paradise

Also Mortis would easily kill dynamike because Mortis can say the N-Word

It goes up by .0048 every five days

Ignone both obviously

*niiggggaaaaa*

Nice!!
---
Seeing Frank as King Dedede would be interesting 
---
Yes. Im sure its 0.02
---
I'm thinking maybe giving Power Points like in Clash Royale. You Can Trade 5 Legendary PP, 10 Mythic, 20 Epic, 40 Super Rare, 80 Rare, and 100 Trophy Road, Every 6 Hours. You can only do it if the person you are giving to has requested PP.
---
? What do you mean 
---
Lol I luv dat username
---
Well i got crow when i had about 0.07 :D
---
What about - Mini arena?
---
I dont know how it got that low then
---
Actually would be fun
---
How long ago was that
---
1- The 3D was a very good and necessary idea
---
2- I don\`t really be intrerested in the skins because they are somewhat bland. I really like the idea of the seasonal skins, but  they should make them something more striking and surprising.    
---
And let's say "I want to buy them because I liked them a lot" 
---
3- The global of Brawl Stars was recently, so I think it's not yet time to introduce yourself to the Esports
---
4-  I'd like you to put some chat bubbles (with customizable messages) so that when you put them out, they go out to those who are with you in battle,  but that can be denounced if the message they have is offensive 
---
5-  It would be called Ray, it would be a legendary brawler who will attack melee with a sword, his super will increase his damage and his speed by 150% for 7 seconds, and his star power will make his allies receive a buff of 50% more than damage and speed during the same period of time 
---
Just hang in the back and chuck shit at the mine or brawl ball till you have enough EXP?
---
Lol i played you yesterday
---
About a month ago i think
---
You play often?
---
No. Just a Dinner-Mike
---
Every day.
---
Ocean man
---
Oh, i see. But it's not a bug like he said. And he was very dramatic with that "fix this... please", lol.
---
[deleted]
---
U good bro?
---
That’s a first 
---
Yeah figured, I’m at level 5 right now I’d have to say the 2880 hp is by far the biggest limiting factor
---
Thats weird
---
Not enough obstacles this place will be just pipers and bos
---
What is up with your brain being so small? Notice only 20 trophies, fun fact when you get a new brawler out of a box they start at level one.
---
Exchanged materials
---
Yes I think you are crazy. Supercell wont make such useless button 🤣
---
Thanks for a quiz :/
---
Good names 
---
ok wish you luck 
---
Brawlers’ rarities are based on how unique they are, not how good they are
---
Can you draw her getting fucked in the ass?
---
first i thought this was a madoka reference, lol
---
He’s rather Jesus
---
‘not the hero we wanted, but the hero we needed’
---
bwahaha nice pun and roast
---
To be fair this chef mike skin was leaked before brawlidays
---
This is good
---
They should make him into a beer keg.
---
love their faces
---
GG well played
---
Are you stupid?
---
xD
---
Excuse my ignorance , but what is a remodle?
---
Its over crow, I have the high ground.
---
Do you have a link to a post where they explain what the three new brawlers are?
---
His normal attack range works like Penny normal attack, but when contact, it do an area damage.
---
And his super works like Barley super range but don't do damage over time. 
---
I hope you understand lol
---
my bad didnt notice that.. but still their trophy distribution is way too extreme to be a main account
---
he may be the worst one, but imo hes got the most enjoyable mechanics
---
#I M R E A D Y T O S E R V E
---
wait this is actually amazing why hasn't anyone else thought of this yet? 
---
Bruh, it's still a drawing.
---
It’s more about whether you like the skin and will wear it. Also keep in mind that Spicy Mike will be available forever, so it’s not necessarily a big rush. That said, if you like the skin a lot, then it’s definitely worth it in my opinion.
---
I’ll think about it
---
Thx
---
Its just changing how a brawler looks to make them look better.
---
Congrats!
---
But how?
---
for realism 
---
Remodel then ? Not remodle
---
It's lag. ur lagging.
---
Crow x Leon
---
Clearly you'll get 2 Shelly's
---
Is it gonna barf out pink hair

*When 3 bulls come to you from different directions*
---
Confeiteiro é melhor
---
WTF do u mean if u are playing at 400 trophies or higher it works
---
Lack of health and damage
---
No
---
Just making his attack more consistent would be perfect. At the moment he is a literal glass cannon, he can output a lot of damage if you're essentially holding hands with an enemy but anywhere else is like you're flinging butter at them. 
---
Lmao. U guys have it good. I pulled two within a week from each other and now it’s .0096😭😭😭
---
The title should be *Darryl struggles to beat colt in a 1v1 at point blank range” btw.  
---
Bull is now op 
---
The super should also have a little mini map or a location to tap
---
I’m at 4.4k and no it does not
---
Is this your first time playing a supercells game? Shit never works. 
---
Its cool to know there are assholes in the community like you when someone is just trying to help. Hope u enjoy ur life doing that ;)
---
Are teaming pipers common? I’ve never seen piper in showdown, let alone two of them teaming.
---
Trust me I get that it’s frustrating. And I agree that you should be pulling super rares. But some people just aren’t lucky. I didn’t get my first mythic until June (beta started almost a year earlier). Granted, mythics weren’t a thing to start but it still took my about 8 months to get one and I was at about 8.5k at the time. I didn’t get my first legendary for over a year. I hit 10k and completely maxed out my account completely F2P before I got my first legendary. Statistically, I should’ve had two legends by the time I maxed out my account. Not only that but the first legendary I bought with free gems I didn’t even get it from a box. The point is, I totally get that it’s frustrating. I went through it worse than most people. I have gone over 6 months at a time without a new brawler. But sometimes you just gotta push through and eventually your luck will turn around
---
Sorry for that actually I was trying a new keyboard so I am not used to its layout
---
Nothing on the dev build is ever set in stone. Everything is subject to change (even the day before it goes into game). 
---
Cool idea... Not enough energy boxes tho
---
God like
---
Will add eventually... Thank you
---
What is the actual map?
---
Thanks
---
A perfect map for bull
---
Does anyone know what happens if you already have all the brawlers in one of these categories? Does the offer disappear or change when you reach that point?
---
Great idea, actually
---
¡Increíble!
---
Nope
---
Skills ... I think
---
Rico
---
Thank you so much 
---
No problem :D
---
Not all of them
---
Wondering if this was intentional and if it is, why
---
What about Bo, Poco, Tara, rico, piper, penny...
---
Yeah
---
Congrats! I reached 9 with poco bo nita combo like 2 hours ago. Poco always awesome when in proper hands (like mine) hehe
---
Cus red may signify enemy ones?? Idk
---
i am making him kind a regular robo rumble robot with some design changes. Do you have clothing ideas as barley and Rico?
---
The gas will kilo you
---
Doesn’t make sense to show the one that’s being sold as red if it’s not what you’re going to have
---
I killed like 5 of them, when I killed the first one I had 0 pc but at the end I had like 5
---
Or a lucky one
---
Ty
---
oh god
---
You should kill 1
---
Is that a bull in the bush ?
---
I see you point 
---
Bruh
---
Because he check the bushes
---
:o finally something good
---
weird flex but ok
---
Like mortis can?
---
Damn son, I have 4000 trophies and just 13 characters :( 
---
1000 trophies - 9 unlocked.
---
Lol. Maybe you’ll go with them?  
---
Mortis needs a buff too in all honesty 
---
ok...? 
---
Repost
---
most of the games share similar stuff, it's common sense so there's no need to say it.
---
Nice work bud
---
i have mortis tara and leon on my account where u are at. nothing higher
---
I literally just took this screenshot. Want more proof?
---
So true
---
Smh, why do we have to have toxic assholes like you in the community. The dude was being as polite and nice as possible and then you attack him, wtf dude.
---
:/
---
I'm not sure what he uses but a nice free one is piskel u can make animated ones with it too
---
We need rustling animations.
---
You better bull-lieve it
---
Too bad I can't double upvotes this..
---
The walls on the edge of the map in the middle aren't the same for both sides. Top side has an advantage. 10/1000. Good map after that tho.
---
He is not an English native speaker. This doesn't necessarily mean that he can't spell, it could also be the fact that he can't format word conjunctions and grammar related stuff properly. 
---
Wow. Fantastic work. Do more! 
---
I have him at 460 trophies but i had to play hard with him and not easy as the other brawlers
---
Good job mate! Which game modes were you playing most of the time?
---
Epic are the guys who make Unreal, they know what they're doing
---
Wow.. please do more i beg u 
---
:) 👌❤
---
In the shop, click on a mega or big box and then click on the 'i' and you should be there.
---
Nah that's fine. But I see a lot of these posts, so yeah.
---
Ovvv thx
---
Dunno if its sarcasm lmao
---
I just found it odd, got mortis a bit ago then just got Tara from my big box
---
Really? Mortis is a mythical and one of the worst brawlers
---
Feel good to see that Im not the only one above 4500 without epics or higher 
---
Zoom in.. look at the details! Woah! ❤ Is this my crush now? xD
---
probably could do it.
---
Princess Peach Piper drawn in the style of Adventure Time.
---
I think that rolling assassin is too specific, all the other types apply to other brawlers. That would be like making Bull ‘charging shotgunner’ which would only apply to him. 
---
I do like the idea though. Daryl doesn’t current fit into heavyweight, so he would have to go into another category.
---
Yes i know without getting any it goes up by that amount though
---
Love this! Messy but clean at the same time

Just saying, if you wait for the offer to re-appear, there is a chance that it could gain value (more gems, possible more boxes or coins, idk). But the offers do change and then come back.

Be nice.

Sometimes it doesn’t work at all! I believe that it has something to do with the amount of people playing in your region... Have you tried weird times? Like 1am or somethen?
