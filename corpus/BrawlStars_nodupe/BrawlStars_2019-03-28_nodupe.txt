You're looking to see what you can do better but imho you've already done really great.

Is the star in the picture? I feel like I am missing something
---
100/10 would buy
---
Well,that's mortis
---
Nerf the FUCK out of her super. IMO no super should be stack-able and all should have some sort of cooldown.
---
Gene Gene bizzare adventure
---
My problems with your post. There are more than 2 true tanks. Frank is more of a true tank than primo is, and I‚Äôd even go to say Pam is a tank and possibly even carl. Also, it takes time for them to implement brawlers and make sure they are all balanced. In addition, even buffing the worst brawlers would not eliminate a meta. A meta would still arise no matter what and theres more than just brawlers to make a meta. Maps and gamemodes also define a meta
---
I don‚Äôt team
---
Really cool!!
---
And not even good updates back then...
---
Gedi kor level
---
Nope I totally understand 
---

---
But nwm skin animations are TOP notch
---
Only hating cuz of there first impression (face)
---
poor Colt
---
True. Just continue to play, if you're really in it for the fun pushing trophies shouldn't be your main concern. You'll get the other brawlers eventually.
---
whats the movie name?
---
I've seen a 0.0096
---
I agree but nwm have top notch animations
---
Ppl only hate cuz of their first impression (face)
---
what a fucking abomination 
---
XD
---
Supercell buys fortnite a deletes it
---
Yes the arts nice and all but it could do with more description or demonstrations of sorts
---
They make millions off of esports, but literal billions off of IAPs

Here......a Oscar for you, best plot ever

u/RyanSupercell

u/FrankSupercell

Thanks man
---
Niceeee &lt;3
---
chances are 1 in a 400, happened to me twice in 8 months of playing
---
#finally someone better than gedi kor
---
It should be a double tap character. Period.
---
And spend billions updating and paying their employers. Sorry, did I say millions, I meant hundreds of millions.
---
Before I read the title, I thought this is the new update.... 
---
Your right dog 
---
Wham pam here comes Bam!
---
I have.  I never played it before though.
---
How many trophies do u have
---
That sounds like an achievement to me. You are better than them
---
Wham bam here comes Bam
---
Hehe, well it's natural for me because, I don't really have a consistent art style and sure I will continue making more artworks!
---
Yup
---
R/NitaGang approves excellent work
---
It's a piece of junk that needs buffing
---
Uh, what?
---
I imagine his voice like pekka or mini pekka
---
[removed]
---
What does it have to do with jealousy?
---
I like the idea, but the actual edit is wordy and unnecessary. Ideally an unintended ability to snipe people beyond walls is a more advanced tactic that belongs in a tip section. Keeping things simple is always nice. 
---
Also I appreciate any reference to pokemon but you can totally do better than using the ability name verbatim. 
---
so leon is commiting a kamikaze act or
---
#STOP ABUSING SPIKE
---
just wondering but how did these people get names mortis or leon just wondering 
---
Bad - Face, Chin
---
Good - Animations, Ingame look
---
And for 59 gem, Hell Yeah 
---
That‚Äôs the second animation with Sakura spike by official supercell today. The other one said ‚Äúcoming soon‚Äù. What do you think they‚Äôre gonna add? It might be a new theme/environment. 
---
Spinning doesn‚Äôt wor-
---
(This is my favorite Penny and Darryl fanart)
---
It seems to fit more with him. He‚Äôs all about brute strength and overwhelming force, which fits red pretty well. Green would be more about growth. 
---
Sorry i didnt realisedüòì
---
That hurt me and killed everyone 5 miles away from me
---
I Also see that the bow tie color changes in the icon and in the drawing
---
Yeah I can kinds see that 
---
The crow saying buff crow
---
Supercell fans do better things than Supercell itself. 
---
Pure
---
Underrated reply right there.
---
Noice
---
This would actually be super interesting to play. There are a ton of paths through the map, and I even see a wall that could be destroyed  to create another path. Dyna with star power would also be interesting.
---
The original concept was supposed to be just a wolf, "werewolf" is some sort of nickname.
---
Also original Nita already has some sort of "round" necklace, so we made sure it was different from the 2 already existing skins.
---
We appreciate your comment tho ^^
---
That is so cool !üëå
---
This was my goal, I‚Äôm at 6782 right now

Set your flair in the subreddit. You can find a tutorial on google

Dang, better give up my art dreams because this is epic

u/hathatsthesexnumber

Bro...
---
ha that‚Äôs the sex number 
---
yea he can outrange him.. and hit him with some sweet 400 dmg attacks.. while a poco with an iq above 80 can defend an objective against a crow without any trouble because he has 5320 hp.. crow can tickle him all day without getting anything out of it. 
---
Oh, I will! Thanks!
---
Or crow could literally walk up on poco as he fights against literally any brawler, as crow has a damage, reload speed, and mobility advantage.
---
Soo deep!
---
Shelly is the new sparky.  Complete ass at higher trophies and completely op in lower trophies.  And there's no correct way to balance her without fudging the whole balance of one side.
---
Sbeve
---
Because primo excels at close range, so when you take damage, it is a sign your are getting close enough to shoot them. Frank is weak at close range, as he has low dps compared to the other tank brawlers and his super is easily dodgeable.
---
Yeah but lets do 25
---
I want cro cro so bad...
---
I know you really meant ‚Äúshould‚Äù, so you can keep getting wins like that ü§≠
---
Nice idea. It could be used for escaping as he is vulnerable when he throws his pickaxe.
---
But the most important thing is that............
---
Where is the crow buff?ü§î
---
Yes but only if you had Supercell ID
---
Is this a JoJo reference
---
I use photoshop too guess I just need to get a lot better at it üòÇ
---
Can I get an F for the Shelly that DIDN'T auto-aim her super?
---
Crow needs a minor "buff". An enemies poisoned should have their healing abilities Blocked while poisoned. Crow cannot compete against Pam, Poco, and Gene with star power. This cannot continue.
---
This is great but there‚Äôs only one thing I do for a living at that is judging art .One this is simply marvelous and second ....What is Penny looking at?!?
---
That will be just 25000 tokens for a legendary 
---
ohno hes gonna do it
---
Bro ur photoshopping skills are on another level, jesus murphy
---
Don‚Äôt forget you are a random
---
I've got everything at lvl10 besides Carl who is at lvl9(just waiting on Star-Power) but haven't unlocked spike and I'm almost at 0.3%
---
Pretty accurate 
---
Sure hope so man!
---
How did u get tat barley to be after ur name??
---
Is brawl stars really easy ?i think it's not
---
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
Not bagging your idea. But when I think of showdown, I think of teaming and third party fights. I would imagine a lot of final kill cams would be 2 people fighting to the death and then a third walking into the fight to clean up
---
What if everytime you eliminated a brawler  you mimick that eliminated brawler's color? Or just change colors everytime you eliminate a brawler. I'd buy that in a heartbeat!! 
---
NOBODY is going to being up 50+ dynamikes spinning all at the same time? It wouldn‚Äôt be a battle royale, it would turn into Just Dance, spin to win version
---
Cool
---
wait is this an i miss gf? on this fking sub???? ***UPVOTES***
---
Barbarian in brawl stars confirmed
---
something something ***buy gold bye***
---
This is way better than the boring star power Carl has right now. If they do this, his pickaxe throwing speed should probably be averaged between the current speed and the star power speed
---
saw this coming r/expectedthanos
---
You should create tutorial videos that goes beyond basics... That's a great skill you have there
---
Im kind of new whats bm?

My girl Nita getting a lot of love recently. Thank you for this awesome work!

Yea he got 7 trophies

What's your problem?

You got lucky

that woud make the game better
---
He needs some more health.

Damage is good!!üëçüëç

Lol lucky? Are you salty or what? I used manual-aim to kill him, dude.

This could be a cool game mode ü§î

Belly Drum Sitrus Berry Unburden goooooo

I can see some 3D in there...

I do not think so, movement speed is a really good thing in this game.

A bit slower than the current sp imo.

This is literally one of the most upvoted posts in this sub, why even post it again...?

Sounds like the Lunar New Tear skins which were only available for a limited time
---
The voices in it are all instruments played while their speech shows up above their head.
---
That's what I said
---
This mode is called capturing crystals.
---
Nita is Native American for bear. I‚Äôm not sure which language within Native American it is tho. 
---
What's the point being there if he's never gonna get buff
---
I think the same
---
Btw my phone does funny things on a screenshot sometimes.
---
There was lunar New year where you could get special skins (maybie you can still get them if you wait for another china new year)
---
Is it just a coincidence that he looks like the flash?
---
FREE
---
Not funny! So they bombed Russia, why make a meme from this? This is very serious ....
---
Hello there
---
Cunt are you literally trying to tell me i‚Äôm salty because you think you‚Äôre right after copying the 8 from siege and pastint it onto s showdown loss. Fuck off
---
yes i agree! this is really good as of now! but if EVER supercell comes up with extra trophies for  
---
kills, or if specific player kills gives more exp, then it wouldn‚Äôt be practical otherwise as people could just suicide &amp; not give the extra trophies etc. but that‚Äôs just if it gets implemented.
---
I really like that game stat box!
---
Good job around here (secretly wish that supercell add tool to create your own map and play it in friendly games)
---
Any suggestions?
---
Thank you all so much :)
---
Even me..but this was the latest one
---
I have 4k trophies now
---
She sh*ts them out. Her farts propel her to the skies and she dumps her bombs as she goes up.
---
The game is just unplayable, I was fine with 2D 
---
European ?
---
Very subtle.
---
Good concept.
---
That's tough I'm at 4K and I have a legendary but barely any brawlers 
---
It's fine lol, gj on the idea tho
---
And I only got spike recently
---
Thanks
---
Seems like a good idea to me. üëçSupercell probably wouldn't explain how it helps (the part saying it makes it easier to hit around walls) but that's irrelevant. 
---
awesome, guess i'll give it another month or so. thanks
---
I don‚Äôt think this is better tbh, it is the same as Darryl, but Carl isn‚Äôt a fighter/heavyweight.
---
North American 
---
Some people don't have time and he wanted BO. So I returned his favor. If somebody pushes your account for free because you are good friends you would let your friend do it as well. Won't you?
---
Hi someonehci

RIP google assistant

That's so cool! I've seen clay art vids on YouTube (there's one on Pokemon) and they're fun to watch.

Then there's a glitch bc that's what I saw... :/
---
I agree
---
I did think that to, then I should‚Äôve deleted that, thanks anyway :)
---
Breast are hard to draw I know...
---
How would you imagine that? 
---
50 teaming dynamikes or pams in the middle. 
---
You done GUCCI boi

Maybe a 5 second lag in which time he killed someone?

Yeah wtf is up with star powers just straight up increasing stats?
---
How are your 3D studies going
---
Crow feels more like a Greaser era type of guy , what with him being a biker and his speech pattern 
---
Good thinking but he definitely didn't have a super charged yet. 
---
that's why i use Bandita Shelly!
---
It wasn‚Äôt 100% clear in the clip so let me explain: The gem crate was at 500 and the Jessie fires. Right before the energy ball hit the crate, my team won.
---
Nice
---
And yet it happened... 
---
wow this is really good, i‚Äôm impressed! 
---
You were there?
---
It would be a 30-50 gem skin, as the launcher doesn‚Äôt really change, and that just makes me wanna buy it even harder.
---
lolllllll
---
Totally thought that gun was a bong. 
---
This is probably one of the best star power suggestions I‚Äôve seen before... well done...
---
Crow and Spike should be between wild west and mystical because they're myatical creatures and also fit wild west theme
---
That is actually a pretty good one. Rework the start power 
---
This was my first legendary as well, I also didn‚Äôt know he was a legendary and didn‚Äôt freak out at all

I know! I just had no ideas at all!
---
*supers into enemy team*
---
Why the fuck are reposting this? It's on the front page!
---
Ok I did
---
Because being maxed is playing the real, full brawler. The lvl system is a cash grab, lol. Why do you think friendlies are always maxed?
---
It is treason then...
---
does the fact that Shelly is at power level 10 + star power not unbalance the match a bit?
---
While the player may not have many trophies surely if their shelly is at level 10 they are an experienced player
---
btw there are some in the middle too, next to the puddles of water and inside that circle
---
So crow is the final boss
---
Are you stupid? This game is only F2P because other players pay for you to play. If everyone was F2P supercell would go bankrupt and this game wouldn't exist. Smh.
---
So pretty! I wish they would've posted this on there english channel as well.
---
Can't be pam.

Pam is to dummy thicc.

The ball would have merged with pam.

Why is it unfair? the first 100 trophies mean nothing.. you can get them in 10 mins in showdown

HOW THICK IS HER NECK
---
*cries in cactus*
---
My mini has crow at around 1k2 and my main account is at 6k5 but still no legendary. Wanna move to my mini.
---
At least a ticketed event is not ranked so it‚Äôs not as rage
---
r/PunPatrol here! Get on the ground!
---
First you repost. Second you ask for like. What the hell is wrong with you
---
Shelly is op tho
---
Nothing wrong here... you wouldnt complain if they were 50 trophies below you...
---
They add a troll brawler that everyone gets for one day but the attack kills yourself
---
Im not saying they cant be maxed im just saying why the heck do i get matched up with them when im at 10k at they are at 4k? Also the fact that they are maxed which probably influences MM which is why i get paired with them
---
This is how you catch them.

---
This ain't my first rodeo
---
How to do this?
---
I like the way his other skin is literally a recolor, that's overpriced
---
I recommend a change, the two obstacles on the left and right sides, look like Nazi symbols, should probably fix that
---
Good job
---
Phenix crow
---
drum slurpuff with sitrus berry is devastating after u take down all their tanks.
---
this proves that the supercell does not like us
---
when i play against Crow hes never a danger for me. he does little to nothing damage. he doesnt have any health so when youre close to him hes useless. all brawlers except crow can kill many brawlers alone, but Crow isnt really a counter to any brawlers
---
Colt is actually very useful
---
Do I still need to answer?
---
EEELLLLL PRIIIMOOOOOOOOOO
---
Brawlstats has a trophy graph for each brawler
---
I got spike at like 3000, got leon at like 4500. And bought crow from shop like 2 weeks ago at 6,5k
---
i got 2 tickets
---
I am actually The leader of Frost Apex. The proud leader.
---
nice info. is there something like this for other boxes?
---
Find who?
---
No legendary at 5.7K
---
2/3 Mythics hmmm
---
Spike would make this mode unplayable
---
Upvote for effort
---
10 gold = 5 power points lol same value. 
---
Usually support just tells you that you should‚Äôve secured your account but good luck changing it back
---
Legendaries? I dont have even mysthics with 6k trophies! Supercell has been trolling me hard on this one.
---
I am by no means good at Mortis, but just play with him a while.
---
You'll be pissed because he got stuck in walls and because autoaim screwed you. And you will start to be mindfull of those things.
---
Avoid shotgunners and primo, learn how much you deal in a combo and how many hits you need to get your super. Don't use him in heist and siege, don't try to carry gems unless you need to. As mortis you want to go to the backline and upset some people, so you might die as well.
---
Leon at 10.4k
---
What do I do man! I just want another name change so I can change it back!
---
Your post has been removed, make sure to use the body of a post to elaborate on the title.

AND I can‚Äôt seem to find ‚Äúreal‚Äù support! It always brings me to automated support!
---
I do not agree. I got several brawlers to 500 on siege such as Frank, Primo, Penny, Bull, and Pam.
---
It think it is fun and enjoy it more than gem grab. What I do miss is when heist was more relevant.

Ohh..are you trying to kill crows of that nation...i thought they were killing humans...
---
New box in game,maybe!!!
---
90's are adults now.
---
We can only play Crow on solo sd. Make him more viable by buffing his health. His damage with poison is ok.
---
Yaaaaas!
---
Like I said above, I have Crow.
---
He used to be broken too.
---
Either way, legendaries aren‚Äôt easy to get so you should be grateful you got one. 
---
Even after the nerfs they are both usable, and leon is still very strong if used right.
---
Best one yet maybe
---
Itd Hard to explain
---
Crow doesnt need a buff!
---
I'm get 14 coins,I'M THE BEST!!!!
---
Pretty sure that's what everyone said about mortis before he was reworked
---
Looks like a better feast of famine
---
Brawl stars main page, and there are these boxes like humor, ideas, etc. in different colors. Click on one and press top and for how long post been out. That's on my pc. I only use reddit here. But I'm pretty sure it will be somewhere on the main page for mobile, you may have to scroll around and look for it   :1
---
This is lovely, that determination in her side eye. Do piper next
---
Bull+Pam=Bam
---
ü§îHm.... Try to explain...
---
Otherwise really good, but my only critique is that they don't look very much like what they look like in the game. (They could pass as older versions, maybe that's what you intended, but great piece of art never the less.)
---
Didn't try it yet but whenever I encountered an opponent lvl10 penny, the mortar was really pain in ass
---
There are bushes to sneak and flank so she might be counter-able

Hmmmmmmmm

I'm not so sure though because I've never been on mobile which you may be on.

I have 8500 trophies and no legendary...

Penny, watch out, because this is dangerious!

I think his damage needs a small buff

Like that.

Wow!

ü§îhm...i cant...im to weak

This is funny!

me to i think everyday you wil get free brawl box and if ticketed event ope the daily reward will be 3 free tickets
---
True.
---
Judging by the number of trophies either you are very lucky or you spent you income on this game lol
---
Supercell has said that they have no plans to remove it in Brawl Stars and that it is here to stay.
---
Sorry to say that but if you lost 30 times in a row you are probably the bad random !

I'm saying it shouldn't matter. Otherwise there's no real incentive to grind star powers at all since everyone you play will end up having it. ( ofc in robo rumble it'll be nice, but won't be fair )

I‚Äôm not complaining - I was giving him his answer. And I never said I was maxxed. I‚Äôm still missing star powers so gold is important.

Spike is in the west same as crow look at the bs trailer

Sshhh let‚Äôs let sleeping crowd lie. I‚Äôd rather stick with the lousy crow version

Oh...

Lol he doesn't get it and some others prob won't

Wow I can relate hard on this one... you won‚Äôt believe how many trophies I lost just by playing siege with people with freakin star power...

I can't read that shit
---
Ik it sounds fake,but I promise it isn‚Äôt 
---
Uhhhh he used to be absolutely broken in beta, like in the same tier as Leon was before it was nerfed (but without Leon‚Äôs star power). Of course his play style was different but he wasn‚Äôt as fragile and it was a lot easier to dodge shot back then as well which also made him easier to play. His Super charged a lot faster, and he had a lot higher damage. 
---
It says humor
---
Maybe they're working on a bigger update. 
---
Your argument sounds legit, but I don't think I get the basis of it. Do you mean you will loose more due to the time? Because sd is still a minute less than seige, so maybe rephrase it? 
---
I don‚Äôt care lol
---
Maybe...
---
lmaoo
---
I have enough gems to buy Phoenix Crow but I can resist (I think.......)
---
The old lore for Crow was extremely wild west tho: ‚ÄúThis magical creature just appeared in town one day, no one dares to ruffle his feathers. Not anymore.
---
Poop
---
If you can't read apologies 
---
Also if your using a phone you could soon in btw
---
No.
---
But as you admitted, without decent team mates, it‚Äôs near impossible to get shit done. Where as if I have like Gene in gem grab, I can straight carry.
---
Maybe not 3s but nice idea
---
It would get pretty unbalanced, I like the idea though :)
---
This is a really good idea! As someone who likes to give balance ideas, i approve

The character names at the bottom are centered with the title, it's bugging me... Otherwise this is great!
---
And I thought I played a lot of Brawl Stars... Only reached the limit xp once. At least I've never let my tokens get full since I started playing. 
---
I was very surprised to discover I am(according to Kairos) a pro. 
---
10/10 for picture clarity
---
If I remember correctly, only legendary brawler chance goes up
---
Hey im dusan plz and carl
---
I strongly agree. Or at the very minimum get end game emotes or thumbs up or down. Often I‚Äôve gotten terrible teammates, either afk or just bad and I would like to let them know we lost because of them. 
---
Im like 6 months wo a brawler.... Almost everyone at 9 and still 0 legs and missing Carl and Gene... 
---
Lololol
---
I respect that, but I don't know, i liked Brawl Stars because of the quick experiences, and now i need a team and be competitive to get a star token easily xD jk i play with randoms and still win but i still don't like it
---
You gotta get it!
---
supercell cant fucking calculate teams literally in brawlball I was qued with a rico and dynamike and i played primo and the other team had a shelly darryl and bull. Next game, I played pam cued with a colt and a barley while the other team had bull colt and shelly. Makes complete fucking sense
---
But he is still the best :D
---
This is beautiful 
---
Call me lucky, got a brawl box today nbd
---
Piper says hi

Shelly says hi

It's a fixed value, only legendary drop rate can change, it's written right there...
---
u/William_Kraus
---
Yeah since the siege update i've only played showdown, and since there's only 1 showdown rotation mostly only with modifiers and shitty maps, ive played alot less
---
Animal is true! 
---
Not quite sure what you are complaining about...
---
Man that's rough. Such a well timed play too. F
---
Lol, i played a random day and got like -30 just because of matchmaking and still i needed to get the star token :(
---
Hohoho
---
Can I have your autograph? So I'll have it when supercell hires you
---
can you all stop complaining, it‚Äôs free. they don‚Äôt owe you anything in a free game
---
I found 5 brawlers, how much you find? 
---
Yes it is possible because of the time. Like a  rank 0 brawler in seige is going to get -5 trophies per loss and a rank 20 will lose -12 or so. And seige is 5 minutes and sd is 4.so a rank 0 brawler in sd will lose -0 in 10th place (sounds wront but it's happened to me a few times ive lost 0 in 10th with my brand new brawlers lol) and a rank 20 brawler will lose -7 or -8 due to time. Understand? 
---
This! 
---
And it depends of the number of brawlers you have
---
I have 10 max brawlers also f2p 
---
I am. At 5k
---
Mike wazowski
---
*Cursed*
---
Thank you :D
---
I made this same suggestion as well! It was on one of the buff carl posts. It's a really good suggestion because movement speed is what really synergizes with this character considering that movement speed is a factor for changing the direction of his axe and it's what makes his super good. It allows for his ultimate to have 100% fast speed uptime. Instead of a gradual increase.
---
You play it on Portuguese? Wtf that‚Äôs lame 
---
Well, considering that their work is playing/producing content for Brawl Stars yeah I do think they have a good understanding concerning what Brawlers are viable in the meta. Also you can check yourself: it‚Äôs very unusual to see Crow outside of Showdown and there is an obvius reason for that. You can argue that it‚Äôs a very sensitive case (buffing Crow) because he is already good in Showdown and buffing him could make him a bit OP in THAT game mode. Imo that‚Äôs why Supercell gave him such a small buff. But Crow is underpowered when compared to a lot of different Brawlers when playing other game modes. Btw I managed to put my Crow at 660 trophies playing only Solo Showdown so I‚Äôm not a complete newbie using him. 
---
Big facts. I am very badass!  I use Genepool or Barley to own the world.
---
This exact thing happened to me but i killed my phone cover instead lol
---
I would love to see that,Only because I'm curious
---
Holy shieet
---
Exactly, that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm wondering why ppl are suggesting it
---

---
They aren‚Äôt begging for upvotes, they are just saying if they get 15 they will do Mortis.  Begging is saying ‚Äúupvote this and you will get free gems‚Äù
---
Nerf crow, he is so overpowered
---
Could brawl stars even run than. 
---
??
---
His axe is "unburdening" him when it leaves. I like the name "Iron Steed" but unburden makes sense.
---
Thanks for seeing the detailsüòä
---
My brother likes it, that pretty much it

---
Hahaü§£ü§£
---
*You have to say "r/MortisGang assembel/rise up"*
---
First of all, a max level Poco wipes a max level Crow is 5 hits, not 3 (usually killing in 4 hits, but with Crow's star power, it's 5). This means that Crow will actually WIN this matchup point-blank if he has his star power. If they are not close enough for crow to hit with all daggers, he will run away with his much faster move speed and longer range.
---
As you may know, Crow also has his Super. It charges faster than Poco's if all daggers hit, about the same if two daggers hit, and slower if only one hits. Crow's Super also does at least twice as much damage as Poco heals (four times as much if including the daggers on both jumps).
---
Also, Crow is better in more game modes: He is great in showdown, decent in gem grab, and can be used in brawl ball (though extremely team-specific). Poco, meanwhile, is only a barely decent gem carrier.
---
In conclusion, don't need to dodge if it's too far away, can't heal if you're already dead, and I am playing Brawl Stars.
---
PS: r/usernamechecksout
---
Trust me they do.
---
Also, I meant to improve it so like in other games it would say"bot 9 died in the gas cloud while escaping bot 3"
---
Carl one throw slot
---
How do you have 10 max brawlers at 5k if you‚Äôre free to play. Or did I just miss something 
---
So tomorrow?
---
How do you have your star power if you reset your account...
---
Straight up I would probably just keep that one brawler low forever so I can play siege without losing 80 trophies to get the star token 
---
:(
---
\#SHELLYSUPER
---
Yes, but maybe make the circle in middle grass not only the lines
---
Yeah but it actually acts so weird though. Before it rolls like a normal ball but now when you kick it after it travels like 7 tiles the travelling speed decreases by like half and then it rolls for like another 3 or 4 tiles and it stops like wtf sometimes idk if it even is suppose to go in the goal or not
---

Everyone ask me this question
---
I started playing when this game came (1st day)
---
That time it was very easy to max out brawlers so I did but I played only a few months( like 5) amd left the game as they removed tap to shoot and portrait mode amd now I started again 
---
Lol how stupid can u be

I feel like the issue is that people insist on playing their favorite brawlers without taking into account if they're actually useful on that game mode / map. I always try to play with brawlers which I think they are useful for this game mode and most of the time I end up with +10/+30 trophies playing with randoms before I switch to other stuff.
---
Should call it "Close Fight or no Fight"

Oof, I hope that doesn't mean the update is gonna take very much longer

I don't think so, since "next couple weeks" includes April fools day...
---
And the other spawns?
---
Adios, amigo.
---
Basically Ryan‚Äôs from the PR team and he doesn‚Äôt do any game developing stuff. So he can easily do the PR stuff (like brawl talk), while the devs simultaneously develop stuff.
---
Because there's so many replacements to Poco.
---
Let's see: Barley is a better controller and deals more consistent damage, Primo is a great gem carrier with his escape Super, and, worst of all, Pam is basically all that Poco is, but ten times better. Crow doesn't have a replacement for his "health control" job. Once he gets his star power (which everyone thinks is trash), he becomes a true beast at support. It changes so many matchups it's crazy.
---
Also, what modes is Poco good in exactly, except for being an extremely replaceable gem carrier (the least important gem grab role)?

I mean ig that's why supercell avoids buffing them. To make them viable in top lvl gameplay would mean they would be way too op in lower trophies. Sucks for Shelly and bull ig
---
I like the idea but the super seems a little underpowered; too much like mortis‚Äô main attack. Maybe she has like 2 or three teleports in one super but that seems to OP. Hmmmm. Have to find a way to figure that out but I like the idea.

If you mean a flying character that flies purely as a design choice, sure, but if you mean a character that can only be attacked by specific characters like in clash royale, that‚Äôs a big no no.
