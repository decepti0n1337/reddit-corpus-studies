---
Ok

and make it double
---
I like Penny’s Artwork more here idk why
---
Learn how to play the game, it shouldn’t tell you what everyone has that ruins the whole element of it.
---
Lol happens all the time when I spectate, really is disappointing but nothing you can do about it
---
I really wish there was light mecha crow
---
It’s probs a modded version of the game
---
Make America great again box

That’s exactly what happened to me with my rank 19 Leon

Don't mess with my crew!

I was actually fine with Carl except for his super ..but I had a really hard time getting used to Rosa's range
---
Definetely! What would we do without that 300 gold?!

My boi can sing better than Taylor Swift

I always hit my mark!

Don’t you dare make brawl Stars related to attack on Titan

Congrats on your rewards. I just hit 12 K today

I think Brawl Ball was the worst... but funniest.  Nobody won, 0 to 0. If all 3 players are even half competent it’s actually impossible to get the ball and do anything. Maybe if you could coordinate all 3 supers... but dang. Nobody could do a damn thing haha.
---
10th lose -6 and 5th gain +1 (400+Trophies)

The other things are exactly

Might've been me lol

---
true beauty in its prime
---
thank you! ❤️❤️
---
This has been happening for a long time, that mortis and someone else on the other team planned to have the mortis throw their game for trophies. Some top players have done this
---
jessie
---
It’s even worse for me because I already have the Christmas Nita :/
---
I need shelly power points
---
After what update?
---
Make spike
---
nooo 😭 only the picture is referenced but not the story hehe
---
Thank youuu ❤️
---
Thought of this as well. Either that or they should add it right next to their hp bar just like on the menu. Would be useful to know if a shelly is gonna heal after you damage her enough or not.
---
Cool
---
How's the trip to the cigarette store
---
Wait what, I am 100% certain I checked and read the whole thing and I saw nothing about rank ups and star points, I am positive you only get them for trophy decay.
---
I have ranked up a couple brawlers and haven’t received star points, now I am just confused.
---
The update where there isn’t a confirm
---
Button
---
aahhh thank you ❤️
---
Too difference which star power is, I mean, under the brawler don’t show the logo
---
Nope, I got em when I ranked up.
---
You also don’t have to post this 3 times
---
The hell did i just watched
---
*phew* It is a nice picture you have very good and it is so well referenced
---
If you don't know how to play poco aggressively then sure walls are gonna be an issue for ya and if you don't know how to play him aggressively but safely then sure you're gonna die a lot hence the, 
---
"Sure if you don't know what you're doing.".
---
this is the best comment for this artwork I've read yet. needs more updoots
---
I wish I had limited skins ( I didn’t start playing till late December)
---
That’s a good idea totally useful !
---
Skills are based on the little red button on the bottom right corner
---
Ohno, i don't want Crow remodel
---
Oof?!?!?
---
Does that mean Rico was shooting pool balls al along?
---
Well true. They all fit well with their own personalities.
---
I agree with the remodel idea except the eye. I like the eye.
---
I'm aware of that but how does that fit into the meme.
---
consider yourself lucky I didn't get a mythic until 6k and I still dont have a legendary at 9.4k trophies
---
Wow
---
Yesh
---
I ain’t fat, I’m big boned.
---
leon doesnt have eyes
---
Aren’t glitches and bugs the same thing

Please upvote this post
---
Love to see that
---
Except the eye
---
Really
---
MAGA box.... I like it
---
I see this as an absolute win since I lose 37 games in a row
---
Why tho i still dont get it. Im at 6.2k trophy
---
those are some short legs
---
So you are the person Coach Cory was talking about.
---
I am very slowly getting upvotes lol
---
Me too
---
Fricken lucky
---
It's a battlefield out there me boy, arghhhh ya dad lost his leg trynna maintain the wall to keep those Karens out me boy.
---
It was actually inaccurate since... global?
---
Yep
---
Well shit good luck dad
---
🤣🤣🤣
---
Yes. We could go for better saturation and darker colors but keep the eye.
---
Just awesome
---
one day. one day.
---
Make a chinese new year version
---
Thanks i hate it
---
500-600 feels like how showdown was for the old 300-500 range, but I can't say anything for 600-700 since I never pushed a brawler that far.
---
That head tho
---
It’s super easy to push with him on heist don’t even bother playing other game modes
---
As a Darryl main... 
---
#IF
---
I don't like solo showdown. It's not fun for me
---
Thanks for the advice
---
F, i got this brawler when it was named "ricochet"
---
Cursed
---
Nice
---
Yeah it just happened again I got into a game but the opposite team was broken gene with 200 power 1 leon with 250 power 5 and tara with 67 power 7
---
Fair enough
---
This post is misleading as it is tagged as a replay however as I looked at the post there was no replay. My disappointment is unmeasurable and my dad is ruined
---
Ha.
---
Some people simply misunderstood it, including me, for a bit, no reason to go after them for it. Supercell wasn't specific with the fact that "star point are achieved through rank ups," so some people thought it was through every rank up. However don't be mad at them for it, it was a simple mistake you should understand.
---
But I would rather get only ONE legendary instead of all these LOL
---
Tara?
---
That crap happened to me 4 times
---
Kyle
---
The eye told me so
---
The good old days.
---
Uhh... Tick?
---
u/VredditDownloader
---
Hey Kyle
---
How did you do it
---
Once a Mike left a box unattended, it had 6hp
---
Oh didn’t even notice that until you pointed it out lol, I was mostly complaining about the double crow teams
---
Actually that's incorrect, *Popcap* fired the PvZ creator over P2W mechanics. Popcap wanted to make more money far before EA bought them
---

---
I see no difference

Oh

Oh. Even Tick? I have trouble playing him

I like how you integrated their in game voices in this

FortNite bad

&gt;1.chaotic battle moment, i can stone them and escape.(and it would be really funny when they come back)(for showdown)
---
It does nothing in showdown.
---
&gt;2.as you said(collect gems, save teammate, etc.)

It would be nice to know what this brawler's attack is.

I was about to ensaltify myself for what u spoke of El Primo, but then relaxed after Mortis' opinion xd

Agreed.
---
🅱️ruh
---
I get it but i mean i feel it's..don't want to say unnecessary but i feel it wouldn't really add or take away from the game. If the star power is good people are gonna be using the same one.. And if it's different it's bc one person didn't get it yet. Cool idea tho. Would be different. If they did add this. It'd be later when they're all out
---
True
---
shut up pp head
---
I have no idea if I like this or not lmao
---
_Useless!_
---
Crow, you are next!
---
Well with the new (shit) trophy system they added you can lose more than you win and still get 500 because it’s not a -5 +5 system 300 -500
---
You bet

Scroll of thruth

it was lol

true, i love the remodel but it would be cool if theres a skin similar to the og one

Where's the originality to that? If it's just spikes super but nails

Oh well sorry Bibi is a girl?
---
You keep losing hp, but you heal from damaging others. The fact that it deals with teamers is the best reason to play it
---
Yeah
---
I'll hold you to it robo. Now throw me all your posion...

Why is everyone saying that Rico is a nice guy and that he’s in love with piper ?

Bad meme repost, but good format

I can't, this is a bug that appened to me in game yesterday

Hello, I am from the future to say that it's basically canon now that she is. No way they would give "Konichi-WHACK" and "Sayonara" as voice lines if she wasn't intended to be Japanese.
---
Make a one with duo sd
---
Lol
---
#EEEEEEEEELLLLLLLL PPPPRRRIIIIIMMOOOOO
---
Because the nails stick targets to walls also, not just a ground attack. The radius of blast is wider for surrounding walls. Not completely like Spike.
---
Ha
---
Make her hug her gun :o
---
*hello*
---
Amazing
---
**hello**
---
That is cute
---
Jeezzz wp op
---
my advice is to try to improve your overall trophies at the begining until you get a brawler to at least rank 6. at rank 6 you can try to just push that brawler but I still dont recomend. with each rank up on each brawler you get tokens allowing you to get more boxes quickly and allowing you to get more new brawlers. set some brawler trophy or rank goals for all brawlers. i first set the goal to get all of my brawlers to rank 10 then 15. i was working on getting all my brawlers to 17 but since trophies are easier to get now with high trophy brawlers i am pushing some of my brawlers to 20 because of the update.
---
&gt;!hello!&lt;
---
Is that a threath?
---
right.
---
Panda Nita is not just a different model
---
yeah. i still feel sad that i was too late to get the megabox before it got replace to tick
---
I don't understand. Can you explain this?
---
Jesus christ please don't be him
---
Yeah, can understand that, however I'm on the other side, just got the mega box then they came out with tick :P
---

Im guessing gene isnt on here because he is a 50/10 and his voice is beyond human comprehension
---
**K O N N I C H I W H A C K**
---
Pennys sister Rusty. Now I saw everything
---
i had a chance to get a legendary or a mythic then tick
---
Nice spoiler
---
Tick is a Bob-omb in a mech suit change my mind.
---
Did you mean Valve ?
---
Oh no.
---
hell yeah
---
You have a chance for a legendary or a mythic from every box
---
Spiky
---
You didn’t say it the poster did so i was adding on to ur point
---
Oh, ight
---
I have my skills to pay the bills
---
F. 1260 hp  every 20 seconds. Not  worthh it inn this mode at all
---
How does the remodel look any different from the old one besides for the eye ?
---
hopefully today i get crow i really want crow
---
Does anyone else hate the fact that this template is missing an 's'?
---
No ot is a brawl stars remake of the sword of truth

Wow I was beginning to think the glitch was close to impossible to do

Ummmm he know he is no skill

If this is true, the fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh week will have new Star Powers for me.

Wow a bowl of ✅  meat ball

IT DOESN'T EVEN LOAD THE VIDEO REEEEEEEEEE

Get a better phone then
---
That fact that everyone has a this new brawler? Probably Not.
---
nEw mETa? yEEEEEs
---
How tf can you make that mistake, there was literally no good reason to go back there
---
In... showdown?
---
I guess it is that golden fast BOI I mean the egg robo
---
The remodel le actually gold the bad thing is the voice but i think dupercell want to work on the story of the caracther (the 2nd eye on his head) tara dont speak its the "spirit" of the eye

Yeah, im bouta hit 11.5k and thanks to that 150 gold i will only be needing another 17k!

1. If you need to go, at least wait until the last 5 seconds. There is a 10 second timer before the AI kicks you out if you close the app. If you do so, you’ll guarantee yourself the trophies. If you got connection issues, that’s just bad luck.
---
2. That’s exactly why supercell added this mechanic: so that people don’t leave the app without consequences. If they didn’t add that mechanic, there would be an ungodly surge of trolls doing these crappy acts to piss people off. Again, if you have connection issues, I can understand that it annoys you, but supercell cannot control your internet, so they have to focus on the players who would leave on purpose.
---
Lmaoiania
---
Mortis reads shakespeare
---
Yeah that’s true, but I still prefer the normal skins like whit bo and dark crow
---
Actually in Mortis's lore he eats people and he eats dynamikes
---
Gold crow, night crow, gold bo, light bo, blue bull, black colt.
---
***i think the fastest BOI a live***
---
Carrion Crow will be annoying as hell
---
What the fuck supercell

I heard you are having a hard time controlling your Canary or is it now controlling you?

ah yes sorry frogot about that one

 Hello Devs, I would like to thank you for making such a great game. I really enjoy it. However since the new update Tick (the new brawler) is too OP which shift to game balance. His crowd control is so high and when matching with Bo it's like invicinble in gem grab. I would suggesting Nerfing it's range (it seems that its range is \~ piper), his damage is too high(2 mines are already \~ Dynamike which most of the time will hit), Reload time is too fast while explosion time is too slow (--&gt; He can keeps spamming mines to gain absolute Crowd Control which is quite annoying) I would say let the mine explode when it hits the ground, it is much better. In solo showdown, Ticks team up with each other which is the worst. Tick just ruins the fun experience of the brawlers, Spike is now hopeless with its short range and low health with Tick going around spamming mines. Please fix this issue asap. Thank you, Brawler
---
I'm praying to god this is a troll because crow sure as hell dont need no gotdamn buff

2 starpoints I guess

But... you are a r as ndomas well, no? 🤔

Tara wears a mask. Off course what she says isn't gonna be heard clearly!! Besdes Tick is a robot and his voicelines sound like one.

2. Her other real eye was lost in the Vietnam War and the PTSD treatment caused a mutation and she grew the bling eye on her forehead. This is well known.
---
How do you know her whole head isnt a ton of eyes?
---
I had 0,25 as well and them i got spike
---
ok
---
They should make  a daily chest like in clash royale
---
Maybe the dude doesnt have as much brawlers as you so his trophy count is lower
---
Also it was a while ago (old shop)
---
It makes sense, Jessie and colt are related and when colt gets hurt he says “I want my mommy!” And Pam is a healer so colt is saying he wants his mommy (Pam) to heal him, and colt uses guns like bull and Jessie uses a turret like Pam so there’s a likely these four are related.

bulls star power would be good on mortis i tried it with the friendly match glitch it would be the best starpower for him.

In siege she's more useless

Tara doggo has some damn good cards

Yeah and? They also need time to develop the next update
---
THAT makes me think... Thanks for the feedback

You dont simply "get" Mortis. You must go through many trials to prove you are worthy of his power.

Lovely! Thanks for the brilliant info!

Damn. Brock got buffed

I like how the brock missed his first shot

Totally fine. The most satisfying thing was obliterating that robot with few attacks
---
No sorry, but probably forever or till the end of summer, either case.
---
For real can somebody explain to me why it's always like this?
---
I mean you might think the probabilty that the enemy team has a bad player is equal. Wrong
---
If you play with a friend and you need 1 random you will more likely get a powerlevel 10 shelly.
---
I can check their profile after the game and I know beforehand that they have 1 brawler on powerlvl 10 and thats her shelly with 350 cups. 
---
Come on matchmaking. I'd rather take a powerlevel 5 mate that has some sort of brain instead of those shellys named "CR7" with no gameplan whatsoever.

Oh sorry I didn't notice the recent project that now real apes play this game.

Do NOT check the bush right behind you. In fact, you should go towards it because there is defenitely NOT a mortis inside.

So far from the truth😂

They use mortis to attract all the bots and dash around the map while the other 2 take out the boss
---
What do u mean?
---
I really want the light bo skin and I'm scared I can't get enough starpoints till it's gone.
---
Do you know if we get starpoints at the end of the season instead of the tokens at the trophy road or did they remove the tokens completely and added nothing instead?

Try colt with brock's star power
---
She's really good in brawl ball
---
Jeez I'm just trying to ask man.
---
You are, look at your responses! You're a really good drawer! Good luck with the next ones! I'll be definitely waiting for them in every single second!  (BTW I followed you on Twitter and YouTube)

That's crow with frank's star power
---
HOOOOOOOGGG RIDEEEEERRRRRRR

I know but I was just displaying how it would work in friendlies
---
What about me?
---
What does that have to do with this post?

imagine playing this shit game and taking it so seriously like lol
---
Its a good thing, right?

That's very sweet of you! Thank you ❤️ I'll study art more so I can eventually teach art on yt 😀

It’s the same bug, with another star power

I knew that Frank is gay...

Tick is the best thrower that can kill Mortis for me. Just place some mines in one spot near you and go there, or just use your super

Maybe Tara IS the eye. And Kyle is the body.
---
I found Mortis and Tara around the same 2 weeks, then Gene and Spike (I don't remember the time correctly, but it was around the same month if not weeks.

It is sureley Bibi. and she is bisexual. she has the bisexual bob. it HAS to be her.

I know Bender when I see him

I’m gonna fucking say it, Bibi trans confirmed.

When did i say that? I just said that he should complain because he has more chance to get a star power then for one of us to get a lagendary
---
Man I have him at power level 9 and I tilted from 460 to 398... my favorite guy but I’m not having the best of luck. I’m saving my gold and boxes for when his next star power drops tho. It’s gonna be epic when you do manage to trip people up
---
So Tick doesn't have a dad
---
Btw Leon is in the back.

Well if the bear has Hyper Bear it could win but if it doesn’t than the head could win

Thank you :)!
---
Isn’t the sword of truth just a remake of the scroll of truth tho?
---
Yeah the clay art is not tick on gem grab though when he makes the gem spawn a damn mine field
---
You are correct when you say this game is simple, but that doesn’t mean you have mastered it already, act like you have mastered strategy all you want but you can’t prove it until you get a brawler to 10 and push past 700 in gem grab or siege. The gap between f2p and p2w players is not as high in this game as others, yes the new star powers are pretty broken but in the end the game is more dependent on matchup than anything else.
---
Mortis cannot effectively beat a close ranged brawler ever, but throwers feel the same way when facing him, and sharpshooters like Colt and Rico hate facing brawlers like Crow or Carl because their projectiles are near impossible to dodge consistently meaning they’ll win almost any 1v1 on open ground. Being good at this game is putting yourself in a position to deal with everything as best as you possibly can while still providing value to your team. 
---
Some brawlers like Mortis do this by being super aggressive, though aiming and attacking with mortis may not seem that complicated the process is difficult because you need strategy. 
---
You have to pay attention to where your opponents teammates are, how much ammo they have, etc, this is something unique to Mortis that other brawlers don’t have to worry about because they either have high stats or long range to stay out of any real trouble. Mortis is similar to long ranged brawlers because he has no trouble reaching his opponents or getting away, so if you are able to plan out your rushes well you can be incredibly annoying to the enemy team.
---
This game is harder than you think and less p2w than you think, instead of conceding to the idea that teaming is the only way to get trophies try playing in a manner that will help you improve, because what good is having 500 trophies if you give up at the sight if an El Primo, a brawler that Mortis can actually pester very easily because of his short range and long lasting attack animation. Literally Anybody can get to 500 even without maxed brawlers, it just takes time, persistence, and teaming, and if a teamer can do the same thing you can then you aren’t good, not yet.
---
Players that get to 900 don’t play showdown.
---
Oh hi its you
---
go away
---
That's what I did when I started playing the game
---
Yeah right? I get that in some games like TLOU can be something that affects the history in some ways but in games like this? It's just stupid
---
bull
---
Depends on your goals. If you want higher overall trophy profile, better to spread your gold out to level up all brawlers. If you want to see how high you can get with one brawler, then level up the one obviously.
---
Why is this posted twice
---
Bibi?
---
It's better this way
---
But I used to hate the 10 tropheys aspect. I know it would have been really bad for tropheys pushing but if like me you played for fun, I always thought it would be nice to have everything the same as it was before except it was only worth 5 trophies cos seige was probably the most fun gamemode
---
man how do you people do it, I can’t seem to do it and I’m doing the same techniques you guys do
---
I think it’s Spike

Maybe I should be like bob from meme review #15 on coach cory's channel

---
WINGS OF GLORY
---
Yeah, I hope it doesn't get removed, looks like a interesting thing to try out, perhaps even make it official in friendly games?
---
What!
---
Select brock and then change to colt and then fast ready. You should do that fast
---
This has been an issue forever. I'm really surprised it's not been fixed yet. Super irritating (pun intended)
---
Maybe it is. I needed clarification as to if it is a bug or a feature.
---
My Rico at the moment, I'm rank 19.
---
Barleys is pretty good, for example his super says things like "do you want ice whit that? " or "a little strong? " making fun of his bartender appearance
---
Cool :3

WoW. How did that happen?
---
~Thank you!~
---
I don’t get your point... spinning has many meanings in brawl stars and that spin obviously didn’t mean “let’s team”. It was way more of a “GG” spin then anything else. What’s wrong with him spinning
---
Nope lol
---
Shelly? I think a lot of people think shes Bi but don't acknowledge or discuss it

What I said when I read the title. LMFAO
---
...
---
r/bonehurtingjuice
---
Yes, that’d be great. It’s just frustrating though to see that I avoided the minecart , yet I didn’t.  The mine carts were something of skill: it was a good advantage and I don’t think it was necessary to nerf. It could be used as a defense to block enemy shots, and could be used on offense to lure enemy players into the minecarts. If people have trouble with the map, they should try to learn to use them to their advantage or just not play the map at all.
---
So for all people that dont get it, Tick is... wait.. wat wuz I gonna say? Eh, I'd. Ok bye
---
It’s pretty easy to edit the game files, all you need is Winrar and Microsoft Excel
---
And then it turns to be the legendary you always said it needs to be nerfed
---
yeah xD
---
No, brawl stars match making is kinda dumb, where it matches people with the same trophies as you, your brawler can be max lvl, but if the brawler you're playing with is at 0 trophies, you'll still face off with low levels or bots.
---
There you go
---
Really?
---
i'll probably try to level up all of my brawlers,. Ty for the suggestion :D
---
Did u win?

~~That's cute.~~

You don’t have to show respect you can just ignore it. I fucking hate that literally every company has to put a rainbow flag on pride month. It’s like trying to get respect from the LGBTQ Community.

Etymology doesn’t entirely dictate the meaning of a word. Take peanuts for example. ‘nut’ is in their name, but they aren’t nuts; they’re legumes. Similarly, homophobia isn’t an irrational fear; it’s an irrational contempt.

I’m a fairly new player only playing for about a solid month and a half and recently i’ve been only able to get matchups like this. My team always being brawler levels 6-7 and the opposing team having Level 10s and either 1-2 with Star Powers. Ive been struggling to break 2900 trophies. I win one game and then lose the next 4 due to matchups like this. Is this a common problem among any other players here? Thanks!

Pick a brawler in friendly match who’s super you want to try on another brawler (all don’t work). And then switch to that other brawler and already be tapping Start match button. Sorry I know this may not help but look up Orange Juice’s tutorial on YouTube on how to do it - he explains it pretty well.

This update has been a wonderful overhaul of detail. Tick was both a good idea, and is decently-balanced. The new music bops, and the new Shop UI looks great; more stylish, and fits better with the game's at style.

Only if matchmaking is screwed up. A brawler with that many trophies is going to be easily recognizable to anyone that they match with.

What? No he isn't, he's amazing.

i think this is the first rbrawlstars meme to actually make me burst out laughing

And no u didn't kill them you only did the final shot they killed each other. Also, they weren't teaming. They didn't go for each other because they knew if they did you would clean them up. Stop acting like a pro

You're the third one, who saying this... It's servers, dude... It's huge difference between RU servers and US servers

I dont get how people feel welcomed by a game having their sexuality. Im mexican and i have never felt that a game or media has needed to include a mexican character and its great to have diversity but why put a specifically gay character when none are specified to be straight. It feels like some people are just so needy sometimes
---
Just watch ads on and on, if there is no ads available wait a moment and watch more (would recommend watching YouTube or elxe you get bored)
---
Why do people need someone who looks like them to feel represented? Just because someone looks like you doesn’t mean that are like you. You are YOU. Your appearance has no bearing on what you can achieve, because everyone is equally a human being. That is what people these days need to understand.
---
I also fount some gemgrab minecart maps that didn't make it to the game
---
yea he is really good and annoying in 3v3 especially if you don’t play randomly like most players do with him. GGs man
---
Ok, I meant that is this available for mecha crow, but now I realize that’s a dumb question.
---
But suddenly knokback to the bolt))))

What if the player model changes often cuz Tara is the parasite, that'd be cool

1) shes not weak lmfao, with Rico it should be easy to kill a noob shelly

2) "git gud" you cant get something if u already have it.
---
3) darryl would get shat on by no super shelly lmfao, let alone with super.
---
4) "in most scenarios darryl is better than shelly, never before have I heard such utter bullshit.
---
I cant take u seriously

Try putting this in vertical and reposting it. This deserves so much more attention
---
why is that bad?
---
Noice 👌
---
Even latency does not matter
---
If you're in Russia, you should play in the European servers. Even if you dont, this problem is not caused by that. I'm in Japan and my sim card only allows me to play in the NA server. But I start games at the normal time and aside from a bit of latency, it's good. Your shitty wifi is causing u to die first and not start the game. Stop blaming other things when it's your own problem
---
The Art's not great, but this is still pretty funny.
---
not that much easier. a few hundred doesn't help much
---
It really paid off. Looks very epic. Thank you for sharing this on Reddit.
---
WHAT SUBREDDIT DOES THIS BELONG TO
---
I don’t like it
---
It's just disrespectful. If there was a gg emote for your team to see only, it wouldn't be so disrespectful.
---
Hopefully there will be in the future. Maybe with a animated series 🤔
---
i agree with your agreement
---
Pam, Pam is pan
---
And thats how you carry the team by not letting them carry in gem grab
---
People tend to hang out with people with similar class, race, ethnicity etc. Some people like to be acknowledged of their existence and some don't need that validation as yourself. With me personally, I don't mind if a game is diverse or not but I can see why other people need it.
---
My 2.5 year old son does the same thing. I let him play on try mode sometimes but now he will navigate to an actual game when I am not looking.
---
K lemme fix it real quick
---
I could care less about rosa tbh, i can play her tho i really don't like to,  and have no problems killing her 9/10...
---
Tick is broken,  i honestly expected much more since it takes so damn many trophies to unlock him compared to the other trophy road brawlers.  He's a meme for sure,  a big letdown.  
---
My suggestion to fix him is this:
---
         Shorten his range to that or less of spikes special (before the spread)  make his standard attack detonate immediately upon impact,  and bost his health 800 or so.
---
Man what have you smoked lmao
---

How you got 50k???
---
sorry, I thought you were being sarcastic
---
I love it that you took requests from the community. 
---
I wish I can give you a gold, If I'm not poor :(
---
This is why all the best players don’t play solo showdown, it is a shitty gamemode through and through that only provides any trophy value if you become a vegetable. I personally don’t count solo showdown as a gamemode for these exact reasons, it is just based circumstance and gives you very little power to make choices. 
---
Duo showdown is the same thing but functional because the teams create more distance between opposing sides, it is a bit campier because of the revive mechanic but is also less punishing for those who play a little more aggressively. 
---
I play Duos and gem grab most of the time, duos gives me the power to carry since I only have 1 teammate to worry about. Gem grab can screw you over with bad teammates but if I keep playing I will eventually go positive as long as I am playing a brawler that isn’t complete trash on the current map.
