Because there can no longer be one tile gaps
---
So it breaks the wall
---
Oh, that's just because I've only ever spent ten dollars, from a gift card I was given. So it does count as paying, since I got gems I used to not own, but I spent it on skins because I don't like skipping progression by paying, it's not fun.
---
Don't you mean, _pass_ the word. 
---
So true
---
Tara super chaining is OP
---
OMG I JUST FACED HAYAT TODAY
---
Ayy. 
---
Waste
---
You should become a professional photoshoper
---
Love the idea of little red hood, but tbh i don't like it aestethically
---
Don‚Äôt waste them on a skin.
---
I got 2k gems as a reward, I don‚Äôt spent money on brawlüòùüëå
---
Maybe they can make the goals bigger and still have brawlers spawn in the back of the goal. This‚Äôll make it so that it will take more time for them to reach the field.
---
I was thinkin that was being sarcastic, sorry
---
Only if you have maxed acc imo. I would rather spend my gems on token doubler and event tickets for more boxes then skins. Maybe just me. 
---
Especially in wall-filled maps, just try to avoid confrontation. With dynamike, if you can get close, then you can really mess him up, and barley has low dps, so just try to stay away. You can zone them as well, pushing them out of walled areas. When it's just you and them left, just stall until the poison closes in. If you have a super that can break walls, then you can surprise them, being able to break their cover.
---
Press F to pay respects... Or press G to not pay respects...
---
Love ya
---
I want the old spawns back but with a bloackade for the ball so that you cant corner it
---
I agree, ive been meaning to get skins like Dumpling Darryl but it seems impossible for a player like me because drop chances are unforgiving and they purposefully put them only for a limited time.
---

---
I also missed the christmass skins because of this.
---
Yea it's been happening a lot to me. I hadn't died from it until one showdown today. 10th place hurts. 
---
 
---
Spike took two days.
---
Lol
---
But from their perspective, aren't you a random?
---
yeah it depends on what enemies you get
---
You discussed it at Discord server
---
Mortis is the best, followed by crow &amp; Leon. Pennys turret and Nita‚Äôs bear are also good at them, and brock/ricochet/tanks can work as long as you build up your super really quickly
---
Good
---
Wild. Would love to see how good his squad is. 
---
Stealing posts huh
---
Mortis wrecks throwers. He can dodge their shots super easy and does enough damage to 3 shot them as long as you aren't level 1 and they're maxed or they have a ton of gems in sd or something.
---
Not just older devices. The new update fucked something up. The game crashes now for people too. 
---
omg wow so cool :O
---
Disagree completely. I think it's more fun and competitive now. Way better than before and I hope they don't change it.
---
I didn't play often before, but now, it's amazing!
---
Only my opinion anyway
---
F to pay respects
---
Hide in a bush for all eternity.
---
This just shows how F2P brawl stars is. You dont have to be max to be number 1
---
Of course it is. I was just saying that it's your privilege to see it all the time, comparing to ones who didn't buy the skin and can't even see it as unavailable in the character section.
---
Not only your post. Look at his profile. Every single post he made is stolen. Go and downvote it now. u/FlavioInnocent
---
Of course 
---
Max Bo: **heavy breathing**
---
Honestly that looks pretty fun
---
Goddammit, that's too CUTE X3
---
Pay to progress? Not really win
---
oof my theory then
---
I have all brawlers at 4k trophies yesterday üòÇ I did buy Leon but all other from free brawl boxes üòÇ
---
Because the dbd subreddit is a meme factory.
---
Yeah that was me lol
---
I saw that too, posted it as well to spread the word. Let‚Äôs see what happens 
---
I got crow from a free chest, I have no epics and no mythical though
---
Is it a glitch or intentional?
---
Uh, no sadly but now i have the itch to go check them out.
---
They should let his poison stack. That honestly seems fair
---
finally skinnychet
---
it just happens to be how it is.
---
hope they make the time between shots shorter.
---
ALRIGHT WE NEED BACK UP 
---
The "T" is t posing take it down
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
They need to rework trophy road... 25 power points are also just bs.
---
wow, my technique must be horrible because my Nita is has only 220 trophies and is power level 6 and I feel like I struggle in showdown.
---
Oh man, yes. It's a known bug.
---
STOLEN POST
---
This is true
---
Maybe you'd already opened as many boxes before. Not just because you get a legendary that your x/100 boxes change. For example, if you had opened 92 cases before getting crow, that means even if you got him, it didnt reset it to 0/100. It was still 92/100 therefore you still got a legendary percentage upgrade after reaching the 100 boxes.
---
yeah the one brawler thing
---
I believe you got ponned!
---
with the current state of brawl ball I would rather not lmao.
---
what happend
---
Wait, what if the leon stole this map. JK
---
Same with Penny
---
Same here...
---
Ty!
---
like how u made the complaint in a meme
---
Ikr, total cancer. Join me with trash-talking these retarded posts lol
---
Or game crashes
---
most people dont have maxed brawlers. thats like saying you dont have to worry about dying if your immortal
---
Who doesn‚Äôt know about this? It is every 5th post on reddit -.-
---
r/ihadastroke
---
make it in and ur teamates will lynch u
---
give me your leon 
---
jk
---
Global almost 5k

Some grunts or hmphs would fit his rebellious style.

So we all just commenting on this thread to find our own sugar daddy stranger

finally something funny

Wish I had a hobby like that xD

Repost
---
Crow is one of the most balanced brawlers in the game atm. Stop whining and learn how to play the character. 
---
Shit post 
---
I honestly don‚Äôt like Nita because of that creepy smile. It‚Äôs like something out of DeathNote
---
I do the exact same thing with El Primo but instead of a ram it‚Äôs an elbow drop. 
---
Maybe, but just maybe. We don't have sure.
---
If they don't, this idea would mostly like never happen.
---
Hey, a map that isn‚Äôt an amusement park for Bulls!
---
I have iPhone 6 and that doesn‚Äôt have to me lol
---
Any decent player will easily be able to get at least 5th place. By making killing an incentive, teaming will naturally stop. It isn't uncommon for someone to kill 2-3 people in showdown, so naturally, it will work out. Read the whole thing with your eyeglasses before screaming in all caps.
---
thanks, I have it , but i dont have any gems
---
A lot of these retro skins wouldn't really work. They resemble the current models too much and are overall lower quality.
---
But for Dynamike and Brock, their old designs should definitely be brought back as skins and given new models (because to be honest, they're really low quality. just look at brock's arms)
---
1,3,9
---
Yes, this. Everyone saying she needs it but that‚Äôs such a boring idea and anyone could come up with it, supercell are well known for coming up with cool, different ideas.
---
Oh, I didn't know about the update. I'll download it. Here's hoping it works. Thank you.
---
At that trophy rank, teaming isn't that bad. Only gets worse after Rank 17 I think.
---
Who cares?! 
---
So should they make it so you can only get hit by one brawler at a time? No more picking off someone already engaged in combat? Maybe have the attacker send you a request first to make sure you aren‚Äôt busy and it would be a fair matchup if you graciously accepted their combat invite in a FFA map? See what I‚Äôm getting at here? 
---
Should be an April fools map
---
Yeah, I contacted supercell and they said they're aware of it. It's a pain in the ass. 
---
A ninja one would be perfect. Under the hood, thrownin' dem ninja stars
---
Or two bulls in showdown with a mike
---
*spoiler he dies*
---
I love four boxes except when Rico and Leon sandwich me while I‚Äôm there trying to break the boxes 
---
the piper has 666 trophies
---
Whadda mean?
---
No problem. Tell me if it works after you test.
---
But, know that this is only a potential fix, not guaranteed that this will work. And there will probably have more updates to optimize the game.
---
Yes officer this comment right here
---
Shut your ass up
---
Ik but I want them to have some
---
Happened to me to too.... every single game!
---
Probably just a bug.
---
Gi√†, molti non hanno un vero e proprio senso. Per ora riesco ad associare Stecca, Colt (con la marca di armi da fuoco),  Bull (toro, forse per quel coso che ha nel naso), Dynamike, Frank (Frankenstein), Bombardino (anche se quel nome non si pu√≤ sentire), Leon (forzatissimo con chameleon), Spike, Barryl, Mortis (vampiro, quindi morto), Corvo (originalissimo) e Nita (che forse in qualche lingua tipo indiano o cose cos√¨ significa orso, comunque non √® la prima volta che sento questo nome associato a un orso). Tara e Bo mi ricordano qualcosa ma non sono ancora riuscito ad associare, se hai qualche suggerimento √® il benvenuto! Comunque sono d'accordo, con certi nomi si potrebbe fare di pi√π, ma dubito che cambieranno, per non creare confusione tra giocatori... Poi, sinceramente, anche in Clash of Clans lo stregone per me √® sempre stato il mago.
---
That pam tho
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
You aren‚Äôt special 
---
Explanation: in the update, attacks and supers no longer leave one space gaps because they are hard to walk through with the joystick. Therefore, if your attack breaks a skull and leaves a one block gap, either another skull or a block will be destroyed, but you cannot consistently get it to break the block, as it randomly selects one to break.
---
Wow.  I thought having 15/22 in 3500 was a nightmare having all rares and super rares and a Pam for an epic I kinda lost hope for brawl boxes and instead spend my gems for skins or tickets instead 
---
I downloaded it still happens hope they have a fix soon 
---
He is so big when we see him in full model. But in any match.. he looks so small compared to other brawlers...
---
I agree 100%! This should be fixed..
---
I feel like the only reason this meme is getting upvotes is because the speling for fourth is wrong
---
Good, Its good Idea! Im love
---
Resets healing tho. What‚Äôs the point, makes him a little OP
---
Ok, thanks :)
---
just got a penny, currently at 3.5k a week later lmao.
---
Bo doesn‚Äôt have a remodel. Literally pointless to give him one without a remodel
---
Couldn‚Äôt change the title but, I meant to say the bots in friendly mode are level 1 (for some reason), and the brawlers the players are using are all their current level
---
Huh. Sorry about that, thanks. I didn't know.
---
Amazing! Really neat! I want one! üôÇ
---
yo u got any ideas?
---
And iPad Air users. Too bad is still isn‚Äôt fully fixed yet
---
Downvoted all of u/FlavioInnocent 's stuff!
---
PS I love this map! Seems balanced, but I think the walls should be a bit shorter, or having tiny 2 tile passages for brawlers to pass. Or else throwers will be too strong.... 
---
I bet it‚Äôs karma for attempting to team
---
Ok this is hilarious
---
Cool time lapse!
---
lol!
---
She had uno, but since she doesn't have voice lines she couldn't actually say it, so she took the +2 penalty for it.
---
First comment!
---
Crow was my third and final legendary here, not first. My first was actually Spike.
---
Haha
---
Darryl: help me
---
Was it that good?
---
Darryl can kill stuff... 
---
i have 2 
---
CREATURES OF THE *NIGHT!*
---
1. It's OP's 3rd legendary brawler.
---
2. No, it has the same chances as the other two.
---
I'm on a list now, aren't I?
---
Luckyyyyy!! He seems amazing!!
---
Haha good work. Can‚Äôt tell ya how many times I‚Äôve backstabbed teamers to teach em‚Äô a lesson 
---
UNLIMITED POWAAAAAAAAA‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è
---
This makes me wanna destroy supercell office 
---
What‚Äôs your worst score as boss? Mine is 23 seconds 
---
Broken beyond BROKEN
---
I stand by my suggestion that the map shouldn‚Äôt have changed, just make it so the ball respawns when behind the goal for X amount of time 
---
What level is your Nita lmao? Max nita does over 1000 per hit so no more than six shots required.
---
Yay
---
Maybe a faster mortar speed, or a fourth/fifth coin bursting out after the shot hits.  Maybe even having the star power shoot a red bomb every fifth shot which will either always hit, or do a smaller effect of the current star power when it lands with 2 or 3 other bombs, but those are just some ideas.
---
Lmao totally avoidable if the dyna had hit 2/3 sticks
---
why is there even a trophy req for replays if i did good with a hero i don‚Äôt often play or just have low trophies with - i should be able to go back and watch it
---
I‚Äôd award you if I wasn‚Äôt completely broke .-.
---
Damn that's spawntrapping......... Wow it's fun
---
I've always wondered what it would be like to softlock a showdown match.
---
Lmao luck 100 u should have an option to choose
---
Rude people makes me sad too
---
Why are you blocking out their names? I thought that was only for when one is prone to hate
---
There's an app
---
You have NO idea how much I'm looking forward too it
---
Because Rico is over powered 
---
Congrats! Leon is in the shop ü•≥
---
We will probably do something in the future. Not sure what that something would be yet.
---
Plz stop ur making my blood vessels pop
---
Because they are testing out if the servers can handle it. If they released it all at once it could be really laggy
---
Look at my past posts.
---
Lmao. 
---
Please write that again
---
Yes, that's the answer.

I‚Äôm 10k bruh, I don‚Äôt team

Thia is so sad, Alexa play Despacito

Lol dumb. This is like getting mad at the lottery cuz you dint win
---
Yes, exactly! I‚Äôm a f2p try hard playing for 1 year, and I am still not able to see this? My frank was at 399 trophies. I wanted to see a replay, so I tried pushing 1 trophy. Ended up tilting him now
---
They need to add this! 
---
Autocorrect 
---
Wow i get the part where george shoots lenny... but who is colt? Curley?
---
I‚Äôll try that next time, thanks!
---
So it has colt in the title? Am I missing something ?
---
I played for 1 year and I still didn‚Äôt unlock it because of that trophy limit. Not fair...
---
U live in Vegas is or sumthin?

fake, everyone knows thats impossible!!!!

You better bull-LEAVE

20% is a bit much, hes still a weak assassin 
---
all maps have this size, my friend :)
---
lol It's a such a coincidence his name has innocent. It's like he's planning on going to trial 
---
Its not a 6v1, theres 6 spawn location for decoration, and so people can spawn randomly in this 6 spawn area.

I'm hoping for crow tomorrow üòÖ

Same mine too!

hahaha a potato takes better picture than my phone, but thanks. I'm gonna upload a scan soon.

Looks awesome bro

I think the real crime here is you are using light mode
---
Oof... Thanks for sharing. Really needed to look at Mortis during very late game meta.
---
But randoms actually are incapable
---
There are definitely things that can be fixed, and I'm seeing a lot, but when you draw a lot it just becomes intuitive to see become a lot more attentive and critical of drawings, especially your own.
---
And just because there are things that can be fixed, doesn't mean the drawing is bad or unfinished. 
---
Primo was first character I got -

Thankyou!

Yes

Well i need a MOB Barley who throws MOLOTOV

If you don‚Äôt like playing with random people, don‚Äôt.

About Rank 15. I dont see him often in enemy teams, but i use him coz everyone still underestimates him.

Cmon, it's about history tho...

I also invent brawlers, see my profile

This was recently discovered, I'm pretty sure a fix would be released asap.

Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeep

Yeah, I got 9th place, in the full clip (I shortened it when I posted) you could've seen the -6 trophies at the end

Colors look different? I don‚Äôt really know either tbh

Agree, Star Player should get some benefits too, maybe even adding a section in profile, counter for "Star Player"

My match was draw 27%

Can't wait for it already.   
---
These gameplay videos are coming out because people have modded the real application, and since supercell already announced they've released the hero in game, its just hidden to us, so people using it to their advantage and modding it. 
---
RIP
---
I was a lucky few that got Leon from a small box. 
---
Congrats my friend.
---
Tnt is in game, but not used in maps.
---
Only in tutorial
---
I did so too, I've used him myself, and got to say, he's not to op but he's a pretty good brawler, can't wait for him to be released for real
---
While u only have 11 karma in 6 days
---
Its all random, you just hope you might be the big one, perhaps playing solo ( like not in a team )
---
Lmao
---
y e s
---
Dang lucky, I don‚Äôt have either of them yet XD
---
When tara kills she should say "you picked the wrong card"
---
Not if his brawler trophies aren‚Äôt being reset. The hardest part would be pushing past 800. If he has top players helping him + his Nita isn‚Äôt being affected by season reset (because total trophies &lt;3000) then it would be easily attainable. 
---
Then give less trophies when lost.
---
No problem. Enjoy your new op legendary!
---
Brawl Ball is terrible now
---
Yeah man, just too eager.
---
T r u e 
---
Yep
---
Holy ,this skin remake is so real,such niiiiiiiiiiice work omg,I want this skin .
---
lmao dafuq are u saying. ‚Äú I just wanted people to have fun ‚Äú. this is Brawl Stars subreddit. No one wants to see this kid shit.
---
Then people will stop focusing on the objective and just go for star player. For example, bull almost always gets star player in heist, so people would be fighting for who gets to be bull while playing with friends.
---
What phone you got?
---
Very convincing argument
---
I don't think those should be hidden, if the bear can spot someone in grass, then this should also be allowed. Its tit for tat.
---
Android
---
150 is a lot at high level
---
I disagree with the auto aim changes. It does not need even more of a buff.
---
Go for the token doubler. It‚Äôs worth 10 boxes which is equivalent to a mega box.

Nah it would favor snipers too much

No

I think the star power shouldn‚Äôt have any disadvantages

---
Power cubes aren't that good of rewards tho. . . Skill can beat them any day, as long as you and yur opponent aren't shotgunners. And the 1 power cubes bonus for each 3 they have is in my opinion not enough farming boxes outs you at less of a risk to die and gets you the cube faster
---
make beauty and beast skin ;)
---
Ok, thanks for advice
---
Succ
---
ikr, wonder who made it though...
---
I agree, but you need to look bothways, if Nita is getting advantage of spotting Brawlers using her Bear, she should also be spotted via the bear.

Amazing job

Get the most blades onto the enemy

I feel like that‚Äôs a fair price to pay though for the extra heals

Here is the guide to have he perfect movement in Brawler Stars
---
That does absolutely nothing. Just makes you play once a day instead of every 12 hours which if you do then what do you have to complain about.
---
They should change it so when leon goes invisible at close range they will not see him for about 3 seconds. So he can have time to escape. But after that people still can see him
---
A TIP FOR LEON SUPER CHANGES 
---
They should make it so that when leon go invisible enemies will not see him for 3 sec

it was on accident
---
Aw, that‚Äôs so sweet. And no worries I won‚Äôt judge you, I have probably spent $70 on this game since I started at global. Still no legendaries for me lol, maybe I‚Äôll buy Leon after all.

i see the instagram normies have moved to reddit

No , I‚Äôm actually a beta player since week 4. I just don‚Äôt play piper and I‚Äôm trying to get her trophies up but I‚Äôm stuck playing with low trophy dipshits who don‚Äôt have common sense. I‚Äôm 6k trophies.

Full level up appear randomly in the shop, from my experience( if they didn't change it after global) there's no pattern which decide when you will get it and for who.
---
Little trick
---
They will appear only for brawler that can't level up, for example if you have lv 1 frank with 300/20 PowerPoints you won't get his full level up.
---
You can "manipulate" the shop with this, if you have 21 brawlers in a situation like my frank's example the shop can only give you a full level up for you 22th brawler.
---
Ya barley is good, his bottles are hard to avoid even bottle's speed is slow.
---
Max. Dinamike: *happy noises*
---
Idk why bear has over 10000 hpq
---
r/woosh
---
I'm at like the exact same amount of trophies as you 
---
Ofc, but i was jussayin that you shoukd take the lunar pack :))
---
And i responded
---
Very fake
---
Nice one
---
Good for ya
---
F
---
Completely agree. He needs a little balancing imo.
---
Well yeah frank is an easy one but 7 franks all with their super is not if you get hit by one of them it s game over.
---
Oh ok thanks
---
Gg
---
Yep. In high level trophies this guy is completely dominant.
---
I wasn't talking about 7, I was talking about 1.
---
And, you had many Power Cubes, which helped a lot.
---
–ó–¥–æ—Ä–æ–≤–∞.
---
Waht????
---
Lol I have mortis is trash needs buffs
---
LoL soo true
---
Very funny
---
He maybe paid over $1k to maximize all brawlers.
---
Autoaim-autoaim-autoaim-autoaim and you finish with AUTOAIM...
---
Since the last update 
---
Woosh
---
Thx 
---
Please I want to buy this
---
Or Lang sauce
---
pics are wrong way around btw
---
He aint thicc enough 
---
excactly what i thought. and in the kill feed instead of showing a revolver when you kill someone they can show when you kill someone with the ability it will show this.
---
he secretly bribed supercell to nerf mortis in brawl ball
---
Yep, because it is slightly angled. If it's intentional or not is another question.

I had this glitch while as penny too
---
lol
---
really cool idea and looks amazing
---
Lmao I can‚Äôt find it 
---
im interested too
---
I mean no other brawlers star power has disadvantages, so why should she? And like that many players maybe don‚Äôt want her lvl 10
---
My friend has  2 legendaries and he‚Äôs been playing for 3 months
---
wait what the ....
---
Hell know.
---
Better to spend money on the "fair" game. Encourages the dev to produce fair games instead of pay 2 win.
---
what a nub
---
Look, mum, I'm on Reddit!
---
LOL 
---
This is a joke right
---
I mean the only brawlers good for this are brawlers with well breaking supers or a max dynamike
---
tara skin will be better
---
EXTREMELY disappointing-ly, I got 3rd :(
---
Yeah but when the bot plays for me I just die
---
+3/4 ain‚Äôt bad
---
Can you stop reposting? ffs
---
More like 2 birds 5 stones
---
It's only a fanart, not something I want Supercell to add in the game. 
---
i think its better now cuz now u have a chance to score even if they put the ball in the water cuz will get out but before if they put the ball behind the goal u had like 5% chance to score....
---
oh fuck i didnt see it actually uploaded twice the two posts are mine you can check
---
I use darryl's super a lot in brawl ball
---
It decreases everytime you get a brawler and increason when you so not get a brawler ( Trophy Road brawlers do not affect it)
---
that looks like something from power rangers XDD but its cool idea
---
Jessie&gt;penny
---
Nice work man! Do you use some controller?
---
contact support maybe?
---
150 takes about 8-6 hours at my level 
---
its happen to me alot but i think its a glitch

I got it for free and others
---
:p i saved alot of money
---
Yeah just walk outside into the full health Bo who has 4 power cubes while you‚Äôre trying to heal that‚Äôs clearly the big brain play here. 
---
Once I saw a dynamike in a bush ( I was bull) the dynamike was cornered so I knew I could kill him but right before I got to him, another bull inside the bush with dynamike killed me, and the s when I found out what a good strategy that is
---
Crow is the worst brawler in the current meta right now. All these other brawlers getting a buff when crow gets none makes him very weak. To answer the question, spike is undoubtedly better (This isn't biased since I love crow).
---
I'm worried for him
---
Yea I‚Äôm not proud of it either.
---
Hmm cool!!
---
so true
---
I do. OG brawl 
---
It‚Äôs summer in Australia 
---
Once you get to 4K trophies this happens I‚Äôm pretty sure.
---
Hehe 
---
Mortis going sicko mode
---
It's not a glitch if he get close to his dynimite he jumps up in the air. People do it all the time. You can tell it's not a glitch cause there's an animation for it 
---
L√©on also means Lion in Spanish but that doesn't really make sense since he's a chameleon 
---
Your better off just buying value packs which leads to faster progression so you get all brawlers faster. 
---
lol, but it's difficult to perform that strategy in solo, I'll use it for duo and look if it goes well
---
Those are buns not dumplings. 
---
A common mistake 
---
Ah vero vero! Per Bo mi immaginavo qualcosa di pi√π esotico, per√≤ in effetti bow si pronuncia proprio bo.
---
Better than jessie or bull?
---
How long did this take u? Hours I going with
---
nice, thanks for 100 uovotes üôè 
---
Can people just stop posting this shit? 
---
Repost and repost and repost
---
Threesome ship
---
Agree with you you can‚Äôt get anything good when f2p lol. I have all rares 2 super rares no epics/mythics/legends rise like rip. But I am 1.9k trophies in 6 days still you can beat a lot of people who are power 7 at power 3/4 like me
---
Nice. 
---
Your post has been removed, make sure to use the body of a post to elaborate on the title.

You should probably stop teaming with thrower üòÇ

"i Am NOt a bOT"

Thanks.
---
This has been posted 100 times, stop
---
Oh whoops, I looked for a while but couldn‚Äôt find one so I thought it wouldn‚Äôt be a repost
---
Stop. This has been posted at least 50 times before
---
Wait what i posted about the same guy lmao
---
no actually, only his star power kills stuff
---
That's a lot of chests.
---
I feel this.
---
Cool, pretty clutch win considering Mortis‚Äô strength in meta right now
---
6k is pretty low tbh have every brawler except legendaries to 500 (9.5k) no legendary
---
I have 5100 and have only Tara
---
I was so confused in-game and had to rewatch the replay a few times before realizing what could‚Äôve had happened:
---
  
---
Poco and Penny shot at the same time, but it‚Äôs hard to see Penny‚Äôs bullet. Both hit me and the turret at the same time too, but I was apparently slightly in front of the turret, which received splash damage from the coins and ended up getting destroyed immediately.  
---
At first I thought it was a bug, but while it still looks like it, it was just an unlucky combination of moves.
---
Nice win 
---
I would pay for a skin where you can see Tara's face
---
Op
---
I did 3.4 with giant jessie , ohhh boy aooo fun , and i spent 20 tickets  üòéüòéüòé
---
Unfortunatley thats rico not thicco
---
He is still OP
---
AFter like 20 nerfs, leon is still the best brawler in he game
---
Replace the No Hat Mortis with this
---
Was torn between Crow's phoenix skin and Leon.. I bought Leon.. Now I.m saving all my gems for that skin
---
The why are you running got me
---
CANCER
---
Thanks
---
Sadly, yeah :(
---
How much would this skin cost?
---
Oh ya
---
3 piles of coins do the most damage
---
N‚Äôimporte quoi... Je suis s√ªr que tu l‚Äôutilises comme Bull, comme un tank. Il est abusif Corbac tu sais juste pas le jouer.
---
Bullshit... I‚Äôm sure you use him like Bull, like a tank. He‚Äôs OP, you just don‚Äôt know how to use him.
---
he trying to help he community,like dam
---
That's shit man
---
Because I neva dieeeee
---
Wow so lucky üòå How many total trophies do u have if u don‚Äôt mind me asking? 
---
Ok I‚Äôll admit this is nice. But not as a 5th skin
---
Thing is no matter how well you play Crow, in a final showdown against Bull Shelly or Pam you lose 
---
lol I want to see Tara's face too
---
Nahh, I think you meant trillions. That would make more sense 
---
I agree, he's a bit under powered
---
Hehe, Thank you!
---
Supercell: Oh we are so sorry we fix that 
---
Next Game..

1 trophie

30 Trophies

40 Trophies

500 Trophies

700 Trophies 
---
800 Trophies

Thanks!
---
Waaa, WANT üíúüíú
---
Nice! You should do more nita drawings you know just saying
---
Not easy to do when 3 are teaming. 
---
Can‚Äôt we change it to ‚Äòwhen penny‚Äôs snot hits a friendly brawler it splits‚Äô 
---
Never play with randoms. 
---
Do you make commissions of these?
---
Know what...
---
What is the website to create these maps
---
EHHHHHHH what's up doc?
---
this is why you DONT play this game
---
aa? It doesnt include bull amd darryl because they are not in 3 Shot or 3 Shot and Super category
---
That‚Äôs the point. I don‚Äôt have a brawler with 400 trophies 
---
Oh. Okay
---
&gt;I'm sorry for that, I'm new to Reddit and I did not know anyone else had put this idea
---
Well, where did you get this picture from, then?
---
Sakura it's def a fine skin.. but its too girly 
---
Will supercell fix it or no?
---
Rico
---
Nice! What do you think about leon? 
---
Wow nice texture pack 
---
Oof I hope you get your legendary soon!! ;v; I‚Äôm trying to pull Spike haha
---
What
---
Haha good idea... But the copyright would attack Supercell like a lightning xD
---
This is why i never break bones
---
I don't understand your logic right now. Give at least one reason why she should be nerfed
---
He must suck if he had the highest trophies but died first.
---
It was a joke...

Really ?? You didnt see the 29 February written there ?? *Sigh*

We all have demons

OwO

But sometimes...

DO it. spend the rest on token toublers after leon though

Exactly

Nice one dude
---
The only friend Stormy Plains has is dynamike teams
---
Frank Slayer
---
Bull: hehe
---
Shelly with ult: hehehehehehe
---
For real tho, Jessie and Penny are both kinda OP in different ways
---
Hey is frank good in Rockwall Brawl
---
This is a high %,hopefully soon ma man!
---
get better wifi
---
fun for 1 out of 6 players 
---
yah
---
I agree with most of what you write, but‚Ä¶
---
\&gt; Make an mmr that actually makes it difficult to climb. I‚Äôm in 6000 trophies
---
Well, just get above 15k and come back, will you?
---
So it's a wifi problem u say? But I thought wifi doesn't affect fps
---
I love this idea. This has to be added
---
Dumbass
---
I'm at 7000 and do not have a single star power, om it's on i do not mind it, but i get matched against enemies with star power, but teammates without. 
---
Maybe...
---
Thank you!! :D I want spike he‚Äôs my favorite brawler 
---
Yeah I'd say so. Just make sure you charge your special early then try and hold center of the map for good chance at winning.

That guy in the pic did it twice though, one of which he had the ball for 20 seconds then just walked into our own goal randomly

How to download

I included the link..

OK sorry

I‚Äôm just talking about generally. Like some people may accidentally do it, which could get them locked from the game mode

There‚Äôs a link in the comments..

THIEF !!!
---
Where is the link? 
---
I don‚Äôt mean leaderboard players I mean like 10k+. Supercell said it themselves that we are in the top 100%
---
Ive started playing Like 11 days ago and im allready at 4 k. I havent got alot of time or i would be further, almost every round i win i am Starplayer. 1 o 1 me naked in Real Life
---
No 
---
Better watch out Mortis!
---
I don't know how to add another imagine.
---
I think penny she has more distance and she is probably the most annoying to deal with plus she does more damage
---
Hm oke
---
Know also makes sense in that sentence anyway.
---
Did you just say Penny is underpowered lmao
---
Thief, you stole this map 
---
yo i do agree with this that is true, i just feel like when i play maxed players it‚Äôs much more challenging to win because of their much more advantageous star powers.
---
the same situation at 7600
---
Stop copying other peoples posts, that‚Äôs all you do 
---
i hope it is a glitch or they will add a sound effect for it it‚Äôs so weird without it
---
Huh? He just forgot one word that‚Äôs not r/engrish 
---
Removed - You have a negative karma score, please fix this before posting again. This action is to prevent spam on the subreddit.
---
Yeah, she is definitely a bit easier. Still hard to kill below the threshold, but since they removed the gaps in the corners, Jessie can no longer just camp there.
---
Just curious how you guys feel about dynamikes star power. He rides the blasts from his explosives. It‚Äôs nice in some situations, and incredibly annoying in others. Not quite as disadvantageous as Nita‚Äôs but still.
---
Was the link deleted by mod or something
---
Lol look who he is against üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Stop STEALING you low life 
---
that‚Äôs already what i kinda use it for is to control small areas with a land mine kinda thing
---
SORRY FOR THE CONFUSION, I will make a new post with the link. 
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure the contents are only loaded once you get a brawl box ready to open (ie. after tapping the icon in the menu, but before you see the contents.) I saved up boxes before Leon‚Äôs release, and ended up unlocking him from those boxes, so it‚Äôs pretty certain that you can get Gene from a saved up box.
---
I Would love to see the shoot go to 3 after shooting the mortar  
---
Imagine someone trying to hit you and you put the mortar and shooting through and the mortar get some health back just like jessie  
---
It deal massive damage 
---
Mortis* not Frank.
---
"This candy sucks, Supercell pls i need new candy to eat"
---
STOP IT
---
Also I‚Äôm saying many top players have played for over a year now, and still are missing legendarys. It‚Äôs not jealousy, it‚Äôs a broken progression system. I have a mini account at 5.5k and I JUST pulled poco on it meanwhile you are around the same level and have all the brawlers except crow
---
Yes finally i waited for like 2 mins xd
---
You can see peple, when they are healing
---
I hope Supercell fixes this with the amount of these types of blogs being posted
---
Leave it like that it generates boxes /s
---
Only 90‚Äôs kids will remember this üòÇ Darryll pre-global release. 
---
Yes and shelly and bull need a hard nerf, i would say healt range and damge nerf BOTH SHELLY AND BULL, i cant push my trophie because there are tanks all around wating to kill me because and its too overpowered if they dont nerf bull and shelly soon IM QUITTING THE GAME and im dead ass serious...
---
They should also make Frank's super last longer for the boss because c'mon, he gets stunned for like 0.01 second!
---
Supercell also stated 10k players are in the top 1%
---
FOOTbull 
---
Some people don‚Äôt want to jump as Dynamike, as if they are being chased he can‚Äôt put tnt at his feet without jumping.
---
The desc for the sub says "Fuck ups in english of any kind"
---
in my case, the problem is missclicks ;-;
---
this could help me 
---
oh i was forgetting, i don't speak English so... pls patience üò•üôè
---
If you think that's good you need to know how to suck karma buddy
---
Oh no...  I have Chief Pat disease.
---
Btw you need to lern where to place her mortar amd penny is acctualy realy good brawler you just gotta learn how to play her, you know dont use autoaim is the most important part
---
They‚Äôre pool balls
---
His account was made a day ago?
---
These heros are fine
---
If you get that close to them you deserve to die
---
Not Supercells fault you would rather conplain that get good
---
Why you spam it? 
---
Yes and I had a lot of control but the f....... randoms..
---
Lol what a bunch of tools

Oh. My. God.

There‚Äôs an app called ‚Äúbrawl stars map maker‚Äù at the google play store.

Hahaha i wooooosh u haha
---
My turn to post this next month!
---
The struggle was real
---
Are you mentally backwards accelerated?
---
I‚Äôve been playing brawl ever since the first few hours it released back in June. I existed in this place for a long time.
---
r/itswooooshwith4os 
---
Cute girls
---
Heh, I‚Äôm soo hyped to go from 10k to 10500 trophies to get useless coins that I won‚Äôt need anymore in my life.
---
BECAUSE ALL OF MY BOXES GIVE ME 50+ COINS INSTEAD OF LEON, SPIKE, OR CROW!
---
Kids on voicechat always say "I sleep with your mom"
---
10/10 Would Bull .... errr I mean Brawl
---
Good shitpost
---
Yes yes yes
---
I wanted to play a lot, but my class schedule prevents me from doing it, and my transport is long, during the week, I do not have enough time to play. 
---
Have fun
---
All healing is reduced as big brawler, not a bug
---
Downvote, since the last parch the ball does more damage than a bullet
---
r/Lootstarz
---
Save the Mega for when Gene comes out! :d
---
Stolen map, plus it's not very good, only 1 entrance to the center. Barley would be op because there is only 1 choke point.
---
It's very rare. An average person will open like 300 brawl boxes before getting a legendary. 
---
For future reference, save tickets for robo rumble. It is by far the best event to spend tickets on.
---
Well does that mean everyone at around 300 trophies is a noob? Because seeing them tanks too much at that trophy range...
---
I agree the quakes looked better
---
Of course Bull and Shelly are overpowered. I ranked them both up to 20 with 3 hours for each. Took me 3 weeks to get Penny to 400. THREE WEEKS. 
---
What the fuck? Somebody‚Äôs getting a little cocky, huh?
---
To see how it effects the servers etc. They will lower teh requirements later
---
Tanks aren't OP, they are barely good at some gamemodes. If you think they are strong, it is because you are at low trophies
---
Teaming should be prohibited in solo showdown...
---
That's why it's called **SOLO**
---
Damn that‚Äôs a big RIP. The only character I had to ‚Äúbuy‚Äù was Tara and it was right after they changed the Elixirs for Power Points and they converted all the elixirs and I had like 600 gems in exchange. Legendaries were also harder to get. No one under 7,000-8,000 trophies had a legendary back then only Max Accounts and top players. I got my first legendary like 1 year into playing the game at 8,000 trophies. Also it was way harder to push back them. Once you got to 500 it would be 4 trophies win / 6 trophies lost. And after 600 it was 3 trophies win / 7 trophies lost. Now it‚Äôs always 5 if you win so they made it easier to push high. 
---
Yea, it‚Äôs obviously  a friendly game
---
Oh sorry
---
Then it's nice 
---
It‚Äôs obviously a friendly game. This would never happen
---
Yeah you have to practice it then his star power is useful in most situations except in solo showdown a the end. This thing with nita is annoying the whole time...
---
How should I know, he's only lv 10
---
Kid, they are easy to use, not OP. Maybe that's why you don't know how to rank up Penny, she actually recquires skill. Keep crying as they won't be nerfed
---
What about cavern churn in end game lol
---
score! thank you!
---
Haha but also there are some ridiculous rewards
---
This is the only map that really excites me with Showdown.
---
#Minecraftevilbunny
---
Stop spam plz
---
Even players above 11k use auto aim close range. I don‚Äôt think many people would find value with this.
---
Great idea. Some hidden stats for each individual brawler should also be in a see-more part of their character page. Right now it's just a brief description, like "***Colt spins his chambers, rattling off a massive burst of bullets that will shred through almost anything.***" However, we aren't told told a lot of things, like how long is Colt's reload speed. How long is Frank's stun. Movement speed for each brawler and what the number means. It would be nice to have.
---
Ik its quite cringy isnt it
---
If you buy the offer, he will be new for you. That's what they mean
---
It happens. If he‚Äôs above 500 it‚Äôs more than likely that 9 people teamed.  
---
Dude im almost at 7k all my brawlers are above 15 rank at least, im saying that in showdown everyone is playing them and thats why is feels like they are op, and the main thing is they steal your powerups every time and then you can do anything agains 16 bulls running around with a ton of powerups trying to kill that guy with 0
---
gotta hate these people...
---
They should bring it back to the og pinhole punt lol
---
Ok we all know all you do is steal, you may think your reposting, but you need to give credit to the original post. So don't take this as hate. Take it as you better stop stealing or you'll get negative karma. Right now you only have one so you better be careful.
---
''kid'', ''keep crying'', ''actually requires skill''
---
Not sure If actually an adult playing this game or some pumped-up nerd.
---
Your text is more cringy than your actual opinion, jokes aside. 
---
What is mobail fon??????
---
Not because they are used at low trophies they are OP. They have a low skill cap, that's the reason. Also, balancing is not made according to just SD
---
It‚Äôs smart to have a brawler at level 9. But maybe since you‚Äôre f2p, start with your favorite heros. The ones most worth it. Brock does have a good star power though. For showdown esp.
---
Yeahh true, especially with the el primo exploit. Worth holding onto tickets just for that one I guess, I just wanted to open some boxes.
---
Thank You!
---
Or 6k
---
Once is enough buddy
---
Yeah, whatever you say, kid. You are the best player, you are right, they need a nerf, amazing, thanks for fixing the game
---
That's sad
---
I have 12k trophies and it takes me a week and a half just to be rewarded with 200 gold. Not to mention I already have 7000 gold.
---
Well killing an idiot walking in a straight line isn't right?
---
Maybe reclaim for all the ones they buffed (if they buff it). Otherwise I'd be a little salty getting 25 gold while someone gets like 150 or something. 
---
I‚Äôm talking about showdown and no, in current meta she is not even close to the easiest brawler to 500
---
beautiful 
---
Noo Frank's
---
I just hate this game...why am I even playing...
---
Cute!&gt;:3
---
Yayyy:D
---
Lovely 
---
Idea:
---
Reduce the cannon ball's dmg by 10%
---
Her starpower increases the cannon ball's hitbox by 5%, making it harder to dodge but dealing less dmg
---

---
I thought this was intended, and this happens to any character who is healing. There was an El Primo who was healing and trying to sneak up on us in the bush but I saw him healing and it gave it off right away.
---
Make his star power that posion stacks
---
he‚Äôs having a hard day
---
If you can't kill a crow with Darryl you're playing him incredibly wrong. 
---
5
---
1 if your brawlers are low level. 2 if high
---
2 fucking coins üëåüëåüëå
---
Than-kewüòâ
---
Only difference being bull requires 0 skill while Darryl is one of the hardest brawlers to master. 
---
But if you have all powerpoints for the brawlers you have you only get one draw of coins (more than when you get powerpoints aswell)
---
D
---
Yea a friend of mine started playing in late dec and is at 6k
---
Describing noob in one pic
---
BRINGER OF DEATH
---
Didn't know that, they probably should pump the delay!
---
My High Level brawler ist Primo with Level 4 xD Thanks i buy the 1 
---
That's not how you play bull! There are teamers in showdown that bull stands no chance against. Good luck pushing to 500 without using Bull in heist. This is coming from a 13k, and Bull is the worst brawler in showdown currently.
---
He‚Äôs got a cool design and a cool new voice. Buuut, I struggled to get 500 with him. I‚Äôm great with other brawlers. So I‚Äôll just leave him on the shelf with Darryl, Colt, Shelly, and Jessie. Lol. 
---
Nice ideas
---
really good but more bush and walls i think
---
I do like the sound though. I sometimes use Green Spike just for the sound. 
---
Uses Colt super to open both sides (Colt seems good here. So both teams would have Colt, 
---
Grass doesn't regrow, so bull and Colt. 
---
Sneakiness will be gone once we get our super.
---
No he has four check if you don't believe me
---
You cant join a big brawler match with friends.
---
And then u buy the Pack Nr 2 as well
---
I'm dry üôÄ
---
I have almost all power 8 characters and have been saving chests for a week now... And just used 2 months worth tickets (never bought tickets)
---
Jajaja, very rare but funny , how are you,  Yacine?
---
LOL
---
I do that also ü§≠
---
Yeah you won't need much gold if your brawlers are like that. The boxes should give enough 
---
Soo true
---
Yes. I‚Äôve even seen gameplay of the hover board dude. He‚Äôs going to RETIRE Mike and Bobby-Barley the drunkard. Lol. 
---
Animal sounds cool too. My guess is Hover Dude is epic and Animal is super rare. Just my guess. 
---
Yeah 
---
Dude i have no idea ,they were all getting destroied with the turret and bounces , all lvl 7 and 8
---
XD 1 or 2 
---
Yeah Number 3 
---
Yes I do have to agree with that maybe a rework would be fine but something too strong would be unbalanced. I liked the idea of being able to shoot her cannon would make it launch a double or make her shot spread out at an enemy trying to destroy the mortar. 
---
How do you know? All we can see from her body is an eye.
---
Spike was the best brawler before Leon was released. Let‚Äôs see how he fares in different modes-
---
Gem Grab- Excellent
---
Showdown- Excellent 
---
Duo Showdown- Outstanding 
---
Brawl Ball- Excellent 
---
Heist- Excellent 
---
Bounty- Very Good 
---
Omg!
---
Spike is too good :/

Yea xD but you gotta do that with Leon at close range

it is :(

Thanks :)

My main account has 5k trophies and i have 2 alt accounts
---
First one has 2 Epics with 2k trophy
---
Second one got Piper at 950 trophies 
---
And my main account has 1 Epic and 1 Mythic at 5k trophies ;-;
---
F my friend
---
The intention is for a map more for long distance shooters so it has few bushes and walls.
---
"E"
---
Just asking.. how much trophy do you have ?
---
She already can control areas. People either run away from mortar fire or come to destroy the mortar that‚Äôs when penny pops out and has fun. I do believe her star power could be something like being able to shoot her cannon doing that out wards burst damage to anyone coming near the mortar. Or something similar 
---
\*mortis after his hat got removed\*
---
Indeed 
---
She doesn‚Äôt need a nerf at all. I think shes in a solid spot rn. People just get upset when they dont have a brawler and yell for nerfs 
---
It‚Äôs not just you. I‚Äôm on the latest OS on an iPhone XS, girlfriend on an X, and we‚Äôve both been crashing every few games after maybe an hour of play. 
---
Don‚Äôt have a reason for you though, sorry. Hope it‚Äôs patched soon. 
---
Me: Playing solo to dodge this problem and still loose anyway because the trash was inside you all along

1000 gold is awesome! After 10.000 Trophies i only need more gold!!

Just because CR costs $20k to max out doesn't mean $1k to max out in Brawl Stars isn't bad, it's fucking ridiculous. Keep in mind both of these are *mobile* games.

That happened to me but the other team scored on themself

Darryl/Dynamike has left the chat

If Jessie gets a nerf in big game, Bull and Shelly deserves a nerd on Showdown too.
---
Big boxes suck
---
Thank you bro! 
---
It‚Äôs just to show lol it was a friendly game
---
Nah, people would change their names all the time then...
---
didnt understand it?
---
He‚Äôs good at the game
---
U noobs he has same plastic surgeon as Popeye... Ya'll be jelous u cant afford big forearm jugs.
---
He‚Äôs the most fun one tho
---
But it would work perfectly fine without the silhouette. When viewing a skin there could be 2 models behind it...

Took me while to understand the image. Geez I thought losing 100 trophies in one hour with bull is bad no offense...

It‚Äôs a Of Mice and Men reference. Lennie was a really big dude who was mentally handicapped that kept hurting/killing people by accident without knowing it (Bc he didn‚Äôt have the mental capacity to understand his actions) and his friend had to put him down. It‚Äôs a pretty good book
---
yep man i have 65k unused gold.....
---
Yah but you were also trying to team, so youre all dirty
---
No he doesn‚Äôt, he‚Äôs OP now with this recent update, just get good at playing him 
---
They have what they deserve
---
If you play against one, yeah üòÇ
---
i think Feb 14th, if not very soon after
---
Doesn't his super have unlimited range though? 
---
This started as a simple 2 person team for me, though it eventually evolved into this and I had to go with it if I wantwd to survive
---
It does but you can still bear beat them. The highest I have is a 6 like only 300-400 max though on all my chars. I notice more 9s and 10s at 350. It's hard for me to pass 450-500 unless I'm carried by people I know lol. 
---
But there's ppl with only lv 5s all Champs 500 trophy each 
---
Thanks for the feedback, my name is glory - brawl Stars on yt 
---
Link? Thats not very helpful.
---
I also liked Rico's old figure, not to fat shame Rico lmao but I liked him when he was skinny
---
*Have much fear, Mortis is here!*
---
C'mon do it
---
Just nerf that his super cannot recharge again his super
---
That's not how it works
---
crashing seems to be the main problem here, mobile data wont work
---
I really like the details and stuff! That must've took you hours!
---
If you are on mobile, click on your name and select "change user flair". 
---
I‚Äôm not teaming in sd at all, I wanted only to get closer to them
---
She's among the best brawler in the game, by far the best carrier on gem grab.
---
Not only she can tank better than a bull, she can also zone out enemies with huge barrage of bullets that heals her, deals an absurd amount of damage and close range, and her turret can make your team unkillable
---
I‚Äôve been playing before global and I haven‚Äôt reached a mythic but when I introduced my friend to the game his first week he had a legendary and 2 mythics. He prolly paid, but it hurts
---
But you were one of the teamers, how do you even fell proud about your first place when all the other dynamikes did the work for you?
---
why? :0
---
Mike‚Äôs starpower has a really minor disadvantage. If you cause yourself to jump accidentally, you can‚Äôt shoot or control yourself, briefly. While it‚Äôs not as bad as this Nita thing, it can still be a minor inconvenience for close range combat.
---
The letter after the letter after E
---
Maybe the Jessie player laged but didn't disconnect 
---
True yeah
---
Brock is the Camilla(FEH) of Brawl Stars
---
Hi
---
749 trophies on Shelly, yet his Barley is, like, 3 matches negative at 34 trophies. 
---
Excuse me just try to hide in a bush, just try pushing your bull. Play him in Double Trouble and we'll see who's laughing when you actually reach high trophies.
---
When Lunar pack gets off sale Gene will be released
---
I got Penny from a big box
---
~~Calling Sparky a "trash can on wheels" hurts her feelings.~~

Calling Darryl a "flying trash can" hurts his feelings.
---
Ricochet
---
Oh, no mean to offend you, nvm. You're one of the backstabbers. Nice.
---
Ikr, it's all they can do, no skill
---
I got my leon from a small box lol 
---
Bold of you to assume that i know how to do that
---
More like every player's nightmare
---
Jk. 
---
well, agree...in my case I play a lot with mortis, and quick fire sometimes disturbs me, but it's true this would not be useful for many people
---
They should have nerfed his range instead of his damage 
---
He has long range+ damage with his main cactus + area control with his spikes. He needs a nerf desperately 
---
They should at least stop giving gold and give gems instead
---
Yea for mortis and the throwers they should do something different maybe.
---
RemindMe! 3 hours
---
except for appearance. it looks rather nice
---
can‚Äôt beat them. join them. then backstab. 
---
Respect
---
Man this is so true. Worst thing is that it takes 2 days and a half to get one of these, just to get 10 power points for three brawlers (or even just two) and eventually one or two tickets and three gems. 
---
They really should upgrade the rewards of these boxes or at least make them faster to get.
---
NO SWEARING!
---
It ain‚Äôt pay to win the top shelly is level 6 and has 1000 trophies on one brawler 
---
Downvoted AGAIN
---
Matchmaking is based on trophies not power level. 
---
They probably couldn't completely polish his 3D model so it has marks like that on it.
---
Ok, lol
---
but then strong teams will annihilate weak teams every single time tho
---
So far you have 94 Leons to post.
---
When you don‚Äôt have friends...
---
I GOT BROTHERS
---
It‚Äôs just not fun. Pretty much ever other ‚Äúbattle royale‚Äù style game bans this hardcore... because it toxic and cheap 
---
How is it over 1 xd
---
That‚Äôs crazy it should only take a few weeks to get a legendary now!
---
Betrayals 
---
It amazes me that the devs are split on this issue. Solo showdown is named "solo" for a reason. 
---
Teaming completely ruins the point of solo showdown and is really demotivates players to push trophies. #BanTeamingNow
---
Actually tho. 
---
Don‚Äôt listen to light seraph, mega boxes have 10x more chance of getting a legendary, it says so!
---
Epic fail
---
I just checked and I'm very wrong lol. When he was first announced I swear I read somewhere saying his range on his super was unlimited. Now I'm just reading it has great range.
---
Go into the shop and tap on the big box, then tap on the icon in the corner
---
It will tell you your chance of getting each brawler 
---
Me too pls?
---
I'd say between 50-80 gems would be fair for a name change.
---
Same here they are all at like 2k trophies while I‚Äôm over 10k. Sometimes I‚Äôll carry them in gem grab or duos but it‚Äôs too hard to be worth it
---
I call bullshit or you wouldn‚Äôt be pm‚Äôing it to people.
---
Ye I wish I would had chose another brawler cuz Leons somehow never seem to die...
---
Ok 
---
Wtf...?
---
 just in the final 2 
---
I CHANGED IT TO BIG CHUNGUS HELP
---
If they have everyone maxed out then any reward would be a shit reward tho
---
Primo Pu-
---
in the final two, its almost always a strong team versus a weak team. Plus if you got second, what are you trying to fix? you still got a positive amount of trophies
---
The bullets in game are actually nerf bullets
---
Learning from youtubers like coach Cory has helped me. Also know which brawlers to use on each map. Some just aren‚Äôt suited for certain modes/maps. 
---
And then bull,shelly,darryl &amp; el primo :v
---
Agreed. Let‚Äôs hold them accountable and improve everyone‚Äôs experience. Cmon supercell 
---
Me aswell plz 
---
LMAOOOO,that spike got YEETED on
---
Ok thx man! 
---
Yep. We get one after 3 days if we collect every Star Token everyday, but it's just not worth.
---
Equip it in the flair section 
---
This map screams Piper
---
Why would it be patched it's not a cheat it's just an intentionally added Easter Egg?
---
 very good but to make it more realistic, make him thicc
---
I think that people forgot this game was meant for fun and not just trophy push to max out your account, I mean I still have 18 brawlers at 8.8k trophies and still no Tara or Legendaries.
---
Most underrated comment 
---
Tried to place some bushes near hideouts. Any tips on balancing?
---
Bruh friendly game
---
I don't Brawl Ball is broken or bad right now. But I agree with the other stuff.
---
That's how Jessie works 
---
Nice, man. I was around your trophy count when I got my second legendary. I‚Äôm still missing my third, lol.
---
This some good sht
---
N U T
---
Just as Clash Royale did...
---
WAIT THERE‚ÄôS REPLAYS???
---
Succede
---
I beat kieth
---
Better write on last;
---
Technology wins...  -Jessie
---
For sure. Honestly i started playing showdown to ‚Äúpush trophies‚Äù but it got old and I often just get found and killed. Now I‚Äôm super aggressive and have pushed really far... far enough into the teaming range of trophies I guess. It‚Äôs made me a better player as well. 
---
Upvote for the use of a TCW screengrab.
---
She shots a skull
---
The "but it's just for fun" argument is irrelevant. Just because you play for fun doesn't mean others aren't trying to grind trophies. Teaming defeats the entire purpose of a "solo" showdown and should have never been allowed in the first place. 
---
Why? You‚Äôre more likely to win if you‚Äôre not the boss.
---
i only team with dynamikes when im playing dynamike because i find it funny to bombard people with a shit ton of dynamites.Also,u can always have trust in a dynamike
---
Yea and i have university entry exam this year guess i‚Äôll die
---
Dodge those dynamites
---
Well if they got boxes they could have a better chance to get future brawlers
---
I also play dynamite with which discredits your second statement
---
petition: stop all the petitons.
---
She's going to heaven! 
---
It‚Äôs a primo with 9 power cubes. So?
---
Ok thanks for the advice I posted a gene thumbnail if you want to look at it
---
This. I used to get home from work and play until I got all my tokens and go to sleep wicked tired. 
---
S k i p e

At least 430* 
---
Lifeless-CUZ BULL KILLS LIFE
---
This is gonna end up exactly like the ‚ÄòI‚Äôm gonna burn an RG‚Äô thing in r/clashroyale 
---
I have +7K trophies and only have 16 brawlers
---
sad...
---
It‚Äôs not but a sixteenth of a box might be
---
I was matching brawlers with 9xx trophies and close 600 trophies in almost every single game lol and all of them were 11k up total trophies and some were like 14k trophies 
---
Ahh, which brawlers are you missing?
---
You can get better at the game if you buy skins. I once was a Poor player with his little cute Nita at 300 trophies, the Christmas Nita Skin was for sale, i bought it and PAAM! Five hours later i was a Rich player with his little cute Nita at 500 trophies. #SkinToWin
---
r/subsithoughtifellfor
---
So why complain about 11k players? You‚Äôve almost mastered the game, it isn‚Äôt like you don‚Äôt have a shot to win.
---
Go check Coach Cory's new Youtube video, he explains everything.
---
I only have two epics
---
Paradise Garden
---
*Bull Paradise*
---
Yeah xd 
---
His bar(2500) matches perfectly with the reward level
---
Listen, if you don't deliver in 48 hours, we are deploying the downvotes
---
are you 100% sure its not your connections problem?
---
You got soo lucky you had every single one of those mushrooms 
---
Not enough bushes.
---
Wow. What's your chance of getting another epic?
---
Oh... Imma make a plan...
---
Yours crash? Really? Well, in my case, after the update, my game's lag was starting to decrease a lot, maps that usually are unplayable for my phone started being really decent.
---
LSD
---
Stop screwing around.
---
Are you sure? I get 20 tokens pretty often from a new event coming. Sometimes if your in a team also if they haven't opened the event then open it and switch to it you can get an extra 10
---
wait, that's illegal
---
Yeah, but what is wrong with getting a big box? 
---
But when i Play a brawler at a Long Time i will better and better and than 300 Trophies are yeah..easy peasy lemons squezzy xd
---
Nice win
---
You 100% positive you‚Äôre actually receiving the tokens? Look how many you have in your chest before you open and then even after it looks like the animation goes twice you really only receive 10.
---
Lol im on it
---
Why
---
Sadly I don't have a screenshot to prove but today it happened to me even 5 times in a row at 440 trophies with Shelly...
---
0.5472 epics
---
0.2496 mythics
---
0.1440 legendarys
---
What is it 
---
Thank you! This is a really useful advice!!
---
Nah they spin in the whole game and that two teams didn‚Äôt not attack each other 
---
Yes with and without pun
---
Why does everything have to be a petition 
---
Damn, you really do have bad luck man.
---
It got patched in clash royale after a few months
---
weird for me it just shows it maybe if you click this [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-Cq5M--nYQ&amp;feature=share)
---
Can‚Äòt you See it?
---
I guess it didn‚Äòt work
---
Some people have fun by playing competitively.
---
She gets it from her mom.
---
Finally hit 4500 without leon...
---
Mortis gang rise up
---
*healing mushrooms for dat win*
---
That would be a good idea but it‚Äôs sucks if half the people playing wants to be boss
---
No pic 
---
Lampers is definitely his name from now on
---
Nice edit!
---
Very good

Throwers might be a little too powerful, perhaps the middle gap could be about 3 or something tiles wide

What‚Äôs a good way to find teammates? Is there an official brawl stars discoed?
---
There are only 5 people in rawanda

üòÇ That Darryl got molested by those Franks. Gang violence 101.

taking the gems from the other team would be really difficult 
---
Didn't know this existed, thnx
---
Get rekt
---
So this is what randoms are doing during matches 
---
Lol. I got Leon from one yesterday. My odds were .1105
---
Hehe leon is invisible 
---
They should make it 8 so it only takes 2 days
---
F that; just join Clubs with a lot of members. People will usually Join, most want to climb haha 
---
Luck sent
---
Damn right i'm stuck at 200 cups w/him he's a real skill based character
---
Don't worry you'll get it soon just play and collect boxes! :D
---
I preferred it was nerfed
---
They did nerf his star power, and he is balanced, you just need to learn how to counter him
---
Oh. Well, I DID get 1 brawler to 400, but it tilted too 399 when the update came
---
Yeah, 100% garanteed, it can take less too.
---
My odds were 0.653!
---
Or make the zipper run all the way down the hoodie
---
Oh. Sorry üòñ
---
His super should be 3 wall breakers
---
100% agree with you
---
‚Äúhey guys look at me i have dynamike‚Äôs starpower‚Äù
---
Your friend can‚Äôt be in big game with you, the mode won‚Äôt let you play with a team
---
r/madlads
---
I‚Äôm at 7400 I hope they fix 11k by the time I get there 
---
No, I don't agree with this. Landing Frank's super isn't really all that easy. It has a huge wind up and many enemies will simply get out of the way. Not to mention in solo you'll get ganked by other players who try to take advantage not just of the stun but of the fact that you no longer have your super. Additionally Frank cant attack whole moving which makes attacking with him sort of high skill. Frank is powerful sure, but he lacks mobility. He might seem like an agro brawler at first but actual works super well as a support, keeping opponents at a distance. I think he's fine just the way he is.
---
Or change it to a chain. Make him more gangster
---
Nice fan art*
---
The servers are way too busy to focus on replays below 400, which are about 85% of the replays I believe, just as they fix the servers and lag they can focus on replays
---
Matchmaking is based on brawler trophies.
---
Check on youtube, they are two of the most followed brawl stars youtuber
---
If you got money and play this game a decent amount... Why not 
---
Damn that‚Äôs high. How many other mythical and epics do you have?
---
Then it would be gone. I lose those things instantly

Stat power?
---
Agreed. Old Brawl Ball was terrible. New Brawl ball is terrible. Brawl Ball is just terrible in general. 
---
Do you think he‚Äôs balanced?
---
Frank is one of the most balanced brawlers in the whole game, not too meta, but still good enough top players can and actually play him above 700, he is not op, you just need to know how and when to counter him, if you rush in as a low life brawler of course you are gonna get crushed, just as with Bull, Shelly, El Primo and many others
---
Wow you're only the 76,158th person to post that on this subreddit

I‚Äôm sorry what? What the hell does phishing have to do with teaming?
