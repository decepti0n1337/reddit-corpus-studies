Kind of. But not really. If you see at the last frank shot. He predicted Where I'm going to dash by shooting At the back. And he is a 500 frank so. He ain't bad!
---
Well....this was an interesting read!

the mortis gang grows stronger by the day
---
Omg your so smart nice idea
---
Never Underestimate Dynamike
---
333 now
---
YOU WERE TEAMING?!
---
It is a glitch that can be used in friendly matches to give one brawlers star power to another brawler.
---
Yeah As well as Your spinning gang. As well as you got a new member named tick.
---
Spike is going to die
---
SS No Legendary
---
Brawl stars memes be like :D
---
oh please i got to 400 trophies with dynamike without spinning
---
Noice
---
Amazing kill, but I hate when people spin after killing someone
---
Then which do you prefer
---
tyler1 will never fail to crack me up
---
spinning is for the weak
---
Most top competitors rank her as one of the worst. She's only good at defending against tanks and most tanks have fallen out of the meta.
---
S U G O I
---
I which I could send you the Full clip. That frank opened a box and He gave it away to the spike that he was teaming with. When the spike came to take it. He killed him. And then he spun to team with me. So I spun with him then this clip started.
---
I only spin at the end when. The player is toxic
---
Magnum donghoon

Press F To Pay Respect
---
How is Mortis wanted he's just a gravedigger minding his own business
---
I dont think star powers should nerf brawlers in anyway
---
Dont worry i can see it clearly
---
For a main bibi, this drawing is sooo awesome, I love it.

But farming power cubes from the angry Robo is a good strategy in duos

It's Duo u dumbdumb
---
Very good but do you think star is too much like 4500 is like ok?
---
Must be a great experience. I have also played against some pro players such as Cursed, SpenLc and JOS3K. They were very entertaining although I lost all the three games :)
---
[removed]
---
Epic and Mythic is the number you see.
---
Chance increase for legendary every box you open without new brawler.
---
XD
---
yeeeEEET
---
That‚Äôs all I can hear when I play her
---
Ooh, this is hot! ;)
---
Holy crap that is so great. Thanks for sharing
---
Skinny white human with short black hair... I don't see it either lol
---
nice drawing
---
Jubilee from the X-Men
---
Almost guaranteed that Tara and Rosa were together. Which still sucks that you got punished.
---
All that it means is that the amount of trophies that is considered pro is higher
---
Wow this post hurts. Enzou was doing organized teaming with other players, (Shadxw and Red Brawler are 2 of them high on the leaderboard rn) whereas I spent 7 hours grinding against good players in Brawl Ball to get to 1k...
---
Omg ur Soo gud with Morris omg I suck only in like 3 months I just get to rank 15 and u only 1 day :0
---
90% accurate. She‚Äôs good on some bounties and gem maps too. But in brawl ball, her slowdown is absolutely better.
---
So now every one as at least 2 star powers
---
yep
---
Which means they released all star powers when they are supposed to release 3?
---
Clash royale is at 320.000
---
Yeah this is weird
---
Just push higher. There isn‚Äôt a limit at 500 trophies. The competition is just higher up now.
---
That that far in trophies though
---
Google it I cant give u a good explanation
---
For the moment there‚Äôs only PC version,use ‚ÄúWallpaper Engine‚Äù in Steam and search ‚ÄúBrawl@ then u can get it.
---
Yes they do
---
Lol I literally just posted about this. Your % is nothing compared to mine !
---
Once everyone rank 20 there‚Äôs nothing to show offüòÇ
---
How can I reach the third ones?!
---
"I like star points"
---
Idk this just happened
---
You mean sick mode?
---
 ü§£I was wrong
---
So this is Ultra instinct ~ü§Ø
---
why?
---
Aight, thanks for the criticism!
---
You mean why did I?
---
Thanks, I will now imagine this whenever I see two Primos fighting.
---
Keep us updated.
---
Lmao I thought this was legit for a second
---
Same but whit 21 brawlers and 6k
---
Yes it is. It went into soft launch June 15th 2017
---
hello already imagined to do an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãremodeling of El Primo ??
---
I can only see two???

Highest I fought was 29

Your post has been removed, make sure to use the body of a post to elaborate on the title.

---
Ironically getting a bot to chase you is one of the best way to survive
---
Yeah, but if you get 800 trophies that is something to show off.
---
Well, kid, this isn't the first time you edit the game files, as you have more posts about it. Or will you say you have had many bugs happening?
---
Also, you seem to have A LOT of posts in a (useless) try to get karma and attention. So you learned how to edit the files, record a video, and get upvotes. Apparently it didn't work, as you kept posting the same things.
---
If this were true, not only you would have posted it the first days after the update, but also you would get noticed easily, and more people would also have the same bug. But guess what? You were the ONLY one with a "bug" so big, and you only posted it a week after the update, with enough time to edit the files. Wow, there are a lot of odd things, and they all make sense, but I guess it is true! This bug is true! Right? RIGHT?
---
Also, if this were really a bug, you would have said it to the developers by Twitter, or just spread it more on social network. By doing so, you would be forced to share more proof and stats like your tag, etc, but apparently you only show the same things over and over. Again, another odd thing, right? And apparently, your only backup proofs are a supposed friend saying "I don't see anything", wow, so weird and convenient one more time!
---
And finally, this game is ran by servers. None of the Supercell games have had any issues with servers being hacked or bugged this bug, until this random user at Reddit arrived. Weird, right?
---
So do yourself a favor and stop with this, it is only making you seem pathetic. There are more ways to get attention, and by doing this you are only showing us you are a depressed lonely boy looking for being accepted.
---
Go home Ash, you're drunk
---
Meh
---
You right

Simple geometry

Make Leon have at least a voice

They had us in the first half not gonna lie

LEON IS MY NAME STEALTH IS MY GAME
---
Oooh, big problem. I've killed plenty of Mortis (Morti?); they're dime-a-dozen friendly-killing scumbags - like you! *ow* no offense
---
As much as I disliked the change, the new model has kind of grown on me. Maybe it‚Äôs because I use Loaded Rico instead of default Rico. Maybe I should do a model of old Rico as a sort of homage to him.
---
Man you don't even know what does that mean
---
This... does put a smile on my face.
---
Huh neat
---
I‚Äôll probably wait until after I do Gene because I already promised I would do him next.
---
Press try?
---
If you managed to kill them, i assure you they were not like me, and nothing, nothing like the trap loose inside this building

Wow you can read

Coming from a Mortis, this means alot

Why does his look like anime
---
This, does put a smile on my face.
---
(Anger)
---
Do it now or I might just do it myself! (This is a joke not actually gonna steal the meme)
---
My animations in a nutshell
---
It's not that, it bcz people push their brawlers to the point that they're basically underskilled /powered
---
It's one of the bigger flaws of this game
---
More like the primo was just an idiot for waiting so long to pressure you
---
There's 3 throwers on one team lol. We crushed them in siege. It was not even fun
---
Uhhhh
---
#OPTIMUS
---
*suddenly Soundwave*
---
Yet the easiest to get
---
It's their fault thenü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, don't go with throwers in siege with randoms
---
Your felllow assassins will fight for you Leon
---
they never changed bo's icon they just remodeled him
---
I pushed to 600 before the changes and then it got reset to 550. Then I just tried him in stormy plains and it worked.
---
Nah. It's useful to have a thrower in siege. 
---
You know whaysnpt useful fanboy? Bad matchmaking ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)

U just sucked at it, relax

Shelly is beautiful in the bottom left pannel

:)
---
I know how to spell it jerk. Bo is a damn fighter and he swims in a sea with hearts?! and you guys call it OGMFGMGM SOOOO CUTEEEE WOWOOW NICEEE. This is a DAMN GAME. It shouldn't even have art posts. (exception of skin ideas WHICH IS IN GAME)
---
It worked :) simple and iconic
---
Yea maybe i accidently stole someones idea but i made the picture myselfüòÄ
---
Best post I've ever seen on this sub
---
Yh i might of accidentally stole someones idea but i made the pic myself
---
Tru but again, you as a dynamike main should understand that throwers are sometimes map dependent and/or team comp dependent?
---
Besides the areas with 1 tile gaps, I like it
---
Oh sorry, it looks really similar
---
a mecha skin for Leon would be the best in game, change my mind
---
Spike has a voice?
---
He doesn‚Äôt seem, HE IS, if he did that without teaming it would‚Äôve been very very very very very sad but not as bad as this
---
Have you tried signing in with Google, Facebook, or email?
---
Eita rapeize... Rabudo demais.
---
WHERE IS THE HAT?!??
---
The problem here is, I only play solo or duo showdown
---
Get clapped
---
Ok, sorry, but playing with randoms will still be fucking hell.
---
Either way, I am agreeing with you guys no worries
---
I think he referring to Bibi in the game, cuz her range is too short so she has to approach her target
---
***Upvote bot***
---
Do you know where the email sign in is? I could find the facebook and google play sign in but kind of useless since i dont use either of those things
---
get gems lol
---
Bibi got a whiff of franks arm pit
---
How about YOU stop posting shitposts?
---
Whoa I didn‚Äôt even realize this was Toma. If it makes you feel any better, a fair amount of the comment section has recognized that this guy teamed his way to the top
---
I miss those days üòî
---
thought the same lol
---
Wait, hold on, Mojang has a sub for fucking memes?
---
More like boils my nerves, actually.
---
Wait spike and poco gangs are enemies with Leon gang?
---
Exactly
---
Also the guy just organized teaming in showdown and cheesed his way to the top
---
hehe yea i hope that they will eventually get a take on it
---
Ah splendid
---
It says Cristo Love which I assume is the artist and then I love how OP put his username under the text as if it's his creation lol

Is ur phone iphone? Cuz if u have iCloud it will automatically be saved

Yeah, untill you reach 400+ trophies wehre throwers and ricos wont leave you alone lol
---
Lower quality than Mortis vs Dynamike shitposts
---
I actually love this idea, Would be great if Supercell added this.
---
Like, what the fuck do you guys want then
---
Idk where but probably yes
---
And also BO, I'm at 400 tho
---
how do you already have him max with sp
---
Well said. Even CoC made the progress easier for new players. And it was a needed one.
---
There is no death, only a change of worlds
---
Nice
---
only 1910's kids will remember
---
Played against a rank max level rank 19 leon with 10 trophies a few days ago, only thing I can think of is that they‚Äôre purposely losing trophies to drop.
---
Totally agree, lets hope supercell has something on their sleeve after their summerbreak ;)
---
Why
---
I was replaying it and when I saw that...
---
to drain your credit card
---
Like rank 25

Well, Congrats on your mortis

I feel you brother, i was only 11k before the update but i fully understand what you were saying, lets hope they does something huge after the summer and make the game more enjoyable üëç‚ù§
---
They would be the best mobile game developer if their games weren't p2w
---
I'm saying that if you open 20 boxes all at once is the same as opening 20 boxes separately.

Dont worry you will grind to 10k in no time because of the trophy inflation xD

It was just like I'm playing BS, no update info no news poping up on screen just pushing Colt to 410, and sudenly I get +8 in such a case no wonder I fought it wad glich :P
---
They will change few things after the summe so be a little patient and wait for the next brawl talk ;)
---
Or,to not complicate the game with new boxes,just give 2 mega boxes from around 5k to 7 k and 3 from 8 and above
---
not literally but usually mods there remove shit like this fast af
---
4 months, one SP.
---
Frisk*
---
Just make another account at that point
---
*_Too_* innocent.
---
Figga*
---
I totally feel you. I got to 10K with 23 brawlers before the update, but now it doesent feel that great anymore.
---
I think the update was litterally only meant to make getting star point easier and make people want to play with their brawlers over 500.
---
And it worked, because now I feel much more comfortable playing those brawlers.
---
I like that the update made pushing above 500 a better experience, but I dont like the fact that getting rank 20s is never gonna feel the same way it used to do. And of course, I dont like the fact that us players at the high trophies will have to push like crazy in order to get the same respect like we had before.
---
Yeah..
---
Sorry for the bad Engrish
---
Yeah, someone asked if they will ever add a LGBT character and Frank replied saying "What if we did already?"
---
Btw all of those brawlers you see (and Frank) where pushed to 500 before the update, except for Primo.

I think it would be better to change 20 levels of characters to 25 or 30
---
Lucky :)
---
i remember more than that
---
Nice.
---
So original
---
I had at least one skin discounted for a while until I bought a discounted Road Rage Carl. Since then, all skins in the shop have been priced normally.
---
just buy it dumbass it‚Äôs a great skin
---
Alright bud.
---
lwarb
---
Yup it hurts. I also have Barley at lvl 9, so that makes 3 star powers I still haven't got in all those boxes. Yay my luck!
---
-Sound effect on-
---
Pan Art?
---
?
---
I've a friend who mods the cr sub, and he as a pretty busy job cuz most of the time it's low-effort rant on the game. The mods can also be savage af tho at times

I need to see Bull‚Äôs ‚ÄúNani?‚Äù face bigger and higher quality than this. Please draw this for the sake of this community ~~so that we can make memes out of it~~

plus they look way better in the star point versions

It's cool.
---
My friend at 1k trophies above me has EVERYTHING.While I have 1 legendary,still no bibi, tara.
---
Since when Bull can do maths
---
How much trophies u have
---
Luck? Nah, that's pure skill
---
Welp :/
---
Just when you didn't think matchmaking could get any worse, they go and implement this... Wrong kind of balance needed imo. But who am I stop people from earning their lovely high ranked "earned" brawlers?
---
Yes its not related to bs "smartest person"
---
They're even complaining about Tara New Remodel.
---
Worse case scenario. I unlocked rico after his remodel and never had the opportunity to buy this skin for 30 gems
---
at least we got a good headstart on the push. I got to 10k right before the update aswell... It might be easy for everyone else to get there now, but it still takes some time grinding
---
7.2k
---
I wrote "Pan."
---
I don't understand what you saying :/
---
I don't think anybody but low level players complained about siege.
---
I for one hate solo showdown, I only play it for the star token, (not a big fan of duo either).
---
I want to play aggressively and solo showdown is just a camping/teaming shit fest, so my play style doesn't work in that specific game mode.
---
To gain that star token from a new sd map I sometimes lost 30 trophies or so, I didn't ask the game mode to be changed just to cater to my needs. I had a choice; risk losing a few trophies in my worst game mode to get a star token or just skip playing it.
---
Why change siege to please casuals when every other game mode is more casual?
---
Are you familiar with jojo reference?
---
F I agree
---
O ok sorry
---
Good one bud
---
nope
---
I knew something was fishy about the mecha skins price
---
Crow too
---
It's not that old... I still remember it tho.

I miss the old Rico model. It was more badass

This is kinda anime. You can serach in YouTube ora meme.

Oh my Notch...

Do you know about the spike one they said was coming?

Seriously though, it's seriously unbalanced for Shelly to get what's basically an overpowered Poco Super for herself. She already has a scary ass hand cannon of death.

No,at rank 10,15 and 20

I remember activating Darryl's super between the walls at the side of the enemy safe, and it was good.

Isn't worth it, from personal experience.

It wouldn't be that hard to draw a new one, in fact you could have the community draw one! There could be a whole contest surrounding it, and it's just another nice thing that could come with every update.

Looking forward to more!

I think he used to look a lot coooler

Why the fuck didn't he kill them?
---
Go to r/brawlstarscompetitive if you want to complain about art that took effort. Also, you edited your comment to fix the spelling error. There is a ton of art and memes on the subreddit, that what it is for. Not every single post had to be a replay of getting kills.
---
Nope

Yet, even in death, it succeeded in defeating the Darryl.

R.I.P old siege

Yeah. I think we all agree

Fortbyte?
---
what you did yesterday?
---
I‚Äôm proud to say that I got 500 trophies on all brawlers before the update!
---
what???
---
Lmao keep dreaming, look at the upvotes on your comments - toxic kid
---
LOL YEAH I MADE ANOTHER MEME OF ROSA
---
I got it a few days before
---
That doesn't make a difference in this case.
---
For a maxed Mortis to heal, he would first need to kill someone/get a skull from a dead brawler.
---
In this case, 1v1, that would be useless during the fight.q
---
My lord...
---
That‚Äôs the joke cring normi
---
The red one is better
---
So true
---
Yes
---
No this is survival
---
The fact that I saw this post on 69 upvotes cracked me up, upvoted!
---
*Throwers heaven*
---
Still remember it! the worlds ugliest skin and character model ever it was shite!
---
To many skulls
---
Im sorry if you're telling the truth
---
but what i saw in the video was teaming
---
Salty
---
Good ting you stole IT  and good try
---
At that time I had 30 gems, and I could buy either golden rico or golden barley. I bought a barley. But I had to take rico
---
yeah, there was teaming. But you can't lie that basically almost everyone who has played Brawl stars has teamed at least once
---
I got crow from 10k megabox and recently got leon from 49 gems mega box (only 1 box)
---
In good old days  KairosTime still uses camera filter
---
But he got 3rd place. Wasn't that bad, right?
---
I really hated the update
---
I played daily for at least 6 month with lvl 9 jessie and i still had to buy her star power in the shop
---
u/Frank_Supercell
---
29 gems. I say no more
---
Don‚Äôt worry, I camp for easy trophies when I need to reach a trophy milestone too lol
---
Sorry, didn't listen and saw the Crab rave video.

Finnaly Now I can Grind myself some more trophies For my hot Girl Rosa üòçüòòüòªüëß
---
Legendary just means that your chances of getting the Brawler are lower. If they'd give one to you at a fixed number of trophies it would just kinda be another milestone-Brawler.
---
Do you think these animals care?
---
Nah would rather protecc bibi
---
I remember times before auto-attack and horizontal gameplay
---
Which is another thing SC got rid of btw
---
Sorry if you hate teaming, but it was almost impossible for me to make my lvl 1 shelly Rank 20. I dont team at normal games. It was like 460 trophies when i played this match
---
Its just trash dont bother with it..
---
I have opened around 30 megas total and never got a single brawler out of them..
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Even the normal box gave me new brawlers frequently and megas only had pp for me

hey sorry if I'm wrong but your username suggests youre korean, and when written in korean it's Ìå¨ but the actual english translation is "fan"! hope this helped !!

Wow this is awesome !
---
In the old days it wouldnt matter because you would have almost everything in the game and the trophyroad rewards doesnt matter, but more gems or starpowers would be nice to get from trophyroad for example every 2-3k
---
Oh boi Spike with his family
---
There lies the reason
---
To get this exact reaction out of people like you.
---
No thank you sir.  I still only have 36 of those üò¢ season ends in 23 days right?
---
He was russian player what did you expect üòÇüòÇ
---
*You are breath taking*
---
it's not trolling, it just works lol. but yeah, I don't do it often cause my leon is at 300 only, and people there don't even realise when you have you super and go into a bush....
---
it's normal...
---
Unless you want to gain trophies more for some reason
---
Be like Colt
---
When is it?
---
Seriously?
---
r/Cringe
---
I added you my name is anthony
---
they said 3am wasnt bad
---
And not everyone want to grind above 700 trophies every 2 week for some starpoints that doesnt give anything but skins, but maybe after supercell tells what people will get with them more people will push more and gain something from it

Basically it is using only one charachter in a game where you have many choices
---
Where is the kill cam, I don't play this shit
---
Oh there like cheating snakes! I already hate them, thx!
---
do you think they nerfed his super too much?
---
This looks absolutely lovely
---
Lol I‚Äôm in the club right behind yours, you better push boy, because we are coming for your spot!
---
Bibi voice is annoying as fuck in my opinion
---
Nice fan art
---
Damn, u beat me to it to commenting about all might
---
getting to 11k is very easy now. and also your idea doesn't make sense because they are called legendary for a reason.
---
Lol, Shelly looks like a crow ))
---
(Her hair resembles a beak)
---
as a player who still dont have a brawler at 500, doesnt it give you a reason to push more?
---
I was always thinking that if i reach 500 someday i'll just have to stop playing that brawler.
---
Hell i even did that with some of my 350-400 brawlers and now im kinda happy i get to play some of my favorites again.
---
i mean i feel your struggle reaching there but its just a game.. i think they did that to give a reason to players like you to grind more... im only frustrated about the season reward system tbh
---
Well let him feel proud if he/she doesnt understand what the last update meant for trophies xD
---
Are you joking?? I‚Äôm at 13k and I would do some dirty things for 10k gold. That being said this reward is terrible and needs to be adjusted.
---
*sad Mortis noises* Why do u hate Mortis?
---
Then i heard someone is knocking the door
---
but thats the whole point of being a legendary brawler
---
they‚Äôre not trophy road brawlers
---
When she says: "another round?"
---
not a bad idea didn't think of that. thanks a lot man
---
whenever song reaches that high note, eveyone gets spam healed

El Primo wins

Would be cool to have Bo plant more than just 3 mines..

o   r   g   y

Confirmed to be working on other brawlers , Auto_aim_range is different from aim_range
---
Thanks \ (‚Ä¢‚ó°‚Ä¢) /
---
How about instead a legendary chance increase
---
Bad wifi okay yeah good... Bad wifi?
---
You would have gotten a legendary with that chance, easily.
---
Give this man an award

knowing how his hand works, he'll legit just pull pam out of her seat

Prepare for trouble!

---
Really? I‚Äôm at 11k and have 50k gold in the bank with nothing to do with it. Regardless, 150 gold is useless at pretty much any level past 4K
---
Coach cory is homeless confirmed
---
Well yes but actually no in america

I have Leon and I have 5000 trophies...LOL

Does it happen when you go into a game, when it hits 100%, it goes back down to 92% then crash the game?
---
Me too
---
ahahhahahahahahahahaha such in imbecile
---
...New maps, new skins, a new Brawler, new Star Point system, new environment, new voiceovers, new model for Tara, even a new background and music for the menu.

When you brag about your 5 power cubes and you see an el primo with 10 power cubes jumping on you

Black and Yellow

Could also have left rosa‚Äôs glasses there

If people see you have your super and then run into a bush while they‚Äôre chasing you then they‚Äôll freak the fuck out.  It‚Äôs great

Amen, f2p don‚Äôt get enough coins. I have 13 brawlers that need upgrades from power 6-7 and 7-8, each upgrade costs 450 or 800 gold

Or more like bulls or shellys mortis isn‚Äôt  #that bad against primos

Teaming Primos.......he is pretty bad against them.

Yes.

Does he really? I dont even see them pop up in the shop

ART TRIEFER

It‚Äôs happened to everyone

Nice idea mate! Mortis can have a friend now :D
---
It is actually a Shelly with Band-Aid
---
There are people who thing you will die and when they spawn in they don't even move/shoot while you survived everything coming your way like a boss
---
Yeah, but once he properly caught up, you are close to dying, it would only be useful to negate chip damage from afar
---
Supercell just stole from this guy
---
He doesn't. It's just some random formulas. He just knows one must have some of those when thinks. So, they fly around because of that.
---
The trophy system is awesome for me cuz the randoms at 7.8k trophies are still somehow trash and getting shit teammates wont take away the win I just got
---
No
---
THIEF
---
I disagree. Games like Dota and League of Legends have so much variety people don't get bored. Even games that are buy to play, but could easily have been F2P with cosmetic monetization like Rocket League and Overwatch, are massively popular. There's no P2W in any of these games.
---
Thats actually the rest of the omaiua meme.
---
Also I feel like ill get wooshed.
---
It‚Äôs still adding smart one it equals to 32

Haha it did make me smile. Great work man!

People almost always get legendary after 5000 trophies

I got crow at 4 am so it‚Äôs not so much of a bad idea

Dang nice man! Happy 4th of July for you too ;)
---
But beta isnt the real thing /s
---
I appreciate your enthusiasm for sarcasm, but indicating it defeats its purpose.
---
I am herobrine xddd
---
Good work that was awesome!!!
---
Ahhh, Good old days
---
if this ain‚Äôt true
---
Thats why i always say nerf El Primo
---
Outstanding move!
---
It directly translates to pervert in Japanese. Why he said pervert in English right after, no clue.

Bubble trouble!

Say no more! No, really. Please never comment again.

r/woooosh ...sorry
---
I thought 0.4 was the highest legendary chance possible, did you mean 0.12?
---
It kind of... Yes..
---
remember a time each team in heist must have a darryl or lose
---
am i considered og if i downloaded the game the day of global release because i couldn‚Äôt get it in my country before
---
Colt is like erza of fairy tail
---
Piper was released first then it was pam and Tara
---
Nah it‚Äôs a lot more satisfying to see your enemy just disappear and it might be confusing also because for example in dynamike‚Äôs one it would look like his threw a shot before he died which will just make things confusing.
---
This is such an under appreciated comment Hahahaha

You removed my comment but not this low effort crap?

Know your meme it's "do my eyes deceve me or is that the sword of a thousand thruths" and bibi would be like "I am afraid it is"

Alternative reward like mega box, gems or other stuff

Also bibi is verry good at bb

Voodoo and Ketchapps developes like eleventy billion shitty ad ful games

Supercell developes quality long lasting fun games thats not TOO cash grabbing (kind of a controversial topic but I GUARANTEE you Supercell's TOP TOP priorities are NOT money, it's to make a game everyone can enjoy that will last FOR DECADES)
---
excuse me what the fuck am i getting this out of context

Leon probably.

He lost his arms in the war... the Cold War....

Where is carl?

Yes ...

This is pam in a Jessie outfit

Same for me

I agree with him

Oh great i tilted back to 598 trophies :/ (ty randoms)

time to hold shift

Of course it‚Äôs a Rosa cattle
---
Not only you bud, me too...
---
So every time I have 1 trophy left to reach a new rank. Supercell does always this to me: Puts me in with an afk team member, puts me with star power enemies, puts me on a spot where no boxes are, every hit I receive but its a miss it counts, every hit that I hit counts as a miss, etc. So than I rage quit
---
Awesome, saw this on Brawl Stars Global
---
Tick's head.
---
Thanks for helping me
---
It's going to be a new brock skin
---
So i will eat it
---
I just got 6000 trophies yesterday
---
The pins and badges were always my favorite. Those were the days.
---
Thank you wanted someone to post it so bad
---
I'd love to have that position
---
Also I think they also have a forums if contacting them from their website doesn't work
---
OMG YES! Earthbound is my favorite game of ALL TIME!
---
My main problem is teamers, if you play a tank you know the struggle. Also if I have a lot of power cubes, the last two team on me so I always be 3rd
---
# NO, not now
---
Him and every 1k shelly rn except toma got their trophies from organised teaming in showdown.
---
Bruh
---
Not stupid, I don‚Äôt understand either
---
Hamburge-oh wait it's a giant robo spike
---
That was the rumour, anyways. They had different drop chances, but the colour was a troll :(
---
Gg!
---
Same, but when I play solo and only hide in bushes so I can get that 1 JUST ONE trophy, I will get killed at last 6 or above
---
i'm scared...
---
Or his gun
---
Salty poor boi lol
---
All I am asking is to get ONE TROPHY
---
Mmmhmmm why not leave the brawlers bloody corpse there too
---
Bird abuse
---
Don't ask why im here i also am asking myself rn
---
I remember you and portal writing essays on thus subreddits and am glad its still going
---
Oh so like they find each other in game and team to kill other players? Wow this is impressive
---
Q U I C K M A T H S
---
You can get banned if you do organized teaming. They are literally asking to get banned
---
If u are saying this because you don't get the funny out of the conversation, I'm glad to answer. In game, Colt says repeatedly he's too pretty, so they are making jokes of it.
---
Where the fuck is Carl?
---
Oh wow I got played so many times then. I still miss the medal system
---
It remembers me the Nokia screen when you turn ona Nokia phone
---
I do as well, tbh. It was very unique and added a bit more variety than ‚Äúpress to upgrade‚Äù.
---
Nice i don't have a single 500 so screw gettibg to brawl tv
---
wouldn't it be better if the boxes came up on the map and power cubes improve the whole team? 
---
so we could mount some strategies like "certain brawler breaks the boxes while the others attack the robot"
---
Nitaaa!
---
Nope. I believe 56 or so is the record. Might be wrong.
---
Too much lag in throwers maps
---
So much customization. I believe they removed because it was to complicated for the new players and for the younger audience.
---
tbh that sounds cool
---
Why?
---
Yes it does you have to have patience
---
At least they didn't make her thicc
---

And the 150 coins on 10.5k trophies to?

He already got a remodel, you absolute dong.

I didn‚Äôt mean that last part.  I just though it was a good pun.

Thank you! ‚ù§Ô∏è

oh thank you üòÅ

I already have 10 star powers (none of the new ones)

With 6 power level 9s

Rest are power 8 with enough pp to 9

What did he do?

Man

You just need to improve at the anatomy and you'll be good to go.
---
Actually no
---
Frank said in twitter few months ago darryl need minor improvements 
---
I know in past update patch note it said he got a new model but he got new pose not a model remodel
---
Do a solo on dat bass
---
Me after you made a Good meme (üòîall that work for nothing)
---
lol still noice.
---
They could do it like they do in Brawlhalla. Basically in their game, whoever gets the kill gets to see their opponent eviscerated in a really cool animation. But you have to buy the animation, which costs real money - perhaps they could do it with Star points *and* Gems in Brawl Stars.
