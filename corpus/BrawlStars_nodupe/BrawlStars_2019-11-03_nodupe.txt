While it is very frustrating to have to deal with players like this, they might have just been lagging.

Dude... lmao

You can literally see him trying to move into the AOE/Shooting us at times. He wasn't lagging. You can  also see him moving in a pattern to avoid the AFK warning.

its kinda dumb that experience, the only thing that truly tracks your accounts age has a cap

I agree. The reason why they are called ‚Äúlegendaries‚Äù is because they are really hard to unlock.

I'm talking about when you face straight to a wall but with a small angle you'll go towards that angle that's cind of a owing and it starts happening 'prety far' I'm just saying the should nerf the radius of that thing turning you. And sorry for my spelling English is not my first language.
---
Supercell NEVER update new skin attack .We HATE it. Eventhought IT NEED MANY update
---
Happened to me with Darryl, but I was 2 powerpoints away and it took me a few days to get them
---
I accidentally used today.
---
I got him the night before his first nerf. I didn't even get to enjoy him being OP for a day.

Very good, you did an excellent job.

I played them at a same frequency, currently both at 600+ xD
---
Que mal rollo da el joputa
---
Thanks you so much!!!
---
Great answer, but absolutely not xD
---
Damm that‚Äôs impressive
---
Why did I read the first part as "Mecan"?
---
Yeah, the old drop rates were built for every brawler to have 1, now we need like 0.0175 as the baseline
---
This feel like FNAF
---
Darryco
---
I haven‚Äôt even unlocked BO. I don‚Äôt understand how these peeps be all maxed out like it‚Äôs a casual phone game don‚Äôt you have things to do or you just spend all day every day playing. Idgi
---
Well typically, you would want your turret to survive to get more use out of it. And it‚Äôs not like it would defend a whole lot of damage anyways.
---
But yes, people who stand in the turret after they are enraged are bad.
---
Golden carrot is the best thing in the game though because it's not hard to get and really good.
---
Luck but 9/10

Bawl...

You should have made sandy instead of Leon cause Leon is always invisible...

 Hey! This is a nice meme. I'm using it in my next video. :)

It‚Äôs called a gameroom

My best is 6:09 and it's ok but it's not the best.Its pretty good though and you did well üòä
---
You are a superhuman
---
They need to come out with a cheap Bo skin
---
Why would you think being high in trophies makes you good at the game lol?
---
No there turn into rock statue with their shape brawler on
---
are you thinking of ‚ÄúThe Lions Sleep Tonight‚Äù?
---
I think it's a good idea but it's a bit too crowded.Maybe take away a bit of the walls?
---
Don‚Äôt make shitty dyna bad posts

Do you even read the other comments?

Extra Toxic Squared

I know that, and I‚Äôm just saying that if I had any legendaries or star powers I‚Äôd probably be far above where I am now
---
Hey you're the guy who makes mapmaker memes!
---
no he is definitely one of the worst.
---
Shitty super, supposed to be good at close range but still hard countered by Bull, El Primo and Shelly.
---
And gets easily outranged by snipers and throwers.
---
Yeah
---
What's the meme here then ('~')
---
Nice
---
Not a meme this time, just trying to make a map that is both practical and aesthetic
---
I dont know man, but I have a G e m m e r  vibe whenever I look at the picture...
---
I think less than -5
---
Just stop playing frank in robo rumble and you will see the difference dummy
---
someone give this man an award
---
i‚Äôm 15k and still trickshot just for the fun of it... i agree with you completely
---
13.500.. No legendary. 7/8 brawls ready for level 9. Life of a F2P sucks
---
His super is great for movement, and getting agressive and auto charges. It can easily be used to get in a fight against a lower health foe like maybe a colt, then have your super charged enough to get out of a situation fast
---
He is countered by close range, by he has a bit of range himself so you can literally just poke the foe and stay out of the range of them
---
Darryl may be outranged, but his super that charges fairly quick means you can close the gap, and he is just tanky enough for you to effectively close a gap
---
Trust me, definitely has a learning curve. I used to think he was absolute trash, but I actually learned how to play him effectively and now I love him.
---
that one tryhard who leaves all their brawlers at power 1
---
HIS.

---
Very cool, what is it in his head?
---
The bottom turrets wall is off or is it just me

Bit obnoxious with the watermark, probably would put it in the corner or over the characters with a transparency filter, still good meme tho 6.5/10.

Skittles. Taste the rainbow üåà

It's fucking shit

Yeah I play with them cuz they don't want to feel down and quit the game when I reject them, that is what I experienced when I was at 2k trophies. Now I'm at 14k and I still play with lower level trophies!

Wow level 1 crow looks very different

Geez even at 500 trophies?

Edit: oh its island invasion, makes sense. For this map, this shit happens at all trophy range i guess

Happened to me on piper. I was so mad
---
^this
---
Ok pls shut up downvote
---
No, I don't know
---
I hope your comment is irony...
---
Lmao no it doesn‚Äôt. Sure it says how much experience you have, but it doesn‚Äôt necessarily gauge your skill level. There are numerous people at 15k who‚Äôre useless without a premade team. I‚Äôd say around 18-20k is when you can actually say trophies mean that player is good at the game; at least from my perspective.
---
Ok now i know it is a joke now, put (joke) if you are joking because people might get confused
---
What kind of porn did u watching that your balls explode to confetti?
---
Map name:Stars in grass

P.S i named youre other sd map (sandy rocks)

I guess he does

I think its pretty good :)
---
I hope you make it

:3
---
unless you gave brawlers over 800 trophies, I‚Äôd say it doesn‚Äôt really matter imo. The trophy revamp made it easier to gain than to lose trophies. I mean if you care about trophies that much, then you do you.
---
That's a big ass shoe. Lol

Great work! Please draw more.

Yeah I‚Äôm tired of people with your trophy count in my random player pool too...
---
Great
---
Its so good hope this gets noticed
---
I don‚Äôt even know what all those people mean with karma. Points on your Reddit profile?
---
Creepy Harvest is occasionally a better choice in Bounty or Gem Grab, due to its ability to kill multiple enemy brawlers, but usually, Coiled Snake is the better choice, especially in Showdown and Brawl Ball.
---
Made me laugh
---
I win if i play with randoms, but i lose if i play with friends.
---
Woow! How diplomatic! :O
---
You have to go into "Setting"--&gt; "help and support" and tap the icon in the top right corner.

Ah yes

Oh ok thanks for help.

yes
---
Dont most phones game "game sense"
---
When u turn on a game, it shuts off all notification pop ups and even minimizes calls
---
So does Darryl!
---
I've seen very few mortis players that were very good in brawl ball, mortis was good in brawlball...
---
Infact mortis in the older brawlball where you don't use your "attack slot" was a goddamn beast. Now is still decent but very *VERY* difficult to use because his reload speed is very slow. So if he waste a shot for throwing the ball and another one goes to dash forward you'll have only one shot to goal and most of the time you will not have enough time to reload.
---
The real challenge is getting them, upgrading is easy until power 7
---
Iys pretty good

Great concepts for winter skins! I hope these really get into the game!

A little tip, even though it doesn‚Äôt sound very useful: Try drawing the curves from the shoulder, not the hand.

Also, try curving the shadow in the eyes, and as an extra, set a shadow around it slightly higher.

Why millennials?

Nita: don't be intimidated Nita, try to imagine him without the hoodie
---
Nita: **OH NO HE'S HOT**
---
Remember like a month ago, there was an offer of 49x mega boxes for 49 gems? Thats a reason why he has a lot of brawlers he never played
---
And bo because he walked in front of the crow and chased him away
---
She‚Äôs embarrassed for him
---
Omg
---
Leon got harem hair, he goin to get the girls lol
---
Nay you didn't mess up, there are different styles of drawing and this one counts. It looks great
---
Oh, yea, thanks
---
Frank is one of the best brawlers for the game mode. Why Mortis?
---
I was able to upgrade like 6 brawlers to level 9 but I'm not getting the star powers. I am still missing 8 and only got one in the last month
---
Probably chose the wrong gamemode. Then well, that happened
---
Cute nita :3

1: the power play is cave churn

2: you get 3 powercube

This is true I started playing from beginning and  now most of my friends started playing they have  1000-3000

Sometimes i forget leon has hair. Actually wait does he have hair? Is it cannon?

This is just the dynamike and the tick dancing to poco music combined... idc if downvoted, but really low effort

That haircut reminds me of something wrong

Can‚Äôt have 109 _g r e e n d i a m o n d s_ if you uninstall the game

Just play lol

Also try to spin in showdown something epic will happen :)

Piper super got a buff two times already (atleast). She used to only have 3 bombs also the bombs used to be in a random spot

do it

get a mini and carry him there

Try removing the 1 tile gaps like the one in bottom left corner between the lake and the border and you're good to go!

How many trophies do you have?
---
Bump on you to attk
---
Yeah, feel free.
---
Lol what an idiot  they csnt ban them just by knowing the name, a lot of people could have that name, the only thing that is different is the ID
---
Wi-fi dropped by 1 bar
---
Huh?
---
I cant even upgrade 7 brawlers to power 8, 8.9k
---
The new one looks much better
---
Well, obviously. At first, I thought it was just miscommunication because I thought Mortis was going after the ball which he'd then pass to me, but then I realized he was a traitor, so we just gave up. 
---
Not much we could do.
---
What do you mean?
---
Agreed. It's also the same for Tara. On her icon, her eye is on the left side but when u play her, her eye is on the right side.
---
Same. Dynamike is ok
---
It will be like primo's super to attack you
---
i didn't even buy him
---
&amp;#x200B;

**cries in f2p in the corner**

wait too familiar drawing style ... wait
---
It actually happened to me quite a few times now,  other than walking into the poison. What else can I do ?
---
Hoodiehomies? Tf is that. Also, I don't care what happens in Leon gang
---
Swirls (and the top right corner doesn't have boxes
---
This is just the same clip why did you just use the original clip.
---
Yes ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
---
You know
---
Miss the time when ppl just use Pam or Jessie or at least they know what they are doing
---
Yeet
---
The money depends on how many power points they are like yours 550 power points and the money will be x2 of the power points
---
I'm collecting BS fanart... can u please send me the picture without the name blurring it on my Instagram? @wind_.s
---
Random. I was max Pam, there was a 8 bit and a Jessie
---
7:22 but the best load out is a Pam a 8 bit and something like bull or frank to get multiple at once or really high damage and tank.Then you use the stations from 8 bit and pam to heal and increase your damage.
---
"Regularly hits 18k?" lol
---
How many brawlers, that will define the skill level lol
---
B for bruh
---
Ok this is by far the best brawl stars animation i've EVER seen!! Amazing, gotta download this!
---
Yes. I couldn‚Äôt draw it cuz I don‚Äôt have the skin..üòÇ
---
you can apply this with colt, nita, mortis, piper, shelly, poco, ricochet, dynamike, and barley. brock's old skin, though, is untouchable.
---
Cute ‚ù§
---
Take my updoot
---
thick queen
---
I think not.
---
Yeah, if you are like the jessie and do that, it's your problem and you suffer. I've seen many people attack other brawlers only and get 10th place. When the shield is active, its the time to pick up free power cubes and catch up on walking to the boss. Just saying, jessies don't know the optimal strategy which is trying to attack every single brawler and get 10th place. Ruining everyone's life
---
Allrighty, now open the game, at the right corner of the screen there should be a button with three stripes.Click that then choose settings then supercell ID then logout, Lastly select play without option which will appear after you log out.

So basically...

Fair point. Try hard players like me are on tour like 4 hours a day. Most people are on the same time because of school and other work. So everybody has a relatively mutual time they play. I live in the US and there are many high trophy players there. Yet I still get matched up with 8ks who suck
---
Wish that was Inn the game, also put [ IDEA ] in the title at the start
---
I scrolled all the way to the bottom of my profile.
---
Don‚Äôt play dumb, any brawl stars player would know that.

I think I have seen this before but still

this is not a brawlstars meme, keep it on topic please

Oh shit. I thought It was because of Monster Hunter heh. Im so sorry
---
woooooooooow
---
Awesome. And I thought 11 to 13.5k was good
---
But That's Just An Opinion, i didn't deserve this. Would it be fun if i downvoted all your comments just because you said "Piper Sucks"? (now this is just an example)
---
don't be like op who plays rico in robo rumble
---
So.. Which one are the actual Bruce? üëÄ
---
i always thought that leon was bald
---
Don't worry.. That's why i ask your permission to record this gameplay.. To expose this kind of scum.. To let Brawl Stars admin know, the importance of "REPORT BUTTON" :)

You didn't look closely, at first it's right they have red checks but at the last box you need to look closely, it was with red lines (a.k.a blushing)
---
probably so they wouldn't be broken in showdown

Imagine for a second what she does to them.
---
Yo playing on a DS or somethin?
---
litty
---
The best balance for her  is to decrease bonus damage from ambush from 800 to 500. Also make brock be able to 2 shot brawlers with exact health like piper
---
? So if I made a video of that right now and upload it on this subreddit would you acknowledge my opinion.
---
Piper and crow are op now

forreal?

1000 on Tick ü§¢

That's why tick is my favorite brawler

Someone stole this post and posted on their Instagram page

Woooosh

That is generally playing as 2 players

Teaming in brawl ball be like
---
A little as my post

I have the same problem. I got tilted to 680 from 750 with Darryl. I get that some people just want to get more power cubes, but if it‚Äôs a Piper or a Colt with TWELVE POWERCUBES, AND THEY START SHOOTING ME, WHO ONLY HAS TWO... that‚Äôs where I get problems...
---
Also, are there any free audio recorders that only record screen audio? If not, I'll just stick with mobizen
---
Does it matter?
---
congrats

That's usually what I do too, I get all star tokens (usually, I admit I sometimes don't feel like playing Siege or Lone star too), and for some of the brawlers I like the most I push a little bit with them every season. But that's it, I don't spend hours everyday nor do I ever get into tryhard mode pushing to more than 750 trophies on a brawler, because I know I don't have the time nor the will to keep it up. I've been doing this since a week or so after global and now I've been sitting at 15k-16k every season for the past couple months, still missing Leon and Sandy and many star powers, but that's to be expected. I'm still having fun and not getting burnt out, which is what usually happens when you get there too soon.
---
Actually, that's the way you should be playing the gamemode... If you think shooting at others is how you are supposed to be playing, you are the one being a dick
---
Bo's super vision should also see invisible brawlers, thats a suggestion. 
---
maybe gene should have a star power where he creates walls instead of destroying them with his super

They could increase it but then people with an old android phone from 2010 will complain they don‚Äôt have enough space to download it

The prev. Primo looked more fat than strong lol

This should be linked to the cloud so it wont really take the games space

Wouldnt work matchmaking on ticketed events already takes awhile so if its for your ticket count youre never getting in to the game..
---
as someone in a club where i have 20000 trophies and there is a bunch of people below 5000 this is pretty annoying.
---
Because people like it anyway?
---
That's metal bat from OPM

Congrats! Crow was also my first legendary, got him from 7K megabox back in days. Still, even though I now have them all, I love to play Crow most. Today I've been grinding few hours using Sandy though. He is so easy to push in low trophy games, Leon I use almost only when playing sd, and Spike I use seldom nowadays.
---
The harder he gets hit the stronger he gets, or as he says pumped up
---

Takedown is now my favorite solo mode

Yes XD

I like how piper doesnt even act like piper she just throws a bone and turns into sans
---
Edited
---
An age lol
---
 Bruh I have 15748 trophies and I don't have a legendary, and my friend with 6566 has Crow and Leon.
---
It Better be a Pirate Voice Frank üò°
---
I dont have him
---
Repost
---
I have 3 friends who have legendaries
---
First got his at 12,000 trophies approx
---
Second at 4k mega box
---
Third at at 900 trophies approx
---
And i got mine at 7500
---
So there's no trophy range where legendaries are very likely. You'll get one when the time comes, you just gotta be patient! Hope you can get your first soon if you haven't already.
---
What‚Äôs your limit?!

---
You now what? But do you know you are on 14k? Anyway congratulation, now you have everything good from the trophy road, now it will be useless. 
---
Do you remember when you got brawlers, power points and mega boxes from the trophy road? Cause that's over now and you can only remember that, but atleast when there's a new brawler for the trophy road released, you can collect it right away and you already got the old rewards, so that's pretty nice (like when emz got released, i already had the mega box for 8k trophies opened and got rewards, but i also got emz, so i got a mega box and emz from the 8k trophy rewards)
---
How did this happen?

Depends on the map you are playing in

Uh you know that this template is from reddit and then someone from instagram stole it and now you post the instagram one? You could also just look at the other posts with this template, there even is a post with just that empty template

Wait you credited the reddit user who made the template? So what's the point of this post?
---
Yea you‚Äôre just stupid, sorry.

Yeah this would be nice
---
It depend s on the type of beep boops

I hope this goes to the top!! üîùüîùüîù
---
omg sans pipertale or piperune
---
Im mostly free to play, so this was my first legendary. I felt the same way, buying him instead of getting him out of a box. Normally, I wouldn't recommend spending gems on a legendary, but the only way to get the limited skin is to buy Leon as well. If you know that you are going to use him, then I say go for it. The werewolf skin is arguably the best in the game, and 499 gems for the skin and the brawler is a really good deal.
---
Yarr you just got ROLLED
---
And thats why....
---
Well, you guessed wrong.
---
Your post has been removed, make sure to use the body of a post to elaborate on the title.
---
What?
---
Edit: oh wait nevermind
---
Post it on r/CouchCorySubmissions and title it ‚Äúmy best Darryl gameplay (8 kills)‚Äù and you might be in one of his review videos
---
Oh that explains a lot... my impression playing 400-500 trophies now it's like old 200-300 trophies... i guessed if general play level of the people has been lowered or something. But if now "high" trophies are way more than 500, it explains everything. Thanks!
---
XD I did one like this but yours is beter
---
Yeah, but what was the clown
---
Yeah i see, now 500 trophies ain't what it used to be... that's why it's so easy to climb on that range atm. Thanks!
---
Ha! I‚Äôm taking spanish 1!

Yeah, pushed him 850 on life leach this season

No, teaming bad, bad Dynamike!

#MADE WITH THE BLOOD OF RANDOMS#

Probably lol
---
wow so true
---
I love how leons costume is like "u wat"
---
Well you wouldn‚Äôt have because you took no more incoming damage after the mooshrooms, although the mushrooms could have directed you away from shots making the mushrooms the saviour of your day. But most likely not lol
---
I tought Harry would never team :/ He wants to do alone everything
---
Literally at the end of that video it shows these teams playing bounty. So explain that.
---
Is this the order you unlocked them?
---
Lmao
---
Yea
---
I'm not a dev nor artist but that shouldn't take a lot of space in the game, of course if they don't do it really big, skin icons with some decent resolution won't take so much space.
---
I'm really good with both. That's why I asked.
---
Oh wow, well ok
---
What about exclusive skin Reindeer Nita

Why repost

I think you're confused, the meme is talking about those people that throw their turret outside the middle of the map, like outside the main walls, lucky you if you haven't had those people
---
What if I told you that the green smoke took Shelly, therefore showing it has to do with showdown.
---
tortoise
---
Yeah I see your point there are other ones that deserve it and really are great but dude why be toxic I mean I saw what you said to this person and wow you really are toxic I mean yeah it‚Äôs low quality but what if he never knew about screen recording in the first place and yeah it is low quality but who knows this person could be a thirteen year old that barley has reddit and I mean he only has 37 days and dude he is trying his best to try and get something out there and yes I will agree with you on this it is low quality but that doesn‚Äôt give an excuse to bash his hopes by calling his posts pathetic and other stuff like that like dude what if you were this guy and you got your own posts bashed with a anvil full of negativity and I see this person having potential in the future he just needs to grow and learn and holy shit dude you just want him to stay low on the ground don‚Äôt ya
---
Someone had a bad day.
---
Lol I play gene and get an army of bots chasing me then I pull the boss onto the safe

Neither is you commenting your toughts on the internet yet here we are

Not trying to act like some child and point hands but in truth, he started calling me pathetic first and telling me to grow up and shit. Now I wasnt that toxic at first cause all I had said first was that his upvotes were bots. I just can't stand it when kids just be like "grow up" when they dont understand what they're talking about.
---
I always lose every single game since the brawlers I have maxed don‚Äôt work well on the maps
---
I just got Bibi!

They act like they are above everyone else and can do whatever the hell they want.

U dont even need to tell me how long this took u beautiful masterpiece

I mean, theres some weird coach cory sh*t, also the weird weeeeird kids that somehow know how to post here. Mine had a joke at least...or a common quote, this one in particular i remember seeing on some cartoons i believe.
