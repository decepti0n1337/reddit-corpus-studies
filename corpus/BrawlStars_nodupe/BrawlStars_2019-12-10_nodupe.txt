I don‚Äôt like the fact that there will be a new rarity of brawlers
---
---
---
inSTARgram
---
I know lol
---

---
Plus, the flitter is rarity
---
dude was tryna team with u lol u not movin prolly made him think u were DTD
---
Stop complaining, I'm at 12k and I'm missing Leon and Sandy. Smh I hate how people complain when they have way more things than you
---
Try Poco from Skyrim next time.
---
The legendary old model :&lt;
---
the darryl skin is just rare?
---
bro im feeling like im the only one who owns this skin
---
Carl: I am 4 parallel universes ahead of you
---
So cute
---
Too late mate I bought Spike and Leon... with regret
---
That happens when a wall-breaking super (happens a lot with El Primo and Shelly) is triggered at the same time you use your super.
---
You can't just steal something and recolor it. Seriously? Have some OG content.
---
Brock or penny, they both suck
---
Nah, day mode has Pony setting
---
See you in hot
---
I got Leon from mega
---
I can top that, I got leon at 250

Can I have your mom?
---
anime harems be like
---
Test it out, she is the only brawler that has voice lines when u don‚Äôt have her selected. U need a friend to help u

No u day. The one day when Tara gets a skin
---
oh yeah **~~that's hot~~**
---
i didnt know this and now i feel like a boomer too even though im a kid
---
Well, if you think that way, all actual games characters are copy of others from past games, you talk bullshit man :/
---
Done man
---
Nice art btw , i know! What is she uses her summer skin niceeeeeeeeee art
---
This is absolutely amazing, I love it!

No cuz most of them are bad ideas

Brock is bad? Get good scrub also Shelly is OP you are obviously a omega noob lol
---
Posted just 3 hours ago
---
Hmm interesting
---
Wouldn‚Äôt that be after nerf?
---
Thx I didn't know sorry
---
Everyday we stray further from God's light.

How?
---
Yeah Super cell bring it on üê™ üòÇ
---
True
---
Good job
---
Busy with school, don‚Äôt play too often.
---
Maybe in two to three months I can get there.
---
That was the tiniest update, which already happened.
---
Ok 
---
But don't you have holidays?
---
What country are you from?
---
Thatd be tricky to do. He'd have more mobility as a result,  not just better dps. So unless they also gave a bunch of characters speed buffs, thatd be unlikely.
---
I‚Äôm from U.S.
---
And I have better things to do during the holidays, I mean I‚Äôll play, but not too much.
---
When you unlock Emz 
---
Dm me and we will play a lot
---
No
---
In my opinion Leon will always be OP- he can frickin go invisible and then kill an enemy with one or two shots, which is unstoppable. What they need to do is reduce his movement speed and increase area of his visibility when he‚Äôs invisible.
---
Hi dad, I'm hot
---
Damn dynamike is RIPPED
---
I don't get it

What's wrong with Mama J? Well it wasn't a big shock for me at least

---
U kiddin? Colts always attack
---
Yeah apparently it‚Äôs rlly rare to get it, it‚Äôs like a 0.01% chance to become the star player on the losing team
---
This is completely false. Every brawler I've ever played with is in the orange tier.
---
Isn‚Äôt that crazy because Star Wars IX is coming in 10 days I remember so it can be a type of publicity

thank you

First of all Nice and second of all You can be really mad about it

It starts with T and rhymes with Steaming

Lmaooo world record you dont even have the star power
---
Thank you for telling me to look at his profile
---
*grabs tissue*
---
No one cares. Down voted
---
its because in the beta dynamike used to have a rarity, now he's a trophy road
---
I hate when this happends
---
speech 100. also i used [pixilart.com](https://pixilart.com) because that is where i make pixel art sometimes (under the same username)
---
Don't forget about sandy.
---
I dont even give you permision but ok
---
It gained traction so you removed it... Profanity was censored, and this is not a personal attack. No rules have been broken here.
---
Wait what.
---
Rosa is annoying to deal with on Gem Grab.
---
Mortis: I like those odds
---
And if they also doubled ticketed events' tockens
---
"hey are you sleeping"
---
"yes leave me alone"
---
"plankton can't aim because he doesn't see distance with one eye. What about Rico?"
---
"..."
---
I always thought that this skin of mortys was a jojo reference to josuke.
---
Or it could simply just the brawl stars team memeing again
---
First time?
---
Yes way
---
Imagine your team are all bulls and Shelly and you meet 3 dynamikes with dyna-jump
---
you should be proud, this is sooooo cool, haha get it, cool... Any way good job I want this to be in game :D
---
I also have this bug. Do you know why this happens?
---
From this reply alone, I can tell ur not good at English since u clearly cant read the title smh, basically, the Korean words mean something like "sexual assault towards women" and the AI of brawl stars can't prevent this account from putting this offensive name since it can't read Korean. Let's say if you put ur name as something inappropriate, Supercell's bot will check and make sure it's not inappropriate so the game is child friendly but Ofc there's stupid ass Ppl that put shit like "DigBick" or something like that, if it is inappropriate, it will say "that name is unavailable"
---
Yup, I did it on accident tho xd
---
*cries in rosa*
---
It's after the nerf.
---
Dynamike, he's one of the most annoying brawlers in the game
---
Probably wasnt, have you seen an English kid randomly type IWantToHaveSex as a name? Lol
---
This was a Very well edited video and it will get to hot
---
AND THATS A FACT
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure it says happy
---
Just learn to play with him, he is very good without Star Powers, not like Leon
---
Dont they release an animation first
---
Happends always
---
Ok:)
---
how old is Jessie again
---
Ok, thanks
---
HABLABABABABLAB (**Loads Lmg with religious intent** better grab the ball fillthy casuals)
---
I mean I have a power 8 lean and he is rank 1 is that any good
---
I remember I actually stopped playing for a bit, since in literally every mode I would be in matches with 2-3 Rosas in like 500+ trophy range, and I didn‚Äôt want to play Rosas because 1v1‚Äôs came down to level mostly, and my Tosa was really low lvl.
---
Your post has been removed, make sure to use the body of a post to elaborate on the title.
---
What are they planning on levels iam personally at lv140 and I see no use in leveling up! Some rewards would be cool especially gems cuz your game is been played almost by F2P players...
---
I saved 400 boxes and 4 mega boxes from trophie road before Sandy and I still haven't unlocked Sandy...
---
haahah lovely
---
Out of 3 brawler, one is a carrier, one is the support of the carrier, and one can be the aggressive player to push back enemy. This is one strategy or we can use lanewise attack strategy with each brawler in each lane and one or max two will carry gems.
---
If bakesale barely is so rare I‚Äôm glad to have it on my mini

Don't expect a brawl talk coming a random day without Ryan posting a photo on Twitter the day before of the actual brawl talk launch

Sorry, your post has been removed. You need an account that's at least 7 days old to make a submission here.
---
The problem is, the piper usually has super, you see.
---
We arent getting a New brawl talk toda until Ryan post a photo before recording it, showing up that they will release it the following Day. So if the update would come in the 12th we have two possible options: tomorrow (the most possible, and the Day after release the update) or on thursday (global launch birthday, this would be very un usual to happen but maybe they will release the brawl talk and the update the same Day as they did with the "mini update"

For you, sir, there is a special and painful place in hell.

It's actually gem grab

Idk i just found a nice photo of piper

But for real it's not too often that you'll find ANYONE  who you can rely on
---
If these skins will be this brawlidays,because last winter the have mark "brawlidays 2019"
---
*Running, hiding, and power cube theft
---
You should've done the other hand
---
They mean aiming at other players
---
so he killed crow too
---
Please don't eat him!!
---
Yep, so lets not complain about it so those people lose trophies and we gain them
---
Mortis coming soon!! &lt;3
---
Oh that makes sense
---
I also asked in a Q&amp;A 9 months ago. Frank replied: ‚ÄòThe brawliday skins will return next christmas along with a few more festive skins‚Äô. I asked if the same thing will be done with Lunar New Year. He said: ‚Äòyes‚Äô.
---
It either their ok or so bad that it makes jumping of a cliff sound good
---
Padoru Padoru
---
ItS iN mY pOcKeT
---
Not just the artstyle, his mindset 
---
Seriously, just needs a pinch of LOUD to achieve perfection
---
In addition, coiled snake is almost always better than creepy harvest; mortis (no attacks left) is still just as vulnerable after a kill and the super recovers health anyways making it redundant.
---
Now THAT is relatable to me LOL
---
(Except when I use crow XD)
---
Oh now I read title
---
Ouch, I honestly never attack people in lone star, I think the boys are the ones who always try to get that one powercubes from me.
---
Cool idea!
---
8th post I‚Äôve seen about this today
---
Yeah, that's what I did with my Poco, too. I just hide. When someone comes my way, and I know they will see me for sure, I fire away, but not onto them, so they will go away, not knowing that I was only Power 1. On the rare occasion they do find out, I'm dead. They just rush towards you, cuz they can tank at least 10 shots from you.
---
Thank you :)
---
Maybe but the very small brawl talk for the very small update was easy to do
---
Yes, Christmas skins for dinamike and penny cost 80 gems(despite the discount) and christmas skin for nita cost 150 gems( despite the discount)
---
Thanks a lot..
---
I hate Morti so much, they say that they kill thrower teams but all they do is flee from everything and everyone and team if necessary to get high placement.
---
Hey you found it!
---
Nita Dynamike and Colt
---
AND SHELLY
---
Im not f2p
---
You're team is ok with randoms but the other have a party of three trained for hours and are ready to fecking destroy
---
I‚Äôve never played Siege before the change but its current form
---
Is easily my least favorite game mode.
---
Really? It's cool, so we need just to wait for update
---
69th upvote :*)
---
Ok
---
I used Zbrush and Photoshop...
---
Thanks :)
---
Yeah, like Darryls do it, too.
---
I play him just on brawl ball, he is bad on showdown if he do not team...
---
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been telling everyone to do, but apparently everyone is inpatient.
---
Yeah
---
Everything is mostly right, except Colt and Leon.
---
You have no idea how bad leon and rosa were
---
Well my friend is my nephew so i don't care for the 100 trphies + he is having so much fun playing together!
---
I feel the discounts will be out again this year too cuz just watched OJ's vid and the shop offers even the developer built had offers straight in the shop so I believe I can get Mike for 59
---
I envy u
---
And how would you know that m. They deleted a lot of their videos and this always happens before  a Brawl talk happens
---
An Uncle's gift to his niece.

It needs a nerf anyway. A star power being OP is not a reason not to fix a consistency issue.

oh, I'm sorry

It‚Äôs not about healthy living or whatever. It‚Äôs to prevent burnout which causes a lot of people to walk away from games. This makes it so it‚Äôs a lot harder to get burnt out from the game and so you keep wanting to play Everyday. Trust me supercell doesn‚Äôt care about your health.

I wished this was true. The ladder reset is way too large and forces any 17k+ trophies player to play 20+ hours a week just to STAY at the same level. Skill stops being a wall, and time becomes the wall, which is shameful.
---
I think this should be changed ASAP.
---
Oh absolutely, I wasn‚Äôt referring to trophy grinding. That aspect is horrid and I just hover and horse around in the 16/17k range. But the token side of it is what I meant.

The reason that there is no report button is because people wil use it every tume they lose a battle and than someone need to controle if it is right that they are banned and supercell knows that and they don't want to use money to do that

The update is dropping on Thursday (12th), or maybe later, but definitely this week, Frank said that they\`re putting the update out this week because most people want to go home to their families for Christmas, so that they still have time to patch some bugs and glitches. The brawl talk always comes out 1-3 days before the update. So the brawl talk is gonna be anytime from today (The 10th) to friday (The 13th), even though the latter is unlikely.

Me too

I think it would really be a nice addition to the game. Purposly trolling teammates, just in general not playing (well enough) according to the trophie range and toxic behavior should be reportable.

Yay,I can finally upgrade my 25+ BRAWLERS

I just LOVE making cards! And yes, I take suggestions, because I want to be as open as I can to my community. If I make my own card game, I'll make sure to make a Card Maker directly in the game! That's the thing most card games are missing. I don't even know one that has a Card Maker in, tbh.

This is creepy af. I'm gonna have +1 nightmare tonight

u/vredditdownloader
---
Happy to see I am not the only one thinking this way! When I play with one of my friend, everything is cool. But if we add a third friend, it becomes so hard!!! Like if we play with 500 trophies brawlers, our opponents could be all level 10 600 - 700. I think SC definitely make matchmaking harder when you have a team.

That must be because when people search Brawl Stars they open those videos, not the channel. And when searching Brawl talk, they open the channel, knowing they will get what they want there

Good point, but still. I think they need simenthing. It takes so much time to get one. I am over 13k and still don't have one üò∞üò®
---
Thank you &lt;3, yeah I feel like is missing some walls, but at the same time I don't know where to put it without making _snipers/long range in general_ unfeasible
---
Not ANYMORE BRAWL TALKS FOR YOU-hope you will make a meme about that
---
Um how old are you?
---
Oh wow thats alot :v
---
Whoops, didn't notice
---
Hey 4 is a high number..
---
Bruh bruh bruh,,,, bruh bruh ????
---
It's your decision, but you should save gems for the exclusive skins in christmas
---
Yess pleasee üò°üò°üò°
---
How is this salty you dumbass he's giving his opinion like normal people do, you're clearly the salty one here for making a big deal out of it.
---
Its super but its more ICE GOLEMISH than PRIMOISH
---
22..... I said cute.... I don't have any intention to make her my gf
---
Oh wait you have a Lot of gems, but i think there will be other discounts after this
---
Money or the brawltalk  dies
---
i love the game mode, I that is 3  3
---
Sorry that was my wrong
---
Yes, but i thought this would be better here?!
---
how much trophies are you?
---
No it is if you are afk in a game for a bit longer
---
Meteor rush &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;el fuego i have the starpowers
---
13.2k ://
---
Do you know the muffin man?
---
Start by getting everyone to rank 21, if you have all brawlers then it will be easier to come out of reset with more trophies, also if you want trophies its best to push everyone instead of a few
---
Yes I am already used to this type of leak I know it is false more my heart wants it to be true I am mistaken more I think some things may be true other not

Rule 5. Repetitive or low effort posts with a low discussion potential will be removed.

I don't know i am very lucky for gems but not for legendaries.
---
I'm only 13 and I don't have a job :/
---
"Your game is amazing"
---
#1 STAR
---
I cant choose between r/okbrawlerretard and r/shittybrawlstars, please help me!!!!!
---
No not really tbh, i have 3 legendaries on my main, a good amount of star powers and 1 star power on my mini.
---
Very low chance
---
More rare then a legendary
---
Ice
---
Ty
---
20 gems: OHH!!!
---
that's why you haven't seen Emerick's channel
---
He used a thumbnail with a monk from a brawler concept and the title said something like "the best brawler" or something
---
Good job! He is the last brawler that i need
---
I bet showdown will be a fuckfest all the same brawler after update.
---
You literally have negative gems, which means you bought and refunded... so sad
---
And it would Explode if you throw a banana at your phone
---
How... How did this get 100+ upvotes?
---
DKMAYU

Damn it üòî

It's solo VS 7

---
But the bruh bruh bruh bruh
---
This is genuinely one of the few times this sub had made me laugh.
---
Top right and bottom left - as far as i remember, there use to have little road at edge of map..
---
Bottom - there are "wall maze" before.. They replace it with water + wall..
---
this is good cause its free lol
---
poco should be in B tier and frank on D tier cause everything in the game counters frank and nita is A tier
---
8000 factorial with only 1 epic? Damn you must have every other brawler at rank 100
---
It hurt my eyes
---
Yeah sure
---
You know what they say, with HIV comes AIDS
---
so you didn't get spike
---
I was 10 when COC was released
---
Spicy as me
---
danger zone completed the trio
---
I mean you tried to take things in your own hands instead of letting supercell fix it. You probably violated the ToS. So you get what you get man, sorry to say it but unless supercell decided to unban you‚Äôre account then you‚Äôre not getting it back.
---
Nice.
---
Not from that box
---
what about a brawl talk with no update
---
Rule 2. All contents must be directly related to Brawl Stars.
---
you mean fence maze?
---
Line is making these billboards
---
Yes
---
Impossible
---
No uses a SpiuK para tus perras mamadas
---
Damn i thought it was "for Buena for glory"
---
And probably consider looking how many 3v3 wins they have, 3000 wins should be good
---
There is no strategy. Eventually you'll get every brawler in the game (except maybe legendaries), so it depends on your priorities. I would hang on to those boxes till every update, since you'll probably have to wait a month anyway to pull a starpower, and upgrading makes barely any difference.
---
We know how the dev team feel now
---
I sense..
---
ANIME HAIR! :D
---
Aww shit, my max is at 15k ;-;
---
Nice artwork btw :)
---
Piper and brock invasion
---
I don't have star power and my Mortis has on 500
---
#BUT NOBODY CARES
---
I can't see the problem.
---
I hate u
---
I like how the skin icon just says GINGER
---
That is what whappens to me when i play lonestar or takedown
---
Shelly: IT IS... requiem
---
I know
---
She looks like a cat
---
Gonna bring her some Whiskas
---
Igen
---
getting 650 or 7 is about as hard as it was to get 500 before the change I feel
---
Tokyo ghoul type shit I like it
---
Already delete unused apps, unwanted pic + music, clear all cache and have more than (minimum) 5G empty space..?
---
all possible Brawler fusions were already made by dandeleyon.

I personally think on Thursday we may not get a Brawl Talk, but just a gift of some kind, BT can get released later
---
Just because you got mad at a guy that kind of said the truth you are now posting it to everyone so they can hate on him. Shame on you.
---
"### ROBO MIKE?"
---
Ok thank you
---
Whenever I play Power Play (especially late in the season) my hands get buttery af
---
Sorry, I thought she got 2 supers off during your second fight, my bad. That doesn't help your case...5 supers in almost a minute instead of in 30 seconds. So broken
---
Same
---
I have that too.
---
Nah we‚Äôre just all poor
---
Neefing the og brawler doesn‚Äôt make at sense, also without her super Shelly is literally nothing.
---
You'll take the fattest L ever if no new Brawler is released in the update
---
Epiiiiiic
---
AY Ay*
---
What phones r u using? Iv tried BS on a Nokia 5 (¬£80) and sweaty hands weren't a problem. On my Honor 20 (¬£400) sweaty hands also aren't an issue and performance is great. I recommend upgrading your phone if your in a situation where you can do so.
---
*behind the scene person spectating themselves*
---
Was on a Samsung s8 than upgraded to a s10 a couple of weeks ago
---
brock is ADY
---
Brawl talk should be on the 18th if anyone is wondering...
---
The legend you speak of has been confirmed to  hold an accurate account of the events that occurred
---
Why did you just stole that clip?
---
Rio you are cool as always üòéüëå
---
I didn't believe because I got sandy a week ago at ~ 127800
---
Stolen
---
So... Nobody want to talk about "Water Leaking/ Water Hole at his hand"?
---
SnEaKy TiMe!!
---
Great skin, the bad thing is that you can only attack the structures
---
#SHUT UP! YOU'LL BETTER TO SHOW UP UNDER STOLEN ARTWORKS!
---
But why not?
---
I'd love to get star powers
---
taked me 10x your trophies to get him, at 5.8k
---
Two things:
---
1.) r/Youbrokethechain
---
2.) The better question is "Why not?"
---
Darryl's Super charges automaticly, the bones always do this, and Darryl's movement is just stepping....
---
So, you are wrong, this is a real photo
---
Well done
---
Sorry but i feels like my mouth full of food when i read this SS XD
---
Lol nice poem
---
Maybe learn your grammar first mate
---
If you really leave, let someone get your account
---
It‚Äôs not ay yai though
---
Cursed image
---
It‚Äôs not rare at all, there were tens of millions of people playing last Christmas. Get over yourself.
---
This legitimately makes me sad: I created a new brawler with stats, and even like 20 voicelines. It gets 80 upvotes. Someone just took an image and adds a text bubble. Almost 4 times more upvotes. I need feedback so I can actually improve it. :/
---
You know this is a 10 year old song
---
You‚Äôre obviously a child so I won‚Äôt say anything further, except don‚Äôt act like a little prick on the internet.
---
that when you are afk for long time or when you went afk and you recconect much times
---
Ummm i dont remember brawl stars having....you know
---
That Rosa is for sure hacking
---
*UNLEADED
---
and no, its not new
---
Lol I was just thinking about this
---
She's from the desert trio :D maybe i'll do them next
---
This is the best fcking skin I‚Äôve ever seen
---
And for some reason in 3ve the matchmaking (at least for me) is stuck on 2/6. And when a new brawler comes out, it's literally impossible to play any 3v3 gamemode because of this.
---
Know it has been in the game for a while. If you log out of the battle twice it will fully kick you out until the battle finishes
---
And do nothing
---
Looks neat! I like the ‚Äúpolygon-ish‚Äù style you‚Äôre going with this, but I have two critiques
---
1) It needs some stronger outlining. Give it some stronger, thicker outlines to give it a more *bold* look.
---
2) The colors look bland, and it looks too bright. Put some more contrast in the colors, give the colors a more richer color.
---
I feel you bud I'm same but only got sandy at 18000 all maxed just need coins
---
Isn‚Äôt that every brawl stars youtuber tho except for the underrated pro players and kairos?
---
1/6 layers found
---
xd but when you search "brawl stars official" you will find it bruh i think only me know that
---
Stop with ads
---
His?
---
Yep, and not believing it, sometimes I think this community is toxic and bad
---
The fuck that is ram you idiot. Maybe at least get that right before posting
---
Yeah, Morti NEVER team in showdown. They are the true heroes that heroically flee from everything and everyone to get high placement. The true heroes :/
---
Imagine not having Mortis as S-tier.
---
That to me before
---
its in baby yoda's heac
---
I mean I do agree with this statement, but that doesn‚Äôt justify the thousands of kids getting all crazy in the comments.
