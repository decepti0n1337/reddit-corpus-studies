---
---
Finally, a good ship. 
---
PROS:
---

---
3D Maps
---
A new brawler (despite how broken they are)
---
Most of the various changes.
---
CONS:
---
The UI still needs some work, Im not really sure why it had to change at all but right now it is still a bit unintuitive.
---
Respawn System, in duos the respawn system is a bit broken.
---
Extreme Generalization, I understand that for the sake of the game, it had to be done, but now the game has lost almost all its character imo, I think some of the theme should be added back.
---
Thats normal lol
---
This is a really cool art style!
---
We will get 3 New Brawlers I hope...
---
it could be adjusted so poco pam &amp; leon arent worthless
---
[removed]
---
O ok im only 2k trophies and my first seeing this. 
---
So?
---
Kinda looks like Hitler‚Äôs mustache 
---
mmm
---
This comes from another meme where bull or El primo rushes into the opponent's spawn area with all 10 gems and dies. In this meme bull or El primo thinks they have 10 power ups and can take out the whole other team lol. 
---
Theyre fairly easy to get until legendary
---
200
---
Buying Legendaries for coins, it could be a ridiculous amount, like 1million, but having to wait like 1.5 years for a brawler is even more ridiculous.
---
I was wondering how I could prove I wasn‚Äôt reusing screenshots, but friends online and tara being lvl 2 were good ways of it
---
I've got to ask but how do you make these? 
---
The matches would finish in 30 seconds, it wouldn‚Äôt be funny, just annoying
---
Notification!
---
Yes 
---
[This](https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/ah3lov/mast_importantly_math_class_paper_background/?st=JR4439I2&amp;sh=f4168613)  is what I mean
---
same üòÅ
---
I know that I play cr too lmao
---
No offense, but how do you suck at using Bull? All you have to do is find a bush and wait
---
Before they fixed the matchmaking (more than one year ago), at high trophies level you could find double brawlers too. I just had a match with 3 pipers in my team (we lost however)
---
Some people had 3 jessies against 3 jessies in a real match. Guess who won
---
The jessie team won
---
Silex? More like shellex.
---
No one plays dyna in big boss
---
But it‚Äôs basically a 2v3 at that point...
---
He was sarcasm 
---
Actually, Mortis is a very auto aim friendly character outside of brawl ball. If you can get close to a relatively low health brawler, you can just spam auto aim to quickly kill them. 
---
I honestly prefer the skins a bit more, this game is so much better balanced than clash royal, (I came from there, and I also buy skins). It's not so bad even playing with the worst brawlers. But yes, I can't wait for the balance update.
---
My intention was not to make the game politically correct adding another race to the cast, I wanted to create a cool character and thought a migrant worker would‚Äôve been a cool base (this was a common thing throughout much of American history). And there is nothing wrong with making a game more politically correct as long as we aren‚Äôt trying to force it.
---
TL:DR I made him Chinese to add flair, not to force diversity.
---
There's nothing wrong with that really. 
---
same thing happened to me 
---
Ok so I confirm, this idea is brilliant! A support buffer will be a nice add
---
If u don't wanna team, just betray and acquire more power cubes  (‚Ä¢ _‚Ä¢)`\
---
the leon nerf we need supercell!
---
It means Run 
---
What? That‚Äôs perfect 
---
Thank you! I don't usually do lineless, but I wanted to do something different as a warmup ü§ó
---
Crow for sure 
---
Its him!! Sans brawl stars!
---
Thats enough of my phone today, time to go outside and forget this
---
Y u cry 4?
---
I mean I do this a lot but the difference is there‚Äôs a bull nearby and I know if I try to pick that power up he‚Äôs going to obliterate me so I just move right along.
---
Exsists

Crow and dying
---
My first tips post image
---
Yep already up to 20 trophies and haven't lost too much yet /s
---
Are you free to play
---
Step 5: Profit
---
Star power shelly would be a mess. Barley too.
---
Upvote if you laughed or anything like that or if you thought this was the old fortnite lobbyüòÇ
---
Are you making this in Photoshop?
---
Well, I personally enjoy this so called ‚Äúgame‚Äù.
---
Sorry.
---
NNN all over again 
---
Tell me when you make jessie please
---
!remind april 9
---
Is someone upset because the $2 they spent didn‚Äôt instantly earn them the top spot in the world?
---
If supercell copies anyone for Leon, they copied teenage edgelords 
---
i mean you can get some wins here and there too tho
---
one time i was just farming boxes in the outskirts of the map and then all of a sudden, BAM SHOWDOWN BABY. then who do i see? A Shelly with no super
---
Sounds perfect
---
Throwers don't whack
---
REPOSTED
---
Imo this might crowd the UI, and there‚Äôs not much you can do about where your teammates shoot anyways. (And at lower ranks it‚Äôs pretty much autoaim)
---
What
---
Mortis
---
It‚Äôs a joke
---
Turns out she is giving the middle finger bc she puts her turret down and Pam spam heals
---
Holy! I‚Äôve got 11.1k with 2700 3v3 wins, that player is crazy
---
Wtf is this lmao I kinda love it
---
Yup me too, the dynamike and Jessie actually was asleep for about 1 min before I decided t record, and then they woke up!
---
Unfortunately, an accurate visual would only tell you what they were pointing at about half a second ago. A lot of work is done on multiplayer games like this to hide the time lag between players and the server, and this would make it harder to disguise.
---
lel
---
1. You always need a tank in heist.
---
2. You lost to a pam in heist 
---
3. You lost as a leon this is unheard of 
---
Anxiety is telling me that map is cavern churn and my trophy count is about to be dunked on...

Ha what a dumbass
---
The magic archer not found hit me in the feels

Congrats!
---
Is Bill a new Bull skin? Office clerk, Bill. 
---
You play with randoms that‚Äôs the mistake
---
you got a typo in the title :)
---
F
---
Any tips on getting trophies and or what to spend gems on?
---
Na it was trash, didn‚Äôt feel like gem grab
---
Mortis better at bball
---
both sound pretty good I can see them doing what you said and locking it
---
I must have missed this rework! I started trying Darryl out again aware that his super was shorter, but I didn‚Äôt realize he was so squishy and unable to finish a kill! What even is his role anymore? (Pun intended) he used to be a double shot tank, who would lose to bull but could beat most other options. His max HP is 5600? With the other buffs to Jessie and Penny, he is way too easy to assassinate if he was a tank. Is he some mistake for a gem carrier? Or a weird and highly inferior mortis who speeds up and takes people out in showdown? With no supers, he even loses to Shelly. 
---
TL;DR I think Darryl sucks, but what is his role?
---
Holy shit finally a smart player
---
Chief this is it
---
Rip crow
---
REE 
---
Nope. She‚Äôs more well rounded for the mode. Besides, the pros say she‚Äôs the top as well. 
---
What is that blue dragon in top corner? I don't remember that from clash?
---
Yeah it used to be even worse, and sometimes it would be stuck until overtime when the walls get destroyed 
---
So unique!!
---
Wheres goldilocks?
---
I ate those brawler.
---
And what account would that be?
---
r/BrawlRecruit
---
Nazi
---
tara + frank  + spike. no way I got this wrong
---
What for?
---
I like how Colt is still facing over his shoulder, did anyone else get that? 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Select Colt, start rotating him, and then try to find a reasonable position. If you look at him from where his face should be pointing, he's looking behind him. Apparently has trust issues.
---
Fancy background
---
Yes. I doesn‚Äôt matter which brawler your playing or what lvl they are. If you knew how to play the game, you would use brawlers that would work well on a map and also which brawlers to target and leave alone. (Git Gud)
---
Primo should have been ‚ÄúyEeT‚Äù
---
It‚Äôs mama J (OGs will remember this)
---
Throws lasagna
---
No hoovys in game tho
---
I forgot its bin a 8 months I forgot.
---
Can you actually change the background? How did you do that?
---
Spike lol
---
*Laughs in Shelley super
---
Can you do one for Crow as well
---
I saw that in the US too
---
Mortis voice
---
Someone‚Äôs fishing 
---
Well, I see that you figured it out :)
---

---
I'm super interested in this Bill character!
---
I main Kirby man 
---
Too late lol 
---
Flair is discussion btw
---
Hit and runner. Good at life leech
---
I literally responded in the same minute you posted it. You just wasted $10
---
If you were going to spend $10 should‚Äôve spent it on token doublers and tickets
---
It's the same map without some errors!
---
Well, don't play them then. Poco and Piper are also weak in Heist. No one plays them there.
---
She is really annoying . But when i am the Boss i like it
---
Nothing but Bulls.
---
Maybe have the paint smaller and more under her eyes. They look more like whiskers like this
---
Look Leon right..... there
---
Cactus dodging skills
---
Pam‚Äôs turret = heal
---
It happened to me often before the most recent maintenance, I thought they fixed it then. 
---
If that happens, just restart the game.
---
Nice. 
---
Spike's brothers

Nice job! üëå

*Piper hops around*
---
For getting trophies it‚Äôs easy, you must only find a nice team and the match are easy for example in gems. The gems are very important, for me the best use for the gems is for skin, i love it.. but if you want to upgrade the brawler, you must buy tickets and double-coins
---
YESSS
---
Thanks for being the scumbag of the world
---
I tried brock and mortis when the were 1lvl...impossible

You forgot el primo vs mega knight, crow vs poison, and piper vs flying machine
---
Does Pam‚Äôs heal scale with her hp? Never had to fight one as a big boss yet.

Wouldn't Tencent also be controlling Supercell as they did bought Supercell?

No! It‚Äôs okay because I kill them after!

Crow would be OP. Shelly would be OP. Spike would be OP. The rest would suck.

Looks like a nice background photo! Great work!

Now hear this: I started playing a few days after global release, on the 15th I believe. On New Years Day, I got Mortis. A week ago exactly, I pulled Leon from a Brawl Box. And then two days ago, I pulled Pam from a Big Box. Yesterday, I pulled Tara from a Brawl Box.
---
I‚Äôm F2P and I have 18/22 Brawlers (missing Frank, Piper, Spike, and Crow)
---
Because I pulled all those Brawlers early, I was able to push up to Bo yesterday fairly easily, and it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm playing around the clock or anything. I missed almost a week of playing from the day after to Christmas to New Years Eve.
---
I truly believe that Supercell is handing me this game for stiffing me cold in Clash Royale (4000 trophies before I got my first legendary, Sparky).
---
what
---
Like in the servers on Minecraft xdxd
---
Last time boss game was out I had 20 tickets and wasted all of them trying to test Pam out as boss.  Didn‚Äôt get it once, FeelsBadMan
---
Bull disagrees
---
Not necessarily, proper strafing makes him viable, but it‚Äôs a wide skill gap
---
Brawl stars prioritises fast matchmaking over good matchmaking, so you just gotta chill and accept it.
---
Yeah i also thought About that
---
Level's don't affect matchmaking.
---
That Jessie doesn‚Äôt even have her star power xD
---
so how many trophies does 4th gain/loose?

Lol i auto aim with ricochet
---
This post is sponsored by mortis gang.
---
Then don't get close lol. When you learn his range and learn how to bush-check, it becomes a lot easier.
---
But its funnier to feel bad for the brock, stop using logic
---
Actually, manual aiming, moving in the same direction as your enemy, and effective bush hiding and wall use are all important parts of using el primo.
---
Love this one! Upvote
---
Bd eould be proud
---
When you are a weak ass birb so you can't go for kills anyways
---
I know it's not the main focus but my favourite part is the bear
---
Is there a secret transformation where you transform from el primo to shelly? 
---
Man we are the same person I‚Äôm at 3.4k and the same brawlers as you dude its unlucky 
---
Im blonde dont tell me what to do
---
charge the damn phone, immediately.
---
Yes it is. I recreated it on Call of Duty.
---
Nice!
---
'El primo'
---
It asks you to confirm the changes... 3 different times.
---
I just played the Boss with Brock, works pretty good. Normal attack is really strong and Super kills everyone
---
They need to nerf jessie and nita‚Äôs spawnables
---
Disrespect Nita again and see what happens
---
Mine was nita
---
Leon's getting wrecked that's what i like
---
Canyon treasure v.1: https://crux.page.link/8Pov
---
Im actually saving my gems for this hope they will recognize this art!
---
Step 9: do it with jessie. And reach 3+ minutes
---
I got a suicidal close range wannabe Piper and a ******* Primo on this map...
---
I dont know what to say
---
Their overall kills were around 2
---
If it's just 1vs1 auto aim is fine 
---
I almost thought it was a bot
---
Calculated right into a waiting shelly super
---
I bit his super is throwing Nita. 
---
Not complicated at all. Each season lasts 2 weeks and depending on which league u are in, u will get a certain amount of tokens. If u have any brawlers above 500 trophies, on each season reset, the amount of trophies above 500 will be halved. So 550 goes to 525, 800 goes to 650, etc
---
It is repost. I couldn't see the first one  on the mobile menu..Is it going to be a problem??üò•
---
üòÑüòÑüòÑ Thank you!
---
not really
---
Everybody gangsta til the turret starts walkin
---
I'm glad you like it! üòâ
---
Omfg same I‚Äôm still so mad to this day 
---
Nah make it that you still have to charge up your super but the regular attack doesn‚Äôt do any damage
---
And colt?
---
When a skilled people (not like this) can use cot, than one of the most op brawler
---
Thank you very muchüòÑüòÑüòÑ

Yes, thanks a lot!üòç

Come on man, Penny is a kid!

That‚Äôs what he said. Glad he took my advice lol.

I played a match where I had a Shelly in my team and she never woke up. The entire enemy team was after our blood, and only me and a Piper were fighting back.
---
We won that match.

Yup
---
Search on youtube: how to play with mortis

When you learned, you will play better with it

So what Nita meant by ur dad is she was trying to tell Jessie how Bull is fat since Bull is Jessies dad..

They won't add it cus Nintendo and brawl Stas won't prob ever do a collab and if they add the skins,  Nintendo can copyright strike them. 
---
Tara? 
---
It‚Äôs porn right?
---
Shhh,delete this. 
---
Supercell wants money
---
You want a new brawler
---
What do you want to do?
---
Most of it is, Yes. 
---
Glad it wasn't just me thinking that 
---
I hope you are
---
You can put Jessie's turret behind wall corner in sng map and even it will do much more work than randoms 
---
IF I HAD HIM
---
That face though 
---
One betray, everyone betrays
---
Yeah its annoying
---
Why does it matter? Star player on gem grab is due to kill count. I'm thankful when there's a tank that can grab the gems while I try to hold off the other team.

actually someone did it on shelly too...I WAS JUST LOOKING FOR FANARTS I SWEAR!!!but then a nude version of that fanart appeared in the feed...oh god the memories MAKE IT STOP

Heist?
---
Gg lucky for you :D
---
Sorry you had to deal with that! But on another note, how do you get the symbols by your name? 
---
Yeah, way too much teaming throwers at +300 trophies
---
You said it was yours?
---
The wall is there to add another role for players in the game, the wallbreaker. Bull, Primo, Colt, Brock, Frank and Dynamike are all viable for the task. To remove the wall is to remove the role, and  essentially lets Piper become the queen of it. So I wouldn't support this idea. 
---
Damage buff: He'd be a better assassin with a little more damage.
---
Health nerf: Being slightly squishier should make up for the damage buff.
---
Super: Knockback reduced so he can attack brawlers easier after hitting them with his super
---
Feel free to give any improvement or change ideas!
---
Penny is also disgusting as boss. But yea Jessie takes the crown xD 
---
Yeah I feel you
---
How does this reply relate to Jessie in big fight???
---
LMAO I LIKE HOW THE BROCK IN THE PIC IS AIMING AT NOTHING HAHAHA
---
Wow you lucky 
---
Sigh... 
---
Credit...
---
I also posted a suggestion about adding a reward for kills in solo and duo showdown. Like 1 trophy lee kill in solo, and 1 per team elimination on duo. That way when you kill 3 players and die in 7th place you actually gain 1 trophy instead of losing 2. This would encourage faster games as well as players to fight instead of hide, but wouldn‚Äôt stop the bully and Shelly‚Äôs and Darryl‚Äôs from winning either. Just adds a second dimension into the game.
---
Crow isn't the weakest he's great in the things he's supposed to do. 
---
see you on the front page
---
No, the amount of tickets don‚Äôt raise your chances.
---
Why tf is Darryl in F... Or Primo...
---
It‚Äôs certainly the far easier option
---
This is something that's only for the top 1% and doesn't even impact the game. I think Supercell has more important things to do than making sure you watch where your finger is.
---
fucking amazing
---

HOLY JESUS HOW DO YOU HAVE SO MUCH GOLD OH MY GOSH

Its been like 5 months to get spike and then almost immediately crow lol
---
One word T H I C C
---
when by friend started in global he actually thought that if u pick up gems in gem grab it transfers over in game
---
Looks like you had a hard time with nita 2.5hours? Thats a lot.
---
but he is good but weaker thang spike and leon because they are 2 the best and one of the best brawlers.
---
I think the safes are too near to each other 
---
That name though :3
---
Hasn't this been posted here before?
---
I think it‚Äôs more like a 1 in 6 chance, so every time you queue in, you have a 16.7% chance of being the big brawler
---
Damn the time go to sleep xD
---
What's the problem
---
Removed - DO NOT SUBMIT POSTS WITH TITLES IN ALL CAPS. CAPS LOCK IS CRUISE CONTROL FOR COOL

yes
---
My man!
---
What about a brawler like barley? That would be pretty broken
---
would be a nice map tbh
---
Same, I only have 1 epic and that's my rarest brawler
---
It's useless unless your account is completely maxed. Like people already said supercell has more to worry about.
---
I have it too! What colour is yours lol.

Is it a repost?

that simple?and he will join your cause?ok ill try.

How? I am over 4K trophies with only 15 brawlers. 
---
uM aCtuALly iTs LeVEl 100
---
But be careful, he can betray you... So, don't get too close if it is a strong brawler. And... of course, sometimes YOU can betray too...
---
Lucky you didn‚Äôt get wall destroying brawlers
---
Very wholesome! 
---
He's only viable in heist on certain maps. Otherwise he just sucks. 
---
Wait, where's Barley? Didn't he won? ü§î
---
I got 6 once
---
I think supercell  need to remove the skin from the store after just 1 day... I‚Äôm trying to buy Crow on the store but everyday i open the game i see Spicy Mike :/
---
and when you were playing in your mind its like "this guy doesnt even know how to play his character,did they just got them?,what a noob"

I mean why would u open a box if you already know you are going to get only gold it's just dumb to do so even by mistake. Don‚Äôt know i guess it's just my opinion.

It‚Äôs better than coins so be happy 
---
Dyna as boss or attacker?
---
maybe i wasnt familiar with that scale of teaming? i wasnt playing my best either, should i mention i was drunk also?
---
Exactly people like you who thrower team are scum they need to be band from game, ruins it completely 
---
1. Bull is good in heist. 
---
2. i don‚Äôt live in the us either. Brawl Stars has been in my country  out for a year
---
3. My mortis has 480 trophies Tilted with him.
---
4.  Is okay
---
I used to be just like you, only push in showdown but trust me the other modes are fun but always have a 3 person team when playing 3v3. And eventually you will all learn how each other play and have a pretty good experience. I played gem grab btw 
---
No one has said this yet, but I absolutely shred with penny on duo showdown on some maps. I got to rank 15 ( from at least 150 or more trophies lower) in one day. The enemy duos clump up a lot so your ability becomes a team killer. If you hit someone with the bag and 2 coins hit the person behind, then you do more damage as a sharpshooter than bull at point blank. And any maps with double chests allow you to get a lot of power cubes by angling it to get 2 or 3 coins to hit. 900 on on box and 2700 damage on another box is pretty insane. 
---
Mortis doesn‚Äôt need a buff and this is an English speaking subreddit.
---
Kk, I‚Äôm sold 
---
Thanks!
---
&gt;Brawl Stars has been in my country out for a year
---
that pretty much says it all. thanks for coming

i downloaded brawl stars 1 month ago
---
If u look at fortnite. Most of the OG players will have a skull trooper. We were happy cuz there was an exploit getting 13m on Robo Rumble but later when the game was released a new exploit came out
---
i downloaded brawl stars 10 months ago
---
Always look for the OG brawl stars players, never the noobie youtubers that think they are good after 10 lifeless years of clash gayale. I would recommend Coach Cory, though. He gives top tier gameplay videos.

Spike should get a Soccer Ball skin and throw Soccer Balls so that he blends in with the Brawl Ball one like he does with the Cactus obstacle.
---
I agree that having a premade is smart but what this post is saying is that he got matched up with a noob that only uses one brawler and it‚Äôs shelly.
---
Stay away from Shelly as Darryl. Im surprised you won that Primo...
---
He‚Äôs getting a new model and maybe a buff so maybe not so bad
---
üòÇ i won that game
---
It depends on the character but I say yes, solo showdown is the easiest. Im trying to get rank 15 on all my brawlers and I never would have gotten 300 trophies on Ricochet and Darryl if it wasnt for solo showdown. All I had to do was not engage and then get 3rd or 2nd nearly every game. Cavern Churn is a really good solo showdown map for almost every brawler, and no one checks the uppwr right corner so you can get like 3 free boxes sometimes
---
Not putting yourself in the middle of 4 people is a good start
---
Your internet connection is the problem
---
Fail
---
No.
---
I don't know if this counts but you can see some tips in r/BrawlStarsCompetitive
---
I‚Äôve seen a lot of Spanish here, too.
---
I bought the 35 level pack at 3k and got pam. Im at 4800 now without a new brawler. The luck system isnt broken, its just insignificant usually
---
Thank you twistedroyale!
---
True
---
Nice, didn‚Äôt know that was a thing. Thanks!
---
I‚Äôm 7
---
Penny I‚Äôve found to be amazing bc people group up and you can 2 shot the whole team down.
---
Well Penny is all growed up
---
This is epic
---
when you use comic sans
---
but yeah I agree once I played Pam on duo showdown (not sure which map) and got randomly paired with another Pam, then we got around 6-7 1st places in a row.
---
But like... Really bad luck....
---
I opened 2 mega boxes, and around 50 brawl boxes,
---
That's kind of what I'm thinking...
---
This is really nice! I can really see this art being one of the three winners. I can also see this as a poster for like a popular advertisement somewhere in Tokyo, and maybe even some Japanese fonts in front of it. 
---
Upvoted!
---
lol you tried to redo that succesful meme but failed.
---
When you lag in a game against BOTS you know something's wrong
---
Why the fuck lmao don't do that it's stupid
---
I'm almost sure Supercell fixed. They wouldn't let the bug there and just release the map again...
---
But it seems the same as before... Probably they did something that it doesn't envolve changing the map.
---
Haha!! Lol
---
totally normal
---
Good job man!
---
Yes i see they are woriing on it still, (no fixes) :/
---
Dude this is insane
---
I don‚Äôt understand why a pirate shoot her money I think that she is something of a bad pirate

Want to know what else is a number?
---
*911*
---
Being mike is hard to play with other morti on the field or being Mortis is hard vise versa?
---
Are you serious? Have you played other Supercell games? You're just making yourself look very ignorant right now. Obviously there will be bugs from time to time, and Supercell is known to fix them as fast as possible. Do you think they would purposefully delay an update? No. They want to release an update that is the best it can be, or else there will be more bugs. Also, Supercell games usually get updates once every few months, so I'm not sure why you're surprised there hasn't been an update within a month.
---
You can do that??
---
I bet your brawler chances are through the roof 
---
Lol the closest is 9 minutes
---
Thanks :D
---
But the chance of dropping something is still ten times more than from the mega correct me if I'm wrong
---
i just also got those 3 things on the left after winning solos with jessie!
---
S√≠
---
Oooo, good example. I wouldn't know how to solve that.
---
So I think both ways have a negative side. But I think total trophies based matchmaking have more negative points
---
any brawler can succeed in showdown until 350 lmfao 
---
Beter chage bull and leon 
---
ahaha yes
---
So good

I'm win

Darryl doesn‚Äôt need a buff

Yes. Perhaps soms more unranked maps or if there are more global players at 10k so you can match rooms with rooms and random teams with other randoms
---
Yeah, sorry
---
Darryl is garbo
---
Don't play with randoms?
---
Sometimes you just gotta team when you already see a team of 3 if you wanna not lose trophies 
---
Why I don‚Äôt know
---
Auto aim for dayzzz...( Don't act like you manual aim with heavy weights )
---
Btw if you don't have barley, you can get him for free by connecting your supercell id
---
ok I actually love that Frank has the 3 accounts with different funding on all 3, so he can understand what the game is like for every kind of player. what a legend 
---
exactly
---
That‚Äôs how Brawl Stars works
---
This is my favorite character and you did an amazing job!!! 
---
Or they're zero
---
Spike is Hitler now... 
---
Terrifying
---
Exactly...better bounty map than heist tbh
---
 because of people like you who support these companies the videogame industry is wrong.
---
I remind you that before the pay to win there were companies that made good games. But as you have no idea it's waste of time to argue with someone like you
---
Really? I didn‚Äôt know. I just got him and he feels really good with my play style, but gets squashed by heavier brawlers
---
I'm glad a fellow Pam understands
---
u/Frank_Supercell
---
dude you should feel good higher rank guys using low rank guys to climb up is pretty much the only hope to rank up in the cruel world of -4 on rank 13
---
It's happening to me lately, idk why. Server problems are a current thing on this game for what i've seen in other forums.
---
No u can as in our band are exactly same named Person. Also ‚ÄôUni‚Äô means in finnish sleep. So it‚Äôs finnish language.
---
Yes because mega box equals √ó10 regular boxes and boosts your luck factor by √ó10 speed as well.
---
That's because he isn't supposed to kill heavier brawlers
---
How do you play him?
---
This is pleasing to look at and warms my heart how fearless colt is in this
---
Actualy, I only used to play Solo. I'm trying to accustom with 3x3.
---
No, i'm not a new player. And i noticed that, it was a mistake playing only Showdown because after 10k would be too bad to push.
---
But yes, It would be good having more solo modes that aren't Showdown
---
the skeleton looks is god coz we already have robots in the game implying that theyre normal in the world of bs so making more poco like guys is a nice idea
---
So cute üíú
---
I have 7000 trophies without spending a cent, it's that not free enough?
---
Yeah, they won‚Äôt be distracted forever, but it should usually buy more than enough time to win the game. Sometimes 1 or 2 might stop following you, but that still gives you a really good edge. You can also pick on Dynamike or Barley which are heavily played in heist. Try it, you‚Äôd be surprised ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
---
You have about a 0.75% to get an Epic or Mythic brawler. The equivalent of 23 boxes doesn‚Äôt yield a good enough chance to get one. If this were 125-150 boxes, I‚Äôd say you were unlucky, but definitely not broken. 
---
You could open 1,000 boxes and get nothing. Or you could get all the remaining brawlers in the next 10 boxes. RNG is just like that. 
---
Rotfl I see it too now
---
I would love to see campaign mode 
---
true. they were probably doing this endlessly, and I know how dumb the matchmaking detects that. I had been playing with my little brother, who has roughly 500 trophies, and his brand new friend with roughly 30, meanwhile I‚Äôm using 300+ Bull and facing people with roughly 70-120. It was really kinda stupid. 
---
Man, I‚Äôm tired of these posts everyone already posted it so stop please
---
Bro just dont auto aim kid 
---
Yeh still wouldn‚Äôt recommend

You have not even read the thread and you're coming to defend your brainwashing. Beta player.

Can confirm. Got him to rank 20 at level 6
---
Clash Royale heavily depends on the levels and types of cards you use. This game is more skill based, since you have free control over your characters. You decide where you go and how you approach things. Yes, people with higher power levels should be stronger but they can be outplayed more easily than you could ever do in Clash Royale. 
---
True 
---
Its main win condition is its poison, which keeps Leon from recovering/advancing, so he gets less of a chance to charge super, and the poison will show Leon while invisible.
---
Definitely shouldn‚Äôt win in a 1v1, but of the brawlers available, it does an above average job at countering Leon.
---
I think it could be very high and competitive 
---
You're so funny
---
Once went 25 games without getting big brawler 
---
Repost, wow very üòé!
---
Wow man that‚Äôs pretty lucky

i still love them both

She usually does that in the game though lol
---
awwwwwwwwwww i love it!
---
Incredible. 
---
The problem is that not all brawlers must be good at all gamemodes, each gamemode has a meta as it needs different roles and some brawlers will have different mechanics that work better
---
Ok das lit. You deserve the top spot.
---
It is in-game literally...
---
Play with a team then. Thats what you get when you play with randoms
---
Before you saying that i suffered a brainwash, READ IT first.
---
1 -- You can play the game without spending nothing. It is Free :)
---
2 -- The Matchmaking is still bad because the game was released for global short time ago, not enough to have many players with all trophies ranks playing all the time and just as you said, the game didn't become popular enough as CR (Yes, i used your own argue against you)
---
3 -- Your only argues are about brainwash and Supercell fanboys, stop being ridiculous and argue correctly if you want to change people's opinions.
---
Yeah i bought it and i got crow from it.
---
No matter how much they nerf him he will still be OP, there is no way they will nerf his movement speed, projectile speed, melee dps, mid range dps, range of his attack, attack speed and invisibility all at the same time.
---
Is this a copypasta?
---
Where do i see that
---
No, like a month ago, the pic was completely different (and his english wasnt bad) 
---
Maybe Bo will get an actual chest now
---
THICC
---
Yes it is
---
I think it's pretty objective in the 99% of the case
---
Actually now that I think of it, any movement boosting attacks/supers are gonna drop the flag (example: Overwatch)
---
This is my favourite so far
---
Wouldnt if it be more fun if your not forced to use a specific brawler to win, and you can use any brawler and win? Just off pure skill?
---
It do be like that
---
This is brilliant 
---

It's a kinda a Bull and Shelly meta, they're good in a lot of things (and Leon is OP)
---
Nice headshot

Go to the shop and tap on a big or mega box, and then tap the question mark icon at the top left. This will let you see your chances for a single drop.

Bull should get a Grinch suit for next Christmas since he‚Äôs denying fun from everybody.

All tips for improving are greatly appreciated!
---
‚ÄúToo pretty for....‚Äù *bang*
---
It‚Äôs because of auto aim.
---
They didn‚Äôt need it
---
They got it
---
Now everyone plays them
---
sure, maybe in one or two rare scenarios. But this introduces clumping together as the primary strategy.
---
Humble brag
---
Too pretty for... *bang*
---
I didn‚Äôt know that was even possible to get this low in trophies with a brawler.... You can‚Äôt hit 0 right ?
---
That's part of the game. It's like the lottery. Yes, it's unfair, but that's what you get when you play. Don't expect to win every time. Eventually the luck turns around. They put a luck factor so your legendary odds are probably higher than theirs right now. Just be patient.
---
NOT THE FACE!
---
Nah. His base health is 4000, where brawlers like Mortis and Nita have 3800. You'll obviously get Nita and her upgrades sooner, so you're actually better off using Nita as a tank :)
---
W h y
---
So good! So good!
---
And with a while back do you mean yesterday? As it says the date right next to his foot.
---
WHY DID STORMY plains get rEMOVED??
---
Play Bull.  He can 3-shot the chests from the beginning.  Once you get 3 power ups, he can 2-shot the chests.  Then go find a bush to hide in and sneak attack people.
---
Dynamike Noises

The nita bear is adorable!

Just make them better. Why would u spend all that time just to get a single mega box. up there it should be multiple of them tbh.

Nah fam, looking good! üëçüèº
---
I mean if you‚Äôre getting stuck it‚Äôs generally going to be because of your skill level. I‚Äôve seen guys get power level 1 characters to 500+ trophies. While it may be true that some characters are easier to play than others, all of them can be mastered with enough practice and a sound strategy. If you‚Äôre having trouble with the brawlers you have I would suggest picking one out that you really want to learn and then searching YouTube or r/BrawlStarsCompetitve for a detailed guide to help you out.

You were also spinning too. Not saying that this isn't a problem but you definitely aren't helping.

It's a bug, it happens 1/10 games so it's really common. And supercell knows of this bug and will fix it with the next update. Just close your game and reopen it and everything will be fine

tbh, i have no idea what.... you are talking about?

Bruh that's  so wrong Lmao. Ur supposed to kill kill kill with ur brawler. If u managed to kill someone that guy is ur teamate

Very good man! I think you shouldn't use in-game assets, but this Art is really good anyway.

Probably because you picked Leon

Uhhm, when I saw Nita for the first time, I thought Nita is a boy and I still think that's true. Nita looks like a child from an Indian tribe or something similar. At this place people wear "tunics/dresses" (, even if they are males. Besides, Nita does not have boobs and wears long, dark red pants, just like boys. I'm sorry, but for me Nita is a cute bear-boy.

I wasn't playing as a bot. What happened was that I was playing with my teammate and we were getting a box then it just loaded up us into a match. It probably was a bot cause I suck at the game but I'm really confused on how we got into 2 matches at once.
---
Funny i actually got mortis by opening a random box :V
---
But good luck finding them
---
Of course, feel free to! :)
---
Cherry?
---
I don‚Äôt care this is really cute. Good job on the art
---
So you loaded into game one, then you lot kicked out while your bot was still in. You guys started another one while your boots finished the first one.
---
Nerf him attack damage as much as Dyrell and make him as slow as Pam. Then lower his super to 3 seconds. Lol then he would be in par with crow. Lol

yes, that is what theyre asking for genius...

I guess some salty Bull mains must have seen this post cause they down voted the post and like 2 of my replies lol.
