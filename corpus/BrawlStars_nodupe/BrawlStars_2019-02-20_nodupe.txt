I got a brawler up to 499 three times yesterday, it‚Äôs so annoying 
---
---
---
YES! FINALLY INDIVIDUAL TUTORIALS!
---
Cool 9/10
---
Nah man... Try and beat a mortis that has no delay, legit doesn‚Äôt matter who you play, u just can‚Äôt beat him.
---
Can you be more clear how this breaks the rule? I don‚Äôt get how this post with the same format: https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/asccm7/and_stay_down/?st=JSCEKA1V&amp;sh=85a6ef86, stays up yet mine with a different punchline gets removed.
---
Have you ever tried make a team with brasilians
---
What, do you mean the star power then yes, it is for maxed players.
---
*downvotes me* 
---
When the bull spam his ulti to run but he can't :(
---
game is more fun on top ladder, but you have to play hardcore and learn meta and stuff. if you play casual ofc its funnier vs noobs :)
---
This happens to me too pretty much I have to tell my teammate to camp in the corner of the map until 3 teams are left so we don‚Äôt lose trophies 
---
all of your art is so perfect i love it. clean lines, none of the clay colors bled into each other. amazing! 
---
Same idea...
---
Can‚Äôt a dynamike theoretically kill a mortis using star power though?

r/lootstars

Very cool
---
Well that's a screenshot "/
---

---
That could just be team repositioning. I don't see how it really is teaming
---
"Ah, this lamp will be a fine addition to my collection." Love the art!
---
Or they could tighten the drop rates for beginners a bit and take the game back to what it was when it first started - Be happy with what ya got 
---
What are you on about? Yes you can.
---
They were walking along with each other, not even trying to shoot or avoid each other

Hell yes!!
---
I was also thinking of making his star power for his bat and ball, but thought it might be better for him to have ome for a jet pack. It would have been called "homerun" and he would stun the player who was hit with the ball at max range, also causing a bit of damage.
---
You don't know how many times I tried to smash my phone or abuse it. 
---
Same. I have a lot of technical problems with Brawl Stars, but I love the game :).

Sure

But Shellys never miss, A U T O A I M 
---
Owen back at it again with the map ideas! Great as always!
---
r/ShellyGang
---
Thanks! This one I‚Äôm kind of iffy about just because of the amount of bushes, but I think it would be a really unique idea!
---
Idk if it's still possible but if you invite someone (you gotta be in a duo showdown room not trophie puhsing room idek what you wanna call it) and then move another person to the slot where you invited the person and the person you invited accept the invite BAMM 3 player team :)
---
For another customer and for glory
---
Lol
---
I‚Äôm at 10.5 without one....
---
Well, it caught the crow by surprise at the least. And 90 IQ is close to retarded. 
---
I‚Äôve done that before but I thought it was patched.
---
HOLY CRAP THIS IS AMAZING! Love it so much! Take my upvote and silver!

What does that have to do with the things I mentioned above?Also that's a terrible way of trying to roast someone,do not ever do it again.git gud lol
---
Maybe it is idk tbh
---
Thb if I bought an epic and it's a mythtic, I would be happy.
---
I wrote stats and it auto corrected, whoops
---
Its PURfect!
---
That sounds good. I was thinking in 1v1 situations...but that sounds helpful. I guess I prefer him to be more offensive since he‚Äôs an assassin...
---
lol i knew what the caption was before i saw it XD
---
Exactly
---
lmao
---
He looks like he had a bad trip! 
---
*yeets in creature of the night*
---
Yes, but his claim here is that it is impossible with 1 enemy but the parent denies that statement, so technically you are not contradicting his point as he doesn‚Äôt disagree with the circumstance you just pointed out (albeit I don‚Äôt think your point is contradicting or correcting him but rather just clarifying).

#HAHA GET IT BECAUSE HES I N V I S I B L E
---
‚ÄòBattleRoyaleTeam‚Äô is just Solo Showdown, nothing new
---
Technically his smoke attack shoots out of the lamp...
---
last hope. might as well try
---
he is just a moving power box for our amusement 
---
It‚Äôs called a flair. If you‚Äôre on mobile, go to the subreddit main page and click the 3 dots, then click ‚Äúchange user flair.‚Äù

Does the RC have health so u can shoot it and force it to detonate before it gets to u? If so, how much health does it have?
---
lol what if the crow jumped to early and gets killed by the shelly
---
They don't want team,they enter the team then leave im searching for someone to help
---
Hahaha
---
you got every single detail imaginable and also appears hyper realistic. I applaud you for you magnificent work (insert claps).
---
Don't see what the problem was, he grabbed you fair and square, you got hit, and he pulled you.
---
There It is

This is almost as good as therussianbadgers vigil cosplay

It's to prevent teaming
---
This was my original thought!
---
Thank you so much, I appreciate the support! :)
---
Jessie is just to precious
---
oh i would love a knight character in the game. cool concept. 
---
It took me a lot to get class 20, crow dies very easy.
---
reduce damage taken by 50%. keep attack and movement speed the same. Super duration 5 seconds. That should work considering darryl has a similar super.
---
Thank you so much dude! ;)
---
Reminds me of him, not saying u got your idea from that. Well made, i hope your brawler comes out.

**I WANT MY MOMMY**
---
Hers some bandaids
---
Agree
---
Also, i forgot the left bottom corner....
---
More ambient grass in the empty parts would make it a lot better in my opinion.
---
Seriously i don't get why people want a buff, the poison is already so annoying, half of those people don't even realize that crow doesn't need to be a glass cannon
---
is 60% ok? if not, 50% it is!
---
current Super duration is 7 seconds, but i gets a -2 wouldn't be too bad.
---
Will post another update tomorrow
---
or the day after that
---
There should be a maximum power cap for a specific trophy range. There are many people who have max brawlers in lower trophies and makes the game very difficult.
---
Ok sorry for using your face but I couldn't resist not making this üòÇüò¨
---
i know, i just forgot it.
---
How does that prevent teaming? And I‚Äôm also pretty sure I still saw it at lower levels but I‚Äôm not sure.
---
how is it not a tongue?
---
my calculations tell me leon isn't that good anymore
---
Nope that‚Äôs probably why it seemed dumb to me 
---
I honestly agree. His ability to safely poke at a distance while being able to use his speed to dodge shots makes him a strong brawler to me, not to mention his poison mechanic and versatile super (can be used offensively/defensively).
---
It was time for Thomas to leave. He had seen everything. 
---
God I miss seeing the new brawler animation 
---
I love it! St Patrick‚Äôs Day concept art gang!
---
Thanks
---
Buff on what then
---
50% 7 seconds doesnt sound bad. I love the overall brawler idea though!
---
Got mortis pretty recently too lol
---
oc it's the el primo
---
Thanks, never thought of it like that
---
You know peeps are whales when they coming up with box concepts lol. 
---
Auto-aiming throught the whole game.
---
*Out-played...*

If someone teams with a bull and there's like 4 other bulls they wont know who they teamed with

That's insane!

Maybe he just had a baby fetish. Don‚Äôt judge him

r/RicoGang
---
gene is the best because he has a cool super and he is nice to be in the game
---
bro ur rarted yes u can n00b
---
Oh yeah sure I was fucked and it's all because I gave up. If I didn't give up, mortis could have wiped everything and everyone out because he's so strong. Plus if I hadn't have "gave up" my team would have stood a chance too. Sure man bull is super balanced and there's nothing wrong with leon.  
---
xD u/adeptus_31 just guided me here ahahah
---
Only a net difference of one star level. That is very fair matchmaking, as trophies don‚Äôt give players any advantage in brawler strength or damage. Low quality post.
---
He does whine like one
---
Contrary to popular belief I ran into 3 bulls with 3 power cubes each teaming needles to say I got third place

I feel you man lately it keeps happening to me and it is getting annoying I also keep getting lag issues like crazy out m internet is working perfect I am really thinking about deleteing the game and stoping the grind like I can‚Äôt get out of the spot I am in my highest trophies is 5931 and I keep on lagging and getting frozen on the screen to the point where I was at 5821 trophies

What?

Hey, I‚Äôm surprised you found me in this 30 day old post lmao üòÇ

This was fantastic. I think this would be even better if you added more words to the video. Even if it's just filler words like "hmm".
---
I just scrolled a bit there is a post called "so this was fun" a picture of a end screen with one bull and 5 shellys.

I'm pretty sure it is based on a cat

You sure there ain‚Äôt any bulls behind the couch?

shelly spams super becuz she can stun bull

me too r/leongang

how did he forget to do &lt;c

I‚Äôve always thought of bender as Barley and Rico (Thico) as the Donbot.

The star power that gave him value is useless now :(

Cough cough I got leon in a free box (when I duos I was wasted by um leon)

Nicer than white crow
---
Love it! You should make it have text to speech as well.
---
Yeah he does match Barley in the alcohol aspect lol and Rico is definitely thicc enough to be Donbot. I just thought Rico‚Äôs threatening catchphrases matched Bender more 
---
Wdym by text to speech?
---
Thanks!
---
Probably the most cringe post
---
I prefer elixir from power cube looks nicer

Thanks everybody for comments!

That's not a meme (I think). That's just having fun.

One time when I started playing we went up against 3 Shelly‚Äôs.
---
You can see the chances for each rarity by going to the shop, scrolling to the mega and big boxes, clicking one of them, and clicking the blue ‚Äòi‚Äô in the top left of the pop-up screen
---
Yes of course. Having trophies just means time spent not skill. Because in the game you get free trophies for playing longer, not because you win or you did good or anything like that.
---
Yeah I get it's bad and my boys changed it to that at school when I let them play but I've ran into "seymourcocc" "hairyA55chaps" and literally "ass eater" and a couple more this week alone. These we're all higher level players too so yea

Yes, it happened

You're doing well enough with to get a brawler well over 500 while remaining in 7300 total trophies. Also, a maxed Legendary brawler is a strong indicator of at least a few other maxed brawlers.

I made something with it

Where do you guys get this stuff

I got him on my second account and i got mad
---
Isn't it obvious that such an open Map needs skill In long range? Tbf piper is not the best 
---
You choose your flair by going to "community options" (which is below "make a post") and selecting your brawler.
---
Pretty sure that's spike just standing still or maybe it's his cousin oh wait I see it that's a Leon nope it's primo definitely primo
---
Crow aswell
---
Basically Thiccochet‚Äôs dream map.
---
They never learn

Matchmaking. Your total trophies were around theirs. this is a perfectly reasonable match up. Try playing the #1 Gene in the world with a 4k on your team
---
His name is #BRUCE
---
Mecha in blue text
---
Use auto aim 
---
Once you get above 300 trophies for a brawler, you can't see others names in solo showdown. They're labeled as "???". So you can't team really unless you just randomly start spinning. Also don't team, fucking annoying
---
I feel ya everyone teams in me in solo or duo just to fuck my dynamike score down more in the negative 
---
He is not

Those are the crests sadly removed in the march 2018 update. There was one for each brawler for health attack and super

It‚Äôs not

No I did it on my phone

All health values must be divisible by 140 and damage values 28 so 5040 health and 1148 damage

It most likely is

Woah how I missed this, yes please!!
---
So you think matchmaking should be based on power level? Then why would I level up my brawlers then? I would have no incentive to level up brawlers until I get enough power points and gold to upgrade straight from 1 - 9. I would be better off staying level 1 and matched with level 1 brawlers.
---
In fact, I can be like 'hey I got to 500 trophies at level 1 look how pro I am' but in fact you just fought against level 1 like yourselves
---
Remind me to that spike template smiling
---
i always thought jessy looked derp, and shelly looked like mickey mouse
---
No, it's just that Canarys are especially sensitive to any poison in the air. The moment they get a whiff they panic and scream like a bomb went off. And to be fair. If you're not careful there might be
---
And how will we get this box?
---
You like suffer
---
4.4k All 23 brawlers what the heck
---
Absolutely should be based on power level lol. Mix with trophies but PL should be a priority. You're literally losing out 500+ damage per shot after 2 PLs and is just unfair. 
---
Its not fair to lose a match just because the enemy team has more power than you

yes you can by clicking the profile icon of the players, and you even can you send a link outside of the app to invite people as firends

It was obviously intentional as the Shelly suicided to do this
---
User Totushbala posted a concept for a new game mode a while ago.  Caravan: 4 vs 4, a caravan driving from A to B, one team attacks the caravan, one defends it. If it reaches point B, the defending team wins. 
---
I'd really enjoy this mode, so I made a map for it. I hope you like it.   
---
The caravan or carriage starts a the bottom left, and has to deliver important mail to the town ini the upper right corner. Hence the name Royal Mail.   
---
The defending team starts also at the bottom left, while the attacking team is split into two spawning zones. If you die you spawn at one of the ten respawn points (the stars on the map).     
---
 I'm not sure if the brawlers should spawn random on the map, or the defenders below and attackers above the river. What do you think?   
---
 How do you guys like this map?   
---
 Thanks Totushbala for this awesome concept. 
---
Obviously not. 
---
shes a hybrid üòè mixed of selena gomez and princess peach. Supercell knew what they were doing when they made piper.
---
I‚Äôm at 8.2k trophies does that make me the best CR player ever? 
---
Would have been a strange angle and probably messed up the timing. Also, because you could die before you spawned the Shelly
---
now looking at it, i cant remember why i played such an ugyl game for 1.5 years 
---
Amazing map, keep doing them!!!
---
This is the cutest thing I‚Äôve ever seen. I‚Äôm saying this as a 30yr old man

1 megabox is equivalent to 10 normal boxes. So better buy mega box, u get things on spot rather than playing and collecting
---
**E x p o s e d**
---
That‚Äôs probably a good idea. My Leon is power level 5 so I‚Äôll try to first get him up some levels.
---
What about the lvl 1 Darryl?
---
Cool idea, maybe where the towers would be?
---
Also, I think the bridges shouldn't be bushes. I totally see that 1 Shelly just bush camping them...
---

While it does say at the bottom, be sure to credit the original poster. But I 100% agree, really cool concept.
---
God, stop saying this shit.

They are just testing their servers, they will be available for everybody. Stop complaining

Tbh colt needs a buff in range

Level isn't used for matchmaking...
---
Gotta love how the icon in the bottom right corner obscures the username of the maker
---
If you do that that is completely fine. I‚Äôd say that is a smart choice. What I‚Äôm frustrated about are the people that are spinning on each other and are teaming the whole game of Showdown.
---

It can replace the coin reward at high trophies in trophy road with those boxes

i wanted to be like that i have 3800 trophies and don't have even an epic

Trophy count?

Oh yea I‚Äôm new to reddit but I really liked the concept sorry
---
What have you brought upon this cursed land
---
How about we add purple vests to every cactus
---
I have a baaaad feeling about this 
---
I wish I had to bear with 7 bulls at least they are not cheating. Its the permanent dinamyke pam crow bo alliance chasing you that bothers me. How are you supposed to not lose trophies when 4/7 remaining players are chasing you.
---
It doesn‚Äôt erase it, you just have to type the rest out!
---
Yep, these brawlers could not be played comfortably with lag. Brawlers Like Poco and Barley will be fine with lag. The rest of the brawlers can take a little bit of lag but you need to play a little cautiously.
---
thx, gonna be fun to this all the time.
---
outstanding move
---
Yes, incredibly lucky. I think the chance to get Spike after Leon was 0,001%. Getting the 3 on the same day and within 5 chests must be almost impossible. 
---
that's the best part as playing shelly people underestimate her a lot and chaining super is always fun :x
---
Yep sure! Why not?
---
OH HELL NAW
---
i wasn‚Äôt being sarcastic
---
Yea I don‚Äôt know how they got there brawler to 420 trophies
---
yeah sure
---
Crow on my birthday (January 11th) from a small box I think. Then I bought Gene out of desperation because I already had most gems saved up, but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll shop again. When I get tired of not finding anything I‚Äôll just switch back to playing TS4. I really just want an epic brawler lol :(
---
Maybe they are looking for the Showdown gas.
---
ÁâõÈÄº
---
i'll be sure to try and fix that!
---
Sorry, I'm more of an editor than an artist, my drawing skills are _terrible_!
---
Depends on the situation, my favorite brawler spike went from level 4 to 6, so in my head it was worth it.

Why didn't they put an option that we can select portrait or landscape ;-;?

Idk i tried that once, getting thibgs that easy that fast just made me bored real quick, that's just my opinion. I know they're a company the skins are great for making money fast and still leaving room for people to enjoy the game

Yeah he shoots one laser beam at a time he could be like the same shooting distance as crow 
---
Thanks man, it worked :)
---
Thank you :)
---
I have a couple of ideas for his super, which i don't really like:
---
-spin slash: like link in zelda, he spins with his sword out damaging all enemies near him and destroying walls
---
-a boomerang that can destroy walls
---
-he throws his sword in a straight line destroying walls and dealing _a lot of damage_
---
Also for his star power my idea was that when he is at full health or above x% his normal attack also shoots a little projectile, similar to spike's but it doesn't split and deals low damage
---

Sorry, there isn't a theme anymore üò¨üëå

As per usual, Tara has nothing.

Oh I‚Äôve seen u before in... Gem grab, maybe? Your name looks familiar

it‚Äôs stolen.
---
First time for me
---
they stole the art from Amino
---
I don‚Äôt know dude, he is still pretty op

That sucks

You know when someone going to kill you when they start to follow you 
---
Eeellllll primoooooo

The star player is only on the winning team that's why

Who was i

Amazing

it‚Äôd be more awesome if they didn‚Äôt steal it. But they did

unfortunately, they stole it off of amino

Aha :))))

Nita I think
---
To be continued... 
---
 I don't want bo to take nita 's mask. 
---
I see
---
I checked the maximum trophies of my brawlers on Brawl Stats and among all of them I lost over 200 cups lol 
---
So like a mix between heist and bounty
---
Its a money grab for low level accounts desperate for gold, not knowing how they screw you later.
---
I was missing 2 brawlers. (Bought 1 for gems) - and I have racked up 29 k gold, and haven't seen a new brawler drop, closing in towards a year... 
---
Bit kg changes E V E R Y thing
---
Sounds cool man!
---
This gold offer is better than the power points offer. With 450 gold you can buy 225 power point. Actual power points offer cust 10 more gems for 185 power points only. This offers are crazy.. I miss the double token offer that one was really good
---
Honestly I wish there was,  but I guess you're right...
---
 Even without a dead eagle, you can have an eagle's vision. Moreover, if he sees his opponent in the eye of the heart. 
---
That's not true lol
---
its not so hard to dodge one, but from exp if theres two of them, they will kill me by sorrounding me or if i keep running ill just run into another brawler and die anyways, at least thats what happens to me
---
I cant understand supercell. a lot of players that are new and have aroun 3k trophies already have 1 or 2 lengedaries, me as a beta player i still need piper frank and legendaries and have 9k 
---
I think a free box every day would be perfect ü§î
---
BEARV22
---
Yeah! When I first thought of it I figured it was a mix of cod SnD and heist. Or if you follow BO4 it's similar to control
---
good question, i cant really decide, probably Leon or Piper cause their pose :P ( Leon is an octoling though )
---
I got spike at 4.3k and crow at 4.6k and my cousin got Leon at 4.6k however I still don‚Äôt have Darryl. And the question should probably be what experience level they got a legendary at?
---
How do you have leon on your tag??? Plz tell me
---
It would work on pc, but on a mobile base where skill-based games are unheard of (and for good reason) it will tank BS' popularity.
---
&gt;U have got rad skills wow

thank you. i didn't know word "RAD". now i know because of you.

Please!

Go to brawlstars Reddit page click three buttons on right top corner click change flair

thanks alot for the kind words &lt;3 :\]

And that's why it's classed as a support, not an assassin.

Yep..English aint my native..Thanks...I aint pro either have played game for about 2 months(7600trophy 16brawler).. Tho i am not saying to make every map same! By versatile i meant, like double troble AND thousand lakes. They are good mapes. We don't use same tactics do we? Cavern churn is what i was  talking about to be exact. Few gem grab maps also overlaps.

I don't know, I personally really liked the eagles head. It would allow for some really awesome skins in the future, like dragon hunter Bo, etc. Nice job otherwise.
---
i hate it actually , in real i rarely play these maps (just take the token) .

Dude send a friend request link!!

Mine is

It is much better than curent bo.Look at curent bo ,his body is horible

You get coins

Yeah, I kind of made it that way so the games wouldn't last too long
---
That‚Äôs why you shouldn‚Äôt play Mortis as a gem carrier in gem Grab, just go aggressive and keep those Gene away
---
I got Leon out of it when. Leon was still OP
---
Bo
---
Mike

Penny

Needs more watermark

Yes because supercell chooses what boxes has new brawlers

---
preposterous boast but alas
---
Rip Bo's Hat
---
Yes üê¶
---
Not really impressive...
---
Hmmmm... I wonder if there is a term for when you constantly win and lose something from a game?
---
isn‚Äôt it satisfying tho?
---
omg!!! yes yesy 100 times yes !!!!!!!
---
What are you on about. I‚Äôve taken photoshop classes and this is one of the easiest cases of image overlay ever. Plus, if you contact support there is no image of brawlstars settings in the background. The texts could very well be real but he did do some image manipulating to get it to where it is currently, and it‚Äôs very easy to fake.
---
They will never implement it, since the last time they did it, most beta players could max out their acc in as little as 9 months. 
---
Excuse me, how many fucking times are you mister/miss/attack helicopter gonna super?
---
well in the end, i end up liking it. So i'll use this for my next Knathan update.
---
Though since his Super changed from damage-reducing shield to damage-reducing ball, i don't think "Phalanx" is no longer a suitable name for it :/
---
lol as many times as i needed
---
man of culture!
---
Where is that picture from?üò∂üò∂
---
hahahah yes!!
---
I bought it üòÇ
---
total number of brawlers?
---
Matchmaking was supposed to be updated to include pools based on total trophies as well. Idk if it was implemented but that was supposed to be included in the last update I believe
---
Just give him like one or two more poison ticks
---
Now of course, I did play for a very long time yesterday (so much so that I ran out of EXP to earn and then played another hour or so), but I think it also shows just how fun showdown is with modifiers. It makes the game more action packed and I felt like I was almost always either finishing from 8-10 or 1-4. It was a ton of fun and honestly showdown isn't a ton of fun without modifiers due to the rampant teaming and people just hiding to avoid losing trophies.
---
The first person isn‚Äôt right when it comes to matchmaking; matchmaking is based primarily around total trophies rather than individual brawler trophies. But it‚Äôs not a range of 100 trophies; is generally a range of a few thousand trophies. (https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/anr35b/maintenance_inbound/?st=JSDEB1LV&amp;sh=7e742b4b)
---
That being said; the meta is fairly balanced right now; and while Bo is good, there aren‚Äôt really any characters that stick out as being completely OP (argument being darryl / Pam currently, but not until higher trophies)
---
At the end of the day; you become a better player by playing against people who are better than you, the challenge should be a welcome one!  The game isn‚Äôt meant to be one you can roll over; it‚Äôs supposed to be a challenge. 
---
My job goal is supercell. I try as hard as I love their games.
---
did you see the clip i posted?
---
I don't understand...  why is this worthless?  Isn't gold a pretty versatile thing to have?  You can use it to buy brawlers, power points, and level up brawlers.  Seems like a good value to me.
---
Wasn't expecting to read that here!
---
No he is perfect
---
Yeah lets make it so one super charges the next one 100%
---
Oh. That is awesome work. I am happy that I am competing with him for the same goal.

Oh no sry guys

haha needed the clarification. take my upvote good sir
---
I would love to see this map in brawl stars
---
Yeah I know it may sound weird but RNG is random, meaning just because your play the game for a while doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre guaranteed anything. 
---
This is accurate 
---
I hate to say it, but if the bird didn't come out, then they would know they had a problem...
---
U like bo?

It‚Äôs so good!

But they‚Äôre on sale

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt mind me just coming thru‚Äù

Thats not Very true...

Wait I'm at higher trophies than you (8499) and I'm like bad. (All brawlers above 400 trophies :P).

cool, but maybe the spawn points are too close uno team to another

Exactly. 
---
I believe so

Once he can 2 shot brawlers at 3360 hp or 3 shot brawlers at 3780 hp his playstyle is changed. When I say 2 shot or 3 shot I‚Äôm including 4 tics of poison.

Alright man go ahead and waste your gems then

Lets change ‚Äòhim‚Äô into ‚Äòthey‚Äô to be polically correct and I‚Äôm all in

The Shelly didn't seem to be afk, she was moving, idk why she spared me

I am such a good player...

Maybe it's the last guy Tara hit that got the goal, it's unclear who get the goal when they score themself...
---
Just your luck XD
---
It‚Äôs all pretty much bots
---
Those were paid actors

Penny is already one of the worst brawlers in the game, she would be useless with that huge nerf! But i completely agree to the other changes üëçüèª
---
Just curious what xp level are you? And not sure just leveled all my brawlers up evenly, and capitalized on noobs at launch 
---
?

Isn‚Äôt she like, 8-10?

Yeah i got 3500 trophies and i still need 2 epics...

Today i hit level 100 but i am still at 7/6k trophies i don't have good friend to play 3v3 and when i play it it's with randoms but in solo it's hard because tgere are so much teammers

I've never played caravan, but it looks cool

What's important, you need to get rid of 1 tile passages, they don't exist and can't exist on a map

Stolen?? I didn't still this post. If there is another post like this i am not aware of it. I found this meme in my computer which is stored awhile ago.

I think crow's star power is pretty good, the problem with it is that it doesn't feel like that, but it actually is

This is so sad ;(

Omg I wish I didn‚Äôt struggle with gold
---
Who says brawl stars doesn‚Äôt take place in modern times?
---
I think the actual reason is that in one of the older versions of Brawl Stars, half of the Brawlers had mirrored icons. I'm guessing that Tara was one of the Brawler, so her icon originally had her right eye showing.
---
I just got tomato
---
From a brawlers box
---
Still no string
---
Very useful in heist too, mfs getting in front of the safe only to make it suffer more damage
---
No because if he does it with the same timing, Shelly would respawn as soon as he lands and he could give some shoots himself
---
Spend your gems on tickets or key doublers. Everything else is worthless. Especially skins. Nobody else cares about your skin. 
---
Yeah some people are just terribly unlucky :( 
---
I've been playing consistently for several months and can get anything higher than rare even though I've put in like $40

I have been in that situation üòÇ

Only people that started the game in America when this load screen was

How???

I am at 3k and haven't gotten a brawler since Penny way back in my first weeks :(
---
The team on the right cant lose trophies. Theres no losing. Instead you get the opportunity to face off against experienced players at the cost of 3 minutes. 
---
great idea!!
---
Morti are our allies !

Mortis B A N G

Great concept! Wish it could get implemented üëç (with the string, of course)

But they can backstab us we can't trust anyone

Nice teaming

Lmao oof. At least you have the skin i guess

:p looks gud

True

Your welcome!ü§ó

But a primo would never be close to a bull because that is just dumb.
---
So everyone else is short too, El Primo at most 2 feet tall.
---
2 per hour 
---
oh hi snow_yy
---
who this?
---
Solo sd. Trust no one.
---
Hold up per day? Cuz that‚Äôs only about .456 posts per 45 seconds 
---
I can‚Äôt understand how many people can‚Äôt understand statistics and rng...
---
That‚Äôs a mega box one offer that comes by weekly 
---
If you spam too much targez will notice but not at the start
---
What would the stats be?
---
Like el primo with el primo health and 1800 damage in one shot that takes 2sec to reload. The super would either be a mini pekka spawn or lightning pekka.
---
The star power would either be lightning pekka where if you die the damage happens with a boost in speed when at bull star power range or it happens every kill or like frank or piper you'd get a boost in damage from either kills or first shots.
---
tomulin1e from discord lol
---
oh its weekly? I thought it was once a month
---
i didn't recognize ur name until after i sent the reply lol
---
I‚Äôve had that offer twice this month

Tara: I want a remodel, voice, and skins because I have so much skin potential

Dev team: **no**

Bruh I remember these teams like it was yesterday...
---
Bad repost
---
Over watch
---
I think that its a Great idea
---
I did the same thing and waited for gene's release, and got nothing. This just happened
---
Sometimes when you lag out, someone else plays for you. Either it‚Äôs an AI or someone from supercell... but i feel it could exist. Basically rigged to force you to buy something to level up your characters.  Once you level up, you‚Äôll gain a few trophies then they‚Äôll rig it again until you feel like you‚Äôve hit a wall.   I‚Äôm not confirming there is but I sense that the game has a way of knowing.
---
For example, they know your trophy count, they know you need to get to a certain trophy count but won‚Äôt let you reach it for a long long time and usually until you buy something. They also know which brawlers and everything you have in your account so if you win a few with one character, you‚Äôll for sure lose a bunch with the other ones so it always evens out.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt doubt that the AI or something behind the game is basically rigging the game so you play a bunch of level 10 players why the rest of your team is 5 6 and maybe an 8
---
*Cries in mortis*
---
I buyed because i need gold to upgrade shelly to lvl 8
---
I‚Äôve been playing since beta I had 13 brawlers for the longest time so I started spending money and my mistake I‚Äôve bought 4 brawlers 
---

---
AND LOVE
---
boughted
---
I literally got Leon to 500 in like a day or two because he just destroys. But with Crow, I‚Äôm stuck at the 380-420 range because people team up and just camp now. So late game when you only have 1 or 2 cubes and you don‚Äôt have your super... you‚Äôre screwed. So that‚Äôs why I said he needs a faster super bar because it‚Äôs his only means of survival in the end
---
Spend gems
---
I would really like some type of new end screen, something like this. I just think it can be polished more, but I like the idea!

Well, i thought he posted it first. Since you guys saying he's the "creator" then credit goes to him. So how do i give him the credit? placing his name on the title? ideas plz.
---
You have 7k trophies, but yet your max crow only has 300
---
Amazing!
---
Oh once you unlock them all it increases the chance on getting the new one so it's higher because you unlocked all other rarities. It says in the fine text.
---
I really like his super an star power
---
Consider this my signature. 
---
She has them trap eyes uwu
---
I feel bad for you. I am playing sice global release and i dont have only leon and crow
---
Awesome üëèüèª 
---
Bouyed-ght
---
Niice. I just got pam today so she will help for sure.
---
Either on title or in a separate Comment Below post.
---
Oh I thought you were a global Player making mistakes, and honestly, being all this time without new gameplay, I might have spent money too, I'm sorry for my misunderstand
---
That‚Äôs my risky click for the day. 
---
Lmao this is exactly how I feel, especially after I score all 2 goals and then some dude who didn't do crap gets star player
---
It's just wrong. Wrong, I say. 
---
Please delete the post
---
That would lower his skill cap but its kind of high anyway so i approve.
---
I had 3 colts vs 3 colts earlier
---
This is normal... It's not bad matchmaking at all
---
Eat this free karma my child

Hello everyone who has responded (or plans to), I need more people to play the game with, since very few of my friends play. So, add me if you‚Äôd like! :)

Also I need to know why I always match up with chinese people it‚Äôs frustrating because I wanna match with people from my country and not some tryhards
---
I got matched with two el primos 
---
Nice
---
About 2. He's gotta get nerfed in one way
---
Why u use sarcasm
---
Piper has the slowest I think
---
I don't think he needs one, as his name assassin Implies he swiftly takes out brawlers
---
Whilst his reload time suck he has a special ability that no other brawlers have, he can reload whilst in the attack Animation, meaning he has a slightly faster reload speed than. Colt, who is theoretically toes with mortis in reload speed. 
---
every crow skins NEED REMODELS... i like this phoenix crow, his eyebrows are different. it would be a great remodel! 
---
Cuphead type
---
Rarity doesn't equal better brawler. 
---
Hopefully not as bad as the original 
---
Please
---
How do you report if you can't see their names?
---
I just pushed my Darryl 50 trophies in heist. The maps with a lot of water it‚Äôs good for him. You just  hide in the bushes, wait for enemies to go past and roll to the safe through the water. 
---
im at 600
---
Map does not exist
---
Chest line, 'nough said...
---
Ah, Nita got a John Cena skin. Nice
---
God-damned old ass repost
---
Woah that's pretty lucky, I'm at 13k and I don't have crow and leon.
---
You forgot about his arm (the one holding the bow) it is ugly as well
---
I _bought_ it too
---
was about to say that
---
Selfies
---
Oh yeah, I‚Äôm completely forgot about her, even though she‚Äôs someone I have lol. But I never even knew that he reloads even while dashing. I guess it helps, and the damage buff REALLY helped him out, I still don‚Äôt think he can ‚Äúswiftly‚Äù take out brawlers.
---
Groot 
---
Not that op without his star power. It‚Äôs impossible to roll straight onto an enemy because they will shoot the barrel.
---
Was it worth the upvotes 
---
Not all ofc, he goes for lower health/damaged
---
I do agree the current way of autoaim hinders his ability against most brawlers, but he has a high dps when you think of how fast he attacks
---
How did you get a direct message from support? Every time I contact them a bot responds even when I say I‚Äôm not satisfied with their response
---
Ok when the native were around (what nita is) the ate the inside of the animal and use the skin as clothes (like bear skin) 
---
I like your style of art.
---
Really cool! I guess that took some time but the result is awesome!
---
This is true, and I HATE when I try to auto-aim and get caught on the corner of a wall just as I‚Äôm about to finish a weak Colt or something... that‚Äôs infuriating.
---
its a plane.
---
The guy's here: r/Jackstyle
---
Not mortis sutoaim
---
Brock colt and shotguner autoaim.
---
Just don't autoaim w mortis and you'll be fine
---
I don‚Äôt know about his super, but what I want is just one extra tick of poison damage, nothing more would please me.
---
Also, stop playing solo showdown, at that trophy range it becomes unreliable so you should start playing other gamemodes.
---
Teammates in gem grab are pretty capable at that point so I recommend going there.
---
Duo showdown also works.
---
I know that. This post is just a joke
---
I did boughted
---
The guy's here for proof: u/Jackstyle
---
Yes please lol
---
Fair enough. But even when I don‚Äôt I get caught on corners. I hate it lol. And yeah, their auto-aim is really stupid.
---
Matchmaking at its finest.
---
That fucking bastard
---
You should enter these into the map contest that‚Äôs going on right now.
