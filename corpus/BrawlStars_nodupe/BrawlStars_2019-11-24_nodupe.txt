This is not ur fault.. the players actually don't know how to play takedown

Don't worry. You will get it in boxes.

You killed brother leon shark. And you dont mess with leon shark mate pal amigo friend

it doesnt even do a lot of dmg tho, and it has such low range anyway
---
You go in their stream rn it‚Äôs KARIOS and they have a specific way for each of them to enter. Once you enter you hope you win and if you do, they ask for your player tag and you‚Äôll receive the skin in the following days.
---
I meant that they shouldn't do that because they came back from a break. They couldn't do all that before the update üòë

switch colt with crow

Buff leon . espicaially cause hes gettting a new skin

showdown probably maybe if you get rank 10 or 9

Just doing more damage and diving in is star player than yeah it ain't broken. Even that barley was great at dodging and doing damage. That bull feeded em so many time

It should be Nita Leon

this would actually be more accurate since noone picks mortis anyway

Hate to break it to you but every brawler can already see the enemy's foot prints. Look closely to the ground and there will be footprints

Honestly though I would rather have cactus man than tophat man
---
YES
---
Yes
---
Who is the skin for? Im very confuzled
---
Well the global players do get to start on a polished game.
---
The game was in beta for like 1.5 years. Most of that time, the game was really unpolished and crappy. It‚Äôs why all the OG brawlers get remodels.
---
Very cool! But the hands could be improved.

Damn. I feel old.

I play big game cuz its fun,  but not when it's all fucking Jessies

maybe i should do that lol

its sooooo cool!!

All those idiots maxing thier trophies with low level brawlers ruin the game

That's why I only play boss fight with brawlers at 700+ trophies, less idiots.

Its just a typo random
---
I am at 7,5k trophyes and i have only one epic :D
---
It's not him, it's a teammate. If it would been him the circle had to be green.
---
True, I'll wait

I doubt that by that time we‚Äôd still have devices, or even the internet.

Just typo random its

I think my art is not good

I‚Äôd say yours are pretty dang high. Anything over .1% is decent. But your‚Äôs, my friend is insane. Good luck on getting one!
---
I mean, ngl that burger looking *extra* yeah I can see where he's coming from. /s
---
Yes i agree
---
he should use the star on tara instead
---
This will lead to me getting a useless mortis teammate in heist or brawl ball lol
---
Oh
---
Yours is pretty standard for low rate Legendaries. This isn't high by any means. I was literally at this same % a couple weeks ago and now after opening at least a hundred boxes, I am only at 0.18##%

This map is too open. Mid-lane is sharpshooter land, left and right lane is a direct flank route. Basically, there is practically no cover in mid and it's just a sniping arena. This is giving me a bull pen vibe, which is fighting in a closed of area in mid, but this map doesn't have that much bush to cover you and there is not a single obstacle in mid to protect you unlike bull pen, where there was a few 1-block walls that you can play around.

Awesome for you. But this is a massive flaw with lone star. You do nothing all game and get lucky to have high bounty players in your area and all of a sudden, you win. It‚Äôs so dumb. Not faulting you for taking full advantage(and hitting some dope rico supers), but the bounty system just sucks.

I think it was mainly because Rosa was a rare and was so easy to obtain compared to Leon. Yes she was stronger but it doesn't beat having full health and have a Leon come out of nowhere and destroying you

Next level stuff right here
---
Maybe they will be in discount like the past Christmas
---
He doesn‚Äôt say ‚Äúmy new idea‚Äù. Just says it‚Äôs an idea. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with what he‚Äôs doing. Gedi gets credit. It‚Äôs dumb because this entire sub knows it‚Äôs not original and will roast him. But he‚Äôs not taking any credit for designing it.

**Skirmisher**
---
Skirmishers are light infantry or cavalry soldiers deployed as a vanguard, flank guard, or rearguard to screen a tactical position or a larger body of friendly troops from enemy advances. They are usually deployed in a skirmish line‚Äîan irregular open formation much more spread out in depth and breadth than a traditional line formation. Their purpose is to harass the enemy‚Äîengaging them in only light or sporadic combat in order to delay their movement, disrupt their attack, or weaken their morale. 
---
A battle with only light, relatively indecisive combat is often called a skirmish.

We need plushies of leon

&amp;#x200B;

Because he deserves hugs to recomfort him because he got nerfed
---
r/gachalifecringe
---
Even if you got crow, you might still want the nerf. For example, I think Nita should be nerfed, even though my Nita is rank 20. When you push non-crow brawlers, you will start cursing those crows again. So of all the legendaries, I don't want crow. I feel like I will never truly enjoy him, because he is such a toxic brawler, and so I don't want him. I also don't want Gene, because I don't need another mythic brawler, I need an Epic brawler. I don't have a single Epic, and I really want one.
---
That's just perfect
---
That‚Äôs what happened
---
He really isnt strong

Bruh, stop flexing

well its just autoaiming

We need lone star maps for short/medium range/thrower brawlers. Island invasion was a shitty map but at least it gave a place for short ranges brawlers.

No, yours is. Sandy also has invisibility but thats his SUPER which everyone has and has been MASSIVELY nerfed

He does???

They‚Äôre not limited indeed, and therefore will always be in the game.

I was happy because i was killed all game by Pipers and Shellys with super. I enjoyed that moment also because i got revenge on Primo and Nita who killed me earlier.

Yea but if you think about big game that's the problem melee and 8bit cannot be used anymore as they help nita charge her super by trying to kill bruce and everyone will just use nita or penny

One time i had an crazy win streak at high trophys with randoms, check my profile it's titled "Don't mess with Jess"
---
:p
---
Can you make some videos of sally Leon? Just to see a good gameplay, thank you
---
This could be a new bo starpower. It could be called track or something like that
---
I agree with you, I don‚Äôt know why you‚Äôre getting downvoted, this is low effort and not even that funny tbh
---
I have a classmate with the most big brain name ever: not bot1
---
Because I did sent to him email by brawlstar, He maybe ignored to me
---
The First fish looks really wrong

Welcome to Brawl Ball! Where we have toxic assholes, and to be honest, we can also feel like toxic assholes and will probably do the same at least once.

It‚Äôs not really considered teaming. In Showdown if you spin and refuse to attack then walk away, that‚Äôs not teaming. In Showdown if you spin and then both attack the boss, since the boss isn‚Äôt a player that‚Äôs also not teaming.
---
It‚Äôs called karma farming.

Plz don‚Äôt shake the screen

Who the fuck gave this kid silver lol
---
Yeah I agree, it's by a long shot the worst game mode for me too. Penny works really well IME, though I have her at level 9, so no Power play with her yet. Today I used Mortis and did OK, but in the last game it happened exactly what I said there; I went from 1st to 6th in the last 10 seconds, with 15 stars and dying only once early in the game.
---
I saw your other post here and its so nice to see u again (idk if u remember me im the one who called you "tall" lol)
---
Man Iove this, welllllll, I've got 250 coins..... interested in some silver?
---
Yes they will be back
---
Ah

Brawl stars

Well first off, supercell ruined the gamemode with making the boss go invunrable for a "short" period. They should make it so that no one can attack eachother and every one can focus of the boss like the whole point of the game more is
---
Are these skins limited?
---
Basically, at no trophy range they will focus the boss (I know this bcz I pushed my Colt to 1050 at takedown), but you can make a strategy to win easily (during my 650-1050 push, I got like 1 loss). You should go straight to the corner and farm power cubes during some time. 
---
You will sacrifice 20% of boss‚Äôs health and when he gets 10 seconds of the first shield, you should go to get him. Try to spin to the other brawlers and focus on the boss. This strategy got me a few trophies. 
---
Good game for you ;)
---
That was a spelling error.
---
Dude, same here. Have you found a way to fix it without restarting the phone everytime?
---
Yeah! Does that not happen to you guys?
---
We are aware mate but thank you
---
I haven't it
---
Well played
---
What it?
---
No one:
---
Some horny guy: ^Lord ^forgive ^me ^for ^what ^I‚Äôm ^about ^to ^do
---
yeah.
---
Supercell got to nerf new accounts for real
---
Hell yeah. Please 5v5 game mode for club events. That's all I need
---
Perfection
---
Well it is decently high, highest it‚Äôs ever been for me...
---
0.2 is decent tbh
---
Look at Rocket League. It has pretty much exactly the same training mechanic.
---
Well it doesn‚Äôt matter lmao don‚Äôt see why you care if I say it‚Äôs high.
---
That el primo is a fool
---
Dont worry, hell bring them back to you in about 3 seconds
---
I have sooo many questions right now...
---
you realized that NOW?
---
Sure post it!
---
Boooooo....
---
Thank you &lt;3
---
Watch out for spike!
---
A question: how do you put these faces of the brawlers?
---
Huh, yeah, you're right. Thanks though &lt;3
---
I'm sorry I don't understand whats happening... is pirmo a character already, or did you just mispell it and make an idea for whats under the mask?
---
They are not smart, they normally lose, and those are powercubes, not gems
---
Thanks!! Don't worry i won't leak the new brawlerüòè
---
Everybody knows that
---
Where is the signature? Out of the screen of course. You zoomed in so it wont show.
---
Sad too see my kind doing this
---
That trophy count vs. highest trophies tho
---
somebody lost
---
Like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/dvvpu1/snownew_epic_brawler_full_bodywith_voice_lines/) one?
---
Progress
---
I have the same issue. Unfortunately, your post was one of the top results on Google.
---
That's bad luck man
---
I am at 14K and only need Crow Spike and Sandy
---
Reloading music kinda make sense. He have to change the pitch
---
I've be n playing since launch and still don't got Leon
---
Thank you!! üòç‚ù§Ô∏è
---
It seems like with that skill set, he'd only be good in 3v3.
