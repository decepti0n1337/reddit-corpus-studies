Ayyyy cheers!!
---
Awsome memes incoming
---
should be 24h so these clowns dont get to it too often. if you accidentally do score by accident its still adequate to give you a penalty.
---

---
alternatively they could scan for people to whom that happen too often as a pattern and take away a brawler at a certain treshold.
---
Honestly if there were emotes in BS I could see people just trolling and emoting in the sand while invisible

I‚Äôm sorry but is that power 10 sandy I see?
---
Why would you have to pay 1k extra?
---
I always had an idea of Brock having a little sister that was a legendary! There she is!!!

Wouldn‚Äôt I have to pay 1k if I got it in a box instead? I‚Äôm new to star powers and no idea yet how they work.
---
Do I not have to pay for anything after the power 9 upgrade?
---
Its magic given by his father
---
Your right. This idea needs to be reworked in some way.
---
That Spike voice, tho.
---
U haven't played brawl stars for almost a year so I don't see any difference. Isn't this what the old icon used to be like?

This looks like that guy that made the rosa x shelly made this, good art, but it looks similar
---
Haha I still commented on a removed post
---
it's hard to explain because i don't speak english, but I just put sandy here because he seems to be from the same family of tara and gene
---
No the last upgrade you pay for is to get to lvl 9 after that you dont pay to level up unless u buy a star power from a shop. If u get it from a box its free and the shop is only 2k
---
Nope
---
wow! c u in hot!

Didnt work

It should be Sami

---
I notice these guys have "six" in their names. They are obviously working together.
---
Oh yeah, present! Uwu
---
Oh okay nice, thanks a lot for the info!
---
In your view, is 2k worth it if I have only 2.5k coins but my other brawlers of interest currently 400 or so power point away from level 9?
---
Bruh that Rosas name translates to ‚ÄúI like trains‚Äù
---
Okay thanks dude I just didn‚Äôt wait for the offers.
---
Lol I have loaded ricoüòçüòç
---
Level up your brawlers dont bother paying gold untill way later
---
Hes a guy
---
Yes, but it seems like he‚Äôs not seeing the core idea so wanted to explain it from a different perspective and in a simpler way
---
Gotcha, thanks üëçüèΩ
---
Gotta star playing mortis in that map, just for fun
---
We need it because there are more brawlers every time...

Damn thats smooth

Hey Dani! Can I get one to? If not, it‚Äôs ok.

Dude I‚Äôm rip I literally just got Tara today;(( I don‚Äôt have any legendaries which means I get to join the club of all brawler except legendaries. They need to fix the draw system.
---
lol i only downloaded game this march. I mean at least i  have all the brawlers. oh wait. sandy is coming out
---
Lul dumbass, Fortnite is on iOS too
---
A Leon, sandy, and 8bit comp would break siege
---
I got nothing in my 10k boxüòì but I are ready have mortis

Things under 6 are only rare because he sorts by top posts from the week, meaning it's only posts that people liked.

Yeah but it‚Äôs just stupid
---
Skills!
---
Big boxes are 3x better than regular boxes no matter what you think.
---
But we open much more regular boxes than big boxes, so we obviously have more chances to find a brawler in a regular box.
---
I liked his ‚Äúno head‚Äù emote better
---
True
---
Where did you get this footage? Also Hilarious!
---
Well I never go against

I watched him just now

I love the Piper and Primo icon reworks, I feel like they're not only true to their characters but also good looking, unlike Piper's first reworked icon.
---
But Bo. Look at him. LOOK AT HOW THEY MASSACRED MY BOY!!
---
Jokes aside, removing that line that goes up from his chin would probably fix his grandpa look.
---
I'm gonna miss the current Bo icon though. I think it looks great, and I never wanted a rework of it in the first place. Oh well, they can't make everyone happy, and I guess at least it's not a Piper-level atrocity.

Noice and you have Leon

Nice

Hello 0ngW

Do u have everyone else?

I was looking for 6 power points points for El Primo (I only needed 6 points to upgrade him to level 9) but I got Leon instead &gt;:( (I was at 12k)

Sorry, if I seem pushy, it‚Äôs ok if I don‚Äôt receive it.

No one will be able to get him
---
This isn't true. At the begining, it can be better to separate to get some of the outer boxes. And there are many occasions that force you and your partner to separate to stay alive.
---
This means a big box every 2 days. Really cool for f2p players such as myself (especially when the new brawler isn't f2p friendly at all)
---
I have Crow too, I have him at Rank 15 tho.
---
thats ok
---
Korean youtuber too
---
Noted.

Rip

I don‚Äôt like him ;-;
---
Ayy

lol.  With as many reasonable fair time-based ban suggestions that have been offered across many of their games, this is something Supercell will never do.  Trolls still make them money and they don't care if the community is toxic... long as that cheddar keeps rolling in.
---
Adi√≥s amigos!

 way more energetic
---
So cute
---
I wish i could chat with rando‚Äôs to tell them how much they sucked. But adding them is too much work.
---
Hate when people do that
---
No. They already have a voice for sandy
---
I see where you‚Äôre coming from but Sandy is kind of a legendary so it‚Äôs sort of like piper to crow
---
Accurate

What's the point of 8Bit reviving with no ammo? Makes the star power useless üòî

He looks like a wow gamer girl
---
Hope that happenes
---
Pam just needed a buff in general so im good with this. 
---
Medical use buff is probably a way to get Barley into the meta again since tanks and sharpshooters bully him into oblivion
---
Band aid nerf is questionable imo. They couldve at least compensated with a reload buff
---
No complaints with home run. Bibi is too goddamn strong with it
---
I also dont see why they nerfed automa tick reload. Feels unnecesary

some people don't like the bright red yellow combo. so they find rudo better.
---
I agree with this. Not only that, but if people team, they‚Äôre splitting kills or one is getting all of the kills. It‚Äôs not a survival mode. I think this could replace showdown as an actual free for all mode. I‚Äôm skeptical but cautiously optimistic that this will be fun.

You aren't taking into account t standard deviations. The outcome of the previous 100 chances has no bearing on your future outcomes.

This is known as the Monte Carlo fallacy. In the 1920s there was an incident at a roulette table where the ball landed on black 26 times in Monte Carlo. People lost millions at that table betting on red thinking statistics were on their side.
---
Same
---
I'm really looking forward to seeing if any other brawlers got new animations, but Rico's animations alone get me hella hyped for the update
---
I realize that, but i think that guy took it a lil far.  Also I personally think piper isnt that bad in brawlball.
---
When ya miss all of your rockets. Even the fourth one.
---
exactly
---
I'm not a very good artist please don't judge

Could be cool

Brrrr.. that face reminds me of Night Witch Mortis, the skin I hate most in the game

Hopefully Daryll got a voice too. Like I'm glad Leon is (supposedly) getting one but i think Daryll needs it more tbh. He kinda just has no personality atm

So two brawlers who can't talk in words can teach their child English?

Yeah I buy it

Mortis :

I'm wondering if that's Death the Kid from Soul Eater or some random dude. Pretty sure it's from Soul Eater
---
Disagree about penny. I think her cannon is pretty easy to dodge as long as you aren't standing still. And her main attack is just too slow to be useful.

Did I whine? Nah. Is your reply helpful? Nah.

Damn I remember the portrait only
---
Yes please
---
fuego is needed vs other tanks. like bull makes up for his lesser health and damage falloff with berseker/tough guy. but meteor shower means you can chase any ranged brawlers and also escape tanks not to mention the impact in brawl ball.  leon has 24% boost for 7 seconds and he can't attack otherwise he loses it,that's considered S tier . but meteor shower provides 34% for 5 seconds boost even if you are attacking .
---
I mean, you could wait to push him.
---
I agree with these first two...but I also agree with the op on penny too. I don‚Äôt know why but it seems like every penny on my team likes to auto aim spam 3 shots real quick and then get as close as possible to the enemy. Piper I‚Äôm ok with most of the time. Except brawl ball or siege. The. They can die in the fiery depths of hell.
---
The Sand council will decide your fate
---
GUESS WHAT WITHOUT THE STAR POWERS THE BRAWLER'S ARE USELESS THEY CAN'T BE USED COMPETITIVELY AT ALL!!
---
ok
---
Damn I really am that smol brain.
---
Sandy is a whole trap
---
We can make a religion out of thi
---
Asking the real questions
---
No, don‚Äôt ask for upvotes. The reason why he got that many upvotes was probably because he tried making an actual decent post. How about you try making one, instead of just blatantly karmawhoring.
---
He's about to smash Dani and Ryan.
---
And to think we thought the game was super fun when it first came out in beta... look how far the game has come.

can we stop supercell from removing everything thats midly serious in this game? like seriously those weird as shit dance moves dont fit a murdering robot at all.
---
Why shake the screen? Why?
---
Leon‚Äôs attack may be more powerful,also the invisibility zone is also visible to enemy brawlers,if they have poco or a wide range brawler,they can check the sandstorm.But leon is unpredictable,there is no pre-determined.

All true. But let's be honest Sandy's going to be the best in the game for a bit lmao

This is why you should check it on old ppl.

Even in friendly match &gt;-&gt;

i remember that too.. but this is a better implementation of that

Really?

I think everyone is forgetting that brock  has a straight up missile launcher and does only about 300 damage more than a shovel.
---
Oh Hello!
---
Yes, it would be for many players but everyday it becomes boring. You need a whole team to win in brawl ball if the team is bad you can't win but in Heist sometimes you carry you team.
---
Wow indeed

My Tara is 500 I forgot to crop her! In!

Sandy right now does not look broken to me. Maybe he will be, bit we'll only know seeing him.
---
I‚Äôm still mad
---
Probably
---
Ahh okay, just saying it looks a bit similar. Still a cool concept tho, not a bad map üëç
---
ah, such wholesome conversations
---
Okay, but if you are under 6000 you have a very low chance at a legendary.
---
Yes
---
Thanks :)
---
yep, they have their own slot
---
Loaded rico is different I think!
---
:)
---
Nah I prefer old animation and old rico still :)
---
If you don t have friends to play with it s not my problem, brawl ball si by far the most fun gamemode in the game
---
Not my proudest fap.
---
Ik hoef alleen nog maar Leon, dus ik ben bang dat als ik boxes open ik Leon krijg want ik wil sandy
---
I remember on day one when I downloaded this and thought it was fun but said ‚Äú I‚Äôll just play this when when If I get bored of royal someday‚Äù  4 hours later I delete royal and that was a great decision

Triple legendary team now has some diversity

No, he did both the goals. Which is annoying. And a team consists of 3 members. It sucks only if we dont have back up. Which he didnt gave.

You are missing some gems bro

Your trophies doesnt but they usually relate with the time spent on the game. The longer = more chances of legendaries

yeah you need to do that too considering how you say that shit because someone  has taken 6 trophies from your brawler in a mobile game

I mean the bull and el primo and also trash plus the primo own foaled also

You're welcome :)

Sand is basically small rocks.

Common: 3 Chips: Shelly (starter) Colt (predetermined box), Nita, Brock, Dynamike, Jessie, El Primo.

Epic: 70 Chips (changed to 60 later) Mortis, Bo

Legendary: 600 Chips (changed to 500 later) Spike, Crow

cries in 9k trophies 1 legendary

Still there‚Äôs no reason to quit after one mistake

Yeah

Best comment I've seen all day

Cause the primo and bull are so trash that he gave up on them
---
Flair does not check out
---
Mine is 0.4 xD
---
Aw :/
---
I main mortis and piper I guess. I recently just tried pushing my power 5 rosa to 500, so I'm a temporary rosa main for now I guess.

Well thats insanely lucky considering you're only at 4k

I think Rosa‚Äôs star power ‚Äúmama‚Äôs kiss‚Äù or whatever it is, the one that heals teammates for every time you hit an enemy, the healing went from 30 to 40

no sandy, spike, leon

Hes actually getting nerfed
---
r/brawlstarsp
---
 I know the usual dates of the updates after brawl talk, but u wanted to ask , just incase if the devastation slipped a word about the release date maybe here or on Twitter
---
Interesting...
---
Very nice idea but there's a problem. Supercell earns money for example by having brawlers that are very rare that the players can buy. If there's a gamemode where you can play every brawler, this concept of supercell won't work anymore.
---
If they really wanted to nerf coiled snake why didn't they buff mortis without his star power?
---
Imagine if they gave spike this voice in game and didn't change sakura spike's voice into a woman's voice
---
U kinda countered yourself by stating it takes time. With the newish trophy system, it's pretty easy to rise in trophies. That's the thing that real pros have talked about on YouTube: Their records getting broken due to people putting in a lot of time into the game. Doesn't make them pro, just makes them dedicated with reaching a goal
---
Sorry i wanted to post meme i edited and acsidently posted this shit
---
Brock is strong af, holding his rocket launcher in one hand
---
This is the only voice I‚Äôd want for spike
---
This is from the beta days, yes
---
Back then meteors didn't aim for teamers
---
R/lostredditors ?
---
Its also mortis time to shine! IM THE CREATURE OF THE NIGHT!
---
that defeats the point of the idea.

Huh,Good Randoms that let the Primo carry the gems neat
---
Noice
---
If you do it twice it ain't no accident
---
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCuzhhJld1RNuwnc2CUKoig
---
Definitely not 10k. That's pretty low maybe something around 17k
---
I dont like the buff, Bear With Me might outshine Hyper Bear for thr most part but it deals alot of damage if the enemy just leaves their base unattended
---
Bruh, bibi, piper, and mortis didnt need nerfs. 
---
And screeching solo was already weak with 1k dmg, now it deals less than pocos regular attack. 
---
Batting stance was always an option, even with 15% bibi felt slow.(slower than she was obviously) 
---
And pipers snally sniping felt underwhelming with 0.4 now its weak af with 0.3.
---
His textures were chaged once.
---
I'm gonna a miss this model, but am also excited for the new one!
---
Custom layout will fix this
---
Players who are not pro have lost purpose to keep playing BS at high trophies range so for fun they troll and ruin other players experience. 
---
I've reported to SC about this a month ago and the reply was " DON'T PLAY WITH RANDOMS " lol
---
I don‚Äôt really like his voice...
---
i agree
---
Yeah, but it's still extra damage, and about 3 times the range, speed, and goes through walls.
---
Frank's awful
---
Just wait it out?
---
There's no way they're selling a 30$ dollars brawler for 30 gems. They probably bundle him with his skin for 400-700 gems
---
congrats! join r/spikegang
---
Kinda hard? 14k with 24 brawlers is not that bad, you‚Äôre probably just not that good at the game
---
Shelly doesnt need no buffs , she needs nerfs. However band aid at 2k was enough but I'm not complaining.
---
He has too much of a big brain he needs to be put down
---
I so hope this is fake other than snappy sniping this is just..
---
Thousand lakes is gone :(
---
Nice one üòÇ
---
His calculations are too correct so he cannot hit a goal. We need to ban him
---
Just like pewdiepie, no... no I do not
---
THANK U VERY MUCH
---
I'm 3k and I don't have a legendary
---
Its against the rules i think. Atleast witch hunting is.
---
Too expensive aint buying
---
well yes, but MUSIC THAT KILLS YOU, literally like, about a third of a FRICKING SHOTGUN BLOW, i think thats enough to kill the avarage person or at least damage them for an extended period, i think the strongest thing in the game is pocos quitar, i mean, imagine if it was used by someone who not only has muscles (unlike poco) but has the muscles of someone who can CHARGE TROUGH WALLS UNHARMED??
---
Crosspost this to r/throwergang
---
Ok
---
Home run is way more used than batting stance. That mov speed boost always help her to approach long range brawler. Batting stance is almost useless because the shield will gone after attacking which mean it almost useless in battle
---
Rest in spaghetti, never forgetti
---
Put on a jacket
---
r/uselessnobody
---
Carl damage is amazing 
---
Only thing that affects him is he can't spam wall to get infinite damage
---
Are you at 2k trophies?
---
This is coming from the same person who thought Shelly needed a nerf to her range and super charge. I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre qualified to call anyone ass.
---
Batting stance was so strong, literally no one chose the 2nd star power over it. Movement is such a good ability.
---
As for Snappy Sniping it makes piper a lot better at close range which should be her weakness
---
Screeching solo was already more on the balanced side but damage on a healer is a really strong ability. I don‚Äôt disagree with the nerf.
---
Thank youuu
---
Excuse me wtf
---
I wish I could give it a platinum award.
---
Its a shame popcorn rico has a normal animation
---
Why woosh?
---
literally no one knows when the update is coming.
---
This is normal, what is your problem dude
---
In no dimension this looks cooler then the OG one. Get off
---
Everyone : *looks at shelly*
---
Me : WHY DID YOU KILL YHE ROBOT!?
---
my palms were sweating HAHAHA
---
You can use to knock them to a wall..... lol
---
Bibi is S tier in Brawl Ball, Siege, Gem grab....
---
Leon is just S tier in Showdown
---
Colt is not S tier in any gamemode...
---
So how can you say they are everywhere? ... am I realing me losting credibility here?
---
Honestly though Bull went well with Primo's animation.
---
A 30 trophy carl is normal
---
Very nice üëèüèª
---
A 30 trophy carl is normal?
---
Crow:
---
How is that karma tho
---
Why is the background look weird
---
thanks :)
---
Yes. He is in a team with that Shelly
---
So no one is gonna talk about darryl huh? Base stats are poor, ulti takes too long to charge, his first star power was nerfed to the ground and his second one... what even is the second one?  2nd star powers obviously needs a rework and asap, no one uses it, and this is mandatory. Then, you have two choices or you either buff his 1st star power (% of reduced damage) or you buff his base stats. One thing is for sure, Darryl needs change, and you people seem to forget about him... Where you at Darryl gang?..
---
No it still helps out
---
I mean that's the idea I kinda getting at but maybe something different a ridiculous way or option every brawler have to kill someome like a gun take 10 seconds to charge and immediately fire whne 10 second over also person cannot turn around
---
And the matchmaking picks the highest player from a team
---
I know that‚Äôs bs
---
yea, as Demise said (former #1 global) you need to team to win, but knowing how and when to betray is key
---
El Primo is good at Bounty, Heist, and Siege.
---
Piper is good at Bounty, Showdown, and Heist.
---
Please don't use a narrow mind when talking about Balance
---
Many brawler is already pretty balanced on the main stats, the last update which bring a lot of star powers makes a lot of unbalanced things. That's why they concentrate on it
---
It make sense
---
Why would a STAR POWER deals more damage than a passive main attack
---
I had once EXACTLY the same things in a big chest
---
It is duo lol
---
Rule 34 artists: hippity hoppity prepare to be our property

Shelly belly
---
What‚Äôs bs is if the shelly got to be in a lobby with level 23‚Äôs
---
No
---
I use her in snake prarie and rarely lose.  You follow a shelly or bull, keeping a bit of distance.  Then when they see the enemy, pick them off.  You can even use auto aim and do well with her like that.
---
Robo gang will remember this
---
What the fuck?
---
Also if the face on Mr bat is spinning, this means Bibi has her knockback ready. 
---
don't know if it could help
---
Your trophy?
---
On what?
---
Are you using an android emulator?
---
Ah yes
---
STblackST
---
Cries in having none at 16k
---
Darryl is very strong rn
---
Just overshadowed by bull
---
His accuracy buff was huge
---
Rolling reload....... sigh
---
She is in a team with the dynamike not my problem
---
Nice but we couldn‚Äôt do anything because our only ‚Äútank‚Äù was Bo...
---
I use it and it's actually good if you play with your teammates
---
Hence the 'endgame'
---
It only affects when u spam it against a wall
---
Sadly yes.... And i have star shelly skin...

How did you get 2 legendaries?
---
How much trophies u have?
---
extra life is basically 8bit's dead ringer
---
Why sc limit the powercube drop to 5 why?
---
Same lol...and I hate the risk of losing trophies in this improved star point system...I have a 600 tropgy mortis and even if I only lose 1 ill be at 599 and get less star points than when im on 600. Dont believe me? Go to the game and click on the rank icon. It says how the system works.
---
666 like noice
---
Is your comment even related to the post?
---
I fucking hate this game i'm done 12k trophies and no legendaries 
---
So basically if you get over 5000 trophies and you dont get any legendaries you won't get one good job supersell
---
I just got him today thinking that they might increase his price. And I was right!

Why is Brock looks like old Joseph Jostar?

I remember HATING this map lol

Reddit comment glitch got me no wonder I'm getting downvoted so bad

:/

played with a bunch of asian players recently, I had 2 games where one would always shoot the ball in our goal..

Man it's fan-made.

I love all these!!! Thanks for Crediting, do it alsp for u/Alextremox as he did thr original drawin'

SPINNING IN THE 90'S
---
All the deleted maps are in lone star. That‚Äôs pretty cool.
---
He‚Äôll definitely be getting an offer. I saw Frank confirm it on Twitter. I‚Äôm just not sure how much it will be, could be anywhere from 400 to 600 gems.
---
You need to make it when like you get killed by like a turret to make you go back a brawler
---
Gene and tara=sandy
---
Last three teamers were trash
---
I'M NOT READY
---
Sorry bud its not another ha ha funny elprimo 10 gems joke or dyna teaming :/
---
Maybe if you watched it then you would know?
---
fuck the brawl Stars cactus
---
I was near 600 trophies with Rico, but I mean keep the range with piper is the basic thing
---
Lone star is going to be a skill mode and I‚Äôm excited for it
---
I think sandy's voice line is snoring

I heard he is getting a voice!

My compliments!

U said colt and leon are unusable. Trash....is basically what u called them.
---
"She has been top tier since release" again, here we go with "tiers", it doesnt matter what tier a brawler is in, rosa, primo, shelly they all can easily beat a bibi. Doesnt mean they need nerfs.
---
No it wasnt
---
Me the same but with el rey
---
Idk what to feel about this tbh its kinda great but at the same time bad balance changes
---
thats impossible unless you in a friendly challenge
---
I think it would be cleaner if you only had a bar indicating the weather (like Leon) but that's a great idea!
---
Bon voyage cruton
---
Of course it‚Äôs unfunny if you say the same joke, honestly people who say the copypasta are clowns
---
Gonna upvote every  POST!
---
oh mad i literally have the same, only 10 power 10's tho
---
Ok i mistclick
---
Is his voice just like is super?
---
Uhmm.. because he wanted sendy and gets crow
---
really where is spikes voice?
---
r/woooosh
---
When old El Primo can't use his newer version of animation:
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
"I guide others to a treasure that i cannot posses"
---
Happy cake day. Cool concept but I don't think Supercell will add it.
---
I'm not sure if that's a bad thing
---
Stop
---
LOL
---
üò¢
---
Sorry misclick
---
I'm at 8.5 k with 2 mythics and no legendary brawlers I saved up 27 small boxes and 1big box so rip me
---
Back then the game was in beta...duh
---
cuz u nooob with it tho XD
---
Actually i have crow and he is very good. I said that just for joke
---
I feel bad for r/CarlGang
---
Thabks for looking out

No one:

Literally no one:

Pirates: Hahalalfalbagha

Bruh it's a Sans reference.
---
Best way to spend money is level 5 pack, second best is level 15 pack, if you see a x5 or x4 value buy it, to use the gems most efficiently buy 65 tix for 49 gems, trust me on this I studied it for 5 hours
---
spike could say the n word back then
---
There wasnt any  reason to woosh
---
Old primo was ugly af. Remodeled primo is the best remodel ever
---
Tara is just plain disturbing
---
Let's build a camp fire and you are going to sing a song for us.
---
Iit does suck, and I'd resigned myself to thinking I'd never get one before getting lucky with a free brawl box.
---
Do hope you get one soon though buddy, would be a shame to give up on a game you've played for so long because of this, and just think how satisfying it will be when you finally get one.
---
Good worküëçüëç
---
Uhmm, i'm not a bralwer. If you talking about flair, crow for me wors than mortis
---
thanks btw this account is rising very fast that i am close to get 1k karma in a day
---
om at 15000
---
Are Primo, Pam, and Crow T-posing because theyre getting remodels?
---
Yes? Like lmfao
---
F2P is the W2P
---
Bro retarded youtubers out here saying bibi is broken and 8bit sp is broken. Like they out here overating things.
---
Wtf stillnothing for rolling reload or steel hoops
---
It's originally form call of duty
---
Sucks I really want to buy El rudo but I can't because he's not in my shop
---
4 tiles*
---
i'm at 3k and i dont even have a single epic mythic or legendary
---
Sandy is 2 tiles
---
Well its called LONEstar but I still hope it does have duo.
---
Bibi is everywhere.. so i don't know what are you talking about...have you ever watched a competitive match? Almost every siege and brawl ball match has a Bibi......it is very very very hard to see a colt or a leon in this matches....
---
 
---
I choose the brawler you want to play but i do not play them in every gamemode right?
---
Because If you play brawler that are weak in that gamemode or map you gonna have a hard time..... like playing mortis on heist for example....
---
Tiers are of the current Meta.. so I don't know can you say tiers had nothing to do with meta..... it is like saying sausage has nothing to do with hotdog....
---
Balance changes are necessary until a brawler becomes balanced.... that is true however how can you say that a brawler that is in the uperhand  (S tier) since it's release is balanced..... to be perfect balance there shouldn't have any brawler at S tier and all brawler would be in the same tier..... if people can make tier is because the game is not perfect balanced...(it never will be because this is impossible.) But all brawler at S tier shoud be nerfed at least a bit. And all in f tier buffed at least a bit... so always the meta will change 
---
What Mortis have to do with all of it? That is nothing logic about you have said lol.
---
okay thanks :)
---
Very cool. Love the colors
---
Sexy af
---
yes this could be an option: You unlock the gamemode if you have 10 brawlers or more. The random rotation of brawlers you get if you kill an enemy only consists of brawlers you already have.
---
That is literally how darylls roll works
---
Welcome to meme review number #.I ran out of cringe intros so I'll just get to the point
---
he said ''r/brawlstarsp'' (thats a porn subreddit btw)
---
Dont take my job old man
---
Well, sorry then!
---
when to 100 hundred they open them when "they tec the video" or wait for the new brawler if they have all af the brawlerls so they dont het only coins!
---
I got all the brawlers at 1.k cos I spend money. And there is offer which is 49 gems for 49 mega boxes. You wouldn‚Äôt believe me but I can tell you my channel for proof but that would be self-promoting.
---
Sorry
---
You get an upvote for your in-game name :D
---
oh come on, everyone here mentions the porn subreddit everytime some mildly attractive art comes up. it doesn't even have to be sexual. its obvious that kids think that they will be cool if they mention porn.
---
There‚Äôs a rumor Leon got one. Not 100% sure tho.
---
eh
---
NukkuMatti on hyv√§ tyyppi.
---
But actually, that was a joke, cuz everyone knows crow is a good brawler
---
Killer Queen*
---
Excuse me *w h a t*
---
i hate it tho XD
---
Impressive
---
i mean, this game is mostly aimed at children with goofy character voicelines and overall a goofy theme. and the community is mostly children and teenagers.

#T-POSE DOMINANCE

Lol the problem is if you can clear out of max range she doesn't do enough damage to kill, and if you hide around a corner she can't chase.

So does Bo and Piper.

---
Wow, I physically laughed out loud. This is great.

I have everyone except for spike and bibi...
---
Stop it,get some help

And a bot carl doing 840 dmg
---
ƒ± dont care legendary, rare, super rare ƒ± only want any character
---
Lmao
---
It's already crow remodel after global-release
---
No shit
---
hmmm we don't know as we haven't seen him in sneak peeks for now or am i missed something
---
The second bot alive
---
Really? I feel like it didn‚Äôt change much
---
This is cursedbrawlstars look at Shelly and Jessie
---
Name doesn't check out
---
Probably tommorow
---
They also removed the Carl infinite damage thingy, they buffed his damage because they added a delay on his attacks
---
Very sus to post the info I collected and not even just write it down, but screenshot and crop my name out.
---
If you ported him straight over with his stats, yeah, but Bandit‚Äôs dash is way better. Coiled Snake without needing to charge.
---
No. Playing shelly
---
Sleepi boi
---
Funniest part is he even used 'Cara Simon' and 'Fellow Dollars' as names for the accounts he used in the dev built to showcase the update. You Tube isn't letting go of the name for Kairos.
---
Star power only
---
who is mortis?
---
Skip to end
---
I didnt know that, you learn something new each day
---
They didn't do that for colt for like 6 months
---
i perfectly made that 8bit face very detailed XD

Darryl be like: *beta super noises*

Here's the link

Thank u kind sir

You are welcome homie.

Nice job

Yeah but they made a change a while back to make it really difficult

It's the dev build

Is that you E Honda?
---
I really hope this get to hot
---
She is not used for just sneaking up on people she is used for ground control in modes like gem grab. Not exactly Leon who is a assassin type. Also if you think she looks bad idk maybe she will get a pretty good skin
---
CR officially dies
---
Yeah I get you, some matches I go way too defensive and it ends up getting me 4th or 5th so then I think I should go much more attacking but it also gets me 4th or 5th. I think I‚Äôll need to find the balance. Thank you for the Tip though I really appreciate it ! üëçüèª
---
Da capo buff is a good idea. Screeching solo is a bit harsh but will still be very useful.
---
Walking a very thin line buffing pam like that.
---
Incendiary buff is fine but still easy to avoid.
---
Carl
---
Bibi is way to reliant on her main star power and is just too strong. Good idea.
---
Piper snappy sniping nerf is fair.
---
8 bit doesn't need extreme damage and health so reload nerf is fine. Losing amo on respawn is kinda what I though should happen. I thought just being unable to attack for the duration of the sheild is fine but whatever. same thing.
---
Probably not, this is my first post ever... so...
---
Not in this update probably.
---
LOOK AT ALL OF THEM!!
---
Yeah, lol
---
I will stop you
---
You filthy teamer
---
ƒ∞snt anyone going to point out on HOW DA FUG Dƒ∞D HE DO THAT?
---
i think it‚Äôs just cuz his damage and speed are both higher
---
Wow I'm so happy I bought el rudo for 30 gems

Lord forgive me for what I‚Äôm going to do

Guys...

I think that the update will come after the sneak peeks are over...
---
Its actually a really fun looking map, i hope to see this in the game
---
Lmao Spike is a cucumber
---
Same. I hate that emoji Police thing crap
---
Thats literally what i meant when i said other than snappy sniping
---
&gt;he isn‚Äôt the only character with damage over time.
---
which ones though? the only thing that comes to my mind is el primo's star power, which is a star power.
---
&gt;. Leon is an inverted piper with a unique super.
---
well yes, but his whole theme is that he can go invisible.
---
They do have 4969 3v3 wins though, so maybe they are a second account of someone who wants to only play 3v3s on?
---
And maybe for Brawlidays too.
---
6k and I have everyone but the (now) 4 legendaries üò≠
---
This doesn‚Äôt look official
---
Would be awesome
---
Hahah look at the name dude üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Not really cuz he only gain HP after killing it doesnt help against his counters... it helps him stay alive longer and being more agressive.

It was just before 8-bit release.

https://youtu.be/NaZTdbDJKXY

Depends a lot.... If Apple approve the update and the youtubers are finishing with their sneak peak tomorrow in the morning there is a chance... :))

Yis its true
---
i mean,just look at this subreddit. nobody older than 14 acts like that. and yes, adults play those games, but children seem to be the main audience, with the whole goofy style that supercell has (le funny man scream, le funny vampire speak like a clown haha so funni).
---
Dude, are you ok? Like, do you sleep?
---
How can a bibi fap ?
---
This was supposed to make fun of el primo's range
---
Danmn boii she thicc boi
---
Ok im new to reddit and very confused: why the hell is it not allowed to use emojis here? On every other social media app, like twitter, snapchat, instagram or whatsapp, everyone uses emojis.
---
i saw mate thanks for knowing cuz rico voice here is epic
---
Legendary % goes down
---
Well as for your Leon argument, we weren‚Äôt discussing themes now were we? We were talking abilities. If we were talking themes you would‚Äôve lost this argument long ago.
---
As for the other damage over time, dmt is dmt, doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs from a star power. 
---
My point is, just because things are similar doesn‚Äôt mean they aren‚Äôt unique. Every character in this game, at its core, has something in common with someone else, with their own twist added on to make them their own character.
---
This is very much appreciated
---
i still believe that Sandy is a girl.. or tra-----
---
thanks
---
Such an amazing editor like you, deserves all of the legendaries!

bro

This is Brawlars, I think you meant to gon tother sub

r/lostredditors

non-symmetrical maps are harder to make

Your teammate probably wants you to retreat

your lost

Yeah it kinda sucks, but it doesn't need a buff, you just need to find ways to get close to enemies
---
God another recolor üôÅ

I‚Äôll admit sometimes I‚Äôm that Leon.

Oh yeah now I remember that

The remodels is making the brawlers more younger

Because that's what it is

Don't forget about the death of Band-aid now

don‚Äôt you even fucking dare

Yes but I think it‚Äôs too long like I‚Äôm not gonna be using the play again button ever if I watch him do his shit

U

I found this on a Twitter post, that's why I asked how to edit titles,
---
Buff Leon
---
yep, i mean i‚Äôm not complaining i have a 4 days break starting Thursday so it‚Äôs convenient for me :P god help the devs from all the questions about when is the drop tho
---
Well then that twitter person sucks
---
U have to realize for any game there's a different team for balance changes/gameplay and cosmetic things
---
I get 1 mega box
---
I killed you because i was thinking you will super me, sorry
---
You act like improving the trophy road would cut their profit in half. The trophy road sucks, and it‚Äôs not rewarding, that‚Äôs just the reality of it, so of course people would want to see it be improved. 
---
Supercell themselves stated that their main priority is making a quality game, not money. Quit acting like a drone and come to terms with the fact that there will always be areas were they need to improve in.
---
Atleast Poco helped to do what the Primo couldn't
---
tomorrow
---
Lol
---
Yeah I saw that  
---
But they relized Band-aid is the most used star power

There is literally no point. It's a fucking loading screen
---
Then what is the point of this post.
---
Can you join this room - X85YPJU4
---
lmao
---
Why buff barley. Also, replace band aid and extra life.
---
√©l era mi amigo tambi√©n ¬øpor qu√© los m√°s guapos dispersen m√°s pronto?
---
Boobs.
---
Nice strategy
---
Now Lone Star exists.
---
Oh shit
---
What about us f2p who don't even have a single star power, and who wonder when they will see real balance changes, not star power changes.
---
Probabile üòÇüòÇ
---
Tiks?
---
Your sister is dumb. In a cute way.
---
Sorry for calling her dumb.
---
Mortis is getting another nerf?
---
Sorry. Thats Rush Wars. (Pun)
---
Thanks!
---
Yeah a real big F
---
**they hated Jesus because He told the the truth**
---
I put it where it is born twice to represent when the match begins and where you are born when it dies &lt;3
---
**r/English**
---
It looks like an FBI agent
---
Lol i found extra life... But on archero
---
The poco let them score the second goal! Granted i accidentally passed it but at least I played my role the whole game
---
Sooo, how's brawlstars with a p at the end going
---
Cool art boyüëçüíØ
---
Imagine him pulling you and getting bitten by him.
---
F for respect my man
---
Right now I have 1.14
---
Bibi's 12% is much faster and Colt isn't very meta
---
Maybe. But we'll need to find some good artwork for it first
---
Brockley Is ok
---
i love how nita just runs into dynamike's super
---
Post this on r/brawlstarsnextlevel... we love fan art and concepts
---
Yeah tiks the insect
---
Hyper bear is shit in any gamemode thats not heist or siege
---
‚Ç¨
---
# FFF^FF^FF^FFF
---
FFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
---
cuz it's not a mortis
---
Why do they always nerf mortis
---
This is why supercell no longer gives update dates. If for some reason the update gets delayed the community will be too angry because it's filled with immatures. But if they do give the correct date and with no delay the community is still going to spam asking the time when update will be there. Said by Dani.
---
Guys im busting a nut right neo
---
This ain't overwatch.
---
Mortis doesn't need a hat. He never needed it.
---
ü§£
---
I was thinking more along the lines of 
---
**I WAS LAGGIN'**
---
Royale made Night Witch. Coc added night witch in the builder base later, then night witch mortis was added on bs.....
---
Wait i think thats wrong
---
If that‚Äôs not edited I‚Äôm including an F for your dead club chat.
---
SHARKS HAHAHAHA U GOT UPVOTE FROM ME
---
sigh
---
*unzips*
---
Its not purge cringe its #torture
---
My answer to the first part of the comment, that‚Äôs why I said it‚Äôs not serious, I don‚Äôt expect supercell to really just add star powers to brawl ball. Second answer to the second part of the comment, yes I kinda agree, having star powers for every mode would be cool but they shouldn‚Äôt really be star power, they should be perks that are more common than star powers
---
Yes considering its like the third thing people see when loading up brawls stars. first: app icon. 2nd: supercell logo screen.
---
You dont like somethink?
---
I think matchmaking considers what kind of  brawlers are going to fight in the game because this is sooo accurate
---
OW damn I didn‚Äôt even notice
---
okay thats not okay
---
Creator of meme template: u/Star-Tweet
---
its quite of a bad meme going on, like the "fun police" (fun not allowed) but with emojis. i dont like emojis but i find it dumb anyways
---
Eye of the storm is bad, the rest are fun.
---
üìà
---
It's basically doubled speed plus the half speed...
---
Yea could be an event mods. I liked the days where there were event mods for 3v3 but energy drink is op in heist.
---
Teaming is worse than ever
---
Yes but these things were mentioned today in Kairos' video
---
If you have 15k without any legendary, then you can complain!
---
So you have chosen..... death.
---
Yeah I agree
---
r/emojipolice
---
you're famous now
---
Crow's Star Powers are both trash...
---
I know haha, meant it ironically.. =D Hard to see sometimes on the internet I know
---
Life
---
I have similiar levels on Brawlers, but I have 850 on Poco, 750 on Shelly and Mortis  700 on few Brawlers and rest on 600 (also Tick on 400 somethin idk). I don't have Leon, Spike and when update drops I will be missing Sandy
---
Most of the old models looked awsome. I wish I could play as them again.
---
Shaders
---
Mortis got nerfed too tho
---
maybe you're right but i personally like em (shrug)
---
Almost 1%
---
I completely agree  but stop nerfing poco he cant say get into meta besides gg and bb (gem grab and brawl ball)
---
Lucky. Today was my day off üòì,tom back to reality
---
***8200 trophies***
---
Those are rookie numbers
---
Sucks, hope you had a good day, the update would have made it a ton better though lol
---
legend says you have a sniperella not a shotgun
---
Oh yea? Legend says im still at 50% waiting for the game too start
---
go into the subreddit. if you are on mobile there are 3 dots in the top right. hit that and then select Change User Flair.
---
look at the first 20 seconds and the last goal, they have no lag
---
Wow.... I can‚Äôt believe it!
---
&gt;Leon
---
leon can't talk this is an imposter shelly with super aaaAAAAAAAAAAA
---
Thursday
---
Usually when the update drops they will have a pack [Sandy + Sandy Skin] for 400+ gems. You can't buy the Sandy Skin if you don't have Sandy
---
Rosa was perfectly fine, she's always going to be a strong brawler because of her mechanics so why buff her? Pam wasnt bad either, just under used.
---
Is everithing apposto
---
Hopefully tom is a better day if the update hits
---
I heard he has some star power buffs, but it can't be confirmed
---
thanks guys
---
üôèüèºüôèüèº
---
They also changed his animation
---
Why then? Why not tomorrow?
---
Well, I think that might be too strong
---
Remember they still has takedown to do after that they will update i5
---
lol post it in his sub XD
---
I got ambush for 119 gems (my piper is at level 9)
---
7
---
Looks pretty dark to me.
---
Literally did this with el primo. He managed to take the cube...but then I got it right back for the sin of taking my cube.
---
To escape Mortis
---
Brother literally just pulled spike in a regular box when he just got leon like a month ago.
---
youre so stupid its crazy
---
sandro or sandrew makes more sense for him
---
and faster dash attacks, sometimes he dies before he does his third dash in a battle
---
Ok thanks for the info
---
I loved this map until they added meteors
---
How do I get a brawler name next to my name?
---
So you camped in a bush the whole game and still almost choked the game at the end?
---
Most people like piper and jessie more because they are cute
---
But seriously shelly is cute (no homo)
---
Happy cake day bro!
---
Yeah your right though im blaming coach cory for suggesting a nerf about the homerun star power
---
Would‚Äôve been a brilliant meme if you didn‚Äôt have the word crow and just had the picture
---
Ye that true
---
Can someone enlighten this normie on the meme? I saw one of this names on his videos and I'm confused
---
I have hyper bear so I'm glad it got buff so watch my bear go sicko mode
---
When i saw 8 bit....
---
#what the fuck did you bring upon this cursed land
---
Bibi's homerun doesnt even need a nerf
---
K
---
Thanks for wasting my time
---
I was thinking the same thing
---
I knew i would find this comment,take my updoot
---
Username checks out though
---
Wtf
---
Ahhhahaha my bad 4 minutes is not that bad tho i was mainly trying to flex with my measly 6 23
---
Chill
---
Just because a no-kill brawler killed a no-skill brawler doesn‚Äôt make the one that died bad
---
Jiang Shi is a kind of monster in Chinese fantasies, they‚Äôre similar to zombies
---
Ho ho, then come as close as you like
---
It was still extremely strong. Piper was still competitively good in places she should not be in. Source: Bralw Stars World Cup
---
I‚Äôm still at 5.5k lol, great for you
---
How is that related to this
---
Are you new around here?
---
If you want to see more, you can see the related video on my Youtube channel[shootinclay](https://youtu.be/98N26Sj5fhQ)
---
All I really wish is that they switch angry robo with life leech
---
Because that is the only way he could possibly deny the goal. This post is stupid....
---
I don't think so. You know, support team never was the best one in this kind of things like helping in ACTUAL gameplay
---
Can relate
---
Why mortis nerfed
---
It's u/Star-Twist
---
Lol, somehow I still found myself 
---
Thanks for using it :D
---
(Now I can't unsee star-tweet)
---
His name is a big Mouth deference lol
---
Brasil uhuuuu
---

They should at least make her auto-aim from a distance
---

---
