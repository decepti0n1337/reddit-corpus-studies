750 is all it takes in Ireland?

---
I don't know, Poco is more of a support Brawler, and this is meant for an aggro play style. It doesn't seem right for Poco.
---
I mean, you also stole the top art from u/GarfieldPlutonZ, but you do you
---
I thought he saw shelly with no clothes but catl said x ray glasses so poco looked at her skeleton
---
Gotcha
---
Oh skeleton so nice shape I mean 69
---
Well, any chat system is bound to get abused by trolls, so there's a reason it's not already implemented.
---
In the intro to the sans fight, megalovania dosent play. Thanks for the compliment.
---
Why?
---
I still don't get it
---
I dont, it was sarcastic lol, you dont know me that well but if u did u would know.
---
yea we aren't massively active lol
---
"1-up is useless outside of showdown"
---

---
lol
---
Lex did when it was at like 2%
---
Prepare for hate comments
---
Maybe mot u but The whole community hated me :( back then idk what i did
---
Gotta admit I was that Leon last time I played boss fight...but so are all my random teammates ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
It certainly is interesting, I've never seen something like this before, I was just a bit confused. Maybe it's because I thought that it would turn out that Povo actually had 42 powercubes or something idk. Great job either way
---
Very nice. But we already have lots of Mortis skins in the game. I would replace it for the night witch one.
---
I...I ah...I used mortis in boss fight yesterday...twice. Not even lying it was something me and my brother were trying to settle.

You placed second. The other guy won. Ouch. I know what that feels like.
---
What if the boss went from god mode to super god mode?
---
yes
---
That would offend the begansy
---
Yeah I got bored lol
---
no the boss health at takedown is 250k
---
How do you have poco at the same area as bull, I‚Äôm a poco main but Jesus he‚Äôs pretty unplayable alone
---
Why does he have eyes
---
Sneak 0
---
going to rank 25 as a power 8 Mortis is hard because everyone there knows how to counter Mortis, and he's weak without a SP.

I found this on Facebook If I can't post this just tell me in the comments I will remove it

How many trophies are u at?

Tks
---
There really isn‚Äôt much of a problem when your opponents are just as dumb as your teammates
---
Thank you so much for the tips mate. Can you suggest the best 3v3 mode for him. Being a pro Colt, I think I can play him well too it's just that I don't really play with him.
---
Disappointment
---
pocans
---
Make a super that charges up for 3 seconds by enemies attacking at the end it releases a 360 attack dmg depends on how much dmg u took
---
Brawl Stars, Hi.
---
Some days ago I write a comment asking if you can improve the brawler Daryl, because he is my favorite brawler and is really dificult up him.
---
And now I'm writing again because I open 11 Braw Boxes and 1 Big box and not won any point to up him power, please, I think he don't is so strong. Please, improve him
---
They changed it just because less than 100 people used that strategy.
---
That don‚Äôt mean u gotta be salt tho jus enjoy the clip
---
I ended up not playing any 3v3 modes while pushing, but I would say heist could be a good mode for him due to the fact that if you place his turret and let your teammates deal with your opponents, you could potentially deal massive damage to the safe.
---
My post is the same thing the Leon spun like 3 times and he lost to me
---
i don‚Äôt have crow btw, crow is my fursona
---
and not having him is really... the worst thing you can experience
---
El primo should be lower if were talking 700 plus trophies or even 600
---
This... does put a smile on my face...
---
Wow English is bestest
---

Seems legit. Gonna try him when heist comes in rotation

Yeah this has been frequent lately. I had a match where we lost in seconds, just by having someone grab the goal and scored on our side twice. The game right after I faced that guy that blew the game for us, and he did the EXACT same thing to other team (Wish I had record it). I honestly don't understand the point, people are trying to be "funny" I guess but this is getting old. Lmao people are unoriginal üòÇüòÇüòÇ

Cool but in nutshell always mean some brawler that in a special nickname

hmmmm... but still. The first post you have is here, and account just created after he got deleted.. post a picture of your account?

Leon can attack by throw the Meteorites and the Meteorites will get smaller and smaller
---
You know I had to do it to em
---
And?
---
Big box = 3 brawl box
---
Mega box = 10 Big Box
---
Shush
---
I do but this is shit, i referenced those subreddits because they do horrendous memes like this on a daily basis
---
You have that privilege
---
this list has 2 good things, everything else... no
---
Nuh i don't
---
I spended money to get every brawler below mythic (except mortis)
---
Then i got gene a month later after he came out 
---
Tara a month after gene 
---
Bibi 2 months after she came out 
---
Then spike 1 week later
---
"Quick Jotaro! The secret of Bibi's stand, The Gum is...."
---
Its not a legend sooo
---
50 no 100 that's a lot
---
I did an el primo one not too long ago :) I also did a leon around a year ago when he was released haha
---
Oooo
---
Yay, My team got featured in here too, thanks
---
(The team that you fought afterwards, Rosa, Poco and Spike)
---
"Day of the Dead" Piper
---
That‚Äôs really cool! Would you charge the super by hits or damage?
---
Why not dark theme?
---
207th bone
---
Porque esta un poco loco
---
... he's not a pro gamer anymore
---
Este destul de tare daca s-ar baga √Æn joc
---
The way that tara‚Äôs super works is it pulls the brawler to the centre of the super, has a small delay, then inflicts damage. During that very delay, the brawler is able to move (i.e. it isnt stunned) although the delay is usually small enough that they cant move much anyway. 
---
What happened here is you used the super so the primo was already in the centre, meaning this ‚Äúdelay‚Äù was long enough for him to move. In fact, he wasnt pulled anywhere at all.
---
not funny

Don‚Äôt listen to any of these guys. I only need your address.
---
It should be a exclusive skin for brawl stars sub Reddit when it reaches a certain number of followers.
---
I dunno man. I heard takedown and lone star were good pushing maps
---
Uhh no cause throughout the time we have spent on the game we have learned to appreciate everything and especially the devs.. so no we wouldn't complain about anything else, the legendaries are the only kinda unfair thing in the game
---
Its the same with 8bit
---
Power Cubes?
---
Leon: `guys im shaking`
---
And taht too
---
Halloween skins? I'm waiting for that.

lol nice drawing but Bibi is a woman

You knew i had to leon to em

You should really warn people about your post giving possible aneurysms.
---
And where? I can‚Äôt support through those, you see I have 2 accounts, on one donatil, on the second there. and I can‚Äôt contact the support agent, because I have support from the account without donation
---
I thought it would be a good idea.
---
Who's here from Kairos? Nice meme btw
---
What about sending an email? Maybe
---
there goes another 10 seconds of my life
---
What?
---
If you want to contact brawl stars support team the you can do that in game.
---
wait what 50 seconds?!
---
Insert generic top hat mortis joke here
---
What if they add a poco skin to every brawler
---
The guy has pink hair. He‚Äôs not really a tough guy per say but he‚Äôs like those guys who are models that care about their looks alot
---
nah it‚Äôs ‚Äúasi me gusta‚Äù
---
I said in post that im out of my support ticket, did you know that in game contact is limited? Also for what you reading this if its not for you
---
IT'S NEVER THAT OVERUSED ON REDDIT!!!!!
---
Try to edit hp bar a little bit better and don't add shadows on text
---
Underrated comment
---
That‚Äôs pretty cool!
---
Hasonl√≥ lenne, mint Bibi?
---
Let's Netflix and chill.
---
Super rare have 4 Brawlers
---
90% mythic
---
Bad, yes?
---
correct
---
doing that would make lvl 10 leon and gene OP and give a huge advantage for them
---
Mortis is actually good if your team are low levels. He can dash around waiting for you to respawn. I tried it once and beat insane 3, but yeah most of the time they're trolling.
---
Same thing happens to me
---
Tak
---
Where the mortis will go tho
---
edward...
---
Shut the hell up with rosa...rosa is trash now with only 3 seconds of super
---
Thank
---
But push to 550 and collect the star points, get the season boxes or skins
---
I want to give you a medal but I have no money so here‚Äôs my personal one üèÖ
---
This would make poco useful in heist
---
Or just like defeat 100 brawlers in showdown
---
Good idea
---
I got in this situation but im the player Who kills the thee enemies (sry for my english)
---
The second one kinda reminds me of PvZ 2
---
His pointing at you
---
Yea, im still waiting to this day they both heal and damage brawlers
---
So we we should tie the game
---
Yea they are :3
---
It sure as hell makes sense.
---
You can add another one to this tho. ‚ÄúLine up perfectly to heal both teammates, when each opponent has less than 800 hp, killing everyone with the screech.‚Äù
---
i got the idea cuz [I did that once](https://reddit.com/r/PocoGang/comments/ctaoa2/recently_joined_pocogang_my_favourite_brawler/) lol (before the nerf)

Either, I got Shelly to level 9 earlier today so I was going to take whatever I could get

Thank you :) I will admit that I tried to get the most undertale looking don't, but that would mean I had to download it and the process worried me a bit.

You litterally posted the same meme 4 times

Then who will mortis play with? Think at that. If you do that, then it will kill the whole *random* thing. I know why you said that, but I feel like it's wrong

Era per evitare lo spownkill da parte degli avversari in modo che non avessero ripari per recuperare la vita e anche un modo per avvantaggiare i player forti dalle lunghe distanze senza che muoiano sempre dai tank come bull, El primo per distanza ravvicinata. Come molte mappe con tanti cespugli e luoghi chiusi, questa √® il contrario, molto aperta ma con qualche riparo. Ma se vedo che a molti non piace la cambio oppure la modifico

I actually downloaded the game in 2018, got star shelly, stopped playing for almost a year, started playing again last month and got 1 legendary and 2 mythics before I even reached 3k trophies. This might be the first game where the the luck is on my side
---
F...
---
Thanks. That's a compliment to me since I am still kind of new to the concept.
---
I was 10k with 19 brawlers last year October but I waited after 1 year and paid some money now I got all brawlers

I guess im not alone

---
You can't argue about tbat
---
Lex
---
I mean, what in the cinnamon hecc is Shelly good for on Bounty? Chip damage at 420 damage, slow projectile, super can't do much, slow speed and bad damage output, and gets three tapped a lot. 
---
Crow can do huge damage and pressure a brawler who becomes unable to heal while keeping at a safe distance, and braindead fast speed, and Poco with super can take on a whole team by himself, loads of health, no need to aim, fast ammo, and Screeching Solo is a thing too.
---
Coach Cory used to be the best BS YouTuber by leaps and bounds, but now he just says what is predetermined in his narrow idea of the meta, and generally just speaks straight up bullshit.

I know, but he was replying directly to the comment, and you replied to the replier. Therefore he was the original replier as he replied before you.
---
I didn't mean to be so critical, but maybe different shades of the colors you used would look better. I just can't really picture Mortis as a King/Emperor, if you know what I mean. Maybe if you changed the expression and hair and stuff like that it would make more sense. I appreciate your effort though.

Removed - DO NOT SUBMIT POSTS WITH TITLES IN ALL CAPS. CAPS LOCK IS CRUISE CONTROL FOR COOL

no, screw everyhing except that

crap, she can't. interesting..
---
I had this dumb situation
---
Leon voice was supposed to come at last update according to the Korean ytber
---
Mobideak's super isn't go under the ground, it jumps like El Primo, but 3 times
---
If you tap on a big or mega box in the shop and then tap the i in the top left corner you will see your chances for a brawler of each rarity, as well as your chance for gold and powerpoints, and your chance to get a star power. Each box has those chances for what you get in the box
---
Yeah, and my next reply explained how you were replying to the original replier, and you literally repeated what I said a few replies later.
---
imagine you get sandy and he gets nerfed to the ground **insert evil face**
---
Bibi's username is dio brando
---
Yes
---
Bro thanks Carl my throat was gettin a little dry
---
Randoms im nutshell
---
The boss has a big hitbox. As of what you've done you have pushed the boss into the wall. Its middle is at the wall and one half stretches out over the wall. This also happens with the bubble. This makes a hitbox collision in the walls. Weird isn't it?
---
So im braindead because i didnt see ur reply?
---
Mistakes happens and we can fix dam
---
This without the last sentence would've been good
---
Very sad I pre registered for the game and got Star Shelly but forgot to get a supercell ID So when I started over in June I was a little sad
---
Can we drop a nuke BRUH here?
---
got Pam and Rico
---
Why
---
You absolute neanderthal, I called you braindead WAY BEFORE I explained that you were replying to the original replier. I called you braindead because you said Power 10 Crow Rank 23 "was for noobs". How tf does that make any sense.
---
I want that to be added as a skin
---
I had this situation... is so weird seeing better bibi‚Äôs trying to kill me
---
Amazing Grammar
---
Nah, it's just a face cloak.
---
Got Pam and Bibi, let‚Äôs try it
---
Nah it looks good! Great job!
---
True, I guess they didn't start doing events until global launch
---
Ok that's some good fun
---
Uh yeah flexing power 10 crow rank 23 is for noobs, having a star power and only rank 23 its pretty bad
---
Hahahaha, that would be an awesome meme
---
Tell that to Barley. My boy got dropped 17 spots because "Tick exists"
---
He literally only said Duuud
---
What‚Äôs a grammar?
---
New poco skin LEAKED
---
*KONO POWA*
---
move over thicco, we now have ticc
---
Woah
---
Yep
---
These are also included in the voice acting,but didn't include it in the video so don't lose hope,I'm also thinking of adding a lot of other phrases people suggest,and thank you so much for the support! It means a lot to know that people are liking my work
---
Grammer
---
(idk)
---
Rosa: C'mon Rico, cheer up :D
---
Since when was flexing only for noobs? Also, not everyone got time on their hands to push half their brawlers past 800 trophies. Just put down your device and go outside, it's for the better.
---
No problem!
---
Band aid kinda sux its better to slow the boss down
---
You aren't wrong.That Mortis was soo shit.He just standed still thinking:*Ahh i'm gonna give this guy a chance*
---
Meanwhile my mortis is stuck at 550 when he's suppose to be at 666
---
Why flex if u dont have time to play then?
---
It's cool ! It's a pun - *witchout* instead of without, because it's on halloween !
---
Never before have I seen a person make an obvious pun by mistake haha.
---
your art is so awesome can you please post somekind of speedart how you draw these
---
My mortis got over 650 then i stopped playing for 2 weeks rip my trophies
---
Maybe 1 or 2
---
My experience with the revised boss fight is that there‚Äôs greater variability on teams that can work, and also an increased reliance on the gem carrier to survive to carry through the final stretch. 
---
Most of my winning teams so far have been some combination of Colt, 8-bit, Pam, Bull, El Primo, and Shelly.  Even managed to get through insane 5 with someone using Jessie üòÆ

---
Bad matchmaking i think
---
I don't get this
---
Him flexing was unneeded, but time doesn't have anything to do with flexing. You can flex your Rank 15 Tick and it would still be flexing for some players, headass.
---
I want Penny's  star power
---
contact the support from other acount
---
I mean you can pray Game Center or Google Play Store was logging in your progress. You'll know it worked when you redownload the game and you see your progression still there. Otherwise, I'm pretty sure the answer is no.
---
Penny's star power
---
Looks lovely to me

someone stole your acount

I know

they're kinda a karmawhore. started telling somebody "you can't ever use emojis omg!1" without even knowing why, and then said "idk im not using them i'll lose karma".

Only the legendary box, and only as a 15k reward at the end of trophy road.
---
Do your remember when Morris had a hat and you didn‚Äôt have to buy it? Good times
---
I don't think you read my comment, because I literally said that it would still be considered flexing by newer players. Do you need help with reading comprehension or...?
---
He throws fidget spinners tho.
---
Thanks, man. I‚Äôm at 12k and this meant a lot to me.

My map for brawl stars is in heist game mode.
---
Ha-ha realy! I did not notice!
---
Ok Crow and Mortis are assassins too but they do have a voice.
---
I did read that, but i dont think people actually flex with that, they know they‚Äôll be called noobs right?
---
This whole comment section is just people complaining about not havikg legendaries
---
Remember when you said I'm a bad random well now I use piper in boss fight I just unlocked her the same as franküëåüèøüëåüèø

You know he has to do it to em.
---
Apariently you can not beat the *ultra* flex
---
Nah, kids on this sub will do anything to feel better.
---
Come on I already said I want to say joke can you pls settle the nonsense
---
Did you seriously submit a ticket, wasting someone time to ask that dumb question. How big of an asshole do you have to be? Literally everyone knew they were doing a Halloween update. Brawl talk will probably happen this week or next.
---
That's basically me except i dont have 3k trophies or any mythics :(

That looks creepy

This was before they had ranks after 20. The bar would fill at 500 and if you were above 460, it would show progress.
---
Yeah, that's Brawl Stars with -95% resuloution.
---
You sure?
---
No it isn't lmao. Tara isn't a 'ghost' because you cant see her face lmao. Tara is named after tarot, so we can assume she's just a very-good-at-card-throwing fortune-telling woman

Who is bottom right?

That‚Äôs awesome man

To just reveal them

I started playing right after star shelly came out i was at about 5k when i first unlocked spike since then eceryone but crow and leon. I made another account at 1200 trophies i got crow gene piper and frank within 7 ,reg boxes
---
Dyna cuz he can ez kill someone with his super
---
Ticky
---
first one should be healing himself
---
But why the enemy are all over 500 and I think there is a lot of people who carry their friends, this happened to me a million times
---
I say Dina because he does a LOT of dmg and if u have his star power, he becomes even better. Plus his attacks are faster

The effects in game are pretty, so why would you focus on how it looks on the menu?

the third primo is called stand but he jumps lol
---
Who is Joe? I am at a loss. Btw I'd say a tick head from a 12 power cube tick.

I was at 700 shelly trophies and got matched up with somone with 400 total on my team. Meanwhile I was 15000 trophies above him and nearly double with just one brawler

He's Poco now. :D
---
Cute
---
I play Tara, Poco and Crow in Bounty/Siege. It is effective in it's own way. It's okay, everyone has their own personal tier list, these guys pay their life savings out and can't beat most players who are miffed about their tier lists. Apparently to them 'more DPS = more aggro'. That's flawed in every way possible.
---
Yes this is an old video

Well... this cant be good. Rip bibi

That‚Äôs really nice, aw

I think I heard this before too.

Yea and when you get the cubes he‚Äôs so good

Ah yes, a fellow dollar.
---
It's my first one so it may be bad
---
Very high quality art, how long did it take?
---
Kk goodluck
---
Tara
---
Sandy is actually very balanced, even underwhelming. His only saving grace is his damage star power.
---
Bo is really strong rightnow
---
So soy choccy milk IS possible?
---
When two pros are playing you can see that some brawler are objectively better than others. Tara is just really bad rightnow
---
The game literally commanded you to level up your Piper with that one.
---
ewww android ur a loser can‚Äôt afford apple ü¶ü

Ofc while using 8bit lol

Ah, I see.

Spike had an open goal in overtime and he kicked it away haha they were cool

You are making your life so much harder with being so "unsure" about yourself.
---
I literally can‚Äôt play gem grab or bb with a sandy on the other team but supercell always makes a brawler so op that people need to start spending money to get them
---
Ohhhhh gotcha, thanks for the heads up! I didn't recognize it üòÖ
---
Honeycombs WITH stingers that leave honey trails?
---
but spike is already a cartoon

Has it? I browse this sub frequently and I‚Äôve never seen a bee Leon skin.

Forgive me lord for what i am about to do
---
No problem
---
My favorite character is Piper's umbrella! I wish you could play as it!
---
Gedi kor predicts skins almost on-point. But jist not on the right brawlers

Cuuuute

Im at 9k and only missing 2 legendaries
---
If matchmaking was based on brawler level, low trophy players would get matched with leaderboard players, is that what you want?
---
This kid sucks if he uses emojis and wants el primo
---
Did u pay and how long u been playing
---
Can you not do this? Do you know, other people have to suffer with a Low power inexperienced Shelly who probably misses their shots? Literally yesterday, using 500 mortis, I got teamed with a Shelly at 24 trophies and Bo 400! We lost, and I got most hits. Don‚Äôt do this.
---
While you downvote me, you know it‚Äôs the truth. You should let new players play by themselves first, and give them tips so they can get experienced. If you wanna play with them play friendly matches so they can practice.
---
Edit: starters won‚Äôt care about this cause they don‚Äôt lose 6 trophies per match loss. All my brawlers are at least rank 20 confirming a 3v3 -6 at the least! While you new players lose and still get trophies.
---
Interesting...
---
Kill Me.
---
Hmm wouldn‚Äôt it be great if when Darryl is in the starting area, instead of popping out and pointing his guns he hides away and makes himself look like a legit Jack-O-Lantern, glowing light and all? 
---
This is just food for thought tho, if the skin idea actually was implemented in gameü§î
---
Pam and 8-bit's turrets are implied with thew carpets.
---
Woah how did you make that
---
I small price to pay for salvation
---
makes sense XD
---
Make the credits bigger
---
ah
---
I posted one like 20 seconds earlier before yours, no offence
---
It's not true Gene main attack only hits 1 person
---
What‚Äôd they say
---
How bout Pam's healing station?
---
Watermark so no one would steal.
---
left is long range/bulls and the right side is... the right side ...
---
What‚Äôs kind of bot doesn‚Äôt beat hard
---
I think is enough big, the people when they see the icons, can see the credits
---
judging by the votes and how they remodeled tara and piper by those votes yes
---
Waht have u done!
---
Petition
---
I was going to do this but your idea of bibi stood out
---
Thanks for inspiration tho, I‚Äôll try and see if I can credit you somewhere if I finish rhis
---
Excuse me but I think you're **CoPyInG mE**
---
NP! üòÅ
---
Thank you :)
---
It can split and hit multiple at once
---
This spoke to me spiritually
---
But it‚Äôs hard to read
---
sandy: cries in the corne- oh nevermind he is too lazy to cry
---
Is enough if u zoom
---
Sorry for my bad English
---
I know but that's not the MAIN attack. It's the secondary attack
---
leon looks amazing
---
Tell me why
---
But I do have a question, I‚Äôm using KineMaster too, did you like individually put the words for the dialogue or is there an effect
---
YES
---
There's an effect for that
---
???
---
It‚Äôs part of the main attack. 
---
The ‚Äòsecondary attack‚Äô is the super.
---
Bo. You can see that you exploded first when you slow it down a bit
---
Clot looks so good. :)
---
Ah I see. Could have made a bigger implication with a pixel skull and the plus sign on the carpets
---
Good pixel art ;)
---
This post is so old bro..
---
They did already remodel to Tara El primo and Piper no matter what the survey said so it‚Äôs not relevant..
---
My wish that crow get remodel to all skins that are maid but it‚Äôs a lot of rework ..
---
No
---
It's not the main attack does 1400 damage at max and the secondary attack is comes when the main attack doesn't hit
---
Another tip. If you are fighting another Brawler and you are definitely going to die, accept it. Dont fight back. Unless you really need to build Super, dont. If you take them to low health, they could get killed right after you die, which means 2 people get points instead of just your attacker. 
---
It seems backwards, but it do be like that.
---
r/swapaccount
---
What‚Äôs the purple and blue thing in the back?
---
Big flex on people, especially me
---
If they do the better make white crow look better and Phoenix crow look god like, based on his price.
---
good bot
---
Nah it's still the main if you didn't know
---
