---
Don't talk about my son you little son of a bitch.  If you don't like the post kindly fuck off.  I've made it abundantly clear i don't fucking like you.  Go make your own shit
---
Now i know why they give skin.
---
Works on mobile
---
Yes?

Dumb Ricos, episode 1
---
I don’t see why you guys are giving hate cause of a Leon at level 100 when it’s a idea he doesn’t mean you get Leon at 100. He means skin rewards or you could buy skins at level 50,100, and 150 for example
---
I just reached lvl 100 so I wouldn't complain 😁

Hey dude this is a repost taken off my concept idea and pls report this for stealing my concept idea!

Btw if you havent realized it yet.. I made the original concept art!

10 levels for a small box? what a scaaaaaam.
---

---
I never even unlocked Ricochet. I only got to unlock Rico because my luck was bad.
---
Rip dyan, my favourite brawler, his old model was awesome
---
And you see me struggling at power 7 at 10k throphies. This is a great accomplishment. Wonderful job!
---
I mean yeah it's a strategy people will always just find something to complain about
---
Sad
---
After 7 moths I'm almost at 10K
---
Than you. An actually intelligemt person on this sub.
---
Just play duo showdown insted of teaming
---
upvoted
---
I've got 1k wins in both they're not the same gamemode dude
---
Kinda like Rosa
---
But thats not a joke and it wasnt even fast
---
True dat the meta where pam,spike and leon dominated needed a nerf especially pam
---
Its a brawler rarity idea. You can fond it in my profile.
---
I might make brawler ideas soon
---
1.1k congrats
---
About this I'm agree with you, now 800/900 trophies are more accessible. But the other slot are a bit unfair with a -4 ratio for 900-999, -6 for 1000-1099. I don't remember now what was the range with this ratio but it's still a very good achievement to reach. Not  seriously crazy like before, the rebalancement surely make easier to drive a brawler to 1000, this is an objective fact, but it must not be undervalutated
---
What’s cursed
---
Looks like that character from one punch man
---
r/perfectlycutscreams
---
just play a different game mode unless if you aren't skilled at tick...
---
This idea is cool but it will never be added. Life leech was removed because it was too complicated for new players. Life leech isnt even that complex. The brawl stars team is really strict in keeping this game suitable for children.
---
Once there was this little black boy. He loved to joke around and Play pranks on people. One day he was helping his mother in the kitchen and some flour spilled all over him, with a grin on his face he looks at his mother and says “ MOMMA, I’z WHITE” So she turned around and smacked him and said “Go show your father”, so he goes to his father and says “DADDY, I’z WHITE” So he turns around and smack him and says “Go show you Grandmother what you’ve done “ So he goes to his grandmother and says “GRANDMA, I’z WHITE” So she turned around and smacked him and said “Go show your grandpa what you’ve done” so he goes to Grandfather and says “GRANDPA, I’z WHITE” so he looks at him and smacks him and says “Go show your mother what you’ve done” so he finally gets back to his Mother and she ask him “Now what did you learn” he instantly answers “I’z BEEN BLACK ONNNE MINUTE AND I ALREADY HATE BLACK PEOPLE” 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 Bu-Duh Tsk 😏😏😏😏😏😏

Is it harder than getting to 500 in previous system?

That's exactly what you *want* me to think... You want me dead as a doorknob as soon as you see me creep out of that bush... Hnnghhh...
---
Uhhh no the balance change wasn't at the same time? You're just plain wrong. And congrats I guess but I wasnt really talking to you
---
It happens to most people. Make sure to turn off devices (like TV, computers, etc) if you aren't using them or the wifi is gonna slow down.
---
Would love this
---
MOLTO BENE
---
You’re trash
---
Congrats
---
I guess, you plateaued.
---
Then it would be the third star power. Theres already a new one called "curveball".
---
Lol

Unpopular opinion: there are very few good Mortis players. Mostly try-hards.

Ok. Could you say what do you think about this idea?
---
nice

got that a long time ago
---
The hero we don’t deserve
---
Thank you! I wanted to do with lvl 1 Barley, but I upgraded him by accident ^^'
---
Which volume is your favorite? They’re pretty long, have listened to all of them completely?
---
I’m going through them one at a time and volume 13 is def my favorite
---
Kind of yes, the skins are too expensive.. Too much.. The better of all they I think is Robo Spike..
---
Also, they upload an animation showing the new Robo Spike skin, and the animation end with a ‘’to be continued’’ so we can think the team will release animations and when all will release, put the skins on sale.. That’s what I think
---
I feel like the homing would be a bit broken, but could be fixed to be a fair star power. Supercell did say that they now want star powers to have more significance when you unlock them.
---
This just in close range characters are deadly at close range, more at 11.
---
People can’t make good thumbnails
---
What about the launch pad on the right
---
That skin concept is amazing
---
With Band aid because why not
---
I got 4 #1 in a row with 550 shelly and 2 more after a #6 place
---
He also lost all of the gems for the team
---
Turns out making maps on mobile isn't that simple
---
That "RUN" vine/meme song just automatically plays in my mind when I saw this meme if you know what I mean
---
Yeah, and this is not Photoshopped! How crazy
---
Yeah but Shelly isn't the same as tick on this map buddy
---
Homing would to be a new mechanic, I think.
---
Wp still ! ^^^
---
It was. Have you read the patch notes?
---
I agree with you, but in all honesty I'm pretty sure most people would not hand over the title
---
Omg stop posting 500 brawlers its so ez now
---
The main selling point of Piper is her braindead ability to rip fellow sharpshooters apart. That's why she shines in Bounty and Duo.
---
useless
---
This is why Piper in every mode is no longer a meme. She's becoming versatile and useful now.
---
Just like to say as well I have credited r/riochann5230 for making the piper drawing, he really did a great job!
---
didnt have a tablet so needed to use photoshop for a few hours -3-
---
Literally adorable
---
An water bottle
---
Honestly not sure why youre getting downvoted so much. Although she hasnt been *the worst* in a decently long time, she has been very weak for quite a few months now, especially at higher trophies. Im honestly fine with letting her have her time to shine a bit, but Im also fine with nerfing her sp in some time.
---
Please dont kill me like you killed OP Reddit, its just my opinion

---
Yeah, community posts are either low effort, fan art, or memes. If he wanted to make a discussion post, he should not make it using a meme format, but rather a text format so you can talk more about it and get feedback over on r/BrawlStarsCompetitive.
---
Some brawlers will be weaker than others that's a fact, doesnt mean they need a buff
---
The only real truth
---
Brawl ball is love. Brawl ball is life
---
Wrong use of this meme
---
Its a concept and meme at the same time (kinda)
---
no
---
You know the star players is the person who have more kill. You cant choose who will be star player --_--
---
Not when you’re the enemy
---
What about Darryl? Why does Darryl auto charge super? 
---
So that they aren’t weak that’s why
---
Your matchmaking is going to suck. You are going to be with high leveled players. Btw Anyone can push Rosa to 500. It requires no skill.
---
nobody is going to fall for it.
---
499 trophies rip
---
Nice
---
Wish you luck for your account
---
Haha! Do you really think so?
---
If it wasn't for Band-aid shelly is nonexistent at higher trophy matches (except bushy showdown maps of course, I'm considering 3v3) 
---
Shelly is amazing when you start the game, she wrecks almost everyone and mainly because ay low trophies people don't know how to counter her really. 
---
Now, at 10k+ trophies, (before band-aid was introduced) we only saw shelly on like two GG maps (and some were even removed), she sucks at bounty except snake prairie, siege NO, and where we only really saw shelly was in brawl ball to make a more flexible version of frank (wall breaking terms), and an easy tank counter to annoying brawlers like Rosa and El primo.
---
I'd say she is balanced, band-aid gave her some what of an utility at higher level on more maps and not as map dependent as some brawlers like dyna and mortis.
---
Fail at the end
---
Thanks!

---
Yes and Jessie needs another skin.
---
Removed - DO NOT SUBMIT POSTS WITH TITLES IN ALL CAPS. CAPS LOCK IS CRUISE CONTROL FOR COOL
---
I am going to respectfully disagree with you. Rosa, in my opinion, does require some skill as you should know where you should be, who to fight, and when to engage. This goes for all brawlers, not just Rosa. But I did have a lot of trouble pushing her to 500, but I am very proud of it as it is my first brawler to push to 500. It is not my intention to be mean or anything, I’m just saying what I believe. But yes matchmaking is going to be terrible now that I’m here. Especially because I have 0 Star Powers and my highest level brawler is 7.
---
Its not a star power

oh ok
---
Everyone teams, get over it smfh
---
You mean normal x10, big still 3x and mega x1?
---
i mean even if he is a new player it is el primo which is one of if not the easiest brawler to play as with it's high health and high dps close range, besides with the new trophy gain more noob players are rising in trophies meaning that it would be easy to push it.
---
Above 700+, a 50% win rate nets you &lt;=0 trophies. So it takes skill to push to 800 or 900.

Please give credit to the original artist.

---
Yes
---
First of all,im not gonna dovvote.İ have respect on someone else's opinons.Second of all,we all know randoms suck.And you guys maybe played with your team idk but i NEVER played the siege after losing 50 damn trophies. -10 was so bad.Now the game mode is quick,which is better for pushing trophies and if you lose its only -5! It become one of my favorites because its fast-paced.Now maybe winning with first siege bot is op idk they can increase IKE's health or maybe decrease robot's damage but if they make it multiple trophies again I swear to god that i will post a pettion for this siege every single day.
---
OK, i will try.so what do you think about my crap PC art? (not the idea, but just art, couse its just an idea at this point)
---
A brawler being bad (which she wasn't) for any amount of time doesn't justify them having something grossly unbalanced
---
So Darryl’s new star power on gene....
---
Sorry i dont speak despacito
---
r/BrawlstarsP
---
That is not games fault. This kid is only too stupid to play games.
---
Bull just deleted him
---
How you died?
---
That's remind me when I am start the game
---
Actually Darryl's second SP fits Gene, because Gene needs all of his 3 shots to kill some brawlers
---
Damn it I fucked it up
---
Above your comment
---
No he pulls them out his ass
---
Ew that wall
---
Kind of
---
Sure, but there are far more viable picks in all of those modes. I think he will get a buff next update.

Colt was not better as you saw I supered them two times. Also I was at 72 health and I had only 1 powerup. If Colt was switched with Rico I may have not supered them twice and more over I would have missed my shots
---
No I didn't won the Penny's teammate was revived and I had 72 health so yeah..

This is supercell saying

ITS TIME TO STOP

Will it be thiccer then pam?

I'm so confused by the number of people recently showing Bibi as their first or one of the first level 20 brawler. She's a fairly new character and not THAT good compared to a lot of other characters. She's just average. What made you get her to level 20 before other characters you have?
---
Baldi's ammo recharge is much faster
---
YES!
---

Never seen that before. Except I did draw because the time ran out, but not by destroying the boxes simultaneously

yeah so gene with this alternative star power would be able to instakill the brawler he just pulled, therefore helping the team not take damage
---
Alkost 6k and still no brawlers at 500 trophies.
---
Why would you push your shelly to 500. Matchmaking is going to be bad for you. Everyone needs to stop thinking they are good at the game when they get someone to 500. Literally people complain with players like you.
---
Нахуя ты на английском реддите пишешь на русском, уебан? Ах да, ваш Говнесероу вас сюда призвал. Sorry for russian comment, guys.
---
Not impressive. Noobs are getting brawlers to 500.
---
we've all been there
---
I did it for the meme bro. It’s not my real account btw
---
I know right. like what??
---
Brilliant!
---
It basically means: go get a life
---
Bro you are weird why are you calling a skeleton with no peenj hot,this belongs in r/brawlstarsP
---
But I dont, unless I get pinched but that's only to get them to hop off my case I proceed to fight them when everything settles.
---
The only time I would team is if another team is present.
---
He means the ranks of the brawlers, not how much gems or gold he has
---
Oh then it that case lol

*Help me I'm the one in the hospital because of seeing weird posts 😂😂*
---
Her shield needs to be buffed yes, her dmg was already nerfed doesnt need another. And her range is just about the same as bulls if not less.
---
They nerfed her too hard
---
Of course every support should be shit, right? He is HEALER, not SHARPSHOOTER. He is very good, but if you can't use him, than you just suck on him. But that doesn't mean what brawler is bad.
---
Good idea but not in every map. If so only certain walls to avoid cheese.
---
Yeah
---
Yeah, I can see that very clearly now.
---
Lol I get this almost everyday😂 play average 5 hour each day for this result!
---

She needs to be buffed back to the previous nerf because now she feels underwhelming

So i am getting 14 downvotes just because i misinterpreted a joke? 
---
It's really strange that a Dynamike possesses Crow's Star Power.
---
How Shelly ultimate op made my Shelly to rank 20 in 40 min the Shelly need BIG nerf! Especially band aid the op star power!!!
---
That's why I posted to show that trophy pushing has become too easy
---
Ending a game in midair using dynamike, applaud my supreme power.
---
Of course you can use the clip!
---
It has and for your comment I shall upvote
---
Amazing!!! And I specifically like Tara’s cards placement just to avoid drawing Primo nips LOL
---
How? I can't get any mythic at the same tropfies...
---
How does this not have 1k+ upvote what the frick
---
Why does everyone do this... It's better to have checkpoints for all brawlers, instead of maxing certain ones out right away. For example, maybe if your brawlers are all rank 5 you should get all of them to rank 10. Then 15, and 20. Having goals like this is the good thing to do while gettting trophies in my opinion, because things are "Perfectly balanced as all things should be." (sorry i had to).
---
This is actually a romanian sauce... REEEE

---
... Are you okay? Which flowers do you want me to send?
---
Yeah but instead of charging your super with a short range blast and get it faster you can have the longest range in the game but charge your super slower.
---
It's a trade off, doesnt mean he needs a buff.

Nita is unlocked at 10 trophies I believe so I’m going to assume that you are playing with someone at least under 100 overall trophies. This is disgusting matchmaking, plus you have a duplicate teammate which usually doesn’t work out well. Horrible mm and it’s happening to me a lot too where I get mm almost as bad as this. Only started happening since the update though

---
Rico is just trying to be terrifying, even though he is a gumball machine
---
My days had been ruined and my  disappointment is immeasurable
---
The language barrier is super unnecessary too. In french, El Primo is named El Costo to make it sound like "costaud" meaning strong. It ends up translating as "the price". Rico is still named Ricochet. Piper is caller Polly, and Bibi Billy. It's super annoying, like how hard is it to just call him Gene and not Djinn
---
Me and my friend draw dis so he also post dis

This would be useless when play with randoms because you know it

At least have a pre-made copypasta saying *'Sorry, I don't speak \[language\], this message is automated. I speak \[language\].'*
---
Nice! Good!
---
Mythics chance is not changing though its always the same. And i have Tara and Gene. I only need Mortis. I hope i will get the legends though. And yesterday i opened a mega box at 9k trophies and i got only sh!t.

I love how that's actually a real coffee shop xD

You'll have to find out my man
---
Lesgo
---
wth im so sorry
---
I must say i have many diffrent feeling looking at this, its god damn amaozing how much detail you put in those 3d character to look so gosh damn badass thank you for this drawing, aslo cant wait for spike gene and carl x)
---
Exactly. Like attack is the only stat lol. I feel most of the fanbase consists of 7 year old fortnite players who like to go for kills, which is why showdown is so popular. They need to understand that not every brawler is built to be viable in showdown.
---
5 minutes? you madlad
---
I joined, but totally they dont know how to make memes i cant laugh
---
A shaft on a shaft, you say?
---
People are gonna team to kill Leon’s
---
Supers and band-aids
---
Naozaj ja som dal dvesto takych killov ty pojebany cesko
---
this is a joke i just take out of my mine
---
From what I know 69 is also a sex position
---
And 420 is derived somehow from Police code for drugs.
---
The only possible threat I can think is that bo and that tick.Cuz they have 3000 and 4000 trophies.
---
Yay, another crow!
---
SOME BODY ONCE TOLD ME
---
Lmao big bruh moment
---
Hahahaha
---
unless you have opened 500+ boxes in your time playing and have also not gotten any mythics that is normal
---
He is goong to shoot medicine
---
he is basically the reason why boomer parents blame everything on games
---
how dare you assume i am freaking out swine
---
What map is it???
---
Wow !? (:D
---
r/chainbreaker
---
Were here to welcome you to our old, rusty, i place you dont like
---
Wow...
---
Tall guy, not tough guy
---
I think that is bc of this that he have a very high range
---
... Damn this autocorrect I swear...
---
Name proves it point.  Get all the powercubes in the center or scavenge around the outside
---
Its range is pretty good, and your meant to level it up lmao. Most throw varients are like that.
---
8 boxes isn't very much for a legendary
---
Vocal percussion on a whole another level coming through my mind
---
Haha that is cute. Just a mini her using it as a hot tub.
---
Yieeee thank you!!
---
Is she even a girl?
---
What do you mean?
---
So is Mortis
---
Yup, i hope that gene could pull teamates, so you could save your randoms
---
tick is huge
---
Carl is actually the most annoying
---
guy doesnt know how to do double shots yet
---
I dont really like amime but i kinda like this.
---
Yep maybe it’s too difficult lol
---
what?
---
( •̩̩̩̩＿•̩̩̩̩ )
---
not at all just need fast fingers
---
... What does that have to do with the comic?
---
It was a joke xD
---
You sure you want to see Dynamike getting his head choped off?
---
Put carl instead of colt
---
if you have sp it is a ez clap if you know what you are doing tbh
---
Why does Leon look like a girl
---
\[Humor\]
---
I know, I just said
---
I checked your profile on brawl stats and you aren't that good at the game.
---
At this point he doesn't even look like Mike.
---
This is fantastic, a real demonstration of talent. I love that you took the stubby, weirdly-drawn characters from the game and turned them into actual video game/anime style characters.
---
Shows where the world is going though that some can't seem to get over that female characters are drawn feminine (newsflash - most women are) and male ones drawn masculine.
---
Yea I it needs some improvement but I accidentally deleted the file and only have the image left😭
---
Oof
---
Thanks i will delete this comment now
---
Primo was the ingredients
---
Ikr
---
its hard to explain....if you are solo, 1. try wait till u have bandaid before you make a move, 2. positioning is very important, make sure you wont be trapped by teams or find a good spot to trap someone,
---
Imagine ability to walk over the walls
---
He does post a lot of concepts, that's for sure, but they're pretty good, take more effort than most of the things on this sub. But yes lots of Chrono concepts.
---
I noticed that a week ago. not many people noticed.
---
I like the fact that you're like this.
---
client side lighting
---
This is one of those things you didn't realise you needed until you saw it
---
I pulled it off!  Im at 12k now !
---
Amazing art and job! Great work!
---
This would be amazing
---
Well if he has super, or is close to it, and fires 3 shots at Bull from med range (still full damage taken from Gene) and then ults and gets all 3 shots reloaded instantly, he can kill a Bull
---
great
---
wait where is my boy spike , gene and carl also weren't there
---
Why lol when u can win
---
One tile gaps are a nightmare to begin with
---
Middle spawn point too op
---
Then that would change it to an event modifier that isn’t in showdown
---
How?
---
The base idea is nice, and yours make the whole greater!
---
My Over all skill is around 6 if scaled out of 10 so I think I'll take the extra damage from his super 👌
---
Lol this is great :)
---
I figured it was something from anime, based on the style
---
Are you challenging me?!
---
Ale nic jsi nenatočil :P get rekt
---
No no no!  She's still around the 5-6th BEST brawler in the game. I don't think she needs a buff
---
P o p !
---
Stupid question gets a stupid answer
---
...yeah
---
Arent they all?
---
Yes. A regular cactus has TONS of blood in their bodies! ^/s
---
I appreciate your enthusiasm for sarcasm, but indicating it defeats its purpose.
---
Brawl talk will be late august or early september because after their vacation they need at least 2 to 3 weeks of working for the update
---
You really are the worst bot.
---
As user oreoleoreo once said:
---
&gt; /sssshhhhhhhh
---
*I'm a human being too, And this action was performed manually. /s*
---
I suddenly realise why darryl is a pirate he is the horror of the seas
---
Frank said on tiwitter that in the next update there will be non cosmetic items in the star point shop, see you in September!
---
Okay :3
---
If brawl stars was an anime
---
well with the new trophie inflation its not hard tzo farm 5-10 K star points
---
just collect outside boxes in feast or famine and then just camp on outside. I just pushed my shelly up yesterday. From 428 to 500
---
Kill Leons :'(
---
Worst. Bot. Ever.
---
*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. If you're human and reading this, you can help by reporting or banning u/The-Worst-Bot. I will be turned off when this stupidity ends, thank you for your patience in dealing with this spam.*
---
*PS: Have a good quip or quote you want repeatedly hurled at this dumb robot? PM it to me and it might get added!*
---
Nice idea👍
---
 u/elijahTV_youtube
---
Lmao
---
Only if there were no money greedy people involved in that project
---
Lol i play only dous because of teams, Fix showdown please 😂
---
Well, I won't be sleeping soundly tonight.
---
shh the FBI could be knocking
---
We are brawlers too
---
We need this option! You don't know how many times I have died and the opponent I tried to kill has like 260 health remaining, and my teammates do NOT aim for that person! I do NOT understand! (This happens to me more in Gem Grab and the opponent has TEN gems!)
---
The game is free!
---
I am underaged to look at Tara like this. Great job by the artist tho.
---
:'(
---
U want some LOVE don’t you? =)
---
Win 2 Pay 2 Win
---
Why everyone want stupid sans in our beautiful game if you want sans go play it
---
Thanks bro!
---
👏👏👏👏👏👏 cool!
---
Ist cool
---
Thank you bro!
---
Well, Outlaw Colt is Pretty Cheap
---
Of course.
---
Either way, why do Rosa's gloves look like oven mitts?
---
Riiiiiiiight
---
Agreed. Randoms will never aim at the opponent you WANT them to aim at. Trust me. I've had many experiences with this.
---
In September?
---
I'm committing -8.
---
WHEN THE WINGED HUSSARS ARRIVED
---
U BETTER BULL-IEVE IT
---
What about bring both? My teammate keep losing the gems to kill the the enemy teams then run away
---
I tought of this idea way back and no one looked at my post lol
---
My asked my friend to play this game and what they say is the game is too cartoonist and requires top up to reached to the top of this game. I mean wth are those excuses.
---
God, you all kids need to stop this.
---
If Supercell hasn't added this after all this time, is because they don't want or they just can't. 3 shitty posts about it every day won't make them change their mind
---
*im jealous*
---
Just... You'll see!
---
This happened to me 1 time before the trophy buff, i got 200 trophies in one night
---
What is this shitty post?
---
Thank you!!
---
Hehe I kinda did that... It does look like oven mitts now seeing it...
---
As simple as this: if the post is about **deleting** something, the post is just stupid and useless
---
I hate that There is no subreddit only for brawl stars fan ideas and this one should be for memes
---
I love this idea
---
r u Weeb?
---
HAHAHAHAHHAA
---
he don't have his third sp on this update
---
So you wanted to buy the gems legally and didn't expect to get refunded?
---
Its true
---
On brawl stars Twitter
---
Hah!
---
To be fairer........
---
I have already seen this post before, that's why I said that it was a repost OR stolen
---
Because Mortis was too op
---
Their twitter isn't on vacation though...
---
Agreed
---
JOJO

we need this!!

I was just about to ask whether or not you can buy the new Star Powers in the shop with gold. Guess not.
---
HOLY SHIT YES
---
wow that's a good idea! :D
---
Naisu Naisu, very nice, Kaisai chan.
---
Then you're all missing the point.  You can then at least see which enemy your random teammate IS aiming at and at very least could attempt to follow THEIR lead to maximize results.  Maybe it's not the proper target or who YOU chose to go after, but would still give opportunity to work better with a teammate.
---
So is Nita jessie Dynamike (the canary) pam (sort of) and Penny!
---
Yeah hi
---
In my life so give it to me
---
Wait third star power
---
Actually I dont like these kind of art but this one ITS JUST DIFFERENT I like you style of drawing robots
---
r/unexpectedlazytown ?
---
Perfect
---
No
---
Im at 9k and dont have leggies neither tara and gene.
---
Nice 1
---
Try harder. The Box is useless
---
You can for sure, they cost 2000, but they never show up! Game really wants me to spend 169 gems which is a rip off
---
Bruh bot sucks
---
Good
---
F to the nita
---
WTF is this third star power
---
Nice Matchmaking
---
yea but i don't see the thing working underwater

Why do you have 1000000 gems? (55000€)
---
U
---
That already exists
---
Nice one my firsts were spike and leon too!
---
Bringer of bats
---
I doubt they'll have an option to unlock a new brawler as it would cut into their gem sales revenue. It'll probably be just boxes and keep the guaranteed items locked behind gems.
---
Dash and destrooooooy
---
Slice and dice!
---
Youuuu have been bested
---
please supercell add this for real lol
---
Don't take it too seriously. Anyway, of coure every brawler if well played can be ranked, but Poco in gem grab actually feels so strong. I mean, when the opponent team has Poco and yours hasn't you often feel overwhelmed by his insane range and healing. But as I've already stated, it's just a joke, I wasn't claiming for a nerf.
---
Noooooo!
---
its ok
---
They will lose money tho
---
That is not under rates.
---
Stop complaining.
---
3 mega boxes = 30 boxes
---
You get 1 star power (on average) every 100 boxes, and brawlers are rarer than boxes (assuming you have all rares and super rares), so you’re not under rates.

Too bad
---
What?
---
Some of them feel way to tall, and primo is a bit too white lol, but amazing art
---
;-; 12.4k no legy
---
Wow, dick.
---
I'm just complaining about the fact that I pushed every single one of my brawlers to rank 15 and got nothing to show for it twice (the third being that 49 gem offer)
---
Time to rest
---
If I’m gonna get killed by a sniper bot at least make it look good
---
Hey, can I use your clip for my moment video? I'll give your credit. Here is a link to my channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGXabWn_lg21jdkkcGzQP1g?app=desktop
---
We shall meet again
---
Not the best idea ever;
---
1. Not everyone has not Shelly brawlers
---
2. The price is different between skins
---
3. They will lose alot of money
---
I wood buy this
---
??? What type of comeback is that? “Dick. I am complaining too bad.”
---
How long ago you started playing?
---
It’s good but ya know It’s not a brock skinn
---
Your soul is mine
---
Maybe too useful for the devs to be cool with?

---

---
Wow, I can't believe you got that far with your Brawlers, with such a low power level
---
im at 9k with 20 brawlers still under power 5
---
LEGENDS ARE FOR THE WIN!!!!
---
?
---
And he already has leon so lucky
---
No you will can't accept the skin for the brawler you don't have
---
Oh ok
---
I  think the star power is too cheap
---
Look at the boss on the left
---
Carl:*wink*
---
How long spikes legs look makes me uncomfortable
---
I hope you find a legendary
---
I beat a power cube 7 colt with a no cube poco. My best win
---
Everyone is so stupid, dont you get the damn joke. Nita is a bear she kicks the ball with her bare feet, ya dumb asses.
---
He's also my 2nd most trophy brawler (410 trophies). I gotta use him a lot to maintain him at that position.
---
Haha only the snipey one
---
What’s the skull?
---
I like it bit i think my phone will constantly crashing with this loading screen
---
please
---
But*
---
Ur all retarded 
---
The brawlers throw it with their hands!
---
Congrats, he is trash
---
I hope he review your meme because its fantastic
---
Woah that’s cool. Well done!
---
When you play against auto-aimers, anything is possible
---
It's dragon knight jessie
---
There’d be an animation for every character and they would be randomly cycled. It would be shorter, I just made it longer to showcase more character animations. And thanks for the feedback 😃
---
Well look how many trophies I have and the differences between yours. All I am doing is just getting my keys and tokens.
---
It is
---
Woah sick
---
So you are an anti vax?
---
Np! It looks awesome and it'd would be amazing if Supercell implemented this. It's a very unique idea!
---
No, I' m not. Jessie is good brawler.
---
Glitchstars (*only undertale fans got it*)
---
LOL
---
Nope
---
 Darrly: This is fine i dont have a voice
---
It suskcs, I wish after matching on trophies, they mixed up power levels between the teams to make the average power level the same across both teams.
---
Understand you can’t do it if people want to play together, but they should do it for all the random players.
---
They should make it if you are not there you will not win or lose trophies
---
This posted as a YouTube vid?
---
Ok my bad it’s not 
---
I’m dumb
---
Legendary 0.09...%
---
Mythic 0.2...%
---
what about just give skins like a present for anyone..
---
What is it then
---
Agreed. Supercell tends to ignore balance and go for more profiting ways at time. New brawlers, skins, etc. Some problems they just don’t fix. Kind of what happened to COC. Added too many things and it became impossible to balance.
---
This is my fav crow skin, I’m trying hard to get the star tokens for him. Never wanted a skin that badly before 😭

I've made smth like this after the teaser trailer
---
No, you can get both and select one of them but up until you get the other one you have to use the one you got first.
---
Is sad because Tick is a pirate robot like Darryl, and he just die :(
---
6k and doesnt even have gene xx
---
Good job, it's AMAZING.
---
4K? I didn't get my first legendary until I was at 5K! Some people dont even have them at 12K!! Im at 7.5K with my only legendary as Crow and I dont complain!! You need to chill and have patience. Good things come to those who wait, especially for legendaries in brawl stars.
---
But he ranked up
---
You should've posted this on Clash Royale, Brawl Stars is the most free to play-friendly game they have and it's like 100x more free to play friendly than any of their games. i'm free to play and easily max my brawlers and go up in cups.
---
Cool!!
---
That’s what it should look like I mean in the animation the walls look gigantic but in the game they are as the same height as the brawlers
---
Lrwarb beta
---
I tried to do my best
---
4k? I got my first legendary at 6.5k and I'm still missing a mythic and 2 legendaries at 9k
---
Kind of, but game mechanics are diffrent (at least I don't remember red and blue kings fighting each other in CoC
---
In just saying he doesn’t need a buff and your not that bad bud
---
Not at all, this video really includes imprisoned Tick's head

This makes me uncomfortable
---
U mean some sort of new mode right? Cool, but needs some polishments
---
dude you are very lucky some people  have 6k with 20 throphies

---
Thanks a bunch!
---
so only one or two people will get it? or is this available for everyone?
---
ok but this is plain disrespectful to frank and ryan, at least say supercell or something instead of their names dude, idc if this comment makes me lose karma this is just outrageous at this point, at the end of the day, the game is supercell’s, if u have problems with it, dont disrespect these hardworking people and stop playing. easy.
---
Thanks so much

Brawler level doesn't mean that the player is actually good, its just means that he is 40% stronger than you.
---
Is it unfair? Maybe, but it's not illegal for you to max a brawler and then make a mess at base range trophy.

Supercell could change the matchmaking to fit this new demand? Of course they could, but why, they're at the same "experience level" of you guys?
---
Matchmaking really sucks by now, but at my sight, it's completely fair.
---
I'm not here to criticize you, just look at the big picture, level means nothing but power, if you can't control it, its useless.  
---
Remember Uncle Ben's last words.
---
P.S. Even if you're powerfull, you can always be destroyed by a LVL 1 PrO pLaYeR. Precision, Movement and Position is EVERYTHING in this game.

“having or showing a great lack of intelligence or common sense” - seems to describe your comments perfectly.

Please let me know what other concepts I could make and you all would like to see. If I see an idea, I will most likely make it.

It's different from computer or smartphone but pratically you just need to go on the subreddit (ex: r/brawlstars) then on the options you will find "user flair" then select yours and its done

Yea one random helped me to get 300 trophies and i also helped him. And im still waiting to him to accept my friend request
---
Yeah.  No hats team to much.
---
it looks great, but i feel like the transitions between brawlers could be smoother.
---
This looks like a repost.
---
Yeah but when I try actually playing mortis as an assassin it seems extremely hard to actually walk up to the people to kill them.
---
I got 17😜😂

You’re probably at lower trophies and playing with bad players.  It’s one of the best heist maps in the game rn.
---
I know what you mean, tho.  Games on my 3000 mini account are like that, but not on my 10K main.
---
Gene???
---
That’s normal
---
They’re not wrong,

But it takes so long to charge. I prefer this one,
