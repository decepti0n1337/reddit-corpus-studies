In fact this'll be pretty cool i imagine having an event where theres a new skin but you have to get it up in fragments (say this skin is golden colt) such as shiny shoes or golden magum guns and such for 400 star tokens
---
---
---
Solution1: don't play as Carl
---
Solution2: off sounds and music (I'm serious)
---
How many trophies with your brawler?
---
Luck .. i got mortis n crow in two days last week
---
Landscape and portrait were fundamentally two different games
---
It definitely is a secondary consideration, at least. I remember I never got matched up with any Bo's in the game, until I hit 3000 trophies and unlocked him myself.
---
If you want to you can look up matchmaking in this subreddit and the top post is good proof, but you don't have to look at it. I do believe that people should not complain about it constantly since it is sort of a rare occurrence, but I feel that the developers should look into the problem and hopefully find a solution.

I play 20 mins a day but I still was able to push my leon to 640 and my primo to 600. Showdown is very helpful and the matches take like 3 mins

i agree teaming is awful but don't goddamn go and act like you're a teamer then use them then kill them you're still teaming u asshole. yes this happened to me back when i was a noob and i used to team
---
don't hate ive changed
---
Yes every map rn too. Bandaid needs to be nerfed
---
Seems like ur complaining
---
Most people will be willing to let the other go ahead, because why should you care when you are getting all of the bolts?(except penny, never trust a missing penny)
---
what's the original name of this movie?
---
Sadly the graphics have nothing to do with internet lag, though.
---
I would love to know why this game is consistently laggier than anything else I've ever played, and why it seems fine on LTE vs WiFi, though.
---
Because 12 year olds.
---
I don‚Äôt get it
---
No one cares about ur unboxing
---
This is not related to this subreddit
---
Why care? Because common sense indicates that siege was already a mode where diving was dangerous and now the IKE has less health so duh
---
Mmmm yummy snack for mortis

Last season I got to top 100 shelly
---
Aw you, i really laugh on how she was like fish moving like crazy. 
---
By the way, if like it i want make another fanart of your oc, just tell me who you want and i promise more effort.
---
Have a nice day
---
Why should you care? This video is why. Diving was dangerous in the old siege and now the IKE just has less health so it‚Äôs even more so. People forget that a primary objective for siege is protect your IKE. Letting the enemy past you means you‚Äôre failing a primary objective. When the enemy attempts this. Kill them. You‚Äôve protected your Ike and the enemy surrendered mid control and ta-da you have a bot
---
Lol yeah. Last season I was top 100 shelly
---
I lost 7
---
How

I really hope this post was a joke.....

Hmm I think he is referring to Carl‚Äôs Head compared to the other skins in the shop where they are idle üòÇ

Kill it
---
Battle passing werent really much of a thing though( I in my own experience came from like fornite and pubg ) and now that supercell has released it for coc and CR they will release one for BS soon, it took them 6ish years for it to release for coc and 4ish years for CR. I doubt it'll take 4 years for them to do it on BS

OOF

Bounty is fun lol, but siege is terrible.

You just don‚Äôt know how to counter. Learn how to play.

Spike has captured Darryl

You mean the loading screen?

We don‚Äôt care if your friend and Piper and you don‚Äôt. It really isn‚Äôt that big of a deal. 
---
You have a legendary - that is great for your trophy level. Spike is an amazing Brawler. 
---
Stop acting so entitled. Once you get Piper you are going to complain about her as well - she has her own set of challenges.

Cool

---
It depends. I never go on the clans sub but have went on royales and obviously this one multiple times.  
---
A lot of the posts I see on Royale I don't care about, they really are replays, decks, stuff that doesn't matter to me. The art is cool. Concept creating just downgraded there though, you hardly see any high effort concepts there anymore, unlike here where you see concepts everyday that are pretty cool.  
---
Another thing is just how I felt I couldn't speak my opinion on anything in that sub. I felt like I wasn't able to talk about how I felt about a card unless I wanna get bombarded with people saying "well look at the numbers here" and crap. I also felt if I said I didn't like a feature supercell made _cough cough_ pass royale _cough cough then people won't respect my opinion.  
---
This sub has lots of kids, yes, but has lots of mature people here imo, or maybe I'm wrong idk, but I definitely have a better experience here than I do in the Royale sub.
---
El emooooo
---
Lmao i got that 2 times too
---
Nerf shelly
---
thats okay cause most content creators post artwork in the form of concepts! most content creators post skin ideas to show off their art skills, not the actual concept. 
---
if you wanna makea good concept, presentation is equally important (your drawing skills) but keep in mnd these rules:
---
1) BS is kid friendly and anything too scary/bloody is outta the question
---
2) BS has a simplistic style so the most complicated ideas should be like bibi's decorative jacket and not go any further
---
3) take physical mechanisms into consideration, especially during attack
---
4) Xtras! A very complete skin requires attack animation as well. In this case, you might substitute shelly's shells with tiny arrows so it would make more sense
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
of course, other innovations are also welcome but gotta make sure it is easy to recognize as a skin of the brawler
---
Hey a human Sakura Spike picture that's not cursed

Just push all your 500 a little over 500 lmao you will get at least 100 every season

Nah just a normal me gusta man

This is an actual star power but it was scrapped so we are never gonna see it.
---
Time to discover the mysteyry of history
---
Yes it is. It is an actualy star power but it was scrapped so we are never gonna see t in game probably.
---
I waaaas one of the mortis'
---
Knowing supercell, they will just remove the walls to "fix" it
---
Mmhmm let's check the following two examples:
---
You and me have both 100 boxes sitting with an update (and a new brawler) coming tomorrow. You open them all today and I open them all tomorrow. Who of us has the highest chance to get the new brawler?
---
We well get it but in next time not now
---
What's with Galadon?
---
How about yes but not not right now
---
Copyright issues: yes
---
But the sub can now make memes of carl using Captain America quotes
---
Well...Mr. Paul how about show some love and respect to yourself.

So?

This would be supercell being lazy and saying that bull is now the top shotgunned again instead of fixing band-aid. Would also be a significant nerf to Frank and primo.
---
We've been tricked We've  been backstabbed and quite possibly bamboozled
---
Team,play,lose.
---
Oh I know this, didn't notice, good catch.

May be yes, just a little bonus for 1st win.

It's an old strategy to win the game üòÅ

u for example have  mortis

What else is there

clashroyale is the worst one. 80%+ people there hate the game. ice spirit jump, 2v2 clone 3 star, stupid balance ideas. there are even people who think that art and memes should have separate sub , that's like half the posts and it would make the sub even more inactive.
---
Noice
---
Love the earings and the casual pose.
---
I don‚Äôt tho, I play 2 hours a day
---
Whenever There Are 2 Mortis In The Game,38% Of The Time They Team
---
It would be even cooler,If the brawler is a different one every time you log in
---
Trikshot posted it but it's all organized by supercell
---
So that would take literally 20 years to get golden mecha

That‚Äôs not how you spell it. You spell it

Happy=good

200 I think
---
agreed. but shelly is also character for noobs, you don't even have to try playing as her, just bushcamp and spam your autoaim the whole match and boom you get 10 trophies
---
Not a map that will make it in-game, this is rather **for entertainment purposes only**. This showdown map is called **Mario Mayhem**.
---
Various objects and items from the familiar **Super Mario** franchise surround the map with the likes of *bricks, question blocks, coins, pipes* and the big *mushroom* which takes up the middle. 
---
Each corner makes the players very cautious of not getting killed immediately by a brawler whilst attempting to obtain the power crates. The familiar objects and items use up quite a lot of bushes, and you obviously know what that means ;)
---
This was just for the love of Mario and I had a lot of fun making this map. Enjoy :)

imagine that logo at 20 000 trophies on the Trophies Road and you get one legendary skin of your choice
---
Hi dad, he is shaking
---
My main account has almost 6k trophies with no legendaries, yet I got Leon on my mini account at 800 total trophies
---
That is lwarb beta man
---
It means be teams, it means he has no honour, he doesn't fight like a man, he has to team up and 2v1 to kill, it means his trophies weren't from skill but just spinning, just a repetitive circular movement.
---
The Jessie didn‚Äôt even spin and I found that disrespectful
---
I m just good at this game i got 10 300 wins in 3vs3 i play since the beta so 2 years agoo i got some little account and this game is very very easy i know a lot of top players etc...
---
Good but could you made poco or mortis

Hate playing against 5 shellys every match on this map and any Sd map in general. Why she's still in the condition she is in, I have no idea

Smoking is good üëçüö¨üëå

Ah yes your a man of a god

i only got 16

I'd say its either Brock or Penny, but with this new star power, Piper is going to dominate
---
Frank super?
---
No, the lock screen
---
Mortis wIthout hat is bad
---
What do you mean?
---
Wtf 16 in 3vs3 sd player = toxic
---
How they can get in the middle.The bouncer traps in normally throws plsyer farter?
---
I think it's solo showdown or brawl ball (but you Need a good team), showdown it's because you dont need to depend on team mates and you can also Bush Camp so it's also Easy sometimes, brawl ball its because if you have the right skills you can end a match even in less than 10 seconds (but that Needs also noob opponents)
---
Honestly you had a bit advantage I don't know why you're complaining
---
Whwn mortis dash gains a sheild reduce the damage he take by 30% for 0.8 sec

Flair checks out

You say that, but unless someone sent you a screenshot, that is your account &gt;.&gt;
---
Recursion...
---
Because you can destroy the safe in like a minute and in solo showdown you can just camp to farm trophies..
---
are you 7 years old?
---
I can say this is true for both sieges,  because :
---
Old siege: high risk, possible bad randoms= lots of trophies lost
---
New siege: too short, resulting in overly insane comebacks
---
 I know the name meme is not creative
---
This is why I dont play showdown
---
No, we can see if Mortis has the coiled snake as enemies
---
I really like this map but it probably wont be accept because there always have to be two free tiles between walls. please revise it and post again
---
She is a starter brawler, she is supposed to be squishy and weak
---
The frick
---
:(
---
Theres a bit of an exageration, even by winning 90% of your games, pushing 1k a day takes a lot of hours. You dont do that everyday unless you play all day. Im a 20k player and I know what I‚Äôm talking about
---
Frankception
---
I have roughly 4000 trio wins (almost all of them with randoms) and I do NOT confirm this.
---
This is not a stereotype. Just because you played good enough to make up for bad players doesn't mean they are decent.
---
If they were as good as you say then your winrate with randoms should be close to your winrate with premades.
---
Why is this brawl stars in a nutshell? It is just you playing some matches with Rosa
---
Nobody is born cool execpt of course

That meme template

This is amazing, but you should of put your name on it somewhere

No, this not beat deal in game. You should wait 1400x2 for39 gems. Or 900x2 for 29 gems. They are best deals(sorry for bad englishXD)

Don‚Äôt you think it should be more easier to unlock brawlers of higher rarity as you go higher in trophies?
---
Like in clash royale,the higher the arena the higher the legendary chances
---
It‚Äôs so hard to get mythics and legendaries as a f2p player 
---
I myself am at 10.4k and missing only Tara and crow but I have friends who are at 12k-15k with 0 leggies which is why I think it should be made easier to unlock those brawlers in future update of course
---
Perfect heart bro

Solo showdown isn‚Äôt broken. Band Aid Shelley isn‚Äôt broken. Do you play Band Aid Shelley in Heist?? No. Do you play Gene in Gem or showdown. You YouTubers I swear are the least intelligent people on the planet. Thank God we have the Devs, if players like you ran the game it wouldn‚Äôt even exist or be popular. You guys literally have no clue what you‚Äôre doing. I‚Äôve also beaten you in 3v3 Ash you‚Äôre not that good. You wanna impress a bunch of 11 year olds go ahead. Nobody over the age of 11 takes you seriously. And stop talking out of your butt when it comes to solo showdown

Thank you bro! You're one of the few YouTubers that I regularly watch (and that's something special bc I don't really watch many youtubers haha!)

---
i am 12k and i do not fear any legendary could you tell supercell to put more likely to play a legendary
---
that is 3 too many brawlers for it to be possible, much less probable...
---
Ahhh me UK
---
perfection
---
Ty!!!!!!
---
Why SUPERCELL didn't remove solo showdown mode and just keep duo showdown when the game was in beta?
---
Does that actually hit Ike? Can't tell from this video but it looks slightly out of range.
---
Yes there were. I killed a few little bots (that I hadn‚Äôt needed to pull to arrange yet) to charge super. Those robots would respawn after a few seconds you killed them
---
You're one of my favorite youtubers along with few other pro players, big reason is different continents (pro contents) unlike other youtubers who post such a random and useless videos like spin the wheel, worst brawlerson  this worst brawlers on that
---
I really really hope that you will never do that
---
And always choose quality over quantity
---
My question is
---
Do you think some star power needs buff or change? (like gene's his both sp is trash for me as a player who plays showdown, even poco got sp that works solo) and obviously nerfs, which sp you think needs nerf first being band-aid?
---
So you ara the lucky man I look for

&gt; I think it will stay relevant for a very long time. Of course it's very difficult to predict the future, but I believe Brawl Stars is moving in the right direction. Just today we got news about a $250,000 tournament! I can't wait to take part in that.
---
Not symmetrical
---
Really?
---
I had a Rico like that
---
no, dude, in most games starting characters are weak, brawl stars and other supercell's games are exceptions
---
aw alright
---
Nah, I personally didn‚Äôt experience it. But there were a lot of YouTube videos and reddit posts back then about it.
---
i know, i was ina ll of those streams
---
I want this map to be added instead of Eye of the Storm (there are 14 maps that appear every season) so I can finally get my Piper, Brock and Tara to 500+ (Tara because there r so many boxes in the center)
---
My ears lol,but this has already been done here: [www.youtube.com/QYnbdksPjs](https://youtu.be/lXMskKTw3Bc/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)
---
I'd never buy it for almost 300 gems
---
Good idea, I‚Äôd also add ammo
---
I never pack brawlers in big or mega box only box
---
Where do you think she hinds those bombs
---
Thanks
---
What?
---
Thanks for some constructive criticism, unlike that other b****.
---
Could you make a full version of that kazoo loss theme please? So much meme potential lol
---
Honestly tho
---
I got Mortis to 500 as lvl 2. I know me suck
---
It's really good but. There's a lot of crow skins like a lot.
---
aww maan
---
At that point teaming is a understandable strategy, you team with/against the strongest brawler for securing higher rank, this doesn't always happen i have fought many battles where strong brawler fight each other &amp; the brawler with 1 Power cube wins . But doing teaming from start is pure toxic removes the fun of solo showdown you are forced to join them or get killed by them.
---
I think that‚Äôs good, I was top 32 Carl in Ukraine with 3K but there are less pros than in U. S.
---
I like the idea,  2 tips for you: 
---
1- remove the last sentence of your post about not being rude.  
---
People don't like being told how to act,  and a troll is gonna be a dick anyway,  maybe moreso because of this
---
2- try to illustrate your idea,  even if it's poorly made on windows paint,  is more effective than a random screenshot. 
---
Also,  just a bonus,  maybe check out r/brawlstarsnextlevel,  we love concept ideas
---
I disagree, I really do. You‚Äôre just jealous of new players getting legendary brawlers. The luck part of the game is already fair, also a legendary won‚Äôt make the new player better, imagine if a new player got spike and then can‚Äôt use it because he‚Äôs kinda tricky to play compared to a shelly that he already got. I agree with the person you replied, but your second idea is insanely good.
---
Thank you so much!!!!!!
---
I think they did you a favor anyway,  mega boxes aren't worth the money
---
Sorry but u should rework it so much
---
Thanks!
---
The mortis should be the winner. The no powercube shelly doesn't deserve it. She never know what service is.

I‚Äôve seen primo do this MANY times but only in &lt;5k trophies. I hate to admit it but I accidentally did this when i played primo. I never play him and he has a super you cant just click(professionally). I launched to the other side into a shelly and they took all the gems. Then you dont have your super to get back to the other side. 7 seconds left before you get to mid. Its the ultimate shame.

i know but some of them still take the power ups even though no one is around

Because my every game is against people with max half of my trophies range (and i'm constantly complaining about it), which is 13k.

Then be different. Do something outside the box. Be creative. Maybe make a silly comic or draw a funny meme (very popular on this sub). Just don‚Äôt do stuff like this. It makes you look like you‚Äôre only here for attention, and you make good art. Don‚Äôt waste it on things like this
---
Guys why do you guys get so mean to things like this? I didn‚Äôt steal whosever heart nor was I aware of their posts on here before. I saw my friend created his initials by Gene, then I wanted to create a heart myself, and now intentionally shared this on reddit to show love to a special guy in my clan (since he is a reddit guy) without showing him directly. He is the first comment if you wonder whom

I didn‚Äôt know it was possible. Started spinning on her though.
---
RIP Rey got denied

Probably still poco.

Except of course, people who kill teamers

Thank you, took me more than 1hr üòñ

Maybe. She did lob her heals out. That would have been awesome too.
---
A lot of new star powers look disappointing (for ex: leon, pam, spike), they are extremely underwhelming compared to shelly's
---
aaaaah yours is freakin cool
---
The fact is that you need to change the mind of the person who uses him for showdown.
---
I actually play rlly well as tick in duo showdown

Great in many Duos though, but solo is laughable since screeching solo doesn‚Äôt scale with cubes.
---
I went on my friends account and lost him 200 trophys
---
Exactly, how much brawlers?
---
How? Piper‚Äôs new star power isn‚Äôt in-game yet
---
How could such a low effort image send such a meaningful message?
---
Ah yeah, killing a person with 3000 powercube just because *YOU LITTERALLY IS CLICKING ONE FUCKING BUTTON WITH 0 POWERCUBES* is balanced
---
Bait their super, and down they go.
---
Haha...nice meme
---
Genes star powers are pretty garbage
---
I mean if the Poco isn't going to do much with the power cubes he might as well bring his teammate 6 or 7.
---
Yea pretty much. And then there‚Äôs the global players in our matchmaking...
---
I was about to have a mental breakdown when I saw 69 but luckily it was something mature. Thank god. Also, yeah in the same boat as you. Watch them suddenly remove star points before we can spend them without compensation.
---
It‚Äôs too easy for squishy brawlers to get cornered and mid feels nothing but hectic and favoring bush campers
---
Use long range brawlers or throwers she can't really deal with those, she has less health and speed than tanks. Shelly is an easy target for these brawlers.
---
‚ÄúBug‚Äù
---
How did you do that?
---
I've played against this same rico two times in a row, Lost both for this reason
---
I propose a little change to his SP
---
Pat on the back: when shoots his super in a friendly they gain 1000 hp and a speed boost
---
Magic puffs: heal teammates around you for 330 every 1.2 or 1.1 seconds
---
Twice for replies
---
Well it is better for them to play that brawler, than a brawler that actually takes a decent ammount of skill. I don't want to imagine how bad my autistic bull and el primo randoms would be doing if they would use someone like piper or mortis.
---
Ehhh repost but it‚Äôs been a like a year since this was last on this sub
---
100% accurate.
---
Although I will admit, fast el primo changes things a bit about spacing.
---
Looks awesome man!
---
In pvz its almost impossible to win with the first plant or zombie. Stop that you fricking peanut brain that doesnt know how to play. You have a small pp
---
N U T
---
literally every longrange brawler and thrower that is good enough at checking bushes, how is a shelly supposed to kill them?
---
I was wearing headphones and turned on the volume and I jumped :/
---
A really solid piper player is actually kind of scary.
---
I am dieing hep me
---
Well his first one is pretty decent if you can coordinate with your team. Your damage player just has to keep close when you have your super ready so they can clean up after you pull with the heal making sure they‚Äôre recovering some hp before/during/after you pull
---
You‚Äôre spot on with the second though :)
---
Yeah but I wasn't talking about good players. Random Pipers are interesting tho. They are either literally retarded or fricking masters. Only in bounty they can be mediocre.
---
Don't shake morti &gt;_&lt;
---
whats the bug
---
Jaja asies
---
And every close range lol
---
?
---
fair enough.
---
lately I've been lucky to land a team of really good randoms and then ride them out for about 20+ matches.  not all wins, but always damn good.
---
No one:
---
Pretty much everyone: Sometimes calls rico ricochet, even though it was changed several months ago.
---
The most interesting thing about it is, that many people actually called ricochet rico already before his name change
---
r/beatmetoit
---
how would she fly
---
Except for long range or throwers.
---
bushcamp thing works only on low trophies, no one checks the bushes there

Guys obviously it‚Äôs a joke that Leon is a Girl
---
r/youruinedthechain
---
Where?
---
So you don't understand the shrek reference
---
what a waste of cash
---
She‚Äôs bad in most 3v3 before trophy rework. Bad in gem grab, bounty, and heist. Pretty bad to ok in brawlball. Showdown is map dependent. Also in brawlball also map dependent.
---
Lol, you were watching me
---
100% calculated.
---
well yes but actually no
---
That would be awesome. You spelled chaos wrong tho

Please criticize as necessary. Also, sorry about the formatting. If it says ‚ÄúAttack‚Äù, ‚ÄúSuper‚Äù, or ‚ÄúStar Powers‚Äù, everything under those words is describing that thing.
