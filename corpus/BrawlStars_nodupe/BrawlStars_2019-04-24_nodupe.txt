I think he‚Äôs mad about double primo?
---
---
---
Bruce wouldn‚Äôt do such a thing, Leon is just a jerk!
---
üòîüòî
---
Are u dumb? Like literally he will become like he was first released...I hope he gets another nerf lol, he is still broken af
---
cool
---
I would rather have a button that says "hate teammates" so it's useful when the randoms use Crow and run into a bull.
---
You missed the part: Create a monopoly in a town and make the sheriff codependent to you
---
&lt;3
---
There‚Äôs a one percent chance of getting a star power so normal luck would have you get one star power per every 100 boxes
---
Yeah, I guess it is your experience.
---
Ay mortises and mikes yall gangstas till i pull one of ya into a bull or a shelly. The judgement day will come when genes will arise.
---
DENIED
---
My question isn‚Äôt the two swipes but the question of why are you playing crow like hull
---
Mortis: You call teaming a strategy?
---
Dynamike: Hey, as long as it works.
---
Shet üíî
---
Dude are you high or somethin'? Piper is definetly not a good GC. Low health brawlers and sharpshooters (Btw Piper is both) are **not** GC.
---

---
While she is not bad in this map, she is **definetly** not S tier.
---
If I were to adjust your list, I would bring Gene to S tier, he is one of the best brawlers to use in this map.
---
Probably. Everytime a brawler comes out, you can buy it.
---
Seems like he is in denial.
---

By relying on predictions you have to aim your shots into the spot that you think that person is going to. So you're aiming your shots. If you're trying to make sense, you're doing the complete opposite. I know what rank 17-18 look like and I don't find the harder than rank 15. If you really think Dynamike is complicated then consider using Barley.
---
??? Lmao no
---
Ahh lol but I‚Äôve never payed
---
I did that on purpose to show it off.
---
FaNtAsTiCo!
---
My barley and dyna are almost at the same trophy level lmao, and I do make sense, you're just too dumb to understand me. Rank 1-15 is very different from 17-20+
---
Haha! That‚Äôs also another point. I really liked this comic, keep it up üëçüòä
---
Are you sure it‚Äôs not photoshop?
---
1% people who really listen the music
---
99% TIK TOK
---
I actually put gene there on accident, hes A tier
---
And i think you're ok piper shouldn't be S tier she should be at least A or B, being fragile is a problem but you need to know how to position yourself and not getting bodied by the carts, that makes her less viable than the others, but its mostly skill based and positioning
---
It‚Äôs actually a she and her name is Winnie ü•∞
---
Exactly
---
Ahhhh the beta fossil site
---
Thank you! I have a lot more planned in the future... A LOT.
---
No he has three, his minecart has one
---
Thank you so much
---
Yeah let‚Äôs get another bag
---
You're welcome
---
Yeah ig ur right didn‚Äôt really put two and two together. I have a decent amount of trophies but not enough to call myself pro lol.
---
flair checks out
---
People forgetting about the OG vector, tf2's demoman
---
I‚Äôm trying to not use my brawlers above 300 anymore. I got really lucky and got almost every brawler except Tara and Leon by 2000 ish trophies so for the past 2500 trophies I‚Äôve been trying to get all my brawlers up to 150 and then to 300.
---
Yea sure that sounds really cool
---
I guess you could say we NITA art
---
Emojis are my norm tho lmao and you dont know what triggered means if you think I'm triggered lol
---
They were simpler times.  Seems so long ago
---
Damn, alright that one got me...
---
nah bro. nobody really cares, there are hundreds of the same posts. you are not different
---
#But it feels to good on me
---
Pulling them into a mine cart works just as well lol.
---
I always thought Leon and Nita were siblings.
---
Well then maybe just save the last replay for a couple minutes or so. Otherwise in the future there are going to be a lot of players above 400 anyways so whats the point
---
How old is Tara? Asking for a friend
---
Me too
---
Yeah lol I‚Äôm not even gonna try
---
Looks good to me.
---
Ikr same üòÇüòÇ
---
That‚Äôs a good point. I usually screen record it if I really like the play and all I need is 5 minutes to do that.
---
This is the Spongebob game? No. So this is ok. It's original and would be nice. Don't worry about. Just enjoy.

good idea
---
Maxxed account, opened a bunch of boxes to get Leon (too many, still ended up buying him RIP) and Gene, I've been saving boxes for Rosa but I still have sooo many coins left - like enough to buy 30+ SP's lmao
---
There was a bug where maxed Crow made poisoned Gene deal super damage, but not pull targets. Do you prefer this, the current one or the previous one, where the hand didn't cross over walls?
---
Hey, that's pretty good
---
DON‚ÄôT JUMP YOU HAVE SO MUCH TO LIVE FOR!!!!

The teaming dynamike part was funny af
---
*wheezing laughter at how funny this is*
---
God damn it Bob!
---
That‚Äôs good! I think she‚Äôll be around 43 boxes to get her so just keep saving! I think I have 2 &amp; 16

The speed isn't very fast, you can dodge it

Piper whipped out her gunbrella
---
Your best work until now! 
---
# Amazing!
---
he just gets hard countered by a lot of brawlers...he is quite good once you get his star power. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
i would say play him in gem grab as either a gem carrier or aggro against squishies. he's also decent on some bounty maps when its thrower heavy.
---
I mean he's a skeleton
---
Srry :v
---
r/elprimogang
---
Smartass crow
---
I feel like Penny is also a good choice. She‚Äôs slightly tankier than Piper and Barley, she can offer good control due to the nature of the map. Her mortar can be placed so that the enemy have to deal with one more threat. My preference as gem carrier in the map in place of Piper
---
It got removed in beta cuz of teaming
---
Ohhh thanks
---
What game mode do you primarily play with Darryl?

you're not really wrong, but it seems like he's really just making sure suggestion

Ouch

YES

This is some good comic style

Pronoun game is a little annoying, are you referring to how bricks shoulder passes through his rocket a bit? Box that‚Äôs really minor

Thanks :D

You could at least try and hide the fact that your lying, you‚Äôve unlocked 5 trophy road brawlers,  1 super rare and at least 2 rares lol
---
i think you forgot about the most iq requiring strategy, el primo / bull walking up to dynamike and killing him because they got more hp than him

Thanks man for solace

Wait this post is serious? I mean you didn‚Äôt do anything impressive, even for a normal brawler, all you did was dodge a bull super, which is kind of easy for a quick boi.

Is not unplayable... You just need to be more careful and don't dive enemies carelessly. I got him to 500 trophies at lv 7 (I'm at 11.6k total trophies)

I don't like Colt as much as I like Rico, he is my favorite brawler, but Colt, that thing

Those tits tho

I thought this was photoshopped before I properly looked

The opposition had more HP, and they inflict 35% more damage as a collective. Stats don't lie

or add karma into brawl stars. would be a good improvement

Ur telling me that ur interested in some guy saving  a coupla boxes for Rosa when pretty much everyone is doing it too.

F for the Crow there ;(

I'm gonna try some too... If u don't mind

Hou cheater. You just Pulled rosa out of the screen and told everyone it was your OWN work. I see What you‚Äôre doing here

But this is indeed a fair matchmaking depends on the trophies

Brawl Stars has CHANGED me (which is not a good thing)

thats a lot work bro!! so this should be happening in 11.2/100 games? I admire your effort on this!! vote up!
---
‚ÄòYes, but actually, no‚Äô all the dynas

As one more spike, I approve  this
---
As one more spike,I approve of this

Im surprised she wasn't nerfed like not only that fucking thing zones out half of the map specially when is put behind a wall (I don't know if you understand what I mean) but also turns jessie into a 10000000 hp brawler and gives her 50000000 more dps, on top of that she is a sharpshooter and also heals the turret...
---
Lmao just tried it, can't believe that actually works.
---
It's end or no?

lol

Leon is great as well on this map. His speed allows him to quickly grab gems and his reach keeps the enemy pushed back where as if they pushed up, Leon‚Äôs close range attacks are so strong they‚Äôll die
---
I will never use rico ever again
---
Yeah I shold get good so that minecarts dont hit me? Bruh...I cant control that...im focused on the game and then just that dummy minecart comes in and kills me and maybe the netire team lol
---
Not the end
---
Yeah she maybe does need a small nerf but then she will became balanced in lower trophies but even more trash in higher trophies lol
---
What if its just a poop XD
---
I‚Äôve zero boxes, lol. üòû
---
I CANT NOT GET HIT BECAUSE IM FOCUSED ON THE GAME AND THEN IT JUST RANDOMLY HITS ME! It should be 1000 or 500 damage not 2000 like wtf that is too much

Gg

Leon is trying to be a tough guy but he can be a Total jerk, Scrappy is my puppy btw.

Ummm... let's say he was teaming with a Shelly so he was not a powercube at the moment
---
was playing dynamike in solo earlier and two dynas tried to spin on me. Killed them both :)
---
I love the idea though, I have seen a lot and I mean a lot of maps today which I absolutely hated because of TNT/useless jump panels/101 bushes/1-tile gaps, I actually like this map and I do think a map like this could be added.
---
Look buddy. Legendaries are not legendarie to be strong. I mean they are in some way but they are not exactly called legendaries because theyre strong. They are called legendarie because they have different and more mechanics in them than other brawler for example. Spike: mechanic 1:shoots a cactus that deals damage. Mechanic 2: that cactus explodes into a lot of small spikes. Mechanic 3: he has a super that deals damage. Mechanic 4: that super also slows down enemies. 4 mechanics he has. Thats why they are called legendaries. Same it goes through all rarityes. From common to legendary, every rarity has more and more abilities built into their brawlers.
---
When you have terrible randoms on your team, then you exit, wait 10 seconds and start another game, but still matched with the same 2 players (yes it happened to me)
---
Island Invasion needed to be removed though, Passage as well, a lot of teaming and way to much bushes. I kind of like Flying Fantasy tbh, it isn‚Äôt that bad, only use the jump panels at the start, or when you get cornered.
---
You can try it. It‚Äôs a but hard, but I‚Äôve done it multiple times. I‚Äôll record it and post it if I do accidentally get it again.
---
You know what? Ur blocked dude. I wont see amy more of your comments. Bye im blocking you.
---
I've just started playing. Why was Leon broken before and what nerfs has he received?
---
You are always awesome, but now, you just surprised me so much, it:'s literally a masterpiece, the same Like in the game
---
Wait for me to get 500 coins and then give you a Gold
---
Thats even the most op thing lol. She needs a nerf. And the biggest nerf she needs is to her turret. Once again you will not be able to push her to 500 in solos because she is not good in showdown. The only was you can so that is brawl ball, gem grab, siege. Sry mate but you gotta get a team...
---
ur dad lesbian
---
I think they look like gum balls, it isn‚Äôt a bad idea, but I think Rico skins should be a bit more different, I think all of the incoming Rico skins Will have a different attack animation, it is hard to see a difference between gum balls and bounty balls in-game, they can‚Äôr change the colours because the player has to know if the enemy is shooting or a friendly is shooting.
---
I wanted to say thisüòÇüòÖ
---
How did this happen?
---
OMFG HAHAHAHAH I'M DYING WTF
---
Darryl's super doesn't one shot anything
---
Leon to op only the no lucky player see if Leon kill is so hard and you Leon user you killed if using Leon just happen because you not skilled and you not pro
---
If your brawler (you are playing with) has over 400 trophies, you can watch it
---
Yes leon is now useless
---
Where do u see massive dps u can outrun it and deszroy it before it really does anything
---
Confirmed, New Troop : Minecraft.

Well skeletons are usually bald

If EA made it, that would cost a total of 100$
---
r/nooneasked
---
What would only happen to you?
---
Here we go again
---
Half the damage
---
But she didn't. Missed timing and opportunities are what determine victory and losses.
---
It's like saying you would've won if your Piper landed that one shot to the enemy in bounty, but if it didn't, then it's because you probably didn't aim right or predicted the enemy movement wrong.
---
Know that feeling bro
---
She receives 20% out of 100%
---
But then ppl started using tanks and the tanks were anti morti teaming with dynas and backstabbing them at the end
---
I was a gene?
---
A Colt that actually knows where to shoot? Wow!
---
I lost many trophies because a Colt had the supper but auto aim it :(
---
Brooken Frank
---
umm.. i only drew it with pencil so it isn't black enough
---
Hey how do you get the brawler icon in front of your name?
---
Yes who is it?
---
 You gotta spend Gems to make Gems!
---
When I play with bad randoms sometimes I cause the exact opposite
---
Rosa=OP-80% DAMAGE REDUCTION. THAT MEANS BULL'S SHOT, IF ALL BULLETS LAND, ONLY DOES 560 DAMAGE AT MAX LEVEL. WHAT'S MORE ROSA ONLY TAKES  3 AND A THIRD FULL SHOTS TO BECOME UNSTOPPABLE AND IF THAT'S NOT ENOUGH THE BUSH HEALS HER 300 PER SECOND AND IF THE BRAWLER WHO DOES THE MOST DAMAGE IN ONE SHOT, DARRYL, ONLY DOES 627.2, THEN IN THE BUSH WITH SUPER SHE'S OP AS HELL. supercell nerf her super and/or star power. maybe health. but dont nerf damage. it wont help
---
But you got it out of a mega box. I have a mega box saved up for Rosa.
---
im sorry for u fellow colt

That is no bug
---
What the fuck have you brought upon this cursed land
---
Debatable
---
i think there's an algorithm or something which uses your club's members to rig the boxes for example if you have much more trophies they'll most likely have more brawlers that way its forcing you to buy things to increase your "luck value". i mean it might sound stupid but im at 3.1k and ive got a friend who was in a club or something and like 2 days after i joined the club he got his second legendary and gene with 1.9k trophies
---
And another shitty post about this... stop, kid
---
That‚Äôs insane
---
The new meme: a Frankenstein, a bull, a wrestler and a man with dynamit are going in the zoo.
---
Almost every brawler I have, had a lot of tilt
---
It is usefulüòÑ
---
huh. i thought mine guy unlocks at 3k
---
Also, doesn't the percentage for a legendary drop depending on the rarity of the Brawler found? It shouldn't drop a lot anyway even if you wait for Rosa to come out, since she's only Rare
---

You gave them what they deserved

Pretty much everyone is maxed out at 10000 trophies...
---
I can make Shelly with Dyna animation
---
Doesn‚Äôt make sense haha
---
I wonder how many legendaries will be added to the game before Supercell makes it easier to actually obtain one.
---
Remember Clash Royale? Legendaries used to be really rare to come by. Then they made them gradually easier to get with time.
---
Today's lesson: *Never spam auto aim when the ball is near of you*
---
How is that even possible?
---
Fine
---
This would be pretty cool though? Not sure why people wouldn't want this. Obviously if the price as a whole went up that wouldn't be cool. But more customization is generally a good thing.  
---
One case where this would have been great is night witch Mortis. How many people would have jumped to buy the axe from that skin for 20 gems or something.
---
no but i think he met my mem
---
Mate you lucky boy I‚Äôm only at 3100 trophies but my rarest brawlers are Rico and Penny and my legendary chance is 0.1104
---
How many gems do you think it will cost ?
---
The bunny Penny skin do not have a losing animation.
---
The new Slender Leon skin looks great
---
im at 4k and have all rare, super rare + pam and thats it :(
---
You're not wrong, Shelly and Mortis do have similar hair color.

Me: Piper u ok?
---
Piper: * thumb up
---
There were these exploits in those two maps where players could kick the ball into the water, then they would take forever to get out. The thing about the ball was that in water it would move *extremely slow*, so by kicking the ball in you could essentially buy yourself a lot more time to deal with the enemy team, sometimes up to 20 seconds. But, well, it was unfair to those who lost because of the exploit, so it had to be changed. Both maps were removed, I think.
---
So yeah, good map concept, but nobody likes to see too much water in Brawl Ball.

Vas it diffikult too play wiht to so many pipers?

I've made it too, it's so satisfying

Considering there's only 2 players globally with brawlers over 1k trophies, I'm interested to know how this was achieved...

Their should be a new cat and skeleton brawlers with bulls face and crow on the back of their jackets to match bull and crow
---
I saw a post on this sub which was artwork of Crow and some other cat dude, his "rival". Forgot who made that but I made stats for it; this would be cool!
---
The thing with trophies is that you can lose them. XP cannot be lost and that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs more accurate.
---
Poco = a Skeleton
---
Serenade poco = poco with other clothes
---
Serenade poco has a mustache
---
HOW DOES A SKELETON HAVE A MUSTACHE?!?!

That‚Äôs not bad

You mean nice peace of sugar?
---
The reason why this was added is because once you go into queue with a specific brawler, you're meant to stay with the brawler. If you're playing with randoms and then change the selection you are basically rigging the matchmaking, you're better off going with a team. Where you're actually able to select brawlers and what it was meant for. And if this was a thing in random queue it would make teams nearly useless.

Best animation with fun edits. I wish i could p2upvote someday
---
0. Because I will buy her wih gems üòà Im F2P and got 84 gems
---
well yea because 1 good game doesn't mean you'll win 5 games in a row
---
How the fucc did you get crow at 3000? I had to spend 50$ to get 1 legendary at like 5000 trophies.
---
r/cursedimages
---
Masz problem to sio!!!
---
I like the idea; we need a drawing
---
It has one of the best animations (The face, You'll get used it)
---
Yeah but the chance of not pulling a star power out of hundreds of boxes is still pretty low.
---
Yes
---
I've read that Rosa will be available for only 30 gems (or is it 50, I don't remember) so it's somewhat accesible.
---
Ah my bad
---
Your levels put together is 666
---
Weird flex but ok. üò∞üò∞üò∞
---
You should get at least 1 more brawler in the next 100 chests, i opened my mega at 4 k, no bonuses, a day later i got frank
---
That's true, but it still drops even if only by a little..
---
oof
---
I tried
---
The quality of mine is trash compared to yours :'..(
---
The whole point of the ‚Äúplay again‚Äù button is to use the same exact team.
---
A ‚Äújoin group‚Äù button would be more beneficial.

Leon is shy af as me
---
Comment √ßa va?
---
Damn that's lucky, I'm level 100 and have no legendaries and mythics.
---
Nerf and nerf... and Leon is still S-rank...
---
Go to nita in third skins and see the date
---
Dunno, it just seems unfair to have max time due to an exploit that has been patched.
---
üëç
---
I love Nita a ton, she's super cute but a little on the weaker side. I haven't gotten much good use of her out of any game mode... so some ideas were:
---
NITA:
---
More damage? One clip from anyone can kill her, she can't do that in return to anyone but Rico I believe. But I'm not sure this is the solution.
---
She's not really a tank but her range is so low she kinda should be. Having more HP or better sustain would help.
---
If she ran faster it'd be thematic, and make sense for her abilities. 
---
BEAR:
---
It takes a lot of hits to get the bear out, maybe lower this amount?
---
Bear is countered by Penny and Jessie hard, because it pierces and wrecks Nita. Perhaps he could stop projectiles from passing him but still take damage? This could also affect Primo punches, and Shelly's super? It'd be a great support tool for teams.
---
I'd love if he was faster, even if it was a rage system like when Nita takes damage he gets faster or something. Make him more viable and more of a threat.
---
Now I don't want ALL of these buffs, these are just ideas! Let me know what you think!

Low effort repost

when you are playing with bots you aren't going to have lag because there's only one player, when you play with people the matchmaking tries to find the players closest to you so you do not have lag but it will not always be like that
---
Flair checks out
---
How so
---
Mista is displeased with you

Better yet, G O L D D O U B L E R S

This is GediKor's skin idea, stop stealing artwork.

Yeah I‚Äôm sure you would like that

understandable, have a nice day
---
Wtf this us stolen from u/GEDI-KOR
---
Who goes with frank here....
---
is this a joke
---
Sea man mortis
---
1% chance to get star power = 99% chance to not get star power.
---
0.99\^241 is chance to not get star power from opening 241 boxes.
---
1-(0.99\^241) is chance to get a star power from opening 241 boxes.
---
1-(0.99\^241)=0.911
---
This means there's about a 91.1% chance you would get the star power from opening 241 boxes (8.9% chance to not get the star power). A very high number, but still not guaranteed. Unfortunate, but possible. Just unlucky.
---
I mean if it can happen in ransoms then you should be able to do it with a team
---
Not mediocre.... Much better üòÅ
---
why is it always this skin
---
Just die, please

Oh I hadn‚Äôt seen the map before starting so I just went frank lol

There's no guaranteed number like that. That's not how probability works

He is a troll and I know what he‚Äôs doing. This subreddit is constantly inflated by shitposts of meme formats that have been beaten to death. He unironically is one of the only good posters and indirectly acknowledges that this sub is full of children. Look at his posts; nobody is calling him out as a troll, since the sub actually unironically believes that he‚Äôs doing this unironically. He is one of the best posters on here for months and his content actually made me laugh since it proves how delusional redditors are. Stop falling for this shit and stop using this site.
---
You know how it works

Thx bro

what if: no
---
SHUT UP! BRING BACK THIS MAPS! THEY ARE MY FAVOURITE!
---
Someone may play 5 hours a day and someone else just get the tokens at the end they will have open the same boxes  but the first will be higher lv due to play time so level its irrelevant
---
I can't tell if this is a joke or not
---
You're right we have enough El primo like brawlers by now
---
This is some serious gourmet shit
---
I can't imagine! I have made an idea for club wars too! And I didn't expect that we will have lots of similarities in our ideas! (I swear I didn't see your post about club wars. It is when I have uploaded 4+ posts about club wars. Also, I did not steal your idea if you have any doubt)

the map is pretty cool but teamers would get a boner from this

I don't think so this is An example of how people become after they main Shelly and other shotgunners
---
Yeah, but you have all the other brawlers. That's pretty lucky in my eyes.
---
I don‚Äôt have an exact number because the amount of power points vary from box to box but I would say between 100-200 boxes

I think dynamike Brock and mortis were better before but the rest are better now

Theres a subreddit for this kind of thing r/deepfriedmemes but i think he used some kind of filter idk how he made the range longer

It's fine but this map look like its for teaming because of the Walls

Mhmm... u posted this 52 mins ago ,Gedi kor posted a week ago. He definately stole this from you

I agree I dislike siege because of lost of trophies and brawl ball is my favorite game mode it should be like showdown and just switch maps

Darryl was one of the strongest brawlers a few metas ago because he was buffed with dmg and star power. He was overpowered. Now, he is worse due to a star power nerf but still good. Only good with star power, arguably one of the worst w/o it. Possible to get to rank 20 without star though

nobody said that barley needs a nerf, and NO Dynamike still the best thrower  he literally has more damage than barley, nobody of both needs a nerf or buff they are neutral, and I don't care if you report me reedit isn't my life its a hobby

---
Damage isn't everything. It's relatively easy to dodge his shots, especially if you're on top of him. Dynamike also has very little control compared to Barley, and as a thrower, it is as important to have control, if not more than damage. Also, Dyna's star power is very situational, while Barley's is relaible and keeps him in the fight longer.
---
I don‚Äôt think this is a good idea because the mine arrangement is rng based, and you can see the radius of where the mines will be placed so how can they miss your target lol
