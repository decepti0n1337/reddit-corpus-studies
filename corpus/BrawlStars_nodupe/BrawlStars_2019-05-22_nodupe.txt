Yes, Thank you for posting this, I really get annoyed when people kept repeating posts that hundreds of other players have already posted.

When your parents are rich but you suck at the game.

1. It was in the patch notes
---

---
2. A lot of YouTubers covered it
---
3. Wrong flair?
---
Scratch is just block programming. Not much skill needed
---
Debatable
---
Homerun should make the brawlers spin when they get hit by it
---
Its part of the update
---
damn,that camel toe
---
Pam's projectiles shoot in a side-to-side pattern but the projectiles themselves travel straight in one direction
---
Don't you dare!
---
I mean....
---
Rather be a smart ass than a dumb ass. Like you. Who‚Äôs not maxed. But thinks he is.
---
All my brawlers are rank 20. 12.5k total. I don‚Äôt play solo or duos anymore. Not worth the aggravation.
---
Why, why, why? ^is ^this ^skin ^so ^good
---
that bottom left picture will happen regardless of how strong the champ is.
---
Well looks the like bat is trying to team. #StopTheSpin
---
New for global players. It‚Äôs well over a year old.
---
Yes
---
Would you mind also sending me the code
---
No. 3 legendaries is already extremely grindy. Maybe 1 more mythic but 3 legendaries is where it needs to stay for a LONG time.
---
Because people liked the meme, but doesn't have anything to comment
---
this is bullshit
---
Except it actually does a lot of damage
---
Bro not is not enough you cant even unlock a RARE brawler we need atleast 150 brawl boxes what is up with you guyz are you a nooob
---
Once you know its weakness, its easy to be good using Frank.
---
But yes, its just my opinion, Frank was my Second Brawler Rank 20. The First was Piper.
---
And I know your point, there are no "best Brawler", only good players with them.
---
Frank! Also penny was released on the same day
---
Where are the new map objects???
---
How is this funny? ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Or your comment &gt; yourname &gt; chnage user flair

I‚Äôve been going through this sub since Jan 2018 and less than 25% of the posts were memes. Memes were exploding since global

can you not read?
---
Lol this post appear every new brawler update... Last time i did this got rosa, I got almost 2k upvotes xD
---
It has to be brawl stars related content.
---
sorry man i cant type braille for you
---
O.o
---
thanks supercell
---
Just use github and share the repo.
---
Faxxx, what‚Äôs up there?
---
Yeah for example, I suck with Frank
---
Wow I been using reddit for 2 yrs and always wondered also, thank u man. Just got crow two days ago too #crowgang
---
Will you be the next gedi but with 3D models?
---
This is another version of I had to do it to em

This is false. Brick would 100% serve Carl. r/brockkgang

So truuuuu
---
Can you send me the code for this or upload it on github or something please
---
No. Pipi is the name
---
Wait what?
---
Now that‚Äôs impressive!!
---
Mines on the 19th sad day  lol
---
Same lol
---
Not OP in the least. I love using that super to dash and smash and the enemies have no counterplay, it's just too fast. Even faster than old barley shotgun super
---
Rosa is my name Fing is my game
---
Ok that fits too well
---
No absolutely... I‚Äôll say once and I‚Äôll explain it a million ‚Äòtimes.
---
1. Piper... her name is piper. So Pipe Her.
---
2.If you think about it, most of her quotes are flirtatious..
---
3.But wait there‚Äôs more ‚Äústick a fork in me I‚Äôm done?‚Äù Has anyone heard that quote from her? I believe they took it down in a recent patch (or may still be there). 
---
4. Her ability damage.. the farther the bullet the higher the damage! Same affect is given to a woman when she‚Äôs taking D!
---
3. Why does her weapon look like a straight dildo??? I mean come on. Plus it‚Äôs  awfully huge üòÇ
---
4. And last but not least Piper wears a pink dress, that in which maybe expresses either a princess or some 1800‚Äôs western prostitute.
---
What's with this lore... This game doesn't really have lore right? Wasn't it all Fan made?
---
The crow age is very accurate cuz if you add the average crow lifespan (7.5 yrs) and the average male human lifespan (71.5 yrs) and divide by two you get 39.5. So 39.5 is the average between the two life expectancies.

your not alone ~~

Humorous skin is a genre now i guess

You can‚Äôt turn off losing trophies. If you want to play without losing trophies then do a privat match

All we ever did in the boys locker room is scream loud and get in trouble but when they asked who did it so one said it. We did this the hole year with out being fought once

Why does he have a camel toe
---
Tomorrow, it is the same chance plus you also might get Bibi
---
Rice bullets? You mean the coins?
---
If you keep your distance, you cant hit them
---
It's just... they hyped up this update so much! The cryptic messages to Brazilian YouTubers, the Retropolis animation, 26/25 videos on their YouTube channel. They hyped the fuck out of this update. I was expecting a lot more than a normal update, but that's all it is. A normal update. Don't get me wrong,the update is great! I love the new maps, the Retropolis theme is great, and this might be the best batch of skins in Brawl Stars history. Plus, Bibi! But with all of the hype surrounding the update, it was a letdown. I was anticipating so much more.
---
Yo supercell don‚Äôt do this shit
---
almost 2 years
---
Tomorrow.
---
GEM GRAB CITY MAP
---
Hey I know you!
---
Best skin ever
---
Oof

That front knuckle... gawd dayum!

goddammit i already have mortis

Dude same! Happy b day fellow may 21stian!!!!

You have been banned from r/CarlGang

Funny thing is, I did the same thing with El PrimoüòÇüòÇ
---
\*Botany
---
But modifiers are only in showdown
---
How did this even get 2k upvote
---
I don't get why so many people dislike this skin, it looks really good! And, remember, Barley's a robot. Robots don't have sexes.
---
yes
---
Mine is Brock saying take the L. They are coping fortnite
---
Poco definitely older than 13
---
ohh perfect, thanks!
---
After global, there wasn't any big update, it's why people are dissapointed
---
:D
---
Nope
---
This is what happens when you BUFF a top 3 brawler already. Thanks SUPERCELL...
---
hes 14
---
I wouldn‚Äôt. Pam is still very strong and Leon is still solid. Pam just went from best in the game to top 3 and Leon is just balanced now.
---
[removed]
---
The Voice is actually nice and fitting, much better than the last VO, like Carls extremely Annoying Voice, or Gene just saying Bullshit!
---
Isn‚Äôt that the point of Carl‚Äôs unique attack though?
---
Still bo is the most childish skin in whole game
---
Penny is better in walled maps, Jessie in open maps
---
look at my post... you will know what i‚Äôm talking about lmao
---
Too freaking OP if you ask me. Good thing they nerfed his super otherwise the game would've been barley stars
---
It's actually called Mr. Bat
---
"BurgerBra"
---
FRANK GANG anyone?
---
Anything that comes out of Carl's mouth.
---
Tara doesn't need a buff at all, skins are just a way to make the game more fun. Also, wasn't everyone always asking for character voiceovers? I agree with you on this point, teaming should have a solution by now.   
---
It's stupid to base match making on power level since anyone can just buy tons of boxes and max a brawler out, that doesn't mean you're a better player. Trophies are what determines your skill.
---
They won‚Äôt stop us from playing Brawl Stars!
---
Umm, okay, guess rubber ducky Jessie and Bunny Penny don't exist
---
A sweet granny that knocks your teeth out?
---
YES
---
I see you in so many posts
---
Not thicc enough
---
Nighty night!
---
Yes he was
---
i think theres a brawlstars r34 subreddit called r/brawlstarsp exists go surf that
---
that‚Äôs quite the discount
---
That concludes my point.
---
Now bakesale and maple Barley kills people by giving them Diabetes.
---
How to improve? Listen to testers' feedback! Literally every tester said Rosa was OP but SS released her as is.
---
Well that's a solid 5%!
---
ikr
---
Too fetishy
---
That is the old icon of the coins. Supercell changed them in the update for the Global Release (around December 12th 2019) and probably forgot/missed to change this one and it looks like that's a different currency but it's still the same coins.
---
same here
---
We GoT BrAwL Tv
---
5 new brawlers and an entire new game mode isn't too bad... Throw in several new maps, skins, and other little changes and I think they've done a decent amount in 6 months.
---
I like the idea
---
Maybe season reset took off some trophies? I dunno.
---
You said gene was extremely underpowered, balanced and above average in the same sentence üòÇ which is it? And also pretty sure his normal attack hasn't changed whatsoever. Search up how much supercell is worth, all their games are "free" too. And also Leon was the first one, his super didn't get changed for weeks. Bibi is super weak her attack speed is way too slow, guaranteed she's getting buffed in 3 days or less.
---
Clash Royale got like 20 new cards in 6 months, several game mode challenges, new arenas, things that actually changed how the game is played. Gameplay. Skins and new map environments don't change gameplay. But yes I also forgot about the community maps and such
---
This is nightmare fuel. I love it :v
---
Yeah but he is still good.
---
I swear if you whoosh me...
---
Your joke
---
Their head
---
Woosh
---
I couldn't find any imgame pics od the tier 10, also they recently added the obj 279 from pc. you made a good call quiting
---
A jojoke and a gene skin, that's what I call quality
---
Bush-spin ?
---
wrong stars
---
OPM, read the manga dude, s2 has been dissapointing ao far üòû
---
Opened 97 boxes and 8 big boxes yesterday. Only got Nita star power
---
Why aren't the other channels getting removed that do exactly that and have millions of views
---
Wc! ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Wow good job!! Also I think long skirt is better
---
Amazing style and piece of art. 8 out of 8 m8 this is g8
---
Hmmm then his content is problem, doing that poses is illegal? I asked that question a hour ago still no reply (but he will reply)
---
Everything is relative, barley with 7 lvl on 260 trophies is really bad, not saying Im pro, but by playing only 3v3 I brought him to 420 with his 7 lvl. Gene‚Äôs trophies are also quite low.
---
I asked that question Dani_Supercell*
---
Endgame guy oml
---
Sounds a lot like another post from yesterday, where some guy got banned for clear signs of account sharing but it was wrongly labeled as phishing.
---
The so called defender not the is-3 right?
---
I stand corrected.
---
Duo showdown is an option :v sometimes....depends if your team mate doesnt have mental issues
---
F?
---
Welp that person seems dead to me
---
Showdown needs the new bulls diner theme
---
Nerf me sideways XD
---
Scratch that worst star power ever is definitely Penny's. El primo's is bad but at least it stops people from healing for an extra 4 seconds after retreating, but Penny's seldom rarely goes off in the first place, and then when it does it rarely ever hits anybody, so yeah practically useless.
---
Sorry its been a month :P Busy doing da finals
---
it was more of a  bug fix but yeah gene and carl needed nerf.
---
Having the same sometimes not always close the app and try again
---
In 15 years Colt, your guns won't save your sister from a Fate Worse Than S*x
---
lmao, that must've been scary
---
No, hiding in a bush in Bull's Bar like the camper he is.
---
I don't think that entertaining people is a problem,they probably have a good reason
---
Why are you opening boxes before her release?! Sorry man no sympathy lol. But hey, Leon, right?
---
I am a global player but don‚Äôt whine. It‚Äôs just that I am, and probably a lot of other readers of this sub are, tired of posts complaining and whining that they are either not getting legendaries or any brawler in general. It‚Äôs called probabilities people not guaranteed chances.
---
Cheer up bro. I had no legendary or mythic at 6k, then all of my luck just decided to come forth at once so I got two legendary in a week.
---
Omg what is wrong with u
---
Nah people just couldn‚Äôt get on brawl stars.
---
I got spike tdy. The hype is real boys. My first legend at 6k
---
Penny asserts dominance over Leon once again
---
It appears as though they only match make by brawler rank.  This is stupidly flawed as I get teammates that are 2,000 trophies and I'm at 8,500.  That's a big skill/experience difference, especially when you are trying to use brawlers that your weak with to rank them up.  Yes trophy road is also terrible rewards.
---
This JUST in, a guy named Just didn't like his club.
---
Nice. I got spike tdy while hunting for bibi
---
Supercell NEED MONEY
---
Your point? I know that I‚Äôm not blind
---
Basically the shop gave an offer to buy Bibi for 170 gems. But the thing is as i had brawl boxes saved up to have chance to get Bibi, I got her in the second brawl box and the offer in the shop changed to this one instead
---
Jan=feb
---
That's it i'm bringing me wallet
---
Yes, you will go to hell &amp; you'll be bff with satan.
---
Oh do you think the price of epic in gems will be reduced?
---
nope u can stack ult if u hit enough target
---
Brazil
---
Thats normal
---
he is both online and not online until you open the box
---
nice idea
---
Wow thanks for sharing
---
At least someone else gets it too. Man I‚Äôm so frustrated at this. Imagine being matched with players 1/5th your trophies. 
---
The things they do just wants me to give up mid game
---
ye
---
He is alive
---
If you get ambushed you can push them away so it's a pro
---
Was it after the maintenance break ? Cause they had problems with the servers. Might be that fixing this issue has created some crashes somehow ? Like when Gene using a super made everyone crash the game when he was released
---
nice detail!
---
If pam's the mother, then who's the dad?
---
Nobody cares
---
P.S : nothing against these newer players or low trophy players. I was at that point once too. Everyone starts a game as a noob only but why matchmake me with them. It‚Äôs not fair to them. It‚Äôs not fair to me.
---
lol it happens i had 15 brawlers at 3000 trophies but now at 3100 i have 18 i have tara and frank as my highest
---
r/crowgang
---
Nope. This whole ‚Äúupdate‚Äù was to sell her
---
Enemy team : Nani?!
---
This counts for all supercell games.
---
Basically a russian teen youtuber proposed adding that tag in your name for easier teaming. It's sad and hilarious and the same time once you realize that you can't even see the names beyond 300 cups.
---
congrats for getting leon
---
Yeah those type of post annoy me. Its like people forget rng is a think and expect that they get a legendary after a 2 months of playing
---
Ack, you could have finished her off as soon as the super activates. I play enough Mortis to have the balls to face a Shelly 1v1 if I'm close to my super.
---
and it all started from that robot.. that damned robot..
---
Thanks
---
I was cringing the whole time I was scrolling in that sub. Idk, too much Jessie and *inhales* WHY SPIKE?
---
I hope so atleast but they are not ridiculously high though
---
Just thinking of Zelda things that would work for it
---
r/Darrylgang aproves
---
Honestly I would believe Bibi is the big sister and was the first child and bull named her
---
He must be yellow
---
I found it hard to make them older since they all look quite young, so I tried to cheat a bit with tara
---

Yes this is a great deal it is worth it and you are forced to buy it I am so epic that I am a myth

maybe precision error

Literally the oldest brawler called new one wow that sucks

&gt; Had a look at your account the account was banned for clear signs of account sharing, not phishing. The reason was incorrectly chosen (which I will fix), but the ban remains.

Breaching our ToS just won‚Äôt be tolerated. Sorry, but I can‚Äôt help you out of this one.

I will find where you live and kill you lol

What did he do that was so bad you have to reddit shame.

Oh no hes gona team with a dyna

What a free karma .. hehehe
---
Yyyyyyeeeesssss
---
In what way?
---
Well. First of all he left me die. Second before I could respawn, he let a primo kill him.
---
I blocked him
---
No you won‚Äôt
---
She is a girl
---
Not again Not again!!!!!

Lol. I dont think so.

He blocked me either way.

Hm. Although he was a bad player, that‚Äôs still not a good reason to publicly shame him. I have wanted to do this sometimes, but I never do because, what really gets accomplished by doing this?
---
Nita is a girl.
---
No useless but strugles alot
---
Cmon supercell there's other map creators out there
---
Characters in that tier often get uncomfortably close for a long time
---
Well i could have unlocked piper or frank but I Got pam that is my fav epic
---
The draw remind me garfield.
---
Just u
---
Yeah Pam is better
---
OMG There‚Äôs a new brawler!! His name‚Äôs Leon and he goes invisible OMG!!!!
---
He's not shit you just need brain cells to play him
---
When you dont have Bibi ;-;
---
you're right I'm an idiot
---
Is this... a leon nerf?! I dont know what you are saying but i hope not! He isnt really that good atm.
---
Who tf even mains a brawler?!
---
14 boxes and my first epic
---
Im looking it from many different Views, dont get me wrong, i just like Leon mostü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è but even if you are a Tank, if a Shelly gets you with Superstacking, you wont Survive, just like with Rosa when she has her Shield while attacking you, and it is a fact that Tanks have a high movement, only beaten by Leon and Crow ( and Mortis with dash), and it's unfair, even as Leon trying to outrun, try Playing Piper in Showdown üòÇ, might aswell join the Spinning if you want to win ( exept for those two Maps which the Names i dont remember ), and you are often forced in Situations where Shotgunners and Tanks are in complete advantage, Many Maps in Modes have pionts where they are so in advantage, only thing that happens in Such Situations is Barley or Dyna get the Upper hand! The only Reason i liked Island invasion, was because of the Big open Center, where short Range Brawlers and even more throwers are in a disadvantage, the Problem is, there are to many advantages for Low Range/Skill on almost every Map in any Gamemode, thats why Crow needed a Buff, he has one of the Lowest HP, and Damage, making him an easy target, spike is good at getting kills or keeping people away, but if theres a Suprise, He's gone i  a Blink, Leon has been Nerfed to much, the first 2 were needed, but after that it was not needed, Tara with Super is nice, but getting it is a Pain, Mortis is fun to play and also high(est) Skill, nice againts Teaming Dynas, but the fun ends with tanks and Shotgunners, since he cant outdamage/tank them :/ Piper has her Low Range Problem, and there is Brock much better, and I could go on forever explaining the Problem!
---
But to Sum it up, i think Tanks and Shotgunners are bad because they only Support boring Low skill Playstiles,  and they mostly use Suprise and then Simply outdamge/tank you and if there is a high Range Brawler they can dodge or just Run away!
---
His name is Mr Bat
---
Ikr. STUPID!!!!
---
I had made a post earlier and heard what a lot of them had to say. Considering all I made this post. 
---
He‚Äôs def not balanced according to me at least hence this post. I just feel these changes put him in the same meta as crow and spike
---
5 reposts?
---
(Rule 34 intensifies)
---
It was for Carl
---
And no fucks apperently
---
Wow a dynamike teaming? Who would‚Äôve guessed
---
I dont have an issue with him at all.
---
imo mortis should have the same vision range as bo with a star power. maybe smaller.
---
Your image should just be of slowpoke.
---
Nice
---
yup. relatable. lots of pipers do this. personally i do it cause it looks cool... idk
---
Not funny

Good luck.

I love this pun!

"This puts a smile on my face!"

I agree. Kids have ruined this sub for sure. I don't get how their parents are letting them on reddit anyways. Lol

it really was better back in beta because only cultured people knew about the game but little kids arent leaving so we must embrace them. Also sex jokes are so LOLOLOLOLXDXDüëåüëåü§£ü§£üòÇüòÇ
---
Nah i can acces my account anytime but why would i really.
---
You're supposed to check bushes though. If you don't do the obvious counter that LITERALLY EVERY BRAWLER EXCEPT FOR MORTIS can do then don't complain

Ok...

then I know how teammate BULL lose

Just eat the chilli before Pam does.

Once playing gem grab enemy got 10 gems and countdown started we had 8 gems by the last second we got the 10  gems
---
Enemy piper probably didn't realize that and jump to the middle we made total 20 gems and win
---
I always do that

Bandit even has like two mini baseball bats in her hand aswellüòÇ
---
Bull have a diner, El Primo a restaurant
---
star shelly looks better with new background
---
I can almost relate to this.
---
Been saving up to yesterday 19 small boxes and a big box. Today I accidentally opened one box 2 hours before Bibi got released and I got Piper. Even if I got another 2 small boxes plus another big box it was no use. I asked God for a batter, he gave me a sniper.
---
They should give us again the chance of buying them individually like in the beta
---
Tylko POLSKA
---
Black friday in Poland be like:
---
Yea lol
---
Ah oneof thos ppl
---
I dont think so
---
Hi
---
Recently, every time WHEN I PLAY WITH MY TWO FRIENDS, I WILL GET RED WIFI SIGNAL FREQUENTLY and I can't control my brawler any more, IT ONLY HAPPENS WHEN I TEAM WITH MY FRIENDS, any ideas?
---
I'm in Taiwan, using note 8, we always play around 10\~12pm, UTC+8,
---
My account code is:#8P9YQUJ98
---
Yes currently at lvl 7
---
Can you give bibi for 80 diamonds
---
It doesn't have an impact on your droprate for dood brawlers
---
‚ÄúRosa is mah nyame bo-an-y is meh gayme‚Äù Carl does it much better, and Carl‚Äôs line isn‚Äôt even that good.
---
Opened 120 boxes and no bibi. Now im forced to buy her FeelsBadMan
---
I got in my 5th.
---
at least you can buy leon
---
Got her from my 6k mega box
---
That's my screenshot.
---
thats not epic, thats mythical
---
You're name is op
---
Tara remodel IS coming
---
Damn
---
Check the twitter
---
no fuckin way lmao
---
Nope :/
---
;)
---
Tottaly real
---
Mortis is my name, killing dynamike is my ga e
---
He was kinda toxic so I did hard work to remove the toxicity. Plus my cousin saw them teaming!
---
I didnt realise that someone has already posted this.
---
r/ihadastroke
---
1. Obviously, not that it matters. It's not like the pads stop any attack, and we know his weapon Comes back regardless where he is or what's between them.
---
2. Hard to believe with with the need to explain the "2 things", like we can't read all the bot names. Or the need to show off a launch pad attack that's been around since Carl was released. 
---
But hey, thanks for the much needed break of Bibi spam to bring back some of the old spam. 
---
Keep, keeping it stale my man.
---
Thanks dude! :D glad you like them!
---
Every single brawler can team, that doesn‚Äôt mean you had to kill him, Crow is the cutest brawler in the game, his voice is so cute.
---
Congratulations :]
---
Spaghetti code
---
Maybe its for people who have 2 or more epic brawlers missing
---
This is amazing
---
Bibi is trash, no need to counter
---
Other than the spelling errors, and the ink bomb kinda reminding me of barley's, it's good. Also that star power is a very interesting thing.
---
Your Epic Chances doesn't change at all (only legendary chance resets)
---
could you explain the joke?
---
Kind of... I wanted to get bibi but instead I got piper, which is the same rarity
---
For the HYPE
---
Jesus that sub is actually way worse than what I was expecting... who tf is making these?? Who‚Äôs paying them and why
---
Ok lol I don‚Äôt know why I keep saying that
---
Or just Rosalina, mystery theme.
---
when do they release? Bibi is out but the skins aren't
---
Come on you guys are adding new brawlers every update and you‚Äôre not even making it easier to unlock them in the first place,it‚Äôs so hard to get new brawlers,I‚Äôm at 5200 and missing bibi all mythics and legendaries like come on this is so unfair the luck system in the game is so bad cuz it‚Äôs 100% RNG please take notes from clash royale and change this unlock system and make us free to play players live easier
---
Mega knkght theme suits more to primo than rosa, because of his jump mechanic
---
Amazing art!
---
Yes they can still camp but it will take a minute to kill them.
---
Whats the name of the song?
---
Im playing on mobile so for me its terra blade for now
---
Da, dc crezi cƒÉ vorbesc rom√¢nƒÉ?
---
Hey for once the new brawler deal and "new epic brawler" deals actually align.
---
Yes please
---
Is it running at 60 fps? Mine game doesn't work so smooth like ur gameplay...
---
Boxes cost gems.
---
Salam cu mamaliga
---
Very sad (I got pam instead of rosa meaning I couldn't push her upp before the first nerf that is sad bibi is not getting a nerf soon)
---
She's strong in showdown. I wouldn't say broken at all though.
---
Yoh got a chance to buy the bringer of doom,after you got that bubblegum batt kid.You had a chance to buy the master...
---
You sure this aint Lex footage?
---
That‚Äôs what happened to me when gene came out
---
Good post quality sir.
---
Yep, Ryan has been evolved into Leob
---
Did you make this steal to get attention?
---
Hey, that's my next stop on the road too!
---
Trophy road rewards at high ranks are a joke, It's really sad.
---
On the other hand, those 25 PP just got my Crow to level 9 after weeks of waiting (the RNG gods have not been in my favor), so there's that.
---
r/lootstars
---
r/thirdsub
---
But... it's here... ü§î
---
And if its a joke dont w0000sh me please
---
How is the price looking rn?
---
No Leon is Epic now. /s
---
There are a lot of skins on crow STOP IT
---
I don‚Äôt know
---
Baaaa esti roman
---
El primo is my name,jumping into the enemy base with 10 gems is my game
---
Keep clicking that link it doesn't cost you anything to supporr him but he does get like some procent value of you spending gems or money .
---
I hate that there is no discount for bibi, that's dumb.
---
Better than nothing! üòÄ
---
nice skin! i would get it.
---
Lmfao you steal someone's art and dont even take time to hide it. Pathetic
---
keep commenting and shitt ü§ô I get a lotta down votes but its aight
---
Idk but he's kinda stupid
---
DMed.
---
Shut the hell up you spoiled dick
---
**it**
---
Yeet
---
I have all of them except Bibi and it appeared
---
Wow nice job, bet you did it in 4 hours.. Looking forward to brawlers who don't have skins yet!
---
Lol true
---
This is the kind of stuff that deserves to be on the top of this sub. Let's get this person there if we can.
---
That is better
---
Got gene like this but not bibi
---
40 trophies is not absolutely a lot:))) from 450 i have her 330:(
---
You DON'T want to know what I put in that pot!
---
Yeah but she will be good in Brawl Ball
---
Grab your pitchforks!
---
Crow is pretty edgy too ya know.
---
Gg xd with piper he‚Äôs the only brawler i miss
---
A long time ago you could get any brawler out of a box, then they added the trophy road and stuff like this happened
---
2k? maybe 2,5k?
---
AND WE WANT YOU TO STOP BULLYING THE CREATORS OF THE GAME THERE DOING FINE.  If you don't like it just go play fortnite with other 9 years old we have no problem with that and they totaly won't miss voice lines for people because they don't even have that.
---
I bought Bibi today. Someone needs to put food on the devs tables and subsidize the F2P community!
---
Yeah I guess that guy never played again, I know, I‚Äôm playing since beta
---
Thx, I'm wrong, my chance is 0.02880
---
To be honest the first ones aren‚Äôt too great either.
---
Is that the coc wizard robe?
---
Hell yeah, give me Leon
---
Ok buddy, stop spreading false information. Your chances from getting a brawler from a box are clearly stated if you hit the little "i" icon when inspecting a box in the shop. Downvoted.
---
‚Äúhis‚Äù
---
Gene is my name, AWUDAHBHAHUWADUBHA!
---
I think they're joking but at the same time they're not exactly particularly good jokes.
---
That's nice! He looks sad though.
---
That was Leon's line ! üòÅ
---
I mean it's close to my birthday so there're possibilities.
---
Same
---
If you have a brawler with little to no trophies with lvl 8, your enemy will most likely be lvl 1 with it. Win.
---
Up next: A leon skin without his hood cause this guy keels stealing it
---
I don't understand?
---
fat stack of money
---
*Was this review helpful?*
---
....yes.. yes it was.
---
I like this
---
are the ones on the top panel are supposed to be better? yikes
---
i feel like his super should be glue cuz it slows down ppl but idk
---
You paid... So obvious
---
yeah that one or the global update. or even the landscape update
---
True but I feel then it‚Äôs too easy, which was why i didn‚Äôt play Rosa when she was initially released. I just enjoy the challenge
---
SHIT Got too real
---
I feel he needs a reload speed buff
---
You have a serious problem over there. We should start a petition
---
Clash Royale: New Theme? That‚Äôs cute.
---
Yep I get you man, new brawlers are pretty neat but new maps or modes would be so much nicer for the time imo
---
I just want the skins
---
You enjoy the challenge, as do I. But remember that exists tryhards and cheaters, so if you can outpower your opponents legally, why not, right?
---

it makes them stupid, because you rely on rng, TO FUCKING PROGRESS IN TIHS GAME(gets worse with the fact that there are only 7 trophy road brawlers)
---
:(
---
thats pretty weird!

[lol](https://reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/brozyy/how_many_boxes_did_you_open_to_get_bibi/)
---
And also one time dinamike was the second trophy road brawler
---
Well i didnt realise he stole someone else's idea but either way its still cool
---
Every hit is a bloody stun, absolutely insanely op dude. Only if you're bad at playing her would you call her weak
---
I just want mortisüò≠
---
That's great!
---
Me 5 minutes after unlocking Rosa :  
---
I don't want to play with you anymore
---
Worst update was adding Rosa, period.
---
*spin now motherfucker*
---
Do you want me to screenshot it for you
---
no. not at all.
---
I one up this one
---
Omg he got all the rare brawlers and trophy road brawlers and got them so high that he is at 4500 omg such a pro
---
I opened 4 boxes and got Bibi + Carl
---
what exactly IS the heist meta right now? sometimes throwers dominate, and sometimes the tank rush seems to be the way to go. and sometimes Nita and her bear can carry the whole game.
---
No, thats when an enemy bibi has her baseball bar ful

A wheely automobily
---
the real question is, how does he only have 5 trophies, when you win in 0 trophy range, you should gain six
---
Sakura
---
CunningLinguist
---
Then if you're trapped in a corner with all the stars/gems, it would be best to jump at around 4.6 seconds so the game ends right before you land, wasting maximum time.
---
Agree
---
Oh, wow! You have so many trophies! I'm at around 9550.
---
no, her super always charged with a super and single attack.
---
Yea ‚Äúif‚Äù.  I can only wish
---
So your gonna charles bronson the sons a bitches? mad respect.

That was obvious since day one of beta

Check these ones than! https://imgur.com/a/i1ASS7g

Bibi helped. Already pushed her to 503. She‚Äôs a monster on ball. I have a mini in that club too. Richard head. Around 8500. ‚ÄúMini‚Äù üòÇ
---
BUFF MORTIS REEEEEE*
---
*is there any reason as to why I couldn‚Äôt?*
---
The update took only a month!
---
You can't just talk like you are the whole community.
---
Stop complaining, the devs do the best they can.
---
My mini's close to 5000. I'm still waiting on Bibi.

" Nerf me sideways üòÇ"

"ALSO, great lines with penny"

I didn't say penny said nerf me sideways.. ik that's leons lines
---
That‚Äôs because he crashed through the cieling, Bull has enough to deal with without having to pay for roof repairs
---
The way supercell goes
---
it was nerf later that same year, it basically had one of its balls cut off. anyway, Tier 10 is basically deathstar roulette, it's only fun if you are up against tanks that don't do 1.5k damage the moment you turn away your turret, if you plan to return, I advise you to enter under your own risk, it is a very toxic experience
---
It is better than one update every 3 months or so. It was kinda overhype tbh tho
---

100% real XD
---
They giving leaks about a new update tho
---
Great ideas 10/10 would brawl again
---
She‚Äôs super fun. Mechanics are a bit weird to get used to. But by the time you get her to rank 10 where it starts to get semi competitive, you‚Äôll figure it out.
---
Why do people not like siege? I love it. 
---
I think it‚Äôs a lot more fun than Bounty
---
Great art
---
That wasn‚Äôt a joke dumbass. At least make the comment more obvious like this: hAhA uR dUmB.
---
&gt;Using probability calculator i found on internet, by opening 356 boxes i have about 86%
---
Don‚Äôt forget those are just the odds after opening 356 boxes too. You can open 500 or even 1,000 boxes and still not get her. It‚Äôs unlikely, but still possible!
---
Either way, I think you are already crazy lucky for getting 8 star powers. It took me over 100 boxes just for one star power. Good pulls man!
---
Bounce it back to do more damage. It could've been a good star power but meh
---
No one:

You got Bibi tho...
---
Was this from the league rewards
---
Tbh the only that disappointed me was that there is no mortis buff. I think you're overreacting a little
---
plz dont remodel tara shes cool
---
Yes, no need to call the fbi on one another.
---
Yup, you dropped 50 trophies with Crow, oof
---
awesome stuff bro
---
I tried him today, and even though i have him at level 3, man, what a broken brawler. Got someone near a wall? Too bad for then.  
---
It really made him more viable for the FTP players, but i can feel the pain in those who have to face a Carl every match above 500 trophies. 
---
Also Jessie is broken and nobody seems to notice that
---
why exactly would a battle pass be *terrible*  
---
i mean i don't see anyone wanting it like crazy and neither do i but i don't think it'd be a bad addition either
---
"Epic Offer!"
---
Pfff!
---
Ah yes this one is extremely OG AF
---
What app is this?
---
Jessie is actually relatively balanced but can be a pain in the butt to face, she‚Äôs actually one of the hardest brawlers to push
---
\*ryan
---
‚ÄúNumber one!‚Äù
---
My problem with Bibi is that the knock bat hit she does when she has that yellow bar charged. It seems like a mostly pointless stun because... other than interrupting supers (such as Carl or Frank‚Äôs) it tends to hurt her more than help her as part of her kit. The knock back is at best a disengagement tool and at worse prevents you from killing your target. Maybe if the stun did a knock back similar to the way Bull‚Äôs super knock back does it, then maybe it could be useful. Due to her super having super long range, there‚Äôs no way anyone can accurately use the ricochet to its full potential, similar to old Darryl but at least it‚Äôs only a projectile and doesn‚Äôt put you in danger or near anyone so it‚Äôs fine with me. The normal attack is fine. She‚Äôs an ok brawler but I expect some changes to her kit soon. Hopefully.
---
jesus christ dont go generalizing an entire sub because of one person, a lot of us are grateful for what we can get from supercell
---
I opened eleven and got spike

Um, Chief Pat is trash.  Okay that's not fair, he isn't trash... but he does his best work when he is playing people that are trash.

This was update was fine, but imo they need to work on an update that doesn't focus on a new brawler or skins for once.

pick one lmao
---
She was literally just released a couple hours ago
---
Pam is my game ultra thicc is my game
---
In US we do that
---
They do, but just small amount, the higher rarity brawler you unlock the lower your legy chance will be. Read the boxes description
---
Why the heck did you just get 30 downvotes?
---
They could‚Äôve done more, I agree, but really, appreciate what they have done
---
No they just make games targeted toward very simple people
---
I don‚Äòt think they really considered this problem at all when they came up with the luck system
---
Nita is my name, bear is my game
---
And a Star Power, I wanna be lucky too
---
Lul I didn't notice, reddit's weird I guess
---
honestly fucking THIS  
---
i didn't like the update either and i definitely made a post about how frustrated i felt but this is also true  
---
though one thing i'd like to say is that yes, they can't do all of that stuff in one month, but nobody was asking for it to be added in ONE month, an update could take longer and give us more stuff, that way we would be excited for it more  
---
i was expecting retropolis to be that kind of update where we'd wait for way longer but it ended up coming out not long after and it was just kinda... empty.
---
Really love your work. I think the bouncy wall are a problem because even if you tried to balance it or him it removes his uniqueness. Keep doing great work üëç
---
‚ÄúHuh‚Äù
---
Nope, if you open boxes, eventually, it will increase
---
"You can breathe... You can blink. You can cry. Hell, you are all going to be doing that..."
---
They don‚Äôt come straight with the update, they release periodically after
---
People find it easier to judge than to be grateful. Its a free to play game not a five star hotel
---
Leon will never be balanced
---
Unless it‚Äòs less than 1k, then we hate you ;)
---
Then don‚Äôt buy it
---
No. Its a good skin. Its supposed to be funny. Additionally you're super late..
---
They refreshed it after the new update
---
I mean, i play 3v3 a lot, specially Brawl Ball, and i gotta say, she is pretty darn good in there. Gem Grab is the same. Not so much on Heist though, but i feel like everywhere i got there is a Jessie hanging arround, ready to shoot a guy on the other side of the map and hit you.
---
All i wanted is to make her main attack a little shorter, maybe 6% or 9%. I feel like a lot of the shots i hit (or get hit by) shouldn't have hitted.
---
Removed - Your post is too short, please expand on your title.
---
The skills in showdown are knowing which fights you can win, and how good you are at corner peaking, as well as aimming.
---
Bibi took it all away.
---
i just wasted 9 dollars...
---
Excuse me floating piece of cloth have you seen a dummy thicc purple man anywhere? 
---
ababhahh

&gt; Supercell is already short on 3D animators for all I know, and it‚Äôs not a very big team. It's a free game after all.

You're talking like Brawlstars is some tiny, plucky little indie game made by a couple of amateurs. It made $63 million in its first month.

Amazing? Portrait mode is dogshit. And you can barely see anything
---
yeah this should be her star power
---
as of you know, spot lights dont reveal you in bushes literally in every other stealth games
---
I agree 100%, passion for a game's flaws and possible fixes are a wonderful thing. But I usually just see sheer anger and whining. It's just annoying to me having to know that I share a game with lil bitches I guess :)
---
i don't see the problem with that tho
---
aaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhgggghhh.
---
Not neccesarily.
---
A stick is more laudable than a cow.
---
I've seen no Pam lewds.  Probably because of her protective thickness.
---
There are for sure things Supercell can do better, I'm with ya there. But this sub acts like we're all paying customers getting raped in front of our grandmother or something.
---
Lol, now that I see it, they actually do look alike!
---
Pam's and colt's star powers are one of the best in the game. Especially in ticketed events. You can use pam on robo rumble for that consistent healing and you can use colt to run around in boss fight. Shelly's star power is the only thing that makes her super useful because without it it only dose 500 damage or something. Maybe a little more the closer you get. That slow can give your team the opportunity for a crucial pick like letting your gene pull the pam with 10 gems or slowing the piper so your piper can get that pick. 
---
Primo's star power is useless don't get it
---
Advertising dude? Must be new to reddit.
---
how about reporting you for spamming?
---
cuz i did.
---
As if it had any skill to begin with. All the bibi's on SD is completely normal because she was literally just released so whenever we get a new brawler you'll see them on SD
---
Yeah just you
---
Backstab lul
---
Thank you!
---
It's the other parts that's meant to be funny
---
El Primo is here
---
Beautiful reminds me of the old days of elixir and chips
---
Hell no.

Lol
---
Better rephrase that, because they are not updating. They are talking about the update, and they have been for almost two years.
---
That was my next idea.
---
yeah. Better be good lol.
---
FBI is here to raid the FBI which is raiding the Redditor

---
Yea typo
---
Thx to for your reply mr.ponko
---
Yeah, my vid is more of a tips video though, you know, more for beginners. But i get your point
---
so torches work on everything, even colt? i mean if u shoot 1 bullet will it light the whole chain? and for shield how about when ur shield has max health it just leaves it there
---
Such a good bargain, imagine what you can buy with that 1 gem you save
---
Pam and colt star power are nowhere close to that good. Colt is a C or B tier and pam is a D, she would be an F if robo rumble didn‚Äôt exist, as thats the only place its ever useful. Shelly‚Äôs is only good if you need to run but wasting your super to do it isnt real smart in most cases.
