I love the entertainment, we're lucky to have these selfless teamers provide a brilliant show.
---
Wow wp
---
If gene can only super the primo
---
He is actually called “stick” in the Italian version because he is as fragile as a stick
---
Thanks!
---
I love when that happens. As long as I'm the Gene.
---
Are your other brawlers at like 200 trophies 😂
---
Sorry formatting, uploaded from mobile.
---
This time i was 😎
---
Happy cake day!
---
Star Shelly was a limited time skin given to players who launched the game before Jan 1, 2019, so there’s unfortunately no way for you to unlock the skin anymore.
---
Where’s the dad
---
Awwwww they're so adorable!
---
Were you also aware that you can try out the Bunny Penny early?
---
... wonder if people actually look at posts here
---
the cathedral memes aren't really that funny cause its just some old building that no one cares about
---
Epic Mortar Placement
---
I just noticed bcz I have music off and turned it on yesterday. I didn’t not know ): this was the best song
---
Shelley: oh so your coming to me
---
Primo: yes how else am I gonna get my super
---
I honestly think her silence fits her character the most. It really gives off the "mysterious stranger in town" vibe, but regardless, these quotes are great too :)
---
mortis
---
is forced to face check everything
---
low health pool
---
low damage
---
is countered by aimbot
---
low move speed
---
is mortis
---
Yup! And the way you avoided crow super is genius. I ♥️ penny because of these moments.
---
Because he's Korean. Kotrans are crazy serious when it comes to video games.
---
Yeah that’s not the point i found a bug, the point of the post wasn’t about trying skins you don’t have
---
If you could get a new Brawler from the Daily Box, you wouldn’t have a pick of three rewards, it would just give you the Brawler.
---
Holy shit that must have took hours
---
The dog became the gun
---
To get 1 more trophy?
---
she doesn't need a buff to anything maybe a nerf
---
Looks like fortnite the season 5
---
Agreed! She/he is so underrated!
---
My chances of someone actually relating to this graph is less than the red piece.
---
it annoys how people use this template wrong...
---
I have two 16s and two 15s and the rest are like 12s
---
/r/woooosh/
---
The point is this, and the penny bunny thing, have been posted about a 1000 times this week.
---
I have a hard time believing this
---
Yeah, agreed! I’ve said that to a few other people who have said what if I misclick. That would be the only solution unless you couldn’t get Brawler drops from the Daily Box.
---
Me too, buddy, except mine was power 2
---
CoLt: I WANt My MomMy
---
Star power seems too op, he could troll other players by stealing their cubes easily
---
I can definitely hear her voice (while reading this) having a mysterious dramatic effect. Really cool lines!
---
this is funny
---
30 min
---
Lmfaoo
---
I just like how when one of them attacks it goes into complete chaos
---
no，trolling is so fun
---
Yeah
---
Yes, and I did
---
This just made my day lmao they got it coming!!
---
Starting Sunday, at 08:00 AM, on BrawlTV
---
Shelly is super OP in low-trophy showdown
---
lol
---
#CrOw LoOkS cUtE aF
---
OMG AMAZING THIS IS HEAVEN 😍
---
There’s always one comment like this lmao
---
In addition to those two, I cant hear enemy Nitas either.
---
I just noticed that as well.
---
Wow amazing bug!!
---
Some brawlers hit boxes are greater than one block so you cant have one block gaps in maps, like the idea though
---
What about the robos?
---
Tanks like Shelly and Bull easily overpower Leon, but thats something that occured even prior to Leon's nerf.
---
Leon's great for his ability to poke at long range and his high damage output at close combat.
---
Imo 7s seconds is still a valid Super duration and most of the time you'll find yourself to attack even before the effect vanishes anyway.
---
Tfw you can finally understand a certin brawler meme
---
This comment made me HAVE SEX
---
theres a simble at crow's jacket that looks like her so they might related im just guessing
---
Lol that’s what happens when you grind too much
---
perfectly balanced as all things should be
---
His pupils are on the eagle. He is blind so he uses his Eagles cap(Eagles fanboy) to see.
---
Very cute, but still she needs a nerf
---
Made a viking skin for poco so he can rock out on his "axe" guitar
---
I think you should change the poison for bleeding. Basically the same, but I think it would help differentiate them from eachother.
---
Only Mortis mains will understands
---
Pene
---
I struggled for like 3 weeks to get my max Rico to 500...
---
It's a shame. Wish they increased the limit or had no limit?
---
F
---
I like crushing peoples spirits so, my hamster can draw better than you u little *#@&gt;
---
Nice catch haha
---
So Shelly is going to punch El Primo?
---
Your a bit late
---
I thought Bo was about to shot himself
---
You don't know that
---
r/woooosh
---
I think you mean Koreans are dedicated in general
---
The massive multiple backstabs its amazing.
---
I prefer thiccochet

Nope, there’s no whoosh here.

no because you're a simple minded tool

U wanna stop the spin, r/BringLifeLeechBack

Now you trying to end the argument cuz you know you lost
---
If he lands directly on you his daggers don’t hit u cause they shoot from some kind a radius that is bigger than ur bralwer

Why are you posting this here

#laughs in laughness noise

yes my internet wasnt on my phone

Wtf

Kris

feels bad, man

I’m not sure if you can see but it already has two....

There was one made with Poco
---
This isn’t the original, I photoshopped the third one out
---
If 🙏 dey 👌 wont ❌ shut up 🤐 cunfuce dem🤔
---
Very cool. More please!
---
I see you have the whole horse and we are both cool animals
---
Valid point, but I still feel that the amount of damage is a lot for the range of the character ie: penny only does 1176 per shot at max
---
They are not addictive. They are just fun. Generally after doing mushrooms you tend to want to wait a bit before doing it again as to not diminish the experiences and build a tolerance fast. Psychedelics build tolerance faster than any drug. To be addicted to shrooms would mean youd have to double your prior dosage everytime you want to trip. It would be insane the amount youd have to take. Mushrooms are not addictive. Getting fucked up is addictive tho
---
WOW THATS THE BEST ART IVE SEEN. Also r/BringLifeLeechBack - just adding this in case anyone wants to sign up
---
Good idea! I think more people should make posts like this. I liked 'fingers crossed' and 'you're in the wrong place at the wrong time', but a lot of the rest seemed like they would fit Gene more, even though he already has lines (barely). Tara's lines should be more geared towards cards and luck but not wishes and fortunes. Just my opinion, but once again, good idea!

Lmfao I got carl

i saw it somewhere else, it was also golden week

That colt is getting tortured for sure

Whats wrong lmao

There is a report join their club and tap on their name in chat

How's that possible

Literally this post is getting upvotes because of that stupid grammar mistake

how do you get New updates??????
---
Wut.
---
Bruh 👨🏿‍🦱 I ☝🏿Will 👇🏿 literally 👁👄👁 eat 👅 up ⬆️ your ✊🏿 village 🛤 that People 🧙🏿‍♂️ are starving 🥢 in

its the player's name

Bull has no range whatsoever
---
Oh ok im retarded
---
if someone didnt get it look at the player's name
---
Cacti don't speak lmao!
---
Par for course for this sub, plenty of yoots. Nothing wrong with that of course, this is their sandbox.
---
I agree that it's self destructive and maybe the values. But I came from a great, loving home and had very high values/morals. As did many addicts. There was four year before things got bad. I'd get high at work but was top performer. I'd get high at family functions but dance with Grandma and entertain the kids. I'd get high at funerals but deliver a heartfelt eulogy. I wasn't really trading anything in for my addiction. I was a saint with a nasty secret. Eventually it all fell apart but I don't think it's as easy to call it like you are seeing it.
---
I will say though that I thought exactly like you before I ended up homeless on skid row. Obviously in hindsight I simply never should have started or at least never should have kept going.
---
If I was allergic to strawberries I wouldn't have kept cramming them into my mouth. So how come i kept on tempting fate? Wasn't for lack of education, environment, etc ... 🤷
---
I didnt get it either until I read your comments lol xD
---
Nobody say there is a matchmaking.
---
Mini P.E.K.K.A would be happy with her.
---
I know, the post is so unclear.
---
I have no idea
---
I agree that all of the characters you listed are very good, however I would still take gene over them in all team situations. I acknowledge that this may just because I play him so much that I favor him
---
He got nerfed harder than crow in a month
---
Yeah, that probably would have ruined everything.
---
I lost to that thing once, after a Tara and Bo killed each other. I got caught in the portal AND the mines, and was one hit away from killing it. Died, then the no powercube Piper farming the mushrooms in the poison won.
---
Honestly, this is not bad matchmaking, this is just bad luck going up against P2W’s
---
Ye. Heist and bounty can never be on the same day
---
Asian eyes

He’s not good anymore

i got 250 on my mini it was insane

thats the point of buff

THX 4 feedback. I will do an improved version soon :)
---
Do you think he has changed the meta? I saw lots of high level player using him and not Pam anymore. Gene with his star power replaced Pam I guess.
---
I meant watch without audio1
---
Not with rico cuz he’s not good when he bush camps in sd but I bush camped when I was pushing my lvl1 bull to 500😂
---
**Oh**? You're approaching me? **Instead** **of running** **away**, you're coming right to me?

DONT MESS WITH THE CREATURE OF THE NIGHT

Because it’s a glitch
---
 Underrated
---
Yep, we play this game to have fun not hoard trophies
---
El cactus 
---
Cactus aim for dynamite instead
---
Nice
---
Btw lolz love the sarcasm
---
Carl currently is amazing on every map due to his versatility. As for tips, all you have to do is hit people and charge your super, as your super is a great escape tool as well as a finisher.
---
Rosa
---
I don’t think Carl will change the meta per say, but he is very viable on every mode and map currently
---
the first person 2 get all brawlers 500 at level one said that rico was the easiest brawler 2 do
---
Wow. Nice job Supercell. I wish it worked all the time. Teamers will far apart. That time, this becomes useless
---
Yea I'm glad he got a slight buff but... They really should change his star power and just have his pickaxe speed be the star power speed.
---
I'm sure there are plenty of more interesting and better star powers they could give, especially with his unique character type.  Eg. While axe is in the air, Carl gains movement speed/damage shield.  This would allow for more aggressive or skillful playstyles with him.
---
False
---
El primo's image should have *29 gems above him*

CoMpLeTeLy UnPlAyAbLe

I'm not crying, I have 7.6K Reddit points. It's nothing to brag about and I don't know why one would, but I don't have to worry about this anymore. I was just explaining the other side of this.
---
Carl now most OP brawler.
---
Sorry.  My internet wouldn't work
---
Better then the current remodel
---
It’s actually from titan fall
---
Actually no new players have it lowest
---
I thought about this too...
---

---
My internet wouldn't work.  Sorry dude
---
Dude ik it 475 frank but he try other brawler with me that like rank 15 the same thing happen again i just need a tip stop these stuff
---
OP
---
Can I add you bro?
---
sub pewds guys, t bad
---
6 seconds remaining --&gt; 12 seconds remaining
---
That CARL realizes this but it was too late
---
More pls
---
“after one accidental auto aims”
---
yeah, no.
---
The good ol' days. And mike's glassed too. Anyway, wanna add me?
---
Wish this was the remodel for Bo the new one is meh this one is just AWESOME
---
Mostly randos but sometimes clubmates and randos ive added cuz they gud.
---
Laughs in rosa
---
How? Was it the fanfiction?
---
I've lost 50 trophies playing with randoms today. Just trying to get stars..
---
A bit weird cuz Nita is floating
---
Super looks like a Petri dish of nuggs lol
---
Pretty sure halo did it first :)	haven't had the opportunity to play town fall, so never knew!
---
Still on lol
---
Ive lost 100cups about 4 times already with randos. My470 penny dropped to 300,lost om brock colt jessie piper bull. But what can ya do.
---
In the end i came second the brocks died leon died only nita was left with 11 cubes
---
Is this Piper's relative? Lmao just kidding, nice idea.. Also Unique Star Power! :0
---
Imo this should be for gene
---
Since u know his super - to make it cooler
---
Removed - DO NOT SUBMIT POSTS WITH TITLES IN ALL CAPS. CAPS LOCK IS CRUISE CONTROL FOR COOL

Pryan is ironic.. Because of that moment.. in Brawl Talk
---
*pam let me see the kids*
---
CREDITS TO - rynnu the owner of the picture. I'm not good at drawing so I used other's photo just to conceptualize my brawler idea thnxx! 
---
This brawler named Twitch is a ghost brawler that can pass through walls in her super state. 
---
Health - 3800
---
Basic Attack - 920-1260 (8.3 tiles) 
---
Basic Attack (Dead shot) - Twitch shoots projectiles in a forward direction that can pierce through enemies dealing 920 pts of damage to targets. If the projectile doesn't hit an enemy target at the end of the basic attack, it creates a circular explosion cloud (d=3 tiles) dealing 420 pts of damage to enemies standing inside the explosion cloud. 
---
Super (Oh my Ghost) - When Twitch activates her super, she enters Ghost state for 5 seconds. In her Ghost state, she can pass through walls and deals 20% more damage and increases her movement speed by 20%. Enemies can see Twitch if she is passing through walls and disappear again after passing (if she is in the bush). After 5 seconds, she will back to her normal state and removes the buffs from her ghost state. 
---
Star power - Everytime an enemy brawler has been slain, they will leave a gravestone. Twitch can pass through the gravestone when she is in her Ghost state to increase the duration of her ghost state by 0.7 seconds each gravestone she passes by. (gravestones disappear after she passed by it).
---
What can you say guys?
---
why not make challenge where you can get the new character before official release like in clash royale?
---
What does she do?
---
Also the way you calculated it is wrong anyway. you want to calculate the proportion of total trophies won to to total trophy change: 14044/(14044+7869)= 64% win rate assuming +5 for a win and -5 for a loss. Think about it this way: if there was no trophy "infusion" system, if you lost in more than 50% of your games, you'd be at a negative trophy count.
---
Ok I will use piper in bounty
---
I'm french but I foud this funny
---
1- Pick a brawler that has a bee skin. 
---
2-Swipe to new skin as you press try.
---
Hmm. Seems balanced to me.
---
Sick auto aim at the end
---
The stats are there 👆👆
---
In other news, a newly discovered plant punching species lays waste to a village.
---
Ok so you mean you want to stop teaming but tou team
---
stupid piece of crap
---
Dare I ask what it was
---
I get it im sorry i didnt know i didnt see anyone else post it can you guys just please stop sending hate im sorry
---
Yess i feel like wen need something colder and new
---
Dude i teamed to save my trophy you would do the same its more like self defense idiot
---
now darryl, leon &amp; spike
---
I just wanted to do something a little coy and high quality because I was bored with the same things.
---
I dont blame u, but just in case, this is how I rank each brawler to their rarity:
---
Trophy Road=Just casual.
---
Rare= Original and not like the other brawlers.
---
Super Rare= Has special mechanics or upgraded version of Trophy Road.
---
Epic= Extremely powerful brawlers but has obvious flaws.
---
Mythic= Brawlers with 'mythical' designs.
---
Legendary= Unique brawlers
---
well, colt just wants his mommy and leon needs a lollipop. isn't that easy, pam?
---
Wow , I literal was just thinking of this idea 😂
---
Her DPS is only slightly lower than Primo. That's not low, at all.
---
Ah man they have maintenance
---
Ikr, hopefully the big big update will come in June since that’s when Brawl Stars was technically released for beta, hopefully in May though cus that’s when the massive update was last year
---
Best clip I have ever seen
---
That black eyeshadow though, damn
---
Look a furry
---
Yes
---
You just said that the modifiers barely work, then just admitted they do work...
---
I'm seeing a lot of these type videos and I love em
---
Wait, how?
---
O my god. When Carl came out I saved up in total 6 big boxes but I never even reached 3 because I kept opening them by accident...
---
Use walls as a cover and shot the enemy.
---
Rank up a brawler
---
Im 9k still no legies
---
Yup, mine was a couple days ago at 5.8k
---
That’s what I’m already doing my friend. So far have managed to crawl past 300 with 4 of my brawlers. I am upgrading all the brawlers to 5 or more like you said.  But I doubt I can ever push rico
---
👍
---
8.7k not even a mythic.
---
They made matchmaking "better".
---
Impact font. Nice.
---
Pretty sure like 10-15min max
---
I’m sorry am I missing something? This looks like solid matchmaking to me
---
They broke the game with the latest update.
---
Yeah sure go ahead, will it be on YouTube?
---
But they should make modifiers more frequent, because the two map rotations before that were all non-modifier.
---
No i tried \ • • /
---
But i cant eat it :/
---
The guys in my team are not that close to 500 trophies, with a power level disadvantage.
---
*Creaking noises*
---
*Bull rush outta here*
---
Yeah Rico is hard to learn, but after level 5 you should only level up 1 or 2 Brawler to level 9 and than level up the next brawlers, so you the chance to get a star power.
---
Your "app"
---
Man, if you're using "apps", don't even try. You need to use real software like photoshop, not the shit with filters on your phone.
---
Ya
---
u need money for gems.
---
You lost to a team with a slightly lower average trophy count? The matchmaking is fine.
---
Everyone keeps saying furry to this post but forgot Crow is in the game and that Nita is damn near fursuiting
---
I used Photoshop
---
Its not gonna be rosa
---
It does sound pretty legit
---
Noob
---
They had no skill.
---
Correct. 
---
One time i was low i wanted to attack but i pulled the frank.....but i wanted to attack.
---
So sad
---
Not if I saved some gems already ;D
---
Ooh sheeeeeeet! I have Jesse 7 and 4 brawlers at 6 and a few at 5. Feelsbadman
---
showdown matches take 2 mins and 30 secs for the gas to come in
---
Yeah, but they did some good things like anti-teaming things which true teamers like me don't like but m fine with that cuz teaming still gives me top 5 rank.
---
 But I also wish we could use max brawlers in training cave
---
This would honestly be great, fits him pretty well. Only thing is I’d rather have him and mortis not talk bc it just fits them better imo. If they ever do happen to give him dialogue tho this should be it
---
See my last post
---
Your teammates had no skill?
---
X to doubt
---
Und du kommst aus Deutschland ?
---
More of these please!
---
You used the wrong template boy...
---
5.5k and its legendary dry over here.
---
I got mine at 4.5k trophies too! And got spike at 5k. Nice one man!
---
I'll take it
---
You can just get first place easily in todays mal in showdown withput teaming, the healing mushrooms will protect you.
---
Sorry for grammar mistakes but my text app sucks and it's difficult to correct mistakes
---
Yeah, but like I said I am salty so you should just probably ignore this pointless post
---
Ja 👀
---
Doesn't happen always bro, and I can't fight with 3-4 ppl with healing mushrooms or energy drinks
---
I am for sure not your cousin
---
r/gatekeeping
---
Also F for the Piper, we will ~~not~~ miss you
---
Now I have 5.4k and have Carl as well. This was before Carl was out
---
I'm at 7.5k trophies and got crow, but still missing Gene, the other legendaries and Carl
---
Really nice map!!!
---
Thanks 😊
---
Idk man!! First for me to see this. Mine is 8 characters
---
me too , wait robots have saliva
---
Lo penso anche io, ma si dice "rosa" anche in latino
---
Tank???
---
Congrats
---
I could only think of 1 voice line when spike uses his super.
---
“MIGHTY SPIKE”
---
Agree
---
Nice fortnut gameplay bro lmaoooo
---
at school.. 
---
piper: hey bull, can i borrow a bull-pen? 
---
ok im soRry..
---
Shit post
---
Give turret some love
---
Also, dunno if that's on purpose but there's two "in"s in the top one. 
---
Maybe, "Throw bottles in front"?
---
yea
---
But shiba nita
---
Give me Rosa , pleas
---
Yes, yes that is right! I’m texting too fast
---
Awesome art! Even though i don't think I'm qualified enough to critique, i have a suggestion. Keep the bandita eye patch completely in, or completely out. The semi-patch feels kinda (?) Disturbing.

He looks a fucking grandpa.
---
I want to buy rockabily or mortina(night witch) which is better?
---
English is not my language, but I understand a little. Some characters like Crow and Carl have some phrases that I can't understand. Subtitles would help a lot! Besides, it's probably not even that hard to add.
---
wait tagrez i know you
---
Shelly, bull And el primo in one box? You're so lucky!
---
No you don’t 😂
---
Your post has been removed, make sure to use the body of a post to elaborate on the title.
---
Hey, ignore that mean comment - I like this one :)
---
They look amazing O-O
---
Depends on what you choose. I would choose Mortina because he looks cooler in game. But I like rockabilly but he doesn’t look as good as mortina in game.
---
How much will the bunny penny cost?
---
Night witch Mortis 59gems, now 150 I think
---
Serenade Poco, Popcorn Rico 109gems, now both 150
---
It really do be like dat sometimes
---
Full respect
---
what the hell how did you find me here
---
Oh wait
---
My profile
---
I was thinking if is it good for that meme template but becouse it is brawl stars related i must have used it. Great job
---
Share to your friends on Reddit so that Supercell sees this
---
Nice idea
---
Sorry, but no.
---
Brawler with shots that just "chase" down enemies is an extremely bad idea for the game. They are extremely difficult to balance and does nothing to improve the game at all. Not to mention that we already have a ton of brawler that is extremely easy to use and requires minimal to no skill.
---
Better keep these "easy to use but op" brawler fantasies to yourself.
---
If you're going to suggest brawler ideas without image, at least suggest one that is unique in mechanics and requires some skill to use.
---
I little😂
---
\&gt; regardless of modifiers   
---
\&gt; having a drink   
---
Pick one side.
---
fucking everyone says all the bralwers are under 18 at this point its just a kid death match for who ever gets the last cookie with the green sippy cup
---
I think i might
---
Yep, she's a tank. Her super makes her quite invincible, tho
---
Lol
---
I don't think anyone can stop me from teaming. I am not against anyone but I just want to play the game in the way I like to. I can't afford to get defeated because it is very irritating to dp that untilting
---
Next Friday
---
I got my first mythic at 2000 (mortis) the pam later on. I got piper at about 1500 throphies
---
But i’m getting bunny penny cuz i’m broke from red nose nita
---
Thank you! I plan on making more in the future

If thats your wish ok...

Night witch mortis is a disease and you should never get it. You already have the best mortis skin, top hat mortis. If you do want to buy a skin save for shiba nita or bunny penny
---
in brawl stars i’m your friend V O R T E X
---
look at the CrowGang subreddit
---
Yeah xd!
---
Hell yeah man
---
No that's not the case, tanker in brawl star is called heavyweight, right?
---
Can't you tell this is probably an 8-year-old kid coming up with this genius idea?
---
More player = more money man, who would have thought? /s
---
Just hit 420 trophies on Barley today too, 500 grind is nuts.
---
:) have a nice day
---
Showdown is battle Royale
---
It's attached to his hair. He has INCREDIBLE neck strength.
---
Lets downvote all of his posts so he goes crying to him momma .
---
same whit piper

Hello! I'd like to ask you if I could use your clip as a part of my compilation of Brawl Stars Highlights. I'm an editor for the Gaming Curios network. You would be credited with your name on the screen along with a link to this post. Let me know, thank you! :)
---
nice original meme
---
Is this boss fight or brawl ball ?
---
Probably save them up, open them when rosa gets released and then if you dont get her you will still get gems to buy her
---
They are right tho.
---
El Poco

You are telling me i was rude you started being rude i just asked you with 0 rudeness whatsoever
---
\*thicco\*

&amp;#x200B;
---
edit: I came
---
Uhhh what 600 karma Lol
---
Its a rare brawler so it will not be hard to get her. This offer is just perfect!
---
The fight is in the desert and showdown takes place in a desert.
---
but hotter*
---
You to
---
Only how to train your dragon fans will remember
---
I just got that today 😍
---
Apparently bandit is *LEON*
---
Could be interesting; how many per team?
---
wow didn’t see the gene pull until it hit.
---
I love this game :0
---
I'm not willing to spend a single penny on games, and if I had enough gems I would buy but I'm broke so I can't really complain.
---
600 karma's on my profile lol😂
---
Wow wow just wow
---
frank is unfairy in brawl ball now
---
Let's appreciate that Tara needed a dialogue box just to say "..."
---
:(

Why repost?

She looks young.
---
Many players do not know English and this is not a minority.
---
I’m afraid that’s accurate lol
---
Bro I felt that. It's worse when you can't move, or you struggle to move but then go back to where you started
---
This too. I feel as the higher I go in trophies the less my teammates contribute
---
Also side note. I've get hit by more Jessie attacks bouncing off my teammates then I do her shooting me. Jessie feels punishing to have bad teammates with
---
Ikr lol
---
Oh No! I’m next...
---
So true
---
MORTIS GANG
---
But its 25 gem deal
---
Wut
---
Token doublers = more crates.
---
New skin = ...New skin. 
---
My gems go on token doublers every time.
---
sledge foos
---
He doesn't have shoes lol
---
/León/ because I'm Spanish 😂😂 and I live in León 😂😂😂😂😂
---
Dallas area?
---
What do you want?
---
Wow this is so well done! In my head, this is sounds cute like penny
---
It looks really good regardless!! I just couldn’t figure out why the picture looked a little off😂
---
Im a f2p who has played for almost 2 years, now 9600 trophies. Still the same problem, my random teammates' trophies are around 380-420 while I'm playing 470 spike. Now it's 420 :). Can't believe the showdown performance of my random teammate(like trying to 1v2 high power team instead of escaping, like wow. Instant -6)
---
101%
---
So, basically ammumu?
---
Maybe, but he could've at least TRIED lmao
---
The 25 gem one is a limited time one time purchase, the 50 gem one is always available.
---
I’m talking about deaf players. And I’m pretty sure if they don’t know English subtitles aren’t going to help.
---
people can see gunshots and bottle splashing, but can’t understand or hear phrases
---
Yea that is true would have been better at least 🌚
---
post this on r/lootstars next time
---
My showdown teammates just run the opposite direction of me and can't dodge skillshots. My 300 trophy power 4 dynamike (I got him there at power 3) can go toe to toe with power 10 brocks sometimes but the game is more than that one power 10 brock
---
Have you watched the office?

He a robot doe
---
All that for a drop of oil (with shield on)
---
I agree that it’s not worth 150 gems but if you know supercell, then lowering the price of something or compensating players isn’t something they do
---

Press try while going to bunny penny
---
Lol, you’re absolutely right, SleepyHarry. 
---
Learn your math, Guys.
---
What terrible advice... This is literally the best gem/token value offer we have seen. After buying that for 25 he would still have 12 gems. If they happen to not get Rosa from saved up boxes, I'm sure they would get 7 more gems.
---
I too do not enjoy Morris
---
Buy some upgrades and quit being cheap lol. If they match it via power levels people who just started the game and bought boxes to level their brawlers would get punished for supporting the games development by f2p player that have been playing since beta upgrading their brawlers as they tweak their skills.
---
Its matchmaking based on experience. Nothings perfect, but it's much better than going by power levels. 
---
They can make some of the players happy all the time, all the players some of the time...but it's impossible to make all players happy all of the time...except that first leon nerf lol! It was needed and everybody knew it
---
everyone knows
---
I mean like youll be just out of distance and it will hit you, that's what it seems like
---
I like Penny more
---
If you have lock movements turned off the joystick will follow your finger but if you have it turned on it will stay in one place.
---
Though it would be distracting to read something while fighting
---
i have to say its like when i play solo showdown with poco almost all the time
---
True.
---
Whats wrong is that this person can directly comment on Gedi's comment section. Why does he need to post another same pic just to say he likes it?
---
Fuckin teamers..
---
Then just reply to that post, imagine if everyone who likes something reposts it
---
Got in brawl tv once. Was the first person to die. 😑
---
I spend money on the game but never on skins. But if you play just for fun and don't bother about cups or new brawlers go for skin, else, general rule of thumb, always buy discounted token doublers
---
That's really smart. The turret shoooting tennis balls 😂
---
I know, that’s why I added the /s
---
Not the point still. It's not hard to get positive karma if you're not a shitty person. Will it take you another post to get yourself there? Maybe. But I'll take that over trolls.
---
and a quick question, how do you show your fav brawler next to your nickname, i wanna do it too but i couldnt find
---
Does it matter, no one's gunna like it but them
---
"Beep Boop I'm a robot." Is my favorite
---
Name : Blowing L's Designed For Dynamikes
---
This guy is obviously trying to get upvotes as a post with pics will get lots of attention
---
Thank you!
---
Dude,im 11,7k at level 150.I know what I’m talking about
---
But you teamed with a bear that sacrificed itself at the start smh my head
---
thakns u/gedi-kor,very cool!
---
It is called brain
---
Imagine nita, jessie, poco, barley, penny and darryl gets in a match in this map
---
Reddit is a fair use based bussiness, they do not need gedis permission to repost nor do they have to give a link of credit. The fact that most people ignore the fact that it's a fair use company is rather astonishing
---
If only one of these could make it into the Game, ah my Gems.....
---
😢
---
Duo showdown..
---
They are using it as criticism, so they dont need permission.
---
In the new one he sits crooked and hes ugly. Plus his dance was cute and it wasnt annoying as Dyna's , where his hands fly up and down up and down .
---
Yeah, they should keep the same mechanic, just add a 25% chance for random in ring spawn.
---
new map on brawl stars game name is miksuofficial
---
OP 😍
---
Stop
---
I see 0, in duo
---
this is so cute :o i love the colors
---
I'm idiot..
---
I hate it when I accidentally click “send friend request” then I have to make sure they don’t add me and if they do I need to remove them since I’m just about max friend spots
---
I lost 10k
---
Because the one who killed the enemy was the IKE, not you. They won't change it because it is working as intended
---
Hahahah this is awesome!!!
---
You know in a meme format you shouldnt pit watermarks because then people who use the format will be excused for repost
---
oh que bien xD
---
This shit actually works!
---
Yess finally you unlocked Jessie!
---
Gonna cry? Gonna piss your pants maybe...?
---
Look since some people got the chance to get him and keep him, we all should get that chance, or take him off the people who got him and give them back 19 gems, but never gonna happen.....
---
The cannon is going to shoot tennis balls but, what is going to shoot Jessie with a racket?...
---
some ideas?
---
Traced but okay. There is a real post with the same exact characters in the same positions
---
Yep 
---
His phrases are VEEEEEEEEEERY LOOOOOONG
---
Nice one
---
Shelly, El Primo, Spike, Bull left the chat
---
....dear gedi-kor
---
I really really love youre skin ideas. And i really want to play with them. And i questioned earlier.
---
How are you doing with 3D arts now? 
---
You Absolutely have time of course! 
---
You really dont need to answer if you dont want to. Have a nice day!
---
-david ;)
---
When is the skin going to expire?
---
Yup.
---
It says it there , 400 Brawler Trophies so if ye want them replays you gotta get grinding
---
diomikes
---
I have same box deployment with Brock and I kill el primo and piper with super in the middle
---
Shes really op tho
---
Skin change*
---
Cool,eh?
---
High quality content I joined for
---
Apparently not here
---
Thanks
---
Before anyone asks, idk why i got mega boxes.
---
Lol, you are right
---
he's just too lit
---
Absolutely! Could you send me a link to the video when it's finished?
---
I never said otherwise...??? I’m referring to people thinking the building is gone.
---
Becausssssss... *Irat4k left the chat*
---
He does have a new dance animation.
---
Go eat a cow you ducking doughnut
---
But you should have gave credit to the author of the idea
---
Its so much better lol
---
# LeT's MaKe S0mE FrIeNdS BoIZ
---
Shelly disagrees.
---
**bull proceeds to run after you the whole game, then you get trapped by 2 Dynamikes and a 100+ powercube shelly**
---
Simple answer:
---
#  N  O
---
It would be nice
---
Says the el primo main
---
Fair enough!
---
How dare you use night bitch mortis
---
Using his super:
---
# G0TtA Go FaSt
---
Have you seen any people complaining about Mortis? That he's bad or anything? I didn't. If you can't play a brawler right - don't complain.
---
ok keep hating cuz I'll just afk from the start anyway
---
No, he uses his psychic abilities to manipulate other Mike's into being his friends.
---
Supercell did it, Supercell said the P word! (kill me, its the worst joke)
---
there are lots of carls
---
I mean I have Leon but that triggers me. One day I unlocked Tara and he unlucked Leon at the same day. And also he unlucked Carl before me! The luck system is trash. Since then I've opened a couple of boxes and nothing has changed. My legendary rate is still at 0.048%...
---
Yeah, balance changes that came out a couple of days ago. They also do more damage
---
# MAGIC
---
I feel like a lot of players can agree that's a top reason they lose.
---
Superstar
---
Wow, this is very complex.
---
How’d you do that?
---
IKR
---
By the way I was pretty proud of the 69 tokens and the 1420 trophies
---
Making the text big, or the weird faces?
---
No no I’m more complaining about that Shelly I had on my team the last game.. dude has highest trophies of like 1k. Playing all 4K and up people. He was literally shooting walls and trying to snipe like piper but as Shelly..
---
Brawl Stars has literally changed me
---
literally xD
---
100% agreed i always know im gonna get a win when a Mortis is on the other team
---
Actually yes, a lot of people claim he’s the worst. At least he doesn’t bush camp 🤷‍♂️
---
Beheaded 🤷‍♂️
---
This gave me a jumpscare
---
EEEEEEEEEEEEEEL
---
Oh yeah, I LOVE bushcamping. Of course every El Primo main is a teamer, camper and, I don't know, just bad?
---
ohhh you children the true bwta players only know the satisfaction of having this coin boos and coin doubler
---
I’m just a saying that full price mega boxes are a waste, if you want to spend money, wait for the 49 gem or 60 gem mega box offers. Yes, buying boxes is the easiest way to max an account, but buying full price boxes isn’t the cheapest
---
I hope you know that this is just a suggestion for a buff. Have you seen how long it takes to reload a shovel.
---
hi
---
Yep 😅
---
What's with the bottle?
---
why you cover up your stats but show your brawler id lol
---
Well yes. And everyone fine with this. WhY iS pIpEr'S rElOaD iS sO lOnG?!
---
rlly cool!🙏🏻
---
i use a mirror type attack to make you get an upvote
---
Haha Yh thanks, I think he has some potential to be good brawler but he’s not very strong against some brawlers.
---
Make a mini account and fuck around a bit
---
Both
---
Three in a row, 32 trophies
---
Thats a really nice jessy skin
---
Making an observation does not equal being toxic :) Learn the difference :)
---
No cus nobody has this cured app
---
I think it somehow connects with large pheonix crow
---
20 boxes - 10 boxes is 10 boxes
---
You meant the best camping strategy
---
Hey, that’s not fair! Now I have to give you another upvote!
---
Yo i saw that from the winning teams perspective
---
that makes me have to give you an upvote too
---
At higher level its not as good... penny doesn’t do enough dps and isn’t tanky enough to be “too good” she’s balanced
---
I think we need to stop...
---
Nah, have another upvote!
---
Please study 3d graphic design. I love this so much 😭😭😭😭😭😭
---
*why do I hear a dozen sirens*
---
Im pretty sure shelly is a female lol

all thats left to do the background and the colour of spike

Probably gonna name it "Jump Start" unless I get a better name.

So beautiful and lovely drawing. Good Illustration of Teamwork😍💖❤️
---
This looks super cute ☺️
---
Everytime someone on this reddit says "please stop posting about this, it's annoying" Like, hundreds of  others start saying the same shit when in this case, there's like 3 bunny penny glitch posts.
---
Will this ever stop? (insert upvote)
---
summer game event?
---
I use crow in all the modes exept siege of course 
---
Also i dont like showdown so i play one with him for star token then i change modes also 
---
Nerf crow to his original state
---
i pushed my 2 only 500 trophy brawlers with randoma in duoshowdown
---
so thats why i thought that the the range of the black hole was unfairly big
---
Not crappy.  Situational
---
He really was just wasting time.
---
I would buy it
---
Rosa comes in 7 days. You have time to farm at least more 20 mini and 2 more mega boxes.
---
Temple Ruins in beta was a nightmare, if any of you beta players do know..
---
Ikr
---
oh ok
---
Master forgive me. I'll break the seal.
---
jajaj
---
outstanding comment! have an upvote too!
---
Maybe Wednesday.
---
That's what I call, PAM FOR MAYOR!
---
Weird faces
---
Yeah, I'm DJ Kahleds son!
---
Penny’s splash can be annoying.
---
Leon one is kinda weird
---
Yea so do i
---
Mostly showdown but I don't advise to do the same
---
You're lucky the opposite team didn't have any thrower
---
Why dont you just play another brawler most of yours probably arent even 300
---
I dunno what I should type here, but here’s an upvote anyways!
---
I'm Brazilian
---
Agree, but Spike and Leon (my opinion) JUST DO NOT DESERVE TO GET A VOICE.
---
First of all, Spike. He is a cactus. A silent cute cactus that can actually murder your wife. I can't think of one voice that would fit him. And i can't even think of a dialouge for him. He is to cute to have a voice. Also sakura spike, they need two voice actors for one brawler. Good.
---
Leon, Altough i kinda see why he needs a voice. But i prefer not. He is a SILENT ASSASSIN. He kills, dissapears and then KILLS AGAIN. Making him talk kinda ruins his whole "i am a edgy mystery boy and i am actually behind you but you cant hear me!~" to "hey there mister primo i love candy" also i kinda imagined him to have a cliche voice. "I am very cool look how i caught that candy"
---
Carl's voice is annoying yes, BUT! when u said "a brawler that was released months ago" and "nobody asked for it" , i am here to give my opinions once again even tho nobody asked for it.
---
I do not see a brawler getting released recently not getting a voice. Complaining about it is just as bad as being angry over " why did crow get a buff but not leon?" Anyways, you get my point.
---
Nobody asked for Gene to have a voice. Yet it turned out.... ok tbh. I mean Supercell does not ask the fans what update should be next. Besides, future fans will be angry that Carl didn't get a voice.
---
Don't be angry at what i think, i want you to reply and tell me at what you think and maybe change my mind.
---
She’s not out yet so I would take the token doubler because it only lasts for 2 days.
---
Or you could just go piper, kill the barleys and Dynamikes than infect the map and carry your time by using your super at the last mkment
---
nice
---
Why.  is.  Leon.  White?
---
Everything off. It only happens sometimes, Like once in 20 games
---
How about making her shoot a line of flames that spreads sideways?
---
FBI OPEN UP!
---
Yea if you buy tons of gems then contact support before charge back and don't spend the gems so they know you aren't just trying to minus gems
---
But I'm done with shelly
---
Ur just salty that u don’t have night witch mortis
---
I know. Just sayin'.
---
Meh. Theres still 6666, 7777, 8888, 9999, 11111. Enough motivation to climb yet?
---
Nice Leon sculpture
---
Anyone still having this problem? I can always tell when my wifi is not turned off because of the characteristic lagging that occurs. It is intermittent in nature but i know right away
---
#FBI OPEN UP
---
M I I T H E M E
---
I like passive crows only plus I'm a really passive showdown player unless i just wanna team and ruin people's fun😈
---
I know I'm joking. I just make a joke with those guys that think if you destroys everyone with a brawler that brawler needs a nerf and when loses with a brawler that brawler needs a buff. Sorry, it wasn't so explicitly btw
---
Exactly (btw I m always using sort by newest)
---
You think my image was stupid? It was original, and I made it myself 😉
---
Lol I saw the video of them playing. That barley tho 😂
---
I agree on not being able to shoot during respawn.
---
Whats "jizz"
---
Dude stfu, teaming is unfair and you are a carl after all.
---
I'll help you shop for them good photos
---
In that you are right, but a map will never be beneficial for all fighters, there will always be a map in which one fighter is better than another.
---
and how do you say that map I designed was made especially for the fighters you mentioned.
---
Same
---
What does being carl mean here?
---
Also username checks out
---
It'S nOt An OpInIoN, tEaMiNg Is A sErIoUs PrObLeM

---
You can add her as flair
---
Do you know how
---
Just realized now thx lmao
---
Super? Question mark?
---
Leon is op lol
---
Interesting
---
It should be called bullying by stupidis
---
300 iq (Carl) vs 10 iq (everyone else)
---
EvErYtHiNg!
---
Love it
---
His super makes you move faster what does that have to do with teaming?
---
She's actually fairly easy to play on this map
---
Spinning?
---
“All tanks are trash”
---
&gt;:(
---
Ah i get it. 
---
#i got a w with four os and and s h
---
but afaik pulling her from a box will mess up your luck facor for legendaries and as someone with every brawler but them three, id rather spend 19 gems than ruin my luck factor
---
See you in hot boys
---
no its fun，ChAriTY FoR ENeMy！
---
you sound like a fool, i couldn't tell if you were gonna woooosh or not.
---
You dont need proof when ur lying!
---
Omg this is magical
