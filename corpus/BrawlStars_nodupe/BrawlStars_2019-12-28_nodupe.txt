1 month for this? A dog could do a better job in 20min

I can

Drives me nuts that this doesn‚Äôt help charge his super again. That is all.
---
Ok....
---
The first picture really irritates me
---
yes

I dont Get it *sad noises*

What could Supercell do about It?
---
Oh... I just noticed that
---
r/BrawlStars in a nutshell
---
Well, yeah, they should really buff me because Bulls and Shellys are my worst enemies besides the walls... But to say it out loud, I'm USABLE even if I don't have Star power, because in lots of cases SKILL is more important than STRENGTH. But I agree that my reload speed is trash and charging my Super for example in Solo showdown can be hard. So, I appreciate your work, hope these stats one day will become true and then I can continue to take the teamer souls.

Good night fellow creatures of night!

Ahh, the good old times when Shelly's Band aid was OP...but the showdowns were terror.
---
This looks and sounds amazing
---
Thought it was always penny but ok
---
Nope. Graveyard Shift isn't playable anymore. The game has changed.
---
Great art
---
i'm sorry then ;-;
---
When you use Carl's Super to kill teamers be like:
---

---
,,I used the spin to destroy the spin!"
---
I kinda bought Shocky...
---
Pls stop
---
THE WAR TO END ALL WARS
---
firstly it's called present plunder secondly if you can't do well in the attack then stay in your base to defend and let your teammates do the job while you are defending your team's present, brawlers like emz, spike, 8bit and jessie are great for defence
---
Amazing
---
Who cares what brawlers you do or don't have. The community as a whole loves the new mode. It's temporary, and will be gone in less than a month according to plans. Why should they change something that so many people like?
---
Make morw
---
Look i started to play in the day of global realease

i only spend money for the cyber week offer and i have 7 star power and me to 1-legendary spike

I see them as a massive upgrade in viability, and allowing me to push to 750. Which is way more fun than spending hours on getting a brawler to 500 only to be unable to push then further

Some GOOD things about this map:
---
1. It is a new map style that is less geared towards only mid range, and more towards both long and close range (LOVE IT)
---
2. The playstyles that are possible here are interesting and varied
---
3. I can see a few different team comps emerging from here that revolve around 
---
Sone things that could be tweaked:
---
1. Remove the bushes that are right next to the gem mine. It just encourages camping there
---
2. Add walls, or move the spring trap behind walls to allow for more agressive play rather than having it be as an escape option
---
3. On the set of walls that is a row of 5 then a row of 3 (Mid/bottom right), change it to be only 4 then 3. To allow for more long range
---
4. Add some more bushes to the sides with spring traps on them to allow for close range brawlers to sneak up. Also, maybe throw a wall in the bushes as well

Nita or Emz

Thanks. I hoped I wasn't the only one with this opinion. It is just so infuriating when you clearly outplay someone and have the win in the bag, but you lose because luck wasn't on your side
---
I like brawl ball since it DOESNT rotate with another event like it used to. I get most of my trophies from brawl ball so I hope this doesnt happen. I know there are other people who mostly get there trophies from brawl ball
---
It is not black background!!!

Lmao

Mike's first starpower strongly depends on skill, so if you're not good at it, I'd recommend to upgrade penny insteadüòâ

Dute dracu
---
After we exited the match, 256 trophies were added to account. Sorry for bad english.
---
Should've used Ricochet
---
still almost impossible to see the text. sorry man.
---
darryl
---
Ngl
---
dude, they difference isnt even that large, the game probably couldn't find anyone with similar trophies. Also, the game looks at similar trophies, not power levels
---
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE!!! *uninstalls the game*
---
Don't play with randoms above 800 trophies
---
not really. i have all brawlers and my legendary chance is 0.0000%
---
20 ticket bet is way more satisfying
---
Nope but I have a feeling it's going to be this weekend
---
That's the price you pay for fast matchmaking. They at least try to match you by trophies. So even if the guy is power 10 his skill level is pretty low so the randoms should be able to manage even if they're not max level.
---
They will be released soon
---
If only Trophy Doubler existed but that's OP
---
i have 16k, 28 brawlers and only 2 starpower :(
---
I noticed one of these... :( 
---
 So here take this... :D
---
Shelly was dumb and decided to invite the Frank to a 600 match
---
Posible continuation, 1: double token weekend. 2: you bought the 1,400 doubler
---
Yea
---
It's his losing animation
---
I like it :)
---
And now Tara. Craziness
---
Thats what brawl tv is for, if everythings running fine, the games perfectly normal, but if everyone on screen stops for 5 seconds and then runs faster than max, then your internet is big lag.
---
It will but their is no date when so, enjoy the Present Plumber
---
is very easy make this? What?
---
Almost 69000 on the boss.
---
**We were on the verge of greatness. We were this close.**
---
So I get bea which is a new charecter but I don‚Äôt really think bea is taht good but still
---
Also would that also mean Colt is a sheriff,Shelly is his Deputy and Poco is just there Friend that passed away but still wants to play music for all to here?
---
Thxs for the recommendation. My next brawler drawing will probably have that
---
I also got bibi a long time ago but I haven‚Äôt used it yet
---
Don't thiccify Bea
---
Bea is actually pretty good as a brawler, nice pull!
---
She decided to shut up and take lessons from Sandy Nice
---
Lol i ment stinging i wasn't paying attention
---
Yes, it is very easy. I think with Jessie it must be harder
---
Mortis looks like discount frank
---
That's the only time it's acceptable to me outside of almost entirely bush maps.
---
Oh I meant the sentence was hard to understand since there was a missing word
---
I had no clue that the community could create such a masterpiece

you can't be a furry if your main jacket is Reptilian (REPTILIAN) but Nita is a furry

Same thing happened to me except it was actually Bea :/

Scrappy is easily 1 to 2 shot by darryl
---
Just copy paste this " ‡≤†‡≤ó‡≤† " you can use any characters which system can't read.
---
Don't worry man, I love white crow to. But for the price it should offer alot more
---
And my first star power+3 shot form Jessie
---
You have No ammo I roll past scrappy and am on the attack ***your move***
---
I dont know who get this weird idea but if it was you go making the cure of cancer
---
My new reoccuring nightmare
---
ngl
---
But why do they look at trophy level? When power level is more important. It‚Äôs clearly done on purpose to get the player to spend money to upgrade your player. It‚Äôs a standard, money hungry gaming company business model.
---
I run to Scrappy
---
Oh no.
---
Oh yes. 
---
It‚Äôs happening.
---
u/repostsleuthbot
---
***over 9000*** in a few seconds because darryl
---
#Then lets try
---
definitely, but if you do a friendly match, you will have way too much fun with mortis
---
EMZ too
---
Wo wo wo
---
And showdown and graveyard shift would rotate with each other maybe
---
If you used all ammo to Jessie her Crappy kill you
---
Did you get both in the same box too?? I opened mega &amp; got pipers power ten, Bia &amp; Leon all in the same box
---
OOOF
---
I have my super by now and . . . ***roll away to live another day***
---
Take your time and post the updated version so we can see what it will look like.
---
As more characters get added, the higher the total trophies you will be able to get.
---
You completely missed the joke dumb dumb
---
YOU AGAIN?!
---
I'm pretty sure that won't work(just checked)
---
Takedown (only for colt),duo and brawl ball for jessie and penny
---
Leon with super
---
(You already made it)
---
I have no frickin idea but darryl voice comin up hot before Crow remodel and voice

In my opinion all except Elixir are extremely OP, but they are good ideas. Just needs balancing
---
The floating purple thing
---
Now that the most impressive i‚Äôve seen so far
---
Yes But actually there is three robots (Barley the bartender, Darryl the Barrel and Ricochet)
---
This should be an alt if you have both ricochet and loaded rico, maybe also add a crown and gem attack animations
---
~~  ~~ put this around your text
---
Legit
---
Got the challenge from u/MarkDelThomas (he completed it first)
---
lol
---
Cool
---
Stolen or the other guy stole it from you
---
Yeah, But For Me Graveyard Shift Was The Best Thing I ever Experienced On The Game, Adding It Back Would Make Me Play The Game 24/7 Bit Present Plunder In My Opinion Isn't That Good, I'm Not Having Fun With It And I Never Play It Unless It's To Get The Star Token, That's Just My Opinion Though :)
---
This is already a meme because Leon can‚Äôt talk it make me laugh so much
---
congrats
---
Right now I'm having around 17000 star points so if supercell adds this concept then I think I can have a huge amount of token refills. Most people might be having 10000+ star points so I think it's not a good idea to have this......
---
Well graveyard shift flopped so I dont know about it coming back
---
i think he got the worng footage
---
Make it to be bought every season
---
a lil' harsh but ok
---
This is a terrible deal. 250 tokens for a maximum of 2 boxes...
---
Lmao this is what i thought was going on untill i realised it was a template
---
Hello fellow ni-
---
Every season is a good amount but still won‚Äôt think it will be added because the max boxes you can get is 8 in a day and pros will probably have everything required to get 8 boxes so too many in one day still. Sorry
---
Leon is god Sandy is shit
---
looks very nice yet, im sure it will be awesome when its finished
---
There is one mega box per season. That‚Äôs 10 boxes in a day. This actually falls short of the mega box per season.
---
We'll have to see ;)
---
[removed]
---
Remeber the one person named I have shelly?
---
good style right here
---
U must be kidding I guess bcoz right now I'm having 17000 star points and if supercell adds this  I will completely max out my account in one day.... I can of course say that people who actually play the game have a huge amount of star points so I think this couldn't be a good idea....
---
Yeah he actually is one of the best, all the legendaries are good not that I think of it
---
Mainly hot, but cursed? I can do that sometime
---
Wassup DaPurpleDragon

---
Yes

actually works you are tho only one who can see it (im pretty sure)

Thanks it means a lot to me, I was really hyped once I got him, it took years to get him by opening mega boxes deals.
---
#"research"
---
Everyone was claiming shelly is hard to get...
---
Looking at his winrates he seems to be in a balanced position, if they buff Leon they'll have to change lone star just as they did with mortis and brawl ball.
---
Ehh i think so too
---
Calmate capo. Tomate un tecito y and√° a dormir que ya es tarde.

She's the 5th leggendary

Sorry by what do you mean by ‚Äúthis actually falls short of the mega box per season‚Äù?

~~Nerf Leon~~
---
It look like a mini cannon cart in clash royale
---
Nice name lol
---
No she's the 69th in 2069
---
~~this is quite cool~~
---
Refill tokens = 200 tokens = 2 boxes
---
Mega box = 1000 tokens = 10 boxes
---
If you feel refill tokens is too much why don‚Äôt you tell that to Supercell, tell them that the mega box is too much, and remove that mega box?
---
I hear that joke 42069 time

wait what? has my whole life been a lie?

Duo Showdown, I have friends with rank 25 brawlers but they don't play as much anymore. And my other friend that is has the highest comes at a rank 23 brawler except it's Mortis so I cant play with him because you cant queue with double brawlers. His next highest is Gene, but he refuses to play Gene with me, plus he always chooses spirit slap.
---
GG, last season I brought him to rank 25
---
It came in the brawlidays update, it's really nice
---
Now Frick
---
Nope
---
I do that, too. But you have to know just how goddamn annoying how some of them are. Especially crow, that's why Crow is my least fav brawler. If i ever get crow it would be equivalent to getting negative 500 gems.
---
Poco
---
Fck,I forgot about power play...
---
No xd
---
Im killing Bull by using crates
---
Almost all of the new showdown maps are garbage, I want the old maps back
---
What has our world become
---
This scam can no longer happen to me. Because all my 28 brawlers are maxed. I remember when I had 6 items in a mega box I was very excited but it was just medical use. I had upgraded barley to level 9 just a few days before the mega box. It was my first star power so my brother was like hEHe aT LeASt yoU hAVe a StaR PoWEr nOw.
---
I don't play both so I'm out :)
---
now,higher the xp lvl the better the offer
---
riCOLTchet
---
Already have all Brawler?
---
I missed Double Trouble, Barren Badlands, Deserted Vertex, Erratic Blocks, and Feast or Famine. Some people hate deserted vertex and I can understand, but the others were just the best maps. I was able to efficiently push my Mortis in those maps. WIth those maps gone, I will take forever to reach rank 30.

Looks like she‚Äôs calling in a new ghost brawler. Time to get a new Pam skin

The only good map along with Circular Canyon. The rest are pretty trash.

No i lituraly carried him
---
i opened 50 brawl boxes and i got bo his first starpower but yesterday i got max
---
Well... Its good and bad at the same time...
---
Good for the enemy and bad for your teammates...
---
Its becuase of the mortis I was able to get my shelly to 700
---
The mortis is a madlad
---
wrong use, they didn‚Äôt do the math, they got it from the game

Yes, but saying 275% can mean anything, saving 2.75x makes more sense

You don't watch the montage of people popping off in Gem Grab or SD,you watch them in BrawlBall.
---
This is cool.
---
First I thinks is about barley holding rico's hand being G.A.Y
---
Ok you convinced me
---
I hug mr bat
---
Thanks!
---
No
---
Perhaps that would make more sense. I am under 10k with a rank 28 Mortis and a rank 26 Bo, and comparing me to those 15k who dont even have rank 23 is an insult to me.

Mortis, bea, all legendaries except crow
---
Hmm, could replacing Jessie with a tank be just as good or close?
---
I'd say... it's a bit underwhelming, heheh. But thanks for the complement! :)
---
That Primo is getting ready to dive back in
---
Its so hard to get a legendary
---
I can know what your idiot is about
---
I mean, image spending 400$ on something you love then getting banned because someone else's fault and someone jokes about it. I don't justify his response but I understand him. And I'm not sure being rude is the reason he got banned.
---
That aint rlly special xD
---
r/cursedimages
---
Underwhelming, no, just no, that's the stupidest thing I have ever heard, its overwhelming at the minimum
---
So, no, I don't think I will upvotes to you
---
He just wants to run after his enemy. Like a true bounty hunter &gt;:)
---
needs some shading but still awesome
---
And why does it matter?
---
At least he‚Äôs cool/fun to play. Bea is like a handicapped piper
---
Some meme for Ryan
---
that's awesome
---
I have seen way too much porn to know where this is going

Bottom text

Yea, mortis is fun, but max is worse
---
Bro, you didnt invite sniper bot to the wedding, cmon man!
---
If it doesn't crash, in brawl ball you are IN the corner and take and heal a lot of damage and then crash.
---
Lol a giant robot that is damaged would not like gene
---
the pull caused him to touch tick's mine
---
&gt;Mortis
---
&gt;change reload speed from 2,4 -&gt; 2,3 seconds
---
No. Mortis doesnt need a reload buff. All he needs is a damage buff 1260 -&gt; 1500 so he can 3hit kill more brawlers. Mortis only needs a damage buff.
---
Hell no , he will shoot me and I will be dead.
---
....okay.
---
bea: **harder** 
---
rosa: what?!
---
bea: fight harder
---
rosa: oh, thats weird, you made it weird bea
---
I opened 4 boxes, 1 big, and got max after 3 months of not getting any brawlers
---
But gongratulation
---
1: He's trolling
---
2: He might have misclicked 
---
3: stop playing with randoms if you dont like this to happen
---
Takedown, huh?
---
???
---
Yes, I do regret not shading them, heheh, I'll try revisiting this one in the future, maybe after I've done the Epics
---
I am the Senate...
---
Are lazy leons like tiny desk engineers?
---
#KINDA
---
Awww... well, I was referring to shading, but anyways Thanks!
---
Bea X Minecart
---
But you see that gets you mob downvoted
---
I have never done this but I reckon this could be a good idea, even if it has been suggested at least 50 times before this
---
.. ._.
---
No it doesn't
---
I'm the Rosa.
---
r/emojipolice put your hands in the air
---
ooh and every time he reloads its the bell and carriage return sound
---
u posted this 4 times
---
Looks like the last team grabbed more than they could handle
---
This template would be better if shelly said something then they responded
---
Oh hell no. I'm too young to go to jail.
---
yes!
---
It's reddit there is no jail just negative karma

A piper in brawl ball or gift steal should get punched in the face

I see no grown up saying ‚Äú you are jealous because you don‚Äôt have him‚Äù and if you really are an adult, which I highly doubt, what‚Äôs wrong with u
---
perhaps
---
tara have a pro name you good
---
Bruce has a lot more HP than Tara's shadow,and if you have Hyper Bear he can kill the shadow in 1.5 seconds
---
It's been 1 week since the update is live.
---
thanks
---
:)
---
Go ahead, no one is stopping you, except yourself
---
I think it‚Äôs ‚Äúabout this‚Äù?
---
Well if Gene wants to marry a giant robot that kills everyone who are we to judge lol
---
r/barleygang my friend
---
Nah someone reached 30K
---
But Tara's shadow is much faster, I think a little nerf in Hyper Bear would be nice, what do you think?
---
Ok I‚Äôll join that
---
Yea I got 1400 doubler from Christmas did the robo rumble and then bought the other 1400 doubler deal im still set

I remember posting a picture of unlocking dynamike last year when this sub had like 4k subs and the first comment was Who cares? and the second was time to spin

---
Ummm what
---
Why Bibi...
---
She cant even crush walls .__.
---
wtf
---
He is out tho?
---
rrly...
---
damn that is epic
---
Maybe,a little buff in Bruce's speed and a nerf in Nita's reload speed would be nice,and maybe a buff in Bear With Me to make both SP in the same use rate you know?
---
No need to be a douche, it's a decent play. Let him have it
---
Hello fellow Singaporean
---
What happened to the sniper? lol
---
What the hell happened here

Oh you poor thing. Didn't you at least link a Supercell account?

Added. Got some time here and there to deal with the tickets

Chillll

Yes.

the IDs for brawlers‚Äô portrait must‚Äôve messed up, probably from starting another match, leaving, then joining another match.
---
Ja toch üá≥üá±

Get gud
---
ok?
---
Congrats!
---
OK.
---
Modding, which is against supercell terms and conditions I think.
---
Why did u post the same thing but say it's a big box
---
Tara just missed her super now GO HUG'ER
---
M a x i n e
---
if it makes you happier, i deleted the post B(
---
What do you expect from a person who puts ttv in their name
---
I think you should delete this post ASAP before any mods see this..
---
Pam might be mooshroom for me.
---
Not upvoting. Shouldn‚Äôt beg for it
---
When i came back to the game I got bea on day one and same with max!

You cant get to 13 minutes anymore. You could only do it using glitches which have been fixed.

Fun fact: the current acid lake map is actually an old takedown map.

Well thats on a normal day. Token doublers plus doubler weekend is actually a maximum of 8 boxes.
---
DOWNVOTE. DOWNVOTE NOW.
---
Just close the servers if this is the best you idiots can do.
---
No one likes them
---
Why u gotta be so negative
---
would night witch mortis also be acceptable?
---
Well he tried so... No need to bully this guy! And if u try (the bullies) u could fail too!
---
And also don‚Äôt deny it
---
I hugged him for the third time
---
Does that mean I hugged him thrice?
---
He deserves it anyways he's the cute brawl stars cactus
---
That's how it's called in Italian and I think that it's actually a better name since you tal tell her gender
---
 You can make real ones
---
Play with Shellys all day long, after being killed for 27th time on a row by low effort Shelly you never want to see them again
---
THOMAS THE DEATH STAR

Sorry but the link isnt done yet...... You have to wait
---
Well fix Shelly‚Äôs stupid super and sniper range shotgun then
---
It's good but pls stop using emotes on reddit.
---
OG experience, I'm talking about
---
Okay
---
Bought for 349 gems :)
---
Just said small chances bro, don't be so mad
---
So you‚Äôre telling me you somehow got another person‚Äôs emote ideas without knowing that they made it.
---
My first nick was "Asexky" i made it for fun
---
Everybody seems to forget popcorn rico
---
Ur name is brawler999 XD
---
Loaded Rico here and I am conflicted
---
Ur garbo at the game
---
OMG!
---
I  N E E D  I T
---
So cuteüòç
---
Totally agree! Doesn't make a difference, just score the moment you get the chance, and don't something potentially stupid, like the example above
---
No she doesn't
---
Golly! This is very good! üòç
---
Holy crap that‚Äôs hilarious we need more of this. It reminds me of the birds and the crow is like ‚Äúyou wan sum fuk?‚Äù
---
LOL!! (baby Yoda Spike)
---
One of them isn't like the others
---
Well it‚Äòs not that bad, i mean i just need to open boxes for some pp for max, but i don‚Äòt really care, i mean she isn‚Äòt one of my favourite brawlers, so i wont play her that often, i just played her to get her to 550 and now i wont really play with her anymore. 
---
Also i have over 450 tickets more, so if i really would need boxes, i would just play with people from my club (even if i never played in a team with other people, i mean i know they all are good, but i just think i wont be good enough to play with them)
---
Go to r/memes and use the original template. This is a video game subreddit, not a meme subreddit.
---
It happens when u click exit and INSTANTLY press play
---
F for poor Leon:(
---
The minute you underestimate your opponent. You've truly lost the fight
---
The shooter bot got rejected
---
for my luck i always get newly released brawlers 1 month after their release... the only exceptions were rosa and carl got them a week after their release
---
Seems like reddit doesn‚Äôt like 8-bit gang lmao
---
I did this just for fun and this got almost 200 upvotes. Thank you so much for the support, I am really surprised!
---
Name your self other game
---
look i dont want this to get serious but im just telling u that i did not know someone did this so when supercell did add the smiley frown etc i was thinking they should make the emote they allredy had in another app to add them in game and i photo shopped this .
---
??
---
This happens after the screen is split or when the battery saver mode is on
---
Italiano ?
---
Post it on r/brawlmaps
---
True
---
Wow...
---
I didnt know that Darryl is that short!
---
Lmao tick a sleeper pick
---
It looks great ¬∞ v ¬∞
---
XDDDDD
---
But I'm too lazy to check, so
---
Hey. What about your dad mike?
---
Used up 3.6k token doubles on robo rumble but hey, I‚Äôve maxed out my account except for sandy,max and bea I got on consecutive days last weeks‚Äô star powers
---
Because it's not even a strategy. It's only purpose is to annoy people. People kill other players just for the sake of doing it. When somebody starts attacking you, you've already used all of your ammo on the boss. It's just pointless.
---
Sooo true
---
Darryl are OP in this meta but I still don't like him
---
(17 thousands trophies boy)
---
This is the best art I've seen till now. It looks AWESOME!!!!!
---
Danm bro I always hate that even though I already had a high  percentage like 2 months ago and I been buying a lot of mega boxes and not a single brawler come out but this day I finally got leon.
---
Shut up üôÑ

Removed.

Rule 5. Repetitive or low effort posts with a low discussion potential will be removed.

Power play too

What is that

The ideas are weird

(Specially Poco and Mortis)

They don't need a buff.

but i didn't showed in my profile tho

well... i think that my reddit app is very bugged

Pp make white pee

You pay brawlstars through your Apple ID payment method: it can be Apple pay, Apple card, your own debit card, or gift card credit
---
I'll remove the old one, i remade it because i thought i had lost it
---
nita

when you start a match and see the WiFi sign:

Aparently, a screenshot can get you 1.6k upvotes

Oh snap I totally missed thatüòÇ Thanks for the help

Looks like she is gonna eat him
---
Its a template but that's a swell idea

LOL

I got my first at 200 lol now I have 17k
---
Why are you so mean for no reason?
---
mine is 6:05 with nita
---
You died
---
not. ok.
---
I agree btw what happened
---
wdym what happened
---
Very Nice Sandy
---
you forgot bots in brawl stars friendly games
---
You make me sick. Are you the one that goes into Brawl Ball and scores own goals?
---
Why r u gone from the second thingy
---
still its not the same value as a mega box. And its once per day so it will take long
---
i also mean those bots
---
still missing leon and sandy, also max and bea
---
dunno
---
Mortis definitely needs a buff. He‚Äôs been useless in the game since they removed auto-aim. He‚Äôs still usable, but there‚Äôs always a better option. There‚Äôs basically only three brawlers he can fight. Plus a brawler doesn‚Äôt desperately need a buff before it happens. It‚Äôs about making brawlers viable. Rosa was pretty good before they buffed her wasn‚Äôt she? And Darryl was in Mortis‚Äô situation where there‚Äôs ALWAYS a better option. Now Darryl and Rosa are the two best brawlers. And about the Poco buff... Poco‚Äôs only purpose is to support tanks, and that‚Äôs ridiculous. Plus Da Capo is broken with a double tank comp, and the tank meta has been around for two months, it‚Äôs time for a change. And the Poco buff I proposed isn‚Äôt intended to make him OP, at the end of the day, it‚Äôs still going to take him 5 shot to kill most brawlers. I just wanted to make his damage less laughable.
---
Judging from this post you're not mentally stable enough to spend money. Wait until you're older
---
Yeah all those other brawlers in there are not hot,not hot, not hot
---
300 IQ
---
the powercubes have won :b
---
No because the art is good but it's too fucking creepy
---
Forget this thread.

same but leon instead of crow

I have a small youtube channel but I onlybuse it to share these videos with my friends
---
Sometimes ignorance cannot be remedied.  then in catch you moan as I kill her if they are behind a wall with 10 gems which the characters in range cannot make and also load.  others recharge faster than bull or darryl, and adding the distance is impossible not to feed or pass it even if you want.  so please say stupidities go elsewhere.
---
Brawl team said they won't make third sp now, and that carl's third sp is on bs hacked mod
---
Me too, I thought the whole point of the map was to get hunted, run away, or rule the game; its even in the name, feast or famine
---
Depended a lot on luck
---
Nioce
---
well thats fine I just wanted to say that i loved the video. also whats the channel i would subscribe to watch some ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
that does not break the fact that any brawler that this Serca of her is charged with shooting crazy
---
Awwww sweeetie
---
6 √ó 200 = 1200 = 12 boxes wdym
---
Use what?
---
Only 2 maps.
---
Now idk if my art is trash or not sooooo.....
---
Yup, that‚Äôs the new start. Got just over 7 with this comp and my buddies. Star powers help a lot too
---
Nope, I think only every other one tilts. It's pretty much an event modifier, I have no idea why they didn't put a little icon saying the tilt is on, like it does for modifiers in showdown
---
Alright I‚Äôll try to put things in order here
---
u/SomeDudeWhoDidStuff you shouldn‚Äôt try to justify someone‚Äôs point by just saying ‚Äúyou are not an expert‚Äù. Instead say what you already did in your next paragraph, that explains enough about what u/koochywalla did wrong
---
And about this one, saying ‚Äúthat‚Äôs bullshit because it doesn‚Äôt make sense‚Äù is not a point, not because is negative, but because is destructive. As the guy who did that post, I‚Äôd love to hear what makes you think that, so I can learn from my errors, but this just doesn‚Äôt help

Thanks for your support! The channel name is "HappySeal" but im not interested in subscribers. I just made it for fun. And many other videos I made are not that good
---
Well, please post this thing in r/BrawlstarsCompetitive ..
---
Most subs in that subreddit are higher rank and trophies than me.. I want to see what their opinion about this thing :)
---
That is my intention, I already had negative gems because supercel is dumb, so might as wel go more negative cause I will never buy anything again from braw stars
---
Wait, wot ?!?!?
---
Serious-f*ckin-ly ?
---
Sorry for you, my boy, and good luck...

How do you find this?

My highest was 6:49 with Pam, Jessie, 8-Bit

Sandy is too lazy to be sleepy.

But the meme starts saying it was Solo Showdown
