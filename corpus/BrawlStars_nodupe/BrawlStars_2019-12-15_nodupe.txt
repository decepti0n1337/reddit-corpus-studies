Yes, sorry for 3 post of this map
---
---
---
I like your idea and I barely post anything on Reddit so how do you get that poco icon next your username
---
are you from poland
---
Penny
---
yep
---
Colt would be *_broken_* on 1 vs 3
---
Nope
---
Sniper isn’t a team
---
*Darryl prepares to send Penny to the Shadow Realm by sneaking a Blue-Eyes White Dragon into his Pokémon deck*
---
It's written on top
---
XD That made my day
---
#yall be on global release im in alpha#

What happened?

---
Colt's Star power would be too OP for Bossfight

I will travel across the land

Some people are easily offended

---
N I G G E R
---
Could be nothing at all, this is an art after all.
---
Pirate theme
---
Yeah, looking back I would make it replenish only 0.5 of an ammo bar and make it not work on the boss
---
Nothing is confirmed, the snow theme could might as well come back
---
Me
---
oh my really ? he is at rank 20 for me and i have never noticed .-. talk about being blind
---
Well, if you go off of length, Jessie has like waist length hair (18-20 in)
---
This Is something I'll never forget, thanks
---
That a snack
---
your welcome XD
---
Wow, good job!
---
yeah
---
Always satisfying to see those trophies
---
So they add that little space for nothing?
---
Me: what am i supposed to do with BOX
---
Tee hee, typically it’s in the title.
---
Say, while you’re here, have you noticed that there are two posts identical to this one, posted by the same guy around the same time?
---
Bibi crow poco and every one that doubles things are op
---
They all know
---
Umm he just likes to draw skins each day
---
It doesnt matter if its his original idea or not
---
Yeah, not the first time I see something like this
---
i just realised pirate poco plays music with a broom lol
---
I miss him :(
---
You know what? I was thinking in take your advice and stop doing it because you are the first person who say that Im a good artist, but then I saw that you are not the owner of this post, and I'm thinking again 👉👈💔
---
Then give credit
---
Not really, he just used the video clip for a meme, he's not disrespecting etika any way.

There is a new box it has a damn eye patch and they purposely put a space in between the boxes and the game mode chooser thingy so yeah
---
Yea I dont get what you're saying at all. I didnt ask for sad upvotes, I didnt put him in the title, and I only used him because his reaction was literally a meme that went perfectly for this. I thought of this meme because of the reaction, not "oh I can make a meme with etika in it so I can get useless internet points"
---
#time for trouble#
---
Barley: Keep talking...
---
I don't want to be forced to spend star points on a brawler. A mega box is 1500 star points and it's pretty much a mandatory purchase if you're missing star powers, brawlers, power points and gold. 
---
I'd rather they slightly improved the chances of receiving brawlers and perhaps increase the chances of receiving star powers from 1% to 2%. With the addition of power play, adding new brawlers almost every month and doubling the amount of star powers in the game, it's time to improve the box odds. 
---
As for the boss fight mode, it would never happen since the mode would be too easy. People want a Nerf for the mode but removing the robots is too drastic.

8-Bit is mainly different shades of grey, I tried recreating that but it didn’t turn out very well. So now it looks like I abused my grey pencil.
---
I love you all!! I want to hug all of you but you know, I'm a cactus ;( Thanks for drawing me kind artist!!
---
#*HI*
---
YEP!
---
I could seriously fucking solo the boss as Nita as long as I had a healer that had more than half a brain cell.
---
Because I literally already did several times. And no I'm not using an emulator.
---
Yeah
---
I was going to make a fifty shades of grey joke, but I don't know any.
---
Oof I don’t either
---
Alrighty then, guess u can just go on about ur day. I wish ya the best of luck!
---
Wow such low quality
---
With the speed she swings with it could be a cyborg arm covered with fake skin
---
&lt;3
---
You should really stop reposting this
---
Yeah no. You didnt inspire them. It is a common idea and theme. You took the ideas of a pirate from the original sources so I wouldn't be talking.
---
I feel like OP's tone in the title is more of excitement in that supercell have accepted his skin? Idk, just imo
---
I actually really like this map, just remove the one block tiles
---
lol you motherfucker

Best potato shigechi

Other comment of this??? Go and see what i answered to the other one that said that

Lmao i posted the same thing when bibi first came out. I got a lot fewer upvotes though :(
---
Your post has been removed, make sure to use the body of a post to elaborate on the title.

confirmed by scl?

r/uselessyellowcircle

Yes and also Darryls info says he,
---
Ps all robot brawlers are male
---
That's so much
---
First is Carl not Karl
---
Second you haven’t seen the hog rider skin?
---
I know, but the color of the bandana is the same and  I also wanted to go with the flow
---
0.07 *sadness*
---
I guess Supercell is going to have to put in a number of requirements for queuing with friends to prevent this from happening.
---
Here are my only ideas
---
.You can't play 3v3 gamemodes if you only have 1 friend in the game room
---
.You and your friend(s) have to be using brawlers that have similar trophy counts and power levels so matches can be fairly balanced
---
EDIT: Nevermind, this is a horrible idea.
---
all robots are male
---
~ laughs in bakesale barley *
---
this post is reportable
---
Bibi gives you the most enjoyment her core mechanics are just really fun.
---
When we play friendlies or in a team comp my friend (usually the host) bans us from playing Bibi so that he can. But I have some fun with Emz instead.
---

---
I’m 12 and this is funny
---
Wow dats amazing how many legendaries do u have i only have 1
---
If stolen send me the link of real post.
---
And? You need no skill to get that high still shit player lmao
---
Unless girls can have mustaches
---
That person had 4 high-trophy brawlers, also matching people with the same amount of trophies in total and per brawler would completely destroy the game
---
Imo, they’re both pretty good. Slick boots is always nice to have after it’s buff a couple months back, and magnum special can make your attacks harder to dodge from an enemy’s stance.
---
He jumped off a bridge, it was suicide. I heard a while ago he was talking to his viewers about not doing it, and how you can make it through whatever you are doing. Rlly miss him
---
Depends in the way you use colt, the movement speed is good to aim and evade bullets but the Magnum Special is really good too
---
:Rise of the Ant
---
It really depends. Slick boots can be better overall to some people due to the potential to be able to avoid being hit, and potential to get in position faster to connect a hit on someone.
---
Showdown, brawl ball for sure slick boots. Gem grab maybe magnum special. Takedown/lone star slick boots.
---
The extra speed is a constant thing, and very helpful even though it’s only 10%.
---
Supercell has done a good job balancing out all the star powers where each brawler can benefit from either brawlers star power.
---
The matchmaking is based on individual brawler's trophies, not on the entire total trophies. Stop fussing so much when you don't even know how the game works
---
From what I know, Barley can too.
---
😂👌
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)  *T A S T Y*
---
Wow that's a lot. But the reason it would also not be fair to match up based on just total trophies would include things we have to consider like levels and individual brawler strategies. If the totals are the same, then that would mean that it is possible for a 70 trophies, power 1 brawler to be teamed up with a 600 trophies, power 10 brawler. The system would end up getting a lot more broken than it is now. Even if you are the same total trophies as someone, maybe they won't know how to use a brawler in a strategic way. For example, an 11k total trophies person will match up with another 11k total trophies person who just unlocked Crow and doesn't play with Crow wisely. While I admit that this system can lead to problems, I believe it would be a lot worse if total trophies were taken into consideration
---
Haha! I mean, you don't have to believe me, but there's not a reason to lie about it.
---
If I get access to the Brawl Talk before I expect it and I want to do a speculation video, I record the speculation video before I watch the Brawl Talk.
---
Doing anything else would just be deceitful &amp; that's not my style
---
In korea the brawl talk must be at 5:30 p.m.
---
You are being too nitpicky, you clearly know he is referring to tokens.
---
I’m hoping that it’ll be the final trophy road brawler
---

yEaH!

Does it normally release at 1 am?

Depends on your time zone. Could be 12 because of Daylight Savings, but it normally releases (I want to say) 11AM Helsinki time

r/BrawlStarsClips
---
We will see about that tomorrow
---
I thought there wasn't going to be a new brawler on this update
---
I guess it was just for us to don't missclick boxes
---
I found a way to purposefully do this on my phone and being in a match is very wierd
---
Some information of the update: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ
---
Not being rude but I have to tell you, that emojis are hated to be used in Reddit. You'll probably get downvoted to oblivion if you use them.
---
Me when using crow and getting kills stolen before the last poison tick

---
Sorry to hear that, hope he gets better!
---
Dont worry! God loves you!
---
Great!! Maybe “Parrot Bo”
---
Okay sir
---
I admit I made a repost. 
---
So, you made a huge fuss about a fucking repost which got almost nil upvotes. That too when I was not well-accustomed with the reddiquette. I am sorry bout that but you should haven't stalked my entire profile.
---
This is amazing, keep it up!
---
Ok so here me out, El primo is getting a buff. This is because Darryl is most likely using Primos card to cheat in the game they are playing. Why would Darryl break the rules with a bad card? If he if using El Primos card to cheat, it must mean that El Primo is good now.
---
F
---
Pretty sure what actually happened was that Darryl activated Penny’s trap card.
---
/s?
---
Happy cake day
---
I somehow have more legendary brawlers than mystic
---
I’m confused as hell right now
---
r/brokethechain

true but by the brawltalk part sometimes

No lol horrible idea

I would like to see Ricochet make a reappearance with the bots in boss fight or Robo rumble
---
Blursed
---
Nice job I didn't know there was a brawl Star Comics learn something new on Reddit everyday
---
That's the only skin I would use real credits to buy.
---
But It wouldn't look the same even if it was implemented into the game.
---
Pokemon X Y meme
---
how us maxed out?
---
Every star power
---
Sure thing!
---
He probably looked at the r/shittybrawlstars subreddit and made a horrible jump into the enemy base with 10 gems post but that's what I think what he does 😅
---
I never said all this stuff men,how old are you ?,8 ?
---
Yes, I got my Gene at 10k
---
Now start to push kiddo
---
I don’t want to fell dumb but is bs bullshit or brawl stars
---
He still deserves it
---
No, I'm not exited
---
repost
---
But it isn' t well deserved on 3k. Above 10k, It' s okay if you have.
---
That s mean you dont have brawl stars this summer that was 30000 years this is like 30 years

I have 13.500 trophies, we going try

Idk. In my country it’s 2am soooo... I write with no sense. But when Sandy came out, Kairos ate sand until he got Sandy.

Says the one who tried to fake everyone into thinking the game was dying when he knew all along global was coming, just to build hype.

Nothin but love anyway though. 😆

it is a big box with pig nostrils.

Wow, first time i heard a joke aboit randoms. It's not like i saw posts like these a 1000 times. Very OC

|As the month of christmas rolls around towards the world of brawl stars, everyone has decided to go to a christmas party to give presents, eat food and have a good time. However, sandy has decided to not join, as he thinks christmas is not important.|
---
II:
---
|Since it can't snow in the desert and he likes the cozy coldness of winter, sandy has decided to go to a hotel, and when he was about to go to sleep, a candle suddenly went ablaze and the ghost of christmas past appeared. She flew sandy back in time to show him his childhood, where he, his parents and his friends were having fun together in christmas and asked him what happened. Sandy just replied with "i guess i got too old for christmas" and told her to get out.|
---
III:
---
|When sandy was about to go to sleep the second time, then suddenly, a fire place and couch appeared out of nowhere and there appeared the ghost of christmas present. "How about we have a feast sandy?" and as soon as he said that, a buffet appeared from the fireplace and he began to tell sandy that he should be having fun, sandy declined, and the ghost picked him up and sent him towards the party that he ignored. The ghost showed him all the great things that is happening in the party. "I don't care about this" sandy said, "deep down, you do" the ghost replied. Annoyed, sandy once again told him to get out.|
---
VI:
---
|When sandy was about to sleep the 3rd time, he felt an unnerving feeling, he looked around and saw the ghost of christmas future right next to him. The ghost then sent him to the desert in the future, however the area looks empty. "Sandy, you have friends, and why would you waste the oppurtunity to meet and have fun with all of them just to be lazy?" The ghost said, then he pointed him towards a grave, not in a pyramid nor with a gravestone, just a simple plot of land. The ghost undug it and sandy saw himself, he realised that if he continues ignoring his friends, he would be forever alone. Sandy began to beg the ghost to bring him back.|
---
V:
---
|As soon as he came back, sandy joined his friends. And tommorow, he began to go out more and decided to hang out with everyone else, even when it wasn't christmas (though he still has trouble going outside to do this, he still did the effort to do so.).|

Has your account been connected to Supercell ID?
---
- Look for messages in your inbox that mention Supercell ID. This will help you figure out which email address you used to register.
---
- As soon as this address becomes known, open the game’s settings, click on the “Disabled” button next to the Supercell ID and log in to your account.
---
If the lost game was tied to a Google Play account (Android only. Previously, logging in via Google):

That's such a nice detail

Reminds me the tara/pam's update, and you can find some informations about the news brawlers here, but it's not specific : [https://www.reddit.com/r/brawlstarsmodding/comments/e3bsex/datamine\_november\_update\_datamine/](https://www.reddit.com/r/brawlstarsmodding/comments/e3bsex/datamine_november_update_datamine/)
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
"**NEW BRAWLERS**
---
As I said in my previous datamine, there are two unreleased Brawlers in the game files, BeeSniper and SpawnerDude, which still have default Shelly stats. Furthermore to that, there are **TWO** new Brawlers on top of that added in this update! That means there are currently **FOUR** disabled Brawlers in the files. Frank did say that there would be big things happening for the 1st Anniversary which is December 12th, so perhaps we are getting upto **FOUR BRAWLERS**, which would be insane. The two new Brawlers added in this update are called Speedy and Homer. There is also something called ReloadBooster which I presume will act similarly to 8-Bit's Damage Booster."
---
Who's that vsco girl again?
---
I don't see any mods post saying your post has been removed from this subreddit. It's still visible. I think it just wasn't upvoted.
---
Also, one will probably be a Mythic, since there are only 3 Mythics currently, and there are 4 Legendaries, Rares, Super Rares and Epics.
---
Yeah they just announce everything that’s going to happen in the next update
---
Скрин не для реддита
---
oh
---
so...I played untill rosa came out,then i stopped for yhe entire summer,and at september i started playing again.
---
from 3800 - 3900  to 10k trophies
---
Wouldnt work on el primo
---
i dont have either
---
if you’d unsubscribe because he wouldn’t do it then you’re a fake fan

Did they changed the chance of 1 percent?!

there are two new so yea

Good way or bad way, still creative

I also had it.

If you are really unlucky you get it.

When was the last time you unlocked a new brawler?

Nahhh dude. its obviously a solid

*bring out the two hundred thousands GOD mode mouse bots*

Six weeks ago... I‘m not sure...

No but having all kind of rarity brawlers increase the chance of star powers

How dare you, Crow, Tara and Pam are carolina reapers!
---
What is name of this power rangers? It was used to be my favourite.
---
Good map but there are 1 tile gaps (hard to navigate)
---
I dunno, Max seems to be out of nowhere brawler. I would want to have another pirate related brawler then new themed one.
---
Nah, she seems like a worse Leon. The only thing about Max that I'd consider op is giving speed to 8bit and Rosa. I also wonder would her super make Mortis, Crow, and Leon even faster?!? If so then yea in the way she's gonna be op.
---
omae wa mou shindeiru
---
i think this update was quite small and i dont care about which brawler i would like
---
I think Max is from a gang with El Primo.
---
My reasons:
---
- El Primo have a very Superhero look same as Max
---
- They have an ‘’special’’ food who represents them El Primo-Jalapeño and Max-EnergyDrink
---
The only thing similar is the super which isnt even that unique of an idea. Stop trying to give people random credit
---
But what about Kairos, lex, cory and my fav Rey?
---
More space for boxes now!
---
Yep, but Bea will be annoying too when in pro player hands, because of how wide she have her attack so she will hit target easily.
---
:(
---
Mortis eating my kind since 1996
---
that’s hot
---
Nope.. I feel more younger than before XD
---
Still
---
Yikes
---
_loses 4 trophies_
---
_complains_
---
temporal
---
It's temporary
---
Same, but I think that is a coincidence
---
You guys the brawl talk was the worst yet.... yall are introducing new skins with no animation to go with the new skins to make them special.....then once again remaking the same characters slightly better than the last just to nerf the new ones in the next updates like most previous new brawlers and buff the old ones because the old ones are obviously not as good as the new
---
P.s   the two new brawlers are clearly new age brawlers not pirate age bralwers??? Why
---
Idk EMZ and 88-bit are pretty dope and fits in.
---
This is just the same darryl
---
The youtubers don’t know the rarities either
---
I feel slightly the same about 1 brawler. That brawler is Max. Althought I do think these brawlers just need some time to get used to the way the brawler looks. Just like how I felt with Carl. But it makes sense that Bea helps out Rosa. Max just feels out of place. Robots, The Leather Jacket Gang(bibi, crow, bull), Red heads(colt, jessie, pam), Sibling Duo(nita and leon), throwers, the mortuary gang (emz, frank, mortis, poco), pirates, the sand family (tara, gene, sandy), and just ethnic brawlers(primo, bo, piper, brock) , and now plant lovers (spike, rosa, bea). But Max is just...on caffeine. Waiting for caffeine withdrawal.
---
Bruh r/woooosh
---
Yea sure they don't...
---
They actually dont lol
---
I hope she's super rare and max's mythic
---
Isn’t Bea a sniper?
---
What rarity they are?
---
Relaxing most likely. Going in while being stressed isn’t going to help
---
That’s his guess lol
---
"Bitbit"
---
Bruh
---
Similaritation on point
---
they should add a new space from events and get there to permanent events, only playable in weekends same as ticketed events, but here we could have Life Leech (halloween) and this new game mode
---
R.I.P
---
What's wrong with it?
---
Um... Ok :I
---
Coke Darryl
---
Bea is a mythic I gues beesniper is another brawler,probably a brother/sister to bea
---
They look like pixar characters...
---
Keep telling yourself that buddy.
---
Oh ok
---
How to do it?
---
i don’t remember a place with a superhero temathic
---
Wow you really have to have more trust in life
---
All people got lagged at the same time, Youtube crashed because there were like 500.000 people watching the Brawl Talk at the same time.
---
That... wasn't a Power Cube...
---
This is a Photoshop from Lex according to his opinion, not the official rarities.
---
She is a mythic
---
What in the world did i just read
---
Wow creepy
---
I think they should make a game mode with ten people and they all have to try and kill each other to win and there are these little cubes that give your brawler a buff.
---
&gt;crow (shitty hitpoints and attack,
---
&gt;Mortis is crap but fast
---
It's you who I don't know how to play
---
This isn’t official the rarities are speculation
---
Bea is mythic and max is epic
---
They have early acces and that's a fact, its not a matter of trusting people but knowing facts.
---
For max cara should drink petrol
---
Matchmaking
---
It's a discussion thread about the new brawlers, opinions and critics are more than welcome.
---
They said they didn’t know
---
Cool comics !
---
shut up i love max
---
Say wha...? 500k?
---
So? It’s 4 fucking trophies and Emz isn’t even all that good
---
2 Emz?
---
No he was a pool bot
---
its when you autoaim in the front of a wall
---
And it must be true if they said so yes? Well no, they obviously can't say they do and even if they could they wouldn't because they make a living from those videos.
---
The past year was filtred brawlers called ‘’Shield’’ later called Rosa, ‘’Boomerang’’ lated called Carl and ‘’Hook’’ lated called Gene. So isn’t that crazy that in the next months we’ll have that brawlers with something releated to the name in gfiles

#Darryl trust in the heart of the cards
---
In braw ball she’s insane at high level for map control, especially in today’s map. Play her with frank and colt and it’s great.
---
Max with super: exist
---
Crow with robo retreat: ARE YOU CHALLENGING ME?
---
They could’ve said Brawl Stars isn’t letting them release the sneak peeks yet, and you are doubting that they are telling the truth, which is TRUST related
---
/rwooosh
---
You are a fucking repost kid
---
And tick "ClusterBomb" i think
---
r/woooosh
---
Yeah,when I was watching it,there were 500.000 people.
---
I am not seeing many youtubers mentioning this so made this post ._.
---
And then It crashed because of that
---
\*my randoms team everytime
---
It is not trust related, besides why would I trust them if I don't like them one bit?
---
Don’t laugh of him, is too cute :(
---
They both look like fooking pixar characters
---
Ahoj
---
What channel?
---
I will upload link to google drive here to the video with different account , stay tuned
---
no its actually funny. things like this are fun sometimes
---
#savetheparrot
---
I only have this screenshot :(
---
Here before this blows up.
---
bea-epic
---
max-mythic
---
Photoshopped
---
Oh i see, makes sense. So this is not like a fault on supercell's end or something. Thanks!
---
Me too pls😍
---
Dang
---
You did Bea very well, except.... Max...
---
So, Lex is right?
---
Yes, i know, it’s a screenshot and low-effort post, but it’s all about the love and funniness put into the post and not the design.
---
Share drive link
---
Its fake
---
SHES NOT

Shes not

reconcept: Nasty Piper
---
Idk i didnt watched his video
---
Ok, my 7490 RUB is go to Pirate Darryl
---
Wow !
---
Or force the player to play Solo showdown in a set amount of time.
---
Lmao I was laggin that time too
---
I hope for you! Me I just don't have sandy and that's all and the two news ahaha
---
RIP my legendary chances
---
how to be a brawler here??
---
I agree with you, but waayyyy in the beginning of brawl stars, before the beta, it was supposed to be a futuristic space-themed game. Chances are they'll be giving us a space themed update within the next year.
---
DC characters with a marvel format 100000% confusion
---
Ya like jazz?
---
Bea looks like a beaver
---
Skin too beautiful, I'll steal my parents' credit card to buy gems and buy this skin
---
Amazing idea bro.
---
Subreddit settings-change user flair
---
We have a confirmed new box?!
---
They never said pirate box it was just a part of animation
---
ty
---
They said Bea is Rosa's assistant and Kairos is guessing 8-Bit might have somethig to do with Max
---
You‘re only at 12.5k, be happy you had all epics and mythics in the first place...
---
God, wish they make one pirate skin for Darryl
---
Te-as injura de toti mortii dar macar esti in pewdiepiesubmissions
---
I beg to differ. The fact that OP had the idea to make a joke like this, which I don't think anyone in good faith could've predicted, does show that the post is indeed ingenious. Maybe I'm just speaking for myself, but I wouldn't put this on the same level as the "trash" you're mentioning. It's a lighthearted joke and it pointed out something that we might or might not have had in mind in a way which I personally find funny.
---
Even brawl talk lags as heck
---
Supercell are you going to do something with servers? They are total shit
---
Pam doesn't have a skin because she is on the list of brawlers that need a remodel
---
No one:
---
My legendary drop rate:

---
Hmm yes , the floor here is made out of floor
---
In truth this is true dyna is already a good brawler just high skill cap just to flex I pushed my mike 100 trophies to 500 yesterday in just 25 min with my friend (I’m 12k and my friend is 6.4k he used poco at 180)
---
When you don't get remodel and voice in the update, that's almost about you:
---
**the snow is snowier**
---
It's deleted cuz supercell doesnt allow to post dev build info without permission
---
Rarity?
---
LADYBUG BEA
---
or you can give that link on your Twitter or something becuz brawl stars can delete that maybe
---
Never in my life would I have expected someone to post something about Mario Party 10 on Reddit.
---
I really enjoyed that game, despite all the hate it got.
---
 e p i c
---
You were right, the brawl talk confirmed it :) Nice eye there
---
The clashers, but the video is private
---
Dude I beg u send it to me too ur a ledgend
---
Rly?
---
He never said that.
---
Epic and mythic
---
Leon is more high skill brawler then it seems
---
It really do be like that sometimes
---
It’s the Normal Darryl 🥴
---
Wow! Cool!
---
👍🏻
---
Just wait
---
What can i say expect : bye legendary percentual (i dont know if it Is correct :)  )
---
1.15 buzzy bees!
---
For u or?
---
Epic indeed
---
Stop acting oh so mature because you don't like a popular joke lmao
---
bumble-bea
---
Also finally someone that knows that brock is hight skill cap brawler (in top 6 or 5 is harder with him than it seems it is just easy to get used to it)
---
50000 star points!!!!!
---
Max looks like a burglar but bea looks good
---
Is it supposed to be funny (sorry if it is)
---
I’m happy with whatever they give us, and Carl’s new skin is awesome
---
I m happy for what we got ..  but  actually. Ppl are talking about emotes and new brawl box that's  why I m hype for it .. actually the game has two big problems 
---
1. No communication. (emotes can help it)
---
2. Clan. Activity .. clan is useless.  At this moment .   ..
---
Korega... Requiem da...
---
Oh sweet. I pushed frank to 500 level 1 which was fun. Crow seems a little harder because his health is so low. Can’t get near Emz or 8 bits which seem to be in every lobby I enter
---
it simply means that it might get changed before release(like tick was changed from mythic).
---
Yeah cough to death.
---
Leon with smoke trails is faster than Rico with robo retreat.
---
Theyre both unisex names. Max is just a shortened version of Maxine.
---
You can’t chain +2 or +4 cards.
---
28
---
u/kairostime_gaming
---
they are as bad as each other
---
Everytime I don't get Max I eat flesh from people named Max
---
Rip mAh boi Dyna
---
incorrect
---
So just take high damage brawler like 8-bit, don't pick any power cubes and win. Doesn't make sense.
---
On how much trophies do you get then or wich rarity have they???
---
Neither should you
---
The only difference is that Lux looks so much better
---
That ladybug skin too (superhero update? Lol)
---
It's because just the Pam tried to kill me, that's the weird thing
---
How is this funny?
---
I dont get it :(
---
Ok thanks :) And even if the boxes disappear I will just have more starpoints for cheap skins.
---
Its good but smoke trails leon is probably faster
---
Why am I called here?
---
What?
---
He get like 3 remodels
---
Damnnn, it looks great!
---
Yep I had the same problem - Emz and 8Bit everywhere but u sorta just learn how to counter them or stay away from them. Just keep chipping them and get super, then jump on them when ur on full health.
---
then we should call her maxine, spread it
---
Ur the one who picked jessie dumbass
---
Tbh i agree with you, both of these brawlers dont fit in the game, especialy Max. What categotry could we put her in?
---
She is a superhero wannabe in a robot suit. Wild west? Pirate? Arab/Desert? The Junker Family? No nothing fits her... 
---
Bea on the other hand could fit nicely in with Rosa and possibly spike but i hate Max she just does not fit into this game
---
we have no idea how unbalanced plunder mode will be.
---
https://twitter.com/Frank_Supercell/status/1201805162412756992?s=20
---
Also you missed the Capital J
---
new pam skin leaked
---
No, voice no, only a skin
---
+10 powercubes BECAUSE YES
---
Uh oh no
---
It was leaked (I could’ve been fake but looked real), that bea was an epic and max is a mythic
---
Where can I buy brawl stars merchandise?
---
My brain had a mental bug
---
Im spanish tho
---
Are you guys okay you look sick i mean your coughing so much
---
Im ot sure about ur chances left. But I think Supercell has to tell about the chances left before the account is permenently banned.
---
Ea games are 60 dollars, supercell games are free
---
epic
---
Wat
---
Aah okay. R.I.P. I have 0 chests Spared for the update and bye legendary drop rate
---
Yeah i saw that too
---
He'll enjoy this cause honey and honeycombs
---
Where did you get the information?
---
Everybody knows about clans' uselessness. Even Supercell. But it needs a big change. Like an update only about clans. Now it's time for a Christmas update.
---
Ur right, the pic is cropped. I saw this on amino and I know who drew it.
---
Ok Piggy
---
I'm glad that I helped :)
---
He hey i am flying
---
And the cactus robot ?
---
What rarity tho? 
---
Drop ur best guesses
---
yeah, i imagine quick loaders and mortis would be strong. I still hope the new gamemode patches will make TD and LS better but is that of use anymore? we'll see
---
(NOT) HAVING A GOOD TIME, (NOT) HAVING A GOOD TIME
---
I know but Carl is turning into Brock with all these skins
---
I dont think bea is OP but meks she op I still want bea more
---
Me too 🤣🤣🤣
---
My name is Max, and I am the fastest man alive.
---
Ya like 3k dmg?
---
When's Canyadigit gonna get instagram?
---
I can just a 1:40 minutes.
---
I tried to upload to you in google drive and it took one Hour and it’s removed .
---
Say that to El brown
---
Brock looking like he’s from a yaoi
---
Mortis star power 2 with that super and the ball: IT'S HIS META NOW(he runs so fast)
---
Seeing this from hot, i know right
---
Smoke trails Leon: Am I a joke to you
---
im sorry if i sound rude or mean or anything, but people will automatically upvote a good map if they see one, so you won't have to add that in. it makes you sound karma greedy if you get what i mean
---
He's being hung for teaming
---
Lmao that's to true
---
probably mythical and epic
---
Bea is great
---
I have an offer in the shop atm for a discounted Sandy and it’s $46 aud, for a single character
---
Stop. Just stop. Supercell has given us so many things, making the game fun while trying to minimize micro-transaction on the other hand EA has a record of plenty of scandals.
---
This is so sad
---
This is beautiful!
---
why does it matter its a  game i hate u 5yr old get a fuqing education
---
Oh ok thx for telling me
---
They even said in Brawltalk that Max wants to be a super hero :D
---
They're robots we cactus people made. We have some in the wild and are used to fend off enemies when they invade our land.
---
How about el primo with meteor rush?
---
Should be going colt/Leon, Pam, and bull
---
I fixed an issue that was in the first version
---
Edit: first map, hope you like it!
---
I mean stack* , there's a game mode with that.
---
Hhhaaaa
---
Fuck all blet shitty noob kids
---
Love it!
---
Yay
---
Max is a girl even though the mame max sounds like a boy
---
Every box Kairos opens and he doesn't get Bea he  has to eat a bee
---
Stop spamming
---
true
---
What is YT channel?
---
excuse me turbo is a boy if you do not delet dis post rn im call police thanc u
---
Frank said they'll all be remodeled in 2020
---
I would bet by the end of the week. Gives content creators a bit to show some sneak peeks.
---
thank
---
I like how to tried to crop away the memematic watermark but failed
---
I am subscribed to him, I took the image before he uploaded
---
Wow its super cool!!! 🤩✨
---
My favorite brawler is Sweet Rico, it's amazing 😍
---
Good job guy.
---
Nice found👍🌹
---
wow
---
I hope I see too, and get both of them.
---
Man I wish the Brawlidays skins you guys are making would get more attention they’re all so amazing :)
---
It's not real, Lex Photoshopped all that
---
in one update?
---
max best mode is brawl ball
---
You're welcome my friend 😎⚡
---
Nah, throughout 2020. He did say they'll all be done before 2021
---
Finally, a non-9-years-old-kid that's actually grateful for a brawlidays gift that isn't a mega box. Very rare in this sub, so u got my updoot
---
NO U
---
You poco'd your last loco
---
Lol , I assume u don't know how Reddit works . And even though I won't post it because that's none of my business , u want proof? Go check his Twitter account
---
5 Max with super are faster than Usain Bolt, even than Speedy Gonzalez
---
Why is the colt standing in the air
---
Can thumbnails be changed later on?
---
I hate to complain but..
---
Yes it sucks to be a f2p but at least that shows you ain't relying on spending cash on "quirky" brawlers
---
It doesn't suck to be a f2p player if you can at least feel like a god amongst rich 9 year old newbies
---
Tbh, being a f2p at least provides you with a sense of pride and accomplishment, unlike P2Ws and EA
---
Yeah so if someone repetitively told you a joke for the next 2 decades every day of your life, you would like that?
---
Why are you so mad over a Reddit post. Chill. Just cause you don't like it doesn't mean that they can't. Did your high effort post get lost in new?
---
Personally I would say coiled snake
---
Que inglês péssimo,usou oq, tradutor?
---
The Bea one might actually be awarding. Because honey is amazing. It's sweet, sticky, and kinda healthy? I hear it cures constipation, flatulence and intestine disorders?
---
Just go check his Twitter account he did say it
---
Maybe they have inspired...
---
Did you download a Brawl Stars mod?
---
I dont know what that means
---
The super can't be a coincedence too identical
---
The first pic is Piper shoot
---
The second pic is Penny shoot :"3
---
Gotta go faster
---
At first he would think it's all good, but than he would realize a mix between honey and energy drink probably isn't good...
---
I wanna hear that new crow voice but I like the old one as well
---
Yeah it's the developer build, a russian youtubed got it early for some reason.
---
[ i still little angry cause i'm not good at playing Morist and we almost almost ALMOST win ỌvO ]
---
They aren't even in the game so we don't know
---
From a russian youtuber
---
Kkkkkkkk that IS awesome
---
Its my bad edit srry :(
---
Da
---
Yeah but when youre in a tight spot and their not to far away its definitly better to try and get the shots if cause otherwise you are dead cause they take the prolonged period of time when your not attacking and kill you
---
Well, it is.
---
it can right now,  but there is a clip in brawl talk where his super gets stopped by wall piece. if his super range is really being increased then this might be the nerf along with it.
---
As attack she rolls big snowballs
---
Mulțam
---
Don’t worry
---
IMO: Just because you don't want to buy deals that literally show up everywhere does not make Supercell a microtransaction organization like EA
---
oMG! sUpErcELL rELeAsE so mUch dEalS!!1 gReEdy!
---
I get it, if you don't wanna buy them, don't be a ass about it
---
EA on the other hand, releases things that you need to PAY for to actually proceed in the game
---
Supercell releases things that might give a little help you to proceed the game
---
More like my time to come
---
i think 10k bcz the reward is only a mega box
---
also in every category (epic legy rare super rare)has 4 brawlers but mythical has 3 so one goes to mythical and the other one to the trophie road at 10k
---
Stolen nad old... Karma down
---
Well a russian youtuber got the developer build earlier than the other youtubers
---
... the thing is, I’ve got a report from Darryl, and he told me that you gave Penny 2 sticks of Dynamite as a Christmas present for her and it exploded, Darryl said that you made her cry, so he was angry, that’s why you’re tied up
---
You have banned in twitter lol
---
How do u know
---
Updates probably, like in april somebody did a datamine and they found rosa bibi and tick
---
Thanks Sherlock
---
Leon is still faster
---
Oh boy content creator leaks are never good, guy might get a strike from supercell
---
Wait, so this is not because someone thinks I team?
---
probably just to appeal to the rich masses, they do them and we'll do us
---
I know, the spawn positions are a bit wacky, especially in this map, but I tried to balance the distance from players and boxes
---
Its a pinata for mortis
---
Yes, you can change thumbnail on any video at anytime :)
---
Nice bro! Clutch Up!!!!
---
How ab he just eats steroids to get max
---
Well then what does this have to do with Brawl Stars?
---
Happy caKe
---
r/weeatbees
---
Cya in hot!
---
So cute
---
Huzzah! A man of [BIG BRAIN]!!
---
Bea's lines:
---
Buzz
---
BZZZZBZZZZ
---
They are the same picture.
---
Well that's probably it then, I'd just report the video for clickbait
---
Its not
---
Oops. This was wrong picture. My bad.
---
Pirate content around Christmas? Makes perfect sense
---
Brush it’s when the guy hits you uncharged, he is fking dangerous cause he is charged up
---
Updates probably, they already had tick and bibi in april  https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/bdfhcy/april_15th_data_mining/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
300 gems !!
---
Looks like hes into some bondage shit
---
:D
---
I'm expecting criticism and I'm not interested in karma anyways
---
Logically having a slow character (like the fridge himself) with a speed boost makes no sense. The names being similar I don't understand.
---
the new game mode should be permanent, let's do it
---
This year we already have 3 trophy road brawlers so I don’t think they will released other in 10k this year
---
Tnx buddy
---
They are mythick and epic a bulgarian yt did an oopsie and relesed a video bout them bea-epic max-mythic
---
I concur.
---
Its is easy after new trophy system
---
Yes it will
---
5000 star points seems too much. 500 maybe?
---
Facts
---
I think there are enough differences
---
So cute uwu
---
Most likely going to be epic and mythic, I would be surprised if even one of them is a trophy road due to the fact that we got tick, 8-bit, and emz so close together and with only Sandy being a non trophy road
---
This is credible. He literally showed off gameplay. You can’t fake that.
---
Great Drawing!! Cheez! I’m still having trouble doing basic stuff!
---
This is bulgarian youtuber the clashers he did an oopsie
---
Thanks! The only give away I know about is the wizard barley one, when you make your supercell account. Are there any other giveaways like these?
---
Have u heard of private servers?
---
"Kirby is calling the Police"
---
Isn't that the parents' fault then for not supervising the kids? There are a lot of adults I know that actually spend money on the game.
---
Or search r/MaxGang
---
How long have you been playing? How many trophies do you have?
---
S tier editing
---
Powerplay is not fun, competitive, or rewarding. Please remove it from the game, we deserve better.
---
needs more frying
---
Ok, chill buddy, i have been doing other stuff, i do those memes when i have time and feel like it.
---
But if i do one i ll do yours...
---
Yeah, no more dev builds for him lmao
---
2 years 
---
Almost 14k trophies
---
hMMMMMMmmMmMMMmMM!?!?!?!!?
---
Pretty sure they've never revealed the rarity of the new brawler in a brawl talk unless it's a legendary.
---
 The Bee Movie : Am I A Joke To You?
---
Nice shot bro!
---
Puberty hit hard
---
wouldn't it be called turf?
---
Yeah sure,, take your time 😉
---
#*I am max*
---
This is probably going to be partly true, if they are both high rarity then doubt full, if low rarity then ya, welcome to the speedy bee apocalypse.
---
They did for every one of them but this one for gene they did and even for bibi they did
---
I agree that those skins doesn't have that feature but How does that makes it pay to win? You literally have that feature in your default skin
---
I dont like him either. I have him...but never wanted him
---
r/woosh
---
And Tara in update with Tick get remodel and voice, but none say about it in Brawl Talk
---
Perfect
---
My boi toad :《
---
Lag
---
Ive seen from youtubers and from oj's brawlstars discord, bea is a mythic and max is an epic, hope its not true
---
Is this a "YeAh SuRe TaKe YoUr TiMe" or a "^yeah ^^sure ^^^take ^^^^your ^^^^time" or a yeah dure take your time?
---
Shamanpet?
---
Have you heard of having a brain? This man showcased gameplay, a new ui, a new loading screen, animations on bea and max, new skins and you still can’t believe it.
---
And personally, I like the fan made brawler's look more than the official one.
---
rule 34 artists be like: hehe boi

Bees after Kairos' death from poison:
---
"Get nae'-naed"
---
He passed away last night. He was pronounced brain dead. Thank you though 🙏
---
Take all the upvotes I can give you!!!
---
Do u have a brain for believing everything that is on the internet? Clearly not
---
TBH the new game mode should have been permanent (cause it's the most requested game mode in the sub)
---
Mortis: First time?
---
(Mortis also got nothing in Brawloween update)
---
Rule34 wants to now your direction
---
2 years of investment into a mobile game is a lot, and you would have new content every time they launch something. I think the problem here is not how easily you got all brawlers, but how much time you have already invested.
---
Ummm? I am asking in a nice way cause I am a nice man😘😉
---
I love that show I just wish I could find the French translation for captions instead of just the English closed captioning.  I hate the dub I can can only watch in french

Definitely not a responsible person in general. 😉
---
PS: It's seaweed.
---
I’m talking about if you have rock a billy or night witch equipped then you can’t see any glow unlike no hat and hat mortis. If people know about the glowing lantern thing and they got one of those skins equipped, they wouldn’t know until mortis pounces on them
---
Oh my god
---
So… cruel ……
---
You think we are too lazy to check the Brawl Talk? Yeah, you are right.
---
Well, Supercell's main goal is to make games that will be palyed for mnay years and remembered forever
---
So they did reach that goal for their games
---
As a mobile gamer, I don't play any pc/console games
---
Have a lolipop
---
This is not the update i expected...
---
ok
---
Now do it with mortis
---
I don’t understand, what do you mean, but ok ;).

Emoji movie is much more fun than bee movie

IMHO
---
Danny are u bg
---
Lmao! So true though!
---
Controversial comment intensifies
---
You also have two legendaries but okay
---
Where did you hear about bea being a epic
---
When is the update?
---
I guess it’s just the good players who team up with friends — clearly not yourself. Sorry to hear that
---
And 10$ to open the game
---

What on earth is hanging out of her mouth
---
Bulgarian bs players(also me) :this was a joke that we to lucky to understand
---
Please don't change Crow VO :(
---
so we have ladybug and queen bee from mlb?
---
Not a serious question, more of a video idea. Are you going to have a video of eating bees until you unlock bea?
---
So his bea has 600+ trophies  !?? That's clearly photoshop....yeah that youtuber is lying
---
I wonder if she will be trophy road or box
---
bruh XD
---
In my opinion there has to be at least 1 new player with enemy if we have one as well
---
Thought so
---
I agree but is her eye glowing?
---
Yes
---
Turbo is a dude m8
---
No coz it goes from the highest ranked player in the team and puts u into a game from that
---
Its very op
---
Where is this from??!!
---
Ah yes a brawl-book mom
---
I was thinking lightning max from OPM
---
This is so stupid and unfair
---
is that sarcastic? or not 
---
idk
---
I’m not getting upvotes tho this is one of my best plays
---
Guess I got r/wooooshed then...
---
The world finals calendar
---
Ur still eventually gonna get them anyways, f2p or not.
---
The what?
---
My problem is that I find people with brawlers that have the same trophies, but they have like half my total trophies so they lack the most common sense.
---
If just supercell was smart enough to make a christmas update instead of this fake pirate shit when in reality the two new ugly ass brawlers have nothing to do with pirates...
---
NICE
---
Remember brawl stars world finals
---
Also a bit too simple re-color
---
I’m talking about what Lex said, even if it isn’t right I personally think it is super rare but be like that
---
most of the people that watch him are kids who don't have credit card's or something like that to pay for this 2-4 days he removed the video and said to not go to this site's.
---
I have all but Sandy and Leon at 7k
---
I did buy crow though
---
They made a calendar and they had a picher and then it had jessie in the corner
---
Where did they published it?
---
Boohoo Let me press F on the world smallest keyboard *presses F*
---
its an axtra hitpoint.. if you get another hit you ded
---
He deleted it because it was against supercell rules the Chanel is called TheClashers Gaming
---
Leon with super and smoke trails: I am 4 parallel universes ahead of you.
---
I didn’t get it until I read the comment this is hilarious 😂. Also the art is great
---
Yeah that can happen. I think there is a timer
---
Every box i dont get max, i eat car
---
Cursed account
---
Trying to ... what
---
Faster than Primo meteor rush?
---
They just gave it away wait I'll show you a video of it I will leave a link
---
I agree, Bea is okay. Max should atleast had a different colour palate and supercell could've done better with her helmet, its just too generic
---
https://youtu.be/SfufllpkzTo
---
Bune le
---
And nothing about catastrophics connections ?
---
It's not but now that I think of it, u say that supercell is the one that needs to stop. Is there any other alternatives? I know we can't just tell parents be more mindful of their children so I feel like deleting loot boxes is the only way. I feel like deleting loot boxes is a bit too much. When I first came across EA's scandal, I realized that supercell has done the same. Supercell although is on a lower level and this has not been brought up to court or been mentioned by anyone who is "higher".
---
Ses efso
---
I've matched with guy had 550 trophies primo but his total trophies were like 700
---
K thanks

---
Now Max just have to say Hasagi
---
Wut
---
this... doesn't mean anything  
---
he just kinda shrugged it off without saying anything, how're you so sure that the mode got deleted all of a sudden  
---
i mean i wouldn't complain but y'all could get in the olympics for how fast you jump to conclusions
---
What youtuber
---
To tell OP the sad truth of posting this on Reddit.
---
That must be moss
---
Wow thanks you’ve got my upvote
---
It's hella cold being encased in snow, Bruce needs warm hugs
---
I want to ne permanent
---
bea is actually epic and max is a mythic
---
Claro que no. El cofre seguirá ahí, tus trofeos no
---
It won’t be on any console
---
I am at 7k and already have a legendary

Lex said himself he was guessing.

Nobody mentioned it because they are brawlers waaaay faster than colts slick boots

Dpydy9ydyy9d I can't spell

Max will be Mythic.

Bea will be Epic.

---
Can’t wait thx
---
Np

I personally prefer this than the same boring Christmas theme. The new brawlers are cool and I don't really care if they are not pirate themed. We already got 7 pirate themed brawlers (Darryl, Penny, Tick and the skins for Gene, Colt, Poco and Carl). We still don't have the full list of what the update will give us and there's probably much more than what they've shown. I too would like some club improvements but, hey, we might get chat emotes in this update. And they're probably preparing some ideas for club wars and things like that.
---
Genially,really
---
Completely out of the blue but ok
---
I miss him too maybe he‘ll become a skin
---
Because you know,Sandy's Gems ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
WHEN TF IS THE UPDATE COMING OUT I CAN'T WAITT AAAAH
---
wow is there transgender in brawl stars??
---
Be positive 
---
Less brawlers = fast progression 
---
Takes more time to lvl up if you have all the brawlers
---
Here take upvotes but seriously tho follow the meme template
---
How do you know there's gonna be new music
---
They never expect it
---
Aaaaaaa! Thank you for pointing out the error to me, I did not expect this from the translator. I fully used the Internet translator in those sentences and I wrote about it there. It's not my fault. But still, forgive me. Here I also used the Internet translator, sorry if there were errors too. If anything, I know the word "ошибки" translated into English as "mistakes".
---
Something something BrawlstarsP
---
I saw max and thought mega man
---
Spooky
---
Congrats :)
---
%0.1100
---
Happy cake day!
---
Yes Russians are he bane of my existence in this game. It's absolutely infuriating, all the worst players I encounter seem to be Russian. They're either afk, have bad connection or seem to be drunk/retarded. 
---
I live in the Netherlands too I don't want to get matched up with Russians anymore, it sucks major ass and puts a major damper on my enjoyment of this game.
---
This is ya boi max with energy drink!😅
---
It wasn't.
---
Oh... 😳
---
It would be cool
---
Hmm, imagine if Tick gets shipped with someone... that'd be sort of... weird?
---
Nice meme very relatable
---
Brawl Hero 6
---
Yes he's the Captain
---
Pretty sure it isn't
---
Is there a mental condition you can't cure?
---
how many boxes would be there
---
r/Youbrokethechain
---
Slower but better matchmaking ;)
---
Actually it's not the first Brawl Talk
---
There was Brawl Talks during beta but they made all those Brawl Talks private for some reason
---
I got Spike with 1k Out of a free Box from the shop
---
You actually should. 1 person (highest dps brawler) should be taking all of them. Less chance of wasting any powercubes at all (by dying).

---
 Imagine if they gonna buff Tick's health
---
Noice
---
I feel like i watching a brand new Brawl TV..
---
And yes, i feel dizzy now XD
---
I agree to an extent, but I think 0.4sec buff is too much, maybe like 0.2 buff.
---
Okay but a darryl shouldn't lmao
---
Thx for information!
---
But you get an invincibility shield for a brief period.
---
&lt;.&lt; Why are those two dummy T H I C C? &gt;.&gt;
---
It’s usually the day after brawl talk but not sure
---
I’m not sure there’s really an alternative, and I also don’t think removing lootboxes fixes the problem.
---
I feel like a season pass would work well. That way supercell can make money of off new content that they create instead of having to make cosmetics (cosmetics dont improve the game, they’re only there to monetize) or lootboxes. Creates a steady flow of money that is paid by all players in fairly equal amounts. 
---
Games need to make money to exist, but you shouldn’t make games to earn money. Lately it’s been mostly that second option.
---
Hah, I don't
---
*Can someone explain how to do it ? It sounds fun*
---
How do You get this brawlers?
---
OMG YAY! I WANTED BEA AS EPIC!!!
---
carl is faster with super 
---
also calm down lol
---
Enrgy drink mixed with bees

I mess up.. and forgot to put "score" in it

she looks kinda DiSoRtEd but it's decent

I cant wait 🤘💪
---
They’re not pay to win, they’re pay to speed up progress. You can do everything (that matters) f2p. The only things that cost money are things you can get f2p, skins/decorations (which don’t affect gameplay) and that’s it.
---
its always wednesday

\^ when two-year-olds learn cuss words

How tf can you expect thousands of people to split perfectly?
---
I seen from kairos's vid that they are both mythic
---
I have been saving gems for this occasion.
---
Still only 1HP afterwards
---
Nice clips, tho a bunch are not really impressive
---
I have 14k and have 2 legendaries (Sandy and Crow) lul
---
Agreed
---
I don’t. Which is why it never will be equal.
---
We will see, you don't work in supersell.
---
I think they have money for this.
---
Ok, Gordon Ramsey.
---
I know
---
I'd count a 52/48 split as people loving them equally.
---
Ok salty he can’t relate to the community around him
---
I love it
---
It’s because Frank (game lead) said it on february...
---
Probably. I said Leon is the fastes brawle. So what's the point of asking about Primo?
---
Uh oh
---
I know it's ok!
---
So, just to add some context to this:
---
I jumped into a random Gem Grab match and I could already tell my teammates didn't see very good. After we lost the match I checked my teammates profiles. 
---
The 608 trophy Shelly had a highest trophy count of 4856, with the rest of her brawlers being very low trophy. 
---
The 0 trophy 8-Bit (why playing a game at the 600+ trophy rang) had only a total of 6003 trophies. 
---
Brawl Stars team, please fix this. It's honestly so exhausting to play the game when you know, some games you just can't win. 
---
Please, add a way to balance a team. Wouldn't it be possible to make teams based of total hit points so its not just a team of lightweights versus a team of heavyweights where one team just get murdered? Is it not possible to ensure that you're playing people with similar skill and in the same overall and brawler trophy range with you? 
---
I'm begging. On my knees here
---
Very nice idea!
---
your art style somehow made them even cuter! very nice
---
What do you even mean? Im glad I don't play minecraft anymore if that's what you mean.
---
I would count it as people slightly liking Bea more.
---
What is Max's second star power?
---
Minesweper:im joke to 
---
Everyone
---
Its the dumbest. No way im spending 500 gems on sandy
---
Did he said why?
---
I am pretty sure there is a wasp girl in marvel already
---
I just love all ur fanarts style amazing
---
Oh! Thanks for explaining! Now I understand :). it's not sarcasm.
---
Max will be broken
---
bea will be broken too
---
How do you pull this off
---
Beacause it’s just a mobile phone, that’s what scell do, mobile games
---
I can’t do this again but the fact that I could experience Insane XVI was amazing!
---
why is she sucking her own glove that does not have a good taste believe me ive tried
---
Bea looks Like a boy in that icon
---
But we don't see much
---
The most cursed accont that i have seen
---
He’s just gonna give them back to the enemy team
---
I do not know but as soon as I left the game and pressed the ready button after the crest the lobby button, I got put in this lobby
---
Theres a war already
---
I know, i don't like changes generally, not in brawl stars, i don' like them even irl
---
I really like Piper montage
---
13k when they get legendary be like:
---
Hey guys just wanted to clear up it wasn’t mainly about the clips being great it was about how the musics best drop is synced with the piper shots being hit
---
If you enjoyed this video I’d appreciate it if you checked out my channel

Thx!

Lmao but Max is Mythic...
---
Nice job dev!
---
I love aesthetics changes in video games and irl
---
Not really.This was just a thought.
---
No sorry,but nice artwork!
---
and max is Speedy
---
Me too.

Repost
---
Worse idea than this i didnt heard never
---
Definetly in the "No time to explain" video. It's perfect
---
That skin kinda looks like Dark Crow in Persona 5...
---
What is IT?!
---
Why it will be better ?
---
I think you lose it but once you gain those trophies again you can acces it
---
Petition to add friendly matches for ticketed events.
---
He's a Mythic so I agree 110%.
---
And my guess (and im sure) that max and bea will be broken
---
It’s even more true cos of how gene super works
---
No. Reindeer Nita is enough.
---
I dunno man, I'm not good enough to play with one hand while holding a magnifying glass.
---
I aint triggered but thanks for the fax
---
r/titlegore
---
No i think the update will be pirate themes bcs they want something new and fresh to keep their playerbase interested
---
You ever heard of Thousand sunny from One piece?
---
Yeah!
---
I said that they will be broken but no one believe
---
😒
---
now downvote me for saying a opinion
---
So why 8-bit and max is releated?
---
Honey Nut Cheerios?
---
For me it look  funny how Nita is standing and trophy
---
Yea but everyone is being disappointed because no pam remodel
---
My speculation is wednesday or friday (but mostly wednesday)
---
That’s a Penny shot for anyone that can’t tell
---
Also look at the ammo bar it changes as well. So does the attack.
---
But is he getting his voice atleast? Will his remodel be the next one?
---
You smart character reference memer
---
also hi there romanian person :)
---
She will get it sometime.
---
The real question is who is behind these helpdesks
---
Damn. 
---
It just shows how you feel, perfectly visibile in the image.
---
Cheer up!
---
:)
---
that was just max
---
*unpleased Darryl noises*
---
Mortis is also a boomer
---
Yea frank said after this year she might get it check it on Twitter I think
---
Max the new broken mythic
---
Bea the new broken epic 
---
Also their pictures(icons) are terrible and max will be just like piper remodel pictures before the dev team fixed it
---
Can you explain what you mean with this
---
Please, could you change Tara's voiceover? Please, she's my favourite brawler. Her voice should listen like  ,,Wraith's voice from Apex legends".
---
Yea, it shouln’t be based on the cups of 1 brawler. A lot of new players push shelly to 550 but they still suck so hard. The difference between 10k cups and 18k is huge.
---
Lmao I didn’t stalk your profile. I only noticed this post which was on the top of your profile. Stealing posts is never allowed in reddit. Or any other social media. The least you could have done was credit me, because I took this screenshot of my band mates a year ago.
---
True
---
Dab
---
*Are you sure about that?*
---
Hey man, its not like its an idea of mine, it already exist in the brawl talk video, i am just pointing it out :/
---
I want a legendary or free skin
---
Pls no he's already too good
---
Do you know anything about genetics or hair tho
---
Amazing!
---
I upgraded my Mortis to lv 8.
---
How do I show it?
---
aha, my current trophy count is 13,192
---
Can you link this video or explain what he leaked more precisely
---
I will call 911
---
Oh sorry it was meant to be a joke I know that sorry for sounding aggressive
---
They will be broken max and bea
---
The new pictures will be terrible max will be worse than piper pictures before the dev team fixed it
---
Lazer ball is Jessie's regular attack i think.
---
Any Dipset fans out there? Lol Max B?
---
Yes DIE DIE!
---
Quick and good artwork
---
The middle one is his dick
---
Hey! If you sre interested in seeing gameplay of the new skins and brawlers dm me on twitter @ViperBrawlStar
---
Tara's remodel was a surprise, so we have to be hopeful
---
Or he would eat a bee every time he opens a box and doesn't get bea
---
U know, a polish dude
---
Well they aren't for a specific time of the year like the Christmas skins so probably yes
---
But doesn't Crow already have a voice? Why is his VO under discussion?
---
Rule 34- If it exists, there is porn of it. If there isn't, there will be.
---
They work in groups
---
DEETS
---
Nita and Bruce are also dressed like this
---
Wait, its he or she?
---

Dood you could have said

Brawl Stars Update Bea Like
---
But Crow got his voice in beta
---
On the dev build Bea was epic and Max Mythic
---
Yeah, I thought the same.
---
They can do a "timebreaker" Max skin,too😂
---
Got Sandy before viewing this so I feel lucky
---
I'm Bull so I must like bush
---
Um. I'm not Polish
---
Hmm great
---
Chill you need patience
---
Oh, that is wierd
---
I think he didn't use Max's second star power in the video?!
---
The 2 curved lines and the !
---
After a while you would wanna purge
---
I still have no legendaries with a .3% chance right now...say goodbye to my chances lol. I’m just going to stop wasting gems on token doubler discounts and just save the gems to get a legendary brawler in shop. Token doublers just help raise my fake chance of getting one... tired of endless boxes with 50 coins in them
---
I'm not the only one!!
---
Breaking news: 
---
A barrel steals the christhmas
---
voting right now isn't going to matter as we don't know whether people will enjoy the mode or not  
---
people were genuinely excited for lone star and takedown, but after a while everyone seemed to hate both of the modes like siege
---
Kairos did a test when Carl first came out. His super is faster.
---
With the new mode this will not happen
---
Why you say this i was talking for the max and bea pictures, that they will be terrible. the most terrible picture will be max. (if they wont fix it) you say something different why?
---
Stolen!
---
Why am I triggered lol, I had every brawler in the game when I used to play brawl stars, I quitted since February
---
Its probably kelp or some kind of seaweed..
---
That happen with gene
---
Its stolen Dyna....
---
Also for this i dont care it doesnt matter
---
Oof I only got it half right then 😉
---
He's not. He released info early. Wasn't supposed to
---
Dude you should know that Carl's super and Leon's super time differs. They have the same movement speed but Leon's last less longer I think.
---
That is probably food Mortis is saving for his family reunion dinner
---
omg so good!
---
First Skin idea for Bea i see! Now,its Maxs turn..
---
God this whole thread from here on out was bad.
---
Good on ya!
---
mortis coiled snake + drink + max super
---
Imagine having maxed Max
---
Opinions shall not be allowed 😡
---
Bruh im 16.5k and i get matched with 5k people
---
Darryl too
---
He is definitely at the bottom of the meta. Well the problem is exactly that one: the fact that a brawler is good in 1v1 but sucks bad at 3v3 is not good, as the game is meant to be 3v3 first. IMO he should be viable at least in some 3v3 modes, as rn he sucks in any of them.  
---
p.s. sorry for the bad english
---
I feel like I see you under every post these past 20 minutes
---
I mean bron (the account above)
---
He changed the thumbnail to get more views
---
UwU
---
This meme doesn't even make sense the format is so wrong
---
Then stop speaking p2w im f2p
---
Every amazing game is having a bee in their latest update!
---
🤔 maybe she won’t be able to get the bonus attack if she attack the safe.  so only 1000ish damage unless she attack another player then the safe.
---
Have none of y'all seen Frank's tweet? He said after this update Spike will be the only mute brawler, they never announce voices in Brawl Talks
---
Why not? ;D
---
Oh, thanks 💦💦
---
people just running in auto aiming
---
Nice
---
How they look? She’s in a full helmet in bodysuit. Granted her pose is a bit contorted so we can’t see her full figure. Though, Sandy’s face and body fit how the male brawler’s bodies look in their models. Most male brawlers have broader faces, shoulders, and longer legs. (With maybe the exception of Poco and those who lack a “normal” body like Tick and 8-Bit.) From a character designing standpoint I think their appearances fit their genders just fine, though I do see where you’re coming from!
---
I already did this meme but still gave it an upvote. You gave more effort than i did.you deserve it.
---
this one is different cause it's the most requested game mode in the sub
---
The exact reason why I hate math 😂 u lost me at "school"
---
Don't you have anything else to say other than throw around random terms you heard on the internet? I'm not even an adult and I'm male, and you call me a "boomer" and a "karen".
---
Brawlers inspired from 2 trash movies (No hate if i hate cars)
---
In my opinion they're bland and uncreative, i mean seriously, you have unlimited possibiltys, endless choices,themes but they give green light to these lame characters in tracksuits, and even if you try to defend them whats up with Bae's boring face.
---
There's also a chance it hasn't been added because either it isn't high on their priorities or they just don't think it'll work. If it's on their priorities and we mass request them, they'll probably add it faster. However, there is also a good chance they just don't think it won't work, and it's happened before where the community really wanted a concept to be added but supercell didn't add it for whatever reason.

Nita feeling herself in the background
---
The first thing i was thinking about and i saw the brawl talk
---
That's not the point
---
How would you rate your pain ?
---
I don't care because i don't have him
---
Or maybe they think it's not a good idea or that It wouldn't work that great?
---
I wouldn't say they are lazy... It's not that easy, and maybe they have other plans for the game...
---
Sorry links don't work on this :c
---
Малиии голям сеир
---
This is big brain time. I don't want to shatter your bubble but they don't give a crap about what we post in 99% of the cases here
---
Wasn't him mate, it was this Bulgarian YouTuber and its a screenshot from his video.
---
yea that's what i think
---
Dude I wasn't being serious on the lazy part 💀💀
---
R.i.p my legendary chance
---
Ah sh\*t, here we go again
---
I bet i won't get max 'cause i already have mortis &amp; gene
---
The search lex brawl stars on YouTube and watch the video lmao 💀💀
---
Welcome to the game where sleepy boi can kill you with a sand
---
Sadly a lot of people disagree
---
unknown
---
Same. I have Leon and Crow.
---

---
She's a epic?!
---
this would make playing with randoms so much better
---
Bringing back limited events would be good, but I don’t think this is the right way.
---
What I’m thinking is make the seasonal event slot semi-permanent like ticketed events, with each temporary mode showing up one time per season, or when new temporary modes are added they’re available every day for the temporary period. For example, after Present Plunder’s period ends every weekend alternates between it and Graveyard Shift, and when a third temporary mode comes out they’re three times in two weeks, so on and so forth, no issues until the 15th seasonal event is added. Next Halloween Graveyard Shift is every day again, next Christmas Present Plunder every day, etc.

eat honey

I AM SPEED
---
Same happened to me yesterday
---
As someone who lives in Belgium, i kinda laughed to this
---
So good!
---
Her mechanics do sound very nice! I was mainly referring to her design. Her suit makes her look more like a Disney Pixar character than a BS one. Though, I’m sure this is something that’ll grow on me since a superhero brawler just hasn’t been done before!
---
Snails are transgenders
---
Thanks!
---
attack and super of the new brawlers
---
They both look really fun too play imo. Only reason i'm more hyped for Bea is because i'm a lot more likely too unlock her
---
Hello frank. I just wanted to let you know that the two new brawlers are aesthetically the most horrible thing i've seen in this game. Not only they're ugly but they don't even fit the game's aesthetic or "lore". They look like some low effort disney pixar's background characters. Really? A wannabe superhero and a baby girl dressed like some 70s housewife?
---
Plus the skins are even uglier. I'd never buy something like that.
---
No hate, i love the game, and i never thought that i'd write something like this, but y'all really should have took the time to make one truly good brawler, and not two mediocre ones. And i can already see how you will need to nerf Max.
---
brawl stars took a dark turn..
---
I do not like this.
---
Oh was just wondering because they had the h’ween theme for almost 3 months, would of liked seeing a Christmas theme but meh
---
That would be even better!
---
Yeah I know but when I wrote the comment I didnt🤣
---
But Night Witch DOES have that effect.
---
Honestly, it looks super cute
---
*I* am about to end *this man's* *career*
---
Fixed it for you.
---
I'm on ur track
---
Не 🇷🇺😂😂😂😂 edit:🇲🇰
---
Then bad in general at most modes and playing one of many modes that he’s not good at. That still happens at almost any trophy range.
---
Nope thats just what I remember, checking the article, she also has a pangoro, falinks, hawlucha, and one other thing
---
Why does this remind me of that time Patrick tried to catch santa XD
---
cheers love!
---
*Dying in poor af*
---
bilmem, güzel mi?
---
Iffy about the futuristic city idea because they are working on christmas updates
---
New pirate skins are coming
---
that’s why the title is “rip mali”
---
You're right. It says "I see you touch yourself on the toilet".
---
I'm already following you, please send me the video
---
that big blank space between the boxes and the mode selection is definitely a place for a possible new box
---
Lone star is the best u dumb
---
Wrong. The fastest match is every power play match I make with randoms. Let's just say we're not the ones scoring.
---
FYI it usually takes about 5-9 days for the update after brawl talk drops, so mark ur calendars everyone ;)
---
This doesn't make sense
---
I hope for a pam skin
---
No one cares
---
energy drink: am I a joke to you?
---
Yeah.Probably some things will change usually brawltubers make videos before update is ready.
---
Yeah eat shit. Your chance wasn't in any reality this high.
---
Dani i made my account the same day u did xD
---
Oh ok I didn't watch the brawl talk yet
---
Oh dam. Also i think I like max a little better than bea, imo. lol
---
OH GOD NO, A NEW CHALLENGER. WHO WILL WIN: Beanos or Beanos?
---
k/d is important only in bounty so in other modes people will prioritize killing that isn't the main objective
---
Its his big p p
---
woah. nice
---
Sucide
---
rosa to bea: what are you doing with nita come help me
---
bea: sure
---
Yeah so maybe by tomorrow or Tuesday we can expect them to upload sneak peeks
---
Editing you did is pretty good actually, you're jugding yourself too hard
---
my own one I made
---
Night mechanic bo?
---
Max's icon is so creepy
---
Its a mix of mold and dirt in the ship from those disgusting dirty boots. Somehow.
---
Come on supercell, clean dem boots.
---
Penny is also an odd on out she is the only human
---
I see
---
Happy cake day! (Still not taking a bite though.)
---
🅱️ is cute
---
Amd it gets 50 upvotes
---
I wonder when they will be releasing them? I got about 130 regular boxes and about 12 big boxes left
---
not funny, didn't laugh
---
could add up more stats like goals, assists, destroying environment n stuff
---
Max icon must be changed
---
Well, not really. Bea is supposed to be Bee. She's been leaked for a long time now.
---
Dude 
---
We saw carl legs a long time ago
---
r/oddlyspecific
---
it's kind of weak yeah, it had a lot of potential! maybe they'll change it until the update goes live?
---
I have a video if you guys wanna see.
---
Nice lie
---
She*
---
Idk if you guys know about finlay and the dwarf son hornswoggle. hornswoggle  would occasionally bring his weird stick to the ring and go for a cheapshot to help finlay or other wrestlers he supported. He could not be called a wrestler since he himself never stepped into the ring and everyone knew if he did, he’ll get smacked by every single wrestler. Yet, the audience cheered for him cuz he was fun to watch. Sounds incredibly similar to someone we all know and love right?
---
Max's Portrait looks cringey
---
Kinda is. Just not officialy. There is gamepaly everywhere online
---
Colt has visited Chernobyl before the fillming
---
Oh man that’s a coincidence! Thanks, I upvoted yours too
---
Nice predictions.But poco isnt recolor and carl have different model so its possible that poco can be 80 and carl 150.At least they arent limited
---
They look very similar to eachother too. I thought they were like a team before i read any info.
---
* aggressive El Primo Meteor Rush sounds *
---
90% Wednesday
---
Bea is epic, Max is Mythic
---
Yeaahh that could be so cool
---
What kind of punishment is eating honey
---
The better indicator is the yellow ammo bar, like piper’s ambush
---
well yes but it looks fun to play
---
True.
---
Oh thank God
---
he lost
---
It's slower than 8-Bit's speed
---
I have total &gt;!6!&lt; brawlers on 500 trophies, all of them are lvl 1 expect colt, that i upgraded accidentally.
---
Well you got on legal ways, right?
---
In that zoomed in picture I saw for first time that picture of El primo in the left bottom 🤣😂
---
Well I guess... it’s basically siege with no robot
---
I just realised that my first girlfriend's name was Bea, in my country Bea is pronounced "Beea"
---
The update probaly come tomorow
---
Max icon is worse than pipers when they remodeled her
---
And a Max are £100.00
---
True lmao
---
You haven't even played it, calm down
---
What was the world record for highest level boss anyway?
---
From a Russian youtuber, who then deleted the video👌
---
It’s mold
---
Low effort post
---
Imagine trying to aim any throwers attack or throwable super with the Switch’s extremely sensitive joysticks
---
Not gonna happen
---
Oh my, so cute!! 🐝
---
everyone forgot the fact that she is the second brawler with 1 ammo and carl is no longer the only brawler with 1 ammo
---
Max is not even out yet, let's wait before complaining.
---
&gt;Crow's trailer voice just sound too... generic?
---
YES THANKS FOR SAYING THIS OH MY GOD IVE BEEN WAITING SO LONG FOR SOMEONE TO POINT THIS OUT THANK YOU
---
It took too long otherwise
---
Hmm yeah I understand that not everyone wants a battle pass. If you’re poor or not that interested it’s a lot of money, but not having it lets you miss out on so much.
---
Supercell has done a lot. I’ve been saving up boxes since Emz and I have more than 300, without spending any money. You get a lot more starkeys than about a year ago. I also like lootboxes myself. but it’s just gambling. 
---
Supercell is so good at monetizing but no one ever stops to think if that’s really a good thing.
---
Like, clash of clans and clash royale had some insane ‘whale players’ that would spend tens of thousands of dollars on multiple accounts. Lets not forget the 500.000 gem tournaments in clash royale when 14.000 gems cost 110 €
---
In clash royale they went full lootbox and they made so much money with it (can’t find a link but def look it up). Now they’re switching to battle passes and cosmetics. Their games are great, but if everyone just paid 5 euros they’d already have enough money.
---
This... Oh this is Beautiful!
---
You mean annoying as fucking fucked up fuck
---
VFX = visual effects

VO = voice over

It’s not foot
