Thanks. All good. Hoping the right people look at it. 
---
Literally me
---
No problem.
---
&gt;Rigged lag?
---

---
It's not rigged because you're losing. You're most likely losing because your connection is getting bad on you.

Check out KyriosTime or look it up on youtube. There are plenty of great guides there.
---
Oh I thought you get something like 1 token per trophy for each brawler over 500. 
---
True, but Supercell killed him in his only game mode. Anyways, congrats on getting those three. Rico is nice, Tara is so versatile, and I always wanted to try Darryl out.

Thanks for the response. Just wondering how even if someone bought a lot of coins, where do the power points come from?
---
I thought he was an onion when I saw his outline 
---
What is sc
---
Looks like a good idea, it'd definitely spice up the game 
---
Just curious though, are you saying crest or chest?
---
And the chick with the umbrella is OP AF
---
Not chest. I believe it's called chrest. Correct me if I'm wrong.
---
Will the Gold Rico skin carry over when the update drops?
---
Leon is still a human he just has spiritual powers
---
Muito massa
---
Im so sad there wasnt any new SFX for Mortis's super, with so many new SFX for Brawlers i thought it would be cool to give him something shinier.
---
supercell 
---
I have 0.2496 for mythic. is that bad?
---
They said exactly on Wednesday 
---
Wow
---
The real point is there is none
---
that‚Äôs some dedication, i like it 
---
Does someone just buy loads of mega boxes until have enough?
---
Anyone know where I can find 3d model pngs of the brawlers?
---
Idk 
---
Wow kyriostime is he like kairostime‚Äôs brother or something
---
Nice little karma farm
---
Congrats
---
Amazing work bud!

Then how do you know it‚Äôs on Wednesday 
---
No
---
What's so cool
---
Lol
---
So you could only move by tapping?
---
Top shelf meme
---
It's crest
---
I believe you‚Äôre trying to say crest, but I can‚Äôt be certain. Maybe try looking it up real fast to see if you‚Äôre misspelling it? Because if you‚Äôre trying to say chrest I have no idea what that could be

The other guy said Wednesday

it's crest
---
Tbh remove some of the grass and it can be a maze 
---
What did u use to make this?
---
Nvm 
---
Yup. And Leon‚Äôs a ninjastaaaaar maaaan... hiding in the bush, 8 seconds is all that he needs to land you on your tush.
---
If you turn the bushes to minimal...will you just see bull standing there?
---
Penny has her voice but ok
---
So immature. 
---
Poor Bo is just so forgettable. Hes like that one friend nobody likes but always has all the money so you let him hang around just to use him lol.
---
Man that date style is foreign to me, that was a chore to interpret lol 
---
wdym tara needs less of a remodel than bo...
---
Thanks \^\^
---
Hooot
---
What did u use to make this
---
She looks even better than your Penny (not that she looked bad though)! Continue your awesome work!
---
I was about to comment that
---
REMODEL!
---
Tara super
---
Thank you!
---
Aah I missed out Tara,ohwell
---
Underrated post
---
Those aren't hats. That's just their hair
---
Take my downvote with your click bait bullshit
---
So its inconceivable to you that someone just likes playing bull or primo? Does not make them retarded you sack of shit
---
Please
---
I have 69 boxes therefore I have more. I wont be reading any replys 
---
How about make the wall come out right infront of you and move like a normal attack untill it reach its max distant where it stops
---
#El Primo cries in the backround
---
ü§§üí¶
---
It‚Äôs entirely possible
---
Isn‚Äôt that map getting removed 
---
You mean..."Frankenstein's monster"?
---
When is another spike skin coming?
---
Frankenstein's monster 
---
This is just a rant from a player who maxed out on a game too fast that was globally released few months ago. Game will be fine, it's still technically a new game and new games need content and end game will be added eventually. Things like clan wars etc can be added in future. Just chill 
---
Also the game doesn't need to be in esports to be successful. Look at clash of clans. No real major competiton
---
I second that.
---
That's how Mafia works
---
Even tho Pam has the HP of a tank she is not, Pam is good in every single fucking mode, even fucking Heist. 
---
That sucks 
---
can we use it?
---
I've seen many noobs saying Leon could kill Primo after 1st nerf - thing is any good primo would keep distance/use ulti. To add on Primo isn't even good other than brawl ball which is getting nerfed soon.
---
I love it, why are there 7 brawlers?
---
1.7k have spike and Leon
---
Same 
---
Her super is the only reason she's playable
---
RIP 
---
We felt worse 
---
Keep grinding. I was finally able to get him up to 500 for me, but it takes a lot of patience especially without him upgraded or his star power like I had. 
---
You think so? I haven't really thought about strategy very much yet but I figured it would be important for there to be someone who could blow up the TNT fast and another person to apply pressure around the other side.
---
;(
---
THis is genius please supercell
---
Yeah because of there skins but try do have a other skins slot tho
---
49 gems for 10 boxes.
---
 50 gems for 10 boxes.
---
You will save 1 gem so its worth it
---
Can you explain why matchmaking is such trash in this game? Constantly put with people thousands of trophies below my own trophy level that don‚Äôt even understand the game, some of them don‚Äôt even move. It‚Äôs so tired of it 
---
primo takes actual skill
---
I don't think you have any idea, of how fast I really am, I'm fast as F**** BOII
---
alright do it then
---
For some odd reason I get triggered when people say yass so downvote to you my good man
---
r/foundthemobileuser
---
Never skip leg day and you too can be Brock! Great work üëçüèΩ
---
Cant do that on the same server 
---
Yeah they  are from the skins but they do have a other skin  that might take there hat so maybe 
---
Also when he shoots cartridges come out even though they are revolvers.
---
Now i can read this with Mortis' voice
---
I got 70 normal boxes, 5 big boxes and 1 mega box in master 2 (580 keys season reward)
---
That‚Äôs factssss
---
Yea shelly and primo/only primo for tnt and penny for side control
---
I think Rocky is a great brawler idea, except to add onto it I feel that if both his attack and special involve building walls, it might be a bit op. Instead, his attack could be throwing a boulder (because we need another thrower in the game). To make this attack distinct, it could have a much larger radius compared to the other thrower attacks, but be slower or take longer to reload. To add on to this, the star power could be like Spike's main attack, but instead of spikes flying in all directions, it could just be a wave of rock. I really hope this brawler will be added in the game. Make it happen!
---
Lol who plays clash royale anymore
---
Play showdown and camp with Bull  ‰πÅ(·¥ó Õú ñ ·¥ó)„Ñè
---
Gimme toes dem
---
 Bush camp in solo to get them back
---
Bull is wayy to close to jessie... and we all know what his fist is doing üò£
---
While I‚Äôve played every day since global and don‚Äôt even have penny or Darryl
---
I've hit 12k and I am stuck at 19 brawlers 
---
No, the offer expires before the update so I would buy the tokens.
---
Think of it this way
---
Option 1 = 10 boxes for 49 gems  + chance to get Leon
---
Option 2  = 10 boxes for 50 gems + chance to get Leon and/or Gene (because you can save them for after the update.)
---
You are basically spending only 1 extra gem just so you can wait until after the update.
---
Nice! I just hit 6k. I have started on the USA launch day. Just wish i had a level 9 champ lol
---
How was this mare
---
I tried posting a video but for some reason I can't upload those. I should have just tried to put the message out with a pic like you did. But yeah, that happens to me a lot. And its annoying if you need it fast, like trying to escape for you're life with crow's super(Its happened to me uncountable times)
---
Sounds cool but not sure if its really a lake i see it more like a river imo.
---
Back when crows super was slow as heck.... *sheds tears*
---
I feel like it would also be helpful to have someone who could blow out the back wall too to blow open the map 
---
Gemas
---
Shelly/Primo
---
YEEEEES
---
 
---
That's cool!
---
Ooo yeah that looks better than most of the atm not bad
---
So cute!
---
First of all stop stating the obvious. You‚Äôre not the only one with access to the Brawl Talk and YouTube. They are just stretching the SAME update to check for bugs. And what the actual fuck does making illusions mean?
---
Clever

It's the best!

Wow! Spike!

Yeah, they are intended to be  *bull noises*

If the servers are improved on in this next update, definitely not!

I respect that! It‚Äôs not bull himself I hate it‚Äôs just those people that will camp in bushes until the end and catch you off guard

If you would frequent the subreddit you would see that everyone is hyped

Lol. The translator did a bad job but I get the idea. What is our problem though? 
---
Thanks supercell
---
Another one bites the dust
---
Hey what were the downvoted comments? 
---
Maybe some colors/props in the background such as bushes 
---
Because of ur ignorant comment 
---
This is actually a good suggestion, but bush in the middle (except cavern churn) will always facing attack from every direction. Also sometimes people will just team against middle bush camper, which must be address before your suggestion can be implemented.

Enough people

Okay, well I've been playing this game for a year and a half and I forgot about that... Damn.
---
Still gotta admit the images actually make them look stranger than they are, plus the match with level 1 bots made it weird to look at compare. Also there is something actually strange in that imgur link that shows a bull with Pam's ability.

Who said you won? Go back to fortnite you filthy 6yo

Thanks bro this is epic.

Im guessing that might be the aftermath of tara's super

That is the true surprise. Leon has more range and more damage.
---
barely's hat is there too
---
You know you should just delete reddit and clash royale and brawlstars because all you ever do on them is complain and you never State any good things Mr. I think I'm cool because I spam HAHAHAHA and I hold a bad opinion against everybody so that means I'm even more cool AHAHAHAHHAHA
---
Mista will die sooner than later 
---
I want a pam skin :)
---
Same lol
---
Fuk
---
That was better. Keep trying, you are doing great! Your insults are improving!!! Congrats!!!

Ooh I have a good impression of you know "HAHAHHAHAHAHAHAH OMG OMG OMG HAHAHHAA SOOOO CUTE HAHHAAH OMG HAHHAHAHAH OMG WOWWOWOWOOWOWOWOW OMG HAHAHAHA
---
When you steal a book under your sweater and hope no one notices 
---
Care to explain the joke
---
its good photo shop tho
---
Yeah I already knew that, but for some reason it just didn't occur to me that this is what's happening. But it would be cool to see a mode for brawl ball or showdown that basically gives you Pam's star power.
---
Very cool
---
Some of the other brawlers are getting a remodel so you wi probably have to change it again 
---
Nah, it happened twice and the first time it followed the bull. I can't make a gif for you but you can watch the brawl talk and slow it down to x0.25 speed and watch the whole thing.
---
So op
---
Yeah this edit looks really good. You did amazing photoshopping this
---
You forgot dynamike and nitas hats
---
If it was the 3 legendaries, then that would be *the* best Big Box possible. But this is still incredible! I've been playing for weeks and I still don't have any Epics, Mythics, or Legendaries. ;~;
---
Looks great
---
It‚Äôs before the update so there‚Äôs no way.  Also there was a similar post about Gene being photo shopped in a while ago for shits and giggles
---
I hate brawl ball people dont know how to play it!
---
Lots of people have posted this glitch on this map. :P Last time it was in rotation, it was the top post.
---
Do you play on locked movement control? If not you should turn it on in the settings and see if it helps :)
---
OMG THIS HAPPENED TO ME ONCE
---
It's like you just looked at my replay and recorded it and stuck your name on it
---
ur gem count...its so high
---
Buy gold Rico now so that you save 50 gems when the update drops
---
If you‚Äôre moving quick the person won‚Äôt realize you‚Äôre on top of them until it‚Äôs to late
---
Already bought that skin, as a f2p i can say that this is better than a maxed brawler :^)
---
Ok thanks! I'm just afraid that they remove the whole wild west thing and replace it with some city theme after a while.
---
I tried to add some of my coc clan friends using their # on first day . But there is no option to do that
---
You should really add a legendary in the shop like clash Royale 
---
Oh my goodness - players like this grind my gears. Sorry for the trophy loss, mate!
---
r/BrawlStarsThieves 
---
How do you work these stats out
---
So lame !! They are many things they need to do to this game . 
---
Speaking of, I can‚Äôt find a help thread, but should I buy the character tokens from the shop for coins? In essence, how easy are coins to come by?
---
-we-
---
Oh no practice mode isn‚Äôt back, only able to exit friendly battles 
---
I say buy double token thing form shop using gems and save coins for brawlers update .
---
I'd say it's before Feb starts
---
that‚Äôs so crazy
---
Wednesday or Thursday 
---
I actually hate the new model regular model. The king is kinda cool though and I already have the gold skin so there‚Äôs that
---
Wow that is well made. Dopeee
---
Yeah, you can clearly see that the same beam comes out on the 2nd attack
---
Too much for a kids game.
---
His name is gene 
---
I am guessing Wednesday. However, I am hoping to see it tomorrow! 
---
I always see people posting about this, but this has never happened to me. What type of phone are you all on?
---
Could you make Barley's golden skin throw Molotovs?
---
I'll take that as a complement 
---
Well nothing can be done, or at least I don‚Äôt know anything. There‚Äôs no reporting system and I don‚Äôt think their support team would do anything. Sorry
---

You got some footage! Now got his profile and get his player tag and send it to supercell. Hopefully they will do something

Scaremortis skin for crow

It‚Äôs true, he didn‚Äôt, but he did get it with one win

Go to your shop, click the Big Box. Click the i in the top left corner and it will bring up your luck rating for drops. 
---
Me üò≠üò≠üò≠

They have that... it‚Äôs a friendly battle with bots
---
Nice
---
Brawl boxes and big boxes are quests and objectives
---
I mean like, a constructed shooting range with multiple bots aand I just described Friendly battles didn't I.
---
Tara would drag his ass back tho.
---
Lucas?
---
This games balance is bullshit and some characters are utterly broken. How did this happen? Because theh dont give a fuck. They just want To make money
---
Is like the free box come back
---
Needs a watermark
---
OB player is redundant 
---
Would love to see an Asian brawler sometime in the future!
---
Thats enough for me ::))
---
Oh great another one that I won‚Äôt get xD 
---
looks very similar to the game's art style, great job
---
Really?
---
Thanks! I'm glad you think so! ÔΩ•‚ó°ÔΩ•
---
What is the limit per day?
---
That‚Äôs why you play in a gameroom
---
Just bad design. Thankfully his new redesign will solve it and look ten times better. 
---
Pam is ssoooo good in every game mode (robo rumble, showdown and gem grab) the best ones
---
Nice you wanna know what I get every time?
---
Well I get power points for brawlers that i dont need and im not planning to max plus i get so small amount of them....

*visions of dynamike*

Nice!

Frank said that gene is coming in mid february

Pressure on goalie haha

When will the brawler come out
---
Oh ok. Thx
---
I'd prefer just gems
---
Haha true
---
Its all about the brawler
---
So glad they added coins tbh
---
Where's the spike and pam nerf
---
Players token limit increased to 200? That's amazing
---
Is there a reason the game is crashing every time I try to play?
---
noe i am realy happy i bought it for 30
---
if i had the chance i would have played since soft launch. When it came out i pre ordered it instantly
---
Finally!
---
He won't be released until mid February, this was stated multiple times.
---
Coming mid February 
---
Half of february
---
That's just my guess, I'm not trying to say it should be removed.
---
Yeah,you can do this but in your video you will say my nickname.

i added it to the photo

I played as Mortis and only got like 1 thrower per game :c

Is there any reason why life leech was removed?

No more gem grab with the shittest brawler possible for that map

3 skins in the right or permanent or will they dissapear after lunar new year?

What all the fuss is about? He is still a shitty brawler...

Pretty sure he needed 7 attacks to kill tanks and now just need 6! So op!

Yep
---
I got 3 other Morts, 1 barley, 1 primo spike and a lotta shellys
---
His cape looks FABULOUS
---
Overall Bo got nerfed.
---
Went from worst brawler to the worst of the worst brawler.
---
Why is it hard when you don't hve enough gems to buy any of those?
---
This isn‚Äôt exclusive. You can calculate this from the video in Brawl Talk. If his damage was 1400 at max lvl, then that means he‚Äôs been upgraded by 40% which means the base stats are 100% and max stats are 140%. With that in mind, you can divide by 140 and multiply by 100 and you get his base damage. This will work for his HP and his super. 
---
Not really. Menus become smoother but matches have a bit more lag
---
I feel like a LOT of people didn't watch/pay attention. So many questions being asked that were answered in the brawl talk and even up to a week ago 
---
Any skin with a sign on their bottom left is limited time offer- Same thing for Christmas skins
---
The blue background is so ugly. There were a thousand art concepts, pick up one for next update.
---
There is also a lvl 75 offer.

---
Its cool
---
Omg hacker!!!
---
...and some random guy say it now not upgraded to max
---
do you have the ‚Äúbetter chest‚Äù version 
---
Bigger question is why event modifiers no longer appear on other game modes besides Showdown... Why did they have to remove that. Event modifiers is a nice way to add a unique layer of fun to the modes to mix things up
---
Actually I don't think the new one is that bad
---
Yeah..
---
You dont have the update yet?
---
1400 damage is at max level only, this must be level one or so
---
literally a clone of Roadhog's mechanics
---
1400 only when he is maxed. 1000 is the starting damage on level 1
---
thats at max lvl, this is lvl 1 stats
---
Me to
---
I do, you ruined the prequel meme quote
---
I think that poison should stack somehow even if is just for ammo and not for daggers.. and maybe with not full damage.. like.. first ammo 98poison dmg ... if you hit a target again the poison increase only half like 98+49=147... an each poison has his own duration so you cannot stacks forever... just saying because there is little gain when you have all 3 ammo and unload in someone.. becaus the poison dmg will be the same..
---
It looks pretty interesting, specially the star power
---
I mean. The older one just looked better.
---
Nah, it would be kinda trashy and she already changed the name so I should move on lol
---
Great updated. Thank you. ‚ù§Ô∏è

Team with Frank, Primo and Mort; ok we should win

Primo: spawns as goalie

My game feels buttery smooth after the update, although I'm on Android

Yeah that‚Äôs what I felt as well

It used to be!! Tilted 30

indeed

I bought it yesterday.

Happy go lucky me

I was at 27 gems but I played a bit and got 6 in a box

Doesn't bother me. As long as i and other people can comprehend the pic, then your editing was fine.
---
Dw bout it
---
Dude bush check every bush when you go past them 
---
Wtf whyyyyyyy whyyy fuck this game thts legit the only mode i enjoy
---
how though
---
Still. It's annoying af.
---
The wife and I just moved to Germany and none of my computer stuff is here, I typically play and stream Fortnite and Smash Ultimate. I've been cooped up in a hotel for a little over a week now. With not a lot to do but play BS, so yea maybe you're right but I also almost have 200 solo showdown wins. So climbing hasn't been too much of an issue.

Good job!
---
Idk, with the new buff on darryl i think is worth, he could be strong
---
It's actually loaded rico
---
There was a small amount of brawlers with voices added
---
Great thing I saved 120 gems by buying early
---
Probably just allies
---
RIP BIRD BALLS
---
Incoming Genie to top spot in 2 weeks 
---
No because they regen same time, it just takes 24 hours now.
---
To make it up for nerfing him on his only good mode
---
I think you should just remove the timer in bounty all together, and replace it with a star target. First team to 30 stars wins, for example. This would promote much more aggressive play, and make it feel more like race to victory.
---
Wow Just in Time 
---
I wouldn‚Äôt buy any star power until i have all brawlers level 9
---
Worth it ?
---
Same, I'm so glad I bought the skin yesterday before going to sleep
---
Whaaat i thought it costed 80 gems in the dev diary, good thing i bought it yesterday
---
Oh god
---
She used to be garbage. If you‚Äôre OG like me there are a lot of oofs. At one point Thiccochet was shooting beach balls, his bullets were that big. Mortis was lunging like a lemur and Colt was King. 
---
Spike and Crow were always OP until recently. Spike‚Äôs still my baby and still the Queen 
---
Screw you gem grab
---
They removed it?
---
Sweet mother of hell
---
Well I guess the translators got creative. Here is Rich-ochet and in Spanish is Rico rico (Rich Rico)
---
Very cool I‚Äôm digging it too https://i.imgur.com/tHtWKdA.jpg
---
I swear that only happened once in 10 games ataround 300+ trophy range 
---
Yes....
---
Can you share his brawler desc/ unlock msg?
---
Teamwork for the win!
---
Yeah Maybe..
---
No i tried it 
---
It is back lol
---
I'm more amazed at your lack of Shop and Brawler notifications than anything else
---
Same with iPhone5s
---
Pam star power + this
---
Yup, guess that is the best idea, ty :)
---
Idk why but his range seems shorter
---
Wtf y?!! 
---
Maybe his attack effect changes?
---
And I'm currently uploading Gene gameplay in a few minutes!
---
I meant if u r alone with bots it is a bug,also thx for the tip with a friend!
---
worst make-up ever 
---
Nice job dude! This is pretty good!
---
I‚Äôm a a pretty bad crow player 615 was my highest with him after the nerfs, I don‚Äôt think he needs more dmg like before but he does need a hp nerf to keep up with all the damage buffs / healing buffs everyone‚Äôs gotten in the last few updates. 
---
Aww man I like the old ricochet design better, but the stat increase is great.
---
I don‚Äôt understand the whole ‚Äú???‚Äù And blank names for brawlers over 300 trophies
---
Use better WiFi 
---
Yes. It's a rare bug. Happpends rarely when you play duos showdown
---
The reason why i wrote the first comment was, that its quiet strange that they are adding a 3rd skin to a brawler while others have none. They shouldnt increase the upper limit while majority of brawlers have 0 or 1 skin only.
---
his losing animation is hilarious XD
---
Noooo I loved Life Leach üôÅ
---
I flaired it as humor
---
Removed. Keep your post titles descriptive and provide context. Additionally do not use low effort/all caps/clickbait titles.
---
Definitely agree, and there's nothing wrong with going with the tried and true, but it's a shame they didn't try something a bit different.
---
All signs point to Gene being a Mythic thankfully: https://redd.it/akprgz
---
yes they add it 
---
yeah he doesn‚Äôt seem like he‚Äôll be broken, honestly somewhat underwhelming but i could be wrong
---
Awesome!! Do you know the content of them?
---
Can someone tell me at least one good reason why they removed life leech
---
It was allready rare and provided at max 24 hrs of no teaming in showdown and acrual skilled gameplay
---
And yes tanks were pretty bad in it but they can allways play on other maps
---
#BringLifeLeechBack
---
In other news: Gem Grab player rate decreases by 62%
---
gem grab play rate drops to 0.
---
Of course ;) I will make a post
---
As I said it‚Äôs not the WiFi 
---
Today for me in the Northwest (new york/)  :p
---
Did you look at the post? It sAids mythic on it
---
a basic idea excecuted very well, i wish he had a scythe instead of pitchfork
---
Mega box worth it
---
Yay! Thanks a lot!!
---
I‚Äôm so excited! The update came out today and school got canceled today and wednesday. Time to brawl!
---
Why Life Leech gone?!
---
Super Cell likes black people (Hog Rider)
---
8 is the record I think
---
The skins I like the most are only 80 gems, Nice
---
....oofü§ß
---
im waiting for a someone to try to recreate Clash Royale in Brawl Stars now
---
I just couldn‚Äôt think of any reason that crow will be good at that time 
---
Lol.
---
Star Power seems a little OP. There isn‚Äôt even a range listed. It should at least behave similarly to Pam‚Äôs.
---
Will they be available for just a limited time? 
---
I also feel his attacks travel slower.
---
Reverting to OG Poco huh?
---
i still don‚Äôt know what thiccochet is, an upcoming skin?
---
Aloe neck
---
*does a 920¬∞ back spin*
---
Skin prices don't make any sense in this game. Why is Darryl cheaper than the others? No reason.
---
he was insane, top tier every mode, he charged super insanely fast and he was the fastest brawler (mortis had his speed lower at this point)
---
I have an idea Incase you like it
---
Like currently we have to collect 10 star token to unlock 1 big box 
---
We can (you can) and one more feature which is if you unlock 10 big box you receive 10 big tokens to unlock 1 mega box
---
Skins from the right column yes. Time to buy will be limited
---
Absolutely not, is not worth
---
HOW CAN YOU DO THAT
---
Hahaha, *I guess you're right*
---
It sounds pretty good compared to the others but it‚Äôs not lexs so everyone complaining (even me)
---
Holy fuck. I spent money on this game for the first time yesterday and bought golden rico because I knew this would happen. But I thought he would be only 80 gems. Thank god I didn't wait. I saved 120 gems!
---
It's a problem in their servers, happens to many players.
---
Than I'll buy that for my Darryl boi. Thanks
---
This is a common occurrence 
---
How do you do that?
---
Porn for bull
---
Disappointing
---
Solo showdown and a little bit of heist
---
I think the max levels only take effect if there is another person with you in the friendly game.
---
 Holy shit I was always annoyed by this but thought it was too small for the devs to change it! 
---
Omg thay happens so often to me tooüò™
---
He looks like thanos and big chungus had a baby
---
:((
---
Yeah it dose tbh but reddit loves his old hat XD
---
Have the 50 pack in the shop 
---
2 mega boxes
---
100 gems
---
2000 coins 
---
Nice im going to my Mortis and barley to 500 on that map the next time it comes on
---
This is incorrectly tagged ü•∫
---
right.
---
supercell , can you think before you do ?
---
I thought there is a luck factor that should be helping me :(
---
Yes. I want Gene ;)
---
I guess throwers can also do well because of all the walls they can abuse, but still, the tanky close-range brawlers can survive longer and can utilize their large health pools to survive and steal power cubes to grow in power, then hide in the bushes to ambush their prey as the poison fog slowly advances forward.
---
Big Chungus
---
thats me
---
Hopefully that's the issue.
---
Oh ok
---
Lecaron Lecaron
---
I miss old rico already. üò≠üò≠
---
I have the same problem!
---
Is android update cool 
---
I bought it weeks ago
---
Any opinion as to why?
---
Agreed that's why when YouTubers cast votes, everyone says sd is they're favorite. It's really just that no new players are good enough at gem grab yet (in my personal experience) to make it more fun and worthwhile. Same goes for bounty.
---
I don‚Äôt know. It does 166 per spike but it does 1 k if it direct hits. If it spreads out u won‚Äôt be able to hit all spikes on a desired target unless is spreads right in front. But maybe all the spikes combined is that same dmg before it spreads idk
---
He's made of glass.
---
I'm pretty sure he has the skin on his main account. Maybe this is his second or third account.
---
I feel u bro :(
---
#WELCOME BACK DYLANAWESOMENESS
---
Bought it for 30
---
It's my friends not mine
---
my heart is broken too ..
---
rico ? poco ? are you DERSTROY the game supercell??
---
And your still out of gems?
---
This is sick 
---
What‚Äôs funny is when he lost before, his arm fell off. Now his head just pops off.
---
Yeah because his a skelly and he could steal the sould of the dead hat :O
---
Same
---
You really got the worst of it man I'm at 5700 but I have 19 
---
Feelsbadman
---
Sorry, but whats a Life Leech?
---
Why the watermark?
---
And Jessie got a remodel as well
---
yes i have same problem 
---
Wow.. and I was proud of my 3m 12s. Which brawler you had?
---
Well now i need a POOP gene..üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
What phone are u using
---
Darryl is awesome
---
Lag and bad server connection is the worst thing about this game. Play CoC and CR and it's never been as bad as this game. I started playing at global launch and I've gotten the red WiFi symbol more times in that amount of time then over the 5 years that I've been playing the other games from SC. Terrible connection regardless of being on wifi or on 4G.  It's not my phone (note 8), it's not my internet as this happens regardless of wifi or on cellular data and every other app or game I run works just fine. Really takes the fun out of wanting to play this game. 
---
same problem for me too
---
But we knew this was going to happen, they're going to release it in the middle of the month like they said 
---
So boom roasted 
---
WTF WHERE DID LIFE LEECH GO IT WAS MY FAVOURITE I'M PISSED AF
---
Probably the first brawler made for gem grab
---
But Gene doesn't have to attack whereas Pam does :( seems op
---
Fear not we have Leon 
---
No way, that would be way too OP.
---
It could just be the name of robo rumble in the code
---
No he's nice
---
No like charge up just a bit üòÇ
---
I was playing Barley on Calamity Canyon. It was before the big boss was nerfed so heavily. Still, it was pretty hard. 
---
Nope. There are also other lines for RR
---
Good update. Been playing only since global so far so good.
---
However there needs to be some improvements still. 
---
1)Match making: power levels should be part of the math making system. I ranked up one of my brawlers Nita to level 19 with power 3 only and kept facing teams or people with everybody star power power 10.  Additionally global release players are behind those who have been playing this game for a long time so when the season resets is new folks who are near 500 trophies are getting ranked against people with way above 500 trophies. 
---
2)Solo show down teaming. There needs to be a damage over time automatic debuff if two or more players are on top of each other or really close to each other and the debuff should slowly do damage over time unless they attack each other or get apart. This will discourage team play in solo.
---
3)A non ranked trophy system. Sometimes you want to get into play with people to test out skills or simply just mess around. Obviously there will be no rewards earned but at least let us jump in and out of battles if we can only play for a few minutes.
---
4)Club feature. I'm in a very active club and it helps a lot to be able to form teams it's awesome. However sometimes you just want to log on just to browse or spectate but you get dozens of invites back to back. Trying to be considerate so I type in chat I'm just browsing now. However if a feature can be added where you can shut off invites or put an away message so when people invite you rather than be rude and hit ignore you can set an away message.
---
5) Another club feature. Being in a club should have additional perks. Give club members the ability to request power points on Sunday in exchange for coins similar to clash royale epic Sunday events. Also allow club members to trade power points for a specific brawler in exchange for other brawler points within the club also similar to clash royale trade system. 
---
Update looking solid hope to see some of the above added in the future. 
---
In the new January update I found that in friendly battles brawler are not maxed there are in the normal level without the star power.I just unlocked Tara and I wanted to try her star power in a friendly battle with some bots.I realized that her stats are the same as level one!Plz fiz it soon!
---
nice loool 
---
do not draw the new rico 
---
How come on super trivial stuff supercell employees respond but when it comes to gamebreaking discoveries or new content that the player base actually wants, we get crickets? You responded to another extremely trivial post but silence on way more important matters.
---
You didn't even give credit to the guy who uploaded it !!!
---
What a fake man
---
When is he coming? 
---
i got it too i think its crap
---
So are christmas skins.
---
wish you could play test him
---
In my opinion THIS is one of the best skins in the update. This skin along with the updated spike model and attack animations, its amazing. 
---
Pretty sure they don‚Äôt. 
---
What's the offer like?
---
It bugged out for a moment after waiting a couple minutes, but now it works. Thanks!
---
Gaymers
---
Thank you. Not made by me thougj. Shared freely for this subreddit
---
Ikr?
---
And his attack is so cool.
---
we want the hats !
---
Well I bought them, but other people have reported that it's the case
---
I‚Äôm the bringer of darkness!
---
Yes it did.
---
Ah, alright. Thanks!
---
BUT IT WAS ON SALE, I HAD TO BUY IT
---
Will they have like a ‚Äúpackage‚Äù for discounted skins?
---
I know. I meant I can't understand your view.
---
C'mOn uBi
---
Mines at level 7
---
He wasnt alive. You cant see him on the map and there wasnt that thing pointing at him if I cant see him on my screen. 
---
My mans has a pound of ground beef on his chest 
---
No. They are entered through the server manually.
---
Yes, but I don't recall the welcome pack. If I get the offer in the future it will be cool. Still got to buy the other 2 packs!
---
Only one time
---
You're welcome! 
---
Damn, the new level offers are garbage
---
Penny and frank came in late May and Leon in early December 
---
Replays only for brawlers 400+
---
It looks very well though
---
I can. Will be posting a video soon. He has some pretty cool mechanics!
---
Yeah same here sometimes it just crashes.
---
alright i guess i'll wait a bit longer and hope it reappers, thank you
---
would you say i have a big disadvantage compared to a friend who started playing at the same time and bought the lvl 35 offer? or isn't it that much of a deal?
---
That‚Äôs the thing though. Brawl Star characters aren‚Äôt made to look cool. They‚Äôre supposed to look goofy and ridiculous. It adds to the charm of the game
---
R/accidentalracism
---
Supercell is testing the repetitions with people of high trophies
---
If it makes you feel better, I am f2p and I payed 30 gems to buy rockstar colt, because i thought it would rise up in price
---
Thincochet
---
Oof
---
wut?
---
They are testing them out slowly calm down 
---
Your ratio of upvotes to time spent on your meme is astounding.
---
I got it last year thought it was cool now I get a return investment 
---
That's basically what life Leach was. You needed to do damage and get kills to stay alive
---
Play Gem Grab, Showdown, Heist..
---
They aren‚Äôt available over 400 either.
---
Depends on what you spend gems on. If you buy mega boxes or token boosters then you speed up your progression a little. But I only save gems for skins, personally.
---
Why do they have to test replays out? Like what could go wrong it literally just has to play a recording‚Ä¶
---
Yeah. Sorry
---
Guess again
---
Open your damn boxes
---
Yes. I agree
---
where?
---
His billets also break off into shrapnel if you miss.
---
Ah at least someone else noticed
---
So now green and yellow bushes are the same?
---
So you're a true golden Rico OG I see ;)
---
You‚Äôre the best Tid!
---
I noticed it right when i opened the game
---
I have this as well as christmas and lunar new year skin will never return in game. I love to be an OG (OB, sorry :))
---
It‚Äôs better than pams cuz of the range 
---
Lucky bastard

---
Okay.
---
Thanks dude. You‚Äôre the best as always 
---
yeah i read that still doesn‚Äôt seem that good
---
They haven't fully created the replay feature yet so it has "failed" hopefully soon there will be replays available. All we need to do now is just wait and give feedback when they do push it out.
---
ok
---
Well I am Level 83 and I still need gold, you must be maxing out very efficiently!
---
 haha yes  
---
Btw, I couldn‚Äôt even FREAKIN see the Tara in the bushes above. #MAKEBOGREATAGAIN
---
are the lunar ones limited?
---
I only saw one Pam in heist, in my team. She was utter garbage. But random gonna be random
---
Does it take a couple minutes for your phone to recover from the crash?
---
Yes
---
They said it would stay the same
---
Umm why did i see a pic in this sub with him costing 150
---
NO U
---
Not the only lmao. Duo Showdown and energy drinks too
---
We could re colour him gold imo
---
Play with somebody else and it's back to the old friendly.
---
Thanks! I'm not the best player, but I hope to be later on. This Barley isn't going to get itself to the leaderboard without practice. 
---
üòÇ
---
Maybe. Hopefully they will look into it soon. Because practice is how competition organizers and clans organise fair competitions
---
Upgraded to the king looking skin i forget the name tho
---
that did suck.. so moving the goalpost back is nice. but atleast people could spawn on either side of the post instead of inside it.
---
I think it rotates, because when there are no Morris anymore the throwers will dominate again and the tankers will disappear then it‚Äôs again mortis time. It is always the same rotation
---
I'm just triggerrd u have every non legendary brawler unlocked expect bo I have no leges, mythics or epics and got bo
---
It's broke 'cause it uses wired headphones.
---
Thank you for being obnoxious 
---
Not anymore, the reign of King Rico the 1st has just begun! Long live (or work) our new King!
---
That's what you get for runing bush-heavy maps
---
It's now loaded rico, which looks amazing
---
Kings dead

At least he got a voiceover.

Oh yeah yeah

Dude that‚Äôs an old clip

#\#BRINGBACKLIFELEECH
---
This is so sad 
---
I know, is that an problem?
---
^Agreed
---
I mean, there's leon, crow, bull, jessie, pam, primo, brock, and upcoming gene. Half of the brawlers in the game doesn't fit western theme. It is long abandoned.
---
Rico¬≤
---
Oh my god it‚Äôs literally roadhog down to his secondary fire
---
You have to outplay them instead of killing them. Lkke in real fotball
---
Finally they did this!
---
At 400 trophies
---
Anyone know if the lvl 50/75/100 offers come back if the deal expires?
---
0 Gems
---
BRING BACK LIFE LEECH
---
Na man I‚Äôm just saying 
---
But that isn't Spike, it's some weird guy with a hat and mustache.
---
No it was the most popular mod
---
Sweet.
---
The patch notes of the new update state that modifiers will only be available on showdown 
---
I think colt is looking a lot better now
---
If each spark deals 166 dmg at lvl 1 then how does it scale with lvl? 182.6 at lvl 2? 
---
Rule #1 of brawl stars: no decimal dmg cuz 9yos don‚Äôt understand that shit xd
---
Could you maybe make another post showing his star power, super range, and the damage his mini shots do?
---
Thanks
---
I thought it was easy to implement a Chinese firecracker or even more flames and effects to a rocket especially for lunar new year.
---
ALMOST HEAVEN
---
Lol that‚Äôs what I was thinking 
---
Supercell sure does hate hats, I wonder if they'll ever remove poco's hat
---
I'm crying rn
---
It‚Äôll be the GOATS of brawl stars (overwatch meta comp reference that works a lot
---
Like this would)
---
For brawlers at 400 trophies
---
Clutch !! 
---
It wasn‚Äôt. Basically no one played and it was trash
---
I like the old one more, they could make the remodel a new brawler instead
---
Absolutely agree.  
---
Damn that‚Äôs unfortunate. F for you brother
---
He got buffed.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt recommend giving tips when you‚Äôre only at 3k
---
But the new golden skin is better
---
Agree
---
Everyone forgetting wizard barley?
---
So sad
---
Makes sense.
---
Someone posted a pic of all the new skins compared to the old ones. Anyone have that link? I swear it was yesterday but I can't find the thread
---
How could I be playing more and open less boxes than you? I'm sure I've opened more boxes than you unless you've spent a lot of money on the game. I'm almost certain my account is bugged. There is often times when it shows that I have a bonus item in my chest and nothing comes. Literally just skips the item or gem or what it was suppose to be. I don't know why it does that
---
Great idea! I'd love to see this just like Tv royale in clash royale.
---
*[happines noise]*
---
No no no, you are wrong sir. 
---
Yes! From 10 to 50 FPS. Im feel so happy
---
Me too
---
( ‚Ä¢ÃÄ .Ã´ ‚Ä¢ÃÅ ) 
---
You can still only get the same amount of rewards from it in 24 hours though, so it really only helps people who play just one session a day.
---
They added replays but only if your brawler is at 400 trophies
---
Well, sounds like it is time to use that brawler. 
---
I've opened hundreds of boxes. And zero brawlers so far. I'm almost certain my account is bugged.
---
did anyone actually play on a new map yet?  
---
i played on and off all day but haven't seen a new map yet.
---
Thank you üòÇüòÇ
---
People like the new rico because of the loaded rico skin old rico without skin was cooler. 
---
Thanks man
---
Bruh just had a test on this in AP European history dude. Laughed at this good post 
---
I feel that if u have a wall breaker on your team it opens the goal up enough to where u can squeeze the ball in corners
---
Yep same here
---
Great another brawler I‚Äôll never unlock :(
---
I don‚Äôt have that kind of patience since this is not a maxed account. 
---
Maybe you could enter at more sides like the left side so you have to protect it more
---
I don't like Rico. The change makes me laugh. Cause I don't see the sense
---
Agent chief colt - 150 gems
---
Dragon dance brock - 150 gems
---
Dumpling darryl - 80 gems
---
Other skins:
---
Popcorn rico - 80 gems
---
Touchdown bull -80 gems
---
Serenade poco - 150 gems
---
Shouldn't you be in school kid? That grammar can use a little help :)
---
Maybe because he got a buff? Crazy thought, ik.
---
I know! Still exited for the new changes tho. 
---
Yeah, molt has the brock skin
---
You so smart 
---
Well, sure, but now I don‚Äôt have to play in the mornings again. Because having to spent time playing brawl stars before school/work just isn‚Äôt fun if you don‚Äôt have a lot of time. Now you don‚Äôt lose rewards when you don‚Äôt play so I think this is awesome :)
---
3k is good but as you say 5k at least if you ask me, btw i'm just 4300 so i shouldn't tell somebody how to do either
---
I know
---
Only if you have a brawler at 400 trophies you can see replays
---
Bencede
---
Honestly the transformation brawler will be GARBAGE. People already lack the mental capability to not suicide dive with 10 gems/7 stars or funnel gems into an actual gem carrier. Imagine casting transformation on a Bull while your actual Bull charges from behind you and starts showing that he is in fact the real Bull- and you are the fake. Your disguise will be broken by your allies and made useless.
---
Thank you Tid! You‚Äôre the best my man
---
Yeah sure,that's why you chose Leon as a flair(you IQ is low.Flair means side picture to name)
---
Flare? Like the ting yu ahoot into the ski?
---
It's  funny
---
Sorry if you don't like
---
Yeah, sry, my bad, but I don't think that it's a game changer
---
wtf bro
---
To push barley lmao
---
I guess ppl don't know he was nerfed in brawl ball, i saw 3 different ones in a row literally ruining the gamr because they tried to play like before
---
It was my fave
---
I bought it 2 days ago
---
Can you post some of the new music?
---
Oh no protect the waman. And lesbianboys apparently 
---
Wow my life has now higher quality!
---
Y O U  B R O K E  M Y  G U I T A R !
---
That is weird, I bought gold medalist ricochet to get loaded rico before the update.
---
El primos missing
---
Yeah.Sure
---
I like the new skin more.
---
Please don't hurt me!
---
Wasso wasso wasso wassUUUPPPP BEETCONEEEEEEEEECT
---
I knew kt i am highet iq
---
It makes sense though, say you just used piper for a bounty map and log out, when you log back in and accidentally press play you would‚Äôve been loaded into a gem grab map with piper rather than bounty 
---
YES! Now the Showdown Bulls won't ruin my games anymore!
---
how long did you have gold skin, cuz i bought mine yesterday and converted? ü§î
---
Yes pls
---
I got the new rico
---
What do you mean the new one looks 10 times better lol
---
Rico needs some love dude,come on
---
There‚Äôs 6 more offers that will be available soon so have your wallet ready
---
qwertzuiopasdghjklyxcvbnm
---
You thought rico
---
For about a week? Maybe not sure. Definitely before the update
---
But they got rid of life leach, soo....
---
You should get gene for FREE if they use this as an official profile picture of gene in-game! AMAZING fan art btw!
---
They were enabled with the update today
---
Love to see it ( i still got key boosters)
---
You are a legend
---
Ty, so when gene shoots you stand still?
---
Is it 400 trophies on any brawler or the one in the replay to have access?
---
Cuz he Looks like darryl And his gun is stubby
---
wow man thats extremely inconvenient 
---
It's in the game files, u/TID_NERDY datamined it.
---
no offense but brawler trading would be dumb imo, its different when you are trading cards, like in cr. But I do like all the visuals you made. 
---
No it doesn‚Äôt. Please let this be satirical
---
Well most phones nowadays have amoled displays lol
---
Yo how do you know? I‚Äôd like to see
---
I think Tid_Nerdy was just standing still. I don‚Äôt think he shoots like Frank 
---
How will the Brock skin fit he already has 3 ?
---
Probably also for Jessie and Nita
---
Wow! I‚Äôm loving the update but hav lots of bugs
---
For instance, in the middle of a game it just randomly crashes and sometimes just gets stuck
---
I love the victory/defeat animations of him
---
I dont like this offer at all üòÇ
---
His primary fire seems insane. The range is ridiculous, and that wide spread will be borderline impossible to dodge. If you can be hit by multiple fireballs after it splits, then holy wow that's op.
---
I agree!
---
I‚Äôm a little upset lmao. I just wanna know why.
---
I like brawl ball more now
---
Thicco wins
---
100 offer looks pretty bad...
---
That's what i'm doing right now haha
---
Well, not anymore
---
I used a trick where I saved 150 gems!!!!  By not using my premium currency on cosmetic BS.
---
Yeah but use him on solo showdown ffs if you don't know how to use him,or practice with bots, like i tried to push barley and I couldn't because of rico... (but he *T H I C C* )
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/akz9m7/comment/ef987nd?st=JRHZJNMA&amp;sh=ee757711
---
So how do u buy older skins that get replaced?
---
thanks
---
F
---
r/thathappened
---
Thanks! Just credit me and you can use it!
---
*Update with a disliked skin redesign drops*
---
u/The_Dog_Rules *posts the old design as a new concept*
---
Fastest ~~revolver~~ skin designer in the west
---
They already are, you just need a brawler with more than 400 trophies 
---
I love Gene, he looks so cute!
---
What?
---
Have you found any info about the lunar new year event?
---
Best Brawl Stars art üñº ever. Such colour and movement. Amazing. You win buddy 
---
Can someone tell me if we get another opportunity to buy these after missing them the first time in shop?
---
Thank ya 
---
Having the same problem here
---
not for everyone only those who have a brawler over 400 trophies
---
Tara has nothing in her cards, it could be improved
---
Nice regular show refrence
---
Interessante, Mas N√£o Seria Melhor Postar Em Ingl√™s?
---
The new skin is so much better lol, and the name is also better
---
Do you have a youtube channel?
---
That's right. 
---
sakura spike imo
---
Im gonna calling him gilbert tbh
---
They will take away the amount of gem your bought. 
---
They already keep track of it to obviously hand out star player, it infuriates me every time I want to see the stats and they just don‚Äôt show you for no reason.
---
I know, but they didn‚Äôt re-center it after they changed his name 
---
Yes they are, but only when u r playing frdly with frds not bots
---
Just when you play alone, when there are more players you'll be maxed
---
I will buy that one too. Just wondering if there were anymore tiers of deals when you hit a certain level in the game.
---
Thank you Supercell. My Gem Grab gameplay is about to drop by 99% cause it's the worst mode. 
---
how does it feel to be wrong?
---
How it feels to be stupid?
---
Still pretty misleading description
---
Yeah. It sure is. Before my character was moving slower because of the lower FPS 
---
Why did they change him?? I liked the original the best :(
---
Mortis is not buffed, he is nerfed, green ball drops were better
---
And than? I gez negative gems or what
---
i guess being wrong is just in your nature huh
---
Elimined data
---
Not 100% sure though
---
i guess being stupid is just in your nature huh
---
Perfectly balanced
---
In italian: Stecca. STECCA! What a bad name guys 
---
This is awesome finally! However why only brawlers over 400 cups? I think low Level guys would get the most benefit from watching their replays seeing what they could do better. 
---
Its already updatet lmao
---
Upvote to you
---
Welp I was wrong. I was going to buy it but now it‚Äôs 150 gems
---
How do you like the changes so far? Glad they got rid of the space behind the goal but it's silly that people spawn in the goal. I feel like the death timer needs to increase or they should spawn in the corners.
---
Can you announce if his star power will change? 
---
Clubs are still irrelevant in my opinion
---
this is a joke ok, but its epic
---
Try 8 months. I got my last mythic in May and didn‚Äôt get my first legendary until a couple weeks ago. And the best part? It was the Leon offer. I didn‚Äôt even get it out of a box. My legend chance was .29
---
He grown up xD
---
They are obviously going to have a discount
---
Great! Thanks for the info.
---
Sound.
---
Content creators got 1 skin earlier
---
The 100x option would be the best!
---
I care. Don‚Äôt assume lol.
---
How it feels when I‚Äôm dating your mum?
---
Nothing but salt!
---
Based off the Wheaties box, made it in Photoshop.
---
Was kinda fun. Might make more.
---
What bug
---
This looks fun and intresting
---
I was so looking forward to play this game mode again :(
---
I feel you man. I‚Äôm in the same boat.
---
Was playing as Barley bc Dyna is at 500. Barley is at 460ish, and we had 7 dynamikes, 1 barley, and 2 primos. One of the primos was surrounded by probably 5 dynamikes, died within a second or so. 
---
It was beautiful. 
---
I think they should just hand the game over to you to perfect it tbh.
---
Ugh you win Supercell. Finally time to empty my wallet and get those Poco and Rico skins
---
It‚Äôs in the patch notes
---
Woah! Great work everyone (shakes everyone's hands) 
---
Damn, that looks unfinished. I hate you for pointing that out. Now i can't unsee it.
---
i‚Äôm not trynna argus with you on this, but i‚Äôm majoring in journalism and i write for a living. ‚Äúsince‚Äù is only used when talking about time. ‚Äúi haven‚Äôt seen you since last week!‚Äù 
---
feel free to look it up if you‚Äôd like. 
---
The location settings
---
I was missing 2 gems ONLY 2 andd just before the update a miracle happened and I got the gems and bought the skin thinking I saved 50 gems and the skin will look awesome,150 was not what I expected
---
Great now I gotta get one up above 400
---
If you don‚Äôt use walls then you shouldn‚Äôt be playing rico tho...
---
U too :)
---
Whaaaaaat! Lol wtf??? How did I not know?
---
Thinoche ?
---
Level up offers have no gems. Worthless.
---
Doesn‚Äôt really rhyme...
---
Will we still be able to buy the welcome pack if we've been playing for a while?
---
I think supercell ruined trading with CR, but sharing replays would be nice.
---
I know it will come eventually but there's a lot of potential in club wars which I'm excited for.
---
*Pinochet
---
No. This offer is for beginners only.
---
Excellent - didn't catch that.
---
I hate the doodoo bug
---
How are u able to change the game files to enable him?
---
I had 29 gems then the maintenance break came
---
This thursday.

It's cheaper to buy one :D

there is no one yet. I want to create in
---
Oh, I see.
---
Yeah I hate that too I am currently at 6300 trophies and I don‚Äôt have any legendary. But I save some accounts that‚Äôs only have 700 cups and have crow

---
It wasn't so special :/
---
He added it to the post
---
You were killed by shelly
---
That was huge!!!! 
---
Colt x piper
---
Assuming you hit them all. I mean, colt can 2 shot, should *he* be nerfed?
---
Hooray
---
dude compare it to new years. New years costs half as much, and although lacks 500 gold, also has like 70 more gems so it has much more value and costs less. I mean I can be biased too as I'm level 49 right now but the offer is pretty bad.
---
Wth this is my discord and gaming username Cyro lol
---
It means no one has Leon in Greenland 
---
The lvl. 50 pack is in my shop now so... 
---
At the moment 3 vs 3. There are no mechanics in the game that will allow to play a lot of players.
---
You need to understand that all I show is a prototype. He may change 100 times.
---
Damn this is insane! Not sure how the bomb could be incorporated into his attack but it would be awesome to see if they could
---
Credits already watched a ton of times, but nice try
---
Oh fuck... I can already see those grabs on Shelys with ults
---
I prefer old Jessie. Jessie now looked like an 8 year old
---
The old Rico looked like a badass. The new one is, I don‚Äôt know, just too childish
---
Rico's one shot is sometimes be two shoots. For example heist he shoot the wall and big box(i dont now a good english) he can give 2x damage 
---
Where is my life leech? üò¢
---
Does anyone know if we can start saving boxes to get gene when he is released?
---
1800*ish.*
---
Got pretty lucky too, almost every unlockable character aside from piper and the legendaries, only been playing since a few days after global launch though.
---
Yea(
---
I saw you drew it but we already know by then we were getting thiccochet? 
---
Thanks for the feedback :). Excited to try him out!
---
Nearly 2000 trophies in a little over a month? Pretty good if I say so myself. As long as you have one or two team mates with common sense you‚Äôll make it far
---
Gene‚Äôs star power is illegal
---
yup but not the bubblegum machine thing just that one image of the bot that everyone edited
---
Alternatively, they could have just made it so a mod spawns on both sides of the map at the same time (or they alternate)
---
???
---
rico is a gumball machine
---
But the game now does not lag at all
---
My heart goes out to those that spent 30 gems on his skin. 
---
If you play with friends, your brawlers are fully upgraded, when you play only with bots, you have your normal level
---
Not necessarily, knives - in this case CSGO knives are depleting in value. Though some can be sold for a huge profit margin via private sites you're not at all going to be able to 'sell it back whenever to make more money' - behind the Valve Tax and Supply / Demand there's no way you have a 100% chance of getting your cash back.
---
Also stop bagging out people for using an emoji, the only thing that makes it cringey is people like yourself complaining about it. 
---
It's not guaranteed, but the more boxes you have to open, the better your chances get. You can watch some videos on YouTube of content creators opening hundreds of boxes to try and get Leon and some never got him. So...it's not guaranteed. 
---
for the hundredth time on this subreddit its not a bug 
---
That‚Äôs coach Cory, Brawl Stars youtuber 
---
If we shouldn't ask for character i am sorry supercell
---
According to the probability you should open like 1000 boxes to find them, if you‚Äôre lucky you‚Äôll get them whit less boxes, if you‚Äôre unlucky you won‚Äôt get them
---
mythic* and just keep playing i got 17 bralwers in 2 weeks 
---
Hey, seems like a fair trade.
---
Whoosh.  You do realize I was referring to the ease of consistently placing high in the mode? 
---
He‚Äôs legendary. He is supposed to have great stats. There is no ‚Äúop‚Äù
---
Did u find any problems when switching to lunar new year theme? My app closes automaticly when i do so.
---
What did u do to make this
---
Since the update today, the game lags very hard. I also heard that from 3 Friends. Not cause of the internet, there is no wifi symbol 
---
But the brawler is unable to move for a few seconds and if you strike with your superskill in that time nothing happens except that the superskill is out of power. 
---
No, i don't have any problems with that, try reinstalling the game.
---
Been relying on randos so far, but yeah i'm pretty proud of where I am right now. Only been playing about 15ish mins a day, maybe an hour or so every often. I use bluestacks a lot, which helps get high rank in showdown since my aim with a phone isn't stellar.
---
You shouldn‚Äôt expect a rarer brawler by 1700 trophies. Just keep playing.
---
Lmao don‚Äôt judge I made it when I was 11
---
The heck?
---
But only for brawlers with 400+ trophies. I don't get why we cannot just watch out replays regardless of trophies. I have had some awesome plays that I wish I could replay 
---
Yep. My bad.
---
Yeah, exactly. Time Limited Offer vs Always in the shop offer.
---
thx for leaking   about  everything man
---
I agree, I think that spawning in the goal is ridiculous as even after wiping a team out you can still easily be stopped from scoring a goal. I also don‚Äôt like that passing uses up an attack. Flawed as it was, I definitely prefer the old brawl ball.
---
wtf i am 4100 and no mythic or legendary 
---
so the Problem is mine 
---
Buff leon?
---
Wow. I asked brawl stars support a few months back. "Are u guys allowed to give out anything in game?" Their response was that they can't give anything to anyone as they don't have those tools.
---
Yes im lagging and the Game crashes too 
---
Me 2! #FixBrawlStars
---
But u have epics
---
#FixBrawlStars
---
tf mate
---
It's equal tho,both teams have the same(average)trophy level

go to where there is 3 dots and go to change flair... if your on mobile 
---
I was talking about the lvl 50 one
---
I hate the voice acting for Mortis, as well as poco.  Ugh
---
You have 2 star powers. Your team is better. Please dont make the subreddit with this kinda posts.
---
... "Because I play on emulator &amp; I-phone- XS"
---
When will the lunar one be in store?
---
I opened Leon... not complaining though lmao
---
Looks like the technology is finally there
---
looks like the Brawl Stars team is taking a page out of Clash Royale's book by now doing offers that have special offers that include less gems than the original shop prices! Disgusting 
---
It isnt equal. This boy's team was better. Look! 2 star powers against 1
---
Lol why‚Äôd you downvote me for answering your question
---
lol
---
Filter 
---
so as i had no idea i went and tried to check these guys, i understand now. this argument was dumb and i apologize for it.
---
I prefere thiccochet 
---
He did not come in peace.
---
But now he rests In peace. 
---
Old Shelly looked hilarious
---
Dude, I mean, Tara looks super unpolished, she needs a complete revamp of her model
---
Yes, is imposible to score a goal
---
Actually, the replays are only available for the brawler that is over 400.
---
It saved for me before the update
---
Supercell hates hats 
---
***Do you think I should play with them?! I wanted to go to Heist with players with 380 trophies, not with 500+ &amp; Star Power! ***
---
Thats a bad? ü§î
---
True but 3 of my friends have mythics
---
and my brother got crow at 900 he is 1300 now 
---
But Yeah
---
I know i got frank i while ago and Piper 2 days ago 
---
But but WTF MAN Everybody at my trophies have at least a mythic 
---
Yeah lmao
---
Is this a random person post or YouTuber or supercell person I don‚Äôt know if this is real 
---
They not only changed their stance but also polished a lot his model
---
No I don‚Äôt think so, I can score quite regularly.
---
I think they reduced thehit box size of getting the ball when your closer to your goal as I‚Äôve been able to shoot through two brawlers standing close to each other at their goal
---
This isn‚Äôt on the dev build. It‚Äôs likely supercell reached out to the most notable brawl star YTs and asked them what skin they would want for free.
---
Proof: [Watch starting at 0:40](https://youtu.be/GorGjkWonJA) 
---
NICE I CAN‚ÄôT BUY ANY OF THEM
---
Anyway, I was unnecessary on this team. Would be better if the game gave randoms with 380+.
---
Dont mess with god Thicochet
---
Same dood thiccochet is best
---
If I were you I did not care about it yet, it will take about 2-3 months to have the next remodelings
---
Amazing map the looks so fun to play in good work op
---
Dont mess with Thicochet
---
I think they need to reduce the spawn time
---
I feel ur pain... my bro got mortis and pam at 600 and piper at 1000. No epics since i got darryl (a month ago) and no mythics or legendaries
---
Im –Øussia–ò. Rush BBBerlin, sukablyad!
---
Well it's an idea for a _skin_, they've had many skins where they have hats on.
---
I feel like the more trophies u have, the less ricos there are
---
They should add a confirm button for buying chests...
---
I‚Äôm willing to sign üñäüìã
---
Its the oppisite for me, they fixed it. Maybe you have an older device, or you may be getting connected to people in other regions that are a great distance away.
---
At least 40$ is what I‚Äôd pay.
---
How do u make these
---
Support doasnt have the right to do that, also dont be a selfish Child, they got It becouse they are youtubers
---
You can stop playing if you are going to cry like this.. Its just a normal matchmaking.. 
---
Same here
---
Oh, well back then it was extremely devastating on the offense or defense lol not surprised it was nerfed 
---
Don't take it personally. If you don't like it, then so be it;  I can't force you to like it.
---
Btw, I'm old enough to use a phone, if that answers your question.
---
Can you tell me how to get this
---
Out of all brawlers who got model change your going on about colt, the most polished of the lot, why not go on about rico
---
So only youtubers get test acc?
---
It's happening to some other people, i think it'll be fixed soon
---
It destroyed in the whole circle, now it‚Äôs only in the center lol
---
\^ this
---
That‚Äôs weird cause I can‚Äôt view anyone else‚Äôs but the people over 400 
---
No but It looks fire
---
That is nerfing for ya
---
Do u know if these skins will be discounted like with the Christmas skins and the recent dynamike and skins. If so do you know for how much they will be discounted
---
30 gems is cheap though, you can get that easily from opening your boxes.
---
Hmm... No 
---
He's going to get a remodel. Like every other re-model, he will be fixed, polished and get more details.
---
Hopefully, in the next update, but, not sure.
---
Removed. Rule 3. No providing information on how to break Supercell Terms of Service.
---
Look up some og videos of her, it was devastating 
---
I don't care about rico , just Cold my best one 
---
I care
---
It‚Äôs like 1 in 450 so, in 450 boxes?
---
kinda unlucky u didn't get loaded rico...
---
It has the greatest impact on a match so it had to be nerfed
---
I am definitely buying the 80 gem default one
---
Nerf gene 20 
---
I agree with you friend 
---
I played since beta launch, didn‚Äôt get one till a month ago
---
Amazing, yet again! Could you make Poco by any chance?
---
You should call him ricochet
---
happening to me as well...
---
every 4-5 matches the game crashes and I need to restart  
---
and pray I¬¥m not dead by the time I¬¥m back.
---
Hasn¬¥t happened once before the update
---
No, not only YouTubers. Still game developers, moderator Reddit, BrawlStats.com developer and other close people
---
y u do this to life leech
---
by far the best mode
---
Heh
---
and i bought it for 30 two days ago lol
---
This
---
I‚Äôm still getting it even at full price
---
Is it Buff crow?
---
I'll make it some day.
---
Gives me a reason to actually play
---
Someone has already done this!? Damn
---
what if you have that brawlers attack and super too but it last for a limited time.
---
dang i would pretend it was a lawnmower back then
---
If you make him smile, I will think it is sans again...
---
I‚Äôm 20 and I wanna buy one bczI never had one and it looks fun 
---
Yeah, something weird this time. It stops the game completely. Typical lag stutters your movement. This is different. It happens once in a while and the whole game is frozen for a few seconds (although I haven't crashed yet).
---
:) that‚Äôs good! Do you know who you are going to make next?
---
Thanks for making it 
---
Might be Malaysian or Singaporean, idk
---
It's a secret. Please look forward to it!
---
What do you use to access the game files?
---
nice! brawl on :D
---
Yeah
---
We just need a construction frank skin
---
tried it like 5 times already still the same 
---
what device are you playing with
---
I can play my this game for an hour before I get bored then wait half an hour then I can play again
---
Eat a borger
---
Try opening the game from the app store and wait a few seconds
---
False.  The majority of people don‚Äôt hide and will all usually die before you succumb to the poison guaranteeing a positive trophy placement even at the highest trophy levels, you would just hide and take long range pot shots occasionally for health. Like I said I‚Äôve pushed brawlers to 700 doing this in little time, it was an easy mode to cheese for cups if you knew what to do and I imagine that‚Äôs why it was removed.  Not sure why people who don‚Äôt even know about this and have been playing the game a month feel the need to argue 
---
No problem, glad you appreciate my hard work on developing brawler stars. /s
---
- random person 
---
Congrats man, i am still 750 trophies away...
---
Wowie
---
Ok! I‚Äôll be waiting~
---
that icon is horrible, makes him look like a vampire
---
