Nice you copied overwatch

Alright who wants to play? Ill glady join the game

Same feels bad

Solo showdown

Oh ok

You know what time it is
---
Siege is a great way to get a lot of trophies and also lose a lot of trophies easily
---
Yep

Basically what I do all the time in FoF

I would rather go with jesse but I guess tara will help in the future

Is the date real? 28th? because they said they'd bring carl in mid march didnt they? Nice for sharing this bro

If they give me 150 Leon power points... Ill be the happiest man on earth
---
Well, we HAVE been asking for better free stuff in the shop. It's nice to know that Supercell doesn't ignore the community.
---
RIP Mortis
---
1.4/1.5 - 1 = 6.67% (rounds up to 7%)
---

---
DPS is calculated based on the amount of damage a brawler can do in a certain period of time. By allowing Crow to attack more times per minute, his total damage during that timespan has increased. 
---
Bruh someone hire this man
---
I hope they chucked their phones into their computer screens and they bounced back into their faces
---
how could you stop teaming?
---
Thanks :)
---
This would be perfect if only they didn't remove his bandana
---
i just see penny jessie tbh
---
This is actually pretty cool
---
I‚Äôm glad I could helpüëçüèº
---
They ended up stating in the QnA they needed a little longer to work on him and he‚Äôd be released later in the month
---
A showdown alternative: keep trophies as they are, but adjust the powering up in game. 
---
Like now, allow players to open boxes for more power. But...
---
...add more incentive for players to shoot each other. For every time a player discharges their super (after the first?) they get an extra reload. Or their reloading happens slightly more quickly. 
---
Players will shoot each other for a shot (pun intended) at an advantage later on. And if they shoot each other cooperatively, to charge supers more quickly? A non-teamer has a better chance of taking them out while they are injured. 
---
Yes please, nerf Pam!
---
Where did you get this? 
---
Do you make videos of you making these?
---
Or showdown. I just played SD for the token and got 34 for first
---
Repost
---
Yes but I put it on Tuesday and take that on a brawl page
---
Good idea
---
When is Carl coming out?
---
Not how it should work but it is how it works
---
Idk but robo rumble is in a few hours imagine how much boxes you can get with 610 gems if u buy a lot of tickets and token doublers you could probably unlock at least 2 brawlers
---
Sure they do. Specially if you are already where they spawn.
---
Lol, was try to get help after the latest update I have very intense lag.
---
it is very difficult to get gems, so much that it is possible to maximize an account without being able to buy all the clothes for the brawlers. Are you going to solve this?
---
*stat increasing green things

cool

Exactly, so that's why we lose

Mines is at 401 at level 1 ( not tryna flex) I pushed him this far by playing duo showdown with randoms try not to be too aggro until there are 3 teams left so you got nothing to lose.

‚Ä¢Range is Poco's but its the same width as Nita's.

Super: Inferno(Launches his whole ranges worth of fire, the fire will damage enemies every second they are in it. Deals 430 damage and last 3sec.)

‚Ä¢Star Power: Mini Tikis(Spawns 2 mini Tikis that attack the same as Kanaloa but have 2000 health. Spawn after Kanaloas initial attack)

Have you been doing these for months and just now releasing them once a day, or do you release them the day you finish?

Pongan un trowher legendario les pongo mi sugerencia: un yeti que lanze bolas de nieve que bajen la velocidad de movimiento y su starpower hiciera que tambien bajara la velocidad de recarga y su ultimate fuera como la de brock pero que congelara a todos a los que les de

*PROCEED TO LOOK IF POWER IS THE SAME*
---
This isnt good, becouse piper gonna be snniping other players in other islands
---
I showed him your comment in particular and the suggestions I made to it and he agreed to the concept we created. He also said he was thinking about having piercing as a star power but felt that it would be useless since most brawlers don‚Äôt line up in the first place

2 accounts and u succ, stop using autoaim

You'll never get Crow if you abuse Crows
---
The water mark is right there. Search it up on YT 
---
Yeah I just feel like a passive super may seem good until you actually play as him. Maybe its a shield but it reflects damage or it could be a more powerful stab, but that's kind of generic. Another idea is that he summons an undead viking like Tara's star power but its his super, but thats like Nitas bear so maybe ita ranged and has a bow. Not sure, supercell took all the good ideas.
---
Lmfao bet
---
You first. 
---
This is more disgusting than the videos of 10 people teaming in solo sd
---
r/crowgang lol
---
You missed the hands.
---
But it's so realistic tho. Its like as if you grabbed a real crow and gaved it a sweater 
---
Yes since his Dps increased by 7%
---
What you say, you have to give the reason to the silly, a legendary with that level is little.
---
r/woooosh
---
Can we expect any other buff/nerf for other brawlers with the release of Carl in the game
---
Is there a way to remove the delay you get because i know its not just me since my friends also get it and even some youtubers do. Can you possibly find a way to remove the delay and lag
---
This needs to be incorporated 
---
Not like the are super hard to get or anything 
---
Oh cause I play 500-700s and it‚Äôs not like that randoms or no randoms
---
Haha thanks, drawing is much more difficult than I anticipated but thank you for the compliment 
---
Yeah. I'm sad.
---
What is you're IGN( in game name)?
---
No I have him at power 7, I just really like his mechanics, and he was my 3rd brawler to 500 trophies
---
I have noticed that the brawler drop rates seem to stop at an extent making it hard to get brawlers. I understand that no one should have a 100% drop rate but I think the maximum percent for all drop rates should be higher. Also, I recommend BUFFING CROW (joke)
---
This really depends on rng, sometime I get 1st place on accidentally because the last two player kill each other.
---
U have negative karma bro, and yeah save leon
---
Yeah fr it's super difficult. My suggestion is that you should always finish a drawing if you start it, and add as many details as you see to your own drawing. I have a very limited experience with drawing but those are my suggestions for you
---
everyone does. 
---
Id like to see free gems

Finally a decent brawl ball map

Best free deal ever
---
Does anybody else just accidentally stand still and do nothing even after the stun ends?
---
Thanks, hope that I can complete this before the end of the year
---
You can also use sniping brawlers like piper and brock tho, so it is reasonably ok
---
I got Piper...
---
But I never use her
---
You see that HUGE red button on the right side of the screen?
---
You can also just tap on him to kick him
---
You saw how the crow player kept spinning for his so called friend after the first goal? He obviously approved the behavior of his clan mate, if that doesn't seem like a good enough reason for a tempban...
---
Like I mean come on, if you are going to do this shit, at least try to make it not so obvious 
---
Maybe a Shield that bounces projectiles back?
---
So... mccree?
---
The point is to strategically destroy the grass to stop tanks

That‚Äôs what the piper gets for not playing again with me ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Can yoyU PLZ GIve me some shelly advice and tips...
---
How about a report button and only give it to people who have replays unlocked with their brawlers, that way you could only focus on high level gameplay &amp; maybe the report button can only be used after that certain game is over and have a option button on what to report them by i.e. Teaming , Afk , Feeding ?? 
---

When is Carl getting released? 
---
Hey guys! More of a technical question here: how do you guys work? You probably use agile or some sort of that framework, but do you guys work on squads? Tribes? Could you describe a little bit?? ü§©ü§©
---
So true
---
This also assumes that you are constantly attacking as soon as you reload and landing all of your daggers.  Even if you did, the poison effect does not stack.  His actual damage output increase is a decent amount less than 7%.
---
Disgusting, that's a freaking ban right there
---
Lmaoo
---
Me too, but on my experiences, Piper is trash! SO I WASTED IT!!!!!!!!!!
---
Good point. I wish they would allow the damage to stack. 
---
so piper and rico made el primo? hMMMM
---
I got free 150 power points for penny
---
If Ur making a private version of portrait I would legit buy it
---
Use her on maps with lots of tanks. So Feast and Stormy Plains are good places to use her on
---
schrodinger... 
---
I did to, but I think Piper isn't that great, because I can counter her, So I wasted it!
---
R E V O L U T I O N A R Y

your correct

NEXT UP:   
---
yolooo!!
---
Honestly yeah that‚Äôs an interesting thought, kinda forgot about that whole grass change.
---
I've been playing Penny for quite a while, I just reach star power. I just feel like she's not that strong as I thought she would be, everyone who plays penny would understand what I'm talking about, not just her states kind of suck but also her star power and reload speed.  So please Supercell takes this as a  consideration on buffing Penny thanks :D.
---
Can I get an f in chat for how much time this must have taken 
---
I just unlocked Tara earlier today and got them for her :)
---
Super happy to have her at power 4 already
---
In my experiences, i think im good at Piper
---
i hate to tell you this but since the very first comment from the other guy, it‚Äôs been a troll. we know you don‚Äôt have instagram. please don‚Äôt call gediecor. 
---
That is what usually happens but some people just don't have the motive.
---
Look at T Series they just crying for their momma
---
Nice
---
You do know there's an international men's day too. 
---
how many trophies
---
I have no idea.
---
Yet i can‚Äôt get any 500 brawlers... GG tho I am impressed 
---
Angry robot works in duo, but in solo, while it stops some teaming, ur fucked if your a solo player who has 5 or less power cubes plus it ruins endgame
---
I knew I saw some1 else with mcree in this skin. Never even thought of Erron Black from mk, good spot!!
---
I respect this aspect of looking at it.
---
That‚Äôs me 
---
definitely not true
---
Some people have played about 1 year and they didnt have unbox a legendary, so if you want to check ur legendary chance go to shop &gt; click on a brawl box &gt; in the left corner theres an "i" click it and you will see ur legendary chances along with thr others rarity drop

Dear god finally.

Will there ever be a deathmatch gamemode in which the one with most kills wins? (and you can respawn) 
---
They're not in the same clan the person throwing isn't good enough yet to join main tribe band which the other team is in  
---
I'm a top a player too in the main tribe band and the idea of wintrading is as ineffecient as it is stupid. 
---
Add Will Smith face and Will be perfect+
---
23, in solo tho ):
---
Innocent until proven guilty. Ban the game-thrower for a good amount of time (6 months to indefinite imo), but don‚Äôt ban the other team until we get evidence that they have a part in this. 
---
There is no animal brawler though, each one is a man, woman, or robot. The ‚Äúanimals‚Äù are humans wearing animal-like attire
---
I mean I got Leon at 700 trophies. 
---
Btw i taking screen shots the whole time and posting in a discord server  i was thinking either they're really stupid or they're just trolls
---
I totally agree
---
sorry

Shhh.... he knows his place.

More Like heist in my opinion but good

Could you please make a custom control button so you can move the controls around. The attack and alt is to close together, i have many times where the attack button is under the alt button instead of activating my alt. Thanks

---
Super happy, I unlocked Piper and my power points went to Tara, so I got her to level seven
---
If it was innefficient people wouldnt do it. There are multi million dollar websites for league of legends that have rosters of wintraders that boost accounts. If it was inneficient this wouldnt be the case

Meteor heist was fun, change my mind
---
Nerf bull lol. No way he is serious
---
I completely agree. I've had this happen multiple times to me where I was on opposing end of the throw and it was usually because a person was my good friend just playing with randoms and messing around or it was someone who was trying to get on my better side to play w me in the future. 
---
I'm in the main tribe band so Ik that's definitely not wintrading
---
It was difficult to not let that happen to me too haha
---
It's the same situation when one of them arrives at Rank 20.
---
Lmao ikr
---
Yeah, i got Spike yesterday and i play Spike the whole day

It‚Äôs what the big clan in clash royals was doing, forgot their names

This isn't league of legends. And it isn't win trading
---

---
If you want to amount of time, I‚Äôve started this challenge around 6 months ago. The account in the screenshot took about 2-3 weeks of grinding. That may seem like a lot but with experience with pushing, it‚Äôs not as bad as you think.
---
Yea ik i have crow even with that. Its not worth it. Its beeter to use someone else
---
What about as an additional download? You have the choice whether to download it or not
---
I pushed my poco from 500 to 600 in duos wih randoms at 9.5k total trophies dk what ur talkig about. And ur losing trophies cuz ur playing wih randoms. Play with friends instead, no friends? Then delete the game
---
I think his damage output is awesome because he doesnt let you heal for triple the time but he is way to easy to kill imo. I think he needs a health buff and thats it
---
Bruh new brawler leaks!
---
*Your time has come*

Lol

I miss Sapphire Plains....

Snake Plairie of Gem grab

night with mortis is scarier

I think you meant this comment for someone else?

and what do you got in return just 546 upvotes....huh
---
so much fortnite players here i guess.
---
How to end teaming step one: team
---
You realise there are people out there with max accounts and over a hundred thousand coins therefore when a new legendary brawler comes out they can get it straight away
---
That leon was pretty bad lol
---
About 30-45 accounts. I was thinking about putting them all in a club but I was to lazy to do that lol, would look pretty cool now that I‚Äôm thinking about it.
---
But sad for his own trophies..
---
That's some insane amount of pp for pam
---
Win Trading needs to be Stopped ! It‚Äôs worse then Teaming in Solo Showdown ! 
---
The hardest draw imo is in heist where both of you destroy the other's safe at the same time
---
Yes just ignore it please.
---
The most spectatular part was that you aimed your super where Spike was headed **before** he started to move. This madlad can predict the future!
---
^(tracer skin confirmed)
---
The game gives you powerpoints for your highest rarity female brawler from what ive seen
---
SeeP wITh tHe FiShEs!
---
Wow. That was really a heart stopping moment O.O
---
On a sidenote: Since this replay is a really good content, why not crosspost it to /r/BrawlStarsClips too? You even get extra ~~worthless internet points~~ karma by doing that!
---
Damn and my level 7 colt has been stuck at 380 trophies for a month
---
That's why we don't auto aim our super kids!
---
But the offer does not come in shop right away. It might take a few months 
---
Its litterally wintrading
---
It‚Äôs scary how skilled you must be to do this... (I understand how sarcastic that sounded but I‚Äôm deadass.)
---
Props to you for giving free #1s to random showdown players lol
---
EXPECTATION: 30 POWER CUBE BULL GETS KILLED BY 0 POWER CUBE SHELLY WITH SUPER

Well imma attempt

 It cya in my grave

---
There's a leave button for you üôÉ
---
Can someone why my luck with the legendaries is like 1%? 
---
*monkey noises*
---
40k in this game is a lot if you compare to CR where some chest can have 3k+ in them, I think the max gold you can have is around 500-700 in a mega box
---
You said that you betray. So you most likely team to gain their trust and betray them later
---
Congratulations first of all. And personally I'm okay with crow, a buff will be nice but I dont think crow needs a buff.
---
MaDe WiTh MeMaTiC
---
Damn son haha. Which region are you based in?
---
increase the number of star tokens needed to get a big box. i included this in my comment explaining the post
---
Is this *LIMITED EDITION*?
---
Thanks
---
Oh yeah I forgot
---
Why changed Ricochet? before his appearance was justified because he was a soldier and that enters the context of the game as it is old west and mexico
---
No I mean betray them right away. Colt and spike kill every brawler in three or four shots
---
Wouldn‚Äôt work, sharpshooters can just team from a distance. 
---
oh
---
  Please ban him forever thanks
---
I am at 3.3k yet I don't have rico
---
It may not be top notch production, but it‚Äôs a really good idea
---
Nah the glitch is no longer work right now, super cell has fixed it already 
---
U could have just went out to kill him tho
---
Yeah but some of the top players already have more than enough gold . Also legendary should be hard to find right. The shop offer should not come directly when the legendary is released. It comes after 2 months
---
A man of culture, I see

It's fantastic

Ah k I don‚Äôt have freinds lol jk k will do

Exactly the same for me. Power 5 and she is kicking ass.

His chip damage type of Attack takes too Long to kill anyone and even if they have Low hp they just hide behind a wall anyways. Very bad brawler Mechanic

I (thankfully) got Tara points

Ah my mistake! I'm half asleep

this man is living in 4d, F for the great explanation 
---
Dynamike is a bad character in siege, but he would be good in here!
---
i don't know how he looks when losing, i don't have crow and my friends don't have that skin
---
Super or star power? If star power... I'm ftp with 5k barely :(. If just super, as you say, doesn't compensate for her health, damage or reload speed. How many trophies do you have btw?
---
It's a joke. Who doesn't want more power points?
---
But dynamike still cant go to the middle to pick up those nuts or what those are called
---
The most astounding thing to me is that there are no other brawlers killed in this time frame at the start of the match.
---
10000 IQ, were you in a team?!
---
Are u referring to u/Kent2D?
---
gene looks like he's looking at you like: "WHAT? HOW CAN YOU SUCK THAT BAD?" so why not crow?
---
r/woooosh maybe?

I can guarantee you, on men's day, we won't get jack shit. We didn't get anything for men's day in clash royale either

Hey could i use this video for my youtube channel OmgItsVaid if its okay with you?
---
How can I got a new braweler last time I get braweler at least 3 months ago and when I save my box and open 100 daily box and 12 big box same but I don't get any new braweler please solve this and I want a new braweler because some time opponent have legendary braweler and that time I don't have any good braweler to defet opponent brawler please give me a new braweler please
---
I have a completely different idea for dealing with matchmaking, I just haven't gotten around to making a post about it yet. I see it as an already existing problem. This may exacerbate the issue with the way things currently are, but with a fix to the problem that already exists, that should no longer be a concern.
---
I don‚Äôt think you can call someone dumb three times then call the stoopid and say no offense like u r off the hook

Yup. Someone said that I couldn't handle comments when I pointed out how their constant tagging of Gedi was annoying
---
OP is talking about getting points ON MENS DAY, in November 2019

Hey, dev team. Is the luck system in the game going to be changed at all? I have who I double the throphies of and he doubles my brawlers.
---
The robot gang be flexing hard on us
---
get outa here nub

That's honestly pathetic but I wouldn't expect anything else from "cybersport is srs bsns" clans. Saddens me people can't just enjoy the game without the stupid trophy rat race. 
---
I played cr for awhile and it was a lot more p2w and the cancel button didn‚Äôt work ever, and the meta was really dry even though they had 70 cards
---
What did you just say?
---
Hi-5 I was using Bo. Havent used him since I gotten him. And I thought I should take him for a spin ;) I'm around 3.6k+ trophies btw. So thats a huge gap from 3k!

What is the best brawler on brawl stars?
---
I no but I was waiting for him to return but he never came back
---
666
---
I can always tell when a Crow is on my team because we sure could use some damage. 
---
I think it will make the game too long before even it starts...
---
T-series ain't nothing but a Bitch lasagne!
---
Are you planning to allow people to change their name more than once? Personally I would like it.
---
Gone wrong
---
Better then the people who got them for new Mortis skin. üòÇ
---
What's worse is that many are doing it and you continue to do so. We're not being toxic, just telling you guys to stop tagging him. If you even want to stop the argument, then just keep quiet.
---
Lol, you guys are impersonating the older comments üòÇü§£
---
Wait whaaaat I thought i‚Äôd just seen a similar conversation 
---
nice*
---
I wish I got penny points, I want to get her to atleast level 9
---
considered?
---
If you‚Äôre a grammar freak, shouldn‚Äôt you use proper grammar then?
---
Seems fake.
---
I would play tic tac toe with a kitchen knife on my forearm
---
Bet the dynamike wishes he upgraded to level 8 before the match...
---
Hey bro! Congrats for 10k with just 19 brawlers.
---
Btw I am that frank ;)
---
Hard flex spinning on them like that. Nice work. 
---
I still got 3 more brawlers to get , Crow , Pam and Leon. Happy times lol
---
Am I the only one who doesnt get it?
---
CONDOM MAMA
---
ITS FAKE GOD DANGIT
---
need some work on face bcuz it has valentine day face .costumes and other stuffs makes it awesome.
---
Why am I not ever getting any fucking brawlers?
---
Nice but too bad they nerfed him into oblivion he's just average at best.
---
As a Spike, I often rely on my friends to block the bulletsü§îü§îü§î
---
cool and enough to satisfy old school rico fan.
---
Karma suicide.
---
Would be an idea. Other things I thought about:
---
ISLAND BRAWL (However, I think it is to close to Island Invasion) , BRAWL WARS, THE VOID, SKY ISLANDS, NARROW SQUARE, BRIDGE BRAWL
---
Pls remove some piper phrases, this is a kid game!
---
Spinning in SD as a taunt is toxic compared to to 3v3 that isnt so bad unless you got destoryed on Bounty thats pretty painful to feel
---
I fell bad because people like you wait so so long to get a legendary but I got Leon at like 14k trophys like a month after getting the game
---
Everyone should team, and betray right away. There would never be large groups 
---
You‚Äôre a genius!!
---
It could be worse: https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlstars/comments/avdtxm/well_this_was_a_bit_unfair/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share

Yes definitely if he can join the team as a concept artist. Here since Supercell open a position for 3D character artist recently, I thought I would clear things up between digital art and 3d character art. 
---
It would be perfect!
---
A legit cactus will win 
---
I spam super
---
Thank you!
---
You good
---
Nah I prefer landscape better.
---
Y he sage mode
---
Will anyone get to hug Spike without bleeding?
---
So carl isnt out yet still and its not just android hate again lol
---
It would also create false reporting if you lose and you are mad and and report anyone.and more confusion and trouble for supercell.
---
I hate how much people are against the battle pass idea I would love to get some extra skins and stuff from a battle pass system

Thats alot coming from a "**Primo**"
---
It's easy to organise)
---
Ironic
---
Nah man. I once had a genius Nita on my team become a fidget spinner infront of the goal for way too long and the enemy ended up killing her and stealing the ball. They ended up winning the game. Deserved
---
Please give Leon a remodel
---
Only maxed dynamike can do it. Other brawlers will have to suffer.
---
Removed - DO NOT SUBMIT POSTS WITH TITLES IN ALL CAPS. CAPS LOCK IS CRUISE CONTROL FOR COOL
---
 Meanwhile Ive maxed every brawler and I don‚Äôt even have one 500 trophy brawler
---
Don't we have a report char function?
---
I got 5m 28s with randoms 
---
Ah my mistake! I‚Äôm half asleep
---
Yes, then i will probably get them to mortis
---
Asshole you can't understand that supercell's guys can do a 3D model for a 2D model ? 
---
Idiot
---
YOOOOO. Really important question. Can you guys bring back the old super button? I always mess up my shots/super because I try to hit one and hit the other and it‚Äôs annoying. I‚Äôm not saying force everyone to use the button, just make it an option in our settings. 
---
You have to understand that the goal of showdown is survival. So, if Bull kills you after all of this, that means that he is smarter than you, not that the game is broken. You should be more careful. 
---
You're SO lucky! I know people who have been playing since beta day 1 and doesn't have a single legendary! 
---
I have 4.4k and still don't have any Legendaries
---
r/uselessredcircle
---
Lol yeah we actually won that match
---
Any Clan Wars with some rewards?
---
Like in CoC or CR
---
Cool
---
Can I ask how u calculated that and with that percentage how many boxes would I need to have a 100% chance
---
That's true man.
---
She took the photo in front of the mirror
---
That feel when you realize that this skin is better than the usual BO skin
---
I know teaming is bad, and that I support the #stopthespin movement, but I anti-team, which involves fake teaming with Leon, getting close, and killing the tamers I just "teamed" with.
---
So maybe just add new options to showdown, to say if you want to team or not, and only match you with people with the same choice.
---
Everything in your post should apply to the not-teamer mode, but no the teamer exclusive mode. 
---
Feel you..
---
Thank you pal :)))) 
---
I wanted crow but it gave me gene offer instead -.- 
---
Old times
---
So the attack speed is also greatly increased.
---
Snake Prairie?
---
Sure np
---
Wow!
---
Still, he is good because he can do a lot of damage pretty fast. Taking that away will just make him useless. Even though you‚Äôre increasing his reload speed, you‚Äôre greatly reducing his burst damage 
---
Reupload and stolen
---
Fortunately, that blame could only be directed to Mike
---
Hey it's me again.I'm having extremely bad luck with opening boxes.I haven't got any more brawler with 50+ boxes straight.But my friend just needed 7 boxes to get Frank.Pls help :_|
---
Idk why but i cant access invites
---
I know we do, but that wont stop them. 
---
People asking Supercell to hire him has nothing to do with his ability as a 3D artist, it has to do with the concepts of the skins he makes. In this global economy they could 1099 him for his 2D concepts he‚Äôs already making and pass those on to 3D artists at the company to create and put in the game. 
---
They don‚Äôt even need to offer him a full time position. Artists get contracted all the time for stuff like this it‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs uncommon in the industry...
---
They should push the coin rewards to the early game and gems to late. I think high trophy players deserve free gem rewards. No matter how much money you spend on the game, it takes some heavy grinding to get about 10k
---
this squidward format isn‚Äôt supposed to be used as the drake format (this is completely irrelevant to your post, sorry :p)
---
Yep, don‚Äôt land on your elbows kids

(Me is n0T g00d at english)

Divide showdown game into can-do-teaming and non-teaming map

hello good work and great game, I would like to know if you are going to put a Nagual, are the typical shamans of America, and the game is inspired by that, for example attacking with spirits of wolves and the ultimate creating a great Elk like Nita

Are you guys thinking about a manner to stop teaming in solo showdown?
---
Mine was 14 coins today
---
I want to be a dev too so can you tell me that did you write whole game from scratch as it was an ios game before. And which language did you use to make this android game. 
---
Bro what do you mean "atleast level 9" ? Level 9 is the last level. 
---
Dear developers, on what basis did you block my account forever, for some kind of phishing ??? I played on my account, only gave to a friend through the ID code, and that's it. And for me because it‚Äôs not my account, are you serious ?!

Crow‚Äôs poison will stack or his star will heal him from the poison 
---
Oof

The question is: is there anyone who actually likes White Crow?

The artpiece already has its watermark.

Pick off low health enemies when their not expecting it

Hust get it
---
A guy in my clan just tilted 200 trophies (500-300) of his crow
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs luck. I know people at 7,000 with no legendary and I know people at 1500 with a legendary 
---
Holy that is awesome!
---
Ay, whole gang is here. ~COOL 
---
Actually crow is good in showdown however he cant really hold his own in any other game modes. His overall and burst damage is just not high enough for anything other than showdown which is why i can agree that a real buff would be appreciated. However alot of people with crow cant use his high skill cap capabilities
---
I know i just kinda wanted to post it
---
Lmao hey :)
---
I got for tara
---
mfw the brawler's a robot

take my upvotes

Bro chillI was also giving by opinion

Who knows, it might be the next King Rico skin. 
---
17 / 23 Missing Penny, Mortis, Gene, Spike, Crow, and Leon. Pretty sad because I played pre-release
---
I was referring more to the fact that is was a bad match up, all tactical brawlers. And not sure how your math justifies anything but you do you.
---
But I‚Äôm Darryl... roll roll
---
Gemgrab, bounty, showdown and duo showdown (he is map dependent in most of these modes, but if you have the right map he‚Äôs really good)
---
Nice work bro.

supercell said it might be later than mid march so idk

Hi supercell........soon I came across and familized with everything.....only the disappointment was that there is no use of clubs.....there must be something like trade and clan wars..

It says 99 but there is no line.

Bad editing. Unfunny jokes. Dead Memes. Watermark.

Wha? I don‚Äôt get it either?

I started the day the game got released i'm 8.1k with all brawlers unlocked.

That could have alot to do with it but u must admit there are far stronger options than crow. *cough* *cough* PAM

ok

Stop

I was playing showdown and in the center of the map there was 5 people in a team, i just cried
---
Wow this is amazing! Could you do one with dyanamike or Frank? It's so cool.
---
But that's still teaming :/
---
I already posted the remodeled map
---
Yea, there is no way you'll win to him. 
---
Still friends?

Great idea, only problem is there are teamers who will use this exploit to gain trophies.

Good randoms are hard to find, and when you do they slip from your fingers like sand

U need 83 boxes to be 100% sure that you get him.  40 boxes so it becomes 50/50.üòÇ I have 20.

So my chance is 25%.

How do I get mythic and legendary brawlers?

---
Wait colt is a junker?
---

Kinda surprised they lost, that was rough lol

Is it against the rules to play poorly? This would lead to people reporting randoms that make one bad play... That's an awful idea.

---
Also bro i have all the other brawlers so will this increase my chance?
---
I have 23/23
---
Maybe he just lagged? Idk
---
would you be making it for more brawlers 
---
We laughed so hard, pure madness 
---
Any chance we can change the way we observe games? It's an unfair advantage to be able to see everything on the map. Observers should only be able to see from the point of view of who they're watching.

It's strategic. You play until time comes when you're tired and you mess up so you gotta rest. This is to prevent from messing up more and losing more trophies...

---
Ah, i see you're a man of culture as well.
---
An app called game launcher and when you go into your game there will be a small red circle on one of the sides and you tap on it and hit record

Well... no viable for balance play, just use bull a easy win

Hey Brawl Stars Team.I will only ask 1 thing.I am at 2000 trophies and I only have Penny.I unlocked many boxes and played this game.This game is the best game I‚Äôve ever seen.I suggested and rated this game and it is also so well-done.Please I just have 1 character that is dark blue and more.My point is I‚Äôve like to have a new character.I looked the chances and tried many times.It doesn‚Äôt give any.Should I wait still?
---
Logic OP. Both of you take my upvotes 
---
Yes officer, he‚Äôs right here
---
I have an update up on my profile. That should make for more fair play. :-)

Yeah it literally has the persons name who made it right there. Can these kids read???
---
How did you do it? Get trophy's without battling?

Awesome :)

Is your autism poking through right now or?

Can't wait for that sweet sweet 10% damage reduction?
---
Such a trash star power.

It should be a percentage.

You lose 50% of your gems/coins and brawlers cups.

It is a big punch to your progress, but way lesser to having to create another account and start from scratch.
---
Behind The Meme is that you?

You should put your watermark on the water so no one steals it

Wow, I would comment that you should use english, and not spanish in this english sub.

But, that is not even Spanish. Learn your own language! and don't use it here, use english.

Sorry for my grammar xd

Nah, just shitty for everybody else.

Playing in a &lt;100 trophy match against a power 10 is stupid. Then at 250+ it gets even more annoying, because a loss to this guy galavanting through requires another match to get the 5 trophies back.

In the future, would there be a chance of different terrain? For example, slopes where one can shoot down at others but enemies would have to ascend to shoot the person on the slope, or rafts across a river. I love the addition of the springs and I was wondering if there'd  be more like it. Thank you for all your hard work!
---
In a lot of those pictures the artist has written their name lol
---
Why not just set it to 0%?
---
Oh yes I do, but I just don't have reddit on phone so I just quickly took a picture and yeah....
---
It was found in the logs of the game, a 5v5 mode so I prefer to make maps first showdown 5v5. And no, when we die we can not live again 
---
you could put a button to report and as soon as we died for a team we reported and the team was wearing a banner
---
If this is legit, I doubt it affected your luck value.
---
Report and abort
---
I‚Äôm down. My brawlers are all maxed

With a bull or Shelly, go in the middle quickly and wait. Throwers might be a problem though

It's actually very dependent on how the code is written. I've coded different programs working with rng like this and I know a few cases where because the program is adding these objects into a box, a 0% rate would confuse the program due to it only reading what the percentage is, not really if there is a drop percentage at all.
---
What is it then
---
The poor birdie is the canary
---
Now I‚Äôm confused. I recall I had a much lower percentage at one point. Perhaps his was 1% and I just messed up my numbers

6:10 or something like that is the max time.. not 5m
---
He us a glass cannon so you be careful and try to dodge as much as you can.
---
Brawlers with long range like brock and piper counter quite well. 
---
Spike himself does a really good job of dealing with shorter to mid range brawlers. If you are really accurate with your shots multiple spikes can hit the target and deal massive damage.
---
Because spikes shoot out at many different angles you can use them to hit people behind walls and apply additional pressure when they are low on hp trying to heal, this makes him a decent counter to throwers sometimes.
---
His super is really strong, almost like tara‚Äôs. If you catch someone in it they are slowed down which makes it easy for you and your teammates to hit them and deal massive damage, it also can combo well with other supers like tara‚Äôs or Brock‚Äôs. It is a great counter to pam‚Äôs healing station because it provides long-lasting control of the area in its radius. 
---
At long range don‚Äôt auto-aim, try to be accurate to deal as much damage as possible, and try to memorize the directions the spikes fly out in so you can poke people behind walls

But those more difficult challenges might turn other people off of the game. Being placed with a giant task is hard for many who can only put 20 minutes into it a day. While smaller tasks with rewards at different increments will make it worth people‚Äôs time and encourage them to spend more time.

Nice edit i love it

We later did that when the 2nd Robot Boss came in
---
Essentially some time after Robo Rumble came out there was an exploit with Mortis that allowed him to infinitely leash robots around the map. Supercell patched it by enraging robots after a set amount of time.
---
Come the new RR maps there was a new exploit that allowed Primo to jump in one of the blocks and stall the robots. Supercell patched it again by removing the blocks in the map.
---
The final exploit came with abusing Mike's star power. Essentially using his star power he could jump over 2 walls, once again stalling the robots infinitely, although it was a bit trickier to do. Supercell finally responded by making the robots attack the safe after a set amount of time after they spawn, effectively killing all the exploits for now.
---
You fool those are player spawns, not gems!

Map gets taken over by throwers and ricos at higher trophy range. Only 2/3 shotgunners
---
It‚Äôs unpopular because it‚Äôs wrong 
---
You photoshop it??
---
I gave samples already. Example: get ATLEAST 6 kills in a showdown game. Get more than 15 power cubes on a solo showdown. Get 1st with at most 2 power cubes. Win with a friend 20 times of duo showdown. (Being in same game room.)
---
For those saying it's fake - I'll post gameplay later.
---
you need to be a supercell developer
---
r/ofcoursethatsathing
---
I think it will because the middle turn (2nd turn) in the river is in the center *and* accesable by jump pads
---
He can jump, fast, and poison is annoying
---
I‚Äôm a programmer and you should know that pretty much most software looks great to outsiders but is actually a bunch of garbage code stitched together with twine on the inside. This is because of the amount of different people working on it. As for Brawl Stars, their team‚Äôs small size keeps this to a minimum, but somewhat garbage code is inevitable. 
---
Happy to hear?
---
Yeah but its a weird delay where i hear the sound and nothing happens, where i would have stunned someone but i die because of the delay.
---
What's your player #?
---
My thoughts exactly. If supercell implemented a game mode that allowed 0 Trophy loss, that also let you gain of you won would break the game 
---
Landed right on top of them

A lot of people have had more than that

Are there any thoughts about adding a Persian language to a lot of Iranian players?
---
Agreed with it
---
I'm not worked up. It's cute, that you think I am. The same brawlers win the same matchups regardless of where they are at. Misplays don't effect tiers. Tiers are potential as mentioned in other post. Potential doesn't depend on skill. It's called a skill cap. And the cap literally cannot change. Noobs can play under it sure, doesn't change what the brawler is capable of. I can keep spewing facts, I don't mind (shruggs)
---
Wouldn't there be a thousand times more of the same brawlers if there are challenges like use poco 50 times or use barleys super 100.

the early indicator is a brutal dictator

Lol here‚Äôs a new idea don‚Äôt play with randoms 
---
You will learn by doing, i follow brawl stars youtubers mostly for news.
---
They really don‚Äôt though what don‚Äôt you get the competition level is different from the 200 trophy range and the 500 trophy range 
---
A new player will do really well with Shelly up 2 200 trophies and start struggling past 300+ usually because players LEARN how to counter her better and she is no longer AS effective
---
And this is why she is currently ranked the lowest by Kairos. You don‚Äôt have to agree but this was the logic used
---
Lol I was planning on buying the store offer if I don‚Äôt get him.  I‚Äôm also starting to save again until he comes out

---
Will Leon ever get a skin?
---
i have seen that
---
I agree with this wholeheartedly. It's a pain in the neck and honestly discouraging experience to get teamed on by several throwers when you are a short ranged brawler. 
---
Ive seen bushes grow back?
---
r/quityourbullshit
---
OP got the informative text wrong.  Every brawler's informative text ends with an exclamation  point, not a period.  
---
To all those people who say they set it's chance really low, thats very unlikely.  Supercell would never take the chance of somebody unlocking it like that, especially since there's so many people playing the game after global release.  Its better, and way more likely, that they set Carl's unlock chance to 0%.  You don't have to have a brawler have a chance to unlock in order to store it in the game.
---
 
---
\#GGJ2Y0JU (from another one of his posts) and its fake
---
In low health  it's a very  effective  way to win! Especially   if all team attack together 
---
Leon must be great in showdown not excellent with all these teamers no one will ever team with a leon,
---
Dynamike. Hes really easy to push in trophies if you be good teams together in 3v3s

Oh just stop with the skin it has a good attack animation.

Would be nice if you are on losing team and get star player to not lose trophies, that way when you play well with randoms and lose cause they are bad you dont lose!

Are we gonna have a clash of clans/ clash royale cross over with brawl stars?

Hi im here why is everyone talking about me 
---
‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Oh wow, I didn‚Äôt notice that. Thanks you!
---
Like the idea, however, i would remove the jump things and  maybe make the "tunnels" on the sides less narrow. Now that they added a showdown map with green grass, i think this map actually has chances of getting in. Good job!
---
As someone who mains El Primo, I have to agree and disagree. I agree with you if most of the bushes have been destroyed because when engaging a Shelly or Bull, you kind of have to back up while punching them. If the giant bush is still intact, Bull and Shelly can easily get the jump on El Primo. 
---
I got a comment advising me, and it sounded like a good plan. It's almost no effort for me but for thieves it's a little extra work
---

Let me know how I can improve the map. Unfortunately the app doesn't have some decorations, I would like to add some trees... 
---
For this map, only Darryl, all day, every day
---
Xd
---
What else are you supposed to do with a character that has no range (without his super)? Compared to other close range brawlers: Shelly has more range, Primo has more health so he can approach easier, Darryl has a super that autocharges so he can always threaten people far from him, and Mortis is faster and can dash towards the enemy. Bull has literally no other strategy; ambushing and abusing cover are the only ways to play him effectively without his super.
---
aham ta
---
Hey! Thanks for the kind words! :)
---
The bandwidth of the wifi connection matters very little. Brawl just needs a around 250 kb/s. There's a long list of potential issues of why the wifi connection doesn't perform as well as 4G/LTE. 
---
The 15ms "ping" you measured via WiFi is to the nearest physical server. Comparing both WiFi and 4G pinging a server in Frankfurt or Dublin is more realistic. You can compare the results. Besides this, depending on the device used there's a host of additional issues - from shared wifi/Bluetooth antennas, to impractical placement of said antenna, etc.
---
On my Twitter account you can also find some additional insights re connectivity for Brawl.
---
1, there could be a custom gamemode for it, other than showdown.
---
2 and 3, I agree but what if only the extra powerups would drop on the map, and the others would be just added to your account simply?
---
Thanks for removing life leech and please don‚Äôt bring it back 
---
üëåüèΩ
---
Actually, I unlocked Spike when I had 1500 trophies. 
---
I think that this is a great idea, but the drop rates are too high for a game that earns money by people donating money into it. I think that the easiest change would be just making the brawlers drop the total amount of powerups they have +1. So a 0 power brawler would drop 1, a 2 power brawler would drop 3, and a 30 power brawler would drop 31 etc. It also makes teaming up to defeat more powerful brawlers not as viable, since it is just as effective (and more rewarding if you win) to fight alone with 11 powerups, rather than two people with 5

Heh. I use Poco for aggro

Supercell would never give us a method of permanently farming gems or gold. And that‚Äôs not a fault of Supercell, it‚Äôs just by doing this it would undermine their entire currency system. Why buy gems when you can just farm it in Showdown?
---
Literally everyone who has tons of downvotes in this post has much more knowledge. Your ignorance from the truth is hysterical. Calling us wintraders isn‚Äôt helpful nor is it true. 
---
Hows that possible!? He didnt even get the Coming in bla bla bla thingy! Weird.....
---
Oh no you didn't
---
The droprates were just an idea to introduce the readers to my idea, I agree the perfect, balanced rate is not found yet but we won't find it out unless it's live, in the game. The numbers could be ok for solo showdown but I feel like duo showdown should have a different odds-system.
---
I want a kill:death ratio counter in brawl
---
Si we :V
---
Farming would take some time, but I agree, the gem odds might be too high in my post.
---
Maybe that caused the update error.
---
Uh maybe just credit towards a mega box- one box for 100 kills
---
It‚Äôs a novel idea but unfortunately Supercell would probably veto it.
---
Exactly what is this knowledge? And what‚Äôs so ‚Äúhysterical‚Äù? Your bullshit is what‚Äôs hysterical here. Cheating is cheating, simple as that and the fact that you‚Äôre willing to try and justify it, that‚Äôs also fucking hysterical üòÇ
---
Good!

Check u/SrGrafo, the original meme format creator

The 4th barrel somehow had a bunch of rockets loaded in it for it's super
---
I would say to make them less brawler based because I didn't get poco until like 3 months into the game after getting like 6 other brawlers before him (one was a legendary)
---
Is a very good idea, because you also got skins gold tickets and gems i like it
---
well, downvote me if you want, but if i point with a flashlight to a bush to search for something, unless its made of a deflective material, the result on sight conditions is the same. for this im also taking in mind that 99% of the time bs takes place in the day, so lets not go about the results in nighttime cuz even of the result would be different, it doesn't apply to the fame anyways :/ although, if we had "caves" or "tunnels" in the game, it would be a cool sp to have better sight in those places (ik gem grab is on a cave but im not taking that in mind since it seems to be pretty well lighted there)

Legendary drop rate: Am I a joke to you?

Thank you, i enjoy your complement
---
Very cool
---
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt argue with me‚Äù this is exactly what I was talking about. 
---
I will always give some leeway, meaning I will admit when I‚Äôve been wrong on a lot of points.
---
So I have to ask you, when you say crow can beat pam are you talking about a 1v1 in showdown or in gem grab with teams? 
---
Gem grab the best game-mode so it is naturally the best choice for pro players. If we are arguing about gem grab I‚Äôll admit that a crow can win for sure because he has room to retreat a bit knowing his mid can fire a few shots to help keep the pam from pushing super far forward. In showdown crow will lose because he simply can‚Äôt fight a pam head on and stand his ground, he needs room to move which showdown doesn‚Äôt provide when there are other players or poison spread in the late game. 
---
TL:DR he can win in gem grab, I was talking about showdown
---
Im a crow main and uhhh (shhh no one tell him)
---
I feel like Brock is overrated and definitely not top 3 right now. Why is he S-Tier on Showdown? He does not work in general on Feast or Famine, Island Invasion, Cavern Churn, Stormy Plains. Only really good on Double Trouble, Thousand Lakes and Dune Drift. Feel like he should be B-Tier or A-Tier at the most.
---
Use the communication app Rune. You put in your trophies you have, and when you press quickplay, you'll be placed in a voice chat with another person with the same trophy level.
---
I feel like a solid kill incentive would solve it. 1 kill = 1 trophy 
---
Only in less that 300 trophies, this a +500 trophies tier list
