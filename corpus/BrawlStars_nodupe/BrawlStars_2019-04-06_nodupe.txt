Hate to be the one to tell you that you‚Äôre drawing needs some color other than that it‚Äôs really good 
---
Nah, this is one of my favorite maps, control the mid, if they go around start attacking their safe back, and if a teammate dies they can easily defend the safe since mid should be controlled
---
It's beautiful
---
The only way to counter this is with a max dynamike with his jumps
---
The sword looks sick!
---
By far the best version 
---
Damn brother, props
---
Sounds good. I wouldn't change the damage but I would change the range of the bounces 
---
Pam goes 10 meters. also I couldnt test bc I dont have piper
---
I bought it too
---
Holy shit man this was 52 days ago

Everyone lags on this game

Leon sees his prey so he can beat that 10 power up bull

Very amazing art, but I don't think I like the idea of a sharpshooting Frank, maybe change up the mechanics a bit, if you do that I think it'd be an great addition to the game, and Supercell might consider it. Very cool!!
---
Well of course Pam is 10 meters, she‚Äôs the size of the moon. Doesn‚Äôt mean the others aren‚Äôt as thicc as syrup.

so is poco sans

1) That could be easily abused if you decide to not play with any brawler but duplicates. Hence a triple Pam team or something worse.

I feel like something like this could work, but it could also break the game if you have like a primo stand in the way of the robot and stall. It would break the meta completely

I think they need to make it so Penny‚Äôs Mortar can‚Äôt reach the IKE. Bit of an unfair advantage when no other brawl can do that.

I bought leon when i had like 1.5k. Then i just got crow a few days ago at like 4.3k from a box.
---
Hard or easy?
---
Oh wow, you're so skilled that you need to win by teaming with others in a solo gamemode. Go ruin fortnite if you're this toxic.
---
I just post it cuz may supercell dont acced someone who have almost all brawlers here

ikr

What if your holding the gems up in the sky and die... I must know if theres an animation for that
---
rico's so good.
---
wholesome brawl stars be like
---
Is it possible to learn this power
---
I agree and disagree with you.
---
I believe Crow does not need a direct buff to his stats, but instead needs an indirect buff.
---
Crow is bad right now, not because he is weak but because of the meta, which is currently dominated by spawners by Jessie. Pam in particular is quite strong right now and is Crow‚Äôs worst matchup. 
---
I believe brawlers like Jessie, Penny, and Pam need a nerf since they are dominating a variety of different gamemodes and can almost entirely negate Crow‚Äôs entire kit because of his low damage. Even if you queue with the right people you will still see mediocre results because Crow‚Äôs viability is more so dependent on the opponents team rather than yours. 
---
Contrary to what you stated in your post Heist is one of Crow‚Äôs best gamemodes, and Gem grab is definitely his worst, mainly because of matchups. Brawlers like Pam and Jessie dominate in Gem grab, and Barley, who originally was a good matchup for Crow, has been buffed and is now a but too strong for Crow to beat sometimes, none of these brawlers are too prevalent in heist which makes it a relatively safe gamemode for him. 
---
TLDR: Crow needs a new meta, once we‚Äôve obtained that we‚Äôll be able to see if he truly needs a direct buff or not.
---
Hm, I never thought about it

He doesn't suck, he just has a high skill cap that you don't know how to play him.

Do you have any source of a lot of people quiting? Its normal that some people keep playing and some skip to other games.

I could not think of another effect :(

But even so Crow is still unique because of its agility.
---
Thanks for your opinion :D
---
F!!!
---
Robots are better than energy drink imo
---
Right
---
I do not even know if I draw it as it is :)
---
Because they don't care about salty reddit children. 
---
I mean Pam is pretty darn hard to counter, and has a gradual heal. Crow has a gradual poison, and those don't mix. So I think Crow is fine, considering even Poco and Gene were affected by the Pam meta, getting kicked out of the brawler meta.
---
Lmao he does. What can he do better than any other brawler? It's damage is crap, health too, and wall-bouncing bullets have so short range, that he won't even shoot farther than 2 tiles (unless he is right next to the wall, which mainly causes him die in 1 shot from the enemy standing on the other side) 
---
If having 3 times less chance than others really makes you fell that he's not useless but requires skill, then why you keep shouting "BUFF CROW, BUFF CROW"
---
Just compare him to colt, it's worse in every aspect, it can even penetrate the walls. Only it's super can do something...
---
I remember being on your team I swear. We had an own goaling Primo so of course I would remember :D
---
"Spike Spike" would fit!

Nita - teddy bear

I swear you've asked for the videos a thousand times but ok

I would like for it to glow in the apropiate color of the (possible) brawler we unlocked.
---
Green = rare
---
Deep blue = super rare
---
Purple = epic
---
Red = mythic

Yellow/gold = legendary

That would be Lovely AND sick AND also would have a bit of mystery about who did we unlock! (Not really working/not really a surprise for anybody who has every brawler though.)

It is a server glitch. I was in two battles, but only one worked and i lost 4 trophy.

Isn‚Äôt that better than this one.
---
I'm not talking that she's too op while dodging. I'm talking about her needing a nerf because her attack isn't very easy to dodge...
---
Squad showdown..?
---
.. fire effect = crow
---
..super needs to be the same name as the big ‚Äúinsert main attack‚Äù.. they‚Äôre the same! ( I am not only talking about u , even supercell did this with colt and rico) 
---
good star power
---
drawing similar to penny, when I saw it I thought it is a skin for her!
---
rating. 1/4 or using mathematics ( lol I am also good with math , not only kairos ) 1/4 = 2.5/10
---
You gave me an idea(thanks!)
---
The jump between 300 ‚Äî&gt; 500 is massive.
---
Do it in small chunks - perhaps 40 trophies a day or whatever, and before you know it you‚Äôll be 500.
---
Poco is currently out of the meta, at least I rarely see him in any mode. When I got Poco 500, he was completely overpowered, and I got about 120 trophies in an hour (I don‚Äôt think I actually lost). 
---
Poco is a tough one, but all I can say is make sure you hit as many people as you can with his main attack, and don‚Äôt feel held back to use his super - it charges very quickly, so is easily renewed. Also, don‚Äôt play play super aggressive - if you have 3 gems, and there‚Äôs 2 on the ground but you slightly risk dying, just don‚Äôt go for them - 3 gems is better than none.
---
Just make sure to play Poco as a support, and not an aggro, and you‚Äôll slowly get there. 
---
Rinse and repeat; rinse and repeat.
---
Hope this helps! :D

I consider 1000 point token doubler to be a delayed 10 boxes = one megabox with more power point dispersal. Meanwhile They dont seem to hand put megaboxes for 29 gems, so....
---
How did you get three colours in ur name I thought the max was 2 (white and colour of choice)
---
ok yes so the cacti are there so you dont get mowed down by sharpshooters but you get mowed down by sharpshooters
---
How about that in the first round or two, bolts are less random*, as getting one or two lucky bolts spawn next to you means a lot to both getting a bot up and keeping control for the rest of the game.
---
As the game progresses, bolt spawns become more random since there's so many spawning that unfair spawns on one side for the entirety of the round won't really happen.
---
*and by less random, I'm thinking - for the first round as an example - exactly 2 on the left and right each, and two in the middle. Probably would go like: R, L, M, R, L, M. Obviously R/L will be switched around depending on which side you're on.

as i said, every account without crow gets this offer today

No one really cares if you got a brawler, especially when its an epic

Why does she need a remodel? She looks just fine how she is!

No, I know it is not a bug I‚Äôm just joking

That situation wouldnt work like that, Spikes (Even 1 spike) Would rekt leon under 1 second cuz of that hiight damage. Be realistic

Ya noticed barleys hat colours on his default skin?

Need this 
---
Honestly tho giving leon a nerf would be a huge mistake, his only mode where he is arguably best brawler is showdown and even then if people don‚Äôt feed his super he isnt that much of a threat. In 3v3 he is good in gem and siege but not amazing, people learnt how to counter leon and I feel like he became a pretty high skill cap brawler in 3v3 modes. 
---
If they want to change leon, Imho they should just rework him somehow.
---
That is a very true statement 
---
From what it seems in this thread, you seem super lucky! Congrats!
---
ok, but how about the pierce on showdown? I mean it's great for hiding near boxes and attacking the enemy through them, but that's about it. Her super on showdown wouldn't be that great there, would it? And I agree on carl. Without the star power and walls his dps is nonexistent. His super is good though
---
I got all characters but not recently other then Carl

Okah, I tried. 
---
That‚Äôs what I thought it was because of how rarely I go up in trophies so I never see mega boxes
---
Waves?
---
Rip good picture
---
Smh i posted this idea just with worse art... U stole the idea tho
---
I disgust me 
---
r/woooosh

*Have the most HP in my team while the rest of my teammates are about to die while also with me being furthest away from everyone*
---
This:
---
You didn't put spawn points.
---
Brock and crow combined
---
Why don‚Äôt you open boxes?
---
Really well done, i love how you made the corners of the map forests and what seems to be hills
---
I've seen worse,meh.
---
I knew that it was missing something when I was done, guess that was what it was.
---
Let's goo :D
---
This should be an exclusive skin to players when they link their duolingo accounts to brawl stars
---
üò§
---
Unless you don‚Äôt have tickets and want to play robo rumble
---
Or just buy both
---
acually everyone should be pam
---
lvl1 poco:
---
349 HP
---
Keep in mind that the enemy is burned, so there is extra damage and it takes a little longer to heal. :)
---
lol
---
Duolincrow
---
Level 1 crook vs level 100 boss
---
maybe...
---
Just cross your fingers that you don't spawn top left or bottom right..
---
Excuse me?it's me whenever i use my rank 18 shelly
---
Barley: (sees Tara) Someone get this girl a tall glass of remodel, stat!
---
Her laugh is so cute. Plus when Junkrat makes Fun of her voice line saying Cheers mate the cavalry is here , Tracer is like Oy thats my line. God i love OW
---
I‚Äôd love these
---
... i have none 
---
Ikr
---
I love mortis, it‚Äôs more fun compare to other brawlers. i‚Äôm too at rank 15, but mortis rn seems a little too weak for me. i think it really needs a small buff (what i said earlier), not a significant one. 
---
from her......
---
I just want a 1v1 duel mode
---
all 3v3 modes are trash showdown is the only good mode
---
Leon doesn‚Äôt obey his curfew because he‚Äôll just turn invisible and leave
---
U ded
---
... how? I might be biased just because I‚Äôm a Tara/Darryl main, but personally really like her current model
---
Updates typically bring offers and level benchmarks
---
I would buy him
---
Spent so much time drawing that 4 square black thing on the gutair
---
ill take that as a compliment, thanks, it's much appreciated!
---
Because old Rico wasn‚Äôt thicc 
---
10- made me cry
---
I have leon and crow
---
Me too umMMmmM
---
Yes!
---
It is..
---
They can't they will need ids 
---
This is lovely
---
Let's make it 4, it's currently 5 if i'm not wrong 
---
cute !
---
c o l t - f o u r t y f o u r t r o p h i e s
---
Any1 actually got the meme? Lol
---
\*And a meteor robot
---
What do you mean "so?" Teaming is bad no matter which brawlers. I know there's a stereotype of dynamike teaming and mortis counters dynamike (unless they're agains me) but that doesn't justify them teaming. 
---
I got tara piper and spike around 4000 but it slowed down a lot after that
---
DO. MORE. OF. THESE.
---
there's acctually certain parameters for a brawlers class, for example heavyweights have the movement speed of 770,  healers heal team mates with their super attack etc.  
---
what all throwers have in common, is an attack that can go over walls, and follows a parabola like line in air. so I figured he'd fit in, even though he acctually shoots and doesn't physically throw something.  
---
thanks for sorting by new!
---
Just....How?
---
Wait for spike
---
Long schlong
---
The painful, horrible, but needed truth
---
Cool with rockstar mortrys 
---
honestly would love that lmao
---
Supercell said in the AMA that the Hoverboard dude isn't coming to the game, and that it was just something they were experimenting with.
---
But maybe he will still be added to the game later?
---
Gene
---
*loses100 trophies due to 7 teaming dinamykes*
---
N√§ytti enemm√§lt√§

Spray arrows

UwU
---
Wait till you use him he needs a buff
---
R/wooosh?
---
Lol wat
---
Hi! It's duo. Looks like the skin didn't come to the game. You know what happens now. 
---
I would buy this skin and only play with this one.
---
The damn bird means business 
---
You missed a spot
---
 Yes i did they werent randoms btw
---
Yeah I started and I can se why everyone wanted a crow buff but he‚Äôs still fun
---
Just doesn‚Äôt seem like it would be that easy
---
Hehehe
---
They were from the brawlstars discord
---
Piper has beauty sleeps
---
Sucky sucky love you long time
---
Play as shelly but fail because the primo is good and he jumps over your super
---
KNOCKKNOCKKNOCK FBI OPEN UP
---
i‚Äôll love her any day ;)
---
They earn money only by selling gems in the shop... F2p players don't bring them anything. That's why something like that will never happen
---
Now listen the truth.... My main acc. Is 6.8k and no legendary.... So when i saw new players getting legend.... Made a mini ID... And as u see i got legendary.
---
Im at 10k. I got my first epic Frank at 1.5k. Then Piper at 4k and Pam at 5k. I unlocked Leon at 8k and Crow at 9k. I have no mythics.
---
The super does 10,000 damage in a small area..
---
1. There are many ways to play a character. So let's say you're facing another shotgunner, then it wouldn't be good to play Crow as a shotgunner while it would be if they aren't. Different opponents require different playstyles.
---
Game is definitely toxic at upper levels of trophies. Teammates sitting in spawn intentionally. Teaming in solo showdown. Bad decisions from randoms all the time.
---
#GENE
---
Oh how do I do do it
---
Someone up for robo rumble? Lvl 7/8 (Bull, Jessie, pam)
---
XWS4EHS9C

^gene
---
I will fucking murder you in your sleep. With the gun I just got. Slit your throat 
---
There should be 1488 max tropheys
---
r/ihadastroke
---
I learned that from rey lol...He always says: ok guys if we get a 6 we have a new brawler, cmon, give me itttt, oh nevermind...another 5 haha
---
Doesn‚Äôt matter how easy it is to hit someone if you only take 10% of their health. I‚Äôd much rather shoot 3 daggers in a row than 3 split up. 
---
BoOm BeAcH

Nicest

This will 100% be on coach corys meme review üòÇüëèüëè
---
Wrong sub mate
---

---

---
We need more posts like this ! Really cool !
---
LNerfing Pam according to Karios.
---
 is the franCk newest brawler?
---
I hate it when that happens... At least give us a box come on
---
No need for the colons, my dude.
---
Ya kinda frustrating.  I have a friend who's f2p at 2700.  He's got Leon, Mortis, Gene, Tara.  I don't understand it.  
---
My cousin is f2p and 3400 and has Crow and Spike but no mythics.
---
you guys won so this proves skill&gt;P2W virgins
---
Do you know you can get banned for ysing private servers? I also didnt know that untill I watched havoc's video today and also its against supercells terms of service.
---
If you look closely those are the same bottles barley uses so shes pretty much poisoning herself
---
This would be so hectic but great to play :)
---
when ur disconnected and the bot that takes your place "loses" you lose trophies. BUT WHEN YOU WIN WHILE BEING DISCONNECTED YOU DONT RECEIVE ANY TROPHIES FOR WINNING AS A BOT?
---
Far and away the best game mode!  It should be available all the time.
---
Oh dear lord sorry
---
you are free to play. thats why everyone wants to play you   #oof
---
THIS AIN'T MY FIRST RODEO
---
7.567567123578478245784 out of 10
---
I don't have mortis gene and piper
---
LEVEL 69 WOULD BE BETTER
---
WTF
---
Feel good video. Thanks 
---
TE VAS A DORMIR CON LOS PESCADOS
---
No buff to crow!
---
Lol love that you recreated the original meme to make it Brawl Stars related! Well done!
---
Top!
---
Yes, i check up it now
---
His point is the caption should be ‚Äò10 power Leon vs 2 power Crow &amp; Giant Robot‚Äô
---
I was about to do this same kind of post as soon as I‚Äôd get a new brawler but I never get any
---
Band 
---
And don't forget about all the teaming Pams and throwers.
---
YESSS
---
To me the best brawlers for siege are Mortis, Pam, Bo, Tara, and Frank. For this game mode you want to play a brawler that can win a fight for bolts and can also deal a lot of damage to the Tower/cannon to the few that I mentioned are some of my favorites to play on pretty much any siege map.
---
Me: Kills Mortis, the undertaker
---
Everyone else at the funeral: .o.
---
I upgraded Shelly to Power 9 yesterday, after getting the remaining 89 power points from the shop for 178 coins. Today I pulled her star power from a free box and then proceeded to get Carl as well. 
---
If you‚Äôre wondering why I did it, there isn‚Äôt really any reason beyond wanting to set myself a challenge. 
---
Fffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff

7th was easy ngl
---
Nicester
---
Oh god, what did you drink, Primo?
---
Makes sense
---
frank gang !
---
I can be it if u wanna make the meme again lmao
---
Way too intrusive. The spam would get ridiculous 
---
not at all, but if we HAD to get a crow buf, i'd rather increase health by 200 and thats it, attack is prefectly fine tbh
---
This would be tough
---
Literally the quit button says you're a quitter.
---
The joke is so painfully obvious that I can safely assume that you are retarded 
---
How can you tell if he‚Äôs poisoned since he‚Äôs green?üßê
---
Splatoon 2d for android confirmed Ok no :v
---
So like, you know about the Will Smith guy?
---
The 4D itself don't exist
---
I know but still, compare her to Brock or something in terms of overall strength and you will understand
---
Yah check the rules
---
Dynamike &lt;----- Mortis &lt;----- Bull &lt;----- Shelly with Super &lt;----- My ego
---
Kill me
---
Gene: Supern‚Äôt
---
Shelly is trash rn, try to understand the meta in high trophies before you go and talk nerfs....
---
Pam be like don't nerf me please
---
i hope you well git a legendary brawler  !
---
you deserve it !!!
---
More like S-Tara
---
No he was saying it‚Äôs fake in another post and when I proved him wrong he blocked me lol
---
try saving boxes in the beginning of the season and opening at the end. saving too much will make your progress slow
---
This is available to download? I wanna try this...
---
Messing with the Chungis causes him to stealthily sit on you after going invisible
---
Specially in this game, where skill &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; money
---
wow so myTHICCal
---
Yeah that‚Äôs the only one I don‚Äôt agree with 
---
Ducrowlingo
---
Looks fine to me
---
well have you seen a cactus pee
---
I'm at 5.7k and i have all epics, mortis and crow lol
---
Old mike
---
Jesus I‚Äôm only 4600 and I have Leon and Tara 20/24 brawlets
---
Yeah fair fair I‚Äôm just messing around 
---
yeah we could easily beat you.... mwhaahahh asian reverse card
---
Ok?
---
No, it has to find you teammates and enemies with the same trophy count as the brawler your playing with. For example : you picked a 50 trophy shelly. The people you will be playing with will have a trophy count of 50 (or almost 50)
---
Bruh... she forgot to practice her spanish... _**HE'S**_ coming...
---
I think hitspeed would be more balanced at 2  seconds. She would be op on defense with 1 second. 
---
I feel like bull, shelly or leon should be there instead of jessie - they NEVER team. Ever.
---
better than mine 
---
I only spent 10.98‚Ç¨, so... Am I pay to win? üòÇ
---
Nice, I got all 3 epics within the same week, 2 of which I got in the same day (Frank and piper)
---
Carefully, he‚Äòs a hero.
---
Very true
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Nice :D how many trophies ?
---
Nice 
---
Absolutely not needed.
---
He want the butsek 
---
Haha wp :D 
---
Just like Ash and his son!
---
Wdym first released he has always been in the game
---
Yeah, she has a bandit skin too
---
Yeah It's okay ^^ Hope you'll get some more :p
---
wait for spike. 
---
Wanna end the game faster, and mhm if its my girlfriend, im already suicidal so yeah i would then
---
Noobs play SD real men play 3v3s 
---
